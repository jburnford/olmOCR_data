[{"id": "f3e18024baf8bf0d1a0e058b5d99c5f60515df3d", "text": "THE IMPERIAL GAZETTEER OF INDIA.\nCochin.\u2014Native State in subsidiary alliance with the British Government, and politically connected with the Presidency of Madras\u2014called after the town of the same name, formerly its capital, but since its capture from the Dutch in 1795, a British possession, and included within the limits of the District of Malab\u00e1r. That District bounds the State of Cochin on the west, north, and north-east; a small portion at the south-west is washed by the Arabian Sea; and the State of Travancore forms the southern boundary. It lies between $9^\\circ 48'$ and $10^\\circ 50'$ N. lat., and between $76^\\circ 5'$ and $76^\\circ 58'$ E. long.; and contains 7 Sub-divisions\u2014namely, Cochin, Cannanore, Mugundapuram, Trich\u00far, Tallapalli, Chitt\u00far, and Krangan\u00far. Total area, 1361 square miles. Population (1881) 600,278, namely, 301,815 males and 298,463 females.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The most striking physical feature of the country is the series of shallow lakes or backwaters, which receive the drainage of the numerous streams descending from the Western Gh\u00e1ts, and are consequently liable to great rises as these feeders swell, and to equally great reductions in volume as they dry up. One of these feeders, the Alw\u00e1i, has been known to rise nearly 16 feet in twenty-four hours; and the backwater into which it flows sometimes continues swollen for months, while in the dry season it shrinks in many places to a depth of 2 feet, and even to 6 inches at the northern and southern extremities. The Cochin backwaters extend from north to south for a distance of about 120 miles in all, passing considerably beyond the boundary of the State. Their breadth varies from a maximum of 10 miles to not more than a few hundred yards; and they are very irregular in form, branching into a great number of intricate and shallow channels, containing several low alluvial islands.\nThe communication with the sea is at three points\u2014one at the city of Cochin, another at Kodungal\u00far or Krangan\u00far, and the third at Chetuw\u00e1i or Chatw\u00e1i. Though the backwaters are in most places shallow, navigation is at all times possible from Cochin to Krangan\u00far, and from Cochin to Aleppi or Aulapol\u00e1\u00ed, both for passenger and cargo boats. During the rains, all parts are navigable by flat-bottomed boats; but for the conveyance of petty merchandise, canoes drawing little water are preferred. All the lands washed by the backwaters, whether islands or enclosing banks, are low and swampy, and liable to be flooded during the monsoon inundations. They are in general densely covered with luxuriant cocoa-nut palms; and in such places as are embanked, great quantities of rice are grown.\n\nThe chief rivers of Cochin are the Pon\u00e1ni, the Tattamangalam, the Karuvan\u00far, and the Shalak\u00fadi. The Alw\u00e1i or Periy\u00far also passes through a portion of the State. The timber of Cochin is amongst the most valuable of its products, the revenue derived from the forests in 1881\u201382 being \u00a35812. The principal timber tract is Iru\u00e1ri in the north-east, which is covered with dense forests of teak-trees of enormous size, but less durable and elastic than timber of the same kind produced in Travancore and Malab\u00e1r. It is consequently more in demand for building houses than for ships, for which latter purpose it is also rendered less suitable by being cut into short blocks, in order that it may be dragged to the torrents which sweep it down to the backwater. The violence with which it is carried down the streams often renders it unfit for purposes requiring wood of large dimensions. Other valuable descriptions of timber are peon or p\u00fan, of which excellent masts are made; and blackwood, angely, jack, ben-teak, and bastard cedar. The only mineral products which contribute to the revenue of the State are laterite and granite; for though both gold and iron were at one time worked, these industries have now died out. The flora, however, abounds in plants of commercial value. Besides the timber-trees already mentioned, the hills afford a great variety of drug, dye and gum-yielding shrubs; cardamoms are produced in many parts, and everywhere on the hills the jungle exhibits a splendid luxuriance of foliage and flowers. The fauna includes all the larger animals of Southern India\u2014elephant, bison, bear, tiger, leopard, s\u00e1mbhar, and ibex, with many varieties of deer. The hunting leopard, hy\u00e6na, wolf, fox, monkey, etc., are also found, and birds are very abundant, as also are snakes and other reptiles.\n\nHistory.\u2014The State arose out of the dismemberment of the Malay\u00e1lam kingdom in the time of Cheruma Perum\u00e1l, from whom, by right of lineal descent, the present R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Cochin claim to hold their territory. Cheruma Perum\u00e1l governed the whole country of Ker\u00e1la or Chera, including Travancore and Malab\u00e1r, in the 9th century, first as\nviceroy and afterwards as an independent ruler. Cochin early succumbed to the Portuguese, who in the 16th century built a fort, and established commercial and missionary relations with the adjoining districts. In 1599, the Archbishop of Goa convened a synod at Udi\u00e1mpur, at which the tenets of the Syrian Christians, then a large body, were declared heretical. In 1662, the Dutch took the town of Cochin from the Portuguese, and under their management it soon attained to great prosperity. A century later, the Zamorin of Calicut invaded the State, but was expelled by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Travancore, who obtained, as a reward for this service, a portion of Cochin. In 1776, Haidar Al\u00ed, the ruler of Mysore, overran the country, compelling it to become tributary; and in 1790, his son, Tip\u00fa, entered the State, and laid it waste as far as Virapal\u00e1i, when he was recalled to the defence of Seringapatam. It remained nominally under the authority of Tip\u00fa until 1799, when Mysore was conquered by the British. Already, in the preceding year, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Cochin had signed an independent treaty with the Company, by which he acknowledged himself its tributary, and agreed to a yearly tribute of \u00a310,000. In 1809, a conspiracy to assassinate the Resident and to commence hostilities against the British necessitated the employment of troops. After the pacification of the State, another treaty was concluded, binding the R\u00e1j\u00e1 to a yearly payment of \u00a327,000, and admitting the right of the Company to control the distribution of its forces in the State, and to demand increased payments in proportion to any increase of military expenditure on behalf of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, it being provided that in no case should his income fall below \u00a33500, in addition to one-fifth of the annual revenue. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 engaged to hold no correspondence with any foreign State without the knowledge of the British Government, to admit no Europeans into his service, nor allow any to remain within his territory without the consent of the British authorities, who might dismantle or garrison any fortresses in his dominions. On the other hand, the British undertook to defend the territories of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 against all enemies whatsoever. Subsequently, in 1819, the annual payment to the British Government was reduced to \u00a324,000, being one-half of the estimated revenue at that time; and at a still later period, the tribute was fixed at \u00a320,000, at which sum it remains at the present day. Since the date of this transfer of power to the British, Cochin has no history beyond that of internal reforms. In 1836, some changes were made in the levy of transit dues; and in 1848, the freedom of commercial intercourse between this State and the neighbouring Districts was further advanced by the removal of frontier customs' restrictions; thus, among other advantages, facilitating the passage of merchandise from Malab\u00e1r and Coimbatore to the port of Cochin. By the inter-portal convention of 1865, the\nsystem of inland transit duties was altogether abolished; the State agreeing to equalize the rates of customs' duty at its seaports with those obtaining at the ports of British India, and to sell salt within its limits at the price ruling in the District of Malab\u00e1r. In return for these concessions, the British Government guaranteed to the State a minimum customs' revenue of \u00a310,000, and a revenue from tobacco of \u00a31050 per annum.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The first Census recorded, that of 1820, returned the total population at 223,003; but the method adopted was defective, and it was not till 1875 that a satisfactory enumeration was accomplished. The total population then disclosed was 601,114 persons, inhabiting 120,220 houses. The returns of the last Census, taken on the 17th February 1881, gave the total population at 600,278 persons, or a decrease of 836 since 1875; number of persons per square mile, 441. The principal races are Malay\u00e1lis, Tamulians, Konk\u00e1nis, and Telugus. Divided according to religion, there were 429,324 Hindus, 33,344 Muhammadans, 136,361 Christians, and 1249 Jews. The Christians, of whom 15,422 are Protestants, form about 21 per cent. of the population; most of the remainder belong either to the Romano-Syrian Church, established here in 1659, and subject to the Archbishop of Malab\u00e1r, or to the orthodox Roman Catholic Church under the Archbishop of Goa. The Jacobite and Nestorian Churches, acknowledging the Patriarch of Antioch as their head, and established long before the period of European settlements, also number many members, a few being substantial landowners. The proportion of Christians is 3 per cent. higher than in the adjoining State of Travancore, and 19\u00b77 per cent. more than in the Madras Presidency generally. The Christians are massed in the neighbourhood of the sea-coast backwaters and lagoons, and almost monopolize the boating and fishing industry. Arranged according to local precedence, the Hindu castes stand as follows:\u2014(1) Br\u00e1hmans, who form 3\u00b76 per cent. of the population, and are generally priests and proprietors of land; (2) Kshatriyas, also generally landowners; (3) Ambalavasis, temple servitors; (4) Nairs, superior agriculturists and Government servants; (5) Pillais, subordinate Government servants; (6) Ottars, contractors for labour; (7) Vallamars, fishermen, cloth-weavers, potters, and artisans of all kinds; (8) Ezhuwans, agricultural labourers; (9) Chermars, agricultural serfs; (10) hillmen. Of these, the first four may be described as well-to-do, and the two last as wretchedly poor. The chief hill tribe is that of the Malayars or Kaders, living on roots, leaves, mice and other small animals, without fixed settlements or ostensible occupation, except occasional basket-weaving. The Vallamars, who live by fresh-water fishing, number 4000, but the sea fisheries are monopolized by the Marakan caste, who are more numerous. A considerable trade in\ncured fish is carried on along the coast, emigrants from Ceylon coming over annually to engage in it during the fishing season. Immigration affects the population returns to the extent of about 8000 annually, the new-comers generally settling in the State. Enumerations of the population have been made five times during the last 55 years, and the result up to 1875 had been to show a great and continuous, though not always uniform, increase. Up to 1875, the increase per annum in Cochin had been 1.86 per cent.\u2014a more rapid rate than in any of the chief European countries. The Census, however, of 1881 showed a decrease of 836 persons. The density of the population is 441 persons per square mile\u2014a number exceeded, however, in Tanjore. The luxuriant growth of the cocoa palm on the sea-shore and backwaters is the chief support of this heavy population. Little labour being entailed by this cultivation, abundant opportunity exists for further earnings. Nearly the whole produce of the country consists of special articles for export; the collection of which at the port of Cochin, by the endless network of canals, affords ample employment to boatmen, imported rice being distributed in the shape of return cargo. The fact that a sufficient fish diet is available at an almost nominal cost has an important bearing upon the material condition of the people.\n\nThe most populous towns are\u2014Ernakolam, the capital, with 14,038 inhabitants in 1875; Cochin, 13,775; Trichur, 11,109; and Tripunthora, the residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, 8493. Seven other towns had over 5000 inhabitants, and 47 more between 2000 and 4000, making the urban population 248,000, or 40 per cent. of the total. Smaller villages numbered 595, the average population being about 380. Later statistics for town and village population are not available. The tendency to gather into towns has become marked in recent years, while the proportion of tiled houses annually increases.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Rice forms the staple of cultivation, some 50 varieties being locally distinguished; the best land supports three crops annually. Next to rice, cocoa-nut engages the attention of the cultivators. Wherever a sufficiently light soil prevails, this tree is grown; and its products\u2014coir, oil, coprah, and the nuts\u2014form the chief exports of the State. Other crops are\u2014besides the usual cereals, pulses, and vegetables,\u2014cotton, coffee, indigo, betel leaf and areca-nuts, hemp, flax, sugar-cane, ginger, and pepper. This list illustrates the very diversified and fertile nature of the soil. Irrigation obtains only on a small scale, the natural rainfall usually sufficing for the crops. Manure, where necessary, consists chiefly of vegetable refuse, leaves, bark, etc., and the ashes of burnt wood. Of the total area of the State (871,359 acres), nearly one-third, or 288,125 acres, is under cultivation, divided among 66,250 separate registered proprietors; the assessment ranging\nfrom 6s. an acre downwards. The yield of an acre of superior rice land averages in value \u00a37, 3s.; that of inferior land, \u00a34. The majority of cultivators do not hold more than 5 acres, from which they obtain the equivalent of about 16s. a month. Most of them cultivate their own land, and tenants-at-will are rare. Rent was, till the present century, paid in kind; but, after several tentative standards, it has now been roughly commuted at about one-fourth of the value of the produce. Beyond this, no regular conversion of rents into cash has been introduced, nor do any of the revenue regulations of British Districts obtain here. The proprietary right in the soil rests either in the Government or private persons. In the former case, the tenants occupy for the most part on, nominally, simple lease, held direct from Government, but about one-fifth of the whole is in reality mortgaged to the tenants. Only two kinds of land are fiscally recognised\u2014'rice land' and 'garden land,' the former being assessed by the area under crops, and the latter by the number of trees upon it. Cocoanut palms, jack fruit-trees, and palmyras pay the highest rates, which range from 1s. 10d. per tree down to 2d. Where no trees exist, the crop is assessed at about 1s. 4d. per acre. Various imposts supplement the kanom or land-tax proper,\u2014the chief being ketut-thengu, levied upon every 100 trees, after each has been taxed individually; nekudi, a royalty collected by the State on the rents of private lands; and mapura, taken from all holdings above a certain size. Wages have doubled in every branch of labour during the last 20 years, and now average for a carpenter or bricklayer 7d. per diem, for a smith 10d., and for a day-labourer 5d. Prices of food have increased in even greater proportion; rice, which in 1851 was at 3s. per maund (or 4s. 1d. per cwt.), cost in 1871, 6s. 6d. (or 8s. 10d. per cwt.). The price of all other grains has risen proportionately. This rise, however, does not much affect the poorest class of day-labourers, for they receive the bulk of their wages in kind, at the old rates of about 4 lbs. of grain per diem for an adult male, 3 lbs. for a woman, and 2 lbs. for a child, the rate of commutation being generally fixed at 5d., 3d., and 2d. per diem for each. Among the urban population an increasing prosperity is marked by the improved class of dwellings erected, and by the more general distribution of luxuries. The monthly expenses for a household of the average shopkeeper class would be \u00a34, those of an average peasant \u00a31, 10s.\n\nCommerce and Manufactures.\u2014In spite of its favourable configuration for commerce, and its great natural resources, Cochin possesses no important trade by sea or land. The total number of vessels which called in 1881\u201382, at the ports of Mallipuram and Narakal, was only 82. The port dues amounted to \u00a3542. Except in the coffee cultivation on the Nelliampatti range, European capital has not yet been attracted\nto the State. In the Cochin and Kanayan\u00far tiluks, ornamental work in metals, and carving in wood and ivory, are carried to a point of great excellence; and the hardware and arms here manufactured command a sale beyond the limits of the State. The timber produced in the forests, and the salt manufactured along the coast, are Government monopolies, and yield a large revenue. The old tobacco monopoly was abolished in 1862. Among local products, the cocoa-nut palm supplies in its nut and fibre an article of export; but the others\u2014areca-nut, ginger, oil-seeds, pepper, etc.\u2014are only locally interchanged. The Madras Railway approaches the State at Shoran\u00far, where there is a station. The principal exports, besides rice and the products of the cocoa-nut already mentioned, are pepper, cardamoms, and timber.\n\nMeans of Communication.\u2014In consequence of the great extent and facility of water carriage, and of the impediments presented by torrents, backwaters, and inlets of the sea, the construction of roads has, until recently, been little regarded; but there are now 133 miles of good road in the State. The longest and most important line runs nearly parallel to the sea-shore, and on an average about a mile from it. This forms the principal military and official route between Travancore and Malab\u00e1r. Its continuity, however, is frequently broken by the water channels which cross it. In the less swampy parts about Trich\u00far, there are some excellent portions of road, for making which the prevailing formation of laterite is well suited. The Cochin Government has always readily assumed its share in works common to the State and to British territory, such as the protective works at Cruz Milagre (where an opening of the breakwater into the sea threatened by diminishing the scour over the Cochin bar to impair the value of the harbour), and the improvement of the West Coast Canal for a length of 30 miles where it forms the boundary of the State. Again, when a cart-road was projected to connect Pon\u00e1ni with the southern end of the Shoran\u00far bridge, and thus with the railway without the necessity of fording the river, the Cochin Government readily undertook the cost of the length lying within the State. There is now water communication (canals and backwater) for 45 miles between Cochin and Trich\u00far, and smaller canals branch from this line along its length. Throughout this water system considerable traffic is carried on for nine months of the year, for the remaining three (the hot months) the communication is often interrupted.\n\nReligious and other Institutions.\u2014Public libraries, aided by State grants, have been established at Ernakolam and Trich\u00far; and the numerous missions represented in Cochin support printing-presses, private schools, and societies for the advancement of knowledge. The Catholic mission has a large number of educational institutions. The\nOfficial Gazette of Cochin is the only periodical publication. Charitable endowments, providing for the maintenance of Br\u00e1hman travellers, are attached to all the pagodas; and the State also grants aid to many establishments for the support of the local Br\u00e1hman population. The total expenditure on religious and charitable endowments amounts to \u00a311,732 per annum. Religious gatherings are held annually at all the chief pagodas; the attendance at the most important\u2014that held at Krangan\u00far, and lasting for ten days\u2014averages 12,000 per diem. At all these gatherings a large interchange of local produce is effected.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The State of Cochin is not subject to famine, the ample means of communication which it possesses placing it beyond the likelihood of such a visitation. Nor are destructive floods or droughts known. A local inundation or deficiency of rainfall may at times have caused temporary loss, but there is no case on record of an entire harvest having been destroyed.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The State is divided for administrative purposes into 7 taluks or Sub-divisions, each supervised by a tahsild\u00e1r, the local head of the police, revenue, and magisterial administration, assisted by a subordinate native staff. In matters of revenue, the tahsild\u00e1rs are under the direct control of the Diw\u00e1n, or chief magistrate of the State, and responsible adviser of the R\u00e1j\u00e1; while in matters of police or criminal justice they are subject to the Diw\u00e1n-peshk\u00e1r (the chief assistant of the Diw\u00e1n), who is assisted by a Deputy. Civil justice is administered locally by five muns\u00edfs, possessing jurisdiction in civil suits up to the value of \u00a350, and by two zil\u00e1 courts. The Court of Appeal, the highest tribunal of the State, has unlimited powers, both civil and criminal, subject only in sentences of death and imprisonment for life to the confirmation of the R\u00e1j\u00e1. The administrative headquarters of Cochin are at Ernakolam; but the R\u00e1j\u00e1 resides at Trip\u00fantora, 5 miles distant. The Penal Code of British India has been partially introduced into the State, and also a Registration Act modelled upon our Act viii. of 1871. The total revenue for 1881\u201382 amounted to \u00a3144,928; the total expenditure, to \u00a3133,426. In 1809\u201310, the revenue was only \u00a358,716; and the expenditure, \u00a350,370. The chief items of income (1881\u201382) were\u2014land revenue, \u00a363,539; customs, \u00a311,619; salt, \u00a318,353; and excise on spirits and drugs, \u00a34270: principal items of expenditure\u2014subsidy to British Government, \u00a320,000; R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s establishment, \u00a318,516; administration (judicial, revenue, and police), \u00a323,348; religious and charitable endowments, \u00a311,732; public works, \u00a315,769. The police force numbers 217 men, and costs annually \u00a31470. During 1881\u201382 they arrested 3391 persons implicated in 1397 cases, obtaining only 654 convictions, while the remainder were either acquitted or discharged. Owing to the peculiar system of police administration obtaining in the State, these\nfigures do not convey a correct view of the working of the Department, the reorganization of which is under contemplation. There is no village watch such as obtains in the neighbouring British Districts. The daily number of prisoners in jail during 1881-82 averaged 134; the charges for the maintenance of the jails were \u00a3381; average cost per head, \u00a32, 16s. 10d. Education costs the State \u00a32646 annually, the chief institution being the High School at Ernakolam, with an average daily attendance of 213 pupils. Five Anglo-vernacular, one Hebrew-Sanskrit, and seven Malayalam schools receive grants-in-aid from Government, as also do numerous primary schools for boys. Female education has not as yet engaged State attention. Of the total population of 600,278, the Census disclosed 26,621 as being able to read and write; of these, 1133 were women. The postal department, which is modelled on that of British India, carried during 1870-71 about 17,300 letters, 950 newspapers, and 17 books, exclusive of all covers on public service. There are no municipalities. In regard to jurisdiction over European British subjects, the R\u00e1j\u00e1, with the approval of the Madras Government, appoints two or three gentlemen\u2014being European British subjects and Christians\u2014to exercise the same jurisdiction as may be exercised in British territory by European British subjects who are magistrates of the first class and justices of the peace. From the sentences of these magistrates there is an appeal to the European judge of the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s chief court, who is also a justice of the peace; and in both original and appeal cases, it is open to the British Resident to advise the Cochin Government to mitigate or remit the sentence. The gentlemen, selected as above by the R\u00e1j\u00e1, have been appointed by the Governor-General in Council to be Justices of the Peace, with a view to their remitting serious cases either to the Resident, who under the authority of the Government of India has the powers ad hoc of a sessions judge, or to the High Court of Madras, in accordance with the rules prescribed by sec. 75 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Cochin are Hindus of pure Kshatriya caste, and claim to be descended from the last of the potentates who held supreme authority over the whole extent of territory stretching from Gokuru in North K\u00e1nara to Cape Comorin. The present R\u00e1j\u00e1, R\u00e1ma Varma, was born in 1835, and succeeded to the throne in 1864. He was created Knight Commander of the Star of India in 1871, and is entitled to a salute of 17 guns. He holds a sanad authorizing adoption; the succession devolves on the eldest male member of the family, if any, according to the Malab\u00e1r law. The military force consists of 326 men and 2 guns.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate, though very damp, is not particularly unhealthy. The average annual rainfall is 107.66 inches, of which 82.10 inches fall during the monsoon, which lasts through the months of May, June, July, and August. The mean annual tempera-\nture is $79^\\circ 7'$ F., and is very uniform throughout the year, only varying from a monthly average of $77^\\circ 7'$ in January to $83^\\circ 4'$ in April, which is the dry season. Even during the latter, though called dry, the air is moist, and frequent showers of rain reduce the temperature, so that a continued drought is unknown. Among endemic diseases, elephantiasis, leprosy, and skin diseases are specially frequent, and malarious fevers prevail all the year round. The elephantiasis is attributed to the impure water used along the coast, where it is most prevalent. Small-pox was annually epidemic from 1865 to 1868; and in 1873, an outbreak of special virulence occurred, 30 per cent. of the cases proving fatal. Cholera appeared in 1865, and again in 1875\u20131876, causing, however, no great loss of life. Native practice is chiefly guided by two Sanskrit works, the *Ashtanghirtayom* and the *Chintarmai*, the mode of treatment being remarkable for the extensive use of medicated oils.

Maclean, Esq., C.S. (Madras, 1879). Also *Administration Report of the Madras Presidency* for 1881\u201382.]\n\n**Cochin.**\u2014One of the seven Sub-divisions of the Native State of Cochin, Madras Presidency. Chief towns\u2014Cochin (1875) population 13,775, Trichur (1881, 10,094), Kam balangi (1875, 6369), and Char\u00e1i (1875, 5051); other large villages, with their population in 1881, are the following:\u2014Narakal (4254), Pall\u00farthi (3912), M\u00e1lankuzi (3033), Edavanakad (3377), Edakuchi (2104), Andikadava (1984), Challanam (2532), Ochanthurti (2280), Azhikal (1725), Elangunapoya (3076), Nairambolam (3161), and Wadakanpura (2013). The gold and silver work and the wood and ivory carving of this Sub-division have more than a local reputation.\n\n**Cochin.**\u2014Native town in the Cochin Sub-division of the Native State of Cochin, Madras Presidency. It consists of 4 conjoined villages, containing 2626 houses, with (1875) 13,775 inhabitants; situated in lat. $9^\\circ 58' 7''$ N., and long. $76^\\circ 17' E.$, on the Travancore estuary half a mile south of the British town of Cochin, in the midst of the populous tract lying between the backwater and the sea. It is connected by canals with Trich\u00far. Cochin was formerly the capital of the State; and near it tradition places the gold reefs said to have been once worked, but certainly not auriferous now.

Area, 2 square miles or 1280 acres, containing 3436 houses; population (1881) 21,360. Surrounded by the Native State of Cochin, but subject\nto the British District of Malab\u00e1r. Land revenue (1882\u201383), \u00a31717. Chief towns\u2014Cochin (infra), Anjengo, and Tangacheri.\n\nCochin (or Kochchi-bandar, \u2018small port\u2019).\u2014Town and head-quarters of the Cochin taluk, Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 9\u00b0 58\u2032 7\u2033 N., long. 76\u00b0 17\u2032 E. Houses, 2878. Population (1881) 15,698, namely, 4383 Hindus, 2942 Muhammadans, 8360 Christians, and 13 \u2018others.\u2019 Area of the municipality, 597 acres, completely built over; revenue for 1875\u201376, \u00a31812; incidence of municipal taxation, about 11d. per head. Situated on the south bank of the principal navigable entrance to the great Travancore estuary, along which the town extends for a mile, and then joins Mattancheri and the Jews\u2019 settlement. Facing Cochin to the north lies the island of Vyp\u00edn, colonized by Eurasian Roman Catholics. The date at which this island was formed by the action of the sea and river, A.D. 1341, is sometimes used in deeds as the commencement of an era styled Puttuv\u00e9ppu (new deposit). As the head-quarters of a subordinate revenue and judicial establishment, Cochin contains the usual courts, jail, and public offices; also a custom house, Master Attendant\u2019s office, post and telegraph offices, dispensary, travellers\u2019 bungalow, and numerous schools, supported either by the various missions established here or by the municipality. The many quaint old Dutch buildings give a picturesque appearance to the town. The exports of Cochin in 1880\u201381 were valued at \u00a3658,878, one-seventh dutiable; and the imports at \u00a3454,954, of which about 4 per cent. paid duty. The port dues collected during the year amounted to \u00a32625.\n\nHistory.\u2014Cochin was one of the first spots in India visited by Europeans. Tradition, indeed, asserts that St. Thomas the apostle extended his labours to this region in 52 A.D., leaving behind him the colony of Christians now called Nassar\u00e1ni M\u00e1ppil\u00e1s (Moplas). It is further said that, in the first year of the Christian era, the Jews settled on the site of their present colony. Afterwards they established their head-quarters at Krangan\u00far (Kodungal\u00far), where they remained until driven away in the 16th century by the Zamorin\u2019s M\u00e1ppil\u00e1s. From copper plates still extant, it is put beyond doubt that the Jewish and Syrian churches were firmly established in Cochin by the 8th century. The modern history of the port is full of interest. In 1500, the Portuguese adventurer, Cabral, after having cannonaded Calicut, landed at this place and met with a friendly reception from the R\u00e1j\u00e1, who is described as a reluctant vassal of the Zamorin. Cabral returned to Portugal with a cargo of pepper, and was followed by Inan de Nova Castelho. In 1502, Vasco da Gama, on his second voyage, came to Cochin and established a factory. In 1503, Albuquerque, the Portuguese admiral, arrived just in time to succour the Cochin R\u00e1j\u00e1, who was besieged by the Zamorin in the island of Vyp\u00edn. He built the Cochin fort called\n'Mannel Kolati,' the first European fort in India, just five years after Da Gama had arrived on the Malabar coast. The fort was enlarged in 1525 by Menezes, the second Viceroy. Albuquerque returned to Portugal, leaving Cochin guarded by only a few hundred men under Duarte Pacheco, when the Zamorin with a large host invaded the country by land and sea. Pacheco with his brave band of 400 men firmly resisted all the attacks of the Zamorin, and at last forced him to retreat to Calicut. In 1505, Francisco Almeyda, the first Portuguese Viceroy of India, came to Cochin with a large fleet, and was in 1510 succeeded by Albuquerque. On Christmas day 1524, Da Gama died here, and was buried, according to Correa, whose narrative is the most trustworthy, in the principal chapel of the Franciscan monastery, now used as the Protestant church. His body was afterwards (1538) removed to Portugal. In 1530, St. Francis Xavier, the apostle of the Indies, preached in these parts and made many converts. In 1557, the church of Santa Cruz was consecrated as the cathedral of a bishop. In 1577, the Society of Jesus published at Cochin the first book printed in India. In 1585, Cochin appears to have been visited by the English traveller Ralph Fitch, who, with a band of adventurers, came by the way of Aleppo, Bagdad, and the Persian Gulf to India. In 1616, the English, under Keeling, engaged to assist the Zamorin in attacking Cochin, on the understanding that an English factory was to be established there. These relations were, however, broken off, and the factory was built some years later with the consent of the Portuguese.\n\nIn 1663, the town and fort were captured from the Portuguese by the Dutch, and the English retired to Pon\u00e1ni. The Dutch greatly improved the place and its trade, building substantial houses after the European fashion, and erecting quays, etc. They also converted the cathedral into a warehouse, and the other Roman Catholic churches were used as Protestant places of worship. In 1778, Adrien Van Moens completely altered the fort, providing it with new ditches, and building seven strong bastions. On the conquest of Holland by the French, orders were received from the English Court of Directors in 1795 to take possession of all the Dutch colonies. As the Dutch governor Vanspall demurred to surrendering Cochin peacefully, it was besieged and captured by Major Petrie (20th October 1795). In 1806, the English blew up the cathedral, destroying at the same time some of the quays, the best houses in the place, and the fort. In 1814, Cochin was formally ceded to the English by treaty.\n\nThe Protestant church (formerly the principal chapel of the Franciscan monastery, and probably dedicated to St. Anthony), which escaped the general destruction above referred to, is a plain massive building, with a nave 142 feet long by 51 broad. Its exact age is unknown; but from inscriptions on the floor, it certainly existed before\n1546, and is therefore the oldest European church in India, except perhaps the Calicut church. It contains some curious old epitaphs. One of these tombstones is sometimes pointed out as that of Vasco da Gama, because it has the word 'Vasco' on it, the rest of the name being obliterated, but the coat of arms above is certainly not that of Da Gama. The fa\u00e7ade of the church was surmounted by an ornamented bronze cross and a weathercock, 6 feet high, which could be distinctly perceived some 10 miles off at sea; but in 1865 these were pulled down. Nearly all traces of the old fort have now disappeared. The building occupied as court-house and taluk 'cutcherry' was formerly the Roman Catholic convent. Among the other principal buildings may be mentioned the jail, marine office, travellers' bungalow, churches, and schools. The custom-house is situated on the boundary limits of British and Native Cochin. The chief native quarters are\u2014Calvetti Baz\u00e1r, thickly populated by M\u00e1ppil\u00e1s (Moplas), which narrowly escaped destruction by fire on New Year's day 1876; and Amarawadi, inhabited by Chetties and goldsmiths. The lighthouse is situated on the ruins of the ramparts, and adjoining it are the bungalows of European residents facing the sea. Of late years, the sea has threatened to encroach on the place; but several stone groins have been thrown out at right angles to the river bank, and the foreshore has been reclaimed.\n\nCocos, The.\u2014Two islands in the Bay of Bengal, situated between lat. 14\u00b0 4' and 14\u00b0 10' N., and in long. 93\u00b0 21' E.; 45 miles north of the Great Andaman, and a short distance south of Table Island, on which there is a good lighthouse, showing a fixed light visible 22 miles in clear weather, and having an elevation of 195 feet above sea-level. The larger and more northerly of the two, called the Great Coco, is a low oblong-shaped island, between 6 and 7 miles in length and 2 miles broad; area, about 14 square miles. The smaller island, or Little Coco, lying about 3 leagues to the south-west of the Great Coco, is 2\u00bd miles long and about a mile broad. Both islands are to a great extent protected by the Andamans from the heavy south-west swell of the Bay of Bengal; but more or less boisterous weather prevails in October and May, when the north-west and south-west monsoons set in. The Great Coco is surrounded by a strip of white coral beach, on which grows an almost continuous fence of cocoa-nut trees. A ship may anchor on the east side of the Great Coco in from 14 to 20 fathoms; also on the west side in the north-east monsoon. Viewed from a distance, the island appears to be entirely covered with these palms (to which it doubtless owes its name); but in reality they form only a narrow belt, the interior being covered with forest trees. One or two parallel ridges, running north and south through the centre of the island, rise to a height not exceeding 50 feet. The island appears\n(from a careful examination made in 1874) to be destitute of drinking water; although it has been said that a good tank exists somewhere. A few wild pigs are found, and there are many birds. The meteorological aspects of the islands do not differ from those of the Andamans. It is on record that a party of 3 Europeans, 1 East Indian, and 8 Burmese tried to effect a settlement on the Great Coco in 1849; but the project had to be abandoned, 7 of the party having succumbed to fever shortly after they landed. In 1878, the Governor-General invited tenders for a fifty years' lease of the Great Coco, which has subsequently been rented to a European gentleman, and placed under the jurisdiction of the Chief Commissioner of British Burma.\n\nCoimbatore (Koyambat\u00far).\u2014District in the Madras Presidency, lying between 10\u00b0 14' and 12\u00b0 19' N. lat., and 76\u00b0 35' and 78\u00b0 14' E. long. Area, 7842 square miles. Population in 1881, 1,657,690. Bounded on the north and north-west by the State of Mysore; on the east by Salem and Trichinopoli Districts, the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) river marking the boundary up to the line of railway; on the west by the Nilgiris, Malab\u00e1r District, and the State of Cochin; and on the south by the District of Madura and the State of Travancore. Coimbatore in point of size ranks seventh, and in point of population tenth, among the Districts of the Madras Presidency. It is sub-divided into 10 taluks, and contains 1447 inhabited villages, including 10 towns. The chief town and administrative head-quarters of the District is Coimbatore. Land revenue (1881\u201382), \u00a3280,969; total revenue, \u00a3328,310.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The northern portion of the District consists of an elevated table-land, divided from the Mysore plateau (of which it really forms a continuation) by the Biligiri-rangan and other hill ranges. It has a northerly slope, and presents throughout an undulating surface, with an average elevation of 2500 feet above the rest of the District. The Biligiri-rangan Hills form a double range, with ridges 5000 feet in height, enclosing a valley 4000 feet above the sea, filled with heavy forest and high grass, a favourite resort of wild elephants. Two passes, the Hassan\u00far and Burgh\u00far gh\u00e1ts, lead thence into the 'low country.' This is a plain, slightly undulating, with an easterly slope from the town of Coimbatore (1431 feet above the sea) to Kar\u00far (380 feet). All the rivers, therefore, flow eastward to join the K\u00e1veri, except in the Poll\u00e1chi taluk, which is situated on the western slope of the watershed. On the western confines of the District lie the Nilgiri Hills, the most conspicuous point being Lambton's Peak, a narrow ridge 5000 feet in height; while on the southern frontier lie the Anamala\u00eds. Along the northern boundary flows the K\u00e1veri, the chief river of Coimbatore, which receives in this District the waters of the Bhavani, Novil, and Amravati. Being confined within rocky\nbanks, and having a fall of 1000 feet in 120 miles, the K\u00e1veri is very rapid. An area of 3000 square miles is covered with forests, which afford a large supply of valuable timber\u2014teak, rosewood, sandalwood, etc. Waste pasture lands constitute a large portion of the Colleg\u00e1l t\u00e1luk; and hither immense herds of cattle are yearly driven from the neighbouring District of Salem to graze. The Lamb\u00e1d\u00ed and Brinj\u00e1r\u00e1s here breed their pack-bullocks. The chief mineral products of the District are iron and limestone; the latter, found everywhere in the nodular form of kankar, exists near the town of Coimbatore in a crystalline form, which is quarried for building purposes. In a District so abundantly supplied with forest, waste land, and hills, it is natural that the fauna should be numerous. Nearly all the larger animals of India are found here\u2014elephant, bison, bear, tiger, leopard, ibex, antelope, deer of several species, hy\u00e6na, boar, wolf, etc.; as also the representative birds of every order. In the rivers, the m\u00e1hser fish is common, running to a great size. Reptiles abound, and about 100 deaths from snake-bite are reported annually. The yearly expenditure in rewards for the destruction of dangerous animals averages \u00a3200.\n\nHistory.\u2014The District of Coimbatore formed part of the kingdom of Chera, in the great Dravida division of Southern India. Its ancient name appears to have been Konga or Kangiyam, which still survives in the town of that name in the D\u00e1rapuram t\u00e1luk. The early kingdom of Chera corresponded roughly with the present Districts of Coimbatore and \u2018Salem below-gh\u00e1ts,\u2019 and had for its capital a city near the site of the present Kar\u00far. About the 9th century, the Chera country was conquered by the Chola dynasty; and two centuries later, both together were merged, with the P\u00e1ndya dominions, into one kingdom. The eastern portion of Coimbatore passed nominally into the hands of the Mad\u00fara N\u00e1iks in the 16th century; and in the 17th century commenced the series of Mysore incursions which terminated in the 18th century in the incorporation of the District with Mysore. In 1653, the first invaders, descending by the Gazalhatti Pass, ravaged the rich plains of Satyamangalam, and penetrated across the District into Mad\u00fara. Thence they were driven back by the generals of Tirum\u00e1la N\u00e1ik through the passes into Mysore. Fourteen years later they returned, capturing Erode and D\u00e1rapuram, and virtually subduing the District. During the wars of Haidar Al\u00ed and his son Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, Coimbatore divided with the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l and Trichinopoli the distinction of being the scene of the hardest fighting. When Haidar rose in the service of the Mysore R\u00e1j\u00e1, and exacted concessions of land for himself, Coimbatore was the first tract assigned to him. He lost it by the temporary reverses of 1760\u201361, but immediately employed his recovered strength to regain possession. In 1768, the British troops occupied the District; but Haidar soon rallied, recaptured it, and carried into\ncaptivity all the weak garrisons that had been left scattered over the country. In 1783, when Tip\u00fa was besieging Mangalore, a diversion was made by a British contingent into Coimbatore; and Kar\u00far, Aravakurichi, and D\u00e1r\u00e1puram were taken in succession. The fort of Coimbatore next fell; but the treaty of Mangalore, signed immediately afterwards, restored the District to Mysore. During the second war with Tip\u00fa, in 1790, a British force again advanced upon the District; and though it was overrun, Tip\u00fa, descending in force, soon reoccupied all the forts. A severe battle fought near D\u00e1r\u00e1puram left him, though not victorious, in virtual possession. In 1791, while Lord Cornwallis was invading Mysore, Tip\u00fa laid siege to the town of Coimbatore; and though it was gallantly defended for five months (by Lieutenants Chalmers and Nash), the garrison were at length obliged to capitulate, and were carried prisoners to Seringapatam. The treaty of 1792, signed soon afterwards, ceded Coimbatore and the greater portion of the District to the English; and in 1799, on the capture of Seringapatam and death of Tip\u00fa, the whole passed under the direct administration of the East India Company. The southern part of the District was then added to the Dindigal Collectorate, and the remainder, with part of Salem District, erected into a separate charge. A rough survey was carried out; and on the lines then laid down, the administration of the District has ever since peaceably progressed. The Jesuit mission at Coimbatore has lately been erected into a separate Vicariate-Apostolic, with jurisdiction over the Nilgiris and parts of Malab\u00e1r and Cochin. The London, Leipzig, Lutheran, and Evangelical missions have all settlements in the District.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1871 disclosed a total population of 1,763,274 persons, inhabiting 361,109 houses. The latest Census, that of 1881, returned a total population of 1,657,690, showing a decrease of 105,584, or very nearly 6 per cent., in the decade, due to the severe famine of 1876\u201378. Coimbatore was one of the 'famine Districts' of that disastrous time, but the distress was not equally intense over the whole District. In the taluks of Coimbatore, Kar\u00far, and Pollachi, the number of the population has even increased. The male population of the District in 1881 numbered 806,859, and the female 850,831; proportion of males, 48\u00b76 per cent. Average density of population, 211 persons per square mile, as compared with 225 in 1871; number of towns and villages, 1447; number of occupied houses, 354,920; number of villages per square mile, '18; occupied houses per square mile, 45; inmates per house, 4\u00b76. As regards the religious distinctions of the people, 1,606,343, or 96\u00b79 per cent., were returned as Hindus; 37,855, or 2 per cent., as Muhammadans; 13,326, or 0\u00b79 per cent., as Christians; there were also 63 Buddhists, 68 Jains, 4 P\u00e1rs\u00eds, and 31 'others.' Of\nchildren under ten years of age there were 218,372 males and 228,438 females. Among the Christians, 87 per cent. of whom are Roman Catholics, are included 274 Europeans and 272 Eurasians. The Hindu population was distributed as follows: \u2014 Br\u00e1hmans, 29,792; Kshatriyas, 3039; Chetties (traders), 55,136; Vall\u00e1lars (agriculturists), 690,402; Id\u00e1iyars (shepherds), 42,432; Kam\u00e1lars (artisans), 43,458; Kanakkans (writers), 1062; Kaikalars (weavers), 81,641; Vanniyans (labourers), 107,480; Kushavans (potters), 16,394; Sat\u00e1n\u00eds (mixed castes), 66,068; Shembadavans (fishermen), 25,004; Sh\u00e1n\u00e1ns (toddy-drawers), 55,517; Ambattans (barbers), 20,062; Vann\u00e1ns (washermen), 23,317; Pariahs, 216,270; \u2018others,\u2019 129,269. According to occupation, 18,591, or 1\u201912 per cent. of the total population, are professional; 14,408, or 0\u201987 per cent., domestic; 12,943, or 0\u201978 per cent., commercial; 629,514, or 37\u201997 per cent., agricultural; 251,883, or 15\u201920 per cent., industrial; and 730,351, or 44\u201906 per cent., indefinite and non-productive. 3\u201912 per cent. among the last are returned as \u2018occupied.\u2019 About 59 per cent. are returned as workers, on whom the remaining 41 per cent. of the population depend. Of males 67\u201941 per cent., and of females 51\u201913 per cent., are workers. There are educated or under instruction 89,909 persons, or 83,202 males and 6707 females, the percentage being 10\u201931 and 0\u201979 respectively. The hill and jungle tribes are the Malasers, Irulers, Paliars, Kaders, and Madavars, found chiefly in the Anamalais, who subsist precariously on wild fruits and roots, by the chase, or the sale of jungle produce. The Muhammadans were divided, according to sect, into 4470 Labhays, 1889 Shaikhs, 2027 Path\u00e1ns, and 6602 Sayyids. The M\u00e1ppil\u00e1s, Arabs, and Mughals number together only 122, while 14,758 were returned as \u2018others,\u2019 and 7987 as \u2018not stated.\u2019 The language of the northern portion of the District is Kanarese, that of the remainder Tamil; but in many villages a corrupt Telugu prevails, bearing witness to the northern origin of the inhabitants. The chief towns are\u2014COIMBATORE (population 38,967), ERODE (9864), and KARUR (9205), the three municipalities of the District; BHAVANI (5930), COLLEGAL (8462), DARAPURAM (7310), POLLACHI (5082), PALLAPATTI (6351), SATYAMANGALAM (3210), and Udamalpet (5061). The agriculturists of the Vall\u00e1lar caste and, day-labourers are all poor, living in mud-walled huts, and subsisting on cholam, ragi, and kambu, the staple food-grains of the District. Rice is eaten only by the well-to-do. The expenses of an ordinary shopkeeper, with a household of five persons, have been estimated at about \u00a33 per month, and of a cultivator\u2019s family at about one-half that sum.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of the District, 7842 square miles (5,018,880 acres), 3,469,331 acres were returned in 1881-82 as assessed to Government revenue. The total area under cultivation\namounted to 2,100,393 acres, of which 115,072 acres were irrigated. The cultivable area not under the plough was 1,100,869 acres; pasture and forest lands, 481,265 acres; and uncultivable waste, 617,363 acres; total uncultivated, 2,099,497 acres. Of the total area, 324,511 acres are held in in\u00e1m, or under a free grant. In the course of 1881-82, a regular survey and settlement of great part of Coimbatore took place. The staple crops of the District are\u2014cholam (Sorghum vulgare) and kambu (Panicum spicatum), which occupied 519,775 and 657,555 acres respectively of the cultivated area; ragi (Eleusine coracana), 212,265 acres; gram (Dolichos biflorus), 63,409 acres; rice, 85,717 acres; and other cereals, 35,968 acres. Rice requires heavy irrigation, and its cultivation is not increasing. Other crops, as d\u00e1l (Cajanus indicus), \u00faland\u00fa (Phaseolus mungo), peas, lentils, and other pulses occupied 199,357 acres; orchard and garden produce, as plantains, coconuts, etc., 8184 acres; tobacco, 17,396 acres; coffee, 258 acres; condiments and spices, 16,581 acres; potatoes, 2128 acres; sugar-cane and sugar palm, 5777 acres; oil-seeds, 46,090 acres; cotton, 229,631 acres; and flax, 302 acres. The agricultural stock of the District in 1881-82 comprised 531,725 horned cattle, 14,583 donkeys, 2363 ponies, 350 horses, 245,653 goats, 354,154 sheep, 10,908 pigs, 16,866 carts, and 166,770 ploughs. The prices of produce ruling in the District at the end of the year 1881-82, per maund of 80 lbs., were for rice, 5s. 1\u00bdd.; for wheat, 6s. 9\u00bed.; other grains, from 2s. 3d. to 2s. 10d.; gram, from 2s. 7\u00bdd. to 5s. 5\u00bdd.; chillies, 7s.; salt, 6s. 7\u00bdd.; sugar, 11s. 5\u00bcd.; gingelly, 7s. 3\u00bed.; ground nuts, 3s. 2\u00bcd.; tobacco, 11s. 9\u00bed.; flax, 10s.; cotton, 7s. 7\u00bdd.; sheep, 4s. 6d. each. There are two seasons for sowing, May and October, and two harvests, in September and February. Rice land pays from 15s. to \u00a32, 12s. in land revenue per acre, and produces a crop ranging in value, according to the quality of the soil, from \u00a32, 8s. to \u00a35, 6s. Most land also yields a second crop, valued at about half the first. The majority of the holdings are very small; and the average of the revenue assessment is about 16s. A holding paying \u00a350 a year to Government is considered an exceptionally large one, and one paying \u00a310 a comfortable estate. The holder of an estate paying less than \u00a32 would be considered poor. With a single pair of oxen, 5 acres can be cultivated; the necessary implements and oxen would cost about \u00a35; and if the plot were garden land, the cultivator would be about as well off as a retail shopkeeper making 16s. a month. Most of the cultivators have occupancy rights; but many villages are held zamind\u00e1ri, as one estate, the proprietor paying a fixed yearly revenue (peshkash) to Government, and recouping himself from his tenants. Other villages and plots, again, are held as j\u00e1girs, shrotriem, or in\u00e1m, rent free, and on specially advantageous\nterms, in reward for services rendered, or for the support of religious and charitable endowments. Under the Mysore rule, the District was farmed by a few wealthy individuals, who made themselves responsible for the revenue; but in 1800, after the last Mysore war, when the Company assumed the administration, the present system of direct settlement with the cultivators was introduced. Waste lands, overgrown with cactus, the scourge of part of the District, are leased rent free, for terms not exceeding ten years, to any who will rid them of the pest, and bring them under cultivation. The principle of rotation of crops appears to be thoroughly understood, and the advantages of manure are appreciated. The 'Imperial' and 'Minor' irrigation works of the District comprise 59 channels and 119 tanks, irrigating an area of 55,276 acres, and yielding a revenue of \u00a329,365. Agricultural day-labourers or coolies earn 4\u00bdd. per diem; women, 3d.; and children, 1\u00bdd. Blacksmiths, bricklayers, and carpenters receive from 1s. to 1s. 9d. per diem. Since 1850, the rates of wages for skilled labour have risen from 25 to 80 per cent., and prices of food have doubled. Rice, which in 1850 was selling at 3s. per maund (80 lbs.), now sells at 5s. 6d.; cholam, formerly 1s. 4d. per maund, now costs 3s.; wheat, once 3s. per maund, now sells at 7s.; salt has risen from 4s. 4d. to 6s. 7\u00bdd. per maund, and country liquor from 1\u00bdd. to 3d. and 8d. per gallon. Accumulations of money from the profits of agriculture are to a large extent employed in well-building and the improvement of land. The rate of interest varies from 6 to 12 per cent. per annum, though 24 to 30 per cent. is sometimes charged; 9 per cent. is considered a good return for money invested in land.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Periods of drought and consequently high prices have recurred at regular intervals, in 1837\u201338, 1847\u201348, 1857\u201358, 1868\u201369; but in none of these years did the scarcity ever amount to famine. In 1876, owing to the failure of crops in Mysore and the Ceded Districts, an immense exportation of grain from Coimbatore took place; the result being such a rapid rise in the rates, that in two months the price of cholam had doubled, and ragi, selling in October at 25 lbs. for 1s., cost in December three times that amount. Actual famine afterwards set in; and relief works had to be opened, which in a month gave employment to 28,000 persons. A steady importation of sea-borne grain soon brought prices to their normal rates. Against famine Coimbatore has now the best safeguard\u2014a railway traversing it, and good roads communicating with the Districts adjoining on all sides.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014Weaving is the chief industry of the District, and, though of late years affected by the low price of British textures, constitutes a lucrative employment. The general export trade is small, consisting chiefly in the exchange of cotton of inferior quality, tobacco,\nand grain, for salt. Palladam is the centre of the cotton trade, the fibre being there pressed, and despatched to the railway station of Tirup\u00far for transmission to the ports of Madras and Beypur. Weekly markets held at the towns and larger villages\u2014about 250 in all\u2014provide amply for local interchange of produce. The total length of railway lines running through the District is 147 miles, viz. the Madras Railway, south-west line, with a branch to the Nilgiri Hills from Podan\u00far junction station to Mettapolliem, and the South Indian Railway passing through Kar\u00far, and joining the Madras line at Erode station. There are also 1514 miles of made Imperial and Local roads. The principal roads are the Madras Trunk Road and those leading to Trichinopoli, Madura, and the Burgh\u00far and Hassan\u00far Passes, aggregating a total length of 385 miles. Khedas, or stockades, for the capture of wild elephants have been established in the north of the District. In 1873, an Act was passed forbidding the destruction of these animals; and since that year several scores of elephants have been captured alive.\n\nAdministration.\u2014For administrative purposes, the District is divided into 10 taluks\u2014Coimbatore, Pollachi, Palladam, Karur, Erode, Udamalpet, Darapuram, Satyamangalam, Collegal, and Bhavani\u2014each of which is supervised by a native staff, revenue and judicial. The Sub-Collector, Head Assistant (Europeans), and Deputy Collector have superior jurisdiction; the first over 4, the second over 3, and the third over 2 taluks, the Collector-Magistrate having himself special charge of the head-quarters taluk. The Nilgiri Hills formed, until 1868, a Subdivision of Coimbatore. The total revenue for 1881\u201382 was \u00a3328,310. The principal items of income were\u2014land revenue, \u00a3280,969; excise, \u00a325,973; stamps, \u00a320,107; forests, \u00a34623; and assessed taxes, \u00a31258. The judicial machinery of the District consists of 6 civil courts and 32 magisterial courts, exclusive of village magistrates. The police force aggregates a strength of 1211 of all ranks, being in the proportion of 1 constable to every 6 square miles and to every 1369 of the population, maintained at an annual cost of \u00a319,563. The District contains 1 central, 1 District, and 16 subsidiary jails. The central jail accommodates upwards of 1000 prisoners. The daily average number of prisoners in it and in the District jail was, in 1881, 1185; in all the others together, 91. The total expenditure on this account for 1881 amounted to \u00a37165, or \u00a36, 18s. per head, for the prisoners in the central jail; and \u00a3881, or \u00a35, 15s. per head, for those in the District jail.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Coimbatore is remarkable for the comparatively cool winds which blow across it from the west between May and October. The monsoon brings its rain to Malab\u00e1r, and up to the range of hills separating that District from Coimbatore; but there it stops, a cold damp wind without any rain blowing during the monsoon months over the plains of Coimbatore. Thus, after the hot months of March and\nApril, the temperature suddenly falls, and remains low till October. The District is healthy, except at the foot of the hill ranges, where the atmosphere at night is so malarious that the cultivators dare not remain after dusk. The number of births registered in the District in 1881 was 35,038, or a ratio of 21.1 births per 1000 of population. The number of registered deaths for the same year was 20,805, or 12.5 per 1000, the mean for the previous five years being 15.2. The extension of cultivation having greatly curtailed the pasturage, murrain and 'foot-and-mouth' disease have become prevalent among the cattle. The latter disease has been communicated to the wild herds of bison, and sportsmen find the numbers of these animals rapidly decreasing from this cause. [For further information regarding Coimbatore, see the Madras Census Report for 1881, and the Annual Administration Reports of the Presidency from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nCoimbatore.\u2014Taluk of Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency. Area, 864 square miles, of which about 56 per cent. is under cultivation. The taluk contains 1 town and 261 villages, and 51,761 occupied houses. Population (1881) 267,804, namely, 131,334 males and 136,470 females; land revenue demand, \u00a333,870. There are in the taluk 2 civil and 4 criminal courts; police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 10; strength of police, 349 men.\n\nCoimbatore (Koyamb\u00e1t\u00far, formerly Koyampadi and Koibmutur).\u2014Chief town and administrative head-quarters of Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency. A station of the Madras Railway situated on the left bank of the Noyil river, in lat. 10\u00b0 59' 41\" N., and long. 76\u00b0 59' 46\" E.; 304 miles by rail from Madras, and 50 miles from Ut\u00e1kamand (Ootacamund). Houses, 6684, of which 1007 were unoccupied in 1881; two-thirds of the houses are tiled. Population (1881) 38,967, namely, 33,997 Hindus, 2763 Muhammadans, 2162 Christians, and 45 'others;' municipal revenue in 1881-82, \u00a32651; incidence of taxation per head, about 1s. 4\u00bdd. As the head-quarters of the District administration, Coimbatore contains all the chief courts\u2014magisterial, revenue, and judicial\u2014the central jail, District police, post and telegraph offices, dispensary, and school. The town lies 1437 feet above sea-level; and, being built with particularly wide streets, and possessing good natural drainage, an abundant water-supply, and a cool temperature, it is better suited for the residence of Europeans than most of the towns of the Presidency. The Nilgiri branch of the Madras south-western line connects it with the railway system\u2014the junction station for Coimbatore being Podan\u00far. From its position, commanding the approach to Palgh\u00e1t on the west, and to the Gazalhatti Pass on the north, Coimbatore was formerly of great strategical importance. Originally belonging to the Chera dominions, it fell to the Mad\u00fara N\u00e1yaks, by whom it was considered one of their chief strongholds, and afterwards\nto Mysore. During the wars with Haidar Al\u00ed and Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, it changed masters many times. In 1768, the British took it, and again lost it; and in 1783, it was again taken and retaken. In 1790, the Company's forces a third time occupied it, but Tip\u00fa, after a siege of five months, compelled the garrison to surrender. In 1792 provisionally, and in 1799 finally, the town was ceded to the British, and from that time it ceased to be a military station. Three miles distant, at Per\u00far, stands the temple of Mel-Chidambaram (to be distinguished from the Kil-Chidambaram of South Arcot), celebrated for its sanctity, and further remarkable as one of the three Hindu temples spared from destruction by Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n.\n\n**Col\u00e1ba.**\u2014District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Kolaba.\n\n**Colepett.**\u2014Town in Coorg.\u2014See Amatti.\n\n**Coleroon** *(Kolladam).*\u2014The northern mouth of the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) river in the Madras Presidency, which leaves the main channel at the upper end of the island of Srirangam, about 10 miles west of Trichinopoli, in lat. $10^\\circ 53'$ N., and long. $78^\\circ 51'$ E. After a north-easterly course of about 94 miles, it falls into the Bay of Bengal at Atchavaram, $\\frac{3}{2}$ miles from Porto Novo, in lat. $11^\\circ 26'$ N., and long. $79^\\circ 52'$ E. For the greater part of its length the Coleroon forms the boundary between the Districts of Trichinopoli and South Arcot on the left, and Tanjore on the right bank. As compared with the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) proper, its course is more direct and its fall more rapid; and consequently it naturally tends to carry off the larger volume of water. To counteract this tendency and maintain the proper water-supply of the Tanjore delta, the great anicut or dam was constructed in 1856 across the channel of the Coleroon by Sir A. Cotton. A description of this work is given in the article on the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery). In the same year a second dam, known as the lower anicut, was thrown across the Coleroon, 70 miles below Srirangam, in order to regulate the irrigation of South Arcot. This dam consists of a hollow bar of masonry, 8 feet high and as many broad, the interior being filled with sand rammed down. The total length is 1901 feet, and in the rear is an apron of masonry. The lower anicut also feeds the great Viranam tank by the Vadav\u00e1r channel, and by several canals irrigates Tanjore District. In South Arcot, the main channels from the Coleroon are the 'Kh\u00e1n S\u00e1hib,' the 'Iron Company's,' the 'R\u00e1j\u00e1 Vaikal,' the Budenk\u00fagi, and the Karang\u00fali canals. The total outlay on the lower anicut and its dependent works was about \u00a330,000, and the increase of revenue since its construction has averaged over \u00a310,000 per annum in South Arcot alone. The Coleroon is affected by the tide for 5 or 6 miles from its mouth. The boat traffic is considerable.\n\n**Colgong** *(Kahlg\u00e1on).*\u2014Town and head-quarters of a police circle *(th\u00e1na)* in Bh\u00e1galpur District, Bengal; situated on the right or south\nbank of the Ganges. Lat. $25^\\circ 15' 55''$ N., long. $87^\\circ 16' 51''$ E. The second largest town in the District. Population (1881), Hindus, 4419; Muhammadans, 1240; 'others,' 13; total 5672, namely, 2707 males and 2965 females. Municipal committee of 10 members, of whom 9 are non-officials. Municipal income (1881-82), \u00a3319; expenditure, \u00a3321; rate of taxation, 1s. 1\u00bdd. per head of population within municipal limits. Colgong has for long been a place of commercial importance, owing to its being easily accessible both by railway and river, and is still a centre of trade for the country on all sides for about a dozen miles round. Since 1875, however, a large number of traders have left the town in consequence of the diversion of the main stream of the Ganges, which formerly flowed just under the town, but has receded, although there is now (1883) a channel close under the town, which is open for traffic in the dry season. The former channel of the river is at present occupied by a broad bank of loose sand, across which it is very difficult to convey heavy merchandise. The railway station is on the loop line of the East Indian Railway, 245 miles from Calcutta. The only fact of historical interest connected with Colgong is that Mahm\u00fad Sh\u00e1h, the last independent King of Bengal, died here in 1539 A.D. After his defeat at Behar, he fled to Gaur; and when that place was invested by the Afgh\u00e1n Sher Sh\u00e1h, he took refuge with the Emperor Hum\u00e1yun at Chan\u00e1r. In his absence, Gaur was stormed and sacked, and his two sons were slain by the Afgh\u00e1ns. He had advanced with the Emperor as far as Colgong, to attack Sher Sh\u00e1h, when the tidings of his sons' death was brought to him, which so affected him that he died of grief in a few days.\n\n**Collegal** (K\u00e1llig\u00e1l).\u2014T\u00edluk in Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency. Area, 1062 square miles, containing 1 town and 121 villages. Houses, 12,617. Population (1881) 77,522, namely, 37,890 males and 39,632 females. Land revenue demand (1882-83), \u00a38393. The t\u00e1luk contains 1 civil and 2 criminal courts, with 6 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s).\n\n**Collegal** (K\u00e1llig\u00e1l).\u2014Chief town in the t\u00e1luk of the same name, Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency. Lat. $12^\\circ 10' N.$, long. $77^\\circ 9' E.$ Population (1881) 8462, namely, 7951 Hindus, 493 Muhammadans, and 18 Christians; number of houses, 1347.\n\n**Colonelganj**.\u2014Town in Gonda District, Oudh; 2 miles north of the Sarju river, 20 miles from Gonda town, and 10 from Bahramgh\u00e1t. Lat. $27^\\circ 8' N.$, and long. $81^\\circ 44' E.$ The original village, named Sakrora, was a place of no importance till, in 1780, a force under a British officer was sent by the Naw\u00e1b of Oudh to bring to terms the refractory rulers of his trans-Gogra Provinces, and Sakrora became the head-quarters of this force for some years. In 1802, a larger force was stationed here; and a b\u00e1z\u00e1r named Colonelganj, in honour of the com-\nmanding officer, came into existence. On the annexation of Oudh, Colonelganj was selected as the military head-quarters for the Commissionership of Gonda and Bahr\u00e1ich. The native troops here, as elsewhere, revolted on the outbreak of the Mutiny; and it was with difficulty that the English officers escaped to the protection of the loyal R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Balr\u00e1mpur. On the suppression of the rebellion, Colonelganj was abandoned as a military station. Its central position between Bahr\u00e1ich, Gonda, and Balr\u00e1mpur, however, marked it out as a natural d\u00e9p\u00f4t for the rice and oil-seeds of the western portions of the trans-Gogra tar\u00e1i, and it soon became the seat of a flourishing export trade, which has increased of late years, but which is probably doomed to extinction on the completion of the Patn\u00e1-Bahr\u00e1ich railway. Import trade insignificant, consisting of a little salt, raw and manufactured cotton, and copper vessels. Population (1881), Hindus, 4106, the prevailing castes being Bani\u00e1s, P\u00e1s\u00eds, and Ah\u00edrs; Muhammadans, 1789; total, 5904, residing in 1243 houses. A few ordinary Hindu temples, two mosques, and a sard\u00ed, are the principal buildings. Bi-weekly market, police station, Government school, dispensary.\n\n**Colonelganj.**\u2014River-side mart in Patn\u00e1 District, Bengal, situated west of Gulz\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1gh, forming one of the large business quarters of Patn\u00e1 City, and the centre of a large trade in oil-seeds and food-grains.\n\n**Combaconum** (*Kumbhakonam*).\u2014T\u00e1luk or Sub-division in Tanjore District, Madras Presidency. Area, 314 square miles, containing 2 towns and 505 villages. Houses, 61,667. Population (1881) 370,723, namely, 179,538 males and 191,185 females. Land revenue (1882\u201383), \u00a379,718. The t\u00e1luk is administered by a Head Assistant Collector, with tahsild\u00e1rs, who preside over 2 civil and 4 criminal courts; number of police stations (*th\u00e1n\u00e1s*), 12; strength of police force, 182 men.\n\n**Combaconum** (*Kumbhakonam*, \u2018The water-jar mouth\u2019\u2014Sanskrit).\u2014Town and head-quarters of Combaconum t\u00e1luk, Tanjore District, Madras Presidency; situated in the richest tract of the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) delta, in lat. 10\u00b0 58' 20\" N., and long. 79\u00b0 24' 30\" E. Population (1881) 59,998, namely, 47,908 Hindus, of whom nearly 20 per cent. are Br\u00e1hmans, 1228 Muhammadans, 908 Christians, and 54 \u2018others;\u2019 number of houses, 7243. Formerly the capital of the Chola kingdom, it is one of the most ancient and sacred towns in the Presidency, and so celebrated for its learning as to have been called the Oxford of Southern India. In addition to a number of Hindu temples, for the most part in good repair and well endowed, it contains a Government college, courts, etc. Being much frequented by visitors and pilgrims, a brisk trade is carried on. Municipal revenue, about \u00a34100; incidence of direct taxation, about 11d. per head.\n\n**Comercolly.**\u2014Town in Nadiy\u00e1 District, Bengal.\u2014See Kumarkhal\u00ed.\n\n**Comillah** (*Kumill\u00e1*).\u2014Chief town and administrative head-quarters\nof Tipperah District, Bengal; situated on the Gumti river, on the main road from Dacca to Chittagong, in lat. $23^\\circ 27' 55''$ N., and long. $91^\\circ 13' 18''$ E. Population (1881), Hindus, 5850; Muhammadans, 7351; Christians, 121; 'others,' 50: total, 13,372, namely, males 8029, and females 5343. Constituted a municipality in 1864, the municipal limits covering an area of 2969 acres; income in 1881-82, \u00a31692\u2014expenditure, \u00a31649; rate of taxation, 1s. 3\u00bdd. per head of population within municipal limits. During the rains, the water in the river often rises several feet above the level of the town, which is only saved from periodical inundation by an embankment maintained by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Hill Tipperah; but as this is narrow and weak in many parts, the town has sometimes been in great danger. The principal roads are metalled within municipal limits, and lined on both sides with handsome trees. The largest of the many fine tanks in Comillah is the Dharm S\u00e1g\u00e1r, constructed by a R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Tipperah in the first half of the 15th century, which is a mile in circumference. The houses of the European officials, and the District school, are built on its banks. An English church was consecrated by the Bishop of Calcutta in September 1875. Besides the ordinary Government courts and buildings, the houses of the European residents, and the post-office, there are very few brick houses in the place. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Tipperah, who owns the land on which the town is built, will not allow his tenants to build any but mat or mud houses, unless they pay him so large a nazar (conciliatory present) as to practically amount to a prohibition. Bridged unmetalled roads, passable for carts all the year round, connect Comillah with D\u00e1\u00fad Kandi, Chittagong, Company-ganj, the Titas river, Haj\u00edganj, Laksham Bib\u00ed B\u00e1z\u00e1r, and the R\u00e1lmai hills. Comilla has been fixed upon as the starting-point for the projected railway northwards to Assam and Cachar.\n\n**Comorin** (*Kum\u00e1ri*; *Kannia-Kum\u00e1ri*).\u2014Headland in the State of Travancore, Madras Presidency, the extreme southern point of India. Lat. $8^\\circ 4' 20''$ N., long. $77^\\circ 35' 35''$ E. From Cape Comorin the chain of the Western Gh\u00e1ts runs northwards. In the *Periplus*, reference is made to a harbour here; but this has now disappeared, owing to encroachments of the sea, although a well of fresh water in a rock a little way out to sea seems to support the theory of its former existence.\n\n**Comorin** (*Kum\u00e1ri*, 'a virgin').\u2014Village near the cape of the same name. Lat. $8^\\circ 4'$ N., long. $77^\\circ 36'$ E. Houses, 430. Population (1881) 2247. The bathing festival referred to by the Greek geographers is still continued in honour of Durg\u00e1, the virgin goddess after whom the place is named.\n\n**Condavid.**\u2014Town in Kistna District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Kondavir.\nConjevaram (Kanchivaram; Kanchipuram; Kien-chi-pu-lo of Hwen Thsang).\u2014Taluk of Chengalpat District, Madras Presidency. Area, 447 square miles. Houses, 30,411. Population (1881) 185,649, namely, 91,909 males and 93,740 females. In no other taluk in the District are the women in excess of the men. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014176,506 Hindus; 3814 Muhammadans; 5205 Christians, nearly all Roman Catholics; and 124 \u2018others.\u2019 A low-lying taluk, with a stony soil, and only wooded by scrub-jungle. Watered by the Pal\u00e1r and Cortelliar rivers. Land revenue demand, \u00a339,279. The taluk, which is subject in civil matters to the jurisdiction of the munshi\u2019s court at Trivellore, contains 3 criminal courts, with 11 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of police force, 165 men.\n\nConjevaram (Kanchivaram).\u2014Town and head-quarters of Conjevaram taluk, Chengalpat District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 12\u00b0 49' 45\" N., long. 79\u00b0 45' E. Houses, 7179. Population (1881) 37,275, namely, Hindus, 35,989; Muhammadans, 1172; Christians, 28; and \u2018others,\u2019 86. Area of town site, 5858 acres. About 11 per cent. of the population are Br\u00e1hmans, and 17 per cent. weavers of a caste peculiar to this portion of the District. Municipal revenue for 1881\u201382, \u00a32412; incidence of taxation, about 8d. per head of rateable population. Situated on the Trunk road 46 miles south-west of Madras. The branch line of the South Indian Railway from Chengalpat to Arkonam passes through the eastern extremity of the town. As the head-quarters of the taluk, Conjevaram contains the usual subordinate magisterial and revenue courts, jail, dispensary, school, etc. But it is chiefly interesting as being a place of special sanctity. Conjevaram is one of the seven holy cities of India, and has been called the \u2018Benares of the South.\u2019 Hwen Thsang speaks of it as the capital of Dravida. It was then a great Buddhist centre; but about the 8th century began a Jain epoch, and traces of this religion still exist in the neighbourhood. To this succeeded the period of Hindu predominance, and the Vijayanagar R\u00e1j\u00e1s (who had treated the Jains liberally) endowed the sacred places of their own religion with great magnificence. Two of the temples, the largest in Southern India, were built by Krishna Raya about 1509; and for many smaller pagodas, choultries and agrah\u00e1rams (Br\u00e1hman resting-houses and alms-houses), the town is indebted to the same family. The lofty gopuras (pyramids), the thousand-pillared temple, with its splendid porch and fine jewels, attract the chief attention of visitors (see Chidambaram). The great annual fair held in May is attended, in prosperous years, by as many as 50,000 pilgrims. \u2018Kanchipur\u2019 was an important city of the Chola kingdom, and in the 14th century the capital of Tondamandalam. After the fall of the Vijayanagar family in 1644, it was subject to the Muhammadan\nkings of Golconda, and at a later date became part of the Arcot dominions. In 1751, Clive, returning from Arcot, took the town from the French, but had, in the same year, again to contest its possession with R\u00e1j\u00e1 S\u00e1hib. In 1757, the French, beaten off in an attack upon the pagoda, set fire to the town. In 1758, the British garrison was temporarily withdrawn, on account of the expected advance of the French upon Madras, but was soon sent back with reinforcements; and during the siege of the capital, and the subsequent wars of the Karnatic, this town played an important part as a d\u00e9p\u00f4t and cantonment. A few miles distant, at Pullal\u00far, is the battle-field where General Baillie\u2019s column was cut to pieces in 1780 by Haidar Al\u00ed.\n\n**Contai (K\u00e1nthi).**\u2014Sub-division of Midnapur District, Bengal, lying between $21^\\circ 37' 15''$ and $22^\\circ 10' 30''$ N. lat., and between $87^\\circ 27' 15''$ and $88^\\circ 1' 30''$ E. long.

The Sub-division, which was created 1st January 1852, comprises the 6 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) of Contai, Raghun\u00e1thpur, Egra, Khejiri (Kedgeree), Pat\u00e1sipur, and Bhagw\u00e1npur. In 1883, it contained two revenue and two magisterial courts, with a regular police force 158 strong, besides 1352 village watchmen.\n\n**Contai (K\u00e1nthi).**\u2014Head-quarters of Contai Sub-division, Midnapur District, Bengal, and of a police circle (th\u00e1n\u00e1). The village contains the usual sub-divisional buildings, two m\u00fansif\u2019s courts, and a higher-class English school.\n\n**Coompta (Kumpta).**\u2014Sub-division and town, K\u00e1nara District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Kumpta.\n\n**Coonoor (K\u00fanir).**\u2014Town and sanitarium in the Nilgiri Hills District, Madras Presidency. Situated in lat. $11^\\circ 20'$ N., and long. $76^\\circ 50'$ E., 6000 feet above the sea-level, at the south-east corner of the Nilgiri plateau, and at the head of the principal pass (the Coonoor Gh\u00e1t) from the plains; distant 363 miles by rail from Madras, and 12 from Ut\u00e1kamand (Ootacamund). Houses, 1450. Population (1881) about 4778, being 3247 Hindus (chiefly Pariahs), and the remainder Europeans, with their establishments, a fluctuating number. The municipal limits extend over about 7 square miles; the municipal revenue realized in 1881 was about \u00a32000; incidence of taxation, about 2s. 7d. per head of population. A carriage road, 21 miles long, connects Coonoor with the station of Mettapalliem, the terminus of the Nilgiri branch of the Madras (South-Western) Railway; but a Righi railway to Coonoor from the terminal station is about to be constructed.\nCoonor contains a sub-magistrate's court, etc., hospital, four places of worship (1 Roman Catholic, 1 Church of England, and 2 of other denominations), and many schools, a library and shops and hotels for the convenience of Europeans. In the neighbourhood are several tea and coffee estates. Coonor is one of the principal sanitaria of the Presidency, and second only to Ut\u00e1kamand (Ootacamund) in natural advantages. The town is built on the sides of the beautiful basin formed by the expansion of the Jackatalla valley, at the mouth of a great gorge, surrounded by wooded hills. It possesses a cool and equable climate, the mean annual temperature in the shade being $62^\\circ$ F. In the warmer months the thermometer fluctuates between $55^\\circ$ and $75^\\circ$; in the colder months, between $38^\\circ$ and $68^\\circ$. The average annual rainfall is 76 inches, distributed in normal years over 112 days. The rate of mortality is remarkably low, and no particular ailments can be said to be characteristic of the place. The town is well kept, but owing to increase of population, etc., the drainage is in much need of improvement; it has about 20 miles of excellent roads and beautiful pleasure drives, along the sides of which grow hedges and roses, while the fuchsia, dahlia, and heliotrope attain the proportions of shrubs. Altogether, it forms one of the most lovely hill stations in India, and commands magnificent views of mountains, precipices, great stretches of hill forests, and the plains spreading out in a vast expanse of fertility beneath. The European settlement is on the upper plateau; the native quarter on the lower slopes of the valley.\n\n**Coorg** (*Kurg*; *Kodagu*, lit. 'steep mountains').\u2014Territory or Province in Southern India, under the administration of the Supreme Government, through the Mysore Resident, who is also Chief Commissioner of Coorg; situated between $11^\\circ 56'$ and $12^\\circ 50'$ N. lat., and between $75^\\circ 25'$ and $76^\\circ 14'$ E. long. Total area, according to the most recent estimate of the Survey Department, 1583 square miles, the greatest length from north to south being 60, and from west to east 40 miles. Population, according to the Census of 1881, 178,302. The chief town and seat of administration is Merkara, in $75^\\circ 46'$ N. lat., and $12^\\circ 26'$ E. long.; population (1881) 8383, including 2156 returned as being in the cantonment.\n\nCoorg is bounded along its entire western frontier by the mountain chain of the Western Gh\u00e1ts, which separates it from the Madras Districts of Malab\u00e1r and South K\u00e1nara. This range curves somewhat inland, so as to serve also to some extent as the northern and southern boundary. On the north, Coorg is partially separated from the forest highlands of Mysore by the rivers Kum\u00e1radh\u00e1ri and Hemavat\u00ed. On the east it merges in the general table-land of Mysore, the boundary for some distance being marked by the river K\u00e1veri (Cauvery).\n\n**History.**\u2014Coorg has always been known in history as the home of a\nbrave and independent race of mountaineers, who maintained their freedom against the outnumbering forces of Haidar Ali, and only yielded to the British power after a sharp struggle, the English Government conceding to them the maintenance of their civil and religious usages, and respect for their national characteristics. At the present day the native tribe of Coorgs, though only numbering some 27,000 souls, preserve all the marks of a dominant race. They cultivate their hereditary lands on a feudal tenure, bear arms at their pleasure, and treat with British officials through their head-men on terms of honourable equality. No people in India have given more decisive proofs of their loyalty to the British crown.\n\nWhatever may have been the true character of the earlier history of Coorg, the Br\u00e1hmans, on finding their way into the country, enshrouded the current legends and traditions of Coorg in Pur\u00e1nic lore, in the K\u00e1veri Pur\u00e1na, forming an episode of comparatively recent date in four chapters of the Sk\u00e1nda or K\u00e1rtikeya Pur\u00e1na, and glorifying the river K\u00e1veri, the sources of which are in Coorg. Local tradition lends colouring to the theory that the Coorgs are descended from the conquering army of a Kadamba king, who ruled in the north-west of Mysore about the 6th century A.D. The earliest trustworthy evidence that his house exerted some authority in these parts is manifested by certain stone inscriptions found in Southern Coorg, which record grants of land by monarchs of the Gang\u00e1 dynasty dated in the 9th century. But it is not probable that the mountain fastnesses of Coorg were ever permanently subjugated by the rulers of the lowlands. The Muhammadan chronicler Ferishta, writing at the end of the 16th century, casually mentions that Coorg was governed by its own princes. According to tradition, Coorg was at this period divided into 12 kombus or districts, each ruled by an independent chieftain, called a n\u00e1yak. The names of several of the families of these n\u00e1yaks are still held in veneration by the people; but the chiefs themselves all finally succumbed to the wily encroachments of the H\u00e1leri p\u00e1leg\u00e1rs, who founded the line of Coorg R\u00e1j\u00e1s expelled by the British in 1834.\n\nThe origin of this H\u00e1leri dynasty is obscure. It is certain that they were aliens to the native Coorgs who now reside in Central and South Coorg, for they belonged to the Ling\u00e1yat sect of Hindus who are the chief inhabitants in the portion of Coorg to the north and east of H\u00e1leri, and whose influence was great in the neighbouring country of Mysore; whereas the Coorgs retain to the present day their own crude forms of demon and ancestor worship. However this may be, they exercised for many generations absolute authority over the people; and, despite their bloodthirsty tyranny, they were universally accepted as the national leaders. It is commonly supposed that the founder of the dynasty was a younger scion of the family who ruled at Ikkeri in\nShimoga District, known as the *p\u00e1leg\u00e1rs* of Keladi or Bedn\u00far. He is said to have first settled at H\u00e1leri, whence he rapidly extended his power over the whole of Coorg. The history of the Coorg R\u00e1j\u00e1s is officially chronicled in the *R\u00e1jendra-n\u00e1ma*, a work compiled about 1807 in K\u00e1nares by order of Dodd\u00e1 Vira R\u00e1jendra, and translated into English by Lieutenant Abercromby in the following year. This interesting native document may be accepted as fairly trustworthy. It comprises a period of 175 years, from 1633 to 1807.\n\nThe most brilliant chapter in the history of Coorg is the resistance offered to Haidar Al\u00ed and his son Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n. When all the rest of Southern India fell almost without a blow before the Muhammadan conqueror, this warlike people never surrendered their independence; but, despite terrible disasters, finally allied themselves on honourable terms with the British to overthrow the common enemy. At one time all seemed lost. Haidar Al\u00ed had invaded the country, and carried away the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and all the royal family prisoners into Mysore. Tip\u00fa followed in his father's path with more than his father's ferocity. He resolved to remove the entire race of Coorgs, and actually deported many thousand persons to Seringapatam, and enforced on the males the rite of Isl\u00e1m. The land he granted out to Musalm\u00e1n landlords, on whom it was enjoined as an imperative duty to search for and slay the surviving inhabitants. It was reserved for a prince of the blood-royal to rescue the Coorgs from this sentence of extermination. Vira R\u00e1jendra, the hero of Coorg history, and the Coorg model of a warrior king, escaped from his prison in Mysore, and raised the standard of independence on his native hills. The Muhammadan garrison was forthwith expelled, and a successful guerilla warfare kept up until the intervention of Lord Cornwallis finally guaranteed Coorg from danger. On the restoration of peace in 1799 by the death of Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, the remaining exiled Coorgs returned to their country. But new troubles began. Vira R\u00e1jendra himself, and also his successor on the throne, appear to have been cursed with the senseless ferocity which so often accompanies irresponsible power. By their subjects they were reverenced almost as gods, and in their countless acts of cruelty they rivalled the most sanguinary deities of the Hindu Pantheon. Repeated remonstrances from the British Resident at Mysore proved ineffectual; and at last, in 1834, Vira R\u00e1jendra having taken umbrage at the shelter given at Mysore to his brother-in-law Chenna Bas\u00e1pa, Lord William Bentinck, then Governor-General of India, resolved on armed intervention. A British force of 6000 men entered Coorg in four divisions. Though two of the invading columns were bravely repulsed by the Coorg militia, the rest penetrated to Merk\u00e1r\u00e1, and achieved the entire subjugation of the country. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 surrendered himself to the Political Agent, Colonel Fraser, who issued a proclamation dated May 7, 1834,\nannouncing that, in accordance with the general wish of the inhabitants, Coorg was transferred to the government of the Company. The people were assured that their civil and religious usages would be respected, and that the greatest desire would invariably be shown to augment their security, comfort, and happiness.\n\nThe pledges given on this occasion (1834) have been faithfully carried out on both sides. In 1837, however, a disaffection originating with the Gaudas of the T\u00e1lu country, in South K\u00e1nara, spread also into Coorg; and a rising against the British Government was planned by the intrigues of the Br\u00e1hman Dew\u00e1n Lakshminar\u00e1yana, and the impostor Abhrambara, which was promptly put down by the authorities, aided by a band of faithful Coorgs, who were rewarded with j\u00e1g\u00edrs, pensions, and gold and silver medals. Coorg has ever since shown a conspicuous example of a brave and intelligent race, ruled by the British with the minimum of change and interference, and steadily advancing in material prosperity consequent on settled rule, and the introduction of coffee cultivation. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 retired to Benares, with a pension of Rs. 6000 (\u00a3600) a month. In 1852 he was allowed to visit England, where he died in 1862. His daughter, the Princess Victoria Gauramma, was baptized into the Christian faith, with the Queen for her sponsor. She married an English officer, and died in 1864. At the present day, a few descendants of the family reside at Benares, in receipt of small pensions from Government.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The whole area of Coorg is mountainous, clothed with primeval forest or grassy glades, and broken by but few cultivated valleys. The lofty barrier range of the Western Gh\u00e1ts forms the continuous western frontier for a distance of more than 60 miles. The highest peaks are Tadi\u00e1ndamol, 5729 feet, and Pushpagiri, 5548 feet above the sea. The western slope of this range drops in a succession of precipitous terraces towards the sea; but on the east a confused network of spurs and minor ridges runs out into Coorg, some of which attain considerable elevations. The town of Merk\u00e1r\u00e1 is situated on a table-land, about 3500 feet above sea-level. But even this plateau is broken by hills and steep valleys, leaving but little space for cultivation. The chief rivers of Coorg are the upper waters of the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) and its tributaries, the Lakshm\u00e1ntirtha, the Hemav\u00e1ti, and the Suvarnav\u00e1t\u00ed, with its tributaries the Hattihole and Madapur, which flow eastward into Mysore. On the west, the Barapole and the Kallahole, uniting their waters on the Coorg frontier, and a few minor streams, break their way through the Gh\u00e1ts, and precipitate themselves on the lowlands of Mal\u00e1b\u00e1r. None of the rivers are navigable. They flow in narrow valleys, usually through dense jungle; and they are little used for artificial irrigation. The geological formation of the mountains belongs to the metamorphic class of rocks, chiefly granite, syenite, and\nmica schist. The weathering of these rocks, under the influence of rain, wind, and sun, has produced a deep surface soil of great fertility, which is annually renewed by the decomposition of the virgin forest; but after the denudation of so many hill slopes for coffee cultivation, the deterioration of steep land by the wash of the monsoon rains has been rapid and ruinous to once flourishing estates. Stone and laterite are quarried for building purposes, and gold has been found on the Athol estate on the Peramb\u00e1di gh\u00e1t with graphite, and may probably be found sparsely distributed in the Br\u00e1hmagiri hills, and in the quartz reefs in the valley of the K\u00e1veri below Fraser-pet. Iron-ore also exists, but owing to the difficulty of procuring skilled labour, is not worked. The natural wealth of Coorg is represented by the boundless forests, which vary in character in different parts of the territory. The mountain forests, known as m\u00e1le-k\u00e1du, which clothe the Western Gh\u00e1ts are chiefly marked by evergreen trees. Conspicuous among these is the p\u00fan (Calophyllum angustifolium), which often rises to the height of 100 feet, and supplies excellent spars for ships. The other timber-trees in this tract include ebony (Diospyros ebenaster), jack (Artocarpus integrifolia), iron-wood (Mesua ferrea), and white cedar or t\u00fan (Cedrela toona); and the whole scene is diversified by clusters of brilliant flowers and fruits, gigantic creepers, and numerous varieties of fern. The forests in the lower hill ranges and passes in the eastern portion of Coorg are known as kanive-k\u00e1du. This is pre-eminently the region of bamboo, teak, and sandal-wood. The bamboos in the south of Coorg are specially famous. They form forests of their own, rising in clusters to the height of 60, and sometimes even 100 feet. The teak (Tectona grandis) and the sandal-wood (Santalum album) are very local in their range, the best teak trees being found in the Government reserved forest of Nalkeri, in the t\u00e1luk of Kiggatn\u00e1d. The timber of both is a valuable monopoly of Government. Other timber-trees are the blackwood (Dalbergia latifolia), maddi (Terminalia coriacea), hone or kino (Pterocarpus marsupium), dinduga (Conocarpus latifolius), and heddemara (Nauclea cordifolia). Many products of commercial value, such as wood, oil, fibre, honey, and resin, are collected in the jungle, which also abounds in wild animals; and every native Coorg is an enthusiastic sportsman. Among large game may be enumerated tigers, leopards, bears, elephants, bison, s\u00e1mbhar deer, jungle sheep, and wild hog. A reward of \u00a35 is now given by Government for the destruction of every tiger, and \u00a33, 10s. for every leopard. In the days of the Coorg R\u00e1j\u00e1s, elephant and tiger hunting were regal sports, and several tiger-cubs were generally kept about the palace. The number both of tigers and leopards is still considerable, but wild elephants have now become comparatively scarce, and their indiscriminate slaughter has been prohibited.\nPopulation.\u2014In 1836, shortly after the British occupation, the population of Coorg was returned at only 65,437 souls. The first regular Census, conducted by actual counting, was effected on the night of 14th November 1871, and gave a total of 168,312. The second regular Census was taken on the 17th February 1881, when the population numbered 178,302 persons, showing an increase of 6 per cent. during the past decade. The following table exhibits the area, population, and density in each taluk of the Province as returned by the Census of 1881:\n\n| Taluks          | Area in Square Miles | Population in 1881 | Density per Square Mile |\n|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|\n| Kiggatn\u00e1d       | 410.45               | 31,230             | 76.08                   |\n| Padinalkn\u00e1d     | 399.90               | 28,219             | 70.56                   |\n| Nanjar\u00e1jpatn\u00e1   | 263.89               | 26,984             | 102.25                  |\n| Merk\u00e1ra         | 216.30               | 34,088             | 157.59                  |\n| Yedenalkn\u00e1d     | 201.45               | 41,370             | 205.36                  |\n| Yelsavirsh\u00edme   | 90.82                | 16,411             | 180.70                  |\n| **Total**       | **1,582.81**         | **178,302**        | **112.64**              |\n\nThe Province contains 502 villages, and but one town of over 5000 inhabitants; 22,357 inhabited and 3233 uninhabited houses; which gives the following averages:\u2014Villages per square mile, 31; houses per square mile, 16.16; number of persons per occupied house, 7.97. Classified according to sex, there are 100,439 males and 77,863 females; proportion of males, 77.5 per cent. This undue preponderance of males is explained by the fact that more men are employed as labourers on the coffee estates than women. The disproportion would have been greater had the date of the Census been a month or two earlier, for at the time it was taken the picking season was over, and many of the labourers had returned to their homes in Mysore. Classified according to age, there were, under 15 years of age, 30,986 boys and 28,911 girls; total, 59,897, or 33.6 per cent. of the total population.\n\nThe division of the people according to birthplace shows\u2014154 Europeans, 2 Americans, 1 Australian, and 129 Eurasians; 103,437 natives of Coorg, 24,895 of Madras, and 48,688 of Mysore; 318 immigrants from Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, 593 from Bombay, 68 from Bengal, and 17 from Kandah\u00e1r. The occupation tables are scarcely trustworthy; but it may be mentioned, as indicating the importance of the coffee industry, that 64,087 persons, or 35.95 per cent., are returned as labourers, as compared with only 33,957 agriculturists, or 19.0 per cent. Classified according to religion, the population is composed of\u2014Hindus (as loosely grouped together for religious purposes, and including\nCoorgs), 162,489, or 91.1 per cent.; Muhammadans, 12,541, or 7.0 per cent.; Christians, 3,152, or 1.7 per cent.; and 120 'others,' including 21 Parsis and 99 Jains. The Br\u0101hmans number 2,445, chiefly belonging to the Smartta or Sivaite sect. Of those claiming to be Kshatriyas, the R\u0101jputs number 351, and the R\u0101jpinde, or connections of the late ruling family, 129. The Vaisyas, or trading caste, are 225 in number, almost exclusively Komatis. Other castes of good social standing number 83,834, among whom the most numerous caste is the cultivating Wokaliga (16,808), including many coolie immigrants from Mysore; the Lingayat (10,443) and Jain (99) castes, being engaged in trade, and many of the former in agriculture. Low castes number 21,100, and the wild tribes are returned at 54,630, but many belonging to the lower castes have been erroneously classified as such.\n\nThe native tribes of Coorgs or Kodagus, who were once the dominant race in the country, are only 27,033 in number, or 15.6 per cent. of the total population. They and the members of other castes known as the Gavada, Mopla, Heggade, Aimbokal, Bautar, and Ayeri, wear a national dress, bear arms at their pleasure, and cultivate their hereditary lands on a feudal tenure known as jama. They pride themselves on their loyalty to the British Crown. Their origin is unknown; but for the last two centuries they can be recognised as a compact body of mountaineers, resembling a Highland clan rather than a Hindu caste. Within the last decade they have increased by 6 per cent. A sub-division of them, called Amma Coorgs, who number 475, are more strict in their mode of life, and are perhaps the descendants of an indigenous priesthood. They abstain from spirituous liquors, and are vegetarians, holding much the same place among the Coorgs as Br\u0101hmans do among the Hindus. While this class has increased during the last decade, the Br\u0101hman element has decreased, due no doubt to the well-known aversion of the Coorgs to Br\u0101hmanical influence. In physique, the Coorgs are not inferior to any natives of India. The men are muscular, broad-chested, strong-limbed, and tall. Their mode of life and pride of race impart to their whole bearing an air of manly independence and dignified self-assertion, well sustained by their picturesque costume. This consists of a long coat (kupasa), of white or blue cotton, or dark cloth, open in front and reaching below the knee. Round the waist is wound a red or blue sash of cotton or silk, which holds the never-absent Coorg knife with ivory handle and chains of silver. The head-dress is a red kerchief, or a peculiarly-fashioned turban, large and flat at the top, and covering a portion of the back of the neck. For ornaments they wear a necklace of berries, and ear-rings and bracelets of silver or gold. Some of the women are strikingly handsome and well-shaped. Their holiday costume is a\ntight-fitting jacket, of white or blue cotton, with long sleeves. The skirt, gathered behind, is formed of a long piece of white muslin or blue cotton-stuff, tied round the waist and falling in graceful folds to the feet. Contrary to the custom of other Hindu women, they tie a long handkerchief over their hair as a cap, an end falling gracefully behind. The women do all the domestic work, and also bear a large share of the labours of the farm. When not engaged in labour, the men enjoy a dignified leisure, or range through the forest, gun in hand, in search of game. The height of their ambition is to be entrusted with some Government post. They rarely marry until they have attained the age of sixteen years. The old custom of polyandry is no longer practised as a national rite, but may occur in isolated cases. Divorce and widow-marriage, especially by brothers-in-law, are recognised institutions, sanctioned by the council of village elders, or takk\u00e1s. Polygamy is permitted by custom, in case of sterility of the first wife or want of male issue, but such cases are of rare occurrence.\n\nThe Coorgs have a language of their own, believed to be a dialect of K\u00e1narese, which is intelligible only to themselves and to their former slaves, the Holey\u00e1s and Yer\u00e1n\u00e1s. It is derived from the Dravidian languages, chiefly Malay\u00e1lam, T\u00falu, K\u00e1narese, and Tamil, and has been reduced to writing in K\u00e1narese letters. It is rich in forms, and admirably suited for colloquial converse, and for expressing easy-flowing poetry of a humorous or solemn strain, as their old chants or Palam\u00e9s attest.\n\nThe Muhammadans in Coorg are divided between Labbays and M\u00e1ppil\u00e1s (Moplas) from the Malab\u00e1r coast, and immigrants from the Deccan. Out of the total of 3152 Christians, Europeans number 228 and Eurasians 287, leaving 2637 for the native converts, who are mostly Roman Catholic immigrants from K\u00e1nara, of the Konkani caste. According to another principle of division, there are 644 Protestants and 2508 Roman Catholics.\n\nThere are only 2 towns in Coorg with a population of more than 3000 persons each. Merk\u00e1ra, or Mah\u00e1devapet, the civil headquarters of the Province, has 8383 inhabitants; Vira-rajendrapet, 4576. Fraser-pet, on the eastern frontier, 1000 feet below Merk\u00e1r\u00e1, is a pleasant retreat during the rainy season; formerly it used to be the residence of the British Superintendent. Merk\u00e1r\u00e1 and Vira-r\u00e1jendrapet have been constituted municipalities, with an aggregate income in 1881\u201382 of \u00a31592, giving an average municipal taxation of 2s. 5d. per head. Municipal committees have also been formed in the small towns of Fraser-pet, Somwar-pet, and Kodli-pet. Amatti and Gonikop\u00e1l are rising townships in the new coffee district in South Coorg, known familiarly as the \u2018Bamboo.\u2019\n\nCoorg possesses some remains of arch\u00e6ological interest. Cairns or dolmens have been found in considerable numbers, especially near\nVira-r\u00e1jendra-pet; and since attention was first attracted to them in 1868, several of them have been opened. They conceal kistvaens, very similar to those of Europe, composed of four upright granite slabs about 4 feet high, roofed with a larger slab. Some of these kistvaens are arranged in regular groups, others are surrounded by a circle of smaller stones. Inside is found pottery, containing bones, ashes, iron spear-heads, and beads. No trace is now preserved of the race that erected these memorials. Of a more recent date are the kolle kallu, or sculptured tombstones in honour of warriors slain in battle. The figures show that these were erected by Hindus of the Ling\u00e1yat sect. The Coorg race has left its warlike memorials in the kadangas or earthworks, which stretch over hill and dal through the length and breadth of the land. Some of these kadangas are 40 feet from summit to bottom of ditch, and they are often taken along hill-sides having an angle of 80\u00b0 F. They were evidently constructed as fortifications, but they may also have served to mark the boundaries of the n\u00e1ds, or local divisions, into which the country was divided. Of the palaces once occupied by the Coorg R\u00e1j\u00e1s, the one in the Merk\u00e1r\u00e1 fort alone remains in good order. It is used for the public offices, and as the residence of the Commissioner. The R\u00e1j\u00e1s' tombs at the head of Madepet are conspicuous and in good preservation. There is also a Hindu temple of some pretensions in the valley below the fort; and like the tombs, it is in the Muhammadan style of architecture.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Cultivation is confined in Coorg proper, above the barriers, to the numerous valleys between the eastern spurs of the Gh\u00e1ts and along the banks of the river K\u00e1veri and its affluents. Even in the narrowest valley, wherever the plough is possible, the soil is industriously laid out in terraces for rice cultivation. Excluding the forest tracts planted with coffee and cardamoms, the total cultivated area of Coorg in 1881\u201382 was 74,357 acres, of which 72,940 acres were under rice, and 1,417 acres under other food-grains. Several varieties of rice are grown, the most common being the large-grained dodda-batta. A large amount of labour is expended on the cultivation. The seed is sown about the beginning of June in nurseries, which have previously been ploughed several times, and are always so situated as to command a perennial supply of water, except in the Kiggatn\u00e1d t\u00e1luk, where the rainfall not infrequently proves insufficient. The seedlings are planted out in July and August, and the harvest is gathered in December and January. Such is the richness of the soil and the abundance of the natural water-supply, that the rice crop usually yields a return of forty-fold; the straw is in great demand for thatching purposes, and when sold to the planters, realizes enough to pay the Government dues on the land. Other crops grown only in parts of the Nanjar\u00e1jpatn\u00e1 and Yelsavirsh\u00edme t\u00e1luks to the east and north-east of the Province, are rag\u00ed,\ngram, coriander, oil-seed, hemp, a little tobacco, sugar-cane, and cotton. No wheat is grown. Plantains, oranges, and the toddy-yielding wild sago-palm, are to be seen round the homestead of every Coorg peasant. But the two most valuable products of Coorg are coffee and cardamoms. Coffee is said to have been introduced from Mysore in the days of the native R\u00e1j\u00e1s. The first European plantation was opened in 1854. By 1881, the total number of coffee estates was 4806 (212 only being owned by Europeans), covering an area of 77,474 acres, or a little more than \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)th of the whole Province. The area of land held by the European planters, in 1881, was 41,507 acres, and by natives, 35,967 acres. The average size of each estate held by the Europeans is 196 acres, and by the natives, 8 acres. The assessment paid by the former was \u00a37613, and by the latter \u00a36640. Of the whole area, 40,350 acres were in bearing, producing on an average 3 cwt. per acre, though the average yield on most European estates, which are much better cultivated than native, is as much as 7 cwts. per acre. The coffee produced is over 6000 tons. Taking the average cost of cultivation at \u00a312 per acre on European estates, and \u00a34 on native, each cwt. of coffee costs \u00a32, 13s. 4d. The number of persons present on the estates is generally about 27,000, to which 10,000 more may be added during the picking season. The yearly sum spent on coffee cultivation is about \u00a3320,000, of which about 60 per cent. is paid as wages for labour. The value of the coffee produced, calculated at the average selling price of \u00a33 per cwt. on the spot, is about \u00a3360,000.\n\nThe industry has passed through many vicissitudes. Rash speculation in the early years caused unsuitable land to be taken up, and the forest was recklessly cleared of trees that would have furnished valuable shade. The cultivation of Liberian coffee after a fair trial has proved a failure. In recent times, the \u2018bug\u2019 and \u2018white borer,\u2019 and leaf disease, especially on the Gh\u00e1ts estates, have destroyed the hopes of the planter, when at last they seemed on the point of realization; but in the \u2018Bamboo\u2019 district in South Coorg, prospects are brighter and results more satisfactory. Considerable attention has been paid to the cultivation of cinchona, especially on those estates in which coffee has not succeeded. From returns which have been obtained from planters, the extent of land under cinchona may be given at 771 acres, and the number of plants put down, at 617,156. The cardamom plant (Elettaria cardamomum) grows wild in the evergreen jungles of the Western Gh\u00e1ts, at an elevation of from 2000 to 5000 feet. These jungles are leased out by the Government for a term of ten years at a lump sum of \u00a330,000. The cardamom-yielding tracts demand a good deal of attention, and the gathering of the crop in October involves much hardship, as the jungles at that season are infested with innumerable leeches and poisonous snakes. It is estimated that a \u2018cardamom\ngarden' \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) acre in extent will yield 12\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) lbs. of dry cardamoms; the contingent expenditure is quite insignificant. Among plants introduced by European enterprise, may be mentioned Cinchona succirubra, the Australian gum tree (Eucalyptus globulus), rhea nettle (Boehmeria nivea), Manilla hemp (Musa textilis), the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao), and many English fruits, vegetables, and flowers. The cultivation of the tea-plant has as yet attracted little attention. The cultivation of cocoa, oil-seeds, and the Eucalyptus tree was only introduced a few years ago, and is purely in an experimental stage. The agricultural statistics for 1881\u201382 show a total stock of 109,762 horned cattle, 5729 sheep and goats, 12,242 pigs, 177 horses, 378 ponies, 350 donkeys, 37,523 ploughs, 27 boats, and 481 carts. The average rent per acre for land suited for rice in 1881\u201382 was from 3s. 3\\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)d. to 6s. 8\\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)d., the average produce per acre being 820 lbs. The prices per maund of 80 lbs. were, for rice, 6s. 11\\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)d.; for wheat, 9s. 10d.; for cotton, 56s.; for sugar, 34s.; for salt, 8s. 8\\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)d.; and for ragi, 4s. The wages for skilled labour were 2s. per day; for unskilled, 6d. per day.\n\nManufactures and Commerce.\u2014Almost every article used in the country requires to be imported. Manufactures do not flourish to any extent in Coorg, consequent on the great demand for labour for agricultural purposes, and the higher rates of wages prevailing. The manufacture of the ordinary coarse cloth worn by the lower classes of the people is carried on at the villages of Sirangala, Somwar-pet, Sanivarsante, and Kodli-pet in North Coorg; at the first-named place the red and dark-blue sashes worn by the poorer classes of Coorgs are also produced. About a dozen artisans add to their means by making the knives which are worn by the people as part of their ordinary dress. The sheaths are usually mounted in silver, and some of them are of considerable value. The number of knives turned out yearly does not exceed 200, and their value is estimated at \u00a3600. The steel used is of local manufacture, and of inferior quality. Large tiles, known as 'Mangalore' tiles, for which there is a considerable local demand, are manufactured at a tilery at Merk\u00e1ra. The clay obtained is of excellent quality, and some of the tiles manufactured have been found to stand a greater strain than those turned out at Mangalore itself. A few pot-makers and braziers may be found. Local traffic passes along many paths and cross country roads. Two military trunk roads run across the country from Mysore to the western coast. According to the statistics of traffic at the toll-bars, 34,399 laden carts and 31,144 laden pack-bullocks passed along these gh\u00e1t roads in 1881\u201382. The following estimates are given of the total trade of Coorg in 1881\u201382:\u2014Exports, \u00a3442,693, chiefly consisting of coffee (122,510 cwts., valued at \u00a3367,530), grain and pulse (38,687 cwts., valued at \u00a39237), cardamoms (600 cwts., valued at \u00a314,400), and\ntimber (\u00a33180); imports, \u00a3194,230, including piece-goods (\u00a330,000), wines and spirits (\u00a310,000), food-grains (\u00a322,196), and salt (\u00a316,625). The principal external markets are the ports of Mangalore, Cannanore, and Tellicherry on the Malabar coast, and Bangalore in Mysore. Local transactions are conducted at weekly fairs, the largest of which are held on Wednesdays at Vira-r\u00e1jendra-pet, on Fridays at Merk\u00e1r\u00e1, on Saturdays at Sanivarsante, on Sundays at Sunt\u00edkoppa, Amatti, and Gonikop\u00e1l, and on Mondays at Somwar-pet, all of which are largely attended.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Since the assumption of the Government by the British, the indigenous system of administration has been interfered with as little as possible. The chief resident British officer is styled Commissioner and District Judge, who discharges, in addition to his proper duties, the combined functions of Inspector-General of Prisons and Police, Director of Public Instruction, and Conservator of Forests in Coorg, and who is subordinate to the Chief Commissioner or Resident of Mysore. Under him are two Assistant Commissioners\u2014one a European, who is also a District Magistrate, and the other a Coorg. For administrative purposes, the territory is divided into 6 taluks, viz. Kiggatn\u00e1d, Padinalkn\u00e1d, Nanjar\u00e1jpatn\u00e1, Merk\u00e1r\u00e1, Yedenalkn\u00e1d, Yel-savirsh\u00edme, each under the charge of a native official styled a subahd\u00e1r. The taluks are again sub-divided into 24 n\u00e1ds or hoblis. Each n\u00e1d contains an average of about 68 square miles, and forms the separate charge of a subordinate official called a parpattegar. The following table shows the revenue and expenditure of Coorg in 1881-82:\n\n| REVENUE. | \u00a3       | EXPENDITURE. | \u00a3       |\n|----------|---------|--------------|---------|\n| Land Revenue, | 30,724  | Civil and Political, | 4,383   |\n| Forests,   | 9,959   | Judicial,     | 3,510   |\n| Excise on Spirits and Drugs, | 11,961  | Police,       | 1,445   |\n| Stamps,    | 7,691   | Military,     | 11,724  |\n| Law and Justice, | 464    | Telegraph and Post-Office, | 2,285   |\n| Interest,  | 224     | Ecclesiastical, | 697     |\n| Miscellaneous, | 64     | Public Works, | 13,602  |\n| Jails,     | 881     | Education,    | 2,249   |\n| Registration, | 421    | Miscellaneous, | 445     |\n| Education, | 218     | Local Funds,  | 4,342   |\n| Post-Office, | 1,598   | District and Village Officers, | 14,306  |\n| Public Works, | 529    | Allowances and Assignments, | 2,279   |\n| Military Refund, | 168    | Refunds,      | 927     |\n| Telegraph, | 546     | Surplus,      | 8,502   |\n| Excluded Local Funds, | 2,402  | Total,        | 70,696  |\n| Incorporated Local Funds, | 2,846  |              |         |\n\nTotal, 70,696\nThe preceding table shows a surplus revenue of \u00a38502, even including the heavy charges for the army and public works. The removal of the Coorg garrison to Vellore in Madras, which has recently been carried out, consequent on late reductions in the Madras army, increased the surplus in the balance-sheet for 1882-83 to \u00a321,145.\n\nThe land revenue is chiefly derived from three sources\u2014(1) jam\u00e1 lands, held in inalienable tenure by the once dominant race of Coorgs, at the rate of 10s. per acre (100 bhattis) of wet land upon the condition of military and police service; (2) s\u00e1g\u00fa, the ordinary cultivating tenure, at a fixed rate of about 20s. per acre; (3) coffee lands, which are now assessed at a rate of 4s. per acre. B\u00e1nes (uplands) are attached to the rice-fields for wood and pasturage; many of them are cultivated with coffee under shade. Such plantations are free from assessment when they do not exceed 10 acres. Nearly all the forest land suited for coffee cultivation has been taken up. On land which is available being applied for, it is sold by auction according to the Waste Land Rules, after being surveyed and the timber valued. It is held rent free for the first four years, and at the rate of 2s. an acre during the next eight years, after which the full assessment is charged.\n\nThe forest revenue is chiefly derived from the sale of timber and cardamom leases. In 1881-82, the sales of timber, including sandalwood, realized \u00a33827.\n\nThe regular police force consists of about 2 officers and 188 men, maintained in towns only at a total cost of about \u00a31874 a year, inclusive of the Coorg guard, employed to protect the treasury and jail. The rural or village police is composed of about 3979 jam\u00e1 r\u00e1yats, or native Coorgs, holding their lands on a feudal tenure, from whom duty for half a month in each year is expected. These figures show 113 policemen to every square mile of the area, or 1 policeman to every 43 persons of the population. During the year 1881, 1363 criminal cases of all kinds were instituted; 2000 persons were put on their trial, of whom 821, or 41 per cent., were convicted, being 1 person convicted of an offence in every 217 of the population. By far the greater number of convictions were for assault, criminal force, and offences against local laws. In the same year, the average daily number of prisoners in jail was 90\u00b76, including 4\u00b767 females, or 1 prisoner to every 1981 of the population. The total cost of the jail was \u00a31031, or \u00a311, 11s. 9d. per prisoner. Jail manufactures yielded a net profit of \u00a3380.\n\nEducation has always been an object of solicitude to the Government since the British assumed the administration of the country. The Coorgs themselves are an intelligent race, and they have repeatedly displayed a strong desire to obtain the benefits of an English education for their children. In 1862, the Coorg head-men presented a remarkable petition to Government, desiring the establishment of a boarding-\nschool at Merk\u00e1ra, towards the expense of which they contributed liberally by opening out a coffee estate, which is leased for a term of 16 years at \u00a3310 per annum. In this manner the school has been made self-supporting, and provides accommodation for 60 boys. In the year 1881, there were altogether 63 schools in the territory under Government inspection, attended by 3233 pupils. There were also 41 indigenous schools, attended by 470 pupils. These figures combined give 1 school to every 15 square miles of area, and 20 pupils to every thousand of the population. The total cost of education was \u00a32029, or an average of 12s. 6\u00bdd. per pupil; the amount of fees paid was \u00a3220, exclusive of \u00a389 for school-books. Of the total number of pupils, 331 are girls, and as many as 2100 belonged to the Coorg race, showing that 81 out of every 1000 of the Coorg population are at school. The high school at Merk\u00e1ra, under a principal and 11 masters, was attended by 313 boys in 1881. Including Government and indigenous teaching, the Census Report in 1881 returned 4268 boys and 431 girls as under instruction; besides 8839 adult males and 356 adult females able to read and write, but not under instruction.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Coorg is temperate and humid. The mountains of the Western Gh\u00e1ts collect the moisture that rolls up in clouds from the sea. The wooded valleys are not free from fogs in the morning and evening. The rainy season proper, which is the result of the south-west monsoon, lasts from June to September. The downpour of rain is very heavy on the Merk\u00e1ra plateau and on the Western Gh\u00e1ts, and blasts of wind blow at the same time with great vehemence. The sun is often not seen for weeks; and as much as 90 inches of rain have been registered at Merk\u00e1ra in the single month of July, including 10 inches within twenty-four hours. The average annual rainfall for the 20 years ending 1882 amounts to 122\u00b786 inches. By observations extending over the same period, the maximum of rainfall during the two heaviest monsoon months, June and July, occurred in the years 1864, 1865, 1869, 1872, 1874, 1880, and 1882. The total rainfall for the last-named year was 203\u00b755 inches. The rainfall in the coffee district of South Coorg, known as the 'Bamboo,' is not nearly so great. The maximum rainfall at Amatti is 72\u00b735, and the average is 65\u00b764 inches. The mean annual temperature for the whole of Coorg during the last 20 years was 66\u00b760\u00b0 F. The hottest month is May, when the thermometer sometimes rises to 82\u00b0; but on the whole, the variations of heat and cold are very moderate.\n\nThe Coorg climate is considered salubrious by the natives, and also by European residents, but its cold and damp exercise injurious effects on natives who have arrived from the plains of India. The nights are cool throughout the year, and Europeans are able to take exercise in the open air at all hours of the day. European children especially\nshow by their rosy cheeks that they enjoy excellent health. The most prevalent disease is malarious fever, which renders the mountain valleys unhealthy during the hot months. Cholera is almost unknown, but small-pox has made terrible ravages among the natives, despite the introduction of vaccination. In 1881-82, a total of 3006 deaths were reported, of which 2358 were ascribed to fevers, 117 to bowel complaints, 215 to small-pox, 12 to suicide, 4 to snake-bite, 12 to cholera, and 193 to all other causes. The death-rate was 16\u00b73 per thousand. There are 2 charitable dispensaries\u2014at Merk\u00e1r\u00e1 and Vira-r\u00e1jendra-pet\u2014at which, in 1881, a total of 429 in-door and 8665 out-door patients were treated. The total expenditure was \u00a3744, towards which Government contributed \u00a3321. In the same year, 4887 vaccinations were performed.

Also the Census Report for 1881; and the Administration Reports from 1881 to 1883.]\n\n**Coorla.**\u2014Town, Th\u00e1na District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Kurla.\n\n**Cooum (Kuvam).**\u2014River in Chengalpat District, Madras Presidency, rises in the Conjevaram taluk, and flows due east, entering the sea in lat. 13\u00b0 4' N., long. 80\u00b0 20' E. The city of Madras stands at the mouth of this river, which receives the drainage of a portion of the town. The volume of water being too small to carry off all the impurities with which it is thus charged, the Cooum here degenerates into little better than an open sewer.\n\n**Corembu G\u00e1onden.**\u2014Range of hills in the District of South Arcot, Madras Presidency, lying between 11\u00b0 51' and 12\u00b0 1' N. lat., and between 78\u00b0 42' and 78\u00b0 55' E. long.\u2014See Kalrayanmalai.\n\n**Coringa (Koringa; from Kurangam, 'a stag,' after the golden stag in the R\u00e1m\u00e1y\u00e1na; the Kalingou of Pliny).**\u2014Town and seaport in God\u00e1var\u00ed District, Madras Presidency; situated at the northern or principal mouth of the God\u00e1var\u00ed river, 8 miles south of Cocanada, in lat. 16\u00b0 48' 25\" N., and long. 82\u00b0 16' 20\" E. Population (1881) 4397, namely, 4255 Hindus, 141 Muhammadans, and 1 Christian; number of houses, 1084. An early Dutch settlement, and once the greatest seaport and shipbuilding centre on the coast; but now, owing to the extension of the delta seaward, a place of little commercial importance. The silt carried down by the God\u00e1var\u00ed has formed a bar outside the entrance. In 1802, there was a dock here in which ships of the Royal Navy were repaired; and vessels drawing 12 and 13 feet could enter. The port is still frequented by native craft, and shipbuilding yards are at work in the hamlet of Tallarevu hard by. In 1880-81, the imports were valued at \u00a31061, chiefly from Burma. The exports in the same year were valued at \u00a330,913. The trade has been steadily declining for some years, but a considerable business with Rangoon and Maulmain\nis still carried on by small vessels. In 1881-82, shipping of 6717 tons burthen entered the port; value of imports, \u00a3459; of exports, \u00a320,219. The new lighthouse on the mainland, 4\u00be miles from Cocanada, warns vessels off the God\u00e1var\u00ed shoals, and serves as a guide to ships making for Coringa or Cocanada. Koringi is the name by which all Telugus are known in Burma and the Straits, and the name of the town itself is a relic of the ancient KALINGA. The town has twice (in 1787 and 1832) been overwhelmed by a tidal wave. It also suffered very severely in the hurricane of 1839.\n\nCoromandel.\u2014The popular name applied more or less indefinitely to portions of the eastern coast of the present Madras Presidency. By some writers, the name is derived from the same source as that of the village of COROMANDEL, but the weight of authority is with those who suppose it to be a corruption of Cholamandalam, \u2018the country of the Cholas.\u2019 By this name it is repeatedly referred to in ancient native writings; and as recently as 1799, the seaboard of Coromandel was spoken of as Cholamandalam and Choramandalam. San Bartolomeo, relating in 1796 his experiences during his residence in this district, speaks of \u2018the coast of Ciolamandala, which Europeans very improperly call Coromandel,\u2019 but derives the name from cholam (Holcus sorghum), the millet which forms a staple food of the people. The true spelling of cholam in the vernacular, however, scarcely supports this theory.\u2014See CHOLA.\n\nCoromandel (Karimanal, \u2018black sand\u2019).\u2014Town in Ponneri t\u00e1luk, Chengalpat District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 13\u00b0 26' 10\" N., long. 80\u00b0 20' 36\" E. Houses, 815. Population (1881) 3807, chiefly fishermen. Mentioned as a native town as early as 1499 by Italian travellers. The kariminal, or sand used by the people instead of blotting-paper, is found here.\n\nCortelliar (Kortalaiy\u00e1ru).\u2014River of Madras Presidency; rises in the K\u00e1verip\u00e1k tank in North Arcot District, and, after passing through the Trivell\u00far and Ponneri t\u00e1luks, flows into the Enn\u00far backwater about 12 miles north of Madras. This river is the chief source of the Madras water-supply, being connected by means of an anicut with the Chod\u00e1varam and Red Hill tanks. An account of the waterworks will be found in the article on MADRAS CITY. It is said that at one time the bed of the present Cortelliar was occupied by the Pal\u00e1r. Tributaries\u2014the Mahendranad\u00ed, Sapp\u00far, Tritani, and Nagari. It was the delay caused by a sudden fresh in the Cortelliar river that led to the destruction of General Baillie\u2019s column by Haidar \u00c1li in 1780.\n\nCossimb\u00e1z\u00e1r.\u2014Decayed town in Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal.\u2014See KASIMBAZAR.\n\nCossipur (K\u00e1s\u00edpur).\u2014Ancient village on the H\u00fagl\u00ed, in the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal; now a northern suburb of\nCalcutta; on the river bank a few miles above the custom-house. Lat. $22^\\circ 37' 30''$ N., long. $88^\\circ 24' 30''$ E. The site of an important Government gun foundry.\n\n**Cossye.**\u2014River of Bengal.\u2014See Kasai.\n\n**Courtallum** (K\u00fatt\u00e1lam).\u2014Village in Tenk\u00e1s\u00ed t\u00e1luk, Tinnevelly District, Madras Presidency, and the sanitarium of the District from June to October. Lat. $8^\\circ 56' 20''$ N., long. $77^\\circ 20'$ E. Population (1881) 1216. Number of houses, 369. Although only 450 feet above sea-level, Courtallum receives the south-west monsoon through an opening in the Gh\u00e1ts, and possesses the climate and flora of a much higher elevation. The scenery is greatly admired, and the waterfalls are considered sacred by the natives. The smallest cascade is 100 feet high, and below it is a beautiful bathing-pool and a pagoda. There are several bungalows occupied for a few months every year by European officials and their families from P\u00e1l\u00e1mkott\u00e1 and Trevandrum. Distance from P\u00e1l\u00e1mkott\u00e1, 35 miles.\n\n**Covelong** (Kovilam).\u2014Village in Chengalpat District, Madras Presidency; 20 miles south of Madras. Lat. $12^\\circ 46'$ N., long. $80^\\circ 17' 40''$ E. Population (1881) 1692, chiefly fishermen, occupying 393 houses. One of the earliest European settlements, and formerly a place of some strategical importance. The fort, built by the first Naw\u00e1b of Arcot in 1745, was by a stratagem occupied in 1750 by the French. A party of soldiers, with arms concealed under their clothes, and simulating extreme sickness, were admitted into the fort by the kindly natives, who believed their tale, that they were the scurvy-smitten crew of the ship which had just anchored off the coast, unable to proceed. During the night, they rose and overpowered the garrison. In 1752, Clive invested the place, and the French surrendered without firing a shot. The fortifications were then blown up. Covelong possesses a Roman Catholic church, almshouse, and orphanage. The salt-pans to the west of the village are large, and there is some export trade in salt. Excellent oysters are found here.\n\n**Cowcally.**\u2014Lighthouse in Midnapur District, Bengal.\u2014See Geonkhali.\n\n**Cox's B\u00e1z\u00e1r.**\u2014Sub-division of Chittagong District, Bengal, lying between lat. $20^\\circ 43'$ and $21^\\circ 54'$ N., and between long. $91^\\circ 52'$ and $92^\\circ 22'$ E.

Lat. 21\u00b0 26' 31\" N., and long. 92\u00b0 1' 2\" E. Named after Captain Cox, who in 1799 was appointed to look after the many thousand Magh fugitives who sought shelter in British territory after the conquest of Arakan by the Burmese. The Maghs still form three-fourths of the inhabitants of the town, although they only number 12 per cent. of the population of the Sub-division. The Census of 1881 returned the population of Cox's B\u00e1z\u00e1r at 4363, namely, males 1887, and females 2476. The little town is now a thriving and important place, differing altogether in appearance from a Bengal village. The places of worship and the rest-houses of the Maghs are well and solidly built; and some of the houses of the well-to-do residents are not only substantial, but picturesque and neatly ornamented. The houses are built entirely of timber raised on piles, after the Burmese fashion. Municipal income in 1881\u201382, \u00a3242.\n\nCranganore.\u2014Town in Travancore State, Madras Presidency.\u2014See KRANGANUR.\n\nCuddalore (K\u00fadal\u00far).\u2014T\u00e1luk or Sub-division of South Arcot District, Madras Presidency. Area, 459 square miles, of which all but 96 are cultivated or cultivable. Houses, 47,298. Population (1881) 298,523, distributed in 2 towns and 221 villages, and occupying 42,559 houses. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014285,130 Hindus; 8026 Muhammadans (being 6869 Sunnis, 308 Shi\u00e1s, 15 Wah\u00e1b\u00eds, and 834 unspecified); Christians, chiefly Roman Catholics, 5226; Buddhists, Jains, and 'others,' 141. The land revenue for 1882\u201383 amounted to \u00a339,279. Chief places, Cuddalore and Panruti. In 1882\u201383, the t\u00e1luk contained 3 civil and 4 criminal courts, with 11 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of police force, 165 men.\n\nCuddalore (K\u00fadal\u00far, Gudul\u00far, Kudla\u00far, 'The town at the junction of the rivers').\u2014Town in Cuddalore t\u00e1luk, and administrative head-quarters of South Arcot District, Madras Presidency. Situated on the backwater formed by the confluent estuaries of the Gaddilam and Par\u00e1van\u00e1r; 116 miles by sea and 127 by rail south of Madras, and 16 miles south of Pondicherri. Lat. 11\u00b0 42' 45\" N., long. 79\u00b0 48' 45\" E. Number of houses, 8055. Population (1881) 43,545, namely, 39,997 Hindus, 1983 Muhammadans, 1510 Christians, and 55 'others.' Of the adult males, 22 per cent. are weavers or small traders. The municipal area extends over 13 square miles, including 18 hamlets which form the suburbs of the town; municipal income in 1881\u201382, \u00a32816; incidence of taxation, about 1s. 3d. per head of the rateable population. As regards popula-\ntion, Cuddalore ranks tenth among the towns of the Madras Presidency. As the head-quarters of the District administration, it contains all the chief public offices, courts, jail, etc., besides a railway station and sea-customs and marine establishments. It carries on a large land trade with Madras in indigo, oils, and sugar, which are manufactured here; and it exports by sea great quantities of grain. For the year 1881-82, the imports, chiefly coal and jaggery, were valued at \u00a363,800; and the exports, principally rice and refined sugar, at \u00a355,400. The vessels which entered the harbour in the same year aggregated 31,914 tons burthen. The river mouths having silted up, only native craft can come up to the town, but good anchorage in 6 to 8 fathoms can be obtained in the roads 1\u00bd miles from the shore. The native town, Cuddalore proper, lies in a low, damp site about 2 miles south of Munjakupam, where the Europeans reside. It is well laid out, and the houses are exceptionally substantial. It contains the jail (formerly the Company\u2019s factory), the barracks, now unoccupied, and the marine and mercantile offices. The European quarter, which stands on slightly higher ground, contains all the public offices, scattered on a large plain, intersected by good roads with avenues of trees. The station has a reputation for being healthy. About 1\u00bc mile north-east are situated the ruins of Fort St. David, on the left bank of the Gaddilam river.\n\nThe history of Cuddalore dates from 1682, when the Company opened negotiations with the \u2018Kh\u00e1n of Gingee\u2019 for permission to settle here. The first building was erected in 1683, and in the following year a formal lease was obtained for the site of the present port and the former fortress. During the next ten years, trade increased so rapidly that the Company erected Fort St. David for the protection of the place, and rebuilt their warehouses. On the fall of Madras in 1746, the British administration withdrew to Cuddalore, which was soon afterwards twice unsuccessfully besieged by the French under Dupleix. The head-quarters of the Presidency remained here till 1752, when the Government returned to Madras. During this interval, the Jesuits were expelled from the settlement as spies in the French service. In 1755, Clive was in command at Cuddalore. In 1758, the French occupied the town, and stormed and destroyed the fort; but in 1760, after the battle of Wandiwash, the British regained possession. In 1782, it again fell into the hands of the French and their ally Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, by whom the fortifications were sufficiently renewed to enable it to withstand in the following year a siege and several assaults. During the siege, a drawn battle was fought in the roadstead between the French and English fleets. In 1785, Cuddalore was formally restored to the British, and in 1801 it was included in the cession of the Karnatic. Of the fort, only a few ruins now remain, but it must once have been a place of considerable strength.\nCuddapah (Kadap\u00e1).\u2014A District in the Presidency of Madras, lying between $13^\\circ 25'$ and $16^\\circ 20'$ N. lat., and $77^\\circ 55'$ and $79^\\circ 40'$ E. long. Area, 8745 square miles. Population (1881) 1,121,038. In point of size, this District ranks second, and in population fifteenth, among the Districts of the Madras Presidency. It contains 1231 villages and 10 towns. Land revenue (1881), \u00a3161,743; total revenue (gross), \u00a3201,321. Bounded on the north by the District of Karn\u00fal (Kurnool), on the east by the District of Nellore, on the south by North Arcot District and Kol\u00e1r District in the State of Mysore, and on the west by the District of Bellary. The administrative head-quarters of the District are at Cuddapah town.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Cuddapah (Kadap\u00e1) District lies beneath the western slopes of the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts and the opposing face of the Mysore plateau, forming an irregular parallelogram, shut in on the east and south by high mountain ranges, and on the west and south-west stretching away into broad plains. The system of hill chains that shapes this country radiates from two centres. That in the south-east corner of the District lies near the holy hill of Tripatti (Tirupati), a point from which two main ranges strike northwards. The first range is that of the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts, which here reach, and in some parts exceed, an elevation of 3000 feet, their average height being about 2000 feet above sea-level. The other is the P\u00e1lkonda and Sesh\u00e1chalam range, extending as far as the river Penn\u00e1r (Ponnaiy\u00e1r), and to within a few miles of Cuddapah town. P\u00e1lkonda is the common name of the range, meaning the \u2018milk hill,\u2019 so called on account of its fine pasturage. This P\u00e1lkonda and Sesh\u00e1chalam range, reaching an average elevation of about 1500 feet, bisects the District into two divisions, the one of a lowland, the other of a highland character, which differ materially in general aspect and character\u2014so much so, that for climate and soil, cultivation and condition, they might be in different degrees of latitude. Each division, also, has a separate history of its own. The upper division consists in part of a bare expanse of black cotton-soil, and elsewhere of thickly-wooded hills, from which impetuous torrents descend in the rainy season to the Penn\u00e1r, the only stream in Cuddapah which deserves the name of river. The lower half of the District, skirted on the east and north-east, by the same Sesh\u00e1chalam range, slopes up gently from the foot of the hills till it merges in the Mysore plateau, undulating so continuously throughout its extent that it would be difficult to find in the whole a perfectly level mile of ground. Isolated hills and masses of rock stud the country, in some instances, as at Gurrakonda, forming objects of peculiar picturesque-ness and grandeur. The main watershed of the country runs north-west and south-west, discharging its drainage into the central valley of the Penn\u00e1r, the chief tributaries being the Kundair and Sagalair. The\nother larger streams are the P\u00e1paghni, the Cheyair, and the Chitravat\u00ed. This last enters the District in the extreme north-west, and after a course of only 8 miles within it, falls into the Penn\u00e1r. The Cheyair exhibits scenery of remarkable grandeur along its course; and all the rivers have hills of alluvial soil, varying in breadth, sloping up from either bank. Excepting the Penn\u00e1r, which flows from west to east through the upper half of the District, and north of the line of railway, the streams of Cuddapah are small, but they are all of value to the country, as on their banks are the busiest centres of population. The forest area is large, and the timber\u2014blackwood, yellama, jept, shandamon, etc.\u2014valuable; but only 10,000 acres are at present conserved, and these chiefly for railway requirements. The chief mineral products of the District are iron-ore, lead, copper, limestone, slate, and sandstone for building purposes. Diamonds have been worked for and found on the right bank of the Penn\u00e1r about 7 or 8 miles north of Cuddapah town, in the neighbourhood of Chen\u00far. Among the wild beasts, leopards, s\u00e1mbhar deer, bear, wild boar, and porcupine may be considered characteristic of the jungle-clad hill tracts, while elsewhere antelope, wolf, hy\u00e6na, and fox are common.\n\nHistory.\u2014Passing over the tradition which assigns to Cuddapah a conspicuous place in the story of R\u00e1ma, and that debateable era when three Hindu kingdoms are said to have divided Southern India, the history of the District begins with the Muhammadan period. The Hindu kings of Vijayanagar then exercised feudal authority over this tract, which was long saved by its numerous hill forts from falling under permanent subjugation at the hands of the Musalm\u00e1ns. But after the disaster of T\u00e1likut in 1565, Cuddapah became the high road for the armies invading the Karnatic, and was distributed piecemeal among various Muhammadan chiefs subordinate to the Golconda kingdom. One of these, the Gurramkonda Naw\u00e1b, exercised more than local powers; he enjoyed the privilege of coining money, and, except for the feudal obligation of military aid, was subject to none of the usual conditions of a tributary. But about 1642, the estate fell into the possession of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and the chief had to fly to the Niz\u00e1m, by whom he was subsequently assigned another j\u00e1gir. Meanwhile, Cuddapah was given up to plunder by Sivaj\u00ed, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1, who placed Br\u00e1hmans in charge of each of the conquered strongholds, and, to use a phrase of contemporary history, \u2018scraped the country to the bones.\u2019 A gap now occurs in local history. But early in the following century, we find Abdul Nab\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, the Path\u00e1n \u2018Cuddapah Naw\u00e1b,\u2019 acting independently of the Niz\u00e1m, and laying under tribute the p\u00e1leg\u00e1rs of the tract known as the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l, notably the Chief of Pungan\u00far, who, besides an annual payment of 32,000 pagodas, was required to maintain a force of 2000 armed men. Three Naw\u00e1bs of Cuddapah ruled in succession, each\nincreasing the power bequeathed to him; but the third came into collision with the rising power of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s about the year 1732, and from this event dates the decline of the house. In 1750, however, the Cuddapah Naw\u00e1b was still playing an important part in the affairs of the Karnatic. In the following year he headed the conspiracy in which Muzaffar Jang, the Niz\u00e1m, lost his life in the Luckereddipalli Pass. In 1757, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s gained a decisive victory over the Naw\u00e1b at the town of Cuddapah, but lost all advantage from the victory by the advance of the army of the Niz\u00e1m, with a French contingent under M. Bussy. Meanwhile, Haidar Al\u00ed had risen to supreme power in Mysore. Jealous of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 successes, he intrigued successfully for the surrender of Gurramkonda fort; and in 1769, having signed a truce with the British, turned all his attention to Cuddapah. In a secret treaty with the Niz\u00e1m he stipulated for a joint invasion of the Coromandel coast and, in the distribution of conquered lands, for the possession of Cuddapah by Mysore. A series of invasions and counter-invasions followed. In 1782, on the death of Haidar Al\u00ed, a descendant of the last Cuddapah Naw\u00e1b claimed the title, and was supported by a small British detachment, which, however, was treacherously massacred during a parley. For the next few years, Cuddapah enjoyed comparative rest; but in 1790, when the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the Niz\u00e1m, and the British combined to overthrow Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s first step was to recover Cuddapah. In 1792, Tip\u00fa signed a treaty ceding the whole of Cuddapah District, with the fort of Gurramkonda, to the Niz\u00e1m, who granted it in j\u00e1gir three years later to M. Raymond, to defray the expenses of the contingent under his command. But the Madras Government, disquieted by this occupation of so important a frontier post, compelled M. Raymond\u2019s withdrawal by threatening to attack Cuddapah. For the next few years, a general scramble for the forts of the District took place among the p\u00e1leg\u00e1rs. In 1799, after the fall of Seringapatam, Cuddapah was transferred by the Niz\u00e1m to the British, in satisfaction of arrears of pay due by him to his British contingent. In 1800, this cession was formally ratified, and since that date the District has had but little history. Sir Thomas Munro, the first Collector of \u2018the Ceded Districts\u2019 (Cuddapah, Kurnool, and Bellary), found Cuddapah held by some 80 p\u00e1leg\u00e1rs or feudal chiefs, all maintaining bodies of retainers who subsisted entirely by plundering the open villages. These feudal chiefs asserted their independence, which they maintained with less difficulty because of the isolated tracts into which the hill-bounded river basins split up the country. They were, however, one after the other, reduced to submission; and the District was surveyed, assessed, and brought into order by the establishment of a police and a settled administration of justice. In 1807, when Sir Thomas Munro retired from his post, the Madras Government recorded\ntheir appreciation of his services in the following order:\u2014'From disunited hordes of lawless plunderers and freebooters, the people are now as far advanced in civilisation, submission to the laws, and obedience to the magistrates as any of the subjects under this Government. The revenues are collected with facility; every one seems satisfied with his position, and the regret of the people is universal on the departure of the Principal Collector.' In 1832, the Path\u00e1ns of Cuddapah, affecting to see in an act committed by one of their own faith an attempt to outrage a place of worship, raised a riot, in which the Sub-Collector (Mr. Macdonald) was murdered. In 1846, a descendant of the dispossessed p\u00e1leg\u00e1r of Nossum, dissatisfied with the pension he received, attempted to excite a general rebellion, and collected on the frontiers two forces of several thousand men. Each was promptly defeated by British detachments, and before the end of the year quiet was completely restored. Since that date, no event of historical importance has occurred. Of all the turbulent p\u00e1leg\u00e1rs, not one now remains in occupation of his ancestral property, but their descendants receive allowances from the Government. Their estates are now held on direct tenure by the cultivators, to whom they have been leased in small lots.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1871 disclosed a total population of 1,351,194 persons, living in 339,603 houses, on an area of 8367 square miles, giving an average of 4 persons per house, and 161 per square mile. The Census of 1881 returned the area at 8745 square miles, and the total population at 1,121,038, showing a decrease of 230,156 persons in the decade, or 17\u00b703 per cent., due to the famine of 1876-78, which was most severe in this District. The male population was returned at 569,970; the female at 551,068; proportion of males in total population, 50\u00b79 per cent. Number of houses, 247,186. Number of persons per square mile, 128, varying from 194 in the Cuddapah t\u00e1luk to 93 in R\u00e1yachoti\u2014in point of density the District stands lowest but four among the Districts of the Presidency; number of persons per house, 4\u00b75. As regards the religious distinctions of the people, 1,017,211, or 90\u00b774 per cent., were returned as Hindus; 97,749, or 8\u00b772 per cent., as Muhammadans; 6067, or 0\u00b754 per cent., as Christians, and 11 'others.' Children under the age of 10 years numbered 116,045 males and 119,408 females. Between 10 and 20 years the males were 129,350, the females 112,187. The Hindu population was distributed as follows:\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 24,226; Kshattriyas, 16,650; Chetties (traders), 34,261; Vall\u00e1lars (agriculturists), 442,520; or 43\u00b75 per cent. of the total population; Id\u00e1iyars (shepherds), 86,093; or 8\u00b74 per cent.; Kamm\u00e1lars (artisans), 13,638; Kaikalar (weavers) 52,168, or 5\u00b712 per cent.; Vanniyan (labourers), 771; Kushavar (potters), 10,139; Sat\u00e1ni (mixed castes), 13,517; Shemb\u00e1davan (fisher\nmen), 35,256; Sh\u00e1n\u00e1n (toddy-drawers), 7435; Ambattan (barbers), 14,705; Vann\u00e1n (washermen), 28,947; Pariahs, 147,733, or 14\u00b75 per cent.; and 'others,' 89,854. According to occupation, 15,657, or 1\u00b740 per cent. of the total population, are 'professional;' 4078, or 0\u00b736 per cent., are 'domestic;' 19,410, or 1\u00b773 per cent., are 'commercial;' 478,467, or 42\u00b768 per cent., are 'agricultural;' 134,332, or 11\u00b798 per cent., are 'industrial;' and 469,094, or 41\u00b785 per cent., belong to the 'indefinite and non-productive' class,\u20142\u00b739 per cent. among the last being returned as 'occupied.' About 60\u00b754 per cent. are returned as workers, on whom the remaining 39\u00b746 per cent. of the population depend; 71\u00b751 per cent. of males, and 49\u00b721 per cent. of females, were workers. There were 51,693 persons who were either educated or under instruction, of whom only 1882 were females. The Christians of this District are better taught than any other class of natives.\n\nIt is noteworthy that, while the Br\u00e1hmans are by a vast majority returned as Siva-worshippers, the Kshattriyas are generally Vaishnavs. The Muhammadans are arranged as follows:\u2014Shaikhs, 6579; Sayyids, 998; Path\u00e1ns, 1228; Mughals, 111; Lubbays, 60; and 'others,' 9421, excluding 79,352 Muhammadans returned under the heading 'not stated.' Of the native Christians, nearly all are Pariahs, and of the Protestant faith; of Europeans there were only 42; and of Eurasians, 282. The wandering tribes\u2014known to the police as 'the criminal classes'\u2014comprise the Yanadis, Yerukalas, Chenchuwars, and Sugalis. The first of these, a low-statured race, live among the hills on the frontier of the District, descending at times to take employment in the plains. In their unreclaimed state they are the determined plunderers of the shepherds' flocks. In the Forest Department their woodcraft is turned to good account. The Yerukalas will seldom settle, preferring to wander about, under pretence of collecting jungle produce. A favourite form of crime with them is to enter an unguarded house at night and wrench the jewels from the ears of sleeping women and children. The Sugalis, who are comparatively harmless, resemble European gipsies in their wandering life, picturesque costume, and pilfering tendencies. The Chenchuwars, physically a fine race of men, are most incorrigible criminals, showing little regard for human life; in habits they are not unlike the Yanadis.\n\nThe chief towns are\u2014Cuddapah, which is the only municipal town in the District, with 18,982 inhabitants; Badvel, 8638; Proddatur, 6510; Jammulamadugu, 4846; Kadiri, 5004; Madanapalli, 5700; Pulivendala, 1885; Rayachoti, 4367; Vempalle, 5811; and Vayalpad, 3695.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The Cuddapah agriculturists are good farmers, and the alluvial soil of the valleys produces rich crops. They manure very highly, using for that purpose animal, vegetable and mineral manures.\nIn the Cuddapah valley especially the soil is very rich, and grain of all kinds is grown, as well as cotton and indigo. Tamarind trees are largely planted, 800 lbs. weight of the cleaned fruit selling for 10s. The trees, however, only bear every second year. The cultivator now holds his lands under the r\u0101yatw\u0101r\u012b system of tenure. Formerly (in 1808), land was held under a three years\u2019 lease, on the \u2018village rent system,\u2019 each village being farmed out to a separate and solely responsible renter. This did not succeed, and in 1811 a lease for ten years was substituted, which continued up to 1821. The inhabitants of the District still speak of those days as one incessant period of extortion from the under-tenants, and of absconding and punishment of the renters. The ten years\u2019 lease system, proving unsatisfactory, was abolished; and the r\u0101yatw\u0101r\u012b system was introduced, which caused the revenue to fall to about \u00a3150,000 in the first year of its introduction (1822). From this time, however, it began steadily to rise, until in 1830 it reached \u00a3200,000, at which average it has stood since. As regards ordinary \u2018wet\u2019 crops, such as rice, ragi, etc., the out-turn per acre may be valued at about \u00a35 per annum, and the net profit to the r\u0101y\u0101t at \u00a32. The average size of an ordinary cultivator\u2019s holding is 6\u00bd acres. Cotton has always been largely cultivated in the northern taluks, and indigo is grown very generally over the District. The cotton soil demands continual care, since, if neglected for a short time, it is liable to be overgrown by a weed known as \u2018nut grass,\u2019 which spreads very rapidly and can only be ploughed up with great labour. Sugar-cane cultivation requires very deep ploughing and a constant supply of water. An acre of cane ought to produce about 12,000 lbs. of jaggery (crude sugar), worth in the market about \u00a322. Of the total area of the District, 8745 square miles (5,596,800 acres), 2,889,007 acres were returned in 1881\u201382 as assessed to Government revenue. The area actually under cultivation was 1,495,514 acres, of which 178,534 acres were irrigated. The cultivable area not under the plough was 1,143,287 acres; pasture and forest lands, 184,080 acres; uncultivable waste, 2,776,039 acres; total uncultivated, 4,103,406 acres. Of the total area, 775,438 acres are held in in\u0101m, or under a free grant. The staple cereals of the District are the millets, cholam (Sorghum vulgare), kambu (Panicum spicatum), and korra (Panicum italicum), which occupied between them 769,243 acres of the cultivated area; 283,282 acres being taken up by other cereals, as ragi (Eleusine coracana), wheat, rice, etc. Of the remaining cultivated area, peas, lentils, and other pulses occupied 149,243 acres; orchard and garden produce, 25,635 acres; tobacco, 5084 acres; chillies and cummin, 13,508 acres; sugar-cane, 3034 acres; oil-seeds, 40,210 acres; indigo, 100,772 acres; saffron, 1449 acres; cotton, 96,743 acres; jute\nand other fibres, 355 acres. The agricultural stock of the District comprised in 1881-82, 212,924 horned cattle, 10,630 donkeys, 385 horses, 1,474 ponies, 220,273 sheep, 235,038 goats, 8,462 pigs, 41,152 carts, and 108,929 ploughs. The prices of produce ruling at the end of the same year, per maund of 80 lbs., were\u2014for rice, 6s.; wheat, 6s.; other grains, 2s.; sugar, 32s.; linseed, 16s.; salt, 8s.; jute, 12s.; cotton, 32s.; and sheep, 5s. to 6s. each. The wages for skilled labour were from 1s. to 1s. 3d. per day, and of unskilled, from 3d. to 5d.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Between 1800 and 1802 there was considerable distress in Cuddapah, and relief works were opened. Again in 1866 very high prices obtained; and the great drought of 1876-77 caused severe suffering throughout the District. In 1865, part of the District suffered from a visitation of grasshoppers. From the commencement of the District history, alternate droughts and floods appear to have prevailed. Three years of drought preceded a great bursting of the tanks in 1803; and in 1818, after a dry year, 180 tanks in one taluk alone were breached by the sudden and excessive rainfall. In 1820, a violent storm burst 770 tanks, causing the destruction of a few human lives and many cattle. In 1851, there was a greater mortality from the same cause; in one of the villages swept away, 500 people were drowned. Cuddapah suffered severely in the great Madras famine of 1877, for an account of which see the article on MADRAS PRESIDENCY.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014The manufacture of cloth from the cotton produced in the District ranks first among the local industries. In 1804, the number of looms was estimated, under the East India Company's system of 'Investments,' at 19,626, turning out annually goods to the value of \u00a3230,000; and in 1875, the out-turn of cotton having more than doubled since 1804, the value of the manufactured produce was estimated at \u00a3400,000. The manufacture of indigo has of late years decreased, the European firms having closed their factories, and the business falling entirely into the hands of native producers. The sugar made in Cuddapah commands a market throughout Southern India, the cane being of superior quality. The 'Imperial' and 'Minor' irrigation works of the District comprise 434 channels and 995 tanks, irrigating an area of 235,612 acres, and yielding a revenue of \u00a385,379. The roads of the District aggregate a length of 1123 miles (a great portion being over cotton soil, and passable only in dry weather), and are spread equally over the District. They branch off from the three main lines from Madras to Bellary, Karnul (Kurnool), and Kadiri. The Kurnool-Cuddapah canal enters the District in the Proddat\u016br taluk. It is taken across the Penn\u0101r at Adniam\u0101yapalli by means of an anicut which holds up the water at the required level, and terminates,\nafter a course of 191 miles, at the Krishnapuram station of the Madras Railway, 4 miles from Cuddapah. The total length of canals in the District is 75 miles. The Madras Railway (North-West Line) traverses the District for 102 miles, with 14 stations.\n\nThe religious institutions of the District are important in the aggregate, Government continuing an ancient allowance of \u00a32700, and local piety contributing extensive endowments. The Car Festival in the Proddat\u00far and other t\u00e1luks, the Bathing Festival of Pushpagiri, and the Gang\u00e1 jatr\u00e1 Festivals, all attract large assemblages, and facilitate the interchange of local products.\n\nAdministration.\u2014For administrative purposes, the District is divided into 11 t\u00e1luks, namely, Badvel, Cuddapah, Jammulamadugu, Kadiri, Madhanapalle, Proddatur, Pullivendala, Pullampet, Rayachoti, Sidhout, and Vayalpad. The land revenue amounted in 1881 to \u00a3161,743, while excise yielded \u00a320,370; stamps, \u00a315,354; and assessed taxes, \u00a33854. Total revenue, \u00a3201,321. The estimated money value of the lands alienated in payment of service amounts to about \u00a377,000. This does not, however, include the alienations in personal and religious in\u00e1ms, amounting to an additional \u00a360,000. In fact, such an excessive quantity of in\u00e1m land has been granted in this District, that the cultivating class is to a considerable degree independent of Government land. The administration of justice is conducted by 7 civil and 5 revenue judges; the number of magistrates of all grades is 30. The police force comprises 1058 officers and men of all ranks, giving a proportion of 1 to every 8 square miles and every 1060 of the inhabitants, and is maintained at a cost of \u00a316,688. The District possesses one jail in the town of Cuddapah, with a daily average population of 145, costing \u00a39, 15s. per prisoner.\n\nEducation is provided by grants from the Local Funds, and by Government. In 1881-82 there were 495 schools, including 3 girls' schools, distributed over the District, with a total attendance of 8425 pupils, besides 158 indigenous schools with an average roll of 2814 pupils. The one municipality is that of Cuddapah, with an income, in 1881-82, of \u00a32958, from which are supported an elementary school, civil dispensary, vaccinating staff, conservancy establishments, and municipal police.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate, though trying, does not appear to be unhealthy. In January and February, north-east winds, cool and dry, keep the temperature at about 75\u00b0 F., but in March the heat begins to increase, and till the end of June the mean varies from 95\u00b0 to 100\u00b0 in the shade. From July to September inclusive, cooler breezes, with occasional showers, prevail from the south-west; and from September to December, during the north-east monsoon, the temperature averages\nCholera occasionally visits the District in an epidemic form, but causes no serious mortality. Small-pox shows a lower death-rate than in any other District of the Presidency, except Ganjam and South Kanara. Fever carries off great numbers annually; and to this cause is probably due the reputation for unhealthiness unfairly bestowed on the District. The disease called 'Madura-foot' is endemic in the black cotton-soil taluks. There are three dispensaries in the District\u2014at Cuddapah, Proddat\u016br, and Madanapalli. The number of births registered in the District in 1881 was 32,867, or a ratio of 29.3 per 1000 of population. The number of registered deaths in the same year was 20,343, or 18.1 per 1000, the mean for the previous five years being 27.4. Vaccination still meets with opposition, and makes but little progress. The annual rainfall for 30 years ending 1881 averaged 27.26 inches. [For further information regarding Cuddapah, see the Manual of Cuddapah District, by J. D. B. Gribble, Esq., C.S. (Madras, 1875). Also the Census Report of Madras (1881); and the Annual Administration Reports of the Madras Presidency from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nCuddapah (Kadap\u0101).\u2014Taluk or Sub-division of Cuddapah District, Madras Presidency. Area, 760 square miles, containing 31,104 houses, grouped into 1 town and 146 villages; population (1881) 147,453, namely, 74,421 males and 73,032 females. The taluk forms a basin completely shut in on three sides by the Lankamalai and Seshachalam Hills, and watered by the Pennar (Ponniy\u0101r), which within its limits receives three tributary streams, the Kundair, P\u0101paghni, and Bugair. Diamond-yielding quartzite is found at the foot of the hills above Chennur and Kanuparti. The farming carried on in this taluk is decidedly superior to that of the rest of the District. The use of both irrigation and manure is more resorted to than elsewhere, and the rotation of crops is better understood. Cuddapah indigo, which differs in being extracted from the plants when green, commands a higher price than indigo from other parts of the Madras Presidency. Of the total area, only about one-third pays land revenue. The chief places are Cuddapah, Kamalapuram, Akkayapali, and Komadi. The Madras Railway (North-West Line) has 3 stations within the taluk, and good roads run alongside the canal which traverses the river valley. Education is very backward, even the ordinary payal schools being remarkably few in number, and exclusive. Land revenue demand (1882\u201383), \u00a326,349. In the same year, the taluk contained 2 civil and 5 criminal courts, with 11 police stations (\u1e6dh\u0101n\u0101s), and a police force numbering 255 officers and men. Historically, the interest of the taluk centres in its chief town, Cuddapah.\n\nCuddapah (Kadap\u0101).\u2014Town and administrative head-quarters of Cuddapah District, Madras Presidency; situated in lat. 14\u00b0 28' 49\" N.,\nand long. $78^\\circ 51' 47''$ E., in the Penn\u00e1r (Ponnaiy\u00e1r) valley, 6 miles south of that river and 161 miles by rail from Madras; population (1881) 18,982, namely, 11,216 Hindus, 7273 Muhammadans, and 493 Christians, occupying 4015 houses. Municipal income in 1881-82, \u00a32958; incidence of taxation, about 3s. 1d. per head. As the head-quarters of the District, Cuddapah contains all the chief offices of local administration, the Judge's and Collector's courts, jail, telegraph and post offices. The trade consists chiefly in the export of indigo and cotton, and the principal industry is the weaving of coarse cloth. The town, being enclosed on three sides by bare sandstone hills, is one of the hottest in the District, the mean temperature in the shade from March to July being $97^\\circ$ F.; annual rainfall, 27 inches. The native town is unhealthily situated and squalidly built, the proportion of substantial buildings being much lower than in many large villages. Cuddapah is sometimes said to have been a place of importance under the Vijayanagar dynasty. But the existence of a hamlet in the neighbourhood called Old Cuddapah (Pata-Cuddapah), and the total absence of ancient Hindu buildings, prove the modern origin of the present town. Muhammadan local tradition names Abd\u00fal Nabi Mi\u00e1 as the founder; but it seems more probable that one of the Path\u00e1n lieutenants of the Golcondah army erected the fort about 1570. It is not till the beginning of the 18th century, when the so-called Naw\u00e1b of Kurpa (Cuddapah) had absorbed the whole of the tract known as the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, except G\u00fati (Gooty), and had extended his conquests to the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l, that Cuddapah appears as the capital of a separate kingdom (see Cuddapah District). In 1748, the Naw\u00e1b followed the standard of the Niz\u00e1m Muzaffar Jang to the Southern States, and two years afterwards murdered his lord paramount with his own hand. Eight years later, retribution overtook him; his country was invaded by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, to whom he was compelled to cede half his estates, including Gurramkonda fort; and at the same time Haidar Ali of Mysore wrested the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l from him. In 1769, the Naw\u00e1b of Cuddapah paid tribute to Mysore; but having in the following year joined the Niz\u00e1m, he was attacked by Haidar Ali, and, in spite of a gallant defence, his fort was captured. Soon after the Naw\u00e1b surrendered at Sidhaut. In 1792, Cuddapah was restored by treaty to the Niz\u00e1m, who made it over for a time in j\u00e1gir to M. Raymond, for the expenses of the French contingent. In 1800 it was ceded to the East India Company, and in 1817 constituted the head-quarters of the District. Since 1868 it has ceased to be a military cantonment.\n\nThe name has been derived from Kripa, 'mercy' (Sansk.); but others connect it with Gadapa, 'a gate' (Telugu)\u2014i.e., 'the gate to Tripati.' During the Muhammadan occupation, the town was called Neku\u00e1m\u00e1b\u00e1d.\nCulna.\u2014Sub-division and town in Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal.\u2014See Kalna.\n\nCumbum (Kambam).\u2014Town in Madura District, Madras Presidency; situated in the valley of the same name, in the south-west of the District. Lat. $9^\\circ 44' 50''$ N., long. $77^\\circ 26' 35''$ E.; population (1881) 5361, almost all Hindus; number of houses, 768. The valley is a fertile tract sheltered by the Travancore Hills, and watered by a feeder of the Vygai (Vaig\u00e1i). The fort of Cumbum was stormed by Vishwan\u00e1th Nayak in the 16th century.\n\nCumbum (Kambam).\u2014Town in Karn\u00fal (Kurnool) District, Madras Presidency, and head-quarters of the taluk of the same name. Lat. $15^\\circ 34' 15''$ N., long. $79^\\circ 9' 1''$ E.; population (1881) 7170, namely, Hindus, 4691; Muhammadans, 2471; and Christians, 8; number of houses, 2238. The Local Fund grant (about \u00a3150) is inadequate to meet the sanitary wants of the place; and no town in the Presidency has a worse reputation for fever. A tank or lake has been formed here by damming the Gundlakamma river by a bandh 57 feet high, thrown between two hills. This lake has an area of about 15 square miles, and is largely used for irrigation. The only building of interest is a dismantled fort.\n\nCutch (Kachchh, or the sea-coast land).\u2014Native State in Gujar\u00e1t under the political superintendence of the Government of Bombay; bounded on the north and north-west by the Province of Sind, on the east by Native States under the P\u00e1lanpur Agency, on the south by the peninsula of K\u00e1thi\u00e1war and the Gulf of Cutch, and on the south-west by the Indian Ocean. Its limits, inclusive of the great salt marsh termed the Rann (Runn), extend from lat. $20^\\circ 47'$ to $24^\\circ$ N., and from long. $68^\\circ 26'$ to $71^\\circ 10'$ E. The territory comprises a belt of land, 160 miles from east to west and about 35 to 70 from north to south. The area of the State, exclusive of the Rann, is about 6500 square miles, containing 8 towns and 889 villages; population in 1881, 512,084. The capital is Bhuj, where the Chief or R\u00e1o resides.\n\nFrom its isolated position, the special character of its people, their peculiar dialect, and their strong feeling of personal loyalty to their ruler, the peninsula of Cutch has more of the elements of a distinct nationality than any other of the dependencies of the Bombay Presidency.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The whole territory of Cutch is almost entirely cut off from the continent of India\u2014north by the Great Rann, east by the Little Rann, south by the Gulf of Cutch, and west by the eastern or Kori mouth of the Indus. Though on the whole treeless, barren, and rocky, the aspect of the country is varied by ranges of hills and isolated peaks, by rugged and deeply-cut river beds, and by well-tilled valleys and tracts of rich pasture land. On the south, behind\na high bank of sand that lines the sea-coast, lies a low, fertile, and well-cultivated plain from 20 to 30 miles broad. Beyond this plain, the Dora, a broad belt of hilly ground, stretches east and west from 500 to 1000 feet above the level of the plain. Behind the Dora range lies a rich valley, bounded to the north by the Ch\u00e1rw\u00e1r, a second line of hills parallel to the first, but higher, narrower, and, especially along the northern side, more precipitous. Again, beyond the Ch\u00e1rw\u00e1r Hills, a low-lying belt of rich pasturage, about 7 miles broad, stretches northwards to the Great Rann or salt desert; and, close to its southern shore, four hilly islands (from one of which rises Patcham P\u00edr, the highest point in Cutch, 1450 feet above the level of the sea) stand out from the bed of the Rann. Each of the two chief ranges that, stretching east and west, form as it were a double backbone to the peninsula of Cutch, is marked by one peak of special height and of peculiar shape. Of these, N\u00e1nu, the centre point of the southern hills, is nearly 800, and Indria, the most prominent peak of the northern hills, nearly 900 feet above the sea-level. Besides these two main ranges, in the southwest a broken line of hills, and from the central plains isolated peaks rising to a commanding height, give the greater part of the State a rugged and rocky appearance. Except some brightly-coloured cliffs and boulders, the hills are dusty brown and white, their sides bare or covered with a stunted brushwood. From the sea on the south and west, and from the Rann on the north and east, the coast is in some places very slightly raised and fringed with mangrove swamps.\n\nThere are no permanent rivers in Cutch, but during the rainy season (July to October) many streams of considerable size flow from the central ranges of hills northwards to the Rann and southwards to the Gulf of Cutch. For the rest of the year, the courses of these streams are marked by a succession of detached pools. Owing to the porous nature of the upper soil, storage of water in ponds and reservoirs is difficult. But in rocks, at no great depth from the surface, water is readily found, and wells yielding excellent supplies are numerous.\n\nThe Rann.\u2014The most striking physical feature of Cutch is the Rann or salt desert, stretching along the north and east of the State, which is estimated to cover an area of nearly 9000 square miles. It is believed to be the bed of an arm of the sea, raised by some natural convulsion above its original level, and cut off from the ocean. It almost completely surrounds the State with a belt, varying in width from 25 to 35 miles on the north to 2 miles on the east. The northern or larger Rann\u2014measuring from east to west about 160 miles, and from north to south about 80\u2014has an estimated area of not less than 7000 square miles. The eastern or smaller Rann (about 70 miles from east to west) covers an area estimated at nearly 2000 square miles. In appearance and general character, the greater and lesser Ranns differ but little.\nThe soil is dark, and is generally caked or blistered by the action of the sun on the saline particles with which the surface is impregnated. At times, the whole surface, particularly of the eastern part of the Rann, is covered with salt. With the exception of some of the smaller islands, on which grow a few stunted bushes and grass, there is no sign of vegetable life. The wild ass roams over the Rann, finding subsistence on the grasses in the islands and at the borders. During the rains, when the whole tract is frequently inundated, a passage across is a work of great labour, and often of considerable danger. Some of this inundation is salt water, either driven by strong south winds up the Lakhpat river from the sea, or brought down by brackish streams; the rest is fresh, the drainage of the local rainfall. In spite of this yearly flooding, the bed of the Rann does not, except in a few isolated spots, become soft or slimy. The flood-waters, as they dry, leave a hard, flat surface, covered with stone, shingle, and salt. As the summer wears on, and the heat increases, the ground, baked and blistered by the sun, shines over large tracts of salt with dazzling whiteness, the distance dimmed and distorted by an increasing mirage. On some raised plots of rocky land, water is found, and only near water is there any vegetation. Except a stray bird, a herd of wild asses, or an occasional caravan, no sign of life breaks the desolate loneliness. The Eastern Rann commences to fill in March, with the south-west winds; and during the time it contains water, it is affected by the tides, and is consequently very difficult to pass, as the water is constantly in motion. It attains its usual height before a drop of rain falls, by the influx of water from the Gulf of Cutch. Unseasonable rain, or a violent south-west wind at any period, renders the greater part of the Rann impassable. It generally becomes passable by the end of October; but even then for passage by troops it is recommended that the Rann be crossed by night to avoid the glare, and working parties should be detached in advance to clear wells. The Rann is considerably higher in the centre than along the edges; while the centre, therefore, is dry, there is frequently water and mud at its sides. The little Rann is at present undergoing a marked change. Year by year the sea is spreading farther eastward; and, along the coast, places which a few years ago were inaccessible to boats are now open to water traffic. Whether this change is due to a general fall in the level of the land, has not been satisfactorily ascertained.\n\nEarthquakes.\u2014The peculiar character of these great salt wastes, and the eruptions of basalt and fire-rent cliffs along the base of the hills, mark the early force of volcanic action in Cutch. Volcanoes are no longer at work; but frequent shocks of earthquake show that this tract is still the centre of strong subterranean energy. On four occasions during the present century\u2014viz. 1819, 1844, 1845, and 1864\u2014earth-\nquake waves have crossed Cutch. The most severe were the shocks of 1819, when 7000 houses at Bh\u00faj, including the R\u00e1o's palace, were destroyed, and 1150 people buried in the ruins. Every fortified town in the State was injured, and, in the west, the fort of Ter\u00e1, considered the strongest in Cutch, was levelled with the ground. One effect of this convulsion was the fall, at several parts of its surface, of the bed of the Rann. Sinking is reported to have taken place in the east, in the north, and in the west. In the west, the change of level was most marked; for about 16 miles on either side of Sindri, a fortified custom-house on the left bank of the Kori river, the land would seem to have suddenly sunk from 8 to 12 feet, and the place has since been occupied by an inland lake or lagoon. North of Sindri, after the earthquake was over, a bank about 50 miles long and from 10 to 18 feet high, stood out from the plains which had before stretched as level as the sea. On account of its sudden appearance across the old bed of the Indus, the natives gave to this bank the name of Allah bandh, or 'God's embankment.' Early observers speak of it as an upheaval of the surface. But from the north side there is little sign of any rise in the land; and a few years after its formation (1826), the flood-waters of the Indus, keeping their former course, forced their way through the dam. These two considerations would seem to show that the apparent height of the bank, as seen from the south, is to some extent due to the fall in the level of the land in that direction.\n\nMinerals, etc.\u2014Both iron and coal are found. Iron was formerly smelted, but at present the Cutch mines remain unworked. The coal found in the Ch\u00e1rw\u00e1r Hills is of an inferior description, and has not been found worth the expenses of working. Alum and a coarse variety of saltpetre are also produced. In former times, alum was prepared in great quantities; but, partly owing to the competition of Chinese alum, and partly because Cutch alum is said to injure cloths prepared with it, the demand has of late years almost entirely ceased. The Karimori Hills furnish strong, tough millstones; and good building stone abounds in Cutch. Some of the best varieties are furnished by the lower jurassic rocks, and others much used are found in the upper tertiary beds. The yellowish marble of Kh\u00e1vda is largely found and exported. There are no forests in the State. Of large game, panthers and wild boar are to be found.\n\nPopulation and History.\u2014The population of Cutch in 1881 was 512,084 persons, inhabiting 102,007 houses; number of persons per square mile, 78\u00b773; per house, 5\u00b70. The Hindus numbered 325,478; Muhammadans, 118,797; Christians, 96; Jains, 66,663; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 42; Jews, 19; Sikhs, 30; and aborigines, 959. About 8\u00b77 per cent. of the total population are R\u00e1jputs, and 6\u00b79 per cent. Br\u00e1hmans; while the cultivating, artisan, and other lower castes of Hindus constitute about\n48 per cent. Of the R\u00e1jputs, the R\u00e1o and his Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, or 'Brethren of the Tribe,' are J\u00e1rejas. Among the land proprietors are a few W\u00e1ghela R\u00e1jputs, who reside in the cultivated spots of the arid country between Cutch and Sind. The languages of Cutch are nominally two\u2014Kachchh\u00ed (Cutch\u00ed) and Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed; the former being the colloquial dialect, but little used now in literature or business. Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed is the written language. Persian and Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed are but slightly used or known in the Province. The J\u00e1reja R\u00e1jputs, to which branch the R\u00e1o of Cutch belongs, are descended from the Summa tribe, and came originally from the north. They are said to have emigrated from Sind about the 15th century under the leadership of J\u00e1m L\u00e1kha, son of J\u00e1ra, from whom the tribe derive their name. Till 1540, the J\u00e1ms ruled over Cutch in three branches; but about that year, Kheng\u00e1r, with the assistance of the Muhammadan King of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, succeeded in making himself head of the tribe, and master of the whole Province. He also obtained from the king the grant of Morvi in the north of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, with the title of R\u00e1o. The J\u00e1m R\u00e1wal, the uncle of Kheng\u00e1r, who had, previous to the latter's accession to full power, ruled over a great part of Cutch, fled to K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and founded the present reigning house of Naw\u00e1nagar, the rulers of which are still called J\u00e1ms. For six generations from Kheng\u00e1r, the R\u00e1os succeeded according to primogeniture; but on the death of R\u00e1yadhan, his third son, Pr\u00e1gji, opened to himself a road to the throne by murder and usurpation. In order, however, to pacify the son of his murdered brother, who had a superior right to the throne, he placed him in independent charge of Morvi, which is still in the possession of his descendants. Kheng\u00e1r gave his own niece, Kam\u00e1b\u00e1i, in marriage to the King of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, and one of Kheng\u00e1r's descendants gave his daughter in marriage to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r. On the death of R\u00e1o Lakhpat, his sixteen wives burnt themselves on his funeral pile, and their tombs, built in a beautiful group, stand close to the British Residency in Cutch. The practice of female infanticide, for which the J\u00e1rejas were notorious, is said to have been introduced by the eponymous hero J\u00e1ra, who killed his seven unmarried daughters because he had failed to find any suitable matches for them.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014There is a fair proportion of good arable soil in Cutch, on which wheat and barley of indifferent quality are cultivated, as well as cotton, the ordinary varieties of millet and pulse, and a little garden produce. Irrigation is practised over a considerable area. The revenue system is the bhaghatai, or 'metayer,' and the State share is sold by auction. A high value is set upon the right of occupancy, but in gar\u00e1sia villages the cultivators are tenants-at-will. In State lands, the right of occupancy is only accorded to those who have proved themselves worthy of the concession by sinking wells, or converting dry crop into garden land. The revenue survey has been at work for several years, but\non measurement only, not on classification or assessment of the lands. Of domestic animals, the camel is the most important; the R\u00e1o possesses large herds of these animals, as well as of cows and buffaloes. Cutch has long been famous for its horses.\n\nTrade and Manufactures.\u2014Owing to the want of made roads, the country becomes almost impassable during the rainy months. But in the fair season, there is land communication northwards with the southeast Districts of Sind, with M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, with North Gujar\u00e1t, and across the Little Rann with Jhal\u00e1w\u00e1r, the north-eastern division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. The trade of Cutch is chiefly by sea. The chief imports are of raw produce\u2014grain, butter, sugar, groceries, fruit, and timber; and of manufactured articles\u2014iron, brass, and copper ware, cloth, furniture, stationery, and ivory. The exports are alum and cotton, Indian millet, pulse, and garlic, clarified butter, black coloured cloth, and silver ware. The R\u00e1jput\u00e1na Railway is said to have had an injurious effect on the trade of Cutch, as traffic is diverted to Bombay and Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed. In 1881, the imports amounted to \u00a3585,340, and the exports to \u00a3170,190. The customs dues are for the most part farmed, and in 1881 realized \u00a374,500. From M\u00e1ndvi, which is the chief port of Cutch between the middle of August and the middle of June, vessels sail to Arabia, Muscat, Sind, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay, and the Malab\u00e1r coast. A breakwater to protect the M\u00e1ndvi harbour is under construction. The Cutch sloops, called coti\u00e1s, now generally built with decks, are esteemed very good sea-boats; and the Cutch sailors, both Musalm\u00e1ns and Hindus of the Kol\u00ed caste, are equal to any to be found on the western coast of India, both in skill and daring. M\u00e1ndvi used at one time to have a close connection with Zanzibar, on the African coast, from which were imported ivory, rhinoceros hides, and slaves. The importation of slaves into Cutch was stopped in 1836. Transit duties have been abolished since 1874. As there are no forests in Cutch, timber for building purposes has to be imported. In addition to the beautiful embroidery and silver work, for which Cutch is chiefly noted, its manufactures of silk and cotton are of some importance.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The territory of Cutch has a threefold jurisdiction; the first comprises the State (Kh\u00e1lsa) portion, under the direct management of the R\u00e1o; the second, the estates of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, or cadets of the R\u00e1o\u2019s house, a body of feudal landlords; the third jurisdiction is that over seven villages in the centre of the territory, known as the Adhoi sub-division, which is held by one of the leading chiefs of the R\u00e1o\u2019s tribe, the Thak\u00far of Morvi in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. For administrative purposes the State is divided into 8 Sub-divisions, namely, Abd\u00e1sa with Nakhtar\u00e1na, Auj\u00e1r, Bhach\u00e1n, Bh\u00faj with Kh\u00e1vda, Lakhpat, M\u00e1ndvi, Mundra, and R\u00e1par with Kh\u00e1dir, each with an area of about 812 square miles, containing on an average the lands of 130 villages. Popularly,\nthe province is divided into 7 Districts. The present R\u00e1o of Cutch, who is styled Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00edrz\u00e1 Mah\u00e1 R\u00e1o Sr\u00ed Kheng\u00e1rj\u00ed, was born about 1866, and succeeded on the death of his father, R\u00e1o Pragmulj\u00ed, in 1876. He is the head of the J\u00e1reja R\u00e1jp\u00fats, whose possessions are spread over Cutch and a great part of Northern and Western K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. The present ruler is fifteenth in descent from Kheng\u00e1r. The gross revenue in 1881 was stated to be \u00a3160,305. The land revenue was formerly farmed out each year, but since the last few years it has been collected by Darbar officials, and is paid in kind, the State share being sold by auction. The Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, who form the brotherhood of the R\u00e1o, are bound to furnish troops on emergency. The number of these chiefs has been estimated at 200, and the total number of the J\u00e1reja tribe in Cutch at about 20,000 souls. There have been several dissensions between the R\u00e1o and his Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, in which the British Government has mediated. Their estates do not descend according to primogeniture, but a system of sub-division prevails. The chief of Cutch holds a patent or sanad from the British Government authorizing adoption, and in matters of succession the family follows the rule of primogeniture. The aggregate income of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d is estimated at about \u00a3150,000.\n\nA regular survey of Cutch is now being carried out, which will, when completed, form a valuable aid towards the general pacification of the country. The chief cause of British intervention has been the suppression of piracy, in which the inhabitants of W\u00e1gad, or eastern Cutch, were the chief offenders. Sat\u00ed and female infanticide were at one time very prevalent; the first has been suppressed entirely, and efforts for the suppression of the second have been attended with considerable success. In 1842, the proportion of males to females in the J\u00e1reja tribe was found to be as 8 to 1; in 1881 it stood as 2\u00b725 to 1. The proportion of males to females in the total population in 1881, was 1\u00b703 to 1.\n\nThe State is by treaty bound to defray the actual expenses of the subsidiary force, stationed in Bh\u00faj for the protection of the country, to the extent of \u00a318,695 a year. The R\u00e1o of Cutch is entitled to a salute of 17 guns. The military force consists of 240 cavalry, 404 foot soldiers, 495 Arabs, and 40 artillerymen. In addition, there are some 3000 irregular infantry, and the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d could furnish on requisition a mixed force of about 4000 men. The police force numbers 602, or 1 man to 10\u00b77 square miles, and to 850 of the population. There are 6 municipalities in the State, of which the principal are Bh\u00faj, with an income in 1882 of \u00a34160; M\u00e1ndvi, of \u00a33460; and Anj\u00e1r, of \u00a31160; average incidence of taxation, 2s. per head. The total income from the 6 municipalities in that year amounted to \u00a39990. There were, in 1881\u201382, 86 recognised schools in the State, with a total attendance of 5342 pupils. The Census Report of 1881, however, returns\n6502 boys and 419 girls as under instruction, besides 27,253 males and 1168 females as able to read and write, but not under instruction. Education is sadly neglected among the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, although the present R\u00e1o and his brother have set the young chiefs a good example in this respect; still a steady progress is observable, the number of cadets under tuition having risen from 50 to 93, while 8 J\u00e1reja girls also attend school. The education is very elementary. Total number of post-offices in the State, 38.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Lying along the parallel line of the tropic of Cancer, Cutch is almost beyond the rain-bringing influence of the south-west monsoon. The average annual rainfall at Bh\u00faj for the 21 years ending 1881, is returned at 14\u00b778 inches. During this period, the greatest amount registered in any one year was 34\u00b788 inches in 1862, and the least, 1\u00b710 inch in 1848. In 1881, the rainfall was 17\u00b791 inches, or 3\u00b713 inches above the average. Along the sea-coast, throughout the year, the climate is agreeable; and over the whole Province, for nearly nine months, it is cool and healthy. But in April and May, burning winds and dust storms prevail, and, again, during October and part of November the heat becomes excessive. In 1881, the mean temperature for the year at Bh\u00faj was 78\u00b74\u00b0 F., ranging from a maximum of 113\u00b0 in May to a minimum of 46\u00b0 in January. The prevailing diseases are malarious and rheumatic fever, ague, smallpox, measles, ringworm, guineaworm, syphilis, and dysentery.

Area, 3517 square miles; population (1881) 1,738,165. Cuttack forms the central District of the Orissa Commissionership or Division. It is bounded on the north by the Baitaran\u00ed river and Dh\u00e1mr\u00e1 estuary, which separate it from Balasor District; on the east by the Bay of Bengal; on the south by Pur\u00ed District; and on the west by the Tributary States of Orissa. The chief town, which is also the administrative head-quarters of the District and of the Orissa Division, is Cuttack City, situated at the bifurcation of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed and K\u00e1tjur\u00ed rivers.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Cuttack consists of three distinct tracts, which are continuations of three similar tracts which constitute Balasor District. The first is a marshy woodland strip along the coast, from 3 to 30 miles in breadth; the second, an intermediate arable tract of rice land in the older part of the delta; and the third, a broken hilly region, which forms the western boundary of the District. The marshy strip\nalong the coast resembles the Bengal Sundarbans as regards its swamps, dense jungle, and noxious atmosphere, but lacks the noble forest scenery of the Gangetic tract; it is intersected by innumerable streams and creeks, whose sluggish waters deposit their silt, and form morasses and quicksands. Cultivation does not begin till the limits of this dismal region are passed. The intermediate arable plains stretch inland for about 40 miles, and are intersected by several large rivers, which emerge from the western mountains, and throw out a network of branches in every direction. Their channels, after innumerable twists and interlacings, frequently rejoin the parent stream as it approaches the ocean. This arable region is rich in rice-fields, and is dotted over with magnificent banyan trees, thickets of bamboo, and fine palm and mango groves. It is the only really fertile part of the District.\n\nThe hilly frontier tract separating the settled part of Orissa from the Tributary States, consists of a series of ranges from 10 to 15 miles in length, running nearly due east and west, with thickly-wooded slopes and lovely valleys between. This region sends down to the plains large quantities of jungle products\u2014s\u00e1l and other timber, resin, lac, tasar silk, beeswax, dyes, fibres, etc. Unfortunately, the timber is small, and only valuable as fuel. In this western tract lie all the hills of the District, except a few isolated peaks near Cuttack town. None exceeds 2500 feet in height, but many of them are interesting for their shrines or their ancient forts. The chief of these are Naltigiri, with its sandal trees and Buddhist remains; Udayagiri (Sunrise Hill), with its colossal image of Buddha, sacred reservoir, and ruined temples and caves; and Assiagiri, the highest hill in the District (2500 feet), with its old mosque. The Mah\u00e1vinyaka peak in the Tributary States, visible from Cuttack, has for ages been consecrated to the worship of Siva.\n\nRivers.\u2014The conspicuous feature of Cuttack District is its rivers. These issue in three magnificent streams, by three gorges, through the mountainous frontier on the west. In the extreme north of the District, the sacred Baitaran\u00ed, the Styx of the Hindus, emerges from Keunjhar State, in which it takes its rise, and forms the boundary between Cuttack and Balasor. In the south the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, or 'Great River,' pours down upon the delta from a narrow gully at Naraj, about 7 miles west of Cuttack town. About half-way between the two, the Br\u00e1hmani enters the District. As in the case of all deltaic rivers, the beds of these great streams lie higher than the surrounding country; and the District is consequently divided into two great depressions,\u2014one lying between the Baitaran\u00ed and the Br\u00e1hmani, and the other between the Br\u00e1hmani and the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed. After innumerable bifurcations, the three rivers enter the ocean by three different mouths. The waters of the Baitaran\u00ed and Br\u00e1hmani meet before they reach the sea, and the\ncombined stream flows into the Bay of Bengal at Point Palmyras under the name of Dh\u00e1mra. The Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, or rather that portion of it which remains in Cuttack District, after many interlacings, forms two great estuaries\u2014one generally known as the Dev\u00ed, which, with its connected channel the Jotdar, enters the bay at the southeastern corner of the District; and the other, bearing the name of the parent river, the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, which empties itself into the sea at False Point, about half-way down the coast. Each of the three great rivers throws off, on its way through the District, a number of distributaries, those of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed being the most numerous and important. The chief of these offshoots of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed are the Katjuri (which again splits up into two branches, one of which is called the Dev\u00ed, while the other retains the name of Katjuri) and the Paika, from its right or south bank; and the Birupa and Chitartala (which eventually becomes the Nun), from its north bank. The Br\u00e1hmani receives, soon after its junction with the Baitarani, an important tributary, the Kharsua which rises in the Tributary States.\n\nEstuaries and Harbours.\u2014The great rivers of Cuttack thus enter the sea by three noble estuaries,\u2014the Dh\u00e1mra, Mahanadi, and Dev\u00ed,\u2014which will be fully described under their respective names. The name Dh\u00e1mra strictly applies only to the northern and more important of the two channels by which the united waters of the Baitarani, Br\u00e1hmani, and Kharsua enter the Bay of Bengal. The southern channel is the Maipar\u00e1 river, the mouth of which is obstructed by bars and a high surf. The entrance to the Dh\u00e1mra, though also difficult, has greatly improved of late years, and is well marked; the minimum reduced depth at the lowest possible tide, according to the latest survey, is 6 feet 10 inches, but during flood-tide vessels drawing as much as 18 feet pass in with safety. The port lies within the jurisdiction of Balasor District, the village of Dh\u00e1mra being situated on the north bank of the estuary. The Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed estuary has several mouths, of which the principal debouches through the shoals to the south of the lighthouse on False Point. Although for many miles up the river there is abundant depth for ships of 300 or 400 tons burthen, its mouth is blocked by a bar, which adds to the perils of shoal water the dangers incident to constant changes in the channel. A description of False Point, and a sketch of the history of the harbour and its trade, will be found in its proper place. Two separate channels lead inland from the anchorage\u2014the Jambu river on the north, and on the south the Bakud creek, a short, deep branch of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed. Unfortunately for inland navigation by ships, bars of sand intervene between the anchorage and these channels, and, except at high water, block the entrance to both. At full tide, cargo boats and steamers enter with ease. The Dev\u00ed (which, with its channel the Jotd\u00e1r, forms the last\npart of the great network of rivers into which the K\u00e1tjuri branch of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed bifurcates) enters the sea south of the boundary of Cuttack District. In this case, too, bars of sand across the mouth of the estuary render what would otherwise be an admirable harbour almost useless. Laden country boats can proceed up the river for a distance of 28 miles in the dry season; and an extensive rice trade has developed at Machhgaon, about 9 miles from its mouth. A permanent beacon has been erected at the entrance of the estuary. Several tidal creeks, generally very winding and narrow, connect False Point with the Dh\u00e1mr\u00e1 and Dev\u00ed estuaries, and are available for country boats all the year round.\n\nCanals.\u2014The great problem in Orissa is to prevent the rivers from destroying the crops during the rains, and at the same time husband and utilize them for agriculture and commerce in the dry season. The five great rivers which collect the drainage of 63,350 square miles of the hill country towards Central India dash down, in time of flood, 2,760,000 cubic feet of water per second upon the 5000 square miles of the Cuttack and Balasor delta; while, in hot weather, the supply dwindles down to 1690 cubic feet per second. To husband and control this enormous water supply, a vast system of canals was projected. An independent company (the East Indian Irrigation Company), with unguaranteed capital, undertook the execution of the necessary works for the irrigation of the Province, and its protection from floods; and in 1862, operations were commenced. An account of this great undertaking, designed to irrigate a total area of 1,600,000 acres, will be found in the article on Orissa. The region over which the operations extend reaches along the coast from the Chilka lake, in the south of Pur\u00ed District, to the Salandi (S\u00e1lnad\u00ed) river in Balasor, and is traversed by the deltaic mouths of the three Cuttack rivers and the S\u00e1land\u00ed. The company proved unable to complete their project, and Government took over their whole works from 31st December 1868. The chief canals of the system are four in number\u2014viz. (1) The High Level Canal, originally designed to provide a navigable trade route between Cuttack and Calcutta via Midnapur and Ulub\u00e1ri\u00e1; (2) the Kendrapara Canal, extending from Cuttack to M\u00e1rs\u00e1gh\u00e1i, and designed to irrigate 385 square miles of country; (3) the Taldanda Canal, connecting Cuttack city with the main branch of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed within tidal range, and intended both for navigation and irrigation; and (4) the Machhgaon Canal, connecting Cuttack with the mouth of the Dev\u00ed river. The idea of making the High Level Canal a trade route between Cuttack and Calcutta has been abandoned; and the Orissa branch is not carried beyond Balasor District. The Bengal branch, starting from Ulub\u00e1ri\u00e1, stops short at Midnapur town. A steamer traffic is now maintained by way of the canals between the\nseaboard at False Point and Cuttack Town, although the great bulk of the trade is carried on by native cargo boats.\n\n**Embankments.**\u2014It is obvious that the immense volumes of water poured down upon the comparatively small Orissa delta must spread over the country with overwhelming violence. From time immemorial, defensive embankments have existed along the banks of the rivers, but these have hitherto failed to protect the low lands lying between the various deltaic channels. In Cuttack District, 680 miles of Government and private embankments endeavour to regulate 35 rivers or distributaries; and it is recorded that between 1831 and 1867, \u00a3157,676 were spent in this District alone on the construction and repairs of these protective works. Adding the amount of revenue remitted in consequence of droughts during the same period, it has been officially estimated that the uncontrolled state of the Cuttack rivers cost during those thirty-six years a sum of \u00a3300,000. The two items for remissions of revenue and cost of protective works alone amount to an annual charge of more than 10\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) per cent. on the land revenue of the District. The great inundation of 1866 made no fewer than 413 breaches in Cuttack District, not one of the 35 embanked rivers being effectually controlled.\n\n**History.**\u2014In historical interest and administrative importance, Cuttack is by far the leading District of Orissa; and the town of the same name has continued to be the capital of the Province for the last 900 years. The District, however, has no separate history apart from that which will be found in the article on Orissa, to which the reader is referred.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The Census of 1872 disclosed a total population of 1,494,784 persons, dwelling in 5500 villages, and inhabiting 281,430 houses. The next Census, in 1881, returned the population at 1,738,165, showing an increase of 243,381, or 16.29 per cent., during the 9 years. As explained in the article on Balasor District, this large increase represents an actual advance in the numbers of a population recovering during a series of prosperous years from the devastating famine of 1866. Area of the District in 1881, 3517 square miles; number of villages or towns, 12,841; houses, 344,540, of which 316,436 were occupied and 28,104 unoccupied; average density of population, 494.22 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 3.65; houses per square mile, 97.96; persons per village, 135; persons per inhabited house, 5.49. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 849,254, and females, 888,911; proportion of males in the total population, 48.28 per cent. In religion, the population is almost entirely Hindu. The excess of females is explained by the fact that numbers of men from Cuttack District emigrate to Calcutta and other towns as palanquin-bearers, labourers, and domestic servants, leaving their wives and families behind them.\nThe Census of 1881 returned the number of Hindus at 1,687,608; Muhammadans numbered 47,259; Christians, 2331; Sikhs, 104; Buddhists, 3; Br\u00e1hmos, 3; and 'others,' 857, consisting mainly of aboriginal tribes still professing their primitive faiths. The Census Report, however, includes 58,087 other aboriginal tribes and castes, but classifies them as Hindus in religion.\n\nAmong the higher castes of Hindus are the Br\u00e1hmans, who number 177,193, and the R\u00e1jputs 10,782. Next come the Khand\u00e1its, 339,425, the most numerous caste in the District. Their name signifies 'swordsmen,' and they originally composed the ancient militia of the country, holding lands on a strictly military tenure. They are now chiefly cultivators. The Go\u00e1l\u00e1, or great pastoral caste, comes next, with 140,870; followed by the Ch\u00e1s\u00e1 or chief cultivating caste, with 103,314. Next in number come the P\u00e1ns, a degraded caste of landless day-labourers, 78,967 in number; and the Kand\u00e1ras, a cognate caste, 73,882 in number. The other Hindu castes, exceeding 10,000 in number, are represented as follows:\u2014Karan, writers and Government servants, corresponding to the K\u00e1yasths of Bengal proper, 41,761; Baniy\u00e1, traders, 32,709; S\u00fadra or Sud, a respectable caste of cultivators and domestic servants, 53,436; N\u00e1pit, barbers, 33,311; Dh\u00f3b\u00ed, washermen, 33,449; Kumbh\u00e1r, potters, 19,985; Loh\u00e1r, blacksmiths, 15,012; Kandu, sweetmeat makers, 15,754; Teli, oil-sellers and traders, 58,559; T\u00e1nti, weavers, 41,777; Barh\u00e1i, carpenters, 19,488; Keut, fishermen, 46,898; Cham\u00e1rs, skinners and shoemakers, 12,759; Baur\u00ed, labourers, 56,819. There were also 31,328 Hindus not recognising caste, of whom 29,614 were Vaishnavs. The aboriginal population returned as Hindus in the Census Report numbered 58,087, including 24,792 Gonds, 2443 Bhuiy\u00e1s, and 146 Kharw\u00e1rs. The remainder, 30,706 in number, consist of the wilder tribes, such as the Kandhs, Savars, etc., and are not returned separately in the Census Report. The vast majority of the Hindus are Vishnu-worshippers, but almost all the Br\u00e1hmans are Sivaites. The worshippers of K\u00e1l\u00ed, one of the forms of the wife of Siva, are few in number, and are principally found among the Bengali settlers. The Muhammadans are divided according to sect into\u2014Sunn\u00eds, 44,444; Shi\u00e1s, 799; Wah\u00e1b\u00eds, 2; and unspecified, 2014. Of the 2331 Christians, 278 are Europeans or Americans; 210 Eurasians; 1819 natives; and 24 unspecified. Two peasant colonies of native Christians have been founded by the Cuttack Baptist Mission\u2014one at Chhag\u00e1n, a village in Athgarh State, but within a short distance of Cuttack town, on the opposite side of the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1di; and the other at Khanditar, on the banks of the Kharsu\u00e1 river. These little colonies live entirely by agriculture; while the town Christians find employment as Government servants, or in connection with the Mission, or as domestic servants or day-labourers.\nThe occupations of the male inhabitants of the District are returned in the Census Report in 6 main divisions as follow:\u2014(1) Professional class, including Government officers, military, and the learned professions, 24,974; (2) domestic servants, hotel and lodging-house keepers, etc., 9369; (3) commercial class, including merchants, general dealers, carriers, etc., 12,161; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 265,599; (5) manufacturing, artisan, and other industrial classes, 101,923; (6) indefinite and non-productive (composed of 70,524 general labourers, 13 men of rank and property without occupation, and 364,691 unspecified, including children), 435,228.\n\nThe population of the District is almost entirely rural, only 3 towns containing upwards of 5000 souls, namely, Cuttack, 42,656; Kendrap\u00e1ra, 15,696; and J\u00e1ipur, 11,233. Of the 12,841 villages and towns, 10,360 contain less than 200 inhabitants; 2168 have from 200 to 500; 287 from 500 to 1000; 22 from 1000 to 2000; 1 from 2000 to 3000; and 3 upwards of 10,000 inhabitants.\n\nEthnically, the population consists of three races\u2014Aboriginal, Indo-Aryan or Hindu, and Afgh\u00e1n or Musalm\u00e1n. The aboriginal tribes, here as elsewhere, cling to their mountains and jungles. They chiefly consist of the Kandhs, Kols and Savars, and a brief account of them will be found in the article on the Orissa Tributary States. They are regarded by the orthodox Hindus as little higher than the beasts of the wildernesses they inhabit. Miserably poor, they subsist for the most part by selling firewood and the other products of their jungles; but a few of them have patches of cultivated land, and many earn wages as day-labourers. They form, in fact, an intermediate stage of destitution between the comparatively well-off tribes in the Tributary States (the home of these races), and the P\u00e1ns, Baur\u00eds, and Kand\u00e1ras, who now rank as the basest of the Hindu community, but who are supposed to be remnants of the pre-Aryan people, from the similarity of their habits to those of the aborigines in the Tributary States. The great bulk of the Indo-Aryan or Hindu population consists of Uriy\u00e1s, with a residue of immigrant Bengalis, L\u00e1la K\u00e1yasths from Behar and Upper India, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s from Central India, and Sikhs from the Punjab. The Musalm\u00e1n population are the descendants of the northern soldiery who swooped down upon Orissa in 1558, and during subsequent Muhammadan invasions.\n\nAgriculture, etc.\u2014The staple crop of Cuttack, in common with the other Districts of Orissa, is rice. Bi\u00e1li, corresponding to the \u00e1us or autumn rice of Bengal, is sown broadcast on high land in May, and reaped in September. A tradition relates that this rice was not created by Brahm\u00e1, the author of the universe, but invented by the Sage Visw\u00e1mitra. It is therefore considered less pure, and its use is prohibited in religious ceremonies. The s\u00e1rad rice corresponds with the\naman or winter crop of Bengal. Some of its varieties are sown on low, marshy ground; others are carefully reared in nurseries, and removed, plant by plant, to higher and drier land. All attempts to introduce Carolina seed into Cuttack District have failed, owing, it is thought, to the unsuitability of the soil. The area under rice has increased by about one-fourth during the last twenty-five years, but the productive powers of the land are said to have diminished. This is accounted for by the constant working, which allows it no rest; and rotation of crops, although known in Cuttack, is not systematically practised. Deficiency of labour is also sometimes alleged as a cause for this decrease of fertility. The large and important public works now in course of construction have, to a small extent, withdrawn hired labour from agriculture; but the demand for it has increased. The other cereals grown in the District are m\u00e1ndu\u00e1 (a grain peculiar to Orissa), wheat, barley; pulses, fibres, oil-seeds, sugar-cane, and p\u00e1n, are also produced.\n\nOf the total area of 2,469,300 acres, 1,357,990, or 55 per cent., were returned in the Statistical Reporter for October 1876 as cultivated; 242,010, or 10 per cent., as cultivable, but untilled; and 869,300 acres, or 35 per cent., as uncultivable waste. The cultivated area is thus distributed:\u2014Under rainy season crops, 1,407,890 acres; under dry season crops, 97,900 acres; total, 1,505,790 acres, including land bearing two crops in the year. Rice occupies 1,097,000 acres, or 81 per cent. of the cultivated land. The average produce of each crop per acre is thus returned:\u2014Rice, 1000 lbs.; wheat, 150; inferior food-grains, 270; cotton, 150; oil-seeds, 300; fibres, 160; sugar, 120; tobacco, 1000; vegetables, 3500 lbs. In 1882\u201383 the price of common rice was 4s. 4d. per cwt., and wheat 11s. 6\u00bdd. per cwt. The year was a very favourable one, and the crops exceptionally good. Irrigation has hitherto been conducted almost entirely by means of natural water-courses, but the artificial works now open and in progress fertilize a large proportion of the District.\n\nIn the Orissa famine of 1866, the maximum prices reached were as follows:\u2014Best cleaned rice, 3\u00bd sers per rupee, or 32s. per cwt.; coarse rice, 4 sers per rupee, or 28s. per cwt. A farm of 25 acres or upwards is considered a very large holding; one of between 10 and 25 acres, a good-sized one; and anything much below 10 acres, a small one. Every well-to-do villager has a few acres, and the standard by which a cultivator is judged is the number of ploughs he can command. This, however, is no true criterion as to the value of his farm, inasmuch as some kinds of crops, such as biali rice and sugar-cane, require much more ploughing than others. In a holding consisting of two-crop and one-crop land in fair proportions, 6 acres are technically termed a \u2018plough of land,\u2014i.e. the quantity\nwhich a husbandman with one plough and a single pair of bullocks can cultivate. A holding of 12 acres enables a Cuttack cultivator to live quite as well as a respectable shopkeeper, or as a person earning 16s. a month. His family can afford to eat more food than either of these two classes. One-half of the peasantry may be set down as really well off. One-fourth are permanently in debt to the village money-lender or the landlord. The remainder are just able to live, although a change for the better has set in in this respect, and is steadily making progress. Able-bodied pauperism is unknown, except among the religious mendicants. The District seems to be steadily progressing. Vast sums of money have been spent on irrigation works, and much of it sinks into the country. The improvement has probably affected the mercantile and labouring classes more than the actual cultivators. Wages of agricultural day-labourers are generally paid in kind, and do not seem to have altered since 1850. The rate is about 12 to 15 lbs. of unhusked rice per diem. All labour, paid by money, has risen in price. Unskilled labourers now (1883) earn from 3d. to 9d. a day, and skilled artisans in towns from 4\u00bdd. to 1s. 6d. a day. Roughly speaking, it may be said that labour fetches double in the towns what it does in the country.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The calamities of Cuttack, as of all the other Orissa Districts, are floods and droughts. The former arise from sudden freshets of the rivers before they enter the District, and not from excessive rainfall within it. Between 1830 and 1876, flood has caused a general destruction of crops in eight years out of the forty-six. For a description of the protective works of Cuttack, see the previous sections on Canals and Embankments. Drought is more disastrous than flood, and when long protracted, has always been followed by famine. On five different occasions since 1850, drought has occurred on a sufficiently large scale to endanger the safety of the people. For an account of the great famine of 1866, see ORISSA.\n\nManufactures.\u2014The manufactures of Cuttack District are insignificant. Brass vessels, brass ornaments, and coarse cloth are the chief articles made. The total annual out-turn of the cotton looms is roughly valued at \u00a330,000; the brass and copper work at \u00a36000; the oil-pressing at \u00a37600; the joiners\u2019 work at \u00a38500. Silver filigree work, the speciality of Cuttack city, is confined to a very few hands, but the work is becoming better known, and the industry is extending. The salt manufacture has greatly declined in this District. In 1875\u201376, less than 1000 tons were manufactured, against a total consumption of 7407 tons, averaging 11 lbs. per head of the population. There is a considerable iron-smelting industry in the hill country to the south of Cuttack. The total annual out-turn of iron is valued at \u00a320,000.\n\nCommerce, Trade, etc.\u2014Till within the last few years, trade hardly existed in Orissa; but the improvement of False Point Harbour has\nrecently opened a market for the surplus rice of the Province, and the sea-borne trade of Cuttack District is virtually that of False Point. During the seven years ending 1875-76, the total imports were valued at \u00a3652,800, having risen from \u00a331,000 in 1869-70 to nearly \u00a3140,000 in 1875-76. The exports in the same period aggregated \u00a3618,609, having increased from \u00a318,000 to \u00a3127,000. In 1881-82, the sea-borne imports into Cuttack amounted to \u00a384,716, and the exports to \u00a3199,389. The chief road is the Grand Trunk Road from Calcutta to Ganjam, which enters the District from Balasor. From Cuttack city a branch proceeds due south to the town of Pur\u00ed. Other important roads are those from Cuttack city to Ch\u00e1ndb\u00e1l\u00ed and Taldand\u00e1. The total length of all the means of communication was returned as follows in 1876:\u2014Rivers, 527 miles; canals, 135 miles\u2014total mileage of waterways, 662; first-class roads, 72 miles; second-class roads, 173; third-class roads, 336 miles\u2014total mileage of roads, 581. A preliminary survey for a railway to connect Benares with Cuttack has been recently carried out. Besides having a large pilgrim-passenger traffic, the railway, which would traverse Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur from north-west to south-east, would afford an outlet to the traffic of the plateau to the North-Western Provinces and to Orissa.\n\nAdministration.\u2014For 1829-30, the first year in which Cuttack District had an existence in its present circumscribed limits, as distinct from Pur\u00ed and Balasor, the gross revenue is returned at \u00a3139,642, and the gross expenditure at \u00a3114,438. In 1860-61, the gross revenue had increased to \u00a3202,867, and the disbursements to \u00a3193,882. In 1870-71, the total income realized was \u00a3243,958, and the disbursements amounted to \u00a3223,659. In 1829-30, the land yielded \u00a379,893; in 1870-71, \u00a384,781; and in 1882-83, \u00a387,482. In 1829, Cuttack District contained 1509 estates, held by 2118 proprietors; by 1870-71, the number of estates had risen to 3571, and of proprietors to 9554. In 1882-83, the separate estates on the District rent-roll numbered 3863. In 1805, when the jurisdiction of Cuttack included also the greater part of Balasor and Pur\u00ed, the land revenue of the Province amounted to \u00a3121,904, or only one-fourth more than that of the single District of Cuttack in 1882. This land revenue was paid by 2275 estates, held by 2517 owners. At the present day, Cuttack District alone contains nearly double this number of estates, and quadruple the number of proprietors. Protection to person and property has increased still more rapidly. In 1816, there were only 4 courts, revenue and judicial, in the whole District. In 1850, the number rose to 11; and in 1882-83, to 13. For police purposes, Cuttack is divided into 9 th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles. In 1881, the regular police consisted of 491 men of all ranks. The municipal force for the protection of the three municipalities of Cuttack, J\u00e1jpur,\nand Kendr\u00e1p\u00e1r\u00e1, was 86 strong. The village watch numbered 5541. The total protective machinery of the District, therefore, consisted of 6118 officers and men; equal to an average of 1 man to every '57 of a square mile as compared with the area, or 1 man to every 284 persons as compared with the population.\n\nThere are 4 prisons in Cuttack\u2014viz. the District jail at the civil station, and lock-ups at the sub-divisional towns of J\u00e1jpur and Kendr\u00e1p\u00e1r\u00e1. In 1882, the daily number of prisoners was as follows:\u2014Civil, 8\u00b718; under trial, 21\u00b742; convicts, 268\u00b783: total, 298\u00b743, of whom 15\u00b790 were females. The prison manufactures do not lessen the cost of the jails in any material degree. There is no extramural work.\n\nThe number of schools rose from 3 in 1856\u201357 to 50 in 1870\u201371, and the number of pupils from 168 to 2755 in the same period. By 1875, the number of inspected schools had further increased to 539, attended by 10,196 pupils; and by 1881\u201382 to 3804 schools, and to 40,674 pupils. These figures show 1 school to every '95 square mile of the District area, and 23\u00b74 pupils to every 1000 of the population. This rapid increase is due to the extension of the grant-in-aid rules to previously unaided institutions. The Cuttack High School includes four departments\u2014the college, the law department, medical department, and the zil\u00e1 school; the students on the rolls on the 31st of March 1882 were 38 in the college, 8 in the law class, 30 in the medical class, and 288 in the school. European and Eurasian education was afforded by 2 Roman Catholic and 2 Protestant schools, attended by 229 pupils. Many pupils in the Roman Catholic schools, however, were natives.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Orissa is the same as that of the southern Districts of Bengal. It may be divided into three seasons\u2014the hot, commencing in March; the rainy, in the middle of June; and the cold, in the beginning of November. The Meteorological Department has stations at False Point Lighthouse, and at Cuttack town. The average annual rainfall during the twelve years ending 1881 is returned at 56\u00b759 inches at Cuttack town, and 73\u00b719 inches at False Point. The average mean temperature at Cuttack town in 1881 was 80\u00b78\u00b0 F.; the maximum recorded being 106\u00b79\u00b0 in April, and the minimum 51\u00b78\u00b0 in January. At False Point, the mean temperature was 76\u00b76\u00b0 F.; maximum, 103\u00b75\u00b0 in April; minimum, 49\u00b78\u00b0 in January. Intermittent fever is common throughout the year, and cholera always breaks out in the months of June, July, and August. Measles and small-pox are also prevalent. Cattle-disease of a fatal character often breaks out in Cuttack. There are two charitable dispensaries in the District, viz. the Cuttack Hospital and the J\u00e1jpur Dispensary.

Toynbee, Esq., C.S. (Calcutta, 1873); Census Report of Bengal for 1881; Annual Administration Reports of the Government of Bengal, from 1880 to 1883.\n\nCuttack.\u2014Principal or head-quarters Sub-division of Cuttack District, containing an area of 989 square miles, with 4452 villages and towns, and 126,128 occupied houses. Situated between $20^\\circ 2' 45''$ and $20^\\circ 42' 0''$ N. lat., and between $85^\\circ 35' 0''$ and $86^\\circ 19' 0''$ E. long. Population (1881), Hindus, 635,241; Muhammadans, 26,159; Sikhs, 96; Buddhists, 3; Christians, 2052; 'others,' 4: total, 663,555, namely, 325,342 males and 338,213 females. Average density of population, 671 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 4.50; houses per square mile, 144; persons per village, 150; persons per house, 5.2. The Sub-division comprises the three police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) of Cuttack, S\u00e1l\u00edpur, and Jagatsinghpur. It contained in 1883, 9 magisterial and revenue courts, a regular police force of 369 of all ranks, besides 2997 village watchmen.\n\nCuttack (Kataka, 'The Fort').\u2014Chief town and administrative head-quarters of Cuttack District, and capital city of the Province of Orissa; situated on the peninsula formed by the bifurcation of the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1di, where it throws off the K\u00e1tj\u00far\u00ed. Lat. $20^\\circ 29' 4''$ N., long. $85^\\circ 54' 29''$ E. The city was founded about 900 years ago by one of the kings of the Long-haired or Lion dynasty, and has continued to be the seat of Government to the present day. Its position as the key of the hill territory, and as the centre of the network of the Orissa canals, gives it both military and commercial importance. At present, however, Cuttack is mainly known in the world for its beautiful filigree work in gold and silver. The town contains a population of\u2014Hindus, 33,073; Muhammadans, 7687; Christians and 'others,' 1896: total, 42,656, namely, 22,056 males and 20,600 females. Area of town site, 3112 acres. Municipal revenue (1881\u201382), \u00a33497; expenditure, \u00a33066; average rate of municipal taxation, 1s. 6d. per head of the town population. The citadel of Cuttack, known as Fort Barabati, is situated on the south bank of the K\u00e1tj\u00far\u00ed river, opposite the city. It was taken by storm by the British on the conquest of the Province, in October 1803; and is now in ruins.\n\nCutw\u00e1.\u2014Sub-division and town, Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal.\u2014See Katwa.\nDabein (Dhabein).\u2014Tidal creek in Pegu District, Pegu Division, British Burma. It runs between the Pu-zwon-daung and Pegu rivers, and is 15 feet deep at high tide at Dabein village, up to which the largest boats can ascend at all times. In the rains, the water becomes fresh, and it is navigable throughout its entire course.\n\nD\u00e1bha.\u2014Petty State of M\u00e1hi K\u00e1ntha, Bombay Presidency; population (1881) 1922; estimated area under cultivation, 5045 acres; revenue, \u00a3300. The Chief or M\u00ed\u00e1h pays an annual tribute of \u00a315 to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and \u00a35 to the Th\u00e1kur of Amaly\u00e1ra. The present ruler is a Mukw\u00e1na Koli, converted to Isl\u00e1m. He has no sanad authorizing adoption; the family follows the rule of primogeniture. Transit duties are levied in the State. The religion of the M\u00ed\u00e1hs of D\u00e1bha is a mixture of Muhammadanism and Hinduism; they give their daughters in marriage to Muhammadans of rank, and marry the daughters of Kol\u00ed chiefs. They burn their dead.\n\nD\u00e1bha.\u2014Town in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces. Lat. 19\u00b0 38' N., long. 79\u00b0 42' E. Manufactures\u2014tasar silk handkerchiefs, coloured cloths, and silver snuff-boxes. Handsome woollen rugs were formerly also made, but this industry has now died out. Small local trade, principally in cotton cloths, groceries, and salt. Until the British occupation, D\u00e1bha was subject to the raids of the wild tribes across the Wardh\u00e1, and even now the shopkeepers are afraid to expose their goods. Population (1881) 2036. Government school for boys, girls\u2019 school, police station-house, and District post-office. The population is almost wholly Telugu.\n\nDabhoi.\u2014Town in the territory of the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency; 15 miles s.e. of Baroda. Lat. 20\u00b0 10' N., long. 73\u00b0 28' E.; population (1881) 14,925, namely, males 7656, and females 7269. Contains a customs house, police lines, a travellers\u2019 bungalow, a railway station, a dispensary, a jail, several schools, and a cotton ginning factory. Dabhoi is connected by railway with Miag\u00e1m, Baroda, and Chandod. One-third of the population is composed of Muhammadans. In the town is a place called m\u00e1madokri, where stands a khirni or musk-melon tree, through whose hollow trunk no guilty person can pass. Dabhoi is the Sanskrit Dh\u00e1rdbhavati of the 11th century, famous for its ancient fortress, and the beauty of its walls and gates.\n\nD\u00e1bhol.\u2014Town and port in Ratn\u00e1giri District, Bombay Presidency. Of considerable historical importance, and the principal port of the South Konkan in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries, carrying on an extensive trade with Persia and the Red Sea ports. Also noted for its\nbeautiful mosque, which is the only specimen of pure Saracenic architecture in the Southern Konkan. D\u00e1bhol was the capital of a province of the Bij\u00e1pur kingdom under Yusaf Adil Sh\u00e1h, which extended from the S\u00e1vitri river to Deogarh, including nearly the whole of the present District of Ratn\u00e1giri.\n\n**Dabka.**\u2014Village in Baroda State, Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency. Population (1881) 2823. Situated on the left bank of the Mahi river; 18 miles from Baroda. Noted on account of the deer and boar preserves in the neighbourhood. Contains a police station and school, and a couple of bungalows which are placed at the disposal of British officers who may accompany the Ga\u00e9kw\u00e1r on his hunting expeditions.\n\n**Dabla.**\u2014Town in Udaipur (Oodeypore) Native State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Originally a sub-fief of Bunera, but confiscated by the R\u00e1n\u00e1, on his feudatory th\u00e1kur becoming insubordinate, and refusing to pay the quit-rent.\n\n**D\u00e1bling.**\u2014Village in Bashahr State, Punjab; situated in lat. 31\u00b0 45' N., and long. 78\u00b0 39' E., on a belt of arable land near the left bank of the Sutlej (Satlej). The cliffs on the opposite side of the river rise to a sheer elevation of 6000 or 7000 feet. The population have the Chinese type of physiognomy, and profess the Buddhist faith. A mile east stands another village, known as D\u00fabling; the path between the two places is rendered practicable by means of hanging balconies or wooden scaffolds fastened against the face of the precipice. The two villages generally bear the joint appellation of D\u00e1bling-D\u00fabling. Elevation above sea level, 9400 feet.\n\n**D\u00e1bri.**\u2014A guaranteed Th\u00e1kurate or petty chiefship of the Western Malw\u00e1 Agency of Central India. Receives \u00a318 per annum from Sindhia on Haveli Ujain and on P\u00e1n Bah\u00e1r.\n\n**Dabtura.**\u2014Village in Bisauli tahsil, Bud\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces, 24 miles distant from Bud\u00e1un town; only noticeable as being a station on the Chandausi and Bareli branch of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway.\n\n**Dacca (Dh\u00e1k\u00e1).**\u2014Division or Commissionership of Eastern Bengal, lying between lat. 21\u00b0 48' and 25\u00b0 26' N., and between long. 89\u00b0 20' and 91\u00b0 18' E. Bounded on the north by the G\u00e1ro Hills; on the east by Sylhet District, Tipperah, and No\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed; on the south by the Bay of Bengal; and on the west by Khuln\u00e1, Jesscr, Pabn\u00e1, Bogr\u00e1, and Rangpur Districts. Dacca Division comprises the four Districts of Dacca, Far\u00eddpur, B\u00e1karganj, and Maimansingh. Area, according to the Census of 1881, 15,000 square miles, containing 28,022 towns and villages, and 1,207,908 houses, of which 1,158,903 were occupied and 49,005 unoccupied. The population in 1881 numbered 8,700,939, against 7,591,768 on a corresponding area in 1872, showing an increase of\n1,109,171, or 14'61 per cent., in the nine years between the two Censuses. Number of males in 1881, 4,366,728; females, 4,334,211; average density of population, 580 persons per square mile; number of villages per square mile, 1'87; inhabitants per town or village, 310; houses per square mile, 80'5; inmates per house, 7'5. According to religious classification, the Muhammadans formed the majority of the population, numbering 5,531,869 against 3,122,624 Hindus. Other religions were represented as follows:\u2014Christians, 15,408; Buddhists, 4859; Br\u00e1hmos, 131; Jew, 1; and 'others,' nearly all tribes professing aboriginal faiths, and confined to Maimansingh District, 26,047.\n\n**Dacca (Dh\u00e1k\u00e1, derived either from the dh\u00e1k tree (Butea frondosa) or from Dh\u00e1kesw\u00e1ri, 'the concealed goddess').**\u2014District of Eastern Bengal, situated at the junction of the river systems of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, between 23\u00b0 6' 30\" and 24\u00b0 20' 12\" N. lat., and between 89\u00b0 47' 50\" and 91\u00b0 1' 10\" E. long. Bounded on the north by the District of Maimansingh; east by Tipperah; south and south-west by B\u00e1karganj and Far\u00eddpur; and west, for a short distance, by Pabn\u00e1. To a great extent, rivers form the natural boundaries: on the east, the Meghn\u00e1; south and south-west, the Padma, or main stream of the Ganges; and west, the Jamun\u00e1, or present channel of the Brahmaputra. The District contained (1881) an area of 2797 square miles, and a population of 2,116,350 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at Dacca City.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Dacca consists of a level plain divided into two parts by the Dhaleswar\u00ed river, which intersects the District from east to west, varying considerably in their physical aspects. The northern part is again sub-divided by the Lakhmi\u00e1 river, which crossed it from north to south. The western of these two divisions contains the city, and is the larger of the two. The greater part of it lies comparatively high and above flood level, the soil consisting of red kankar with a strata of clay in the more elevated parts, covered by a thin layer of vegetable mould, and near the banks of the rivers and streams by alluvial earth. At some points, the scenery on the river Lakhmi\u00e1 is very beautiful, the banks being high and well wooded. About twenty miles north of the city, small hilly ridges are met with in the Madhupur jungle adjoining Maimansingh. They are mere mounds, or tilds, never more than 30 or 40 feet high, some being covered with grasses and underwood, and others with forest. This tract of country is remarkable for the small size of the streams by which it is watered, and the greater part is an unproductive waste covered with jungle and infested with wild beasts. Of late years, cultivation has been extended in this direction, but very slowly, owing to the badness of the water. Towards the city, the red soil is intersected by creeks and morasses, the borders of which are well suited for the cultivation of rice, mustard, and til seed; while to the\neastward of the city, a broad, alluvial, well cultivated plain extends as far as the junction of the Dhaleswari and Lakhmi\u00e1 rivers. The north-eastern division is situated between the Lakhmi\u00e1 and Meghn\u00e1 rivers. It is inundated to a larger extent, and has a much greater area of alluvial soil, and is in a higher state of cultivation than the tract to the westward. The division of the District to the south of the Dhaleswari is by far the most fertile tract. The whole is one uniform level of rich alluvial soil annually inundated by the overflow of the great rivers, to a depth varying from two to fourteen feet. The villages are built upon mounds of earth, artificially raised above flood level. During the rainy season this tract presents the appearance of a vast sheet of green rice cultivation, through which boats sail to and fro; diversified of late years by fields of jute, the cultivation of which is rapidly extending.\n\nThe District is intersected by a complete network of rivers and streams, and the chief means of communication at all times of the year is by water. Besides the great bordering rivers of the Ganges or Padm\u00e1, the Jamun\u00e1 or Brahmaputra, and the Meghn\u00e1, the following seven streams are navigable by boats of large tonnage:\u2014(1) Ari\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n, (2) Kirtin\u00e1s\u00e1, (3) Dhaleswari, (4) Bur\u00edgang\u00e1, (5) Lakhmi\u00e1, (6) Mendikh\u00e1l\u00ed, and (7) Gh\u00e1zikh\u00e1l\u00ed. Many of these represent old channels or offshoots of the great rivers; and the southern half of the District is everywhere liable to annual changes of configuration, due to constant fluvial action. The most important of the smaller rivers, which are all navigable by boats of two tons burthen, are\u2014(1) Hils\u00e1m\u00e1rfi, (2) Bans\u00ed, (3) Tur\u00e1g, (4) Tung\u00ed, (5) Bal\u00fa, and (6) the old bed of the Brahmaputra. The banks of all the above rivers are cultivated, with the exception of a small tract along the Lakhmi\u00e1 river, and all are more or less affected by the tide, which rises and falls to the extent of two feet at the town of Dacca on the Bur\u00edgang\u00e1. Numerous marshes have been formed by changes in the courses of the rivers, and are covered with rank vegetation. Several artificial watercourses or kh\u00e1ls have been constructed as short cuts to facilitate cross communications between the rivers. The drainage of the District runs from north-west to south-east, the usual course of the rivers. All the latter take their exit in the extreme south-east of the District, at the point of junction of the two great rivers the Ganges and Meghn\u00e1, into which the other streams of the District flow. With the exception of some wild herbs and water plants, no indigenous vegetable products of marketable value are found. There are no forests of any considerable extent, and most of the wooded land in the Madhupur jungle is so badly provided with means of communication as to be almost valueless. Nor is there any wide extent of uncultivated pasture ground, although many people send their cattle for a few months in the rainy season to the Madhupur jungle for pasturage. The fisheries of the District are estimated to yield\naltogether about \u00a310,000 a year. The wild animals generally are of the same species as those found in the other parts of the Gangetic delta.\n\n**History.**\u2014The historical interest of the District centres round Dacca city, an olden capital of the Muhammadan Mughals in Bengal, and, until recent times, the industrial centre of the Province. Here, as elsewhere throughout Bengal, authentic history begins with the Musalm\u00e1n chronicles; but many local legends and crumbling ruins bear witness to the power of pre-historic Hindu rulers. This tract of country formed the easternmost District of Bengal, according to the natural limitations of the Province. On the north, rise the broken hills and thick jungles of Maimansingh, into which Hindu civilisation has but recently penetrated. Eastwards, the broad stream of the Meghn\u00e1 always served as a barrier against the wild aboriginal races, whose names are preserved in the dynasties of Tipperah and Cachar. Before the invasion of the Muhammadans, only part of Dacca appears to have been included within the Hindu kingdom of Bengal. The course of the river Dhaleswar\u00ed, which marks off the alluvial delta of the Ganges from the highlands of Maimansingh, then served also as a political boundary. To the south of this river, the mythical monarch Vikram\u00e1ditya is said to have held sway, and his name is traced in the present *pargan\u00e1* of Bikr\u00e1mpur. The dynasty of Vikram\u00e1ditya was succeeded by that of Adisur, and the last authentic Hindu occupant of the throne was Ball\u00e1l Sen, whose connection with Bikr\u00e1mpur is proved by contemporary inscriptions. All these names are the common property of Bengali legend throughout the Province. The tract north of the Dhaleswar\u00ed supplies traditions with a more distinct local colouring. Here was the home of the Bhuiy\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1s, as they are called, the founders of a dynasty which bore the family name of P\u00e1l, and are supposed to have professed the Buddhist faith. The ruins of the capitals and palaces of these Bhuiy\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1s lie scattered throughout Eastern Bengal, along the line of the Brahmaputra valley; and their memory is still cherished in the household tales of the Hindu peasantry. In the portion of Dacca District lying north of the Dhaleswar\u00ed, extensive earthworks and mounds of brick associated with their name are to be seen to this day at Madhabpur, S\u00e1bh\u00e1r, and Durdur\u00eda.\n\nThe Muhammadans first entered Bengal in 1203 A.D., but the eastern Districts were not conquered until a century later. The present District of Dacca was annexed to the Afgh\u00e1n kingdom of Gaur by Muhammad Tughlak about 1325, under the name of Sonargaon, which town long remained the frontier fortress of the Muhammadans and the terminus of their grand trunk road. The rise of Dacca city dates from the beginning of the 17th century, when Isl\u00e1m Kh\u00e1n, the Mughal Viceroy, transferred the seat of Government from R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l to Dacca. This change was dictated by military considerations. The valley of the\nGanges then enjoyed peace, but the eastern frontier of the Province was exposed to the ravages of numerous warlike invaders. From the north, the dreaded Ahams or Assamese; from the south, the Maghs or Arakanese, in alliance with the merciless Portuguese pirates, harried the country, and rendered all the waterways unsafe. The Mughal Viceroys protected their frontier by maintaining a powerful fleet, and distributing colonies of veterans on feudal holdings throughout the country. Both these features of their political system have left traces in the land tenures that exist at the present day. Except during an interval of twenty years, when Muhammad Shuj\u00e1 moved the administration back again to R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l, Dacca was the capital of Bengal during the whole of the 17th century. In the long list of Naw\u00e1bs, the two most celebrated are M\u00edr Juml\u00e1, the general of Aurangzeb, who failed disastrously in his expedition into Assam; and Sh\u00e1\u00edst\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, the nephew of the Empress N\u00far Jah\u00e1n, who broke the power of the Portuguese, and annexed Chittagong to the Mughal Empire. Both these Naw\u00e1bs are also known for their encouragement of architecture, and for the construction of public works. This was the most flourishing era in the history of Dacca, for, like all eastern cities, its glory depended upon the presence of a luxurious court. It is said that the suburbs extended northwards for a distance of 15 miles, now buried in dense jungle. Portuguese mercenaries, and Armenian and Greek merchants, settled at Dacca from an early date. The English, the French, and the Dutch established factories about the middle of the 16th century, when the city was visited by the French traveller Tavernier. He describes all the wealth of Bengal, the richest Province of the Delhi Emperor, as concentrated in this spot. The muslins of Dacca became famous in Europe, and the hereditary skill of the weaving castes has not yet become extinct. Vide DACCA CITY.\n\nThe downfall of Dacca dates from the beginning of the 18th century. In 1704, Murshid Kul\u00ed Kh\u00e1n transferred the seat of government to Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d on the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed, and the short-lived prosperity followed the movement of the court. Dacca continued to be governed by a n\u00e1ib or naw\u00e1b, a deputy of the Viceroy at Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, whose appointment was regarded as the most valuable in Bengal, having a jurisdiction considerably more extensive than the area of the present Dacca Division. On the establishment of the British power in 1757, the office of n\u00e1ib became an empty title, but it was continued in the family of the last representative until 1845; and even to the present day, small pensions are paid by Government on this account. The decline of the weaving industry of Dacca began with the present century. Prior to 1801, the East India Company and private traders are said to have made advances for Dacca muslins to the annual amount of 25 l\u00f3khs of rupees (\u00a3250,000). In 1813, the investments of private\ntraders did not exceed \u00a321,000, and the Commercial Residency of the Company was discontinued altogether in 1817. The only event of importance in the recent history of Dacca District is connected with the Mutiny of 1857. Two companies of sepoys were then stationed in the fort. On the first alarm of the outbreak at Meerut, a force of 100 men of the Indian Navy was despatched from Calcutta for the protection of the city. With these sailors, and about 60 civilian volunteers, it was resolved to disarm the sepoys, who offered a violent resistance, and were only dispersed after a sharp struggle, in which 41 rebels were killed on the field, and a number of others drowned in the river or shot down in their flight. Some of the mutineers are supposed to have escaped into the jungles of Bhutan.\n\nPopulation.\u2014No trustworthy estimates of the population in early times exist. In 1851, the total number was returned at 600,000, and in 1868 the official estimate was 1,000,000. The first regular Census was taken in January 1872. The result disclosed a total population of 1,852,993 persons, dwelling in 5016 villages, and in 290,593 houses, over an area as at present of 2797 square miles. The last Census in 1881 returned the population at 2,116,350, showing an increase of 263,357, or of 14\u00b721 per cent., in the nine years. The Census Report states that this advance is to be attributed to natural causes, aided by the great development of the jute trade, which is centred in the town of Narainganj, the head-quarters of the Sub-division of the same name, in which the largest increase of population is found. The general results arrived at by the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 2797 square miles; number of towns and villages, 6422; number of houses, 319,982, of which 308,695 were occupied and 11,287 unoccupied. The population numbered 2,116,350, namely, 1,033,863 males and 1,082,487 females. Average density of population, 756\u00b76 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 2\u00b73; persons per town or village, 329; houses per square mile, 114; persons per occupied house, 6\u00b786. Classified according to religious belief, the population was returned as follows:\u2014Muhammadans, 1,250,687, or 59 per cent.; Hindus, 856,680, or 40 per cent. The remainder consisted of 8799 Christians, 49 Buddhists, 43 Brahmos, 2 Santals, and 90 \u2018others.\u2019 As throughout the rest of Eastern Bengal, the majority of the population are of semi-aboriginal descent, including the great mass of the Muhammadans, who constitute a very important element of the community, in rank as well as in numbers. The great majority belong to the Sunni sect. The few Shi\u00e1s to be found are descendants of the Mughal conquerors. The festival of the Muharram is celebrated in Dacca city with great pomp and enthusiasm, and police measures have occasionally to be adopted to prevent an outbreak between these two rival sects. In recent years, the\nreforming faith of the Far\u00e1iz\u00eds has spread rapidly through the District. (See Faridpur District.) Its members are intolerant, but not actively fanatical. Many of them are engaged in trade, dealing in rice, jute, hides, and tobacco. In clan or race distinction the Muhammadans are almost all Shaikhs; the Sayyids, Mughals, and Path\u00e1ns being few in number. The latter were, however, at one time numerous in the District, and a few of their descendants are still to be met with at the village of Path\u00e1nt\u00e1l\u00ed, near Dh\u00e1mr\u00e1i. During the Muhammadan supremacy, large numbers of Hindu inhabitants of the District were converted to Isl\u00e1m, either willingly or through coercion. The Musalm\u00e1n religion is not now an actively proselytising one in Dacca District, although it from time to time receives small additions from the Hindu and Vaishnav communities. The aborigines proper are very poorly represented, being chiefly composed of the gipsy tribe of Nats. Among the semi-Hinduized aborigines, the great tribe of Chand\u00e1ls numbers 202,510, and the Koch 13,498. Of the Hindus proper, the following are the principal castes:\u2014Br\u00e1hman, 60,542, including many Kulin families; K\u00e1yasth, or clerks by hereditary occupation, 92,909. The most numerous of the other recognised castes are\u2014Baniy\u00e1, traders, 14,971; Barhai, carpenters, 15,336; Barui, growers of p\u00e1n and betel leaf, 17,524; Dhob\u00ed, washermen, 11,028; Go\u00e1l\u00e1, milkmen and herdsmen 25,327; Jaliy\u00e1, fishermen, 39,274; Jug\u00ed, weavers, 17,080; Kaibartta, cultivators and fishermen, 40,422; Loh\u00e1r, blacksmiths, 16,747; Kap\u00e1li, weavers, 18,585; Kumbh\u00e1r, potters, 17,015; N\u00e1pit, barbers, 21,905; S\u00fadra, the highest class of cultivators, 17,392; S\u00fanri, merchants and wine-sellers, 57,917; Tel\u00ed, traders and oil-pressers, 15,966. Among caste-rejecting Hindus, the Vaishnav sect numbers 17,239 members. The Br\u00e1hma Sam\u00e1j was first established in Dacca city in 1846. The society now possesses a large hall, erected by public contributions, in which meetings are held every week. There are about 100 regular subscribers, and at least 1000 sympathizers, throughout the District. Only 43 professing Br\u00e1hm\u00f3s were, however, returned separately as such in the Census Report. The Christians of Dacca, numbering 8799 of all races and sects, are a motley race. They include Portuguese half-castes, Armenians, Greeks, and native converts, as well as the Europeans. The Portuguese mixed breeds, or Firingh\u00eds, are scattered in little communities throughout the District. Most of them are cultivators, but many engage in domestic service. In religious matters they are subject to the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Goa. The native converts or their descendants, numbering 7710 persons, are principally either Roman Catholics, under the charge of a mission sent direct from the Propaganda at Rome, numbering 3987 adherents; or Baptists, under the charge of an active mission which in 1881 numbered 4319 followers. Both the Armenians and\nthe Greeks are said to be now declining in numbers and social position.\n\nAccording to the Census of 1881, the following are the only 7 towns, or collections of villages, containing upwards of 5000 inhabitants, namely, DACCA CITY, population 79,076; NARAINGANJ, with MADANGANJ, 12,508; MANIKGANJ, 11,289; CHARJAJIRA, 7647; SHOLAGARH, 6079; KAMARGAON, 5770; and NARISHA, 6377. Total of these 7 towns, 128,646, leaving 1,987,604 as the rural population. The first three named towns have been constituted municipalities, with a total income in 1881-82 of \u00a312,863, and an expenditure of \u00a313,898; average incidence of taxation, 2s. 1\u00bdd. per head of the population living within municipal limits. The 6422 towns and villages in the District are classified as follows:\u20143405 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 1917 contain from two to five hundred; 805 from five hundred to a thousand; 238 from one to two thousand; 40 from two to three thousand; 10 from three to five thousand; 4 from five to ten thousand; 2 from ten to fifteen thousand; and 1 upwards of fifty thousand inhabitants. DACCA CITY will be fully described in a succeeding article. The chief mart in the District is NARAINGANJ, in conjunction with its suburb of Madanganj on the opposite side of the Lakhmi\u00e1 river, which is rapidly taking its stand as one of the most important trade centres of Eastern Bengal. Apart from that caused by the increasing importance of river traffic, the people show no tendency to gather into towns, but rather the reverse. Manufacturing industry can hardly be said to exist. The following places deserve mention as sites of interest:\u2014SONARGAON, the first Muhammadan capital of Eastern Bengal; FIRINGHI BAZAR, the earliest settlement of the Portuguese; BIKRAMPUR, the capital of the mythical monarch Vikram\u00e1ditya, and his successors on the throne of Bengal; SABHAR and DURDURIA, both containing ruins of palaces ascribed to the Bhuiy\u00e1 or P\u00e1l R\u00e1j\u00e1s. Many earthworks and ruins of Hindu or Musalm\u00e1n construction are scattered through the District.\n\nThe Material Condition of the People has much improved of late years, and particularly that of the cultivating classes. This is partly owing to the increased prices of produce, but is also very greatly due to the increase in the cultivation of more valuable crops, especially of jute, safflower, and oil-seeds. The only persons who do not share in the general increased prosperity are those with fixed incomes, such as subordinate landlords (t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs), Government servants, and minor officials. As regards occupation, the Census Report of 1881 classifies the male population into the following six main classes:\u2014Class (1) Professional, including Government officials, police and military, 23,391; (2) Domestic service, including hotel and lodging-house keepers, 29,777; (3) Commercial, including merchants, traders, carriers, messengers, etc., 53,532;\n(4) Agricultural, including cultivators, gardeners, herdsmen, and others engaged about animals, 412,269; (5) Manufactures and industries, 81,646; (6) Indefinite and unproductive (composed of 22,239 general labourers, and 411,009 male children and persons of no specified occupation), 433,248.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014As elsewhere throughout Bengal, the staple food crop is rice, which is divided into four varieties\u2014(1) the \u00e1man, or cold weather crop, which yields by far the largest portion of the food supply, sown on low-lying lands about April, and reaped in December; (2) the \u00e1us, or autumn crop, sown on comparatively high lands, about the same time as \u00e1man, and reaped in July and August; (3) the bora or rop\u00e1 sown in marshy ground about January, subsequently transplanted, and reaped in May; (4) the uri or jar\u00e1 dh\u00e1n, an indigenous variety found growing wild in the marshes, which is used as food by the poor. No improvement has recently taken place in the cultivation of rice, and sufficient is not grown to satisfy the local demand. Other crops include millets, pulses, oil-seeds, jute (the cultivation of which has greatly extended of late years), cotton, safflower, p\u00e1n leaf, areca-nut, cocoa-nut, and sugar-cane. The cultivation of cotton has fallen off, but the fibre produced is said to be of excellent quality. The chief staples of export are jute, oil-seeds, and safflower, all of which are being more extensively grown year by year. Manure is not generally used, and never for rice land. Irrigation is sometimes practised in the north of the District; and, in the same tract, fields are occasionally suffered to lie fallow. In the south, the land is under continuous cultivation with the same crops, and the cultivators trust to the deposit left by the annual inundation to maintain the fertility of their fields. About two-thirds of the total area of the District is estimated to be under cultivation. The out-turn of rice varies from 13 cwts. to 26 cwts. per acre. The best rice lands yield a second crop of oil-seeds or pulses. The out-turn of jute is about 17 cwts. per acre. The cultivators, as a class, are described as fairly prosperous. Comparatively few of them have obtained rights of occupancy; but the recent rise in the value of all agricultural products, caused by the development of trade, has distinctly raised the standard of comfort among them. Rates of rent for rice land vary from 1s. 10d. per acre for boro to 9s. per acre for \u00e1man land. Land that produces two crops sometimes rents at as much as 12s. an acre. As compared with the neighbouring Districts, Dacca has few great landlords, and sub-infeudation has not been carried to an excessive extent. There are seldom more than two classes of intermediate tenure-holders between the zamind\u00e1r and the actual cultivator. In the majority of cases, the landowner collects his rents by the agency of his own servants, and not through the intervention of a farmer. Spare land at the present day is only to be found in the hilly, broken\ntract in the north of the District, where the aboriginal tribes are gradually extending the limit of cultivation.\n\nDacca District is not specially subject to natural calamities, such as flood, blight, or drought. Each of these does occasionally happen, but rarely on such a scale as to affect the general harvest. In the year 1777-78, a terrible inundation occurred, succeeded by a calamitous famine. But, in more recent times, the drought of 1865 and the flood of 1870 merely raised the prices of grain, and did not produce acute distress. If the price of rice at the beginning of the year were to rise to 10s. per cwt., that should be regarded as a sign of approaching scarcity. At the present time the means of communication with other Districts by water are so good, and the ordinary course of trade is so active, that importation could at any time prevent scarcity from growing into famine. There is no demand for either embankments or canals.\n\nIndustrial.\u2014The chief means of communication are by water. The rivers are crowded by native craft and by steamers at all seasons of the year, and no corner of the District is remote from some navigable channel. The principal road, the only one under the Public Works Department, leads from Dacca city through Tipperah to Chittagong. A second important road runs northward through the high country to Maimansingh. A line of railway from Dacca to Maimansingh has been sanctioned, and is now (1884) in course of construction, and will shortly be continued to Chittagong, via N\u00e1r\u00e1\u00ednganj, crossing the Meghn\u00e1 by means of a steam ferry. The only road that carries much traffic is the branch from Dacca city to the port of N\u00e1r\u00e1\u00ednganj, which is metalled. There are two short navigable canals, only open during the rainy season. The principal manufactures are cotton-weaving, embroidery, silver-work, shell-carving, and pottery. The muslins of Dacca, once so celebrated, have now almost entirely ceased to be made. A few pieces are occasionally woven to order, to satisfy the taste of the curious. Coarse cotton cloth is still woven all over the District. The gold and silver smiths and the shell-carvers work in their own houses, and on their own account; and their condition is decidedly prosperous. The weavers and embroiderers, on the other hand, manufacture their goods on behalf of merchants, working on a system of advances. The merchants take care that the artisan shall always continue in their debt.\n\nDacca conducts a very large trade by water, and many of the merchants push their enterprise into remote countries. Europeans, Armenians, Muhammadans, and M\u00e1rw\u00e1r\u00eds maintain a brisk competition with each other. In former times, the export of manufactured cotton goods was by far the most important branch of trade. The two largest marts of commerce are Dacca city and the rapidly rising mart of N\u00e1r\u00e1\u00ednganj, with its suburb of Madanganj. A commercial fair is\nannually held at Munshiganj, lasting for three weeks, which is attended by merchants from such distant quarters as Delhi, Amritsar, and Arakan. According to the registered statistics of river traffic for the year 1876-77, the total value of the exports from Dacca District was \u00a31,944,000, including\u2014jute, \u00a3742,000; rice, \u00a3232,000; hides, \u00a3131,000; oil-seeds, \u00a351,000; spices, \u00a346,000; betel-nuts, \u00a339,000; safflower, \u00a319,000. The total value of the imports was \u00a33,245,000, the chief items being\u2014piece-goods, \u00a3795,000; salt, \u00a3304,000; food grains, \u00a3366,000; tobacco, \u00a3169,000; sugar, \u00a3255,000; timber, \u00a3135,000. No later District trade statistics are available, as since 1878 the system of collection of statistics for the internal trade of Bengal has been altered, and is now limited to the registration of the trade of the ports of Calcutta, Chittagong, and Orissa, and of that carried on along the chief railway, river, and canal routes.\n\nIn 1882 there were six printing-presses in the District, and six or eight newspapers or periodicals are published regularly. There are about forty native societies organized for the spread of education and for charitable objects, besides \u2018The Dacca Institute,\u2019 common to natives and Europeans.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1870-71, the total revenue of Dacca District was \u00a3111,620, of which \u00a353,671 was derived from the land; the total expenditure was \u00a350,631, or less than half the revenue. In 1881-82, the total revenue, Imperial, local, and municipal, amounted to \u00a3149,320, of which \u00a349,312 was derived from the land, \u00a322,592 from excise, and \u00a357,053 from stamps. The cost of civil administration, as represented by the pay of officials and police of all kinds, was \u00a346,502. In the same year, the regular police force numbered 412 officers and men, maintained at a total cost of \u00a39077. In addition, the village watch numbered 3479 men, who received from the villagers and Government rent-free lands or money estimated at \u00a314,917; and the municipal police consisted of a force of 277 officers and men, maintained at a cost of \u00a32425. The total force, therefore, for the protection of person and property amounted to 4168 men, or 1 man to every 0.6 square miles, or to every 507 of the population; the total cost was \u00a326,419, being an average of \u00a39, 8s. 10d. per square mile, and 3d. per head of population. In 1881-82, the average daily number of prisoners in the District jail was 723, of whom 8 were females; in the subsidiary jail of Munshiganj, the daily average prison population was 6, and in that of M\u00e1nikganj, 5; total daily average of prisoners, 784, or 1 to every 2828 of the population.\n\nEducation has made rapid progress in recent years. In 1860-61, there were altogether 21 schools in the District, attended by 2003 pupils. By 1876-71, the number of schools had risen to 149, and the number of pupils to 7155. Sir G. Campbell\u2019s reforms, by which the\nbenefit of the grant-in-aid rules was extended to the village schools or p\u0101ths\u0101l\u0101s, has greatly promoted primary instruction. In 1874\u201375, the number of schools had further increased to 416, and the number of pupils to 17,937, and in 1881\u201382 to 990 educational institutions under Government inspection, attended by 27,000 pupils. The great increase has been in the lower primary schools, which in March 1882 numbered 913 out of the 990 Government schools, with 23,849 out of the 27,000 pupils. Besides these State-inspected schools, the Education Department returns 286 unaided indigenous schools, with 3558 pupils, making a total of 1276 schools attended by about 30,000 pupils. The chief educational institution is the Dacca College, originally started in 1835, attended in 1882 by 290 students, and taught by a staff of six professors and lecturers. Special classes for law, medicine, and surveying are affiliated to the College; to which is also attached the District Collegiate or High School, attended in 1882 by 521 pupils. Female education is afforded in 26 schools, of which the most important is the Eden School in Dacca city, with an attendance in 1882 of 199 girls. A Normal Training School for Masters had 64 students. For the special necessities of the Muhammadans, a Madr\u0101sa or Muhammadan College had 332 pupils, of whom 113 were in the Arabic, and 219 in the English department.\n\nFor administrative purposes, Dacca District is divided into 4 Sub-divisions, and into 12 th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles, as follows:\u2014(1) Dacca or head-quarters Sub-division, comprising the police circles of Lalb\u0101gh, Kap\u00e1sia, Sabhar, and Naw\u00e1bganj; (2) N\u00e1r\u00e1inganj, comprising the police circles of N\u00e1r\u00e1inganj, R\u00fapganj, and R\u00e1ipura; (3) M\u00e1nikganj, comprising the police circles of M\u00e1nikganj, Jafarganj, and Harir\u00e1mpur; and (4) Munshiganj, comprising the police circles of Munshiganj and Srinagar. The number of pargan\u00e1s or fiscal divisions is 182. In the year 1883, there were 11 magisterial and 15 civil and revenue courts open; the number of European covenanted officers stationed in the District was 4.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Dacca during the hot months is sensibly cooled by the circumstance that the wind has passed over the wide surface of large rivers. The rainy season lasts from April to October. The most disagreeable weather in the year is experienced at the close of this season. The average rainfall for thirty years ending 1881 was 74\u00b773 inches. The rainfall in 1881 was 79\u00b706 inches, or 4\u00b733 inches above the average. The average mean temperature in 1881 was 78\u00b78\u00b0 F., the maximum being 99\u00b75\u00b0 in April, and the minimum 48\u00b72\u00b0 in January. Earthquakes are of common occurrence. Specially severe shocks were experienced in April 1762, April 1775, and May 1812.\n\nThe principal endemic diseases are intermittent and remittent fevers,\nelephantiasis and bronchocele, dysentery and diarrhoea, rheumatism, ophthalmia, and intestinal worms. Cholera and small-pox both occasionally visit the District in an epidemic form. No attention whatever is paid to sanitation in the rural tracts; but the munificence of the late Naw\u00e1b Abdul Gan\u00ed some years ago presented Dacca city with a fund for undertaking sanitary improvements, and also with a pure water supply. The institutions for medical relief comprise the lunatic asylum, the Mitford Hospital, an almshouse founded in 1866 by Naw\u00e1b Abdul Gan\u00ed, and 9 charitable dispensaries. In 1881, the dispensaries and the hospital were attended by 3530 in-door and 66,304 out-door patients.

Area, 1266 square miles; towns and villages, 2082; occupied houses, 108,512. Population (1881), males 343,228, and females 355,801; total, 699,029. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Muhammadans, 378,834; Hindus, 314,613; Christians, 5524; Buddhists, 11; Br\u00e1hmos, 43; 'others,' 4. Average number of persons per square mile (exclusive of Dacca city), 552; villages per square mile, 164; persons per village, 305; houses per square mile, 90; inmates per house, 6\u00b74. Dacca Sub-division comprises the 4 police circles of L\u00e1l B\u00e1gh, S\u00e1bh\u00e1r, K\u00e1p\u00e1s\u00ed\u00e1, and Naw\u00e1bganj. In 1883, it contained 8 civil courts, besides an honorary Magistrate's court, and a municipal bench in Dacca city; and 8 criminal courts. The police force consisted of 479 regular police of all ranks, and 1001 village watchmen.\n\nDacca.\u2014The city of Dacca, the chief town of the District and Commissionership of the same name, and the fifth largest city under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, is situated on the north bank of the Bur\u00edgang\u00e1 river (formerly, no doubt, as its name implies, the main stream of the Ganges), in 23\u00b0 43' N. lat., and 90\u00b0 26' 25\" E. long., 8 miles above the confluence of the Bur\u00edgang\u00e1 with the Dhaleswari. The municipal limits include an area of about 8 square miles, and the population, according to the Census of 1881, numbers 79,076 persons. In 1881-82, the municipal income was \u00a311,342; rate of taxation, 2s. 5d. per head.\n\nThe town extends along the bank of the river for a distance of nearly 4 miles, and inland, towards the north, for about one mile and a quarter.\nIt is intersected by a branch of the Dol\u00e1i creek. The two principal streets cross each other at right angles. One runs parallel to the river for upwards of two miles, from the L\u00e1l B\u00e1gh Palace to the Dol\u00e1i creek. The other leads north from the river to the old military cantonments; it is about one mile and a quarter in length, of considerable width, and bordered by regularly built houses. The chauk or market-place, a square of fine dimensions, lies at the extreme west. The remainder of the town is composed of narrow, crooked lanes, few of which admit wheeled conveyances. The native houses vary in height from one to four storeys. In some of the crowded quarters, such as those occupied by the weavers and shell-carvers, each house has a frontage of only 8 or 10 feet; but the side-walls run back for a distance of 60 feet. The two ends only of such houses are roofed in, the middle forming an open court. The houses of the European residents extend along the river for a space of about half a mile, in the centre of the town. In the Armenian and Greek quarters, there are several large brick houses, now falling into decay. Dacca preserves few traces of its former magnificence as the Muhammadan capital of Bengal during the 17th century. The old fort, erected in the reign of the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, has entirely disappeared. The only public buildings of this period still remaining are the Katr\u00e1, built by Sult\u00e1n Mu\u1e25ammad Shuj\u00e1 in 1645; and the palace of the L\u00e1l B\u00e1gh, which several successive Naw\u00e1bs intended to associate with their name, but which was never completed. Both these buildings are now mere ruins, and their decorations have been wantonly destroyed. The factories built by the English, the French, and the Dutch during the 17th century have also been swept away. An outline of the history of the city has been given in the preceding article on DACCA DISTRICT. The city was first selected as the seat of the Muhammadan Government of Bengal about 1610, owing to its convenient position for controlling the waterways of the delta, which were then ravaged by Portuguese pirates in alliance with the Arakanese. In 1704, the Naw\u00e1b Mursh\u00edd Kuli Kh\u00e1n moved his residence to Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d; and though Dacca long retained a titular Naw\u00e1b, its glory departed with the removal of the court. When in the height of its prosperity, Dacca must have been very populous. Its suburbs are said to have extended 15 miles northwards, as far as the village of Tung\u00ed, where mosques and brick houses are still to be discovered buried beneath thick jungle. During the 18th century, Dacca won a new reputation for its manufacture of fine muslins, which became famous in the markets of the West. The cotton grown in the neighbourhood is said to be of peculiarly fine quality. The weavers, who were mostly Hindus, attained a wonderful delicacy of taste and dexterity of manipulation, by means of hereditary devotion to their industry. At the close of the last century, the annual investment made\nby the East India Company and by private traders for Dacca muslins was estimated at \u00a3250,000. But in the beginning of the present century, this industry began rapidly to decline, under the competition of cheaper piece-goods from Manchester. By 1813, the value of the private trade had fallen to \u00a320,000, and four years later, the Commercial Residency of the Company was closed. The prosperity of the city has never recovered from this second blow. The reduced and impoverished population, the ruinous and abandoned houses, still show the disastrous results of the loss Dacca has sustained in her cotton manufactures. In 1800, the number of inhabitants was estimated, and apparently not over-estimated, at 200,000; in 1872, a Census of the town showed that the total had fallen to 69,212. A small colony of weavers of muslin still exists, who produce fabrics of exceptional excellence, working under a system of advances from native capitalists. In recent years, the general development of trade throughout Bengal has brought back to Dacca a little of its former wealth, and the city is now increasing in population. The city is favourably situated to command the three river systems of the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, and the Meghn\u00e1. If we include the commerce of N\u00e1r\u00e1\u00ednganj and Madanganj, which may be regarded as the river ports of Dacca, its total trade exceeds that of any inland mart of Bengal except Patn\u00e1. The collection of jute, oil-seeds, rice, and hides, and the distribution of piece-goods and salt, constitute the most important functions of the Dacca merchants; and Dacca boatmen are well known throughout Bengal as the most adventurous of their class. In the year 1876\u201377, the total trade of Dacca city, excluding N\u00e1r\u00e1\u00ednganj and Madanganj, was valued at \u00a31,183,000. The chief articles of export were\u2014hides, \u00a3130,000; jute, \u00a379,000; food grains, \u00a341,000; the imports included\u2014piece-goods, \u00a3436,000; cotton twist, \u00a379,000; timber, \u00a335,000; and salt, \u00a325,000. As explained on p. 87, in the article on Dacca city, no later trade statistics are available under the new system of registration.\n\nThe population of the city is thus classified in the Census Report of 1881:\u2014Hindus, males 22,774, females 16,861\u2014total, 39,635; Muhammadans, males 18,634, females 20,279\u2014total, 38,913; Christians and others, males 295, females 233\u2014total, 528. Grand total, males 41,703, females 37,373\u2014total, 79,076. The large proportion of females among the Muhammadan population is worthy of notice. The total of Christians includes a few Armenians and Greeks, who formerly conducted a considerable share of the trade of the city. Foremost among the citizens of Dacca may be mentioned the late Naw\u00e1b Abdul Gani, C.S.I., who in 1866 founded the Langar Kh\u00e1na, or almshouse, for the accommodation of poor persons permanently disabled from work. He subsequently made a donation of \u00a35000 to the municipality for the carrying out of sanitary improvements; and in 1878, a system of\nwater-works was opened, which he had constructed for the city at his own expense.\n\nDacca is well provided with educational institutions. The Dacca College, with a staff of European professors, is one of the best of its class in India. In connection with the college there is an English school department, and English is also taught at the five following institutions:\u2014The Pogose School, established by a wealthy Armenian gentleman; Naw\u00e1b Abdul Gan\u00ed's school; the Jagann\u00e1th school, founded by a Hindu zamind\u00e1r in memory of his father; the Rupl\u00e1l Ragh\u00fan\u00e1th school, established by the liberality of two wealthy native gentlemen of the above names; and the Muhammadan Madr\u00e1sa.\n\nUntil the conservancy reforms effected by the aid of the liberality of Naw\u00e1b Abdul Gan\u00ed, the sanitary condition of Dacca city was very unsatisfactory. During the rainy season, the whole city is surrounded by a labyrinth of brimming creeks, and the low-lying suburbs are liable to be flooded every year. In former times, the simplest rules of conservancy were disregarded, and much difficulty has been experienced in overcoming the traditional prejudices of all classes of the community. It is hoped, however, that the health of the city will now be sensibly improved by recent reforms, and by the introduction of a pure water supply. The principal charitable institution is the Mitford Hospital, established in 1858, by a bequest of a member of the Civil Service. The wards are well planned and lofty, and the building stands in grounds of its own, by the river-side. In 1881, the total number of in-door patients was 1634, and of out-door patients 19,138. A permanent endowment of \u00a316,000 was left by the founder.\n\nD\u00e1dar.\u2014Town in Kachhi Province, Baluchist\u00e1n; situated in lat. 29\u00b0 28' N., and long. 67\u00b0 34' E., on the Bolan river, about 5 miles east of the Bolan Pass, and 37 north-west from B\u00e1g; elevation above sea level, about 700 feet; population not exceeding 2000. Surrounded by bare and rocky hills, which render the heat in summer perhaps greater than that of any other place in the world in the same parallel of latitude. D\u00e1dar is supplied with excellent water from the river Bolan during a great part of the year. Wheat, cotton, cucumbers, and melons are grown in the neighbourhood of the town.\n\nDadh\u00e1lya.\u2014Estate in M\u00e1hi K\u00e1ntha, Bombay Presidency. The area of the land under cultivation in 1881 was estimated at 5000 acres, the population at 3877, and the revenue at about \u00a3330. The Th\u00e1kur is a tributary chief, paying annually \u00a370 as gh\u00e1s-d\u00e1na, or forage for cattle, to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and \u00a361 as kichri, or supplies for troops, to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Edar. He has enjoyed semi-independent power since the establishment of his family in M\u00e1hi K\u00e1ntha. The family are Sesodia R\u00e1jputs, who originally came from Udaipur.\n(Oodeypore) in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. They hold no sanad authorising adoption; the rule of primogeniture is followed in regard to succession. The first Th\u00e1kur entered the service of the chief of Edar with a body of horse, and obtained the gift of 48 villages, in 1674. At a later date, the Dadh\u00e1lya chief, refusing to serve under the M\u00e1rw\u00e1r princes who assumed the Government of Edar, had his grant reduced to its present limits.\n\nD\u00e1dri.\u2014Village in Bulandshahr District, North-Western Provinces, lying on the Grand Trunk Road, 20 miles north-east of Bulandshahr, and 23 miles south-east of Delhi. Population (1881) 2421; police station, travellers\u2019 bungalow, post-office, village school, encamping ground for troops, weekly market. The railway station (East Indian Railway) is a mile and a half s.w. of the village, and connected with it by a broad metalled road. Ruins of a fort built at the end of the 18th century by Darg\u00e1hi Singh, whose descendants held estates in the neighbourhood till 1857, when they joined the rebels. The police station is all that now remains of the fort. Two members of the family were hanged, and their possessions were confiscated. Colonel Greathed\u2019s column occupied D\u00e1dri on the 26th of September 1857, and, finding much property taken from Europeans, burned the neighbouring villages.\n\nD\u00e1d\u00fa.\u2014T\u00e1luk in the Sehw\u00e1n Sub-division, Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed (Kurrachee) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 26\u00b0 29' 30\" to 26\u00b0 56' 39\" N.; long. 67\u00b0 22' 30\" to 67\u00b0 57' 45\" E.; area, 762 square miles; population (1881) 66,811, namely, 5101 Hindus, 59,181 Muhammadans, 2522 Sikhs, and 7 Christians, dwelling in 2 towns and 77 villages, and occupying 12,132 houses. The Sub-division contains 3 criminal courts, with 11 police stations, and a police force of 71 men.\n\nD\u00e1d\u00fa.\u2014Chief town in D\u00e1d\u00fa t\u00e1luk, Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 26\u00b0 43' 30\" N.; long. 67\u00b0 49' E. Population (1881) 2270, principally agriculturists. Municipal income (1880\u201381) \u00a3232; incidence of taxation per head of population, 2s. A subordinate civil court, post-office, staging bungalow, and railway station.\n\nDafl\u00e1pur (or Jath).\u2014J\u00e1gir within the Political Agency of Sat\u00e1ra, in Bombay Presidency, and really an integral part of the State of Jath, to which it will lapse on the demise of the three widows of the late chief. The founder of the Jath j\u00e1gir was hereditary p\u00e1tel of Daflapur village, and took his surname of Dafle therefrom. Lat. 17\u00b0 0' N.; long. 75\u00b0 7' E. In 1820, the British Government made an engagement with the ancestors of the present chief of Jath, confirming them in the estates they then held. In 1827, the Jath estate was attached by the R\u00e1ja of Sat\u00e1ra to pay off the chief\u2019s debts, but, after their liquidation, it was restored in 1841. The British Government have more than once interfered to adjust the pecuniary affairs of the Jath j\u00e1gir; and, in\nconsequence of numerous oppressions, were compelled in 1874 to assume the direct management on behalf of the holder. The estate of Daflapur consists of 6 detached villages in the Jath j\u00e1gir; area, about 94 square miles; population (1881) 6006; gross revenue, \u00a3901. The land is generally poor, but fairly good in the eastern villages. Products, the staple millets (b\u00e1jra and jo\u00e1r), cotton, wheat, gram, safflower, and t\u00fcr. There are 3 schools in the estate with 56 pupils. The present ruler is the senior widow, Lakshmib\u00e1i Dafle, Deshmukh, a Kshatriya (Mar\u00e1th\u00e1) by caste.\u2014See JATH.\n\nDaflapur.\u2014Chief town of the Daflapur estate, in Sat\u00e1ra District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 17\u00b0 0' N., long. 75\u00b0 7' E.; about 80 miles south-east of Sat\u00e1ra, and 85 miles north-east of Belgaum.\n\nDaga.\u2014A creek in Irawadi Division, British Burma, which leaves the Bassein River 3 or 4 miles from its northern mouth, in Henzada District, in lat. 17\u00b0 42' 0\" N., and long. 95\u00b0 25' 0\" E., and after a tortuous south-west course, rejoins it near Bassein town, lat. 16\u00b0 55' 0\" N., and long. 94\u00b0 48' 0\" E. The northern entrance has silted up, and is now completely closed by the embankment of the Bassein; the bed for about 8 miles down, as far as Ywathit, is dry during the hot season. In the rains the downward current is strong, but in the dry season the tide is felt as far as Thabye-hla at neaps, and fifteen miles farther at springs. The Daga is navigable by river steamers during the rains for 36 miles, from its southern outlet to the Min-mnaing creek; it is practicable all the year round for native craft as far as Ky\u00fan-pyaw, where the creek is from 200 to 300 feet wide, and 10 to 15 feet deep. A few miles below Ky\u00fan-pyaw is the Inyeh-gyi Lake, communicating with the Daga by a small channel.\n\nDagsh\u00e1i.\u2014Hill cantonment in Simla District, Punjab; situated on a bare and treeless height 42 miles south of Simla, on the cart-road to Kalka, in lat. 30\u00b0 53' 5\" N.; long. 77\u00b0 5' 38\" E. Established in 1842; now regularly occupied by a European regiment. Population (1881) 3642; Hindus, 2129; Sikhs, 2; Muhammadans, 624; 'others,' nearly all European troops, 887; number of occupied houses, 612. The station, though usually healthy, suffered from an epidemic of cholera in 1872.\n\nDa-gyaing.\u2014River in Amherst District, Tenasserim, British Burma. Rises in the Dawna spur, and, flowing westward, joins the Hlaingbweh about half-way between the villages of Kazaing and Hlaingbweh. In the rains it brings down a considerable body of water, but a swift current and numerous rocks render it unnavigable.\n\nD\u00e1h\u00e1nu.\u2014Sub-division of Th\u00e1na District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 634 square miles; number of villages, 209. Population (1881) 109,322, namely, 54,575 males and 54,747 females. Hindus number 97,676; Muhammadans, 1678; 'others,' 9968. Land revenue (1882-83)\n\u00a312,675. This Sub-division lies in the extreme north of the District; it has a picturesque aspect, most of the interior being occupied by forest-clad hills in small detached ranges of varying height. Towards the coast are broad flats, hardly above sea level, and seamed by tidal creeks. The climate of the interior is unhealthy, and though that of the coast is generally pleasant and equable, after the rains it becomes feverish. The Sub-division contains 1 civil and 4 criminal courts, with 2 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), and a police force of 87 men.\n\nD\u00e1h\u00e1nu.\u2014Seaport town in the D\u00e1h\u00e1nu Sub-division of Th\u00e1na District, Bombay Presidency.

First rose to importance under the rule of the N\u00e1hirs (vide Dera Ghazi Khan District), from whom it was wrested by Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n; subsequently fell into the hands of the Kh\u00e1ns of Khel\u00e1t. Formerly a thriving town, trading with the country beyond the British frontier, but now in a decayed state, the traffic having taken different channels. Forms with the adjoining village of Naushahra a third-class municipality; revenue (1875-76) \u00a3284, or 10\u00bdd. per head of population (6335) within municipal limits.\n\nD\u00e1k\u00e1tia.\u2014River of Bengal; rises in Hill Tipperah, and flows through the southern portion of Tipperah District, where it is joined by numerous hill streams. After taking a westerly course past L\u00e1ksh\u00e1m, Chitos\u00ed, and Hajiganj, the D\u00e1k\u00e1tia sweeps suddenly round to the south-\nward 6\u00bd miles east of Ch\u00e1ndpur, and empties itself into the Meghn\u00e1 a little above the village of R\u00e1ipur, in No\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed District. A direct canal has recently been cut from Shikarh\u00e1t, about 20 miles east of Ch\u00e1ndpur, to R\u00e1ipur, thus cutting off a bend of about 40 miles.\n\n**Dakhineswar.**\u2014Village on the H\u00fagl\u00ed, in the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal; situated a little north of Calcutta. Contains a powder magazine, and a few country houses of Europeans. Also noted for its twelve beautiful temples in honour of Siva, built on the river bank. Aided vernacular school here.\n\n**Dakor.**\u2014Town in the Th\u00e1sr\u00e1 Sub-division of K\u00e1ira District, Bombay Presidency, and a station on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, Anand-Godhra branch; 16 miles north-east of the Anand railway station.

It was created a separate administrative Sub-division in 1845, and comprises the two th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles of Bhola and Barhan-ud-d\u00edn Hald\u00e1r. Area, 615 square miles; 408 villages or towns, 21,209 occupied houses, and a population (1881) of 212,230, namely, males 113,880, and females 98,350; proportion of males in total population, 53\u00b72 per cent. Muhammadans numbered 179,526; Hindus, 32,682; Christians, 7; and Buddhists, 15. Average density of population, 345 per square mile; villages per square mile, \u201866; houses per square mile, 37\u00b77; persons per village, 520; persons per house, 10. The cyclone of 31st October 1876 is said to have swept away almost the entire population of Daulat Kh\u00e1n, then the headquarters town of the Sub-division. The island is a typical deltaic tract, formed out of the silt brought down by the Ganges and Brahmaputra. Its level is said to be higher than that of the adjacent delta or the B\u00e1karganj mainland. The strong \u2018bore\u2019 of the Meghn\u00e1 at spring tides rushes upon the east of Daksh\u00edn Sh\u00e1hb\u00e1zpur, flooding all the watercourses and creeks. The north and eastern sides are being cut away by the river, many homesteads with their palm groves annually disappearing in the river; while large alluvial accretions are constantly\nforming farther down the estuary, at the southern point of Dakshin Shahb\u00e1zpur.\n\n**Dala.**\u2014A suburb of Rangoon city, Pegu Division, British Burma; situated on the right or western bank of the Rangoon river. Formerly the Dala circle included Angyi, now a part of Hanthawad\u00ed District, and Pyap\u00fan, a portion of Thungwa; but these were transferred at the end of the last century. The town was founded in the 11th century, and was then called Dhalan\u00e1gara. Population (1881) 6953.\n\n**Dala.**\u2014A creek in Hanthawadi District, Pegu Division, British Burma, which empties itself into the Rangoon river opposite Rangoon city. On the west side of its mouth are dockyards, and to the east, timber yards and steam sawmills. In the dry season it is navigable for a few miles only, but during the rains boats can traverse its entire length.\n\n**Dala-nwun.**\u2014River in Shwe-gyin District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. Rises in the eastern spurs of the Pegu Yomas, and, flowing south-east, falls into the Sittaung a few miles below Thayet-thamein. Navigable by large boats as far as Thungwa.\n\n**Dalat (Dhalet).**\u2014River in Kyaukh-py\u00fa District, Arakan Division, British Burma, rising in the main range, and falling into the sea at Combermere Bay. It is navigable as far as Dalet (sometimes called Talak) village, 25 miles from its mouth. In its upper reaches the stream is a mountain torrent, only passable by small canoes.\n\n**Dalgom\u00e1.**\u2014Village in Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra District, Assam, at which a large fair is held annually in January, on the anniversary of the death of a former high priest of the temple. Lat. 26\u00b0 6' N., long. 90\u00b0 49' E. A revenue court (zamind\u00e1ri kach\u00e1ri) of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bijni, the principal landowner of the District, is situated in this village.\n\n**Dalhousie.**\u2014Municipal town, cantonment, and hill sanitarium, attached to Path\u00e1nkot tahsil, Gurd\u00e1spur District, Punjab, but lying outside the limits of the main District. Lat. 32\u00b0 31' 45\" N., long. 76\u00b0 0' 15\" E. The Station occupies the summits and upper slopes of three mountain peaks in the main Him\u00e1layan range east of the R\u00e1vi river; distant from Path\u00e1nkot 51 miles north-west, from Gurd\u00e1sipur 74 miles; elevation above the sea, 7687 feet. To the east the granite peak of D\u00e1in K\u00fand, clothed with dark pine forests, and capped with snow even during part of summer, towers to a height of 9000 feet; while beyond, again, the peaks of the Dh\u00e1ola Dhar, covered with perpetual winter, shut in the K\u00e1ngra valley and close the view in that direction. The scenery may compare favourably with that of any mountain station in the Him\u00e1layan range. The hills consist of rugged granite, and the houses are perched on a few gentler slopes among the declivities; most of the houses are double-storied. The first project for the formation of a sanitarium at this spot originated with Colonel Napier, now Lord\nNapier of Magdala, in 1851. In the following year the British Government purchased the site from the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Chamba, and the new station was marked off in 1854. No systematic occupation, however, took place until 1860. In that year, Dalhousie was attached to the District of Gurd\u00e1spur; the road from the plains was widened, and building operations commenced on a large scale. Troops were stationed in the Bal\u00fan barracks in 1868, and the sanitarium rapidly acquired reputation as a fashionable resort. A military camel road now leads direct to the cantonment from below Dimiria; and there is a good water-supply for the troops. The town now contains a court-house, branch treasury, police-station, post-office, dispensary, church, and several hotels. A European firm have built a brewery. The sanitary arrangements are still somewhat imperfect. Municipal revenue (1882-83), \u00a3829; expenditure, \u00a3641. The population fluctuates greatly, according to the season of the year. At the time the Census was taken (February 1881), the population, including Bal\u00fan cantonments, was returned at 1610, namely, of 1009 Hindus, 397 Muhammadans, 8 Sikhs, and 196 \u2018others;\u2019 and this may be considered as the permanent resident population, the visitors from the plains not arriving till later in the year.\n\n**D\u00e1l\u00edngkot** (or Kal\u00edmpong).\u2014A hilly tract situated east of the T\u00edst\u00e1, west of the Ne-chu and De-chu rivers, and south of Independent Sikkim. It was acquired as the result of the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n campaign of 1864, and now forms a part of Darj\u00edling District, Bengal. The principal village in it is K\u00e1l\u00edmpong, situated at an elevation of 3916 feet, and the tract has now taken the name of K\u00e1l\u00edmpong. The Sub-division has recently been divided into three main tracts\u2014(1) A tract set apart for native cultivators, of which 30,000 acres of cultivated land have been surveyed and settled with the occupiers on ten-year leases. (2) A forest and cinchona reserve, covering 140,433 acres. (3) Tea cultivation, 9000 acres. In the lower ranges, a small area has been reserved as a sanitarium for the tea-planters of the Dw\u00e1rs. K\u00e1l\u00edmpong village is on the trade route across the Jelep pass into Tibet. It has a h\u00e1z\u00e1r of about a dozen shops, mostly branch shops of D\u00e1rjiling traders, and sub-divisional offices. The construction of a bridge across the T\u00edst\u00e1 has rendered the tract accessible from the west at all seasons of the year, and the population is rapidly increasing. In 1872, the tract contained only 3526 inhabitants; by 1881, the population had risen to 12,683, namely, Hindus, 6475; Buddhists, 6153; Muhammadans, 9; Christians, 44; and \u2018others,\u2019 2. Area, 486 square miles; number of villages, 32; and occupied houses, 2565.\n\n**Dalli.**\u2014Zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1ri or estate in Bhand\u00e1ra District, Central Provinces Population (1881) 3431, namely, males 1766, and females 1665, chiefly Gonds, residing in 17 small villages and 688 houses; area,\n52 square miles, of which only 5 are rudely cultivated. The Great Eastern Road runs across Dalli, through the Mundip\u00e1r Pass, the hills round which furnish an abundant supply of bamboos. The chief is a Gond. Principal village, Dalli, situated in lat. $21^\\circ 5' 30''$ N., long. $80^\\circ 16'$ E.\n\n**Dalm\u00e1.**\u2014The principal hill in the mountain range of the same name in M\u00e1nbh\u00fam District, Bengal; height, 3407 feet. It has been described as the 'rival of P\u00e1rasn\u00e1th;' but it lacks the bold precipices and commanding peaks of that hill, and is merely a long rolling ridge rising gradually to its highest point. Its slopes are covered with dense forest, but are accessible to men and beasts of burden. The chief aboriginal tribes living on Dalm\u00e1 Hill are the Khar\u00ed\u00e1s and Pah\u00e1ri\u00e1s.\n\n**D\u00e1lmau.**\u2014Tahsil of R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli District, Oudh, consisting of the pargan\u00e1s of D\u00e1lmau, Sareni, and Khiron. Area (1881) 479 square miles. Population (1881) 262,499, namely, males 128,471, and females 134,028. Hindus numbered 250,864; Muhammadans, 11,588; and 'others,' 47. Total Government land revenue, \u00a339,373, being at the rate of 2s. 4\u00bdd. per acre. Of the 584 villages in the tahsil, 440 are held under tal\u00fakd\u00e1ri tenure, 63 are zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri, 56 patt\u00edd\u00e1ri, and 26 rent free.\n\n**D\u00e1lmau.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of D\u00e1lmau tahsil, R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli District, Oudh. Bounded on the north by R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli pargan\u00e1; on the east by Salon; on the south by Fatehpur District, the Ganges marking the border line; and on the west by Kh\u00edron and Sareni pargan\u00e1s. Originally held by the Bhars till their extirpation by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sharki of Jaunpur, but first created a pargan\u00e1 by Akbar. The Bais were almost the sole proprietors till the forfeiture of the great estate of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Beni Madhu, and its distribution among other proprietors. A fertile tract, with an area of 253 square miles, of which 121 are cultivated. Population (1881) 139,184, namely, 68,320 males and 70,864 females; average density, 573 persons per square mile. Ten market villages, of which Lalganj is the most important. Main imports\u2014rice and sugar from Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d), and cotton from Fatehpur; extensive trade in cattle. Saltpetre was formerly manufactured in considerable quantities, but the industry now exists on a small scale in only two villages. Two large annual fairs, each attended by about 50,000 persons, are held in the parzan\u00e1.\n\n**D\u00e1lmau.**\u2014Town and head-quarters of D\u00e1lmau tahsil in R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli District, Oudh; on the right bank of the Ganges, 16 miles south of R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli town, and 14 miles north of Fatehpur. Lat. $26^\\circ 3' 45''$ N., long. $81^\\circ 4' 20''$ E. The town is said to have been founded about 1500 years ago by a brother of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kanauj. It was for long in the possession of the Bhars, and the surrounding country was the scene of a protracted struggle maintained by that tribe against the encroachments\nof the Muhammadans. About 1400 A.D., the Bhars were almost annihilated by Sult\u00e1n Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sharki. Several Muhammadan mosques and tombs, in various stages of decay, and the ruins of the ancient Bhar fortress, attest the bygone importance of the town. During the last century it has steadily declined. Its population in 1881 consisted of 4443 Hindus and 924 Muhammadans; total, 5367, namely, males 2725, and females 2642; area of town site, 1029 acres. The principal buildings are several mosques, a magnificent Hindu temple dedicated to Mah\u00e1deo, and a s\u00e1r\u00e1i or rest-house. A metalled road from the Ganges to Lucknow, via R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli, passes through the centre of the town, which is the seat of a tahsild\u00e1r exercising the powers of a magistrate, and also of an inspector of police. The munsif\u2019s court exercises jurisdiction over the whole of the D\u00e1lmau tahsil, and the pargan\u00e1 of Salon. Three bi-weekly markets, police station, post-office, Government Anglovernacular school, and branch dispensary. Large annual fair, attended by from 50,000 to 60,000 persons, is held on the last day of K\u00e1rtik, at which a considerable trade is carried on.\n\nD\u00e1lmi.\u2014Site of remarkable Hindu ruins on the Subarn\u00e1rekha river, M\u00e1nbh\u00fam District, Bengal. Lat. 23\u00b0 4' N., long. 86\u00b0 4' E. They comprise an old fort, with the remains of curious temples, dedicated both to the S\u00edvaite and Vishnuvite objects of worship. There are some indications that the Br\u00e1hmans who built and used these temples were preceded by Buddhists.\n\nDaltonanj.\u2014Administrative head-quarters of Pal\u00e1mau Sub-division, Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 District, Bengal. Prettily situated on the North Koel river, opposite the old town of Sh\u00e1hpur. Lat. 24\u00b0 2' 15\" N., long. 84\u00b0 6' 40\" E. A brisk local trade is springing up. The town contains a court-house, and the usual sub-divisional offices, a munsif, and the head-quarters of a divisional forest officer. Population (1881) 7440, namely, Hindus, 6025; Muhammadans, 1286; and \u2018others,\u2019 129. Area of town site, 3374 acres. Municipal income (1881\u201382), \u00a3218; expenditure, \u00a3219. The town is named after Colonel Dalton, late Commissioner of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur.\n\nDaltonanj Coal-field.\u2014The name given to an area of 200 square miles in the valleys of the Koel and Am\u00e1nat rivers. The civil station of Daltonanj lies just beyond its southern border. Of the whole field, only about 30 square miles are considered by the geological surveyors to be important as coal-bearing tracts. The coal-bearing area has not been ascertained with any certainty, but mining engineers who have recently inspected the tract are of opinion that it contains a great deal more coal than set down in the estimate of the Geological Survey.\n\nDamalcherri.\u2014Pass in North Arcot District, Madras Presidency by which the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chief Sivaj\u00ed made his first descent (1676) upon the\nKarnatic; and here, in 1749, Dost Ali the Naw\u00e1b was killed in battle with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Latitude $13^\\circ 25' 40''$ N., longitude $79^\\circ 5' E$. During the campaigns of 1780\u201382, it formed the main route for the supplies of Haidar Al\u00ed\u2019s troops when invading the Karnatic.\n\n**Dam\u00e1n (the \u2018skirt\u2019 of the hills).**\u2014A tract of upland in the Punjab, lying between $28^\\circ 40'$ and $33^\\circ 20'$ N. lat., and between $69^\\circ 30'$ and $71^\\circ 20'$ E. long., comprising the country lying at the eastern foot of the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n mountains, and the high right bank of the Indus in Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n District. Naturally bare and devoid of vegetation, it derives fertility in places from the waters of hill torrents, particularly the Gumal, T\u00e1nk Zan\u00ed, Sohel, and Wahoa.\n\n**Dam\u00e1n.**\u2014A Portuguese town and Settlement in the Province of Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t (Guz\u00e9r\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency; situated about 100 miles north of Bombay. Including the *pargan\u00e1* of Nagar Havili, it contains an area of 82 square miles, with a total population (1881), including absentees and temporary residents, of 49,084 persons. The Settlement of Dam\u00e1n is bounded north by the river Bhagw\u00e1n, east by British territory, south by the Kalem river, and west by the Gulf of Cambay. Dam\u00e1n town is situated in latitude $22^\\circ 25'$ N., longitude $72^\\circ 53'$ E.\n\nThe Settlement is composed of two portions, in Dam\u00e1n proper, namely, *pargan\u00e1* Naer or *Dam\u00e1n Grande*, and *pargan\u00e1* Calana Pavori or *Dam\u00e1n Pequeno*, and the detached *pargan\u00e1* of Nagar Havili, separated from it by a narrow strip of British territory, 5 to 7 miles in width, and intersected by the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway. The town of Dam\u00e1n was sacked by the Portuguese in 1531, rebuilt by the natives, and retaken in 1558 by the Portuguese, who made it one of their permanent establishments in India. They converted the mosque into a church, and have since built eight other places of worship. The portion of Dam\u00e1n proper contains an area of 22 square miles, and 29 villages, with a population of 21,622 souls; it lies at the entrance of the Gulf of Cambay, and is divided by the river Dam\u00e1n-Gang\u00e1 into the two separate tracts known as *Dam\u00e1n Grande* (Great Dam\u00e1n) and *Dam\u00e1n Piqueno* (Little Dam\u00e1n). The first, on the south, is contiguous to the British District of Th\u00e1na, while the other lies towards the north and borders on Surat District. This portion of the Settlement was conquered from Bofata on the 2nd of February 1559, by the Portuguese under Dom Constantino de Braganza. The *pargan\u00e1* of Nagar Havili, situated towards the east, has an area of 60 square miles, with a population (1881) of 27,462 persons, and is likewise sub-divided into two parts, called Eteli Pati and Upeli Pati, containing respectively 22 and 50 villages. It was ceded to the Portuguese by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, in indemnification for piratical acts committed against a ship carrying a flag of the former nation, in accordance with the treaty signed at Poona on 6th of January 1780.\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The principal rivers are\u2014(1) the Bhagw\u00e1n, forming the northern boundary of the Settlement; (2) the Kalem, running along the southern boundary; and (3) the Sandalkh\u00e1l or Dam\u00e1n-Gang\u00e1 (Border Ganges), a deep navigable stream, rising in the Gh\u00e1ts about 40 miles east of Dam\u00e1n proper. All these fall into the Gulf of Cambay. The Dam\u00e1n-Gang\u00e1 has a bar at its mouth\u2014dry at the lowest ebb tides, but with 18 to 20 feet of water at high tides. Outside this bar is a roadstead, where vessels of 300 to 400 tons may ride at anchor, and discharge cargo. Dam\u00e1n has long enjoyed a high celebrity for its docks and shipbuilding yards, due chiefly to the excellent teak with which the country is stocked. The climate of the place is generally healthy throughout the year. The Settlement has no minerals, but possesses stately forests in the pargan\u00e1 of Nagar Havili, whose total value is estimated at about \u00a3444,000. About two-thirds of these forests consist of teak (Tectona grandis); the other timber-trees include\u2014sadura (Pentaptera arjuna), khayer (Acacia catechu), sissu (Dalbergia sissoo), l\u00e1l kh\u00e1yer (Acacia sundra), tanas (Dalbergia ujjainensis), siwana (Gmelina arborea), dambora (Conocarpus latifolius), hedu (Nuclea cordifolia), asan (Briedelia spinosa), timburni (Diospyros montana), and b\u00e1b\u00fal (Acacia arabica). The forests are not conserved, and the extent of land covered by each kind of timber has not yet been precisely determined.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The soil is moist and fertile, especially in the pargan\u00e1 of Nagar Havili. Principal crops\u2014rice, wheat, the inferior cereals common to Gujar\u00e1t, and tobacco. Despite the facility of cultivation, only one-twentieth part of the territory is under tillage. In the pargan\u00e1 of Nagar Havili, the greater part of the soil is the property of Government, from whom the cultivators hold their tenures direct. A tax is levied on all lands, whether alienated or the property of the State. There is, however, no fixed rate of assessment, as the tax is regulated by a general estimate of the productiveness of each village. The total revenue thus obtained amounts to about \u00a3800.\n\nTrade, etc.\u2014Before the decline of the Portuguese power in the East, Dam\u00e1n carried on an extensive commerce, especially with the eastern coast of Africa, to which the cotton fabrics made in Gujar\u00e1t were largely exported in vessels carrying the Portuguese flag. From 1817 to 1837, there was a flourishing trade with China in opium imported from Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed (Kurrachee). But since the conquest of Sind by the British, the transport of opium has been prohibited, and thus Dam\u00e1n has been deprived of its chief source of wealth. In old days, Dam\u00e1n was noted for its weaving and dyeing. The former industry is still carried on to a limited extent, chiefly by the wives of Musalm\u00e1n khal\u00e1sis or sailors, while the latter is almost extinct. The piece-goods, made from a mixture of English and country twist, are of a quality and pattern worn only by\nthe natives of Goa, Mozambique, and Diu, to which places they are exported. Mats and baskets of khaj\u00fari and bamboo are manufactured on a large scale. A noteworthy feature in connection with the industrial occupations of the place is its deep-sea fishing, giving employment to 150 vessels, each with a crew of about 30 khandis. They make for the coast of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, near Diu, where they remain for some months, and return laden with salted fish cured on board.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The total population of the Settlement in 1881, including absentees and temporary residents, was 48,084, of whom 27,462 (almost entirely Hindus) inhabit the pargan\u00e1 of Nagar Havili. According to the Census of 1850, the population of Dam\u00e1n proper was returned at 33,559\u2014it is now said to be reduced to 21,622. In the total population the number of Christians is returned at 1615, of whom 15 are Europeans. The total number of houses amounts to 10,202; but only a very few are of any size or pretensions. The native Christians adopt the European costume. Some of the women dress themselves after the present European fashion, while others follow the old style once prevalent in Portugal and Spain, viz. a petticoat and mantle.\n\n**Administration.**\u2014The territory of Dam\u00e1n forms, for administrative purposes, a single District, and has a municipal chamber or corporation. It is ruled by a Governor invested with both civil and military functions, subordinate to the Governor-General of Goa. The judicial department is superintended by a judge, with an establishment composed of a delegate of the attorney-general, and two or three clerks. The total revenues of Dam\u00e1n in 1873\u201374 amounted to \u00a37960, 10s., of which the larger portion was derived from the pargan\u00e1 of Nagar Havili. The chief sources of revenue are land-tax, forests, abk\u00e1ri or excise, and customs duties. The expenditure in the same year was \u00a37880, 4s. The police force consisted, in 1874, of 194 officers and men.\n\nThe Settlement of Dam\u00e1n has two forts, situated on either side of the river Dam\u00e1n-Gang\u00e1. The former is almost a square in shape, and built of stone. It contains, besides the ruins of the old monastic establishments, the Governor's palace, together with the buildings appertaining to it, military barracks, hospital, municipal office, courthouse, jail, two modern churches, and numerous private residences. On the land side this fort is protected by a ditch crossed by a drawbridge, while at its north-west angle extends the principal bastion, which commands the entrance to the harbour. It is occupied by the Governor and his staff, the military establishments, officers connected with the Government, and a few private individuals; all are Christians. The smaller fort, which is a more recent structure, is placed by the Portuguese under the patronage of St. Jerome. Its form is that of an irregular quadrilateral, enclosed by a wall somewhat higher than that of\nthe other fort. The principal buildings within it are a church, a parochial house, and a mortuary chapel surrounded by a cemetery. Both the forts have brass and iron cannon on the walls, some of which are mounted, and others either attached to old carriages or lying on the ground.\n\n**D\u00e1man-i-Koh.**\u2014A tract of hilly country, literally \u2018Skirts of the hills,\u2019 in the District of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal, and extending over portions of Dumk\u00e1, R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l, Pakaur, and Godda Sub-districts. Area, 1366 square miles, which was marked off by a ring fence in 1832. Number of villages, 2385; occupied houses, 60,052. The total population at the time of the Census of 1881 was 353,413, of whom 210,932 were Sant\u00e1ls, and 49,895 Kols and other aboriginal tribes, still professing their primitive faith. The balance of the population are also aboriginal by race, although most of them have adopted some form of Hinduism, and a few are converts to Muhammadanism and Christianity. The first Census in 1872 was taken in this tract by the headman of each village, by means of knotted strings of three colours, representing the males, females, and children separately. Each individual was \u2018knotted off,\u2019 while in some villages an independent committee kept a reckoning by seeds or small pieces of gravel, arranged in three sets upon the ground. The women and children apprehended some terrible natural visitation in consequence of this numbering of the people. In 1881, agitators seized the opportunity afforded by the Census for a tribal demonstration. Objection was made to the numbering of the houses and of the people. The circumstance that the final enumeration was to be taken by night gave rise to rumours that Government meditated some widespread policy of violence, and the hillmen worked themselves up into a state of great excitement. It was found necessary to dispense with the nocturnal enumeration, and by a show of force in marching detachments of troops through the Sant\u00e1l country, the Census was effected without disturbance.\n\nThe D\u00e1man-i-Koh is the property of Government, having been \u2018resumed\u2019 from the zamind\u00e1rs who held it between 1780 and 1839, when the last formal resumption was effected. It has been kept exclusively for the hill tribes, who were first found in it, and for the Sant\u00e1ls and other cognate primitive races who began to immigrate into it about 1820. Foreigners are not allowed to reside in this tract without special permission.\n\n**Dam-Dama.**\u2014Sub-division and cantonment, Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s District, Bengal.\u2014See DUM-DUM.\n\n**Dam-ma-tha.**\u2014A small town on the Gyaing river, in Amherst District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. To the south is an extensive outcrop of limestone rocks covered with dense forest, and pierced by a large cave, containing images of Buddha. These rocks\nterminate immediately below the village in an overhanging cliff, crowned by a pagoda; and between this and the village is the Government rest-house, with a flight of steps down to the Gyaing river. The massive and rugged Zweh-ka-bin limestone ridge, known as the 'Duke of York's Nose,' is situated to the north of Dam-ma-tha.\n\n**D\u00e1modar.**\u2014A river of Bengal; rises in the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur watershed, and, after a south-easterly course of about 350 miles, falls into the H\u00fagl\u00ed just above the ill-famed 'James and Mary Sands,' a shoal which it has helped to deposit at its mouth. The junction is in lat. 22\u00b0 17' N., long. 88\u00b0 7' 30\" E. Together with its tributaries, it forms the great line of drainage of the country stretching north-west from Calcutta to the fringe of the plateau of Central India. That plateau throws off to the eastward a confused mass of spurs and outliers, which in the Districts of Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh and Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 form a watershed, in the 84th degree of east longitude and 23rd of north latitude, of much, although inadequately recognised, significance in the hydrography of Bengal. The ridges culminate near Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 town in a well-defined barrier, with peaks up to 3476 feet. Two important river systems here take their rise in close proximity, and then diverge on widely-separated routes. The drainage from the north-western slopes flows northwards into the Son (Soane), the great river of Behar, which joins the Ganges between Patn\u00e1 and Bax\u00e1r, 500 miles above the spot where the waters from the eastern slopes, as represented by the southerly flowing D\u00e1modar, enter the H\u00fagl\u00ed. The Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh or Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 watershed, therefore, forms the western apex of a vast triangle, with the Son as its north-eastern, and the D\u00e1modar as its south-eastern sides, resting upon the Ganges as its eastern base. The sources of the D\u00e1modar are a two-pronged fork, approximately in 23\u00b0 35' to 24\u00b0 N. lat., and 84\u00b0 40' to 84\u00b0 55' E. long,\u2014the southern one, the true source, being in the Tori parg\u00e1n\u00e1 of Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 District; the northern one, the Garhi, in the north-west corner of Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh District. After a course of about 26 miles as wild mountain streams, the two prongs unite just within the western boundary of Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh; and the combined river flows through that District almost due east for 93 miles, receiving the Kunar, Jamuni\u00e1, and other affluents from the watershed on the north-west. It continues its course still eastward through M\u00e1nbh\u00fam, and receives its chief tributary, the Bar\u00e1khar, also from the north, at the point where it leaves that District and touches Bardw\u00e1n. A little lower down, the united stream becomes navigable, and assumes the dignity of an important river. At the point of junction it turns to the south-east, separating the R\u00e1niganj Sub-division of Bardw\u00e1n from B\u00e1nkur\u00e1; next entering Bardw\u00e1n District, it continues south-east to a little beyond Bardw\u00e1n town; then turns sharp to the right and flows almost due south for the remainder of its course through Bardw\u00e1n and H\u00fagl\u00ed.\nDistricts. Shortly before entering the latter, it assumes the deltaic type, and instead of receiving affluents, throws off distributaries, the best known being the K\u00e1n\u00e1 nad\u012b, which branches from the parent stream at S\u00e1lim\u00e1b\u00e1d in Bardw\u00e1n District, and finds its way as the Kunti nad\u012b into the H\u00fagl\u00ed near the village of Naw\u00e1 Sar\u00e1\u00ed. The main stream formerly debouched into the H\u00fagl\u00ed more directly and higher up than at present; its old mouth being now marked by the insignificant watercourse known as the K\u00e1nson\u00e1 khal. The D\u00e1modar thus exhibits in its comparatively short course the two great features of an Indian river. In the earlier part of its career it has a rapid flow, and brings down large quantities of silt. At the point of junction of the two prongs on the western border of Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh District, the united stream starts with an elevation of 1326 feet above sea-level. In its course of 93 miles through Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh, its fall averages 8 feet per mile (total, 744 feet), and it leaves the District with an elevation of only 582 feet to be distributed over its remaining course of about 250 miles. The fall continues rapidly through M\u00e1nbh\u00fam and north-western Bardw\u00e1n, in the latter of which Districts the D\u00e1modar deposits large and shifting sandbanks. In South Bardw\u00e1n and H\u00fagl\u00ed Districts it declines into a sluggish deltaic channel, and deposits the remainder of its silt at its point of junction with the H\u00fagl\u00ed river, opposite Falt\u00e1. The R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1y\u00e1n, a southern congener of the D\u00e1modar, from nearly the same watershed, also falls into the H\u00fagl\u00ed, a few miles lower down. Both streams enter the great river at a sharp angle from the west, and the \u2018James and Mary Sands\u2019 have been thrown up between their mouths. These sands are formed from the silt brought down by the H\u00fagl\u00ed and D\u00e1modar; the deposit of the suspended matter at this spot being caused by the freshets of the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1y\u00e1n, which dam up the H\u00fagl\u00ed by backwaters, thus checking its current and forcing it to drop its burden. During the dry season, the D\u00e1modar is only navigable as far as Ampta in Howrah District\u2014about 25 miles from its mouth\u2014by native boats of 10 tons burthen at neap, and of 20 tons at spring tides. In the rainy season it is navigable to near its point of junction with the Bar\u00e1khar, in the north-western extremity of Bardw\u00e1n District. A flotilla of 200 to 300 boats (p\u00e1ut\u00e1s), from 20 to 30 tons, built broad with strong transverse timbers to resist the strain caused by frequent grounding on sandbanks, brings down yearly about 40,000 tons of coal from the R\u00e1niganj mines, to d\u00e9p\u00f4ts at Maheshrekha in Howrah District, whence Calcutta is reached via the Ul\u00fab\u00e1ri\u00e1 Canal and the H\u00fagl\u00ed. In seasons of abundant and evenly-distributed rainfall, each boat can make two or three trips between June and October. The D\u00e1modar is subject to sudden freshets, which used to desolate the surrounding country in Bardw\u00e1n District. In 1770, a flood almost totally destroyed Bardw\u00e1n town, ruined the whole line of embankments, and caused a\nsevere local famine. In 1823, and again in 1855, inundations swept away the river-side villages, and the terror of a similar calamity has deterred the people from building on many of the deserted sites. 'Picture to yourself,' writes the *Calcutta Monthly Journal* in 1823, 'a flat country completely under water, running with a force apparently irresistible, and carrying with it dead bodies, roofs of houses, palanquins, and wreck of every description!' The floods lasted for three days, during which the fortunate owners of brick tenements camped on their roofs. The old landmarks of the peasants' holdings were swept away, and many years of bankruptcy and litigation ensued. Since the construction of the railway, which for a space follows the course of the D\u00e1modar, and the improvement of the river embankments, which Government took into its own hands after the flood of 1855, calamities on this scale have been unknown. The D\u00e1modar embankment now protects the country northwards of the river; but this embankment has had the effect of throwing the spill of the river over the unprotected country on the right bank, attended with serious damage to crops, and laying waste a large tract of formerly fertile land. Towards the south, where the D\u00e1modar and the Rupnarayan rivers converge upon the Hugli, there is a great tract of eight square miles subject to inundations from eight to eighteen feet in depth. The engineering difficulties incident to this flooded region formed one of the arguments for taking the direct railway from Calcutta to Bombay round by the Bar\u00e1kh\u00e1r route, instead of by the direct line across Midnapur District.\n\n**Damoh.**\u2014District in the Jabalpur Division of the Chief Commissionership of the Central Provinces, lying between $22^\\circ 10'$ and $23^\\circ 30'$ N. lat., and $79^\\circ 5'$ and $80^\\circ$ E. long. Bounded on the north by Bundelkhand; on the east by Jabalpur (Jubbulpore); on the south by Narsinghpur; and on the west by S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor). Population in 1881, 312,957 souls; area, 2799 square miles. The administrative headquarters of the District are at Damoh, which is also the principal town.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The contour of the District is irregular, and in parts ill-defined. To the south, a lofty range of sandstone hills separates Damoh from Narsinghpur and Jabalpur (Jubbulpore), and at places sends forth spurs and ridges into the plain below. But these elevations are as a rule insignificant in size, and add but little beauty to the landscape. On the east rise the Bhondl\u00e1 hills, which run eastwards till they are lost in the loftier range of the Bh\u00e1nrer mountains. The Vindhy\u00e1ch\u00e1l hills, which stretch for a considerable distance along the western boundary, though of no great height, form the most picturesque feature of the District\u2014from time to time opening out into broad uplands, thickly wooded with low jungle. In this part of Damoh the overlying trap of the S\u00e1g\u00e1r plateau is met with. From these ranges, which more or less distinctly mark it off on three sides, Damoh\nextends in a vast table-land, sloping gradually towards the north, till an abrupt dip in the surface occurs, beyond which the plains of Bundelkhand may be seen stretching far away into the distant horizon. Except on the south and east, where the offshoots from the surrounding hills and patches of jungle break up the country, the District consists, therefore, of open plains of varying degrees of fertility, interspersed with low ranges and isolated heights. The richest tracts lie in the centre. The gentle declivity of the surface, and the porous character of the prevailing sandstone formation, render the drainage excellent. All the streams flow from south to north. The Son\u00e1r and the Bairm\u00e1, the two principal rivers, traverse the entire length of the District, receiving in their progress the waters of the Beas (Bi\u00e1s), Kopr\u00e1, Gurayy\u00e1, and smaller tributaries, rolling with a rapid stream towards the northern boundary of Damoh. As it approaches the frontier, the Son\u00e1r takes a bend eastwards, and joins the Bairm\u00e1; the united stream then leaves Damoh behind it, and, after receiving the Ken, falls into the Jumna. Little use has yet been made of any of the rivers for irrigation, though in many places they offer great facilities for the purpose.\n\nHistory. \u2014 In early times, the Chandel R\u00e1jputs of Mahob\u00e1 in Bundelkhand administered the present Districts of S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Damoh by means of a deputy posted at Balihr\u00ed, in Jabalpur (Jubbulpore). Excepting a few temples known as marhs, of rude architecture, and entirely destitute of inscriptions, the Chandels have left no monuments of their rule. On the decay of the Chand\u00e9l R\u00e1j, about the end of the 11th century, the greater part of Damoh became dependent upon the Gond power, which had its seat at Khatol\u00e1, in Bundelkhand, until its subversion about 1500 by the notorious Bundel\u00e1 chief, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Barsingh Deva. The Muhammadan power made itself felt in Damoh from a very early period. A Persian inscription, formerly legible on the principal gateway of the town of Damoh, bore the date 775 A.H. (1373 A.D.). Two hundred years, however, elapsed from this time before the Muhammadans actually occupied the District. Their invasion met with little opposition, except at Narsinghgarh, where the Gonds made a show of resistance to Sh\u00e1h Taiyab, the commander of the Imperial forces. During the supremacy of the Muhammadans, Damoh, Narsinghgarh (or as they called it, Nasratgarh), and Lakhron\u00ed were the principal towns; and their presence may still be traced in the ruins of forts, tombs, and mosques. The Muhammadan element in the population is now insignificant both in numbers and in position; and though the K\u00e1z\u00eds of Narsinghgarh claim descent from Sh\u00e1h Taiyab, they have fallen so low that they are glad to take service as messengers and process-servers. When the Mughal Empire began to give way before the rising Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 power, the Muhammadans fast lost their hold over their outlying dependencies; and Chhatar S\u00e1l, the powerful\nR\u00e1j\u00e1 of Panna, took the opportunity to annex S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Damoh. The Gonds and other wild tribes, however, who held the more mountainous regions in the south and east of Damoh, never acknowledged his authority. In his time was built the fort of Hatta. In the year 1733, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chhatar S\u00e1l was forced to solicit the assistance of B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o Peshw\u00e1 to repel an invasion of the Naw\u00e1b of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d from the north. To repay the service then rendered, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chhatar S\u00e1l consented to the cession called the tethr\u00e1, by which all his territory was divided into three equal parts\u2014one for each of his two sons, and the remaining third for the Peshw\u00e1, whom he formally adopted. In this distribution, a part of Damoh was allotted to each of the three; but no long time elapsed before the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s wrested the whole of the District from the Bundel\u00e1s. From this period, Damoh continued subordinate to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 governors at S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor), until by the treaty of 1818 it was made over to the British. Under the plundering revenue system of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, wide tracts relapsed into jungle, and the cultivating classes sank into a state of hopeless poverty. Half a century of British administration has now brought about a new era of prosperity for Damoh. Our earlier land settlements, based on the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 records, pressed heavily on the agricultural population; but this error has been rectified, and the District now enjoys a light assessment and fixed tenures. The result has already manifested itself in the spread of cultivation, and in the high market value of land, in some cases exceeding thirty years\u2019 purchase. The official records of Damoh were destroyed in the disturbances of 1857.\n\nPopulation.\u2014A rough enumeration in 1866 returned the population of Damoh at 262,641; and a more careful Census in 1872 at 269,642. The last Census, in 1881, returned the population of the District, covering the same area as in 1872, at 312,957, showing an increase of 43,315, or 16 per cent., in the nine years. This increase is to a considerable extent due to immigration caused by the famine of 1877, when a large number of refugees from the Native States to the north settled down permanently in the District; and also to the importation of labour for the new road from Damoh to Jabalpur. The results exhibited by the Census of 1881 may be briefly summarized as follows: Area of District, 2799 square miles, with 2 towns and 1144 villages; number of houses, 73,602, of which 70,276 were occupied and 3326 unoccupied. Total population, 312,957, namely, 162,570 males and 150,387 females. Average density, 112 persons per square mile; towns and villages per square mile, 0\u00b741; persons per town or village, 272; houses per square mile, 25\u00b711; persons per occupied house, 4\u00b745. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Hindus, 288,894; Jains, 6665; Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds, 2423; Satn\u00e1m\u00eds, 137; Muhammadans, 9384; Christians, 33; and tribes professing aboriginal religions, 5421.\nOf the Hindus, the high castes, represented by the Br\u00e1hmans and R\u00e1jputs, number 32,580. Of the lower castes, the best agriculturists are the K\u00farm\u00eds, who are said to have emigrated from the Do\u00e1b of the Ganges and Jumna into the Central Provinces over two centuries ago. In 1881 they numbered 23,635 in Damoh District, being found mostly in the rich black-soil tracts. They are a peaceable class, and have always been remarkable for their loyalty to the ruling power. They are very tenacious of their ancestral holdings, and seldom alienate their landed rights, except under the greatest pressure. Scarcely inferior to the K\u00farm\u00eds as agriculturists are the Lodh\u00eds, who form the most numerous caste in the District (36,897 in number in 1881); they are descendants of immigrants from Bundelkhand nearly three centuries ago. They differ greatly from the K\u00farm\u00eds in temperament, being turbulent, revengeful, and always ready to join in any disturbance. They make good soldiers, and are generally excellent sportsmen. The aboriginal tribe of Gonds (33,499 in number) and Ahirs (15,796) appear in this part of the country to have entirely lost their nationality, and to have become completely Hinduized. They are the only tribes which inhabit the wooded and hilly portions of the District, and are generally poor, of unsettled habits, and indifferent agriculturists. In the plains they are principally employed as farm labourers. The Kachhis (14,848 in number) are a superior class of cultivators akin to the K\u00farm\u00eds, and raise good crops of sugar-cane and garden produce. They are also field labourers. The lowest castes of Hindus include Cham\u00e1rs (35,976), who are workers in leather, labourers, etc.; Chand\u00e1ls (7558), weavers, field labourers, and village watchmen; and Dhim\u00e1ls (10,239), fishermen, water-carriers, domestic servants, etc. The Muhammadan element amounts to only 3 per cent. of the population, and is composed mainly of the lower orders, who are employed as cotton carders, weavers, etc. They belong, almost without exception, to the Sunn\u00ed sect.\n\nDivision into Town and Country.\u2014There are only two towns in Damoh District with a population exceeding 5000\u2014viz. DAMOH, the District headquarters (population in 1881, 8665), and HATTA (6325), and these form the only municipalities. Of the 1146 villages and towns, 661 contained in 1881 less than two hundred inhabitants; 349 had from two to five hundred; 97 from five hundred to a thousand; 29 from one to two thousand; 6 from two to three thousand; 2 from three to five thousand; and 2 upwards of five thousand inhabitants. As regards occupation, the Census Report classifies the male population into the following six main divisions:\u2014Class I. Professional, including civil and military and learned professions, 3245; II. Domestic servants, lodging-house keepers, etc., 2023; III. Commercial, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 2958; IV. Agricultural, including\ncultivators, gardeners, and sheep and cattle tenders, 61,208; V. Industrial class, including manufacturers, artisans, etc., 25,818; VI. Indefinite and non-productive, including ordinary labourers and male children, 67,318.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of 2799 square miles, only 810 square miles were cultivated in 1881-82, and of the portion lying waste, 684 square miles were returned as cultivable. Only 1147 acres were irrigated\u2014entirely by private enterprise. Wheat constitutes the principal crop, being grown in 1881-82 on 244,583 acres, while 199,724 acres were devoted to other food-grains. Rice and oil-seeds form the only other important produce. The cultivation of cotton is small, and the produce is used principally for local consumption. The average rent of land suited for wheat is 5s. per acre; for inferior grain, 3s.; for rice, 2s. 9d.; and for oil-seeds, 3s. The produce per acre averages\u2014wheat, 452 lbs.; inferior grains, 305; rice, 377; and oil-seeds, 281 lbs. The average prices in 1881 per cwt. were\u2014wheat, 3s. 9d.; rice, 6s. 7d.; linseed, 5s. 9d.; and inferior food-grains, 2s. 9d. The usual wages for skilled labour amounted to 1s. per diem; for unskilled labour, from 3d. to 6d. The total agricultural adult population, including agricultural labourers, in 1881 was 89,359, or 28\u00b755 per cent. of the total District population. Total assessed area, 1903 square miles, paying a total revenue to Government of \u00a328,379, or an average of 1s. per acre of cultivated, and 7\u00bdd. per acre of cultivable land. The total amount of rent, including cesses, paid by the cultivators to the landlords, was \u00a366,769, or an average of 2s. 6d. per acre. Average area of cultivable and cultivated land per head of the agricultural population, 11 acres.\n\nThe best agriculturists are the K\u00farm\u00eds, who are said to have immigrated from the Do\u00e1b about 250 years ago. The circumstance that their women engage in field-work equally with the men contributes in no slight degree to their success. A most peaceable race, and remarkable for their loyalty to the ruling power, the K\u00farm\u00eds are exceedingly tenacious of their ancestral holdings, and will hardly alienate their rights in land under the greatest pressure. The Lodh\u00eds, who rank next as agriculturists, made their way into the District about three centuries ago. Often turbulent and revengeful, they form good soldiers, and are generally excellent sportsmen. Both K\u00farm\u00eds and Lodh\u00eds make no distinction between a mistress and a wife, provided the former is of the same caste as her partner, or, what is more respectable still, the widow of an elder brother or cousin. The children born from such connections inherit property, of whatever kind, equally with those born of regularly-married wives. In the wooded and hilly portions of Damoh, many Gonds pursue agriculture after a humble fashion; in the plains they are principally employed as farm servants. Of the 71 villages held by Muhammadans, 63 are in possession of one family,\nwho obtained a whole taluk in proprietary right as a reward for loyal services rendered during the Mutiny.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014The chief trade of the District is conducted at the annual fairs held at Kundalpur and Bandakpur. The Kundalpur fair takes place in March, beginning with the yearly gathering of Jains, immediately after the Holi festival, and lasts a fortnight. It owes its origin to the Jain temple erected at Kundalpur by the Purwar Baniyas, to which the neighbouring Jains resorted to worship Neminath, and to settle caste disputes. In these adjudications, the delinquents often incur fines, which supply a fund for the repairs of the temple, and for embellishing the place with tanks and groves. The fairs at Bandakpur are held in January and February, at the Basantpanchum\u00ed and Siva-r\u00e1tr\u00ed festivals respectively, when crowds of devotees visit the place for the purpose of pouring water from the Ganges or Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) on the image of Jageswar Mah\u00e1deva, in fulfilment of vows made for prayers granted, or favours solicited. Of the offerings made to the god on these occasions, to the value of nearly \u00a31200 in the year, one-fourth becomes the property of the priests. The proprietor of the temple claims the remaining three-fourths, and is said to expend his share on religious objects. This temple was erected in 1781 by the father of Nagoji Ball\u00e1l, a respectable Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 pandit of Damoh, in obedience to a dream, which revealed to him that at a certain spot in the village of Bandakpur an image of Jageswar Mah\u00e1deva lay buried. There he built a temple; and in due time, as the vision foretold, the image arose without the help of man. The fame of this occurrence has attracted throngs of pilgrims, and consequently of traders; and, in 1881, the attendance amounted to 70,000 persons. Piece-goods manufactured at Mari\u00e1-Doh, hardware, with trinkets made at Hindori\u00e1 and Pater\u00e1, form the articles chiefly dealt in. The import traffic on the north-east frontier is considerable, consisting of European and country-made piece-goods, betel, cocoa-nuts, hardware, tobacco, spices, rum, and sugar from Mirzapur and the north-west. But a great proportion of these goods merely passes through the District on the way to S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Bhop\u00e1l. On the other hand, the Banj\u00e1ras bring large quantities of salt from the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na salt lakes, by way of S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Damoh, to supply the markets of Bundelkhand. The exports consist of wheat, gram, rice, hides, ghi, cotton, and coarse cloth. The total length of made roads in the District is returned at 40 miles of first class, 93 miles of the second, and 139 of the third class. The principal road is that connecting the military station of S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) with the town of Jabalpur (Jubbulpore). For the 40 miles of its course which lie within this District it is partially bridged, and all the streams it crosses are fordable. The shorter line which joins S\u00e1g\u00e1r with Jok\u00e1i on the Mirzapur road, traversing Damoh for 30 miles, should become an important railway feeder.\nThe only other important line runs from Damoh towards Nagode via Hatta, and supplies the route for commerce with M\u00edrz\u00e1pur and the Upper Provinces. Besides these roads, two tracks start from the north-east and north-west of the District, along which the Banj\u00e1r\u00e1s drive their trains of pack-bullocks, laden with grain for the markets of Bundelkhand.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Damoh was first formed into a separate District under the British Government of the Central Provinces in 1861. It is administered by a European Deputy Commissioner with an Assistant Commissioner and tahsild\u00e1rs. Total revenue in 1881\u201382, \u00a338,094, of which the land revenue yielded \u00a326,676. Total cost of District officials and police of all kinds, \u00a310,188. Number of civil and revenue judges of all sorts within the District, 5; of magistrates, 8; maximum distance from any village to the nearest court, 50 miles; average distance, 25 miles. Number of police, 382 men (costing \u00a34812), being 1 policeman to about every 7'3 square miles and to 819 inhabitants. The daily average number of convicts in jail in 1881\u201382 was 44'33, of whom 4'10 were females. In the same year the number of Government or aided schools in the District under inspection was 50, attended by a total of 2386 pupils, besides a number of uninspected indigenous schools. The District English school at Damoh town was attended by 218 pupils. The Census Report of 1881 returned a total of 2853 boys and 130 girls as under instruction, besides 6575 men and 81 women not under instruction, but able to read and write.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate may be pronounced fairly healthy. The temperature is lower than is usual in the Districts of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) valley, and the hot winds prove milder and of shorter duration than in Upper India. All the year round, the nights are cool. In the winter it generally rains, and then the weather becomes really cold, and sharp frosts sometimes occur. Rainfall in 1881\u201382, 42'03 inches; annual average, 56'30 inches. Average temperature in the shade at the civil station for the three years ending 1881:\u2014May, highest reading 107\u00b0 F., lowest 67'7\u00b0; July, highest reading 90'7\u00b0, lowest 71'2\u00b0; December, highest reading 73'7\u00b0, lowest 35'7\u00b0. Cholera sometimes sweeps over the District. Small-pox carries off large numbers of children, but appears to be now on the decrease. Vaccination is being steadily pushed on, 11,753 persons having been vaccinated in 1881\u201382. Fevers are generally prevalent, especially at the conclusion of the monsoon. Those of an intermittent type are the most common forms of the disease. Ophthalmia is very common, as also is guinea-worm. In 1881, 10,661 deaths from all causes were registered, at the ratio of about 35 per 1000 of the population. There were 27 cases of suicide, of which 16 were of women; 94 persons died from snake-bite, or were killed by wild beasts. In the same year, 5 charitable dispensaries afforded medical relief to 14,290 patients. [For further information\nregarding Damoh District, see the *Central Provinces Gazetteer* (1870), the *Census Report* of 1881, and the *Administration Reports of the Central Provinces*, 1882\u201384.\n\n**Damoh.**\u2014Tahsil or revenue sub-division in Damoh District, Central Provinces. Lat. 23\u00b0 9' to 24\u00b0 27' N., long. 77\u00b0 57' to 79\u00b0 24' E. Area, 1792 square miles, of which 476 are cultivated, 420 cultivable, and 896 uncultivable. Population (1881) 187,897, namely, 97,405 males and 90,492 females, residing in 698 towns and villages, and occupying 34,986 houses; average density, 105 persons per square mile. Amount of Government assessment, \u00a314,481, or an average of 11\u00bdd. per acre of cultivation. Rental paid by cultivators, including cesses, \u00a339,161, or an average of 2s. 7d. per cultivated acre. The tahsil contains 4 civil and 7 criminal courts, including the head-quarters courts; with 5 police and 9 outpost stations; strength of regular police, 140 men; village watchmen (*chaukidars*), 484.\n\n**Damoh.**\u2014Chief town and administrative head-quarters of Damoh District. Lat. 23\u00b0 50' N., long. 79\u00b0 29' 30\" E., on the high road between S\u00e1gar (Saugor) and Jabalpur (Jubbulpore), and between S\u00e1gar and Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d via Jok\u00e1i. Population (1881) 8665, namely, 4390 males and 4275 females. The Hindu population, consisting chiefly of Lodh\u00eds, K\u00farm\u00eds, and Br\u00e1hmans, numbered 7027; Muhammadans, 1275; Jains, 311; Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds, 39; and Christians, 13. The porous sandstone on which the town is built does not easily retain water, and there are but few wells; thus, in spite of the fine tank called the Phutera T\u00e1l, good water is scarce. The temperature is considerably increased by radiation from the bluffs near Damoh. There are but few buildings of any interest, most of the old Hindu temples having been destroyed by the Muhammadans, and their materials used to construct a fort, which in its turn has been destroyed.\n\n**D\u00e1msang.**\u2014Tract of country, D\u00e1rjiling District, Bengal.\u2014See DALINGKOT.\n\n**D\u00e1ngs, The.**\u2014Tract of country, situated within the limits of the Political Agency of Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency. Bounded north-west by the petty State of Wars\u00e1vi in the Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1nth Agency; on the north-east by the British Districts of Kh\u00e1ndesh and N\u00e1sik; on the south by N\u00e1sik District; and on the west by the B\u00e1ns\u00e1 State in Surat District. The D\u00e1ngs consist of 15 petty States, ruled by Bh\u00edl chieftains, extending from 20\u00b0 22' to 21\u00b0 5' N. latitude, and from 73\u00b0 28' to 73\u00b0 52' E. longitude. The extreme length from north to south is 52 miles, and the breadth 28 miles. Estimated area about 1000 square miles; population (1881) 45,485; estimated gross revenue of all the chiefs, \u00a33100 (chiefly derived from dues on timber).\n\nThe country is covered with dense forest, intersected in all directions by precipitous ravines and rugged mountains, the general slope being\ntowards the west. The rainfall is heavy; and the air of the valleys, walled in on all sides by steep hill ranges, is close and hot. The water obtained from pools and wells is always full of decaying vegetable matter. From these causes the climate is singularly unhealthy. Except for a few months, from March to May, or during the driest season of the year, no European, and only the hardiest races of natives, can remain in the D\u00e1ngs. The valleys contain tracts of rich black loam, but the soil on the uplands is the poorer variety of red. None of the mineral resources have as yet been ascertained. Of vegetable products, teak and other timber-trees are by far the most important. With the exception of a little rice and pulse, the crops are confined to the inferior varieties of mountain grains. In the west or Lower D\u00e1ngs, the valleys and ravine-sides are too densely wooded to be habitable; the few villages and hamlets are generally found on the more open flat-topped spurs and ridges. In the east the country is more open. There are no roads properly so called, but there are 4 principal cart-tracks. The inhabitants of the D\u00e1ngs belong almost entirely to the wild forest tribes. Most of them are Bh\u00edls, who, accompanied by herds of sheep and goats, move about from place to place, supporting themselves in great measure on game and the natural products of the forest. Under the former Native Governments, the Bh\u00edls were the terror of the neighbouring Districts, and on occasions the most indiscriminate vengeance was taken on them in return for their habitual depredations. After the occupation of Kh\u00e1ndesh by the British in 1818, anarchy was at its height. The roads were impassable, villages were plundered, and murders committed daily, the only protection the inhabitants of the plain could obtain being through regular payment of black-mail. An expedition was sent into the D\u00e1ng country; but at the end of three months, less than half the force marched back into Malig\u00e1on, the others having succumbed to the malaria of the jungle. At that time, Captain (afterwards Sir James) Outram came among the Bh\u00edls. First conciliating them with feasts and his prowess in tiger-shooting, he eventually succeeded in forming a Bh\u00edl corps, originally based on 9 men who had accompanied him on shooting expeditions. In 1827, this Bh\u00edl corps had reached 600 rank and file, who fought boldly for the Government and suppressed plundering. The District treasuries are now under their charge, and the chief police rests in their hands. The tribe next in importance to the Bh\u00edls is called Konk\u00e1n\u00ed. They are somewhat more settled in their habits and more inclined to agriculture, though little superior to the Bh\u00edls in appearance. The language of both these tribes is a mixture of Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed, Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, and Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed, in which the last predominates. Education is in a very backward state. In the whole D\u00e1ngs, not more than half-a-dozen persons can read and write.\nThere are fifteen petty chiefs in the D\u00e1ng country, whose States are returned (1881) as follows:\n\n| Name of State       | Estimated Population | Supposed Revenue |\n|---------------------|----------------------|------------------|\n| D\u00e1ng Pimpri         | 3,572                | Rs. 3,106        |\n| ,, Wadhw\u00e1n          | 253                  | 147              |\n| ,, Ketak Kadupada   | 218                  | 155              |\n| ,, Am\u00e1l\u00e1            | 5,361                | 2,885            |\n| ,, Chinchli         | 1,668                | 601              |\n| ,, Pimpl\u00e1devi       | 134                  | 120              |\n| ,, Pal\u00e1sbihar       | 223                  | 230              |\n| ,, Auchar           | 513                  | 201              |\n| ,, Derbhauti        | 4,891                | 3,649            |\n| ,, G\u00e1rvi            | 6,309                | 5,125            |\n| ,, Shivb\u00e1ra         | 346                  | 422              |\n| ,, Kirli            | 167                  | 512              |\n| ,, W\u00e1surn\u00e1          | 6,177                | 2,275            |\n| ,, Dhude (Bilb\u00e1ri)  | 1,448                | 85               |\n| ,, Surg\u00e1na          | 14,205               | 11,469           |\n| **Total**           | **45,485**           | **30,982**       |\n\nOf these petty estates, fourteen are held by Bhils, and one by a Kunbi. Four of the petty chieftains claim the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1; the others are called N\u00e1yaks. They are all practically independent, though a nominal superiority is awarded to the G\u00e1rvi chief, under whose banner the rest are bound to serve in time of war. In former times, the G\u00e1rvi chief was, in common with the other D\u00e1ng chiefs, tributary to the Deshmukh of Malhar, a strong fort in the B\u00e1gl\u00e1n Sub-division of N\u00e1sik District. But the oppression exercised by the Deshmukh in collecting his annual tribute of \u00a370 gave rise to such frequent disturbances, that the British Government was induced to deduct the amount from the sums now paid to the D\u00e1ng chiefs for the leases of their forests, and hand it over direct to the representative of the Deshmukh.\n\nThe administration of justice, civil and criminal, in the D\u00e1ngs is vested in the Collector of Kh\u00e1ndesh as *ex officio* Political Agent; capital sentences, or those involving more than fourteen years\u2019 imprisonment, being referred for the confirmation of Government. Petty cases are settled by the R\u00e1j\u00e1s and N\u00e1yaks themselves, each in his own jurisdiction, the punishments inflicted being chiefly fines in money and cattle. None of the D\u00e1ng chiefs possesses a *sanad* authorizing adoption, and the succession in all cases follows the rule of primogeniture. The whole area of the D\u00e1ngs is leased to Government in perpetuity, but the lease may be relinquished at any time on giving six months\u2019 notice. [See also separate article on the Bhil tribe.]\nD\u00e1ngurl\u0131.\u2014Small zamind\u00e1ri or estate on the left bank of the Waingang\u00e1 river, in Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. 21\u00b0 36' N., and long. 80\u00b0 11' E.; and containing only one village. Area, 1905 acres, of which 1176 acres are cultivated, producing a large quantity of the castor-oil plant. The chief claims to be a R\u00e1jput. Population (1881) 777.\n\nDankar.\u2014Picturesque village in K\u00e1ngr\u00e1 District, Punjab, and capital of the Spiti tract. Lat. 32\u00b0 5' 30\" N., long. 78\u00b0 15' 15\" E. Stands at an elevation of 12,774 feet above sea-level, on a spur or bluff which juts into the main valley, ending in a precipitous cliff. The softer parts of the hill have been denuded by the action of the weather, leaving blocks and columns of a hard conglomerate, among which the houses are curiously perched in quaint and inconvenient positions. Overtopping the whole rises a rude fort, belonging to Government; while a Buddhist monastery stands on a side of the hill. The inhabitants are pure Tibetans. Dankar has formed the seat of Government for the Spiti valley from time immemorial.\n\nDankaur.\u2014Ancient town with a good market in Bulandshahr District, Meerut Division, North-Western Provinces. Situated in lat. 28\u00b0 21' 25\" N., long. 77\u00b0 35' 35\" E., on the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1), which now flows two miles to the south, but which formerly flowed close under it; distant from Bulandshahr 20 miles south-west, on the old imperial road from Delhi to Aligarh. Population (1881) 5122, namely, Hindus 3984, and Muhammadans 1138; area of town site, 125 acres. Founded according to tradition by Drona or Dona, a hero of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, from whom the town derives its name. A few ruinous fragments exist of a large fort, built by Kayam-ud-d\u00edn Kh\u00e1n in the reign of Akbar, with a mosque of more modern construction. In front of the little shrine erected in honour of the traditional founder, is a masonry tank 210 feet square constructed in 1881, and supplied with water from the Jumna canal. Police station, post-office, village school. Traffic by Makanpur gh\u00e1t passes through Dankaur. A small municipal revenue for conservancy purposes, etc., is levied under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856.\n\nDanki\u00e1.\u2014Mountain in the north of the Chhola range, Sikkim, Bengal; height, 23,176 feet; situated 50 miles east-north-east of K\u00e1nchanjang\u00e1. Lat. 27\u00b0 57' 30\" N., long. 88\u00b0 52' 15\" E. Although the Danki\u00e1 mountain is 5000 feet lower than K\u00e1nchanjang\u00e1, it is the culminating-point of a much more extensive and elevated mass. An immense range, with an average elevation of 18,500 feet, runs for thirty miles, and thence turns south-west to K\u00e1nchanjang\u00e1, the river Zemu breaking through at an elevation of 13,000 feet at the bend. The range is again broken through by the Lachen river at a height of 14,000 feet, sixteen miles west of the Danki\u00e1 peak. The well-known but little-frequented\nDanki\u00e1 pass (elevation, 18,400 feet), at the head of the Lachung valley, is four miles west of the Danki\u00e1 peak.\n\n**D\u00e1nta.**\u2014State under the Political Agency of M\u00e1hi K\u00e1ntha, in the Province of Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency. Comprises 78 villages, and marches with P\u00e1lanpur and Sirohi. A wild and hilly country, with an estimated population (1882) of 17,456; approximate gross revenue, \u00a32700, inclusive of transit dues. Tribute\u2014\u00a3237 to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda; \u00a351 to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Idar; \u00a350 to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of P\u00e1lanpur. Chief crops\u2014millet, Indian corn, wheat, and sugar-cane: area under tillage, 15,000 acres. Marble is found and quarried in D\u00e1nta. Manufactures are inconsiderable. There is 1 school, with 51 pupils in 1882. The Chief is a Hindu and a Parm\u00e1r R\u00e1jput by caste; his title is R\u00e1n\u00e1; and his State ranks among those of the second class. In matters of succession, the family, which has held semi-independent power since 1069 A.D., follows the rule of primogeniture, and does not hold a sanad authorizing adoption. The Amba Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed shrine, famous throughout India, is situated in this territory. A great portion of the Chief's revenue is derived from the costly offerings of the pious at the shrine. Pilgrims of all ranks visit the place during August, September, October, and November. The history of D\u00e1nta has been mainly a record of continual struggles with the neighbouring State of Idar. Together with all the adjoining region, D\u00e1nta formerly experienced the incursions of one foreign dynasty after another\u2014Khilji, Mughal, and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1.\n\n**D\u00e1nta.**\u2014Chief town of the State of D\u00e1nta, Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency; 38 miles east of Disa (Deesa), and 136 miles north of Baroda. Lat. 24\u00b0 12\u2032 15\u2033 N., long. 72\u00b0 49\u2032 30\u2033 E.\n\n**Dantew\u00e1ra.**\u2014Village in Bast\u00e1r Feudatory State, Central Provinces; situated in lat. 18\u00b0 54\u2032 N., long. 81\u00b0 23\u2032 30\u2033 E., at the confluence of the Dank\u00e1n\u00ed and Sank\u00e1n\u00ed rivers, and to the west of the Bel\u00e1 D\u00edl\u00e1s, a lofty range of hills. About 60 miles from Jagdalpur, and 120 from Sironcha, on the direct route between these places. Population, about 300. Famed for its temple to Danteswari or Kali, the patron goddess of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Bast\u00e1r, where human sacrifices were practised of old.\n\n**D\u00e1ntun.**\u2014Chief village in the pargan\u00e1 of the same name in Midnapur District, Bengal. Seat of a munsif's and of a sub-registrar's court; considerable trade in cloth, made of tasar and cotton, manufactured in Morbhanj State and within the District.\n\n**Dan\u00fat-Pay\u00e1-gyi.**\u2014A vast pagoda, now in ruins, in Twan-te township, Hanthawadi District, British Burma. It was formerly the site of a flourishing village, but there are no records extant bearing upon the history of either village or pagoda.\n\n**Da-nwun.**\u2014A tidal creek in Shwelaung township, Thungwa District, Irawadi (Irrawaddy) Division, British Burma. Navigable by river\nsteamers. With the Irawadi it forms an island on which stands the village of Kyunpyathat. Lat. $16^\\circ 25'$ N., long. $95^\\circ 12' 30''$ E.\n\n**Daphla (or Duffla) Hills.**\u2014A tract of hilly country on the north-east frontier of India, occupied by an independent tribe called Daphl\u00e1, akin to the Abars, the Akas, and the Mir\u00eds. It lies north of Darrang and Lakhimpur Districts, in the Province of Assam; bounded west by the Aka Hills, and east by the Abar range. The westward boundary is formed by the Bhoroli river, the eastward by the Sundri. The whole Daphla country is only some 60 miles from east to west and 40 from north to south, the inhabited hills varying in height from 2000 to 7000 feet. The Daphlas are divided into two clans\u2014the Tagin Daphlas, whose villages border on Lakhimpur; and the Paschim Daphlas, living on the Darrang frontier. According to the Assam Census Report of 1881, the total number of Daphlas in British territory was 549, confined to Lakhimpur and Darrang Districts. They are of recent settlement in the plains, and of late years have been coming down in small communities of five or six families at a time, driven by scarcity or by the oppressions of the Abars. They assert a superiority over the Mir\u00eds, and repudiate any relationship with them, although they practically speak the same language, and their deities Yap\u00fam and Orom are the same, and are propitiated by sacrifices of a white goat or a fowl. Their great god, however, who requires a *mithan* (a species of wild cow) to propitiate him, is called Ui or Wi, of whom no Daphla cares to speak much for fear of incurring his displeasure. While repudiating any connection with the Mir\u00eds, the Daphlas claim a close relationship with the Abars, the most powerful of the three tribes. The Daphlas are less laborious cultivators than the Mir\u00eds. Their villages are not so well stocked, nor so comfortable, nor are the men so tall as the Mir\u00eds, although the eastern Daphlas are physically fine fellows. Going westwards, however, the race degenerates in physique and in outward appearances of prosperity, and the westernmost Daphlas are squalid and dirty. Cultivation is carried on both on the nomadic system of *jum*, and permanently in terraced and irrigated lands in the Ranga valley, the chief crops being rice, Indian corn, tobacco, chillies, pulses, yams, pumpkins, poppy, and sesamum. The villages in their own hills vary in size from 10 to 200 houses, the houses being sometimes from 40 to 60 feet long, and built on bamboo platforms (*chang*). As many as 150 people often live in one house, but many families live separately in small houses. Polygamy is practised when a man can afford a plurality of wives; but polyandry is exceedingly common. The Daphlas bury their dead, and build a small hut over the grave in which they place water and food for five days. They mourn the dead for two days, and the bearers of the corpse to the grave are given two months' holiday from work.\nThe costume of the men consists generally of a wicker-work helmet with a plume of magpie feathers, but some of the chiefs wear a cylinder of silver round their heads. A cloth is worn tied crossways in front and round the waist and passed between the legs. Many wear a number of cane rings round the waist, arms, and legs, as a protection against sword-cuts. Their weapons consist of a long straight sword or *d\u00e1o*, slung round the neck by a piece of string, a bow and arrows, and occasionally a long spear. The term Daphla, which is of uncertain derivation, is that applied to them by the Assamese; they call themselves Niso or Nising. Their political constitution is based upon an excessive subdivision of authority. There are as many as 388 *g\u00e1ms*, or village chiefs, in receipt of *pos\u00e1* or commuted black-mail from the British Government, to the total annual amount of \u00a3347. In former times the Daphlas were notorious for their raids upon the inhabitants of the plains. At the beginning of the present century, the northern valley of the Brahmaputra was entirely depopulated by the terror thus spread; and during the early years of British administration, the passes leading from the Daphla Hills were regularly blockaded by military outposts. Recently, however, the Daphlas have shown a more peaceable disposition.\n\nIn return for the annual payment of *pos\u00e1*, they have kept the peace along their own frontier, and a trade has sprung up between them and the Assamese. In 1872 there was an unfortunate recurrence of their old practices. A party of independent Daphlas, of the Tagin clan, suddenly attacked a colony of their own tribesmen, who had settled at Amtol\u00e1, in British territory, and carried away 44 captives to the hills. The motive of this raid was a belief that an outbreak of disease among them was introduced from the plains. During the next two years the hill passes were blockaded by police and soldiers, but with no result. In the cold season of 1874\u201375, an armed expedition was marched into the hills. No serious opposition was encountered; all the captives that survived were released, and an excellent effect has been produced upon the hill tribes.\n\n**D\u00e1poli.** \u2014 Sub-division of Ratnagiri District, Bombay Presidency. D\u00e1poli is the most northern of the Sub-divisions of the District. Bounded on the east by Kol\u00e1ba and Khed; on the north by Janjira and Kol\u00e1ba; on the south by the river V\u00e1shishti, which separates D\u00e1poli from Chiplun; and on the west by the Arabian Sea. The area is not yet fully surveyed. The Census of 1881 shows an area of 505 square miles, with a population of 141,012 persons, dwelling in 247 villages. Males number 65,846; females 75,166, or more than 53 per cent. In point of religion the population is thus distributed:\u2014Hindus, 123,836, or more than 87 per cent. of the whole; Muhammadans, 16,880; of other religions not specified, 296. As in other parts of the Presidency, the different castes represent various artisan classes and trade guilds.\nKunbis, or cultivators, predominate; the M\u00e1ngs, Mh\u00e1rs, and Bhangis constitute the inferior and depressed castes.\n\nThe Khed Sub-division separates D\u00e1poli from the Sahy\u00e1d\u00ed range of hills. The seaboard of D\u00e1poli, stretching for thirty miles, has the characteristics of other parts of the Konkan coast; bluff headlands stand at the mouths of the chief rivers, and the coast-line is indented with small and sandy bays. The coast villages, dotted over the low belts of sand lying between the sea and the cliffs, are thickly peopled, and are concealed in dense groves of palm. B\u00e1nkot and D\u00e1bhol are the extremities of the seaboard, and are situated at the estuaries of the two main rivers of the Sub-division, the S\u00e1vitri and the V\u00e1shishti. Along the coast lie Harnai, a good harbourage from northerly winds, and opposite Harnai the island fortress of Suvarndurg. Inland, the aspect of the Sub-division is bleak and rugged. Boulders of laterite crop out over the bare plateaux of the region, and lie in the innumerable watercourses of long dried-up streams. Eastward the prospect improves. The villages are shaded by clumps of jack and mango trees. Teak grows in some of the more sheltered ravines; and the river banks are covered with brushwood. The climate on the whole is temperate and healthy. The sea-breeze is felt in all parts of the Sub-division. Annual average temperature for the eight years ending 1878, 76\u00b0 F.; average rainfall for the ten years ending 1877, 112 inches. There are no canals or other irrigation works. The water required is raised from wells by bullock-draught. A small portion of alluvial soil is found on the banks of the rivers and on the flats formed by deposits at their estuaries. A good deal of salt marsh and tidal swamp has been turned into fertile gardens and productive rice-fields. The dry-crop soil is poor and unproductive. Agricultural stock (1879)\u2014oxen, 22,000; cows, 16,200; buffaloes, 7700; sheep and goats, 6273; horses, 60; ploughs, 10,000. The Sub-division contains 1 civil and 3 criminal courts; police stations, 7; regular police, 83. Chief town, D\u00e1poli.\n\nD\u00e1poli.\u2014Head-quarters of D\u00e1poli Sub-division, Ratnagiri District, Bombay Presidency. About 5 miles distant from the sea, with an elevation of 620 feet. One of the healthiest localities in the Konkan.\n\nD\u00e1raganj.\u2014Suburb of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d city, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 25\u00b0 41' N., long. 81\u00b0 25' E., on the right bank of the Ganges, on Akbar\u2019s bandh or embankment, east of the Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d peninsula. Although shown in the Census Report as a separate town, it is in reality a part of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d city, being included within its municipal limits, guarded by the city police, and within the jurisdiction of the city magistrate. Distant two miles from Kydganj, the nearest point of the city proper, and connected with it by the Grand Trunk Road. Population of Daraganj (1881) 13,159, namely, Hindus, 11,085; Muhammadans, 2073; Christian, 1. Area, 149 acres.\nD\u00e1rapur.\u2014Village in Jehlam (Jhelum) District, Punjab; situated in lat. $32^\\circ 46' N.$, long. $73^\\circ 36' E.$, about a mile from the right or west bank of the Jhelum river, just below its junction with the Bunh\u00e1r torrent. The neighbouring ruins of Udainagar were identified by Burnes with those of Nic\u00e6a, built by Alexander to commemorate his victory over Porus. General Cunningham, however, with greater probability, places the site of Alexander's great battle at Jalalpur.\n\nD\u00e1rapur.\u2014T\u00e1luk and town in Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Dh\u00e1rapuram.\n\nDarauti.\u2014Village in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal; 5 miles north-east of R\u00e1mgarh. Contains some old remains attributed to the Suars or Savir\u00e1s. Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton conjectures, from the style of this work, that the Cher\u00fas once had a temple here, and that the obelisks now left standing commemorate its destruction by the Suars.\n\nDarbelo.\u2014Town in the Naushahro Sub-division, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. The population, which is below 2000, consists mainly of agriculturists, the Muhammadans being of the Kalhora and P\u00edr tribes, the Hindus chiefly Loh\u00e1nos. Annual export of grain, by the Naulakhi Canal, valued at \u00a32000.\n\nDarbhanga.\u2014District in the Patn\u00e1 Division or Commissionership of Behar, under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, forming the eastern portion of the old District of Tirhut. It extends from $25^\\circ 30'$ to $26^\\circ 40'$ N. lat., and from $85^\\circ 35'$ to $86^\\circ 45'$ E. long. Bounded on the north by the independent territory of Nep\u00e1l; on the east by North Bh\u00e1galpur; on the south by Monghyr and the Ganges river; and on the west by Muzaffarpur District. Darbhanga District is 96 miles in length from south-west to north-east, and contains an area of 3665 square miles, and a population, according to the Census of 1881, of 2,633,447 souls. The administrative head-quarters and chief place of the District is Darbhanga Town.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District consists of one large alluvial plain intersected with streams, and in most parts well wooded. Mango groves and clusters of bamboo are numerous, and give a pleasing character to the scenery. But in some tracts, nothing meets the eye except an enormous tract of rice-fields. The District is divided from north to south into three separate tracts, Madhuban\u00ed in the north, T\u00e1jpur in the south, and Darbhanga proper occupying an intermediate position. The main rivers are the B\u00e1ghmah, Gandak, Little Baghmati, Kar\u00e1i, and Kamla. In the north, the fall of the ground is from north-east to south-west. In the south of the District, the fall is from north-west to south-east. The B\u00e1ghmati and Gandak rivers cross into Darbhanga from Muzaffarpur about the latitude of Darbhanga town. The lower courses of these rivers are tortuous,\nand are interlaced with each other to an extreme degree. They run together and divide so as to make a great network of deep channels, called by many local names. From north to south the ground rises gradually above flood-level, and proceeding south grows gradually less and less fertile, rice and other crops requiring plentiful moisture. The soil in the southern tracts is saliferous, yielding saltpetre and common salt in considerable quantities. The rivers flow in high raised plateaux above the surrounding country, and flood extensive areas. South of Darbhanga town the river names give but little idea of the fluvial aspects of the District. The Tiljug\u00e1, Kamla, Dhaus, B\u00e1ghmati, Little B\u00e1ghmati, and Buri Gandak, all mix their waters, not by uniting in a single stream, but by forking and joining into innumerable streams each with different local names. One stream of the Kaml\u00e1 runs into the Little B\u00e1ghmati, and afterwards into the Great B\u00e1ghmati. The names Tiljug\u00e1, Little B\u00e1ghmati, and Buri Gandak seem to have been given with rather inappropriate reference to other rivers of the same name, as if the Tiljug\u00e1 was mistaken for the lower courses of the Nep\u00e1l river Trijuga, a tributary of the Kusi river. The only broad sheet of water in the District deserving the name of a lake is the T\u00e1l Barail\u00e1, covering an area of about 20 square miles in the rainy season. Towards the north of the District and in Nep\u00e1l, some small streams are dammed up every year. The rivers Kaml\u00e1, Bal\u00e1n, and Tiljug\u00e1 are also embanked, and well irrigation is also carried on. Common long-stemmed rice grows in most parts of the District, the best-known kinds being known as esari\u00e1 and singr\u00e1, the former growing in from 14 to 18 feet, and the latter in about 5 feet of water. The jungle products of Darbhanga are necessarily few, for there are no forests or uncultivated pasture lands. The few jungle products are beeswax, lime burnt from shells, and a few drugs. The wild animals of the District comprise wolves and wild hog, of which the latter are especially common. Occasionally a stray tiger or leopard wanders down from Nep\u00e1l along a river bank. Crocodiles infest the rivers; and several kinds of reptiles are dangerous. Porpoises are also common. The small game consists of jackals, foxes, hares, wild ducks, teal, pigeon, snipe, quail, etc. The best kinds of fish are the arw\u00e1ri or mulett, and the hilsa, found chiefly in the Kar\u00e1i. The other species include the rohi, boari, n\u00fani, katk\u00e1r\u00e1, tengr\u00e1, ma, dew\u00e1, belaunch\u00e1, chilw\u00e1, p\u00fathiy\u00e1, dala, jhinga, shrimps, and cray-fish. Snakes abound, the most common being the cobra, karait, gohuman, harhara, dumih\u00e1.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of Darbhanga as at present constituted, after the formation of Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga into separate Districts in 1875, amounted in 1872 to 2,139,298; while in 1881 the population was returned at 2,633,447, showing an increase of 494,149, or 23\u00b709 per cent., in nine years, an increase, however, which\nis to a considerable extent nominal, being the result of defective enumeration in the first-named year. The results arrived at by the Census of 1882 may be briefly summarized as follows: \u2014 Area of District, 3335 square miles, with 6359 towns and villages and 377,818 houses, of which 362,576 were occupied. Total population, 2,633,447, namely, males 1,295,788, and females 1,337,659. Proportion of males in total population, 49\u00b72; average density, 789\u00b76 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 1\u00b790; persons per village, 414; villages per square mile, 1\u00b790; houses per square mile, 113\u00b725; inmates per house, 7\u00b73. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Hindus, 2,323,976; Muhammadans, 308,985; Christians, 325; and 152 'others,' nearly all Kols. Among the higher castes of Hindus are included Br\u00e1hmans, 179,263; B\u00e1bhans or military and cultivating Br\u00e1hmans, 118,556; R\u00e1jputs, 90,083; K\u00e1yasths, 45,124; and Baniy\u00e1s, 38,343. The most numerous caste in the District are the Gw\u00e1l\u00e1s, 341,112 in number; Dos\u00e1dhs, 189,534; Dh\u00e1nuks, 130,079; Mallahs, 114,891; Koer\u00eds, 129,027; Cham\u00e1rs, 88,641; Telis, 79,449; Musah\u00e1rs, 66,793; T\u00e1tw\u00e1s, 61,315; Kurmis, 67,098; Keut or Kewat, 42,067; Madaks, 38,333; Barhais, 38,343; Kandus, 33,472; N\u00e1pit, 31,958; Nuniy\u00e1s, 27,788; Sunris, 25,429; Dhob\u00eds, 21,114; Tantis, 21,584; Son\u00e1rs, 16,980; Loh\u00e1rs, 16,320; P\u00e1s\u00eds, 12,804; Kalus, 11,949; Baur\u00eds, 11,871; Kallars, 11,030; Mal\u00eds, 10,004. Total aboriginal population, including those who have embraced Hinduism, 10,986. Caste-rejecting Hindus, 5790. The 26 most numerous Hindu castes contain in all 91 per cent. of the Hindu population of the District.\n\nDistribution of the People into Town and Country.\u2014Six towns in Darbhanga District contain a population exceeding 5000 souls, namely, DARBHANGAH, population 65,955; MADHUBANI, 11,911; RUSERA, 11,578; BISHNUPUR BHERA, 5963; SULTANPUR, 5860; and MADHUPUR, 5084. Total urban population 106,351, or 4\u00b704 per cent. of the District population, leaving 2,527,096, or 95\u00b796 per cent., for the rural population. Of the 6359 villages and towns returned in 1881, 2375 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 2048 had between two hundred and five hundred inhabitants; 1092 between five hundred and a thousand; 397 between one and two thousand inhabitants; 69 between two and three thousand; 12 between three and five thousand; 3 between five and ten thousand inhabitants; 2 between ten and fifteen thousand; and 1 upwards of 50,000 inhabitants. The Census Report classifies the male population as regards occupation into the following six main classes:\u2014(1) Professional, including all civil and military officials and the learned professions, 6934; (2) domestic servants, hotel-keepers, etc., 42,447; (3) commercial, including merchants, traders, and carriers, 32,843; (4) agriculturists, including agriculturists, horticulturists, gardeners, etc., 507,425; (5)\nmanufacturing and industrial class, 64,215; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, including labourers, male children, etc., 601,673.\n\nAgriculture\u2014Land Tenures.\u2014Land is owned in estates of various sizes, from the huge estate of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Darbhangah, down to the cultivating petty mah\u00e1ls of one-acre lots in the hands of the Br\u00e1hmans, B\u00e1bhans, R\u00e1jputs, K\u00e1yasths, and Musalm\u00e1ns. Intermediate leases other than thikas or farming leases, are rare. Partition of estates has gone on rapidly of late years. The average size of the small estates is very small indeed. Excluding the Darbhangah estate, which includes nearly one-fifth of the whole District, the average size of the small estates amounts to only about 50 acres.\n\nThe principal crops are rice, linseed, indigo, mustard, tobacco, common cereals, and tuberous roots. The great rice country is in Al\u00e1pur pargan\u00e1 in the north-east of the District. The only village officials who in any way deserve the name are the patwaris, jeth r\u00e1yats or leading cultivators, and the chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs or village watchmen. The first of these officials is paid by the landlord, and the last by the village cultivator; but both are directly subordinate to the District officer. The jeth r\u00e1yat is a petty tahsild\u00e1r or rent collector, and is paid by allowances from the landlord. Rates of rent fluctuate much owing to various causes. The highest rate known is about \u00a31, 8s. an acre for the best tobacco land; the lowest rates are about 2s. 6d. per acre for poor rice land. Local custom forms a strong factor in the rent question, the higher castes paying much lower rates than those below them in the social scale. Average rents may be taken at about 7s. per acre for rice, and 10s. for land producing spring crops. Wages are generally paid in kind, ranging from 2d. a day in the country to 6d. a day in the towns. Skilled labour in the towns is paid for as highly as 1s. a day.\n\nPrincipal manufactures\u2014indigo, sugar, tobacco, saltpetre, cloth, and pottery. The indigo trade is almost entirely in the hands of European planters, and the sugar-cane is confined to natives. A tobacco factory has recently been established at P\u00fasa in T\u00e1jpur Sub-division, which turns out cigars and prepares tobacco after European and American methods. The trade of the District is considerable. In the north, merchandise is carried by means of carts and pack-bullocks from Darbhangah; much of it goes south by rail via the Tirh\u00fat State Railway; and the less perishable articles are conveyed by water. The main line of the Tirh\u00fat State Railway runs through Darbhangah District, and is continued into north-eastern Bh\u00e1galpur. The northern roads have the same general course as the rivers, namely from north-east to south-west.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The gross revenue of Darbhangah District in 1881\u201382 amounted to \u00a3167,278, of which the land revenue contributed \u00a381,926; cesses, \u00a331,733; excise, \u00a316,882; and stamps, \u00a316,259. In the same year, the gross expenditure was \u00a352,748. The strength\nof the regular police was 312 men, costing \u00a34936, besides a village watch numbering 3241, and maintained at a cost to the cultivators of \u00a311,751. The municipal police numbered 147 of all ranks, maintained at a cost of \u00a31113. The District contains one first-class and two second-class municipalities at Darbhangah, Rusera, and Madhubani, with an aggregate population of 89,444. Aggregate municipal income (1881\u201382), \u00a34736, or an average taxation on the population within municipal limits of 1s. 3d. per head. Education is not making much progress. The Darbhangah estate maintains the zillah (or District) school, and affords liberal help to others. There are the usual English schools, with a large number of p\u00e1th\u00e1s\u00e1ls, and a Sanskrit school at Madhubani.\n\nClimate.\u2014The climate is dry, generally mild, and fairly healthy. The ordinary variations of the thermometer are not excessive. Average recorded rainfall, 50 inches. Fever is constant, and causes the highest mortality. Cholera attacks the District as an epidemic every four or five years. Small-pox is not common.\n\nDarbhangah.\u2014Head-quarters Sub-division of Darbhangah District, Behar, Bengal. Area, 1222 square miles; number of towns and villages, 2260; occupied houses, 136,170. Population (1881), males 480,241, and females 489,758; total, 969,999. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 822,043, Muhammadans 147,817, and Christians 139. Average density, 793 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 1\u00b785; persons per town or village, 429; houses per square mile, 113; persons per house, 7\u00b712. The Sub-division comprises the three police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) of Darbhangah, Bahera, and Ruser\u00e1. In 1883 it contained 1 civil and 5 criminal courts, with a regular police of 255 officers and men, and a village watch or rural police of 1132 men.\n\nDarbhangah.\u2014The head-quarters station and principal town of Darbhangah District; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 10' 2\" N., long. 85\u00b0 56' 39\" E., on the left or east bank of the Little B\u00e1ghmati river. It ranks third in population and size among the towns of Behar. The Census of 1881 returned the population at 65,955, namely, males 33,633, and females 32,322. Hindus numbered 48,276; Muhammadans, 17,566; and \u2018others,\u2019 113. Area of town site, 3840 acres. The town has been constituted a first-class municipality, with an income in 1881\u201382 of \u00a33760, of which \u00a32031 was derived from taxation, being an average of 7\u00bdd. per head of the municipal population; expenditure in 1881, \u00a32514. One of the principal features in Darbhangah is the number of large tanks within the town. The three principal ones are situated in a line, with a drive passing from one to the other, their united length being 6000 feet. Darbhangah was originally a Muhammadan town. According to some authorities, the name is derived from one Darbh\u00e1ng\u00ed\nKh\u00e1n, the founder; while others say the word is a corruption of Dar-i-Bangal, or 'Door of Bengal,' alluding to the fact that it was a Muhammadan cantonment. It has even been conjectured that the large tanks above referred to, were dug to make raised grounds for the soldiers' houses. The whole country around the town becomes a swamp during the rains, being subject to inundations from the Kaml\u00e1 and Little B\u00e1ghmati; and the scarcity of high ground caused some difficulty in finding a suitable site for the new civil station in 1875. The b\u00e1z\u00e1rs are large, and markets are held daily. A handsome large market-place has recently been constructed between the hospital and the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1's garden. A considerable trade is carried on, and the communications by road are good in all directions. The T\u00edrh\u00fat State Railway connects the town with Baj\u00edtpur on the banks of the Ganges, a distance of 45 miles; and Baj\u00edtpur in its turn is connected by a steam ferry with B\u00e1rh, one of the stations on the main line of the East Indian Railway. The principal exports from the town are oil-seeds, gh\u00ed, and timber; and the imports, food-grains, salt, gunny cloth, soft goods, lime, and iron.\n\nDarbhanga has been the residence of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1s of Darbhanga since 1762. The family trace their origin to one Mahesh Th\u00e1kur, a priest under the ancient R\u00e1j\u00e1s of T\u00edrh\u00fat. After T\u00edrh\u00fat was conquered by the Muhammadans, and the race of the old princes became extinct, Mahesh Th\u00e1kur is said to have proceeded to Delhi, where he obtained the grant of the Darbhanga R\u00e1j from the Emperor Akbar. But the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1 was not duly confirmed until the time of R\u00e1ghu Singh in 1700. The residence of the family was then at Bhaw\u00e1r\u00e1, near Madhubani, where the remains of an old mud fort are still pointed out, which is said to have been built by R\u00e1ghu Singh. A temporary settlement was concluded by the British Government with M\u00e1dhu Singh, who succeeded to the R\u00e1j in 1776. A long series of disputes and misunderstandings ensued. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 refused to engage for the decennial settlement of 1790, alleging that grave injustice had been done him by the authorities. The estate was therefore leased out to two Muhammadan farmers. But in November 1791, the one resigned his share, and shortly afterwards the other was killed by a fall from his horse at Patn\u00e1, and his heirs refused to continue the lease. M\u00e1dhu again refused the settlement. The lease was then renewed to a number of small leaseholders, from 1793 up to 1800, when it expired. Negotiations were again entered into with the R\u00e1j\u00e1, but they fell through as before, and the estate was once more let in farm. At last the property was restored to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 on his consenting to pay an increase of revenue. M\u00e1dhu Singh died in 1808. His son Chhatar Singh, who lived till 1839, was the first who received the title of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1. On his death the succession was disputed, but after costly litigation, his\neldest son, R\u00fadar Singh, was declared heir to the title. R\u00fadar Singh died in 1850.\n\nHis son Maheshwar died in 1860, leaving two sons, Lakshmeswar, the present Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, and Rameswar his brother. As these were minors, the Court of Wards took charge of their possessions. Everything was in confusion; the estate was \u00a3700,000 in debt, and the revenue was only \u00a3160,000. Under the management of the Court of Wards, the property has greatly improved; the debt has been paid off, and the rental has increased by \u00a340,000. Besides this, \u00a3547,600 had been saved prior to the famine of 1874; but nearly \u00a3300,000 was then expended in charitable relief. The present Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 came of age in 1879. The estate supports a first-class dispensary at Darbhanga, another at Kharakpur, and a third at Narahiy\u00e1; an Anglo-vernacular school and 22 vernacular schools in its villages. It further contributes largely to 6 dispensaries and 27 schools. It has opened 150 miles of new road, along which about 20,000 trees have been planted. Seventeen iron and 14 masonry bridges have been erected over navigable rivers; and extensive irrigation works, at a cost of \u00a370,000, have been constructed on the Kharakpur estate in Monghyr District. The wards were educated at Benares. When the Government took charge, the family residence at Darbhanga consisted of a few low-built houses, hemmed in by hovels in the town. Many of the latter have been removed, and new buildings have been erected, surrounded by well-laid-out gardens of about 55 acres in extent. A magnificent new palace, with a menagerie and aviary, has recently been erected for the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1's residence. The estates of the R\u00e1j are situated in the Districts of Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Monghyr, Purnia, and Bhagalpur. The total rental is \u00a3238,000; the total Government revenue, \u00a340,000.\n\n**Dareh-bauk.**\u2014The name given to the northern mouth of the Salw\u00edn river from Martaban to the sea. Several centuries ago, it was the ordinary entrance for ships coming to Martaban in Tenasserim, British Burma; but for many years it has been so choked with sandbanks as to be impassable by sea-going vessels.\n\n**Dareh-by\u00fa.**\u2014Creek in Bassein District, Irawadi Division, British Burma, forming one of the entrances from the sea to the Ywe. Its mouth, in lat. 15\u00b0 51' 20\" N., and long. 90\u00b0 41' 20\" E., is so obstructed by sandbanks as scarcely to afford a passage for the smallest sea-going craft, but the rest of the river is easily navigable by river steamers.\n\n**D\u00e1rj\u00edling.**\u2014The District of D\u00e1rj\u00edling forms the most northerly portion of the R\u00e1jsh\u00e1h\u00ed Kuch Behar Division, under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal. It lies between 26\u00b0 30' 50\" and 27\u00b0 12' 45\" N. latitude, and between 88\u00b0 1' 30\" and 88\u00b0 56' 35\" E. longitude, running up between Nep\u00e1l and Bhut\u00e1n towards Independent Sikkim.\nThe British frontier is demarcated on the north from Sikkim by a series of rivers and mountain torrents, on the west from Nep\u00e1l by a lofty range of hills; along the east and south run the British Districts of Jalp\u00e1gur\u00ed and Purniah. The area was returned in 1881 at 1234 square miles; and the population, according to the Census of 1881, numbers 155,179 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at the station and sanitarium of Darjiling.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District naturally divides into two distinct tracts\u2014the ridges and deep valleys of the lower Him\u00e1layas, and the tar\u00e1i or sub-montane marshy strip immediately beneath the hills. The surface of the plains from which the Sikkim Him\u00e1layas take their rise is said to be only 300 feet above sea-level, the mountains starting abruptly from the plains in spurs of from 6000 to 10,000 feet, densely clothed with forest to their summits. The scenery is of a magnificent character. The background is formed by a jagged line of dazzling snow, connecting the two highest known peaks in the world, Everest and K\u00e1nchanjang\u00e1, each above 28,000 feet. Imposing series of parallel mountain ridges intervene, broken by almost perpendicular valleys. Up to 12,000 feet, these ridges are clad with dark-green foliage; on the high slopes the rhododendron predominates, lower down occur forests of pine and deodar, and near the plains the valuable s\u00e1l timber. To travellers fresh from the swamps of Bengal, this picturesque region would prove yet more alluring, were it not for the mists and showers which are continually closing upon the scene. European planters are now dotting the slopes of the lower ranges with trim tea-gardens. The tar\u00e1i portion of the District was formerly overgrown with malarious jungle, amid which the aboriginal tribes of Mechs, Dh\u00edm\u00e1ls, and Kochs formed clearings by fire, and reared crops of rice and cotton on a system of primitive nomadic husbandry. It has now, however, been extensively cleared for settled tillage, and for tea gardens.\n\nThe loftiest mountains are situated outside British territory; but within it on the Sing\u00e1lil\u00e1 range, marching with Nep\u00e1l, are several peaks above 10,000 feet in height. The highest peaks are\u2014Phal\u00e1lum, height 12,042 feet; Subargum, 10,430 feet; and Tanglu, 10,084 feet. Situng is another bold peak in the District, of a conical form, situated south-east of Darjiling. The station of Darjiling itself has an elevation of 7167 feet above sea-level; and on the long undulating range of Sinch\u00e1l Pah\u00e1r there were formerly barracks for a European regiment 1500 feet higher, but these have been abandoned for some years, owing to the exposed position of the place. The military lines are now at Jallapah\u00e1r, about a mile from Darjiling, and at an elevation of about 500 feet above the station. The chief rivers are the T\u00edst\u00e1, the Mahananda, and the Balasan, with their numerous affluents. The T\u00edst\u00e1, like many of the other great rivers of Northern India, rises on the farther\nside of the Him\u00e1layas, and bursts through the mountain barrier before it reaches British territory. One of its chief affluents is the Great Ranjit; and a little below the junction of the two rivers, a fine suspension bridge has been thrown across the T\u00edst\u00e1. This bridge is a most important addition to the communications of the District, as it connects the tract east of the T\u00edst\u00e1 with the main portion of the District, and keeps open throughout the year the great trade route across the Jeylep pass into Tibet. At the point where the T\u00edst\u00e1 debouches on the plains, through a gorge known as the Sivak Gol\u00e1 pass, its volume is very considerable, and it becomes at once navigable for boats of two tons burthen, although navigation is very difficult and precarious, owing to rapids, and numerous rocks and large stones in the bed of the river. Its tributaries include the R\u00e1nchu and Roli, on the left bank; and on the right, the Great Ranjit, Rangjo, R\u00e1yeng, and Sivak. The Mah\u00e1nanda, while passing through D\u00e1rj\u00edling, is a smaller stream, and altogether loses itself in the sand of the tar\u00e1i for a portion of its course. Its tributaries join it below the District boundary. The Bal\u00e1san takes its rise a few miles south-west of D\u00e1rj\u00edling, and after a southerly course enters the tar\u00e1i, when it divides into two streams, one of which, the New Bal\u00e1san, branches off and joins the Mah\u00e1nanda, while the parent stream continues its southerly course till it enters Purniah District. Two small lakes or tarns are situated amid the hills.\n\nThe mineral products of the District comprise coal, iron, copper, calcareous tufa, and slate. There are several caverns situated in the hills, the most important of which is situated near the Cutcherry (Kach\u00e1ri) hill in D\u00e1rj\u00edling station, and is superstitiously believed by the natives to extend as far as Lh\u00e1s\u00e1 in Tibet. The Ramm\u00e1n river is crossed by a natural bridge of stone, between the junction of the R\u00e1tho and Sr\u00ed with that river. With the exception of the Sivak Gol\u00e1 Pass, through which the T\u00edst\u00e1 river debouches on the plains, there are no gorges or passes in the District; but every valley and every turn of the road within the hills is highly picturesque. Several important revenue-yielding forests are strictly conserved by the Forest Department.\n\nThe principal pasture grounds are the reserved Government forests, and in the rains the higher mountains. The G\u00farungs, a Nep\u00e1l\u00ed tribe, annually depasture large flocks of sheep in this District, taking them to the heights in the rains, and in the cold weather bringing them down to the plains for sale. The Gh\u00e1li\u00e1s, another Nep\u00e1l\u00ed tribe, and the Bhuti\u00e1s and Lepch\u00e1s depasture large herds of buffaloes and cows indiscriminately. The Mechs in the plains, and the Nep\u00e1l\u00eds in the hills, collect jungle products for sale, but this is merely a subsidiary occupation to that of agriculture. Game is not abundant in the hilly tracts. Among the larger kinds are bears, leopards, and musk deer.\non the higher mountains; large deer (sambh\u00e1r) on the lower ranges; and a few elephants and tigers on the slopes above the plains. In the tar\u00e1i, tigers, rhinoceros, deer, wild hog, and a distinct species of dwarf hog are pretty numerous. A few wolves are also found. Among the smaller sorts of game, hare, jungle-fowl, peacock, partridge, snipe, woodcock, wild duck, wild geese, and green pigeon, abound in the tar\u00e1i. Jungle-fowl and pheasants are met with in the hills. Good mah\u015bir fishing is to be had in the T\u00edst\u00e1.\n\nThe History of D\u00e1rjiling presents a late chapter in the extension of British Rule. The G\u00farkha war of 1815\u201316 first brought the Company into direct relations with this region. It was then found that the aggressive G\u00farkh\u00e1s had appropriated from the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sikkim the morang or tar\u00e1i portion of the present District; and it was one of the articles of the peace of 1816, that this strip should be ceded to the British, who immediately gave it back again to the Sikkim chief. In 1835, under the Governor-Generalship of Lord William Bentinck, the nucleus of what was originally known as \u2018British Sikkim\u2019 was created by the purchase, from the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sikkim, of the sanitarium of D\u00e1rjiling, with a portion of the surrounding hills, in consideration of an allowance of \u00a3300, afterwards increased to \u00a3600 per annum. This ceded tract is described in the Deed of Grant as \u2018all the land south of the Great Ranjit river, east of the Bal\u00e1san, K\u00e1hel, and Little Ranj\u00edt rivers, and west of the Rangmi and Mah\u00e1nanda rivers,\u2019 containing about 138 square miles. D\u00e1rjiling soon became a favourite summer retreat for the officials of Lower Bengal and their families; it was also established as a sanitarium for invalided European soldiers. A good deal of land was taken up from the Government on building leases, but tea cultivation was not introduced till a much later date. In 1849, Dr. Hooker paid a visit to D\u00e1rjiling, and founded upon his experiences then gathered his well-known and most interesting Himalayan Journals (2 vols., London 1854). His visit was also productive of important political consequences. With the sanction of the British Government, and with an express permission from the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Independent Sikkim, he had crossed the frontier into that State, accompanied by Dr. Campbell, the Superintendent of D\u00e1rjiling District. There they were treacherously seized and imprisoned, by the authority of the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s Diw\u00e1n or Prime Minister. A military expedition was despatched to rescue the prisoners, and avenge the insult. The yearly allowance granted to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was stopped. The Sikkim morang or tar\u00e1i, at the foot of the hills, was annexed; and a considerable addition was also made to the British territory that lay among the mountains. In all, about 640 square miles of land were acquired on this occasion. Finally, in 1864, the District received a further augmentation by the cession of a hilly tract east of the T\u00edst\u00e1, which had become British\nterritory as the result of the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n campaign of that year. This tract covers an area of 486 square miles, and is known as the Sub-division of Kalimpong or D\u00e1lingkot. The relations between the British Government and the State of Sikkim, which are conducted through the Deputy Commissioner of D\u00e1rjiling, are now of a most friendly character. The allowance to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 has not only been restored, but has been raised to \u00a31200 a year; and his Darb\u00e1r lends all the assistance in its power to the development of the through trade with Tibet. D\u00e1rjiling has obtained a place in the history of oriental scholarship, as the residence for years of Mr. Brian Houghton Hodgson, of the Bengal Civil Service. Mr. Hodgson, after distinguished services as Resident in Nep\u00e1l, retired from active employment, and devoted himself to the study of the Sub-Him\u00e1layan races. He fixed his headquarters at D\u00e1rjiling; and from that District issued his remarkable series of essays and researches, which still form the basis of any systematic study of the non-Aryan peoples of India.\n\nThe popularity of D\u00e1rjiling as a sanitarium has been fully maintained in recent years, notwithstanding the rival attractions of Simla and other hill stations in Northern India. The opening of the Northern Bengal State Railway to the foot of the hills, and of the D\u00e1rjiling and Himalayan Railway up to D\u00e1rjiling itself, has rendered the station easily accessible from the plains and Calcutta, from which it can be reached in 24 hours. The popularity of the place has rapidly increased since the railway extension; and new private buildings and municipal improvements have been rapidly pushed forward during the past few years. (See D\u00e1rjiling Town.) The enterprise of European capital, in the form of tea cultivation and manufacture, has opened a new era of prosperity. The oldest tea-garden now existing only dates back to 1856. In 1882\u201383, 165 gardens were open, with an estimated production of more than 8 million pounds of tea. The cinchona tree has been successfully introduced, so that D\u00e1rjiling now aids in saving from fevers even those who are compelled to remain on the plains.\n\nPopulation.\u2014In 1872, the population of D\u00e1rjiling District, according to the Census Report of that year, was 94,712, spread over an area of 1234 square miles. The Census returns for 1881 disclosed a total population of 155,179, living on the same area, showing an increase of 60,467 persons, or 63\u00b784 per cent., in the nine years. This remarkable increase, however, is to a great extent only nominal, owing to defective enumeration in the tardi and eastern T\u00edst\u00e1 tracts in 1872. Nevertheless, the Census officer reports that at least one-half of the reported increase is real, being due to the rapid development of the tea industry, and the extraordinary demand for labour on the railway and other public works. \u2018To meet this rapidly-increasing demand, the local supply of labour was quite unequal; and the result has been an unexampled\nimmigration. So that in Darjiling District more than half the population (52.44 per cent.) were born outside its limits. Of this number, 55,000 are hillmen from beyond the British frontier, chiefly from Nep\u00e1l; nearly 5000 came from the neighbouring District of Jalpaiguri, and more than 10,000 from Purniah. The remainder are composed of representatives from almost every Province of India. The general results arrived at by the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 1234 square miles; number of towns and villages, 943; number of houses, 29,904, of which 29,028 are occupied and 876 unoccupied. The population numbered 155,179, namely, males 88,948, and females 66,231; proportion of males in total population, 57.45 per cent. Average density, 125.7 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, .76; persons per village, 163; houses per square mile, 24.2; persons per house, 5.3. Classified according to religious belief, the population was returned as follows:\u2014Hindus, 126,717; Sikhs, 3; Muhammadans, 8204; Christians, 842; Buddhists, 18,775; Br\u00e1hmos, 14; aboriginal religions, 624. The great bulk of the population consists of aboriginal or semi-aboriginal tribes, among whom the Nep\u00e1l\u00eds are the most numerous. The Lepchas, who are considered the primitive inhabitants of Sikkim, are included among the Buddhists, but are few in number, and the race is said to be declining. (See separate article, LEPCHA, in its alphabetical order.) The Nep\u00e1l\u00eds, including the Murmis, are divided among no less than 42 sub-tribes, and are returned among the Hindus. The R\u00e1jbans\u00ed Kochs number 30,801. The Bhuti\u00e1s are not returned separately in the Census, but are included among the Buddhists. Of the Hindus proper, the two superior castes of Br\u00e1hman (numbering, including B\u00e1bhans, 10,739) and R\u00e1jput (6352) are the most numerously represented, very few of the other recognised Hindu castes exceeding 1000 in number. The population of Darjiling increased by more than one-half between 1872 and 1881, and is still growing at a rapid rate. The Nep\u00e1l\u00eds are coming across the frontier in large numbers, and are eagerly welcomed by the tea-planters as their most valuable labourers; while Beng\u00e1l\u00eds from the plains are gradually extending over the tar\u00e1i. The Br\u00e1hma Sam\u00e1j is represented by a few Beng\u00e1l\u00ed Government clerks at Darjiling station, who have no regular place of meeting.\n\nThe population may be divided into those connected with the tea industry, and the aboriginal agriculturists. There are no towns with the exception of Darjiling station, 4033, which in February 1881 had a population of 7018, which may be assumed as the permanent population; but to this number must be added the temporary visitors during the summer months. The only other place of any note is Karsi\u00e1ng (Kurseong), situated in the lower hills, 20 miles to the south, with a population in 1881 of 4033. Of the 943 villages, 769 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 114 between two hundred and five hundred;\nbetween five hundred and a thousand; 11 between one and two thousand; and 3 upwards of two thousand.\n\n**Agriculture.**\u2014Rice constitutes the one food-crop grown in the tar\u00e1i portion of the District; but among the hills, Indian corn, millets (mar\u00fad, etc.), wheat, potatoes, and cardamoms are also grown, wherever practicable. Subordinate crops in the plains are cotton, jute, pulses, oil-seeds, and sugar-cane. As usual throughout Bengal, the rice crop is divided into two harvests, the \u00e1man or haimantik, reaped in winter, and the \u00e1us or bhada\u00ed, reaped in the month of Bh\u00e1dra (August to September). Rice cultivation is rapidly extending through the tar\u00e1i, although somewhat retarded by the requirements of the Forest Department. Beng\u00e1l\u00ed and Nep\u00e1l\u00ed cultivators use the plough, and plough cultivation is also extending among the aboriginal tribes, especially in the tract to the east of the T\u00edst\u00e1. The nomadic method of agriculture known as j\u00edm, which consists in burning down a fresh patch of jungle land each successive year, is decreasing. The d\u00e1o or hill knife is used for all rustic operations. Manure is not commonly applied anywhere; but throughout the tar\u00e1i, and in the hills wherever natural facilities are afforded, irrigation is industriously practised by the cultivators of all classes. In the tar\u00e1i and hills, the land measurements locally known are the h\u00e1l and p\u00e1t\u00ed, the former being the quantity of land which a plough and pair of oxen can turn up in one day, and the latter the weight of seed required to sow a given area. The seed standard is a most variable one; but for general purposes one p\u00e1t\u00ed may be taken as the equivalent of 8 lbs. weight of seed, and twelve p\u00e1t\u00eds as the measure of seed required for one acre. According to the other standard, an acre is represented by a quarter h\u00e1l, or a plough and pair of oxen for four acres. These local measurements are now being superseded by the English standard acre, by which the recent land settlement with the native cultivators was made, and according to which, no doubt, the hill-man will be able in the course of time to calculate the area of his holding. The average yield of Indian corn on the best lands in the hills is $7\\frac{1}{3}$ cwts. or 10 maunds per acre, and on inferior lands about $3\\frac{1}{2}$ cwts. In the tar\u00e1i, the yield of rice per acre varies from $8\\frac{3}{4}$ cwts. or 12 maunds to $3\\frac{1}{2}$ cwts. per acre. A revised land settlement was concluded in 1880 with the jotd\u00e1rs for a period of ten years, at rates varying from 3s. to 4s. per acre. In the K\u00e1l\u00edmpong Sub-division in the hills east of the T\u00edst\u00e1, most of the land under native cultivation has been surveyed and settled on ten years' leases with the occupiers, dating from 1882, the assessment being at the rate of 1s. per acre for the best and 6d. per acre for inferior lands, liable to enhancement at the expiry of five years to 1s. 6d. per acre for the best and 9d. per acre for inferior land. This money assessment is in substitution for the poll-tax formerly paid by the cultivators. About thirty thousand acres have already been\nsettled in this manner; but in the more sparsely-cultivated portions of the Sub-division, the poll-tax is still levied at the rate of 5s. for each adult male, and 4s. for each adult female. In the Government estates (Kh\u00e1s mah\u00e1ls) west of the T\u00edst\u00e1, a house-tax of 6s. per house is levied; but these estates will shortly be assessed with the cultivators on joint r\u00e1y\u00e1tv\u00e1ri leases, at money rates approved by the Government, viz. 1s. 6d., 1s. 1\u00bdd., and 9d. per acre, according to the quality of the soil. The cultivated area of these mah\u00e1ls is between 20,000 and 30,000 acres. The other tenures in the District, which include the tea leases, are (1) freehold and (2) leasehold grants. The former consist of commuted leases; the latter are for terms varying from ten to thirty years. All tea leases now falling in will, under recent orders of Government, be renewed for a term of twenty years at an all-round rate of one rupee or 2s. an acre. Besides the foregoing there are building leases for lands in D\u00e1rjiling station and Karsiang. The D\u00e1rjiling municipality receives the ground rents of sites within municipal limits.\n\nThe average price of rice in the tar\u00e1i during the five years ending 1881\u201382 was 8s. a cwt., the current rate in the last year being 6s. 8d. in the tar\u00e1i and 8s. per cwt. in the hills. The average price of Indian corn in the hills for the five years was 6s. 1\u00bdd. per cwt., the current rate in 1881\u201382 being 5s. 1\u00bdd. per cwt. These are the two main food-crops of the District. The fall in prices, while due to some extent to good harvests, is in a great measure attributable to the improved means of communication afforded by the D\u00e1rjiling and Him\u00e1layan Railway, and the T\u00edst\u00e1 bridge. On the other hand, wages have risen. This is mainly due to the large demand for skilled labour for the great public works in progress\u2014the railway, T\u00edst\u00e1 bridge, hospital, etc. The following rates prevail:\u2014Goldsmiths, \u00a33 per month; Chinese carpenters, \u00a36 per month; native carpenters, from 1s. 3d. to 1s. 6d. per diem; masons, \u00a31, 8s. per month; day-labourers, 6d. to 9d. per diem; tea-garden coolies, 6s. to 10s. per month; grass-cutters, 14s. per month; domestic servants, from 18s. to \u00a31, 12s. per month.\n\nTea.\u2014The staple industry of D\u00e1rjiling is the cultivation and manufacture of tea. It is conducted almost entirely by means of English capital and under skilled European supervision. The discovery of tea in India dates from 1826, when a Mr. Bruce, who commanded a flotilla of gunboats in Upper Assam in the first Burmese war, found the plant growing wild, and brought down with him some plants and seeds. It was not till some time after tea cultivation had established itself in the Assam Valley that any attempt was made to introduce it into Bengal proper. The first regular tea-garden in D\u00e1rjiling was opened in 1856; and after the natural mistakes of the first few years, the business has continued to prosper with accelerating prosperity. In 1866 there\nwere 39 gardens established, with an area under cultivation of 10,392 acres, yielding an out-turn of 433,715 lbs. of tea. By 1875 the number of gardens had increased to 121, with an area under cultivation of 22,162 acres, and an out-turn of 4,600,758 lbs. of tea. In 1882\u201383 the number of tea-gardens numbered 165, covering a total planting area of 44,482 acres, of which 26,716 acres were under mature and 5854 under immature plant, while 12,282 acres taken up for planting had not been put under seed. The approximate yield of the season 1882\u201383 was 8,080,293 lbs. A favourable season and good markets combined to render the years 1881\u201382 and 1882\u201383 very encouraging ones for the planters, and to re-establish many gardens to which the disastrous year of 1880\u201381 had nearly proved fatal. Improved machinery and processes of manufacture have been introduced into many of the gardens. Plucking is more carefully attended to than formerly, and greater regard is paid to the withering and manipulation of the leaf. Steam machinery is used now on many gardens, while in others water-power is employed. The principal blights which tea-planters have to contend with are the red spider, green fly, and mosquito blight. This last-named insect causes most apprehension in the lower ranges of the hills. The plague is said to be increasing, and to be more serious than the red spider by attacking the bud, and not allowing the plant even to mature. The red spider proves a terrible scourge in some gardens, and baffles the efforts of the most energetic planter to get rid of. A white grub turning into a brown beetle attacks the roots of the tea plant, and wherever it makes its appearance is exceedingly destructive.\n\nCoolie labour is on the whole plentiful, and the light nature of the work attracts a number of immigrants from the surrounding hill States, especially Nep\u00e1l. The Census of 1881 shows that during the previous decade there has been a great increase of settled immigration of Nep\u00e1lis with their wives and families to the D\u00e1rjiling tea-gardens. Women and children take a large part in the labour on a garden, in plucking and sorting. The D\u00e1rjiling and Him\u00e1layan Railway has greatly increased the facilities for the transport of tea to Calcutta.\n\nCinchona, etc.\u2014The cultivation of cinchona was commenced by Government in 1862, and the experiment has now established its success. In 1875, a sum of \u00a35217 was expended on the plantations; the yield of dry bark was 211,931 lbs., which produced 1989 lbs. of quinine valued at \u00a33182. This was the first year when the young trees came into bearing. The total number of trees in the plantation on the 31st March 1882, was 4,762,200 cinchonas of all sorts. The crop of bark amounted to 341,570 lbs. Of cinchona febrifuge, 10,878 lbs. were issued during the year; 4650 lbs. were sold to the general public, and the remainder was supplied to Government hospitals and dispensaries. There was a net profit on the year\u2019s working of \u00a313,000, equal\nto a dividend of 13 per cent. on the capital expended. The saving effected by Government during the year by the substitution of cinchona febrifuge for quinine was \u00a335,000. The success of the Government plantation has induced private cultivation. One company has taken up a large tract of ground east of the T\u00edst\u00e1 for this purpose, and another is rearing seedlings on its tea-gardens. The experimental cultivation of ipecacuanha has also been attempted, but without much success as yet. In 1876, a public botanical garden was established at Rang\u00e1r\u00fan; but this has since been abandoned, and a new garden has been established in the station.\n\nD\u00e1rj\u00edling is not liable to either of the calamities of flood or drought. In the event of local scarcity from any cause, the hill people could always save themselves from starvation by migrating to other localities; but in the tar\u00e1i, previous to the construction of the railway, the inhabitants were in some danger of isolation. If the price of rice were to rise rapidly in January, after the gathering of the \u00e1man or low-land rice crop, that should be regarded as a sign of approaching scarcity.\n\nManufactures, Trade, etc.\u2014Coarse cotton cloth is woven by all the aboriginal tribes, especially by the Lepch\u00e1s. The favourite colours are white, with blue and red borders. These Lepch\u00e1 cloths are in some request among the residents and visitors to the station. The price of the better sorts varies from \u00a31 to \u00a31, 8s. each.\n\nThe local trade of D\u00e1rj\u00edling is entirely confined to the wants of European inhabitants, and of the tea plantations. A considerable trade is carried on by the hillmen with residents and visitors in China cups, turquoise, coral, and amber ornaments, jade and agate cups and beads, praying wheels, bells, amulets, and other curiosities illustrative of Buddhist monastic life; kukris, Bhuti\u00e1, and Lepch\u00e1 knives, etc. The D\u00e1rj\u00edling shopkeepers trade mostly in European piece-goods, stores, glass, hardware and crockery. Much attention has recently been directed to the development of through trade with Tibet via Sikkim, and with Nep\u00e1l. In 1881, the import of untaxed salt from trans-Him\u00e1layan sources into D\u00e1rj\u00edling amounted to 1658 cwts. The chief articles of import from Nep\u00e1l are sheep, goats, cattle, poultry, hides, food-grains, and country cloth; the exports consisting principally of European piece-goods, gram, salt, vegetables, betel-nut, sugar, and tobacco. The trade with Sikkim is of the same character as that with Nep\u00e1l, but is more extensive. In 1882\u201383 the total value of the Sikkim trade through D\u00e1rj\u00edling was \u00a331,644, namely, imports \u00a320,014, and exports \u00a311,629. The Bh\u00fat\u00e1n trade mainly passes through Jalp\u00e1gur\u00ed District. The D\u00e1rj\u00edling and Him\u00e1layan Railway is gradually absorbing all the District traffic, to the exclusion of bullock carts and pack ponies.\n\nMines.\u2014The mineral wealth of D\u00e1rj\u00edling was carefully investigated in 1873 by Mr. Mallet of the Geological Survey. He was of opinion that\nthe coal measures, which are easily exposed, but are of a peculiar friable character, might possibly be used remuneratively on the Northern Bengal Railway. Their chemical analysis is good, especially for the formation of artificial fuel, but there would be no little difficulty in delivering the coal on the plains. Both iron and copper are worked in several places by the Nep\u00e1l\u00eds, but the character and accessibility of the mines is not such as to attract European capital. Lime can be procured in abundance from dolomite, tertiary limestone, and calcareous tufa. The last-mentioned is now largely burned in kilns.\n\nThe Northern Bengal State Railway stops in the plains at Siliguri, about 8 miles short of the hills; but railway communication is carried on to D\u00e1rj\u00edling by the D\u00e1rj\u00edling and Him\u00e1layan Railway, 40 miles in length. In 1882, the total length of roads within the District was returned at 617 miles. An excellent iron suspension bridge has recently been constructed across the T\u00edst\u00e1 on the highway to Tibet.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1880\u201381, the total revenue of D\u00e1rj\u00edling District amounted to \u00a318,814, towards which the land-tax contributed \u00a311,967. The expenditure was \u00a314,151. In the following year, 1881\u201382, the total revenue had increased to \u00a330,003, and the land-tax to \u00a313,843, while the civil expenditure was \u00a317,667. Under the head of land revenue is included the house and bullock tax paid in a certain portion of the hills, and also the poll-tax levied in the still unsettled tract east of the T\u00edst\u00e1. In 1882 there were 3 covenanted officers stationed in the District, and 6 magisterial and 4 civil and revenue courts open, presided over by 6 stipendiary magistrates and 5 civil judges. In 1881, the regular police force consisted of 223 men of all ranks, maintained at a total cost of \u00a34093, and a municipal police of 35 officers and men, costing \u00a3496. These figures give 1 policeman to 5 square miles of area, or to every 601 persons in the population; the cost averaged \u00a33, 14s. 5d. per square mile, and 7\u00bdd. per head of population. In the same year, the number of persons in D\u00e1rj\u00edling District convicted of any offence, great or small, was 1492, being 1 person to every 104 of the population. By far the greater proportion of the convictions were for petty offences. The District contains one jail, which is necessarily a very expensive one on account of the small number of prisoners confined. In 1881, the daily average number of prisoners was 88\u00b78, of whom 2\u00b777 were females; the labouring convicts averaged 81\u00b76. These figures show 1 prisoner to every 1747 of the District population.\n\nEducation has considerably advanced in recent years, despite the difficulties caused by an aboriginal population speaking various strange tongues, and dwelling in widely-scattered huts among the mountains. Up to 1860 there was only 1 school in the District\u2014the Government English School, attended by 33 pupils. By 1872, the number of schools had risen to 29 with 723 pupils; the total expenditure was \u00a31735,\ntowards which Government contributed \u00a3667. In 1875, the schools further increased to 46 and the pupils to 994. The Census of 1881 returned 1610 boys and 179 girls under instruction, and 5686 males and 269 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. The principal educational institution is the St. Paul's School, established at Calcutta in 1845 for the sons of Europeans and East Indians, and removed to Darjiling in 1864. In 1881 it was attended by 134 pupils, and received a Government grant of \u00a3505. Other schools for European and Eurasian education are\u2014a Government boarding-school at Karsiang, attended in 1881 by 28 boys and 13 girls; a Protestant girls' school, with 85 pupils; St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Seminary, with 51 pupils; and the Darjiling Convent School, with 36 boys and 131 girls. A Government boarding-school for aboriginal tribes has also been established in Darjiling, and is attended by Lepchas from Sikkim, and Bhutias. All the pupils learn English and Tibetan. Its purpose is to train up a body of explorers, surveyors, and interpreters; and it has been fairly successful in this respect. The Church of Scotland has established a number of primary schools, chiefly for the children of Nepali coolies working in the tea-gardens. An English newspaper, the Darjiling News, is printed at the station.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Darjiling is marked by excessive humidity. According to Dr. Hooker, 'Sikkim is the dampest region in the whole Himalayas. . . . Throughout the greater part of the year, the prevailing wind is from the south-east, and comes laden with moisture from the Bay of Bengal.' The few hours between sunrise and 9 A.M. form the only period of the day entirely free from clouds, mist, or rain. The average annual rainfall is returned at 120 inches. The rainfall in 1881 was 9 inches below the average. The average mean atmospheric pressure over a period of five years is 23.320. During 1881, the maximum temperature recorded was 76.2\u00b0 F. in May and July; the minimum by night was 36.5\u00b0 in December.\n\nThe District is not unhealthy, the hills being almost free from endemic disease except goitre. In the tarai and the lower valleys malarious fevers occur. Cholera rarely if ever visits the station, and small-pox is disappearing before the introduction of vaccination. During 1881, the charitable dispensaries at Darjiling station, Karsiang and Kalimpong, were attended by 183 in-door and 9356 out-door patients. Before the close of that year a second dispensary was opened at Karsiang.\n\n[For further information regarding Darjiling District, see the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. x.

Area, 792 square miles; villages, 122; occupied houses, 11,801. Population (1881) 65,001, namely, males 36,683, and females 28,318. Hindus numbered 48,172; Muhammadans, 961; Christians, 629; Buddhists, 15,225; and Br\u00e1hmos, 14. Proportion of males, 56\u00b743 per cent.; average density of population, 82 persons per square mile; number of houses per square mile, 15; persons per house, 5\u00b75. D\u00e1rj\u00edling Sub-division consists of the police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) of D\u00e1rj\u00edling and Kalimpong. It contained in 1883, 3 civil and 3 criminal courts, and a District police numbering 179 officers and men. The chaukid\u00e1ri or village watch system is not in force in the District.\n\nD\u00e1rj\u00edling.\u2014Town and administrative head-quarters of D\u00e1rj\u00edling District, Bengal, situated in the lower Him\u00e1layas. Lat. 27\u00b0 2' 48\" N., long. 88\u00b0 18' 36\" E. The station occupies a narrow ridge, which divides into two spurs, descending steeply to the bed of the Great Ranjit, up whose course the eye is carried to the base of the great snowy mountains. The ridge is very narrow at the top. The valleys on either side are at least 6000 feet deep, forest clad to the bottom, with very few level spots, but no absolute precipice. From the flanks of these valleys innumerable little spurs project, occupied by native clearings. The ridge varies in height from 6500 to 7500 feet above sea-level. D\u00e1rj\u00edling was acquired by the English Government in 1835 as a sanitarium, a tract of country 138 square miles in extent being ceded by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sikkim, in return for an allowance of \u00a3300 per annum, afterwards raised to \u00a3600. The station rapidly increased, and soon became a favourite summer retreat for the officials of Lower Bengal and their families. The Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal ordinarily spends several months of every year in D\u00e1rj\u00edling, which is now brought within 24 hours\u2019 journey of Calcutta, by the Northern Bengal State Railway, and its continuation, the D\u00e1rj\u00edling and Him\u00e1layan Railway. D\u00e1rj\u00edling is rapidly increasing in favour as a summer resort for visitors and for invalids. A fine building, the Eden Sanitarium, was opened in 1883 for the reception of sick and convalescent, with accommodation for 52 patients. Private building enterprise has increased considerably in the last few years, especially on the property of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kuch Behar. A line of pipes has been laid from the Sench\u00e1l Springs which furnishes the town with an ample supply of good water. New secretariat and other public buildings are in contemplation. Besides the residence of the Lieutenant-Governor and the public offices, the other principal buildings are the Episcopalian\nChurch, Wesleyan Chapel, Roman Catholic Convent, St. Paul's School, Club, etc. Two gardens, Lloyd's Botanical Garden and the People's Park, are open to the public. A military depot, consisting of barracks for about 150 men, stands on the hill some 500 feet above the station, and about a mile distant, which is occupied by European invalids during the hot months. The situation, although very bleak, is healthy. The population of the town fluctuates according to the season, but the number was returned by the Census of February 1881 at 7018, namely, Hindus, 4592; Muhammadans, 614; 'others,' 1812; area of station, 3420 acres. This may be called the normal or resident population, but during the hot weather months, from April to October, it is much increased by the influx of visitors from the plains. The area of the municipality formerly coincided with that of the tract originally ceded by the Sikkim R\u00e1j\u00e1, and comprised about 138 square miles. It is now, however, restricted to the station itself. Municipal income, 1881-82, \u00a35964; expenditure, \u00a35796.\n\nDarkuti.\u2014One of the petty Punjab Hill States under the Government of the Punjab. The R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Darkoti, R\u00e1m Singh, is a R\u00e1jput. When the G\u00farkhas were driven out of the hills, the British Government confirmed the chief in possession of this State, which, owing to its smallness, pays no tribute. The area is 5 square miles. Lat. (centre) 31\u00b0 7' 0\" N., long. 77\u00b0 38' 30\" E. Population (1881) 590. Revenue, \u00a360.\n\nDarm\u00e1n.\u2014Town in Shakargarh tahsil, Gurd\u00e1spur District, Punjab. Population (1881) 1618, namely, 1242 Hindus and 376 Muhammadans; number of houses, 251. A third-class municipality, with a revenue in 1882-83 of \u00a353; expenditure, \u00a356; average incidence of taxation, 8d. per head of population. The town is the seat of a colony of Pah\u00e1ri Mah\u00e1jans.\n\nDaro.\u2014Village in the Sh\u00e1hbandar Sub-division, Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Population (1881) about 1000, mainly agricultural. The Piny\u00e1ri river is here crossed by a masonry bridge of six spans, each 25 feet wide. Police station; dharms\u00e1la, or rest-house; cattle pound. Has road communication with Mirpur Batora, 8 miles distant, with Belo, and with Bano.\n\nDarod.\u2014Petty State in Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r Division, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r Province, Bombay Presidency. It consists of 1 village, with 2 independent tribute-payers. The revenue is estimated at \u00a3118; tribute of \u00a336, 12s. is paid to the British Government, and of \u00a35 to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1gahr.\n\nDarrang (Durrung).\u2014District forming a portion of the upper valley of the Brahmaputra, in the Province of Assam. It lies between 26\u00b0 12' 30\" and 27\u00b0 2' 30\" N. lat., and between 91\u00b0 45' and 93\u00b0 50' E. long. Bounded on the north by the Bhuti\u00e1, Aka, and Daphla Hills; on the east by the Mar\u00e1marnai river, separating it from Lakhimpur\nDistrict; on the south by the Brahmaputra; and on the west by K\u00e1mr\u00fap District. Area, 3418.26 square miles. Population (1881) 273,333 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Tezpur, situated near the confluence of the Bhairav\u00ed with the Brahmaputra.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Darrang consists of a narrow strip of land, shut in between the lower ranges of the Him\u00e1layas and the Brahmaputra. Its total length is 126 miles from east to west, with an average width of about 25 miles. Numerous rivers and streams cross it, flowing southwards from the hills; and the general level is broken by a range of low hills, from 200 to 500 feet high, which sweep outwards in a crescent shape from the Bhairav\u00ed to the Brahmaputra, covering an area of about 25 square miles. The population of the District is sparse, and the area under cultivation is still very limited. Extensive tracts are overgrown with dense reed and cane jungle, characteristic of the Brahmaputra valley, amid which occur rare patches of rice cultivation. Virgin forests cover a large portion of the region which lies under the northern hills. Forest reserves, from which timber-cutting and jhum cultivation are carefully excluded, have recently been declared by the Government over an aggregate area of 272 square miles. In 1880-81, the total amount of revenue realized from the direct sale of timber, and from royalties on the sale of timber, amounted to \u00a32454. Wild animals of all kinds abound, including elephants, rhinoceroses, buffaloes, bison, and tigers. In 1879, it was found necessary to revise the rates paid for the destruction of wild animals. The following is the present (1883) sanctioned scale for Darrang District:\u2014Tigers, \u00a32; leopards, 10s.; bears, \u00a31; hyenas, 5s. During 1880-81, \u00a3152 was paid on this account. Wild elephants occasionally do considerable damage to the crops. The right of capturing these animals has recently been placed under restrictions, and was leased out in 1882-83 for \u00a3256. Gold-washing is carried on in several of the hill streams, especially in the Bhairav\u00ed. Limestone of an inferior quality is found in the west of the District; and travertine, containing as much as 90 per cent. of lime, has been discovered just beyond the British frontier. Coal, also, is known to exist outside the northern boundary of the District, but not, it is believed, in valuable quantities or of good quality.\n\nThe great river of Darrang is the Brahmaputra, which forms the continuous southern boundary, and is navigable for steamers all the year through. Among its tributaries, the five following are navigable for large native boats:\u2014The Bhairav\u00ed, Ghil\u00e1d\u00e1ri, Dhaneswari (Ji\u00e1 Dhansiri), Nonai, and Bar N\u00e1di. These all rise in the mountains beyond the frontier, and flow nearly due south into the Brahmaputra. There are about 26 minor streams, which only become practicable for\nsmall boats during the rains. Some of the rivers, immediately after leaving the hills, sink beneath the sandy soil, and reappear several miles lower down. There are no lakes or artificial watercourses in the District. Two embankments have been made for purposes of cultivation, to restrain the flood-waters of the Brahmaputra and Bar Nadi; and the old roads of the Aham R\u00e1j\u00e1s, known as R\u00e1j Al\u00eds, usually run along raised earthen banks.\n\nHistory.\u2014Darrang District possesses no history apart from Assam generally. Besides sharing in all the vicissitudes of the Province, it has experienced special troubles of its own, owing to the proximity of the wild Bhuti\u00e1 and Daphla tribes. Archaeological evidence and local tradition attest the existence of Hindu civilisation high up the Brahmaputra valley in very early times. The hills encircling the town of Tezpur are still covered with ruins, hidden among the jungle, which reveal the traces of temples and palaces such as could only have been erected by a powerful dynasty. The building materials used were gigantic blocks of granite, which appear to have been supplied by the immediate neighbourhood. These blocks were carefully hewn to form altars, columns, and porticoes, and many of them are profusely ornamented with carvings in basso-relievo, among which the emblems of Siva are conspicuous. It is conjectured, from the appearance of the ruins, that these buildings must have been overthrown by the hand of some invader; and local tradition points to K\u00e1l\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r, the General of Sulaim\u00e1n, King of Bengal, as the author of the sacrilege. Another legend is preserved in the Prem S\u00e1g\u00e1r, which relates the battles between B\u00e1n R\u00e1j\u00e1 and the god Krishna. B\u00e1n R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s name is associated with many of the ruins near Tezpur. He was a demi-god, sixth in descent from Brahma, and was the first to introduce the worship of Siva into Assam. After the downfall of the early Hindu kingdom, however that may have been brought about, Darrang, like the rest of Assam, relapsed into primitive barbarism. The Ahams, a wild tribe, of Shan origin, from the Burmese Hills, first entered the valley of the Brahmaputra about the 13th century, and very gradually advanced downwards. The Ahams organized their conquered territory with minute precision, and held their own until the advent of the British. Though they have given their name to the Province, it is surprising to find how small are their present numbers.\n\nBut the Ahams, though undisputed masters of the valley, never extended their sway far from the river banks. In the present administration of Darrang District is still to be traced a curious relic of fluctuating jurisdiction. A tract of country extending along the foot of the northern hill ranges is said to have been ceded by the Aham R\u00e1j\u00e1 to the Bhuti\u00e1s for a period of eight months in each year, in order to afford them the means of cultivating rice and other necessaries, which\nthey could not raise on their own bleak mountains. In consideration of this grant, the Bhuti\u00e1s were to pay an annual tribute to the Aham R\u00e1j\u00e1 of articles produced and manufactured in the mountains; while the latter was to retain his jurisdiction over the tract for the remaining four months of the year, from about the middle of June to the middle of October. This arrangement was continued during the few first years after the British conquest of Assam. But in 1840, the claims of the Bhuti\u00e1 chiefs were commuted for a money payment of \u00a3500 a year, which was calculated as the equivalent of the average emoluments they derived from the land. The revenue at present derived by the British Government from the 'debateable' tract amounts to \u00a35183.\n\nThe Bhuti\u00e1s here referred to are commonly known as the Towang Bhuti\u00e1s, and are independent of the State of Bh\u00fat\u00e1n, being directly subject to the Government of Lh\u00e1s\u00e1. They carry on a considerable trade direct with Tibet, and have uniformly manifested a quiet and friendly attitude. Next to the Bhuti\u00e1s on the east, come the Akas or Hrusso, a small tribe, who used formerly to commit frequent raids on British territory. They receive pos\u00e1 or black-mail to the amount of \u00a370 a year. Even so recently as 1883, the Akas, in asserting a claim to a tract of land which had been declared a forest reserve, raided upon British territory, and carried away the native forest officers as hostages into their hills. A military expedition was necessary to punish the offending tribe, and to effect the release of the captives. See article Akas, vol. I. pp. 135\u20136. Farther east, again, are the Daphlas, whose native mountains extend along the neighbouring District of Lakhimpur. The Daphlas are a tribe of whom little was known prior to the recent frontier expedition, which was caused by their wanton outrages on British subjects. In the year 1872, the village of Amtol\u00e1, occupied by Daphla settlers, was attacked by a strong party of hill Daphlas, and 44 persons were carried off to the mountains. It was ascertained that this raid had no political significance. The object was merely to seize a number of slaves as an equivalent for certain of their own people who had died of disease, said to have been introduced from the plains. The Daphla Hills were forthwith blockaded by a strong force of police, stationed in blockhouses at all the passes. The police were subsequently replaced by military; but this method of pressure was found ineffectual. Accordingly, in the cold season of 1874\u201375, an armed force entered the hills, and, without encountering any opposition, achieved the release of all the surviving captives.\n\nPopulation.\u2014In 1840, the population of Darrang was estimated at about 80,000. The first regular Census was taken in 1872, when the population was ascertained to be 236,009. At the last enumeration in 1881, Darrang contained a total population of 273,333, being an increase of 37,324 in the nine years since 1872. The results arrived at\nby the Census of 1881 may be briefly summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 3418 square miles; number of villages, 1672; number of houses, 49,172. Total population, 273,333, namely, 142,418 males and 130,915 females; average density, 79\u00b79 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 0\u00b749; persons per village, 163; houses per square mile, 14\u00b74; persons per occupied house, 5\u00b75. Classified according to religion, there were:\u2014Hindus, 251,838; Muhammadans, 14,677; Christians, 371; Buddhists, 723; Jains, 27; Br\u00e1hmos, 18; hill tribes professing aboriginal religions, 4852. In Darrang, as in the rest of the upper valley of the Brahmaputra, a great proportion of the population are of aboriginal descent, numbering 143,467, although they have now nearly all embraced Hinduism. Of the aboriginal tribes, the most numerous are the K\u00e1ch\u00e1r\u00eds, numbering 72,200, with their cognate tribe of R\u00e1bh\u00e1s, 15,090. The Kochs number 42,061. The other tribes consist of Ahams, the former rulers of the Province, 3312 in number, with the cognate Chutiy\u00e1s, 1362; Bhuti\u00e1s, 723; Daphlas, 339; G\u00e1ros, 84; Madah\u00eds, 2140; Mik\u00edrs, 1315; Mir\u00eds, 3113; Sant\u00e1ls, immigrants from Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, employed on the tea-gardens, 1728. Of the foregoing tribes, all, with the exception of the Bhuti\u00e1s, who are Buddhists, and the Daphlas, Mik\u00edrs, and Mir\u00eds, who practise different forms of aboriginal demon-worship, are returned in the Census Report as Hindus by religion. Of Hindus proper Br\u00e1hmans number 8929; Ganaks, an inferior caste of mendicant Br\u00e1hmans who practise astrology, number 8798; Kshatris, 724; and K\u00e1yasths, 2464. Of the lower castes, by far the most numerous is the Kalit\u00e1, 24,460, the ancient priesthood of Assam, who are now admitted to Hinduism as pure S\u00fadras; Kat\u00e1n\u00eds or Jugi, silk-weavers, 16,609; Keut or Kewat, fishermen, 13,970; Dom, fishermen, a degraded caste in Bengal, but with high assertions to ceremonial purity in Assam, 9418; Bori\u00e1, 3002; K\u00farm\u00eds, 2086. The Muhammadans are almost without exception of the Sunni sect. They are for the most part comparatively well off, but the religion of Isl\u00e1m has ceased to make further progress in the District by conversion. Of the Christian population, 235 are natives. The Church of England numbers 287 adherents; 33 are Presbyterians, 25 Baptists, and 21 Roman Catholics. The native Christians belong for the most part to the K\u00e1ch\u00e1ri tribe, among whom is established a Mission of the Church of England. A masonry church has been built, and an annual allowance of \u00a3150 is made by Government towards the maintenance of the mission schools. As a class, the native Christian community may be said to be tolerably well off. The Br\u00e1hma Sam\u00e1j has a meeting-house at Tezpur town, established in 1872; but the members consist entirely of immigrant Bengalis, mostly engaged in Government service. Jain traders are settled at Tezpur town and at Nalb\u00e1ri.\nAs throughout the rest of Assam, the entire population is absolutely rural. Out of 1672 villages in the District, only 51 contain upwards of a thousand inhabitants, while 1299 have less than two hundred, 316 from two to five hundred, and 54 from five hundred to a thousand inhabitants. The largest place in the District is Tezpur town, with only 2910 inhabitants; next comes the Sub-divisional station of Mangaldai. Other places of some importance as trading centres, or as containing the residences of wealthy men, are Biswanath (Bishnath), Hawala Mohanpur, Nalbari, and Kuruagao. Generally speaking, the people are well off. Their wants are few, and the land is held on easy terms, subject to an annual re-settlement. Numerous ruins are scattered over the hills in the neighbourhood of Tezpur.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The one staple harvest of the District is rice, grown in two crops. The sali crop, corresponding to the aman of Bengal, sown on low lands and reaped in the winter, furnishes much the largest proportion of the food-supply. The aus crop is sown broadcast on high lands, and reaped in the early summer, when the field is again available for a second or cold weather crop of oil-seeds or pulses. Agricultural statistics, which are more trustworthy in Assam than in Bengal, show that the area under rice greatly increased between 1850 and 1866, but has since diminished. In 1880\u201381, the total cultivated area was returned at 221,864 acres, thus divided:\u2014Rice, 260,671 acres; mustard, 7565; sugar-cane, 1912; kalai, 6453; tea, 15,041; and other crops, 31,034 acres. Of the total area returned as under cultivation, 10,193 acres produced more than one crop during the year. The aggregate out-turn of rice, oil-seeds, and pulses, is estimated at nearly 3 million cwts., with a value of \u00a3400,000. The land is divided into three classes, paying rent to Government at the following rates, which have remained fixed since 1868:\u2014Basti, or homestead land, on which vegetables, etc. are grown, 6s. an acre; rupit, or moist lands, suited for sali rice, 3s. 9d. an acre; pharinghati, for aus rice and second crops, 3s. an acre. The out-turn from an acre, whether of rupit or pharinghati land, is estimated at 16\u00bd cwts., valued at about \u00a32, 5s. The peasantry are fairly well off, and generally free from debt; their present comfortable condition affords a striking contrast to the miseries from which they were relieved by the expulsion of the Burmese in 1825. At the present day, a laborious and skilful husbandman is able to cultivate 4 acres of sali rice, 1\u00bc acre of mustard seed, a similar area under pulses, and about one-third of an acre each of sugar-cane and vegetables. Seven acres of land would make a comfortable, fair-sized holding for a cultivator; a small one would consist of three acres of moist and about half an acre of dry land. An ordinary pair of bullocks can cultivate from 5\u00bd to 6 acres. All the cultivators hold their land direct from Government; their tenure is permanent and\ntransferable, and subject to a moderate rent, which is liable to enhancement from time to time. There are a few exceptions in favour of l\u0101khirdj lands, or grants held either rent-free or at a very low rental. Manure is nowhere commonly used. Irrigation is only practised in the tract under the hills inhabited by the K\u00e1ch\u00e1ris, who are very industrious in leading the streams through artificial channels over their rice-fields, and frequently combine with one another to effect this operation on a large scale. Rupit lands are cultivated continuously with the s\u0101l\u012b rice crop; but pharinghati lands, which generally bear two crops in the year, are occasionally allowed to lie fallow. There is abundance of cultivable waste in all parts of the District; but the heavy grass jungle and forest with which it is now overgrown would be very expensive to clear. There are no present indications among the people towards the growth of a distinct class of day-labourers, neither possessing nor renting land. Indeed, the tendency appears to be in the opposite direction. Those who have no land hire themselves out by the month as labourers on the tea-gardens, and soon save enough money to buy a pair of bullocks and rent a small patch of land.\n\nThe rate of wages and the price of food-grains have both risen about three-fold within the last twenty years. In 1880-81, an ordinary labourer received from 6d. to 8d. a day. Agricultural labourers are paid in kind, and frequently live in the houses of their employers. But labour of all kinds is extremely scarce. The inhabitants have a passion for cultivating their own plots of land, and a short period of work on a tea-garden furnishes them with the capital necessary to purchase a pair of bullocks and the few implements required. In 1881, common rice was selling at 6s. 10d. a cwt.; fine rice, which is usually imported from Bengal, at 8s. 11d. a cwt. The highest prices known to have been reached in Darrang were in 1857-58, when common rice fetched more than \u00a31 a cwt.\n\nDarrang is not exposed to either of the natural calamities of flood or drought, and blight has never been known to have seriously injured the crops. In the event of excessive inundations, compensation would be found in the increased fertility of the uplands; and similarly, if the rainfall were ever to prove deficient, the drying up of the swamps would offer new fields to cultivation. The single famine recorded in Darrang was caused, not by the failure of the crops, but by the invasion of the Burmese in the early years of the present century.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The only indigenous manufacture in Darrang is that of silk-weaving. The silk is of two kinds, known as eri\u00e1 and mug\u00e1. The former is the produce of the worm Phal\u00e6na cynthia, which is reared almost entirely in-doors, and fed on the leaves of the Ricinus communis or castor-oil plant. The mug\u00e1 worm, or Phal\u00e6na saturnia, is\nfed on certain forest trees in the open air, but also requires careful tending. The entire manufacture is carried on without capital or division of labour. Each individual spins, weaves, and dyes his own web; yet some of the fabrics attain a high standard of excellence, and are bought up for export by the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri traders. There are minor industries in certain villages of brass-work and pottery. The braziers, called Mari\u00e1s, form a community by themselves.\n\nThe cultivation and manufacture of tea is chiefly carried on by means of European capital and under European supervision. In 1881, there were altogether 122 tea-gardens in Darrang District, managed by 14 European assistants and 138 native officials. The total area under mature plant was 12,123 acres, the out-turn amounting to 4,079,123 lbs. The number of imported labourers employed was 14,007, of whom 3726 were under contract under the Emigration Act.\n\nThe external commerce of the District is conducted by means of the Brahmaputra, which is navigable by steamers all the year through. The local trade is in the hands of M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri immigrants, chiefly from Bik\u00e1ner and Jodhpur States. The principal exports are tea, oil-seeds, silk cloth, and miscellaneous forest produce brought in by the hill tribes. The imports consist of cotton and woollen cloth, salt, fine rice, dried fruits, spices, etc. The permanent centres of trade are Tezpur, Mangaldai, and Biswanath. Weekly markets are held in the neighbourhood of the tea-gardens. Annual trading fairs have been instituted in certain villages at the foot of the northern hills, in order to encourage intercourse with the Bhuti\u00e1s. The most important of these is at Udalguri, on the north-west frontier. The principal articles brought for sale by the Bhuti\u00e1s are\u2014ponies, blankets, salt, wax, gold, lac, and musk; in return for which they carry away rice, cotton and silk cloth of native manufacture, and brass-ware. This gathering lasts for three or four weeks. In 1881\u201382, the total value of the articles interchanged was valued at \u00a331,325, the balance of trade being greatly in favour of the Bhuti\u00e1s.\n\nApart from the main highway of the Brahmaputra, means of communication are somewhat defective. Second in importance is the Assam Northern Trunk Road, which runs through the entire length of the District for a distance of 143 miles. There are several minor roads crossing north and south, and an elephant path, or h\u00e1thi pot\u00ed, skirts continuously the base of the Bhut\u00e1n Hills. The rivers are generally crossed by ferries. The total length of roads in the District is returned at 571 miles, and of navigable rivers at 230 miles.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1870\u201371, the net revenue of Darrang District amounted to \u00a366,654, towards which the land contributed \u00a336,503, and opium, \u00a319,158; the expenditure was \u00a326,461, of which \u00a39983 was for the commission of the mauz\u00e1dd\u00e1rs or fiscal officials. In 1881\u201382,\nthe net revenue had increased to \u00a388,871, of which the land revenue amounted to \u00a345,951, and the excise to \u00a331,823. The civil expenditure in the same year was \u00a325,225. The land revenue has nearly trebled within the past thirty years, having amounted in 1850 to only \u00a315,668. In 1880-81, there were 2 European covenanted officers stationed in the District, and 10 magisterial and 4 civil and revenue courts open. For police purposes the District is divided into 6 than\u00e1s or police circles. In 1881, the regular police force numbered 290 officers and men, maintained at a total cost of \u00a35237. These figures show 1 policeman to every 11\u00b78 square miles of the area, or to every 942 of the population, and an average cost of \u00a31, 10s. 8d. per square mile, or 4\u00bdd. per head of population. There is no municipal police in Darrang, and the chaukid\u00e1rs or village watch of Bengal are not found anywhere in Assam proper. The District contains 1 jail at Tezpur Station and 1 Sub-divisional lock-up at Mangaldai. In 1881, the daily average number of prisoners was 203\u00b730, of whom 6\u00b745 were females. These figures show 1 person in jail to every 1346 of the population. The total cost amounted to \u00a31348, or \u00a36, 12s. 3d. per prisoner.\n\nEducation does not make such progress in Darrang as in the wealthy Districts of Bengal, but yet some improvement has been exhibited in recent years. In 1856, the total number of schools was 20, attended by 613 pupils. The figures of 1870 show a positive decrease; but by 1880-81, when Sir G. Campbell\u2019s reforms had come into operation, the inspected schools had increased to 97, and the pupils to 2655. These figures show 1 school to every 35 square miles, and 7 pupils to every thousand of the population. The Government high school at Tezpur teaches up to the matriculation standard of the Calcutta University. The Census of 1881 returned 1484 boys and 15 girls under instruction, and 2795 adult males and 88 adult females able to read and write, but not under instruction. The normal school at Tezpur is under the management of the English Church Mission.\n\nThe District is divided into 2 administrative Sub-divisions, and into 7 than\u00e1s or police circles, as under\u2014(1) Tezpur Sub-division, containing the police circles of Tezpur, Khari\u00e1p\u00e1ra, Chati\u00e1, and Gohpur; and (2) Mangaldai, containing the police circles of Mangaldai, Kal\u00e1ig\u00e1on, and Chatg\u00e1n\u00ed. There are 9 mah\u00e1ls or fiscal divisions, corresponding to the pargan\u00e1s of Bengal, containing an aggregate of 111 mauz\u00e1s or revenue estates. There is no municipality in the District.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Darrang does not differ from that common to the whole of the Assam valley. The north-east monsoon, which marks the opening of the cold season, sets in about the beginning of November, and lasts till the end of April. It is frequently interrupted in March by heavy winds from the south-west, but the south-west monsoon proper lasts from May to October. The annual\nrainfall for the five years ending 1880-81 averaged 77.07 inches at Tezpur and 66.92 inches at Mangaldai.\n\nThe prevalent diseases are intermittent fevers\u2014generally quotidian or irregular\u2014dysentery and diarrhoea, goitre, epilepsy. Dyspepsia is said to be common among the numerous class of opium-eaters. Small-pox breaks out almost every year, in consequence of the practice of inoculation. In recent years, cholera has repeatedly manifested itself with extreme epidemic violence, and with most fatal results. In 1874, out of a total of 8061 deaths reported throughout the District, as many as 2997 were assigned to cholera, showing a mortality from this cause alone of 12.6 per thousand. The total mortality for that year was at the rate of 34.1 per thousand, being the highest death-rate recorded in any of the Assam Districts, and more than double the rate in Darrang for the previous year. In 1882, the number of registered deaths was 7840, or at the rate of 28.68 per thousand of the population. A contagious disorder is common among the cattle of Darrang, which is thought to have been introduced by imported buffaloes from Bengal. The chief symptoms are loss of appetite, excessive thirst, high temperature of the body, and watery evacuation. The proportion of deaths among the animals attacked is very high. Two charitable dispensaries afford medical relief to the poor.

The coal-field is situated on both sides of the Someswari river; it is about ten miles in length from west to east, and about six miles in breadth from north to south. Within these limits the coal measures occupy an area of about fifty square miles. The coal in the eastern half is not of a good quality, but that in the western half, covering an area of twenty square miles, gives at least one seam of coal of good quality of a thickness sufficient to be worked profitably. The amount of coal to be obtained from the seam is estimated at 76,000,000 tons.\n\n**Darsenda.**\u2014Tahsil and pargan\u00e1 in Band\u00e1 District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Kumharsin.\n\n**Darsi.**\u2014Zamind\u00e1ri t\u00e1luk, or Sub-division, Nellore District, Madras Presidency.

Daryabad is said to be gradually increasing its area, owing to the recession of the Gogra towards the east. The present course of that river is now about 8 miles east of its ancient bank, the intervening ground being comparatively low. Area, 214 square miles, of which 137 are cultivated. Of the 241 villages which comprise the pargan\u00e1, 110 are held under talukdari and 131 under zamindari tenure, the principal landholders being Surajbans Kshatriyas. Cultivated area in acres\u2014rice, 26,023; wheat, 23,801; jo\u00e1r, 1097; jo\u00e1r and bajra, 500; sugar-cane, 2063; barley, 5479; gram, 5000; poppy, 802; vegetables, 215; oil-seeds, 400; miscellaneous, 18,434.

The founder of the creed, Baba Jagjuvan Das, was born here, and the present religious head of the sect, Baba Jaskaran Das, is his descendant in the twelfth generation.\nDary\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Town in Bara Banki District, Oudh; situated on the high road from Lucknow to Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d), about 24 miles east of Naw\u00e1bganj. Lat. 26\u00b0 53' N., long. 81\u00b0 36' E. Founded about 450 years ago by a deputy (subahd\u00e1r) of Sult\u00e1n Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Shark\u00ed.

The original name of the place under the Hindus was Deogarh (Deogiri). It succeeded Bij\u00e1pur as the capital of the Yadava kingdom. Little is known of its history before its capture by the\nMuhammadans under Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn of the Khilji dynasty, who at the head of a body of 8000 horse appeared before the town in A.D. 1294. After sacking the town, he laid siege to the fort, which after a period of three weeks was, owing to the unexpected nature of the attempt, and to the failure of provisions, surrendered by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1mchandra of the Yadava dynasty, which had established itself at Deogiri about the close of the 12th century on the downfall of the Kalachur\u00eds, the successors of the Western Chalukyas. Ferishta relates that the terms of peace exacted by Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn were as follows:\u2014That R\u00e1mchandra should pay six hundred maunds (a maund is equal to 80 lbs.) of gold, seven maunds of pearls, two maunds of jewels, consisting of rubies, diamonds, jaspers, and emeralds; one thousand maunds of silver, five thousand pieces of silk and other articles; that he should hand over Ellichpur, then the capital of Ber\u00e1r, with its adjacent districts; and that he should pay a yearly tribute. The capture of the fortress is noteworthy, as this event was the first appearance of the Muhammadans in the Deccan. The new conquest was neither lasting nor untroubled.\n\nIn 1306, R\u00e1mchandra rebelled, and M\u00e1lik Naib K\u00e1fur, a Muhammadan general, was despatched to Deogiri. R\u00e1mchandra was taken prisoner and carried to Delhi, where the Sult\u00e1n treated him with clemency and even honour, and from whence in the end he was sent back to his dominions. R\u00e1mchandra was succeeded by his son Sankara, but as Sankara proved hostile, K\u00e1fur once more appeared, took the fortress, and put the king to death. When K\u00e1fur retired, he left strong garrisons in Deogiri and other Deccan points of vantage; but immediately after his withdrawal, Harpala, who had married a daughter of R\u00e1mchandra, rose in revolt. A Muhammadan army again appeared; Harpala was defeated and captured; and after being flayed alive by order of Mub\u00e1rik Kh\u00e1n, the new Sult\u00e1n, his skin was hung over the gate of Deogiri. A succession of favourites of the Delhi Sult\u00e1n now ruled in Deogiri; until in 1325, Muhammad Tughlak Sh\u00e1h, the son of Ghiy\u00e1s-ud-d\u00edn, ascended the throne. In 1338, Muhammad Tughlak conceived the idea of making Deogiri the capital of the Muhammadan Empire; and having re-christened the fort Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d, or \u2018The Fortunate City,\u2019 issued stringent orders for the evacuation of Delhi and for the immediate removal of the population to Deogiri. The distance from Delhi to Deogiri is 800 miles. Delhi, called by an annalist of that time the \u2018Envy of the World,\u2019 became deserted at the order of the cruel and eccentric Emperor. The story runs that a paralytic and a blind man alone were found in the silent streets when the evacuation was over. The paralytic was blown from the mouth of a culverin; the blind man was dragged from Delhi to Deogiri, a march of forty days; but \u2018the poor wretch fell in pieces during the journey, and only one leg reached Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2019 Deogiri, however, rose into\nimportance. Ibn Batuta, a native of Tangiers, visited Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d when Tughlak had his court there, and compares it for size and splendour to the former Delhi. Not once but twice did Deogiri gain at the expense of Delhi, and wholesale migrations were ruthlessly commanded and as ruthlessly enforced. On the second occasion, the ravages of a famine were added to the disasters of a long and painful journey. In a few years, the dynasty of Tughlak was followed, in this region, by the Bahmani kings of Gulbarga and chiefs of Bider. The Bahmanis held Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d until they became extinct in 1526. The Bahmanis were succeeded by the Nizam Shahi kings of Ahmednagar, who held the fortress until their kingdom fell beneath the sway of the Mughal. After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the fortress of Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d, with other Mughal possessions in the Deccan, passed into the hands of Asaph Jah, the founder of the Nizam\u2019s dynasty, in whose family they have remained ever since. Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d has not been garrisoned as a fortress for many years. At present there is a force of about 100 military police stationed there. The gardens for which the place was once famous have nearly all disappeared.\n\n**Daulat Kh\u00e1n.**\u2014Village and formerly the head-quarters of Dakshin Sh\u00e1hb\u00e1zpur Sub-division, B\u00e1karganj District, Bengal.

Principal autumn crops\u2014cotton, rice, millet, urd, m\u00fag, vetches, etc.; spring crops\u2014wheat, barley, gram, arhar, oil-seeds, sugar-cane. Population (1881) 33,467, namely, 16,397 males and 17,070 females. Of the 104 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, 26 are held under t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r\u00ed, 34 under\nzam\u012bnd\u0101r\u012b, and 44 under pattid\u0101r\u012b tenures. Six bi-weekly markets are held for the sale of country produce.\n\n**Dausa.**\u2014Town in Jaipur (Jeypore) State, R\u0101jput\u0101na, Central India. Population (1881) 7384, namely, Hindus, 6057; Muhammadans, 1139; and unspecified, 188. Station on the R\u0101jput\u0101na State Railway, distant about 38 miles east from Jaipur. Dausa was once the capital of the State before Amber was wrested from the Minas. It stands on the slope of a large isolated flat hill nearly four miles in circumference, fortified with a loopholed wall with bastions of considerable strength. The town contains numerous Hindu temples and ancient edifices fast falling to decay. At the close of the Mutiny, Tantia Topi, the famous rebel leader, was caught between two columns of British troops in the neighbourhood of Dausa, when a battle was fought under its walls. Staging bungalow, dispensary, and post-office. The Agra and Ajmere trunk roads intersect at Dausa.\n\n**Davangere.**\u2014T\u0101luk in Shimoga District, Mysore State, Southern India. Area (including Harihar t\u0101luk, incorporated in 1875), 662 square miles; land revenue (1882), exclusive of water-rates, \u00a315,591. The t\u0101luk is watered by the Tungabhadra, which runs along the western boundary. The surface is a wide, level, and dreary plain. Black soil prevails in the west, and stony or gravelly soil in the east. Chief crops, jola, cotton, and ragi. Rice and sugar-cane are grown to a small extent. The dynasty of the Kadambas were probably the earliest Hindu occupants of the country. The Ch\u0101lukya and Ball\u0101la dynasties followed, the seat of government being at Huchangi-Durga. The Yadavas of Deogiri were in possession when that dynasty declined on the advent of the Muhammadans in the 13th century. After falling to the Vijayanagar Empire and the Bednur chiefs, Davangere t\u0101luk eventually became part of Haidar Ali\u2019s possessions. Noted for the manufacture of finely-woven kamblis or woollen blankets, which have been known to sell for \u00a320 or \u00a330 a-piece. The t\u0101luk contains 1 criminal court; police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 10; regular police, 76 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u0101rs), 294.\n\n**Davangere.**\u2014Town in Shimoga District, Mysore State, Southern India. Lat. 14\u00b0 28' N., and long. 75\u00b0 59' E.; 40 miles north-west of Chitaldr\u016bg. Population (1881) 6362, namely, 5584 Hindus, 763 Muhammadans, and 15 Christians. Originally an obscure village, Davangere became a centre of trade under the patronage of Haidar Ali, who gave it as a j\u00e1gir to a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chief. The merchants are mostly Sivaite Bhaktas or Ling\u00e1yats. Their most valuable business is the carrying trade between W\u00e4ll\u00e1j\u00e1-pet in North Arcot and the neighbourhood of S\u00e1gar and Nagar. Exports\u2014areca-nut, pepper, and kamblis or country blankets.\n\n**D\u00e1vasi-betta.**\u2014Peak on the Br\u00e1hmagiri Hills, Mysore.\nDavid, Fort St. (Native name, Thevanapatnam or Tegnapatam).\u2014A ruined fort in South Arcot District, Madras Presidency; situated in lat. $11^\\circ 44' 20''$ N., and long. $79^\\circ 49' 30''$ E., 100 miles south of Madras, and $1\\frac{1}{2}$ miles north of Cuddalore, of which it may be called a suburb. It was purchased from the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in 1690, and was included in the kaul of that year, by which Cuddalore was granted to the Company. All the land round the fort, to the distance of a 'randome shott' fired on every side, was included in the purchase. It was christened 'Fort St. David,' perhaps by its Welsh Governor M. E. Yale; and from 1746 to 1752 it replaced Fort St. George as the chief settlement on the Coromandel coast. (See Cuddalore.) Upon the capitulation of Madras to the French under Bourdonnais in 1746, the Company's agent at Fort St. David assumed the general administration of British affairs in the south of India, and successfully resisted an attack by Dupleix. Clive was appointed Governor in 1756. In 1758, the French, under M. Lally, captured and dismantled the fort while Clive was serving in Bengal, but sufficiently restored it in 1783 to withstand an attack by General Stuart. The ruined houses on the ramparts are still interesting, and some parts of the fort are in good preservation. Subterranean passages appear to have run completely round under the glacis, thus forming a safe means of communication for the garrison; while, at short intervals, other galleries striking off at right angles, and terminating in powder chambers, served as mines. At the south-east corner, the gallery ran down to the edge of the sea, while on the other three sides the fort was protected by the river Penn\u00e1r and two canals. The ruins form a recognised landmark for mariners.\n\nDaw\u00e1.\u2014Zamind\u00e1ri or estate in Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Central Provinces, lying to the north of the Great Eastern Road, and about 30 miles northeast of Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1. Population (1881) 4997, chiefly Gonds and Halb\u00e1s, dwelling in 12 villages, on an area of 26 square miles, of which 7 square miles are cultivated. Daw\u00e1 and Kor Seon\u00ed, the only large villages, both possess indigenous schools, and the latter contains a strong colony of Kor\u00eds. The chief is a Halb\u00e1. Daw\u00e1 village is situated in lat. $21^\\circ 11'$ N., and long. $80^\\circ 13'$ E.\n\nDawer.\u2014Town in Merw\u00e1ra, Ajmere-Merw\u00e1ra Division, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Lat. $25^\\circ 26'$ N., long. $73^\\circ 51'$ E. Situated at the extreme south of Merw\u00e1ra, at the head of the Dawer pass into Jodhpur. Police station, school, and post-office.\n\nDawna.\u2014Range of mountains forming the eastern boundary of Amherst District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. This chain starts from the M\u00faleh-yit Hill (5500 feet high) in the main range, in lat. $16^\\circ 5' 45''$ N., long. $98^\\circ 42' 3''$ E., and extends northwest for 200 miles, dividing the waters of the Haung-tharaw and Hlaing-bhweh rivers from those of the Thaung-yin. The general\nappearance of the range is that of a wooded plateau of laterite cut up by drainage into ridges. At places the underlying rocks project into the bed of the Thaung-yin, indicating volcanic agency. Large areas on the Dawna Hills are covered with evergreen forests, containing many varieties of valuable timber.\n\n**Day\u00e1** ('The River of Mercy').\u2014The western distributary of the waters of the Kovakhai river, in Orissa, through Pur\u00ed District into the Chilk\u00e1 Lake. Subject to disastrous floods, which in the rainy season burst the banks, and sometimes desolate hundreds of square miles. In the dry weather, a series of long shallow pools, amid expanses of sand. Fall per mile at section half-way between Cuttack city and the sea, 1\u00b77 feet; mean depth of section, 16\u00b778 feet; estimated discharge, 33,100 cubic feet per second. Thirty-six breaches were made in its embankment in 1866.\n\n**Dayang or Doyong.**\u2014River in Assam, forming in part the eastern boundary between the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills District and the unexplored country occupied by the independent N\u00e1g\u00e1s. It rises in the prolongation of the B\u00e1rel range which runs through the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills, and divides that District from Manipur State, its source being between the lofty peaks called Khurrho and Kopamedza. It ultimately falls into the Dhaneswari (Dhansiri) river, a short distance above Gol\u00e1gh\u00e1t, in lat. 26\u00b0 26' N., and long. 93\u00b0 58' E. Navigable by small boats during the rainy season as high as its junction with the Dihinggj\u00e1n.\n\n**Debar.**\u2014Lake in Udaipur (Oodeypore) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, Central India. Situated about 30 miles south-east of Udaipur town, the centre lying in lat. 24\u00b0 18' N., and long. 74\u00b0 4' E. It is formed by a dam entirely made of massive stone, built across a perennial stream, where it issues through a gap in the surrounding hills. This dyke is called Jai Samand, after R\u00e1n\u00e1 Jai Singh, by whom it was constructed A.D. 1681. The length of Lake Debar from east to west is 8 or 10 miles, and its average breadth about a mile, with a circumference of about 30 miles; elevation above sea-level, 960 feet. Its northern shore is dotted with picturesque fishing hamlets, and its surface with small wooded islands, adding greatly to the beauty of perhaps one of the largest artificial sheets of water in the world.\n\n**Debh\u00e1t\u00e1.**\u2014Village and municipality in Maih\u00e1t\u00ed pargan\u00e1, Khuln\u00e1 District, Bengal; situated on the river Jam\u00fana. Lat. 22\u00b0 33' 30\" N., long. 89\u00b0 0' 15\" E. Population (1881) 5514, namely, Hindus, 4002; and Muhammadans, 1512; area of town site, 2400 acres. Municipal income (1881\u201382), \u00a3336; average incidence of taxation, 1s. id. per head of municipal population. Large trade in lime produced from burnt shells.\n\n**Debi P\u00e1tan.**\u2014Village with temples and large religious fair, in Gonda District, Oudh. Lat. 27\u00b0 32' 8\" N., long. 82\u00b0 26' 30\" E. Stated to be\nprobably one of the oldest seats of the Sivaite cultus in Northern India. The earliest legend connects it with R\u00e1j\u00e1 Karna, son of Kunti, the mother of the three elder P\u00e1ndavas by the Sun-god, and hero of the impenetrable cuirass, who, abandoned in his cradle on the Ganges, was adopted by Adirath, the childless King of Anga. Brought up at the court of Hastin\u00e1pur, Karna was refused by Dron\u00e1 the arms of Brahma, which, however, he eventually obtained from Parasur\u00e1ma by faithful service at his retreat on the Mahendra mountain. In after life, he attended Duryodhana to the Swayamvara, described in the Mah\u00e1-bh\u00e1rata, and, having taken a prominent part in the great war, was finally granted the city of Malini by Jar\u00e1sindhu, the Sivaite King of Magadha, over which he reigned as a tributary to Duryodhana. The ruins of an ancient fort, once occupying the site of the present temple, and an adjoining tank, are popularly ascribed to this legendary monarch. In the middle of the 2nd century A.D., Vikram\u00e1ditya, the Br\u00e1hminist king, who restored the sacred city of Ajodhy\u00e1 on the decline of Buddhism, erected a temple on the site of the ancient fort. This in its turn fell into ruins; and another was built on the same spot at the end of the 14th or beginning of the 15th century, by Ratan N\u00e1th, the third in spiritual descent from Gorakh N\u00e1th, the deified saint whose worship is spread all over the Nep\u00e1l valley. As far as can be judged from the remains, this temple must have been of considerable size, adorned by profuse sculptures, and full of stone images of Siva and Devi in their various forms. For some centuries, the temple was a great resort for pilgrims, chiefly from Gorakhpur and Nep\u00e1l, until its importance attracted the attention of the iconoclastic Aurangzeb, one of whose officers slew the priests, destroyed the temple and images, and defiled the holy places. The temple was soon afterwards restored, but on a smaller scale, and still exists. A large religious-trading fair, lasting for about ten days, and attended by about 100,000 persons, is held here each year. The principal articles of commerce are\u2014hill ponies, cloth, timber, mats, gh\u00ed, iron, cinnamon, etc. During the fair, large numbers of buffaloes, goats, and pigs are daily sacrificed at the temple.\n\nDeccan (Dakshin, 'The South').\u2014The Deccan, in its local acceptation, signifies only the elevated tract situated between the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) and Kistna (Krishna) rivers, but it is generally and properly understood to include the whole country south of the Vindhya mountains, which separate it from Hindust\u00e1n proper. In its larger sense, therefore, it comprehends the valley of the Narbad\u00e1, and all southward\u2014the belt of lowland that fringes the coast, as well as the triangular table-land, the sides of which are formed by the Eastern and Western Gh\u00e1ts, and the base of the S\u00e1tpura range of the sub-Vindhyas. On the western side, this table-land descends seaward by a succession of terraces, the Gh\u00e1ts throughout averaging 4000 feet in height above the\nsea, and terminating abruptly near Cape Comorin, the extreme southern point of the peninsula, at an elevation of 2000 feet. From here, following the coast-line, the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts commence in a series of detached groups, which, uniting in about lat. $11^\\circ 40'$ N., run northward along the Coromandel coast, with an average elevation of 1500 feet; and join the main ridge, which crosses the peninsula in lat. $13^\\circ 20'$ N. They terminate in nearly the same latitude as their western counterpart. The Vindhyan range, running across the north of the Deccan, joins the northern extremities of the two Gh\u00e1ts, and thus completes the peninsular triangle. The eastern side of the enclosed table-land being much lower than the western, all the principal rivers of the Deccan\u2014the God\u00e1vari, Kistna, Penn\u00e1r (Ponnaiyar), and K\u00e1veri (Cauvery)\u2014rising in the Western Gh\u00e1ts flow eastward, and escape by openings in the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts into the Bay of Bengal. Between the Gh\u00e1ts and the sea on either side, the land differs in being, on the east, composed in part of alluvial deposits brought down from the mountains, and sloping gently; while on the west, the incline is abrupt, and the coast strip is broken by irregular spurs from the Gh\u00e1ts, which at places descend into the sea in steep cliffs.\n\nGeologically, the Deccan table-land presents a vast surface of hypogene schists, penetrated and broken up by extraordinary outbursts of plutonic and trappean rock; varied on the Western Gh\u00e1ts by laterite; on the eastern by laterite, sandstones and limestones; and in the valley of the K\u00e1veri by granite. To the north-west, this schistoid formation disappears, emerging occasionally from under one of the largest sheets of trap in the world. Underlying this surface throughout, is a granite floor; while in places overlying it are, in the following order, gneiss, mica and hornblende schists, clay-slate, marble\u2014all destitute of organic remains\u2014together with fossiliferous limestones, varieties of clay and sand rocks. Through all these aqueous deposits, the volcanic trap thrusts itself. Two rocks, characteristic of the Deccan, are found capping the trap\u2014viz. laterite, an iron-clay, and regar known in its disintegrated state as 'black cotton-soil.' The latter is remarkable for its retentiveness of moisture, and for its fertility.\n\nLittle is known of the history of the Deccan before the close of the 13th century. Hindu legends tell of its invasion by R\u00e1ma, and arch\u00e6ological remains bear witness to a series of early dynasties, of which the Dravida, Chola, and Andhra are the best known. Continuous history commences with the Muhammadan invasion of 1294\u20131300 A.D., when Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, the Khilji Emperor of Delhi, conquered 'Mah\u00e1r\u00e1shtr\u00e1,' 'Tel\u00edng\u00e1na,' and 'Karn\u00e1ta.' In 1338, the reduction of the Deccan was completed by Muhammad Tughlak; but a few years later, a general revolt resulted in the establishment of the Muhammadan B\u00e1hmani dynasty and the retrogression of Delhi supremacy beyond the Narbad\u00e1.\nThe B\u00e1hmani dynasty subverted the Hindu kingdom of Teling\u00e1na (1565), and (at the battle of T\u00e1l\u00edkot in the same year) the great Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagar or 'Karn\u00e1ta.' A few years later, it itself began to disintegrate, and was broken up into the five Muhammadan kingdoms of Bij\u00e1pur, Ahmadnagar, Golconda, B\u00edd\u00e1r, and Ber\u00e1r. The two last became extinct before 1630; the other three were successively restored to the Delhi Empire by the victories of Sh\u00e1h Jeh\u00e1n and his son Aurangzeb. The Deccan was thus for a second time brought under the Delhi rule, but not for long. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in 1706 obtained the right of levying tribute over Southern India. Their leader, concentrating his strength in what is now the Bombay Presidency, founded the Sat\u00e1ra dynasty, which afterwards resigned all real power to the Peshw\u00e1 of Poona. Another usurper, rallying the southern Muhammadans round him, established the Niz\u00e1m\u00e1t\u00ed of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d). The remainder of the imperial possessions in the Deccan was divided among minor chiefs, who acknowledged the supremacy of the Peshw\u00e1 or the Niz\u00e1m, according as they were north or south of the Tungabhadra respectively. Mysore, generally tributary to both, became eventually the prize of Haidar Al\u00ed; while in the extreme south, the Travancore State enjoyed, by its isolated position, uninterrupted independence. Such was the position of affairs early in the 18th century. Meanwhile, Portugal, Holland, France, and Great Britain had effected settlements on the coast; but the two former on so small a scale that in the wars of the Deccan they took no important part. The French and English, however, espoused opposite sides; and the struggle eventually resulted in establishing the supremacy of the latter. The Deccan is to-day represented by the British Presidency of Madras and part of Bombay, together with Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d), Mysore, Travancore, and other Native States.\n\n**Ded\u00e1n.**\u2014Petty State in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency. It consists of 11 villages, with 2 independent tribute-payers. The revenue in 1881 was estimated at \u00a33000, of which \u00a3295, 12s. is payable as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda.

Population (1881) about 2000; average annual value of trade for the five years ending 1871-72, \u00a314,108, viz. exports, \u00a35135; and imports, \u00a38973. Mention is made of Deg\u00e1m as a seaport of Broach in the Ain-i-Akbari.\n\nDegh.\u2014River in Jammu (Jummoo) State, and in Si\u00e1lkot, Lahore, and Montgomery Districts, Punjab. Formed by the union of two streams at Parmandal, in Jammu, both of which take their rise in the outer Himalayan ranges. Enters British territory near the village of Lehri-Kal\u00e1n in Si\u00e1lkot, passes into Lahore District, and finally joins the R\u00e1vi in Montgomery District in lat. $31^\\circ 2'$ N., long. $73^\\circ 24'$ E. The Degh is a river of the lower slopes, and consequently depends entirely for water-supply upon the local rainfall; but its channel in the upper portion never runs dry. In Si\u00e1lkot District, a fringe of alluvial land lines the bank, and the current shifts constantly from side to side of the wide valley; but artificial irrigation is only practised by means of Persian wheels in a few isolated spots, where the banks rise somewhat higher than usual above the river bed. Large areas, however, benefit by the silt deposited from the summer floods. At Tapi\u00e1la, in Lahore District, the Degh divides into two branches,\u2014the western of which is only full of water during the rainy season,\u2014and these join again near the village of Dhenga. Below Udeheri, irrigation can be effected by the natural flow of the water, the banks having subsided almost to the river's edge. Excellent rice grows upon the lands submerged by the inundations. In Montgomery District, the Degh again flows between high banks, but still contains sufficient water for irrigation. Its course in this portion of its course is remarkably straight, and it presents all the appearance of an artificial canal. So much water is withdrawn for agricultural purposes during its upper course, that the bed not unfrequently runs dry by the time it reaches Montgomery District. Several bridges span the Degh, notably an ancient one of very curious construction, at the point where it passes from Si\u00e1lkot into Lahore, besides two at Pindi D\u00e1s and Hod\u00ed\u00e1l, erected by the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr.\n\nDehej.\u2014Seaport in the W\u00e1gra Sub-division, Broach District, Bombay Presidency; situated in lat. $21^\\circ 42' 45''$ N., and long. $72^\\circ 38' 30''$ E., on the right bank of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda), about 3 miles from the sea, and 26 miles west of Broach. Houses, 618. Population (1881) about 2000. The port, though convenient of approach, does not admit of boats of more than 55 tons burthen. In 1804 it was closed, and opened again in 1819. Dehej was formerly the chief town of a fiscal division of 12 villages, which first came under British rule in 1780. This tract was ceded to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in 1783, and recovered in 1818 on the final overthrow of the Peshwa's power. Mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari.\nDehli.\u2014Division, District, and City, Punjab.\u2014See Delhi.\n\nDeh-peh.\u2014Lake in Okepo township, Henzada District, Irawadi Division, British Burma; situated near the foot of the eastern slopes of the Pegu Yoma hills, covering an area of nearly a square mile. Supplied principally by the drainage from the neighbouring hills; during the rains it has a depth of 9 feet, but in the dry season of only 1 or 2 feet.\n\nDehra.\u2014Tahsil in Dehra D\u00fan District, North-Western Provinces, comprising the whole of the eastern and western D\u00fans. Area (1882) 715 square miles, of which 78 are cultivated; population (1881) 98,953; land revenue, \u00a33850; total Government revenue, \u00a34721; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a314,393; incidence of Government revenue per acre, 2d. The tahsil contains 1 civil and 8 criminal courts, with 14 th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles. Strength of regular police, 196 men, besides 53 town police and 106 village watchmen.\n\nDehra.\u2014Town, cantonment, and administrative head-quarters of Dehra D\u00fan District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 30\u00b0 19' 59\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 5' 57\" E. Prettily situated in the midst of a mountain valley, at an elevation of more than 2300 feet above sea-level. Population (1881) 18,959, namely, Hindus, 13,307; Muhammadans, 4801; Jains, 88; Christians, 711; and 'others,' 52. Area of town site, 2315. Founded by Guru R\u00e1m R\u00e1i, who settled in the D\u00fan at the end of the 17th century. His temple, a handsome building in the style of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr's tomb, forms the chief architectural ornament of the town. The native city also contains a tahs\u00edl, police station, jail, and schools. The European quarter lies to the north, and has a fixed English population of some 600 persons, being one of the largest in the North-Western Provinces. To the west stand the cantonments of the 2nd G\u00farkha Rifles, or Sirm\u00far Battalion. English Church, Roman Catholic and Presbyterian chapels; dispensary, which in 1883 relieved a total number of 16,263 patients; post-office; head-quarters of Trigonometrical Survey. A large and successful mission of the American Presbyterian Church takes a prominent part in education. Municipal revenue (1883), \u00a3951, of which \u00a3599 was derived from taxation; incidence of taxation, 1s. per head of municipal population.\n\nDehra D\u00fan.\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces, lying between 29\u00b0 57' and 30\u00b0 59' N. lat., and between 77\u00b0 37' 15\" and 78\u00b0 22' 45\" E. long., with an area of 1193 square miles, and a population (1881) of 144,070 persons. Dehra D\u00fan forms the northern District of the Meerut (Merath) Division. It is bounded on the north by Independent Garhw\u00e1l, on the west by Sirm\u00far and Amb\u00e1la (Umballa) District, on the south by Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, and on the east by British and Independent Garhw\u00e1l. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Dehra.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Dehra D\u00fan consists of two distinct\nportions\u2014the double valley of Dehra proper, and the outlying mountain tract of Jauns\u00e1r B\u00e1war. It projects northward from the alluvial uplands of the Do\u00e1b, like an irregular triangle, towards the sources of the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1) and the main range of the Him\u00e1layas. To the south, the Siw\u00e1lik hills, a mass of Him\u00e1layan d\u00e9bris, shut off the District from the level and fertile plain below. Between these hills and the great mountain chain, whose farthest outliers they form, lie the two valleys known as the Eastern and Western D\u00fans; the former sloping down toward the stream of the Ganges, while the latter descends by wooded undulations to the bed of its principal confluent, the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1). The scenery of these mountain dales can hardly be surpassed for picturesque beauty even among the lovely slopes of the massive chain to which they belong. The perennial streams nourish a fresh and luxuriant vegetation, whilst the romantic hills to the south and the sterner mountains on the north give an exquisite variety to the landscape. A connecting ridge, which runs from north to south between the two systems, forms the watershed of the great rivers, and divides the Eastern from the Western D\u00fan. The Ganges, passing between this District and Garhw\u00e1l, pours rapidly over beds of boulder, through several channels, encircling jungle-clad islets, and debouches at length upon the plains at Hardw\u00e1r. The Jumna sweeps round the whole south-western boundary, and reaches the level uplands near B\u00e4dsh\u00e1h Mah\u00e1l, in Sah\u00e1ranpur District, an ancient hunting-seat of the Delhi Emperors. Their tributaries have little importance, except for artificial irrigation. When the District first passed under British rule, remains of ancient dams, tanks, and canals studded its surface; but these works had fallen completely out of use during the anarchic period of Sikh and G\u00farkha incursions. Our officers at once turned their attention to the restoration of the ancient channels, or the construction of others; and a number of diminutive but valuable irrigation canals now traverse both valleys in every direction, spreading cultivation over all available portions of their rugged surface. North of the D\u00fan proper, the massive block of mountains known as Jauns\u00e1r B\u00e1war fills in the space between the valleys of the Tons on the west and the Jumna on the east and south. The latter river, bending sharply westward from the Garhw\u00e1l boundary, divides this northern tract from the D\u00fan, and unites with its tributary the Tons near the Sirm\u00far frontier. Jauns\u00e1r B\u00e1war consists of a confused mass of rocks, evidently upheaved by volcanic action. Forests of deodara, oak, and fir still clothe large spaces on the hill-sides; but cultivation can only be carried on by means of terraces cut along the mountain slopes, and artificially irrigated by dams upon the numerous minor streams. The wild elephant ranges over the Siw\u00e1lik chain; while tigers, leopards, sloth bears, spotted or other deer, and monkeys abound in the remoter jungles. Wild elephants\noccasionally do considerable damage to the crops, but their capture is regulated by Government rules. Among game birds may be mentioned the black and grey partridge, pea-fowl, floriken, snipe, woodcock, pheasant, etc. Birds of prey include several varieties of eagle, vulture, kite, hawk, etc. The rivers abound in fish, the mahsir, a species of carp, being commonly caught from 40 to 60 pounds in weight, and frequently of a larger size. The smaller streams swarm with trout, sal, rohi, etc. Crocodiles, both of the snub-nosed and bottle-nosed varieties, are common, as is also a repulsive species of fresh-water shark.\n\nHistory.\u2014In the earliest ages of Hindu legend, Dehra D\u00fan formed part of the mythical region known as Ked\u00e1rk\u00fand, the abode of the great god Siva, whose sovereignty is still commemorated in the name of the Siw\u00e1lik hills. Many generations later, according to the most ancient myths of the Aryan settlers, the valley became bound up with the two great epics of the R\u00e1m\u00e1yan\u00e1 and Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata. Hither came R\u00e1ma and his brother, to do penance for the death of the demon-king R\u00e1vana; and here sojourned the five P\u00e1ndava brethren, on their way to the inner recesses of the snowy range, where they finally immolated themselves upon the sacred peak of Mah\u00e1 Panth. Another memorable legend connects the origin of the little river Susw\u00e1 with the prayers of 60,000 pigmy Br\u00e1hmans, whom Indra, the rain-god, had laughed to scorn when he saw them vainly endeavouring to cross the vast lake formed by a cow\u2019s footprint filled with water. The indignant pigmies set to work, by means of penance and mortifications, to create a second Indra, who should supersede the reigning god; and when their sweat had collected into the existing river, the irreverent deity, alarmed at the surprising effect of their devotions, appeased their wrath through the good offices of Brahma. Traditions of a snake, B\u00e1mun, who became lord of the D\u00fan on the summit of the N\u00e1gsidh Hill, seem to point towards a period of N\u00e1g\u00e1 supremacy. The famous K\u00e1lsi stone, near Haripur, on the right bank of the Jumna, inscribed with an edict of the Buddhist Emperor Asoka, may mark the ancient boundary between India and the Chinese Empire. It consists of a large quartz boulder, standing on a ledge which overhangs the river, and is covered with the figure of an elephant, besides an inscription in the ordinary character of the period. Hwen Thsang does not mention any cities which can be identified as lying within the present District; and tradition asserts that it remained without inhabitants until the 11th century, when a passing caravan of Banj\u00e1r\u00e1s, struck with the beauty of the country, permanently settled on the spot.\n\nAuthentic history, however, knows nothing of Dehra D\u00fan till the 17th century, when it formed a portion of the Garhw\u00e1l kingdom. The town of Dehra owes its origin to the heretical Sikh Guru, R\u00e1m R\u00e1i, a Hindu anti-pope, who was driven from the Punjab and the Sikh apostolate\nby doubts as to the legitimacy of his birth, and obtained recommendations from the Emperor Aurangzeb to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Garhw\u00e1l. His presence in the D\u00fan shortly attracted numerous devotees, and the village of Gurudw\u00e1ra, or Dehra, grew up around the saint's abode. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Fateh S\u00e1h endowed his temple, a curious building of Muhammadan architecture, with the revenue of three estates. The Guru possessed the singular and miraculous power of dying at will, and returning to life after a concerted interval; but on one occasion, having mistaken his reckoning, he never revived, and the bed on which he died still forms a particular object of reverence to the devout worshippers at his cenotaph. Monuments of earlier date, erected by one R\u00e1n\u00ed Karn\u00e1vati, still exist at Nuw\u00e1d\u00e1. Fateh S\u00e1h died soon after the arrival of R\u00e1m R\u00e1i, and was succeeded (1699) by his infant grandson, Part\u00e1p S\u00e1h, whose reign extended over the greater part of a century. But the flourishing condition of his domain soon attracted the attention of Naj\u00edb Daul\u00e1, governor of Sah\u00e1ranpur, who crossed the Siw\u00e1l\u00edks with a Rohilla army in 1757, and occupied the D\u00fan without serious opposition. Under Naj\u00edb Khan's benevolent and enlightened administration, the District rose to an unexampled degree of wealth and prosperity. Canals and wells irrigated the mountain-sides, Muhammadan colonists brought capital to develop the latent resources of the soil; and mango topes, still standing amid apparently primeval forest, bear witness even now to the flourishing agriculture of this happy period. But Naj\u00edb's death in 1770 put an end to the sudden prosperity of the D\u00fan. Henceforth a perpetual inundation of R\u00e1jputs, G\u00fajars, Sikhs, and G\u00farkhas swept over the valley, till the once fertile garden degenerated again into a barren waste. Four R\u00e1j\u00e1s followed one another on the throne; but the real masters were the turbulent tribes on every side, who levied constant black-mail from the unfortunate cultivators.\n\nMeanwhile, the G\u00farkhas, a race of mixed Nep\u00e1li origin, were advancing westward, and reached at last the territories of Garhw\u00e1l. In 1803, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Pardum\u00e1n S\u00e1h fled before them from Sr\u00ednagar into the D\u00fan, and thence to Sah\u00e1ranpur, while the savage G\u00farkha host overran the whole valley unopposed. Their occupation of Dehra D\u00fan coincided in time with the British entry into Sah\u00e1ranpur, and the great earthquake of 1803 proved the miraculous harbinger of either event. The G\u00farkhas ruled their new acquisition with a rod of iron, so that the District threatened to become an absolute desert. Under the severe fiscal arrangements of the G\u00farkha governors, slavery increased with frightful rapidity, every defaulter being condemned to lifelong bondage, and slaves being far cheaper in the market than horses or camels. From this unhappy condition, the advent of British rule rescued the feeble and degraded people.\n\nThe constant aggressions of the G\u00farkhas against our frontier com-\npelled the Government to declare war in November 1814. Dehra was immediately occupied, while our forces laid siege to the strong hill fortress of K\u00e1langa, which fell after a gallant defence, with great loss to the besieging party. The remnant of its brave garrison entered the service of Ranjit Singh, and afterwards died to a man in battle with the Afgh\u00e1ns. A resolution of Government, dated 17th November 1815, ordered the annexation of our new possession to Sah\u00e1ranpur; while the G\u00farkhas, by a treaty drawn up in the succeeding month, formally ceded the country. The organization of the District on a British model proceeded rapidly; and in spite of an ineffectual rising of the disaffected G\u00fajars and other predatory classes, led by a bandit named Kalw\u00e1, in 1824, peace was never again seriously disturbed. Under the energy and perseverance of its first English officials, the D\u00fan rapidly recovered its prosperity. Roads and canals were constructed, cultivation spread over the waste lands; and the people themselves, awaking from their previous apathy, began to acquire habits of industry and self-reliance. Jauns\u00e1r B\u00e1war, historically an integral portion of Sirm\u00far, had been conquered in the same campaign as the D\u00fan; but was at first erected into a separate charge under a Commissioner subordinate to the Resident at Delhi. In 1829, however, it was incorporated with the present District, of which it has ever since formed a part. The Mutiny of 1857 produced little effect in this remote dependency, cut off by the Siwal\u00edks from direct contact with the centres of disaffection in the Do\u00e1b or the Delhi Division; and though a party of Jalandhar insurgents, 600 strong, crossed the Jumna into Dehra D\u00fan, they traversed the District without stopping, and never came into collision with the pursuing troops.\n\n**Population.**\u2014It is probable that the number of the inhabitants has more than trebled since the introduction of British rule. The first regular Census, however, took place as lately as 1865, and it returned a total population of 102,831. In 1872, the numbers had risen to 116,945, showing an increase of 14,114 persons, or 13\u00b77 per cent. By 1881, the population had further risen to 144,070, showing an increase of 27,125, or 23\u00b72 per cent. since 1872. The principal results arrived at by the Census of 1881 may be briefly summarised as follows:\u2014Area of District, 1193 square miles; number of towns and villages, 966; number of houses, 32,942. Total population, 144,070, namely, males 83,985, and females 60,085; proportion of males in total population, 58\u00b73 per cent. Average density of population, 121 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 0\u00b781; persons per village, 149; houses per square mile, 27\u00b76; inmates per house, 4\u00b73. Classified according to religion, the Census Report returned the population as follows:\u2014Hindus, 125,223, or 86\u00b79 per cent.; Muhammadans, 16,527, or 11\u00b75 per cent.; Christians, 2025, or 1\u00b74 per cent.; Sikhs, 160; and Jains, 134.\nThe leading Hindu castes comprise the Br\u00e1hmans (17,274) and R\u00e1jputs (37,550), each of which has two broad sub-divisions into mountain and lowland clans. The latter regard themselves as vastly superior to their hill brethren, and lose caste by intermarriage with them. The highland Br\u00e1hmans will eat any kind of meat except beef. The other Hindu castes, numbering over 2000, in the District are as follows:\u2014Ah\u00edr, shepherds and cultivators, 2027; Baniy\u00e1, traders, 2932; Barh\u00e1i, carpenters, 2999; Bhang\u00ed, a very low caste of sweepers, and engaged in other menial occupations, 10,781; Cham\u00e1r, another very low caste, engaged as skinners and leather dressers, 16,715; Kah\u00e1r, labourers, palanquin-bearers, and domestic servants, 4576; Kor\u00ed, 8669, and Lodh\u00ed, 2930, the two principal cultivating castes; Loh\u00e1r, blacksmiths and iron-workers, 2050. The G\u00fajars, immigrant plunderers of the last century, still retain several villages, but they only numbered 529 in 1881.\n\nAmong the lower castes, the Mehras and Dh\u00fams possess the greatest interest, as being the probable representatives of the aborigines before the tide of Aryan immigration had set in. The Mehras inhabit the remoter portions of the Eastern D\u00fan, inferior both in physique and intelligence, and timidly averse to intercourse with strangers. The Dh\u00fams have dingy black skins and woolly hair; they form the servile class, only just emancipated from actual slavery under British rule, and still retaining many traces of their ancient status. Their number is not returned separately in the Census Report. With the exception of 167 Shi\u00e1s, the whole of the Muhammadans belong to the Sunn\u00ed sect. They have secured few proselytes, except among the wretched Dh\u00fams, and these generally prefer Christianity to Isl\u00e1m. The Christian community consists of 1291 Europeans and Eurasians, and 734 natives; but the Census Report does not return the Christian population according to sect for each District.\n\nThe District contained only one town in 1881 whose population exceeded 5000, namely, Dehra, with 18,959 inhabitants. The sanitaria of Masuri (Mussooree) and Landaur, now united into a single town, contain a large number of permanent residents (3106 in February 1881), and attract many visitors from the plains during the hot season. Kals\u00ed, the ancient mart of Jauns\u00e1r B\u00e1war, has now sunk to the position of a country village; while the cantonment of \u00c7hakrata, high among the mountains, has succeeded to local importance as the modern capital of the tract. Of the 966 villages, no less than 824 contained, in 1881, fewer than two hundred inhabitants; 111 from two hundred to five hundred; 19 from five hundred to a thousand; 9 from one thousand to two thousand; 2 from three thousand to five thousand; and 1 upwards of fifteen thousand inhabitants. As regards occupation, the Census Report divides the male population into the following six main classes:\u2014Class (1) Professional, including civil and military and the\nprofessional classes, 3367; (2) domestic servants, keepers of lodging-houses, etc., 2379; (3) commercial, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 2125; (4) agricultural, including cultivators, gardeners, and cattle and sheep tenders, 29,989; (5) manufacturing and industrial class, including artisans, 12,249; (6) indefinite and non-productive (including 9595 general labourers, and 24,281 male children and unspecified), 33,876. The language in ordinary use consists of a very corrupt dialect of Hindi.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Out of a total area of 1193 square miles, only 106 were cultivated in 1881, 33 square miles were cultivable, and 1021 square miles uncultivable waste. Tillage is chiefly confined to the valleys, or to terraces on the mountain slopes, artificially irrigated by dams and canals. The agricultural year follows the same seasons as in the Do\u00e1b. The kharif, or autumn harvest, consists chiefly of rice, the inferior kinds of which can be grown in land entirely dependent on the rainfall for its water-supply. Jo\u00e1r, til, and sugar-cane form supplementary autumn crops. The rabi, or spring harvest, falls far short of the kharif in quantity. Its staples comprise wheat and barley, with very few inferior grains. The District produces no surplus for exportation; and since the hill stations of Masur\u00ed and Chakr\u00e1ta have risen into importance, a considerable amount of food-stuffs is annually imported for their supply. On the other hand, Dehra D\u00fan now raises tea for exportation to the plains, while timber and other forest produce turn the balance of trade in its favour. The cultivation of the Rhea fibre or China grass was attempted a few years ago, but the experiment proved a failure, and the cultivation has now been abandoned. Irrigation in 1881 was carried on over 9869 acres by means of Government works, and over 21,953 acres by private enterprise. Unirrigated area, 35,378 acres, or nearly one-half of the total area under cultivation. Government has endeavoured to promote the reclamation of the waste lands which abound in all parts of the District, by means of grants to European capitalists; but hitherto little success has attended these enterprises. A grant of a large tract of land in the Eastern D\u00fan has recently been given to Messrs. Lister & Co., a wealthy Yorkshire silk firm, for the purpose of introducing sericulture, but the experiment has not yet (1883) reached a stage to justify predictions as to its success or otherwise. The various agricultural staples cover the following estimated areas:\u2014Wheat, 12,890 acres; barley, 5228 acres; rice, 13,743 acres; mandiv\u00e1, 6412 acres. The average out-turn of wheat per acre may be set down at 11 cwts. per acre, valued at \u00a31, 5s.; and that of barley at 15 cwts. per acre, valued at \u00a31, 1s. Nearly three-fifths of the land is held by tenants with rights of occupancy. Average incidence of Government land revenue, 1s. 0\u00bcd. per acre; average rent paid by cultivators, 3s. 9d. per acre. In the D\u00fan proper, the peasantry have not yet extricated themselves from a\ncondition of indebtedness to the village banker; but in Jauns\u00e1r B\u00e1war they occupy a comparatively enviable position, free from debt, and usually cultivating their own little farms themselves. On the tea plantations, labour obtains excellent wages, which prove quite sufficient to attract Afgh\u00e1ns and other foreigners into competition with natives of the D\u00fan. Ordinary field-labourers receive generally 3d. per diem. Famine has never occurred within the historical period; and it is believed that, among a people so favourably situated as regards the demand for labour, its future occurrence may be considered a very remote contingency. The average prices of food-stuffs for the ten years ending 1880 ruled as follows:\u2014Common rice, 12 sers per rupee, or 9s. 4d. per cwt.; best rice, 9 sers per rupee, or 12s. 5d. per cwt.; wheat, 17 sers per rupee, or 6s. 7d. per cwt.; barley, 25 sers per rupee, or 4s. 6d. per cwt.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The traffic of Dehra D\u00fan has two main channels, leading from the valley to the plains and to the hills respectively. The exports toward the lowlands include timber, bamboo, lime, charcoal, rice, and above all, tea. The total annual value of the latter article raised within the District is estimated at \u00a320,000. Some of it has even found its way, through Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, to the Russians in Central Asia. In return, the D\u00fan imports from the plains hardware, cotton cloth, blankets, salt, sugar, grain, tobacco, fruits, and spices. All these articles pass on also to the hills; while the return trade consists of rice, ginger, turmeric, red pepper, honey, wax, lac, gum, resin, and other forest produce. With the exception of English-made beer, which is manufactured to a considerable extent by two breweries at Masur\u00ed, no manufactures of more than local importance exist. The mode of carriage is confined to bullock-carts, and the carrying trade remains chiefly in the hands of Banj\u00e1ras. The District has only one bridged and metalled road, from As\u00e1mri to R\u00e1jpur, along which goes the traffic from the plains through the Mohan Pass, pierced by a causeway 7 miles long. Fair second-class roads connect the other centres of population with the principal passes of the Him\u00e1layas or the Siw\u00e1liks. The hill stations, however, can only be reached by means of horse-paths. Four printing-presses exist in the District, and an English newspaper is published at Masur\u00ed.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1881, Dehra D\u00fan District contained 3 covenanted officers, the chief of whom bore the title of Superintendent, with the powers of a Magistrate and Collector. The total revenue raised in Dehra D\u00fan during 1874\u201375 was returned at \u00a36308, of which sum \u00a35797 was due to the land-tax. By 1880\u201381, the gross revenue of the District had increased to \u00a328,162, of which \u00a36211 were derived from the land. The total cost of civil administration, as represented by the cost of officials and police of all kinds,\nwas \u00a310,454. The District contained in 1881, 9 Magistrates and 6 civil and revenue judges. The number of policemen of all kinds amounted to 370, being at the rate of 1 constable to every 3'2 square miles of area and every 391 persons. The District jail and lock-up at Dehra D\u00fan contained a daily average of 75 inmates in 1880, of whom 72 were males and 3 females. In education, the District still remains very backward. In 1875-76, the number of inspected schools was returned at 32, with an aggregate roll of 1196 pupils; while in 1880-81, the inspected schools numbered 39, with an attendance roll of 1240 pupils, giving an average of 1 school to every 30'6 square miles, and 8'4 pupils per thousand of the population. There are also a few unimportant uninspected village schools. The Census Report in 1880-81 returned a total of 1368 boys and 310 girls under instruction; and 6295 males and 578 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. The American Mission at Dehra, established in 1853, has taken a deep interest in educational matters, and maintains a female school and girls' orphanage. For fiscal and administrative purposes, the District is sub-divided into 2 tahsils and 3 parganas. Municipalities have been established at Dehra and Masuri. In 1880-81, their joint revenue amounted to \u00a33798, of which \u00a32983 was derived from taxation; expenditure, \u00a33062.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Extremes of heat and cold are unknown in the Dehra D\u00fan. The proximity of the Himalayas cools the atmosphere; the warm blasts from the plain do not reach so far among the mountain valleys, while the heavy summer monsoons bring abundant showers, and even in May or June occasional rainfall refreshes the country. The rainfall varies considerably in different parts of the District, the average for 20 years ranging from 57'62 inches at Chakrata, to 75'78 inches at Dehra, 95'54 inches at Masuri, and 123'19 inches at Bhogpur. The temperature generally fluctuates between 37\u00b0 and 101\u00b0 F.; but at the sanitarium of Masuri (Mussooree), 6000 feet above sea-level, the thermometer has a range from 27\u00b0 to 80\u00b0. Earthquakes occasionally occur, but seldom cause serious damage. The total number of deaths recorded in the District in 1881 amounted to 2994, being at the rate of 20'7 per 1000 of the population. During the same year, the Government charitable dispensaries at Dehra and Masuri gave relief to 20,042 out-door and 833 in-door patients.

Population (1881) 3512. Now noted as the site of the head-works of the Son Canals, and of the workshops designed by Mr. Fouracres in 1869\u201370, to construct and maintain the various stone, wood, and iron works distributed over the canal system. A training school was opened at Dehra in 1872 with the object of recruiting the upper subordinate establishments of the Public Works Department, European, Eurasian, and native lads being taken as indentured apprentices; but this school has recently been removed to S\u00edbpur at Howrah, opposite Calcutta. To the north of Dehri town is a large indigo factory, the property of Messrs. Gisborne & Co. In 1871, a convict camp was established at Dehri, as an experiment on a large scale, for the out-door employment of prisoners on remunerative public works. The prisoners were mainly employed on canal works connected with the Irrigation Department, till 1875, when they were moved to Baxar.\n\nDelhi (Delhi).\u2014Division or Commissionership in the Punjab, lying between 27\u00b0 39' and 30\u00b0 11' N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 13' and 77\u00b0 35' E. long.; comprising the three Districts of Delhi, Gurgaon, and Karnal, each of which see separately. Area (1881) 5610 square miles, with 2724 towns and villages; number of houses, 295,270, of which 207,616 are occupied and 87,654 are unoccupied; number of resident families, 413,499. Total population, 1,907,984, namely, males 1,019,104, and females 888,880; proportion of males in total population, 53.4 per cent. Average density, 340 persons per square mile; average persons per town or village, 700 (including Delhi City); inmates per house, 9.2. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Hindus, 1,376,258, or 72.13 per cent.; Muhammadans, 504,623, or 26.44 per cent.; Jains, 15,768; Sikhs, 9133; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 27; Christians, 2172; and \u2018others,\u2019 3. Of a total population of 1,907,984 persons, 936,954 are agriculturists, 305,909 being returned as males of fifteen years of age and upwards. The total area of land paying Government revenue or quit-rent is returned at 5166 square miles, of which 3201 square miles are under cultivation, and 987 cultivable. Total amount of Government land revenue and cesses, \u00a3303,379; total rental paid by cultivators, including cesses, \u00a3622,366.\n\nDelhi (Delhi).\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab (Panjab), lying between 28\u00b0 12' and 29\u00b0 13' N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 51' 15\" and 77\u00b0 34' 45\" E. long., with an area of 1277 square miles, and a population in 1881 of 643,515. Delhi forms the Central District in the Division of the same name. It is bounded on the north by Karnal, on the west by Rohtak, on the south by Gurgaon, and on the east by the river Jumna (Jamun\u00e1), which divides it from the Districts\nof Meerut (Mirath) and Bulandshahr in the North-Western Provinces. The administrative head-quarters are at the city of Delhi, the ancient capital of the Mughal Empire.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Delhi forms the meeting place for the alluvial plain of the Jumna valley and the last outlying ridges of the Rajputana Hills. Its northern portion presents the usual monotonous features which characterize the dry lowlands of the Cis-Sutlej (Satlaj) tract; but the waters of the Western Jumna Canal, which traverses the whole length of the tract, produce splendid crops wherever they do not collect in pestilential marshes, or by raising the salts of the soil to the surface, render vegetation impossible, as in parts of Karnal District (q.v.). Only near the Jumna does the nature of the soil exhibit any variety or increased fruitfulness; but along the actual verge of the river an alluvial margin, some 10 miles in width, fringing the bank, marks the western limit of the ancient bed of the main channel, which has gradually receded eastward during the course of ages, leaving a considerable cliff far to the west, the only vestige of its original path. As the river approaches the city of Delhi, however, this lowland region rapidly contracts in width, terminating about a mile above the town, where an offshoot of the Mewat Hills abuts upon the water's edge in a wide stony plateau. The range to which this northernmost outlier belongs may be considered as a prolongation of the Aravalli system. It enters the District from Gurgaon on the southern border, and immediately expands into a rocky table-land, some 3 miles in breadth, running in a north-easterly direction nearly across the District. Ten miles south of the city, the range divides into two branches, one of which, turning sharply to the south-west, re-enters the borders of Gurgaon; while the other continues its northerly course as a narrow ridge of sandstone, and, passing to the west of Delhi, finally loses itself in the valley of the Jumna. The whole table-land nowhere attains an elevation of more than 500 feet above the lowlands at its base; while its surface consists of barren rock, too destitute of water for the possibility of cultivation, even in the few rare patches of level soil. Nevertheless, the neighbouring villages of the lowland tract have allotted this stony plateau among their various communities, and watch over their respective boundaries with the utmost jealousy. The land is only valuable as inferior grazing ground. At the very foot of the hills, a few villages derive fertility from the torrents which course through the ravines during the rainy season, and spread their waters over the flat plain below, thus preparing the soil for the reception of the autumn sowing. The Najafgarh jhil or lake, a shallow scattered sheet of water, covers a considerable surface in the south-east of the District, the area submerged amounting in October to about 27,900 acres. The Jumna, before reaching the borders of Delhi, has been so greatly drained of its\nwaters for the two older canals which it feeds, that it forms only a narrow stream, fordable at almost any point except during the rains; while at Okhla, a short distance below the city, the whole remaining cold-weather supply is drafted off into the new Agra Canal. Water, however, reappears a few miles lower down. At the heads of the Eastern and Western Jumna Canals the river can often be crossed dry-shod immediately below the dam. But the water which flows under the riverbed, among the boulders and sand, presently reappears and restores the stream.\n\nHistory.\u2014The tract immediately surrounding the Mughal capital can hardly be said to possess any history of its own, apart from that of the city, which will be found in full under the proper heading. From the earliest period of Aryan colonization in India, the point where the central hills first abut upon the Jumna seems to have formed the site for one great metropolis after another. The whole country, for some 10 or 12 miles around the modern Delhi, and particularly in the south and south-east, is covered with the d\u00e9bris of ruined cities, whose remains extend over an estimated area of 45 square miles. First upon the list of successive capitals stands the name of Indrapr\u00e1stha, a city founded (as General Cunningham believes) not later than the 15th century B.C., by the earliest Aryan immigrants into India, when they first began to feel their way along the tangled jungles of the Jumna valley. The Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata vaguely enshrines the memory of this primitive settlement, and tells how the five P\u00e1ndavas, leading an Aryan host from Hastinapur upon the Ganges, expelled or subdued the savage N\u00e1g\u00e1s, the aboriginal inhabitants; how, having cleared their land of forest, they founded the stronghold of Indrapr\u00e1stha, which grew into a great kingdom; and how at last, as the Aryan race became strong enough for discord, they turned their arms against their own kinsmen, the Kauravas, whom they overthrew in a great war, the central theme of the Hindu Iliad. Yudhisthira, the founder of Indrapr\u00e1stha, was succeeded on the throne by thirty generations of collateral descendants, until at length his line was extinguished by the usurpation of Visarwa, minister of the last P\u00e1ndavite sovereign. Visarwa's family retained the sceptre for 500 years, and was then followed, with the usual symmetry of early Indian mythical lore, by a dynasty of fifteen Gautamas. In the middle of the 1st century B.C., the name of Delhi makes its earliest appearance in tradition or history; and thenceforth the annals of the District become identical with those of the whole Upper Indian Empire. Passing in succession under the rule of Hindus, Path\u00e1ns, Mughals, and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Delhi came at length into the hands of the British, after Lord Lake's victories in 1803. The tract then ceded to the Company included a considerable strip to the west of the Jumna, both north and south of the Mughal capital. The Governor-General assigned a large\nportion of the territory thus acquired for the maintenance and dignity of the royal family of Delhi. Sh\u00e1h Alam, released from his Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 jailors, received as private domain for this purpose the greater part of the present Districts of Delhi and Hiss\u00e1r. A Resident and Chief Commissioner undertook the entire control of the fiscal arrangements, and exercised a general supervision over the criminal jurisdiction; but the king retained exclusive power within the palace walls, while British officials administered Muhammadan law in his name throughout the assigned region. A few native princes, however, still held their independent estates within the Delhi territory, the principal instance in the present District being the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ballabgharh. The anomalous mode of government thus instituted was obviously inconsistent with the full authority of the central power; and, in 1832, it became desirable to introduce a more practicable system of administration. A Regulation of that year abolished the office of Resident and Chief Commissioner, transferred the executive power to a Commissioner in correspondence with the Government of the North-Western Provinces, and vested the judicial functions in the High Court of Agra. This enactment placed the administration of the Delhi territory, nominally as well as actually, in the hands of the East India Company. The territory continued to form part of the North-Western Provinces up till the Mutiny of 1857.\n\nAs early as 1819, a District of Delhi had been regularly constituted, including a part of the present Rohtak District, but since enlarged by additions from P\u00e1nipat tahsil in K\u00e1rn\u00e1l District, and from the confiscated principality of Ballabhgarh. On the outbreak of the Mutiny, the whole District passed for a time into the hands of the rebels; and though communications with the Punjab were soon restored, enabling us to recover the northern pargan\u00e1s, it was not till after the fall of Delhi City that British authority could reassert itself in the southern portion. When the final suppression of the Mutiny in 1858 enabled the work of reconstruction to proceed, Delhi District was transferred to the newly-formed Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab. At the same time, the territories of the insurgent R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ballabhgarh, who had been executed for rebellion, were confiscated and added as a new tahsil to the District; while the outlying Do\u00e1b villages, hitherto belonging to Delhi, and known as the Eastern Pargan\u00e1, were handed over to the North-Western Provinces. Since the banishment of the dethroned Emperor to Rangoon, where he died in 1862, the District has enjoyed peaceful administration.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The frequent changes of boundary, both in the District as a whole and in its component pargan\u00e1s, render it impossible to institute a comparison between the results shown by the Census of 1853, under the Government of the North-Western Provinces, and those of the Census of 1868, under the Punjab administration. The latter enumeration, taken over an area of 1276 square miles, disclosed a total\npopulation of 608,850 persons, distributed among 772 villages or townships, and inhabiting an aggregate of 168,390 houses. The Census of February 17, 1881, returns the area at 1276 square miles, and the population at 643,515. This population is distributed through 701 towns and villages, composed of an aggregate of 73,359 occupied and 35,624 unoccupied houses. These figures yield the following averages:\u2014Persons per square mile, 504; villages per square mile, 1.8; houses per square mile, 85; persons per village, 918; persons per house, 8.7. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 344,016; females, 299,499; proportion of males, 53.4 per cent. Classified according to age, there were, under 15 years\u2014males, 119,769; females, 102,086; total, 221,855, or over 34 per cent. of the total. As regards religious distinctions, the Hindus number 483,332; Muhammadans, 149,830; Sikhs, 970; Jains, 7336; Parsis, 27; Christians, 2017; and \u2018others,\u2019 3. These figures yield the following percentages:\u2014Hindus, 72.9%; Muhammadans, 23.2%; Jains, 1.1%; and all \u2018others,\u2019 2.8%. The classification with reference to occupations distributes the adult male population into the following six main groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including officials of every kind and the learned professions, 29,928; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 41,784; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 20,969; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including shepherds, 313,977; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 161,801; and (6) indefinite and non-productive class, including general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 83,855.\n\nOf the 701 towns and villages in the District in 1881, 140 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 240 between two and five hundred; 192 between five hundred and one thousand; 91 between one and two thousand; 26 between two and three thousand; 8 between three and five thousand; 2 between five and ten thousand; 7 between ten and fifteen thousand; and 1 more than fifty thousand.\n\nAmong the castes and tribes, the Jats come first with 107,075, remarkable here as elsewhere for industrious habits, agricultural skill, and promptitude in the payment of revenue. North of Delhi the greater part of the land is in their possession, though they often share their villages with Brahman coparceners. They are found more frequently in the uplands of the interior than in the alluvial fringe of the Jumna valley. Two classes of Jats are found in the neighbourhood of Delhi, the Deswala and the Pachade. The latter are a later immigration from the west, but do not differ materially from the former. The greater number profess the Sivaite creed of Hinduism. With regard to the distribution of castes and tribes, the following facts appear from the returns of the Census:\u2014Hindu Jats number 103,984; Muhammadan Jats, 2318; Sikh Jats, 765; \u2018others,\u2019 4. Hindu Rajputs number 23,282; Muham-\nmadan R\u00e1jputs, 10,511; Sikh R\u00e1jputs, 11; 'others,' 19. Hindu Br\u00e1hmans number 59,640; Muhammadan Br\u00e1hmans, 2333; and 'others,' 34. Path\u00e1ns number 15,969, all of them Muhammadans; Cham\u00e1rs, 63,407; G\u00fajars, 25,836; Ch\u00fahras, 26,067; Shaikhs, 50,195, all of them Muhammadans; B\u00e1luich\u00eds, 1318, all Muhammadans; Baniy\u00e1s, 42,414, all Hindus; N\u00e1is, 11,080; Lohars, 5934; Sayyids, all Muhammadans, 8800; Son\u00e1rs, 4085; Dhobis, 4157; Fak\u00edrs or begging-priest caste, 1428; Mughals, all Muhammadans, 5806; and Jog\u00eds, religious mendicants, 5006. The Br\u00e1hmans are most of them industrious cultivators, sharing villages with the J\u00e1ts, possibly as a remnant of some conquest-tenure, resembling the Sikh chah\u00e1rami of the Cis-Sutlej tract (see Umballa District). The Taga sub-division of Br\u00e1hmans is one of the most important in the District. They are of the Gaur family, and their tradition is that they were invited from Bengal for the purpose of exterminating snakes. Sir H. Elliot finds in this story an allusion to wars against 'Takshak Scythians' of a Buddhist creed. Possibly many of the Delhi Br\u00e1hmans are lineal descendants of the autochthonous Pand\u00e1vas or original Aryan dwellers in the District. The Baniy\u00e1s or trading classes are scattered as shopkeepers through the country villages, and form a large proportion of the mercantile body in Delhi itself. The idle and dishonest G\u00fajars (25,836) carry on their usual pastoral and semi-nomad avocations in the hilly plateau of the south, with no better reputation for cattle-lifting and thieving propensities than their clansmen elsewhere. The Path\u00e1ns are the only tribe of genuine Muhammadan origin, and still retain their nationality distinct. The Ah\u00edrs are a high-caste pastoral Hindu tribe. The District contains 4 towns with a population exceeding 5000, in 1881\u2014Delhi City, 173,393; Sonpat, 13,077; Faridabad, 7427; and Ballabhgarh, 5821. The aggregate urban population at the date of the Census amounted to 203,717 persons, or 31 per cent. of the District total. Urdu or Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed forms the prevailing dialect of all classes.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The District of Delhi had in 1882\u201383 a total cultivated area of 525,676 acres, of which 95,346 were irrigated from Government works, and 80,376 by private enterprise. The uncultivated area includes 10,115 acres of grazing land, 133,642 acres of cultivable waste, and 135,500 acres of barren rock or soil rendered useless by saline efflorescence. The north-western uplands are watered by the Western Jumna Canal, except in a few spots where the surface of the country rises above the level of the main channel. Cotton and sugar-cane here form the commercial staples of the autumn harvest, while rice, jod\u00e1r, bajra, and Indian corn are the chief food-grains. In the spring sowings, wheat, barley, and gram make up the principal crops; but tobacco covers a considerable area, and rice of excellent quality is produced wherever water is abundant. The cultivation of cotton is on the increase;\na ready market being obtained at Delhi. The kh\u00e1dar, or alluvial fringe of the Jumna, cannot compete with the artificially-irrigated uplands. The crops in this tract include the same general staples, but the produce is inferior in kind. Well-irrigation is almost everywhere possible throughout the kh\u00e1dar, sweet water being found a few feet below the surface. South of Delhi, the nature of the soil deteriorates. Most of the land belongs to the stony ridge which projects into the District from the Aravalli range; and though the new Agra Canal traverses this unfruitful region, its level is too low to permit of irrigation. The Najafgarh jhil, after being filled in the rains, is drained into the Jumna by an escape channel, and crops are then sown upon the submerged land; but only a partial success has hitherto attended the operations of the Canal Department in this respect, owing to the want of a sufficient fall. The following list shows the number of acres under each of the principal staples in 1882\u201383:\u2014Wheat, 138,753; barley, 63,289; gram, 56,653; Indian corn, 11,954; tobacco, 4200; rice, 16,406; jo\u00e1r, 71,238; b\u00e1jra, 90,255; cotton, 31,991; sugar-cane, 27,223. The Government returns of 1882\u201383 state the average out-turn per acre as follows:\u2014Rice, 1005 lbs.; cotton, 161 lbs.; tobacco, 737 lbs.; wheat, 635 lbs.; gram, 524 lbs.; barley, 895 lbs.; jo\u00e1r, 181 lbs.; indigo, 150 lbs.; oil-seeds, 168 lbs.; and inferior grains, 226 lbs. The tenures consist of the types common in the North-Western Provinces, to which Delhi belongs in natural position and historical antecedents. The holding known as bhay\u00e1ch\u00e1r\u00e1, or brotherhood, is the most frequent. The village communities are strong and united. From 50 to 100 acres would be considered a large holding for a cultivating proprietor; 20 would be regarded as above the average for a tenant; while 5 acres represent the whole farm in many cases. By far the greater number of tenants possess no permanent rights of occupancy. Rents vary much with the nature of the crop which the land is suited to produce. Rice lands fetch from 8s. to \u00a31 per acre; cotton lands, from 6s. to 16s.; sugar lands, from 10s. to \u00a31, 10s.; wheat lands, from 6s. to 16s.; indigo lands, from 10s. to 16s.; tobacco lands, from 10s. to \u00a31, 4s.; and dry lands, suitable for inferior grains, from 2s. to 8s. Wages are almost universally paid in money. Agricultural labourers received 4d., or 10 lbs. of wheat, per diem in 1881. Prices ruled as follows in 1883:\u2014Wheat, 19 sers per rupee, or 5s. 11d. per cwt.; barley, 20 sers per rupee, or 4s. 4d. per cwt.; gram, 24 sers per rupee, or 4s. 8d. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 25 sers per rupee, or 4s. 6d. per cwt.; b\u00e1jra, 22 sers per rupee, or 5s. 1d. per cwt.; rice, 5 sers per rupee; potatoes, 20 sers per rupee; sugar, 3 sers per rupee; tobacco, 2 sers per rupee; salt, 11 sers per rupee.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014The trade of the District centres almost entirely in the city of DELHI. Sonpat, Far\u00edd\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Ballabhgarh are local marts of some importance, but have no external transactions of any\nvalue. The manufactures are also confined to the capital, which has a high reputation for gold and silk embroidery, jewellery, and other ornamental goods of fine workmanship. The glazed ware of the District has a reputation second only to that of the similar ware of Peshawar. The District now lies a little apart from the main channel of trade, owing to the diversion caused by the great northern line of railway, which runs through the Do\u00e1b Districts on the other side of the Jumna. Nevertheless, the means of communication are amply sufficient, both by land and water. In 1882, there were 72 miles of navigable river, 116 miles of metalled and 293 of unmetalled roads, and 12 miles of railway. The East Indian Railway has a branch from Ghaziabad Junction, which crosses the Jumna by an iron bridge, and has a station within the city; and this branch is also used by the Punjab line. The Rajputana State Railway traverses the District for a short distance in the direction of Gurgaon. The Jumna is navigable during the rainy season for country boats of 400 maunds burden. Good metalled roads connect the city with Lahore, Agra, Jaipur (Jeypore), and Hissar; while a network of local trade-lines runs in every direction to the various minor towns and gh\u00e1ts. Bridges of boats lead across the river at Bh\u00e1gpat and Ch\u00e1nsa, Meniarpur, and Jhundpur; and the railway bridge at Delhi has an underway for ordinary wheel traffic.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District staff usually comprises a Deputy Commissioner, 1 Assistant and 2 extra-Assistant Commissioners, a judge of the Small Cause Court, 2 munsifs or subordinate magistrates, and 3 tahsild\u00e1rs, besides the usual medical, fiscal, and constabulary officials. The total revenue raised in the District in 1882\u201383 amounted to \u00a3112,702, of which \u00a379,479 was due to the land-tax. Among the other items, the chief were salt, customs, and stamps. For police purposes, the District is distributed into 13 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s). In 1882\u201383, the regular police numbered 1141 officers and men of all ranks, of whom 539 were District, 591 municipal, and 11 cantonment police. The police machinery was therefore 1 policeman to each square mile of area and to every 564 persons of the population. But as the city of Delhi alone has 457 policemen, the real proportion for the rural parg\u00e1ns may be more fairly estimated at 1 to every 2 square miles. The total number of persons brought to trial upon all charges, great or small, in 1882 amounted to 5227. The District jail, adapted from an old sar\u00e1\u00ed, had an aggregate of 1338 prisoners in 1882, with a daily average of 443 inmates. In the District lock-ups during the year 667 prisoners were received. Cost of maintenance of prisoners, \u00a32030. Education was carried on in 1882\u201383 by 118 schools and colleges, having a total roll of 6126 pupils. The principal establishments include an aided mission college, the Upper District School, the Anglo-Arabic School, and the classes in connection\nwith the mission of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. The Government Delhi College has been abolished within the last few years. For fiscal and administrative purposes, the District is sub-divided into 3 tahsils, with an aggregate of 800 villages, owned by 52,064 proprietors. Five towns within the District possess municipalities, namely, Delhi, Sonpat, Ballabgharh, Faridabad, and Najafgarh. In 1882-83, the aggregate municipal revenue amounted to \u00a331,211, or 3s. per head of the population (203,717) within municipal limits; municipal expenditure, \u00a325,400.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Delhi does not materially differ from that of other Districts in the Jumna basin. The maximum temperature in the shade in May 1882 was 116\u00b0 F.; the minimum in December, 46\u00b0 4'. The prevailing winds are north-westerly or westerly. The total annual rainfall amounted to 21.8 inches in 1869-70, 23.7 inches in 1870-71, and 33.1 inches in 1871-72. In 1882 it was 29.2 inches. The principal endemic diseases are fever and bowel complaints; but small-pox often commits severe ravages in an epidemic form. The total number of deaths recorded in 1882 was 20,122, being at the rate of 31 per thousand; and of these 12,263, or 19 per thousand, were due to fevers alone. The District contains 8 charitable dispensaries, which afforded relief in 1882 to 11,48 in-door and 55,982 out-door patients.

Lat. 28\u00b0 38' 58\" N., long. 77\u00b0 16' 30\" E. Population in 1881, 173,393 souls. Distant from Calcutta 954 miles, from Agra 113, from Allahabad 390 miles.\nSituation and General Appearance.\u2014The modern city of Delhi or Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d abuts on the right bank of the river Jumna, and is enclosed on three sides by a lofty wall of solid stone, constructed by the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, and subsequently strengthened by the English at the beginning of the present century with a ditch and glacis. The eastern side, where the city extends to the river bank, has no wall; but the high bank is faced with masonry. The circuit of the wall is $5\\frac{1}{2}$ miles. It has ten gates, of which the principal are the Kashmir and Mori gates on the north; the K\u00e1b\u00fal and Lahore gates on the east; and the Ajmere and Delhi gates on the south. The Imperial palace, now known as \u2018the fort,\u2019 is situated in the east of the city, and abuts directly on the river. It is surrounded on three sides by an imposing wall of red sandstone, with small round towers, and a gateway on the west and south. Since the Mutiny of 1857, a great portion has been demolished in order to make room for English barracks. South of the fort, in the Dari\u00e1ganj quarter of the city, is the cantonment for a regiment of native infantry, which, with one wing of a European regiment stationed within the fort, makes up the ordinary garrison of Delhi. On the opposite side of the river is the fortress of Sal\u00edmgarh, erected in the 16th century by Sal\u00edm Sh\u00e1h, and now in ruins. At this point the East Indian Railway enters the city by a magnificent bridge across the Jumna, passing over Sal\u00edmgarh, and through a corner of the fort, to the railway station within the city walls. Thence the line proceeds as the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na State Railway, and, after traversing the city, emerges through the wall on the north-west. In the north-eastern corner of the city, within the walls and close to the Kashmir gate, are situated the treasury and other public offices. Dari\u00e1ganj, the fort, the public offices, and the railway form an almost continuous line along the eastern and northern faces of the city, the angle between them being devoted to public gardens. The area thus occupied amounts to nearly one-half of the entire city; it presents a comparatively open appearance, and forms a marked contrast to the south-west quarter of the town, which is densely occupied by the shops and dwellings of the native population.\n\nThe architectural glories of Delhi are famous alike in Indian and European literature. It is impossible in a brief notice like the present to attempt any adequate description of them. They have been treated with admirable knowledge and artistic appreciation in Mr. Fergusson\u2019s History of Indian and Eastern Architecture (1876). The palace of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n\u2014now the fort\u2014perhaps less picturesque and sober in tone than that of Agra, has the advantage of being built on a more uniform plan, and by the most magnificent of the Royal builders of India. It forms a parallelogram, measuring 1600 feet east and west by 3200 north and south, exclusive of the gateways. Passing the deeply-recessed portal, a vaulted hall is entered, rising two storeys, 375 feet long, like the\nnave of a gigantic Gothic cathedral\u2014'the noblest entrance,' says Mr. Fergusson, 'to any existing palace.' Omitting all mention of the music hall and smaller holdings, or fountains, however beautiful, the celebrated *diw\u00e1n-i-kh\u00e1s* or Private Audience Hall forms, 'if not the most beautiful, certainly the most ornamented of all Jah\u00e1n's buildings. It overhangs the river, and nothing can exceed the delicacy of its inlaid work or the poetry of its design. It is round the roof of this hall that the famous inscription ran: 'If there is a heaven on earth, it is this\u2014it is this!' which may safely be rendered into the sober English assertion, that no palace now existing in the world possesses an apartment of such unique elegance. The whole of the area between the central range of buildings to the south, measuring about 1000 feet each way, was occupied, says Mr. Fergusson, by the harem and private apartments of the palace, covering, consequently, more than twice the area of the Escurial, or, in fact, of any palace in Europe. 'According to the native plan I possess (which I see no reason for distrusting), it contained three garden courts, and about thirteen or fourteen other courts, arranged some for state, some for convenience; but what they were like we have no means of knowing. Not a vestige of them now remains. Of the public parts of the palace, all that now exists is the entrance hall, the *naub\u00e1t kh\u00e1n\u00e1*, the *diw\u00e1n-i-\u00e1m*, *diw\u00e1n-i-kh\u00e1s*, and the *rang mah\u00e1l*\u2014now used as a mess-room\u2014and one or two small pavilions. These are the gems of the palace, it is true; but without the courts and corridors connecting them they lose all their meaning, and more than half their beauty. Being now situated in the middle of a British barrack-yard, they look like precious stones torn from their setting in some exquisite piece of oriental jeweller's work and set at random in a bed of the commonest plaster.'\n\nThe buildings in the native town are chiefly of brick, well-built and substantial. The smaller streets are narrow and tortuous, and in many cases end in *culs-de-sac*. On the other hand, no city in India has finer streets than the main thoroughfares of Delhi, ten in number, thoroughly drained, metalled, and lighted. The principal thoroughfare, the Ch\u00e1ndni Chauk, or Silver Street, leads eastwards from the fort to the Lahore gate, three-quarters of a mile long by 74 feet broad. Throughout the greater part of its length, a double row of *nim* and *pipal* trees runs down its centre on both sides of a raised path, which has taken the place of the masonry aqueduct that in former days conducted water from the canal into the palace. A little to the south of the Ch\u00e1ndni Chauk is the Jam\u00e1 Masj\u00edd, or great mosque, standing out boldly from a small rocky rising ground. Begun by Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n in the fourth year of his reign, and completed in the tenth, it still remains one of the finest buildings of its kind in India. The front courtyard, 450 feet square, surrounded by a cloister open on both sides, is paved with granite inlaid with\nmarble, and commands a view of the whole city. The mosque itself, a splendid structure forming an oblong 261 feet in length, is approached by a magnificent flight of stone steps. Three domes of white marble rise from its roof, with two tall and graceful minarets at the corners in front. The interior of the mosque is paved throughout with white marble, and the walls and roof are lined with the same material. Two other mosques in Delhi deserve a passing notice,\u2014the K\u00e1l\u00e1 Masjid, or black mosque, so called from the dark colour given to it by time, and supposed to have been built by one of the early Afgh\u00e1n sovereigns; and the mosque of Roshan-ud-daul\u00e1. Among the more modern buildings of Delhi may be mentioned the Government College, founded in 1792, but recently abolished; the Residency; and the Protestant church, built at a cost of \u00a310,000 by Colonel Skinner, an officer well known in the history of the East India Company. About half-way down the Ch\u00e1ndni Chauk is a high clock-tower, with the Institute and Museum opposite. Behind the Ch\u00e1ndni Chauk, to the north, lie the Queen's Gardens; beyond them the 'city lines' stretch away as far as the historic 'ridge,' about a mile outside the town. From the summit of this ridge the view of the station and city is very picturesque. To the west and north-west, considerable suburbs cluster beyond the walls, containing the tombs of the imperial family. That of Hum\u00e1yun, the second of the Mughal dynasty, is a noble building of granite inlaid with marble. It lies about 2 miles from the city, amid a large garden of terraces and fountains, the whole surrounded by an embattled wall, with towers and four gateways. In the centre stands a platform about 20 feet high by 200 feet square, supported by cloisters, and ascended by four great flights of granite steps. Above rises the Mausoleum, also a square, with a great dome of while marble in the centre. About a mile to the westward is another burying-ground, or collection of tombs and small mosques, some of them very beautiful. The most remarkable is perhaps the little chapel in honour of a celebrated Musalm\u00e1n saint, Niz\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn, near whose shrine the members of the late imperial family, up to the time of the Mutiny, lie buried, each in his own little enclosure, surrounded by very elegant lattice-work of white marble. Other buildings, ruins, and pillars will be described under the next section, History. The Kutab Min\u00e1r is situated about 10 miles to the south of the city. (See p. 191.)\n\nThe palaces of the nobles, which formerly gave an air of grandeur to the city, have for the most part disappeared. Their sites are occupied by structures of less pretension, but still with some elegance of architectural design. The city is now amply supplied with water; and much attention has of late been paid to cleanliness and sanitary requirements generally. The principal local institution was, until 1877, the Delhi College, founded in 1792. It was at first exclusively an oriental\nschool, supported by the voluntary contributions of Muhammadan gentlemen, and managed by a committee of the subscribers. In 1829, an English Department was added to it; and in 1855, the institution was placed under the control of the Educational Department. The old college attained to great celebrity as an educational institution, and produced many excellent scholars. In the Mutiny of 1857, it was plundered of a very valuable oriental library, and the building completely destroyed. A new college was founded in 1858, and affiliated to the University of Calcutta in 1864. Under orders of the Government of the Punjab (February 1877), the collegiate staff of teachers have been withdrawn, in order to concentrate the grant available for higher-class education upon the central institution at Lahore, the capital of the Punjab Province.\n\nHistory.\u2014Delhi stands upon a site which has been occupied by many successive capitals since the first Aryan immigration into the valley of the Jumna. Its modern aspect is thus described by Bishop Heber: \u2018A very awful scene of desolation, ruins after ruins, tombs after tombs, fragments of brickwork, freestone, granite, and marble, scattered everywhere over a soil naturally rocky and barren, without cultivation, except in one or two small spots, and without a single tree.\u2019 The waste of ruins extends from the southern end of the present city of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d to the deserted forts of Rai Pithora and Tughlak\u00e1b\u00e1d, a distance of 10 miles. The area covered with these vestiges of successive empires cover an area of 45 square miles. The village and fort of Indrapat or Pur\u00e1na Kil\u00e1, 2 miles south of the existing walls, mark the spot where the earliest P\u00e1ndava colonists placed their city of Indrapr\u00e1sth\u00e1 (see DELHI DISTRICT); but the name of Dilli or Dillipur only makes its appearance in the middle of the 1st century B.C. General Cunningham, following the authority of Ferishta, attributes the foundation of this original Delhi, 5 miles lower down the river than its modern representative, to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Dilu, apparently the last ruler of the Mayura dynasty, whom tradition names as successors to the Gautama line of Indrapr\u00e1sth\u00e1. But the earliest authentic information which we obtain with regard to the city is derived from the famous iron pillar of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Dh\u00e1va, set up in the 3rd or 4th century A.D. This remarkable relic consists of a solid shaft of metal, 16 inches in diameter and about 50 feet in length, so firmly planted in the earth that less than half its height appears above the ground. A Sanskrit inscription, deeply cut on its western face, records the story of its origin. Mr. James Prinsep, the first decipherer of the legend, found that it commemorated the prowess of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Dh\u00e1va, who \u2018obtained with his own arm an undivided sovereignty on the earth for a long period;\u2019 while the letters appear to be \u2018the typical cuts inflicted on his enemies by his sword, writing his immortal fame.\u2019 General Cunningham suggests the year 319 A.D. as an\napproximation to the date, on the ground that the R\u00e1j\u00e1 may probably have contributed to the downfall of the great Gupta dynasty (see Kanauj), which is supposed to have occurred in that year. Tradition, however, running counter to the unimpeachable authority of the inscription, refers the erection of the pillar to Anang P\u00e1l, founder of the T\u00faar, Tunwar, or Tomar dynasty in the 8th century A.D. A holy Br\u00e1hman assured the R\u00e1j\u00e1 that the pillar had been driven so deeply into the earth, that it reached the head of Vasuki, the serpent king, who supports the world; and, consequently, had become immovable, whereby the dominion was ensured for ever to the dynasty of its founder, so long as the pillar stood. The incredulous R\u00e1j\u00e1 ordered the monument to be dug up, when its base was found reddened with the blood of the serpent king. Thus convinced, Anang P\u00e1l at once commanded that the shaft should be sunk again in the earth; but, as a punishment for his want of faith, it appeared that no force could restore it in its place as before. Hence the city derived its name of Dhili, from the fact that the column remained loose (dhila) in the ground! Unfortunately for the legend, not only does the inscription prove its falsity, but the name of Dilli is undoubtedly earlier than the rise of the T\u00faar dynasty. Anang P\u00e1l, whose accession is placed by General Cunningham in the year 736 A.D., restored Delhi, which had fallen into ruins for some generations, and made it the capital of his race. The later R\u00e1j\u00e1s, however, appear to have taken up their residence at Kanauj, whence they were expelled about the middle of the 11th century by Chandra Deva, the first of the Rahtor kings. Anang P\u00e1l II. then retired to Delhi, which became once more the T\u00faar metropolis. He rebuilt and adorned the city, surrounding it with a massive line of fortifications, whose ruins are still believed to exist in the great circle of masonry lying around the Kutab Min\u00e1r. The date of this restoration has been preserved for us by a second inscription, cut into the more ancient pillar of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Dh\u00e1va: \u2018In Sambat 1109\u2019 [1052 A.D.], \u2018Anang P\u00e1l peopled Dilli.\u2019 Just a century later, under the reign of a third Anang P\u00e1l, last of the T\u00faar line, Delhi fell (1154) before Visaldeva or B\u00edsaldeo, Chauh\u00e1n ruler of Ajmere. The conqueror permitted the vanquished R\u00e1j\u00e1 to retain possession as a vassal; and from a marriage between the two houses sprang the celebrated Prithvi R\u00e1j\u00e1, the last champion of Hindu independence in Upper India, who thus succeeded to the joint realms of the T\u00faars and the Chauh\u00e1ns. Prithvi R\u00e1j\u00e1 further strengthened the defences of the city by the erection of the fort called Rai Pithora, and by building an exterior wall, which ran round the fortifications of Anang P\u00e1l, and of which remains may still be traced for a considerable distance. At this point the history of Hindu Delhi ends. In 1191, Sh\u00e1hab-ud-d\u00edn, better known as Muhammad of Ghor, made his first invasion of Upper India, bringing the religion of the\nProphet and authentic history in his train. Prithvi R\u00e1j\u00e1 successfully defended his kingdom for a time; Muhammad was routed at Thanesar, and his horde pursued for forty miles; but two years later, the Muhammadan marauders returned, utterly overthrew the Hindus in a great battle, and put their prince to death in cold blood.\n\nKutab-ud-d\u00edn, the Sult\u00e1n\u2019s Viceroy, attacked and took Delhi, which became thenceforth the Musalm\u00e1n capital. On the death of Sh\u00e1hab-ud-d\u00edn, in 1206, the Viceroy proclaimed himself an independent sovereign, and became the founder of the Slave dynasty, to whom Old Delhi owes most of its grandest ruins. Kutab-ud-d\u00edn\u2019s mosque was commenced, according to the inscription on its entrance archway, immediately after the capture of the city in 1193. It was completed in three years, and enlarged during the reign of Altamsh, son-in-law of the founder, and the greatest monarch of the line. This mosque consists of an outer and inner courtyard, the latter surrounded by an exquisite colonnade, whose richly-decorated shafts have been torn from the precincts of earlier Hindu temples. Originally a thick coat of plaster concealed from the believers\u2019 eyes the profuse idolatrous ornamentations; but the stucco has now fallen away, revealing the delicate workmanship of the Hindu artists in all its pristine wealth. Eleven magnificent arches close its western fa\u00e7ade, Muhammadan in outline and design, but carried out in detail by Hindu workmen, as the intricate lacework which covers every portion of the arcade sufficiently bears witness. Ibn Batuta, the Moorish traveller, who was a magistrate in Delhi, and saw the mosque about 150 years after its erection, describes it as unequalled either for beauty or extent. The Kutab Min\u00e1r, another celebrated monument of the great Slave king, stands in the south-east corner of the outer courtyard of the mosque. It rises to a height of 238 feet, tapering gracefully from a diameter of 47 feet at the base to nearly 9 feet at the summit. The shaft consists of 5 storeys, enclosing a spiral staircase, and is crowned by a now broken cupola, which fell during an earthquake in 1803. The original purpose of the minaret was doubtless as a Muazzam\u2019s tower, whence the call to morning and evening prayer might be heard throughout the whole city. The site chosen for the mosque was that already occupied by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Dh\u00e1va\u2019s pillar, which forms the centre ornament of the inner courtyard. Around, in every direction, spreads a heap of splendid ruins, the most striking of which is the unfinished minaret of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, commenced in 1311.\n\nDuring the reign of the Slave kings, a queen, for the first and last time in the history of Muhammadan Delhi, sat on the throne of the empire. As the patriot Hungarians, in the annals of modern Europe, drew their swords for Rex Maria Theresa, so her admiring subjects gave to Queen Raziy\u00e1 the masculine title of Sult\u00e1n. The Slave dynasty retained the sovereignty till 1290, when Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn, the\nKhilji, founded a new line. During the reign of his nephew and successor, Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, Delhi was twice unsuccessfully attacked by Mughal hordes, who swept into the country from Central Asia.\n\nIn 1321, the house of Tughlak succeeded to the Musalm\u00e1n Empire; and Ghiy\u00e1s-ud-d\u00edn, its founder, erected a new capital, Tughlak\u00e1b\u00e1d, on a rocky eminence 4 miles farther to the east. Remains of a massive citadel, and deserted streets or lanes, still mark the spot on which this third metropolis arose; but no human inhabitants now frequent the vast and desolate ruins. Ghiy\u00e1s-ud-d\u00edn died in 1325, and was succeeded by his son Muhammad Tughlak, who thrice attempted to remove the seat of government and the whole population from Delhi to Daulatabad (Deogiri) in the Deccan\u2014more than 800 miles away. Ibn Batuta, a native of Tangiers, who visited his court in 1341, gives a graphic picture of the desolate city, with its magnificent architectural works, and its bare, unpeopled houses. Firoz Sh\u00e1h Tughlak once more removed the site of Delhi to a new town, Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d, which appears to have occupied the ground between the tomb of Hum\u00e1yun and the Ridge. Amid the ruins of this prince\u2019s palace, just outside the modern south gate, stands one of the famous pillars originally erected by Asoka, the great Buddhist Emperor, in the 3rd century B.C. This monolith, 42 feet in height, known as Firoz Sh\u00e1h\u2019s l\u00e1t or pillar, is composed of pale pink sandstone, and contains a P\u00e1li inscription, deciphered by the painstaking scholarship and ingenuity of Mr. James Prinsep. Its connection with Delhi, however, does not date further back than the reign of Firoz Sh\u00e1h, who brought it from near Khizr\u00e1b\u00e1d on the upper waters of the Jumna, and fixed it on the summit of his comparatively modern building.\n\nIn December 1398, during the reign of Muhammad Tughlak, the hordes of Tim\u00far reached Delhi. The king fled to Gujar\u00e1t, the army suffered a defeat beneath the walls, and Tim\u00far, entering the city, gave it over for five days to plunder and massacre. Dead bodies choked the streets; and when at last even the Mughal appetite for carnage was satiated, the host retired dragging with them into slavery large numbers both of men and women. For two months Delhi remained absolutely without a show of government; until Muhammad Tughlak recovered a miserable fragment of his former empire. In 1412 he died; and his successors, the Sayyid dynasty, held Delhi with a petty principality in the neighbourhood until 1444. The Lod\u00ed family, who succeeded to the Musalm\u00e1n Empire in that year, appear to have deserted Delhi, fixing their residence and the seat of government at Agra. In 1526, B\u00e1bar, the sixth in descent from Tim\u00far, and founder of the so-called Mughal dynasty, marched into India with a small but disciplined force; and having overthrown Ibr\u00e1him Lod\u00ed, the last dynastic Afgh\u00e1n prince, on the decisive field of Panipat, advanced upon Delhi, which he entered\nin May of the same year. The new sovereign, however, resided mainly at Agra, where he died in 1530. His son Hum\u00e1yun removed to Delhi, and built or restored the fort of Pur\u00e1na Kila on the site of Indrapr\u00e1sth\u00e1. The Afgh\u00e1n Sher Sh\u00e1h, who drove out Hum\u00e1yun in 1549, enclosed and fortified the city with a new wall. One of his approaches, known as the L\u00e1l Darw\u00e1za or Red Gate, still stands isolated on the roadside, facing the modern jail. The fortress of Sal\u00edmgarh, already mentioned, preserves the name of a son of Sher Sh\u00e1h. In 1555, Hum\u00e1yun regained his throne, but died within six months of his restoration. His tomb forms one of the most striking architectural monuments in the neighbourhood. Akbar and Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr usually resided at Agra, Lahore, or Ajmere (Ajm\u00edr); and Delhi again languished in disfavour till the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. This magnificent Emperor rebuilt the city in its present form, surrounding it with the existing fortifications, and adding the title of Shahjah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d from his own name. He also built the Jam\u00e1 Masjid, and reopened the Western Jumna Canal. Under the reign of Aurangzeb, Delhi was the seat of that profuse and splendid court whose glories were narrated to Europe in extravagant fables by travellers and missionaries.\n\nAfter the death of Aurangzeb, the Mughal Empire fell rapidly to pieces; but the numerous palace intrigues and revolutions amid which it broke up, belong to the general domain of Indian history. In 1726, during the reign of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s first appeared beneath the walls of Delhi. Three years later, N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h entered the city in triumph, and re-enacted the massacre of Tim\u00far. For fifty-eight days the victorious Persian plundered rich and poor alike; when the last farthing had been exacted, he left the city with a booty estimated at \u00a39,000,000. Before the final disruption of the decaying empire in 1760, the unhappy capital was devastated by a civil war carried on for six months in its streets; twice sacked by Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni; and finally spoiled by the rapacious Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Alamg\u00edr II., the last real Emperor, was murdered in 1760. Sh\u00e1h Alam, who assumed the empty title, could not establish his authority in Delhi, which became the alternate prey of Afgh\u00e1n and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s until 1771, when the latter party restored the phantom Emperor to the city of his ancestors. In 1788, a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 garrison permanently occupied the palace, and the king remained a prisoner in the hands of Sindhia until the British conquest. On March 14th, 1803, Lord Lake, having defeated the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, entered Delhi, and took the king under his protection. Next year, Holkar attacked the city; but Colonel, afterwards Sir David, Ochterlony, the first British Resident, successfully held out against overwhelming numbers for eight days, until relieved by Lord Lake. The conquered territory was administered by the British in the name of the Emperor (see DELHI DISTRICT), while the palace remained under His Majesty's jurisdiction.\nFor more than half a century Delhi was happy in entire freedom from the incidents of history. But the Mutiny of 1857 once more gave it prominence as the revived capital of the fallen Empire. The outbreak at Meerut took place on the evening of May 10th; and early next morning the mutinous troopers had crossed the Jumna, and clamoured for admission beneath the Delhi wall. The Commandant of the Guards, the Commissioner, and the Collector retired to the Lahore gate of the palace, and were there cut to pieces. Most of the European residents then had their homes within the city. The mutineers and the mob fell upon them at once, carrying murder and plunder into every house. The mutinous infantry from Meerut arrived; and by eight o'clock the rebels held the whole city, except the magazine and the main-guard. News of these events soon reached the cantonment beyond the Ridge, where three battalions of Native infantry and a battery of Native artillery were stationed. The 54th N.I. was marched promptly down to the main-guard, but proved mutinous on their arrival, and cut down several of their officers. Portions of two regiments, however, together with the artillery, remained all day under arms in the main-guard, and were reinforced from time to time by the few fugitives who succeeded in escaping from the city. The magazine stood half-way between the palace and the main-guard; and here Lieutenant Willoughby, with eight other Europeans, held out bravely for some time, determined to defend the immense store of munitions collected within; but about mid-day defence became hopeless, and the nine brave men blew up the magazine behind them. Five perished in the explosion; two reached the main-guard; while the remaining two escaped by a different road to Meerut. All day long the Sepoys in the cantonment and the main-guard were restrained by the expected arrival of white regiments from Meerut; but as evening drew on, and no European troops appeared, they openly threw off their allegiance, and began an indiscriminate massacre of the officers, women, and children. A few escaped along the roads to Meerut or Karn\u00e1l, but most even of these were murdered or perished of hunger on the way. By nightfall, every vestige of British authority had disappeared alike in the cantonments and in the city. Meanwhile, in Delhi, some fifty Christians, European or Eurasian, mostly women and children, had been thrust indiscriminately into a room of the palace, and, after sixteen days' confinement, were massacred in the courtyard.\n\nThe restoration of Mughal sovereignty, and the acts by which it was accompanied, belong rather to Imperial than local history. The Court of the rebel Emperor did not long enjoy its independence. On June 8th, 1857, the British forces fought the battle of Badli-ka-Sarai, and the same evening swept the mutineers from the cantonments, and encamped upon the rocky ridge outside the city. For three months\nthe siege proceeded under the most disadvantageous conditions, and at length, on September 8th, the heavy batteries were got into action, and an assault was prepared. On the 14th, our troops advanced to storm the gates, in the face of an overwhelming rebel garrison, and, in spite of serious losses and heavy fighting, succeeded by a marvellous display of gallantry in carrying the bastions and occupying the whole eastern quarter of the city. For five days fighting continued in the streets, the rebels retreating from point to point, and every defensible position being occupied by our troops only after a severe struggle. On the night of the 20th, the palace and the remaining portions of the city were evacuated by the mutineers, and Delhi came once more into the possession of the British forces. The king, with several members of his family, took refuge in the tomb of Hum\u00e1yun, and surrendered on the 21st. Tried by a military commission, he was found guilty of encouraging acts of rebellion and murder, but, owing to the terms of his surrender, received no heavier penalty than that of perpetual banishment. He died at Rangoon on October 7th, 1862. Delhi, thus recovered, remained for a while under military government; and it became necessary, owing to the frequent murders of European soldiers, to expel the population for a while from the city. Shortly after, the Hindu inhabitants were freely readmitted; but the Muhammadans were still rigorously excluded, till the restoration of the city to the civil authorities, on January the 11th, 1858. The work of reorganization then continued rapidly during the remainder of that year; and after a few months, the shattered bastions and the ruined walls alone recalled the memory of the Mutiny. Since that date Delhi has settled down into a prosperous commercial town, and a great railway centre. The romance of antiquity still lingers around it, and Delhi was chosen as the scene of the Imperial Proclamation on the 1st of January 1877.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Between the Census of 1868 and the Census of 1881 the population of Delhi City increased by 18,976. In 1853, the number of inhabitants was returned at 152,426. In 1868, the population numbered 154,417, showing an increase of 1991 persons in the fifteen years. Taking into consideration the actual losses during the Mutiny, the expulsion of the Musalm\u00e1ns after its suppression, and the large number of persons thrown out of employment by the removal of the court, the fact that such an increase should have taken place bears witness to the renewed prosperity of the city. According to the Census of February 17th, 1881, the population numbered 173,393, inclusive of those dwelling in the cantonments, civil lines, and suburbs. The total was composed of 93,165 males and 80,228 females. The Hindus numbered 95,484, being 52,467 males and 43,017 females; the Muhammadans, 72,519, being 37,329 males and 35,190 females.\nThere were also 856 Sikhs, 2676 Jains, and 858 'others.' In 1876, the population of Delhi and its suburbs was returned at 160,553.\n\nInstitutions, Public Buildings, etc.\u2014The Delhi Institute, a handsome building in the Ch\u00e1ndni Chauk, erected by public subscription, with the assistance of a Government grant, contains a Darb\u00e1r Hall, a museum, a library and reading-room, and the lecture theatre and ball-room of the station. The municipal committee and the honorary magistrates hold their sittings in the Darb\u00e1r Hall. The official buildings include the District court offices and treasury, just within the Kashmir gate, the tahs\u00edl and police offices, the District jail, the lunatic asylum, the hospital, and a dispensary, with two branches. The poor-house is supported by private subscription, supplemented by a grant from the municipal funds. Four churches exist in Delhi, the Station Church, the Roman Catholic and Presbyterian chapels, and a chapel belonging to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. The Delhi College, founded in 1792, and supported by the voluntary contributions of Muhammadan gentlemen, acquired a large accession of income in 1829, from the gift of \u00a317,000 by Naw\u00e1b Fazl Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n of Lucknow. In 1855, the Educational Department undertook the management. During the Mutiny, the valuable oriental library was plundered, and the building destroyed. A new institution, founded in 1858, was affiliated to the Calcutta University in 1864, and, till lately, educated up to the level of its degrees. In 1883 there were 13 printing-presses at work in the city.\n\nCommunications, Trade, etc.\u2014The East Indian Railway enters Delhi by an iron bridge over the Jumna, from Gh\u00e1zi\u00e1b\u00e1d Junction in Meerut District. The Punjab Railway also runs its trains over the same branch line. The terminus stands in the city, near the fort. The R\u00e1jput\u00e1na State Railway, running to Ajmere, has its station adjoining that of the other lines. The Grand Trunk Road and other metalled highways lead to all important centres, and the Jumna carries a large portion of the heavy traffic. Delhi possesses a very considerable trade, though the continuation of the great north-western trunk railway on the eastern bank of the river has thrown it somewhat off the modern line of traffic. It still forms, however, the main entrep\u00f4t for commerce between Calcutta or Bombay on the one side, and R\u00e1jput\u00e1na on the other. The chief imports include indigo, chemicals, cotton, silk, fibres, grain, oil-seeds, gh\u00ed, metals, salt, horns, hides, and European piece-goods. The exports consist of the same articles in transit, together with tobacco, sugar, oil, jewellery, and gold or silver lacework. Beyond the borders of the Province, Delhi merchants correspond with those of J\u00ednd, K\u00e1b\u00fal, Alwar, Bikaner (Bickaneer), Jaipur (Jeypore), and the Do\u00e1b; while with all the Punjab towns they have extensive dealings. The Bengal and Delhi banks represent European finance, and several\ncotton merchants have agents in the city. The great trade avenue of the Ch\u00e1ndni Chauk, already described, is lined with the shops and warehouses of merchants, and is one of the chief sights of interest to the visitor at Delhi. The only manufacture of importance consists of gold, silver, or tinsel filigree work, for which Delhi has long been famous; but the imitation of European models is unfortunately destroying its originality and beauty. The abolition of the Mughal court has also acted prejudicially to this branch of industry. The manufacture of fine muslin is peculiar to Delhi among the Punjab towns, and glazed work, carved work, and shawl-weaving are also carried on. Jewellers and dealers in precious stones throng the Ch\u00e1ndni Chauk, and have agents in every European settlement of any importance in Upper India. The internal affairs of the city are managed by a first-class municipality. The municipal income in 1881\u201382 amounted to \u00a327,656; municipal expenditure, \u00a325,590. In 1882\u201383, the registration returns of Delhi show an import trade valued at \u00a34,342,500, and an export trade valued at \u00a32,665,000.\n\n**Delly.**\u2014Hill in the Chirakkal taluk, Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency. The correct name is D\u2019Ely (Monte d\u2019Ely of the Portuguese), representing the name of the ancient Malab\u00e1r State of Eli or Hely, belonging to the Kolattiri R\u00e1j\u00e1s, one of whose seats is close to this hill on the south-east. Lat. 12\u00b0 2' N., long. 75\u00b0 14' E.; height, 800 feet above the sea. Situated on the coast, with creeks on either side, which, joining, make it an island. The fortifications, now in ruins, have been occupied at different periods by Dutch, French, and British troops. Delly is a station of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, and a prominent landmark for mariners, being visible in fine weather at 27 miles\u2019 distance. The jungle covering the hill and surrounding the base affords cover to large game, sambhar, leopards, etc., and is a favourite resort of sportsmen. A project set on foot for the construction of a harbour off this headland was abandoned on account of the enormous expense attending it. Mount Delly was the first Indian land seen by Vasco da Gama.\n\n**Dem\u00e1giri.**\u2014Falls on the Karnaphuli river, in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bengal. They are situated about three days\u2019 journey from Barkal, where the Karnaphuli leaves the higher ranges of hills in the District. Above the falls the river is an insignificant stream. A b\u00e1z\u00e1r or market for india-rubber and other jungle produce opened at the village of Dem\u00e1giri in 1872, has now (1883) become a flourishing mart.\n\n**Denaikankotai** *(Denkanikota).*\u2014Town in Os\u00far taluk, Salem District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 12\u00b0 31' 45\" N., long. 77\u00b0 49' 50\" E.; elevation above sea-level about 3000 feet; population (1881) 3899; houses, 915. Situated 9.4 miles north of Salem, 16 miles south of\nOs\u00far town, and 10 miles east of Thalli. The head-quarters of the deputy tahsild\u00e1r, the forest overseer, and inspector of police. Up to 1859, Denaikankotai, the upland division of Os\u00far, formed a separate taluk, now incorporated with Os\u00far. It was ceded with the Bara Mah\u00e1l to the British in 1792. The town is well laid out on the side of a hill, up which the principal streets trend. The water-supply is good. Fever is very prevalent. Trade in grain; a former silk industry has died out.\n\nDenwa.\u2014River in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Central Provinces, running in a rough semicircle round the scarped cliffs on the eastern and northern faces of the Mah\u00e1deo chain. Rising in lat. $22^\\circ 20'$ N., and long. $78^\\circ 27' 30\"$ E., it winds through a deep glen into a small valley shut off from the main Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) valley by an irregular line of low hills, and entering the hills again towards the west, it meets the T\u00e1wa (lat. $22^\\circ 34'$ N., long. $78^\\circ 0' 30\"$ E.) a few miles above B\u00e1gr\u00e1.\n\nDenwa.\u2014Forest in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Central Provinces, covering a level tract of about 100 square miles along the valley of the Denwa river. Abounds in fine s\u00e1l wood.\n\nDeo.\u2014Town in Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d Sub-division, Gay\u00e1 District, Bengal. Lat. $24^\\circ 39' 30\"$ N., long. $84^\\circ 28' 38\"$ E. Seat of the Deo R\u00e1j\u00e1s, one of the most ancient families of Behar, who trace their descent from the R\u00e1n\u00e1s of Udaipur (Oodeypore). In the struggle between Warren Hastings and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Benares, the Deo R\u00e1j\u00e1, although too old to take the field in person, joined his forces to those of the British. His next successor mustered a loyal contingent against the mutineers at Sarguj\u00e1. His son, in turn, rendered good service to us in quelling the Kol insurrection. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 stood boldly forward for the British during the Mutiny of 1857. Four generations of unswerving loyalty have been rewarded by liberal grants of land and villages; and the chief in 1877 received the title of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Bah\u00e1dur, with a Knight Commandership of the Star of India, for his services in 1857. Seat of an old ruined fort and famous temple, at which thousands of people congregate twice a year to hold the Chhat festival in honour of the Sun-god.\n\nDeoband.\u2014Southern tahsil of Sah\u00e1ranpur District, North-Western Provinces, consisting of a level agricultural plain, traversed by the Eastern Jumna (Jamun\u00e1) Canal, and by the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway. Area 387 square miles, of which 309 are cultivated; population (1881) 180,991; land revenue, \u00a330,160; total Government revenue, \u00a333,344; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a338,522; incidence of Government land revenue, 3s. per cultivated acre. The tahsil contains 1 civil and 1 criminal court, with 5 th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles; strength of regular police, 59 men, with 418 village watchmen.\n\nDeoband.\u2014Town and municipality in Sah\u00e1ranpur District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Deoband tahsil. Area, 245\nacres. Population (1881) 22,116, namely, 9325 Hindus, 12,457 Muhammadans, 332 Jains, and 2 'others.' Situated in lat. 29\u00b0 41' 50\" N., and long. 77\u00b0 43' 10\" E., about 2\u00bd miles to the west of the East K\u00e1li N\u00e1di, with which it was formerly connected by a waterway known as the Jor. Half a mile from the town, the Jor expands into a small lake, the Devi-k\u00fand, whose banks are covered with temples, gh\u00e1ts, and sati monuments, much frequented by devout pilgrims. The town has 4 b\u00e1zars, 3 of which are prosperous and clean. The dominant Musalm\u00e1n population maintain no less than 42 mosques. Yet Deoband is essentially a town of Hindu origin, with a legendary history of 3000 years. The P\u00e1ndavas passed their first exile within its precincts, and the fortress was one of the earliest to fall before the famous Musalm\u00e1n saint, S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1\u00fad Gh\u00e1z\u00ed. The town originally bore the name of Deviban or the Sacred Grove, and a religious assembly still takes place yearly in a neighbouring wood, which contains a temple of Devi. During the Mutiny several disturbances occurred, but they were repressed without serious difficulty. Export trade in grain, refined sugar, and oil; manufacture of fine cloth. Dispensary, Anglo-vernacular school, police station, post-office, tahs\u00edl. Distant from Muzaffarnagar 15\u00bd miles north.

One of the three or four places in the District where the smelting of iron was formerly carried on. The works, however, have now been stopped, owing to their unremunerative results. The characteristics of the B\u00edrbh\u00fam metal are toughness and malleability.\n\nDeodangar (or Deodonga).\u2014Mountain peak in Parla Kimedi estate, Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency; situated in lat. 18\u00b0 54' 35\" N., and long. 84\u00b0 6' 2\" E., 20 miles south-west from Mahendragiri, and 9 from Namanagaram.

Estimated area, 440 square miles; population (1881) 24,061, principally R\u00e1jputs and Kol\u00eds; number of villages, 66; number of houses, 4651; estimated gross revenue, \u00a32500. The country consists of a flat, open plain, covered with low brushwood. The soil is generally sandy, producing but one crop yearly, and that only of the common sorts of grain. There are no rivers, but numerous ponds and reservoirs, which, as a rule, dry up before the end of March. There are no means of irrigation, and the water, found at a depth of from 40 to 60 feet, is brackish. April, May,\nJune, and July are excessively hot; rain falls in August and September; October and November are again warm; while the period from December to March is cold and agreeable. Fever is the prevailing disease. Cholera is not infrequent. Coarse cloth, worn by the poorest classes, is manufactured by men of the Dher caste. There are numerous country tracks fit for carts, but no regular road has yet been made. Clarified butter is the only export, which finds a ready market in the neighbouring Districts. The chief holds the title of Th\u00e1kur, and does not possess a sanad authorizing adoption, nor does the succession follow the rule of primogeniture. No military force is maintained. There is only 1 school with 21 pupils. The first relations between Deodar and the British date from 1819. The State depends on the British Government for external defence, but is allowed complete freedom in the internal management of its revenue affairs. The Chief of Deodar exercises the powers of a third-class magistrate, and civil jurisdiction in suits for sums up to \u00a325 in his territory. The principal town of the State, Deodar, is situated in lat. 24\u00b0 8' 30\" N., and long. 71\u00b0 49' E., 45 miles west of P\u00e1lanpur.\n\nDeog\u00e1on.\u2014Southern tahsil of Azamgarh District, North-Western Provinces, consisting of the three pargan\u00e1s of Deog\u00e1on, Bel\u00e1 Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Bil\u00e1hbans.

It contained, in 1881-82, 3 magisterial and revenue courts, a general police force of 172 men, and a village watch of 794 men.\n\nDeogarh.\u2014Head-quarters town of Deogarh Sub-division, Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s District, Bengal. Lat. 24\u00b0 29' 34\" N., long. 86\u00b0 44' 35\" E., 4 miles east of the Chord line of the East Indian Railway, with which it is connected by a steam tramway. Population (1881) 8005, namely, 7704 Hindus, 297 Muhammadans, and 4 'others;' area of town site, 400 acres. Deogarh is a municipality; revenue (1881-82), \u00a3487; average rate of taxation, 2s. per head of population. The principal object of interest is the group of 22 temples dedicated to Siva, which form a centre of pilgrimage for Hindus from all parts of India. The oldest temple is called Baidyan\u00e1th, and is said to contain one of the twelve oldest lingams of Siva in India. The legend of the temples is told as follows in the Annals of Rural Bengal:\u2014'In the old time, a band of Br\u00e1hmans settled on the banks of the beautiful highland lake beside which the holy city stands. Around them there was nothing but the forest and mountains in which dwelt the black races. The Br\u00e1hmans placed the symbol of their god Siva near the lake, and did sacrifice to it; but the black tribes would not sacrifice to it, but came as before to the three great stones which their fathers had worshipped, and which are to be seen at the western entrance of Deogarh to this day. The Br\u00e1hmans, moreover, ploughed the land, and brought water from the lake to nourish the soil; but the hillmen hunted and fished as of old, while their women tilled little patches of Indian corn. But in process of time, the Br\u00e1hmans, finding the land good, became slothful, giving themselves up to lust, and seldom calling on their god Siva. This the black tribes, who came to worship the great stones, saw and wondered at more and more, till at last, one of them, by name Baiju, a man of a mighty arm, and rich in all sorts of cattle, became wroth at the lies and wantonness of the Br\u00e1hmans, and vowed he would beat the symbol of their god Siva with his club every day before touching food. This he did; but one morning his cows strayed into the forest, and after seeking them all day, he came home hungry and weary, and having hastily bathed in the lake, sat down to supper. Just as he stretched out his hand to take the food, he called to mind his vow, and worn out as he was, he got up, limped painfully to the Br\u00e1hmans' idol on the margin of the lake, and beat it with his club. Then suddenly a splendid form, sparkling with jewels, rose from the waters and said: \"Behold the man who forgets his hunger and his weariness to beat me, while my priests sleep with their concubines at home, and neither give me to eat nor to drink. Let him ask of me what he will, and it shall be given.\" Baiju answered, \"I am\nstrong of arm and rich in cattle. I am a leader of my people; what want I more? Thou art called N\u0101th (Lord); let me, too, be called Lord, and let my temple go by my name.\" \"Amen,\" replied the deity; \"henceforth thou art not Baiju, but Baijn\u0101th, and my temple shall be called by thy name.\"\n\n'From that day the place rose into note; merchants, R\u00e1j\u00e1s, and Br\u00e1hmans commenced building temples, each vying with the other who would build the handsomest temple near the spot where Mah\u00e1deo had appeared to Baiju. The fame of the spot, its sanctity, all became noised abroad throughout the country, until it gradually became a place of pilgrimage\u2014at present, beset by a band of harpies in the shape of Br\u00e1hmans, who remorselessly fleece all the poorer pilgrims, beg of the rich with much importunity, and lead the most dissolute and abandoned lives.\n\n'The group of temples are surrounded by a high wall enclosing an extensive courtyard, paved with Chun\u00e1r freestone; this pavement, the offering of a rich M\u00edrz\u00e1pur merchant, cost a l\u00e1kh of rupees, and serves to keep the courtyard in a state of cleanliness that could not otherwise be the case. All the temples but three are dedicated to Siva in his form of Mah\u00e1deo; the remaining three are dedicated to his wife Parbat\u00ed. The male and female temples are connected from the summits with silken ropes, 40 and 50 yards in length, from which depend gaudily-coloured cloths, wreaths, and garlands of flowers and tinsel. At the western entrance to Deogarh town is a masonry platform, about 6 feet in height and 20 feet square, supporting three huge monoliths of contorted gneiss; two are vertical, and the third is laid upon the heads of the two uprights as a horizontal beam. These massive stones are 12 feet in length, quadrilateral in form, and each weighing upwards of 7 tons. By whom, or when, these ponderous stones were erected, no one knows. There is a faint attempt at sculpture at each end of the vertical faces of the horizontal beam, representing either elephants' or crocodiles' heads. A few ruins, like those of ancient Buddhist vih\u0101ras, stand near the monolithic group.'\n\nDeogarh.\u2014Sub-division of Ratn\u00e1giri District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Devgadh, sub-division.\n\nDeogarh.\u2014Seaport in Ratn\u00e1giri District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Devgadh, town.\n\nDeogarh.\u2014Village in Chhindw\u00e1ra District, Central Provinces; picturesquely situated among the hills, about 24 miles south-west of Chhindw\u00e1ra town. Ancient seat of the midland Gond kingdom. Though now containing only 50 or 60 houses, the traces of foundations in the surrounding jungle, and the numerous remains of wells and tanks, show that the former city must have covered a large area. Deogarh contains several old temples, and on a high peak outside the\nvillage stands a ruined stone fort. All the buildings are constructed of the finest limestone.\n\n**Deohr\u00e1.**\u2014Village in Jubal State, Punjab.\u2014See Deorha.\n\n**Deol\u00e1li (Devl\u00e1li).**\u2014Cantonment in the N\u00e1sik Sub-division, N\u00e1sik District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. $19^\\circ 56' 20''$ N., and long. $73^\\circ 51' 30''$ E. Population (1881) 2150, among whom are several families of Deshmukhs, who in former times, as head-men in their villages, had great influence over the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s of the District. The village is about 4 miles south-east of N\u00e1sik, off the Puna (Poona) road, and has a station, known as N\u00e1sik Road, on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. During the dry weather months the village is the gathering-place of numerous grain brokers from Bombay. The cantonment is situated about $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles to the south-west. The barracks afford accommodation for 5000 men, and are in continuous occupation during the trooping season, as nearly all drafts are halted here after disembarkation at Bombay, before proceeding farther up country, as well as drafts on their way to England. The situation is healthy, the water good, and the views of the distant ranges of hills remarkably fine. When the barracks are not required for the troops, they have of late years been occupied by the European children of Byculla schools from Bombay, in the rainy season. Post and telegraph offices.\n\n**Deoli.**\u2014Cantonment in Ajmere-Merw\u00e1ra District, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Lat. $25^\\circ 46'$ N., long. $75^\\circ 25'$ E. Height, 1122 feet above sea-level. Estimated population (1881) 2266. Deoli is situated on an open plain, 57 miles south-east of Nasir\u00e1b\u00e1d (Nusseer\u00e1b\u00e1d). The station was laid out by Major Thom, commanding the late Kotah contingent. Lines exist for a regiment of native infantry and a squadron of native cavalry. The station is garrisoned by the Deoli Irregular Force. It is situated on the triple boundary of Ajmere, Jaipur, and Merw\u00e1ra, and is the head-quarters of the Har\u00e1oti Political Agency. Water-supply good. Post-office, dispensary, mission-house, and school.\n\n**Deol\u00ed.**\u2014Town in Wardh\u00e1 District, Central Provinces, and the third largest cotton mart in the District; 11 miles south-west of Wardh\u00e1 town. Lat. $20^\\circ 39'$ N., long. $78^\\circ 31' 30''$ E. Population (1881) 5126, namely, Hindus, 4597; Muhammadans, 367; Jains, 72; and persons professing aboriginal religions, 90. At the market, held every Friday and Saturday, a brisk traffic is carried on in cattle and agricultural produce. Deol\u00ed has two market-places, one specially set apart for the cotton merchants, in which the ground is covered with loose stones, to preserve the cotton from dirt and white ants; in the centre are two raised platforms, on which the cotton is weighed. The general marketplace consists of rows of raised and masonry-fronted platforms for the tents and stalls of the traders, with metalled roads between, and a fenced-off ground for the cattle trade. A fine broad street runs through\nthe middle of the town, lined on both sides by the shops and houses of the resident merchants. Anglo-vernacular town school, Government garden, sar\u00e1\u00ed with furnished rooms for Europeans, dispensary, and police station, etc.\n\n**Deolia.**\u2014Former capital of Part\u00e1bgarh State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Lat. 24\u00b0 30\u2032 N., long. 74\u00b0 42\u2032 E. It lies 7\u00bd miles due west of Part\u00e1bgarh town, at a height of 1809 feet above sea-level, or 149 feet higher than Part\u00e1bgarh. The site is now almost deserted, and the old palace, originally built by Hari Singh about the middle of the 17th century, is gradually falling to decay. There are several temples still standing, two of which are Jain temples. Among the tanks, the largest is the Teja, which takes its name from Tej Singh, who succeeded his father Bhika Singh, the original founder of Deolia in 1579. Deolia stands on a steep hill detached from the edge of the plateau, its natural strength commanding the country on every side.\n\n**Deonth\u00e1l.**\u2014Village in Simla District, Punjab. Lat. 31\u00b0 1\u2032 N., and long. 77\u00b0 2\u2032 E., on the route from Sub\u00e1thu to Simla, 3\u00bd miles north of the former station; situated in a romantic glen, on the banks of the Gambhar river, with cultivated terraces, artificially cut upon the mountain-sides. Elevation above sea-level, 2200 feet. The village is principally known to the country people for its shrine to a local deity, Deo Bijju, situated on the banks of the Gambhar, close to the iron bridge on the Simla road. The temple enjoys a considerable assignment of revenue-free land.\n\n**Deonth\u00e1l.**\u2014Hill in Hind\u00far State, Punjab. Lat. 31\u00b0 11\u2032 N., long. 76\u00b0 53\u2032 E. A peak of the Mal\u00e1un range, celebrated as the site of a decisive engagement during the G\u00farkha war of 1815. Situated 1\u00bc mile south of Mal\u00e1un, between that fort and Sur\u00e1jgarh, both of which were held by the G\u00farkhas in April 1815, when General Ochterlony advanced to reduce them. A detachment under Colonel Thompson occupied Deonth\u00e1l, and repulsed, with great loss, a body of 2000 G\u00farkhas, who attacked their position. The engagement is known to the country people as the battle of Loh\u00e1rgh\u00e1ti, after the celebrated G\u00farkha leader Bhagia Thapa, who, according to some accounts, charged up to the mouth of a gun, and so sacrificed his life. This fight terminated the war, and the G\u00farkhas soon afterwards gave up the Hill States, which were thereupon restored to their previous holders.\n\n**Deopray\u00e1g.**\u2014Village in Garhw\u00e1l District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 30\u00b0 8\u2032 N., and long. 78\u00b0 39\u2032 E., at the confluence of the Alaknanda and the Bhagirathi rivers; elevation above sea-level, 2266 feet. Below the village the united stream takes the name of the Ganges, and the point of junction forms one of the five sacred halting-places in the pilgrimage which devout Hindus pay to Him\u00e1chal. The village is perched 100 feet above the water's edge, on the scarped side\nof a mountain, which rises behind it to a height of 800 feet. The great temple of R\u00e1ma Chandra, built of massive uncemented stones, stands upon a terrace in the upper part of the town, and consists of an irregular pyramid, capped by a white cupola with a golden ball and spire. The Br\u00e1hmans compute its age at 10,000 years. Religious ablutions take place at two basins, excavated in the rock at the point of junction of the holy streams, one on the Alaknanda, known as Basistkund, and another on the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed, called the Brahmakund. An earthquake in 1803 shattered the temple and other buildings; but the damage was subsequently repaired through the munificence of Daulat R\u00e1o Sindhia. The inhabitants consist chiefly of descendants of Br\u00e1hmans from the Deccan, who have settled here.\n\n**Deora Kot.**\u2014Town in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, Oudh; 16 miles from Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d town, on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. Population (1881), 2256 Hindus and 162 Muhammadans\u2014total, 2418. Temple to Mah\u00e1deo.\n\n**Deorha.**\u2014Village in Jubal State, Punjab, and residence of the R\u00e1n\u00e1, situated in lat. 31\u00b0 6' N., and long. 77\u00b0 44' E., on a tributary of the river P\u00e1bar, in a deep valley, terraced for the careful cultivation of rice and other crops. The R\u00e1n\u00e1\u2019s residence is built in partially Chinese style, the lower portion consisting of masonry, while the upper half is ringed round with wooden galleries capped by overhanging eaves. The palace is remarkable for the enormous masses of *deod\u00e1r* timber used in its construction. Elevation above sea-level, 6550 feet.\n\n**Deor\u00ed (Devar\u00ed).**\u2014Zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri or estate attached to R\u00e1ipur District, Central Provinces; on the west of the Jonk river. Consists of 50 poor and unproductive villages, the principal of which is situated in lat. 21\u00b0 16' 30\" N., and long. 82\u00b0 46' 30\" E. The chief is an aboriginal Binjw\u00e1r, and holds his estate under a very ancient grant. Good teak and *s\u00e1l* forests.\n\n**Deor\u00ed.**\u2014Chief town of a tract of the same name in S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. 23\u00b0 23' N., and long. 79\u00b0 4' E., about 39 miles south of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, on the Narsinghpur road, at an elevation of 1700 feet above sea-level. Population (1881) 7414, namely, Hindus, 5706; Kab\u00edranth\u00eds, 471; Jains, 468; Muhammadans, 663; Christians, 4; and persons following aboriginal religions, 102. Number of houses, 1963. Deor\u00ed is sometimes spoken of as B\u00e1ra Deor\u00ed, and was formerly called R\u00e1mgarh Uj\u00e1rgarh. The present name is derived from a temple still largely resorted to. Weekly market; coarse white cloth is manufactured for export. Deor\u00ed is essentially an agricultural town, the chief trade being in wheat, which is usually procurable here at a cheaper rate than in other parts of the District. The fort, situated to the west of the town, and still in tolerable preservation, must once have been a place of great strength. The\nwalls enclose a space of 3 acres, formerly covered with buildings, but now a complete waste. It was built, as it now stands, about 1713, by Durg\u00e1 Singh, the son of Himmat Singh, the Gond ruler of Gaurjh\u00e1mar, at the traditional cost of a lakh of rupees, and taken from him in 1741 by the troops of the Peshw\u00e1. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the town flourished. In 1767, the Peshw\u00e1 bestowed Deori and the P\u00e1nch Mah\u00e1l, or five tracts attached to it, rent free on Dhonda Datt\u00e1traya, a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 pandit, whose descendant, R\u00e1mchandra R\u00e1o, still held it in 1817. In 1813, Z\u00e1l\u00edm Singh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Garh\u00e1kota, plundered the town, and set it on fire; on which occasion 30,000 persons perished. In 1817, the Peshw\u00e1 ceded S\u00e1g\u00e1r to the British Government, but during the next year the P\u00e1nch Mah\u00e1l, with Deor\u00ed, were made over to Sindhia, R\u00e1mchandra R\u00e1o receiving another estate in compensation. In 1825 they were again transferred by Sindhia to the British Government for management, and were finally made part of British territory by the treaty of 1860. In 1857, soon after the outbreak of the Mutiny, a Gond named Durjan Singh, who owned Singhpur and other villages near Deor\u00ed, seized the fort with a band of rebels; but about a month later he was expelled by Safd\u00e1r Hus\u00e1in, the officer in charge of the Deor\u00ed police. Deor\u00ed has a dispensary, police station, District post-office, and 3 schools\u20142 for boys and 1 for girls.\n\n**Deoria.**\u2014Southern tahsil of Gorakhpur District, North-Western Provinces; consisting of an almost unbroken plain, co-extensive and identical with its single pargan\u00e1 Salimpur. Area, 587 square miles, of which 442 are cultivated; population (1881) 481,445; land revenue, \u00a329,686; total Government revenue, \u00a333,266; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a381,447; incidence of Government revenue, 2s. 4d. per cultivated acre. In general fertility, this tahsil perhaps excels any other part of the District. It is studded with fine mango groves, but except in the case of a few villages hardly any traces of forest survive. Its Kurm\u00ed husbandmen are noted for their laborious and skilful agriculture. The surface is drained by several minor rivers flowing south to meet the Gh\u00e1gra. The tahsil is almost entirely protected by irrigation from the risks of famine. The soil is for the most part the light loam known as dor\u00e1s. Sugar-cane and poppy are the most valuable products, and potatoes and vegetables are successfully cultivated. In 1883, Deoria tahsil contained 1 civil and 2 criminal courts, with 7 th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police stations; strength of regular police, 90 men, with 512 chaukid\u00e1rs or village watchmen.\n\n**Deotigarh.**\u2014Mountain range in the Province of Assam, forming a portion of the south-eastern boundary of the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills District, where it marches with Manipur. The range is really a prolongation of the Barel range, and contains the fine peaks of Khurrho (8804 feet) and Kopamidza (8376 feet). It contains the sources of the B\u00e1r\u00e1k, D\u00e1yang,\nand Makru rivers. The lower slopes project in table-shaped masses with grassy slopes.\n\n**Dera.**\u2014Southern tahsil of K\u00e1ngra District, Punjab. Area, 502 square miles; population (1881) 121,423; persons per square mile, 242. Males numbered 62,710, and females 58,713. Hindus, 116,067; Sikhs, 275; Muhammadans, 5070; and 'others,' 11. Revenue of the tahsil, \u00a311,460. The sub-divisional staff consists of a tahsild\u00e1r and 2 honorary magistrates, presiding over 3 civil and 3 criminal courts. Number of police stations, 3; strength of regular police, 52 men, with 210 chaukid\u00e1rs.\n\n**Dera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n.**\u2014District in the Deraj\u00e1t Division of the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab (Panjab), lying between 28\u00b0 27' and 31\u00b0 15' N. lat., and between 69\u00b0 35' and 70\u00b0 59' E. long. Dera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n is the southernmost District of the Deraj\u00e1t Division or Commissionership. It is bounded on the north by Dera Ism\u00e1i\u0142 Kh\u00e1n; on the west by the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n Hills; on the south by the Upper Sind Frontier District; and on the east by the Indus. The District forms a narrow strip of country, about 198 miles long, with an average breadth of 25 miles, lying between the foot of the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n mountains and the river Indus. Area, 4517 square miles; population, according to the Census of 1881, 363,346 souls. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Dera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The District of Dera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n consists of a narrow strip of sandy lowland, shut in between the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n Hills and the bank of the river Indus. On the west, the mountains rise in a succession of knife-like ridges towards the hilly plateau beyond the frontier, and give shelter to independent tribes of Baluch\u00ed origin. From their feet, the plain slopes gradually eastward, in a dreary and monotonous level, only broken from time to time by sandy undulations, and composed of a hard clay which requires profuse irrigation before it will yield to the arts of the cultivator. Numerous torrents pour down from the hilly barrier on the west, but soon sink into the thirsty soil, or are checked by artificial embankments for the water-supply of the surrounding fields. The Kaha and the Sanghar alone possess perennial streams, all the minor watercourses drying up entirely during the summer months. The whole western half of the District, known as the Pach\u00e1d, is then totally deserted, and its Baluch\u00ed inhabitants seek pasturage for their flocks either among the hills beyond the frontier, or in the moister lands which fringe the bank of the Indus. Water can only be procured from wells in this arid region at a depth of 250 or 300 feet. Between the Pach\u00e1d and the river, a barren belt of desert sand intervenes\u2014without water, without inhabitants, and without vegetation. Of late years, attempts have been made by Government to sink wells, but the expense of such works is very great. An\nartesian well was recently sunk to supply water to the military post at R\u00e1janpur, which is 388 feet deep. Other similar wells are in course of construction at selected places on the frontier. As the plain still slopes eastward, it reaches at last a level at which the waters of the Indus begin to fertilize the sandy soil. This tract is known as the Sind or Indus country, owing to its being irrigated by canals or wells which owe their water to moisture imparted by the river. This tract supports a far denser population than the dreary Pach\u00e1d. It is occupied, for the most part, by J\u00e1ts, Hindus, and miscellaneous tribes of Baluch\u00eds. The country rapidly assumes a fresher and greener aspect, a few trees appear upon the scene, and human habitations grow more and more numerous as the cultivated plain approaches the Indus itself. Much of the land in the lower slopes lies open to direct inundation from its floods, while the higher tracts are irrigated by canals and wells. This portion of the District comprises the greater part of the whole cultivated area, and has also considerable tracts of jungle under the management of the Forest Department. Date palms grow luxuriantly in picturesque groves, and shelter the town and cantonment of Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n with their pleasant shade. With these exceptions, however, the District is almost destitute of trees, and even in the most favoured parts the jungle seldom attains a height of more than 12 or 15 feet. The wood serves chiefly as fuel for the steamers on the Indus. While the two great natural divisions of the country are those universally known as the Pach\u00e1d and the Sindh, other minor tracts exist, such as the arid d\u00e1nda tract between the Pach\u00e1d and the Sind, which lies beyond the reach of the canals on the one side, and of the hill streams on the other. Then there are the K\u00e1l\u00e1p\u00e1n\u00ed tracts in the Sangarh and J\u00e1mpur tahsils, so called because they are irrigated by the blue-black water of two perennial hill streams; and the Garkh\u00e1b tract in R\u00e1janpur tahsil, which is annually swept by inundations of the Indus. The main irrigation canals are 15 in number, two under private management, and the remainder controlled by the Irrigation Department. The principal peaks of the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n mountains are at Ek Bhai opposite Sakpi Sarwar, with an elevation of 7462 feet; the Gandh\u00e1ri peak opposite Rojhah is also lofty, but its exact height has not been ascertained. To the south of Dr\u00e1gul is the M\u00e1ri mountain, the summit of which forms a large and fairly level plateau. This, and the G\u00e1ganka-Than plateau below Ek Bhai, are now approached by good roads, and are occupied occasionally during the hot weather months by officers from R\u00e1janpur and Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n. The temperature of the higher parts of the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n Hills is exceedingly pleasant at the time when the heat of the plains is most trying. The most important of the 92 passes leading from the\nDistrict, are those of Sanghar, Sakhi Sarwar, Ch\u00e1char, Kaha, and Sor\u00ed. They are all held by independent Baluch\u00eds, responsible to the British Government for the police duties of their respective highways, in return for which service they receive a money allowance from the Government of about \u00a3500 a year. The Sanghar pass leads into the Bozd\u00e1r country; the Sakhi Sarwar pass into the Khatr\u00e1n and L\u00fani-Path\u00e1n country; the Kaha and Ch\u00e1char into the Khatr\u00e1n, M\u00e1ri, and Bugl\u00ed; and the Sor\u00ed pass into the M\u00e1ri and Bugl\u00ed country. A chain of forts along the frontier road are occupied by detachments of cavalry or infantry from the Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n or R\u00e1janpur garrisons, or by the Baluch\u00ed frontier militia.\n\nThe Indus forms the eastern boundary of the District. In Sanghar tahsil it flows under a high bank, but elsewhere the level of the river is to all appearance very little below that of the surrounding country. The river is constantly changing its course. At one time the S\u00edtpur tahsil, which now forms part of Muzaffargarh District, was on the Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n side of the river; and the former heads of the Dh\u00fandi, Kut\u00e1b, and K\u00e1dra canals can still be traced in Muzaffargarh, whilst the canals themselves are now on the Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n side. Below the confluence of the Panjn\u00e1d with the Indus, a series of large islands have been formed in the Indus, which flows now on one side, and the next year on the other side of these islands; and as the river here forms the boundary between Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n District and Bah\u00e1walpur State, many disputes necessarily arise as to the ownership of land between the villages on either bank. Inundations from the Indus of a disastrous character frequently occur, which are locally known as chal. Beginning to rise after the melting of the interior snows in June, the river gradually swells till it fills its channel, in some places as much as nine miles in width, and finds an outlet at certain points into the country beyond, throwing it under water for miles around. The river usually rises about $8\\frac{1}{2}$ feet in the inundation season, but occasionally even higher. The greatest floods on record are those of 1833 and 1841. In the latter year the river is said to have travelled as far as Torbela with a velocity of 11 miles an hour, and to have risen to a height of 20 feet at one of the widest parts of the Shayor valley. In 1856, a flood occurred from which the people still calculate their dates. The station and cantonment of Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n was swept away by this flood, which spread some 10 miles inland. These inundations benefit the villages near which they take their rise, and in which they deposit their silt. But they impoverish other villages which they pass over after having left their silt; and in those villages in which the water remains stagnant, reh efflorescence soon makes its appearance.\n\nAmong minerals, iron, copper, and lead are said to exist in\nthe hills, but no mines are worked. Coal of a good quality has been discovered in the hills a few miles beyond the border, but not in veins of sufficient thickness to render its working in any way remunerative. Alum is excavated and refined in the extreme south of the District. Earth, salt, and saltpetre are also manufactured. Mult\u00e1ni *matti*, a saponine earth, of a drab colour and somewhat resembling fuller's earth, is found in the hills, and is used both medicinally and as a substitute for soap. True fuller's earth is also found. *Sajji*, a coarse carbonate of soda, is manufactured from the burnt ashes of a bush called *khar* (Salsola griffithii). The jungle products include\u2014*munj* grass, which is found in great abundance in the tracts exposed to the inundations of the Indus. *Shakh*, a gum obtained from the tamarisk, is largely collected for medicinal use as a cooling beverage. The wild animals comprise tigers, deer, wild hog, wild asses, and numerous feathered game, including black and grey partridges, duck, teal, sand grouse, etc. Fish of many sorts abound in the Indus.\n\n**History.**\u2014The tract between the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n mountains and the Indus appears to have been the seat of a Hindu population from a very remote date. Many towns in the District have close associations with Hindu legend, and especially with the mythical Punjab hero, Ras\u00e1lu. Ruins still exist at Sanghar and elsewhere, which probably date back to a period earlier than the Muhammadan invasion of India; while tradition connects the surrounding country with the ancient kingdom of Mult\u00e1n (Mooltan), of which it historically forms a part. Like the rest of that territory, it fell in the year 712 A.D. before the young Arab conqueror Muhammad K\u00e1sim, the first Musalm\u00e1n invader of India. Throughout the period of Muhammadan supremacy, the District continued to rank as an outlying appanage of the Mult\u00e1n Province. About the year 1450 A.D., the N\u00e1h\u00edrs, a branch of the Lodi family, connected with the dynasty which then sat upon the throne of Delhi, succeeded in establishing an independent government at Kin and S\u00edtpur; the former town lying in the southern portion of the present District, while the latter, by a change in the shifting channel of the Indus, has since been transferred to the eastern bank of the river. The N\u00e1hir dynasty soon extended their dominions for a considerable distance through the Deraj\u00e1t; but as time went on, their power was circumscribed by the encroachments of Baluch\u00ed mountaineers upon the western frontier. Malik Sohr\u00e1b Baluch\u00ed, the first of these hardy invaders, was followed by the Mahr\u00e1ni chieftain H\u00e1j\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, whose son, Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, gave his name to the city which he founded, and to the modern District which lies around it. This event must have taken place before the end of the 15th century. The new rulers at first held their dominions as vassals of the Mult\u00e1n Government, but\nin the third generation they found themselves strong enough to throw off the yoke and proclaim their independence of the Lod\u00ed court. Eighteen princes of the same family held successively the lower Deraj\u00e1t, and bore alternately the names of their ancestors H\u00e1j\u00ed and Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n. In the extreme south, however, the N\u00e1hir rulers continued to maintain their position until the early part of the 18th century. Under the house of Akbar, the dynasty of Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n made a nominal submission to the Mughal Empire; but though they paid a quit-rent, and accepted their lands in j\u00e1g\u00edr, their practical independence remained undisturbed. During the decline of the Mughals, and the rise of the rival Dur\u00e1ni Empire, the country west of the Indus came into the hands of N\u00e1d\u00edr Sh\u00e1h in 1739. The twentieth successor of Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n then sat upon the throne of his barren principality; but having made submission to the new suzerain, he was duly confirmed in the possession of his family estates. He died shortly after, however, leaving no heirs; and Dera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n became once more, in name at least, an integral portion of the M\u00falt\u00e1n Province. The date of this event, though by no means free from doubt, may be placed in or near the year 1758. About the same time, the District appears to have been overrun and conquered by the Kalhora kings of Sind, whose relations with the feudatories of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni in this portion of their dominions are far from clear. In any case, Ahmad Sh\u00e1h's authority would seem to have been restored about 1770 by one Mahm\u00fad G\u00fajar, an active and enterprising governor, who did good service in excavating canals, and bringing the waste land into cultivation. A series of Afgh\u00e1n rulers succeeded, under the Dur\u00e1ni Emperors; but this period was much disturbed by internecine warfare among the Baluch\u00ed clans, who now held the whole District. Before long, all semblance of order disappeared, and a reign of anarchy set in, which only terminated with British annexation and the introduction of a firm and peaceable government. Canals fell into disrepair; cultivation declined; the steady and industrious amongst the peasantry emigrated to more prosperous tracts; and the whole District sank into a condition more wretched and desolate than that which had prevailed up to the accession of Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, three centuries before.\n\nThe town of Dera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n was founded by Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, and it was not till his time that the District acquired its present name. Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n died in 1494, and was succeeded by his son H\u00e1j\u00ed Kh\u00e1n. For fifteen generations successive Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1ns and H\u00e1j\u00ed Kh\u00e1ns ruled at Dera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed. The village round the town of Dera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed is thus H\u00e1j\u00ed Gh\u00e1z\u00ed. The first grant of the family estates by way of imperial j\u00e1g\u00edr is said to have been made by the Emperor Hum\u00e1y\u00fan. H\u00e1j\u00ed Kh\u00e1n II., son of Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n I., made further acquisitions of territory towards the south, in addition to\nthe estates acquired by his father and grandfather; and during the distracted state of India which preceded the consolidation of the Empire under Akbar, the family maintained itself in complete independence. It was subsequently reduced to a comparatively dependent position, holding its estates merely as a j\u00e1g\u00edr under the Empire. In 1700, towards the close of Aurangzeb's reign, one of the Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1ns rebelled, and was defeated by the Governor of Mult\u00e1n. The last Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n died leaving no direct male heir; in 1739, Muhammad Sh\u00e1h the Persian ceded all the country west of the Indus to Nad\u00edr Sh\u00e1h. The kings of Khorasan were therefore the actual rulers of Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n for thirty-seven years before the dynasty became extinct. N\u00e1d\u00edr Sh\u00e1h was killed in 1747, and was succeeded by Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni, who was followed by a series of short-reigned Dur\u00e1ni and Barakzai princes. Meanwhile the Sikh power had been rising in the Punjab proper, and culminated under Ranjit Singh in a great and consolidated empire. In 1819, the aggressive Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 extended his conquests in this direction beyond the Indus, and annexed the southern portion of the present District. S\u00e1d\u00edk Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, Naw\u00e1b of Bah\u00e1walpur, received the newly-acquired territory as a fief, on payment of an annual tribute to Lahore. In 1827, the Naw\u00e1b overran the northern portion of the District, all of which passed under the suzerainty of the Sikhs. Three years later, however, in 1830, he was compelled to give up his charge in favour of General Ventura, the partisan leader of the Lahore forces. In 1832, the famous S\u00e1wan Mall of Mult\u00e1n (see Multan District) took over the District in farm; and his son Mulr\u00e1j continued in possession until the outbreak of hostilities with the British in 1848. At the close of the second Sikh war in the succeeding year, Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n passed, with the remainder of the Punjab Province, into the hands of our Government. Since that period, an active and vigilant administration has preserved the District from any more serious incident than the occasional occurrence of a frontier raid. The wild hill-tribes have been brought into comparative submission, while the restoration of the canals has once more made tillage profitable, and largely increased the number of inhabitants. The Mutiny of 1857 found Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n so peacefully disposed, that the protection of the frontier and the civil station could be safely entrusted to a home levy of 600 men; while the greater part of the regular troops were withdrawn for service in the field elsewhere. On the whole, the District may be cited as a striking instance of the prosperity and security afforded by a strong but benevolent Government in a naturally barren tract, formerly desolated by border strife and internal anarchy.\n\nPopulation.\u2014In 1854 the number of inhabitants was returned at 238,964. In 1868 it had reached a total of 308,840, showing an\nincrease for the fourteen years of 69,876 persons, or 29\u00b724 per cent. The last Census, that of 1881, taken over an area of 4517 square miles, showed a total of 363,346 persons dwelling in 603 villages or towns, and in 58,543 houses. These figures yield the following averages:\u2014 Persons per square mile, 80; villages per square mile, '13; houses per square mile, 18; persons per village, 602; persons per house, 6\u00b72. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 200,667; females, 162,679; proportion of males, 55\u00b723 per cent. Classified according to religion, there were 46,697 Hindus; 315,240 Muhammadans; 1326 Sikhs; 82 Christians; and 1 unspecified. The Musalm\u00e1n element thus amounted to 86\u00b777 per cent. of the whole population, while the proportion of Hindus and Sikhs together was only 13\u00b724 per cent. Among the Muhammadans, 160,405 are classed as J\u00e1ts, a term which appears to include all the agricultural tribes, once Hindu, but long since converted to the faith of the dominant races from the west, who have more recently settled in the District. Foremost among the latter in social and political importance stand the different Baluch\u00ed tribes, who in 1881 numbered 115,749, or 31\u00b786 per cent. of the whole population. A few Path\u00e1ns (9871) and Sayyids represent the later colonists in the District. The geographical boundary between the Path\u00e1n and Baluch\u00ed races in the hills nearly corresponds with the northern limit of the District; and it follows that the Baluch\u00eds are more numerous in Dera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n than in any other portion of the Punjab. The settlers, in the western half of the District especially, retain in a very marked manner the tribal organization of their native hills. Each clan owes allegiance to a hereditary chieftain (tumand\u00e1r), assisted by a council of head-men who represent the sub-divisions of the clan. Though shorn of certain monarchical prerogatives by the necessity of submission to an alien rule, the influence of the tumand\u00e1rs still ranks paramount for good or for evil; and our Government has found it desirable to rule the clans through their means. They receive official recognition, and enjoy certain assignments of land revenue, fixed in 1873 at \u00a33600. The Baluch\u00eds, inured to toil, and endowed with great powers of endurance, have a special hatred of control, and can scarcely be induced to enlist in our army, or to take any regular service. The mass of the population live in small hamlets, scattered over the face of the country; and a vast majority subsist by agricultural or pastoral pursuits. For further information regarding the Baluch\u00ed tribes, see the article BALUCHISTAN, vol. ii. pp. 27-40.\n\nThe District contains five municipal towns, only two of which have a population exceeding 5000\u2014Dera Ghazi Khan, 22,309; Dajal, including Naushahra, with which it forms one municipality, 7913; Jampur, 4697; Rajanpur, 4932; and Mithankot, 3353.\nDera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, the civil and military head-quarters, ranks as a trading mart of considerable activity. R\u00e1janpur, in the south of the District, 73 miles from head-quarters, is the station of an Assistant Commissioner and of a regiment of cavalry. Mithankot, once a busy commercial centre, has now sunk into the position of a quiet country town. Several Muhammadan shrines of great reputed sanctity are scattered over the District, the principal being that of Sakhi Sarwar, which is resorted to by Muhammadans and Hindus alike, and is a curious mixture of both styles of architecture. One or more annual fairs are held at each of these shrines and holy places.\n\n**Agriculture.**\u2014The cultivated area of Dera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n has increased enormously since the introduction of British rule. Early returns show the total area under tillage at 261,065 acres in 1849, and at 276,981 acres in 1859; while the Punjab Administration Report for 1880-81 gives a total cultivation of 1,086,413 acres, of which 438,205 received artificial irrigation, namely, 270,158 acres by Government works, and 168,047 by private individuals. The staple crops of the District consist of wheat and jo\u00e1r. The former ranks as the principal produce of the *rab\u00ed* or spring harvest in the Sind; the latter is grown as a *khar\u00edf* or autumn crop in the Pach\u00e1d. Barley, poppy, gram, peas, turnips, and mustard also cover a considerable area in the *rab\u00ed*; while rice, pulses, cotton, indigo, tobacco, and oil-seeds form the chief supplementary items of the *khar\u00edf*. The estimated area under the principal crops is thus returned in 1881:\u2014Wheat, 180,781 acres; rice, 22,939 acres; other cereals, such as jo\u00e1r (great millet), bajra (spiked millet), kangni (Italian millet), makai (Indian corn), jao (barley), 195,486 acres; pulses, including gram (Cicer arietinum), *moth* (Phaseolus aconitifolius), *matar* (peas), *mash* (Phaseolus radiatus), *mung* (Phaseolus mungo), *masur* (Ervum lens), *arhar* (Cajanus indicus), 18,314 acres; oil-seeds, including *sarson* or mustard, *til* (Sesamum orientale), and *t\u00e1r\u00e1mira* (Sinapis eruca), 28,841 acres; cotton, 99,545 acres; and indigo, 11,655 acres. Throughout the whole District, cultivation depends entirely upon artificial irrigation, derived from three sources,\u2014the hill streams, the wells, and the inundation canals from the Indus. The last begin to fill, in prosperous years, towards the end of June, when the sowings at once commence. The Pach\u00e1d can only produce a good autumn crop if the hill torrents fill some time between May and August; but when rain does not fall until September, the cultivator abandons all hope of the *khar\u00edf*, and sows his land with wheat or some other spring staple. The number of main channels drawing their supplies directly from the Indus is 15, two of which belong to private proprietors, while the remainder are controlled and kept in order by the State. A well, unaided by canal supplies, suffices to irrigate an average of 10 acres; with the assistance of a canal, it can\nwater an area of 30 acres. In the latter case, however, only half the land is cultivated at a time, and each field lies fallow after every second crop. The average out-turn of wheat or jo\u00e1r per acre amounts to $7\\frac{1}{2}$ cwts.; that of cotton to 1 cwt. 14 lbs. of cleaned fibre. The agricultural stock in the District is approximately estimated as follows:\u2014Cows and bullocks, 81,901; horses, 2913; ponies, 450; donkeys, 4722; sheep and goats, 91,015; camels, 6930; ploughs, 12,125.\n\nThe District has no village communities in the sense which the term usually implies in India. The villages consist of holdings classified into mere artificial groups for purposes of revenue collection. The only bond of union between the proprietors consists in their joint responsibility for the payment of taxes. The proportion of land belonging to each proprietor is stated by wells or fractions of a well in the Sind, and by bandhs or irrigation embankments in the Pach\u00e1d. Eight wells form a large holding, while one-fourth of a well would be the smallest amount capable of supporting a cultivating proprietor. Rents usually take the shape of a charge in kind upon the produce. Tenants-at-will pay from one-seventh to one-half the gross out-turn; a quarter may be regarded as the average. Agricultural labourers receive their wages in kind, to the value of from 4\u00bdd. to 6d. per diem. Skilled workmen in the towns earn from 1s. to 1s. 3d. per diem. Of a total population of 363,340, 179,821 were returned in 1881 as male agriculturists, of whom 54,364 were above 15 years of age. Total area paying Government revenue or quit-rent, 3944 square miles, of which 1404 square miles are cultivated, and 1580 square miles cultivable. Total Government revenue, including rates and cesses, \u00a344,364; estimated value of rental paid by cultivators, \u00a392,395. The prevailing prices per cwt. for the principal agricultural staples in 1880\u201381, are returned as follows:\u2014Wheat, 9s. 8d.; flour, 11s. 2d.; best rice, 17s. 1\u00bdd.; barley, 6s. 8d.; gram, 8s. 1d.; jo\u00e1r, 6s. 9d.; b\u00e1jra, 8s. 9d.; cleaned cotton, \u00a32, 11s. 2d.; and sugar (refined), \u00a32, 16s.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014Petty Hindu merchants, settled in almost every village, entirely control the trade of the District. Their dealings centre chiefly in the commercial town of Dera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n. The Indus forms the high road of traffic. Mithankot, just below its junction with the united stream of the Punjab rivers, was long the mercantile capital of the District; but a diversion of the navigable channel 5 miles to the east has turned the course of traffic to the head-quarters town. Thence, indigo, opium, dates, wheat, cotton, barley, millet, ghi, and hides, are despatched down the river to Sukkur (Sakkar) and Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed (Kurrachee). The annual value of the opium exported amounts to \u00a32500; that of indigo probably exceeds \u00a310,000. The grain of all kinds may be estimated at \u00a360,000. Sugar, gram, woollen goods, English piece-goods and broadcloth,\nmetals, salt, and spices form the principal items of the import trade. Little traffic at present exists with the country beyond the hills, owing to the turbulence of the independent Baluch\u00ed tribes. Commercial importance has lately attached to the annual religious gathering at the shrine of a Muhammadan saint, Sakhi Sarwar. The chief means of communication consist of\u2014the Frontier military road, which passes through the District from north to south; the river road from Dera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n to Sukkur; and the road from the head-quarters station to Mult\u00e1n, crossing the Indus at the Kureshi ferry. None of these are metalled, but they cross the canals and hill-streams for the most part by means of bridges. The total length of unmetalled roads within the District amounted in 1882 to 1565 miles. The length of navigable river communication is 235 miles.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District staff ordinarily comprises a Deputy Commissioner, with a judicial Assistant Commissioner, two Assistant and one extra-Assistant Commissioners, besides the usual fiscal, constabulary, and medical officers. The total amount of revenue (excluding income-tax) raised in the District in 1861\u201362 was returned at \u00a337,182. In 1882\u201383 it had reached the sum of \u00a349,739. The land-tax forms the principal item of receipt, yielding (exclusive of canal collections) in 1882\u201383 a total of \u00a335,020, or four-fifths of the whole. The other chief items are stamps and excise. In 1882\u201383, the District contained 16 civil and revenue courts of all grades, and 18 magistrates\u2019 courts. The regular or Imperial police in 1882 consisted of a force of 394 men, of whom 303 were available for protective or defensive duties, the remainder being employed as guards over jails, treasuries, etc. There is also a river patrol of 28, and a municipal force of 84 men. As regards crime, out of 896 \u2018cognisable\u2019 cases investigated during the year, convictions were obtained in 436; the total number of persons arrested in connection with these cases was 1226, of whom 803 were finally convicted. Cattle theft is described as the normal crime of the District, an offence which, owing to the large tracts of waste and jungle, is very difficult to deal with; 192 cases occurred in 1881. Murder is also a common offence; 19 such cases occurred in 1881, of which conviction was obtained in 10. The District jail at Dera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, a large and substantial building, had a daily average number of 372 prisoners in 1880. The R\u00e1janpur lock-up during the same year had a daily average of 80 inmates. The military force maintained in the District for the protection of the frontier comprises 2 regiments of infantry and 2 of cavalry. One regiment of cavalry and one company of infantry are stationed at R\u00e1janpur; and the remainder at Dera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n. A force of mounted militia, levied among the Baluch\u00ed tribes of the Pach\u00e1d, assists the regular troops in the maintenance of order.\nIn 1882-83, the District had only 40 regularly-inspected schools, with a total roll of 1895 scholars. There were also, according to Dr. G. F. Leitner's Report, a total of 179 indigenous village schools, in which education of some sort is imparted to about 1650 children. The five municipalities of Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n, J\u00e1mpur, R\u00e1janpur, Mithankot, and D\u00e1jal with Naushahra, had an aggregate revenue in 1882-83 of \u00a34148, and an expenditure of \u00a35255; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 1\u00bdd. per head of municipal population.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n cannot be considered an unhealthy District, although the heat in summer often reaches an intense degree. The annual rainfall for the eighteen years ending 1880 averaged only 7.06 inches, the maximum during that period being 10.8 inches in 1869-70. The total rainfall in 1880 was only 4.2 inches. Fever of the ordinary type prevails in August and September, when cold nights alternate with hot days. In June and July, a scorching and unhealthy wind sweeps down from the hills into the Pach\u00e1d. Four charitable dispensaries gave relief in 1881 to 52,781 persons, of whom 1381 were in-patients; total expenditure on dispensaries in 1881, \u00a31109, of which \u00a3610 was derived from local sources, and \u00a3468 contributed by Government. [For further information regarding Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n District, see the forthcoming Punjab Gazetteer; also Mr. F. W. R. Fryer's Report on the Settlement Operations from 1869 to 1874; together with the Punjab Census Report for 1881, and the Punjab Administration and Departmental Reports from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nDera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n.\u2014Tahsil of Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n District, Punjab, consisting of a narrow strip of land between the Indus and the Sul\u00e1i-man mountains. Lat. 29\u00b0 36' to 30\u00b0 30' 30\" N., and long. 70\u00b0 11' to 70\u00b0 59' E. Area, 1362 square miles. Population (1881) 159,733, namely, males 88,120, and females 71,613. Persons per square mile, 117. Hindus numbered 22,750; Sikhs, 525; Muhammadans, 136,388; and 'others,' 70. Revenue of the tahsil, \u00a318,426. The administrative staff consists of a Deputy Commissioner, a Judicial Assistant, 2 Assistant or extra-Assistant Commissioners, 1 tahsild\u00e1r, 1 munsif, and 3 honorary magistrates. These officers preside over 8 civil and 8 criminal courts. Number of police stations, 4; strength of regular police, 105 men; with 68 village watchmen.\n\nDera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n.\u2014Town and administrative head-quarters of Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n District, Punjab. Lat. 30\u00b0 3' N., and long. 70\u00b0 50' E. Situated in lat. 30\u00b0 3' 57\" N., and long. 70\u00b0 49' E., about 2 miles west of the present bed of the Indus, which once flowed past its site. Population (1881) 22,309, namely 10,140 Hindus, 11,687 Muhammadans, 413 Sikhs, and 69 Christians. Number of houses, 3159. The Kasturi Canal skirts its eastern border,\nfringed with thickly-planted gardens of mango trees; while gh\u00e1ts line the banks, thronged in summer by numerous bathers. Above the town stands a massive dam, erected in 1858 as a protection against inundations. A mile to the west lies the civil station, and the cantonments adjoin the houses of the District officials. The original station stood to the east of the town, but disappeared during the flood of 1857. The town owes its foundation to Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n Mahr\u00e1ni, a Baluch settler in the District, who made himself independent in this remote tract about the year 1475. It has continued ever since to be the seat of local administration under the successive Governments which have ruled the surrounding country. (See Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n District.) The court-house occupies the reputed site of Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n\u2019s garden; while the tahs\u00edl and police office replace an ancient fort, levelled at the time of the English annexation. The other public buildings include a town hall, school-house, dispensary, staging bungalow, and post-office. A handsome b\u00e1z\u00e1r has several good shops, built on a uniform plan. Many large and striking mosques adorn the town, the chief being those of Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n, Abdul Jaw\u00e1r, and Ch\u00fat\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n. The Sikhs converted three of them into temples of their own faith during their period of supremacy. Two Muhammadan saints are also honoured with shrines, and the earlier religion has four temples dedicated to Hindu gods. The trade of Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n is not large: exports\u2014indigo, opium, dates, wheat, cotton, barley, millet, gh\u00ed, and hides; imports\u2014sugar, K\u00e1b\u00fal fruits, English piece-goods, metal, salt, and spices. Silk and cotton manufacture, formerly thriving, has now declined. Weekly fair on the banks of the canal during the summer months. Ordinary garrison, 1 cavalry and 2 infantry regiments of the Punjab Frontier force. Municipal revenue in 1882\u201383, \u00a32619; expenditure, \u00a33380; average incidence of municipal taxation, 2s. 4\u00bdd. per head.\n\nDera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n.\u2014District in the Deraj\u00e1t Division of the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab (Panj\u00e1b), lying between 30\u00b0 36' and 32\u00b0 33' N. lat., and between 70\u00b0 14' and 72\u00b0 2' E. long.; with an area of 9296 square miles, and a population (1881) of 441,649 persons. Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n forms the central District of the Deraj\u00e1t Division. It consists of a strip of country stretching from the foot of the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n Hills, across the hills into the Th\u00e1l of the Sind S\u00e1g\u00e1r Do\u00e1b. It is bounded on the north by Bannu District; on the east by Jhang and Sh\u00e1hpur; on the south by Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n and Muza\u0444\u0444argarh; and on the west by the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n mountains, which separate India from Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n. Its average length from north to south is about 110 miles, and its average width about 80 miles. It is divided into 5 tahs\u00edls, of which that of Tank occupies the extreme north-western corner of the District. The remainder of the Trans-Indus tract is\ndivided between the tahsils of Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n and Kul\u00e1ch\u00ed. The cis-Indus area is divided by a line running east and west into the two tahsils of Bhakkar and Leiah, the former comprising the northern portion. These two tahsils constitute a separate Sub-division, and are in charge of an Assistant Commissioner stationed at Bhakkar. The administrative head-quarters of the District are at the town of Dera Ismail Khan.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n, a purely artificial creation for administrative purposes, comprises two distinct tracts of country, stretching from the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n mountains across the valley of the Indus far into the heart of the Sind S\u00e1g\u00e1r Do\u00e1b. The channel of the great river thus divides it into two sections, each of which possesses a history and physical characteristics of its own. To the west, the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n mountains rise barren and precipitous above the hard alluvial plain, ascending in a series of parallel ridges, which culminate nearly opposite Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n in the two peaks of Takht-i-Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n, 11,295 and 11,070 feet respectively above the level of the sea. The range is the home of various independent tribes, responsible to our Government for the maintenance of peace upon the frontier, and the prevention of robbery among the passes. Numerous mountain torrents score the hill-sides, and cut for themselves deep and intricate ravines in the plain below; but little of their water reaches the Indus even in times of heavy flood. Only one among them, the Gum\u00e1l or L\u00fani, is a perennial stream. On the north, some low and stony spurs project into the valley, till finally the Shaikh-Bud\u00edn range closes the view upward and separates this District from that of Bannu. Near the Indus, a third rugged group, the Khisor Hills, intervenes between the Shaikh-Bud\u00edn system and the river, which is overhung by its eastern face in a precipitous mass, some 3000 feet above the sea. From this point the plain stretches southward along the river-side, till it merges in the similar tract of Dera Ghazi Khan District. Sloping downwards from the feet of the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n range through an intermediate barren belt, it gradually attains a lower level, at which percolation from the Indus makes its influence felt. Cultivation soon becomes general, and the soil of this lowland tract supports a population of considerable density. In the summer months, the river, rising 6 feet above its cold-weather level, submerges the country for 11 miles inland; while canals and natural channels convey its fertilizing waters to a still greater distance from the main stream on either side. The principal channel shifts from year to year, causing great alteration in the conditions of agriculture. The eastern or Sind S\u00e1g\u00e1r portion of the District consists in part of a similar irrigated lowland, lying along the edge of the Indus. The limit of this favoured tract is marked by an abrupt bank, the outer margin of a high plateau, the Th\u00e1l, which stretches across the Do\u00e1b to the valley\nof the Jehlam (Jhelum). Below this bank, wide patches of closely-cultivated soil, interspersed with stretches of rank grass, or broken by occasional clumps of trees, meet the eye; but above appears the ordinary monotony of a Punjab desert, extending in a level surface of sand, or rolling into rounded hillocks and long undulating dunes. Yet the soil beneath is naturally rich; and unless the rainfall entirely fails, a yearly crop of grass pushes its way through the sandy covering, and suffices to support vast flocks of sheep and cattle. Patches of scrubby jungle here and there diversify the scene; while the coarse vegetation of the general surface affords excellent fodder for camels. Cultivation, however, can only be carried on by means of laborious artificial irrigation from deep wells, and nothing but the brave and steady industry of the inhabitants renders life possible in this sterile region.\n\nIron is produced in the Waziri hills, but no metals exist within the District itself. Traces of lignite and a little alum, naphtha, yellow ochre, and saltpetre are found in the Shaikh-Bud\u00edn range. Sajji, an impure carbonate of soda, is sometimes manufactured for sale, but chiefly by washermen for their private use. No quarries of any sort are worked. The hills supply abundance of limestone for building purposes. As regards wild animals, the antelope is unknown, and only a few ravine and hog-deer are found. Game is rapidly disappearing, owing to the increase of cultivation. The tiger is extinct; and even wild hog are only to be found in certain outlying tracts. The wild ass (ghor-khor) has entirely disappeared from the District. Hares were formerly numerous, but were drowned out during a high flood in 1874, and hardly one is now left. Occasionally wolves, foxes, and jackals are found, and a few leopards haunt the Shaikh-Bud\u00edn hills. Otters are common in the Indus, where they are caught by the Kehars, a wandering tribe, and used in hunting fish. A species of field mouse is often very destructive to the crops. Game birds consist of wild duck, wild goose, sand grouse, quail, grey and black partridges, chikor, snipe, etc. The great bustard is occasionally met with, and the small bustard affords good sport for hawking. The fisheries are confined to the Indus and its tributaries.\n\nHistory.\u2014The massive ruins of two ancient forts, overlooking the Indus from projecting spurs of the northern hills, alone bear witness to an early civilisation in the Upper Deraj\u00e1t. Both bear the name of K\u00e1f\u00edr Kot (infidel's fort), probably connecting their origin with the Gr\u00e6co-Bactrian period of Punjab history. The plain portion of the District contains none of those ancient mounds which elsewhere mark the sites of ruined cities. But the earliest traditions current in this remote quarter refer to its later colonization by immigrants from the south, who found the country entirely unoccupied. The Baluch\u00ed\nsettlers, under M\u00e1lik Sohr\u00e1b, arrived in the District towards the end of the 15th century. His two sons, Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n and Fateh Kh\u00e1n, founded the towns which still bear their names. The Hot family, as this Baluch\u00ed dynasty was termed, in contradistinction to the Mahr\u00e1ni house of Dera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, held sway over the upper Deraj\u00e1t for 300 years, with practical independence, until reduced to vassalage by Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni about 1750 A.D. Beyond the Indus, too, the first important colony settled under the auspices of another Baluch\u00ed chieftain, whose descendants, surnamed Jask\u00e1ni, placed their capital for nearly three centuries at Bhakkar in the eastern lowlands of the great river. Farther south, the family of Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n established several settlements, the chief of which gathered round the town of Leiah. About the year 1759, the Kh\u00e1ns of Leiah were involved in the conquest of the parent family by the Kalhora kings of Sind. Shortly afterwards, Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni became supreme over the whole of the present District. In 1792, Sh\u00e1h Zam\u00e1n, then occupying the Dur\u00e1ni throne, conferred the government of this dependency, together with the title of Naw\u00e1b, upon Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, an Afgh\u00e1n of the Sadoz\u00e1i tribe, related to the famous governors of Mult\u00e1n (Mooltan). Armed with the royal grant, Muhammad Kh\u00e1n made himself master of almost all the District, and built himself a new capital at Manker\u00e1. He died in 1815, after a prosperous reign of twenty-three years. His grandson, Sher Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, succeeded to the principality, under the guardianship of his father, the late Naw\u00e1b\u2019s son-in-law. Ranjit Singh, however, was then engaged in consolidating his power by the subjection of the lower Punjab. Nothing daunted by the difficulties of a march across the desert, the great Sikh leader advanced upon Manker\u00e1, sinking wells as he approached for the supply of his army. After a siege of twenty-five days, the fortress surrendered, and the whole Sind S\u00e1g\u00e1r Do\u00e1b lay at the mercy of the conqueror. The young Naw\u00e1b retired beyond the Indus to Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n, retaining his dominions in the Deraj\u00e1t for fifteen years, subject to a quit-rent to the Sikhs, but otherwise holding the position of a semi-independent prince. His tribute, however, fell into arrears; and in 1836, N\u00e1o Nih\u00e1l Singh crossed the Indus at the head of a Sikh army, and annexed the remaining portion of the District to the territories of Lahore. The Naw\u00e1b received an assignment of revenue for his maintenance, still retained by his descendants, together with their ancestral title.\n\nUnder Sikh rule, the cis-Indus tract formed part of the Mult\u00e1n Province, administered by S\u00e1wan Mall and his son Mulr\u00e1j (see Mult\u00e1n District). The upper Deraj\u00e1t, on the other hand, was farmed out to the Diw\u00e1n Laki Mall, from whom it passed to his son, Daulat R\u00e1i. British influence first made itself felt in 1847, when Lieutenant (afterwards Sir Herbert) Edwardes, being despatched\nto the frontier as Political Officer under the Council of Regency at Lahore, effected a summary assessment of the land-tax. In the succeeding year, levies from Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n followed Edwardes to Mult\u00e1n, and served loyally throughout the war that ended in the annexation of the Punjab. The District then passed quietly under British rule. On the first sub-division of the Province, Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n became the head-quarters of a District, which also originally included the trans-Indus portion of Bannu; Leiah was erected into the centre of a second District east of the river. The present arrangement took effect in 1861, Bannu being entrusted to a separate officer, and the southern half of Leiah District being incorporated with Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n. In 1857, some traces of a mutinous spirit appeared amongst the troops in garrison at the head-quarters station; but the promptitude and vigour of the Deputy Commissioner, Colonel Coxe, loyally aided by a hasty levy of local horse averted the danger without serious difficulty. In 1870, the District attracted for a time a melancholy attention through the death of Sir Henry Durand, Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, who struck against an arch and was precipitated from his elephant as he entered a gateway in the town of T\u00e1nk. His remains were interred at Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The changes of territory in the cis-Indus portion of the District since the Census of 1855, render it impossible to institute a comparison between that enumeration and the returns of 1868 and 1881. In the trans-Indus Sub-division, however, which remains substantially unaltered in extent, a considerable increase took place between those dates. The Census of 1881 was taken over a total area of 9296 square miles, and it disclosed a total population of 441,649 persons, distributed among 746 villages or townships, and inhabiting an aggregate of 88,908 houses. These figures yield the following averages:\u2014Persons per square mile, 47; villages per square mile, 0\u00b708; houses per square mile, 9\u00b756; persons per village, 592; persons per house, 4\u00b795. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 238,468; females, 203,181; proportion of males, 53\u00b799 per cent. As regards the religious distinctions of the people, Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n contains an essentially Muhammadan population, as might be expected from the late date and quarter of its colonization. The Census showed 385,244 Musalm\u00e1ns, 54,446 Hindus, 1691 Sikhs, 2 Jains, 13 P\u00e1rsis, and 253 Christians. Amongst the Hindus, the Aroras form by far the largest element, numbering as many as 44,146 persons; they comprise the principal trading classes of the District, a few wealthy families being found in the larger towns, while the majority carry on business as petty dealers in corn or money throughout the country villages. The mass of the agricultural population are J\u00e1ts, the great majority of whom profess the Muhammadan religion, but are of Hindu or Scythian origin. Their\nancestors, according to tradition, accompanied the Baluch\u00ed chieftains on the first colonization of the District. The Path\u00e1ns or Afgh\u00e1ns occupy a strip of country extending immediately below the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n hills, throughout their whole length from north to south. Most of them belong to inconspicuous tribes, the highest in social position being connected with the Sadoz\u00e1\u00ed Naw\u00e1bs of Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n. In 1881, Path\u00e1ns numbered 73,022. Only three towns contained a population exceeding 5000 in 1881\u2014namely, Dera Ismail Khan, Kulachi, and Leiah. The municipal towns in 1881 were as follows:\u2014(1) Dera Ismail Khan, 22,164; (2) Kulachi, 7834; (3) Leiah, 5899; (4) Bhakkar, 4402; (5) Karor, 2723; (6) Paharpur, 2496. Tank (population, 2364) is the capital of an Afgh\u00e1n Principality till lately ruled by its semi-independent Naw\u00e1b, but now brought directly under British administration. The sanitarium of Shaikh-Budin, at an elevation of 4516 feet above sea-level, occupies the highest point in the hills which separate this District from Bannu. The seven municipal towns contained in 1881 a total of 47,882 inhabitants, leaving 393,767, or 89.1 per cent., for the rural population. With regard to occupation, the Census Report returns the male population under the following seven main divisions:\u2014Class (1) Professional, including civil and military officials and the learned professions, 6671; (2) domestic servants, lodging-house keepers, etc., 2631; (3) commercial class, including merchants, dealers, carriers, etc., 9960; (4) agricultural and pastoral, including gardeners, 68,931; (5) industrial and artisan and manufacturing class, 23,634; (6) labourers, and unspecified, 29,576; (7) male children below 15 years of age, 97,065.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Throughout all portions of Dera Ismail Kh\u00e1n District, tillage depends entirely upon artificial irrigation. The hill streams render but scanty service in this respect, their volume being speedily lost in the intricate ravines which they have cut for themselves through the hard clay of the submontane tract. Nevertheless they afford to the Afgh\u00e1ns of the border a chance of raising some few crops, sufficient for their own frugal subsistence. In the low-lying lands within the influence of the Indus, canals and wells offer an easy and abundant supply of water; but in the Th\u00e1l or Sind S\u00e1g\u00e1r uplands, wells can only be worked at an enormous depth. Even here, however, the indomitable energy of the J\u00e1t cultivators succeeds in producing harvests not inferior to those of the richest alluvial tracts. The State does not maintain any irrigation works in this District; but in 1880, a total of 370,579 acres were artificially watered by private enterprise. The area cultivated without irrigation amounted to 435,432 acres, giving a grand total of 806,011 acres under cultivation. The remainder of the District falls under the following heads:\u2014Grazing lands, 806,791 acres; cultivable waste, 3,204,918 acres; uncultivable waste, 1,131,900 acres. Wheat\nand barley form the staple products of the rabi or spring harvest, while the common millets, jo\u00e1r and b\u00e1jra, constitute the principal khar\u00edf or autumn crops. Sugar and tobacco are grown in the lowlands of the Indus, but not in sufficient quantities to meet the local demand. In 1880, the area in acres under the principal staples were returned as follows:\u2014Wheat, 283,433 acres; rice, 1673; jo\u00e1r (great millet), 18,360; b\u00e1jra (spiked millet), 110,825; makai (Indian corn), 542; jao (barley), 28,358; china (Panicum miliaceum), 600 acres; pulses, including gram (Cicer arietinum), moth (Phaseolus aconitium), matar or peas (Pisum sativum), mash (Phaseolus radiatus), mung (Phaseolus mungo), masur (Ervum lens), arhar (Cajanus indica), 39,270 acres; oil-seeds, 33,723 acres; cotton, 9939 acres. Of a total population of 441,649, 215,714 are returned as male agriculturists, of whom 60,925 were above fifteen years of age. Total area paying Government revenue or quit-rent, 7989 square miles, of which 1056 square miles are returned as cultivated, and 4329 as cultivable. Total Government revenue, including rates and cesses in 1881, \u00a349,860; estimated value of rental, including cesses, actually paid by cultivators, \u00a3107,541.\n\nThroughout the District, village communities of the ordinary types prevail, though many of them, especially among the Path\u00e1ns of the frontier, appear to have adopted the communal system only as a consequence of British fiscal arrangements. Elsewhere, in the J\u00e1t villages, the existence of immemorial common lands attests the indigenous nature of the institution. Rents are universally paid in kind, at rates which range as high as one-half of the gross produce. The agricultural stock in the District is approximately estimated as follows:\u2014Cows and bullocks, 182,257; horses, 3228; ponies, 496; donkeys, 11,146; sheep and goats, 485,308; camels, 10,738; ploughs, 58,940. Unskilled labourers in towns received from 4\u00bdd. to 6d. per diem in 1881; while skilled workmen obtained from 1s. to 1s. 3d. The prevailing prices per cwt. for the principal food-grains and agricultural staples in January 1881 is stated as under:\u2014Wheat, 10s. 10d.; flour, 12s. 5d.; barley, 7s. 3d.; gram, 8s.; Indian corn, 6s. 11d.; jo\u00e1r, 6s.; b\u00e1jra, 7s. 6d.; rice (best), \u00a31, 4s. 2d.; cotton, \u00a32, 16s. od.; sugar (refined), \u00a32, 11s. 2d.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014One of the main streams of caravan traffic between India and Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n traverses the District twice a year. The Povindah merchants cross the Gum\u00e1l Pass between T\u00e1nk and Kul\u00e1chi from early in October till the middle of December, and, after passing on into India proper, return again in April or May. They seldom, however, unpack any portion of their wares in the local markets. The traffic of the District centres in the towns of Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n, Leiah, and Bhakkar. Wheat, millet, and wool are thence despatched down the Indus to Mult\u00e1n (Mooltan), Sukkur (Sakkar), or Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee), while Indian and English piece-goods form the staples of\nimport trade. Hides from Sh\u00e1hpur and Jhang, salt from Koh\u00e1t and Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n, and fancy ware of various kinds from Mult\u00e1n and Sukkur, also figure upon the list of entries. Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n town and many villages have considerable manufactures of coarse cloth for domestic use. The main channels of communication consist of\u2014the Frontier military road, which skirts the base of the hills from north to south; the Mult\u00e1n and R\u00e1wal Pindi road, which follows the high right bank of the Indus, via Kot Sult\u00e1n, Leiah, Kharor, and Bhakkar; and the line from Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n to Jhang, and thence to Ch\u00edchawatni on the Lahore and Mult\u00e1n Railway. They are all practicable in ordinary seasons by wheeled conveyances or artillery. The Indus is bridged at Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n, opposite the cantonments, by a bridge of boats, from early in October till the end of April. This boat bridge is the longest of the kind in the Punjab, if not in India. The total length of roads within the District in 1880\u201381 amounted to 31 miles of metalled and 1538 miles of unmetalled roads. Water communication is afforded by 120 miles of navigable river (the Indus).\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District staff ordinarily comprises a Deputy Commissioner, with one Assistant and three extra-Assistant Commissioners, besides the usual fiscal, constabulary, and medical officers. The total amount of revenue raised in the District during the year 1880\u201381 was returned at \u00a359,286; of which sum, \u00a317,542 was contributed by the land-tax. A local revenue of about \u00a35000 provides for objects of public utility within the District itself. In 1880\u201381, Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n possessed 16 civil and revenue judges of all grades, 2 of whom were covenanted civilians; there were also 21 magistrates with criminal jurisdiction. The regular or Imperial police in 1881 consisted of a force of 505 men, of whom 387 were available for protective or defensive duties, the remainder being employed as guards over jails, treasuries, etc. There was also in the same year a municipal force of 68 men, and a ferry police of 9 men. As regards crime, out of 633 \u2018cognisable\u2019 cases investigated by the police during the year, convictions were obtained in 393; the total number of persons arrested in connection with these cases was 954, of whom 703 were finally convicted. The District jail at Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n received a total number of 1,470 inmates in 1880; while the daily average of prisoners for that and the two preceding years was 579. Education still remains at a low standard. The District contained 30 schools supported or aided by the Government in 1880\u201381, with an aggregate roll of 1996 scholars. The Church Missionary Society has an educational station at Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n, in receipt of a grant-in-aid from Government. The troops quartered in the District, for the defence of the Frontier, comprise 2 regiments of infantry, 1 regiment of cavalry, and a battery of field artillery, amounting in all to 2200 rank and file of all arms,\nwith 4 guns. The head-quarters are at Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n. A small force of local militia supplements the regular troops in the outpost stations upon the Frontier. The 6 municipal towns had an aggregate revenue in 1880-81 of \u00a35635; expenditure, \u00a35765; average incidence, 2s. 4\u00bdd. per head of municipal population.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of the District is dry and hot, the average monthly mean for a period of twelve years ending 1880 being 73\u00b09' F., ranging from 92\u00b07' in June to 51\u00b05' in January. In 1880, the thermometer registered a maximum temperature of 114\u00b05' in May, and a minimum of 56\u00b02' in December. Up to the middle of May, the climate is tolerable for Europeans; but after that date, the season of fierce summer-heat sets in. The average annual rainfall for a period of eighteen years ending 1880 amounted to only 8\u00b089 inches. In the latter year the rainfall was only 4 inches. The rainy season, or rather the period of occasional showers, occurs during the months of June, July, August, and September. Malarious fever, dysentery, and smallpox form the prevalent diseases of the District. The head-quarters station, however, bears a good reputation from a sanitary point of view. Six charitable dispensaries afforded relief in 1881 to 45,872 persons, of whom 1164 were in-patients.

Distant from the right bank of the Indus 4\u00bd miles west, from Lahore 200 miles west, and from Mult\u00e1n (Mooltan) 120 miles north-west. Founded in the end of the 15th century by Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n, one of the sons of the Baluch adventurer M\u00e1lik Sohr\u00e1b, who called the town after his own name.\n\nThe original city was swept away by a flood in 1823, and all the existing buildings are of quite modern construction. The town stands on a level plain, with a slight fall to the river, but so badly drained that pools of water collect for weeks after heavy rain, and many of the streets become impassable. Surrounded by a thin mud wall, with five gates, enclosing an area of about 500 acres. Tortuous and ill-ventilated alleys, especially in the Hindu quarter. The cantonments, which lie to the south-east of the town, contain a total area of 4\u00bd square miles. Lines exist for a regiment of Native cavalry, two regiments of Native infantry, and a battery of artillery. The cantonments also contain a church, staging bungalow, and swimming-bath. European detachments garrison the small fort of Akalgarh, half a mile from the north-west angle of the town. The ordinary garrison of the station consists of a mountain battery of artillery, a regiment of Native cavalry, and two of infantry, belonging to the Punjab Frontier Force, and commanded by the general officer commanding the force at Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d. Detachments from these regiments garrison the outposts of T\u00e1nk, Girni, Jatta, Manjhi, and Dr\u00e1bad. Ten militia posts are also maintained, exclusive of border police posts.\n\nThe civil station, which lies to the south of the native town, contains the offices of the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner, the courthouse, treasury, jail, police lines, post-office, and dispensary. The Church Missionary Society has an important station, and supports a considerable school. In time of flood, the whole strip of land between the town and the river is covered by the inundations. The town is traversed by two main b\u00e1z\u00e1rs running at right angles to each other, and intersected at the centre, which is the most crowded part, and is thronged with Povindah traders in the cold weather. Both the main b\u00e1z\u00e1rs are paved, and have been recently widened and provided with saucer-shaped drains along the main streets. The town itself is very well planned, though somewhat straggling. One specially good feature is the arrangement by which the Muhammadans and Hindus have each separate quarters; and hence quarrels between the rival religions are of rare occurrence. The native town is of quite modern construction, and contains but few buildings of interest. It is, however, one of the most aristocratic towns in the Punjab, with a large number of resident native noblemen, Path\u00e1ns, or Mul-\ntin\u00eds, including 4 Naw\u00e1bs. The old town was situated some four miles to the east of the present site, on the bank of the Indus. It stood in a large wood of date trees, and probably resembled the present town of Dera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n.\n\nThe trade of Dera Ism\u00e1\u00edl Kh\u00e1n ranks as of second-rate importance only, but some foreign traffic with Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n passes through in the course of transit. Povindah caravans of Afgh\u00e1n merchants traverse the town twice a year, on their road to and from India. Chief imports\u2014English and native piece-goods, hides, salt, and fancy wares; principal exports\u2014grain, wool, and ghi. Manufacture of scarves and inlaid wood-work. Municipal revenue in 1882\u201383, \u00a33511; municipal expenditure, \u00a33501; average incidence of taxation, 3s. 2d. per head of population within municipal limits.\n\nDeraj\u00e1t.\u2014Division or Commissionership in the Punjab, situated between 28\u00b0 27' and 33\u00b0 15' N. lat., and between 69\u00b0 35' and 72\u00b0 2' E., occupying the valley of the Indus; comprising the three Districts of Dera Ismail Khan, Dera Ghazi Khan, and Bannu, each of which see separately. Area, 17,681 square miles, with 1809 villages and 17 towns; number of houses, 204,557. Population, 1,137,572; namely, Muhammadans, 1,001,486; Hindus, 131,786; Sikhs, 3807; Jains, 62; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 13; Christians, 417; unspecified, 1. The J\u00e1ts, who comprise the most important section of the population, number 419,665, and are almost exclusively Muhammadans in religion. P\u00e1thans, all Muhammadans, come next, with 223,915; R\u00e1jputs, nearly all Muhammadans, number 7726; Br\u00e1hmans, 7740; Khattris, or Hindu landholders and traders, 7686; Shaikhs, 21,784; Mughals, 1930. The total area of the Division paying Government assessment amounts to 15,609 square miles, of which 3334 square miles were returned as cultivated in 1881, and 68,909 square miles as cultivable.\n\nDera N\u00e1nak.\u2014Town in Bat\u00e1la tahsil, Gurd\u00e1spur District, Punjab. Population (1881) 5956, namely, 1521 Hindus, 2409 Muhammadans, and 2026 Sikhs; number of houses, 1057. Lies in lat. 32\u00b0 2' 15\" N., long. 75\u00b0 4' E., on the banks of the river R\u00e1vi, 13 miles north-west of Bat\u00e1la. B\u00e1ba N\u00e1nak, the first Sikh Guru, settled and died at the village of Pakhoki, opposite the modern town; and his descendants, the Bedis, continued to reside upon the same spot until the encroaching river swept away their village. They then crossed the stream, and built a new town, which they called after the name of their holy ancestor. The majority of the inhabitants still consist of Bedis. Handsome Sikh temple, dedicated to B\u00e1ba N\u00e1nak. A second temple, known as the T\u00e1li S\u00e1hib, from a large t\u00e1l\u00ed or shisham tree which stood near it, was carried away by an inundation in 1870, but has since been rebuilt. The R\u00e1vi has encroached considerably towards the town; and\nalthough an embankment (bandh) has been constructed to check further encroachments, there is great danger of the temple and town itself being carried away. The introduction of railway communication has led to the decline of the commercial importance of the town; but it is still the centre of a considerable shawl-weaving industry. Considerable export of cotton and sugar. Police station, Anglo-vernacular school, post-office, and dispensary. Municipal revenue (1882\u201383), \u00a3531; expenditure, \u00a3425; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 9\u00bdd. per head.\n\n**Derapur.**\u2014South-western tahsil of Cawnpur District, North-Western Provinces; stretching inland from the banks of the Jumna, and traversed by the Bhognipur and Etawah branches of the Ganges Canal. Area, 321 square miles, of which 189 are cultivated; population (1881) 124,746; land revenue, \u00a327,798; total Government revenue, \u00a331,195; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a342,102; incidence of Government revenue, 3s. 3d. per acre. The river Sengur, flowing from west to east, divides the tahsil into two portions, the northern being a fertile loamy plain, watered by the canal and numerous wells. Towards the Sengur, however, this tract deteriorates, losing its fertility in rugged ravines. The southern portion has a soil much resembling that of the north, but with an almost complete lack of irrigation. The land between this depression and the Jumna is said to be the highest in the District.\n\n**Derapur.**\u2014Town in Cawnpur District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Derapur tahsil, situated on the right bank of the Sengur river, 35 miles west of Cawnpur town, and 8 miles south of Rura railway station, communication with which is maintained by means of a good metalled road. Population (1881) 2117; area of town site, 32 acres. The town possesses a tahsili, first-class police station, school, dispensary, post-office. It also contains the remains of several old mosques, and a fine masonry tank. In the time of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule (1756\u20131762), a fort was built here by Govind Rai Pandit, the Governor of the Province.\n\n**Derband.**\u2014Village in Haz\u00e1ra District, Punjab; situated in lat. 34\u00b0 18' N., long. 72\u00b0 55' E., on the left bank of the Indus, at the point where its stream expands on entering the plains. It is the principal village in the cis-Sutlej possessions of the Naw\u00e1b of Amb, which he holds under the British as landlord. Population (1881) 785. Near this point, in 1827, Sher Singh, the Sikh commander, defeated Sayyid Ahmad, an Afgh\u00e1n fanatic who had excited a religious war against the Sikhs.\n\n**Derdi J\u00e1nb\u00e1i.**\u2014Petty State in North K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency. It consists of 1 village with 2 tribute-payers. The revenue is estimated at \u00a3250.\nDeri Kot.\u2014Town in Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Ghaibi Dero.\n\nDeri Sh\u00e1han.\u2014Village in R\u00e1wal Pindi District, Punjab.\u2014See Dheri Shahan.\n\nDero Mohbat.\u2014T\u00e1luk of the Tando Sub-Division, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Latitude $24^\\circ 58' 15\"$ to $25^\\circ 19' N.$, and longitude $68^\\circ 32' 30\"$ to $69^\\circ 20' 45\"$ E. Area, 670 square miles. Population (1881) 37,260, namely, 35,35 Hindus, 30,528 Muhammadans, 740 Sikhs, and 2,457 aborigines; dwelling in 65 villages, and occupying 6741 houses. The t\u00e1luk contains 2 criminal courts; police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 5; regular police, 25 men; land revenue, \u00a35557.\n\nDetanaw.\u2014A small but once flourishing village in Twan-te township, Hanthawadi District, Pegu Division, British Burma. At the close of the first Anglo-Burmese war, many of the inhabitants who had sided with the British escaped to Tenasserim, but the rest were massacred by the Burmese for their adherence to our cause. In the neighbourhood, there are the ruins of a large and very ancient pagoda.\n\nDeulg\u00e1on R\u00e1j\u00e1 (Dewalg\u00e1on).\u2014Town in Buld\u00e1n\u00e1 District, Ber\u00e1r. Latitude $20^\\circ N.$, longitude $76^\\circ E.$ Population (1881) 7025, namely, 3,467 males and 3,558 females. Of the total population, 5,740 were returned as Hindus, 825 as Muhammadans, and 429 as Jains. The original name was Dewalw\u00e1ri, from a w\u00e1ri or hamlet close by, founded by a descendant of the J\u00e1don family. On the north is a small range of hills, and on the south the small river of Amni. The town is 60 miles east of Buld\u00e1n\u00e1. It was once fortified by a wall, now in ruins. The principal articles of trade are cotton and silk. There are about 240 Kosht\u00eds or weavers, of both sexes; and of S\u00e1l\u00eds or workers in silk and cotton, about 1,338. The Sr\u00e1waks or Jain traders, who deal in cloth, are said to have come from the north about 300 years ago. The origin of the great J\u00e1don family, a member of which founded Deulg\u00e1on, is uncertain. Lakhji J\u00e1don R\u00e1o, who came from Northern India, gave his daughter Jijia to Sh\u00e1hji the son of M\u00e1loj\u00ed; and in 1627 she became the mother of Sivaji, the founder of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 power. R\u00e1s\u00f3ji, a natural son of one of the J\u00e1don family, gained for himself the title of founder of Deulg\u00e1on, by enlarging the town. The hereditary dues enjoyed by the family were confiscated in 1851, when a body of Arabs under the command of B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o, then head of the family, engaged in a severe fight against the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d contingent. B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o died a State prisoner in 1856. Of all the dewasth\u00e1ns in Ber\u00e1r, that of B\u00e1l\u00e1j\u00ed at Deulg\u00e1on, founded by the J\u00e1don R\u00e1j\u00e1s, is the most celebrated. At the annual fair held generally in October in honour of this deity, the offerings exceed half a l\u00e1kh of rupees, or \u00a35000 in value.\nAt this time, food is supplied gratuitously to pilgrims and religious mendicants attending the festival.\n\n**Deulgh\u00e1t.**\u2014Town in Buld\u00e1n\u00e1 District, Ber\u00e1r; situated in latitude 20\u00b0 31' N., and longitude 76\u00b0 10' 30\" E., on the Penganga river. Population (1881) 3867. An ancient town, formerly known as Deoli, and perhaps built as a refuge in the troubled time of the Muhammadan invasions; now of little importance. The Hindu temples formerly existing were overthrown by the N\u00e1sir-ud-din, who was despatched by Aurangzeb to organize his conquests in the Deccan.\n\n**Dev\u00e1l\u00e1** (or **Nambalakod**).\u2014Chief town of the Nambalakod amshom (Division), South-east Wain\u00e1d (Wyn\u00e1d), Nilgiri District, Madras Presidency; situated 4 miles from the head of the Kark\u00far gh\u00e1t, on the high road traversing Wain\u00e1d to Vytheri, in latitude 11\u00b0 28' N., longitude 76\u00b0 26' E. The village has long been known as a coffee centre, but has increased of late greatly in importance, owing to its being the centre of the gold-fields of South-east Wain\u00e1d. It has a hotel, telegraph and police stations: the hills around are studded with bungalows inhabited by the European employ\u00e9s of the gold companies. Recently made the residence of the Head Assistant-Collector and Magistrate of Nilgiri District.\n\n**Devalgaon.**\u2014Town in Buld\u00e1n\u00e1 District, Ber\u00e1r.\u2014See **Deulgaon Raja**.\n\n**Dev\u00e1lia.**\u2014State in Rewa K\u00e1ntha, Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency.\u2014See **Dewalia**.\n\n**Devanhalli.**\u2014T\u00e1luk in Bangalore District, Mysore State, Southern India. Area, 238 square miles. Population (1881) 52,995, namely, 51,576 Hindus, 696 Muhammadans, and 723 Christians. Land revenue (1874\u201375), exclusive of water-rates, \u00a39748, or 3s. 3d. per cultivated acre. The t\u00e1luk is composed of the old Devanhalli and Jangamkot\u00e9 t\u00e1luks. The surface, watered by the Pin\u00e1kini, is undulating, with many fertile and well-cultivated valleys. There is some cultivation of the poppy for opium. Potatoes and nummelos of excellent quality are raised. Sugar of a superior kind was formerly manufactured under the supervision of some Chinese introduced by Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n. Vadi-genthalli in the t\u00e1luk is a considerable mart. The region is crossed from north to south by the old Bangalore\u2013Bellary high-road, and from east to west by the Kolar Dod\u2013Ballapur road.\n\n**Devanhalli.**\u2014Town in Bangalore District, Mysore State, Southern India; 23 miles north of Bangalore. Latitude 13\u00b0 15' N., longitude 77\u00b0 45' 30\" E. Population (1881) 5776, namely, 5464 Hindus, 296 Muhammadans, and 16 Christians. The former seat of a family of p\u00e1leg\u00e1rs, who traced their descent from one of the refugees of the Morasu Wokkal tribe, who founded petty dynasties throughout Mysore in the 14th century. The last of the Gaudas, as the chiefs were called,\nwas overthrown in 1748 by the Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mysore. It was in the siege of Devanhalli, on this occasion, that Haidar Al\u00ed first gained distinction as a volunteer horseman, and it was at Devanhalli that his son Tip\u00fa was born. Haidar erected a fort of stone, which was captured by Lord Cornwallis in 1791. A weekly fair held on Wednesdays is attended by 500 persons. Head-quarters of the Devanhalli t\u00e1luk.\n\nDevarayapalle.\u2014Village in the Atmak\u00far t\u00e1luk, Nellore District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 2466; number of houses, 466.\n\nDevaraydurga ('Hill of Deva R\u00e1j\u00e1').\u2014Fortified hill in Tumk\u00far District, Mysore State, Southern India. Latitude $13\u00b0\\ 22'\\ 30''$ N., longitude $77\u00b0\\ 14'\\ 50''$ E.; 9 miles east of Tumk\u00far; 3940 feet above sea-level. It consists of three terraces, well supplied with water, and is now used as a summer retreat for the European officials of the District. It was captured from a local chieftain in 1608 by Deva R\u00e1j\u00e1, who built the present fortification. A small temple on the summit, dedicated to Durg\u00e1 Narasinha, was erected by a subsequent R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mysore. It contains jewellery, etc., worth about \u00a31000, and is endowed with \u00a385 a year. An annual festival is attended by about 3000 persons.\n\nDevgadh (Deogarh).\u2014Sub-division of Ratn\u00e1giri District, Bombay Presidency. Bounded on the north by R\u00e1j\u00e1pur; on the east by the Kolh\u00e1pur State; on the south by the M\u00e1lvan Sub-division and the S\u00e1vantw\u00e1di State; and on the west by the Arabian Sea. Area, 543 square miles. Population (1881) 112,993, dwelling in 121 villages; density of population, 217 persons to the square mile. Males number 56,268; females, 61,631, or more than 50 per cent. Since 1872, the population has fallen off by 65,016. Distributed according to religion, Hindus number 112,993, or 95\u00b78 per cent.; Muhammadans, 3639; 'others,' not specified, 1267. The Devgadh Sub-division, about 26 miles long, and on an average 32 broad, stretches from the sea-coast to the watershed of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds. At the north-west corner the rocky headland of Vijayadurg juts out into the sea. The coast-line from Vijayadurg, the northern, to the mouth of the Achra river, the southern point, is fairly regular, although intersected by creeks and small river estuaries. In the sandy coves along the coast lie fishing villages picturesquely secluded in groves of palm. The only pass into the Deccan of any importance is the Phonda route; the water-supply is fair for 20 miles inland. The soil is poor, and there are no irrigation works. The river Vijayadurg is navigable for vessels drawing seven feet of water as far as Vaghotan. Canoes can paddle up to Kh\u00e1rep\u00e1tan, 20 miles from the sea. The area of the Sub-division has not been fully surveyed. Agricultural stock in 1878\u201379:\u2014Horned cattle, 69,478; sheep and goats, 7964; horses, 56; ploughs, 14,840. In 1878, 30,325 acres were cultivated, 80 per cent. of which was under rice, while 325\nacres were under sugar-cane. The Sub-division contains 7 civil and 2 criminal courts; police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 7; regular police, 62 men.\n\n**Devgadh** *(Deogarh).*\u2014Seaport in the Deogarh (Devgadh) Sub-division, Ratn\u00e1giri District, Bombay Presidency, 180 miles from Bombay. Has a safe and beautiful land-locked harbour, at all times perfectly smooth. Average depth of harbour, 18 feet. The entrance, only three cables in width, lies close to the fort point. The fort has an area of 120 acres; the walls are in a ruined state, and there is no garrison. The position, said to have been fortified by the Angri\u00e1s, a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 pirate race, 175 years ago, was in 1818 captured by Colonel Imlak. In 1875, the head-quarters of the Sub-division were moved here from Kh\u00e1rep\u00e1tan, and there are now the usual subordinate offices, a sea-customs office, a post-office, and a vernacular school. Lat. 16\u00b0 22' N., long. 73\u00b0 24' E.; average annual value of trade for five years ending 1881\u201382\u2014exports, \u00a310,945; imports, \u00a310,364.\n\n**Dev\u00ed** *(literally 'The Goddess,' a title specially applied to the wife of Siva, the All-Destroyer).* River in Orissa, Bengal; formed by the junction in Cuttack District of the Great and Little Dev\u00ed, two distributaries thrown off from the right bank of the K\u00e1tjuri, an important offshoot of the Mah\u00e1nadi. The united stream passes into Pur\u00ed District, and falls into the Bay of Bengal a few miles below the southern boundary of Cuttack. The Dev\u00ed forms the last part of the great network of channels into which the K\u00e1tjuri branch of the Mah\u00e1nadi bifurcates; most of these streams reunite as they approach the sea, forming a broad and noble estuary, which, under the name of the Dev\u00ed, enters the ocean in lat. 19\u00b0 58' N., and long. 86\u00b0 25' E. Some years ago, a permanent beacon was erected at the mouth; an excellent channel of from 16 to 24 feet is obtained for 7 miles inland from the entrance to the Dev\u00ed. Above this distance the river shoals rapidly, and is only navigable by country craft. This harbour is unfortunately rendered almost useless by bars of sand across its mouth, which vary in depth from year to year. As soon as the south-west monsoon sets in, the surf rages outside in such a way as to render the approach of vessels perilous in the extreme. The ordinary tidal rise is from 4 to 6 feet, and runs for 28 miles up the river, the limit of navigation in the dry season. After the rains, a much greater depth of water is obtained, and an extensive rice trade has developed itself at M\u00e1chhg\u00e1on, 9 miles up the Dev\u00ed. The mouth of the river is surrounded by dense jungle, destitute of inhabitants.\n\n**Devikota.**\u2014Town in Tiruvadanai t\u00e1luk or Sub-division, Madura District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 8451, namely, 7987 Hindus, 405 Muhammadans, and 59 Christians. Number of houses, 1255.\n\n**Devikota** *(Divikkottei).*\u2014Small ruined fort in Tanjore District,\nMadras Presidency; situated 24 miles north of Tranquebar, in latitude $11^\\circ 22' 28''$ N., and longitude $79^\\circ 52'$ E., on the Coromandel coast, at the mouth of the Coleroon (Kolladam) river. Devikota was one of the earliest settlements of the Company, the fort with a small tract of adjoining country having been wrested in 1749 from the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Tanjore, after two hazardous expeditions from Fort St. David. The first of these was undertaken at the instance of Saiy\u00e1ji, the deposed R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Devikota; it consisted of 430 Europeans and 1000 Sepoys under Captain Cope; but owing to various mischances, the force had to return. The second expedition of a larger body under Major S. Lawrence was successful. In the course of the siege, Clive, who was then a lieutenant, had a narrow escape. The fort was found to be a mile in circumference, with walls 18 feet high. No factory was established, and the fort was abandoned on the approach of the French in June 1758. The French in turn evacuated it after Sir Eyre Coote's victory at Wandewash, and in 1760 it was re-garrisoned by our troops.\n\n**Devjag\u00e1on (Devj\u00e1gan).**\u2014Place of Hindu pilgrimage in the J\u00e1m-b\u00fasar Sub-division, Broach District, Bombay Presidency; situated about three-quarters of a mile from the village of N\u00e1r\u00e1, at the mouth of the Dh\u00e1dhar river; contains about 300 houses. A fair attended by 2000 people is held here twice a year. The temple at Devjag\u00e1on is enclosed by a wall 80 feet from north to south, and 100 feet from east to west. The interior forms one room 25 feet by 18 feet. A grant of 1562 acres of land is attached to the temple. A lighthouse has been built on the mainland at the mouth of the Dh\u00e1dhar river; the height of the lantern above high water is 49 feet.\n\n**Dewa.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Naw\u00e1bganj tahsil, Bara Banki District, Oudh. At the time of the first Muhammedan invasion of Oudh, under Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1\u00fad, in 1030 A.D., this pargan\u00e1 appears to have been held by the Janw\u00e1r R\u00e1jputs; and the present Shaikh residents of Dewa assert that they are descended from Sh\u00e1h Wesh, the first Musalm\u00e1n conqueror of the village, and lieutenant of Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r. But for a long time it formed only their entrenched camp; they did not acquire any proprietary rights in the pargan\u00e1 till about the commencement of the 16th century, when aim\u00e1 grants were made to several Shaikh families. Another Musalm\u00e1n settlement is that of the Sayyids of Kheoli, who colonized a tract of 32 villages west of Dewa about the commencement of the 13th century. A third colony to the south is that of the Shaikhs of Kidw\u00e1ra, who probably came about the same time. Other smaller Musalm\u00e1n communities have also spread over the pargan\u00e1. The Bais Kshatriy\u00e1s also obtained a footing in the pargan\u00e1; and during the latter years of the native Government, they seized almost the whole of the north of the pargan\u00e1, by annexing the\nvillages of their weaker neighbours. They became the terror of the whole neighbourhood, and for a long time they set the King's Government at open defiance. Ultimately a strong force captured the fort of one of the chiefs, who was taken prisoner with his son, and beheaded at Lucknow. The other Janw\u00e1r chief was afterwards killed in battle. Both estates were confiscated and partitioned out, principally among Muhammadan Shaikhs. The percentage of cultivated land is higher than in any other pargan\u00e1 of the District, and south of Dewa the soil is very fertile and highly cultivated. Many of the husbandmen belong to the industrious class of Ah\u00edrs, who pay high rents to the Musalm\u00e1n proprietors. Area, 141 square miles, of which 82 are cultivated; Government land revenue, \u00a314,506, the average incidence being 5s. 6\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated area, 3s. 9d. per acre of assessed area, and 3s. 2\u00bdd. per acre of total area. Of the 163 villages which comprise the pargan\u00e1, only 57 are held by Hindus, the rest belong to Musalm\u00e1ns. Half the villages are held under talukd\u00e1ri, and half under zamind\u00e1ri tenure. Population in 1881, 64,846, namely, 33,787 males and 31,059 females; average density of population, 460 persons per square mile. Five towns only contain a population exceeding 1000; 4 unmetalled roads intersect the pargan\u00e1.\n\n**Dewa.**\u2014Town in Bara Banki District, Oudh; 8 miles from the town of Bara Banki. A Muhammadan colony of old standing, and the residence of two well-known families of Shaikhs. Population (1881) 2930. Noted for its manufactures of glassware and delf. Government school.\n\n**Dew\u00e1lia.**\u2014Small village in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces. Lat. 20\u00b0 6' N., and long. 79\u00b0 6' 30\" E.; 6 miles west of Bhandak. Population (1881) 595. Interesting on account of its architectural remains, for which see BHANDAK.\n\n**Dew\u00e1lgaon.**\u2014Small village in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces. Lat. 20\u00b0 23' N., and long. 80\u00b0 2' E.; 10 miles south-west of Wair\u00e1garh. Near it stands a remarkably-shaped hill, from which excellent iron-ore is quarried. Population (1881) 427.\n\n**Dewalgh\u00e1t.**\u2014Town in Buld\u00e1n\u00e1 District, Ber\u00e1r.\u2014See DEULGHAT.\n\n**Dew\u00e1l\u00eda.**\u2014Petty State in Jh\u00e1law\u00e1r pr\u00e1nth or division, K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, Bombay Presidency. It consists of 2 villages, with 2 tribute-payers. The revenue in 1881 was estimated at \u00a3523, of which \u00a346, 14s. is payable as British tribute and \u00a35, 12s. to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh.\n\n**Dew\u00e1lw\u00e1ra.**\u2014Small village in Wardh\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; on the river Wardh\u00e1, 6 miles west of Arvi. Noted for the large fair held every November for over a century past, in the bed of the river close by. The fair lasts from 20 to 25 days, during which time pilgrims and merchants from N\u00e1gpur, Poona, N\u00e1sik, Jabalpur (Jubbulpore), etc. flock to the fine temple of the goddess Rukm\u00ed, besides transacting\nbusiness to the value of \u00a310,000 or \u00a312,500. Immediately opposite Dew\u00e1lw\u00e1ra stood Kundinapur, described in the 10th chapter of the sacred book Bh\u00e1gvat as extending from the river Vidarbha (Wardha) to Amr\u00e1oti, where King Bhim\u00e1k reigned over the Vidarbha country, and gave his daughter in marriage to the god Krishna.\n\n**Dewalw\u00e1r\u00e1.**\u2014Village in Ellichpur District, Ber\u00e1r, Deccan; situated in lat. 21\u00b0 18' N., and long. 77\u00b0 45' E., on the P\u00farna river, about 14 miles from Ellichpur. Formerly a town of some importance, containing 5000 houses, but now only noteworthy for its ancient buildings, the chief of which are a mosque, built about 300 years ago, and 2 Hindu temples. One of these is dedicated to the Nar Singh of Hindu mythology, who, having killed H\u00edrania K\u00e1sip\u00fa, was able, after failing everywhere else, to wash away the blood-stains at Dewalw\u00e1r\u00e1. Near the temple is a place now called \u2018Kar Shudh\u00ed Tirth,\u2019 or \u2018holy place of cleaning hands.\u2019\n\n**Dew\u00e1s.**\u2014Native State under the Manpur Agency of Central India. Lat. 22\u00b0 42' to 23\u00b0 5' N., long. 75\u00b0 57' to 76\u00b0 21' E. Contains 2 towns and 455 villages. The chief products are grain, opium, sugar-cane, and cotton. The State has two chiefs, and the rule of each chief is distinct within his own limits. The elder chief, Kishnaj\u00ed R\u00e1o Pu\u00e1r, is commonly known as the B\u00e1b\u00e1 S\u00e1hib; the younger chief, N\u00e1r\u00e1yan R\u00e1o Pu\u00e1r, is styled D\u00e1d\u00e1 S\u00e1hib. They are of the Pu\u00e1r R\u00e1jput race, and of the same stock as the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Dh\u00e1r. Originally true R\u00e1jputs, they intermarried with Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and thus impaired the purity of their descent. The senior Branch keeps up a force of 87 horse and about 500 foot, including police, with 10 guns for saluting purposes. The junior Branch maintains a force of 123 horse and about 500 foot, including police. The Census return of 1881 gives a total population for the combined States of 142,162, and an area of 289 square miles. Of the total population, 75,647 are males, and 66,515 females. A total of 73,940 represents the portion subject to the senior Branch. In Dewas senior, Hindus number 64,496; Muhammadans, 7469; Jains, 118; and P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 4. Aborigines are returned at 1853. Of the Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans number 1742, and R\u00e1jputs 3797. In Dewas junior, Hindus number 58,891; Muhammadans, 6435; Jains, 40; and aborigines, 2856. Among the Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans number 3753, and R\u00e1jputs 9703. In the whole territory, 448 out of the 455 towns and villages have less than 1000 inhabitants. The territories of Dew\u00e1s, S\u00e1rangpur, and several other tracts were allotted by B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o Peshw\u00e1 to the common ancestor Kaluj\u00ed. His two sons, Tukaj\u00ed and Jiwa\u00ed, quarrelled, and the State was divided between them. By a treaty in 1818, with the two chiefs conjointly, the State was taken under British protection; the chiefs undertook to forego communication with other States, and to supply a body of contingent\ntroops, which was ultimately commuted for an annual cash payment of about \u00a33560. In 1828, the chiefs of Dew\u00e1s made over to the administrative charge of the British Government the pargan\u00e1 of Bagand, an outlying district in Nim\u00e1r. The annual surplus revenue of this pargan\u00e1, which in 1881-82 amounted to \u00a3662, after payment of all administrative charges, is paid to the chiefs of Dew\u00e1s. Both the chiefs, who hold the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1s, did good service during the Mutiny of 1857-58. Both have received sanads guaranteeing the right of adoption, and both are entitled to a salute of 15 guns.\n\n**Dew\u00e1s.**\u2014Chief town of the State of Dew\u00e1s, under the M\u00e1npur Agency of Central India, situated about 20 miles to the north-east of Indore. Lat. 22\u00b0 58' N., and long. 76\u00b0 6' E. The two chiefs of the State reside in different palaces within the town, which is of comparatively recent origin, and irregularly built; population (1881) 11,921 souls. The town contains a post-office, staging bungalow, and dispensary, all under British supervision. To the north-west of the town is a small conical hill, about 300 feet high, on which stands the temple of Ch\u00e1munda Dev\u00ed, which is reached by a half-finished flight of masonry steps. The temple near the crest consists of a demi-spherical vault or cave cut in the side of a cliff, having a huge figure of the goddess brought out in relief. In front of the cavity is a small masonry room with steps descending to the level of an open space cleared out on the crest of the hill, on one side of which is a rectangular tank, with a small temple dedicated to Mah\u00e1deo, built on its edge; the hill is visited by numerous devotees from the town and surrounding country.\n\n**Dhabien.**\u2014Tidal creek in Hanthawadi District, Pegu Division, British Burma.\u2014See DABIEN.\n\n**Dhabla Dh\u00edr.**\u2014Guaranteed girasi\u00e1, or petty chiefship, under the Bhop\u00e1l Agency of Central India. Area, 10 square miles; estimated population, 1000 souls. The Th\u00e1kur, or chief, receives a tankha, or pecuniary allowance in lieu of rights over land, from Holk\u00e1r, Sindhia, Dew\u00e1s, and Bhop\u00e1l to the total amount of \u00a3425. In addition, he holds a grant of 3 villages in Shuj\u00e1walpur, under the guarantee of the British Government, for which he pays a quit-rent of \u00a3140 annually. He is also Th\u00e1kur of Kankerkhera, in which right he holds another village in Shuj\u00e1walpur, receiving a tankha of \u00a380, and paying an additional quit-rent of \u00a317, subject to a deduction of 2 per cent. on the transfer of the pargan\u00e1 to Sindhia.\n\n**Dhabla Ghosi.**\u2014Guaranteed girasi\u00e1, or petty chiefship, under the Bhop\u00e1l Agency of Central India. The Th\u00e1kur, or chief, receives a tankha\u2014pecuniary allowance in lieu of rights over land\u2014from Sindhia, Dew\u00e1s, and Bhop\u00e1l to the total amount of \u00a3500. He also holds a village in Shuj\u00e1walpur, for which he pays a quit-rent of \u00a3105.\n\n**Dh\u00e1dhar.**\u2014River in Western India: rises in the western spurs\nof the Vindhya range, about 35 miles north-east of the village of Bhil\u00e1pur, where it is crossed by a stone bridge, and in lat. $22^\\circ 20' N.$, and long. $73^\\circ 40' E.$, and after receiving on the right the Vishwamitri river, on the banks of which stands the city of Baroda, ultimately falls into the Gulf of Cambay, in lat. $21^\\circ 54' N.$, and long. $72^\\circ 38' E.$ Total length, 70 miles; drainage area estimated at 1850 square miles.\n\n**Dh\u00e1k\u00e1.** \u2014 Division, District, and city of Eastern Bengal.\u2014See Dacca.\n\n**Dhalandhar.** \u2014 Village in the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal. Contains a native asylum for lunatics. The daily average number of inmates in 1881 was 207, 27.57 per cent. of whom were discharged as cured, and 7.73 per cent. as improved. The deaths amounted to 15.96 per cent.\n\n**Dhaldighi.** \u2014 Village and large tank in Din\u00e1jpur District, Bengal. Fair held annually on the bank of the tank, which lasts for eight days, commencing on the first day of Ph\u00e1lgun (latter half of February); attendance, about 25,000. Considerable trade carried on at this time.\n\n**Dhaleswari.** \u2014 The name of several rivers in Eastern Bengal and Assam: (1) an offshoot of the Jamun\u00e1, or main stream of the Brahmaputra, which runs across Dacca District and forms a valuable communication with the Meghn\u00e1, although the quantity of water now (1882) coming into it from the Jamun\u00e1 is decreasing rapidly, and steamers only run during the rainy season; (2) the stream formed by the junction of the Surm\u00e1 and Kusi\u00e1ra rivers before its confluence with the Meghn\u00e1, forming the boundary between the Districts of Maimansinh and Sylhet; (3) a river in Cachar District, rising in the Lush\u00e1i country, and flowing northwards into the Bar\u00e1k through the fertile valley of Hail\u00e1k\u00e1nd\u00ed. At the point where it crosses the frontier, a permanent b\u00e1z\u00e1r has been established for trade with the Lush\u00e1is. In the lower part of its course, the stream has been diverted by an embankment, said to have been constructed by a R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Cachar. The old channel reaches the Bar\u00e1k at Si\u00e1ltekh B\u00e1z\u00e1r; the new channel, called the K\u00e1t\u00e1kh\u00e1l, is navigable by large boats. This river has given its name to a forest reserve covering an area of 33 square miles.\n\n**Dhalet.** \u2014 River in Kyauk-py\u00fa District, Arakan Division, British Burma. Rises in the main range and falls into Combermere Bay; it is navigable as far as Dhalet (sometimes called Talak), a village 25 miles from its mouth. In its upper reaches the stream is a mountain torrent, only passable by small canoes.\n\n**Dhalkisor** (or *Dwarkeswar*). \u2014 River of Western Bengal. It rises in the Til\u00e1bani Hill in M\u00e1nbh\u00fam District, whence it flows through B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 District, following a tortuous south-easterly course, with several bifurcations through th\u00e1n\u00e1s B\u00e1nkur\u00e1, Onda, Bishenpur, Kotalpur, and Ind\u00e1s. It enters Bardw\u00e1n District 4 miles east of Katalpur; flows\nsouth-east and south past the town of Jah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d, and leaves the District at Ber\u00e1r\u00ed village, after which it is known as the Rupnarayan, eventually joining the H\u00fagl\u00ed opposite H\u00fagl\u00ed Point. It is subject to sudden floods, but portions of the bordering country are now protected from inundation by embankments. In its upper reaches, within B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 District, it is only navigable in the rainy months by craft of 2 tons burthen.\n\n**Dhamda.**\u2014Town in Ra\u00edpur District, Central Provinces. Lat. $21^\\circ 27'$ N., long. $81^\\circ 23'$ E.; about 24 miles north-west of Ra\u00edpur. Population (1881) 2850, namely, Hindus, 2593; Kabirpanth\u00eds, 24; Satn\u00e1m\u00ed, 1; Muhammadans, 172; and persons professing aboriginal religions, 60. The inhabitants include a colony of brass-workers, who manufacture the heavy brass anklets worn by the women of the country. Near the town are fine groves, and the remains of some large tanks, and of an old fort, with two handsome gateways in good preservation. Dhamd\u00e1 was formerly the head-quarters of a Gond chief, subordinate to the kings of Ratanpur. On the conquest of Chhatisgarh by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, their officers arrested the chief of Dhamd\u00e1 on a charge of treachery, and blew him from a gun. Dhamd\u00e1 has a school, a post-office, and police station-house.\n\n**Dh\u00e1mi.**\u2014One of the Punjab Hill States under the Government of the Punjab, about 10 or 12 miles to the west of Simla. When Shahab-ud-din Ghori (Muhammad of Ghor) invaded India in the 14th century, the founder of this family fled from Ra\u00edpur, in Amb\u00e1la (Umballa) District, and conquered the territory which now forms the State of Dh\u00e1mi. It was at one time a feudatory of Bil\u00e1spur, but was made independent of that State by the British Government when the G\u00farkhas, having overrun the country from 1803 to 1815, were finally expelled in the latter year. Fateh Singh, the R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Dh\u00e1mi, is a R\u00e1jput by caste. The area of the State (1881) is 26 square miles; with 214 hamlets and 688 houses. Population (1881) 3322, namely, 3294 Hindus, 3 Sikhs, and 25 Muhammadans. Estimated revenue, \u00a3800. The State pays an annual tribute of \u00a372. The father of the present chief paid only \u00a336, one-half of the tribute having been remitted for his life on account of good services rendered during the Mutiny. The principal articles of production are grains and a little opium.\n\n**Dham-ma-tha.**\u2014Town in Amherst District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma.\u2014See DAM-MA-THA.\n\n**Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed.**\u2014Village in S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) District, Central Provinces. Lat. $24^\\circ 12'$ N., long. $78^\\circ 49'$ E.; 28 miles north of S\u00e1g\u00e1r town. S\u00farat S\u00e1h, a scion of the great Gond dynasty of Mandl\u00e1, the original founder of Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed, was defeated about 1600 by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Barsingh Deva, the Bundel\u00e1 chief of the neighbouring State of Orchh\u00e1, who took possession of\nthe country, and rebuilt the fort and town on so grand a scale that it became the capital of a large tract with 2558 villages, including the greater part of the present Districts of S\u00e1gar and Damoh. His son and successor, Pah\u00e1r Singh, continued to reign till 1619, when the country became an integral portion of the Delhi Empire. During the next eighty years it was ruled by five successive governors from Delhi, the last of whom was, about 1700, defeated by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chhatar S\u00e1l of Pann\u00e1. His descendants retained Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed till 1802, when Umr\u00e1o Singh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Patan, a small neighbouring place, seized the fort and country by treachery, but was himself in a few months compelled to yield to the army of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur. In 1818, soon after the flight of Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, the fort was invested by a British force under General Marshall; who, having ineffectually offered the garrison \u00a31000 'in discharge of arrears of pay, on condition of immediate evacuation,' opened batteries against the place, with such effect that in six hours it was surrendered unconditionally. Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed thus came under British rule, but by that time the tract had been reduced to only 33 villages. Its present condition is desolate in the extreme, the population scarcely exceeding 100; but the ruins of mosques, tombs, and buildings for nearly a mile round the fort and lake attest the importance of the place under Muhammadan rule. The fort, which covers an area of 52 acres, stands on an eminence near the summit of the gh\u00e1ts leading to Bundelkhand, commanding the valley of the river Dh\u00e1s\u00e1n. The ramparts are in most parts 50 feet high and 15 feet thick, with enormous round towers. Interior works further strengthen the defences of the eastern quarter, where the magazine was probably situated. Inside and around it are large groves of custard-apple trees. The town lies to the west of the fort, and the lake, which is of considerable size, to the south-west of the town. The supply of water is excellent, and the soil near the village remarkably fertile, as the luxuriant and varied vegetation shows. Police outpost station.\n\n**Dh\u00e1mpur.**\u2014Tahsil of Bijnaur (Bijnor) District, North-Western Provinces. Area, 323 square miles, of which 223 are cultivated. Population (1881) 170,039; land revenue, \u00a326,630; total Government revenue, \u00a329,905; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a358,100; incidence of Government revenue, 2s. 7d. per acre. The tahsil contained in 1883, 1 civil and 2 criminal courts, with 4 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 67 men, besides 61 municipal and town police, and 468 village watchmen and road patrols.\n\n**Dh\u00e1mpur.**\u2014Town in Bijnaur (Bijnor) District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of the Dh\u00e1mpur tahsil, situated in lat. 29\u00b0 18' 43\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 32' 46\" E. Lies on the road from Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d to Hardw\u00e1r, 24 miles east of Bijnaur. Population (1881) 5708, namely, Hindus, 3457; Muhammadans, 2121; and Jains, 130;\narea of town site, 83 acres. Total municipal income (1883), \u00a3433, of which \u00a3288 was derived from octroi; average incidence of taxation, 11\u00bdd. per head. A small but wealthy and well-built town, described by the Sanitary Commissioner in 1876 as 'one of the best-looking small towns in the Province\u2014a town of brick-paved public ways admirably kept in cleanliness.' The main street or bazar is a wide and busy thoroughfare, lined with handsome shops, chiefly those of dealers in ironware. The ironsmiths and braziers are noted for the manufacture of iron locks and plates, brass candlesticks and ornaments for native carriages, and gongs and bells of mixed copper and lead. Handsome matchlocks are also made, and a local gunsmith obtained a prize of 750 francs for two specimens sent to the Paris Exhibition in 1867. Markets are held twice a week, and there is a monthly fair. The town is aired by several open places containing fine old trees. To the north stand the tahsil buildings, and to the south a native inn (sarai). The other public buildings are a first-class police station, post-office, and tahsil school. The only events of importance in the history of the town are the defeat here of the Mughal forces by the Rohill\u00e1s, about 1750; its pillage by the Pindaris under Amir Khan in 1805; and the attempted plunder of its treasury during the Mutiny of 1857.\n\nDh\u00e1mr\u00e1.\u2014River and estuary in Bengal, formed by the combined waters of the Brahmani and Baitarani and their tributaries, which enter the Bay of Bengal in lat. 20\u00b0 47' N., and long. 87\u00b0 E. The Dh\u00e1mr\u00e1 is a fine navigable river, but rendered dangerous by a bar across its mouth. It forms the boundary line between the Districts of Cuttack and Balasor, but lies within the jurisdiction of the latter; the entrance is marked by the Kanik\u00e1 buoy in 21 feet reduced, and by Shortt's tripod beacon, on the extreme north-east dry portion of Point Palmyras Reef. Since 1866, a second outer channel, with 10 feet at lowest tide, has opened about a mile to the south. The inner bar is constantly shifting. In 1859, 12 feet of water were found here; in 1866, only 3; and in 1870, 8. The water in the Dh\u00e1mr\u00e1 estuary rapidly shoals from a minimum depth of 21 feet at the Kanik\u00e1 buoy to 6 feet on the Central Sand. Within the southern outer channel (minimum depth, 10 feet at low tide) vessels are absolutely sheltered from the monsoon. The Survey Report (dated May 13, 1870) returns the tidal range of the Dh\u00e1mr\u00e1 at 10 feet, with variations from a minimum of 6 feet 10 inches to a maximum of 10\u00bd feet. Brigs and Madras traders drawing from 10 to even 18 feet frequent the harbour of the Dh\u00e1mr\u00e1, which was declared a port in 1858, with perfect safety.\n\nDh\u00e1mr\u00e1.\u2014Port in the estuary of the same name, Cuttack District, Bengal. Lat. 20\u00b0 47' 40\" N., long. 86\u00b0 55' 55\" E. The name is applied to the navigable channels of the rivers forming the Dh\u00e1mra, as far as\nthey are affected by tidal waters. These limits embrace Ch\u00e1ndb\u00e1l\u00ed, on the Baitaran\u00ed, a seat of coasting steamer traffic, and a rapidly rising town; Hansu\u00e1, on the Br\u00e1hman\u00ed, formerly a great salt emporium; P\u00e1t\u00e1mund\u00e1i, on the same river; and Aul, on the Kharsu\u00e1,\u2014the three last within Cuttack District. The trade of Ch\u00e1ndb\u00e1l\u00ed is mainly steamer traffic, monopolizing almost entirely the import and export trade of Balasor District. The rest of the trade of Dh\u00e1mr\u00e1 port is carried on exclusively in sailing ships, and consists chiefly in the export of rice. The eastern boundary of the port is the Dh\u00e1mr\u00e1 customs station.\n\n**Dhamsia.**\u2014Estate of the S\u00e1nkheda Mew\u00e1s, Rewa K\u00e1ntha, Gujar\u00e1t (Cuzer\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency.

Police station, post-office, and two schools. D\u00e9p\u00f4t of sugar trade.\n\n**Dhanauti.** \u2014 River in Champ\u00e1r\u00e1n District, Bengal. Formerly a branch of the L\u00e1l Beg\u00ed, a bifurcation of the Lower Harha, a tributary of the Gandak. It is 113 miles long, but has now quite silted up in its upper parts, and for many years has received no flood discharge. It ultimately falls into the Sikhren\u00e1, near S\u00edt\u00e1k\u00fand. A large iron railway bridge of 220 feet span crosses this river near Motih\u00e1ri town.\n\n**Dhandh\u00faka.** \u2014 Sub-division of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bombay Presidency. It is bounded on the north, west, and south by K\u00e1thi\u00e1-w\u00e1r; on the east by the Gulf of Cambay. Area, 1098 square miles. Population (1881) 123,107, namely, 64,003 males and 59,104 females; density of population, 112 persons per square mile. Since 1872 the population has fallen off by 1753. Classified according to religion, Hindus number 103,606, or 84 per cent. of the whole population; Muhammadans number 12,362; \u2018others\u2019 not specified, 7139. The surface of the Sub-division is an open, treeless, black-soil plain, sloping gently towards the Gulf of Cambay. In the west is a tract of bare hills and rough valleys with millet fields and garden patches. Cotton is grown in the centre and wheat in the east. The water-supply is scanty. There are no large rivers. The streams of the Bh\u00e1dhar and the Ut\u00e1vli lose themselves in marshes. Wells are few, and irrigation limited. In 1877, there were 800 wells, 170 ponds or reservoirs, and 22 streams and springs. The climate is trying, except in the cold season. Rainfall varies from 16 to 24 inches yearly. In the year of the Bombay Settlement for thirty years (1857\u201358), for the Sub-division there were 140 holdings, with an average area of 30 acres, paying an average rent of \u00a32, 4s. 9d. In 1877, there were 339,804 acres of land under cultivation, of which 27 per cent. was fallow or under grass. There are 2 towns and 139 villages. The Sub-division has 1 civil and 3 criminal courts; police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 2; regular police, 126 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 558. Land revenue, \u00a323,089.\n\n**Dhandh\u00faka.** \u2014 Chief town of the Dhandh\u00faka Sub-division, Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bombay Presidency, situated on the right bank of Bh\u00e1dhar. Lat. 22\u00b0 21' 15\" N., long. 72\u00b0 2' 20\" E., 62 miles south-west of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d and 100 miles north-west of Surat. Population (1881) 10,044; municipal revenue (1882\u201383), \u00a3769; rate of taxation, 1s. 3\u00bdd. per head. The town lies in an open plain, exposed to the burning winds of the hot season. Water-supply extremely bad. Borahs form a large class of the population. Coarse cloth, pottery, and carpenter\u2019s\nwork are the chief industries. There are 5 Government schools, one of them for girls. Together with Dholka, the town was ceded to the British in 1802. Dhandh\u00faka, which is a place of some antiquity, has a sub-judge's court, post-office, dispensary, and traveller's bungalow.\n\n**Dhaneswari (Dhansiri).** \u2014 River of Assam, rising under Sama-guting in the northern spurs of the B\u00e1rel mountains, which form the watershed between the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills and Cachar; in lat. 25\u00b0 20' N., and long. 93\u00b0 24' E. Its course through the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills District is on the whole northerly, through a vast plain of heavy jungle known as the N\u00e1mbur forest, amid which are to be seen the ruins of Dim\u00e1pur, until it is joined by the Dayang. The combined stream then turns towards the north-east, and finds its way after many windings into the Brahmaputra, near the village of Bagdw\u00e1r Ch\u00e1pari, in lat. 26\u00b0 44' N., and long. 93\u00b0 42' E. The only important place on its banks is Gol\u00e1gh\u00e1t, in Sibs\u00e1gar District, which is a centre of trade for the N\u00e1g\u00e1 tribes. Up to this point it is navigable by steamers during the rainy season, but small boats can proceed as high as Dim\u00e1pur in the cold weather, and boats of about 4 tons burthen can reach the same place in the rains.\n\n**Dhang\u00e1in.** \u2014 Pass in Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh District, Bengal; by which the Old Trunk Road to Shergh\u00e1ti left the upper plateau for the lower level. Lat. 24\u00b0 23' 30\" N., and long. 84\u00b0 59' 45\" E. It is now impracticable for wheeled traffic, and has fallen into disuse.\n\n**Dh\u00e1ng\u00e1on.** \u2014 Guaranteed Th\u00e1kurate, or petty chiefship, in Central India, under the jurisdiction of the Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces. The Th\u00e1kur or Chief receives an allowance of \u00a3148 from Sindhia, and \u00a35, 12s. from Holkar. He pays to the British Government a tribute of \u00a3100.\n\n**Dh\u00e1n\u00edkhola.** \u2014 Town in Maimansingh District, Bengal, in lat. 24\u00b0 30' 10\" N., long. 90\u00b0 24' 11\" E. Situated on the Satu\u00e1 river, an insignificant stream, about 12 miles from Nasir\u00e1b\u00e1d, the head-quarters town.\n\n**Dhanori.** \u2014 Village in Aro\u00ed tahsil, Wardh\u00e1 District, Central Provinces, situated about 26 miles north-west of Wardh\u00e1 town. Population about 1000, principally cultivators, with some dyers and weavers. Village school and police outpost station. Small weekly market, held on Fridays.\n\n**Dhansiri.** \u2014 River of Assam. \u2014 See Dhaneswari.\n\n**Dhanu.** \u2014 River in the south-east of Maimansingh District, Bengal, which falls into the Meghn\u00e1. Navigable by boats of all sizes throughout the year. It contains fish in abundance.\n\n**Dhan\u00far.** \u2014 Lake in Sirsa District, Punjab. One of the series of shallow basins of alluvial clay which, connected by short defined channels, form the lower course of the Ghaggar. It is about 3 miles long by 1 broad, but often dries up in the hot weather. The water is\nlargely used for rice irrigation, being drawn off by long irrigation cuts to the villages lower down. The deepening of the exit channel by erosion has gradually reduced the overflow from which it is fed, and the irrigation has somewhat fallen off of late years in consequence.\n\n**Dhan\u00fat Bh\u00fara-gy\u00ed.**\u2014A vast pagoda, now in ruins, in the Angy\u00ed township, Hanthawadi District, Pegu Division, British Burma.\u2014See DANUT-PAYA-GYI.\n\n**Dh\u00e1ola Dhar.**\u2014Mountain chain in K\u00e1ngra District, Punjab; formed by a projecting fork of the outer Him\u00e1layan range, marking the boundary between the K\u00e1ngra valley and Chamba. The main system here rises steeply from the lowlands at its base, unbroken by any minor hills, to an elevation of 13,000 feet above the valley beneath. The chain is formed by a mass of granite, which has forced its way through the superincumbent sedimentary rocks, and crowns the summit with its intrusive pyramidal crests, too precipitous for the snow to find a lodging. Below, the waste of snow-fields is succeeded by a belt of pines, giving way to oaks as the flanks are descended, and finally merging into a cultivated vale watered by perennial streams. The highest peak attains an elevation of 15,956 feet above sea-level; while the valley has a general height of about 2000 feet.\n\n**Dh\u00e1pew\u00e1r\u00e1.**\u2014A clean and healthy town in N\u00e1gpur District, Central Provinces, on either side of the river Chandrabh\u00e1g\u00e1, in a fertile plain. Situated in lat. 21\u00b0 18' N., and long. 78\u00b0 57' E., 20 miles north-west of N\u00e1gpur. Population (1881) 3666, namely, Hindus, 3455; Muham-madans, 197; and Jains, 14. The inhabitants are chiefly Kosht\u00eds, employed in the manufacture of cotton cloth, of which industry Dh\u00e1pe-w\u00e1r\u00e1 was one of the earliest seats in the District. The fort, now dilapidated, was built for protection against the Pind\u00e1ris about seventy-five years ago. Seat of an honorary magistrate's court.\n\n**Dh\u00e1r.**\u2014Native State under the Bh\u00edl (Bheel) or Bhop\u00e1war Agency, Central India; situated between 22\u00b0 1' and 23\u00b0 8' N. lat., and between 74\u00b0 43' and 75\u00b0 35' E. long. Bounded on the north by Rutlam Native State, on the east by Sindhia's tracts of Barnagar, Ujjain and Dikth\u00e1n, and by Indore; on the south by the Narbad\u00e1; and on the west by the State of Jhabua and Sindhia's district of Amjhera. The Dh\u00e1r \u0160tate is divided, for judicial and revenue purposes, into seven pargan\u00e1s, namely, Dh\u00e1r, Badn\u00e1war, Nalcha, Dh\u00e1rampuri, K\u00faksi, T\u00edkr\u00ed, and N\u00edmanpur-Mukrar, the last being a desolate outlying pargan\u00e1 resting on the Narbad\u00e1, and separated from the remainder of the State by the whole breadth of Indore. Feudatories of the Dh\u00e1r State are the following R\u00e1jput chiefs and nobles who hold their lands under the guarantee of the British Government, and pay tribute or tankha to the State, namely, Mult\u00e1n, Kachhi-Baroda, Dhotria, Badwal, Bakhtgarh, Kod, Katodia, Manglia, Dharsikhera, Bairsia, Murwadia, and Panah; also the following Bh\u00famia or Bh\u00edl and\nBhil\u00e1l\u00e1 chiefs residing principally in the Dh\u00e1rampuri and Nalcha parg\u00e1n\u00e1s, namely, Mota-Barkhera, Chota-Barkhera, Nimkhera, Kali-Baori, Garhi, Jamnia (who pays tribute for the village of D\u00e1bir) and R\u00e1jgarh. The former chiefs or th\u00e1kurs have the exclusive management of their own lands, which, however, does not extend to a power of life and death; and all their subjects have the right of appeal to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Dh\u00e1r, who exercises general supremacy, the chiefs yielding him service and allegiance. This arrangement was due to Sir John Malcolm. The Bh\u00fami\u00e1s and Bhil\u00e1l\u00e1 chiefs have far less power than the th\u00e1kurs, and are responsible for indemnifying all robberies occurring within their limits, and also for the general peace of their part of the country.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The only river of any size actually in the Dh\u00e1r State is the Chamla, a tributary of the Chambal, which latter runs for a short distance through the east corner of the Dh\u00e1r parg\u00e1n\u00e1. At Khal there is a fair-weather trestle bridge over the Narbad\u00e1, and a ferry at the same place in the rains. Rivers of minor importance are the Maun, with a course of 35 miles, the Kar\u00fam, with a course of 24 miles, and the B\u00e1ngn\u00ed, all of them dry for the most part during the warm season, but becoming torrents in the rains. The Vindhyas, with an elevation here of from 1600 to 1700 feet above the Narbad\u00e1 valley, runs across the southern portion of the State. Numerous passes lead through the range to the plain below; but with the exception of two, the Golpura and the Bar\u00fadpura, they are all difficult and unsuited for wheeled carriage. Among the wild animals are the tiger, leopard, bear, wild hog, and deer of various kinds. Iron ore of good quality exists all along the hills, but is nowhere worked. Above the Vindhyas the climate is mild, the nights always cool, and the hot season of short duration; but below the gh\u00e1ts, the heat is sometimes excessive. At the close of the rains fever is very prevalent, and guinea-worm is very common in the State. The mean annual rainfall for the five years ending 1881 was 33 inches. Nearly every variety of grain is grown in the fertile lands above the gh\u00e1ts. About one-third of the wheat and gram crop is exported. A large quantity of opium, sugar-cane, cotton, tobacco, linseed, and turmeric is also produced. The principal roads through the State are the Indore and Gujar\u00e1t postal line, via Sard\u00e1rpur, and on to Dohud in Gujar\u00e1t; the road to D\u00fadi from Ratlam, along which route much opium passes; and 67 miles of the new road from Mhow to Nas\u00edrabad. Various minor roads lead from the capital of the State to the surrounding country.\n\nHistory.\u2014The present R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Dh\u00e1r, Anand R\u00e1o Pu\u00e1r, K.C.S.I., who was born about 1843, is a Pu\u00e1r R\u00e1jp\u00fat. The annals of his State are part of the general annals of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, the towns of Ujjain and Dh\u00e1r at one period or another supplying a capital for the legendary Hindu\ndynasties of the region. Early story assigns to the Pu\u00e1rs a sovereignty lasting more than a thousand years, and dating from a period long anterior to the Christian era. Among the semi-mythical Pu\u00e1rs, the names of Vikram\u00e1ditya (claimed as an ancestor by the present chief of Dh\u00e1r) and R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bhoj are given special prominence. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bhoj is said to have transferred the capital from Ujjain to Dh\u00e1r. About 500 A.D., as the tradition runs, the Pu\u00e1rs\u2019 power declined before the rise of one R\u00e1jput house after another; and about this time the family is supposed to have made their way to P\u00fana (Poona), in the Deccan. The true historical period, in M\u00e1lw\u00e1 as in the greater part of India, commences with the consolidation of the Muhammadan power towards the end of the 14th century. In 1398, Dil\u00e1wan Kh\u00e1n came as governor from Delhi, and with the materials of the great Hindu temples of Dh\u00e1r built mosques for the followers of Isl\u00e1m. Dil\u00e1wan\u2019s son, who succeeded his father as viceroy, transferred the capital from Dh\u00e1r to Mand\u00fa. And from the time of Akbar\u2019s visit in 1567, not long after the transfer, until the ascendancy of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the Dh\u00e1r State became an insignificant part of a province of the Delhi Empire.\n\nThe Pu\u00e1rs who migrated to the Deccan eventually supplied some of their most distinguished commanders to the great Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 leader Sivaji and his warlike successors. The present Dh\u00e1r dynasty was founded by Anand R\u00e1o, who in 1749 received the grant of Dh\u00e1r from B\u00e1ji R\u00e1o Peshw\u00e1. For twenty years before the British conquest of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, Dh\u00e1r was subjected to a series of spoliations by Sindhia and Holkar, and was preserved from destruction only by the talents and courage of M\u00edna B\u00e1\u00ed, widow of Anand R\u00e1o II. and adoptive mother of R\u00e1mchandra Pu\u00e1r, the fifth in descent from the founder of the family. R\u00e1mchandra Pu\u00e1r was succeeded by his adopted son, Jeswant R\u00e1o, who died in 1857, and was succeeded by his half-brother, Anand R\u00e1o, the present R\u00e1j\u00e1. The State was confiscated for rebellion in 1857, but subsequently restored to Anand R\u00e1o (then a minor), with the exception of the District of Bairsia, which was granted to the Sekandar Begam of Bhop\u00e1l.\n\nThe area of the State is 1740 square miles. The population in 1881 was returned at 149,244, namely, 115,051 Hindus, 12,269 Muhammadans, 3087 Jains, 12 P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 27 Christians, and 18,798 \u2018aborigines.\u2019 The principal castes found in Dh\u00e1r are R\u00e1jputs, Kanbis, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Bhils, and Bhil\u00e1l\u00e1s. The revenue is \u00a374,312. By the treaty of January 1819, Dh\u00e1r was taken under British protection. The State pays a contribution of \u00a31965 to the M\u00e1lw\u00e1 Bhil corps. The military force consists of 276 cavalry and about 800 infantry, including police, 2 guns, and 21 artillerymen. The chief has received a sanad of adoption, and is entitled to a salute of 15 guns. There is 1 English\nschool and 18 vernacular schools, 2 dispensaries and a new hospital recently built by the R\u00e1j\u00e1.\n\n**Dh\u00e1r.**\u2014Chief town of Dh\u00e1r State under the Bhil or Bhop\u00e1war Agency of Central India; situated in lat. $23^\\circ 36' N.$, and long. $75^\\circ 4' E.$, on the route from Mau (Mhow) to Baroda, 33 miles west of the former and 183 miles east of the latter. The present town is nearly $1\\frac{1}{4}$ miles in length and half a mile in breadth, surrounded by a mud wall, and contains many striking buildings, especially two large decayed mosques built of red stone. Water is abundant, being supplied from two small and eight large tanks. A fort, built of red stone, is situated outside the town on an eminence 40 feet above the plain, and is surrounded by a rampart 30 to 35 feet high, with 24 round and 2 square towers, on the larger of which last stands the palace of the chief. The gate is on the western face, and is defended by an octagonal tower. The fort was the scene of operations of a British force under General Stewart in 1857. Elevation of the town above the sea, 1908 feet. Population (1881) 15,224, namely, Hindus, 11,858; Muhammadans, 2,832; 'others,' 534. Post-office, dispensary, and opium weighing-machine under European supervision.\n\n**Dh\u00e1r\u00e1kot.**\u2014Zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri or estate, 8 miles north-west of Aska, on the Rishikulya river, in Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency. Area, 125 square miles; number of villages, 188; population (1881) 31,691. The estate is divided into 3 sub-divisions \u2014 Jahada mut\u00e1, with 85 villages; Kunanogodo mut\u00e1, with 37 villages; and Sahasrango mut\u00e1, with 66 villages. *Peshkash*, or quit-rent, payable to Government, \u00a32,496. With the neighbouring divisions of Sur\u00e1da, Bodogoda, and Sergada, Dh\u00e1r\u00e1kot formed part of the ancient estate of Khidsinghi, constituted by the Gajapati sovereigns of Orissa in the 12th century. In 1476, the Khidsinghi family divided their property into four baronies, of which Dh\u00e1r\u00e1kot is one.\n\n**Dharamkota.**\u2014Shrine in Kistna District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See AMRAVATI (*Amraoti*).\n\n**Dharampur.**\u2014Native State within the Political Agency of Surat, Province of Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency. Bounded on the north by the Chikhli Sub-division of Surat District and the State of B\u00e1nsda; on the east by the State of Surg\u00e1n\u00e1 and the D\u00e1ngs; on the south by the State of Peint; and on the west by the Bals\u00e1r and P\u00e1rdi Sub-divisions of Surat District. The territory is 40 miles long from north to south, and 20 in breadth from east to west; contains 1 town and 272 villages. Area, 794 square miles. Population (1881) 101,289, namely, 15,549 Hindus, 1707 Muhammadans, and 84,933 'others.' A small portion of the State only is cultivable; the rest is hilly, rocky, and covered with forest and brushwood. Dharampur is well supplied with rivers: the Damangang\u00e1, the Kolak, the Par, the Aurang\u00e1, and\nthe Ambika flow through the State on their way to the Gulf of Cambay. Except in Dharampur town and a few other villages, where there are reservoirs, wells and river-pools are the only source of the water-supply. The rainfall is estimated at over 70 inches yearly. The climate is very unhealthy. Prevailing diseases are fever, dropsy, diarrhoea, and asthma. The principal products are the flower of the *mahu\u00e1* (Bassia latifolia), teak, blackwood, and bamboos; the crops\u2014rice, pulse, gram, and sugar-cane; the manufactures\u2014mats, baskets, fans, molasses, catechu, and pottery. A cart-road, passing southwards through Peint, connects the State of Dharampur with N\u00e1sik station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, while another rougher track running westwards, and passable for carts except during the rains, joins it with Bals\u00e1r station on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway. There is a regular post, kept up by the Chief, between Bals\u00e1r and Dharampur. The gross revenue is estimated at \u00a325,000.\n\nIn 1882 there were 6 schools, with 275 pupils. The present (1883) Chief is a Hindu of the Sesodi\u00e1 clan of R\u00e1jputs, who claim descent from the Solar race. His name is N\u00e1r\u00e1yandevji Ramdevji, and his title R\u00e1j\u00e1 Mah\u00e1ran\u00e1 Sr\u00ed. He is entitled to a salute of 9 guns, and has power to try his own subjects for capital offences without the express permission of the Political Agent. Persons convicted of murder are punished with life imprisonment. The Chief administers the State himself, and maintains a military force of 207 men, with 4 field guns. The house follows the rule of primogeniture in point of succession, and holds a *sanad* authorizing adoption. It is probable that the territory of Dharampur, or R\u00e1mnagar, as it was originally called, was once much more extensive than now, stretching westward as far as the sea-coast. In 1576, the Chief of R\u00e1mnagar went to meet Akbar's minister Todar Mall at Broach, and accepted military rank at his hands. Seventy-two of the Dharampur villages were wrested away by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s early in the 18th century. The claims of the Peshw\u00e1 on the revenues of the State were ceded to the British under the terms of the treaty of Bassein (1802), and are still levied by officers of the British Government; they yield a yearly sum of from \u00a3600 to \u00a3700. A district constabulary has recently been formed. In all, there are 8 schools in the State.\n\n**Dharampur.**\u2014Chief town of the Native State of Dharampur, Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency; situated in lat. 20\u00b0 34' N., and long. 73\u00b0 14' E.

There is also a dispensary where vaccination is being gradually introduced.\n\n**Dharampuri.**\u2014*Pargan\u00e1* of Dh\u00e1r State, Bh\u00edl (Bheel) Agency, Central India. Population (1881) 18,574; number of houses, 4273,\ndistributed in 138 villages. Agricultural stock\u2014horned cattle, 16,888. Number of wells, 560. Revenue, \u00a36898.\n\n**Dharampuri.**\u2014Town in the Dharampuri pargan\u00e1 of the Dh\u00e1r Native State, Central India; situated on the north bank of the Narbad\u00e1, in latitude 22\u00b0 10' N., and longitude 75\u00b0 26' E., and distant about 36 miles south-west from Dh\u00e1r. During the period of Muhammadan rule at Dh\u00e1r, the town is said to have contained 10,000 houses, and the ruins of the old town extend far beyond its present limits. It now contains about 500 inhabitants, but is gradually extending.\n\n**Dh\u00e1rang\u00e1on.**\u2014Town and municipality in Erandol Sub-division, Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency. Latitude 21\u00b0 N., longitude 75\u00b0 20' 20\" E.; 35 miles east by north of Dh\u00fali\u00e1, and 20 miles west of the railway station of Jalg\u00e1on. Population (1881) 13,081; municipal income (1882\u201383), \u00a3421; municipal expenditure, \u00a3582; rate of taxation per head of municipal population (12,388), 6\u00bdd. Dh\u00e1rang\u00e1on has a post-office, and is the head-quarters of the District superintendent of police and of the Bh\u00edl Corps. The lines for the Corps afford accommodation for 200 families. A considerable trade in cotton and oil-seeds is carried on with Jalg\u00e1on, where many of the Dh\u00e1rang\u00e1on merchants have agents. The paper and cloth of Dh\u00e1rang\u00e1on were formerly held in esteem. At present the manufacture of paper has entirely ceased; but the weaving of coarse cloth still gives employment to more than 100 looms. In the year 1855, Government established a cotton-ginning factory at Dh\u00e1rang\u00e1on, with 93 saw-gins, under the management of a European overseer; merchants and cultivators were charged \u00a31 a month for the use of a gin. But the experiment proved costly, and was subsequently abandoned. Under Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule, Dh\u00e1rang\u00e1on was the scene of a terrible massacre of Bh\u00edls, who had on several occasions plundered the town. A factory was established here by the English in 1674. The following year the town was plundered by Sivaji, and again in 1679 by Sivaji in conjunction with the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ber\u00e1r. It was at that time one of the most flourishing marts in this part of the country. Six years later, in 1685, it was again plundered and burnt by Sambhaji. In 1818, Dh\u00e1rang\u00e1on came into the possession of the British Government; and it was here that Lieutenant, afterwards Sir James, Outram was engaged from 1825 to 1830, in improving the position of the Bh\u00edls, by training them in an irregular corps. The town is badly supplied with drinking water. The most remarkable building is Outram's Bungalow, now used as an office by the Assistant-Collector. Its main hall is 40 feet long, 34 broad, and 16 high. Dh\u00e1rang\u00e1on contains four schools.\n\n**Dh\u00e1rapuram.**\u2014T\u00e1luk in Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 195,232, namely, 94,800 males and 100,432 females:\nnumber of houses, 43,554. Bounded on the north by Erode t\u00e1luk; on the east by Kar\u00far; on the west by Palladam and Udumalpatai; and on the south by the Pal\u00e1ni t\u00e1luk of Mad\u00fara District. Contains 82 villages with their numerous hamlets, and an area of 835 square miles, of which 389,436 acres are occupied at an assessment of \u00a333,801. The t\u00e1luk is chiefly dry land, only 7117 acres being irrigated: 77 per cent. of the soil is entered as red sand. The rivers of the t\u00e1luk are the Amr\u00e1vati, Upp\u00e1r, and Noyel; the first is crossed by 6 anicuts supplying irrigation channels; there are numerous private wells, by which good crops are raised; the uplands are poor and badly tilled. The assessment averages 1s. 6d. per acre for dry, and 16s. for wet land. A large portion of the land is devoted to pasture, cattle being more numerous here than in the surrounding t\u00e1luks. There are no forests or hills. The population is almost solely agricultural. Shops are few; but large weekly markets, especially at Kangay\u00e1m and Dh\u00e1rapuram, supply the needs of the villagers. The chief products are cereals, pulses, tobacco, oil-seeds, cotton, and jaggery. The t\u00e1luk is well supplied with roads, and contains 2 criminal courts, with a deputy tahs\u00edld\u00e1r at Kangay\u00e1m, 2 post-offices, 7 police stations, several schools, including a middle school at Dh\u00e1rapuram, and a dispensary. Number of regular police, 68 men. Arrack and toddy shops number 165. Except Dh\u00e1rapuram town, there are no places of importance in the t\u00e1luk. The Sivanmalai temple and the Nattaroyen Kovil, near Vella Kovil, are much resorted to by the people. Aqua marines were found formerly near Sivanmalai, and rock crystals of good size, form, and lucidity are often found; so also is corundum. The t\u00e1luk is on the whole healthy, being dry and open to the south-west winds from the Palgh\u00e1t gap.\n\nDh\u00e1rapuram (D\u00e1rapur).\u2014Chief town in Dh\u00e1rapuram t\u00e1luk, Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency.

The town lies on the left bank of the river Amr\u00e1vati, in a plateau of open country 909 feet above the sea, which stretches nearly to the Palani mountains, about 15 miles south. A channel from the river bisects the town. Dh\u00e1rapuram is said to have been the capital of the Kshatriy\u00e1 King Bhaja, and is otherwise interesting as having, in 1667, and again in 1746, been taken from Madura by Mysore. In the campaigns with Haidar Al\u00ed and Tip\u00fa S\u00e1hib, it was also a point of some strategical importance, being captured by Colonel Wood in 1768, retaken by Haidar in the same year, again occupied by the British in 1783, given up by the treaty of Mangalore, and finally resumed in 1790 by General Medows. In 1792 the fort was dismantled. For a time Dh\u00e1rapuram was the seat of the District\ncourt, but is now only the head-quarters of the taluk, and as such possesses the usual subordinate administrative establishments, a police station, post-office, school, and dispensary. At the weekly market held here, the gh\u00ed, paddy, and chillies, which, with tobacco, pulses, and oil-seed, form the staple products of the taluk, are collected for export in exchange for metal-ware and cloth. The town is connected by road with three railway stations\u2014Tirupur, Penundurai, and Kar\u00far, the nearest being 30 miles distant.\n\n**Dhari.**\u2014Petty State of Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, Bombay Presidency.

The habitable portion consists of narrow and very rugged valleys, traversed by the K\u00e1l\u00ed river (which rises in this tract), its chief tributary the Dh\u00e1ul\u00ed, and other feeder streams. The inhabitants are Bhotiy\u00e1s, a Tibetan race, who carry on a trade between Hundes and Kum\u00e1un, by means of pack-sheep, over the Dharma Pass. Estimated area, about 400 square miles.\n\n**Dharm\u00e1npur.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in N\u00e1np\u00e1r\u00e1 tahs\u00edl, Bahr\u00e1ich District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Nep\u00e1l, on the east and south by N\u00e1np\u00e1r\u00e1 pargan\u00e1, and on the west by the Kauri\u00e1la river, separating it from Kher\u00ed District. It was formerly included in Dhaurahra, and was only constituted a separate pargan\u00e1 since the British annexation of Oudh. Largely occupied by forest tracts, which comprise 172 square miles out of a total area of 304. The remainder, 132 square miles, is occupied by 64 villages, the cultivated area being only 47 square miles. Population (1881) 25,761, namely, males 14,097, and females 11,664.

Lat. $32^\\circ 15' 42''$ N., long. $76^\\circ 22' 46''$ E. Dharms\u00e1la lies on a spur of the Dhaola Dhar, 16 miles north-east of K\u00e1ngra town, in the midst of wild and picturesque scenery. It occupies the site of an old Hindu sanctuary or dharms\u00e1la (whence the name), and originally formed a subsidiary cantonment for the troops stationed at K\u00e1ngra. In 1855, the District head-quarters were removed to the spot; and a small town rapidly collected around the civil station. It now contains several private European residences, a church, two large barracks for soldiers temporarily invalided from English regiments, three b\u00e1z\u00e1s, public gardens and assembly rooms, courthouse, jail, treasury, hospital, and other public buildings.

Picturesque waterfalls and other objects of interest lie within reach of an easy excursion. A cart-road connects the town with Jalandhar (Jullundur) on the plains; supplies can be obtained at moderate prices; and the station bids fair to become a favourite retreat for civilians and invalids. The rainfall, however, is very heavy; its annual average being returned at 148\u00b73 inches. Trade is confined to the supply of necessaries for European residents and their servants.\n\n**Dharnaoda.**\u2014A petty Chiefship in the G\u00fana (Goona) Sub-Agency,\nunder the Gwalior Agency, Central India.

The present th\u00e1kur, Bh\u00fam Singh, is descended from th\u00e1kur Chatar S\u00e1l, who was given Dharnaoda for his separate maintenance, with the possession of Raghagarh, according to the arrangements made in 1843, under the guarantee by the British Government. The family belongs to the Chauh\u00e1n Rhichi clan of R\u00e1jputs. Thieving and cattle-lifting are incessant in the State.\n\n**Dharupur.**\u2014Village in Part\u00e1bgarh District, Oudh; 24 miles from Bela, and 16 from M\u00e1nikpur. Founded by Dh\u00e1r\u00fa S\u00e1h, the ancestor of the present t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r, whose fort and residence are still in existence. During the Mutiny, British refugees were hospitably received here. At the b\u00e1z\u00e1r adjoining the fort, a considerable trade is carried on, the annual sales reaching \u00a310,000 in value, the market days being Wednesday and Saturday. Population (1881), Hindus, 2002, and Muhammadans, 496; total, 2498. Three Sivaite temples; Government school.\n\n**Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r.**\u2014British District in the Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 country, Bombay Presidency; lying between 14\u00b0 15' and 15\u00b0 51' N. lat., and between 74\u00b0 47' and 76\u00b0 55' E. long. Bounded on the north by the Districts of Belg\u00e1um and Kal\u00e1dgi; on the east by the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) territory of the Nizam, and the river Tungabhadra which separates Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r from the District of Bellary, Madras Presidency; on the south by the State of Mysore; and on the west by the District of North K\u00e1nara. Its greatest length from north to south is 116 miles, and its greatest breadth 77 miles. Area, 4535 square miles. Population (1881) 882,907.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District is roughly divided into two belts, characterized by differences of configuration, soil, and products. The Belg\u00e1um and Harihar road may be considered the dividing line. To the north and north-east of that road, in the Sub-divisions of Nawalgund, Ron, and the greater part of Gadag, spread vast unbroken plains of black soil, which produce abundant crops of cotton. In the south-eastern portion of this plain are the Kapad Hills; and again, after passing over a stretch of black soil in the Karajgi Sub-division, there is an undulating country of red soil, which reaches to the boundary of Mysore. The western belt of the District is traversed by low hills, extending from the southern bank of the river M\u00e1lprabha to near the Mysore frontier. This tract consists of a succession of low ranges covered with herbage and brushwood. The ranges are separated by flat valleys; and it is to these valleys and the lower slopes of the hills that cultivation is chiefly confined. Farther west, the country becomes still more hilly, and the trees increase in size towards the frontier of North K\u00e1nara. In this tract all the Government forest reserves are\nto be found. The Sub-divisions of H\u00e1ngal and Kod, to the south of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r, present almost the same appearance, small hills rising out of the plain in all directions with fertile valleys between. The number of tanks in these Sub-divisions is a special feature in the landscape; but, with some marked exceptions, they are small and shallow, retaining water for not more than three or four months after the rains.\n\nFrom its position on the summit of the watershed of the Peninsula, Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r is devoid of large rivers. Of its seven principal streams, six run eastwards towards the Bay of Bengal, and one penetrates through the Western Gh\u00e1ts to the Arabian Sea. (1) The M\u00e1lprabha, for about 20 miles, forms the northern boundary of the District, dividing it from Kal\u00e1dgi. (2) The Bennihalla has its source about 20 miles south of the town of Hubli, and, flowing northwards through the central plain of the District, falls into the M\u00e1lprabha. Its water is brackish, and soon dries up. (3) The Tungabhadra, on the south-eastern frontier, divides Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r from Mysore and Bellary in Madras. (4) The Warda, a tributary of the Tungabhadra, passes from the south-west to east through two of the southern Sub-divisions of the District. (5) The Dharma crosses Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r in the south, and eventually joins the Warda; and (6) the Kumadwati flows north-east through Kod Sub-division, falling into the Tungabhadra near Holianaweri. (7) The one westward-flowing stream is the Birti N\u00e1l\u00e1 or Gangawali, which passes through the Kalghatgi Sub-division. None of these rivers are navigable, and the only one used for irrigation is the Dharma, in the H\u00e1ngal t\u00e1luk. A dam across it diverts its water, when the river is high, into a channel on the north side, which extends as far as Ad\u00far, a distance of about 6 miles in direct line. This is an old irrigation work constructed under native rule. The channel, besides irrigating a large area, directly feeds a number of small tanks which depend on it for their supply. The waters of the M\u00e1lprabha and Warda are considered the best for drinking, while the water of the Tungabhadra is said by the natives to be heavy and exceptionally sweet. In the west, near the hills, the rainfall is abundant; and as the natural unevenness of the ground offers suitable sites, many tanks have been constructed, and a sufficient supply of water is thus kept in store. But in the central and eastern portion of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r, the water-supply is very scanty, and the flat surface of the country presents few natural advantages for the storage of water on a large scale. Though almost every village has its own tank, the want of drinking water is at times keenly felt, for the shallow tanks rapidly become choked with the drainage from the black cotton-soil. Even in a season of ample rainfall, they dry up by the beginning of March. In 1869, the inhabitants of some of the villages in the plain were forced to fetch their water from distances of 10 or 12 miles, while many migrated with their cattle to the banks of the Tungabhadra and M\u00e1lprabha.\nNor can a sufficient supply be easily obtained from wells. In most parts the water-bearing strata lie far below the surface, occasionally as deep as 80 or 90 feet, while the water obtained is often found to be brackish. Large sums are spent annually on the reservoirs and tanks of the District. The 'black soil,' or regar, occurs in beds from a few inches to 30 or 40 feet in depth, but it is interrupted by chains of hills, and at places covered by alluvial soil and pebbles washed down from their sides. In the north-east of the District some singular hills are met with, rising abruptly out of the plain as isolated landmarks. They are not more than 300 feet high; and the stone varies much in structure, being a loose variegated gritty substance, which sometimes approaches a compact quartz rock, showing grey, whitish yellow, and red bands of all shades of colour. The Kapad Hills are principally composed of hornblende and chloritic schists, gneiss, and mica slate. Manganese is found in considerable quantities. Some of the hills are capped with laterite. The bed of the Doni rivulet, which has its rise in these hills, contains gravel and sand, in which gold dust is found associated with magnetic iron-sand, grains of platinum, grey carbonate of silver, and copper. It is, however, chiefly among the chlorite slate hills on the western side that gold is found. The zone of hills on the west of the District, from 15 to 25 miles broad, consists entirely of various hypogene schists. In its northern part, jaspideous schists predominate; in the centre, these pass into chloritic and argillaceous slates and shales of all shades of white, yellow, red, brown, and green, interstratified with beds of white or iron coloured quartz, and of jaspideous rock. These layers generally form crests and mural ridges on the summits of the hills, which run in parallel ranges north-west by north, and south-east by south.\n\nIn former times, gold is said to have been obtained in abundance, and even now the Kapad range of hills in the neighbourhood of Dambal in the east of the District, and the beds of streams issuing from them, yield some gold. Washing is practised by a class of people called Jalg\u00e4rs, but their employment is not constant, being carried on only for a short time in every year after the flood. At this season their gains are said not to average more than from 9d. to 1s. a day. In the hills in the west of the District, iron was formerly smelted in considerable quantities. Owing, however, to the great destruction of timber during the past forty years, fuel has become scarce, and this industry is now only carried on to a limited extent. The iron made is of superior quality, but cannot as a general rule compete in cheapness with imported iron. The western or hilly portion of the District contains much forest land, which has been set apart by Government for reserves. The black-soil plains, on the other hand, suffer from a scarcity of trees; timber for building purposes has to be brought from\ngreat distances, and sun-dried cakes of cow-dung are the chief fuel. To supply these wants, strict conservation, with replanting, is now being carried on in the Government forest reserves.\n\n*Fere Naturae.*\u2014Of wild animals, the District contains the tiger, leopard, bear, wolf, hy\u00e6na, fox, jackal, wild hog; and of game, the spotted deer and common antelope. Most of the rivers and tanks contain fish, and in the larger reservoirs some of great size are caught.\n\n*History.*\u2014The territory comprised within the present District of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r appears to have formed part of the ancient Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagar, which rose to power in the 14th century. On the overthrow of the Vijayanagar dynasty at the battle of T\u00e1l\u00edkot, in 1564, by a confederacy of Musalm\u00e1n princes, Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r was annexed to the Muhammadan kingdom of Bij\u00e1pur. In 1675, the country was overrun, and partially conquered, by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s under Sivaj\u00ed; and from that time, for about a century, remained subject first to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 ruler of Sat\u00e1ra, and afterwards to the Peshw\u00e1 of Poona. In 1776, under Haidar Al\u00ed, the usurper of Mysore, the Musalm\u00e1ns again occupied Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r; but before five years were over, by the help of a British force, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, in 1791, captured a second time the fort and town of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r. The country remained under Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 management till 1818, when, on the overthrow of the Peshw\u00e1 by the British, it was incorporated with the Bombay Presidency. There are many old forts scattered through the District, and a few religious buildings, elaborately sculptured, and of beautiful though somewhat heavy design. The chief modern buildings are the religious houses or *maths* of the Ling\u00e1yat sect. These are ugly but commodious structures, used as a residence for the priests or *ayahas*, and also to a large extent as resting places for travellers.\n\n*Population.*\u2014In 1872, the population of the District was 989,671. The Census of 1881 returned a total population of 882,907 persons, or 195 to the square mile. There has thus been a falling off of 106,764 persons since 1872. Of the population in 1881, 769,349, or 87 per cent., were Hindus; 100,622, or 11\u00b740 per cent., Musalm\u00e1ns; 2356, or 0\u00b730 per cent., Christians, including 79 Europeans, 73 East Indians, and 2204 native converts; 10,526, or 1\u00b720 per cent., Jains; 31 P\u00e1rs\u00eds; 18 Jews; and 5 Buddhists. The males numbered 442,035, the females 440,872; percentage of males in the total population, 50\u00b707. Classified according to caste, the Hindus included 28,403 Br\u00e1hmans; 3450 R\u00e1jputs; 54,254 Ber\u00e1ds; 2545 Cham\u00e1rs; 6579 Shimpis (tailors); 87,568 Dh\u00e1ngars; 6869 Dhob\u00eds (washermen); 6880 Hajj\u00e1ms (barbers); 39,116 Jangams; 44,345 Kunb\u00eds (cultivators); 4410 Kol\u00eds (cultivators); 18,953 Kosht\u00eds (weavers); 2641 Kumbh\u00e1rs (potters); 4359 Ling\u00e1yats; 1217 Loh\u00e1rs (blacksmiths); 1545 M\u00e1lis (gardeners); 27,612 M\u00e1ngs (inferior caste); 11,392 Mah\u00e1rs (inferior caste); 135,357\nPanchams\u00e1l\u00eds; 21,686 Reddis; 2405 Son\u00e1rs (goldsmiths); 2014 S\u00fat\u00e1rs (carpenters); 22,499 Tel\u00eds (oilmen); and 233,127 'other' Hindus. Among the Muhammadans are included 7994 Path\u00e1ns; 13,118 Sayyids; 78,261 Shaikhs; and 'others,' 1249. Of the adult males in the six classes into which the Census divides the people as regards occupation, there were in all 442,025; namely, in the professional class, 13,750; in the domestic, 4422; in the commercial, 3540; in the agricultural, 207,143; in the industrial, 53,499; and in the indefinite and non-productive, 159,681. Of the 1285 towns and villages in the District in 1881, 303 contained less than two hundred inhabitants, 493 between two and five hundred, 308 between five hundred and one thousand, 114 between one and two thousand, 30 between two and three thousand, 24 between three and five thousand, 9 between five and ten thousand, 1 between ten and fifteen thousand, 1 between fifteen and twenty thousand, and 2 between twenty and fifty thousand.\n\nIn the Sub-divisions of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r, Hubli, Gadag, and Bank\u00e1pur, and in the State of Sawan\u00far, the population contains a considerable Musal-m\u00e1n element. Among the nomadic tribes, the chief are the Waddars, Lamb\u00e1n\u00ed, Goll\u00e1rs, and Advichinchars. The Waddars move, with their wives and families, from place to place in search of work. They are generally employed on earthwork, quarrying, sinking wells, or making roads and reservoirs. The Lamb\u00e1n\u00ed also wander about in gangs. They correspond to the Banj\u00e1ras, or gipsies, of Gujar\u00e1t and Central India, and do a large carrying trade on pack-bullocks and ponies. The Goll\u00e1rs and Advichinchars are a class of wandering jugglers, who live in the forest and pick up a precarious and often dishonest livelihood; but they are not thieves by profession.\n\nThe population of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r is, on the whole, prosperous. The soil is fertile, the climate favourable, and the people not wanting in energy. The cultivators have a good stock of cattle, especially in the eastern parts of the District. Towards the Western Gh\u00e1ts, cultivation is scantier, and the people less thriving.\n\nThere are three Christian Missions in the District. The chief one is subordinate to the Basle German Mission, with resident missionaries at Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r, Hubli, and Gadag-Betigeri, and congregations at the villages of Unkal, Hebs\u00far, and Shagoti. The second mission is subordinate to the Roman Catholic Bishop of Bombay; its chief station is Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r, and it has congregations at Hubli and Tumrikop. The third mission is subordinate to the Archbishop of Goa; excepting the town of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r, its congregational stations are situated beyond the District boundary.\n\nK\u00e1narese is the vernacular language of the District, though the Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r dialect is not so pure as that spoken in K\u00e1nara itself. By many of the better classes Mar\u00e1th\u00ed is understood; and Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed is known to a few.\nThe chief towns of the District are\u2014(1) Hubli, population (1881) 36,677; (2) Dharwar, 27,191 (town 26,520, cantonment 671); (3) Ranibennur, 10,202; (4) Gadag, 17,001; (5) Nargund, 7874; (6) Nawalgund, 7810; (7) Mulgund, 5386; (8) Shahabajar or Bankapur, 6037; (9) Haveri, 5652; (10) Naregal, 6071; (11) Hangal, 5272; (12) Tuminkatti, 4622; (13) Byadgi, 4116; (14) Mundargi, 3826.\n\nFormerly all the principal towns, and even villages, were defended by a fort within which the richest inhabitants lived in well-built houses; without the walls were the huts of the poorer and less influential classes. Though the fortifications have now been allowed to fall into decay, a marked distinction still exists between the town proper or p\u00e9t and the houses within the fort. Villages in the western and southern parts of the District have in general a thriving appearance, arising from the common use of tiled roofs. In the northern and eastern parts, houses are, as a rule, flat-roofed, and there are few trees near the villages. The houses are chiefly constructed on massive woodwork frames, built in with mud bricks, the ends of which are triangular in shape. Formerly many of the villages were surrounded by low walls of mud and sun-dried bricks, as a protection against the attacks of thieves, but most of these walls are now falling into decay.\n\nExclusive of hamlets, there were, in 1881, 14 towns and 1271 inhabited State and alienated villages, giving an average of 0\u00b729 villages to each square mile, and 687 inhabitants to each village. The total number of houses was returned at 206,419, of which 45,269 were unoccupied, showing an average of 45\u00b75 houses per square mile, and of 5\u00b747 persons per house.\n\nThree annual fairs or religious meetings are held in the District\u2014(1) at Hulg\u00far in Bank\u00e1pur Sub-division, in February, in honour of a famous Musalm\u00e1n saint; attendance of pilgrims about 3000; (2) at Yamn\u00far in Nawalg\u00fand Sub-division, in March, also in commemoration of a Muhammadan saint; attendance of pilgrims, about 26,000; (3) at Gudgudd\u00e1pur in R\u00e1nibennur Sub-division, in September, in honour of a Hindu deity, Malh\u00e1r Martand; attendance of pilgrims, about 8700. Trade is carried on only to a very limited extent at these festivals. There are 21 other religious gatherings of less importance.\n\nThe staff of the village community consists of two classes, one connected with the Government, and the other useful to the community alone. The first class comprises the p\u00e1tel, or head-man; the kulkarni, or accountant; shetsandi, or policeman; and talwars, barkis, and mah\u00e1rs, the menial servants. In the second class are the joshi, or astrologer; the k\u00e1zi and mull\u00e1, the Musalm\u00e1n priests; the jangam, or aya; the sut\u00e1r, or carpenter; the loh\u00e1r, or blacksmith; the kumbh\u00e1r, or potter; the son\u00e1r, or goldsmith; the hajj\u00e1m, or barber; the vaidya,\nor doctor; the dhor, or manufacturer of leathern articles for farmers; the dhobi, or washerman; the p\u00faj\u00e1ri, or worshipper; the mathapati, or procurer of milk and butter for strangers; and the mah\u00e1rs, or sweepers. In large villages, the organization may be found complete; but in small villages, the joshi, son\u00e1r, vaidya, dhobi, and hajj\u00e1m, do not generally exist. Besides the above, in some few villages in the H\u00e1ngal, Karajgi, and Kod Sub-divisions, there is a class of village servants called nir manig\u00e1rs, whose special duties are to keep the tank water-courses in repair, and let water on to the fields.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Exclusive of land belonging to other jurisdictions situated within its limits, Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District contains a total area of 2,902,400 acres, of which 864,204 acres, or nearly 30 per cent., have been alienated. Of the remainder, 1,659,321 acres are assessed arable land, and 378,733 acres are unassessed waste. The total cultivated area in 1882\u201383 was 1,503,011 acres, including 1,409,175 acres under dry crops, 86,873 acres under rice, and 6963 acres irrigated for garden crops. The soil of the District may be divided into three classes, viz. red soil, black soil, and a rich brown loam. The red soil is a shallow gravelly deposit formed by the disintegration of hills and rocks. The black soil is the well-known regar, or cotton-soil, on which the value of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r as a cotton-producing District depends. It ordinarily varies in depth from 2 to 20 feet. The brown loam is found chiefly on the west of the District, once the site of large forests; it is supposed to be chiefly of vegetable origin, and is of little depth. The Government land is held under the Bombay Survey tenure, at a revenue fixed, in 1857\u201358, for a term of thirty years. The land alienated by the State is, as a rule, held at a fixed quit-rent. There are two chief crops in the year\u2014the early or kharif, and the late or rabi harvest. The early crops are sown in June, and harvested in October and November. The late crops, except cotton, are sown in October and reaped in February. Cotton is sown in August and picked in March. A field of black soil requires only one ploughing in the year, and is seldom manured. A field of red soil, on the other hand, is ploughed three or four times, and is generally manured. The entire stock of agricultural implements required by a single husbandman may be valued at from 10s. to \u00a32.\n\nThe oxen are of three varieties\u2014two of inferior breed, indigenous to the District, and the large and well-made animals imported from Mysore. These Mysore bullocks are much valued; an ordinary pair fetches about \u00a315, and for a superior pair as much as \u00a345, or even \u00a3200, is sometimes paid. The ponies of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r were once famous, but of late years the breed is said to have fallen off.\n\nThe agricultural stock in possession of the cultivators of Government or kh\u00e1ls\u00e1 villages during 1881\u201382 numbered 89,205 ploughs, 37,376 carts, 224,170 bullocks, 111,352 buffaloes, 122,386 cows, 5162 horses,\n174,528 sheep and goats, and 5633 asses. Of 1,507,942 acres, the total cultivated area in the same year\u2014cereals occupied 756,034 acres, or 50'10 per cent.; pulses, 101,197 acres, or 6'70 per cent.; oil-seeds 70,426 acres, or 4'67 per cent.; fibres, including cotton, 359,210 acres, or 21'19 per cent.; sugar-cane, 3742 acres; tobacco, 1251 acres; and miscellaneous crops, 32,967 acres, or 2'20 per cent.: 184,776 acres were under grass. The current prices of the chief articles of food, per maund of 80 lbs., in the District in 1881-82, were, for wheat, 3s. 7\u00bdd.; for rice, from 6s. 9d. to 9s.; for bijra (Holcus spicatus), 2s. 10\u00bdd.; for joar (Holcus sorghum), 2s. 6d.; for pulses or dal, 5s. 7d.; for wheat flour, 5s. 2d.; for gram, 5s. 1d.; and for salt, 8s. 7\u00bdd.\n\nOf the total just enumerated, 534,185 acres, or 21'06 per cent., were under cotton, the indigenous variety occupying 395,396, and Orleans cotton 138,789 acres. Several attempts had been made by Government to introduce the culture of New Orleans cotton, but up to 1842 without success. In that year, however, the results were most satisfactory. Both in quantity and quality the out-turn was better than the indigenous variety, and the cultivation of New Orleans cotton has since spread rapidly. Its superiority is now generally recognised, not only in Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r, but in the neighbouring Districts. As American cotton cannot be properly ginned by the native process, it was found necessary to introduce new machinery. To ensure a sufficient supply of the best gins, they are imported from England and offered for sale at the Government factory at Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r, while for their repair branch factories have been established at local centres of trade.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014From the earliest date of which historical record is available, the District appears to have suffered from droughts of more or less severity. Between 1787 and 1796 a succession of droughts, accompanied by swarms of locusts, occurred. This period of famine is said to have been at its height about 1791-92. The people were forced to feed on leaves and berries, and women and children were sold or deserted. No measures were taken by the Government of the day to relieve the sufferers. The next famine was in 1802-1803, occasioned by the immigration of people from the valley of the God\u00e1vari and the march of the Peshwa\u2019s army through the country. In 1832, from want of rain, prices ruled very high, but the distress cannot be said to have amounted to famine. Owing to successive bad seasons, famines occurred in the years 1866 and 1877, and it was found necessary to employ large bodies of people on works of public utility.\n\nTrade, etc.\u2014In no part of the Bombay Presidency has more been done of late years to improve communications than in Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r. Thirty years ago, there were neither roads nor carts. In 1881-82, the\nnumber of carts was returned at 37,376, and about 1000 miles of road were kept in sufficient repair to allow a spring carriage to be driven over them. The District is connected with the ports of Coompta, K\u00e1rw\u00e1r, and Vingorla by excellent roads, the distance from the western sea being about 100 miles. On the east, a road runs to the railway station of Bellary, in the Madras Presidency. The distance of Bellary from the Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r frontier is also about 100 miles. A line of railway is now under construction to pass through the District, from Bellary via Gadag and Hubli, to Marmag\u00e1o in Portuguese territory, with a branch to Belg\u00e1um, while the Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Railway, from Shol\u00e1pur, passes through the north-eastern portion of the District via B\u00edjapur to Gadag.\n\nNo returns of the internal trade of the District are available. Cotton is the chief article of export, and European goods, chillies, cocoa-nuts, molasses, and betel-nuts are imported from K\u00e1nara and Mysore. The local trade in jo\u00e1r is also considerable.\n\nThe manufactures consist of cotton and silk cloth, and the usual household utensils and ornaments. Common silk and cotton cloth are woven to a considerable extent in all the large towns. Fabrics of delicate texture and tasteful design are occasionally produced. Fine cotton carpets are manufactured at Nawalg\u00fand, both for home consumption and for export to the neighbouring Districts. The wild aloe grows well, and the manufacture of matting from its fibre has been carried on at the jail with success. In the city of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r there is also a considerable manufacture of glass bangles. Blocks of blue and green glass in a rough state are imported from Bellary and re-melted in crucibles, made of a species of clay brought from Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, in Belg\u00e1um. During eight months of the year (October to June) iron-smelting is carried on in small furnaces in parts of the District, but want of fuel prevents any extension of this industry.\n\nThe majority of the traders are local capitalists, a few representing firms in Bombay and other important places. Except a few P\u00e1rsis in the town of Dh\u00e1rwar, they are by caste generally Br\u00e1hmans or Ling\u00e1yats, a few being Muhammadans, G\u00fajars, etc. Porters and other unskilled labourers earn from 4\u00bdd. to 6d. a day; agricultural labourers from 3d. to 4\u00bdd., bricklayers and carpenters from 1s. 3d. to 1s. 4\u00bdd. Female labourers earn about one-third less than males. Lads of from twelve to fifteen get about two-thirds less than full-grown men.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District is divided into 11 Sub-divisions, or t\u00e1lukas, and into 3 petas or larger fiscal units. The 11 Sub-divisions of the District are\u2014Dh\u00e1rwar, Hubli, Gadag, Nawalgund, Bankapur, Ron, Ranibennur, Kod, Hangal, Karajgi, and Kalghatgi. The administration in revenue matters is entrusted to a Collector and 5 Assistants, of whom 3 are covenanted civil servants. For the settlement of civil disputes there were, in 1881, 4 courts,\nincluding the court of the District Judge. Thirty officers, including 6 Europeans, shared the administration of criminal justice. In the same year, the total strength of the District or regular police force was 733 officers and men. The total cost of maintaining this force was \u00a312,154. These figures show one policeman to every 6\u00b718 square miles as compared with the area, and 1 to every 1204 persons as compared with the population; the cost of maintenance was \u00a32, 13s. 7d. per square mile, or 3d. per head of the population. There is 1 jail at Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r town, in which 562 male and 109 female prisoners were confined in 1880. The District contains 51 post-offices and 3 telegraph offices, viz. at Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r, Hubli, and Gadag-Betigeri.\n\nIn 1881\u201382, the re-settlement of the Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District was completed at a total cost of \u00a344,030, resulting in a total increase of the land revenue to \u00a3266,540, the annual increase consequent on re-settlement being \u00a345,489. The local funds, created since 1863 for works of public utility and rural education, yielded, in 1881\u201382, a sum of \u00a315,891. There are 11 municipalities in the District; their total receipts in 1881\u201382 amounted to \u00a310,170, and their expenditure to \u00a310,641. The incidence of municipal taxation varied from 10\u00bdd. to 3s. 1\u00bdd. per head. In the same year there were 377 schools in the District, or an average of 5 schools for every 15 villages, with an attendance of 27,113 pupils. In Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r town there is 1 library, and 3 local newspapers are published.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate is, for both natives and Europeans, about the healthiest in the Bombay Presidency. In December and January, dews are heavy and general. From February to the middle of April is the hot season; and from the latter date to the beginning of June, when the regular rainy reason sets in, showers are frequent. Except in November and December, when strong winds blow from the east, the prevailing winds are from the west, south-west, and south-east. The average maximum temperature for the hot months (March to May) is 93\u00b0 F.; the maximum for the rainy season (June to October), 83\u00b0; the maximum for the cold season (November to February), 84\u00b0 F. The average rainfall at Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r town for a period of seven years ending 1881 was 32\u00b789 inches. At Hubli the rainfall for the same period averaged 25\u00b78 inches.\n\nThere are 3 dispensaries in the District, and a civil hospital at Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r town. During 1881\u201382, 43,498 persons in all were treated, of whom 42,900 were out-door and 598 in-door patients. There is also a lunatic asylum at Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r. The births registered in the District in 1881 numbered 33,315, or 37\u00b773 per 1000 of population; the deaths in the same year numbered 20,492, or 23\u00b730 per 1000; the average death-rate for the five years previous being 41\u00b70. Number of persons vaccinated in 1881\u201382, 21,025.

Area, 425 square miles; contains 1 town and 127 villages. Population (1881) 111,137, namely, 55,524 males and 55,613 females. Hindus number 92,547; Muhammadans, 15,011; 'others,' 3579. The Sub-division contained in 1883, 1 civil and 10 criminal courts; police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 3; regular police, 70 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 382.\n\n**Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r.**\u2014The chief town of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District, situated in latitude 15\u00b0 27' N., and longitude 75\u00b0 3' 20\" E. Area, including the suburbs, 3 square miles. Population (1881) 27,191, including 671 in cantonments, thus classified\u201419,709 Hindus, 6545 Muhammadans, 271 Jains, 618 Christians, 24 P\u00e1rs\u00eds, and 24 'others.' The fort stands on undulating ground. Towards the west, low hills run down to the plains, forming the last spurs of the Western Gh\u00e1ts. The fort and the town are almost hidden from view on the east by trees and rising ground. The approach from the south is striking. The highest point is occupied by the Collector's office, from which a commanding view of the town, suburbs, and surrounding country is obtained. Below the office and adjacent to it is the temple of Ulvi-Basapa, and beyond, the hill of M\u00e1ilargud, formerly considered the key to the fort of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r. The travellers' bungalow or rest-house is one mile west of the fort, and the cemetery is a little to the south-west. The church, about one mile to the south of the travellers' bungalow, belongs to the Basle German Mission. The cantonments lie to the north-west of the fort, about 2 miles distant. Beyond the town extensive plains of black soil stretch across to the hills of Nawalgund and Nargund on the east, and on the north-east to the famous hills of Yellama (a Hindu deity) and Parsagad. Towards the south-east, the hill of Mulg\u00fand appears at the distance of about 36 miles. There is no authentic evidence of the date when the fort was founded. A pur\u00e1na or legendary chronicle concerning the origin of the neighbouring temple of Someswar makes no mention of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r. According to local tradition, the fort was founded in 1403 by one Dh\u00e1r R\u00e1o, an officer in the Forest Department, under Ram R\u00e1j\u00e1, the Hindu King of Anig\u00fandi. The Anig\u00fandi kingdom was overthrown by Muhammad Adil Sh\u00e1h of Bij\u00e1pur in 1568. In 1685, the fort was captured by the Mughal Emperor of Delhi; and in 1753, it fell into the hands of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. In 1778, Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r was taken from the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s by Haidar \u00c1li, the Muhammadan usurper of Mysore; and in 1791, it was retaken by a British force auxiliary to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s under Parshur\u00e1m Bh\u00e1o. On the final over-\nthrow of the Peshw\u00e1, in 1818, Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r, with the other possessions of that potentate, fell to the disposal of the British Government. The fort is described as being well planned and naturally strong. Previous to 1857 it was kept in repair. Since then it has been breached; and, like all other forts in the District, it is now fast falling into ruins. In 1837, Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r was the scene of violent feuds between the Br\u00e1hmans and Ling\u00e1yats, compelling the interference of the British Government.\n\nThe town, which is very straggling, is made up of 7 quarters, or mah\u00e1ls. There are few good houses with upper storeys. A market is held every Tuesday. The only monument of historical interest is that erected in memory of the Collector, Mr. St. John Thackeray, and the sub-Collector, Mr. J. C. Munro, who were killed at the taking of Kitt\u00far in 1824. About a mile and a half south of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r is a hill called the Mailargad; on its summit stands a small square stone temple, built after the Jain fashion, and facing the east. The columns and beams are of massive stone, and the roof of the same material is handsomely carved. On one of the columns is an inscription in Persian, recording that the temple was converted into a mosque in 1680 by the deputy of the King of Bij\u00e1pur. The only prosperous classes of the population are the Br\u00e1hmans and Ling\u00e1yats. The influential Br\u00e1hmans are generally public officers, vak\u00edls (advocates), zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs (landowners), and sauk\u00e1rs (bankers and money-lenders). The Ling\u00e1yats are, as a rule, traders, who almost monopolize the export of cotton, timber, and grain. Some of the Musalm\u00e1ns are also wealthy merchants. A few P\u00e1rs\u00eds and M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris, who have recently settled in the town, deal chiefly in European goods. The principal articles of export are cotton and rice; the imports comprise English piece-goods, chillies, cocoa-nut, molasses, dates, betel-nut, groceries, indigo, lead, zinc, and wrought and unwrought copper and brass. There are no manufacturing industries of any importance; but in the jail, carpets, table-linen, cloths, and cane articles,\u2014all of superior quality,\u2014are made by the prisoners. In 1882\u201383, the municipal income amounted to \u00a32509, and the expenditure to \u00a32297; the incidence of municipal taxation being 1s. 5d. per head. The water-supply is drawn from two reservoirs. There are also several wells in the town, but with one or two exceptions they are not used for drinking purposes, the water being brackish. The native quarter was formerly unhealthy; but since the introduction of the Municipal Act, some attention has been paid to drainage and sanitary requirements.\n\nDhas\u00e1n.\u2014River of Central India, rising in Bhop\u00e1l State, in latitude 23\u00b0 30' N., and longitude 78\u00b0 32' E., a few miles north of S\u00edrmau, at an elevation of 2000 feet. After a course of 10 or 12 miles, it enters S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) District, Central Provinces; through which it flows for 60 miles,\nand then runs along the southern boundary of Lalitpur District, North-Western Provinces; finally, after a course of 220 miles, falling into the Betwa. On the road between S\u00e1gar (Saugor) and R\u00e1hatgarh, the Dhas\u00e1n is crossed by a stone bridge.\n\n**Dhaul\u00e1giri** *(Dew\u00e1l\u00e1giri).*\u2014Mountain in the State of Nep\u00e1l. Latitude 29\u00b0 11' N., longitude 82\u00b0 59' E. One of the loftiest peaks of the Him\u00e1layas; height, 26,826 feet above sea-level.\n\n**Dhauleshvaram.**\u2014Town in God\u00e1vari District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Dowlaishvaram.\n\n**Dhaurahra.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of Nigh\u00e1san tahs\u00edl, Kheri District, Oudh; bounded on the north by the Kauri\u00e1la, on the east by the Dah\u00e1war, and on the south by the Chauka rivers; the western boundary is Nigh\u00e1san pargan\u00e1. In early times, prior to the Muhammadan conquest of Kanauj, Dhaurahra was the freehold property of Alha and Udal, the famous generals of Mahoba. It then formed a part of Garh Kil\u00e1 Naw\u00e1, which was settled and visited by Firoz Sh\u00e1h, and was probably owned by P\u00e1s\u00eds, whose R\u00e1j\u00e1 lived at Dhaurahra. The Bisens held this tract during the decline of the Mughal power; but they were displaced by the Chauh\u00e1n J\u00e1ngres, who now own it. First constituted a pargan\u00e1 by Naw\u00e1b Safd\u00e1r Jang. It consists of alluvial deposits from the Kauri\u00e1la and Chauka rivers, and is annually inundated. The inhabitants suffer much from fever, and cultivation is very backward. Soil principally loam and clay, rather sandy towards the Chauka. Area, 261 square miles, of which 145 are cultivated and 72 cultivable. The 117 villages which the pargan\u00e1 comprises are held in talukdd\u00e1ri tenure by 18 proprietors. Population (1881) 82,567, namely, Hindus, 74,510, and Muhammadans, 8057. Land revenue, \u00a38239. The roads consist merely of rough bridle-paths, crossing the rivers by ferries. Communication principally by the Kauri\u00e1la, Dah\u00e1war, and Chauka rivers; by means of which, during ten months of the year, a brisk trade is carried on in grain and oil-seeds.\n\n**Dhaurahra.**\u2014Town in Kheri District, Oudh; 3 miles west of the Chauka river, 80 miles north of Lucknow, and 73 miles east of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. Lat. 28\u00b0 N., long. 81\u00b0 9' E. Population (1881) 5767, namely, Hindus, 4023; and Muhammadans, 1744. Area of town site, 163 acres. Constituted a municipality under the provisions of Act xv. of 1873. Town police force consisting of 1 sub-inspector, 3 head-constables, and 12 constables. During the Mutiny of 1857, the fugitives from Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur and Muhamdi, escaping towards Lucknow, sought the protection of the Dhaurahra R\u00e1j\u00e1; but he, on pressure from the rebel leaders, gave them up to their enemies. For this he was afterwards tried and hanged, and his estates confiscated.\n\n**Dhaurahra.**\u2014Town in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, Oudh; 4 miles from the Gogra river, and 20 miles from Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d town on the road to\nLucknow. Population (1881) 3168, namely, 3108 Hindus and 60 Muhammadans. It contains neither temple, mosque, nor school; but a handsome gateway, said to have been built by a king of Oudh, Asaf-ud-daul\u00e1, stands just outside the town. On the opposite side of Dhaurahra is an ancient Hindu shrine, shaded by a magnificent grove of tamarind trees. A Hindu legend relates that Mah\u00e1deo once lived here, his body being buried in the earth. A party of religious mendicants on their way to Ajodhya conceived the idea of digging out the deity and exhibiting him for gain. As they dug, however, his head sank into the earth, and the party fled in horror. To commemorate the miracle, a dome, surrounded by a masonry platform and a wall, was constructed over the spot by two devout merchants. The place is now almost in ruins.\n\n**Dhaura-Kunjara.** \u2014 Petty chiefship under the Indore Agency, Central India. A remuneration of \u00a38 is granted to the th\u00e1kur or chief for protection of the roads between Simrol Gh\u00e1t and Sigw\u00e1r.\n\n**Dhenk\u00e1n\u00e1l.** \u2014 Tributary State of Orissa, Bengal. Lat. 20\u00b0 31' to 21\u00b0 11' 30\" N., and long. 85\u00b0 3' to 86\u00b0 5' E.; area, 1463 square miles; population (1881) 208,316. Bounded on the north by P\u00e1l Lah\u00e1ra and Keunjhar, on the east by Cuttack District and Athgarh, on the south by Tigari\u00e1 and Hindol, and on the west by T\u00e1lcher and P\u00e1l Lah\u00e1ra, the Br\u00e1hman\u00ed forming the boundary for a considerable distance. This river runs from west to east, through a richly-cultivated valley, affording a waterway for trade. Cultivable waste land abounds. Iron is plentifully found, but is only worked on a small scale. A petty trade in cochineal is also carried on. Chief village, also the residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, Dhenk\u00e1n\u00e1l, situated in lat. 20\u00b0 39' 45\" N., long. 85\u00b0 38' 16\" E. Weekly markets, for the sale of country produce, are held at Hodipur and Sad\u00e1ipur villages. Population (1881) 208,316, namely, Hindus, 128,358; Muhammadans, 535; Christians, 2; Buddhists, 48; aboriginal tribes (the most numerous being the Savars), 79,347; and \u2018others,\u2019 26. Estimated annual revenue, \u00a37900; tribute payable to Government, \u00a3509; militia, 44 men; regular police, 41; rural police, 742. Dhenk\u00e1n\u00e1l is the best organized and most prosperous of the Orissa Tributary States. The late chief received the title of Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 in 1869, in recognition of his moderation and justice towards his people, and of his liberality in the Orissa famine of 1866. The present chief being a minor, the State is now (1883) under the direct management of Government.\n\n**Dheri Shah\u00e1n** (or Sh\u00e1h Dheri).\u2014Village in R\u00e1wal Pindi tahsil, R\u00e1wal Pindi District, Punjab. Lat. 33\u00b0 17' N., and long. 72\u00b0 49' 15\" E. Identified by General Cunningham with the ancient city of Taxila. The existing remains extend over an area of 6 square miles, and rank as the most interesting and extensive, and the best preserved memorials\nof antiquity in the whole Punjab Province. The number and size of the stupas and monasteries render them worthy of the greatest attention. The earliest inhabitants of the surrounding region appear to have been the Takkas, who originally held all the Sind S\u00e1gar Do\u00e1b; and from their name General Cunningham derives that of Taxila or Takshasila, which Arrian describes as 'a large and wealthy city, the most populous between the Indus and the Hydaspes' (or Jehlam). The city stood a few miles to the north of the Margala Pass, where several mounds still mark the sites of its principal buildings. Alexander rested his army at this point for three days, and was royally entertained by the reigning sovereign. The Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, Fa Hian, visited Taxila, as a place of peculiar sanctity, about 400 A.D. Again, in 630 and 643, his countryman and co-religionist, Hwen Thsang, also made it a halting-place while on his pilgrimage, but found the seat of government removed to Kashmir. The ruins of Taxila consist of six separate portions. The mound of B\u00edr, close to the modern rock-seated village of Dheri Shah\u00e1n, abound in fragments of brick and pottery, and offers a rich mine of coins and gems for the antiquary. Hati\u00e1l, a fortified spur of the Margala range, probably formed the ancient citadel; it is enclosed by a ruined wall, and crowned by a large bastion or tower. S\u00edr-Kap presents the appearance of a supplementary fortress, united with the citadel by a wall of circumvallation. Kacha-Kot possibly gave shelter to the elephants and cattle during a siege. B\u00e1bar-Kh\u00e1na contains the remains of a stupa, which General Cunningham identifies with that of Asoka, mentioned by Hwen Thsang. Besides all these massive works, a wide expanse, covered by monasteries or other religious buildings, stretches on every side from the central city to a considerable distance.\n\n**Dhi-Dharamrai.** \u2014 Petty chiefship under the Bhil (Bheel) or Bhop\u00e1war Agency of Central India. The population is entirely Bhil.\n\n**Dhob\u00e1** *(Dhob\u00e1-Dhobini).* \u2014 Mountain peak in the Prat\u00e1pgiri or Chinna Kimedi estate, Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency. Latitude 20\u00b0 N., longitude 84\u00b0 23\u2032 E. It forms part of the Eastern Gh\u00e1t range, 8 miles distant from Dimrigiri. Height, 4166 feet above the sea. A station of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India.\n\n**Dhob\u00e1-kh\u00e1l.** \u2014 Village in the G\u00e1ro Hills District, Assam; on the Someswar\u00ed river, near which a fine outcrop of the coal strata was discovered in 1873 by the officers of the Survey. Lat. 25\u00b0 28\u2032 N., long. 90\u00b0 46\u2032 E.\n\n**Dhodar Al\u00ed.** \u2014 One of the most important of the raised roads or embankments constructed in Assam by forced labour during the rule of the Aham dynasty. It runs parallel to the Brahmaputra through the entire length of Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r District, for a distance of 117\u00bd miles, and is under the management of the District Road Committee. It joins\nthe Assam Trunk Road at the Dhaneswari river in the Gol\u00e1gh\u00e1t Sub-\ndivision.\n\n**Dhola.**\u2014Petty State in Gohelw\u00e1r *pranth* or division, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r,\nGujarat, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 1 village, with 1 indepen-\ndent tribute-payer. Estimated revenue, \u00a3150, of which \u00a332, 10s. is\npayable as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda and \u00a35, 18s. to Jun\u00e1garh.\n\n**Dholarwa.**\u2014Petty State in South K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Gujarat, Bombay\nPresidency; consisting of 1 village, with 1 independent tribute-payer.\nEstimated revenue, \u00a3200 per annum, of which \u00a310, 6s. is payable as\ntribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda and \u00a32, 6s. to Jun\u00e1garh.\n\n**Dholb\u00e1j\u00e1.**\u2014Large village in Purniah District, Bengal. Lat. 26\u00b0 16'\nN., long. 87\u00b0 19' 21\" E. Situated on the Matiy\u00e1ri road, 40 miles\ndistant from Purniah town, and 16 miles from Basantpur Primary\nschool.\n\n**Dholera.**\u2014Seaport in the Dhandh\u00faka Sub-division, Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d\nDistrict, Bombay Presidency; 62 miles south-west of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. One\nof the chief cotton-marts in the Gulf of Cambay. Latitude 22\u00b0 14'\n45\" N., and longitude 72\u00b0 15' 25\" E. Population (1881) 10,301, namely,\n7266 Hindus, 1289 Muhammadans, 1740 Jains, 4 Christians, and 2\nP\u00e1rs\u00eds. Situated in the swampy tract extending along the west of the\nGulf of Cambay, within the limits of the Peninsula of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r.\nThough called a port, the town of Dholera lies about 12 miles from\nthe sea. The Bh\u00e1dar or Dholera creek on which it stands is said\nto have been, a century ago, open for boats up to Dholera; but for\nthe last fifty years the creek has silted up and trade passes through two\nports\u2014Khun, about 5 miles lower down on the same creek, and B\u00e1vli\u00e1ri,\non an inlet of the sea about 16 miles south. The space between the\ntown and the port was traversed by a tramway constructed by a\ncompany of native speculators at a cost of \u00a35000, but it has ceased\nto run. There is a lighthouse at the entrance to the creek. Post-office,\ntelegraph office, 3 Government schools, police station, and dispensary.\nDholera has given the trade name to a quality of cotton well known in\nthe European market: during the American War (1862\u201365) it was the\nchief cotton port in Gujarat.\n\n**Dholka.**\u2014Sub-division of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bombay Presidency.\nBounded on the north by S\u00e1nand; on the east by Kaira District and\nCambay; on the south by Dhandh\u00faka; and on the west by K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r.\nArea, 665 square miles; contains 1 town and 117 villages. Population\n(1881) 111,192, namely, 56,485 males and 54,707 females. Hindus num-\nber 98,080; Muhammadans, 11,284; \u2018others,\u2019 1828. The Sub-division\nis a plain sloping south-west to the little Rann. In the east along the\nS\u00e1barmati the fields are hedged and the land is thickly planted with\nfruit-trees. The south-west is a bleak country exposed to the biting\nwinds of the cold season. The only river is the S\u00e1barmati. In 1877\nthere were 2534 wells, 132 water lifts, and 725 ponds. Average rainfall, 30 inches. In the year of the Bombay thirty years' settlement (1856-57), there were 9763 holdings with an average acreage of 12 acres, paying an average rental of \u00a31, os. 9d. Agricultural stock in 1877 \u2014 horned cattle, 47,839; horses, 1068; sheep and goats, 12,181; camels, 79; ploughs, 10,532; carts, 4358. In 1878, the total area of cultivated land was 222,141 acres, of which 27 per cent. were fallow or under grass. Cereals occupied 136,891 acres out of the 162,714 under actual cultivation; wheat occupied 91,638 acres; jowar, 29,889; cotton, 14,638. In 1884, the Sub-division contained 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; police stations, 3; regular police, 102 men; village watchmen (chaukidars), 334. Land revenue (1883), \u00a329,986.\n\n**Dholka.** \u2014 Chief town of the Dholka Sub-division, Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bombay Presidency; 22 miles south-west of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. Latitude 22\u00b0 43' 30\" N., longitude 72\u00b0 28' 30\" E. Population (1881) 17,716, namely, 11,880 Hindus, 5658 Muhammadans, 126 Jains, and 9 Pars\u00eds. Municipal revenue (1881-82), \u00a3992; rate of taxation, 1s. 1\u00bdd. per head. Dholka is situated amidst ruined palaces, mosques, mausoleums, and spacious tanks, embanked and lined with masonry. Though not regularly fortified, it is surrounded by a wall of mud 4 miles in circumference. Probably one of the oldest towns in Gujar\u00e1t. Dholka lies on the river S\u00e1barmati, on the chief land-route between Gujar\u00e1t proper and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. It is supposed, in the early Hindu period, to have been the resting-place of the Pandy\u00e1s, of Prince Kanaksen of the Solar race, of Minal Devi, the mother of Sidhi Raj of Anhilw\u00e1da (1094-1143), and of Vir Dhaval, the founder of the V\u00e1ghela dynasty (13th century). During the Muhammadan period, Dholka was the residence of a local governor from Delhi, and it still contains the remains of many fine Musalm\u00e1n buildings. It was taken by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in 1736; came into the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r's hands in 1757; and was eventually ceded to the British in 1804. The greater part of the inhabitants are Kasb\u00e1tis ('townsmen'), the descendants of the soldiers of fortune who came with the V\u00e1ghelas when driven from Anhilw\u00e1da by the Khilji Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn in 1297. The chief industry is the weaving of women's robes, s\u00e1ris, the best of their kind in Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District. There are 5 schools, sub-judge's court, post-office, and dispensary.\n\n**Dholpur.** \u2014 Native State in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, Central India, under the political superintendence of the Dholpur Agency. Lies between 26\u00b0 22' and 26\u00b0 57' N. latitude, and between 77\u00b0 16' and 78\u00b0 19' E. longitude; area, 1200 square miles. It extends from north-east to south-west for a length of 72 miles, with an average breadth of 16 miles. Dholpur is bounded on the north by the British District of Agra, from which it is for the most part divided by the B\u00e1nganga river;\non the south by the river Chambal, which separates it from the State of Gwalior; on the west by the States of Karauli (Kerowlee) and Bhartpur (Bhurtpore). Chief town, Dholpur.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The Chambal flows from south-west to north-east for over 100 miles through Dholpur territory. During the dry weather it is a sluggish stream 300 yards wide, and lies 170 feet below the level of the surrounding country. In the rains it rises generally about 70 feet above its summer level; its breadth is then increased by more than 1000 yards, and it runs at the rate of $5\\frac{1}{2}$ miles an hour. It is bordered everywhere by a labyrinth of ravines, some of which are 90 feet deep, and extend to a distance of from 2 to 4 miles from the river's bank. The Chambal is unnavigable on account of its rapid changes of level. Boats ply at 16 gh\u00e1ts or crossings between the Dholpur and Gwalior banks. The most important crossing is at R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t, 3 miles south of the town of Dholpur, on the high road between Agra and Bombay. A bridge of boats is kept up between the 1st November and the 15th June, and a large ferry-boat plies during the rest of the year. No tributaries fall into the Chambal during its course through Dholpur territory. The B\u00e1ngang\u00e1 or Utangan river, rising in the hills near Bairat in Jaipur, runs for about 40 miles between the northern boundary of Dholpur and the District of Agra; its bed is about 40 feet below the surrounding country, and in the rains it is liable to floods, with a rise of from 17 to 20 feet. The other rivers are the Parbati, which rises in Karauli, and, traversing Dholpur in a north-easterly direction, falls into the B\u00e1ngang\u00e1; and its two tributaries, the Merka and Merki. These three streams dry up in the hot season, leaving only occasional pools where the channels are deep. The general nature of the soil being a friable alluvium overlying a stratum of stiff yellow clay, the beds of all the rivers in Dholpur are considerably below the general level of the country, and all their banks are more or less cut up and fringed with ravines.\n\nA ridge of red sandstone, varying in breadth from 2 to 14 miles, with an elevation of from 560 to 1074 feet above sea-level, runs for over 60 miles through the State in the direction of its greatest length. It affords a valuable stone for building purposes, fine grained and easily worked in the quarries; it hardens by exposure to the weather, and does not deteriorate by lamination. The railway bridge over the Chambal is built entirely of this stone. Kankar, or nodular limestone, is found in many places in the ravines leading to the rivers; and a bed of excellent limestone occurs on the banks of the Chambal, near the Agra and Bombay road, within $2\\frac{1}{2}$ miles of the town of Dholpur. No coal or metallic ores are found in the State. The soil is everywhere poor on the sandstone ridge, and in its immediate vicinity; but it becomes richer and more fertile in proportion to the increase of\ndistance from the ridge. In the north and north-west, the soil is for the most part a mixture of sand and clay, known as *domat*, which is as productive as the best land in Agra District. To the north-east, in the R\u00e1j\u00e1khera *pargan\u00e1*, an area of about 90 square miles is covered with black soil, similar to that of Bundelkhand, yielding excellent cold weather crops. Dholpur is a grain-producing country, and is not remarkable for any special manufactures. The chief crops raised are *b\u00edjra* (Holcus spicatus), *moth*, and *jo\u00e1r* (Holcus sorghum); and in the cold season a considerable quantity of wheat and barley. Cotton and rice are also produced. Irrigation is carried on by means of tanks and wells, the average depth at which water is found being 25 feet. Of the total area of the State (768,000 acres), about 50 per cent. is under cultivation. About 43'3 per cent. of the country is barren, and about 3 per cent. is occupied by villages, rivers, tanks, etc.\n\nThe land tenures are in most respects similar to those of the North-Western Provinces, with this important exception, that in Dholpur, as under other Native Governments, the chief is the absolute owner of the land. The *zamind\u00e1rs*, or *lambard\u00e1rs* as they are more usually termed, are persons (generally descendants of the original founders of the village) who contract with the State for the payment of the revenue demand, which they collect from the cultivators. So long as they observe their contract, they are considered as owners of the land actually cultivated by them and by their tenants, and also of uncultivated land sufficient for the grazing of the village cattle. The remainder of the untilled land, with its produce, groves, tanks, etc., belongs to the State.\n\n**Population.**\u2014A rough Census of the population taken during the survey of the State in 1876, showed a total of 227,976 inhabitants. The regular general Census of 1881, five years later, disclosed a population of 249,657 persons, dwelling in 4 towns and 534 villages, and occupying 48,429 houses; average density of inhabitants per square mile, 208'04; number of towns and villages per square mile, 45; number of houses per square mile, 40'35; number of persons per house, 5'15. Total males, 138,342; females, 111,315. Classified according to religion, there were returned 229,050 Hindus, 18,097 Muhammadans, 27 Christians, and 2483 Jains. Among the Muhammadans were included 9680 Shaikhs, 970 Sayyids, 229 Mughals, 5585 Path\u00e1ns, and 1633 'others.' The most numerous classes are at two extremes of the Hindu social scale\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 44,347, and Cham\u00e1rs, 35,075. R\u00e1jputs number 23,766; G\u00fajars, 19,482; Kachh\u00eds, 2510; Min\u00e1s, 11,924; J\u00e1ts, 3932; Baniy\u00e1s, 13,664; Ahirs, 768; and other Hindu castes, 76,065. The Muhammadans live for the most part in the towns of B\u00e1ri and Dholpur. The G\u00fajars, the oldest known inhabitants of the country, are generally found along the banks of the Chambal, in the D\u00e1ng or\nravine t\u0101luks of B\u0101r\u012b and Gird; they are great cattle-lifters. The Min\u0101s, believed to have come originally from Jaipur (Jeypore), are among the best cultivators of the State. The people generally are engaged in tilling the land, and the whole country is agricultural. The dominant religion is Hinduism of the Vishnuvite sect. Four towns have a population of over 5000, namely, Dholpur (15,833), Puran\u012b Chaoni (5246), B\u0101r\u012b (11,547), and R\u0101j\u0101khera (6247). In 1882, 8 schools, with a total daily attendance of 447 pupils, were maintained in the larger towns of the State. In one of these, English, Persian, and Hind\u012b are taught; in three, Persian and Hind\u012b; and in four, Hind\u012b alone.\n\nThe Trunk Road from Agra to Bombay runs through the State from north to south, passing by Dholpur town. There are no other metalled roads but a few fair-weather tracks\u2014one leading from Dholpur by R\u0101j\u0101khera to Agra; a second with a main direction west from Dholpur to B\u0101r\u012b, and thence to Bhartpur on one side and Karaul\u012b on the other; a third having a main direction to the north-east from Dholpur to Kol\u0101r\u012b and Baseri, and thence to Karaul\u012b.\n\nThe Sindhia State Railway, between Agra and Gwalior, runs through the State in a direction generally parallel to the Grand Trunk Road. It crosses the Chambal by a bridge of 12 spans of 200 feet each, about 112 feet above the river bed.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The land revenue of Dholpur in 1882\u201383 amounted to \u00a371,400. Customs and other sources of revenue brought up the gross total to \u00a3110,572. The expenditure in the same year was \u00a391,001. The land, which had not been surveyed since 1570, in the reign of Akbar, was re-surveyed in 1875\u201376, preparatory to a re-settlement which was conducted on a basis similar to that of the North-Western Provinces, but simpler in its details. For fiscal purposes the State is divided into the following five sub-divisions or tahsils\u2014namely, Gird Dholpur, of 5 t\u0101luks; B\u0101r\u012b, of 7 t\u0101luks; Baseri, of 2 t\u0101luks; Kol\u0101r\u012b, of 3 t\u0101luks; and R\u0101j\u0101khera, of 2 t\u0101luks. Fifty-seven villages in the State belong to j\u0101gird\u0101rs, who in return are expected themselves to serve in the State army, and to furnish a certain number of horsemen for the State service; 44 villages have been set apart principally as religious grants; and the State exercises the right of interference in cases of oppression or exaction on the part of the j\u0101gird\u0101rs. The Mah\u0101r\u0101j R\u0101n\u0101 is assisted by a council of regency consisting of three members. The Dholpur jail is managed on a system similar to that in British jails. It contains an average of 130 prisoners. The police and judicial administration is under the N\u0101zim, or chief civil and criminal judge, who tries all cases; but those involving a punishment heavier than three years\u2019 imprisonment must be referred for confirmation to the Council of Management. In\n1882-83, 1978 criminal cases were disposed of; and 348 civil suits were heard. There are 11 police stations and 44 outposts, with a watchman in each village. A small forest department is employed in each pargan\u00e1 under the tahsild\u00e1r. The arrangements for the collection of customs are co-ordinate with those for land revenue.\n\nThe climate is generally healthy. The hot winds blow steadily and strongly during the months of April, May, and June. The annual rainfall averages from 27 to 30 inches. There are three State dispensaries, at which 20,561 cases were treated in 1882; 7895 persons were vaccinated during the same period.\n\nHistory.\u2014According to local tradition, Dholpur derives its name from R\u00e1j\u00e1 Dholan Deo Tonw\u00e1r (of the ancient Tomar or Tonw\u00e1r dynasty of Delhi), who about 1004 A.D. held the country between the Chambal and B\u00e1nganga rivers. Previous to that time it is supposed to have formed part of the kingdom of Kanauj. Very little is authentically known of the country until the Musalm\u00e1n conquests, with which it became early incorporated. Dholpur for a time resisted B\u00e1bar, but under Akbar the State formed part of the Muhammadan Subah, or province, of Agra. In 1658, the sons of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1n, Aurangzeb and Mur\u00e1d, fought for empire at Ranka Chabutra, three miles east of Dholpur, Aurangzeb proving victorious. After the death of Aurangzeb, Dholpur was again the scene of a struggle for empire. Within its territory the sons of Aurangzeb, Azam and Muazzam, decided their pretensions in the field, and the former prince was slain; but R\u00e1j\u00e1 Kali\u00e1n Singh Bhadauriy\u00e1, taking advantage of the troubles which beset the new emperor on every side, obtained possession of the Dholpur territory. The Bhadauriy\u00e1s remained undisturbed till 1761, when the J\u00e1t R\u00e1j\u00e1, S\u00faraj Mall of Bhartpur (Bhurtpore), after the battle of P\u00e1nipat, seized upon Agra and overran the country. During the succeeding forty-five years, Dholpur changed masters no less than five times. In 1775, it shared the fate of the rest of the Bhartpur possessions, which were seized by Mirz\u00e1 Najaf Kh\u00e1n. On the death of Mirza in 1782, it fell into the hands of Sindhia. At the outbreak of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 war in 1803, it was occupied by the British, by whom, in accordance with the treaty of Sarji Anjeng\u00e1on, it was, at the end of the year, ceded to the Gwalior chief. In 1805, under fresh arrangements with Daulat R\u00e1o Sindhia, it was resumed by the English, who in 1806, finally uniting the territories of Dholpur, B\u00e1ri, and R\u00e1j\u00e1khera with Sir Muttra into one State, made it over to Mah\u00e1r\u00e1n\u00e1 Kirat Singh (the ancestor of the present chief of Dholpur) in exchange for his territory of Gohad, which was given up to Sindhia. The reigning family of Dholpur are J\u00e1ts of the Bamr\u00e1olia family, belonging to the Desw\u00e1li tribe, which claims a very ancient lineage. The ancestor of the family is said to have been in possession of lands at Bamr\u00e1oli near\nAgra in 1195, from which circumstance they have taken their name. They joined the side of the R\u00e1jputs against the Musalm\u00e1ns, and received a grant of the territory of Gohad, whence the title of R\u00e1n\u00e1 was assumed. This is said to have occurred in 1505 A.D. They appear to have become connected with B\u00e1ji R\u00e1o Peshw\u00e1; and in 1761, when the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s had been completely defeated at P\u00e1nipat, R\u00e1n\u00e1 Bh\u00edm Singh seized the fort of Gwalior. In 1777, Sindhia besieged and took the fortress. In order to form a barrier against the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Warren Hastings in 1779 made a treaty with the R\u00e1n\u00e1, and the joint forces of the English and the R\u00e1n\u00e1 retook Gwalior. In 1781, a treaty with Sindhia stipulated for the integrity of the Gohad territories; but after the treaty of Salbye, the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1n\u00e1 was abandoned, on the ground that he had been guilty of treachery, and Sindhia re-possessed himself of Gohad and Gwalior. The R\u00e1n\u00e1 went into exile, until Lord Wellesley\u2019s policy against the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s again brought him forward, when the territories of Dholpur were made over to Kirat Singh in 1804. But in 1805, Lord Cornwallis re-transferred Gohad and Gwalior to Sindhia, leaving to the R\u00e1n\u00e1 the lands which he still possesses. Kirat Singh\u2019s successor, Bhagwant Singh, showed a loyal attachment to the British Government, especially during the Mutiny of 1857, for which he received the insignia of K.C.S.I. He died in 1873, and was succeeded by his grandson, the present chief, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1n\u00e1 Nih\u00e1l Singh, born in 1863, whose mother is a sister of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Pati\u00e1la. The R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Dholpur is entitled to a salute of 15 guns. The military force of the State consists of 600 cavalry, 3650 infantry, 32 field guns, and 100 gunners.\n\n**Dholpur.**\u2014The capital of the Native State of Dholpur, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, Central India, situated in lat. 26\u00b0 42\u2032 N., and long. 77\u00b0 56\u2032 E., on the Grand Trunk Road between Agra and Bombay, about 34 miles south of Agra and 37 miles north-west of Gwalior. In 1881 it contained a population of 15,833, namely, 10,587 Hindus, 5215 Muhammadans, and 31 \u2018others.\u2019 Three miles south of Dholpur, the Chambal river is crossed at R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t by a bridge of boats between the 1st November and the 15th June, and by ferry during the rest of the year. The Sindhia State Railway between Agra and Gwalior passes through Dholpur, and the railway bridge across the Chambal is within a distance of 5 miles. The original town is supposed to have been built by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Dholan Deo in the beginning of the 11th century, to the south of the present site. The Emperor B\u00e1bar mentions Dholpur, and states that it surrendered to him in 1526. His son, Prince Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, is said to have moved the site farther to the north, in order to avoid the encroachments of the Chambal river. An enclosed, and to some extent fortified, sar\u00e1i was built in the reign of Akbar. The new portion of the town and the palace of the R\u00e1n\u00e1 were built by R\u00e1n\u00e1 Kirat Singh, the great-grandfather of the present chief. A fair is held\nhere for fifteen days in the latter part of October, when a large traffic in merchandise, cattle, and horses is carried on. Goods are brought from Delhi, Agra, Cawnpur, and Lucknow. Religious fairs for the purpose of bathing are held at Machkund, a lake 3 miles to the west of Dholpur, in May, and again at the beginning of September. The lake, which covers an area of 41 acres, lies in a natural hollow of great depth; it is filled in the rains by the drainage of the surrounding country, and maintained by the convergence of springs having their sources in the sandstone hills by which it is surrounded. The lake has no less than 114 temples on its banks, none of an earlier date than the 15th century. Another large fair is held at Salpau, 14 miles north-west of Dholpur, at the end of February.\n\n**Dhol Samudra.**\u2014Marsh in Faridpur District, Bengal; situated to the south-east of Faridpur town. During the rains it expands into a lake of about 8 miles in circumference, the water extending close to the houses of the town. In the cold weather it gradually dwindles, and in the hot season is only a mile or two in circumference.\n\n**Dhoneg\u00e1on.**\u2014Town in Buld\u00e1na District, Ber\u00e1r. Population (1881) 4259.\n\n**Dhor\u00e1ji.**\u2014Fortified town in the peninsula of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency. Latitude 21\u00b0 45' N., longitude 70\u00b0 37' E.; 43 miles south-west of R\u00e1jkot, and 52 miles east of Porbandar. Population (1881) 16,121, namely, 6991 Hindus, 8210 Muhammadans, and 920 Jains.\n\n**Dhotria-Baisola.**\u2014Petty chiefship of Dh\u00e1r Native State, under the Bhil or Bhop\u00e1war Agency, Central India. Under a settlement made in 1818 the th\u00e1kur or chief engaged to pay annually \u00a3250 to the State of Dh\u00e1r. Population entirely Bhil. The chief holds 9 villages.\n\n**Dhr\u00e1fa.**\u2014Petty State of the Hal\u00e1l pr\u00e1nt or division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency. It consists of 24 villages, with 9 independent tribute-payers. The revenue is estimated at \u00a36000; tribute is paid of \u00a3370, 12s. to the British Government, and of \u00a3116, 10s. to the State of Jun\u00e1garh.\n\n**Dhr\u00e1ngadr\u00e1.**\u2014Native State under the Political Agency of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Province of Gujar\u00e1t (Guz\u00e9r\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency. It lies between 22\u00b0 30' and 23\u00b0 N. latitude, and between 71\u00b0 and 71\u00b0 49' E. longitude, and contains an area of 1142 square miles, with 129 villages. Population (1881) 99,686, namely, 88,665 Hindus, 5686 Muhammadans, and 5335 'others.' An uneven tract intersected by small streams, and consisting of hilly and rocky ground, where stone is quarried. With the exception of a small extent of rich black loam, the soil is of inferior quality. The climate is hot, but healthy. The principal crops are cotton and the common varieties of grain. The manufactures are salt, copper and brass vessels, stone\nhandmills, cloth, and pottery. There are no made roads, but the country tracks permit the passage of pack-bullocks. **Dholera**, about 70 miles to the south-east of Dhr\u00e1ngadr\u00e1 town, in Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District, is the nearest port. There are 31 schools, with 1400 pupils. The chief of Dhr\u00e1ngadr\u00e1 entered into engagements with the British Government in 1807. Among the small chieftains of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, he holds the position of a ruler of a first-class State, and is entitled to a salute of 11 guns. The chief bears the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1 S\u00e1hib. He is a Hindu, a R\u00e1jput by caste, and of the Jh\u00e1l\u00e1 stock. He pays to the British Government and the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh an annual tribute of \u00a34467, 14s., and maintains a military force of 2150 men. He holds no sanad authorizing adoption, and the succession follows the rule of primogeniture. He has power of life and death over his own subjects. The Jh\u00e1l\u00e1 family is of great antiquity, and is said to have entered K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r from the north, and to have established itself first at P\u00e1tri, in the Viramg\u00e1m Sub-division of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District, whence it moved to Halwad, and finally to its present seat. The greater part of this territory would seem to have been annexed at one time by the Muhammadan rulers of Guzer\u00e1t. Subsequently, during the reign of the Emperor Aurangzeb (1658\u20131707), the Sub-division of Halwad, then called Muhammadnagar, was restored to the Jh\u00e1l\u00e1 family. The petty States of Limri, Wadhwan, Ch\u00fara, S\u00e1yla, and Th\u00e1n-Lakht\u00e1r in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r are offshoots from Dhr\u00e1ngadr\u00e1; and the house of W\u00e1nk\u00e1ner claims to be descended from an elder branch of the same race. Transit dues are not levied in the State. The gross revenue in 1882 was \u00a340,000.\n\n**Dhr\u00e1ngadr\u00e1.**\u2014Chief town of the Native State of Dhr\u00e1ngadr\u00e1, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 22\u00b0 59' 10\" N., long. 71\u00b0 31' E.; 75 miles west of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. Population (1881) 12,304, namely, 8914 Hindus, 1473 Muhammadans, 1913 Jains, and 4 Christians. The town is fortified.\n\n**Dhrol.**\u2014Native State under the Political Agency of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Province of Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency; situated between 22\u00b0 14' and 22\u00b0 42' N. lat., and between 70\u00b0 24' and 70\u00b0 45' E. long. It lies inland, and contains 1 town and 64 villages. Area, 400 square miles. Population (1881) 21,777, namely, 18,501 Hindus, 2644 Muhammadans, and 631 'others.' The country is for the most part undulating and rocky. The soil is generally light, and irrigated by water drawn from wells and rivers by means of leather bags. The climate, though hot in the months of April, May, and October, is generally healthy. The crops are sugar-cane and the ordinary varieties of grain. Coarse cotton cloth is manufactured to a small extent. There are no made roads, but the country tracks permit the passage of carts. The produce is chiefly exported from Jodiya, a town on the coast. The gross revenue is estimated at \u00a311,700. There are 4 schools, with 270 pupils. Dhrol\nranks as a second-class State among the States in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. The ruler entered into engagements with the British Government in 1807. The chief is a R\u00e1jput by caste, of the J\u00e1rej\u00e1 branch, with the title of Th\u00e1kur S\u00e1hib. He holds no sanad authorizing adoption, and the succession follows the rule of primogeniture. He pays a tribute of \u00a31023, 2s. to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda and the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh, and maintains a military force of 118 men. He has power of life and death over his own subjects. No transit duties are levied in the State.\n\n**Dhrol.**\u2014Chief town of the Native State of Dhrol, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency; situated in latitude 12\u00b0 34' N., and longitude 70\u00b0 30' E. Population (1881) 4613, being 3109 Hindus, 1133 Muhammadans, and 371 Jains.\n\n**Dhubr\u00ed.**\u2014Sub-division of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, comprising the two police circles of Dhubr\u00ed and Sukchar. Total population (1881) 282,010, namely, Hindus, 191,163; Muhammadans, 89,357; and 'others,' 1490. Number of villages, 662; number of houses, 50,617.\n\n**Dhubr\u00ed.**\u2014Chief town of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Assam, the head-quarters having been removed from Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 town in 1879; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 2' N., and long. 90\u00b0 2' E., on the right bank of the Brahmaputra, at the point where that river leaves the valley of Assam, and turns south to enter the plains of Bengal. Population (1881) 2893. Dhubr\u00ed is also the head-quarters of the Superintendent of Telegraphs, Assam Division; and as the terminus of the emigration road running through Northern Bengal, and a stopping-place for Assam steamers, the town is rapidly rising in importance. Dhubr\u00ed is now (1882) the terminus of a service conducted by the Northern Bengal State Railway; and steamers ply daily in connection with that railway, between Dhubr\u00ed and Kur\u00edgr\u00e1m on the Dharla river in the rainy season, and with Jatrapur on the Brahmaputra in the cold weather. A steam ferry crosses the Brahmaputra to Fak\u00edrganj town.\n\n**Dhude.**\u2014Petty State in the Bombay Presidency.\u2014See DANG STATES.\n\n**Dhul\u00e1pra.**\u2014Jhil, or natural reservoir in Sah\u00e1ranpur District, North-Western Provinces, 7 miles west of Sah\u00e1ranpur town. In connection with the drainage arrangements of the Eastern Jumna Canal, a cut has been made from this jhil for purposes of reclamation; but up to the end of 1882, only 500 bigh\u00e1s had been reclaimed.\n\n**Dhul\u00e1tia.**\u2014A guaranteed Th\u00e1kurate or petty chiefship of the Western M\u00e1lwa Agency, Central India. Receives \u00a340 per annum from Sindhia, and \u00a360 from Holkar as tankha on Mal\u00eddpur and Dep\u00e1lpur.\n\n**Dh\u00falia.**\u2014Sub-division of Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 759 square miles. Population (1881) 78,137; average density, 103 persons per square mile. Since the Census of 1872, the population\nhas increased by 9814. Number of villages, 152, of which 2 are alienated. Bounded on the north by Virdel; on the east by Pachora and Amalner; on the south by Sub-divisions of N\u00e1sik District; and on the west by Pimpalner. Four square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The remainder, according to the revenue survey, contains 345,250 acres, or 72 per cent., of arable land. Of these, in 1878, 178,109 acres, or 53 per cent., were under tillage. In 1862-63, the year of the Bombay settlement for the Sub-division, it embraced 6747 holdings, with an average area of 24 acres, paying an average rent of \u00a32, 3s. 4d. In 1878, cereals occupied 61 per cent. of the land under tillage; pulses, 6\u00b75 per cent.; oil-seeds, 8\u00b77 per cent.; cotton, 22 per cent. The Sub-division is broken by low hills, is watered by the P\u00e1njhra and Bori rivers, and is on the whole fairly wooded and well cultivated. It is traversed from north to south by the road from Agra to Bombay, which divides it into two nearly equal portions, and passes through the town of Dh\u00fali\u00e1. The climate is fairly healthy, except just after the rains. The average rainfall of the last 12 years was 23\u00b716 inches. The water-supply, especially in the south, is scanty. The prevailing soil is red, but there are some patches of excellent black loam. The petty district of Songir is included in Dh\u00fali\u00e1 Sub-division. Land revenue of the Sub-division (1883), \u00a318,651.\n\nDh\u00fali\u00e1.\u2014Chief town of Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency, and head-quarters of the Dh\u00fali\u00e1 Sub-division; situated in latitude 20\u00b0 54' N., and longitude 74\u00b0 46' 30\" E., on the southern bank of the P\u00e1njhra river, and 30 miles north of Ch\u00e1l\u00edsg\u00e1on, the nearest railway station. Area, including suburbs, about 2 square miles; houses, 3000. Population (1881) 18,449, namely, 14,018 Hindus, 2973 Muhammadans, 445 Jains, 245 Christians, 26 P\u00e1rs\u00eds, and 742 'others.' Municipal revenue (1882-83), \u00a32998; municipal expenditure, \u00a32535; rate of taxation, 2s. 7\u00bdd. per head. The town is divided into New and Old Dh\u00fali\u00e1. In the latter, the houses are irregularly built, the majority being of a very humble description. In the former there are regular streets of well-built houses, with a fine stone bridge crossing the P\u00e1njhra. In 1872, Dh\u00fali\u00e1 was visited by a severe flood, which did much damage to houses and property.\n\nUntil the beginning of the present century, Dh\u00fali\u00e1 was an insignificant village, subordinate to L\u00e1ling, the capital of the L\u00e1ling or Fateh\u00e1b\u00e1d Sub-division. Under the rule of the Niz\u00e1m, L\u00e1ling was incorporated with the District of Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d. The fort of L\u00e1ling occupies the summit of a high hill, about 6 miles from Dh\u00fali\u00e1, overhanging the Agra road and the Avir Pass leading to M\u00e1leg\u00e1on. This stronghold, like all ancient buildings in Kh\u00e1ndesh, is locally ascribed to the Gauli R\u00e1j\u00e1, but it was more probably built by the Farrukhi kings, whose\nfrontier fortress it subsequently became. To the same Arab princes may be attributed the numerous stone embankments for irrigation found throughout the country, of which those on the P\u00e1njhra river above and below Dh\u00fali\u00e1 are good examples. The old fort at Dh\u00fali\u00e1 is also assigned to this dynasty, but it was probably, like the village walls, restored and improved by the Mughal governors. The town appears to have passed successively through the hands of the Arab kings, the Mughals, and the Niz\u00e1m, and to have fallen into the power of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s about 1795. In 1803 it was completely deserted by its inhabitants on account of the ravages of Holkar and the terrible famine of that year. In the following year, B\u00e1l\u00e1j\u00ed Balwant, a dependant of the Vinchurkar, to whom the pargan\u00e1s of L\u00e1l\u00edng and Song\u00edr had been granted by the Peshw\u00e1, re-peopled the town, and received from the Vinchurkar, in return for his services, a grant of in\u00e1m land and other privileges. He was subsequently entrusted with the entire management of the territory of Song\u00edr and L\u00e1l\u00edng, and fixed his head-quarters at Dh\u00fali\u00e1, where he continued to exercise authority till the occupation of the country by the British in 1818. Dh\u00fali\u00e1 was immediately chosen as the head-quarters of the newly-formed District of Kh\u00e1ndesh by Captain Briggs. In January 1819 he obtained sanction for building public offices for the transaction of revenue and judicial business. Artificers were brought from distant places, and the buildings were erected at a total cost of \u00a32700. Every encouragement was offered to traders and others to settle in the new town. Building sites were granted rent free in perpetuity, and advances were made both to the old inhabitants and strangers to enable them to erect substantial houses. At this time, Captain Briggs described Dh\u00fali\u00e1 as a small town, surrounded by garden cultivation, and shut in between an irrigation channel and the river. In 1819 the population numbered only 2509 persons, living in 401 houses. In 1863 there were 10,000 inhabitants; while by 1872 the number had increased to 12,489, and by 1882 to 18,449. From the date of its occupation by the British, the progress of Dh\u00fali\u00e1 appears to have been steady; but it is only since the recent development of the trade in cotton and linseed that the town has become of any great importance as a trading centre. Coarse cotton and woollen cloth and turbans are manufactured for local use, and a steam cotton-press was opened in 1876 by Volkart Brothers of Bombay. Since 1872, a little colony of Musalm\u00e1ns from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, Benares, and Lucknow have settled at Dh\u00fali\u00e1, who say that they left their own homes on account of poverty. They are Momins by caste, and declare themselves orthodox Muhammadans, but their co-religionists in Dh\u00fali\u00e1 take them to be Wah\u00e1b\u00eds. They support themselves by weaving s\u00e1ris of fine texture, which they sell\nat a lower rate than the local merchants. Dh\u00fali\u00e1 is a cantonment town, and possesses 2 hospitals, telegraph and post offices. Since 1873, on the withdrawal of the detachment of regular Native infantry, the Bh\u00edl Corps have occupied the lines lying to the south-west of the town, where also are the jail, the court-house and offices, and the dwellings of European officers. In the lines situated near the hamlet called Mogl\u00e1\u00ed outside Dh\u00fali\u00e1 proper, is stationed a detachment of Poona Horse. Briggs' Suburb is the newest and most prosperous part of the city. Weekly fair on Thursdays, at which commodities to the estimated value of \u00a35000 change hands. There were in 1879, 5 Government schools, with 551 pupils. In 1883, 465 in-door and 3393 out-door patients were treated in the dispensary.\n\n**Dhuli\u00e1n.**\u2014Village in Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal; situated on the Ganges. Site of an annual fair, and one of the most important river marts in the District. Large trade in rice, pulses, gram, wheat, and other food-grains.\n\n**Dhulipnagar.**\u2014Town and cantonment in Bannu District, Punjab. \u2014See EDWARDESABAD.\n\n**Dh\u00fam\u00e1.**\u2014Village in Seon\u00ed District, Central Provinces; situated 13 miles north of Lakhn\u00e1don and 34 miles from Jabalpur on the northern road, at an elevation of 1800 feet above sea-level. Encamping ground, school, police station, and travellers' bungalow. Population about 1000.\n\n**Dhurw\u00e1i.**\u2014One of the Hasht-bhai j\u00e1girs or petty States in Bundelkhand, under the Central India Agency. The founder of the family was R\u00e1i Singh, a descendant of B\u00edr Singh Deo, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Orchh\u00e1, who held the territory of B\u00e1rag\u00e1on. He divided it amongst his eight sons, whence their j\u00e1girs were called the Hasht-bhai (or eight brothers). There now remain four, of which Dhurw\u00e1i is one. The present holder, Diw\u00e1n Ranj\u00far Singh, is a Hindu Bundela. Area of State, 18 square miles; population (1881) 1598; revenue, \u00a31200.\n\n**Dh\u00fasan.**\u2014River of Bengal.\u2014See PARWAN.\n\n**Diamond Harbour.**\u2014Sub-division of the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal; situated between 21\u00b0 31\u2032 and 22\u00b0 21\u2032 30\u2033 N. lat., and between 88\u00b0 4\u2032 and 88\u00b0 33\u2032 30\u2033 E. long. Area, 417 square miles; villages, 1569; occupied houses, 44,402. Total population (1881) 344,330, namely, males 171,732, and females 172,598. Proportion of males in total population, 49\u00b79 per cent. Hindus numbered 253,041; Muhammadans, 88,536; Christians, 2602; Sant\u00e1ls, 34; other aboriginal tribes, 117. Number of persons per square mile, 826; villages per square mile, 3\u00b776; persons per village, 219; houses per square mile, 118; inmates per house, 7\u00b74. The Sub-division comprises the five police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) of Diamond Harbour, Deb\u00edpur,\nB\u00e1nkipur, Kalp\u00ed, and Mathur\u00e1pur. It contains 3 civil and 3 criminal courts, with a regular police force of 106 officers and men, and 921 village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs). The cyclone of October 1864, with its accompanying storm-wave, caused a fearful destruction of life and property here. The greater number of deaths occurred on S\u00e1gari Island, within Diamond Harbour Sub-division, and in the Sundarbans. Out of a population of 5625, only 1488 persons escaped. It was estimated that in all the villages within one mile of the river the loss of life was 80 per cent., with a loss of cattle in the same proportion. The famine of 1866 also caused great distress. The extension of the Diamond Harbour line of railway from Son\u00e1pur on the Calcutta and South-Eastern State Railway, recently opened, will speedily develop the resources of this tract.\n\nDiamond Harbour.\u2014Port and head-quarters of Diamond Harbour Sub-division, Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s District, Bengal; situated on the left bank of the H\u00fagl\u00ed river, in lat. 22\u00b0 11' 10\" N., long. 88\u00b0 13' 37\" E. Well known as the anchorage of the Company\u2019s ships in old times now a telegraph station. A harbourmaster and customs establishment are maintained here to board vessels proceeding up the river; and the movements of all shipping up or down are telegraphed from Diamond Harbour, and published several times a day in the Calcutta Telegraph Gazette. But no town or even village has sprung up; and since the introduction of steam, few vessels have to wait here for the tide. The chief relic of its historical importance is its graveyard. A great scheme for dock-building at Diamond Harbour, as an auxiliary port for Calcutta, has been recently brought forward; but no final decision has yet (1883) been arrived at. Diamond Harbour has now been brought within 38 miles of Calcutta by rail, by the construction of a railway from Son\u00e1pur station, on the Calcutta and South-Eastern State Railway. Distant from Calcutta 30 miles by a good road, 41 by river.\n\nDiamond Harbour Canal.\u2014In Diamond Harbour Sub-division, Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal; extending from Th\u00e1kurpukur to Khol\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed, a distance of 23 miles, although a portion of it for three miles in length has silted up.\n\nDiamond Island.\u2014A low wooded island, about 1 mile square in area, and visible at 5 leagues, lying off the mouth of the Bassein river, in Pegu, British Burma. Lat. 15\u00b0 51' 30\" N., and long. 94\u00b0 18' 45\" E. It is 50 miles distant from Pagoda Point, and about 8 miles from Negrais Island or Haing-gyi. In shape it is quadrilateral, its angles facing the points of the compass. During strong southerly gales, landing is difficult. This island appears to have been never occupied by the Burmese, to whom it is known as Meimma-hla-kyun; but it is visited by those engaged in collecting the eggs of turtles, which are very abundant. Important as the home station of the Alguada Reef\nlighthouse establishment; and connected with Bassein by telegraph, principally for the use of masters of ships calling for orders.\n\n**Dib\u00e1i.**\u2014Thriving market town in Bulandshahr District, North-Western Provinces; lat. $28^\\circ 12' 30''$ N., long. $78^\\circ 18' 35''$ E. Distant from Bulandshahr 26 miles south-east, and from Al\u00edgarh 26 miles north. It lies between the two head branches of the Chhoiya N\u00e1la, whose ravines form an efficient natural drainage-channel; and is said to have been built about the time of Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1\u00fad Gh\u00e1zi, 1029 A.D., upon the ruins of Dhundgarh, a captured R\u00e1jput city. Population (1881) 8216, namely, Hindus, 5107; Muhammadans, 3077; Jains, 14; 'others,' 18. Area of town site, 90 acres. Trade has greatly increased since the opening of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, which has a station called Dib\u00e1i at the village of Kaser, 3 miles distant by metalled road. The weekly market held on Monday is now the largest in the District; a spacious masonry terrace has been built for the convenience of traders, and adjoining it a fine tank is now (1883) far advanced towards completion. The town contains four sar\u00e1\u00eds or native inns, two schools, a post-office, and a police station. The b\u00e1z\u00e1r is being greatly enlarged. The fortunes of this town have varied inversely with those of An\u00fapshahr, the present head-quarters (as Dib\u00e1i was formerly) of the tahsil, which is now declining. A small revenue for police and conservancy purposes is raised in Dib\u00e1i under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856, but the town will doubtless soon be constituted a regular municipality.\n\n**Dibru** (or **Son\u00e1pur**).\u2014A river in the southern half of Lakhimpur District, Assam, which flows from east to west, nearly parallel to the Brahmaputra, for about 100 miles, and finally empties itself into that river just below the town of Dibrugarh, to which it has given its name.\n\n**Dibrugarh.**\u2014The head-quarters Sub-division of Lakhimpur District, Assam, comprising the two divisions formerly known as Matak and Sadiy\u00e1, consisting of the whole of the District lying south of the Brahmaputra, and the eastern portion of the area to the north of it. Area, 2038 square miles. Population in 1881, 126,143, namely, Hindus, 109,053; Muhammadans, 4029; and 'others,' 13,061. Number of villages, 697; number of houses, 19,718. The Sub-division contains the police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) of Dibrugarh; Dum-duma, Jaipur, and Sadiy\u00e1.\n\n**Dibrugarh** ('Fort on the Dibru river').\u2014Chief town and head-quarters of Lakhimpur District, Assam; situated in lat. $27^\\circ 28' 30''$ N., and long. $94^\\circ 57' 30''$ E., on the Dibru river, about 4 miles above its confluence with the Brahmaputra. Population (1881) 7153, including the troops in the military cantonment. Hindus numbered 5222; Muhammadans, 1881; and Christians, 50. Dibrugarh is the terminus of the river trade, as commercial steamers never run higher; they\ntown, on the banks of the S\u00e1i. Population (1881) 2751, namely, Hindus, 2536; Muhammadans, 215. Good b\u00e1z\u00e1r.\n\n**Dihang** (or **Dihong**).\u2014River in Lakhimpur District, Assam, one of the three which contribute to make up the Brahmaputra. It brings down the largest volume of water, and is generally regarded as the continuation of the Tsanpu or great river of Tibet, and thus the real parent of the Brahmaputra. It is supposed to pierce the barrier range of the Himalayas through a narrow gorge in the Abar Hills.\n\n**Dihing.**\u2014The name of two rivers in Lakhimpur District, Assam, which contribute to make up the waters of the Brahmaputra\u2014(1) the No\u00e1 Dihing, rising in the Singpho Hills in the extreme eastern frontier of British territory, flows in a westerly direction into the main stream of the Brahmaputra just above Sadiy\u00e1; (2) the Bur\u00ed Dihing rises in the P\u00e1tkai Hills in the south-east corner of Lakhimpur District, and also flows in a westerly direction, past Jaipur town, and finally forms the boundary between Lakhimpur and Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r Districts before reaching the Brahmaputra. It is navigable up to Jaipur by steamers during the rainy season. The two rivers are connected by an artificial channel, passing near the village of Bisag\u00e1on. The valley of the Bur\u00ed Dihing contains an extensive coal-field, with outcrops at Jaipur and M\u00e1kum. The total marketable out-turn is estimated at about 20 million tons, of excellent quality, and there are tolerable facilities for water-carriage. Petroleum also exists in abundance in the same tract. In 1866, both the coal and the petroleum were worked under a Government grant by a European capitalist, but on his death the enterprise was discontinued. In the years 1874\u20131876, the mineral resources of this tract were examined by an officer of the Geological Survey, and favourably reported on. A company called the Assam Railway and Trading Company, formed for the purpose chiefly of exploiting the M\u00e1kum coal, has recently constructed a railway on the metre gauge from the Dibrugarh steamer gh\u00e1t to Dam-Dama, a distance of 45 miles, and thence on to M\u00e1kum coal-fields, crossing the Dihing river above the M\u00e1kum fort. The first rails were laid in 1881, and the line was opened throughout in 1883.\n\n**Diji** (*Kot Diji*, also called *Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d*).\u2014Fort in the Khairpur State, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Latitude 27\u00b0 20' 45\" N., longitude 68\u00b0 45' E. Of no importance as a place of strength. A jail has recently been built below the fort.\n\n**Dikth\u00e1n.**\u2014Town in Sindhia's territory, and the capital of a *pargan\u00e1* of Gwalior, under the Bhil or Bhop\u00e1war Agency of Central India; situated 16 miles west of Mhau (Mhow) and 14 miles due east of Dh\u00e1r. The *pargan\u00e1* is held in j\u00e1\u015b\u00edr by Hunwant R\u00e1o Madik and R\u00e1m R\u00e1o Madik, and the revenue is \u00a34000 per annum. The *pargan\u00e1* is managed by two *kumaisd\u00e1rs*, or agents for the j\u00e1\u015b\u00edrd\u00e1rs, who always\nreside at Gw\u00e1lior. Appeals from the kumaisd\u00e1r's decisions are referred to the Naib Subah of Amjhera.\n\n**Dil\u00e1war.**\u2014Fort in Bah\u00e1walpur State, Punjab. Lat. 28\u00b0 44' N., long. 71\u00b0 14' E. Situated in a desert, 40 miles from the left bank of the river Panjnad. Very difficult of access. The old fort is said to have been originally built by R\u00e1i Dhera Sidh Bhalt in 843 A.D. It remained in the possession of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Jaisalmer (Jeysulmere) until 1748, when it was seized by the D\u00e1\u00fadputras shortly after their settlement in Bah\u00e1walpur.\n\n**Dilw\u00e1ra.**\u2014Town in Udaipur (Oodeypore) Native State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Situated among the eastern ranges of the Aravallis, 14 miles north-east of Udaipur. Dilw\u00e1ra is the chief town of the estate of a first-class noble of Udaipur, who owns 149 villages. The palace of the chief is on a hill to the south, overlooking the town. About 2\u00bd miles farther to the south is the hill-temple of Dilw\u00e1ra, on a remarkable conical peak about 1000 feet above the town; the ascent is by a zig-zag road cut out of the rock on its western and south-western faces. This hill forms a landmark for miles around.\n\n**Dim\u00e1pur.**\u2014Village in the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills District, Assam; on the Dhaneswari (Dhansiri) river, 12 miles north of Sam\u00e1guting; the site of an early capital of the Cachari R\u00e1j\u00e1s, the ruins and tanks of which are still to be found amid the jungle.\n\nThe following description of these ruins is quoted, in a somewhat condensed form, from the *Assam Administration Report* for 1880\u201381, pp. 233, 234:\u2014\u2018The site of the city is now overgrown with dense jungle, and till recently, when a small b\u00e1z\u00e1r was started, was entirely uninhabited. There are several splendid tanks of clear water, and a walled enclosure, supposed to have been a fort. The walls can be distinctly traced, and must originally have been upwards of 12 feet in height by 6 in width. They are built throughout of burnt brick of excellent quality. The enclosure is entered by a solid brick-built gateway with some pretensions to architectural beauty; it has a Moorish arch, and the stone hinges of the door are still visible, though all traces of woodwork have vanished. Much of the wall has fallen into decay, and the bricks falling on either side form a mass of d\u00e9bris, now covered with vegetable mould. The enclosure is as nearly as possible a perfect square, each side being about 800 yards in length. Two faces are further protected by a deep moat, and it is noticeable that these two are those farthest from the river; indeed, it seems probable that the builders of the structure refrained from continuing the moat on the two faces nearest the river, lest the stream might cut into them and undermine the foundations of the walls. Inside the fortification are three small ruined tanks, one of which has a flight of brick steps leading to where the water once was; and immediately to the back of it a ruined\nmass of brick and earth, with the remains of brick steps leading up to it. This is supposed to have been either an altar or a chabutra (raised platform) on which the R\u00e1j\u00e1s used to sit after bathing. The most interesting relics in the fort, however, are the monolithic pillars, one group of which, ranged in four rows of 15 each, stands not far from the gateway, on the left hand, and another smaller group at a little distance on the right. Of the first group, two rows consist of mushroom-shaped pillars with rounded heads, and the other two of square pillars of a very peculiar V-shape. All are richly covered with tracery of some artistic merit. For what purpose the round-headed pillars were erected it is impossible to say. They cannot have supported a roof, because they are of unequal heights, and the tracery with which they are covered extends over the whole head. The site has been so long deserted, and the people whose capital it once was are so widely scattered, that no trustworthy traditions have survived to explain the uses of the building. There is nowhere any trace of inscriptions or written character of any kind. At present, with the exception of the site of the pillars, where the trees have been cut down, the whole interior of the fort is covered with dense jungle; and when the undergrowth is cleared, other relics may possibly be brought to light.\n\nDim\u00e1pur is now a police outpost, and the centre of some trade with the N\u00e1g\u00e1s, as the river is navigable up to this point by country boats. All around is wild jungle.\n\n**Din\u00e1jpur.**\u2014The District of Din\u00e1jpur occupies the west of the R\u00e1jsh\u00e1h\u00ed Kuch Behar Division, under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal. It lies between 24\u00b0 43\u2032 40\u2033 and 26\u00b0 22\u2032 50\u2033 N. lat., and between 88\u00b0 4\u2032 0\u2033 and 89\u00b0 21\u2032 5\u2033 E. long., being bounded roughly on the east by the Karataya, and on the west by the Mah\u00e1nand\u00e1 river. Area, 4118 square miles; population (1881) 1,514,346 souls. The administrative headquarters are at DINAJPUR Town, on the left bank of the Purn\u00e1bhab\u00e1.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The District exhibits a less uniformly level appearance than the rest of Northern Bengal. The plain that stretches from the Him\u00e1layas to the Ganges is here represented by a peculiar clay formation, locally known as khi\u00e1r, which is sufficiently stiff to resist the diluviating action of the rivers. In the southern part of the District, and again in the north-west along the Kulik river, this clay soil rises into undulating ridges, some of which attain the height of 100 feet. The entire country is intersected by numerous rivers, which run in well-defined channels and have deposited in their floods a later alluvium of sandy loam, called pali. The agriculture of the District is determined by the difference between these two kinds of soil. The river valleys are everywhere much wider than the narrow limits within which the streams are confined during the dry season. In the rains, the flood-water spreads out into large lakes, about 2 miles across; but there are\nfew permanent marshes of any size throughout the District. The clay ridges in the south are still much overgrown with scrub-jungle, which affords cover to numerous wild beasts, and yields little forest produce of any value.\n\nThe rivers in Din\u00e1jpur arrange themselves into two systems, one of which carries off the drainage southwards by the Mah\u00e1nand\u00e1 into Maldah District, while the other is connected with the old T\u00edst\u00e1 river, and flows in a south-easterly direction towards Bogr\u00e1 and R\u00e1jsh\u00e1h\u00ed. The MAHANANDA itself only skirts the western frontier of the District for about 30 miles; its chief tributaries are the NAGAR, TANGAN, and PURNABHARA. All these rivers are only navigable for large boats during the rains. They run through the khi\u00e1r country, along shallow valleys, bordered by elevated clay ridges. The TISTA river system has been much broken up by the violent changes which took place in the course of the main channel towards the close of the last century. The various channels of the old T\u00edst\u00e1 still flowing through Din\u00e1jpur are now known as the ATRAI, JAMUNA, and KARATAYA. Their value for boat traffic has been greatly lessened by the circumstance that the main volume of the water now finds its way eastwards into the Brahmaputra. There are several short artificial canals in the District; but some of them appear to have been dug with a view to facilitate religious processions, rather than as a means of assisting trade.\n\nSil woods occur throughout the District, but are principally found in small patches along the course of the Karataya river. These forests yield a considerable revenue to the landholders to whom they belong, but the trees generally are stunted in growth, and the timber is of inferior quality. The jungle products consist of beeswax, anant\u00e1mul and s\u00e1t\u00e1mul (vegetable drugs), and the flowers of a tree called sing\u00e1bh\u00e1r, from which a dye is made. Large breadths of pasture-land are scattered throughout the District. They pay no rent, and some of the peasantry engage in pasturing cattle in these tracts as an additional means of subsistence. The wild animals of the District comprise the tiger, leopard, civet cat, tiger cat, polecat, buffalo, wild hog, bar\u00e1 singha or large deer, hog deer, jackal, fox, mongoose, badger, crocodile, etc. Tigers mostly infest the den\u0161e, tangled jungle and grass patches; leopards are found everywhere, and numbers of cows and goats are annually destroyed by them; buffaloes and hog commit great havoc amongst the sugar-cane and rice cultivation. Game and other wild birds are plentiful, and fish of many varieties are numerous, the fisheries being of considerable value.\n\nHistory.\u2014Din\u00e1jpur District, with the rest of Bengal, passed under British rule in 1765, and has no independent history of its own.\n\nPopulation.\u2014In the beginning of the present century, Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton, in the course of his statistical inquiries, arrived at a most\nelaborate estimate of the population of Din\u00e1jpur. His calculations yielded a total of about 3 millions, or 558 persons to the square mile. The District was then about one-third larger than at present. During the Revenue Survey (1857\u201361), when the area of the District was also somewhat larger than now, the number of houses was counted, and the inhabitants living therein were estimated to number 1,042,832, or only 227 per square mile. It seems probable that this latter estimate was as much too low, as Dr. B. Hamilton's estimate must have been too high. The Census of 1872 disclosed a total population of 1,501,924 persons, on an area corresponding to that of the present District. In 1881, the Census returned the population at 1,514,346, showing an increase of 12,422, or less than 1 per cent., during the nine years from 1872 to 1881. This small increase is due to the ravages of malarious fever, for which the District has an evil reputation. The general results arrived at by the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\n\nArea of District, 4118 square miles, with 6921 towns and villages, and 272,368 houses, of which 268,647 were occupied and 3721 unoccupied. Total population 1,514,346, namely, males 782,292, and females 732,054; average density, 368 per square mile; villages per square mile, 1\u00b768; persons per village, 219; houses per square mile, 66\u00b714; inmates per house, 5\u00b764. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Hindus, 716,630; Muhammadans, 795,824; Christians, 457; and Sant\u00e1ls, still professing their aboriginal faith, 1435.\n\nThere can be no doubt that in Din\u00e1jpur, even to a greater extent than in the rest of Bengal, the great bulk of the people are of aboriginal descent; and that the majority became willing converts to the conquering faith of Isl\u00e1m, in preference to remaining out-castes beyond the pale of exclusive Hinduism. The tribes now ranked as aboriginal are poorly represented, numbering 23,355. They come from Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur to work on the roads or to clear jungle. Among them are the Bhumij, 6834; Sant\u00e1l, 6813; Kol, 316; Kharw\u00e1r, 213; Bhuinya, 45; and \u2018others,\u2019 9450. The semi-Hinduized aborigines, who are nearly twice as numerous as the Hindus proper, mostly consist of the kindred races of P\u00e1l\u00ed, R\u00e1jbansi, and Koch. These three tribes number collectively 407,923 of the Hindu population. The few who retain the name of Koch are palanquin-bearers; R\u00e1jbansi is the high-sounding title which they have adopted for themselves; whereas P\u00e1l\u00ed is the appellation applied to them by their neighbours. This last term is almost confined to Din\u00e1jpur and the adjoining District of Maldah; it would not be recognised in Kuch Behar State. Among Hindus proper, the Br\u00e1hmans number 8913; they are traditionally reported to have settled in the District within recent times. The R\u00e1jputs number only 2885; the K\u00e1yasths, 6024. By far the most numerous castes are the Kaibartta with 37,785, the Har\u00ed with 31,934, and the Baniy\u00e1 with 21,149.\nmembers; the fishing castes are also strongly represented, especially the J\u00e1liy\u00e1, with 13,560 members. The other castes with upwards of 5000 members are \u2014 N\u00e1pit, 12,735; T\u00e1nti, 9045; Chand\u00e1l, 7180; Dos\u00e1dh, 6000; Loh\u00e1r, 5725; Kumbh\u00e1r, 5352; Gw\u00e1l\u00e1, 5123; and Sunr\u00ed, 5096. The Br\u00e1hma Sam\u00e1j has a small body of followers at Din\u00e1jpur town, who are mostly engaged in Government service; and at the same place there are a few families of Jain merchants, immigrants from the north-west, with their servants and retainers. The Vaishnavs are returned at 19,349, which number only includes the professed religious mendicants; many of the P\u00e1li tribe are said to belong to this sect. The Muhammadans belong almost entirely to the agricultural class; few of them are landholders, and still fewer engage in trade. The reforming sect of Wah\u00e1b\u00eds or Far\u00e1iz\u00eds is known to have exercised some influence among them, but no active fanaticism exists. A little immigration into Din\u00e1jpur of a temporary character takes place every harvest season; emigration from the District there is none.\n\nThe entire population is absolutely rural. The only place returned in the Census Report as containing more than 5000 inhabitants is Din\u00e1jpur Town, population (1881) 12,560. The people display no tendency towards urban life, but rather the reverse. The trading marts consist merely of a line of gold\u00e1s or warehouses along the river banks, where agricultural produce can be conveniently stored until the rainy season opens the rivers for navigation. Out of a total of 6921 villages, as many as 4749 contain less than two hundred inhabitants each; 1544 from two to five hundred; 445 from five hundred to a thousand; 149 from one to two thousand; 26 from two to three thousand; 7 from three to five thousand; and 1 upwards of ten thousand inhabitants.\n\nAs regards the occupations of the people, the Census Report divides the male population into the following six main classes:\u2014Class (1) Professional, including military, civil, and all officers of Government, with the learned professions, 10,571; (2) domestic servants, and keepers of lodging-houses, etc., 29,776; (3) commercial, including merchants, traders, and carriers, 17,022; (4) agricultural, including cultivators, gardeners, and tenders of sheep and cattle, 393,589; (5) industrial class, comprising manufacturers and artisans, 41,359; (6) indefinite and unproductive, including general labourers, male children, and persons of no stated occupation, 289,975. Almost the whole population live by agriculture; even among the shopkeeper and artisan classes, nearly every household supplement their ordinary means of livelihood by cultivating a small patch of land, either by their own hands, or if sufficiently well off, through others, who receive a share of the crop in return for their labour. Generally speaking, a cultivator\u2019s entire holding is under rice, with the exception of a small patch around the homestead, on which he raises crops of vegetables. The material condition of the people is said\nto be, as a rule, superior to that of the peasantry of the more advanced Districts of the Gangetic delta, and the mode of living much more simple than in the Districts to the south. As a rule, every husbandman has more than one wife. The husband does all the work of the fields, while the wives stay at home and weave clothing or sackcloth, the surplus of which, after providing for home consumption, is disposed of at the nearest village market. The weaving of jute into gunny cloth is entirely a feminine occupation.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Rice constitutes the staple crop throughout the District. Of the total food-supply, the \u00e1man or winter crop, grown on low lands and usually transplanted, furnishes about 80 per cent.; the \u00e1us or autumn crop, grown on high lands, about 16 per cent.; the boro or spring crop, grown on the borders of marshes and rivers, in certain tracts about 4 per cent. This last is the only crop in the District which demands irrigation, and the water required is easily obtained from the immediate neighbourhood. Among miscellaneous crops may be mentioned maize and millet, pulses, oil-seeds, tobacco, jute, sugar-cane, p\u00e1n or betel leaf. The staples grown for export are rice and jute. The cultivation of sugar-cane is on the decline. Manure, in the form of cow-dung, is applied to khi\u00e1r rice lands, and to the more valuable crops grown on p\u00e1l\u00ed soil. Khi\u00e1r land is never allowed to lie fallow, but p\u00e1l\u00ed requires an occasional rest of about one year in every five. The principle of the rotation of crops is not known. There is still a good deal of spare land capable of cultivation, to be found in most parts of the District. Horned cattle are very abundant; but owing to the indifference shown in breeding, they are mostly of a poor class. There is abundance of the ordinary pasturage of Bengal in the District. The average produce of an acre of good rice land renting at 9s. is about 20 cwts. of rice, valued at \u00a31, 18s.; exceptionally good land will sometimes yield as much as 37 cwts. per acre. Khi\u00e1r land produces only one rice crop in the year; but from p\u00e1l\u00ed land a second crop of oil-seeds or pulses is obtained in the cold season, in addition to the \u00e1us rice. This cold-weather crop may be valued at from \u00a31, 10s. to \u00a32, 2s. per acre. The rate of rent paid for khi\u00e1r land varies from 9s. to 12s. an acre; p\u00e1l\u00ed land rents at from 6s. to \u00a31, 10s. There is little peculiarity in the land tenures of Dinajpur. It is estimated that over about five-eighths of the total area of the District the superior landlords have parted with their rights in favour of intermediate tenure-holders. Only a small fraction of the cultivators have won for themselves rights of occupancy by a continuous holding of more than twelve years; the great majority are mere tenants-at-will.\n\nThe following were the current rates of wages in 1881:\u2014Coolies and agricultural day-labourers received 6s. a month with food, or 10s. a month without food; bricklayers and carpenters, from 12s. to \u00a31, 10s.\na month; smiths, from 12s. to \u00a31. In the same year, the prices of food-grains were as follow:\u2014Common rice, 2s. 6d. per maund of 80 lbs.; common paddy or unhusked rice, 2s. per maund; barley, 4s. per maund; barley flour, 8s. per maund. The highest price reached by rice in 1866, the year of the Orissa famine, was 8s. per maund.\n\nDin\u00e1jpur is exceptionally free from either of the calamities of flood or drought. Owing to the rising of the rivers and the heavy local rainfall, a considerable portion of the District is annually laid under water; but this inundation is productive of good rather than harm. The single occasion on which the general harvest has been known to be injuriously affected, was in the autumn of 1873, when the protracted drought caused a failure of the \u00e1man rice crop, upon which the population almost entirely depends for its food-supply. It was only the prompt interference of Government that prevented scarcity from intensifying into famine, and \u00a3162,188 was expended on relief operations.\n\nFor the future, Din\u00e1jpur District will be saved from the danger of isolation by the Northern Bengal State Railway, opened a few years ago, which runs northward for about 30 miles through its eastern half, and which is being still further extended from east to west, passing through Din\u00e1jpur town. Roads are numerous, and traverse the District in all directions to the extent of 1200 miles. Another important means of communication are the rivers, which unfortunately are only navigable by large boats during three or four months in the year.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The whole population is so entirely agricultural, that scarcely any manufactures exist. Neither indigo nor silk is prepared, and the production of sugar has decreased since the beginning of this century. A little coarse cotton cloth is made for home use; and in some parts a durable fabric called mekli is woven from the wild rhea grass. Gunny cloth is manufactured to a considerable extent in the north of the District, this industry being chiefly confined to the women of the Koch tribe.\n\nUntil the opening of the railway, Din\u00e1jpur was almost entirely dependent upon its rivers for all its trade. The chief exports are rice, jute, tobacco, sugar, gunny cloth, and hides; the imports are piece-goods, salt, and hardware. The western half of the District, so far as the valley of the Purn\u00e1bhb\u00e1, exports its surplus rice towards Behar and the North-Western Provinces by means of the Mah\u00e1nand\u00e1; the eastern half uses the old channels of the T\u00edst\u00e1 and the Northern Bengal State Railway, and sends its produce direct to Calcutta. During the dry season, pack-bullocks and carts traverse the whole country, carrying the surplus rice to the river marts, to be there stored until the streams swell. The principal of these dep\u00f4ts are Nitpur, Chandganj, Bir\u00e1mpur, and P\u00e1tir\u00e1m. The most important centre of local buying and selling is\nthe Nekmard fair, which is held annually in honour of a Musalm\u00e1n saint, and attended by about 150,000 persons. Properly, it is a cattle fair, but traders frequent it with miscellaneous articles collected from the farthest corners of India. Lesser gatherings take place at Alaw\u00e1rkh\u00e1w\u00e1, Dhaldigh\u00ed, and Sont\u00e1pur. The registration returns of river traffic are only useful for Din\u00e1jpur in so far as they refer to the exports. The imports into the District are chiefly received overland, passing by routes that escape registration. For the year 1881-82 the exports were valued at \u00a3480,750, against imports worth only \u00a3172,000. The chief exports are\u2014Rice and paddy, 2,600,000 maunds, valued together at \u00a3325,000 (placing Din\u00e1jpur seventh in the list of rice-exporting Districts in Bengal); jute, 275,000 maunds, valued at \u00a368,750; gunny cloth, 600,000 pieces, valued at \u00a372,000; hides, 80,000 in number, valued at \u00a310,000; other exports valued at \u00a35000. The principal imports are\u2014salt, 160,000 maunds, valued at \u00a348,000; and European piece-goods, valued at \u00a380,000. Of the local marts, R\u00e1iganj stands first, with exports valued at \u00a347,300 (almost entirely jute and gunny-bags), and imports valued at \u00a312,000; N\u00edtpur exported \u00a340,000 (solely rice), and imported \u00a36000. Of the total quantity of rice, 1,400,000 maunds were consigned direct to Calcutta, and the remainder to Behar and the North-Western Provinces.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1870-71, the net revenue of Din\u00e1jpur District was \u00a3212,340, towards which the land-tax contributed \u00a3173,454, or 81 per cent.; the net expenditure amounted to \u00a336,839, or little more than one-sixth of the revenue. By 1881-82, the total net revenue had slightly decreased to \u00a3197,137, towards which the land-tax contributed \u00a3163,755, or a little over 83 per cent. The net expenditure amounted to \u00a337,376. The large proportion derived from the land revenue is to be explained by the circumstance that Din\u00e1jpur was in an exceptionally prosperous condition at the date of the Permanent Settlement. In 1881-82 there were 3 covenanted civil servants stationed in the District, and 7 magisterial and 9 civil and revenue courts open. For police purposes, Din\u00e1jpur is divided into 17 th\u00e1ns or police circles. In 1881 the regular police force numbered 385 men of all ranks, maintained at a total cost to Government of \u00a36680. In addition, there was a municipal police of 32 men, and a rural police or village watch of 5199 men, maintained by the villagers at an estimated cost in money and rent-free land of \u00a311,457. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property amounted to 5626 officers and men, giving 1 man to every '73 of a square mile of area, or to every 260 persons in the population. In 1881, the total number of persons convicted of any offence, great or small, amounted to 1250, or 1 person to every 1211 of the population. By far the greater number of the convictions were for petty offences. The District contains 1 jail at\nDin\u00e1jpur town. In 1881, the average daily number of prisoners was 175, of whom 4 were women; the labouring convicts averaged 145. These figures show 1 person in jail to every 8904 of the population.\n\nEducation has widely spread of recent years, owing to the changes by which the benefit of the grant-in-aid rules has been extended, first to the vernacular middle-class schools, and ultimately to the village schools or p\u00e1ths\u00e1l\u00e1s. In 1856 there were only 10 schools in the District, attended by 532 pupils. In 1860 both these numbers had actually decreased; but by 1870 the number of schools had risen to 247, and the pupils to 5723. In 1872 there was a further increase to 456 Government inspected schools and 8174 pupils; and in 1881\u201382, to 487 Government and aided schools, attended by 11,188 pupils, showing 1 school to every 8 square miles, and 7\u00b73 pupils to every 1000 of the population. The higher-class English school at Din\u00e1jpur town was attended by 185 pupils. There are also a number of private indigenous schools. The Census Report in 1881 returned 19,493 boys and 318 girls as under instruction; and 44,408 males and 430 females as able to read and write but not under instruction.\n\nUp to the close of 1883, the sub-divisional system of administration had not been extended to Din\u00e1jpur. The District is divided into the following 17 police circles:\u2014(1) Din\u00e1jpur, (2) R\u00e1jar\u00e1mpur, (3) B\u00edrganj, (4) Th\u00e1kurg\u00e1on, (5) R\u00e1n\u00edsankail, (6) P\u00edrganj, (7) Hemt\u00e1bd, (8) K\u00e1liganj, (9) Bansih\u00e1ri, (10) Patnit\u00e1la, (11) Mah\u00e1deo, (12) Porsh\u00e1, (13) Patir\u00e1m, (14) Gang\u00e1r\u00e1mpur, (15) Chint\u00e1man, (16) Parbat\u00edpur, and (17) Naw\u00e1bganj. The pargan\u00e1s or Fiscal Divisions are 81 in number, with an aggregate of 778 revenue-paying estates.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Din\u00e1jpur is considerably cooler than that of the Gangetic delta. The hot weather does not set in so early, and the temperature at night continues low until the end of April. During the winter months a heavy dew falls at night, and a thick mist hangs over the ground until dispelled by the morning sun. It has been observed that the hot season proves the least healthy to strangers, while the natives suffer most at the close of the rains. The average annual rainfall for a period of over 20 years is returned at 76\u00b783 inches. In 1881, the rainfall was 60\u00b732 inches, or 16\u00b751 inches below the average. The mean annual temperature is about 83\u00b75\u00b0 F.; the maximum being 104\u00b0 in the month of May, the minimum 63\u00b0 in December.\n\nThe principal diseases of the District are remittent and continued fevers, ague, enlargement of the spleen, bowel complaints, cholera, and small-pox. The outbreaks of small-pox are to be referred to the popular practice of inoculation. The District has a bad reputation for malarial fevers, which during the nine years from 1872 to 1881 kept down the increase of the population to less than 1 per cent. In 1872, the\nreported deaths from fever in Din\u00e1jpur were higher than in any other District of the Division. The four following years showed little improvement, and in 1876 the fever mortality was 22.05 per thousand of the whole population. In 1877, which a general consensus of opinion declares to have been the most unhealthy year in this District within living memory, over 30,000 deaths were reported from fevers alone. Out of seventeen adult Europeans, fifteen had to leave the District during the year, broken down by repeated attacks of fever, and official business could hardly be carried on. This terrible mortality drew renewed attention to the insanitary condition of the District, and a committee was appointed to report on the causes of this great unhealthiness and to suggest means for improving the health of the station. The investigations demonstrated the existence of a terrible amount of constant sickness and a very high death-rate. An examination of nearly a thousand individuals showed that nearly 75 per cent. of the inhabitants were in bad health, while 53 per cent. had marked enlargement of the spleen. It so happened that this District was at the time that in which death registration was best carried out in all Bengal; and it was found that the death-rate in the municipality was 42 per thousand, nearly double the death-rate of London, while the police died at the rate of 46, and the prisoners in jail at the rate of 74.6 per thousand. Eventually, a scheme was drawn up and carried out for draining the neighbourhood of Din\u00e1jpur town, which has been attended with beneficial results. A slight remission of fever followed in 1878 and 1879, but it returned with increased virulence in 1880. In 1881, the total registered deaths were returned at 29,403, or 21.50 per 1000 of the population. The real death-rate was no doubt much higher.\n\nThere were in 1881 eight charitable dispensaries in the District, namely, at Din\u00e1jpur town, R\u00e1iganj, Chur\u00e1man, Mah\u00e1deopur, and Bal\u00farghat, at which 322 in-door and 8843 out-door patients were treated during the year.

Population (1881) 12,560, namely, 6,407 Muham-madans, 6,059 Hindus, and 94 'others.' Area of town site, 3,200 acres. Din\u00e1jpur is the only municipality in the District, with a total revenue in 1881-82 of \u00a36,297, of which \u00a31,386 was derived from taxation, and the balance from other sources, chiefly receipts from municipal lands,\npublic gardens, etc., \u00a34651; and grant from provincial revenues, \u00a31500. Expenditure in 1881\u201382, \u00a37741.\n\n**Din\u00e1argar.**\u2014Town in Gurdaspur tahsil, Gurdaspur District, Punjab. Situated in lat. 32\u00b0 8' 15\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 31' E., on a low and swampy plain, the source of the river Kirran, whose malarious exhalations render the town unhealthy, and produce endemic fever. Population (1881) 5589, namely, 2842 Hindus, 2700 Muhammadans, 40 Sikhs, and 6 'others.' Derives its name from Ad\u00edna Beg, the opponent of the Sikhs in 1752. A dilapidated mud wall surrounds the town; the neighbourhood is profusely irrigated from the Bari Do\u00e1b Canal, and dense vegetation comes up to the very gates. Centre of trade in country produce; annual cattle fair during the Dasah\u00e1ra festival. Groves of mango and plum trees surround the town, which was the residence of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranj\u00edt Singh during the rainy season. The navigation canal runs close by the town. Head-quarters of a police sub-division (th\u00e1n\u00e1) and charitable dispensary. Lies on the main road from Amritsar to Path\u00e1nkot, 8 miles north-east of Gurd\u00e1sipur. Municipal revenue in 1882\u201383, \u00a3761; expenditure, \u00a3608; average incidence of taxation, 2s. 6\u00bdd. per head of the population.\n\n**Din\u00e1pur (D\u00e1n\u00e1pur).**\u2014Sub-division of Patn\u00e1 District, Bengal; situated between 25\u00b0 32' and 25\u00b0 44' N. lat., and between 84\u00b0 50' 15\" and 85\u00b0 7' E. long. Area, 143 square miles; number of villages, 349; houses, 27,041. Total population (1881) 166,128, namely, 78,503 males and 87,625 females. Hindus numbered 140,013; Muhammadans, 24,122; Christians, 1985; and Jews, 8. Average number of persons per square mile, 1162; villages per square mile, 2\u00b744; persons per village, 476; houses per square mile, 211; inmates per house, 6\u00b71. The Sub-division comprises the police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) of Din\u00e1pur and M\u00e1n\u00e9r. It contains 1 civil and 3 criminal courts; strength of regular police, 180 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 244.\n\n**Din\u00e1pur (D\u00e1n\u00e1pur).**\u2014Cantonment and military head-quarters of Patn\u00e1 District, Bengal, in the Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d Military Division; situated on the right or south bank of the Ganges, in lat. 25\u00b0 38' 19\" N., long. 85\u00b0 5' 8\" E. Divided into two parts, the Cantonments and the Niz\u00e1mat or municipal area. Population (1881) of the Cantonment and the town proper, 37,893, namely, Hindus, 26,513; Muhammadans, 9700; Christians and 'others,' 1680; area, 5884 acres. Municipal income (1882\u201382), \u00a3873, of which \u00a3839 was derived from taxation, or at the rate of 8\u00bdd. per head of the population (23,740) within municipal limits. The military force quartered at Din\u00e1pur in September 1883 consisted of 2 European and 1 Native infantry regiment, with 2 batteries of Royal Artillery. The cantonment magistrate administers the whole Din\u00e1pur Sub-division. The road from Din\u00e1pur to B\u00e1nkipur, the civil head-quarters of Patn\u00e1 District, 6 miles in length, is lined throughout with houses and\ncottages; in fact, Din\u00e1pur, B\u00e1nkipur, and Patn\u00e1 may be regarded as forming one continuous narrow city hemmed in between the Ganges and the railway.\n\nThe Mutiny of 1857, in Patn\u00e1 District, originated at Din\u00e1pur. The three Sepoy regiments stationed there broke into open revolt in July, and went off *en masse*, taking only their arms and accoutrements with them. Thus lightly equipped, the majority effected their escape into Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, a friendly country, with nothing to oppose them but the courage of a handful of English civilians, indigo planters, and railway engineers. A reinforcement was sent from the European garrison of Din\u00e1pur to aid in the defence of Arrah, which was shortly after besieged by the rebel Sepoys. The expedition failed disastrously, but individual acts of heroism saved the honour of the British name. Two volunteers, Mr. Fraser M'Donell and Mr. Ross Mangles, both of the Civil Service, conspicuously distinguished themselves by acts of intrepid valour. The former, although wounded, was one of the last men to enter the boats. The insurgents had taken the oars of his boat and had lashed the rudder, so that although the wind was favourable for retreat, the current carried it back to the river bank. Thirty-five soldiers were in the boat, sheltered from fire by the usual thatch covering; but while the rudder was being fixed, the inmates remained at the mercy of the enemy. At this crisis, Mr. Fraser M'Donell stepped out from the shelter, climbed on to the roof of the boat, perched himself on the rudder, and cut the lashings amidst a storm of bullets from the contiguous bank. Strangely enough, not a ball struck him; the rudder was loosened, the boat answered to the helm, and by Mr. M'Donell's brilliant act the crew were saved from certain destruction. Mr. Ross Mangles' conduct was equally heroic. During the retreat, a soldier was struck down near him. He stopped, lifted the man on to his back, and though he had frequently to rest on the way, he managed to carry the wounded man for 6 miles, till he reached the stream. He then swam with his helpless burden to a boat, in which he deposited him in safety. Both these civilians afterwards received the Victoria Cross as a reward for their valour.\n\n**Dindigal (Dind\u00fa-kal).\u2014T\u00e1luk or Sub-division of Madura District, Madras Presidency; area, 1132 square miles, containing 1 town and 208 villages; number of houses, 52,527; population (1881) 304,783, namely, 147,736 males and 157,047 females. Classified according to religion\u2014Hindus, 272,679; Muhammadans, 12,239; and Christians, 19,865, of whom 17,166 are native Roman Catholics. Formerly a separate Province, though subject to Madura, it was ceded by the treaty of 1792 to the East India Company. It is watered by the Kodavar, Mageri, and other streams, and contains also 1542 tanks, with abundance of fish. A pearl-bearing mussel is said to have been once found here. Among the\nvegetable products are enumerated \u2018croton, sarsaparilla, and senna, the last equal to that brought from Egypt.\u2019 The ironworks at G\u00fatum and Kalampetti were once of considerable importance. In 1883 the taluk contained 1 civil and 3 criminal courts; number of police circles, 15; strength of regular police, 122 men. Land revenue, \u00a335,446. Chief town, DINDIGAL.\n\n**Dindigal** (Dind\u00fa-kal, \u2018The Rock of Dindu,\u2019 an Asura or demon).\u2014Town in the Dindigal taluk, Madura District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 10\u00b0 21' 39\" N., long. 78\u00b0 0' 17\" E. Number of houses, 2115. Population (1881) 14,182, namely, Hindus, 10,484; Muhammadans, 1601; and Christians, 2097; about 15 per cent. of the whole are weavers, 18 per cent. traders, and 13 per cent. agriculturists. Formerly the Christians lived in a separate quarter, their houses being distinguished by a cross on the roof. Their priest was a native of Malab\u00e1r, subject ecclesiastically to the Bishop of Cannanore. Situated 880 feet above the sea, about 54 miles from Kod\u00e1ikanal, the sanitarium on the Palani Hills, and 40 from Madura. Dindigal is connected by railway with the chief towns of the Presidency. The staples of local trade are hides, tobacco, coffee, and cardamoms, for the export of which the system of roads radiating from the town afford exceptional facilities. The silks and muslins manufactured here had once a high repute, as had also the blankets made from \u2018Carumba\u2019 wool. As the head-quarters of the Sub-division, Dindigal contains the courts of European as well as native officials, police and telegraph stations, travellers\u2019 bungalow, school, dispensary, and post-office. There are two churches, the one Protestant and the other Roman Catholic. The municipal revenue for 1882\u201383 was \u00a31173, the incidence of taxation being 1s. per head of the population.\n\nDindigal was formerly the capital of an independent Province, which nominally formed part of the Madura kingdom. The fort, built on a remarkable wedge-shaped rock 1223 feet above the sea, to the west of the town, remains in good preservation, having been occupied by a British garrison until 1860. As a strategical point of great natural strength, commanding the passes between Madura and Coimbatore, its possession has always been keenly contested. Between 1623 and 1659 it was the scene of many encounters between the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and the Mysore and Madura troops, the p\u00e1leg\u00e1r of Dindigal holding at that time feudal authority over eighteen neighbouring chieftains. Ch\u00e1nda S\u00e1hib, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and the Mysore troops occupied the fort in turn, and during the intervals in which no greater power was in possession, the strongest local chief made it his head-quarters. In 1755, however, Haidar Al\u00ed garrisoned Dindigal, and, while still ostensibly the faithful soldier of Mysore, used it as the basis of his schemes for distant conquest and self-aggrandisement, subduing\nin succession the powerful p\u00e2leg\u00e2rs of Madura, and annexing the greater part of that District, as well as Coimbatore, to his fief. As the gate to Coimbatore from the south, the fort proved, in the wars with Haidar, a serious obstacle to the operations of the British troops at Trichinopoli and Madura. It was taken by the British in 1767, lost again in 1768, retaken in 1783, given up to Mysore by the treaty of Mangalore in 1784, recaptured on the next outbreak of war in 1790, and finally ceded to the East India Company by the treaty of 1792.\n\n**Dindivaram** *(Tindivaram).*\u2014T\u00e2luk or Sub-division of South Arcot District, Madras Presidency. Area, 844 square miles, of which about four-fifths are cultivated or cultivable, yielding a revenue of \u00a354,655. Number of villages, 564; number of houses, 33,559. Population (1881) 264,261, namely, Hindus, 248,377; Muhammadans, 5888; Christians (native Roman Catholics), 6369; 'others,' 3627. The t\u00e2luk contains 3 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e2n\u00e2s), 13; regular police, 116 men. Twenty-two miles distant from Dindivaram, the chief town, lies Merkanam, a small sub-port with little or no trade. The South Indian Railway runs through the t\u00e2luk from north to south for about 17 miles, with 3 railway stations. Chief places, Dindivaram and Gingi.\n\n**Dindori.**\u2014Sub-division of N\u00e2sik District, Bombay Presidency. Bounded on the north by Kalvan and the Sapt\u00e2shring hills; on the east by Ch\u00e2ndor and Niph\u00e2d; on the south by N\u00e2sik Sub-division; and on the west by the Sahy\u00e2dri hills and Peint. Area, 529 square miles; number of villages, 128. Population (1881) 72,290, namely, 36,052 males and 36,238 females. Density of population, 137 persons to the square mile. Hindus number 70,165; Muhamma\u00e2ns, 1210; 'others,' 915. Most of the Sub-division is hilly. In the north and west there are only a few cart tracks, and travelling is difficult. A fair road leads to Bals\u00e2r through the S\u00e2val pass, and to Kalvan through the Aivan pass. Rainfall abundant; clinate in April and May healthy, in other months feverish. Average rainfall for 12 years ending 1881, 26 inches. The main stream is the K\u00e2dva, used as well as the B\u00e2ngang\u00e2 for irrigation. In 1880\u201381 there were 6886 holdings in the Sub-division, with an average extent of 30\u00b75 acres, and paying an average rental of \u00a32, 2s. 6d. The area under actual cultivation was 153,287 acres; 37,195 acres were under wheat; 23,399 acres under n\u00e2gli (Eleusine corocana); 14,592 acres under b\u00e2jra; other crops, rice, pulses, and Bombay hemp. The Sub-division contains 2 criminal courts; 1 police circle (th\u00e2nd); regular police, 26 men; village watch (chaukid\u00e2rs), 150; land revenue, \u00a315,387.\n\n**Dindori.**\u2014Chief town of the Dindori Sub-division, N\u00e2sik District, Bombay Presidency. Population (1881) 2794. Situated about 15 miles north of N\u00e2sik. Besides the ordinary sub-divisional revenue and\npolice offices, the town is provided with a post-office and dispensary. In 1881, the number of patients treated was 4500.\n\n**Dingarh Kiner.**\u2014Village in Sirmur (Sarmor) State, Punjab. Lat. 30\u00b0 44' N., long. 77\u00b0 21' E. Stands on a picturesque site, in the gorge traversed by the route from N\u00e1han to R\u00e1jgarh. Northwards, it looks towards the Chaur (Chor) mountain; southwards, along the valley of the Jal\u00e1l river. Well-built flat-roofed houses, arranged in rows on the solid limestone ledges of the mountain in its rear. The surrounding country, though rocky, contains some fertile spots, which produce luxuriant crops of wheat.\n\n**Dingi.**\u2014Fort (with walls 15 feet high) in Khairpur Native State, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 26\u00b0 52' N., long. 68\u00b0 40' E. The rendezvous of the forces of the M\u00edrs in 1843. Water-supply abundant.\n\n**Dingier** (pronounced D\u00fcng-yeh).\u2014Range of mountains in the Kh\u00e1si and J\u00e1intia Hills District, Assam. The highest peak is 6400 feet above sea-level. The range takes its name from a mythical tree (Dung-tree), which, according to Kh\u00e1si legend, grew here in ancient times and reached up to heaven. The fable says that the tree was destroyed by God on account of the impiety of men who essayed to invade heaven by climbing up its branches.\n\n**Diodar.**\u2014State in the P\u00e1lanpur Agency, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See DEODAR.\n\n**Dip\u00e1lpur.**\u2014Tahs\u00edl of Montgomery District, Punjab. Area, 956 square miles, about one-third being under cultivation, one-half of which is irrigated by canals. The remainder consists for the most part of desert waste, portions of which are being slowly reclaimed under the influence of settled Government. Population (1881) 154,590, namely, males 83,549, and females 71,041; average density, 162 persons per square mile. Muhammadans numbered 118,126; Hindus, 30,379; Sikhs, 6068; 'others,' 17. Revenue, \u00a324,107. The administrative staff consists of a tahs\u00edld\u00e1r and an honorary magistrate, who preside over 2 civil and 2 criminal courts. Number of police circles, 4; strength of regular police, 57 men; village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 147.\n\n**Dip\u00e1lpur.**\u2014Ancient and decayed town in Montgomery District, Punjab; head-quarters of the Dip\u00e1lpur tahs\u00edl. Situated upon the old bank of the Beas (Bi\u00e1s), 17 miles from the railway station of Okh\u00e1ra and 28 miles north-east of P\u00e1kpattan. Population (1881) 3435, namely, Muhammadans, 2124; Hindus, 1194; Sikhs, 113; and 'others,' 4; number of houses, 639. A third-class municipality, with an income in 1882-83 of \u00a3243; expenditure, \u00a3248. Dip\u00e1lpur, now an insignificant village, once formed the capital of the Northern Punjab under the Path\u00e1n Emperors of Delhi; and even as late as the 16th century, B\u00e1bar mentions it as the sister city of Lahore. General Cunningham attributes its foundation to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Deva P\u00e1l,\nwhose date is lost in immemorial antiquity. Tradition, however, ascribes the origin of Dip\u00e1lpur to one B\u00edja Ch\u00e1nd, a Kshatriy\u00e1, from whose son it derived its earliest name of Sr\u00edpur. Old coins of the Indo-Scythian kings have been frequently discovered upon the site; and General Cunningham believes that the mound on which the village stands may be identified with the Daidala of Ptolemy. Firoz Tughlak visited the city in the 14th century, and built a large mosque outside the walls, besides drawing a canal from the Sutlej to irrigate the surrounding lands. At the time of Tim\u00far\u2019s invasion, Dip\u00e1lpur ranked second to Mult\u00e1n (Mooltan) alone, and contained, according to popular calculation, the symmetrical number of 84 towers, 84 mosques, and 84 wells. At the present day, only a single inhabited street runs between the two gates. A high ruined mound on the south-west, connected with the town by a bridge of three arches, probably marks the site of the ancient citadel. The walls apparently completed a circuit of $2\\frac{1}{2}$ miles, but suburbs stretched around in every direction, and may still be traced by straggling mounds and fields strewn with bricks. The decay of the town must be attributed to the drying up of the old Beas (Bi\u00e1s), after which event many of the inhabitants migrated to Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) in the Deccan. The restoration of the Kh\u00e1nwa Canal, since the British annexation, has partially revived the prosperity of Dip\u00e1lpur as a local trade centre. Tahs\u00edli, police station, sar\u00e1i.\n\n**Dip\u00e1lpur.**\u2014Town in Indore (Holkar\u2019s territory), Central India; situated in lat. $22\u00b0 51' N.$, and long. $75\u00b0 35' E.$, on the route from Mhow (Mau) to Neemuch (N\u00edmach), 27 miles north-west of the former, and 128 south-east of the latter. A tank to the east of the town irrigates a large area of ground in the neighbourhood.\n\n**Dipla.**\u2014T\u00e1luk in the Thar and P\u00e1rkar District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Lat. $24\u00b0 16'$ to $24\u00b0 57' 15'' N.$, and long. $69\u00b0 5' 30''$ to $69\u00b0 45' E.$ Population (1881) 17,114, namely, males 9498, and females 7616, dwelling in 4 villages and occupying 2987 houses. Hindus number 2291; Muhammadans, 11,548; Sikhs, 13; and aboriginal tribes, 3262. Area under cultivation, 15,804 acres. Revenue (1881\u201382) \u00a33383, of which \u00a33332 was derived from imperial and \u00a351 from local sources.\n\n**Dipla.**\u2014Chief town in Dipla t\u00e1luk, Thar and P\u00e1rkar District, Sind, Bombay Presidency.

The municipal revenue in 1873\u201374 was \u00a378, but the municipality was abolished in 1878, on the introduction into Sind of Bombay Act vi. of 1873. Head-quarters of a m\u00fakhi\u00e1r\u00e1kar. Ruined fort, built about 1790.\n\n**Dir\u00e1pur.**\u2014Tahsil of Cawnpur District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Derapur.\n\n**Dis\u00e1 (Deesa).**\u2014Town and cantonment in P\u00e1lanpur State, Gujar\u00e1t,\nBombay Presidency; situated on the river B\u00e1nas, in lat. $24^\\circ 14' 30''$ N., and long. $72^\\circ 12' 30''$ E., about 301 miles north-west of Mau (Mhow), 251 west by south of Nimach (Neemuch), and 390 north by west of Bombay. Population (1881) 8376, namely, Hindus, 5357; Muhammadans, 2455; 'others,' 564. Anciently the town was called Farid\u00e1b\u00e1d. The British cantonment (containing 4546 out of the total population) is stationed on the left bank of the Ban\u00e1s, 3 miles north-east of the native town. The force consisted in 1880 of a regiment of Native cavalry, a regiment of Native infantry, a British regiment, and a battery of artillery. A Brigadier-General holds command. Post and telegraph offices. D\u00eds\u00e1 is surrounded with a wall and towers, now in ruins. In former times it successfully resisted the attacks of the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda and of the R\u00e1dhanpur forces.\n\n**Disaun.**\u2014River of Central India.\u2014See Dhasan.\n\n**Disoi (Disai).**\u2014River in Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r District, Assam; rising in the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills, and flowing northwards into the Gela bhil, which communicates with the Brahmaputra near Nigiritting. This river formerly discharged itself into the Brahmaputra direct at Kokil\u00e1m\u00fakh, but has latterly changed its course. On its left bank is Jorh\u00e1t, the most important mart in the District, but its importance as a river port has much diminished since the change in the course of the Disoi. Goods landed at Kukil\u00e1m\u00fakh have to be conveyed to Jorh\u00e1t on carts; but a tramway is now (1882) under construction from Jorh\u00e1t to Goh\u00e1mg\u00e1on, a mile distant from Din\u00e1g\u00e1on on the Brahmaputra, which is a stopping-place for steamers in the rainy season.\n\n**Diu.**\u2014An island forming portion of the Portuguese possessions in Western India; situated in lat. $20^\\circ 43' 20''$ N., and long. $71^\\circ 2' 30''$ E., and separated by a narrow channel through a considerable swamp from the southern extremity of the peninsula of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r in the Bombay Presidency. Its extreme length from east to west is about 7 miles, and its greatest breadth from north to south 2 miles. Area, 52.5 square kilometres. On the north the narrow channel separating it from the mainland is practicable only for fishing boats and small craft. On the south, the face of the island is a sandstone cliff washed by the sea, with deep water close beneath. Several groves of cocoa-nut trees are scattered over the island, and the hills attain an elevation of about 100 feet. It has a small but excellent harbour, where vessels can safely ride at anchor in 2 fathoms of water. The climate is generally dry and sultry, the soil barren, and water scarce. Agriculture is much neglected. The principal products are\u2014wheat, millet, n\u00e1chni, b\u00e1jra, cocoa-nuts, and some kinds of fruit. The entire population of Diu island, according to the Census of 1881, numbered 6229 males and 6407 females; total, 12,636 persons, of whom 303 are Christians, including 4 Europeans.\nThe town of Diu stands at the east end of the island, the castle being in lat. $20^\\circ 42'$ N., and long. $70^\\circ 59'$ E.; distance from Nawa Bandar, 5 miles. In the days of its commercial prosperity, the town alone is said to have contained above 50,000 inhabitants. There are now 2929 houses, which, with very few exceptions, are poorly constructed. Some of the dwellings are provided with cisterns, of which there are altogether about 300, for the accumulation of rain-water. Diu, once so opulent and famous for its commerce, has now dwindled into utter insignificance. Not long ago, it maintained mercantile relations with several parts of India and Mozambique, but at present its trade is almost stagnant. The castle is separated from the other fortifications by a deep moat cut through the solid sandstone rock, through which the sea had free passage at one time, but now it only enters at the highest tides. Besides Diu town, there are 3 large villages on the island, namely\u2014Monakbara, with a fort commanding the channel on the west; Bachawara, on the north; and Nagwa, with a small fort commanding the bay, on the south. The principal occupations of the inhabitants were formerly weaving and dyeing, and articles manufactured here were highly prized in foreign markets. At present, fishing affords the chief employment to the impoverished inhabitants. A few enterprising persons, however, emigrate temporarily to Mozambique, where they occupy themselves in commercial pursuits, and, after making a sufficient fortune, return to their native place to spend the evening of their lives. The total revenue of Diu in 1873-74 was \u00a33802.\n\nThe Governor is the chief authority in both the civil and military departments, subordinate to the Governor-General of Goa. The judicial department is under a Juiz de Direito, with a small establishment to carry out his orders. For ecclesiastical purposes, the island is divided into two parishes, called Se Matriz and Brancawara, the patron saints being St. Paul and St. Andrew. Both parishes are under the spiritual jurisdiction of a dignitary styled the Prior, appointed by the Archbishop of Goa. The office of Governor is invariably filled by a European, other posts being bestowed on natives of Goa. The public force consisted in 1874 of 97 soldiers, including officers. The present fortress of Diu was reconstructed, with several later improvements, after the siege of 1545, by Dom Joao de Castro. It is an imposing structure, situated on the extreme east of the island, and defended by several pieces of cannon, some of which are made of bronze, and appear to be in good preservation. It is surrounded by a permanent bridge and entered by a gateway, which bears a Portuguese inscription, and is defended by a bastion called St. George. Towards the west of the fortress lies the town of Diu, divided into two quarters, the pagan and the Christian. The former comprehends\ntwo-thirds of the total area, and is intersected by narrow and crooked roads, lined with houses. Besides the villages of the island already named, the Portuguese possess the village of Gogola, towards the north, in the K\u00e1thi\u00e1war peninsula, and the fort of Simbor, conquered in 1722, and situated in an islet about 12 miles distant from the town.\n\nDiu town was formerly embellished with several magnificent edifices, some of which are still in existence. Of these the most noteworthy is the college of the Jesuits, erected in 1601, and now converted into a cathedral, called Se Matriz. Of the former convents, that of St. Francis is used as a military hospital; that of St. John of God, as a place of burial; that of St. Dominic is in ruins. The parochial hall of the once beautiful church of St. Thomas serves as a place of meeting for the municipal chamber. The mint, where, in the days of the greatest prosperity of the Portuguese, money of every species used to be coined, is now gradually falling into decay. The arsenal, once so renowned, contains a few insignificant military stores. Besides these buildings, there are the Governor's palace, a prison, and a school. The Hindus possess 10 small temples, and the Muhammadans 2 mosques, one of which is in good condition.\n\nOwing to the great advantages which the position of Diu afforded for trade with Arabia and the Persian Gulf, the Portuguese were fired from an early period with the desire of becoming masters of this island; but it was not until the time of Nuno da Cunha that they succeeded in obtaining a footing in it. When Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h, King of Gujar\u00e1t, was attacked by the Mughal Emperor Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, he concluded a defensive alliance with the Portuguese, allowing them to construct, in 1535, a fortress in the island, and garrison it with their own troops. This alliance continued till 1536, when both parties began to suspect each other of treachery. In a scuffle which took place on his return from a Portuguese ship, whither he had proceeded on a visit to Nuno da Cunha, the Gujar\u00e1t monarch met his death in 1537. In the following year, the fortress was besieged by Muhammad III., nephew of Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h; but the garrison, commanded by Antonio de Silveira, foiled the attempts of the enemy, and compelled him to raise the siege. Subsequently, in 1545, Diu was again closely invested by the same ruler; but was obstinately defended by the gallant band within, under the command of Dom Joao Mascarewas. While the Muhammadans were still under the walls, Dom Joao de Castro landed in the island with large reinforcements, and immediately marching to the relief of the place, totally routed the army of the King of Gujar\u00e1t in a pitched battle. This heroic defence, and the signal victory gained by Castro, which form a brilliant page in the annals of the Portuguese empire in the East, were followed by the acquisition of the entire island. In\n1670, a small armed band of the Arabs of Muscat surprised and plundered the fortress, retiring to their country with the booty they had acquired. Since this event, nothing worthy of note has occurred in connection with the Portuguese settlement.\n\n**Div\u00ed Point.**\u2014A low headland in the Bandar *t\u00e1luk* (Masulipatam), Kistna District, Madras Presidency; situated in lat. $15\u00b0\\ 57' \\ 30''$ N., and long. $81\u00b0\\ 14'$ E., at the mouth of one of the branch outlets of the Kistna river, and surrounded by shoal flats for 6 miles south and east, the edge of the shoal sometimes extending 5 or 6 leagues out to sea. A dioptric light on a column 43 feet high marks the danger. 'Div\u00ed False Point' stands $16\\frac{1}{2}$ miles south-west by west of 'Div\u00ed Point.'\n\n**Diw\u00e1la.**\u2014Village in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces.\u2014See DEWALA.\n\n**Diw\u00e1lg\u00e1on.**\u2014Village in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces.\u2014See DEWALGAON.\n\n**Diw\u00e1lg\u00e1on R\u00e1j\u00e1.**\u2014Town in Buld\u00e1n\u00e1 District, Ber\u00e1r.\u2014See DEULGAON RAJA.\n\n**Diw\u00e1lgh\u00e1t.**\u2014Town in Buld\u00e1n\u00e1 District, Ber\u00e1r.\u2014See DEULGHAT.\n\n**Diw\u00e1li\u00e1.**\u2014Petty State in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See DEWALIA.\n\n**Diwalw\u00e1r\u00e1.**\u2014Village in Wardh\u00e1, Central Provinces.\u2014See DEWALWARA.\n\n**Diwalw\u00e1r\u00e1.**\u2014Ruined town in Ellichpur District, Ber\u00e1r.\u2014See DEWALWARA.\n\n**Diw\u00e1ngir\u00ed.**\u2014Village in the north of Kamr\u00fap District, Assam; situated in lat. $26\u00b0\\ 51'$ N., and long. $91\u00b0\\ 27'$ E., 8 miles from the plains, on the lower range of the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n Hills. The village contains an old fort, formerly occupied by a Bhuti\u00e1 governor, known as the Diw\u00e1ngir\u00ed R\u00e1j\u00e1. A British detachment received a check at Diw\u00e1ngir\u00ed during the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n War of 1864\u201365, and the tract to which the fort belongs was annexed to British territory at the conclusion of the campaign. It is inhabited permanently by a few Bhuti\u00e1 settlers. In the cold weather the place is visited by Bhuti\u00e1s from beyond the frontier in considerable numbers, who bring with them large herds of magnificent cattle to feed on the rich pasturage of the lower ranges of hills and the adjacent plains. They also trade with the villages in the neighbourhood, and with M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri and other shopkeepers who establish themselves there for the season. The chief articles of import are blankets, ponies, yak\u2019s tails, knives, and dogs, which are exchanged for rice, dried fish, coarse silks, etc. A large fair is held annually at Diw\u00e1ngir\u00ed in the cold season.\n\n**Diw\u00e1s.**\u2014Native State in Central India.\u2014See DEWAS.\n\n**Diying.**\u2014River in North Cachar, Assam, rising in the B\u00e1rel range, and flowing a generally northerly course till it fails into the Kopili\nshortly after the latter stream issues from the hills. The Diying for a considerable portion of its course formed till recently the western boundary of the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills District; but by a notification issued in July 1882, another boundary drawn farther east was fixed between North Cachar and the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills.\n\n**Do\u00e1b** (*Du\u00e1b*, or two rivers).\u2014A tract of country in the North-Western Provinces, comprising the long and narrow strip of land between the Ganges and the Jumna, from the Siw\u00e1l\u00edk range south-eastward. The name properly applies to any wedge-shaped tract enclosed by confluant rivers, but it is especially employed to designate this great alluvial plain, the granary of Upper India. The Do\u00e1b includes the British Districts of Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, parts of Muttra, and Agra, Etah, Mainpuri, the greater portion of Etawah, and Farukhabad, Cawnpur, Fatehpur, and part of Allahabad,\u2014all of which see separately. Naturally a rich tract, composed of the detritus brought down from the Him\u00e1layan system by its great boundary rivers, the Do\u00e1b has been fertilized and irrigated by three magnificent engineering works, the Ganges, the Lower Ganges, and the Eastern Jumna Canals. Throughout its entire length it presents an almost unbroken sheet of cultivation, varied only by a few ravines along the banks of the principal streams and their tributaries, or by occasional patches of barren *\u00fasar* plain, covered with the white saline efflorescence known as *reh*. It supports a dense population, most of whom derive their subsistence from agriculture. Allahabad, Cawnpur, Meerut, and Aligarh are the chief commercial centres, and the principal stations of the civil and military authorities. The East Indian Railway enters the Do\u00e1b at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, and passes through the heart of the tract, by Cawnpur, Etawah, and Aligarh, to Delhi on the opposite shore of the Jumna. A branch line also runs across the river to Agra. The Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway continues the East Indian line from Gh\u00e1z\u00ed\u00e1b\u00e1d Junction, nearly opposite Delhi, by Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, and Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, to Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 (Umballa) and the other Punjab towns. Other lines of railway to connect with the main lines, namely, the H\u00e1thras and Muttra, and the Cawnpur and Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d lines, have been lately constructed as provincial light railways, on the metre gauge, through this tract. An extension of the Cawnpur and Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d line to H\u00e1thras, 103 miles in length, has been sanctioned by the Secretary of State; and a further line is projected from Bareli to K\u00e1sganj, but not yet (1883) commenced. The Do\u00e1b thus possesses unrivalled means of communication, both by land and water, with all the neighbouring tracts; and its surplus grain can be transported in almost every direction, upon any pressure of scarcity or famine. Three principal divisions are commonly recognised; the Upper Do\u00e1b, from Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur to Al\u00edgarh; the Middle Do\u00e1b, from Muttra and Etah to\nEt\u00e1wah and Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d; and the Lower Do\u00e1b, from Cawnpur to the junction of the two rivers at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. For history, inhabitants, and other particulars, see the various Districts separately.\n\n**Do\u00e1ba D\u00e1\u00fadzai.**\u2014Tahsil of Pesh\u00e1war District, Punjab. Area, 182 square miles. Population (1881) 68,902, namely, males 37,955, and females 30,947; average density, 378 persons per square mile. Muhammadans numbered 66,754; Hindus, 1954; Sikhs, 185; 'others,' 9. The tahsil includes two tracts, formerly constituting separate tahsils, Do\u00e1ba to the north-east, and D\u00e1\u00fadzai to the south-west. The Adizai, or northern branch of the K\u00e1b\u00fal or N\u00e1gam\u00e1n river, takes off near Fort Michni at the point of its entrance into the District, while the Sh\u00e1h Alim or southern branch leaves it a little lower down; both rejoin the main stream at its junction with the Sw\u00e1t river. Do\u00e1ba is the tract between the Sw\u00e1t and Adizai rivers; while D\u00e1\u00fadzai includes the area between the Adizai and Sh\u00e1h Alim, as well as a triangle of land abutting on the latter. Do\u00e1ba is occupied by the Gigi\u00e1ni Path\u00e1ns, and contains the two forts of Michni and Shankargarh. The Halimzai Mohmands have a large settlement at Panjpao, and the Tarakzai Mohmands a similar one near Fort Michni. Both clans belong to the independent Mohmands beyond our border, and pay merely a nominal revenue. D\u00e1\u00fadzai is occupied by the D\u00e1\u00fadzai Path\u00e1ns. The tahsil is located at the village of N\u00e1huki between the K\u00e1b\u00fal river and its Sh\u00e1h Alim branch. The old Do\u00e1ba tahsil at Shabkadr has been abolished. Irrigation by canals from the K\u00e1b\u00fal and Sw\u00e1t rivers make the tract very fertile. Revenue (1883), \u00a316,676. The administrative officer is a tahsild\u00e1r, who presides over 1 civil and 1 criminal court. Number of police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 2; strength of regular police, 38 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 180.\n\n**Dobbili.**\u2014Zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri in Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See BOBBILI.\n\n**Dobhi.**\u2014Village in G\u00e1darwar\u00e1 tahsil, Narsinghpur District, Central Provinces.

In 1883, the t\u00e1luk contained 1 criminal court; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 8; regular police, 64 men; village watch (chaukid\u00e1rs), 314.\nDod-ball\u00e1pur (Great Ball\u00e1pur, to distinguish it from Chik-ball\u00e1pur).\u2014Town in Bangalore District, Mysore State, on the right bank of the Arkavat\u00ed river. Lat. $13^\\circ 13' 40''$ N., long. $77^\\circ 22' 50''$ E.; 27 miles by road north-west of Bangalore. Population (1881) 7032, namely, 6197 Hindus, 831 Muhammadans, and 4 Christians. The fort was built in the 14th century by one of the refugees of the Morasu Wokkal tribe, who also founded Devanalli. In 1638 it was captured by a Bij\u00e1pur army under Ran-dull\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n; and after forty years\u2019 possession by that power, was surrendered to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. About 1700 it was re-taken by the Mughals, by whom it was entrusted to a succession of rulers as part of the Province of Sira, until annexed to Mysore by Haidar Ali in 1761. In the fort are the remains of several fine buildings and tanks. Cotton cloth of good quality and great variety is woven. A weekly fair, held on Thursdays, is attended by 3000 people. Head-quarters of a t\u00e1luk of the same name.\n\nDodderi.\u2014T\u00e1luk or Sub-division of Chitaldr\u00fag District, Mysore State. Area, 851 square miles.

Land revenue, \u00a310,939.\nDohad.\u2014Chief town of the Sub-division of Dohad in the District of the P\u00e1nch Mah\u00e1ls, Bombay Presidency. Latitude 22\u00b0 53' N., and longitude 74\u00b0 19' E.; 77 miles north-east of Baroda. Population (1881) 12,394, namely, 5,845 Hindus, 4,204 Muhammadans, 445 Jains, 5 P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 3 Christians, and 1,892 'others.' As the name Dohad (or 'two boundaries') implies, the town is situated on the line separating M\u00e1lw\u00e1 on the east from Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t) on the west. It is a place of considerable traffic, commanding one of the main lines of communication between Central India and the seaboard. A metalled and bridged road, 43 miles long, connects the town with the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway at Godhra. The strongly-built fort dates from the reign of the Gujar\u00e1t king, Ahmad I. (1412\u20131443). It was repaired by Muzaffar II. (1513\u20131526), also a Gujar\u00e1t monarch, and is said to have been again restored under the orders of the Emperor Aurangzeb (1658\u20131707). The town contains a sub-judge's and m\u00e1latd\u00e1r's court, post-office, civil hospital, and the District jail. In addition to the unarmed police, the Gujar\u00e1t Bh\u00edl corps, 530 strong, is quartered at Dohad. This regiment is not on the rolls of the army, but is commanded by the superintendent and assistant superintendent of police. About half the strength of the corps is employed on outpost duty.

The anicut extends to Pichika island. During its construction, which was commenced in 1847, Dowlaishvaram, as the head-quarters of the sappers and miners and a large engineering staff, was a place of much importance. At present it is the permanent station of the District engineering staff; the Government workshop established here turns out a large quantity of work for the Public Works Department. The houses of the former European residents, built on the hills in the neighbourhood, are now in ruins. Quarries of good building-stone are worked to the extent of 10,000 cubic yards annually, and the demand appears to be increasing year by year. During the wars between the S\u00edth\u00e1patis of R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri and the Muhammadan rulers of Ellore, in the 15th and 16th centuries, Dowlaishvaram was the usual crossing-point of the contending armies, and the scene, therefore, of frequent struggles. At present the town is connected with the coast at several points by numerous navigable canals of the God\u00e1vari irrigation system; and also with Madras through the Kistna system and the Buckingham Canal.\nDistance from Cocanada, by the shortest canal, 32 miles.\u2014See Godavari River.\n\nDowlatabad.\u2014Town in the Nizam\u2019s Dominions, Haidarabad.\u2014See Daulatabad.\n\nDoyang.\u2014River in Assam.\u2014See Dayang.\n\nDravida (Dravira).\u2014A division of the Indian Peninsula, ethnological and philological rather than geographical. It comprises India south of the Vindhy\u00e1 range and the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) river, excepting those parts of the eastern coast where Uriya is the vernacular, and the Districts of Western India and the Deccan, where Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed and Mar\u00e1th\u00ed are spoken. As early as 404 A.D., Dravida is spoken of (in the Brihat Samhita of Varaha Mihira) as being divided into Chola, Pandya, Ker\u00e1la, Karnataka, Kalinga, and Andhra. Manu mentions the inhabitants, \u2018the Dravidas,\u2019 as outcasts and barbarians, i.e. not in communion with Br\u00e1hmans, nor incorporated into the Hindu community. Modern authorities assign twelve dialects to the division, the four chief being T\u00e1mil, spoken in Pandya, Chola, and Eastern Ker\u00e1la, i.e. throughout the central and southern Districts of Madras; Telugu, the language of the Kalinga and Andhra countries, or \u2018Teling\u00e1na,\u2019 corresponding to the \u2018Northern Circars,\u2019 spoken by a population of 14\u00bd millions; Malay\u00e1lam, spoken in Western Ker\u00e1la, i.e. Malab\u00e1r, Travancore, and Cochin, the language of about 4 millions; and K\u00e1naresee, in \u2018Karnatika,\u2019 or K\u00e1nara, Mysore, and a few tracts of the Wynad and Coimbatore, comprising about 9 million inhabitants. Tulu is spoken round Mangalore by some 300,000 persons, and in Coorg by some 150,000. The other six \u2018uncultivated\u2019 dialects belong to some 2\u00bd millions of people, so that the entire division of \u2018Dravida\u2019 may be taken to include nearly 46 millions of inhabitants. The identification of the words Dravida and T\u00e1mil (or Tamul) has been ingeniously proposed by a modern scholar, as also the identity of both with the Dimyricce of the Peutingerian tables and the Limyricce of Ptolemy. The great authority on the languages of Southern India is Bishop Caldwell\u2019s Comparative Grammar. As Dravida is a linguistic and not an administrative division, the above inadequate notice must suffice here.\n\nDrug.\u2014Tahsil or revenue Sub-division in R\u00e1ipur District, Central Provinces.

With the rest of the t\u00e1luk, the town formed part of the Niz\u00e1m's territory until 1860, when it was incorporated with the Central Provinces. In 1874 it was transferred to Madras. The 'first barrier,' or rocky obstruction to irrigation, on the God\u00e1vari is at D\u00famag\u00fadiem.\u2014See Godavari River.\nDum-Dum.\u2014Sub-division of the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal; situated between $22^\\circ 34'$ and $22^\\circ 41'$ N. lat., and between $88^\\circ 26'$ and $88^\\circ 31'$ E. long. It consists of the single police circle (th\u00e1n\u00e1) of Dum-Dum. Area, 24 square miles; number of villages, 43; houses, 6241. Population (1881) 31,578, namely, males 17,008, and females 14,570; average density, 1316 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 1.79; persons per village, 734; houses per square mile, 282; persons per house, 5. Hindus numbered 17,868; Muhammadans, 12,640; Christians, 1045; Buddhists, 6; and 'others,' 19. The Sub-division contains 1 civil and 4 criminal courts. Strength of regular police, 72 men; village constables (chaukid\u00e1rs), 36. The Bengal Central Railway runs through the Sub-division.\n\nDum-Dum (Dam Dam\u00e1).\u2014Town, municipality, and cantonment in Dum-Dum Sub-division, Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s District, Bengal. Lat. $22^\\circ 37' 52''$ N., long. $88^\\circ 27' 51''$ E.; $4\\frac{1}{2}$ miles north-east of Calcutta. Population (1881) 4223, including the troops. The force stationed here in 1883 consisted of the Royal Welsh Fusilier Regiment. The barracks are built of brick and are very commodious, with a b\u00e1z\u00e1r some distance from the lines. Dum-Dum is a station on the Eastern Bengal Railway; contains an English school. In Major Smyth's Report, referring to a period anterior to 1857, it is stated that Dum-Dum was the head-quarters of the artillery from 1783 until their removal to Meerut, a more central station, in 1853. At that date the town possessed a magazine and percussion-cap manufactory; barracks; European and native hospital; a large b\u00e1z\u00e1r; several clear-water tanks; and a Protestant church, containing monuments erected to the memory of Colonel Pearse, the first commandant of the artillery regiment, and of Captain Nicholl and the officers and men of the 1st troop, 1st brigade, Horse Artillery, who perished during the retreat from K\u00e1b\u00fal in 1841. The treaty by which the Naw\u00e1b of Bengal ratified the privileges of the British, and restored the settlements at Calcutta, K\u00e1simb\u00e1z\u00e1r, and Dacca, was signed at Dum-Dum, February 6, 1757.\n\nDumk\u00e1.\u2014Sub-division and town in the District of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal.\u2014See Naya Dumka.\n\nDumr\u00e1 Falls.\u2014A succession of rapids in Hill Tipperah, Bengal; situated just below the point where the Ch\u00e1im\u00e1 and R\u00e1im\u00e1 unite to form the G\u00famt\u00ed. These rapids continue for a distance reckoned at a day's journey, and end in a picturesque cascade, which leaps into a pool whence the stream issues through a narrow gorge.\n\nDumr\u00e1on.\u2014Town and municipality in Shah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal. Lat. $25^\\circ 32' 59''$ N., long. $84^\\circ 11' 42''$ E. Station on the East Indian Railway. Population (1881) 17,429, namely, Hindus, 14,110; and Muhammadans, 3319; area of town site, 3393 acres. Municipal revenue (1881\u201382), \u00a3551, of which \u00a3477 was derived from taxation,\nor an average rate of taxation of 7\u00bdd. per head of the population; expenditure, \u00a3671.\n\n**Dumraon.**\u2014Branch of the Arrah Canal in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal; forming a portion of the Soane (S\u00f3n) system. It is 40\u00bd miles long, with 12 distributaries, and leaves the main canal at the 17th mile.\n\n**Dumurdah.**\u2014Town in H\u00fagl\u00ed District, Bengal; situated on the H\u00fagl\u00ed river just above Nay\u00e1 Sar\u00e1i, in lat. 23\u00b0 2' 15\" N., and long. 88\u00b0 28' 50\" E. Formerly notorious for its gangs of river d\u00e1k\u00e1its, and as the home of the ill-famed robber chief Biswan\u00e1th B\u00e1bu, who was at last betrayed by one of his comrades and hanged on the scene of his capture. Even as recently as 1845, it was said that 'people fear to pass by this place after sunset, and no boats are ever moored at its gh\u00e1t even in broad daylight.'\n\n**D\u00fan.**\u2014A range of hills in the north-west of Champ\u00e1ran District, Bengal; extending in a slightly south-easterly direction from the Rohu\u00e1 n\u00e1di to the Achu\u00ed n\u00e1di, a distance of about 20 miles, the average breadth being 4 miles. It has been suggested by some that this range is adapted for tea cultivation; others consider the climate too dry. The D\u00fan valley is inhabited by the aboriginal tribe of Th\u00e1rus.\n\n**Dunal Gh\u00e1t.**\u2014Pass over the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts, Nellore District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Dornal Ghat.\n\n**Dundw\u00e1raganj.**\u2014Small trading town in Etah District, North-Western Provinces, situated on the Sah\u00e1war and Pati\u00e1l\u00ed road, 22 miles north-east of Etah. Lat. 27\u00b0 43' 50\" N., long. 78\u00b0 59' 34\" E. Area, 65 acres. Population (1881) 5692, namely, 2788 Hindus and 2804 Muhammadans. Consists of two separate villages, Dundw\u00e1raganj and Dundw\u00e1ra Kh\u00e1s, separated from each other by a strip of open country, but sufficiently close to one another for inclusion under a common title. The town derives its name from a colony of Dundiya K\u00e1yasths, established on the spot by Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn Ghori in 1194 A.D., on the expulsion of a settlement of Kont R\u00e1jputs, who had previously owned the land. B\u00e1z\u00e1r, market-place, sar\u00e1i, school. The central roadway generally presents a busy scene, and the town, though small, contains many comparatively wealthy residents. Markets are held twice a week. For police and conservancy purposes, a small municipal income in the shape of a house-tax is (1882) levied under the provisions of the Chauk\u00edd\u00e1ri Act (xx. of 1856). Dundw\u00e1ra Kh\u00e1s is an agricultural village, containing many large mud-built houses and enclosures belonging to Musalm\u00e1n zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs. Both villages are narrow and of no great size, but are situated on a well-raised site, and the short road which joins them is wide and metalled. A good unmetalled road connects the two villages with Pati\u00e1l\u00ed and Sah\u00e1war.\n\n**Dungag\u00e1li (Dung\u00e1 G\u00e1li).**\u2014Small sanitarium in Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil, Haz\u00e1ra District, Punjab; composed of a few houses, or rather huts,\nscattered over the southern slopes of the Mochpura Hill, belonging to Europeans, who visit it from Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d and Murree during the summer. Staging bungalow and branch post-office.\n\n**D\u00fangarpur.**\u2014Native State in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, under the political superintendence of the Agent to the Governor-General for the States of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. It extends from latitude $23^\\circ 31'$ to $24^\\circ 3'$ N., and from longitude $73^\\circ 37'$ to $74^\\circ 16'$ E. Its length from east to west is 40 miles, and its breadth from north to south 35 miles; total area, according to the Census of 1881, 1000 square miles. Bounded on the north by Udaipur (Oodeypore) State; on the east by Udaipur and the river M\u00e1hi, which separates it from the State of B\u00e1nsw\u00e1ra; on the south and west by the Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha and Mahi K\u00e1ntha Agencies in Gujar\u00e1t. The country consists for the most part of stony hills covered with low jungle of cactus, jujube trees, and a gum-producing tree called salar by the natives, together with several other varieties of shrubs and trees requiring neither a deep soil nor moisture. In the north and east of the State the landscape is wild and rugged, but towards the southwest border the harsher features are much softened, and for several miles the country resembles Gujar\u00e1t in character and appearance. There are two or three large forest tracts, producing blackwood, ebony, and other valuable timber-trees. Of pasture-land, properly so called, there is scarcely any; and during the hot season the numerous cattle kept by the Bh\u00edls are reduced to a miserable state of leanness. The cultivated area is almost entirely confined to the valleys and low ground between the hills, where the soil is of a rich alluvial nature, and can be irrigated from numerous wells and tanks. On the hill-sides, the only cultivation attempted is by burning down occasional patches of forest, and scattering seed in the ashes. Though the country is broken and hilly, none of the hills attain a great height. The geological structure of D\u00fangarpur is of trap; the rocks belong to the granitic, primitive, or metamorphic order of formation, their chief constituents being gneiss, hornblende, argillaceous schist or clay slate, mica, calcareous sandstone, quartz, etc. A good durable stone of the granitic class, fit for building purposes, is quarried from a hill about 6 miles south of the capital. A soft greenish greystone (serpentine) is found near the village of Matugamra, about 6 miles east of the capital. This is carved extensively at D\u00fangarpur town and elsewhere, into idols, drinking cups, and effigies of men and animals. Another species of hard stone (basaltic), of which grindstones and similar articles are manufactured, is mined near the town of Sagw\u00e1ra. Lime is found in tolerable abundance, but not of very pure quality. No attempt appears ever to have been made to work an iron mine in the State, although the presence of this ore in the form of iron pyrites is manifest.\n\nThe only rivers are the Mahi and Som, which meet near the sacred\ntemple of Baneswar, where a large fair is held every year. The Mahi divides the State from B\u00e1nsw\u00e1ra, and the Som from the estate of Salumbar in Udaipur (Oodeypore). Both these streams are perennial, although in several places the water of the Som runs in a subterranean channel, suddenly disappearing and emerging again, apparently but little affected by its temporary subsidence. The bed of the Mahi is on an average about 300 or 400 feet in breadth, and is, on the whole, stony. Its banks are in many parts steep, but never very high, and are thickly lined in many places with Vitex trifolia (chaste tree), called by the natives bena, which affords cover in the hot weather to tigers and other wild beasts. There are no natural lakes in the State, but there are some five or six large pieces of water artificially enclosed. The climate is temperate and dry. The mean temperature is about 75\u00b0 F., with an annual range of about 25\u00b0, and the average rainfall is 24 inches. With the exception of ague and fever of a mild type at the end of the rains, the country is considered to be on the whole healthy, cholera and other epidemics being almost unknown; guinea-worm is a common complaint.\n\nThe natural productions of the State are \u2014 wheat, barley, gram, millet, Indian corn, rice, and a few inferior sorts of grain; also cotton, opium, oil-seeds, ginger, chillies, turmeric, and sugar-cane. Vegetables (onions, yams, sweet potatoes, egg plants, and radishes) are grown in considerable quantities. Fruit is not abundant, little else being seen but melons, limes, mangoes, and plantains. Mahu\u00e1 trees are very numerous, and from their flower a strong fermented liquor is distilled.\n\nThe total population returned by the Census of 1881 was 153,381, of whom 66,952 were Bhils, the whole being distributed in 421 villages and towns, and occupying 36,226 houses, of which 16,759 were those of the Bhils. Classified according to religion, the Hindus numbered 75,260; the Muhammadans, 3609; and Jains, 7560. Excluding the Bhils, whose enumeration as to sex was not determined, the males numbered 44,568; females, 41,861; average of the total population, 153 persons per square mile. There are said to be sixteen first-class nobles or Th\u00e1kurs and thirty-two of inferior rank, who compose the aristocracy of the State. All these are R\u00e1jputs, who hold their land nominally by grant from the ruling chief, but really by right of kinship or alliance with his family; their united estates comprise lands in which are situated 170 villages. The State is divided into 6 pargan\u00e1s or tapp\u00e1s, namely, B\u00e1r\u00e1, Barel, Kit\u00e1r\u00e1, Chaur\u00e1si, Tirpod, and Ch\u00fasat, in each of which are several villages, which are classed as follows:\u2014(1) Kh\u00e1l\u015ba, or crown lands; (2) J\u00e1girs, or those held by the nobles; and (3) Khair\u00e1t, or religious grants. The greater portion of the land is irrigated by wells. The principal traders are the Mah\u00e1jans among the Hindus, and the Bohras (Borahs) among\nthe Muhammadans. A number of Path\u00e1ns and Mekr\u00e1n\u00eds reside in D\u00fangarpur territory, most of whom are employed as soldiers or armed retainers. The language spoken is a mixture of Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed and Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed, locally called B\u00e1gar.\n\nSome years ago, carefully-prepared statistics showed that the total land revenue of D\u00fangarpur amounted to about \u00a318,335, of which \u00a37968 went to the State, \u00a39196 to the Th\u00e1kurs, and the balance to the religious orders. In 1882\u201383, the revenue of the State was reported to the Meyw\u00e1r officials as being \u00a320,931. The State pays tribute to the British Government of about \u00a3350. No schools have been established in D\u00fangarpur, nor is there any system of education. All civil and criminal cases of any importance are settled by a court of officials called k\u00e1md\u00e1rs, presided over by the diw\u00e1n or minister, from which, however, an appeal lies to the Mahar\u00e1wal. There are six police centres in the Districts, at each of which is stationed an official called a th\u00e1n\u00e1d\u00e1r. The th\u00e1n\u00e1d\u00e1rs are of two classes; the first can sentence offenders to one month\u2019s imprisonment, or impose a fine of 5os. The second can impose a fine of \u00a31, or eight days\u2019 imprisonment. The police arrangements of the capital are conducted by a kotw\u00e1l or superintendent and 25 constables. There is a jail at the capital.\n\nThere are no made roads in the State. The principal towns are the capital Dungarpur, Galli\u00e1kot, and Sagw\u00e1ra. Two fairs are held during the year, one at Baneswar in February or March, the other at Galli\u00e1kot about the end of the latter month, each lasting about fifteen days. Baneswar is also a place of Hindu pilgrimage.\n\nMahar\u00e1wal Udai Singh is the present chief of D\u00fangarpur. He belongs to the Sesodi\u00e1 clan of R\u00e1jputs, and claims descent from an elder branch of the family which now rules at Udaipur. The early history of the family is not known with certainty; but when the Mughal Empire had been fairly consolidated, the D\u00fangarpur chief appears to have opened communication with the Mughal court. His successors paid tribute and did military service. Upon the fall of the Empire, D\u00fangarpur became tributary to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, from whose yoke the prince and his people were rescued by the British, and a treaty was concluded in 1818. As in other States inhabited by wild hill-tribes, it became necessary at an early period of the British supremacy to employ a military force to coerce the Bhils, who had been excited to rebellion by some of the disaffected nobles. The Bhil chiefs, however, submitted to terms before any actual hostilities commenced. The Mahar\u00e1wal Jaswant Singh was found incompetent as a ruler, and deposed by the British Government in 1825. His adopted son, Dalpat Singh, second son of the chief of Part\u00e1bgarh, was made regent, and succeeded him. But on his accession to the State of Part\u00e1bgarh, he was permitted to adopt the present ruler, Udai Singh, then a minor, as his successor in D\u00fangarpur.\nThe military force consists of 4 guns, about 400 cavalry, and 1000 infantry. The chief is entitled to a salute of 15 guns, and holds a sanad from the British Government authorizing adoption.\n\n**D\u00fangarpur.** \u2014 Town and residence of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1wal of the D\u00fangarpur State in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; lies in latitude $23^\\circ 52'$ N., longitude $73^\\circ 49'$ E., on the route from Nimach (Neemuch) to D\u00eds\u00e1 (Deesa), 139 miles south-west of the former and 121 miles south-east of the latter. The town is overlooked by a hill about 700 feet high, and 5 miles in circumference at base, which, with the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1wal\u2019s palace on its side, and a lake at its foot, forms a striking picture.\n\n**D\u00fani.** \u2014 Town in Jaipur (Jeypore) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Latitude $25^\\circ 52'$ N., longitude $75^\\circ 38'$ E.; 70 miles south of Jaipur. Population (1881) 3383. Contains a fort, and is surrounded by a mud wall.\n\n**Duns, The.** \u2014 See Dehra Dun.\n\n**D\u00fantham\u00ed.** \u2014 River in the Tenasserim Division, British Burma, which has never been thoroughly explored. It rises somewhat below the latitude of Shwe-gyin, between the Bilin (Bhileng) and Salwin rivers, and, after a tortuous course southwards, unites with the Kyauk-sarit in about lat. $16^\\circ 59' 30''$ N., to form the Binlaing (Bhenglaing), a tributary of the Salwin. Navigable by native boats. In the upper part of its course it flows through a hilly teak-covered country, and its tributary streams facilitate the transport of the timber in the rains.\n\n**D\u00fanwon.** \u2014 Village in Tha-t\u00fan township, Amherst District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma; situated on the left bank of the Bilin (Bhileng) river now embanked. Population (1881) 285. In former times D\u00fanwon was an important walled city, and the capital of the surrounding country. In 1306 and 1351, when it formed a portion of Martaban, it was captured by the King of Chiengmai, east of the Salwin; later on, it was taken by Radzadirit.\n\n**D\u00fanyian.** \u2014 Tidal creek in Thungwa District, Irawadi Division, British Burma. Its total length is 13 miles, and it runs from the To or China Bakir in a southerly direction to the sea. The depth of water varies from $\\frac{1}{2}$ fathom to 8 or 9 fathoms, the northern end being shallow, and the southern deep; the water is sweet, except at spring tides, when a high bore is formed. On account of numerous shoals, the river is only navigable by small boats. On its right bank, in the interior, stretch extensive plains abounding in game; and on the left, wild elephants are found.\n\n**D\u00fany\u00edn.** \u2014 A peak in the Zweh-ka-bin Hills, north of Maulmain, Amherst District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. It is difficult of ascent, owing to the precipitous nature of the limestone rocks. At the summit is a large basin, which appears to be the crater of an extinct volcano; this is surrounded for miles by dark precipitous crags of every form. Down a steep descent of one or two hundred feet,\nan uneven plain covered with a luxuriant forest is seen. This impregnable natural fortress was the refuge of the Karengs for many generations. Its great drawback is the deficient water-supply. It is said that a large number of Karengs, besieged here by the Siamese, perished for want of food and water. D\u00fanyin means 'City of weeping,' and derives its name from this tradition.\n\n**Durduri\u00e1.**\u2014Site of a ruined fort in Dacca District, Bengal, said to have been built by the Bhuiy\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1s; its popular name is R\u00e1nib\u00e1ri. Dr. Taylor states that the fort is laid out in the shape of a crescent, bounded by the river Banar. In 1839, the outer wall, upwards of 2 miles in circuit, was 12 or 14 feet high. The citadel, which appears to have had three openings, contains the remains of two buildings, one of which seems to have been a tower. Opposite to Durduri\u00e1 are the foundations of a town, of which the only vestiges existing in 1839 were mounds and loose bricks scattered over the surface of the plain.\n\n**Durg\u00e1rayapatnam** (*Yuv\u00e1rayapatam*, 'City of the Minister,' Telugu).\u2014Town in the G\u00fad\u00far taluk, Nellore District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 13\u00b0 59' N., long. 80\u00b0 12' E. Population (1881) 2123, namely, 1829 Hindus and 294 Muhammadans. Number of houses, 400. Formerly the chief of the group of small ports\u2014P\u00fadi, Pamanji, T\u00fapili\u2014lying near the Armeghon lighthouse, but now of as little commercial importance as the others, the East Coast Canal having diverted the coasting traffic upon which they depended. Still possesses a customs station and a fine travellers' bungalow. The salt manufacture at this place is of some repute. Historically, Durg\u00e1rayapatnam, or Armeghon as it is sometimes called, is of interest as being the first British settlement on the Coromandel coast. In 1625, after unsuccessful attempts to settle at Pulicat and Masulipatam, a colony was established here; and in 1628 a factory was built at Chenna Kuppam (re-named 'Arumugam,' in recognition of the friendly aid given by Arumugam Mudelliar, the chief man of the native town), and fortified with 12 guns. The remnants of the Masulipatam settlement were then transferred here. But owing to the interference of the Dutch at Pulicat, and the hostility of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Venkatagiri, the trade languished; and on the chief factor's recommendation to move the settlement to some spot south of Pulicat, the site of Madras city was purchased.\n\n**Durrung.**\u2014District of Assam.\u2014See DARRANG.\n\n**Duttal\u00far.**\u2014Village in Udayagiri taluk, Nellore District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 2926; number of houses, 552.\n\n**Duttia.**\u2014State in Bundelkhand, Central India Agency.\u2014See DATIA.\n\n**D\u00faya.**\u2014An extensive group of intercommunicating lakes in Henzada township, Henzada District, Irawadi (Irrawaddy) Division, British Burma. The D\u00faya proper is 2 square miles in extent, and, until the embankments were made, was connected with the Irawadi by the Atha-\ny\u00fat stream. It is divided into two portions by an island. The Mos\u00fan portion is $2\\frac{1}{2}$ miles in length, and from 300 to 400 yards in breadth, with a depth of from 6 to 9 feet of water in the dry season. The other chief lakes are the Intha-ny\u00fat, length 1400 feet, maximum breadth 700 feet, and depth of water 4 to 6 feet; and the Mobaleh, with about 5 feet of water in the dry weather. These lakes are fed by the drainage of the surrounding country, but the Irawadi embankments have now closed the mouths of the streams by which they communicated with that river during the rains.\n\n**Dw\u00e1rband.**\u2014Pass in the Til\u00e1in range of hills, in Cachar District, Assam, through which the road has been led joining H\u00e1il\u00e1k\u00e1ndi with the station of Silch\u00e1r.\n\n**Dwarikeswar.**\u2014River of Bengal.\u2014See Dhalkisor.\n\n**Dw\u00e1rk\u00e1.**\u2014Seaport and place of Hindu pilgrimage, situated in the peninsula of K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, Bombay Presidency, within the dominions of the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda. Latitude $22^\\circ 14' 20''$ N., and longitude $69^\\circ 5'$ E.; 235 miles south-west of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, and 270 west of Baroda. Population (1870) 4712; in 1881, under 5000; number of houses, 743. Dw\u00e1rk\u00e1 is the principal town in the V\u00e1gher District of Okhamandal, and besides a company of Bombay Native Infantry, contains the head-quarters of the Okh\u00e1mandal Battalion, which has a non-commissioned officer and three privates stationed at every V\u00e1gher village. The temple of Dw\u00e1rk\u00e1n\u00e1th is resorted to by about 10,000 pilgrims annually. The devout Hindu believes it to have been raised in one night by supernatural agency. It consists of a shrine, a spacious hall of audience, the roof of which is supported by 60 granite and sandstone pillars and a conical spire 170 feet in height. The body of the temple has five stories, its height being 100 feet. Annual revenue derived from the temple, \u00a3200. Vessels occasionally lie off the roadstead at Dw\u00e1rk\u00e1, but the anchorage is insecure during stormy weather. Five schools; military and civil hospitals. Dw\u00e1rk\u00e1 has, since the rebellion of the V\u00e1gher tribes in 1859, been the head-quarters of an officer deputed by the Bombay Political Department.\n\n**Dwark\u00e1** (or Babla).\u2014An unnavigable river of Bengal, rising in the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s District; in lat. $23^\\circ 57'$ N., and long. $87^\\circ 21'$ E. Thence it enters B\u00edrbh\u00fam from the north, and from B\u00edrbh\u00fam passes into Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d near Margr\u00e1m town. At first the course of the Dwark\u00e1 is easterly, until joined by the Br\u00e1hman\u00ed stream at R\u00e1mchandrapur. It then turns towards the south-east, and receives the Mor and Kuiy\u00e1, two rivers also flowing down from B\u00edrbh\u00fam towards the Bh\u00e1girathi. At this point the numerous back-waters commence which connect the Dwark\u00e1 with the Bh\u00e1girathi, a branch of the Ganges or Padm\u00e1.\n\n**Dwarkeswar.**\u2014River of Bengal.\u2014See Dhalkisor.\nDw\u00e1r-khaling.\u2014Forest reserve in Darrang District, Assam.\u2014See Khaling-Dwar.\n\nDw\u00e1rs, Eastern.\u2014The tract called the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs forms an integral portion of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, under the Chief Commissioner of Assam. It lies between $26^\\circ 19'$ and $26^\\circ 54'$ N. lat., and between $89^\\circ 55'$ and $91^\\circ$ E. long. It is bounded on the north by the hills of Bh\u00fat\u00e1n; on the east by the Man\u00e1s river, separating it from the District of K\u00e1mr\u00fap; on the south by the main portion of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District; and on the west by the Gang\u00e1dhar or Sankos river, which separates it from the Western Dw\u00e1rs, attached to Jalp\u00e1gur\u00ed District, in Bengal, and the State of Kuch Behar. According to the Revenue Survey conducted in 1874\u201375, the area amounts to 1569.92 square miles, and the Census of 1881 returned the population at 56,136 persons. The principal town, or rather village, is Bijni; but the tract is administered from Dh\u00fabri town, which is also the head-quarters of the entire District of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The Eastern Dw\u00e1rs form a flat strip of country, lying beneath the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n mountains. The only elevated tract is Bhumeswar hill, which rises abruptly out of the plains to the height of nearly 400 feet, and may be regarded as a detached spur of the G\u00e1ro Hills on the south of the Brahmaputra. The remainder is an absolute level, intersected by numerous streams, and overgrown with wild vegetation. In some parts there are extensive tracts of s\u00e1l forest; but the greater portion is covered with heavy grass and reed jungle, amid which the beautiful cotton-tree (Bombax pentandrum) is the only timber to be seen. This grass jungle is especially thick along the banks of the rivers, where it is almost impenetrable to man. The few villages are marked by clearings of rice and mustard cultivation. The houses themselves are embowered in clumps of bamboos and plantains, above which tower the graceful betel-nut palm, and various fruit-trees. At the foot of the mountains, where the rivers debouch upon the plain, the scenery assumes a grander aspect.\n\nThe following eleven rivers are navigable by native boats throughout the year:\u2014Man\u00e1s, Dal\u00e1n\u00ed, P\u00e1k\u00e1j\u00e1n\u00ed, \u00c1\u00ed, K\u00e1n\u00e1m\u00e1kr\u00e1, Champ\u00e1m\u00e1ti, Gaur\u00e1ng, Saralbh\u00e1ng\u00e1, Gangi\u00e1, Gurup\u00e1l\u00e1, and Gang\u00e1dhar. In addition, there are numerous small streams which become navigable during the rainy season. By far the most important channel of communication is afforded by the Man\u00e1s, which might be navigated by steamers of light draught. All the rivers take their rise in the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n Hills, and flow in a southerly direction into the Brahmaputra. Their beds are filled with boulders in the hills, but they become sandy as they advance into the plain. There is a peculiar tract of pebbles, gravel, and sand fringing the hills, into which the water of all the minor streams sinks during the greater part of the year, not again appearing above ground until it reaches the alluvial clay.\nThe valuable forests of the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs have within the last few years been placed under Government supervision; and in 1881 an area of 447 square miles, or just one-quarter of the aggregate area of the entire tract, had been 'reserved,' and placed under the management of the Forest Department. About 80 square miles are s\u00e1l timber, which is described as the most valuable property in the whole Province of Assam, and should yield an annual produce of 25,000 trees. At present, however, owing to the indiscriminate havoc wrought in former years by the Bengali woodcutters, there are no mature trees left standing. Besides s\u00e1l (Shorea robusta) the following timber-trees are carefully preserved in an 'open forest':\u2014Sissu (Dalbergia sissoo), khair (Acacia catechu), and chelauni (Schima vel Gordonia mollis); all other timber is free. The great danger to which the forests are exposed is the spread of j\u00fam cultivation, by which fresh tracts of jungle are fired every year. Stringent regulations are now enforced against this practice within Government reserves. The jungle products include lac, beeswax, pipali or long pepper (Chavica roxburghii), and a creeper from which a red dye called dsu is obtained. No metals or mineral products are known to exist. Wild animals of all kinds abound, including elephant, rhinoceros, buffalo, tiger, bear, hog, and deer.\n\nHistory.\u2014This tract first became British territory as the result of the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n war of 1864\u201365, and does not possess any independent history of its own. It is known, however, that the despotic rule of the Bhuti\u00e1s was only of recent date. The earliest dynasty that can be localized in this tract is that of Visu Singh, the ancestor of the Kuch Behar R\u00e1j\u00e1s, who founded an empire in the 16th century on the ruins of an earlier kingdom, extending from Darrang in the upper valley of the Brahmaputra to the frontier of Purniah in Bengal. But this wide empire rapidly fell to pieces, owing partly to the anarchical system, by which large tracts were granted out as appanages to younger sons of the royal family. In this way the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Bijni and Sidli Dw\u00e1rs, as well as the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Darrang, acquired their present estates. While the State thus became enfeebled, invaders were pressing forward from every quarter. On the west, the Mughals rapidly advanced, and annexed the permanently-settled portion of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra to their Province of Bengal. The wild tribe of Ahams spread down the Brahmaputra valley, and maintained themselves at the ancient capital of Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed against the Musalm\u00e1n armies. At about the same time, the Dw\u00e1rs or lowland passes along the foot of the mountains fell to the Bhuti\u00e1s, who here found the cultivable ground that their own bare mountains did not afford. They exercised predominant influence over the whole tract from the frontier of Sikkim as far east as Darrang, and frequently enforced claims of suzerainty over the enfeebled State of Kuch Behar. They do not appear to have occupied this tract permanently, but merely to have\nexacted a heavy tribute, and subjected the miserable inhabitants to the cruellest treatment. In contradistinction to the results of Muhammadan rule, it is to be observed that the Buddhism of the Bhuti\u00e1s has left no traces in the religion of the native population. Kuch Behar was delivered from the Bhuti\u00e1 tyranny by the treaty of 1772, in accordance with which the R\u00e1j\u00e1 placed himself under British protection, and paid tribute to the East India Company. The Bhut\u00e1n Dw\u00e1rs, as they were called, remained for nearly a century longer in a state of anarchy. In 1863, a British ambassador was subjected to gross insults by the Bhut\u00e1n Government; and, as a punishment, it was resolved to annex the Dw\u00e1rs to British territory. Accordingly, in December 1864, four strong military columns made a simultaneous advance, and occupied the low country and the hill passes above, after slight opposition. At the fort of Diwangiri (q.v.) a reverse to the British arms was experienced; but before the close of 1865, the Bhuti\u00e1s consented to accept the terms of peace which had been offered to them before the outbreak of hostilities. By this treaty, the Dw\u00e1rs were ceded in perpetuity to the British Government, and an annual allowance of \u00a32500 was granted to the Bhut\u00e1n R\u00e1j\u00e1, which sum may be increased to \u00a35000, or withdrawn altogether, at the option of the British. Since that date our relations with Bhut\u00e1n have been entirely peaceful. The frontier raids, which were formerly of frequent occurrence, have altogether ceased. A brisk traffic has sprung up on the frontier, and cultivation is rapidly extending in the annexed territory.\n\nThe Bhut\u00e1n Dw\u00e1rs were forthwith divided into the two administrative Districts of the Eastern and Western Dw\u00e1rs, of which the latter has since been apportioned between the Bengal Districts of Jalp\u00e1igur\u00ed and D\u00e1rj\u00edling. The Eastern Dw\u00e1rs were at first placed in charge of a Deputy Commissioner, with his head-quarters at the village of Datm\u00e1, in the Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 pargan\u00e1 of Khunt\u00e1gh\u00e1t. In December 1866 they were completely incorporated with the District of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1, and have since shared in all the changes of jurisdiction by which that District has been transferred between Bengal and Assam. Since 1874, when Assam was erected into an independent Province under a Chief Commissioner, the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs have been permanently detached from Bengal. But though the settled portion of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 and the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs are under the control of a single officer, the system of administration is quite distinct. By Act xvi. of 1869, all matters relating to immovable property, revenue, and rent, are exempted from the jurisdiction of the civil courts. The property in the soil is vested in the State. By the settlement which expired in March 1877, leases were granted for seven years. In some of the Dw\u00e1rs these leases were granted direct to the cultivators, without the interposition of any middle-men; but in other\ncases the R\u00e1j\u00e1s received farming leases of the whole area over which they claimed to exercise authority. The latter system has not been found advantageous; and in regard to the Dw\u00e1rs of Ripu, Guma, and Chirang, the management has, since the expiry of the previous settlement, been carried on under the regular Assam Settlement system, by annual patt\u00e1s or leases granted direct to the cultivators through representatives of villages (mauz\u00e1d\u00e1rs). In Sidli and Bijn\u00ed Dw\u00e1rs it has recently been decided to recognise the R\u00e1j\u00e1s who derive their titles from those estates, as zamind\u00e1rs or proprietors at a permanently-fixed Government rental, for the greater part of the area, and to conclude a settlement direct with them for the remainder, protecting the cultivators by a sub-settlement.\n\nPopulation.\u2014At the time of the settlement of 1869-70, the Deputy Commissioner personally conducted an enumeration of the people, which showed a total population of 37,047 persons, dwelling in 2863 enclosures or villages and in 6888 houses, on an area of 1569 square miles. In 1881, the total population was returned at 56,136, but no details are available. The great bulk of the inhabitants belong to the two aboriginal tribes of Mech or Cachari and Koch or R\u00e1jbansi. The number of Hindus proper is very small, and the Muhammadans only number 110, who are supposed to represent proselytes made at the time of the Mughal conquest of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1. The Mechs are returned by the Deputy Commissioner as numbering in 1870, 8752 adult males, or 70 per cent. of the total. This tribe is generally regarded as cognate to the Koch, Cachari, and R\u00e1bh\u00e1, all of whom inhabit this part of the country. The names of Mech and Cachari are indifferently applied to the same people, the latter name being especially used in the extreme east of the District. The tribe is widely scattered over all North-Eastern Bengal, being able to support life in the malarious tar\u00e1i that continuously fringes the first slopes of the Him\u00e1layas. In the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs, and especially in Sidl\u00ed Dw\u00e1r, where, under the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n Government, they remained comparatively free from Hindu influences, they have preserved their own language and customs in greater purity than elsewhere. They describe themselves as having originally come from a place they called Rangsar, on the south side of the upper valley of the Brahmaputra, whence they were gradually pushed westwards into Assam. Owing to the anarchy that prevailed in Assam towards the close of the last century, a considerable portion of the population of K\u00e1mrup crowded into the frontier District of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1. The upper classes returned to Assam upon our annexation of the Province in 1824-25; but the poorer wanderers settled permanently in the pargan\u00e1s of Khunt\u00e1gh\u00e1t and H\u00e1br\u00e1gh\u00e1t, whence they have recently moved into Eastern Dw\u00e1rs. At the present time they are rapidly falling under the influence of Hinduism, and converts find no difficulty in being received\namong the R\u00e1jbansi and other mongrel castes. Their indigenous religion consists in the propitiation of evil spirits by the sacrifice of fowls. Converts to Hinduism are known as Soroni\u00e1s, but the change does not seem to be very extensive; they are only required to bathe, to call on the name of some guru or spiritual instructor, and to abstain from beef, pork, and liquor. Their social condition is very low. They do not appear to have ever achieved any form of polity of their own. They have but few traditions, no ancient songs, no monuments, no written character, and no literature of any kind. Their marriage ceremony preserves the primitive form of abduction. They still retain migratory habits, which are illustrated by the nomadic form of agriculture known as jum. On the other hand, they are not destitute of the virtues of savages. They are more uniformly honest and trustworthy than the lowland peasantry; chastity is esteemed a virtue, and crime of any sort is rare. Above all, the Mechs are possessed of a physical constitution that enables them to live and flourish all the year through in a malarious tract which is absolutely fatal to strangers; and their rude methods of agriculture are gradually rendering the country habitable for successors of a superior race. The R\u00e1jbansi\u00eds numbered in 1870, 2400 adult males, or 20 per cent. of the total. This tribe is identical with the Koch of Assam and of Kuch Behar. They are said to have originally inhabited the lower ranges of hills to the north, and to have first descended into the plains in about the 16th century. The high-sounding name of R\u00e1jbansi, meaning \u2018of the royal kindred,\u2019 is adopted by those Kochs who have embraced Hinduism, as well as by converts from other aboriginal tribes. According to Mr. Brian H. Hodgson, Koch is beyond doubt simply the name of Hinduized Mechs or Cacharis. Their original seat in Assam was probably in the Northern Cachar Hills and in Nowgong and Darrang Districts. The most numerous of the pure S\u00fadra castes is the Kolit\u00e1, who acted as priests to the native kings of Assam, and are now engaged as peons, clerks, and cultivators. The Bair\u00e1g\u00eds are the religious mendicants of the Vishnuvite sect; and the Gosw\u00e1m\u00eds or Gos\u00e1ins are their spiritual preceptors. The Br\u00e1hma Sam\u00e1j has no followers in the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs.\n\nThe population is absolutely rural, every person being directly engaged in agriculture. The only village that possesses a permanent b\u00e1z\u00e1r is Bijni, and even small shops are rarely to be seen. There is abundance of spare land that can easily be brought under cultivation, and the sparsely-scattered inhabitants are described as being all prosperous and contented. Immigration is steadily going on from the neighbouring pargan\u00e1s of K\u00e1mr\u00fap and Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1, and the new-comers at once amalgamate with the rest of the people, as they are usually of the same race. An interesting experiment in colonization was begun in 1880 by the introduction of some Sant\u00e1l families, all professing\nChristianity. These settlers now (1882) number about 75 households, and more are expected to follow.\n\nAgriculture, etc.\u2014The staple crop throughout the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs is rice, which is cultivated in three principal varieties. The \u00e1us or \u00e1su crop is sown on comparatively high lands in March; it is not transplanted, and is reaped in July. The b\u00e1o or b\u00e1v\u00e1, which is a long-stemmed variety, is not much grown. The \u00e1man, haimantik, or s\u00e1li furnishes the greater portion of the food-supply; it is sown broadcast in nurseries in June, transplanted in the following month, and reaped in December. Mustard seed is extensively grown as a second crop after \u00e1us rice. Minor crops include vegetables, barley, pulse, tobacco, p\u00e1n or betel-leaf, and betel-nut (Areca catechu). According to the Survey of 1869\u201370, out of a total area of more than one million acres, only 51,224, or about one-twentieth, were then under cultivation,\u2014thus sub-divided: s\u00e1li rice, 32,296; \u00e1us rice and mustard, 15,498; homestead lands, 2493. The cultivated area in 1882 had increased to 66,572 acres. The Mechs follow the j\u00fam method of cultivation, and raise a good deal of cotton on their forest clearings in addition to the ordinary crops. Manure is only used for the p\u00e1n plant, and then in the form of refuse from the cow-sheds. Irrigation is universally practised in the case of the s\u00e1li rice crop. The cultivators combine to cut channels from the hill streams, by which they distribute the water over their fields. Waste land is abundant on all sides, and consequently the same fields are never cultivated after they begin to lose their natural productiveness. Aus land is generally abandoned after two years; but s\u00e1li land continues to yield annual crops for a longer period. The entire soil is the property of Government, and, by the settlement of 1869\u201370, was leased out for a term of seven years, on conditions favourable to the spread of cultivation. The rates of rents then fixed, which still continue in force under the present system of annual settlements, were the following:\u2014For homestead and s\u00e1li lands, 3s. per acre; for \u00e1us lands, 1s. 6d. per acre. The average out-turn from an acre of s\u00e1li land is estimated at about 23 cwts. of paddy or unhusked rice, valued at \u00a32, 15s.; an acre of \u00e1us land yields about 15 cwts. of paddy, and an additional 5 cwts. of mustard seed, the whole being valued at \u00a32, 5s. Women and children are largely employed in the fields.\n\nNo professional class of day-labourers exists in the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs; but coolies may sometimes be obtained for 4d. a day. Agricultural labourers are generally remunerated by being allowed to retain a fixed share of the produce, without having any interest in the soil. Artisans also, such as smiths or carpenters, are paid in kind for any odd job they may do. The price of rice varies regularly with the season of the year. Best rice shortly after harvest sells at about 5s. 5d. per cwt., which gradually rises through the year till it reaches 8s. 2d., just before the\n\u00e1man crop is gathered. Similarly the price of common rice varies from 2s. 8d. to 5s. 5d. per cwt. Unhusked paddy fetches from one-third to one-half the price of cleaned rice. The prices of food-grains were not affected by the famines of 1866 and 1874.\n\nSince the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs came under British rule in 1864, such a calamity as the general destruction of the harvest by either flood, drought, or blight, has been unknown and unthought of. The rice crops have been occasionally injured by river floods and excessive local rainfall. The irrigation universally practised by the cultivators furnishes an efficient guarantee against the effects of drought. If an unprecedented misfortune were to happen, and the price of rice were to rise to 10s. per cwt. at the beginning of the year, that should be regarded as a sign of approaching famine. The inhabitants, however, know how to support life on various jungle products, and the numerous rivers afford ample means of communication. The only road in the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs is one that crosses the whole tract from east to west, running a length of 73 miles. It is interrupted by unbridged rivers and swampy tracts, and becomes altogether impassable during the rainy season. Wheeled carts are nowhere used.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014There is no manufacturing class in the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs. In addition to their livelihood of agriculture, the people make for themselves their own houses, their own clothes, baskets, and mats. Brass utensils and pottery require to be purchased from Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1. The only article manufactured for sale is a coarse silk fabric called eri\u00e1, which is woven from the cocoons of a worm fed on the castor-oil plant (Ricinus communis). A piece, 14 feet long by 4 feet broad, sells for from 12s. to \u00a31, according to the fineness of its texture. The Mechs also hollow out the trunks of trees into boats, called d\u00fang\u00e1s, which are floated down the streams in the rainy season for sale on the Brahmaputra. This industry is mainly supported by advances from the Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 merchants.\n\nThe trade of the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs is mainly conducted by barter, and is in the hands of M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri merchants from Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 and K\u00e1mrup. Boats come up the rivers during the rainy season, and transact their business at the villages on the river banks. There are no large permanent markets. The principal articles of export are rice, mustard seed, eri\u00e1 cloth, cotton, india-rubber, a dye called \u00e1su, timber, and boats; in exchange for which are received brass-ware, pottery, salt, cotton cloth, oil, spices, cocoa-nuts, and miscellaneous hardware. In ordinary seasons, the crops provide a considerable surplus for exportation.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The Eastern Dw\u00e1rs consist of the following 5 Dw\u00e1rs:\n\n\u2014BIJNI\u2014area 374 square miles, population (1881) 24,882; SIDLI\u2014area 361 square miles, population 23,657; CHIRANG\u2014area 495 square\nmiles, population 1216; Ripu\u2014area 242 square miles, population 3040; Guma\u2014area 98 square miles, population 3341. The administrative statistics cannot be separated from those of the District of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1, and are given in the aggregate in the special article on that District. It is there stated that the total land revenue from temporarily-settled estates, which may be assumed to be co-extensive with the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs, amounted in 1874\u201375 to \u00a35158, collected from 27 estates. The tract is entirely administered from Dhubr\u00ed town, and no European officer is permanently stationed in it.\n\nA settlement of the land revenue was made for seven years in 1870. Chirang Dw\u00e1r was held kh\u00e1s, or, in other words, engagements were taken from the occupants actually in possession; for the four other Dw\u00e1rs collective leases were granted to neighbouring landlords or chiefs. Provision was made for the protection of occupancy rights, and permission to extend cultivation was conceded to the leaseholders, who receive the profits arising from such extension during the currency of their term. As already mentioned, the Assam system of settlement has now been substituted for the leases granted in 1870, in all but two of the Dw\u00e1rs, which have been settled with the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Sidl\u00ed and Bijn\u00ed, who have been held to be entitled to the position of zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs. The Eastern Dwars are included within the head-quarters Sub-division of Dhubr\u00ed.\n\nDwars, Western.\u2014A tract lying along the foot of the Him\u00e1layas, and including some of their outermost spurs, in the north-east of Jalpaiguri District, Bengal. The Western Dw\u00e1rs, together with their continuation, the Eastern Dwars (q.v.), were annexed to the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal as the result of the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n war of 1864\u201365. The Eastern Dw\u00e1rs now form part of the Chief-Commissionership of Assam (Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District); while the Western Dw\u00e1rs remain under the Bengal Government. The entire tract contains a large area of waste land covered with jungle, but intersected by streams from the mountains, and well suited for reclamation. A considerable population of husbandmen has already moved into the Dw\u00e1rs; and the Western Dw\u00e1rs have been lately (1881\u201384) opened for tea-planting on a large scale. Grants of land for the latter purpose have been taken up with increasing rapidity, and tea-planting is being pushed forward, not only by private persons, but also by companies commanding an amount of capital almost unprecedented in this line of industry. The labour difficulty which has to be encountered in Assam, occurs here in a much less serious form. Large numbers of coolies find their way into the Western Dw\u00e1rs under the guidance of native contractors, without the intervention of the Labour Transport Laws. They receive high wages in the tea-gardens, and most of them return to their villages in the interior of Bengal with con-\nsiderable savings, after a few years. Indeed, the success of free immigration into the Western Dw\u00e1rs holds out a hopeful promise for the settlement of the difficulties attending the movement of labour to other tea-growing tracts. The climate is unhealthy, but this deterrent influence disappears as the jungle is cleared, and considerable tracts are opened up, and as substantial houses are built for the planters, and suitable coolie lines for the labourers.\n\nThe Western Dwarfs, now called pargan\u00e1s, extend from the Sankos river on the east, which forms the boundary between Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 and Jalp\u00e1gur\u00ed Districts, and the T\u00edst\u00e1 river on the west. They are 9 in number, viz.:\u2014(1) BHALKA, area (1881) 119 square miles; (2) BHATIBARI, area 149 square miles; (3) BAXA, area 300 square miles; (4) CHAKAO-KSHATTRIYA, area 138 square miles; (5) MADARI, area 194 square miles; (6) LAKSHMIPUR, area 165 square miles; (7) MARAGHAT, area 342 square miles; (8) MAINAGURI, area 309 square miles; (9) CHENGMARI, area 146 square miles.\n\nE.\n\nEastern Dw\u00e1rs.\u2014Tract of country in Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Assam.\u2014See DWARS, EASTERN.\n\nEastern Gh\u00e1ts.\u2014Mountain range extending along the eastern coast of India.\u2014See GHATS.\n\nEdap\u00e1di.\u2014Town in Salem District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 3942, namely, 3650 Hindus, 277 Muhammadans, and 15 Christians.\n\nEdar (Idar).\u2014The principal R\u00e1jput State of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha Agency in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency; bounded on the north by Sirohi (Sirohee) and Udaipur (Oodeypore), on the east by D\u00fangarpur, and on the south and west by the territories of the Bombay Presidency and of the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda. Population (1881) 258,429, including 10,916 Bhils; estimated gross revenue, including transit dues, \u00a352,444. The area of the State, according to the Census statement of 1881, was returned at 4966 square miles, of which the cultivable waste was estimated at 833 square miles, and the non-cultivable at about the same. The number of towns and villages in the State, excluding the hamlets of the Bhils, was returned by the Census at 805, containing 56,602 occupied and 12,052 unoccupied houses. The Bhil population occupied 2729 houses in 94 hamlets. In the whole population the males numbered 131,823, the females 126,606. Number of persons per square mile, 52. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 243,399; Muhammadans, 8760; Jains, 6266; there were also 3 P\u00e1rs\u00eds and 1 Christian. Among the Hindus, 17,441 were\nBr\u00e1hmans, and 10,309 R\u00e1jputs. The soil of the State is generally fertile; in some places it is of a light sandy nature, in others rich and black; towards the north and north-eastern parts near the hills, poor and stony. A peculiar feature of the country is the abundance of mahu\u00e1, mango, khirni, and other fruit-trees. The jungle in some parts, particularly at the foot of the hills, is very thick and intersected with ravines. Principal products\u2014grains, oil-seeds, sugar-cane. Manufactures\u2014a small quantity of country soap. There are quarries in the neighbourhood of Ahmadnagar, and the stone is used for building purposes.\n\nThe greater part of the population are Kol\u00eds, the remainder consists of R\u00e1jputs, Br\u00e1hmans, Baniy\u00e1s, Kumb\u00eds, etc. The present ruling family, though R\u00e1jputs of the most ancient lineage, only arrived in Edar at a comparatively recent date. Tradition relates that the original sovereigns of Edar, as in most of the rest of Gujar\u00e1t, were Bhals\u00far Kol\u00eds. The last chief of this tribe was named Sambla. A debauched and vicious man, his ministers conspired against him, and invited R\u00e1o Sonag of Simatra, the ancestor of the R\u00e1os of Pol, to their aid. This chief killed Sambla, and took possession of his territory. About twelve generations of this family are reckoned to the expulsion of Jagann\u00e1th, the last R\u00e1o of Edar, in 1656, by Mur\u00e1d Baksh, at that time the Subahd\u00e1r of Gujar\u00e1t. A Desai or Deputy was afterwards placed in charge of Edar for some years. In 1729, Anand Singh and R\u00e1i Singh, two brothers of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jodhpur, accompanied by a few horsemen from Vamo and P\u00e1lanpur and the Kol\u00eds of Godw\u00e1ra, established themselves in Edar without much difficulty. This family is the last that effected a settlement in Gujar\u00e1t by conquest. They are said to have acted under an order from Delhi; but the truth seems to be that they were tempted by the state of the country, and most likely assisted by the M\u00e1rw\u00e1r princes who at that period held the Subahd\u00e1ri of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. The Edar principality consisted of the Districts of Edar, Ahmadnagar, Mor\u00e1sa, B\u00e1ad, Harsol, Par\u00e1ntij, and Vij\u00e1pur, to which five other Districts were rendered tributary. Some years after the conquest, at the instigation of the Desai above mentioned, who appears to have been displaced by the M\u00e1rw\u00e1r\u00eds, an officer in the service of Dam\u00e1j\u00ed G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r, named Bach\u00e1j\u00ed Duv\u00e1j\u00ed, was despatched on the part of the Peshw\u00e1 to take possession of Edar. This he accomplished with the aid of the Rahw\u00e1r R\u00e1jputs, the servants of the late R\u00e1o. Anand Singh was killed about 1753; and Bach\u00e1j\u00ed, after leaving a detachment behind, returned to Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. R\u00e1i Singh, however, collected a force, and again obtained possession of Edar. Seo Singh, son of Anand Singh, now became ruler under the guardianship of his uncle R\u00e1i Singh, who died in 1766. During the rule of Seo Singh, the State was stripped, by the Peshw\u00e1, of Par\u00e1ntij, Vij\u00e1pur, and half of\nthe three Districts of Mor\u00e1sa, B\u00e1ad, and Harsol, which Districts were afterwards ceded by the Peshw\u00e1 to the British Government. The other half of the Edar territories fell to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r, who contented himself with the exaction of a share of the annual revenues, which at the settlement of 1812 was fixed in perpetuity at \u00a32400 for Edar, and \u00a3895 for Ahmadnagar. Seo Singh died in 1791, leaving five sons, the eldest of whom, Bhaw\u00e1n Singh, succeeded him, but died in a few days, leaving the State to his son Gambh\u00edr Singh, a boy of ten years. Dissensions in the family now arose, which resulted in the temporary dismemberment of Edar. Sugr\u00e1m Singh, second son of Seo Singh, who had received Ahmadnagar from his father in feudal grant, assumed independence; and with his assistance Zalim Singh and Am\u00edr Singh, two other sons of Seo Singh, after a long struggle possessed themselves respectively of Mor\u00e1sa and B\u00e1ad during Gambh\u00edr Singh\u2019s minority. Indra Singh, the fifth son of Seo Singh, who was blind, received S\u00far and three other villages for his support. Sugr\u00e1m Singh, chief of Ahmadnagar, died in 1798, and was succeeded by his son Kuran Singh. Zalim Singh of Mor\u00e1sa died childless in 1806, and his appanage ought to have lapsed to Edar. His widow, however, was allowed by the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r to adopt Prat\u00e1p Singh, Kuran Singh\u2019s brother, on whose death, in 1821, Mor\u00e1sa was united with Ahmadnagar. On the death of Am\u00edr Singh of B\u00e1ad without children, the reversion was claimed by both Edar and Ahmadnagar. The chief of Ahmadnagar, Kuran Singh, died in 1835, and was succeeded by his son Takht Singh, who was elected ruler of the State of Jodhpur in 1843. On his removal to Jodhpur, he still claimed the right to retain Ahmadnagar in his family; but in 1848, the British Government decided that Ahmadnagar should revert to Edar, and with it Mor\u00e1sa and B\u00e1ad.\n\nMah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Juw\u00e1n Singh, Knight Commander of the Star of India, and a member of the Legislative Council of Bombay, died in 1868, and was succeeded in 1882 by his son Keshri Singh, the present Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, who was born in 1861, and educated at the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r College at Indore. He is a R\u00e1jput of the Rahtor clan and of the Joda family. He exercises first-class jurisdiction, having power to inflict capital punishment. He holds a sanad giving him the right of adoption, and is entitled to a salute of 15 guns. Many relatives of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, and feudal chiefs whose ancestors helped to secure the country for the present dynasty, now enjoy large estates on service tenures. The revenues of the State are shared by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 with these feudal chiefs. In 1875, out of a total gross revenue of \u00a360,000, it was estimated that only \u00a325,000 was received by the central authority. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 receives \u00a31914 annually from several chiefs in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, and pays \u00a33034 as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda. The\nchiefs subordinate to Edar hold their estates on condition of military service, the quota being 3 horsemen for every \u00a3100 of revenue. The actual force maintained by them amounts to about 568 cavalry, and the same number of infantry, all undisciplined. The State contains 22 courts for criminal justice, and maintains a police force of 30 mounted and 418 foot, at an annual cost of \u00a33597. There are 25 schools with 1278 pupils, of which two are girls' schools. A forest reserve, covering 54 square miles, is in contemplation. The State has agreed to suppress the cultivation of poppy, and to prevent smuggling. A special establishment to grapple with the practice of infanticide has been working for some time. An attempt to induce the Bhils to send their children to school has failed; they laughingly say their sons must learn to drive cattle and use the bow. Transit dues are still levied in the State.\n\nEdar.\u2014Chief town of the State of Edar in Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency. Latitude 23\u00b0 50' N., longitude 73\u00b0 4' E.; 64 miles north-east of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. The town is traditionally known as Ild\u00farg. Population (1881) 6223, namely, 4206 Hindus, 970 Muhammadans, and 1047 Jains. Dispensary and post-office. The streets have recently been lighted.\n\nEdawauna.\u2014Village in Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency; situated in latitude 11\u00b0 59' 45\" N., and longitude 75\u00b0 45' 50\" E., on the left bank of the Beypore (Bepur) river, at the head of its navigable course, and 8 miles above Arikkod. Population (1881) 4800; number of houses, 820.\n\nEdwardes\u00e1b\u00e1d (or Dhul\u00edpnagar).\u2014Town, cantonment, and administrative head-quarters of Bannu District, Punjab. Population (1881) 8960, namely, 4284 Hindus, 4110 Muhammadans, 503 Sikhs, and 63 'others.' Situated in lat. 32\u00b0 59' 45\" N., and long. 70\u00b0 38' 51' E., near the north-west corner of the District, 1 mile south of the river Kuram, 84 miles south of Koh\u00e1t, and 89 miles north of Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n. Founded in 1848 by Major (afterwards Sir Herbert) Edwardes, who selected the site for political reasons. The fort, erected at the same time, bore the name of Dhul\u00edpgarh, in honour of the young Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 of Lahore; and the b\u00e1z\u00e1r was also known as Dhul\u00edpnagar. A town gradually grew up around the b\u00e1z\u00e1r, and many Hindu traders removed hither from the village of B\u00e1z\u00e1r Ahmad Kh\u00e1n, which formed the commercial centre of the Bannu valley prior to annexation. The main b\u00e1z\u00e1r consists of a wide and handsome roadway, and contains a fine market-place. A mud wall runs round the town, within which lie the tahs\u00edl and police office. The civil station, to the west of the fort, includes the court-house, treasury, jail, sard\u00ed, staging bungalow, dispensary, mounted police lines, and post-office. The Church Missionary Society supports a small church and a school-house. The cantor-\nment centres round the fort of Dhulipgarh, which possesses quarters for two infantry regiments; outside the fortifications are lines for a cavalry regiment and a field battery of artillery. There are also a few bungalows for officers. The profuse irrigation and insufficient drainage of the surrounding fields render Edwardes\u00e1b\u00e1d an unhealthy station; and the troops in cantonments suffer greatly from malarious fevers and prostration. The town has a considerable trade, embracing the whole traffic in local produce of the Bannu valley. The nearest railway station is at Kush\u00e1lgarh on the Punjab Northern State Railway, 124 miles distant by road. A weekly fair collects an average number of 2000 buyers and sellers. Chief articles of trade\u2014cloth, live stock, wool, cotton, tobacco, and grain.

Rises in the mountains west of the T\u00e1marasseri Pass, in latitude 11\u00b0 30' 0\" N., and longitude 75\u00b0 56' 0\" E., and, after a devious course of 30 miles through Malab\u00e1r District, flows into the extensive backwater which communicates with the sea near Elatt\u00far town, in latitude 11\u00b0 20' 30\" N., and longitude 75\u00b0 45' 45\" E. Near this town are several islets whence fine views of the Wain\u00e1d Mountains are obtained; it is a favourite resort of the residents of Calicut.\u2014See Alattur.\n\n**Elavarasanandal** (**Iliyarasainendal**).\u2014Group of agricultural hamlets in Tinneveli District, Madras Presidency. Latitude 9\u00b0 12' N., longitude 77\u00b0 50' E. Population (1881) 14,390; number of houses, 3059.\n\n**Elephanta** (called by the natives Gh\u00e1r\u00e1p\u00fari).\u2014Island in Bombay harbour, latitude 18\u00b0 57' N., and longitude 73\u00b0 E., about 6 miles from Bombay City and 4 from the shore of the mainland. Included in the Panwell Sub-division of Th\u00e1na District, Bombay Presidency. The island measures from 4 to 4\u00bd miles in circumference, and consists of two long hills separated by a narrow valley; the superficial area varies from 6 to 4 square miles according as the tide is at ebb or flow. It was named Elephanta by the Portuguese, from a large stone-elephant which stood near the old landing-place on the south side of the island. This elephant was 13 feet 2 inches in length, and about 7 feet 4 inches high; but its head\nand neck dropped off in 1814, and subsequently the body sank down into a shapeless mass of stones, which were removed in 1864 to the Victoria Gardens in Bombay. Near the point where the two hills approach each other, and not far to the south-east of the Great Cave, once stood the stone statue of a horse, described by an early writer as being 'so lively, with such a colour and carriage, and the shape finisht with that Exactness, that many have rather fancyed it, at a distance, a living Animal, than only a bare Representation.' This statue has disappeared. Except on the north-east and east, the hill-sides are covered with brushwood; in the hollows under the hill are clusters of mango, tamarind, and karanja trees. A broken line of palms stands out against the sky along the crest of the hill. Below is a belt of rice-land. The foreshore is of sand and mud, bare and black, with a fringe of mangrove bushes. At one period, from the 3rd to perhaps the 10th century, the island is supposed to have been the site of a city, and a place of religious resort. Some archaeologists would place here the Maurya city of Puri. The Caves are the chief objects of interest; but in the rice-fields to the east of the northern or Shet bandar (landing-place), brick and stone foundations, broken pillars, fallen statues of Siva, and other traces of an ancient city have been found. The landing-place is now on the north-west of the island. Steam launches or sailing boats, which can be hired at the Apollo Bunder, Bombay, run to Elephanta in about an hour; and a small steamer can lie alongside the pier which has been built at the landing-place.\n\nThe island is greatly resorted to by visitors to the far-famed rock-caves; in 1880-81 the number reached 5400. Of these wonderful excavations, four are complete or nearly so; a fifth is a large cave now much filled up, with only rough masses of stone left to support the roof; and a sixth is merely the beginning of the front of what seems to have been intended for a very small excavation\u2014possibly two or three cells for recluses. The most important and most frequently visited of these Brahmanic rock-temples is the Great Cave, which is situated in the western or larger of the two hills of the island, at an elevation of about 250 feet above high-water level. The entrance is reached by a winding path about three-quarters of a mile in length from the landing-place. The cave faces the north, and is entirely hewn out of a hard compact variety of trap rock. From the front entrance to the back it measures about 130 feet, and its length from the east to the west entrance is the same. It does not, however, occupy the entire square of this area. What may be called the porticoes, or the three open sides, are only about 54 feet long and 16\u00bd feet deep. Omitting these and the back aisle, immediately in front of three of the principal sculptured compartments, which is of about the same dimen-\nsions as each portico, the body of the cave may be considered as a square of about 91 feet each way, supported by 6 rows of columns with 6 columns in each row, except at the corners, where the uniformity is broken on the west side to make room for the shrine or sacellum, which occupies a space equal to that enclosed by four of the columns. There were originally 26 columns, with 16 half-columns; but 8 of the separate pillars have been destroyed, and others are much injured. As neither the floor nor the roof is perfectly horizontal, they vary in height from 15 to 17 feet. The most striking of the sculptures is the famous colossal three-faced bust, or trimurti, at the back of the cave, facing the entrance. This is a representation of Siva in his threefold character of Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer; and all the other sculptures relate to the same god, the cave being, like every other Hindu rock-temple of Western India, a Sivaite one. The trimurti is 17 feet 10 inches in height; and a line drawn round the three heads at the level of the eyes measures 22 feet 9 inches in length. The length of the middle face (Vishnu's) is 4 feet 4 inches; those of the others (Brahma and R\u00fadra), 4 feet 1 inch and about 5 feet. In 1865, this unique bust was mutilated by some 'barbarian clothed in the garb of civilisation,' who broke off a portion of the noses of two of the faces; and since then some of the other sculptures in the temple have been similarly treated, so that it has been found necessary to place a sergeant and two native policemen to protect the cave. The trimurti is guarded by two gigantic dw\u00e1rap\u00e1las or doorkeepers of rock, respectively 12 feet 9 inches and 13 feet 6 inches high; both figures are much defaced. The Linga chapel, on the right-hand side of the temple on entering, contains several dw\u00e1rap\u00e1las and other figures; and two compartments on either side of the trimurti are also ornamented with numerous sculptured groups. There are several other compartments in the Great Cave, all containing interesting sculptures, of which it is impossible to give even a bare list in the limits here available. The reader who desires to pursue the subject cannot do better than consult the lucid and exhaustive account of Mr. Burgess (The Rock Temples of Elephanta or Gh\u00e1r\u00e1puri, Bombay 1871), from which this article is chiefly condensed.\n\n'The impression on the mind,' writes Mr. Burgess, 'may be imagined rather than described, when one enters the portico [of the Great Cave], passing from the glare and heat of tropical sunshine to the dim light and cool air of the temple, and realizes that he is under a vast roof of solid rock, that seems to be supported only by the ranges of massive columns that recede in the vistas on every side, some of which appear to have split or fallen under the tremendous superincumbent weight. And the feeling of strange uncertain awe that creeps over the mind is only prolonged when in the obscure light we begin to contemplate the\ngigantic stony figures ranged along the walls from which they seem to start, and from the living rock of which they are hewn.' De Couto describes the stone of the mountain where the temples have been carved as of a grey colour. The same traveller, writing at the beginning of the 17th century, continues:\u2014'But the whole body inside, the pillars, the figures, and everything else, was formerly covered with a coat of lime mixed with bitumen and other compositions, that made the temple bright and very beautiful, the features and workmanship showing very distinct, so that neither in silver nor in wax could such figures be engraved with greater nicety, fineness, or perfection.' At the present time there is no trace of this coating.\n\nThe Second Cave, which is situated a short distance to the south-east of the Great Temple, faces east-north-east, and is 109\u00bd feet in length, including the chapel at the north end. The fa\u00e7ade, which was nearly 80 feet in length, is completely destroyed, and the cave is so full of d\u00e9bris and so ruined by water that no proper estimate can now be formed of the appearance it originally represented. It contains at present only one sculptured group. At the south end of the portico of this cave is a large block of rock not hewn away, above which is a hole through a thin partition of rock into one of the cells of the Third Rock Temple. The proper entrance, however, is a little to the south. This cave is in an even more dilapidated condition than the second. The Fourth Temple, now known to the natives as 'S\u00edt\u00e1 B\u00e1\u00ed's Diw\u00e1la,' is situated on the other hill of the island, and about 100 feet above the level of the Great Cave. It is in better preservation than those last mentioned, and had formerly a beautiful gate with a marble porch of exquisite workmanship; but these have now disappeared.\n\nSufficient data do not exist to enable us to fix with precision the date of the Elephanta Caves. Tradition attributes them variously to the P\u00e1ndavas, to a king of K\u00e1nara named B\u00e1n\u00e1sur, and to Alexander the Great; and many not less unreasonable conjectures have been hazarded regarding them. Mr. Fergusson concludes (for reasons for which the reader is referred to his Rock-cut Temples of India) that the Great Temple was excavated in the 10th century of our era; but Mr. Burgess, while admitting that there are grounds for this conclusion, is inclined to attribute them to the latter part of the 8th or to the 9th century. No inscription is now to be found in the caves. It is hoped, however, that the date and name of the excavator may yet be learned from a stone, taken to Europe about 1540 by the Portuguese Viceroy Dom Joao de Castro, which may one day be re-discovered and deciphered.\n\nThe Great Temple is still used on Sivaite festivals, and specially by Hindus of the Baniy\u00e1 caste; and at the Sivar\u00e1tri, the greatest of the Sivaite festivals, just before the first new moon falling after the middle\nof February, a religious fair is held here. The view from the front of the great cave is very beautiful; and from the site of an old bungalow, not far from the porch, a fine prospect is commanded of Bombay harbour, with Butcher Island in the foreground.\n\n**Ellen\u00e1b\u00e1d (Khari\u00e1l).**\u2014Town and municipality in Sirsa tahsil, S\u00edrsa District, Punjab; situated in lat. 29\u00b0 26' N., and long. 75\u00b0 54' E., on the banks of the Ghaggar, 23 miles west of S\u00edrsa town. Founded in 1865 by Mr. Oliver, Deputy Commissioner, to replace the village of Khari\u00e1l on the opposite side of the Ghaggar, founded some 40 years before by settlers from Bik\u00e1ner (Bickaneer) State, which had been washed away by floods. Mr. Oliver called the new town Ellen\u00e1b\u00e1d, but it is still commonly known to the people as Khari\u00e1l. It is a small town, but notwithstanding a high death-rate, the population shows a steady increase at each successive Census.

The administrative headquarters are at Ellichpur Town.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The entire northern half of Ellichpur consists of a succession of hills and valleys known as the Melgh\u00e1t or G\u00e1wilgarh Hills, a section of the S\u00e1tpuras Mountains. The main ridge or watershed of the S\u00e1tpuras runs through the District from east to west, attaining its greatest elevation at Bair\u00e1t, 3987 feet above sea-level. The southern portion of the District is flat, and drained by numerous small streams flowing into the W\u00e1rdha and P\u00farn\u00e1 rivers. The only present metalled road is that from Ellichpur town to Amr\u00e1oti; but several other roads are under construction. The country roads and fair-weather tracks from village to village are passable for eight months in the year. In the hill country, the chief passes are by Hewra-dev\u00ed, Komi, and Malh\u00e1r\u00e1 on the east, and by D\u00falgh\u00e1t and Bing\u00e1ra on the west, of which those by Komi, Malh\u00e1r\u00e1, and D\u00falgh\u00e1t are practicable for wheeled vehicles. The country is well supplied with mango groves, and when the green crops cover it, has a very park-like appearance.\nPopulation.\u2014In 1867, a Census taken in Ber\u00e1r gave the population of Ellichpur District at 279,022. The Census of 1881 returned a population of 313,805; so that since the former year an increase of 34,783 has taken place. The more recent enumeration affords the following figures. Males number 162,590; females, 151,215. Density of population, 119\u00b76 persons per square mile. Number of towns, 6; villages, 727; occupied houses, 58,091, and unoccupied, 3945. Houses per square mile, 23\u00b76; persons per house, 5\u00b74. Distributed according to religion, Hindus number 282,000; Muhammadans, 30,299; Jains, 1280; Christians, 197; Sikhs, 27; and P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 2. According to caste, the Hindus are divided into Br\u00e1hmans (7422), R\u00e1jputs (4830), Kunb\u00eds, a cultivating caste (77,280), and \u2018others\u2019 unspecified (193,268). The strength of the Muhammadan tribes is as follows:\u2014Shaikhs, 19,714; Path\u00e1ns, 6453; Sayyids, 1801; Mughals, 565; unspecified (Arabs, Bh\u00edls, Fak\u00edrs), 1766. Among the Christians the Roman Catholics number 119. In regard to occupation the adult males are classed in six main groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including State officials of every kind and members of the learned professions, 5502; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 2607; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 2977; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including shepherds, 75,069; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 21,032; and (6) indefinite and non-productive class, including male children, general labourers, and persons of unspecified occupation, 55,403. The population is mostly Hindu, and their favourite God not Vishnu, but Mah\u00e1deo. The languages spoken are Urd\u00fa, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1, and Gond.\n\nAgriculture and Commerce.\u2014The principal agricultural products are cotton, jo\u00e1r, rice, and wheat (of excellent quality), gram, pulses, yams, and oil-seeds; and these, together with gh\u00ed and forest timber, comprise the chief exports of the District. Cotton is the staple of the valley, but mangoes, tamarinds, guavas, grapes, oranges, and pomegranates are cultivated in addition to the cereal crops. Tea is said to thrive in the Melgh\u00e1t. In 1882-83, 254,018 acres were under cotton; 207,458 acres under jo\u00e1r; 51,148 acres under wheat; and 4271 acres under tobacco. The imports are mainly English and country cloth, iron and copper utensils, tobacco, salt, sugar, etc.\n\nAs regards physical aspects and economic conditions, the Melgh\u00e1t, or Upper Tract, forms the most interesting part of Ellichpur District, and has been dealt with separately.\n\nHistory.\u2014The history of the District centres in Ellichpur town, which formed an important nucleus of Muhammadan influence in the Deccan. Tradition asserts that the city was founded by R\u00e1j\u00e1 II, a Jain, who came from Kh\u00e1nj\u00e1ma Nag\u00e1r, near W\u00e1dg\u00e1on, about 1058 A.D. Whatever may be the date of its foundation, the town holds\nno mean rank among the ancient historical cities of India, and during a short period it was a well-known capital. It lost most of its local importance from the time when the first Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk became supreme ruler in the Deccan, and the city was placed under a viceroy or governor. The first governor appointed was Iw\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n, who ruled for five years\u2014from 1724 to 1728\u2014and was succeeded by S\u00faj\u00e1yat Kh\u00e1n (1729 to 1740), who quarrelled with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Raghuji Bhonsla, fought with him near Bh\u00faga\u00f3n, and was killed in the battle. The Ellichpur treasury on that occasion was plundered by the victor. Shar\u00edf Kh\u00e1n next succeeded, and held office from 1741 to 1752. He claimed equality with the Niz\u00e1m, who consequently deposed him. The Niz\u00e1m\u2019s son, Al\u00ed J\u00e1h Bah\u00e1dur, was then appointed governor, but he administered by deputy, and was succeeded by Sal\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n, who, though he only remained two years at Ellichpur, did much to improve the city. He enlarged the palace, made a public garden, and extended the ancient water-channels. He was a brave soldier, and on the war breaking out between the Niz\u00e1m and Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, he was ordered to join the army, and distinguished himself there. He also saw service at the battle of Kardla, and was with General Wellesley\u2019s army in 1803. N\u00e1md\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, son of Sal\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n, received, besides his j\u00e1gir of 2 l\u00e1khs of rupees (\u00a320,000), another of like value at Ellichpur, and managed his estate with the title of Naw\u00e1b until his death in 1843. He is said to have been placed specially under the protection of General Wellesley by his father, and he received a j\u00e1gir for the payment of the Ellichpur brigade. After some years, getting into arrears, he gave up the greater part of his j\u00e1gir, retaining only a rental of \u00a33500. N\u00e1md\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n was succeeded by his nephew, Ibr\u00e1him Kh\u00e1n, who lived till 1846, when his widow\u2019s father, Ghul\u00e1m Hassan, was allowed to inherit the estate and the title of Naw\u00e1b, on payment of a nazar\u00e1na of 7 l\u00e1khs. This sum he borrowed of a local banker, at whose suit the palace, with other property of the Naw\u00e1b at Ellichpur, is now under attachment. In 1853, the District was assigned to the British with the rest of Ber\u00e1r.\n\nFrom the time that the Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk declared his independence, the history of Ellichpur has been intimately connected with that of the family of Sh\u00e1di Kh\u00e1n and Nas\u00edf Kh\u00e1n, two Path\u00e1n zamind\u00e1rs, who originally came from Jaipur (Jeypore) to Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) as horse dealers; and there attracting the notice of the Niz\u00e1m, N\u00e1sir Jang, rose to high importance. From their descendants the governors of Ellichpur were generally chosen; of these, Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n, Sal\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n, Ball\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n, N\u00e1md\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, and Ibr\u00e1him Kh\u00e1n were governors of Ellichpur, N\u00e1md\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n receiving the title of Naw\u00e1b.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1882\u201383, the administration was carried on by 6 civil judges and 10 subordinate magistrates. The gross revenue was\n\u00a3123,652, of which \u00a392,251 was derived from the land. The number of police in 1882 was 260, maintained at a cost of \u00a34299. Average distance between a village and its nearest court, 38 miles. The chief towns of the District are Ellichpur (26,728), Anjang\u00e1on (9842), Paratwada (9445), and Karajg\u00e1on (7330). Ellichpur is the only municipality. No railroads run through the District, and there are only 65\u00bd miles of made road. Average daily population of District jail in 1882, 53. Number of schools in 1883, 135; of scholars, 5437; schools to each 100 square miles, 5. A printing-press issues a weekly newspaper at Ellichpur town.\n\nClimate.\u2014From November to March may be considered the cold season. Even then the sun is very powerful at mid-day. The nights are cold, but frost is rare. The rains commence about the 10th of June and last until the end of August. September and October are the most unhealthy months. Cholera, small-pox, fevers, ague, and a severe form of rheumatism called w\u00e1di, are prevalent. For the climate of the Melghat, see that article. In 1882, the rainfall at Ellichpur town was 29'4 inches; average temperature, from 97\u00b0 F. in May to 56\u00b0 in December. There are 6 dispensaries; total patients relieved in 1882, 31,009, at a cost of \u00a31240. Vaccinations in same year, 10,958. [For further information regarding Ellichpur, see the Ber\u00e1r Gazetteer, edited by Sir Alfred C. Lyall, K.C.B., Bombay, 1870; also Settlement Report of the Amr\u00e1oti and Ellichpur t\u00e1luk, by Major P. A. Elphinstone, Bombay, 1870; the Ber\u00e1r Census Report of 1881; and the Ber\u00e1r Administration and Departmental Reports from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nEllichpur.\u2014T\u00e1luk of Ellichpur District, Ber\u00e1r. Area, 469 square miles; contains 5 towns and 208 villages. Population (1881) 148,041, namely, 76,514 males and 71,527 females, or 315 persons per square mile. Hindus number 127,751; Muhammadans, 19,304; Jains, 785; Christians, 172; and Sikhs, 9. The agricultural population numbers 76,651. In 1883, the t\u00e1luk contained 4 civil and 6 criminal courts, including the head-quarters\u2019 courts; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 6; regular police, 193 men; village watch (chaukid\u00e1rs), 411. Total revenue, \u00a356,205, of which \u00a340,359 is derived from land. Area occupied by cultivators, 258,110 acres.\n\nEllichpur.\u2014Chief town and municipality of Ellichpur District, Ber\u00e1r. Lat. 21\u00b0 15' 30\" N., long. 77\u00b0 29' 30\" E. Population (1881) 26,728, namely, 13,346 males and 13,382 females. Of the total population, 19,092 were returned as Hindus, 7428 as Musalm\u00e1ns, and 208 as Jains. Ellichpur was once a great and prosperous city, and is said to have contained 40,000 houses. It is not on any line of traffic, nor is it the centre of any particular trade, but it was the capital of a local Government, until the first Niz\u00e1m, throwing off his dependence on Delhi, became supreme ruler\nof the Deccan. Ellichpur was then placed under a viceroy or governor, and from this time it declined rapidly. The town contains several interesting buildings. The *dargah* or burial shrine, in memory of Dalla R\u00e1hman, built 400 years ago by one of the B\u00e1bhami kings, on the banks of the Bichan river, has a spacious *chab\u00fatra* or masonry platform, 11 bastions, and 4 gates, and is endowed by the State. The extensive palace, built by Sal\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n and Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n, and afterwards added to by N\u00e1md\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, has some good carving and stonework, but is rapidly falling to ruin. Some of the tombs of the Naw\u00e1bs, commenced by Sal\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n sixty or seventy years ago, are very handsome. A detached fort, called Sult\u00e1n Garhi, built more than a hundred years ago by Sult\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, and a well (said to be 500 years old) called Mamel Sh\u00e1h, built of stone finely cut, are also worthy of notice. An English-Mar\u00e1th\u00ed school is maintained, and also a school for girls. Police stations, dispensary, etc. Municipal revenue in 1881, \u00a31487; incidence of taxation, 1s. 1d. per head of population within municipal limits.\n\nAbout 2 miles from the city, on the Bichan stream, lies Paratwada, the military cantonment and civil station. A force of all arms of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Contingent is generally stationed here. In 1882-83 there were 73 cavalry, a battery of artillery with 125 men, and 765 infantry. The cantonment is well laid out; the hills in the background give it an attractive appearance, but the site is low, and it lies too near the hills to be quite healthy. A police station and reserve guard are located in the b\u00e1z\u00e1r. English school and two others in the b\u00e1z\u00e1r\u2014one for boys and one for girls. A Government garden has also been formed. The courts of the Deputy Commissioner, and of two Assistant Commissioners, with a treasury, are situated here. The population varies with the strength of the troops; in 1881 the total was 9445.\n\n**Ellora** (*Eluru* or *Verul*). \u2014 Village in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, Deccan. Lat. 20\u00b0 2' N., long. 75\u00b0 13' E. Distant northwest from Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d 13 miles, from Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d 7 miles. Population (1881) 742. The village is partly walled, and contains a Muhammadan shrine famed throughout the Deccan for its marvellous healing powers. Ellora is famous for its rock-caves and temples. These contain, besides the symbols of Sanskrit mythology and statues of the Hindu deities, several Jain and Buddhist objects of worship.\n\nThe road from Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d to the caves winds round the base of the fortress of Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d, and traverses the P\u00edpal gh\u00e1t to Raoza, below which the caves are excavated. The P\u00edpal gh\u00e1t, or road upward, is so called from the p\u00edpal or sacred trees of the Hindus which line its sides. Half-way up the arduous ascent stand two pillars inscribed with the names of some nobles of the Court of Aurangzeb, who are supposed to have paved the road to the caves.\nThe caves are first mentioned by Mahsudi, the Arabic geographer of the 10th century, but merely as a celebrated place of pilgrimage. They were visited in 1306 by Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn or his generals, when, as Dow (History of Hindostan) relates, the capture occurred of a Hindu princess of Gujar\u00e1t, who was here in concealment from the Muhammadans, but was afterwards carried to Delhi and married to the Emperor's son. Thevenot is said to be the first European who has described the caves; in the quaint style of the traveller of his period (1667) he details a visit to the 'Pagods of Elora.' The hill or plateau in which the caves are situated is crescent-shaped. Contrasting the caves of Ellora and Ajant\u00e1, Mr. Fergusson writes: 'Architecturally the Ellora caves differ from those of Ajant\u00e1, in consequence of their being excavated in the sloping sides of a hill, and not in a nearly perpendicular cliff. From this formation of the ground, almost all the caves at Ellora have courtyards in front of them. Frequently, also, an outer wall of rock, with an entrance through it, is left standing; so that the caves are not generally seen from the outside at all, and a person might pass along their front without being aware of their existence, unless warned of the fact.' The caves extend along the face of the hill for a mile and a quarter. They are divided into three distinct series, the Buddhist, the Br\u00e1hmanical, and the Jain, and are arranged almost chronologically.\n\n'The caves,' writes Mr. Burgess, the Archaeological Surveyor to the Government of Bombay, 'are excavated in the face of a hill, or rather the scarp of a large plateau, and run nearly north and south for about a mile and a quarter, the scarp at each end of this interval throwing out a horn towards the west. It is where the scarp at the south end begins to turn to the west that the earliest caves\u2014a group of Buddhistic ones\u2014are situated; and in the north horn is the Indra Sabh\u00e1 or Jain group, the other extremity of the series. The ascent of the gh\u00e1t passes up the south side of Kail\u00e1s, the third of the Br\u00e1hmanical group, and over the roof of the D\u00e1s Avat\u00e1ra, the second of them. Sixteen caves lie to the south of Kail\u00e1s, and nearly as many to the north, but the latter are scattered over a greater distance.\n\n'Most of the caves have got distinguishing names from the local Br\u00e1hmans; but it may be quite as convenient, for the sake of reference, to number them from south to north, beginning with the Buddhist caves, of which there are twelve, and passing through the Br\u00e1hmanical series, of which seventeen are below the brow of the scarp, and a large number of smaller ones above, and ending with the Jain ones, of which there are five at the extreme north. There are also some cells and a colossal Jain image on the north side of the same spur in which is the Indra Sabh\u00e1.'\n\nThe chief building, called the Kail\u00e1s\u2014a perfect Dravidian temple, complete in all its parts\u2014is characterised by Fergusson (History of\nIndian and Eastern Architecture, p. 334) as one of the most wonderful and interesting monuments of architectural art in India. 'Its beauty and singularity,' continues Mr. Fergusson, 'always excited the astonishment of travellers, and in consequence it is better known than almost any other structure in that country from the numerous views and sketches of it that have been published. . . . It is not a mere interior chamber cut in the rock, but is a model of a complete temple such as might have been erected on the plain. In other words, the rock has been cut away externally as well as internally.' This wonderful structure, of which a detailed account is given by Fergusson (loc. cit.), measures 138 feet in front; the interior is 247 feet in length by 150 feet in breadth, the height in some places being 100 feet. This temple, as well as the others (which are also described by Fergusson), is said to have been built about the 8th century by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Edu of Ellichpur\u2014by whom the town of Ellora was founded\u2014as a thankoffering for a cure effected by the waters of a spring near the place.\n\n'All the sculptures and the whole architectural style of the central temple,' says Mr. Burgess, the Archaeological Surveyor of Bombay, 'impress me with the conviction that it is later than the P\u00e1pan\u00e1th temple at Pattadkal, but probably earlier than the great Sivaite temple of Vir\u00fap\u00e1ksh\u00e1deva there. It has at one time all been painted in a style befitting its elaborateness of sculpture. This painting has been renewed again and again, perhaps in a continuous succession of debased styles, the latest certainly poor enough. But there are still some bits in the roof of the porch, of two or three successive coatings, that would compare favourably even among many of the Ajant\u00e1 paintings. The lofty basement of the temple is of itself a remarkable conception, with its row of huge elephants and s\u00e1rdulas or lions, griffins, etc., in every possible attitude, tearing one another or feeding. And then the great hall above, with its sixteen pillars and more pilasters, all carved with different details of sculpture; its balcony porches at the sides, and double pavilions before the front porch; its vestibule to the sanctuary, with large sculptures on each side; and its five shrines round the outside of the principal one and on the same platform, all testify to the attempt made to rival and outdo all previous temples of the kind.\n\n'Dedicated to Siva, it is surrounded with figures also of Vishnu and the whole Pur\u00e1nic pantheon. Its sculptures bear testimony to the prevalence of the eclectic Smartha school. The interior, and parts at least, if not the whole, of the exterior, have been plastered over and painted; and, where this has not very long ago peeled off, has had the effect of preserving the stone inside from the smoke of wandering j\u00f6g\u00eds' and travellers' fires, with which it must for ages have been saturated.\n\n'Unlike any of the preceding cave-temples, Kail\u00e1s is a great monolithic temple, isolated from surrounding rock, and carved outside as well\nas in. It stands in a great court averaging 154 feet wide by 276 feet long at the level of the base, entirely cut out of the solid rock, and with a scarp 107 feet high at the back. In front of this court a curtain has been left, carved on the outside with the monstrous forms of Siva and Vishnu and their congeners, and with rooms inside it. It is pierced in the centre by an entrance passage with rooms on each side. Passing this, the visitor is met by a large sculpture of Lakshmi over the lotuses, with her attendant elephants. There are some letters and a date on the leaves of the lotus, on which she sits, but illegible, and probably belonging to the 15th century. On the bases of the pilasters on each side have been inscriptions in characters of the 8th century.\n\nAs we enter, to right and left is the front portion of the court, which is a few feet lower than the rest, and at the north and south ends of which stand two gigantic elephants,\u2014that on the south much mutilated. Turning again to the east and ascending a few steps, we enter the great court occupied by the temple, whose base measures 164 feet from east to west, by 109 feet where widest from north to south. In front of it, and connected by a bridge, is a mandapa for the Nandi, and on each side of this mandap stands a pillar or dvajadand\u2014\u201censign staff\u201d\u201445 feet high, or with what remains of the trisula of Siva on the top, a total height of about 49 feet.\n\nEllora was ceded in 1818 by Holkar to the British, who transferred it to the Niz\u00e1m, in 1822, by the treaty of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\n**Ellore (El\u00far).\u2014T\u00e1luk of God\u00e1vari District, Madras Presidency.**\n\nArea, 729 square miles, containing 248 villages and 29,015 houses. Population (1881) 149,308, namely, 140,689 Hindus, 8019 Muhammadans, and 600 Christians. No other t\u00e1luk of the District contains so many Muhammadans. The country is to a great extent covered with jungle. The arable land amounts to 118,381 acres, paying a revenue of \u00a323,804, while other sources (water cess, quit-rent, etc.) raise the total revenue to \u00a326,587. The canals that pass through the t\u00e1luk connect its chief town, Ellore, with R\u00e1j\u00e1ma-hendri (Rajahmundry), etc., and besides irrigating the t\u00e1luk, afford a highway for the export of grain. In 1883, the t\u00e1luk contained 1 civil and 3 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 17; regular police, 199 men.\n\n**Ellore (El\u00faru; elu, \u2018ruling\u2019\u2014uru, \u2018town\u2019).\u2014Town in God\u00e1vari District, Madras Presidency. Latitude 16\u00b0 42' 35\" N., longitude 81\u00b0 9' 5\" E. Population (1881) 25,092, namely, Hindus, 20,391; Muhammadans, 4453; and Christians, 248. Number of houses, 4133. Situated 255 miles north of Madras, on the Tammal\u00e9r river. The high-level canal from Vijeshwaram passes through the t\u00e1luk, and joins the Bezw\u00e1ra canal at Ellore, where the waters of the God\u00e1vari and Kistna unite. The Ellore Canal from Chittapetta to Ellore is 40 miles\nin length. As the head-quarters of the taluk, Ellore possesses the usual subordinate magisterial and judicial establishments, police station, post-office, school, etc.; it is also the station of the Head Assistant Collector, and of a local fund engineer. Both Church Missionary and Roman Catholic missions are established here. The municipal income for 1883 was \u00a31991; incidence of taxation, 1s. 1\u00bdd. per head of the population. Manufactures of woollen carpets and saltpetre are the chief industries. Historically Ellore is of importance as having been the capital of the Northern Circars. Originally portion of the Vengi kingdom, it probably formed part of the Orissa conquests till 1480, when it was occupied by the Muhammadans. Under the supremacy of the Vijayanagar kingdom, Ellore became once more Hindu; but early in the 16th century it was captured by Kutab Shah of Golconda, by whom and his successors it was held against the Rajputs of Rajamahendri (Rajahmundry) and the Reddis and Kois of the surrounding country, who perpetually harassed the garrison, until the Golconda power was merged in the Subah or Muhammadan viceroyalty of the Deccan. In later history, Ellore shared in the vicissitudes common to the other Circars, being in turn possessed by native princes, by the French, and finally by the British. (See Northern Circars.) The ruins of the old fort, built from the Buddhist remains of the ancient capital of the Chalukyas at Vengi, 8 miles to the north, are still visible near the town; the modern barracks now form the offices of the subdivisional officer. The heat here is remarkable, even for so hot a District, the thermometer rising to 110\u00b0 F. in the shade.\n\nEminabad.\u2014Town in the Gujranwala tahsil of Gujranwala District, Punjab. Situated in lat. 32\u00b0 2' 15\" N., and long. 74\u00b0 18' E., on the Grand Trunk Road, 9 miles south of Gujranwala town. Population (1881) 5886, namely, 1764 Hindus, 4103 Muhammadans, and 19 Sikhs. Now a town of small importance, but perhaps the most ancient in the District; particulars, however, of its early history are not recorded. It figures in the Ain-i-Akbari, as the head-quarters of a large mahal or fiscal division, and contains some fine ruined specimens of Muhammadan architecture, dating from imperial times. Residence of a leading Kshatriya family, whose members include Jawala Sahai, minister to the Maharaja of Jammu (Kashmir), and the late Diwan Haribhand. The town has several streets, a grain market, police station, and schoolhouse. Trade insignificant. Considerable annual fair for three days in the month of Baisakh (about the middle of April). A third-class municipality, with an income in 1882-83 of \u00a3210; average incidence of taxation, 8\u00bdd. per head of the population.\n\nEnglish Bazar (or Angrazabad).\u2014Town, municipality, and administrative head-quarters of Maldah District, Bengal. Situated in lat. 25\u00b0 0' 14\" N., and long. 88\u00b0 11' 20\" E. Population (1881) 12,430,\nnamely, Hindus, 7268; Muhammadans, 5146; and 'others,' 16; area of site, 1500 acres. Municipal income (1881-82), \u00a3696, of which \u00a3498 was derived from taxation; incidence of municipal taxation, 9\u00bdd. per head; expenditure, \u00a3716. The town consists of a series of trading villages lining the right bank of the Mah\u00e1nand\u00e1 for a considerable distance. Being an open elevated site on the river bank in a mulberry-growing country, it was chosen at an early date as the site of one of the Company's silk factories. The French and the Dutch had also settlements here; and the residence of the superintendent of police was formerly a Dutch convent. The East India Company's factory was of considerable importance during the last quarter of the 17th century, and its 'Diaries and Consultations,' from 1685 to 1693 (with breaks), are still preserved in the India Office under the title of 'Maulda and Englesavad.' In 1770, English B\u00e1z\u00e1r was fixed upon for a commercial residency, and retained its importance until the discontinuance of the Company's private trade in 1836. An extensive trade in grain is now carried on. The largest building is the public Cutcherry (Kach\u00e1ri) or Court-House, originally a factory of the East India Company. It is regularly fortified, and within its walls are all the public offices of the District. A small embankment protects the town from inundations, which are of frequent occurrence in Maldah District.\n\n**Eng-rai (In-rai).**\u2014Town in Bassein District, British Burma; situated on the right bank of the Daga river, in latitude 17\u00b0 10' 30\" N., and longitude 95\u00b0 18' 30\" E. Formerly the head-quarters of the extra-Assistant Commissioner.\n\n**Eng-rai-gyi (In-rai-gyi).**\u2014Lake in Bassein District, British Burma; about 3 miles in circumference, with a fairly uniform breadth of from 280 to 300 yards, and a depth of from 20 to 45 feet in the centre. It is connected with the Daga branch of the Bassein by a small outlet, which serves to replenish the lake from the Irawadi (Irrawaddy) and to carry off the surplus water. This lake is by some supposed to be a former portion of the bed of the Daga, by others it is thought to have been caused by a slip of the lower-lying beds, totally independent of fluvial action. It is very valuable as a preserve for fish, and proved an important source of revenue to the Burmes\u00e8 Government, who exacted an annual tax of \u00a3780 from the Paineng or hereditary chief of the lake, who had sole authority over the villagers employed in the fishery. Each villager had the right of investing his capital in the general working of the fishery, and received a share in the out-turn at the end of the season proportionate to the sum subscribed. The process of dragging the lake is performed by floating capstans worked by hawsers of jungle rope attached to a frame, and occupies three months' working, at the rate of about 45 fathoms each day. The fishing begins with the full moon in June, when the temperature of the water has been\nreduced by the first showers of the monsoon. The number of fish caught is never below 70,000 to 80,000 of all kinds; the principal belonging for the most part to the genera of Cerca, Cyprinus, Gobio, Labeo, Cimelodus, Cirrhus, Cyprinodon, and Silurus. The largest specimens weigh about 56 lbs. each. Crocodiles of all sizes are found in the drag-net, but no casualty has been known to have been caused by them. Some 8000 to 10,000 persons are engaged in the taking and disposal of the fish, of which about 40 tons are annually sold on the spot.\n\n**Ennore (Ennur).** \u2014 Town in Chengalpat District, Madras Presidency; also called Kattivakam. Latitude 13\u00b0 13' 40\" N., longitude 80\u00b0 21' 55\" E. Population (1881) 1453, namely, 1418 Hindus, 26 Muhammadans, and 9 Christians. Number of houses, 233. Ennore is in reality only a fishing village; but being a favourite resort of Europeans from Madras, it contains several bungalows, built on the strip of land between the sea and the back-water; and, until lately, the oldest clubhouse in India. Situated 12 miles north of Madras, to which there is some export of the salt manufactured here. Manufacture of salt in 1878, 36,000 tons. In 1769, Haidar Ali encamped near Ennore.\n\n**Entalli.** \u2014 Suburb of Calcutta, Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal. Lat. 22\u00b0 33' 15\" N., long. 88\u00b0 24' 30\" E. Contains an English school, a large native school belonging to the Baptists, and a Roman Catholic convent.\n\n**Eran.** \u2014 Chief village of a tract of the same name in Sagar (Saugor) District, Central Provinces, 48 miles west of Sagar town. Lat. 24\u00b0 5' 30\" N., long. 78\u00b0 15' E. Population (1881) 339; number of houses, 84. Eran is remarkable for its monumental remains, attributed to Rajah Bharat. The chief of these is a rudely-shaped image of Vishnu in his manifestation as the boar. The animal stands about 10 feet high, with his snout in the air. Successive rows of small figures in short tunics and high caps cover the body; while a band, ornamented with seated figures, encircles the neck. The tip of the projecting tongue supports a human figure erect. The breast bears an inscription, and, as at Oodehghir (Udaigarh), a young female hangs by the arm from the right tusk. On one side of Vishnu stands a four-armed deity, more than 12 feet high, with girt loins, a high cap, and round his neck and reaching to his feet a thick ornamental cord. On the columns before this statue are seen figures weaving the sacred thread, with twisted snakes, elephants, nude female figures, seated Buddhas, faces of satyrs, and other devices. Besides these and other remains, there are three figures of crouching lions; and in front of them, a pillar, and a small temple half buried in the soil. The pillar has a broad base, for about 15 feet the shaft is square, and for about 10 feet more round. The bell capital occupies 2 feet, and sustains a pedestal about 3 feet\nhigh, on which stands a small double-fronted four-armed statue. From the inscription on this column the date of Buddha Gupta, of the great Gupta line of Magadha, has been established. Police outpost station.\n\n**Erandol.**\u2014Sub-division of Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency. Bounded on the north by the T\u00e1pti; on the north-east and east by the Girna; on the south by P\u00e1chora; and on the west by Amalner. Area, 460 square miles; contains 2 towns and 196 villages. Population (1881) 90,872, namely, 46,296 males and 44,576 females. Hindus number 76,379; Muhammadans, 9327; 'others,' 5166. The soil is part of the fertile T\u00e1pti valley. Mango groves are scattered all through the Sub-division. Besides water-supply from the rivers, there were in 1879\u201380, 2061 wells of which the average depth was 35 feet. The Sub-division of Erandol was surveyed and settled in 1858\u201359. There were then 8774 holdings with an average area of 21.2 acres, and an average rental of \u00a32, 7s. 5\u00bdd. In 1879, there were under tillage 193,256 acres, of which 37 per cent. were under jo\u00e1r (millet), and 34 per cent. under cotton. Rice, wheat, pulses, and oil-seeds occupied the remainder. Land revenue (1883), \u00a324,828.\n\n**Erandol.**\u2014Chief town of the Sub-division of Erandol in Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency; situated on the Anj\u00e1ni river, 40 miles east of Dhuli\u00e1. Latitude 20\u00b0 56' N., longitude 75\u00b0 20' 30\" E. Population (1881) 11,501, namely, 8681 Hindus, 2558 Muhammadans, and 13 Jains. Municipal revenue (1881\u201382), \u00a3586; rate of taxation, 1s. per head. Sub-judge's court, post-office, and dispensary. Erandol is connected by metalled roads with the towns of Dhuli\u00e1, Dharang\u00e1on (7 miles north-west), and with the railway station of Mah\u00e1s\u00e1war (9 miles south-east). It is a place of some antiquity, and was formerly celebrated for its manufacture of coarse native paper, an industry which still survives to a limited extent. There is a considerable local trade in cotton, indigo, and grain; the chief market being Jalga\u00f3n, a station 14 miles north-east.\n\n**Ern\u00e1d** (Er\u00e1n\u00e1du or Er\u00e1din\u00e1d).\u2014T\u00e1luk in Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency. Area, 811 square miles, containing 52 villages. Houses, 54,415. Population (1881) 296,143, namely, 148,521 males and 147,622 females. Hindus number 145,451; Muhammadans, 149,987; Christians, 699; and 'others,' 6. In 1883 the t\u00e1luk contained 3 civil and 2 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 13; regular police, 112 men. Land revenue, \u00a320,005.\n\n**Ernag\u00fadem.**\u2014T\u00e1luk of God\u00e1vari District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See YERNAGUDEM.\n\n**Ernakolam** (Yernacoulam).\u2014Town in Cochin State, Madras; situated on the back-water 2 miles east of, and opposite to, Cochin town. Latitude 9\u00b0 58' 55\" N., longitude 76\u00b0 19' 21\" E. The chief officials of the State reside here; and the town also contains the\njudicial courts, several public offices, and a D\u00e1rb\u00e1r palace, where the British Resident pays his state visits to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Cochin. Some of the roads are metalled, and there are two churches. The suburb of Anjikaimal (so called in memory of five chiefs who at a distant period of history shared the surrounding country) contains a large and regularly-built market, and has a considerable trade, chiefly in the hands of the Jews and the Konk\u00e1n\u00eds.\n\nErni\u00e1l.\u2014Town in the Erni\u00e1l t\u00e1luk or Sub-division of Travancore State, Madras Presidency. Latitude 8\u00b0 12' 12\" N., longitude 77\u00b0 21' 31\" E. Population (1881) 18,420; houses, 4429. As the headquarters of the Sub-division, it possesses the usual subordinate native establishments. The London Missionary Society has a school here.\n\nErode (Irodu).\u2014T\u00e1luk of Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency. Bounded on the north by the Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed; on the north-east and east by the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery); and on the south by the Noyel river. The t\u00e1luk has an area of 599 square miles, and contains 1 town and 193 villages, with their hamlets. Houses, 45,427. Population (1881) 195,669, namely, 96,619 males and 99,050 females. Hindus number 192,148; Muhammadans, 2722; Christians, 783; and 'others,' 16. The occupied area is 302,590 acres, and the assessment about \u00a342,182. The land is chiefly 'dry' land, only 8882 acres being irrigated from channels and tanks. The chief source of irrigation is the Kalingarayan channel, led from an anicut at Bhav\u00e1n\u00ed, which traverses the eastern border for 57 miles; it irrigates 7283 acres, assessed at \u00a39820. There are a few rain-fed tanks and several thousand private irrigation wells. The cultivation under wells is good, and the soil fair; but the uplands are poor in soil and badly tilled. The fields are, however, almost universally hedged. The assessment averages 2s. 2d. per acre for 'dry,' and \u00a31, 3s. 7\u00bdd. for 'wet' lands. Eighty-three per cent. of the soil is red sand. There are no forests or hills, except three small ridges of very slight elevation. The population is chiefly agricultural and Hindu. Br\u00e1hmans are rarely found, except along the K\u00e1veri. The produce of the t\u00e1luk consists chiefly of cereals, pulses, oil-seeds, cotton (about 40,000 acres), chillies, tobacco, turmeric, jaggery, saltpetre, gunny, and coarse cloths; carts are largely made at Erode town, and building materials are cheap. Chief places are Erode town, Per\u00fandurai, Chennimalai, Kodum\u00fadi, and Arasal\u00far. The t\u00e1luk is well supplied with the means of communication; the trunk road from Madras passes through it, via Per\u00fandurai; and it has two railways\u2014the Madras and the South Indian lines\u2014which meet at Erode town. Weekly markets abound, those at Erode, Kunnatt\u00far, Per\u00fandurai, and Kanakap\u00faram being important. In 1883 there were 3 criminal courts and 1 civil; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 9; regular police, 81 men. The t\u00e1luk contains 3 post-offices, a fair number of schools, including a second-class middle school and a large municipal\nprimary school at Erode, and a municipal hospital. Arrack and toddy shops number 78 and 107 respectively. The taluk is hot but not unhealthy, and its rainfall is scanty.\n\n**Erode (Ir\u014ddu).**\u2014Town in Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency. Situated in latitude 11\u00b0 20' 29\" N., and longitude 77\u00b0 46' 3\" E., on the K\u0101veri (Cauvery) river, at the extreme east of the District, 243 miles by rail from Madras, 85 from Trichinopoli, 60 from Coimbatore, and 37 from Salem. Houses, 1886. Population (1881) 9864, of whom 8338 are Hindus, chiefly Vell\u0101lars, 1084 Muhammadans, 439 Christians, and 3 'others.' Being the head-quarters of the Erode taluk, it possesses the usual subordinate judicial establishments, police station, school, telegraph and post-office. It is now also the head-quarters of the District Sub-Collector, and is a municipality, with an income (1883) of \u00a31019, chiefly from house-tax and tolls. In the time of Haidar Al\u012b, Erode contained 3000 houses; but in consequence of successive Mar\u0101th\u0101, Mysore, and British invasions, the town became almost utterly deserted and ruined. As soon, however, as peace was signed, the people returned to a place with so many advantages in position and fertility; and within a year it had 400 houses, and a population of over 2000. The garrison was withdrawn in 1807, and the ruined fort levelled as a relief work during the famine of 1877. The space enclosed within the ramparts had been long before occupied by houses, with a cotton-press and saltpetre warehouse. The trade of Erode consists chiefly in the export of cotton, chillies, saltpetre, and rice; it is an important railway centre, and is rapidly rising in importance. Roads to Kar\u016br, Peran-durai, and Mysore\u2014one via the Hassan\u016br gh\u0101t, the other via the Barghar gh\u0101t\u2014radiate from it, serving as feeders to the railway, which has here a station at the junction of the Madras, South-Western, and South Indian lines. About 1\u00bd miles east of the town a girder bridge of 22 arches crosses the K\u0101veri, 1536 feet in length, constructed at a cost of \u00a340,875. The town is well built, and besides other public edifices has a good court-house and sub-jail, erected at a cost of \u00a33000.\n\n**Eruv\u0101di.**\u2014Town in Tinnevelli District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 5171, namely, Hindus, 2416; Muhammadans, 2522; and Christians, 233.\n\n**Etah.**\u2014British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces, lying between 27\u00b0 19' 42\" and 28\u00b0 1' 39\" N. lat., and 78\u00b0 27' 26\" and 79\u00b0 19' 23\" E. long. Etah is the northernmost District of the Agra Division. It is bounded on the north by the river Ganges, separating it from Bud\u0101un District; on the west by Al\u012bgarh and Agra; on the south by M\u0101inpuri; and on the east by Farukh\u0101b\u0101d. Area, 1738 square miles; population (1881) 756,523. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Etah, but Kasganj is the chief centre of population and commerce.\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Etah lies on the eastern edge of the middle Do\u00e1b, where the elevated plateau composing that fertile tract dips into the valley of the Ganges. From the banks of the great river to the terraces which form the escarpment of the upland plain stretches a belt of level land known as the tar\u00e1i; bounded on the west by the B\u00farh Gang\u00e1, or ancient bed of the river. The abandoned channel is still marked by a line of swamps and hollows, which receive the surface drainage of the neighbouring fields. The whole tar\u00e1i, lying between the former and the present stream of the river, is covered with a rich alluvial deposit, and abundantly supplied with water, so that artificial irrigation is unnecessary. But in its widest portion, the crust of alluvial matter becomes thinner, and sandy undulating downs begin to crop up. Above the marshy bed of the B\u00farh Gang\u00e1 rises the old high bank of the ancient channel, which leads at once to the central Do\u00e1b plateau. This upland tract exhibits the same natural characteristics in Etah as elsewhere, being for the most part a level plain, interspersed with hillocks of yellow sand and patches of rich loam, which latter are generally chosen as village sites; but it is neither so fertile nor so highly cultivated as in the Meerut (Merath) Division to the north, owing to the want of irrigation. The Lower Ganges Canal, however, recently completed, will, it is hoped, supply all the needs of Etah; and the District may be expected before long to rival the fertility of Al\u00edgarh and Bulandshahr. The central plateau is bounded to the west by the deep gorge of the K\u00e1l\u00ed N\u00e1di, a tributary of the Ganges, which provides Etah with a main drainage channel, and, occasionally overflowing its banks after heavy rain, fertilizes the fallow land with a rich layer of fine silt and decaying vegetable matter. The angle to the south-west of the K\u00e1l\u00ed is by far the most fruitful portion of the District. Naturally composed of a strong and rich clay, it is intersected by the Cawnpur and Et\u00e1wah branches of the Ganges Canal, which supply water to the fields by 138 miles of distributary streams. It is much cut up, however, by wide stretches of \u00fasar plain, which are absolutely barren of all vegetation. Indeed, the whole District is distinguished for its bare and treeless appearance. The larger villages and towns are surrounded with pleasant groves, but there are few woods of any extent, and very little jungle-land. Over one-third of the area is returned as uncultivated, of which one-half is cultivable, and that will doubtless be reclaimed as soon as the irrigation schemes now on foot are completed. The remainder consists either of dry saline \u00fasar plain or barren flats of bh\u00edr waste. As a whole, while Etah cannot boast of such advantages as the Districts which lie above it in the Do\u00e1b, it is more flourishing than the majority of its neighbours to the south and west.\n\nHistory.\u2014Tradition points to the valley of the K\u00e1l\u00ed as the seat of\npopulous cities in mythical times; and the accounts of the Buddhist pilgrims from China, in the 5th and 7th centuries A.D., bear out to some extent the legendary statements. The District was at that time rich in temples and monasteries, as befitted a place which had been honoured by the personal presence of Buddha, many incidents in whose life are connected with the ruined mounds of Atranji. From the 6th to the 10th century, Etah appears to have been held by Ahirs and Bhars, and then to have been occupied by the Rajputs, during the course of their great immigration eastwards. When Mahmud of Ghazni marched against the kingdom of Kanauj in 1017, he must have taken Etah on his route; and the District must again have been traversed nearly two centuries later by the army of the second great Musalm\u00e1n conqueror, Muhammad Ghori, on its way to the final battle with the Rahtor Raja, Jai Chand, in the Jumna ravines of Agra. From that time forward, Etah remained a dependency of the Musalm\u00e1n rulers at Kanauj or Koil, and never again fell into the hands of a Hindu prince. But the District was then a wild expanse of dh\u00e1k forest, studded with the mud forts of robber chieftains and the villages of a lawless peasantry, and such it remained until the introduction of British rule. Patiali, the then principal town, lying on the old channel of the Ganges, was infested by robber hordes whose misdeeds roused the indignation of Sult\u00e1n Balban, about the year 1270. The Sult\u00e1n proceeded in person to Patiali, and opened the roads to Hindust\u00e1n for merchants and caravans by placing strong garrisons in the fortresses of the banditti, so that 'Musalm\u00e1ns and guardians of the way took the place of highway robbers.' The principal Muhammadan inhabitants still trace the origin of their families to this period. During the frequent Musalm\u00e1n invasions of the 15th century, Etah was constantly exposed to the ravages of both parties, as it lay on the direct route to the great cities on the Ganges. Akbar included it in his sark\u00e1rs of Kanauj, Koil, and Bud\u00e1un, and used it as an outpost against the refractory Hindus of Mainpuri. At the end of the last century, Etah passed into the hands of the Naw\u00e1b Waz\u00edr of Oudh, and formed a portion of the territory ceded to the British in 1801-2. It was then distributed among the adjoining Districts of Etawah, Farukhabad, Aligarh, and Moradabad. The outlying pargan\u00e1s which compose the present District were from the first so remote from the central authority that it was found necessary in 1811 to place a subordinate European officer at Patiali, with criminal jurisdiction over the surrounding country. After many changes of an intricate sort, the condition of the pargan\u00e1s around Etah attracted serious consideration in 1845. The Ahirs and Aheriyas carried on a system of organized plunder; and dak\u00e1itis (gang-robberies), planned by an outlaw from the Jumna ravines of Mainpuri, became so frequent as to call\nfor more efficient police arrangements. Much of the country was still covered with dh\u00e1k jungle, and studded with mud forts, moated and fenced on every side. The landowners even considered it a mark of disrespect to call for the revenue without some show of force to back up their demand. Accordingly, a Deputy Collector and Joint Magistrate was stationed at Pati\u00e1li in 1845; and in 1856 the head-quarters were transferred to a more accessible position at Etah, a village on the Grand Trunk Road, from which the District takes its name. The succeeding year saw the outbreak at Meerut (Merath), which quickly developed into the Mutiny of 1857. As soon as the troops garrisoned at Etah received intelligence of the revolt at Al\u00edgarh, the whole body left the station without any disturbance. As there was no place of strength in the town, and no force with which to defend it, the Magistrate found it necessary to withdraw until the mutineers from M\u00e1n\u00edpur\u00ed and Et\u00e1wah had passed through. After a gallant but unsuccessful attempt to hold K\u00e1sganj, the whole District was abandoned on the 7th of June, and the officers reached Agra in safety. Damar Singh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Etah, then set himself up as an independent ruler in the south of the District. As usual, however, rival claimants appeared in various quarters; and towards the end of July, the rebel Naw\u00e1b of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d took practical possession of the country for some months. On the approach of General Greathed\u2019s column, the rebels retired for a while, and Mr. Cocks was appointed Special Commissioner for Etah and Aligarh. The force at his disposal, however, was quite insufficient to restore order, and the rebels still continued to hold K\u00e1sganj. It was not till the 15th of December that Colonel Seaton\u2019s column attacked the rebels at Gang\u00edri, and, after totally routing them, occupied K\u00e1sganj. By the middle of 1858, order was completely restored, and the peace of the District has not since been disturbed.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The population of Etah District in 1865 (then a smaller area than at present), according to the Census of that year, was returned at 614,351; in 1872 it was 703,527 on the then area, or 829,118 on the present area of the District. Since 1872 the population shows a considerable decrease, being returned in 1881 at 756,523, being 72,595, or 8\u00b77 per cent., less than the number living on the same area nine years previously. This decrease is partially due to the scarcity and sickness which prevailed in 1878\u201379; but there appears little doubt that the population of Etah and the surrounding Districts, if not of the Provinces in general, has reached the stationary stage. The results arrived at by the Census of 1881 may be briefly summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 1739 square miles; number of towns and villages, 1489; houses, 88,543; total population, 756,523, namely, males 413,689, and females 342,834. These figures yield the following averages:\u2014Proportion of males in total population, 54\u00b75 per cent.;\naverage density of population, 435 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 0.85; persons per village, 508; houses per square mile, 50.9; persons per house, 8.5. As regards the religious distinctions of the people, Etah is one of the most thoroughly Hindu Districts in the Do\u00e1b. The Hindus in 1881 numbered 674,463, or 89.9 per cent. of the whole population; and the Muhammadans, 76,774, or 10.1 per cent., the remainder consisting of 5152 Jains, 16 Sikhs, 117 Christians, and 1 Jew. Of the four great classes into which the Hindus are conventionally divided, the Br\u00e1hmans number 62,065 persons. They own a large portion of the District as zamind\u00e1rs, and most of them belong to the ancient Kanaujiya sub-division. The R\u00e1jputs are exceptionally numerous in Etah, being returned at 67,371. They are by far the most important landowning class in the District, and include many of the great territorial families. The Baniy\u00e1s or trading castes are represented by 27,632 persons; they are a wealthy mercantile body, and own a considerable proportion of the land. The great mass of the Hindi population here, as elsewhere, belong to the lower castes of the Census returns. The Cham\u00e1rs or despised skinners and leather-dressers are their most numerous tribe, forming the landless labouring class throughout the whole Do\u00e1b, where they have only just emerged under British rule from a state of rural serfdom. Number in 1881, 97,120. Next come the Ah\u00edrs (77,819), once the dominant race, and still the possessors of a large number of villages. The K\u00e1yasths, the first of the S\u00fadra castes in social rank, are wealthy landholders, and numbered 9640 in 1881. The two great cultivating castes are the Lodh\u00eds, 72,549; and the Kachh\u00eds, 72,258 in number. The other Hindu castes numbering upwards of 10,000 in 1881 were the following\u2014Gad\u00e1riy\u00e1s, 28,860; Kah\u00e1rs, 22,988; Barh\u00e1is, 15,765; Nais, 14,281; Kor\u00eds, 14,150; Bhang\u00eds, 13,426; Dhob\u00eds, 11,919; Kumbh\u00e1rs, 10,983; and Tel\u00eds, 10,679. The Musalm\u00e1ns (76,774) still retain much of their landed possessions, and all, with the exception of 395, belong to the Sunni sect. Among the Muhammadans are included 409 R\u00e1jputs and 417 Mewatis by race. The Christian population included 36 Europeans, 51 Eurasians, 1 Armenian, and 29 native converts.\n\nDistribution of the People into Town and Country.\u2014About two-thirds of the adult male population are dependent upon the soil for their support, the District being strictly agricultural, and the population almost entirely rural. In 1881 there were 7 towns with a population exceeding 5000 persons, namely, Etah, 8054; Kasganj, 16,535; Jalesar, 15,609; Soron, 12,745; Marahra, 9271; Aliganj, 7436; and Awah, 5679. Total urban population, 75,329, leaving 681,194 as representing the rural population. Of the 1489 villages and towns, 459 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 606 from two to five hundred; 295 from five hundred to a thousand; 98 from\none to two thousand; 13 from two to three thousand; 11 from three to five thousand; 4 from five to ten thousand; and 3 upwards of ten thousand inhabitants. As regards occupation, the Census Report divides the male population into six main classes as follows:\u2014Class (1) Professional, including the civil, military, and learned professions, 7531; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 1268; (3) commercial, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 8226; (4) agricultural, including cultivators, gardeners, sheep and cattle tenders, etc., 196,507; (5) industrial, including manufacturers and artisans, 47,365; (6) indefinite and non-productive (comprising 19,681 general labourers, and 133,111 male children or persons of indefinite occupation), 152,792. The ordinary language of the people is Hindi.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The principal crops grown in the District are wheat and other cereals, millets and pulses, cotton, sugar-cane, indigo, and poppy; the harvests are the usual kharif and rabi, the former being the more important of the two. Of a total area of 1,112,829 acres in 1881\u201382, more than one-half, or 683,537 acres, were under cultivation; 206,773 acres cultivable waste; 9259 acres of grazing land; and 213,260 acres barren and uncultivable waste. The area occupied by the principal crops was distributed as follows:\u2014Wheat, 129,900 acres; barley, 60,424 acres; indigo, 20,002 acres; cotton, 42,958 acres; sugar-cane, 15,158 acres; jo\u00e1r, 103,838 acres; bajra, 131,588 acres; Indian corn, 33,720 acres; and rice, 14,093 acres. The average out-turn of an acre of wheat is 13 maunds, or a little over 9 cwts., valued at \u00a33. The employment of manure is almost universal, though a single application is expected to suffice for two successive harvests. As a rule, only one crop a year is raised on each plot, but cotton is often succeeded by tobacco or vegetables, and indigo by wheat or barley. Rotation of crops is rapidly supplanting the old wasteful habit of leaving the lands to lie fallow after exhausting products have been grown. Irrigation is extensively practised from wells and canals, though it has not kept pace with other agricultural improvements. The total area irrigated in 1881 was 263,197 acres, of which 183,293 acres were irrigated by private enterprise from wells, tanks, etc., and 79,944 acres from Government works. The recent completion of the Lower Ganges Canal, however, will doubtless effect an immense extension in the Government irrigated area. The area under sugar-cane has decreased in recent years, except where an abundant water-supply can be obtained from the canals which intersect the south-western corner of the District; but all the other export staples have been grown in larger quantities, while no corresponding diminution has taken place in the area devoted to food-stuffs. The cultivators are in comfortable circumstances, less wealthy than their neighbours\nin the Meerut Division, but removed far above the squalid poverty of Bundelkhand. Temples and mosques are rare in Etah, a mound of earth being often the only place of worship in a village; while in Aligarh, beyond the northern boundary, handsome buildings for religious purposes are to be seen on every side. Cultivators with rights of occupancy hold 64 per cent. of the cultivated area, and tenants-at-will 21 per cent., while the remaining 15 per cent. is occupied by small proprietors who farm their own land. Rents are unusually low, chiefly owing to the jealous care with which Government has guarded the rights of hereditary tenants, and resisted all attempts at illegal enhancement. The average rates vary from 2s. 9d. to 7s. 1d. per acre, according to crop. The male adult agriculturists in 1881 numbered 194,399, cultivating an average of 3'54 acres each. The total population, however, dependent on the soil is returned at 511,519, or 67'6 per cent. of the entire District population. Of the total area of the District, 24'5 square miles are held revenue-free, leaving 1714 square miles assessed for Government revenue. Total land revenue in 1881, including cesses and local rates levied on the land, \u00a3140,595, or an average of 4s. 1\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total rental paid by cultivators, \u00a3241,965, or an average of 7s. per cultivated acre.\n\nWages ordinarily rule as follows:\u2014Carpenters, masons, and blacksmiths, 6d. per diem; tailors, 4\u00bdd. per diem; coolies, water-carriers, etc., 3d. per diem. Agricultural labourers are generally paid in kind; when paid in cash, men get 3d., women 1\u00bdd., and children 3\u00bdd. per diem. Prices have risen steadily during the last thirty years. The average of ten years, ending in 1870, shows the following rates at K\u00e1sganj:\u2014Wheat or gram, 22 sers per rupee, or 5s. 1d. per cwt.; barley or jo\u00e1r, 28 sers per rupee, or 4s. per cwt.; b\u00e1jra, 27 sers per rupee, or 4s. 1\u00bed. per cwt. Prices at Etah town ruled about 1 ser per rupee dearer than these quotations. The average rates in 1883 were as follow:\u2014Wheat, 19\u00bd sers per rupee, or 5s. 9d. per cwt.; barley, 24\u00bd sers per rupee, or 4s. 7d. per cwt.; common rice, 14\u00bd sers per rupee, or 7s. 9d. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 22\u00bd sers per rupee, or 4s. 11d. per cwt.; b\u00e1jra, 22\u00bd sers per rupee, or 4s. 11d. per cwt.; gram, 23\u00bd sers per rupee, or 4s. 9d. per cwt. Jo\u00e1r and b\u00e1jra form the ordinary food-grains of the population.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Etah suffers from the ravages of locusts, white ants, and other destructive insects; and the cereal crops are liable to several kinds of blight. Floods also occasionally occur in the low-lying valley of the Ganges, and overwhelm the fertile soil with ridges of barren shingle. But the great enemy of Etah, as of all the Do\u00e1b, is drought, which has frequently produced severe famines. The last was that of 1860\u201361, known among the peasantry by the graphic title of the \u2018Seven-ser famine,\u2019 in which rice sold at the rate of 7 sers per\nrupee, or 7 lbs. for a shilling. The people were forced to live upon wild fruits and vegetables, and even to extract food from grass seeds. The drought of 1868\u201369, however, was felt in Etah much less severely than in neighbouring Districts. Though both harvests were partial failures, the scarcity which ensued did not rise to the intensity of famine, and the highest quotation for wheat was only 13 sers per rupee, or 8s. 7\u00bdd. per cwt. Famine rates are reached in this District when wheat sells at less than 12 sers per rupee, or more than 9s. 4d. per cwt. But it is hoped that the Lower Ganges Canal, recently completed, will secure the District in future from the extremity of famine.\n\nCommerce, Trade, etc.\u2014Etah has a considerable export trade in agricultural produce. In an average season the surplus for exportation is estimated to amount to the following quantities:\u2014Rice, 100,000 maunds, or 73,469 cwts.; cleaned cotton, 46,909 maunds, or 34,463 cwts.; uncleaned cotton, 140,727 maunds, or 103,391 cwts.; wheat and barley, 1,831,725 maunds, or 1,345,757 cwts., besides a large quantity of pulses and millets. The only important manufacture is that of indigo, which is carried on in about 200 factories, some of them under European management. Sugar is refined to a large extent in the northern part of the District; and the pargan\u00e1s lying on the banks of the Ganges and the B\u00farh Gang\u00e1 prepare salt from the saline earth which is common everywhere. Ropes and coarse sacking are also made from the hemp of the country, and exported as far as Calcutta. Before the Mutiny, firearms of finished workmanship and elaborately inlaid with silver were manufactured in the District; but since the Disarming Act this trade has greatly declined. A religious fair is held once a year at Soron, when the Hindus bathe in the purifying waters of the B\u00farh Gang\u00e1, and lay in their annual stock of clothing and household utensils. Another fair is held at Kakora in Bud\u00e1un District, just opposite the village of K\u00e1dirganj in Etah; and although the traders congregate chiefly on the Bud\u00e1un bank, many pilgrims, whose object is purely religious, bathe and remain at K\u00e1dirganj. No railway passes through the District, but a good metalled road connects the headquarters at Etah with the Shikoh\u00e1b\u00e1d station on the East Indian line, 35 miles distant. There are altogether 541 miles of first, second, and third-class roads in the District. The last class are being raised and bridged in portions from year to year. The Ganges is navigable throughout the District, and the exports of K\u00e1sganj and Dundw\u00e1raganj are shipped at the gh\u00e1ts of the same name. Some small traffic also passes by the Cawnpur branch of the Canal. In 1881 there were two printing-presses in the District, owned by natives at Etah, provided both with N\u00e1gari and Persian type.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1860\u201361, the total revenue of the District from all sources amounted to \u00a388,867, of which \u00a373,743 was derived from\nthe land-tax; while the total expenditure amounted to \u00a323,680, or hardly more than one-fourth of the revenue. In 1870-71, the total receipts had increased to \u00a3119,399, while the land-tax had remained almost stationary at \u00a378,852. The increase was mainly due to canal collections, and to a large rise in the proceeds of local cesses, the income-tax, and the items of stamps and octroi. At the same time, the expenditure had risen to \u00a337,272, or nearly one-third of the revenue. This increase was due to the need for more active administration, and was chiefly set down to such items as salaries of officials, education, post-office, canals, medical staff, and local cesses. In 1882-83, after the transfer of Jalesar tahsil from Agra District to Etah in 1879, the gross District revenue amounted to \u00a3135,788, of which \u00a3119,521 was derived from the land. In the same year, the District was administered by 2 covenanted civilians, and contained 11 magisterial, 2 civil, and 9 revenue courts. The police consisted in 1883 of 350 regular and 262 municipal and town police, maintained at a cost of \u00a35923, of which \u00a34467 was paid from provincial funds, and \u00a31456 from local sources. This force was supplemented by 1469 village watchmen (chaukidars) and 66 road patrols, maintained at a cost of \u00a35565. The whole machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property consisted of 2043 officers and men, or 1 policeman to every 0.81 square mile and every 370 inhabitants; and the total cost of their maintenance was \u00a311,488, or about 3\u00bdd. per head of the population. The District has but one jail, the average daily number of prisoners in which was 117 in 1860, 210 in 1870, and 257 in 1882. Education is making a slow but steady advance in Etah; it is gaining in popular estimation, and some of the village schools are said to be models of excellence. In 1870-71, the District contained 166 Government-inspected schools, with a total of 3953 pupils. By March 1883, although the number of such inspected schools had fallen to 149, the number of pupils had increased to 4586. There are also a number of private schools uninspected by the educational officers; and the Census Report of 1881 returns 5499 boys and 111 girls as under instruction, besides 15,731 males and 230 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. The District is divided into 4 tahsils and 13 parganas, with an aggregate, in 1882, of 1856 estates. It contains 6 municipalities\u2014K\u00e1sganj, Jalesar, Etah, Soron, Marehra, and Aliganj. In 1882-83 their joint income amounted to \u00a35073, of which \u00a34317 was derived from octroi; expenditure, \u00a37263.\n\nSanitary Aspects.\u2014The climate of Etah is dry and healthy, but sand and dust storms are of almost daily occurrence in the hot season. During the cooler months the air is cold and bracing, and fires are often found necessary, especially in the winter rains. The total rainfall was 44.7 inches in 1867-68, 12.9 inches in 1868-69 (a year of scarcity),\n27\u00b73 inches in 1869-70, 34\u00b71 inches in 1870-71, 36\u00b71 inches in 1880-81, and 34\u00b76 inches in 1881-82. The principal diseases are fevers and small-pox, but cholera sometimes visits Etah with severity. The reported death-rate was 22 per 1000 in 1872, 24\u00b72 per 1000 in 1873, 22\u00b71 per 1000 in 1874, and 29\u00b75 per 1000 in 1882. In the latter year, the total number of deaths recorded was 21,554, of which as many as 19,204 were due to fever alone. There are 7 charitable dispensaries in the District, of which 2 are supported by endowments, which afforded assistance in 1883 to 35,902 out-door and 887 in-door patients.

Area, 491 square miles, of which 276 are cultivated. Population (1881) 226,892, namely, Hindus, 207,624; Muhammadans, 17,021; Jains, 2191; and \u2018others,\u2019 56. Number of towns and villages, 470. Land revenue, \u00a335,863; total Government revenue, \u00a340,256; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a357,231; incidence of Government revenue per acre, 2s. 0\u00bdd.\n\n**Etah.**\u2014Town, municipality, and administrative head-quarters of Etah District, North-Western Provinces. Situated in lat. 27\u00b0 33' 50\" N., and long 78\u00b0 42' 25\" E., on the Grand Trunk Road, 9 miles west of the K\u00e1li Nadi. Population (1881) 8054, namely, Hindus, 5211; Muhammadans, 2311; Jains, 492; Christians, 31; \u2018others,\u2019 9; area of town site, 230 acres. Municipal income in 1882-83, \u00a31047, of which \u00a3717 was derived from octroi, and the balance from miscellaneous fees and fines; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 9\u00bdd. per head. Etah is rather an overgrown village than a town, deriving its whole importance from the presence of the civil station, removed hither from Pati\u00e1li in 1856, on account of the superior accessibility of the site. The principal market-place, Mayneganj, perpetuates the name of Mr. F. O. Mayne, C.B., a former Collector of the District. Westward lies the new town of Etah, containing the tahsil\u00ed school, while to the east R\u00e1j\u00e1 Dilsugh R\u00e1\u00ed's temple towers over the other buildings to an extraordinary height. Large tank with handsome flight of steps, municipal hall, court-house, tahsil\u00ed office, dispensary. The site is low, and was formerly subject to floods; but a cutting to the Isan Nadi, effected by Mr. Mayne, has remedied this evil. In the town itself mud houses predominate, but most of the streets are metalled and drained. The residences of\nthe officials are few and scattered. Founded about 500 years since by Sangr\u00e1m Singh, a Chauh\u00e1n Th\u00e1kur, whose mud fort still exists to the north of the town. His descendants occupied the surrounding territory, with the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1, till the Mutiny, when R\u00e1j\u00e1 Damar Singh rebelled, and lost his property, together with the family honours. (See Etah District.) Chief trade\u2014the scarlet \u00e1l dye, indigo-seed, cotton, and sugar. Market twice a week, on Monday and Friday.\n\n**Etaiyapuram.**\u2014Town in Tinneveli District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 5167, namely, Hindus, 4831; Muhammadans, 320; and Christians, 16.\n\n**Etawah.**\u2014British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces, lying between $26^\\circ 21' 8\"$ and $27^\\circ 0' 25\"$ N. lat., and between $78^\\circ 47' 20\"$ and $79^\\circ 47' 20\"$ E. long. Etawah is a District of the Agra Division. It is bounded on the north by Mainpuri and Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d; on the west by the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1) river and Agra District, the Chambal, the Ku\u00e1ri Nadi, and the Native State of Gwalior; on the south by the Jumna; and on the east by Cawnpur. Area (1881) 1693 square miles; population, 722,371 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Etawah, which is the only place of importance in the District.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The District of Etawah is a purely artificial division for administrative purposes, stretching from the level plain of the Do\u00e1b, across the valley of the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1), to the gorges and ravines of the Chambal, which form the last outliers of the Vindhyan range. It exhibits an unusual variety of scenery. The north-eastern portion of the District, known as the pach\u00e1r, which is separated from the remainder by the deep and fissured bed of the river Seng\u00e1r, belongs in its physical features to the great upland plateau of the Do\u00e1b. This tract consists of a fertile loam, occasionally interrupted by barren \u00fasar plains, and interspersed with saucer-like depressions of clay, whose centre is occupied by marshes or shallow lakes. It is well watered, both by the streams which take their rise from these swampy hollows, and by the great artificial canals which intersect and fertilize the Upper and Central Do\u00e1b. The Cawnpur branch canal, though it does not enter the District, runs close to its borders, and sends off distributaries which supply the extreme eastern angle; the Etawah branch traverses the centre of the plateau; while the Bhogn\u00edpur division of the Lower Ganges Canal, recently completed, passes between the two older works, and irrigates the intervening country. The whole pach\u00e1r is rich and fertile, and it is clothed in the season with a green expanse of wheat and sugar-cane.\n\nOn the opposite bank of the Seng\u00e1r lies another stretch of uplands, reaching almost to the bed of the Jumna. This tract,\nlocally known as the garh, is not unlike the pach\u00e1r in its physical characteristics; but as water can only be obtained at a great depth in wells, cotton and inferior food-grains here replace the more valuable crops for which abundant irrigation is necessary. The Bhognipur canal, however, now passes through the very heart of this region, whose natural fertility was always considerable. The uplands descend into the Jumna valley through a wild terraced slope, broken by ravines, and covered with thorny brushwood. Upon its sides the villages are scanty, and lie concealed in the remotest nooks, while cultivation is difficult and unprofitable. Below, the river bank is sometimes fringed by a strip of rich alluvial deposit; but in other places the Jumna sweeps close round the bold bluffs which terminate the upland terraces. Its bank should form the natural boundary of the District, but a narrow strip of British territory lies along its opposite side, cut off from the Native State of Gwalior by the rapid torrents of the Chambal and the Ku\u00e1ri N\u00e1di. This outlying region has been attached to Et\u00e1wah for administrative purposes. A little alluvial soil is found here and there on small plots of table-land in the trans-Jumna tract; but the greater part consists of a perfect labyrinth of gorges, amongst whose recesses may be found some of the wildest and most romantic scenery in Upper India. From the fortress-crowned cliff of Bhareh the eye wanders over a tangled mass of rock and valley, threaded by eddying rivers, overgrown with leafy jungle of acacia or oleander, and studded on every prominent bluff with the ruined stronghold of some ancient robber chief. The rugged and picturesque nature of this intricate range, known as the P\u00e1nchnada, or Country of Five Rivers, contrasts strangely with the cultivated and monotonous level of the Do\u00e1b to the east.\n\nEt\u00e1wah is well watered, both naturally and artificially. The rivers of the District, proceeding from east to west, are the following:\u2014(1) The Pandu rises in the extreme north-east corner of the District, in a great clay depression forming a large jhil or marsh, and flows south-eastwards into Cawnpur District, ultimately joining the Ganges. This channel attains to no size in Et\u00e1wah, and is dry except in the rainy season. (2) The Rind or Arind rises in Aligarh, touches on Et\u00e1wah near the village of Bh\u00e1u Khera, runs eastwards along the northern boundary as far as the large village of Sabhad, when it turns to the south until it receives the united waters of two small tributaries, the Puraha and Ahneya, after which it flows south-east into Cawnpur District. The Rind is a perennial stream, but very shallow in the dry season. Its banks are mostly formed of alluvial soil. The tributary streams entirely dry up in the hot and cold seasons, being mere drainage channels for carrying off superfluous rain-water. (3) The Sengar N\u00e1di, said to derive its name from the Sengar clan of Th\u00e1kurs who live along its\nbanks, enters the District from the north-west, and flows in a south-easterly direction till it enters Cawnpur District. In the upper part of its course the stream is not of much importance, and the banks are generally cultivable; but about four miles above Etawah town it is joined by a smaller stream, the Sarsa, which has previously flowed almost parallel to it. Thenceforward the Sengar runs in a deep bed, and the drainage from the surrounding country furrows its banks into deep ravines, altogether unfit for cultivation. They are, however, in places useful for pasturage, and produce babul and riunj trees, which are utilized for timber. (4) The Jumna first touches on the north-western extremity of the District, and, flowing in a south-easterly direction, either bounds or traverses it for 115 miles. During the rainy season this river is navigable by boats of heavy burthen, though the windings of its channel render it by no means a direct line for traffic, and reefs of limestone and sand conglomerate jut out into the stream, and frequently render navigation both difficult and dangerous. The traffic is small, and hardly averages more than two boats up and down every day. The bank on one side is usually steep and precipitous, and on the other low and open to the overflow of the river in the rains. The river consequently spreads out widely in time of flood, and its surface velocity being small, it covers a large area in the rains with a rich alluvial deposit. Numerous ferries are maintained across the Jumna on the principal lines of traffic. (5) The Chambal runs in a direction almost parallel with the Jumna. It forms the south-western frontier of Etawah for about 25 miles, after which it continues its course through the District, and eventually joins the Jumna at Bhareh. In appearance and character, the Chambal in this part of its course closely resembles the Jumna, and has a channel of equal dimensions. It is exceedingly liable to sudden and heavy floods, when from the superior velocity of its current it discharges a greater volume of water than the Jumna. During heavy flood, communication is almost entirely cut off between the two banks. It is crossed by four principal ferries. The waters of the Chambal are as clear as crystal; and for some distance after its junction with the Jumna, its stream may be distinguished from that of the latter, which always carries either sand or mud in suspension. (6) The only other river of importance is the Kuari, which also marks a portion of the south-western boundary of the District, or traverses it for a distance of about 20 miles, when it unites with the Jumna and Chambal just below their junction. It is of the same class and character as those rivers, and subject to great and sudden floods in the rains, though very often dry in the hot season. The characteristic of the tract lying around the confluence of these rivers is the tangled mass of ravines which lie on either side of their channels. The whole of it is so deeply furrowed, that only a little\nmore than a quarter of the area is under cultivation. The canals by which the District is watered artificially have been alluded to in the previous paragraph.\n\nEtawah in general is well wooded, except in the \u00fasar tracts. There are no jungles of any size, but the remains of a broad wooded belt, now containing little but dh\u00e1k trees (Butea frondosa), runs in a south-easterly direction through the pach\u00e1r tract. This jungle was once of considerable size, but all the cultivable parts of it are now being brought under the plough. The \u00fasar plains in the Do\u00e1b and the ravines along the courses of the larger rivers occupy a considerable portion of the area of the District, and detract much from its general productiveness. The village communities who inhabit these tracts have done all that industry could do to utilize the existing patches of good land. Where the ravines are wide enough, they have been dammed across so as to stop the rush of water and preserve the good soil. The sides, too, have been carefully terraced. The portions which could not be so worked are of value for pasturage, or as producing firewood; and the people derive a livelihood from grazing cattle, and by the sale of ghi. The other uncultivated land is, as a rule, bad land, impregnated to a greater or less extent with the saline efflorescence reh. There are no mines or stone quarries in the District, but kankar or calcareous limestone is procurable in quantities from the ravines, which is either ground into lime, or used in its raw state as road-metalling. The principal wild beasts found in the District are the following:\u2014Leopard, wolf, jackal, nilg\u00e1i, antelope, wild hog, porcupine, badger, etc. Game birds are plentiful; and the rivers and tanks abound with fish, crocodiles, porpoises, and turtles, which sometimes grow to an enormous size. Venomous snakes, particularly the cobra and karail, are common.\n\nHistory.\u2014The physical features of Etawah, which rendered it practically inaccessible to invaders in early times, marked it out for many ages as a secure retreat for the lawless and turbulent. Numerous mounds still show the ancient sites of prehistoric forts throughout the District, which long formed a main stronghold of the Meos, the Ishmaelites of the Upper Do\u00e1b. In their hands it doubtless remained until after the earliest Muhammadan invasions, as none of the tribes now inhabiting its borders has any traditions which stretch back beyond the 12th century of our era. Etawah was probably traversed both by Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed and by Kutab-ud-d\u00edn, on their successful expeditions against the native dynasties; but the memorials of these events are indistinct and uncertain on all local details. It is clear, however, that the Hindus of Etawah succeeded on the whole in maintaining their independence against the Musalm\u00e1n aggressors; for while the neighbouring Districts have a number of wealthy and influential Muham-\nmadan colonies, only a thin sprinkling of Shaikhs or Sayyids can be found amongst the territorial families of Et\u00e1wah. The R\u00e1jputs seem to have occupied the District in the course of their great eastward migration during the 12th century, and they were shortly followed by the Kanaujiya Br\u00e1hmans, whose descendants still form the most important element of the landowning community. Musalm\u00e1n histories teem with notices of raids conducted with varying success by the Sayyid generals against the 'accursed infidels' of Et\u00e1wah. The Hindu chiefs were generally able to defend their country from the invaders, though they made peace after each raid by the payment of a precarious tribute. Early in the 16th century, B\u00e1bar conquered the District, together with the rest of the Do\u00e1b; and it remained in the power of the Mugh\u00e1ls until the expulsion of Hum\u00e1y\u00fan. His Afgh\u00e1n rival, Sher Sh\u00e1h, saw that no order could be established without a thorough system of internal communications; and he opened up the country with roads and watch-houses, besides stationing 12,000 horsemen in Hathk\u00e1ut, who dealt out such rude but prompt measures of justice as suited the circumstances of the place and the people. His reforms laid the foundation for the imperial organization of the Mughal dynasty. Akbar included Et\u00e1wah in his sark\u00e1rs of Agra, Kanauj, K\u00e1lpi, and Ir\u00edch. But even that great administrator failed thoroughly to incorporate Et\u00e1wah with the dominions of the Delhi court. Neither as proselytizers nor as settlers have the Musalm\u00e1ns impressed their mark so deeply here as in other Districts of the Do\u00e1b. During the decline of the Mughal power, Et\u00e1wah fell at first into the grasping hands of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The battle of P\u00e1n\u00edpat dispossessed them for a while, and the District became an appanage of the J\u00e1t garrison at Agra. In 1770, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s returned, and for three years they occupied the Do\u00e1b afresh. But when, in 1773, Najaf Kh\u00e1n drove the intruders southward, the Naw\u00e1b Waz\u00edr of Oudh crossed the Ganges, and laid claim to his share of the spoil. During the anarchic struggle which closed the century, Et\u00e1wah fell sometimes into the hands of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and sometimes into those of the Waz\u00edr; but at last the power of Oudh became firmly established, and was not questioned until the cession to the East India Company in 1801. Even after the British took possession, many of the District chiefs maintained a position of independence, or at least of insubordination; and it was some time before the revenue officers ventured to approach them with a demand for the Government dues. Gradually, however, the turbulent landowners were reduced to obedience, and industrial organization took the place of the old predatory r\u00e9gime. The murderous practice of thaggi (thuggee) had been common before the cession, but was firmly repressed by the new power. In spite of a devastating famine in 1837, which revolutionized the proprietary system by dis-\nmembering the great taluks or fiscal farms, the District steadily improved for many years, under the influence of settled government. The opening of the Ganges Canal, with its constantly increasing branches, diffused fertility through a wide portion of the area; and every class of the community was advancing in material prosperity, while the opening of schools gave an earnest of future advancement.\n\nThe Mutiny of 1857 interrupted for some months this progress. News of the outbreak at Meerut (Merath) reached Etawah two days after its occurrence. Within the week, a small body of mutineers passed through the District, and fired upon the authorities, upon which they were surrounded and cut down. Shortly after, another body occupied Jaswantnagar, and, although a gallant attack was made upon them by the local officials, they succeeded in holding the town. On the 22nd of May, it was thought desirable to withdraw from Etawah station, but the troops mutinied on their march, and it was with difficulty that the officers and ladies reached Barhpura. There they were joined by the 1st Gwalior Regiment, which, however, itself proved insubordinate upon the 17th of June. It then became necessary to abandon the District and retire to Agra. The Jhansi mutineers immediately occupied Etawah, and soon passed on to Mainpuri. Meanwhile, many of the native officials proved themselves steady friends of order, and communicated whenever it was possible with the Magistrate in Agra. Bands of rebels from different quarters passed through between July and December, until on Christmas-day Brigadier Walpole\u2019s column re-entered the District. Etawah station was recovered on the 6th January 1858; but the rebels still held the Shergarh gh\u00e1t, on the main road to Bundelkhand, and the whole south-west of the District remained in their hands. During the early months of 1858, several endeavours were made to dislodge them step by step, but the local force was not sufficient to allow of any extensive operations. Indeed, it was only by very slow degrees that order was restored; and as late as the 7th of December a body of plunderers from Oudh, under Firoz Shah, entered the District, burning and killing indiscriminately wherever they went. They were attacked and defeated at Harchandpur, and by the end of 1858 tranquillity was completely restored. Throughout the whole of this trying period, the loyalty exhibited by the people of Etawah themselves was very noticeable. Though mutineers were constantly marching through the District, almost all the native officials remained faithful to the cause of order; and many continued to guard the treasure, and even to collect revenue, in the midst of anarchy and rebellion. The principal zamindars also were loyal almost to a man.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1865 was the first enumeration of the people in which the area corresponded with that of the present time\nsufficiently for purposes of comparison. It revealed a total population of 627,378, or 384 to the square mile. The Census of 1872 showed an increase to the number of 668,641 persons, or 395 to the square mile. The Census of 1881 returned the population at 722,371, or an increase of 53,730, or 8.03 per cent. over the enumeration in 1872.\n\nThe general results arrived at by the Census of 1881 may be briefly summarized as follows:\u2014Area, 1693 square miles; number of villages and towns, 1478; houses, 105,548. Total population, 722,371, namely, males 395,224, and females 327,147; proportion of males in total population, 54.7 per cent. These figures show the usual preponderance of males, which must doubtless be to a great extent accounted for by the former prevalence of infanticide. There is reason to fear that this practice still lingers amongst the people. Average density of population, 426.5 persons per square mile; number of villages per square mile, 0.87; persons per village, 489; houses per square mile, 62; inmates per house, 6.8. As regards religious distinctions, Etawah is one of the Districts where the faith of Isl\u00e1m has never succeeded in obtaining any large body of followers. The Census of 1881 returned the number of Hindus at 679,247, or 94.0 per cent., and the Muhammadans at 41,437, or 5.7 per cent. of the total population. The remainder consists of 1526 Jains, 2 Sikhs, 158 Christians, and 1 P\u00e1rs\u00ed. The proportions which the various castes and tribes bear to one another are the same as those prevalent throughout most of the Do\u00e1b. Of the 4 great Hindu divisions, the Br\u00e1hmans numbered 96,882 persons in 1881, minutely sub-divided into the usual stocks and clans. They hold nearly one-half of the villages in the richest portions of the District, and are the most important element of the population, both from their social position and their newly-acquired landed estates. The R\u00e1jputs are returned at 55,792, and hold about one-third of the villages. They form the old territorial aristocracy of Etawah, who are being gradually ousted from their possessions by Br\u00e1hman usurers and Baniy\u00e1 traders. The last-named class is returned at 31,076 persons. The \u2018other Hindu castes\u2019 of the Census include the great body of the population, amounting in the aggregate, to 495,497 persons. The Cham\u00e1rs (106,749) head the list; they are almost without exception agricultural labourers, whom the benevolent efforts of British rule have only now succeeded in raising from a condition of abject serfdom. Ah\u00edrs come next in numerical order, with 85,655, and this tribe has some landed property of small value. The K\u00e1yasths number only 8671 persons, but they possess a considerable number of villages, and are the wealthiest landholding community, in proportion to their numbers, in Etawah. The other leading tribes are the K\u00e1chhis, 52,607; Lodh\u00eds, 38,060; Gadari\u00e1s, 24,875; Kor\u00eds, 21,900; Dh\u00e1nuks, 15,767; N\u00e1is, 15,687; Tel\u00eds, 14,137; Barh\u00e1is, 11,195; Dhob\u00eds, 10,855;\nKumbhars, 10,612; and Loh\u00e1rs, 7306. The Musalm\u00e1ns are for the most part Shaikhs or Path\u00e1ns, and are to be found chiefly in the larger towns; they belong almost without exception to the Sunn\u00ed sect. The Christian population consists of 48 Europeans, 41 Eurasians, and 69 native converts.\n\nDistribution into Town and Country.\u2014The population is still essentially agricultural, and there is little movement towards urban life. In 1881, only 3 towns had a population exceeding 5000\u2014namely, Etawah (34,721), Phaphund (7796), and Auraiya (7299). Of the 1478 villages comprising the District in 1881, 475 contained less than two hundred inhabitants, 577 from two to five hundred, 287 from five hundred to a thousand, 110 from one to two thousand, 18 from two to three thousand, 8 from three to five thousand, 2 from five to ten thousand, and 1 from twenty to thirty thousand inhabitants. As regards occupation, the Census Report classifies the male population into six main divisions as follows:\u2014Class (1) Professional, including civil and military and the learned professions, 6271; (2) domestic servants, and inn and lodging-house keepers, 1490; (3) commercial, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 6788; (4) agriculturists, including cultivators, gardeners, sheep and cattle tenders, etc., 188,672; (5) industrial, including manufacturers and artisans, 44,056; and (6) indefinite and non-productive (comprising 25,141 general labourers, and 122,806 male children and persons of no specified occupation), 147,947.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014A large portion of the area of Etawah, especially in the trans-Jumna region, is covered with jungle or rendered barren by \u00fasar plains. Of a total area of 1693 square miles, exactly one-half, or 848 square miles, were under cultivation in 1881, most of which has reached a high degree of tillage. At the date of the last settlement (1869\u201372), the area under each crop for the two harvests was found to be as follows:\u2014Rab\u00ed, or spring crops\u2014wheat, 54,776 acres; bejar, or wheat mixed with gram or barley, 137,458 acres; barley, 13,373 acres; gram, 21,830 acres; together with poppy, vegetables, and other crops, making up a grand total of 247,245 acres: khar\u00edf, or rain crops\u2014sugar-cane, 22,484 acres; cotton, 77,007 acres; bajra, 78,347 acres; jo\u00e1r, 102,845 acres; indigo, 7344 acres; together with rice, Indian corn, and other crops, making up a total of 300,371 acres; grand total, 547,616 acres. In 1882\u201383, cultivation had increased to the extent (including two-crop lands) of 278,910 acres for rab\u00ed, 366,791 acres for khar\u00edf, and 1031 acres for extra crops; grand total, 646,732 acres. The average out-turn of wheat on good soil is 21 maunds or about 15 cwts. per acre, valued at \u00a34, 18s., inclusive of the straw and the crops grown amongst it; the out-turn of cotton is 7 maunds or 5 cwts. per acre, valued at \u00a33. The system of cultivation is the same\nas that prevalent in the Do\u00e1b generally. Manure is applied every second year, and rotation of crops is practised to a slight extent. Irrigation is widely employed, and its advantages are thoroughly appreciated. Over 37 per cent. of the cultivated area has been already watered by artificial means; and the extensions of the canal system recently completed will doubtless effect a further improvement in this respect. As many as 135,801 acres were irrigated from canals alone in 1882-83, and the amount supplied from wells and ponds brings up the total to 201,919 acres. As elsewhere, the canals have been instrumental, not merely in extending the area of cultivation, but also in improving the character of the crops, by substituting indigo, sugar-cane, opium, and superior cereals for the commoner sorts of grain. The condition of the peasantry is comfortable; the Br\u00e1hman and R\u00e1jput proprietors are in easy circumstances. The people are better clothed and better fed than formerly, and their standard of living has been steadily rising of late years. The proprietors till 11 per cent. of the total area as homestead; tenants with rights of occupancy hold 57 per cent.; tenants-at-will cultivate only 23 per cent.; and the remainder is revenue-free. Rents have risen of late years, with the rise of prices and increase of population, but the enhancements have been slow and slight, owing to the strong local feeling in favour of the customary rates. It is difficult to give any statistics, as the amount varies somewhat capriciously, not only with the nature of the soil, but also with the caste of the cultivator and the mode of tenure. Good irrigated land brings in as much as \u00a31, 1s. an acre, common dry lands may fetch as little as 3s. 6d. an acre. The male agriculturists in 1881 numbered 186,499, cultivating an average of 3'03 acres each. The total population, however, dependent on the soil is returned at 484,420, or 67'06 per cent. of the entire District population. Of the total area of the District, 16'4 square miles are held revenue-free, leaving 1677 square miles assessed for Government demand, of which 877 square miles are cultivated. Total land revenue in 1881, including cesses and local rates levied on the land, \u00a3153,664, or an average of 5s. 5\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total rental paid by cultivators, including cesses, \u00a3229,678, or an average of 8s. 0\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Wages have been on the increase for some years. Cabinetmakers, masons, and smiths receive 7\u00bdd. per diem; water-carriers, 4\u00bdd. per diem; labourers, 3d.; women and boys, 2\u00bdd. per diem. Prices in the cis-Jumna tract have risen more than 50 per cent. within the last thirty years. The average prices of food-grains for the decade ending in 1870 were as follows:\u2014Wheat, 4s. 8d. per cwt.; gram, 5s. 4d. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 3s. 11\u00bdd. per cwt. In 1882-83, the average rates for food-grains per cwt. were\u2014Wheat, 5s. 11d.; jo\u00e1r and bajra, 4s. 6d.; gram, 4s.; common rice, 7s. 9d.; and barley, 4s. 9d. per cwt.\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Etawah has suffered much in previous years from drought, which produced famines in 1803, 1813, 1819, and 1837. In 1860\u201361 the District escaped with comparatively little distress, though even here measures of relief were necessary, and the number of persons relieved amounted in all to 54,101. In 1868\u201369, again, Etawah was not visited with nearly so much severity as many other portions of the Do\u00e1b. Though one-half of the kharif harvest was destroyed, rain fell in time to bring the rabi to fully two-thirds of its average amount. The highest price reached by wheat during the period of scarcity was about 9 sers per rupee, or 12s. 5d. per cwt. The famine of 1878\u201379 also affected the District, destroying the greater part of the kharif crops; the little that was raised was due entirely to canal cultivation. The spread of irrigation has done much to remove the extreme danger of famine; and the construction of the new Lower Ganges Canal will probably render the District safe in future years from actual want of food, so far as human calculation can foresee.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The exports of Etawah consist almost entirely of agricultural produce, amongst which the chief items are cotton, gram, indigo, and oil-seeds. Some of the cotton goes as far as Bombay, and a little is even sent beyond the bounds of India itself. Cloth goods, metals, drugs, and spices form the staple imports. They are distributed to consumers by the medium of religious fairs, one of which, at Doba, sometimes attracts as many as 30,000 visitors. There is also a good deal of through traffic to and from Gwalior, grain passing outward and gh\u00ed inward. The communications have improved greatly of late years. The East Indian Railway runs through the centre of the District, with stations at Jaswantnagar, Etawah, Bharthna, Achalda, and Phaph\u00fand. The Jumna is also largely used as a waterway, and carries a great part of the heavy traffic. The District contains 63 miles of \u2018first-class\u2019 roads, bridged and metalled throughout; the \u2018second\u2019 and \u2018third\u2019 class roads have a total length of 596 miles.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1860, the total revenue of Etawah amounted to \u00a3136,582, of which \u00a3121,375, or eight-ninths of the whole, was due to the land-tax. At the same date, the total expenditure amounted to \u00a390,103, or two-thirds of the revenue. In 1882\u201383, the total revenue of the District amounted to \u00a3148,191, of which \u00a3133,128 was contributed by the land revenue. In 1882, the administrative staff consisted of 2 covenanted civilians, with 7 subordinate officers; and the District contained 14 magisterial and 13 civil and revenue courts. The police in the same year numbered 516 men of all ranks, namely, District police 392, and municipal and town police 124, maintained at a cost of \u00a35620, of which \u00a34862 was derived from provincial funds, and the balance from local funds. This force was supplemented by 1388 village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs) and 66 road patrols, upon whose main-\ntenance a further sum of \u00a35274 was expended. The whole machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property, consisted of 1970 men of all ranks, being 1 man to every 0.81 square mile and every 366 inhabitants; and the total expense of the establishment was \u00a310,894, or about 3\u00bdd. per head of the population. A single jail suffices for the criminal population; the average daily number of prisoners in 1870 was 226, and in 1882, 243.72, of whom 223 were labouring convicts. In 1881, there were 132 Government inspected schools, with 3883 pupils. There are also a number of private schools uninspected by the Government educational officers; and the Census Report of 1881 returned 4807 boys and 91 girls as under instruction, besides 15,966 males and 251 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. The District possesses a superior educational establishment in Hume's High School, founded by the Collector in 1861. The District is sub-divided into 5 tahsils, with an aggregate of 1813 estates owned by 15,523 registered proprietors or coparceners. The only municipality in 1882-83 was Etawah town.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Etawah was formerly reported as hot and sultry to an oppressive degree, but the planting of trees and the spread of canal irrigation have modified its character of late years. It is now comparatively moist and equable, and the District is among the healthiest in the plains of India. The rainfall was 49.6 inches in 1867-68, 14.8 inches in 1868-69 (the year of scarcity), 34.2 inches in 1869-70, and 46.6 inches in 1870-71. In 1881, the rainfall was 30.40 inches, the average for the twenty years previous being 27.17 inches. The chief endemic disease is fever of a malarious type, which seems occasionally to assume an epidemic typhoidal form. The District is also visited from time to time by small-pox and cholera. In 1874, the total number of deaths recorded was 19,276 (28.83 per 1000 of the population); and of these no fewer than 12,684 were due to fever, while 4841 were set down to small-pox. In 1880-81, the registered deaths numbered 22,993, or 37.3 per 1000 of the population, of which no fewer than 20,040 were ascribed to fever alone. In 1882, the registered death-rate fell to 28.33 per thousand, as against an average of 30.88 per thousand in the previous five years. The cattle of Etawah are subject to frequent attacks both of rinderpest and of foot-and-mouth disease. [For a further description of Etawah, see the Gazetteer of the North-Western Provinces, compiled by E. T. Atkinson, Esq., vol. iv. pp. 219-472 (Allahabad, 1876); the Report on the Settlement of Etawah District, from 1868-69 to 1873, by C. H. J. Crossthwaite, Esq. Also the Census Report of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh in 1881; together with the Administration and Departmental Reports of the North-Western Provinces from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nEtawah.\u2014North-western tahsil of Etawah District, North-Western\nProvinces, including a considerable tract in the Do\u00e1b, watered by a branch of the Ganges Canal, and extending into the ravine-covered country on the banks of the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1), together with an isolated wedge of land between that river and the Chambal, consisting for the most part of wild jungle-clad gorges. Area, 425 square miles, of which 222 are cultivated. Population (1881) 193,211, namely, males 105,319, and females 87,892. Hindus numbered 175,946; Muhammadans, 15,893; Jains, 1249; \u2018others,\u2019 123. Land revenue, \u00a327,813; total Government revenue, \u00a329,473; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a349,032. The tahsil contains 1 civil and 7 criminal courts, with a regular police force of 80 officers and men, and a village watch of 358 men.\n\nEtawah.\u2014Town, municipality, and administrative head-quarters of Etawah District, North-Western Provinces. Situated in latitude 26\u00b0 45' 31\" N., and longitude 79\u00b0 3' 18\" E., among the ravines on the left bank of the Jumna, at a point where the river bends sharply backwards upon its own course. Population (1881) 34,721, namely, 18,311 males and 16,410 females. Hindus numbered 23,552; Muhammadans, 10,289; Jains, 765; Christians, 112; and \u2018others,\u2019 3; area of town site, 500 acres. Municipal income in 1882-83, \u00a32365, of which \u00a31940, or 1s. 2d. per head, was derived from taxation; expenditure, \u00a32298. The suburbs extend nearly down to the water\u2019s edge, but the main quarter is separated from the Jumna river by a strip of broken country about half a mile in length, while to the north the houses stretch to within a quarter of a mile of the Etawah station of the East Indian Railway. The town proper is situated among the ravines, which, owing to their wild and irregular forms, present a picturesque and pleasing appearance, especially where the broader ravines are clothed with trees. These trees are so abundant in places, that from many points of view the city looks like one large garden, amidst which buildings appear enshrouded in green. A somewhat broader fissure than the others separates the old from the new town, between which, owing to the uneven nature of the ground, communication was at one time difficult; but now fine, broad, metalled roadways taken over the ravines by embankments and bridges, render communication at all times easy and practicable. The roads from Agra and Mainpuri unite outside the city to the north-west, and are continued through the new quarter, forming the principal bazar-way, and lined on each side by substantially-built and fine-looking shops. The main road between Gwalior and Farukhabad intersects the Agra and Mainpuri road at right angles about the centre of the bazar. Hume-ganj, a handsome square, called after a late Collector, A. O. Hume, C.B., contains the public buildings, and forms the centre of the city. It includes a market-place, tahsil, and Magistrate\u2019s courts, mission-house, police station, and dispensary. Hume\u2019s\nHigh School is a handsome building, erected chiefly by private subscription. The north and south sides of the square form the principal grain and cotton markets. A saraii, with a fine well and arched gateway, adjoins the square. The civil station lies about half a mile to the north of the town. The roads are numerous and well metalled, and the station is well stocked with plantations of shady trees. The railway buildings occupy the east end of the station, and next to them is the jail. The offices of the Collector and Magistrate lie about a quarter of a mile to the west of the jail; and beyond them, to the north-west, are the church, public garden, racket court, and billiard room; also telegraph and post office. Etawah was formerly a military station; but the garrison, which had been reduced to the wing of a native regiment, was entirely withdrawn in 1861, and the buildings of the old cantonments have disappeared. Etawah carries on a considerable trade in gh\u00ed (clarified butter), gram, cotton, and oil-seeds, the traders principally belonging to the Kurmi caste. No important manufacture of any kind is carried on. A kind of coloured native cloth named tapti is woven, and one quarter of the city, mahall\u00e1 Dabgar\u00e1n, derives its name from the Dabgars, or makers of skins for carrying oil and gh\u00ed; but owing to the greater employment of tins and casks for this purpose, the industry is declining. Another mahall\u00e1, Sh\u00e1kligar\u00e1n, is so called from its being the residence of the Sh\u00e1kligars, or comb-makers and workers in horn. Etawah is also noted for the manufacture of a sweetmeat called peth\u00e1, which is much esteemed by natives and is largely exported. The Jama Masjid, or \u2018great mosque,\u2019 originally a Hindu or Buddhist temple, stands on the right-hand side of the Gwalior road, and is interesting from its numerous fragments of early workmanship. The Asthala, situated in a grove to the west of the city, ranks first among the Hindu places of worship; it was built about ninety years ago by one Gop\u00e1l D\u00e1s, a Br\u00e1hman, in honour of Nara Singha, an incarnation of Vishnu. Another Hindu temple, dedicated to Mahadeo Tiksi, stands among the ravines between the city and the Jumna. The bathing gh\u00fats along the river\u2019s edge are lined by many handsome shrines; and a modern Jain building, with a lofty white spire, forms a striking object. The fort, the stronghold of a Th\u00e1kur in olden times, appears to have been founded on a still earlier mound, and makes a handsome ruin, with massive bastions and an underground passage, used to the present day as a pathway to the summit. The city dates back to a period before the Musalm\u00e1n conquest, both Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed and Shah\u00e1bud-d\u00edn Ghor\u00ed having plundered it during their expeditions. The fort was built by the Chauh\u00e1ns on their immigration into this wild tract, and occupied by a Musalm\u00e1n governor after their expulsion. B\u00e1bar and the Muhammadan historians frequently mention it as a place of great strength. In the 17th century, Etawah became a famous\nbanking and commercial town, but suffered greatly, on the decline of the Mughal Empire, from Rohill\u00e1 and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 raids. For its later history and the events of the Mutiny, see Etawah District.\n\n**Ettiapuram.**\u2014Zamind\u00e1ri or estate in Otapidaram taluk, Tinneveli District, Madras Presidency.

The Division comprises the three Districts of Faizabad, Gonda, and Bahraich, all of which see separately. It is bounded on the north by the Nep\u00e1l tar\u00fai; on the east by Gorakhpur; on the south by Azamgarh and Sult\u00e1npur; and on the west by Bara Banki, Sit\u00e1pur, and Kheri. Area (1881) 7305 square miles; number of towns or villages, 7362; number of houses, 586,846. Total population, 3,230,393, namely, 1,656,132 males and 1,574,261 females. Hindus numbered 2,791,892, or 86\u00b74 per cent.; Muhammadans, 436,337, or 13\u00b75 per cent.; Sikhs, 591; Jains, 41; Buddhist, 1; P\u00e1rsis, 2; Jews, 17; and Christians, 1512. Average density of population, 442 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 1\u00b700; persons per village, 439; houses per square mile, 80; persons per house, 5\u00b75. Total cultivated area, 2,546,240 acres; number of adult male agriculturists, 859,535, or 2\u00b794 acres of cultivated land for each male agriculturist; total agricultural population, including agricultural labourers, 2,566,012, or 79\u00b743 per cent. of the total population. Of the total area of 7305 square miles, 6539 square miles are assessed for Government revenue, of which 3864 square miles are under cultivation; unassessed area, 765 square miles, of which 85 square miles are cultivated. Total land revenue, including cesses, \u00a3397,341, or an average of 3s. 2\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Average rental paid by the cultivators, 6s. 2\u00bcd. per acre.\nFaiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d).\u2014District of Oudh, in the Division of the same name, under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, lying between $26^\\circ 9'$ and $26^\\circ 50'$ N. lat., and between $81^\\circ 43'$ and $83^\\circ 9'$ E. long. In shape, the District is an irregular parallelogram running from west to east, with a slight tendency southwards; length, varying from 85 miles in the north to 64 in the south; average width, from 20 to 25 miles. Bounded on the north by Gonda and Basti Districts, the Gogra river forming the boundary-line; on the east by Gorakhpur; on the south by Azamgarh and Sult\u00e1npur; and on the west by Bara Banki. Area, 1689 square miles. Population (1881) 1,081,419. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Faizabad.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The physical features of the country are similar to those of the neighbouring Districts of Oudh, and require but brief notice. Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d consists of a densely-populous, well-cultivated plain of great fertility, having an average elevation of 350 feet above sea-level, without hills or valleys, and devoid of forests, but well wooded with numerous mango and bamboo groves, and scattered pipal and simul trees. The drainage is towards the south-east. The principal river, affording the chief means of communication between Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d and the Gangetic valley, is the Gogra (Gh\u00e1gra), which flows along its whole northern frontier for a distance of 95 miles, being navigable throughout by the largest-sized cargo-boats and river steamers. The banks of the river are about 25 feet above cold weather water-level. They are never flooded, but a breadth of low-lying land between the banks and the stream is submerged every rainy season. The other rivers are\u2014the Tons, formed by the confluence of the Biso\u00ed and the Madha rivers; and the Majho\u00ed, which marks the boundary between Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d and Sult\u00e1npur. The Tons is navigable during the rains as far as Akbarpur by boats of about 5 tons burthen. Its banks are steep; in many places covered with \u00fasar, in others fringed with jungle. Many other small streams flow through the District. Water is everywhere abundant, and lies close to the surface. Although there are no large jhils or lakes, there are innumerable artificially-constructed tanks and natural water-holes and small swamps, which afford ample means for easy irrigation. Owing perhaps to the greater extent of cultivation, Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d is worse stocked with game than any other District of Oudh. Wild hog are tolerably numerous near the Gogra, and antelope are occasionally met with in the west of the District; bears and deer are unknown; ducks and geese are comparatively scarce. Fisheries unimportant.\n\nHistory.\u2014The early history of Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d is that of Ajodhya (q.v.), of which kingdom it formed a part. (See also Sahet Mahet.) Passing from the time of R\u00e1mchandra\u2014the hero of the Sanskrit\nepic, the *R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a*\u2014through the subsequent period of Buddhist supremacy; its decline; the revival of Br\u0101hma\u1e47ism under King Vikram\u0101ditya of Ujjain; the struggles between Buddhism and Br\u0101hma\u1e47ism; and the subsequent re-establishment of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47ical faith about the 8th century A.D.\u2014we come to the first event in what may be called the modern history of the country, namely the Muhammadan invasion. In 1030, Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1\u00fad, the son of S\u00e1l\u00e1r S\u00e1hu, one of the generals of Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad, invaded Oudh, and passed through Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d. It is not certain whether any great battle was fought here, but a portion of the high road is still pointed out, along which the country people will not pass after dark. They say that at night the road is thronged with headless horsemen of Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r\u2019s army. Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r, after a series of victories, was slain, and his troops completely defeated, at B\u0101hraich by the confederate R\u00e1jput princes. These afterwards turned against each other, and the Province seems to have been split up into a number of petty fiefs. After the conquest of Kanauj, the Musalm\u00e1ns again overran Oudh, and succeeded in consolidating their rule. Ajodhya long remained the capital of the Province; but by the early part of the 18th century it had given way to Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, a few miles to the west. Shuj\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, however, was the first of the Oudh Viceroys who made Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d his permanent residence in 1756. After his death in 1780, the capital was removed to Lucknow.\n\nThe only important event in the history of the District since the annexation of the Province was the Mutiny of 1857. In the early part of that year, the troops in cantonments consisted of the 22nd Bengal Native Infantry, the 6th Irregular Oudh Cavalry, a company of the 7th Bengal Artillery, and a horse battery of light field-guns. The troops revolted on the night of the 8th June, but the outbreak was not accompanied with the scenes of massacre which occurred at other military stations. The European officers, with their wives and families, were allowed to leave unmolested; and although some of them were attacked in their flight by mutineers of other regiments, they nearly all succeeded, after more or less hardship, in reaching places of safety. A Muhammadan landholder, M\u00edr Mu\u1e25ammad Husain Kh\u00e1n, sheltered one party in his small fort for several days, until the road was open and they could reach Gorakhpur in safety.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The population of Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, according to the Census of 1869, but allowing for later transfers, was 1,024,652 upon the area constituting the present District. In 1881, the Census returned a population of 1,081,419, an increase of 56,767, or 5\u00b725 per cent., in twelve years. The results of the Census of 1881 may be briefly summarized as follows:\u2014Area, 1689 square miles; number of towns and villages, 2676; houses, 206,258. Total population, 1,081,419, namely, males 546,174, and females 535,245; proportion\nof males in total population, 50.5 per cent. Average density of population, 640 persons per square mile; towns or villages per square mile, 1.58; persons per village, 405; houses per square mile, 122; persons per house, 5.2. Classified according to religion, the Census returned the population as follows:\u2014Hindus, 955,458, or 88.4 per cent.; and Muhammadans, 124,539, or 11.5 per cent. of the population. Christians numbered 1294; Sikhs, 104; Jains, 4; Jews, 17; Buddhist, 1; and Parsis, 2. The Hindu castes of Faizabad are the same as those found in the rest of Oudh. The Brahmins stand first, with 153,982, or 14.2 per cent. of the total population; the despised Chamars, the lowest caste in social rank, come next with 136,310, or 12.6 per cent.; followed by the Ahirs, with 121,972, or 11.3 per cent. The Rajputs or Kshatriyas, who rank socially next to the Brahmins, form the wealthy landed class, and own two-thirds of the soil, although numbering only 68,109, or 6.3 per cent. of the population. The remaining Hindu castes, numbering upwards of 5000 souls, are as follow: Kurmi, 64,978; Kachhi, 38,255; Mallah, 34,493; Pasi, 32,305; Baniya, 31,470; Kahar, 29,441; Bhar, 20,371; Kumbhar, 18,055; Kor, 17,703; Dhobi, 14,528; Nai, 14,419; Teli, 14,408; Kayasth, 14,317; Gadaria, 13,799; Barhai, 12,684; Lohar, 12,211; Kalwar, 11,781; Tambuli, 10,686; Liona, 9162; and Bhurji, 8526. Although of the 124,539 Muhammadans the great majority (113,030, or 91 per cent.) belong to the Sunni sect, yet Faizabad has, with the exception of Lucknow, a larger number and proportion of followers of the Shiah sect (11,460, or 9 per cent. of the Muhammadan population) than any other District in Oudh. The Shias form the most influential class, and are principally met with in Faizabad city, which was for long the residence of a Shiah court. Unspecified Muhammadans, 49. Of the 1294 Christians, 1117 were British born or Europeans by race, 119 were Eurasians, and 58 native converts.\n\nDivision into Town and Country.\u2014The population is almost entirely rural, the urban residents in the five towns numbering only 83,614 souls, or less than 8 per cent. of the population. These towns are Faizabad city and cantonment (population, 43,927); Tanda, 16,594; Ajodhya, 11,643; Jalalpur, 6240; and Ronahi (or Naurahi), 5210. Faizabad and Ajodhya, which are adjacent towns, have been constituted into a single municipality. The only other municipality is Tanda. Of the 2676 villages which the District contained in 1881, 1110 had fewer than two hundred inhabitants; 968 from two to five hundred; 428 from five hundred to a thousand; 136 from one to two thousand; 29 from two to five thousand; and 5 upwards of five thousand inhabitants. As regards occupation, the Census Report classifies the male population into the following six main divisions or groups: Class (1) Professional,\nincluding civil and military and the learned professions, 6473; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 2132; (3) commercial, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 6957; (4) agricultural, including cultivators, gardeners, and keepers of animals, 274,589; (5) industrial, including manufacturers and artisans, 39,234; (6) indefinite and non-productive (comprising 12,249 general labourers and 204,540 male children and persons of no specified occupation), 216,789.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The principal agricultural staples are wheat and rice, which together make up 41 per cent. of the total area under cultivation. This was returned in 1883 at 1240 square miles, or 793,891 acres, including land yielding two crops in the year. The total area actually cultivated was 949 square miles, or 607,208 acres. The acreage under each crop in 1883 (including land bearing two crops in the year) is returned as follows:\u2014Wheat, 109,342; rice, 215,822; j\u00f4\u00e1r, urd, gram, peas, barley, and arhar, 410,670; sugar-cane, 30,231; oil-seeds, 12,746; opium, 8597; indigo, 3457; and miscellaneous crops, 1157 acres. The average produce per acre of the different crops is thus returned:\u2014Rice, 737 lbs.; wheat, 816 lbs.; inferior food-grains, 1029 lbs.; oil-seeds, 277; sugar (unrefined), 2016 lbs. Irrigation is largely practised, but there are no Government canals or irrigation works in the District. The area irrigated by private individuals in 1883 amounted to 352,730 acres. The water is principally derived from jhils and tanks, but masonry wells are more commonly used for this purpose in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d than in any other District in Oudh. Water is met with at various depths, varying from 12 feet along the banks of the Gogra to 37 feet in parts beyond the old bed of the river. A masonry well, 25 feet deep, and sufficiently large for two pulleys to be worked at once, costs about \u00a325 if mortared, or \u00a317, 10s. if unmortared. Such a well is worked by five men, who can irrigate one local bigh\u00e1 (about 1150 square yards) in a day. One watering costs from 3s. 9d. to 5s. an acre, according to the current rate of wages. In the tar\u00e1\u00ee, where water is found within 12 feet of the surface, the well is a mere hole, and 3 men are able to irrigate a bigh\u00e1 at a cost of from 2s. 4\u00bdd. to 3s. 1\u00bdd. for each watering. As a rule, sugar-cane is watered 10 times, opium and tobacco each 7, barley, peas, and mas\u00fari, once. Wheat requires a double well for every 12 acres, opium and tobacco for every 5, and barley, peas, etc., for every 15. Rents are high, and are still rising. The rate per acre in 1883 for land growing the different crops is thus returned:\u2014Opium and tobacco, 19s. 3d.; sugar-cane, 18s. 3d.; wheat, 14s. 9d.; rice, 11s. 9d.; inferior food-grains, 9s. 6d.; oil-seeds, 5s. 6d.; indigo, 13s. Classified according to the different qualities of land, rents may be set down as follows:\u2014Manured crops near the village, 25s. per acre; irrigated loam, 16s.; unirrigated loam,\nsandy unirrigated loam, 7s. The total male adult agricultural population of the District, including agricultural labourers, is returned by the Census at 245,954, cultivating 608,192 acres, or an average of 2'47 acres each. The total agricultural population, however, dependent on the soil numbers 834,294, or 77'15 per cent. of the District population. Of the total area of 1689 square miles, 1663 are assessed for Government revenue, of which 933 square miles are cultivated and 272 cultivable. Total Government assessment, including rates and cesses, \u00a3121,297, or an average of 4s. 0\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Rent paid by cultivators, including cesses, \u00a3199,740, or an average of 6s. 6\u00bed. per cultivated acre. The cultivator's profits are probably the same in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d as in other parts of Oudh\u2014just enough to pay for his labour and for the keeping up of his stock. Of late years, however, owing to the rise of rent, bad harvests, and cattle murrain, they have not reached this standard. The difficulties of the cultivating class are not due to the Government revenue being too heavy, but to pressure put upon them by the petty proprietors and middle-men, who have to raise the rents in order to enable them to live according to their old standard of comfort. The land is divided among a few large and an immense number of small proprietors. The large t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri estates are 32 in number, containing an area of 998,000 acres, or an average of 49 square miles each. Included within these fiefs are many sub-tenures, which have been granted by the t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs or decreed by the courts. These consist of 703 villages, and cover an area of 250,000 acres, or a little over one-fourth of the parent estates. The number of these sub-proprietors is 22,846, the average area of each estate being 14 acres. The small independent estates number about 17,000; average area, 29 acres. Tenants possessing occupancy rights are said to number about 2\u00bd per cent. of the whole.\n\nThe agricultural stock in the District in 1883 was returned as follows: Cows and bullocks, 372,677; horses and ponies, 2733; donkeys, 2328; sheep and goats, 51,496; pigs, 56,953; carts, 955; ploughs, 82,884. Wages are paid both in money and in grain. Throughout the District the ordinary rate of money wages for unskilled labour is 3d., and for skilled labour 6d. a day, but rates are higher in the neighbourhood of Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d town. Prices of food-grains have considerably advanced of late years. Between the ten years 1861\u20131870, prices for common unhulled rice rose from 3s. to 4s. 2d. a cwt., common husked rice from 7s. to 8s. 2d., wheat from 4s. 6d. to 5s. 11d., jo\u00e1r from 3s. 6d. to 4s. 7d., b\u00e1jra from 4s. 2d. to 7s. 10d., gram from 4s. 8d. to 6s. 3d., arhar from 4s. 7d. to 5s. 9d., urd from 5s. 6d. to 7s. 3d., m\u00fag from 7s. 2d. to 8s. 4d., mas\u00fari from 4s. 2d. to 5s. 7d. a cwt. The average prices in 1883 were (according to quality), for wheat from 5s. 7d. to 5s. 9\u00bdd. a cwt., rice from 8s. 4\u00bed. to 10s. 6d. per cwt., and gram 4s. 2d. per cwt.\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The three last famines which afflicted the District occurred in 1869, 1874, and 1877\u201378, being caused by the failure of the rains in the preceding years. Famines in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d are of two kinds\u2014one of food itself, and the other of the means to purchase food, which may be termed a labour famine. The first outward sign of distress is shown when the small farmers, who pay their labourers grain wages, turn them off to shift for themselves. The result is that these men emigrate from the District as scarcity approaches, long before there is absolute famine; the demand for food is diminished, and the crisis perhaps tided over till the next harvest. Another cause which mitigates the effect of a bad crop in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, is the great variety of the staples sown. Rice, jo\u00e1r, barley, gram, urd, and peas are all grown in fair proportion; whereas in the neighbouring Districts of Gonda and Bahr\u00e1\u00edch, if the rice fails, there is nothing to fall back upon. In Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, the harvests follow within every two months of each other, except from June to September.\n\nCommunications, Trade, Commerce, etc.\u2014Besides the water highway along the Gogra, means of communication are afforded by two good metalled roads to Sult\u00e1npur, Part\u00e1bgarh, and Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d on the south, and to Dary\u00e1b\u00e1d, Naw\u00e1bganj, and Lucknow on the west, aggregating 60 miles in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d District. Good unmetalled roads cross the country in every direction, aggregating 534 miles. There are numerous ferries on the Gogra, and a bridge of boats is maintained at Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d town during the dry season. A branch of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway also intersects the District for a length of 66 miles, with stations at Malipur, Akbarpur, Gos\u00e1inganj, N\u00e1ra, Darshannagar, Ajodhy\u00e1, Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Sohw\u00e1l. The navigable water communication is 95 miles in length. The trade of Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d District cannot be estimated with any approach to accuracy. The registered river-borne imports and exports for 1872 and 1873 were as follows:\u2014The value of the imports, consisting principally of sugar, tobacco, spices, salt, cattle, and English piece-goods, was returned at \u00a3159,350 in 1872, and \u00a3158,272 in 1873; while that of the exports (principally wheat and other food-grains, hides, timber, country cloth, etc.) was returned at \u00a3333,336 in 1872, and \u00a3306,325 in 1873. These figures, however, do not show the actual exports and imports of Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, but merely indicate the course of river trade at marts within the District boundary. The internal trade by road or river with other parts of Oudh is not given. For instance, Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d exports a large quantity of opium by rail to Lucknow; but although much of it is produced in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d itself, none of it, or of any other railway traffic, is credited to the District in the trade returns. These, again, exhibit Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d as a large importer of sugar; it really produces more than is required for its own consumption. The fact is that the sugar of Basti and Azam-\ngarh passes through Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d to Lucknow, whence it is distributed to Cawnpur and Bareli. Country cloth is largely exported from T\u00e1nda; timber is exported really from Kheri and Bahr\u00e1ich, but is credited to Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, as the logs are counted in this District. The grain exported is mainly rice, wheat, and maize, but much of it comes from neighbouring Districts, and is embarked in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, which acts as an emporium for Eastern Oudh.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The judicial staff consists of the Divisional Commissioner, Civil Judge, Deputy Commissioner, with 2 European and 3 native assistants, a cantonment magistrate, and 4 revenue collectors (tahsild\u00e1rs), a subordinate judge, and 3 muns\u00edfs. There are also 11 magistrates, all of whom have civil and revenue powers; besides 2 honorary magistrates. The total imperial revenue of the District in 1875\u201376 amounted to \u00a3151,856, of which \u00a3133,242 was derived from the land. The total expense of civil administration, as represented by the cost of the District officials and police, amounted in the same year to \u00a318,097. In 1882\u201383, the imperial revenue had slightly decreased to \u00a3141,433, owing to a decrease in the land revenue, which had been lowered to \u00a3110,027; cost of officials and police, \u00a318,107. The regular police force in 1882\u201383 consisted of 528 officers and men, maintained at a cost to the State of \u00a35964; the rural police consisted of 2490 village watchmen, and 7 men on road patrol, maintained at a cost of \u00a36135; and there was also a municipal force of 272 men, costing \u00a31756 from municipal funds. During 1881, 1089 cases were brought by the police before the magistrates, and 848 convictions obtained. Crime reaches its maximum in July, the month when grain is scarcest. The District jail contained a daily average of 504'17 prisoners in 1882, of whom 35'17 were females. The Government or aided educational institutions consisted in 1872\u201373 of 162 schools, attended by 4633 pupils; and in 1880\u201381 of 184 schools, with 5294 pupils. In 1882\u201383, the number of Government inspected schools had fallen to 89, and the pupils to 3891. There are also a number of private schools not under inspection; the Census Report in 1881 returned 4657 boys and 60 girls as under instruction in that year, besides 21,298 males and 380 females able to read and write, but not under instruction.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The rainfall of Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d is more regular than in Western Oudh, and during the fifteen years ending 1881 has averaged 42'90 inches. The rainfall in the latter year was 32'80 inches, or 10'10 inches below the average. Mean temperature (1875), May 87'9\u00b0 F., July 85'6\u00b0, December 65'6\u00b0. The principal diseases of the District are fevers. Small-pox is also prevalent, and cholera occasionally makes its appearance in an epidemic form. The registered deaths in 1882 numbered 33,552, or at the rate of 33'08 per thousand of the\npopulation, against a mean of 25\u00b728 per thousand for the five previous years. The deaths from fever alone amounted in 1882 to 26,701, and from cholera to 2841. Four charitable dispensaries in the District, at Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d town, T\u00e1nda, Akbarpur, and Bikapur, afforded medical relief in 1883 to 923 in-door and 20,227 out-door patients.

Area, 342 square miles, of which 201 are cultivated. Population (1881) 290,942, namely, males 148,170, and females 142,772. Hindus numbered 249,659; Muhammadans, 39,866; Jains, 4; and 'others,' 1413. The tahsil consists of the 3 parg\u00e1ns of Haweli Oudh, Mangalsi, and Ams\u00edr.\n\nFaiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d).\u2014Chief town, municipality, and cantonment, Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Oudh; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 46' 45\" N., and long. 82\u00b0 11' 40\" E., on the left bank of the river Gogra, 78 miles east of Lucknow. Adjoining it on the west is the modern Ajodhya, both towns being on the site of the ancient city of AJODHYA. Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d is a comparatively modern place, although there are several ancient Muhammadan buildings in its vicinity. Mans\u00far \u00c1li Kh\u00e1n, Viceroy of Oudh, in 1732 passed a portion of his time here; but his successor, Shuj\u00e1-ud-daul\u00e1, took up his permanent residence at Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, and made it the Provincial capital in 1760. Twenty years later, Asaf-ud-daul\u00e1 moved the court back again to Lucknow. The city has fallen into decay since the death of the celebrated Bahu Begam in 1816, who had held it rent-free since 1798, and who lived and died here. Her mausoleum is described as 'the finest building of the kind in Oudh.' The D\u00edlkushi palace adjoining the tomb was the residence of this lady; it is now the opium storehouse. Several other Muhammadan buildings, mosques, gardens, etc., all more or less out of repair, are situated in the town. The population of the town proper in 1881 was 38,828, namely, Hindus, 26,602; Muhammadans, 11,976; Christians, 209; and 'others,' 41; area of town site, 867 acres. The cantonment contained a population of 5099, consisting of Hindus, 3034; Muhammadans, 963; Christians, 1044; and 'others,'\n58; area, 708 acres. Total, town and cantonments, 43,927, namely, Hindus, 29,636; Muhammadans, 12,939; Christians, 1253; 'others,' 99. The military force consists of a battery of Royal Artillery, one European, and one native infantry regiment. Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d together with Ajodhya constitutes one municipality, with a total population of 71,405. The municipal income (1882-83) amounted to \u00a35204, of which \u00a34347 was derived from octroi; and the expenditure to \u00a35845. There are numerous markets in the town, and trade is very active, the estimated annual sales within municipal limits amounting to about \u00a3150,000, of which upwards of one-half consists of wheat, rice, and other food-grains. Large station on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway.\n\nFaizpur.\u2014Town in Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency; situated in lat. 21\u00b0 11' N., and long. 75\u00b0 56' E., 72 miles north-east of Dhuli\u00e1. Population (1881) 9640, namely, 8055 Hindus, 1295 Muhammadans, 195 Jains, and 95 'others.' Faizpur is famous for its cotton prints, and its dark blue and red dyes. There are about 250 families who dye thread, turbans, and other pieces of cloth, and print cloth of all sorts. Weekly timber market, and one of the chief cotton marts in Kh\u00e1ndesh.\n\nFakhrpur.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Bahr\u00e1\u00edch District, Oudh; bounded on the north by N\u00e1np\u00e1ra pargan\u00e1; on the east and south by Bahr\u00e1\u00edch and His\u00e1mpur; and on the west by S\u00edt\u00e1pur District. A large pargan\u00e1, which has undergone many changes of area. As at present defined, it comprises a great portion of what was once Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d, while, on the other hand, a number of its former villages have been transferred to His\u00e1mpur. The Sarju and a small sluggish stream, the Bhakosa, flow through the pargan\u00e1, and several well-defined deserted channels mark old beds of the Gogra (Ghagr\u00e1), which now flows to the south. Water is commonly met with so close to the surface, that irrigation is scarcely required. Area, 383 square miles, of which 217 are under cultivation, and 114 are cultivable waste. Government land revenue, \u00a39248; average incidence, 1s. 5\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated area, 11\u00bdd. per acre of assessed area, and 9\u00bdd. per acre of total area. The principal landlord is the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of K\u00e1p\u00farthala, on whom the estate of the rebel R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Baundi has been conferred at a quit-rent for ever. Sard\u00e1rs Fateh Singh and Jugjot Singh, reputed grandsons of Mahar\u00e1ja Ranj\u00edt Singh of Lahore, are the grantees of the Ch\u00e1hl\u00e1ri R\u00e1j\u00e1's estate. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Rahw\u00e1's estates also lie almost entirely in this pargan\u00e1. Of the 288 villages which compose the pargan\u00e1, 227 are held under t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri tenure, and 161 are permanently settled. Population (1881) 151,737, namely, males 79,897, and females 71,840. The most numerous castes are Br\u00e1hmans, Ah\u00edrs, and Cham\u00e1rs. Three lines of road intersect the pargan\u00e1. Eight market villages, the most\nimportant of which is at J\u00e1t\u00e1pur, which has a large well-frequented b\u00e1z\u00e1r. Government schools in nine villages, besides an English town school at Baundi maintained by the Kapurth\u00e1la State; police station at S\u00edsia; post-offices at Baundi and S\u00edsia.\n\n**Fakhrpur.**\u2014Village in Bahr\u00e1ich District, Oudh; on the high road from Bahramgh\u00e1t to Bahr\u00e1ich, 10\u00bd miles from the latter town. Lat. 27\u00b0 25' 55\" N., long. 81\u00b0 31' 41\" E. The village is pleasantly situated among park-like groves of mango trees, but is unhealthy, owing to bad water; goitre is very prevalent. In former times the place is said to have been held by Ah\u00edrs. In Akbar's reign it was made the headquarters of a pargan\u00e1 named after it, a fort was built, and a tahsil or revenue collectorate established. Up to 1818, the tahsild\u00e1r had his fort and treasury here, but in the latter year the larger portion of the pargan\u00e1 was incorporated in the Baundi estate (il\u00e1k\u00e1), and from that time the fort has ceased to be used. The village has been held now for many years by the revenue officers of the pargan\u00e1. The population of the village has dwindled away from 2140 in 1869 to 387 in 1881. Saltpetre is prepared, but not to any great extent. No market. Government school.\n\n**Fak\u00edrganj.**\u2014Commercial village in Din\u00e1jpur District, Bengal. Exports of rice, gunny cloth, and jute.\n\n**Fak\u00edrh\u00e1t.**\u2014Village in the S\u00e1tkhira Sub-division of the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal; situated in lat. 22\u00b0 23' 30\" N., long. 89\u00b0 7' 15\" E., 5 miles south-east of K\u00e1l\u00edganj police station. Bi-weekly market. Traffic carried on entirely by means of water communication.\n\n**False Point.**\u2014Cape, harbour, and lighthouse in Cuttack District, Bengal; situated in lat. 20\u00b0 20' 10\" N., and long. 86\u00b0 46' 25\" E., on the north of the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1di estuary. The harbour consists of an anchorage, land-locked by islands and sandbanks, with two navigable channels. False Point takes its name from the circumstance that it was often mistaken by ships for Point Palmyras, one degree farther north. It is the best harbour on the Indian coast between the H\u00fagl\u00ed and Bombay. The lighthouse stands on the point which screens it from the southern monsoon, in lat. 20\u00b0 19' 52\" N., long. 86\u00b0 46' 57\" E. The anchorage is protected by two sandy reefs, named Long Island and Dowdeswell Island, and is completely land-locked by the latter. Point Reddie, on Dowdeswell Island, shelters the entrance. Farther in lies Plowden Island, for the most part a low jungly swamp, with a limited area of high ground suitable for building purposes, and with good drinking water. The harbour is safe and roomy, the channel properly buoyed, and a soft mud bottom prevents injury to vessels running aground. The port is now open throughout the year, and ships of large tonnage can lie in security in all weathers. Two separate channels lead inland\nfrom the anchorage\u2014the Jambu river on the north, and on the south the Bakud creek, a short deep branch of the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1di. Bars of sand intervene between the anchorage and these channels, but at full tide cargo-boats and steamers enter with ease. Several tidal creeks, narrow and winding, but navigable by country boats throughout the year, connect False Point with the Dh\u00e1mra and Br\u00e1hman\u00ed rivers on the north, and with the Dev\u00ed on the south.\n\nHistory of False Point Harbour.\u2014It is only within the last twenty years that the capabilities of False Point Harbour have been appreciated. Prior to this period\u2014although the place is but two days by steamer from Calcutta\u2014no regular communication existed, and the exports, consisting chiefly of rice, were entirely in the hands of native shipmasters from Madras. The port was opened in 1860, about which date an enterprising French firm in Calcutta established an agency for the export of rice, and the East Indian Irrigation Company perceived its natural advantages as an import d\u00e9p\u00f4t. But it was during the year of the great Orissa famine (1866), when Government was anxiously exploring every means of throwing supplies into the Province, that the capabilities of False Point were first publicly appreciated. The formation of new canals has been the making of the port. The Kendra-para Canal, which extends from Cuttack for a distance of $42\\frac{1}{2}$ miles, connects False Point with the capital of Orissa; and False Point has now become the entrep\u00f4t for the trade of the Province. A small steamer plies regularly between the entrance to the canal near the harbour and Cuttack. The British Indian General Steam Navigation Company make the place a regular port of call; it is also visited by French ships from Mauritius, which take rice and oil-seeds for that island, and also for Havre, Bordeaux, and other French ports. False Point was formerly considered very unhealthy; but the malaria to which it owed this evil reputation has to a great extent disappeared. A harbourmaster and superintendent of customs have been appointed.\n\nTrade.\u2014In 1860, 4 vessels, with a total tonnage of 2830 tons, entered the port; the value of exports was returned at \u00a36759. During the years between 1863\u201364 and 1883\u201384, the trade has increased from \u00a351,921 to \u00a3295,763, or upwards of five-fold, and the number of vessels cleared from 16 (tonnage, 8681) to 146 (tonnage, 199,497). The chief trade is with other Indian ports.\n\nFalta.\u2014Village in the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal; situated on the H\u00fagli, nearly opposite its point of junction with the D\u00e1modar. Lat. 22\u00b0 18' N., long. 88\u00b0 10' E. The site of an old Dutch factory, and also noted as the place of retreat of the English fleet on the capture of Calcutta by Sur\u00e1j-ud-daul\u00e1. A small fort has been constructed within the last few years at Falta opposite the mouth of the D\u00e1modar. It is surrounded by a moat fifty feet broad, within which is a mud wall.\ntwelve or fourteen feet high, with a top width of about ten feet, and with a slope of two to one. Mounted with eight guns.\n\n**Faradnagar.**\u2014Village in No\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed District, Bengal, and headquarters of the Phen\u00ed Sub-division; situated in lat. $22^\\circ 57'$ N., and long. $91^\\circ 30' 15''$ E., near the Grand Trunk Road, 2 miles north of the Big Phen\u00ed gh\u00e1t at Bhurbhuri\u00e1.\n\n**Farah.**\u2014Town in Agra tahsil, Muttra (Mathur\u00e1) District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. $27^\\circ 19'$ N., and long. $77^\\circ 49'$ E., on the route from Agra to Muttra (22 miles north-west of the former, and 13 miles south-east of the latter), a mile from the right bank of the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1). Population (1881) 3642, namely, 2448 males and 1194 females. Well supplied with water. Small b\u00e1z\u00e1r and police station. Formerly the seat of a tahsil in Agra District, which has been abolished, and the area divided between Agra and Muttra Districts. For police and conservancy purposes a small municipal income in the shape of a house-tax is raised under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856.\n\n**Fard\u00e1pur.**\u2014Village in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory, Deccan, 4 miles from the Ajant\u00e1 pass; the site of a travellers\u2019 bungalow used by visitors to the Ajant\u00e1 caves.\n\n**Far\u00edd\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Town and municipality in Ballabhgarh tahsil, Delhi District, Punjab; $16\\frac{1}{2}$ miles south of Delhi. Lat. $28^\\circ 25'$ N., long. $77^\\circ 21' 45''$ E. Population (1881) 7427, namely, Hindus, 5367; Muhammadans, 1988; Sikhs, 5; and \u2018others,\u2019 67; number of houses, 923. Municipal income in 1881\u201382, \u00a3386, or 1s. 6\u00bdd. per head of the population. The town formed part of the estate held by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ballabhgarh, but was confiscated with the rest of his possessions after the Mutiny of 1857. It was founded in 1605 A.D., during the reign of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, by one Shaikh Far\u00edd, from whom it takes its name. The main b\u00e1z\u00e1r is a fairly broad street, with houses of brick on each side; but with this exception, the buildings are of mud and mean in appearance. Police station, school-house, sar\u00e1i, and dispensary. Little trade, no manufactures.\n\n**Far\u00eddkot.**\u2014One of the Sikh cis-Sutlej States, under the political superintendence of the Punjab Government; lying between $30^\\circ 13' 30''$ and $30^\\circ 50'$ N. lat., and between $74^\\circ 31'$ and $75^\\circ 5'$ E. long., southeast of Firozpur (Ferozepur) District, and north-west of Pati\u00e1la. It consists of two portions, Far\u00eddkot proper and Kot-Kap\u00fara. Area of the State, 612 square miles, with 168 villages and 10,031 houses. Population (1881) 97,034, namely, males 53,848, and females 43,186; average density, 158 persons per square mile; persons per village, 578. The population consists mainly of Sikhs, who numbered 40,187 in 1881; Hindus, 27,463; Jains, 349; and Muhammadans, 29,035. The chief of the State is head of the Bar\u00e1r J\u00e1t tribe. One of his\nancestors, named Bhallan, in the time of the Emperor Akbar, laid the foundation of the greatness of his house. His nephew built the fort of Kot-Kap\u00fara, and made himself an independent ruler.\n\nEarly in the present century, the Kot-Kap\u00fara District was seized by Ranjit Singh, and in the following year Far\u00edd-kot was also taken; but when the British Government demanded from the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 the restitution of all his conquests made on the left bank of the Sutlej (Satlaj) during 1808 and 1809, Far\u00edd-kot was unwillingly resigned to its former possessors. The revenue of the State was at that time small and fluctuating. The country was entirely dependent on rain for cultivation, and this falls in small quantities, and in some years not at all. Wells were difficult to sink, and hardly repaid the labour of making them, the water being from 90 to 120 feet below the surface. On the outbreak of the Sikh war in 1845, the chief, Pah\u00e1r Singh, exerted himself in the English cause, and was raised to the rank of R\u00e1j\u00e1, and further rewarded by a grant of half the territory confiscated from the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1bha, his ancestral estate of Kot-Kap\u00fara being then restored to him. Waz\u00edr Singh, the son and successor of Pah\u00e1r Singh, served on the side of the British during the second Sikh war in 1849. In the Mutiny of 1857 he distinguished himself by seizing mutineers, guarding the Sutlej ferries, and attacking a notorious rebel, Sham D\u00e1s, whose village he destroyed. For these services, Waz\u00edr Singh was duly rewarded. He died in April 1874, and was succeeded by his son, Bikr\u00e1n Singh, the present (1883) R\u00e1j\u00e1, who was born in 1842. He holds his State under a sanad of 1863, by which the domain belongs for ever to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and his male heirs lawfully begotten. The right of adoption has also been accorded. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 has abandoned excise and transit duties in exchange for compensation. His estimated revenue is \u00a330,000 per annum. He is entitled to a salute of 11 guns. The military force consists of 200 cavalry, 600 infantry and police, and 3 field guns.\n\nFar\u00edd-kot.\u2014Chief town of Far\u00edd-kot State, Punjab, and residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1; situated 60 miles south-west of Ludhi\u00e1na town, in lat. 30\u00b0 40' N., and long. 74\u00b0 59' E. Population (1881) 6593, namely, Muhammadans, 3241; Hindus, 1862; Sikhs, 1226; and Jains, 264; number of houses, 1132.\n\nFar\u00edd-pur (Furredpore).\u2014District in the Dacca Division of the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, lying between 22\u00b0 47' 53\" and 23\u00b0 54' 55\" N. lat., and between 89\u00b0 21' 50\" and 90\u00b0 16' E. long. Bounded on the north and east by the Padm\u00e1 or main stream of the Ganges; on the west by the Gar\u00e1i, Bar\u00e1s\u00eda, and Madhumati rivers; and on the south by a line of swamps and the Naw\u00e1 Bhangni. The civil station and chief town of the District is Far\u00edd-pur town, on the bank of the Mar\u00e1 Padm\u00e1. Area, 2267 square miles; population (1881) 1,631,734.\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Faridpur District is essentially a fluvial creation, and exhibits the later stages in the formation of the Gangetic delta. In the north, the level is now comparatively well raised, and lies above water during the summer and cold weather months. But from the town of Faridpur the level gradually declines down the delta to the southward, until on the confines of Bakarganj District the country sinks into one vast swamp, never entirely dry, and in this tract all communication is carried on by means of boats. The soil changes from a light sandy loam in the north, to a comparatively recent alluvial deposit farther south. The highest levels, as in other deltaic Districts, are found along the river banks, being formed by the annual deposits from overflow. The lowest levels lie midway between the rivers, as such situations obtain less silt from overflows, and remain perennial swamps. The population clings to the higher levels; and the villages are chiefly built along the river banks, or on the margin of the swamps, surrounded with a picturesque jungle of bamboos, betel palms, and plantains. These villages or hamlets consist of mud huts, and often stand on artificially-raised sites, which, during the rainy season, rise from the universal expanse of water like wooded islets.\n\nThe District forms a tongue of land between two great rivers, the Ganges, or Padma as it is locally called, and the Madhumati, and is cut through by their innumerable distributaries and lines of swamps. The chief of these intersecting water-ways is the Arial Khan; and these large rivers, with the Barasi, are navigable throughout the year by large trading boats of four tons or a hundred maunds burthen. It is impossible to attempt a list of the streams navigable by boats of two tons burthen during the rainy season, as at this time of the year nearly the whole country is submerged, and boats of this or even greater size can ply over almost its whole surface. The numerous small watercourses or khals with which the District is intersected in every direction, and which dry up in the cold weather and the hot season, are all open for navigation during the rains. All the large rivers, but particularly the Ganges or Padma, are subject to constant alluvion and diluvion on an extensive scale, large islands or chars being constantly thrown up in one place, and washed away in another. Changes in the river channels are also constantly taking place. A local tradition exists that the Ganges or Padma formerly took a southerly direction at Salimpur, a village about 25 miles north of Faridpur town, and after running by Kanaiipur, flowed towards the east, and discharged itself into the present Padma, which was then but a narrow stream. The old channel has now silted up, and is known by the name of the Marai (or dead) Padma. The Padma, indeed, has now several channels, flowing between constantly-shifting sandbanks and islands; but it is impossible to give any idea of\nthe changes in these channels, sometimes one being navigable, and sometimes another. Similar changes on a considerable scale occur in the Chandn\u00e1. About fifty years ago, the b\u00e1z\u00e1r of Madhukh\u00e1l\u00ed was situated on the south bank of the river, when the stream suddenly changed its course, and began to flow past the south of the b\u00e1z\u00e1r. A subsequent alteration of channel has again removed the market-place to the south bank of the river. The village of B\u0101ikunthpur, which was formerly on the north bank of the Chandn\u00e1, is now situated on the south bank of that river. The banks of the rivers are generally shelving on one side, and high and abrupt on the other, according to the set of the current. The beds of the Padm\u00e1, Chandn\u00e1, Madhumat\u00ed, and Bar\u00e1sia are sandy; that of the Kum\u00e1r is of clay and a vegetable mould formed by a species of water-weed called p\u00e1t\u00e1 s\u00e1ola, which is used as a clarifier in the manufacture of sugar. The banks of the Far\u00eddpur rivers are for the most part cultivated, and dotted with numerous villages, sometimes extending in a continuous line for many miles. The alluvial islands (chars) in the Padm\u00e1 are generally covered with jungle on the Far\u00eddpur side of the river, but on the opposite bank they are cultivated and contain numerous densely-populated villages. The principal islands formed by the Ganges in its course along the northern boundary of Far\u00eddpur are\u2014Char Uj\u00e1n, area about 9179 acres; Char T\u00e9pr\u00e1k\u00e1nd\u00ed, about 5127 acres; Char Nas\u00edrpur, about 11,735 acres; and Char Bhadr\u00e1san, about 7340 acres. During the rainy season, not a single river in the District is fordable; but in the dry season there are numerous fords on the Chandn\u00e1 and Kum\u00e1r. The Padm\u00e1, Madhumat\u00ed, and Ari\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n are not fordable at any time of the year at any place within the limits of Far\u00eddpur District.\n\nThe marshes in the District are too numerous to be mentioned in detail, but the most important are\u2014(1) The Dhol Samudra, situated a short distance to the south-east of Far\u00eddpur town. During the height of the rains, this marsh expands into a lake, the water extending to near the houses of the town. At that time it is about eight miles in circumference, but gradually dwindles in the cold season, and in the hot weather is only a mile or two in circumference. (2) B\u00edl Pati\u00e1 in the south of Go\u00e1land\u00e1 Sub-division, about three miles in length by two in breadth; not navigable in the dry season. (3) B\u00edl H\u00e1thimohan, about two and a half miles in length by two in breadth; not navigable in the dry season. (4) B\u00edl Rankol\u00ed, about fifteen miles in length by six in breadth; not navigable in the dry season. It contains several villages within it, built on artificially-raised sites. (5) The Nas\u00edb Sh\u00e1hi marsh in Go\u00e1land\u00e1 Sub-division, about sixteen miles long and six broad, but like the others mentioned above, only navigable during the rains. It also contains artificially-raised villages within its limits.\nIn the southern part of the District, the marshes are too numerous to mention; and in fact the whole of the police circle (th\u00e1nd\u00e1) of Mak-s\u00fadpur is one vast swamp, with isolated strips of dry land during the dry season. Within this swamp are several artificially-raised mounds, inhabited by low-caste Chand\u00e1ls, who keep up communication from village to village, and often from house to house, by boat, for the greater part of the year. The largest marshes in the south of the District are the Mottar, Chandra, and Bakhshir bils.\n\nIn a fluvial District like Far\u00eddpur, numerous towns or trading marts are inhabited by a community living mainly by river traffic. The principal articles of river trade, which form the chief support of these towns or markets, are\u2014rice, tobacco, salt, cotton, oil, linseed, mustard, sugar, molasses, cloth, pulses, jute, onions, piece-goods, iron, tin, copper, coal tar, mustard oil, brass and copper manufactured utensils, and timber.\n\nFisheries are extensively carried on, and contribute in no small degree to the material wealth of the District. Fishermen from the neighbouring Districts of Dacca and Pabn\u00e1, as well as those resident in Far\u00eddpur, take annual leases of certain portions of the rivers for catching hils\u00e1, rohi, k\u00e1tl\u00e1, dh\u00e1in, p\u00e1ng\u00e1s, and other large fish, which yield them a considerable profit. In 1870, the annual value of the traffic carried on in the produce of the fisheries was estimated at \u00a320,000. With regard to the fisheries in the marshes in the southern part of the District, the following extract is taken from the Revenue Survey Report of Far\u00eddpur:\u2014\u2018These jhils, and the streams that traverse them, afford also an inexhaustible supply of various kinds of fish, crabs, and prawns to the various local markets. At certain seasons of the year, no small quantity of the fish is conveyed to the Calcutta and other markets along the canal or Sundarban routes, by which all the boat traffic is carried on between the eastern Districts and the metropolis. The fish in this case are stored in reservoirs constructed in the middle of the boat, and closed by a grating at bottom, through which a constant and fresh supply of water is afforded. The boats are well-manned and swift, and are pulled day and night. The fishermen cast the dead and dying fish overboard en route, and by these means keep a considerable percentage alive and in a fair condition for market.\u2019 As might be expected, fish forms a large part of the food of the people; and in certain seasons, when the supply of fish is unusually abundant, the lower classes may be said to almost live on this diet for months together.\n\nMarsh or river reclamation, with a view to the extension of cultivation, has never been practised in Faridpur. The marshes could be drained by artificial watercourses connecting them with the rivers, but the gain would probably not be commensurate with the\nheavy expenditure. Canes and reeds are largely produced in these marshes, and an extensive trade in mats and baskets manufactured from them is carried on throughout the District, chiefly by the Chand\u00e1ls, a low-caste of Hindus. The cutting of thatching grass and hogl\u00e1 (a broad-leaved flag) for roofs, etc., and the collection of mussels and snails for burning into lime, affords occupation to many of the poorer classes. Excellent clay is also found in many parts along the banks of the marshes and rivers, from which potters make the largest kind of earthen pots for packing fish and for holding grain and water, measuring ordinarily 4 or $4\\frac{1}{2}$ feet high by 9 or 10 feet in circumference. Long-stemmed rice is extensively cultivated in the marshes and swamps. The stem increases in length in proportion to the increase of the water; that is to say, it rises with the rise of the water, and ceases to grow as the water ceases to rise. This description of rice, of which twenty-four different varieties are cultivated in Far\u00eddpur, can be grown in water to a depth of 18 feet.\n\nNo mineral products, such as coal, metals, lime, or building stone are found. Pearls were formerly obtained from the Kum\u00e1r river; they were found in the shell of a species of mussel, and the shells after the extraction of the pearls were burnt and converted into lime. As late as 1867, the Collector reported that the pearl fishery on the Kum\u00e1r yielded about \u00a3400 or \u00a3500 a year. No revenue-yielding forests, or wild vegetable productions of marketable value, are found in Far\u00eddpur; nor any marketable jungle products (except a red powder called \u00e1b\u00edr, manufactured from the root of a wild plant called sati), or uncultivated pasture grounds. The larger sort of wild animals found in the District consist of buffaloes, leopards, and hog, the latter of which swarm in all the villages in the north-west and south of the country, and do considerable damage. In some parts, their depredations are such that the outlying lands of a village are unable to find cultivators from this cause. The villagers seldom destroy these animals, which are allowed to breed and multiply undisturbed. The smaller varieties of game consist of hares, wild geese and ducks, snipe, curlew, teal, quails, dove, green pigeon, etc. The fisheries have been already alluded to; and with this exception, the fauna does not contribute in any way towards the wealth of the District.\n\n**History.**\u2014The present District of Faridpur has been a gradual growth, arising out of the desire to bring the courts nearer to the people. Under Akbar's redistribution of Bengal (1582), Far\u00eddpur was included within the sark\u00e1r of Muhammad Ab\u00fad; and for the next two centuries remained exposed to the piratical incursions of the Maghs or Burmese from the seaboard, and of the Assamese, who sailed down the Brahmaputra from the north, ravaging the country on either side.\nDuring the first 46 years of British rule (1765-1811), it formed an outlying corner of the great Dacca District, under the name of Dacca Jal\u00e1lpur. As the head-quarters then lay at Dacca town, on the farther side of the Ganges, distinct courts were erected at Faridpur in 1811; and from this year the separate existence of the District dates. After various transfers and readjustments, Faridpur now forms a compact administrative entity, shut in between the Ganges on the east and the Madhumat\u00ed on the west.\n\nPopulation, etc.\u2014No accurate returns of the population exist before the Census of 1872. Since that year, the Sub-division of M\u00e1g\u00e1ripur, excepting Gaurnadi th\u00e1n\u00e1, has been transferred from B\u00e1karganj District to Faridpur, increasing the area of Faridpur to 2267 square miles. Allowing for these transfers, the area comprising the present District contained in 1872 a total of 1,502,436 inhabitants. In 1881, 1,631,734 persons were enumerated, showing an increase of 129,298 persons, or 8\u00b76 per cent., in nine years. The general results arrived at by the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 2267 square miles; number of towns and villages, 4655; number of houses, 228,444, of which 224,134 were occupied and 4310 unoccupied. The population numbered 1,631,734, namely, 805,989 males and 825,745 females; proportion of males in total population, 49\u00b74 per cent.; average density of population, 719\u00b778 persons per square mile; number of villages per square mile, 2\u00b705; persons per village, 349; houses per square mile, 101; inmates per house, 7\u00b728. The two most densely-populated police divisions (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) in 1881 were Sibchar, in the newly-acquired M\u00e1g\u00e1ripur Sub-division, with a density of 959; and Bh\u00e1ng\u00e1, in the head-quarters Sub-division, with 939 per square mile. Classified according to religion, the population was returned as follows:\u2014Muhammadans, 974,983, or 60 per cent.; Hindus, 653,992, or 40 per cent.; Christians, 2741; Buddhists, 13; and Brahmos, 5.\n\nThe Muhammadans are divided into the two classes of Sunnis and Shi\u00e1s, of whom the former in 1881 numbered 965,254, and the latter 7018, while 2711 were returned as unspecified. The Musalm\u00e1n population is proportionately most numerous in the north of the District, and the great majority are employed in agricultural pursuits. A few are traders, dealing in jute and hides.\n\nDaulatpur village, in this District, was the birthplace of H\u00e1j\u00ed Sharit-ull\u00e1, the founder of the Far\u00e1\u00edzi or reformed sect of Muhammadans, which has rapidly spread throughout the whole of Eastern Bengal during the past fifty years. The Far\u00e1\u00edz\u00eds are properly a branch of the great Sunn\u00ed division, and in matters of law and speculative theology they profess to belong to the school of Ab\u00fa Hanifa, one of the four authoritative commentators on the Kur\u00e1n. Their essential point of\ndifference from the general body of Su\u1e47nis consists in their rejection of traditional custom. They declare that the Kur\u00e1n is the complete guide to spiritual life; and they therefore call themselves Far\u00e1iz\u00eds or followers of the fard\u00edz (plural of the Arabic word farz), the divine ordinances of God alone. Historically, they represent a Puritan reaction against the corrupt condition into which Isl\u00e1m had fallen in Bengal at the close of the last century, and in this as in other respects bear an analogy to the Wah\u00e1b\u00eds of Arabia. There can be no doubt that the vast majority of Musalm\u00e1ns in the delta of the Ganges and Brahmaputra are descendants of the aborigines, who willingly embraced Isl\u00e1m at the time of the Muhammadan conquest, in preference to remaining outcasts beyond the pale of exclusive Hinduism. But though they became converts in outward profession, they still retained many of the superstitious ceremonies of their former life, and joined in social merry-makings with their fellow-villagers. The reform inaugurated by Haji Sharit-ull\u00e1 was a protest against such pagan practices, and a return to the simple habits and pure monotheism of the Kur\u00e1n. In especial, he objected to the squandering of large sums of money on marriage festivities, and to the exclusive employment of certain persons to perform the rite of circumcision. The articles of faith on which he chiefly insisted were the duty of the holy war (jih\u00e1d), the sinfulness of infidelity (kufr), of introducing rites and ceremonies into worship (bidd\u00e1t), and of giving partners to the One God (shirk). Externally, a Far\u00e1iz\u00ed may be known by the fashion of wrapping his dhut\u00ed or waistcloth round his loins without crossing it between his legs, so as to avoid any resemblance to a Christian\u2019s trousers, and by his ostentatious mode of offering prayers with peculiar genuflexions in public. The rapid spread of the Far\u00e1iz\u00ed movement in the lifetime of its founder affords sufficient justification for his enthusiasm. On his death, his followers met together and elected his son, Dudu Miy\u00e1n, as their spiritual chief. This man appears to have abused the implicit confidence imposed in him. He was charged with having applied the subscriptions to his own use, and with many tyrannical acts. On more than one occasion he was sentenced to terms of imprisonment by the British courts, and he finally died in obscurity at Dacca in 1862. He left no direct successor, but three of his sons, together with a nephew, set themselves up as leaders. Two of the sons are now (1883) living, and maintain themselves in that profession. At the present day the Far\u00e1iz\u00eds do not exhibit any active fanaticism, nor would it be just to accuse them, as a class, of disloyalty to the British Government. The majority of them are cultivators of the soil, but not a few occupy the rank of traders, being especially active in the export of hides. All alike are characterised by strictness of morals, religious fervour, and faithful promotion of the common interests of the sect. They are, however, intolerant and bigoted, and their contempt\nfor the opinion of others has been the cause of frequent affrays and disturbances, which have brought them under the notice of the authorities.\n\nThe Hindus number 653,992, or 40 per cent. of the District population. The following list exhibits the principal Hindu castes having upwards of 5000 members:\u2014Br\u00e1hman, priests, landholders, and Government officials, 46,915 in number; Baniy\u00e1, traders, 8700; Barh\u00e1i, carpenters, 5273; Baru\u00ed, growers of p\u00e1n or betel leaf, 8201; Chand\u00e1l, a semi-aboriginal caste or tribe, principally inhabiting the swamps and marshes in the south, and the most numerous caste in the District, 244,923. A separate account of this people will be found below. Dhob\u00ed, washermen, 9827; Go\u00e1l\u00e1, cowherds and milkmen, 6316; Jaliy\u00e1, fishermen, 28,607; Kaibartt\u00e1, fishermen and cultivators, 24,010; Loh\u00e1r, blacksmiths, 9550; Kap\u00e1li, weavers, 12,189; K\u00e1yasth, clerks, landholders, and Government officials, the second most numerous caste in the District, 84,193; Kumbhar, potters, 10,783; N\u00e1pit, barbers, 19,165; S\u00fadra, cultivators, 15,109; Sunr\u00ed, wine-sellers and merchants, 34,491; Teli, oil-sellers and merchants, 12,994. Aboriginal tribes who have embraced Hinduism, chiefly Bun\u00e1s and Bhumijs, number 6552; and Vaishnavs and other Hindus who reject caste, 7672.\n\nThe Chand\u00e1ls, a race of Hinduized aborigines, referred to above as the most numerous caste in the District, number a million and a half in Lower Bengal, of whom considerably more than one-half are found in the Districts of the Dacca Division. They are doubtless one of those aboriginal races who embraced Hinduism, and, like the Kai-bartt\u00e1s, are mentioned in the sacred epics of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata and R\u00e1m\u00e1yana. They are semi-amphibious in their habits, and capable of enduring the extremity of exposure and fatigue. They are of a superior physical development to the mass of the population, and this is attributed, not to their being of a different race, but to their mode of life: inhabiting a river District, and constantly employed in rowing, the muscles of the arms and chest get more developed than in men who pass their days at the plough. From time immemorial, the Chand\u00e1ls have been despised by the upper-class Hindus, and a Br\u00e1hman thought himself defiled by even treading upon the shadow cast by the body of a Chand\u00e1l. A great part of them accordingly turned Musalm\u00e1ns under the Afgh\u00e1n and Mughal Governments, and the remainder are now endeavouring to push themselves forward to a comparatively respectable position in the Hindu social scale. A recent Collector of the District, about 1870, thus reported on this interesting race, which so largely peoples the dreary and unwholesome swamps in the south of Faridpur:\u2014'These Chand\u00e1ls believe themselves to have been once a complete Hindu community, consisting of all castes from Br\u00e1hmans downwards, who, on having the misfortune to be cursed in a\nbody by a vengeful Br\u00e1hman of great sanctity in Dacca, quitted their homes and emigrated in a body to the southern wastes of Faridpur, Jessor, and B\u00e1karganj. There, with great perseverance and toil, they raised in the centre of the swamps large hillocks from 12 to 20 feet in height, whereon they built their homesteads in the dry weather in order to preserve their cattle and goods during the inundations. Here they are located to the present day, cultivating the swamps with rice and jute, and carrying on the occupations of fishing and bird-catching, varied with mat and basket weaving, and the cutting of grass for thatching purposes and for the consumption of their cattle. In the rains the water rises over 10 feet, and leaves their artificial mounds like so many islands in a huge lake. Locomotion then becomes impossible except by boat; while they have to collect their cattle and keep them in their homesteads, feeding them on what fodder they may have stored up during the dry season, and on a grass which, like the rice, grows with the rise of the water, and in appearance very much resembles paddy. These cattle have often to remain for days standing above their bellies in water; and as their food has to be stored up for them in the homesteads, they are fed on the minimum amount necessary to support existence. Consequently, by the end of the rainy season, they are reduced to skeletons, and very many die in the meantime. It is this that renders it impossible to introduce a larger and less hardy description of cattle. However, notwithstanding all the difficulties this Chand\u00e1l community has to contend against, they are strongly attached to the home of their adoption, and resist all inducements to abandon it. Efforts have been made to transfer some of them to the Sundarbans, but without success. They prefer remaining in the region to which they have adapted themselves perseveringly and laboriously, where they are not likely to be envied in their lot, and where they can dwell together as a distinct community, with their own priests, castes, and traditions. Their occupations, and their enforced practice of going about in boats during a great portion of the year, have rendered the Chand\u00e1ls a hardy and muscular race.'\n\nOf the Christian Population, numbering 2741, natives of India numbered 2591; Eurasians, 74; Europeans and British-born subjects, 72; 'others,' 4. In religion, the great majority, 2416, belong to the Baptist persuasion, a branch of the Baptist Church in Australia having established missions in Faridpur town, and in some of the rural villages. The converts are chiefly Chand\u00e1ls, poor in circumstances, and are looked down upon by the other inhabitants. The Roman Catholic community numbered 68; the Church of Scotland, 88; Church of England and other Protestants, 108 members.\n\nDivision of the People into Town and Country.\u2014The population is entirely rural, the so-called urban population only amounting to 1\u00b791\nper cent. of the whole. Only four towns contain upwards of five thousand inhabitants, namely, MADARIPUR, 12,298; FARIDPUR, 10,263; GOALANDA, 8652; and KUTABPUR, 7458 inhabitants. Out of a total of 4655 villages, more than one-half, or 2514, were returned in the Census Report as containing less than two hundred inhabitants; 1401 from two to five hundred; 524 from five hundred to a thousand; 180 from one to two thousand; 22 from two to three thousand; 10 from three to five thousand; 2 from five to ten thousand; and 2 from ten to fifteen thousand inhabitants.\n\nThe Material Condition of the People, owing to the impetus which has been given to tillage, together with the increased price of produce, has much advanced of late. The cultivating classes, who form the great mass of the population, are visibly better off than in former years, and they are gradually acquiring a taste for what may be called luxuries. Although about one-half of the cultivators are reported to be in debt, they are said to be able to live comfortably after paying the interest on their old standing loans. The middle class of people, however, who live on fixed salaries, do not fare so well, and the increased price of provisions has considerably straitened their circumstances. There is but little immigration into, and no emigration from the District. The Bun\u00e1s, who were formerly employed as labourers in the indigo factories, appear to have settled permanently in the District after the factories were closed. They do not amalgamate with the rest of the inhabitants; and although they live in the same towns and villages with them, build their houses close together in a quarter by themselves. In origin, they are immigrants from Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. Many persons annually proceed to Calcutta and elsewhere as boatmen and in other capacities, but almost invariably return to their homes. Many also leave the District during the harvest season as reapers, going principally to B\u00e1karganj. As regards occupation, the Census Report of 1881 divides the male population into six main classes, as follows:\u2014Class (1) Professional, including Government officials and professional men, 15,784; (2) domestic service, 9827; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, messengers, etc., 26,776; (4) agricultural class, including cultivators, gardeners, herdsmen, and others engaged about animals, 374,986; (5) manufacturing and industrial class, 53,987; (6) indefinite and unproductive (comprising 15,758 general labourers, and 308,871 male children and persons of no specified occupation), 324,629.\n\nAgriculture, etc.\u2014Staple products of the District:\u2014Rice, of four principal varieties, viz. \u00e1man (or winter rice), ai\u00eds (the autumn crop), boro (or rice grown on low or marshy ground), and r\u00e1\u00edd\u00e1. Of the four descriptions of rice, the two first-named are the more generally cultivated, and form the staple crop of the District; the two latter are\nalmost entirely consumed by the peasant who raises them. The \u00e1us and \u00e1man rice are sown broadcast, the seeds being generally intermixed, on lands neither too high nor too low. Where the \u00e1us is separately cultivated, it is generally planted in pretty high ground, in rotation with a crop of sugar-cane. \u00c1man rice grows luxuriantly in rather low ground where the rain-water collects. The best qualities of \u00e1man rice are transplanted from nurseries into carefully-prepared land, which, by repeated ploughings early in the rains, is worked into a field of knee-deep mud. This rice is always kept for sale, the cultivator using the coarser varieties for his own consumption.\n\nThe \u00e1man rice is of two genera, the baran and chhotn\u00e1,\u2014the former comprising 23, and the latter 13 distinct varieties. Of these species, the baran is regarded by the Hindus as sacred, while the chhotn\u00e1 is not; and a Sanskrit couplet (sloka) is quoted from the S\u00e1stras containing a precept to avoid the use of this rice on account of its ripening before the setting in of the cold weather. The baran \u00e1man is sown in March, April, and May, and reaped from November to January. The impure chhotn\u00e1 \u00e1man is sown broadcast in moist lands in March, April, and May, and reaped in October and November. The \u00e1us rice consists of 27 different varieties, sown between March and May, and reaped between June and August. Boro rice consists of 5, and r\u00e1\u00edd\u00e1 of 4 varieties; both are sown in marshy lands from October to December, afterwards transplanted, and harvested in March, April, and May. All the rice sown in high lands and in shallow water is cut close to the ground when ripe, so as to leave as little stubble as possible, and to save all the straw for the cattle. In deep water, however, only the ears are cut off; the stems remain in the fields till the water subsides, when they are either burnt for manure, or collected for household fuel, or for thatching purposes.\n\nThe other crops comprise\u2014wheat, barley, oats, maize, pulses, tubers, oil-seeds, fibres, sugar-cane, date-palm, indigo, p\u00e1n, safflower, fruits, and tobacco. About one-half the area of the District is under cultivation. Good land in Far\u00eddpur yields 22 cwt. of \u00e1man paddy per acre, and rents at 12s.; the highest rent paid is 24s. an acre. From 10 to 12 acres are considered a fair-sized holding for a peasant family. Much land is held on the maur\u00fasi tenure\u2014a lease in perpetuity, conveying rights of inheritance and transfer upon the cultivator, and not liable to enhancement of rent. Haw\u00e1l\u00e1 (h\u00e1ol\u00e1) and nim-haw\u00e1l\u00e1 tenures, of a similar character, are also common in this District.\n\nThe cultivators, as a rule, are well off, as about 75 per cent. of them have \u2018occupancy\u2019 rights in their holdings. The cattle and implements required for \u2018a plough of land,\u2019 or a holding of 5 acres, represent a capital of about \u00a34, 10s.; a peasant family can live respectably on \u00a31\na month. Wages and prices have risen greatly of late years. In 1855, day-labourers received 2\u00bdd. to 3d. per diem\u2014in 1883, from 4\u00bdd. to 7\u00bdd.; carpenters in 1855, 12s. to 16s. a month\u2014in 1883, \u00a31 to \u00a31, 8s. The price of common rice rose from 2s. 8d. per cwt. in 1860 to 3s. 6d. in 1870, and 4s. in 1883; and other staples in proportion. The cultivators do much of their ploughing and reaping by a system of 'mutual assistance' or g\u00e1ti. The following extract from the History and Statistics of the Dacca Division (Faridpur section, p. 197) explains the system pursued for obtaining assistance in tillage:\u2014'In ploughing and weeding, a cultivator has generally to procure extra hands; for this, however, no payment is tendered, as the person so assisted repays the debt by working himself for those who helped him. Sometimes a certain number of ploughs are engaged and paid for, but this is not usually the case. Those who do not labour at the plough themselves employ this kind of labour, or else hire farm-servants, who are paid by monthly wages. The reaping is generally done by labourers, who are paid out of the produce. The general agreement seems to be, that the labourer takes for himself one bundle out of every five or six reaped by him.' Another mode of getting assistance for agricultural purposes was formerly sometimes resorted to. When a cultivator required extra hands for ploughing or weeding, he had only to promise a good dinner and he was sure of getting as many men as he needed. This system, however, has fallen into disuse, as the return on the labour thus obtained hardly compensated for the expenses incurred in providing a substantial dinner. No class of day-labourers exists in Faridpur, neither possessing nor renting land. The higher class of husbandmen generally engage servants, who cultivate their fields, as well as perform other work, and who are paid by monthly wages. Most of the servants of this class, however, have lands of their own, which, during their absence, are cultivated by their brothers or other relatives. Children are largely employed in the fields, but not women.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Partial blights occur nearly every year, being chiefly caused by insects and worms. Floods occur annually on a more or less destructive scale, and are due to the rising of the rivers Padma, Garai, and Chandna before they enter Faridpur. The waters spread over the whole District, but seldom cause a general failure of the crops; they did so, however, in 1824, 1838, and 1871. During the Bengal famine of 1866, there was no failure of the rice harvest in Faridpur itself, but the heavy price of grain told severely upon the people. It is stated that during that famine, when the price of rice was between 9 and 11 lbs. for a shilling during four months, men who in ordinary times would be considered in fair circumstances were gradually reduced to one meal a day, and the poorer classes were obliged to ask for a share of the meals of their more fortunate neighbours. The\ndistress, however, never reached such a pitch in Faridpur as to render relief operations on the part of Government needful. The country is not protected by embankments or other defensive works. Partial droughts occur at intervals, but no precautions are taken against them. The large landholders have not yet undertaken reclamation works with a view of draining the numerous swamps and marshes.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The most important manufacture of Faridpur, and the staple article of District trade, is sugar, prepared both from the juice of the date-tree and from the cane. Indigo was formerly manufactured to a considerable extent, but all the European factories are now, with one exception, closed. A fine matting called sital pati\u2014very cool to sleep on during the hot season\u2014is skilfully woven out of a peculiar wild grass. All the local manufactures are conducted by the workers on their own account, and in their own houses, excepting sugar, which is made by hired labourers on monthly wages. Chief articles of trade\u2014rice, pulses, oil-seeds, oil-cake, jute, sugar, molasses, tobacco, chillies, onions, cocoa-nuts, betel-nuts, gh\u00ed, salt, piece-goods, iron, spices, timber, mustard oil, fish, poultry, hides, mangoes, fruit, oranges, potatoes, honey, brass, bell-metal and copper utensils. Goalanda, at the confluence of the Ganges and Brahmaputra, is one of the principal river marts in Eastern Bengal, being the terminus of the railway and the point of departure of the Assam steamers. The chief seats of local trade are\u2014Madaripur, Bhanga, Gopalganj, Boalmari, Pangs\u00e1, Godarbazar, Sibchar, and Madhukhal\u00ed. The water-ways carry the entire traffic of the District. There are only four important lines of road in Faridpur\u2014viz. the Calcutta and Jessore road, from Faridpur town to Dhobaghata on the Barasi\u00e1, 19 miles in length, with a branch of 4 miles to Boalmari; the Belgachhi road, from Faridpur to Kalinagar, 16 miles in length; and the Talm\u00e1 road, from Faridpur to Talm\u00e1, 11 miles in length. These roads are often damaged by floods, and at times lie under water for many days. The Eastern Bengal Railway runs for 28 miles from west to east through the north of the District, having its terminus at Goalanda. A native association called the Suhrid Sabha, with its head-quarters at Calcutta, has a branch at Faridpur, and is fairly successful in promoting female education, holding examinations of zanana ladies and others, and granting rewards and certificates to those who reach a certain standard. There is also at Faridpur a flourishing joint-stock native banking company, called the 'Faridpur Loan Office, Limited,' believed to be the first institution of the kind in Eastern Bengal. The shares are at a high premium.\n\nAdministration, etc.\u2014Owing to changes in jurisdiction, it is impossible to show accurately the increase in the revenue of Faridpur. In 1850\u201351, the total revenue of the District was only \u00a310,229, of which \u00a34171 was derived from the land; in that year the total expenditure was\n\u00a38,374. By 1870-71, or within twenty years, the revenue had risen to \u00a358,868, of which \u00a327,321 came from the land, and \u00a311,980 from stamps; while the expenditure in the same period had grown to \u00a325,013. In 1882-83, after the transfer of the greater part of M\u0101d\u0101r\u012bpur Sub-division from B\u0101karganj, the total revenue, including local cesses, had increased to \u00a3104,662, of which \u00a355,224 was derived from the land, and \u00a329,385 from stamps; the expenditure in the same year being returned at \u00a330,000. The extent to which the sub-division of landed property has progressed may be inferred from the fact that in 1851 there were only 165 estates on the rent-roll, with an average payment of \u00a323, 1s. 0\u00bdd.; whereas in 1870 the number of estates was 2307, and the average payment \u00a311, 16s. 4d. In 1883, the number of estates was 5933; but this increase is due more to the transfer of small estates from neighbouring Districts, especially B\u0101karganj, than to the sub-division of original estates. The average payment from these 5933 estates in 1883 was \u00a39, 6s. 2d. In 1883, there were in the District 8 stipendiary magistrates' courts, 3 benches of magistrates, 9 revenue and 10 civil courts. The regular police force numbered 392 men of all ranks (including a river patrol of 8 men, with 4 boats), or 1 man to every 5\u00b778 square miles. This also includes the municipal police. The village watch was 2964 strong. The total police force, therefore, amounted to 3356 men. In 1882, the daily average number of prisoners in Far\u012bdpur jail was 313; total number admitted during the year, 1129. The hard-labour prisoners were chiefly employed in enlarging the jail buildings; some also in making bricks and bamboo or rattan articles, and in oil-pressing. Since the introduction of Sir George Campbell's reforms (1872), primary education has rapidly extended. Active measures are being taken to establish schools among the Chand\u0101ls. In 1882, there were 480 schools aided or inspected by Government, attended by about 14,500 pupils. This does not include private indigenous schools; and the Census Report of 1881 returned 27,404 boys and 568 girls as under instruction, besides 48,912 other males and 767 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. In 1881, the number of villages in Far\u012bdpur District was returned at 4655; average population, 349. There are two administrative Sub-divisions (Far\u012bdpur and Goaland\u0101), and 3 municipalities (Far\u012bdpur, Goaland\u0101, and Madaripur); total municipal income (1882-83), \u00a31388.\n\nMedical Aspects, etc.\u2014The climate of Far\u012bdpur is very damp; the rains often set in at the end of April, and by the end of June the greater part of the District is under water. Average annual rainfall for the ten years ending 1882, 70\u00b77 inches. Malarial fevers, cholera, and rheumatism are prevalent. There are dispensaries at Far\u012bdpur, Goaland\u0101, and M\u0101d\u0101r\u012bpur, at which 543 in-door and 10,138 out-door\npatients received medical relief in the year 1882.

Area, 860 square miles; number of villages, 1917; houses, 88,397. Population (1881) 620,545, namely, males 304,072, and females 316,473. Hindus numbered 239,449; Muhammadans, 380,555; Christians, 486; Br\u00e1hmos, 5. Average density of population, 721.5 persons per square mile; number of villages per square mile, 2.23; houses per square mile, 105; persons per village, 324; persons per house, 7. In 1882, the Sub-division contained 5 civil and 7 criminal courts. The regular District police consisted of a force of 212 men of all ranks; chaukid\u00e1rs or village watchmen numbered 1171.\n\n**Faridpur.**\u2014Chief town and civil station of Faridpur District, Bengal; situated on the west bank of the small river Mar\u00e1 Padm\u00e1, in lat. $23^\\circ 36' 25'' N.$, and long. $89^\\circ 53' 11'' E.$ Population (1881) 10,263, namely, Hindus, 5349; Muhammadans, 4856; and 'others,' 58; area of town site, 500 acres. To the south lies the Dhol Samudra, a freshwater lake, which affords ample drainage except in the height of the rains; water is scarce in the dry season, but otherwise wholesome. Municipal revenue (1882-83), \u00a3644; rate of municipal taxation, 1s. 3d. per head of population within municipal limits. In January, an annual agricultural exhibition is held; this show, first instituted in 1864, has of late much increased in importance, and has given a considerable impetus to the manufactures and agriculture of the District. The South Australian Baptist Mission has a branch in the town; and the Br\u00e1hma Sam\u00e1j was represented in 1883 by 20 followers. An anniversary Sam\u00e1j is held every year, which is largely attended both by Br\u00e1hm\u00e1s and orthodox Hindus.\n\n**Faridpur.**\u2014Southern tahsil of Bareilly (Bareli) District, North-Western Provinces, consisting of the single pargan\u00e1 of Faridpur. Area, 249 square miles, of which 177 are cultivated. Population (1881) 111,141, namely, males 60,254, and females 50,887. Hindus numbered 96,233; Muhammadans, 14,898; and 'others,' 10. Number of towns nd villages, 323. Land revenue, \u00a315,914; total Government\nrevenue, \u00a317,781; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a330,846; incidence of Government revenue per acre, 2s. 0\u00bcd. This tahsil is described as the most unproductive tract in the whole of Bareilly District, consisting for the most part of a plateau with light siliceous soil, undulating in places into gleaming sandy ridges which present the appearance of low hills. In years of abundant rainfall such soil often yields a good autumn crop. But as no facilities for irrigation exist, its produce in ordinary years hardly repays the labour of cultivation. Two tracts\u2014the basins of the R\u00e1mganga river along the western and south-western border of the tahsil, and of the B\u00e1gh\u00fal and Kail\u00e1s rivers, a wedge-shaped tract along the western border, with its apex in the centre of the tahsil\u2014are exceptions to the general sterility. In the former tract, the soil is a rich, deep loam, whose natural humidity renders irrigation superfluous, even in seasons of drought. The latter is composed of excellent loam and clay, and is watered both from dams on the rivers and from wells. The Bareilly branch of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway crosses the tahsil, with stations at Fatehganj East and Far\u00eddpur. Parallel to the railway runs the Rohilkhand Trunk Road. The only other road is the Bareilly-B\u00edsalpur line, which traverses the northern border. There are no important manufactures; and trade is confined chiefly to the sale of agricultural raw produce, the principal markets being at the towns of Far\u00eddpur, Tisua, and Fatehganj East. The tahsil or Sub-division contains 1 criminal court, with 3 th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police stations; strength of regular police, 38 men, besides 297 chaukid\u00e1rs or village watchmen.\n\nFar\u00eddpur.\u2014Chief village of Far\u00eddpur tahsil, Bareilly (Bareli) District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 28\u00b0 12' 17\" N., and long. 79\u00b0 4' 45\" E., on the route from Bareilly town to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, 14 miles south-east of the former. Population (1881) 5881, namely, Hindus, 3471; Muhammadans, 2402; and 'others,' 8. Area of town site, 95 acres. A small municipal revenue for police and conservancy purposes is raised under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856. The town is long and narrow, with few brick-built houses, but many well-built mud structures of the better class. It is a station on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. Market twice a week; no important manufactures. The public buildings consist of the usual tahs\u00edli or Sub-divisional offices, two sar\u00e1\u00eds (native inns), post-office, school, road bungalow, and several temples. A fine mango grove is situated near the village, and the surrounding country is well cultivated. Water and supplies are abundant, and a good encamping ground lies to the south, beside the Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur road. The town, which was formerly called Pura, was originally founded by some insurgent Katehriya R\u00e1jputs, who were expelled from Bareilly city in the middle of the 17th century. It derives its present name from one Shaikh Far\u00edd, a mendicant, or,\naccording to others, a governor who built a fort here in Rohill\u00e1 times, 1748\u201374.\n\n**Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d.** \u2014 District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces, lying between $26^\\circ 46' 31''$ and $27^\\circ 42' 51''$ N. lat., and between $79^\\circ 9' 59''$ and $80^\\circ 3' 59''$ E. long. Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d forms the south-eastern District of the Agra Division. It is bounded on the north by Bud\u00e1un and Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur; on the east by the Oudh District of Hardoi; on the south by Cawnpur and Etawah; and on the west by M\u00e1inpuri and Etah. Area, 1719 square miles. Population (1881) 907,608 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at Fatehg\u00e1rah; but Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, on the west bank of the Ganges, is the most populous town in the District.\n\n**Physical Aspects.** \u2014 The District of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d consists of an irregular strip of country in the middle Do\u00e1b, together with a small outlying tract on the left or eastern bank of the Ganges. The former portion presents the usual monotonous features of the great alluvial plain to which it belongs. Starting from the banks of the river, a belt of land, varying from a broad stretch of well-watered lowland to a mere strip of sand, is first encountered, bounded to the west by the high cliff which marks the ancient limit of the narrower Ganges valley. Above this cliff rises the general upland plain, divided into two main sections by the little stream of the K\u00e1li Nadi, and further intersected by the lesser watercourses of the Isan. Each of these minor divisions displays the same general characteristics, consisting of a narrow lowland belt along the banks of the boundary rivers, together with a central level of sandy soil (*bh\u00far*), rising by a series of ravines from the valley below, and culminating in a watershed of loamy earth, often accompanied by marshy lakes and wide expanses of the white saline efflorescence known as *\u00fasar*. The dorsal ridge of loam comprises, roughly speaking, the irrigated portion of the District, where wells can be sunk with little difficulty or expense, and cultivation lies in scattered patches, like green islands amongst the barren stretches of *\u00fasar*. The trans-Gangetic tract, on the other hand, consists entirely of lowland, scarcely ever rising above the level of the yearly inundations, and liable to a sterile deposit of sand after heavy rains. Much of the land is subject to erosion by the river; and the areas of the villages vary greatly from year to year, as the floods devour or cast up again the cultivable soil. The R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 passes through the extreme eastern angle, which it often overflows, forming large but temporary swamps. The whole District is uniformly though not thickly wooded, and the strip lying along the high bank of the Ganges, a poor and barren tract, has a comparatively large proportion of trees.\n\n**History.** \u2014 The District of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d possesses great antiquarian interest, owing to the presence within its boundaries of Kanauj, the\ncapital of a powerful Hindu kingdom in the earliest centuries of the Christian era. The city, however, was entirely transformed under Muhammadan rule, and the architectural remains in the present town and its neighbourhood are almost entirely Muhammadan. It lies on the left bank of the K\u00e1li Nadi, 4 miles from the modern bed of the Ganges, which once flowed close below its walls. Ruins of ancient buildings extend over the lands of five villages, and occupy a strip of land about four miles long and from one to two miles broad; but as their walls consisted entirely of brick, the foundations alone now remain. The relics are constantly used as a storehouse of building material, so that the traces of the ancient metropolis grow fainter day by day. The principal Hindu monument is the shrine of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Aj\u00e1i P\u00e1l, supposed to be the prince conquered by Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed, and killed in 1021 A.D. by the Chandel R\u00e1j\u00e1 of K\u00e1linjar. There are, however, some Muhammadan monuments which are much more conspicuous. The famous Gupta dynasty of Kanauj ruled over the whole upper basin of the Ganges for about six centuries, from 315 B.C. to 275 A.D. Their coins and other monuments are still found in considerable numbers over the whole of their wide domain, and have yielded a comparatively consistent chronology to the patient labours of Lassen, Rajendral\u00e1la Mitra, and English scholars. Tradition points to Th\u00e1kur colonists as the earliest Aryan settlers in the District, after the extermination of the Bhars, as the aboriginal inhabitants are here universally called. The tract south of the K\u00e1li Nadi was peopled by the celebrated J\u00e1i Ch\u00e1nd, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kanauj; but the northern angle passed into the hands of its present occupants some seven generations later, after the Musalm\u00e1n invaders had completed the overthrow of its early Tu\u00e1r possessors. We know nothing of the District, however, from authentic historical records, up to a comparatively modern period of Muhammadan rule. During the 18th century, the northern portion of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, together with many pargan\u00e1s now lying in Etah and M\u00e1inpuri, constituted the j\u00e1g\u00edr of the Naw\u00e1b of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d; while the southern region was administered by deputies sent from Lucknow. In 1751, on the death of \u00c1l\u00ed Muhammed, the Rohill\u00e1 chief (see Bareilly District), the Emperor refused to acknowledge H\u00e1fiz Rahmat Kh\u00e1n as his successor, and despatched the Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d Naw\u00e1b to reduce that turbulent leader to order. Rahmat Kh\u00e1n, however, defeated and slew the imperial lieutenant, four of whose pargan\u00e1s in Bud\u00e1un he proceeded to annex. Safdar Jang, Waz\u00edr of Oudh, thereupon plundered the defenceless territories of the Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d Naw\u00e1b; but his interposition led to a union between the Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d Rohill\u00e1s and their Bareilly (Bareli) clansmen, under the leadership of H\u00e1fiz Rahmat Kh\u00e1n. The allied forces defeated Safdar Jang, re-took Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, and laid siege to Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d; while another body invaded Oudh\nitself. But Safdar Jang called in the aid of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, defeated the Rohill\u00e1s at Bisauli, near Aonl\u00e1, and once more recovered Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d. His successor, Shuj\u00e1-ud-daul\u00e1, conquered all Rohilkhand in 1774, with the aid of an English force, granted by Warren Hastings; and the whole country remained in his hands until its cession to the British in 1801.\n\nFrom the period of its passage under a firm and regular Government, the District remained free from historical events up to the date of the Mutiny. News of the outbreak at Meerut (Merath) reached Fatehgarh on the 14th of May 1857; and another week brought tidings of its spread to Aligarh. The 10th Native Infantry showed symptoms of a mutinous spirit on the 29th of May; but it was not till the 3rd of June that a body of Oudh insurgents crossed the Ganges, and arranged for a rising on the following day. The European officials and residents abandoned Fatehgarh the same evening; but several of them returned to Fatehgarh a few days later, and remained till the 18th, when another outbreak occurred, and the rebels placed the Naw\u00e1b of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d on the throne. The 41st Native Infantry, from S\u00edt\u00e1pur, marched into Fatehgarh, and the Europeans began to strengthen the fort. On the 25th, the rebels attacked their position, which became untenable by the 4th July. The fort was then mined, and its defenders escaped in boats. The first Fatehgarh boat reached Cawnpur, where all its fugitives were murdered by the N\u00e1n\u00e1 on 10th July; the second boat was stopped 10 miles down the Ganges, and all in it were captured or killed except three. The Naw\u00e1b governed the District unopposed till the 23rd of October, when he was defeated by the British at Kanauj. Our troops passed on, however, and the Naw\u00e1b, with Bakht Kh\u00e1n of Bareilly, continued in the enjoyment of power until Christmas. On the 2nd of January 1858, our forces crossed the K\u00e1li Nadi, and took Fatehgarh next day. The Naw\u00e1b and Firoz Sh\u00e1h fled to Bareli. Brigadier Hope defeated the Bud\u00e1un rebels at Shams\u00e1b\u00e1d on the 18th of January, and Brigadier Seaton routed another body on the 7th of April. In May, a force of 3000 Bundelkhand insurgents crossed the District and besieged K\u00e1imganj; but they were soon driven off into the last rebel refuge, in Oudh, and order was not again disturbed.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, in common with the neighbouring Districts of Etah and Et\u00e1wah, appears to have now reached the stationary stage, and has indeed shown a decline of late years. In 1865, the population of the District (which then contained about 400 miles of area more than it does at present) was returned at 917,496. At the next Census, in 1872, on an area corresponding to the present District, the population was returned at 917,178; while in 1881 it had fallen to 907,608\u2014a decrease of 9570 since 1872. The results arrived at by the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area, 1719 square miles; number of towns and villages,\n1723; houses, 133,966. Total population, 907,608, namely, males 490,508, and females 417,100; proportion of males in total population, 54.0 per cent., a figure which suggests that the practice of female infanticide, formerly so common among the Rajput clans in Upper India, has not been entirely suppressed. Average density of population, 528 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 10; persons per village, 526; houses per square mile, 78; inmates per house, 6.7. Classified according to religion, the population is returned as follows:\u2014Hindus, 804,624, or 88.65 per cent. of the population; Muhammadans, 101,284, or 11.34 per cent.; Jains, 814; Sikhs, 66; and Christians, 826. Among Hindus, the Brahmins numbered 83,696 persons. The Rajputs, descendants of the original colonists, and still the leading landowners in the northern half of the District, were returned at 62,991 persons. South of the Kali Nadi, in the tract formerly subject to the Oudh Wazirs, the Rajput Thakurs were for the most part dispossessed by the severe fiscal exactions of the Lucknow court. The other principal castes and tribes, according to numerical superiority, but not to social rank, are the following:\u2014Chamar, the most numerous caste in the District, although the lowest in social estimation, 95,949; Kurmi, 93,983; Ahir, 87,080; Kachhi, 74,552; Lodhi, 32,027; Kahar, 31,173; Gaddia, 30,126; Baniya, 27,937; Kori, 17,425; Nai, 16,802; Tel, 16,424; Dhankar, 15,582; Kayasth, 14,454; Dhabhi, 12,509; Lohar, 11,747; Barhai, 10,814; Bhurji, 10,546; Kumbhar, 8292; Bangi, 7234; Sonar, 6019. The Muhammadans are divided according to sect into 99,395 Sunnis and 1889 Shiites. The Musalm\u00e1n population includes 1212 Rajputs and 19 Mewatis by race. The Christian community consists of 298 British-born and 69 other Europeans, 78 Eurasians, and 381 native converts.\n\nDivision into Town and Country.\u2014With the exception of 130,221 persons, residing in eight towns containing above 5000 inhabitants, the population is entirely rural. These eight towns are\u2014Farukhabad, the largest and most important town in the District, and the main centre of commerce and communications, population 62,437; Fatehgarh, the civil station and administrative head-quarters, 12,435; Kanauj, 16,646; Kaimganj, 10,443; Shamsabad, 8271; Chhibramau, 7990; Tirwa, 6220; and Taligram, 5779. Of the 1723 towns and villages, 565 contain less than two hundred inhabitants, 651 had from two to five hundred, 337 from five hundred to a thousand, 127 from one to two thousand, 26 from two to three thousand, 9 from three to five thousand, 4 from five to ten thousand, 2 from ten to fifteen thousand, 1 from fifteen to twenty thousand, and 1 upwards of fifty thousand. As regards occupation, the Census Report classifies the male population into the following six groups:\u2014(1) Professional, including civil and military and the learned professions, 6956; (2) domestic servants, inn\nand hotel keepers, etc., 1210; (3) commercial, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 10,479; (4) agricultural, including cultivators, gardeners, and sheep and cattle tenders, 216,157; (5) industrial, including manufacturers and artisans, 54,463; (6) indefinite and non-productive (comprising 35,907 general labourers, and 165,336 male children and persons of unspecified occupation), 201,243.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Out of a total area of 1719 square miles, all but 88 square miles pay Government revenue. Of the assessed area, thus amounting to 1630 square miles, 348 were uncultivable, 313 cultivable waste, and 969 actually under tillage in 1882-83. The usual agricultural seasons of the Do\u00e1b prevail throughout\u2014the khar\u00edf, or autumn crops, being sown in June and harvested in October or November; while the rabi, or spring crops, are sown in October or November and reaped in March or April. Rice, maize, b\u00e1jra, jo\u00e1r, and cotton, with the lentils (arhar and moth) grown among the last-mentioned three crops, form the staples of the autumn harvest, covering a total area in 1882-83 (including twice-cropped land) of 367,054 acres. Wheat and barley, with gram and peas either intermixed with them or grown separately, and opium, are the spring products. These covered (also including two-crop lands), 355,694 acres. Indigo forms the chief intermediate (or late hot-weather and early rainy season) harvest. The cultivation of potatoes has been introduced, especially in the neighbourhood of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d itself, and the smaller towns of K\u00e1imganj, Shams\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Chhibramau. In the villages near the city, the system of a triple crop (one of them potatoes) is in full working. The cultivation of sugar-cane gives rise to an exceptional rotation of crops. When the autumn harvest has been gathered in November, the land remains fallow, and undergoes frequent ploughings for the next sixteen months, and the cane is planted in the second following March. It is not cut till January or February of the second year. Cultivators with rights of occupancy have a fairly comfortable livelihood; tenants-at-will pay somewhat heavier rents and clear a smaller margin of profits. Occupancy tenants hold 64 per cent. of the whole cultivated area; and where the proprietors do not themselves till their lands, they obtain the best plots, which the landlords would otherwise have kept as homestead. The total adult male agricultural population, including field labourers, in 1881 was 215,418, cultivating an average of 3'04 acres each. The total population dependent on the soil, however, was 572,815, or 63'11 per cent. of the total District population, giving an average of 1'51 acre per head of the agricultural population. Government assessment, including rates and cesses, \u00a3145,812, or an average of 4s. 7\u00bed. per cultivated acre; amount of rent actually paid by the cultivators, \u00a3265,372, or an average of 8s. 1\u00bcd. per cultivated acre. The average rent rates per acre ruled as follows in 1877:\u2014Resident tenants, 7s. 1\u00bdd.; non-resident, 6s. 7d.;\nalthough for exceptionally poor lands, or for lands growing specially valuable crops, rents vary from 1s. to \u00a35 an acre. The principal land-owning tribes are the Th\u00e1kurs, Br\u00e1hmans, and Musalm\u00e1ns, who hold about 36, 20, and 21 per cent. of the District respectively. Coolies and unskilled town labourers receive 2\u00bdd. to 3\u00bdd. per diem; agricultural labourers, 2\u00bcd. to 3d.; bricklayers and carpenters, 6d. to 7\u00bdd. The prices-current of food-grains ruled as follows in 1882\u201383:\u2014Wheat, 6s. 3d. per cwt.; best rice, 16s. per cwt.; common rice, 7s. 4d. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 4s. 7d. per cwt.; b\u00e1jra, 4s. 9d. per cwt. These prices are considerably more than double of those which prevailed in 1803.\n\n**Natural Calamities.**\u2014The famines of 1770 and 1783 doubtless affected Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, as they did the whole of the North-Western Provinces, but the existing accounts are too scanty to admit of separate estimates for each District. In subsequent famines, Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d suffered severely in the four worst years, 1803\u201304, 1815\u201316, 1825\u201326, and 1837\u201338. The area affected by minor scarcities did not extend so far northward as to embrace the pargan\u00e1s then included under the present District; and the southern portion of the existing territory, originally incorporated with Cawnpur and Etawah, is believed to have been much more liable to dearth than the northern region; although the opening of the canal in the southern portion of the District, and other less intelligible causes, has rendered this tract comparatively safe in recent times of scarcity. In the disastrous season of 1837\u201338, Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d suffered with great severity, nearly one-fourth of the cultivated area being abandoned. In August 1837, relief measures were adopted, reaching their maximum in March 1838. The famine of 1860 was confined to the Upper Do\u00e1b and Rohilkhand, and scarcely affected this District, except by raising the price of grain. The last scarcity, in 1868\u201369, occasioned considerable distress in Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d for a short period, but the dearth rapidly passed away. Relief operations continued from February to October 1869.\n\n**Commerce and Trade.**\u2014The cereal crops produced in the District barely suffice for local needs, and no surplus for export exists; on the contrary, grain is largely imported from Oudh and Rohilkhand for the use of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d city. But potatoes and other products are largely exported. The receipts at the ferries and bridges have increased five-fold since 1844, a fact which shows how greatly more active the traffic of the District has become during the interval. The city of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d contains a few native banking establishments; but their operations do not extend to the villages of the District, where the professional money-lender and the zamind\u00e1r still retain the exclusive power of making cash advances, and keep a firm hold over the indebted peasantry. The prevalent rates of interest are from 18 to 37 per cent. on personal security, 6 to 15 per cent. on jewels or other pledges, and 10 to 24 per cent.\non mortgages of landed property. Fatehgarh town is noted for its manufacture of tents, and also for its gun-carriage factory, which since 1830 has been the sole depot for supplying the Bengal Army with gun-carriages and other vehicles required for garrison, field, and siege artillery. The principal manufactures of the District are sugar and indigo. Two European planters have between them thirteen indigo factories, and several minor concerns are worked by natives. Other manufactures include the weaving of cloth and chintz, and the extraction of saltpetre. The Grand Trunk Road formed till recently the chief connecting link between Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d and the surrounding country, keeping up the communication with the east and north-west; but in 1881, the Cawnpur-Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d light railway was opened, and this now forms the chief communication with the east. The same line is about to be extended to H\u00e1thras, and operations have (1883) been commenced. This line will be the chief route to the Panjab, Agra, Rohilkhand, and perhaps even Bombay. The District has been hitherto injuriously affected by its distance from the railway system. When the Grand Trunk Road and the river Ganges formed the main channels of commerce, the situation of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d admirably adapted it for the trade in which its merchants were chiefly engaged; but when the railway offered a new and better outlet for the produce of the North-West, the course of traffic deserted the city for towns more favourably situated on the modern route. The road into Rohilkhand crosses the Ganges at Fatehgarh, where a bridge of boats suffices for the requirements of traffic during the greater part of the year; but interruption is caused in the rains by the substitution of ferry-boats for a standing bridge. Internal communication is well maintained by an excellent system of unmetalled roads, while abundant feeders in every direction connect the various villages with each other and with the main thoroughfares.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District staff usually comprises a Collector-Magistrate, a Joint Magistrate, an Assistant and two Deputy Magistrates, besides the ordinary fiscal, medical, and constabulary officials. Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d is the head-quarters of a civil and sessions judge, whose jurisdiction is entirely confined to the District. The whole amount of revenue, imperial, municipal, and local, raised within the District in 1876, was \u00a3197,229, of which \u00a3124,673, or more than five-eighths, was derived from the land-tax. In 1882-83, the total imperial revenue was returned at \u00a3156,975, of which the land tax contributed \u00a3122,523. The cost of civil administration in the same year, as represented by the salaries of officials and police of all kinds, was \u00a334,043. The last land settlement was commenced in 1863, and completed in 1874; it resulted in an increase of revenue by \u00a312,127. Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d contains two places of confinement for criminals\u2014the central prison and the\nDistrict jail, both of which are situated within a short distance of Fatehgarh. The central jail had a daily average of 1078 prisoners in 1882, of whom 43 were females. The District jail contained in the same year a daily average of 340 prisoners, of whom 8 were females. The total strength of the District regular and municipal police force was 906 men; and the cost of their maintenance was \u00a38884, of which \u00a36479 was contributed from Provincial revenues, and \u00a32405 from municipal or local funds. There was also a rural or village police force of 2004 men, and a road patrol of 68 men, maintained at a cost of \u00a37500. These figures give an average of 1 policeman to every 0'57 square mile of area and every 305 of the population; while the cost of maintenance amounted to \u00a39, 10s. 7\u00bdd. per square mile and 4\u00bdd. per head. There are 15 imperial and 12 local post-offices; and there is a railway telegraph station at Fatehgarh. There were, in 1882, 166 Government inspected schools in the District, with a joint roll of 5319 pupils. There are also a number of private uninspected schools; and the Census Report of 1881 returned 6488 boys and 347 girls as under instruction, besides 20,169 males and 419 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. The city of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d has a zill\u00e1 school, and an Anglo-vernacular school is established at Fatehgarh. The District contains only one municipality, Fatehgarh-cum-Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d bears the reputation of being one of the healthiest Districts in the Do\u00e1b. The general elevation is considerable, the climate is dry, and the country possesses remarkable freedom from epidemics. The trans-Gangetic pargan\u00e1s, however, must be excepted as low-lying and damp. The annual mean temperature was 77\u00b0 F. in 1874; the lowest monthly mean being 58\u00b0 in January, and the highest 94\u00b0 in May. The observatory was closed in 1875. The cold weather begins later than in the Districts to the west, and lasts from about the end of October to the end of March. The hot weather lasts till the end of June or the beginning of July, when the rainy season sets in, which lasts till October. The average annual rainfall for a period of thirty-five years ending 1881 amounted to 29'5 inches; the maximum being 47'2 inches in 1867, and the minimum 12'1 inches in 1868 (the year of scarcity). In 1881 the rainfall was 27'5 inches, or 2 inches below the average. Fevers prevail in August and September. The total number of deaths recorded in 1882 was 25,389, or 31'3 per thousand of the population, of which 23,010 were owing to fevers. The average registered mortality for the five previous years was 37'55 per thousand. Four charitable dispensaries, at Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, Fatehgarh, Kaimganj, and M\u00edr\u00e1n-ki-Sar\u00e1i, afforded relief in 1883 to 36,915 persons, including 1438 in-door patients.

Area, 343 square miles, of which 222 are cultivated. With the exception of a small tract of 4\u00bd square miles, the whole tract lies in the bang\u00e1r or upland portion of the District, along the high cliff above the alluvial basin of the Ganges. Population (1881) 255,127, namely, Hindus, 218,253; Muhammadans, 35,917; Jains, 100; and \u2018others,\u2019 857. Land revenue, \u00a323,977; total Government revenue, \u00a328,350; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a329,528. The tahsil contained in 1883, 3 civil and 10 criminal courts (including the head-quarter courts); 5 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); 217 regular police, and 640 village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs).\n\nFarukh\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014City and municipality in Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces. Situated in lat. 27\u00b0 23' 35\" N., and long. 79\u00b0 36' 50\" E., two or three miles from the right or west bank of the Ganges, which formerly flowed under its walls; distant from Cawnpur 83 miles north-west, and from Et\u00e1wah 62 miles north-east. It is the terminus of the Cawnpur and Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d light railway, now (1883) being extended to H\u00e1thras. Population (1881) 62,437, namely, males 31,416, and females 31,021. Hindus numbered 42,133; Muhammadans, 18,172; Jains, 98; and Christians, 34. Area of town site, 1802 acres. The town forms a joint municipality with Fatehgarh, the civil station of the District in its immediate neighbourhood. Municipal income in 1882\u201383, \u00a35530, of which \u00a34877 was derived from octroi; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 3\u00bdd. per head of the population (74,872) within municipal limits. Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d is a handsome and well-built town, with many of its streets shaded by avenues of trees. It was founded about 1714 by Naw\u00e1b Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, and named after the Mughal Emperor Farukhsiyyar. A mud fort, once the residence of the Naw\u00e1bs of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, commands an extensive view of the Ganges valley. The trade of the town was formerly considerable, but it rapidly declined on the diversion of commerce by the opening of the East Indian Railway. Now that Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d itself is connected with the general railway system of India, it is hoped that commerce will revive, and there are already encouraging signs of improvement in this respect. Z\u00edl\u00e1 school; dispensary; headquarters at the adjacent civil station of Fatehgarh. For early history and Mutiny narrative, see Farukhabad District.\n\nFarukhnagar.\u2014Town and municipality in Gurg\u00e1on tahsil and\nDistrict, Punjab, situated in lat. $28^\\circ 25'$ N., and long. $76^\\circ 51'$ $30''$ E., in the midst of a sandy sterile tract in the north-west of the District near the Rohtak border, $1\\frac{1}{2}$ miles from the terminus of a branch of the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 State Railway. Population (1881) 8738, namely, Hindus, 5398; Muhammadans, 2950; Jains, 375; Sikhs, 6; and 'others,' 9; number of houses, 1215. In 1875, Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d contained a population of 10,594, and its recent falling off is attributable to a virulent epidemic fever in 1878-79. Municipal income (1882-83), \u00a3822, or an average incidence of 1s. 10\u00bd per head of the population; expenditure, \u00a3693. The town is octagonal in shape and surrounded by a high wall with four gates. It has two broad b\u00e1z\u00e1rs running at right angles to one another, well paved and drained, and flanked with good shops. The other streets and courts are narrow and crooked. The principal export is salt, produced by evaporation from the waters of saline wells in the neighbourhood; and the imports are unrefined sugar, grain, spices, and piece-goods. The salt trade was once considerable, but since the extension of railway communication has cheapened the superior salt from the S\u00e1mbhar lake, it has been on the decline. The chief buildings are the Delhi gate; the Shish m\u00e1hal or Naw\u00e1b's palace, in which are now located the municipal hall, rest-house, school, police station, and post-office; a fine mosque; large well with stone staircase to the water; and a dispensary.\n\nThe town was founded in 1713 in the reign of the Emperor Farukh-siyyar, after whom it was named, by a Baluch chief Dalel Kh\u00e1n, better known by his title of Faujd\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, the governor of the country. The family held possession of the country till 1757, when the place was conquered by the J\u00e1ts of Bhartpur. Twelve years afterwards it was recaptured by the grandson of Faujd\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n; and in 1803, when the British supremacy began, he was confirmed in his possessions and dignities. The family ruled till 1857, when the then Naw\u00e1b, Ahmad Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, was hanged for participation in the rebellion, and the estate was conferred on Tafuzzul Husain Kh\u00e1n, as a reward for good service during the Mutiny, and is still (1883) held by his son, Sur\u00e1j-ud-din Haidar, who holds the position of an honorary magistrate.\n\n**Fateh\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Town, municipality, and head-quarters of Fateh\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil, Hiss\u00e1r District, Punjab; distant from Hiss\u00e1r 30 miles north-west.

A third-class municipality; income (1882-83), \u00a3199; expenditure, \u00a3202. Founded by the Emperor Firoz Sh\u00e1h, and named after his son Fateh Kh\u00e1n. Held at the beginning of the present century by a Bhatti chieftain, Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n. North of the town runs a cut from the river Ghaggar, constructed by Firoz Sh\u00e1h, and still used for purposes of irrigation. Considerable manu-\nfacture of country cloth; export of grain and gh\u00ed to Bikaner (Bickaneer) and the B\u00e1gar territory; brisk trade in leather. Tahsil, police station, sar\u00e1i, staging bungalow, and dispensary.\n\n**Fateh\u00e1b\u00e1d.** \u2014 Tahsil of Agra District, North-Western Provinces, lying on the south bank of the river Jumna (Jamun\u00e1). Lat. 29\u00b0 15' to 29\u00b0 34' N.; long. 75\u00b0 16' to 75\u00b0 51' E. Area, 241 square miles, of which 163 are cultivated. Population (1881) 104,762, namely, males 56,835, and females 47,927. Hindus numbered 97,543; Muhammadans, 5962; Jains, 1244; and 'others,' 13. Number of villages, 161. The tahsil lies between the Jumna and Utangan rivers, and contains a large ravine area, with a considerable amount of low-lying sandy soil at the foot of the ravines along the rivers. Proceeding inland, the soil gradually changes as the higher lands are approached, and the greater part of the upland area is a good loam, light in places, but of average fertility. Land revenue, \u00a327,000; total Government revenue, \u00a336,873; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a342,885; incidence of Government revenue per acre, 3s. 6\u00bdd. In 1883, the tahsil contained 1 civil and 1 criminal court, with 4 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 44 men; village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 336.\n\n**Fateh\u00e1b\u00e1d.** \u2014 Town and head-quarters of Fateh\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil, Agra District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 27\u00b0 1' 30\" N., long. 78\u00b0 20' 30\" E., 21 miles south-east of Agra City. Population (1881) 4441. Tahsil, munshi, police station, post-office, boys' and girls' schools. The town has but little trade; small bi-weekly market. For police and conservancy purposes, a house-tax is levied under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856, which in 1881\u201382 yielded \u00a393. The town was originally named Zafrnagar, and was changed to Fateh\u00e1b\u00e1d by Aurangzeb, after his victory over his unfortunate brother D\u00e1r\u00e1, in 1658. The Emperor built a mosque here on the spot on which he rested after the battle, as well as a sar\u00e1i, now the tahsil, and a tank, which has now nearly silted up. He also planted a large grove to the south-east of the town, which still remains in tolerable preservation.\n\n**Fatehganj (East).** \u2014 Village and battle-field in Bareilly (Bareli) District, North-Western Provinces, lying in lat. 28\u00b0 4' N., and long. 79\u00b0 42' E., on the route from Bareilly to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, 23 miles south-east of the former town.

Lat. $27^\\circ 22' 55''$ N., long. $79^\\circ 40' 20''$ E. Population (1881) 12,435, namely, Hindus, 8728; Muhammadans, 3588; and Christians, 119; area, 383 acres. The military station of Fatehgarh dates from 1777, although the town did not pass into the possession of the British until 1802. Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d District having fallen under the power of the Oudh Wazirs, Fatehgarh formed an outpost against the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s; and the British brigade lent to the Naw\u00e1b Wazir was stationed at Fatehgarh in 1777. At the cession in 1802, Fatehgarh became the head-quarters of a Governor-General's Agent, and of the Board of Commissioners for the Ceded Provinces. Holkar attacked the fort of Fatehgarh in 1804, but was defeated and put to precipitate flight by the timely arrival of Lord Lake. From this time, nothing eventful occurred in the history of Fatehgarh until the outbreak of the Mutiny in 1857, in the course of which nearly the entire population of European blood in the station, upwards of 200 in number, were killed by the rebels. A few who sought flight early in June succeeded in reaching Cawnpur, only to be seized by the N\u00e1na and massacred. Those who remained behind, after sustaining a siege of upwards of a week, were forced to abandon the fort, which had been undermined by the rebels, and to betake themselves to the Ganges. On their way down the river, they were attacked by the rebels and villagers on both sides of the river. One boat reached Bith\u00far, where it was captured; the occupants were taken prisoners to Cawnpur, and subsequently massacred. Another boat grounded in the river the day after leaving Fatehgarh, and the passengers were shot down or drowned in their attempt to reach land. A number of the refugees were brought back to Fatehgarh, and after being kept in confinement for nearly three weeks, were shot or sabred on the parade ground. Their remains were cast into a well, over which has been built a memorial cross, with a memorial church near to it. Fatehgarh still forms a military station of the Meerut division of the Bengal army; the force usually stationed here consists of three companies of European, and two of Native infantry. A Government gun-carriage factory was established at Fatehgarh in 1818, which, since the abolition of the central factory at Cossipore (K\u00e1s\u00edpur), near Calcutta, in 1830, has been the sole depot for supplying the Bengal army with gun-carriages and other vehicles required for garrison, field, and siege artillery. The factory is superintended by an\nofficer of the Royal Artillery, assisted by a commissioned officer of the same corps, and six European overseers. The working establishment in 1883 consisted entirely of natives, the average number employed being about 625 daily. Two native Christian settlements are maintained at or near Fatehgarh, by the American Presbyterian Mission. The Mission dates from the great famine of 1837-38, and was established as an orphanage for children whose parents had died or had abandoned them. As the orphans grew up, houses were built, and lands assigned to them, till a village was formed, and afterwards a second establishment was set up at Burhpur. Many of the native Christians are employed as catechists, and others as domestic or public servants. But the bulk of the community support themselves by tilling the plots of land allotted to them, or by working in the tent factory. This industry was originally established by the Mission, and managed by it. Since the Mutiny, the native Christians have worked it independently, and for some years past as a flourishing Limited Incorporated Company. The Mission maintains a high school, and several elementary schools both for boys and girls in the neighbourhood of the station; also a mission church. Besides the usual public courts and offices, the other public buildings comprise the central prison, District jail, Government and mission high schools, police station, d\u00e1k bungalow, and 2 sar\u00e1\u00eds or native inns. Fatehgarh forms a joint municipality with Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d. Municipal income in 1882-83, \u00a35530, of which \u00a34877 was derived from octroi; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 3\u00bdd. per head of the population (74,872) within municipal limits.\n\n**Fatehgarh.**\u2014Town in Fatehgarh tahsil, Gurdaspur District, Punjab.

Since the sack of the town by Sindhia's troops in 1803, before Assaye, and the great famine of that year, Fatekhelda has fallen into decay; and a large extent of ground is covered with ruined habitations.\n\nFateh Panj\u00e1l.\u2014Mountain chain in Kashm\u00edr (Cashmere) State, Punjab, forming a segment of a circle, and bounding the Kashmir valley to the south.

Fatehpur forms a District of the Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d Division. It is bounded on the north by the Ganges, dividing it from R\u00e1i Bareli District in Oudh; on the west by Cawnpur; on the south by the Jumna, separating it from Ham\u00edrpur and B\u00e1nda Districts; and on the east by Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District. Area, 1639 square miles; population (1881) 683,745. The administrative head-quarters are at FATEHPUR TOWN.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Fatehpur forms a portion of the Do\u00e1b, or great alluvial plain between the Ganges and the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1), being only separated from their point of junction by a triangular tongue of land, which belongs to the adjoining District of ALLAHABAD. Its main features do not differ from those common to the whole monotonous level enclosed by the two great rivers of Upper India. It consists for the most part of a highly-cultivated plain, whose soil is composed of the loam, silt, and clay deposited in earlier periods by the drainage of the Him\u00e1layan slopes. The central portion presents the appearance of an unbroken level, only relieved in places by barren and sharply-defined \u00fasar plains, the saline efflorescence of which glistens like hoar-frost in the morning sun, or thickly studded in the\nneighbourhood of the villages with leafy groves of mango and mahua trees. A ridge of higher land, forming the watershed of the District, runs through it from east to west, at an average distance of 5 miles from the Ganges. The country is thus divided into two declivities \u2014 the one, only a few miles in breadth, sloping rapidly down toward the Ganges on the northern border; the other, with a stretch of some 15 or 20 miles, falling gradually southward till it ends in the wilder valley of the Jumna. The portions of these plains which abut on the two great rivers are seamed in every direction by deep ravines, especially on the banks of the Jumna and its tributary streams. In the extreme west of the District, three large watercourses may be considered to attain the dignity of rivers. The P\u00e1ndu flows northward into the Ganges; the Rind and the N\u00fan swell the waters of its great confluence. The tract enclosed between the Jumna and the two last-named streams is one tangled mass of ravines, whose scenery is often picturesque and varied. The main channels are fed by innumerable rivulets, each of which cuts its way through beds of nodular limestone into the central gorge; while the sides are clothed with matted jungle, in whose recesses lurk wild boars, wolves, and leopards. Shallow lakes (jhils) abound in the midland portion of the District, which is not drained by any considerable stream. They are generally temporary, being filled during the rains, and drying up in January or February. As long as the water stands in them, wild-fowl of every kind may be found in abundance; and during the hot weather nilgai and antelope take refuge in the dry beds, when driven by the harvest from their ordinary shelter among the standing crops. As a whole, the western region is the most cut up by ravines and covered with babul jungle; the central tract is more generally cultivated, though interspersed with frequent patches of useless \u00fasar; and the eastern slope, near the Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d border, is one unbroken reach of smiling and prosperous tillage.\n\nHistory.\u2014In the earliest times, Fatehpur was inhabited by the Bhils, a tribe of non-Aryan aborigines, one of whose kings is mentioned in the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana as the host of R\u00e1ma. At a later date, it appears to have formed part of the wide dominions ruled over by the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Argal, whose territories stretched from the borders of Kanauj to the gates of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. The Angal R\u00e1j\u00e1s fought against the Muhammadans as allies of the K\u00e1nauj R\u00e1j\u00e1. Even after the defeat of the latter, they held a more or less independent position until the time of Akbar, who for some shortcoming sent a force against the Angal R\u00e1j\u00e1. He was defeated and slain, and his forts and palaces razed to the ground. The estate then passed into the hands of the Th\u00e1kur R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Asothar, as revenue farmers on behalf of the Mughal government. Like the rest of the Do\u00e1b, it was overrun in 1194 A.D. by Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn Ghor\u00ed, and\nbecame thenceforth a portion of the Delhi kingdom. In 1376, the fief of Fatehpur was made over, with Kora in Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d and Mahoba in Ham\u00edrpur, to the care of a Viceroy known as the M\u00e1lik-ul-Shark. Order was successfully maintained by this officer during the terrible raids of Tim\u00far, and the country enjoyed comparative security throughout the troublous period which preceded the final establishment of Mughal rule. B\u00e1bar conquered the District about 1529; but it still remained a stronghold of the Path\u00e1n resistance, and was the centre of the reactionary movement under Sher Sh\u00e1h, by which Hum\u00e1y\u00fan was driven for a while from the newly-founded throne of his father. During the slow decline of the Delhi dynasty, Fatehpur was entrusted to the Governor of Oudh; but in 1736 it was overrun by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, on the invitation of Ajaju, a disaffected landholder of Kora. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s retained possession of the District until 1750, when it was wrested from them by the Path\u00e1ns of Fatehgarh. Three years later, Safdar Jang, the practically independent Waz\u00edr of Oudh, reconquered the country for his own benefit. In 1759, the Waz\u00edr threw off his nominal allegiance to Delhi, and was acknowledged by the British as a sovereign prince in 1765. By the treaty of that year, Fatehpur was handed over to the titular Emperor, Sh\u00e1h Alam; but when, in 1774, the Emperor threw himself into the hands of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, his eastern territories were considered to have escheated, and the British sold them for 50 l\u00e1khs of rupees to the Naw\u00e1b Waz\u00edr. As the Oudh Government was in a chronic state of arrears with regard to the payment of its stipulated tribute, a new arrangement was effected in 1801, by which the Naw\u00e1b ceded Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d and Kora to the English, in lieu of all outstanding claims. Fatehpur at first was divided between the Districts of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d and Cawnpur; but in 1814, a separate charge was erected at Bith\u00far on the Ganges, which was transferred eleven years later to Fatehpur. The benefits of settled government were nowhere more conspicuous than here. In 1798, the District was described as a waste, whose ruined towns bore lamentable marks of former prosperity. But some half-century later, it is spoken of as a boundless garden, in which fields of sugar-cane, cotton, poppy and cereals alternated with beautiful groves of mango or tamarind, overshading the village mosques and tanks. No event of interest occurred after the introduction of British rule, until the Mutiny of 1857. On the 6th of June, news of the Cawnpur outbreak arrived at the station. On the 8th, a treasure guard returning from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d proved mutinous; and next day the mob rose, burnt the houses, and plundered all the property of the European residents. The civil officers escaped to B\u00e1nda, except the Judge, who was murdered. On the 28th of June, the fourteen fugitives from Cawnpur landed at Shiur\u00e1jpur in this District, and were all killed but four, who escaped by swimming to the Oudh shore. The District\nremained in the hands of the rebels throughout the month; but on the 30th, General Neill sent off Major Renaud\u2019s column from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d to Cawnpur. On the 11th of July, General Havelock\u2019s force joined Renaud\u2019s at Khaga, and next day they defeated the rebels at Bilanda. They then attacked and shelled Fatehpur, drove out the rebels, and took possession of the place. On the 15th, Havelock advanced to Aung and drove the enemy back on the P\u00e1ndu Nadi. There a second battle was fought the same day, and the insurgents were driven out of the District in full flight on Cawnpur. We could not, however, retain possession of the District except just along the Grand Trunk Road; and order was not finally re-established till after the fall of Lucknow and the return of Lord Clyde\u2019s army to Cawnpur, when the Gwalior mutineers were finally driven off.\n\n**Population.**\u2014Fatehpur is one of the Districts where agriculture and population appear to have reached their utmost limits. In 1865, the Census showed a population of 681,953, being a steady increase upon previous returns in 1848 and 1853. In 1872, the Census gave a total population of 663,877, or a decrease of 17,176 persons in seven years. The last enumeration, in 1881, returned the population at 683,745, showing an increase of 19,868 over the returns for 1872, and leaving the population as regards numbers practically the same as in 1865. The results arrived at by the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 1638\u00b77 square miles; towns and villages, 1414; houses, 131,589. Total population, 683,745, namely, males 347,587, and females 336,158. From these data the following averages may be calculated:\u2014Persons per square mile, 417; villages per square mile, 0\u00b786; houses per square mile, 80; persons per village, 483; persons per house, 5\u00b72. As regards religious distinctions, Fatehpur, like the rest of the Do\u00e1b, remains essentially Hindu, in spite of its long subjection to a Muhammadan power. The Census of 1881 returned the Hindus at 609,380, or 89\u00b712 per cent., and the Muhammadians at 74,218, or 10\u00b785 per cent. of the population. The remaining population consisted of 88 Christians, 58 Jains, and 1 Sikh. The number of Br\u00e1hmans is 70,427, most of whom are landholders or domestic servants. A few, however, are to be found at Shiur\u00e1jpur and other places of pilgrimage along the Ganges, as superintendents of the religious bathing-places, priests in the temples, or guides and caterers for the pilgrims. The R\u00e1jputs number 44,715 persons. They are generally well-to-do landlords; but as cultivators, they are reputed quarrelsome and lazy, and they do not make good tenants. There are a few villages owned by K\u00e1yasth auction-purchasers, and tilled by Th\u00e1kur peasants, the former proprietors, in which it is said that the landlord dare not show his face from year to year, and that the agent can only collect the rents at great personal risk. Baniy\u00e1s number 21,586, engaged, as usual,\nin commercial pursuits. These three tribes form the upper and more prosperous classes. The remainder of the Hindus, numbering in all 472,652 persons, belong to the S\u00fadra or lower castes. As a rule they are darker, shorter, and more sparely-built than the higher castes, besides often betraying in their features other traces of aboriginal descent. The Kurmis, 39,806 in number, and K\u00e1chh\u00eds (28,229), are industrious and diligent tenants, the agricultural backbone of the District. They pay higher rents than any other tribes, and pay them easily. The Ah\u00edrs (59,399), Lodhis (46,609), and P\u00e1s\u00eds (29,451) are a turbulent and quarrelsome set, but sometimes make fair cultivators under Th\u00e1kur masters. It is from them that the criminal class is most frequently recruited; and they also furnish a large proportion of the village watchmen and protective servants. The Gar\u00e1riyas, who are shepherds and herdsmen, number 22,088; and the Mall\u00e1hs, boatmen and fishers, 23,297. Next to the Br\u00e1hmans, the most numerous caste in the District are the despised Cham\u00e1rs, the general labouring population, who only emerged from a state of semi-servitude under British rule. The Musalm\u00e1ns are found chiefly in the north-eastern portion of the District. As a rule, they are more prosperous and energetic than the Hindus, a large number being small zamind\u00e1rs, but in the towns many have been reduced to great poverty. In Tappa J\u00e1r pargan\u00e1 there is a considerable body of half-converted R\u00e1jputs, who still describe themselves by their caste title.\n\n**Division into Town and Country.**\u2014The population is entirely rural; in 1881 only three towns contained a population exceeding 5000, namely, Fatehpur, population 21,328; B\u0131ndki, 6698; and Jah\u00e1nabad, 5244. Of the 1414 villages and towns, 498 had less than two hundred inhabitants, 538 from two to five hundred, 224 from five hundred to a thousand, 107 from one to two thousand, 30 from two to three thousand, 14 from three to five thousand, and 3 upwards of five thousand. As regards occupation, the Census Report classifies the male population into six main groups as under:\u2014(1) Professional, including civil and military and the learned professions, 6808; (2) domestic servants, lodging-house keepers, etc., 914; (3) commercial, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 3878; (4) agricultural, including cultivators, gardeners, sheep and cattle tenders, etc., 161,131; (5) industrial, including manufacturers, artisans, etc., 42,603; (6) indefinite and non-productive (comprising 21,361 general labourers, and 110,892 male children and persons of unspecified occupation), 132,253.\n\n**Agriculture.**\u2014The District contains 879 square miles of cultivated land, and a very small margin of the available area now remains untilled. The ravine-clad country of the western pargan\u00e1s is of course incapable of cultivation, while a few \u00fasar plains break in upon the ploughed fields of the central portion; but the greater part of the soil\nis cultivated up to a very high point. The fertile black alluvial mould, known as m\u00e1r, occurs in several places along the Jumna, and there is a strip of similar deposit between the high and low water mark of the Ganges, on which the best crops of the District are raised. The harvests are those common to the whole Do\u00e1b. The khar\u00edf or autumn crops are sown after the first rains in June, and ripen in October or November. They consist of rice, cereals, and millets; jo\u00e1r and b\u00e1jra being the principal staples. Area under khar\u00edf crops in 1882\u201383, 256,179 acres. As soon as the rains are over and the water has drained off the land, the wheat, barley, gram, oats, peas, and other rabi crops are sown, about the end of October, and these ripen from March to May. Area under rabi crops in 1882\u201383, 291,619 acres. Autumn and spring harvests are not generally taken off the same lands within the twelve months; but if the autumn rice crop has been harvested early, the land may be made to produce a rabi crop as well. Manure and irrigation are both employed for the spring harvest, but are seldom applied to the khar\u00edf. The jhils or shallow lakes of the central pargan\u00e1s are of great value for purposes of irrigation. The rabi and the rice crops entirely depend upon them.\n\nIf the rainfall is scanty, the jhils are drained dry by the end of November, the cultivators working night and day in relays to raise the water by means of leathern baskets. There are no canals in the District, and all irrigation is effected by private agency. Irrigated area in 1882\u201383, 147,733 acres. Of a total area of 1368\u00b77 square miles, all but 1\u00b72 square mile are assessed for Government revenue. The total male adult agricultural population, including field labourers, was returned by the Census of 1881 at 158,317 persons, cultivating 563,392 acres, or an average of 3\u00b753 acres each. The total agricultural population, however, including women and children, numbers 447,116, or 65\u00b739 per cent. of the District population. Total Government assessment, including rates and cesses, \u00a3153,911, or an average of 5s. 5\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total rent paid by cultivators, \u00a3220,083, or 7s. 9\u00bed. per cultivated acre. The condition of the peasantry is far from comfortable, and indebtedness is still their almost universal state. The modes of tenure are those of the Province generally. The caste panch\u00e1yats have very much the character of guilds or trades-unions. The Kurmi and K\u00e1chhi cultivators in pargan\u00e1s Ekd\u00e1la and Dh\u00e1ta have been known to unite together to resist enhancement of their rents. They then pay a fixed rate per plough or per field towards a general defence fund, from which are defrayed the expenses of defending actions brought by zamind\u00e1rs. Blacksmiths, masons, and carpenters often enforce very strict labour rules among their communities; an artisan is not allowed to work for lower wages or longer hours than his fellows, and piece-\nwork is discouraged as much as possible. Wages ordinarily rule as follows:\u2014Coolies and unskilled labourers, \\(2\\frac{1}{4}\\)d. to \\(3\\frac{3}{4}\\)d. per diem; agricultural labourers, \\(2\\frac{1}{4}\\)d. to 3d.; bricklayers and carpenters, 6d. to 2s.; boys and girls get about one-half the wages of adults. The following were the average prices-current of food-grains in 1876:\u2014Wheat, \\(15\\frac{2}{3}\\) sers per rupee, or 7s. 3d. per cwt.; common rice, \\(18\\frac{1}{4}\\) sers per rupee, or 6s. 1d. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 30 sers per rupee, or 3s. 9d. per cwt.; b\u00e1jra, 28 sers per rupee, or 4s. per cwt.\n\n**Natural Calamities.**\u2014Fatehpur has not suffered so severely from drought of late years as many neighbouring Districts. Famines from this cause occurred in 1770, in 1783, and in 1837. In 1860, scarcely any rain fell in the Do\u00e1b, but the worst distress never reached its lower extremity, and Fatehpur escaped with comparative immunity. In 1864, although only 16 inches of rain fell, and the rice crops suffered greatly, there was no actual famine. In 1868 the rain, though more copious, was badly distributed, and with the exception of a single heavy downpour in September, none fell after the middle of July. The solitary shower, however, prevented the crops from utterly perishing; but the autumn harvest was very poor, and as the winter passed away without rain, it became evident that the spring crops would fail in all high places where the land could not be irrigated. In January 1869, relief works were started on a large scale in the southern pargan\u00e1s, and about 200 miles of raised roads were constructed. This gave employment to the starving poor till the spring crops were cut in April; and the worst pressure was thus relieved. There has been no severe distress in the District since that date, although in 1870 heavy floods did a great deal of damage to the autumn crops. The scarcity which prevailed throughout Northern India in 1877\u201378 did not reach famine point in Fatehpur District, although much distress was felt.\n\n**Commerce and Trade, etc.**\u2014The trade of the District is mainly in agricultural produce, and is concentrated in the towns of Fatehpur and Naraini. Bindki, however, is the great grain and cattle mart of the District, where dealers from Bundelkhand and the Do\u00e1b meet to exchange their produce. Most of the Bundelkhand grain is sent off from the Mauh\u00e1r railway station, 5 miles north of Bindki. Brass and copper work is turned out in considerable quantities at Khajuha and Kora; and the latter town has likewise some trade in whips and skins. Saltpetre is manufactured to a large extent in the northern portion of the District, from the saline deposits of the \u00fasar plains; a good deal of refined salt is also made, but only surreptitiously, as the manufacture is prohibited. The means of communication are ample. The East Indian Railway main line runs through the heart of the District, with five stations, and a total length within its boundaries of 55 miles. The Grand Trunk Road also traverses the District from side to side, with a\nlength of about 60 miles. Other excellent roads connect Fatehpur with Oudh, Bundelkhand, and the Doab generally. The Ganges and Jumna afford water communication along the whole northern and southern frontiers. They still carry a large part of the heavy traffic in cotton, grain, and stone, though of course the railway and the Grand Trunk Road have seriously diminished its dimensions. The only fair of any importance is that held at Shuir\u00e1jpur, on the Ganges, in the first week of November. Its object is primarily religious, but a good deal of business is transacted side by side with the bathing in the sacred river. From 20,000 to 50,000 people often attend it. Horses, cattle, whips, shoes, and toys are the chief articles sold.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District staff usually consists of a Collector-Magistrate, a Joint Magistrate, an Assistant, and an uncovenanted Deputy Collector. The whole amount of revenue\u2014imperial, municipal, and local\u2014raised in the District in 1876 was \u00a3165,409. In 1882\u201383, the imperial revenue of the District amounted to \u00a3137,874, of which \u00a3130,834 was derived from the land-tax. In the same year the regular and municipal police amounted to 482 men, and the cost of their maintenance to \u00a35487, of which \u00a34987 was defrayed from provincial funds, and the remainder from other sources. These figures give an average of 1 policeman to every 3.4 square miles and every 1419 of the population. The expenditure upon the force is equal to an average of \u00a33, 7s. 2\u00bdd. per square mile and 1\u00bed. per inhabitant. The regular police were supplemented by 1869 village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), maintained at a cost of \u00a36764. During 1882, the Fatehpur jail contained a daily average of 311 prisoners, of whom 293 were males and 18 females. The District contains 22 post-offices, of which 14 are imperial and 8 local. The Government has no telegraph station in Fatehpur, but there is a railway telegraph office at each station on the East Indian line. Education was carried on in this District in 1882\u201383 by 107 Government inspected schools, with 3845 scholars. Six of the schools are for girls. There are, however, several private schools uninspected by the educational officers; and the Census Report of 1881 returned 6082 boys and 121 girls as under instruction, besides 19,443 males and 155 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. For fiscal and administrative purposes, Fatehpur is subdivided into 6 tahsils, 13 pargan\u00e1s, and 20 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s). The District contains only one municipality\u2014Fatehpur town.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Fatehpur is that of an ordinary Do\u00e1b District; but from its easterly position, the west winds do not reach it with such force in the hot weather as they display at Agra and the adjoining towns. The surface is somewhat marshy, and the numerous shallow lakes (jh\u00edls) render the atmosphere damper than that of the Upper Do\u00e1b. The humidity of the climate makes it rather\nfeverish, but the natives do not consider it unhealthy, especially when compared with the malarious flats and valleys of Bundelkhand to the south. Europeans enjoy moderate health; and the once notorious head-quarters at Fatehpur have now been rendered safe by the drainage of a large swamp, which formerly stretched to the west of the station. During the winter months the climate is most enjoyable, but towards the end of March the weather gets rapidly hotter, and in June the thermometer often remains at $96^\\circ$ or $98^\\circ$ F. day and night. The maximum rainfall was $53.5$ inches in 1870, and the minimum was $16.3$ inches in 1864. The slight rainfall of the latter year was, however, so evenly distributed, that drought was not felt so severely as in 1868, when $18.6$ inches fell, but so irregularly as to cause a partial famine during the following winter. The average annual rainfall for a period of 33 years ending 1881 was $29.99$ inches. The rainfall in 1881 was $39.40$ inches, or $9.41$ inches above the average. The total number of deaths recorded in 1882 was $28,178$, or $41.35$ per thousand of the population. The mean ratio of recorded deaths per thousand during the previous five years was $33.15$ per thousand. There is one charitable dispensary in the District, at Fatehpur town; in 1882-83 it afforded relief to a total number of 5792 patients.

The town lays claim to considerable antiquity, and B\u00e1bar mentions it in his memoirs. The tomb of Naw\u00e1b Bakar Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, minister of the Oudh Naw\u00e1bs at the end of the last century, forms the chief architectural ornament of the principal street. The Jam\u00e1 Masj\u00edd,\nor great mosque, and the mosque of H\u00e1kim Abdul Hasan of Kora, also possess considerable interest. For the Mutiny narrative, see Fatehpur District. Station on the East Indian Railway main line. Telegraph office, District jail, administrative offices, charitable dispensary, high school. Trade in hides, soap, and grain. The only industry peculiar to the town, and that an unimportant one, is the manufacture of whips. Two vernacular newspapers are published here.\n\nFatehpur.\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division of Bara Banki District, Oudh; lying between $26^\\circ 58'$ and $27^\\circ 21'$ N. lat., and between $80^\\circ 58'$ and $81^\\circ 36'$ E. long; bounded on the north by Mahmud\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil of S\u00edt\u00e1pur, on the east by His\u00e1mpur tahsil of Bahr\u00e1\u00edch, on the south by Bara Banki tahsil, and on the west by Malih\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil of Lucknow.

The tahsil comprises the 6 pargan\u00e1s of Fatehpur, Kursi, Muhammadpur, Bhitauli, R\u00e1mnagar, and B\u00e1do Sar\u00e1i. It contains 1 civil and 1 criminal court and 4 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s).\n\nFatehpur.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Fatehpur tahsil, Bara Banki District, Oudh. The original seat of the Kh\u00e1nz\u00e1da family, to which the great tal\u00edkhd\u00e1rs of Mahmud\u00e1b\u00e1d, Bhatw\u00e1mau, and Bilahr\u00e1 belong; the Shaikhz\u00e1das of Fatehpur are connections of the family of the same name, once so powerful in Lucknow. The pargan\u00e1 is picturesquely situated on the high lands above the Gogra (Ghagr\u00e1), between Dewa on the north and Mahmud\u00e1b\u00e1d on the south. Area, 154 square miles, or 98,352 acres, of which 65,358 acres are cultivated and 13,186 are cultivable waste. Government land revenue, \u00a312,904; average incidence, 3s. 11\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated, or 3s. 3\u00bdd. per acre of assessed area. Population (1881) 92,969, namely, 48,524 males and 44,445 females. Average density of population, 609 persons per square mile.\n\nFatehpur.\u2014Town in Bara Banki District, Oudh; 15 miles north-north-east of the head-quarters town, at the junction of the Dary\u00e1b\u00e1d, R\u00e1mnagar, Bara Banki, and S\u00edt\u00e1pur roads. Lat. $27^\\circ 10' 15''$ N., long. $81^\\circ 15' 5''$ E. A place of considerable importance during the days of Mughal supremacy. Many large Muhammadan buildings exist, but all in a state of decay. The principal of these is an im\u00e1mb\u00e1r\u00e1, said to have been built by Maulvi Kar\u00e1mat Al\u00ed, an officer of high rank at the court of Nas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn Haidar, but now only used during the muharram festival. There is also an old masjid, said to have been built in the time of Akbar; the present owner of the ground attached to it holds under a sanad or deed of gift, purporting to have been granted by Akbar himself. There are also many Hindu temples. Besides a well-attended daily b\u00e1z\u00e1r, a special bi-weekly market is also held, the principal trade being in grain brought from the trans-Gogra tract, and in English cloth. Coarse country cloth is manufactured by a\nnumerous colony of weavers. Police station, revenue court, and well-attended Anglo-vernacular school.\n\n**Fatehpur.**\u2014Village in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. 22\u00b0 38' N., and long. 78\u00b0 34' E., on the outer slope of the low limestone hills which shut in the Denwa valley, and upon the road from B\u00e1nkher\u00ed to Pachmarhi. A line of semi-independent Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1s held the surrounding country from the days of the Mandl\u00e1 dynasty; and its present representatives still live at Fatehpur, and hold large estates in the neighbourhood. T\u00e1ntia Top\u00ed passed this way to the S\u00e1tpr\u00fc Hills in 1858.\n\n**Fatehpur.**\u2014Village in Hatta tahsil, Damoh District, Central Provinces. Population (1881) 2276, namely, Hindus, 2108; Muhammadans, 120; and Jains, 48.\n\n**Fatehpur.**\u2014Town in Shaikhaw\u00e1ti District, Jaipur State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Population (1881) 14,731, namely, Hindus, 10,561; Muhammadans, 3927; and 'unspecified,' 243. Situated 145 miles north-west from Jaipur. The town is fortified and belongs to the chiefship of S\u00edkar. Post-office.\n\n**Fatehpur Chaur\u00e1si.**\u2014P\u00e1rgan\u00e1 in Safipur tahsil, Un\u00e1o District, Oudh, lying along the banks of the Ganges, south of B\u00e1ngarmau, and north of Safipur p\u00e1rgan\u00e1; colonized about 250 years ago by Janw\u00e1r R\u00e1jputs, who ousted the aboriginal Thatheras. The last chief, who held the whole p\u00e1rgan\u00e1 as his estate, rebelled in the Mutiny of 1857. He seized the English fugitives who were escaping by boat from Fatehgarh, and delivered them up to the N\u00e1na, by whom they were massacred on the Cawnpur parade. He died from the effects of a wound received in an attack on Un\u00e1o; one of his sons was hanged, and the other fled. The family estates were confiscated and given to strangers. The p\u00e1rgan\u00e1 possesses varied scenery, being dotted with picturesque groves, and intersected by channels leading to the Ganges. Indian corn of the best description, and barley of a fair quality, are the principal crops. Area, 90 square miles, of which 49 are cultivated. Government land revenue, \u00a35418, or an average assessment of 1s. 10\u00bdd. per acre. Land is held under the different tenures as follows:\u2014T\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri, 25,966 acres; zamind\u00e1ri, 25,806 acres; pattid\u00e1ri, 5442 acres; and Government estates, 308 acres. Population (1881) 33,087, namely, males 17,853, and females 15,234.\n\n**Fatehpur Chaur\u00e1si.**\u2014Town in Safipur tahsil, Un\u00e1o District, Oudh; 6 miles west of Safipur, and 25 north-west of the head-quarters town. Said to have been held successively by the Thatheras, a colony of Sayyid emigrants, and the Janw\u00e1rs, each of whom ousted the previous holders by force. The estates of the last holder were confiscated for rebellion in 1857. Population (1881) 2948, namely, Hindus, 2619; and Muhammadans, 329. Six Hindu temples. Bi-weekly b\u00e1z\u00e1r, and small\nannual fair on the occasion of the Dasahara festival. Post-office, registration office, and village school.\n\nFatehpur Sikri.\u2014Tahsil of Agra District, North-Western Provinces, (also known as tahsil Kir\u00e1oli), lying in the western or trans-Jumna portion of the District. Area, 272 square miles, of which 189 square miles are cultivated, 62 square miles cultivable, and 21 square miles waste. Land revenue, \u00a329,789; total Government revenue, including local rates and cesses, \u00a333,423; rental paid by cultivators, including cesses, \u00a338,349. Population (1881) 114,678, namely, males 61,596, and females 53,082. Hindus numbered 101,861; Muhammadans, 11,989; Jains, 823; and \u2018others,\u2019 5. Number of towns and villages, 171. The tahsil is watered by the Utangan river in the south, and by the Khari nadi which flows through its centre. In the east the country is level, resembling the adjoining tract in the Agra tahsil. In the western half, however, there are hills, the most important being the range on which the town of Fatehpur Sikri is situated, running across the valley between the Utangan and Khari nadi in a north-easterly direction. A much shorter and lower range runs parallel to this on the north side of the Khari nadi; both ranges consist of red sandstone. The Muttra and Agra road crosses the north-east of the tahsil, but the most important road is the one from Agra, through the centre of the tahsil to Kir\u00e1oli, the head-quarters, and to Fatehpur Sikri, up to which point it is metalled. Thence it continues westwards, and is known as the Nas\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d road. This line of communication is connected by numerous village roads with all parts of the tahsil, which is thus brought into close connection with Agra city, distant only 10 miles from its eastern border. The R\u00e1jput\u00e1na State Railway runs through the northern half of the tahsil, within 4 miles of Kir\u00e1oli; and at Achhnera the branch line to Muttra strikes off. The Agra Canal passes through the north of the tahsil, and three distributaries irrigate the tract to the north of the Khari nadi. The tahsil or Sub-division contains 1 criminal court, with 4 police stations; strength of regular police, 54 men.\n\nFatehpur Sikri.\u2014Town, municipality, and a former capital of the Mughal Empire; situated in Agra District, North-Western Provinces, 23 miles west of Agra, and 10 miles south-west of Kir\u00e1oli. Lat. 27\u00b0 5' 35\" N., long. 77\u00b0 42' 18\" E. Population (1881) 6243, namely, Hindus, 3536; Muhammadans, 2706; and 1 Christian. Municipal income (1882-83), \u00a3426, of which \u00a3411 was derived from octroi; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 1d. per head (7466) of municipal population. Founded by the Emperor Akbar in 1570 with a view to its establishment as the permanent seat of the Mughal court; and enriched by magnificent architectural works in the time of Akbar and Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr; but abandoned within fifty years of its foundation, in\nfavour of Delhi. It chiefly consists of a vast expanse of ruins, enclosed by a high stone wall, some 5 miles in circuit. The great mosque is approached by a magnificent gateway, known as the Buland Darwaza, which surmounts a splendid flight of steps, and gives access to the Dargah or sacred quadrangle, a courtyard some 500 feet square, surrounded by a lofty cloister and a range of cells for Fakirs or pilgrims. The quadrangle contains a large mosque with three handsome domes of white marble, besides the tomb of Shaikh Salim Chishti, a Musalm\u00e1n ascetic, through whose intercession Akbar obtained an heir in the person of Prince Salim, afterwards known as the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. The tomb consists of an elaborately-carved shrine in white marble, enclosing a sarcophagus within a screen of lattice-work, inlaid with mother-of-pearl. North of the Dargah stand the houses of Ab\u00fal Fazl and his brother Fa\u00edz\u00ed, now used as a boys\u2019 school. Eastward is the principal palace, containing the apartments of Akbar\u2019s chief wife. It consists of a spacious courtyard, surrounded by a continuous gallery, from which rise rows of buildings on the north and south, roofed with slabs of blue enamel. A lofty and richly-carved gate gives access to a terrace paved with sandstone flags, and formerly enclosed by a colonnade. On this terrace stand, among other noble buildings, the so-called houses of Birbal and of the \u2018Christian lady.\u2019 Birbal\u2019s palace, which modern antiquaries assign with greater probability to his daughter, is noticeable for its massive materials and the lavish minuteness of its detail. The \u2018Christian lady\u2019s house\u2019 belonged, according to tradition, to Bib\u00ed Mariam, a Portuguese wife of Akbar. Some of the paintings are supposed to represent Christian scenes, but the Musalm\u00e1ns have nearly obliterated all traces of these offensive pictures. Great doubts, however, have been cast upon the traditions respecting the \u2018Christian lady,\u2019 who was probably a Hindu princess, the mother of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. Among the other architectural masterpieces, the Diw\u00e1n-i-Kh\u00e1s and the Diw\u00e1n-i-\u00e1m, or Council Chamber and Hall of Judgment, especially attract the attention of visitors. The Elephant Gate contains two massive figures of the animals from which it derives its name; but their heads were removed by the Muhammadan bigotry of Aurangzeb. Close by towers the Hiran Min\u00e1r, a pile some 70 feet in height, covered with enamelled imitations of elephants\u2019 tusks, which are commonly believed by the populace to consist of solid ivory. Numerous other splendid buildings, dating back in every case to the reign of Akbar, or of his son Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, stand in various parts of the city. Fatehpur Sikri has little modern importance, and its architectural remains, which attract many tourists from Agra, are its chief claim to attention. During the Mutiny of 1857 it was occupied by the N\u00edmach (Neemuch) and Nas\u00edr\u00e1bd (Nusseerabad) rebels on the 2nd of July, and the British authorities did not permanently recover the place until November.\nThe modern town of Fatehpur lies to the south-west of the ruins and palaces, and the village of Sikri to the north-east, but both are within the old boundary wall built by Akbar, which had a circumference of about 7 miles. The public buildings comprise a police station, post-office, charitable dispensary, and Anglo-vernacular school. There is also a d\u00e1k bungalow, in a part of the old palace, formerly Akbar's record office; while other portions of the palace buildings are available for occupation by visitors on permission given by the Collector. Fatehpur Sikri is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari as among the principal places in the Mughal Empire in 1596, although it had then ceased for ten years to be the capital, and as celebrated for its hair-weaving, silk-spinning, and stone-carving, which 'clever workmen chisel so skilfully as no turner could do with wood.' Its grand sar\u00e1\u00ed was the rendezvous of merchants from all the then known parts of the globe, European countries being largely represented. But at the present day, the weaving of a few coarse and cheap cotton carpets, and the fashioning of rude millstones, are the only manufactures of the place, while its trade has dwindled down into the import of a few insignificant items, mainly for local consumption.\n\nFatw\u00e1 (Fatih\u00e1).\u2014Town in Patn\u00e1 District, Bengal, and station on the East Indian Railway, 8 miles from Patn\u00e1 city, and 324 from Calcutta. Situated in lat. 25\u00b0 30' 25\" N., and long. 85\u00b0 21' E., at the junction of the P\u00fanp\u00fan with the Ganges, and supported in a great measure by river traffic. Fatw\u00e1 was described by Dr. Buchanan Hamilton, in 1812, as a large country town, which might contain 2000 houses and 12,000 people, with a considerable trade and manufacture of cloth. Population (1881) 10,919, namely, Hindus, 9718; and Muhammadans, 1201. Area of town site, 588 acres. Its position on the railway and on the Ganges naturally give it commercial importance. Fatw\u00e1 is also a place of considerable sanctity. Five festivals are held here annually, when large numbers of pilgrims bathe in the sacred river. At the B\u00e1rn\u00ed Daw\u00e1das\u00ed, or festival commemorating an incarnation of Vishnu in the form of a dwarf, from 10,000 to 12,000 persons bathe at the junction of the P\u00fanp\u00fan with the Ganges.\n\nF\u00e1zilka.\u2014Tahsil of Sirsa District, Punj\u00e1b, lying along the bank of the river Sutlej (Satlaj). Area, 1196 square miles. Population (1881) 87,894, namely, males 48,345, and females 39,549. Muhammadans numbered 41,781; Hindus, 37,085; Sikhs, 8974; 'others,' 54. The tract is naturally divided into the low alluvial tract along the Sutlej, and the high land to the east, the latter being by far the larger of the two. Steps are being taken to re-open the P\u00e1di-n\u00e1la, an old inundation canal which once watered the lowlands; while a branch of the Sirhind Canal has been brought into the uplands, and was opened in 1882. Revenue of the tahsil, \u00a39552. The administrative staff consists of an\nextra-Assistant Commissioner and a tahsild\u00e1r, presiding over 2 civil and 2 criminal courts. Number of th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles, 3; strength of regular police, 81 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 187.\n\nF\u00e1zilka.\u2014Town and municipality in Sirsa District, Punjab, and head-quarters of F\u00e1zilka tahsil. Lat. 30\u00b0 24' 57\" N., long. 74\u00b0 4' 10\" E. Situated on the left bank of the Sutlej (Satlaj). Population (1881) 6851, namely, Hindus, 4917; Muhammadans, 1874; Sikhs, 44; and Jains, 16; number of houses, 1119. A third-class municipality. Municipal income in 1882-83, \u00a31969; expenditure, \u00a31484. Founded about 1846 by Mr. Oliver on the ruins of a deserted village, named after a Wattu chief, F\u00e1zil, and greatly developed by his exertions. Great entrep\u00f4t for the produce of the neighbourhood, and of the western portion of Pati\u00e1la, exported by boats down the Sutlej towards M\u00falt\u00e1n (Mooltan) and Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee). F\u00e1zilka is the most thriving and progressive town in this part of the Punjab. Considerable trade with Bh\u00e1walpur and B\u00edkaner, chiefly in grain and wool. The Indus Valley State Railway has established a d\u00e9p\u00f4t on the river bank, five miles from the town, to which steamers ply in the rainy season. It is proposed to connect F\u00e1zilka with the Firozpur-Rew\u00e1ri Railway, by a branch either at Bhatinda or Mukatsar.

In the following year, however, it was captured by the British, and hardly a vestige now remains of the town. The site lies a few miles from Beypur (Beypore), in Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency.\n\nFeroz\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Tahsil and town in Agra District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See FIROZABAD.\n\nFeroz\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Kheri District, Oudh.\u2014See FIROZABAD.\n\nFerozepur.\u2014District, tahsil, and town, Punjab.\u2014See FIROZPUR.\n\nFerozesh\u00e1h.\u2014Battle-field in Firozpur District, Punjab.\u2014See FIROZSHAH.\n\nFingeswar.\u2014Zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri or estate in the Central Provinces.\u2014See PHINGESWAR.\n\nFiringhi B\u00e1zar.\u2014Village in Dacca District, Bengal; situated in lat. 23\u00b0 33' N., and long. 90\u00b0 33' E., upon a branch of the river Ich\u00e1mat\u00ed. Noted as the first Portuguese settlement in the District, formed about 1663, during the Governorship of Sha\u00edst\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n. These Portuguese were mainly soldiers who had deserted from the service of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Arakan to that of Husain Beg, the Mughal general besieging Chittagong, which at that time was Arakanese territory. Firinghi B\u00e1zar was once of considerable size, but its prosperity has\ndeclined since the decay of the Dacca trade, and it is now an insignificant village.\n\n**Firingipet** *(Parangipet\u00e1i).*\u2014Town in South Arcot District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Porto Novo.\n\n**Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Tahsil of Agra District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the northern or Do\u00e1b bank of the river Jumna (Jamun\u00e1). Population (1881) 108,521, namely, males 59,287, and females 49,234. Hindus numbered 97,284; Muhammadans, 8826; Jains, 2407; \u2018others,\u2019 4. Number of villages, 285. Area, 203 square miles, of which 140 square miles are cultivated, 16 square miles cultivable, and 47 square miles barren. Land revenue, \u00a322,450; total Government revenue, including rates and cesses, \u00a325,144; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a342,307. With the exception of the extensive ravines which skirt the Jumna along the whole of its course in the tahsil, there are no remarkable physical features varying the general aspect of the country, which is that of a level cultivated plain. These ravines occupy an area of about 34 square miles, as a rule bare and unproductive, although large quantities of munj grass grow in some tracts, and in others there is a considerable growth of low jungle wood. Of the cultivated area, 84 per cent. is returned as irrigated; and of this, 96 per cent. derives its irrigation from wells, the average irrigated area per well being 6\u00b73 acres. Canal irrigation is confined to a very limited tract. The tahsil is traversed by the East Indian Railway, with a station at Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d town; by a branch of the Grand Trunk Road parallel to the railway; two second-class roads, and several third-class roads. It contains 2 criminal courts, with 4 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 56 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 331.\n\n**Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Town and municipality in Agra District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil. Lies in lat. 27\u00b0 8' 37\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 25' 56\" E., on the route from Muttra (Mathura) to Et\u00e1wah; distant from Agra 24 miles east. Population (1881) 16,023, namely, Hindus, 10,770; Muhammadans, 4473; Jains, 777; and \u2018others,\u2019 3; area of town site, 766 acres. Municipal income (1882\u201383), \u00a3789, of which \u00a3702 was derived from octroi; average incidence of taxation, 10\u00bdd. per head. Contains numerous ruins of handsome buildings, and appears to have been in former times an important centre. It is now a small trading town, with a considerable agricultural population. Station on the East Indian Railway main line, 817 miles from Calcutta. Telegraph office, charitable dispensary, Anglo-vernacular school, police station, post-office, encamping-ground, and rest-house.\n\n**Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Nigh\u00e1san tahsil, Kheri District, Oudh, lying between the Ch\u00e1uka, Kauri\u00e1la, and Dahaw\u00e1r rivers. The par-\ngan\u00e1 receives its name from the Emperor Firoz Sh\u00e1h, with whom it was a favourite hunting-ground. In olden times it belonged in great part to the Bisens; but they were expelled, after repeated conflicts, by the Jangres, who in their turn were ousted in 1776, and their R\u00e1j\u00e1 killed. About sixteen years afterwards, a relative of the deceased chief was granted a few patches of rent-free ground, which he gradually increased till in forty years he had obtained possession of the whole northern portion of the pargan\u00e1, which now forms the estate of Is\u00e1nagar, and is still in the possession of the family. The entire south of the pargan\u00e1 also forms a single estate, which has grown out of five villages granted to a Raikw\u00e1r Kshattriya chief, who extended his possessions at the expense of his neighbours. The pargan\u00e1 is of alluvial formation, but is now well raised, and but little of it is exposed to flood. Soil, principally loam, but towards the centre a good deal of clay. Area, 163 square miles, of which 104 are under cultivation. Population (1881), Hindus, 48,255; and Muhammadans, 6751: total, 55,006. The Lodh\u00eds, who form 16 per cent. of the population, are the most numerous caste; next come Ah\u00edrs (11 per cent.), and Br\u00e1hmans (10 per cent.). The 91 villages constituting the pargan\u00e1 are held entirely by the Jangre and Raikw\u00e1r t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs above mentioned, who divide the pargan\u00e1 in about equal proportions.\n\nFirozpur.\u2014British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between 30\u00b0 8' and 31\u00b0 11' N. lat., and between 74\u00b0 3' 30\" and 75\u00b0 27' E. long. Firozpur forms the southern District of the Lahore Division. It is bounded on the north-east by the river Sutlej (Satlaj), which separates it from Jalandhar (Jullundur); on the north-west by the united stream of the Sutlej and Beas (Bi\u00e1s), which divides it from Lahore; on the east and south-east by Ludhi\u00e1na District, and the Native States of Far\u00edd\u00f3kot, Pati\u00e1la, and N\u00e1bha, which last stretch into the District so as almost to divide it into two parts; and on the south-west by Sirsa District. Area, 2752 square miles; population (1881) 650,519. It stands seventeenth in order of area, and eleventh in order of population among the thirty-two Districts of the Punjab. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of FIROZPUR, on the southern bank of the Sutlej.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Firozpur is one unbroken plain, comprising within its limits every variety of soil, from the most fertile to the most barren, to be found in the eastern half of the Punjab. The action of the Sutlej has played a chief part in determining its geographical features. Striking the District at its north-eastern corner, the great river trends northwards to its junction with the Beas (Bi\u00e1s), after which the united channel turns sharply toward the south-west, until it passes beyond the borders of Firozpur. The angular segment thus circumscribed has for its base an ancient bed of the river, known\nas the Sukhar N\u00e1\u00ed, which winds in a tortuous course east and west across the District, and joins the modern channel near the confines of Sirsa. The abrupt cliff which rises above its right bank forms the most marked element in the physical aspect of the country. Within the memory of the present generation, water is said to have flowed in its bed, while groves of shisham trees lined the banks; but no traces of timber now remain. Evidence, however, still exists of yet another and more ancient change of course in the shifting waters of the Sutlej. The original bank, locally known as the d\u00e1nda, crosses the south-western corner of the District 35 miles east of the present stream. It can be traced distinctly as far as the battle-field of M\u00fadk\u00ed (Moodkee), and thence at intervals to the Sutlej, 15 miles farther to the north. The poorest portion of Firozpur lies to the west of the d\u00e1nda, beyond the fertilizing influence of the modern river. The soil consists of hard and hopelessly sterile sand, while the water obtained from wells is largely impregnated with salt, and lies at a depth of 180 feet below the surface. East of the d\u00e1nda, however, excellent agricultural land stretches over the upland tract or rohi; and the wells yield sweet and drinkable water, sufficiently close to the surface for purposes of irrigation. The bh\u00e9t or low-lying tract between the great river and the high bank of the Sukhar N\u00e1\u00ed, has a maximum width of 14 miles opposite the confluence of the Beas (Bi\u00e1s) and the Sutlej. Much of its soil consists of a poor and sandy loam, but great facilities exist for artificial water-supply; while the annual inundations render the border fringe extremely productive, through the deposit of a rich black silt.\n\nThe northern portion of the District comprises a fairly-wooded region, though most of the trees have been planted in recent years; but the southern half is still extremely bare of shade. When Firozpur first came under British rule, our authorities almost despaired of arboriculture in so dry a tract; yet the constant efforts of the settlement officers, who set apart a piece of ground as a plantation in every village, have at length been crowned with success, and the neighbourhood of the river, at least, now presents a pleasing variety of siris, far\u00e1sh, and pipal trees. Plantations have also been established round every police station throughout the District, forming agreeable breaks in the monotony of the levels and cultivated plain. The only animals of prey found in considerable numbers in Firozpur are wolves, which, although not of large size, are fierce and mischievous. Jackals and foxes are few in number. Antelope still exist in tolerable abundance, but they are much shot down. Small game includes hares, black and grey partridges, and sand-grouse in abundance; and in the cold weather, kulang (demoiselle crane), wild geese and duck on and near the river. Quail and small birds are trapped by means of decoys and nets. Rohu and chilka fish are caught\nin the Sutlej, but there are no fisheries of importance in the District.\n\nHistory.\u2014Tradition, supported by remains of antiquity, assigns a former period of great prosperity to a region which now forms the dreariest waste in the District of Firozpur. The neighbourhood of the dry d\u00e1nda channel, at present almost uninhabited, bears witness, by its deserted sites and choked-up wells, to the existence of a numerous agricultural population along its now desolate banks. Though no date can be absolutely determined for this epoch of prosperity, there are good grounds for the belief that the Sutlej still flowed east of Firozpur in the time of Akbar; for the famous Mughal Domesday-Book, known as the Ain-i-Akbari, describes the town as the capital of a large district attached to the western Province of M\u00falt\u00e1n (Mooltan), and not to that of Sirhind, as would probably have been the case had the river already taken its modern course. The shifting of the river, from which the tract derived its fertility, and the ravages of war, were doubtless the chief causes of its decline, which probably commenced before the end of the 16th century. The country certainly presented the appearance of a desert when, about two centuries ago, the Dogras, a tribe who claim to rank as Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jputs, settled near P\u00e1kpatan, and gradually spread up the Sutlej valley. They found none to oppose them, as the scattered Bhatti population who occupied the soil retired before the new colonists. At length, in 1740, according to tradition, they reached Firozpur, which became thenceforth the capital of the tribe. The imperial authority was represented by an officer stationed at Kas\u00far, to the west of the Sutlej, bearing the title of the \u2018Faujd\u00e1r of the Lakka Jungle.\u2019 About the same time, a tide of J\u00e1t immigration appears to have set in from the direction of Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 (Umballa) and Sirhind; and Sikh chieftains began to carve out petty principalities for themselves in the western portion of the District. In 1763, the Bhangi confederacy, one of the great Sikh sections, attacked and conquered Firozpur under their famous leader, Gujar Singh, who made over the newly-acquired territory to his nephew, Gurbakhsh Singh. The young Sikh chieftain rebuilt the fort and consolidated his power on the Sutlej, but spent most of his time in other portions of the Province. In 1792 he seems to have divided his estates with his family, when Firozpur fell to Dhanna Singh, his second son. The little State, encircled by enemies, proved almost too difficult a realm for its new ruler, who lost his territories piece by piece, but still retained possession of Firozpur itself, when Ranjit Singh crossed the Sutlej in 1808, and threatened to absorb all the minor principalities which lay between his domain and the British frontier. But the English Government, established at Delhi since 1803, intervened with an offer of protection to all the cis-Sutlej States; and Dhanna Singh gladly availed himself of the promised aid,\nbeing one of the first chieftains who accepted British protection and control. Ranjit Singh at once ceased to interfere with the minor States when the assistance of the British arms lay ready to support their rights; and Dhanna Singh retained the remnant of his dominions unmolested, until his death in 1818. He left no sons, and his widow succeeded to his principality during her lifetime; but on her death in 1835, the territory escheated to the British Government, under the conditions of the arrangement effected in 1809. The political importance of Firozpur had been already recognised, and an officer was at once deputed to take possession of the new post. After the boundary had been carefully determined, the District was made over for a while to a native official; but it soon became desirable to make Firozpur the permanent seat of a European Political Officer. In 1839, Sir Henry (then Captain) Lawrence took charge of the station, which formed at that time the advanced outpost of British India in the direction of the Sikh power. Early accounts represent the country as a dreary and desert plain, where rain seldom fell, and dust-storms never ceased. The energy of Captain Lawrence, however, combined with the unwonted security under British rule, soon attracted new settlers to this hitherto desolate region. Cultivation rapidly increased, trees began to fringe the water-side, trade collected round the local centres, and Firozpur, which in 1835 was a deserted village, had in 1841 a population of nearly 5000 persons. Four years later, the first Sikh war broke out. The enemy crossed the Sutlej opposite Firozpur on the 16th December 1845; and the battles of M\u00fadk\u00ed (Moodkee), Firozsh\u00e1h, Al\u00edw\u00e1l, and Sobr\u00e1on\u2014all of them within the limits of the present District\u2014followed one another in rapid succession. Broken by their defeats, the Sikhs once more retired across the boundary river, pursued by the British army, which dictated the terms of peace beneath the walls of Lahore. The whole cis-Sutlej possessions of the Punjab kingdom passed into the hands of the East India Company, and the little principality of Firozpur became at once the nucleus for an important British District. The existing area was increased by subsequent additions, the last of which took place in 1864. Since the successful close of the first Sikh campaign, the peace of the District has never been broken, except during the Mutiny of 1857. In May of that year, one of the two Native infantry regiments stationed at Firozpur broke out into revolt, and, in spite of a British regiment and some European artillery, plundered and destroyed the buildings of the cantonment. The arsenal and magazine, however, which gave the station its principal importance, were saved without loss of life to the European garrison. The mutineers were subsequently dispersed.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The earliest Census of Firozpur District was taken in 1854, and showed a total population of 475,624 persons. The\narea then differed but little from that of the present time. A second enumeration, undertaken in January 1868, disclosed a total of 549,614 persons, over the area comprising the present District. In 1881, the Census returned the population at 650,519, showing a further increase of 100,905, or 18.4 per cent., in the thirteen years since 1868. The results arrived at by the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area of the District, 2752 square miles; number of towns and villages, 1189; number of houses, 89,416, of which 74,429 are occupied and 14,987 unoccupied. Total population, 650,519, namely, males 357,319, and females 293,200; proportion of males in total population, 54.9 per cent. As regards religious distinctions, the District is mainly noticeable for the comparatively large proportion of its Sikh inhabitants, who number 168,816, or 25.9 per cent. of the total. The Muhammadans were returned at 310,552, or 47.7 per cent.; the Hindus at 168,645, or 25.9 per cent. Jains numbered 811; Christians, 1686; and Parsis, 9. The agricultural population amounted to 368,358 persons, of whom 109,533 were male agriculturists above the age of 15 years. As regards ethnical divisions and caste distinctions, the Hindus and Sikhs comprised 12,076 Brahmins, 3595 Rajputs, 9174 Kshattriyas, 11,335 Baniyas, 13,306 Aroras, and 159,941 Jats; while the Musalm\u00e1n element included 35,943 Rajputs, 26,635 Jats, 11,975 Gujars, 6806 Shaikhs, 3134 Sayyids, 1103 Mughals, 3122 Pathans, and 2486 Khwajas. The Muhammadans chiefly inhabit the low-lying lands (bhat) along the banks of the Sutlej. The Dogras and Bhatts form the leading Rajput tribes, and bear the reputation of being lazy and thriftless. They also contribute to swell the returns of crime far beyond their fair numerical proportion. On the other hand, they hold a high social position in the District. The Sikh and Hindu Jats, fine specimens of their hardy and industrious race, apply their energy to cultivation in the upland plateau of the rohi. The Rajas of the neighbouring States of Patiala, Jhind, and Nabha, belong to the Barar sub-division of the Jat tribe. The population lies scattered very unevenly over the various portions of the District. In some parts of the low-lying Sutlej belt, a message can be passed from village to village, according to popular belief, by the human voice; while in the extreme south, a horseman at full speed could not pass from one inhabited spot to another within an hour. The District contains 5 municipalities\u2014namely, Firozpur, population (1881) 20,870, exclusive of cantonment; Muktsar, 3125; Dharmkot, 6007; Zira, 3492; Makhu, 1658. The only other towns in the District are Moga, population 6430; and Mahraj, 5758. Firozpur, the head-quarters station, is also important as a great military cantonment, and the chief arsenal of the Punjab. Population of cantonment (1881) 18,700. Of the 1189 towns and villages within the District, 370 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 457 had\nfrom two to five hundred; 213 from five hundred to a thousand; 103 from one to two thousand; 30 from two to three thousand; 12 from three to five thousand; 3 from five to ten thousand; and 1 upwards of ten thousand. Classified according to occupation, the Census Report divides the adult male population into the following seven groups:\n\nClass (1) Professional, 9669; (2) domestic, 18,404; (3) commercial, 2714; (4) agricultural and pastoral, 111,380; (5) manufacturing and industrial, 38,906; (6) indefinite and non-productive, 15,609; (7) unspecified, 21,237.\n\nCondition of the People.\u2014The general prosperity of the District is great; the price of land is rising, and the income of the population, both agricultural and commercial, is reported to be steadily increasing. Owing to the prevalence of the coparcenary system, it is difficult to fix the ordinary income of an agriculturist. One, however, whose share amounts to 9 acres of ordinary land is certainly in comfortable circumstances, and able to live quite as well as a small shopkeeper in a town. His average expenses in ordinary times may be put down at from 5s. to 6s. a month. But on occasions of religious or social ceremonies, such as betrothals, marriages, funerals, and other gatherings, the peasantry are obliged by custom to incur extravagant expenses, which plunge them into debt, and sometimes result in utter ruin. Every peasant has his account with the village money-lender, but only a small proportion of the agricultural population are hopelessly involved. The usual rate of interest for cash loans is about 24 per cent., but 37\u00bd per cent. is a common rate, and occasionally as much as 75 per cent. is taken. In loans of grain, the interest charged is higher than in money transactions; and the money-lender almost always makes a large extra profit by crediting payments in kind at a much lower rate than that at which he calculates the loan. Where ornaments are pledged, 12 per cent. is the current rate of interest; and in mortgages of land, one-fourth of the produce is usually taken in lieu of interest.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014According to the returns quoted in the Administration Report for 1882-83, the District contained in 1878-79 a total cultivated area of 1,343,922 acres; of which 231,162 were irrigated from private works, leaving 1,112,760 acres unsupplied with water by artificial means. The remainder comprised 276,356 acres of cultivable waste, and 135,910 of barren land. It appears, therefore, that only 7\u00b77 per cent. of the whole District consists of irreclaimably sterile soil, while 76\u00b75 per cent. has already been brought under the plough. The staple crops include wheat for the rabi or spring harvest; and the two common millets, jo\u00e1r and bajra, for the kharif or autumn harvest. Other important items are\u2014barley, gram, tobacco, and oil-seeds for the rabi; and maize, cotton, pulses, and til for the kharif.\nThe low-lying lands along the Sutlej also produce a small quantity of rice. The area under the various staples (including land bearing two crops) was returned as follows in 1882\u201383:\u2014Wheat, 401,565 acres; jo\u00e1r, 219,717 acres; b\u00e1jra, 62,830 acres; maize, 71,850 acres; barley, 139,397 acres; gram, 236,624 acres; other pulses, 142,357 acres; rice, 3109 acres; tobacco, 1789 acres; cotton, 12,877 acres; hemp, 3879 acres; oil-seeds, 52,801 acres; vegetables, 5285 acres; sugar-cane, 2553 acres. Irrigation is supplied from wells and canals. A single well in the bh\u00e9t tract will water from 20 to 40 acres; in the rohi, from 12 to 20 acres. All of them are of very recent construction, and owe their origin to the native industry of the people, aided by the advice and encouragement of an energetic British official. In 1875\u201376, as many as 43,331 acres of land received irrigation in this manner for the first time. The whole southern portion of the District still lies exposed to the ravages of famine, water being found at too great a depth to permit the use of wells for agricultural purposes; but to this thirsty tract the Sirhind Canal, now (1883) completed, affords an abundant means of irrigation. The only manures used are village sweepings and ashes, and these are confined to the irrigated lands of the bh\u00e9t. The agricultural stock in the District is approximately returned as under:\u2014294,254 cows and bullocks, 2469 horses, 2246 ponies, 9076 donkeys, 79,101 sheep and goats, 57 pigs, 3741 camels, 10,014 carts, 75,141 ploughs, 201 boats. The tenures of land conform to the ordinary Punjab types\u2014zamind\u00e1ri being commonest among the R\u00e1jp\u00fats of the lowlands, while a partition of shares has usually taken place in the J\u00e1t communities of the interior. Tenant cultivators ordinarily pay their rents in kind, at rates which range from one-fourth to one-half of the gross produce. Money rates are paid only by occupancy tenants, who were permitted at the settlement of the land-tax to commute payment in kind for a cash percentage upon the revenue due from their holdings. Occasional agricultural labour is always paid in grain. Of a total area of 2744 square miles, 1995 square miles are assessed, at a Government revenue, including local rates and cesses on land, of \u00a358,175. Rental paid by cultivators, \u00a3132,974. Cash wages in 1882\u201383 ranged from 3d. to 4\u00bdd. per diem for unskilled labour, and from 6d. to 1s. 6d. for skilled labour. The prices-current of food-grains ruled as follows on the 1st January 1883:\u2014Wheat, 23 sers per rupee, or 4s. 10d. per cwt.; barley, 46 sers per rupee, or 2s. 5d. per cwt.; Indian corn, 44 sers per rupee, or 2s. 6d. per cwt.; gram, 42 sers per rupee, or 2s. 8d. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 48 sers per rupee, or 2s. 4d. per cwt.; and b\u00e1jra, 29 sers per rupee, or 3s. 10d. per cwt. These prices are exceptionally low, and are due to two successive abundant harvests, which were common to the Punjab as well as to the whole of Northern India.\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Although the southern half of the District depends entirely upon the rainfall for its harvests, yet Firozpur has suffered comparatively little from famine. In 1869-70, the District not only supplied its own internal needs, but continued to export grain throughout the season of scarcity. Relief was required during several months, but principally for immigrants from Bikaner (Bickaneer). On January 1st, 1870, wheat sold for 8 sers per rupee, or 14s. per cwt.; and barley, for 11 sers per rupee, or 10s. 2d. per cwt.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The staple export of the District consists of grain, for which the market of Firozpur forms the local centre. The enterprising J\u00e1t cultivators of the interior carry on trade upon their own account, conveying their produce on camels or in carts, not only to Firozpur itself, but also to Amritsar, and even to Lahore. In the Sutlej (Satlaj) belt, the village Baniy\u00e1 acts as merchant and banker. Firozpur does a considerable trade with all the towns between the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1) and the Beas (Bi\u00e1s), while large consignments of wheat and cotton, collected from the District and the neighbouring Native States, are shipped down the Sutlej for Sukkur and Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed (Kurrachee). The exports to towns beyond the Punjab alone reached a value of \u00a354,056 in 1871-72, but there are no statistics available for the general trade of the District. An important cattle fair takes place annually in the month of January at Mukts\u00e1r, on the occasion of a great Sikh festival. The local manufactures are of the humblest description, being entirely confined to the supply of the neighbouring country. Coarse cloths and blankets are woven in the villages from home-grown cotton and wool. The chief road is that which connects Firozpur town with Lahore on the one side, and with the Punjab Railway at Ludhi\u00e1na on the other; it is metalled throughout, and passable by wheeled vehicles at all seasons. Good lines also radiate from Firozpur to Jalandhar (Jullundur), Karn\u00e1l, Pati\u00e1la, F\u00e1zilka, and other neighbouring towns. The total length of communications in 1882-83 was returned as follows:\u2014By water, 128 miles; by metalled road, 80 miles; by unmetalled road, 710 miles. A line of railway is now (1884) under construction, leaving the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na State Railway at Rew\u00e1ri, in Gurg\u00e1o District, and running, via Hiss\u00e1r and Sirsa Districts, to Firozpur. A line of telegraph connects the cantonment and arsenal of Firozpur with Ludhi\u00e1na, and so with the other military centres of the Punjab.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The ordinary head-quarters staff of the District consists of a Deputy Commissioner, a Judicial Assistant, and two extra-Assistant Commissioners, besides a District Superintendent and Assistant Superintendent of Police. For fiscal purposes the District is divided into the four Sub-divisions or tahsils of Firozpur, Mog\u00e1, Mukts\u00e1r, and Zir\u00e1, each being in charge of a tahsild\u00e1r, assisted by a n\u00e1ib or deputy.\nMunsifs' courts are established at Firozpur, Mog\u00e1, and Zir\u00e1. In 1851\u201352, the total revenue derived from the District amounted to \u00a344,587; in 1861\u201362, it had risen to \u00a350,712; in 1875\u201376, to \u00a362,386; and in 1882\u201383, to \u00a375,816. This steady increase is mainly due to the growth of the land revenue, under the influence of extended irrigation and the impetus given to agricultural industry by a settled and peaceable Government; but part of it must also be attributed to the larger income derived from stamps. In 1851\u201352, the land-tax amounted to \u00a336,044; by 1875\u201376, it had reached \u00a350,953; and in 1882\u201383, to \u00a351,489, or about two-thirds of the total revenue. The land settlement in force was effected between the years 1852\u201355, and expired in 1883. Besides the imperial revenue, a local income of about \u00a39500 is realized by means of cesses for expenditure upon works of public utility within the District. In 1882, the regular police force numbered 556 men, including the municipal constabulary and cantonment police; being an average of 1 man to every 4.95 square miles and every 1169 of the population. This force is further supplemented by a rural body of 790 village watchmen or chaukid\u00e1rs. The District jail and lock-up at Firozpur contained a total of 1323 prisoners in 1882\u201383, the average daily prison population being 320. Education has made but little way against the universal apathy of the inhabitants. In 1872\u201373, Government supported or aided 45 schools within the District, with 2569 pupils. In 1875\u201376, the number of inspected schools had risen to 53, and of pupils to 2755; while in 1881, although the number of Government and aided schools had risen to 61, the pupils had fallen to 2631. These figures show an average of 1 school to 45 square miles, and of 4.0 scholars for every thousand of the population. There are also a number of indigenous unaided schools in the District of a very elementary class, variously returned at 197 with 2126 pupils, and 287 with 2903 pupils. The Census Report of 1881 returned 3342 boys and 181 girls as being under instruction, besides 15,138 males and 318 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. The five municipal towns had in 1882\u201383 an aggregate income of \u00a35092, being at the rate of 2s. 1d. per head of their population.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The District enjoys a reputation for exceptional healthiness, owing principally to the dryness of its climate; but in September and October, fever and pleuro-pneumonia largely prevail. Small-pox also exists in an endemic form, but its ravages have been greatly reduced since the more general spread of vaccination. Guinea-worm is not uncommon in the south of the District, and is traceable to the water. The official returns for 1882 give the total number of deaths during the year at 14,225, being at the rate of 22 per thousand of the population. The District contains one civil hospital, at Firozpur,\nwhich gave relief in 1882 to 10,462 persons, of whom 579 were in-patients. There is also a second-class dispensary at Zira, and a third-class one at Mukts\u00e1r, besides another at Mamdot, maintained by the Naw\u00e1b. The rainfall is capricious, and scanty even in the best years; but its quantity appears to have increased, while its regularity has greatly improved with the spread of cultivation and the growth of trees. The average annual rainfall at Firozpur for the thirty years ending 1881 was 22.72 inches; but that of the southern tract falls far short of the quantity in the northern lowlands. In 1881 the rainfall was 20.90 inches, or 1.82 inch below the average. No systematic thermometrical record has ever been maintained in the District. Private observations, however, show that in December and January the in-door temperature ranges between 40\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 F., whilst during June and July (with closed doors) its range in houses not artificially cooled is from 92\u00b0 to 97\u00b0.

Area, 495 square miles. Population (1881) 153,168, namely, males 86,366, and females 66,802; persons per square mile, 309. Hindus numbered 34,334; Muhammadans, 101,963; Sikhs, 15,034; and 'others,' 1837. The revenue of the tahsil in 1883 was \u00a38970. The administrative staff consists of 1 Deputy Commissioner, 1 Judicial Assistant, 2 extra-Assistant Commissioners, 1 small cause court judge, 1 tahsild\u00e1r, 1 munsif, and 4 honorary magistrates. These officers preside over 10 civil and 10 criminal courts, with 5 police stations; strength of regular police, 112 men, with 184 village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs).\n\nFirozpur.\u2014Town, military cantonment, and administrative headquarters of Firozpur District, Punjab. Situated in lat. 30\u00b0 56' 42\" N., and long. 74\u00b0 38' 24\" E., on the old high bank of the Sutlej (Satlaj), 3\u00bd miles from the present bed of the river. The town was founded, according to tradition, in the time of Firoz Sh\u00e1h, Emperor of Delhi, A.D. 1351-1387, but was in a declining state at the period of British annexation. Under a settled government, however, its growth has been rapid and steady, the population having increased five-fold since 1841. It is now the seat of a thriving commerce, due principally to the exertions of Sir H. Lawrence, who induced many native traders to settle in the city, and more lately to the enterprise of an English merchant, who has erected a powerful cotton-press in the vicinity. The main streets are wide and well paved, while a circular road which\ngirdles the wall is lined by the gardens of wealthy residents. The total population of Firozpur in 1881 (including the cantonment) was 39,570, namely, males 23,971, and females 15,599. Muhammadans numbered 17,609; Hindus, 19,004; Sikhs, 1207; Jains, 72; Christians and 'others,' 1678. The public buildings include the District court-house, treasury, post-office, police station, and staging bungalow, within the cantonments; the jail, town-hall, dispensary, school-house, and sar\u00e1\u00ed, upon the road connecting the city with the military station; and the memorial church, in honour of those who fell in the Sutlej campaign of 1845-46, destroyed during the Mutiny, but since restored. Thriving trade in grain and other agricultural produce. For early history and events of 1857, see FIROZPUR DISTRICT. Municipal revenue in 1882-83, \u00a34174, or 4s. per head of population (20,870) within municipal limits. The cantonments lie 2 miles south of the city; and the garrison, now much reduced, ordinarily consists of a regiment of British infantry, one of Native infantry, and two batteries of artillery. The cantonment population in 1881 numbered 18,700. The arsenal, to which the town owes its political importance, is by far the largest in the Punjab, and well stored with munitions of war.\n\n**Firozpur.**\u2014Southern tahsil of Gurg\u00e1on District, Punjab; lying between 27\u00b0 39' and 27\u00b0 59' N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 56' and 77\u00b0 9' E. long. Area, 317 square miles. Population (1881) 114,340, namely, males 59,272, and females 55,068; average density, 361 persons per square mile. Muhammadans numbered 80,835; Hindus, 32,479; Sikhs, 12; and 'others,' 1014. The revenue of the tahsil in 1883 was \u00a323,296. The administrative staff consists of a tahsild\u00e1r, who presides over the only civil and criminal court. Two police stations; strength of regular police, 58 men; village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 264.\n\n**Firozpur.**\u2014Town and municipality in Gurg\u00e1on District, Punjab, and head-quarters of Firozpur tahsil. Situated in lat. 27\u00b0 46' 30\" N., and long. 76\u00b0 59' 30\" E., in a fertile valley on a small perennial stream, the Landoh, in the extreme south of the District. Said to have been founded by the Emperor Firoz Sh\u00e1h, who placed a cantonment here for the subjugation of the neighbouring hill tribes. Annexed by the British Government in 1803, but granted in j\u00e1gir to Ahmad Baksh Kh\u00e1n, whose son, Naw\u00e1b Shams-ud-d\u00edn Kh\u00e1n, was executed in 1836 for the murder of Mr. W. Fraser, Commissioner of Delhi. Since that period it has formed the head-quarters of a tahsil. Population (1881) 6878, namely, Hindus, 3216; Muhammadans, 3111; Jains, 549; and Sikhs, 11. Number of occupied houses, 957. Thriving trade in country produce; exports of grain and cotton; imports of rice, sugar, and English piece-goods. Tahsili, police station, school-house. The oldest part of the present town is rectangular in shape, and surrounded\nby a high wall; but one half of the houses now lie outside the wall towards the east. The main bazaars, running at right angles to one another, are unusually good for a small town,\u2014broad, well drained, neatly paved, and ornamented with trees. Municipal revenue in 1882-83, \u00a3622, or 1s. 6d. per head of population (8235) within municipal limits.\n\n**Firozsh\u00e1h.**\u2014Battle-field in Firozpur tahsil, Firozpur District, Punjab; situated in lat. 30\u00b0 53' N., and long. 74\u00b0 49' 45\" E., about 12 miles from the left bank of the Sutlej (Satlaj). Rendered famous by the attack made upon the formidably-entrenched Sikh camp, Dec. 21, 1845, by the British forces under Sir Hugh Gough and Sir Henry Hardinge. After two days\u2019 severe fighting, the entrenchments were carried and the enemy completely routed, but not without heavy losses on the part of the conquerors. No trace of the earthworks now remains, but a monument erected upon the spot perpetuates the memory of the officers and men who fell in the engagement. The real name of the place, as called by the people, is Phar\u00fa Shahr, corrupted into the historical name Firozsh\u00e1h.\n\n**Fort St. David.**\u2014South Arcot District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See David, Fort St.\n\n**Fort St. George.**\u2014Citadel of Madras, and the name officially applied to the Government of the Presidency.\u2014See Madras Town.\n\n**Fort Victoria** (or Bankot, under which name a brief notice has also been given).\u2014Village and old fort at the mouth of the Savitri river, 73 miles south-east from Bombay, and 10 miles north by west of Suvarndrug. Lat. 17\u00b0 58' 30\" N., long. 73\u00b0 5' 10\" E. In the beginning of the last century, \u2018Bancoote\u2019 or Fort Victoria was a pirate nest of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chief, Angria. It was captured along with Suvarndrug (Severndrug) in 1755, by an English squadron under Commander James, during the operations against the Angrian buccaneers. Bankot lies at the foot of a rocky headland in the extreme north of Ratn\u00e1giri District. A mile outside the village and two miles southwest of Fort Victoria, there is a bar on the Bankot river, with a narrow channel on its south-east side, with 9 feet at low water. Although well-buoyed, the bar is much exposed even in the fine season (September\u2014June), and should not be passed without a pilot. Bankot is closed during the south-west monsoon, but opens earlier and remains open longer than most of the Ratn\u00e1giri ports. The river is navigable, for vessels of 16 feet draught, 18 miles to Mah\u00e1pral in D\u00e1poli, and for vessels drawing 7 feet 10 miles farther to Mah\u00e1d in Kol\u00e1ba. Trade has long left Bankot. It is now little more than a large fishing village, with no manufactures. Coasting steamers call daily during the fair season. Landing-stage, bridge of boats, and a roomy rest-house for travellers.\nFort-William.\u2014Citadel of Calcutta, and the name officially applied to the Government of Bengal.\u2014See Calcutta.\n\nFoul Island (in Burmese, Nan-tha-kywun).\u2014An uninhabited island off the coast of Sandoway, in the Arakan Division, British Burma; lying about lat. 18\u00b0 3' N., 6 leagues from the mainland, and 7 from Bluff Point, and visible from a distance of 8 leagues. The island is about 2 miles long, and is conical in form. To the north-east there are islets and rocks near the shore, and a reef partly above water extending southwards. The name is derived from a mud-volcano, which at times emits a torrent of hot mud bubbling with marsh gas.\n\nFraserpet.\u2014Town in the Commissionership of Coorg; situated in latitude 12\u00b0 27' 30\" N., and longitude 76\u00b0 0' 20\" E., on the banks of the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) river, 20 miles east of Merk\u00e1ra, the capital of Coorg, and 2720 feet above sea-level. Population (1881) 1310, namely, males 631, females 679; number of houses, 298. Originally called Khush\u00e1l\u00edngar, 'glad town,' by Haidar Al\u00ed (who was then invading Coorg), on the news of the birth of his son Tip\u00fa first reaching him there, and he so named it in honour of the event; it derives its present name from Colonel Fraser, who was appointed the first British Political Agent in Coorg (1834), after its conquest by the British. The fort was built of hewn stone by Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, and stormed and demolished in 1789 by the Coorgs under their native R\u00e1j\u00e1, Dodda Vira R\u00e1jendra. The ruins supplied materials for the construction of the fine bridge over the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery), finished in 1848. Fraserpet is a pleasant retreat during the rainy season, the climate being much milder, and the rains less severe than at Merk\u00e1ra. It used to be the monsoon residence of the Commissioner of Coorg, but has lately been less frequented.\n\nFrench Possessions.\u2014The following brief account of the French Settlements in India has been condensed from materials courteously furnished by His Excellency the Governor-General of French India, supplemented by later documents at the Minist\u00e8re de la Marine et des Colonies, Paris, June 1879, and from Pondicherri, dated May 1884. Pains have been taken to render the account accurate; but no responsibility can be accepted for any statements contained in it. A separate account of each of the Settlements is given under its own name. It has not, however, always been found possible to bring the local figures into exact accord with those obtained in France for this general r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nThe head-quarters of the Governor-General of French India are at Pondicherry (q.v.); and the French Possessions comprise the following five Settlements, with certain dependent 'Lodges.' They aggregate 203 square miles, and had a total population in 1882 of 273,611.\nFRENCH POSSESSIONS IN INDIA.\n\n| Name            | Area in Square Miles | Population (1882) | Revenue for 1883 |\n|-----------------|----------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Pondicherri     | 115                  | 140,943          | \u00a357,316         |\n| Chandarnagar    | 4                    | 26,443           | 8,400           |\n| Karikal         | 53                   | 93,443           | 17,743          |\n| Mah\u00e9            | 26                   | 8,246            | 1,790           |\n| Yanan, or Yanan | 5                    | 4,536            | 1,539           |\n| Total           | 203                  | 273,611          | \u00a386,788         |\n\nA more detailed but less recent statement, dated Pondicherri, 1st January 1877, gives the total population at 280,381, namely, Europeans, 1116; Eurasians, 1511; natives, 277,754.\n\nHistory.\u2014The first French expedition into Indian waters, with a view to opening up commercial relations, dates as far back as 1603. It was undertaken by private merchants of Rouen; but it failed, as also did several similar attempts which followed it. In 1642, Cardinal Richelieu founded the first Compagnie des Indes Orientales, but its efforts met with no success. Colbert reconstituted the Company on a larger basis in 1664, granting it exemption from taxes and a monopoly of the Indian trade for fifty years. After having twice attempted, without success, to establish itself in Madagascar, Colbert's Company again took up the idea of direct trade with India, and its President, Caron, founded in 1668 the 'Comptoir' or agency at Surat. But on finding that city unsuited for a head establishment, he seized the harbour of Trincomali in Ceylon from the Dutch. The Dutch, however, speedily retook Trincomali; and Caron, passing over to the Coromandel coast, in 1672, seized Saint Thom\u00e9, a Portuguese town which had for twelve years been in the possession of Holland. He had, however, to restore it to the Dutch in 1674.\n\nThe ruin of the Company seemed impending, when one of its agents, the celebrated Fran\u00e7ois Martin, suddenly restored it. Rallying under him a handful of sixty Frenchmen, saved out of the wrecks of the colonies at Trincomali and Saint Thomas, he took up his abode at Pondicherri, then a small village, which he purchased in 1683 from the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Vijayapur. He built fortifications, and a trade began to spring up; but he was unable to hold the town against the Dutch, who accordingly wrested it from him in 1693, and held it until it was restored to the French by the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697.\n\nPondicherri became in this year, and has ever since remained, the most important of the French Settlements in India. Its foundation\nwas exactly contemporaneous with that of Calcutta; like Calcutta, its site was purchased by a European Company from a Native Prince; and what Job Charnock was to Calcutta, Fran\u00e7ois Martin proved to Pondicherri. On its restitution to the French by the Peace of Ryswick in 1699, Martin was appointed Governor-General, and under his able management Pondicherri became an entrep\u00f4t of trade. Chandarnagar, in Lower Bengal, had been acquired by the French Company in 1688, by grant from the Delhi Emperor; Mahe, on the Malabar coast, was obtained in 1725\u201326, under the government of M. Lenoir; Karikal, on the Coromandel coast, under that of M. Dumas in 1739. Yanaon and Masulipatam (the site of a French factory in the 17th century), on the northern coast of Madras, were taken possession of in 1750, and were formally ceded to the French two years later.\n\nThe war of 1741 between France and England, led to the attack alike of Madras and of Pondicherri, the capitals of the French and English Companies in Southern India. Labourdonnais equipped at his own expense a fleet, and laid siege to Madras, which capitulated on the 21st September 1746. It was ransomed for \u00a3400,000. The English in due time made reprisals. On the 26th April 1748 they appeared before Pondicherri, but eventually retired after a most skilful defence of the town conducted by Dupleix during forty-two days. The peace of Aix-la-Chapelle put a stop, in that year, to further hostilities, and left Dupleix free to realize his dream of an Indian Empire for France. Between 1746 and 1756 he obtained from the Delhi Emperor the Naw\u00e1bship of the Karn\u00e1tic; established a protectorate over the Subahat of Arcot and other parts of Southern India; made large additions to the French territory around Pondicherri, Karikal, and Masulipatam, and extended the French authority over the four Districts of Montfanagar, Eloffre, R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri (R\u00e1jahmundry), with Chikakol and the island of Seringham, formed by two arms of the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery). These various annexations opened up to the French commerce 200 leagues of seaboard, and yielded a revenue of \u00a3800,000 ('20 millions de francs').\n\nThis period of power proved of short duration. Dupleix, feebly supported by the Court of Versailles, met with a series of reverses from the English Company, and was recalled to Paris in 1753. A certain extent of territory still remained to his successor; but during the Seven Years' War, the Government of France could afford no reinforcements for its Indian possessions. The English Company overran them, defeated the French at Wandewash, and seized Arcot. Lally-Tollendal, after a chivalrous defence, surrendered Pondicherri on the 6th January 1761. The English demolished the town; the walls, the forts, the public buildings, were all destroyed. The captured troops\nand all Europeans in the French Company's service were deported back to France.\n\nTwo years later, the peace of 1763 restored Pondicherri and the other Indian factories to the French; but with their former territories greatly curtailed. The abolition of the monopoly of the French Company in 1769 threw open the trade, and Pondicherri began to show signs of a new vitality. But in 1778 it again fell into the hands of the English East India Company. In 1782 the Bailli de Suffren made a brilliant effort on behalf of his depressed countrymen, fighting four battles with the English in seven months, and retaking the fort of Trincomali. Next year, the Treaty of Versailles restored Pondicherri and the other factories to the French, 20th January 1783. But the English Company took advantage, as usual, of the breaking out of the next war in Europe to seize the French possessions in India, and again compelled their rivals to evacuate their settlements in 1793. The Peace of Amiens once more restored them to the French in 1802; on the renewal of hostilities, the English Company again seized them, 11th September 1803. Pondicherri thus passed for the fourth time under British rule; and, during the long Napoleonic wars, the French power ceased to exist in India.\n\nPondicherri and the other factories were restored to the French by the treaties of 1814 and 1815, the territories being finally reduced to their present narrow limits. The French had to begin the whole work of their Indian settlements de novo; and an expedition arrived at Pondicherri on the 16th September 1816, to re-enter on possession. On the 4th December 1816, Pondicherri and Chandarnagar were delivered over to them; Karikal, on the 14th January 1817; Mah\u00e9, on the 22nd February 1817; and Yanan, on the 12th April 1817. A convention between the Governments of France and England, dated 7th March 1815, regulated the conditions of their restoration. The French renounced their former right, under the convention of the 30th August 1787, to claim annually from the English East India Company 300 chests of opium at cost price, and agreed to henceforth pay the average rates realized at the Calcutta sales. They also bound themselves to make over to the English Company, at a fixed price, all surplus salt manufactured within their restored territories over and above the requirements of the local population. In compensation for these lucrative concessions, the English agreed to pay 4 lakhs of sikk\u00e1 rupees (one million francs, or, say, \u00a340,000) annually to the French Government. As it was found that the right to make salt at all in the French Settlements led to the smuggling of that article into the surrounding British Districts, the French Government were induced, on the 13th May 1818, to surrender it altogether for an annual payment of '4000 pagodas' (33,600 francs), or, say, \u00a31344. This second treaty, although\nat first made for only fifteen years, has been indefinitely prolonged; the English Government supplying the French authorities with salt at cost price, and allowing the latter to sell it to their own subjects at their own rates. A somewhat similar commutation of the opium rights for a fixed money payment has recently been proposed by the French authorities, and sanctioned by the Government of India.\n\nPresent Territories.\u2014In addition to the five Settlements already mentioned, which are treated of in separate articles, the French retain certain houses or patches of ground within British territory, in regard to which they claim certain rights.

The million francs (\u00a340,000) annually paid by the English Government in compensation for the surrender by the French authorities of their rights in regard to opium and salt, only passes through the Colonial accounts on its way to the National Exchequer, and does not appear in the above statement. Among items of expenditure may be noted\u2014law, police, and justice, \u00a39537; public works and sanitation, \u00a321,100; public instruction, public worship, etc., \u00a39734. The following table of the receipts and expenditure for each of the five Settlements is reproduced, without conversion, from the official budget for 1882:\n\n|                | RECEIPTS (1878) | EXPENDITURE (1878) | RECEIPTS (1883) | EXPENDITURE (1883) |\n|----------------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| Pondicherri    | 1,018,031       | 1,207,434          | 1,432,870       | 1,535,500          |\n| Chandarnagar   | 201,148         | 137,388            | 210,009         | 166,500            |\n| Karikal        | 400,942         | 277,204            | 443,582         | 357,355            |\n| Mah\u00e9           | 46,292          | 44,957             | 44,757          | 54,243             |\n| Yananon        | 35,627          | 33,957             | 38,482          | 56,102             |\n| **Total**      | **1,702,040**   | **1,702,040**      | **2,169,700**   | **2,169,700**      |\n\nAdministration.\u2014The military command and administration-in-chief of the French Possessions in India are vested in a Governor, whose residence is at Pondicherri. He is directly assisted by a minister of the interior, secretaries in the different administrative departments, and a principal judicial officer. In 1879, local councils and a council-general were established, the members being chosen by a species of universal suffrage within the French territories. Ten municipalities or communal boards were erected under a decree issued in 1880, namely, at Pondicherri, Oulgaret, Vallenour, Bahur, Karikal, La Grande-Ald\u00e9e,\nNedouncadou, Chandarnagar, Mah\u00e9, and Yan\u00e1on. On the municipal boards natives are entitled to a proportion of the seats. Civil and criminal courts, courts of first instance, and a court of appeal compose the judicial machinery of the possessions. The army and establishments connected with the Governor-General and his staff at Pondicherri; those of the local governors or chefs de service at Chandarnagar, Yan\u00e1on, Mah\u00e9, and Karik\u00e1l; together with other headquarters' charges, necessarily engross a large proportion of the revenue. All the state and dignity of an independent Government, with four dependent ones, have to be maintained out of a total income (1883) of \u00a386,788. This is effected by rigid economy, and the prestige of the French Government is worthily maintained in the East. Pondicherri is also the scene of considerable religious pomp and missionary activity. It forms the seat of a 'Pr\u00e9fecture Apostolique,' founded in 1828, consisting of a Pr\u00e9fet Apostolique and 7 priests for all French India; and of the 'Mission du Carnatic,' founded by the Jesuits in 1776. But the chief field of this mission lies outside the French Settlements. Of its 115,000 Christians, 160 churches, and 65 missionaries, no fewer than 92,000 of the Christians are British subjects, and 159 of the churches are in British territory. The rupee (standard value = 2 fr. 40 cents) is the only legal tender within French territories. The system of education is progressive to a satisfactory extent; in 1878, the number of children under instruction was 2877. In 1883, the Colonial College had a roll of 185 pupils. A line of railway running via Vallenour, from Pondicherri to Belpur, maintains communication with Madras and the rest of British India. The telegraph is working throughout the Settlements. A Chamber of Commerce consisting of 14 members, 9 of them Europeans or persons of European descent, has lately been reorganized. The capital, Pondicherri, is a very handsome town, and presents, especially from the sea, a striking appearance of French civilisation. It forms the head-quarters of the French national line of steam communication with the East, the excellent Messageries Maritimes; but its natural situation does not admit of any great trade. The total exports and imports for French India in 1883 were returned at \u00a31,067,009 (26,675,243 francs), of which \u00a3491,477 was with France and \u00a3575,532 with other countries, chiefly British. The number of ships entering ports in the French Settlements in 1883 was 516, with an aggregate burthen of 125,511 tons. Detailed accounts of each of the four Settlements which have ports will be found under PONDICHERRI, KARIKAL, MAHE, and YANAON.\n\nFrontier District, Sind.\u2014See UPPER SIND.\n\nFulaguri.\u2014Village in Nowgong District, Assam.\u2014See PHULAGURI.\n\nFurreed\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Town in Delhi District, Punjab.\u2014See FARIDABAD.\n\nFurreedcote.\u2014Native State in the Punjab.\u2014See FARIDKOT.\nFurreedpore.\u2014District and town in Bengal, and tahsil and town in the North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Faridpur.\n\nFyz\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Division, District, tahsil, and town in Oudh.\u2014See Faizabad.\n\nG.\n\nG\u00e1bat.\u2014Petty State in M\u00e1hi K\u00e1ntha, Bombay Presidency. Area under cultivation, 1900 acres; population (1881) 1430; estimated revenue, \u00a3317. The Th\u00e1kur of G\u00e1bat is a M\u00e1kw\u00e1na Kol\u00ed; during his minority the estate is managed by the Political Agent. The State pays a tribute of \u00a32, 10s. to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Edar. Transit dues are levied in the State.\n\nGad.\u2014Petty State in Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Garh.\n\nGad\u00e1dh\u00e1r.\u2014River in North-Eastern Bengal; tributary to the Brahmaputra. It rises among the mountains of Bh\u00fat\u00e1n, and debouches upon the plains of the Dw\u00e1rs through a picturesque gorge. The main stream of this river forms the boundary between the Western Dw\u00e1rs of Jalp\u00e1g\u00fari District, and the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs, which are included within Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1. Owing to many alterations in its course and variations in the size of the different channels, the Gad\u00e1dh\u00e1r undergoes several changes of name. The upper reaches are sometimes identified with the Sankos, which is properly the name of a separate river. After entering Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, the river bifurcates, the larger volume of water now passing into the Brahmaputra by a channel called the G\u00e1ng\u00e1dh\u00e1r. The old channel, which retains the original name, is nearly dry, and only supported by the water of a small tributary, the B\u00e1mn\u00e1i. The Gad\u00e1dh\u00e1r is navigable in the plains by boats of 4 tons burthen.\n\nGadag (Garag).\u2014Town and Sub-division in Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Garag.\n\nG\u00e1daw\u00e1r\u00e1.\u2014Western tahsil or Sub-division of Narsinghpur District, Central Provinces.

Criminal court of the pr\u00e1nt; dispensary; boys' and girls' school.\n\n**G\u00e1gar.**\u2014Range of mountains in Kum\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces, forming a portion of the outer Him\u00e1layan range; situated between lat. 29\u00b0 14' and 29\u00b0 30' E., and between long. 79\u00b0 9' and 79\u00b0 39' E. The chain runs along the whole southern border of the District, parallel to the plains, from the Kos\u00ed river to the K\u00e1li, and presents a line of higher elevation than any ranges between it and the main ridge of the central Him\u00e1layas. The principal peak is that of Ch\u00edn\u00e1, overlooking the lake and station of NAINI TAL, which nestle among the hollows of the G\u00e1gar. Forests of cypress, t\u00fan, fir, and other timber trees clothe the hill-sides. Average elevation, between 7000 and 8000 feet.\n\n**G\u00e1gl\u00e1.**\u2014Trading village and produce d\u00e9p\u00f4t in Rangpur District, Bengal, lying between the Sankos and Dharl\u00e1 rivers. Chief exports\u2014jute, tobacco, and ginger. Lat. 25\u00b0 59' N., long. 89\u00b0 40' 30\" E.\n\n**G\u00e1graun.**\u2014Town and fort in the State of Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. The fort is situated between the rivers Ahu and K\u00e1li-Sind, on a straight rocky ridge running south-east and north-west, parallel to the low range between Jhalrapatan city and cantonments. It was built by Z\u00e1l\u00edm Singh, who considered it a good military position. The town lies on a low part of the ridge, and the large fort which protects and commands it on the south-east is connected by a masonry wall. Although no objection\nis made to the town being entered, admission is forbidden inside the fort, which is separated from the town by a strong high wall, and a deep ditch cut in the solid rock crossed by a permanent stone bridge. The principal entrance to the fort is from the town. After crossing the ditch, the passage lies between two high bastions, without any gateway, ascending with high walls on either side until the great gate is reached. Inside the fort, the path skirts a large excavation in the rock intended to hold water, but often quite dry, then zig-zags into the inner works through a large gateway, when a tolerably open space is found with long lines of buildings under the walls on the right. The exit is to the south-east by a simple doorway in the wall; from this there is a descent till the end wall is reached immediately over the river; and then the path crosses a small precipice protected by ramparts, 60 or 70 feet above the ground outside, leading to the large circular bastions already mentioned. On the north-east face there is but one wall, the precipitous nature of the hill here rendering a second and lower wall unnecessary. The noticeable feature in the country around G\u00e1graun is the extreme straightness and parallelism of the two ridges, not only at the place itself, but for two or three miles on either side. Both hills and valleys are thickly wooded, and the gorge by which the river finds its way out into the open plains is very fine, high precipices alternating with wooded slopes on either side. One precipice, absolutely vertical, was plumbed and found to be 307 feet in height. This is known as the \u2018Gid Kerai\u2019 or Vulture\u2019s precipice, and, it is said, was formerly used as a place of execution by the Kot\u00e1h R\u00e1j\u00e1s, the victims being precipitated on to the rocks below. The tops of these ridges are the culminating points of the range. Wild animals abound. There are only two fairly good passes across the hills, one north of G\u00e1graun up the Amjar valley to Panwar, and the other leading to R\u00e1jpura about 2\u00bc miles farther north, both, however, impracticable for carts. During the dry season many of the rapids are fordable on foot, but dangerous.\n\n**Gahij\u00e1.** \u2014 Town in the Sakkar taluk, Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency.

Population (1881) 5404, namely, 2706 Hindus, 2696 Muhammadans, and 2 Jains. Akbar gave revenue-free grants to a number of Sayyids, whose descendants held them till 1857, when they were confiscated on account of the rebellion of their holders. The celebrated rebel, W\u00e1lid\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n of M\u00e1l\u00e1g\u00e1rh, held a half-share in the village.

Lat. 18\u00b0 30' N., long. 18\u00b0 50' E.; averaging from 2800 to 5000 feet above sea-level, about 45 miles from the sea. The two highest peaks reach a height of 5345 and 5287 feet respectively. The shape of the range is that of a double crescent joined by a narrow saddle. The summits of the range are of gneiss and syenite, capped with laterite and black mould. They are easy of access except near the top, but the road throughout has been improved by Government sappers. In 1860, the Madras Government tested this range as a sanitarium by sending up a detachment of Europeans to a site selected, and named 'Harris's Valley.' The place, however, proved unhealthy, the men suffering much from fever, and, after repeated attempts, the experiment was abandoned. It was thought, however, that a healthier site for the cantonment might have been found. The land is the property of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Vizian\u00e1garam, who has a coffee estate here.\n\nGambat.\u2014Town in Khairpur State, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Population (1881) under 2000. Formerly a centre of cotton-weaving; annual produce about 5000 pieces.\n\nGambhar.\u2014Mountain stream of the Punjab, taking its rise in the lower ranges of the Him\u00e1layas, in lat. 30\u00b0 52' N., long. 77\u00b0 8' E., and flowing in a north-westerly direction past the military station of Sub\u00e1thu, until it falls into the Sutlej (Satlaj), after a course of about 40 miles, in lat. 31\u00b0 17' N., long. 76\u00b0 47' E. It is nowhere navigable, and in the rainy season it is liable to sudden floods. The river is bridged near Sub\u00e1thu, on the road to Simla.\n\nGamb\u00edla (or Tochi).\u2014River in Bannu District, Punjab; rises in the independent hill country inhabited by the Mangal tribe of Afgh\u00e1ns. It thence flows east through the D\u00e1war valley, which it largely irrigates, and enters British territory a few miles from the town of Bannu. Its banks afford but little opportunity for cultivation, being at first composed of boulders, and afterwards of pure sand. A few irrigation cuts, however, supply water to some 12,138 acres of tilled land. It falls into the Kuram three miles below Lakki, lat. 32\u00b0 37' 30'' N., long. 71\u00b0 6' 15'' E. Sweet and wholesome drinking water. Average depth, 1\u00bd feet in the cold season, 4\u00bd feet during the rains. Nowhere bridged, but fordable at all times, except after heavy rain in the hills. The river is known as the Tochi until it reaches the Marwat tahsil, when it becomes the Gamb\u00edla. At this point are numerous springs. Four miles farther east, the Gamb\u00edla is joined by a hill torrent known as the Lohra, and\nlower down it receives much spill-water from the Kachkot Canal. All these contributions help to make the Gamb\u00edla a perennial current, but about one year in every six, owing to insufficient rain in the hills drained by the stream, irrigation from it fails, and the spring crops dry up.\n\n**Gand\u00e1i.**\u2014*Zamind\u00e1ri* or estate attached to R\u00e1ipur District, Central Provinces, at the foot of the S\u00e1letekri Hills, 56 miles north-west of R\u00e1ipur. The estate was formerly much larger; but in 1828, with the sanction of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur, it was divided among the three sons of the former holder. Area, 203 square miles. Population (1881) 20,872, namely, males 10,306, and females 10,566, residing in 77 villages, and occupying 6459 houses; average density of population, 103 persons per square mile. The *zamind\u00e1r* is a Gond. The principal village, Gand\u00e1i, at which a large weekly market is held, is situated in lat. 21\u00b0 40' 30\" N., and long. 81\u00b0 9' E. A bathing-place of some sanctity is on the southern boundary of the estate.\n\n**Gandak, Great** (known also as the *N\u00e1r\u00e1yan\u00ed* or *Salgr\u00e1mi*; the *Kondochoates* of the Greek geographers).\u2014River in the North-Western Provinces and Behar; rises high among the recesses of the Nep\u00e1l Him\u00e1layas, in lat. 30\u00b0 56' 4\" N., and long. 79\u00b0 6' 40\" E., and flowing with a general south-westward course till it reaches British territory, crosses the frontier between the District of Gorakhpur in the North-Western Provinces and the District of Champ\u00e1ran in Bengal. For some 20 miles it forms the boundary between the two Provinces, after which it flows entirely within the limits of Bengal for 40 miles farther, and then once more separates the Provinces for 12 miles of its course. Thence it enters the limits of Bengal, flowing between the Districts of Champ\u00e1ran and Muzaffarpur (T\u00edrh\u00fat) on the north-east, and S\u00e1ran on the south-west. It finally joins the Ganges just opposite Patn\u00e1, in lat. 25\u00b0 49' 53\" N., and long. 85\u00b0 13' 45\" E. The Gandak is a snow-fed stream, issuing from the hills at Triben\u00ed *gh\u00e1t*, in the north-west of Champ\u00e1ran, but it soon afterwards acquires the character of a deltaic river. Its banks generally rise above the level of the surrounding country, and floods accordingly often inundate large tracts of the low-lying land on either side. It has no tributaries in its course through the plains, and the drainage of the neighbouring region sets not towards it, but away from it. The lowest discharge of water into the Ganges, towards the end of March, amounts to 10,391 cubic feet per second; the highest recorded flood volume is 266,000 cubic feet per second. During a great part of its course, the river is enclosed by protective embankments. Where it issues from the hills it has a clear and rapid current of considerable volume, never fordable, full of rapids and whirlpools, and navigable with difficulty. Rafts of timber come down the stream from Nep\u00e1l, and these, with the\nsunken snags, render navigation perilous. Grain and sugar are sent down from Gorakhpur District; and during the rains, boats of 1000 maunds burthen can make their way up stream as far as Lalganj in Tirh\u00fat. The down traffic is more considerable than the up trade, and a register kept for four months of 1868 showed an export of 26,300 tons of produce during that period.\n\n**Gandak, Little.**\u2014River in the North-Western Provinces; rises in the Nep\u00e1l Hills, and enters Gorakhpur District about 8 miles west of the Great Gandak; flows parallel with the latter channel southward through the District, and empties itself into the Gogra (Ghagr\u00e1) at S\u00fanaria, just within the limits of S\u00e1ran in Bengal, in lat. 25\u00b0 41\u2032 N., long. 85\u00b0 14\u2032 30\u2033 E. Except in the rains, it has a small stream only 20 yards in breadth, and fordable in most places.\n\n**Gand\u00e1va.**\u2014Political capital of the Province of Kachhi, Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n, situated on the Mul\u00e1 Pass route, 40 miles south-west from B\u00e1gh. Lat. 28\u00b0 32\u2032 N., long. 67\u00b0 32\u2032 E. A fortified place, built apparently on an artificial mound. The winter residence of the Kh\u00e1n of Khel\u00e1t, whose palace was described as the only respectable edifice in the place. This building was almost entirely destroyed by the great floods of 1874. Here also is the Kh\u00e1n\u2019s garden within a walled enclosure. Only periodical visits are paid by the Kh\u00e1n to the town, and the population therefore is probably a fluctuating one.\n\n**Gandevi.**\u2014Sub-division of the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda\u2019s territory, Guzer\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency. Population (1881) 27,762 persons, or 617 to the square mile. Area, 45 square miles. Bounded on the north and west by the Jal\u00e1lpur Sub-division of Surat District, and on the east and south by the Chikhli and Bals\u00e1r Sub-divisions of the same District. Land revenue (1879\u201380), \u00a314,988. The Sub-division is for the most part flat, with but few small elevations, and not well watered. The soil is black.\n\n**Gandevi.**\u2014Town in the Gandevi Sub-division, Baroda territory, Guzer\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency, distant 3 miles from the Amals\u00e1r station of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, and 28 miles south-east of Surat. Latitude 20\u00b0 47\u2032 30\u2033 N., longitude 73\u00b0 3\u2032 E. Population (1881) 7082, namely, 4844 Hindus, 1522 Muhammadans, 662 P\u00e1ris, 53 Jains, and 1 Christian. The town is the head-quarters station of the vahiv\u00e1t\u00edd\u00e1r and the faujd\u00e1r, and contains a post-office, dispensary, and an Anglo-vernacular school. Large tank and small temple. Grain, molasses, ghi, and castor-oil are the principal articles of trade.\n\n**Gandgarh.**\u2014Range of hills in R\u00e1wal Pindi and Haz\u00e1ra Districts, Punjab, being the western portion of General Cunningham\u2019s outer or sub-Him\u00e1layan range. Lat. 33\u00b0 57\u2032 N., long. 72\u00b0 46\u2032 E. These hills take their rise in Haz\u00e1ra, and, projecting into R\u00e1wal Pindi, end in the\nlofty mountain which specially bears the name of Gandgarh. The northern escarpment toward the valley of Chach descends by gentle cultivated slopes into the fertile vale at its feet; but the remaining sides form rugged and precipitous cliffs, intersected by ravines, through which the tributaries of the little river Haroh have cut themselves deep channels.\n\n**Gandha M\u00e1dan.**\u2014One of the principal peaks in the Orissa Tributary States, Bengal; situated in Keunjhar State. Lat. 21\u00b0 38' 12\" N., long. 85\u00b0 32' 56\" E.; height, 3479 feet.\n\n**Gandhol.**\u2014Petty State in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 1 village, with 1 independent tribute-payer. Population (1881) 191. Estimated revenue, \u00a3200; tribute of \u00a310, 6s. is paid to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and 16s. to Jun\u00e1garh.\n\n**Gandikot** ('The Fort of the Gorge;' Gunjicottah).\u2014Mountain fortress in Kadapa (Cuddapah) District, Madras Presidency; situated in the Yerramal\u00e1i Mountains, 1670 feet above sea-level. Latitude 14\u00b0 48' N., longitude 78\u00b0 20' E. The fort, with its temple (endowed by the earliest of the Vijayanagar kings), was a famous stronghold in ancient days. Built (according to Ferishta) in 1589, it was captured by Golconda, and held by M\u00edr Jaml\u00e1; later it was the capital of one of the five Circars (Sark\u00e1rs) of the Karn\u00e1tic Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, until absorbed by the Path\u00e1n Naw\u00e1b of Cuddapah. It was here that Fateh Naik, the father of the great Haidar, first distinguished himself. Haidar improved and garrisoned the fort, which was captured by Captain Little in the first war with Tip\u00fa in 1791. 'The strong natural fortress of Gandikot must in olden times have been impregnable. Perched on the scarped rock that overhangs at a height of some 300 feet the winding Penn\u00e1r, this picturesque group of buildings, military and religious together, illustrate the wild secluded life which to a Hindu robber chief seemed to be grandeur. Cut off from all but those who sought (and could climb innumerable stairs) to see him, he surrounded himself at once with temples and bastions, with a crowd of priests and a rabble of soldiers; and yet no sooner was the impregnable fort attacked, than it belied its name, and yielded to treachery or fear. The fort of Gandikot was, however, one of the most important in the Cuddapah country. It was the key to the valley of the Penn\u00e1r, and its name frequently occurs in the account of ancient struggles'\u2014(Gribble). The population of Gandikot town (1881) was 973.\n\n**Ganeswari.**\u2014River in the G\u00e1ro Hills District, Assam, rising in lat. 25\u00b0 18' N., long. 90\u00b0 49' E., on the skirts of a hill called Kail\u00e1s. Its course lies southwards into Maimansingh District, through a limestone formation, in which there are some large stalactite caverns. Its rocky banks form scenery of a picturesque beauty.\n\n**Ganga B\u00e1l.**\u2014Small lake in Kashmir.\u2014See Gangal.\nGangaikand\u00e1pur (Gang\u00e1-kanda-puram (Tamil), \u2018The city visited by the Ganges,\u2019 from a well in the temple mythically connected with the Ganges; sometimes also called Gang\u00e1kondu Sol\u00e1ipur, or \u2018The city of the Chola king, Gang\u00e1i\u2019).\u2014Town and temple in Trichinopoli District, Madras Presidency. Situated in latitude $11^\\circ 12'30''$ N., longitude $79^\\circ 30'$ E., about 6 miles to the east of J\u00e1iamkondu Sol\u00e1puram; connected with Udaiyar-polaiy\u00e1m by the Chellambaram road, and 1 mile distant from the great Trunk Road running from Tanjore to South Arcot. The village is purely agricultural, 66 per cent. of the population being cultivators. Close to the village is one of the most remarkable but least known temples in Southern India. The building consists of one large enclosure, measuring 584 feet by 372. This was evidently once well fortified by a strong surrounding stone wall, with batteries at each corner. In 1836, however, the batteries were almost entirely destroyed, and the wall removed, to provide materials for the dam across the river Coleroon known as the Lower Anicut, which was then under construction. In the place of the old wall, a low one of stone has been built on two sides of the enclosure, but the other sides have been left open. The vimana in the centre of the courtyard is a very conspicuous building, and strikes the eye from a great distance. The pyramid surrounding it reaches a height of 174 feet. The ruins of six gopuras, or gate pyramids, surmount different parts of the building. That over the eastern entrance to the main enclosure was evidently once a very fine structure, being built entirely of stone except at the very top. It is now almost completely in ruins. All the lower part of the centre building is covered with inscriptions, which have not as yet been deciphered. Dr. Caldwell is of opinion that this temple is one of the great, if not the greatest, of present Hindu temples, and that the old and splendid temple of Tanjore is probably merely a model of it. Tradition says that the village was once one of the principal seats of the Chola kings; and there is no doubt that it was formerly a much more important place than it now is. Northward from its site runs an embankment 16 miles long, provided with several substantial sluices, and of great strength, which in former times must have formed one of the largest reservoirs in India. This huge tank or lake was filled partly by a channel from the Coleroon river, upwards of 60 miles in length, which enters it at its southern end; and partly by a smaller channel from the Vell\u00e1r, which entered it on the north. Traces of both these channels still remain. The tank has been ruined and useless for very many years, and its bed is now almost wholly overgrown with high and thick jungle. It is said, traditionally, that its ruin was wilful, and the act of an invading army. \u2018All round the Pagoda and village, but completely overgrown with jungle, are some remains of ancient buildings, now much resembling the mounds or \u201cheaps\u201d which indicate the site of ancient Babylon, but in which the village elders\npoint out the various parts of an extensive and magnificent palace. When this palace was in existence, Gang\u00e1-kanda-puram was the wealthy and flourishing capital of a small monarchy; and the great tank spread fertility and industry over miles and miles of what is now trackless forest' (Pharaoh). It has more than once been projected to restore this magnificent work, and to supply it by a channel from the Upper Anicut.\n\n**Gangal.**\u2014Tank or small lake in Kashmir State; on the Harmukh mountain, near the north-eastern boundary of the valley. Latitude $34^\\circ 37'$ N., longitude $74^\\circ 58'$ E. Length, $1\\frac{1}{2}$ mile; breadth, 300 yards. Remarkable only for its sanctity in the eyes of the Hindus, who make pilgrimages to its banks, and throw into the waters such fragments of the bones of their relatives as remain unconsumed after the funeral cremation. Large temple sacred to Siva in his form of Mah\u00e1deva. An annual fair is held here.\n\n**Gang\u00e1pur.**\u2014Town in Jaipur State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Population (1881) 5880, namely, 5264 Hindus, 534 Muhammadans, and 82 'others.'\n\n**Gangaru.**\u2014Town in Muzaffarnagar District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See GANGIRU.\n\n**Gang\u00e1wali.**\u2014Seaport at the mouth of the Gang\u00e1wali river, North K\u00e1nara District, Bombay Presidency. Latitude $14^\\circ 36'$ N., longitude $74^\\circ 21'$ E. Population (1881) 982. In the Ankola customs' division. Imports for eight years ending 1881-82 averaged \u00a3418, and exports \u00a32063. Famous temple to the goddess Ganga, wife of Siva. The site also of a timber depot under the Forest Department.\n\n**Ganges.**\u2014The great river of Northern India, formed by the drainage of the southern ranges of the Him\u00e1layas. This magnificent stream, which in its lower course supplies the river system of Bengal, rises in the Garhw\u00e1l State, in lat. $30^\\circ 56' 4''$ N., and long. $79^\\circ 6' 40''$ E., and falls into the Bay of Bengal after a course of 1557 miles. It issues under the name of the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed from an ice-cave at the foot of an Him\u00e1layan snow-bed above Gangotri, 13,800 feet above the level of the sea. During its earlier passage through the southern spurs of the Him\u00e1layas, it receives the Jahn\u00e1vi from the north-west, and subsequently the Alak-nanda, after which the united stream takes the name of the Ganges. Deo Prayag, the point of junction, is a celebrated place of pilgrimage, as is also Gangotri, the source of the parent stream. At Sukhi it pierces through the Him\u00e1layas, and turns south-west to Hardwar, also a place of great sanctity. Thence it proceeds by a tortuous course through the Districts of Dehra D\u00fan, Sah\u00e1ranpur, Muzaffarnagar, Bulandshahr; and Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, in which last District it receives the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1. At Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d the type of the river changes. Heretofore, the Ganges has been little more than a series of shoals, pools, and rapids, except, of course, during the melting of the snows and the rainy season. At\nAllah\u00e1b\u00e1d, however, 668 miles from its source, it receives the Jumna, a mighty confluent, which also takes its rise in the Him\u00e1layas, to the west of the sources of the Ganges. The combined river winds eastward by south-east through the North-Western Provinces, receiving the G\u00famti and the Gogra. The point of junction of each of these streams has more or less claim to sanctity. But the tongue of land at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, where the Jumna and the Ganges join, is the true Pray\u00e1g, the place of pilgrimage, to which hundreds of thousands of devout Hindus repair to wash away their sins in the sacred river. Here is held, every twelfth year, the great kumbh fair (mela), when the planet Jupiter is in Aquarius (kumbh), and the sun in Aries. The last kumbh mela, in 1882, was attended by from 800,000 to 1,000,000 persons. Pilgrims came from all parts of India, from Kashmir and Madras, and from Kandah\u00e1r and Calcutta. The fair began on the first day of M\u00e1gh (5th January), and lasted till the full moon of that month on the 3rd February. The most strict observers keep the whole month as a period of sanctity, bathing daily at the confluence of the two rivers, fasting by day, and altogether abstaining from all but the commonest food. Such devotees are called kalap-b\u00e1shi (good-livers).\n\nOf all great rivers of India, none can compare in sanctity with the Ganges, or Mother Gang\u00e1, as she is affectionately called by devout Hindus. From her source in the Him\u00e1layas to her mouth in the Bay of Bengal, every foot of her course is holy ground; and many of the other sacred rivers of India borrow their sanctity from a supposed underground connection with her waters. It is interesting to observe that this superstition is not to be found in the earliest books of Sanskrit literature, composed at a time when the primitive Aryan race had not yet penetrated into the great plain of Eastern Hindustan. The legend of the Ganges first appears in the two epic poems of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata and R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, and affords abundant scope for the mytho-poetic faculty subsequently displayed in the voluminous literature of the Pur\u00e1\u00f1as. In this legend, which admits of numerous variations, the three supreme gods of the Hindu Pantheon\u2014Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva\u2014each perform a conspicuous part, so that the Ganges has been preserved from sectarian associations. The human dramatis personae in the story are localized as princes of Ayodhya, the modern Oudh. Gang\u00e1 herself is described as the daughter of the Him\u00e1layas, who is persuaded, after infinite solicitation, to shed her purifying stream upon the sinful earth. The ice-cavern beneath the glacier at Gangotri, from which the river springs, is represented as the tangled hair of the god Siva. The names of Bhagirathi and Sag\u00e1r have a prominent place in the legend.\n\nAfter the lapse of twenty centuries, and the rise and fall of rival religions, veneration for the Ganges still figures as a chief article in\nthe creed of modern Hinduism. The pre-eminently sacred spots on its banks\u2014Gangotri, Hardwar, Allahabad, Benares, and Sagar Island at its mouth\u2014are frequented by thousands of pilgrims from every Province of the peninsula. Even at the present day, the six years' pilgrimage from the source to the mouth, and back again, known as Pradakshina, is performed by many; and a few fanatical devotees may yet be seen wearily accomplishing this meritorious penance by 'measuring their length.' To bathe in the Ganges, especially at the great stated festivals, will wash away the stain of sin; and those who have thus purified themselves carry back bottles of the sacred water to their less fortunate relations. To die and be buried on the river bank is a passport to eternal bliss. Even to exclaim 'Gang\u00e1, Gang\u00e1,' at the distance of a hundred leagues, will atone for the sins committed during three previous lives.\n\nThe river thus reverenced by the Hindus deserves their homage by reason of its exceptional utility for agriculture and navigation. None of the other rivers of India approach the Ganges in beneficence. The Brahmaputra and the Indus may have longer streams, as measured by the geographer, but the upper courses of both lie hidden within the unknown recesses of the Himalayas. Not one of the great rivers of Central or Southern India is navigable in the proper sense of the term. The Ganges begins to distribute fertility as soon as it reaches the plains, within 200 miles of its sources; and at the same point it becomes in some sort navigable. Thenceforwards it rolls majestically down to the sea in a bountiful stream, which never becomes a merely destructive torrent in the rains, and never dwindles away in the hottest summer. If somewhat diminished by irrigation, its volume is forthwith restored by numerous great tributaries; and the wide area of its river basin receives annually a sufficient rainfall to maintain the supply in every part. Embankments are in few places required to restrain its inundations, for the alluvial silt which it spills over its banks year by year affords to the fields a top-dressing of inexhaustible fertility. If one crop be drowned by the flood, the cultivator calculates that his second crop will abundantly requite him.\n\nShortly after passing the holy city of Benares, the Ganges enters Behar, and after receiving an important tributary, the Son (Soane), from the south, passes Patn\u00e1, and obtains another accession to its volume from the Gandak, which rises in Nep\u00e1l. Farther to the east, it receives the Kusi, and then, skirting the R\u00e1jmahal Hills, turns sharply to the southward, passing near the site of the ruined city of Gaur. By this time it has approached to within 240 miles, as the crow flies, from the sea. About 20 miles farther on, it begins to branch out over the level country, and this spot marks the commencement of the Delta, 220 miles in a straight line, or nearly 300 by the windings of the\nriver, from the Bay of Bengal. The main channel takes the name of the Padm\u00e1 or Padda, and proceeds in a south-easterly direction, past Pabn\u00e1 to Go\u00e1land\u00e1, where it is joined by the Jamun\u00e1, or main stream of the Brahmaputra. The vast confluence of waters rushes towards the sea, receiving further additions from the hill country on the east, and forming a broad estuary known under the name of the Meghna, which enters the Bay of Bengal near No\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed. This estuary, however, is only the largest and most easterly of a great number of mouths or channels. The most westerly is the Hugli, which receives the waters of the three westernmost distributary channels that start from the parent Ganges in or near Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d District. Between the H\u00fagl\u00ed on the west and the Meghn\u00e1 on the east, lies the Delta. The upper angle of it consists of rich and fertile Districts, such as Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, Nadiy\u00e1, Jessor, and the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s. But towards its southern base, resting on the sea, the country sinks into a series of great swamps, intersected by a network of innumerable channels. This wild waste is known as the Sundarbans, from the sundr\u00ed tree, which grows in abundance in the seaboard tracts. The most important channel for navigation is the H\u00fagl\u00ed, on which stands Calcutta, about 80 miles from the mouth. Above this city, the navigation is almost entirely conducted by native craft; the modern facilities for traffic by rail, and the increasing shoals in the river, having put an end to the previous steamer communication, which plied until about 1860 to as high up as Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. In the upper portion of its course in the North-Western Provinces, timber and bamboos form the bulk of the river trade; and in the lower part bordering on Bengal, stone, grain, and cotton. Below Calcutta, important boat-routes through the Delta connect the H\u00fagl\u00ed with the eastern branches of the river, both for native craft and steamers. The Ganges is essentially a river of great cities: Calcutta, Monghyr, Patn\u00e1, Benares lie on its course below its union with the Jumna, and Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d at the junction of the two rivers.\n\nTill within a recent period, the magnificent stream of the Ganges formed almost the sole channel of traffic between Upper India and the seaboard. The products not only of the river valley, but even the cotton of the Central Provinces, used formerly to be conveyed by this route to Calcutta. But though the opening of the railway has caused a revolution in the channels of trade, heavy goods in bulk still follow the old means of communication; and the Ganges may yet rank as one of the most frequented waterways in the world. In 1877-78, the total imports from the interior into Calcutta were valued at 36 millions sterling, of which 17 millions came via the Gangetic channels; country boats carrying more than 14 millions, and river steamers (chiefly from the eastwards) 3 millions. The downward traffic, as might be expected,\nis most brisk in the rainy season, when the river comes down in flood. During the rest of the year the boats make their way back up-stream, often without cargoes, either helped by a favourable wind or laboriously towed along the bank. The dimensions of the river traffic of Bengal may be inferred from the following figures, which give the number of boats passing certain registration stations in 1876-77:\u2014At B\u00e1mangh\u00e1t\u00e1, on the Circular Canal, 178,627 boats, of which 59,495 were laden; at H\u00fagl\u00ed, 124,357, of which 73,233 were laden; at Patn\u00e1, 61,571, of which 44,384 were laden; at Go\u00e1land\u00e1, 54,329, of which 42,249 were laden; at S\u00e1hibganj, 43,020, of which 30,798 were laden.\n\nThe river trade of Bengal with the North-Western Provinces and Oudh will be seen from the following statistics for 1877-78:\u2014Imports into Bengal via the Ganges\u2014oil-seeds, 2,619,818 maunds; food-grains, 952,521 maunds; sugar, 970,132 maunds; cotton, 40,192 maunds: total of the four items, 4,582,663 maunds or 197,759 tons. Exports from Bengal\u2014food-grains (chiefly rice), 2,299,797 maunds; salt, 481,820 maunds: total of these two items, 2,781,617 maunds or 101,827 tons. Total of the foregoing items, upwards and downwards, 7,364,280 maunds or 269,586 tons. Those figures, however, comprise but a portion of the river-borne traffic of the Ganges. Among other commodities in the down-stream traffic may be mentioned\u2014(1) Timber and wood from the Bijnaur (Bijnor) forests to Garhmukhtesar and An\u00fapshahr, for transport to Agra and Delhi by road, estimated at 20,000 maunds; (2) Ditto, via the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 and Garra rivers to Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, Cawnpur, and Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, 199,000 maunds; (3) Grain and oil-seeds, from wharves west of Cawnpur to Cawnpur and Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, 258,000 maunds; (4) Salt, from Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, Cawnpur, and Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, to wharves in the Benares Division, and to Patn\u00e1 in Bengal, 60,000 maunds; (5) Cotton from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d and M\u00edrz\u00e1pur to Benares and Patn\u00e1, 59,000 maunds; (6) Stone, from wharves in M\u00edrz\u00e1pur District, to Bengal, 450,000 maunds, and many other articles of agricultural produce and commerce. In the up-stream traffic, the only noticeable point is the import of rice from H\u00e1jipur and Satna wharves in Benares. Articles of European commerce, such as wheat, indigo, cotton, and saltpetre, mostly prefer the railway, as also do the imports of Manchester piece-goods. But if we take into consideration the new development of the export trade in oil-seeds, and the growing increase in the interchange of food-grains between various parts of the country, it seems probable that the actual amount of traffic on the Ganges by native craft has not at all diminished since the opening of the railway; and the river is not only a rival, but also a feeder to the railway. Stations favourably situated on its banks form centres of collection and distribution for the surrounding country. Such cities as Cawnpur, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, Benares, and Patn\u00e1 have thus\nbeen able to preserve their former importance, while fishing villages like S\u00e1hibganj and Go\u00e1land\u00e1 have by the same means been raised into river marts of the first magnitude.\n\nThe catchment basin of the Ganges and its tributaries is bounded on the north by a section of about 700 miles of the Him\u00e1layan range, on the south by the Vindhya mountains, and on the east by the ranges which separate Bengal from Burma. The vast river basin thus enclosed embraces 391,100 square miles. The flood discharge of the Ganges at R\u00e1jmahal, after it has received all its important tributaries, was formerly estimated at 1,350,000 cubic feet of water per second. Latest calculation: length of main stream of Ganges, 1509 miles by the H\u00fagl\u00ed route, or 1557 to the Meghn\u00e1 mouth, or with its longest affluent, 1680; breadth at entrance to the sea, 20 miles; breadth of channel in dry season, 1\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) to 2\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) miles; depth in dry season, 30 feet; high-flood discharge at R\u00e1jmahal, 1,800,000 cubic feet per second; ordinary discharge, 207,000 cubic feet; longest duration of flood, about 40 days. Average discharge at Hardw\u00e1r, when the river is at its lowest, 7000 cubic feet per second; at Benares, 19,000 cubic feet per second. At the point at which it issues from its snow-bed, the Ganges is 27 feet broad and 15 inches deep, 13,800 feet above sea-level. At Gangotri, 10 miles lower, it is 43 feet broad and 18 inches deep; elevation, 10,319 feet. At Bh\u00e1irogh\u00e1ti, the river is 8511 feet above sea-level; at Deo Pray\u00e1g, at its confluence with the Alaknand\u00e1, 133 miles from its source, 1953 feet; at Hardw\u00e1r, 1024 feet; and at Cawnpur, 379 feet above sea-level. Average fall from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d to Benares, 6 inches per mile; from Benares to Calcutta, between 4 and 5 inches; from Calcutta to the sea, 1 to 2 inches. The total length of the stream in its different stages, from the source of the Jahnavi to the H\u00fagl\u00ed mouth is returned as follows:\u2014From the source of the Jahnavi to the junction of the Alaknand\u00e1 and Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed rivers, 133 miles; thence to Hardw\u00e1r, 47 miles; thence to Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, at its confluence with the Jumna, 488 miles; thence to Sibganj, where the H\u00fagl\u00ed channel commences in a branch thrown off from the main stream, known as the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed, 563 miles; thence to the junction of the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed and Jalang\u00ed, below which the stream takes the name of the H\u00fagl\u00ed, 120 miles; thence to Chandarnagar, 48 miles; thence to the sea by way of Calcutta, 110 miles: total, 1509 miles. The length from Chandarnagar to the sea may be variously stated from 100 to 150 miles, according to the point in the estuary at which the sea is reckoned to commence. The distance here taken (110 miles) ends at the S\u00e1g\u00e1r anchoring buoy. The water of the Ganges begins to rise towards the end of May, and is usually at its maximum in September. The following table, drawn up by Captain Thomas Prinsep (quoted from Thornton), illustrates the rise of water in the river at various places:\u2014\nGreatest known Annual Rise.\n\n| Location          | Ft. | In. |\n|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| At Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d      | 45  | 6   |\n| \u201e Benares         | 45  | 0   |\n| \u201e Colgong         | 29  | 6   |\n| \u201e Jalangi         | 26  | 0   |\n| \u201e (according to Rennell) | 32 | 0   |\n| \u201e Kum\u00e1rh\u00e1l\u00ed (not quite certain) | 22 | 6   |\n| \u201e Agradw\u00edp (Nadiy\u00e1) | 23 | 9   |\n| \u201e Calcutta (independent of tide) | 7  | 0   |\n| \u201e Dacca (according to Rennell) | 14 | 0   |\n\nRise in low Seasons.\n\n| Location          | Ft. | In. |\n|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| At Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d      | 29  | 0   |\n| \u201e Benares         | 34  | 0   |\n| \u201e Colgong         | 28  | 3   |\n| \u201e Jalangi         | 25  | 6   |\n| \u201e (according to Rennell) | ... |     |\n| \u201e Kum\u00e1rh\u00e1l\u00ed (not quite certain) | 22 | 0   |\n| \u201e Agradw\u00edp (Nadiy\u00e1) | 23 | 0   |\n| \u201e Calcutta (independent of tide) | 6  | 7   |\n| \u201e Dacca (according to Rennell) | ... |     |\n\nGreat changes take place from time to time in the river-bed, and alter the face of the country. Extensive islands are thrown up, and attach themselves to the bank; while the river deserts its old bed and seeks a new channel, it may be many miles off. Such changes are so rapid and on so vast a scale, and the corroding power of the current on the bank so irresistible, that it is considered perilous to build any structure of a large or permanent character on the margin. Many decayed or ruined cities attest the alterations in the river-bed in ancient times; and within our own days, the main channel which formerly passed R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l has turned away from it, and left the town high and dry, 7 miles from the bank. The scheme of this Gazetteer is to deal with India by its administrative divisions; and much information regarding the Ganges will be found in the articles on the Districts, cities, etc., along its route. For example, a very full account will be given of the Hugli River, the great commercial mouth of the Ganges. To save repetition, therefore, the foregoing notice only attempts a general description of the course of the river.\n\n**Ganges Canal** (technically the Upper Ganges Canal).\u2014An important irrigation work and navigable channel in the North-Western Provinces, passing through the eastern portion of the Upper Do\u00e1b, and watering a large tract of country, from Hardw\u00e1r to N\u00e1nun, near Akbar\u00e1b\u00e1d in Al\u00edgarh District, where it divides into two branches, known as the Et\u00e1wah and Cawnpur terminal lines. The Upper Canal is considered to terminate at the regulating bridges of Gop\u00e1lpur and Jeyra, 33 and 39 miles respectively from N\u00e1nun, where the Lower Canal joins the branches. The lower portion of the branches thence become a portion of the Lower Canal. The plan for this great work originated in the success of the Eastern Jumna Canal, coupled with the periodical recurrence of drought and famine in the opposite half of the Do\u00e1b, which remained unprotected by the distributaries from that main channel of irrigation. Attention was thus directed to the Ganges as affording a constant water-supply for a similar undertaking, which should irrigate the eastern portion of the Do\u00e1b, from the Siw\u00e1lik Hills to Cawnpur District. As early as 1827, Captain Debude had proposed\na plan for utilizing the waters of the West K\u00e1l\u00ed N\u00e1d\u00ed, along an ancient line through the Districts of Meerut, Bulandshahr, and Aligarh; but as practical difficulties would have prevented the realization of this scheme, Colonel Colvin in 1836 recommended the examination of the Ganges in the neighbourhood of Hardw\u00e1r, where it emerges upon the plains from a gorge of the Siw\u00e1l\u00edks. The terrible famine of 1837\u201338, which shortly afterwards devastated the Do\u00e1b, and caused an enormous loss of life and revenue, directed the thoughts of our Government towards the desirability of providing against similar calamities in future. In 1839, Major (afterwards Sir) Proby Cautley was deputed to inspect the Hardw\u00e1r lowlands, and on his report a committee was appointed to investigate the question. On the 16th of April 1842, the actual works were commenced by opening the excavation between Kankhal and Hardw\u00e1r. After many delays, caused by administrative changes or alterations of engineering plans, the Ganges Canal in its earliest form was opened on the 8th of April 1854. In 1866, a committee was appointed to consider the advisability of further modifications; and their deliberations resulted in the construction of several new works, and the continuance of the main line towards Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, by means of a cut from R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t, known as the Lower Ganges Canal.\n\nThe canal, as at present constituted, derives its supplies from the Ganges at Hardw\u00e1r. The main channel then proceeds through the Districts of Sah\u00e1ranpur and Muzaffarnagar, giving off the Fatehgarh or An\u00fapshahr branch in the latter District. Thence it sweeps in a bold curve westward, across the headwaters of the K\u00e1l\u00ed N\u00e1d\u00ed, and through the heart of Meerut District. Near Begam\u00e1b\u00e1d it trends south-eastward, through Bulandshahr and Aligarh, and, as stated above, near Akbar\u00e1b\u00e1d divides into two branches, terminating respectively at Et\u00e1wah and Cawnpur. The An\u00fapshahr branch, which leaves the main channel in Muzaffarnagar District, proceeds almost parallel with the Ganges through the whole western edge of the Upper Do\u00e1b. The Et\u00e1wah branch, leaving the main line at Akbar\u00e1b\u00e1d, is joined by the Lower Ganges Canal at Jeyr\u00e1, 39 miles from Akbar\u00e1b\u00e1d, and at this point the Upper Canal is held to end. The length of the main canal amounts to 445 miles. The branches vary much from time to time, as new portions are opened or old channels disused.\n\nThe capital expenditure on the canal up to 31st March 1883, amounted to \u00a32,767,538; and the total ultimate cost is estimated at \u00a32,848,442 for direct outlay only, i.e. exclusive of interest. The capital outlay, inclusive of interest, was returned at \u00a32,826,480 in 1875\u201376. This includes a sum of \u00a370,000 for a navigation canal to connect the Ganges Canal near Gh\u00e1zi\u00e1b\u00e1d with the Agra Canal by means of the Hindan river. The total gross income from the Upper Ganges Canal received in cash during the year ending 31st March\n1883, was \u00a3235,148; besides an indirect revenue of \u00a344,301. The current outlay (charged to revenue) during the year was \u00a388,061, and the allowance for interest, \u00a3103,541. Total charges, \u00a3191,602; leaving a 'net surplus' of \u00a387,847.\n\nIt may be interesting to compare these totals with those of 1875\u201376, for which year full returns were given in the first edition of this work. The total revenue in 1875\u201376, directly or indirectly due to the canal, was returned at \u00a3289,925; of which sum \u00a3212,881 consisted of direct payments for water-rates, navigation, etc.; while \u00a377,043 was produced by increased land revenue, through the influence of irrigation. The aggregate amount of annual income realized from the opening of the canal to the end of the year 1875\u201376, amounted to \u00a32,652,009, a sum which hardly falls short of the original capital outlay. Out of this amount, \u00a32,330,190 consisted of direct income from rates, etc.; while \u00a3321,819 was due to increased land revenue. Against these figures must be set the working expenses, which amounted to \u00a3105,462 during 1875\u201376; and to \u00a31,400,982 during the whole period from the opening of the canal up to the end of that year. These figures show that the net revenue to the end of 1875\u201376 amounted to \u00a3929,207, exclusive of the increased land revenue; and to \u00a31,251,027, inclusive of increased land revenue. Against the net profit thus calculated must be set a sum of \u00a32,419,912, as charge for interest on capital outlay to the end of the year, being at the rate of 5 per cent. up to 1870\u201371, and 4\u00bd per cent. since that date. The difference between the net revenue and the interest charge, up to the end of 1875\u201376, leaves an adverse balance of \u00a31,490,704, excluding the increased land revenue, and \u00a31,168,885, including land revenue. The following statement shows the actual work accomplished during the year 1875\u201376:\u2014Average water-supply at R\u00fark\u00ed (Roorkee) in cubic feet per second, kharif 5235, rabi 4868; area irrigated in acres, kharif 317,325, rabi 571,842\u2014total, 889,167; area irrigated per cubic foot of supply, 178 acres; length of distributaries open, 3,386 miles; area irrigated per mile of distributary, 262 acres; water-rate, \u00a3202,813.\n\nIn 1882\u201383, the total area irrigated was 856,035 acres, as follows:\u2014\n\nKharif\u2014rice, 51,387 acres; cotton, 20,558 acres; indigo and other dyes, 141,425 acres; and fodder-crops, 7558 acres. R\u00e1b\u00ed\u2014wheat, 342,663 acres; other food-grains, 165,843 acres; oil-seeds, 140 acres; and fibres, 2546 acres. Miscellaneous crops\u2014sugar-cane, 109,261 acres; opium, 110 acres; other drugs, 1741 acres; garden produce, 8912 acres; and miscellaneous, 5548 acres.\n\nThe falls along the canal have been utilized in part as a motive power for mills, but much of the available power has never yet been employed. Navigation takes place along the entire length of the\nmain canal, and consists in the rafting of timber, or the carrying of merchandise in boats. The rafting is almost entirely confined to the upper portion of the main channel, as far as the point opposite Meerut. The number of boats plying in 1875-76 amounted to 325. Further details as to the agricultural benefits derived from the canal, the principal distributaries, the crops specially irrigated, and the effects of percolation, will be found under the District notices of Sah\u00e1ranpur, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Muttra, Etah, M\u00e1inpur\u00ed, Et\u00e1wah, Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Cawnpur, all of which see separately.\n\n**Ganges Canal, Lower.**\u2014An important irrigation work in the North-Western Provinces, designed to water the whole southern portion of the Do\u00e1b. The new channel may be regarded as a southward extension of the Ganges Canal, with which it has direct communication. The headworks draw their supply from the river at Naror\u00e1 (lat. 27\u00b0 47' N., long. 78\u00b0 18' E.), on the border of Aligarh District, about 4 miles below the Rajgh\u00e1t station of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. The present work owes its origin to a committee appointed in 1866 to examine the various projects for strengthening the irrigating power of the Ganges Canal; but the scheme originally adopted is due to the joint efforts of General Strachey, C.S.I., Mr. R. Forrest, Major Jeffreys, and Colonel Brownlow. Under their design, which was afterwards modified, the water for the canal was to be raised at the point above mentioned, with a discharge fixed at 3500 cubic feet per second in the cold weather, and 6500 cubic feet in the rains.\n\nThe main channel commences with a bottom width of 216 feet, a slope of 6 inches per mile, and a full supply depth of 10 feet. The main line crosses the K\u00e1l\u00ed N\u00e1di at Nadr\u00e1i, and the Isan to the west of Etah. Thence, proceeding by what was formerly called the 'Supply Branch' in the original project, it crosses the Cawnpur branch at Gop\u00e1lpur, and the Et\u00e1wah branch at Jeyra, being united with those branches by means of regulating bridges. After crossing the two lines, it proceeds direct to Shekho\u00e1b\u00e1d, where it makes a sharp turn to the south-east, and after running parallel with the East Indian Railway, which crosses it twice, as far as Et\u00e1wah, it proceeds past Sik\u00e1ndra and Bhognipur in the south-west portion of Cawnpur District, until it falls into the Jumna at a point a little above the tail of the Et\u00e1wah branch. This latter portion of the canal from Jeyra downwards is called the Bhognipur branch. Two other branches take off from the upper portion, the Fatehgarh branch, and the Beaw\u00e1r branch, which is really the upper portion of the main line of the original project now cut short at the place where it was intended to have crossed the Cawnpur branch. The proposal to extend the canal to Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, which was a part of the original project, though not entirely abandoned, will probably not be\ncarried out, and forms no part of the scheme as at present sanctioned. Should the extension at some future time be resolved on, it would be by a prolongation of the Cawnpur branch, which it has been resolved to extend to Fatehpur, half-way between Cawnpur and Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. The canal scheme, as revised, is intended for a discharge of 5100 cubic feet per second in the rains, and 3400 cubic feet in the cold weather. The only navigable portion of the canal is the length of main line from the head at Naror\u00e1 to the junction with the two branch lines at Gop\u00e1lpur and Jeyra.\n\nThree divisions of the work were set on foot during the year 1873-74, at Naror\u00e1, K\u00e1sganj, and Bhong\u00e1on, comprising the necessary preparations for 107 miles of main canal and 24 miles of supply channel. The chief engineering feat of the upper portion consists in the weir and headworks at Naror\u00e1, which include a solid wall 3800 feet in length, with a section of 10 feet by 9, having 42 weir-sluices, founded on rows of huge square blocks. Among other important works now completed may be mentioned the approach to the canal head from the river, the embankment and aqueduct across the K\u00e1l\u00ed N\u00e1di, the double regulator at the Cawnpur branch crossing 12 large bridges, and 3 syphon culverts for cross drainage. The Cawnpur and Et\u00e1wah branches were first opened for irrigation in November 1878.\n\nThe revised scheme will bring under irrigation 457,575 acres of land in the khar\u00edf or autumn harvest, and 369,300 acres in the rabi or spring harvest, as a maximum attainable in course of time. In 1882-83, the area actually under irrigation from the Lower Ganges Canal was 606,017 acres, as follows:\u2014Khar\u00edf\u2014rice, 11,095 acres; cotton, 508 acres; indigo and other dyes, 150,576 acres; and fodder-crops, 312 acres. Rabi\u2014wheat, 193,358 acres; other food-grains, 193,019 acres; and fibres, 1 acre. Miscellaneous crops\u2014sugar-cane, 24,291 acres; opium, 16,122 acres; other drugs, 282 acres; garden produce, 5962 acres; and miscellaneous, 10,491 acres.\n\nThe original scheme embraced in all 555 miles of new trunk lines, estimated at a total cost of \u00a31,825,845; and if we add to this sum the primary cost of the Cawnpur and Et\u00e1wah branches, now absorbed by the new project, the capital account would rise to \u00a32,226,523. The total gross income from the Lower Ganges Canal received in cash during the year ending the 31st March 1883 was \u00a3156,817, besides an indirect revenue of \u00a320,783. The current outlay (charged to revenue) during the year was \u00a366,638, and the allowance for interest, \u00a394,177. \u2018Net surplus,\u2019 \u00a316,785. Estimates return the future gross income at \u00a3273,600; and the net income at \u00a3169,200, giving a direct profit of 6\u00b71 per cent. From these approximate figures, and the actual cost of the Ganges Canal, it would seem that the total ultimate outlay on\nthis great united system of protective irrigation will probably not exceed the sum of \\(5\\frac{3}{4}\\) millions sterling.\n\nIn estimating the probable financial results of this, as of other Indian canals, it must be remembered that, besides the direct benefits from water dues, navigation fees, etc., and the indirect benefits from increased land revenue or other taxes, the canal irrigation acts as an insurance against famine, thus preventing great ultimate loss to the treasury, and affording a means of safety for thousands among the poorer population in seasons of drought. For further particulars, see Cawnpur, Etawah, Farukhabad, Fatehpur, and Mainpuri Districts.\n\n**Gangiru.**\u2014Town and agricultural centre in Muzaffarnagar District, North-Western Provinces, situated 35 miles south-west of Muzaffarnagar town, in lat. \\(29^\\circ 18'\\) N., long. \\(77^\\circ 15' 30''\\) E. Population (1881) 5275, namely, 2377 Hindus, 2621 Muhammadans, and 277 Jains. Area, 102 acres.

Area of town site, 99 acres. Consists of an old and a new quarter, the former founded by the legendary hero, Raja Gang, from whom the town derives its name, and the latter by the Muhammadan saint, Shaikh Abdul Kaddus, who gives his title to the western suburb, where his tomb still stands in the midst of many other sacred shrines. Surrounded by groves of mango and other trees; narrow, tortuous streets, now paved and drained with brick-work; good water; public health generally above the average. School-house, charitable dispensary, police station, post-office. Little trade; prosperity confined to money-lenders. During the Mutiny, Gangoh was frequently threatened by the rebel Gujars under the self-styled Raja Fathna; but Mr. H. D. Robertson and Lieutenant Boisragon attacked and utterly defeated them towards the end of June 1857. For police and conservancy purposes, a house-rate is levied under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856. Income in 1881-82, \u00a3325, being at the rate of 6\u00bdd. per head of population.\n\n**Gangotri.**\u2014Mountain temple in Garhwal State, North-Western Provinces. Lat. \\(30^\\circ 59'\\) N., long. \\(78^\\circ 59'\\) E. Stands on the right bank of the Bhagirathi or Ganges, 8 miles from its source, in a small bay or inlet, surrounded by a wall of unhewn stone. The temple is a square building, about 20 feet high, containing small statues of Gang\u00e1, Bh\u00e1girathi, and other mythological personages connected with the spot. Pilgrims visit the shrine as the goal of their journey, regarding this point as the source of the holy river; but no houses exist for their\naccommodation, and comparatively few reach so far up the course of the stream. Flasks filled at Gangotri with the sacred water are sealed by the officiating Brahmins, and conveyed to the plains as valuable treasures. Elevation above sea-level, about 10,319 feet.\n\n**G\u00e1ngpur.**\u2014Native State of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, Bengal, situated between lat. 21\u00b0 47' 5\" and 22\u00b0 32' 20\" N., and between long. 85\u00b0 10' 15\" and 85\u00b0 34' 35\" E. Bounded on the north by Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 District and the State of Jashpur; on the south by the States of Bon\u00e1i, Sambalpur, and B\u00e1mr\u00e1; on the east by Singhbh\u00fam District; and on the west by R\u00e1igarh, a chiefship of the Central Provinces. Area, 2484 square miles. Population (1881) 107,965.\n\nG\u00e1ngpur State consists of a tangled mass of hills and jungle, the only open portions being the valleys of the Ib, Sankh, and South Koel rivers. In these valleys there is a considerable amount of good soil; but the hills, which run in spurs from the northern and southern ranges in the valleys of the Sankh and Koel, and from the east and west ranges of the valley of the Ib, divide the cultivable area into small blocks, so that the actual tillage is much less than in other tracts of a similar area. Magnificent forests occupy the valley of the Br\u00e1hmani, Koel, and Sankh rivers. Included within the State are two feudatory chiefships subordinate to the R\u00e1j\u00e1, N\u00e1gr\u00e1 in the east and Hing\u00edr in the west. The chief rivers are the Ib, the Sankh, and the South Koel; the two latter unite in the east of the State, and, after a southerly course, fall into the sea in Cuttack District as the Br\u00e1hmani. Diamonds and gold are occasionally found in the Ib; coal exists in Hing\u00edr, but is not yet worked. The principal jungle products are lac, t\u00e1s\u00e1r silk, resin, and catechu. Tigers, leopards, wolves, bison, etc. abound.\n\n**History.**\u2014G\u00e1ngpur, with Bon\u00e1i and eight neighbouring States now attached to the Central Provinces, was ceded to the British by the treaty of Deog\u00e1on in 1803, but was restored to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur by special agreement in 1806. It reverted to the British under the provisional engagement with Madhuji Bhonsla (Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib) in 1818, and was finally ceded to us in 1826. G\u00e1ngpur yields the R\u00e1j\u00e1 an annual income of \u00a32000; tribute to the British Government, \u00a350.\n\nThe State contained a population (1881) of 107,965, namely, males 56,009, and females 51,956. Hindus numbered 105,880; Muhammadans, 267; Christians, 105; persons professing aboriginal religions, 1713. The bulk of the population are of aboriginal descent, but have gradually adopted Hinduism in some shape as their religion. The Bhuiy\u00e1s and Ur\u00e1ons are the most numerous of the aboriginal tribes. The residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 is at Su\u00e1d\u00ed, on the Ib, the valley of which is very fertile. Chief crops\u2014rice, sugar-cane, oil-seeds, and tobacco. Villages in G\u00e1ngpur are held either on feudal tenures or on farming leases. The feudal tenures date from early times, when the vassals of\nthe chief received grants of land in consideration of rendering military service, and making certain payments in kind. These payments have been commuted for a quit-rent in money; but the attendance of the vassals with rusty matchlocks or bows and arrows is still enforced when the chief moves through his domains.\n\nIn the hamlets, the priests of the aboriginal deities rank next to the g\u00e1onti\u00e1, or head-man; their duties are to decide boundary disputes, to propitiate the gods of the mountains and forest, and to adjudicate on charges of witchcraft. Since the State came under British rule, human sacrifices have been abolished. The police force is purely indigenous. The feudatories, with one exception, form a rural militia.\n\n**Gangrov.**\u2014Town in the Native State of Udaipur (Oodeypore), Rajput\u00e1na. Situated on the Nimach and Nasir\u00e1b\u00e1d (Nusseer\u00e1b\u00e1d) road, 51 miles from the former, and 93 from the latter. It possesses a fine artificial lake, and is commanded by a hill fort belonging to the R\u00e1o of Bedla.\n\n**Ganguri\u00e1.**\u2014Village and head-quarters of a police circle, in Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal. Lat. 23\u00b0 12' 22\" N., long. 88\u00b0 8' 48\" E. Population under 5000.\n\nEND OF VOLUME IV.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File":
