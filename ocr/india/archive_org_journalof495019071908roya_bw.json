Ridley.\n\nAs the work of civilization progresses and the forests fall before the axe of the planter, the more primitive tribes of jungle folk disappear, to be replaced by the imported and more civilized labourer from other countries; and should these old world folk themselves not actually disappear, they amalgamate with the later arrivals, and adopting their ideas and customs, they become so changed that all that is interesting about them is lost. Many tribes of the human race have thus passed away, leaving few or no relics of their ever having existed. One such race, indeed the makers and users of the stone implements known here as Batu Lintar, has vanished from the peninsula; but we have still with us that simple people commonly known as S'akais, whose manners, customs, traditions and language, have been long the study of Messrs. Skeat and Blagden, who together have published a most excellent record of the vanishing tribes of the jungle folk of the Malay Peninsula. The work in two volumes excellently illustrated by photographs and woodcuts is perhaps one of the most important of ethnological works that has appeared for some time. No trouble has been spared by the authors, both well known officials here some years ago, to collect all possible evidence on all ethnological and anthropological questions concerning these races, and the extensive list of the Bibliography of the subject shows how thorough their work has been.\n\nThe Bibliography dates from 1800, or thereabouts, and is divided up into three periods. The first two from 1800 to 1850, and thence to 1890, though giving a good many amateur's notes and some amount of research work, supplied little more than enough knowledge to stimulate research into these interesting\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nraces. The only representations of any of the tribes in those days were the rough sketches of profiles by Miklucho Maclay which were to be found in all ethnological books. Indeed till about 1890 photographs of these races were quite un procurable in Singapore. From 1890 onwards the wild men were the subject of study by a large number of ethnologists and anthropologists. Several scientific men came from Germany, and many local residents investigated the ethnology and collected specimens of their handiwork, made researches into their language, and took photographs of the people themselves, besides securing skulls and skeletons. The results of this work in which Mr. Skeat took a very large share himself, are well represented in these two volumes. One of those who devoted a great deal of time to the wild tribes was Mr. Vaughan Stevens, a very well known character here for some years, who was employed by the Berlin and St. Petersburg Missions to collect ethnographical specimens of the Sakais, and who wandered about all over the peninsula in search of them. He published voluminous accounts of his researches, on some of which considerable doubt has been thrown. The authors have made use of his work while drawing attention to inaccuracies and improbabilities in his observations and theories. The most important of the anthropologists who visited the peninsula was Herr Rudolf Martin whose monumental work \"Die Inland stamme der Malayischin Halbinsel\" was the first sound and reliable work on the subject.\n\nThe book commences with an introductory account of the environment of the wild man, and his character and relations to it.\n\nThe racial characters and names of the tribes and the problems of their origin are next dealt with. The three types of the tribes are the Semangs, negritos with woolly hairs and brachycephalic heads, the Sakais, dolichocephalic with wavy hair, and the southern Jakuns, brachycephalic and smooth haired. The relationship of the Semangs with the Andamanese and the Philippine negritos is certainly close. The Sakais are perhaps related to the Veddahs, Australians and Tamils. They vary much in skin-colour and height, and their origin must\nremain at present doubtful. The Jakuns have been stated to be aboriginal Malays who refused to accept Mohammedanism and therefore fled to the interior to avoid persecution. The author points out however that they are rather a composite group of heathen Malays mixed with Semang and Sakai, and this is probably the case.\n\nThe methods of hunting, trapping and fishing, the weapons, cultivation, food, arts and crafts, social order, dealings with other races fill the first volume, which terminates with an appendix containing much important matter in measurements, color of hair, eyes, and skin and a large collection of Sakai songs chiefly collected by Mr. Skeat. Many of these are hunting songs describing the chase and capture of about all the jungle animals. Most songs end with a request to give each of the community a portion of the prey. This is a true characteristic touch of the socialism of the Sakai community. I remember once being out with some of the wild tribe of the Kuala Lumpur district near the well known caves. In the party were two men and one delightful little boy of about nine years of age clad as most of the men were in the simple costume of a strip of trap bark about as broad as a bootlace, and an armlet of fungus. While at tea we offered the child some bread and jam which he took eagerly and ran off at once to divide it with his father. When given a cigar he would not take it till he had another one for his father, showing the innate socialistic tendency of the race.\n\nBut to return to the songs after this digression. One is struck at first sight by the graphic descriptions of the habits of the animals, their appearance and cries. Some of the songs and charms too have an element of poetic feeling running through them.\n\nIn many cases the language of the Besisi from whom the author has derived most of the songs and charms is a mixture of Malay and Sakai words, the meaning of some of the latter being obscure. Mr. Skeat has translated them as literally and carefully as may be, though perhaps it might have been better not to have called the Kijang, the Roedeer, or if no other translation was to be found, to have explained what the ani-\nmal really was, but its common name of Muntjac is fairly well known. Here and there in the songs and charms we see words and names of places of quite modern origin, such as Tanjong Pagar, Singapore, Telasilh, (the Hindu Tulsi) for the Basil plant known to Malay as Selasih, and this has been commented on by one reviewer as somewhat discrediting the songs, but such innovations in folk song occur in many nations, having drifted in later perhaps than the original song was written.\n\nA long list of names of people is given, many of which are not translated but among them are such poetic ones as Blossom, Convolvulus, Earth, Wind, Star, Butterfly, and Father of Leaf for boys, and White, Quick, Mother of Grass, Little One and Handmaid for girls.\n\nThe second volume opens with accounts of customs and beliefs. The Semangs acknowledge two deities, Kari and Ple but there seems to be no cult of these gods who are rather shadowy beings. The Sakais have a similar deity who however was probably of Malay or Arabic origin. There are however numerous demons and spirits, which are feared and have to be kept off by charms, as in all races of the world. The creation legends seem to be mainly original. In Semang and Jakun mythology man multiplied so fast, being immortal, that the earth was overcrowded, and Kari according to the Semangs slew them with his fiery breath, while according to the Jakuns, Tuan dibawah their deity turned half of them into trees. But this check on the population being insufficient death was instituted as a relief. The Jakuns appear to have anticipated the discovery of evolution in ascribing the origin of mankind to a pair of white apes, which is curious, especially in view of the fact that the ape specified, the wawa (Hylobates) is generally considered the most nearly related to man of any of the apes. The charms, ceremonies, traditional sales, dances, and such subjects are fully dealt with, and the last part of the book deals with the language, the special task of Mr. Blagden, than whom it would be difficult to find a better authority. A vocabulary of the dialects is given at the end.\n\nThe amount of research which this work must have entailed has been extremely large, and the authors have spared\nno pains to get together everything that has been recorded in the various journals and works on the subject of these strange races, besides adding extensively from their own observations. They have collected too a very fine series of photographs of the different races, and added many of the weapons, houses, dress, traps, and other objects, so that the whole work gives a very full and graphic view of one of the most interesting and least known of the peoples of the earth. When one looks back for a comparatively few years ago in ethnological and anthropological works to see what was known about this people, and sees what poor and often inaccurate accounts we then had, and find the only existing portraits of any of the races were Miklucho Maclay's rough sketches, one can appreciate the value of this work, and the immense labour of the authors in compiling it, and they are heartily to be congratulated on the results.\n\nAs they very pertinently point out in the introduction to the work there is great need of a thorough survey of the whole Peninsula from both a geographical and ethnological point of view by the local Governments. The Governments of French Indo-china, the Dutch Indies and the American Philippines have published and are still publishing excellent works, beautifully illustrated, on the ethnology, geography, and all branches of science of the colonies under their control. The British nation with larger, richer and more important colonies, for some reason not very clear to anyone, has practically done nothing at all for the advancement of knowledge of its vast empire. The whole of this work has been left to enthusiastic private persons who devote their time and money to such work. This apathy must be much regretted by all who have the cause of science and progress at heart.\nOn Tally Sticks and Strings in Borneo.\n\nBy Dr. Hose and J. Hewitt.\n\nAmongst the natives of Sarawak, notched sticks and strings are in common use for keeping record of contracts. To some of the various tribes the custom is one of antiquity whilst in other cases e.g. the Sea Dayaks, it is certainly a new idea borrowed from their neighbours.\n\nIf a Malanau undertakes to meet another person in a definite number of days he ties up a piece of string into as many knots as there are days before the fulfilment of his engagement: as each day passes by he unties a knot. The same people often appear in the debt courts carrying a knotted string or rotan and explaining that each knot represents a debt of one pasu of lemanta (8 gallons of raw sago). On one occasion a Malanau produced in the debt court a stick notched on two sides: on the one side the notches corresponded to his debt, and on the other side he had cut a notch each time he had made a repayment.\n\nAmongst the Kenyahs, Punans and other tribes of the interior this custom reaches its highest development. The string is made from bark of the tree known to Kenyahs as Kumut and to Sea Dayaks as Tekalong (*Artocarpus* sp.) As before, it is knotted according to the number of days before that of the engagement, and each party keeps a string. They wear it on their person tied to the unus, slender leglets of twisted fibre usually from the ijok palm (*Arenga saccharifera*). As each day passes by a knot is cut clean off. To such people a definite contract thus arranged is kept quite seriously and the evidence of his tally string is usually deemed quite sufficient to relieve the wearer of other conflicting duties which might be imposed upon him by the head-man of the house.\n\nBut this custom is by no means confined to men. Even Bali Atap, a god of the Kenyahs, wears such knotted strings around his neck to tell off the number of doors in the house.\nunder his care, and also to indicate the number of people under his protection in each house. The image of Bali Atap outside the door of a Madang house has a whole fringe of knotted strings tied round his neck. This deity (Bali\u2014a hero, Atap\u2014a spear) is the special protector of the house, and when they want him to take charge of a house it is necessary to kill at his altar a fowl or pig, the blood of the sacrifice being sprinkled over the head of the wooden image of the god and on those persons of the assembled crowd, who wish for his protection; in some cases however, an egg in a cleft stick has to suffice as the offering. To the Kenyah or Punan the tying of the knot for Bali Atap has a deep significance: it means to them the sealing of a fixed contract. They will only tie such knots when they receive an omen from Bali Atap sufficiently favourable to justify them in assuming that the god is willing to make the agreement with them. The actual manner of obtaining such an omen is as follows: a man fixes up two vertical poles in the ground and on the top of these and again two feet below he attaches horizontal poles; then he sits down behind the square thus formed and looks through it to the area of sky beyond. At this part of the ceremony the above mentioned sacrifice is made. And now, after waiting perhaps for hours, if a hawk soars in this patch of sky in a direction from right to left, he knows that this hawk will carry his message to Bali Atap, and seeing it he waves a fire brand in the air towards the flying bird at the same time loudly shouting the message which is carried upwards in the ascending smoke to the hawk. Thus being assured that Bali Atap has been willing to receive and hence is favourable to his request he completes the ceremony by tying the knotted string to the image of the god as a seal to the agreement just made between Bali Atap and the man.\n\nThe same idea in the tying of a knot is met with in entirely different ceremonies of which we may mention one example. It is held by Kenyahs that when a person falls sick his soul leaves the body and to heal the patient all that is necessary is the return of the soul. The witch doctor (Dayong) in charge of the case obtains assistance from the next world and thus is able to persuade the erring soul to return. In the ceremony\nthe Dayong affects the motions of a person going along journey\u2014paddling a boat for instance\u2014chanting all the time and accompanied in the chorus by the people who repeat over and over again the words 'Bali Dayong;' then returning with the soul he with the assistance of a fowl or pig waives it back into the body. And now, when safely in and the fees paid, the Dayong knots round the patient's wrist with a string of 'Daun silat' (leaf of a Licuala palm) and thus ties in the soul and at the same time completes the undertaking. During this time however the soul of the Dayong has been absent from his body and at this stage to the cries of 'Mulai Mulai' (Come home, come home) from the crowd it re-enters, the man himself suddenly relapsing from a quivering hissing maniac into a rational being who, as if just awakening from a sleep, takes his seat unconcernedly amongst the crowd.\n\nTally sticks also are very much used by Kenyahs, Punans, and other inland tribes (but not Kayans) who have not come in contact with more civilised peoples. An ordinary Kenyah tally stick is a strip of wood about a foot long, an inch or more wide, and an eighth of an inch thick: at one end is a rudely carved head and hands, a representation of the god. At one side of the stick are marks each referring to one door of the house. A debt incurred by the occupant of any 'door' is recorded by a notch in the corresponding position on the stick. Bartering among these people is very limited: their objects of barter are few, being mainly pigs, fowls, parangs, gongs, and pieces of iron. For each of these different objects there are separate positions on the stick. Excepting in rare cases debts are not incurred between occupants of different houses so that one stick of the type just described is as a rule quite sufficient to record all the debts owed to one man. When a debt is paid the owner of the stick will just snip away the wood from either side of the notch so as to replace the notch by a curved depression in the wood.\n\nThe tally stick is usually to be found hung up near the fireplace where it becomes smoked and blackened with age: such a stick would be accepted as evidence in case of a dispute respecting a debt of long standing, for it would not be easy to\nforge an old notch. A stick which has been kept for years acquires quite a high value as a 'lucky' stick: it is customary also in disputes to swear with such sticks calling down vengeance on themselves if they tell a lie. Kenyahs, whose conservatism is not very strong, often content themselves with sticks devoid of carving or polish and even sometime without the image of the god.\n\nIn conclusion therefore it seems to us very probable that in the knotted string (terbuku tali) of the more civilised and better known natives of Borneo and perhaps in the tally stick we have something which did not originate merely as a means of counting but which is a relic that has largely lost its original meaning of covenant.\nNew or Rare Malayan Plants.\n\nSeries III.\n\nBy H. N. Ridley.\n\nThis is another series of novelties and notes on little known plants from the East. The recently published numbers of the Materials for the Flora of the Malay Peninsula by Dr. King contains the Scrophulariaceae, and I find in the genus Torenia one common species altogether omitted and two very distinct plants wrongly identified with two common Siamese plants cultivated here only. I have therefore given descriptions of these three plants. Some new plants obtained in Sarawak by Mr. Hewitt, some from Southern Siam by Mr. Down, and other little known or new plants from elsewhere are described.\n\nNeckia.\n\nThe small genus Neckia comprises a few species of small half shrubby plants belonging to the section Sauvagesiaceae, of Violaceae. They are usually under a foot tall, often only a few inches high, with lanceolate toothed leaves, and small rose or white flowers. The slender woody stem seldom or never branches and is more or less covered with bristly hairs. The fruit is a small capsule containing a large number of very small reticulate seeds.\n\nThe Neckias are to be found on rocks, usually sandstone or granitic, in the forests of the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo.\n\nN. Malayana, n. sp.\n\nWhole plant 3-12 inches tall. Stem naked below (from the falling off of the leaves), woody slender, above covered densely with the bristle-like stipules red brown \u00bc inch long.

Bract linear minute, pedicel \u00bc inch long. Sepals 5 lanceolate acute toothed. Petals 5 rose pink ovate obtuse. Stamens monadelphous 10. Pistil conic, style straight longer than the stamens, capitate. Capsule ovoid acute with the style persistent longer than the sepals, seed obovoid punctate dark brown.\n\nJohor: Gunong Janeng (Lake and Kelsall), Telepak (C. B. Kloss), Gunong Panti (Ridley 4164); Pahang: Tahan river (Ridley 2264), Lingga, edge of a stream at 200-300 feet (Hullett).\n\nThere are two forms of this, one small to 1 foot tall, the leaves broadly lanceolate 2\u00bd inches long by \u00bd inch wide and more strongly toothed. This is the form common in Johor and Lingga. The Pahang plant has leaves 6 inches long and \u00be inch wide, and might be made a variety under the name of angustifolia.\n\n*N. distans*, n. sp.\n\nStem slender woody over a foot tall, internodes \u00bc inch long. Leaves alternate stipules of dark brown branched hairs, persistent shorter than in the preceding.

Flowers solitary axillary, peduncle very short less than \u00bd inch. Bract lanceolate acute minute, pedicel \u00bd an inch long or very much less. Sepals broadly lanceolate acute striate \u215b inch long with a few teeth towards the tip. Petals shorter ovate, lanceolate blunt pink. Stamens shorter than in the preceding.

Stem woody, internodes short; stipules of long erect bristly brown hairs. Leaves crowded towards the tip broadly oblanceolate obtuse, base narrowed acuminate, edges stringly bidenticulate dark above rather coriaceous, pale beneath 4 inches long by 1 inch broad or less. Flowers solitary axillary on peduncles \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long, pedicels shorter. Sepals ovate lanceolate, not or little toothed ribbed, longer than the capsule. Petals very small ovate. Capsule subglobose shorter than the sepals.\n\nBorneo: Sarawak on Matang (Hullett, Ridley).\n\nMiquel, and Boerlage and Koorders (Ic. Bogor lxxvi) identify Hooker's plant collected by Lobb in North Borneo, with Korthals' plant N. serrata which is described as four feet tall and is a native of Sumatra. I never saw any species of Neckia nearly as big as this. The plant figured in the Icones Bogorienses as N. serrata seems to be different again. It can hardly be Hooker's plants, for in his description the leaves are said to be bidenticulate whereas in the plant figured they are almost quite entire, remarkably so for one of the genus. Hooker's plant is probably the one described above, but his description is too short for so critical a genus. It can hardly be either Korthals' plant or Boerlage's.\n\nN. Klossii, n. sp.\n\nStem 4 or 5 inches tall woody leaves crowded upwards. Stipules ferrugineous. Leaves oblanceolate, subacute, narrowed towards the base glabrous dark green above light green beneath edges bidenticulate especially towards the tip \\( 2\\frac{1}{2} \\) inches long \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch wide. Scapes very slender several together or solitary \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long. Bract linear very narrow.

I. 2 p. 118. This is described as four feet tall, a native of Sumatra.\n\nI have never seen anything fitting the descriptions of either of these two species.\n\n**GLUTA.**\n\nThere are a number of trees belonging to the *Anacardiaceae* commonly known to the Malays as Rengas, and all are well\nknown for their poisonous properties. This poison lies in a black resin which is abundant in all parts of the trees, chiefly in the wood and fruit. Several of these Rengas trees belong to the genus *Melanorrhoea* characterised by its small fruit furnished with bright crimson wings, others belong to the genus *Gluta* in which the fruit is a larger or smaller drupe with often a corky brown exterior full of black resin.\n\nThere are about ten known species of *Gluta* occurring in Cambodia, Andamans, Tavoy, the Malay Peninsula and Islands.\n\nNearly all these Rengas trees possess a very fine red timber marked usually with black streaks of the resin and have been known as Singapore mahogany. When used as furniture wood however they are said to exhale a certain quantity of the poison probably in the form of dust which is very injurious to those using the furniture. An article on poisoning by Renghas (*Melanorrhoea*) was published by Dr. Brown in Journal 24, 83, (1892). Cases of poisoning among jungle folk by these plants are by no means rare, a drop of the juice from a broken bough even of a seedling falling on the face or body often producing serious effects. The resin is also said to be used as a poison with criminal intent producing violent irritation of the stomach and intestines.\n\nIt is interesting to note that though the Mangiperas (Mangos) are closely allied to the *Gluta* and contain to a lesser extent the same black resin, their timber is more or less of a yellow colour, while that of the Melanorheas and Glutas is red.\n\nThere are four species of *Gluta* known from the Malay peninsula, one of which however has not been described, and I have received specimens of fruit and flowers of this fine timber tree from Mr. Burn-Murdoch.\n\n*Gluta Benghas*, Miq.\n\nA medium sized tree usually much branched low down. Leaves elliptic or obovate coriaceous with a fairly long petiole, and glabrous panicles of white flowers. The fruit brown, corky outside, with much black resin. This tree has only been met with by my-\nself in the Malay Peninsula on the banks of the Pahang river and on the Rumpin river. It occurs also in Sumatra, Java and Borneo, and a variety is recorded from Madagascar.\n\n*G. elegans*, Kurz.\n\nIs a smaller tree slender and tall, with rather long narrow elliptic leaves rather long petioled, and bright red calyces to the flowers. The fruit is flattened and rounded $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inch across smooth and black. It occurs commonly in Penang, and has been met with in Malacca and a variety occurs in Tenasserim and the Andamans. Native Name \"Rengas Ayam.\"\n\n*G. coarctata*, Hook fil.\n\nThis I take to be the extremely common bush or bushy tree occurring in most tidal waters in this region. It never seems to attain any great size and is conspicuous in the water edge of the river from its bright red young leaves. The flowers are yellowish white in panicles shorter than the leaves. The fruit is subglobose, corky, light brown and very resinous.\n\nThis is the commonest species; very abundant in all our tidal rivers, and also very conspicuous in Sumatra and Sarawak.\n\n*Gl. Wrayi*, King.\n\nI have seen no type of this but I take the description given in the Materials of the Flora of the Malay Peninsula to apply to this plant, of which good specimens were sent to me by Mr. Burn-Murdoch, under the name of Rengas Kerbau Jalang or Red Rengas. It is a very big tree with stiff coriaceous leaves 4 to 6 inches long elliptic acute narrowed at the base to a broad flat petiole, nerves about 12 pairs conspicuous on the lower surface, finely reticulated on both sides. Panicles 4 inches long with rather distant branches to near the base; flowers very numerous red and white\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nPanicle and flowers pubescent. Calyx half as long as the corolla bilobed pubescent lobes rounded. Petals linear oblong obtuse, back pubescent. Stamens slightly longer, filaments slender glabrous. Ovary rounded ovoid pubescent style lateral shorter than the stamens. Fruit oblong red brown, a large hard drupe of a laterite red colour 4 or 5 inches long and 3 inches thick elliptic smooth slightly oblique. Dindings: at Lumat (Ridley 7974); Perak (Wray 2290); Penang: Telok Bahang (Curtis).\n\n\"Rengas Kerbau Jalang\" This gives a very fine timber known as Red Rengas according to Burn-Murdoch. There is a plant in the Botanic gardens raised from seed brought from the Dindings in 1894 which is now about 8 feet tall. The leaves are much larger in the young plant, some being 8 inches long and of a bright green. Compared with Sir George King's description this plant only differs in the leaves not being thickly coriaceous, though rather stiff when dry, and the nerves are quite visible on both surfaces and prominent on the underside, the petiole too is not channelled but distinctly flat, but there is some variation in the foliage.\n\n*Gl. lanceolata*, n. sp.\n\nA big tree. Leaves narrowly lanceolate obtuse narrowed into a long slender petiole, coriaceous blade 6 inches long, 2 inches wide, nerves rather inconspicuous about 12-14 hairs, reticulations conspicuous, petiole 1\u00bd to 3 inches long. Panicles 4 inches long much resembling those of *Gl. Wrayi* pubescent. Calyx half the length of the corolla, tubular split on one side, pubescent. Petals linear oblong obtuse 5 back pubescent tip tufted with hairs, and a band of hairs down the centre of the inner face. Stamens considerable longer than the petals, filaments very slender. Ovary sub-globose quite glabrous, style lateral rather long. Fruit unripe globose glabrous black.\nPenang: Balek Pulau (Ridley 9465).\n\nThis differs from *Wrayi* in the less pubescent spathaceous not bilobed calyx, the pubescence on the inner face of the corolla lobes and the perfectly glabrous ovary. A specimen collected by Curtis in Penang of what seems to be the same plant has elliptic acuminate leaves very much resembling those of *Gl. Wrayi* but the flowers are exactly those of the above described species.\n\n**Compositae.**\n\nIn the 16th part of the Materials for a Flora of the Malay Peninsula Sir George King publishes the account of the Compositae of the peninsula. Most of the plants of this order here are introduced species often of wide distribution, but a considerable number have apparently not been seen by him, although they are thoroughly established in the country. They are *Sparganophorus Vaillantii* Gaertn.\n\nSo common as to be a pest in the gardens. A herb with axillary balls of purple flowers, growing in damp spots. Common in Tanglin and elsewhere. I have also found it in Selangor at Batu Tiga and in Borneo at Lundu in Sarawak district. It is said to be a native of the West Indies.\n\n*Elephantopus tornentosus* L.\n\nThis is a very much taller plant than the common *E. scaber* four or five feet tall and much more woolly. The stems are much branched and the leafy shoots tall and very woolly. It has a very different appearance from the common plant and is said to be a native of North America.\n\nJohor, Roadside Castle wood, Tebrau river (Ridley).\n\n*Conyza semipinnatifida*, Wall.\n\nA very common weed in new clearings and waste ground. A tall branched plant with small heads of yellowish flowers, quite resembling *Erigeron linifolia* in appearance. Clarke says in his description of it in the\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nCompositae Indicae that its flowers are \"intense flava,\" but it is a very dull thing here. I have it from Pulau Ubin, Bukit Mandai (Ridley 3807); Johor: Batu Pahat (Hullett); Pahang: Pulau Jellam, Pahang river, Sungei Ujong, Burunang (Cantley's coll); Selangor: Kwala Lumpur (Curtis); Penang Hill (Ridley 10205); Selangor Caves (Ridley 8235). A big plant 6 feet tall. Malacca: Bukit Asahan (R. 12586), and Perak in Cantley's Collection.\n\nIts Native names are \"Sumbong Jantan\" and \"Sari bulan.\"\n\nA specimen collected by Dr. Keith in Bangtaphan is also in the Botanic Gardens Herbarium.\n\nThese three species were identified at Kew.\n\nXanthium strumarium.\n\nOccurs as a weed in Singapore Town.\n\nCaesulia axillaris, Roxb.\n\nWhat appears to be this plant occurs in Singapore at Galang (7085 of my collection), and at Dato Kramat in Penang (Curtis 3455). It is known as Chinkro and Kangkong Kerbau in Penang and is used as a salad by Malays and as medicine by Chinese.\n\nAcanthospermum xanthioides, Dec.\n\nA prostrate herb with white flowers and spiny fruit, occurs in Singapore on road sides, Macpherson Road (8417, 6241), Ang Mokio (2740), of my collection and was also collected by Hullett on Drew's road in 1884.\n\nBlumea spectabilis, Dec.\n\nA tall weedy plant growing in woods. Selangor: Ginting Bidai (Ridley 72 16); Kwala Lumpur (Curtis 2350); Sungei Ujong (Cantley's Coll.). I have it also from Siam at Bangtaphan collected by Keith and from Christmas Island. It is recorded from India and Ceylon. The plant known as Chapur and Kupugis is boiled and applied in cases of Rheumatism.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nBl. densiflora, Dec.\n\nI take a stout plant like Bl. Balsamifera but not aromatic which grows on the road up the Taiping hills to be this plant. It is abundant on the road side at 4000 feet alt.\n\nVernonia eleagnifolia.\n\nIs also omitted from the Flora. It is a sarmentose shrub with lavender flowers. I met with it in Pahang at Pekan on the riverbank near Ayer Hitam in flower in June (Ridley 1199). Plants brought to the Botanic Gardens grow into bushes but have never flowered since. I have it also from Bangtaphan in Siam collected by Dr. Keith.\n\nCyrtandraceae.\n\nChirita rupestris, Ridl.\n\nSince publishing the account of this plant in the Journal, I have obtained and raised plants of this species from a seedling which came up in a pot in Penang Gardens, and am able to add fuller details to my account of it, which was based on somewhat weak plants collected by Curtis in the Lankawi islands in 1889.\n\nThe plants now raised are more robust, the stems stouter, more or less purplish and sometimes much branched. The leaves are light green as are the urn-shaped involucres of two bracts. The flowers described as dark blue in Curtis field-note are light violet blue with a white tube and yellow throat, \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch long, the limb half an inch across, the corolla lobes are rounded and glabrous in front, but the tube margins of the lobes, and mouth of the tube are covered with white hairs. The two stamens have short thick sinuous filaments, and elliptic anthers. The ovary is cylindric and hairy the style not much longer. The stigma is flat and linear.\n\nCyrtandromaea minor, n. sp.\n\nWhole plant 20 inches tall, stem angled pubescent. Leaves opposite ovate lanceolate obtuse, base acute mar-\ngin crenulate 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch long 1\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch wide, scabrid hairy on both surfaces, petiole \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch long hairy. Flowers in axillary umbels, peduncle \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) inch long hairy. Bracts lanceolate acute white hairy. Flowers 5 in an umbel, pedicels \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) inch long white hairy. Calyx \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch long campanulate pubescent, lobes 5 acute red. Corolla \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch long tubular lobes rounded, pubescent firm texture, white or yellow. Stamens 4 didynamous. Style shorter than the two longer stamens stout, stigma broad subquadrate. Ovary small quadrate truncate surrounded by a sinuate disc.\n\nSarawak: Kuching (Hewitt).\n\nCyrtandra Gimlettii, n. sp.\n\nStem woody brown, 4 inches tall pubescent, especially the young parts. Leaves obovate subacute narrowed gradually to the base serrate, bright green reticulate bullate, main nerves 6 pairs, shining above, with appressed scattered hairs, nerves beneath thickly hairy 6 inches long four inches wide, petiole beneath purple. Flowers in small tufts from the lower leaves or from axils of fallen leaves, 4 or 5 together sessile. Bracts small ovate pale whitish yellow hairy. Calyx short tubular deeply bilobed with two acute points hairy. Corolla tube \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch long thick curved dilated upwards hairy, limb \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch across upper lobes subtriangular obtuse lower three oblong obtuse, glabrous in front, creamy white, lower lip yellower, with deep purple blotching ending in two purple bars on the lower lip. Stamens 2, filaments stout sinuous purple, anthers orange elliptic pressed together. Pollen floury white. Stigma transversely oblong large green. Staminodes 2 very short sinuous filaments, from near the base of the tube.\n\nKelantan: Kwala Lebir (Dr. Gimlette).\n\nThis little plant was sent alive by Dr. Gimlette from Kelantan and flowered in the Botanic Gardens in December 1906. The stamens project first after the flower\nopens, and shed the pollen on the lip. The second day the filaments contract and curl up and the stigma appears at the mouth of the flower.\n\nDidymocarpus (\u00a7 Baeopsis).\n\nI propose this section of Didymocarpus for a number of small species with the short corolla-tube and two short stamens with thick sigmoid filaments and sub-globose or elliptic anthers. The form of the flowers and habit of the plants is exactly like that of Saint-paulia, an African genus, and that genus only differs in the thick conic capsule. It would probably be better to separate the section above mentioned into a distinct genus, Baeopsis, but there are intermediate links with the long tubed I. idymocarpi. The section would include, D. perdita Ridl., D. puncticulata Ridl., D. heterophylla Ridl., and the following new species from the island Pulau Battam, south of Singapore.\n\nD. battamensis, n. sp.\n\nLeaves elliptic obovate 2 to 3 inches long 1\u00bd inch wide, apex and base rounded minutely bullate, deep green more or less softly hairy with a grey green central bar, edges crenate, beneath purple covered with pink hairs, nerves elevated reticulate; petiole \u00bd-2 inches long pink hairy. Scapes numerous slender purple 3 to 4 inches long pubescent one-flowered. Calyx 5 lobed, lobes lanceolate acute purple. Corolla tube short campanulate white \u215b inch long, limb \u00bd inch across very unequal, lobes rounded pubescent outside upper lobes 2 pale violet, lower larger deep violet with three darker nerves on each lobe, tube inside white with a bright orange spot on each side. Stamens 2, anthers elliptic yellowish white large parallel. Filaments broadly linear short and recurved at the tip. Style cylindric purple at the base, tip yellow. Stigma capitate. Capsule an inch long sausage shaped, terminated by the style.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nNEW OR RARE MALAYAN PLANTS.\n\nPulau Battam, an island south of Singapore (C. B. Kloss), Sept. 1905.\n\nThis species is certainly closely allied to *D. perdita* Ridl. but is much more hairy with shorter petioles, and stem and more slender fruit. It is a very pretty little plant but I have failed to cultivate it.\n\n**SCROPHULARINEAE.**\n\n*Torenia mucronulata*, Benth. Dec. Prodr. X. 410.\n\nA prostrate creeping herb a foot or more long, with slender branched hairy stems. Leaves ovate crenate narrowed at the base tip rounded sprinkled with hairs above, the nerves on both surfaces more densely hairy \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch wide and as long, petiole hairy \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch. Flowers axillary solitary or in pairs nearly sessile. Calyx lobes ovate reticulate hairy. Corolla small white with a pale blue bar on each lower petal.\n\nOn paths Singapore, Garden jungle, Bukit Timah (Ridley 6894), Galang; Dindings, Gunong Tungul (Ridley 9444); Pahang: Pahang river Ridley); Penang: Waterfall and Government Hill (Curtis 1837); Trin-ganu, Bundi (Rostado).\n\nNative Names K\u2019ra Nasi; Gelumak Susu, Rumput Labang.\n\nThe powdered leaves are applied in cases of snake bite or rheumatism.\n\nHooker in Flora Brit. Ind. seems to think this but little distinct from *T. polygonoides* but in life at least it is extremely different in its hairiness, and quite differently coloured flowers. It always dries black which *T. polygonoides* does not.\n\n*Torenia caelestis*, n. sp. A slender creeping plant, the stem and leaves pubescent hairy. Leaves ovate dentate subacute base broad 1 inch long petiole \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long. Flowers solitary terminal on slender peduncles 1\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long. Calyx bilobed not winged hairy \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long, lobes\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nlanceolate subacute, ribbed in fruit. Corolla \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch long, Lobes oblong rounded, light blue.\n\nJohore: Kota Tiaggi and along the road to Gunong Pantai (Ridley 4169).\n\nThis plant was identified in the Materials for the Flora of the Malay Peninsula as the very different *T. Benthamiana*, a Cochin Chinese plant commonly cultivated under the name of *T. Bailloni*. This plant has large yellow flowers with a brown centre, while *T. caelestis* has much smaller flowers of a light blue.\n\n*Torenia atropurpurea*, n. sp.\n\nStems creeping and rooting slender 2 feet long or more, branched internodes 1 to 4 inches long. Leaves ovate to deltoid glabrous minutely pustular above, apex acute base broad or slightly cuneate margin crenate serrate, 1-2 inches long \\( \\frac{1}{2}-1 \\) inch wide, petiole slender \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long. Flowers solitary in the upper axils on slender 1 inch peduncles. Bracts very small linear. Calyx \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) inch long narrow tubular, lobes linear acute free for \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of the length of calyx. Corolla deep violet purple an inch long tube narrow tubiform mouth \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch across lobes rounded. Capsule oblong \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long obtuse shorter than the calyx. Seeds subquadrate.\n\nPerak: Maxwell\u2019s Hill (Ridley 5507), Bujong Malacca (at the first Waterfall Ridley 9756) without locality (Scortechini 2122); Selangor: 15th mile, Pahang track (Ridley 8533). On claybanks often growing in great clumps.\n\nThis charming plant has somehow been mistaken in the Flora of British India for *T. asiatica*, a native of Siam commonly cultivated in the East and occasionally appearing is an escape from cultivation. It differs from this species in being a creeping perennial, instead of an erect annual, in its narrow linear calyx lobes and long narrow-tubed deep purple corolla. It is a very pretty\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nplant well worthy of cultivation but I have failed to succeed in establishing it.\n\n*Microcarp\u00e6a muscosa*, R. Br.\n\nA small herb forming large tufts of a bright green colour under water in shallow spots. Stems one to 4 inches tall succulent glabrous, leaves \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\) to long opposite oblong blunt. Flowers axillary solitary sessile very small. Calyx tubular five toothed, teeth acute erect, at length spreading pubescent. Corolla tube cylindric shorter pale, limb hardly projecting beyond the calyx, violet 5-lobed, four short acute, one longer linear oblong all fringed with white hairs. Stamens fertile 2 included, anthers 1-celled yellow, no staminodes. Style shorter than the calyx with a curved lateral stigma. Capsule much shorter than the calyx tube oblong ovoid dehiscing into two valves. Seeds oblong elliptic ocreous rugose.\n\nSingapore: on the edge and shallow water of the Reservoir. September 1906.\n\nThis curious little plant has not previously been recorded from the Malay peninsula, but is known from India, Java and Australia, Griffith, (Notulae Asiatic\u00e6 IV. 101. Ic. Pl. As. t. 417. f. 2). describes a species as *M. diandra* from Bengal which Hooker in the Flora of British India is doubtful about because Griffith says that the calyx is 5-fid, Griffith's rough sketch of the structure of the flower is however very good as far as it goes, showing the curious corolla lobes, one of which is linear oblong and much longer than the others which are small and nearly equal, a point overlooked in all descriptions of the plant, and further he shows the curious processes which terminate and fringe the lobes of the corolla, nor is he altogether wrong about the calyx being deeply cleft. The sepals are indeed connate to near the tip where the five lobes are free and in fruit spread out starwise, but they are so slightly\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nconnate that they very readily separate with but little force used, and in one flower I found them quite free. In fruit they seem to be more firmly attached. The corolla in this plant is very much reduced, and the limb really almost rudimentary, suggesting that its usually submerged life has caused the limb so conspicuous in the *Limnophilas* to be useless and reduced to a rudiment still retaining however traces of the violet coloring (especially conspicuous in the bud) so characteristic of the *Limnophilas*. The little plant forms bright green masses in shallow water, and when submerged is usually very short little over an inch tall; here owing to the drying up of the water edge it is quite free of the water it becomes taller and is three or four inches tall.\n\n**BIGNONIACEAE.**\n\n*Tecoma Curtisii*, n. sp.\n\nA slender climber with wiry stems, internodes 8 inches long. Leaves opposite 4 inches, petiole 1 inch, leaflets 5 lanceolate acuminate base rounded entire glabrous light green shining $1\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long by $\\frac{5}{8}$ inch wide, petiolule $\\frac{1}{8}$ inch long.

Stamens 4 included, anthers white bases divergent, apex terminated by a violet subulate process. Style longer. Stigma lanceolate flat white.\n\nFruit unknown.\n\nPenang: Batu Feringhi (Curtis);\n\nThis has long been cultivated in the Botanic Gardens at Singapore, but it has never set fruit and I have never\nseen fruit on wild plants. It seems to be local in Penang, growing over trees to no great height at Batu Feringhi. It flowers nearly all the year round. Mr. Sprague of Kew proposes to call this *Nyctocalos Curtisii* as the plant is hardly a typical *Tecoma*. It is however so utterly different from any other species of this genus, that it will perhaps be preferable to retain it in the genus *Tecoma* till we can obtain fruit of it.\n\n**Orchideae.**\n\n*Microstylis aurata*, n. sp.\n\nStem an inch long hardly bulbous.

No. 49, 1907.\nThis plant I took at first for Reichenbach's *Plocoglottis Lowii* (Xenia Orchidacea Vol. II p. 142. pl. 154). But even allowing for very rough drawing this can hardly be intended for the common Sarawak species. The flowers of this exactly resemble those of *P. moluccana* Bl. but that is figured and described as belonging to the group of many leaved *Plocoglottis*. No one seems to have seen *Plocoglottis Lowii* since it was first introduced. It is described as having yellow and brown flowers as large as those of *cattleya luteola*. By some extraordinary error Hallier has identified it with a plant which from his figure and description I take to be *Pl. porphyrophylla* Ridl. and J. J. Smith has followed this determination in his orchids of Amboina. No two species of the genus are more utterly dissimilar. *Pl. porphyrophylla* with its dull purplish flowers half an inch across, and most peculiar lower sepals cannot possibly be the plant Reichenbach intended, with flowers 2 inches across, bright yellow with the lower sepals quite resembling the upper one.\n\nThe following are the species of the genus known.

Tab. 27.\n\nThis plant was described from a specimen, obtained in Amherst, Tenasserim by Parish. The specimen, in Herb. Kew seems to be very ill-preserved, and it is suggested that it is an abnormal form, of some other species. Mr. Micholitz has recovered what appears to be the identical species in Tonkin. It was he says abundant and I have three good specimens. In habit\nfoliage and perianth it is absolutely identical with Reichenbach's figure except that it has a short distinct conical spur to the lip, pendant, about half the length of the petal. The column however differs. From the side of the anther projects a triangular flap, about half its length at the base, behind this is a papillose stigma. The rostellar lobes are broad inflexed fleshy truncate as long as the anther processes. The pollinia are more pyriform with long narrow pedicels widest at the apex and narrowing to a terete-portion ending in a small rounded disc. The flowers are white. The plant was obtained from Tonkin.\n\nThe species seems to be a good and distinct one, and I see nothing to suggest it is a monstrosity. The spur varies very much in length in the various flowers, and in some I cannot see any. In others very short not a quarter of the length of the petal. The minute ciliation of the lip and petals by Reichenbach is really a very minute denticulation.\n\n*H. geniculata*, Don. this fine white *Habenaria* was also brought by Mr. Micholitz from the same locality.\n\n**Habenaria borneensis**, n. sp.\n\nWhole plant 6 inches to a foot tall, tubers subcylindric.

Ridley).\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nThis very curious little plant is the first species of the genus recorded from Borneo, the other two species being natives of Nepal and Kedah. This little plant is remarkable for possessing a very narrow spathe and a long slender appendage with no trace of flowers on it, and only a few irregular male flowers on the base. In the other species the male flowers occur to the top or nearly to the top of the spadix and the appendage is very short. The slender white spadices are usually deflexed and lie on the ground, looking like white roots.\n\n*Alocasia Villeneuvei.*\n\nThis aroid is very common in Sarawak especially on the hills of Matang and elsewhere, and the plants often attain a large size. The flowers of it have never been described. I was fortunate in finding it well in flower in August 1905. The peduncle of the inflorescence is 6 inches or more tall but deeply sunk in the petiole sheaths, it is pale green in colour. The spathe is pure white, the swollen part of the base 1\u00bd inch long and nearly an inch in diameter. The ovate lanceolate acute and cuspidate limb is 2\u00bd inches long and 1\u00bd inch wide white. The spadix is sessile 4 inches long. The pistils subglobose with the stigmas on a short thick distinct style. They are round, oblong or ovate and wide white. There are no abortive flowers mixed with them as is often the case in other species. Above them are some abortive female flowers. The male portion appears above the tube, it is only half an inch long the flowers close packed crenulate. The appendix is cylindric and obtuse reticulate, cream colored. The fruiting spadices are white. The spadices shortly after opening were found to be swarming with dipterous larvae. In large plants the inflorescences are numerous.\n\n*Alocasia Beccarii,* Engler.\n\nIs an anomalous species in many ways, in its creeping rhizome and entire leaves. I found it as before on Serapi, the top of Mt. Matang. It was in\nfruit, and I observed that instead of the tubular portion of the spathe, covering the fruit, disrupting irregularly as is usual in Alocasias, the top of it came off whole in the shape of a small conical cap, exposing the orange red fruit standing in a regular cap. In *A. demudata* the spathe base disrupts irregularly.\n\n*Homalomena Lindeni*, *Alocasia Lindeni*, Ill. Hort. 1886 p. 111, Pl. DCLII.\n\nThis plant was originally described (l.c.) under the name of *Alocasia Lindeni* having been introduced from \"Papouasia\" by Linden, who suggests that it may be a Homalomena.\n\nA plant obtained from Rangoon this year flowered in the Botanic Gardens Singapore, and proved to be a species of *Homalomena*. The leaves are ovate cordate 6 inches long and as wide, deep green with yellow veins, petiole 11 inches long sheathing for 3 inches, white. The plant when cut or broken exhales a strong scent of aniseed.\n\nThe spathes are produced several together each on a greenish white peduncle 3-4 inches long, \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch thick. Spathe cylindrical \\( 2\\frac{1}{2} \\) inches long tightly fitting the spadix, pale green darker towards the tip where it ends in a mucro \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long. The spadix barely longer sessile. Female portion 1 inch long, rachis thick and white, pistils very numerous, cylindric rounded, green, stigma round flat capitate, broader than the ovary, white, no abortive flowers.

Spadix little shorter than the spathe. Female portion an inch long. Pistils numerous globose, no abortive flowers visible. Spadix sessile.\n\nSarawak: Lundu (Ridley Sept. 1905).\n\nThe very close nervation of the leaves, which are also thickly dotted with dark colored dots, and the large constricted spadix distinguish this from allied species.\n\n*Homalomena Griffithii* var. *falcata*.\n\nStem stout 2-3 inches long.

Douglas.\n\nI propose to give a short account of a journey I recently made to visit the Kalabits, a people who had only quite recently acknowledged allegiance to the Sarawak Government, and are quite one of the most uncivilized in Borneo.\n\nThe Kalabits, who are scientifically I believe of the Indonesian race, are an agricultural people inhabiting the large tableland in the centre of Borneo from which spring the Baram, Tutau, Limbang, Trusan and Padas Rivers on the West Coast and the Bahau River on the East Coast. They are very industrious and are one of the few tribes who farm by irrigation, and are therefore able to obtain two crops of paddy in the year. They are practically the same race of people as are known as Muruts in the Trusan and Padas Districts.\n\nIn build they are above the average height of Bornean natives and are well made. They are tremendous walkers (a fact which is impressed on one by the size of their feet) and it is said by Kayans that they are capable of walking in one day what other people would take two days to accomplish. This I can quite believe, as all getting about having to take place on foot they are naturally very adept and hardy at this method of progress. They have however absolutely no idea of paddling or using a boat, and when they were first brought down to the Government station at Claudetown, and saw the Baram River, they sat down in the bottom of the Kayan canoes and burst out crying, having never seen such an enormous volume of water before.\n\nAs a lot of these people had just moved into the head of the Tutau River I determined to proceed by this route, although it meant crossing the Mulu Range of hills.\n\nOn the third day of my departure from the Government Station at Claudetown I picked up Dyau Blawing, the Kenyah\nchief who was going to escort me on my journey. After leaving his house, we proceeded up the Tutau River till we reached the Tepin River.\n\nHere the river becomes impracticable for boats on account of rapids, so the next day we started climbing up the hills, which flank the river. We were met by a party of Punans, the wild people who live in the jungle, who had been called by Dyau Blawing to show us the route over the hills. The going was very bad and fatiguing, as we had to clamber up and down the spurs of Mt. Mulu until mid-day, when we reached the foot of a hill called Bukit Sigerun Sigop, called so by the Punans on account of the wild tobacco growing there (Sigop being the Punan name for tobacco). We did not reach the summit of this hill till 5 o\u2019clock in the evening when we must have been at least 5,000 feet up. I decided to encamp here for the night, as we were all very tired and hungry. Cooking was managed with difficulty as there was no water to be found near the summit. It was lucky for us we had the Punans with us, as they soon produced some liquid, which they had found in a pig\u2019s bathing place and which therefore did not look very appetising; still beggars cannot be choosers, so we had to make the best of it. It was bitterly cold all the night.\n\nThe next morning we started on the descent, and when the mists had cleared away the view was perfectly magnificent. At our feet in what seemed a crack in the hills, flowed the Tutau River whilst all round hills towered up to some thousands of feet. At midday we got through the range of hills and from a spur had a still more beautiful view. Right in front of us was the Kalabit country laid out like a map, and as this tableland is comparatively flat, we could see for miles and miles. Away to our right to the South, were the hills in which rise the Pata and Akar rivers, tributaries of the Baram. In front of us rose up Mts. Pamabo and Murud, which separate the head waters of the Baram River from the Trusan; whilst on our left were the ranges which separate the Tutau and Limbang waters.\n\nIn the afternoon we reached the Tutau River again at Long Taoh and the next day continued our journey in some canoes.\nwe found there. We then branched off up a tributary called the Magoh and on the second day from leaving Long Taoh reached the first Kalabit villages at the mouth of a small stream called the Seridan. On our arrival we were saluted with salvoes of firing from muskets and bedils and tremendous cheering, to which we retaliated to the best of our ability. The chief Ili Bawang received us at the landing place and a sort of triumphal procession was made up to the house, where my escort were regaled with 'borak' (rice beer) and smokes, to refresh them after the fatigues of the journey.\n\nThe people of this village, who numbered some two hundred souls, had quite recently moved here from near the headwaters of the Trusan, and their chief, Ili Bawang, had evidently taken a lesson from the dimensions of the long Kayan houses in the Baram River as he had constructed a splendid house on a scale hitherto unattempted by Kalabits, whose dwellings are generally veritable hovels.\n\nI append a sketch of the ground plan of the house.\n\nA wall divided the house in two lengthwise; the front half was a wide verandah of about 20 feet whilst the back part was divided up into rooms, each family having a separate room. The dividing wall however did not extend to the back wall of the house, as they do in Kayan and Dyak houses, thus...\nleaving a passage, by which communication could be kept up from one end of the house to the other, without it being necessary to come out into the common verandah. This passage I found was used by the women, who did not appear in the verandah except on special occasions. In the centre of the middle wall was erected an enormous fireplace and on either side of this was a sort of kennel, in which the married couples slept. These were not walled in on the side next the fireplace, so as to get all the warmth possible, but of course as there was no chimney, they also got their full amount of smoke, and soot. The cold at night quite warranted these people desiring a close proximity to the fire, and I found also that a plunge into the river in the morning seemed as icy and as exhilarating as a cold bath in England.\n\nThe next day all the Kalabits collected from the villages round to the number of five or six hundred, and a grand feast was held; a buffalo and nine pigs were killed. I must admit that although the feast was a fearful orgy, still I could not help admiring the thoroughness with which these people enjoyed the meal. They began to eat at about noon and did not stop doing so until the evening and then only because there was nothing more to eat. All that was left of that buffalo were its horns and leg bones, which even Kalabit indigestion seemed to shy at. The skin I found was being eaten with the hair still on and evidently relished. Of the pigs nothing was left at all.\n\nThe meal being finished, some twenty jars of 'borak' were produced and a drinking bout was started, which lasted till day-light. Whilst this was going on, all the women, attiring themselves in their best clothes and ranging themselves in a long line one behind the other, clasping the shoulders of the one in front, began to march round the house, up the verandah and down the passage at the back and then out into the verandah again. The leader of this procession suddenly burst forth into song, whilst the others joined in the chorus, keeping time with their feet. Although their voices were rather raucous, still the song had a weird plaintive air, which was decidedly fascinating, and to which the smoky torches and wild faces made an impressive 'mise-en-sc\u00e8ne'. The song was\na historical recitation of the brave deeds done by their forefathers in the days of yore down to the present time, when they first came into touch with Europeans and the Government. The rhythm gradually got faster and faster until the march became a quick-step and then a double, whilst the soloist kept time by beating the floor with a stick. Presently the men got carried away with enthusiasm and joined on to the line behind, until there must have been a procession of over a hundred performers careering round the house, shouting the choruses at the top of their voices, but all keeping tune and time. The song then suddenly ceased, and the men returned to their drinking and the women to their duties in the rooms.\n\nThe next morning I went and visited the villages near by, but was not much impressed by their appearance as the houses seemed horrid dirty hovels. At one of these villages I saw the people having a rat hunt. All the men, women and children armed with sticks were engaged in turning over the heaps of rubbish and filth accumulated under the house in search of the wily rodent, which is considered a great delicacy by the Kalabits. Whenever a rat was seen, there was a tremendous 'view halloa' and the whole crowd flung themselves violently into the chase, frequently whacking one another in their attempts to slay their prey. They also lay very ingenious traps, made of bamboo and rattan, all over their houses to catch them.\n\nI was very much struck with the industry of the women; they never seem to stop working and never shield themselves from the sun by means of sun-hats or head handkerchiefs. They wear a short skirt reaching to the knee just like the Dyak women. They are great smokers and are continually using a sort of brass cigarette holder, into which they stuff a little tobacco and puff away for a few minutes.\n\nThese people store their paddy in one large hut, which is raised off the ground some six feet, to prevent rats and other pests climbing up. Inside, this hut is divided into separate rooms for the different owners.\n\nThat night another meeting was held and all the different chiefs proclaimed their loyalty to the Sarawak Government.\n\nR.A., Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nDyau Blawing then toasted the Kalabit chief Ili Bawang to the rousing tune of the Kayan drinking song which with its rolling chorus was much appreciated by the Kalabits. Opportunity is taken during these extempore songs to tell the individual who is toasted the customs of civilized Government and to make certain trite remarks as to his former life and conduct, which he must now reform.\n\nAfter this was over they settled themselves down to drinking, in which occupation every night was spent during our visit there. I noticed that when a drink was offered to any man, all the people near by caught hold of the arm of the giver, those further off catching hold of the arms of those nearer, thus making the drink appear to come from all of them and so the harder to refuse. If a chief was being offered one it often happened that some thirty or forty persons would collect round him to assist in forcing the liquor down his throat.\n\nThe Kalabits were the most generous of hosts, and whilst we stayed with them we wanted for nothing in the way of food, and every day presents of fowls, eggs, sugarcane and sweet potatoes were brought to us. They seemed genuinely pleased to see us and compared favourably their life under the Government to their former one further in the interior, with its constant alarms of war and rumours of war.\n\nOn the fourth day I received their poll tax, and, as dollars or coins of any sort were unknown in these regions, it had to be paid in rubber; every married man therefore paid in three katties of rubber.\n\nThe next day we started on our return journey. We were escorted down to the landing place by the whole population, and amidst the banging of guns and repeated expressions of 'au revoir' and wishes for a safe journey, and the usual accompaniment of cheering, we started down-river.\n\nOur return was very different from the journey up; there was no hard poling and pulling up rapids, for with our experienced boatmen, these were shot with ease in quick succession.\n\nAt midday we reached the mouth of the Magoh River and here I had arranged for a meeting of all the Punan tribes who range through the dense jungle round here. We found about\nfifty of these strange wild people awaiting our arrival. They live entirely on the produce of the jungle. Wild sago and fruit constitute the greater part of their food. When they find a clump of wild sago they encamp there until it is finished and then move on in search of more. They work the sago in the usual way by felling the trunk and then splitting it in two, then the pith is scooped out with a piece of bamboo tied on to the end of a stick. The end of the bamboo is scraped until it presents a sharp edge which easily works through the soft pith.\n\nTheir chief weapon of offence and defence is the deadly blowpipe, from which they shoot out poisoned darts. With these they kill pig and deer, and even rhinoceros have been known to die from the effects.\n\nWe spent the night at Long Taoh, as Dyau Blawing had decided to attempt to shoot the rapids below here, the water being just the right height to enable us to do so; as if the water is too high the waves are so big that a canoe could not stand them; whilst if the water is too low the sharp edged rocks show up, making it too dangerous to proceed.\n\nThis was a great piece of luck, as it saved us making the ascent of Bukit Sigerun Sigop again, and thereby we gained a day, to say nothing of escaping the trouble and labour of the climb. Besides this we had the exciting experience of shooting the dangerous rapids through the gorge, about which I had heard so much; and was glad of having the chance of seeing them.\n\nWe started early the next morning and soon got to the mouth of the gorge, where two spurs of the mountains, one from each side, run down to the river and form a narrow gateaway about twenty yards broad. As the river above this place is about a hundred yards in width, it can be imagined the pace at which the water pours through this narrow neck. We held on to the rocks here whilst the appearance of the water below was examined. It was a wonderful sight looking down the gorge. The river ran pretty straight at first and one could see for about a mile the water pouring down between cliffs, which rose perpendicular to the height of two or three hundred\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nfeet. The man in the bow of the canoe, apparently being satisfied with the state of the water, pronounced that the passage was possible and with a final injunction to sit still and hold tight, we let go and started off. Then ensued one of the most exciting times I have ever experienced. For five hours we simply flew down between those cliffs, without a single stroke of the paddle to assist us, except a quick touch every now and then from the men in the bows and stern to keep the boat straight or to avoid a rock or whirlpool. It was breathless work and nobody seemed inclined to speak, but all attention seemed to be strained as to what was going to appear round this corner or that rock. On we dashed between those grim cliffs on which there was absolutely no foothold to be gained if the boat happened to upset. It gave one the idea of what one would imagine the river Lethe (Long Balek Mati, the River of Death, as the Kayans call it) to be like; although the sun was shining brightly above us still it was chilly and dull down in the gorge between the grey limestone cliffs, whilst the mountains towered thousands of feet above us, and absolute silence reigned, except for the hiss of the rushing waters; and no sign of life was visible.\n\nJust before noon a small cleft in the cliffs on the left bank appeared, where the Maap stream tumbles down a valley between the hills and manages to burst its way through the rocks. This being the first place when it was possible to obtain a foothold, we got out and ate a hurried lunch, the water and weather being closely watched, as a heavy shower of rain would have caused the river to rise several feet and we should have been caught in a trap, unable to proceed up or down-river. Happily luck was still with us, and having finished our meal, we continued our career downstream. After about an hour we heard the roar of waves, which warned us that we were approaching a large rapid, and we quickly pulled into the bank, where, luckily, the cliffs were broken down, and, the pilot having pronounced that it was impossible to shoot this rapid, we carried all our luggage and hauled our canoes over the rocks to a place below the rapid. This proved very hard work as some of the rocks were thirty to forty\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nfeet high, and in one place where there was no way between the rocks, we had to pull the boats up the perpendicular face and let them down again the other side, dangling on to the ends of rattans. This process was repeated four times before we got through the gorge and reached our old encampment at Long Tepin, so it can be understood that we were very hungry and tired.\n\nEach one of us, I think, heaved a sigh of relief when we got through the gorge and had left those grim grey cliffs behind; and for myself I am sure that, although the journey was a unique and exciting experience, still I have no immediate wish to repeat it. The grimness and solitude to which I have already referred were too awe-inspiring to make it exactly enjoyable. How it affected my followers was shown by the fact that, although the Kenyahs are inveterate smokers and are never without a cigarette between their lips, not one of them had touched tobacco the whole of that day.\n\nWhat also struck me was the terrific pace at which the water ran through the gorge, and although I have been up rapids in the Baram River and up all its larger tributaries, still I have never seen the pace equalled. It is accounted for by the fact that the greater portion of the gorge is never more than about 40 yards broad, and the cliffs on either side are worn so smooth that there is absolutely no resistance against this large volume of water. The natives aptly resemble it to \"pouring water through a bamboo.\" When we had reached Long Taoh, we were much troubled with the rubber which I had received as tax from the Kalabits, as it loaded the canoes down too much to enable them to go safely through the gorge. Dyau Blawing persuaded me to allow them to despatch it in the way they sent their rubber through, when they had been trading with the Punans. I reluctantly agreed, and it was immediately strung piece by piece on to a long rattan until it made a huge rope about 50 yards long; it was then wound up in a gigantic ball about 9 feet in diameter, just like one winds up a ball of worsted. Just before we started this ball of rubber was pushed into mid-stream; Dyau Blawing promising that I should find it on the morrow ashore on a gravel bank near the Iman River.\n\nB. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nOn our passage through the gorge nothing had been seen of the rubber, so my anxiety was great. But on the morning after leaving Long Tepin, we reached Long Iman, and there, sure enough, on the gravel bank was the ball of rubber which proved to be none the worse for its rapid voyage. I was assured that this had been done hundreds of times with rubber and it always fetched up at Long Iman, even if it was occasionally detained by rocks or whirlpools. Once a ball of rubber stuck in the gorge for 6 months and its owners gave it up for lost; but it eventually turned up rather battered and broken at Long Iman.\n\nFrom here homewards there was nothing of interest in my journey, and after leaving Dyau Blawing and his escort at their village, I proceeded on and reached Claudetown after an absence of seventeen days, the return journey having only taken four days.\n\nR.

Boden Kloss, F.Z.S.\n\nWhilst residing at Johore Bahru in 1905 a specimen of the rare Leathery Turtle (Dermochelys coriacea, L.) was brought to me by Malay fishermen who had found the reptile entangled in their fishing stakes at Kampung Batu Jawa in the Johore Strait on March 11th of that year.\n\nAccording to their account of its capture, for several days previously, the screens and nets of their kelong had been broken and torn by some unknown agency that at length, at day-break of that morning, proved to be an immense turtle of a kind unknown to them which had entangled itself beyond escape in the material of the damaged fish-trap. For a time they were at a loss to know how to dispose of their unwieldy capture, but finally brought out a large lighter which, filling with water, they sank beneath the turtle; then by baling out the water, the latter was soon reposing on the bottom of the dry boat, where unfortunately it shortly expired and was left exposed to the heat of the sun's rays until it reached me at three o'clock in the afternoon.\n\nGetting it ashore was an operation of some difficulty for it was impossible to grip the creature in any way, and it was not until I had collected a gang of ten Chinese coolies furnished with poles and ropes that it was finally lifted from the boat and up the steps of the sea-wall.\n\nThe weight of this turtle\u2014a male\u2014I estimated as between nine hundred and one thousand pounds and the principal measurements taken were as follows.\n\nTotal length in straight line from tip of head to tip of tail ... ... ... 234 cms. (7 ft. 8 in.)\nExtreme breadth of carapace ... ... 84 ,, (2 ft. 9 in.)\n\" between tips of extended flippers ... ... ... 240 ,, (7 ft. 10 in.)\n\nJour. Straits Branch B. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nIn colour the upper surface was black, mottled with pinky white, while the lower parts were principally yellowish, scantily blotched with dark brown.\n\nThe carapace and plastron presented a mosaic-like appearance; the remaining parts were covered with smooth skin, that of the head being entirely free from shields of any nature as is sometimes reported.\n\nThe contents of the stomach consisted mainly of small fishes, prawns and other crustaceans, mixed with a lesser amount of different vegetable substances.\n\nSo little is this turtle known locally that it was some time before I could obtain a name for it, but at length the word \"kambau\" was given me with the additional information that the term also applied to anything slow or sleepy, such as a prau in a calm, or light head-wind.\n\nVarious circumstances, besides its already somewhat putrid state, prevented me from preserving this valuable specimen in its entirety, but early on the following morning I obtained a number of prisoners from the gaol and with their help got out the skeleton. The flesh, though said to be of a rank and unpleasant flavour, was eagerly begged for by numerous Chinese as soon as stripped from the carcase. The novel appearance and huge size of the reptile were causes of much attraction, and all the afternoon during which it was lying on the sea-front, it was a centre for crowds of interested people.\n\nThough the species is widely distributed through tropical seas (and is occasionally noted outside such areas) I know of only one other example captured in our locality, and this\u2014a much smaller specimen\u2014was forwarded to the Raffles Museum, where it is now exhibited, by Mr. A. M. Skinner who obtained it at Tanjong Katong, Singapore, in 1884. The Johore specimen may therefore take rank as the second recorded capture in this part of the Malayan seas.\n\nA full account of the anatomy of the Leathery Turtle, based on the investigation of a small Japanese specimen, appeared in a recent number of the P. Z. S. (1905, Vol. I Pt. II) but my photographs of this locally-obtained individual\nare reproduced here as hitherto illustrations of this species have given in general a far from accurate representation of its appearance.\nMalayan Pigs.\n\nA Recent Zoological Paper.\nG. S. Miller's \"Notes on Malayan Pigs.\"\n\nBy C. Boden Kloss, F. Z. S.\n\nOne of the most recent of publications dealing with the fauna of the Oriental region is a most interesting and valuable paper by Mr. Gerrit S. Miller, which throws a fresh light on the varieties and distribution of the pigs of the Malayan area.\n\n\"Notes on Malayan Pigs\" * is based on a quite unique collection of 62 specimens from the Malayan Peninsula and Islands, presented to the U. S. National Museum by Dr. W. L. Abbott, and a small contribution of 4 specimens obtained in Johore by myself. In addition to having all this material to work upon Mr. Miller has also examined the types and collections in the Natural History Museums at Berne, Berlin, Leyden and London.\n\nExcluding the Javan species (as not being yet represented in the U. S. N. M. collection) the pigs of Western Malaya are broadly defined as belonging to one or the other of three groups typified as the Barbus group, the Cristatus group and the Vittatus group.\n\nIn the first group, the \"bearded pigs,\" of greatest local interest perhaps is Sus o, Miller, the species which occurs in the Sumatran area, and is, so far, known from the swampy plains of south-eastern Sumatra, from Banka and from the Rhio Archipelago, where, inhabiting Pulo Battam, it most closely approaches the Straits Settlements.\n\nThe other members are Sus barbatus, M\u00fcller, of Borneo, with which Mr. Miller finds Sus longirostris, Nehring, to be\n\n* Proceedings of The United States National Museum, Vol. XXX pages 737-758, with Plates XXXIX\u2014LXIV.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nsynonymous, and a new species, *Sus gargantua*, founded by Mr. Miller on the skull of a young adult male from south-eastern Borneo. This, besides being the largest of known living pigs (upper length of skull of young adult 570 mm., of old *S. barbatus* 510 mm.), is further distinguished by having its extremely low occipital region produced backwards to a degree quite unknown in others of the group.\n\nThe members of the Cristatus group are confined to the mainland and the near-by islands. It has long been thought that the wild pig of the Peninsula was the same as the *Sus cristatus*, Wagner, of India proper and when writing a note on the Sumatran *Sus oi* for the Journal (No. 45, p. 60), I stated that \"only one species of wild pig is at present known to occur in the Malay Peninsula and that is the animal regarded as identical with *Sus cristatus* of India,\" but it appears that the animal ranging from Tower Tenasserim southwards must now be separated from the Indian form. It is now described under the name of *Sus jubatus*; and to a form from Pulo Teratau, and perhaps other islands off the west coast of the Peninsula, that is like *jubatus* but not as large, Mr. Miller has given the name *jubatus*. It is unfortunate however that in making into a separate species an animal that inhabits a shoal-water island situated close to the mainland, the author has only one example to work upon.\n\nThe pigs of the Vittatus group are purely insular except one new species from the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula. They range from the Andamans and Nicobars in the west to the Natunas in the east. The typical *Sus vittatus*, M\u00fcller and Schlegel, inhabits the mainland of Sumatra and the Rhio Archipelago form now becomes a separate species under the name of *rhionis*. The largest known member of the group, which is specially interesting as inhabiting the Asiatic mainland (so that the Peninsula is now found to possess at least two peculiar pigs), occurs in Johore. This is *Sus peninsularis* and presumably the pig of Singapore Island is of this species also.\n\nThe remaining species of this group are widely distributed. On Pulo Nias, on Pulo Babi together with Pulo Tuanku and lastly on Pulo Simalu, all islands of the West Sumatra chain,\nare found respectively *Sus niadensis*, *Sus babi* and *Sus mimus* all described for the first time. The animal that occurs in the islands of the Natunas between the Peninsula and Borneo is *Sus natunensis*, Miller, while *Sus nicoboricus*, Miller, is known as yet by specimens from Great Nicobar Island only. The smallest member of the group\u2014smaller even than *nicobaricus* or *mimus*, is *Sus andamanensis*, Blyth, from the Andaman Islands.\n\nThe paper contains full descriptions, keys and measurements, and is illustrated by many plates (amongst which are reproductions of a mounted *Sus barbatus*), of mandibular teeth and skulls in various aspects, all of which greatly facilitate the identification of the different species.\nMantra Gajah.\n\nBy W. George Maxwell.\n\nIn an article, which I contributed to the Society's Journal No. 45, and in which I gave a translation of a book of charms used by Malay elephant-drivers, I mentioned that I had in my possession another book of similar charms.\n\nIt consists of six sheets of stout paper, sewn down the middle so as to make a small book of twelve sheets or twenty-four pages. The outer cover has been stained a rich chocolate colour by the moisture of warm and perhaps not over clean hands and by the smoke of the fire-places over which the Malays keep, in hanging racks, the articles which they wish to preserve from damp. There is nothing in the book or on its cover to give any idea of its age, and Mat Jawi, the Assistant Penghulu of Kuala Plus, who gave it to me, could only say, in general terms, that it was old, and that it had been in his family for a long time. Mat Jawi is the grandson of the former Orang Kaya kaya Sri Adika Raja, and, as the book of which I have already given a translation is expressly stated to contain the hereditary lore \"that has come down from the Datohs Sri Adika Raja unto the present day,\" it is only to be expected that the charms set forth in the two books should closely resemble one another. This book begins abruptly without an introduction of any kind, and ends even more abruptly by reason of the available space on the paper being exhausted. In the last line, the writer started to give a charm to soften the heart of an elephant, and then, seeing that he had no more paper, scratched it out, and scribbled under it \"tamat\" \"the end.\"\n\nI here reproduce the book in its entirety in \"roman\" characters. I have not attempted to edit it in any way, of such part of it as is Malay no translation is necessary, and of such part of it as is not Malay I am unable to give a translation. I am inclined to think that the non-Malay charms are nothing but a corrupt form of Siamese, and to ascribe to\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nthem a much more recent period than I had suggested in my first article.\n\nIt is impossible to say when the Siamese first came down the Peninsula in search of elephants. Their own country has always been richly stocked with elephants; and at this day, from all accounts, there roam through the forests, in a semi-wild condition, herds of these great animals for which there is little or no commercial use. It is unlikely, therefore, that the Siamese should, at any early period, have gone far afield in search of animals for which there was but little demand in their own country; unless, of course, the search was one that was being made for the sacred white elephant.\n\nIt was perhaps not until the development of India and Burmah caused a demand for elephants for state ceremonies and for business purposes, and created a trade between Siam and these countries, that the Malay Peninsula was laid under contribution to supply elephants.\n\nThis trade in elephants was particularly referred to by Gemelli Careri, who in 1695 went from Goa to Malacca. He wrote in his \"Giro del Mondo\" (Vol. III. pp. 358, 359) an account, which is translated in Churchill's Voyages, Vol. IV. p. 284, as follows:\u2014\"all the country of Malacca, Cambaya \"Siam, Ciampa, Cocincinna and Tunchin abounds in elephants \"of which the Siamese particularly make a great trade, carry- \"ing them by land to the opposite coast and port of Tenas- \"zarin, belonging to the King of Siam, near the Gulf of Bengala, \"where merchants buy to transport them by sea into the \"dominions of Mahometan princes.\"\n\nThe extent to which this trade in elephants grew is shewn in the records of the India Office. The following notices of ships with elephants arriving at the port of Masulipatam, from Tenasserim alone, are taken from the Diary and Consultation Book of that factory.*\n\n| Date     | Event                          |\n|----------|--------------------------------|\n| April 25 | A ship with elephants          |\n| May 3    | A ship with 16                 |\n| April 21 | ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, |\n\n* Anderson's \"English Intercourse with Siam in the Seventeenth Century\" p. 20.\nFeb. 21 1682 ,, ship with 15 elephants.\nFeb. 22 1682 ,, ,, ,, 15 ,, \nFeb. 22 1682 A ,, ,, ,, 11 ,, \nApril 20 1682 ,, ,, ,, 6 ,, \nApril 22 1682 ,, ,, ,, 4 ,, \nMarch 1684 Two ships ,, ,, ,, 46 ,, \nApril 1684 A ship ,, ,, ,, 12 ,, \nApril 1684 ,, ,, ,, ,, 20 ,, \n\nThe Siamese who ransacked the Malay Peninsula to supply this surprising demand for elephants probably used the Mantra Gajah that are recorded in these manuscripts. But whether it was in the Seventeenth Century that the Malays learnt these Mantras, or whether their acquisition of this lore dates from a period before it or after it, can, until further information on the subject is forthcoming, only be matter for conjecture.\n\nMantra Gajah.\n\nBab ini hendak tiup tentang atau di-bacha pada batu di-limpar-kan pada gajah itu.\n\nIni-lah di-kata-nya\n\nOm kundanga ding kundanga sai teluwang tekulin dipin-tai rambut teluling di-hadapan tibalulon kakanan tibalulun kakiri sikab piah nenek-mu.\n\nHai gajah aku tahu asal angkau mula menjadi,\nMerkubulia ka-mulia asal mu,\nKau turut kata,\nJika tiada turut kata ku,\nMati di-bunoh Sri Rama;\nJika angkau turut kata ku\nDi-hidupi uleh Maha Risi.

B. ELCUM.\n\nI have seen few things so amusing as a game of chess played in a Malay village, with the whole population of the village standing round, and all of them who possess even the most rudimentary knowledge of the moves, \"assisting\" their champion with vociferous advice, and abusing his stupidity when he makes a move which for some reason, generally entirely wrong, they think inferior. The rule of \"touch and move\" is not generally observed among Malays. The spectators frequently will seize upon a piece which has been moved, replace it and make another move, pointing out how superior their method is. Very frequently the suggested improvement is absolutely futile, putting a piece \"en prise,\" or offering an obvious mate to the opponent, but the suggestor is quite unabashed when this is pointed out to him, and the fire of advice and remonstrance goes on until the game is over.\n\nThe appliances for these village games are generally of a very primitive character. There will be probably a rough hand-made lot of pieces, perhaps all of one colour, and a hand-made board. The squares of the board are never marked in different colours. Probably some of the men are missing, and various substitutes have to be provided; and sometimes there are no pawns, and their place has to be supplied by little stones, or bits of leaf.\n\nSometimes the pieces used by Malays bear more or less resemblance to the shapes with which we are familiar, except that the tir, the rook, is generally a flat piece like a draughtsman. But more usually they are much less distinctive in shape. The illustrations show a handsome set, gold and brown, kindly lent to me by one of the Johore Royal Family. It will be noticed that the board is uncoloured; the king, queen and pawns are all of the same shape, and distinguished by size only.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nThe rooks in this set are not of the usual flat description. As a rule the carving of the pieces is very rough, and it is seldom that one sees an elaborate set like that here illustrated. A set often suffices for a village. It is difficult to procure a genuine set of Malay chessmen.\n\nIn some parts of the Peninsula very few Malays play chess, in others a large proportion of the inhabitants. On the whole the proportion of men who can play chess more or less is probably greater than with most races. The same game is played in Sumatra as in the Peninsula, and I believe also in Borneo.\n\nHow the Malays acquired the game is a mystery. They may have done so from the Arabs, or they may have learnt it directly from natives of India. Neither the peculiar rules of the game, nor the names of pieces and terms used in play throw any light on this point. I give at the end of these notes a list of the words most commonly used in the game, and the languages from which they are derived, as given in Wilkinson's dictionary. The Sanscrit words seem as likely to have come through the Arabs, who learnt the game from India, as direct. Nor do Malay records shed any light on the way in which the game was introduced, so far as I have been able to discover. The most interesting points about the game are the similarities to, and the differences from, the game as now played in Europe, and as formerly played.\n\nThe board is 8 by 8 as in European chess, and the men except for the modifications to be pointed out, have the same moves and powers. They are the King (raja) the Queen (menteri, minister), two Bishops (gajah, elephant), two knights (kuda, horse), two Rooks (tir, a name which appears to have no other meaning), and 8 pawns (bidak, also only the name of this piece).\n\nThe first great difference between the Malay game and ours, and one which entirely upsets all book knowledge of the openings which may have been acquired by a student of our game, when he attempts to play the Malay game, is in the arrangements of the pieces. With us king stands opposite king and queen opposite queen. In Malay chess the menteri stands\non the right of his king, and is so opposite to the opposing king.\n\nIn the early days of European chess occasional modifications appear to have been made in the position of the pieces at starting, before the game had settled to its present strict form. I have not seen any mention of the Malay method of arranging the men, but we read of games starting with a \"tabiyat\" or battle array, which seems to have taken many forms, in which the pieces were arranged in positions quite different from the normal starting arrangement and it is probable that the relative positions of king and queen were not always in early days entirely settled.\n\nHowever that may be, the next variation between Malay chess and ours is certainly a survival of a rule, now dead, which prevailed at one time in Europe.\n\nThe Malay king, provided he has not been checked or moved, has the privilege of once leaping like a knight, or of moving over two squares whether another piece intervenes a not, laterally but not forward or diagonally. He can thus practically castle, but in two moves instead of one. Castling as we know it is not a part of the Malay game.\n\nThe \"king's leap\" was recognised in Europe in mediaeval chess before the present method of castling was generally adopted.\n\nThe results of this power of the king are very disconcerting to a player unused to the Malay game. Thus an unguarded knight giving check can be taken by the king, or in a crowded position the king skips away from an otherwise fatal check by a knight's move or over another piece. In playing Malay chess at first, it is very common to overlook this curious privilege of the king. The Malays frequently give what would otherwise be an aimless check in order to deprive the king of this power. I have not played the game sufficiently to be sure whether it would be generally advisable to do this between even players\u2014whether the loss of one or two moves involved in giving the check is made up for by the king's loss of his privilege. But it is certainly advisable for a European skilful at his own form of chess, but a novice at Malay chess,\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nto endeavour to force the king to move only in the way to which he is accustomed, even at the loss of a little time.\n\nA pawn is taken \"en passant\" at Malay chess, as with us. That a refinement of the game such as this should exist among a primitive race is curious, but it is well established.\n\nThe rules of the game mentioned so far contain nothing which might not have been naturally developed from the same form of the game which produced chess as now played in Europe. The curious rules in force among Malays with regard to the promotion of a pawn appear to be peculiar to Malay chess only, and to have no parallel, so far as I can discover, in other forms of chess, ancient or modern.\n\nIn Europe any pawn reaching the eighth rank can at once become a queen or any other piece at the option of the player. In Malay chess a rook's pawn, so reaching the 8th rank, may become a ment\u00e9ri or any other piece immediately, except that it can only become a piece which is off the board; it cannot become a ment\u00e9ri if the ment\u00e9ri has not been taken. Should, however, the pawn so advancing to the eighth rank be on any other file, it does not acquire the privilege until it has played back diagonally a sufficient number of moves to enable it to reach the rook's file. Thus a pawn reaching knight's eighth has to play back diagonally one square, on reaching bishop's eighth, two squares, and on king's or queen's eighth, three squares. It is not necessary to actually play the pawn to the rook's file, but it must play back sufficiently far to have reached it. This curious rule makes winning by the odd pawn more difficult than in the European game.\n\nThere are other rules which tend to make it easier for the weaker force to draw. The king if left alone on the board must be mated in not more than seven moves or the game is drawn. When the stronger force is barely sufficient to mate, or the position is such as to make it difficult to mate in a few moves, Malay players of the weaker force frequently try to force the capture of these last remaining pawns or pieces, in the hope of escaping defeat by this rule.\n\nMate cannot be given by a discovered check. It is not good form to exchange queens unless the game can be immediately\nwon or saved by doing so. A prejudice against the exchange is very common amongst beginners in Europe. There is, of course, no reason for this, but in Malay chess there is some. The rules as to queening a pawn, and as to the lone king make it so difficult to win a pawn ending that it is seldom advisable for the stronger force to clear the board by exchanges.\n\nThese rules, which make it easier for the weaker force to draw, are to my mind a weak point in the Malay game, which otherwise is probably equal in essentials to our own. It is certainly a pleasant change to play a game in which no openings have been analysed, and in which the player has to rely entirely on himself from the very beginning of the game.\n\nMalays generally open with a fianchetto to avoid exposing the king to an early check. Whether this is the best method of beginning I cannot say. Few Malays are really strong at the game, though a considerable number play respectably.\n\nThe point of most interest with regard to the game is how the special rules which differ from those of other forms of chess, were evolved\u2014whether they are a survival of the form of chess originally taught to the Malays, or whether they have been invented by the Malays themselves.\n\nTerms commonly used in Malay Chess.\n\n| English   | Malay          | Derivation according to Wilkinson's Dictionary. |\n|-----------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Chess     | Chator         | Sanskrit (chaturanga)                           |\n| Chessmen  | Buah Chator    | (Bauh = fruit)                                  |\n| King      | Raja           | Sanskrit                                        |\n| Queen     | Ment\u00e9ri        | (Minister) Sanskrit                             |\n| Rook      | Tir            |                                                 |\n| Bishop    | Gajah (elephant)| Sanskrit                                       |\n| Knight    | Kuda (horse)   |                                                 |\n| Pawn      | Bidak          | Arabic                                          |\n| Check     | Sah            | Persian                                         |\n\nR.A.Soc.No.49,1907.\nEnglish Malay Derivation according to Wilkinson's Dictionary.\n\nMate Mat\nDraw S\u00ebri Sanskrit\nTo take Makan\nTo take \"en passant\" Makan bidak suap.\n(suap = mouthful or bribe)\n\nThe origin of \"tir\" is doubtful.\nThe words \"buah,\" \"kuda,\" \"makan,\" \"suap,\" are probably pure Malay.\n\n\"Mat\" apparently comes from the same source as \"Sah.\"\nIf \"Sah\" is derived from the Persian, so probably is \"mat.\"\n\"Sah Mat\" may mean \"the king is dead.\"\nNote on the Malay Game 'Jongkak.'\n\nBY M. HELLIER.\n\nI lately obtained, and sent to the Raffles Museum for exhibition, the playing board and seeds for the Malay game \"Jongkak.\"\n\nHaji Othman the Visiting Teacher of Province Wellesley, from whom I obtained the board, describes Jongkak as a women's game originally played by the ladies at the courts of the Malay Rajas. The playing board is shaped like a junk or boat, and, according to Haji Othman, the name of the game is derived from \"jong\" a junk. The board has 7 holes on each side, with a larger hole or compartment at each end.\n\nThe game is one for two people and is usually played with Tamarind or other seeds, but marbles are now sometimes used. Each player has one \"village\" (kampong) or row of holes, and in each side hole she places 7 seeds. The board is then ready for play.\n\nThe players start together. Each player taking the 7 seeds from the hole on her right and carrying them from right to left, drops one in each hole, the last seed falling into the large hole at the end. This seed is said to have \"entered the house\" (naik rumah) and this house belongs to the player on whose left it lies.\n\nEach player then takes all the seeds from any one of the other holes in her \"village\" and moving as before from right to left around the board again drops a seed into each hole, taking care to drop one into her own 'house' but none into her opponent's.\n\nShould the last seed fall into an empty hole the player is dead (mati), and must wait until the other player is 'dead' before she can again play. If this hole is in the player's own \"village\" any seeds in the opposite hole on her opponent's side may be taken and put into the \"house.\" This is said to be (?) \"a sacrifice\" (mati b\u00e9la).\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nWhen the last seed falls into a hole in which there are other seeds, these are taken and the player continues in play, and should the last seed fall into the player's \"house\" she also continues in play, taking the seeds from any hole in her \"village.\"\n\nWhen no more seeds remain in a player's \"village\" she is said to be \"once defeated\" (kalah sa-papan). She may however, take any seeds there may be in her \"house\" and place them again in the holes in her \"village\" putting 7 in a hole as before. Should any holes be left empty they are called \"ruined wells\" (telaga burok) and the player owning \"ruined wells\" must wait until her opponent is dead before playing again.\n\nThe game goes on in this way until a player has lost all her seeds. She is then \"utterly destroyed\" (mati kena abu). Skeat, who calls the game \"chongkak,\" gives a short description of it in his \"Malay Magic.\"\nConcerning some old Sanskrit Inscriptions in the Malay Peninsula.\n\nBY PROFESSOR H. KERN.\n\nExtract from 'De Verslagen en Mededeelingen der Koninklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen.' Division 'Literature' 3rd Series. Part I.*\n\nTo complete my former communications in these pages upon the history of writing in the Indian Archipelago, I now desire to consider some inscriptions in the Malay Peninsula. Of these inscriptions, discovered by Colonel Low and published by him in facsimil\u00e9, one only has come down to us perfect; the rest are very fragmentary.\n\nThe first inscription was found in Kedah. It was engraved on a stone\u2014a kind of slate\u2014under the floor of a ruined building which had once measured ten to twelve feet square. This circumstances together with the contents of the inscription lead us to suspect that the building may have been the hut (kuti) of a Buddhist monk. A transliteration and translation of the inscription were published by J. W. Laidlay in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal XVIII 247 (1). Although this gentleman who was at the time of the publication Secretary of the Asiatic Society has noticed the chief points in the inscription which call for comment, I give my own transliteration of it which differs in a few minor points from his. It runs thus:\n\n*Note.\u2014This translation is published with Professor Kern's permission.\n\n(1) The facsimile on plate X. (This paper and plate are republished on pages 232-234 of Volume I of 'Miscellaneous papers relating to Indo-China,' reprinted for the Straits Branch Royal Asiatic Society London 1886).\n\nJour. Straits Branch, R. A. Soc. No. 49, 1907.\nYe dharm\u0101 hetuprabhav\u0101 tesh\u0101 (m) Tath\u0101gato (hy avadat)?\n\nYesh\u0101 (m) ca yo nirodho eva (m) w\u0101vi Mah\u0101\u00e7ramana (h)\nAj\u00f1\u0101c ciyate karma (sic) jenmana-karma k\u0101ranam\nJn\u0101n\u0101n na kriyate karmma (sic) karm\u0101bh\u0101v\u0101 (n) na j\u0101yate\n\nThe first couplet in halting \u0101ry\u0101-measure is the well known Buddhist creed-formula and need not detain us. The second in Anushtubh can be translated thus:\n\n'It is through lack of knowledge that the Karma (2) accumulates. The Karma is the cause that men must be reborn. Through knowledge (of the nature of things) it comes about that men effect no (more) Karma and from the absence of Karma it follows that men need not be born (again).\n\nThe idea expressed in the couplet is by no means exclusively Buddhistic but seeing that it follows immediately after the better known formula there can be no doubt that the sentence must be regarded here as the profession of faith of a disciple of S\u0101kya. We shall find the same phrase further on in another and indubitably Buddhist inscription from Province Wellesley. Elsewhere in British India and in Ceylon it is usually another sentence which we find coupled with the formula Ye dharm\u0101 etc. I mean the couplet in Dhammapada stanza 183 (edited by Prof. Fausb\u00f6ll).\n\nSabbap\u0101pass\u2019 akar\u0101nam kusalass\u2019 upasampad\u0101\nSacittaparyodapanam, etam buddh\u0101na s\u0101sanam.\n\ni.e. to refrain from all evil, to apply oneself to the good, to purify one\u2019s heart: that is the bidding of the Buddhas (the wise).\n\nThe couplet runs thus with a slight difference in the halting Sanskrit of Tibet:\n\nSarvap\u0101pasy\u0101karanam, ku\u00e7alasyopasampadam\n\n(2) i.e. the sum of good and evil actions which is the cause of man\u2019s remaining shackled to life and unable to escape from incarnation.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nSvacittaparidamanam, etad buddh\u0101nu\u00e7\u0101sanam (3)\n\nBetween the two formulas Ye dharm\u0101 &c., and Sarvap\u0101pasya &c., there is no more necessary connection than between the former and the sentence aj\u00f1\u0101n\u0101c ciyate &c. There is therefore nothing strange in finding as the second couplet first the one sentence and then the other (4). The second inscription in which the couplet \u0101\u00f1j\u0101n\u0101c &c., is found, was dug up by Colonel Low in the North of Province Wellesley (5). The inscribed stone seems to have been the upper part of a column. On a copy of this ancient record which was published in 1835 without any explanation (6) can be seen the representation of a st\u016bpa, the under part of which is formed by a sphere and not as usually by a hemisphere. Above the sphere rises a row of so-called umbrellas. On either side stands a line of writing. On the right side can be read:\n\nAj\u00f1\u0101n\u0101c ciyate kamma janmanah kamma k\u0101rana (m)\n\nOf the writing on the left side I can only make out the word j\u00f1\u0101na (7) Fortunately what is left is sufficient proof that the inscription, apart from certain differences in spelling, is identical with the second couplet on the Kedah stone. That stone reads janmana with a 'Jihv\u0101m\u016bliya' whilst the inscription on the pillar spells the same words with a 'visarga.'\n\nBesides this two-lined verse the pillar has also another inscription along the edge. Beginning from the top on the right-hand side we can recognise the inscription given in facsimile on Plate IV in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal XVII 2 and numbered 8 (8) It runs:\n\n(3) See Csoma K\u00f6r\u00f6si in J. As. Soc. B. IV 134 Cp. Spence Hardy Manual of Buddhism 198.\n\n(4) Already noticed by B. H. Hodgson in J. As. Soc. B. IV 211.\n\n(5) J. As. Soc. B. XVII 2, 64 (Misc, Papers relating to Indo-China. Vol. I. 223-226).\n\n(6) J. As. Soc. B. IV pl. III.\n\n(7) On the facsimile No. 10 on Pl. IV of J. A. S. B. XVII 2 the second line is almost entirely missing.\n\n(8) The transliteration and translation given by Babu Rajendralal Mitra bear little resemblance to it.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nMah\u0101n\u0101vika-Buddhaguptasya Raktamrittik\u0101v\u0101sa.\n\ni.e. of the eminent shipowner Buddhagupta, resident at Raktamrittik\u0101 (9). The words following these cannot be made out with certainty, possibly sya (sign of genitive) d\u0101n\u0101m (gift) or deyadharmah (pious donation). Even less can we decide if anything was written on the broken foot of the pillar.\n\nOn the left hand side beginning at the top we read\u2014Sarvven\u0101 prak\u0101rena sarvvasm\u0101t sarvvath\u0101 sarvv\u0101\u2014Then follows a gap until at the end of a second line we see:\n\nSiddhay\u0101n\u0101sanna.\n\nWhat is left of the first line can be translated word for word: 'In every way, from every thing, in every respect, all'... Siddhay\u0101n\u0101sanna might mean 'who has performed a successful journey' but it is impossible to decide with certainty that that is the meaning; too much of the sentence is missing to allow of its restoration to its original form.\n\nDespite the incompleteness of these inscriptions which all appear to be by the same hand it is probable that the monument is the gift of a pious Buddhist sea-trader to a temple. As regards the man's residence, Raktamrittik\u0101 i.e. Red-earth I would remark that the Chinese accounts make frequent mention of a port in the Gulf of Siam Chih-tu 'Red-earth' (see Groeneveldt in Verhand.: Batav.: Genootschap XXXIX8 2-101) (10) That is probably the place meant.\n\nThe style of writing of Buddhagupta's inscription agrees exactly with the type found in Wenggi and in Tjampda in West Java. The agreement is so striking that I have no hesitation in regarding the inscriptions from Wenggi, Tjampa and\n\n(9) Mrittik\u0101 is a misspelling for m\u1e5bttika. A similar mistake is found in kritwa in an inscription at Ajanta (Pl. XXI in No. 9 of the Archaeological Survey of Western India by J. Burgess Cp. No. 10 page 79 inscrip. 7) and elsewhere. The mistake is explained by the fact that in many parts of India r is pronounced as ri.\n\n(10) Misc. papers relating to Indo-China Second Series Vol. I page 205, 242.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nProvince Wellesley as being of approximately the same date i.e. as belonging to the same century. The inscriptions from Wenggi were determined by Burnell\u2014too early lost to science!\u2014as being of the fourth century (11) and in my opinion, (the grounds for which I have already published) the views of that scholar cannot be far wrong. I should therefore give the date of Buddhagupta's inscription as being roughly 400 A.D. (12) It is undoubtedly the oldest Buddhist fragment yet found in these parts unless indeed the Kedah inscription is given the preference. In view of the fact that the characters in the two inscriptions notably differ\u2014especially in the ka and na and that the difference in type points to different places of origin, a comparison of the two can lead to no reliable conclusion.\n\nDifferent again is the type of some of the rock-inscriptions at Tokun, a place lying in the middle of Province Wellesleys. The seven fragments copied by Colonel Low and published on Plate IV (13) of the Journal mentioned are so small and, in part, so indistinct that they have no value except as contributions to palaeography.\n\nNo. 1 I can decipher in part only. It begins with sarvva which is written quite distinctly and in nearly the same type of characters as is Buddhagupta's inscription. The word following seems to represent \u00e1rama or \u00e1ramam\u2014monastery-garden. The remaining few groups of letters are indecipherable.\n\nNo. 2 is in different characters which seem to me, judging from the great development of the vowel-sign for i. to be not older than the 6th century. The type reminds me of that\n\n(11) South Indian Palaeography Pl. XX and XXI.\n\n(12) The oldest inscriptions in the Talaing Country in Pegu are in the same Wenggi-type and according to Dr. E. Forchammer date from the fourth Century A.D. 'The oldest Talaing inscriptions date back to the 4th Century A.D. and the lythic characters are almost identical with the Dravidian-Vengi alphabet of the same period.' See notes on Buddhist Law by the Judicial Commissioner British Burma (John Jardine) III Marriage page X.\n\n(13) (Misc. Papers relating to Indo-China Vol. I page 231).\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nat Djamboe and of that at Pattadakal in the Deccan and also of the oldest Cambodian inscriptions of Bhavavarman. The two first words are quite clear; they are *prathame vayasi* i.e. 'in time of youth.' The reading of the next two groups of letters which stand in the same line, is however uncertain. I would read *n\u0101vvi* since this combination is intelligible. The second line I can make nothing of; the three last groups of letters might, allowing for defective writing, represent *dvividham*.\n\nThe two first letter-groups in No. 4 are *jaya*. In No. 5 I read with some diffidence 48. No. 6 might represent *siddhi*.\n\nThese fragments of inscriptions from Tokun do not, like those from Kedah and from the temple ruins in Province Wellesley, bear a clear stamp of Buddhist origin. The most noteworthy point of this respect is the word *\u0101r\u0101ma*\u2014the reading of which is unfortunately not beyond doubt. Fortunately it is clear from the other inscriptions that Buddhist establishments existed in the Malay Peninsula at the period to which the earliest Brahman and Hindu remains in Western Java are referred.\n\nWith the exception of the inscriptions mentioned no others have, I believe, been found in the Malay Peninsula itself, but one which formerly stood on a large rock at the entrance of Singapore River, is worthy of description. In the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for 1837 (14) there is a drawing of this ancient record which shews that even then it had suffered considerably. Later on, shortly previous to the year 1848, the stone was apparently removed and so damaged that a few years later only fragments of it could be found. Mr. Laidlay so far succeeded in deciphering some of the pieces that he was able to give a facsimile. He rightly recognised the Kawi characters in the writing and he came to the conclusion that the language of the inscription was also Kawi. This conclusion was certainly legitimate though Mr. Laidlay could not have known that the Kawi alphabet was at one time used in Java for Sanskrit inscriptions.\n\n(14) (Misc. Papers Indo-China Vol. Igepa 219).\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nI have attempted to decipher the three fragments published by Mr. Laidlay and to determine the language of the inscription but I must confess that I have not succeeded. Most of the characters can be recognised singly but the gaps are so numerous that no words can be positively recognised. Thus I read in the third line of figure 1 the letter-groups sal\u00e1gala-lasayananara; in the second line of figure 2 ya-\u00e1m\u00e1navana; in the third line kesarabharala in the sixth line of figure 3 yadalama. Granted that no vowel-marks and Anussw\u0101ra's have been omitted in the facsimile, I see no chance of so dividing these letter-groups as to make an unmistakeable Javanese word. I cannot however assert that the inscription is written in any other language.\n\nIn a work entitled 'The Malayan Peninsula' by Captain Begbie quoted by Mr. Laidlay, reasons are given for believing that inscription dates from the reign of Cri-R\u0101ja Wikrama (1223-1236). Palaeography is not opposed to the conjecture.\n\nAs regards the question, which of the Kawi types\u2014that of Java or of Sumatra, the characters on the Singapore inscription most resemble, some letters, notably ma, which in Javanese Kawi differ markedly from those found in Sumatra, reappear in their Javanese form on the Singapore stone and I therefore believe that we must assign the inscription to the Javanese type. Ma is the most characteristic letter in these alphabets since it is different both in later Cambodian in the time of s\u016bryavarman (15) and in the Sumatran Kawi. On the other hand the form for sa is common to both Sumatran and Javanese Kawi and different in the later Cambodian.\n\nIt is to be feared that the Singapore record has been damaged beyond hope of restoration; so much the more reason for fixing our attention on the little of it that remains in transcription.\n\n(15) In my paper on the Koetei inscription, I assumed on the strength of one date that Suryawarman reigned in the 8th century of Caka; it appears however from the investigations of Messrs. Aymonier and Bergaigne that this date is two centuries too early, see the remarks of the latter savant in the Journal Asiatique (February March 1882) Note 4.\n\nR. A.

GEORGE MAXWELL.\n\nI have found in an old note book the following jottings of folk lore picked up by me at various times from Pa' Senik, an old Kelantan Malay now resident in Kinta. They are mere trivial disconnected scraps, but are perhaps worth recording.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"When one leaves the house to go hunting deer, one ought, in order to avert from oneself any evil consequences, to repeat this mantra,\n\n\"Bukan aku yang memburu,\n\"Pawang Do Resat yang memburu.\"\n\nPa' Senik was unable to tell me anything about Pawang Do Resat or his connection with deer, but supplied the following information about deer generally.\n\n\"The first hunter of rusa was Pa' Chu Seming.* Upon his death, which took place in the rimba he became a hantu rusa.\n\n\"His son Jitan died in the bluker, and likewise became a hantu. He looks after the kijang, pelandok and jungle fowl.\n\n\"Nang Peluntong Chai was the wife of Pa' Chu Seming. She died in the padang. It is she who sends the deer away before a drive begins, if the preliminary propitiatory ceremonies have not been duly performed.\n\n\"After the death of these three, the next hunters of deer were Cho Resat, Do Resat, Pran Ali, Pran Rasu, Pran Maiar and Putri Bongsu.\"\n\n* Another account, recorded in considerable detail in a Ms. (written by a Perak Malay) which I hope to have ready for the next number of this journal, makes out that Pa' Chu Seming became the Hantu Pemburu, the Great Spectral Huntsman.\n\nJour.

(Some Malays tell you that the batu lintar is a weapon which the Jins hurl at one another in their fights). Pa' Senik supplemented this account by saying that it is dangerous to keep in one's house a perfect batu lintar as it has life. A batu lintar that has been chipped in any way is however dead, and therefore harmless. The live batu lintar will attract lightning to the house, and then disappear in the flash.\n\n* * * *\n\n\"The sun and earth had once human form, the sun being \"the male and the earth the female.

If so, can any one say what the sea-shell is, and what the legend connected with it is?\n\nThis hill, which is perhaps the Sagatang Maka Miru of the Sejarah Malayu, is connected with the Perak regalia in the following lullaby [which was published on page 76 of the \"Notes and Queries\" of the Society].\n\nMangqueta nama-nya kayu,\nDoun-nya luruh menelentang,\nMahkota raja Malayu\nTurun deri Bukit Saguntang.\n\nII\nDaun-nya huroh meneletang,\nDaun puan di-raut-raut.\nTurun deri Bukit Seguntang,\nKaluar deri dalam laut.\n\nW.G.M.\nBark Canoes among the Jakuns and Dyaks.\n\nBy Dr. W. L. Abbott.\n\n(See Plate I, fig. 2).\n\nAs no one seems to have noticed the use of bark canoes in Malaya, the following note may be of interest:\n\nIn July, 1902, during a trip up the Rumpin River in Pahang, I saw the Jakuns using some roughly made conoes of bark. It was meranti bark as well as I can remember. Their use was said to be confined to the Jekati and Keratong tributaries of the Ulu Rumpin.\n\nThey were but little trouble to make and the Jakuns brought down large cargoes of Rattans and other jungle produce in them. They did not always take the trouble to take them back up stream again, or to repair them when split or damaged.\n\nI did not measure any of these \"rapak,\" as they are called in the Rumpin, but they were 4 or 5 metres long.\n\nI sent a specimen to the National Museum in Washington, but it warped very much out of shape when drying.\n\nThe bark is removed from the tree in one large sheet. The ends are cut square and stitched up with small rattan.\n\nRibs are placed transversely about 18 inches apart, and straight sticks are lashed transversely across at corresponding places to hold the sides in position. A large split rattan encloses the edge of the gunwale. The sewn ends are freely cauled with mud or clay.\n\nIn July 1907, I found similar canoes in use among the Dyaks of the Semundung and Ulu Sempang Rivers, West Borneo. Slightly more roughly made if possible\u2014a thick spongy bark is used containing much resin(?). The same bark is much used as flooring by Malays and Dyaks. The Malays said it was the bark of bintangor batu (?).\n\nJour, Straits Branch, R. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nThe Dyaks dispense with the split rattan along the gunwales, as they use a much stronger and thicker bark than the Jakuns. These canoes in no way compare with the elaborate birch bark structures of the North American Amerinds, but they are very easily and quickly made. I was told that two Dyaks could make a large canoe in half a day. The Dyaks had no special name for them\u2014they used a term which I can't recall, but it meant only bark canoe (according to the Malays).\nTin Coins from Brunei.\nTin and Lead Coins from Brunei.\n\nBy R. Hanitsch, Ph.D.\n\nWith Plate III.\n\nThe curious tin and lead coins from Brunei, Borneo, described below, were, with one exception, exhibited at the Kuala Kangsar Agricultural Show, August, 1907, by Mr. Edmund Roberts, of the P.W.D., Labuan, and subsequently presented by him, on behalf of Pangeran Shabander, of Brooketon, Brunei, to the Raffles Museum, Singapore. They had been found in an earthenware jar, buried two or three feet below the surface, at Brooketon, in July, 1907. A number of coins were in the jar, but most of them were seized by natives and cannot now be found. Those which reached the Raffles Museum were of two types only. A few months later Mr. Roberts presented to the Museum a third kind of coin which he had found when clearing the site for the Brunei residency, in 1906.\n\nThe first two coins differ only slightly from each other; one of them is of a simpler design and in a less perfect state of preservation, so that it may be considered as the older one. It is 36 mm. in diameter, 1 mm. in thickness and weighs 5.9 grammes (see pl. III, fig. 1). It is more or less of pure tin, its specific gravity being 7.5 (that of tin is 7.29). Its obverse shows a recumbent buffalo, minus its horns, with erect tail, the space between the figure and the edge of the coin being filled up by circles, cloud-like scrolls, and dots.\n\nThe reverse bears an inscription, in Malay characters, which is arranged in what Lane Poole* calls the \"mill-sail pattern,\" a pattern which is met with on Persian and other coins, the writing being placed within the four arms of the sail-wheel. The division into four fields is effected by a line which starts from near the centre of the coin, runs parallel\n\n* See O. Codrington, A Manual of Musalman Numismatics, London, 1904, p. 17.\n\nJour. Straits Branch, R.A.Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nand somewhat to one side of the radius, then turns along the periphery, follows it for nearly 90\u00b0, runs back along the next radius, and having thus enclosed the first field which is somewhat smaller than a quadrant, crosses the centre and continues to form a second, third and fourth field, within the second, third and fourth quadrants respectively. The inscription is\n\n\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0644 \u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0638\u0627\u0647\u0631\n\nor in Romanized characters:\n\nSultan ul-adil malik ul-dhahir,\n\ni.e. The just Sultan, the acknowledged Ruler.\n\nI am indebted to Mr. M. Hellier for kindly deciphering this coin for me. Unfortunately neither the year nor the name of the sultan is given, nor have I any other data to fix even approximately the age and the origin of the coin. There were four specimens of it.\n\nThe second type (see pl. III, fig. 2) is practically of the same size as the first one; viz. 36 mm. in diameter and 1 mm. in thickness, and is only slightly lighter, viz. 5.7 grammes. It is also of tin. It may be of later date as it is better preserved and its design is somewhat more elaborate. There is only one specimen of it.\n\nThe obverse shows again the figure of a recumbent buffalo, but with the tail curled downwards. The buffalo with its scroll work is enclosed by a circle, the space between the circle and the margin of the coin, about 4 mm. across, being filled up by a zig-zag line.\n\nThe reverse contains the same inscription as the first coin, also arranged in mill-sail pattern. Like the figure on the obverse, the inscription is enclosed by a circular line, the space between the latter and the margin of the coin containing a series of dots.\n\nThe third coin, found by Mr. Roberts when clearing the site for the Brunei residency, in 1906, is of lead. It measures 30 mm. in diameter, 1.5 mm. in thickness and weighs 10.6 grammes (see pl. III, fig. 3). Its specific gravity is 10.1, that\nof pure lead being $11.37$, the slight difference probably being due to impurities and oxidation.\n\nThe obverse shows the (yellow) State umbrella, one of the insignia of Malay royalty, surmounted by the Sultan's (yellow) flag. The other leaf-like ornamentations have probably no special significance.\n\nThe reverse bears the inscription\n\n\u0627\u064a\u0646\u0644\u0647 \u062a\u064a\u062a\u0627\u0647\n\u0641\u0631\u0646\u0646\u0647 \u0643\u0645\u063a\u0627\u0641\u0627\u0646\u0646\n\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0633 \u0628\u0644\u0646\u062c\u0627 \u0646\u062c\u0631\u064a\n\u0628\u0631\u0648\u0646\u064a \u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e \u064a\n\u0661\u0662\u0668\u0665\n\nor in Romanized characters\n\nInilah titah\nperentah kamuafakan\natan ka'atas b\u0113lanja\nNegri Brunei tarikh y\n1285\n\nmeaning\n\nBy order\nof the administration\nof the Finances\nof the State of Brunei\ndate 1868.\n\nThe dates 1285 and 1868 refer, of course, to the Hejira and to the Christian era respectively, and Abdul Mumin was Sultan of Brunei at that time.\n\nI am indebted to the united efforts of the Rev. Dr. Luer ing and of Messrs. Hellier, McArthur and Elcum for deciphering this coin for me.\n\nP. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nAlthough this coin is of such a recent date, only forty years old, I have not been able to discover any more specimens of it.

The Treasurer's account was also passed.\n\nIt was resolved that the members of the society were desirous of expressing their sense of the loss which the society had sustained by the departure from the East of the Right Reverend Bishop Hose D.D., their President, on his well-deserved retirement after a period of over forty years. It was to him, the Founder of the Society in 1877 that the\nsociety was indebted for its inception and for its continuance for thirty years, during which he occupied the position of President almost without a break, till the actual date of his retirement. He also contributed on various occasions to its Journal and in every way possible assisted in the furthering of the objects of the society.\n\nA letter from Mr. H. C. Robinson was read stating that a scheme for the systematic study of the Fauna of the Peninsula had been laid down. The Reptiles, Batrachians and birds had been well studied but the mammals had been as yet little investigated. The Government of the F. M. S. had sanctioned the insertion of a certain sum of money in the estimates for the purpose and it was suggested that the society might provide a substantial grant to be devoted to the same purpose. Eventually the sum $500 a year for three years was voted.\n\nThe officers for the ensuing year were then elected viz.\n\nPresident: Dr. Galloway.\nVice-President Singapore: W. D.

Bishop Hose was the founder of the Society in the year 1877 and was the last member of the original council of the Society in the Straits Settlements. He was the first president of the society and occupied that position almost without break till his retirement in February of this year.\n\nDuring the past year, the Hon. Secretary, Mr. H. N. Ridley was absent on leave for nine months and Mr. Hellier kindly acted for him.\n\nA journal No. 48 was issued and another No. 49 is ready for distribution to the Members.\n\nA Map Committee was formed to bring out a new edition of the map, the old edition being sold out, and they commenced the work of compiling and revising.\n\nAn Index to the Journal was compiled by Mr. W. D Barnes and offered to the Society. It was decided to complete and publish it when volume 50 was published.\n\nA number of books and pamphlets were added by presentation to the Library of the Society.\n\nThe Treasurer's report is appended.\n### HONORARY TREASURER\u2019S ACCOUNT FOR THE YEAR 1907.\n\n| Description                                                        | Amount (c$) |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Balance brought forward                                           |             |\n| Methodist Publishing House\u2014Printing                             | 623         |\n| Journeys and Evans\u2014Books                                         | 95          |\n| Abu Baker\u2014Book binding                                           | 23          |\n| Peoris\u2019 Salary                                                    | 60          |\n| Clerks\u2019 Salary                                                   | 24          |\n| Mercantile Bank, Current Account                                  |             |\n| Charged Bank, Fixed Deposit                                      | 230         |\n| Chargered Bank, Fixed Deposit                                    | 270         |\n| Mercantile Bank, Fixed Deposit                                   | 200         |\n| Mercantile Bank, Fixed Deposit\u2014Chartered Bank, Fixed Fixed        | 10          |\n| Chargered Bank, Fixed Deposit                                     | 385         |\n| Deposit                                                          | 1907        |\n| Subscription for 1905                                             | 1908        |\n| Life Membership                                                  | 340         |\n| Sale of Journals                                                 | 58          |\n| Sale of Maps                                                     | 67          |\n| Bank Interest, Fixed Deposits                                    | 360         |\n| Deposits                                                         | 1412        |\n| Accounts                                                         | 6495        |\n| Chargered Bank, Current Account                                   | 425         |\n| Mercantile Bank, Current Account                                  | 2300        |\n| Direct Deposit                                                   | 1907        |\n| Deposit                                                          | 1906        |\n| Balance carried forward\u2014Mercantile Bank, Fixed                   | 10          |\n| Chargered Bank, Fixed Depost                                     | 270         |\n| Deposit                                                          | 385         |\n| Deposit                                                          | 100         |\n| Cash in hand                                                     | 991         |\n| Foreign exchange equenes                                          | 5865        |\n| Postages, petites and discount on foreign                         | 292         |\n| Otherated Bank, Current Account                                  | 68          |\n| Account                                                          | 56          |\n| Mercantile Bank, Current Accounts                                 | 63          |\n| Abu Baker\u2014Book binding                                           | 23          |\n\n### Audited and found correct,\n\nR.

Ridley, F.R.S.\n\nAs might be expected in a wet tropical forest region such as the Malay Peninsula, the number of ferns is very large, no less than 382 species being recorded, and further the number of individuals is so large that they form a very conspicuous feature in the forests and damp open spots.\n\nThat the number of species occurring here will be very largely increased by further discoveries may be taken as certain, for there still remains a very large area of the country especially in the centre and northern part of the peninsula which has not as yet been investigated by the lovers of ferns.\n\nThe ferns of the plain country of the west coast are probably pretty well known and the Thaiping Hills and some of the other hill-ranges have been the collecting grounds of Day, Scorzechini, and Kunstler. The ferns of Penang were well collected by Curtis, but the hill-ranges of Selangor and Pahang and the low country of the east coast have as yet been only partially searched and that mainly by myself. The northern states on the borders of Siam have been hardly investigated at all, and are likely to produce many additions to our flora.\n\nIn following the arrangement of Beddome's Ferns of British India, I have incorporated into the list some species recorded by him from definite localities in the peninsula which have not been seen by me. There are however a good many recorded by him as from \"Malay peninsula\" without special localities, and which have not been apparently met with again. These I have excluded at present as some authors include Tenasserim as part of the Malay peninsula and the plants thus vaguely localised may have been obtained across the border.\n\nJour. Straits Branch, R. A. Soc., No. 50, 1908.\nI am indebted to Dr. Christ of Basle for identification of many species, as well as to Bishop Hose, and Surgeon General C. T. Matthew, who always spent his spare time in Singapore during the short stays of his ship in searching the forests of Singapore for ferns, with no little success.\n\nThe chief collectors of ferns in the peninsula have been Father Scortechini, Mr. Day, Mr. Kunstler, who collected for the Calcutta Gardens, Mr. Hullett, Right Reverend Bishop Hose, Mr. Curtis and in earlier days W. Norris, Lady Dalhousie, Mr. Pinwill, Dr. Wallich and Cuming.\n\nHabitats. The most abundant and conspicuous fern is perhaps the well-known \"Resam\" *Gleichenia linearis* which covers considerable tracts of country on the edges of forest, and where the forest has been felled and burnt. In such spots it produces dense thickets very troublesome to penetrate. In the hill districts it is replaced by other species of *Gleichenia*, *G. hirta*, *G. glauca* and *G. flagellaris*. In more sandy places in the low country, we find the common bracken, *Pteris aquilina* taking its place. This is probably the most widely distributed and abundant of any vascular plant in the world. It is remarkable too how little this plant varies in different regions of the globe. There is but little visible difference between the bracken of the woods of Kent and that of the hot sandy country of Singapore, the chief difference being the more woody texture of the stalks in the tropical form.\n\nAnother fern which forms thick masses is the local *Matonia pectinata* of Mount Ophir and others of our higher hills. This beautiful fern often occurs growing in close thickets, like bracken.\n\n*Dipteris Horsfieldii* grows in a similar manner over the sea-coast cliffs and on clay banks at 2000 feet and upwards in close masses. It is noticeable that all these ferns are remarkably difficult to cultivate, abundantly and readily as they grow in a natural state. All attempts to grow *Dipteris* and *Matonia* have failed, while the Gleichenias and the Bracken too are notoriously troublesome to transplant.\n\nVery common and conspicuous too are the *Lygodiums*, known here as \"Ribu-Ribu,\" literally \"thousands,\" from\ntheir numerous leaflets, *L. circinatum* and *L. microphyllum*. So abundant are these ferns climbing over bushes and through grasses, that they are extensively used in decorating ballrooms in the form of twisted ropes of the ferns.\n\n*Anisogonium esculentum* is a very common fern fringing the banks of muddy rivers in dense thickets, and very abundant too is the \"Lamiding\" *Stenochloena palustris* scrambling and climbing over trees and bushes. Both of these last mentioned ferns are eaten as potherbs by the Malays.\n\n*Acrostichum aureum* a big tufted fern occurring in tidal river mud all over the warmer parts of the world is very abundant. It occasionally is to be met with in damp places far away from the sea or any tidal river. In most of these places however I believe that it has merely persisted for many years after the river on whose banks it formerly grow has been silted up and now forms part of the dry land. A large clump still grows in the Economic Gardens at Singapore where the original river on which it doubtless first started its growth has been dry land since any history of it has been known, though Nipah fruits still dug up in the surrounding soil prove that at one time the tides reached this spot. I have also found the *Acrostichum* far inland at the base of Gunong Pantai in Johor, and still further from the sea at Bukit Asahan at the foot of Mount Ophir and over thirty miles from the Coast. Most of the ferns however occur in a more isolated manner, though many are very abundant.\n\nThe richest localities for ferns are the wet densely forested hills at altitudes of from 1000 to 5000 feet but the damp rocky woods of the plains are also very rich. The drier woods are less abundantly supplied, but many species are very characteristic of this kind of locality. Such are the Schizoeas, Lindsayas, Nephrodiums.\n\nEven the sands of the sea-coast produce some species such as *Davallia solida* and *D. elegans*, the *Humatas* and *Schizaea dichotoma*. At high elevations there is a noticeable disappearance of the thin textured ferns such as the Nephrodiums and Lastraeas, which are replaced by the more cori-\naceous leaved xerophytic *Dipteris*, *Matonia*, *Polypodiums*, *Oleandras* and such ferns.\n\nEpiphytic species are very abundant frequently covering the trees, especially at high altitudes, but as it seen in other groups of plants, ferns which in the plants only occur on the upper branches of lofty trees, grow at an altitude of three or four thousand feet quite low down, and not rarely on rocks. Some of these high growing ferns are not at all easy to cultivate at low altitudes, but *Davallia triphylla* which only occurs in a wild state on the topmost boughs of trees a hundred or a hundred and fifty feet high, I have met with on several occasions transplanted, accidentally or intentionally to the base of trees a few feet from the ground and thriving well. This fern was formerly considered so rare that about 20 years ago few herbaria in Europe had a specimen, but as a matter of fact it is by no means a rare plant. Growing as it does only on the inaccessible branches of lofty trees, it could only be obtained by searching for fallen boughs on which it happened to be growing.\n\nTwo of the most curious of our ferns are epiphytic plants remarkable for their rhizomes being modified so as to form nests for ants. They are *Lecanopteres carnosa* and *Pleopeltis sinuosa*. The former which occurs abundantly on trees at 3000 much after the manner of the rubiaceous plant *Myrmecodia*. *Pleopeltis sinuosa* has a thick scaly rhizome hollow inside and also inhabited by ants. It is abundant in Singapore. It is curious that fleshy and succulent as the rhizome of this plant is, it is one of the first epiphytic plants to die during a short dry spell. One would have thought its supply of water in the rhizome would have been sufficient to have prevented this.\n\n**Distribution of Ferns.** As ferns are disseminated by the floating of their dust-like spores on the wind to immense distances it will easily be understood that many of the species have a very wide distribution over the surface of the globe. Ferns indeed are among the first of the higher plants to appear on newly cleared ground, if the soil and climate suit them.\nThe majority of our ferns occur in the Malay islands also, and a large proportion are found in the Mascarene islands, as well as India and Polynesia and South America, which is not the case with the higher flowering plants, few of which except some weeds carried about by human agency have as wide a distribution. Six species even occur in the British Isles, viz., *Trichomanes radicans*, *Hymenophyllum Tunbridgense*, *Pteris aquilina*, *Lastrea Thelypteris* and *Polystichum aculeatum* and *Adiantum Capillus-veneris*.\n\nThere are however about 40 species which are endemic, never having been collected anywhere else except in the peninsula at present.\n\n**Uses of Ferns.**\n\nA good many of the local ferns are used for food in the form of pot herbs in place of spinach, or as sumbuls with curry, but chiefly by natives; for excellent as many of these are, Europeans are not acquainted with their merits and rarely use them. Among the most popular are *Stenochloena palustris* the \"Miding\" or \"Lamiding\" of the Malays, *Anisogonium esculentum* \"Paku Anjing,\" and the water-fern *Ceratopteris thalictroides*, which occurs often abundantly in ditches. Of these ferns the young fronds are collected and boiled.\n\nFrom the stems of Resam, (*Gleichenia linearis*) are made pens, and they are also used for making the walls and partitions of the fishing-stakes.\n\nThe fronds of the common *Pleopeltis Phymatodes*, when dry, exhale a delicious odour of Coumarin, like that of the Tonkin bean. Hence this fern is known as Paku Wangi or scented fern. The fronds are dried and put among clothes, especially I am told by the Eurasian population in order to give them a pleasant perfume.\n\nComparatively few ferns are accredited here with medical properties. The golden brown hairs on the rhizome of *Cileotium Barometz* are used as a styptic for wounds for which they are very suitable, and the rhizomes are sold in the drug-shops.\nunder the name of 'Penawar Jambi.' This vegetable fur is even exported to Europe for the same purpose, being used not only as a styptic but as an antiseptic in planters.\n\nThe fronds of the number of a softer textured ferns are used pounded up as poultices for boils or sores; such are those of *Cyathea Brunonis* (also eaten as a pot herb by Jakuns), and *Phegopteris punctatum*.\n\nThe ashes of *Drynaria quercifolia* fronds are applied to the abdomen in cases of miscarriage.\n\n**GLEICHENIACEAE.**\n\n**GLEICHENIA.**\n\n*Gl. circinata* (Sw.)

Singapore, Bukit Timah on very lofty branches of trees (Ridley 10830). Bishop Hose first pointed out this plant to me some years ago on perfectly inaccessible boughs of a lofty *Shorea* tree 100 feet or more from the ground. There are a number of plants on the boughs, all are quite similar and there are no typical specimens of *Platycerium biforme* on the tree though it is abundant in the surrounding forests. I have only been able to obtain fallen fronds. Mr. C. J. Matthew took specimens to Kew and Mr. Wright notes on them as follows. \"I do not think this can be separated as a distinct species from *Platycerium biforme* Bl, but is a form produced by growing in exposed situations and is worthy of a varietal name. It has also been collected in Borneo by Motley who remarks \"on the highest branches of trees in very exposed places perhaps only [a form] of the long drooping plant growing in damp and shade.\" The plant is certainly most closely allied to *P. biforme* Bl., but I hardly think it can be classed as merely a form or state of that plant. I have seen the ordinary form growing in quite exposed places, on lofty trees and showing no variation. The variety with its short stiff erect fronds, has a most curious appearance, and really looks more distinct from the typical form than any other *Platycerium* I have seen. I note however that\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\nin *P. biforme* the young branched fronds when first protruded point directly upwards and then first spread out horizontally, then deflex.

It is named by Mr. Matthew.\nSome Visits to Batam Island.\n\nC. Boden Kloss, F.Z.S.\n\nPulo Batam though so close to Singapore and frequently visited by pig-shooters, has never been investigated by a naturalist, so perhaps the following extracts from journals\u2014though of trivial happenings as must necessarily be the case where the fauna of small islands is concerned\u2014kept during two short visits I paid to it to collect animals may be of interest.\n\nThis island is 9 miles distant from Singapore, about 15 miles long and 10 miles broad. The northern side is indented and elsewhere it is closely surrounded by other islands. There are hills in the interior covered with jungle, where large outcrops of quartz occur and the boulders are a quartz grit. Much of the low land which has at one time been cleared is swampy or sandy and very poor but where red laterite soil occurs pineapples flourish under the cultivation of Chinese and Bugis settlers. Many young getah trees (Dichopsis sp.) are found in the forests where roam a tribe of Proto-Malays still little affected by outside influences.\n\nMy first visit was paid in September 1905. I left Singapore in a 10-ton cutter-yacht at 11 a.m., got caught in a squall off Pulo Sambu in the afternoon, ran on to a sand-bank at low tide later on but poled off, and anchored off a kampong at the head of Senimba Bay at 5.30 p.m. The upper part of the bay is very shoal and at low water wide mud-flats are exposed all round. I collected some interesting small sponges of bright colours on them. There were seven houses in the kampong and others building further along the shore.\n\nAfter getting the baggage landed next morning we found a deserted Chinese shop behind the village. This we broke open and throwing all the rubbish it contained into a side compartment, I set up my bed, table and chair in the centre room while the boy fixed up his kitchen and sleeping place.\nin a third. There was a hole of good drinking water at hand and a bathing well a little farther off so we felt very comfortable.\n\nA row of wooded hills ran south-easterly towards the centre of the island, a river debouched at the head of the bay and across the water a couple of miles away were the slopes of a long peninsula.\n\nAs I sat talking to the natives in the doorway of my house in the afternoon we saw the eyes of a large crocodile above the calm water about 140 yards away and I was asked to shoot it but refused since my gun was only sighted to 100 yards. However, being pressed, I took a very full sight and fired from my chair; there was a furious turmoil and the reptile disappeared. The natives said it was hit, and indeed three or four days later we found it in the mangroves with its brains flicked out\u2014a 13-footer. When afterwards invited to repeat the performance I was not to be tempted\u2014it was a case of letting well alone.\n\nAt 3 p.m. I went out with a parang and found a path going up the hills; cleared it and set 3 dozen traps. Coming back found a pair of \"tupai tanah\" (*Tupaia ferruginea bata-mana* sp. nov.) just caught and saw several small pigs. Skinned tupaia and after dinner went along the shore for pig but saw none.\n\n\"16th. Set off at 5.30 a.m. to examine the traps which contained a number of rats (*Mus lingensis*) and some tupaia, all much ant-eaten. Found this hill jungle practically lifeless as the forest was poor being without fruit trees, but got a species of civet cat (*Arctogalidia simplex*) which was a valuable prize, and a horn-bill\u2014the \"burong klinking\" (*Anthracoceros convexus*). Skinned till 5.30 and then reset traps. Lent the gun in the evening to a man who wanted to try for pigs in his plantation.\n\n\"17th. No pig seen by the natives. Very little in traps so brought some away and set them lower down amongst coconuts. Got a pair of horn-bills and some squirrels (*Sciurus vittatus*) with the .410 gun amongst the palms; both these are numerous near the village and horn-bill steak is\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\nvery good. Some men went to set \"jerats\" for napu and borrowed the gun in order to try for lotong and krawar (Ratufa sp.) and coming down myself from setting traps without it I saw a large bearded pig!\n\n\"18th. Some fresh rats from the coconuts: one appears to be Mus jarak and the other rather like Mus griseiventris of Johor. Went to the Bugis plantations inland to the S.W. of the range. They are on poor flat land and consist of pines, bananas and tapioca: the forest beyond, which was swampy and largely composed of Melaleuca trees, was quite empty. The napu-trappers had no luck.\n\n\"19th. A couple of small concolorous rats from the coconuts. Away to another patch of jungle beyond the gardens but was disappointed as it was merely a small clump with swamp on the far side. A boy brought some \"tikus padi\" caught in his house. In afternoon went along foot of hills after pig: saw monkeys only but couldn't get near as they went to ground at once, which makes me think they were \"berohs.\" 25 skins to date.\n\n\"20th. Set off for the distant jungle beyond the hills and almost immediately got a \"klabu\" in the mangroves near the house\u2014a female cristata, weight 11 lbs. Had much trouble getting through secondary growth and \"resam\" fern but finally entered the forest and found a path running along a deep gully where a Didymocarpus with violet flowers was growing amongst the rocks. Saw a few common birds but no animals, except another lotong which I got. Found a better way home where two napus were awaiting me, both very large and bright with clear orange necks. Set traps and waited again for pig.\n\n\"21st. Heavy rain all morning so stopped in and skinned the napus. Went out later along the ridge of the hills but got nothing. The view of land and water, north and west was very fine but could see very little jungle in the interior.\n\n\"22nd. Off to the far jungle where I saw absolutely nothing but think I heard the cry of a Ratufa. The few traps out had been interfered with by a pig. 39 animal skins.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 50, 1908.\n\u201c23rd. Hired a large leaky boat and paddled and sailed to Pulo Sambu where we found a launch going to Singapore which gave us a lift: arrived home 9 p.m.\u201d\n\nMy second visit to Batam was the outcome of a desire to collect on Bulang Peak. I left Singapore on March 18th 1906. I had a Malay prau on this occasion which didn\u2019t sail anything like as well as the cutter and we had to do a lot of rowing, particularly amongst the tide-rips behind Pulo Sambu. However we got to Pulo Boyan, where the Controleur is stationed, at seven o\u2019clock and anchored in the strong tide of the Batu Hadji Straits for the night.\n\nI found that the Controleur, who was newly appointed, could give me no information about Bulang but he courteously offered me the services of a constable for the trip which I refused as a useless encumbrance. There was a strong tide against us and no wind all the morning so we passed the time in filling our water-jars from a well on Bulang, as there is no water on the small island, and in the afternoon when the tide slackened we made sail again, reaching at night-fall the kampong where I had hoped to put up. It was in ruins and had evidently been deserted for a long time but I was less disappointed, in that next morning when I made a trip to the Peak I found the way thither to be through swamps while the hill itself had been cleared except on the top, and there was no sign of animal life anywhere. So we sailed back again looking for a place to stop at, but both sides of the strait had been long cleared and were no use for collecting and as I was not provided with any sort of material to form a shelter I decided to put in at Telok Senimba once more\u2014as I was particularly anxious to shoot the bearded pig\u2014and see if I could not add to my former list of specimens, though the locality was not a good one as there was so much cleared land and swamps while the accessible jungle was on hill sides and exceedingly poor. There are no doubt more satisfactory places in the interior but thither one would have to go prepared to camp out.\n\nAfter leaving the sheltered strait we had a lively time against a strong head wind: the prau, with peak dropped,\nwouldn't tack in the rough weather and we had to wear every time but when we got into Senimba Bay it was a nice reach down to the kampong. It was low tide and there was a pig on the mud as we arrived so I paddled off towards him with the gun but lost his track in the mangroves. I had been at the tiller for eight hours without a spell and was painfully sun-burnt.\n\nMy old dwelling place had been pulled down but another Chinaman had built another unsuccessful shop so we appropriated the empty place as before; and then I had a most glorious bath, hitherto having to be content with a dip in the sea of nights which was a great discomfort but this occasion squared it all.\n\n\"22nd. Went along the range at day-break but saw only \"krahs\": cut a path down the far side along the bed of a dry ravine in hopes of finding jungle beyond but there were only stretches of dense scrub. Spent the afternoon on the mud collecting stone-corals and sponges, small kinds of every possible shape and colour. The kampong women catch shell fish in a rather ingenious manner: they search the exposed mud for the hole in which the mollusc lives and then push down a stout piece of the midrib of a rattan palm about twenty inches long and armed at the end with a pair of reversed thorns, and the bivalve lying open at the bottom of the hole closes on the thorns when touched and is drawn up. Got my traps out towards evening and then watched for pig, with no success.\n\n\"23rd. Found a Mus firmus in the traps; this was not in the last collection. A blank morning on the hill except for a specimen of the beautiful rose-breasted pigeon (Ptilopus jambu). Tried a small island across the mud flats where pig were reported but saw none: the mud was fearful stuff to travel through.\n\n\"24th. An absolutely blank morning in the jungle but two napus were brought in and gave something to do. Full moon is said by all hands to be the best time for catching mouse-deer. Lent a gun to a would-be shooter who as usual swore to whole rafts of pigs which never seem to materialise.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 50, 1908.\nFound that the new lantern I intended to do night shooting with had no wick so made some out of a piece of towel and went for a long walk with it on my belt after dinner: no result except that I was nearly choked by the smell of burning paint.\n\n\"25th. A futile morning in the forest: found a collection of old shelters, Malay pondok type, probably made by the \"orang utan\" of Batam. Half a dozen rats, but all badly damaged by ants. Sat out all the evening in a deserted garden and just before dark a medium-sized \"nang-oi\" trotted up. Fired at 60-70 yards and found immediately\u2014not for the first time\u2014I had forgotten to put the rifle lever over. Pig cleared away into lallang warmed up by slugs: nothing else put in an appearance except mosquitoes. My gun-borrowing friend said with truth pigs were to be seen in the clearings if watched for long enough!\n\n\"26th. Nothing in the traps and only monkeys in the jungle. Set some large traps for musang and afterwards watched for pig. Went for a walk with bulls-eye after dinner but saw nothing.\n\n\"27th. Only two specimens in the traps: had to shoot squirrels to make work. The pig-shooter returned his gun; says he has sat up for three nights without seeing anything. A large trap caught a tortoise (Cyclemys platynota) later in the day. No luck with the pigs again. Found a large centipede in my mosquito net which should evidently have been taken as a sign that the bed was not safe as in the night a coconut crashed through the roof and landed on my pillow (Memo. always to strip coco-palms before dwelling beneath them).\n\n\"28th. The usual frost in the jungle. A young napu was brought in and another tortoise got into the traps; evidently these reptiles are attracted of the putrid meat which forms the bait. A pig had also been caught but he successfully pulled out.\"\n\nThis sort of thing went on for several days during which I got nothing but monkeys, rats, squirrels and tupaia. Traces of pigs were everywhere, huge tracks some of them, and I\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\ntwice stampeded the animals in dense vegetation but I was never able to catch sight of them and the spring-guns I set were never effective. However I got a new rat in some beach forest, a very beautiful specimen of the *jerdoni* type which made me feel glad I had come to the island again.\n\nOne afternoon I went up the river which after some distance turned completely on itself and ran south. It was entirely mangrove bordered, though once or twice there were glimpses of old clearings. A number of small side streams were probably only drainage of the swamp. We landed on an isolated hill where were paths and found some old \"jerats\" for mouse-deer. The jungle trees were nearly all of a bark-shedding kind but I saw a quantity of the red stemmed palm (*Cyrtostachys* sp.) and collected some orchids\u2014*Grammatophyllums* being plentiful on the mangroves.\n\nAs I appeared to have exhausted the district after having made 49 mammal skins, many of the species reported apparently not occurring there, on April 3rd we loaded the prau and rowed down the bay to its head where we got a slight breeze. Outside a strong ebb set us to the eastward but as we neared Singapore Island we met the flood which carried us into the harbour in time to get everything home before night.\n\nI obtained thirteen species of mammals during the two visits and observed two others, while nine more were reported to exist. Thus Batam is by no means exhausted: for if they really occur, the determination of the reported *Presbytes*, *M. nemestrina*, *Paradoxurus*, *Sciuropterus* and *Ratufa* will be interesting, but to obtain this it would probably be necessary to camp in the middle of the island where good jungle may still exist.\n\n**Mammals of Batam.**\n\n1. *Presbytes cristata* (Raffles) is fairly common in small herbs both in forest and mangroves. It is known to the natives by the name of \"Klabu.\"\n\n2. *Presbytes species*. A \"Kaka\" with a white breast was reported to occur. If this is a fact I am inclined to\nthink it will be the *P. cana*, Miller, of Pulo Kundur and E. Sumatra rather than *P. rhionis*, Miller, of Bintang Island. These are local forms of *P. femoralis* which, though found in the Peninsula and Sumatra, does not occur on the islands of the Rio-Lingga Archipelago.\n\n3. *Macaca nemestrina*, Linn. The \"beroh\" was said to occur but has not yet been taken in the Archipelago.\n\n4. *M. fascicularis*, (Raffles). The \"krah\" is common everywhere.\n\n5. *Cynopterus montanoi*, Robin. Bats, apparently of this species, were fairly common and were the only kind I obtained. Malay nama \"klawar.\"\n\n6. *Galeopithecus volans*, Linn. The \"kubong\" was said to occur.\n\n7. *Tupaia ferruginea batamana*, Lyon. This new subspecies of the \"tupai tanah\" was exceedingly common. Externally it only differs from *T. ferruginea*, Raffles, in its slightly greyer tail. It is easily separated however by its longer and wider skull.\n\n8. *Arctogalidia simplex*, Miller. This is the Archipelago form. A specimen, the third known, was shot early one morning while it was running along the branch of a high tree. As the people called it a \"musang\" which they said was common I presume that\n\n9. *Paradoxurus hermaphroditus*, Pallus, or an allied form occurs.\n\n10. *Mus concolor*, Blyth was taken in the Kampongs where it was not uncommon.\n\n11. *Mus firmus*, Miller, is the Sumatran form of the Peninsula *M. validus*, Miller. I have never taken these except on the banks of fresh water streams.\n\n12. *Mus lingensis*, Miller. The Sumatran form of *Mus surifer*, Miller. A dry jungle rat and exceedingly common. It seems to begin feeding at early twilight.\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\nas traps specimens are always more damaged by ants than any other kind.\n\n13. *Mus sp.* near *rattus*. The rats provisionally grouped under this heading are most perplexing. They fall readily into two groups which handle in the flesh as extremely distinct. The one division, almost black above with whitish bellies, are finely built animals with very pointed noses and closely resemble *M. jarak*, Bonhote, from Johore. The others with greyish bellies and backs rather like *M. norvegicus* are coarsely built and muzzled and somewhat approximate to *M. griseiventer*, Bonh., of Johore. All these were taken in swampy ground near the sea as was *Mus jarak* which I found only amongst mangroves. *Mus griseiventer* however is a Kampong rat.\n\n14. *Mus batamanus*, Lyon. This new species is of the *jerdoni* type. It is a very beautiful shaped rat and the only specimen I obtained was captured in damp littoral forest. Swampy ground seems the habitat of all this group.\n\n15. *Mus musculus*, Linn. Some specimens of the \"tikus padi\" were brought me by a Bugis boy who had captured them in his house.\n\n16. *Sciuropterus*, sp. Reported; possibly the *am\u0153nus*, Miller of Kundur Island.\n\n17. *Petaurista*, sp. The \"kubin\" was said to occur.\n\n18. *Ratufa*, sp. Reported. A yellow type, probably near *R. insignis*, Miller, of Pulo Sugi.\n\n19. *Sciurus vittatus*, Raffles. Exceedingly common in the coco-nuts where it was very destructive. Cannot be distinguished in any way from Sumatran and Peninsula forms.\n\n20. *Sciurus tenuis*, Raffles. Reported as very rare. I only know of one specimen from the Archipelago, taken on Lingga Island.\n\n*R. A. Soc., No. 50, 1903.*\n21. *Sus rhionis*, Miller. Observed. This is the \"babi bakau\" of the natives and is common everywhere. It is the island form of *S. vittatus*.\n\n22. *Sus oi*, Miller. Observed. The \"nang-oi\" is plentiful but to a solitary collector pigs are difficult to obtain. Generally one is only aware of their presence by a rush through the undergrowth and distant snorts and unless one is lucky in meeting them in the open they rarely figure in collections. The \"nang-oi\" does great damage to the pineapple plantations and is said to be far less timid than other pigs: in fact the natives reported that boars often merely grunted when they tried to scare them away. They are afraid to shoot it with their ineffective ammunition as it charges when wounded. It ranges from Batam to Banka and throughout the swamp of E. Sumatra.\n\n23. *Tragulus kanchil*, sp. A \"pelandoc\" is said to occur.\n\n24. *Tragulus javanicus perflavus*, Miller. This new species is a strongly marked form having very bright pelage and a pure orange neck entirely free from black shading. I have it also from Pulo Galang and it has been taken since on Bulang. It affords a particularly good illustration of local variation as *T. formosus*, Miller of Bintang Island, only five miles away, is exceedingly dark with a collar strongly washed with black.\n\nThus the mammal fauna of Batam is Sumatran and not Peninsular for the above definitely identified species *Mus concolor* and *Cynopterus montanoi* alone are from the Peninsula only. On the other hand, *Mus lingensis*, *M. firmus* and *Sus oi* are known from the Sumatra and the Rio-Lingga Archipelago only. *Arctogalidia simplex*, *Sus rhionis* and *Tragulus perflavus* are found elsewhere only in the Archipelago while *Tupaia ferruginea balamana* and *Mus batamanus* are so far known from Batam alone.\n\nI am inclined to think that Batam, Bulang, Rempang and Galang form a small group which faunistically is more nearly related to the islands to the westward than to Bintang.\non the east, though Pulo Sauh forms a stepping stone to the latter which is only five miles away. Bintang, however, when it is fully investigated will prove to be by far the most interesting island of the whole archipelago. A bank of less than 20 fathoms connects all these islands with both Sumatra and the Peninsula, but the 10 fathom contour lines break them up into various groups of which that above noted is one of the largest.\n\nI have no notes of value about birds for they were scarce and of common species and I soon left off shooting them.\n\nSmall collections of reptiles and insects were made but they contained nothing remarkable.\n\nI preserved a few plants during my visits and two of them, which were new, have lately been described by Mr. H. N. Ridley, viz.\u2014Neckia Klossii and Didymocarpus battamensis.\\(^1\\) The latter is interesting since it grows at sea-level while I believe that the habitat of the Didymocarpi, in this locality at least, is at some altitude.\n\nA few notes on the inhabitants of Batam are given elsewhere in this Journal.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) J. S. B. R. A. S. No. 49.\nSome Ethnological Notes.\n\nC. Boden Kloss, F.R.A.I.\n\nIn the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute Vol. XXXVII., Mr. F. W. Knocker in the course of some notes on the aborigines of Sungei Ujong\u2014the Orang Belanas\u2014relates that they tell in respect of the Sakais, how \"the parents plant a parang in the fore-arm of the young, both male and female, projecting a few inches beyond the elbow. The flesh grows round it and it eventually become part of the fore-limb. In after life this limb weapon is used to clear the jungle and not for hostile purposes.\"\n\nI am able to go one better than this. When living in Johore, it was my practice when travelling in the jungle to endeavour to ascertain whether there were current any traditions of the existence of the orang utan (Simia satyrus) in that part of the peninsula. The native name for this great ape is \"mawas.\" In the swampy country south of Gunong Pulai I found that the name was known and the people of the locality told me tales of its possessor. The information was interesting but not quite what I then wanted. The Orang Mawas were a kind of devil-men who lived in the swamps where their foot-prints might sometimes be seen. Their feet were turned backwards and, with sharp parangs which grew from their elbows like spurs, they killed any human beings they met and afterwards devoured the bodies.\n\nNothing discouraged I continued my enquiries elsewhere and learned that the Jakuns of the Endau Sembrong were also acquainted with a strange beast that seemed to be of the kind I was after. This was a huge red hairy man who lived in the trees and was called tuhu. I felt I was on the right track at last, but unfortunately the story went on to the effect that the tuhu spoke Chinese to a Chinaman when it met him in the jungle, Malay to a Malay, and the Jakun dialect to a Jakun!\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 50, 1903.\nThe head-men of the Belanas are given as 1, Batin; 2, Jinang; 3, Jukrah\u2014the usual titles among the southern inland tribes. I find that a variant of the latter also occurs among the Proto-Malays of the Kallang estuary in Singapore, a fact which Messrs. Skeat and Ridley failed to elect during their short visit thither (J. S. B. R. A. S. No. 33).\n\nThese enquirers state that the head-men of the Kampong they visited were 1, Jinang; 2, Batin. I further find in the neighbourhood one Kampong administered by 1, Batin; 2, Dukrah: and another under 1, Penghulu; 2, Jinang. At Telok Senimba, Pulo Batam, a dozen miles away, the people who are a branch of the \u201cOrang Sabimba\u201d referred to by Logan (Journal of the India Archipelago Vol. I.) have 1, Penghulu; 2, Batin.\n\nThe communities of the Kallang River have evidently been drawn from various sources and some guidance may be afforded by these titles as to their derivation.\n\nAmongst these primitive tribes the title of Batin extends throughout their range from the farthest north of Biliton, and in the islands appears to be the only one except where they have come under the influence of the ruling Malays, in which cases a Malay has often been appointed as Penghulu.\n\nIn the Peninsula however there are amongst themselves officials subordinate to the Batin known as Jinang and Jukrah. Where (according to Logan and others) a Malay has been appointed to supervise them he also is called, possibly because of his functions, Jinang, and it is needless to say that in these cases the title would occasionally become the superior one. This might account for the reversed \u201cTable of Precedency\u201d noted by Messrs. Ridley and Skeat, as Kampong Roko is a small village hedged in by dominant Malays. The anomaly of Penghulu and Jinang noticed by myself in another Kampong I can only account for by supposing that long ago the title of Batin dropped out of use.\n\nThe word bidoh, boat (also the name of a stream in Singapore) given as a Non-Malay expression, is in common use amongst the Malays of the west coast of Borneo.\nMessrs. Skeat and Ridley suggest that \"the Sea-gypsies of Singapore owe their origin largely from 'Sakai' hill-tribes of the Rio-Lingga Archipelago\" and class the Belandas as \"Sakai\" also: surely this is a slip and should be Jakun or Proto-Malayan or some other equivalent of these!\n\nIt is regrettable that all those English writers who have dealt so interestingly with the primitive people should be restricted in experience to the Peninsula for the Jakuns are only the mainland representatives\u2014and probably least pure\u2014of that large family that is spread throughout a great part of Eastern Sumatra and the islands adjacent. Such, for instance, are the Orang Akit of Bengkalis and Rupat Islands, the Palong of the upper tributaries of the Siak River, the Mantong and many others of the Rio-Lingga Archipelago, the Orang Gunong of Banka and the Sika of Biliton. The Kubus and Lubus of the interior of Sumatra also appear to be members of the same family.\n\nTo Journal 41 of the Society Dr. W. L. Abbott contributes a note on \"Human Images among the Orang Man-long.\"\n\nAccording to an old inhabitant of a Kampong at Tanjong Ru, an Oorang Laut by descent\u2014though he would never admit himself to be other than a pure Orang Malayu\u2014these images are called \"Tukar Ganti\" and, in common with the \"Kapal Hantu\" and \"Rumah Sakit,\" are constructed, to his knowledge, by all the inhabitants of the Rhio Archipelago and of the creeks round Singapore in times of sickness. When the Tukar Ganti is completed the \"penyakit\" (sickness) is induced to enter it and it is then taken away to the jungle or some distant spot and there left. Further, all these objects\u2014and this was unknown to me and perhaps is so to others\u2014are used for prophylaxis as well as cure. A current instance was related.\n\n\"Ten days ago the village pawang came to the people, 'I see the evil spirits,' said he, 'the hantus are gathering thickly to afflict the Kampong. Now if we want to escape their machinations every house must contribute 40 cents so that a large vessel may be built into which the hantus will\nenter and can then be sent away to sea.' On the day it is sent off the pawang's house will be under a *pantang* (tabu) to Europeans and all strangers.\"\n\nMy acquaintance also said that once these objects pass from the charge of their makers their superstitious attributes end and no one who takes possession of them is affected in any way. He observed that Europeans called his people idiots for practising such ceremonies. \"But,\" I asked, \"what does the Imam say?\" \"Oh he laughs at us or is angry and says that we are idiots too, for such *hantus* don't exist and such practices are not compatible with Islamism. But our pawang tells us otherwise and as it is a thing we have always done we shall continue to do so.\"\n\nMention has been made of the Orang Senimba (Sambimba). They are the people of whom Logan (Jour. Ind. Arch. Vol. I. p. 295) records that a portion were transferred from Batam Island to Johore and settled on the Tebrau River. In Johore all trace of them as a distinct tribe has now disappeared and the names seems forgotten also. Such also I found to be the case with the Biduanda Kallang settled once on the Pulai River. Nevertheless, all the creeks of the Old Straits and of the Johore River estuary are occupied by people who, although now Islamised, are still primitive in habits and appearance and quite distinct from the dominant Orang Malayu by whom they have been absorbed.\n\nThese are the people once known as Orang Seletar (J. I. A. Vol. I.) and they, with all the above, belong to the Sea-Jakun, or Orang Laut, branch of the Proto-Malays. Except for a small party on the Sungei Masai, merely brought down by a Chinaman to cut fire-wood, I could ascertain no traces of the inland division south of a line drawn between the Batu Pahat and Sedili Rivers. In this latitude they are to be found on the Lenggiu and Sayong streams, the head waters of the Johore. In this connection the cropping up of the parong legend given above is interesting as it shows that the state of affairs was other in the past.\n\nThe remaining Orang Senimba live on the shores of Senimba Bay, behind Pulo Sambu\u2014though Logan speaks of\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\nthem as essentially a forest people\u2014and do a little fishing, cultivating and fire-wood cutting. They are now Mohammedans which is to say that they have lost all ethnographical individuality.\n\nBut in the interior of Batam still exist an almost unspoilt people who, although the island is so small and they are nomadic, never come down to the sea. These are evidently Logan\u2019s \u201cOrang Muka Kuning\u201d (for his other tribe the Treng-Bubong\u201d appear to have shared the fate of the Sabimba) although the name seems unknown to the shore people. I have not seen them personally, for living in temporary shelters and wandering about, they are not easily met with during a short visit but it was stated that they are less than a hundred in number. They trade a little jungle produce occasionally and wear bark chawats when they possess no cotton garments.\n\nThe most interesting fact in connection with them is that they still use the sumpitan and ipoh poison. They do not themselves manufacture the weapon but use one of a Borneo pattern obtained by trading. My informants assured me that though the poisoned darts were effective against wild animals yet they would never kill a fowl.\n\nA similar tribe occupies the interior of Pulo Galang where a Belgian Planting Company has recently had some communication with them.\n\nAs these are probably the only island tribes who have maintained practically uncorrupted their paganism and their isolation, speedy investigation is most desirable.\nThe White-Handed Gibbon.\n\nSo far as I am aware the white-handed gibbon (*Hylobates lar*) has been regarded as an animal restricted in range to the mainland of Asia, inhabiting there the Tenasserim Province and the Malay Peninsula only. I therefore wish to place on record its occurrence in the swampy regions of East Sumatra, where it has been met with in large numbers by Dr. W. L. Abbott and myself, particularly in the Siak and Indragiri districts.\n\nIt occurs there, as elsewhere, in the biscuit-coloured, in brown and in sooty pelage, and as far as my observations are worth anything it is impossible to consider these varieties as colour races in any way. I have several times noted, though this does not seem to be general, dark females with pale infants and vice versa and have also shot pie-bald adults with the colours so distributed that it would be impossible to say whether they are dark-furred individuals becoming pale or pale becoming dark. As however the pale form is comparatively scarce it is to be inferred that the latter metamorphosis is what is happening and that the light specimens are born so.\n\nThe statement that gibbons are monogamous is one that I thoroughly agree with: whether however they divorce each other and take new partners from time to time we have yet to learn. The point is interesting since such an able reasoner as Westermarck (*The Origin of Human Marriage*) has come to the conclusion that the marriages of mankind are an inheritance from some ape-like progenitor.\n\nI do not ever remember meeting Malayan gibbons in parties of more than five at a time, but the most usual numbers are four or less. A small district may often contain a large number of apes but the little groups seem to live quite independently of each other and do not combine. These parties consist of two parents and their off-spring of different\nbirths, but as a rule it seems that about the time the third infant appears the eldest is sufficiently adult to take a partner with whom it starts life on its own account.\n\nIt is thus rather interesting to note that while the lower monkeys of nearly all species go about in bands\u2014*Presbytes obscurus* is inclined to pair, however\u2014in the case of the man-like apes (with the exception of the chimpanzee, perhaps the most intelligent of them all; the siamang and the Indian hoolock) the social unit is the family. This is, by many authorities, held to have been the state of primitive man before he became intellectual enough to recognise the advantages derived from union.\n\nWhile their inactive habits compelled the gorilla and orang and possibly primitive man to be practically solitary as otherwise they would have exhausted their food supplies, this is not the case with the gibbon the most agile of all the apes. I hope to contribute to a forth-coming journal some notes on the relationship between the gibbon's structure and its habits.\n\nC. B.

O. Winstedt.\n\nThis tale is not to be confused with that rollicking farce Musang Berjanggut, \"The Bearded Civet-Cat;\" it is merely a beast fable of the Aesop type. The tale and language is so simple that a literal translation would be tiresome. The following is the gist of it. Some villagers moved from their kampong up to a hill rice-clearing and left behind them a hen and two chicken which they could not catch. One day hen and chicken were looking for food in the scrub, when the chicken wandered away from the hen and met a huge civet-cat. Said the civet-cat, \"How would you like me for a stepfather, you fatherless little chicks? Tell me where your mother roosts to-night and I will come and woo her.\" \"We all sleep at the end of the threshold to-night,\" chirped the chicken. \"All right I'll come and meet your mother,\" said civet-cat. So the chicken went back to the hen and the elder chicken chirped all about their meeting with civet-cat and how civet-cat was coming to visit them at 'the end of the threshold' that very night. \"Oh you very naughty tell-tale chicken\" clacked the hen and removed with them to a cross-beam under the roof. And civet prowled in vain that night all round the threshold. The next morning civet-cat met the chicken again and scolded them for their deceit. \"All mother's fault\" chirped the chicken, \"she was angry with us for telling you her roosting-place and moved to the roof beam.\" \"Oh,\" said civet-cat, \"well, where does your mother roost to-night; I am longing to meet her.\" \"On the cross-beam under the roof\" chirped the chicken. When they returned to their mother, she asked where they had been and they told the whole story. Then the hen was very angry and beat them for telling civet-cat of the roosting-place and removed and slept on the ridge-pole. In vain civet-cat searched that\nnight also. Next morning the bigger chicken said to the tiny chick, \"Come, let us go and tell civet-cat all about it or he'll be angry with us just because of mother's whims.\" So they set off and found civet-cat furious but appeased him by protesting their innocence and telling him of their new roosting-place on the roof-tree; and they vowed not to tell their whimsical mother that they had met him or had told him of her roosting-place. Then that night civet-cat crept up on the roof-tree and devoured the poor hen and her silly chicken.\n\nCherita Pa Musang.\n\nSa-b\u00ebrmula, maka konon ada-lah orang p\u00ebladang tiga b\u00ebranak b\u00ebrpindah dari kampong-nya diam di-ladang, habis-lah di-bawa-nya d\u00ebngan ayam itek-nya s\u00ebmua sa-kali; t\u00ebrtinggal-lah tiga ekur ayam-nya sa-ekur ibu-nya dua ekur anak-nya baharu sa-b\u00ebsar t\u00ebkukur b\u00ebtina tiada-lah dapat ditangkap oleh p\u00ebladang itu karna t\u00ebrlalu amat liar-nya.

GEORGE MAXWELL.\n\nIt was in the fifth voyage of Sindbad the Sailor, after the shipwreck caused by the bereaved and vengeful roc, that he found himself upon an island where he met \"an old man, 'a comely person, who was clad from the waist downwards 'with a covering made of the leaves of trees.\" The old man was sitting by the side of the stream sighing; and in answer to Sindbad's questions made signs, by dumb show, that he wished to be carried across the stream to some fruit trees on the further side. Sindbad, in pity, took him up on his shoulders, whereupon the old man twisted his legs \"which were like the hide of a buffaloe in blackness and roughness\" round Sindbad's neck. \"I was frightened at him,\" \"Sindbad's narrative continues \"and desired to throw him down \"from my shoulders; but he pressed upon my neck with his \"feet, and squeezed my throat, so that the world became black \"before my face, and I was unconscious of my existence, fall- \"ing upon the ground in a fit like one dead. He then raised \"his legs, and beat me upon my back and my shoulders and \"I suffered violent pain; wherefore I rose with him. He still \"kept his seat upon my shoulders, and I had become fatigued \"with bearing him; and he made a sign to me that I should \"go in among the trees, to the best of the fruits. When I \"disobeyed him, he inflicted upon me, with his feet, blows \"more violent than those of whips; and he ceased not to direct \"me with his hands to every place to which he desired to go, \"and to that place I went with him. If I loitered, or went \"leisurely, he beat me; and I was as a captive to him. We \"went into the midst of the island, among the trees, and he \"descended not from my shoulders by night nor by day; when \"he desired to sleep, he would wind his legs round my neck, \"and sleep a little, and then he would arise and beat me,\n\"whereupon I would arise with him quickly, unable to disobey\n\"him, by reason of the severity of that which I suffered from\n\"him.\"* It will be remembered that eventually, after many\ndays of beatings and ill treatment, Sindbad got rid of the old\nman by making him intoxicated with fermented grape juice,\nand then beating out his brains with a stone.\n\nAfter his escape Sindbad wandered for some days upon\nthe island until he met some merchants who, when they had\nheard his story, told him who it was that he encountered.\n\"This man\" they told him \"who rode upon thy shoulders is\ncalled the Old Man of the Sea, and no one ever was beneath\nhis limbs and escaped from him excepting thee.\"\n\nThe whole of Sindbad's personal narrative points to his\nadventure having been with an orang utan (simia satyrus):\nthe difficulty, the only difficulty, but the whole difficulty, is\nthe name ascribed to his persecutor by the people whom he\nmet after his escape. Hole, in his commentary, suggested\nthat the \"Old Man\" was an orang utan, but the qualifying\nwords \"of the Sea\" so baffled him that he was prepared to\nconsider them a mistake. \"I would willingly suppose\" he\nwrote, \"the phrase 'of the sea' to be an addition of the trans-\nlator, not countenanced by the original: or that it was\napplied to Es-Sindbad's persecutor merely on account of his\ninsular abode, or usual appearance by the sea side. If\neither of these conjectures be allowed we may pronounce\nhim, without any hesitation to be an orang outan.\" Hole\nthen goes on to give his reasons for his opinion.\n\nLane agreed with Hole that the \"Old Man\" was an\norang utan, and supported the theory that the words \"of the\nsea\" merely denoted the insular abode.\n\nBurton scoffed at the idea: \"the inevitable orang-utan\"\nwas his jeering comment. But his own suggestion does not\nseem worthy of much support. The story is, he says \"a\njocose exaggeration of a custom prevailing in parts of Asia\nand especially in the African interior where the tsetse fly\nprevents the breeding of burden-beasts . . . . . In\n\n* Lane's translation.\n\"Central Africa the kinglet rides on a slave, and on cere-\n\"monious occasion mounts his Prime Minister.\" The weak-\nness of the connection of ideas is however apparent. The\ncustom of one man being carried by another does not convey\nthe impression of the unnatural, clinging, unshakeable,\ncreature with which Sindbad was saddled. For an ex-\nplanation of the expression \"of the Sea\" Burton had\nrecourse to the classics. \"The classicists,\" he wrote \"of\ncourse, find the Shaykh of the Sea in the Tritons and\nNereus, and Bochart (Hieroi ii 858, 880) notices the home\naquaticus, Senex Judaeus and Senex Marinus.\"\n\nBut he has made no attempt to show any connection of\nideas between the Man-riding Man and the Water-Man. The\nfive arguments which Hole adduces in favour of the orang\nutan theory may be briefly enumerated as follows:\u2014\n\n1. The old man never speaks, but expresses his wishes\nby signs.\n\n2. He apparently lives solely on fruit.\n\n3. Though his face is like that of a human being, the\nhide of his legs is like that of an animal.\n\n4. The \"pressing,\" the \"squeezing\" the \"winding\" of\nthe legs.\u2014[Any one who has kept a pet orang utan, wah-\nwah (Hylobates lar) or siamang (H. syndactylus) as a pet\nknows the almost wild despair with which it clings to its\nmaster, as if it would suffer itself to be torn to pieces rather\nthan be removed.]\n\n5. The well known partiality of apes and monkeys to\nintoxicants, and the extreme quickness with which they be-\ncome intoxicated.\n\nA sixth point, which was probably unknown to Hole, but\nto which considerable weight may be attached is that stories\nsimilar to Sindbad's story are told to his day of the orang\nutan by the Dyaks. Hugh Clifford's \"Story of Chaling, the\nDyak\" is very like the adventure of Sindbad. Chaling, it\nwill be remembered, was carried off by a female orang utan to\nits platform on a forest tree, and for many days was unable to\neffect his escape.\n\nR. A. Soc. No. 60, 1908.\nThe principal objection to the orang utan theory is that Simia satyrus is red, and not black. But in explanation of this I would suggest that there has been some confusion between Simia satyrus, which is red, and hylobates lar which is black. *At the risk being considered fanciful, I am even prepared to suggest that the white beard, with which some old versions of the Arabian Story and the modern illustrator to Lane's translation have adorned the \"Old Man\" are an embellishment of the white ruff of Hylobates lar. A minor objection is the fact that grapes do not grow in the countries where the orang utan is found. Toddy, however, and other similar intoxicants are well known; and it is not improbable that the words \"grape juice\" were inserted by some copyist.\n\nLet us take it that Sindbad's persecutor was an orang utan. How do we get from orang utan to \"Man of the Sea\"? Simply, I think; through the Malay. \"Man of the Sea\" (orang laut) is a mistake for \"Man of the Forest\" (orang utan).\n\nIt is well known that orang utan has two meanings: it is the name for the ape, and is also the generic name for the aborigines. They are known as orang utan; orang bukit, (men of the hills); or, in the case of the tribes driven inland, orang dalam (men of the interior), or orang darat (men of the land); whilst in contradistinction to the latter, the tribes driven to the coast are known as orang laut (men of the sea).\n\nThus the Sakei are divided into Sakei laut and Sakei darat, in the same way that Dyaks are divided into Sea-Dyaks and Land-Dyaks.\n\n* In the account of Sindbad's adventure in his third voyage, in the Island of Apes, Lane's translation describes the apes as being \"covered with hair like black felt,\" while in the Calcutta edition and Langl\u00e8s' edition they are described as \"red downy creatures.\" I suggest that the mariner who described the animals as red was thinking of the orang utan, and that the other who described them as black was thinking of the wah-wah. A similar confusion seems to have been made in the case of the \"Old Man.\"\n\nJour. Straits Branch,\nIt is easily therefore to make a mistake between a \"man of the sea\" and a \"man of the forest,\" for both are of the same stock; and it is equally easy to make a mistake between the aboriginal and the ape, for both are known by the same name. And this is the mistake that I think has been made. The position may be briefly put thus:\u2014what the merchant said to Sindbad was \"you've met an orang utan:\" what Sindbad has recorded is \"you've met orang laut.\"\n\nIf this is conceded, it would appear that Borneo is the island of the adventure with the \"Old Man,\" (Lane suggested Sumatra, where the orang utan is also found) and that Sindbad's tale and Hugh Clifford's tale are but slightly different versions of the story (founded perhaps on fact) which is told by the Dyaks regarding the gigantic ape that, to this day, is the most typical inhabitant of their forests.\n\nPostscript. I have, since this note was set up in type, come across a mistake which is exactly similar but even more extraordinary. On page 175 of Volume II. of \"Asiatick Researches\" will be found a curious confusion between the Thibetan Yak and the manatel or dugong. Two more dissimilar animals could hardly be imagined; but one is the \"Mountain-Cow\" and the other is the \"Sea-Cow;\" and \"Mountain-Cow\" and \"Sea-Cow\" have been confused in exactly the same way that \"Forest-Man\" and \"Sea-Man\" have (I suggest) been confused.\n\nW. G. M.\nSpada.\n\nOne of the first words that a visitor to Java or Sumatra hears is \"spada.\" It is, in the hotels of the Dutch Colonies, the common call for a servant; a person shouts \"spada\" in the same way that in this Colony he shouts \"boy\" and in the same curious way the servant, wherever he may be, shouts back \"tuan.\" The word is not a native one, and is not used by the natives.\n\nThe derivation usually given of the word is a corruption of two Malay words \"siapa ada\" (is anyone there?). I do not know however whether any one has suggested that the word dates from, and is a survival of, the days of British rule in the island now under the Dutch flag. Such however is probably the case. The use in the Bengal Presidency of the call \"koi hai\" (is anyone there?) is so well known that a civil servant of that Presidency is generally known as \"Qui-hai.\"* I suggest that \"siapa ada\" is merely the translation of \"koi hai\" and that it was introduced by the servants of the Honourable East India Company who had served in Calcutta before they came further east. \"Siapa ada\" certainly is not idiomatic Malay, and would not ordinarily be used by Malays in the sense in which, in this case, \"spada\" is.\n\nProbably it is this very fact, quite as much as the open vowel sounds of the syllables, that have led to its present corrupted and contracted form.\n\nIf my suggestion is correct, two curious facts are worthy of note: first, that in India it is the caller and in the Netherlands Indies it is the person called that is known (in each case\n\n* It has even passed into the French language.\n\nIn the \"Correspondance avec sa famille\" of Victor Jacquemont therre is the following passage (Vol: II. page 308):\n\n\"J'ai vu dans vos gazettes de Calcutta les clameurs de quoihac (sobiquet des Europ\u00e9ens Bengalis de ce cote) sur la chaleur.\"\n\nJour. Straits Branch, R. A. Soc., No. 50, 1908.\nby the alien nation) by the words of the call; and second, that\nthe call survives only in a country that has ceased to be under\nBritish rule, and does not survive (if indeed it ever was\nknown) in the Colony of the Straits Settlements.\n\nW.

In *C. denticollis* this elevation is better developed and takes its origin just from the basal tooth (the whole middle pronotum is also much broader transverse, etc.) The colouration of the upper side of *C. spinicollis* is a little darker and more dusky brownish brassy than in *C. denticollis*; the puncture of the elytra is finer and less distinctly developed.

On splitting it up three or four bats flew out but there being more inside he brought it to me tied up. On taking it to the museum and carefully opening it Dr. Hanitsch and I found no less than twenty-three bats of which four were adult females and nineteen were young ones. One of these was still clinging to the mother and sucking. The joint of bamboo in which these bats were enclosed was a foot in length and the diameter of the hollow inside was 2 inches. The septa at each node were perfect and unbroken, and the only possible entrance was made by a crack on one side which allowed of a narrow slip to be pushed outwards so that a triangular aperture a quarter of an inch across in its widest part appeared in the upper septum.\n\nThrough this very small space all these bats must have crept. The inside of the bamboo was wet and dark coloured and there were some dipterous larvae within.\n\nIn another clump of the same kind of bamboo, two other joints containing young bats of apparently the same kinds were opened. In one joint when opened, it having been felled and left for some days in the sun all the bats were dead and decomposed. They nearly filled the joint and were apparently about thirty in number. In the other several bats had escaped but there were a number of young ones and one half grown. Specimens of these bats were sent to the British Museum where Mr. Oldfield Thomas examined them and found them to be *Tylonycteris pachyurus*, (*Vesperugo pachyurus* Dobson).

RIDLEY.\nThe Labiatae in the Materials for a Flora of the Malay peninsula have been described by Dr. Prain who gives eighteen genera and thirty species of this order as occurring in the Malay peninsula. Like the Compositae the Labiates are very poorly represented all through the rain forest region. They are inhabitants of open country and being all small plants and being dispersed chiefly by the mere sprinkling of their seeds as the wind blows, can neither push their way into our dense forests nor establish themselves there in the thick shade if they did get there. The only forest species indeed that we possess, the Gomphostemmas, have been so far modified for forest life that their fruits are developed into small white pulpy drupes, which can be eaten by birds and so the seeds dispersed. An analogous case among the Rubiaceae with capsular fruit is seen here too in *Hedyotis congesta* belonging to an open country group of capsular seeded weeds in which also the fruit is developed into a small white pulpy berry.\n\nThe species recorded in the Materials are as follows:\n\n*Ocimum sanctum*, L. *O. Basilicum*, L. *O. gratissimum*, L. (and *O. canum* might be added.) *Orthosiphon stamineus*, Benth. *Hyptis brevipes*, Poit. *H. suaveolens*, Poit. *Plectranthus Kunstleri*, Prain! *Coleus atropurpureus*, Benth! *Pogostemon Heyneanus*, Benth! *P.

G. Curtisii, Prain! Cymaria dichotoma, Benth! Acrymia ajugiflora, Prain! Those marked \u201c!\u201d are the only ones which can claim to be really indigenous.\n\nThe Basil, Ocimum and the Mint, Mentha javanica are garden pot herbs which can hardly be said to have established themselves anywhere. The Mint quoted only from Malacca, Griffith, has long been cultivated. It seldom flowers here, and I have never seen it outside a garden plot. Salvia coccinea, Juss. and Orthosiphon stamineus as far as our region is concerned are only to be met with in flower beds. The Orthosiphon \u201cKumis Kuching\u201d of the Malays is however a native of Siam and may be found wild across our borders in the extreme north.\n\nLeonurus nepetifolia, Br. is also a cultivated plant only to be found in gardens.\n\nAnisomeles malabarica, Br. only met with in Penang town suburbs, is obviously an introduction from India probably by Tamils. It was collected in 1822 in Penang by Wallich.\n\nLeonurus sibiricus is brought in and cultivated by Chinese who use it in medicine.\n\nSalvia plebeia, Br. is only recorded from Malacca without collector\u2019s name, probably the specimen was from an introduced plant. Leucas martinicensis, Br. is also an introduction. It has only been obtained by Scortechini in Perak.\n\nNone of these plants have ever established themselves as weeds, and can only be classed as Garden escapes.\n\nThoroughly established here as all over the tropics are the two American Hyptis, H. suaveolens and H. brevipes.\n\nThe rest of the list fall into three groups (1) herbs occurring as weeds only in cleared ground near cultivation, but certainly natives of this area. These are Coleus atropurpureus, Benth., Anisomeles ovata, Br., Lencas zeylanica, Br. and L. lavandulifolia, Sm. and Calamintha gracilis, Benth. This latter I found in some quantity at the foot of the Thaiping hills in open ground. It has otherwise only been found in Java and once in Assam.\n(2). Herbs growing in the jungles and obviously indigenous the *Gomphostemmas*, and I believe *Pogostemon Heyneanus*, Benth. the Indian patchouli.\n\nThe *Pogostemon* is not so far as I am aware cultivated here, but it is possible that it is. I have met with it on stream banks in forests, at Rawang in Selangor (No. 7603 of my collection) and at Taka Tahan on the Tahan River (No. 2031) also in Sarawak at Lundu (No. 1238) and it is in Haviland\u2019s collection from Penkulu Ampat in Sarawak. In the Tahan River locality it was growing near *Colocasia antiquorum* at an old Sakai camping ground, and was probably carried there by the Sakais, but there was nothing to suggest it had been introduced in the other localities. It is known to the Malays as Rumput Ruku, Poko Nijao, Nilam Bukit and Chilam Bukit. It is used as a poultice in cases of headache, rheumatism and boils, and in the form of a decoction is drunk for dropsy. The flowers the colour of which is not given in the Materials are pale violet.\n\n*P. Cablin*, Benth. the commonly cultivated patchouli is described fully in the Materials. Its native home is quite unknown.\n\n*Dysophylla auricularia*, Bl. is undoubtedly wild here, I think. It grows in swampy open ground, edges of rivers, etc.\n\n*Scutellaria discolor*, Benth. was once collected by Scortechini in Perak and is probably wild. I have never seen it.\n\n(3). The third set of indigenous Labiates are all from the limestone rocks of Ipoh and near by. They are *Plectranthus Kunstleri*, Prain., *Paraphlomis rugosa*, Prain. and *Cymaria dichotoma*, Benth., *Acrymia ajugiflora*, Prain. The occurrence of four species of this order out of so small a number of indigenous species on such a limited area as this range of limestone hills is very remarkable.\n\nThus this large order is represented in the Malay peninsula by only 15 species which can be considered to be truly indigenous.\nThe Crackling Moth.\n\nBy H. N. Ridley.\n\nIt is not unfrequent when passing along roads through woods, just after dusk has set in to hear all around a strange crackling sound not very loud but quite distinct and resembling somewhat Chinese crackers heard at a distance. This is produced by a black moth of some size, which seems to be hardly distinct from *Nyctipao hieroglyphica* as figured in Hampson's moths of India, and Moore's Lepidoptera of Ceylon. I do not find any mention of the peculiar behaviour of this insect made anywhere in these works, so I will give some account of it. The moth is three and a half inches across the wings, which are rather longshaped and scolloped along the edges, wings and body are of a deep brown black, above and below and on the upper wing near the tip is a yellow mark something like an 8 but with the loops more oblong and angled and the neck more distinct. In the centre of the upper wing is a faint shadowy eye formed of two rings of black one inside the other, the centre of a slightly paler brown colour than the rest of the wing. On the underside the yellow spot is seen but not so bright in colour, the peacock's eye is invisible and there is another small yellow spot lower down on the upper wing. The body is cylindric black, and the antennae are wiry and black. The insect differs from the figure of the Ceylon form, in Moore's Lepidoptera of Ceylon, in its darker colour and very indistinct eye, which in the Ceylon form has some chestnut red in the centre, (*Argiva hieroglyphica* Pl. 165) but it is perhaps a local form. The insect above described is a male. The females have a white spot on the upper wing.\n\nDuring the day, the moth hides under roots or in crevices of rock where it is quite dark, as do most species of the genus, and if disturbed dashes off to seek another hiding place.\nhave seen it thus in the garden rockery, and in the Bukit Timah forests. It leaves its resting spot about half past six in the evening and betakes itself to an open road or path. Here it flies briskly backwards and forwards, in the shadows, and at such a pace that owing to this and its dark colour making it so invisible, it is very difficult to capture. Often half a dozen or so are dashing about the road at a time and they keep to specially favoured spots, night after night. They do not make any noise when flying about singly, but when two are flying about chasing each other they produce the strange crackling sound described above. Owing to the darkness it is impossible to see how they do it, neither am I sure whether it is effected by a pair or by two males only. I have only caught males. They remain till it is actually quite dark, but then seem to disappear. Neither light nor cow-droppings which are often attractive to moths engage their attention. They keep just out of the light of the road lamps. When by a lucky stroke one is secured in the net, it is usually very quiet and does not flutter about, so that often one does not notice at first that it is trapped, but so fast it flies and so hard one has to strike at it that the insect is very apt to be damaged by the concussion.\n\nIt appears at the end of May. This habit of dashing about the roads and its peculiar crackling noise, are not shared with any other Nyctipaos as far as I know. A larger species with brown wings ornamented with white eyes, is one of our commonest moths and often comes to light. It rests during the day under rocks or banks, or on beams in sheds or houses and though rapid in flight when disturbed, merely dashes from one hiding place to another, and I have never met with it dashing about the road at night in the way that *N. hieroglyphica* does. The latter is abundant in Singapore and I have also met with it in Pahang and other parts of the peninsula.\n\nNothing appears to be known of the life history of this moth.\n\nH. N. RIDLEY.\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\nNew or Rare Malayan Plants.\n\nSeries IV.\n\nBy H. N. Ridley.\n\nIt will be seen by this series of novelties that the knowledge of our flora even of the best known spots is not yet complete. Even in Singapore with its nearly exterminated native flora, still some novelties lurk in the few remaining bits of forest, thus the Stagmount wood produced the beautiful new ginger which was found growing in a spot which I have frequently visited and only a few yards from my usual track. The Randia, the Heritiera and Diospyros described herein I have known for many years, but they have not been described in the Materials and so are now published for the first time.\n\nThe well known furniture wood Katinga from the Siamese borders has long been prized and I obtained leaves and a fruit some years ago from Mr. F. G. Penney, who had a fine collection of furniture made from its wood. A number of young plants were raised in the Botanic Gardens, and I lately obtained specimens shewing parts of the flower from Mr. H. C. Robinson. It proves to be a Murraya allied to the well known Kamuning wood, so much valued for the handles and sheaths of Krises.\n\nThe low-lying forest region of Southern Johore, has produced several interesting novelties, including a remarkable new genus of gingers, but many more curious and interesting plants will be found in this unexplored district when time serves to investigate it. From Sarawak Mr. Hewitt still continues to send many more novelties, and among Sarawak plants I am glad to be able to associate the name of the\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 50, 1908.\nFounder of our Society with the beautiful climber, *Hosea Lobbiana*, the ladder to the moon, (Tanga Bulan) of the Malays. This charming plant abundant in the swamps near Kuching, has been more or less known for a long time. Thomas Lobb while collecting plants for cultivation for Veitch found it and dried a spray of it which is now at Kew, but Lobb does not seem to have troubled to put localities on the tickets of his dried specimens, and when his collections were received at Kew, many were wrongly localised, and this plant was supposed to have come from Penang, and was described as thence by Clarke in the Flora of British India as *Clerodendron Lobbiana*, (the peculiar fruit however prevents it from being a Clerodendron).\n\nMiss North saw it at Kuching and made a drawing of it, which however was not recognized as Lobb\u2019s plant. Bishop Hose brought plants of it into his garden at Kuching, and some years ago gave one to the Botanic Gardens in Singapore where it has been cultivated. It seems of slow growth and not very easy to propagate, so that it has not been found possible as yet to distribute it to other gardens. It is a most attractive plant with its red upper leaves and salmon-orange flowers. A contrast to it is the dwarf *Clerodendron pumilum* from the road banks of Matang mountain in Sarawak, perhaps the smallest of clerodendrons, though with a fairly large tuft of white and pink flowers.\n\n**STERCULIACEAE.**\n\n*Heritiera elata*, n. sp.\n\nA gigantic tree 100 feet tall 2 feet through with strong buttresses, bark grey flaky.

The finest is a conspicuous object by the plant sheds growing close to a still taller *Palaquium bancanum*. The underside of the leaves is covered with a layer of coppery silvery scales circular in outline with numerous irregular teeth on the margin. These scales also occur on the upper surface of the young leaves. The Male flowers are produced in great abundance rosy pink in color. The females seem much scarcer. I have failed to find any on my specimens. The fruit has a much more distinct wing than has *H. littoralis* the common sea shore tree, but it is not sufficiently large to act in dispersing the plant. The fruits indeed simply fall in great quantities beneath the tree and most of them perish after a short time.\n\n**Rutaceae.**\n\n*Murraya caloxylon*, n. sp.\n\nA tree of considerable size the branches covered with a pale flaky bark.

This handsome wood is of light yellow color, ornamented with dark brown streaks and strains, fairly hard in texture and taking a good polish. Mr. F. Penney obtained a considerable quantity of the wood from Siamese territory North of Province Wellesley, from which he had made furniture, boxes, etc., which was very highly valued on account of its beauty. He obtained also leaves and fruit of the tree. For the flowers I am indebted to Mr. H. C. Robinson, who met with it in Upper Perak.\n\nIt differs from other species of the genus in the greater size of the leaves, the conspicuously stalked ovary, and the remarkable fruit which resembles a citron. The rind has a bitter terpentiney flavour, and the comparatively scanty pulp is quite tasteless. The fruit is so entirely different from that of any other species of the genus that the plant might almost be separated generically.\n\n**Melastomaceae.**\n\n*Osbeckia chinensis*, L.\n\nHas been sent by Mr. Fox from Setul in Southern Siam where it was collected by Mohammed Aniff, the\nForeman Gardener of Penang Gardens.

The typical plant is a large stout shrub or small tree common in the open country with flesh colored flowers in dense racemes. The variety *pauciflora* is a tall slender little-branched shrub, with a slender broken up raceme of white or creamy white sweet-scented flowers. It only occurs in dense wet forest and is not found with the common species. Thus the variety occurs in Bukit Timah forest, while *F. racemosa* does not occur at all in Singapore.\n\n*F. Ridleyi*, King and Gamble.\n\nThis is not completely described as the authors had not seen flowers of it. It appears only to have been collected by myself once on the lower slopes of Mount Ophir and also on Bukit Timah in Singapore. The only plant I found in Singapore was growing as an epiphyte on a dead tree at the top of the hill. The tree later fell down and I believe the plant quite perished. Before it did so however, I managed to obtain a cutting and planted it in the Botanic Gardens where it has now developed into\na large branching shrub about 12 or 14 feet tall. It first flowered in 1902, and set fruit. The leaves are dark green shining above, glaucous beneath, obovate with prominent nerves beneath, on the upper surface are scattered roundish elevations, corresponding to glands of a yellowish color beneath. The buds are protected by a white resinous secretion which become, buff yellow when exposed to the air. The flowers are in cymes of four, on short peduncles. Calyx lobes ovate blunt nearly an inch long. Corolla tube thick nearly 2 inches long pale orange green, the lobes oblong obtuse emarginate reflexed, white shaded with green 1 inch long \u00bd inch wide. Stamens long white, anthers oblong rounded pale violet. Style rather thick greenish. Stigma capitate emerald green conic about 3 inches long, ending in the stout style.\n\n*F. auriculata*, Jack.\n\nThis the finest of all the Fagraeas, usually at least starts life as an epiphyte and killing its host becomes a very large branching shrub sometimes as much as 30 feet tall. The branches are straggling and flexuous, and armed with short sharp points on either side of the auricles of the leaves. Most of the descriptions of this plant as taken from herbarium specimens much under-rate the size of the leaves and flowers. There seem to be two forms however in one of which the flowers are much smaller than in the other and commoner forms.\n\nThe flowers during life have the following dimensions. Calyx 3 inches long and 2 inches in diameter. Corolla tube 6 inches long and 3 inches across the mouth, lobes 3 inches across, and \u00bc inch thick. The whole corolla is eight to 12 inches or more across. The stamens are three inches long, the style four inches with an emerald green stigma more than half an inch across.\n\nThe flower opens in the early morning and remains open for two days before falling, or turning yellow. It exhales a coarse rather musky scent. The stamens have\ntheir anthers at first up-curved, but ere long they fall and lie on the lower face of the tube. The stigma is then not fully developed and not half as big as it eventually becomes. The stamens dihisce, and produce a quantity of white pollen when they are in a prone position. The flowers are now visited by the very small *Trigona (Tr ruficornis)*. These hover about the stamens, then settle and gather pollen, rise hover again and resettle. Occasionally they rest on the stigma, and deposit pollen thereon. Usually however the stigma is not developed till the next day, when the pollen is all gone, and if there has been rain, wet and spoilt, for it has no protection. On the second day, the stigma is fully developed, and has attained its full size. I have seen no other insect at the flower, though I watched for hawkmoths for a long time in the evening, none visited it.\n\nThe fruit is six inches long surrounded at the base by the thick green overlapping calyx lobes. These are ellipsoid rounded at the top and elevated in the centre, 3 inches long by 2 inches wide. The fruit is cone-shaped with a blunt top, polished lead-colour. When ripe it dehisces at the top into five lobes, covered with a sweet orange pulp in which the seeds are imbedded. This pulp is evidently derived from the placenta. The fruit often splitting and leaving the placenta erect in the centre and covered with the small seeds imbedded in the pulp. The pulp is sweetish with a strong unpleasant bitter taste and is very attractive to birds and ants. The seeds are irregularly angled, and finely reticulate. The seeds when deposited on a tree trunk germinate and the little plants as they grow emit long olive yellow roots like those of an orchid, which run upwards and downwards on the tree trunk, for a length of 6 or 8 feet or more. The plant branches from the base sending out 2 or more stems. Eventually it appears either to kill the tree or descend to the ground forming a tree of some size. The largest plant in the gardens has layered itself from one of the branches.\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\nF. oblonga, King and Gamble.\n\nThis is incompletely described in the Materials for a Flora of the Malay peninsula, for lack of complete specimens. I would add the following notes to the description. It is an epiphyte with rather flaccid leaves for a Fagraea. The flowers are borne in pairs on axillary peduncles at the ends of the branches. The peduncles are an inch long and rather stout, as are the pedicels \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long. The calyx lobes are ovate blunt \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long. Corolla white, with a straight tube 1 inch long, the lobes \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch long \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch wide oblong obovate with rounded tips. Stamens included, anthers oblong. Style an inch long, with a peltate stigma.\n\nThe plant occurs at the Tea Gardens and the Cottage on the Thaiping Hills and I have also found it at the Semangkok Pass in Selangor (No. 12069 of my collection).\n\nF. fragrans, Roxb.\n\nIn the Materials for a Flora of the Malay Peninsula the description and quoted collection numbers for this plant include a tree very distinct in life but less easily separated from herbarium specimens. This species is I am pretty certain the plant intended by Blume in his Fagraea speciosa (Rumphia II. p. 33, tab. 81).\n\nF. fragrans, Roxb. F. peregrina, Blume. Is a tree about 60 feet tall with a diameter of 1-2 feet. The bark is rough and thick deeply irregularly grooved, and brown. The leaves are elliptic acuminate narrowed at the base dark green dull with perfectly straight edges, nerves 8 pairs. The cymes are less lax than those of F. speciosa. The calyx lobes are short and ovate. The corolla tube \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long, trumpet shaped, the lobes oblong obtuse reflexed, as long as the tube. The stamens are long protruded, the anthers ovate, horse-shoe shaped, the loculi having a deep depression between them at the base.\nThe berry globose scarlet. Seed irregularly quadrate dark brown pustulate.\n\nThis plant is the Tembusu of the Malays, and a very well known and beautiful tree, whether in flower, covered with its masses of creamy white flowers scenting the air, or when bearing its bright orange red berries. It occurs in open country only, and comes up frequently in secondary scrub. In the Botanic Gardens it comes up everywhere in the grass plots where the seeds has been carried by bats or birds, or as I have seen by the fruit-eating ants.\n\nSpecimens have been distributed from the Botanic Gardens herbaria under Gardens (Ridley 5817); Pahang: Pekan (1028); Penang: Telok Bahang (Curtis 314); Malacca: Merlimau (Derry 53). I have also met it wild in the Dindings and Province Wellesley.\n\n*F. speciosa*, Bl. is a very different looking tree, which attains a height of 100 feet and a diameter of 3-4 feet. The bark is curious, being channelled in long straight grooves, much less rough than in *F. fragrans*. The leaves are lanceolate gradually narrowed to the petiole and long acuminate, polished light green and conspicuously undulate even when dry, nerves five pairs. The cymes are more lax than in *F. fragrans*. The flowers orange yellow, and rather smaller. The calyx lobes more lanceolate, obtuse. Nerves 5 pairs. The corolla tube \u00bc inch long but nearly cylindric, and the lobes lanceolate-obtuse much narrower and shorter than the tube. The filaments are twice as long as the corolla lobes. The style is long and yellowish with a capitate stigma. The berry is oblong in outline and always yellow.\n\nThis tree is an inhabitant of the dense forests, though there are a few in what is now open country in Singapore, at Tanglin, they are merely the survivors of an old long destroyed forest. The tree is known, as Tembusu paya, Tembusu Bukit, and Tembusu Tembaga and is valued for its timber which is of much greater size than that of *F. fragrans*. The timber is indeed so durable, that there\nis in the Garden Jungle, a stump of one of these trees, which has been felled upwards of fifty years ago. The wood of this stump is still very hard, and very resinous. On the top of the stump grows a fairly large tree of *Cumpassia Malaccensis*.\n\nThis plant has been distributed under, Singapore: Garden Jungle (Ridley 5818, 8921); Malacca: Bukit Sebukor (Derry 272).\n\nIt is by no means as heavy a flowerer as *F. fragrans*, and sets comparatively little fruit.\n\nI have little doubt that Blume's *F. speciosa* is this plant, though he figures the flowers white.

Its appearance certainly suggested that its affinities lay with the Neottiae section among which saprophytes are not at all uncommon. But in the plants obtained in Bukit Sadanen in Malacca, I found what appeared to be a distinct disc to the pollen masses and the anther is not at all like that of most\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\nNeottieae. I have recently (April 17, 1907) rediscovered the plant in Singapore, in dense forests by the side of a stream at a spot formerly known as Stagmount, and have thus had an opportunity of examining the plant again. The Singapore plant differs from the ones found in Malacca in having the lip nearly quadrate with a central tooth and hardly distinctly bilobed, the limb white and only the claw violet. The rostellum very small in the Malacca plant seems quite absent and the curved sausage-shaped pale flesh-colored pollinia have no trace of any disc at all. This plant was evidently destined to be self-fertilised as the pollinia slip into the stigma with the greatest ease. The filament so long in the Malacca plant is quite short in the Singapore one. For the present it may be preferable to consider the Singapore plant as a variety, *Singaporeensis* of the species.\n\nNow in the light on the plant shown by this variety, we can more easily determine its affinity, and that is I think with the genus *Gastrodia*, to which it is allied in its stout rhizome, its connate perianth, (for the whole of the perianth is connate at the base, though divided into two lips, one consisting of the sepal and two petals, the other of the two lower sepals), and the form of the pollinia. *Gastrodia* differs in the almost completely tubular flower, and the very short stelidia.\n\n*Leucolena ornata* var. *Singaporeensis*.\n\nLip subquadrate with a median tooth hardly bilobed, limb white, base violet. Rostellum quite absent. Pollinia free + with no disc. Filament of anther much shorter.\n\nDamp sandy woods on a stream bank at Stagmount, Singapore, flowering in April 1907.\n\nZINGIBERACEAE.\n\n*Geocharis*, n. gen.\n\nCreeping herbs with rather slender rhizomes throwing up leafy stems and inflorescences at intervals. Leaves\nelliptic to lanceolate shortly petioled. Inflorescence on a tall or short peduncle covered with long green sheaths, raceme erect many flowered. Flowers orange or red very shortly pedicelled. Bracts very small spathaceous. Calyx tubular trifid, lobes caudate ciliate. Petals as long somewhat similar. Lip deeply bifid into two narrowed linear lobes base adnate to the corolla. Stamen filament broader than the anther involute forming a tube with the lip, with two short subulate staminodes at the upper angle. Anther broad oblong with an entire ovate appendage. Style stout. Stigma obtuse curved sub-bilobed. Stylodes annulate lobed.\n\nJohore, Sumatra and Borneo.\n\nThis genus though based on a plant obtained in Johore, I think must include one at least and probably both of the plants described by Schuman under the section Geocharis of Alpinia vis. A. macrostemon, Schumann of Sumatra, and probably Alpinia decurva, Ridley a New Guinea plant. I have therefore adopted Schumann's sectional names as a generic names for these plants. Schumann who included a great many and very varied plants in the genus Alpinia, noted the fact that both the above mentioned plants resembled the genus Riedelia, and it is possible that A. decurva, Ridl. may belong to that Papuan genus. I cannot see any connection with or resemblance to the plants of the genus Geostachys, as suggested by him.\n\nG. aurantiaca, n. sp.\n\nRhizome \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch thick, leafy stems about 2 feet tall swollen at the base, sheaths rugose closely brown hairy blade a foot long \\( 4\\frac{1}{2} \\) inches wide elliptic glabrous deep green shining above, paler beneath, petiole \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long brown hairy. Peduncle of inflorescence 1 inch long, covered with long loose deep green rugose sheaths. Raceme 5 inches long, flowers crowded very shortly stalked numerous. Bracts minute spathaceous. Calyx\ntubular 3 lobed, lobes caudate hairy 1\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch long, glabrous except at the cuspidate tip, orange. Corolla lobes equally long linear oblong orange. Lip as long as the anther, deeply split into two linear lobes for nearly all its length lobes obtuse crimson with a yellow edge. Anther oblong pale yellowish with a small ovate crest, filament broad, edges involute towards the lip and forming a tube with it, pinkish yellow, with two subulate points at the top near the anther. Stylodes forming a shortly 3 lobed pale violet ring. Style stout, stigma obcuneate, upper lip longer than the lower and incurved. Base of filament in the tube with a large tuft of silky hairs. Ovules numerous.\n\nJohore: In thick low swampy forest at Kukub. In bud April 1908. Borneo, Sarawak: Bidi (Hewitt Aug. 1907).\n\nThis remarkable plant seems most nearly allied to the genus *Riedelia* which is confined to the Papuasian region of the Archipelago.\n\nThe separate inflorescence and the corolla-like sepals are very remarkable points of difference, and the broad involuted filament forming a tube with the lip though free from it is very curious. I only found one plant of it in bud.\n\nThe woods in which this plant occurs are remarkable in many ways. The soil consists of nothing but dead and rotten timber and vegetable debris, for a very considerable depth, below and in other parts of the estate there is a great deal of a very greasy stiff clay. The presence of recognisable fruits of the Nipa palm show that this part of the coast was marine at no very distant period. The mangrove swamps and tidal streams seem to have receded and been covered up with a dense wet forest, containing a somewhat peculiar flora. The trees are of very large size, *Cumpasia Malaccensis* being very abundant. The absence of *Nephrodiums Lastreas* and such ferns is very striking, and indeed the\nterrestrial ferns common in the clayey woods of Singapore and the greater part of the Singapore flora is not represented, except in the matter of epiphytes. *Calanthe veratrifolia*. A very fine form with unusually grey leaves, *Lepidogyne longifolia* otherwise only known from Penara Bukit in Penang, *Cystorchis purpurascens*, *Plocoglottis javanica*, *Nephelaphyllum pulchrum* were among the terrestrial orchids. In some spots the preponderance of Monocotyledons over Dicotyledons was very marked. Thus some parts of the forests consisted of *Phrynium malaccense* and *Ph. hirtum*, *Donax grandis*, *Alpinia melanocarpa*, *Plagiostachys albiflora* n. sp., with several other Zingiberaceae not in flower. *Zalacca conferta* and *Wallichiana*; one or two species of *Daemonorops*, *Calamus pencillatus* and several species of *Pinanga*, and *Nenga Wendlandiana*, *Oncosperma tigillaria* and *Pholidocarpus Kingianus* a few tree ferns, and some large dicotyledonous trees, formed the rest of the flora. *Schismatoglottis Wallichii* often in great abundance, *Alocasia longiloba*, *Homalomena rostrata* represent the aroids.\n\nThe immense mass of vegetable debris forming the soil to a considerable depth, without any apparent mixture of mineral matter, not a pebble or fragment of stone being visible over the whole of this area, suggests that the tertiary coal deposits of Borneo and Labuan have had some such origin as this.\n\n*G. rubra*, n. sp.\n\nRhizome slender with strong rather stout roots.

Anther oblong curved, with the cells slightly diverging at the tip, appendage very short rounded ovate, filament below the anther for some way linear flat fleshy, then winged widely with the staminodes in the form of two short triangular subulate processes. Style and stigma about as long as to the tip of the appendage.\n\nBorneo, Sarawak: at Quop (Hewitt, March 1908). Flowers red.\n\nThis species differs from the preceding in its much smaller size, short racemes of long pedicelled flowers, and colour. The wings of the filaments, evidently the attached staminodes do not reach as high in this species as in the other, where they are adnate to the anther. The lip is not split so far down and is free for a longer distance.\n\n*Alpinia vittata*, Hort. Bull. Nicholson Gard.

Stylodes forming a complete circle with numerous vertical grooves.\n\nNew Ireland (Micholitz).\n\nThis plant has long been in cultivation for its ornamental foliage. I saw it in Ceylon Botanic Gardens in 1888, and it appears to have been introduced before that. It was named *Castus zebrinus* in Ceylon. Probably *Alpinia albolineata*, Williams Cat. 1880 is the same thing. The flowers do not appear to have ever been described nor has any proper description of the plant ever been published. It is only mentioned in Schumann\u2019s *v. Scitamineae* in the *Pflanzenreich*. It is best I think to refer it to the genus *Alpinia* though it differs from typical species of that genus in the entire lip of the same shape as the corolla lobes but more fleshy, and the prolongation of the very thick connective into a crest behind the anther, and the lip connate with the filament up to the anther.\n\n*A. grandiceps*, n. sp.\n\nA stout plant, stem over \u00bc inch through.

Anther an inch long with the long curved appendage.\n\nSingapore: Stagmount, in thick woods. In flower April 1908.\n\nThis superb species was certainly quite a surprise. I had many times explored the Stagmount woods, but had never came across this plant although I had been several times close to where this time I discovered it. It belongs to the same group as Z. gracile, Jack, and Z. Griffithii, but is very distinct in its brilliant yellow spikes, those of all the others of this group being pinkish red. It is much larger in all its parts than any other species of this section here except Z. puberula, Ridl. which rivals it in height of stems at least. In flower spike and flower this plant is bigger than any of this section. Its deep green shining leaves and the numerous bright yellow spikes make it the most attractive of its group.\n\nPlagiostachys albiflora, n. sp.\n\nA tufted plant about six feet tall.
