By the Edkins, D.D., Peking, Honorary Member of the Asiatic Society.\n\nSON has drawn attention to the mention in early inscriptions, and the connection between vessels with those of Ethiopia. The ships at a very remote period voyaged to bring gold and other articles to use in the distant demand of markets. The Euphrates' ancient quays at which the primitive navigators unloaded their vessels. They proceeded themselves into the ocean, and there they were guided by the heavenly bodies. These continued from the time when Ur was 300, down to the period of the Persian invasion began to decline. During all this time, the navigators of the Indian Ocean, whether Arabian, Phoenician, or Egyptian, were conveying knowledge from one country to another.\n\nand Greeks planted mercantile settlements where they traded in the Mediterranean, and done the same in a thousand ports and the islands and countries east of India know to have taken place from the monarchies, vol. i. pp. 101, 102. He cites Sir Henry Layard, Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. XXVII. p. 185.\ntime of the Caliphs downwards on the south coast of Asia in connection with Arabian trade would, for the same reasons, take place in the times of the more ancient traders before the Christian era. The mercantile colonists would take wives in the cities where they settled. The new generation that grew up would speak the language of the new country as well as that which was the mother-tongue of the trading colonists, and the way would in consequence be open for free communication of ideas. New facts and notions could, for example, be conveyed from Phoenicia, Arabia, Mesopotamia and Egypt, to India, Ceylon, and the islands and regions east of India. To give an example of this, it is found recorded in an old Chinese book on botany, written by a prefect of Canton in the fourth century, that several plants, such as Jessamine and Henna, were then growing at Canton, having been brought there by traders coming from Arabia and the Roman empire. The well-known \"Moli hwa,\" a species of jessamine, now used for scenting tea and snuff, is among these exotic plants. In the same book sugar is spoken of as a product of Cochin China known at Canton. It has now become a staple product of the provinces of Canton and Fukien. The Henna flower is now commonly used in North China for dyeing the finger-nails red. This custom is a favourite one among women. The plant was conveyed on merchant vessels fourteen hundred years ago by foreigners called Hu, here meaning Arabe, as is most probable. It is said to have been taken to Canton from the Roman empire Ta Tsin. Egypt, where it is indigenous, then belonged to that empire. The Chinese were able to obtain not only an African plant at that time, but to learn also the empire to which the country where the plant grew belonged, and this knowledge they could acquire because there was resident then in Canton a trading colony of Arabs. This was in the pagan times, before the age of Mahommed. The members of this colony, always spoken of by the Chinese simply as Hu or foreigners, would maintain Sabean worship, and they would be able to teach something of what the Arabs then\nNAVIGATION IN THE INDIAN OCEAN.\n\n... but with it would be included the old ship.\n\n... let me mention here that the of Canton included among them at the end\n\n... the uncle of Mahommed.

We speak of oriental magnificence,\n\noriental hospitality, oriental imagination,\n\nThe reason why the word Oriental serves\n\n'ersia, and Arabia alike, is partly because\n\nways maintained between these countries\n\nned a considerable identity in customs,\n\nreligion.\n\nof the art of writing into India needs\n\nthe agency of just such mercantile settle-\n\neast of India as would necessarily exist\n\ne of Solomon. The discussion of the\norigin of the Indian alphabet occupied two sittings of the Congress of Orientalists at Leyden in 1883, and was conducted throughout with great vigour and unflagging interest. The hypothesis which met with most acceptance was the Ph\u0153nician hypothesis. The Ph\u0153nician alphabet, as developed in South Arabia and preserved in the Himyaritic inscriptions, gave origin in the east to the Indian alphabet and in the west to the Ethiopic. The two most distant dependencies of the Persian empire came to have each an alphabet thus derived. This view seems to be more or less supported by Professor Weber, Dr. B\u00fchler, the Rev. Isaac Taylor, and the late Professor Lenormant, as well as by Mr. Cust, who so ably introduced the subject to the Congress. On the mode of introduction of the Semitic alphabet Mr. Cust said, \"Unquestionably the continuous existence of a commerce between Yemen and South India can be asserted from a very remote period, quite sufficient to meet all requirements.\" The Vattelutu alphabet, which has influenced the Tamil, was certainly, the same writer adds, like the Semitic alphabet in several points. The Ph\u0153nician hypothesis, as now maintained, singles out the sixth century before Christ as the period when the Indian writing was first used extensively.\n\nBut if the alphabetic writing then commonly used in Western Asia was introduced through the agency of mercantile colonies at places on the Indian coast as early as 600 years before Christ, may we not expect that other arts then existing and acquisitions in knowledge of various kinds would enter India in the same manner? The changes which took place in Hindu philosophy and those ideas of an extended kind on the outer world, on cosmogony, and on the future life, which began to appear in India after the Vedic period, may have been caused by the same maritime intercourse with Western Asia and Egypt. In China, from about the sixth century before Christ, somewhat similar changes occurred in cosmogony, in philosophy, and in cosmography, and the hypothesis of mercantile settlements in Cochin China would be very convenient as an aid to show\nof foreign knowledge were likely to have ina as the result of the ocean traffic which the Indian seas. Surely, while Chinese ing slowly through its successive revolu- and national life, it was not unaffected by\n\nMax M\u00fcller's History of Ancient Sanskrit act of an abrupt change in Hindu literature a of the Vedas and that of the Brahmanas pointed out. He says, \"There is through- as such a complete misunderstanding of the i of the Vedic hymns, that we can hardly such an estrangement could have taken e had been at some time or other a sudden t in the chain of tradition.\" In the days weakness which then overtook the Hindu author shows how, for example, the pro- Vedas became at a later period a god, and\n\nNew gods were invented in profusion, ese new mythological personages over- planted the deities of the Vedic age. gonies were invented, and in the Buddhist Puranas, an entirely new mode of de- ld is adopted, in which the ocean plays is part. In the Vishnu Purana it is said e Being placed the earth on the summit here it floats like a mighty vessel, and ive surface does not sink beneath the Puranas represent Mount Meru as in the h, around which lies Jambudwipa, and the ported by some animal.\" This animal is monster. Otherwise a tortoise is repre- ing the earth. A circular wall of rock e world. Within it are seven other con- rocks. Between each circle is a sea. s swim in these seas. Into this new\n\nVishnu Purana in Hardy's Manual of Buddhism.\nsystem of the world the sun, moon, and stars, together with the zodiac and the twenty-seven lunar mansions, made an entrance, and later the Ptolemaic system. All these ideas are very much of a foreign character, and while they may have reached India by land, it would seem that they were more likely to arrive by sea, because the mercantile colonies in the seaport towns of the Indian coast would furnish facilities for the ready transference of thought from foreign languages into the current speech of India.\n\nThe time when Babylonian astronomy, and cosmogony with the idea of vast seas, a central mountain, and a rocky limit to the earth, could be introduced to India by sea was possibly not earlier than B.C. 800, for that is the time when Professor Max M\u00fcller supposes the Rig Veda to have been completed. But the date when this new accession of knowledge of cosmogony from Babylon and of the metempsychosis from Egypt would not be later than the time of Buddha, for this great teacher found all India believing in the metempsychosis, which is not a Vedic doctrine: the focus of this foreign influence upon India was therefore in the sixth, seventh and eighth centuries. Late in the seventh century Babylon was powerful under Nabopolassar\u2014and Necho, whose ships circumnavigated Africa, was reigning in Egypt. The maritime prosperity of Babylon would be at its height at that time, and the Persian conquest by Cyrus of that city B.C. 538 would not diminish mercantile activity. In the sixth and seventh centuries Indian trade could not be other than highly flourishing. Babylonians, Arabs, and Phoenicians would be found residing on the Indian coast, when some political revolution brought the Sanskrit or Pali-speaking population of the north into that part of India. The same sort of agency which introduced the art of writing would also introduce the metempsychosis of Egypt, with the astronomy, the zodiac, and the cosmogony of Babylon. Probably it was not from one country only that India received these accessions of knowledge, for the Arabs believe in a vast rocky circle bounding the world, and forming\nof the ocean, as the Buddhists do, and they fond of the sea. The Hindus may have tion from them.\n\nof these foreign influences was a complete Hindu thought. The new leaven worked ugh the mass of Hindu society. The natural Vedas was exchanged for an extravagant a vastly extended universe. Native thinkers w bases in constructing their systems.

The reason why just about this time lu systems of philosophy sprang into life was ulus to the native intellect was imparted by introduced just then along the coast from less degree by the passes of the north-west.

In the twelfth century B.C. there was, as tradition shows, a large accession of new knowledge by this route. This was when Chow Kung was Prime Minister, and its effects are found in his writings and the institutions with which his name is associated. In the sixth century a distinct and remarkable change took place in Chinese literature.\n\nTo show the nature of this change in Chinese literature, I shall take some examples from Tso, the historian, and Lie tsze, the Tauist philosopher, the one illustrating the subject of astrology, and the other that of cosmography. Tso c'chieu ming, in his history, when he comes to the year B.C. 549, mentions that Jupiter, the \"year star,\" as he is called, ought to have been in Sagittarius, and Capricornus R.A. 280\u00b0 to 300\u00b0, or, as it is called, Sing ki, but had irregularly advanced to Aquarius or Hiuen Hiau. This is the first sign of the zodiac of twelve, and belongs to the month December. It is a bad omen that Jupiter should during this year enter the sign in which he should be next year. At the time there was no ice, the dark principle yin not being able to overcome the bright principle yang (warmth). It is the snake mounting the dragon. The dragon is the star group of the kingdoms Sung and Cheng. These two States, therefore, will suffer from famine. In explanation, it is said that the snake rules winter, and that Jupiter represents wood, which is symbolized by the blue dragon. When Jupiter wanders from his place into the winter region, the spring dragon is subject to the control of the winter snake. Further, the central star of winter is called H\u00fc, \"empty.\" Hiau also means \"waste.\" The countries affected, therefore, must suffer from emptiness and waste. There will certainly be famine.\n\nThere is a passage occurring under the year 564 which speaks of the people of the Sung country learning by the stars to foresee what heavenly retribution for crimes would happen (Legge's C'hun T'sien, p. 439). The official director of fire, as folklore tells us, being meritorious, was sacrificed to, along with a star. Antares was the star chosen.\ntern quarter of the zodiac.

The brothers\ner, the Emperor Yau sent Ot pak to live\nin Shang ch'ieu, there to preside over the worship of the star Ch'en (Ta hwo) or Antares. Thus this star became the patron star of the Shang people. At the same time Shi chen was removed to Ta hia to preside over the star Shen, the \"belt of Orion.\" This place was Tsin yang, now embraced in Tai yuen fu, capital of the province of Shansi: eventually in the Cheu dynasty this star Shen became the recognized patron of Tsin.\n\nDr. Gustave Schlegel, in his Uranographie Chinoise, rightly regarded these stories as fables. They are introduced into the history through the love of the author for folklore. This folklore is for research very valuable, as helping us to trace out the history of astrology. The worship of stars by particular cities was in full use at least five centuries and a half before Christ. At that time the legends were so well established in popular faith that they may well have been some centuries old. These instances show what stories of an astrological nature prevailed at that time in regard to some cities in Honan and Shansi. Similar legends would exist in other cities. The following particulars refer to T'ai t'ai, the other spirit supposed to have caused an illness to the nobleman above mentioned.\n\nT'ai t'ai and Yun ke were the sons of Hiuen ming shi, director of water, who was descended from Shau hau, an ancient emperor. T'ai t'ai cleared the channel of the Fen river, which flows through Shansi into the Yellow River and also deepened the Tau river. In consequence he was made by the Emperor Chwen hu superintending baron to the Fen chwen region. Sacrifices were offered to him by the four states, Chen, Sz, Ju, Hwang, all ruled by his descendants till they were absorbed by Tsin. T'ai t'ai continued to be god of the Fen river in the Tsin state.\n\nThe origin of the legends must be sought in the notion of local star-worship. This would come in possibly in the eleventh century, or earlier. It might also with more probability have been later. The worship was to be performed by some member of the baronial family, usually the baron. There was a selection made of some ancestor to be worshipped\none would serve the purpose who had had\nsuggested suitability for this honour. But\nwas legendary, and not historical; there is\nBook of Odes, the Book of History, or the\nlegends. This circumstance favours their\ntion of the sixth and seventh centuries\nthey would then be a century or two\ntime of Tso c'hiu ming.\n\nthe origin of the zodiacal sign Shi'chen,\nour Cancer and Leo, it is perhaps derived\nns from a foreign source, either by trans-\nor by translation.

Text and comment have both been used in the statement now given of the place of the sun, moon, Mercury, and Jupiter on the day when Wu Wang (B.C. 1120) started on his expedition to conquer the Shang dynasty. Professor Russell, of Peking, kindly undertook to calculate with these data, and found that no such relative position of these four bodies was possible at the time stated.\n\nThis account of the astrological position of the Cheu kingdom in the constellation Hydra below Cancer and Leo is evidently post-dated, and must be referred to the eighth, seventh, or sixth century before Christ. The reasons for this opinion are various. The division of the empire among the 28 constellations is duodecimal and remarkably regular. It is as follows, as arranged by late writers and inserted in the work Tien Yuen li li:\n\n| No. | Constellation       | Region                  |\n|-----|---------------------|-------------------------|\n| 1   | Kio Kang            | Cheng                   | Central Honan.         |\n| 2   | Ti, Fang, Sin       | Sung                    | Eastern Honan.         |\n| 3   | Wei, Ki             | Yeu, Yen                | (Fu kien, kiang si) Chili. |\n| 4   | Teu, Nieu           | Wu                      | Kiang su, Che kiang.   |\n| 5   | N\u00fc, H\u00fc, Wei         | Tsi                     | North Shantung.        |\n| 6   | Shi Pi              | Wei                     | South Chili.           |\n| 7   | Kwei Low            | Lu                      | South Shantung.        |\n| 8   | Wei, Mau, Pi        | Chau                    | Western Chili.         |\n| 9   | Tsui, Shen          | Tsin                    | Shansi.                |\n| 10  | Tsing, Kwei         | Ts'in                   | Shensi, Kansu.         |\n| 11  | Lieu, Sing, Chang   | Cheu                    | Western Honan, Hupei, South Shensi. |\n| 12  | Yi Chen             | Ch'u                    | Hunan, Si chwen, Kwangsi. |\n\nThe states Cheng (1) and Ts'in (10) are included. The first barons of these two states only received full investiture in the years B.C. 806 and B.C. 769 respectively. They are not separable from the others, for without them four of the twenty-eight constellations would be left without a special kingdom to shine upon and to be worshipped by. In the work Si ku tsien shu of last century, when the genuineness\nas a work of B.C. 1100 is discussed, the names of these two states is mentioned as of that work at least was written long after same argument goes to show in regard to he local astrology of the feudal states that nenced after the dates B.C. 805 and B.C. 769. classics were all anonymous, so also was, it Cheu li, for it does not state who was its lat time it was written. The words which cation of the twenty-eight constellations to al states are few. \"The officer known as rules the stars in heaven, and takes note of ith those of the sun, moon, and planets, in y be seen what changes will take place on ther they will be fortunate or unlucky. ds as corresponding with certain stars, the provinces is so subdivided that each feudal , or more constellations which control it, be seen its good and ill fortune.

But if this principle of regarding Cheu as the starting-point for orientation suits in some instances, it fails in most cases, and it is probably better to seek another cause, such as the actual place of Jupiter when the allocation was made in each case. There is no reason to doubt, then, that the Cheu li being a manual of official duty, if the duties were at any time increased, there would be an addition made to the book. In Cheu Kung's time there may have been an elementary astrology. I plead only for the developed astrology of the eighth, seventh, and sixth centuries, that there was an addition made to the text of the portion which defines the duty of the official astrologer in regard to the local distribution of stars.\n\nThe native critics of modern times have shown great want of confidence in the genuineness of the Cheu li. In the Sung dynasty this book was ascribed to Lieu hin of the first century B.C. and A.D. Mau si ho attacked this view, and ascribed the book to the Contending States period, or the fourth century B.C. Supposing this date to be correct, there is still more reason for not placing the astrology of the feudal states before the time which, as above shown, the facts seem to require. The clepsydra is not mentioned in any of the classics except this. But we know from Greek sources that the clepsydra was a Babylonian instrument, and was originated by the Babylonians. At least Sextus Empiricus ascribes it to them,\u00b9 and states that they used an instrument of this kind in astrological calculations, and by means of it during the diurnal revolution of a star divided the zodiac into twelve equal parts. The officer who had this instrument in charge is called the carrier of the clepsydra. From this it would seem that the instrument was not like those at present in use at the Peking Observatory, which are bronze vessels of great weight, arranged in successive steps as on a staircase. It was of a size and weight suitable for being lifted by an officer. It is mentioned in the Shwo wen as being made of bronze. Curiously enough it is alluded to\n\n\u00b9 Since this was written Professor Russell has found that in B.C. 806, Jupiter was in the required constellations Kio and K'ang.\nace to the Odes supposed to have been Hia in the fifth century before Christ.\n\nthink this preface reads like a Han o. Whatever be the age of the Cheu li, to the Odes, the astrological passages in d in the Kwo y\u00fc help us to place the wide sial astrology in China not later than the re Christ. With this should also be placed of the clepsydra, because such an instru xtremely useful when every feudal capital had its astrological department, and the arance of stars and planets had to be care-\n\nrance of the clepsydra in China seems to abylonians had communicated this instru ore the Greeks had it. It is mentioned in l Aristotle among Greek writers, but eir time. We may do well to remember ma o'chien in connection with the official says, \"When the empire ceased to be well-rect succession of new moons was not s feudal barons. After the emperors Yeu (c. 770 and 827 respectively), the influence sty fell away, the officers ceased to take es, nor did the emperor announce the new nd pupils of the official astronomers and came scattered, either in different parts g barbarian races.

The say that there was an entire cessation of t the court of Cheu. He simply mourns\nover the decline of activity and efficiency as shown by mistakes in the calendar, and by the dispersion of official schools of instruction. South China would attract some of these wanderers, and some would reach places on the sea. We can judge of what the condition of South China then was by the poetry of Chu Yuan. The country was inhabited by a people inclined to mystic Taoism and polytheistic legend, into which the personages of Chinese primitive history were boldly introduced, mixed with many foreign-looking novelties of marine myth and semi-divine hero. This vast region was known as the Chu country. It throve by trade in its own produce and the commercial transmission of foreign articles. Astrology, the dial and the clepsydra, would come by the trade routes which lay through South China from Cochin Chinese ports, where, at that time, by the regular development of ocean trade, there would be merchants of western origin residing, who would speak local languages as well as some one of the languages of Western Asia. In this way the system of judicial astrology with the Babylonian cosmography might quite readily be introduced to the knowledge of the Chinese about B.C. 506 and later.\n\nMy argument requires me now to proceed to the question of the extended knowledge of the Chinese of the earth generally in the Chow dynasty, and to point out how it becomes a necessity to account for it by supposing an early enlarged commerce in the Indian Ocean reaching all the way to Cochin China before as well as after the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus. First there are some very interesting relics of a trigonometrical kind in an old Chinese book of the Chow dynasty. This book speaks of the earth's surface being round, and makes use of the sun-dial to measure the earth by taking as values the height of a gnomon, the length of its shadow, and the sun's altitude. They understood the properties of the right-angled triangle, and attempted by the use of the gnomon to measure the earth in a rough way. Mr. Wylie\n\n1 A part of it has been translated by the Marquis d'Hervey de St.-Denys.\nNotes on Chinese Literature, p. 86), \"The ; is the only ancient work we have on the astronomy.\" By this name is meant that verse which represents the heavens as an earth as a bowl turned over and lying at there were two forms of the umbrella theory. earth as a flat and square plain, the other as having an immense convex but still his last is the view of the Chow pi swan in question, and it is also described in the zomy 1 as given in the Tsin history. The umbrella astronomy is invalidated by unions. \"A gnomon 2 of eight feet at the shadow of one foot six inches. Go south is one foot five inches. Go north 1000 li, foot seven inches.

But here keu means the shadow of the gnomon. These names have continued in use from the Chow dynasty downwards, and we may rely on them as ancient. The Chinese critics say of the book Chow pi swan king that while the first catalogue which mentions it is that of the Sui History, A.D. 600, yet it must on various grounds be regarded as a genuine relic of the Chow dynasty. Judging by the materials, style of thought, and statements of the book, they are probably right. But if so, we have a distinct relic of old Babylonian science worked up by Chinese mathematicians of the Chow dynasty. The Babylonian elements are the following:\n\n1. The dial was used for distinguishing latitudes by the length of the shadow.\n2. The clepsydra was used for marking time.\n3. The length of the shadow, the gnomon and a point taken on the earth known with more or less certainty, were supposed to give as a fourth proportional the height of the sun or of heaven.\n4. The squares of the shadow and gnomon were known to be equal to the square on the hypothenuse, or the line joining their extremities.\n\nThese being fairly deserving of the epithet Babylonian, it is a point of interest that we are able to assign them with much probability to a date a little before B.C. 806 as the period of their introduction into China. We know from the Old Testament that the sun dial of Ahaz was taken to Jerusalem about B.C. 740. The Jews learned it with foreign religious observances forbidden to them by their law. The Chinese learned it with astrology and star-worship. Much depended on the place of Jupiter when stars were to be selected for a feudal barony. Whatever constellation happened to be the place of Jupiter in any year when the investiture of a baron took place might become the patron constellation of his barony. Now it appears that Kio and Kang, the first of the zodiac of twenty-eight, were assigned to Cheng, in Honan, and the investiture of the first baron\nyear B.C. 806. I asked Professor Russell to inform me where Jupiter was B.C. 806, and found that he was in Kio and Chong. Since, therefore, the first two constellations have been assigned to Cheng before that date, it is likely that it was at the same time that the territorial distribution of the constellations was carried out to something like its present form. Some years must have passed away before the belief in astrology, a foreign belief, could be introduced into China. Hence it may be concluded that the belief grew into prevalence in the ninth century.\n\nIn his translation of the Chow li, published by Mau si ho, himself in his criticism on its genuineness, he attacks the views of Han and Sung dynasty authors. He follows Lin's view, who decides for the Chow li as a work of Chow Kung, its immense multiplication of duties being caused by the inheritance in the traditional system of the Hia and Shang dynasties. Lin was in tone and principle a Sung writer, and great example of that school. Biot, however, criticizes and by tendency and inclination an author who stopped short with Mau si ho to consider the views of later Chinese writers' picture of the Chinese ancient world, not successful in placing it in full detail. But he has not done all that was necessary. Mau si ho's views respecting it are worth considering those Sung writers who ascribe it to the end of the first Han period, and rightly so, for an author might wish to flatter Wang Chong's opinion of the Chow li, he would not have thought this to carry out that end. It is too late for Mau si ho thinks it was a book of the third or fourth century.\n\nChow li wen, i. pp. 3, 10.\nbefore Christ, or perhaps somewhat earlier. There is much to be said for this view, seeing that Confucius, Mencius, and other authors do not quote this book, as they would have done if it were a classic in their times. But for my own part I feel more confidence in the criticism of the eighteenth century,\\(^1\\) which makes the Chow li neither a Han book nor a book of the Chan kwo times, but a book of the early Chow period, partly written by Chow kung, but added to subsequently. The reason why neither Confucius, Mencius, nor, immediately after them, Tso kieu ming, quote passages from it, may be that it was an official book not published. It belonged to a government office in Lo yang, while these three authors lived in the Loo kingdom, three hundred miles to the east. All the Chinese classics are the work of officers, excepting such of the poems as were collected by a commission, and such portions as came from the hand of Confucius. This book belongs to the Western Chow, but was preserved in the eastern capital of that time, viz. Lo yang. We know it was this city, because Chinese old writers,\\(^2\\) in commenting on the use of the gnomon mentioned in chapter 42nd of the Chow li, say that in Lo yang, at the summer solstice, the shadow was one foot five inches in length, which is the length of the gnomon given in the text. To this Chen kang cheng adds that in winter the shadow was thirteen feet in length. The foot of the Chow dynasty was about eight English inches in length.\\(^3\\) We translate Chih by foot, but, in fact, it is a span, and it was probably so in Babylonia also. On the hypothesis that the dial went from Babylon to China about the ninth century before Christ, we have in the Chinese ancient foot measure a possible value for the Babylonian foot and for the height of the gnomon they commonly used. Beside this we have also a possible origin of trigonometry. This science is said to have begun with the building of altars, but it may have begun in the use of\n\n\\(^1\\) Si ku tsuen shu, xix. pp. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 31, 36.\n\n\\(^2\\) Found in Kia kung yen's comment, and in that of Cheng.\n\n\\(^3\\) In the Kin shi so, \"Chain of metal and stone inscriptions,\" the Chow foot is eight English inches, the Han foot is 9\u00b78 inches, the Tsin 9\u00b7125, the Sung 10\u00b7625.

The world is supported by the\nfour feet of an immense monster, called Ngok.\\(^1\\) A legendary emperor or empress, named Nuko, cut off the feet of the monster to put them to this use. This was after he or she had already prepared stones of five colours to fill up defects in heaven and earth. In a subsequent struggle between two emperors the pillars of heaven were broken and the four cardinal points of the earth sundered. This caused the heavens to fall on the north-west, and consequently the sun, moon, and stars move to that point. The earth also became defective on the south-east, and that is the reason why the rivers all flow to that part of the world.\\(^2\\) East of the Gulf of Pechili is an immense abyss (Pacific Ocean). This bottomless sea is the home to which all waters flow. In this ocean are five islands, known by names such as Bom lai, all inhabited by immortal beings. These islands moved with the tide. This was a matter of grief to the immortals. They petitioned God (Ti) to relieve them, and he in anger caused the islands to float in the first place to the extreme west. Then under the guidance of Gugom, god of the north, a great Ngok lifted them by fifteen movements of the head upon his back. The five islands were afterwards borne by monsters of the same kind to the Lompak country. Two of them were liberated from these animals, floated to the north pole, and sank in the great sea there. Lie tsze speaks of giants many hundred feet high. East of China, at a distance of 400,000 miles, there is a nation of dwarfs called Tsok nok. They are a foot high. In the north are people about seven feet high. On the south of China is a country called Mim lim, and here five hundred years makes a spring and five hundred years an autumn. In the north is a sea called Mim hai. It is heaven\u2019s lake. The bird Bom found there has wings which look as wide as the clouds, and a fish called Kon is also found there which is several thousand miles long.\n\nIn the idea of an ocean round the world, and monstrous creatures inhabiting it belonging to either the fish or the\n\n\\(^1\\) Some Chinese words are here mentioned, with the pronunciation given to them by the ancient Chinese.\n\n\\(^2\\) An allusion to the prevailing direction of all Chinese rivers.\nChinese writers of the third and fourth\nhrist enter on a region entirely new to\nheir country.

He presides over the nine districts of the nine cities of heaven, and over the times of the gardens of God. There is a beast who is like a ram having four horns. His name is Dulu, and he eats human flesh. The Yellow river flows from this mountain, first north-east and then south. The Red river flows from it to the south-east, and enters the Bamten river.\u00b9 The Yang river flows from it to the south-west, and enters the Tudu river. The Black river flows from it to the west, and enters Tay\u00fc. Beyond it on the west, at a distance of about a thousand li, is the Jade-stone mountain, where the Queen of the West resides. She is called Si wang mu. She has a human appearance, but a panther\u2019s tail, and a tiger\u2019s teeth. Her hair is spread to the wind, and she wears jade ornaments.\n\nThe 6th, 7th, and 8th chapters of this book describe countries beyond the sea. In speaking, at the commencement, of southern regions, the book says they are ruled by the Tai sui, \u201cgreat year god.\u201d By this is meant the god of each year in the cycle of sixty. The god that rules each year varies in turn till each of the sixty has presided in his place. I place in a note the ten names of these gods for the decimal cycle, kia, yi, ping, ting, wu, ki, keng, sin, jen, kwei.\u00b2 At the end of the account of ocean kingdoms in the south, it is said that the god of fire ruling the south is named Tokyom. He has the body of a quadruped, with the face of a man, and he rides two dragons. In the same way, at the end of the account of western countries, it is added, the god of the west, Nok shu, has in his left ear a snake.\n\n\u00b9 Bamten looks like \u201cBrahma heaven.\u201d Ten is tien \u2018heaven.\u2019 Perhaps this is the Brahmaputra.

There is a nation called\ning, explains Kwo p'u, fish bodies and\nhuman faces. The grandson of the fiery emperor (Shen nung), named Ling k'i, was the father of the Hu people, who are able to ascend to heaven and descend from heaven to earth.\n\nThe idea of the soul ascending to heaven after death is old Chinese, applicable to the case of wise kings. The wise king, Wen wang, is said to have ascended to heaven after death. But this notion of the body ascending is a Tauist one, which appears to me to have been imported from abroad. Then when the idea was received and thought about, the Chinese of those times connected it with primitive Chinese traditions and emperors. Such stories obtain currency by passing from one person and locality to another. Reflecting persons have nothing to do with the process. It is the work of the unreflecting, and of those who gladly aid in the circulation of legends.\n\nThe commentary of Kwo p'u on the Shan hai king proves that this author had before him pictures illustrating the book. The expressions he uses when describing divinities and monsters of various kinds shows that this was the case. He speaks of what was on the right and left of the personage he is describing, in just such a way as he would do if he were looking at a picture. From this circumstance the modern critical school of China has decided that this author, writing about A.D. 300, used an illustrated edition of the Shan hai king when writing his comment. Fortunately it has ever since been the fashion, both in the days of manuscript and in printed editions, from the tenth century onward, to publish illustrations with the books, so that in modern editions we probably have pictures not very unlike those on which Kwo p'u looked while writing.\n\nThe process of legend making in the Chow dynasty thus appears to have included four elements. Foreign pictures and images; foreign names, incidents, beliefs, and statements; Chinese primitive traditions and personages; Chow dynasty inventions and combinations. These four elements seem to be woven together inseparably in the legends of the Chow dynasty. Thus when the Yellow Emperor is said to have\nwe have a Chow dynasty combination of\nese emperor with a newly-introduced idea\nign countries.

II.\u2014La Calle and the Country of the Khomair, with a Note on North African Marbles; being the Report of a recent Tour, addressed to H.M. Secretary of State. By Consul-General R. L. Playfair.\n\nCommunicated by R. N. Cust, Esq., Hon. Secretary, with consent of the Author.\n\nAlgiers, April 28th, 1884.\n\nMy tour really commenced at La Calle. I proceeded thither by the ordinary land route, and arrived at B\u00f4ne just in time to catch the Tunis steamer, which left on the 6th April. It was perfectly calm when the vessel left, but after we had been an hour at sea the sirocco, which had been blowing, was suddenly succeeded by a strong north-west gale, and when we arrived off the port, two hours later, we had the greatest difficulty in landing.\n\nThis district is of great historical interest, as it was here that the French first established themselves in North Africa. In 1520 certain merchants of Havre settled at Cape Negro for the purpose of trading with the Arabs and fishing for coral. These were followed, a few years later, by others from Marseilles, who, in 1524, founded the establishment known as the Bastion de France. Owing, however, to its exposed situation, and to the extreme insalubrity of the climate, caused by the emanations from the lake in its immediate vicinity, the Compagnie d\u2019Afrique transferred its establishment to La Calle in 1677.\n\nOn the occasion of my visit an English steamer, \u201cThe Black Sea,\u201d arrived there to load with mineral, and the master very obligingly offered to take me in her to visit the site of the old French factory. It is about thirteen kilom. to the west, on a small rocky promontory, forming a creek, entirely exposed to the north-west winds. This is not the\na detailed account of its history and of the\nthe French had to undergo, from perse-\nof the Arabs and of the Turks at Algiers,\nls and the ravages of pestilence.

It is now intended to close up the present entrance to the small port, and excavate another to the east, which will not be exposed to the prevailing bad weather. This will be convenient for the coral boats, but it will not permit a steamer to enter.\n\nOn the occasion of my visit six years ago I found the place in a high state of prosperity. Very extensive establishments had been created for salting sardines, and the coral fishery was in full activity. It still has a most prosperous appearance, and, what is rare in Algeria, an over-teeming population; but the sardines seem to have deserted the coast, the salting-houses are closed, the coral banks near the shore have been exhausted, and boats have to go much further off and to much deeper water. Their number also has greatly decreased; there used to be as many as 230 boats engaged in the coral fishery, and nearly as many catching sardines; now the total number does not exceed sixty.\n\nThis falling-off is no doubt due in a great measure to natural causes which no one can control, such as the discovery of rich coral banks on the coast of Sicily; but partly also to the inexplicable policy now in favour in Algeria, which discourages anything like foreign enterprise, and would almost seem framed with the object of getting rid of foreigners altogether from the Colony. Italian boats pay, in virtue of a special Convention, only 400 fr. a year as licence duty; all other nationalities pay 800 fr.; French boats are entirely exempted. The consequence is that all foreign boats are driven out of the trade. This one can understand, but it is hardly conceivable why almost every foreigner by nationality, though born in the Colony, on conviction of the most trivial offence, in addition to the punishment due for it, is sentenced to expulsion. Such cases are constantly brought to the notice of every foreign Consul.\n\nThere are three lakes of considerable size in the neighbourhood of La Calle. That furthest to the west is the Guerah-el-Melah, or, as it used to be called, l'Etang du Bastion. It has an area of 867 hectares and a depth of from\nThere is still a narrow communication with the sea, but in former times this was sufficient for coral boats to enter and use it as a shelter during bad weather.

This is an immense body of water, though a lake in winter; it is said its influence is felt as far as La Calle. To build a marsh would cost too much money, and it has never been formed to carry it out.\n\nBetween it and the sea is called the Oued de la small creek much frequented by coral fishermen. English steamers take in their cargoes from a hill called Kef Chetob by the Arabs, and by the Europeans; from its isolation and the mines of Kef Om-et-Teboul, which are tiferous and auriferous lead and zinc shipped to Swansea. The number of ships laden with it during the past three\nyears is as follows:\u2014In 1881, twelve vessels of 12,096 tons; in 1882, sixteen vessels of 15,436 tons; in 1883, twenty vessels of 26,367 tons.\n\nThe quantity of mineral actually extracted at the present time is not more than 12,000 tons per annum, but there are large reserves, and an immense mass of ore which was formerly thrown aside as useless, but which, owing to the advancement in metallurgy, can now be utilized. The firm which has contracted for this mineral is Messrs. Charles H. Thompson and Co., of London and Swansea. Their steamers are sent to the mouth of the Messida to take in cargo there.\n\nThe road up to the mines is good, and beyond it, passing by El Aioun, and crossing the frontier at the Col de Babouch, is an excellent carriage-road leading to Ain Draham. I kept along the lower route, through a wild and mountainous region intersected by deep ravines, and covered with dense brushwood of lentisk, tree heath, cistus, etc., with here and there patches of forest containing oak of various species and maritime pine.\n\nThe road crosses the frontier at some distance from the sea, passing over the high range of hills which terminates in Cape Roux. The cape itself is composed of steeply scarped rocks of a red colour; in former times it was crowned by another establishment belonging to the Compagnie d\u2019Afrique, and we can still see a cutting from the summit to the sea, a sort of slide, down which the corn purchased from the Arabs used to be sent to the ships which were ready to load with it beneath.\n\nShortly after this the road approaches the sea; the coastline is beautifully indented, and there are charming views of land and water at every turn, till at last the Island of Tabarca and the military position on the mainland, high above the town, come in view.\n\nI have given the history of this interesting place elsewhere; I may, however, be allowed to give a very brief recapitulation of it. It was at one time a Roman Colony. After the expedition of Charles V. to Tunis in 1535, the right of fishing for coral here was conceded to the Spaniards,\nntly made over to the Lomellini family\nge for the celebrated corsair Dragut, who\nby Andrea Doria. In 1741 it was cap-\nins; part of the inhabitants effected their\nof San Pietro in Sardinia, others peopled\nthe Island of Tabarca, near Alicante, on\nand the remainder were carried off and\n\nthis place six years ago it was almost\ntraveller could not venture far from the\nconsiderable precautions.

Around it have been erected temporary barracks and other subsidiary buildings, sufficient for a large garrison. This fort it is which was bombarded when the place was taken by the French, but it never was in a position to offer even a show of resistance.\n\nClose to the island may still be seen the hull of the \"Auvergne,\" a large four-masted steamer belonging to the Talabot Company, which was driven ashore in 1878. The wreck was pillaged by the Khomair, and though none of the crew were actually killed, some of them were grossly ill-treated; and this, it may be recollected, was one of the indictments against them, which ended in the occupation of their country and of the whole Regency by the French.\n\nAbout 10 kilom. to the east, at a place called Ras-er-Rajel (Man's Head), in the territory of the Oulad Yehia, and again nearly east of Cape Negro, 35 kilom. distant, there exist large and valuable deposits of iron and copper ore, which were pointed out to me during my former visit. These have been granted by the Government of Tunis to the powerful Company which already owns the mines of Mokta-el-Hadid, near B\u00f4ne, and those of Beni Saf, near Oran. They are about to commence work very shortly; they will lay down a line of railway to the mines, and will make a harbour by blocking up the shallow channel between the southern end of the island and the shore, thus forming a port which will be open only to the north-east, and which will be sheltered from the prevailing north-west winds by the island itself. It will be necessary to dig a new channel for the river which flows into the site of the new harbour, at least during the winter months, for in summer it does not reach the sea at all, thus creating a marsh which is a perfect hot-bed of malarious fever.\nhe property in the neighbourhood, now eylick, has been granted to the Company, d itself, a great part of which will be upply materials for the harbour works. Concession are very advantageous to the ide a payment to the State of 5 per cent.\n\nIn addition to the land conceded, they onsiderable amount from the Arabs at a luding half the present village; so there ir becoming nearly as complete autocrats Beni Saf.

How the \"invention\"\nof the Khomair actually did lead to the French Protectorate of Tunis is a matter of public notoriety.\n\nHaving procured horses at Tabarca, I started for Ain Draham, the military post in the heart of their country, on the 9th April. There is a good road in process of construction, but it is not yet nearly finished, and it must be a long time ere it will be practicable for wheeled conveyances; but it is an excellent bridle-path, even in the worst places, and for picturesque beauty, the country which it traverses can hardly be surpassed. It ascends the broad valley of the Oued-el-Kebir, opposite the Island of Tabarca, running nearly due south. The ground, wherever possible, is richly cultivated, and will no doubt one day be opened out to European colonization. At present, like all plains in North Africa, when undrained and insufficiently cultivated, that is, cultivated only in the rudimentary manner known to the Arabs, it is very unhealthy, but in due time that will be remedied; no places could have been worse, or are now better, than many parts of the Metidja, near Algiers.\n\nAll over the country there are the ruins of Roman farms or fortified posts; for the most part they are mere heaps of stone, but of large blocks finely cut. One of these, about 5 kilom. from Tabarca, is, however, of a more important character; part of the walls and one arched gateway are still standing; it is close to the river, and is called by the Arabs Kasr Zeitoun (\"Palace of the Olive Tree\"), from a group of gigantic olive trees which grow around it and in its deserted chambers.\n\nAt 17 kilom. from Tabarca is the Oued Kerma, a beautiful clear stream, so called from a large fig tree growing near it; a road bifurcating to the north-east leads to the \"Camp du G\u00e9nie,\" now unoccupied. Beyond, the scenery becomes wilder and more beautiful, consisting of great stretches of oak forest, interspersed with glades of cleared and cultivated land. Not an armed Khomiri was to be seen; the men were all engaged in ploughing the land for next autumn's crop, while the women were clearing the weeds from among the growing corn. All seemed to have a kindly word or a\nwe passed, and I saw none of the black hat I had noticed on my former journey. The people, however, was lean and miserably covered with disgusting rags, and their most squalid description, hardly comparable even in use among such barbarians as the Berbers.\n\nThe Col de Babouch, the junction of this road leading up from Kef Om-et-Teboul. Here we met an agent of the Tunisian Financial Police, and there was a camp of soldiers engaged in repairing the road. Beyond this we passed for a short distance through a forest of the most splendid cork trees seen; I noticed the same beautiful effect which had so much struck me before; the trees and the branches were covered with a thick growth of polypodium and other varieties of ferns.\n\nAin Draham came suddenly in sight, situated on a bleak hill-side, its regular houses being visible with red tiled roofs forming by no means a contrast with the beauty of the landscape through which we passed. The view from it, however, is magnificent, the whole length of the valley through which we passed, and seaward the Galita Islands, not appearing as if they were only a few miles distant.\n\nSituated at a distance of 31 kilom. due north and at 41 kilom. from La Calle, by the road Om-et-Teboul, El Aioun, and the Col de Babouch, 800 metres above the sea, and is well known from the \"Spring of Money,\" whence the water flows from numerous fountains. Until very lately there were about 3000 men, commanded by a General of Artillery, but now only a Colonel's command; there are still 2000 men, but a further reduction is contemplated, and there are numerous auberge and store keepers who can have no possible occupation except serving the troops and feeding the officers.\nThere is a fairly good h\u00f4tel, with an ornamental iron balcony, the rails of which form the words \"H\u00f4tel des Pacificateurs\"; the landlady evidently thinks that the French army is maintained expressly for her advantage, and is indignant at the place being left with an insufficient garrison.\n\nThere is no attempt at defence here; no redoubt, entrenchment, or even the simplest walled inclosure. The barracks of the troops and the huts of the settlers cover a considerable area of ground, and although the Khomair have been disarmed, no one really supposes them to be destitute of weapons. Insurrections have occurred in Algeria under more unlikely circumstances, and it is not impossible that some day a rising of this warlike tribe may temporarily endanger the French supremacy, or at least lead to the massacre of many women and children, who would find a safe refuge within a fortified position, if even one of the most rudimentary description.\n\nIt is impossible not to be struck by the extraordinary results which have followed the French Protectorate in this once inaccessible region. Admirable roads have been made, or are in process of construction, northwards to the sea at Tabarca, north-west to Algeria at La Calle, southward to the railway which traverses the valley of the Medjerda, and another has been traced to run eastward to Beja. With all these \"pacificateurs\" no serious fears need ever be entertained for the permanent security of the country.\n\nOn the 10th April I left Ain Draham in a carriage which I had sent up from La Calle: the first part of the road lies through splendid oak forests, but as it descends, these gradually become replaced by brushwood, and finally by open, undulating ground, more or less cultivated.\n\nAt Fedj-el-Meridj, 5 kilom. from Ain Draham, is a little grassy meadow, nestled amongst wooded hills. This evidently was a Roman post, as in the centre of it is a mound of stones, the best of which have been taken away for the construction of the road. One military column has, however, been spared; it bears the names of Constantine and Licinius, thus fixing the date prior to the defeat of the latter in A.D. 323.\nnumber XVIII, probably eighteen miles\n\ntion to Souk-el-Arba is at Fernana (20\ne derives its name from an immense cork\ne within several miles.

In the centre, to the north, is the spring, which rose in a large semicircular nymph\u00e6um of cut stone, from which leaden pipes issued for the distribution of the water in various directions. Immediately in front of it was an archway built of large blocks of very compact and finely-cut limestone. This was destroyed in the most barbarous manner to supply building material for the railway; the d\u00e9bris even now remaining on the spot gives it the appearance of a disused quarry.\n\nThe spring has now been inclosed within a ch\u00e2teau d'eau, and is conducted in iron pipes for the supply of Souk-el-Arba, which, until the last few days, has been supplied with water from Tunis by train. The surplus suffices to fill the nymph\u00e6um, and to form a marsh further down, full of eels and barbel of great size. Only a small spot on the border of this reservoir has been cleared to its original level; here a fine mosaic pavement has been discovered, and, to judge by the remains lying round about, this must have been a beautiful spot, decorated probably by temples and colonnades, somewhat like the well-known example at Zaghouan.\n\nLower down the valley, almost due south of the spring, are the ruins of the therm\u00e6. Like all the other buildings here, this has been overthrown by an earthquake. Huge masses of masonry lie around, disjointed and overthrown, in a manner that could not have been effected by any other agency. One high arch still remains entire, which helped to sustain the roof of the central hall. The subsidiary buildings are buried in d\u00e9bris nearly to the crown of their vaults. I have no doubt that these chambers will be found almost entire, and probably containing valuable works of art. It would be a great boon to archaeology if this building could be cleared out; in the meantime the earth and ruins which encumber it insure its preservation from the fate which has befallen the triumphal arch before mentioned. It is satisfactory to add that since a military camp has been formed at Souk-el-Arba, stringent orders have been given to respect all the ruins.\ning and the baths, but a little to the east, much buried in earth. One can descend to the corridors, and form a good idea of building. The masonry is all of the finest; the auditorium is entirely filled up, but one can see the spring of an arch, exists on the site.\n\nA little distance further east is the amphitheatre, built of brick, and apparently of an earlier epoch. It is constructed of less regular rubble, with only cut stone facing. It commanded, like all similar buildings, a wide view of the country round.\n\nThere are other edifices, more or less entire, some of which have all its chambers and vaulted roofs intact. One of these was used as a residence by the Romans, and was connected with the waterworks. There is also a series of contiguous cisterns of great size, too high to be seen from the ground; probably they were used for the collection of rain-water, which the Romans appear to have been more accustomed to use for drinking purposes.\n\nSouk-el-Arba is a distance of 7 kilom. from Souk-el-Arba (Market of Wednesday), and 34 kilom. from Ghardimaou, where the road presently terminates. An entrenched camp is situated near, in subordination to the Commandant of Ghardimaou. It is the nearest point of departure for the kilom.), to which place a mail-carriage runs daily. There is a tolerably good inn close to the station.\n\nI started my journey homewards on the 11th, but I was anxious to reach Chemtou, as I was anxious to see the ruins and Roman remains at that place. The railway station of Oued Meliz (Mehliz), is near Souk-el-Arba.\n\nColonia is mentioned in the itineraries, and appears to have been one of the stations on the road from Tunis to Carthage, but beyond this little is\nknown of its history, and no modern description of the ruins has been published; until the railway opened out the basin of the Medjerda, this part of the country was difficult of access and remote from the usual routes of travellers.\n\nClose to a spot where one of the numerous streams called Oued-el-Molah, or Salt River, flows into the Medjerda, are situated a line of small hills, covering an area of about 90 hectares, the highest point of which is 260 metres above the sea-level. They are composed almost entirely of marble of various kinds, but principally of giallo antico, rose-coloured marble, and a fine brownish breccia. There can be no doubt that these quarries were extensively worked by the Romans; large excavations made by them exist in various places, and numerous inscriptions have been found on blocks of marble which had been extracted but not carried away. I subjoin one out of many, without even attempting to make a guess at its meaning:\n\nIMP. ANTONINI AVG. PII : D\nN . . . . . . OHAGRIPR\nCAILICANOFIVEIPPECOS\n\nI was extremely glad to have had the opportunity of visiting this quarry, as it was the only one in North Africa that I had not yet seen. In the hope that a few remarks on the subject of Numidian marbles may prove of use to those interested in the marble trade, I attach a separate Memorandum on the subject.\n\nThe plain on both sides of the hills is covered with extensive Roman remains. The city must have been a very considerable one, larger and more important than its neighbour, Bulla Regia; the latter was probably a Royal residence, and inhabited by people unconnected with commerce; this one was a centre of trade, owing its existence probably to its rich marble quarries. There can be no doubt as to its name. Semuta and Semitus are found in several inscriptions both on tombstones and military columns; one of the former bears the truncated elegy of a man standing between two columns, and underneath is the following inscription:\nL. SILICVS OPIA\nTVS. VIX. AN. L.\nINITERCE PIVS\nINITINERE\nHVIC. VETERANI\nMORANTES\nSEMITV. DE\nO.

In one pillar I\nobserved four tombstones, some of them turned upside down; another pier had one such tombstone, and probably there were many more used, the inscriptions on which were turned inward. The necropolis was in the hills about 1\u00bd kilom. from the marble works, and, as there are very few stones now existing there, it is probable that the greater part of them were used for public works. It is worthy of remark that, while in the necropolis there are stones both of Pagan and Christian times, those which I have seen utilized as before described are entirely of the former period.\n\nI subjoin two inscriptions taken at random; the first has on the upper part the figures of two persons holding each other by the hand, and apparently making offerings on altars with the other hands; below it is the following:\n\nM.

It seems to have been broken down the middle; the height is 1 m. 57 c., the length of the lower side 1 m. 65 c., and of the upper one 1 m. 4 c. The letters are of unequal size, varying from 6 to 30 centim. in height. The whole inscription was contained within a raised moulding:\n\n. . [IMP. . C.]AESAR . DIVI\n. . [NERV]AE . F. . NERVA\n. . .

On his advice, and I returned on the line Beja (more correctly El Badja).\n\nA place on a former occasion, and I was opportunity of seeing the effect of the rain on it. The town is one of the oldest. I think it was one of the dirtiest. The smell of liquid manure, and the condition of that I could not stay long enough in it. Among Latin inscriptions which it contains, the only European whom I had seen in the country, an employ\u00e9 in the Telegraph, my arrival as quite an event in his life. Of carriages brings visitors from the town at a distance of 12 kilom. Italian and taverns are common; a Captain of the guards visits the Dar-el-Bey, where I was entered by the Tunisian Governor. The old buildings have been almost entirely pulled down and replaced, if not picturesque, French barracks. The remains, formerly the prison, now a camp. The troops are still in the camp there they will soon be removed to the town, a more pleasant and a healthier situation, with a general appearance of cleanliness, and the bath, which formerly struck me as so original purity.\n\nThe Chief of the Bureau Arabe, is an artist, and has collected many interesting Greek, and Numidian; and he has a copy, which shows how much the level\nof the town has been raised by the ruins of successive ages.\n\nAt the Bab-es-Souk, or market gate, something like the spring of an arch was observed quite on the ground level. He excavated round the gate outside, and he has discovered the old Roman entrance. It was a double gate; one half is still perfectly entire. The present entrance is built on the ruins of the other half, the ground level being now as high as the spring of the old arch.\n\nI slept at Ghardimaou, the extremity of the railway at present, the same night, and on the following day I proceeded to Souk Ahras; the road, if I may be allowed the expression, follows the line of railway, crossing the Medjerda twenty-three times. It is hardly practicable in fine weather, and quite impossible to travel over after rains; but the line of rail will be entirely finished and open by October next.\n\nThence I returned to Algiers by land.\n\nNote on the Marbles of Algeria and Tunis.\n\nFour years ago I made a Report\\(^1\\) on the quarries of Numidian marbles recently discovered near Kleber, in the Province of Oran, in which I stated that nowhere had I seen marbles of greater beauty or variety, and that the quantity was practically inexhaustible.\n\nImmediately after my visit I conceived the idea, which I have since successfully carried out, of decorating the English church here with this precious material. Every one who has seen the work will admit that I have not exaggerated its beauty, and regrets have constantly been expressed that the quarries should remain unworked. The proprietor, Signor Delmonte, did not care to undertake the work himself; he preferred to sell the whole mountain to a Company; but as he has failed in this, he and his sons have determined to open out the quarries on their own account, and to offer the marble for sale, ready for shipment at Oran, for 400 fr. per cubic metre. The commonest white marble is worth\n\n\\(^1\\) Consular Report, 1881, part i. p. 55.\nuld be considered cheap in London or the sum he demands for it.

Lesueur. They contain marble of various qualities, the most common being pure white, some of it adapted for statuary purposes. There is also a good deep black, a fine description of pale blue or dove colour, a small quantity of coralline rose, and a bluish crystalline stone, more nearly resembling granite than marble. True granite actually does exist, but it would not repay the cost of working it.\n\nThe coping of the quays in the new harbour of Philippeville is of large blocks of white marble from these quarries. Specimens of all the other kinds may be seen in M.

Vol. XV. p. 175.\nof those in which it is hardly possible to confine one's self to a small group; if the student wish to grasp more than one language, he soon finds that he must examine the languages of the whole continent. Two years ago, when I first turned my attention to these languages, I found myself little by little obliged to enlarge the field of my study, till I arrived at the fascinating subject of the Bushmen and their language. In this paper, however, I propose to examine the Bushmen only, and no other of all the populations of Africa.\n\nThe difficulties met with in such a study are numerous indeed, and the greatest is certainly the scanty material extant on the subject, and also the difficulty to assign such and such data to the real Bushmen. For a long time the Bushmen have been assimilated to or confounded with the Hottentots; it is only lately that more scientific travellers have carefully noticed every particularity and separated the Bushmen from the Hottentots. The difference, however, is so great between these two populations, as will be seen further on, that to place them in the same group is the same as stating that all men are of the same genus, and therefore destroying all classifications. What has also much contributed to obscure all about the Bushmen is their strange language, the acquirement of which is so difficult that it was for a long time thought impossible. The travellers coming in contact with the real Bushman could only obtain particulars at second hand, and often from those Bushmen who had, by intercourse with the Dutch, acquired a small knowledge of this European language, and had partly lost their peculiarities.\n\nThe Bushmen now hardly form a race, much less a nation; they are divided into a multitude of small tribes, scattered and isolated all over Southern Africa, having, to avoid persecution, slavery or extermination, taken refuge in the deserts, or in the rugged mountains. In every locality, though they keep remarkably to themselves, they are inevitably brought more or less in contact with other populations, and owing to occasional, not frequent intermarriages\u2014perhaps also to the admission into their community of some few runaway slaves\u2014\ngeneral intercourse, have partly modified\nties and partly acquired those of their\nrusing the relations of the travellers about\ncannot help noticing how different are their\nhey saw different tribes, and each of these\ntheir isolation and through intercourse\ns new characteristics, two facts, which\nmarkable degree this isolation, are that\ny numbering fifty, have acquired such\nties that they cannot understand each\nnt only a few miles, and that they have\nional name; they are known to us by the\nto them by their neighbours, or by names\nBoers gave them the name of Bosjesman,\nashman: the Hottentots call them Saan;\u00b9\nroa;\u00b2 the Kafirs, Abatwa, etc. The only\nbe doubtfully considered as national is\nplied to one special tribe.\ni (if we adopt the name) or Bushman\nsked.\n\ne variations above mentioned, the answer\naffirmative.

Besides, a new-born Bushman baby is not black as a new-born Bantu baby, but red, which, however, is also the case for the new-born Negro baby.\n\nThe hair is one of the most persistent racial characteristics, and in the case of the Bushman it is well marked; it is developed in tufts, as that of the Tasmanian, and has an oval transversal cut. The hair is nearly absent on the face and body.\n\nThe skull is well defined, it is round and small, the temples are wide, the eyes far from one another and slightly oblique, the cheek-bones prominent, the nose varies much, but is generally large and flat.\n\nThe body in general is well proportioned, the shoulders are broad, the arms and legs well developed, with remarkably small feet and hands.\n\nThere is a peculiarity which requires special notice. It is the enormous development of the buttocks, which gives the Hottentot his ridiculous appearance. This peculiarity, which is also given to the Bushman, does not, however, appear to be racial, as it is noticed with certainty only on those inhabiting in the vicinity of the Hottentots. The silence of travellers on the point when describing the Bushmen of other localities appears to be most significant; if all the Bushmen had everywhere this remarkable peculiarity, it would have certainly struck the observers. It is therefore probable that it appears only where the Bushmen are crossed with Hottentots.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) For the anthropological questions I follow principally Dr. Fritsch, who has published a valuable paper on the Bushman in the Transactions of the German Ethnographical Society, 1879, p. 320. See also H. H. Johnston in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute, vol. xiii. p. 452; Sir Bartle Frere, same publication, vol. xi. p. 327; E. Holub, in the same publication, vol. x. p. 6, and in his work, 'Seven Years in South Africa.' Waitz, in his Introduction to Anthropology, has gathered an enormous quantity of facts reported by travellers, but unfortunately the Hottentot and the Bushman are often confounded, so that it is difficult to draw conclusions from them.\nty found among the Bushwomen and, \nng the female Hottentots, appears to be \nis called in French le tablier \u00e9gyptien. \ntion seems to be essentially Bushman, \not specimens only due to intermixture. \nBushman, as noticed by Fritsch, place \nss; they are not like badly-cut ivory, as \nregular, and of a mother-of-pearl ap-\n\nThe Bushman appears to be, when un-\nHottentot, of small stature and brachy-\nproportioned.\n\nmore clearly the ethnographic difference \nthe neighbouring races, we must bear \nristics of the latter.

His garment consists only of a small skin. His weapons are still the spear, arrow, and bow, in their most rudimentary form. The spear is a mere branch of tree, to which is tied a piece of bone or flint; the arrow is only a reed treated in the same way. Sometimes, as often happens among savages on the border of civilized lands, an old piece of glass or iron, or a nail, is utilized as point of arrow. The arrow and spear-heads are always poisoned, to render mortal the slight wounds they inflict. He gathers no flocks, which would impede his movements, and only accepts the help of dogs as wild as himself. The Bushmen have, however, one implement\u2014a rounded stone, perforated in the middle, in which is inserted a piece of wood; with this instrument, which carries us back to the first age of man, they dig up a few edible roots growing wild in the desert. To produce fire, he still retains the primitive system of rubbing two pieces of wood\u2014another prehistoric revival.\n\nThough the Bushman has many superstitions, he has no religion, and really no idea of a divinity, unless he has acquired it from missionaries or from neighbouring tribes, and even in those cases it is evident that the Bushman repeats what he has been told without understanding it himself. But in spite of this lack of religion, he is, morally, far superior to the Bantu and the Hottentot, never being uselessly cruel, and being kind and helpful to his fellow-tribesmen. Cattle-stealing is in their eyes only a form of hunting. The Bushman is grateful and devoted to those who treat him kindly. The travellers narrate several cases of Bushmen who have shown the utmost devotion to their masters when these knew how to treat them. The Bushman has a great talent of imitation. It is related of a Bushman employed by a Boer as servant, that he used to imitate in a striking manner every one in the farm and those who visited it, though he always refused to caricature his master, who was kind to him. This talent of imitation is well illustrated by the\nleft by the Bushmen on the walls of rocks; these drawings are done with s, and the carving only with a flint representations show many degrees of striking and realistic likeness is or can there be any doubt of the sts.

But as all these texts are beyond our reach, we must make the best of the scanty materials at our disposal, hoping that one day a scholar will find his way to the treasure accumulated by Bleek, and expose it to the learned world.\n\nOur data are therefore now only the vocabulary and a few sentences given by Arbousset and Daumas in their travels,\u00b9 the vocabulary and a few sentences given by Lichtenstein in his travels,\u00b2 the few observations published by Bleek,\u00b3 a very small vocabulary published by Dr. Hahn,\u2074 and republished by Dr. F. M\u00fcller,\u2075 with another vocabulary obtained from Bleek.\u2076 The only connected text besides the above-mentioned sentences is a so-called prayer given by Arbousset and Daumas.\n\nWhat has prevented more information from being obtained about the language of the Bushmen is no doubt the difficulty for Europeans to acquire it; the abundance of gutturals, the nasalized and uncertain vowels, and above all the strange sounds called clicks, are so foreign to our ears that the first travellers and missionaries did not even attempt to master it, and summarily dismissed all inquiries, saying that the Bushmen must be taught another language to be civilized and Christianized.\u2077 One, indeed, is struck when reading their relations, how they abstained from giving a single word of Bushman, though when speaking of other populations they mix in their narrative as many African words as they can.

Grey's Library Bleek gives only bibliographic notes, but he distinguishes the Bushman's language from the Hottentot, and notes the existence of two dialects at least.\n\u2077 The same was said of the Hottentots and of the inhabitants of Terra-del-Fuego, but since then the Bible has been translated and these people converted without losing their language.\nThe most disastrous effect on the tongue intercourse the Bushmen had to use the little by little adopted foreign words or less disfigured, and some tribes native idiom; on the Boer frontier pigeon-Dutch, on the Kafir frontier a, etc. Even in the most isolated tribes language is pure. The Hottentots being contact the Bushmen were mostly and the words introduced from this quarter aduced several philologists to consider two populations as from the same, before he had collected the Bush- mentioned, stated that the relation, or San as he calls it, and Hottentot is Latin and English, and Dr. T.

For instance, for the word 'mother' we have ngo (no) in Se-roa, \u03c7oa in the Khuai or Bushman of Lichtenstein, and tau in the Khuai of Bleek given by Dr. F. M\u00fcller. The Se-roa language of the Ba-roa is the one given by Arbousset and Daumas, and called by Bleek cisi-gariepian dialect or Bumantsu; the Khuai is the language of the Bushmen living in the neighbourhood of the Koranna-Hottentots, and given by Lichtenstein. The vocabulary collected by Bleek, and published by Dr. F. M\u00fcller, belongs also to the Khuai dialect, as also the few words given by Dr. Hahn.\n\nI will now proceed to give a grammatical sketch so far as the materials at my disposal permit, and will in the transcription follow the Lepsius system as closely as possible.\n\n**Vowels.**\n\n- a nasalised \u0101, \u0113, etc.\n- e o\n- i \u016b u diphthongs au, ai, ao, etc.\n\n**Consonants.**\n\n| Explosives | Fricatives | Anticipated |\n|------------|------------|-------------|\n| Strong.

It is possible, however, that the palatized \\( n \\) found in Hottentot exists also in Bushman. In the fables, the Ichneumon, when speaking, changes the clicks into palatized sibilants and dentals, as the Tortoise changes them into labials.\n\nAs we should expect it from the small number of consonants, the clicks play an important part in the Bushman language, where they have been, indeed, developed to the number of nine. The great importance of these curious sounds, very insufficiently described in Lepsius's Alphabet, makes it advisable to give here a description of them.\n\nThe special and essential character of the clicks is that they are formed, not by expiration, but by drawing in the breath; they form, really, a pure vibration, necessarily followed by a stop before the speaker can pronounce the letter uttered in the usual way with the breath. The clicks are, besides, always placed before the initial letter; when a word contains a click in the middle, it must be a compound, so \\( \\text{tan} \\) \\( \\text{tjih} \\) 'warm' written for \\( \\text{ta}:i \\) by Lichtenstein and given by Dr. F. M\u00fcller under the forms of \\( \\text{ta}:i \\) or \\( \\text{a}:i \\), is certainly a compound of the word for 'fire' \\( \\text{tjih} \\) for \\( :i \\) in Lichtenstein and \\( i \\) in M\u00fcller, and also the word for 'child' given by Lichtenstein \\( \\text{ka}:koan \\) compound of \\( \\text{koan} \\) 'a youth,' in the Se-roa \\( \\text{kon} \\), is 'man.'\n\nThe cerebral click \\( ! \\) (confounded by Lichtenstein with the palatal \\( ; \\)) is sounded by curling the tip of the tongue and pressing it against the middle of the roof of the palate and withdrawing it suddenly and forcibly by suction.\n\nThe palatal click \\( ; \\) (\\( \\text{t}^3 \\) in Lichtenstein and \\( \\text{t}^2 \\) of Bleek) is formed like the last, but pressing the tongue against the termination of the palate at the gums.\n\nThe dental click \\( | \\) (\\( \\text{t}^1 \\) of Lichtenstein) is formed by pressing the tip of the tongue against the front teeth and withdrawing as for the others.\ner, faucal click || (t\u00b2 of Lichtenstein) is\nthe tongue against the faucal point of\ndoing the tongue practically covers\nte, as noticed by Tindal in his Nama\nague is withdrawn as usual by suction.\nclick by pressing the tongue against\nits name lateral, but among the Bush-\nbut faucal.\u00b9\n\n\u03b3 (confounded by Lichtenstein with\nlike the preceding, but by placing the\npoint of the palate.\n\nunded with the dental by Lichtenstein,\np to Bleek, and \u0398 of Bleek's report) is\nng the tongue quickly, like that of a\n\n\", noticed by Wuras and known only\nBleek, is sounded by drawing in the\neth slightly apart.

Following the order adopted by Lepsius, we have: faucal, guttural, cerebral, palatal, dental, labial; the spiro-dental corresponds to the aspirate \\( h \\), and the linguo-palatal is a kind of \\( r \\)-click or \\( l \\)-click.\n\nAs for the philological position of the clicks, it is most probable that Edwin Norris was right when he suggested that they play the same part as the tones in Chinese. It has been objected that Hottentot, which has clicks, has tones also; but the clicks are probably of Bushman origin, and have been no doubt adopted by the Hottentots in their contact with the Bushmen, as these curious sounds are strangely contagious; the Shuana, the Kafirs, the Zulus, and many other people, even the Boers, have adopted some. The existence of the clicks is not besides incompatible with that of the tones in the same language, as the former seems to indicate a modification of the beginning, and the latter of the end of the words. However, the existence of tones in the language of the Bushman is even doubtful, as Bleek and others do not mention them. As illustration of clicks taking the place of dropped letters, or compensating for their loss, may be quoted: Se-roa \\( k\u0101 \\) \u2018hand,\u2019 Khuai \\( \u0101 \\) or \\( \u014d \\).\n\nAs for the question whether the clicks are anterior to the consonants, or the consonants to the clicks, it cannot be answered for the present on account of the few specimens at our disposal.\n\nThere is one more observation to be made before leaving the alphabet. As already noticed, the vowels are more or less obscure, but in many cases the vowel must have been so weak that it has been neglected altogether in the transcription; though vowels must be inserted to make the pronunciation possible, as in the name for \u2018tortoise\u2019 \\( \u1e37r\u014di \\), and with the prefixes \\( \u1e37- \\) and \\( mm- \\) before a click, or a consonant, unless we admit vocalized consonants, as in some languages of Asia.\nr, the reader might be reminded that disposal are only three vocabularies two dialects. In Arbousset's dialect, are not represented at all; in this Lichtenstein's dialect, the Khuai, the very defective, and often we cannot meant. As far as possible, in this is restored according to the Lepsius language there are no gender, two pronouns.\n\nPersonal and possessive pronouns are ex-fixes or suffixes.\n\n| Pronoun | Plur. 1st pers. | Plur. 2nd pers. | Plur. 3rd pers. |\n|---------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| i       | si si          | u-u u          | (wanting)      |\n| en      |                |                |                |\n| \u0113       |                |                |                |\n| \u0101       |                |                |                |\n\nPlur. 1st pers. we have also sing. i, plur. se\n\nPersonal pronouns are formed with the the word for 'man' |koan.\n\n'these.'\n\n'the prefix is in for the 1st pers.\n\nPronouns are expressed by the shorter\n\nbrother.'\n\n'res are:\n\ninng by Lichtenstein).\n\n's.

However, we can see from the last three that the final particle was not always necessary. The \\( n \\) in \\( \\text{axan} \\) in Nos. 3 and 4 may express a kind of instrumental, in No. 3 it would be 'by what' (place), and in No. 4 'by what' (name). The final -si\u00e0 in No. 2 may express remoteness. In No. 4 the pronoun expressed \\( aa \\) is no doubt the accusative regimen of the verb, and in No. 6, \\( \\text{axa} \\) is perhaps for \\( \\text{axa ha} \\) 'what him;' if so, in interrogative sentences a pronoun regimen would precede the verb. The word \\( \\text{tire} \\), which in No. 7 seems to take the place of the initial vowel \\( a \\) of the interrogative, is not found otherwise, so its real strength cannot be detected.\n\n**Numerals.**\u2014Bushmen not possessing anything do not want any numerals. When they wish to express a number, they merely raise as many fingers. In the Khuai dialect we have only \\( \\text{noi} \\) 'one,' \\( \\text{iu} \\) 'two,' for 'three' \\( \\text{noaya} \\) 'many' is used. The Se-roa dialect appears to be better off, and the numerals go up to 'four,' and, as in the Polynesian languages, the numeral is always preceded by a word:\n\n- **one** te a noa.\n- **two** te iu.\n- **three** te nuene.\n- **four** te nkeo.\n- **many** te a gabe.\n\nThe word \\( \\text{te} \\) is not found in any other sentence or expres-\nknow its meaning, but it may perhaps\nin Khuai is \\(a\\); if the supposition is\nbe \u2018finger is one,\u2019 \\(a\\) being the Se-roa\nbe.\u2019 \u2018Many\u2019 \\(te a gabe\\) might be \u2018the\nt this is a mere supposition, as \\(gabe\\) also\nexpressions.\n\nves.\u2014The adjectives do not form a special\nouns placed in apposition, we therefore\n\nthere is no gender in the words: beings\nften expressed by different words:\n\napply to both sexes the distinction is\nle\u2019 or \u2018female\u2019:\n\ndoubt the same as \\(kei\\) \u2018people,\u2019 and \\(aiti\\)\n\\(aiti\\) \u2018a female.\u2019 The click is dropped,\ntwo words form a compound so homo-\nconsidered to form only one word,\nbeing admitted in the middle must be\n\nhumas\u2019s vocabulary is so defectively\nto make out the real words meant in\n\nn.\u2019\n\nness.\u2019\n\nlion\u2019s male\u2019 and \u2018lion\u2019s female.\u2019 \u2018Lion\u2019\nding to Bleek, and \\(jka\\) according to\n\\(koe\\) seems to be the Se-roa form, the\nthe transcribers. \\(ka\\) is the mark of\nerefore \u2018male\u2019 and \\(nte\\) \u2018female,\u2019 re-\n\n\\(lku\\) goui, \u2018woman\u2019 \\(lku\\) \\(ayi\\), which seem to be\nhuman being,\u2019 and an adjective.\nlated to \u1e29ei and |aii, as ai\u0331h and ai\u0331ti of the Khun\u00ec expressions.\n\nIn the Se-roa vocabulary we find also:\n\nkuane ka oga \u2018bull.\nka oga \u2018cow\u2019\u2014\n\nwhich must be incorrect: kuane may be however the Se-roa word for \u2018cattle\u2019 or \u2018ox\u2019 in general, without reference to the gender, as we have in Khuai jkau for \u2018buffalo\u2019: kuane ka oga would be then \u2018buffalo\u2019s male\u2019\u2014the second expression ka oga for \u2018cow\u2019 must be a mistranscription. The two following expressions in Se-roa\n\nklir-ea \u2018springbock,\u2019\nkoli-nte \u2018blessbock,\u2019\n\ngive us the form without the particle: ea\u2014the Khuai ai\u0331h \u2018malo\u2019 and nte=ai\u0331ti \u2018female.\u2019\n\nIt must be mentioned that Bleek said in his report that the Bushman\u2019s language distinguished perhaps at one time the genders, as the Hottentot: this is suggested to him by the fact that in the fables certain animals are made to marry others, and he supposes that, as in French, certain genders are specially applied to certain animals and used as common, as in the words girafe, hy\u00e8ne, li\u00e8vre, etc., which are always the same one gender, even when spoken of male or female. In French, as in Bushman, one must, to express the sex, say, le male de la girafe, le male de la hy\u00e8ne, etc. This supposition of Bleek\u00b9 has been adopted by Dr. Hahn and Dr. F. M\u00fcller, who suppose Khuai to be a decayed Hottentot dialect. We must remember, however, that in Hottentot the genders are not what they are in the classic tongues. The masculine, feminine, and common gender are always carefully distinguished, and do not answer to our masculine, feminine, and neuter; we do not find masculine applied to female, as in the French virago, or neuter to female as in the German Weib, or feminine to neuter as in the English ship. In the Bushman\u2019s language it seems to me that there never was any gender, but that, as in Turk and Akkadian, when it was\n\n\u00b9 Second report, \u201cA Short Account of Bushman Folklore, Cape Town, 1875.\u201d\nit, this was done by means of the ; if there is a tendency at all to no doubt due to a long intercourse ie sex-denoting Hottentot, but as far documents we possess, this supposed l.\n\nplural is, by its irregularity, one of res of the Khuai dialect.

however, the imperative is generally placed at the beginning:\n\n\\(\\text{da teeku}\\) 'give me tobacco.'\n\nIn the other cases the verb or the adjective used as predicate is placed at the end, and the subject at the beginning, when emphatically expressed:\n\n\\(\\text{at kossi kainsi}\\) 'thou wilt come again.'\n\n\\(\\text{hau hauin an letini}\\) 'this man (is) not good.'\n\n\\(\\text{winkossi a gani}\\) 'to-morrow thou comest.'\n\n\\(\\text{ku in ainta}\\) 'there I come.'\n\nIn the Se-roa dialect the same order is generally observed, but there are some sentences where the verb is at the beginning, and it seems to be the rule for the auxiliary \\(\\text{tania}\\):\n\n\\(\\text{sak ke ke}\\) 'blow the fire.'\n\n\\(\\text{ka ki}\\) 'to kill a man.'\n\n\\(\\text{ka ki kuila}\\) 'filled fire all,' i.e. 'the fire is all filled (with smoke).'\n\n\\(\\text{etana e kyu koba hu}\\) 'we like our stomach filled [with] food.'\n\n\\(\\text{ka ki ke}\\) 'I speak the truth.'\nns.\u2014It has been wrongly asserted that Bushman had no formatives; with the at our disposal it is difficult often to i, but even in these few words the exis- is evident. We have already quoted ta|i re,' where ta seems a formative prefix, me formative written te in teteini 'good,' we have no doubt a formative suffix, as ki-ya 'red,' joaya 'many,' \u016bi-ya 'big'; last word the suffix ya is changed to ta; ti forms adjectives or appellatives: d-ke on,' ||kana-ki 'bad.' Besides ta we have ed after the initial click: \u016b-ka 'dead,' he same formatives are found in Se-roa: form ia, and exclusively after a nasal, z (cf. the Khuai |ko\u0129n) 'dog,' keu\u0129-ia 'a 's egg,' sebe-ke 'iron.'

Bleek, in it dialectal differences are noticed in whom he gathered the tales now in\n\nms to form diminutives: gnu 'a gnu,' ngai 'the\nCape Town; and, as we have already noticed, the few words we possess differ between themselves, even when collected in the same localities from two different persons. This very fact makes this language precious for the philologist, as he could notice in a small area wonderful changes, and, taking into account all the surrounding influences, detect the real and genuine national words; we can already, with the little we possess, notice curious changes. The clicks, for instance, are not immutable, but vary as much as the other elements of the language. The palatal \\( j \\) and the cerebral \\( ! \\) are easily interchanged, and might be considered as developments of the same original, or one as the offshoot of the other: the same may be said of the faucal (lateral) and the guttural. We notice, also, changes between clicks and consonants, as the already-quoted \\( |a \\) for \\( ta \\). Bleek, in his report, notices that in the tales collected by him the tortoise changes clicks in labials, the ichneumon uses instead palatals, the jackal replaces the labial click \\( [] \\) by the linguo-palatal \\( [] \\), and the moon, the hare, and the anteater, use \"a most unpronounceable click.\" Even in the two vocabularies we possess, changes of clicks are noticeable, \\( tsun \\) 'thing,' given by Dr. Hahn, is \\( ||soin \\) in Lichtenstein, and \\( tsaxe \\) 'eye,' becomes \\( |sagu \\); for 'wood' Bleek gives \\( []hoki \\), Dr. Hahn \\( ihoggen \\), and Lichtenstein \\( |hauki \\), etc.\\(^1\\) The consonantal changes are not less numerous and interesting. Bleek says that in the fables the blue crane adds 'tt' to the end of the first syllable of almost every word.' For 'nose' Bleek gives \\( tu \\), Dr. Hahn and Lichtenstein \\( nudu \\), and Arbousset \\( nuen \\); for 'lion' Bleek gives \\( ||ka \\), Lichtenstein \\( |k\u00e4n \\), and Arbousset \\( koei \\). Sometimes words entirely different have been adopted: for 'arrow' Bleek gives \\( |kara \\), Lichtenstein \\( |noa \\), and Arbousset \\( tloatoa \\). As for the peculiar changes which Bleek notices in the Bushman's fables collected by him, they may be compared to the peculiar accent attributed to countrymen and foreigners, or the representation in writing of lisping and\n\n\\(^1\\) From the words for 'one' and 'two' \\( !lozi \\) and \\( !u \\) in Khuai and \\( !loa \\) and \\( !w \\) in Se-roa, it would seem that the click \\( ! \\) changes regularly in gutturo-nasal \\( \\# \\) from one dialect to the other.\nin the idea of the Bushmen, the spoke, had each a peculiar accent. The als' languages or dialects would be very ilologist.\n\nire.\u2014As before stated, the connected texts unfortunately very few, and consist only in ed by Lichtenstein in the Khuai dialect, -roa dialect published by Arbousset and called prayer of four sentences, and one . This is nothing compared to the im- cted by Bleek of fables, tales, histories, ythological stories, genealogies, etc., all and translated. This collection forms of 3600 pages, in two columns. These usively filled with Bushman literature, , the translation of the native pieces in ies, also, in Dutch, and, in the case of transcription is also given in ordinary eces are, besides, entered in several\n\nthe catalogue given by Bleek will give llection.

The last section contains lists of names of animals and insects, extensive vocabularies, and sentences in several dialects.\n\nFrom this short summary we readily understand the importance of the collection, and must regret that nothing of it has been yet published. Just before his death, Bleek intended to appeal to the European learned world for support to enable him to pursue his researches and publish their result. The appeal was made in the name of his widow by his sister-in-law, Miss Lucy Lloyd, under the date of 18th of September, 1875, but does not appear to have met with any response.\n\nIt must be mentioned that doubts have been raised as to the genuineness of the tales recited by the Bushmen to Bleek. Even were these warranted, the circumstance would not take away the philological importance of the texts: but they really seem to have little foundation, as we can hardly believe that the Bushmen would have invented the stories with the curious animals' clicks, and, the other populations not being able to pronounce them, it is not likely that the tales were theirs.\n\nRelationship of the Bushman.\u2014It may be asked, what is the Bushman, what is his position in regard to the other tribes and among the human family, and whether he is a last and isolated specimen of an extinct race? It has been asserted by some that the Bushmen were the result of a mixture of all the runaway slaves, and by others that they were the broken remnants of a degraded and decayed population. Against these two assumptions Dr. Fritsch protests rightly, remarking that the Bushmen have none of the characters which would warrant such suppositions. He observes, with great acuteness, that the Bushmen love their savage life, and prefer it to the comfort of civilization; it is where they have accepted in a certain measure this civilization that they can be said to be decayed. At a period, very early it may be, the Bushmen have found a modus vivendi, and, being satisfied with it, neither tried nor\n\n1 In his excellent paper quoted above.\nimprove it. It is not the only example\nwhich, arrived at a certain degree of civiliza-\ntion, being quite satisfied with that stage\nas the best attainment. Unfortunately\nthe area which the Bushman chose to remain\nin enable him to resist the pressure of\nthe area he covered formerly was much\nlarger over regions now exclusively occupied\nby Bantu; how far it extended in the\nmeans of knowing, but we have some\nidea that the Bushman race occupied at one\nof the African continent.\n\nstrange to say, the Bushman offers all\nthe Nigritos, especially of those of the\nrace cranial similarity has already been\nnoted, though he explains it by supposing\nthat they have been arrested in their develop-\nment, and preserve an infantile character.\nThis confined to the skull, but extends to\nother characteristics we have enumerated\u2014colour of\nthe skin of the hair, absence of hair on the\nlimbs, smallness of the extremities, and\nother features.\n\nThe population with which the Bushmen\nare The central part of Africa is not yet\nable us to answer this question with\ncertainty, however, a race, now nearly extinct\nwhich shows many of the same characteristics\nas the Egyptian race of the first dynasties. Of\ncourse it would be hard to say that the Bushmen are the\nEgyptians, or that the Egyptians were\nBushman. It may be safely said that both populations\n\nOn the osteology and affinities of the natives of the\ncontinent of Africa, Presidential Address of the Anthropol. Inst. vol. ix. p. 103; Presidential\nAddress of Dr. Mann, same publication, vol. xii. p. 74 et seq.\n\nof Africa, however, give the name of Bushmen to\nall the inhabitants of the Continent. Are they the same as our Bush-\nmen? The utterances of Dr. Livingstone might, however,\ncame from the same primitive stock and have been modified by crossing with other races, and many other causes. The Bushmen, like the Egyptians, have an exclusive natural graphic power, and, as a special physical characteristic, the tablier \u00e9gyptien. I, however, say that the Bushmen do not descend from the Egyptians, but only from the same race\u2014a kind of Nigritoide population. The Bushmen certainly never knew anything of Egyptian civilization, though some might be tempted to say they did; it is probable that they separated when still in a savage state, or rather that at that early period a group, separated and mixed with another race, formed the Egyptian race. It is now admitted by many that the mixed races are those which show the greatest aptitudes. What makes the supposition of such relationship less improbable is that the primitive home of the Egyptians appears to have been at the south of the equator, hence they gradually pushed northwards. The other tribes of this Nigritoide race remained probably in a state of barbarism, or adopted the lowest degree of community: they were pushed and pressed everywhere by all the populations of higher social organization, the ancestors of the Bushmen were thrown on the Hottentot population, whether or not this was indigenous or extraneous\u2014in their tales the Bushmen always speak of a previous population inhabiting the country\u2014and it is no doubt the inevitable infusion of Hottentot blood which has given them the few characteristics they have in common.\n\nIt may be said that in my statements there are many assumptions difficult to prove. I would, however, remark that they are rather inferences than conclusions, and that I have reached them through a long and slow process. Having no decided opinion, at first I examined carefully the opinions of every scholar, philologist, or traveller, and in many cases I stopped for awhile, accepting one of them, which I was nevertheless obliged to reject on further examination. Such may be\n\n1 This is the simplest explanation of the Egyptian tradition preserved in the classics, that, formerly, the sun used to rise at the right and set at the left; there are, besides, other evidences of the Austral origin of the Egyptians.\nown conclusions, but if this paper has aroused the interest of scholars in literature, and to induce one philosophical library and give to the world a full collection by Bleek, I shall be pleased.\n\nI only wish that circumstances would allow me to examine the treasure of Cape Town, continue the interesting study of language.\n\nTo note 5, page 59 ante. Since the publication of the following note from our Hon. Secretary, it has been communicated to me: \"Dr. F. Bleek has in the press a grammar of the Khoikhoi language.\" I regret not to have had the opportunity, as the above-named gentleman has so much data to work on, and a grammar of his language would not fail to add much to our knowledge of many valuable observations.\nART. IV.\u2014Inscriptions at Cairo and the Burju-z Zafar. By Henry C. Kay, M.R.A.S.\n\nA former number of this Journal (Vol. XIX. Part 2) contained a short account of the three monumental gates of Cairo, the chief, indeed almost the only, remaining memorials of the celebrated Fatimite Khalifate of Egypt. It included a copy of the Cufic inscription sculptured on the frieze of the gate, known by the name of Bab en Na\u1e63r, as far as I had then succeeded in reading it.\n\nOn a subsequent visit to Egypt, I applied to the local authorities for permission to put up a light scaffolding, admitting of a closer examination of the inscription. This was courteously granted, and enabled me to decipher the missing portions with which, until then, all my attempts had been completely baffled. Near inspection revealed the reason of the difficulty. The lettering was perfectly visible, but it was choked and disfigured by several layers of whitewash, applied at successive but unknown periods. There were traces to show that one of these layers had been a light sky-blue in colour, but the outer one had assumed a dark grey, so precisely the colour of the stone of which the gate is built, that seen from the ground below, its existence could hardly be suspected.\ncomplete, and I think I may venture to the inscription:\n\n\u0628\u0639\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u062d\u0627\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0646\u062a\u0634\u0627\n\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u064a\u0637 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0647\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\n\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0648\u0633\u064a\u062f\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0646\u0635\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0647\n\u0648\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0647\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0631\u0645\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\n\u0633\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0641\u0644 \u0642\u0636\u0627\u0629 \u0627\n\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0645\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062c\u0645 \u0628\u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0646\u0635\u0631\u0649 \u0639\u0636\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\n\u0628\u0642\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0645\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u062f\u0627\u0645 \u0642\u062f\u0631\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0643\n\u0628\u062d\u0633 \u062a\u062f\u0628\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0645 (\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0645) \u0627\u064a\u0627\u0645\n\u0648\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0648\u0627\u0628\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u062b\u0648\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0631\u0636\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0648\u0637\u0644\u0628 \u0641\n\u0643\u0631\u0633\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0630\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u062c\u064a\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\n\u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645 \u0633\u0646\u0629 \u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0631\u0628\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0626\u0647\n\nabout with the glory of God, the most\nused for the defence of the walls, this gate\n(themselves) that encircle Al K\u0101hirah the\n'may God protect it), were erected by the\nnd Master the Imam Al Mustansir-billah,\nDivine glory be upon him, on his fathers\nhis noble offspring), (by) the illustrious\nArmies, Sword of Islam, Defender of the\nudges of the Muslims, and Guide of the\nAbu-l Nijmi Badru-l Mustansiry.

The characters are beautifully formed, and its undoubted date adds to its caligraphic and artistic interest. Through the care of Mr. Stanley Lane-Poole, a plaster cast of a portion is now in the South Kensington Museum.\n\nOn a visit, shortly afterwards, to the mosque and tomb of Sayyidah Nafisah, on the south of Cairo, I observed what seemed to be portions of a marble slab, with the remains of a Cufic inscription, which attracted my attention owing to their close resemblance to the inscription over Bab en Na\u1e63r. The slab had been cut up into slips, which are imbedded in mortar in the walls of the vestibule, in various positions, and some upside down. A reference to Al Makrizi\u2019s account of the mausoleum (vol. ii. p. 441) shows that in his days (A.D. 1359\u20131442) a marble slab existed over the gate with an inscription, of which he gives a full copy, and which is almost identically the same as that over Bab en Na\u1e63r. Apart from some slight verbal variations, for which the copyists of Makrizi\u2019s MS. are, it may be, chiefly responsible, the difference between the two is confined to the following points.\n\nThe inscription over the mausoleum, Makrizi tells us, commenced with the Bismillah, and proceeded as follows:\n\n\u0646\u0635\u0631\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0641\u062a\u062d \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0628 \u0644\u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0645\u0639\u0630 \u0623\u0628\u064a \u062a\u064a\u0645\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0646\u0635\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0645\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0635\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0628\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0647\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\n\nAssistance (and victory) from God, and speedy conquest unto the favoured servant of God, Ma\u2018add Abu Tam\u012bm, the Im\u0101m al Mustan\u1e63ir-billah, Prince of the Faithful.

The first mausoleum over her grave was built by 'Obayd Allah ibn es Sari, governor of Egypt from A.H. 206 to 211.\n\nBefore concluding, I will allow myself to offer some brief remarks on that archaeological puzzle, the Burju-z Zafar. The name is popularly applied to a line of ruined walls and bastions, on the eastern side of Cairo, at but a short distance from Bab en Nasr, but it belongs more properly to the curiously-constructed tower at the north-east angle. The remains inclose a piece of ground which may at one time have formed part of the city, but which is now covered with heaps of rubbish, and presents a most desolate aspect.\n\nThe fortifications are well built, and the north-eastern tower in particular, with its domed octagonal hall, simple, but not altogether devoid of ornament, may at once be recognized as the work of an able and skilful architect. In style and appearance, but especially in its passages, it resembles Bab en Nasr and its vaulted staircases. But the theory that both constructions owe their existence to the same builder, or at least to the same period, seems excluded by the distinct and sufficiently authenticated statement of Al Makrizi and other historians, to the effect that the walls with which Badr al Jam\u00e2li encircled the city were of crude brick, whilst the abandoned line of works consist of solid stone masonry. On the other hand, they greatly differ in appearance from the stone walls known to have been built by Saladin. No inscriptions are to be found, excepting the single word \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, in a style of characters which affords no clue to a date. Nor do any local traditions throw any light upon the subject. But Al Makrizi has the following passage (vol. i. p. 380), which must doubtless refer to these remains:\nwere surrounded by a ditch. It was com-\nit\u00fbh, in the direction of Al Ma\u1e33s, in Mu-\nd likewise on the eastern side, extending\nen Na\u1e63r to Bab al Barkiyah, and beyond\nmaining traces of the ditch.

Ni\u1e63\u0101\u1e33 signifies a belt,\nThe latter passage must of course refer to the entire walls of the city. But Makrizi's remarks seem to indicate that he regarded the deserted portion as part of Saladin's work. The reason for their having been abandoned may perhaps be found in the fact that they are completely commanded by the high ground in front, which in one part advances so close to the line of works that it may almost be said to overhang them. But this, it is true, still leaves us to seek an explanation of how they ever came to be built in such a situation. A description of the Burju-z Zafar, with carefully executed plans, have been published by Professor Hayter Lewis, in the Journal of the British Archaeological Association, 1882.\n\nThe name, as popularly pronounced, Burju-z Zafar, \u0628\u0631\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0641\u0632\u0627\u0641, is correctly translated Tower of Filth, an extraordinary denomination, which it is hardly necessary to say cannot be the original one. Nor, it must be added, is there anything particularly appropriate in it. The place is remote from all habitation, and, in point of cleanliness, loses nothing by comparison with any other spot in or near Cairo. I think it exceedingly probable that we have to deal with a corruption of the word \u0638\u0641\u0631 Zafar, triumph or victory, and that the correct rendering is \u0628\u0631\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0638\u0641\u0631 the Tower of Victory. This is likewise the name of the Castle of the Pharos at Alexandria, built by Sultan Kait Bey (A.D. 1468\u201396), and Makrizi tells us (vol. i. p. 384) that one of the halls or pavilions of the Great Eastern Palace of Cairo, which stood at no great distance from the walls, bore the name of \u0642\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0638\u0641\u0631, the Palace of Victory.\n\nand also power or might. 'Akllah is applied to a woman kept in a state of seclusion, or to a jewel of great value; but the radical form 'Ak signifies a fortress or place of safety. Mi'am signifies the wrist, and the verb 'ayma means to protect or defend or to seek refuge, whilst 'Asimah, from the same root, is used to signify a city. Sivur, a bracelet, is, according to the author of the T\u00e2j al 'Ar\u00fbs, borrowed from the Persian dastavur, but as an Arabic word it is classed as belonging to the same root as sur, plur. asw\u00fbr, the walls of a city.\nfrom the Arabic.

There appear to be different readings of these celebrated verses, and I was indebted to Faris Shidiak, the translator of the Bible and Prayer Book into Arabic, for two verses which, he assured me, belong to the poem, though not found in either of the texts referred to. I have not hesitated to incorporate them in the text and in my paraphrase, for they are so completely in the spirit of the others, that I cannot but think they originally formed part of, and ought never to have been separated from, the rest of the poem.

VI.\u2014Discovery of Caves on the Murghab. By Captains de Laesso\u00eb and the Hon. M. G. Talbot, R.E. With Notes by William Simpson, R.I., F.R.G.S., Hon. Assoc. R.I.B.A.\n\n(Forwarded through the late Mr. W. S. W. Vaux, Secretary R.A.S.)\n\nIn February last, Captain F. de Laesso\u00eb, who is attached as one of the Political Officers with the Afghan Boundary Commission, discovered an important group of caves at Penjdeh, and sent me a plan of them, which is here given; and with it the following letter, which contains an account of the discovery.\n\nPenjdeh, 27th February, 1885.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Simpson,\u2014\nThere are a large number of caves at Penjdeh, but as a rule these caves consist of only one or two rooms, and it took a long time to discover and clear out the large group, of which I send you a rough plan.\u00b9 I have no drawing materials here, and I must ask you to excuse the manner in which it is done.\n\nOn a high hill in the range on the right bank of the Murghab the sandstone comes to the surface, and the cave is cut out in this rock, which at the time of excavation must have presented on the outside an almost vertical scarp; at present the outer layer has crumbled away, and the cliff has become a steep sandy slope. The group consists of a central vaulted passage 150 feet long by 9 feet wide, and about\n\n\u00b9 This plan, although bearing a resemblance to the one which appeared in the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society, is not a copy, but is reproduced from a drawing by Captain de Laesso\u00eb, made when he first discovered the caves in February last, as the date of the letter to Mr. Simpson shows.\nPLAN OF YAKI DESHIK CAVES, PENJDEH ON THE MURGHAB.\n\nDrawn by Capt.

Central room has 1 vault.\nthe pointed vault (see Pl. I. Fig. 1). They are about 4 feet long, 2\u00bd feet wide, and 4 feet high to rooms on both sides. These cells make the main passage, and are uniformly pointed. Walls and roofs are everywhere finely pointed, but not polished, and with no trace of ornamentation is attempted in some of the cells, walls being divided into 4\u20136 squares, and is cut about an inch deeper than square. The rooms have been provided with doors; the holes for wooden pegs at each end of a cross stick at the top are clearly visible. There is a hole at the left side of each door, evidently intended to put in his arm for the purpose of opening them, or evidently shut from within with a keyhole opening with a wooden key. This method is used in certain parts of Persia. Every cell (except Nos. XIV. and XVI., which are closed) (see Pl. I. Fig. 1), is provided with a well, 3 feet in diameter and 8 to 10 feet deep. They are quite empty, with the exception of a black dust (quite different from the usual black dust, such as would have been left behind by water, for a long time filled with water from the river. One well was entirely filled with compacted earth, evidently brought up on the surface, but without resulting in any damage. The staircases shown in the plan lead to the upper cells, and are roughly cut. In these rooms is a layer of brown dust, evidently decayed vegetation, sufficient to indicate that they were store rooms. VIIIb. has cells separated from the main border of rock, 1 foot high in the middle, and 3 feet ends, something like Fig. 2 (See Pl.\n\nIn general, the vaults are all pointed (see Pl. I. Fig. 1), except in a well-room, and an upper-room (not described afterwards). The beginning\nand the top of all vaults are marked by straight lines 2 inches deep and the same in breadth.\n\nThe staircase g leads to a suite of those large upper rooms, which are all carefully excavated. The central room is in the form of a cross, the central room being flat and round, while the four aisles have pointed vaults (see Pl. I. Fig. 3). a is a round excavation, marking the keystone of the vault. The two rooms adjoining this central cruciform chamber (see general plan of caves) are on a lower level; the one on the north being 5 feet below. The communications to these rooms are by roughly cut round apertures, large enough only for a man to pass through, and they have evidently been much used, as the surface is quite smooth and polished.\n\nI found a bag with one gold and about 100 silver coins, all from the eighth and ninth centuries; but this bag was found in the deposit very near the entrance, and before the floor of the vault had been come to. It seems to me clearly proved that the bag had been hidden there at a time when the caves had long been disused and the entrance already partly filled up. I suppose this money to have belonged to some inhabitant of a large ruined town situated below the hill with the caves. This town is about five miles long and one to two miles broad; it was brick built, and evidently abandoned in a hurry, as I find a quantity of copper utensils of all kinds, as well as a considerable number of copper coins, and at times gold and silver ones, wherever I dig. I hope a collection of these things will throw some light on the history of the town.\n\nI shall be glad to answer questions, or to have any suggestions regarding future work. Yours sincerely,\n\nF. de Laesso\u00eb.\nremarks on this very remarkable group by Captain de Laesso\u00eb, I shall give some view in the same region. I accompanied last winter to the Afghan Frontier, and for ancient remains, particularly of any to the Buddhist period, but as mud or to have been at all times the principal that part of the world, nothing is left the site of old towns. Excavations into et be productive of results. Coins and ups the foundations of buildings\u2014may all that may be expected. Owing to e sandstone rock, which is peculiar to ri Rud and the Murghab, we travelled ve been excavated in it have, at least in tions of them, suffered much from decay. caves which came under my notice was f the Heri Rud, opposite Dowlutabad, ten miles to the south of Sarakhs. ne scarp, about a quarter or half a mile lating ground sinks finally down into of Central Asia.

It was not that Captain de Laesso\u00eb was there for\nsome time, and, as he has a knowledge of the Turkoman language, he was able to talk to the people, and thus got on the trail of the important discovery he has made. At Bala Murghab, Captain the Hon. M. G. Talbot, R.E., who is on the Survey Department of the Afghan Boundary Commission, discovered a small group of two caves. These are in the low hills on the left bank of the river, and not above a mile from where our winter camp stood; the ascent in this case was so difficult that I deemed it wise not to make the attempt. Captain Talbot managed to get up, and made a plan with measurements, and gave me a copy of it, which is here given (see Pl. II. Fig. 1). The two caves were on the same level, but the front had through the action of time crumbled away. Below them there had been another very small cave, a few feet only of it was remaining, which presented a pointed arch, similar to that given in the section of those above (see Pl. II. Fig. 2).\n\nJust before leaving Bala Murghab we heard of another group of caves a few miles lower down on the left bank of the river, but we failed to visit them. I understand that they were in a very decayed state. Captain de Lasso\u00eb was told of some caves near Meruchak; and at Penjdeh the caves are numerous, he mentions a group called Besh Deshik (Delik?), which means 'Five Holes,' Yaki Denhik, the place he explored, meaning 'Two Holes.' He also heard of caves at a place called Gharebil, in the Chol or desert, about fifty miles to the east of Penjdeh. These statements will show that excavated caves are plentiful in the region. Our time was short, and the extent of our movements were very limited; had it been otherwise, I have little doubt, based on our slight experience, that a great many more would have been found. I have a strong presumption that many rock-cut caves exist, and if we had been able to extend our investigations among the higher slopes of the Koh-i-Baba range, there need be little doubt but many more would have been discovered. Our knowledge is all but limited to the magnificent city of caverns at Bamian, and although there is not likely to be another group like it, we may be certain that it is not the\nES AT BALA MURGHAB.\n\nat intervals, three or four of them in the larger cave.\n\n\"Dev Kan,\" or Dug by the Spirits or Devas.\n\npt. The Hon. M. G. Talbot, E.\naves will be found when the country ed. Ferrier mentions some caves he led Singlak, high up in the Koh-i-Baba, ces of the Murghab. The following, seems to confirm this; he says: \"After Balkh for seven days, on the mountains consist of villages closely built. In s of religious, and others who have re- d. I next came to the city of Herat, st inhabited city in Khorasan.\"\u2014Ibn Translation, p. 94. This journey from along the very district here referred to; just possibly refer to the 'cells' of ; but the greater probability is that he would not be in such a decayed con- low. Mr. Finn told me he has heard caves, with pillars and inscriptions, within the Persian frontier\u2014which nd he has promised to send me an these statements contain all that I have rding the rock-cut caves in the northern\n\nin of these caves, I think there can be they are Buddhist. Hiouen-Thsang about the places he passed through in o India, and on his return, from which ism had extended beyond the Hindu nissus. At Balkh, which is not much east of the Murghab, he found about 3000 monks. Among the relics of containing a tooth, a portion of hair, r-nails, the robe, the staff, the broom, men who, according to the legend, from Buddha, when he was in the , were at the same time instructed re- stupas, and on their return to Balkh rected, and Hiouen-Thsang states that ch were raised in honour of the Law i.]\nof Buddha. As we know that stupas were erected before the time of Buddha, those at Balkh could not have been the primitive models; but we may conclude from the legend the high probability that these monuments at Balkh were constructed in imitation of those in India. If the stupas were built in imitation of Indian ones, we have greater reason to believe that caves would be excavated under similar motives. As Balkh was thus evidently a great stronghold of the religion of Buddha, it gives us every reason to believe that Buddhism would not be confined to that town, but extended, at least, along the whole of what is now known as Afghan Turkestan. The Chinese pilgrim unfortunately did not pass along this country, so we are without information about it; he only states that there was a stupa 70 li to the west of Balkh. On his return journey he passed through Badakshan, and found convents in that direction. With such information before us, we may assume as all but certain that Buddhism existed westward along the northern slopes of the Koh-i-Baba range. This pilgrim states that there were convents and monks in Persia at the time of his journey\u2014early part of the seventh century; but as the frontier of that country was not likely to be near the Heri Rud, this information does not help us much.\n\nThe Bamian caves are to my mind a very strong evidence that those on the Murghab belonged to the same faith. Large cities imply the existence of towns and villages; and the extensive group at Bamian, which we know were Buddhist, were not likely to be the only ones in that region.\n\nI have here dwelt somewhat particularly on what may be called the circumstantial evidence regarding the character of the newly-discovered caves, because as yet our knowledge of them is too small to speak with certainty from the character of the caves themselves. No sculptures, nor paintings, have been found to help us as data; in the Bala Murghab caves there are a couple of representations scratched on the wall (see Pl. II. Figs. 3 and 4), but they seem to represent houses or buildings of some kind; the form and arrangement of the caves are somewhat different from\nknow to be Buddhist. A few years\nearlier to the Royal Asiatic Society on the\nAfghanistan; by means of the drawings\nit will be seen that the caves of the\nwere most probably copied from the early\nat Buddha Gaya. Among them was\nit was an evident imitation of one of the\nWestern India. We are all familiar with\na child to copy a good drawing, and such\ncave as a replica.

Roy. As. Soc. Vol. XIV, Part 3\nfound in the Jellalabad valley. This was opposite the junction of the Surkhab with the Kabul river, which may be called the Pheel Khana caves; in Vol. XIV. Pl. 4 of the Journal of this Society a plan of them will be found. This particular group of caves, which form part of a larger group, are known at the present day as the 'Bazaar,' from a long connecting tunnel by which they are approached. The caves in this case had their fronts opening out through a high scarp overlooking the Kabul river, and the tunnel was cut through the rock behind, each cave having a doorway from it; but the tunnel here had another object to serve, which was the real motive of its construction. At the extremity of the caves is a large niche in the scarp overlooking the river, in which there was no doubt a gigantic Dhyana Buddha, it may have been about 30 feet high. The tunnel leads towards this niche, where by means of a terrace cut in the rock, of which slight vestiges only remain, worshippers could pass round to the statue and perform their devotions in front of it. As the Pheel Khana caves must have been a remarkable group, with a celebrity in the regions round; for I believe that in addition to the caves there were built viharas on the hills above them, as well as a number of large stupas\u2014the ruined remains of a very fine one still exist\u2014the fame of such a spot must have spread, and I take it that the Yaki Deshik group had, as a motive for its construction, to have an equally attractive spot on the Murghab. There is a niche at the end of the long gallery at Yaki Deshik, which would no doubt contain a figure of Buddha at one time. It must be understood that no assumption of certainty is entertained in what is here said, for until we receive details of other caves in the region, and more particularly of the Bamian caves, to give us a broader basis of knowledge, all speculation must be tentative.\n\nIt will be noticed that, although there would be a small amount of light towards the outward end of the long gallery of the Yaki Deshik group, the chambers leading from it would all be in complete darkness. This must have necessitated the constant use of lamps. Many of the cells of the\nthe western side of India are very dark, was some glimmer of light which could remember any evidence that the caves of them. In the Tibetan monasteries, which monk's cells have doors. The well in each or feature which is new. At Ajunta the low valley with a stream of water; and I section of noticing a channel which brought some point higher up, so that it ran past of some of the caves. At Penjdeh the distance from the river, and hence the ins of keeping a supply of water, which carried up to them.

Captain de Lasso\u00eb describes the apertures of some upper chambers at Penjdeh as being similarly narrow and difficult of access. Security from attack in times of danger may have been the motive, otherwise it is difficult to explain for what object these passages were thus made.\n\nThe interest attaching to these caves results from their giving us the first knowledge we have received of monuments of Buddhism from a new region; and it is to be hoped that it will not be the last. Before leaving the Afghan frontier I talked to the officers of the Survey Department to keep a look out for caves and other remains, and I believe they will do their best to send accounts of anything they may chance to discover. When at Bala Murghab, being comparatively near to Bamian, I was anxious to visit that place. My plan was to go east to Balkh, and then pass on to India by Bamian. Sir Peter Lumsden, who knew my wishes in this matter, was desirous to assist, and most kindly consulted the Afghan authorities to give me permission, but unfortunately they were not favourable to the proposal, and reluctantly I had to abandon the idea. Whether they thought of danger to myself in such a journey, or had political motives in view, I cannot say; but I deeply regret their opposition to my plans. However, I trust that the time is not far distant when some one will be able to send us drawings of that wonderful spot, and its colossal figures and caves, which, we ought to expect, will throw considerable light on Buddhism as it existed in that part of the world.\nAlchemist.

The French Consul at Tabriz has recently been able to obtain some short biographical notes concerning both the original author and his Persian translator. These notes Monsieur Barbier de Meynard has inserted in his preface, and we take the liberty of transcribing them in this place.\n\nMirza Fath-'Ali, the author, appears by his name of \"Akhund-z\u00e2deh,\" to have been the son of a village Mulla or Domine, of the Caspian province of Darbend. He enlisted in the Russian army of the Caucasus, and ultimately worked his way up to the rank of Captain; then settled at Tiflis, the capital of Russian Trans-Caucasia, where he gave himself up to the study of the sciences and arts of the West, recently introduced under the auspices of the Governor-General Waransoff. His imagination appears to have been especially struck by the theatrical representations inaugurated here in a Government building about the year 1850; and, in the hope of seeing his plays performed on these boards\u2014a hope destined never to have been fulfilled\u2014he wrote in succession six dramas, and a sort of historical dialogue: these, all in Azeri-Turkish.\n\nAt Tiflis he seems to have made the acquaintance of Mirza Ja'afar, a Persian, who had come thither a pilgrim on his way to Mekka. Mirza Ja'afar, however, had in Tiflis come across certain philosophic free-thinking Persians, who so indoctrinated him with their lax views as to make him give up all idea of continuing his pilgrimage to the Holy City. He joined their mystical society, and, settling in the Caucasus, ultimately obtained some post in the Russian Administration.

Is this a fit time for declaiming poetry? We assemble to talk and take counsel, and then here comes a man who begins, \u2018I have put into verse the events of sixty years ago\u2014how the Lezg\u00ees came and how they went!\u2019 What interest has all this for us?\n\nH\u00e2j\u00ee N\u00fbrt, the Poet [ vexed ]. How \u2018What interest has it for us?\u2019 You will see what misfortunes the Lezg\u00ees at that time brought down on your ancestors\u2019 heads, and what inhumanities they perpetrated. And is the knowledge of past events of no interest to you?\n\nH\u00e2j\u00ee Kar\u00eem, the Goldsmith [ soothingly ]. Now, H\u00e2j\u00ee N\u00fbr\u00ee, this is not exactly the time for reading poetry; another day, at your leisure, you can read it to us. At present, look here and tell us whether or no you think it advisable this going to Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel and this buying of silver. Does not your good sense approve of this business?\n\nH\u00e2j\u00ee N\u00fbrt, the Poet [ sullenly ]. Not at all.\n\nMull\u00e2 Salm\u00e2n. And for what reason?\n\nH\u00e2j\u00ee N\u00fbrt, the Poet. For this reason, that each one\u2019s profession must be for him his own Elixir, and his means of livelihood: so what need is there to go running after Alchemists? I have not seen Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel, but I know by experience that he is just setting up a shop for befooling people. Even though he has been to Tiflis, as \u2019tis said, who is it that has given him permission to practise Alchemy? Who has seen his Alchemy? There can be no Elixir in this material world. But this Shaikh S\u00e2lih, who comes from Kh\u00e2chmaz, has bereft you of your wits to such a point that you believe his words, and so will not give credence to anything that I may say.\n\nH\u00e2j\u00ee Kar\u00eem, the Goldsmith. But there is proof that a great deal of Elixir exists in this material world, and so there is no need of discussing that matter. But just you prove in\nhis profession is to be his Elixir! Why nith, and I am unable to make sufficient ses!\n\nPoet. Because you have lost credit with one will confide his business to you. In er gold or silver they brought to you to ments, you stole more than half of it, and with brass or copper, and so returned it to t, your tricks were exposed to the light of dy brings his business to you.

Your n\u00e2n, the Barber, by means of his hone and ed a reasonable fortune, which you have r man had, with immense pains, taught barber. But you were not content with after the fashion of the Tiflis barbers, to s a doctor. But after killing a whole en, people have got to understand your ep away from you. At present you are doctor.

[Turning to H\u00e1ji N\u00fbr\u00ee] According to what you have been saying, H\u00e1ji N\u00fbr\u00ee, I at any rate ought to have become a K\u00e2r\u00fbn.\u00b9 Now why is it that I only possess a mat and a water-jar?\n\nH\u00e1ji N\u00fbr\u00ee, the Poet. That, too, has its reason. Just because your build would fit you so well to be a muleteer, it has, forsooth, got into your head that your father having been a Mull\u00e2, therefore you must be a Mull\u00e2 too. Your father had studied, and, having ability, had risen to be a Mull\u00e2, but you, who are not capable of writing your own name even, how can you become a teacher and preacher? Ability is not like the father's fur coat, which comes down by inheritance to the children. And therefore it is that you are not esteemed among the people. And how should you become rich? Why, if with your strength and your stature you had only taken to being a muleteer, you would barely have been content with gaining your hundred and fifty roubles a year by this time!\n\nSafar Beg, the Landowner. And why am I not rich?\n\nH\u00e1ji N\u00fbr\u00ee, the Poet. You own land, and you should get your wealth by attending to the sowing and the reaping. But you, to your loss, have given yourself up to idle talk, throwing yourself first into this matter and then into that; speaking evil of people behind their backs, and worrying the Government officials with silly petitions about evil-doers and oppressed innocents. At last, having let your pen run riot, you were for three years in the clutches of the law, and then three years more spending great sums of money to get free. So your life has been passed. And now you expect to get rich all of a sudden through this lying Alchemist! Just like Mashadi Jabb\u00e2r there, who, in his excess of cupidity, lent out his petty scrapings to people at an exorbitant interest so as to become a capitalist, all in a minute; but now he would be well content if he could only once more lay his hands on the principal.\n\n\u00b9 The K\u00e2r\u00fbn of the Kur\u00e2\u00ee is identical with the Biblical Korah, who headed the rebellion against Moses in the Wilderness. In Moslem legend he is proverbial for his wealth, as we say of Croesus.\nGoldsmith. Well, master Poet, even if us have made mistakes, and have not by his trade: still you yourself do not very agreeable income from your own get your dinner, you go without your get your breakfast, you go without your to what you have said, your talent\u2014ought to become the Great Elixir\n\nPoet. Yes; my talent in truth should be just as you say that, for the Elixir you is necessary to have base metal on which potency,\u2014even so, in the matter of my ise necessary to find men of taste and anding, in order that the grandeur of my preciated. But seeing that through my l myself in the midst of such fellow-are, without intelligence or culture, and nor appreciation, what gain could there a talent such as mine? and what can ?\n\nGoldsmith. How he does blunder about! lks! Who invited you to come and give here? And look now, where have you phy of yours from? Be off outside; for advice.\n\n[altogether]. Get up and go!

Well, your worships, we are ney must be ready by the beginning of we will set off by road to the Kh\u00e2chmaz ourselves before Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel.\n\nther]. Yes, we are all agreed.\n\nThe Curtain Falls.\nAct II.\u2014The Scene of the Second Act is laid in the Kh\u00e2chmas Hills. In a level meadow among the foot-hills, where the herbage is beautified with sweet-smelling flowers of every hue, two tents are pitched, at a distance of fifty paces each from the other. On a lower level than the tents stands a four-walled hut of wood, in the interior of which is seen a large forge. Conveniently placed, near the forge, are the bellows, and all around are lying fractured ingots of brass, in great lumps, as though the metal had been poured hastily into moulds and had been about to become silver. In front of one of the tents is a second\u2014smaller\u2014hut. Above, the meadow runs up into the mountains, which are snow-capped. On the further side is seen a valley, and a small river flows through it, on either side of which are clumps of oak and hazel trees of a hundred years growth, the leaves rustle in the blowing of the breeze, while birds of all sorts flit about from branch to branch and fill the valley with the melody of their harmonious song. On the other side to the meadow a spring gushes from a stoney basin, and with a gentle melancholy murmur flows down towards the valley, its waters sparkling here and there as they wind their way. To the eastward of the meadow spreads a boundless plain, running down to the Caspian Sea.\n\nMull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel occupies one of the tents, and in the other is Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed, his assistant. In the smaller hut is his servant, Darr\u00eesh \u2018Abb\u00e2s, seated amongst the tools and utensils. It is two hours after sunrise, and the sun\u2019s rays are gradually dispersing the mist which lies in the valley. Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel, the Alchemist, coming out of his tent, calls towards that of Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed. Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed, leaving his own tent, goes to him and stands respectfully before him. Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel is the first to speak.\n\nMull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel. Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed, according to what Shaikh S\u00e2lih wrote, ought not those people from Nakh\u00fb to arrive here, in the afternoon to-day?\n\nMull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed. Yes, master, or even earlier.\n\nMull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel. When these people come, Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed, pay them every respect. Make them take seat in the tent, and inquire after their health.

Ah well, one often finds places as pleasant as this; but so great a man as Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel one does not come across everywhere! Can we to-day have the honour of visiting his worship?\n\nMull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed. Our master has gone into retirement for three days, and is taken up with his devotions. It is impossible for him during these three days to give an interview to any one, or to talk, or to come out. But you can see him at the end of three days. And now be pleased to tell me the purpose of all the trouble you have given yourselves. Is it merely to make a visit to his worship, or have you some other matter too?\n\nOne of the Nakh\u00fb people. In the first place, our sole aim is to visit his worship! But secondly, each of us has brought a trifling donation to offer to him, and if he will accept it, perchance he will not be stinting to us of his favour!\n\nMull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed. Well I understand. No doubt you have brought copper money, and you want to buy silver. Now the truth of the matter is that our master, Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel, will not take the money from you. The silver that came from the last melting, and also all that which is now under our hands, is already disposed of to the Armenians of Ikl\u00ees, and for the double weight of silver that is to be given, a single weight of copper coin has already been received by us. And still another month must pass before the completion of the Elixir for this second melting. Under these circumstances, it is impossible for our master either to receive your money or to give you silver. Especially since the applicants for silver have become so numerous that the silver of each month's melting is sold a month in advance.\n\nOne of the Nakh\u00fb people. Our feelings of devotion to our master, Mull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel, have nothing to do with the fact of others being his humble servants too! If we could only see him, his very self, all would be quite right!\n\nMull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed. In that case you must have patience for three days, until the time of our master's retirement has\nYou shall be my honoured guests for\n\nVery well!

When the echoes have died away from rock and hill, and all has become silent again, they turn to Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed, and in the excess of their wonderment, begin to ply him with questions.\n\nOne of the Nakh\u00fb people. Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed, who is the Darv\u00eesh? and what is this cock?\n\nMull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed [laughing heartily]. Ha! ha! ha! Ha! ha! ha! Yes, yes! You have every right to ask the question, for you simple people are ignorant of the secrets of science, and unlearned in its methods. That grass there is a major ingredient in the Elixir, and it is only to be found in these hills. No one besides Mull\u00e2 Agh\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Kh\u00e2l\u00ee is capable of recognizing it. But according to the assertion of the Greek sages, it must grow while the cock is crowing. So it is the duty of Darv\u00eesh \u2018Abb\u00e2s each night to take the cock, and, after performing the ceremonies which you have just now witnessed, to tie the bird up in a new place, and then he must watch from sundown to dawn to keep off the jackals and foxes. Thus while by night the cock crows, the grass for the Elixir at the same time grows. In the book of The Wonders of Wondrous Matters it is plainly indicated that for the service of guarding the cock, only a Darv\u00eesh, and men of no other condition, may lawfully be employed.\n\nThe Nakh\u00fb people [in a state of wonderment]. Allah is great! All praise be to Him!\n\nThe Curtain Falls.\n\n\\(^1\\) This is a favourite position with Darvishes.\nScene of the Third Act is laid in the same inside the tent of Mull\u00e0 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel.

But the buyers of silver are so numerous! And every month, giving money for the following month, they buy in advance the silver of the next melting. Why, the silver of the last melting, and this too that is now under our hands, has already been bought by the Armenians of Ikli\u00fbs. And the silver that will be produced by the Elixir in the melting to be completed at the end of the month, that too the Jews of V\u00e2rt\u00e2sh\u00b9 have got by their begging and bothering, and they are gone off, near by, to bring the copper coin. I had not yet told Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed of it, for he is not very fond of the Jews. But I must show them some kindness, for their village is near here, and they do me many services.\n\nMull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed [interrupting the conversation]. Master, these\u2014\n\nMull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel. Be silent!\u2014In short, those who desire silver have reached such a number that they give me no leisure in which to find time for the preparation of the Elixir. For in order to prepare the ingredients of the Elixir these must be set, for the space of twenty days, in a pot made of luting-clay, to soak in Spirit of Sulphur, and each day a certain fixed quantity of fresh Spirit of Sulphur must be introduced. Then, after this, the ingredients must remain, for ten consecutive days in an alembic and retort, covered with Roseatic Acid, and every other day the Roseatic Acid must be changed and fresh added. After the termination of this portion of the preparation, the ingredients of the Elixir must be brought to the full term of its concoction by incident of igneous heat, in a crucible made of luting-clay. After a space of three sidereal hours, following on the admixture of certain other secret ingredients of a foreign nature, it then first presents an appearance of melting, subsequently coagulates, and finally becomes stable in the form of a\n\n\u00b9 Vartash or Vartashin, a village lying south of Nakh\u00fb.\nElixir has the name Elixir because of baser ores.

Now, allowing that your worship deducts two poods of this by reason of the impurity of the brass, still at the beginning of next month thirty poods of silver will be produced, as I deduce from my inspection of the amount of the crude brass and of the Elixir.\n\nMull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel.

See, Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed, what I have in my mind. The copper money of these worshipful people is but little in amount, and we will allow them ten poods of silver. Then there will remain twenty poods, and that can be given to the Jews, that my promise to them may not be broken. What think you of it? Have I not made an excellent partition? On the one hand, your mediation regarding the rights of our co-religionists has not been for naught, and on the other hand my promise given has not been forfeited.\n\nThe people of Nakh\u00fb [bowing and vastly contented]. May Heaven increase your prosperity! So please you, we will deposit the money here in your presence.\n\nMull\u00e2 Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Khal\u00eel [raising his eyebrows, contemptuously indifferent, and speaking slowly]. It is not necessary to deposit the money with me, and how should I find time enough and have leisure to attend to such trifles! Count it and give it over to Mull\u00e2 Ham\u00eed, and then in thirty days come back here and get your ten poods of virgin silver. God be with you!

Why, it is the especial property of the Elixir that for a whole farsakh\\(^1\\) round the tent where it is liquidescing, no stranger man must set foot, or else the Elixir loses its peculiar power and becomes a mere gas. On this subject the Magician of the Sprites, Sakk\u00e1k\u00ed,\\(^2\\) has most carefully insisted.

At any rate, the fact that the sacred books of the Southern Buddhists are being made accessible through Professor Oldenberg's edition of the Vinaya-pitaka,\u2014through the works of Professor Rhys Davids and other scholars,\u2014and more especially through the valuable publications of the P\u0101li Text Society, is likely, I hope, to cause a considerable accession to the ranks of P\u0101li scholars.\n\nRightly or wrongly, and in my opinion wrongly, Buddhism has always excited more attention and interest in this country than Br\u0101hmanism, and the relationship of the one to the other is not yet generally understood.\n\nI may therefore perhaps be held excused if I venture to come before this Society to-day, not with any new theory or discovery, either in the science of language or religion, but with a contribution towards setting forth more clearly the debt that Buddhism owes to Br\u0101hmanism, and Br\u0101hmanism to Buddhism, and the inter-relationship between two systems which together influence the creed, conduct and social condition of more than one-third of the population of the world.\n\nI need scarcely say that I am here using the term Buddhism in a restricted sense.

If this be Pantheism, as commonly alleged, it is a kind of spiritual Pantheism very different from the ordinary Pantheism of European philosophy.\n\nHind\u016bism, on the other hand, is a system built up on the doctrine of devotion to the personal gods \u015aiva and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. It postulates the eternal existence of those personal gods as its starting-point, and ends in simple polytheism and idolatry.\n\nIf we compare in the same way philosophical with popular Buddhism, the difference seems to lie in this:\n\nPhilosophical Buddhism\u2014or at least the truest form of it\u2014is a system built up on the doctrine of the utter unreality and undesirableness of life in any form or state, and the non-existence of any spiritual essence, as distinct from material organisms. It postulates the eternal existence of\nrting-point, and ends in simple Nihilism. written on the whole visible universe, even the most perfect human being must hence.\n\nsm, on the other hand, is a system built of certain perfected human beings con- l gods.

He himself was a Hind\u016b of the Hind\u016bs, and he remained a Hind\u016b to the end.\n\nAnd it is remarkable that just as the Founder of Christianity, being Himself a Jew, never required his followers to give up their Jewish creed or usages, so the founder of Buddhism, being himself a Hind\u016b, never required his adherents to make any formal renunciation of their ancestral religion, as if they had been converted to an entirely new faith.\n\nNor had the Buddha any idea of ostentatiously courting popularity as a champion of universal social equality and denouncer of all distinctions of rank\u2014a kind of Tribune of the people, whose mission was to protect them from the tyranny of caste.\n\nWhat he rather aimed at was to form a caste of his own, that is to say, an order of monks which had in its constitution much of the character of a caste, though not a priestly one\u2014a vast association of persons who were all to be equals in rank\u2014a brotherhood in which all were equally under the triple vow of celibacy, poverty and mendicancy\u2014a society in which all were equally dominated by one idea\u2014an idea very prevalent before Gautama\u2019s time\u2014that life was not worth living under any circumstances, whether on earth or in heaven, whether in present or future bodies.\n\nThe founding of such a monastic Order was, without doubt, the Buddha\u2019s principal aim; and when founded, it contained within itself potentialities for expansion of which its founder probably never dreamed.\n\nIts growth soon surpassed all anticipations, and its ramifications rapidly extended in all directions, spreading in the end to distant countries, where, like the Indian Fig-tree, they sent down roots to form vigorous plants even after the decay of the parent stem.\n\nIn point of fact, an organized monastic system, which opened its arms to all comers of whatever rank, and enforced on its members the duty of extending its boundaries by itinerancy,\n\n1 This, I admit, is not consistent with what I said in Indian Wisdom (p. 55), but when I wrote that work the Tripitaka was not so well known as it is now.\nrolling onward of the wheel of the Bud-\nuted from the earliest times the chief\nbackbone, of Buddhism, without which it\nbeen propagated, nor even have held its\nf its origin for so many centuries.\nis main design, Gautama was really no\nducer of new ideas foreign either to the\nf Br\u0101hmanism.\nl always been an adjunct, or accompani-\nmanical system.

His aim was to form a vast\nwell-organized fraternity of celibate monks, co-extensive with humanity itself; and although these were to be collected in local centres, they were nevertheless bound to move about from one place to another both to obtain their daily food and for the propagation of the Buddha's doctrine. It should always, indeed, be borne in mind that celibacy, poverty, and mendicancy were three essentials of true Buddhism, and not a mere accidental accompaniment of it.\n\nIt is to be noted, however, that Gautama did not think it necessary to distinguish the members of his Order by any new title, but preferred making use of some of the current Br\u0101hmanical names.\n\nHis usual mode of designating them was by the term Bhikshu (P\u0101li Bhikkhu) 'beggars,' to indicate their poverty; though they were also called \u015ar\u0101vaka 'hearers,' to denote their attitude of attention as hearers of the Law; and \u015arama\u1e47a (P\u0101li Sama\u1e47a, Sanskrit root \u015aram), to indicate the labour and fatigue they had to undergo after their admission to the Order.\n\nFor although Buddhism has the credit of being the easiest and least burdensome religious system in the world, and its monks among the idlest of men\u2014as having properly no rites and ceremonies to perform, and nothing to do in the way of working for a livelihood\u2014yet in real truth the carrying out the objects contemplated by the Founder was no sinecure if earnestly undertaken.\n\nIt was not possible for men to be really idle who felt that their only mode of avoiding starvation was by begging their daily bread from place to place, and that as members of the Order they were bound to be constantly engaged in turning the wheel of the law, in bringing all their bodily desires into subjection, and in practising profound meditation for the attainment of true knowledge.\n\nThis last duty\u2014the duty of meditation\u2014the Buddha himself\u2014as is well known\u2014had set the example of performing for many years as a means of attaining true enlightenment. And it may be here pointed out that in doing so, he had merely conformed to the practice of Yoga, which, though\na regular system of philosophy, was at enough among the Br\u0101hmans.\n\nlittle doubt that Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101, Dhy\u0101na, and ms of abstract contemplation and mental frequently resorted to by Br\u0101hmans in th much the same object he had in view\u2014nsight and true enlightenment of mind. proved by a reference to Manu vi. 72.\n\nor ancient Vedic prayer\u2014still used by ian fellow-subjects at their daily devotions n act of meditation performed with the \u2014\u201cLet us meditate on the excellent glory fying Sun, may he enlighten our under-\n\nof the A\u015bvattha or sacred P\u012bpal tree as the first stirrings of the divine afflatus\u2014nysterious rustling of its tremulous leaves like themselves felt, was quite in harmony ideas; for we know that in the Ka\u1e6dha the root of this tree is identified with the hman, and that a passage in the Mundaka .), and a Mantra of the Rig-veda (I. 164, e conception.

He was well aware that if every man and woman had been led through his example and teaching to remain unmarried, and go about from one place to another, either as a mendicant or preacher, there would have been no work done, no food produced, no children born, and in time no humanity\u2014nay no Buddhism\u2014left.\n\nHe had to take the Indian world as he found it, and the generality of people were in Gautama's day very much what they are in India now-a-days\u2014bent on early marriage and resolute in devoting themselves to the task of earning a livelihood by honest work\u2014aye and down right hard work too.\n\nWithout doubt celibacy in instances of extraordinary sanctity has always commanded respect in India; but in no country of the world has married life been so universally honoured, and the duty of toiling daily for self-support so universally admitted. It is not very likely, then, that the following sentiment from the Sutta-Nip\u0101ta could have met with very general approval among the Buddha's hearers:\n\n\"A wise man should avoid married life as if it were a burning pit of live coals\" (Dhammika-Sutta 21, Kum\u0101ra Sv\u0101m\u012b).\n\nAnd indeed it seems to me that the very circumstance that the foundations of Buddhism were not laid, as those of Br\u0101hmanism were\u2014and as those of Christianity notably are\u2014on the sacred rock of family-life, and that Gautama made abstinence from marriage essential to actual enrolment in his society, and to perseverance on the way of salvation, is sufficient of itself to account for the fact that Buddhism never gained any real stability or permanence in India.\n\nAt any rate it is clear that the Buddha, foreseeing the impossibility of converting the mass of the people to his anti-matrimonial views, very soon gathered round him an exterior circle of married laymen. These lay brethren were bound to Buddhism by very slender ties. They were required to conform to the simplest possible code of morality.\n\nProbably the only test a layman had to undergo was his willingness to appear before an assembly of monks and repeat\nke refuge with the Buddha, his Law and indeed it seems to me probable that it was t lay adherents were not called disciples, as, that is, 'Servers,' or 'Honourers,' and en Up\u0101sik\u0101s.\n\ney had to perform serving, and this chiefly ering of food and gifts to the monks.

Nor were they, as I have already be believers in the Buddha's doctrine, of their general creed.\n\ns, that when a man presented himself nonks and claimed to be admitted as a ground of his readiness to do homage to law and his Order, he was not thereby aining a half or even whole belief in the ds and customs of his family.

It certainly had a prophylactic effect in warding off violent opposition, and helped to secure the permanence of Buddhism for many centuries in India. On the other hand, it had its *per contra* disadvantages, and the absence of any sharp lines of separation between Buddhism and co-existing creeds and superstitions makes it easy to understand how in the end it happened that on the destruction of Buddhist monasteries in India by hostile religionists, Buddhism seemed to melt away or become merged in Hind\u016bism, while all its temples, symbols, idols, and sacred places became subservient to Vaishnavism and \u015aaivism.\n\nYet, as a matter of fact, Br\u0101hmanism and Buddhism co-existed for about a thousand years after A\u015boka\u2019s Council (about 245 B.C.). If conflicts took place, they were not general, but confined to particular localities, and I think it may be safely affirmed that if Buddhism was ever anywhere persecuted, it never anywhere persecuted in return. I myself was much struck in one of my visits to India by the evidence Ellora (in the Niz\u0101m\u2019s territory) affords of friendly tolerance between Br\u0101hmans, Buddhists, and Jains. Br\u0101hmanical, Buddhist, and Jain caves may be there seen side by side, and their inmates no doubt lived on terms of just as much harmony as the members of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Wesleyan communions do in Europe at the present day. It was only in the South of India that any violent crusade against Buddhism\u2014like that instituted by Kum\u0101rila and \u015aa\u1e45kara in the seventh and eighth centuries of our era\u2014seems to have been carried on. In other parts of India, Br\u0101hmanism crept up somewhat insidiously to its rival, and drew the heat out of its body by close contact. In brief, I hold that if it be true to say that Br\u0101hmanism was the birth-place of Buddhism, it is quite as true to assert that in India at least Br\u0101hmanism became its grave, and that the passing away of the Buddhistic system was, on the whole, peaceful and unattended with any violent pangs.\\(^1\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) No doubt there are places in the South of India where there is evidence\nthe Order of Nuns (Bhikshu\u1e47\u012b, in P\u0101li generally believed that at the outset of his refrained from imparting, or allowing others s to women, simply because he feared the ging communication with the female sex. that women were indebted to the inter-\u2019s favourite cousin \u0100nanda for permission d of their own.\n\nno long period elapsed before the Buddha the privilege of entering on the same as that opened to men.\n\nthat at the time when Gautama lived, kept in actual seclusion. Yet we learn ook that they enjoyed little independence regarded as inferior beings, incapable of religion as men.\n\nrising, therefore, that Gautama, while ice of the plea for women\u2019s rights under sal brotherhood and equality, and while a sisterhood of nuns, should have placed ction of monks, and made them subject to ll matters of discipline.\n\nsaid about the theory of social equality women in Buddhist countries, there can be India Buddhism effected little alteration as about women.\n\nclear that men were regarded as possess- ver women in respect of the more rapid ina, and that every nun cherished as an e ambition the hope of being born as a e birth.\n\nI may instance among the places I visited the Jadura. When I concluded the reading of this paper ty on February 15, 1886, our President, Colonel Yule, the members of two religious communions who hold on that account hate and oppose each other all the intense tolerance and eclecticism that characterized dhism must have prevented mutual persecution, except Brahmanism was much more likely to have adopted tem than to have persecuted and expelled it. In point well known, turned the Buddha into one of Vishnu\u2019s they are ready to turn the Founder of Christianity also.\nSuch then was the monachism which lay at the root of true Buddhism. It was in no one particular openly antagonistic to Hind\u016b caste. It was supported, as we have seen, by a large body of lay associates, and those lay brethren who refrained from enrolling themselves as members of the Order retained their caste-distinctions without any denunciations from Gautama. Nor did Gautama ever rail at the Br\u0101hmans, or dispute their right to be regarded as men of higher social rank. On the contrary, he treated them with respect, and taught others to do so, just as he admitted the superiority of the gods over men, and allowed men to worship them; merely denying that either gods or Br\u0101hmans could alter a man\u2019s condition in a future life.\n\nWhat he really opposed was priestcraft and priestly domination, not caste; for, be it observed, Buddhism recognizes no priests, and has properly no priests of its own, unless monks can be so called.\n\nOther reformers and leaders of Hind\u016b sects had done much the same before him, so that even in this respect it cannot be said that Gautama struck out any wholly original line.\n\nBut it was not merely in the establishment and organization of a universal monastic Order, by means of which he might propagate what he believed to be true knowledge, that the Buddha took care to avoid any direct or offensive opposition to the spirit of Br\u0101hmanism: he was equally careful in regard to the form in which the knowledge so propagated was presented. It seems indeed as if the great Teacher to whom the majority of Asiatic races have for centuries looked as a kind of god-like example, if not as an actual god, was naturally so tolerant of the opinions of others, and so humble-minded in regard to his own, that he could not bring himself to pose in the attitude of an original thinker.\n\n1 He even asserted that birth in a Br\u0101hman family would be a reward for merit. According to Burnouf \u201cvery little difference appears between the Buddhists and Br\u0101hmans in the early Buddhist writings, and Buddha is often described as followed by a crowd of Br\u0101hmans as well as of Bhikkhus.\u201d See Journal R.A.S. o.b. Vol. XII. p. 242.\ndoctrines of Buddhism will be found on more or less amplifications or modifications of current Br\u0101hmaical ideas, which again modified by an interchange with Buddhistic doctrine, it may be doubted whether Gautama's whole life-time ever expressed opinions on any serious offence to the most orthodox would not of course wholly dispense with those of his own; but all his dogmas were more of a compromise with old-established\n\na that the Buddha's method of clothing new dress, or, to adopt another metaphor, the with old, had in it a fascination very men. For Br\u0101hmanism was in truth other creeds, and equally eclectic. Even of its most orthodox adherents, he was one of three ways or methods of securing\n\ne way of sacrifices, ceremonies and rites, Mantra and Br\u0101hma\u1e47a portion of the\n\nthe way of devotion to one or other of worshipped personal deities, leading in ism and Vaishnavism (as ultimately un-\n\nthe way of knowledge as set forth in the\n\nthree ways, or all three together, might fear of being charged with heresy, so long as the Veda was not impugned; but the knowledge, which was incomparably the not open to all.\n\nreserved for the more intellectual and\n\nusually expressed in Sanskrit by Karm\u0101\u1e47a, Bhakti, and the doctrine of Bhakti was not fully developed till after the Upanishads prove that the practice of devotion must have existed.\nphilosophically-minded Br\u0101hmans. The generality of men had to content themselves with the first and second ways. All that the Buddha then did was, in the first place, to institute an Order to which all classes were admissible; and in the second place to throw open the third or highest way\u2014the way of true knowledge\u2014to all who wished to enter upon it, of whatever rank or caste or mental calibre they might be. No human being, he declared, not even the lowest, was to be shut out from free access to the path of true enlightenment.\n\nAnd here, of course, it will occur to most persons to inquire what was the nature of that knowledge which the Buddha thus made accessible to all?\n\nWas it some deep spiritual truth? Some abstruse doctrine of philosophy, or physical, or metaphysical science? Was the Buddha's open way very different from the old, well-fenced-off and carefully-guarded Br\u0101hmanical way? Was his knowledge opposed to Br\u0101hmanical knowledge?\n\nUnhappily we are here met by a difficulty. The Buddha promulgated a creed, but he never, like Muhammad, wrote a book or even a single line. He was, in some respects, the Socrates of India, and we are obliged to trust to his followers for a record of his sayings and doings. Still we have no reason to doubt the genuineness of what has been handed down in regard to the main doctrines he taught, and we are at once struck with the fact that Gautama called his own knowledge Bodhi and not Veda. Most probably he did so because he wished to imply that his own knowledge, as attainable by all through their own efforts and intuitions, was to be distinguished from Veda or knowledge obtainable through the Br\u0101hmans alone, and by them through supernatural revelation only.\n\nBut it should be noted\u2014as pointed out long ago by Professor A. Weber of Berlin, and recently by Professor Oldenberg\u2014that even in the choice of a name derived from the Sanskrit root Budh 'to know,' the self-enlightened Buddha was only following the authors of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as. For example, the \u015auta-patha-br\u0101hma\u1e47a called a\nwho had attained to perfect knowledge may be pointed out, too, that in Manu man is called Budha.\n\ndoctrines which grew out of his self-ge Gautama still called Dharma 'law,' me term employed by the Br\u0101hmans\u2014of law in its most comprehensive sense, er it the physical laws of the Universe, political and social duties.

Witness the following Maitr\u0101ya\u1e47i or Maitri Upanishad :\u2014\n\nbody, ever liable ambition, avarice, illusion,\nf, envy, hatred, separation\nwe hold most dear, association\nwe hate; continually exposed\nthirst, disease, decrepitude,\ngrowth, decline and death,\ncan there be for true enjoyment?\"\n\nta-patha-br\u0101hma\u1e47a xiv. 7, 2, 17.\nAlso the following, from Manu (vi. 77):\n\n\"This body like a house composed of the (five) elements, with bones for its rafters, tendons for its connecting links, flesh and blood for its mortar, skin for its covering; this house filled with impurities, infested by sorrow and old age, the seat of disease, full of pain and passion, and not lasting\u2014a man ought certainly to abandon.\"\n\nLater writers chime in, thus (Vair\u016bgya-s\u0101taka of Bhar\u1e6d\u1e5bhari, iii. 32):\n\n\"Enjoyments are alloyed by fear of sickness,\nHigh rank may have a fall, abundant wealth\nIs subject to exactions, dignity\nEncounters risk of insult, strength is ever\nIn danger of enfeeblement by foes,\nA handsome form is jeopardized by women,\nScripture is open to assaults of critics,\nMerit incurs the spite of wicked men,\nThe body lives in constant dread of death,\nOne course alone is proof against alarm,\nRenounce the world, and safety may be won.\"\n\nAnd again (iii. 50):\n\n\"One hundred years\\(^1\\) is the appointed span\nOf human life, one half of this goes by\nIn sleep and night; one half the other half\nIn childhood and old age; the rest is passed\nIn sickness, separation, pain and service\u2014\nHow can a human being find delight\nIn such a life, vain as a watery bubble?\"\n\nThen we know that the removal of the pain caused by desire, ignorance, and bodily existence, was the chief aim of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47ical systems of philosophy, quite as much as of the Buddhistic.\n\nThe very first aphorism of the S\u0101\u1e45khya system defines the chief aim of man to be complete deliverance from the misery and pain incident to corporeal existence. The Ny\u0101ya,\n\n\\(^1\\) Centenarians (Sat\u0101vus, Sat\u0101-varsha) seem to have been rather common in India in ancient times, if we may judge by the allusions to them in Manu and other works.

Nay more\u2014it is virtually to deny the existence of a supreme universal Spirit also.\n\nFor how can a merely abstract universal Spirit, which is unconscious of personality, be regarded as possessing any real existence worth being called true life?\n\nTo assert that such a Spirit is pure abstract Entity or (according to Ved\u0101nta phraseology) pure Existence (without anything to exist for), pure Thought or even Consciousness (without anything to think about, or be conscious about), pure Joy (without anything to rejoice about), is practically to reduce it to pure non-entity.\n\nAll that Gautama did, therefore, was to bring common sense to bear in purging Br\u0101hmanism of a dogma which appeared to him to be a mere figment and a sham.\n\nHe simply eliminated as meaningless and incapable of proof the doctrine of an impersonal incorporeal unconscious spirit, whether human or divine.\n\nAnd this leads us to the important question how far the great central Br\u0101hmanical doctrine of soul-transmigration formed the basis of the Buddha's theory on the same subject. It might seem at first that the teaching of the Buddha would differ materially from that of the Br\u0101hmans in regard to this central dogma. The real fact was that the divergence of the Buddhist doctrine from the Br\u0101hmanical theory of metempsychosis was not greater than was to be expected from the difference between the two systems in regard to the doctrine of soul and spirit. Of course Gautama was brought up to accept unreservedly the Br\u0101hmanical theory as minutely described in Manu's Law-book (chapter\nelsewhere). The great Br\u0101hmanical law-\nth a triple order of transmigration through\nhigher planes of existence, resulting from\nbad acts, words and thoughts.

The process of the new creation is so instantaneous that it is equivalent to the continuance of the same personality, pervaded by the same consciousness, though it is only really connected with the previous personality by the force of acts done and character formed in that personality. In short (as Prof. Rhys Davids has well shown), to speak of transmigration of souls as a doctrine of Buddhism is misleading.\n\nA true Buddhist does not believe in the passing of a soul from one body to another, but in the passing on of what may be called act-force or character-force: that is to say, in the constant perpetuation and transmission of the aggregate of merit and demerit resulting from a man's acts so as to cause a continuous and connected series or succession of separate forms and personalities. It is this act-force alone, commonly called Karma, which is the connecting link between each man's past, present, and future bodies.\n\nIn its subtle and irresistible operation this accumulated Act-force may be compared to stored-up chemical or electric energy. It is a force which continually creates and re-creates the whole man, and perpetuates his personal identity (even in the absence of recollection) through separate forms, whether it compels him to ascend or descend in the scale of being. Be it observed, however, that the scale of descent appears to be limited in true Buddhism to animal organisms. It is not extended, as in the Br\u0101hmanical system, to plants and minerals, stocks and stones.\n\nEnough then has been stated to make it clear that the only creator recognized by Buddhists is, so to speak, Act-force. It is Act-force that creates worlds. It is Act-force that creates all beings in any of the six classes into which Buddhists divide all beings,\u2014namely, gods, men, demons, animals, ghosts and the dwellers in hell. We know that it is an axiom with modern European men of science that no\nlost, but must of necessity be transmitted in some form or other. Now the Buddhist doctrine held this very thing many centuries ago in its essence generated by a man's character and actions. The ancient philosophical philosophy affirmed much the same. Even the modern Positivist philosopher asserts that both body and mind are resolved into nothingness at death. The only immortal part of us is what we have done, what good words or actions we have left behind us, to be made use of by our successors and improved on for the elevation of humanity. It is these, according to the Buddhist doctrine, that are strong enough to re-create us.\n\nIt is said that the force of Gautama's own acts had been transmitted through a long chain of successive incarnations in the perfect Buddha. And it is characteristic of the perfect Buddha that he possesses the faculty of recollecting these personalities in his mind. The stories of at least five hundred of these (J\u0101takas) are even now daily repeated to the eager listeners in every Buddhist country and part of Asia, and are believed to convey moral lessons, much in the same manner, if I may say so with all reverence, that the stories of the patriarchs, prophets, and heroes, who are supposed to be types of Christ, are repeated as part of religious services.\n\nThe relationship between Br\u0101hmanism and Buddhism was an interchange of ideas which took place again exemplified by the Buddhist birth-episodes which are obviously mere modifications or developments and folk-lore long current in India, and evidently been imported from Buddhism into the Sanskrit literature.\n\nOne is constantly reminded of similar stories in the \u0100ra\u1e47ya-tantra, Hitopade\u015ba, R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, and others. A noteworthy point about the repeated stories is that there appears to have been no\nDarwinian rise from lower to higher forms; no working of the way gradually and progressively upwards; but, on the contrary, a mere jumble of metamorphoses. Thus we find him born twenty times as the god Indra, eighty-three times as an ascetic, fifty-eight times as a king, twenty-four times as a Br\u0101hman, once as a gamester, eighteen times as a monkey, six times as an elephant, eleven times as a deer, once as a dog, four times as a serpent, six times as a snipe, once as a frog, twice as a fish, forty-three times as a tree-god, twice as a pig, ten times as a lion, four times as a cock, twice as a thief, once as a devil-dancer, and so on in an endless irregular series, without any apparent conformity to any rule or law of development.\n\nAnother wise man of the East, who lived long before Gautama, spoke of \"the path of the just shining more and more unto the perfect day.\" Of this kind of progressive advance towards higher planes of perfection, the Indian sage knew nothing. Nor to the Buddha, of course, would such a doctrine as that of \"imputed Righteousness\" have conveyed any meaning whatever. With Gautama, righteousness and unrighteousness, holiness and sin, were merely forces causing in the one case a man's rebirth either in one of the heavens or in higher earthly corporeal forms, and in the other his rebirth in one of the hells or in lower corporeal forms. \"Not in the heavens,\" says the Dhamma-pada, \"not in the midst of the sea, not if thou hidest thyself away in the clefts of the mountains, wilt thou find a place where thou canst escape the force resulting from thy evil actions.\" And this Buddhist theory of every man's destiny being dependent on his own acts is quite in keeping with Br\u0101hmanical ideas expressed here and there in Sanskrit literature. Take for example the following: \u2014 P\u016brva-janma-kritam karma tad daivam iti kathyate, \"the act committed in a former birth that is called one's destiny\"; and again, \"As from a lump of clay a workman makes what he pleases, even so a man obtains\n\n1 Proverbs iv. 18.\n2 Dhammapada, 127, 219 (Dr. Oldenberg's Buddha, p. 243), with a slight variation of phraseology.\nhe has wrought out for himself\u201d (Hiton).\n\nI too of a sentiment by a poet of our own\u2014still travel with us from afar, we have been makes us what we are.\u201d\u00b9\n\nte\u2019s saying, \u201cEvery man is the son of his of Wordsworth\u2019s, often quoted, \u201cThe child a;\u201d and of Longfellow\u2019s, \u201cLives of great we can make ourselves sublime.\u201d\n\nties and rites performed by priests avail r devotion to personal gods avail aught, whatever, except a man\u2019s own works and the slightest efficacy.\n\nods and demons of the Hind\u016b Pantheon addhists to be mere myths. They existed oreal forms than those of men, and were, beings, capable of working good or evil, among them the Vedic god Indra being\n\nnot omnipotent, and were wholly powerless y one on the road to his own salvation.\n\n> that division of the Buddhist system ain the operation of physical laws in the tion of worlds, we are again reminded of\n\nnoted that, notwithstanding the great Buddhism and Br\u0101hmanism in regard to it, the disagreement in the end appears than real. The same may be said with ideas on the subject of matter as opposed ain, the gulf between the two systems be impassable. It might indeed have since Gautama denied the eternal exis would at least give eternal existence to\n\n\u00b9 the text of the 70th chapter of George Eliot\u2019s\nBut no; here, again, Buddhism allowed no permanence. Here, again, the only eternal thing is the Causality of Act-force.\n\nThe world around us, with all its visible phenomena, must be recognized as an existing entity, for we see before our eyes evidence of its actual existence. But it is an entity produced out of nonentity, and destined to lapse again into nonentity when its time is fulfilled.\n\nFor out of nothingness it came, and into nothingness must it return, to re-appear again, it is true, but as a wholly new creation brought into being by the accumulated force of its own acts, not evolved out of any eternally existing germ.\n\nIt is thus that the Universe is like an endless succession of countless bubbles which are for ever forming, expanding, drifting onwards, bursting and re-forming, each bubble owing its re-formation to the force generated by its vanished predecessor;\n\n\"Worlds on worlds are rolling ever\nFrom creation to decay:\nLike the bubbles on a river,\nSparkling, bursting, borne away.\"\u00b9\n\nOr like an interminable succession of wheels for ever coming into view, for ever rolling onwards, disappearing and reappearing; for ever passing from being to non-being, and again from non-being to being.\n\nAs to the question what force created the first world, the Buddha hazarded no opinion. He held this to be an inexplicable mystery.\n\nMany of these speculations also may be traced back to a Br\u0101hmaical source. We know that a fundamental doctrine of Br\u0101hmanism is *Ex nihilo nihil fit*. The true Ved\u0101nta philosophy makes the Universe proceed out of an eternal illusion, and students of Manu are familiar with the doctrine of Kalpas, or immense intervals of time (lasting for 4,320,000,000 earthly years), during which every creation attains perfection, and then again deteriorates and decays till it is utterly dissolved, not indeed into nothingness,\n\n\u00b9 Shelley's Hellas.\nor simple unconscious Spirit, to be again inauguration of a fresh Kalpa.\n\nied, however, that pure unconscious spirit different from pure nothingness?\n\nauthor of a well-known hymn of the Rig-\n\ng there was neither naught nor aught,\nneither sky nor atmosphere above.\ndarkness hid in darkness, gloom in gloom;\nater, all a chaos indiscreet,\nne lay void, shrouded in nothingness.\"\n\nKalpas or ages of the world, we know that notion of vast intervals of time exceeds the modern geologists; yet the Buddhist con-\n\nzaggeration of the same notion.\n\ned, say Buddhist writers, that a solid rock 16 miles high, and the same in length and only rubbed once in a hundred years with cloth, and by this slight friction reduced o the size of a mango-seed; that would sea of the immense duration of a Buddhist\n\nBuddhist theory of numerous heavens and an equally exaggerated expansion of the\n\nt doctrines of Br\u0101hmanism was that earth, even formed three worlds (Manu xi. 236), st writers expanding these into three sets s, the first comprising the seven worlds (K\u0101ma), viz. the earth and six heavens inhabitants of which are capable of those desires which lead to re-birth and death,\n\nresided over by M\u0101ra, the deadly spirit is the atmosphere, and who, as Prof. shown, is the counterpart of Mrityu, the Kathopanishad. The second group 'form' (R\u016bpa), divided according to four\nplaces of pure thought or meditation, and said to contain sixteen (or according to the Northern school seventeen or even eighteen) heavens. The third group are called 'formless worlds,' and contain four heavens, inhabited by beings who appear to exist in a highly sublimated transcendental state, untroubled by desires, feelings, or thoughts.\n\nSimilar hyperbole is used in describing the numerous Buddhist hells. Manu (iv. 88\u201390) reckons 21 hells or places of torment of various degrees, but these are expanded by Buddhists into 136, the eight principal of which are minutely described as terrible places of torture. The worst, called Av\u012bci, is for unbelievers in and revilers of Buddha and his law.\n\nAnd now, before I conclude, I feel rather like a foolhardy person rushing recklessly over thorny ground when I venture to speak of the culminating Buddhist doctrine of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a? I think, however, I may assert two things about this much controverted expression without fear of being contradicted.\n\nThe first is that the word Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is an expression common both to Br\u0101hma\u1e47ism and Buddhism. It was probably current in Gautama's time, and certainly occurs in the Mah\u0101-bh\u0101rata, parts of which may extend back to the time when Buddhism first arose in India. Of course, like some of the crucial theological terms of Christianity, it is capable of being interpreted differently, according to the views of the interpreter and the point he wishes to establish.\n\nThe second is that it would be about as unreasonable to restrict the expression Nirv\u0101\u1e47a to one meaning as it would be to restrict both Br\u0101hma\u1e47ism and Buddhism\u2014two most elastic, comprehensive and Protean systems\u2014which have constantly changed their front to suit changing circumstances and varying national peculiarities at different epochs and in different countries, to one hard and fast outline.\n\nNirv\u0101\u1e47a, no doubt, properly means 'a state of extinction' like that of a blown-out flame, but such extinction may have at least three meanings. It may indicate first a complete extinction of the fires\\(^1\\) of the passions and a total cessation\n\n\\(^1\\) The three chief fires are lust, infatuation and hatred.\ncially the desire for individual existence\u2014\nall Arhats while still living in the world,\nBuddha himself, at the moment when he\nood, forty-four years before his complete\nsecondly, there is a form of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a in-\nin which the leading idea seems to be\nrelease from all pain, accompanied by a\npeace and rest, all fear of further bodily\nterminated. This condition, implying as\nconsciousness of blissful repose, precludes\nnnihilation. Then, thirdly, Nirv\u0101\u1e47a may\nf entire cessation of re-births, with utter\nconscious personal existence as attained by\ning to the orthodox view, at the moment\n\nd to the first form of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a\u2014the\nres of the passions\u2014it must be borne in\nng of profound respect for such a con-\nd in the mind of every true Hind\u016b, and\ny nothing new in this idea.\nno one can have come in contact with the\ntheir own country, without observing that\nocratic Br\u0101hma\u1e47 to allow others to see\nany passion, to exhibit any emotion or\nded as a proof of weakness.\nunderstand, therefore, that when the\nhis followers to strive after a wholly\n, he addressed a sympathetic audience.\nexhortations were heard in India, his\nheld persons in the highest respect who\ntirely suppressed their passions. The\nGautama\u2019s teaching was that he made\nnt on all true Buddhists alike, without\n\u2019s state of absolute impassiveness is well\ne by the usual attitude of the images\nia\u2019s death, were carved to represent him\nis that the Buddha did not advocate the suppression of\n\u2014an attitude of complete tranquillity, passionless composure, and dignified calm.\n\nThen, with regard to the second phase of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a, in which the main idea is cessation of all pain, this seems to correspond very much to the Br\u0101hma\u1e47ical \u0100pavarga, described in the Ny\u0101ya, and defined by a commentator, Vatsay\u0101yana, to be Sarva-du\u1e25kha-cheda. I trust I shall not shock my Indian friends if I illustrate this condition by an example from the animal creation. In crossing the Indian Ocean, when unruffled by the slightest breeze, I have sometimes observed a jelly-fish floating on the surface of the transparent water, apparently lifeless, but really drinking in the warm fluid in a state of lazy blissful repose.\n\nNo Buddhist at least could look at such a sight without being reminded of the second idea of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a\u2014the idea of, so to speak, floating in perfect peace and cessation from all pain on a kind of ocean of conscious beatitude.\n\nWith regard to the highest form of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a\u2014sometimes called Parinirv\u0101\u1e47a\u2014absolute extinction of conscious personal existence and individuality, I have already shown that if this is to be distinguished from the Br\u0101hma\u1e47ical idea of absorption into an impersonal unconscious spirit\u2014whereby the Ego of personal identity was utterly destroyed\u2014it is a distinction without much difference.\n\nWe may be quite sure that although the highest form of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is the ultimate goal, and great object of all the loftiest aspirations of a true Buddhist, it has no place in the aims, efforts, and even in the thoughts of the ordinary adherents of Buddhism.\n\nThe apex of all the desires, the culminating point of all the ambition of the most religiously-minded Buddhists of the present day, point to a life in one of the heavens, while the great mass of the people aim only at escaping one of the hells, and elevating themselves to a higher condition of bodily existence in their next birth on this earth, and perhaps on that very part of this earth which is the scene of their present toils, joys and sorrows.\n\nAnd now, in conclusion, let me say a few words in regard\nCode of Morality. It may be well asked, \"Can the scheme of morality find a place in a system where all thought and action proceed from ignorance and error? Can virtuous conduct be the product of a mistake as much as the life in higher states of being?\" This question seems difficult of explanation, but it is evident that notwithstanding the constant suffering and misery resulting from every form of vice, it is taught that the life of a virtuous man would be better than a wicked life and a life of vice.\n\nThe accumulation of merit (ku\u015bala or punya or dharma) was considered essential; the practice of morality, self-renunciation, and almsgiving, according to the example set by the Buddha, was made an absolutely indispensable condition for a man's re-birth in higher corporeal forms, for the attainment of perfect knowledge, perfect deliverance, and perfect deliverance from individual existence during the period.\n\nIn comparing Buddhism and Br\u0101hmanism might be well worth while a few words as schemes for the intense cultivation of self-righteousness, with a view to getting rid of the self. It should be clearly understood that the self spoken of here is not the self spoken of in Christianity, but the individuality and continued personal consciousness.\n\nIn both systems Buddhism is certainly entitled to be regarded as the perfect art of merit-making. For every merchant who keeps a ledger, with a regular account, and a daily entry of profit and loss, so store up a money-balance in a worldly sense, so as to be constantly accumulating a merit-balance of Karma.\n\nIn a Christian sense, a man must be Godly righteous; in a Buddhistic sense, a man must be righteous. But the righteousness of the Buddhist is not merely the holiness, nor even the perfection of\nself-enlightenment by the dissipation of ignorance. It is the perfection of merit-making, whereby the complete extinction of individual existence is achieved.\n\nI do not, of course, mean to imply that the Buddhist system of morality is not of a very high order.\n\nOften, indeed, it rises to the highest plane of Christian teaching, but the same can be said of the moral code existing among Br\u0101hmans and Hind\u016bs before the Buddha's time, and in nothing is the close connection between Buddhism and Br\u0101hmanism better shown than in the moral precepts of these two systems which are sometimes nearly identical.\n\nThere is scarcely a sentiment in the Dhammapada and Sutta-nip\u0101ta which may not be matched by something similar in either Manu, the Epic poems, or the Niti-\u015b\u0101stras of Sanskrit literature.\n\nMost certainly the highest morality of both Buddhists and Br\u0101hmans has this in common, that both had an ultimate reference to their own interests, and that both inculcated doing good to others, with a view to laying up such a store of merit for themselves as might secure their own advancement in future states of corporeal existence.\nend of Jim\u00fbtav\u00e2hana is related twice in \u00e2gara, in the 22nd Tar\u00e2nga, from which translation is made, as well as in the 90th versions of the legend differ somewhat of the story, the latter version giving Jim\u00fbtav\u00e2hana's courtship and home-life, omitting all account of his actions in a their results. The legend has also been N\u00e2g\u00e2nanda, or Joy of the Snake World, drama, remarkable as being the only commencing with an invocation to follows the lines of the legend as laid.\n\nRAV\u00c2HANA (Kath\u00e2 Sarit S\u00e2gara, Tar\u00e2nga 22, \u015aloka 16).\n\nled the Snowclad on this earth form, the chief of hills, \u2014of Gaur\u00ee's spouse. In that great mount, Vidy\u00e2dharas, once dwelt \u00fbtaketu. To his house \"ishing tree,\" the legacy, from its nature called desires.\" Then the king cherished that heaven-sent tree and said, tones: \"O deity!\nWho ever grantest all we ask or seek,\nGive me, I pray thee, now, a virtuous son,\nFor I am childless.\u201d \u201cKing,\u201d replied the tree,\n\u201cThy prayer is granted, thou shalt have a son;\nWithin his mind shall dwell the memory\nOf former births; he shall be liberal,\nThe lover of all creatures.\u201d Then the king,\nFilled with delight, in adoration bowed\nBefore the tree, and straightway to his Queen\nBore the glad tidings. Soon a son was born,\nAnd to the boy the father gave the name\nJim\u016btav\u0101hana. As time went on\nThe youth increased in stature, while the love\nWhich filled his inmost nature, step by step,\nGrew with his outward form. At last, the prince,\nProclaimed Successor to his father\u2019s crown,\nFilled with compassion for all living things\nThat move upon this earth, in secret spoke,\nAnd thus addressed his father, who with joy\nHeard his son\u2019s words. \u201cSurely I know full well\nThat all things perish: nothing on the earth\nHas an abiding place; one thing alone,\u2014\nThe glory of the virtuous, replete\nWith purity,\u2014though countless ages pass,\nShall never fail. If men of noble mind\nHave gained renown by showering kindnesses\nOn others, more than life, far more than wealth,\nThey value that fair glory. As for us\u2014\nIf our good fortune\u2014our prosperity\u2014\nBe for ourselves alone, nor overflow\nOn the less fortunate, then like a flash\nOf lightning shall our fortune pass away,\nAnd vanish into air. This \u2018Wishing tree\u2019\nGrants all that we desire; if, then, we pray\nThe tree to pour its blessings o\u2019er the world,\nNor keep them selfishly,\u2014then shall its fruit\nBe ours indeed. So let me supplicate\nThe wishing tree that by its boundless wealth\ndes of men, who pass their lives may be relieved.\u201d Thus spoke \u0100\u015ba: gladly his sire d the youth invoked the tree. us tree!

There the youth abode\nWithin a grove, the Siddha\u2019s dwelling-place,\nWhere trees of sandal shadowed o\u2019er the brooks,\nMaking his father\u2019s life his chiefest care.\nAnd while he sojourned there, the Siddha prince,\nOne Mitr\u00e2vasu, took him as a friend,\nWhose maiden sister in a former birth\nHad loved Jim\u00fbtav\u00e2hana. He saw,\nAnd filled with perfect wisdom knew again\nThe damsel he had loved. Their mutual glance,\nLike the frail meshes of the net which holds\nThe captive deer, ensnared each other\u2019s souls.\n\nOne day the Siddha prince, his countenance\nBeaming with joy, in sudden thought addressed\nJim\u00fbtav\u00e2hana, whom the three worlds\nAdored: \u201cA younger sister dwells with me,\nCalled Malayavat\u00ee: to thee I give\nThe maiden; O! do not refuse my gift!\u201d\nThen spoke Jim\u00fbtav\u00e2hana, and said:\n\u201cPrince! in a former birth she was my wife,\nThou too my friend, even as dear to me\nAs my own heart; to me is given the power\nOf calling back to mind births past and gone.\u201d\nThen Mitr\u00e2vasu said: \u201cTell me, I pray,\nThe story of thy former births, I long\nTo hear it.\u201d And Jim\u00fbtav\u00e2hana,\nrds all creatures, answered:\nmy tale: Once in a former birth\nhara, flying through space,\n\u015b\u0101laya, whose lofty peaks\nbeneath me, and I was beheld\nting with his spouse.

But while he thought\nThereon, a voice from heaven said: 'O king!\nHurt not thyself! Ask of me what thou wilt,\nIt shall be granted thee, for thou hast been\nApproved of me.' Then filled with joy the king\nReplied: 'Since thou, O goddess, hast approved\nMy deeds, what should I further need? but yet\u2014\nOne thing I ask of thee: in births to come,\nMay love between me and the merchant's son\nEver remain unchanged.' 'It shall be so,'\nAnswered the goddess. Then the Savara\nRestored me to my home loaded with wealth.\nMy father, seeing that I had returned\nFrom a far-distant land, the jaws of death\nBarely escaped, held a great festival\nTo do me honour. Then I saw again\nAfter some time had passed the Savara chief\nLed in a prisoner before the king\nFor sentence and for punishment: his crime\nThe plunder of a caravan. Straightway\nI told my father, and I prayed the king\nTo spare the Savara. My prayer was heard\nAnd with a mighty sum of gold I saved\nThe Savara chief from death. Thus I repaid\nHis benefits, and to my own abode\nI brought him home, and long I tended him\nWith loving care. After a time he turned\nDeparting to his village, while his heart\nTender with love was fixed upon me still.\nAnd then he roamed the earth, seeking a gift\nWorthy the kindnesses which I had showed\nTowards him.

When nightfall came,\nThe Savara departed, bearing me\nAlong with him.

Behind\nThe pair there followed one in soldier's garb,\nWho led the man up to a lofty rock\nAnd left him. Then Jimutavahana\nSpoke to the man and said, \"Tell me, I pray,\nWho art thou? Why does this thy mother weep\nFor thee?\" Then said the man, \"In bygone times\nKadr\u00fb and Vinat\u00e2, Kasyapa's wives,\nHeld a dispute.

Thus each agreed.\nThe subtle-minded Kadr\u00fb, fully bent\nOn victory, induced her sons the snakes\nTo send forth showers of venom o'er the steeds;\nAnd then she showed them all defiled and black\nTo Vinat\u00e2. So by an artifice\nWas Vinat\u00e2 o'ercome and made a slave.\nHow terrible is woman's spite which wreaks\nVengeance upon its kind.

Soon this snake returned\nFresh from Gokarna's shrine, and when he saw\nThe rock of death wet with the drops of blood,\n\"Surely the mighty-minded one, (he thought)\nHas offered up his life to ransom mine.\nOh, whither has Garu\u1e0da borne him hence?\nLo! I will search for him, it may so chance\nThat I may find him.\" Following the track\nLeft by the drops of blood, the serpent went.\nMeanwhile Garu\u1e0da with amazement saw\nThat gladness filled Jim\u016btav\u0101hana.\nHe ceased to eat him, and within himself\nHe thought:\u2014\"Who can this be? This must be one\nTo whom I have no right; for misery\nHas no abode within his constant mind.\nLo! he rejoices in his fate!\" Then said\nJim\u016btav\u0101hana, upon his aim\nIntent:\u2014\"O King of birds! there still remains\nWithin my body flesh and blood: I pray\nWhy hast thou ceased to feed upon my form,\nSeeing thy hunger is not satisfied?\"\nFilled with astonishment, the King of birds\nCeased from his meal, and said, \"O! mighty one!\nSurely thou art no snake; I pray thee, say,\nWho art thou?\" Then Jim\u016btav\u0101hana\n(His answer just begun, \"I am a snake!\nEat me, I pray, for men of constant mind\nWith perseverance carry through the task\nThey have in hand,\") heard from afar the voice\nOf Sankach\u016b\u1e0da, \"King of birds! desist!\nI am the snake prepared for thee! Alas!\nHow camest thou in recklessness and haste\nTo err so grievously?\" Confusion seized\nGaru\u1e0da, and Jim\u016btav\u0101hana\ne with grief, for his desire unfulfilled.

Then to heaven ing down nectar, to revive prince, and to restore to life who had perished, and whose bones t. Then Gaur\u00ee came from heaven n, and on the mighty one th showers of nectar: and his limbs, greater beauty than before, back to him, while through the sky music rang, and all the gods rud\u00e2, too, returned from heaven, nectar; and along the shore he life-giving drops. And lo! that had perished, once again d with the forms that they had worn\nIn life, and filled that forest by the shore\u2014\nCrowds upon crowds of serpents pressing on;\u2014\nIt seemed even as though the serpent world,\nForgetting their dread enemy, had come\nTo see and honour their deliverer.\nAnd round Jim\u00fbtv\u00e2hana his friends,\nHis wife, his parents, clustered, and they praised\nHim for his glory, and undying fame.\nCould aught but triumph reign in word or thought\nSince joy had banished pain. Then to his home,\nTogether with his wife, and friend, and son,\nJim\u00fbtv\u00e2hana, compassionate\nTowards all living things, departing, reigned\nThe sovereign lord of the Vidy\u00e2dharas.\n\nThe Story of Har\u00eesarman (Kath\u00e2 Sarit S\u00e2gara, Tar\u00e2nga 30, \u015aloka 92).\n\nOnce on a time within a certain town\nThere lived a Br\u00e2hman; he was very poor,\nAnd foolish too. Moreover, he had naught\nWherewith to earn a livelihood; his case\nWas altogether very bad. Besides he had\nNo end of children; thus the deity\nWould punish him for all the wicked deeds\nCommitted in some former life. So then\nThe Br\u00e2hman (Har\u00eesarman was his name)\nWandered about, with all his family,\nTo beg for alms: and in his wanderings\nHe chanced upon a village. There he stayed,\nAnd in a rich householder's family\nHe entered into service. While his sons\nTended the cows, and kept their master's goods,\nHis wife served him, and in a dwelling near\nHe lived himself, performing day by day\nThe tasks appointed in his master's house.\nlaughter of the householder\nand a mighty feast was made,\nrom far and near invited came.\nBr\u0101hman pleased, because he thought\nI cram himself up to the throat\n; but no one remembered him\nto the feast. When night had come,\nstress because his hopes had failed,\nwife to him :\u2014\"Stupid,\" he said,\nI: men therefore with disdain\nnow by an artifice\nthem, and I shall appear\nerning. This must be your part\nster, when you have the chance,\nned in magic art. Respect\npaid me.\" So a plan he formed\ny night he stole the horse\nbridegroom rode. When morning came,\ni's men searched far and near, but found\narisarman had concealed\nme far-distant place. Then came\nwife and said, \"Why not consult\nfor he knows astrology\nences. Lo! he will find\nou.\" Therefore the householder\ns to ask the Br\u0101hman's help.\nan said, \"To-day the horse\nou call me to your house,\nerday, I was ignored.\"\nardon,\" said the householder,\nforget:\"\u2014with such like words\nthe Br\u0101hman's wrath, and said,\na is the horse?\" The Br\u0101hman drew\nms, and feigned to make\ns. \"You will find the horse\nin such and such a place,\nich him home, before the thieves\ncher.\" Then they went and found\nThe horse and brought him back, praising the skill\nOf Har\u00edsarman. All men honoured him\nAnd took him for a sage. It came to pass\nAfter some time the palace of the king\nWas entered by a thief, who carried off\nJewels and gold. Now Har\u00edsarman's fame\nHad reached the royal ears, therefore the king\nSent for the Br\u00e1hman. He, when, summoned came,\nBut gave no answer, trying to evade\nThe question. \"When to-morrow comes,\" he said,\n\"An answer I will give you.\" Then the king\nLocked Har\u00edsarman up within a room\nAnd placed a watch. Filled with despondency,\nThe Br\u00e1hman thought but little would avail\nAll his pretended wisdom. In that place\nThere was a maid called Jihv\u00e2; it so chanced\nThat she, helped by her brother, was the thief.\nThis maid, o'ercome with terror at the skill\nOf Har\u00edsarman, listened at the door\nBy night, intent on finding out, if possible,\nWhat he might be about. Just at that time\nThe Br\u00e1hman, who was in the room alone,\nTaking to task his tongue, which had assumed\nTo know that which it knew not, said:\u2014\"Alas!\nO Jihv\u00e2! What is this that thou hast done\nThrough lust of pleasure? Evil one! Endure\nThy punishment.\" The servant, terrified,\nThought that her crime was known, and entering in,\nFell at the Br\u00e1hman's feet, whom she supposed\nTo have all knowledge, and she said:\u2014\"O Sir!\n'Tis true! I am the thief! I Jihv\u00e2 stole\nThe gold and jewels, and I buried them\nUnder the roots of a pomegranate tree\nBehind the palace. Take the gold I pray\nWhich I have left, and spare me, I confess\nMy crime.\" When Har\u00edsarman heard these words,\n\n1 Jihv\u00e2 means 'tongue,' as well as being a proper name.\nhaughtiness: \"I know all this! future, past, and present lie; but I will not denounce thief, because you are a wretch plored my mercy. Bring to me d you have.\" Without delay arted. Then the Br\u0101hman thought That which seemed impossible nplished, as it were in sport,\u2014posed to me. Calamity it hand, but yet I have attained d my hopes. I blamed my tongue, ll my ills, when suddenly y feet Jihv\u0101 the thief Secret crimes are brought to light re) by fear.\" With thoughts like these night rejoicing. Morning dawned, ed the king, with much pretence the garden where the gold ealed. Showing him what remained, ief had carried part away. king delighted, and he gave honours and rewards. n, the chief minister, g in private, whispering 'How should a man possess this, which ordinary men , seeing his ignorance. right of the \u015aastras,\u2014of the books ence.

If you guess\nArigh, then will I honour you indeed.\"\nThe Br\u00e2hman heard these words, and thought his end\nHad come at length: then rose within his mind\nThe name of \"frog,\" by which in sportiveness\nHis father used to call him; suddenly,\nImpelled by some divinity, he spoke,\nLamenting his untimely fate, and said,\nAddressing thus himself, \"Poor little frog!\nSurely this pitcher is the overthrow\nOf all your hopes, for on you in this place\nDestruction swiftly falls.\" Then all who heard\nThe Br\u00e2hman's words, with loud applause exclaimed,\n\"Indeed, a mighty sage! he even saw\nWithin the pitcher.\" Then, indeed, the king,\nThinking that Har\u00eesarman's skill was due\nTo magic art, gave to him villages\nAnd wealth, and outward marks of royal state.\nThe humble Br\u00e2hman thus became a prince.\nEurope. Its four sub-branches are the Ugric, Finn proper, Volga-Finn, and Perm-Finn. With the single exception of the Magyar, one of the languages of the Ugric sub-branch, all these sub-branches are confined to the north of Russia, viz. to Lapland, Finland, Livonia, Esthonia, part of K\u00farland, the northern banks of the Volga and the region between this well-watered district and the territory of the Samoy\u00e9d.\n\nII. Samoy\u00e9d represents the semi-barbarous tribes inhabiting the inhospitable shores of the Arctic Ocean from the Gulf of Kandalak to the river Obi.\n\nIII. M\u00e1nchu is divided into three sub-branches: M\u00e1nchu proper, occupying the country known as Manch\u00faria, north of Kor\u00e9a; T\u00fang\u00fas, spoken in a compact district around Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk; and Lamut, spoken by tribes leading a hard life in the district watered by the Upper Lena.\n\nThe Mongol Branch is spoken by a population altogether nomad. Its home is Mongolia; but immense bodies of Mongols are found in almost all parts of Central Asia and Southern Russia, from the Sea of Azov to Manch\u00faria. The Mongol who inhabit the south-eastern steppes of Russia are known generally as Kalm\u00fck.\n\nI now come to the fifth Branch, of which it is the object of this paper to give some more detailed account.\n\nThis Branch, for philological purposes, may be divided into five sub-branches, as follows:\n\n1. T\u00farki proper.\n2. Nogai.\n3. Uig\u00far.\n4. Kirgh\u00edz.\n5. Yak\u00fat.\n\nEach of the sub-Branches is distinct from the other, and contains its own Languages. A few general remarks on the linguistic aspect of these sub-Branches may be a useful preface to my remarks on their geographical distribution.\n\n1. Phonetics. (A) There is an endless variety in the pronunciation of the vowels and consonants. There is hardly a single letter of the alphabet that has the same value in any\nen languages. We have here in this section ics an immense field for research.\n\nare very few which are pronounced alike in\n\nTo illustrate what I say take the word We have dakhee, daakhee, d'ha, taghee, tagee,\n\nnda, dagee, daagee, dagen, thagee, and da, in\n\nties. There are more than ten forms for 'or 'is.' A comparative dictionary of these would be a useful work.\n\nSome verbs are common to several Lan-\n\natives of these verbs may not be common uage. The same applies to words built on adjectives.\n\ncannot say that in the matter of structure al difference in the T\u00farki Languages. The s run through them all. Every sentence,\n\nvery one of the Languages must end with there are doubtless certain differences in the native and accusative terminations in several comparison of the adjective, in nomina\n\noles, in pronouns, and in the formation of om the verbs, but there is nothing radical e of the Languages from the rest of its\n\nOGRAPIICAL DISTRIBUTION.\n\nconvenient if, instead of taking each of es and treating it in its entirety, I were language in Geographical order, beginning moving eastwards, and indicating to which s the Language belongs.\n\ni. Nogai.\n\nr belongs to the Nogai sub-Branch. The umber about 190,000. The most westerly ive reached is the Russian province of hey occupy about twenty villages. They\ngraphical Distribution of the Modern T\u00fcrki\nby M. A. Morrison, Esq., Agent to the\nforeign Bible Society in South Russia.\n\nCust, Esq., Hon. Secretary R.A.S., with a Note, Table\nAuthorities, and a Language-Map.\n\nI address myself in this paper is the\nibution of the T\u00fcrki languages. But\night be well to glance at the whole Ugro-\nder to determine the position of the T\u00fcrki\nat division of the languages of the human\n\nbut with sufficient accuracy, the Ugro-\ne spoken over a region extending through\nrees of longitude, from the shores of the\nreat Wall of China and the plateau of\n35 degrees of latitude, from the frozen\nand Yak\u00fat to the plains of Northern\nwaters of the Indus.\n\nspoken over this vast portion of the\n, for philological purposes, divided into\nes. They are:\n\n1. Finn.\n2. Samoy\u00e9d.\n3. M\u00e1nchu.\n4. Mong\u00f3l.\n5. T\u00fcrki.\n\nof the various languages which compose\nhes I have nothing to do at present. A\nhowever, descriptive of their geographical\nnd useful.\n\nroup is almost altogether confined to\nof Azerbij\u00e1n, Ghilan, and Maz\u00e1ndaran, this is the vernacular. It is a peculiar and corrupt form. For philologists it has none of the value of the more archaic languages, e.g. the Vig\u00far. German missionaries, stationed in Shusha, about the year 1830, were the first to reduce to paper its grammatical principles. In this they were assisted by a most able Armenian linguist, Mirza Fer\u00fakh.\n\nvii. Bashkir.\n\nAgain going north to Astrakhan on the Volga delta, we enter the country of the Bashk\u00edr. If we draw a line from Astrakhan north-east to Orenburg, and thence due north to Ufa and Perm, we bisect the country of the Bashk\u00edr into two not very unequal parts. The Bashk\u00edr are most compact in the neighbourhood of Ufa, which is really a Bashk\u00edr town. They number some 400,000, and are mostly settled. Their language belongs to the Nogai sub-Branch. Ethnologists are divided in opinion about the origin of the race, but the best authorities are agreed that, although the race may be of Mongol origin, the language is T\u00farki.\n\nviii. Trans-Caspian.\n\nThis is a very widely dispersed language. It is spoken by about 2,300,000 people. Going from west to east we see it spoken by the Tekke in the rich pasture plains lying between the northern slopes of the Kopet hills and the desert, and in that long strip of the Arkatch valley north of the Kuren Dagh. But in addition it is also the language of the ruling natives in Samarkand, Tashkent, Bukh\u00e1ra, Charj\u00fai, Kokan, Ferghana, Balkh, and the populous Zarafshan valley. In other words it is the language of the great Uzbek nation. The 92 clans of the Uzbek are scattered over all that part of Central Asia in which the towns just named are situated. It is also the language of the Salor and Sarik tribes of north-west Afghanistan; also of the Kiptchak dwelling north of the Naryn river, and in the district\ntant town of Andijan. It belongs to the h. Although it is somewhat corrupted by of Persian, it retains the ancient forms of fully than either the Bashk\u00edr or Azerbij\u00e1n\u00ed. these districts wishes to speak in a more or to write a letter or document, he uses of the T\u00e1jik or else pure Persian. As language, the name Jagatai is little known in the Uzbek say that they speak \u2018T\u00farki.\u2019 The derived from Jagat, that son of Jengh\u00edz he portion of Turkestan now inhabited by ven by his father.\n\nix. Khivan.\n\nalso belongs to the Uig\u00far sub-Branch. It t 1\u00bd million in the Khanate of Khiva and rt between the Amu Daria and the Caspian. re included 150,000 nomad Yomut inhabi nd the Kara-Kalpak, numbering perhaps round the southern shores of the Sea of man, who form the bulk of the population guage, must have broken off at a very early riginal home of the race among the Altai. is marked affinities with the most archaic language.\n\nx. Kirghtz.\n\nof the five sub-Branches is so free from s as the Kirgh\u00edz. The language spoken the lower Volga and that spoken in the en Shan mountains are one and the same, nearer to the Western T\u00farki than the ibes of the Caucasus and Western Caspian ly nearer than the language of Yarkand. on consists of two great divisions, the irgh\u00edz, who are highlanders confined to\nthe Altai, Pamir, and Thien Shan mountains, and to that part of Eastern Turkestan belonging to the Chinese Empire; and the Kaz\u00e1k-Kirgh\u00edz, dwellers on the plains, who roam with their sheep and camels over half a million of square miles from the Caspian to Lake Tenghiz. The Kaz\u00e1k or western division are far more numerous and powerful than the Kara-Kirgh\u00edz, and are subdivided into the well-known Lesser, Middle, and Greater Horde. The Greater Horde, which borders on the territory of the Kara, inhabits the Alatau district. The Middle Horde is scattered over the whole of south-west Siberia in the territory north and west of Lake Balkhash between the Upper Syr Daria and the Irtish, and is bounded on the west by the Sarisoa. The Lesser Horde is as far west as the Caspian and Ural Mountains, and meets the Middle Horde on the Syr Daria and Yemba. There is yet another Horde confined to Russia called the Inner or Bukcieff Horde. They dwell on the steppe between the Volga and Ural. There is moreover a considerable Kirgh\u00edz population in the government of Orenburg. Ethnologists are not yet able to decide whether they belong to the Mongol or to the T\u00farki race. They number altogether a little over 2,000,000. The Kaz\u00e1k or Western Kirgh\u00edz has been called 'Orenburg Tartar,' for the same reason that the Nogai has been called 'Karass': a Scotch Missionary resident in Orenburg translated portions of the Scriptures into Kaz\u00e1k-Kirgh\u00edz. I may add that the translation gives an excellent idea of the written form of this dialect.\n\nxi. Yak\u00fat.\n\nFor the purposes of the philologist this is perhaps the most important of any of the languages, inasmuch as it has preserved its ancient forms untouched by the influence of foreign idioms. It is the language on which B\u00f6htlingk wrote his celebrated monograph. The tribes speaking Yak\u00fat inhabit the far north-east corner of Siberia, and number about 200,000. It is pretty certain that at some unknown time they have migrated to that secluded region from the\nBaikal. All their traditions agree with this Russian Orthodox Church has had a mission among the Yak\u00fat, but more than the half of their heathen usages.\n\nxii. Yarkandi.\n\nof Yarkand in Chinese Tartary and the Tien Shan mountains. We have here a form of T\u00fcrki. Vamb\u00e9ry considers that incontestably the most primitive words and first all T\u00fcrki forms of speech. It has attained alone, with the single exception of Osm\u00e1n\u00ed; literary culture. Early in the fifth century writing by the Chinese, and in the eighth missionaries from Syria formed an alphabet. Speaking this Language numbers nearly\n\nxiii. Taranchi.\n\naron Kaulbars the Taranchi number some settled in Kulja and in small agricultural land. They are probably emigrants from , settled in their present territory by the rent. Radloff says of the Taranchi that of any of the Central Asian Turkish especially Turkish than any Turkish book initnople.\u201d It belongs to the Uig\u00far sub- is derived from the Turkish word Taran ranchi are skilful agriculturists; hence, ellation.\n\nxiv.

I had hoped to prevail on my friend Arminius Vamb\u00e9ry to write a paper for this Journal on the subject, and no one is more competent to deal with it, but the Council declined to offer any remuneration, and so the negotiation dropped, which I had commenced at Buda Pest in 1883. Pavet de Courteille of Paris, at my request wrote a paper on the subject in the Transactions of the Philological Society, 1877; but, as it appeared to me to be rather a Geographical than a Philological subject, I went down in the autumn of 1883 to Tiflis, to talk over the matter with Mr.\nI, the Agent of the British and Foreign\nand his learned colleague, the Rev. Amir-\nI found engaged in the translation of the\nthe T\u00farki spoken in Trans-Caucasus and\north-West Province of Persia. This was\nask for a profound scholar in his study in\nperson engaged in Asia in distributing the\nhorde in the Language intelligible to them.\non visited London last year, we talked over\n, and fixed approximately the number of\nconsider this sketch to be only tentative,\nvance towards the final settlement of this\n\nn Vamb\u00e9ry that though he calls the\nthree Khanates of the Oxus the Jagatai,\ny marked Dialects at Kokan, Bokh\u00e1ra,\nin each case by the peculiarities of each\nassigns to Khiva the place of a separate\ng the two other Khanates under the same\nTekke. This may or may not be accurate.\nelligible, and therefore easily susceptible of\nhowever quote no authority.\n\nef published, at St. Petersburg, 1875,\nTurkish (Osm\u00e1nli), Persian, Kirgh\u00edz and\nas spoken in Central Asia, followed by a\nUzbek he means the two Languages\npaper as Trans-Caspian and Khivan, and\nTurkest\u00e1ni; but this would be going too\nassuming a name for one portion of the\ns to the whole field. He admits that the\nKhiva is differentiated from the Dialect of\nkend, owing to the contact of the former\nii. At the time that he wrote he knew\nguage of Yarkand and Kashgar, as Shaw\nis Grammar, and he knew nothing also\nhe Tekke of Merw, that country being at\nand unconquered. Every Russian hates\nigarian, and Terantief, as was to be\nexpected, attacks the \"Jagataische Sprach Studien,\" but Scholars will probably agree with Vamb\u00e9ry. Radloff is of opinion that a single version of the Scriptures will be understood by the populations of Turkestan (Tashkent), Bokh\u00e1ra, Khiva and Kokan, amounting to two or three millions. A competent scholar, Ostramof, is engaged in the translation of the Gospels: his work has been submitted to Radloff, who is entirely satisfied with it. It will be carried out at the expense of the English Bible Society, and a large issue published and distributed; and the question as to the Language spoken in these Regions will be settled by the test of experience. Schuyler, who is a trustworthy authority, in his Travels entirely supports the same view as Terantief.\n\nI have had a Language Map prepared, and add a table of Authorities or Texts, as the best proof of the existence of the Language and Family, and the best means of differentiating them.\n\nRegarding their written Character, it may be noted that some of these are perfectly illiterate. The Osm\u00e1nli, the Azerbij\u00e1ni, Kum\u00fck, Kirgh\u00edz, Nogai, Yarkandi, Khivan, and Trans-Caspian use the Arabic Character partially or entirely. Vamb\u00e9ry tells us that among the Kirgh\u00edz the Mongolian Character is in use, and that the Mulla, who visit these Nomads for the purpose of propagating the Mahometan Faith, do not hesitate to use for that purpose the Character, which on other occasions they call the K\u00e1fir Character, and the use of which they try to suppress elsewhere. We find also that there are certain people who speak the T\u00farki, but read only the Armenian Character, and an Edition of the Bible has been published to suit their convenience. The Chuw\u00e1sh tribes have been educated to read their Bible in the Russian Character, and are supplied with an Edition. The Osm\u00e1nli T\u00farki Language has been made the instrument of Religious Instruction to some of the Greek subjects of the Ottoman Empire, who have forgotten their glorious language, but from mere racial and theological hate will only use the Greek Character, and the entire Bible has been supplied to them in the Alpha Beta of Hellas. The Yak\u00fat,\nn subjects of Russia, apparently use the\nto judge from the texts given by B\u00f6htlingk.\nibt no finality as yet arrived at. In dealing\nmust expect the Dialects to fluctuate.

The\nancient form in which the T\u00farki speech\nted language, while the languages of the\nn, which may be called the Altaic, and\nwhich are totally illiterate, present the most primitive form of words and forms. There exists a manuscript, known as the Kudatku Bilik, the date of which is fixed at the latter half of the eleventh century of the Christian era: this is stated by some to be the oldest record, and is in Uig\u00fbr. Vamb\u00e9ry makes it the basis of his investigations. Though late in date compared with the literary monuments of the Aryan and Semitic Families, it is of great importance, as it is the most pure specimen of real T\u00fbrki, free from the influences of the Persian and Arabic languages, and worthy to be considered the typical language.\n\nWe have now to inquire what Jagatai is. One of the most remarkable writers on the subject of the Turki tribes is Abul Gh\u00e2zi of Khiva, who wrote a book called \"The Genealogical History of the Tatars.\" He lived at Khiva in the seventeenth century of our era, and he remarks that he wrote his book in T\u00fbrki, in order that all might understand him, and that he employed words which a child of the age of five years would comprehend, and that he rejected all loan-words from Jagatai, Persian, and Arabic. This shows that the language, which he used, was not called Jagatai, in his time, but that he used what he deemed pure Turki. Pavet de Courteille comes to the following conclusion: that the Jagatai was the language, in which the Kudatk\u00fb-Bilik was written, and was, in fact, the language in its most ancient form, and in the region nearest to its birthplace. Abul Gh\u00e2zi would not allow himself to use antique words, which were intelligible in the eleventh century, but which had fallen into desuetude in the seventeenth, and were only known to the learned. The literature of every country supplies an analogy of this process. The words Jagatai and Uig\u00fbr only indicate differences of age, and stages of dialectic variation, through which the T\u00fbrki language passed. Shaw confirms this view, and writes that though some European linguists have called the T\u00fbrki of Kashgar and Yarkand Uig\u00fbr, the name is totally unknown to the people, and would be a misnomer for a modern language. Terantief confirms this view. The term should be abandoned. Vamb\u00e9ry,\nhe Sprache, goes so far as to state that it\nthe word \"Jagatai Turki\" means nothing\ne Turki,\" just as the word Jagatai coupled\nman\" means a \"brave, trustworthy man.\"\no catch up all the names which are scattered\nks of reference, which are sometimes tribal,\nsometimes synonyms, sometimes artificial.\nheir place under one or other of the Geo-\nnow supplied. Karachai and Kabarda in\nregion, Kapchak on the Lower Volga, and\nsoxania, are tribal names. Chantu is\nT\u00farki. Tatar, converted by the wit of a\nr, is identical with T\u00farki (J.R.A.S. n.s.\n125). Alatyan is identical with Altaic.\nMeshtsheria, Tobolsk, Chasowo, Chjulim,\nBaraba, Kangayen, Teleut, Chiwa, are sup-\nin the T\u00farki chapter of his Language\nlyglotta, published at Paris, 1822.

We have got beyond the\nlike to know the latitude and longitude,\nof the compiler, as well as his method of\n\nremark that the whole of the T\u00farki-speaking\nworld is slowly, but surely, gravitating\nomination. A few corners still lie outside\nfluence, but they seem tottering on the\nsm. The Taranchi of Kulja, and the\ngaria are still in the Chinese dominions;\no inhabit the regions behind the Oxus and\nare still in Afghanistan: the Province of\npart of the Persian kingdom, and Asia\nttoman Empire: but this state of affairs\nis only for a time. Every fragment of the Indic branch of the Aryan Family of Languages, with the exception of the rude form of speech of the Siah Posh of Kafiristan and the Dards, has been absorbed into the Indian Empire; the same fate of being gathered under one sceptre awaits the whole of the widely-scattered T\u00farki tribes, and it is a notable fact for the future, since unity of language is put forward as the basis of political union.\n\nHow far the Russians possess the necessary sympathy for such a task, and the capacity for educating such a population, nomad, as well as sedentary, is a question. The Russian language, with its ponderous word-store, and illogical Aryan structure, has but slight attraction to the agglutinative and severely logical T\u00farki, which stands at the head of all languages in its wonderful symmetry and power of form, evolution or accommodation. Perhaps the B\u00e1ntu family of South Africa alone can rival it. Of the kind of words, which will come into existence from the contact of such uncongenial elements as Russ and T\u00farki we have a specimen in the name of a son of a Kirgh\u00edz chief in the Russian service, Vali Khan, who has assumed the name of Valikhanoff. In India we should hardly call the son of Gulab Singh, Gulabsinghson, but such words may hereafter be formed.\n\nHow the subtle poison of the Arabized Persian language has found its way into the veins of the linguistic body of the Osm\u00e1nli T\u00farki is well known, but it is surprising to find in the distant and secluded language of Yarkandi in Chinese Tartary the same infiltration of foreign elements, though to a less degree. The celebrated Uig\u00far Manuscript is quite free from this contagion. The presence of a T\u00e1j\u00edk servile population would supply the Persian element, and the conquering Religion of Mahomet would force into use Arabic words and forms. But we have the authority of Vamb\u00e9ry for asserting that it was quite unnecessary for the Osm\u00e1nli language to make such prodigious loans from Arabic and Persian, as it had in its own T\u00farki root-store and expanding mechanism, a capability of expressing every human idea, and could at pleasure replace every foreign word by drawing\nres; and, in fact, the East-Turki languages\na very great extent. We find the same\nomena in the marvellously beautiful and\nranca of India, the Urd\u00fa, or Hindust\u00e1ni, in\nth of word-store and grammatical forms of\nritic Vernaculars, and the high degree of\nthe pure Indian literature had reached long\nnetan Conquest, which rendered loan-words\ny. The very word \"Urd\u00fa\" marks the\nIndia by the Mughals. The Baber-namah\nler of that dynasty is in Jagatai. A certain\nords, though not many, have survived in\nvernacular. The word Turk survives in\nictionary in connection with horses and\ne with the proverb:\n\n\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc \u0627\u0635\u0644 \u0639\u0631\u0628\u06cc \u0634\u06a9\u0631\n\u062a\u0631\u06a9\u06cc \u0647\u0646\u0631 \u0647\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u0646\u0647\u06a9\n\nthe root: Persian is the sugar:\nthe salt: Turki is the art.\n\nis a Scientific Comparative Grammar of\nworthy to be placed on the same shelf with\ngrammars of other families of speech which\n, and it is stated on good authority that\ng such a work.\nI.

This though foreshadowed in the preface to the \"T\u0101rikh Guz\u012bdah,\" has hitherto remained a mystery to European scholars; and it is to the chill of Tehran (who now describes the f Riz\u0101 Kuli) that the credit of securing it for Museum belongs.

The latter does not concern us now, and it will suffice here to refer to the line of famous poets in that language, commencing with Ch\u0101ng\u012b D\u0101s, who lived in the fifteenth century A.D.\n\nB\u0101r'w\u0101r\u012b, the border dialect between Br\u0101j Bh\u0101sh\u0101, the parent of modern Hindi on the west, and Bih\u0101r\u012b on the east, and partaking of the peculiarities of both these languages, was admirably adapted to serve the purposes of a poet, who could be read, understood, and loved over the whole of Hindust\u0101n, and such a poet arose in the famous Tuls\u012b D\u0101s, who wrote almost entirely in that dialect. He was followed by a host of imitators, down to the present day, and hence it follows that Bais'w\u0101r\u012b has a literature which, if collected together, would fill a good-sized library.\n\nAt the same time, Br\u0101j Bh\u0101sh\u0101, the language to the west of B\u0101r'w\u0101r\u012b, and not falling within North-East Hindust\u0101n, developed a literature of its own, founded, while the language was almost yet a Prakrit, by Chand Bard\u0101i, who was followed, long afterwards, by Sur D\u0101s and his imitators.\n\nHindi, i.e., the book Hindi of the present day, did not exist till the English conquest. Early in the present century it was manufactured by order of Government, out of Urdu, by the substitution of Sanskrit for Arabic and Persian words.\n\n---\n\nThe only poem of Tuls\u012b D\u0101s, with which I am acquainted, and which is not written in B\u0101r'w\u0101r\u012b, is the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-haribh\u0101r, which he wrote, as the subject and theme are quoted in Br\u0101j Bih\u0101r\u012b. Sur D\u0101s, who wrote only about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, wrote in Br\u0101j Bih\u0101r\u012b, and Tuls\u012b D\u0101s, the \"god of R\u0101m,\" in B\u0101r'w\u0101r\u012b, and it seems to have been a very natural event, far back as the time of the latter poet, that if he mentioned the former hero must therefore be written in Br\u0101j, and those common to both hero in B\u0101r'w\u0101r\u012b. So prevalent and fixed into this idea became that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke the M\u0101nasa poet, who wrote only about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in the Madh\u0101vi dialect, declared by Raj\u0101l\u0101 historians to have written in Br\u0101j, a language different from M\u0101nasa. German is from English? The argument can be made by reasoning like this. Any poems about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a must be in Br\u0101j, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke only about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, therefore (although they admittedly did not perceive) must speak they are in Br\u0101j.\nBooks were concocted in this language, and it remained the officially-recognized literary id\u016bst\u0101n. Nowhere is it a vernacular, and it is not from the language of Bih\u0101r. At the closely connected, through its parent \u016ard\u016b, \u0101, and hence is well suited to be the literary has really become, of North-Western India.\n\nLanguage to the east of Bais\u2019w\u0101r\u012b, was not Braj Bh\u0101sh\u0101. It is true it had one great who flourished at the end of the fourteenth wrote in Maithili, the extreme eastern dialect ad not many followers in his own country. His principal imitators were Bang\u0101lis who, of Ch\u0101it\u0101nya, a great admirer of the old wrote a number of works in the spurious n the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-pada-kalpa-taru, a Bang\u0101li u\u1e63\u1e47ava litanies.\n\nLiterature, though old, is small in extent, for other dialects (Magah\u012b and Bhoj\u2019p\u016bri) de poet strong enough to found a school of people, however, has not poems by great have songs, and so we find abundant stores nds, some original, and some translated from n these last two dialects. The peculiarity is that the fetters of metre lie upon them d. Bidy\u0101pati and Tul\u2019s\u012b D\u0101s wrote accord t rules of Pingala, measuring the quantity but in these other songs the melody to ing is the only guide, and so long as the ictus is provided for, the author cared little les were long or short. Their measure was well-known metre, as was necessary, for all ilodies are written to suit such; but in given here, it will often be necessary to\n\nnsidered as a dialect of Bih\u0101r\u012b, but it is really, as already lect, though nearer related to Bih\u0101r\u012b than to Braj. work which is usually quoted is published by Be\u1e47\u012b 1866.\nread long syllables as short, and sometimes even the contrary, in order to read them as the poet would have them read.\n\nMany of these songs are of considerable length. For instance, the cycle of ballads concerning the heroes \u0100lh\u0101 and R\u016bdal extends over many thousand lines, and again the Song of Bij\u0101\u012b Mall, or of N\u0101ik\u0101 Banijar'w\u0101, though shorter, still takes some hours to sing through. These longer songs, however, are the property of professional singers. It is a business to sing one, and a treat, equivalent in Europe to going to the opera, to hear one. The professional singer or n\u0101t sits in the dusk of an Indian cold weather, by the straw fire, and is well plied with spirits as he sings his song to the circle of hearers sitting silently round him smoking their bubble-bubbles.\n\nIf these longer songs can be compared to the opera, the shorter ones can be equally well likened to the drawing-room piece. Every stout young fellow with good lungs has a repertoire of them, out of which he sings whenever he has nothing better to do, whether alone or in company. He has probably only one tune, to which he fits all his words; and as the tune wanders about through all keys, and generally has a cadenza of twenty or thirty notes every second or third syllable, it is difficult for the European, uneducated to native tastes, to catch what he sings. This paucity of melodies has often struck me. In the country districts I never heard of a new tune being invented. There seems to be a certain stock of tunes ready made, to which the words of every new song must be fitted. Thus, every mill-song must be sung to the melody called 'j\u0101t's\u0101r,' and such songs are classed as j\u0101t's\u0101rs. So certain songs sung in the month of Ch\u0101it are classed as gh\u0101t\u014ds, because they are sung to the tune called gh\u0101t\u014d, and the class of songs sung in the rainy season is called kaj'ri, which is the name of the air to which they are sung. Some castes have melodies peculiar to them. For instance, only cowherds (ahirs or go\u0101rs) sing the songs\n\n1 I do not know what is being done in Calcutta, where B\u0101b\u016b Sur\u0113ndra M\u014dhan Tagore has started a revival of Hind\u016b music.\nars and bir'h\u0101s, which are sung to the tunes\nnd bir'h\u0101 respectively.\n\nclass I have collected forty-two in the\nct alone, all sung to the same melody.\nortion of the present collection.

Many are the Bir'h\u0101s which describe the charms which adorn and the temptations which beset the pretty young village maidens whose forms are developing from childhood into womanhood. As in India girls are married in their infancy, these girls are all wives, though their husbands have not yet taken them home. Hence we find girls complaining of the non-arrival of their husband, and a number of not very delicate jokes which the village elders (men and women) launch at a girl when she first becomes apta viro. Sometimes, too, we find the girl, half-pleased, half-angry, relating the attentions paid to her by some village swain who met her as she walked through the forest. Again, we have songs referring to a woman's married life. She is now living in her husband's house, and she hyperbolically describes the slimness of her form, as reminding him of the string by which he lowers his drinking vessel into the well. Or, perhaps, as often happens, the husband is away on service and sends his earnings home, which are not always put to legitimate uses.\n\nEven when away from home on service, the cowherd longs for his congenial occupations, and looks back to the happy days when he wandered free over the rich pastures on the K\u0101m\u016br Hills.\\(^1\\) Or he looks contemptuously at the elaborate preparations of wrestlers and gymnasts, and tells how the young Ah\u012br would only need to tuck up his waist cloth, and could do just as much. There are many other kinds of Bir'h\u0101s in the present collection than those now described, but the above will serve to show their infinite variety, and how each one is a miniature picture of some phase of village life.\n\nRegarding external form, a Bir'h\u0101 consists of two pairs of two lines each, each pair being founded on the following scheme\n\n\\[\n6 + 4 + 4 + 2, \\quad 4 + 4 + 3 \\text{ instants,}\n\\]\n\nor else\n\n\\[\n6 + 4 + 4 + 2, \\quad 4 + 4 + 4 \\text{ instants.}\n\\]\n\n\\(^1\\) The principal pasture land of Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d.

The singular is frequently used for the plural and vice versa. As a rule the singular is used in a non-honorific or disrespectful sense, and the plural in an honorific or respectful sense. It should also be noted that the masculine is continually used for the feminine.\n\nThe rules for the shortening of the antepenultimate vowel are given at length in \u00a736 of the General Introduction to the seven grammars of the Bih\u0101r dialects, and in the introduction to the comparative dictionary of the Bih\u0101r\u012b language, and need not be repeated here. It may nevertheless be noted, that while in Bhoj\u2019p\u016br\u012b a long \u0906 \u0101 is usually shortened to \u0905 a, in these songs it is sometimes shortened to an older form \u0906 \u0101.\u00b9 Examples are \u0906\u092e\u093e\u091a\u0947 \u0101ma\u010d\u0113, from \u0906\u092e (18, 1), instead of \u0906\u092e\u093e\u091a\u093e \u0101ma\u010d\u0101,\u00b2 and \u0905\u0916\u093f\u0930\u094b akhir\u014d instead of \u0905\u0916\u093f\u0930 akhir (12, 4).\n\nSome masculine nouns, it may also be noted, are given feminine long forms in a diminutive sense. The instances of occurrence are given in the index. An example is \u0926\u0947\u0939\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0902 dehiy\u0101\u1e41 instead of \u0926\u0947\u0939\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0902 dehiy\u0101\u1e41 (22, 2; 26, 1).\n\nIn conclusion, I desire to record my obligations again to Babu Siv Nandan L\u0101l R\u0101y, Deputy Magistrate of Pat\u2019n\u0101, to whom I am indebted for much help in the collecting and translating of these songs.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Regarding the two pairs of vowels \u0906 \u0101 and \u0905 a, and \u0906 \u0101 and \u0905 a, see Introduction (Chap.

I would draw attention to it, as contradicting a theory put forward with some confidence in the Calcutta Review by B\u0101b\u016b Shy\u0101ma Charan\u0101 G\u0101nguli, to the effect that the songs of this poet are not known in the Bhoj'p\u016bri area. This song was written for me by a lady whose home is in Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d, in the heart of Bhoj'p\u016br. I am indebted to the kindness of her husband (a gentleman of position in Government service) for the copy. It describes how a cowherdess of Brind\u0101ban (V\u1e5bind\u0101vana) addresses \u016adh\u014d (Uddhava), who has come to her with a message from Krish'n (Kr\u012b\u1e63\u1e47a), who had left her and gone to Mathur\u0101 at the invitation of Kans (Kai\u1e45\u00e7a). The metre is very irregular, probably owing to the fact that the song was originally written in Maithili, and transformed in the course of centuries into Bhoj'p\u016bri, without regard to the quantities of the resultant syllables. The metre seems to have originally been $6+4+2$ instants, four times repeated; but in order to get this metre now a great many long syllables must be read as short ones. In one case, in order to scan, a whole word (\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e in verse 9) must be left out, and this can be done without spoiling the sense, as the word is a mere expletive. Some words bear their Maithili origin on their face, e.g. \u0905\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093f\u0939\u093f in verse 20, and \u0918\u0930\u0941\u0903 in verse 21. So also \u0938\u0941\u091a\u0941 in verse 20, which is Bhoj'p\u016bri 2 imper. fem., must, as the metre shows, originally have been \u0938\u0941\u091a\u0941, which is the regular Maithili imperat. for both genders.\n\u0909\u0939\u0930 \u091a\u0930\u0935\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u091c\u0927\u094b\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0924\u0940\u092f-\u092e\u093f\u0925\u093f \u092c\u093e\u0932\u0940 \u0965 \u0967 \u0965\n\u092f\u093e \u0932\u0947\u0902 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u0932\u094d\u0932\u094b\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u091c\u0927\u094b\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u092c\u0948\u0902\u091a\u0930\u093e \u0916\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0965 \u0968 \u0965\n'\u0939\u092e \u092c\u0928\u093f\u0924\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u091c\u0927\u094b\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u092a\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092c\u0948\u0902\u091a\u0947 \u091a\u094b\u0930\u0940 \u0965 \u0969 \u0965\n'\u0939\u092e \u0915\u0947 \u0922\u094b\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u091c\u0927\u094b\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u0918\u094b\u0902\u091a\u093f \u092c\u094c\u0902\u0927 \u092c\u0949\u0902\u0927\u093f\u0924\u0947\u0902 \u0965 \u096a \u0965\n'\u0939\u092e \u0915\u0947 \u0922\u094b\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u091c\u0927\u094b\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u091f\u0942\u091f\u093f \u092b\u093e\u091f\u093f \u092c\u0948\u0902\u091a\u0947 \u0965 \u096b \u0965\n'\u0939\u092e \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0917\u094d\u0939\u0932 \u092a\u093f\u092f\u0935\u093e\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u0938\u0947 \u0939\u094b \u092c\u093e\u0939\u094b\u0902 \u0926\u093f\u0916\u0947\u0902 \u0965 \u096c \u0965\n'\u0928\u093f \u0922\u0939\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u091c\u0927\u094b\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u092a\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0917\u0947\u0932 \u091a\u094b\u0930\u0940 \u0965 \u096d \u0965\n'\u0928\u093f \u0922\u0939\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u091c\u0927\u094b\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u092c\u0917\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092c\u0917\u093e\u0913\u0902 \u0965 \u096e \u0965\n'\u0917\u092f\u093e \u0915\u093e \u091a\u094b\u0924\u0947 \u0930\u0947 \u091a\u094b\u0924\u0947\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u092c\u0947\u0930\u093e \u0928\u0930\u0930\u0930 \u0916\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0965 \u096f \u0965\n'\u0932\u093e \u0938\u0938\u0941\u0930 \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u091c\u0927\u094b\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u092c\u0941\u091a\u0930\u093e \u092d\u0938\u0941\u0930\u093e \u0965 \u0967\u0966 \u0965\n'\u0915\u0947 \u092c\u0939\u0930 \u0930\u0947 \u0939\u094b\u0916\u0942\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u092c\u093e\u0916\u0947\u0932\u093e \u0928\u0947\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u0965 \u0967\u0967 \u0965\n'\u0930 \u0915\u0947 \u0928\u0947\u092a\u0941\u0930\u0935\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u091c\u0927\u094b\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u092b\u094c\u0902\u0921\u093c\u093f \u092c\u0949\u0902\u0927 \u092c\u0947\u0932 \u0965 \u0967\u0968 \u0965\n'\u092a\u093e \u091c\u094b\u092c\u0928\u0935\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u091c\u0927\u094b\n\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093e \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940 \u092c\u0917\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0965 \u0967\u0969 \u0965\nTranslation.\n\n1.

In transliterating Sanskrit words \u0913 is represented by \u00e7.\n\nThe following contractions are used:\n\nacc. = accusative.\nadj. = adjective.\nadv. = adverb.\ncaus. = causal.\ncond. = conditional.\nconj. = conjunctive or conjunction.\ndat. = dative.\ndir. = direct.\nemph. = emphatic.\nexplet. = expletive.\nfem. = feminine.\ngen. = genitive.\nimperat. = imperative.\ninstr. = instrumental.\ninterj. = interjection.\ninterrog. = interrogative.\nlg. f. = long form.\nloc. = locative.\nmasc. = masculine.\nm.c. = metri caus\u00e2.\nneut. = neuter.\nnom. = nominative.\nO. = old.\nobl. = oblique.\npart. = participle.\npass. = passive.\nperf. = perfect.\nperiphr. = periphrastic.\npoten. = potential.\npres. = present.\npret. = preterite.\npron. = pronoun.\nred. f. = redundant form.\nrel. = relative.\nresp. = respectful.\nstr. f. = strong form.\nsubst. = substantive.\nSOME BHOJ'PURI FOLK-SONGS.\n\n255\n\n\u0101n; gen. dir., an'kar, 45, 20; gen. obl., an'k\u0101, 13, 3.\n\u221a\u0101n; 1 v.n., obl., \u0101ne, 45, 2.\n\n2. \u0101m; lg. f., \u0101m'w\u0101, 18, 1; lg. f., instr., am'w\u014d, 38, 3.\n\u221a\u0101w; O. pres. 3, \u0101w\u0113, 47, 4; pret. 1, \u0101l\u012b, 11, 3; 47, 8; 2, \u0101l\u0113, 6, 3; \u0101l\u0101, 44, 15; 2 fem., \u0101lu, 47, 7; 3 \u0101l\u0113, 12, 3; 3 fem., \u0101l\u012b, 23, 1; imperat., 2, \u0101w\u0101, 45, 21; 2, fem., \u0101\u014d, 10, 4; perf., 3, \u0101l\u0113 h\u0101, 23, 2; 1 v.n., \u0101i (g\u0101il), 49, 2; 2 v.n., loc., \u0101l\u0113 (g\u0101ile), (from \u0101il (g\u0101il)), 44, 9.\n\u0101char.\n\u0101re, 47, 8.\n\u0101ho, 43, 18, 19.\n\n\u0101n, 17, 3 (\u0101pan 5, 9; 46, 3; gen. gen. obl., ap'n\u0101,\n\ni.\n\ni\u016b\u1e6di chi\u016b\u1e6di, 20, 1.\nichi, 45, 20.

Led by D\u0101ityas, who had obtained a boon to prevent them from being destroyed until the Hind\u016bs assumed the shape of animals. They had a reservoir containing am\u1e5bita, and when any of them was slain by the gods, his body was dipped in it, and he came back to life. Thereupon \u010civa assumed the form of a horse, made the reservoir dry, while Vi\u1e63\u1e47u became a m\u0101la, the bridle and whip. The sun and moon were the wheels of the chariot to which the horse was harnessed, in which \u010civa rode, and destroyed the demons. According to this legend, \u010civa was the clever and cleverly mentioned in the song.\n\n\u221ak\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101 means literally, \u2018to be very eager after anything\u2019; hence, \u2018to run eagerly after anything.\u2019 Thus, \u221ak\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101 \u2018he is very eager.\u2019 Similarly, it is used as a synonym of \u221ak\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101 \u2018to put.\u2019\n\n\u221ab\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101 is common in vulgar speech, and \u221ab\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101 here means \u2018to put.\u2019\n\n\u221ab\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101, \u221ab\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101, or \u221ab\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101 are said to be corruptions of \u221ab\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101. 46, note 2. \u221ab\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101, \u221ab\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101, or \u221ab\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101 (etc.), commonly mean like \u221ab\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101 or \u221ab\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101 \u2018kindly,\u2019 or \u2018be good enough to use.

XIII.\u2014Observations on the various Texts and Translations of the so-called \"Song of Meysin\"; an Inquiry into Meysin's claim to its Authorship; and an Appendix on Arabic Transliteration and Pronunciation.\u00b9 By J. W. Redhouse, M.R.A.S., Litt.D., C.M.G., etc., etc.\n\nDr. Carlyle's book, \"Specimens of Arabic Poetry,\" may be somewhat scarce, and Captain, now Sir R., Burton's \"Pilgrimage to El-Medinah and Meccah\" gives only an English version, without the Arabic text, of the little piece of poetry attributed to Meysin, the mother of the second Damascus Caliph of the house of 'Umeyya, Yezid son of Mu'awiya son of 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n \u1e62akhr son of \u1e24arb, etc.\n\nMr. Freeland has, therefore, rendered a real service to the many lovers of old Arabian literature by printing in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, New Series, Vol. XVIII. p. 90, a complete and fully-vowelled text of the ditty, as this allows them to compare it with the very free rhymed and metrical versions made by himself, by Sir R. Burton, and by Dr. Carlyle. Their talented, but somewhat florid productions disguise altogether the real form and the simplicity of the little poem. I have imagined, therefore, that a closer verbal prose translation of its distichs would not be a disservice to the cause of Arabic studies in England.\n\nA valued and talented friend, one of the Members of our Society, Mr. E. J. W. Gibb, has kindly put my prose trans-\n\n\u00b9 As this paper may be considered illustrative of its author's method of Arabic transliteration, the native names are left precisely as spelt in the MS.; not modified to be in accordance with the orthography usually adopted in the Journal. The author, however, prefers a straight stroke under the letters \u1e25 : \u1e93 instead of the dot (\u1e25 \u1e63) as used throughout this article; see his reasons on p. 108.\u2014Ed.\nmetrical form, with the same kind of monotone used in the Arabic original,\u2014a system of which he expresses a great attachment, and had much experience.\n\nThe readers of our Journal to compare these five one another, I here copy those of Dr. Carlyle's rendering, while Mr. Freeland's rendering, with his Arabic text, can be studied at p. 90-91 of volume.\n\nsays (according to Mr. Clouston's \"Arabic English Readers\"):\n\n\"The Song of Maisuna.\"\n\nThe russet suit of camel's hair,\nWith spritely light and eye serene,\nDearer to my bosom far,\nThan all the trappings of a queen.\n\nThe humble tent, and murmuring breeze,\nThat whistles through its fluttering walls,\nMy unassuming fancy please,\nBetter than towers and splendid halls.\n\nThe attendant colts, that bounding fly,\nAnd frolic by the litter's side,\nBe dearer in Maisuna's eye,\nThan gorgeous mules in all their pride.\n\nThe watch-dog's voice, that bays whene'er\nA stranger seeks his master's cot,\nSounds sweeter in Maisuna's ear,\nThan yonder trumpet's long-drawn note.\n\nThe rustic youth, unspoiled by art,\nSon of my kindred, poor but free,\nStill ever to Maisuna's heart,\nBe dearer, pampered fool, than thee.\"\n\nDr. Carlyle's \"Pilgrimage,\" vol. iii. p. 262, has:\n\nTake these purple robes away,\nGive back my cloak of camel's hair,\nI bear me from this tow'ring pile\nTo where the Black Tents flap i' the air.\nThe camel's colt with falt'ring tread,\nThe dog that bays at all but me,\nDelight me more than ambling mules\u2014\nThan every art of minstrelsy.\nAnd any cousin, poor but free,\nMight take me, fatted ass! from thee.\"\n\nFrom a comparison of these two versions, it is evident that Dr. Carlyle and Sir R. Burton have used the same Arabic recension, in five disticha, for their renderings, however widely these two differ in form and in words. Sir R. Burton's is less diffuse than that of Dr. Carlyle. The latter uses the expression 'pampered fool' where Sir R. Burton has 'fatted ass.' I had imagined, with only Mr. Freeland's Arabic text to judge from, that these two offensive variants were perhaps either poetic licences, or that the text or texts they had used had the word \u0639\u062c\u0644 'a calf,' in the last hemistich, where Mr. Freeland gives the anagram \u0639\u0644. In that case, \u0639\u062c\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0644\u0641 would have meant, correctly rendered, 'foddered calf,' easily turned by poetic licence into both 'pampered fool' and 'fatted ass.'\n\nMy friend Mr. Gibb has, however, latterly favoured me with a copy of Dr. Carlyle's Arabic original, from the second edition of his \"Specimens,\" London, 1810; and this has the same word, \u0639\u0644, given by Mr. Freeland. Neither of their translations has, unfortunately, a trace of either of the two real meanings of the term \u0639\u0644, viz. 1st, 'an ass, wild or domestic, strong and fat;' 2nd, 'a man, foreign and non-Muslim' (i.e. an outlandish barbarian). But, as its accompanying adjective, \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0644\u0641, means, 'home-fed, foddered, not pastured or pasturing,' the two words combined can only indicate 'a fodder-fed domestic ass,' the alternative signification, 'an outlandish barbarian,' being, consequently, out of the question.

Henry published some part of an Arabic work, but translated and annotated by a lady, in which the song of Meys\u00fcn is given, like that of Mr. Freeland; evidently the but arranged in a different order. Her thus:\n\nthat the winds make tremble\nrather to me than a noble palace;\ndish of crumbs on the floor of my home\nrather to me than a varied feast;\nhe soughing of the breeze through every crevice\nrather to me than the beating of drums;\ncamel's wool ab\u00e2h which gladdens my eye\nrather to me than filmy robes;\ndog barking around my path\nrather to me than a coaxing cat;\nrestive young camel, following the litter,\nrather to me than a pacing mule;\nfeeble boor from midst my cousinhood,\nrather to me than a rampant ass.\nThe numbers in parentheses show Mr. Freeland's order of the distichs, for the sake of comparison. The words of each distich are mainly, essentially, the same in the two versions. Mrs. Clerk's translation is much closer to the Arabic text than either Dr. Carlyle's, or Sir R. Burton's, as a whole; though several words are incorrectly rendered, and many of the ideas incorporated in the lady's imagery are taken from Western life, not redolent of the Desert.\n\nMrs. Clerk's notice of Meys\u00fcn is to the following effect: \"M\u00eds\u00fcn, the daughter of Bahdal, was married to Mu\u00e1wiyah, and he brought her from amongst the wandering Arabs into Damascus. But she sorrowed exceedingly for her people at the remembrance of her home; and one day, whilst he was listening to her, he heard her reciting and saying\" the verses given above. \"Upon hearing these lines, Mu\u00e1wiyah exclaimed, 'The daughter of Bahdal was not satisfied until she had likened me to a rampant ass!' And he ordered her to be packed off again to her family in the desert.\"\n\nIn a note, Mrs. Clerk says further: \"She had an excellent genius for poetry; and at Mu\u00e1wiyah's command, took her son Yezid (Mu\u00e1wiyah's successor) with her into the desert among her own relations, in order to inspire him with poetic sentiments.\"\n\nA foot-note in Sir R. Burton's \"Pilgrimage\" informs us as follows: \"The British reader will be shocked to hear that by the term 'fatted ass,' the intellectual lady alluded to her husband. The story is, that Muawiyah, overhearing the song, sent back the singer to her cousins and beloved wilds. Maysunah departed, with her son Yezid, and did not return to Damascus till the 'fatted ass' had joined his forefathers.\"\n\nDr. Carlyle (in Mr. Clouston's book) gives the same story, but in more reserved terms, ending thus: \"As a punishment for her fault, he ordered her to retire from court. Maisuna immediately obeyed, and, taking her infant son Yezid with her, returned to Yemen; nor did she revisit Damascus till after the death of Mowiah, when Yezid ascended the throne.\"\nwrites \"Mis\u016bn\" instead of Meys\u016bn. But, le's \u0645\u064a\u0633\u0648\u0646 though he transliterates 'Maisuna,' Mr. Freeland's \u0645\u064a\u0633\u0648\u0646 transliterated by him is true name, as is confirmed in the Q\u0101m\u016bs the root \u0645\u064a\u0633\u0646 where it is said: \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064a\u0633\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u0645 \u064a\u064f\u0628\u064e\u062f\u0650\u0651\u0644\u064f \"and Meys\u016bn is the name of the hdel, the mother of Yezid son of Mu'awiya.\" n's 'Maysunah' is, therefore, quadruply first vowel being, correctly, the soft e, not while the second vowel is long, \u016b; and the able interpolation.\n\nw to Mr. Freeland's text, p. 90, any one may if entirely uninstructed in Arabic, that it right-hand side of the left-hand column of he looks at the page, a perpendicular row seven times repeated, once in These words simply mean: (were) lovelier... This one reiterated expression, then, d clause, the second hemistich, of each verse out the alteration of a single letter or vowel-libly stamps the type of the whole poem in a te, remarkable manner.\n\nreader next examine the versions of Dr. Burton, and Mr. Freeland, comparing them k's rendering. He will perceive that they systematically shunned this sevenfold, charac- f words; they have striven to give a variety s uniformity,\u2014they have attempted \"to gild paint the lily,\" and they have merely over- tern simplicity with a series of Western em-\n\nit metrical prose translation offered below for tion gives as close an approximation to the final as I have been able to compass, in about ter of syllables; and my friend Mr. Gibb's hich follows it, without losing sight of the ll be found, I trust, by our readers, to exhale,\nlike the sweet wood-violet, an aroma as delicately poetic as the very simple ideas, clothed in the artless words of the poem, can well be made to furnish.\n\n**Meysun's Ditty.**\n\nTo dress in camlet smock, with tearless, cheerful eye,\n   Were lovelier to me than gauzy webs to wear.\nA tent through which the winds should waft their fluttering breeze,\n   Were lovelier to me than sumptuous princely bower.\nA wayward camel-colt, behind the litter-train,\n   Were lovelier to me than nimbly-pacing mule.\nA dog that bayed the coming guests not yet at hand,\n   Were lovelier to me than fondly-coaxing cat.\nTo eat a crumblet in a tent's retiring nook\n   Were lovelier to me than eating breadcake bun.\nThe hoarse, loud roarings of the winds in every glen,\n   Were lovelier to me than timbrels' clattering pulse.\nA generous, slender youth, one of my uncle's sons,\n   Were lovelier to me than any foddered ass.\n\nMr. Gibb's versified rendering is as follows:\n\n**Meysun's Ditty.**\n\nTo dress in camlet smock with cool and placid cyne,\n   Were liefer far to me than robes of gauze to wear;\nA tent, wherethrough the winds in gentle wafts should breathe,\n   Were liefer far to me than palace haught and fair;\nA wayward camel-colt behind the litter-train,\n   Were liefer far to me than hinny debonair;\nA dog that bayed the guests ere yet they came me nigh,\n   Were liefer far to me than cat with fondling air;\nTo eat a scantling meal aside within the tent,\n   Were liefer far to me than feast on dainties rare;\nThe soughing moan of winds that blow through every glen,\n   Were liefer far to me than sounding tabors' blare;\nA slim but generous youth from 'mong my uncle's sons,\n   Were liefer far to me than foddered ass, I swear.\nnow in a position to choose for himself which versions given of this little Arabian song, he may think best adapted to convey its real variants in Dr. Carlyle's text, as compared Mr. Freeland, of \u0639\u0628\u0627 for \u0639\u0628\u0627\u062f\u0647\u060c of \u062a\u062e\u062a\u0642 for for \u0632\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0641\u060c are not of much consequence, the ng probably a printer's error. His \u0647\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0646\u0648\u0641\u060c states that the sixth line of Mr. Freeland's altogether unknown to some copyist through yle's text was derived, as that distich ends with which the \u062a\u0645\u0631 is a synonym with Dr. Carlyle's st, again, is apparently a clerical substitute for two distichs having been thus erroneously\n\nThe substitution of \u0646\u064e\u0642\u0650\u064a\u0631 for \u0646\u064e\u062d\u0650\u064a\u0641 accounts 'poor,' where Mr. Freeland's rendering of 'slim,' 'thin,' 'slender,' or the r.

It \u00e2h' that is to gladden the eye; but it is 'a together with a cool, i.e. an unreddened, earless, cheerful eye,' or, in other words, \"a appiness of mind were lovelier, dearer to me No. 2, again, it should not be that 'the winds ' the tent; but that the winds flutter as they the tent. In No. 3, 'litter' should be litters, several or many litters. In No. 4, \"around a thoroughly Western misconception of what in front of me, i.e. between them and me, ' In No. 5, \"varied feast\" is too far from the th words; the comparison is between a dry, horsel, \"a crumblet,\" and a fresh-baked, soft\ncake of bread, usually eaten in Syria, etc., with other food at meals. In No. 6, \"crevice\" is not right; and in No. 7, the \u062e\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0642\u0652 of the text is the very reverse of \"a boor,\" and really means a fine, noble fellow; while \"rampant\" is wrong altogether, unless we are to read, as is given further on, in Ziy\u0101 Pasha's recension, \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0650\u064a\u0641\u064c for \u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0641\u064c after \u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u062c.\n\nThe text given by Ziy\u0101 Pasha (then Ziy\u0101 Bey) in a three-volume collection of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish poems, to which he gave the name of \u062d\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0641\u064c, is found in vol. ii. p. 442, of the collection. It does not agree in the sequence of the distichs with either of those of Mr. Freeland or Mrs. Clerk, except as to the last, and only important one. This occupies the same place in all three, as also in the versions of Dr. Carlyle and Sir R. Burton. Several variant words occur, too, in the distichs. No vowels are given.

The variation of the rhyming long vowels, by the use of four letters, \u0648, \u0648, and three letters, \u0648, \u0648, is at best a permissible licence in Arabic verse, is not tolerated in Persian or Turkish, and cannot be taken as adding beauty to the poem. The sevenfold repetition may be taken, perhaps, as a very effectual mark of individuality in the composition, which thus stands unparalleled, very likely, and can therefore be held to constitute a kind of beauty not advisable to imitate. We may, therefore, look upon \"Meys\u00fcn's Poem\" as a somewhat faulty, though striking, artless ballad, well adapted to captivate the rude, uncultivated children of the desert and villagers, so as to elicit their applause on being recited. We shall then have said as much in its praise as its subject admits of; and this preference for desert-life shown in its words may, it seems, have given to our own poet, Moore, the germ of the idea from which he evolved his charming little gem of \"Fly to the desert, fly with me!\" which is as untrue, in reality, as it is specious and captivating to young, ardent minds, unacquainted with the hard lot of incessant toil, frequent starvation, and ceaseless blood-feuds, of which the life of the desert is chiefly made up.\n\nBut a much more serious question arises with reference to the supposed authorship of this little Arabic ditty; more especially since it is known that Ziy\u0101 Pasha, himself a poet of high standing and research, avows himself ignorant of its composer. In a marginal note he has laconically marked the poem as being \"by an author unknown.\" One would imagine that he must certainly have known that common rumour has for ages attributed it to Meys\u00fcn; and he may, therefore, in his judgment, have deliberately and definitively rejected this parentage. Before I had heard of his marginal note, I had myself felt inclined to doubt, urged by considerations of the status and known or probable precedents, respectively, of the dramatis personae of the little burletta. Did, then, Meys\u00fcn\nose or even sing these verses? Did Mu'awiya, r sing them on a chance occasion, dismiss her m his home\u2014from his mansion of governor, for overeign until many years later? His son and d, from his recorded age of 34 at his accession, a born not many years after Mu'awiya became Damascus for the second caliph 'Umer; and r the two foregoing questions with any degree we must trace the history, not of Mu'awiya e rise and early progress of Isl\u0101m, as follows: father, 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n Sakhr son of \u1e24arb son whence the name of the 'Umeyyid dynasty), 57 (A.D. 565), being Mu\u1e25ammed's senior by s. He was a rich, travelling merchant, became ain of the Qureysh tribe (from a branch of himids, Mu\u1e25ammed also sprang), and a kind ayor, Sheykh of Mekka. He bravely, sternly mmed in the field for some years, but failed, success. When Mu\u1e25ammed, in the eighth nigration (Hijra) from Mekka to Med\u012bna, and f his age, advanced at length with a resistless ived the submission of his native place, he was distance from the holy city, first by his own 'Abb\u0101s, slightly his superior in age (who had endly to him, and whose descendants eventually ob\u0101sid caliphs), and then by his hitherto deter- 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n, aged sixty-five (and whom 'Umer ed, had not Mu\u1e25ammed restrained him). These ne made their profession of Isl\u0101m, were accepted d, and followed him into Mekka. There and vife of 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n, with her two sons, Yezid e) and Mu'awiya (aged thirty), also avow their am. Mu'awiya even professed to have secretly hith two years earlier, when Mu\u1e25ammed made ndeybiyya with the Mekkans. 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n's\ndaughter, Mu\u02bfawiya\u2019s sister, \u2019Ummu-Hab\u012bba Remla, had already been married in that sixth year of the Hijra (A.D. 628), as a widow, to Mu\u1e25ammed, having, with her first husband, early adopted \u2019Isl\u0101m, and with him joined the former emigration to Abyssinia. There he died, and there she was betrothed by proxy to Mu\u1e25ammed, joining him later at Med\u012bna. Mu\u02bfawiya was therefore Mu\u1e25ammed\u2019s brother-in-law.\n\n\u2019Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n, with his two sons, Yez\u012bd and Mu\u02bfawiya, as well as \u2019Abb\u0101s, fought for \u2019Isl\u0101m under Mu\u1e25ammed in the battle of Huneyn after the conquest of Mekka, in the same year, A.H. 8 (A.D. 630). They each received from Mu\u1e25ammed, as a share of the spoil captured through the victory, one hundred camels and forty ounces of silver. \u2019Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n was present, later in the same year, at the siege and capture of Ta\u02bfif, where he lost an eye by a wound.\n\nMu\u02bfawiya, the younger of the two sons of \u2019Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n, was henceforward employed by Mu\u1e25ammed as one of his secretaries, scribes, or amanuenses; being one of twenty-three whose names are recorded as having served in that capacity, some more, some less. Zeyd son of Th\u0101bit was the most usual scribe, and Mu\u02bfawiya stands next; having served so more than any of the remaining one-and-twenty, although the whole of the first four caliphs, \u2019Eb\u016b-Bekr, \u2019Umer, \u2019Uthm\u0101n, and \u2019Aliyy, are included among them by history.\n\nMu\u1e25ammed died in A.H. 11 (A.D. 632) at Med\u012bna, and was succeeded by \u2019Eb\u016b-Bekr, \u201cthe Most Faithful,\u201d as guide and ruler of young and orphaned \u2019Isl\u0101m; spontaneously elected by his peers, the acknowledged leaders of the infant community. He took the title of Khalifa (substitute; whence our \u201ccaliph\u201d). He had first to recall to their faith and allegiance many of the tribes of Arabia. Then, in A.H. 12 (A.D. 633), he sent an army to oppose the Romans in southern trans-Jordanic Syria. He gave the chief command to Yez\u012bd, Mu\u02bfawiya\u2019s elder brother, son of \u2019Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n. Yez\u012bd re-\nthe Roman levies opposed to him, and sent Medina, the \"City of the Prophet,\" where he was buried; his grave, with those of his three successors, being piously visited to this day. He accompanied his brother Yezid in this expedition, and joined him as long as they both lived. They returned to Arabia from Syria.\n\nThese successes paved the way to the further despatch of levies from Medina; and these were put under the command of 'A\u1e63i (written also '\u0100\u1e63i). In his younger days he had persecuted Mu\u1e25ammed with insulting jeers and insults. He now showed himself a zealous and capable general, and, later on, a no less skilful leader.\n\nAs more numerous levies were gradually forwarded and coming from all Arabia, 'Amr was directed to Palestine, while Yezid advanced on the road to Damascus, and other captains were sent to different places. The chief command was entrusted to 'Eb\u016b-'Ubayda, who, though eminently prudent, he lacked all celerity, and ability. Success now seemed to be at an end; conquest came to a standstill. 'Eb\u016b-'Ubayda was recalled from Babylonia, where he had begun to feel the redoubtable Khalid, son of Welid, \"Sword of God,\" to infuse new vigour into the army. In a short time Bu\u1e63r\u0101 (Bostra) fell to his host, Damascus was besieged.\n\nThe emperor Heraclius, then holding his court at Antioch, sent a large force to relieve Damascus. But the siege suspended to go and meet these reliefs. Twice the Roman succours defeated in the field, twice the third time at 'Ejnadeyn (Aiznadin), near Damascus. After this, Damascus did not long hold out against the Muslim hosts. But on the very day of its fall, the Caliph 'Eb\u016b-Bekr breathed his last at Medina,\nwhen sixty-three years of age, in A.H. 13 (A.D. 634). He was succeeded by 'Umer, son of Khatt\u0101b, now fifty-three years old. This caliph reappointed 'Eb\u016b-'Ubeyda to the chief command, and Baalbek was taken in A.H. 15 (A.D. 636). Emessa (\u1e24ims) was next occupied, after Resten and Sheyzer had surrendered.\n\n'Eb\u016b-'Ubeyda now went southwards to meet a fourth Roman army under the emperor's son Constantine, who was at C\u00e6sarea (C\u00e6sarea Philippi, Bany\u0101s?) with fifty thousand men. They were met, however, by a still larger force of eighty thousand, under a general named Manuel, who had been further reinforced by sixty thousand Christian Arabians from the trans-Jordan regions, under Jebela, son of 'Eyhem, the last king of the line of Gass\u0101n, who later embraced 'Isl\u0101m, but again apostatized. The two opposing forces met on the banks of the Yermuk river, the Hieromax of classical authors. A battle ensued and lasted several days, the Romans being at length utterly defeated, and Manuel killed in A.H. 15 (Nov. A.D. 636). The victors returned to Damascus.\n\nThe caliph 'Umer now ordered the siege of Jerusalem. Yez\u012bd son of 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n led the van from Damascus, and 'Eb\u016b-'Ubeyda followed with the main force. After four months' siege, Jerusalem offered to capitulate on condition that the caliph should come from Medina to take possession. He did so, and the surrender took place in A.H. 17 (A.D. 638).\n\nAleppo and Antioch next fell to the Muslim arms that same year, and from this latter city the Roman emperor Heraclius fled to Constantinople.\n\nOn the other hand, the caliph 'Umer, after the capture of Jerusalem, ordered 'Amr son of '\u0100\u1e63i to proceed to the conquest of Egypt. He first laid siege to C\u00e6sarea, and sent Yez\u012bd son of 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n to attack Tyre, which was given up to him by treachery, as Tripoli of Syria had been delivered to the Muslims before. Constantine now left his\nated to C\u00e6sarea Pal\u00e6stine on the sea-coast; tely fled thence by sea, and this town was 'Amr son of '\u0100\u1e63i. Other places fell in suc- conquest of Syria was completed in the fifth iph, and latter part of A.H. 17 (A.D. 639). A broke out at Emmaus, and spread all over hich both 'Eb\u016b-'Ubeyda and Yez\u012bd son of ed in A.H. 18 (A.D. 640), the latter leaving no pointing his younger brother Mu'awiya to his command over Damascus and Syria. He popular name of Yez\u012bd the Good.\n\nA.H. 20 (A.D. 641) the caliph 'Umer made of 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n governor of Syria, as he had ns until then of his deceased brother. He was r-two years of age, and continued governor for during the caliphates of 'Umer, 'Uthm\u0101n, and 'Aliyy at first, and next he and 'Aliyy's an, were rival caliphs during the last five or at period; but 'Aliyy being murdered at Ku\u1e63a n A.H. 35 (A.D. 655), and \u1e24asan resigning \u0101wiya was at length universally acknowledged ph of 'Isl\u0101m in A.H. 41 (A.D. 661), being then s old.\n\na son of 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n died in A.H. 60 (A.D. son and successor Yez\u012bd was thirty-four years ter was, consequently, born in A.H. 26 (A.D. here is no mention made of his having had any , his father most probably took Yez\u012bd's mother e in A.H. 25 (A.D. 645), the year after he was is government by the third caliph 'Uthm\u0101n. likely, at that time from twelve to fourteen d Mu'awiya was forty-seven.\n\nasked permission of the caliph 'Umer to fit coast; but 'Umer was averse from the project. murdered in A.H. 24 (A.D. 644), and 'Uthm\u0101n\nsucceeded him, 'Uthm\u0101n gave the required sanction. In A.H. 26 (A.D. 646), then, the very year of his son Yezid's birth, he sent his first ships to sea, and the firstfruits of the expedition was the capture of Aradus and Cyprus. The defeat of a Roman fleet was the next exploit. Then Crete and Malta were visited, and Rhodes captured. Old Phenician days had returned. Another Roman fleet was beaten on the coast of Asia Minor; every port in those parts was thrown into a state of alarm, and the harbour of Constantinople itself was the scene of naval hostilities. Such was Mu'awiya at and about the time of Yezid's birth.\n\nThe caliph 'Uthm\u0101n now dismissed the conqueror and governor of Egypt, the talented 'Amr, son of '\u0100\u1e63i. He appointed in 'Amr's stead his own foster-brother, 'Abdu-'ll\u0101h son of Sa'd. Troubles broke out in Medina itself, ending in the assassination of the caliph in A.H. 35 (A.D. 655), and the proclamation of 'Aliyy, son of 'Eb\u016b-\u1e6calib, Mu\u1e25ammed's cousin-german and son-in-law. He had married the youngest of the prophet's daughters, F\u0101\u1e6dima, and by her was the father of \u1e24asan and \u1e24useyn, who were about seven and six years of age, respectively, when Mu\u1e25ammed and also their mother died in one year. From these five, Mu\u1e25ammed, F\u0101\u1e6dima, 'Aliyy, \u1e24asan, and \u1e24useyn, are descended, through fathers or mothers, all the Seyyids and Sherifs of 'Isl\u0101m. The five are known as \"the holy mantle family, 'ehlu 'l kis\u0101'.\"\n\nBut Mu'awiya accused 'Aliyy of being privy to, if not of covertly instigating, the murder of 'Uthm\u0101n. He proclaimed himself the avenger of the slaughtered ruler, and his party saluted him as caliph. He called to his councils the talented 'Amr son of '\u0100\u1e63i, promising to reinstate him in Egypt. Armies were levied on each side, and in A.H. 37 (A.D. 657) the two conflicting Muslim hosts, 'Aliyy's from Babylonia, and Mu'awiya's from Syria, came in sight at Siffin, on the bank of the Euphrates, and fought several severe battles with balanced success. Negotiations were set on foot; and it was\nfor the peace of 'Isl\u0101m and avoidance of further rivals should defer the question of the caliphate d should meanwhile retire, each to his own \u1e25iwiya named as his umpire the astute and son of '\u0100\u1e63i, and 'Aliyy another. These met, ay, at D\u016bmetu-'l-Jendel (the biblical Dumah, vf, Palgrave's 'Djowf'), on the south border of ert. By a stratagem, 'Aliyy was deposed by e, and 'Amr son of '\u0100\u1e63i proclaimed Mu'awiya nd rightful caliph.\n\nrivals, notwithstanding, kept possession of what in A.H. 40 (A.D. 660), 'Aliyy was murdered in l. His eldest son \u1e24asan, then 36 years old, his place by his party. Difficulties arising, n made terms with Mu'awiya, abdicated, and na with his younger brother \u1e24useyn.\n\nus became at length, in A.H. 41 (A.D. 661), the iph of 'Isl\u0101m. His father 'Ebu-Sufy\u0101n had earlier, in A.H. 31, at the age of eighty-six. was now fifteen years old. His dynasty, the yya, the 'Umeyyids, vulgarly denominated by Ommiads, ruled for ninety-one years, until 749), when they were exterminated by the 'Abb\u0101s, the 'Abb\u0101sid. They conquered all avaded Spain, and pushed on, in the east, to a.\n\nirrounded himself with men of talent; and ices Roman or Greek science began to be he Arabian Muslims, in addition to their own and the various nascent branches of Muslim sophy, tradition, law, etc. This is not to be hen we reflect what numbers of Roman citizens braced 'Isl\u0101m, many of them persons of rank, arning. Faithful to his promise, Mu'awiya ediately the able 'Amr son of '\u0100\u1e63i in his\ngovernment of Egypt, where he died and was buried in A.H. 43 (A.D. 663).\n\nMu\u02bfawiya now, A.H. 44 (A.D. 664), made an effort to obtain possession of the capital of the eastern empire of Rome, the city of Constantine the Great. His general was the veteran Sufy\u0101n son of \u02bfAbdu-ll\u0101h, who had under his command Mu\u02bfawiya\u2019s only son Yez\u012bd, aged 18, the younger son of the murdered caliph \u02bfAliyy, \u1e24useyn, aged 46, and the venerable \u02bfEbu-\u02bfEyy\u016bb Kh\u0101lid son of Zeyd, who, forty-four years before, at Medina, had been the host of Mu\u1e25ammed for a month, on his first arrival as a fugitive from Mekka; besides other warriors of renown or promise. Six years were unavailingly consumed in this distant enterprise. \u02bfEbu-\u02bfEyy\u016bb was one of its victims. His death occurred about the year A.H. 50 (A.D. 670); and a mausoleum was built over his grave in later days, having by its side the cathedral mosque where the Ottoman Sultan-Caliphs now assume the sabre at their ceremonial accession.\n\nMu\u02bfawiya\u2019s only son Yez\u012bd, born, as before mentioned, in A.H. 26 (A.D. 646), had married, when only sixteen years of age, in A.H. 42 (A.D. 662), and had become a father the year following, A.H. 43 (A.D. 663), before he went to seek renown at the siege of Constantinople. After his return from thence, when \u1e24asan, the eldest son of the former caliph \u02bfAliyy, was poisoned at Medina, as was said, in A.H. 49 (A.D. 680), Yez\u012bd, then twenty-three years old, was accused or suspected, perhaps by sectarian or family enemies of his line, of having instigated \u1e24asan\u2019s murder by one of the wives of the victim, so as to clear the way to his own succession. But the murdered man left a brother; and they both had several sons. Moreover, Yez\u012bd did not succeed his father until eleven years later, A.H. 60 (A.D. 679), as Mu\u02bfawiya lived to be eighty years old, or more. Yez\u012bd was then thirty-four, reigned but five years, in A.H. 65 (A.D. 684), and had for his successor his only Mu\u02bfawiya II., aged twenty-two. He abdicated after a\nix months, and died soon afterwards, the direct\nat Mu'awiya thus becoming extinct, and the\nssing to collaterals.\n\nursory survey we see that history is silent\nld son of Mu'awiya and his mother Meys\u00fcn\nof his birth until his father sent him to the\nntinople when he was eighteen years old, and\nra was an undisputed and mighty monarch.\n\nefore, be directly disproved that Meys\u00fcn was\ning her song, or that she took her son away\n\nmay be remarked that the words said to have\nto her on the occasion by Mu'awiya, \"Rejoin\ne,\" do not constitute a full divorce a vinculo\nIsl\u0101m, but are recallable.\n\nse that she was dismissed to her own kin\ns about a year old, he may have been recalled\nas soon as was deemed necessary for his\nis was, apparently, completed when he was\nry at the age of sixteen, and was sent to the\nntinople when eighteen. If he remained with\nhe was eight or ten, he may have imbibed\nrom her kindred, sufficient to be improved by\neachers provided by his father, a man of mark\nning of the period. His training by such\nhat time till he was sixteen, and even eighteen,\nle must by then have acquired enough of the\nity of diction and poetic eloquence to warrant\nhe has left of being an accomplished orator\nextemporiser of verse. The Arabian tribesmen,\nmed's advent, as they are still, were, many of\nribes and first-rate oral poets, whose verses\nde over the whole peninsula, to be repeated at\ngs even to our day. Almost all the early\nim were famed as poets also.\n\nthe possibilities, what, on the other hand,\nthe probabilities that common sense may educe out of the meagre details that must serve as the premisses to any conclusion as to Meys\u00fcn and the poem attributed to her?\n\nWe learn, in short, from the historical fragments given above, that 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n, and also his two sons, Yez\u012bd the Good and Mu'awiya, were men of talent and learning. Verses by the father have come down to us; Yez\u012bd was a successful leader; and Mu'awiya excelled in all the qualities that go to make up a great ruler. They all three went to Syria after Muhammed's death, aided in the conquest of that country, and died there. Mu'awiya, more especially, after he became governor of that province, made himself so beloved or feared that he ultimately became the greatest potentate of his time, as he was also a most generous patron of talent and learning.\n\nWas he, then, the man, the prince, in the early years of his delegated governorship, when he must have been most prudent and circumspect, most careful of all his words and actions, when Meys\u00fcn was newly united to him, and his only son Yez\u012bd was an infant, when all his powers of body and mind were at their prime, or in their early maturity; was he a man likely to take to himself, in the first place, as his wife, a raw, untutored child of the desert, and was the young lady he selected as his partner likely to have preserved in her mind so lively a preference for the desert life as to long for it in the midst of the splendour with which he doubtlessly surrounded her? Even had she been so, she was a mother as well as a wife and a great princess. Would she, then, be likely to look upon the grand, wise, brave, learned, generous, and generally beloved father of her infant son as a \"foddered ass,\" or, taking Ziy\u0101 Pasha's version, as a \"coarse barbarian,\" \"outlandish miscreant,\" or \"tiresome lout\"? Spoiled, haughty, even enervated, he may have possibly grown in far later years; but at the time of his life in question he must have been in the constant habitual practice\nof all the noblest and most considerate punctilios natural to a rising prosperous statesman, trusted by his distant sovereign, loved by and relied on by those around and under him, respected or feared by his neighbours. \"Ass,\" \"barbarian,\" \"boor,\" \"clown,\" \"lout\" he certainly could not have been, save in the eyes of a sectarian or personal jealous enemy, and reckless vituperation.\n\nIs there not then, even on these considerations alone, a certain weight, a preponderating importance, to be attached to Ziya Pasha's marginal remark that the author of the verses attributed to Meysun is unknown? He most likely was well aware that they commonly pass as the production of the fretting petulancy of Yezid's talented but untamed mother, Mu'awiya's Bedewiyy wife. But, weighing the crucial expression of the poem, \"foddered ass\" or \"coarse barbarian,\" as has been done here, Ziya Pasha may well have concluded in his own mind that the case was \"not proven,\" as far as Meysun and Mu'awiya are concerned; and thereupon curtly recorded his conviction that the verses, though worth insertion in a miscellany, are the production of some unknown author. The words of the poem would far better suit the case of some recently captured and enslaved desert girl, held as his mistress by some \"coarse,\" unfeeling, well-to-do citizen or petty governor.\n\nA far more improbable detail in the story about the dismissal of Meysun by Mu'awiya when he chanced to overhear her singing her ditty, beyond the likelihood, even, that he should apply the offensive expression to himself, is that, on going away from him to join her own kin, she should be allowed by him to take his infant son Yezid, the sole hope of his line, with her, according to Sir R. Burton, \"to her cousins and beloved wilds,\" as Mrs. Clerk says, \"into the desert,\" but, as Dr. Carlyle more definitely puts it, \"to Yemen.\"\n\nNow Yezid appears, as has already been stated, to have\nbeen Mu\u2018\u0101wiya\u2019s first and only child. He may possibly have had other offspring before his union with Meys\u00fcn, and he may have begotten other children from other wives or concubines after her departure, if he really did dismiss her. But history makes no mention whatever of any such; and the first authentic notice of Yezid in active life, after his birth, that I know of, is the account of his being sent with the fleet and army that fruitlessly besieged Constantinople, after Mu\u2018\u0101wiya had become sole caliph, and when Yezid was already eighteen years old; for his marriage at the age of sixteen is a mere computation backwards from the age of his son and successor, Mu\u2018\u0101wiya II., at the date of his accession.\n\nLet us now contemplate the complexion of the times at and after Yezid\u2019s birth, in A.H. 26, until his father had become sole caliph, in A.H. 41, and his own marriage the year following, A.H. 42, at the age of sixteen, when he must have been at Damascus with his father.\n\nAt the very time of Yezid\u2019s birth, Mu\u2018\u0101wiya was fitting out his first ships and personally conducting his maritime expeditions against Cyprus, the islands of Aradus, Rhodes, Malta, etc.; and it was nine years before the murder of \u2018Uthm\u0101n, in A.H. 35, called Mu\u2018\u0101wiya to declare against \u2018Aliyy, and to become his competitor for the caliphate. If Yezid ever was allowed to leave Damascus with his mother, it must have been during a portion or the whole of the last seven or eight of those nine years.\n\nBut all the reported facts of Mu\u2018\u0101wiya\u2019s life, including his maritime expeditions, besides the character that history has recorded of him for moderation, generosity, perseverance, and astuteness, seem to make it in the highest degree improbable that he should have sent away for so frivolous a cause the mother of his only son; much less that he should have allowed her to take that only son of his into the desert, and least of all to distant Yemen, fifteen hundred miles from Damascus.\nest and most considerate punctilios natural to a\nous statesman, trusted by his distant sovereign,\nrelied on by those around and under him,\nared by his neighbours. \"Ass,\" \"barbarian,\"\nn,\" \"lout\" he certainly could not have been,\nes of a sectarian or personal jealous enemy,\nuperation.\n\nthen, even on these considerations alone, a\na preponderating importance, to be attached\n's marginal remark that the author of the\ned to Meys\u00fcn is unknown?

But, weighing the\ntion of the poem, \"foddered ass\" or \"coarse\"\nhas been done here, Ziy\u0101 Pasha may well have\nis own mind that the case was \"not proven,\"\nn and Mu\u02bfawiya are concerned; and thereupon\nhis conviction that the verses, though worth\nmiscellany, are the production of some unknown\nwords of the poem would far better suit the\ncently captured and enslaved desert girl, held\ns by some \"coarse,\" unfeeling, well-to-do\ngovernor.\n\nimprobable detail in the story about the\nMeys\u00fcn by Mu\u02bfawiya when he chanced to\nnging her ditty, beyond the likelihood, even,\napply the offensive expression to himself, is\naway from him to join her own kin, she\nved by him to take his infant son Yezid, the\nline, with her, according to Sir R. Burton,\nis and beloved wilds,\" as Mrs. Clerk says,\nt,\" but, as Dr. Carlyle more definitely puts it,\n\nappears, as has already been stated, to have\nEuropean enterprise passing to India and China, Persia, etc., round the Cape of Good Hope, the commercial centre of Arabia, the emporium where the rich products of the East, together with its own native drugs and manufactures, were bartered for such articles as the Roman world, Syria, Egypt, and Africa could bring to its marts. When 'Isl\u0101m roused the whole of the Arabian tribes, urban and rustic, to the conquest of half the known world, warriors from Yemen, Yem\u0101ma, and \u2018Um\u0101n, flocked to the standards, as well as the men of the Hij\u0101z, as well as the desert nomads. They were accompanied by their wives, sisters, and daughters, in large numbers, as well as by their sons. History frequently testifies to this; and, as town after town, city after city, was captured from the Romans, garrisons and governors of Arabian blood were placed in them. These last would be the picked men of the nation, more generally townsfolk, men of learning and refinement, as well as brave warriors and subtle negociators. The rank and file would be peasantry; the nomads would generally be skirmishers, and avoid town life.\n\nColonies and families of the Kelbite race are met with in all parts, as conquest extended. Bahdel, Meys\u016bn's reported father, may have been an officer, a subordinate governor, a merchant, a man of letters, a functionary of the new worship, a professor in a college, etc., as these were quickly founded.

It may, therefore, almost with certainty, be concluded that Ziy\u0101 Pasha gave a true and correct judgment when he recorded his marginal note to this little poem: \"By an unknown author.\" According as tastes vary, this\nsimple ditty may be pronounced sublime or commonplace, but that it was not indited or sung by Meys\u00fcn the mother of Yezid son of Mu\u2018awiya, is a moral certainty, though sectarian or dynastic rancour has succeeded in commonly coupling her name with it.\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nA study of the variously transliterated names connected with the so-called \u201cPoem of Meys\u00fcn,\u201d coupled with long-continued former tentatives on my part to elaborate a satisfactory system for the rational rendering of Arabic names, words, and sentences in English letters, as far as possible, has revived in me a desire to lay before the Council and Members of the Royal Asiatic Society a tolerably complete view of my present matured system, adapted to an approximatively correct scientific method of writing Arabic in our characters, so to say, as it is pronounced by professed reciters of the Qur\u2019an, on the basis of the special science called \u2018Ilmu-t-Tejwid \u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0643\u060c which may be translated Kalophonesis \u2018good enunciation.\u2019\n\nThis definition of the system naturally excludes any consideration of the ever-varying local, provincial modes of pronouncing vernacular Arabic, as practised by nations inhabiting different parts of the extensive regions, from Arabia to Morocco, where that language is the mother-tongue; and still more so, forbids any reference to the variously modified methods of pronouncing Arabic words and names by East Indians, Malays, Persians, Turks, etc. Of Ottoman pronunciation I have fully treated in my Ottoman Grammar recently published by Tr\u00fcbner and Co.\n\nEach one of such provincial dialects of Arabic, and each one of such national adaptations of Arabian words and letters, would require a special treatise for its elucidation in a\nner, of which each would be perfectly capable in\na competent master. But when to these we add\nmble resulting from attempts to transliterate the\nse modes of pronunciation by one unvarying\nhap-hazard, one is apt to sink down in despair.\none essay to write all the languages of Europe\nethodical English mode of spelling.\nion worse confounded is created by writers who,\nead the language, and casually visiting one or\nte Arabic-spoken countries, try their skill at\nEnglish letters or books, and guided by their\nalone, not only what they fancy the provincial\nbut also the vile composts that pass from\nith among ignorant laquais-de-place, self-styled\nr dragomans, of many a nationality; and when\naidance of their own, they add a medley of\noneous Arabic words or names copied from other\nhe other nationality, the ne plus ultra is reached\nmpiricism. Our newspapers and periodicals,\ncial correspondence, and our East-Indian com-\nrd ample proof of this, which need not here be\nupon.\n\nngular aberration of a highly-gifted mind, when\nready, though erroneous, rule had been enun-\nch transliterations, viz. \"all consonants as in\nall vowels as in Italian,\" that a great scholar\nto teach English university men, and others, to\nhorizontal straight stroke used over the long\nir school and college prosodial exercitations, and\npt the right-to-left-downward sloping \"dash\" of\n(e aigu), for the purpose of marking a long\nther eastern) vowel; informing them at the\nbrsmooth, that this is the Italian method. The\nno such usage. They never mark their long\ny way whatever. What they really do is to\nmark with that accent, in dictionaries only, the vowel of that syllable of a word on which the stress falls; and never do they use it in ordinary books or in writing. But, when such vowel is final, with the stress on it, they mark it in print and in writing with a dash sloping down from left to right, the French accent grave; as in facolt\u00e0, appi\u00e8, cio \u00e8, oggid\u00ec, verr\u00f2, virt\u00f9, etc.\n\nIt amounts almost to a national sin, to a crime of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9, when English scholars, men of truly profound learning, condescend, in English publications, to adopt the French method of transliteration;\u2014with its diphthongs, which do not exist in Arabic; with its accent circonflexe, ^, unknown in English, to mark the Arabic long vowels; with their erroneous o instead of the Italian u; and with their erroneous e in place of the Italian i. There is no vowel o in the whole Arabic language; though the consonant-ended combination \u064f\u0648\u064e, aw or ew (as the word or syllable is hard or soft) is vernacularly uttered by provincials in such a way that unaccustomed foreign ears take it for a vowel o. Still, this is a different thing to the systematic misrepresentation of the Arabic vowel u, which, short or long, is always pure, as in Italian. It must have been originally given to Jewish teachers of Arabic from Spain, whose pronunciation always has been abominable in every respect, to mislead Italian students in the middle ages, and make them sound the dzamma vowel as an o; and it is full time that so pernicious a practice were discontinued, both here and on the continent. The e instead of Italian i, above spoken of, has no basis whatever, except perversely erroneous and general French usage. The \"accent circonflexe\" of French orthography has a special history of its own, quite different from that of a true long vowel; but, as their writers have chosen to make this accent the sign of an Arabic long vowel, we need not complain, for we are under no compulsion to adopt their unscientific makeshift. To mark an Arabic long vowel in a\nEnglish and scholarlike manner, we have our legitimate, prosodial symbol, \u1e6d, straight and ought, unfortunately, I know of no technical How much more English and scholarly, how id more correct, to transliterate K\u0101tib, than to o K\u0101teb, or into K\u0101tib.\n\narked above, there are no diphthongs whatever in guage (nor, indeed, truly, in any language). aeously styled Arabic diphthongs, namely, a \u1e6d, followed by a consonantal w \u1e0d, or y \u1e0d, lable, are no more diphthongs than are ab, eb, The French, denying that final y is ever a having no w in their alphabet, attempt to s qanl, qayn, yem, beyn, by es kaoul, kain, iaoum, bein, etc.\n\nabic combination of an altogether different ), quite erroneously, denominated a diphthong here two vowels, belonging to two successive vord, are brought by transliteration into forced through the incorrect elision, owing to our ficiency, and lack of equivalents for the two nts, hemza \u1e6d, and \u2018ayn \u1e0d. These two letters, uly and as efficiently consonants, as are all the rabic alphabet in their primary values. They to European ears, a kind of hiatus or gulp cur, the hemza being soft, something in the i\u00e6resis or trema, while the \u1e0d is very harsh and unknown to us. They are, therefore, true, ants, though we may be unable to articulate re, both of them, capable of reduplication in on and grammar of a derived word, exactly nsonants; as in tefel \u201cela, \u1e6defal \u201cala; be conveniently transliterated by two distinct our ordinary apostrophe reversed, one turned\nto the left, the other to the right. The apostrophe is wanted in transliterating Arabic compound names and clauses, to represent a different incident that befalls some letters initial to words. Three signs of elision are therefore used in the present or proposed system, the ordinary apostrophe, ', indicating the omission of an initial letter in pronunciation; the inverted apostrophe turned to the left, ', showing the place of a consonant which we do not possess in our alphabet, the hemza; and the inverted apostrophe turned to the right, ' , to represent the harsh consonant 'ayn, which also our alphabet does not contain. All three are perfectly distinct; each represents a distinct Arabic letter; and retransliteration back into Arabic characters is kept free from all doubt. For, any system of transliteration, to be considered perfect, must represent unmistakably to the eye of the scholar the original letters, while it enables a reader who is unacquainted with the written characters of the original text, to read the words with a fair approximation to correctness, with a little practice. It is a lamentable error, propagated in our Hebrew grammars to the effect that the Hebrew equivalents to the Arabic * and \u00a3, namely N and Y, have no value, and go for nothing, etc. In ordinary books and newspapers, the apostrophe might be used for all three purposes; though the two inverted forms of it would always be preferable, in their respective places.\n\nAs is well known, the three Arabic short vowels are usually omitted in ordinary print and handwriting, having to be supplied in reading and speaking by the person who reads or speaks. He must know what vowels are omitted, or he cannot read; and of course he cannot converse unless he knows the vowels of his words. But in books used by learners, and in copies of the Qur\u2019an, etc., the vowels are marked, in whole or in part. They are called collectively hareka \u062d\u0631\u0643\u0629 \u2018movement, motion\u2019; by us, \u201cvowel-points.\u201d The three are, respectively, named fet-ha \u0641\u062a\u062d\u0629, kessa \u0643\u0633\u0631\u0629, and dzamma \u0636\u0645\u0629, which names mean, in their order, an\nbreaking,\" a \"folding\"; and their marks are \nTheir values are, respectively, \\(a\\) or \nare fully explained further on; thus: \n\\(\u0645\u064f\u062a\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651\u0643\u064c\\), \\(\u0645\u064f\u062a\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u0641\u064c\\), \\(\u0645\u064f\u062a\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651\u0643\u064c\\), \\(\u0645\u064f\u0643\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0651\u0645\u064c\\). \nie vowels that, in theoretic grammar, follow \nant of a word, whether they be the mark of a \nor of a result of conjugation in a verb, are \nted in the vernacular; and when the word \nis final in a sentence, they are omitted even \nQur\u2019an, subject to rules that are beside our \nrabic \u201clong\u201d vowels that correspond with the \nones mentioned above are the three letters \nall other circumstances): \\(\u0627\\), \\(\u064a\\), \\(\u0648\\), then called \nongation,\u201d \\(\u062d\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0641\u064c \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u062f\u064e\u062f\u064c\\) (sing., \n\\(\u062d\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0641\u064c \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u062f\u064e\u062f\u064c\\).

It is then \n\\(\u0625\u0650\u0644\u0650\u06cc\u064c\u0651\\), \\(\u0647\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0632\u064e\u0629\u064c-\u0625\u0650\u0644\u0650\u06cc\u064c\u0651\\), or simply, for brevity, \\(\u0647\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0632\u064e\u0629\u064c\\). \nif is really one and the same thing with \\(\u0647\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0632\u064e\u0629\u064c\\), \ncases is written as \\(\u0647\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0632\u064e\u0629\u064c\\) alone, without a \npport, as in \\(\u062c\u064e\u0647\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064e\u0627\\), \\(\u0634\u064e\u0647\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064e\u0627\\), etc. \nsonantal \\(\u0625\u0650\u0644\u0650\u06cc\u064c\u0651\\), this \\(\u0647\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0632\u064e\u0629\u064c\\), is capable, like every \nt, of taking every one of the three vowels, \nafter it in pronunciation; as it is also capable, \neing quiescent (as it is called); i.e. of being \nf thus ending a syllable. The subject of tl\nvarious conditions of hemza, or consonantal 'elif, is somewhat intricate, as is shown in the following paragraphs.\n\n1. When hemza is initial to an ordinary word (i.e. when it is not a hemza of junction, which see further on), and is followed by any one of the three short vowels, it always keeps the one, unchanging written form, like every other consonant. Thus, \u0623\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0636\u064f 'ar\u1e0d, \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0645\u064f 'anm, \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0649\u0652 'ins\u0101n, \u0623\u064f\u0635\u0652\u0644\u064f 'us\u016bl. With kesra vowel, the hemza sign is more generally placed, with the vowel-point, below the l; as \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064c etc.\n\n2. When hemza is initial to an ordinary word, but is followed by a long vowel, it still follows the foregoing rule of no change in its written form, so long as the vowel is heterogeneous to the hemza; i.e. when the vowel is either kesra or dzamma, as in \u0625\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0627\u062f\u064c ir\u0101d, \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 'ul\u0101. But, with the homogeneous long vowel, the two letters, consonantal initial l, and long-vowel l, coalesce into one sole letter l; and this one l is then marked in writing with a special symbol, ~, called medd \u0640\u064e, or medda \u0640\u064e\u0651 (\"prolongation\"); generally without, but sometimes, optionally, with the hemza sign; thus, \u0644\u064e\u0651\u0627 or \u0644\u064e\u0651\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0627 stands for \u0644\u064e\u0651\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0627, and is transliterated '\u0101l.\n\n3. When l is not initial to a word, other rules have to be observed. It may then be either movent or quiescen, i.e. followed or not, accompanied or not, by its own vowel in pronunciation; and this is tantamount to saying, in other words, that non-initial l may either begin or end a non-initial syllable in a word (exactly like every other consonant). Its rules in these cases vary greatly.\n\n4. When l, non-initial to a word, is initial to a syllable, whether its own vowel be short or long, we have to take notice of the vowel that accompanies the consonant preceding the l in the word, as well as its own vowel.\n\n5. If that preceding vowel, as well as its own, be the homogeneous short fet-ka \u0640\u064e, then l suffers no change in\nThus, *the'era*, *je'esha*, but if its own homogeneous vowel be long \u0101\u0301, ng short fet-ha, then \u0101\u0301 is written instead of \u0101\u0301; *ifa*, *ma'al*, etc.\n\nInitial hemza be preceded in the word by a short vowel, kesra or dzamma, its own vowel \u1e0d homogeneous and short, the \u0101\u0301 undergoes a change in its written form, and becomes \u1e0d\u0101\u0301nd \u1e0d\u0101\u0301 after dzamma; as, *ri'a*, *\u1e6di'a*, *thu'eba*, *ju'er*, *ru'es\u0101*, etc.\n\nIn this case, its own vowel be long, it then takes ther of the two forms given in the preceding is followed by that one of the three long-vowel \u1e6d\u0101\u0301, which is homogeneous with its own long \u1e6d\u0101\u0301, *ri'\u0101sa*, \u1e6d\u0101\u0301, *ri'\u012byy*, \u1e6d\u0101\u0301, *ri'\u012bs*, \u1e6d\u0101\u0301, *ri'un*, \u1e6d\u0101\u0301, *dhu'aba*, \u1e6d\u0101\u0301, *ru'a*, \u1e6d\u0101\u0301, *thu'ura*, etc.; times written \u0101\u0301; as, *irti'\u0101s* for *ir'ti'\u0101s*\n\nIf hemza's vowel in such case be short, and the l be short fet-ha\u0301, it still changes its written thus, *be'isa*, *be'usa*, *dhe'iba*, *re'ifa*, *re'u\u1e63a*, etc.\n\nceding vowel be short fet-ha\u0301, while its own nd heterogeneous, the change in written form e, but the long-vowel letter is added; as, *\u1e6di'm* is, *de'ub*, *re'uf*, etc. The second, os mistakenly, omitted in writing and printing these last two, even in copies of the Qur'\u0101n, for ancient use.\n\npreceding vowel be long fet-ha\u0301 \u0101\u0301, and the be short, it takes the written form of \u1e6d\u0101\u0301, \u1e6d\u0101\u0301 or \u1e6d\u0101\u0301, which vowel belongs to it; and the \u0101\u0301 of the vowel is marked with the medd sign \u0101\u0301; thus, *tefa'ela*, *mut\u0101'em*, *mut\u0101'em*,\nmutba'is, \u0645\u064f\u062a\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0651\u0639\u064c mutfa'il, \u0645\u064f\u0641\u064e\u0627\u0639\u0650\u0644\u064c muta'im, \u0645\u064f\u062a\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0645\u0650\u0651\u0645\u064c mur\u0101'il, \u0645\u064f\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621\u0650\u0644\u064c mudh\u0101'ir, \u0645\u064f\u062f\u064e\u0651\u062d\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064c th\u0101'ir, \u062b\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0631\u064c r\u0101'if, \u0631\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0641\u064c za'ir, \u0632\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0631\u064c q\u0101'il, \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0644\u064c teb\u0101'us, \u062a\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0639\u064f\u0633\u0652 tef\u0101'ul, \u062a\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0627\u0639\u064f\u0644\u064c etc. In this last case, \u0648\u064e, the vowel is sometimes long, as in \u0632\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0631\u064c za'ul. In some of such words the hemza is radical, as in \u0631\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0641\u064c r\u0101'if, etc.; in others it is servile and formative, as in \u0628\u064e\u0627\u0647\u0650\u0645\u0652 bah\u0101'im, etc.; and in others again it is a commutative substitute for a radical consonant \u064a\u064e or \u0648\u064e, as in \u0632\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0631\u064c za'ir, \u0633\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0631\u064c sa'ir, q\u0101'il, etc. This is a very difficult part of Arabic grammar.\n\n11. There are some, comparatively few, words in which \u0623\u064e is the second radical, and has short kesra, -\u060c for its vowel, while it is preceded by a short dzamma vowel '. It does not then conform in writing to that preceding vowel, but is written \u0629\u064b; thus, \u062f\u064f\u0639\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0644\u064c du'il, \u0630\u064f\u0647\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0628\u064e dhu'iba, \u0633\u064f\u0639\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0644\u064c su'il\u0101, etc.\n\n12. Non-initial hemza in a word, when initial to a syllable, may be immediately preceded by a quiescent consonant, marked in writing, when necessary, with the jezm \u062c\u064e\u0632\u0652\u0645\u064c sign over it \u060c which is also called suk\u016bn \u0633\u064f\u0643\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064c; the quiescent consonant then ends the preceding syllable of the word. The hemza, in such case, figures, in writing, as \u0623\u064b, \u064a\u064b, or \u0648\u064b, according to its own vowel, if short: thus, \u062c\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0644\u064c jey'ela, \u0645\u064f\u062a\u064e\u0645\u064c mut'im, \u0645\u064f\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621\u0650\u0644\u064c mur'ila; \u0628\u064f\u0648\u0631\u064c 'eb'ur, \u0623\u064e\u062c\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0645\u064c ej um, \u0623\u064e\u0630\u0652\u0631\u064c 'ed'ur, etc.; or as \u0623\u064b, \u064a\u064b, \u0648\u064b, if its own vowel be long; thus, \u0645\u0650\u062a\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064c mit'am, \u062a\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0633\u064c ter'is, \u0645\u064e\u062b\u0652\u0639\u064f\u0648\u0628\u064c meth'ub, etc. But \u0645\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0644\u064c and \u0645\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0644\u064c are sometimes found written for \u0645\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0644\u064c mes'ul.\n\n13. When medial (non-initial) hemza, being the second radical in a derivative word, is reduplicated, exactly in the same way with any other consonant of the alphabet, it ends one syllable, and also begins the next. It then still follows, in writing, the rules given above, whether its vowel in the second of those two syllables be short or long. Thus, \u062a\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0627\u0639\u064f\u0644\u064c tefe'ela, \u062a\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0627\u0639\u064f\u0644\u064c tefe'ul, \u0645\u064f\u062a\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0651\u0639\u064c mutefe'il, \u0645\u064f\u062f\u064e\u0651\u062d\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064c mudhe'ib, \u062c\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0628\u064c ja'ab, \u062c\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0631\u064c ja'ar, etc.\nmedial hemza, not being reduplicated, ends a written form depends entirely on the vowel of the 3, being written \u1e0d after fet-ha, \u1e0d after kesra, and \u1e41. Thus, \u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0633\u064e be's, \u062f\u064e\u0628\u064e de'b, \u062b\u064e\u0631\u064e the'r, \u062c\u064e\u0634\u064e ra, \u0631\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0639\u064e re'fa; \u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u064e bi'r, \u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0633\u064e bi'sa, \u062f\u064e\u062d\u064e dhi'b, \u0631\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e ri'l\u0101n, \u0632\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0642\u064e zi'baq; \u0628\u064f\u0633\u064e bu's, \u064a\u064e\u062f\u064e ya', \u0644\u064f\u0648\u064f lu'lu', \u0630\u064f\u0646\u064f dhu'nun, etc.\n\nmza is final in a word, it must form a syllable by own short vowel (or case-ending nunnation, s, -), then follow, either a quiescent consonant, or a mpanied by its following short or long vowel. \u062f\u0650 dif', \u062c\u064f juz', \u062f\u064e defe', \u062f\u064e defi', \u062c\u064e jeza', \u062f\u064e defi', \u0645\u064e mejzu', etc. The here given, exclusive of the case-endings, words are pronounced when they stand alone, e a full stop in a phrase or sentence. The \u0628\u064e\u062f\u064e'in, \u0628\u064e\u062f\u064e'i, \u0628\u064e\u062f\u064e'an, \u0628\u064e\u062f\u064e'a, need oned without detail, as there is nothing else to rom the other final consonants.\n\nbeginning of certain well-defined words only, hen any one of those words follows any other e or sentence, becomes elided in pronunciation ill written. It is then called the 'elif of \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0625\u0650\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064e 'elifu l-wa\u1e63l; and is marked with a called wa\u1e63la \u0644\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0635\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0629\u064b, placed over it thus, \u061f question are of four classes; viz. 1, the alone; 2, the ten following nouns: \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e, \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e, \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e, \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e, \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e, \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e, \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e, \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e, \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e, \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e, and imperatives regular of verbs of the first or and 4, every word of the seventh and follow- forms of verbs that begin with hemza, with the first person singular of the aorist tenses.\nIn transliterations of all these words, our apostrophe is the fitting sign of such elision.\n\n17. But, with regard to the definite article and this elision of its hemza when not initial in a sentence or solitary word, the further observation is needed that, in this respect, the Arabic alphabet of twenty-eight letters is divided equally into two classes of fourteen letters each, denominated respectively the \"lunar\" and the \"solar\" letters; because the words \u0642\u0645\u0631 qamer (the moon), and \u0634\u0645\u0633 shems (the sun) have their initial letters in the two classes respectively. The lunar letters, \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0641\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064f 'el hur\u016bfu 'l-qameriyya, are, \u0623, \u0628, \u062c, \u062d, \u062e, \u062f, \u0630, \u0631, \u0632, \u0633, \u0634, \u0635, \u0636, \u0638, \u063a, \u0641, \u0642, \u0643, \u0644, \u0645, \u0646, \u0647, \u0648, \u064a; while the solar letters, \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0641\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0634\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0633\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064f 'el hur\u016bfu 'sh-shemsiyya, are, \u062a, \u062b, \u062c, \u062d, \u062e, \u062f, \u0630, \u0631, \u0632, \u0633, \u0634, \u0635, \u0636, \u0638, \u063a, \u0641, \u0642, \u0643, \u0644, \u0645, \u0646, \u0647, \u0648, \u064a. The difference seen above in the two class-names is that when a noun, the initial of which is a lunar letter, \u062d\u0631\u0641 \u0642\u0645\u0631 harfun qameriyy, is shown to be definite by the article that precedes it, no further change occurs in the group beyond the simple elision of the initial \u062a of that article in its pronunciation; thus, \u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0622\u0644 \u0622\u0631\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0627\u062f q\u0101la 'l-'arw\u0101d, \u062f\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0651 \u0622\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0628 daqqa 'l-b\u0101b, \u062e\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0651 \u0622\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0628 khasefa 'l-b\u0101b, etc.; but, when the initial letter of the noun is a solar letter, \u062d\u0631\u0641 \u0634\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0633\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651 harfun shemsiyy, then, not only does the elision of the initial \u062a of the article take place as before, but the \u0644 also of that article is transformed, in pronunciation, though not in writing, into the initial solar letter of the noun, which is then marked by the sign of reduplication\u060c the jezm sign\u060c of the \u0644 disappears in writing, and the nasla sign\u060c is extended (in handwritings only, not in print) so as to cover the whole article \u0644\u061b thus \u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0622\u0644 \u0622\u0631\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0627\u062f q\u0101la 'r-resul, \u0634\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0651 \u0622\u0644\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0652 shaqqa 'th-thanb, \u062e\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0651 \u0622\u0644\u0652\u0634\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0633\u0650 kasefe 'sh-shems, etc.\n\n18. A penultimate long vowel in any Arabic word must\ny a consonant with its short vowel, or its\nid this consonant may be hemza, radical or\nas any other of the letters of the alphabet, all\nconsonants originally.

This appendix is not an Arabic grammar. It may, however, be usefully added as a fundamental axiom of the Arabic written and spoken language, that no Arabic word or syllable can really begin with a vowel, whatever European ears and minds may think; for, the initial hemza of a word or syllable is always a consonant, and represents the gentle but perceptible opening of the vocal passage. The \u0621, the hard or harsh analogue of the soft, gentle hemza, represents the strong, guttural hiatus or gulp of such opening or closing; and initial \u0621 or \u0648, in word or syllable, is always a consonant, y or w.\n\nBefore leaving the question of the Arabic vowels, it is essential to press home the conviction of the utter erroneousness, the mischievous misleadingness of the system adopted by our transliterators, that of using the combinations ah or eh to represent the Arabic feminine termination of nouns, which is, in fact, a consonant letter t s, and not a letter h s, at all. What has led to this serious European mistake, servilely adopted by so many unreflecting English scholars of incontestable merit, is that when a full stop follows such feminine noun,\u2014and every isolated word is naturally followed by such full-stop.\u2014its final s, called \u062a\u064e\u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064b ta'niyya 't-te'ni'th, t of femininity, as well as its case-vowel, disappears\ninciation. Thus, kelbetun, kelbetin, kelbetu, kelbetti, kelbeta, are ly pronounced kelba. But this pronunciation well be written kelb; only, this kelb, with ts marked, is not differentiated in any respect tive definite of the masculine kelb; and for ne, as in the parallel case of the termination s, a difference of terminal form, spoken and evised, to show the feminine noun without its l \u0161, when the word was followed by a full stop. form was, as said above, to drop the feminine \u0161 vowel, saying, for instance, kelba. The written rop the dots, the diacritical points, of the final hich thus became, in form, a \u0161; mimicking e when written, but never pronounced as one. irate \u0161 is always a radical letter, whereas a , and its undotted representative, unaspirated servile formative letter. A knowledge of es one to distinguish between such feminine ds really ending with radical, aspirated \u0161. d always should be, as scrupulously and as ed at the end of a word, in Arabic, as at the the middle; exactly as is the case with its analogue h. Thus, hubub, hubur, ruhm; tenbih, taqbih, etc. d \u0161, standing really for servile \u0161 at the end of n, is never aspirated; and, as it is always fet-ka vowel accompanying a preceding he same, final syllable of the word, it has of time, if not from all antiquity, to be id visible sign of a final unmarked fet-ka nine noun. It is, virtually, a fourth Arabic ed in Arabic at the end of feminine nouns (for bereka, etc.) bereka, (for birka,\nThis peculiar use of final (virtually) vowel \\( s \\) may be compared to the French usage of not pronouncing the final consonant or consonants of most words, when not followed by an initial vowel in the next word of the phrase or sentence, as in \"c'est lui,\" compared with \"c'est \u00e0 lui,\" etc. Europeans are misled by the similarly erroneous transliteration of feminine Hebrew Biblical names, such as Rebekah, and the like; but the true origin and value of the (virtually-vowel) final feminine \\( s \\) for \\( s \\), and its not being an aspirate, is correctly set forth in the present paragraph; and thus comes to a close the discussion of the Arabic vowels.\n\nThe consonants, that is, all the letters, of the Arabic alphabet, twenty-eight in number, have their isolated written forms, and their values, as nearly as our letters and combinations of letters (never more than two letters in one combination) can represent them, as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\text{\u0628} b, \\text{\u062a} t, \\text{\u062b} th, \\text{\u062c} j, \\text{\u062d} h, \\text{\u062e} kh, \\text{\u062f} d, \\text{\u0630} dh \\\\\n&\\text{\u0631} r, \\text{\u0632} z, \\text{\u0633} s, \\text{\u0634} sh, \\text{\u0635} sc, \\text{\u0636} dz, \\text{\u0637} t, \\text{\u0638} ts, \\text{\u0639} 'u, \\text{\u063a} g, \\text{\u0641} f, \\\\\n&\\text{\u0642} q, \\text{\u0643} k, \\text{\u0644} l, \\text{\u0645} m, \\text{\u0646} n, \\text{\u0648} w, \\text{\u0647} h, \\text{\u0649} y.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAs may be readily seen above, seventeen out of the twenty-eight Arabic consonants have letters in our English alphabet that exactly correspond with them in value, viz. \\( \\text{\u0628} b, \\text{\u062a} t, \\text{\u062c} j, \\text{\u062f} d, \\text{\u0631} r, \\text{\u0632} z, \\text{\u0633} s, \\text{\u0634} sh, \\text{\u0635} sc, \\text{\u0636} dz, \\text{\u0637} t, \\text{\u0638} ts, \\text{\u0639} 'u, \\text{\u063a} g, \\text{\u0641} f, \\text{\u0642} q, \\text{\u0643} k, \\text{\u0644} l, \\text{\u0645} m, \\text{\u0646} n, \\text{\u0648} w, \\text{\u0647} h, \\text{\u0649} y \\). None of these require any mark to distinguish them from others; but it may be here noticed that \\( \\text{\u062c} j \\) is pronounced like hard \\( g \\) in Egypt; that \\( \\text{\u063a} g \\) varies in pronunciation, softer or harder, and in a peculiar manner, in different places, and is frequently, but needlessly, represented by \\( gh \\); and that \\( \\text{\u0642} q \\) also varies in special ways. Those special peculiarities can only be learnt by ear, like our own\nThe \u0642 q, again, is by some still, and was, ill, written with a k in transliterations, and later distinguished from the \u0643, also shown by a k, by placed under it, k. But the very Arabic letter both our capital and small letters Q, q, are but of one original Phenician, old Hebrew, or old whence old Greek \u03a9 and Latin Q, q. s pronounced by Semitics with the same k, also directly derived from the Phenician; s were the first to confuse q and k, as they st every letter of the primitive alphabet; much did the Etruscans and Latins. Some writers epresent \u0642; but our c is the descendant, as is and the Greek \u0393, of the Phenician. It is ieous so to use a c, and as we now know the letters, as well as that of the Semitic characters, e gradually becoming unanimous in the use of \u0642, without putting the needless u after it.\n\nq\u0101bil, qabal, qir\u0101t, qireb, qur'\u0101n, etc.\n\nremaining Arabic consonants, three, \u0642 \u0644, stinguished, in transliteration, from three of the nteen, by a short stroke placed under them. has been used for this purpose; but as it is indistinct, a bold short stroke is preferable, and for handwriting; especially as a long for the letters of the class here following, as he long vowels, as explained above, when put\n\nArabic letters now left for explanation, our no equivalent single character. But our th combination, each, that exactly represents t rabic letter, viz. \u062b th, \u0634 sh. There is our th. It has in our language two val\nsoft in *thee*, sharp in *three*. The latter alone is the value of the Arabic \u062b; as in \u062b\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0628\u064f themb, \u0645\u0650\u062b\u0652\u0644\u064c mithl, \u0628\u064e\u062b\u0652\u0643\u064e bethth. We are therefore driven, in order to avoid doubt and ambiguity in transliterating, to adopt the modification *dh* to represent our value of *th* in *thee*, etc., which is the power of the Arabic \u0630 (a modified d); thus, \u0630\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0631\u064e dh\u0101ka, \u0630\u0650\u064a\u0628\u064e dhi'b, \u0630\u064f\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064e dhu'aba. Fitting examples of the power and transliteration of \u0634 are found in \u0634\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0633 shems, \u062a\u064e\u0634\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064e teshdid, \u062d\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0634\u064e hashish. It may be useful here to point out that \u062b is, in some parts, provincially sounded like s, and in other parts like t; while \u0630 is here sounded like d, there like z, just as French tyros sound our th.\n\nThree Arabic letters, again, \u062e kh, \u0636 dz, \u0638 ts, have no English equivalents in single or double letters, though we can manage to represent them in transliterations. The value of \u062e kh can be learnt from a Scotchman when he says *lock*, or from a German when he says *ach*. The reason for not taking ch to represent \u062e is, that ch is, in French, equivalent to our sh and German sch; also, that our ch, the equivalent of French and English tch, as of German tsch, is a useful representative of Sanskrit, Persian, and Turkish letters which do not exist in Arabic. But, the student must never pronounce \u062e kh as k, though this is natural in ordinary English and French readers. Until the correct sound is learnt, it would be far better to pronounce h, and not k, in such words as \u062e\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0648\u062c\u064f khuruj, \u062e\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u062c\u064f kh\u0101rij, \u0641\u064e\u062e\u0652\u0631\u064f fakhr, \u0641\u064e\u062e\u0652\u0631\u0650\u064a f\u0101khir, \u0633\u064e\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064f selkh, etc. (pron. huruj, h\u0101rij, fahr, f\u0101hir, selh).\n\nThe \u0636 dz is sounded as a d in some parts, and as a z in others. But it is the most characteristic letter in the Arabic language. A good professional or amateur reciter of the Qur\u02be\u0101n is as proud of his perfect pronunciation of this letter \u0636, as is a Parisian of his r grassey\u00e9 or as an Englishman of his accuracy in sounding such a medley as \u201cthough thou think the thing thine, this threefold thong thrown through\nshall thoroughly thwart thee.\" Hence, \u0646\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0630\u064e q\u0101\u02bezi, \u0646\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0630\u064e qabd\u017c, \u0641\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0644\u064e fadzl, \u0630\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0637\u064e dzabt, \u0645\u064e\u0630\u0652\u0628\u064f\u0648\u0637\u064e madzb\u016b\u1e6d.\n\nquently sounded provincially as a very hard z, the most disputable letter, as to its correct sound, Arabic alphabet. It is a sibilant modification of is the only possible value. Thus, \u062a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0644\u064f\u0645\u064e tsulm, \u0645\u064e\u062a\u0652\u0644\u064f\u0645\u064e matlum, \u0646\u064e\u062a\u0652\u0635\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e natsar, \u0646\u064e\u062a\u0652\u0633\u0650\u0631\u064e n\u0101tsir, \u0645\u064e\u062a\u0652\u0633\u064f\u0648\u0631\u064e hatsts, \u0645\u064e\u062a\u0652\u0633\u064f\u0648\u062a\u064e mahts\u016bts.\n\nx double consonant combinations for one Arabic st carefully be marked with a long line under , in Arabic words, the single letters composing ly occur separately in succession, and must be dependently.\n\nremain the hemza \u0647, \u0623, \u0621, \u063a, \u063a, already sufficiently and the \u2018ayn \u0639, also mentioned above, for which ter or combination of letters, is available. As e, they both represent the hiatus that introduces separates two vowels, in a word, by opening or e aperture of the vocal passage, and thus llable without the aid of an ordinary consonant and also the hiatus that closes a syllable after at such aid of an ordinary consonant or aspira-za being soft and gentle, the \u2018ayn being harsh attural. To represent such hiatus without a itations, the reversed apostrophes, \u2019 for hemza, opear the most appropriate symbols, as they arate two following vowels in two following word, by beginning the second syllable, as they any syllable, and also admit of reduplication l. Thus, \u0623\u064f\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064f \u2019emr, \u0623\u064f\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064f \u2019emir, \u2019\u0101mir, \u0631\u064e\u0623\u0652\u0634\u064f re\u02be\u0101s; \u0639\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064f umr, \u2019\u0101mir, \u0645\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0648\u0631\u064f fa\u02bf\u0101l.\nTwo passing remarks, even three to an Englishman, may be useful. 1. In Arabic writing, two separate letters never combine to form such combinations as our ch, tch, sh, ph, rh, th, or as French dj; or as German ch, sch, dsch, tsch, etc. But, on the other hand, juxtapositions occur commonly that are unknown in our tongue; such as \u0636\u0628\u062e sub-h, \u0641\u062a\u062d fet-h, \u0641\u0633\u062d fes-h, \u0642\u064a\u062f qid-h, \u0643\u0646 kun-h, \u0646\u0628\u064a nebih, \u062a\u0646\u0628\u064a tenbih, \u0645\u062a\u0646\u0645 mutenebbih, \u0623\u0628\u0644 ebleh, etc. 2. In Arabic, an aspirate must always be aspirated, wherever placed in a word, whether as an initial, as a medial, or as a final. The preceding words are instances of final aspirates, and they may be reduplicated when medial or final, like any other consonant; thus, \u0645\u0636\u062d mu\u1e63ahh\u012bh, \u0645\u0635\u0627\u0644\u062d musal\u1e25ah, \u0635\u062d\u0627\u0641 sa\u1e25\u1e25\u0101f, \u0645\u0643\u062d\u0644 mukhkhel, \u0643\u062d\u0644 kekh\u0101l. Initial and simple medial aspirates abound; as, \u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642 haq\u012bq, \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 hik\u0101ya, \u0647\u062f\u0645 hedm, \u0647\u0630\u064a\u0645 h\u0101dzm, \u0633\u0627\u062d sa\u1e25b, \u0633\u0647\u0645 sehlm, \u0635\u0627\u062d\u0628 sa\u1e25ib, \u0633\u0647\u0644 sehl, \u0645\u0634\u0647\u0648\u0631 mas-h\u016br, etc. Whenever an aspirate occurs in a transliteration so as to be preceded in the word by a consonant that, in English, would make a combination having the value of a single Arabic letter, the aspirate should, by way of precaution, be separated from the other consonant by a hyphen, to mark that they belong grammatically to two syllables. Several examples are seen above. 3. An Englishman should never allow letter r at the end of a syllable in an Arabic word to modify and debase the vowel that precedes it in the syllable, as is so general in English words. All Arabic vowels must always be kept pure in pronunciation, as vowels are always kept pure in Italian, and most other languages; no modification of their one sound each is in any case permissible.\n\nThe twenty-eight Arabic consonants are further divisible as to pronunciation, into two very distinct, but numerically unequal classes, \"soft\" and \"hard\" (or \"harsh\"). Nineteen are soft, \u0623, \u0628, \u062a, \u062b, \u062c, \u062e, \u062f, \u0630, \u0631, \u0632, \u0633, \u0634, \u0635, \u0636, \u0637, \u0638, \u063a, \u0641, \u0642, \u0643, \u0644, \u0645, \u0646, \u0647, \u0648, \u064a.\nresult of this division of the consonants is that 'ha vowel', when following one of the former in syllable, generally takes the value of our short e in ten, ten, etc.; whereas, in accompanying a con- hard class, it invariably takes the sound of our vowel a, as heard in the first syllable of the word n the indefinite article of the phrase a man. The - is also affected in an analogous manner to be rther on; but the vowel dzamma' is not so s having the Italian u value, short or long.\n\nlty experienced by an English student of Arabic, transliterating the vowels, does not arise from owels themselves, but from the uncertain, in- er-changing sound of our vowel-letters. Every owels takes, at times, the short surd value of a in s, her, fir, actor, but. Our East-India service the use of this u of but, us, etc., to represent hort fet-ha vowel in all cases invariably; and so. Thus we meet with Mohummud, Syud, etc. of our English vowels, moreover, has several fat, fate, father, fall, above; me, met, her; fir; go, got, shove; purity, pudding, gut. By is uncertainty, the deceptive, incorrect rule : \"the vowels as in Italian,\" the a to be as in father, e as in pet, i as in pin, o as in go, .

But, the occurrence of any one or more of the nine hard consonants in a word, wherever placed in it, has a tendency to cause the short surd a value to be assumed by the fet-ha of the nearest soft consonant, or even of any soft consonant in the word. This detail can be learnt only by hearing correct readers and speakers pronounce the words.\n\n3. Long fet-ha \u06e1 has two different values, also, with the two classes of consonants. With the soft class, it has the Italian sound of a, lengthened as in our word father (like French a in p\u00e2tre); but with the hard class, it no longer has the Italian or French sound, but becomes very similar to our broadest long a in wall, fall, call. We have no method to distinguish these two values in writing, and continental scholars are usually ignorant of their difference; neither can they mark it in any way. The class of the Arabic consonant marks the difference effectually, indubitably; and English scholars should emphasize this difference in their pronunciation of Arabic. Thus, \u0628\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u0632\u064e b\u0101riz, \u062a\u064e\u0627\u0628\u0650\u0639\u064e t\u0101si', \u062c\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u064a\u064e j\u0101ri, etc., as father; but \u062d\u064e\u0627\u0645\u0650\u0644\u064e hamil, \u062e\u064e\u0627\u0637\u0650\u0626\u064e kh\u0101\u1e6dir, \u0635\u064e\u0627\u062f\u0650\u0631\u064e s\u0101dir, \u0630\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e dzall, \u0637\u064e\u0627\u0647\u0650\u0631\u064e t\u0101hir, \u0638\u064e\u0627\u0641\u0650\u0631\u064e ts\u0101fir, \u0639\u064e\u0627\u0637\u0650\u0631\u064e 'atir, \u063a\u064e\u0627\u0628\u0650\u0646\u064e g\u0101bin, \u0642\u064e\u0627\u062f\u0650\u0631\u064e q\u0101dir, etc., almost like our broad a in hawk, vault, etc. There are a few well-known words in which the Arabic long-vowel fet-ha \u06e1 is dispensed with in writing, though still fully pronounced; such as \u0631\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e for \u0631\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064c; and \u0631\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0629\u064c is sometimes met with\nThe forms \u062d\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0629\u064c and \u0635\u064e\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0652\u062f\u064c are much used, from an archaic usage found in the Qur\u2019an.\n\nThe nineteen soft consonants, the short-vowel gain exactly represented by the Italian sound of fin, pit, etc. Thus: \u0623\u064e\u0630\u0652\u0639\u064e\u062f\u0652 idh, \u0628\u0650\u0646\u0652\u062a\u064e bint, \u062c\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0645\u064e tir\u0101ya, \u0631\u0650\u062f\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0627 ridya, \u0644\u0650\u0633\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e lis\u0101n, etc. With the esra \u064a\u0650 the sound is the same, but prolonged as ravine, fascine. Thus: \u0633\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e\u0629\u064c s\u012bra, \u0641\u0650\u064a\u0644\u064c fil,\n\nThe nine hard consonants, the short and the long-requires a sound of which we have no conception and which does not exist in French, Italian, or is well known in Russian, where it is represented vowel letter \u044b. Until its true sound can be , a student must of necessity pronounce it as the a short, and as the French i when long. Thus: \u0101n, \u062e\u0650\u062f\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0629\u064c khidma, \u0635\u0650\u0628\u0652\u063a\u064e\u0629\u064c sibga, \u0637\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0629\u064c tibq, \u0639\u0650\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e \u0101n; \u0635\u0650\u064a\u064e\u063a\u064e\u0629\u064c s\u012bga, \u062f\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064c dz\u012bf\u0101n, \u0639\u0650\u064a\u0633\u064e\u0649 \u2018isa, \u0642\u0650\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0637\u064c\n\nShort or long-vowel dzamma \u2019 or \u02bc, the two consonants make no difference of sound in Arabic, quantity, Italian u being always the model of \u02bc, burr, h\u016br, etc.\n\nThe remarks may usefully be added:\n\nTransliterating and pronouncing Arabic, never resonant unless to represent a teshdid \u02bc, in the always reduplicate such letter in writing and in as in \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651 rabb, \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0627\u0646\u0650\u064a\u0651 rabb\u0101niyy, \u0633\u0650\u0643\u0652\u0646\u064e sikkin, \u0645\u064f\u062a\u064e\u0651\u0641\u0650\u0642\u064e muta\u2019essif, etc. This rule is strictly all as Arabic. Englishmen, slaves to French double letters in words, and then pronounce in command, sunny, turret, etc. And yet we if fair, in nature, etc., correctly, sounding t\ntwo successive consonants; and it is just as easy to do so in the middle or at the end of one word.\n\n2. It will not have escaped the reader, that, in transliterating Arabic words that end with a short-vowel *fet-ha* after a soft consonant, the letter *a* has constantly been used in the present paper. This is merely a compliance with the necessities of English orthography, since we do not possess the French *\u00e9* or the German final value of *e*; and final *e* in an English word is always dropped in pronunciation, producing an effect on the preceding vowel instead. A final *a* has not this effect, though it does not truly represent the sound of Arabic *fet-ha* after a soft consonant. It is a vowel, one of the equivalents to *fet-ha*, and is more correct, by far more preferable, than the erroneous and objectionable *ah* or *eh* used by so many. It is an unfortunate necessity, and may sometimes be evaded in compound expressions, such as *q\u0101l al-\u02bfar\u1e63\u016bl q\u0101le-\u02bfr-res\u016bl*, etc.\n\n3. A very erroneous method of transliterating Arabic compound terms and sentences, prevalent all over the continent, as well as among English scholars, is, to sink the final vowel of a word, leaving its consonant bare; and then to treat the next word, commencing with an *\u02bfel\u012bf of union* \u064e, as though it were the initial word of a sentence, or an isolated word. Thus they write, for instance: *Jem\u0101l-ed-d\u012bn*, etc., instead of *Jem\u0101lu-\u02bed-D\u012bn* (*Jem\u0101li-\u02bed-D\u012bn*, *Jem\u0101la-\u02bed-D\u012bn*), etc. It is a most reprehensible practice, and a careful student should break himself of it as speedily as possible. De Sacy (Gram. Ar. vol. i. pp. 79-81, seconde \u00e9dition) transliterates correctly in this respect; and Wright (Gram. of Arab. Lang. vol. i. pp. 19-22) gives the correct rules on this point.\n\n4. When a word commencing with an *\u02bfel\u012bf of union* stands alone, begins a discourse, or comes after a full stop or pause, or after a word ending with a quiescent consonant, a vowel must be borrowed for that initial \u064e, as is said, from our own...\npocket, or mind. It is always fet-ha with the initial definite article, which then becomes pronounced as \u0622\u0644 'el; and so it is with \u0623\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0646\u064f, which becomes \u0623\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0646\u064f 'eymen. But with the other nine nouns, if initial, \u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064f, \u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064f, etc., kesra is borrowed, and they become \u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064f 'ibn, \u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064f 'ibna, etc. For the \u062a of the verbs, too many rules exist to be given here. But, when these various classes follow a word ending with a quiescent consonant, it is this consonant that borrows the vowel required, and then becomes movent. The special rules must be studied in a grammar.\n\nThe following words and names are offered as examples of the system advocated, with instances (in parentheses), gathered from various sources of great authority, of different kinds of erroneous transliteration:\n\n\u0623\u064e\u0628\u0650 'eb (ab).\n\u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0629\u064f 'Ebreha (Abrahah).\n\u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u063a\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650 'Ibnu 'l-Mug\u0101wir (Ibn el-Moghawir).\n\u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064f \u062c\u064f\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u064d 'Ibnu Jubeyr (Ibn Jubair).\n\u0623\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648 'eb\u016b (ab\u016b).\n\u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0622\u0621\u064f 'Ebw\u0101' (Abwa).\n\u0623\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648 \u0633\u064f\u0641\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064f 'Eb\u016b-Sufy\u0101n (Ab\u016b-Sofy\u0101n, Abu Sufiyan).\n\u0623\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648 \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0628\u064d 'Eb\u016b-Leheb (Abu Laheb).\n\u0623\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648 \u0647\u064f\u0631\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0629\u064c 'Eb\u016b-Hureyra (Abu Horeira).\n\u0623\u064e\u062e\u0652\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064f Ikhm\u012bm (Akmim).\n\u0623\u064f\u0633\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064f Usw\u0101n (Assouan).\n\u0623\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0648\u0652\u0646\u064e 'Ushm\u016bneyn (Ashmuneim).\n\u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064e\u062f\u0652\u0633\u064f el-Quds (Al-Kods).\n\u0623\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0637\u064e\u0627\u0633\u064f 'ewt\u0101s (Autas).\n'ewq\u0101f (aukaf, efkaf, evcaf).\nBa\u1e63ra (Bassorah, Basrah).\nBu\u1e63r\u0101 (Bostra).\nBekru 'bnu Wa\u2019il.\nBekru Wa\u2019il.\n(Bakr-W\u0101il).\nBeyd\u0101\u2019 (Baid\u0101').\n'Et-Tellu 'l-Keb\u012br (Tel el-Kebir).\nTeyma\u2019 (Teymah).\njebeleyn (obl. of jebel\u0101n, dual of jebel a mountain) two mountains (gebel\u0113n).\nJidda, Judda (Jeddah).\nJudeyda (Jedaydah).\nJizza (Egypt.

The actual site of the old city is marked by mounds and remains of walls, and on an isolated rock in the middle of the valley are the considerable ruins of what appear to have been the acropolis, now known as Gh\u00falgh\u00fala.\n\nBut the most famous antiquities of B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n are certain standing figures of enormous size, carved in the conglomerate rock on the sides of the gorge. These images, which have been much injured by cannon-shot, are cut in niches; both images and niches have been coated with plaster, whilst the plastered surface of the niches has been painted with figures. As seen from the rock of Gh\u00falgh\u00fala, B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n, with its numerous grottoes, and with the singular red colour of its soil, presents an impressive aspect of desolation and mystery.\n\nThe history of B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n is very obscure. There is nothing on which to found an identification of the place with any name handed down in the classical geographers or historians of Alexander. The earliest mention of the kingdom and city of B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n is in the travels of (the Chinese) Hwen T'sang, A.D. 630; but his account does not determine the race either of the inhabitants or of the reigning prince. We know also that at a much later date B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n was, for half a century, the seat of a branch of the Ghor\u00ed or Shansab\u00e1nya dynasty, which came to an end in 1214. Major Raverty, in his translation of the \u1e6caba\u1e33at-i-N\u00e1siri (p. 427), quotes Persian historical writers to the effect that the proper name of the city was R\u00e1sif, or the like. But it is no uncommon circumstance in Asiatic geography for the name of a kingdom or territory to usurp and practically to extinguish the name of the capital. In 1222 the place was taken and utterly destroyed by Chingh\u00edz Kh\u00e1n, and I am not aware of any later records of B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n\u2019s history. The character, however, of the ruins of Gh\u00falgh\u00fala, and concurring local tradition, indicate that the city must have been rebuilt since the time of Chingh\u00edz, and again destroyed.\nidols, as has already been said, have constituted attracting chiefly attention to Bami\u00e1n. They believe, alluded to by any of the early Arab at least in any works that have been printed. Yes that they are mentioned by Sharafu-d Yezd in his History of Timur; if so, this be the earliest Persian mention: but I have to find such a passage in the translation by Croix. Hyde, in his History of the Religion of Persians (ed. 1760, pp. 229\u2013230), quotes mention two Persian writers, viz. the Mas\u00e1l\u00edk wa Mam\u00e1lik\u00b9 ing Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. There is also mention of them Akbari (Blochmann\u2019s Text, vol. i. p. 590, and ans. vol. ii. p. 168). Hyde, whose book was in 1700, was apparently the first European k of the images.\u00b2 After him we have Wilford, the Asiatic Researches. Wilford\u2019s exertions in owledge were most praiseworthy, but, un- r his reputation, he never would publish the hich he acquired with great labour and cost, g it up with a large amount of his own fan- baseless speculations, to say nothing of the ch were imposed upon him.

Mr. Delmar Morgan, ever ready with help, has kindly furnished me with a translation of the passages relating to Bami\u00e1n in this last work, but I find nothing in them of sufficient value or novelty to transcribe.\u00b9\n\nThe best of the modern accounts of Bami\u00e1n till the present time is, I incline to think, Moorcroft's. His estimate of the height of the images is much nearer the truth than that of Burnes, whilst he distinctly recognizes the Buddhistic character of the remains. Elphinstone, writing in 1814, however, already says: \"The learned in Indian antiquities are of opinion that these idols are connected with the worship of Boodh, and their situation strongly reminds one of the colossal statues at the entrance of the great temples, supposed to belong to the religion of Boodh, in the midst of the city of caves, which is to be seen at Canara (Kanheri) in Salsette.\"\u2014Caubool (orig. 4to. edition), p. 487. I do not know to what expression of opinion by the learned, Elphinstone can here refer, except to the words of Wilford (Asiat. Res. vol. vi. p. 463), who says the place was considered at an early period to be the metropolis of the sect of Buddha, whence Buddha-Bamiy\u00e1n, which he alleges the Mussulmans corrupted into But- (or Idol) Bamiy\u00e1n. But any idol would be but, Buddha or not.\n\nWilford got his information on the subject, at least in part, from a Sayad called Miy\u00e1n Asad Sh\u00e1h, who had visited Bami\u00e1n ten or twelve times.\n\nWith regard to Elphinstone's allusion to Salsette, Masson also says: \"I have recently visited the Buddhist temples in the island of Salsette, and certainly there can be no doubt of the resemblance between the colossal figures of Buddha in them and those of the Bami\u00e1n niches\" (Various Journeys, vol. ii. p. 384).\n\nThe publication in French, by Julien, of the Life of Hwen\n\n\u00b9 See also in Panjab Notes and Queries for February, 1886, p. 81.\nshowed how just Moorcroft's surmise\nthe Chinese traveller found at B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n ten con-\nbout 1000 monks belonging to the \"Little\nHe goes on: \"To the N.E. of the royal city\nountain, on the declivity of which is placed a\nof Buddha, erect, in height 140 or 150 feet.\nes sparkle on every side, and its precious orna-\nthe eyes by their brightness.

The\naccount of this object is contained in a paper\nral E. Kaye, of the Royal Artillery (Bengal),\nwhich was printed for the first time in the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society for 1879, though the observations date from 1840. He says:\u2014\"On the opposite side of the valley (i.e. from the images), about a mile to the west, a stony gully leads into the hills; a short way up this there is a nearly isolated rock, on the flat summit of which there is in relief a recumbent figure bearing a rude resemblance to a huge lizard, and near the neck of the reptile there is a red splash, as of blood. This is called the Azdahar, or dragon, said to have been slain by Ali or some Mahomedan saint of bygone days, and an indentation in the rock close by is held to be the gigantic footprint of the slayer\" (p. 249).\u00b9\n\nIn the same volume (p. 338) I made a suggestion to which I now recall attention, that this Dragon (which, however, General Kaye terms \"a recumbent figure in relief\") is really the Nirvana Buddha of Hwen T'sang. There is a difficulty, no doubt, in the direction, which the modern travellers give as west or north-west of Bami\u00e1n, whilst Hwen T'sang places it to the eastward. Another difficulty has been suggested from the account of Mohun L\u00e1l, who calls the dragon \"fifty feet in length.\" But in this there is probably some mistake. For Masson says this Azhdaha of Bami\u00e1n is \"analogous in character to that of Bis\u00fat, but of much larger size\" (vol. ii. p. 395). Now, turning to his account of the Azhdaha of Bis\u00fat (the province immediately south of Koh-i-Baba), we find it thus described: \"The Azdha of Bis\u00fat is, indeed a natural curiosity, which the creative imagination of the Hazaras supposes to be the petrified remains of a dragon, slain by their champion Hazrat Ali.... It is, geologically speaking, of volcanic formation, and a long projected mass of rock, about one hundred and seventy yards in length,\" etc. \"I afterwards found that an analogous mass of rocks, but of much more imposing size, occurs in the vicinity of Bami\u00e1n, and is alike supposed to represent a petrified dragon\" (ib. pp. 357-359).\n\n\u00b9 Both this dragon and another in the neighbourhood are mentioned, as Sir F. Goldsmid kindly points out, in Daud Khan's Visit to Afghanistan, etc., 1872, printed by the Panjab Government.\nlude by remarking that some one has suggested remember who, it may have been General , or it may have been *moi qui vous parle*, that those long graves, which in Afghanistan and India shown as the tombs of holy giants (*ch\u00e2ts gazi*, t), really mark the sites of Buddha-in-Nirv\u00e2na ch graves are mentioned, in Bis\u00fat, by Masson in Laghm\u00e1n, the graves of Lot and Lamech, by l. iii. pp. 195\u2013197).

First and lowest down, Chahilburj. This I did not see, but I send Maitland's description: \"Chahilburj is 28 miles from Z\u00e1ri, on the road to Balkh by the Balkhao, standing on a semi-isolated hill at the point at which a large ravine, down which the road comes, joins the main stream. It is at the East end of the Sokhtagi Valley. The road at present forks just below the fort, so that it commands the junction. The remains are those of a fortress of considerable size, and consist of three lines of walls with towers at very close intervals. The walls are in parts fairly perfect, but from a casual inspection I should say that the lower wall was never carried all round the hill. It certainly existed on the south side and on the east side, though now carried away by a landslip. The original height of the walls I should estimate at 50 or 60 feet: the towers are of the same height and large diameter. The walls and towers are all built of very large sun-dried bricks, except the lower courses, which are of stone and mud.\n\nThe shape of the loopholes is peculiar (see Pl. I. Fig. 1). I noticed three tiers of such loopholes in a tower still standing on the higher portion of the hill.\n\nThe three lines of walls are all about the same height, but being built on a steep slope each commands the one outside it. Inside the walls, remains of some buildings were visible. The plateau west of and below the fort is inclosed by a wall originally 10 or 12 feet high and several feet thick, built of rough stone imbedded in mud. The space inclosed may have been the site of a small town. There is a tradition that a portion of it was originally the site of a bazaar.\n\nOn the south side of the fort, and under a low scarp facing the base of the hill on which the fort is built, are several chambers, some of which are slightly sunk into the face of the scarp and appear to have been divided by mud-brick walls: some are sunk almost entirely into the hill and below the surface of the ground. They have round arches and round arched recesses.\"\n\nAnother place is the Shahri Barbar, some 35 miles higher\nthan Chahilburj. It is situated in the fork of the water from the Band i Amir with that and Firozbahar. It consists only of a wall north and only accessible side of a plateau above the valley, and must only have been of refuge. The wall is built of uncut but all of much the same size and shape, roughly e inch side, arranged in straight courses king joint, sometimes not. The wall is eight high and about eight feet thick. In a low plateau there are four holes eight to twenty ently to collect rain or snow-water. There mud buildings. At one point, built in the wall, are some small domed chambers: the in the usual manner.\n\ncalled respectively Darali and Sarikol, at Balkhao, are a good many caves\u201450 or 60, ose in the Darali were all inhabited, and mud built in front of them, hiding the shape of\n\nvalley I visited several.

Just below the fort of Gawargin is a mound which looks like a tope. Near the top a piece of flat wall is exposed, which must, I should say, have been part of the relic chamber, as it appears to have been in the centre of the tope.\n\nI spent four days at Bamian, but could give only a very small portion of that time in visiting the antiquities.\n\nTo begin with the figures: there are five.\n\n1. First the big idol, male. The passage up to the top of this is broken away, so I measured it with my theodolite and found it to be 173 feet high. It is sunk in a niche, so as to be protected from the weather. The shape of the niche is something like Pl. I. Fig. 3.\n\n2. A female figure 120 feet high, measured by Maitland with a tape. The passage up to the top is still accessible.\n\nThere are paintings on the roofs of the niches of both these figures. In the case of the latter some have been copied.

The niche of the female figure is irregular, and looks as if it had been left unfinished.\n\n3. A smaller figure, 50 or 60 feet high, estimated. This figure has almost entirely disappeared.\n\n4.

Talbot's Letter, by William Simpson.\n\nA number of travellers have passed Bamian at various times, and have given notices of the colossal figures and the caves, but they have brought away only vague details of them. Captain Talbot's letter supplies us with the first instalment of accurate information regarding this wonderful place; and the details are so valuable, that I scarcely like to utter the wish that he had sent us more of them, as such an expression might seem to indicate a want of thankfulness for what we have received. We must remember that Captain Talbot is very devoted to his duties in the Survey Department, and that he was only four days at Bamian.\n\nAs far as I can make out from Captain Talbot's letter, he and Captain Maitland, one of the political department with the Afghan Boundary Commission, came from the north-west, where the camp of the Commission was during the summer months, and dropped into the valley of the Hari Rud, probably on the east of Obeh. They followed up the valley as far as Daulatyar, which is near the junction of the Tingab and the Jangal Rivers; from this they moved east to the sources of the Balkh River,\u2014called in the letter Balkh-h\u00e1o(\u00e1b). Capt. Maitland here visited Chahilburj, on this stream, from whom Captain Talbot quotes an account of that\nThe Large Male Figure at Bamian.\nFrom a sketch made in 1842, by Lieut-General Sir Vincent Eyre, K.C.S.I.\nite after that was still east to Bamian, from which\nth on the regular road towards Khulum; and the\nen at Haibak, about forty miles to the south of\nie ground gone over is, the most of it, new to us.\nd from somewhere about Balkh or Khulum to\nroute was to the westward of Talbot\u2019s; he struck\nd Valley, passing by Singlak, about twenty or\non the west of Daulatyar.

This peculiar arch is also given in Pl. I. Figs. 4, 6, and 7.\n\nFig. 5 in Pl. I. is a form I cannot pretend to explain. The small semicircular form on the top seems to be a not uncommon characteristic, for it appears again in Figs. 13, 18, and 19; and in Figs. 12 and 14 we may perhaps have the same structural idea in another form. The origin of the trefoil arch is, I think, not yet quite clear; and in this peculiar feature, in which we see what may be possibly varieties of it, there is just a chance of new light coming to us on this point. On my late visit to the Afghan frontier, I saw a great amount of what I call \"Mud Architecture,\" that is, mud and sun-dried bricks. Wherever wood for rafters was scarce, the sun-dried bricks were thrown over the roof in the form of a vault or dome, and the process I believe goes back to a very early period; this particular construction might account for the form under consideration,\u2014but I only hazard this as a guess,\u2014and leave the matter in that position till further light turns up.\n\nThe pointed arch in the caves lately discovered in the Murghab Valley produced in my mind what seemed about the only reason which might stand against their having been Buddhist. Fig. 10 thus becomes important, for it gives us the exact outline of the section of the Murghab Caves, and shows that the form did exist in that part of the world at the Buddhist period. Fig. 11 is very nearly the same form. When the paper on the Murghab Caves was read, Mr. Thornton called attention to the fact that the pointed arch was found in the Buddhist remains of the Yusufzai country. Since then I have looked over my own sketches, photographs, books, etc., and I have to confess that I had not then given the point that attention which it deserves, and I am glad Mr. Thornton mentioned the matter. The Buddhist arch was round originally,\\(^1\\) but as the style travelled from its source, the forms were often rudely followed, and across the Indus this arch will be found round, oval, at times faintly\n\n\\(^1\\) In the Lomas Rishi Cave a pointed arch will be found.\nDetails of Buddhist Architecture to illustrate the Forms found at Bamiyan.\noften it becomes a pointed arch; so often, in\nconsider it quite sufficient to account for the\nBamian and in the Murghab Valley.

It is one of the primitive forms of architecture in that part of the world, and it is most interesting to see it appearing as prominently at Bamian.\n\nCaptain Talbot describes these sketches as representing porches in front of the caves. This is a peculiarity of which I cannot recollect anything of the same kind in the caves of the Jal\u00e1lab\u00e1d valley. It may have existed, but many of them were so ruinous, particularly in the front, that it was difficult to say what they had been originally.\n\nMost of the caves at Bamian are domed; in the Jal\u00e1lab\u00e1d valley this is not the case; there are at Hada only a few square caves with domes in the roof. In one of these there was the base of what had been either a sitting Buddha or a small Stupa, under the dome. I am interested in Captain Talbot\u2019s identification of these domes with the modern manner of building with \u201ckacha,\u201d which means sun-dried, \u201cbricks.\u201d In Persia I made a similar sketch to that in Pl. I. Fig. 15; it, and some others I made of \u201cmud architecture,\u201d were done on account of ideas they suggested in relation to Buddhist architecture. I may yet write about them, but at present they are to me far from certainties; naturally, I feel encouraged by Captain Talbot\u2019s suggestions on the domes, but it may be recalled that in my paper on the Buddhist caves of Afghanistan,\u00b9 I have put it that the caves of the Jal\u00e1lab\u00e1d valley were copied from the early caves at Barabar, near Buddha Gaya: now, in three of these, the Lomas Rishi, Viswa Mitra, and the Sudama Caves, there are domed chambers. Here I think we have an explanation which is sufficient to account for the domes; but it must be confessed that it is only theoretical, and we may have yet to accept the \u201cKacha brick\u201d explanation in its stead, which would give a Central Asian, rather than an Indian, origin to this particular form in Afghanistan.\n\nCaptain Talbot says he saw no Vihara caves, but some were described to him. They are square rooms; in one case\n\n\u00b9 *Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society*, Vol. XIV.

Maitland. On submitting them to Colonel Yule, it was arranged that they should be added to this, and I have been asked to supply a few notes to them.\n\nCaptain Maitland's name has already been mentioned; he accompanied Captain Talbot as Political Officer, and the drawings sent home were copies of his sketches, made by Bhayron Bakhsh, a Brahmin attached to the camp of the Afghan Boundary Commission, and a pupil of the School of Art at J\u00e1\u00edp\u00far.\n\nUnfortunately no descriptions came home with the drawings; so some slight explanation of them has to be given. Plate IV. represents that portion of the cliff at Bamian where the second statue stands, which is seen with the caves on the right and left of it. On the extreme left is, what Captain Talbot numbers as the fourth statue, a sitting figure. The largest statue does not appear in this plate, but it stands still further to the left, and according to Sir Vincent Eyre, is about 400 yards from the second one.\n\nThe arrangement of the verandahs in front of the caves, described by Captain Talbot, can be seen in this plate; and the peculiar forms drawn and described by him, although only roughly sketched in this case, can be easily identified. On the top of the cliff are a number of elevations, which I take to be mounds, most probably the remains of ruined stupas; in the Jalalabad Valley in almost every instance where there were caves in a scarp, there were similar mounds of stupas above them; and the great probability is that it is the same here. The largest mound, it will be noticed, is exactly over the statue. Burnes says that the rock at Bamian is \"indurated clay and pebbles.\" Sir Vincent Eyre describes it as \"that species of conglomerate known by the name of pudding-stone, consisting of very\nhickly studded with various kinds of rounded\nn the level ground underneath the statue there\nvillage.\n\nrepresents the first and the largest of the\nat Bamian; and as it is evidently carefully\nives minute details, it is particularly valuable,\nt rest all doubts as to the character of the\nluen Tsiang distinctly states that it was a\ndha, and Masson identified it with the Buddhist\nad seen at Saleste. Now we have the safer\nhis drawing of Capt. Maitland's to guide us, and\noubt on this point.

The suggestion which\no account for this is, that the sculptor, or\ne brought from India, and that the design was\nby the local artists. Sir Vincent Eyre noticed\nhe small holes which are represented in the\nis figure, and he makes the following remarks\nm:\u2014\"One circumstance struck me as remark-\nas, that in all those parts where the limbs are\nare regular rows of small holes, in which\nhave been struck, for the evident purpose of\ner adhere. From this it would appear either\nnpt had been made to restore the mutilated\nmeans, or that the figure was originally only\nctured in the rock, and the deficiencies made\ner in the manner I have mentioned.\" The\n'imur-lang may have shot arrows, and the\nof Nadir Shah may have fired cannon at the\ncelebrated idols, this being what the people of the locality believe, but no one would have taken the trouble since the Mohammedan period to make any repairs; we can only suppose that these efforts date back to the time when there were Buddhist monks at Bamian. If the small holes had been all over the figure, it might have been supposed that it had been covered with metal; but we can perceive in the drawing, as Sir Vincent Eyre says, that they are only on the mutilated parts. It will be seen from the drawing that both Burnes and Sir Vincent Eyre correctly described this statue as having the upper part of the face destroyed, the mouth being the only feature which had been preserved. Captain Talbot measured this figure with the theodolite, and gives the height as 173 feet; it must be the highest statue known, and a good notion of its size may be formed by comparing it with the London Monument, which is only about 27 feet greater in height; or the Nelson Column in Trafalgar Square, it being 170 feet, or 3 feet less than the statues.\n\nPlate VI. represents the smaller statue, which stands, as already stated, about 400 yards to the right of the larger one, and is 120 feet high; this has been generally known as the \"female idol,\" but it is now evident that Hiuen Tsiang had correctly described it as \"a figure of Sakya Buddha.\" He also describes it as being formed of metal, \"it has been cast in different parts and joined together;\" the folds of the drapery are yet so carefully given in the figure, that we must suppose it had only been covered with a thin plating of metal, and not with plates which had been cast; this is confirmed by the absence of holes or any indications by which heavy pieces of metal could have been fastened and supported. The larger figure was in all probability gilt, for the pilgrim says that \"its golden hues sparkle on every side,\" and whatever metal was used in the smaller figure, must have been so thin, that it was made to keep its place by means of some adhesive substance. Captain Talbot says in both figures \"the finishing, drapery, etc., was all by putting on stucco.\" This is all but decisive against\nDamian Paintings of Ornaments and Figures.\nbeing fixed on it; as there would have been, no need to finish the details with stucco. cut in the rock, by means of which visitors look out at the head of the statue, and the crown is represented in the drawing. states that the passage to the top is still from the context of his brief statement we see that it was by this means Captain Mait- measure the statue with a tape.\n\nves us what, in comparison to the colossal, we must call a small statue.

Talbot has come to hand since receipt of the others. As it gives probably the first account of the \"Takht-i-Rustam\" in this locality, it is now published with the drawings which accompanied it. Haibak, I may mention, is on the road from Bamian to the Oxus, and as there are many groups of caves along the whole route, the paper in question appears an appropriate addendum to those preceding it.\u2014W.S.]\n\nLETTER.\n\nCamp, Kili, March 2nd.\n\nMy Dear Simpson,\n\nI hope my letter from Bamian way reached you safely and proved interesting. I have not much more to add. At Haibak, about two miles west of the fort, is a very curious place called Takht-i-Rustam. Possibly it has been fully described before; but in case it has not, I send you a plan and description. [See figures on opposite page, Pl. IX.]\n\nIt is entirely cut out of the rock; there has been no building up whatever. Simply the top of a rocky hillock has been cut into the shape I describe. It is not situated on quite the highest point of the hillock, and could never have been intended for a fortification of any sort.\n\nIt consists of an annular ditch cut out of the rock to a varying depth on the west side, at perhaps its deepest point. I found it to be $38\\frac{1}{2}$ ft. from the top of the counterscarp, to use a military term. The conical mass of rock left standing in the centre has been levelled to form a circular platform about 70 ft. in diameter, the top of the scarp being neatly bevelled off. In the centre of the platform stands a rectangular house, also cut out of the solid rock. A doorway and passage from the south side leads into a circular domed\nTakhti Rustam near Haibak.\n\nM. G. Talbot, Capt., R.E.\nin diameter and 6 ft. 6 ins. high. You will find drawings there is a discrepancy as to the height of the passage. I am pretty sure that the enlarged drawing shows the position of the doorway correctly, and also that the drawing is correct as to the way the passage leads into the chamber.\n\nI must therefore have got my dimensions wrong, because the chamber cannot be situated exactly in the manner shown.\n\nI believe that this is a sort of tope, and that the chamber contains an image of Buddha, but you know my opinion is not worth much, and as I send you all I know about it, you may draw your own conclusions.\n\nThe platform and house is quite perfect, and made of stone and neatness. Access is had to it from the north by means of holes cut in the escarp, similar to those used in gymnasia for escalading exercise, which enable one to climb up from the ditch, which is here less than 10 feet deep. The bottom of the ditch is level, and the width and slope. The ditch is deepest on the west side, and slopes up to the east from both sides. The ditch is not in all but one place, where a small portion of the wall has fallen away. On the east side are the remains of the counterscarp, looking inwards, and on about 20 feet above the platform. Most of them have fallen in.\n\nAccess is had to the ditch by two passages cut in the rock face. The northern of these issues is some 6 ft. below the level of the ditch, for what object I cannot conjecture. The other issues are at the level of the bottom of the ditch.\n\nA large issue from the ditch on to a platform cut out of the rock. The rock is of a grey colour, and does not appear to be very hard, but has weathered well. I am not geologist enough to say what it is.\n\nOn the summit of a neighbouring hill, some 300 yards off, are several more caves facing towards the Takht. I should like to hear if you know of any similar place.\n\nThe road from Haibak to T\u00e1shkurgh\u00e1n is a place called K\u00e1mam, or 1000 caves. It consists of a large\nnumber of caves excavated in low cliffs, 10 to 20 ft. high, surrounding a depression in undulating ground. It is 18 to 20 miles from Takht-i-Rustam. Many of the caves have fallen in. Those that remain seem to be nearly all of one plan\u2014a large outer room leading by an archway into a smaller room approaching a square in plan. In some cases the outer room has small rooms leading off from it; and in several cases contiguous outer rooms are connected with one another by side passages in an irregular sort of way. Altogether they seemed to be nearer the pattern of Vihara caves than anything else I have seen.\n\n[The larger of these figures represents the plan of the cave.\n\nThe smaller approximately illustrates a niche which the writer noticed at the inner end of the inner chamber.]\n\nThe outer doorways have most fallen in, and in none could I trace any definite shape; but the doorways into the inner rooms are mostly perfect and vary in shape: as a rule they have a niche on each side of them. I show two patterns of doorways and the position of the side niches. The niches also vary in shape: some are as I have tried to draw.\n\nYou must understand that when I draw an arch, I mean it to be symmetrical, though I fear I am not often successful.\nf both outer and inner rooms were originally plaster, of which a good deal remains, showing designs and remains of colour. In one case I thing very like a fleur-de-lis. My usual complaint time holds good here: I only had half an hour caves. It would have taken a whole day to do y. There are a great number of them.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nM. G. Talbot.\n\n[Note on Bamian by Capt. P. J. Maitland.]\n\nThe valley is about half a mile broad and well there is no town or even central agglomeration ly small villages scattered up and down the he north is a fairly continuous wall of cliffs out 300 feet in height; to the south is a central ated by the glens called Dahaneh-i-T\u00e1jik and idabad from the cliffs limiting the western and of the valley. On the edge of the central small, conical, clayey hill, covered with the \u017eulah. This is probably the ancient Bamian.\n\ne everywhere pierced with numerous caves, but umber is found on the north side of the valley, also the famous idols, the B\u00fat-i-Bamian. The ese are literally honeycombed with caves, which i in the d\u00e9bris slope at the bottom. They are abited by Tajiks, or used as store-rooms, and frequently protected by a low mud wall.\n\ncliff the larger of the two big idols is to the to the right. They are about a quarter of a l supposed to be male and female, and their pectively 180 and 120 feet. Their names are, r former travellers, Sal S\u00e1l for the male and for the female figure. The idols are standing red in very bold relief in deep niches. Between dols are, or rather were, two smaller ones, also ese are equidistant from the large idols and\nfrom each other, that is to say, there is about 150 yards between each of the niches, large and small. One of the smaller niches is about 60 to 70 feet high, and is now empty, though a close inspection shows fragments of the idol that once filled it. The second small niche is still occupied by a sitting figure, which is about 40 feet high and known as the Bacheh, or child. The general shape of the niches is the same in all cases, but that of the large female figure is evidently unfinished, and the shoulders are not marked, nor the edges smoothed off.\n\nThe depth of the niches of the two large idols is about twice the thickness of the figures standing in them: the latter are therefore fairly well protected from the weather, and this accounts for their excellent preservation, nearly all the damage done to them being due to the hand of man. The whole interior of the niches, and particularly the arches over the heads of the idols, have been painted with what appears to be allegorical designs. Although much damaged, in fact, obliterated, where they could be easily got at, enough remains to show the general style of the work, which is exceedingly well executed, and forcibly reminds one of what is generally understood to be Byzantine art.\n\nThe idols themselves are rather clumsy figures, roughly hewn in the tough conglomerate rock, and afterwards thickly overlaid with stucco, in which all the details are executed. The whole arrangement clearly shows that this was not done at a later period, but is part of the original design of the figures. The stucco appears to have been painted, or at least paint was used in some places. The features of the figures have been purposely destroyed, and the legs of the larger one have been partly knocked away, it is said by cannon-shot fired at it by Nadir Shah. Both idols are draped in garments reaching to below the knee. The limbs and contour of the body show through, and the general effect of muslin is excellently imitated in the stucco. The arms of both are bent at the elbow, the forearms and the hands projecting, but the latter are now broken off. The feet have also been battered out of shape.\nNarrow stairways hewn in the interior of the rock lead up from cave to cave to the heads of the idols, and even to the summit of the hill.\n\nThe caves, though so numerous, are not large. By far the greater portion of them are chambers 12 to 14 feet square, with domed roofs. I think as a rule several chambers open into each other, and have a wide portico in front by which light is admitted to the doorways. These have generally round arches. There are certainly no pointed arches anywhere, but some of the openings may be square-headed. The domes are set on the four-sided chambers in a remarkable manner, the square being reduced to an octagon by cornices springing by tiers from the angles in unmistakeable imitation of brick-work. (See Plate X., also Plate I. Figs. 17, 18 and 19.) It is a very curious fact that at Kandahar domes are to this day commonly built on brick-built square chambers in exactly the same fashion. One of the roofs seen was of a different kind, flat and divided into four by deep wide cuts, crossing each other in the centre. Small cupolas were hewn in the centre of each of the spaces and at the intersection of the cuts. The largest cave of all is said to be between the feet of the great idol, but like several others it is used for government stores, and was filled with lucerne, etc. We saw no Vihara caves, but some are said to exist. As above mentioned, the majority of the caves are inhabited. A few years ago it is said they all were. The interiors are plain, without sculptural ornamentation, and now completely smoke-blackened. The whole, however, were plastered with stucco and painted. In one of the upper caves, near the head of the female idol, some designs are still visible.\n\nA short distance east of the female idol, near the foot of the cliff, is a mound, which seems to be the remains of a Buddhist tope.\n\nA design on the arch over the female idol can, to a certain extent, be made out with a field-glass. Within a circle is a figure in a long robe with a spear, apparently slaying something. The two upper corners without the circle are filled\nwith figures of angels or cherubs, waving scarves at each other. They might well date from the last century. On either side is a border with male and female busts or half-figures in circles, and all adorned with halos. Outside the central design on the left-hand side is a very curious figure of a human-headed bird.\n\nOn the east side of the Saidabad glen is an idol, which does not appear to have been noticed by former travellers. It is somewhere up the cliff, which is pierced with numerous caves. The niche is 40 to 60 feet high, and the figure in it has its head covered with a sort of cap or tiara. The two big idols may possibly have been adorned in like manner; the top of their heads is now unnaturally flat, suggesting the idea that something has been cut off.\n\nIt should be mentioned that the caves are very dark, only a small doorway admits light, and without candles, or rather good lanterns, nothing can be seen. The stairways are always very narrow and steep. There is almost invariably a shallow recess opposite the doorway. No traces of doors were seen.\n\nNote.\u2014These letters have been following one another at intervals during the last two or three months, and this latest communication from Captain Maitland it was necessary to give at the last moment, as it becomes the text to his own sketches; more particularly as it adds to our scant knowledge of Bamian. With the letters Captain Maitland has sent drawings of the peculiar roof partially described by Captain Talbot (see p. 326), and these make the form of the roof now perfectly clear; but it is a form quite new to us, and as yet I would not venture on an opinion as to its origin. When Captain Maitland speaks of the \"male\" and the \"female\" in relation to the two large statues, it should be understood that he is only using these terms as they have long been applied to them by the natives of the locality. We have the authority of Hiuen Tsiang that the smaller figure, the so-called \"female idol,\" was Buddha, and Captain Maitland's drawing of it perfectly confirms this. The statement that the stairs lead up to the summit of the cliff becomes a slight confirmation of my guess that the mounds on the summit are the remains of Stupas.\u2014W.S.\nThe Sumerian Language and its Affinities. By Fritz Hommel, of Munich. Communicated by Mr. Hon. Member R.A.S.\n\nAmong languages of the world, Sumerian may be regarded as the oldest. We possess now a fragment of the ancient Chaldean King Ur-ganna of which are of an even earlier date than the time of the mythical Egyptian King Menes. Our sources of knowledge of this language\u2014the language of the Babylonian civilization\u2014are twofold, namely: inscriptions of bilingual incantations, hymns, psalms, etc., and late copies, giving the original text, line for line, with a Semitic (Babylonian or Assyrian) translation; also many inscriptions, in Sumerian only, of the early kings, some very short, but some of considerable length, as a rule, full of still puzzling and obscure, as well as difficult grammatical forms. They sometimes confirm many points of grammar, while bilingual texts, which themselves necessarily form a big-point of our grammatical and philological studies of this language, and which are so numerous, enable us to gain from them alone a clear and nearly complete picture of the very interesting idiom in which they are written. Of great help also in our investigations are the cuneiform and grammatical tablets of the Assyrian kings, however, being simply compilations made when the language had ceased to exist, must be somewhat cautious.\n\nWe therefore the roots, forms, and syntax of the Sumerian and Semitic tongues, that, at the very outset, such scholars as Sir H. C. Rawlinson, Dr. Hincks, and\nothers thought it to be more or less connected with the so-called Turanian languages. The term Turanian comprising, as it does, two great groups of cognate\u2014though only loosely cognate\u2014languages, namely, the Ugro-Finnic (Uralic) and the Mongolian-Turco-Tartaric (Altaic) families, was, however, too vague. It was with the first-named group that the late F. Lenormant declared the Sumerian to have the closest connection. Since the rejection of this theory of Lenormant in 1881 by Dr. Donner, the eminent Ugro-Finnish scholar, the question seemed to be set at rest, at least with regard to the Ugro-Finnish group of languages; but it really opened afresh the question of the true position of Sumerian among the languages of the world.\n\nIn the following pages I shall try to show that this important question can be fully settled. That branch of the Turanian family, which geographically was the nearest neighbour of the Old Sumerians, the Turko-Tatars, with the Mongols, was also linguistically nearest akin. This fact will be fully proved by phonology, grammar, syntax and dictionary.\n\nWith regard to phonology and dictionary, we must start from the development found in the texts themselves. Beside the Old Sumerian (the contemporaneous inscriptions of kings, and the bilingual incantations), we possess, also, later texts, which seemed at the first glance to be intermixed with dialectical forms (Sayce, Lenormant, Pinches, Haupt); these are, however, as I have in my latest works pointed out, in reality, Neo-Sumerian. Professor Haupt, who found out, after Sayce, Lenormant and Pinches, but as I am now convinced, quite independently, this difference in the lexicographical lists and then in the texts, was the first to treat of them, and gave the principal facts in a little paper published in the G\u00f6ttinger Gel. Anzeigen. He was, however, wrong in thinking the Old Sumerian forms (Dr. Haupt\u2019s Accadian) to be the later ones, and the Neo-Sumerian (by him called dialectic, or Sumerian absolutely) the earliest stage of the language; the great step forward which he made in our knowledge of Sumerian on the one\nbeside *bis* 'we,' and other examples,\u00b9 are to be quoted form *kep*, beside *gib* and *gim* (in the languages, especially those of Southern Siberia), widening of the two tenues *g* and *b*, leads us to an observation for the phonology of Sumerian\u2014I widening of *g*, *b*, *d* and *z* into *k*, *p*, *t* and *s*, not the writing (for here the historical old forms lies were kept), but shown by a great many ed from Sumerian, in the Semitic Babylonian *gus* 'throne, seat,' became with the Semites *Kutu* (the biblical Kutha), *Agadi Akkadu* (the ; *Zimbir sippar*, *zabar* 'brass' *siparru*; *asag* t; *madda* 'land' *matu*, etc. For the Turkish y also be compared the following instances: *wo* 'iki(s), gug 'sheep' *koyun*, *gas* (Neo-Sum. *hi* (also *kech-ki* and *ech-ki* occur), *dingir* 'God' father' *ata*, *gis* 'man' *ki\u0161i*, *bar* 'to be bright' 'to touch' *tek-mek*, *gin* 'straight, right' *k\u00fcni*, . *gu*, Neo-Sum. *rush-in*) 'bird' *kush*, *bad* 'to withdraw' *batar* 'west, sunset,' *dugun* (Neo-mail of the finger, claw, hoof,' *toyn-ak*, etc.\n\ning seems to have taken place in all cases alterations of the above-named four consonants ly:\n\n(written *b* or *m*), *y*, and, lastly, to *sh* and to *d* rather a alternation of two different sound not a natural change)\u2014instead of *g* to *k*; weak Engl. *th*), *z* and further *s*\u2014instead of\n\n*r* (so-called rhotacism)\u2014instead of *z* to *s*; *r* to *t*, or else to a mere spiritus lenis.\n\nages, that of *g* to *r*, of *g* (also *k*) to *sh*, and *d* net with in Neo-Sumerian, the rest existed\n\ninfounded with this, if even in the Oldest Sumerian we find suffix *mun* beside *ban* (from the pronominal stem of the 3rd have here the same law of sound as in the Turkish *mun-de* ), comp.

T\u00fcrksprachen, p. 160,\n'down,' nim-gir instead of nam-gir 'lightning,' ush-bu 'his persecutor' (for ush-bi), mun-du-tutuddi 'he enters' (for mun-da-tutuddi), etc. etc. In most cases, however, the historical old form is written, though in speaking the vowels were assimilated, as this must be concluded by the mere existence of the above-quoted forms.\n\nThe original consonants are k, g, \u0163 or gh, t, d, b, m, n, z, s, \u0161, r, l; but k and t are only found at the beginning of the word or syllable, at least in Old Sumerian, and here very rarely, as most of the independent roots with these initial consonants begin with the so-called tenuis. There must have existed, even in older Sumerian, besides these, a consonantal y (indicated only by a following i instead of a) for an original r, n, l or g, e.g. gal-t, i.e. gayi, for galla 'great,' in-t, i.e. iyi, for inna or inni 'lord,' etc.; then ng (only after a vowel), e.g. dingir 'God' (comp. tengri), kingi-n, kingi 'land' (from the words din 'spirit' and kin), and v (between two vowels) for original b, e.g. in the proper name Ur-Ba'u 'man of the goddess Ba'u or Bohu,' followed by the genitive-postposition -gi, Ur-Ba-bi-gi, of course spoken Ur-Bavi-gi.\n\nIn Neo-Sumerian, this pronunciation of b as v seems to have become quite general, as also that of m as v, and is at the same time the reason why m and b are so often confounded in the writing of the hymns and psalms. The same must have been the case, at a certain period, in the Turkish languages, for it is only by this law that such forms as gib, beside gim (also kep) 'like' (orig. 'to form, to model'), moi (so in Yakute) beside buyu-n\n\n1 Also in the Turkish family of languages we find this tendency to change l in y, e.g. yuy-mak 'to wash' (comp. Sum. tug), gayy-mak 'to spread out, to foot' (comp. Sum. lal 'to hang up, to spread out, to put down'). As for r and n to y, these two sounds became, of course, at first l before they became y, for which change (r to l, and n to l) we have numerous analogies already in Older Sumerian, still more in Neo-Sumerian and in Turkish; comp. Sum. gir 'foot,' Mong. gul; Sum. ur 'foundation,' Turk. ul; Sum. shur 'to cry,' Turk. s\u014dy-le-mek 'to speak'; Sum. dur, dir 'full,' Turk. dolu; Sum. bar 'side, heart,' Turk. bel 'loins, midst'; Sum. nigin 'circle, to collect, assemble,' Turk. yigil, iyil 'to assemble, to go round about'; Sum. gun 'neck,' Turk. buy-un; ansu 'ass,' Mong. els\u0131-gen (Turk. ehr-k); nin 'four,' Chagat. nil-au 'the fourth'; Mong. nogai, nochot 'dog,' Neo-Sum. tug, lig, etc. etc.\n'The Sumerian Language and Its Affinities'\n\n'neck,' *mis* beside *bis* 'we,' and other examples,\u00b9 are explained.\n\nThe above-quoted form *kep*, beside *git* and *gim* in Turkish languages, especially those of Southern S, which is a hardening of the two tenues *g* and *b*, leads us to an important observation for the phonology of Sumerian: mean the hardening of *g*, *b*, *d* and *s* into *k*, *p*, *t* and *s* expressed by the writing (for here the historical old forms with the tenues were kept), but shown by a great number of words, borrowed from Sumerian, in the Semitic Babylonian language.

The transition \\( r \\) to \\( l \\) to \\( d \\) is very common already in Older Sumerian.\ng) For b to v or spiritus lenis: bad \u2018to name\u2019 (N pad), Turk. at \u2018name\u2019; ubur \u2018bosom, breast,\u2019 Ti \u2018nurse\u2019 (i.e. breast-giving), Tung. uiur \u2018bosom, ob\u00fcr, \u00f6ber, and Magyar \u00f6b\u00f6l the same, comp. also optative, for which we find sometimes a-, the middle form being va-, etc.\n\nOne remarkable sound-law, of which traces are a in the Turkish languages,\u2014namely, the change of n two vowels to ng, and lastly (in Neo-Sumerian) t still to be noticed, e.g. din \u2018spirit,\u2019 ding-ir \u2018God\u2019 Mong. tengri), Neo-Sum. dimir; inna-gar \u2018he makes,\u2019 imma-gar; kin \u2018land,\u2019 kingi-n \u2018land,\u2019 Neo-Sum. sh \u0161umir; for these comp. the Turk. domuz \u2018pig, the older dunguz. Other Turkish words seem to same formation as in kungur \u2018yellow-brown,\u2019 shin tress,\u2019 etc. In closest connexion with this change is namely, that n after a vowel, especially at the er word or root, becomes m, even in Older Sumerian, l commonly in Neo-Sumerian, e.g. alan \u2018statue,\u2019 alam; sun \u2018to give,\u2019 already in Older Sumer. su. \u2018mother\u2019 (Turk. ana), Neo-Sum. amma, am (comp. em\u00e4); kan \u2018gate,\u2019 later kam, kav (comp. Turk. kapu kan, kam (in nu-kamma) \u2018priest, sorcerer,\u2019 Turk. kam (our Germ. \u2018Schamane\u2019); \u0161isin \u2018seven,\u2019 still pres Ural. sisem; comp. also the Turkish nominal-s (e.g. tarim \u2018cultivated\u2019 from tari-mak) besides common -n, etc., etc.\n\nBefore we go on to the various forms of the grammar and their coincidences with those of the languages, we must remark, that the numerous given above in the treatment of the phonology themselves be sufficient to prove a close relationship the two idioms Sumerian and Turko-Mongolian. now see how far the rules we have laid down in t the phonology and dictionary are confirmed by the of the two languages.\n\nWe are quite right if we say, that in Sumerian \u2018 called sag, \u2018good\u2019 dug, \u2018great\u2019 gal, \u2018to make\u2019 ga\u0131\ntheoretically. But if these words\u2014as mostly happens\u2014be used independently, they are always written and spoken with a following \\(a\\), the so-called state of prolongation, e.g. sagga, dugga, galla, garra; but in composition, and if the verbs have subject- and object-prefixes before them, the original root-form comes to light, e.g. sag-gigga \u2018head-ache,\u2019 ur-dugga \u2018a good man\u2019 (from urru \u2018man\u2019), in-gar \u2018he made\u2019 (but, if alone, then always garra \u2018he made\u2019; in-garra, opposite to in-gar, is \u2018he makes (now)\u2019). In the Turkish languages we find still traces of this peculiar fuller form of words, not only in some of the oldest and most common nouns, e.g. giche \u2018night\u2019 (Sum. gig), ata \u2018father\u2019 (Sum. adda), ana \u2018mother\u2019 (Sum. anna), ki\u0161i \u2018man\u2019 (Sum. gi\u0161), kuni \u2018straight, upright, right\u2019 (Sum. ginna or ginni), etc., but also in the vocative (comp. Vambery, Uigurische Sprachmonumente, p. 37), and especially in the so-called gerundive of the Eastern and Siberian Turkish idioms, preserved in Western Turkish even now before the endings of conjugation.\n\nConcerning the formation of nouns and adjectives by external elements, we have a prefixed vowel in one case only. It is a repetition of the root-vowel, but was originally, as it seems, an \\(a\\), e.g. bur \u2018vessel,\u2019 ubur \u2018breast, bosom\u2019 (Turk. obur the same); nim \u2018to be high,\u2019 niim \u2018high,\u2019 and many other instances. That we have (beside the above-quoted ubur) still traces of this formation in the Turanian languages, esp. before \\(r\\), e.g. irak beside rak \u2018wide\u2019 (comp. Sum. rag the same), but also in other cases, the late Fran\u00e7. Lenormant has already shown. Further research will, I am convinced, find out many more instances in the Altaic idioms, though those already quoted are sufficient to show the striking coincidence. Beside this prefixed vowel, we have still some substantives and pronouns, forming, with a noun or adjective, abstracts (so ki \u2018place,\u2019 nan or nam \u2018destiny, thing\u2019) or agent nouns (nomina agentis, so nin \u2018what,\u2019 Neo-Sum. yim, im, and nu, Neo-Sum. lu \u2018somebody,\u2019 orig. \u2018man\u2019), e.g. ki-agga\n\n1 Words having \\(u\\) or \\(i\\) as root-vowel often take, in the state of prolongation, the same vowel instead of the usual \\(a\\) (vowel harmony); for such forms as gar-i (gayi) for garra, sag-i (sayi) for sagga, see above, p. 354.\n'love' from ag 'to love,' nam-tilla 'life' from til, ti 'n\u00edn-gulla 'hostile' from gul 'to be hostile,' h 'sorcerer' from kam 'to bespeak,' etc. That these real prefixes (which would be contradictory to the theory of the agglutinative character of the Sumerian and the Turanian family) will easily be seen from their meaning (e.g. 'place of loving,' 'destiny of living,' ever is hostile,' 'whoever is bespeaking'). The only thing is the position of the genitive and adjective after noun, so common in Sumerian, even in the oldest but when the Sumerian says urra-anna 'servant of,' this is an abbreviation of urra-ann\u00e1-gi (with the postposition Turkish -ing), and when he says dingir-gal-gallini dingirra-galli-la! = god + doubled adjective + plural + postposition, i.e. 'from the great gods,' it is quite a way of putting the adjective, as e.g. in the Semitic rab\u00fati; comp. also ur-gall\u00e1-ba-ku 'to its great four place' with Semitic ana \u00f1idi-\u0161u rabi.\n\nReal suffixes however are -gal (Neo-Sum. -cal, -cal 'being') and -tug, -tu (Neo-Sum. -ti), orig. 'possession,' gul-gal 'hostile,' a-tug (from a 'might, power') 'ruler,' etc.; comp. the endings -ul (e.g. kara-ul 'watchman'), -mak (e.g. kabor-ti 'sedition, trouble') in Eastern Turk kara-mak 'to look' and kabor-mak 'to make a noise.'\n\nOther suffixes are the inseparable endings -g (Neo-Sum. -k), -n (sometimes -m), -r (sometimes -l) and -\u0161, with so many roots are compounded, e.g. dini-g 'might' (beside ud) 'sun,' bala-g 'hatchet,' \u0161ili-g 'leader,' anna-biri-g (Semitic gunnu\u0161u), Illa-g and Karra-g, names of etc.; sagi-n 'bright' (from zag), timi-n 'foundation tim, li), sunnu-n 'old,' giri-n 'fruit,' nig\u00ed-n 'circle,' ama-r 'young bull' (from am 'ox'), zag\u00e1r 'bright' (Sum. zabar, from zag), aga-r 'field' (from ag 'to dingi-r 'God' (from din 'spirit'), gubu-r 'low land, (Semitic kinnatu), etc.; ama\u0161 'hurdle for cattle' (from 'ox'), gur\u0161 'high' (from gur 'to elevate'), sigi-\u0161 'a libation' (from sig, si 'to pour out,' perhaps a Neo-Sumerian formation from diri-g 'full,' which\nbecame *gig*, *gi*; as *gig* could become *gigis*, *gis*, *gara-s*\n'snow' from *gir* 'to build', *gi* 'eye' Turk. *gir*, *sana-s*,\n*gir* and some others. Now, the same elements are\nfound to form the nouns in the Turk languages, e.g. *bili-k*\n'knowledge' from *bil* 'to know', *kula-k* 'lip' (comp.\nNeo-Sum. *ku* 'great' from *k* 'great' comp. Sum. *gal*,\nNeo-Sum. *ku* 'ass' from *ku* 'the ass', comp. Sum.\nand Ming. *kili* 'bright' comp. Sum. *gar*\n'to be bright', etc.; *tak-s* 'them' from *tak* 'to sew,\nto fix', *kis* 'will ass' from *kis* 'reddish dun', *koyn-a*\n'sheep' Ming. *koyan* comp. Sum. *ko*, Neo-Sum. *udub*,\netc.; *nag* 'aged' from *n* 'age', *tura-r* 'iron',\n*tur* 'copper', *chup* 'a pit, a depression', *puy-r* 'itch',\nMing. *chup* 'day' Sum. *chup*, *Ug.* *r* 'time', as also\nsome nouns and adj. in -u, -u, e.g. *gul* 'green',\n*ku* 'red', etc.; *gul* 'snow', *gul* 'a sigh' from *gul-mak*\n'a sigh', *gul* 'earnings', *gul* from *gul* 'to find', as\nalso some words ending in -u, -u, e.g. *chup* 'cook', *wiy-s*\n'pest', etc.\n\nThe pronouns of the 1st and 2nd person were in Sumerian\noriginally *u* and *u*, as is seen from the writing *u* and\n*u* pronounced *u* and *u*. comp. Turkish *u* and *u*;\nthe pronouns for the 3rd person are *u* 'he', plural *u* and *u*,\nboth used absolutely, and *u* 'this' in connection\nwith substantives. *u* 'he', *u* the Turkish *-i* in *-ing-i*\n'the mine', lit. I-of-that, i.e. that of mine is very seldom\nused in Sumerian. The possessive suffixes are *u* 'my', *u*\n'his', *u* 'this', *u* 'that', *u* only as subject prefix\nfor *u* verbs. Now we have in the Turkish exactly the\nsame distribution of pronominal stems:\n\n*u* for the 1st, *u* for the 2nd, *u* and *u* or *u* for the 3rd\nperson; compare ol, gen. an-ung 'he' absolutely, ol (as adjective, comp. in Sum. -ni 'his,' but -bi 'this,' and -si 'his' as suffix after vowel stems before consonant stems. Very remarkable, also, is that in Sumerian, as in Turki, every pronoun-stem strengthened by n, e.g. ma-n 'I,' za-n 'thou,' na-n (later si) 'he,' nin (later ni) 'he,' ba-n (later mi) (accusative only and in most cases neuter), ra-n (out of za-n (za-b) 'thee,' as is also the case with stem elements ta, da, ra, which occur usually in forms tan-, dan-, -ran (later tab, dab, rab), e.g. ba '(he) it brings out' and ba-ran-uddu, ib-tan-gar (ib-(a-gar), etc. etc.\n\nThe interrogative pronouns are aba 'who' (probable aga) and mi'a, ana 'what,' the indefinite nami 'some' 'somewhat, anything'; comp. Turki ne (Osm. ne) kim 'who' (from ki-me, comp. nime beside ne), nime neme-r-se 'what it may be' (neme+er-se, the latter 'it').\n\nThe Numerals have already been referred to when discussing the phonology, and they would alone be sufficient to prove the closest relationship of Sumerian with Turkish. They are, shortly repeated, gi\u0161 (bir) one, as also a\u0161 in Uig. a\u0161-ni 'at first'); ga\u0161 (ikir) two, as also (out of gu\u0161), is (Turk. cis, \u00fcch) three; nis (Chagatai Neo-Sum. \u0161im, \u0161ub four; ia as also ra\u0161 (be\u0161) five; i\u0161a\u0161, six; \u0161i\u0161in (Ugr. si\u0161em) as also \u0161imin seven; u\u0161a (ou\u0161) eight; \u0161i\u0161imu (out of ia+Neo-Sum. \u0161im) nine; Neo-Sum. cun, un (Turki con, on) ten; min, mi (L hundred.\n\nAs it seems: object-subject-verb, e.g. ia-nan-gar, in-nab-gar (with the subject-prefix; in-gar 'it made'). We find also inman immagar), immagar (out of immi-gar), an-gar and al-gar, bar-gar, ba-naggar, ba-mub-gar and other variants. As for the strange min-made, we have here the same law of sound as in Turkish (comp. above, I, for it is for ban-gar (as in Turkish minum-ki 'this here,' mun-da 'here, this,' for bun-, and this for older ban). It is only with the pronoun person before the verb that we have the order: subj.+ obj. -mu-ren-sum 'he gives to thee,' forms, which are apparently of later origin from mu (out of mu-n, and this for be-n), otherwise and originally 'it' (accusative), but here for 'he' (nominative); the same order we have in min-aggar 'he them sent out.'\nThe same is the case with the verb (oldest forms: garra \u2018he made,\u2019 garr\u0101-mu \u2018I made,\u2019 garr\u0101-zu \u2018thou madest,\u2019 garrini \u2018they make,\u2019 garrissh \u2018they made\u2019), comp. especially p. 360, note 4, and other places above (in treating the pronouns). We have here only to add, that the precative or optative prefix \u0123i- is just the same as the optative suffix in Turki, comp. \u0123i-gal (Neo-Sum. -ral) \u2018he may be\u2019 with Turki bol-\u011fai (Osm. ol\u0101), that the prefixed stem-forming elements ta, da, ra, prefixed to the verb in Sumerian, occur in Turki alone (e.g. kol-da-mak from kol \u2018arm,\u2019 k\u00f6te-r-mek from the root k\u014dt, ari-t-mak \u2018to let make clean\u2019 from ari-mak \u2018to make clean\u2019) as also combined in tir, tur, e.g. kil-t\u00fcr-mek \u2018to bring\u2019 from kil-mek \u2018to come,\u2019 that also the Turki reflexive stem with n (e.g. taula-n-mak \u2018to become fat\u2019 from taula-mak \u2018to make fat\u2019) has its analogy in Sumerian (comp. garinn\u0101-su \u2018thou hast been,\u2019 Sem. tab\u0161il, from gar \u2018to make\u2019), that forms like aggi\u0161 (not plural!) \u2018he sent out\u2019 (from a verb ag) are the prototype for the Turki reciprocal stem with s, e.g. sor-u\u0161-mak \u2018to ask one together\u2019 from sor-mak \u2018to ask.\u2019\n\nWhere we and the Semites have prepositions, the Sumerian has, like the Turkish idioms, postpositions, of which the most common are: -ku (Neo-Sum. \u0161u) \u2018to,\u2019 -gi (Neo-Sum. also -di) \u2018of,\u2019 ka \u2018of\u2019 (but originally for the dative, as is shown by M. Amiaud\u2019s ingenious remarks on the difference of -ka and -gi), -ra and -ru \u2018to,\u2019 -ta \u2018in, out of,\u2019 -da \u2018with, for,\u2019 -gim (also gimmi, Neo-Sum. -dim) \u2018like.\u2019 Compare the Turki genitive -ing (for -igi, -ingi), the old dative -ra and -ru (Vambery, Cag. Sprachstudien, p. 20), the common dative in -ka, -ga, the Turki ta, da, \u2018in\u2019 and tan, dan, \u2018out of\u2019 and lastly gibi, kimi \u2018like.\u2019\n\nIn addition I should like to remark that of negative particles in Sumerian there existed two, the most common nu \u2018not\u2019 (before verbs also na, e.g. nan-gar \u2018he did not make\u2019), the other ba, this latter only before verbs, and here, as it seems, in a prohibitive sense, e.g. baran-gar as also ban-gar \u2018he may not do.\u2019\u00b9 Now we have in Turki the\n\n\u00b9 The discovery of ban-gar in this sense belongs to Dr. Zimmern.\nparticle ne-ne 'neither\u2014nor,' and besides it, but only position with verbs, ma, e.g. sev-mek 'to love,' sev-me-ni to love.' The Sumerian ana 'what' bears the same relationship to the negation nu or na (comp. also Turki ne and ne negative particle) as the Arabic md 'what' secondary md 'not.'\n\nIn conclusion, to meet any objections that may be raised as to the difference of order in the verbal particles which are prefixed in Sumerian, but suffixed in the Turki languages, it must be remembered that there are no less than a thousand years' interval between the latest Sumerian and the oldest Turki document (the Uigurian Kudatkhana, circa 1050 A.D.), and if, between the earliest and the latest Sumerian texts, such changes in the syntax could take place as e.g. garra-bi 'he made,' instead of Old Sum. gara-in-gar, an-gar, sin-gar, etc., or idi bar-mun-sib for igi bar, lit. 'eye giving to him' (from igi, Neo-Sum. id and bar 'to give'), it must be admitted that the possibility of the verbal particles at the end instead of the beginning change not only possible but even to be expected.\n\nIn the foregoing pages I have confined myself primarily to giving all the newest results of my researches about the position of Sumerian amongst the languages of the world.\n\n1 Those who interest themselves in this subject will find much information with regard to Sumerian grammar and its affinities with the Turki languages in the author's paper \"Die sumero-akkadische Sprache und ihre Verwandtschaftsverh\u00e4ltnisse,\" in the \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Keilschriften und Kunde der Orient,\" vol. i.

Discussing the origin of the object known as the\ntr\u012bkula\\(^1\\) he said, \"It is curiously like the sign of the planet\nMercury, or the caduceus of the god of that name; and, if\nit were not rank heresy even to hint at such a thing, I\nwould venture to suggest that, after all, there may be some\nconnexion between at least the symbolism of the East and\nWest.\" And later on in the same work the author records\nthe following opinion, in a note on an old Buddhist legend\nwhich mentions a Prince of \"R\u014dm,\"\\(^2\\) \"It would be absurd\nto found any serious theory on the mention of the name of\nRome if it stood alone and unsupported. The circumstance\nmentioned in the narrative of the strangers being white men\nand coming by sea is a small confirmation that the people\nhere mentioned were really Europeans. My impression,\nhowever, is that few who are familiar with the arts of Rome\nin Constantine's time, and who will take the trouble to master\nthese Amar\u0101vati sculptures, can fail to perceive many points\nof affinity between them . . . . The conviction the study\nof these sculptures has forced on my mind is that there was\nmuch more intercommunication between the east and west\nduring the whole period from Alexander to Justinian than\n\n\\(^1\\) Op. cit. pp. 115, 116, and note.\n\\(^2\\) Id. p. 177, note 3.\nEARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM.\n\nis frequently supposed, and that the intercourse was\nally frequent and influential in the middle period, by\nAugustus and Constantine.\"\n\nMy attention has for some time been given to this subject,\nbut residence in India, inability to consult proper works\nreference, and press of official work have hitherto prevented\nmy preparing any paper regarding it. Continued study,\nhowever, not shaken my belief in Fergusson's accuracy,\nI hope to be able now to show some reasonable foundation\nfor the theory that most of the early Buddhist symbols,\nwhose origin is not directly traceable to indigenous\nsources, may have been derived from earlier pre-\nWestern Asian forms, introduced into India during\ncenturies that elapsed between the Aryan immigrations\nthither and the first construction in stone of places\nBuddhist worship.\n\nThe first point to which attention must be called is\npolitical connexion between India and the countries\nWestern Asia during the period in question.\n\nVery little has yet been learned from Indian sources\nthe early history of India before the time of Chandragupta\n(B.C. 319). But it seems certain that the country, formerly\npopulated by Turanian hordes, was overswept by Aryan\nmigrations which brought into India the religion of\nVedas, and, partly by force of arms, partly by the power\nof priestcraft, ousted the Turanians from civil and religious\ngovernment. The Aryans, however, powerful though\nthey may have been, never succeeded in crushing out\nTuranian religious beliefs and superstitions. Down to\nthe time of \u015a\u0101ky\u0101 Muni, though the Vedas may represent\nthe views of the more elevated and civilized few, fetichism, demons\n\u2014or rather the fear of demons, leading to demon propitiation\u2014\na rooted belief in the existence of snake-deities, fairies,\ngoblins, and in the power of mystic incantations and\ncharms had, as it has to this day, firm hold of the ignorant\nlethargic masses. Had pure Vedism been the faith of\nthe people, there would have been little need for a Buddhi\nThe era of Chandragupta may be regarded as identical with the era of Alexander for present purposes. Professor Rawlinson has shortly summed up in the following words the condition in pre-Alexandrian times of Western Asia, of the country, that is, bordering on India:\u00b9\u2014\"For nearly a thousand years, from the formation of the great Assyrian Empire to the death of Darius Codomannus (330 B.C.), Western Asia, from the Mediterranean to Afghanistan, or even to India, had been united under one head, and acknowledged one sovereign. Assyria, Media, Persia, had successively held the position of dominant power.\" Alexander broke up this unity, and the effect of his schemes was \"to introduce in the place of a single consolidated empire, a multitude of separate and contending kingdoms.\" The kingdom of Chandragupta in India was one of these. Previous to his date, during the period when Western Asia was united under the successive empires, the whole of what we now call Hindustan was divided amongst a number of petty chieftains, mostly at enmity with one another, and probably looking on the vast empire on their immediate west as all-powerful. Is it not possible, or rather, is it not probable, that during this period the inhabitants of India had been drinking in the ideas and superstitions of their great neighbours? It is certain that Northern India had, before the time of Alexander, been subject to more than one invasion from the West; and if there were any commercial activity at all, it is quite possible that the Hindus of that date had in their midst colonies of foreign traders\u2014traders glorying in the fancied possession of superior civilization, and proud of the political ascendency of their nation and sovereign. If there were no commercial activity, how is that the Vai\u015byas, or merchant-class, came to hold such an important position as they undoubtedly did in the body politic of a Hindu State?\n\nSetting aside the mythical invasions of India by the Assyrian Semiramis, and Diodorus's problematical account\n\n\u00b9 *Sixth Great Oriental Monarchy*, p. 29.\nof the expedition of Sesostris\u2014both of which accounts, however, point to the existence of a belief among the Greeks that India was a country that had lain open and had suffered from invasions long anterior to those of Darius Hystaspis, and serve to show that the Greeks at least, did not consider such a state of things as improbable, whatever may be the opinion of writers of the present day,\u2014we have evidence that in very early days there was an interchange of commercial relations between Western Asia and India. Dr. Burnell holds it as not to be doubted that India even traded with Egypt in very early times. But there is no necessity for present purposes to go farther than Asia.\n\nSir Henry Rawlinson has pointed out that the Chaldaean inscriptions make frequent mention of the \"ships of Ur,\" and imply that they navigated to considerable distances. It is not improbable that these ships carried goods from India. Gold could be obtained from both Africa and India, and it was lavishly used in decoration. The Phoenicians also traded with India by sea. Prof. Rawlinson points out that for ten centuries prior to the reign of Seleukos Nikator, from a date, that is, as early as the beginning of Assyrian ascendancy, the precious stones and the most valuable kinds of merchandise had been coming from every quarter into the region governed by the monarch. Gold, tin, silks, pearls, spices, and other articles of commerce, had been passing into it from India since the foundation of the first Assyrian empire in the fourth century B.C. Whatever may have been the exact date of the Homeric poems, it has been repeatedly noticed that the Greek bards were acquainted with tin and other articles of Indian merchandize, and called them by their Sanskrit names, and that the Hebrew chroniclers of King Solomon and of the reign of Hiram of Tyre used Indian names for Indian products.\n\n1 Burnell's South-Indian Palaeography, p. 3.\n2 Rawlinson's Ancient Monarchies, vol. i. p. 101-2.\n3 Sixth Oriental Monarchy, p. 33.\nThat gold was largely exported from India in very early days has been inferred from a number of corroborative facts. MM. Perrot and Chipiez\\(^1\\) write: \"From objects found in the excavations, from inscriptions in which the Assyrians boast of their wealth and prodigality, from Egyptian texts in which the details of tribute paid by the Roten-nou, that is, by the people of Syria and Mesopotamia, are given, it is clear that in the great days of Nineveh and Babylon, those capitals possessed a vast quantity of gold, and employed it in a host of different ways. . . . . . These accumulations were continually added to, in the case of Babylon, by the active commerce she carried on with the mineral-producing countries, such as the Caucasus, Bactriana, India, and Egypt.\"\n\nThe period of Solomon, or say 1000 B.C., is generally considered to have been one of great commercial activity, but it seems unreasonable to assume that that monarch largely increased the trade of the world. We are induced to lay more stress than is perhaps warranted on the commerce of Solomon's date, on account of the high position he holds in the Jewish Scriptures. It is probable that the trade which glorified his age had been carried on with similar briskness by his neighbours for some centuries past. The period of Solomon is one that witnessed the decadence of the great Assyrian Empire, and a corresponding rise to a state of prosperity of the hitherto obscure Jewish nation. This ascendancy was, however, very short-lived. Solomon, so it would seem, carried on by the aid of the Phoenicians and with considerable success the old-established eastern commerce. There is little reason to think that he originated or greatly increased, during his very short spell of domination, a commerce which had been non-existent or scanty in previous years.\n\nFrom the days of Solomon we must pass to those of the second Tiglath-Pileser of Assyria, of Shalmanezer IV., and of Sargon, the same that carried captive the Ten Israelitish tribes, removed them to the cities of \"Halah and Habor on\n\n\\(^1\\) History of Art in Chaldea and Assyria, Armstrong's translation, vol. i. p. 125.\nthe river of Gozan and into the cities of the Med placed Assyrians and Chaldaeans in the cities of Sai The empire of these sovereigns would seem to have ex as far east as the Indus. The period is B.C. 745-705. Biblical account of the religious changes introduced by conquests into Samaria, and the effect of Jewish influe the further east, is pertinent to the present inquiry shows the estimation in which the Assyrians held th of their neighbours, and vice versa. It points to re toleration, and to a state of religious thought and beli as would directly tend to the acceptance by one people superstitions and symbols of their neighbours.\n\nThe Chaldaeans and Assyrians who were sent westward inhabit the desolated cities of Samaria informed the syrian sovereign after their arrival that things were n with them, that they were suffering, so they believed the displeasure of the \"God of the land\" because t not worship him aright, they \"knew not his man therefore he hath sent lions among them, and behol slay them, because they know not the manner of the the land.\" The monarch, desirous of assisting his st and in the firm belief that the \"God of the land vindictively injuring them, found it necessary in his ment to propitiate the offended Deity by sending l Samaria one of the expatriated Jewish priests. \"thither,\" he commanded, \"one of the priests wh brought from thence . . . . and let him teach th manner of the God of the land.\"\n\nSimilarly, nearly three centuries later, we find t Persian king, though firmly believing in Ahura-Ma the most powerful of the gods, yet credited the gods nations on his borders with not inconsiderable author influence. In the time of Artaxerxes Longimanus, stance (B.C. 465-425), we find the sovereign decre number of important concessions to the Jews, and the following reason for doing so: \"Whatsoever is com\n\n1 2 Kings xvii. 6, 24.\n2 2 Kings xvii. 26, 27.\nby the God of Heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of Heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?\" He feared the displeasure of Jehovah the God of the Jews.\n\nThese two instances, separated by an interval of 280 years, afford an insight, as I have stated, into the religious feelings of the day. They show the feelings of the Assyrians in the eighth, and the Persians in the fifth century B.C. towards the God of the Jews. When the Assyrians and Chaldaeans settled in Samaria in the eighth century B.C., they carried thither their own worship: \"The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima, and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children to Adrammelech and Anammolech, the gods of Sepharvaim.\" It would be mere waste of time to enlarge on the feelings of the Jews towards the gods of their neighbours. Their belief in the power of those divinities was so great that, as the Scriptures tell us, the Jews perpetually excited the wrath of Jehovah by their idolatries. One after another they fell away to the adoration of Egyptian, Chaldaean, and Assyrian deities, in sun-worship even going the length of stabling the horses of the sun in the court of the temple at Jerusalem. It can scarcely be doubted that the use of sun-symbols followed sun-worship.\n\nIt does not appear unreasonable to assume that there may have been a reciprocity of superstitious ideas between the Assyrian subjects of the empire and their eastern neighbours the Hindus, similar to that which existed between the same Assyrians and their western neighbours the Jews.\n\nA century after the reign of Sargon, the Assyrian empire was finally destroyed, and Cyaxares the Median established on its ruins the foundation of the great empire that passed in the year 558 B.C. from the Medes to Cyrus the Persian. Cyrus, amongst other conquests, reduced the whole country\n\n1 Ezra vii. 23 (Revised version).\n2 Sun-god and goddess.\n3 2 Kings xvii. 30, 31.\nup to the Indus, including Afghanistan and Beluchist\u0101n; he does not appear to have crossed the Indus by territorial aggrandizement. It is during the reign of that we first find mention made of India by any writer. This is Hekataius of Miletus (B.C. 549\u2013486), by mentioning several places and cities in Northern India proves that that country was known to Europeans.\n\nIn B.C. 521 succeeded to the throne of Persia Darius Hystaspis, who, fired doubtless by the knowledge acquired by his predecessors of the internal wealth and at the time of the weakness of Trans-Indus countries, crossed the great river about the year 515 B.C., and conquered and annexed to the Persian empire the rich country of Panj\u0101b, and the Indus valley. Henceforward that portion of India lay under Persian domination till the breaking up of the Empire at the Macedonian invasion two centuries later.\n\n\"The results of this conquest,\" writes Professor Rawlinson, \"were the acquisition of a brave race capable of producing excellent soldiers, an enormous increase of revenue, and a vast influx of gold into Persia, which led probably to the introduction of gold coinage, and the establishment of commercial relations with the natives, which issued in regular trade carried on by coasting vessels between the mouths of the Indus and the Persian Gulf.\" I can concur in the opinion that commercial relations were \"established,\" if that word be taken to mean first established. It would seem more likely that commerce was consequently and greatly facilitated by the conquests of Darius, when a new and important line of communication was opened by water-way down the Indus to the Persian Gulf. The additional effect of the conquest and of Persian domination for two centuries would naturally be greatly to increase the spread of Persian ideas amongst the Hindus of that part of India, and still further to undermine the declining religion of the Vedas.\n\nThe conquered portion of India formed the 20th\n\n---\n\n1 Ancient Monarchies, vol. iii. p. 431.\nmentioned by Herodotus, and paid the enormous tribute of 360 talents of gold-dust to the imperial exchequer.\\(^1\\)\n\nIt was about this time that the Buddha arose and founded his system of philosophy. The much-vexed question of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a chronology will not here be entered into; but if Buddha\u2019s death occurred after the year 515 B.C., he must have been perfectly aware of the great conquests of Darius Hystaspis, and the representatives of the reigning family of Magadha must have trembled for the safety of their kingdom.\\(^2\\)\n\nXerxes, who succeeded Darius in 486 B.C., retained all his father\u2019s provinces, including those in India, and a body of troops raised in the Panj\u0101b served under his standard in his fruitless expedition against Greece. Herodotus describes the dress of these soldiers, the first representatives of Imperialism as understood by the Persians.\\(^3\\) Their leader appears to have been a Persian or a Parthian\u2014Pharnazathres, the son of Artabates.\\(^4\\) They fought under Mardonius at Platoca.\\(^5\\) \u201cIndia\u201d is mentioned in the Jewish Chronicles as forming part of the 127 provinces of Xerxes (Ahasuerus) and his successors.\\(^6\\)\n\nHerodotus, who flourished in the reign of Artaxerxes Longimanus (465-425 B.C.), the successor of Xerxes, repeatedly mentions India, though his own knowledge seems to have stopped short at the Indus. Ktesias, physician to Artaxerxes Mn\u0113mon (B.C. 405-359), wrote an elaborate though untrustworthy account of India. A few years later, B.C. 330, the Persian empire was completely destroyed by Alexander the Macedonian, and four years afterwards this monarch crossed the Indus, and largely extended the boundaries of the empire. His age synchronizes with that of Chandragupta, the Mauryan, and marks an epoch in the early history of India.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Herod. iii. 94, 95.\n\n\\(^2\\) Rawlinson\u2019s Ancient Monarchies, vol. iii. p. 131.\n\n\\(^3\\) We read of no Indian troops being utilized for European warfare from the days of Xerxes to those of Lord Beaconsfield.\n\n\\(^4\\) Herod. vii. 65.\n\n\\(^5\\) id. viii. 113; ix. 31.\n\n\\(^6\\) Esther i. 1, viii. 9. 1 Esdras iii. 2, etc.\nTo summarize the political condition of India up to this period, we see that its frontier marched, for nearly centuries, with that of the powerful Assyrio-Chaldean empire, and that for the two succeeding centuries a considerable portion of India lay actually under direct Persian domination, forming a Persian satrapy, under Persian governors, and paying a heavy tribute to the Persian exchequer. When it is remembered that the original stock of the Turanian inhabitants of both countries was on the same, and that this was the faith cherished by the masses of the people, it would be natural to assume that this state of things resulted in religious changes and in assimilations.\n\nIt was owing to the expedition of Alexander that India was first really made known to European nations, for the conqueror took with him a number of learned and scientific men specially selected for the purpose of collecting and recording all available information relative to the region, its tracts and their inhabitants; and their works, condensed by Strabo, Arrian, and Pliny, prove how earnestly they laboured honourably to fulfil their task.\n\nAlexander found in the Panj\u0101b and Indus valley a number of petty princes, jealous of one another and practically powerless to defend themselves, but recognizing the supremacy of Persia as their suzerain and paying tribute to him. Only, Porus or Puru, attempted to check the invasion, but he was defeated without difficulty. The Greek armies pressed on to Amritsaur, their leader being determined to conquer the whole of the north of India as far as the mouth of the Ganges; but wearied by the heat, and exhausted by the troubles and difficulties of their protracted campaign, they were compelled to abandon this project, and to journey southwards along the banks of the Jhelum. Near the confluence of the five great rivers, Alexander made a long halt, founded a city, which he called Alexandria, received there the mission of the neighbouring states, and constituted\n\n1 These were Baeto, Diognetus, Nearchos, Onesikritos, Aristoboulos, Athenes, and others.\ncapital of the satrapy. Journeying finally down the Indus, the Greek forces retired, partly by sea, partly by land through Beluchist\u0101n, and reached Susa B.C. 325.\n\nCorroborative proof of the existence in those days of considerable land trade in India is found in the mention by Herodotus of long lines of highways, marked with what we should call mile-stones, which were deemed so important by Alexander that he had them surveyed.\n\nNorthern India was now, after eight centuries of proximity to the Assyrio-Chald\u00e6an empire, and after two centuries of partial Persian domination, subjected to the influences of the Greeks, which, though not felt during a long period of time, yet produced a serious impression on the arts of the country. It is now for the first time, so far as can be gathered, that the Hindus began to carve and construct buildings in stone. During the Greek period detachments of Greek soldiers must have guarded all important Greek points in the north, while in the Alexandrian cities of Bucephalia, near Jabalpur on the Jhelum, Nic\u00e6a, on the east side of the same river, Alexandria, the modern Uchch in the southern Punj\u0101b, and P\u0101tala or Haidar\u0101b\u0101d in Sinde,\u2014there probably resided communities of Greek settlers.\u00b9\n\nMeanwhile Chandragupta, an adventurer, was acquiring power in Magadha. Everything was in his favour. The Hindu princes were impoverished and enfeebled by internal disputes and Persian requisitions, while on the death of Alexander in B.C. 323, discord ensued in the ranks of the invaders. The Indian provinces fell to the share of Alexander\u2019s General Seleukos Nikator, but his weakness was Chandragupta\u2019s strength, and when, after several troublous years, the former found time to pay serious attention to the condition of his Indian feudatories, he found himself face to face with an empire. Chandragupta had acquired such power that the Greek was paralyzed, and was forced to come to terms. An alliance ensued. Seleukos abandoned his Indian possessions, and received in return a present of 500 elephants\n\n\u00b9 Article \u201cIndia,\u201d Encyclop. Brit.\nfrom Chandragupta, a present which he commemorated in coins;\u00b9 he gave his daughter in marriage to Chandragupta and sent an ambassador, Megasthenes, to the court of the putra.\u00b2 This alliance altered the relative positions of the Greeks in India and the natives in the country. Prior to it, there seems to have been a succession of marriages between the new comers by the Hindus. After the alliance, friendly relations were established which must have largely contributed to the spread of western influences, both Greek and Persian. This friendship lasted into the time of Asoka, grandson of Chandragupta, who formed an alliance with Antiochus Theos, the grandson of Seleukos, in B.C. 256. Antiochus Soter, who murdered and then succeeded Seleukos, having in the meantime sent an embassy under Demetrius to Chandragupta's son and successor Bimbisara.\n\nDuring the preceding two centuries Buddhism had steadily gaining ground amongst the people, and Asoka made it the state religion. Proof that more intimate relations existed at this period between the Hindus and the kings of the west is found in the mention by Asoka, in his edict, of five Greek princes, Antiochus of Syria, Philadelphus of Egypt, Antigonus of Macedon, Menander of Cyrene, and Alexander of Epirus, while the king bore the title of Buddha. Buddhist ideas were spreading amongst western nations.\n\nFifty years after the time of Asoka, Euthydemus, the Greco-Baktrian, and his son Demetrius carried the Greek influence into India (B.C. 191\u2013181), and a city called Euthydemus was founded on the Jhelum.\u00b3 Eukratides, who succeeded Demetrius, conquered the country as far as Alexander's route through Patela, and appears to have sent expeditions into Sind and Gujar\u0101t (B.C. 181\u2013151). General Cunningham has expressed the opinion that the Indian provinces remained subject to the Baktrian kings during the reigns of\n\n\u00b9 Poole's Catalogue of the Coins of the Seleucid Kings, plate i.\n\u00b2 Indian Antiquary, vol. vii. p. 113, ff.

Professor Weber thinks that the Gr\u00e6co-Baktrians advanced as far as Oudh.\n\nWe have corroborative evidence in the Bible of Indian trade with the west in those days, for it is stated there that in the time of the Maccabees, Antiochus Eupator of Syria had in his army 32 war-elephants carrying Indian mahouts.\\(^1\\) This was in B.C. 163. The Persian army too, at that time, or only a few years previous, possessed 120 elephants.\\(^2\\)\n\nTo return to Northern India,\u2014the next great political event succeeding the Baktrian era was the invasion of the country by the Yueh-chi, as they are called by Chinese authors, Tartar tribes from the north-west. This took place in the first century B.C. The invaders are variously termed Scyths, Turanians, \u0160akas, Indo-Scythians. As to their invasion and its effect, I quote from Professor Max M\u00fcller's \"India, what can it teach us?\" They swept over the country, overthrew the Mauryan kingdom, and \"took possession of India, or at least the government of India, from about the first century B.C. to the third century A.D.\" The invaders belonged, in a sense, to the religion of the people, the religion that was merged into Buddhism, in opposition to the Vedic religion. \"The rise of Buddhism and its formal adoption by King A\u015boka had already considerably shaken the power and influence of the old Brahmanic hierarchy. The northern conquerors . . . were certainly not believers in the Veda. They seem to have made a sort of compromise with Buddhism, and it is probably due to that compromise, or to an amalgamation of \u0160aka legends with Buddhist doctrines, that we owe the so-called Mah\u0101y\u0101na form of Buddhism\u2014and more particularly the Amit\u0101bha worship\u2014which was finally settled at the Council under Kanishka, one of the Turanian rulers in India in the first century A.D.\"\n\n\\(^1\\) 1 Macc. vi. 30\u201337.\n\\(^2\\) id. viii. 6.\n\\(^3\\) p. 85 ff. and 274\u2013277.\ncaused a complete cessation of literary activity in though at the same time this period witnessed t construction in stone of some of the most elaborate and l architectural monuments in the country.\n\nAbout the year 20 B.C. we find an embassy sen India to Augustus at Rome, the credentials of whic written on skins, showing how far western usa Turanian freedom had overcome Brahmanical and B prejudices.

Enough has been said to show that the Hindus of the north lay open to constant foreign influence. I shall now attempt to show that these influences did actually take effect, as it is natural to suppose that they would have done, so that there can be nothing far-fetched in the idea that the symbolism of Buddhist days might have been, in part, of foreign and not indigenous origin.\n\nTo this end it is necessary to consider for a moment the state of religious belief in Chald\u00e6a, Persia, and India, in order to ascertain whether it is reasonable to hold that the inhabitants of either of these countries might have adopted the religious ideas of their neighbours.\n\nWhen the Aryans migrated to India they found in that country a race of non-Aryans\u2014a people of a lower type than their own, long resident in their land. The Vedic hymns characterize these last as \"non-sacrificers,\"\\(^2\\) \"without gods,\" \"without rites,\" but sufficiently civilized to possess \"castles and forts.\" They seem to have been worshippers of trees and serpents\u2014their principal deity was an earth-god. They practised all kinds of fetish-worship.\\(^3\\) The Aryans brought with them their Vedas, and their worship of the manifesta-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Sewell's Lists of Antiquities, Madras, vol. ii. p. 205, and the same author's Sketch of the Dynasties of Southern India, p. 65.

Once in India the Aryan religion became corrupted. Ignorant superstition had its natural effect of evil and dread of the unknown supernatural, by constant contact with people who feared and gradually overcame enfeebled confidence and trust in the races that formed the powerful second Assyrian in the two centuries preceding the age of Buddha to bring about this state of things. This idea have been held by Fergusson, who thought that the Vishnu was imported from the West, and that the nothing more than the hawk-headed divinity of the As Fergusson thus sums up the religious question as it stood sixth century B.C. \"The blood of the Aryans had been mixed and so impure that the Veda was no longer as a rule of faith, and when \u015a\u0101kya-Muni availed of the opportunity so afforded . . . . his call was received in a manner which led to the most important sequences.\" He asserts, though with some hesitation, as many as nine or ten of the Nandas, the immediate successors of Chandragupta, were serpent-worshippers.\n\nThe faith of the Chaldeans may be best summarized in words of Professor Rawlinson:\u2014\"The worship was polytheistic. Various deities . . . divided the allegiance of the people, and even of the kings, who regarded with respect . . . some fifteen or sixteen personages. These principal gods were a far more numerous assortment of inferior or secondary divinities . . . recognized throughout the country. Finally the Pantheon contained host of mere local gods or genii, every town, and every village in Babylonia being under the protection of its own particular divinity.\" But this description actually have been written for Turanian India, if\n\n1 Tree and Serpent Worship, p. 76.\n2 Tree and Serpent Worship, pp. 87-89.\n3 Rawlinson's Ancient Monarchies, vol. i. p. 110.\njudge of what Turanian beliefs were by considering what they are to this day, notably in the most Turanian tracts in Southern India. It is important for present purposes that this should not be lost sight of. The beliefs of the Chald\u00e6ans were almost identical with those of the masses in India. In Chald\u00e6a, however, \"the religion was to a certain extent astral. The heaven itself, the sun, moon, and the five planets have each their representative in the Chald\u00e6an Pantheon among the chief objects of worship. At the same time it is to be observed that the astral element is not universal, but partial.\"\u00b9\n\nThe religion of the Assyrians closely resembled that of the Chald\u00e6ans.\u00b2\n\nThe early Persians, like the early Indians, were serpent-worshippers, and followed Turanian beliefs. As in India, so in Persia, a higher form of religion spread itself over the land. This last was, indeed, one and the same. I may be pardoned for again quoting Fergusson in this respect:\u2014\"At the time when the Greeks became acquainted with Persia, the whole country, under the influence of the Ach\u00e6menian kings, had been brought to acknowledge Zoroastrianism with its elemental fire-worship as their principal form of faith. This religion in its purity . . . . was the faith which the Iranians brought with them from their original seats when they separated from the Indian Aryans, and was practically their common faith both in India and in Persia. In the latter country, however, it was strangely mixed up with Magism, a religion of much more Semitic, or even, it may be suspected, Turanian form, and the two were at that time so blended in the Grecian accounts at least that it is now impossible to separate the one from the other.\"\u00b3\n\nThus, in Persia and in India there was a close similarity of religious belief,\u2014Turanianism overlaid with the purer worship of divine manifestations of Power in Nature. The hostility of the priesthood practically proves the connection, for the great Persian Divinity Ahura-Mazda was an Asura,\n\n\u00b9 id. p. 111.\n\u00b2 Ancient Monarchies, vol. ii. p. i.\n\u00b3 Tree and Serpent Worship, p. 42.\nor malignant spirit to the Hindu, while the Hindu became a demon or devil to the Persian. The difference consisted in the development rather than in the germ. Persians purified their religion into something a monotheism, the Hindus sank lower and lower in depths of Turanian poly-d\u00e6monism. But in their religious beliefs were identical, and there is no for rejecting as absurd and fanciful a theory that their symbolism may have been the same. Sun-symbols might have survived to a late date in both countries.\n\nThe above summary, however, only goes to prove possibilities. It is necessary, now, to come to more certain clear proofs that the Hindus of Northern India did succumb, and that in no small degree, to foreign influence in pre-Buddhist days.\n\nProfessor Max M\u00fcller has noted an abrupt change in Hindu literature between the time of the Vedas and the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as (i.e., previous to 600 B.C.). This occurred during the period of the powerful later Assyrian when the frontiers of India and of that empire touched another along the whole of the north-west and west Kabul to Karr\u0101chi, and when Assyrian and Ch influences were likely to make themselves most felt. This change is stated by the learned Professor in his History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, to have been so important it led to \"a complete misunderstanding of the original intentions of the Vedic hymns.\" The old Aryan religion was revolutionized. The result is thus epitomized by a writer in this Journal, \"New gods were invented in succession, and some of these new mythological personages shadowed and supplanted the deities of the Vedic system. Monstrous cosmogonies were invented and . . . a new mode of describing the world is adopted . . . In a new system of the world, the sun, moon, and stars, together with the zodiac and the twenty-seven lunar mansions,\n\n1 \"Ancient Monarchies,\" vol. ii. p. 324. Seventh Oriental Monarchies.\n2 The Rev. J. Edkins, J.R.A.S. Vol. XVIII. n.s. Part I. p. 6 (Jan.\nan entrance, and later the Ptolemaic system.\u201d It has also been pointed out that about a century or more after the probable era of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, \u015a\u0101kyamuni found the Hindus believing in the doctrine of metempsychosis, which is by origin an Egyptian, not a Vedic doctrine. Now if all this is not an exaggeration, and there is little reason to suppose that that is the case, it seems to afford direct evidence that India was at that time subjected to some extent to Chald\u00e6an influences.\n\nMM. Perrot and Chipiez, in their admirable work on the History of Art in Chald\u00e6a and Assyria, have given a clear account of the Chald\u00e6an system of astrology and numerical calculation, with a description of its origin, which, though it stands unproved, at least seems most reasonable and admissible when viewed theoretically. In early days, say they, in Chald\u00e6a, as in the early days of many families of the human race, fetichism, belief in demons, and spirits both malevolent and beneficent, reigned supreme, and worship or propitiation was associated with incantations and magic. As time passed on the priests added astrology to magic in their search after charms sufficiently powerful to compel to obedience those brilliant genii who inhabited the bright heavens and showed themselves to man at night. But though simple minds might believe in the power of these charms, the priests, with more keen intellectual observation, noticed that neither sun, moon, nor stars ever changed their position in obedience to the command of man. Planetary motion, however, made itself visible, and the regularity of the motion of the sun and moon was also noted; and as all was favourable for study, the air clear, the nights balmy, men set themselves to work out the meaning of the motion of the heavenly bodies. Observatories, raised high above the mists, were built, and lofty platforms erected for the purpose. Students of Astronomy began to believe that the lives of individuals were affected from the time they were born by\n\n1 Op. cit. vol. i. p. 65-73 (Armstrong\u2019s translation).\n2 \u201cCarmina vel caelo possunt deducer lunam.\u201d So Virgil many centuries later (Bucol. viii. 69).\nthe condition of the planets at the moment of birth, arose the whole system of astrology, which has had effect on the minds of men that it lasted in full force, Europe, down to the sixteenth century of our era, and present day claims here some few votaries, while in it still reigns supreme. Astrology paved the way Astronomy. In order to profit by the indications stars, in order, that is, to foretell success or disaster became necessary to foresee the positions the planet occupy in the sky on a given day or hour\u2014necessarily arrive by repeated observation at an exact knowledge of the route followed by the planets across the sky, distinguish them one from another by name. This was a close, accurate, and patient study, which had of incalculable benefit to mankind.\n\nThe Chaldean system of Astrology spread far and wide. The Persians seem to have been second only to the irresistible monarch Cyrus, in need. Pseudo-Smartha, or \"Gomates, the Magian,\" a priest, was by and held it firmly for a short time. Originally a Median race they appear to have adopted and carried on the sciences of the star-gazers after the fall of Babylon and establishment of the Empire Medes, for whom the Greeks and Romans came in contact with them, to be known called indifferently \"Magi\" or \"Chaldaeans.\" A good Chaldaean magic, as intimately known to the Jews, who were largely influenced from the prophecy of Isaiah xlvii. 12., who, apostrophized his wife, or under the title \"daughter of the Chaldaean,\" says,\u2014\"with the enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, . . . increased in the multitude of thy counsellors: let now the astrologers, the starry monthly prognosticators, stand up and save thee from the things thou art about to do.\" Though all forms of magics were forbidden by the law, the Judaism was opposed to Magicians, the Magi contrived to pass themselves as the representatives of the religion of Persia. As they were men of science, so they were treated with contempt. Plato held them in the highest esteem. All over the civilized world the arts of arts of nature, as taught by the Magi, came to be practiced. The physicians enjoyed a respected position in society, their services being required as much by the king and the peasant. Under the Roman Empire many of the important professions in the Art of Magic, who were known as \"Chaldaeans,\" \"Mathematici.\" When Roman chiefs built their villas in the newly conquered island of Britain, they brought with them the old superstitions of their own country. The old astrological emblems was inscribed upon the decorated mosaic flooring of their principal rooms. One is found in the Roman villa at Whiteman's Town in Somersetshire, near Bath, at Headington in the Isle of Wight, and in curious connection with both places is the figure of an astrologer with a divining-rod in his hand, in the field of the dancer, as if in the air, close by his head\u2014a place, under the Assyrians and Persians, an anthro-pomorphic which would have been depicted\u2014an Oriental sun-emblem, the circle or pillar, exactly as seen at Amaravati and Sanchi. It seems most probable that design stamps the astrologer as a representative of eastern magic.\nThe Chaldaeans, for purposes of calculation, established an intricate system of numeration. They began by counting on their fingers by units of five. Then they adopted a notation by sixes and twelves as an improvement on the former, since the figure ten could be divided neither into three nor four equal parts.\\(^1\\) Numeration by sixes led to their division of time into the sos of 60 years, the ner of 600 years, and the sar of 3600 years. Lenormant points out that 60 may be divided by any divisor of ten or twelve. \u201cOf all numbers that could be chosen as an invariable denominator for fractions it has most divisors.\u201d\\(^2\\) Founded on a sexagesimal numeration, the metrical system of Babylon and Nineveh was the most scientific of all those practised by the ancients.\n\nThe Chaldaeans began by registering the phenomena. They noted seven planets, including the sun and moon, and observed the apparent march of the sun through the constellations that are still called the \u201cSigns of the Zodiac,\u201d and it seems that they even went so far as to recognize the annual displacement of the equinoctial point upon the ecliptic, but their instruments were too defective to enable them to go very far. They used for astronomical calculations the solar year of \\(365\\frac{1}{4}\\) days, with which they made themselves acquainted, though for convenience they used the lunar year in civil life. The Greek astronomer, Epigenes, declares that the Chaldaeans had preserved their calculations for an incredible number of years, and it is certain that many tablets containing stellar and planetary observations have been discovered. They believed in seven celestial deities, those of the Sun, Moon, and five great planets\u2014Adar (Saturn), Merodach (Jupiter), Nergal (Mars), Istar (Venus), and Nebo (Mercury).\n\nThe modern European system of time-calculation is derived, almost certainly, from Chaldea. Hence our sexagesimal divisions. We have sixty minutes to an hour, sixty seconds\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Aur\u00e9s, Essai sur le Syst\u00e8me m\u00e9trique Assyrien, p. 10 (in the Recueil de Travaux relatifs \u00e0 la Philologie et \u00e0 l\u2019Arch\u00e9ologie Egyptiennes et Assyriennes, vol. iii.).\n\n\\(^2\\) F.

The Hindus, deriving their method equally from dividing time into cycles of sixty years, and their division of twenty-four minutes each. A similar seximal division of years is in use both in China and probably carried thither on the introduction of Buddhism from India, for there are separate and distinct indigenous systems in use in both countries.\n\nWith regard to the days of the week, the Indians, like European nations, divide the days into groups of seven named in the same order in all countries, after the moon, and five great planets of the Chaldeans. Cunningham contributed to the *Indian Antiquary* an interesting paper on this subject. He writes: \"good evidence to show that the week days, as named after the seven planets, were in use, both in Persia and in the same time as in the West, and perhaps even earlier. We have the testimony of Celsus, who lived during the reign of Augustus and Tiberius, that the Persian king had seven gates, named after the sun and planets in order, from Saturn to the Sun.\" Proof that this system was early in vogue in India is afforded by a passage in the life of Apollonius by Philostratus. He says: \"The Indian Iarchas gave Apollonius seven rings, each bearing the name of one of the seven stars, and he wore them alternately, according to the particular name of the day.\" As Philostratus derived his information from the Assyrian Iarchas, who actually accompanied Apollonius, this notice is consistent with the date of his travels, between A.D. 20 and 40. The use of the week days named after the seven stars was therefore, already established in India at least as early as the beginning of the Christian era.\" General Cunningham shows by diagrams how the calculation by Indians of twenty-four minutes each results in the same order of days of the week as the European division. He concludes by saying that though there is no direct evidence\n\n---\n\n1 *Indian Antiquary*, xiv. 1 (Jan. 1885).\n2 Philost. *Vit. Apollonii*, iii. 41. Prinlax's *Apollonius of Tyana*, \"Postscript\" below, p. 405).\nthe age of the scheme, it appears to have been in use in Media and Babylonia for several centuries before the Christian era. And with this conclusion probably few will be found to disagree.\n\nIn treating of the origin of the *trisula*, which he connects with the Chaldaean cuneiform form sign for Taurus $\\tau\\kappa$, the late Edward Thomas saw nothing fanciful in the supposition that the early Hindus possibly borrowed the *trisula* symbol from their western neighbours. He wrote: \"The dawning science of Astronomy, in its concurrent deceptive phase of Astrology, must readily have identified itself with kindred magic in the interchange of signs and symbols, as in other mutual aids.\"\u00b9\n\nWe find therefore that the Chaldaeans succeeded in introducing into India their astronomical and hence their astrological system, their divisions of time and their nomenclature of the days of the week, all of which are in daily use at the present day. The system of astrology has fast hold of the people of India at the present day, as is well known. From highest to lowest, no man who can afford to pay for it ever dreams of entering on any new or important undertaking without obtaining the opinion of the astrologer of the village or family as to when a lucky moment will occur. Most of the villages of Southern India have, to this day, a paid astrologer for domestic use.\n\nOther and very important evidence of foreign influence in India in early days is afforded by the alphabet in use in the days of A\u015boka (250 B.C.). No other alphabet has been introduced since that day. All the alphabets at present in use are modifications of that original. Dr. Burnell believed\u00b2 that the alphabet of A\u015boka had been derived originally from Western Asia before the time of Alexander, and whether this view is correct or not, it was at least the view of a shrewd and critical scholar. He writes: \"I have already mentioned the numerous indications that point to a Semitic origin of the Indian alphabets, and which are generally received\n\n\u00b9 J.R.A.S. (New Series), Vol. I. p. 484.\n\u00b2 South Indian Palaeography, pp. 1-9.\nas sufficient; the immediate original is, however, certain. Three probable sources may be suggested first is that the Indian alphabet came directly from I and was introduced by the early Phoenician trade second is that the original of these alphabets is to be in the modified Phoenician alphabets used by the Hi of Arabia, and this has lately been put forward as a tained fact.\u00b9 As a third possibility I would suggest the Indian alphabets may be derived from an character used in Persia or rather Babylonia.\u201d He his discussion of the subject by admitting that the nation at present available is too scanty to justify precise inference, but that he inclines to look on the character as the original.\n\nProfessor Max M\u00fcller also believes that the alphabet was derived from the West. The Hind selves admitted that it was of foreign origin. P\u0101\u1e47ini date is variously assigned to the fourth, third, an century B.C., calls it the \u201cYavan\u0101ni lipi,\u201d though \u201cYavana\u201d may apply to any nation of so-called outside India.\n\nIt must not be forgotten that the alphabet was introduced long before A\u015boka\u2019s day; for though the known inscription extant earlier than 250 B.C., it that the character must at that time have undergone modifications in India since its introduction, for no exactly corresponding to it has yet been discovered though many exist of a date considerably earlier great Buddhist monarch.\n\nTo turn now for a few moments to the architec sculpture of India in the earliest period known subject which is perhaps more important than al present purpose. It will be remembered that no building or rock-cut cave exists in India of a date ol the third century B.C. Is the architecture of in growth? or does it show signs of Western influen\n\n\u00b9 By Lenormant, Essai sur la Propagation de l\u2019Alphabet Ph\u00e9nicien table vi.\nanswer seems easy to give. The general shape of the structures would appear to be of Indian origin, derived from previously existing buildings, probably made in wood, and adapted to Hindu requirements; but in the ornamentation of these structures, in the decoration of the surface, and in the shape of such pillars as were erected by the Buddhists, they seem to have had recourse to Persian models. The style has been termed Indo-Persian, its *fons et origo* being at Persepolis.\n\nThis is so well known in the present day that it may seem superfluous, in a Society like this, to enlarge on the subject. It might be taken as an accepted fact. But it is, perhaps, well to note shortly the opinion of such a judge as Fergusson. He states that all the *l\u0101ts* or detached pillars of the time of A\u015boka \"are similar to one another. Circular stone shafts, . . . . surmounted by a capital with the falling-leaf, or bell-shaped form found at Persepolis. This form of the capital, together with the Grecian or rather Assyrian honeysuckle ornament with which it is generally associated, are two of the most valuable ethnographical indications which the architecture of this day affords.\"\u00b9 The presence of winged lions and other animals on the base and abacus of the pillar is another point of resemblance, the Hindu mythology containing no allusion to four-footed beasts with wings\u2014and their position on the pillar being almost conclusive as to their origin. An excellent paper on the subject appeared in the periodical called the *Friend of India*, on the 13th November, 1875. The writer described in detail the close connection observable between early Indian and Western sculpture both Persian and Greek. And it is remarkable that for several centuries, down to the most flourishing period of Buddhist Art, the period of the Amar\u0101vati Tope, the last and most exquisite of its class whose construction may in part belong to a period five centuries later than that of A\u015boka, during the whole of which it would seem that the Arts had flourished amongst\n\n\u00b9 *Tree and Serpent Worship*, p. 94.\nthe Buddhists, the same type of pillar-capital, shaft is found, and the same general form of con During all those years no indigenous art had arise: the old foreign designs. The pillars and pilasters Amar\u0101vati Tope are in form substantially the pil pilasters of Bharhut and S\u0101\u00f1ch\u012b.\n\nIt is now time to turn to the special subject of the paper, the symbols in use amongst the early Bud exhibited in the sculptures of the existent Topes. been shown that the Hindus lay open to Western i for many centuries, and I have endeavoured to sl they succumbed in large measure to those influenc astronomical and astrological systems, their div time, and nomenclature of days of the week, their and their architectural style, being all more or les from the Chaldeans, Assyrians, Persians, and C while it is significant that the old religion of th was revolutionized exactly at the period of the supremacy of the later Assyrian Empire. The Buddhist symbols then,\u2014are they of indigenous o were they derived from Western Asiatic sources?\n\nPure Buddhism was opposed to the use of its symbols. There was little in the doctrine of Bud appealed to the senses, and nothing remained for artists when they began to carve in stone but to fall art purposes on the old mythology, and the popul stitions, the fairy and snake-stories of the people,1 old-world symbols long in use. It is another resemblance between the Hindus and their neigh Persians, that the former appear to have acted, wit to the use of symbols, exactly as did the latter. T of the Aresta was wholly opposed to idolatry, yet the \"did not deny themselves a certain use of symbol sentation of their deities, nor did they scruple to ado idolatrous nations the forms of their religious symb\n\n1 Prof. Max M\u00fcller, Introduction to the Parables of Buddhaghosh Rogers, p. xxvi.\n2 Rawlinson's Ancient Monarchies, vol. iii. p. 351.\nThus the Assyrian winged globe, which in its turn had been borrowed from Egypt as a symbol of Semitic Ashur, was adopted by the Persians as a symbol of Aryan Ahura-Mazda; and thus, I believe, the svastika, the dharmachakra (so-called), and the trisula were borrowed by Hindu Buddhists from pre-existent forms, possibly in use in India in pre-Buddhist days, but ultimately derived from Assyria, Chald\u00e6a, and Persia. And when it is remembered that all three of these symbols were probably sun-symbols, the theory is rendered still less improbable, for of all emblems which would be most likely to survive amidst the fall of old creeds and the upheaval of atheistic philosophies, that relating to the ancient worship of the sun would naturally be the most prominent, offending, as it did, against no prejudices, superstitions, or beliefs. The Jews, for instance, at one period, as I have stated above, saw no wrong in introducing all the paraphernalia of the old sun-worship into the very courts of the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem\u2014and there is no reason to suppose that they had then revolted against their sacred creeds. They merely added adoration of the sun \"and all the host of heaven\"\u00b9 to the worship of their own Divinity.\n\nSimilarly, at a time when Buddhists began to use symbols, old-world sun-symbols were those which lent themselves most readily and with least perversion of ideas to the requirements of the new faith,\u2014as it was then accepted by the masses of the Turanian-blooded people, being of necessity mixed-up with a great deal of the superstitions of former days.\n\nThe emblems most frequently met with on Buddhist Topes may be divided into two classes\u2014symbols of which the origin is distinctly Buddhist, and symbols of which the shape cannot be traced to a Buddhist origin. In the first\n\n\u00b9 Under some of the kings of Judah the horses and chariots of the sun (2 Kings xxiii. 11) were stalled in the precincts of the Temple of Jerusalem. This dedication of horses to the sun was perhaps borrowed from the Persians (Herod. i. 189; Curt. iii. 3. \u00a7 11; Xen. Cyr.p. viii. 3. \u00a7 24). The Armenians and the Ma-sageta sacrificed horses to the sun (Herod. i. 216; Xen. Anab. iv. 5. \u00a7 35). It is noticeable that the horse is frequently introduced into the Amaravati sculptures in a way not yet satisfactorily explained.

Its general acceptation seems to have been as a token of good-luck and prosperity, while romantic Buddhist teachers feigned that the feet of the Buddha himself were marked with these stigma, proving that they accepted the sign as one of an older date than the birth of Buddha. Panini mentions the svastika as a sign branded for luck on the ears of cows.\n\nThe symbol called the chakra seems to be certainly an emblem of the sun. Its similarity, when raised on a pillar, to Assyrian types, has been repeatedly noticed, and it is useless for me to waste time by further discussion on the matter. As a symbol of the all-vivifying sun it was a most appropriate emblem of the Buddhist Dharma.\n\nThere remains the doubtful Tribula. What was its origin? Was it indigenous or exotic?\n\nThe figures given below are taken from Fergusson's Tree and Serpent Worship, and from Fergusson and Burgess's\n\n---\n\n1 Tree and Serpent Worship, plate lxxvii. p. 229.\n2 Prof. Max Muller, in Schliemann's Ilios (pp. 245-7); Goldstucker, Panini, his place in Sanskrit Literature, p. 59.\n3 The chakra occupies the most prominent place on the summit of the north gateway of the Sanchi Tope, flanked by two tridents.\nEARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM.\n\nCave Temples.

My belief is\u2014I say it with diffidence, because I am aware that the idea will sound at first preposterous to many minds, and I admit myself fully open to conviction that a better origin be eventually suggested\u2014my belief is that this much-discussed tribula is nothing more nor less than the conventionalized scarab\u2014a sun-emblem derived from the Assyrians and Persians, and thence remotely from Egypt.\n\nIt may not be inappropriate to show how other symbols have spread from nation to nation, and been adopted creed after creed, in order to afford some basis for supposition that this theory need not be scouted as improbable, more especially since I have already pointed out the apparently strong influence exercised by the Assyrians and Chaldeans on the early inhabitants of India. I will take, for example, first the old Egyptian tau or crux ansata. Whatever this emblem originally signified, its rise began in Egypt. It was thence adopted by the Assyrians, and is found on sculptures at Khors\u016bbd, on ivories, Nimrud, and on Ninevite cylinders. It is observed on numerous coins of the Mediterranean coasts at a later date, especially on coins of Cyprus. Ezekiel the prophet was impressed by the idea that the symbol was one of great importance; that, in his vision, he conceived the tau as marked on the foreheads of all those persons who were destined to be saved.\n\n---\n\n1 Tree and Serpent Worship, p. 115.\n2 id., plates lxx., lxxi., lxxii.\n3 Ezekiel ix. 4, 5, 6.\nThe use of the *tau* somehow spread into ancient America, for it is found on sculptures at Palenque and Copan. A peculiar anthropomorphic form of the *tau*, found at the demolition of the serapeum at Memphis, appears to have given rise to the earlier semi-anthropomorphic form of the Ephesian Artemis, whence it spread into Greece. As a sign of security the *tau* was adopted by the Christian order of St. Anthony of Ethiopia, one of the earliest religious orders ever founded by Christians, dating about 370 A.D. It is found on Hebrew and Gnostic charms, and Joseph von Hammer points to it as the all-potent sign of the Knights Templars.\n\nSimilarly the winged globe of Egypt seems to have been accepted as a symbol of divine power and influence by the Chald\u00e6ans and Assyrians, as well as by other neighbouring races. Just as it was sculptured over the doorways of Egyptian pylons, so it finds similar place amongst the sculptured remains of those born imitators, the Ph\u0153nicians. In an anthropoid form it is universal in Assyria and Chald\u00e6a where it represents the sun-god Asshur, and afterwards in Persia where it stood for Ahura-Mazda, overshadowing and protecting the sovereigns in all their successful undertakings, whether in war or the chase. It is found as a guardian of doorways even in Mexico and Central America, though how it got there is at present a mystery.\n\n---\n\n1 See notes in the *Antiquary* of March and August, 1881.\n2 See Catherwood's *Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan* (1854), p. 386, for an example at Ocosingo in Chiapas.

Perrot and\nwinged globe had any intimate relation in origin with scarabaeus I will not stop to consider, but certain emblem called the mithir, as seen in some Phoenician examples, may equally be looked at as a form of the globe, or as a scarab in act of flight, and on the obverse of some of the satrapes the mithir stands in the same position to the monarch whose figure is depicted on the obverse as the anthropoid winged globe does to the conqueror of Assyria and Chaldea. It protects and guards him. On the coin the symbol appears to be a flying scarab (fig. 3), with its wings extended; in another (figure 4) of the satrap it is shaped like the pennate globe; while the satrap depicted in Di Cesnola's Cyprus, plate xxxv. 20, is represented as a large-winged scarab. The mithir is found, in instances, on coins of Cyprus associated with Egyptian emblems; and I desire to call especial attention to these emblems in the field of the coins depicted in De Luyne's Numismatique et Inscriptions Cypriotes, plate ii. figs. 15, and plate vi. figures etc., since these emblems (figs. 5), both over the lions on the obverse and over the male figure on the reverse occupy the same position as does the mithir on the coins, protecting and guarding the principal figure. This emblem in question is often called the taurus symbol.\n\nChippiez, i. 87 (Armstrong's translation). De Luyne, Numismatique et Inscriptions Cypriotes, pl. iii.

The fact that in both countries the symbol is used in a mutilated form, apparently for the sake of simplicity, may be used as a strong argument in favour of a common origin, for it is surely not usual thus to cut a symbol in half. In India the form is most undoubtedly a half-tri\u0161ula, and in the Cyprian examples, though its origin is not so clear, its position on the coin suffices to identify it.\n\nThis mutilated form is constantly observed on Phoenician inscriptions,\\(^3\\) where it is elevated on a pedestal or standard\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Above, Figure 2, p. 392.\n\n\\(^2\\) The coin is from Fergusson's *Tree and Serpent Worship* (p. 162, No. 1), a coin of Kananda.

All the elements of the globe are here in its Assyrianized form\u2014the central body, in this instance somewhat heart-shaped, the lower fan-shaped tail, and the two dangling ends on the wings. But whereas in Assyria the central converted into a wheel (the disk of the sun\u2014whence the origin of the idea of the Buddhist chakra), and of an anthropoid deity, the fan-like tails being of his robes and the dangling ends being the end sash, here in America the sculptor has ignorantly d the symbol just in the way that a child would converted the central body into a face with roughly mouth, and eyes, and feet self bound in some way to for the two ends that formed part of the emblem, he has made the two long moustaches d from the upper lip of face carved on the slab.\n\nFigure 10.\n\nThe above remarks will serve to show how the emblems of Egypt have spread into other count\nbecome altered and conventionalized in the process. Now, without going necessarily so far away as Egypt, it is clear that the scarab was an emblem and a very important emblem to the Assyrians and peoples with whom the Hindus came in contact, and it is often found in a highly conventionalized form.\n\nThe original Egyptian type, as used in the hieroglyphs, is given in figure 11, taken from a sarcophagus in the British Museum, and some of its more highly conventional forms in figures 12, 13, both from the work of M.M. Perrot and Chipiez. Figure 12 is taken from a scarab depicted on a patera, and Figure 13 from a cup as given by Layard. In both instances it is represented as elevated on a column or standard.\n\nThe scarab was also largely used by the Chaldeans, and they adopted its form for their gems and seals, just as did the Egyptians. Numbers of engraved scarabs are found in Babylonia. That the emblem was in general use amongst the nations of Western Asia is shown by the numbers of scarabaei that have been found, not only in Assyria and Chaldea, but in early Greek tombs all round the Mediterranean, in Cyprus, and in a hundred different places. One source whence they were derived has lately come to light,\n\n1 History of Art in Phoenicia and Cyprus (Armstrong's translation), ii. 330, 331.\n2 id. i. 77.\nMr. Petrie having found at Naukratis several scarabs intended for export to the Mediterranean, the isles of the Phoenician colonies, and Etruria. The scarab was adopted by the Phoenicians at the same time as the cylinder (Assyria), and the cone (Asia Minor) as a pattern engraved gems, but the cylinder and cone gave way to the superior charms of the scarab and scaraboid, latter forms largely predominated in later years.\n\nA number of scarabs have been found in Sardinia at Cagliari. They bear engravings of degenerate Egyptian type, mostly belong to the period between the end of the second and the end of the third century B.C., when Carthage was supreme in the Western Mediterranean, and the Punic cities in Sardinia enjoyed their greatest prosperity.\u00b9\n\nA very important link between the Egyptian or Assyrian scarab and the Indian trisula will be found figured in Lajard's \"Culte de Mithra,\" plate x. figure 3. It is represented in a highly-conventionalized form (fig.) engraved on a gem, having in the center the sun and moon, and at the side a legend, showing it to be probably of Sasanian origin. That the figure is intended to represent a scarab is clear from the fact that the representation on it of the ball is rolled up by the natural scarabaeus, which ball is often found on other figures of the scarab much more closely resembling nature. If to the central member of the figure a pair of wings be added, there will be found the entire and unmistakeable Buddhist trisula complete in all its parts.\n\nComparison of the two designs can hardly fail to impress any one that, if not intentional, the resemblance is extraordinary. The details of course vary, but the general idea is identical.\n\nThe trisula is found repeated over and over again at Amaravati, at Buddha Gaya,\u00b2 at Sanchi, and indeed throughout India.\n\n\u00b9 Edinburgh Review, Jan. 1886, p. 209.\n\u00b2 Tree and Serpent Worship, p. 116, where it is figured.\nBuddhist Topea. That it was in use before the S\u0101nchi Tope was erected is shown by the coin, given on figure 7 above, of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, brother of Amogha, whom Thomas believed to be one of the nine Nandas, the predecessors of Chandragupta. Fergusson differs from this, asserting that the coin is more modern, but he declares it to be certainly older than the first of the S\u0101nchi gateways, and his view is probably correct. The coin is figured in Tree and Serpent Worship (p. 162, note 1). It contains several of the common Buddhist emblems, including the trisula in its truncated shape, as in figure 2.\n\nFergusson, as I have already remarked, noticed the similarity between the trisula symbol, the caduceus of the god Mercury, and the sign of the planet Mercury. General Cunningham has made the same observation. Describing a coin of Pharaspes or Pharnaspes of the Alexandrian period, he mentions that it bears on it \"a caduceus without a handle, which is the zodiacal sign for Taurus.\" The symbol is, I contend, similar to the Buddhist truncated trisula (fig. 2), and similar to the Cypriot emblem alluded to above (fig. 6). That it is a coin of Persian origin is proved not only by the fact of its bearing a legend in Pahlavi characters, but because the Assyrian man-headed winged bull on the obverse wears on his head a Persian tiara. My impression is that the trisula and the caduceus spring from precisely the same original\u2014the scarab.\n\nThe form of the Buddhist trisula as represented (figure 1) at Amar\u0101vat\u012b, for instance, is explainable thus. The body of the scarab is roughly drawn as a circle and often, as such, decorated with the circular lotus-disks of the outer rail with the conventional water-leaf ornament; the upraised fore-legs and the head become conventionalized into rounded raised arms with a prominent central member; the wings are depicted as leaf-like projections on each side of the body; the hind-legs are rendered in form similar to the\n\n---\n\n1 id. p. 116, note.\n2 J.A.S. Bengal, L., part i. p. 171 (1881).\nfore-legs, but, as is essential to the general idea, not decorated. The hind-legs, as I cannot avoid calling the tribula, are specially noticeable, as the Amaravati give them a strangely animal look, especially above would be the knee-joint. Moreover, it must be noted the scarab proper (figure 11) is always depicted certain necessary claw-like projections on the fore- none, or very slight ones, on the hinder legs. A similar difference is observable in the Indian tri extremities of the upper members being ornamented in trefoil-shape, while the lower extremities are marked. It was, perhaps, absence of ornamentation the lower members their being discarded intermediate form given in figure 15\u2014where the upper members are strongly stated while the lower lin dwindled into mere adjuncts. This form from the summit of the gateway at Sanchi.\n\nThe form of the may be explained thus: body of the scarab is drawn as before in a circle, and hind-legs are placed in the usual position, the extremities of the fore-legs having a certain development wanting in the hind-legs, in accordance with requirements. The wings are omitted, as, viewing the original form (figure 1), well might be. The whole being elevated on a staff, the original form being lost sight of, the shape is caused to represent two snakes twisted round one another developments at the extremities of the upper taking, in this instance, the form of heads, the lower\n\n---\n\n1 *Tree and Serpent Worship*, Plate x. a, p. 113.\nling to a point for the tail. Figures 16, 17 show the transition.\n\nFigure 16. Figure 17.\n\nIf the lower member be omitted, the caduceus assumes the form in which it was sometimes used by priests. There is a bronze specimen (figure 18) in the British Museum, of date 440\u2013430 B.C. Here, it will be observed, the figures can hardly be looked on as twisted snakes, for they have no tails. This has the appearance of a transitional variety\u2014where the snakes\u2019 heads are merely introduced as an ornament at the ends of the two curved upper arms of the old taurus symbol (compare fig. 6b). In the Phoenician examples alluded to above (figure 8b), the same symbol is found. In a coin of Herod I. (B.C. 37\u20134) the same symbol is depicted, but with two little projections below (figure 19). These projections are certainly not snakes\u2019 tails. They are more like small wings, yet the whole symbol has been accepted as representing a caduceus. These instances seem to point to the origin of the caduceus being, not serpents twisted round a staff, but the old taurus symbol developed.\n\nThere can be little doubt that the celebrated idol of Jagann\u0101tha (Vishnu as Krishna) at Puri in Cuttack was originally one of these trisulas. Figure 20, taken from General Cunningham\u2019s Bhilsa Topes, represents this well-\n\n---\n\n1 It bears the inscription \u039b\u039f\u039d\u0393\u0395\u039d\u0391\u0399\u039f\u03a3 \u0395\u039c\u0399 \u0394\u0395\u039c\u039f\u03a3\u0399 . . . \u201cI am the public (herald) of the people of Longan\u016b,\u201d a town in Sicily.\n2 Madden\u2019s Coins of the Jews, No. 4, p. 109.\n3 Thomas (J.R.A.S. n.s. Vol. I. p. 483) expressed his belief in the identity of this figure with the \u201cTaurus symbol.\u201d\nknown image. It shows an anthropomorphic t\n\nsimilar to the instances given above of the Assyrian symbols of Ashur and Ahura-Mazda, and Ephesian Artemis, the former being derived from the circle, the latter from the Egyptian tau.\n\nI have in my possession a remarkable copper coin, of which a woodcut is given in Figure 21. I know of no existing series identifying this coin, but the form of the figure is archaic. It was given to me by Sir Elliot, who was unable to assign it to any hitherto known series. The figure of Vishnu here appears with arms in an attitude singularly recalling the trisula and the Jagannatha idol above alluded to. This clearly intended to represent Vishnu, and no other is shown by the Vaishnavite emblem, the tortoise side (the Kurma-aratara). The figure on this coin and at Puri further goes to the question whether, after all, the which Vaishnavas at the present day their foreheads (figure 22), and which is generally known as some sort of trident, is not another modification of the trisula, the central circle being omitted (see figure 7). I know of no other reasonable explanation of its form.\n\nWhile recognizing the danger and uselessness of baseless identifications too far\u2014of allowing mere simi\nof form to influence the mind\u2014I cannot refrain from pointing out with diffidence, and I admit without any sanction of proof, a similarity which struck me six years ago, and which I have since seen no reason absolutely to reject as absurd.\n\nOn the angles of the base of a bronze statuette found in a tomb in the Polledrara cemetery at Vulci in Etruria, and figured in Dennis's Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria (vol. i. p. 423), and Micali's Monumenti Inediti (1844), plate vi. fig. 2, is found the annexed figure (fig. 23).\u00b9 This is in all respects similar to the forms represented above. It has all the members of the scaraboid form so often alluded to\u2014the body, wings, fore-legs, and hind-legs\u2014the only difference being that in this instance the curve of the lower members is altered so as to bring the upper and lower limbs into conventional regularity. It must also be noticed that numbers of scarabs have been found in Northern Italy. With reference to its date, the author writes: \"The antiquity of this bust is proved, not only by the style, but by the workmanship,\u2014not being cast, but being formed of thin plates of bronze hammered into shape, and finished with the chisel\u2014the earliest mode of Etruscan toreutics.\" That the ornament was intended to be looked at in the position in which I have depicted it is clear from its place on the bronze plinth. Now, if any one will take the trouble to look at this woodcut from the side of the page, instead of holding the page in the usual way, he will observe that the figure is precisely that of a conventional fleur-de-lys. This may be a pure flight of fancy, but still it is noticeable that Northern Italy was, if not the home of the fleur-de-lys, at least one of the sites of its firm adoption. I lay no great stress on this identification, however, contenting myself with simply calling attention to the curious resemblance. The fleur-de-lys has been derived\n\n\u00b9 Most unfortunately the portion of bronze plinth on which the ornament is cut appears never to have found its way to the British Museum, where the rest of the bust is. But Micali is a very accurate and trustworthy copyist, and that the plinth did actually exist is proved by his alluding to it in his text.\nfrom a hundred different originals. This is merely a\nand first.\n\nPostscript.\n\nThe Life of Apollonius of Ty\u0101na written by Ph\nhas been alluded to above (p. 385). This work\nally supposed to be historically valueless. It is\nthat Apollonius travelled to India about the year\nbut it is almost certain that this \"Life,\" which ne\nits appearance till it was presented to the Emp\nDomna, the wife of Severus (A.D. 222-235), was a\nfabrication, based on the information recorded by\nwriters.

The same king, Phraotes, tells Apollonius that he had been \"brought up by his father in the Greek fashion till the age of twelve; that he was then sent to the Brahmins, and treated by them as a son, for 'they especially love,' he observed, 'those who know and speak Greek, as akin to them in mind and disposition.'\" Passages from Nicolaus Damascenus, Diodorus, Plutarch, Dio Chrysostom, and \u00c6lian, corroborate this account of the spread of Greek ideas, and the Greek language, amongst the Hindus.\n\nLater on we are introduced to a dull-witted and unenlightened monarch, who insults Apollonius. Being afterwards convinced of his error, we are told, \"the king burst into tears . . . and attributed his prejudices against the Greeks to the tales and falsehoods of Egyptian travellers, who, while they boasted of their nation as wise and holy and author of those laws relating to sacrifices and mysteries which obtain in Greece, described the Greeks as men of unsound judgment, the scum of men . . . etc. . . .\" Third-century authors, then, believed that India was frequently visited by Egyptian travellers, as well as by Babylonians.\n\nIt is clear, then, that the author of this \"Life of Apollonius\" conceived that he would best impose on the credulity of his age by accepting a very close and frequent intercommunication between India, Babylon and Egypt, before and up to the date of Apollonius (40 A.D.), as in the regular nature of things. Had there been no such regular intercommunication, he would not have written the passages quoted above.\nNote by Sir George Birdwood on the above\n\nEvery article of Hindu manufacture, excepting descript curiosities made for Europeans, had a significance, and their ornamentation was all symboli himself, he had no doubt that nearly every symbo in India came originally from Mesopotamia. This not yet be demonstrated in every case; but he h book he was preparing for the press would prove great many cases: and it might be inferred, witho proof, from the commercial history of India. I not attribute much to the direct influence of Egypt was operative millenniums before the appearance of t on the scene of history, yet indirectly it must h a great initial influence on the development of A Egyptian caravan commerce became continuous w of Mesopotamia about B.C. 2000, and thus helped pagate a common Egypto-Mesopotamian type of i and decorative art from Inner Africa to Centr and when the Aryas began to move into Persia, ai and Anterior Asia, and Europe, they moved direct this line of propagation of Egypto-Mesopotamian h art, and this, probably, largely accounts for the resemblances between the household arts of all the and semi-civilized countries of the Old World.\n\nabiding influence of Mesopotamia on India, as at fested, particularly in the arts of Southern India, w effects of the Macedonian conquest were not dire was not developed until the 7th and 6th centuries Ptolemy I. in Egypt, and Nebuchadnezzar Babylonia, first organized the navigation and com the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, a carried on down to the conquests of the Saracens. It itself was the direct result in his (Sir George Bi\n\n1 This note is the substance of Sir G. Birdwood's reply to the question whether he had observed any indications of symbolism in In fabrics, when Mr. Sewell's paper had been read at the Society's Me 31st June, 1886.\nopinion, as he had some years ago stated in the *Athen\u00e6um*, of this enlarged commercial intercourse; for Buddhism was simply commercialized, internationalized Hinduism, which reverted at once to the national, strongly anti-commercial type, formulated in \"The Code of Manu,\" as soon as the old overland trade between the East and the West began to be broken up by the Mahomedans. Obviously as Buddhism itself, so its ritualistic symbolism also, must have owed much to the intercourse of the ancient Hindus with Mesopotamia.\n\nAs to the *swastika* and the *trisula* being sun-symbols, they were phallic symbols before that. He (Sir George Birdwood) took no interest in phallic symbols until they assumed the poetic form of the Garden of Eden and the Tree of Life; but there was no doubt in his mind that the *swastika* was the first symbol of the Garden of Eden, or before that of woman, and the *trisula* of the Tree of Life, or before that of man.\n\nIt was a most interesting circumstance that the latest broch\u00e9 silk manufactured for the present London season was all very decorated with the *swastika* symbol, of the same askew type as is stamped on the leaden image of the Asian Venus found by Schliemann in the ruins of \"the 3rd,\" or \"burnt city\" (\"the Homeric Ilion\") at Hissarlik.\n\nFor the above writing out the above I have purchased at the Oriental and Indian Exhibition a very primitive-looking wooden bowl from Janagarh, where it is used to pour the libations of *v\u012bta* in the sacrifices to Agni, \"the god of fire,\" \"the south,\" etc. The bowl is fashioned as the *yoni-lingam* symbol, and immediately over it is carved the symbol *Ananda-dvara*, \"the Country of Bliss,\" in which the *swastika* is represented within a square or four-sided enclosure, while at the back of it is carved a tortoise, the universal emblem in the East of fecundity.\u2014G.B.\nART.

Two opinions prevailed. Some thought that the Akkadians were in possession of the country, and had made the first steps in civilization, and invented writing, when the Semites invaded it either violently by force of arms or peacefully by slow colonization, substituting themselves little by little for the previous inhabitants. Others thought that the Akkadians invaded Babylonia, bringing \"with them along with their religion, their legends and traditions, their laws, their art, their building knowledge, agricultural skill, and that great civilizer of nations\u2014the art of writing.\" These were, however, mere suppositions, for, as far back as we can go, we see Semites and Akkadians living side by side on friendly terms, all remembrance even of the period of struggle of the two races seeming to have been lost in the Babylonian literature.\n\nIt is the study of the names of the stars in astrological texts of the Cuneiform inscriptions which revealed to me first the priority of the Semitic civilization. As already noticed by the late F. Lenormant, several names of stars are evidently Semitic, and these Semitic names are found in the Akkadian column of the bilingual list as:\n\n\\[ \\text{D.P. da-pi-nu},^2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{D.P. bi-ib-bu},^3 \\text{ etc.} \\]\n\nMore often, however, the names of stars are written ideographically, but their Semitic reading is made certain by the presence in the compound of prepositions, of the relative \\( \\ddot{s}a \\), and of the phonetic complements.

We have, for instance, the name \\( \\text{ideogram explained by} \\) \\( ha-ba-\u0161i-ra-nu \\), and translated 'tail' by Prof. Sayce, who is probably right; the phonetic reading was no doubt used in the astrological texts, as is the case for other names. The scribe who wrote the tablet published in W.A.I. vol. v. pl. 46, seems, however, to have forgotten that, and tries to explain the word by treating it as Akkadian phonetically written.\n\n\\( ha-ba \\) is rendered by \\( ahbut \\), the Assyrianized feminine form of the supposed Akkadian word \\( haba \\), and \\( si-ra-nu \\) is explained by \\( sir Anu 'the field of Anu.' \\)\n\nMany other examples could be added.\n\nAs already noticed by the late F. Lenormant, Akkadian contains many Semitic words; it is what we should expect.\n\n1 W.A.I. ii. 49, 47.\n2 We find \\( \\text{and} \\) \\( \\text{the first group being a compound ideogram, and the second the phonetic rendering, both used in connected texts.} \\)\n3 This explanation is the more curious because Akkadian is never written phonetically in this way, and in this supposed compound the god Anu would be written in a very abnormal way, and the scribe had to neglect the name of another god \\( Nin-gir-su \\), one of the oldest, whose name is found on the earliest inscriptions, and the great god of Gudea. The group of stars designated by the compound ideogram represented, no doubt, the tail of this god.\n4 In his Etudes Akkadiennes.\nTHE PRE-AKKADIAN SEMITES.\n\nHe, however, explains it by a long intercourse, but in case the oldest texts would be purer and freer from borrowed words, which is not the case; in the oldest inscriptions we find already these Semitic words more or less Akkadianized, as in the later times. These words, besides, shall see further on, indicate a more advanced state of civilization. If we accept the priority of the Semitic civilization and their occupation of Mesopotamia previous to the Akkadian invasion, everything is easily explained, and shows how the syntactical order of the languages of the relations, which has been a puzzle to the philologist, is the result of mutual influences, both having as formula I.\n\nWhen the Akkadians invaded Babylonia, the formularies of their grammar was I 1358, this is shown by the order of the incorporated pronouns. The grammar of the Semites who had possession of the land had the formula IV. This is shown by the position of the pronouns when attached to the verb at the permansive, which is the verbal noun in the construct state. For instance, in saknat-ka 'she saw thee,' we have sakna the verb, at the suffix of the 2nd feminine subject, and ka the suffix of the 2nd feminine regimem. This ideological order is the one preserved in Hebrew and Arabic which has escaped to the influence.\n\n1 I adopt the ingenious formula designed by Prof. Terrien de Laroussy in his syntactical comparative study in his course of lectures at University College. The indices are:\n\nI a.+s.+v.\nII a.+v.+s.\nIII v.+a.+s.\nIV v.+a.+s.\nV s.+a.+v.\nVI s.+v.+a.\n\n2 The primitive position of the Akkadian genitive and adjective, which is preserved in this formula, is preserved in the compound expressions, as usually we have >+T 333 333 ana-saga-in 'in the midst of the sky,' where 'sky-midst-in.'\n\n3 Often languages preserve in the verbal forms traces of the different stages through which they have passed. For instance, in French Leguet the verb is a.+v.+a. of formula VI, which is the one of modern French; but in Latin nouns are represented by pronouns it to me, it gives s.+a.+v., which is the Latin formula; if now we consider that in the verb tu-e the subject is indicated by the suffix e, we have tu-e s.+v.+a. formula II, which is that of the Aryan languages.\n\n4 I say Turanian influence, because I accept the Turanian affinity of...\nWhen the two populations came in contact, they must have found in the different, nay opposed, ideological order of their languages a great impediment in their intercourse. The Akkadian conquerors imposed their language; but, to be understood, they had to modify their syntax, and little by little these changes passed into the pure Akkadian. The Akkadians adopted partly the syntactical order of their Semitic subjects. The order of the nominative and genitive, of the noun and adjective, were reversed; the verb was left at the end of the sentence, but with the position of the subject and object reversed. The primitive ideological order was preserved in the verbal incorporation, no doubt, because the Semites having no such incorporation, it escaped their influence. The Akkadian texts give few, though very few, examples of the primitive syntactical order.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe language of the primitive Babylonian Semites, which caused such a perturbation in the Akkadian grammar, was also deeply affected, as we see by the Assyrian of the literary period. It kept, when it was only a popular vernacular dialect, for a longer period its primitive syntactical order.\\(^2\\) The proper names of the Semites preserved in the earliest commercial documents give us indeed specimens of the intermediary stages through which it had to pass. In these proper names we have many examples of verbs followed by their subjects, as *nidin-Nana*\\(^3\\) \u2018N. gave,\u2019 *bani-Sin*\\(^4\\) \u2018S. created,\u2019 *erib-Sin*\\(^5\\) \u2018S. came,\u2019 *iribam-Sin*\\(^6\\) \u2018S. increased,\u2019\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) These examples, already noticed by F. Lenormant, were considered by him as abnormal constructions.\n\n\\(^2\\) At Nineveh, which was far from the Akkadian centre of civilization, and where the Akkadians had remained, perhaps, in smaller number, the writers followed less closely the Babylonian syntactical order. Even in the official records of the Ninevite kings there is a great liberty in the arrangement of the words, the regimen of the verb is often rejected after it, etc. We have also in the Babylonian Semitic texts examples of similar inversions; but, of course, in literary works we must take into account the desire of the author for giving variety to his periods and the licence in which he indulges.\n\n\\(^3\\) B. 66, l. 34, and B. 83, l. 8. The private tablets of this early period (Rim-Sin, Hammurabi and Sam\u00fb-Iluna) have been copied by Dr. Strassmaier and published in the Transactions of the Orientalists' Congress held at Berlin.\n\n\\(^4\\) B. 57, l. 14.\n\n\\(^5\\) B. 42, l. 35.\n\n\\(^6\\) B. 65, l. 14; 71, l. 31; 91, l. 22, etc.\nibni-Sin\\(^1\\) 'S. created,' igmil-Sin\\(^2\\) 'S. favoured,' ibus-Ea\\(^3\\) 'E. made,' iskur-Ea\\(^4\\) 'Ea recorded,' etc. The proper names giving a complete sentence with an object are naturally rare; the examples we have show, however, that the object, being less intimately connected to the verb, was first rejected before; this is the intermediary stage, the formula of this construction being II:\n\narda-lu\u0161tamar-\u0160ama\u0161\\(^5\\) 'may Shamas enlighten the slave.'\n\u0160ama\u0161-ia-banit-Beltu-Gula\\(^6\\) 'the lady Gula has created my light.\n\nTo understand well the transformation of the early Babylonian grammar, we must not forget how the tenses of the Semitic verb were developed.\\(^7\\) The Assyrian permansive, which took such a great importance in the cognate languages, was primitively the verbal theme, or a kind of verbal noun in the construct state followed by the pronominal suffixes forming a genitive of position: nasa-ku, 1st pers. permansive of nasu, is 'the bringing of me' or 'my bringing,' i.e. 'I bring or brought.' The name Bani-Sin gives an example of a noun being attached to the verb as the pronoun; the meaning is 'Sin created,' but really 'the creating of Sin.' This way of expression not being found clear enough, the Semites, by the use of auxiliaries, developed another tense, the aorist;\\(^8\\) but, as the auxiliary became in time agglutinated\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) B. 32, l. 7; 62, l. 34; 78, l. 27, etc.\n\\(^2\\) B. 65, l. 22; 73, 30.\n\\(^3\\) B. 67, l. 43; 84, l. 21; 89, l. 18, etc.\n\\(^4\\) B. 89, l. 18.\n\\(^5\\) B. 52, l. 15; 73, l. 9.

Vol. XIV. pp. 105-118.\n\\(^8\\) This tense is called present or future by those who wrote Arabic grammars, but this name cannot suit, as in Assyrian it designated generally the past, and became the historical tense. I have proposed, in the paper quoted above, the name of aorist-past for the permansive or preterit of the Hebrew, and aorist-present for the other tense, in imitation of the terms adopted by de Roug\u00e9 in his Egyptian Grammar. The permansive, as we know it in the late inscriptions, was not the one used in the early period, the first person in ku, and the third (this being the verbal theme in the masculine or feminine) may be the primitive forms, but the second person appears to be a later form introduced by Aramaean in-\nto the verbal noun, and was considered as forming only one word with it, the subject was placed after by the Pre-Akkadian Semites, as in Arabic and Hebrew; we have, therefore, such names as Igmil-Sin, Izkur-Ea, Ibni-Sin, etc. The nearly complete loss of the permansive in Babylonian and Assyrian is due, no doubt, to Akkadian influence. The preformatives of the aorist were, by false analogy, compared to the incorporated pronouns of the Akkadian verb, and this tense, being more easily understood by the Akkadian conquerors, was the one mostly used by the conquered Semites.\n\nThe force and origin of the suffixes of the permansive and of the prefixes of the aorist were lost at an early date, and that is not due to Akkadian influence, as the same thing happened in the cognate Arabic and Hebrew. We found, therefore, the pronominal suffixes of the accusative attached to the verb and followed by the noun subject:\n\n*etel-ka-Sin.*\n\nThe most important conclusion to which the study of these early proper names brings us is that the Babylonian Semites, before the arrival of the Akkadians, possessed already the fully-developed Semitic grammar: construct state and cases in the nouns as in Arabic, abstracts formed by the feminine suffixes, permansive, aorist and voices formed by affixes, etc., as in Hebrew and other cognate tongues. The difference with later Babylonian is indeed most trifling, as the use of the mimmation with the verb as in *tribam-Sin*, which is still noticed in the inscriptions of Hammurabi, and the use of *d* (perhaps !) by the side of *t* in the formation of abstracts, as in *sarla*, construct of *sarutu*.\n\nThere is, however, a peculiarity which would be of very great importance, if it could be established beyond doubt,\n\nfluence; the primitive forms of the permansive, which are composed by suffixing the personal possessive pronouns, must have been very similar to the aorist of Ethiopian.\n\n1 B. 42, l. 12; 53, l. 13, etc.\n2 The form *lulamar*, which we have seen above, is the precative of the secondary Shaphel voice or Istaphel.\nthat is, what appears to be the use of the feminine masculine in the third person of the permansive, we\n\n\\[ \\text{nabat kakka} \\] 'the star proclaims,'\n\nwhere the masculine noun in the nominative kakka to be the subject of nabat, third person fem. of the perf. of naba.\n\n\\[ \\text{midnat Sin} \\] 'Sin gave,'\n\nwhere the verb is also in the feminine. There are examples, but, as stated before, we have also the 3rd masc.; the use of the feminine would not, therefore, be exclusive, and these examples would only indicate a tendency.\n\nWas there, we may ask, in Mesopotamia, when the Akkadian arrived in it, an older population having a different conception, and under the influence of which tendency would have been developed? or are we to regard the result of an Akkadian influence, the Akkadian name as a sex-denoting language? or has it, after all, come from a natural decay, as in Egyptian?\n\nThere may be still another explanation. As we have seen, the permansive was not properly a tense, but the theme followed by the suffixes of the pronouns, the nouns in the genitive by position. Bani-Sin 'the creating' came to mean 'Sin created' only by development, which happened also in Egyptian. The 3rd person of the permansive, for the same reason, has no suffix, for the subject was, so to say, suffixed to the verb, and ought to be followed by a feminine noun as well as by a masculine noun. We find among the proper names, indeed, gamil-Gula may be considered as the 3rd pers. of a permansive, formed by means of suffixes with the noun as\n\n1 W.A.I. v. 46, l. 40. There exists in Syriac a feminine form of 'star,' but here the termination shows that we have a masculine word.\n2 B. 30, l. 24; 36, l. 24; 42, l. 29.\n3 On the other side, we have feminine noun with verb in the masculine Nana and Gamil-Gula.\n4 Strassmaier, No. 24, l. 23.\nmust have arisen in the Semitic tongues only when the notion of its formation had been lost, or perhaps also from the emphatic repetition of the subject.\\(^1\\) In early Babylonian, as in the other Semitic tongues, the abstract nouns were formed by the suffix \\textit{at}, which is also the suffix of the 3rd pers. fem. of the permansive. In the cases mentioned before we may have abstracts in the construct state, \\textit{nabat kakkabu}\\(^2\\) would be \u2018the proclamation or proclaiming of the star,\u2019 \\textit{nidnat-Sin} \u2018the gift or giving of Sin,\u2019 which carry to the mind exactly the same sense as the permansive.\n\nWhat, however, seems to contradict this explanation is the fact that in the proper names of the earliest commercial documents we often find names composed with the same elements, but reversed, as \\textit{Sin-turam}\\(^3\\) and \\textit{turam-ilia}\\(^4\\), \\textit{Gamil-Sin}\\(^5\\) and \\textit{Sin-Gamil}\\(^6\\), and also the same root as the aorist form \\textit{igmil-Sin};\\(^7\\) if \\textit{turam} and \\textit{gamil} are verbal forms, so are no doubt the forms in \\textit{at}.\n\nIf we now turn to the syllabary, we find a great many proofs of the priority of the Semitic civilization.\n\nIt has been said that the Cuneiform syllabary is very badly adapted to Assyrian, but the same may be said with still more reason as regards Akkadian; the vowels, for instance, which play an important part in this language, are often doubtful. When the Akkadian conquerors tried to apply to their language the system of writing, partly ideographic and partly phonetic, of their Semitic subjects, they had to modify and reform it in a certain measure. The ideograms were taken bodily, but read in accordance with the Akkadian vocabulary; these new pronunciations were taken as new phonetic values, though in many cases the Semitic value was retained; hence the polyphonism. In practice, however,\n\n\\(^1\\) In the Latin tongues, and especially in French, the subject is expressed in the same way, though the person is implied by the flexion.\n\n\\(^2\\) We should expect the genitive \\textit{kakkabi} in this case, though the Babylonians often neglected it; we find \\textit{Belit biri} and \\textit{Belit biru} \u2018the lady of Wisdom,\u2019 one of the names of Tasmetum.\n\n\\(^3\\) B. 24, l. 25.\n\n\\(^4\\) B. 55, l. 24.\n\n\\(^5\\) B. 52, l. 60; 95, l. 22.\n\n\\(^6\\) B. 97, l. 2.\n\n\\(^7\\) See above.\nall the values were not accepted by the two population remained exclusively Akkadian, and some exclusively S.\n\nIt may even be that at first there were two syllabaries, and that the phonetic values passed from syllabary into the other slowly, as words passed from vocabulary into the other.\n\nThe Akkadian scribes seem to have felt the need of precising more accurately the pronunciation of the words expressed by the ideograms. In a great many cases they gave the pronunciation inside or by the side of them, as:\n\n\\[ \\text{and} \\quad \\text{a-lim}.^1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{u-rn}.^2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{za for aza}.^3 \\]\n\nand a great many others.\n\nThis system of explaining the pronunciation of an ideogram by another group has been also resorted to by the Egyptian scribes; it is what is called phonetic determinatives.\n\nWhen the Akkadians had to borrow a Semitic word expressed by an ideogram, they felt more than ever the need of determining its pronunciation. For example, the word for 'price' \u0161imu in Assyrian passed into Akkad. The Akkadianized form is therefore written inside:\n\n\\[ \\text{a-lim}.^4 \\]\n\n---\n\n1. F. Lenormant has already pointed out this, and lays a great deal of stress upon it. Many values used in the Babylonian Semitic texts must have come from Sumerian, as they indicate the phonetic changes of the two dialects. It is perhaps, because the Semitic remnant took place when the Sumerians acquired the supremacy, and some of the phonetic peculiarities of Sumerian must be due to the Semitic influence.\n\n2. T. G. Pinches, *Archaic Forms of B. Characters*, in the Zeitschrift der Keilschriftforschung, vol. ii., p. 153. As the author here notices, the Babylonian texts give *\u0161imu*, written phonetically without the ideogram, that is, the phonetic peculiarities of Sumerian, which being a dialect has developed the phonetic peculiarities of Akkadian. In Sumerian texts, when the words are expressed by ideograms, they are to be read in their dialectical forms, and it is when the Babylonians adopted these ideograms that they introduced Sumerian phonetic peculiarities into their syllabary.\n\n3. W.A.I. i. 1, 99. The name of the character is *ugadhi* (W.A.I. ii. 1, 99), but as Prof. Sayce has noticed (S.B.A. vol. vii., p. 469), when the characters were classified and named, the Babylonians had lost all idea of their primitive form and origin.\n\n4. W.A.I. iii. 70, 82. No doubt such is also the origin of the ideogram for 'tongue' *cma* \\( \\text{a-lim} \\), that is \\( \\text{a-lim} \\) with \\( \\text{a} \\) inside, indicating the pronunciation.\n\n5. W.A.I. ii. 2, 335. This ideogram is of very common use in the cuneiform documents down to the latest period. I have been very careful not to regard the Semites as the inventors of writing, for I wish not to treat of this subject in detail.\nAll the pronunciations written in this way are Akkadian, which shows that the reform was done by the Akkadians; the Semites, however, adopted these signs so modified as mere ideograms, retaining the Akkadian explanations added to the primitive groups, no doubt to maintain terms understood by both populations.\n\nThere is a very interesting group, full of revelation; the ideogram for 'mother' \\( \\text{umu} \\) in Assyrian; the primitive Semite term was no doubt \\( \\text{ama} \\), preserved in the Hebrew \\( \\text{handmaid}' \\), triliteralized form of \\( \\text{ma} \\), which has been preserved in Egyptian. The Semites before the Akkadian invasion had the group \\( \\text{ma}^1 \\) for 'mother.' When the Akkadians adopted the writing, they wrote in the group the pronunciation of \\( \\text{an} \\) or \\( \\text{ana} \\), which was their term for 'mother,' thus: \\( \\text{ma}^2 \\) and \\( \\text{ma}^3 \\). The Semites adopted this reformed group as an ideogram; but the Semitic word was in course of time adopted by the Akkadians, so that the group remained with the phonetic determinative of a word, abandoned only as a witness of the reform of the syllabary. It might be objected that the Akkadians would not borrow such a word as 'mother,' but it is easily explained for the Akkadians, as all the successful invaders must have taken wives from the conquered population; the Semitic mother of the young Akkadians taught their children to call them \\( \\text{ama} \\) and not \\( \\text{ana} \\), so the word passed into Akkadian.\n\nThe priority of the Semitic knowledge of writing explains the Akkadian reversed reading of certain compound groups. The Semites, to give the ideographic idea of 'king,' formed\n\nnow, though there is evidence to show that they borrowed this art. When the Semites used it, they never reformed it, and till the latest period they employed the same cumbrous and ill-fitted syllabary.\n\n1 We have no example of the use of this group with the meaning of 'mother,' but we have no document of the early period in which it would have been in use.\n\n2 W.A.I. iv. 14, 24.\n\n3 Sayce's Syll. No. 147. In the early texts the phonetic complement is written outside, thus: \\( \\text{ma} \\).\n\n4 In our modern languages we see foreign words for other reasons taking the place of such fundamental native ones, as in English \\( \\text{papa} \\) for \\( \\text{dada} \\), the infantine appellation for 'father,' in French \\( \\text{bab\u00e9} \\), is now mostly used; this came through fashion. In Akkadian \\( \\text{ama} \\) was substituted for \\( \\text{ana} \\), because the mother's language is that of home, as the language of the priest is that of church; all the Mahomedan countries have for this reason adopted the word \\( \\text{Alla} \\) for 'God.'\nthe group \u1d48\u1e25- \u1d48\u1e25- \u1d48\u1e25-, analysed \u1d48\u1e25-, the sign for 'one,' the prince \u1d48\u1e25u, and \u1d48\u1e25- the sign for 'me.' When the Akkadians adopted the Babylonian syllables translated the two compounds according to their id order, not yet modified by Semitic influence, lu-gal chief'; but treating the compound group as a single ideogram they did not change the order of its two elements; out of this there always was from the earliest period a tendency to fuse the two characters into one, so that it became \u1d48\u1e25- at Nineveh, and \u1d48\u1e25- at Babylon.\n\nSo is to be also explained \u1d48\u1e25- \u1d48\u1e25- \u1d48\u1e25-, composed of 'chief,' and \u1d48\u1e25- 'assembly,' in Assyrian \u1d48\u1e25u. In Akkadian following this primitive ideological or 'assembly's chief' \u1d48\u1e25- \u1d48\u1e25- \u1d48\u1e25-, which became \u1d48\u1e25- \u1d48\u1e25- \u1d48\u1e25-, Assyrian by \u1d48\u1e25u \u1d48\u1e25- 'leader.' In the same way is to be also explained the other compound ideograms reversed reading.\n\nThe words or ideographical compound groups in parts of their elements, generally the second and third reversed, have, however, another origin, and proceed from the primitive system of arranging the groups together.\n\nThe earliest documents appear to have been written on narrow strips of papyrus, bark, or leaves, divided into columns containing two or three, rarely four, characters each, their width, the groups forming one expression, as \u1d48\u1e25- \u1d48\u1e25- \u1d48\u1e25-, 'my god so and so,' 'strong king,' 'I\n\n1 I give here the archaic form, which has preserved clearly the original elements.\n2 \u1d48\u1e25u means 'men' as a collective, for this reason it also translates \u1d48\u1e25u 'country.'\n3 W.A.I. ii. 2, 398.\n4 ibid. ii. 1, 126.\n5 There are few compounds in which the position of the elements in the word they must have been created by the Akkadian before they had the grammatical forms; these compounds represent ideas which did not exist among the languages previous to the Akkadian invasion.\n6 Sayce, Use of Papyrus, etc., S.B.A. Trans. vol. i. p. 342 et seq.; papyrus or other similar materials was kept at all periods (see Pinch Trans. vol. vi. p. 210). I take the opportunity to notice that the form of the characters depends very much on the material used. The linear characters traced on soft stones, as sand-stones, for instance, and are no proof of antiquity of the document. We find inscriptions of the same king written in linear and some in cuneiform characters.\netc., were separated by a line. This primitive arrangement was retained when other materials were used for writing, stone, clay, etc., though the new materials afforded the means of a better arrangement; so we see the cylinder of Gudea divided in these narrow columns, many words having to be divided when larger columns would have enabled the scribe to write easily the whole of the words in one line. The columns followed one another from top to bottom, and the divisions of each column from right to left, but the groups of characters in each division of the column were arranged rather irregularly, though always beginning in the right-hand top corner, the second character was placed either on the left of the first or under it. This margin left to the scribe has thrown a certain confusion in the grouping of characters. The following diagram will give an idea of these variations:\n\n| 2 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 1 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 3 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 3 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| 4 |   | 5 | 3 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 2 |   |   |\n\nCol. I.\n\n| 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 1 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 4 |   | 3 | 6 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 3 |   |   |\n\nCol. II.\n\n| etc. | 4 | 3 | 1 | 2 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n\nCol. III.\n\nSo we find in the early inscriptions, for instance:\n\n\\[ \\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{EV}^2 \\text{ and } \\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{EI}^3 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{EI} \\text{ EI} \\text{ EV} \\text{ EV} \\text{ EI} \\]\n\n1 The irregular arrangement of the characters in each division reminds us of the Maya system of writing, sometimes called calculiform writing. There was the same or still greater hesitation and incertitude as to the sequence of the various elements in each division. There was, however, it seems, a greater tendency to arrange the characters in columns in Cuneiform as in Egyptian, especially if their forms fitted to this arrangement; as for the name of Lagas (see above). It must be borne in mind that at a later time the Babylonian scribes altered their way of writing, so that the characters were placed on the side; therefore, the columns ran from left to right, and the groups followed one another also from left to right. It is thus that we print it in our quotations.\n\n2 Unpublished inscription, but this order is rare for this name.\n\n3 De Sarsee, D\u00e9couvertes en Chald\u00e9e, pl. 4, A; pl. 6, No. 4. It is the grouping mostly used no doubt because the characters fitted better in this order.\nThe following text is not legible due to handwriting style or resolution. It appears to contain paragraphs of text, possibly a narrative or essay, but the content is not discernible from the image provided.\nIt must also be granted that, if the Semites had adopted a syllabary already invented by the Akkadians, they would have either borrowed bodily the ideogram corresponding to the Akkadian gods, or would have written the name of theirs phonetically. This is not the case; the Semites, though they seem to have identified their gods with those of the Akkadians, have a different set of ideograms to represent them. The ideograms of the Akkadian gods can besides often be explained by the Akkadian phonetic reading of their components, and the names of the Semitic gods are rarely explained by reading the characters phonetically; but when it is so, the Semitic, not the Akkadian, value of the signs must be taken. In other cases the names are compound ideogrammatic groups.\n\nAs already noticed, many words passed from Akkadian into the Semitic Babylonian, and from the latter into the former. Many Akkadian words were borrowed at the earliest period, when they had not yet lost their ending in \\(ka\\), and before it had been weakened into \\(ga\\). On the other side, certain words which had no ideogram, because they expressed ideas unknown to the Semites, had to be written phonetically in Akkadian, as \\(pa-te-si\\).\n\nThe words borrowed by the Akkadians from their Semitic subjects indicate a more advanced state of civilization, like \\(stm\\) \u2018price,\u2019 \\(ma-na\\) \u2018a mine\u2019 or \u2018measure,\u2019 always written phonetically even in the earliest Akkadian texts, \\(amel\\) \u2018slave,\u2019 etc.\n\nBefore leaving the syllabary, another group of evidence\n\n---\n\n1 See S.B.A. Proceedings, vol. v. p. 20.\n2 The word is always written phonetically even in the inscriptions of Ur-Bau, and in the lineary inscriptions. It is a thorough Turanian word, representing an idea unknown to the Semites, and for which there was no ideogram in the Semitic hieroglyphic writing. From this word very likely came the eastern \\(padisha\\) (De Sarsec, D\u00e9es. en Chald\u00e9e, pl. 8; also pl. 6, No. 4, etc.).\n3 De Sarsec, pl. 8, inscription of the Ur-Bau, also in the lineary inscriptions in the B.M. 82-7-14.\n4 I have no doubt of the Semitic origin of this word, which meant a man as a worker. The word in Hebrew and Arabic has, as first vowel, the guttural \\(y\\), which is often represented in Babylonian by a simple vowel. I do not give any more examples, which would require too much space in order to prove by comparison that the words are really Semitic. Akkadists are too prone to admit that words have been borrowed from Akkadian.\nof the priority of the Semites in the knowledge of must be pointed out, that is, the very formative ideograms. The Akkadians brought with them the If they had invented the writing, they would have ideogram for such an important animal. This is not use the Babylonian sign for 'ass,' which denote many large quadrupeds, followed by the sign for 'The horse was therefore in their eyes the animal country par excellence. It is written in Babylonian\n\nThe sign for 'behind' represents the t and designates also the West, that is, the count the Semites left 'behind' when they arrived Mesopotamia.\n\nThis raises the interesting question of the ori the temples and other buildings. The orientation important part in all religions. If the Semites hception different from that of the Akkadians, they had a different orientation, and traces ought to be the monuments. In a note published several yea pointed out the difference of orientation of the old ment of Babylon, that is, the temple of Bel, des the classics, called by the Babylonians E-sagil, and of which are still designated by the Arabs under th Babil. The monuments in Babylonia are all bui the corners are all turned to the points of the comp only exception is this temple of Bel, the faces of opposed to the points of the compass; this is also th\n\n1 It may be that we have here another example of phonetic date the group gives the Akkadian pronunciation which was used till a very late date, sometimes without the prefix (vol. iv. p. 13, l. 8, 11, 16, 19, 20 and 23, and p. 14, etc.).\n\n2 S.R.A. Proceed., vol. v. p. 75. I will repeat here what I said was, I am afraid, mis-understood. The ancients had primitively no cardinal points as we understand them. The north, for instance, wa to which they could direct from several places their eyes, but a regi two people might have walked towards the north (mer-tum) though walking obliquely from one another. The more accurate n Egyptians as to the cardinal regions is due to the position of the ra they dwelt spreading from south to north, and the less accurate notion on account of the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates spreading west to south-east.\ntion of the Egyptian monuments. Though we must admit a different influence to explain the different orientation, we can hardly admit that of Egypt in a later time, for the temple of E-sagil is always designated by the Babylonians as the oldest temple; round it seems to be gathered the most ancient legends; it is in fact the starting-point from which the growing city developed, as Rome did from the Capitol. It is therefore likely, not to say certain, that this temple was built and orientated according to the Semitic notions before the arrival of the Akkadians. These barbarians, who knew no building but the huts in which they used to dwell, were struck by the height of the temple of Babel, and called it *e-sag-il* 'house of the high head.' During their long rule the name was adopted by the Semites; but from the traditions reported by the classics, it seems that an older name, 'Temple of Bell,' clung to it in the popular mind.\n\nThe Akkadian and Sumerian supremacy lasted such a long time that we cannot be surprised if the Babylonians had lost even the remembrance of the Semitic period of independence.\n\n1 The name of the citadel of Rome has a similar etymology to the Babylonian temple, *e-sag-il*. As for the name of Babylon itself, there are many explanations. Some follow the Jews, and take it from *Babel* 'confusion,' on account of the many languages spoken there; but this fact would prove that it is not primitive, as, if there were people of many languages in the town when it was named Babel, this name is not primitive. Others say that this name is a play on the name *Bab-ili* 'gate of God,' which is itself a translation of the Akkadian *Ka-dingir-ra-ki*. At the time of the second Ninevite empire and second Babylonian Semitic empire, we find *Ba-bi-ilu*, which might be read *Bab-ilani* 'gate of gods,' and the name phonetically spelt is *Ba-bi-ilu* or *Ba-bi-i-ti* or *Ba-bi-i-tam*. Sometimes the double *i* is not expressed, *Ba-bi-lu*, etc. Perhaps on account of the different spellings some argue that the Akkadian name is the translation of a Semitic expression, but only of the sounds, not of the meaning (as we have seen for *habaqrana*); but this does not explain the etymology of *Babel*. I will venture in adding two more explanations to the several already given. 1. *Ba* is the primitive Semitic word for 'house' (see Bertin, Origin of the Phoenician Alphabet, p. 12; it has been preserved in *baq* 'cavity, aperture, gate,' and in the preposition *ba*, see Gesenius's Dict.), and the god *par excellence* of the Semites was *Bel* 'the lord'; we have therefore *Ba-bel* 'the house of Bel,' as we have *baq* 'the house of Istar,' towns often taking for name that of the temple round which they grew (the etymology of *bab-bel* 'the door of Bel,' has been proposed long ago, see Gesenius Dict., sub voce). 2. It may be taken from the verb *babalu* 'to dispense,' with the idea of 'to benefit'; if applied to the temple, it would be the participle *babalu* 'the benefactor, the dispensing one.' We have *Babilat nukhi* as one of the names of the Tigris, on account of his bringing fecundity to the land (W.A.I. ii. 1, 26).\nbefore the Turanian invasion. At the time of the renaissance the scribes attributed everything to the Akkadians, and regarded them as their masters in every science and art. They borrowed Akkadian words wholesale. All the traditions were carried back and attributed to Akkadians, the names of the gods, the names of kings, and even many other thorough Semitic words, were translated by Akkadian. In other cases the Semitic words were translated into Akkadian badly Semiticized, or hybrid forms used in preference to the real Semitic words. Akkadian became the language of the learned Latin in the Middle Ages. Even at the highest point of the Semitic supremacy Nebuchadnezzar, in his inscriptions, affects to use Akkadian words in their oldest form. Akkadian expressions found in the texts of the Babylonian rulers, and as late as the reign of Seleucus we see the use of an imitation of the most ancient style of writing.\n\nSomething similar happened in England after the Conquest. The Normans, being in a minority, could not for a time impose their language, and little by little the Anglo-Saxon element came up again to the surface. Norman rule was, however, long enough to influence the language. At the renaissance of letters the scholars of the time, imbued with the classical literature, especially French had remained the court language, looked to Latin sources, even to explain the style of words: 'heir' was written with an h to assimilate Latin heres.\n\nWhat contributed, no doubt, to propagate the idea of the Akkadian origin of the Babylonian civilization was the transformation through which the Akkadians passed. When they appeared in Babylonia, they were barbarians; but, like the Goths in Italy and Spain, and the Franks in Gallia, they adopted the civilization of\n\n---\n\n1 The same thing happened in Egypt; but there it was a Semitic word which threatened the language of the Pharaohs. It became a Semitizing everything; if the word did not exist in the Semitic language, an Egyptian word was disfigured to give it a Semitic appearance (Histoire Ancienne, p. 337).\nquered population, with the changes necessary to suit their genius. Their kings encouraged science and literature; their and the Semitic legends and folklore were an inexhaustible mine exploited by the poets and artists; the traditions and religions of the two populations were assimilated or incorporated. It is difficult, if not impossible, for us to separate the two elements, as is the case with the Greek and Latin mythologies, so much mixed by the Roman poets that, with more documents than in the case of the Semitico-Akkadian legends, it requires all the criticism of modern science to extricate one from the other.\n\nThough we do not find bilingual inscriptions before Hammurabi, the Semitic language was not despised and excluded. We see the early poets writing works in the Semitic as well as in the Akkadian language, just as happened in England under the Norman kings when the same authors used to write in French as well as in English.\n\nThe Greek authors, who wrote about Assyria and Babylonia, never consulted the learned Babylonian scribes, but seem to have gathered their information from ignorant dragomans; these always gave the popular accounts and traditions, and we may find in these faint echoes of the first period. The Semites came into Mesopotamia, not through the Syrian Desert, but probably through the ordinary way of Northern Syria, the road of commerce at later times. They peopled, naturally, Assyria first, and after extended southward in the fertile regions of Babylonia; so it was related that Ninus founded Nineveh before the existence of Babylon. When the Semites had arrived at a certain degree of civilization, the barbarians, attracted by the wealth of this country, invaded it, and overran all Western Asia, from the Mediterranean Sea to the 'Mountains of the East.'\n\n1 An unpublished fragment of a tablet in the British Museum gives a portion of a list of classic authors, with the names of their works; these show that the same authors have written poems or relations in Akkadian and also in Semitic Babylonian. Prof. Sayce has, in the preface of the second edition of G. Smith's Chaldean Genesis, given a translation of the greatest part of this fragment.\n\n2 This name is the one given by the Babylonians to that mountain chain extending from Armenia to the east side of the Persian Gulf. It seems to mark the limit which the Semitic element never passed to settle in a permanent way.\nThese barbarians were called by the Akkadian convenient name of Sargones. But they could hardly be the strong chief mentioned by the Assyrians. Coming from the north, as their own traditions state, they crowded the Semitic Assyrians out. In the account, Ninus was placed over the Sargones, who represented the Semitic element. From this time the first who stood in the place of the Assyrians, he ruled for fifteen centuries.\n\nIn the Cuneiform inscriptions we find a king might be brought back to the same name, that of Sargon. As very lately shown by Mr. Firth, appears to have been a legend in Babylonia about a king named Sargon, who would re-establish and seize power of the country, as the legend of Arthur in England. Now, though we have Akkadana, i.e., the land of the Sargon, it has all the appearance of a Semitic non-historic King Sargon of Agade, or Agade was a city which was Sargon of Nineveh. Most probably the legendary Sargon was a Semitic king of the Pre-Akkadian period, or of the forgotten period of the Semitic race before the Akkadian invasion, who was destined, and who was expected as the signal of a Semitic restoration. The second Sargon who reigned at Agade was perhaps a\n\n1 A syllabary (W.A.I. ii. 7) gives for the name of Akkad, that is, Akkadana, repeated in the Akkadian reading on the Assur inscription, but an unpublished fragment in the B.M. gives the Assyrian name oldest form of ur 'strong,' sa 'strong,' twice repeated represent Gesenius, it is to be noticed, but not in the right combination of the group by ur in the Akkadian line and Akkad in the Semitic (S.B.A. Proc. vol. vii. p. 71).

This idea of a kind of Messiah prince is met with in a great many countries. The Syrians expect of the ancient king, who will re-establish the great Syrian Empire, Abyssinians, the Soudanese, etc.\n\n4 The reading is still uncertain. Sargon never calls himself king Akkad, but always of Ur. It is not proved that these names designate the same town; the presumption is the reverse.\nas the promised champion of the Semitic population; all his inscriptions are written in Semitic Babylonian, and in later times he was called the king par excellence. His reign is the turning-point in the dual civilization of Babylonia, and marks the beginning of the period in which the Semitic element regains power.\\(^1\\) For these reasons we may consider the inscriptions of Sargon of Agade as giving a fair idea of the system of writing of the Pre-Akkadian Semites: use of numerous ideograms with phonetic complements.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe Babylonian royal canon gives us also evidences of the priority of the Semites, if we analyze the meaning of the names. Though we do not possess this canon, but only one fragment published by G. Smith,\\(^3\\) it can be partly restored by means of the indications of Berosus, and the two lists published by Mr. Pinches.\\(^4\\)\n\nThis royal canon, the fragment of which was published by G. Smith, gave, it appears, the dates of the kings from the earliest period. We cannot unfortunately restore these dates, but we can at least reconstruct the great lines of the Babylonian history as written down by the Babylonians themselves. It can be divided provisionally into four long periods. The first or pre-diluvian period is known to us principally by the fragments of Berosus; the names of the ten kings which compose the dynasty have been shamefully mutilated, but a few of them have been preserved in the Cuneiform documents: these leave no doubt as to their Semitic origin.\n\nThe hero of the Flood is called by Berosus, according to his Greek copyists, Sisithros or Xisythros. This name is, as pointed out by G. Smith,\\(^5\\) found in the Flood-story of the Cuneiform inscriptions under the form of \\(\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\\).\n\n---\n\n1. The king Sargon seems to have extended his rule over the whole of Western Asia, from Elam to Syria, and all the neighbouring countries were paying tribute to him; he built at or near Babylon a town or citadel called Dur-Sargan.\n2. The texts of Sargon are principally known by Ninevite copies; in these the syntactic order is the same as in later times, being affected already by the Akkadian influence. The greatest part that has come down to us is astrological, for astrology was an especially Semitic science.\n3. S.B.A. Trans. vol. iii. p. 357.\n4.

But Berosus, or his Greek copyists, have another mistake. Atra-has is not the Babylonia but a god who acts as messenger of Ea to him; at any name is undoubtedly Semitic. The name of the hero flood is written in the Babylonian document \\( \\text{I} \\) two ideograms with phonetic complement; that is should expect for a pre-Akkadian Semitic name; it by Dr. Delitzsch Pir-napistim, 'the offspring of' more correctly by Mr. Pinches Um-napistim 'day.'

However, Daonos, the sixth antediluvian king, is no doubt *dainu* 'the judge' in Assyrian.\n\nOf the second period we know only a few names given in the oldest list of the British Museum, and from the remark of the scribe its chronology seems to have been uncertain. The names preserved are some Semitic, some Akkadian; it is probably the period of establishment of the Akkadian invaders; the old Sargon is in this period.\n\nThe third period is subdivided into three epochs: the first contains almost exclusively Kassite names; the second epoch contains three series of names, Sumerian, then Akkadian and Sumerian again; the third epoch gives a new line of Kassite kings. This is the period of the Akkadian and Sumerian supremacy, interrupted twice by a Kassite conquest.\n\nThe succession of the names explains clearly the course of events. The first Kassite dynasty was overthrown by an Akkadian population of Southern Babylonia, called by the Assyrians Sumer, and speaking a dialect less pure than\n\n---\n\n1 The Greek transcriptions of the names known to us show what we may expect: *aparanadios* for *asur-nadin*, *saosduchinos* for *Samas-sumu-ukin*, etc. Smith's assimilation (S.B.A. Trans. vol. v. p. 353) of *E\u0161\u0161u\u0161* *E\u0161\u0161u\u0161* *E\u0161\u0161u\u0161*, which he read *amil-uru-gal* with the fifth king *megalaros*, comes from an error, this group being an ideogram of the name of a priest or religious officer, not a proper name. The name of the fifth antediluvian king is besides read also *megalaros* et *metalarios*. Some names suggest no doubt Assyrian ones, but it is difficult to reconstruct them. In *Euedoreschos* or *Euedorachos* we may detect for instance the name of Merodak, as in *Ilovardam* for *Emil-Merodak*; but the whole name escapes us. Sargon of Nineveh gives the name of the first Babylonian king as *a-di-i-D.P.* ur 'my covenant (is) of Ur,' (the god Ur is the Moon-god), which is also a Semitic name, and in this King Adi-Ur we have perhaps the original name of the first king of Berosus *Aopos* for *Aopos*. This name, 'my covenant is of the Moon God,' is very appropriate for the first king, who, according to the legend, was chosen by God to instruct and conduct the Babylonians. The names of Annedotos or Oannes and his successors Euedokos (Merodak?), Eneubulos, etc., seem also to be Semitic.\n\n2 The series of names are, in the tablet, interrupted by several gaps, the ends and beginnings of the columns being lost. In one of them must be placed Sargon of Agade. To this period must also belong the hero Gisdubar (this reading is still uncertain), who slew the foreign tyrant Humbaba. It is probable that the Kassite conquest contributed largely to weaken the Akkadian and Sumerian element, and hastened the return of the Semitic supremacy.\n\n3 This name, as that of Akkad, is Semitic, and means 'guardian' (there are a great many places called so in the Bible); it answers to the old word 'march' in\nTHE PRE-AKKADIAN SEMITES.\n\nAkkadian proper. After this first Sumerian dynastic restoration, that is, return of the supremacy, of that population which had preserved its purer language; then the Sumerians, or the Southern Semites, came to power again till the second Kassite dynasty. We might find in this succession of rules the explanation of another classical legend. The Akkadians were, in fact, related to the inhabitants of Northern Babylonia, because the purer dialect was maintained there for this reason, the informers of the Greeks represented them as the people of Akkad (confusing the Akkadian name with the Akkadian word).\n\nEnglish, and designated the borderland, and especially that on the north-western portion bordering on what was Babylonian. The compound ideogram which represents this word is \\( \\text{\u0161e} \\)-\\( \\text{\u0161u} \\)-\\( \\text{\u0161a} \\); but we have no syllabary giving its pronunciation. This group may be, after all, a compound ideogram to express the population of the marshy country at the mouth of the Euphrates. \\( \\text{\u0161e} \\) is 'place,' \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\) 'lord,' sometimes replaced by \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\), same meaning, and \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\) 'reed.' Sumer would therefore be the 'place of the lord of the reed.' It would be, in fact, the 'lowland,' in opposition to the 'highland,' though the primitive meaning of the latter is still preserved in the character, as \\( \\text{sir-gal-la} \\) is pronounced \\( \\text{lega} \\).\n\nThis proves the co-existence of the two populations and their vocabulary gives us also many proofs. The Akkadian texts have \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\), form, instead of \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\) (change of \\( \\text{\u0161} \\) into \\( \\text{\u0161} \\)), which must have been borrowed from the southern population (Kinches, Academy, 1882, July 22). The Tigris gives us another striking example. It is written by means of compound ideograms \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\) and \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\); the first is read \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\) as is well known; together they are read \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\) (W.A.I. iii. 70, 46) or \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\) (ibid. iv. 12, 7) in Assyrian, by the Hebrew \\( \\text{Hadderek} \\), Aram. \\( \\text{diglat} \\), Syr. \\( \\text{diglat} \\); it shows the river to be in Akkadian \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\), and if we found \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\) as the name which the Semitic name is borrowed, it is that the Sumerian or dialect has changed \\( \\text{\u0161} \\) into \\( \\text{\u0161} \\), but not yet \\( \\text{\u0161} \\) into \\( \\text{\u0161} \\). The full dialectic form is \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\) (ibid. iii. 70, 47), and translated \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\) (also in a text iv. 5, 61-62), the \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\) (cf. \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\)) 'to shine,' 'to be light,' consequently 'to make a river to be light,' that is, 'to pour forth light.' The Tigris is the river shining or bright. This explanation has escaped Dr. Delitzsch, who has not taken into account the meaning of the second compound \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\) (WO leg das Paradies, p. 170-172); but he is right when he explains given by the classics (Pliny vi. 127, Quintus Curtius iv. 14, 8) is a folk-etymology of the Persian period. The \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\) under the Aryan influence changed into \\( \\text{\u0161} \\), we have the old Persian \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\), \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\), a name used for the river at the time when came in contact with the people of Mesopotamia. The form \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\) is the inscription of Darius (W.A.I. iii. 35, 35), is the Aramaean form of the Persian derived the name \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\).

During the long struggle against the Kassite sway, the Akkadians and Sumerians had been considered as the champions of Babylonian independence, with this difference: the Akkadians were the instructors and teachers of all, and their dialect was taken as the classic tongue; the Sumerians, who had twice broken the Kassite power, were considered as politically superior, and for this reason the early kings put Sumer first.\\(^3\\) Under Hammurabi, the sixth king of the first dynasty, Akkadian is the official language; but the translation in Semitic Babylonian is given by the side of it, and many of the private contracts are entirely written in the Semitic dialect.\n\nI cannot here refrain from noticing the folly of a certain school of Semitic scholars, who, through a rather too exclusive enthusiasm, will not admit the possibility of the Babylonian Semites having received their civilization from\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) It may be argued that the explanation is too ingenious to be true; but all the other explanations brought forward till now have failed to satisfy all the points. Some have assimilated the legendary queen to Istar, without much ground; others to Hammurabi with only a faint similarity of sound; others to Sammuramat, the wife of Rimam-Nirari, King of Nineveh; but this queen never ruled at Babylon, much less built it. This name, besides, does not correspond to that of the classics; it would have become in Greek either Samoramitis, the Greek adding always the termination to the foreign name, as in Belia from Beltu, or Amoramitis, the Greek dropping the initial s, as Arkeanos for Sargon.\n\n\\(^2\\) A strong Kassite party maintained itself still for a long time in Babylonia, and they gave a long dynasty. The Kassite power seems to have been entirely broken down only by the Ninevites.\n\n\\(^3\\) They call themselves 'King of Sumer and Akkad.'\nTHE PRE-AKKADIAN SEMITES.\n\na Turanian population, and had therefore to suppo-\ndian, Sumerian, Kassite, etc., to be as many secre-\nof writing.\u00b9 If they had only waited without pre-\nideas the progress of science, they would have so\nthe Babylonian Semites were in possession, before t\ndian invasion, of the art of writing and the first\nof civilization.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n\nAt a very remote date, impossible now to determ\napproximately, a numerous tribe of Semites, having\nfirst home in passing through Northern Syria, to\nbecame in later times the route of commerce, and\nAssyria, and from there advanced into the fertile ;\nMesopotamia and Southern Babylonia, where th\naccording to some, a negroid population, which was\nor exterminated.

The population was divided into small tribes, having each its king or chief. A Turanian tribe, the Uri or Akkadians, inhabiting the North-Eastern frontier, attracted by the wealth of Babylonia, made a sudden irruption, and easily overran the whole of the country, ill-organized for resistance; but they soon adopted the civilization of the conquered race, and, after a reform, adapted the system of writing to their own language. The Akkadian kings encouraged the literary spirit of their subjects; the two races were little by little intimately united their religions, their traditions, and their legends were assimilated or fused in one another. During this period of fusion the languages of the two races exercised a strong influence on one another, to the extent of bringing two opposed syntactical orders to one common one. A Kassite invasion, and a long period of foreign kings, contributed to cement the union of the two races. The Akkadians were, even by the Semites themselves, considered as the natural masters of the country, as the civilizers, legislators, and teachers of every science and art. A branch of the Akkadian nation, the Sumerians, overthrew the Kassite yoke; but the struggle with the Kassites continued during an Akkadian and a second Sumerian dynasty, and the Kassites succeeded in the end. In this long struggle the Akkado-Sumerian population seem to have been worn out, and the Semitic element reappeared, took the lead, and remained prevalent till the destruction of the Babylonian Empire.\nART. XVIII.\u2014The Arrangement of the Hymns of Granth. By Frederic Pincott, M.R.A.S.\n\nExactly two years ago it was my good fortune to lay this Society my discovery of the system on which the hymns of the Rig-Veda were arranged,\u2014a discovery of the utmost interest to the student of the Vedas, not only by throwing unexpected light on ancient philosophical theology; but by bringing back to the world the Liturgy of the ancient Brahmins, knowledge of the true character of which had been lost in India itself, for about 3000 years. Again I appear before you in the character of Veda-Vyasa, in order to lay before you the system on which the hymns of the Adi Granth are arranged.\n\nSpecial difficulties have presented themselves in the attempt at this task from the fact that the Adi Granth contains 3384 hymns or considerably more than three times the bulk of the Rig-Veda; and also from the circumstance that the system followed by the writers of the Granth appears to have been forgotten by the Sikhs themselves. Dr. Trumpp made earnest inquiries into this subject, and he says: \"The Sikhs themselves seem now to have lost all knowledge of the metrical laws of the Granth, for I never met a Sikh who could give me the least clue to them.\" Not only are the metrical laws apparently lost, but the entire system on which the Adi Granth was arranged is also unknown. I need only cite the following words of the learned Dr. Trumpp, whose statement must be accepted as correct. After giving a list of the R\u00e2gs into which the hymns are divided, he says, \"The verses of the different Guru...\"\nbeen distributed into these fore-mentioned R\u00e2gs, apparently without any leading principle, as hardly any verse is internally connected with another. The name of the R\u00e2g is, therefore, a mere superscription, without any reference to its contents. . . . No system or order is, therefore, to be looked for in any of the R\u00e2gs. In the first four R\u00e2gs the most important matter was collected, and they are, therefore, also comparatively of the largest compass; the following minor R\u00e2gs seem to be a second gathering or gleaning, as materials offered themselves, no attention being paid to the contents, but only to the bulky size of the Granth. By thus jumbling together whatever came to hand, without any judicious selection, the Granth has become an exceedingly incoherent and wearisome book.\"\u00b9 This is sufficient to show that Dr. Trumpp had no inkling of the system on which the book was arranged; and if the able translator of the text, who spent many years in its study, considered the Adi Granth to be a mere promiscuous heap of verses, it is safe to conclude that the principles on which the book is arranged are quite unknown.\n\nI shall now proceed to show that the book is arranged on a definite plan from end to end, that it does not consist of two or more \"gatherings or gleanings,\" that each hymn is placed where we find it in accordance with fixed principles; and hence it follows that the latter portion of the book, which Dr. Trumpp did not translate, is just as important as the earlier portion which he did translate. It is not generally known that the Translation we possess gives little more than one-third of the entire book. The Adi-Granth contains 15,575 stanzas, of which Dr. Trumpp has translated 5,719; and of these all but 472 stanzas occur at the beginning of the book, where they were placed, not from any specially interesting characteristics of their own, or because they were a first gleaning, or considered older, or more genuine; but simply because they properly fell into that position according to the principle on which the book was arranged.\n\n\u00b9 Translation of the Adi Granth, Introduction, p. cxx.\nARRANGEMENT OF THE ADI GRANTH.\n\nThe Adi Granth is divisible into three parts, the first of which is liturgical, the second contains the general hymns, and the third part is supplementary, consisting of heterogeneous matter which could not well be included in the former portions. The Sikhs are fully aware of the distribution of the contents of the Adi Granth. They know that the first part contains the Jap-j\u00ee, or general creed of faith, together with selections from the body of hymns to be used at evening-prayer, etc.; the second part is to consist of different clusters of hymns sung to various R\u00e2gs or tunes; and the last part is named the Bhog, because it comprises certain panegyrics on the Gurus. This arrangement it will be seen accords with that of the Rig-Veda; the first Mandala of which is likewise followed by various sets of hymns, and ending with long and short hymns, or miscellaneous collection.\n\nThe liturgical portion of the Adi Granth requires no explanation. It begins with the confession of faith, credo, and ends with the prayers offered before rest at night. The R\u00e2gs which follow are more confused in their arrangement. Their order depends on the system of India, of which, unfortunately, I have very little knowledge; but I can state sufficient to show that the arrangement is methodical.\n\nThe characteristic peculiarity of Indian music is based on the theory that each musical sound corresponds to some emotion of the human heart. When any particular sound predominates in a tune, that tune is supposed to rise to a peculiar R\u00e2g, or emotion; hence it follows that there can be as many R\u00e2gs as there are musical notes. The number of R\u00e2gs in Sanskrit treatises, is, however, uncertain, there being generally reckoned six primary R\u00e2gs, which has five (sometimes said to be six) assistants, and eight subordinate R\u00e2gs. This would give a total of 90 R\u00e2gs and R\u00e2ginis; but the Sangita-P\u00e2rij\u00e2ta lists no less than 122 species. In modern Indian music, was, probably, the only kind of music known to the editors of the Granth) there are about 32 R\u00e2gs, and each\nsidered specially applicable to some season of the year, or some time of the day. With the minuteness of detail which characterizes Indian science, the day is divided into numerous portions, providing accommodation for R\u00e2gs applicable to midnight, early morning, sunrise, etc., etc., down to evening and night again.\n\nNow, the Indians divide the full day into 8 pahars, each of which contains 8 gh\u00e2rs, giving a total of 64 gh\u00e2rs for the entire day. If we allow 2 gh\u00e2rs for every R\u00e2g, we get 32 R\u00e2gs, just the number which modern Indians consider necessary. It happens, however, that the Adi Granth contains 30 or 31 R\u00e2gs; the doubt as to the number arising from the fact that, after the book had been arranged by the Fifth Guru, Arjun, the Ninth Guru, Tegh Bah\u00e2dur, composed four hymns in a peculiar strain, which have been classed as a separate R\u00e2g and inserted, sometimes in the middle of the book, and sometimes at the end. This R\u00e2g is named Jaij\u00e2vanti, and the authorities accessible are evenly divided as to its position, there being four\\(^1\\) which insert it as the 12th R\u00e2g, and four\\(^2\\) which place it at the end. This, taken in connection with the fact that this R\u00e2g was composed long after the Adi Granth was originally arranged, is sufficient to show that it is in the nature of an excrescence. Still it deserves remark that if the day be divided into 32 portions of 2 gh\u00e2rs each, there will be 31 points of division; and the 31 R\u00e2gs which the Adi Granth contains would provide a separate R\u00e2g for each such period of the 24 hours.\n\nIf we consider the 30 R\u00e2gs, which must have been the entire number dealt with by Guru Arjun, we find that they exactly correspond with the 30 semitones of the Indian stabaka, or musical staff, reckoning the minor intervals as single tones. There are nine major tones on the stabaka each divisible into semitones, or 18 half-notes; there are also six natural semitones, and six natural minors; making\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) India Office MSS. 2477, 2483, 2484, and British Museum MS.

Or. 1125; Addit. 25,680.\nARRANGEMENT OF THE ADI GRANTH.\n\na total of 30 tones, each of which might form the basis of a special R\u0101g.\u00b9\n\nIt would seem from the foregoing that, as the book was arranged by Guru Arjun, the Adi Granth had a system of poems for every musical semitone of the staba\u010d. It can be no doubt that the basis of arrangement was laid down for directions as to the tunes and the keys in which the poems are to be sung occur throughout. There is not a hymn in the book unaccompanied by musical notes; as will be shown further on when setting forth the arrangement of the individual hymns. Furthermore we learn from the biographies of the Gurus that their poems were always sung to an accompaniment of the rab\u0101b.\n\nThe character of each R\u0101g depends upon the predominance of some particular note, technically called the anb\u0101 (\u0906\u0901\u092c\u093e) from which two other notes are deduced, called the ny\u0101sa (\u0928\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938) or inceptive, and the ny\u0101sa (\u0928\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938) or close note. These three notes forcibly remind us of the major, subdominant, and tonic, of Europe. The anb\u0101 or predominant influence over any melody played in the R\u0101g in which it governed; for it must be remembered that a R\u0101g is not a tune, but a tune dominated by a particular note. Every tune governed by the same note is in the same R\u0101g, and this explains the fact that poems of various metres are found classed under the same R\u0101g in the Adi Granth.\n\nThe order in which the R\u0101gs occur in the Granth is probably depends on musical laws at present unknown, but there are verses in the book itself which prove that the arrangement is methodical. In the very first verse at the end of the First Book, Guru Amar-D\u0101s says, \u091c\u093f\u0924\u0947 \u0928\u093e\u092e \u0930\u093e\u0917 \u091a\u0940 \u0938\u093f\u0930\u093f \u0930\u093e\u0917 \u0939\u0948\u0902, \"Amongst all the R\u0101gs the Siri R\u0101g is chief.\" This was written before the book was compiled, and it satisfactorily accounts for the high position accorded to the Siri R\u0101g. The last poem in the book also repeats the assertion that the Siri R\u0101g is chief.\n\n\u00b9 In this calculation I omit the \u015brut\u0101, or quarter-notes, and treat them as being too minute to serve as bases for separate R\u0101gs. They make a total of 66 intervals.\nof the R\u00e2gs. It is followed by the R\u00e2g called Majh, or Middle; and then comes the Gaur\u00ee, or R\u00e2g peculiar to the evening. The first three R\u00e2gs may then represent morning, mid-day, and evening. Towards the end of the Granth a similar indication of method is observable; for the R\u00e2gs Bhairau, Basantu, S\u00e2rang, and Mal\u00e2r, follow each other in succession; and these R\u00e2gs are held to be respectively appropriate to Autumn, Spring, Summer, and the Rains.\n\nThe reason for the order in which the R\u00e2gs are found is not so apparent as that which regulates the order of the hymns themselves. Here, happily, we are on solid ground; and whatever may be thought of the foregoing speculations on the R\u00e2gs, there can be no doubt about the principles on which the poems themselves are classified. The hymns which are to be sung in a particular R\u00e2g were first placed together; and were then arranged under the following heads:\n\n1. Chaupad\u00fbs, containing an average of four verses each.\n2. Astpad\u00fbs, containing an average of eight verses each.\n3. Special long poems.\n4. Chhants, consisting of 6-line verses.\n5. Special short poems.\n6. V\u00e2rs, consisting of two or more Sloks, and a Paur\u00ee, or concluding stanza.\n7. Poems of the Bhagats, or Saints.\n\nThere is absolutely no deviation from this clearly-defined principle, as will be seen by the following analysis of the R\u00e2ga. All the R\u00e2gs do not contain the whole of these kinds of versification; but, whether short or long, whatever they do contain, is invariably arranged on this system.\n\nUnder the foregoing seven heads the poems are yet further classified according to their authorship; the poems of the Gurus being placed first in chronological sequence, followed by those of the Bhagats, according to a tolerably well-defined order of precedence, in which all the Hind\u00fb writers come before the Muhammadan faq\u00eer Shekh Far\u00eed; who is only followed by the solitary female composer Mir\u00ee B\u00e2\u00ee.\nARRANGEMENT OF THE ADI GRANTH.\n\nThe following is a list of the authors comprising the R\u00e2ga, in their order of precedence:\n\n1. The First Guru.\n2. The Second Guru.\n3. The Third Guru.\n4. The Fourth Guru.\n5. The Fifth Guru.\n6. The Ninth Guru.\n7. The Tenth Guru.\n8. Kabir.\n9. N\u00e2mdev.\n10. Ravidas.\n11. Trilochan.\n12. Benl.\n13. Jaidev.\n14. Bh\u00eekhan.\n15. Sadhn\u00e2.\n16. Saiju.\n17. Dhann\u00e2.\n18. Param\u00e2nand.\n19. Surd\u00e2s.\n20. Pip\u00e2.\n21. Shekh Farid.\n22. Miri B\u00e2l.\n\nThe general Table of the contents of the R\u00e2ga follows shows that, however many or few of these authors are represented in a R\u00e2g, they invariably occur in the same order.\n\nThe hymns having been collected under their appropriate R\u00e2ga, and separated into chaupadd\u00e2s, antpadde, etc., were yet further classified according to the gharu, or clef, in which each hymn was to be sung. According to the Indian method of singing, the accent falls, and then rises and falls, in different positions, according to the gharu, which the verses are sung. It is needless to dwell further; for my object is simply to show how the hymns are arranged on a definite system; and these remarks will enable any one to understand the following list of the contents of the entire Adi Granth, which gives the hymns in the order in which they occur in the book. This list gives the R\u00e2g, the nature of the hymn, the gharu, the number of the hymns, and the number of verses contained in each cluster. A simple inspection of this list (now that its principle is explained) will show that part of the Adi Granth is arranged methodically. This list will also indicate where the compositions of certain poets can be found in the book. It is of considerable importance.\nfor a correct appreciation of the development of any faith to read the statements of its founders in the chronological order of the writers; and this list will enable the student readily to pick out the passages ascribed to any particular author from any part of the *Adi Granth*.\n\n**Table of Contents of the Adi Granth.**\n\n*Liturgical.*\n\n1. *Japu*, by

Bhagats, Sloks in excess of V\u0101rs, that is to say, Sloks which have not been worked up into V\u0101rs by the addition of Paur\u012bs; also Saveyais or Panegyrics on the various Gurus; ending with a R\u0101g\u0101 M\u0101l\u0101, and a few unclassified fragments. It must be mentioned that the last cluster of 19 Sloks, the Ratan M\u0101l\u0101, and the story of Rai Muk\u0101m, are held to be of doubtful canonical authority, and are not included in all copies of the Adi Granth.\n\nThe following list collects the totals in the foregoing tabular statement; and it shows at a glance the amount which each writer contributed to the book. The Fifth Guru Arjun was the collector and arranger of the Adi Granth; and we see from this list that he actually himself wrote nearly half the book he was engaged on arranging.\n### ARRANGEMENT OF THE ADI GRANTH.\n\n| Author                  | No. of Stanzas |\n|-------------------------|----------------|\n| Fifth Guru              | 6204           |\n| First Guru              | 2949 (including) |\n| Third Guru              | 2522           |\n| Fourth Guru             | 1730           |\n| Kabir                   | 1146           |\n| Namdev                  | 239            |\n| Ninth Guru              | 196            |\n| Shekh Farid             | 149            |\n| Ravidas                 | 134            |\n| Second Guru             | 57             |\n| Trilochan               | 20             |\n| Beni                    | 19             |\n| Dhann\u00e2                  | 13             |\n| Rai Balvandi            | 8              |\n| Jaidev                  | 7              |\n| Bhikh\u00e2n                 | 5              |\n| Sainu                   | 4              |\n| Sadhn\u00e2                  | 4              |\n| Surdas                  | 4              |\n| Mardan\u00e2                 | 3              |\n| Paramanand              | 3              |\n| Mir\u00ee B\u00e2\u00ee                | 3              |\n| Pip\u00e2                    | 2              |\n| Tenth Guru              | 1              |\n| Various Bha\u1e6d\u1e6ds          | 122            |\n| Unnamed Bhagat at end of R\u00e2g Jaitari | 6 |\n| R\u00e2g M\u00e2l\u00e2, etc.          | 25             |\n\nTotal stanzas 15,575\n\nThe orderly statement of the contents of the *Adi Granth* given in this paper conclusively proves that the hymns are arranged on a clearly traceable system, depending on the tunes to which the poems were sung; secondly, on the nature or metre of the poems themselves; thirdly, on their authorship; and, fourthly, on the clef or key appropriate to them. It follows, as a corollary, that the positions of the hymns have no reference to their religious or dogmatic importance; and, also, that the *Adi Granth* is not a single systematic collection, into which the later additions (chiefly those of the Ninth and Tenth Gurus) were inserted in appropriate places.\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\nIt is proposed to commence, from the 1st October, a paper under this head, at the conclusion of each number of the Journal. Its object will be:\n\n1. To report the Society's meetings, papers read, and any discussions which may ensue. Such papers as are published in the Journal \\textit{in extenso} will be very briefly summarized.\n\n2. To supply an abstract of the Proceedings of Foreign and Branch Societies on matters within the legitimate province of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n3. To publish letters or notes from correspondents conveying information, making inquiries, or correcting errors.\n\n4. To supply a list of books in all languages on subjects coming within the scope of the Society, reviewing such as appear to merit special notice.\n\n5. To give currency to miscellaneous information which would naturally interest our Members, whether in the form of extracts, notices, or otherwise.\n\nAdvantage is taken of the space provided in the present number by this announcement to enter three communications received during the past quarter. One is from our late President; the second from Mr. Sidney Churchill, at Tehran: the third from our Member and contributor, Dr. Theodore Duka.\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\n1.

J.\n\nThe Secretary, Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n2. The Alchemist.\n\nNote.\u2014Mr. Sidney Churchill has favoured the Society with a note on Mr. Guy Le Strange's translation of the above which appeared in the Journal, Vol. XVIII. Part I. for, 1886. After conveying his assurance that M\u00edrz\u00e1 Kar\u00e1jed\u00e1gh\u00ed is living, and has verbally expressed his belief that he is not the inheritor of the fortune attributed to him, he gives the M\u00edrz\u00e1's own account of his relations with Akh\u00fandz\u00e1deh, M\u00edrz\u00e1 Fath '\u00c1li. He (the M\u00edrz\u00e1) was fortunate enough to make his acquaintance, but, by correspondence with him, discovered that he was not only a native of Kar\u00e1jed\u00e1gh, but a relative of his own. Mr. Churchill adds:\n\n\"M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ja'far is\u2014according to his own statement\u2014about fifty-four years of age. Some years ago he was in the employ of Jel\u00e1l-ud-D\u00edn M\u00edrz\u00e1, author of Persian history called 'N\u00e1meh Khusrav\u00e1n.' W.\"\n\n1 M. Barbier de Meynard, in his Preface to the \"Trois Com\u00e9diens,\" in Paris this year, mentions the authority on which he also accepts the translation given to Mr. Guy Le Strange.\nhistory was completed and lithographed, copies were presented to different friends of its author. One of these\u2014perhaps only by reputation\u2014was the Akh\u00fandz\u00e1deh. A copy was sent to him, and in return he presented the prince with a copy of his plays, expressing the hope\u2014on the lining paper inside the copy\u2014that it would be found interesting enough to be translated into Persian. For a long time this little book lay unnoticed in a niche, until one day, by some chance, M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ja\u2019far got hold of it. Charmed with the perusal of it, he determined to put into execution the author\u2019s wish that a Persian version of it should be made. \u2018The Alchemist\u2019 was the first piece he attempted. On its completion, he showed it to the prince, who was so pleased with it that he urged on him the translation of the remaining plays. Eventually the translation was finished, and the whole was lithographed at odd times, as will be noticed by the dates borne by the several pieces. The translator was considerably out of pocket by the whole affair. His patron died, and for some years he wandered about from one post to another, never getting a permanent berth anywhere. For a little over two years he has been entirely without employ, living retired, unknown and unheeded, fretting away the remainder of his life in sorrow at the thought that what he considered a great educational, and, to his countrymen, a universally beneficial work, has been too often rejected and doomed to oblivion by them.\n\n\u201cThe Akh\u00fandz\u00e1deh, in his correspondence with M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ja\u2019far thoroughly approved of the translation, and entirely shared the translator\u2019s ideas regarding their purpose of exposing pernicious customs and elevating the vulgar intellect to a higher standard.\n\n\u201cM\u00edrz\u00e1 Ja\u2019far has two hobbies: the one of which is the r\u00f4le that the drama bears as an agent in civilization; the other is to do away with the present system of elementary education, whereby, after a child has been taught his letters, he is made to read the Kor\u00e1n for some years, thereby losing all opportunity of getting at a sound knowledge of his own language. He is convinced that the child should first learn his alphabet, and then read some of the very elementary reading books\nlately published at Tehran, after which he would some of the plays or some other entirely Persian work second pet notion of his he has wedded to his only companion, a little girl, left alone in the world with to cheer his waning years.\n\n\"As to the English translation, I would make one it is that the word \u0645\u0646\u0627\u062a man\u00e1t is the Persian na rouble.\n\n\"SIDNEY J. A. CHUR\n\n\"Tehran, March, 1886.\"\n\n3. NOTE ON THE TURKO-TAT\u00c1R AND FINN-UGIC CONTROVERSY.\n\nIn connection with, and as a supplement to his gr on \"The Ethnology and Ethnography of the Turkis published by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Professor Arminius Vamb\u00e9ry gave a discourse on this year, at the annual meeting of that scientific bod excited great interest. The occasion afforded an oppo to the opponents of his teaching, of which they readily themselves, to protest against his conclusions. interest the readers of the Royal Asiatic Society's Jo obtain a short resum\u00e9 of the proceedings at Budap\n\nProfessor Vamb\u00e9ry maintains that \"all the ancient regarding the origin of the Magyar\" nation are mistaken assumptions, because the propounders of to connect it with tribes which either never existed at best played a very subordinate part in the eventi of those nations located between the Altai Moun the Karpathians. He asserts, moreover, that, obtaining from such studies the light that might expected to clear up the dark ages of history, the si become more than ever clouded in confusion and un To quote his own words, \"It is only at the present that the veil has been lifted, thanks to the assistance obtained from the study of ethnography, history, ge and philology. The fatal mistake consists in this, th\nthe search after the origin of the Hungarian nation it was assumed that the language of the present day was the only true criterion to guide us. Yet we ought to know that the spoken language of a nation passes through greater changes than does its physical character. We cannot indeed sufficiently deplore that, in setting up such an a priori philological argument, the eyes of a certain class of investigators should be closed to all other arguments. Having thus set aside the lessons of anthropology, psychology and ethnology, they have preserved to us the Hungarian ancestors and their deeds, migrations, and fundamental national characteristics, under an entirely false aspect.\"\n\nProfessor Vamb\u00e9ry further declares that his mode of inquiry into this important subject differs in toto from those hitherto pursued. He starts with the proposition that the study of the question should be commenced at a period when the Hungarians first moved from their original home, which was on the slopes of the Altai Mountains. Commencing with those prehistoric times, the mighty wave of the Turco-Tartar migration subdued the Finnish-Ugric elements, which at that time had also their home there, and drove them to the north-east and the north-west. From the period of this important ethnographic revolution, which effected manifold admixtures between Turkish and Ugric elements, Professor Vamb\u00e9ry dates the origin of the \"Magyar\" nation, and, owing to the moral and physical advantages thus acquired, and always observed in cross-breeds, he considers that the Magyar element assumed a more favoured position than that of the sister nations which remained purely Turkish.\n\nSpace will not admit of a full analysis of the Professor's argument. He admits the hypothetical nature of the starting-point or primary origin of the mixed race, but proceeds to the discussion of its development. The Magyar stem, he contends, remained Turkish, while the branches, by the process of engrafting, assumed an Ugric character. This peculiarity should, however, be noticed\u2014that whereas, in other instances, the conquerors identified themselves with the conquered en masse, often losing their own nationality, here the original\nlanguage only (Turkish) was changed under Ugric influence, but the Magyar nation was for centuries preserved in its type and characteristic originality.\n\nAt the next meeting of the Academy, on May 16th, M. Hunfalvy severely criticized M. Vamb\u00e9ry's theory. A summary of the purport of his criticism will be more appropriate in these pages than a repetition of language called forth a special protest.\n\nNot a single authority, it is urged, is quoted for the origin of the Hungarian from non-existing triliteral roots; the course of reasoning explained by which such conclusion is reached. As to the assertion that the seed from which the Magyar nation sprung was Turkish, but that it became Magyar through contact with the Ugers, the proposition is stated at variance with all philological experience. The Magyar tongue, like the properly so-called Ugric dialect, differs from the Finnish and Turkish by peculiar verbal affixes. Moreover, the verb is the bone and marrow of every language, which cannot be exchanged, altered, or transplanted from one into another. If therefore, it is argued, the seed of the development of Magyar national growth were Turkish, then this last could, under no circumstances, undergo a change; that is to say, the Turkish verb could never have received the peculiar verbal inflection mentioned, being the characteristic feature of the Magyar tongue. Lastly, M. Hunfalvy points out the relationship which existed between the Magyars and the Kazars in the eighth and ninth centuries, warranting the hypothesis that the Turkish words found in Magyar are derived from that source: words, for instance, with a double s change the s into r, as \u00f6k\u00fcz T.=\u00f6k\u00f6r Hung.; Tenger; and so on.\nART. XIX.\u2014Ancient Sculptures in China. By Douglas, M.R.A.S., Professor of Chin College, London.\n\nHITHERTO China has yielded few sculptured figures can be regarded as of importance by students of com archaeology. More than usual interest therefore at a set of engravings collected in a Chinese work entit Soh (1806),\u00b9 in which are represented a series of sc which stand on the walls of the sacrificial temple of family in the neighbourhood of the district city of K in the province of Shan-tung. These works of a executed in A.D. 147, at the cost of the two sons Liang, whose sacrificial temple they were intended manently to adorn.

The subjects of which the differ from all other Chinese sculptured designs know of, in that many of the scenes they depict curious similarity to some of those to be met wit mythologies of Egypt, Babylonia and Greece. I have, I believe, been taken of them, but not having opportunity of comparing a copy with the engraving\n\n\u00b9 A copy of this work was, I believe, presented by Dr. Bushell of the Oriental Congress of Berlin, 1881. The British Museum also posse\nShih Soh, I am unable personally to answer for the exact accuracy of the Chinese artist. I have, however, the authority of the Marquis Ts\u00eang, who had visited the Wu temple, for saying that the engravings are truthful reproductions of the originals. In the following notice I propose to refer to some few out of the many scenes depicted, which obviously suggest comparisons with mythological ideas anciently current in countries further westward. The art, it will be at once seen from the accompanying plates, is purely Chinese; but there is much in the attitudes of the figures and of the architectural surroundings to remind us of the sculptured remains of other lands. The sculptures in question are arranged in double tiers round the hall, and though in some instances the scenes immediately above and below each other appear to have some connexion, this is not so in all cases. The series begins with a sculpture (see Plate I.) of three figures, two of which represent a man and a woman with human bodies and heads and with serpents' tails which are intertwined. The male figure holds in his hand a carpenter's square, which he appears to be handing to the female figure, while between these two, hanging in the air by their sleeves, is a boy with two shapeless legs. The Editor's note at the side has reference to the male figure only and reads, \"Fu-hi Ts'ang-ting was the first to practise royal duties. He drew the (eight) diagrams, and knotted cords in order to govern the people within the seas.\" The female figure is recognized as that of N\u00fc-kwa, who by some historians is said to have been Fuh-hi's sister, and is here represented as his wife, and by others to have been separated from him by many generations. Of the boy the Editor can make nothing.\n\nNow we know that according to Chinese legends both Fuh-hi and N\u00fc-kwa had human bodies and dragons' or serpents' tails; that they instructed men in the rudiments of civilization, the use of letters and the arts of common life; that they taught the people to clothe themselves, to cook food, and established marriage.\n\nThe benefits they thus conferred upon mankind forcibly remind us of those attributed to the Fish God of Babylonia,\nwho rose from the sea every morning and who is\nthe people bordering on the Persian Gulf in the\nsciences. But we are further told in the Chinese le\nhistory that N\u00fc-kwa had the head of a cow,\npeculiarity leads us beyond Babylonia to the bank\nNile, where we read of the Goddess Isis, who\nox-headed helmet, and who, curiously enough, in com\nwith the God Osiris and their son Horus, form\nmany of the features of which could not be more ac\nrepresented than by this sculpture in Shantung.\nwell-known triad Osiris and Isis are commonly rep\nas husband and wife, and sometimes as brother an\nand Horus, as a boy.

Monkeys appear to have been trained to assist in gathering the fruit, and the Egyptians represent them in the sculptures handing down figs from the sycamore trees to the gardeners below.\"\u00b9 It is difficult to identify the kind of tree represented in the Chinese sculpture, but in the accompanying illustration (Plate III.) from Wilkinson's Ancient Egyptians, vol. ii. p. 107, which, together with the succeeding plates from the same source, I am, by the kindness of Mr. Murray, allowed here to reproduce, a number of birds are depicted as resting on lotus flowers, identical in shape with those on the Chinese tree, while at the side a man is hurling a 'throw-stick' at them.\n\nIn Plate IV. is shown an object which strikingly resembles an Egyptian obelisk. It will be remembered that obelisks were built to keep off the evil influence of the air, and were, it is believed, dedicated to the sun.\u00b2 In the Chinese sculpture we have, as will be seen, a being with shapeless legs, similar to that shown in Plate I., in opposition to a figure which may possibly be intended to represent a spirit of evil. The Editor of the Shih Soh describes the subject of this Plate as being in appearance a man cutting a tree. But this, in common with all the other notes supplied by the Editor, is merely a guess, hazarded without any special knowledge, and in complete ignorance of every thing beyond the frontiers of China.\n\nThe 5th Plate to which I would draw attention shows the arch of heaven formed by a double-headed dragon. The same idea we find frequently represented in Egyptian mythology. In the accompanying plate (Plate VI.) from Wilkinson's Ancient Egyptians, vol. iii. p. 206, the goddess Pe, whose emblem was the firmament, is depicted bending forward with outspread arms overshadowing the earth and encompassing it in imitation of the vault of heaven, reaching from one side of the horizon to the other.

See Records of the Past, vol. xii. p. 135, line 135.\nANCIENT SCULPTURES IN CHINA.\n\nNaville's Book of the Dead, the vault is formed by whose head a cat, which is seated within the scene cutting off with a knife.\n\nPlate VII. represents a triad consisting of a female with the head of an animal producing a boy from her mouth while opposite to her is a figure with a somewhat human head which, in this case, is surmounted by a serpent. In the right hand this figure holds a weapon, and in the left a sceptre. On the ground by the first figure is a large bird.\n\nIt is impossible not to be reminded by these figures of the goddesses Mut and Bast of Egypt. Mut, as we know, was the mother of all things, and had the power, according to some authorities, of producing men from her mouth and things from her eyes. In the Egyptian sculptures she is represented as wearing on her head a double crown, placed upon a cap ornamented with the head, body, and wings of a vulture, with which bird she is usually associated in the hieroglyphics. In other representations she is given the head of either a lion or a cat, though which it is intended to be is, as Sir G. Wilkinson remarks, frequently difficult to ascertain. Connected with Mut is the goddess Bast, who is graced with a head bearing the same features; on her head she carries a disk and a royal crown, and in her hand she holds the usual sceptre of the Egyptian goddesses. In some of the sculptures the disk on the head is omitted, and the asp alone is represented.\n\nIn Plate VIII. is shown the goddess Nut pouring water from a tree into a bowl held by a bird with a human head. A somewhat analogous scene is depicted in the Assyrian sculptures, in which a man is receiving in a bowl the \"dew of heaven,\" which is pouring from the branches of a tree.\n\nPlate IX. forms a companion picture to a sculpture representing a deity being drawn through the clouds in a chariot by three doves, five horses, and three dragons, following the pattern of dragons found in the Assyrian sculptures. The chariot is covered by a canopy which is surmounted by a\n\n---\n\n1 Wilkinson, vol. iii, pp. 31, 34.\n2 Wilkinson, vol. iii, p. 62.\na dove's head, and the cort\u00e9ge, which is accompanied by winged figures and doves, is met and welcomed by a male figure. In this Plate another chariot, drawn by seven dragons, bears a man in an opposite direction through the clouds into the presence of a winged standard-bearer, who is standing on a dove-headed cloud. It was suggested to me by my friend Prof. Terrien de Lacouperie that these sculptures might possibly bear some relation to the legendary visit of Muh wang (B.C. 1001\u2013946) to Si wang mu, the Royal Mother of the West, and of hers to him. On further investigation I am convinced that this is so, and that while the sculpture referred to represents Si wang mu's cort\u00e9ge, that shown in Plate IX. depicts that of Muh wang. Si wang mu, the Royal Mother of the West, was, according to Chinese legend, \"a fabulous being of the female sex dwelling upon Mount Kwen lun,\" where, by the border of the Lake of Gems grows \"the peach tree of the genii whose fruit confers the gift of immortality... and from whence she despatches the azure-winged birds or doves who serve (like the doves of Venus) as her attendants and messengers.\" Sometimes she is described as having a human head and a bird's body. The description of this goddess bears a curious resemblance to that of Athor, who was known also as \"Het Heru, or Horus's (the Sun's) mundane habitation,\" and as Mut or Mother, and especially as Mother of young Horus. This goddess, to whom the cow was sacred, was thought to live behind the Western Mountain, of Thebes, and it was into her \"arms that the setting sun as it retired behind the mountain was said to be received.\" The persea tree which, as Sir G. Wilkinson says, \"was often confounded by ancient authors\" with the peach, was sacred to her. Like Si wang mu, also, she is said to have been occasionally \"represented as a bird with a human head.\" We find then that these two goddesses both dwelt on or behind the Western Mountains, the home of the sun;\n\n---\n\n1 Mayer's Chinese Reader's Manual, p. 178.\n2 Wilkinson, vol. iii. p. 110.\n3 Wilkinson, vol. iii. p. 115.\n4 Wilkinson, vol. iii. p. 121.\nthat the same superhuman form is by some assigned to both of them; that the peach tree was common to both; that the attribute of mother is given to both; that they both employed doves as their attendants, and as messengers. But to complete the analogy between these two myths of Athor and Si wang mu, we should find a reference to the sun sinking into the arms of the mother-goddess. And this we do in legendary records which have been collected round the career of Muh wang (B.C. 1001-27).\n\nIn the history of this prince, which is said to have been found in a tomb of one of the Wei Princes in 281 B.C., there is an account of a journey made by him to Si wang mu, which so many of the characteristics of the Sun god are introduced that it is impossible not to recognize in him the counterpart of the Greek Phoebus. We are told how he started on his journey amid rain and snow, that he passed over the gold-plated hill he reached the Mountain of the Spring, and eventually arrived at the abode of the Mother of the West. In Plate IX. he is represented as being drawn through the clouds by seven dragon steeds, which bear a resemblance both in number and significance to the celebrated horses of Phoebus, as the following table shows:\n\n| Phoebus's Horses | Muh wang's steeds |\n|------------------|-------------------|\n| \u0392\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7 = Thunder | Yu lun = A wheel passing over |\n| \u1f19\u03c9\u03c2 = Daybreak   | K'uhwang = Wide spreading |\n| \u0391\u1f34\u03b8\u03bf\u03c8 = Flashing | Tao li = Fleet racer |\n| \u0391\u1f34\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd = Fiery    | Ch'ih ki = Red steed |\n| \u1f18\u03c1\u03c5\u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 = Red producer | Hwa liu = Effulgent red |\n| \u03a6\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 = Earth-loving | Shan tze = Son of the Mother |\n| \u03a0\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 = Fiery  | Luh urh = Green-eared |\n\nIt is curious also to observe that a winged bull appears among the animals forming part of the cort\u00e9ge.\n\nIn the text of the work above mentioned an eighth horse is added to the seven, which is called Poh i, which may be translated \"Manifested righteousness.\" The last\nstates that Muh wang had four jewels which appear to correspond to the four planets anciently known to the Chinese, viz. Mars, Venus, Mercury and Saturn; of these Mars was said to be red in colour, Venus golden, Mercury silver, and Saturn yellow. The colours of the first three are fittingly symbolized by the Suen chu, a Redstone, Hwang Kin kaou 'The richness of yellow gold,' and Chuh yin, 'Bright silver.' But the fourth of Muh wang's jewels is Yuh kwo, 'the perfection of gems,' a name which curiously resembles the title of \"beautiful,\" given to Saturn both by the Egyptians and the Greeks.\n\nMuh wang, we are further told, was, like Apollo, armed with a bow which shot forth darts at men, and was followed by dogs which, as though he were the protector of flocks and herds like the Greek God, were the enemies of beasts of prey.\n\nOn the last day of the Sexagenary cycle Muh wang reached the abode of Si wang mu, who entertained him on the shores of the lake of gems with such delights that he forgot to return homewards until reminded of his duties by the goddess, who sang him the following song:\n\nWhite clouds float across the sky,\nThe mountain peaks appear on high;\nLong and distant is your way,\nWhere the streams through mountains stray:\nImmortal may you ever be,\nAnd oft return to visit me!\n\nAccepting the hint, Muh wang sang in response:\n\nAgain to Eastern land I wend my way,\nTo bend the summer to my general sway;\nWhen men have peaceful and contented grown,\nAgain I'll turn me to your royal throne:\nWhen thrice the year has run its race amain,\nAcross the wilds I'll hither come again.\n\nHe then ascended his chariot and departed.\nPLAN OF MOSQUE\nOF SULTAN MASIR, NASIR ED DIN. MOHAMED EBN KALAOUN.\nCAIRO CITADEL.\n\nWalling shown in black; the rest is modern rubble masonry.\nXX.\u2014The Mosque of Sultan Nasir Mohammed Kalaoun, in the Citadel of Cairo. By Major C. Watson, R.E.\n\n(Communicated by H. C. Kay, Esq., M.R.A.S.)\n\nThe mosque of Sultan Nasir ebn Kalaoun, which stands at the centre of Cairo citadel, although one of the most interesting in the city, seems to have received less attention than it deserves. This is probably due to the fact that, many years past, it has ceased to be used as a mosque, and been thrown into the background by the great Mosque of Mohamed Ali Pasha, which is visited by at least a thousand persons for every one who takes the trouble to enter the royal mosque of the citadel.\n\nIt was used for a considerable time as a prison, and during recent years has been a military store-house, where heaps of all kinds of articles were piled up in confusion. High walls of rough rubble masonry had been built between the pillars, in order to divide the space into compartments suitable for prison or store purposes.\n\nIn consequence of the position I recently held in Egyptian War Office, I was able to have the whole of stores, with which the mosque was encumbered, removed to other places, and to take down a number of the partition walls which closed the intervals between the pillars. William Freeman, of the Royal Sussex Regiment, gave material assistance by allowing the military prisoners, whom he was in charge, to work upon the removal of walls. Sufficient of these have now been pulled down to show the beautiful interior of the mosque to full advantage. Certain of the walls I was afraid to remove, because, before they could be done with safety, it would be necessary to take measures for the security of the pillars and arches,\nof which are in a dangerous condition. I applied to the Egyptian Committee for the Preservation of Arab Monuments for a grant of funds for this purpose; but they, while fully acknowledging the importance of the work, were obliged to refuse, in consequence of the small amount available for the restoration of ancient buildings.\n\nIt will be seen from the plan of the mosque attached to this paper, that the east and south arcades are now almost completely cleared. In the north and west arcades the partition walls still remain.\n\nI have annexed a set of photographs of this most interesting monument, which give a better idea of its present condition than any written description can do. These photographs, with the exception of two, which were taken by M. Facchinelli, were taken by M. Sebah, of Cairo, at the request of the Committee alluded to above.\n\nThe Mosque was built in the year 1318 A.D. by Sultan Nasir Mohammed, the son of Sultan el Mansoor Kalaoun. Sultan Nasir had an eventful reign, having come to the throne at a very early age, and having been twice dethroned and twice restored. It was during the period after his second restoration that he built the citadel mosque.\n\nFor some reason that is not quite clear, it is sometimes erroneously called the Mosque of Salah ed Din, and almost every Dragoman who professes to exhibit the sights of Cairo to travellers, calls it by this name. Perhaps Salah ed Din may have built a mosque on the same site which was afterwards replaced by that of Nasir.\n\nMakrizi's notes upon the mosque run as follows:\n\n\"This mosque, situated in the citadel of the mountain, was erected by the order of King Nasir Mohamed ibn Kalaoun in the year 718 of the Hegira. He caused a magnificent dome to be placed upon the summit of it. An iron maksourah\\(^1\\) was also constructed; and, at the entrance of the mosque, was a maksourah of iron, in which the Sultan performed the duties of prayer. The mosque was endowed with funds which largely exceeded the\n\n\\(^1\\) A kind of screen.\nexpenses, and it became one of the richest and most magnificent mosques in Egypt.\"\n\nThe mosque stands in the central court of the citadel. In plan it is approximately square, measuring 206 feet north to south and 186 feet from east to west. In spite of the direction of the sides of the mosque, it is convenient to consider that the east wall runs north and south, although, of course, as in all Cairo mosques, it really runs more towards north-west and south-west.\n\nThe principal entrance to the mosque was in the centre of the west wall, but this doorway is now built up. Instead of the door is a minaret of a description by no means common, the stones being carved in a very bold zigzag pattern. The summit is covered with green enamelled tiles, beneath which an Arabic inscription encircles the minaret.\n\nThe door is in a deep recess, and over it is a tablet which is the following inscription:\n\n\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u064a\u0645 \u0623\u0645\u0631\u0627\u064b \u0623\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639\n\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u064a\u062f \u0644\u0648\u062c\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0633\u064a\u062f\u0646\u0627 \u0648\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646\n\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0646\u064a\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646\n\u062f \u0642\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0633\u0646\u0629 \u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0639\u0634\u0631\u0629 \u0648\u0633\u0628\u0639 \u0645\u0627\u064a\u0647 \u0645\u0646\n\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0628\u0648\u064a\u0629\n\n\"In the name of God the Merciful, the Gracious. He ordered the building of this mosque, the Blessed, the Happiest of the sake of God, whose name be exalted, is our Lord and Master, the Sultan and King, the conqueror of the world and faith, Mohamed, son of our Lord the Sultan Kalaoun Es Salch, in seventh months and year of the Hegira of the Prophet seven hundred eighteen.\"\n\nThis corresponds with the year 1318 A.D.\n\nIn an upper part of the west wall is a row of clerestory windows which goes all round the mosque. These windows were formerly filled with beautiful tracery and stained glass, but only a few fragments now remain.\nThe door which is now used is in the north side of the mosque. Over it is an Arabic inscription, of which the lower half is broken away, but the two lines which remain intact are identical with the two upper lines of the inscription over the west door. At the north-east angle is the second minaret of the mosque. It is of a different pattern to the west minaret, but, like it, the summit is capped with green enamelled tiles.\n\nThe exterior of the east wall of the mosque is much concealed by rubbish, and by some mean buildings which have been erected against it, and the south side is in a similar condition. In the latter wall is a doorway into the mosque, which was probably the Sultan's private entrance. This door is now blocked up with masonry. Close to it are some ancient masonry vaults of great strength, which are well worth investigation. They may have formed part of the outer wall of the original fortress, but it is not at present easy to follow their plan.\n\nAs I have already stated, the only entrance to the mosque now available is that in the north wall. From this a passage leads into the centre court.\n\nThe plan of the mosque is a simple one. An arcade runs round the whole of the interior, having four rows of columns on the east and two upon each of the other sides. The width of the eastern arcade is 64 feet, that of the northern and southern 37 feet, and that of the western 29 feet 6 inches. In the centre of the eastern arcade and over the kibleh, the pillars are replaced by ten monolithic granite columns of very large size. These columns supported the magnificent dome described by Makrizi, which unfortunately has fallen in. The Kibleh, also, which, according to tradition, was specially magnificent, has been removed, and the space which it occupied has been filled in with rubble masonry. The columns of the dome have no bases, and the capitals are very plain. There is no doubt that they, as well as the other pillars of the mosque, were carried off from Memphis, or some other ancient city. Photograph No. 6 gives a good representation of some of the great columns.\nThe dome columns are surmounted by arches of alternate red and white stones, and above these is an inscription upon a broad wooden band, which runs round the side, and runs as follows:\n\n**South Wall.**\n\n \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u064a\u0645 \u064a\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0646 \u0623\u0633\u0631\u0648\u0627 \u0623\u0631\u0643\u0645\u0648 \u0623\u0648 \u0627\u0633\u062c\u062f\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0648 \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0648\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u0646\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u064a\u0631 \u0644\u0643\u0645 \u062a\u0642\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0646\n\n**East Wall.**\n\n \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u064a\u0645 \u0627\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0639\u0645\u0631\u0648 \u0633\u0627\u062c\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0631\u0642\u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0623\u064a\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0643\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062e\u0634\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\n\n**North Wall.**\n\n \u0644\u0646\u0643\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u062a\u062f\u064a\u0646 ... \u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0646\u0634\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u062e\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0648\n\n**West Wall.**\n\n \u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u062d\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0635\u0648\u0631 \u0633\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0646\u064a\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0641\u0644\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0631\u062d\u0645\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0633\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0633\u0628\u0639\u0647 ...........\n\n\"In the name of the Most Merciful God.

By Professor Georg von der Gabelentz, of the University of Leipzig.\n\nPrepared at the request of, and communicated by, Dr. R. N. Cusy, Honorary Secretary, with a Note.\n\n[The writer of this communication is the son of H. C. Von der Gabelentz; and is, like his distinguished father was before him, one of the most remarkable Linguistic Scholars of his time. He treats of a subject which is of the greatest importance, and which has this year been brought prominently to the notice of scholars by the Comparative Grammar of the Melanesian Languages compiled by the Rev. R. H. Codrington of the Melanesian Mission, and published by the Clarendon Press. The Archipelago of Islands, known by the name of Melanesia, from the dark colour of their Negrito inhabitants, as distinguished from the fair Polynesians further to the East, extends in a chain of Islands from the Southern Point of New Guinea to Fiji, and includes in addition to those Islands the Groups known as Solomon, Santa Cruz, Banks, Torres Islands, New Hebrides, Loyalty and New Caledonia. They have been the scene of outrages on the part of the white traders, and vengeful murders on the part of the natives: they are a bone of contention betwixt England and France: their population is wasting away by kidnapping to supply the wants of Planters in Queensland and the Fiji Islands, and by infectious diseases, and spirituous liquors introduced by Europeans. The Bible has been translated into several of the languages (and each of the larger Islands has its own language or even several distinct languages), but it is calculated that in a few years the population will, like that of Tasmania, have totally disappeared, and the languages remain as literary survivals.]\nTHE LANGUAGES OF MELANESIA.\n\nIn this valuable book\u00b9 the work begun and enlarged by my dear father,\u00b2 and continued by Dr. A. B. Meyer and myself, is taken up on a new plan and on a somewhat broader scale. My father's work comprised twenty-three languages, while in the book before us the number of languages treated in separate grammars and grammatical notes amounts to thirty-five, eleven of which are identical with those contained in my father's book. Besides these grammatical notes are inserted on four other languages belonging to the family. Leaving these aside, forty-seven Melanesian languages may henceforth be counted as more or less similar in regard to their grammatical structure. Lifu has been analyzed in my father's two volumes, has since been the object of Notes grammaticales sur le langue de Lifu par A. C., Paris, 1882, 8vo. On Aneityum we have a Dictionary of the Aneityumese Language, etc., also a Grammar of Aneityumese Grammar, by J. Inglis, London, 1876, 12mo. On Mota, the author's own Grammatical Notes, London, 1877, 8vo. While Professor H. Kern of Leipzig recently made Fijian the subject of copious and comparative researches (De Fidjitaal vergeleken met Verwanten in Indonesi\u00eb en Polynesi\u00eb, Amsterdam, 4to.). These works and a Dictionary by the Rev. Mr. Brown, Wesleyan Missionary, of the Duke of York's Island Language, New Britain Group, also a Grammar of the same, printed in thirty copies by hectography, London, 1882, 4to., are the principal exponents of Melanesian linguistic literature that have come to my notice. The amount is little, indeed, considering the width and weight of the subject, and sincere thanks are due to the learned authors for the extensive and painful researches the results of which are now at his fellow-labourers' disposal. The following abstract will furnish an idea of the plan followed.\n\n\u00b9 The Melanesian Languages. By R. H. Codrington. 8vo. pp. 350-355.\n\u00b2 H. C. von der Gabelentz, Die melanesischen Sprachen nach ihrem grammatischen Bau und ihrer Verwandtschaft, etc. 2 voll. Abhandl. d. K. Ges. d. Wissensch. Leipzig, 1861, 1873.\n\u00b3 Vol. xix. of the same Abhandlungen.\n\nVOL. XVIII.\u2014[NEW SERIES.]\nAn introduction, pp. 1-31, describes the geographical extension of Melanesian nations and languages; a general map of Melanesia is added, and further on, there are special maps of the single groups. Then the author points out the kinship of the Melanesian languages as well between themselves as with the Malayo-Polynesian family, finally leading up to a new theory on the origin and prospects of these languages, to which I shall refer towards the end of this paper.\n\nThe second section is devoted to comparative lexicology. The nine words in fifty-nine languages collected by Mr. Wallace, and seventy words in forty languages synoptically arranged by the author, are discussed and compared between themselves and with corresponding words in Malay, Malag\u00e1si, Maori, and, here and there, other languages akin, such as Batta, Samoa, etc. On p. 60, No. 10, it might be observed that in Maf\u00far K\u00f6r (not Kur) 'bone,' corresponds to Malay tulang.\n\nA short comparative grammar of Melanesian languages in connection with Malay, Malag\u00e1si and Maori, follows, pp. 101-192. Here the principal common facts and forms of the Melanesian branch are set forth and discussed. Without entering into details, I shall content myself with stating that, in the majority of the cases where my views differ from the author's, this is owing to his general hypothesis already alluded to.\n\nPhonology, pp. 193-219, and numeration, pp. 220-251, are treated in separate sections. In the former, little attempt has been made either to group the languages in respect to phonetic laws, or to gain something like the laws, which form the pride of Indo-Germanic science: laws, I mean to say, which declare peremptorily that this sound in one language must correspond, under the same circumstances, to that in a certain other language. Observations of this nature, indeed, are to be met with interspersed in the grammatical monographs. But even if this were not the case, the defect would be of less importance than might seem. Apparently in those insular languages articulation has been of old, and is partly now, less distinct,\nTHE LANGUAGES OF MELANESIA.\n\nless firm and fixed, than it is in our Arian family. Wise speaking, had the ancestors of those islanders an alphabet of their own, containing, as is the case Devanagari, just as many symbols as there were really distinguished in the language, this alphabet have been far poorer in symbols, and its symbols pa strict in phonetic value, their pronunciation allowin variety, than would Devanagari. So, indeed, the acknowledged only three vowels and thirteen con This fact of lax articulation explains the irregularity parentely capricious, occurring to any one who under lexical comparison of the Malay languages, nor has eliminated even by such careful and judicious resea are contained in Brandes' Bijdragen tot de verge Klankleer, etc.\n\nThe last part of the book, pp. 253-572, contains g and grammatical sketches of thirty-five Melanesian guages, geographically arranged. Of these, Mo occupies pages 253 to 310, so that the average ap to each of the other thirty-four does not exceed seven and a half. Scanty as this may seem, the gram materials brought to the reader's notice are somewi than would have been possible had the author fo different plan. The arrangement of the monogr the whole, is worthy of approval and agreeing to nature of the languages in question. Syntax has been made the object of separate chapters. Exam consisting of complete sentences are to be found in number only in a part of the sketches, and so are sho Reasons independent of his intentions may have p the learned author from being so munificent in this we should have desired. As it is, let us hope tha find enough encouragement in his praiseworthy ef to publish some day a second volume containing mor glossarice and as many analysed or translated texts as\n\nIt would go far even to enumerate the languages less made known by the work before us. The Ba Torres Islands, not yet accessible to my father's r\nare now represented, the former by twelve, the latter by two: so is the Santa Cruz Group, while other groups have been filled up by new members. Of the languages treated by my father, Fiji, Aneityum, Erromanga, Tanna, Mallikolo, Lifu, Uea, Gera of Guadalcanar, Eddystone, Bauro, Mara, Ma-siki, and the three New Caledonian, have been left aside, while for the eleven others the author had such materials at hand as made him wish to see them produced anew.\n\nLet us now, in the author's own words, explain the theory developed in his introductory chapter. \"Suppose,\" he says, \"in the islands adjacent to the Asiatic continent a population of dark-coloured and curly-haired physical character with their own language. Suppose the islands to be settled with this population, originally of one stock, and the gradual settlements of the islands further away to the south-east to be going on by the people of the one stock, their language diverging as time and distance increase. Suppose Asiatic people, lighter in complexion and straight-haired, to have intercourse with the island people nearest to the continent, going over to trade with them, residing on the island coasts, giving rise to a certain number of half-castes. These half-castes, then, in regard to language, would be island-people. They would not follow their foreign fathers' speech, but their mothers' and their fellow-villagers'; but in regard to physical appearance they would be mixed, lighter than their mothers in complexion, with flatter features (if their mothers were Papuans and their fathers like Chinese), and their hair would be straighter. This mixed breed would begin on the coast and increase; it would mix in its turn both with the inland people and with the foreign visitors\u2014relatives on the fathers' side. The result, after a time, would be that in the interior of the island the aboriginal inhabitants would remain physically and in speech what they were, but on the coast and towards the coast there would be a great mixture of various degrees of crossings, some very like the Asiatic visitors, some very little unlike the inland people, but all speaking the island-language,\" etc.\n\nLinguistic reasons, I think, would rather recommend a\nTHE LANGUAGES OF MELANESIA.\n\ncontrary supposition. Let us break before all hypothetic dualism of ascending and descending ment, and with the superstition that the former general state of agglutinative languages. As to the family, traces more or less rudimentary of that won rich and symmetrical grammatical system by which Philippine languages and their nearer relatives except be found throughout, and more recently such traces have pointed out in Fiji and the Polynesian Family by Prof. The like are met with, more or less fragmentary, this the Melanesian Group. Had we not better, under circumstances, speak of decay on the latter side, and higher primitiveness to those languages which have developed forms where others show lumps and stumps to the speciality insisted upon by the author on pp. the fact that a part of the substantives requires possessive affixes, while the other part does not, is by confined to the Malayo-Polynesian family, but based on reasons, and therefore common to very different la Relations, familiar or social, members of the body parts of things, require logically something or they belong to\u2014a genitive case. A father, an eye, part, are somebody's father, somebody's eye, son upper part. From this it seems to follow that tinction made by the Melanesians may hardly be as a striking proof of greater originality. While Polynesian Languages such possessive affixes are wanting, they are in full vigour in the higher of the Malayan, and there applicable not only substantive noun without exception, but also, as auctoris, to the (in reality nominal) passive forms verbe. Here again the superiority in point of development and the presumption of better conserva think, on the Malayan side.\n\nThere is one fact, however, which impartiality me to pass by in silence. The Negrito languages Philippines appear, judging from the scanty spec my possession, to enjoy grammatical systems very\nin fullness, richness, and in the phonetic means employed, to those of their light-coloured neighbours. Should, then, these be the keepers of the family treasure, the heirs of our author's ancient island-language? I doubt whether any one, though prepossessed in favour of Mr. Codrington's theory, would insist upon such a possibility any longer than the time needed for a superficial examination and comparison of the materials. Everybody would gain the conviction that, in this instance at least, the light-coloured men were the givers and the black men the receivers, for while Tag\u00e1la and its sisters form integrating members in the close and solid chain of their Malayan kinship, the idioms of the Zambales, Mariveles, etc., stand in evident opposition to those of the other black islanders, with which, of course, they are related, but only loosely and by Malayan intermediation. Moreover, which is more probable \\textit{a priori}, that the more highly endowed Malays should have adopted the languages of inferior aborigines, or the contrary? Which, I ask, is more analogous to experience? It is much to be desired that Professor Kern, or a scholar equally well versed in comparative Malayo-Polynesian studies, would submit the Melanesian materials, grammatical and lexicological, to investigations similar to those exhibited in the former's \"Fidjitaal.\" Then we might expect to see the observations made above confirmed in more than one point, and many of the words till now looked upon as originally Melanesian, derived from Malayan sources.\n\nBut strong and eager as may seem my criticism of the author's theory, stronger yet is my feeling of gratitude and indebtedness for the eminent merits of his laborious work.\nThe following particulars on the origin and early history of the Banu 'Okayl are from Ibn Khald\u016bn, vol. ii. vol. vi. p. 11, etc. (Bulak Edition).\n\nI may perhaps allow myself to begin by reminding the reader that Eastern writers invariably represent the Isma'ili Arabs as the posterity of 'Adnan, descendant of Ishmael, the people of each tribe as the actual children of one or other of the Arab Patriarch's posterity, after each of whom the tribe is usually named. But it is obviously unnecessary, say the least of it, to regard the genealogies attributed to tribes as anything more than the real or reputed pedigrees of their chiefs. Indeed it is difficult to suppose that historians themselves can seriously contend for much. All the Isma'ili Arabs, they tell us, are the descendants of 'Adnan, and indeed of his son Ma'add. The latter was about twelve years of age, and when the invasion of Aram by Bukht Nasar (Nebuchadnezzar) was about to take place, he was conveyed to Harr\u0101n in Mesopotamia. 'Adnan died shortly after. Ma'add on his return to Arabia, after the death of Bukht Nasar, found that his father's people had joined the Yamanites. He collected them together and brought them back to the territory of Mecca, and although they are styled his brethren and kindred, we cannot...\nit to be seriously urged that they were his brothers, the sons of his father.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe tribe of \u2018O\u1e33ayl, descended from Mo\u1e0dar, through \u1e32ays \u2018Aylan and Haw\u0101zin, was one of five subdivisions of the Banu Ka\u2018b. They were the Banu \u2018O\u1e33ayl, Har\u012bsh, \u1e32ushayr, Ja\u2019dah, and \u2018Ijl\u0101n ibn \u2018Abdall\u0101h ibn Ka\u2018b. The second, third and fourth of these are said to have become extinct in the early days of Isl\u0101m. The Banu Ka\u2018b are themselves described as sons of Rabi\u2018ah, son of \u2018\u0100mir, son of Sa\u2018sa\u2018ah, and the Banu Rabi\u2018ah were one of four sister-tribes, of which the other three were the Banu Numayr, Suwat and Hilal.\n\nThe homes of the Banu \u2018\u0100mir ibn Sa\u2018sa\u2018ah were at an early date the deserts of Nejd adjoining to Tih\u0101mah, extending thence to the confines of Syria and on the south to the neighbourhood of Ta-if. At a later period they spread into the Syrian deserts, thence to \u2018Ir\u0101k, and the greater portion of the tribe became ere long scattered throughout the countries of Isl\u0101m. Ibn Khald\u016bn states on the authority of Ibn Hazm that the great sept of the Banu \u2018\u0100mir ibn Sa\u2018sa\u2018ah alone equalled in numbers all the other Modarite tribes.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe Banu \u2018O\u1e33ayl were divided into many subtribes. Of these were the Banu Muntafi\u1e33, son of \u2018\u0100mir, son of \u2018O\u1e33ayl, from whom, according to Ibn \u2018Abd al Az\u012bz al Jurj\u0101n\u012b, as quoted by Ibn Khald\u016bn, were derived those Arabs, known in North Africa under the name of Khulu\u1e6d, who in the days of the historian inhabited the country between Marocco and Fez.\\(^3\\) They lived, together with certain subtribes of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Ibn Khald\u016bn, vol. ii. pp. 241, 298.\n\n\\(^2\\) In translating that passage, in his *Histoire des Berb\u00e8res*, de Slane applies it to the \u2018O\u1e33aylis alone. And that no doubt is the natural construction to be placed upon the words as they stand in the original. But I think the meaning intended by the author is as I have stated it in the text, a reading, I may add, which makes the statement somewhat less startling and incredible.\n\nIbn Hazm was the author of a book, *Kit\u0101b Jamharat al Ans\u0101b*, mentioned in the *Kashf ez Zun\u016bn*, and frequently quoted in Ibn Khald\u016bn\u2019s work on the Arab tribes. He was a native of Cordova, and died in A.H. 366. His life is given by Ibn Khallikan (de Slane\u2019s translation, vol. ii. p. 267), and a short notice of him and of his chief writings in Al Makkari\u2019s work on the Arabs of Spain, vol. ii. p. 963 (Bul. ed.), but neither of these writers makes mention of the *Kit\u0101b al Jamharat*.\n\n\\(^3\\) The life of Al Jurj\u0101n\u012b, who died in A.H. 366, is given by Ibn Khallikan, vol. ii. p. 221. I read the word Khulu\u1e6d as the plural of Khal\u016b\u1e6d. See Lane\u2019s Dictionary.\nthe Banu Hilal, in close alliance with the Banu J\u0101li tribe descended, like the Banu \u2018Okayl, from the Haw\u0101zin, and the designation of Jushamites was bestowed upon all.\n\nThe Khulu\u1e6d entered Africa along with the Banu Sulaym tribe which was, as already stated, a branch of the Banu Sa\u2018a\u2018ah. A portion of the Banu Hil\u0101l had settled in North Africa in the days of the Fatimite Khal\u012bfah al-Mustan\u1e63ir but the bulk of the tribe, which, together with the Banu Sulaym, had allied itself with the Carmathians of \u1e24aw\u0101zin, was, after the final defeat of the latter by Al-\u2018Az\u012bz, expelled from the eastern banks of the Nile. There they remained under the days of Al Mustan\u1e63ir, who, by the advice of his vizier Yaz\u016br\u012b, and with the object of crushing the rebels, sent the Mu\u2018izz ibn Badis, poured into North Africa in (A.D. 1050\u20131) a horde of Arabs, whose progress is likened by the historian to that of a flight of locusts, devoured the substance of every district through which they passed, spreading ruin and desolation wherever they penetrated.\n\nThey consisted chiefly of the Banu Hil\u0101l, accompanied by their numerous subtribes, and of the Banu Sulaym mentioned, a great and powerful tribe, sister to the Banu Haw\u0101zin, from whom both Banu Hil\u0101l and \u2018Okayl derive their descent.\n\nIt was nearly fifty years previous to these events that an insurrection occurred of the Sharif al Walid ibn Hish\u0101m better known under his nickname of Abu Rakwa claimed descent from the Ommayads, and whose adherents were the Banu Kurrab, a subtribe of the Banu Hil\u0101l. Abu Rakwa was captured and put to death by al-H\u0101kim in A.H. 396.\n\nIn touching upon these events, Ibn Khald\u016bn relates the relations of the Sharif Ibn Hish\u0101m with the Hil\u0101l emigration into Africa, the marriage of the Sharif J\u0101liyah, the sister of the Amir \u1e24asan ibn Sarh\u0101n, and the Banu Athbaj (one of the subtribes of the Banu Hil\u0101l) were made the foundation of many romantic tales, still known in the writer\u2019s time.\nSheikh Hasan al \u2018Att\u0101r, a Cairo \u2018\u0100lim of considerable reputation for learning and scholarship, who died about half a century ago, has added to one of the MSS. of Ibn Khald\u016bn\u2019s work a marginal note, which is preserved in the printed edition (vol. vi. p. 18), and in which he identifies these tales with those that form the leading subject of the collection of legends known as the Story of Abu Zeyd, to this day one of the most popular of the romances with which the public story-tellers are in the habit of entertaining their hearers in the streets of Cairo.\n\nThe justice of Sheikh al \u2018Att\u0101r\u2019s observation is obvious to any person at all acquainted with these tales. Most of them have of late years been printed at Cairo, and that relating to the emigration of the Banu Hil\u0101l from Nejd into Africa, under the guidance of Abu Zeyd, corresponds in almost every detail with the summary furnished by Ibn Khald\u016bn.\u00b9\n\nThe late Mr. Lane, in his Modern Egyptians, supplies a summary of the story of the birth of Abu Zeyd, and a specimen of the verses with which the romances are abundantly interspersed. In their disregard of metrical regularity, the neglect of terminal inflections, as well as in other characteristics, the verses are in complete accord with Ibn Khald\u016bn\u2019s critical observations upon them. To his remark that the tales had, in the course of a long period of time, been subjected to numerous alterations and interpolations, it may be added that there has no doubt been a further accession of alterations of a similar kind during the five centuries that have elapsed since he wrote, but it may be regarded as no less certain that the tales, with their curious idealized pictures of Bedouin life, are still at the present day in every essential particular, identical with those handed down from a remote period to the days of Ibn Khald\u016bn, and the latter remarks that any expression of doubt upon their authenticity was apt to be warmly resented by the Banu Hil\u0101l.\n\nThe Banu Muntaf\u012bk, sons of \u2018Okayl, originally occupied the district of Arabia situated between Teyma and Nejd.\n\n\u00b9 Vol. vi. p. 18. See De Slane\u2019s translation in his Histoire des Berb\u00e8res, vol. i. p. 41.\nHISTORY OF THE BANU 'OKAYL.\n\nThence they removed to the marshy country in the bourhood of Basrah, known as Al Bat\u0101'ih, where they governed by a family of the name of Ma't\u016bf. Their hours were here the Banu '\u0100mir ibn 'Auf, a sister of the Muntafik, descended like itself from the Banu sons of 'Okayl.\n\nA third subtribe, also derived from these Banu were the Banu Khafajah, who took up their abode deserts of \u1e6cr\u0101k. Ibn Khald\u016bn remarks of them that they were noted for their incorrigible turbulence and violence, a statement fully borne out by what we know of their history. In A.H. 452, Toghrul Beg, with the object of obtaining security for their more orderly conduct, appointed their chief to the government of the city of Buweyhi princes. As had happened before, the attempt of the Khafajis over a civilized community could not succeed. We find them, in A.H. 485, attacking and looting the caravans of pilgrims near Kufah, after which, making their way into the city, they plundered and massacred the inhabitants. A few years later a sanguinary war took place between them and their kindred tribe the 'Obadahs, the consequence of which quarrel, which it must be said was carefully promoted by Seyf ed Daulah Sadakah, the wealthy and powerful chief and prince of Hillah, who openly encouraged one party and secretly aided the other. In a severe fight with the 'Obadahs sent against them from Baghdad in A.H. 556, before they had retreated into the Syrian desert, their prowess was distinguished themselves by appearing on the field of battle with water for the relief of their countrymen, but also with knives, with which they mercilessly slaughtered their wounded enemies. On more than one occasion they were nearly exterminated. But the tribe was always remarkable for its vitality as for its turbulence, and continued to inhabit the district bordering upon the Euphrates below Kufah. The Moorish traveller Ibn passed through their country in A.H. 727 (A.D. 1328), speaks of them as brave and powerful, but also as incendiary.\nrobbers, infesting the roads leading to Kufah, and causing ruin both to the city and to its neighbourhood.\n\nI shall have occasion more than once in the course of this paper to speak of the Banu Asad, and of their chiefs of the family of Mazyad, the founders, towards the end of the fourth century of the Hijrah, of a powerful principality on the banks of the Euphrates. The Banu Asad were a Modarite tribe, descended from Khuzaymeh, son of Modrikah, son of Ilyas, the latter brother of \u1e32ays \u2018Ayl\u0101n, ancestor of the \u2018O\u1e33aylis and of the numerous other \u201c\u1e32aisy\u201d tribes.\n\nThe Mazyadis, Princes of Hillah, were members of a sub-tribe of the Asadis, known as the Banu N\u0101shirah. The power of the Asadis in Irak was utterly destroyed by the Khalifah Al Mustanjid Billah in A.H. 558, in revenge for the support they had given to the Seljuk Sultan Muhammad, son of Mahm\u016bd. They were attacked with the assistance of Ibn Ma\u2019r\u016bf, chief of the Banu Muntafik, and 4000 of their warriors were slaughtered. A proclamation of outlawry was issued against them. The tribe utterly disappeared from \u2018Ir\u0101k, and the territories they held in the neighbourhood of the Banu Muntafik were seized by the latter.\n\nThe most celebrated of the Mazyadi princes was Seyf ed Daulah \u1e62adakah, who succeeded to the principality in A.H. 479, and was killed in A.H. 501, in a memorable battle, in which the Asadis and their allies suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Sultan Muhammad, son of Malik Shah. \u1e62adakah was the founder of the city of Hillah\u2014Hillat-es-Seyfiyah, or Hillat-al-Mazyadiyah, which became the capital of the Mazyadis, and replaced the older town of al Jami\u2018\u0101ni (the two Mosques), on the site of the ancient Babylon.\n\nI have alluded to the treacherous conduct of \u1e62adakah towards the Banu \u2018Ob\u0101dah, a circumstance which nevertheless in no way interfered with his being regarded as one of the most celebrated heroes in Arab story, a theme for the praise both of historians and of poets, and among others of Al \u1e24ar\u012br\u012b in his Mak\u0101mat. It must I think in truth be confessed that the claim for magnanimity of character, so freely urged by Arabs on their own behalf, and so generally accorded to them by other races, cannot\nbe said to be confirmed by the study of their history. Khafajis, on at least one occasion, brought upon them severe punishment by an act of treachery committed in defiance of every rule of honest dealing, if not of honesty itself. At the battle of Dhu K\u0101r, almost at the dawn of authentic Arab history, the Banu Iyad, one of the allies of the Persians, sent the enemy on the evening of the first Persian defeat, a promise to desert their allies and inquire whether they should do so that evening or during the course of the battle which was to be renewed the following day.\u00b9 When the Carmathians invaded Egypt, Arab allies, as soon as the fortune of war turned against them, set about attacking and plundering the Carmathian camp; and on the occasion of the second invasion, H\u0101tim al Jarr\u0101h the T\u0101-yite, \u201cAmir of the Arabs of Syria,\u201d accepted a bribe of 100,000 dinars from the enemy, and deserted his friends on the field of battle. His was the tribe to whom famous H\u0101tim the T\u0101-yite, the paragon and example of generosity, belonged. The record of Ibn al Jarr\u0101h and his grandson Al Mufarraj ibn Daghfal is probably strictly historical. When Alftakin fled from the field where he suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the Fatimids, he sought refuge, perishing from thirst, with his friend\u201d Ibn Daghfal. The latter received him in his house and forthwith hurried off to the Fatimite Al \u2018Az\u012bz, to whom he sold his guest for a large sum in gold. These and similar stories, it may be remarked, are given as dry facts of fact, and as a general rule without a word of comment.\n\nReturning now to the Banu \u2018Okayl, another of the tribes remains to be noticed, namely, the Banu \u2018C already hereinbefore alluded to. To that subtribe belongs Leyla al Akhyaliyah, so named after her ancestor son of Ar Rah\u0101l, son of Mu\u2018awiyah, son of \u2018Ob\u0101dah, named Al Akhyal, the freckled. Leyla lived in the time of the Umayyad Khalifah \u2018Abd al Malik, and attained considerable celebrity as a poet. Having towards the end of her life fallen into a state of poverty, she sought and obtained a\n\n\u00b9 Ibn al Athir, vol. i. p. 358.\nin the house of Al Hajj\u0101j, one of whose wives on her arrival loaded her with jewels. \u1e32ays ibn Mall\u016bh, surnamed Al Majn\u016bn, the distracted, is said to have belonged to the same branch of the \u2018Okaylis. The loves of Majn\u016bn and Leyla\u2014who must not be confounded with the poetess just mentioned\u2014form a subject widely celebrated throughout Eastern literature. Leyla is said to have belonged to the sister-tribe of Al Harish, son of Ka\u2018b.\n\nIbn Khald\u016bn says that in his days the Banu \u2018Ob\u0101dah inhabited, along with the Banu Muntafik, the country between Kufah, Wasit and Ba\u1e63rah, and he states, on the authority of Ibn Sa\u2018id, that the \u2018Okayli Princes of Ma\u1e63il and Mesopotamia, whose dynasty endured from about A.H. 380 to the latter end of the following century, belonged to that division of the tribe. According to that same writer a remnant of them still occupied, in the thirteenth century, the district between the river Kh\u0101z\u012br and the Z\u0101b. They were few in numbers, only about one hundred horsemen, but he says they were much respected, and they were in receipt of allowances granted by the Governor of Ma\u1e63il. They were known under the designation of \u201cArabs of Sharaf ed Daulah.\u201d The \u2018Okayli Prince Sharaf ed Daulah Muslim, son of Kureysh, was killed in action with Sultan Suleyman, son of \u1e32utlumish, near Antioch, in A.H. 478. His dominions included the greater part of Mesopotamia and extended from As-Sindiyyah, in the neighbourhood of Baghdad, to Ma\u1e63il, and thence to Aleppo in Syria. With his death the more brilliant period of the \u2018Okayli principality came to an end, and its decline, of which the commencement may indeed be traced under his reign, now made rapid progress. Sharaf ed Daulah had married the aunt of Malik Shah, Safiyah, and had by her a son named Ali. On the death of Malik Shah in 485, the Princess became the wife of Sharaf ed Daulah\u2019s brother Ibrahim, who was defeated and killed in the following year.\n\n1 Abu\u2019l Hasan \u2018Aly ibn Sa\u2018id, the traveller and historian, is much quoted by Ibn Khald\u016bn. He was born at Granada in A.H. 610, and died at Tunis about 685 (A.D. 1286). He was a voluminous writer, and his works were held in high estimation, but, excepting in the form of quotations and extracts, to be found chiefly in Al Makkari, Al Makrizi, and Ibn Khald\u016bn, none of his writings are known to be extant, other than a geographical treatise and a collection of lyrics compiled from the writings of the principal Arab poets down to his time.\n\n2 Ibn al Athir, vol. x. p. 90.\nnear Mausil by Tutush, the brother of Malik Shah. He appointed Ali Governor of Mausil, but was himself in A.H. 488. In A.H. 489 Mausil was besieged and taken by Kaww\u0101m ed Daulah Karbuka, a powerful Turkish adventurer formerly one of the nobles of Malik Shah, and whose name will perhaps be remembered by readers of Gibbon. The last Prince of his race, succeeded in escaping from the siege and obtained protection at Al Hillah from Seyf ed Din Sadakah, the refuge, as he was called by his contemporaries, of the unfortunate and of all that were in distress.\n\nBut it is necessary to return to an earlier period in the history of the 'Okaylis. At the commencement of the first century of the Hijrah, they and other tribes of the 'Amir ibn Sa'sa'ah, still occupied their original homes in Central Arabia. We find them with the Banu K\u016bs\u0101nah and Banu Ja'dah and in alliance with the Banu Nakh\u0101lah taking part in a savage war with the Banu Hanifah, a subtribe of the latter, the Banu D\u016bl, which broke out at the time of the Khal\u012bfah al Wal\u012bd's death in A.D. 743-4. The Banu Hanifah, who indeed were aggressors in the original quarrel, were eventually vanquished. But the final triumph of their enemies was assured by the appointment of a Governor to Yam\u0101mah, of the tribe of Faz\u0101rah, who, as the historian significantly remarks, therefore himself a Kay\u1e63i, and who crushed the remaining power of the Banu Hanifah with relentless severity.\n\nThe spirit of boastful defiance with which the Banu Hanifah resented the treatment to which they were subjected, shows itself in the following lines composed on occasion by one of their poets:\n\n\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0636\u0631\u0631\u0646\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0627\u0637 \u0641\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0627\n\u0644\u0642\u0648 \u0645\u062a\u0623 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0624\u0648\u0633 \u0641\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0627\n\u062a\u0637\u0631\u0639\u0646\u0627 \u0631\u0624\u0648\u0633\u0627 \u0645\u0646\u0643\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0644\u0627\u0645\nYe have scourged us with whips, but our blows have dealt with as slender but sharp cutting swords.\nTo humble us ye have shorn the hair from our heads,\nBut we have severed your heads from your bodies.\n\nIbn al Ath\u012br, vol. v. p. 228. The tribe of Hanifah was derived from...\nThe idea contained in the preceding lines bears a curiously close resemblance with the boast uttered many centuries later by the Turkish Grand Vizier to the Venetian ambassador, shortly after the destruction of the Turkish fleet at Lepanto, which had closely followed upon the capture of the island of Cyprus from the Christians: \"You have deprived us of our beards; but our beards will grow again, and we have struck off one of your limbs.\"\n\nAt about the same period as that of their feud with the Banu Hanifah, a branch of the 'Okaylis, was taking part in the civil war in Andalusia. On the appearance of the Pretender 'Abd ar Rahm\u0101n, they deserted, not indeed without provocation, the cause of the Amir Yusuf the Fihrite, and they took part in the re-establishment of the Umayyah Khalifate over the Arabs of Spain.\n\nThe tribes belonging to the great sept of 'Amir ibn Sa'sa'ah emigrated from Arabia into Syria during the first years of the 'Abassi dynasty, and it was in the plains of Bekr, son of Wa'il, and was descended from Rabi'ah, son of Nizar, whilst the 'Okaylis were, as already stated, one of the numerous tribes of the great sept of Kays 'Aylan, son of Modar, son of Nizar. Nizar was son of Ma'add, son of 'Adn\u0101n, the descendant of Ismail.\n\nIlyas and Kays 'Aylan were the two sons of Modar. They and Rabi'ah, brother of the latter, are the fathers of the three great stems into which the Arab posterity of Ismail are mainly divided. The tribe of Kuraysh, to which the Prophet Muhammad belonged, was descended from Ilyas. The main fact of the descent of 'Adn\u0101n from Ismail, the son of Abraham, is held to be beyond all dispute; but there is no authoritative teaching on the particulars of the line, nor even on the number of generations, between Ismail and 'Adn\u0101n. Genealogists are liars, is a traditional saying attributed to the Prophet, and he forbade all critical researches extending further back (see M. de Meynard's translation of Al Mas'udi, vol. iv. pp. 112 and 118).\n\nRespecting Ma'add a tradition is preserved, and is mentioned by Ibn Khald\u016bn, to the effect that when the Prophets Jeremiah and Baruch, under the inspiration of God, commanded Bukht Na\u1e63\u1e63ar to take vengeance upon the Arabs for their iniquities, and for the murder of the Prophet Shu'ayb, son of Mahdam, Ma'add was borne to a place of safety in Mesopotamia by the miraculous being Bur\u0101k, the same that subsequently carried Muhammad from Mecca to Jerusalem. Ma'add was thus favoured because from his loins was to spring a noble Prophet, the seal of the apostles, a decree which, continues the writer, received its fulfillment. (Ibn Khald\u016bn, vol. ii. pp. 30, 107, 237, 299-300.) See also Jeremiah xlix. 28; Isaiah xxii. 13 to 17, lx. 7; Judith ii. 23. (Caussin de Perceval, vol. i. p. 180.) Kaydh\u0101r and N\u016bbit were sons of Ismail. They may doubtless be identified with the biblical Kedar and Nahayoth. It is not known with certainty which was the ancestor of 'Adn\u0101n. (Ibn Khald\u016bn, vol. ii. p. 298.)\n\nThe Shu'ayb above mentioned, it must be remembered, is not the same as the prophet of the like name, who was sent to the Midianites.\n\n1 See Dozy's Histoire des Mussulmanes d'Espagne.\n2 Ibn Khald\u016bn, vol. vi. p. 11.\nHISTORY OF THE BANU 'OKAYL.\n\n'Ir\u0101k that the 'Okaylis attained a celebrity which placed them to a not unimportant place in the history of the first century of the Hijrah.\n\nIn the civil wars that followed upon the death of Khalifah Har\u016bn ar Rash\u012bd, Na\u1e63r ibn Sayy\u0101r ibn al-\u1e24asan al-'Okayli, upheld the cause of Al Am\u012bn, and contended against the opposition to Al Mam\u016bn even after the former's death. From a strongly fortified castle, Kais\u016bm, which he possessed on the north of Aleppo, he overran the surrounding country. Large numbers of Arab and other adventurers flocked to his standard, and with these reinforcements he crossed over to the eastern banks of the Euphrates. The celebrated general of Al Mam\u016bn, was sent against him in A.H. 199. A sanguinary battle was fought near Ar Rakkah, on the Euphrates, and the 'Okaylis suffered severely, but T\u0101hir was compelled to retreat to Ar Rakkah, on the Euphrates, and to confine himself with defending the country in his immediate neighbourhood. Na\u1e63r meanwhile increased in power, and was engaged by the contentions that prevailed throughout the empire. He continued for some time to defy the power of the Abbasids. At length, in A.H. 209, Kais\u016bm was closely invested by an army under the command of 'Abd Allah, son of Al Mam\u016bn. Na\u1e63r surrendered on a promise, confirmed by the Abbasids, of a free pardon for the past and of honourable treatment at Baghdad.\n\nWhen struggling against his powerful enemies, Na\u1e63r urged to strengthen himself by recognizing the authority of one of the pretenders to the Khalifate, either of the Ban\u016b 'Ali or of Umayyah. He refused, protesting that his only concern was the protection of the Arabs. He resisted the Abbasids, solely because they sacrificed the influence and authority of their own countrymen to those of foreigners. He had no means disposed to recognize the supremacy of an Abbasid pretender to reverence due only to the Creator and to the divine bounty, and as little to submit to any measure which would affect the family the fortunes of which were irretrievably gone.\n\n1 Ibn al Ath\u012br, vol. vi. pp. 274\u20135.\n2 Vol. vi. p. 216.\n\nVOL. XVIII.\u2014[NEW SERIES.]\nThe shadow of the coming supremacy of the northern races of Asia over the Muhammadan empire was in fact already visible. Both political and military power may thenceforward be said to have gradually departed from the hands of the Arabs, by whom it has never again been recovered. It may be said of the 'Abassi Khalifahs themselves that they soon retained little of Arab nationality but the name and the use of the Arabic language. Al Mam\u016bn was indeed himself the son of a Khorassani mother.\n\nOne of his subjects is said to have besought him, on one occasion, to extend the same favour to the Arabs of Syria as he displayed to the foreigners of Khorassan. \"My good friend,\" answered the Khalifah, \"you ask me more than is reasonable. The immediate result of my allowing the tribes of \u1e32ays to alight upon this country was that soon not a dirhem remained in the treasury.\" He here alluded, remarks the historian, to the insurrection of Na\u1e63r ibn Shabath. \"As to the tribes of Yaman,\" continued the Khalifah, \"I neither like them, nor have they any love for me. As for the people of \u1e32ud\u0101'ah, they are eagerly looking for the re-appearance of As Sufi\u0101ni with the purpose of supporting him in his pretensions. And as to the tribes of Rabi'ah, they have been rebels to God ever since his Prophet was raised from the seed of Mo\u1e0dar, and no two of them can enter into an undertaking but one of the two seeks a pretext of quarrel with the other. Begone, and evil fortune attend you!\"\u00b9\n\n\u1e32ud\u0101'ah is generally regarded as one of the Yamani tribes descended from \u1e24imyar. But the question has been much disputed, and, according to some authorities, they were Ismailian Arabs, descended from Ma'add, son of 'Adn\u0101n. The Yamani origin of the tribe is that most generally accepted, and it is said to be confirmed by the authority of the Prophet.\u00b2 It is stated that the mother of \u1e32ud\u0101'ah, the\n\n\u00b9 Ibn al Ath\u012br, vol. vi. p 305.

Lulu, who was Governor of Aleppo, Him\u015f, Kinnisserin and Diar Modar, rebelled against his master, and joined Al Muwaffiq, brother and vicegerent of the reigning Khalifah. Lulu delivered Kirgisia to Ahmad son of Malik ibn Tauk, but the latter in Shawwal of the same year was attacked at Ar Rahabah by Muhammad Ibn Abu's-Saj, governor of Al Anbar, on the Euphrates, and adjacent districts, and was driven into Syria. In A.H. 273, the jealousy that existed between Ibn Abu's-Saj and Ishak ibn Kundaj (or Kundajik), Governor of Mausil, brought about a war between them, in which each successively deserted the cause of the Abassids and recognized the supremacy of Khamaraweyh the Tulunite, receiving in reward assistance against his rival. Ibn Abu's-Saj was eventually defeated and compelled to seek refuge at Baghdad in A.H. 276, abandoning his dominions, which passed into the hands of Ibn Kundaj. The date of the dinar may perhaps authorize us to infer that Ibn Safwan during the struggle between the two rivals was allowed to regain possession of the city.\n\nAbout the year 286 the 'Okaylis and other Arabs of the Kaisy stem recognized the spiritual and temporal authority of Abu Sa'id al Jannabi, the founder of the Carmathian dynasty in Arabia. With their assistance he besieged and conquered Hajar. He soon afterwards added Katif, then the whole of Bahrayn, and ere long he established a power on the shores of the Persian Gulf, which became the terror of the Muhammadan world.\n\nBut the Carmathian dominion, as is well known, was almost as remarkable for the rapidity of its decline as for that of its rise. The dissensions that followed after the death of Al Jannabi, in A.H. 332, increased in violence after the death, in A.H. 366, of his grandson, Abu Ali al Hasan\n\n---\n\n1 Malik ibn Tauk, of the tribe of Taghlib, was a military commander under Harun ar Rashid, and a lineal descendant of Amru ibn Kulthum, a celebrated poet and warrior of the Ante-Islamic period and author of one of the seven Mu'allakat.

They returned to their former obedience A.H. 375, but their power had now completely broken. In A.H. 378 they were attacked, at the instigation Abassis, by a Taghlabite chief Abu\u2019l \u1e24asan al- According to Ibn Khald\u016bn,\u00b9 he possessed himself capital Al A\u1e25sa, and the writer adds that Al A\u1e63far descendants thenceforward held the Carmathians in of complete subjection. That statement is not bo by the evidence of other historians,\u00b2 nor by that traveller N\u0101\u1e63ir Khusruw, who visited Al A\u1e25sa in A. and it seems more probable that the dominion Taghlabite chiefs did not extend beyond the exact tribute.\u00b3\n\nAmong the Arab tribes, or sections of tribes, that c the province of Bahrayn and its neighbourhood, th Sulaym and Banu \u2018Okayl were for warlike streng second to the Taghlibis. After the defeat of the thians, Al A\u1e63far prevailed upon the \u2018Okaylis to combi him, and with their aid he drove the Banu Sulaym the country. They joined the rest of their tribe in and thence passed over into Africa as already stat A\u1e63far, having got rid of one of his rivals, now turned the other. The \u2018Okaylis were in their turn attack driven forth.

They had, however, been preceded by many other Arab settlers, and, among others, by the tribe of Taghlib. The latter and its sister-tribe the Banu Bekr (supra, p. 499, note) were the two subdivisions of the Banu W\u0101-il, and belonged therefore to the great stem of Rabi\u2018ah, brother of Modar and son of Niz\u0101r. They settled in that portion of Mesopotamia known as Di\u0101r Rabi\u2018ah, the abode of Rabi\u2018ah, before the advent of Isl\u0101m.\\(^1\\) They had adopted Christianity, entered into alliances with the Romans, and, along with the Ghass\u0101nis, they fought against the Muslims, when the latter invaded and conquered Syria. The Khalifah Omar imposed upon them the Jizyah, or capitation tax, exacted according to Muhammadan law from Jewish and Christian subjects; but at the entreaties of the Taghlibites, to spare them the humiliation which the term Jizyah inflicted upon them in the eyes of the Arabs, he consented to the tax being levied under the name of double tithes.\\(^2\\)\n\nIn the third century of the Hijrah, an ambitious and powerful chief, \u1e24amd\u0101n ibn \u1e24amd\u016bn, raised himself to eminence among the Banu Taghlib, and laid the foundations of the Hamdani Principality of Mausil and Aleppo. During the greater part of the following century, the Hamdanis held a position of acknowledged supremacy over the Arab tribes that had spread themselves on the plains between Mesopotamia and Syria, and on the banks of the Euphrates. The Banu \u1e6cay as well as the \u2018Okaylis, the Banu Kilab, the Banu Numayr and the Khaf\u0101jahs, were, in the words of Ibn Khald\u016bn, the subjects of the Hamdanis, paying them tribute and supplying them with military aid.\\(^3\\) But the rule of the Hamdani Princes, brilliant as it was under the two brothers, N\u0101\u1e63ir ed Daulah al \u1e24usayn and Seyf ed Daulah Ali, the Princes of Mausil and of Aleppo, did not long\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The district occupied by the Banu Bekr received the name of Di\u0101r Bekr.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ibn Khald\u016bn, vol. iv. p. 227.

Mau\u015fil was taken in A.H. 367 by Daulah the Buweyhi. Abu Taghlib fled from accompanied by a strong party of his followers, various wanderings, arrived in 369 in Syria. Then summoned by the Fatimite Khalifah Al \u2018Aziz to invitation which he hesitated to obey. A consider of the \u2018Okayli tribe were at the time encamped plains of Southern Syria. They had incurred the s of Ibn Daghfal, chief of the Ta-yites, and applied Taghlib for his assistance. He encamped in their hood, whereupon Ibn Daghfal in alarm marched them. The \u2018Okaylis, perceiving the large numbers deserted their ally en masse and left him to face the enemy with his followers alone, numbering in all a men. They were completely defeated, and Abu Tagl self taken prisoner. Ibn Daghfal, fearing that would treat his prisoner with the same clemency shown to Alftakin (supra p. 497), put him to death head was sent to Cairo. The sister of Abu Taghlib, and his wife, who was daughter of his uncle Seyf fell into the hands of the \u2018Okaylis. They sent the ed Daulah, who had succeeded his father in the Pri of Aleppo.

T ment she received at the hands of \u2018Adad ed Daulah as would hardly be expected from a far more ruler. Having undergone about two years\u2019 impr she was drowned in the Tigris, after being carried the streets of Baghdad, mounted on a camel, whi proclaimed: \u201cThis is Princess Ugly (Kab\u012bhah), the Discomfited (Abu Maghl\u00fcb),\u201d\u2014a brutal play own and her brother\u2019s names, Jam\u012bl\u0101h (Camilla), and Taghlib, Victor or more literally Vinces.\n\nThe power of the Hamd\u0101ni dynasty fell now into complete decay, and the tribes hitherto under their\nrecovered their independence and the power to seek the fulfilment each of its own ambition.\u00b9 The Banu Ta-y established themselves in the district extending from Ramleh to Egypt. \u015e\u00fclih ibn Mird\u016bs, Chief of the Banu Kil\u0101b, took possession of the country between Aleppo and \u2018\u0100nah on the Euphrates. In A.H. 414 he succeeded in possessing himself of Aleppo, where he and his descendants ruled until the dynasty came to an end in A.H. 473, when Sharaf ed Daulah Muslim, son of Kuraysh, the \u2018Okayli, took the city and held it for a short time under the supremacy of Malik Shah.\n\nIn A.H. 379 the Amir of the \u2018Okaylis was Abu\u2019dh Dhaww\u0101d Muhammad, son of Al Musayyib, son of R\u0101fi\u2018, son of Al Mukallid, son of Ja\u2019fir, son of \u2018Omar, son of Muhanna.\u00b2 The sons of Na\u1e63ir ed Daulah the Hamd\u0101ni, Abu Abd Allah and Abu T\u0101hir, had that year recovered possession of Mausil, but, threatened by the neighbouring Kurds, they applied to the \u2018Okayli chief for assistance, which he granted, receiving as his reward the towns of Nasibin, Jazirat ibn \u2018Omar and Balad.\n\nAided by Abu\u2019dh Dhaww\u0101d, the Hamd\u0101nis attacked the Kurdish army, which was defeated and put to flight. The Hamd\u0101nis endeavoured to follow up their success over their enemies, but the latter were in their turn victorious. Abu Abd Allah was taken prisoner. Abu T\u0101hir fled in the direction of Na\u1e63ibin. Here he was attacked by his late ally Abu\u2019dh Dhaww\u0101d, who took him prisoner and put him to death. Abu\u2019dh Dhaww\u0101d then marched upon Mausil, and took possession of the city and of the surrounding country.\n\nHis first act was to recognize the supremacy of the Buwayhi Prince Baha ed Daulah, and at his request an official was sent from Baghdad as Governor of the Province.\n\n\u00b9 Ibn Khald\u016bn, vol. iv. p. 272; Ibn al Ath\u012br, vol. ix. p. 162.\n\u00b2 Ibn Khallikan in his life of Al Mukallid gives the remainder of the chief\u2019s pedigree as follows, namely, Al Muhanna Abd er Rahm\u0101n, son of Burayd, son of Abd Allah, son of Zayd, son of Kays, son of Jutha, son of Tahfa, son of Hazn, son of \u2018Okayl. Reckoning three generations to a century, we arrive at A.D. 424, as the period of Amir ibn \u0160a\u2019sa\u2019ah, the great-grandfather of \u2018Okayl, a fair approximation to M. Caussin de Perceval\u2019s calculations, according to which Amir ibn \u0160a\u2019sa\u2019ah was born about A.D. 381. It will be observed that this pedigree does not confirm Ibn Sa\u2018id\u2019s statement that the Princes of Mausil belonged to the \u2018Okayli subtribe of \u2018Obadah.\nThe representative of Baha ed Daulah was, however no more than nominal authority, and all real power cised by Abu\u2019dh Dhaww\u0101d. An army was consequ long despatched by the Buwayhi prince against the and it recaptured Mau\u1e63il towards the end of A.H. 36.\n\nAbu\u2019dh Dhaww\u0101d died in 386, and the \u2018Okaylis r his brother Ali as his successor to the chieftainship, to admit a claim put forward by Al Mukallid, a brother. The latter induced his brother to join an attack upon Mau\u1e63il. He had contrived to considerable portion of the garrison from their a The governor fled down the river, anxious only to private property, and the two brothers took p the city. It was agreed between them that the sovereignty should belong to them jointly, with p to Ali. The latter returned to his encampment, h brother in possession.\n\nAl Mukallid defeated a force despatched against Baghdad, but sent excuses and professions of l Baha ed Daulah. The latter was sufficiently oc defending himself against his brother, \u015eamsam ed and found it expedient to grant terms of p ambitious and energetic Arab chief. It was ag Al Mukallid should be appointed ruler over Mau\u015f Al Kasr, and Jami\u2018\u0101n, that he should be invested regal dress of honour, that he should receive the Hus\u0101m ed Daulah (the Sword of the Empire), he should pay a tribute of 10,000 dinars. It was stipulated that he should exact from the towns control no more than the customary dues lawfully to him as their protector. This last obligation was ing to a remark of the historian, completely neglect\n\nFresh disputes had meanwhile broken out bet Mukallid and Ali, the latter supported by t ir \u1e24asan. Al Mukallid now resolved to possess his person of his rival. The two brothers were occupi\n\n1 Ibn al Athir, vol. ix. p. 89.\ntiguous houses at Mausil. Al Mukallid broke through the partition wall, seized his brother Ali, who was indulging in a debauch, and was helpless from the effects of wine, and imprisoned him. He then forthwith sent word to his wife, who was at an encampment he possessed four parasangs from Tekrit, on the Euphrates, between Mausil and Baghdad, desiring her immediately to escape with his two sons, Kirwash and Badr\u0101n, and to seek safety within the walls of the town from the attempts he foresaw would be made against them by their uncle \u1e24asan. The latter, in fact, on hearing of what had occurred at Mausil, hastened to the encampment, but arrived too late.\n\nThe two brothers, each supported by a portion of the tribe, now prepared for open war. Their armies advanced to within one stage of one another, and halted near \u2019Alth, on the eastern side of the Tigris. Here Al Mukallid was joined by several of the leading men of the tribe, and among others by his kinsmen the two brothers Abu Dir'a R\u0101fi' and Abu Sinan Gharib, sons of Muhammad, son of Ma'n. Opinions were divided as to the wisdom of having recourse to violence, whereby a civil war must inevitably be kindled in the tribe. Whilst they were disputing, a message was brought to Al Mukallid that his sister Rahilah had come and desired to see him. He immediately mounted and joined her, and through her influence peace was concluded. Friendship was sworn between the brothers. Ali was set at liberty, his property restored to him, and he returned to his tents.\n\nAl Mukallid now set out against Abu'l Hasan Ali ibn Mazya'd the Asadi, who during these troubles had espoused the cause of Ali, and had made incursions into Al Mukallid's territories. But the 'Okayli chief soon received tidings that Ali, taking advantage of his absence, had marched upon Mausil, and had succeeded in obtaining possession of the town. He immediately turned back and his two brothers in alarm made fresh offers of peace which were accepted. Ali died in A.H. 390, and Al \u1e24asan took his place as nominal chief of the tribe, but was attacked and speedily put to flight by Al Mukallid, aided by the Banu Khafajah. The\nlatter continued henceforward in undisputed posse\nthe Principality of Mausil and of the chieftainship\ntribe of 'Okayl, until he perished in A.H. 391 (A.D.)\nassassinated by his Turkish mamluks at Al Aub\nMuqallid's dominions included, at the time of hi\nbesides Mausil, the cities of Ka\u1e63r, K\u016bfah, Al Jami\nAnb\u0101r, Al Mad\u0101-in and Dak\u016bka.\u00b9 He was succeeded\nson Mo'tamad ed Daulah Abu Mani' Kirwash, who\nprolonged itself until A.H. 442, when he was dep\nhis brother Za'im ed Daulah Abu K\u0101mil.\n\nA translation into German of Ibn Khald\u016bn's histor\n'Okayli Principality of Mausil was published som\nago by M.

See also Professor Tiesenhausen's note No. 17).\n\nAbu Abd Allah Muhammad, son of Ma'n, died in A.H. 401 (A.D. 1010), at the age, it is alleged, of 110 years. He is said to have been present with the Carmathians when they removed the Black Stone from the temple of Mecca, an event which occurred in A.H. 317. He is described as a man of extreme avarice.\n\nI have had occasion to mention his two sons, Abu Sinan Gharib and Abu Dir\u0101' R\u0101fi'. The former, who held, as will presently be seen, the double title of Kam\u0101l ed Daulah and Seyf ed din, appears to have been born about the year 355. He witnessed therefore, and probably took an active part in, the rise of the 'O\u1e33ayli power under Abu'dh Dhaww\u0101d; but we first hear of him in A.H. 387, when, as before mentioned, he and his brother R\u0101fi' took part in the dissensions between Al Mukallid and \u1e24asan, the sons of Al Musayyib. On that occasion, we are told, R\u0101fi' was in favour of war, whilst Ghar\u012bb recommended a settlement of the dispute by peaceful means.\n\nIn A.H. 411 we find Ghar\u012bb in alliance with Nur ed Daulah Dubays the Asadi. Aided by troops from Baghdad, they attacked Ghar\u012bb's kinsman Kirw\u0101sh, the Prince of Mausil, and utterly defeated him. Kirw\u0101sh and R\u0101fi', son of Al Husayn and cousin of Ghar\u012bb, were both taken prisoners, but through Ghar\u012bb's influence they were soon released. The allies, however, followed up their victory by the capture of Takr\u012bt. Six years later Kirwash had again to defend himself against the Asadis, who on this occasion were aided by the Banu Khaf\u0101ji. This was followed in the same year by an alliance between R\u0101fi' ibn al Husayn, seconded by an 'Okayli chief, Najdat ed Daulah ibn Kur\u0101d, and Badr\u0101n the brother of Kirwash. The latter was, however, on the present occasion, supported by Abu Sin\u0101n Ghar\u012bb, and by reinforcements supplied to him by the Merwanis, placing a total force of 13,000 men at his command. The two armies met near\nBalad (on the Tigris, seven parasangs from Ma\u1e63il), and an indecisive action was fought, in which heavy losses were suffered on both sides. A pause ensued, and a dramatic scene followed, which brought the war to an end. Najdat ed Daulah stepped forward and embraced Gharib between the arrayed ranks. Abu'l Fa\u1e0dl Badr\u0101n did the same to his brother Kirwash, and terms of peace were soon arranged.\n\nThe full name and title of the hero on that occasion, as they may be gathered from a comparison of the passages in which he is mentioned (Ibn al Athir, vol. ix. pp. 116, 249, 265 and 297), seems to have been Najdat ed Daulah Kamil Abu Mans\u016br Tharw\u0101n, son of Kur\u0101d. It seems probable that he is the same person as is afterwards mentioned (pp. 402 and 410) as Kamil ibn Muhammad ibn al Musayyib, Prince of Al Hazirah. The latter must, however, almost unquestionably have been son of Abu Dhaww\u0101d, whilst Najdat ed Daulah is represented as son of Kur\u0101d, a name which nowhere else appears. The difficulty may perhaps be overcome when it is considered how easily in Arab manuscript the word \u062a\u0631\u06a9 may be misread for \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0631\u062f. The hostility of Najdat ed Daulah to Kirwash may be explained by the ingratitude and scandalous treachery with which the latter requited the services he received from his kinsman, on the death of his father, Al Mu\u1e33allid, in A.H. 391.\n\nIn the unsuccessful campaign of Kirwash against the Banu Khafajah, which followed immediately after the events above related, and which resulted in the loss of his possessions on the Euphrates, he was again supported by Gharib.\n\nIn 420 Nur ed Daulah Dubays the Asad\u012b, who had involved himself in hostilities with Jal\u0101l ed Daulah the Buwayhi, fled for refuge to Najdat ed Daulah, by whom he was placed under the protection of Abu Sin\u0101n Gharib, and\n\n---\n\n1 Al Hazirah was a town two days' journey from Baghdad, on the road to Ma\u1e63il. Ibn Kur\u0101d is spoken of in 391 and 420 as dwelling at Sindiyah, and Kamil in 410 as possessing an encampment at Bard\u0101n. Both these places are in the neighbourhood of Baghdad, and at a short distance from one another.\n\n2 See Ibn al Athir, vol. ix. p. 116.\nthrough the latter's influence and assistance, Dubays was restored to his dominions.\n\nIn the following year strife again broke out between Gharib himself and his cousin Abu'l Musayyib R\u0101fi', son of Husayn. Gharib collected a strong force of Arabs and Kurds, and with further reinforcements of well-appointed troops supplied to him by Jal\u0101l ed Daulah, he laid siege to Takrit, a town on the Tigris above Baghdad, which was subject to R\u0101fi'. The latter had gone to Mau\u0161il, where he obtained the alliance of Kirwash, with whom he marched against the enemy. On their approach, Gharib abandoned the siege and fell upon the army of the allies. Through the treachery of some of his own people, who seized the opportunity to attack and plunder his baggage and that of the Buwayhi troops, Gharib was defeated and put to flight. He was pursued by Kirwash and R\u0101fi' to his Bedouin encampment, which, however, they not only refrained from molesting, but actually protected from injury. Peace was soon concluded, and friendly relations between them resumed.\n\nIn 423, when Jal\u0101l ed Daulah Abu T\u0101hir the Buwayhi was driven out of Baghdad by the Turkish soldiers, he took refuge at 'Okbara, a town on the eastern bank of the Tigris, not far from Baghdad, which, as will presently be seen, appears to have been subject at that time to Gharib, whilst his waz\u012br, Abu Ishaq es Sahali, fled to the Arab chief's tents. Jal\u0101l ed Daulah remained at 'Okbara forty-three days, at the end of which, the Khutbah having been restored in his name, he returned to Baghdad.\n\nAbu Sin\u0101n Gharib died in A.H. 425 at Samarra, aged seventy years, leaving in treasure alone a sum of 500,000 dinars. He is stated to have been succeeded by his son Abu 'r Ray\u0101n, of whom there appears to be no further record. Another son is however mentioned by Ibn al Ath\u012br, Abu'l Hindi Bilal, who in A.H. 441 was in possession of the towns of \u1e24arba, Nahr Bey\u1e6dar and Aw\u0101na,\u00b9 granted to him\n\n\u00b9 'Okbara and Aw\u0101na are situated on the opposite banks of the Tigris about ten parasangs above Baghdad. Harba and Nahr Bey\u1e6dar were two small towns at a short distance from the others.\nby Za'im ed Daulah Abu Kamil, the brother and s\nof Kirwash.\n\nIbn al Athir states that Gharib bore the lakab of\nDaulah. Elsewhere (p. 288 b) he calls him K.\nDaulah. He goes on to say that Gharib struck dir\nwhich he gave the name of Seyfiyyah (sword pie\nbecame possessed some years ago of a dirhem s'\n'Okbara in A.H. 422, which seems to be one of these\ncoins, and which, as far as my knowledge goes, is\nspecimen of the coinage of the Princes of the fa\nMa'n known to be extant.

Jal\u0101l ed Daulah was proclaimed successor to his brother Musharrif ed Daulah on the latter's death in Rab\u012b' al Awwal, 416; but it was not until the month of Ramadan, 418, that he ventured or was able to enter Baghdad and to assume the direction of the Government. His reign was chiefly marked by gross insubordination on the part of his Turkish troops. They repeatedly rose against him, and he was more than once compelled to fly from the city, whilst the soldiery broke down the gates of his palace and plundered it. On one occasion they attacked his wazir 'Umayd ed Daulah. They beat him, drove him from his house barefooted, dragged his clothes off his back, tore up his turban and wrenched off his rings with such violence that his fingers bled. The wazir threw himself at the feet of his master, complaining of the treatment he had undergone. \"I am the son of Baha ed Daulah,\" answered the latter, \"and I have suffered even greater indignity.\" Jalal ed Daulah died in A.H. 435. \"Whoever,\" remarks the historian, \"considers the weakness of his character, the violence to which he was subjected, and the lengthened period over which his reign was nevertheless prolonged, must clearly perceive that God's power encompasseth all things, that He gireth sovereignty unto whom He willeth and that He taketh it from whom He willeth\" (Kuran iii. 25).\u00b9\n\nThe title Shahin Shah, which appears upon the coin, was commonly borne by the Buwayhis, and both it and its Arabic equivalent, Malik al Mul\u016bk, King of Kings, are to be found on the coinage of Baha ed Daulah. It seems somewhat singular to read that, when in A.H. 429 Jalal ed Daulah applied for a grant of the Arabic rendering of the title, as openly borne by his father, the Khal\u012bfah displayed the utmost unwillingness, and finally referred the question of its lawfulness to the decision of five jurists. A majority of four decided in the affirmative, and the title was consequently inserted in the Khutbah, but the question is said to have been obstinately disputed by the dissentient.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Ibn al Athir, vol. ix. pp. 288b, 352. \u00b2 Ibid. vol. ix. p. 312.\nHISTORY OF THE BANU 'OKAYL.\n\nGharib's brother Shah\u0101b ed Daulah Abu Dir'a in 406.

Bedr Shahab ed Daulah a message, in which, after a to the friendship that existed between him and his father, he reproached him with harbouring an enemy desired him to expel Abu'l Fath. The Arab refused. Bedr thereupon sent an army to his territories, sit the eastern bank of the Tigris. The country was plundered.

He is described as remarkable for bravery and for determination of character. He had lost one of his hands, which was accidentally struck off by the slave of a kinsman at a drinking party, in the course of a quarrel over which the disputants had drawn their swords, and which R\u0101fi' was endeavouring to appease. An artificial hand was made for him, with which he was able to manage his horse, and the loss did not incapacitate him from taking his part in battle.\n\nThe following is given by Ibn al Athir as a specimen of his poetic talents:\n\n\u0644\u0627 \u0631\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u063a\u0641\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u063a\u0645\u0633 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0645\u0631\n\u0648\u0633\u0627\u0631\u0645 \u0637\u0631\u0628 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0632\u0627\u0644 \u062c\u0641\u0646\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0631 \u0633\u064a\u0646\u0627 \u0642\u0637 \u0646\u0649 \u062c\u0641\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u063a\u0631\u0649\n\u0641\u0642\u062f\u062a \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0633 \u062a\u062d\u062f\u062c \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0636\u064a \u0627\u0639\u062f\u0649 \u0644\u0641\u0642\u062f\u0649 \u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0637\u0639\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0628\u0631\n\u0633\u0627\u0646\u0641\u062a \u0631\u064a\u0639\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0628\u064a\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0646\u0641\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0637\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0648\u0637\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062c\u0631\n\u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0646 \u0644\u064a\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0627 \u062a\u0645\u0632 \u0628\u0644\u0627 \u0646\u0641\u0639 \u0648\u062a\u062d\u0633\u0628 \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0630\u0631\u064a\n\n\"The dew upon her lips (I implore forgiveness of God!)\nIs sweeter and more enticing to the soul than wine.\nPiercing glances never cease to dart forth from beneath her eyelids:\nThose eyes, keen-edged swords, which wound without quitting their sheaths.\nI exclaimed as the morn's grey light came bearing forth a new day,\nBe disdainful over my absence by virtue of the cruel indifference thou displayest!\nHenceforth my days of youth will be directed to the noble object\nOf seeking a high estate, of earning the brilliant rewards of ambition.\nIs it not a signal loss that my nights pass away in vain desires,\nAnd yet are counted against me in the reckoning of my life?\"\nR\u0101fi\u2018 was succeeded by his nephew, Abu Man\u2018ah R\nson of Taghlib, who, it is said, found in his uncle\u2019s t:\nat Takrit a sum of upwards of 500,000 dinars, b\nand silver plate.\\(^1\\) Kham\u012bs was living in exile at th\nof R\u0101fi\u2018\u2019s death, and the first use he made of his inh\nwas to conciliate his suzerain, Jal\u0101l ed Daulah, v\noffering of 80,000 dinars.\n\nIt may here be observed that these Arab chiefs,\nexercising rulership over principalities, towns, and ou\ndistricts, did not abandon their national habits, but co\nto live with their families in tents and in the midst o\ntribesmen.

He applied to his suzerain, Jalal ed Daulah, for assistance, which was granted, and thanks to which, but still more to the dissensions that broke out within the tribe, Kham\u012bs was eventually allowed to remain unmolested. He died in A.H. 435, and was succeeded by his son, Abu Ghashsham. The latter's brother '\u012asa, in A.H. 444, rose against him, obtained possession of the citadel, and placed Abu Ghashsham in confinement.\n\nToghrul Beg entered Baghdad in Shawwal, 447, having destroyed the last vestige of the Buwayhi power, and imprisoned Malik er Ra\u1e25\u012bm, the last prince of the dynasty. But the Seljuk Sultan had still to overcome the opposition of Al Basasiry, a powerful Buwayhi noble, one of whose most important allies was Nur ed Daulah Dubays, who had given him his daughter in marriage, and who was impelled both by his ambition, but in a still greater degree by his apprehensions, to support the cause of his kinsman. Kuraysh, son of Badran, the 'Okayli prince, had declared himself for the Seljuks, but he was attacked near Sinjar, was defeated and wounded, and surrendered himself to his antagonists. He was honourably treated, and they persuaded him to join their cause. They accompanied him to Mau\u1e63il, where the supremacy of the Egyptian Khal\u012bfah was formally proclaimed, the Khutbah recited from the pulpits in the name of Al Mustan\u1e63ir, and where they were rewarded by the receipt from Cairo of dresses of honour.\n\nToghrul Beg had however determined to deal in person with the rebels. He set forth from Baghdad towards the end of A.H. 448, about thirteen months after his arrival in the city. He reached Takr\u012bt, now under the rule of Na\u1e63r, son of '\u012asa, son of Kham\u012bs, and prepared to lay siege to the city. Na\u1e63r saved himself by displaying from his battlements the black ensign of the Abassis, and by another and more tangible token of his allegiance, the presentation to Toghrul Beg of a sum of money. It was accepted and the Turkish Sultan proceeded on his way.\n\nThese events were almost immediately succeeded by the\ndeath of Na\u1e63r. His mother Am\u012brah, who was daughter of Abu Sinan Ghar\u012bb, rather than allow Abu Ghashsh\u0101l to recover possession of Takrit, put him to death, and delivered the town to Abu'l Ghan\u0101-im, who subsequently became a faithful adherent of the Abassids, and by whom it was given over to Toghrul Beg. Am\u012brah afterwards married \u1e32\u016bs\u0101n son of Badran, and is said to have been killed at Ma\u1e63\u0101fah, the son of Abu Ghashsham, in revenge for the death of his father.\n\nI find mention of only two other members of the family of Ma\u02bfn, Az Zurayr and Ma\u1e6dar, who are described as sons of Ali, son of Ma\u02bfn. They allied themselves with So\u02bf\u012bd, son of Abu\u02besh Sh\u014dk, the Kurdish Chief, in his struggle against his uncle Muhalhal, and it was at their instigation and with their assistance that a battle was fought, in which Ma\u02bfn was taken prisoner.\u00b9\n\nI may conclude this sketch of the history of the 'O\u1e33ayl\u012bs of 'Ir\u0101\u1e33 with the mention of two other personages, descendants of Al Mukallid son of Ja\u02befir, but who belonged neither to the family of Musayyib nor to that of Ma\u02bfn. One of them was Muhammad, son of R\u0101fi\u02bf, son of Rif\u0101\u02bfa, son of D\u016br\u0101n, son of M\u0101lik, son of Al Mukallid. He was governor of the city of Hit, on the Euphrates, on behalf of Wahb, son of Wahaybah, an 'O\u1e33ayli chief who had received a grant of the city from Sultan Barkiaruk. Seyf ed Daulah \u0160adal\u0131 fixed his mind upon obtaining possession of the city, and in A.H. 496 he overcame the resistance of the 'O\u1e33ayl\u012bs and accomplished his object.\u00b2\n\nThe other was Mu\u1e25y ed d\u012bn Abu\u02bel H\u0101rith Muh\u0101r\u012bsh son of Al Mujalli, also a descendant of Al Mukallid, son of Ja\u02befir. Toghrul Beg had in A.H. 450 gone in pursuit of \u1e24\u0101rith ibn Ibrahim Nay\u0101l to Hamadan. Al Basasiri seized the opportunity to enter Baghdad. He made himself master of the city and proclaimed the supremacy of Al Mu\u1e25ammad. The white banner of the Fatimites was everywhere displayed, and the Khutbah recited in the mosques.\n\n\u00b9 Ibn al Athir, vol. ix. p. 404.\n\u00b2 Ibn al Athir, vol. x. p. 247.\nname of the heretical Khalifah of Cairo, who won the brilliant though but short-lived triumph of being solemnly recognized, in the capital and centre of Muhammadanism, as the lawful head of Isl\u0101m.\n\nThe situation of the Abassi Khalifah had from the first moment of these events became one of imminent peril. In this extremity his wazir, known as the Ra-is er Ru-as\u0101, turned for help to the \u2018O\u1e33ayli Prince Kuraysh, son of Badran. Addressing him by his title, \u2018Alam ed din, Banner of the Faith, he declared to him that God was conferring upon him an honour which no Prince had ever yet received. \u201cThe Commander of the Faithful places himself, his family and friends under your protection, the protection of God, of his Prophet, and of an Arab.\u201d Such an appeal could not be rejected, and Kuraysh, removing his mitre-shaped cap (Kalans\u016bwah), sent it to the Khalifah, handing his staff of command to the Ra-is er Ru-as\u0101, as pledges of his protection. The Khalifah was mounted, wearing the black robes of the Abassis and the burdah, or sacred mantle of the Prophet, and with the black banner floating over him, he was conducted to the \u2018O\u1e33ayli camp along with his wife Arslan Khatun, the niece of Toghrul Beg. Kuraysh, it must be added, in spite of his pledges, handed over the Ra-is er Ru-as\u0101 to Al Basasiri, by whom the unhappy wazir was put to a cruel and ignominious death.\n\nA place of greater safety had to be found for the Khalifah. Kuraysh placed him under the care of Muh\u0101r\u012bsh, by whom he was conveyed to Hadithat-\u2018\u0100nah, of which Muh\u0101r\u012bsh was ruler.\u00b9 There he remained until his restoration at the end of a period of twelve months.\n\nMuh\u0101r\u012bsh, who throughout his life was held in great respect, died in A.H. 499, at the age of about eighty years, and was succeeded by his son Suleyman. The latter died in A.H. 528. The family of the \u2018O\u1e33ayli Princes of Mau\u1e63il was now virtually extinct, and we find Suleyman spoken of not only as Prince of \u1e24ad\u012bthah, but also as Amir of his tribe.\n\n\u00b9 Hadithah and \u2018\u0100nah are two towns on the Euphrates, about thirty-five miles from one another.\nHe was succeeded by his sons, who, at their insta\nwere carried in procession through the streets of Ba\nin recognition of the services rendered by their gran\nto the Khalifate. Nevertheless, they continued in po\nof \u1e24adithah only until A.H. 536, when the Atabek \u2018I\ndin Zenki took possession of the town, and remov\ndescendants of Muh\u0101rish to Ma\u1e63\u012bl.\n\nThe last of the \u2018Okaylis to hold anything like j\nrank was a descendant of Badr\u0101n, son of Al Mukal\nbrother of Kirwash. In A.H. 478 the castle of A\nheld by S\u0101lim, son of M\u0101lik, son of Badran. It ha\nplaced under his charge by his chief and kinsman, Sl\nDaulah Muslim, and it continued in his hands af\ndeath of Sharaf ed Daulah, who was killed towa\nbeginning of that year in a battle fought with the T\nPrince of K\u014dniyah (Iconium). In the following y\ncity of Aleppo was taken by Malik Shah. The citadel\nthe command of S\u0101lim, continued to hold out, l\neventually surrendered to the Sultan in exchange\nCastle of Ja\u2018bir, a fortress of great strength, built on a\noverlooking the eastern bank of the Euphrates, a\ndistance above the town of Rakka\u1e25. It had been t\nMalik Shah, from an Arab of the tribe of K\u016bshayr (e\nof the Banu \u2018Okayl) on his march to Aleppo. Its o\nblind old man, was a notorious robber, who, togeth\nhis two sons and other followers, was put to death by\nShah.\n\nS\u0101lim took possession of the castle, and soon aft\nrendered himself master also of Rakka\u1e25. According\nArab chronicler, Baldwin, Count of Edessa (Bohem\nwas in A.H. 502 (?) placed under the custody of Sl\nDaulah S\u0101lim at the castle of Ja\u2018bir, until the su\nof his kinsman Joscelin, who was to remain as he\npayment of his ransom.\u00b9\n\nShortly afterwards Rakka\u1e25 was attacked and ca\nthe Banu Numayr, and Ali, the son of S\u0101lim, who\ncommand of the town, was killed. Shams ed Daulal\n\n\u00b9 Ibn al Ath\u012br, vol. x. p. 322.\ndied in A.H. 519, and appears to have been succeeded by his grandson, Malik, son of Ali. In A.H. 541 the castle was besieged by the Atabek 'Im\u0101d ed din Zenki. Its strength defying all his efforts to capture it, he tried the effect of alternate promises and threats. Before any result could be arrived at, the Atabek was assassinated in his tent by a party of his own Mamluks, an event which brought the siege of the castle to an end.\n\n'Im\u0101d ed din's son, and successor to the sovereignty of Aleppo, Nur ed din Mahmud, was more successful. Malik had, in 563, left the protection of the castle, on a hunting expedition, when he was set upon by a party of Banu Kil\u0101b, who carried him off and delivered him into the hands of Nur ed din. The Atabek laid siege to the castle, but failed in his attempts to capture it. But he was more fortunate than his father in dealing with its owner, who was now in his power. The same policy of alternate promises and threats at length brought matters to a successful issue. Malik surrendered the fortress, and received in exchange the town of Sar\u016bj, a sum of 20,000 dinars in cash, and the revenues of the salt deposits in the neighbourhood of Buz\u0101\u2018ah near Aleppo.\u00b9\n\nIbn Khald\u016bn tells us that when the \u2018Okayli power in Mesopotamia and \u2018Ir\u0101k was destroyed, and their dominions appropriated by the Seljuks, the tribe returned to its original home in Bahrayn. The Taghlibite sovereignty exercised by the descendants of Abu\u2019l \u1e24asan al Asfar had ere this fallen into a state of complete decay, and was easily overthrown. The country was subdued by the \u2018Okaylis, and, together with the district of Yam\u0101mah, which they conquered from the Banu Kil\u0101b, it was ruled for several generations by a family known as the Banu \u2018Asf\u016br, belonging to the sub-tribe of Banu \u2018\u0100mir, son of \u2018Okayl. Ibn Khald\u016bn adds a quotation from Ibn Sa\u2018id to the effect that, when at Medinah in 651, he was informed by natives of Bahrayn\n\n\u00b9 Sar\u016bj is a town near Harran, in the modern province of Orfah or Edessa. It is famed in Arabic literature as the reputed native place of Abu Zayd es Sar\u016bji, the hero of the Maq\u0101mat of Hariri.\nthat their country was at that time still under the rule of the family of \u2018A\u1e63f\u016br, Princes of Al Ahsa.\n\nSo far as I am able to discover, little or nothing has been added from existing Arab histories to the meagre account given by Ibn Khald\u016bn of the expedition of the T\u0101\u2019if al A\u1e63far against the Carmathians. (Supra, p. 505.)\n\nI may here add that, in the absence in England of any complete MS. copy of Ibn Khald\u016bn\u2019s work, I have been almost wholly dependent, in collecting these notes on the history of the \u2018Okayli tribe, upon the edition of Ibn Khald\u016bn printed at Bulak. It is a work for which all students of Eastern history may well feel grateful. But it is unfortunately disfigured by innumerable and palpable errors, which may no doubt be traced to the MSS. from which the present edition has been printed, but in most instances they can only be rightly attributed to the deplorable manner in which the book has been edited. The passage (vol. iv. p. 91) in which Sulaym is represented as conquering Mesopotamia and making the \u2018Okaylis in A.H. 438, sixty years after his expulsion against the Carmathians, and as being eventually killed and imprisoned by Na\u1e63ir ed Daulah ibn Marwan, is likely to be an error of the author, and is more probably the interpolation of some careless reader. It is no doubt based upon a misconception of somewhat similar events recorded by Ibn al Ath\u012br, obviously quite unconnected with the history of Bahrayn, although the Taghlibite al A\u1e25mad\u012b in question, may possibly have been a member of the tribe founded by the conqueror of the Carmathians.\u00b9\n\nM. Tiesenhausen, in the first note to his work, quotes a passage from Al Jann\u0101bi (who died in A.H. 999), quoting that writer from the Ma\u2018\u0101rif al Muta-akhirah of Ibn al \u1e24\u0101d\u012b, reciting the expulsion of the \u2018Okaylis by Sulaym and Banu \u2018Okayl from Bahrayn by the T\u0101\u2019if, followed by the return of the \u2018Okaylis after their overthrow by the Seljuks, their conquest of Bahrayn and Yam\u0101n, and the endurance of their dominion until after A.H. 627. This passage is somewhat briefer than the corresponding\n\n\u00b9 See Ibn al Ath\u012br, vol. ix. p. 369.\nIbn Khald\u016bn. It not only, however, adds nothing to the information contained in the latter wording of Al Jann\u0101bi\u2019s extract, apart from its being condensed, is identically the same. Ibn Khald\u016bn possibly have derived his information from Al Jann\u0101bi or both may have drawn from a common source. Hamad\u0101ni died in A.H. 521, and Ibn Khald\u016bn tells us that the reference to the date 651 was in writings of Ibn Sa\u02bfid. It seems more probable, that Al Jann\u0101bi\u2019s passage was copied, not from Al Jann\u0101bi but from Ibn Khald\u016bn.\nThe Tribes of '\u0100mir ibn \u1e62a'\u1e63a'ah\n(according to Ibn Khald\u016bn).\n\n'\u0100mir ibn \u1e62a'\u1e63a'ah\n\nNumayr | Rabi'ah | Hil\u0101l | Suw\u0101t\n-------|--------|------|------\n\n'\u0100mir ibn Rabi'ah\n\nKil\u0101b | Ka'b\n-----|------\n\nMu'awiyah | Rabi'ah | F\u0101ris | Har\u012bsh | 'Okayl | Kushayr | Ja'dah\n---------|--------|------|-------|------|------|------\n\nDhu's al Bakka | Sahmayn\n-------------|--------\n\n1 Kushayr and Ja'dah were the sons of the same mother, a daughter tribe of Sulaym (son of Man-sur, son of Kha\u1e63afah, son of Kays 'Ayl\u0101n).\n2 See for the name Babi'ah al Bakka, Ibn Khallikan, vol. i. p. 54; p. 452.\n\n---\n\nThe Sub-Tribes of 'Okayl.\n\n'Okayl\n\n'\u0100mir | 'Ob\n-----|------\n\n'Auf | Muntasik | Khaf\u0101jah\n----|--------|------\n\nM\u0101lik | 'Auf | Mu'awiyah\n-----|----|------\n\n'Auf | Khul\u016bt\n----|------\n\n'\u0100mir\nART. XXIII.\u2014Foreign Words in the Hebrew Te Old Testament. By the Rev. Stanley Leathes,\n\n(Communicated by the Hon. Secretary R.A.S.)\n\nThe Hebrews came in contact principally with two nations of antiquity, the Egyptians and the Persians; it is with them mainly, if not solely, that their literature preserved any traces of connection: and these traces chiefly to be found in the books of Moses and in those of Daniel, Ezra and Esther. As the Persian rule of did not begin till 536 B.C., one would suppose that records of the earlier reigns of Nebuchadnezzar a shazzar would not supply us with any words of derivation or connection, and this is undoubtedly ad as it is for many of the words we meet with in these that such derivation has been suggested, or any su nction supposed. There can be no doubt that number of Semitic roots were once in use, of w trace survives in the Old Testament, and therefo quite possible that, if we had a knowledge of the many difficult words would at once be explained as clear to us. One would expect, moreover, that tl in the parts of Daniel belonging or at all events r to the Assyrian period would have an Assyrian an fore a Semitic character, as indeed such names as Ne nezzar and Belshazzar show that they have; or, if affected at all by Accadian contact, it would that of which we should expect to find traces ratl t Persian influence. I am too profoundly igno t uncertain on the subject of Accadian discovery to i use of this myself or to feel any confidence in it wh It seems to me that our best security is to be fou\nattitude of watchful and patient waiting rather than in precipitate eagerness to clutch at results. The case is different with regard to words of Egyptian origin. The progress of Egyptian discovery has been much more prolonged and thorough. It is nearly a hundred years since the first steps were taken towards the decipherment of the hieroglyphics, and successive scholars have pushed their discoveries farther and further, till a position of comparative certainty has been attained. Much of course still remains to be done, but it is at least an indication of superior advancement that the confidence of those who are not experts, but are not devoid of learning, nor incapable of forming an opinion, is given with more ungrudging alacrity to the Egyptologist than to the Assyriologist. The science of the one has survived its nonage, but that of the other may be said to be still in its infancy. At all events that is my feeling, and I am not alone in my conviction. It must be borne in mind, however, that this is an expression of opinion, and not advanced as a statement of fact.\n\nThe progress of Egyptian discovery has thrown a flood of light upon the records of the Bible. If the Pentateuch is in any degree an authentic work, it was almost certain to contain numerous references to Egyptian customs and traces of the language of Egypt. That it has been proved conclusively to do so is a very solid argument for its being the genuine work it pretends to be; indeed so clear and so numerous are the points of contact it presents with the actual Egypt of history and the monuments, that we have to be on our guard against being tempted to multiply these instances to an unwarrantable degree. The indications of connection are so many that we must beware of imagining them where they do not exist. Here also discretion is the better part of that valour which will ultimately lead to victory.\n\nThere is not seldom a danger of accidental similarity being mistaken for direct relationship. It is not all the members of the same family that are alike, and it is not every two persons that strongly resemble one another, who are members\nof the same family because they are alike. The science of comparative philology has made enormous strides, and most substantial results have been secured; but probably be a long time yet before its greatest triumphs be achieved, the establishment, for example, upon a foundation\u2014a triumph, however, which is by no means probable, and which I for one should be prepared to entertain of the relation between the Semitic and the Aryan branch of language.\n\nThe first familiar foreign word which strikes us in the Bible is the title or appellation common to the Egyptian kings, viz. Pharaoh. It was formerly usual, after Joseph, to identify this word with the Coptic \u03c9\u03c1\u03bf \u2018king,\u2019 though \u03a6 or \u03a6 being prefixed. This etymology, however, seems to bring us very near to the Biblical \u05e4\u05b8\u05e8\u05b8\u05e2. At one time it was thought that the true equivalent might be found in the Egyptian word \u03c1\u03b1 \u2018the sun,\u2019 also with the article prefixed. It seemed fatal, however, to this suggestion that the word \u03c1\u03b1 was mostly found at the end of the name and without the article prefixed. The king, moreover, was called \u03c1\u03b1\u03b9 \u2018the son of Ra,\u2019 and this fact made it seem that he should also be called the Ra. The derivation for which I believe is received with more general approval now is that Pharaoh means \u201cthe house\u201d or \u201cthe great house,\u201d very much as we still speak of the Sublime House. It seems to be essential that we give due heed to the Shewa under the Resh in Pharaoh, and divide it accordingly Phar-ahoh, not Pha-raoh. For myself I confess that though this proposed derivation is better than either of the others, it fails to give me satisfaction, and though willing to accept it provisionally, I should nevertheless like to have some clearer and more obvious representative of the Hebrew Pharaoh than \u201cthe house\u201d or \u201cthe great house\u201d seems to suggest. One might have thought that a title so common as that of Pharaoh in the Biblical records would have been equally common on the monuments, and that the identity of the two words\na matter of certainty. The fact, however, that these various derivations have been proposed seems to show plainly that this is not the case. It of course follows that if Phar-ach means \"the great house,\" then another well-known name, that of Potiphar, will mean \"he who is devoted to the house,\" or \"the servant of the house,\" and so, like Pharaoh itself, be a title, and not an appellation. In close connection with this name comes another, which has often been confounded with it, viz. that of Potipherah, the priest of On or Heliopolis. Here it would appear that we may with more certainty detect the presence of the Egyptian p&., and then in that case Potipherah will mean \"he who is devoted to the sun,\" or \"the servant of the sun,\" an appellation obviously appropriate to the priest of the temple of the sun at On.\n\nThe word abrek, Gen. xli. 43, is rendered in the Authorised Version \"Bow the knee,\" with a margin \"or tender father,\" and in the Revised Version the same rendering is retained in the text, with a margin \"Probably an Egyptian word, similar in sound to the Hebrew word meaning to kneel.\" The version of the LXX. omits the word altogether, and has simply \"a herald proclaimed before him.\" The Syriac has \"Father and ruler.\" We see then that some translators have regarded this word as a significant Hebrew word, to be explained by the analogy of the language, while others have regarded it as a foreign word, and sought its meaning in the native languages of Egypt. There are only two ways in which it can be explained in Hebrew, which are severally represented in the text and margin of the A.V. The first of these is the explanation of Aben Ezra, who regards the \u05e0 as put for the \u05d4, just as in Jer. xxv. 3 we find \u05e0\u05b4\u05e6\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05e0 instead of \u05e0\u05b4\u05e6\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4; the other is that of Rashi, who quotes the Talmud, saying that Joseph was a father in wisdom, but tender in years. In the former case Abrech must be an imperative Hiphil wrongly spelt; we should moreover expect the plural rather than the singular in the proclamation of the herald to the people; in the other case the noun and adjective must either form a sort of compound, very unusual\nin Hebrew, or must be wrongly joined together. can be little doubt that we have here the actual v the country used in the proclamation, and consequer meaning must be sought in the vernacular language country. In Coptic a compound word may be forme \u0391\u03a0\u0395 'the head,' and \u03a1\u0395\u039a 'to bow,' which approxin sound to the Hebrew, but I believe it is not found in use. In the Coptic version of St. John's Gospel we have \u0391\u03a1\u0395\u039a\u03a7\u03a9\u03a8 'he bowed his head,' stooped but this does not give us the compound required, \u0391\u0393 is merely a pronominal particle used with verl therefore after all it seems that this use of the word jectural, and that no example is forthcoming of any word in form like that which we suppose Abrecl have approximately represented. The \"new expla mentioned by Mr. Cheyne, whom Delitzsch quotes' prolegomena to his new W\u00f6rterbuch, declared by the to be plausible, and apparently accepted by the latter, that Abrech comes direct from the Assyrian \u03b1\u03bd 'grand vizier,' can hardly be entertained with any of probability, and affords an instance of the nee is for speculative caution in these matters. The Pharaoh travelling to Assyria to find a title whi herald was to proclaim before Joseph, and which it presumed the people would understand, comes barely the confines of common sense. The word is unquestion Egyptian word; but what its real equivalent was in mental or spoken Egyptian is more than we are to discover or determine, humiliating as the con be to our philological knowledge or ingenuity. The n note of the Revised Version is probably as accurate near as we can get to the truth, and the supposed E word not improbably meant \"to bow the head or For the rest we can only exclaim with Luther, \"was heisse lassen wir die Zancher suchen bisz an den j\u00fcngste\n\nIn the same connection we have the name that I\n\n1 p. 145, n. 2.\ngave Joseph, Zaphnath-Paaneah, which is undoubtedly Egyptian. Of this Aben Ezra says quaintly, \"If this word is Egyptian, we do not know what it means,\" and Rashi says, \"There is no word like Paaneah in Scripture.\" We have here then without doubt an attempt to represent a genuine Egyptian word in Hebrew letters. The question is what the word or words can be. \u039a\u039f\u03a4\u03a4, \u039a\u03a9\u03a4\u03a4\u0395 are Coptic words, meaning 'redemption,' and \u0395\u03a4\u0395\u03a1 is 'the age,' \u1f00\u03bb\u03ad\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2. The two together then may mean, 'The redemption of the age' or, as applied to a person, 'the Saviour of his time or age,' that is, nearly equivalent to 'redeemer' or 'Saviour of the world.' The old notion that it meant revealer of secrets is a mere guess framed on the supposition that it was in some way of Hebrew origin, an idea which is highly improbable. There is another word \u039a\u03a9\u039d\u03a4\u03a4 'creation,' which, combined with \u0391\u039d\u0398\u03a1 'to live,' may possibly mean \"creator or possessor of life.\" But to discover the particular Egyptian words which lie hid in the Hebrew disguise requires a far wider knowledge of Egyptian than I can lay claim to, as well as the special gifts of a veritable revealer of secrets.\n\nVarious derivations have been preferred for the name Moses such as \u0391\u039c\u03a9\u03a1 \u039a\u0395 'son of the water,' \u0391\u039b\u0395\u039a 'natus,' \u0391\u039c\u03a9\u03a1 \u039f\u03a4\u0391\u039b\u0399 'delivered from the water,' \u0391\u039c\u03a9\u03a1 \u039f\u03a4\u0399 'taken out of the water,' and the like. I confess, however, that I have never seen clearly why the word should be other than Hebrew, as the narrative certainly seems to suggest: \"And she called his name Moses and said for from the water I drew him, \u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8.\" In Psalm xviii., and the duplicate version of it in Samuel, the same word is found used in the Hiphil, with very probable reference to this narrative. We have no reason then to doubt that the word is a genuine Semitic root, and it does not seem unnatural that Pharaoh's daughter should give the Hebrew child a Hebrew name, and that the name should be one suggested by her own saving act, and so she called him not 'one drawn out or saved,' as we might expect, which would be \u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8, but \u05de\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05d7 'a saviour or deliverer,' for she said \"I saved him from the water.\" In\nthis case it is needless to seek further for any Egyptian as a derivation, and every suggestion must be more or less unsatisfactory and uncertain. It is evident that in cases the names of the Old Testament heroes were consciously prophetic, and it might well be so with that great lawgiver and deliverer of the Hebrew nation.\n\nThe name of Joseph's wife, Asenath, is interpreted to 'a votary of Neith,' the prototype of Athene the god of wisdom, 'She who has been given to her.'\n\nThe word Pi-ahiroth is probably \u03c0\u03b9' \u1f08\u03be\u03af\u03c1\u03b9 \u03c1\u03c9\u03c4, the where the \u1f08\u03be\u03af\u03c1\u03b9 or \u1f08\u03be\u03af\u03c1\u03b9 grows; but Canon Cook mentions 'The house of wells, the watering-place in the desert.' Gen. xl. 16 we have mention made of three \u1f08\u03be\u03af\u03c1\u03b9 \u1f21\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03bd, referred in the A.V. 'white baskets.' I understand that the \u1f08\u03be\u03af\u03c1\u03b9 hauri has survived to this day in Cairo, and makes the leather covering of the bread basket. This word may probably represent the old Egyptian word answering \u1f08\u03be\u03af\u03c1\u03b9, but even here I do not feel by any means sure that the resemblance is not accidental, and the word itself \u1f08\u03be\u03af\u03c1\u03b9. The word \u1f08\u03be\u03af\u03c1\u03b9 occurs fourteen times in the Pentateuch elsewhere only in Judges vi. 19, and is Semitic. Hebrew \u1f08\u03be\u03af\u03c1\u03b9 is doubtless the Coptic \u1f08\u03be\u03af\u03c1\u03b9 'juncus,' only found Ex. ii. 3, Job viii. 11, Is. xviii. 2, speaking Ethiopia, and xxxv.7, where it is rendered 'reeds and rushes.'\n\nonly found in Gen., where it is used twenty-eight times of the ark of Noah and in Exodus twice of that of Jethro. It appears to represent the Coptic \u1f08\u03be\u03af\u03c1\u03b9.\n\nonly occurs three times Gen. xi. 3 'slime had been used for mortar;' xiv. 10 'The vale of Siddim was pits of slime,' and Ex. ii. 3 'daubed it with slime.' The Coptic equivalent is \u1f08\u03be\u03af\u03c1\u03b9, used of the ark of Noah, Gen. vi. 14 and xi. 5, where the Heb. is \u1f08\u03be\u03af\u03c1\u03b9.\n\nmay at all events be compared with \u1f08\u03be\u03af\u03c1\u03b9 which is used in the same way and means the same thing.\n\nIf M. Naville's identification of Pi ke heret holds good, neither accepted.\nIt is absurd, however, to suppose that one is borrowed from the other. The name of Moses' son Gershom has been connected with \u03b3\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd 'alienus,' but it seems more natural to find its origin in Heb. and regard it as a vocalised variation of \u05d2\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5\u05dd, and so the Septuagint has \u03a0\u03b7\u03c1\u03c3\u03ac\u03bc.\n\n\u1f21\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 'flax,' is one of those words which appear in the Pentateuch, Exodus ix. 31, and again in Isaiah xlii. 3, xliii. 17, but not elsewhere. It is interesting to note the occurrence of some of these words at those periods of the national history when there was special intercourse with Egypt. The equivalent for Goshen in Coptic is \u03ba\u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5. According to Canon Cook, each of three nomes in the Delta bore a name of which the first syllable was \u03ba\u03b1 'a bull,' and he says, moreover, on the authority of Brugsch, that the name of the twelfth nome in Lower Egypt was \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03c7\u03b5.\n\nPathom or Pithom is that which belongs to Thum. Pathros is probably \u03c0\u03b1-\u03b5\u03c4-\u03c0\u03b1\u03ba 'that which is towards the south.'\n\nRameses is of course connected with \u03c1\u03b1 'the sun,' and \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 'genitus, procreatus.' Succoth appears to have been identified by M. Naville with the name Thuku or Thuket found by him at Maskhutah. Pibeseth like Pithom is that which belongs to Beseth or Bubastis. A great many Hebrew words are given in the excursus of the Speaker's Commentary as being virtually Egyptian words. It seems to me that these must be received with great caution and a certain amount of reserve. It by no means follows, because there is an apparent similarity between two words in Egyptian and Hebrew, that they are the same word, or that the likeness is anything more than accidental; and even if we cannot discover the root of a Hebrew word in Hebrew, it does not follow that its root is to be found in Egyptian. It seems to me also that the principles of transliteration between Hebrew and Egyptian are too uncertain to be any sure guide to us, and that this is the case is proved by the variety of derivations and equivalents that have been proposed for the more common proper names, such as Pharaoh, Moses, and the like. To be quite sure that we have found\nthe true equivalent of a Hebrew word in Egyptian moreover, a far greater knowledge of the latter than I can pretend to possess, and not only a know its vocabulary, but a knowledge also of its laws of tion, composition, grammatical usage and the like take the proper names that are certainly Egyptian Pharaoh, Potiphar, Zaphnath-Paaneah, and the find that scholars are by no means unanimous as meaning, and I for one am ready to confess that the list in the Speaker's Commentary is too long ra too short. There are a few other words, such as \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd, and the like, which we may feel pretty Egyptian; but as for the rest of the list, I myself doubtful indeed about them. For instance, it see absurd to seek for an Egyptian origin for such a \u05d1\u05b9\u05bc\u05d0 \u05de\u05b4\u05e6\u05b0\u05e8\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd, the words used of Pharaoh's taskmaste i. 11. Each of the component elements is un Hebrew: why not therefore the combination? 'He over the tribute' is a phrase with which we are fa 2 Sam. xx. 24, 1 Kings iv. 6, and elsewhere, and hardly needs much explanation from sources.\n\noccurs only in Ex. ii. 3 and Is. xxxiv. 9 bis. refers it to a root \u05d9\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05da\u05b0 'to flow,' and compares t \u05d5\u05b0\u05e0\u05b8\u05ea\u05b7\u05df 'fluxit,' so that there seems no sufficient search for it elsewhere.\n\nEx. vii. 11 'with their enchantments,' the plural of the word used in Gen. iii. 24 of the sword at Paradise.\n\nGesenius regards as compounded of \u05d9\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05da\u05b0 'came forth,' and \u05e8\u05b6\u05d2\u05b6\u05e2 'a marsh,' as if leaping in forth from the marsh. The Arabic retains the rejecting the \u05d9\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05da\u05b0. With regard to the ot claimed as Egyptian, e.g., \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd, \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd, \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd, \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd, \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd, \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd, and a\nnamed in the Speaker's Commentary, I see no reason to believe that they are other than genuinely Semitic words.\n\nI come now to the Persian and Aryan words in Daniel, Esther and Ezra, and the first is naturally Cyrus. In the Avesta Cyrus is Hu\u015brava. Rawlinson says the name is now generally connected with the Kuru family of Ancient India, Speaker's Commentary, 3, 422. The ancient authorities distinctly tell us that the name was equivalent to the sun, and that the Persians called the sun K\u00fbpos or Ko\u00fbpos. In modern Persian \u062e\u0648\u0631 is undeniably the sun, cf. Sansk. \u0916\u0941\u0930 'a hero.' The Sanskrit writes the word for 'sun' with a dental \u0916. \u062e\u0648\u0631\u0634\u06cc\u062f = sunlight. Fuerst says the final \u062f is the nominative of the Persian, but the modern Persian has no nominative termination. Darius in like manner is doubtless connected with \u062f\u0627\u0631, meaning 'Lord, Master,' etc. with a like termination. The word also means 'house, palace,' etc. Cf. the word Pharaoh and its supposed meaning.\n\nArioch means a great lion, as Nisroch means a great eagle and the like. Abednego probably = Abed Nebo just as \u1f08\u03b2\u03b5\u03b4\u03bd\u03ad\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, \u1f08\u03b2\u03b5\u03b4\u03bd\u03ad\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 = \u03b3\u03bb\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, etc.\n\nMeshach is referred by Gesenius to \u0645\u06cc\u0632\u0634\u0627\u062f 'the guest or friend of the king.' According to Fuerst it is from \u0645\u06cc\u0634 the Sanskrit \u092e\u093f\u0937 'a ram,' and hence the sun-god. Max M\u00fcller says, \"Meshach may have been mes 'friend,' and shah 'king,' but in Persian this compound could only mean 'king of the friend';\" but with all due deference, mes-i-shah in Modern Persian would unquestionably mean 'friend of the king.' But the similar termination in Shadrach leads us to seek some common element. Fuerst regards Shadrach as the same as Hadrach Zech. ix. 1, and thinks it means the circular path of the sun, thence the name of the sun-god.\u00b9\n\nAhasuerus probably exhibits a terminal formation similar to that in Cyrus, Darius, etc. It is the Greek Xerxes, the Sanskrit \u0916 being represented by \u03be in Greek and by\n\n\u00b9 This is rendered the more probable from the fact of the LXX. having \u03a7\u03b5\u03c1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c7 in both places.\nin Hebrew, with a prosthetic and epenthetic which the Hebrews were obliged to adopt to express sound at the commencement of a syllable. In like manner is the Hebrew equivalent for Artaxerxes; the first syllable survives in \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631, but its actual derivation is not so easy to determine. Hesychius says \u1f08\u03c1\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u1f70 \u03a0\u03ad\u03c1\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2, but what is the word? \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631 Dan. iii. 2, vi. 2, Esth. i. 1, on the same principle represent an initial \u0627\u0631, and is probably the Greek \u03a3\u03b1\u03c1, which is apparently connected with \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631 \u2018the keeper of the host or army.\u2019 It has no equivalent in modern Persian.\n\nIn the same way \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631, \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631, \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631 no longer represent the modern Persian \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631 \u2018a camel.\u2019 This word probably took the place of \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631 in the older Persian. \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631 \u2018diligently,\u2019 is found in Ezra vii. 23. It is in all probability connected with the modern Persian \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631 \u2018rightly, gently,\u2019 or \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631 \u2018in the right, rightly.\u2019 \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631 are probably Semitic in both elements, the first according to Fuerst, being the astrologers of the god of Adar.\n\n\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631 or \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631 is the same word as Daric, hence derived, which seems to be very uncertain. The derivation is from \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631 and \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631 \u2018the king\u2019s image;\u2019 Fuerst.\n\n\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631 equals Ecbatana, the m becoming b.\n\n\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631 Ezra v. 8, etc., we may compare with the Persian \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631 \u2018complete,\u2019 and on the authority of Fuerst as quoted by Fuerst, the old Persian as-parna, i.e. \u2018completely, quite,\u2019 parna being the pass part. of p\u0113r\u0113 \u2018to complete.\u2019\n\n\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631 Ezra iv. 13, \u2018endamage the revenue of the king\u2019 is a very uncertain word; the LXX. render it \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf which the Syriac \u2018and so it is\u2019 nearly corresponds.\n\nMithredath, the name of a treasurer under Cyrus i. 8, is obviously compounded of Mithra, the nat...\nmediator between Ormuzd and Ahriman, connected probably with the Persian \u2018the sun, a friend,\u2019 etc., and Persian \u2018the sun, love,\u2019 etc. The last syllable would seem to be connected with the Persian \u2018to give.\u2019\n\nEzra iv. 7, \u2018a letter,\u2019 seems to come from or be connected with the Persian \u2018to write.\u2019 Fuerst regards the as a noun-ending, but the modern language has no such form.\n\nPithgam Esther i. 20, \u2018decree,\u2019 is perhaps the modern Persian \u2018message or embassy.\u2019 What the old form was I do not know.\n\n\u2018food, fare,\u2019 is supposed to be connected with the Sanskrit ; in Persian, is \u2018toll, tribute.\u2019 If this is really the derivation of the word, it is a curious instance of foreign influence so early in Babylon.\n\nand Ezra vii. 11, Esth. iii. 14, \u2018copy.\u2019 The first element is probably the same as before, but what is the second? Esth. i. 3, etc., is probably connected with the Sanskrit \u2018first.\u2019\n\nperhaps connected with the Persian \u2018fear,\u2019 and \u2018to fear.\u2019 Gesenius compares \u2018Gestrenger Herr.\u2019 is interpreted by , but the modern Persian for \u2018part, portion, fragment\u2019 is , with which there is probably some connection.\n\nThe word is common both to the Egyptian and Chaldaean parts of the Bible, which is so far a reason for not seeking its origin in Coptic. Otherwise Gesenius compares from ep fucere and \u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03c2 and spectuus custos secretorum. I would rather believe with Fuerst that it is a derivative of stylus. In like manner we have \u2018an axe.\u2019 Some have compared .\n\nAccording to Gesenius and Fuerst, Belshazzar and Belteshazzar are only variations of the same name, and mean the Prince of Bel or the favourite of Bel, the sh or tsh being the\nFOREIGN WORDS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT.\n\nZend genitive. Fuerst admits that the name has not been satisfactorily explained, and certainly the attempt to weld together a Chaldaean proper name and a Sanskrit termination by means of an Aryan genitive case does not look promising. The names moreover are distinct, and not improbably mean respectively 'Bel the prince' and 'Beltis defends the prince.'\n\nThe word \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9 is thought to be connected with \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9 Pasha, but Pasha is supposed to be corrupted from Pad and if so can have nothing to do with \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9 'wing.' Fuerst compares \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9 ('dignity, rank, officer, employ' Johnson) and translates it 'under-governor.' Max M\u00fcller asks by way of suggestion whether the \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9 termination in the Chaldee can be meant for \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9, Pusey, Daniel, p. 57; in that case the \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9 may represent the pad or \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9, but the etymology and derivation of this word is mysterious.\n\n\u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9 Dan. iii. 2, 3, 'the treasurers,' apparently the same as \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9 Ezra vii. 21, cf. \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9 i. 8. Of the last words the first is taken as the plural of the second, and the word in Daniel as a variation of the same. In the etymology must be sought in the singular form of the \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9 and then treasure-bearer \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9 'treasurer' and \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9 'keeper,' may perhaps be the modern equivalents. But their appearance in Daniel has to be accounted for. I manner \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9 'counsellors,' Dan. iii. 2, 3=law-beare at all events, that is the etymology proposed by so high authority as Max M\u00fcller. It seems strange, however, that the long vowel in \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9 and \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9 should be represented by sheva in Hebrew.\n\n\u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9 occurs Daniel iii. 2, 3. The proposed reference to the Sanskrit \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9 is preposterous, as the name Mufti still survives from the same Semitic root=\u2018a man learned in the law.\u2019\n\nThe word \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05b7\u05d9 Dan. i. 11, 16, evidently\nofficer; as to its derivation I feel very uncertain. The proposed \u092e\u0927\u0941 and \u0936\u093f\u0930\u0938\u094d (\u092e\u0927\u0941 is properly \u2018sweet,\u2019 \u03bc\u03ad\u03b8\u03c5, \u092e\u0947\u0920 is \u2018head\u2019 in Persian) is highly unsatisfactory, and why should we seek for Aryan etymologies at a time prior to the Persian rule?\n\nDan. ii. 6, v. 17, \u2018rewards,\u2019 may well be referred to the Semitic root \u05d9\u05b8\u05e8 in the sense of \u2018spoils, gains,\u2019 far more naturally than to \u092e\u0927\u0941 or \u092e\u093e\u0928.\n\nonly in the plural seems to be referable to the Arabic root \u0634\u062d\u0646, which in the second conjugation means \u2018appointed a deputy.\u2019 In the first conjugation it means \u2018filled.\u2019 Cf. the Hebrew phrase of filling the hand, that is, consecrating the priest. The Arabic usage may indeed be derived from this word, in which case we have carte blanche for the derivation of its etymology.\n\nDan. iii. 21, 27. This has been identified by metathesis with the Persian \u0634\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0631 or \u0634\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0631 \u2018breeches or drawers.\u2019 The Arabic is \u0633\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0644, plural \u0633\u0631\u0627\u064a\u06cc\u0644, and the etymology has been sought in \u0936\u093f\u0930 and \u091a\u0942, truly a curious etymology for breeches \u2018a covering of the head.\u2019\n\nDan. vi. 3 \u2018presidents.\u2019 This is very possibly connected with Sargon and \u0938\u093e\u0930, and I would certainly rather refer it to \u0936\u0930\u094d\u0915 \u2018socius fuit\u2019 with Fuerst, than attempt to connect it with \u0936\u093f\u0930 v. Gesenius, which for many reasons I should regard as impossible.\n\nDan. v. 7, 16, 29, evidently \u2018a chain.\u2019 This is referred to the Sanskrit \u092e\u0923\u093f, but then what about the \u0939? All the commentators and the Dictionaries assume the connexion with \u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2, monile, and the like, but it seems to me that the presence of the initial \u0939 when it is not wanted is not so easily disposed of.\n\n\u2018cotton,\u2019 Esther i. 6, is undoubtedly the Sanskrit \u0915\u0930\u094d\u092a\u0938\u094d, the Greek \u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 and Latin carbasus.\n\nis obviously connected with \u2018surrounded,\u2019 what-\never similarity or relation there may be with \u03ba\u1fc6\u03bb\u03b5\n\u03ba\u03af\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2.\n\n'\u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 'a peacock' is probably the Sanskrit \u0905\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093f\u0915 'a\none or peacock.' This word in Tamil becomes togei.\n\n'\u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 'apes' is supposed to be the Sanskrit \u0905\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093f,\nBopp derives from \u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e 'to move about.' If the m is\nlost, this may account for the long vowel of the Hebre\n\nis in all probability 'tooth of the ibha,' 'elephant,' \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9, a word which appears again in \u05dc\u05b5\u05d1\u05b6\u05df\nelephant,' and in an Egyptian form quoted by G\n\u03b5\u03b2\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4.

It is manifestly one th\ntrace a connection between words of this kind in lan\nnot allied, and quite another to say that in the particu\none has been borrowed from the other.\n\nis a word found in Eccles. ii. 5, Song of Songs\nand Nehemiah ii. 8. It is obviously the Greek \u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\nbut the origin of the word is very uncertain. It\nfrequently connected with the Sanskrit \u092a\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0924\u0903, but\nproperly means 'a foreign country,' though Fuerst\nas 'a region of surpassing beauty.' Two other wo\nproposed, the Armenian pardes 'a garden surroun\nhouse,' and the Zend pairidaeza 'an inclosure.' T\nrelation of these several forms is doubtful, though\nprobably connected.\nI do not pretend to have made a complete or exhaustive list of foreign words occurring in the Old Testament. I have contented myself rather with the more obvious and familiar ones. Every man who has a special taste for Egyptian or Assyrian investigation will easily imagine he detects Egyptian or Assyrian or Accadian words in Hebrew. The tendency is one which needs to be jealously and carefully watched, and does not want stimulating, as we are very apt to be misled by the fascination of our own imaginary discoveries, and there is nothing that is so absorbing as the fascination of a new discovery.\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\n(June, July, August.)\n\nI. REPORTS OF MEETINGS OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY,\n1885-86.\n\nSeventh Meeting, 21st June, 1886.\u2014E. L. Brandreth, the Chair.\n\nElections: Surgeon-General W. R. Cornish, C.I.E.; John Baillie; and Mr. Jhangir K. R. Kama, as Resident Member; Mr. William Davies as non-Resident Member.\n\nThe following paper was read by the author: Early Symbolism, by Robert Sewell, Madras Civil Service, M.R.A.S. The object of the lecturer was to show the probability, those symbols found carved on early Buddhist monuments, which cannot be directly traced to indigenous sources, were derived from Western Asian symbols, and connected with Sun-worship. Summarising the pre-local history, he showed that for eight centuries Northern India was open to Assyrian and Chaldean influences, while for the succeeding two centuries a considerable portion of that country was under the Persian empire. Alluding to a probable trading in the goods of the inhabitants on either side the Indus, and giving Greek and Roman influence in India, he argued that the institutions and beliefs of the masses of the people, whether in Assyria, Chaldea or Persia, were very similar, and consequently the present identification of early Buddhist symbols as nothing improbable. Mr. Sewell then entered into detail, illustrated his argument by reference to particular cases of resemblance.\n\nOf the five heads into which this section was divided in the last Journal, four and five will for the present quarter, and until completion arrangements be merged in a general review, such as hitherto adopted Annual Report. A separate head is introduced for Obituary Notices.\nThe whole appears in the July number of the Journal.\n\nSir George Birdwood and M. Bertin spoke also on the subject. The remarks of the former, of which a written abstract was received, have been printed as an addendum to the paper.\n\nThis Meeting concluded the Session 1885-86. At its close the Society adjourned to November next. Monday, the 15th of that month, has been since fixed as the date for resuming the Proceedings.\n\nII.

F. T. Atkinson, Esq., B.A., C.S., the newly-appointed President, in the chair.\n\n\u00b9 Under this head are necessarily comprised the Reports received during the quarter, rather than the Proceedings of that particular quarter.\nSixteen presentations were announced; three candidates for proposed, and a letter was read from Mr. Percival accepting of Hon. General Secretary. A Government notification, c Revised Rules for the working of the Indian Treasure Trove read and recorded.\n\nThe Philological Secretary read a report on sixty old copies received from the Secretary to the Government N.W.

On 104 silver coins from the Deputy Commissioner of Central Provinces.\n4. On a gold coin from the Collector of Nuddea. This is affirmed to be one of N\u00e1ra Gupta, an ancient ruler of Bih\u00e1r and Bengal, and cannot be placed earlier than A.D. 400, if the end of the second century be accepted as the initial epoch of the rise of the earlier Gupta line.\n\n5.

With reference hereto, the President remarked that the best response would be to announce the matter in the Proceedings.\n\nTwo papers were read: 1. \"On some Snow Measurements at Kailung in Lahoul,\" by the Rev. A. W. Heyde; 2. \"On Three New Himalayan Primulas,\" by G. King, Esq., M.B., LL.D., F.L.S.\n\nThe President, entering into particulars of the work, paid a graceful tribute to the worth and ability of the late Mr. Edward Thomas, Treasurer of the Royal Asiatic Society. He was followed by Dr. Mitra, a personal friend of the deceased, who passed a high eulogium upon his services in the cause of numismatic research. Eulogising his private character and qualities, the learned doctor remarked that those \"who were best able to appreciate his merits held him in high esteem.\"\n\nThe subject for conversation in the Philological Society's Department was \"Manikhyala, and a gold ornament made of Roman coins recently found there.\"\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique, Paris, 4th May, 1886.\u2014M. Barbier de Meynard, Vice-President, in the chair.\n\nAfter the election of three new members, and ordinary business, M. Clermont-Ganneau stated to the Council particulars regarding certain Palmyrene inscriptions which had not been published.\n\nM. Oppert read the translation of a Babylonian inscription containing a marriage contract confirmed by a tribunal.\n\nM. Rubens David offered the suggestion that the two Aramaean words ard\u00edkla and aryoubla (signifying architect and mason respectively) have in their composition the word ard 'servant,' coupled in the one case with ek\u00e1l for ha\u00edkul (temple or palace), and in the other with galboul (artizan).\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\nThe Abb\u00e9 Quentin, who had returned from the study of inscriptions regarding the Deluge at the British Museum, gave that he would shortly submit to the Council the result of searches.\n\nSociety of Biblical Archaeology, London, 1st June, 1886.\u2014Morrison, Esq., President, in the chair.\n\nAfter the ordinary routine of proceedings, Mr. F. G. Price, F.S.A., read a paper describing a number of Egyptian Antiquities in his Collection. Those on which the greater stress was laid were from Ekhmim, the site of the ancient Chemmis, on the right bank of the Nile opposite to Suh\u00e1g, where some very interesting excavations had been made in 1885. Two sepulchral boxes of wood, with remarkable drawings and decorations; the pedestal figure of Ptah-Socaris-Osiris; the lid or cover of a funerary sycamore wood, bearing the inscription, \"Ta poer, the wife of P.\" (as read by M. Rovillout), and some masks from mummy cases among the articles described.\n\nThe following communications to the Society are on the record:\n\nTwo from M. P. Le Page Renouf on the name of the blind god and the Egyptian God Apriat; one from Professor Sayce on inscriptions at Abydos and elsewhere; one from the Rev. J. C. Ball on the name of David; and a second from Professor Sayce on \"Coptic and Christian Inscriptions in Upper Egypt.\" Besides these, Dr. Hannes, \"the monastery of Father John,\" with its cemeteries and surroundings, has supplied the material of a most interesting study.\n\nAmerican Oriental Society, 12th May, 1886.\u2014Professor W. D. Whitney, in the chair.\n\nAfter the usual routine of Proceedings, reports were given from Mr. Rockhill, in Peking. He had sent some rubbing of pillar inscriptions from Pan Shan, east of the capital. They are from the Ming Dynasty (A.D. 1368-1644), and many of the characters are Nagari Sanskrit. Sixteen Roman coins also had been found in Peking, some of which antedated from Nero.\n\nThe following is a list of the papers read, or accepted for reading:\n\n1. On Hebrew Military History in the Light of Modern Science; by General Henry Carrington, U.S. Army.\n2. On a Greek Hagiologic MS. in the Philadelphia Library; by Professor J. Hall, of New York City.

Spieker, of Baltimore.\n\nIn addition to the above, spoken addresses were given by the Rev. T. P. Hughes and the Rev. John Chandler; and the Rev. W. H. Ward exhibited photographs of Hittite Sculpture from 'Ain Tab.\n\nThe Society adjourned to meet at New Haven on 27th October.\n\nIII. Correspondence.\n\nPre-Akkadian Writing.\n\n62, Chesilton Road, Fulham Road, S.W.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am desirous of directing your attention to the fact, that I have advocated for several years the existence of the Chaldean or Babylonian writing anterior to the arrival of the Akkadians in the country. The successive transformations undergone by the writing, chiefly in its arrangement, and the fact that the Akkadian sounds were not the most important, had forced this conclusion upon my mind. I have published this in several places, notably in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, April, 1883, Vol. XV. p. 279, note 3.\n\nIn the last issue of the Journal (Vol. XVIII. Part III.) there is a paper on the Pre-Akkadian Semites, by Mr. G. Bertin, in which no allusion has been made to the priority of my discovery.\n\nI am, yours faithfully,\n\nThe Secretary Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nTerrien de Lacouperie.\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\nIV. OBITUARY NOTICES.\n\nThree losses to the Society by death have taken place in this quarter: two, Resident Members, one of many and one of standing, the other a distinguished scholar who had been one of Honorary Members for four years.\n\nJohn Hallett Batten, son of the Rev. Dr. Joseph Hallett, Principal of the East India College at Haileybury, and his wife, was born at Haileybury, in the county of Essex, on 5 May, 1811. He was educated at Charterhouse, and in 1827, received a nomination to the Bengal Civil Service under Edward Parry, a Director of the East India Company. Afterwards he entered Haileybury College, and passed out in 1829, having obtained a prize for an Essay, and marked as Distinguished. During his career at the College he was proficient in Classics, Law, Political Economy, and Persian, the other subjects which formed the curriculum of his studies.\n\nJohn Hallett Batten arrived in Bengal on 22 November, and in the following year proceeded to Europe on furlough. On his return to India he was appointed Assistant to the Commissioner of Revenue and Circuit in the Gorakhpur division, and later Assistant to the Magistrate and Collector at Azimgarh. He was transferred in 1834 to the Meerut division, under the Commissioner of Revenue and Circuit, in 1835 he became Assistant to the Magistrate and Collector at Saharanpur, exercising the powers of Magistrate and Deputy Collector at that station in 1836; shortly after he was transferred as Assistant to the Commissioner of Kumaon. In 1837 he was Acting Joint Magistrate and Deputy Collector at Garhwal; in 1839 Senior Assistant to Commissioner and in charge of the Revised Revenue Settlement at Kumaon. After his furlough to Europe, he returned to duty in 1858, and in 1860 was appointed Civil and Sessions Judge of Cawnpore. In 1861 he became Commissioner of the Agra division, but retired from active service in 1865, when he became an Annuitant on the Fund. He contributed papers to the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal and other Indian Societies. He died on July 14th, 1886, at Heavitree, after a very short illness, aged 75. An old and esteemed member of the Royal Asiatic Society, in the records of which his name appears in 1856, he had visited its rooms in Albemarle Street in seeming health and vigour only a few days prior to his death.\n\nThe name of Mr. Andrew Cassels, a much-respected...\nthe Royal Asiatic Society, is more especially connected with Eastern interests as that of a Member of the Indian Council. After many years spent on the Continent, chiefly in Italy, Mr. Cassels went out to Bombay as partner in the great Manchester firm, Messrs. John Peel & Co., and founded the house Peel, Cassels & Co., at the head of which he remained for a considerable period. On returning from India in 1851, he continued for some years in the business in Manchester, until his retirement, when he settled in London. He became one of the Directors of the Metropolitan Railway Company, and long acted as Chairman of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, a post which he only resigned on accepting the office of Member of the Council of India, offered to him in 1874 by Lord Salisbury. At the termination of the statutory term of tenure of this office in 1884, repeated efforts were made by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce and other bodies to secure his reappointment, but this was not considered expedient, as being the first vacancy after the introduction of the ten years' limit, although the value of his services was fully recognized. Mr. Cassels was an active member of the Society of Arts, in which he took great interest; he was one of their Committee appointed to aid the organization of the Great Exhibition of 1851, and was elected to their Council in 1872, and Vice-President in 1875. He died on the 2nd of August in his seventy-fifth year, and was buried in the Brompton Cemetery.\n\nProfessor B. J\u00fclg, a high authority on the Mongol-Kalmuk languages, with which he had been familiar from youth, died on the 14th August, aged 61, at Innspruck, in the University of which city he was Professor of Classical Philology. From his special connection with Tartar Fable Literature\u2014a field which cannot be said to be thoroughly occupied\u2014his loss will be felt outside his own immediate sphere of work. Only four years ago he was enrolled among the Honorary Members of this Society, a distinction accorded to his widely-spread reputation. His paper \"On the Present State of Mongolian Researches\" was published in Vol. XIV. pp. 42-65 of the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nV. EXCEPTA ORIENTALIA.\n\nNos. 3 and 4, vol. liv. part 1, of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, consist of two papers only, Mr. Growse's \"Notes on the Fatehpur District, N.W.P.,\" and part 2 of the \"Geography of India in the reign of Akbar,\" by Mr. Beames. No. 1 of the\nForty-fifth volume, part 1, besides a Numismatic notice, learned and well-reasoned article on the \"Antiquity and Genus of the Epic called the Prithi R\u00e1j R\u00e1s\u00e1,\" commonly ascribed \"Chand Bardai,\" from the pen of Kavi R\u00e1j Shy\u00e1mal M.R.A.S., Poet-Laureate, and Member of the State Council Mewar; some \"Notes on the Chittagong Dialect,\" by Mr. Pargiter, B.A.; and a second article of Mr. Shy\u00e1mal D\u00e1s, \"Birthday of the Emperor Jal\u00e1luddin Muhammad Akbar,\" quaintly, but not inconclusively, changes the generally recorded date of Akbar's birth from the 16th October to the 23rd November 1542. While the \"Poet-Laureate\" is shown to be contributing four-fifths of this whole number of the Journal, it is explained his original papers were in Hindi, and that Munshi R\u00e1m P\u00e1ni was responsible for the English translation.\n\nThe following new numbers of the Bibliotheca Indica have received:\n\nSanskrit.\u2014Par\u00e1sara Smr\u00edt\u00ed, by Pandit Chandrak\u00e1nta T\u0101nuk\u00e1ra, fasciculus v.\n\nThe Nirukta with Commentaries, edited by Pandit Saty\u00e1ram\u00e1ram\u00ed, vol. iii. fasc. iv.\n\nTattva Chint\u00e1mani, ed.

M. Muhammad Ilahd\u00e1d, vol. i. fasc. iv.\n\nJournal Asiatique, Huiti\u00e8me s\u00e9rie, tome vii. No. 2, Mars-1866, contains the following articles: L'Histoire de Gal Schim\u00e1s, by M. H. Zotenberg; Mat\u00e9riaux pour servir \u00e0 l'histoire de la Numismatique et de la M\u00e9trologie Musulmanes, by Sauvaine; La Br\u00edhatkath\u00e1ma\u00f1jar\u00ed de Kshemendra, continuation of the conclusion, by M. J. Sylvain-L\u00e9vi; and Tchao-sien-tch\u00e9h, a memoir on the Corea by a Corean (anonymous), translated into French first time from the Chinese, with commentary, by M. S.\n\nIn the \"Nouvelles et M\u00e9langes\" are a review of Prince Mu\u1e25ammad Salih's Uzbek poem of the Shaibaniad, translated into French by Professor Vamb\u00e9ry; a notice of the Imitatio Christi, as rendered from Latin into Chaldean, and other papers. No. 3 of the same volume, Mai-Juin, 1886, contains an article on S\u00e1lim, a Persian satirical poet who flourished at the close of the seventeenth century, by M. H. Fert\u00e9, dragoman of the French legation at Constantinople; a continuation of M. Sauvaine's magnificent history of Muhammadan Numismatics and Metrology; a translation by Professor M. C. de Harlez of the last book of the Gurun-i-Sudur\u00e9 Bithe, forming an appendix to the history of the Empire of Kiu, and written at the period of the Conquest by the Mandchus; and the second part of M. Sev\u00e9n's 4th\non the Inscriptions of Piyad\u00e1si. The contents of the \"Nouvelles et M\u00e9langes\" have been reported in the notice of Proceedings.\n\nGerman Oriental Society, vol. xi. part 2, contains: M. Klamroth, on the Extracts from Greek writers in Al-Yak\u00fab; M. Gr\u00fcnbaum, Observations on the Shem Hammaphorash as an Imitation of an Aramaic Expression, and on Linguistic Imitations in general; Spitta's Arabic Manuscripts; N. Karamianz, Twenty-one letters of a lost Alphabet; H. H. Dhruva, Sanskrit Grants and Inscriptions of Gujr\u00e1t Kings, Nos. vi. to ix.; Hermann Jacobi, On the knowledge of Asia; E. Hultszsch, Corrections and Additions to the Amr\u00e1vati Inscriptions; F. von Bradke, Contributions to the History of Religions and Languages of Ancient India; and Extracts from Dr. Snouck Hurgronje's letters in Leyden, to Dr. Goldziher in Budapest.\n\nArcheology.\u2014An account of the American Archeological Expedition to Mesopotamia forms the subject of an abstract of two lectures recently delivered by Dr. Hayes Ward of New York, quoted in the Academy, 12th June from the Johns Hopkins University Circulars. The Hittite Centres of Marash and Jarablus were the first points visited; afterwards Mosul, Baghdad, and other well-known modern towns in the vicinity of Biblical or historically-interesting sites. In the opinion of the lecturer there are still mounds, at or near Babylon, which ought to be carefully worked; and Warka, second only to Babylon in extent, promises exceptional fruitfulness in antiquities. We learn also from the Academy of the 3rd July, that Professor Tiele has republished from the Transactions of the Royal Academy of Holland, his paper on \"The principal Temples of Babylon and its Suburb Borsippa, according to the Inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar.\" In it he shows conclusively \"that the great temple of Bel Merodach called E-Sagila contained the Babylonian E-Zida or temple of Nebo, and was not separate from it... The original E-Zida was at Borsippa, and is now represented by the well-known ruins termed by the natives Birs-i-Nimrud, in whose vitrified bricks many scholars have seen the remains of the Tower of Babel.\"\n\nM. Dieulafoy's Excavations in Susiana are again noticed in the Academy of the 24th July. These had been lately directed to opening the foundations of a palace more ancient than that of Artaxerxes Mnemon, as also to fresh discoveries on the site of Apadana. Many objects of interest had been obtained and brought to the Louvre, the work having been stimulated by the Shah's abandonment of claims to half the collection, as stipulated under the terms of the original Farm\u00e1n.\n\nIn the Indian Antiquary for June we have \"Pride Abased,\" a Kashmiri Tale, which the Rev. J. Hinton Knowles had heard from a Br\u00e1hman named Mukund B\u00e1y\u00fb of Srinagar; the \"Last years of Shah Shuja'a, with an Appendix on the Affairs of Hirat,\" an interesting translation made by Mr. Rehatsch from the T\u00e1rikh Sult\u00e1n\u00ed of Sult\u00e1n Muhammad Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1r\u00e1kz\u00e1i: a short contribution to his Folk-Lore in Western India by Mr. Putlibai D. H. Wadia.\n\"Mudyanur Plates of Saka 261 of the Bana king Malladeva Nandivarman,\" by Lewis Rice, C.I.E.: a continuation of Mrs. Grierson's Gipsy Index; and \"Indragonim and other Grammarians,\" with the \"Chandra Vyakarana and Kasika-Vritta,\" two articles by Professor Kielhorn. An announcement by Mr. V. A. Smith that he is preparing a full analytical Index to Gen. Cunningham's Archaeological Reports, which will be published in a separate volume by the Government of India; and three contributions by Mr. Fleet, one, a note on the coins of the Hindu Kings of Kabul; one, the description of a new Grant of Dharasona II. of Valabhi, and one an extract from the Acharatika:\u2014these constitute the Miscellanea of the month. The July number is remarkable for Mr. Fleet's papers on the \"Epoch of the Gupta Era\" and \"Sanskrit and Old Canarese Inscriptions;\" succeeding which are Mr. Hultzsch's observations on a Gwalior Inscription of Vikrama Samvat 1161, and Professor Kielhorn's notes on the Mahabhashya. In the Miscellanea are reviews of Gen. Cunningham's Book of Indian Eras; Dr. Solf's \"Die Kasmir-Recension des Panca\u00e7ika; the Taprobanian, a Dravidian Journal of local research published in Ceylon; Prof. Robertson Smith's \"Kinship and Marriage in Early Arabia;\" and the History of Nepal, translated by Munshi Sheo Shankar Singh and Pandit Sri Gunanand, and edited by Daniel Wright, M.D.; Dr. Hughes' Dictionary of Islam; Mr. T. G. Scott's Burma; the English translation of the Mahabharata; and a reprint of Vol. I. Asiatic Researches. To the August number of the Indian Antiquary, Mr. Murray-Aynsloy contributes No. VI. of his \"Discursive Contributions towards the comparative study of Asiatic Symbolism,\" treating of Sacred Trees; Mr. Patlibai Wadia adds a new story to his illustrations of Folk-Lore in Western India; Mr. Fleet brings out the extreme importance of his sixth-century Mandasor Inscription of Yasodharman and Vishnuvardhana, supplying the text in Roman characters and a facsimile of the original; Professor Kielhorn continues his notes on the Mahabhashya; Sir Walter Elliot communicates a further notice of the Ancient Buddhist Structure at Negapatam; and Mrs. Grierson's Gipsy-Index is carried on to the word \"Red.\" Of the two letters headed \"Miscellanea,\" Mr. Fleet's will be noticed later on under \"Epigraphy\"; the other signed G. M. C. objects to a passage in the preface of Dr. Peterson's edition of the Subhashitavali of Vallabhadeva, on which no more need be said than that one of the two able Editors of the Indian Antiquary then on the spot, concurs in the objection. As to the book itself, Dr. B\u00fchler writes that Dr. Petersen \"has now given us, in conjunction with Pandit Durgaprasada of Jaipur, an edition which certainly will be most useful, nay indispensable to every Sanskritist, both for the critical restoration of many classical texts, and for the study of the history of classical poetry.\"\n\nOn June 22nd, 1865, was held the first public meeting for establishing the Palestine Exploration Fund,\u2014and on the same date thi\nyear the meeting to celebrate the twenty-first anniversary of that institution\u2014His Grace the Archbishop of York being the Chairman on both occasions. The work done has been succinctly described in a neat, illustrated volume published by the Committee. There are three objects shown to press urgently for accomplishment at the present time, i.e. the Recovery of the Second Wall of Jerusalem; an Inquiry into the manners and customs of the people residing in and about the Holy Land; and the publication of Capt. Conder's Survey of Eastern Palestine, Le Compte's drawings made for M. Clermont-Ganneau's Arch\u00e6ological Mission, Hart's Natural History Memoir, and Schumacher's Second Survey. It is to be hoped that Funds will not be wanting for so worthy a purpose. The Quarterly Statement for July contains brief but interesting papers by Professor Hayter Lewis, Capt. Conder, Mr. William Simpson, Mr. Weld, Professor Hull, the Rev. E. Flecker, the Rev. W. F. Birch, and M. Schick. Four of these are of a controversial character, but controversy is not only natural but desirable in questions of arch\u00e6ological identification. Mr. Simpson, writing on \"Stone doors,\" refers to one at Lasgird (or Lasjird) in Persia, which \"wrought on pivots the same as the doors of Bashan,\" and is the only entrance to the village within the circular wall. Much might be written on this remarkable place, of which some rough idea has been given by Dr. Bellew in his sketch at p. 404, \"From the Indus to the Tigris.\" The derivation of its name from the circle \"traced on the ground by Las or Last, the son of Noah,\" is one of those many local interpretations more readily supplied than logically supported throughout the length and breadth of the Shah's dominions. There is a review of Professor Hull's Survey of Western Palestine in the Athen\u00e6um of June 12.\n\nIn the Academy of August 7, Mr. James Burgess gives an account of his recent visit to Sri Sailam, or Sri Parvata, an old Hindu shrine dedicated to Mallikarjuna (a form of Siva) on the Nallamalla, or black mountains, about 80 miles lower down the Krishna river than Karnul. This is supposed to be built on the site of the Pigeon or Black Peak Monastery mentioned by Fa-Hian and Hiouen-Thsang in Southern India, \"founded for the Buddhists, and where N\u0101g\u0101rjuna died, but which was afterwards seized on by the Brahmins.\"\n\nSemitic Literature: Hebrew and Chaldee.\u2014We learn from the Academy of the 12th June that \"Outlines of Jewish History from the Babylonian Captivity to the Present Time,\" is the title of a work by Mrs. Philip Magnus, then nearly ready for publication.\n\nDuring the forthcoming season, at Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Haupt, Professor of Semitic, proposes to lecture on the Critical Interpretation of Selected Psalms, on Hebrew Exercises, and reading unpointed texts at sight, and on Biblical Aramaean Grammar and the Chaldee Poetry of Daniel.\n\nSyriac.\u2014The Athen\u00e6um of the 5th July adverts to Dr. Isaac H. Hall's reproductions of the Syrian Antilegomena Epistles from a MS. of 1471, brought to America from Mardin by the late Rev. William F. Williams, then a missionary at that place. The text, of\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\n\"Mudyanur Plates of Saka 261 of the Bana king Malladeva divarman,\" by Lewis Rice, C.I.E.: a continuation of Grierson's Gipsy Index: and \"Indragonim and other marians,\" with the \"Chandra Vyakarana and Kasika-Vritta articles by Professor Kielhorn. An announcement by A. Smith that he is preparing a full analytical Index to Cunningham's Archaeological Reports, which will be published in a separate volume by the Government of India; and contributions by Mr. Fleet, one, a note on the coins of Hindu Kings of Kabul; one, the description of a new inscription of Dharusena II. of Valabhi, and one an extract from Acharatika.\u2014these constitute the Miscellanea of the month July number is remarkable for Mr. Fleet's papers on the \"of the Gupta Era\" and \"Sanskrit and Old Canarese Inscription succeeding which are Mr. Hultzsch's observations on a G Inscription of Vikrama Samvat 1161, and Professor Kie notes on the Mahabhashya. In the Miscellanea are revised Gen. Cunningham's Book of Indian Eras; Dr. Solf's \"Die K Recension des Pancacika; the Taprobanian, a Dravidian J of local research published in Ceylon; Prof. Robertson's \"Kinship and Marriage in Early Arabia;\" and the I of Nepal, translated by Munshi Sheo Shankar Singh and Sri Gunanand, and edited by Daniel Wright, M.D.; Dr. H Dictionary of Islam; Mr. T. G. Scott's Burma; the translation of the Mahabharata; and a reprint of Vol. I. Researches. To the August number of the Indian Ant Mr. Murray-Aynsley contributes No. VI. of his \"Discourses towards the comparative study of Asiatic Symbols treating of Sacred Trees; Mr. Patlibai Wadia adds a new set his illustrations of Folk-Lore in Western India; Mr. Fleet out the extreme importance of his sixth-century Mandascription of Yasodharman and Vishnuvardhana, supplyin text in Roman characters and a facsimile of the original. fessor Kielhorn continues his notes on the Mahabhashya Walter Elliot communicates a further notice of the Buddhist Structure at Negapatam; and Mrs. Grierson's Index is carried on to the word \"Red.\" Of the two headed \"Miscellanea,\" Mr. Fleet's will be noticed later on \"Epigraphy\"; the other signed G. M. C. objects to a passage preface of Dr. Petersen's edition of the Subhashitavali of bhadeva, on which no more need be said than that one of the able Editors of the Indian Antiquary then on the spot, conc the objection. As to the book itself, Dr. B\u00fchler writes th Petersen \"has now given us, in conjunction with Pandit Du sada of Jaipur, an edition which certainly will be most useful, indispensable to every Sanskritist, both for the critical r of many classical texts, and for the study of the history or c poetry.\"\n\nOn June 22nd, 1865, was held the first public meeting for lishing the Palestine Exploration Fund,\u2014and on the same\nSociety are about to issue a second edition of Mr. Walter Budge's Babylonian Life and History; and Mr. S. A. Smith, an American Assyriologist, has made arrangements with a continental publisher for a new work on the texts of Assurbanipal, the annals of that king by the late Mr. George Smith being out of print.\n\nArabic.\u2014Attention is drawn in the Athen\u00e6um of the 21st, and Academy of the 28th August, to the publication of an English-Arabic Vocabulary, compiled by Major G. S. Plunkett, R.E., and already found of great practical utility in manuscript. It is said to contain 3600 words of the common Cairo-spoken dialect. A grammar of Colloquial Arabic has, moreover, been lately published in Germany. It is advertised as Sabbag's (Mih\u0101'il) Grammatik der Arabischen Umgangsprache hrsg. v. H. Thorbecke. The Athen\u00e6um of August 28th also states that nine out of ten volumes of Burton's translation of the Thousand and One Nights have been issued to the Kama Shastra Society. Five further volumes are now offered for subscription, the first and second having the 'terminal' stories of the Breslau edition. Vol. iii. will comprise the selection of tales in vol. vi. of Dr. Jonathan Scott's Arabian Nights, and vols. iv. and v. will contain Galland's ten most popular tales not yet traced to an Arabic source. These, for the sake of uniformity, will be turned first into Arabic, then retranslated into English. A book which has made its mark, and may here be appropriately mentioned, is Professor Robertson Smith's \"Kinship and Marriage in Early Arabia.\" Among other reviews of it there is one in the Athen\u00e6um of the 17th July, and another in the last-received number of the Literatur-Blatt f\u00fcr Orientalische Philologie. The Athen\u00e6um of the 24th July writes of Mr. Arthur Wollaston's Half Hours with Muhammad that \"it contains a great deal of solid reading in a small but substantial volume.\"\n\nVon Kremer's few pages, entitled Lexikographische Notizen nach Neuere Arabischen Quellen, will interest Arabic scholars, many of whom may have words to add to the collection.\n\nDr. G. P. Badger\u2014than whom few Arabic scholars are better qualified for the somewhat ungracious office of literary criticism\u2014has reviewed, in the Academy of August 21, vols. ii. and iii. of the Rev. G. M. Wherry's Comprehensive Commentary on the Qur\u00e1n. His assurance that \"a translation of the al-Kur\u00e1n which shall preserve the ideas and brilliant imagery, the verve and musical cadence of the original, is still among the desiderata of English Orientalists,\" should arouse the ambition of some of our rising Arabicists. Did two combine\u2014the one a thorough scholar, the other an experienced litt\u00e9rateur and Orientalist\u2014the goal might be attained. In the meanwhile, the reading public must be thankful for Sale, and those to whom Dr. Badger refers as having improved upon certain of his renderings.\n\nAryan Languages.\u2014Sanskrit.\u2014The \"Dharmasamgraha,\" adverted to in July as ready for publication, has been reviewed in the Athen\u00e6um of the 21st August, and is pronounced a more solid contribution to the study of Buddhism than those contained in the\nthree previous numbers of the Aryan Series of the \"Oxoniensa.\" A passing tribute is paid to the memory original editor, the late Kenjiu Kasawara, whose \"quiet z patient industry\" are qualities not always recognized by the world. We are informed in the same issue that M. P. I Professor of Sanskrit in the Facult\u00e9 des Lettres at Lyons of works on Sanskrit rhetoric, has just brought out with E. a volume of Essais de Linguistique \u00c9volutionniste.\n\nAccording to the Academy of June 12, Messrs. Warne are preparing 250 copies of a new edition, on large paper Fables of Pilpay, recently issued in the Chandos Classi Professor Oldenberg has contributed a learned essay on th of Sanskrit to the June number of the Deutsche Rundsch same paper states that at a late meeting of the Acad Inscriptions, M. Bergaigne read a paper upon \"The order Hymns in the Rig-Veda.\" The subject has already been by Mr. Frederic Pincock, in an article which appeared Royal Asiatic Society's Journal so far back as July, 1884.\n\nThe fifth volume of Catalogue of Manuscripts in the Library at Berlin has been received for the Society's Lib contains the second volume of Weber's Catalogue of Prakrit MSS., and is admirably printed and arranged.\n\nIn the Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, o an abstract has been above recorded, it is worthy of note less than six important papers bear more or less directly on studies. One by Professor Bloomfield on Three Hymns First Book of the Atharva-Veda, quotes translations by Zimmer and Ludwig. The new edition of this work \"von P. Pandit\" is noticed by B\u00fchlcr in the Oesterreichische Mona for July.\n\nProfessor B\u00fchlcr's new translation of the \"Laws of Man Professor Oldenberg's Grihya-Sutras (describing the ceremonies of the Brahmans), are stated by the Athen\u00e6u forthcoming in the current year's Sacred Books of the East.\n\nPali.\u2014The continuation of the translation, by Professo Davids and Hermann Oldenberg, of the Vinaya Texts, con vol. xx. \"Sacred Books of the East,\" \"will confer,\" acco the reviewer in the Athen\u00e6um of August 21, \"a valuable those who are desirous of realizing from an English versio thing of the inner life of the earlier Buddhism.\" The firs chapters now given treats of the settlement of disputes fraternity of monks; elsewhere is treated the matter of d daily routine, and there is a chapter dealing with the duti bhikkhunis or nuns.\n\nPrakrit.\u2014There is a thoughtful review in the Athen\u00e6um 10th July of vol. xxii. of the Sacred Books of the East, th cation of which was notified in our last issue. Professor learned introduction to the Ak\u0101rdanga Sutra\u2014or 'Ayara the reviewer holds it to be, in that form of Prakrit con the distinctly sacred language of the sect to which it re\ncommended to the reader's careful consideration; and of the contents of the two works translated he says \"the literature is at least fresh to the Western world.\" The Kalpa Sutra had indeed appeared in English nearly forty years ago, but the version then made is referred to as inaccurate, nor is it easily procured.\n\nAmong recently published works in Sanskrit (or therewith connected), which have not been yet enumerated, may be mentioned:\n\nC. Wilkins, Fables and Proverbs from Hitopadesa (Routledge). Hemacandra's Ling\u0101nu\u1e63\u0101sana \u00fcb. und hrg. v. O. Franke. Capeller (C.), Sanskrit W\u00f6rterbuch part 1. Jacobi (H.), Erz\u00e4hlungen in Mah\u0101r\u0101shtri. Rev. B. Hale Wortham, The Satakas of Bhartrihari, one of many graceful renderings into English by the same author from the original Sanskrit.

D. B. Sanjana.\n\nPersian.\u2014In the Academy of 5th June, mention is made of a portrait, skilfully etched by Mr. Costello, of Mr. Edward Fitzgerald, translator of Umar Khayy\u0101m. The term \"translator\" must not be accepted in its conventional sense as regards this gentleman's treatment of his favourite Persian poet, whose ideas he grasped and rendered into English verse with marvellous skill and appreciation\u2014playing variations, as it were, on his theme, at each call for a new edition. A later Academy of the 14th August has a new and pleasant version of one of Umar's \"Rub\u00e1i'y\u00e1t,\" by Mr. C. J. Pickering; and in the number of the 21st idem, we learn that M. Vedder's illustrations to the complete set of the poet's quatrains will be issued during the current year.\n\nThe third volume of the Collections Scientifiques de l'Institut des Langues Orientales du Minist\u00e8re des Affaires \u00c9trang\u00e8res has just been issued at St. Petersburg. It is a Catalogue of Persian Manuscripts, with lengthy and instructive extracts from the more rare or important. Russia has done wisely in thus encouraging by direct Government aid the study of Oriental tongues; and it is pleasant to see a title-page proclaiming that her Foreign Office, under the orders and at the cost of its Asiatic Department, performs functions which, in England, are assigned to the Trustees of the British Museum. The Baron Rosen divides his work very much in the same way as Dr. Ricu, to the merits of whose \"ouvrage classique\" and to the direct bearing of which upon his own labours he pays a graceful tribute at the outset. To cover the whole ground of classification, he takes the twenty heads of Th\u00e9ologie des B\u00e2bya, Histoire, Cosmographie et G\u00e9ographie, Insh\u00e2, Biographie des Po\u00e8tes, Po\u00e9sie et Belles Lettres, M\u00e9trique et Prosodie, Prose Orn\u00e9e, Fables et Contes, \u00c9thique et Politique, \u0152ufisme, C\u00e9r\u00e9monies Religieuses, M\u0153urs et Coutumes, Lexicographie et Grammaire, Astronomie,\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\nM\u00e9decine, Hippologie, Art de tirer de l'Arc, Trait\u00e9 sur la Ph:\nand Calligraphie et Peinture. Practically, however, the\nand 6th of these comprise the bulk of the collection, for the\n255 pages out of 324, History and Poetry alone requiring n\n200. The Preface calls attention to two B\u00e1bi MSS., wh\nthe extracts given, must be greatly interesting: they are :\ntheir kind, and form, indeed, the whole collection comp\nunder the first of the heads above recapitulated.

Houtsma remarks that although th\ntion cannot compare numerically with that of the Oriental\nthe Imperial Public Library and Asiatic Museum, it fairly holds its own when the intrinsic value of its Persian MSS. is considered. He does not see that it has gained much from Russia's connection with Central Asia, with the exception, perhaps, of the B\u00e1b\u00ed contributions and Seljuki records. It has helped to make us acquainted with certain masterpieces of Persian calligraphists; and he considers that thanks are due to the Russian Government, and especially to Herr Gamazoff, for enabling the compiler of the catalogue to supply many interesting details on questions worthy of research.\n\n\"Oriental Penmanship: Specimens of Persian Handwriting,\" by the late Professor Palmer, and edited by Mr. Frederic Pincock, is favourably noticed in the Athen\u00e6um of the 31st July. According to the reviewer, \"the book will prove an undoubted boon to the student, and cannot fail to be appreciated by the many who need its practical teaching.\" It is illustrated with facsimiles from original specimens in the South Kensington Museum.\n\nWhile on the subject of Persian literature, a word must be said in favour of the new edition of Atkinson's translation of the Shah-n\u0101meh printed by the Oriental Fund in 1832, and now brought out in the Chandos Classics by the Rev. J. A. Atkinson, M.A., son of the translator. So cheap and excellent a reprint of so notable a work should command an exceptionally large circulation.\n\nBarb (H. A.), Transcriptions, Grammatik der Persischen Sprache, is in the Athen\u00e6um's List of New Books.\n\nIndia.\u2014Under this head there is little relating to any special language or dialect to be reported. Among general items, the following may be noticed:\n\nThe Athen\u00e6um of the 19th Juno reviews the \"Local Muhammadan Dynasties\u2014Gujarat,\" by the late Sir E. C. Bayley, a work partially based on a translation by the late Professor Dowson. On the 26th id. it passes a favourable judgment on the Memorials of the Life and Letters of Sir Herbert Edwardes, a biography of unquestionable interest; and notices Mr. MacRitchie's Accounts of the Gypsies of India, a book which, it is alleged, is more successful in its treatment of the European than Asiatic members of the tribe. In the same number is a justly-accorded meed of approval for Capt. R. C. Temple's second volume of Legends of the Panjab, and \"the industry and conscientious care\" with which its contents have been prepared. The Athen\u00e6um of the 3rd July says of Col. Yule's Glossary of Anglo-Indian words, that the author has \"added another important work to those classical productions of his, 'Ser Marco Polo,' and 'Cathay and the Way Thither';\" and of Mr. Edwin Arnold's India Revisited, that \"it contains a series of glowing word-pictures, suited alike to the subject and to the writer himself.\" In the issue of the 21st August, it notifies the proposed change of title for Capt. Temple's Panjab Notes and Queries, which are to be known from the current month (October) under the more comprehensive name of Indian Notes and Queries. On the 28th idem it reviews Mr. Talboys Wheeler's India under British Rule, saying of the author that, \"In his estimates of men\nand events, he is always shrewd and seldom glaringly one-\nand it informs its readers that a collection of Indian Folk-t\nthe Rev. Charles Swynnerton, about to be published by N\nStock, is said to contain many stories derived from oral r\nby natives, and illustrations by native artists. The Academ\n26th June notices the revised edition of Thornton's Gazettee\nby Sir Roper Lethbridge and Mr. Arthur Wollaston. On\nJuly it reviews Selections from the Letters, Despatches a\nState Papers preserved in the Bombay Secretariat, rema\nthe Marathi Series, vol. i. that there is \"hardly a misprin\nable in the whole volume.\"\n\nDravidian Languages.\u2014Tamil, Telugu.\u2014Captain Ten\ngiven in the Book Notices of the Indian Antiquary for Au\ninstructive account of the Sacred Kurrall of Tiruvalluvah Na\nwhich Dr. Pope is about to publish in the form of \"a\nrevised text, accompanied with a metrical version in En\ngrammatical excursus, and a complete lexicon and concord\n\nCalcutta Review.\u2014The July number of this publication h\noriginal articles, independently of the usual monthly no\nsummaries. These are: 1. The Russians in Oriental Li\nby Colonel F. H. Tyrrell, a suggestive paper, dealing with s\nwhich has never, perhaps, been exhaustively treated, bu\nmerits attention. Col.

Hale Wortham's \"Satakas of Bhartrihari,\" said to be \"well worth translation,\" and to have been \"admirably translated.\"\n\nUnder Vernacular Literature are four books: 1. Ary\u0101nari G\u0101th\u0101, by Megnath Bhattacharya, B.A. (People's Press, Calcutta). Stories of great Indian women, Rajput, Mahratta and Bang\u0101li, illustrative of rare female virtues, \"related in simple and artless verse,\" described, moreover, as \"the highest and most precious of all kinds of poetry,\u2014the poetry of life and the poetry of action.\" 2. Usha-chariit, by Dinanath Dhara (Girish Press, Dacca). Ostensibly the memoir of a child who died in his fifteenth year, but in reality a picture of the father who wrote the memoir. \"The book has some interest for the general public... in connection with the sad story of the child, and the sadder story of its unfortunate parents.\" 3. Debatattica, by Kishorilal Raya (Gupta Press, Calcutta). This is explained to be an attempt at a \"rationalistic exposition\" of Hindu Mythology. 4. Kanakanjali, by Akshaya Kumar Baral (Bijnaur Press, Calcutta). The critic, after dispensing censure and praise, thus concludes his notice: \"Babu Akshaya Kumar possesses the true poetic vein, and his work contains much true poetry. If we have spoken more of the faults than of the merits of his poetry, it is because we feel proud of him as a young Bengali poet, and therefore desire to see his poetry become more perfect. His merits are already too well known and appreciated to require laudation from us.\"\n\nBurmese.\u2014The Athen\u00e6um of September 4 informs its readers that in the first batch of 1200 palm-leaf books, forming the Royal Library of Mandalay, now on its way to England, are five volumes of a Burmese work entitled \"Po-tay-kay Ya-za-win,\" or a history of the Portuguese in Burma. It gives an amusing picture of the struggle for ascendancy between that nation and the Spaniards, Dutch, French, and English respectively.\n\nPanjab Notes and Queries for July has an interesting account of a singular local belief among the Burmese that the day of birth affects the name and life of the individual. It contains also a long paragraph under the head of Burmese Wise-men and Doctors; one on the Burmese calendar of luck; one on Burmese metal work; and one on Paper-making in Burma.\n\nChinese.\u2014Dr. Legge's Texts of Confucianism (before mentioned among the Sacred Books of the East) are favourably reviewed in the Athen\u00e6um of the 24th July. With the appearance of this work, the learned Professor, it is stated, has brought the translation of all the Confucian texts to a close: the reviewer adds:\u2014\"We congratulate him on the completion of his task, and it is not too much to say that no one but himself would have been capable of accomplishing so herculean a labour.\" Another volume by the same skilful hand has also been published during the current year at the Oxford Clarendon Press. It is especially well got up, and has a sketch-map and nine characteristic and well-executed illustrations.\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\nThe outside title is The Travels of Fa-hien.

After some few data on the growth of Liberian coffee and cocoa in the Dutch Indian possessions, the Annamite Tales and Legends of M. Landes are resumed and brought to a conclusion\u2014at least for the time. They already form a tolerably large collection of stories and fables and folk-lore.\n\nJapanese.\u2014The Academy of June 5th repeats from the native local papers that Mr. Basil Hall Chamberlain has been requested to lecture on the Japanese language and literature to Japanese students at the University of Tokio. It was in this same University that Professor Bunyiu Nanjo, who learnt Sanskrit at Oxford and received an honorary English degree, instructed Buddhist priests in the elements of Sanskrit and ancient literature of Buddhism. The number of the 26th June, noticing a History of Japan by Percy Thorpe, comes to the conclusion that, while it will not be of much service to the student, it will be useful to those who merely wish to \"know something\" about that country. The same paper on the 28th August begins the last paragraph of a review of Mr. Audsley's Ornamental Arts of Japan, by stating that \"in this splendid work... we have the most perfect view of Japanese Art which has yet been published.\" We learn from the Athen\u00e6um of the 24th July that Mr. Francis Galton, the President of the Anthropological Institute, in closing the series of conferences at South Kensington, announced the establishment of an Anthropological Institute in Japan, of which the secretary is a Japanese gentleman who recently took honours at Cambridge.\n\nWe have received vol. ix. parts 1 and 2 of the Transactions of the Seismological Society of Japan. Part i. has papers on Earthquake Frequency, Earth Currents, and the Automatic Current Recorder; part ii. gives an instructive and comprehensive account of the more important volcanoes. Vol. iii. of the Transactions has just been published in the Japanese language. Of quite recent publications the following should be also noted: Easy Conversations in English, German, and Japanese, first series, second edition, by F. Warrington Eastlake (Tokio, Z. P. Maruya & Co., 1886); Nippon Shokubutsuumei, or Nomenclature of Japanese Plants in Latin, Japanese, and Chinese, by J. Matsumura, supervised by R. Yatabe (Tokio, Maruya, 1884); The Meiji Kwaiwa-Hen, a Treasury of Conversational Phrases in English and Japanese, parts i. and ii. (Tokio, Maruya, 1886).\n\nTurkish.\u2014According to the Athen\u00e6um of the 26th June, a number of Magyar literati were about to visit Constantinople in company with Professor Vamb\u00e9ry. Dr. Ignatz Kunost, a philologist of the same nationality, had been engaged for some time in Asia, studying the common or spoken Turkish, as well as the Folk-lore of the Turkish provinces, with a view to the publication by the Hungarian Academy of the result of his inquiries.\n\nThe Reverend H. P. Tozer, reviewing Mrs. Walker's \"Eastern\nLife and Scenery, with Excursions in Asia Minor,\" in the Ac of the 12th June, remarks \"the author always writes pleas and sometimes with a vein of originality.\"\n\nEgypt and Egyptology.\u2014Under this head one of the most important items of intelligence is the resignation by Professor Maspero his Superintendence of excavations and collection of antiquities in Egypt, an office to which he succeeded on the death of Mariette Pasha, and which he has administered with remarkable zeal and ability for a period of five years. His courteous assuming manner, and readiness to impart information to the travellers visiting the Bulak Museum, were as conspicuous for the depth and soundness of his knowledge. One of his latest acts\u2014unfolding the mummies of Rameses II. and III.\u2014has been celebrated in a proc\u00e8s verbal, of which a reprint appears in the Academy of 3rd July. The latter paper, in confirming the report of his resignation, announces that Professor Maspero's successor in the service of the Khedive will be his pupil, M. Eug\u00e8ne Gr\u00e9baut, an Egyptologist of proved distinction.\n\nIn the Academy of the 26th June is an interesting letter from Mr. Flinders Petrie, giving some results of his exploration of the hitherto unexamined site of Defennch (pronounced Deffench), the Talpanhes, Taphne (LXX.), and Daphne of antiquity. His argument that this was the earliest Greek town in Egypt, as well as that the site was one of the X Dynasty, wholly free from later remains, gives additional importance to the subject. Above all, we have now him a new and valuable authority that here is \"Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes\" (Jerem. xliii. 9), and that the \"brickwork pavement\" which was \"at the entry,\" is exactly explained by the large paved area outside of the palace opposite to the entry. It should be observed that the words in the Old Version, where the prophet is commanded to hide stones in \"the clay in the kiln,\" are changed in the Revised Version to hide them in \"in the brickwork\"; moreover, that a marginal note infers that they may mean \"lay them with mortar in the pavement (or square).\n\nThe same paper of July 3 contains a review by Mr. J. Butler of Mr. Stanley Lane Poole's \"Art of the Saracenic Egypt,\" a work illustrated with more than one hundred gravings. As an essay on the whole subject of Egyptian medieval art, the reviewer would have wished it to convey a clearer conception than it does of the term \"Saracenic,\" with reference to \"Coptic.\" As a hand-book, he recognizes in it \"a valuable addition to the art hand-books of the South Kensington Museum,\" and holds it \"difficult to over-colour the praise it deserves.\"\n\nAt a special meeting of the Egypt Exploration Fund, held in the theatre of the Royal Institution, Albemarle Street, on Tuesday, the 6th July, for the purpose of hearing Mr. Ernest Gardner lecture on recent excavations, Mr. Petrie's Memoir on Naqada, then just ready for issue to subscribers, was placed on the table.\n\nThe following items are gathered from the Academy:\n\nVOL. XVIII.\u2014[NEW SERIES.]\n23rd June, Miss Amelia B. Edwards received from Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts, the degree of LL.D., \"in recognition of her services to Egyptological research;\" and on the following day the same degree was conferred upon Mr. Reginald Stuart Poole (already an hon. LL.D. of Cambridge and Corresponding Member of the Institute of France), by Dartmouth College, New Jersey. The recipients are both honorary secretaries of the Egypt Exploration Fund. On the 17th July, the honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy was also conferred on Miss Edwards by the College of the Sisters of Bethany in Kansas, \"in recognition of her work in the field of Scriptural archaeology.\"\n\nThe question of evidence against antiquity borne by \"kiln-burnt bricks\" may now be considered to have been fairly solved. Mr. Flinders Petrie, in a letter of the 10th July, states that last winter he found \"three instances of baked bricks in Egypt dating from 1200 B.C.;\" and certainly none later than 700 B.C.;\" while Professor Sayce, writing on the 21st inst., points out that the bricks \"composing the old fortress of Gebelin, south of Thebes, are stamped with the cartouches of Ra-men-kheper and Isis-m-khel of the (illegitimate) XXI. Dynasty,\" besides other examples. As the first of the kings of the XXII. Dynasty is said to have been the Shishak of Scripture, the period alluded to may reasonably be inferred about 1000 B.C.\n\nIn the issue of the 7th August, Miss Edwards describes Professor Maspero's discovery, in February, of a piece of inscribed limestone containing a complete version of the contents of the Berlin papyrus No. 1, best known by his own translation, entitled \"Les Aventures de Sinouhit,\" and by the English version styled \"the Story of Sancha,\" from the pen of the late C. W. Goodwin. The period at which this tale was written is involved in doubt, but it is affirmed to be \"older by many centuries than the time of Moses\"; and the find has been of great general value in archaeological research. The same number of the Academy notifies that M. Edouard Naville, the discoverer of Pithom, has been decorated by the Emperor of Germany with the order of the Red Eagle, in honour of the completion of his great work, the comparative edition of \"the Ritual,\" or Book of the Dead.\n\nIn addition to Professor Maspero's proc\u00e8s verbal, to which we have already referred, a second paper of a similar nature signed by him, describing the unwrapping of the Mummies of Sekenen-ra and Seti I., in presence of General Stephenson and many officers and ladies residing at Cairo, on the 9th June, appears in the number of the 31st July. To this is added, in that of the 14th August, his Report to the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions, in which he mentions the singular fact that among the mummies was found the body of a young man, between 25 and 30 years of age, bearing neither name nor inscription, showing signs of death in extreme agony. The Athen\u00e6um of September 4 states that Professor the Abb\u00e9 Hyvernat is preparing a pal\u00e6ographic atlas in Coptic.\n\nAmong late works on Egypt are noted: Lef\u00e8bure (G.), Les\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\nHypog\u00e9es Royaux de Th\u00e8bes. 1\u00e8re division. Le tombeau I. Paris, Leroux. Egypt Exploration Fund, vol. iii., No. part i. (with 44 plates), by Mr. W. M. Flinders Petrie, also by Messrs. Cecil Smith, Ernest Gardner, and Barclay V. H.\n\nEpigraphy.\u2014Among the more interesting epigraphical discoveries of the quarter is that raised by Mr. Fleet in his contribution to the Indian Antiquary for July, under the respective headings \u201cThe Epoch of the Gupta Era,\u201d and \u201cMandasor Inscription of Kumaragupta and Bandhuvarmans\u201d\u2014the last being No. 16 of the series of papers on \u201cSanskrit and Old-Kanarese Inscriptions.\u201d The question of the accuracy of particular readings of an inscription but one of the bearing of the inscription itself on Indian history and chronology. His main contention from the new date evidence has been obtained to prove the correctness of Albrecht\u2019s statement that the Gupta Era began \u201cwithin a year or two on either side of A.D. 319\u201320\u201d: that the same authority was in making this the epoch of the extermination, instead of the power of the Guptas; and that, under another name, the Vikrama Era did exist anterior to A.D. 544. Should any hesitations be felt in accepting these results, Mr. Fleet would invite attention to the G\u00f4lm\u00e2dh\u00eetol Inscription of the Mah\u00e2r\u00e2ja Sivadeva Managriha in Nepal (discovered and published some months ago by Mr. Cecil Bendall), in which he finds the most valuable confirmation of his conclusions. This inscription is dated in the year without specification of era. Sivadeva I. is shown in the contemporary with the Mahasamanta Am\u00fbvarman, whose approximate date, viz. about A.D. 637, was, Mr. Fleet writes, well known from Hiouen Tsiang\u2019s mention of him.\u201d According to Dr. Bhagwanlal Indraji, the years 34, 35, and 45, on certain inscriptions of Am\u00fbvarman, belong to the era established by Harshavardhana of Kanauj, commencing in A.D. 589 or 607. It therefore follows that the date of 318 for Sivadeva must refer to an era commencing about 300 years prior to Harshavardhana. The first-mentioned Gupta Era, beginning \u201cwithin a year or two on either side of A.D. 319\u201320,\u201d is the one which is argued, \u201cexactly meets the requirements of the calculation 319+318=A.D. 637.\u201d Mr. Fleet then proceeds to consider how this particular era came to be introduced into Nepal, a circumstance which he attributes to the conquest of the country by either the Guptas or the rulers of Vallabhi, whose first permanent sovereign was Dharasena IV. To those interested in a solution of the question, B\u00fchler\u2019s paper in the Sitzungsberichte der Phil. hist. Classe a der Akademie der Wissenschaften may be commended for perusal. Entitled \u201cEine Inschrift des K\u00f6nigs Dharasena IV. von Vaishnavi\u201d and its reprint as a separate pamphlet has quite recently appeared.\n\nThe Oesterreichische Monatschrift f\u00fcr den Orient for August contains a note on Professor Sayce\u2019s two Van Inscriptions. The latter is said to be identical with one published by D. M\u00fcller in the Records of the Imperial Academy of Science. The second inscription, eleven lines engraved on red sandstone, is supposed to have\nan enumeration of sacrifices; but it is broken away on both sides, and the beginning and end are wanting.\n\nWe gather from the Academy of 14 August that, at a late meeting of the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions, Mr. Schlumberger exhibited rubbings of a mysterious inscription found at Ak Higar (Thyatira) in Lydia. It is engraved on three sides of a stone which now forms the base of a wood pillar in a caravansara. On the fourth side may be distinguished the legs of a human being. The characters of the inscription bear no resemblance to those classed as Hittite; some have rather the appearance of bad copies of Egyptian hieroglyphics.\n\nNumismatics.\u2014The Athen\u00e6um of July 31 reviews Mr. Eugene Leggett\u2019s \u201cMint Towns and Coins of the Muhammadans from the Earliest Period to the Present Time,\u201d but thinks it unfortunate that the designer of so excellent a programme should have set about his work with inadequate preparation. Pointing out certain inaccuracies and defects of arrangement and execution, it admits that the compilation contains a great deal of information which it must have cost pains to gather, and that the labour expended on it is obviously of love. The same paper notes the cataloguing by Mr. Stanley Lane Poole of the little-known cabinet of coins in the Library of Christ Church, Oxford, and notifies the completion of Mr. Poole\u2019s Catalogue of Muhammadan coins in the Bodleian Library. On the 14th August the Athen\u00e6um begins a long review of volumes ii. and iii. of the International Numismata Orientalia, with the statement that the whole work \u201cowed its existence to a scholar of singularly wide attainments and a publisher whose zeal for learning outstripped even his remarkable business capacity.\u201d It need hardly be added that allusion is made to Mr. Edward Thomas and Mr. Nicholas Tr\u00fcbner. Vol. i. was completed in 1878; vol. ii. in 1881; vol. iii. part 1 in 1882; and part 2 at a very recent date. It is to the last that attention is now mainly directed, Sir Walter Elliot\u2019s essay on the Coins of Southern India, regarding which a pregnant sentence of the review merits quotation: \u201cIt is a matter of general felicitation that the only living scholar who has acquired a mastery over this perplexing subject should have been able practically to achieve his work before failing sight rendered the personal examination of the coins impossible.\u201d\n\nIn the first number of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for the current year, Mr. Oliver discourses on some copper coins of Akbar, of which a bag of several hundred had been brought to him by a Baniy\u00e1. He mentions, as a curious fact, that in this one find are included specimens of the whole twelve Persian months from Fanvardin to Isfandarmuz, in many cases of several mints.\n\nVienna Congress.\u2014The representatives of the Royal Asiatic Society at the Seventh International Congress, held at Vienna while these pages are in the press, are Dr. R. N. Cust, Honorary Secretary, Professors Cecil Bendall, M.A., Terrien de Lacouperie, and Mr. George Grierson, Members of the Council, and Dr. Theodore Duka, Member. It is hoped to publish the Hon. Secretary\u2019s Summary of Proceedings in the January number of the Journal.\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\nCORRIGENDA TO PART II. VOL. XVIII.\n\nP. 383, 2nd par., 9th line.

HENRY YULE, R.E., C.B., PRESIDENT\nIN THE CHAIR.\n\nOPENING ADDRESS.\n\nI shall not occupy much of your time, but it seems right and desirable on this our Anniversary that the who, somewhat unaccountably to himself, finds himself in the Chair of this Society, should say something of position and current history of the Society.\n\nWhat first strikes us is the melancholy retrospect of past winter. It is like the survey of a battle-field. has been busy in all circles, but it seems as if he wielded his weapon nowhere more actively than in small corner occupied by our Society,\u2014striking down several of our most eminent and valuable members Vaux, Dr. Birch, Sir Walter Medhurst, Sir Arthur P. James Fergusson, Edward Thomas, and Sir William Johnson. Full records of all these will appear in Annual Report, but I could not let this occasion pass speaking particularly of some of them, with whose co\nances we are most familiar, and whose loss seems to change the aspect of our body, as the removal of the most familiar spires and towers of Westminster would change the aspect of that quarter of our capital.\n\nWith Mr. Vaux I can hardly say that I enjoyed intimacy, though our relations were always cordial and kindly. Phayre, Fergusson, and Thomas I had long been permitted to count as familiar friends. All that I will say of Mr. Vaux is that this Society owes him a heavy debt of gratitude. The Society had reached rather a low ebb when he joined us, but the result of his exertions, heavily weighted as they were by his deteriorated sight, was to raise both our list of membership and the quality of the Journal to a far higher level; whilst his kindly helpful spirit was ever ready to assist inquirers. . . . . . .\n\nThe next whom we had to lament was James Fergusson, intimately associated with the Society ever since any of us here present have known it. He, like Phayre, was a man who, in the main, educated himself. Sent to India at an early age, he was brought up as a planter and a merchant in Bengal, i.e. in the Delta of the Ganges, which hardly affords the trace of an ancient building. His inborn taste led him to give himself to the study of architecture, and to devote the earliest opportunities afforded by leisure and means to travelling over India, in days when such travelling was a laborious business, examining, comparing, and drawing its ancient remains. His membership of this Society dates from 1844. His active mind and indefatigable industry found wide and various fields, the connexion of all of which is to be found in paths binding them either to taste or to construction. Of his Oriental work we would naturally speak most prominently here. That embraced his \"Illustrations of Ancient Indian Architecture,\" \"The Rock Temples of\n\n1 Here follow three or four paragraphs which will be found in the President's Obituary Notice of Sir Arthur Phayre at page x.\nIndia\" (the subject of one of his latest, as it was of his earliest works), that treasure-house the volume of his great series on the \"History of Architecture\") treats of Indian and Oriental styles, the two editions of remarkable book so rich in varied interest which he \"Tree and Serpent Worship,\" and numerous papers the Transactions of this and other societies on subject Indian Architecture and Arch\u00e6ology. Another branch study which he pursued with the keenest ardour and ac was the topography of Jerusalem, the dates of its ren and the identity of the most noted sites: these gave to a whole series of dissertations, including his articles i \"Dictionary of the Bible,\" enough of themselves to have a man famous. A third subject embraced his ide fortification, and their application to the defence of our j Though his particular theories were not accep publication on this subject in 1849 led to his subse appointment to the Committee of National Defence, and no small bearing on the defences actually carried out. Thr his Jerusalem studies, and the interest and controversy created, he was, in effect, the father of the Survey of the City and of the Palestine Exploration Fund, and of all it has accomplished and may yet accomplish. The lig of Greek temples was another subject on which he original views, and strong ones, as he did on most sub and which he applied in the latter years of his life to Kew gallery which he designed for Miss North, when accomplished and munificent lady presented it, along her beautiful drawings of tropical vegetation, to the N: The decoration of St. Paul's was another matter in v he took a prominent part, but it is a burning subject an Asiatic Society has no call to meddle with its troversies. Mr. Fergusson's was a character which ill in various ways the perferidum ingenium proverb signed to his countrymen. His convictions on all sul\nwere intense. When he put forward a proposition, it was very far from his intention that it should be moulded or whittled by hostile hands: the character *qualis ab incepto* generally applied to any opinion of his, and in controversy he hit very hard, and too often needlessly hard. Even those who gave and took hard knocks in strife with him ache, we trust, no longer. We, again, and there are many of us, whose happier fortune it was to have no such passages of arms with him, look back only to his ripe sagacity, his kindly appreciation of our work, his constant readiness to open the matchless stores of his knowledge, and the rich abundance of his collections in books and photographs, to those who sought help in their researches.\n\nNext on our casualty-roll is Edward Thomas, and time allows me but to say a word of that honest, friendly soul, whose name was recognized over Europe as a prince in Oriental numismatics, and was honoured by assumption into the Foreign Lists of the Institute of France and of the Academy of St. Petersburg. The aggregate of his work is immense, though much of it lies in articles scattered over various periodicals. His name will be preserved by these, by his Chronicles, derived from coinage, of the so-called Patan kings of Delhi, and by his intimate association with the publication of James Prinsep's Essays, with the historical collections of Sir Henry Elliot, and with the new edition of Marsden's Numismata Orientalia.\n\nOn one other subject I will touch before sitting down. Mr. Kay, a respected member of our Council, has recently addressed a letter to our Secretary on a matter of which we are all too conscious, i.e. the deplorably low ebb at which the study of Eastern languages and literature stands in this country, and on which he suggested the formation of a special committee to consider the causes and the possible remedies for this state of things. I feel strongly the truth of Mr. Kay's observations, and I may say in passing, and in all sincerity, that if things were in a better state, this chair would not\nbe filled as it is to-day. But what I wish to n\nis that we are attempting to carry out Mr. Kay's sugg\nand along with them to devise means for extendi\nmembership of this Society and the interest in its p\nA special committee has accordingly been named, con\nof Mr. Bendall, Mr. Dickens, Mr. Kay, Gen. Ma\nand Mr. Thornton, with Mr. Cust and our Sec\nex-officio members; and the following heads of inquir\nbeen indicated to them, without excluding others of a l\nkind that may suggest themselves:\n\n1. The preparation of a list of appointments in Eng\nin Government establishments, universities and colleg\nother institutions of sorts\u2014for which a scholarly acqua\nwith Oriental languages is a necessary or imp\nqualification; with the emoluments of each and the\nof appointment.\n\n2. Regarding the possibility of approaching the G\nment, the Universities, the City Companies, etc., for s\nin the promotion of Oriental studies.\n\n3. Regarding the possibility and expediency of amal\ning this Society with any other of kindred objects,\nreducing the scale of subscription now in force.\n\n4. Whether the publication of Oriental works beyo\nscope of the Journal should be undertaken.\n\n5.

His second name, Sandys, was given to him after a distinguished ancestor on the maternal side, who was Archbishop of York in 1576. He was educated...\nat Westminster, a school for which he always retained boyish enthusiasm; and he graduated B.A. of Balliol College, Oxford, in 1840. The following year he was employed in the Department of Antiquities in the British Museum; in January, 1861, he was appointed Keeper of Coins and Medals there, a post which he resigned in 1870. From about this date until 1876 he was engaged on a catalogue of the coins in the Bodleian Library for the University of Oxford. In January, 1876, he became Secretary to the Royal Asiatic Society, and continued in that office until the 21st June, 1893, the day of his death, carrying on his daily routine of work to the 19th idem.\n\nHe was also Honorary Secretary of the Royal Society of Literature from 1852 to 1858, and Secretary from 1858 to 1885, on the 28th January of which latter year he tendered his resignation\u2014finally retiring at the Anniversary in April. Of the Numismatic Society he was President for exactly twenty years, or from November, 1855, to November, 1875.\n\nHe published in 1851 \"Nineveh and Persepolis,\" a volume which reached four editions, and was translated into German; also in the same year a \"Handbook to the Antiquities of the British Museum.\" In 1856 he edited for the Hakluyt Society Sir Francis Drake's \"World Encompassed,\" for which he wrote a very able preface. He made many contributions to Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography in 1854-57.\n\nIn 1863 he deciphered and edited for the Trustees of the British Museum a Collection of ninety Phoenician Inscriptions found at Carthage. In 1868 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1876 he published a Catalogue of the Castellani collection of Antiquities in the University Galleries, Oxford, and the next year \"Greek Cities and Islands of Asia Minor\" for the series of \"Ancient History from the Monuments.\" He added to the same series a history of \"Persia from the Earliest Period to the Arab Conquest.\"\nHis publications in the Numismatic Chronicle are as follows:\n\n1854. On Coins of Alexander the Great. On Rare Bactrian Coins. On Coins of Ceylon; with Remarks on the so-called Ring, and Fish-hook Money.\n\n1856. On Some Greek Coins. Vol. xviii. p. 137.\n\n1857.

Indenture preserved in the Bodleian Library to certain Farthings of James I. Vol. xvi. p. 235.\n\nMuch might be said of the amiable character and accomplishments of the late Mr. Vaux. His work for ten years on behalf of the Asiatic Society has been referred to in the Journal, and more especially in the Hon Secretary's remarks attached to the last year's Report the special care he took to advance the Society's in well as the marked success which attended his\nsuch as could not fail to be appreciated by his fellow citizens. Those who knew him out of this particular sphere of usefulness have borne, and will bear, many witness to the universality of his knowledge, his industry in devotion, his kindly and genial disposition, enthusiasm, and readiness to help and oblige.\n\nThe late Secretary's remains were consigned to the resting place at the Brompton Cemetery, on Friday, June 30th, in the presence of a large gathering.\n\nAmong those of our members whose loss during the last season we have to record, one of the most eminent and most deeply lamented is Sir Arthur Phayre.\n\nHe had not settled among us in London, like others whom we commemorate today. Though born in England, he always regarded himself as Irishman, and in Ireland, after his retirement from active employment, he set up his headquarters. But he regularly visited London in the summer, and was gladly welcomed at the Council-table of our Society, and at the Athen\u00e6um Club. He is sorely missed at both, and we may add, in the councils of his country\u2014for his death occurred just as the conquest of Upper Burma had taken place, and when his advice would have been of the highest value. His last public utterance was a letter which appeared in The Times of 13th October last, in which he gave his unhesitating approval to the military intervention for the deposition of King Thibaw. There could have been no more valuable sanction to the righteousness of that measure. Phayre was not only eminently just, but had ever been the true friend of the King of Burma, and the most moderate of men in his dealings with his government.\n\nArthur Purves Phayre was born at Shrewsbury, 7th May,\n\n---\n\n* The foundation of this notice is one of greater length compiled by me for the February number of the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society. But since then I have been favoured with memoranda by Lieut.-General Sir Richard Meade and by Major-General Barnet Ford, of which advantage has been taken. H. Yule.\n1812, the son of Richard Phayre, Esq., a resident grandson of Colonel Phayre, of Killoughran Forest, county Wexford. He went to India as a Cadet in 182 served for some years with the 7th Bengal N. I. Going into the service, he had not received much instruction from the beginning of his career he was engaged in edu himself. Early friends who survive describe Phayre a young subaltern as hardy and temperate in his reading, thinking, and making notes, delighting in arg sometimes in paradox, and a most agreeable compan camp. In 1834 he was selected for service with one of local corps which often formed a door to employmen higher kind; but nothing important came of this till when he was appointed assistant to the Commissior Arakan, then Captain Bogle (afterwards Sir Archibald).\n\nArakan, though geographically so near Calcutta, v practically one of the most secluded provinces of the its population scanty, and its only communication wi outer world maintained by a sailing vessel which came the Hoogly about once in six weeks. Sir Richard ] who, as a very young officer, stayed with Phayre at A records the impression which the latter then made or that \"he was an officer of thought and judgment far beyo years and standing. In his conversation, his earnest for the welfare and interests of the people of his distri love of justice, and an entire absence of self-asserti indeed of self in any shape, were very striking. O that he was a man of real work and worth. . . . I v member one evening, when I was sitting outside with number of people brought in the body of a hill-tiger, had been killed by a Mugh with a single blow of his The man had been in his house, when he heard a cri the garden, and running out he saw his brother struck by the beast. Seizing his dhaq, he rushed on the tig with one lucky blow in the neck disabled, and th\nit. The brother was not seriously injured. Phayre commended the act in terms which evidently delighted the man and his friends; then going into the house, he brought out a handful of rupees as a reward for his brave deed.\"\n\nIn solitude at Sandoway, where he spent two years of his Arakan service, Phayre had ample scope not only for that study of the Burmese language and character, in which he stood so high, but for the pursuit of that self-cultivation which led all who knew him in later life to regard him as a man of exceptionally good education. The purity of his life, in a province where laxity was the rule rather than the exception, earned the exceptional respect of the people of the country.\n\nAt an early period of Phayre's service in Arakan, we find him associated with Lieut. (now Lieut.-General) Albert Fytche, who long afterwards succeeded him as Chief Commissioner of British Burma, in an expedition for the punishment of a hill-tribe, the Walien, in the upper basin of the Arakan River, whose unexplored fastnesses were supposed to be inaccessible to our arms. The chief stronghold of these caterans, 4000 feet above the valley, was scaled and destroyed, and both Phayre and Fytche received high commendation.\n\nIn 1846 Phayre was transferred to Moulmein as principal assistant to Mr. J. R. Colvin, then Commissioner of the Tenasserim Provinces, and three years later his merits, by this time well known to Government, were rewarded with the Commissionership of Arakan. He held this position when the second Burmese war broke out in 1852, and as soon as the Province of Pegu was annexed to the British dominions, Phayre, not the oldest, but certainly the ablest of the officers associated with Burmese administration, was nominated by Lord Dalhousie to the charge of the new territory.\n\nHe governed the Delta province for ten years as Commissioner. His name, when he entered it, was not strange to the people. His justice and firmness, his great liberality, his mastery of the language, and intimate knowledge of\nthose whom he had ruled in the adjoining province known and appreciated; whilst his commanding figure, dignity, courtesy, and high personal character, his considerate and patient bearing, all combined to win him the favour and confidence of those whom he was called to govern.\n\nThe first two years of his rule in Pegu were filled with anxieties to Phayre. He was especially exercised by the troubles of dacoity in the Tharawadi and other districts. The suppression of this was a service of most harassing character and very unpopular with the army, whilst more than one of good previous reputation broke down under the strain. In those two years (1853-1854) the country greatly quieted down, and from 1855 dates the extraordinary progress made by the new province.\n\nHis authority was in 1862 extended over the whole of the Burmese provinces, which, under the denomination of Lower Burma, embraced a continuous sea-board of 900 miles. His wise and considerate administration, which, among other measures, carried through the abolition of forced labour, the introduction of a stable currency, the development of trade especially in the export of rice, and the effective repression of crime, he laid the foundation of that prosperity which reached a high pitch before his own rule terminated.\n\nFrom the beginning, too, he was determined that the province should pay its way; and whilst he enforced a rigid economy, he maintained also a considerable taxation. But prosperity went on, and immigration flowed in steadily. The population of all the British provinces, Arakan, Tenasserim, and Pegu at the date of the conquest of the last, was probably not less than 1\u00bd million. In 1884 it had grown to 4\u00bd million.\n\nOne of the subjects to which he gave much attention in the latter years of his rule was that of vernacular education. Monastic schools, taught by the p'hungyis, or Buddhist monks, are a peculiar characteristic of the country. Through their agency the proportion of the population who\nand write is very large. Phayre's idea was to bring these monastic schools under the influence of the educational department, by putting in the hands of their indigenous teachers elementary books of sound instruction, and by inducing them to enter the sphere of Government inspection. The plan was carried out, but has not always been viewed with favour by the department concerned; nor have I been able to learn anything very precise as to its success.\n\nPhayre three times went as envoy on the part of the Governor-General to the Court of Burma. The first time was in 1855, with the object (in part) of obtaining the King's assent by treaty to the cession of the delta province. The Envoy's conciliatory manners and thorough acquaintance with Burmese ideas attracted the King's goodwill, but he would assent to no treaty. On this mission I had the honour of being appointed, by Lord Dalhousie, as Secretary to the Envoy, and from that time I date a friendship and correspondence with my admirable chief, which death alone has interrupted, and in which I never ceased to take pride and pleasure.\n\nPhayre's other missions occurred in 1862 and 1866, in connexion with trade matters, and were not very successful. The more than considerate treatment which the King had always met with at Phayre's hands had hardly been appreciated by his Majesty.\n\nPhayre quitted Burma finally in 1867, declining further high employment in India; and greatly did he enjoy his leisure at home, his first visit to Europe since he had gone out nearly forty years before.\n\n---\n\n1 I see that in the year 1884-85 the number of indigenous schools in the list as inspected was:\u2014Monastic schools, 3837; Lay schools, 879. The schools helped by \"grants-in-aid,\" were:\u2014Monastic, 825; Lay, 449. Of Monastic schools inspected 21\u00b76 per cent., with 3414 pupils, are stated to have earned grants for results, and 587 pupils, or 17\u00b72 per cent. of those who earned grants, passed fully by one of the standards. Of Lay schools, again, 51 per cent., with 4622 pupils, or 14\u00b76 per cent. of the total number, earned result-grants, and 1201 pupils, or 26 per cent. of the number who had earned grants, passed the primary school examinations.\nIn 1869 he returned to India as a traveller, visiting, other parts, Kashmir and Peshawar, and their Buc remains, with great interest; and then continuing his jo round the globe by Saigon, China, Japan, San Fran the United States.\n\nOn his return, he took up his abode at Bray, near D and there he continued to have his head-quarters for th of his unemployed life. But his public service was ne ended. In the latter part of 1874 he was nominat Lord Carnarvon to the government of Mauritius, an which he held with satisfaction to the colonists and Queen's Government for more than four years. He re home, after a visit to South Africa, in 1879. His occurred suddenly in his lodgings at Bray, on the nig 14th\u201315th December, 1885. Its announcement was a and a surprise to a circle of friends very strongly attached him. It is true that he was over three-score and three but who ever realized the fact who saw him, youthful and in action, and in his great stature slim and lithe as a palm\n\nIn concluding this abstract of the career of a goo illustrious man, let me note a few of his personal cha istics. Early recollections of Phayre speak of a certain angularity in his aspect and bearing; but assuredly process of self-education that so long went on in hi continual moulding from within, and the long exerc authority and conscious influence, had replaced this, back as my own remembrance of him goes, by a refinement and dignity, whilst there was an unfailing c of manner. These qualities always tended to win him favour among foreigners, and with his sympathy and did him no small service in his government of Ma He was naturally, as those who knew him most inti were aware, of a warm temper, but no man had his under stricter or more habitual control.\n\nAn occupation of some of his later years, resumed fro\nto time, was the preparation of his History of Burma, finally published by Tr\u00fcbner in 1883. It is difficult to attract readers to such a subject, except under the passing stimulus of events directly adding to the matter of Burmese history. But Phayre's work is careful, lucid, and excellent. I have recently been told that he left behind him a carefully revised edition of this History in type. He also published, in 1882, as a fasciculus of the *International Numismata Orientalia*, a work on the coins of Arakan, Pegu, and Burma.\n\nSome fifteen papers on subjects of a similar character, and in part contributions to the eventual preparation of the works mentioned, appeared from time to time between 1841 and 1881, chiefly in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.\n\nLet me conclude with words already used in the obituary notice, to which reference has been made in a note at p. x.\n\n\"Just, humane, magnanimous, beneficent, animated by an extraordinary sense of duty, courteous, modest\u2014I never remember an instance in which himself, or his claims, or his rights, much less his merits, made any part directly or indirectly in his words or acts,\u2014with the wisdom to build up a state, as he built up a great province: what a contemptible thing seems the oratory on which men set such value, and bestow such admiring epithets,\u2014a tool as apt and as often used to destroy a kingdom as to build one up,\u2014beside such a combination of qualities as these!\"\u00b9\n\nDr. Samuel Birch,\u00b2 who was elected an Honorary Member of the Royal Asiatic Society in the year 1866, was the eldest son of the late Rev. Samuel Birch, D.D., Rector\n\n\u00b9 A movement is on foot for the erection of a memorial to Sir Arthur Phayre, of which the Secretary in this country is Major-General Barnet Ford, 31, Queensborough Terrace, W. For the same object a meeting was held at Rangoon, on the 6th of March last. It is I presume a sign of the transitory character of society there that the meeting is reported to have been \"not very numerously attended.\" It was unfortunate that the venerable Roman Catholic Bishop Bigandet, who was one of Phayre's oldest and most valued friends, was unable, probably from his great age, to attend; and that the chief member of the American Mission was also prevented by illness from being present.\n\n\u00b2 Obituary notice supplied by Mr. Th. G. Pinches, British Museum.\nof St. Mary Woolnoth, and Vicar of Little M: Buckinghamshire. His grandfather was Samuel : of Cornhill (the old business still bears the na Birch, though it is not in hereditary hands), who not unknown as an author, and who attained to dignity of Alderman, and was Lord Mayor of Lond 1814-15. Dr. Birch was educated at Greenwich, Black and at Merchant Taylors' School, where he gained distinction, and received an excellent education, which doubtedly stood him in good stead in after-life. In year 1834 he entered Government service, under the missioners of Public Records, and in January, 1836, re an appointment under the Trustees of the British Mu in whose service he passed only a few days less than years. On the retirement of Mr. Barnwell, Dr. Birch l Assistant-Keeper of the Department of Antiquities, whic included the whole range of Greek, Roman, British and O archaeology, as well as numismatics and ethnology. In when this very miscellaneous department was divide Birch was raised to the responsible position of Kee the British, Medi\u00e6val, and Oriental sections; and at subdivision, he was left with the strictly Oriental (Eg Assyrian, Ph\u0153nician, and Himyaritic) Antiquities un charge, retaining the post to the day of his death.\n\nAt a very early period of his life Dr. Birch had Chinese, and his first important duty at the Mu the arrangement and cataloguing of the coins of Chi published, also, several articles and books, of which his lations of the Chinese writings, Friends till Death, Ti Foxes, The Chinese Widow, and The Casket of G be mentioned. One (or more than one) of these works v lated and published in Germany a few years ago. study of the Chinese coinage, Dr. Birch also devot for a time, to the study of the coinage of the ancient I This resulted in the recovery, in 1844, of the roy\nTasciovanus, the father of Cunobelin, from a few abbreviated legends (up to that time unexplained) found on the coins of the period.\n\nIt was to the study of the Egyptian antiquities, language, and literature, however, to which he ultimately devoted himself. Entering upon the study at the time when very little of a trustworthy nature existed, and great discredit had been thrown upon the discoveries already made in the science of Egyptology, Dr. Birch, following in the footsteps of Young and Champollion, made himself, by his detailed studies, so proficient that he may undoubtedly be regarded as one of the founders of the science. It was he who first gave continuous translations of the Egyptian texts\u2014translations which, notwithstanding the progress since made in the study, remain, on the whole, exceedingly exact. Among other things, he made translations of the Hieratic texts published in fac-simile in the Select Papyri, as well as of the well-known Egyptian Book of the Dead\u2014a text containing numberless difficulties.\n\nOf the two hundred or more books or papers by Dr. Birch upon subjects purely Egyptian, the most important (besides those mentioned above) were The Dictionary of Hieroglyphics and Egyptian Grammar, in the 5th vol. of the English edition of Baron Bunsen's Egypt's Place in Universal History, an Introduction to the Study of Hieroglyphics, a Magical Papyrus, the great Harris Papyrus, an Egyptian Reading-book, several Guides to the various galleries of his department in the British Museum, a Catalogue of the Egyptian Antiquities at Alnwick Castle, The Coffin of Amam, etc. etc. When one considers how the time of an official of the British Museum is taken up, the number and thoroughness of Dr. Birch's works can only be regarded as surprising. His great industry it undoubtedly was which made him one of the greatest Egyptologists in the world, with a reputation which was fully acknowledged\nnot only at home, but also in Germany, France, Italy; in fact, wherever notice is taken of the interesting results of the fascinating study to which he had devoted himself.\n\nDr. Birch began, at an early period, the study of Assyrian, but soon found that the acquirement of a useful knowledge of that tongue would necessarily occupy much of the time which could be most profitably employed in studying the subject which he had made his speciality; and the little which he had learnt of Assyrian was forgotten. Nevertheless, he took an active interest in the subject to the end, and was fully alive to the importance of the discoveries made by the later as well as by earlier scholars.\n\nAs Keeper of the Department of Oriental Antiquities, Dr. Birch was certainly pre-eminent. His capabilities as arranger of antiquities were great, but he was much hampered in his work by the very limited space into which he first obliged to pack the various objects, and the great care which have taken place at the Museum during the last years. His knowledge of antiquities was very extensive, and his extreme caution, making him reject everything even seemed to be false, undoubtedly kept the collection under his charge free from the many forgeries which abound, especially in Egypt, where falsifiers are legion. Dr. Birch, however, suspected everything to be false until it was absolutely proved to be true. In the latter part of December last he received notice that an antiquity connected with my own special department was for sale to the Museum, and he asked me to examine it, remarking (though he had not seen the objects) that they were probably forgeries. The fatal illness had already taken him when I was prepared to report upon the matter. On being told that the objects in question were forgeries, \"I thought so!\" he exclaimed, starting up\nhis pillow, \"just write and tell the owners that they are not suitable for acquisition by the British Museum.\" This is the line upon which he went, in all transactions with dealers, and he was thereby undoubtedly successful in keeping the collections under his charge in a high state of efficiency and trustworthiness.\n\nAlthough Dr. Birch never visited the sites which have yielded so plentifully the records of the ancient civilizations which was his favourite study, it would be hardly fair to cast this omission against him as a reproach; for though a voyage in Egypt would undoubtedly have given him some advantage in his studies, it was nevertheless not by any means indispensable. It was with deliberate intention, however, that he stayed at home. \"I prefer to stay here,\" he used to say, \"for I know that most of the things of importance will ultimately be brought here into my room. I always told Mr. Smith that he would die if he went to Assyria, and it really turned out as I predicted.\"\n\nOne of the chief events of his life was the founding, in conjunction with the late W. R. Cooper and others, of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, upon the ruins of the Syro-Egyptian Society. Of this new and very successful venture he was president from 1870, the date of its foundation, until his death. He was also President of the London Congress of Orientalists in 1874. For such posts as these he was certainly eminently fitted from the wide range of his learning and reading.\n\nTo his study of fortification and military science in early youth is probably to be attributed that deep interest in politics which was one of his most characteristic traits, and those who came into contact with him will doubtless remember his opinions upon the Russian and Chinese questions. Though professing to be a Liberal, he nevertheless decidedly favoured Conservative policy. He was very unfavourably impressed by the \"three acres and a\ncow\" idea, and jocularly asked, if his own poor two\nof an acre were to form part of some lucky peasant-h\nthree acres, when the idea came to be put into practice.\n\nIt has been asserted in one of the memoirs which\nbeen written, that Dr. Birch was only a pioneer, an\nhis life was a failure, because he founded no scl\nstudents who, following their master's footsteps, mi\nable to continue his work. His very numerous work\nthat his life was not a failure as far as solid w\nconcerned\u2014indeed, it may be regarded as a most triu\nsuccess; for the success or failure of a man's life do\ndepend upon the number of pupils he has trained.\nBirch has left behind none, who, being still you\nnevertheless advanced enough to take his place, it wa\ndeliberate intention on his part. \"What,\" he woul\n\"is the use of training a school of students of\nEgyptian or Assyrian?

He was subsequently sent home to Mill Hill School, and returning to the East, in 1838, rejoined his family at Macao. As a child he had acquired a knowledge of Dutch and Malay, as children do, without tears, and he had possibly been introduced to the study of Chinese. Dr. Medhurst, a man of remarkable aptitude, independently of his attainments as a student of the written language, had become a proficient in the dialect spoken by the natives of Fuh Kien, between which province and the island of Java and the Straits Settlements, thousands of Chinese had been long used to drift to and fro.\n\nAt Macao, at all events, the son was fairly entered, and under the guidance more especially of John Robert Morrison, the distinguished Chinese Secretary of the Superintendency of Trade, he became a competent speaker of the Mandarin, and withal a fair translator of official correspondence and the more difficult papers published in the *Peking Gazette*. In addition to this he learned to write a Chinese hand of singular excellence; a rare accomplishment, which stood him afterwards in good stead.\n\nIn those days the one spot in China accessible to the foreigner was Canton; Macao being regarded as an outlying dependency. Intercourse as well as trade was the monopoly of the Hong merchants. Chinese in any shape was studied more or less *sub ros\u00e2*, and the communication of the *Gazette* to the barbarian was a punishable irregularity. So short-handed in those days of anti-foreign jealousy was the native staff of the Chinese Secretariat, that the mere transcription and registration of correspondence was at times no easy matter. In 1839 occurred our first serious rupture with China, by which, of course, all difficulties of the kind\n\n\\(^1\\) Notice supplied by Sir Thomas Wade, K.C.B., M.R.A.S.\nwere much increased. The younger Medhurst's had already been recognized, and, in 1840, he was to a clerkship in the Chinese Secretariat, an following year was attached to the suite of Pottinger. He accompanied the combined force coast in 1841, and was present at the first capture and the second capture of Chusan, at which he was left as Interpreter to the Garrison until 1842. The Five Ports having been opened by signed at Nanking in September, Mr. Medhurst Interpreter to the Consulate of Shanghai, serving Sir George Balfour, and later under Sir Rutherford. In 1849, on the death of Mr. Gutzlaff, he succeeded gentleman as Chinese Secretary, and in 1853, i to the duties of his own post, he acted as Se the Superintendent of Trade. In 1854, he became at Foochow, and in 1858, when the Northern I opened by Lord Elgin's Treaty, he was named but he never took up his commission there. various acting appointments up to 1864, amo places at Shanghai, during the Gordon campai the Tai Ping insurgents.

As a linguist, he rather than brilliant; but very useful. It seld\nthe lot of any man to be able to do what Sir Walter Medhurst did in 1876, when, at the instance of his former chief, Sir Rutherford Alcock, he proceeded eastward once more in the interest of the Borneo Company. The object of his mission being to encourage Chinese immigration in the direction of the newly-formed settlement, the Company were so fortunate as to secure in Sir Walter Medhurst an agent perfectly possessing the three languages, Dutch, Malay, and Chinese, for the employment of which necessity would be found to exist at either end of the line of communication.\n\nMr. James Fergusson,\u00b9 C.I.E., D.C.L. Oxon., LL.D. Edin., F.R.S., F.G.S., Vice-President of this Society, a Past Vice-President of the Royal Institute of British Architects, a Member of the Council of the Royal Geographical Society, a Member of the Society of Dilettanti, and of other learned bodies, was born at Ayr in Scotland, on the 22nd of January, 1808. His father, Dr. William Fergusson, author of Notes and Recollections of a Professional Life, was a man of some mark, who had seen service in various parts of the world, having been present on the Flag ship at Copenhagen in 1801, principal medical officer at the taking of Oporto, in the passage of the Douro, and at Talavera; and who, after serving in the West Indies, went to live at Edinburgh in the year 1817. James, the younger of Dr. Fergusson's two sons, had consequently the opportunity of beginning his education at the High School of that city. He entered Mr. Irvine's first class there in 1818, and in the following year was in the second class. Dr. Fergusson, however, left Edinburgh in 1821, and at the invitation of H.R.H. the Duke of Gloucester, on whose staff he had acted in France, settled at Windsor, where he ultimately obtained a large and lucrative practice as a physician.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Notice supplied by Mr. William H. White, M.R.A.S., Secretary of the Roy. Instit. British Architects.\n\u00b2 See Dr. Fergusson's Notes and Recollections of a Professional Life, edited by James Fergusson. London, 1846, 8vo.\nwas then sent to a private school at Hounslow, and was destined for employment in the firm of Fairlie, Duff and Co., of Calcutta, with which his family had been connected, and in which his elder brother was a partner. His early education was neither academical nor classical; on the contrary, it was of a very ordinary character. However, he failed soon after James Fergusson's arrival, and he became an indigo planter. He also, in conjunction with his brother William, started an independent business in Calcutta, from which he appears to have made the first opportunity open to him. Commercial pursuits were not to his taste; he took from the very earliest period great delight in old buildings, particularly those of the Hindu type, and he was ultimately enabled to gratify his archaeological bent. His rare powers of philosophical thought, how acquired, it is now difficult to ascertain\u2014were displayed upon the architectural remains to be found in the localities he visited during lengthened tours over which seem to have occupied him from the years 1842, when he returned to England. His route through the length and breadth of the Peninsula, sometimes on horseback, sometimes in a palanquin, is given in a manner which forms one of the plates of his *Picturesque Illustrations of Ancient Architecture in Hindustan*, published in London prior to the appearance of that valuable work, he communicated to this Society, of which he was elected a member in 1840, some of the fruit of his earliest labours. At the close of 1843 he read a Paper, apparently the first ever presented to any learned body, on *The Rock-cut Temples of India* [Vol. VIII. pp. 30-92, art. 10, illustrated with ten plates], which, after the due presentation of a memorial by the Council of this Society to the Court of Directors of the East India Company, led to orders being sent to the presidencies, authorising the employment of competent persons to measure and draw the various antiquities remaining.\n\u2014a fact which led Fergusson to note, somewhat jubilantly, in a reprint of his Paper, that \"we may thus escape the hitherto too-well merited reproach of having so long possessed that noble country and done so little to illustrate its history or antiquities.\" Going out a second time, he was in Bombay in the spring of 1845, and this was the last visit he paid to the country with which his name, as the acknowledged historian of Indian and Eastern Architecture, and indeed of all architecture, must be ever identified. This too was a period of troubles and anxieties, augmented as they were in 1846 by the death of his father, whose memory he has preserved in the interesting work previously referred to.\n\nFergusson, when he founded the house of business before mentioned in partnership with his elder brother William, had always intended to leave it at the earliest opportunity, and he did so, returning home to build his house in Langham Place, and, having known the pleasures as well as the discomforts of a planter's life, to keep a very tolerable stable. But he committed the fatal mistake of leaving his name in the Calcutta house, and was therefore partly responsible for its debts and liabilities when the ultimate failure of the business was announced. He had, in conjunction with Mr. (now Sir) A. H. Layard, been the adviser of the Crystal Palace Company in the erection of the Assyrian House in the tropical end of the building (since destroyed by fire), and the author of the Handbook describing that structure; and at the juncture just alluded to he accepted the request of the Company to be their General Manager, a post which he entered early in 1856, and occupied till the middle of 1858. The practical details of the Handel Festival, which still exist with hardly a modification, were all settled by him, in reference to the first Festival in 1857. On leaving the Crystal Palace, he became Secretary to a Bengal Railway, an office which he relinquished after a short period of service.\n\nFergusson's second public contribution to the study of\nIndian architecture was made in 1848, in a Paper\nthe Institute of British Architects, on the Ancient\nArchitecture of India, which is the first article t\npen printed in the Transactions of that body. T\nfollowed, almost immediately, by the independent pu\nof a book, described by him at the close of his\nthe best he had ever written, and of which he th\nhad sold four copies, entitled, \"An Historical\ninto the True Principles of Beauty in Art, more\nwith reference to Architecture,\" etc. The preface\na reference to his earlier career, which possesses so\nif not historical interest. Offering excuses for the\nof his ambitious task, he says: \"In the first pl\nmen have, either from education or the professional\nof their life, been less prepared for such a work\nFrom boyhood I was destined to the desk. Fro\nI passed to the counting-house; from that to a\nfactory\u2014of all places in the world, perhaps, the o\nsuited for a cultivation of any knowledge of the fi\nfrom this to become an acting and active partner in\nmercantile establishment, from the trammels of w\nspite of every endeavour, I have never been able\nmyself; and during the time this work has been\nI have written, and, perhaps, also thought, more a\nstate of the money-market, indigo, sugar, silk an\nlike articles, than I have regarding architecture,\nor sculpture.

The whole edifice under who\nI have passed my life has been swept away, and t\nbeen nothing but ruin and misery around me.\"\nHe does not, however, omit to mention his obligations to the late Mr. Edwin Norris, an old Member of this Society, more especially for the ethnographical portions of his book, and for the assistance which Mr. Norris, from his extraordinary knowledge of languages, was enabled to render. Another quotation from the same preface will serve to illustrate the independence of spirit in which he approached his subject, and partly account, perhaps, for some of the animosities he afterwards encountered, particularly among archaeologists, while forcing his facts and theories\u2014his \"harsh and unfashionable doctrines,\" as he termed them\u2014into unwilling ears. He says: \"I have also had the good fortune to spend the best years of my life in countries where Art, though old and decrepit, still follows the same path that led it towards perfection in the days of its youth and vigour, and, though it may be effete, it is not insane. In the East, men still use their reason in speaking of art, and their common sense in carrying their views into effect. They do not, as in modern Europe, adopt strange hallucinations that can only lead to brilliant failures; and, in consequence, though we may feel inclined to despise results, they are perfection itself compared with what we do, when we take into account the relative physical and moral means of the Asiatic and the Anglo-Saxon. . . . A course of study pursued among the products of art themselves in this manner I have found far more instructive than books of theories are or perhaps ever can be; and I believe all would find it so if they could follow it in such circumstances as would prevent their being influenced by the errors of bad education, or free them from the trammels of the stereotyped opinions of the age. The belief that it has been so to me induces me now to publish the result of my experience. I believe I see the path which other and cleverer men have mistaken; and as the veriest cripple who progresses in the right direction will beat the strongest pedestrian who chooses a wrong path, I trust to being able to instruct even those\nbefore whose superior knowledge and abilities I would\nwise bow in silence.\"\n\nAt the end of the same preface he tells how he then put aside entirely the subject of that volume\nevery thought and every spare moment to the science\nfication, his head being wholly filled with \"walls of mounds of earth of the most murderous form a\nutilitarian ugliness.\" In 1849 he published his Propri\nSystem of Fortification, the main feature of which proposal of earthworks in place of masonry\u2014then\nunfashionable doctrine, though now universally\nHe further illustrated his ideas by printing a\nentitled The Perils of Portsmouth, or French Fa\nEnglish Forts, the third edition of which appeared\nwhereby he forcibly directed public attention to the d\ninsecurity of that great military and naval port; and\nfollowed in 1856 by a sequel entitled Portsmouth Prot\nwith Notes on Sebastopol and other Sieges during the\nWar. The reputation obtained from these works ear\nto be appointed a Member of the Royal Commissior\nDefences of the United Kingdom.\n\nHe contributed to the Transactions of the Ins\nBritish Architects papers of great value, namely, in\nThe History of the Pointed Arch; in 1850, on The Ar\nof Southern India; in 1851, on The Architecture of\nin 1854, on The Architectural Splendour of the City of\nand The Great Dome of Muhammad's Tomb, Bijapu\nfollowing year appeared his Illustrated Handbook of\ntecture, in two volumes, a work undertaken by him\nrequest of Mr. John Murray, and afterwards enlarged\nfour closely printed, profusely illustrated octavo volu\ntaining the History of Ancient and Medi\u00e6val Ar\n(2 vols.), the History of the Modern Styles of Ar\nture (1 vol.), and the History of Indian and\nArchitecture (1 vol.), the last one bearing the date\nand it may be added that of all the many volumes which bear Fergusson's name on the title-page these are perhaps the only works from which he derived any emolument, the majority of his writings having been brought out at his own cost for the edification of a necessarily small number of readers.\n\nAn important characteristic of Fergusson's labours lay in the courage with which he maintained the opinions he had once given to the world. All or most of his so-called theories were started early in life, and they were seldom if ever withdrawn as untenable, though capable, as he often admitted, of obvious modification. In his first great architectural effort, *The Principles of Beauty*, &c., published in 1848, he devoted a portion (pp. 385\u2013393) to the mode in which the ancient Greek Temples were lighted. It seemed to him, even then, absurd to suppose that while the Egyptians had been so long familiar with the \"clearstory,\" by which he translated the word \u1f40\u03c1\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd, the architects of ancient Greece should have remained in ignorance of it, and he contended that they were too artistic, either to shut out the light of day from their temples, as some thought, or to expose an ivory statue to the atmosphere even of Athens, as the text of Pausanias was interpreted to imply. He treated the same subject on a precisely similar basis at a meeting of the Institute of British Architects in 1861; and having prepared a large model of the Parthenon, complete, with its roof and \"clearstory,\" as he believed it originally existed, he wrote as late as 1883, *The Parthenon: an Essay on the mode by which light was introduced in Greek and Roman Temples*\u2014a subject of the utmost interest to architects and artists, as well as to archaeologists, but one which, during all the years that passed while he was writing about it, failed to elicit anything like enthusiasm either from theoretical critics or from practical men. On other ground further east Fergusson's perseverance was attended with more immediate success. In 1847 he published a work in large octavo form entitled *An Essay on the*\nAncient Topography of Jerusalem, grounded on the precise measurements of Catherwood, Arundale, and Bonomi, a singular chance had been employed by the Turks to seize the opportunity to make complete drawings of the edifice. In this remarkable essay he contended that the present Church of the Holy Sepulchre does not mark the true burial-place of our Saviour, but that the site of the Holy Sepulchre is the \"Dome of the Rock,\" where the \"Mosque of Omar\" now stands, which he believed, from the evidence of the architecture, was the identical Church erected by Constantine the Great over the tomb of our Saviour at Jerusalem. The work he used his own word, \"stillborn.\" But in 1860 an article appeared in the Edinburgh Review, on \"The Church of the Holy Land,\" and Fergusson replied to it, the following year, with a pamphlet entitled Notes on the Site of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem, in which he repeated his attention and concluded with expressing his belief that very short time it would be generally acknowledged that he was right. A storm of opposition to this theory thereby raised, but at the same time the idea of an accurate survey of the Holy City was induced by novel views he advocated, and carried out at the cost of Burdett Coutts by Capt. C. W. Wilson, R.E. At this time his personal influence was rapidly increasing, and he gained adherents. We have it on the authority of Sir Grove, his colleague at the Crystal Palace, his collaborator in the Dictionary of the Bible, and throughout his life friend and warm champion, that the Palestine Exploration Fund had its origin in a remark of Fergusson's addressed during the building of the Assyrian house in the Crystal Palace at Sydenham, in the year 1853\u2014a complaint that there was no exhaustive and accurate Concordance of the Names of the Bible. Nor did he confine himself to i\nHis purse was open for the prosecution of his favourite investigations, when he had confidence in the investigator. The first large map of the Haram Area at Jerusalem was drawn at his cost. In a letter to *The Times*, published on the 17th of January, 1886, about a week after Fergusson's death, Colonel Sir C. W. Wilson, R.E., wrote: \"It was Mr. Fergusson who enabled me to make those tentative excavations at Jerusalem in 1865, which led the way to the better known, and much more extensive excavations which were afterwards carried out by Sir Charles Warren for the Palestine Exploration Fund. In forwarding the necessary funds Mr. Fergusson, with characteristic fairness, wrote 'Dig wherever you like; you cannot dig anywhere without adding something to our knowledge of Jerusalem; and if you want more money, you can have it.' It is also no secret, I believe, that Mr. Fergusson was prepared to pay the cost of certain excavations in the Haram area, on the result of which he acknowledged his theories must stand or fall, and that the persistent refusal of the Sultan to allow excavations to be made in that area alone prevented him from putting his theories to practical test.\" His views on Jerusalem topography and on the Temple are given in a condensed form in two remarkable articles in the late Dr. William Smith's *Dictionary of the Bible*, vols. i. and ii.\n\nFergusson continued his inquiries into the subject with unabated persistency, and in 1878 published a work of more than three hundred quarto pages, fully illustrated with plates and woodcuts, on *The Temples of the Jews and the other buildings in the Haram Area at Jerusalem*, in which he maintained his original opinions in respect of the Mosque of Omar, as being the original church erected by Constantine, and developed them by learned and minute historical references.\n\nThe facts brought to light by the publication of the Marquis de V\u00f6gu\u00e9's book on *Syrie Centrale*, formed a subject of intense\ninterest to him, and through his influence the Royal Medal for Architecture, which has been given annually since 1848 by Her Majesty the Queen to some architect or scientist of any country, was offered to and accepted by the Marquis in 1879. Nor is it any secret that the recommendations for this honour, made by the Royal Institute of Architects in 1883 on behalf of Mr. Penrose, and in behalf of Dr. Schliemann, were brought about by Fergusson's earnest advocacy. Some years previously, in 1871, he received it himself for \"patient and zealous industrious power, as an architectural historian, and for the earnestness, ability, and truthfulness with which he had approached his task,\" the words used by the late Thomas H. Cole when, as President, he presented the Royal Medal to Fergusson.\n\nIn 1867 Fergusson described to this Society the Amravati Tope in Gantur, and illustrated his subject with the photographs and casts. This was the year of the Exposition Internationale at Paris, where, with the co-operation of the British Government, a large collection of photographs of Indian architecture, including the Tope, was being exhibited in the Indian Court, and the facts connected with the exhibition are so identified with Fergusson and his research, and are also so interesting, told as they are by himself, that they should find a place in his History. Having just completed the History of Architecture, enjoying, consequently, some leisure, he accepted, at the suggestion of the late Sir Henry Cole, the task of arranging a number of photographs of Indian architecture, for the Exhibition, and he proposed that some casts of a portion or some architectural fragments should be added, to enable students to judge of the merit of the objects from specimens of the work. But the necessity of making casts was obviated by the discovery that portions of a monument\u2014the Amravati Tope\u2014were then in...\nThese marbles had been excavated as far back as 1845, and sent to Madras, where they had lain exposed to wind and rain for some ten or twelve years. They had then been sent to England, and no room having been found for them in the India Museum, they were deposited at Fife House, in a disused coach-house, where Fergusson found them. The marbles were then photographed, the photographs were pieced together, and thereby two elevations of the outer Rail, and one of the inner Rail, of the Amravati Tope, were obtained. \"During the three or four months,\" to use his own words, \"which I had spent poring over these photographs, I had not only become familiar with their forms, but had acquired a considerable amount of unexpected knowledge of ancient Indian art and mythology\"\u2014the greater part of which, he afterwards adds, was quite new to him.\n\nThese marbles and photographs, and the Paper respecting them contributed to this Society, were the prelude to a work which was prepared by Fergusson under the authority of the Secretary of State for India in Council, and published by the India Office in 1868, namely, *Tree and Serpent Worship: or Illustrations of Mythology and Art in India, in the first and fourth centuries after Christ, from the Sculptures of the Buddhist Topes at Sanchi and Amravati*. Lord Iddesleigh, then Sir Stafford Northcote and in office, had entered warmly into Fergusson's views on this subject, and the Council had granted permission, and also the necessary funds, to publish all the information then possessed regarding the Amravati Tope; moreover Fergusson in the course of his investigations at the Library of the India Office had lighted on a beautiful series of drawings of the Sanchi Tope made in 1854, and at the same time there arrived from India a set of photographs of the same monument. The result was eminently gratifying to Fergusson, and a very valuable work, upon a subject which may ultimately obtain further elucidation, was thus placed at public disposal for a com-\nparatively small sum\u2014a work to which General Cunningham and others contributed important appendices.\n\nThe perplexed questions connected with megalithic structures next occupied Fergusson's attention, although the subject was not unfamiliar to him, seeing that he had written an article on Stonehenge, which appeared in July 1866 in the Quarterly Review, and another in the same Review in January 1870, which was entitled \"Non-Historic Times.\" His attention with regard to these singular and inexplicable structures was that they are by no means so old as antiquaries believe, and his Rude Stone Monuments in all Countries, Ages and Uses, treated of remains known to exist not only in Europe, but also in Asia and America.\n\nPrior to this, a new post had been created at the Office of Her Majesty's Works and Public Buildings, with the object of securing Fergusson's services there. In 1869, he was appointed by the then First Commissioner (Mr. A. H. Layard) \"Secretary of Works and Buildings,\" and the business he was expected to do was not to his taste. The Committee was consequently called together, consisting of Treasury officials and the late Mr. Austin, who submitted their Report that the First Commissioner required to be an officer conversant in a high degree with architecture, with reference to questions connected with existing or contemplated buildings, and on their advice Fergusson's new title was altered to \"Inspector of Public Buildings and Monuments.\" His recommendations, however, were not adopted in an important instance, namely, that of the recently-erected Courts of Justice, and he retired at the first opportunity which offered. The fact was much to be regretted for Fergusson's sake, but for the country's sake, and a Memorandum (11 March 1869) on the subject of the matter is in the highest degree instructive. In it Sir Henry Layard wrote that the office held by Fergusson was imperatively required for the public service, and the\nsuch an officer been connected with the Office of Works, many things which have brought discredit on the Department might have been avoided.\"\n\nFergusson was often consulted on architectural questions by authorities of various kinds, and buildings were erected from his designs, notably the picture gallery containing Miss North's wonderful paintings in Kew Gardens, in which he put into actual practice his life-long theory of the mode of lighting Greek temples. He was also an active member of the several committees engaged in the difficult task of completing St. Paul's Cathedral.\n\nBetween his first and second contribution to the Journal of this Society a gap of years intervenes. These contributions are:\n\nVol. VIII. (Original Series) Art. II.\u2014On the Rock-cut Temples of India, read 5th December, 1843, containing 10 plates.\n\nVol. III. (New Series) Art.

The result not being satisfactory to the latter, he urged the possibility of sending another expedition to these caves under European guidance, and offered to pay the expenses should the Government decline to bear them. This led to a controversy of somewhat acrimonious character; but the strength of Fergusson's convictions was often expressed by him with an almost unnecessary strength of language. He may, however, be largely excused on account of the character of many of the attacks with which he was assailed. Irritated and indignant, he published, perhaps unwisely, in 1884, a pamphlet entitled Archaeology in India, in which he wrote in the preface, he took an opportunity of saying a few last words on some points of that subject which his study had rendered clearer to him than they were to others, and Dr. Rajendralal Mitra's works became a convenient peg on which to hang his observations. But in such positions, especially upon Indian matters, even his opponents were his debtors. Fergusson, by his individual efforts, needed a jot of encouragement from the Government, with no criteria which could enable him to form a judgment on the age or style of the buildings he was studying, to lay them, and laid the solid foundations of an arch\u00e6ological chronology for Hindustan. Undoubtedly some of the most remarkable edifices of that country had been visited and partially described, both by the illustrious Mr. Bernier and by other travellers, French and English, of the seventeenth century, as well as by later writers, among whom Heber may be prominently mentioned, although these edifices had been even drawn, though imperfectly, by...\nand others. But until Fergusson began to systematize the result of his laborious examinations and to publish his studies of the historical monuments in stone and marble scattered over the face of India, the mass of these and their mutual affinities were like a sealed book to the learning and intelligence of the world. It is not too much to assert that the present votaries of Indian research owe to him the means of checking historical tradition by easy reference to the substantial records with which, principally through his works, they are now familiar.\n\nIt would not be right to terminate a memoir written for this Society without mentioning the Paper which Fergusson contributed to the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, for August 1863, on \"Recent Changes in the Delta of the Ganges.\" He had resided as a planter for five years on the banks of one of the most active of the Bengal rivers, and had been a witness of some of the changes he described. When, as he states, he first became aware of the disturbance that was taking place around him, he set himself to measure and observe what was passing, and in 1835 made a sketch survey of the Lower Ganges and Brahmaputra from Jaffergunge to the sea. This was published soon afterwards, and his Paper read to the Geological Society was illustrated with a map of the rivers of Bengal showing the changes since Rennell's survey. Such wide versatility of genius was all the more remarkable from the fact that his views on subjects of the most varied nature requiring study and ability of the most distinct character, and information from sources totally opposed to and distant from each other, were neither superficial nor cursory, but on the contrary were carefully thought out and illustrated generally with direct evidence of skill and learning. Besides those enumerated, he has written articles for periodicals, and letters without end which have been published in the newspapers, and his last contribution of this kind appeared in the Nineteenth Century,\nfor November 1885, on \"The Restoration of We Hall.\" Seized the following month with a second of paralysis, he died on the 9th of January, 188 seventy-eighth year of his age.\n\n\"Those,\" says an old and intimate associate, \"knew Fergusson in a business or an official capacity, came into contact with his rough exterior alone, little idea of what a very affectionate and even tender there was to his character. To those whom he loved devoted, and the number was greater than many would As a son and a brother few equalled him in unwearied and thoughtful attention; and besides relatives, many friends of all classes who would gladly testify things were not too sacred for open testimony\u2014to the of his friendship, the firm attachment with which inspired them during a long intercourse of unvarying ness, and their deep sorrow at his death.\"\n\nMr. Edward Thomas,\u00b9 C.I.E., F.R.S., the learned matist and Indian Antiquary, who had been for nearly years a Member, and for twenty-five years, Treasurer of the Royal Asiatic Society, died on Wednesday, February, at his house, in Victoria Road, Kentish Town, after an illness of some weeks' duration. Having through the prescribed ordeal of study at Haileybury, out in 1832 to India, in the service of the Hon. East India Company, as a writer on the Bengal establishment, to continued ill-health, which necessitated change of scene, his career in the East was more than once interrupted by absence on medical certificate, and his abilities and fitness had not the same opportunity for display as other circumstances have been offered. Consequent notwithstanding his many claims to distinction and pecuniary he retired on his civil service annuity in 1857,\n\n\u00b9 The greater part of this memoir, and list of writings which appear (by Mr. Stanley Lane Poole, M.R.A.S.), have already appeared in the\nhimself thenceforward to those literary and scientific pursuits which had, to a great extent, been the charm if not the recognized business of his life. A constant attendant at the meetings of societies, he wrote a long series of essays and articles on many branches of Indian and old Persian Archaeology.\n\nThe services he rendered to science by breaking ground in a dozen obscure subjects\u2014such as Bactrian, Sassanian, and Indo-Scythic coins, Indian metrology, Sassanian gems and inscriptions\u2014are admittedly very great. Ever eager to turn his researches to practical account, he would sometimes hasten fearlessly to express his views, even in an embryo state, upon a new discovery, or to explain the bearings of a new point that had struck him in his constant and patient study of Indian antiquities. Indeed, it would not have been difficult to trace the gradual progress into shape of the new thought in a series of amended proof-sheets. But this promptness in publishing fresh data served as a stimulating impulse to other students, and it would be hard to say how many branches of study previously unexplored Mr. Thomas set on foot by one or other of his suggestive papers in the transactions of learned societies. He had the genius of the archaeologist for detecting analogies and relations, and he was a palaeographer of a very high order. He made many mistakes\u2014as scholars must do if they prefer premature hatching to prolonged incubation\u2014but he also advanced every study he took up, and gave it a fresh impetus, and often a new and accurate direction.\n\nLike De Quincey's, Mr. Thomas's works were mainly contributed to periodicals; but instead of Blackwood or Tait's, he wrote for such learned journals as those of the Royal Asiatic Society and the Asiatic Society of Bengal, as the Numismatic Chronicle and the Indian Antiquary. Many of his papers were afterwards collected in book form, and one such collection is his well-known \"Chronicles of the Pathan Kings of Delhi\" (1847), which went to a second and greatly\nenlarged edition in 1871, and will always remain a work for Indian numismatists. Another important taking was his edition of James Prinsep's \"Essays on Antiquities,\" with the \"Useful Tables,\" 2 vols., 185 he enriched with many valuable notes, and rendered its want of order, an indispensable work of rearchaeologists. His last great enterprise was the what was intended to form a cyclop\u00e6dia of Easter matics\u2014the \"International Numismata Oriental which nine parts, mainly written by leading authori appeared between 1874 and 1885, and many more l arranged for. Besides his constant literary activity an energetic member of various learned societies, proceedings he took a lively interest. The Roya Society loses in him an excellent Treasurer and an i Member of Council; and has recorded its deep ap of its loss in a special minute. Those who attend the meetings at Albemarle Street will miss the famili that regularly abandoned the temptations of the A Club to attend the Council of the Asiatic. Other owed much to Mr. Thomas's energy and experien his quick temper, intolerant of opposition (as be Indian official of the old school), gave him an alm cratic authority on subjects which he had made No man has done more by personal influence, as w his writings, to encourage the study of Oriental antic England. His conclusions may sometimes be error theories\u2014say, of primitive Indian coinage and me fanciful, and his mode of expression peculiar; but services to archaeology have been many and varied one can dispense with his guidance in the numerous research which he has opened to exploration. Th Society recognized his work by electing him a Fe French Institute made him a Correspondent, and tl decorated him with the Order of the Indian Empire.\nThe following is a chronological list (with abbreviated titles) of the chief writings of the deceased:\n\n1846.

On the 27th month the grave closed on one whose life-long service in England's distant empire merits a brief notice.\n\nWilliam Ross Robinson entered the Madras Civil Service in 1842, having passed the two previous years at Haileybury College. On first arrival he had, as usual, to acquire knowledge of the local languages, and was then employed by the Revenue Department in various districts. Limited opportunities of displaying marked ability necessitated subordinate positions, but soon evinced the quality distinguishing him to the last\u2014untiring zeal and industry, independence of thought, and fearlessness in\nand doing what he believed to be right, and the entire subordination of every personal consideration to the performance of duty. His was never the perfunctory discharge of official business during \"office hours,\" his whole time and every thought were given to his work: the pleasures of society, and even the comforts of home life, were sacrificed without hesitation whenever duty required. By general consent no one was more thoroughly conversant than he with the character and disposition of the people and their peculiar land tenures and customs, and this knowledge was turned to good account in after years when he rose to positions of influence and authority.\n\nIt is impossible here to follow him throughout his lengthened career, embracing service in every district of his presidency, and also in Calicut, where he took a prominent part in the framing of various legislative enactments and police measures. One or two instances of special work may, however, be noted. As quite a young civilian he was sent by the Madras Government to the Laccadive Islands, where famine and \"a scourge of scurvy\" were rife, to supply the inhabitants with food and medicine. Accompanied by a few native officials, he left Calicut for the scene of his labours, and remained at his post for some months, the only European in that comparatively strange locality. His comprehensive description of the islands form the subject of an instructive and interesting article in the Madras Journal of Literature and Science for the second half of 1847. It was on the occasion of one of his visits there that a ship, through stress of weather, was driven ashore, and that his gallant and official services in helping to save the crew and\n\n---\n\n1 The following incident will show the energy Mr. Robinson brought to bear upon his work in India from his first arrival in the country. Very shortly after he joined his first appointment as assistant to the Collector of Canara, the civil engineer in his circuit visited Mangalore, when an improvement of its harbour was suggested; but nothing could be done because there was no one of the Public Works Department available to make the necessary surveys. Before the engineer's next visit, however, the young Assistant-Collector had taught himself surveying, and prepared a map of the harbour with its soundings ready for his use.\ncargo earned him the award of salvage money.\n\nHe was at a later period employed in the Malabar coast, and earned marked distinction during the troubles when Moplah fanaticism culminated in the murder of the magistrate, Mr. Conolly (1855).\n\nBut the crowning work of his career was unquestionably the organization of the police of the Madras Presidency. The condition of that force had long been a cause of deep anxiety to the Government; its inefficiency was shown by the prevalence of crime undetected and unrepressed, and a general belief in the venality and oppression of its native officers was extensively current. The reform of this important branch of the administration was entrusted, in 1858, to Mr. Robinson, and, undeterred by the magnitude and difficulty of the task, he undertook it single-handed, and so well performed it that when, in the ordinary course of the service, officers in his standing have been entitled to promotion and emoluments in other departments, his Government gave special sanction for such an increase to his allowances as would enable them to retain his services when they were so valuable to the State, without subjecting him to personal loss. It is difficult to exaggerate the magnitude of the work. His scheme was not composed in the quietude of study, or on the mere reports and suggestions of others; to the contrary, he visited every district of the Presidency, seeing for himself, and conferring with the local magistrates and others, submitted to his Government a plan of organization for each district complete in every respect, in accordance with the general principles previously laid down by the Government and approved by them. His plans provided for every detail of police administration, and included also the readjustment of the existing territorial divisions in order to provide a better relation of the force to the magistracy, the relief by the numerous small detachments of military\nabout the country, guarding treasuries and jails to the prejudice of military discipline, the framing of police regulations and laws, and other important matters. The mental and physical strain was indeed great, and he had also formidable difficulties to contend with, in the inert hostility of native officials of the old school, and especially in the submissive character of the people, affording no extraneous check to malpractices or oppression by the police. The force was at first entirely officered from the army, and the invidious task of selecting officers was, by universal consent, discharged by Mr. Robinson with the most absolute disregard of every consideration save that of fitness for the duty.\n\nIn 1866 Sir William was selected to be one of the first recipients of the honour of the Companionship of the Star of India. The following year he left the police force, which he had not only instituted but personally governed with admitted success, leaving to his successors a comparatively facile task. Experience has now proved the soundness of the principles he adopted; and the police administration of the Madras Presidency remains the enduring monument of his official career.\n\nIn 1869 Mr. Robinson was made a member of the Revenue Board and Inam Commissioner, and in 1873 a Member of Council of the Madras Government; and on the death of Lord Hobart in May, 1875, he became acting Governor, which post he held for seven months, and until the arrival of His Grace the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos. On the 31st December he was raised to the dignity of a Knight of the Star of India. Of his work in these last years of his Indian service it is enough here to say that, like all his work, it was characterized by unceasing energy and diligence.\n\nSir W. Robinson retired from the service on the 5th December, 1878, and finding no means of further serving his country and the land in which he had spent a lifetime, betook\nhimself to the work of charity, becoming an active member of several societies, and\n\n\"Life's race well run,\nLife's work well done,\nLife's crown well won,\"\n\nhe passed to his rest on the 27th April last. The assembled round his grave afforded silent testimony worth. Friends who had known him and his work days gone by, and friends who had only known him learned to value him, since his withdrawal from the of his life-long labours, now gathered round it, paying last tribute of love and esteem.\n\nWe gather from *The Nation* that Professor Dr. Seyffarth, the learned German archaeologist, died in York on the 17th of November last, in his eighty-ninth year. Born in Saxony and educated in Leipsic, he was a Professor of Archaeology in the latter place at the age of thirty-five. He turned his attention to Egyptian studies, and with Champollion the authorship of the now accepted system of hieroglyphics. In 1855 he came to the United States, where he was for six years a Professor in the Lutheran Seminary at St. Louis. In 1857 he published in this city a 'Summary of Recent Discoveries in Biblical Chronology, Universal History, and Egyptian Archaeology,' in English and German, and was a constant contributor to European and American periodicals.\n\nDr. Seyffarth had been on the List of Foreign Members of the Royal Asiatic Society since 1829, or for 57 years. In 1834 presented its Library with a copy of the *Beitr\u00e4ge zur Kenntniss der Literatur, Kunst, Mythologie und Geschichte des Altertums von \u00c4gypten*, published at Leipsic in the previous year.\n\nHis long residence on the other side of the Atlantic brought him, as it were, from European literary circles; but the news of his recent death brings to remembrance the fact that the work done by him was in a wide field, and remains of benefit to students in all quarters of the world.\nMr. Henry Louis St. Barbe, killed by dacoits in February of the current year, was a distinguished member of the Bengal Civil Service, which he joined in 1872. Removed to Burma within six months after his arrival in India, he filled several offices of importance in that country, and in 1879 was placed in charge of the Residency at Mandalay. His withdrawal from that station in October of that year was effected under stringent orders, and he afterwards became Assistant Agent to the Governor-General in Central India. In 1882, he returned from a two years' furlough to Europe, and in the following year his services were again utilized for the government of our possessions in the Far East. He was placed at the disposal of the Home Department, and appointed Deputy Commissioner of the fourth grade in British Burma, and posted to Bassein. It appears that while following dacoits in a steamer with a small force, he landed to reconnoitre, attended only by an orderly and guide. All three were shot: the bodies were removed by the captain of the steamer, who was wounded on the occasion. Mr. St. Barbe's death was not only a cause of deep sorrow to friends and relatives, but a heavy loss also to the Government he served with so much zeal and ability. As an Asiatic scholar, he may be mentioned as having passed examinations in Sh\u00e1n, Burmese, and Pali. He had been for about eight years a member of the Royal Asiatic Society, and contributed an article to the 10th Volume of the Journal under the heading of Burmese Transliteration.\n\nIn addition to the above, whose obituary notices may fairly demand admission in the Annual Report, as of members immediately forwarding the objects of this Society, there are recently deceased members who, from personal associations, or a certain position in the outer world, reasonably claim a passing mention, however brief.\n\nOf the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Trarancore (R\u00e1ma Varm\u00e1, brother of Vanchi B\u00e1la R\u00e1ma Varm\u00e1), the Calcutta correspondent of the Times, in notifying his death in August, 1885, thus\nwrites:\u2014\"It is not too much to say that this event is only less grave to the Indian Empire than to the State which he governed. Since he ascended the throne years ago, the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 has been known as the enlightened and the most learned of native princes. He wrote and spoke English with ease, was well versed in several Indian vernacular languages, and was an accomplished Sanskrit scholar. He had travelled over a great part of India, and wherever he went he made himself thoroughly well acquainted with everything worthy of notice. In his youth he had the advantage of training under Sir Siva Rao, the ablest of modern Native statesmen, who was the first man to start Travancore on that path of reform which it has followed with so much success. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 was a firm friend of the British Government, and during his rule Travancore continued to advance in prosperity, and well deserved the epithet often applied to it\u2014the most prosperous native State of India.\n\nOn the 28th July, 1885, the Society lost in Sir Moses Montefiore, Bart., F.R.S., a Member of 30 years' standing, who had completed his hundredth year in the previous November. In early life he became a member of the London Exchange, and shortly amassed a large fortune. It was, however, his ambition to become a millionaire, and he retired from business in 1825.\n\nIn 1827 Mr. Montefiore and his wife paid their first visit to the Holy Land, and on their way thither acquired the friendship of Muhammad 'Ali. They were cordially received at Jerusalem both by Jews and Gentiles, and spent some time there in prosecuting inquiries of interest. Sir Moses visited Palestine on six subsequent occasions. These visits were used as opportunities for the distribution of relief,\n\n---\n\n1 Abridged from an original memoir kindly supplied by F. D. Maurice, M.R.A.S.\nprovement or establishment of works of education, sanitation and industry. In 1840 the blood accusations at Damascus, which occasioned the imprisonment of Jews and threatened them with horrible tortures, took Sir Moses, in company with M. Cr\u00e9mieux, to Alexandria and Constantinople. He obtained from Muhammad 'Ali the order for the release of the prisoners, and from the Sultan not only a firman entirely exculpating the Jews from the offences with which they were charged, but one of general toleration for them throughout the whole of the Turkish Empire. In 1863, he obtained a confirmation of this firman by the new Sultan Abdul 'Aziz, and in 1864, when in his 80th year, his present influence at Morocco gained for him a similar favour from the Sultan Sidi Muhammad for Jews in the Moorish States. Two journeys to Russia, where he was well received by the Emperors Nicholas and Alexander respectively, and one journey to Bucharest in the same cause, should also be here noted.\n\nHis final journey was his seventh visit to the Holy Land at the age of 90, in 1874. The last ten years of his life were passed in retirement at East Cliff Lodge near Ramsgate. He was, to the end, active in mind, and full of the projects to which he had devoted his life. He still directed an enormous correspondence, which flowed to him from all countries and in all languages, and still contributed largely to a number of benevolent enterprises, entirely ignoring diversities of creed or race. His appearance was dignified and commanding and, in old age, venerable in the extreme, with a charm of manner which was equally extended to poor and rich, to young and old. Chosen Sheriff of London and Middlesex in 1837, he was knighted in the same year; and about nine years later he received a Baronetcy from Her Majesty.\n\nThough wanting, in early life, the advantages of a very finished education, and never laying claim to scientific attain-\nments, the tastes and interests of Sir Moses were so that he belonged to most of the learned societies of I Of the Royal Society, in whose proceedings he alwa much interest, he was elected a Fellow so far back 1836. His frequent journeys to the East, his eff the welfare of the Holy Land, and his intimate with many Oriental rulers and persons, may be c also to have given Sir Moses Montefiore a fiti among the Members of the Royal Asiatic Society, ever regard his memory with affection and respect.\n\nMr. Francis Mathew, M.I.C.E., who died on t September, 1885, was, when in India, Chief Engine more recently in England, Consulting Engineer, Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway Compa was a nephew of the celebrated Father Mathew.\n\nThe funeral in Westminster Abbey, on the 9th A of the Right Hon. W. E. Forster, bore plain testimon high esteen in which he was held by a very large of official and public men irrespective of party. Alh memory of the deceased statesman was not directly a with Asiatic literature, travel or research, yet hi for India and the welfare of its people amply the special mention of his name in the Obituar of this Society. The busy character of his parli life readily explains his rare attendance at its meeti it must not be forgotten that for 24 years he of its Resident Members. His personal history l told elsewhere. It is that of a patriotic English distinguished and honourable career sheds lustre country to which he belonged.\n\nAmong those Orientalists, not Members of the who have died since the date of the last Annual or between July 1885 and July 1886, may be n Pandit Tara Nath Turakachaspati, for 30 years a of Sanskrit in the college at Ban\u00e1ras: M. Brosset, ar\nGeorgian and Armenian scholar, in whose memory a monument has been erected at Tiflis; and the Hebrew scholar, Dr. Kalisch, the two last on the 22nd and 23rd August respectively. A Baptist Missionary, Dr. Nathan Brown, who died during the same year in Japan, had worked for 20 years in India, publishing there, in 1848, his Grammatical Notes of the Assamese Language, and in 1849 a translation of the New Testament into Assamese. On the 16th January 1886, His Excellency Subhi Pasha, a liberal patron of literature and science, died at Constantinople. He was the possessor of an Oriental Library of exceptional value. Dr. Jens Peter Broch, Professor of Semitic Languages in the University of Christiania for a quarter of a century\u2014said to have published the only book in the Arabic character ever printed in Norway\u2014died on the 15th March; and on the 17th idem, in his 92nd year, Leopold Zunz, the distinguished Talmudic scholar. To the above should be added, on the 27th April, Tobias Theodores, Professor of Oriental Languages at Owens College, Manchester, a scholar said to have been well acquainted with Hebrew, Syriac, and Arabic, as well as Latin and Greek, and six modern European languages. Born at Posen in 1808, he came to England when a very young man, and engaged in commercial pursuits.\n\nThe Auditors submit the accompanying Account of the Receipts and Expenditure of the Society, which will, they hope, be considered satisfactory.\n### ABSTRACT OF RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURE FOR THE YEAR 1885.\n\n| Date | Receipts | Expenditure |\n|------|----------|-------------|\n| Dec. 31, 1884 | Balance at Banker's, January 1, 1885 | \u00a31,465 19 0 |\n| | 1st Resident Members | \u00a310 10 0 |\n| | 2nd Resident Members | \u00a310 10 0 |\n| | 3rd Resident Members | \u00a310 10 0 |\n| | Annual Subscription | \u00a310 10 0 |\n| | Compositions (for Resident Members) | \u00a310 10 0 |\n| | Dividends from the India Office | \u00a310 10 0 |\n| | Sale of Philanthropist | \u00a310 10 0 |\n| | Total Receipts | \u00a31,465 19 0 |\n| | Investment | \u00a310 10 0 |\n| | Total Expenditure | \u00a31,465 19 0 |\n| | Balance at Bank, Dec. 31 | \u00a31,465 19 0 |\n\nTotal Receipts: \u00a31,465 19 0\n\nTotal Expenditure: \u00a31,465 19 0\n\nBalance at Bank, Dec. 31: \u00a31,465 19 0\nProceedings of Asiatic Societies.\u2014Royal Asiatic Society.\u2014The following papers have been read at different meetings of the Society, since the last Anniversary of May 18:\n\n1.

By J. W. Redhouse, M.R.A.S., Litt.D., C.M.G., etc., etc.\n\nFour numbers of part 1, vol. liv. of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (1885), contain much interesting matter. In No. 1, Mr. Atkinson continues his learned \u201cNotes on the History of Religion in the Himalaya of the N.W. Provinces,\u201d confining his remarks almost wholly to the funeral ceremonies, which are well worthy of study as illustrative of the character of the people by whom they are practised. The last service for the dying\u2014preparation of the body for the pyre-office for cremation\u2014procedure after cremation, with the ceremonies belonging to each of twelve days, are all curious details. Mr. G. A. Grierson and \u0160r\u00ed N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Singh edit and translate \u201cThe Battle of Kanarp\u00ed Gh\u00e2t, a poem, perhaps the most popular of its kind in Tirhut,\u201d written by a Maithil Brahman at the end of the last century, in the Baisw\u00e2r\u00ee dialect; and this is followed by Mr. Grierson single-handed, who, with his usual skill and industry, prepares for his reader the Bhojpur\u00ee and Magahi versions of the song.\nof Gopi Chand, and appends an English translation. C. J. Rodgers supplies information on some copper Akbar, on coins of Ranjit Deo, Rajah of Jammu, in the last century, and on coins of Ahmad Shah Abdali. Last give valuable testimony to historical data.\n\nIn No. 2 Mr. J. Boxwell, B.A., of the Bengal Civil Service, in his paper on the Trishtuhi Metre, introduces some Latin renderings of Sanskrit verse.\n\nOf the Proceedings of the Bengal Asiatic Society, Vol. 10 (1885) contain notices and discussions in the departments of Numismatics, Meteorology, and History. The greater part of the papers alluded to, however, been published in extenso in the Journal, and not be here considered. At the monthly general meeting on the 1st July, the President, Dr. Rajendralal Mitra, exhibited five Sanskrit MSS. treating of Veterinary Art, and gave an interesting analysis of them. The subject had not been hitherto noticed by any European Orientalist, a circumstance due to the neglect it has experienced at the hands of modern Pandits, to whom the characteristic diseases of horses offered no attraction. In ancient times it had been otherwise. Brahmins and scholars were physicians and ministers, and the horse was looked upon as an important element of a kingdom.\" Tracing back the history of Veterinary art in India to a period before the Greeks had separated into Greeks and Hindus, Dr. Mitra pointed out that eventually it became split into two parts, one relating to cattle, and one to horses only. Of the former the most noted Professor was P\u00e1lak\u00e1pya; of the latter the earliest professor was S\u00e1lihotra whose name appeared in the Hindi manuscript he had found, the name of the work being Chetana. Other works noticed were those of Vaidya of Dipajikara, son of M\u00e1nakara, and of Jayadatta and Vijayadatta. In the same number of the Proceeding (7) as that containing an account of these treatises.\nrelated \"a Coincidence in Folk Lore\" by the Rev. Charles Swynnerton. The writer finds in the *liber facetiarum* of the 15th-century ecclesiastic, Poggio Bracciolini of Florence, the Italian counterpart of a folk-tale of the Upper Panjab which he had himself told in a recently published volume. It is the story of a husband moving up the current of a river to seek the body of his drowned wife, on the principle that she always, during life, took an opposite course to every other person. Such coincidences are certainly not rare; and Mr. Swynnerton is perhaps fully justified in arguing that the fables \"trace their original source to some common tribe or family of men, whether in Central Asia or elsewhere, whose descendants, extending themselves east and west over the world, carried their household words with them.\" The Annual Report of the Society for 1884 shows the total number of Members at the close of the year to be 326, of whom 102 are Resident, 157 Non-Resident, 12 Foreign, 15 Life, and 40 Non-Subscribing Members. A six years' average makes the total 336, of whom 282 are paying, and 54 non-paying.\n\nMention of the *Centenary Review of the Asiatic Society of Bengal* will be here appropriate. This goodly volume, which embraces the hundred years from 1784 to 1883 inclusive, is in three Parts, with an Appendix in the shape of Proceedings of the Special Century Meeting held on the 15th January, 1884. Part I. is the History of the Society by Dr. Rajendralala Mitra, elected President in 1885. The learned native gentleman, in concluding his careful record, thus summarizes the great services rendered by the Society:\n\n1. It has provided for the use of scholars a commodious house valued at 150,000 Rupees.\n2. It has got up a library containing 30,000 volumes, of which upwards of 8000 are manuscripts.\n3. It has obtained a collection of ancient coins and medals valued at 10,000 Rupees.\n\n4. It has collected a small but valuable gallery of pictures and memorial busts.\n\n5. It has created an Archaeological and Ethnological Museum of considerable extent, a Geological Museum rich in Meteorites and Indian fossils, and a Zoological Museum all but complete as regards the Avi-fauna of India.\n\n6. It has published a total of 354 vols., including 21 vols. of the Asiatic Researches and Index, 84 vols. of the Journal and Index, 19 vols. of Proceedings, 167 vols. of Oriental works of different kinds, 31 vols. of miscellaneous works relating to India, 14 vols. of catalogues, and 18 vols. of Notices of Sanskrit Manuscripts.\n\nHis concluding words may be quoted as expressing an accepted fact: \"These are deeds which, for extent, variety and usefulness, may well claim the consideration of the public. They compare very favourably with the works of other and older Societies in other parts of the earth. To the student of science in India they have proved of invaluable service. And it is in view of these the Society this day celebrates its Centenary Jubilee.\"\n\nPart II. treats of Archaeology, History, Language and Literature; and is the work of Dr. A. F. Rudolf Hoernle, the Philological Secretary. It has full and interesting Appendices. Part III. is devoted to Natural Science, and is by Mr. P. N. Bose. Appended to it is a Classified Index to the Scientific papers in the Society's Publications from 1788 to 1882.\n\nAmong the six Special Centenary Honorary Members lately created are three highly-esteemed Members of the London Society, Professor A. H. Sayce, M. S\u00e9nart, and Professor Sir Monier Monier-Williams.\n\nIn connection with the Bengal Asiatic Society may be mentioned the numerous fasciculi of the Bibliotheca Indica\nwhich have been added to our library during the current year (1886).

Journey to the summit of Gunong Bubu, by the Rev. J. E. Tenison Woods.\n2. Continuation of a former paper on the Religions of the Sea Dyaks of Sarawak, by the Rev. J. Perham.\n3. The History of Perak from Native Sources, by the Hon. W. E. Maxwell.\n4. British North Borneo, by E. P. Gueritz, Esq.\n5. Jelebu, by H. A. O\u2019Brien, Esq.\n\nThese, however unpretending in themselves, all supply more or less valuable data for larger works on the history, politics, people, or geography of the places mentioned.\n\nOf the nine principal articles in the June number (1885), four are translations, one is an extract from the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, and four are original contributions. All these last have geographical interest, especially the Journey from Ku\u00e2la Bernam (Straits of Malacca) to Ku\u00e2la P\u00e2hang (Chinese Seas): but the French Missionary\u2019s Journey from Bangkok to \u00dabon will attract the archaeologist also in its account of a ruined city. \u201cPuthai-saman,\u201d the explorer writes, \u201cwas an important town\u2014or perhaps rather an imposing temple erected to the worship of Buddha. It is one of those monuments of Cambodia which are so much renowned and which astonish all travellers by their original and beautiful architecture.\u201d The \u201cNotes and Queries\u201d issued with this number (15) of the Journal, are full of interesting local matter, bearing on history, language, law, folk-lore, social customs, games, etc. Though Penang and Perak may have\nthe lion's share, the scene is not limited to these loci; Malacca, Singapore, and even Borneo are included.\n\nNorth China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society\nSeries, vol. xviii. contains the following Articles:\u2014\n\nI.

Librarian addressed a printed circular from Shanghai to the several Societies with which the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society was in correspondence, stating that their Journal would henceforth be published in short instalments, instead of, as formerly, in annual volumes. Since that date the Royal Asiatic Society has received six numbers of the new publication (vol. xx. parts i. to vi. inclusive) of which the contents are now summarised:\n\nThe Hung Lou M\u00e9ng, or Dream of the Red Chamber, by Herbert Giles, President. On the Prevalence of Infanticide in China; a question discussed in writing and orally by selected and special authorities. The Mystery of Ta-Tsin, by G. M. H. Playfair. Chapter iv. of the Ching-Hua-Yuan, translated by C. B. T. What is Filial Piety? discussed by several writers. Is China a Conservative country? Anon. Sinology in Italy, by M. Nocentini. Western Appliances in the Chinese Printing Industry, by Mr. Hirth. Chinese Theatricals and Theatrical Plots, by several writers. The Seaports of India and Ceylon, by G. Phillips. Some additions to my Chinese Grammar, by G. von den Gabelentz; and an instructive article on Bibliography, giving a list of books and papers in China published since 1st January, 1884, compiled by Mr. Hirth. There are also to be found Proceedings, List of Members, and interesting Notes and Queries. Among the last, referring to the word Brangoye used in the chronicles of Bar Hebraeus, Dr. Edkins says, \"We can hardly doubt that it is the Persian word Farang applied after the Muhammadan conquests to Western nations generally.\" An extract from Sonnerat in Col. Yule's \"Glossary of Indian Terms\" (p. 269) gives almost the word itself: \"Ainsi un Europ\u00e9en est tout ce quo les Indiens connaissent de plus m\u00e9prisable; ils le nomment Parangu\u00ef...\" But there can be no possible question on the identity of the words.\n1866.] ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY.\n\nJournal Asiatique, Serie viii. tome v.

Eutig and our countryman Mr. Doughty.\n\nIn vol. vi. No. 2, for August, September, and October, 1885, are:\u20141. A contribution by M. Masp\u00e9ro, Sur une Version Arabe du Conte de Rhampsinite. 2.

Ludwig's interpretation of the chronology of the Rig Veda, and M. L. Feer remarks\n\n---\n\n1 Of Huber's melancholy fate the following particulars recall the tragedy of the three Englishmen enacted only two years before, beside the Egyptian frontier, some five hundred miles nearer Europe:\n\nOn the night of the 26th July, 1884, he quitted Jedda to return to Haib, his head-quarters, where he had left the greater part of his luggage and collections. His intention was to explore Sadous, a distance of eight days' march to the S.S.E. of Haib, having learnt that some important ruins and inscriptions were to be seen there. Two days later he fell assassinated at Kassai Alia, almost at the very gates of Jedda. He had been accompanied from that town by his servant, Mahmud, and two guides. Mahmud had followed the road in charge of the baggage, while Huber and the guides had separated themselves to the right and left, in search of monuments and inscriptions. It had been agreed that all were to meet again at a certain halting-place, at which they were to take rest and refreshment. On the 29th, when Mahmud reached the appointed rendezvous, he saw Huber lying on the ground covered up in his Arab cloak, apparently asleep, and a little way off his guides engaged in prayer. He was about to unload the camels when he felt the muzzles of two barrels placed upon his breast, and heard one of the guides say, \"Throw away your arms, or we shall treat you as we did your master.\" Mahmud then observed for the first time that Huber was lying on the left side, and that the right side of his head was covered with blood, but that the body was in repose. He had been killed in his sleep by a pistol shot. Mahmud, after being kept prisoner for two days, managed to escape the assassins, and relate the story of his master's death to the French vice-consulate.

Sanction has been given for repairs t Usman's mosque and tomb at Ahmadabad. Major made long journeys, visiting most interesting ruins an ments. He adds to his report certain weighty rema the value of Indian Archaeology apart from its influc the elucidation of the early history of the country.\n\nFour volumes of the Archaeological Survey of India have been added to the Library since July last y these vol. xix. contains an account by Mr. H. B. W. of a tour through Behar, Central India, Pesh\u00e2 Yusufzai. General Cunningham explains that his a after photographing and exploring the old temples kandi, Mahadevp\u00fbr, and Banarak, visited the sites of and Darauli in Western Shahabad, where he found monoliths supposed to be the work of the aborigi further explored the remains of an old Buddhist mon.\nBarm\u0101yan, the ancient city of G\u016brga in Rewa, and certain sites which had been unvisited in the Yusufzai district. Of the monastery no tradition of any kind has been preserved locally, but a golden image is said to be buried in its immediate neighbourhood; its main walls, which are in ruins and traced with difficulty, cover an area of 100 feet from north to south by 67 from east to west. General Cunningham had proposed to identify it with the monastery built by Maharaja Sri Gupta for the use of the Chinese pilgrims who visited India. At Gurga or Gurgi Masun are the remains of an ancient city, measuring \"along the stone walls on the southern side 3475 feet, along the eastern wall 3041 feet, the north wall 2050 feet, and that to the west 3700 feet.\" A colossal figure in blue stone, and similar monuments, are to be seen in the locality. In the Yusufzai country Mr. Garrick thinks that many valuable inscriptions are yet to be found among the graveyards and Zi\u0101rats; but one of those brought to his notice he afterwards ascertained to have been discovered before by General Cunningham, whose account of it had actually been published.\n\nVol. xx. is the General's own report of a tour in Eastern Rajputana during the cold season of 1882-83. Some notion of the range of inquiry may be gathered from the statement that portions of Alwar, Bharatpur, Karauli, Dholpur, and Gwalior, with adjoining British districts of Dehli, Gurgam, and Mathura, were among the tracts visited. In Mathura he discovered several old inscriptions of the Indo-Scythic period, one of which he reckoned to be dated in A.D. 150; also a colossal statue seven feet high, cut in the round, with an inscription in Mauriya characters.\n\nVol. xxi. is in two parts, the first containing General Cunningham's personal reports of a tour in Bundelkhund and Rewa in 1883-4; the second of a tour in Rewa, Bundelkhund, Malwa, and Gwalior, in 1884-85. Among the more notable places visited were the great\nforts of Kalanjara and Ajaygarh, and Khajuraho, religious capital of the Chandels. Among other works an inscription of Prithvi Raja Chauhan was found at Madanpur, about 50 miles to the north of Sauvarna records,\" writes the General, \"his conquest of the city of Jejakabhukti. The same spelling of the name I have found in a Mahoba inscription. This then was its original form, which soon became shortened to Jejubhuti, as we find Abu Rihan, just as Tirabhuki became Tirahuti and Tirahut. The usual Brahminical derivation of the name of Jejakabhukti from Yajur-hota, is thus proved to be erroneous.\"\n\nVol. xxii. is Mr. Carleyle's \"Report of Tours in Gwalior, Saran, and Ghazipur in 1877-78-79-80.\" In this volume General Cunningham remarks that the discovery of Kapilavastu, the birthplace of Buddha, has been brought up \"by the identification of several other important sites connected with early history of Buddhism.\" Among these he mentions Rajgir, \"the site of the famous Stupa of R\u0101magr\u0101ma, from which the N\u0101gas are said to have filched the tooth of Buddha, that is now believed to be preserved in Ceylon,\" and other places or monuments, which appear to him to be very interesting. Of the last, the colossal statue of Buddha at Kasi, and the inscribed pillar of Asoka in the Tarai, are recorded. General Cunningham believes the statue to be identical with that seen by the Chinese pilgrims in A.D. 637. It was lying prostrate, with part of the inscription unreadable, its broken capital being attached to the shaft by a copper bolt. Hence the inference that the Hindus knew the destructive property of iron when used to fasten wood, which the General adds: \"I have long held the opinion that the Hindus knew and practised the art of stone-carving at least two centuries before the time of Asoka. Indeed, the name of Taxila, or Takshasila-Nagara, the 'city of learning,'\n\n1 Alluded to in Annual Report for last year, page lxiii, as also to the site of R\u0101magr\u0101ma and the statue at Kasi.\nbuildings, proves that the art was known and used before the time of Alexander.\u201d As regards our ignorance of any Indian inscription prior to Asoka, the learned commentator cannot but conclude that the beautifully-finished letters inscribed on the pillars of his period were preceded by a ruder alphabet, lost \u201cowing to the universal use of wood in early times.\u201d\n\nThe Theologische Literaturzeitung of the 11th July speaks well of the \u201cGeschichte des Alterthums\u201d of Mr. Edw. Meyer. It pronounces this first volume of a history of the East to the period of the founding of the Persian Empire, to be of great interest and to contain much new matter. To the Athen\u00e6um of the 5th September, Mr. Lindsay supplies a paper on the Faiyum papyri in the Bodleian Library, noticed by Mr. Nicholson, the librarian, in a subsequent number. The fragments are mostly written in Greek cursive characters, but several are in Coptic and some in Arabic. There is also in this issue a thoughtful review of tome iii. \u201cHistoire de l\u2019Art dans l\u2019Antiquit\u00e9\u2014Ph\u00e9nicie-Chypre,\u201d by Perrot and Chipiez, in which the reviewer points out how much has been done during the last two years to throw light upon a somewhat occult question, and define the \u201cR\u00f4le Historique des Ph\u00e9niciens.\u201d In the Academy of the same date, Dr. B\u00fchler notices Gen. Cunningham\u2019s discovery in the Panj\u00e1b-Haz\u00e1ra district of a new version (the seventh) of Asoka\u2019s Rock-edicts. It exhibits the so-called Bactrian, or Ariano-Pali characters. Such portions as he had been able to examine, through photographs, are stated to agree in every respect with the version of Shahbazgarhi. At the S\u00e9ance of the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions on the 11th September is an account of the work carried on in the West of Persia in continuation of M. Dieulafoy\u2019s proceedings reported in the Revue Arch\u00e9ologique. MM. Babin and Houssay, that gentleman\u2019s collaborateurs, driven away for four months by the heat of the plain country, proceeded to Ispahan by Ram\nHormuz, Shahpur, Shiraz and Persepolis. At M\u0101s\u0101n they visited by Layard in 1841, Loftus in 1852, and Wells in 1881, they made an inspection of the arch\u00e6ological relics of Kal'a Fir'aun and the Shig\u0101f-i-Salm\u016bn, photographs of the Elamite figures of the bas-reliefs, and the inscriptions heretofore only known by rough sketches. At Susa photographs were taken of the Sassanian bas-reliefs, which are to be \"in\u00e9dits\"; while at the Naksh-i-Rustam, some four or five miles west of the Takht-i-Jamshid (Persepolis), M. Babin caused a scaffolding to be raised before the Darius to carry on the same process in a thoroughly and complete manner. Seven inscriptions in turquoise were, moreover, brought to light from under a clay deposit. Whatever the results of M. Dieulafoy's exploration may be, it is hardly to be doubted that Susiana\u2014especially the city of Shushan\u2014has yet much to reveal to the arch\u00e6ologist. In the Athen\u00e6um of September 26 is a review of Professor Sayce on the Semitic origin of the Greek name Semele\u2014a name recurring in that of the Edomite king (Genesis xxxvi. 37). The same journal of the 3rd of October reviews favourably Professor Hall's narrative of an expedition to the Sinai Peninsula, Wadiu'l Arabah, and Southern Palestine. We learn from a report of a S\u00e9ance of the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions on the 20th November that the Museum of the Louvre had been enriched by ten objects found in Asia Minor; and that among other curiosities placed in it by M. Schlumberger was a gold ring from Persepolis belonging to the Patrician Aetus who was martyred by the Saracens on the banks of the Euphrates in A.D. 846. At another S\u00e9ance of the same Academy on the 27th November the subject was that of Sanskrit inscriptions of Kambuja, which had been collected by M. Aymonier, and published by M. Barth. The most ancient of these antedated the seventh century, the most modern to the eleventh, and were said to throw much light on Indian history. On\noldest cites the Ramayana. Another and later S\u00e9ance was interesting from its treatment of Annam Inscriptions, obtained in the provinces of Binh Thuan, Khanh Hoa, Phu Yen and Binh Dinh\u2014all in the ancient kingdom of Champ\u00e1, known to and described by Marco Polo. They confirm the Indian civilization of the country, and introduction therein of the various Brahmanical forms of worship, also of a Buddhism as in Kambuj. They are written in Sanskrit, and a dialect spoken in Binh Thuan; and they supply the names of some twenty kings, whose names end in varman, that flourished during the years from 784 to 1436 of the Christian era. The removal, in 1881, of the standing monument called Cleopatra's Needle from Alexandria to New York, has been made the raison d'\u00eatre of a volume on Egyptian Obelisks by Commander Gorringe of the U. S. Navy, reviewed in the Athen\u00e6um of the 26th December. The work is said to be exhaustive, and its shortcomings are attributed to the repetition of commonly-received errors, \"unavoidable owing to the march of science and philology\" in a wide field. To the Academy of December 26, Mr. C. J. Lyall contributes a learned article on Euting's Nabatean Inscriptions. He shows how the valley, or rather \"depression\" of El Higr or Hegr, about 165 miles to the N.W. of Madinah, was in the first century of the Christian era, the southernmost point of the kingdom of Aretas\u2014he whose governor \"kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison\" (2 Cor. xi. 32). \"The commerce of the Sabeans,\" he states, \"was transferred to the camels of the Nabateans, a people reckoned by classical writers among the Arabians, of whom we first hear as a united power about 300 B.C.\" As to the inscriptions, they are found on tablets placed on the semi-classical frontages of rock-hewn sepulchres, and they bear the names of those who built or dedicated them, a limitation of their use to certain inheritors, and a denunciation of penalty against those who violate or alienate them. Mr. Lyall disagrees with, and combats Mr. Berger's \"strange\" theory\nthat classical Arabic owes its spread throughout Asia to Muhammad.\n\nProfessor Ramsay's note on the river Castrum in the Athen\u00e6um of the 2nd January of the current year gives forth the discovery of its true source by the late Colonel Stewart of the 11th Hussars in an exploration of the headwaters of Tauras, has not merely an archaeological and geographical interest, but evokes a new tribute of respect for the memory of Charles Gordon's only companion on his last journey to Khartoum. An article in the same paper, four weeks ago, headed \"News from Central Asia,\" mentions some archaeological researches carried out under the direction of Professor Vesslofsky, partly in the environs of Samarkand and partly in the northern districts of Khokand. In the former locality, remains of a Pre-Islamic period had been found, which may throw light on the doings of Alexander in Transoxiana or on the epoch of Buddhism in the same region. The Athen\u00e6um of the 10th April notices that the late Subhi Pasha, numismatist and archaeologist of Constantinople, had presented Sultan an agate seal of the Prophet, identified by the experts as the only preserved heirloom of the three seals which Muhammad is reported by the initiated to have possessed. The next week's number is a notice of the opening to the public of the new collections in the department of the British Museum, which Mr. Franks presides over. Among these are some specimens of early Buddhist remains excavated by Cunningham at Jamulgarhi. The Athen\u00e6um of the same date states that ancient ruins of interest, older than the fort of Aynthia in 1350, had lately been discovered in Siam near Chiangmai. A marked feature in the discovery is the material used in the construction of the buildings is not brick, agreeably to modern local custom. Some inscriptions had also been discovered, but do not appear to have been deciphered. The Academy of the same date has a communication from General Schindler, from Tehran, in which\nto identify places mentioned by the older geographers with those now visited by travellers. In the district Rivend of the Arabs he finds the modern Nishapur; in the mountain Raeventa of the Shahn\u00e2ma a section of the mountains in that province; in the Gunabat of the Shahn\u00e2ma the Gunabad of to-day, and so on. The paper will repay perusal, and is worth closer examination. Some fifteen days after publication it called forth a short supplementary notice from Munich. \"Le Roi Donaghi \u00e0 Tello\" is the title of an article by M. Heuzey, in the Revue Arch\u00e9ologique for April and May, 1886, in which the writer deals with the very difficult question of the age and political relations of the Sumerian and Akkadian King of Ur of the Chaldees. The pages of our Journal will tell their own tale of the more recent explorations on the Northern Afghan frontier and at Bamian.\n\nIn the Indian Antiquary for June, 1885, Pandit S. M. Natesa Sastri continues his paper on the Folklore of Southern India, the subject being \"The good husband and the bad wife.\" Captain R. C. Temple has a paper on \"The Delhi Delals and their Slang,\" a dialect used for the purposes of secrecy and deception. Professor Kielhorn of G\u00f6ttingen writes on \"A Copper Plate Grant of Vakpatriraja of Dhara,\" of which he furnishes a transcript and translation. The inscription has already been published by Dr. Rajendralal Mitra in the Bengal Asiatic Society's Journal, vol. xix. p. 475. Dr. A. F. Rudolf Hoernle has a paper on \"The Palas of Bengal,\" reprinted with revision from the Centenary Review of the Researches of the Asiatic Society Bengal 1784-1883, Part ii. Appendix ii. The historical interest of the Pala dynasty is very great, for they were Buddhists in religion, and they ruled over the whole of Bengal from Oudh eastward to the sea during the tenth century A.D., before the rise of the dynasty of the Senas. The object of Dr. Hoernle's paper is to reconstruct the chronology of the Palas by means of a more\ncareful reading of the Amgachhi inscriptions, of which he prints a revised text. He reduces the number of Pal from eleven to only six. Mr. Howorth continues his paper \"On Chinghiz Khan and his Ancestors.\"\n\nIn the number for July is a \"Note\" by Captain R. O., on \"A Modern Ornamental Kufic Alphabet from Mr. G. A. Grierson, B.C.S., contributes an interesting upon Vidyapati, the most famous of the old master-singers of Bihar, and his contemporaries. Dr. E. Hultzsch, of writes on \"A Copper Plate Grant of the Gujarat Rash King Dhruva II., dated Saka 757 (A.D. 835-836). inscription was found at Baroda. A German version paper has appeared in the Journal of the German Society. In the \"Miscellanea\" Sir Walter Elliot note on the family and date of the great Rajendra of Tanjore, in which he refers to the two inscriptions cont by Mr. Fleet to the February number of this volume Thomas Foulkes contributes a \"Note on the Ge of the Cholas,\" and Mr. Best continues his translation \"Proverbs of Ali Ebn Abi Talebi.\"\n\nIn the number for August the first paper is \"The Alha's Marriage; a Bhojpuri Epic,\" edited and tra by Mr. G. A. Grierson, B.C.S. The Eastern version exploits of the famous Bundelkhand heroes Alha and only exists in the mouths of itinerant singers, and is always couched in the Bhojpuri dialect of Hindi. T given by Mr. Grierson was obtained with considerab culty from the mouth of one of these men, and h carefully revised with the help of competent Bhojpuri Dr. Georgio B\u00fchler, C.I.E., contributes \"A Note on a Old Palm Leaf MS. from Japan,\" which has recent discovered by Mr. Bunyin Nanjio. The leaf possess importance for Indian palaeography. The counter Buddhistic, and probably belong to one of the larger Short as the piece is, it furnishes several new wo\nhitherto found in the Sanskrit dictionaries. In the third paper Mr. J. F. Fleet continues his remarks on \"Sanskrit and Old Kanarese Inscriptions,\" the present paper being devoted to the \"British Museum Plates of Eregana.\" Mr. Lewis Rice, C.I.E., M.R.A.S., writes on a \"Jaina-Vaishnava Compact\" engraved on a stone at the Jaina town of \u015aravana-Belgojor. It is known as R\u0101m\u0101nuja-ch\u0101ri's \u015a\u0101sana. The inscription is in Hale-Kannada characters, and in the Kannada language. Mr. Whitley Stokes has a note on \"Another Baumayantra\" obtained some years ago from a gentleman in Benares. Mr. K. T. Best continues \"The Proverbs of Ali Ebn Abi Talebi.\" There is also a notice of \"An Examination of the Claims of Ishmael as viewed by the Muhammadans,\" by J. D. Bate. The reviewer explains it to be the first chapter of the first section of an immense work that the author has in hand, entitled \"Studies in Islam.\" The part issued is in itself a volume, and is an attack on the cardinal Muhammadan doctrine that Ishmael and not Isaac was the \"Child of Promise.\" It is therefore considered as the commencement of a general attack along the whole line of Muhammadan dogma.\n\nThe September number contains a paper by Mr. E. Rehatsek on \"Russian Icons.\" The second paper is by the Rev. J. Hinton Knowles, and gives a Kashmiri tale entitled \"The Prince that was three times Shipwrecked.\" The third paper is a \"Summary of the Alha Khand,\" by Mr. G. A. Grierson, B.C.S. In the Miscellanea Mr. K. T. Best continues \"The Proverbs of Ali Ebn Abi Talebi.\"\n\nIn October, the Rev. Hinton Knowles writes on the Kashmiri Portable Brazier, called the k\u0101ngar or k\u0101ngr\u0101; Mr. Howorth continues his chronicle of Chinghiz Khan and his Ancestors; a long paper by Mr. Ball on the identification of the animals and plants of India known to early Greek authors is reproduced, with additions and revisions, from the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy; and Mr. Fleet resumes his inquiries on Sanskrit and Old Kanarese Inscriptions. In\nthe Correspondence and Miscellanea, it is to be noticed that one of the six proverbs of Ali Ebn Abi Talebi, \"The heart of a fool is in his mouth, and the tongue of a wise man is in his heart,\" is almost word for word Ecclesiasticus xxi. 20.\n\nIn November, Mr. Fleet's Sanskrit and Kanarese Inscriptions and selection of Kanarese Ballads; a continuation of Mr. Ball's paper of the previous month; Mr. Pattibai Wadia's Folklore in Western India; and a learned article on the identification of places in the Sanskrit Geography of India, with a book notice and Miscellanea supplied by Mr. Grierson and Dr. B\u00fchler, make up a highly satisfactory number; and the following double part issue, in completion of the year, is again largely indebted to Mr. Fleet and Mr. Ball, who, with Professor Kielhorn, the Hon. K. T. Telang and Dr. B\u00fchler, contribute to its pages. The last-named able writer has an appreciative notice of the Centenary Review of the Bengal Asiatic Society.\n\nFor January, 1886, the first part of vol. xv., Mr. Longworth Dames writes on \"Old Seals found at Harappa,\" in the Montgomery District of the Panjab; Mr. Pattibai Wadia on Folklore; and Professor Kielhorn on Copper Plate Grants in Kanauj; Mr. Grierson introduces an English-Gipsy Index compiled by Mrs. Grierson; and Mr. Edward Thomas publishes extracts from Chinese authors concerning the history of the Kushans. M. Stein's \"Afghanistan in Avestic Geography\" is a reprint from the Academy touching upon questions which have been more largely treated by Sir Henry Rawlinson; and the book notices are remarkable for an elaborate article by Sir Walter Elliot, reviewing Mr. Egerton's Illustrated Handbook of Indian Arms, and a preliminary notice of Beruni's Indica, by Dr. B\u00fchler.\n\nThe number for February opens with a paper by Professor Kielhorn on the Sasbahu Temple Inscriptions of Mahipala of Vikrama Sanivat 1150. This is followed by a continuation of Folklore in Western India; a translation into Sanskrit\nby Professor Weber of the British National Anthem; and an additional part of Mrs. Grierson's Gipsy-Index. The Miscellanea are unusually brief, but the book notices would be interesting, if only for including the Thousand and One Nights, by that marvellous traveller and Orientalist, Sir Richard Burton.\n\nA question which\u2014if Oriental study and research can ever be called popular\u2014would be an especially popular one at the present day, is that of the comparative study of Asiatic Symbolism. Mr. Murray-Aynsley supplies \"Discursive Contributions\" on this in March. Colonel Jacob adds an article on the readings of the Nrisimhatapaniya Upanishad; and the Rev. Hinton Knowles one in the form of a Kashmiri tale, entitled Gullala Shah. Professor Kielhorn contributes notes on the Mahabhashya, while Mrs. Grierson continues her English-Gipsy Index. Book notices complete the number.\n\nThere is no new original contribution in April, which continues already mentioned papers by Mr. Murray Aynsley, the Rev. Hinton Knowles, Mr. Fleet, and Mrs. Grierson. The retirement of General Cunningham, after a connection with India, and \"with the study of Indian Archaeology in all its branches, that has lasted more than half a century,\" naturally calls for special notice.\n\nThe first three articles in May and the Gipsy-Index are continuations of papers. There is also a passage in the Jain Harivamsa relating to the Guptas from the pen of Mr. K. B. Pathak, B.A., with a note by Mr. Fleet. Prominent among the book notices is Mr. Fleet's review of the Journal of the Bombay Branch Royal Asiatic Society, to which we have before alluded.\n\nPalestine Exploration Fund.\u2014At the annual meeting held on 24th June, 1885, it was announced that the Committee had received a magnificent contribution to the Survey of the East, in a packet of memoirs, plans, and maps from Herr Schumacher. This, certainly the most important examination,\nso far as it goes, of the Janlan district, as yet made traveller, is put forward as the principal work of the map covers about 200 square miles; and the contain a list of Arabic names, a general description country, and an account, with plans and drawings villages and sites visited. Among the principal ruins may be mentioned Khurbet Arkub er Rahwah, which Schumacher would identify with the Argob of the Bible, only placed at the Lejjah, and those in Bait Ak Ain Dakhar. North of the last is a field of near Dolmens, called by the natives Kabar Bani Israil\u2014of the children of Israel. Ancient stone bridges were crossing the stream at Nahrun Allan and Nahr Rukk a remarkable altar and statue of basalt at Kefr el M village called Sahem el Jolan, Herr Schumacher think discovered the Biblical Golan, which has hitherto identification. The ruins of the remarkable under city of Ed Dera were examined and planned for the first time together with the towns and monuments of El Mezeiri and Nawar, identified by Mr. Oliphant with the land. Other subterranean buildings were found at Khurbet and at Sheik Saad. The rock-tomb of Job was also graphed and planned. Mention is made of a Dolmen recently discovered in Judaea, where hitherto none had been observed, and it was supposed that all had been destroyed. It lies in a desert and hilly part of the country between Khurbet Aujeh-el-Foka (Sheet xv. O.r.) and El (Sheet xv. N.q.).\n\nHow Mr. Oliphant came upon the Dolmen and a sarcophagus in Zimmarin is related in the July number, which contains Report, enriched also with an account of Mr. Guy Le Strange's interesting journey east of Jordan, and Herr Hanau's discovery of a Rock Altar near Zorah suggestive of that of Samson (Judges xiii.). Moreover, in this particular issue, we notice of our late lamented Secretary, Mr. Vaux,\nconnection with the Palestine Exploration Fund, must not be forgotten. It need scarcely be repeated here that Schumacher's \"Across the Jordan,\" with appendices, maps, plans and drawings, is published as a separate record.\n\nThe Quarterly Statements for October, and January and April (1886), are full of valuable papers. Among them are Mr. Oliphant's \"New Discoveries,\" and \"Excavations on Carmel,\" Mr. Chichester Hart's \"Naturalist's Journey,\" and contributions by Capt. Conder, Dr. Merrill, the Rev. W. F. Birch, Herr Hanauer and Mr. Greville Chester. But these are by no means all the names of those who supply this admirable serial with readable and instructive articles. A valuable archaeological communication from the pen of a less prominent contributor may be found in the April number under the head of \"The Aqueducts of Siloam.\"\n\nHerr Schick, in describing this particular locality at the present day, writes: \"When the Pool of Siloam is mentioned, that which contains water is generally meant; below this there is another and much larger pool, now used as a garden, and called Birket el Hamra; it is formed by a thick wall or dam built across the Tyrop\u00e6an Valley from Ophel ('City of David') to the Western hill (Jerusalem).\" Outside the dam the writer had himself observed, in 1846, a tank of an oval form, since filled up; and two other tanks were discovered by Professor Guthe, one as late as 1841, near the north of the Pool of Siloam. \"There is now,\" he adds, \"only one real pool, but ancient Christian writers mention several . . . one called 'Natatoria,' or the swimming pool; it was large, and had a kind of apsidal end; this appears to be the Birket el Hamra.\" He then goes on to describe traces of aqueducts now coming to light; the famous one, and several others which he took note of when clearing out the main aqueduct into which they all lead. Going down the road from the Pool of Siloam to the mill, he saw in the rock-wall to his left a hole; this he cleared out, and found to be a rock-hewn tunnel crossed by\nanother, the exploration of which led eventually to discovery of a \"second aqueduct.\" After a detailed account of his investigations, he concludes by making certain suggestions to the Palestine Exploration Fund, the effect of which is to the effect that something might be found hitherto unexplored caves on the southern side of Ophel might throw light on the \"Tombs of the Kings.\" Sir William Wilson, in remarking on Herr Schick's paper, gives an account of the discovery of a \"second aqueduct,\" partially restored, which is very interesting; moreover, that his description makes clear how \"the lower pool, Birket el Hamra, received its water direct from the 'Fountain of the Virgin,' at some point which Herr Schick places prior to the completion of what is now known Siloam Tunnel.\"\n\nMention has been made of the work in Western Asia carried on by M. Dieulafoy's collaborators; but leaving the subject of Biblical Archaeology, it may be proper to revert to that gentleman's own proceedings reported in the Revue Arch\u00e9ologique.\n\nThe mound of Susa, an artificial hill from 25 to 30 feet high, and of about 100 hectares in extent, had been explored in 1851, by Loftus, who discovered there the celebrated Inscription of Artaxerxes Mnemon. Continuing these investigations, M. Dieulafoy came upon a double-headed sword nearly four metres long, similar to the Persepolitan example; part of the crown of the pylons placed before the palace of Artaxerxes; two fragments of a porcelain balustrade of the Elamite epoch, curious specimens of the most ancient Elamite art; fragments of bas-reliefs in enamelled brick, representing negroes clothed with royal insignia, suggesting an opinion whether the dynasty which preceded that of the Achaeans was of Ethiopic descent; various utensils of ivory, bronze, and earthenware, but nothing of gold or silver; a great number of Elamite or Achaemenian seals, etc., and an opal which appears to have belonged to Xerxes.\nArtaxerxes I.; a series of bricks and st\u00e8les with inscriptions; and lastly, two-thirds of one of the towers which defended the entrance to the palace\u2014part of a very complete and scientific system of fortification. In a future exploration M. Dieulafoy hoped to penetrate into the Elamite palace.\n\nAmong the principal papers in the 3rd fascicule of the Gazette Arch\u00e9ologique is one on ancient Sculptures found in Carthage (Mus\u00e9e Saint-Louis), by MM. Reinach and Babelon.\n\nAt the s\u00e9ance of the 17th June of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Antiquaires de France M. Germain Bapst announced that excavations had been made at Van (Armenia), resulting in the discovery of some monuments of Chald\u00e6o-Assyrian art, the workmanship of which recalls that of the bronze seat obtained from the same place by the Marquis de Vog\u00fc\u00e9.\n\nIn the Revue Critique of 7th September M. Clermont Ganneau contributes a \"Note d'Arch\u00e9ologie Orientale\" on the subject of the positions of Segor, Gomorrah, and Sodom.\n\nIn the Academy of 1st August is the notice of an interesting discovery recently made at Sidon, showing that the Ph\u0153nician city was preceded by an older settlement, whose inhabitants were still in the Stone age. Some natives, excavating for stone, after penetrating through the alluvial soil, had dug through a deposit of blown sand, six m\u00e8tres in depth, below which they found a stratum of earth containing flint implements, fragments of coarse red pottery, and other objects, among them a clay whistle.\n\nThe Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres has adjudged the Jean Reynaud prize to M. Aymonier, for his scientific voyages of exploration and arch\u00e6ological discoveries in Indo-China.\n\nWe are told in the Athen\u00e6um of the 8th August of a grant for the repair of the little mosque of Santa Sophia in the Seraglio, in which the Imperial Ottoman Museum is placed; moreover, that a collection of Egyptian antiquities had been commenced in the form of presents from an Egyptian prince.\nThe fifth volume of the \"Journal of Hellenic Studies\" contains a paper on \"Sepulchral Customs in Ancient Palestine\" by Mr. W. M. Ramsay, representing a further outcome of the researches in Asia Minor which he intended to pursue in the spring.\n\nIn \"L'Art de la Verrerie,\" by Gerspach, recently published, there are details on the antique productions of Egypt, Phoenicia, and Greece, while the division treating of Eastern glassware deals with the products of Byzantium, Persia, Damascus, and China. The ancient glass of this last-named country was considered by Dr. Friedrich Hirth, in his paper \"Die Geschichte des Glases in China und des Antiken Orient,\" published in the June number of the Oesterreichische Monatsberichte \u00fcber den Orient, in which the writer concludes that the Chinese first derived their knowledge of glass from the Phoenicians.\n\nSemitic Literature.\u2014Hebrew and Chaldee.\u2014\"The papers read at Canon Driver's house at Oxford,\" refer to the last Report as about to be printed, have appeared under the general title of \"Studia Biblica.\" The volume contains ten articles, of which Dr. Neubauer and Professor Sayce each contributed two, the remainder being the work of Edersheim, Professors Driver and Wordsworth, and Mr. Ward, Gwilliam, and Randell respectively. A careful review in the Athen\u00e6um of the 19th September analyzes the contents of this interesting collection of essays, nearly all of which are regarded as \"adaptations, for English students of theology, of German work on Bible subjects.\" As the reviewer awards the palm for interest to Mr. Randell and Dr. Neubauer, it may be well to state that the first bears testimony to the importance of classical epigraphy in the early history of the Church, and the second gives a learned r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of discoveries in Nabath\u00e6an and Temanite epigraphy, and a separate paper on the languages spoken in Jud\u00e6a in the time of our Lord.\nDr. Mo\u00efse Schwab, of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Paris, a scholar distinguished in the field of Rabbinical literature, who has for some years past been engaged upon a French version of the Talmud, of which five volumes have appeared, has now undertaken an English translation after the model of the French, of which the opening tractate, the \"Tractate Berachoth,\" has recently been published. In the Standard of 22nd August is a long article with special reference to this publication. The writer points out how, when the Syro-Aramaean dialect fell into disuse, and was gradually forgotten, much of the Talmud became unintelligible without numerous glosses, which in time slipped from the margin into the text, and when, finally, came the scissors of the Church censors, confusion was made worse confounded. Thus, any modern translation of the Talmud should be accompanied by full explanations and comments, to make the allusions\u2014of which the work is full\u2014clear, and the meaning manifest to those unacquainted with the methods of Rabbinical teaching. This appears to be a want in Dr. Schwab's version.\n\nIn the Academy of 25th July is a review by Dr. Driver of Prolegomena to the History of Israel, with a reprint of the article \"Israel\" from the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, by Julius Wellhausen. \"Its aim, viewed as a whole, is,\" we are told, \"to develope and illustrate a theory of the history and legislation of the ancient Hebrews, which, though commonly associated with the name of Graf, has found its most able and powerful exponent in Professor Wellhausen.\" Messrs. Black and Menzies are praised for the manner in which they have accomplished the translation, and retained the \"lucid and incisive\" style of the original.\n\nThe Athen\u00e6um of 11th July briefly notices Dr. Robert Young's \"Grammatical Analysis of the Book of Psalms in Hebrew,\" and recommends it to students as the \"outcome of careful labour and extensive knowledge.\" It also reviews the Rev. W. Randolph's \"Analytical Notes on the First and\nthree Last of the Minor Prophets,\" a book intended for use of Hebrew students of the intermediate class.\n\nIn a letter to the Athen\u00e6um of the 1st August Dr. states that he possesses an edition of Kimchi's Grammar, nearly ten years older than the supposed pr\u00e6ciput, which is dated 1534. Unlike the 1534 edition, it does not give in the margin the references either to the respective books of the Scriptures or to the chapters quoted in the body of the text. He notes that folios 53, 60, 77 and 82 are blank, a circumstance remarked in other early-printed Hebrew books.\n\nThe same journal of the 8th August announces Hartwig Hirschfeld, the translator into German of Halevi's philosophico-theological work usually called \"Hasidim,\" has in readiness for the press the original Arabic text, together with the unique MS. preserved in the Bodleian Library. He is to add in parallel columns the Hebrew translation of Jedidiah Ibn Tibbon, collated with several MSS.\n\nThe Academy of 5th September notifies the publication of Herr Morris Jastrow of an able and careful monograph on \"Abu Zakarijja Jalija ben Dawud Hajj\u00fbg und seine Grammatischen Schriften.\" Hayy\u00fbj, who belong to the middle of the tenth century, may be regarded as the author of scientific Hebrew grammar. The two treatises which are the subject of this essay are still unpublished although several MSS. exist.\n\nThe Academy of 3rd October has a note on \"Die Kohelet: nach der Auslassung der Weisen des Talmudischen Midrasch und der j\u00fcdischen Erkl\u00e4rer des Mittheilteils,\" \"Von der Mischna bis zum Abschluss des Talmud. Nebst zahlreichen kritischen Noten, und einer Abhandlung von Rabbiner Dr. Sinai Schiffer.\" Dr. thinks that a collection of the Talmudic and Misnagdik explanations of biblical passages, arranged chronologically, would be of much use to philological expositors of the Old Testament.\nIn the *Revue des \u00c9tudes Juives*, Janvier-Juin, 1885, M. J. Hal\u00e9vy, Recherches Bibliques III., writes \"Sur l'origine du dans les noms propres compos\u00e9s,\" and under the head \"Bibliographie\" reviews Frederic Delitzsch's \"The Hebrew Language,\" with special reference to its comparison with Assyrian.\n\nIn the *Literarisches Centralblatt* of the 11th July is an appreciative review of \"The Comparative Philology of Hebrew-Arabic Tongues,\" by Ab\u00fal Wal\u00eed Merw\u00e2n Ibn Gan\u00e2h (Rabbi Jona). The learned reviewer, Professor Bucher, has since published the Life and Works of the Grammarian, favourably noticed in the *Revue des \u00c9tudes Juives*.\n\nDr. F. Rosenthal has published \"Vier Apokryphische B\u00fccher aus der Zeit und Schule R. Akibas.\" The publication is reviewed with approval by M. Steinschneider in the *Deutsche Literaturzeitung* of 5th September.\n\nFrom the pen of Dr. W\u00fcnsche we have, in the Bibliotheca Rabinica, \"Der Midrasch,\" and \"Der Midrasch Bemid bar Rabba,\" a review of which appeared in the *Literarisches Centralblatt* of 22nd August. In the same journal, No. 30, of 18th July, M. Perles' \"Beitr\u00e4ge zur Geschichte der Hebr\u00e4ischen und Aram\u00e4ischen Studien\" was pronounced to be full of interest.\n\nOne of the communications presented to the meeting of the American Oriental Society at Boston in May, 1885, was on \"The Holy Houses from the Hebrew Scriptures; also from the original texts of the Chronicles, Ezra, Maccabees, Septuagint, Coptic, Itala, Chaldee, Syrian, Samaritan, Talmud and leading Rabbis, by Professor J. A. Paine, of Elmwood, Massachusetts.\"\n\nThe *Academy* of the 12th September, mentioning the contents of the Expositor for that month, refers to Professor Driver's notes on the revised version of Leviticus and Numbers as \"very full and valuable for the history of exegesis.\" They are concluded in October.\nIn the *Athen\u00e6um* of the 7th November we read of a publication, in the press, of the Hebrew MSS. of the Peshitta, in the Chetham Library, Manchester, by the Rev. Dr. Gillespie, to be issued in pamphlet form, under the title \"Codex Chethamensis.\" On the 14th, the same journal announces the appointment, at Berlin, under the presidency of the Deutsch-Israelitischer Gemeindebund, of a Commission for the publication of original documents concerning Jewish settlers in the Holy Roman Empire, A.D. 1273, and minor papers, a special volume being devoted to writings in Hebrew.\n\nThe annual notices of Continental literature which appear in the first issue of the *Athen\u00e6um* for the New Year are of great interest and value, but they contain little of importance under the present head. When a Mosaic theme is treated rather from the philosophical than philological point of view, We may, however, notice two publications which appear under the head \"Theological Books,\" in the number of February; one, a Rabbinical commentary on Genesis, translated by Mr. Hershon from the Jud\u00e6o-Polish; and another, the Talmud of Jerusalem, translated \"for the first time\" by Dr. Moses Schwab. This last, as already stated, is an English translation into English of a French translation; but it appears that the meaning is far from clear, and the reviewer draws the conclusion that \"the Talmud must be studied in its original language, and with critical knowledge of the subjects treated in it.\" So far back as the 3rd October, the *Academy* had noticed the English translation as an unknown collaborateur who had done his work in France, but the *Athen\u00e6um* speaks of it as by Dr. Schwab.\n\nUnder \"Literary Gossip\" the *Athen\u00e6um* of the 2nd November states that Dr. Neubauer's Catalogue of the Hebrew MSS. in Oxford was approved for publication by the Delegate of the Press; and repeats a statement of the *J\u00fcdische Woche* that Signor E. Hoepli, the Milan bookseller, possesses\nMS. of Maimonides' ritual work, entitled \"Mishneh Thorah,\" purchased by Don Isaac Abraband in the 15th century.\n\nA long article on \"Animal Names of the Revised Version of the Bible,\" in the Academy of April 24, by the Rev. W. Houghton, opens an interesting field of inquiry, and will, no doubt, have attracted the attention of Oriental scholars.\n\nVol. viii. part 3 of the Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology (1885) has some remarkable papers. That upon the \"Handicrafts and Artizans mentioned in Talmudical Writings,\" by Dr. Louis, intended to throw light upon the social and industrial habits of the Jews about 2000 years ago, contains information which may be useful to those who are students, as well as mere readers of the Bible. In the Proceedings of the Society the Rev. C. J. Ball continues his illustrations of Hebrew verse, by adding to his specimens of trisyllabic metre, suggested metrical arrangements of Bible passages, such as \"The Great P\u00e6an, or Lob-gesang, of which we have two independent copies preserved respectively in 2 Sam. xxii., and in the Psalter (Psalm xviii.).\" He has examined and metrically divided, and he shows the Poem to consist of \"combinations of octosyllabic, heptasyllabic, and hexasyllabic stichi, with an obviously Iambic rhythm.\" It may interest Hebrew scholars to know that an entirely new French version of the Psalms, preceded by a word for word rendering, and a \"petite grammaire Hebra\u00efque et dictionnaire des racines,\" by M. B. Moss\u00e9, a Rabbi of Avignon, was published in that city, as also in Paris, in 1880, and, though not perhaps likely to afford much aid to critical research, cannot fail to be useful in comparing translations. While on this subject it may be stated that the Rev. Dr. Chotzner's work on Hebrew rhymed prose, called \"Sichronoth; or Reminiscences of a Student of Jewish Theology,\" is accompanied by an English essay on the \"Rise and Progress of Hebrew Poetry in post-Biblical Times.\"\nAmong the more recently published books may be mentioned the following:\n\nThe Pentateuch, its Age and Authorship, by Dr. R. Ewald's History of Israel, translated by J. F. Smith, Le Po\u00e8me de Job, d'apr\u00e8s le texte Biblique, par Bernard de Montmelian; La Cantique des Cantiques, traduction en vers, par Jean Laher, d'apr\u00e8s la version de M. D\u00e9couvertes en Chald\u00e9e, par Ernest de Sarzec, 1\u00e8re L. La Monarchie chez les Juifs en Palestine, par Emil Le Proph\u00e8te Habakuk, introduction critique et ex\u00e9g\u00e9tique, examen sp\u00e9cial des Commentaires Rabbiniques du Texte de la Tradition, par Antoine J. Baumgartner. [The book truly says: \"Une production litt\u00e9raire de la valeur de Habakuk m\u00e9rite, en effet, plus qu'aucune autre, l'attention de tous ceux qui aiment et qui admirent l'antique po\u00e9sie Hebra\u00efque.\" Dr. Pusey (Minor Prophets) and other known English commentators have taken up the subject; the third and last chapter of this grand book is described by Smith's Dictionary of the Bible as \"the magnificence... unrivalled for boldness of conception, sublimity of thought, and majesty of diction.\"] B. Strassburg, Geschichte der Erziehung und Unterricht bei den Israeliten der Vor-Talmud Zeit bis zur Gegenwart; B. Drach, Die Bedeutung d. Jeluda Hajjug in der Hebr\u00e4ischen Grammatik; G. Karpeles, Geschichte der J\u00fcdischen Literatur; P. Friedrich, Die Hebr\u00e4ischen Conditionalss\u00e4tze; Carl L. Abrahams, Grammatik der Neuhebr\u00e4ischen Sprache; Herm. L. Abriss der Neuhebr\u00e4ischen Literatur [the two last publications, reviewed in the Austrian Monatschrift f\u00fcr den Orient for October].\n\nAssyriology.\u2014On the 2nd June, 1885, at the Society for Biblical Archaeology, Mr. T. C. Pinches read a paper entitled \"A Series of Specimens of the Familiar Correspondence between Babylonians and Assyrians\"; and on the 3rd idem...\nBritish Archaeological Association, one \"On Babylonian Cylinders.\" The Journal of Assyriology (Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Assyriologie), published by Schulze, at Leipzig, has now been issued for January and June, and takes the place of the Journal of Cuneiform Research (Keilschriftforschung). Its object is international, and it seeks to carry on its work by co-operation from abroad as at home. In this sense it is represented by the foremost Assyriologists of Europe; and the names of Sayce for Oxford, Oppert for Paris, and Schrader for Berlin, carry its guarantee of scholarship. The first number has seven papers, inclusive of criticisms, and is completed by a short but pertinent \"Bibliographie.\" The second issue (June) has eight papers and a \"Bibliographie.\" Under the head \"Sprechsaal\" are some interesting notes and comments on previously published articles or statements. Among them we find Prof. Oppert correcting M. Delitzsch for interpreting, as he himself had done before, the verb napahu as \"to rise,\" whereas, coupled with samsi, it signifies, like the Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0623\u062e\u0631 mid-day, or the period of the sun in full power. Two numbers of the superseded journal, i.e. for July and November, have yet to be noticed. They contain in all 15 articles, besides reviews of books and Bibliographie. Mr. Pinches contributes additions and corrections to the fifth volume of the Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia, and two texts from Sippara of the Sun-god; one, referring to blacksmith's work, dated in Tammuz, 13th year of the reign of Nabonidus, King of Babylon; the other in Nisan, 14th year of the same monarch. Professor Sayce continues his learned exposition of \"an ancient Babylonian work on medicine.\" The remaining papers are by Messrs. Schrader, Gr\u00fcnbaum, Latrille, Haupt, Jensen, Lehmann, and Delitzsch, besides fresh writers in the \"Sprechsaal.\"\n\nM. Carl Bezold, editor of the Zeitschrift just noticed, writes to the Academy from Munich, under date the 1st August,\na resum\u00e9 of recent work in Assyriology. Honourable mention is made of M. de Sarzec's excavations, resulting in a collection of ancient Babylonian inscriptions, of which he reported last year the issue of the first part; also of Joachim M\u00e9nant's Catalogue m\u00e9thodique et raisonn\u00e9 de la Collection de M. de Clercq; the autograph by the Rev. Dr. Strausmaier, of \"a beautiful Cuneiform text from a newly discovered cylinder, now in the Metropolitan Museum in New York\" (transcribed and translated, with introduction and notes, by Dr. O'Connor, of the Woodstock College, Maryland); the researches of Mr. Pinches, recorded in the Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, and in the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Keilschriftforschung, and of Professor Sayce, who has published the third edition of Professor Delitzsch's Assyrische Grammatik, \"with grammatical paradigms, a full list of signs, a vocabulary of Babylonian and archaic forms of the Cuneiform script, and a newly collated or entirely new texts, like the so-called 'reading-book' of the king Asnapper (Kouyunjik 4378), the eleventh tablet of the Surpu series, or so-called Deluge tablet, newly translated by Oppert, and a short Assyrian glossary.\" As regards the labours of our own countrymen, the Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology for May, 1885, show the interest taken in a curious Babylonian text by Mr. Pinches, results of work done by Babylonian workmen on board the steamer Darius, and papers by Professor Sayce on inscriptions Assur-Bani-Pal and Tarkondemos. Besides these, the learned editor notices especially Dr. Jensen's dissertation on the sixth tablet of the Surpu series as useful for lexical and comparative studies; a brochure called \"Bal Buss-psalmen,\" by Dr. Zimmermann, of Erlangen (who very rejects the theory on the Sumerian language contributor, Dr. Fritz Hommel); an \"excellent\" dissertation on Assyrian Phonology, by Professor Haupt, published by the Chicago Hebraica; and an \"interesting\" paper\nBertin on Assyrian and Akkadian Pronouns, which appeared in our Journal for January, 1885.\n\nIn the *Academy* of July 4 is a favourable review of the \"Cuneiform Inscriptions and the Old Testament,\" by Professor Eberhard Schrader, of Berlin, translated from the second enlarged German edition by the Rev. Owen Whitehouse, M.A. The reviewer expresses his regret that the translator has not always given the Hebrew proper names in the forms adopted in the English Bible.\n\nIn the *Mus\u00e9on* for June, 1885, Mr. E. J. de Dillon notices Prof. Sayce's \"Fresh Light from the Ancient Monuments,\" and gives a cordial welcome to this new work from his \"plume infatigable.\" At the annual meeting (May, 1885) of the American Oriental Society at Boston, Professor Lyon gave an account of recent progress in Assyriology. Independently of German and English publications, he referred to Professor Paul Haupt's contributions to the American *Hebraica* of a valuable paper on Assyrian vowels, and of a minute commentary on the confinement at Nineveh of a Kedarene prince, related in the annals of Assurbanipal. Mention also was made of \"an entertaining and scholarly address by Professor Francis Brown\" under the title of *Assyriology: its use and abuse in Old Testament Study*. Professor Lyon's own work, entitled *An Assyrian Manual*, announced as in the press, was intended for those who wish to study the language with or without a teacher; and would contain texts partly in Cuneiform character, but mostly transliterated, together with paradigms, notes, glossary and lists of Cuneiform signs.\n\nIn the *Revue Critique* of 27th July is a notice by M. Hal\u00e9vy of Dr. Jansen's \"Dissertations\" and Dr. Zimmern's brochure mentioned in M. Bezold's resum\u00e9 which has been summarized above. He couples the last with Dr. Fritz Hommel's *Sumrisch-Akkadische Sprache*, giving as a reason that they exactly represent the three successive stages through\nwhich the Akkadian question has passed in German a year. Dr. Hommel's work will, he believes, be the forward in support of the theory of the Turanian origin of Sumerian or Akkadian language. As before shown, in the pages of this Journal (see Report for 1883, p. 1), many eminent scholars differ from this view and utterly reject the dictum of his penultimate sentence on mot, l'Accadien ou Sum\u00e9rien pur est une chim\u00e8re; trouve nulle part, parcequ'il n'a jamais exist\u00e9.\n\nBesides a note in the Hebraica on Fred. Delitzsch's of the \"Kassites\" (die Sprache der Koss\u00e4er), there is Literarisches Centralblatt of the 11th July, a laudator of the same scholar's Assyrian reading-book, described very useful and trustworthy.\n\nProfessor Sayce's \"Assyria, its Princes, Prices People,\" published by the Religious Tract Society, favourably reviewed in the Athen\u00e6um of the 15th May. While the author himself is described as an \"eminently brilliant leader in the difficult study of Assyriology,\" the small volume is pronounced to be \"instructive and remarkably interesting.\" The chapters on religion and Assyrian literature are specially selected for comment. Not the important feature to be noted with satisfaction in this but valuable publication, is the aid afforded by the Cuneiform Inscriptions to the elucidation of history.\n\nNo. III. of the Revue d'Assyriologie et d'Arch\u00e9ologie Orientale contains, among other interesting papers enumerated, one by M. Bertin on \"L'Incorporation Vendue de l'Accadien.\" The Editors take exception to the title and plea that, while admitting the term Sumerian, they doubt whether \"Akkadian\" can be applied to a dialect of Sumerian or to the Semitic language of the Assyrians; but the able and painstaking writer may be said to assert his own theories on the matter.\n\nAmong lately published works, not heretofore\nmay be noticed: \"By-paths of Bible Knowledge,\" written by Professor Sayce for the Religious Tract Society, on the Assyrians and their History: Die Annalen Asurnasirpal (B.C. 884\u2013860), from the London edition, by Heinrich Shotzky: \"Les Langues perdues de la Perse et de l'Assyrie,\" by J. M\u00e9nant: Histoire Ancienne de l'Orient jusqu'aux Guerres M\u00e9diques, tome iv., 9\u00e8me \u00e9dition: \"Les Assyriens et les Chald\u00e9ens: Aug. Vogel's \"Nach Kanaan, Tagebuch, eine Reise durch \u00c6gypten, Palastina und Griechenland\": Fr. Hommel, \"Geschichte Babyloniens und Assyriens; mit Abbildungen und Karten\": D. G. Lyon, Assyrian Study, its bearing on the Old Testament (in the Christian Year, Nos. 15 and 16): J. M\u00e9nant, Catalogue M\u00e9thodique, etc., above alluded to in M. B\u00e9zold's notice, 1\u00e8re et 2\u00e8me Livraison (deux fascicules); a beautifully printed and illustrated work: the same author's \"Recherches sur la Glyptique Orientale,\" 2nd part, Assyrian Cylinders (1886), of which the first part was published in 1883: Acta Sancti Maris Assyri\u00e6, Babylonici ac Persidis, seculo i apostoli Syriace sive Aramaice, ed. J. B. Abbeloos (reviewed by N\u00f6ldeke in the Austrian Monatsschrift f\u00fcr den Orient, October): Die Keilinschriften am Eingange der Quellengrotte d. Sebeneh-Su by E. Schrader (reviewed by M\u00fcller in the November number of the same): Assyriologische Bibliothek (vol. iv. parts 5 and 6), Delitzsch and Haupt.\n\nArabic.\u2014Some further correspondence on the \"Arabian Matriarchate\" (Journal Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. XVII. Part 2), will be found in the Academy of 4th July, where is a letter from Mr. J. W. Redhouse in reply to one from Professor E. B. Tylor, which appeared on 27th June. Writing again on 15th August, Professor Tylor mentions that Dr. G. A. Wilken has published the \"Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb\"; but, as the said publication is apparently not so accessible to English anthro-\npologists as it deserves to be, he cites some of its chief points. To this there is a rejoinder by Mr. J. W. Redhouse in the issue of 22nd August, in which he expresses the opinion that his main contention had been overlooked; and does not commit himself to any decided view on a \"conceivably historic Arabian or Semitic matriarchate.\"\n\nIn the *Academy* of the 8th August is a review by Mr. Lyall of the Arabic-English Dictionary by Dr. F. S. Beeston, commending the book, in that it furnishes students with a first time in English, with a trustworthy authority in a compact and convenient form. He points out that there is room for improvement in the classification and grouping of different significations.\n\nA long-felt want has, it is hoped, been supplied by the publication of Dr. Tien's \"Manual of Colloquial Arabic,\" noticed in the *Athen\u00e6um* of 25th July and Saturday Review of 22nd August.\n\nIn the *Journal of the German Oriental Society*, Mr. W. Robertson Smith has a note on M. Wellhausen's interpretation of the \"Lieder der Hudhailiten,\" in the preceding number of that Journal, pointing out that the hareheads on the tombs of the maidens are not metaphorical, but, without actual heads, intended as amulets and worn as bracelets.\n\nThe *Academy* of 25th July announces the issue of the *Buch Al Chidr*, by Abu'l Hasan Jehuda Hallewi, by Dr. Hartwig Eichhorn. It is published by subscription, in two parts (at the rate of five marks each), and contains the original Arabic text with Hebrew characters from the unique MS. in the Bodleian Library, also, in parallel columns, the Hebrew translation, based on Ibn Tibbon, which is preserved in five MSS. collated for the purpose, with critical notes.\n\nIn the *Oesterreichische Monatsschrift f\u00fcr den Orient* of June and July are two long notices by Dr. Ign. Goldziher on \"Aben Pascualis Assila\" (dictionarium Biographicum).\ncodicis Escurialensis Arabice nunc primum edidit et indicibus locupletissimis instruxit Franciscus Codera. The reviewer welcomes the appearance of Ibn Bashkuw\u00e2l\u2019s (A.H. 494-578) Biographies as evidence of the progress in Spain in the region of Oriental studies. The work forms the first two volumes of a Bibliotheca Arabica-Hispana, on the continuation of which Signor Codera gives a short programme in the preface. The editor, who is Professor of Arabic in the University of Madrid, has already acquired considerable reputation by his works on the history, numismatics, etc., of Muhammadan Spain. To these must now be added the present publication, a source of Spanish-Arabic literary history from the 4th to the 6th century of the Hegira. Ibn Bashkuw\u00e2l\u2019s work, in continuation of that of Ibn al Farad\u00ee to his own time, is again continued by Ibn Al Abb\u00e2r, and Abu\u2019l Hasan Haz\u00eem of Carthagena. In editing this curious and instructive book, Signor Codera has rendered a service to Oriental science which merits acknowledgment. Although the reviewer indicates that the edition is in some respects inadequate in satisfying philological requirements, he bears evidence to the fact that much very learned information is conveyed in the 1440 biographical notices which it places before the reader. Three indices are appended, one topographical, one biographical, and one bibliographical. On the completion of the \u201cBibliotheca,\u201d it is intended to supply a general biographical index covering the whole of the names therein contained. Such a task, if well performed, would afford welcome aid to students of Arabic literature. The third volume of the \u201cBibliotheca Arabica-hispana,\u201d by M.M. Codera and Ribera, has also been issued. Its title is \u201cDesiderium Querentis historiam virorum populi Andalusiae auctore Adh-Dhabb\u00e9. Ad fidem codicis Escorialiensis Arabice nunc primum ediderunt Franc. Codera et Jul. Ribera.\u201d 8vo. Madrid, 1885.\n\nIn the Literarisches Centralblatt, No. 26 of 20th, June, is a notice of the \u201cSaadia Al-Faj\u00fbm\u00ee, Arabische Psalmen-\n\u00fcbersetzung, nach einer M\u00fcnchener Handschrift herau und in Deutsche \u00fcbertragen,\u201d von Dr. S.

Mis Mecque; Bugeaud en Afrique\u201d; a work also n the Saturday Review of 4th July.\n\nAmong books issued during the past year may be mentioned \u201cTranslations of Ancient Arabian Poeti Prae-Islamic,\u201d by Charles J. Lyall. Reviews of th appear both in the Academy and Athen\u00e6um of October. The first, bearing the well-known sig R. F. Burton, gives ready testimony to the tr exceptional scholarship, but does not find in his t that most rare of all rarities in renderings from texts, the \u201cpeculiar cachet of the original.\u201d Bur words immediately following this expression are v repetition, not only from their characteristic force show the difficulty of the task signified: \u201cThis Oriental poetry is spirit-stirring as a trumpet sou the words be thin. It is heady as the golden Libanus, which tastes like water and is potent as the clear contrary of our nineteenth-century style.\nbe represented only by the verse of the old English ballad, or by the prose of the Book of Job.\" From the review in the *Athen\u00e6um*, the concluding passage may be taken to express the general opinion entertained of Mr. Lyall's great merits: \"The book is replete with novel and valuable materials for the student of poetry, and we do not doubt it will receive the hearty welcome which so original, scholarly, and charming a collection deserves.\" There may also be noted: R. Dvorak, \"Ueber die Fremdw\u00f6rter in Kor\u00e2n\"\u2014\"Ibn Ginn\u00fb,\" de flexione libellus, arabice nunc primum editum in latinum sermonem transtulit, notis illustravit Godfredus Hoburg. H.

Foreign systems of transliterating Arabic must, unfortunately, be perplexing; a truth self-evident to the Englishman, who has experienced the difficulty experienced by his countrymen in adopting an uniform system for themselves.\n\nTwo publications by Brill of Leiden merit remark. Geographie der Arabischen Halbinsel of Abu Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24asan bin A\u1e25mad bin Ya\u1e33\u016bb bin Yusuf bin D\u0101w\u016bd Bakr, and the Kitabu 'l Baldan of Abi Bakr A\u1e25mad Muhammad al Hanadani.\n\nSamaritan.\u2014Dr. Kohn, in his review of the first volume of the Bibliotheca Samaritana, noticed in our last report, and again mentioned this year among the contents of the Z.D.M.G. vol. xxxix. pt. 2, points out that the fragment of Samaritan which has survived the lapse of centuries has not received the attention which it demands. Of the Samaritan literature still extant, but a very small portion is accessible, while in respect to the numerous MSS. which lie inedited in the Libraries of Oxford, St. Petersburg, Berlin, etc., not only the contents, but even the existence is scarcely known. The Bibliotheca Samaritana of Dr. Kohn should remedy this manifest deficiency. It is contemplated periodical issue in the Hebrew Square of London, with the requisite Introduction, Notes and Supplements, should supply a series of valuable texts, and must contribute to the thorough elucidation not only of the history, but also of the language and religious and spiritual life of the Samaritans.\n\nIn conclusion, Dr. Kohn regards the Bibliotheca Samaritana as the light of a praiseworthy undertaking; but he holds that, if it is to promote the study of Samaritan, it must be completed with more attention to grammatical precision, accuracy, and more systematic and scholarly supervision than hitherto evinced. The second volume of the Bibliotheca Samaritana has recently been published.\nHittite.\u2014Notwithstanding certain specific objections to some of the author's conclusions, Dr. Francis Brown's criticism of the \"Empire of the Hittites,\" in vol. i. of the American Journal of Archaeology, admits that Dr. Wright's book \"opens a new and attractive field to the general reader, and will be welcome to those who are concerned for the historical accuracy of the Old Testament.\" He further points out the strong evidence that there was once a large and formidable population between the Middle Euphrates and Orontes, with some kind of natural organization, to which the Assyrians gave the name of Chatti . . . and that the \"Chittites\"\u2014A.V. Hittites\u2014of the Bible present the same name in a very slightly modified form.\n\nSyriac.\u2014The Athen\u00e6um, 13th June, states that there is in the press a Neo-Syriac (dialect of Salam\u0101s) translation of Thomas \u00e0 Kempis by Father B\u00e9djan. In the Academy of the 20th June is Capt. (Sir Richard) Burton's review of \"Kalilah and Dimnah, or the Fables of Bidpai, being an account of their literary history, with an English Translation of the later Syriac version of the same and Notes,\" by J. G. N. Keith-Falconer. The eighth Essay in the \"Studia Biblica\" is a careful study by Dr. Gwilliam of a Syriac version of Saint Matthew and Saint Mark in the Tattam collection.\n\nThe advertised course on Semitic languages at the Johns Hopkins University comprises no less than thirteen series of Lectures for advanced students, among them being one each for Syriac, Aramaean, Ethiopic, Babylonian, Akkadian and Sumerian.\n\nAt the May meeting of the American Oriental Society in Boston (1885), Professor Hall reported receipt of a letter from Professor Albert Long, intimating that he had found a fragment of a Syriac MS. of the Gospels, containing a portion of St. Luke. It was not Peshitto, but in the style-\nof the Harklensian version. He had also received\nof fragments of Syrian MSS. from the Rev.

Dr. F. Kielhorn's \"Pr\u0101k\u1e5bitw\u00f6rte in Mah\u0101bh\u0101shya\":\u2014the writer observes that a few Prakrit words are known to exist in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101shya, but the more interesting of these do not appear to have hitherto received any attention.\n\nIn the Oesterreichsche Monatsschrift f\u00fcr den Orient for May and June, 1885, Professor George B\u00fchler, of Vienna, reviews at length \"A Second Report in Search of Sanskrit MSS. in the Bombay Circle.\" Like the former report, he considers it to be replete with matter both interesting and instructive; and he remarks that Dr. Petersen can render a very great service to his colleagues if he will see that all the Sanskrit anthologies are printed. In the number for July Professor B\u00fchler speaks in high terms of Professor Jolly's \"Tagore Law Lectures,\" a work useful to the general student of Sanskrit, and the first attempt to trace in a comprehensive manner the historical development of some of the most interesting topics of the Hindu Law. His confirmation of the discovery that the so-called Brihat or Vriddha Manu was a later recension of Bh\u1e5bigu's Samhit\u0101, deprives of its foundation the former opinion that \"our Manu must be later than the fifth century, because its predecessor, the Vriddha Manu, enumerated the signs of the Zodiac.\" In the number for August, Dr. Rudolf Meringer reviews the first volume of M. A. Bergaigne's \"Etudes sur le Lexique du Rigveda,\" and trusts that the appearance of his work will have the effect of giving fresh impetus to the discussion of questions connected with this particular subject.\n\nIn the Deutsche Literaturzeitung, No. 23, \"The Sankhya Aphorisms of Kapila, with Illustrative Extracts from the Commentaries,\" translated by Dr. Ballantyne, 3rd edition, is reviewed by M. Deussen, who considers it to be the best work on the subject. In No. 29 M. Garbe reviews \"La Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e de la Bhagavadgit, \u00e9tudi\u00e9e en elle m\u00eame et dans ses origines,\" par Ph. Colinet, which he considers well done, though diffuse;\nand in No. 30 is a review of Prof. Edgren's Sanskrit (which is said to be based essentially upon Whitney's) pointing its isolated faults, but behind it in exactness of correctness of printing.\n\nAt the annual meeting of the American Oriental Society in Boston, on the 6th May, 1885, Professor Hopkins gave reasons for dissenting from Burnell's argument in regard to the date of the Manara-dharma-sutra. We can, thinks, judge the age of the work by its latest portion; have no grounds for narrowing the date to the Pulike\u00e7i I. Professor Whitney concurred in this view further alluded to his own work on \"Numerical Results Indexes of Sanskrit Tense and Conjugation Stems,\" through the press; described its character, and gave examples of the statistics of classification he had adopted. Lanman continued the discussion, and took occasion to show a Sanskrit manuscript of a Hindu treatise on Logic, which came into his hands since the October meeting. A paper by Professor Edgren, of the Nebraska University, on the Tum-class in Sanskrit was presented by Professor Professor M. Bloomfield, of Baltimore, remarked Vedic derivatives of the root pr\u0101c \"ask,\" hitherto unnoted, and referred to the respective translations of the hymn by Weber, Ludwig, and Grill as missing the original.\n\nThe Academy of the 6th June quotes from the Chicago University Reporter, Mr. Cecil Bendall's preliminary report on his tour in Northern India in the previous year in search of Sanskrit MSS. In its issue of the 29th June we are told that among those collected in Nepal is a leaf copy of N\u0101rada written in A.D. 1407, which contains an entirely new recension of that law-giver's code. The title of the work, M\u0101nara ny\u0101ya \u0101\u015brama N\u0101rada proktam, confirms the Indian tradition as to its connection with the celebrated Institutes of Manu. Mr. Bendall has\nMS. to Professor Jolly of W\u00fcrzburg, who is printing the text. The *Athen\u00e6um* of the 15th August, 1885, notifies that Mr. Cecil Bendall, Fellow of Caius College, Cambridge, and in charge of the Oriental Books at the British Museum, has accepted the post of Professor of Sanskrit at University College, London.\n\nPart I. of the Catalogue of the Old Collection of Sanskrit MSS. in the Library of Deccan College, issued during the past year, was prepared under the superintendence of Professor F. Kielhorn, and Part II. with Index by Prof. R. G. Bhandarkar.\n\nOn the authority of the *Academy*, we learn that in the course of last year, Mr. Anundoram Borooah, Officiating Magistrate and Collector, was preparing for the press a critical edition of the Amarakosa, to which end he had borrowed a large number of MSS. from various quarters, among them the entire Kosa Collection of the India Office, which is probably the richest that any library can boast. Subject to receiving substantial support, he intended to issue a cheap edition of the text, with the commentaries of Xirasvami and Rayamukuta in full, and material extracts from all other important commentaries.\n\nThe *Academy* of July 4 notices an interesting monograph by Dr. Von Brandke on *Dy\u0101us Asura, Ahura-Mazd\u0101 und die Asuras*, the aim of which is to show, by passages from the Rig-Veda and other works, the true signification of *Asura*.\n\nThe *Academy* of July 11 publishes the Latin diploma of the University of G\u00f6ttingen, conferring the degrees of Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy upon Prof. Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, of the Deccan College, Bombay. This is an honourable recognition of the learned Professor's high proficiency in the ancient languages of India. Professor Bhandarkar has long been an Honorary Member of the London Royal Asiatic Society, and is an important con-\ntributor to the number of the Journal of the Branch, noticed in p. LXXI ante.\n\nIn reviewing \"The Ordinances of Manu,\" translated from Sanskrit, with an Introduction by the late A. C. Hume, the Athen\u00e6um of June 6, 1885, states that the translation is a work of sound scholarship and accurate knowledge of Indian law, which qualify him in an eminent degree for the undertaking. He had only however reached the beginning of the second lecture when failing health compelled him to lay aside his pen, and for the remaining five lectures we are indebted to Dr. E. W. Hopkins. It is added that a happier choice of an editor could not have been made, that Dr. Hume had cordially entered into the scheme of the translation originally devised, and had ably supplemented Dr. Hopkins' annotations left incomplete at his death.\n\nThe Athen\u00e6um of June 13 contains an interesting communication from Professor Max M\u00fcller, furnishing information regarding the existence of the \"Horiuzi Palm Leaves\" in Japan, in which year they are spoken of with reference to former history. In the 4th and 18th July and 8th August numbers a discussion is carried on between Professors Max M\u00fcller and Beal as to the value of the historical and paleographical evidence of the high antiquity assigned to these leaves. G. B\u00fchler, C.I.E., contributes a note on this subject in the Indian Antiquary for August, intimating that a second palm-leaf MS. had been newly discovered in Japan by Bunyiu Nanjio. It is but a single fragment, but of high importance for Indian Palaeography. The leaves are Buddhistic and probably belong to one of the earlier Sutras. Short as the piece is, it furnishes several new words not hitherto found in Sanskrit dictionaries.\n\nThe Athen\u00e6um of 11th July mentions that the recent publication of the \"Anecdota Oxoniensia (Aryan Series),\" then announced, would contain the \"Dharmasamgraha,\" a dictionary of Buddhist technical terms. The materials were\nby Kenyiu Kasawara, one of the Buddhist priests who came from Japan to Oxford to study Sanskrit, and who died soon after his return to Japan. Prof. Max M\u00fcller, assisted by Dr. Wenzel, the well-known Tibetan scholar, who has been resident at Oxford for several years, had superintended the work when passing through the press. It contains copious notes and indices.\n\nProf. George B\u00fchler writes to the Academy of 15th August giving a short description of a Saurayantra belonging to Mr. Whitley Stokes, which, being of good execution, and apparently some antiquity\u2014perhaps between 300 and 400 years\u2014he deems worthy of notice. This tablet was probably used in worshipping the sun, just as the Bhaumayantra in the adoration of the planet Mars. Edgren\u2019s \u201cCompendious Sanskrit Grammar, with a brief sketch of Scenic Prakrit,\u201d being No. xiii. of Tr\u00fcbner\u2019s Simplified Grammars, is commended in the Literarisches Centralblatt of the 24th October. Reviews of the same work, both in the main favourable, had before appeared in the Academy of 11th and Athen\u00e6um of 25th July. So also Jolly\u2019s \u201cOutlines of an History of the Hindu Law of Partition, Inheritance, and Adoption, as contained in the original Sanskrit treatises,\u201d is again favourably noticed in the Deutsche Litteraturzeitung of the 14th November. In the Academy of January 9 is a letter from Professor Max M\u00fcller stating that he is not aware any Sanskrit scholar had ever referred the date of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a to later than the 7th century A.D., but as regards that century the testimony of Subandhu was available. The same paper of the 13th February, referring to Sanskrit study in Benares, mentions that the Pr\u0101ti\u015b\u0101khya of the White Yajurveda with Uvata\u2019s Commentary; Bhartrihari\u2019s Vakyapadiya; Tantrav\u0101rttika, the great M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 work of Kum\u0101rilabhatta; and Pras\u0101tap\u0101dabh\u0101shya, the oldest commentary on the Vai\u015be\u1e63hika-s\u016btras, are in progress in the local series. Other items of literary interest in connection with the above-mentioned city\nare also given. The Academy of the 13th March carried notice by Professor Max M\u00fcller of Oriental translation of the National Anthem; including one by Professor Weber, which added lines to the old and well-known verse. One objection to these is that they deviate from the rhyme metre of the original, an objection to which Captain Murray has something to say in reply in the next week's issue. We learn from the same source that the Executive Committee of the University had decided to discontinue the Chair of Sanskrit and Modern Oriental Languages, occupied for 17 years by Professor Roehrig. In the philology notes of the journal of April 10th we learn that Dr. Bechtlingk's Sanskrit Dictionary was near completion, and that the same author was about to re-edit Panini's Grammar. The number contains a careful review of Whitney's Root Forms, etc., a work already mentioned. Mr. Cecil's instructive and elaborately-illustrated volume described as \"Journey of Literary and Arch\u00e6ological Researches in Southern and Northern India,\" will be welcome, not only to students, but to Sanskrit scholars and connoisseurs in India. It is brief, but full of information well tabulated together, and supplements the previous items of Sanskrit information received on the subject.\n\nAmong books recently published in Sanskrit, or translated into Sanskrit, may be mentioned:\u2014R\u0101ja\u00e7ekhara Pracanda's K\u0101la Drama.

Also German translations of the same book by H. Zimmer.\n\nVol. xxvi. of the Sacred Books of the East contains part 2, or books iii. and iv., of the Satapatha Brahmana, translated by Professor Eggeling, of which the former part, or books i. and ii. appeared in vol. xii. of this remarkable series.\n\nAn article headed \u201cTranslations of the Rig Veda,\u201d which appeared in the Athen\u00e6um of the 6th February last, is short but suggestive. It refers to the increasing popularity which Vedic Literature, and more particularly the Rig Veda itself, has acquired among native students. An edition of the latter, begun at Rombay in 1876, with both a Marathi and English translation; Dayananda Sarasvati\u2019s edition, with translations and commentary in Sanskrit and Hindi; and the first volume of a quite recent Bengali translation by Mr. R. C. Dutt, of the\nBengal Civil Service\u2014all these bear testimony to the attention given to this branch of study to the present generation of scholars.\n\nP\u0101li.\u2014In the Academy of the 19th September 1885, Morris writes that all who take an interest in P\u0101li and Buddhist Literature will hail the appearance of the excellent and carefully-edited text of the Sutta Pitaka which had just been issued by the P\u0101li Text Society. The Journal of the Society for the same year, and part 1, Sagatha-Vagga, of the Suttas of the Nik\u0101ya of the Sutta-Pitaka, edited by M. L\u00e9on Feer, has also been published. In vol. xx. of the \"Sacred Books of the East\" are Vinaya texts, translated from the original P\u0101li by T. W. Rhys Davids and Hermann Oldenberg.\n\nM\u00fcller's Simplified Grammar of the P\u0101li Language is reviewed in a lengthy notice in the Literatur-Blatt for October\u2014It appeared in 1885. This is one of the issues of Tr\u00fcbner's Sanskrit Grammar Series edited by Dr. Rost. It is also commented on in the Academy of the 3rd October, where it is stated that, notwithstanding some shortcomings, it is the best P\u0101li Grammar now obtainable in any European language.\n\nPr\u0101krit.\u2014Vol. xxii. of the Sacred Books of the East contains the \"Gaina Sutras. Translated from Pr\u0101krit by H. H. Wilson. Part I. Ak\u0101r\u0101nga Sutra; the Kalpa Sutra.\"\n\nSinhalese.\u2014The Athen\u00e6um of 25th July noted the publication of the Catalogue of P\u0101li, Sinhalese and Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Temple Libraries of Ceylon,\" recently printed at the Government Press, Colombo. The Mah\u0101 Mudaliyar de Zoysa, Government translator, who had for many years been engaged on its compilation, unfortunately died before completion of his work. He was a Sinhalese scholar of high linguistic attainments, and a frequent contributor to the Royal Asiatic Society.\nto the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Colombo. As far back as the autumn of 1875 he had reported to the Government of the island on the results of his inspection of the temple libraries. In the present publication those results are classified in all their details under appropriate heads: but a last section, to have been reserved for works of a miscellaneous kind, was not ready for the press at the author's death, and the Catalogue is so far incomplete. In its present state, however, it is a valuable contribution to our knowledge of P\u0101li and Sinhalese literature.\n\nWe gather from the Academy of the 29th August that Shakspere is in favour with the natives of Ceylon, for whose benefit the Two Gentlemen of Verona has been translated, with the addition of verses to be sung in chorus in the Sinhalese stage adaptation.\n\nPahlavi.\u2014Vol. xxiv. of the Sacred Books of the East contains the third part of Dr. West's Pahlavi Texts, of which the previous parts are in vols. v. and xviii. It consists of the Din\u00e2\u00ee Main\u00f4g-i-Khirad, or Opinions of the Spirit of Wisdom; the Sikand G\u00fbm\u00e2n\u00eek Vig\u00e2r, or the doubt-dispelling explanation; and the Sad Dar, or hundred subjects.\n\nZend.\u2014A curious dissertation on the words agaretem qaren\u00f4 (sic), interpreted as the majesty, or happy state of the just, leading on to the definition of other expressions in the Avesta, is to be found in the Mus\u00e9on of August, 1885, and is from the pen of Professor E. Wilhelm of the Jena University.\n\nIn the Literatur-Blatt, No. iv. of the second volume or last quarter of 1885, is a notice of the first part of Karl Geldner's Avesta, which promises, by the great care taken in compiling and collating, to supply the deficiencies of previous editions, and to merit the thanks of all Zend students.\n\nUnder the title of \"Civilization of the Eastern Iranians in\nancient times, with an Introduction on the Religio Avesta,\" Mr. D\u0101r\u0101b Dastur Peshotan Sanj\u0101n\u0101, B.A., of the German Oriental Society, has completed a translation of Dr. Wilhelm Geiger's Ostiranische Kultur im Avesta, lately published by Frowde.\n\nPersian.\u2014M. James Darmesteter's inaugural lecture at Coll\u00e8ge de France last year, under the designation of Conf\u00e9rence sur la histoire de la Perse, has been published, as well as a clever paper on the Mahdi, in the \"Biblioth\u00e8que d'Elz\u00e9virienne.\" No. 41 of the series is \"Les Perdus de la Perse et de l'Assyrie. I. Perse,\" by M\u00e9nant.\n\nThe Academy of September 5 states that Mr. Wollaston's Complete English-Persian Dictionary is in advanced state of preparation; that it will appear in quarto volume of about one thousand pages; but that notwithstanding a grant in aid from the Secretary of State, publishers appeal to Oriental Societies, and in particular interested in Persian, to subscribe for copies to defray cost of publication.\n\nMr. Finn's Persian for Travellers is said by the reviewer in the Academy of the 26th September to be a welcome addition to our word-books for \"all scholars who are anxious for any addition to the materials now existing for a dictionary of the living language of Iran.\" He objects, as the Athen\u00e6um had done before, to the transcription which has been followed for Anglicizing words.\n\nMr. Sidney Churchill has a short paper in the Academy of December 19, on the Matla'u'th-Shams, vol. ii. issued by the Tehran Press by the Saniu'd-daulah. It is an account of the city of Mash-had and its notabilia.\n\nA second edition of Palmer's Simplified Grammar of Hindustani, Persian and Arabic, and the first vol.\nDictionnaire Fran\u00e7ais-Persan, by J. B. Nicolas, A\u2014K, are reported available. In the Recueil des textes relatifs \u00e0 l'histoire des Seljoucides, par M. Th. Houtsma, vol. i., \"Histoire des Seljoucides du Kerman par Muhammad Ibrahim,\" has been quite recently published by Brill.\n\nThe second volume of M. Schefer's Chrestomathie Persane for the use of the pupils at the Ecole Sp\u00e9ciale des Langues Orientales Vivantes, belongs to that class of publications which the industrious and able author knows so well how to prepare. The only flaw is one which may be rather apparent to the eye of an English than a Continental critic; and that is, the diminutive character of the Persian type.\n\n\"Notes of a Journey from Kasvin to Hamadan, across the Karaghan Country,\" is the title of a lately published volume (Madras, 1885), in which Mr. J. D. Rees, Under Secretary to Government, describes his personal experience of Persia. In a literary point of view its official form hardly does justice to so promising a launch into the world of letters. The book is favourably noticed in the Athen\u00e6um of February 27th, and has met with like welcome in other periodicals.\n\nThe Messrs. Scribner, of New York, have issued a new volume entitled \"Persia, the Land of the Im\u00e1ms,\" by Mr. James Basset, a Missionary of the Presbyterian Board. His narrative extends over a period of fourteen years, or from 1871 to 1885. That part of it which relates to Urm\u00eda and the country between Urm\u00eda and Hamadan will, perhaps, be the most attractive to readers of travel, as it is less known than the author's routes from Tehran to Mashhad on one side, and to Bushahr on the other, which have been repeatedly traversed and described by Englishmen.\n\nVol. i. part i. of the Umdatu't Taw\u00e1rikh, in Persian, by Lala Sohan Lal, to be completed in eight volumes, has been announced among Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner's new Oriental publications. It is edited in English by Captain R. C. Temple.\n\nThe \"Trois Com\u00e9dies traduites du Dialecte Turc Azeri en\nPersian par Mirza Dja'far et publi\u00e9es d'apr\u00e8s l'ed Tehr\u00e2n avec un Glossaire et des Notes\" forms an little volume for which students of Persian are indebt Barbier de Meynard and the late Stanislas Guyard. more proficient, the Tehran edition itself is preferable the stamp of genuineness, both in binding and type, a trace of the European printer or publisher. The \"comedies\" in the French are all to be found in the edition; and indeed other dramatic sketches also.\n\nBaluchi.\u2014The Reverend Arthur Lewis' \"Baluchi in the language spoken by the nomad tribes of the Hills, was noticed in the Academy of June 6, 1885 were recommended as likely to interest both the p and student of folk-lore; and, having been taken do the lips of the Panj\u00e1b Frontier Baluchis, are und genuine. Translations are attached.\n\nBrahui.\u2014A contribution to the Asiatic Society by Dr. Th. Duka promises to throw additional ligh study of this language, which Mr. Cust has clas Pashtu, to represent the Iranian branch of the Aryan It will appear in January.\n\nUrdu.\u2014Mr. Platts has done good service by his pu of the Dictionary of Urdu, Classical Hindi and Engl his work has met with the favour which it merit hands of the reviewer. The commendation given the Athen\u00e6um of the 20th June (1885) is not merely it applies to the book in detail and on given grounds can scarcely be two opinions on the proposition Hindustani lexicographer should be without a comple ledge of Persian, and, as a natural consequence, o Arabic phraseology which forms part and parcel of the Iranian tongue.\" And it is satisfactory to learn t\ncondition \"is fulfilled in an excellent way by Mr. Platts, who is as competent in the one language as in the other.\"\n\nBengali.\u2014We learn that the first part of an Encyclopaedic dictionary in Bengali, edited by two native scholars, has been published in India. It contains descriptive derivations of Sanskrit and Bengali words with Sutras quoted from Panini the grammarian; Arabic, Persian and Hindi words introduced into the Bengali language; notes on the ancient and modern religious beliefs of India, the Vedas, Pur\u00e1ns, Tantras and other sacred books; besides short articles embracing the whole range of modern science. A grammar of the language, by Mr. J. F. Blumhardt, of the British Museum, has been notified as in preparation. Mr. H. A. D. Philips has published Kopul Kundala, a Tale of Bengali life, translated from the Bengali of Bunkim Chandra Chatterjee.\n\nBih\u00e2r\u00ee.\u2014The Academy of the 20th June last year has much to say with reference to the first part of the Comparative Dictionary of the Bih\u00e2r\u00ee Language, on which Dr. Hoernle and Mr. G. A. Grierson had been for long engaged. Opposite the title-page are four maps showing the progress of the language from the old Prakrit of B.c. 500 to the Bih\u00e2r\u00ee dialects of the present day. The part comprises an introduction of fifty pages, containing an exposition of the system of transliteration and spelling adopted by the editors, and other necessary details; forty pages of dictionary proper, and ten pages of the promised Index to the R\u00e2m\u00e2y\u00e1n of Tul\u2019s\u00ee D\u00e3s. Although nominally a dictionary of the Bih\u00e2r\u00ee language, it deals scientifically with all the Aryan languages of India, from Sindhi on the extreme west, to Assamese on the extreme east. According to the \"Calcutta Englishman,\" it would be impossible to convey any idea of the diligence and erudition displayed by Dr. Hoernle and Mr. Grierson upon a subject apparently so uninviting. A glance\nat the list of philological works laid under contribu\nbe enough to convince the reader of the wide and\ncharacter of the authors' investigations. Another i\nthe Dictionary is in the Austrian Monatsschrift f\u00fcr de\nfor December.\n\nMr. Grierson has also published parts i. to iv. of\nGrammars of the Dialects and Sub-dialects of th\nLanguage,\" compiled under the orders of the Gover\nBengal. They are thus arranged:\u2014I. Introductio\nmap. II. Bhojpuri dialect of Shahabad, Saran, Ch\nNorth Muzaffarpur and the Eastern portion of N.W. P\nIII. Magadhi dialect of South Patna and Gaya. IV\nBhojpuri dialect of Central and South Muzaffarpur\ngentleman's work on \"Bihar Peasant Life\" is rep\ninformation of great value to scholars and genera\nis a worthy specimen of the resources of the Bengal S\nPress, and cannot fail to enhance the already high r\nof its author.\n\nThe Homeward Mail of 6th July says that a choi\nture of vernacular Bengali has been called into ex\nlate years and that the province of Bihar has gained\nliterary distinction. Foremost among the pioneers o\nis noted the Khadga Vilas Press at Bangkipur, whic\nsends forth work after work in Hindi, each stead\nin the scale of improvement. As an instance is\nBh\u0101sti\u0101-S\u016bra, or a selection from the best writers i\nin the first part of which are specimens from L\nR\u0101j\u0101 Siva Prasad, B\u0101b\u016b Harischandra, Sri Giridh\nRama Tiwari and B\u0101b\u016b Gad\u0101dhara, all of whom ha\ntheir mark in the vernacular of the North. The\nwapradip is cited as an excellent work on physical g\nby Munshi R\u0101m Prakash Lal, while the Mah\u0101r\u0101\nis a dramatic version of part of the Bh\u0101gavata P\nL\u0101l Khadga Bah\u0101dur Malla.\nAssamese.\u2014The Athen\u00e6um, 26th September, notes a remarkable revival of linguistical research in Assam, mainly due to the enlightened zeal of Mr. E. Stack, of the Shillong Secretariat. The \"Outline Grammar of the Kachari Language,\" by the Rev. S. Endle, has been succeeded by a \"Short Account of the Kachchar Naga Tribe, with an Outline Grammar, Vocabulary and Illustrative Sentences,\" by Mr. C. A. Soppitt, a young officer in administrative charge of the North Kachar Hills. The Kachcha Nagas live west of the Angami Nagas, between these and the Khasis; their language has affinities with Mikir and Kachari. The same gentleman is now engaged upon a Kuki grammar, while Mr. Needham's \"Abor Grammar\" is in type, and Mr. MacCabe's \"Angami Naga Grammar\" ready for the press. The last-named language is, in spite of its tribal designation, quite different from the Kachcha Naga, and is a tonic tongue. Mr. Stack himself is working up his materials towards a grammatical account of the Bhutia Changlo dialect, and is likewise preparing from his rich collectanea a grammar and phrase book of Mikir. The Athen\u00e6um further states that, by order of the Assam Secretariat, Mr. Soppitt has recently printed \"A Historical and Descriptive Account of the Kachari Tribes in the North Cachar Hills, with Specimens of Tales and Folk-lore.\" The history of the Kacharis, who number upwards of 400,000 souls, cannot be traced further back than the beginning of the 14th century. Mention is also made of Mr. C. J. Lyall's able Census Report for Assam; the dictionary of the Garo language under preparation by the American Missionaries at Tura, and the proposed publication of Major Macgregor's \"Notes on the Singphos and their language.\"\n\nAt the Boston May meeting of the American Oriental Society, Prof. Avery analyzed and illustrated the character of the said Garo. He described the language to be one of a numerous and loosely affiliated group of tongues known as Tibeto-Burman; its nearest kindred being the Pani-koch, the\nKachari, the Deori-Chutia, and the Tipura. Reduced by American Baptist missionaries some twenty years ago, the character used was the Bengali. The local government was printing a Tipura vocabulary, and grammars of the Miri were preparing.\n\nBurmese.\u2014Among the papers read at last year's meeting of the American Philological Association at Yale was one on the Tibeto-Burman group of languages, by Professor John F. Brunswicke. It is stated that a Burmese translation of W. W. Hunter's \"Brief History of the Indian Peninsula\" has been published at Rangoon. The Jardine Prize essay on \"The Sources and Development of Burmese Law,\" covering the period of the first introduction of Indian Law to Burma during the British occupation of Pegu,\" by Dr. E. Forchhammer, has been published. Of three books on Burma reviewed in the Athen\u00e6um of May 1st, Mr. Scott's \"Burma as it is,\" Mr. Scott's \"Burma as it will be,\" and Mr. Grattan Geary's \"Burma Conquest, viewed in its Political, Social, and Commercial Aspects from Mandalay,\" are likely to interest the reader, the first as the work of a specially qualified authority on his subject, the second as that of a pleasant and enterprising writer. Mr. Gray's \"Ancient Proverbs and Maxims from Burmese Sources; or the Niti Literature of Burma,\" is calculated to draw the attention of specialists.\n\nDravidian Languages.\u2014Tamil\u2014Telugu.\u2014Dr. P. T. Sastri has been appointed as Teacher of Tamil and Telugu at Oxford, in recognition of the reverend gentleman's publications. Formerly warden of the Bishop Cotton College at Bangalore, he has written standard books on the language and literature of Southern India, and has contributed to the proceedings of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nThe Academy of October 3rd, in criticizing M. Sastri's \"Notes on Aryan and Dravidian Philology,\"\nout that, while the writer's linguistic attainments are exceptionally great, he has failed to make his book useful from want of philological experience and proper guidance.\n\nMalto.\u2014In noticing the \"Introduction to the Malto Language and Vocabulary,\" compiled and published by the Rev. E. Droese, senior Missionary of the Church Missionary Society at Bhagulpur, N.W.P., the Academy of August 8th remarks that Malto is the language of the Paharis or people on the tops of the hills in the Santal country, who call themselves Maler (men). It possesses a philological interest as being generally considered the most northerly offshoot of the Dravidian family of speech prevalent in Southern India. Mr. Droese, while recognizing Dravidian elements, e.g. the pronouns and the first two numerals, indicates many essential particulars in which it differs from the Dravidian type. His work is mentioned by Bishop Caldwell to be a very valuable contribution to our knowledge of the Non-Aryan languages of India. Although there are native Maler Christians, there is at present no Maler missionary, but the gospels and a few hymns have been translated into Malto.\n\nChinese.\u2014The first part of the translation by M. P. L. F. Philastre of the Le Yi King, or book of the revolutions of the Tsheou Dynasty, has been received by the Royal Asiatic Society, and is a worthy issue (vol. viii.) of the Annales du Mus\u00e9e Guimet, published by the never-tiring and never-failing Ernest Leroux.\n\nParts 3 and 4 of the first volume of the Netherlands-Chinese Dictionary, by Dr. G. Schlegel, have been published by Brill at Leyden in the complete form for which that house is so remarkable.\n\nAccording to a review of Dr. Beal's translation of the \"Si-Yu-Ki, a Buddhist Record of the Western World, by Hiuen Tsiang (A.D. 629),\" in the Academy of the 12th\nSeptember, by Mr. T. W. Rhys-Davids, the resu\nnew effort in the cause of research will probably be\nbe of the greatest permanent value of all the t\nself-sacrificing labours.\n\n\"The Chinese painted by themselves\" is the\nlittle book, published in the summer of last year,\nthe account of the institutions and manners of the\nnative country is stated by the Academy (July\n\"well worth reading.\" It is a translation from th\nof Col. Tcheng-ki-Tong, Military Attach\u00e9 of the\nEmbassy in Paris, reviewed in the original in the\n26th July, 1884.

Hunter, \"Bits of Old\nE. J. Dukes, \"Scenes along river and road in the\nEmpire\" (for the Religious Tract Society); and\ncidentally mentioned in the notices of reviews and se\n\nThe Athen\u00e6um of 19th October, in reviewing\nTaoist Texts, considers that his selection of the co\nof L\u00fc Tsu as a basis for translation of the \"Taou-tih\nBible of the Taoists, while imparting interest to\nrenders it in some sense unsatisfactory.\n\nAnnamite: Cochin-China.\u2014Two admirably-printe\n(the second in two parts) have been issued by I\nthe \u00c9cole des Langues Vivantes, entitled Kim van Kieu T\u00ean Truyen, the translation of an Annamite Poem by Nguyen Du, Hitou tam tri of the Ministry of Rites in the reign of Gia long. The style of the poet is said to be Tonquinese, and the translator received one of the copies from which he prepared his text direct from Tonquin. Roman characters are placed on corresponding pages to those of the French version, which contains many graceful and charming lines.\n\nThe \"Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Acad\u00e9mique Indo-Chinoise de France,\" second series, vol. ii. (1882-3), has been issued, and has many papers of archaeological, scientific, and general interest. It opens with an analysis of Inscriptions Khmers (Kamboj) and Inscriptions Qhiames de l'ancien Ciampa.\n\nThe ably-conducted periodical which records the progress of research in Cochin-China under the title of \"Excursions et Reconnaissances\" has in its May-June number (1885) four main articles:\u20141. Historical Reminiscences of Saigon and its Environs, by M. Tru'ong Vinh K'y. 2. An Inscription on a statue of Siwa, discovered in a forest which covers the site of the old city of Kampheng Phet, by M. Schmitt. 3. Annamite Tales and Legends, by M. Landes (continued). 4. Notes on the Fish of Lower Cochin-China and Kamboj. In July-August, it has Notes on Annam (Binh Thuan), by M. Aymonier, and a sketch of the Province of Battambang\u2014a contribution, the second part of which appears in January-February, 1886. There is, also, in this last-named issue, a continuation of the Annamite tales and legends; the account of a Siamese inscription at Bangkok, by M. Schmitt, and an Annamite dialogue, \"Bonze et Bonzesse,\" translated from the original by M. Ch\u00e9on.\n\nChina Review.\u2014Mr. E. H. Parker has two articles in No. 5 (March and April, 1885), one of a controversial nature and\none composed of extracts from the \"P\u00e9i-w\u00e9n-y\u00fcn-Fu,\" No. 1 of contributions towards the \"Topography and History of Central Asia.\" Mr. Piton gives a biographical notice of two rival statesmen of Ts'in, \"Wei Yen and P'ing,\" from which we learn that the former was ennobled as Marquis of Yang in B.C. 291, and the latter as Marquis of Hsien in B.C. 286. If to these titled officials we add the Marquis Tang and Duke of Western Chow, other characters of history, it would appear that patents of nobility were then as freely given as at present. A short paper by Dr. Edkins on the \"Chinese Ch'ih Measure,\" notices of new books and queries, provocative of comment, make up a considerable number. The Rev. Hilderic Friend's original tale, \"The Willow Pattern,\" dealing with Chinese life, is also noticed; and the narrative of the French Tongking Expedition of 1884 is pronounced by the literary critic of the Society to evince great power of observation and description. (May and June, 1885), opens with another brief sketch by Mr. Piton, under the head of \"L\u00fc-Pu, from Merchant to Chancellor.\" This is followed by the continuation of Mr. Parker's \"Extracts\" commenced in the last issue. Two papers by Dr. Edkins and one by Dr. Friend, notices of new books, and notes and queries, are the chief contents. Among the books received are a reprint of Edkins' article, \"The Yi King of the Chinese,\" appeared in Vol. XVI. Part 3 of this Journal, and vol. xvi. of the Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal, in which the only article of Sinologic interest is said to be by Mr. E. H. Parker on the \"Ancient Language of China.\" The reviewer thinks that the Chinese themselves have shown any really philologic interest . . . but that the field of Chinese philology is as yet a barren waste,\" or brought under cultivation, in which labourers would pursue each his own course without depreciating that of another. Mrs. Bryson's \"Child Life in Chinese...\"\nmeets with approval, and the \"Cochin-Chine Fran\u00e7aise,\" in Nos. 17-21 of the Saigon \"Excursions et Reconnaissances,\" calls forth the remark that, whatever the political results of French conquests in Indo-China, they will convey immense advantages to the interests of science. Dr. Hirth's \"China and the Roman Orient\" is considered an instance of the expenditure of valuable time and energy on philological research, the results of which are not equivalent to the cost of the chandelle.\n\nTurkish.\u2014The \"Dictionnaire Turc-Fran\u00e7aise,\" by Barbier de Meynard, is a useful and admirable supplement to previous dictionaries, containing words of Turkish origin; Arabic and Persian words used in Osmanli Turkish with their particular significations; proverbs and popular sayings, and a geographical vocabulary of the Ottoman Empire. The fourth part of the 1st volume has been published by the Ecole des Langues Orientales Vivantes.\n\nThe Athen\u00e6um of May 8 heralds the forthcoming translation by Mr. E. J. W. Gibb of the \"History of the Forty Vazirs,\" a Turkish story-book of the 15th century. It adds that the only complete translation of this collection into a European language is that in German by Dr. Behrnauer (1851), containing 80 subordinate stories; but that, as MSS. differ in the selections made, Mr. Gibb proposes to publish no less than 112 distinct stories collected from separate versions, some of which will be found variants of widely-distributed popular tales.\n\nIn the preface of his little \"Vade Mecum of Ottoman Colloquial Language,\" published in 1885, Dr. J. W. Redhouse promised to prepare a series of more complete and scientific works for the use of those who might wish to penetrate deeper into the arcana of what he justly called the \"really beautiful\" Turkish language. This pledge, which was in part redeemed\nby the publication of a small but excellent English and Turkish-English Dictionary in 1856, and of complete English-Turkish Lexicon in 1861, is now its crowning fulfilment in the issue of an elaborate and extensive Turkish-English Lexicon. This book, three which are out, is being published by the Board of Missionaries at Constantinople\u00b9 (no English firm has found willing to take the risk), and will, when finished, be the most complete and trustworthy work of the kind European language. It contains 94,000 words, and four years in compilation. But this does not represent like the amount of time that has been spent in the materials utilized in compiling it. Some two ages ago the learned and industrious author commenced enormous Thesaurus of Arabic, Persian, Ottoman and Turkish words and phrases, explained at first both in Turkish and in English, latterly in English alone. A gigantic undertaking, in which it was intended to bring every procurable word in those languages, was brought to the end of the letter \u0646, when the long time that was necessary to complete the work, and the extreme impatience of finding any publisher willing to take it up, deterred the author to abandon his Herculean task. The tangible results of uninterrupted and loving labour the three volumes containing upwards of 84,000 words, many at great length, were last year (1885) presented by the author to the British Museum, where, the author hopes \"they may prove useful to young Oriental students in various ways, partly as an inducement to do better, and partly as a warning against attempting too much.\" It is the stores collected during the years of work at the mission that Dr. Redhouse has been enabled to complete his English Lexicon in the comparatively short space.\n\n\u00b9 Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner and Co. are the agents for its sale in this country.\nyears. Gifted with linguistic talents of a very high order, and having devoted a long life to the study of the Turkish language, and especially to Turkish lexicography, Dr. Redhouse is probably better equipped for the task undertaken than any other living scholar. Under these circumstances it was natural to expect that his work should be in every respect far superior to all existing European Turkish dictionaries. Judging from the three parts that have already appeared, these expectations will be more than realized; numerous words and phrases occurring in the classical writers of Turkey, which are absent from the pages of his predecessors, are to be found here; many meanings unknown to the earlier workers are entered; and in several instances erroneous or defective definitions are corrected or amplified. In preparing this invaluable work, Dr. Redhouse may well be said to have set the seal on his own reputation, and to have placed every student of the Ottoman language or literature under a lasting debt of gratitude.\n\n_Uzbek._\u2014In the _Athen\u00e6um_ of 21st November there is a review of \"Die Scheibaniade:\" an Uzbek Epic Poem in Seventy-six Cantos. The author of the original T\u00fbrki work was Prince Muhammad Salih of Khw\u00e2rizm; and Professor Vamb\u00e9ry has now reprinted the native text with a German translation, introduction, and notes.\n\n_Egyptology._\u2014On this subject there are in the _Academy:_\u2014June 6, 1885, a communication from Dr. W. Pleyte, of Leiden, reviewing the discoveries of M. Naville at Pithom. June 20, an article by M. Naville on the identification of Goshen. August 8 and 15 contain papers by M.

In September 26 she reviews, under the head \"Some Minor Egyptological Literature,\" the following books:\u2014\"Aegypten und Aegyptisches Leben in Altertum,\" by Dr. Adolf Erman; \"Egyptian Religion,\" by J. Lieblein; \"Gammelaegyptisk Religion,\" by J. Lieblein; \"Ueber Alt\u00e4gyptische Religion,\" by J. Lieblein; \"Ueber Pithom, Hero, Klysma nach Naville,\" by A. Dillmann; \"Ged\u00e4chtnissrede auf Karl Richard Lepsius,\" by A. Dillmann; \"Richard Lepsius: ein Lebensbild,\" by G. Ebers; \"Antichit\u00e0 Sarde e loro Provenienza,\" by G. Ebers. August 15 tells us that the Louvre has recently acquired about 31 demotic papyri, chiefly dating from the reigns of Psammetichus and Amasis. October 31 and November 7 contain an account of the third annual general meeting of the Egypt Exploration Fund, and of Mr. Petrie's paper on \"Naukratis,\" and M. Naville's on his excavations in the Delta and identification of Goshen.\n\nNovember 7 has, too, a letter from Dr. G. B\u00fchler on the recent discoveries made by Prof. Karabacek and Drs. Wessely and Krall in the course of their exploration of the Archduke Rainer's famous collection of papyri. In December 5 is a long notice of the Revue Egyptologique, 1881-85, by Miss Amelia B. Edwards, and in December 26 a review of E. A. Wallis Budge's \"The Dwellers on the Nile\" by Thomas Tyler. January 2 and 30, and February 6, have contributions from Mr. Flinders Petrie and Mr. Ernest Gardner, on the progress of discovery at Naukratis. January 2 has also a short communication from Mr. F. Ll. Griffith on the identification of Kom-el-Husn (a three hours' walk south of Naukratis) with Amu. We have most interesting \"Letters from Egypt\" by Professor Sayce, in the Nos. of January 23, February 13, March 20, and May 1. In that of March 20, dated from Luxor, February 26, he gives us some account of\nthe excavations at Assu\u00e1n by General Grenfell soldiers. There are also two short notices on this subject in Miss Amelia B. Edwards in March 13 and May 8. Feb. 13 notice is given of Mr. P. le Page Renouf's appointment as Keeper of Oriental Antiquities at the Museum, in succession to Dr. Birch, and also of the long looked for, and eagerly awaited, of M. Edouard's edition of the \"Book of the Dead.\" Under the \"American Jottings,\" Jan. 30 and May 8, we learn of the American branch of the Egypt Exploration Fund already over five hundred subscribers, and also that Mr. W. Thayer, formerly U.S. Consul at Trieste, dedicated to the Fund the entire net proceeds of the sale of his book \"Hebrews and the Red Sea.\" In Feb. 27 we have communications from Mr. Petrie and Mr. Griffith from Tell Nebesheh or Tanis, giving a description of the cemetery, and of a temple in which was found a black altar of Amenemhat II., (XII. Dynasty), beside which were the thrones of two life-sized statues of kings of that dynasty, a fragment of a statue important as confirming a geographic inference as to the hieroglyphic name of the nome. Two foundation deposits were discovered in the corn unimportant building in the cemetery. At the gate of the enclosure of the temple a headless sphinx in black granite with inscriptions much erased, but probably dating from the XII. Dynasty, was found; in the temple some scarabaeus blocks of red granite, two bearing figures of Khem; lower part, from waist to ankles, of a statue of Ptah in granite.\n\nSome of the identifications already made by the Egypt Exploration Fund are noted as follows: (Pithom)=Hero=Tell Maskhuta; Naukratis=Nebi; (Goshen)=Phakoussa=Saft-el-Henna; Amu, an Egyptian Libyan nome=Tell Hisn; nome of Am Pehu=Tani and Am=Tell Nebesheh or Tanis. The same Acade\nletter from Mr. Greville Chester on the genuineness of a set of chessmen from Thebes. The number for March 13 has a notice from Mr. Petrie on Tell Fer\u00e2in (Buto), and some further remarks from Mr. Griffith on Tell Nebesheh. March 27 has news of excavations at Naukratis from Mr. Ernest Gardner. April 10 gives us, from Mr. Petrie, an account of more discoveries at Tell Nebesheh, and of the finding, by Mr. Griffith, at Tell Gemayemi, of the traces of a large building and enclosure, with foundation deposits and several bronzes; the remains of a wooden shrine richly inlaid with inscriptions and patterns in coloured glass, unhappily broken up by the decay of the wood; a fine seated statuette of Isis; and a curious set of plaster casts of statues. In May 29 we have recorded the grateful thanks of the Trustees of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts for the large and valuable collection of pottery, metal work, and other objects excavated at Naukratis and San, and presented by the Egypt Exploration Fund in acknowledgment of the American contributions. In the Academy of March 6 is a review of Mr. Petrie's \"Tanis,\" part i., by Georg Ebers.\n\nAt the June meeting of the Society of Biblical Archaeology papers were read on \"The Topography of Northern Syria, with special reference to the Karnak Lists of Thothmes III.,\" by the Rev. H. G. Tomkins; \"The Eclipse in Egyptian Texts,\" by Mr. le Page Renouf; \"The Site of This,\" by Prof. Sayce. The \"Proceedings\" of the Society contain papers by: Mr. Cope Whitehouse on \"The Bahr Yusuf and the Prophecy of Jacob\"; Dr. A. Wiedemann on \"The Queen Pekersala, of the beginning of the Saitic Period,\" on \"The Egyptian Monuments at Venice,\" and \"Notes on the Cult of Set and on the Hyksos Kings\"; Mr. P. le Page Renouf on \"The Myth of Osiris Unnefer\" (see remarks and correspondence on this subject in the Academy of May 8 and 15); and Mr. E. A. Wallis Budge on \"Sepulchral Boxes.\" There are also communications from Prof. Sayce on \"A Hieroglyphical\nInscription at How,\" and from Mr. P. le Page D'Assier's \"The name of the Winged Solar Disk on Monuments.\"\n\nIn the Revue Egyptologique we have the following communications:\u2014\"On the Poem of Pentaur,\" by J. L. Burckhardt; Letters to M. Revillout on \"the Fayum Greek portraits in the Louvre,\" from Charles Wessely; on the Rights of Women, by Victor Revillout; on Housekeeping from a Greek papyrus in the British Museum; from M. Revillout, \"Adoption by Mancipation (purchase) in the time of Amasis, and divers forms of mancipation relating to animals and beings;\" \"The Prayers for the Dead in Egyptian Egyptian,\" \"Accounts of the Scrapbook,\" Greek papyrus in the British Museum, and a new extract on the cat, the jackal Koush and the Ethiopian cat; from W. M. Flinders Petrie, a Letter to M. Revillout on the names Jacob and Joseph in Egyptian.\n\nIn the Illustrated London News of July 18 there is an interesting paper by Miss Amelia B. Edwards on an account of the excavation of the Great Temple of Abydos carried out under the able direction of M. Maspero, with five illustrations from photographs.\n\nThe Archaeological Journal (No. 164) contains a paper on Antiquities from San, by Mr. Flinders Petrie.\n\nThe Athen\u00e6um of August 29 has a paper by Mr. Whitehouse on the Rician Basin of Lake Moeris. In August 15 a review of Brugsch's \"Religion und Mythologie der alten \u00c4gypter\"; in Dec. 26 is a notice of O. H. H. Gorringo's \"Egyptian Obelisks\"; and in the same mention is made of MM. Derenbourg's transcription of inscriptions, and explanations of sixty-one Phoenician inscriptions copied by Prof. Sayce from the graffiti in the tomb of Seti I. at Abydos.\n\nIn the Journal Asiatique (No. 2, 1835) M. Maspero gives an Arab version of the story of Rhampsinitas, which\nto relate, has returned to Egypt quite recently by means of the same writer's \"Contes populaires de l'Egypte ancienne,\" given by him to a schoolmaster at Erment. He, in his turn, passed the stories on to the people of Erment and Gournah, whence they travelled to Luxor and Neggadeh, and probably still further.\n\nObituary notices of the late Dr. Birch are to be found in all the well-known papers and magazines, and expressions of regret at his loss are received from Egyptologists in all parts of the globe. A collection of the several Biographies, together with a Bibliography of his literary works, has been published by his son, Mr. Walter De Gray Birch, F.S.A., etc.\n\nA most interesting series of Lectures on the Manners and Customs, Art and Literature, and Religion (with special reference to the burial of the dead), of the Ancient Egyptians, has been given to women in the Egyptian Galleries of the British Museum by Mrs. Tirard (Miss Helen Beloe).\n\nMr. Petrie geographically describes a \"Digger's Life\" in Egypt in the English Illustrated Magazine for March. Believers in Copts will have welcomed the testimony he gives, based on his own experience, to their worth. \"If ever Egypt is to stand alone,\" he says, \"it must be on a Coptic basis. That race\u2014the real Egyptians\u2014who have for twelve hundred years held their own against every persecution and in spite of a domineering fanaticism\u2014has in it more vitality than is dreamt of in England. If no foreign influence is brought to bear against them, and real liberty be established in the country, the Copts will, by their force of character and intellect, rise to the top. They have, in spite of everything, been all through at the top of the civil service, with nothing but the foreign military caste and its dependents above them, simply by brain power.\" We have thought it worth while to give this extract, coming as it does from one who for some years past has lived for\nthe most part not among the Europeans, but among the Egyptians in Egypt.\n\nWhile on the subject of Copts, we may mention Athen\u00e6um of August 15 has a review of Butler's Coptic Churches of Egypt\"; and that in the \"Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, May 4th, is an article by Mr. E. A. Wallis Budge, \"On a Coptic Versicle Encomium on Elijah the Tishtbite, attributed to Chrysostom.\"\n\nSome pamphlets on the subject of the Coptic Church have been published by the Association for the Furtherance of Christianity in Egypt. The endeavour of this Association is to hold out the hand of sympathy towards all who are to which, in due time, it may be able, without disturbing its nationality, to impart some more accurate knowledge of the truth, and some fresh vigour and spiritual life to this end classes for young men have been established in Cairo, with very fair success.\n\nAmong books recently published on Egypt, we may mention the following:\n\nE. Naville, \"Das \u00e4gyptische Todtenbuch der XX. Dynastic; H. de Vaujany, Description de la Basse-Egypte (deuxi\u00e8me partie), Alexsandrie et la Brugesch and J. D\u00fcmichen, Recueil de monuments \u00e9gyptiens (5i\u00e8me et 6i\u00e8me parties); A. Massy, \u00c9tudes \u00c9gyptiennes; I. Le Papyrus de Leyde; A. Massy, Glossaire des hi\u00e9roglyphes de Setna; A. Massy, Le Papyrus de Nebsoni (extrait du hi\u00e9roglyphique du livre des morts conserv\u00e9 au Louvre Museum); A.

Hyvernat,\nMartyrs de l\u2019Egypte, tir\u00e9s des manuscrits Coptes de la Biblioth\u00e8que Vaticane et du Mus\u00e9e Borgia.\n\nJapanese.\u2014To carry out the scheme for the Romanization of the Japanese language lately revived by the Professors of the University of Tokio, a society was formed which soon numbered a multitudo of members, including many names distinguished in science and in politics. A transliteration committee, consisting of four Japanese and two Europeans, was appointed, and the compilation of a vocabulary and test-periodical were taken into consideration. The Government will, it is believed, give the movement its support. Supporters of the innovation argue that the phonetic construction of the Japanese language is so far favourable to its introduction that it admits of the use of twenty-two Roman letters, without recourse being had to any diacritical marks, except the long sign over certain vowels.\n\nAmong new books relating to the country are: Isabella Bird, \u201cUnbeaten Tracks in Japan\u201d; Lord Ronald Gower, \u201cNotes of a Tour from Brindisi to Yokohama\u201d; Percy Thorpe, \u201cThe History of Japan\u201d; J. Morris, \u201cKotaka, a Japanese Tale\u201d; Judith Gautier, \u201cPo\u00e8mes de la Libellule, traduits du Japonais, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la version litt\u00e9rale de M. Saionzi, illustr\u00e9 par Yamamoto\u201d; Steindachner, F., and L. Doederlein, \u201cBeitrage zur Kenntniss der Fischer Japans, III.\u201d; B. H. Chamberlain, \u201cSimplified Grammar of the Japanese Language\u201d; P. Noack, \u201cLehrbuch der Japanischen Sprache.\u201d\n\nAnnales de l\u2019Extr\u00eame Orient.\u2014In the number for April we have the commencement of an interesting paper by P. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9, entitled \u201cLes Russes sur le Chemin de l\u2019Inde\u201d; a short notice of the Mahdi; M. J. Raubert\u2019s views on the French protectorate of Obock, with suggestions as to the occupation of Zulah (the ancient Adulis) and Shaikh Said, near Cape\nBab-el-Mandeb; and M. Lanchier's article (continuing \"Les Richesse Africaines et les moyens de les atteindre\") dealing mainly with Dahomey, Porto Novo, the Togo, and Lagos. In the number for May M. P. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9 discusses \"Les Russes sur le Chemin de l'Inde\"; M. Christi discusses the \"Commerce de Bangkok en Afrique,\" etc., applying them to Benin, the Niger, Bonny, and Old Calabar. There is also a short review of \"Richesses du Tongking, les produits \u00e0 y importer et l'administration Fran\u00e7aises.\" Guide administratif, commerciale, industriel, agricole,\" etc. The number for June has an interesting article by M. Mercier entitled \"Les voies commerciales de Gama,\" being a comprehensive survey of the chief coastal highways between the West and the extreme East prior to the doubling of the Cape of Good Hope by Vasco de Gama. The Wealth of Africa is illustrated this time by \"del Rey, le Rumby, la voie Ambas et le massif du Ca\u00efna, la rivi\u00e8re Bimbio et les habitans de William-town.\" There are also notes or communications on the coast of Guinea, Congo, Zanzibar, Madagascar, and Sumatra. In July there is the introduction to a paper on \"L'Art dramatique en Orient,\" by Count Meyners d'Estrey; the continuation of articles on the \"Richesses d'Afrique,\" in reference to the Cameroons; articles on Arab education in Tunis; the account of a voyage to the Somali country. The succeeding numbers are greatly taken up with the broached subjects of dramatic art in the far East, the riches of Africa, but there is in the September number a notice of Dr. Duka's \"Life of Csoma de K\u00f6r\u00f6s,\" M. L\u00e9on Feer pronounces \"un volume tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant de faits, de documents . . .\"; and a sketch of Australia, with a certain amount of useful statistical information. In December the subjects are the Portuguese in Morocco (continued); M. De Brazza's Mission, a short but\narticle on the French Congo; the Commerce of Tonking, and the Exterior Commerce of Independent Burma. The last attempts to show roughly the paying results of our annexation, and arrives at the conclusion that an intelligent and honest government could obtain from the country \"d'immenses richesses.\"\n\nEpigraphy.\u2014In its issue of 1st of August, 1885, the Academy states that a copy of the inscription which gives additional value to the cast of the Hittite Lion deposited in the Egyptian Gallery of the British Museum, would be found in the new edition of Dr. Wright's \"Empire of the Hittites.\"\n\nThe Revue Arch\u00e9ologique for Mai\u2014Juin contains an interesting article by Prof. G. Perrot, entitled \"The Monument of Eflat\u00fbn and a Hittite Inscription,\" in which an account and drawing are given of the curious monument of Eflat\u00fbn near Beg Shehr, in Asia Minor, first noticed by Hamilton, as well as of a new Hittite inscription discovered by Professor Sokslouski on a road leading from Ikonium. The copy of the inscription was found too imperfect to show more than its Hittite origin.\n\nUnder the title of \"L'Arabie avant Mahomet, d'apr\u00e8s les Inscriptions,\" M. Philippe Berger has published a valuable lecture on the important inscriptions recently discovered in Central Arabia, and the inferences that may be drawn from them. From a summary in the Academy of 15th August we learn that shortly after Mr. Doughty's journey to Meda\u00efn Saleh, and discovery there of Nabath\u00e6an tombs and inscriptions, Huber, the French traveller, found his way to the ruins of Teima, north-east of that place, and came upon \"an important st\u00e8le, containing two bas-reliefs in the Assyrian style, and an inscription of twenty-four lines in Aramaic characters, which are as early, at least, as the fourth century B.C.\" He had proposed to repeat the ex-\nploration in company with Prof. Euting, but was by the hand of the assassin. Fortunately, squ copies had been already taken of the inscription stone itself is now safe in the Louvre. In the engraved on it to the gods of Teima, attention to the Egyptian character of the second name i scription of the dedicator, \"the priest Tslem-Saz Petosiris.\" Like other inscriptions copied by Mes and Euting in the neighbourhood, this may be evidence of the former occupation of Central Nabath\u00e6an tribes. Since the Nabath\u00e6ans belong Aramaic branch of the Semitic race\u2014while i make it plain that Sab\u00e6an (or Himyaritic) infl culture extended northward as far as their southern little room is left, as M. Berger remarks, for \"t of the Koreishites and of Mohammed.\" He conc it must have originally been \"a dialect extremely in area, the language, in fact, of a small tribe, wh to local circumstances, reached, at a particular m extraordinary degree of perfection.\" The Academ that the names of the deities mentioned on the monuments will throw much light on Semitic n and quotes M. Clermont-Ganneau's indication th is a god to whom there is a reference in Amos v. various interpretations put upon the Scriptural pas what perplex the investigation, and although tl Version follows the Old in making Moloch and Ch names, Dr. Pusey holds the true reading to be, in t clauses, \"the tabernacle of your king (Ar. Chiun your images.\" In addition to an article on in the Revue d'Assyriologie et d'Arch\u00e9ologie Or E. Renan has addressed the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscri the 26th June and 3rd July, on the Aramaea Teima, which he considers second in interest to\n\n1 See note at page LXVI.\nof the Moabite King M\u00e9sa. The *Deutsche Literaturzeitung* of the 18th July has also a notice of these Nabathsean Inscriptions, and of Mr. Doughty's \"Documents Epigraphiques.\"\n\nIn the *Athenaeum* of the 26th September mention is made of Prof. Euting's account of ninety-eight inscriptions collected during his travels in Syria and Arabia in the years 1883\u20134, which appeared in the last number of the *Sitzungsberichte* of the Academy of Berlin, under the title of \"Epigraphische Miscellen.\" Amongst the collections are an old Hebrew and one old Aramaic inscription; two Phoenician, two Egyptian-Aramaic on papyrus, forty Palmyrene, twenty-two Hebrew and Graeco-Hebrew, and twenty-eight Greek inscriptions. Some have already been published by M. Clermont-Ganneau and by others. The Graeco-Hebrew inscriptions are of importance for the history of early Christianity. In the *Oesterreichische Monatschrift f\u00fcr den Orient* for August there is also a notice of Professor Euting's paper by Dr. G. H. M\u00fcller, of Vienna, who compliments him on the admirable way in which he has prepared these inscriptions for publication.\n\nBesides M. Renan's paper above named, the *Revue d'Assyriologie et d'Arch\u00e9ologie Orientale*, Tome i. No. 2, contains the following articles on epigraphy: J. and H. Derenbourg, \"Nouvelles \u00e9tudes sur l'\u00e9pigraphie du Yemen\"; J. Oppert, \"L'Inscription du Saros\"; Ledrain, \"Quelques inscriptions palmyr\u00e9niennes.\"\n\nAt the s\u00e9ance of the *Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions* of 29th May M. Oppert exhibited photographs of two fragments of trilingual inscriptions found at Rh\u00e9, the ancient Rhages, near Teheran. The inscriptions are of King Artaxerxes Mnemon. Their value is in the evidence they give that the Ach\u00e6menian kings sometimes resided in the region where the Median language was spoken, a circumstance to be inferred from the use made of that tongue in their inscriptions.\n\nAt the s\u00e9ance of the Acad\u00e9mie of the 24th July it was announced that important Coptic st\u00e8les had been found at\nErment and Assuan in Upper Egypt, the date could be determined by the inscriptions.\n\nThe Phoenician inscription referred to in the contents, vol. xxxix. part 2 of the Z.D.M.G. relate of an inscription on a marble fragment of an altar. The letters, about one hundred in number, are very formed. Dr. Schroeder fixes the date at about the fifth century.\n\nThe Academy of 6th June states that Prof. D. E has lately published and translated four new inscriptions at Palmyra, by Dr. Samson. One of them is attached figure of a man, above whom two palm branches are and two others are engraved, each between the busts and a woman. The last of these records the name of the son of Bob-agab, a name already met with in P texts, not unlike that of the Biblical Jacob.\n\nAccording to the Academy of the 29th August inscription of Nissanka Malla (12th century), discovered Anuradhapura in Ceylon, would be published in the of the Pali Text Society.\n\nIn No. iii. of the Revue d'Assyriologie et d'A Orientale for 1885 is a paper by the Dorembourg Phoenician Inscriptions of the Temple of Seti in Aby by Professor Oppert on a Babylonian Inscription ochus Setu; and one by M. Lethain on certain Inscriptions. The second is noteworthy from its ill of the light thrown by Cuneiform on other than loca\n\nAt the s\u00e9ance of the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions of September M. Bergaigne communicated a letter rece M. Aymonier reporting that he had obtained inscriptions, some of which were Sanskrit (one B He was to continue his studies on the Tcham race, preceded that of the Annamites on a part of the west Indo-China.\n\nIn the Revue Critique of 22nd June M. Clermont-\nhas a note on \"Une Nouvelle Inscription relative \u00e0 Baal Marcod,\" from the neighbourhood of Deir-el-Kal'a, near Beyrouth. In the number of 6th July he writes on \"Un nouveau titulus fun\u00e9raire de Jopp\u00e9,\" bearing a Greek inscription, recently discovered, and probably coming from the ancient Jewish burial-ground there, the position of which he determined some years ago.\n\nFrom the Athen\u00e6um of the 29th August we learn that Professor Derenbourg's first fasciculus of the Himyaritic Inscriptions\u2014forming part of the Corpus Inscriptionum Semitcarum, edited by the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres\u2014was then in the printer's hands; and, from the Academy of the 19th September, that the first chapter of the Aramaean Section (Fasc. iii.) was in slips, the second chapter, containing Aramaean Inscriptions, being ready for the press.\n\nM. S\u00e9nart's pamphlet, entitled \"L'Epigraphie et l'Histoire Linguistique de l'Inde,\" is an argument in favour of a more direct and serious employment of documents \u00e9pigraphiques to obtain further light on the history of Indian language and Indian literature. He gives his reasons for this new resort to Epigraphy, and formulates his conclusions under four heads; but the pamphlet should be studied as a whole, and is recommended for perusal accordingly. It consists of little more than twenty pages, and the writer's name is a sufficient guarantee that it is readable.\n\nNumismatics.\u2014Besides the three short papers by Mr. Charles J. Rodgers, Principal of the Normal College at Amritsir, which appears among the contents of part i., there is in part ii., Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, an article relating to symbols or devices on the gold coins of the Guptas, which will interest the numismatist. It is by Mr. W. Theobald, M.N.S.L., who aims at giving a new and more correct interpretation of Gupta symbols, such as the fillet, cornucopia, and footstool. Another article by Mr. Rodgers\non the square silver coins of the Sultans of Kashmir, historical as well as numismatic interest. There is also the same issue a paper by Major Raverty on the King Safavian Dynasty of Nimroz or Sigistan, referring previously published note by Mr. Rodgers on some Persian coins.\n\nThe Academy of June 6th, 1885, reviews Mr. Stan Poole's \"Coins and Medals; their place in History and Art;\" and the Athen\u00e6um of the 8th August the author's \"Coins of the Turks in the British Museum.\" The eight volumes which embrace the whole collection of respective coins are thus classified:\n\nVol. i. (1875), the initial coinage of the Muhamma for a period comprising nearly the whole numismatic history of the Khilafat till its overthrow by Hul\u00e1ku on the capture of Baghdad. Vol. ii. (1876), the Amawees of Spain and succeeding dynasties of that country; with the small states in North Africa, the Samanids of Samarkand, the Ghaznavids, Bokhara, the Ghaznavis, Khwarizmis, and Buwayhis. Vol. iii. (1877), the three great Turkman houses, Seljuk, Uzbak, and Bani Zangi, with those of smaller dynasties and independent rulers. Vol. iv. (1879), the coinage of Egypt of the Fatimites, Aiyubis, and Mamluk Sultans. Vol. v. (1880), the Moors of Africa and Spain, and Kings and Imams of Yemen. Vol. vi. (1881), the various Mughal dynasties. Vol. vii. (1882), Bukhara (Transoxiana) from Timurid times. Vol. viii. (and last, 1885), the Ottomanli or Turkish Empire to the present times, including the Amirs who rule over the Minor after the fall of the Seljukis of Rum.\n\nDr. Bushell's pamphlet on \"Ancient Roman Coins of Shansi\" is a republication from the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society. It gives an interesting account of the find of sixteen Roman copper coins, among which are included the money of twelve Emperors, ranging from Titus to Aurelian. A little copper coin of Henry III. of France.\nmade its way into the same collection. They are said to come from Ling-shih-hsien, a small district town in the interior of Shansi, on the left bank of the F\u00e9u, an affluent of the Yellow River, and about 20 miles north of Ho-chou. Dr. Bushell can venture no guess as to how they got to the locality, if indeed they were dug up there; their appearance led to the inference that they had been buried. He adds that \"the latest embassy from Ta-ch'in mentioned in the Chinese records arrived with 30,000 sheets of paper in A.D. 284, fourteen years after the death of Aurelian, the last Emperor represented\" in the series.\n\nFor information on Mr. Poole's \"Fasti Arabici,\" or recent works on Muhammadan and other Oriental coins, the space already taken up in the Annual Report suggests reference to the publications of the Numismatic Society.\n\nEnglish and Vernacular Literature of India.\u2014Calcutta Review.\u2014Civilians, soldiers and others whose better years have been passed in India, but who, after return home, have held little communication with residents in that vast Empire for a period of ten to twenty years, should experience a sensation of profound astonishment in perusing the numbers of the Calcutta Review as now issued. Not the least instructive portion of the contents of that well-maintained publication is that which affords insight into the progress of the native intellect. That natives of India should have learnt to write English as they do in the pages of the several Reviews, Proceedings of Societies, and periodicals which are received in England from the Presidencies and larger towns, is in itself surprising; but the fact may be in a great measure accounted for by the perseverance and almost thoroughness with which they engage in their earlier studies. Unlike the ordinary English student, who is called away from his books by cricket and boat-racing, tennis and other attractions or social demands, he spends his leisure\nhours in self-imposed scholastic tasks, and in man becomes imperceptibly a literary man, endowed literary style picked up from the writers of the da merits he has heard extolled by his English Prof companions.

It will be remembered that a short sketch of the distinguished writer\u2019s career is contained in the Obituary Notices of this Journal for May,\n1882, and that the first two parts, forming the first of his work, were published in 1880 and 1881. The entitled, \"An Essay on Indian History in the 16th C whereas the present volume is issued as a posthumous of papers arranged by Dr. Gunter v. Buchwald.

They are as follows:\n\nA large gold medal in value about 1000 Swedish crowns, and a sum of money amounting to 1250 Swedish crowns, to the author of the best\n\n1. History of the Semitic languages;\n2. Description of Arab Culture before the time of Muhammad.\n\nA Committee has been formed to carry out the details. Many conditions are attached, of which competitors should inform themselves before entering for competition. Papers should be sent in before the end of the year 1888.\n\nRussian Literature.\u2014Nine volumes in Russian, chiefly on the derivations and affinity of words in various tongues, by Platon Lukachevitch, have been presented to the Royal Asiatic Society by the author. Of these the titles of two may be mentioned, i.e.:\n\n1. An Explanation of Assyrian Names. Kiev, 1868.\n2. On the Origin of the Hebrew Language. Kiev, 1882.\n\nEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.\u2014Since the appearance of vol. xvii. of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (the last noticed in this Journal), three volumes have been issued. Among the principal articles in these, treating exclusively of Asiatic subjects, are the following:\n\nIn vol. xviii. Oxus, by General Walker, R.E.; Pahlavi, by Professor N\u00f6ldeke; Palestine, by Professor Socin; Palmyra, by Professor Robertson Smith; Parsis, by Dr. F\u00fchrer; Peking, by Professor Douglas; Persia, Ancient and Modern, by no less than five writers; Philippine Islands, by Mr. H. A. Webster; Phoenicia, by Professors Socin and Gutschmid; and Phrygia, by Mr. W. M. Ramsay. In vol. xx. General MacLagan's Punjab and Mr. Ronson's Rajputana should\nbe mentioned. Professor Robertson Smith lends his support to the theory that the Caphtu of Scripture is to be found with the Island of Crete.\n\n**British and Foreign Bible Society.**\u2014The Honorary Secretary has communicated, as usual, a statement of the progress made by the British and Foreign Bible Society in translating the Bible into the different languages of Asia, Africa, Oceania, and elsewhere. With the object for which these translations are made, the Society has no relation, but the annual outturn of new versions supplies a startling proof of the progress of Linguistic knowledge. The very names of some of the languages specified are totally unknown, and would have remained so, but for the translations; and it may be noted that the preparation of Grammars and Dictionaries must precede translation work, therefore, is of solid and abiding nature.\n\n**Amharic.**\u2014Mr. Flad completed the new edition of the Amharic Bible on May 15. As the work proceeded he found that more emendations were necessary than were at first contemplated. He received valuable assistance from Mr. Argawi, who visited Abyssinia in October, 1885. About a thousand local improvements were made in the Prophetical Books, and a great many in the New Testament.\n\n**Amoy-Colloquial.**\u2014On the return of Dr. Maxwell to England, the Rev. T. Barclay, M.A., of Formosa, was chosen to succeed him as Secretary to the New Testament Revision Committee. A good beginning has been made. Dr. Kip has revised the Epistles to the Thessalonians, and these have been printed at the mission press, and are now in the hands of the missionaries for final revision. Dr. Talmage has made steady progress with the Epistle to the Galatians, and Mr. Sadler has advanced with the Acts of the Apostles.\n\n**Api.**\u2014The Rev. Dr. Steel, of Sydney, reports that the Society's Auxiliary is printing a version of one Gospel language of the island of Api in the New Hebrides.\nArabic.\u2014Dr. Van Dyck has completed his re-examination of his version of the Bible, and all mistakes that have been discovered are being corrected, and all defective plates are being remade or amended. The New Testament is being brought out in two new sizes, and the books, which are handy and attractive, are expected to be very popular. A new set of stereotype plates, for Portions, are being prepared to supersede the Society's old plates. These new editions are being prepared at Beyrouth under the joint superintendence of the Rev. Dr. Isaac Bliss, of Constantinople, and the Rev. R. H. Weakley, of Alexandria, the Agents of the American, and the British and Foreign, Bible Societies.\n\nArarat-Armenian.\u2014The Society's Bible, published at Constantinople in 1883, has been undergoing a careful examination by the Rev. A. Amirkhaniantz during the last two years. A complete set of marginal references has been prepared, taken chiefly from Dr. Scrivener's Cambridge Bible. Certain words in the text are to be transposed, a few words omitted have to be supplied, some obsolete words have to be replaced by others in general use, and faults of punctuation have to be rectified. Mr. Amirkhaniantz will also prepare chapter headings condensed from those in the English Authorized Version.\n\nBeaver.\u2014At the request of the Rt. Rev. Dr. Richard Young, Bishop of Athabasca, the Committee have printed an edition of 500 copies of the Gospel of St. Mark in Roman character. The translation was made and edited by the Rev. A. C. Garrioch, of the Church Missionary Society. The version is the first book that has been printed in the language of the Beaver Indians, with the exception of a small and imperfect primer.\n\nCanton Colloquial (for the blind).\u2014The Committee, at the request of Mr. Samuel Dyer, the Society's Agent at Shanghai, have agreed to publish the Gospel of St. Luke in the Roman character. The version has been prepared by the Rev. F. Hartmann, of the Foundling Hospital, Hong Kong.\nChinese (Easy Wenli).\u2014At the request of the Committee of the Amoy Auxiliary Bible Society, the Committee have given permission to the Society's Agents in China to translate and circulate copies of the version of the New Testament made by the Rev. Griffith John in a style more simple than the Delegates' version. The version was brought out by the National Bible Society of Scotland.\n\nFanti (Ashanti).\u2014At the request of the Rev. J. Cannell, of the Cape Coast Wesleyan Mission, supported by the Rev. M. C. Osborn, the Committee have undertaken to publish an edition of 4000 copies of the Four Gospels. The translation was made by a Fanti minister, named Park, of the Wesleyan Church, whose father was a fetish priest. The translation was made from the English and completed in the Otji. It was afterwards carefully revised by a Committee of ministers, and finally passed by the Annual District Meeting of all the Wesleyan ministers. The version is now in use for the Wesleyan Mission, which occupies nearly the whole of the Gold Coast for a distance of 300 miles, and inland for about 150 miles. They have 267 chapels and preaching stations, 5988 members, and 23,660 attending on public occasions. The work is progressing slowly in the press, as the plates are being sent out to Cape Coast.\n\nFuh-chow Colloquial (Roman character).\u2014The Gospel of St. John, prepared for the press and edited by the Rev. Mr. Stewart, of the Church Missionary Society, has been received. A large portion of the New Testament is now ready for the press.\n\nGujarati.\u2014The Translation Sub-Committee held two meetings during the year, one at Surat and the other at Ahmedabad. The meetings lasted nineteen days, during which time the members engaged in revision work.\n\nHainan.\u2014The version of the Gospel of St. Matthew is now complete, and the Committee authorized Mr. Jeremiassen to make a translation for the aborigines of Hainan, who do not understand Chinese.\nbeen completed, and the Committee have authorized the publication of a tentative edition of 500 copies.\n\n**Hakka Colloquial.**\u2014At the request of the Rev. J. B. Ost, communicated by Mr. Samuel Dyer, the Society's Agent at Shanghai, the Committee have sanctioned the publication of the Old Testament, in portions, as the New Testament has already been published. The Book of Genesis is now passing through the press.\n\n**Har\u00e1ri.**\u2014A version of the Gospel of St. Matthew has been prepared, at the suggestion of Prof. Reinisch, of Vienna, by Hajlu, a Galla freedman from Harar. Hajlu was trained by the Swedish missionaries at Massowah, and he afterwards travelled with Prof. Reinisch in Africa as his servant. The Committee have agreed to purchase the version on the approval of Prof. Reinisch, to whom they already owe two new versions, the Bogos and the Falasha-Kara.\n\n**Hindi.**\u2014The New Testament Translation Committee, with the Rev. J. F. Holcomb as their secretary, have held six meetings since September, 1883, and have translated and revised the Gospels of St. Matthew, St. Mark, St. Luke, and part of St. John. The translators have followed the text that underlies the Revised English version.\n\n**Hindustani.**\u2014The Rev. M. G. Goldsmith, of the C.M.S., has carried through the press Genesis and Exodus up to chapter xx. He is now engaged in a revision of the Gospel of St. Luke. The Gospel of St. Mark has been submitted to the revisers, and Mr. Goldsmith awaits their judgment before proceeding further.\n\n**Igbiira.**\u2014The Ven. Archdeacon Johnson, C.M.S., the translator of the Nup\u00e9 Gospels, reports that the whole of the New Testament has been translated, and awaits revision.\n\n**Japanese.**\u2014The Rev. P. K. Fyson, of the Church Missionary Society, reports some progress with the translation of the Old Testament. The books of Leviticus, Numbers,\nDeuteronomy, and Daniel, have been translated, beginning the translation of Isaiah, but he fears they may not be ready for publication this year.\n\nJavanese.\u2014Mr. Jansz, having completed, by the native scholars at Surakata, his version of St. Matthew, now at Depok carrying the portion through the press, publication has been much delayed by the slowness of the printer.\n\nKabyle.\u2014The Gospel of St. John, translated by who assisted P\u00e8re Olivier in the preparation of his French dictionary, has been thoroughly revised by Sauerwein, who edited the portion. The little book is with considerable favour among the Kabyle.\n\nKafir (alias Xosa).\u2014The Revision Committee completed their labours on the Old Testament, and revising the New. The work is drawing to a close, and been heartily approved of by the representatives of all missionary bodies, including the Wesleyan. The Rev. has been appointed by the Revision Board to go to England to carry the version through the press.\n\nKalmuk (or Western Mongolian).\u2014This language related to the Burjat, in which we possess Swan and brass's translation of the whole Bible. During period of the first Russian Bible Society, as early translation of the Gospel of St. Matthew was printed Peteraburg by the British and Foreign Bible Society. John's Gospel was afterwards completed by the same Istor, Dr. Schmidt, of the Sarapta (Moravian). Subsequently the whole New Testament was said to completed, but it was never printed. The translation New Testament at present going forward, and of the Gospels are now in the press, has been taken up by Pozdnejeff, with the assistance of the Archimandrite in Astrakhan. The original number of the edition comprise 2000 copies, but at Professor Pozdnejeff\nthe number was enlarged to 4000, with a subsidiary edition of 1000 copies of each of the four Gospels. This was founded on statistics supplied by the Prussian, according to which the number of Kalmyks in European Russia should be, as estimated in 1889, 119,560; in Asiatic Russia, 40,000; while in China there are said to be 253,440 souls, possessed of a common language, not indeed devoid of dialectal peculiarities, but mutually intelligible, and having a common literature.\n\nKazan-Turki.\u2014In 1884 an edition of 5000 copies of M. Saleman's version of St. Matthew was printed at the Kazan University Press. Saleman's translation of St. Mark, though completed, has not yet been printed. Mr. Nicolson writes: \"The people for whom this translation is being made are the remains of the mighty Tartar kingdom which once had its seat at Kazan, on the Volga. They inhabit the Governments of Kazan, Orenburg, Samara, and Stavropol, and are said to number about 1,000,000 souls.\"\n\nKirghiz-Turki.\u2014A third edition of the New Testament, consisting of 4000 copies, is now being printed at the Kazan University Press, and edited by M. Saleman, of the St. Petersburg University. The first edition, consisting of 5000 copies, was printed at Astrakhan in 1820. The version was an adaptation, by the Rev. Charles Fraser, of the Scottish Mission, of the version made by the Rev. H. Brunton, and printed at Karass. The version was revised by Professor Gottwald, and an edition of 3000 copies was printed at the Kazan University Press for this Society, under the care of M. Saleman in 1880.\n\nThe Rev. W. Nicolson, the Society's Agent at St. Petersburg, says of the people for whom the version is intended: \"The Kirghese hordes\u2014Great, Little, and Middle, as they are called\u2014occupy various regions in Southern Siberia, Central Asia, and west of the Caspian Sea. The numbers of these hordes are variously estimated as high as 2,000,000, and as\nlow as 1,450,000, the lower number being probably correct.\"\n\nKumuk-Turki.\u2014The version of St. Matthew, in Khasan Beg, has been revised by Major Tchekano linguist, acquainted with Kumuk, and again re-re Mr. Amirkhaniantz, who compared it diligently with the The work being found satisfactory, the Committee has taken to print an edition of 500 copies. The proofs read by Dr. Sauerwein.\n\nThe only other known book in the language is volume of popular tales and songs, edited by Mahmoud a mollah of the village Khasav-Turt.\n\nThe Kumuk is spoken by about 70,000 souls, in the north-west shore of the Caspian Sea, near Petr the north-east districts of Daghestan, watered by t and Sunja Rivers. It is also found on the Terek above Kizliar. Mr. Morrison, the Society's Agent Russia, to whom we owe this version, and our in regarding the people, says: \"The Kumuk are a people, learning to till the soil, and availing than the schools which the Russian Government has placed them.\"\n\nLifu (Oceania).\u2014The Rev. S. M. Creagh continues the MS. and the marginal references of the Revised of the Bible, which will be ready for the press as soon edition is called for.\n\nMalagasi.\u2014The Rev. W. E. Cousins reports the co on October 28, 1885, of the first revision of the Bil December 1, 1873.

Messrs. Matthissen and Walter, of the Basel Mission, and it has been resolved to invite the Right Rev. Mar Athanasius, of the Syrian Church, to co-operate in the revision.\n\nA special united meeting of the Delegates was held at Cochin last September, and it was resolved to revise again the Revised New Testament.
