I.\u2014The Story of Devasmit\u0101. Translated from the Kath\u0101 Sarit S\u0101gara, Tar\u0101nga 13, Sloka 54, by the Rev. B. Hale Wortham, M.R.A.S.\n\nUpon this earth a famous city stands\nCalled Tamralipt\u0101; once a merchant dwelt\nWithin that town, possessed of endless wealth,\nNamed Dhanadatt\u0101. Now he had no son.\nTherefore with all due reverence he called\nThe priests together; and he spoke and said:\u2014\n\"I have no son: perform, most holy Sirs!\nSuch rites as may procure for me a son,\nWithout delay.\" The Br\u0101hmans answering\nSaid: \"This indeed is easy: there is naught\nImpossible to Br\u0101hmans by the means\nOf sacred rites ordained by Holy Writ.\nThis be a proof to you. In times gone by\nThere lived a king, and though his wives surpassed\nBy five a hundred, yet he had no son.\nAt last a son\u2014the fruit of sacrifice\u2014\nWas born to him: to whom they gave the name\nOf Santu: and the prince's wives were filled\nWith joy as if the newly risen moon\nFirst broke upon their eyes. It happened once\nThe child was crawling on the ground,\u2014an ant\nBit him upon the thigh; and at the smart\nHe sobbed and cried. Immediately there rose\nThe sound of woe, and lamentation filled\nThe royal palace, while the king himself\nForgot his royal state, and cried aloud,\n\u2018My son! my son!\u2019 Ere long the child\u2019s lament\nWas pacified\u2014the ant removed. The king,\nReflecting thus upon the cause which led\nTo all his sorrow, thought; \u2018My heart is filled\nWith pain because I have, alas! but one,\nOne only son. Is there,\u2019 he asked, in grief,\n\u2018Most holy Br\u0101hmans,\u2014is there any means\nBy which innumerable sons may be\nMy lot?\u2019 They answered him, \u2018There is, O king,\nBut one expedient. Slay this thy son,\nAnd offer up his flesh a sacrifice.\nThy wives shall smell the savour of his flesh\nBurnt by the fire: so shall they bear thee sons.\u2019\nThe King, obedient to the Br\u0101hmans\u2019 word,\nStrengthened with all due pomp and ritual,\nOffered the sacrifice: and thus ere long\nEach wife bore him a son. So too will we\nBy sacrifice and offering procure\nA son for you.\u201d When Dhanadatt\u0101 heard\nThe Br\u0101hmans, then the sacrificial fee\nHe gave, and they performed the sacrifice;\nSo through that sacrifice the merchant gained\nA son, named Guhasena. Time went on,\nThe boy grew up and Dhanadatt\u0101 sought\nA wife for him. So then the father went\nTo some far distant country with his son,\nOn the pretence of traffic: but in truth\nTo get his son a bride. And there he begged\nOne Dharmagupta\u2014held in high repute\nAmong his fellow citizens\u2014to give\nHis daughter Devasmit\u0101 as a bride\nTo Guhasena. But the father loved\nHis child, nor cared that she should be allied\nWith one whose home was in a distant land.\nBut Devasmit\u0101 saw the merchant\u2019s son,\nAnd at the sight of him, so richly graced\nWith virtues, lo! her heart fled from her grasp,\nNor thought she more of sire or home, but sent\nA trusty friend to tell him of her love.\nAnd then, leaving her native land, she fled\nBy night with her beloved. So they came\nTo Tamralipt\u00e2: and the youthful pair\nWere joined in wedlock, while their hearts were knit\nTogether in the bonds of mutual love.\n\nThen Guhasena's father passed away\nFrom earth to heaven: and kinsmen urged on him\nA journey to Ku\u1e6d\u0101ha, for the sake\nOf merchandize. But Devasmit\u00e2, filled\nWith doubt,\u2014fearing her husband's constancy\nMight fail, attracted by another's charms,\nRefused to listen to him when he spoke\nOf his departure. Guhasena's mind\nWas filled with doubt, on one side urged by friends\nTo go, while on the other side his wife\nWas hostile to his journey. Thus what course\nHe should pursue\u2014his heart intent on right\u2014\nHe knew not. Therefore to the god he went\nWith rigid fast, and now, hoping to find\nHis way made plain before him, through the aid\nOf the Divinity; and with him went\nHis wife. Then in a dream the god appeared\nWith two red lotuses: and \u015aiv\u00e2 said\u2014\nPlacing a lotus in the hand of each:\u2014\n\"Take each of you this lotus in your hand;\nIf in your separation one shall be\nUnfaithful, then the lotus flower shall fade\nThe other holds.\" The pair awaking saw\nThe lotus blossom in each other's hand.\nAnd as they gazed it seemed as though each held\nThe other's heart. Then Guhasena went\nForth on his journey, bearing in his hand\nThe crimson lotus: while, with eyes fast fixed\nUpon her flower, Devasmit\u00e2 stayed\nAt home. No long time passed\u2014in Ka\u1e6dah\u00e2\nArrived her husband,\u2014making merchandize\nOf jewels. Now it happened that there dwelt\nFour merchants in that country: when they saw\nThe unfading lotus ever in his hand,\nWonder possessed them. So by stratagem\nThey brought him home, and put before him wine\nIn measure plentiful. And he, deprived\nOf mastery o'er his sense, through drunkenness,\nTold them the whole. Then those four merchants planned,\nLike rascals as they were, to lead astray\nThe merchant's wife through curiosity.\nFor well they knew that Guhasena's trade\nWould keep him long in Ka\u1e6dah\u0101 engaged\nOn merchandize. Therefore they left in haste\nAnd secrecy\u2014to carry out their plan,\nAnd entered Tamralipt\u0101. There they sought\nSome one to help them, and at last they found\nA female devotee, dwelling within\nThe sanctuary of Buddha: \"Honoured dame!\"\nThey said, addressing her with reverence,\n\"Wealth shall be thine in plenty, if in this\nOur object, thou wilt grant to us thy help.\"\n\"Doubtless,\" she said, \"some woman in this town\nIs your desire: tell me and you shall gain\nYour wish. I want no money: for enough\nI have, through Siddhikari's care,\u2014\nMy pupil of distinguished cleverness,\nBy whose beneficence I have obtained\nRiches untold.\" \"We pray thee, tell us now,\"\nExclaimed the merchants, \"how these riches came\nTo thee through Siddhikari.\" \"Listen then!\"\nReplied the devotee. \"If you, my sons,\nDesire to hear it, I will tell the tale:\u2014\nSome time ago a certain merchant came\nHere from the north, and while within this town\nHe dwelt, my pupil, meaning treachery,\nBegged, in disguise, the post of serving maid\nIn his abode: and after having gained\nThe merchant's confidence, she stole away\nAt early dawn, and carried off with her\nThe merchant's hoard of gold. And as she went\nOut from the city, flying rapidly\nThrough fear, a certain Domba followed her\nBearing his drum, on plunder bent. At length\nIn headlong flight, a Nyagrodha tree\nShe reached, and seeing that her foe was close\nBehind her, putting on a look of woe\nThe crafty Siddhikari said, 'Alas!\nA grievous strife of jealousy has come\nBetween my spouse and me, therefore my home\nHave I forsaken, and I fain would end\nMy life; therefore I pray thee make a noose\nThat I may hang myself.' The Domba thought,\n'Nay! why should I be guilty of her death?\nNought is she but a woman! let her hang\nHerself.' And therefore tying up the knot,\nHe fixed it firmly for her to the tree.\nThen said she, feigning ignorance, 'This noose\u2014\nWhere do you place it? I entreat of you\nTo show me.' Then the Domba put the drum\nUpon the ground, and mounting on it, tied\nRound his own neck the noose; 'This is the way,\nHe said, we do the job!' Then, with a kick,\nThe crafty Siddhikari smashed the drum\nTo atoms: and the thievish Domba hung\nTill he was dead. Just then in view there came\nThe merchant, seeking for his stolen gold.\nStanding beneath the tree, not far ahead,\nHe saw his servant maid. She saw him too\u2014\nInto the tree she climbed, unseen by him,\nAnd hid among the leaves. The merchant soon\nArrived, attended by his serving men.\nHe found the Domba hanging by a rope,\nBut as for Siddhikari, nought of her\nCould he perceive. One of his servants said:\n'What think you? Has she climbed into this tree?'\nAnd straightway clambered up. Then seeing him,\n'Ah! sir,' said Siddhikari, 'now indeed\nI am rejoiced: for you have ever been\nMy choice. Take all this wealth, my charming friend,\nAnd come! embrace me!\u2019 So the fool was caught\nBy Siddhikari\u2019s flattery; and she,\nKissing him on the lips, bit off his tongue.\nThen uttering spluttering sounds of pain, the man\nFell from the tree, spitting from out his mouth\nThe blood. The merchant seeing this, in fear and haste,\nRan homewards, thinking that his serving man\nHad been the victim of some demon foul.\nThen Siddhikari, too, not less alarmed,\nDescended from the tree, and got clear off\nWith all the plunder. In this way, my sons,\nThrough her ability I have obtained\nThe wealth, which through her kindness I enjoy.\u201d\nJust as she finished, Siddhikari came\nInto the house: and to the merchant\u2019s sons\nThe devotee presented her. \u201cMy sons!\u201d\nSaid the ascetic, \u201ctell me openly\nYour business: say what woman do you seek\u2014\nShe shall be yours.\u201d They said, \u201cProcure for us\nAn interview with Devasmit\u0101, wife\nTo Guhasena.\u201d Said the devotee,\n\u201cIt shall be done for you,\u201d and gave these men\nA lodging in her house. Then she assailed\nWith bribes and sweetmeats all the slaves who dwelt\nIn Guhasena\u2019s house: and afterwards\nWent there with Siddhikari. When she came\nTo Devasmit\u0101\u2019s dwelling and would go\nWithin, a bitch chained up before the door\nKept her from entering. Devasmit\u0101 then\nSent out a maid to bring the stranger in,\nThinking within herself, \u201cWho can this be?\u201d\nThe vile ascetic, entering the house\nTreated the merchant\u2019s wife with feigned respect,\nAnd blessed her, saying: \u201cLong have I desired\nExceedingly to see you: in a dream\nTo-day you passed before me: therefore now\nI come with eagerness: affliction fills\nMy mind when I behold you from your spouse\nThus torn asunder. What avails your youth,\nOr what your beauty, since you live deprived\nOf your beloved?\" Thus, with flattering words,\nThe ascetic tried to gain the confidence\nOf virtuous Devasmit\u00e2. No long time\nShe stayed, but soon, bidding farewell, returned\nTo her own house. Ere long she came again,\nThis time bringing a piece of meat well strewed\nWith pepper dust: before the door she threw\nThe peppered meat; the bitch with greediness\nGobbled the morsel up, pepper and all.\nThe bitch's eyes began to flow with tears\nProfusely, through the pepper, and her nose\nTo run. Then went the crafty devotee\nWithin, to Devasmit\u00e2: and she wept,\nAlthough received with hospitality.\nThen said the merchant's wife: \"Why do you weep?\"\nFeigning reluctance, the ascetic said:\n\"My friend! you see this bitch weeping outside;\u2014\nKnow then! this creature in a former state\nWas my companion: seeing me again\nShe knew me, and she wept: my tears gush forth\nIn sympathy.\" When Devasmit\u00e2 saw\nThe bitch outside seeming to weep, she thought,\n\"What may this wonder be?\" \"The bitch and I\"\u2014\nContinuing her tale, the ascetic said\u2014\n\"Were in a former birth a Brahman's wives.\nOur husband often was from home, engaged\nOn embassies by order of the king.\nMeanwhile I spent my time with other men,\nLiving a life of pleasure, nor did I\nDefraud my senses of enjoyment due\nTo them. For this is said to be, my child,\nThe highest duty\u2014to indulge one's sense,\nAnd give the rein to pleasure. Therefore I\nHave come to earth again, as you behold\nMe now, remembering my former self.\nBut she thought not of this, setting her mind\nTo keep her fame unsullied: therefore born\nInto this world again, she holds a place\nContemptible and mean: her former birth\nStill in her memory.\u201d The merchant\u2019s wife\u2014\nPrudent and thoughtful, said within herself\u2014\n\u201cThis doctrine is both new and strange: no doubt\nThe woman has some treacherous snare for me.\u201d\n\u201cMost reverend Dame!\u201d she said, \u201ctoo much, alas!\nI fear, have I neglected hitherto\nThis duty. So, I pray you, gain for me\nAn interview with some delightful man.\u201d\nThe ascetic answered, \u201cThere are living here\nSome merchants, young and charming, who have come\nFrom far; them will I bring you.\u201d Filled with joy\nShe homeward turned: while Devasmit\u0101 said\u2014\nHer natural prudence coming to her aid:\n\u201cThese scoundrelly young merchants, whosoe\u2019er\nThey be, I know not, must have seen the flow\u2019r\nUnfading, carried in my husband\u2019s hand.\nIt may be that they asked him, over wine,\nAnd learnt its history. Now they intend\nTo lead me from my duty: and for this\nThey use the vile ascetic. Therefore bring\u201d\n(She bid her maids) \u201cas quickly as you may,\nSome wine mixed with Datura: and procure\nAn iron brand, bearing the sign impressed\nOf a dog\u2019s foot upon it.\u201d These commands\nThe servants carried out: one of the maids,\nBy Devasmit\u0101\u2019s orders, dressed herself\nTo personate her mistress. Then the men\nAll eagerness, each wished to be the first\nTo visit Devasmit\u0101: but the dame\nChose one of them: in Siddhikari\u2019s dress\nDisguising him, she left him at the house.\nThe maid, clothed in her mistress\u2019s attire,\nAddressed the merchant\u2019s son with courtesy,\nPolitely offering him the wine to drink\nDrugged with Datura. Then the liquor stole\nHis senses from him, like his shamelessness,\nDepriving him of reason; and the maid\nStripped him of all his clothes, and ornaments,\nLeaving him naked. When the night had come,\nThey cast him out into a filthy ditch,\nMarking his forehead with the iron brand.\nThe night passed by, and consciousness returned\nIn the last watch to him, and waking up\nHe thought himself in hell, the place assigned\nTo him for his offences. Then he rose\nFrom out the ditch, and went in nakedness\nHome to the devotee, the mark impressed\nUpon his forehead. Fearing ridicule\nHe said, that he had been beset by thieves\nUpon the way, and all day long at home\nHe sat, a cloth bound round his head to hide\nThe brand, saying that sleeplessness and wine\nHad made his head ache. In the self-same way\nThey served the second merchant. He returned\nHome naked; and he said, \"While on the road\nFrom Devasmit\u0101's house, I was attacked\nBy robbers, and they stripped me of my clothes,\nAnd ornaments.\" He sat with bandaged head\nTo hide the brand, and made the same excuse.\nThus all the four suffered the same disgrace,\nAnd all concealed their shame; nor did they tell\nTheir ills to the ascetic when they left\nHer dwelling: for they trusted that a plight\nLike theirs would be her lot. Next day she went\nFollowed by her disciple, to the house\nOf Devasmit\u0101; and her mind was filled\nFull of delight, because she had achieved\nHer end so happily. With reverence\nThe merchant's wife received the devotee,\nAnd feigning gratitude, with courteous speech\nOffered her wine mixed with the harmful drug.\nThe ascetic drank; and her disciple both\nWere overcome. Then helpless as they were\nBy Devasmita's orders they were cast\nWith ears and noses slit, into a pool\nOf filthy mud. Then Devasmita thought,\n\"Perchance these merchants may revenge themselves\nAnd slay my husband.\" So she told the tale\nTo Guhasena's mother. \"Well, my child,\"\nAnswered her husband's mother, \"have you done\nYour duty! Still misfortune may befall\nMy son through this.\" \"I will deliver him,\"\nSaid Devasmita, \"as in times gone by\nBy wisdom Saktimati saved her spouse.\"\n\"My daughter, how was this? tell me, I pray.\"\nThen answered Devasmita, \"In our land\nWithin this city stands an ancient fane,\nThe dwelling of a Yaksha: and his name\nIs Munibhadra. There the people come\nAnd offer up their prayers, and make their gifts,\nTo gain from heaven the blessings they desire.\nIf it so happen, that a man is caught\nAt night with some one else's wife, the pair\nAre placed within the temple's inmost shrine.\nNext morning they are brought before the king,\nSentence is passed on them, and punishment\nDecreed. Now in that town the city guards\nOnce found a merchant with another's wife;\nAnd therefore by the law, the two were seized\nAnd placed within the temple: while the door\nWas firmly shut and barred. The merchant's wife,\nWhose name was Saktimati, came to learn\nHer husband's trouble; and she boldly went\nBy night with her companions to the shrine,\nBearing her offerings for the God. The priest,\nWhose duty was to eat the offering,\nBeheld her come: desirous of the fee,\nHe let her in, telling the magistrate\nWhat he had done. Then Saktimati saw\nHer husband looking like a fool, within\nThe inner room, in company with him\nThe woman. So she took her own disguise\nAnd putting it upon the woman, bade\nHer flee with haste. But \u015aaktimati stayed\nWithin the shrine. Day broke; the officers\nCame to investigate the merchant's crime,\nAnd lo! within the temple's inner room\nThey found the merchant and\u2014his wife. The king,\nHearing the tale, punished the city guard\nBut set the merchant free. So he escaped,\nAs if held in the very jaws of death,\nOut of the Yaksha's temple. So will I,\nAs \u015aaktimati did, in bygone times,\nBy wisdom and discretion save my spouse.\"\nThus Devasmit\u0101 spoke: and putting on\nA merchant's dress, she started with her maids\nUnder pretence of merchandise to join\nHer husband at Ka\u1e6d\u0101ha. When she came\nTo that fair country, she beheld him sit,\nLike comfort come to earth in human form,\nAmid the merchants. He beholding her\nAfar, clothed in a merchant's dress, then thought;\u2014\n\"Who can this merchant be, so like my wife\nIn form and feature?\" Earnestly he gazed\nUpon her face. Then Devasmit\u0101 went\nAnd begged the king to send throughout his realm\nAnd summon all his subjects; for she had\nA boon she fain would ask of him. The king\nConvoking, full of curiosity,\nHis citizens, addressed that lady clothed\nIn man's attire, and said, \"What do you ask?\"\nThen answered Devasmit\u0101, \"In your town\nFour slaves of mine are living, who have run\nAway. I pray you, noble king, restore\nMy slaves.\" \"The citizens,\" replied the king,\n\"Are all before you, therefore recognize\nAnd take your slaves.\" Then Devasmit\u0101 seized\nThe four young merchants, whom she had disgraced\nAnd treated so disdainfully: their heads\nStill bound about with wrappers. Then enraged,\nThe merchants of the city said, \"Why these\nAre sons of honourable men: then how\nCan they be slaves to you?\" She answered them:\n\"If you believe me not, here is the proof:\u2014\nTake from their heads the bandage; you will see\nA dog's foot on their forehead: with this brand\nI marked them.\" Then the wrappers were removed\nAnd on their foreheads all beheld the mark\u2014\nThe dog's foot brand.\" Then were the merchants filled\nWith shame: the king himself in wonder said:\n\"Pray what means this?\" Then Devasmit\u0101 told\nThe story. Laughter filled the crowd: the king\nTurned to the merchant's wife: \"There are your slaves,\"\nHe said; \"your claim indeed none may dispute.\"\nThen all the merchants in the city gave\nVast sums of money to the prudent wife\nOf Guhasena, to redeem the four\nYoung men from slavery: and to the king\nThey paid a fine. Thus Devasmit\u0101 gained\nMoney, and honour too, from all good men.\nThen to her native city she returned,\nEven to T\u0101mralipt\u0101, never more\nTo be disjoined from her beloved lord.\nART. II.\u2014Pujahs in the Sutlej Valley, Himalayas. By William Simpson, F.R.G.S., Hon. Associate R.I.B.A.\n\nIn the summer of 1860, I started from Simla to pass a few weeks at Chini, so as to avoid the rains. Chini is 16 marches about due east, which may be roughly put as being nearly 200 miles. Being just beyond the higher range of the Himalayan chain, the rain cloud is generally spent before it reaches the locality; still there is enough moisture to nourish vegetation, so that trees and flowers are plentiful. About two or three marches beyond this the rainless region commences, where trees are few and far between, and crops depend on the irrigation of small streams coming down from the melted snow of the higher peaks. Chini is about 10,000 feet above the sea, hence it is a most delightful climate in the summer; and few places in the Himalayas can present such a splendid view as the one looking across the Sutlej from the village. A bungalow had been erected at the time of Lord Dalhousie, and in it I put up for about two months; as I did my best when any of the people applied with ailments, they became friendly, and seeing me sketching, and taking an interest in their doings, they announced their ceremonies, and invited me to come and see them. I regret that my knowledge of the ordinary Hindostani was, at that time, but very small, so that I was unable to ask questions and collect information; from this cause my account of their Pujahs is far from complete. Were it not, that, so far as I am aware, no account of these curious ceremonies has appeared,\u2014except a poplar sketch I gave in Good Words,\u00b9\u2014the present notice would not have been attempted. Gerard, who travelled for about four months in the Sutlej Valley and neighbourhood, in 1821, does not seem to have witnessed them, or he would have been certain to have given a description. Travellers passing through\n\n\u00b9 Sept. 1866.\nhave but small chance of seeing such doings; it was the lengthened stay I made which gave me the opportunity.\n\nHimalayan villages are generally very small, but in nearly every one will be found a temple. These temples are unlike those on the plains of India; they attract the eye from their being larger and more important than the other houses, and generally there is more carving and ornament about them than on the ordinary dwellings of the people. Their purpose is simply that of being a house for the local representation of their divinity. \"Devi-ke-makan\" is the name usually given to them, but \"Thakoor-dwara\" is a term not unknown in the hills. At nearly all the temples there is a shed in front, formed of four wooden pillars with a roof of the same material, and ornamented in the style of the temple. It is called a \"Dharmasalah,\" as it is the only place of shelter in the village for travellers: but it has a purpose connected with the ceremonies, the god when brought out of the temple is at intervals placed in it; round it is a circular space, rudely paved, bearing a strong resemblance to the thrashing floors of the villages, on which dancing and other rites are performed.\n\nThe peculiar object of worship in these temples is a structure which can be carried by two men with staves on their shoulders. So far as I was able to see the one at Chini, it was formed of a square frame-work\u2014an office-stool with the seat removed will convey a rough notion of this part of it,\u2014this frame was completely concealed by pieces of silk of various colours which hung down all round, and a piece of red cloth hung over the staves on each side, covering them, except where they touched the men's shoulder. Above the level of the staves were some faces round the central part, they were formed of masks, either of gold or brass. I understood that they represented Devi; the central part was surmounted by a mass of Yak's tails dyed red; it may be presumed that they were looked upon as chowries, which are royal emblems, and were placed there as a mark of honour.\n\nThis gives only the outward appearance of this god. What constituted its sanctity I never could find out. It would\nhave been looked upon as an act of sacrilege if I had touched the object, and the want of language stood in my way, so that proper inquiries could not be made. My supposition is that there was something enclosed in the central part, which endowed it with the character of a deity. I should feel grateful if any one travelling in the hills about Simla could investigate this subject, and would kindly let me know the result. I have always regretted not having acquired the necessary knowledge on this point, as it may be of importance in relation to the ceremonies.\n\nThe name used in relation to this peculiar object was \"Khuda,\" but perhaps \"Devi\" was more generally given. This word would imply that they were all feminine, a point I do not feel quite certain upon. Mahadeo has temples in the north-western part of the Himalayas; and Lloyd states that there are temples at Rampur \"to Seeta Ram, Nur Sing, and Shalgram\" \u2014 these imply the worship of Vishnu; but the worship of Kali seems to be the most common in the region. It might have been expected that Parvati, the mountain-born bride of Siva, would have been the favourite in the hills, but the sacrifice of animals, and the offering of blood, which will be described, show that the more terrible forms of Kali receive adoration. Gerard, writing in 1821, says, that only six or seven years before that time human sacrifices were offered to Bhima-Kali in a temple at Serahn; this particular goddess being called the \"Governess of Busahir,\" will show her importance in this section of the Sutlej Valley.\n\nI was fortunate enough to see and make sketches of similar Devis on the Ganges and the Jumna, which differed somewhat from those of the Sutlej. One of these was at the village of Karsali, near Jumnotri; in it the central part rose about eight or nine inches above the staves, and terminated in a flat pyramidal form, this was covered with red cloth, and bandaged round with other colours. It had no masks or chowries. Another was at a place called Balah, on the Ganges. Here the central part stood up, and was cubical.\n\n1 Lloyd and Gerard's Narrative, vol. i. p. 183. 2 Ibid. vol. ii. p. 302.\nin form, also covered with orange-coloured cloth, and garlanded with flowers. This was surmounted by a silver vase, above which was a miniature umbrella of the same material. A white pall, richly decorated with elephants, bulls, and other forms of ornament, in red and buff, extended along the staves and hung down almost to the ground. Over this was a smaller piece of drapery of bright orange, and a couple of chowries, one white and the other black, hung down from the central part. Some of the men with the Devi carried banners, the staff of which was of iron, and each was surmounted by a trisula; this may perhaps be seen in other parts of India, but I have never chanced to meet with it. I only know from the old Buddhist sculptures that it was common about 2000 years ago. I am inclined to class the trisula with a number of old forms, which have come down almost unchanged from the past, and the Devis themselves will in all probability turn out to be objects which have existed from a remote antiquity. Indeed I may state that I was much struck with the number of things which seemed to be primitive, and unaffected by the usual influences of time, in this part of the world. As an evidence on this head it may be mentioned that the houses of the Sutlej Valley bear a strong resemblance, in some important particulars, to those represented on the gateways of the Sanchi Tope, and other remains of a similar date, showing that great changes which have made transformations in the plains have not affected the hills.\n\nOn enquiring at Chini about the people and their caste, it was answered that there were only two classes\u2014Kati-Wallahs and Cooli-log; the first being owners or occupiers of the land, and the Coolies being the labouring population. Gerard states that there were no Brahmins to the east of Serahn, which agrees with my information. As there was no priesthood, the rites, I understood, were performed by the villagers. In relation to this unbrahminical state, it may be as well to say that Chini is close on the borders of the Lama region, and that there was a small Lama temple at Chini, the first to be found, I think, on the way eastward. It was a\nvery unimportant establishment, and only one man belonged to it, who did not wear the Lama robes, which are red in that part of the world. The mass of the villagers evidently \"belonged\"\u2014to use a familiar expression at home here\u2014to the Devi Temple.\n\nEvery morning one of the villagers\u2014I have an impression that the Kati-Wallahs only attended to the rites of the temple\u2014came to the well near the bungalow, and carried back water, and a handful of mint, which grew plentifully there. I understood that the mint was either offered to Devi, or that it was used with the water to wash the masks, in which case it would be considered that Devi had her bath on getting up in the morning.\n\nAt times the Devi was taken out, seemingly with no other object than for a hava khana, or a constitutional airing. On such occasions a few of the villagers attended, in order that a proper state of honour should be maintained. One carried a chowrie, and the musicians with their instruments followed, for the state of royalty, although in a rude condition, was always preserved. The trumpets were very large, about four or five feet long, some of them straight, and others bent in the form of a letter S. Similar trumpets are represented in one of the sculptures of the Sanchi Tope, where the upper end of the S is shaped into a serpent's head.\u00b9 The figures represented in this particular sculpture are different from all the others, and Mr. Fergusson suggested that they were people from Cabul, which is highly probable; but the Sanchi sculpture shows how old the form of the instrument is, and it may be referred to again here as another instance of an ancient type being still in existence in the Sutlej Valley.\n\nThe first festival which took place during my stay at Chini was on the 14th July. In the morning the villagers all came to the well to wash themselves and their clothes. It may be mentioned that the people are not cleanly like the Hindus of the plain, washing is not their custom, and on asking them when they had washed before, they said \"six\n\n\u00b9 See The Identification of the Sculptured Tope at Sanchi, by William Simpson, in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. XIV. Part III.\nmonths,\" and to the inquiry when they would again perform this act of cleanliness the same number of months was given. Later in the day the pujah began, and hearing the sound of it, I went over to the temple, where the villagers had turned out dressed in their best. The costume of the women is very picturesque, a woollen cloth is wrapped round the body, and is kept in its place by means of a kummerbund and a large brass brooch.\\(^1\\) The ceremony on this day, so far as I saw, was a peculiar circular dance, which was performed on the paved space on which the Dharmasalah stands, already described as being in front of the temple. In this dance the Devi was carried round in the usual way by two men with the staves on their shoulders, and each with their face towards each other. The drums and large trumpets were of course out and in full operation. The villagers, both men and women, formed a large segment of a circle, facing the dharmasalah. Each person had his or her arms twisted into those of their next neighbours behind their backs. The end man had his right hand free, and in it he held a chowrie, which he waved in the air, keeping time to the movement of the dance. This consisted of a peculiar step, half forwards, half towards the right, this last giving the progress round the centre. At the same time the half step forward was followed by a retiring movement, accompanied by a bending of the body forwards, as if bowing or salaaming to the Devi, which, with its attendants, took up the other part of the circle not occupied by the dancers. The performers continued singing all the time. The direction of the circular motion was with the left hand to the centre\\(^2\\); it is thus the opposite of the way the Lamas turn their praying wheels, and also of their custom of passing the Manies, which they invariably do with their right hand to them; by doing this in going and coming, they necessarily make a circuit round them.\n\n\\(^1\\) An exact copy of one of these brooches has been exhibited for some years in the South Kensington Museum as an Irish Celtic one. I have communicated with the authorities about it, but as they can get no satisfactory reply from the firm in Dublin who manufacture and sell it as an Irish brooch, it remains in the South Kensington Museum as a Celtic work of art. [The original of this brooch was found at Tara many years ago.\u2014Ed. J.R.A.S.]\n\n\\(^2\\) In Good Words the opposite direction is given, but on reference to my sketches, I am now convinced that what is here stated is correct.\nThese details may be of value in considering the origin of the peculiar culte they belong to. In the evening they lighted a fire, and kept up the holiday till a late hour. After going to bed I heard the instruments and the chant still going on.\n\nBeing anxious to know the words sung at this pujah, I got one of the villagers to repeat to me what seemed to be the favourite song. Here is a copy of what I wrote at the time from the man's dictation:\n\n**Okung gee tung.**\n\nGoli gohona i abi hona shung ma buna banlung na geen gae too juptak kuoo kae go la'mo zdoo koo lang tee banglung na geen Jumee ja to keema juma new dum maba zhung beshtory banglung na geen Holy zanwee pia mooloo tsompoor mooloo beshtory geese meecee sbanoo po rango yo tcha la den zangoo doong kora tootcha la shung sata sorrow gong sata sorrow gong geese meecee holy bala batson ho sata sorrow gong meecee kung bolo masung panasoo parra o rogu o tung tolo holy parra japyn o kangsha linga pay yo pia osheem gayama key na leh a go ho sho go sheem dia nia kena leh ago.\n\nI have not been able as yet to find any one who could translate these words. Mr. Vaux has tried more than one Oriental scholar, but without success. I took the words down by ear, and they may not be very correct. Not knowing the sense, I have not risked any attempt at punctuation.\n\nMy friends in the village announced to me that there would soon be another burra din, or holiday, which they gave the name of the \"Croat ke puja,\" in their patois they called it \"Croat,\" but the word is Acroat, or walnut. This took place at the village of Coati, about a mile and a half to the east of Chini, on the 4th August, exactly three weeks after the one already described. There is a small tank close to the temple, with fish in it. A friend who was with me went off one day with fishing tackle, thinking he would provide a treat for our dinner, for food supplies are not particularly\nvaried in the hills. As soon as the people understood his intention, they implored him to desist, as the fish all belonged to Devi. This had never occurred to my friend, and of course he carefully avoided any offence to their religious feelings. The pujah did not take place in the village, but at a temple in the woods close by; beside it there was a levelled space, with, in this case, two dharmsalas, and round it were some very fine Deodar trees. At such places, I understood, that these trees were never cut down except for the repair, or rebuilding of the temple; as the deodar is a cedar, closely allied botanically to the Cedars of Lebanon, we have a suggestive resemblance here to the wood which was used for Solomon's Temple. I went down to the spot early and found some of the people, principally women, busily engaged preparing small chupatties which they cooked by dipping them into boiling oil. The people gathered at this event from a number of villages round, but it was the Coat\u00ee Devi which figured in the ceremony. It would be about midday when we heard the drums and trumpets, and at last we could see the Devi coming along a path through the woods, a crowd of people with it, and some of them dancing round. It was impossible at the moment to avoid comparing it with the account of David dancing round the ark, but as it came along another comparison came to the mind,\u2014these people are in the most primitive condition, probably unchanged in anything for a thousand years. There was the magnificent scene around,\u2014the Sutlej some three thousand feet beneath, and the snowy peaks glittering some ten or twelve thousand feet overhead, add to this the forest of old trees, with the strange performance of the figures, and you have a living picture of Keats' description of the villages on the side of Latmos where the simple folks had come out to sacrifice and pass a holiday. Such impressions I am aware do not exactly belong to Archaeology, but the sense of a primitive condition of things may have its use in a record of this kind.\n\nThe Devi was duly brought along and placed in one of the dharmsalas. This day an old man appeared with a red dress, the same as that worn by the Lamas, he was the\nprincipal officiator at the ceremonies, in which he was assisted by a boy. I saw the man after the pujah, and he had put off the red dress, and appeared in the usual costume of the locality. Dilloo, which was the old man's name, first approached the Devi, and washed the faces, or masks, with mint and water; he then offered incense, and presented flowers, fruit and bread. A number of kids, some black and some white, were then brought forward; these were sprinkled with water, and one of the attendants, with an implement, shaped somewhat between a knife and a hatchet, highly ornamented,\u2014I noticed that such articles are kept in the temples, hence it may presumed they are used only on such occasions\u2014cut off one of their heads at a blow. The boy who assisted Dilloo lifted up the head, and advancing towards the Devi, presented it, muttering some words in a low voice. He touched the blood still dripping from the head with his finger, and with a jerk he flicked a drop or so, as near upon the masks as he could. After doing this once or twice, he dipped the point of his forefinger into the blood, and touched the Devi with it. The head was then deposited among the offerings. The body of the kid when it fell was so placed that the blood ran into a chillimchee or brass basin: after two or three of the kids had been despatched, and the basin was pretty well filled, it was lifted by one of the men, and presented to Devi, then turning round to the temple, with a swing of his body, the man emptied the vessel upon the wall. The sacrificing of the kids went on, and it may have been three times that the contents of the basin were thrown on the building. The wall of the temple seemed to be whitewashed, and as this is unusual in the hills, the conclusion was natural that its object was to cover up the effects of the former ceremony, and to present a clean surface for the new.\n\nThis part of the pujah seemed to be completed, and being in the autumn might have passed as a kind of harvest festival, and that which followed, as walnuts and pine cones were employed, might also have some relation to the ripening of the fruits of the earth, only it is difficult to understand how a fierce battle could be associated with such a ceremony.\nUnfortunately I was unable to get any explanation, all I learned being that it was \"dustoor\" or custom. This being the case, I can only describe what I saw. The temple had a rough balcony, which went round on the level of an upper story; Dilloo, with his red dress on, appeared in this balcony with some of the villagers, which became the signal for action, and a spirited warfare began, the missiles being the walnuts which gave the pujah its name, but pine cones were also used, and being larger, they were the more dangerous. Dilloo and his party first made the circuit of the balcony, when those below began throwing the walnuts and cones at them; the defenders soon returned the fire, covering themselves as well as they could by means of the balcony, and some of them using one or two small windows as embrasures. This lasted for about half an hour, when those in the temple returned and mixed with the others below, seemingly none the worse from the encounter; this, I understood, was not always the case, for accidents had taken place.\n\nWhile the battle had been going on, the kids had been at the same time cooking; when they were ready, the people sat down on the grass in front of the Devi, and the meat and bread were handed round\u2014one noticeable thing being that the women were served before the men.\u00b9\n\nWhen the feast was over, the Devi was lighted up, and the march back to Coati was begun. Here a very remarkable feature connected with these Devis attracted our notice. The movement towards Coati suddenly stopped, and a considerable agitation took place; the red Yak-tails that surmounted the Devi shook and bobbed up and down, while the people crowded round, and seemed very excited. On asking about the meaning of this, the answer was, \"Khuda bolta hai,\" which means the God speaks. By what means the utterance was accomplished I could not make out, but in some manner the wishes of the Devi were understood, and its desire was not to go back to Coati; being out for a holiday, it, or perhaps those around it, seemed to desire a continuation of\n\n\u00b9 A very striking resemblance to what is here described will be found in 2 Sam. xi. 17, 18, 19.\nthe day's amusement, so its wish was to go to Chini, and pay the Devi there a visit. When this became known, the villagers from Chini gave a great shout of joy at the honour of the visit. The excitement was great, and the Yak-tails shook very much, the long trumpets sounded, the drums beat, and the dancing commenced again round the Devi as it moved away to the neighbouring village, the crowd all following. The dancing was much more lively than when the Devi was first carried out from Coati.\n\nA number of the Chini Wallahs went off at once to their village, and it turned out that their object was to bring out the Devi there to receive the other. When the Coati Devi arrived, the Chini Devi was at the outskirts of the village with all its attendants, with trumpets and drums. The reception of the one Devi by the other was like two rajahs meeting; there was a great amount of shaking and bobbing, which ended by the Chini Devi getting behind, and allowing the visitor the honour of going first at the head of the procession. When the temple was reached, there was more shaking, and the Coati Devi was carried once or twice round the dharmsalah, and then into the temple. This was repeated with the other Devi, and the proceedings of that day, so far as I saw, terminated. Next morning the visitor returned to Coati, and was accompanied by the Chini Devi to the outside of the village, where, with the usual shaking, they parted, and the Chini Devi was carried back to the temple.\n\nThere is a striking resemblance in many of the details here described to that of the Mosaic ritual. Whoever will read chapter xxix. of Exodus might be almost excused for supposing that I had copied the details from that source. The putting of the tip of the finger into the blood is exactly the same as I have here recounted. If the Jewish origin of the Afghans had any foundation, I should have had no hesitation in supposing that some of these people, or their religious customs, had extended as far to the south-east as the Sutlej Valley. Dr. Bellew, in his Journal of a Political Mission to Afghanistan in 1857, gives a number of state-\nments which are in favour of the Jewish origin of the Afghans, and says, that \"the physiognomic resemblance of the Afghans to the Jews is most remarkable, and is more especially observed among the Nomad tribes of this people, and those of them who dwell among the wild and inaccessible mountains of the Sulaiman range, and in the hilly regions of the northern parts of the country.\"\u00b9 As a Jewish colony penetrated somehow into Southern India at some former date, and another reached a spot in the centre of China in some mysterious way, a Jewish origin of the ceremonies I have described may not be altogether impossible; on this account I shall make a quotation from Dr. Bellew's work, which he gives from one of the Afghan Tawarikh or Histories. It is regarding the Ark of the Covenant which the Afghans seem, according to it, to have had with them, and it may be stated that the Afghans call themselves the \"Beni Israil.\"\n\n\"The Ark of the Covenant (Tabut i Sakina) was the oracle of the Bani Israil. It is generally believed to have been a box of Shamshad wood, on which were figured the forms of all the prophets of God. In length it was three cubits (A'rish), and its breadth was two cubits. It was sent to Adam from Paradise, and Adam at his death bequeathed it to his son Seth (Shish), and so on it was handed down from generation to generation to Moses. Ibn 'Abbas says that it was a basin of pure gold, in which the hearts of the prophets of God were washed and purified. According to the learned Muhajid, it was an image in the form of a cat. It had a head and tail, and each eye was like a torch. Its forehead was formed of emeralds, the brilliance of which was so great that no one had the power to look in them. In the time of battle, it moved forward like the wind, and overpowered the enemies of the Bani Israil; and the Bani Israil, when they heard the sound of its rushing, knew that victory was on their side. On the day of battle, it was always placed in front of their camps; and when the oracle moved, the Bani\n\n\u00b9 p. 66.\nIsrael advanced; and when it stood still, the Bani Israel also held fast. Habb bin Mania says it was an oracle or command ('Amr) from the Spirit of God, and that it spake words, and that whenever any difficulty arose before any of the Bani Israel, they represented their case before the 'Amri Khuda, and acted on its reply.\"\n\nBeing looked upon as a God, having the power of speech, and causing the people to follow it, are sufficiently near as points of resemblance to the Devis to justify the above quotation. I do not chance to know what value is attached to these Ta'arikhs, but it may be suspected that this legend of Jewish descent of the Afghans arose in some way after their conversion to Mohammedanism; there are legends about Ali having been in many parts of Afghanistan,\u2014Ali Musjid being one of the places which derives its name from him; the tombs of Lamech, Lot, and others, which are now noted shrines in Afghanistan, may be cited as illustrations of the same kind.\n\nIt may be of interest in connection with this subject to point out that the Arks of the Egyptians were looked upon very much as these Afghan Arks and the Himalayan Devis seem to have been. Sir Gardner Wilkinson states that \"when the shrine reached the temple, it was received with every demonstration of respect by the officiating priest, who was appointed to do duty upon the day of the festival: and if the King happened to be there, it was his privilege to perform the appointed ceremonies. These consisted of sacrifices and prayers; and the shrine was decked with fresh-gathered flowers and rich garlands. An endless profusion of offerings were placed before it on several separate altars.\" Macrobius speaks of these arks,\u2014\"being carried forward according to divine inspiration, whithersoever the Deity urges them, and not by their own will.\"\n\nAlthough these resemblances are very striking, and may possibly be connected by links which our knowledge has not\n\n1 pp. 49, 50.\n2 Ant. Egypta, vol. ii. p. 274.\n3 Saturn. i. 30.\nyet reached, I am inclined towards another explanation. If an origin can be found in India, it would on that account be more likely to be the true one; and I suspect that these pujahs of the Himalayas are only a variety of the Rath Yatra. To most people unacquainted with India the Rath Yatra, or Car Festival, is associated only with Jagan-natha (Jagganath) at Puri, but this is not so; cars are kept in the temples over the whole of Southern India, and the festival is celebrated every year throughout this region, and I think it is also common in Bengal. Although now a ceremony connected with Hinduism, we have evidence that the Buddhists also had a similar festival. Fah-Hian, in the beginning of the fifth century, describes a Buddhist Car Festival at Patna, and another at Khoten; from which we see that this practice extended over a wide extent of space, Khoten being about 300 miles due north of Chini, and on the other side of the Himalayas, thus showing that the ceremony was in all probability common to the whole of India, and even to districts beyond. If this festival was common to the whole of India, including the Himalayas, it is very easy to understand that, wherever there were no roads in which to wheel a car, the god, or symbol of a god, would have to be carried on men's shoulders. In the Himalayas the roads are only \"Pugdundies,\" the word meaning a path or trail made by the feet of a single person passing. A traveller will soon realize what this condition means, for as soon as he enters the hills he has to leave all carriages, carts, and horses behind, he must walk himself, and all luggage is carried in kilts on the backs of coolies. Of course, a large object like the car of Jagan-natha could not be carried by two men, and the size would be made to suit the circumstances; this would explain the small size of the Devis in comparison to the Rathas.\n\nI understand that in the present day, with the exception of Jagan-natha, none of the Hindu divinities are ever placed in car sat any of the pujahs. Surya is certainly represented\n\n1 The Antiquities of Orissa, by Rajendralala Mitra, LL.D., vol. ii. p. 135.\nin sculptures with a car. Cars are used with the Jain saints Paravanatha and Mahavira. Cars in connection with deities are of very frequent mention in the Vedas. There is a most wonderful description of one on which Brihaspati stands. It is described as a \"luxurious, awful, foe-subduing, raksha-slaying, cow-pen-cleaving, heaven-reaching, chariot of the ceremonial.\" In the description of the city of Ayodhya in the Ramayana is the following,\u2014\u201cAbove all, there were the sacred and resplendent chariots of the gods.\u201d These numerous allusions to cars, I think, help to confirm my suggestion that ceremonies in which they figured were more common than in the present day. \u201cIn some of the Tantras a car has been enjoined for Durg\u00e1, but they are the most modern works of their class, and the indications in them of the imitation Vaishnava ritual are obvious.\u201d As Durg\u00e1 is Kali, or Devi, in that terrible form to which sacrifice and blood are offered, this quotation from Rajendralala Mitra is of some value in reference to the Himalayan pujahs. In his work on Orissa there is another short quotation which I must give,\u2014it refers to the Parashur\u00e1m\u00e1shtami Yatr\u00e1, one of the ceremonies connected with the great temple of Bhuvanesvara; it \u201cis celebrated on the 8th of the waxing moon in the month of Ash\u00e1dha (June-July), by taking the proxy to the temple of Parashur\u00e1me\u015bvara, and there entertaining it with flowers, incense, music and dancing. The vehicle used in this procession is called a Vimana, a kind of sedan chair carried on men\u2019s shoulders. These visits constitute a peculiar feature of the local custom, as it is almost unknown in other parts of India.\u201d This quotation shows that the carrying of gods on the shoulders of men, which is done in almost every village of the Sutlej valley, is all but unknown to the plains of India.\n\nIn the yearly ceremony at Puri, Jagan-natha is carried along the Baradand, to the Gundicha Garh, which is a summer house in a garden; this has a very strong resemblance\n\n1 Rig-Veda, ii. 23; Muir\u2019s Sanscrit Texts, vol. v. p. 276.\n2 The Antiquities of Orissa, by Rajendralala Mitra, vol. ii. p. 135.\n3 Ibid. vol. ii. p. 79.\nto carrying the Devi to the temple in the wood. Of course the sacrifices and offerings of blood could find no place in the worship of Jagan-natha. As we have in the modern Lama system of Tibet, the strange and incongruous mixture of the worship of Siva with the system of Buddha, it is not surprising to find the sanguinary rites of Devi interwoven into a festival which was most probably at one time connected with the humane teachings of Sakya Muni. On the inaccessible parts of the hills, which seem to have been so little liable to change, if, in the pre-Buddhist period, as is most probable, there existed a worship of a fierce and terrible form of the deity, the chances are that this worship was never quite obliterated, and that it only took on a veneer of Buddhism. If this has been the case, then in these pujahs of the Sutlej valley we have perhaps the most perfect remains of some of the oldest ceremonies to be found in India.\n\nI have given the dates of the pujahs in the Sutlej Valley. I think it was Colonel Sykes who first noticed that the date, as given by Fah-Hian, of the Car Festival at Khoten, agreed with that of the date of the Rath Yatra of Jagan-natha. The date of the latter is on the second day of the waxing moon of Ashadha; I have not at hand the means of knowing what date that would be for 1860, the year I was at Chini; but by means of a Bombay Almanac for 1874, the Rath Yatra of that year was on the 16th July, and the first pujah I saw at Chini\u2014the one at which the six-monthly washing of clothes took place\u2014was on the 14th July. The date of the one is thus very close upon the other, and this Himalayan ceremony may become an important link between the Vaishnava Car Festival at Puri and the Buddhist one at Khoten.\n\nThe second pujah I take to have been connected in some way with the harvest, but of the battle with the walnuts and pine cones I cannot pretend to offer the slightest explanation. The only instance of fighting as a religious ceremony that I have chanced upon in reading is contained in a passage of Herodotus. It is this: \"In Papremis they offer sacrifices and perform ceremonies, as in other places;\"\nbut, when the sun is on the decline, a few priests are occupied about the image, but the greater number stand, with wooden clubs, at the entrance of the temple; while others, accomplishing their vows, amounting to more than a thousand men, each armed in like manner, stand in a body on the opposite side. But the image, placed in a small wooden temple, gilded all over, they carry out to another sacred dwelling; then the few who were left about the image draw a four-wheeled carriage, containing the temple and the image that is in it. But the priests, who stand at the entrance, refuse to give them admittance; and the votaries bringing succour to the god, oppose, and then strike, whereupon an obstinate combat with clubs ensues, and they break one another's heads, and, as I conjecture, many die of their wounds; though the Egyptians deny that any one dies.\"\u00b9\n\nThere is much in this that resembles the Himalayan ceremony, and the car with the temple and image in it, is, so far as the description goes, a perfect counter-part to the Rath of Jagan-natha. Herodotus gives the Egyptian explanation of the ceremony, but unfortunately it throws no light on our subject.\n\nTo these ceremonies of the Sutlej Valley I shall add a very few notes on what I saw the next year at Jumnotri. The nearest village to that place is Karsali, and chancing to halt for a day or two, a pujah took place on the 30th May, and lasted for some days. It came on to rain, which interrupted the performances, and this cause also interfered with my observations. I have already described their Devi, and when I chanced to see it carried, they ran about with it in a much quicker way than at Chini. There was no dancing round it so far as I saw. The men stood in one row, and the women in another; both men and women had in their head-dress bunches of a pale yellow grass, which I understood had been grown in the dark in order to get it of this peculiar tint. On the 2nd of June, after a heavy rain in the forenoon, I went over to the village, and found that the Devi\n\n\u00b9 Herodotus, ii. 63.\nand all the people had moved to a small temple outside of the village. Here I found the girls dancing by themselves; while the men were earnestly engaged at a peculiar ceremony. There was a Brahmin here, who seemed to be connected with the temple. His name was Roop Ram, his figure was tall, and he stood in the centre of a crowd seemingly taller than ever. I found that he was standing on the sharp edges of two of the sacrificial hatchets, which were held on the ground by some of the men. Roop Ram talked in a very excited way, and at last put his hand into a dish in which were what seemed to be grains of corn; taking some in his hand he dashed them in a man's face standing near. A third hatchet was placed in advance, and Roop Ram moved forward a step\u2014he was supported all the time by men on each side to keep him from falling\u2014and at every step a hatchet was moved in advance for his foot. At each of these movements a villager stood near, and Roop Ram's excited words seemed to have reference to him, and corn was in every instance dashed on the face. Each step with the talking took about a minute. He must have gone about thirty steps after my arrival, when the performance terminated, when they all ran over to the Devi. It was lifted in the usual way by two men, who ran about with it as fast as they could, and the usual music making as much din as possible. I had a conversation afterward with Roop Ram, who told me it was a yearly custom, but he applied the word \"Khelna\" or game, to it, and yet it was evidently part of a pujah. He showed me the soles of his feet; they were not in the least injured, and he explained that he was not hurt, for the god was in him. He stated that he could do the same thing on swords as sharp as my penknife. I asked if I could do it. He said, \"No.\" I pointed to a coolie, and asked if he could. Again he said, \"No.\" Only a Brahmin, I understood, could walk under such circumstances: his father had done it every year before him, and his son would succeed to the office, and would do it when he was dead. This was all I learned regarding this pujah.\nART. III.\u2014On some New Discoveries in Southern India. By ROBERT SEWELL, M.R.A.S., Madras Civil Service.\n\nI have the pleasure to announce to the Society the recent discovery at K\u0101\u00f1chipura, the capital of the Pallava Dynasty of Southern India, of some ancient temples, the importance of which in the history of Dravidian architecture it would, I think, be difficult to overrate. The present paper is put forward merely by way of notifying the existence of these temples, and of calling attention to them; there is reason to hope that ere long reliable details will be laid before the public in the shape of photographs, plans, and drawings, prepared by the Archaeological Survey of Southern India under the superintendence of Dr. Burgess.\n\nThe city of K\u0101\u00f1chipura (Anglic\u00e9 Conjeveram) is a very ancient one. The Pallava Dynasty, which was entirely overthrown by the Cholas in the eleventh century A.D., appears to have been one of the most important dynasties in the peninsula for several centuries previous to that period. According to tradition, apparently believed in from a remote date, certainly as early as the eleventh century (vide the Chalukyan inscriptions), the first Chalukya established his sovereignty in the peninsula about the fifth century A.D. by conquest of territory from the Pallavas, south of the Ner-budda; the Pallavas at that time ruling over the most part of the Dakhan and the eastern coast of the peninsula, but having the P\u0101ndiyan and Chola Dynasties to their south. Their capital, K\u0101\u00f1chipura, which is situated about thirty miles S.W. of Madras, was near their southern boundary. The city was always remarkable for the beauty of its sculptures, if we may believe the testimony of an early Chalukyan inscription, which relates how the brother of the sovereign\nof Kaly\u0101napura fought against and defeated the Pallavas, seized the capital and entered it in triumph; for it is therein stated that the victor was so much struck with the beauty of the sculptures and temples in the conquered city that he refrained from injuring it in the slightest degree, and even went so far as to cover the statue of R\u0101jasi\u1e43ha\u015bcara with gold, in order to create a lasting memorial of his admiration. K\u0101\u00f1chipura is therefore a city where naturally one would search for temples and sculptures of older date than most of those so plentifully strewn over Southern India, few of which have yet been found earlier than the eleventh century, the period of the palmy days of the Cholas.\n\nBy that time a style of architecture had been established which was destined to remain almost unchanged, or at least unchanged in its main arrangements and details, for eight centuries. As regards its shrines, the idea universally prevalent was that of a building divided into not less than two divisions, viz. an adytum entered and lighted by a single door opening into a little hall. Often, in the more pretentious shrines, this hall opens into others, larger and pillar-supported, called mandapams. But whatever number there may be, the hall nearest the adytum is remarkably dark and mysterious in character, surrounded by solid unbroken walls and entered by a door generally opposite the entrance to the shrine, which door affords almost its only light. When the temple is a small one it consists of only a shrine and hall, and in this case the building from outside presents the appearance of a solid mass of masonry unbroken except by the single door, and surmounted by a gopura, or pyramidal tower of two or three stories, terminating in a member called the kalasa.\n\nNow the idea governing the structure of the \"Seven Pagodas,\" the well-known monolithic temples or Rathas at Mah\u0101vallipura, which, according to the best authorities, date from the period A.D. 650 to 700, or thereabouts, was different from this, as will be gathered from a perusal of the \"Cave Temples\" of Mr. Fergusson and Dr. Burgess. In these the hall was open, like the main chamber of the\nappear to be of date coeval with the Rathas. In other words, the whole front of the larger chamber was exposed by the cutting away of the rock, and the hall then represented a sort of piazza, sometimes walled in on three sides, but entirely open on the fourth. In the back wall of rock was cut, in the case of the caves, one or more cells, the centre one of which was the adytum. The front of the cave or Ratha was supported by two or more pillars of a peculiar shape, one of which is figured on p. 119 of Meers. Fergusson and Burgess's work, from a drawing by Mr. Chisholm.\n\nRegarding these pillars Mr. Fergusson writes: \"They are all of the same pattern, which, in fact, with very slight modification, is universal at Mah\u00e2vallipur. They all have bases representing Y\u00e2lis and conventional lions, with spreading capitals...\" And again (p. 115): \"They are the most characteristic features of the architecture of the place, being almost universal at Mah\u00e2vallipur, but not found anywhere else that I know of.\" I may state, in passing, that I have seen several of these in different parts of the country close to Mah\u00e2vallipur, but none at any distance. They are all in the Pallava country.\n\nWith this, by way of introduction, I return to the newly-discovered K\u00e2\u00f1chipura temples. It was in May last that I observed them first, and since then I have examined them several times, once in company with Mr. Alexander Rea, of the School of Art. They have been cleared by my orders of noxious vegetation, which threatened to do them very serious injury, and now only await careful inspection by the Archaeological Surveyor.\n\nThese temples are three in number, and stand not far from the Railway Station. Two are dedicated to \u0160iva, one to Vish\u1e47u. The latter, and one of the \u0160iva temples, stand in the outskirts of the town; the other \u0160iva temple, almost a pair to the first, is rather more among the houses. We will consider the \u0160iva temples first, and a description of one will answer for both. Any one familiar with the usual forms of Dravidian architecture will at once recognize the difference between this and the ordinary Hindu fane, and will, I think,\nnot fail to appreciate the extreme importance of the discovery. The temple is, to begin with, constructed entirely of stone from top to bottom, almost all the pyramidal parts of South Indian temples being made of bricks plastered over. The two storeys of the tower are distinct storeys; the simulated cells, so characteristic a feature of the style, with their retaining wall, being quite distinct from the body of the tower in each case, a sure test of age. The chambers below are two in number, the vim\u00e2na, over which rises the tower, and the mandapam or entrance-hall. The floor of the entrance-hall is very high above the ground, and there are now no steps up to it, so that broken slabs have been piled up to make temporary steps. Once inside the mandapam, any visitor acquainted with the subject must be startled to find that he is actually standing inside one of the Mah\u00e2vallipur caves. There is the same chamber entirely open to the front, walled in on three sides, and supported on four pillars of precisely the type alluded to above, with the lion bases and spreading capitals. There are its half-pillars in continuation of those standing free, dividing the walls of the hall into panels. And, more characteristic perhaps than anything else, all the panels in the walls are richly sculptured with groups in high relief, representing subjects similar to those treated of in, for instance, the Yamapuri or Mahishamaraddani cave at Mah\u00e2vallipur (\"Cave Temples,\" pp. 145\u2013147). In the case of one of the \u0160iva temples, the outer walls are covered with inscriptions in the old Tamil character, which await decipherment (I had no leisure to examine them carefully), and on one pillar I noticed two letters of the Cave character, such as is used on the Rathas at Mah\u00e2vallipur.\n\nSo far as my experience goes these two temples are unique, and I should not be surprised to find that after careful examination, experts declare them to be coeval with the Rathas and Caves.\n\nIt may be suggested that the caves must be older than any structural building now standing. Possibly; but is it not almost certain that the caves were imitations of structural buildings, and not the reverse, when we find the fa\u00e7ade of\nalmost every cave at Mah\u0101vallipur sculptured in imitation of the simulated cells and retaining wall, which stood free over the fa\u00e7ade of the oldest-known structural temples? The cave-fronts would not be so sculptured except in imitation of structural buildings, whether in wood or stone, which bore those peculiar features. I do not assert that these particular \u015aiva temples at K\u0101\u00f1chipura are necessarily older than the caves, but I think there is no reason why they should not be. Even if they are coeval, or a little later in date, I believe these temples to be four centuries older than any structural temple yet discovered, and therefore to be of extreme importance in the history of Dravidian architecture.\n\nThe Vishnu temple is different. Unfortunately it is still used for worship, and appears to be in the keeping of a number of priests, remarkable for their bigotry. I could see nothing except from quite outside, and cannot therefore describe the lower storey, owing to the principal building being surrounded by a high wall, which prevented me from seeing anything but the pyramidal tower above the rim\u0101na. The wall is of extreme age, so that the stones of which it is composed, and which have not long since been taken down and replaced in position, seem almost as if made of coal rather than granite, they are so black and weather-worn. A peculiar feature of this wall is that at all corners stands a Y\u0101lli, as if to protect the edifice within. The tower is older in character than any other I have seen elsewhere. It rises in distinct storeys, consisting of platforms, each less than the other, and each surrounded by a row of simulated cells and retaining wall, and presents precisely the appearance of the Dharmar\u0101ja Ratha at Mah\u0101vallipur (\"Cave Temples,\" pp. 124, 125). Just as in that case, some, at least, of the panels of the tower-walls are sculptured with figures, probably of deities.\n\nWhile the interior of the two \u015aiva temples, therefore, represents exactly the caves at Mah\u0101vallipur, the Vishnu temple from outside is a structural reproduction of the Dharmar\u0101ja Ratha. Which is the older? At present it is impossible to say, but it is extremely interesting to find these\nentirely new types of temples of hoary antiquity at the capital of the Pallavas, when it is believed that the Pallavas were the sculptors of the monoliths on the sea.\n\nWith these samples before us, and the fact of the existence of the Chalukyan inscription referred to, which praises K\u0101\u00f1chipura in the seventh century as being a city remarkable for its beautiful sculptures, I think we may fairly assume that sculpture and architecture was further advanced amongst the Pallavas of the fourth century than has been supposed. At least these newly-discovered structural temples will form an interesting subject for study to those concerned in investigating the origin and course of temple-architecture amongst the Dravidians.\n\nThere are a number of other most interesting relics of great age in and about K\u0101\u00f1chipura; amongst others, some very remarkable pillar-bases, sculptured each with three figures of woodmen or soldiers about four feet high, which I cannot help thinking represent the Ku\u1e5fumbars of those days.\n\nMr. Fergusson has called attention to the curious apsidal shape of the gopura of the Sah\u0101deva Ratha at Mah\u0101vallipur (\"Cave Temples,\" pp. 135\u2013139). Another example not far from Mah\u0101vallipur, at the village of Manimarigalam, has long been known, though all are not aware that the entire tower of this latter gopura is made of brick and plaster, and not of stone. I have found some further examples. One is at a little temple in K\u0101\u00f1chipura, amongst the trees, on the way (one way at least) from the Tahsildar's office to the Jain temple near the river. Two are to be seen inside the last-mentioned Jain temple; while a portion of a small temple at Vandal\u016br (a railway station on the South Indian Railway) shows an apsidal base, though it has no cupola.\n\nOne very interesting and, as far as I know, unique variety of form is to be seen in the construction of a temple at Uttramall\u016br, not far from K\u0101\u00f1chipura. Here is a temple having three shrines one above another, the tower not being composed simply of the usual pyramidal form, but consisting of three storeys, each containing the statue of one of the many forms of Vish\u1e47u in a rim\u0101na, with a ma\u1e47\u1e0dapam outside\nit, and an entrance court or platform, the whole surmounted by a kalasa. The tower is not one pyramidal block, but consists of a central block in which are the chambers mentioned above, having round it a number of smaller gopuras in a picturesque cluster, each surmounting one of the numerous mandapams erected round the several shrines. The effect of this group of towers, rising up to the central dome-like member above, is exceedingly architectural and picturesque, and it is much to be regretted that the builders of South India did not, as in this instance, allow their fancy more play when constructing their temples, and so save us from the dreary monotony which characterizes their style.\nART. IV.\u2014On the Importance to Great Britain of the Study of Arabic. By Habib Anthony Salmon\u00e9, M.R.A.S.\n\nI believe that the short paper on this subject which I propose to read to you will be interesting to this ancient association for the cultivation of Oriental research in all its branches; but, for it, I lay no claim to any special qualifications for its discussion; on the contrary, I approach it with much diffidence, in the presence of men my seniors in science and erudition. This consideration, however, is the main ground of my encouragement; for, according to the Arabic adage \"Indulgence is an innate quality of the liberal,\" I feel assured beforehand of a lenient judgment from you.\n\nI am only stating what I have heard on all sides, when I say that the study of Arabic is almost wholly neglected in this country. A gentleman of wide experience recently told me that the number of Englishmen conversant with this language might be counted on the fingers of one hand. And this, notwithstanding the fact that Her Majesty the Queen rules over a larger number of Muhammadans than any other Potentate, and that with these, the Kur\u0101n is their Book of Divine Inspiration, their rule of Faith, their code of Civil and Criminal Law, their universal Directory in all matters intrinsic and extrinsic to themselves. So widespread has Arabic become through this medium, so large has been its influence in the composition of indigenous Oriental dialects, that any one tolerably acquainted with Arabic could scarcely fail to find people in every Muslim country with whom he could more or less freely communicate. When in Syria and Egypt, I frequently remarked how pleased the natives were when addressed by a Franjy or European in\ntheir own language; and it stands to reason, that a British Official, so qualified, would have a far better chance of eliciting information from the people of those countries and of making a favourable impression upon them than one incapable, owing to his ignorance of their vernacular, of exchanging any ideas with them. I do not mean to say that these remarks hold good of the East universally; but I unhesitatingly affirm that a knowledge of Arabic on the part of an European exercises a much greater influence among Orientals of all classes than a corresponding knowledge, say of French or Italian, exercises among Frenchmen or Italians.\n\nPermit me now to illustrate the utility of the knowledge of Arabic in a particular case, such as that of an Eastern campaign. I readily grant that primary success must be mainly due to the operations of the expedition, directed by the skill of its commander, and to the individual efforts of the soldiers engaged in it. But military triumph alone seldom succeeds in securing what is an important element in perfect success; I mean friendliness, on the part of the population, towards an army of occupation. But what more effectual means to secure this\u2014what more potent means to conciliate national prejudices, and, in addition thereto, to remove misconceptions, and obtain security against treachery\u2014than a free communication with the subdued inhabitants by intelligent officers, able to converse with them in their own language? Local native interpreters, however trustworthy and efficient, are at the best a sorry alternative in such cases, to say nothing of the natural antipathy they generally evoke on the part of their co-religionists or fellow-countrymen.\n\nIt is true, and I sincerely hope it will always be true, that armed British intervention in the East has uniformly been successful, with or without the linguistic advantages on the importance of which I am insisting. On the other hand, it will hardly be disputed that possession of such advantages would have tended to lubricate, so to speak, much of that friction which hostilities necessarily engender between the conquerors and the conquered\u2014a friction, which has given rise before now to misunderstandings and complications not\nto be overcome by the most splendid achievements of a victorious army.\n\nConsiderations such as these\u2014bearing in mind the vast and complex interests of Great Britain in the East\u2014have always excited my astonishment, that this country, instead of being the first to provide instruction in Arabic for the pupils in its principal Civil, Military, and Naval Colleges, is, unquestionably, the last and least provident in this respect. Other nations are not so careless and supine. It is well known that the Propaganda at Rome maintains a constant succession of pupils in the Eastern languages, notably Arabic, whose services are at the disposal of the College at all times. Moreover, unless I am altogether mis-informed, Russia is equally foreseeing in this respect. At the Imperial College of Kazan a constant succession of pupils intended for the three services is maintained, who receive regular instruction, under competent masters, in the Oriental languages. Thence, after keeping so many terms in College, these \u00e9l\u00e8ves are sent out in pairs to explore the several countries in which they are destined to be employed, and to study the vernacular dialects of each district; thus the Russian Government has always at hand a number of young men, Civil as well as Military, adequately prepared to undertake any duties in the East which may be allotted to them. In like manner, Austria supports an Oriental College at Vienna; while France has its \"Ecole pour les langues Orientales vivantes.\" Germany, also, and even Denmark, are far ahead of England in promoting the general study of Oriental languages.\n\nNow, a fact may be generally known, without meeting with the consideration it deserves. So I do not doubt for a moment that the facts which I have adduced regarding the importance of the study of Arabic to the multiform interests of Great Britain in the East, as also to the English antiquary, merchant, and traveller, would be accepted, generally, in all parts of this country. Hence, I do not pretend to furnish any special information on that score, my sole object being, as far as in me lies, to urge such a recognition of admitted facts as may lead to practical results.\nWhen it is said of French that it is the language of Europe, the phrase has an undeniable significance, extending as it does to every branch of international intercommunication.\n\nIn an equally significant sense, that Arabic is the French of the East will hardly be disputed by those who have a competent knowledge of its widespread prevalence and influence.\n\nI am greatly tempted here to dilate on the vast field for literary research which a study of Arabic opens out to the Western student; but my object on this occasion being mainly practical, I shall content myself with quoting the following passage on the subject from the pen of Mr. Bosworth-Smith, of Harrow:\u2014\"During the darkest period of European history the Arabs for five hundred years held up the torch of learning to humanity. It was the Arabs who then 'called the Muses from their ancient seats'; who collected and translated the writings of the great Greek masters; who understood the geometry of Apollonius, and wielded the weapons found in the logical armoury of Aristotle. It was the Arabs who developed the sciences of agriculture and astronomy, and created those of algebra and chemistry; who adorned their cities with colleges and libraries, as well as with mosques and palaces; who supplied Europe with a school of philosophers from Cordova, and with a school of physicians from Salerno.\" In the same strain, albeit with more especial reference to the widespread influence which this language has exerted throughout the East, my learned friend, Dr. Badger, remarks in the preface to his English-Arabic Lexicon, \"Arabic is, furthermore, the sacred language of the Muslims throughout the world, and since the early conquests of Isl\u00e2m has formed an integral part of several of the living languages of the East. The modern Persian, Turkish, and Hindust\u00e2ni, are so permeated with it, that a thorough mastery of those tongues can hardly be attained without a competent acquaintance with the Arabic.\" To the above, I may add the following quotation from a notice in the Times on \"Recent Oriental Languages.\" Speaking of Arabic, the writer remarks that \"it is in construction one\nof the most perfect Oriental languages, and as a means of training and developing the mental faculties, its study will compare favourably with that of Latin and Greek. Indeed, so freely do Arabic words enter into all the Mahomedan languages of the East, that Arabic bears even a closer relation to them than the classical languages bear to the vernaculars of Europe.\u201d One other advantage attending the study of Arabic I venture to allude to very briefly, namely, the aid which it affords to Biblical research. The Semitic origin of Arabic and Hebrew is universally admitted; and, further, most of the words met with in the latter are found in the former. But whereas Hebrew can hardly now be termed a living tongue, its sister-language, the Arabic, still lives in its pristine vigour to throw light on many points, which, without its aid, would be dark and enigmatical in the Biblical Hebrew.\n\nI am aware of a prevalent idea that the Arabic is a language very difficult of acquirement. A would-be student looks at the strange characters, with their numerous dia-critical points, vowel symbols, and other syllabic signs, and is bewildered at the complex array. Hearing, on further enquiry, that the triliteral verb alone has no less than twelve conjugations, he is fairly appalled at the task before him, and forthwith abandons it in despair: yet, strange as the Arabic characters may seem at first sight, they are formed on a system so intelligible as to be easily mastered in a very short time. A little instruction, moreover, under competent tuition, would suffice to convince a novice that the twelve conjugations, instead of constituting an additional difficulty, contribute greatly, not only to the richness, but to the facility of acquiring the language. While on this subject, I beg permission to quote the following remarks by Dr. Badger on the study of Arabic:\u2014\u201cHad I a son, whom I did not intend for one of the professions requiring an adequate knowledge of the exact sciences, instead of having him taught mathematics, I would make him learn Arabic; for, in my judgment, no better discipline for the mental faculties exists than that afforded by the grammatical structure of that language.\nTake for example the triliteral etymon. Springing therefrom in regular order are twelve boughs, representing the twelve conjugations. From each of these issue a succession of branches and branchlets, representing our infinitive nouns, participles, adjectives, nouns of time, place, species, instrument, etc., all formed on explicit rules which seldom or never vary. What better training for the mind than to grasp those rules, and to be enabled thereby to trace at a glance, the derivative in any of the branches, together with its signification, down to the root. The study of mathematics, except in the case above reserved, is not a whit more generally subservient to mental cultivation than this,\u2014and there it stops; whereas the study of Arabic gives one, in addition thereto, the knowledge of a living language of immense practical utility.\"\n\nHitherto, a much more plausible drawback to the acquirement of Arabic has been the paucity of elementary and other works for the use of English students. The drawback, as regards elementary books, still exists, though by no means to the extent which was the case a few years ago. Professor W. Wright has provided an admirable Arabic Grammar, far surpassing in value any previously extant, and the late lamented Professor Palmer has left behind him a useful Arabic Manual. On the score of Dictionaries, the great want which has hitherto prevailed is being adequately supplied by the progressive publication of the late Mr. Lane's magnificent Arabic-English Lexicon, a perfect thesaurus which leaves nothing to be desired; and more recently still, by Dr. Badger's equally valuable English-Arabic Lexicon, pronounced by the best authorities to be the most perfect work of the kind ever published; add to these, also, the late Professor Dozy's \"Supplement aux Dictionnaires Arabes.\" With these efficient aids at hand, no English student can henceforth justly complain of the want of sufficient educational books to enable him to acquire Arabic.\n\nIn conclusion, I ought to state that some of my friends have advised me to abandon my endeavour to advocate the study of Arabic in this country, predicting that they would\nmeet with nothing but indifference and apathy; in fact, that they will supply another example of the truth of the Arabic adage, by being \u0643\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062d\u062f\u064a\u0628 \u0628\u0627\u0631\u0643 as vain \u201cas the blows struck on cold iron,\u201d emitting sound, indeed, but otherwise absolutely ineffectual. I am happy to say, however, that many eminent men have already recognized my exertions in behalf of a wider cultivation of Arabic in the Civil and Military Colleges of England; and that I have received many encouraging letters from others who have not been able to be present to-day to express their own views on this subject.\nART. V.\u2014Grammatical Note on the Gwamba Language in South Africa. By Paul Berthoud, Missionary of the Canton de Vaud, Switzerland, Stationed at Vald\u00e9zia, Spelonken, Transvaal. [Prepared at the request of Mr. R. N. Cust, Hon. Secretary.]\n\nI. GEOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION.\n\nA. The Name.\n\nThe Gwamba language belongs to the South-Eastern Branch of the Bantu family of languages, according to Dr. Bleek's system of classification. But this language was never known under its true name, until the Swiss missionaries settled among the Ma-Gwamba people and studied their language. In his Comparative Grammar Dr. Bleek calls it by the name of Tekeza; and, complaining of the scanty materials which he could get, he says (\u00a7 32): \"Tekeza dialects are known to us only through short vocabularies.\"\n\nConsidering the scarcity of information which Dr. Bleek could gather about that language, it is really remarkable that he has been able to understand so well its particular features. Still, it is doubtful whether this name of \"Tekeza\" could to-day be heard anywhere in South Africa; whilst, on the other hand, we find that the Ma-Gwamba people are actually making use of the same words which are given in Bleek's Vocabularies of Lourenzo-Marqu\u00e8s.\n\nTill now the people who speak Gwamba have been known under various names, of which the most largely applied was that of Ama-Tonga. This is the word Tonga with a Zulu Prefix. But it also appears on geographical maps with the Gwamba Prefix, and then takes the form of Ba-Tonga. But again this latter word sounds too nasal and too soft for a Suto-speaking organ, and consequently a Suto man turns it into Ba-Toka, as some Geographers write it. But whatever may be its orthography and its pronunciation, that name is\nsomewhat improper, because it has been given not only to Gwamba people, but also to different tribes which are not of the same blood. Nevertheless, it is used very often, so much so that the Ma-Gwamba have accepted it to a certain extent, and that they sometimes call their native land by the name of \"Tonga.\"\n\nKnobnoses (in Dutch Knopneuzen) is another name which has been largely applied to the Ma-Gwamba. Its Boer origin is easily detected by the form of the word. It was given to those people on account of their special fashion of tattooing, by which they cause warts of the size and shape of a pea to develope along the top line of the nose to the very point, and also around the eyes. Of course this tattooing gives to their face a horrid appearance. Fortunately that absurd fashion is gradually diminishing and being abandoned, so that before long the name of Knobnoses will no more be appropriate nor applicable.\n\nA third name which has been applied to Ma-Gwamba is that of Ba-Hloekwa, which is the same as Ba-Hlenqwe, but pronounced thus by different people. This name is right enough, but it must be restrained to only a fraction of the large Gwamba tribe; for the Ba-Hlengwe are but the Ma-Gwamba of the north, that is, north of the river Limpopo, and the name cannot be extended farther, neither applied to the whole tribe.\n\nA fourth name, that of Ma-Koapa, also spelt Ma-Koaba, is to be found on maps. It is only a corruption of the word \"Ma-Gwamba,\" which is the right name of that tribe. This corruption must have arisen from the accidental fact that some explorers, who came into contact with those people, did not know their language, could not speak with them and had to depend upon Ba-Suto guides and interpreters. I may mention that the same thing happened once to myself. Then, Ba-Suto people cannot pronounce the word \"Ma-Gwamba,\" they find it too soft and too nasal, and therefore they change it into \"Ma-Koapa.\" Again, a German traveller would make this \"Ma-Koaba.\" That explanation is not a mere fancy, for it is based upon real facts and experience.\nAs a rule, a large tribe has not, as such, any proper and general name. But the tribe being divided in a certain number of clans, each one of these smaller communities goes by its proper name; wherefore it is incumbent on the foreigner, either black or white, to apply a generic name to all the people and clans which belong to the same tribe. The propriety then, of such a generic name, lies in its being related to the special character of the tribe, and in its being taken from the tribe's own language.\n\nThis is the case with the name \"Ma-Gwamba.\" The people of that tribe have a belief that there is an evil spirit which is always trying to do harm, and which they call \"Gwambe.\" Very often, when a man has a trouble of some kind, he wishes it back to the evil spirit, and says: \"Let it go back to Gwambe!\" It is from that circumstance that the people of this tribe received from their neighbours the appellation of \"Ma-Gwamba,\" which means \"people of Gwambe.\" This name was adopted by the people because it suited them perfectly. However, according to the grammatical rules of the language, the prefix should really be Ba, instead of Ma. But a word like Ba-Gwamba would sound very inharmoniously to their ear; and consequently, for euphony's sake, they have taken the only other suitable prefix which could replace Ba, and they call themselves Mu-Gwamba, whilst a singular person will be called a Mo-Gwamba.\n\nFrom that word they have also named their language, which, according to grammatical rule, is called the Si-Gwamba.\n\nB. The Tribe and the Land.\n\nSi-Gwamba is spoken by a large tribe; but it would scarcely be possible to estimate precisely its number. There may possibly be several hundred thousand Ma-Gwamba. Their native land is on the eastern coast of Africa, and extends from Zululand in the south up to Sofala, and perhaps to the Zambesi river, in the north. Inland, the Ma-Gwamba extend as far as three hundred miles from the Indian Ocean,\nso that the country which is occupied by the tribe is of a large area.\n\nAll the Ma-Gwamba who live north of the Limpopo river, that is to say, the greater part of the tribe, are under the domination of Umzila, that Zulu Chief who, some thirty years ago, left Zululand with a Zulu army, conquered the countries through which he passed, and settled at some distance west of Sofala.\n\nThe farthest inland region where Ma-Gwamba settlements are to be found is situated in a south-western direction from Umzila's kraal. Indeed, if we examine a recent map, for instance, that of Petermann's Mittheilungen (1872, table 21), or that of Jeppe, which for that matter is a copy of Petermann's, we find on the north of the Limpopo river, along the $31^\\circ$ long., up to the $21^\\circ$ lat. S., a country which has been explored only by the traveller Mauch. The names which we read there, along the routes followed by Mauch, are but those of Gwamba Chiefs. About five years ago I had a good opportunity of collecting some fresh information concerning those Gwamba settlements, when one of my Christian servants, a middle-aged Gwamba man, made a journey back and forth through that same country.\n\nThus, coming from the north, we first find Dumbo's kraal. The river Lunde passes close by, and the people of the kraal drink of its waters. This is close to the frontier, between Ma-Gwamba and Ba-Nyai, or between Umzila's and Lo-Bengula's kingdom. But the maps must be corrected and the frontier removed some twenty miles more to the west; for the first Ba-Nyai settlement, the kraal of Makadyile, is situated on the left bank of the river Lunde, about ten miles north-west of Dumbo.\n\nThe father of Dumbo was Ngwenya; they are Ma-Gwamba, under the rule of Umzila. But Dumbo, becoming dissatisfied with his suzerain, left the place and went to live with Lo-Bengula. He was not followed by many of his people; and the kraal is now governed by Dumbo's young brother, named Rangane, who is a loyal vassal of Umzila.\n\nIf we go southward, we find on the river Buby\u00e9 several\nGwamba names, from Vurmele downwards. But in this name the letter V has the German pronunciation, and therefore it ought to be altered and changed for an F. The exact orthography of the name is Furumele. However, this Gwamba Chief is no more, and future travellers will find another name at his place, because he was succeeded by his son Mokaha.\n\nTshukumeta is a Gwamba Chief.\n\nMakabele is also a Mo-Gwamba; but he has emigrated with his people, and gone to settle in a place south of the junction of the Bubye and Limpopo rivers, near the Gwamba settlement of Makuleka.\n\nZamokazi has also left, to go and settle south of the Limpopo, among the Zoutpansberg lower hills.\n\nHalata, Umkoko, Umkokinyane are all Gwamba people.\n\nMalingotse is only the name of the land.\n\nIf now we go S.E., and cross both the Limpopo and its affluent the Limvubu (called Lebvubybe by the Ma-Gwamba), we meet some hills, to which the maps give the name of Sierra de Chicundo. This somewhat strange name is quite right; but it needs to be explained. I dare say it was first written so by Rita Montanha, in whose language sierra is a range of hills; and geographers put down the full name after him. Then came the ordinary readers, who found the whole appellation of Sierra de Chicundo sounded very much like a Portuguese or a Spanish name; and accordingly they assumed that it really was a Portuguese name, given to the place by the Portuguese of the coast. But such is not the case. Chicundo is a proper Gwamba name, and it was, in this instance, that of a Chief of no mean importance. In the neighbourhood of Chicundo's Hills there are many other Gwamba settlements; but Chicundo himself died a few years ago. I do not know the name of his successor. But at present the most important chief of that country is Shikucarakwara, who lives on the left bank of the Limvubu river, at a little distance from the Motswetla chief, Makwarele.\n\nThe above details are no doubt sufficient to prove that the various portions of the Gwamba tribe are scattered over a\nvery extensive country. This country is limited on the south, east, and west, by frontiers which have been well ascertained. But the northern frontier remains to be exactly defined, as the country which extends from Sofala to the Zambesi has, till now, scarcely been explored at all.\n\nStrange to say, a small community of Ma-Gwamba is to be found under the 12\u00b0 Lat. S., to the west of and not far from Lake Nyassa. The missionaries of Livingstonia and Bandawe are in relation with those Ma-Gwamba, who live there mixed with Xosa and Zulu from the South.\n\nII. Classification.\n\nSeveral dialects are to be found in the Gwamba language, and their variations are sometimes very remarkable. But they are still mostly unknown. The books which we have begun printing are written in the dialect of Lorenzo-Marqu\u00e8s, and of the country south of the Limpopo.\n\nThe language to which Gwamba most closely relates is certainly Xosa, although the \"ukuhlonipa\" custom is not practised among the Ma-Gwamba. The Suto language differs much more from both Xosa and Gwamba, than those two from each other; and Dr. Bleek judged with accuracy when he stated (\u00a7 22) that \"The South-Eastern Branch consists of three distinct species: Kafir, Si-Chuana, and Tekeza.\" Only, he might have named Xosa between the two others, and put Tekeza the first, as being the natural link between the Middle Branch and Xosa; or again, if Zulu must be distinguished from Xosa, the list of the South-Eastern Branch should be: Gwamba, Zulu, Xosa, and Chuana.\n\nAmong Middle Branch languages, the idioms which approach nearest to Gwamba are those of Sena and Tete. But they are as yet too little known to allow of establishing the degree of their relationship with Gwamba. However, if it is not too bold to make a supposition, I should foretell, after what is known of those languages, that a closer study will bring them in very close relationship to Gwamba, closer\nthan Kua is to Sena, and perhaps than Xosa is to Gwamba. In that manner the Bantu languages will appear to form a regular chain of which it may be felt necessary to know all the links, before a full theory of their origin can be arrived at.\n\nThe theory of a \"mother-tongue\" seems to be actually deprecated, because of the numerous questions that it cannot answer. Thus Mr. Maples, writing on Kua, says: \"Ma-Kua possesses a large number of words entirely non-existent in any other of the known languages in Bantu. No known law of verbal change or transliteration can account for these words by showing them to be phonologically connected with others in other dialects of the same group. This fact . . . . refuses to yield to the theory of a mother-tongue.\" This is quite right; but when we consider that the Bantu dialects are still so imperfectly studied, we are obliged to defer drawing conclusions; for it is not impossible that a more complete acquaintance with the Bantu system may bring forth new and still unknown laws of verbal changes, which will rehabilitate \"the mother-tongue theory.\" We can already see that any other theory will have to overcome much greater difficulties than that one. Indeed, the mutual relationship of the Bantu languages is an undeniable fact, and of supreme importance; such a deep and intimate connexion between various languages demands an explanation, and the question must be asked imperiously: \"How have they come to be so much like each other?\" Therefore I fear that if any new theory is brought forward in opposition with the old hypothesis of a mother-tongue, the said theory will find insuperable the difficulty of answering that question.\n\nBut we are still far from any solution, because our knowledge of the Bantu dialects is far too incomplete to give occasion to make I shall not say a synthesis, which will only come at the end, but even a full and comprehensive analysis of the general system of the Bantu languages. Let us then, for the present, set aside all attempts at constructing a theory of that system, and let us direct our efforts to the analytical study of every particular idiom, in order to prepare the necessary materials for the future edifice.\nIII. Phonology.\n\nThe alphabet of the Gwamba language contains a very remarkable peculiarity, which well deserves to draw the attention of linguists. This peculiarity consists in a special consonant which has never been heard of before, and which must be classed as a labial sibilant. The sound of this letter is obtained by putting the tongue in the position required for the letter \\( s \\), and then by closing the lips, so that they cover the teeth, and so that the breath produces the friction against the lips only. It is as pure a labial as \\( p \\), \\( b \\), \\( m \\), and is as strong a sibilant as \\( s \\) or \\( sh \\) (English). At first, a stranger's ear will mistake it for a compound consonant, which it is not, for it may also combine with the letter \\( t \\) the same way as \\( s \\) does in the words \\( tsar \\), \\( tearina \\).\n\nWhen Dr. Peters collected his vocabularies of Lorenzo-Marqu\u00e8s and of Inhambane, he missed the true sound and misunderstood the real value of this letter. Dr. Bleek did of course the same, because he had no other source but Dr. Peters' vocabularies. This traveller took this sound for a combination of \\( p \\) and \\( s \\), and consequently he represented it by \\( ps \\).\n\nI may here make a general remark upon vocabularies collected by travellers and explorers. Dr. Peters was, I presume, perfectly prepared for the work he undertook, and his collections of words were made with great care and ability. In spite of that, his vocabulary of Lorenzo-Marqu\u00e8s is very defective, and it contains some gross errors. Thus he gives for the Gwamba word \\( tillo \\) the meaning of 'God,' which is a mistake: \\( tillo \\) means the sky, and the Gwamba word for 'God' is \\( Shikweombo \\) (or \\( Tshikweombo \\)). Again, for a 'blind man,' he gives this translation:\u2014\\( loa-koa-ngabo-ne \\): it is evident that here Dr. Peters thought this expression was perhaps made of four different words, which he attempted to separate with hyphens. But he was somewhat mistaken, and having not learned the Gwamba grammar, he mutilated the language in an awful manner; he divided words and made others with the separated syllables; or he joined in\none word different ones, which ought to have remained separate. In fact, the translation he gave for 'blind man' contains a whole sentence, which, if constructed according to grammatical rule, will read as follows: *lo a ko a nya bone*; and it means in English, 'the one who says he does not see.' Of course, the idea conveyed by that expression is not wrong; but nobody would think of giving to this English sentence the form and place of one word; and the said Gwamba phrase is not the Gwamba expression for 'blind man,' it is but an explanatory description.\n\nMany similar examples of errors could be produced out of Dr. Peters' vocabularies, and when we remember that this eminent traveller deserved more than usual credit, we must forcibly come to this conclusion: when explorers give vocabularies of unknown languages, such vocabularies must be received with caution and reserve, because a person who has not mastered the language, who cannot explain its grammatical forms, and who has not lived long enough among the natives to become fully acquainted with their manner of thinking, that person will often be misled and give a wrong translation.\n\nThat is the very reason why Dr. Peters used the combination *ps* to represent the labial sibilant which constitutes the most remarkable characteristic of the Gwamba alphabet.\n\nBut then, what letter, what sign shall we take to express graphically this newly-discovered consonant? When seeking for a system of writing to be applied to Gwamba, we found the Standard Alphabet of Professor Lepsius the best system, and adopted it. But though very rich, it contained of course no representation of our new sound, which has not been heard of before. However, as this sound's basis is a sibilant fricativa fortis, the principle of the Standard Alphabet led us to take the basis *s* and try to invent for it a practical diacritical sign; then noticing that the English *sh* was represented by *\u0161*, it was decided to invert the diacritical mark of this and write *\u0161* for our labial sibilant.\n\nNow the question may be asked: this letter, has it a great importance in the language? or also, as the honourable Pro-\nfessor Dr. Lepsius wrote to me: this sound, is it not produced by an anomalous pronunciation of the s? It is an easy matter to answer those questions, and to prove that this is a real characteristic sound and of essential importance. We have but to quote from Dr. Bleek's Comparative Grammar a sentence of paragraph 471, which says: \"The following table showing the correspondence of the derivative prefixes of nouns in the Northern Tekeza dialect spoken at Lorenzo-Marqu\u00e8s, Delagoa Bay, is of course incomplete. It is supposed that the form of the eighth prefix here is psi, as in the dialect of Tette, but the vocabularies (as yet our only materials for the knowledge of these dialects) contain no positive evidence of this.\"\n\nRemembering then that the psi of Bleek and Peters finds its true representation in our \u0161i and t\u0161i, I can assert that it is really the form of the eighth prefix in the Gwamba language. Before I could myself procure and read a copy of Bleek's Comparative Grammar (which I was recently able to do through Mr. R. N. Cust's obliging kindness), I had pointed out that special form of prefix, both when corresponding with Professor Lepsius and when teaching Gwamba grammar to our missionary students. Therefore this letter (\u0161) is the only means of distinguishing a whole class of nouns, and it has for itself a whole and independent set of concord. It is also a mark of the plural, as will be seen by looking at Bleek's tables of prefixes; and in Gwamba this is a rule without any exception: wherever that prefix is heard or seen, the word which owns it is plural.\n\nMoreover, this letter is largely used in the language, not only because it occurs in the middle of words, as well as in the prefix, but because the pronoun, which corresponds to the nouns of that class, is commonly used by itself in a general and neutral sense. This pronoun can then be exactly translated by the French word 'cela,' which the English word 'that' renders but insufficiently.\n\nTherefore it is evident that this new letter is of the greatest importance; and the readers of Bleek's Comparative Grammar will notice that the alphabets of Sena and of\nTette also possess the same letter, which permits us to think that those dialects are closely related to Gwamba (see Bleek, \u00a7 471).\n\nA very strange feature of the Gwamba language is that, unlike its sister-tongues, it has two nasalized vowels (see Lepsius' Standard Alphabet, pp. 58, 59). In Indian languages it appears that this nasalization is occasionally applied to all vowels; whilst I think that among European languages French alone possesses nasalized vowels. But Gwamba has only two, the sounds of which we find in the French words ban and pain, and which Lepsius writes \u0101 and \u0113. However, those nasalized vowels are not found in a great many words.\n\nAmong the twenty-eight letters of the alphabet, the most frequently met with in the speech is certainly the vowel a: it appears in an average of 20 per cent. If we add to this that the proportion of the letter e, with its various shades, comes to 12 per cent., and of o to 8 per cent., the remaining vowels making together about 10 per cent., it will undoubtedly appear that the consonants take but one-half of the room in the speech, and that the language must sound soft and harmonious. This opinion will be strengthened by the consideration that there is no harsh guttural in Gwamba, the letters k, g, and h having not a hard pronunciation.\n\nEuphony is indeed a very important element in the formation and derivation of Gwamba words. The same remark is of course applicable to the other Bantu idioms; but they do not follow the same phonetic principles. On the contrary, each particular language has special phonetic principles, which are its private property, and which can well serve as a distinguishing characteristic. This fact is so important that Bleek ought to have had a chapter on euphony in Part I. of his book, where he treats the subject of Phonology. Certainly it is very strange that Bleek, in his Comparative Grammar of Bantu Languages, did not write a word on euphonic principles and rules. Was it, perhaps, because he could not ascertain surely enough what these principles were in each language, on account of the scantiness of his sources of information? True\nit is, at any rate, that one must be thoroughly well acquainted with a language to understand perfectly the principle of its euphony; and it has such a great importance that the grammarian must always be on the watch not to miss it. However, there can be no difficulty in finding examples where the application of euphonic rule is to be detected. Thus, it is the case with foreign words, when they are introduced into a language: two sister-tongues will not always give the same form to the same word, and generally Gwamba does not alter a foreign word as much as Suto does.\n\nBut let us take a few examples to show the way those idioms adapt to themselves a European word. The word 'book' has passed into several of the South African languages. Both Gwamba and Suto have retained the English sound, and have only added a termination, made of a vowel; but Gwamba has chosen the vowel u to make it harmonize with the first syllable, whilst Suto chose a in order to lighten the word, for in Suto the vowel u would in that word have too much weight. We have therefore buku in Gwamba, and buka in Suto.\n\nAgain, the Dutch word for to work is werk, from which Ma-Gwamba have made berenga and Ba-Suto bereka. This is in accordance with a remark made by Bleek, that in Gwamba (Tekeza) and in Xosa the tendency to nasalization is stronger than in Chuana. However, we cannot make of it a permanent rule, for even that nasalization of words is oftentimes affected by euphony; and after a careful examination one might possibly be led to say that the Chuana system of nasalization is the contrary of the Gwamba system. If we take, for instance, the English word 'paper,' we find that Ma-Gwamba have made of it papelo, without any nasal sound, whilst Ba-Suto have made it pampiri, and thus introduced a nasal consonant into it.\n\nStill there are many foreign words which have taken the same shape in both languages, an example of which is found in the word teke, which in Gwamba and Suto means 'a week.'\n\nMr. Maples will have to prove the accuracy of his statement,\nwhen he said in his \"Notes on Ma-Kua,\" \"The English o (as in 'go') is unknown in Ma-Kua and in South African languages generally, the o of the vocabularies usually standing for the English oa in such a word as 'soar,' or the a in 'water,' 'call,' etc.\" I beg leave to say that the sound of o as in 'go' is not unknown, but it is less common than the other shades of o. We find it in the Gwamba word lo, which is of frequent usage, in the word ngoppo, etc. It also occurs in the Suto word bobo 'evil,' lona 'you,' etc.\n\nMany ways of combining consonants are to be found in Gwamba. But we must notice two remarkable peculiarities which occur in the union of certain consonants with certain vowels, or rather double-vowels. Let us take first the case of m, as illustrated by the first class prefix of nouns. This prefix is mo, and if it is applied to a radical which begins with the vowel a, it should seemingly give mo-a . . . , etc. But the \"g\u00e9nie de la langue\" does not allow of such a form, on account of euphony; and consequently the vowel o changes into the semivowel u, and the initial consonant m becomes a guttural n, which Lepsius represents by \u014b, and which also belongs to English, as in the word 'singing.'\n\nTherefore instead of mo-a the Gwamba says \u014buca; for instance, 'a child' is in Gwamba \u014bucana, which stands for mo-ana.\n\nBut it is not only with the prefix mo, neither only with the vowel a, that this rule finds an application. The meeting of the vowel e will produce the same effect, of which an example can be taken from the locative case of certain nouns.\n\nThe locative is formed by adding n or en at the end of the noun; the word mathamo might in the locative have become mathamo-en, instead of which it becomes mathanwen. In the same manner the locative of nsimo will be nsinwen, and so on with all substantives which terminate in mo.\n\nThe second consonant to be mentioned is b, which has an analogous peculiarity. This letter cannot in Gwamba precede two vowels of which the first had the sound of o or of u; it cannot precede sounds represented by the joined vowels oa,\nua, oe, ue, etc. We can take an illustration of this from a class of nouns whose prefix is bo or bu. Thus the Gwamba word for a 'boat' comes from the radical at and takes the prefix bo; consequently it might have had the form of bo-at-o. But the 'g\u00e9nie de la langue' and its euphonic principle cannot accept such a sound as bo-a; and will not even allow the vowel o to be replaced by its corresponding semivowel w, as was the case with the prefix mo. Here, instead of the o, the Gwamba will have the semivowel y, and the b undergoes no change, so that the bo-a becomes bya; and the word for a 'boat' will be byato. In the same manner, the word for 'beer' is byalwa instead of bu-alwa.\n\nAgain, the same rule applies to the locative case of the nouns which terminate with bo or bu, whatever may be their respective prefixes. Thus the word hubo will not make its locative in hubuen, but in hubyen. Nkhubu will give nkhubyen; mekhubu, mekhubyen, and so on.\n\nIV. MORPHOLOGY.\n\nBefore giving here the table of the Gwamba classes of prefixes, it will be necessary to speak briefly of a word or letter whose character Dr. Bleek could not define. Quoting from his Comparative Grammar, we read in the paragraph 471 about \"Tekeza\" the following: \"An initial vowel (frequently a), which is evidently unconnected with the prefix, occasionally precedes the noun in these vocabularies. The nature of this vowel is not clear. When an a, it may be merely the genitive particle.\n\nWe gather from this: 1. That Bleek has noticed that in Gwamba a vowel may precede the noun; 2. That this vowel may be either a or another vowel; 3. That this initial vowel is but occasional; 4. That it is unconnected with the prefix.\n\nI am glad to be able to confirm Bleek's observations on this point, and I think I can explain the nature of this vowel.\nAs to the last sentence of the quotation, Dr. Bleek's vocabularies are not at present at my disposal, so that I cannot point out the words in which the said initial vowel may be merely \"the genitive particle.\" But it is no matter of importance.\n\nNow to the four observations which Bleek made upon the initial vowel, we must add a few more, which will lead us to understand its nature.\n\n1. This vowel always precedes a word beginning with a consonant.\n\n2. It may precede, not only nouns, though this case is the most frequent, but also other words, as, for instance, the preposition ka, the adverb h\u0101ni, etc.\n\n3. When a noun depends on a preposition, and a preposition always precedes its regimen, the initial vowel will not find room between the preposition and the noun.\n\n4. This last rule is capable of a general extension, for the initial vowel will not precede a word which is so closely connected with a preceding word as to make with it a grammatical member of a sentence.\n\n5. The vowel varies according to the phonetic character of the word it precedes.\n\n6. It is usually found to precede the most important member of a sentence, or any important member, especially so when this member opens the sentence.\n\nFrom these various observations it will appear that this initial vowel is an epenthetic letter, to the occurrence of which a double cause must be ascribed, namely: euphony and emphasis. Wherefore it has a double function: 1. When Ma-Gwamba pronounce a word of importance in their speech, they like to open the mouth with a vowel, especially after a pause; and they want this vowel the most when the first syllable of the word bears the accent. Euphony is then the ruling principle in such a case. 2. If in his speech a Mo-Gwamba wants to emphatically mark a noun or another word, he will as a manner of announcement put this initial vowel before it; but he must use the initial vowel which euphony would require. This second function is not\ntherefore opposite to the first; but very often they are united.\n\nIt strikes me that this Gwamba vowel is perhaps identical with the vowel which often precedes nouns in Xosa and Zulu, and which has also attracted the attention of Dr. Bleek. But I dare not insist upon comparing them, because Dr. Bleek assigns quite another r\u00f4le to the Kafir initial vowel. In paragraphs 461 and sequent he calls it \"article\" and he says (464): \"Although it is clear that the initial vowel was originally a pronoun (derived from, and at first identical with, the derivative prefix which it precedes), and used with the force of an article, it can hardly be said now to have this power. Its employment appears mainly to depend upon usage, and scarcely upon any intention of thereby defining the noun. The position of this ancient article at the beginning of the noun accords with the general position of the demonstrative pronouns in Kafir, which in this language, as well as in Isubu, precede the noun, instead of being placed after it, as in Setshuana and most of the Bantu languages. Vestiges of this old article are also found in some other Bantu languages (as in Mpongwe).\"\n\nAfter this quotation I feel justified in considering this initial vowel in Xosa as similar and parallel to the Gwamba one. But I regret to say I cannot endorse Dr. Bleek's opinions upon it. First, it was in vain that I sought in his Comparative Grammar for the ground upon which he states \"that it is clear the initial vowel was originally a pronoun, and used with the force of an article.\" He gives no proof of this, and therefore the words \"it is clear\" must be taken only as the expression of a subjective opinion. Now, the end of the sentence, and the sentence following it, contain other statements which contradict his opinion; for he says that the initial vowel has not now the power of an article, that its employment depends upon usage, and that its function is not to define the nouns. Here, I quite concur in these three remarks: and I can only wish that linguists may study more closely the question of this initial vowel.\n\nIn fact the Bantu languages have no article, and their\npeculiar genius admits of none. Often and often have I examined this subject, and I cannot conceive where room could be found to introduce a word which should be called an \"article,\" whether definite or indefinite. Indeed, what is an \"article\"? In all languages, European or otherwise, which possess articles, we find that these are little words of a special kind which entertain intimate and peculiar relations with substantive nouns. But these relations are very precise and constant, and they may be said to take three forms or to follow three manners: 1. The substantive may be without any article, and is then taken in general, with its full extension. 2. The substantive may be preceded by the indefinite article, which then particularizes the notion of the noun; but it does not precise it. 3. The substantive may be preceded by the definite article, which particularizes and also precises the notion expressed, and draws the attention upon a definite individual or object.\n\nThere are thus three notions which, by means of the articles, we can apply to the substantive. But these functions of the articles are only formal, and they do not affect in any way the essential idea of the noun.\n\nNow, the Bantu languages possess no special word to exercise this power; and if they want to precise and to define a notion, in order to refer to a single individual and to distinguish it from similar ones, those languages must have recourse to demonstratives, to adjectives, or to some other way of qualifying the noun.\n\nBut certainly this is not done by using the initial vowel which we speak of. The initial vowel is used for euphony and for emphasis, be they either joined together or separate. Had Dr. Bleek written a chapter on the phonetic euphony of the Bantu languages, he would probably have detected the nature of this vowel in \"Gwamba\" (Tekeza).\n\nIt will now be necessary to complete Bleek's table of the Gwamba prefixes, which are given on page 62.\n### Personal Pronouns\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| **1.**   |        |\n| *mo-, mu-*  \n| *n- (mo-l-)*  \n| *nw- (mo-a-)* | *ba-* |\n| **3.**   |        |\n| *mo-, mu-*  \n| *n- (mo-l-)*  \n| *n-*  \n| *m-* | *me-*  \n| *me-l-*  \n| *me-* |\n| **5.**   |        |\n| *ri-, re-*  \n| (\u2014\u2014) | *ma-* |\n| **7.**   |        |\n| *t\u0161i-, \u0161i-*  \n| *t\u0161e-, \u0161e-* | *t\u0161i-, \u0161i-*  \n| *t\u0161e-, \u0161e-* |\n| **9.**   |        |\n| *in-, en-*  \n| *im-, em*  \n| (\u2014\u2014) | *tin-*  \n| *tim-*  \n| *ti-* |\n| **5 (11).** |        |\n| *ri-, re-*  \n| *rim-*  \n| *ren-* | *ti-*  \n| *tim-*  \n| *tin-* |\n| **14 (Abstract).** |        |\n| *bo-, bu-*  \n| *by-u- (bo-a-)* | *ma-* |\n| **15. (Infinitive).** |        |\n| *ko-*  \n| *ku-* |\nAbout these prefixes, Dr. Bleek says (\u00a7 471): \"The contraction of the form \\( mu-l \\) to \\( n \\) in the 1st and 3rd classes is the chief characteristic of the Tekeza species.\" This remark is true enough, but Dr. Bleek only possessed a very incomplete table of the Gwamba prefixes, as he himself tells us in the same paragraph. If he had seen a true list of them as they stand in our present table, surely he would have found in it a rich ground for investigation. He would, for instance, have considered as very peculiar and interesting the form of the 8th class, where a newly-discovered consonant forms a prominent feature. Again, his attention would have rested on the 3rd class, where the prefix \\( n \\) is not only a contraction of \\( mu-l \\), but also a contraction of \\( mo \\) before the consonants \\( t, k \\), etc., when the accent does not fall upon the prefix; and also on the 1st class, where \\( mo-a \\) contracts into \\( nu-a \\); again, on the 14th class, where \\( bo-a \\) contracts into \\( by-a \\), etc.\n\nIt is greatly to be regretted that Dr. Bleek was not able to complete his work and to write on the Bantu system of verbs. I have not yet seen this system fully explained in any book, in any grammar. True it is that it is so peculiar, so very different from what we are accustomed to find in European languages, that I am afraid it will be necessary to overthrow half of our traditional notions on grammatical exposition if we are determined to do justice to the conjugation of Bantu verbs. And first of all, a conjugation, what is it? What does that name mean? In a general sense, it means a complete and systematic collection of the forms a verb is capable of taking. Then in Gwamba there is but one such collection, because all the verbs follow the same kind of development. Therefore, in opposition to what we find in Greek, Latin, etc., we can say that in Gwamba, and generally in the Bantu languages, there is only one conjugation.\n\nBut this name of \"conjugation\" is often used in a more restricted sense by grammarians, so that in many grammars we are taught that the same verb is capable of following several conjugations, be they affirmative, negative, or otherwise.\nSome authors even call by that name every set of moods and tenses which a verb may go through. But, if we were to do the same in Gwamba, it would be an easy matter to show that this language possesses some eighty or hundred conjugations. To take such a course would be somewhat improper, and it will be better to seek for more proper appellations.\n\nWe are accustomed to divide a conjugation in several \"voices.\" But here again it is noticeable that grammarians do not agree on the meaning of this word, and that they follow no logical rule in applying it. Their disaccord leads to confusion, and comes from the fact that they have not properly stated what must be meant by a \"voice.\" If we want to avoid that confusion, and to get a clear idea of the Gwamba, and indeed of the Bantu system of verbs, we must give a precise definition of the word.\n\nAs a rule, two or three sets of moods and tenses are ranged under that heading of \"voices\"; they are the active, passive and reflective. This classification may be good for Indo-European languages; but authors have introduced it into the grammar of other families of idioms, without first examining whether it was really applicable. Were they justified in doing so? Have they not too easily yielded to habit and prejudice?\n\nIf the characteristic of a \"voice\" is only to mark the distinction of the meaning of the active and of the passive, then they are right; and consequently we should acknowledge that there are in Gwamba some twenty or thirty 'voices,' namely, the active, passive, reflective, causative, relative, reciprocal, frequentative, qualificative, etc. All of them are grammatically of the same formation; all of them are parallel modifications of the active primitive. To take an example, the word Ko laba means 'to seek': the passive is obtained by adding to the radical a syllable (suffix) composed of i and u, which gives labuca 'be sought.' Similarly, the causative is obtained by adding i and s to the radical, which gives labisa 'cause to seek.' Again, the reciprocal is formed by adding a n to the radical, which gives labana 'seek each\nother.' And so on, all the senses which differ from the primitive active are obtained in a similar way, and the new radicals formed in this manner follow exactly the same conjugation, or conjugations, as the active simple does. The formative process is the same either for the passive, the causative, or any other; and therefore they must be classed under the same heading. If then the passive is to be called a \"voice,\" the causative must be also, as well as the reciprocal, the reflective, and also the combinations of them, for these forms often combine. But to have twenty, or more, voices, either simple or combined, would be rather puzzling.\n\nSome authors have used another name and have called derivative verbs the causative, reciprocal, and a few more; but they retained the name of \"voices\" to apply it to the passive and active only. But in so doing they have created an arbitrary division between the latter class and the former, a division which does not exist in the Bantu grammar, and which has no ground to stand upon. In Latin and Greek the passive does not conjugate the same way as the active, so that there is an active and a passive manner of conjugation. Not so, however, in Gwamba, where active and passive conjugate exactly the same way, as well as the reciprocal, causative, etc. All these forms of the verb only differ by a small alteration of the radical; this alteration is different in each case, but its power and its value are always equivalent, consisting in the addition of a syllable of two letters only.\n\nBut then what shall we do? How shall we class those various forms of the Gwamba verb? If we are determined to acknowledge the grammar as it is, and not to mutilate it, it seems we must say that in Gwamba any passive is but a derivative verb, and that, beside it, there are several kinds of derivative verbs, such as the reflective, the causative, etc., which are formed by adding affixes to the radical. These affixes are ten in number. As they may be used either singly or in combination, some of the derivative verbs must be called simple, because they are formed by the addition of only one\naffix; and some must be called combined, because they combine in them two or more formative affixes. If, for instance, we take the examples quoted above, we shall note that from the primitive laba 'seek,' the simple derivative labuca 'be sought,' is obtained, as also labisa 'cause to seek,' and labana 'seek each other.' If then we combine them by two, we get labisiwa, of which it will be hard to give a right English translation, the meaning coming to this, 'they cause me to be sought'; and another combined derivative will be labisana, which means 'they cause each other to be sought.' An example of the combination of three suffixes in one derivative is found in the word lahekeriwa, which means that the subject has 'lost something per accident.' This verb is a passive; but the formative suffix of the passive has been applied the last, that is, after the two other, because the sense to be obtained wanted it so.\n\nMany other combinations may take place, and according to the sense of the root give new derivative verbs, in which the respective position of each affix may vary greatly; for it would be erroneous to think that the formative suffix of the passive is always found to occupy the same place. There is but one affix, which, when used, always occupies the same position, it is the formative prefix of the reflective; and this is due to the fact that it is the only \"prefix\" among all those formative affixes.\n\nIn opposition to all the derivatives, the verb, when taken as it appears in its simplest form, should be called the primitive. Still, one must bear in mind that both primitive and derivative conjugate exactly the same way.\n\nTheir conjugation consists of four different and full sets of moods and tenses. These four sets might be called either \"voices\" or \"conjugations,\" the latter word being of course taken in a restricted sense. As our European languages possess no other expressions, we must choose between those two.\n\nIt seems desirable a priori to apply the more special term to the simpler division, and to reserve the more general name for the whole. Therefore we shall call \"voices\" the said\nfour sets of moods and tenses. We can do it the more rightly, since it has been shown that the passive is a derivative and not a voice, so that no confusion will ensue. Accordingly we can say that the Gwamba conjugation divides into four voices, as follows:\n\n1. The first one expresses a simple affirmation of the action, and consequently it may be called the simple affirmative voice.\n\n2. The second is used to express the action, but only in the relative sentences, and never in the principal proposition; wherefore it must be named the affirmative relative voice.\n\n3. The third is always constructed with a negative adverb, and gives a simple negative statement of a fact, so that it may be called the simple negative voice.\n\n4. The fourth one has also a negative construction and a negative sense; but its form can only be used in subordinate propositions which begin with a relative pronoun. We therefore shall call it the negative relative voice.\n\nThose four voices are not equally rich in forms, because their respective nature cannot allow them always to follow the same development. Thus, the first and third have all the moods and tenses; whilst the second and fourth can evidently have no imperative mood, for an order cannot be given in a subordinate sentence. But apart from such natural deficiencies, all four voices are well provided with the necessary forms; not only that, but very often they have two, even three forms, where European languages have but one, and where indeed one would suffice. A speaker, when choosing among those various forms, will often be guided by mere euphony.\n\nIt happens, however, that the fourth voice, the negative relative, offers more complicated forms than the three others; and, as the genius of the Bantu languages is prone to simplify the speech as much as possible, the result is that this fourth voice is often avoided, and that the sentence takes another turn.\n\nMany authors have written on the grammar of Bantu\nlanguages; but, till now, we have not been able to find in their books even the mention of these four voices of the Bantu verb. Shall we conclude from this that Gwamba is among all the Bantu idioms the only one to possess them? Such a conclusion would not only be very hasty, but also quite wrong; for, indeed, the four voices are actually existing in the other Bantu idioms, as a closer study of them will surely show. It seems as if the authors, when wishing to unveil to European scholars the structure of those peculiar idioms, had thought it necessary to cast the Bantu grammar in the mould of European languages, but that, in forcing it in, they nipped off those strange features which European languages had nothing to correspond to. It appears to me that the position of the Bantu languages is still far from being fully understood, and that several of their most interesting and most important features have been overlooked and missed. Let scholars make a thorough investigation of the whole matter, with an unprejudiced spirit, and they can be certain they will be richly repaid for their labour.\n\nBut to come back to our four voices. I can certify that Suto, which I have been using for the last ten years, has them also; and it would be easy to lay down their conjugations. Moreover, when perusing the books relating to other Bantu languages, I easily detected in them the forms of the four voices, as they stand respectively in every language described by the authors.\n\nThus, in his Kafir Grammar, Davis gives a complete paradigm of the verb; he gives the affirmative and negative forms of the tenses. But he never speaks of the relative forms, though they accidentally appear, or a few of them at least, here and there, in the sentences he quotes as examples for special rules.\n\nGrout, in his Zulu Grammar, also gives the affirmative and negative verbs, but no relative voices. However, he could not help noticing the most evident forms of the latter, as they repeatedly appear in the paragraphs where he speaks of the \"relative pronouns.\" Let us especially mention\n\u00a7 163, e, and \u00a7 173, 1 and 2. In the examples given there, it will be seen that the verbs at the relative affirmative voice terminate in *yo* and *ko* (according to tenses). But the author tries an explanation of this termination, and says it is \u201ca pronominal euphonic suffix.\u201d This explanation is, however, insufficient.\n\nIf now, leaving the south, we want an example of how the matter stands in the most northern idiom, we can take Steere\u2019s *Handbook of Swahili*, and his *Swahili Exercises*. The author gives much explanation upon the conjugation, but he does not speak of the relative voices. We, however, find some bits of them scattered here and there, for instance, pages 127 and 135 of the *Handbook*, and pages 35 to 37 of the *Exercises*. The author did not miss the change which the verb underwent; but instead of searching the whole conjugation, he only gave the name of \u201crelative sign\u201d to the new syllable introduced.\n\nThis discussion would take us too far, if we were to go into more details, and therefore we must leave it now. However, it will be proper, I dare say, to give a sort of justification of our opinion, and to prove that it is rightly grounded. The best way to do that is to take an example of the simple affirmative and affirmative relative voices, and also of the corresponding English conjugation, and then institute a comparison, which, if laid out in a table, will at a glance tell the value of the relative forms of the Gwamba verbs.\n\nLet us take the verb *ndi laba* \u2018I want,\u2019 and write the first person of every tense in the *affirmative simple* and in the *affirmative relative* voices, with the English meaning. In the table we shall suppose that the full sentences are \u2018I want the knife\u2019 *ndi laba mokwana*, and \u2018the knife which I want\u2019 *mokwana louo ndi labaka*; but for the sake of clearness we will only write the subject and the verb.\n\nThis table shows that, in spite of the deficiencies inherent to a conjugation, which can only be used in relative sentences, still this *affirmative relative voice* owns a sufficient set of moods and tenses to allow of our calling it a \u201cvoice\u201d; or if the term \u201cvoice\u201d is thought objectionable, then there\nremains only the other one, that of \"conjugation,\" the use of which is in no way more exempt from inconveniences.\n\n| Simple Affirmative Voice | English                  | Affirmative Relative Voice |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|\n| nda laba                 | I am wanting             | ndi labaka                 |\n| ndi laba                 | I want                   | ngi ndi laba               |\n| a ndi laba               | I was wanting            | ndi labeke                 |\n| ndi labe                 | I wanted                 | ndi nga laba               |\n| ndi labile               | I have wanted            | ndi labileko               |\n| a ndi labe               | I had wanted             | ngi ndi labeke             |\n| ndi ta labe              | I shall want             | ngi ndi labileko           |\n| a ndi ta labe            | I shall have wanted      | ndi nga ta laba            |\n| ndi nga ba ndi labe      | I should want            | ndi nga ba ndi laba        |\n| ndi nga laba             | I can (or may) want      | ndi nga labaka             |\n\nIn the above table we have given only the first person of the singular of each tense; and it is sufficient, for a similar occurrence is observable in the Bantu conjugation as in the English one, namely, that in any tense the form of the verb remains unchanged for all the persons. Thus the English says:\n\n- I had wanted\n- he had wanted\n- she had wanted\n- it had wanted\n\nwe had wanted\nyou had wanted\nthey had wanted\n\nThe pronouns make all the difference. Exactly the same thing happens in Gwamba and all Bantu languages.\n\nAnother similarity between English and Gwamba is noticeable in the examples given above. The sentences 'I want the knife,' and 'the knife which I want,' have indeed an identical construction in both languages. But the English has an article, whilst Gwamba has none, as formerly explained.\n\nWe find that in Gwamba there is but one conjugation, which every verb must follow. But that conjuga-\ntion exhibits two sorts of development: 1. The primitive verb gives rise, by means of radical affixes, to a vast series of derivatives, among which the passive must be classed. 2. Both primitive and derivative conjugate in four voices, of which European languages have no example.\n\nIt may be the right place here to make a summary remark upon the now generally adopted way of writing Bantu verbs and sentences. Most English authors incorporate in one word the verb, its auxiliary, its pronoun subject, and, if there is one, its objective pronoun. Grout, however, did not do so; and, as a rule, French and German authors do not do it either. We think the latter are right, and we could prove it; but a discussion on the matter would be here out of place. We can only say that if this system of orthography were adopted in English, we would, instead of a sentence like 'he had not told it you,' have the big word *hehadnottoldityou*. There is no more reason to apply it to Bantu than to European languages.\n\nA remarkable feature of the Gwamba verb is that the active is often used instead of the passive, if there is no possibility of amphibology.\n\nV. Sematology.\n\nAll the Bantu people have been led by nature to use the decimal system in arithmetic, for when they are counting, they always reckon the numbers with their fingers. But, whilst some tribes have special nouns for the first ten numbers, in others the numerals only reach as far as five, and then there is a distinct word for ten. The latter is the case with Gwamba. After five they count 'five and one,' 'five and two,' etc.; and, again, after ten, they begin with 'ten and one.' For sixteen they accordingly say 'ten and five and one.' However, there is in Gwamba also a distinct word for 'hundred,' so that, in all, the nouns for numerals are seven in number, whilst in English we find about thirty of them.\n\nThe ordinal numbers are nearly the same as the common\nones, but *the first* is quite different. In order to say \u2018the first,\u2019 a verb is employed which means \u2018to be in front of,\u2019 and it is used as a substantive ruled by the genitive preposition \u2018of.\u2019 The same thing occurs probably in all the Bantu languages.\n\nThree different words are used for the verb \u2018to be,\u2019 namely, *ba*, *re* (or *le*), and *nga* (or *nge*, *ngi*). None of them has a complete conjugation; but they supply the deficiencies of each other. However, in simple sentences, when \u2018to be\u2019 is only the copula, it is allowed to drop, as in Latin.\n\nThe verb \u2018to have\u2019 is expressed by the copula followed by the preposition *na* \u2018with.\u2019 But as we have just said that the copula is commonly suppressed, there remains only the preposition *na*.\n\nThe negative adverbs are three in number. One is used absolutely to say \u2018no,\u2019 and the other two always accompany the verb. None of them can be joined with a substantive, and in order to say, for instance, \u2018no horse,\u2019 \u2018not a penny,\u2019 a short and impersonal phrase is generally used. This phrase means \u2018there is no . . .\u2019 or \u2018there was no . . .,\u2019 and on account of its frequent occurrence, it is sometimes taken with the power of an adjective.\n\nIt is scarcely possible to obtain from Gwamba people the names of the months, for they do not mind them. When any date is to be determined, they take their various agricultural labours as time marks, and they reckon the beginning of the year to be marked by the first gardening work of the season, which usually takes place in August or September.\n\nCuriously enough, they are somewhat more particular about the division of the day. They have distinct words or phrases to express \u2018daybreak,\u2019 \u2018sunrise,\u2019 \u2018morning,\u2019 \u2018middle morning,\u2019 \u2018midday,\u2019 etc., to \u2018night\u2019 and \u2018midnight.\u2019\n\nGwamba possesses a good number of abstract nouns, and when such a noun is wanting, it can be supplied by means of a verb, the infinitive of which is then used as a substantive. But, as might be expected, the actual abstract words express more often sentiments, passions, and moral dispositions, than intellectual abstractions.\nMimical gesture and intonation often accompany the speech. Thus, when an object is pointed to at some distance, the pitch of the voice is raised in proportion with the distance, and if the objects stand very far, the voice will attain the highest pitch. But, it must be borne in mind, that this is not characteristic of South African languages, for the same thing is done in Europe, either in a familiar and playful way, or by uneducated persons.\n\nThe Hottentot clicks which have crept into Suto, Xosa, and Zulu, are not known to the Gwamba language. However, the young men who learn Zulu affect sometimes to use clicks, by mere pride, to show that they know some words of foreign origin.\nART.

J.R.A.S.]\nsome exceptions. All trees, plants, and grains are feminine, with one or two exceptions; and fruits are masculine, except gaing 'a grape,' which is feminine. All liquids are feminine.\n\nThe relations of substantives are expressed by the application of postpositions, which are alike both in the singular and plural.\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| Nom. a man | siss. | men | siss. |\n| Gen. of a man | siss-\u00e9. | of men | siss-\u00e9. |\n| Dat. to a man | siss-er. | to men | siss-er. |\n| Acc. a man | siss. | men | siss. |\n| Abl. on a man | siss-ett\u00e9. | on men | siss-ett\u00e9. |\n| in a man | siss-\u00e9-\u00faloo. | in men | siss-\u00e9-\u00faloo. |\n| with a man | siss-\u00e9-k\u00e1t. | with men | siss-\u00e9-k\u00e1t. |\n| for a man | siss-\u00e9-gunn\u00e9. | for men | siss-\u00e9-gunn\u00e9. |\n| by or from a man | siss-t\u00e9um. | by or from men | siss-t\u00e9um. |\n| Voc. oh man | leh siss. | oh men | leh siss. |\n\nThe \u00e9 interposed between the noun and postposition in the ablative is only for the sake of euphony, and is often omitted. All nouns, both masculine and feminine, are declined like Siss, except feminine nouns relating to human beings, as:\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| Nom. (thy) wife | g\u00fas. | (thy) wives | g\u00fas-hiunta. |\n| Gen. of (thy) wife | g\u00fas-moh. | of (thy) wives | g\u00fas-hiunta-\u00e9. |\n| Dat. to (thy) wife | g\u00fas-mor. | to (thy) wives | g\u00fas-hiunta-er. |\n| Acc. (thy) wife | g\u00fas. | (thy) wives | g\u00fas-hiunta. |\n| Abl. on (thy) wife | g\u00fas-moy-ett\u00e9. | on (thy) wives | g\u00fas-hiunta-ett\u00e9. |\n| in (thy) wife | g\u00fas-mo-loo. | in (thy) wives | g\u00fas-hiunta-molo. |\n| with (thy) wife | g\u00fas-mo-k\u00e1t. | with (thy) wives | g\u00fas-hiunta-k\u00e1t. |\n| for (thy) wife | g\u00fas-mo-gunn\u00e9. | for (thy) wives | g\u00fas-hiunta-gunn\u00e9. |\n| by or from (thy) wife | g\u00fas-mo-teum. | by or from (thy) wives | g\u00fas-hiunta-teum. |\n| Voc. oh wife | wah g\u00fas. | oh wives | wah g\u00fas-hiunta. |\n\nThe vocative exclamation differs according to the relationship between the persons. Men say leh to one another, and w\u00e1h to all women except their own wives. To their wives they use the exclamation seh, which is also used by women to one another.\n\nThe noun in the genitive is placed before the governing noun, as: Siss\u00e9 h\u00e1ghoor 'The man's horse,' Siss\u00e9 tom\u00e1k\u00e9 didoo 'The man's gun's bullet.'\n\nEvery substantive and adjective has a suffixed termination both in the singular and plural, which is used somewhat as an indefinite or definite article, and is interposed between the substantive and the postposition. This termination is\nalways un or uun in the singular, but varies considerably in the plural, the commonest forms being ing, iho, \u00fbts, ik, and unts. It is not necessarily discarded when used with a numeral, as: Oom\u00e9 b\u00e9rum\u00e1n siss-ik yots\u00fbm\u00e2 \u2018How many men did you see?\u2019 Jah hin siss-un yetsum \u2018I saw one man.\u2019 Jeh siss-un-k\u00e2t niyum \u2018I went with the man.\u2019 But it would be more correct to say: Oom\u00e9 b\u00e9rum\u00e1n siss yots\u00fbm\u00e2? Jah hin siss yetsum. Jeh siss-k\u00e2t niyum.\n\nThe termination is never used in the singular with both adjective and substantive, but is suffixed to whichever comes last in the sentence, as:\n\nA strong man Shatillo siss-un.\nThat man is very strong In\u00e9 siss b\u00fat shatillo-wun bai.\n\nThis rule, however, does not always hold good in the plural, where the termination can be used at pleasure, either with both substantive and adjective, or only with one; but it is more correct to use it only as in the singular, for instance:\n\nStrong men Shatillo siss-ik.\nThose men are very strong Oo\u00e9 siss-ik b\u00fat shatill-joko b\u00e2n.\nTen swift horses T\u00f4romo h\u00fbmak\u00fbm-is\u00f4h h\u00e2ghoor.\n\nThe suffix when used is placed between the noun and its postposition, as:\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| Nom. a horse h\u00e2ghoor-un. h\u00e2ghoor-ints. |\n| Gen. of a horse h\u00e2ghoor-un-\u00ea. h\u00e2ghoor-ints-\u00ea. |\n| Dat. to a horse h\u00e2ghoor-un-er. h\u00e2ghoor-ints-er. |\n| Acc. a horse h\u00e2ghoor-un. h\u00e2ghoor-ints. |\n| Abl. on a horse h\u00e2ghoor-un-ett\u00e9. h\u00e2ghoor-ints-ett\u00e9. |\n| in a horse h\u00e2ghoor-un-\u00fbloo. h\u00e2ghoor-ints-\u00fbloo. |\n| with a horse h\u00e2ghoor-un-\u00e9k\u00e2t. h\u00e2ghoor-ints-\u00e9k\u00e2t. |\n| for a horse h\u00e2ghoor-un-\u00e9gunn\u00e9. h\u00e2ghoor-ints-\u00e9gunn\u00e9. |\n| by or from a horse h\u00e2ghoor-un-te\u00fbm. h\u00e2ghoor-ints-te\u00fbm. |\n| Voc. oh horse leh h\u00e2ghoor. leh h\u00e2ghoor. |\n\nAn adjectival noun is sometimes formed by adding the termination kish to a common noun, as: imos \u2018anger,\u2019 imos-kish \u2018an angry person,\u2019 but it is not employed as a simple adjective. \u2018He became angry\u2019 would be imos manimi.\n\n**The Adjectives.**\n\nThe adjective precedes the substantive, as shown above. It is not declined. Adjectives that terminate in o change\nthe termination to \\( t \\) when in conjunction with a feminine substantive in the singular. No difference is made in the plural, or in adjectives that terminate in \\( um \\).\n\n**Pronominal Substantives and Adjectives.**\n\nA number of substantives and adjectives have pronominal prefixes, without which they are never used, and which are employed according to the relation of the noun to which they are prefixed. Each has seven forms; thus, to express 'head' it is necessary to say 'my head,' 'your head,' etc.; but there is no word for 'head' in the abstract. For instance:\n\n| My head | ai-yetis. | Her head | moo-yetis. |\n|---------|-----------|----------|------------|\n| Thy head | go-yetis. | Our head | mi-yetis. |\n| His head | i-yetis. | Your head | mai-yetis. |\n| Their head | oo-yetis. |\n\nWhen applied to animals or objects, the forms of the third persons singular and plural are used. The prefix is nearly the same in all pronominal words, both substantive and adjective.\n\nThe use of the regular pronouns is not obviated by these prefixes, but they are employed in addition; nor are the plural terminations discarded, as:\n\n- **My head aches**\n  - J\u00e0 aiyetis akholjibi.\n- **What is thy name?**\n  - Oom\u00e9 goo-ik bessun dila?\n- **She had (lit. saw) a dream**\n  - Kin\u00e9 molj\u00ec-un y\u00e9tsaobo.\n- **Your tongues speak**\n  - M\u00e2 moo-musho gharichib\u00ec\u00f9n.\n- **Their brothers have gone**\n  - Oo\u00e9 ochook\u00f3n nib\u00e0n.\n\nThese substantives all denote objects or attributes which belong to a single individual, possession of which cannot be shared, such as 'head,' 'dream,' 'temper,' 'father,' 'wife,' etc.\n\nThe pronominal adjectives are compounds formed from the above substantives, as, \\( es \\)-shok\u00f9m 'generous,' from \\( es \\) (pronom. subs.) 'heart,' and \\( shok\u00f9m \\) 'wide,' the prefix being changed either according to the person of the verb it governs or is governed by, and denoting qualities which cannot be shared, as:\n\n- **I became independent**\n  - Jeh \u00e1s-goor\u00f9mun man\u00e1m.\n- **His father is brave**\n  - In\u00e9 yoo es-d\u00e1g\u00e0h\u00e0ntsun bai.\n- **My wife is timid**\n  - J\u00e0 ows moo-sgoos\u00e0sun bo.\n- **We are clever**\n  - M\u00ecp mil-chikoyo bap.\nThe following list comprises nearly all the pronominal substantives:\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| **1st Pers.** | **2nd Pers.** | **3rd Pers. Masc.** | **3rd Pers. Fem.** | **1st Pers.** | **2nd Pers.** | **3rd Pers.** |\n| Anger | \u00e1mos | goomos | imos | moomos | mimos | m\u00e1mos | oomos. |\n| Arm | tehuck | gooshuck | ishuck | mooashuck | mishuck |

No difference is made in the first and second persons plural: \u00e9 is added to the third person sometimes, but is not obligatory:\n\nI went Jeh niyum.\nI saw the man Jeh sisa-un y\u00e9tsum.\nThou sawest the man Oom\u00e9 sisa-un y\u00e9tsooma.\nShe went Kin nimo.\nHe saw the man Int\u00e9 sisa-un y\u00e9tsimi.\nThey will come Koo joochen.\nThey saw me Oo\u00e9 jeh aiy\u00e9tsoomum.\n\nWhen reference is made to objects or animals, the following forms, which are not applicable to human beings, are used:\n\n| this | this |\n|------|------|\n| khoe, masc. | esa, masc. |\n| khot, fem. | et, fem. |\n| kh\u00f3de, masc. | es\u00e9, masc. |\n| kh\u00f3te, fem. | et\u00e9, fem. |\n| khota. | etc. |\n| kh\u00f3ted. | etc\u00e9. |\n\nThis is the horse Khos h\u00faghoor bi\nThis water is good Khot t\u00e1l\u00ed tultus dila\nThis is better than that Khos-ess\u00e9-t\u00e1um tultus bi.\n\n**Reflective Pronouns.**\n\nThe reflective pronoun is formed by a reduplication of the personal pronoun:\n\n| I myself | Jeh j\u00e9. |\n| thou thyself | oom gool or goo gool. |\n| he himself | in t. |\n| she herself | in moot. |\n| it itself (masc.) | esa t. |\n| it itself (fem.) | et t. |\n| we ourselves | min min. |\n| you yourselves | m\u00e1h maiyl. |\n| they themselves | oo oof. |\n| they themselves (objects) | etc t. |\n\nThe genitive is formed by using the personal and possessive pronouns together \u2014 jah jehimoh, oom\u00e9 gooimoh, in\u00e9 lyimoh, etc.:\n\n**Dative.**\n\nakherer.\ngookherer.\nikherer.\nmookherer.\nmikherer.\nmakherer.\nookherer.\n\n**Accusative.**\n\nSame as nominative.\nPossessive Pronouns.\n\nThe possessive is also indicated by the following form:\n\nmine jehimoh. her mooyimoh.\nthine goomimoh. ours mlyimoh.\nhis iyimoh. yours maiymoh.\ntheirs ooyimoh.\n\nExamples.\n\nMy house jehimoh h\u00e1h.\nHer horse mooyimoh h\u00e1ghoor.\nHis mother's head in\u00e9 imimoh mooyimoh mooyetis.\nI wish you to teach me your language; in return I will teach you mine. jah ruck ech\u00e1b goomimoh b\u00e1sh aikin; \u00e9tte budul jehimoh b\u00e1sh oomer goykum.\nThe cows which you saw were ours booom be yotsoom\u00e1 et\u00e9 miyimoh bi\u00fan.\n\nInterrogative Pronouns.\n\nThe interrogative pronoun is expressed by \u00e1min or menun when relating to human beings, and \u00e1mis (masc.) and \u00e1mit (fem.) when relating to animals or objects, as:\n\nWhich horse is this? Khos dmiis h\u00e1ghoor bi.\nWhich milk is best? \u00c1mit m\u00e1moo t\u00faltus dila.\nWhose horse is this? Khos h\u00e1ghoor dm\u00ednd bi.\nWhose house did you enter? Ooom min\u00e9 h\u00e1l\u00e9 n\u00edbum.\nWhose is this? Khos dm\u00ednd bi.\n\nRelative Pronouns.\n\nThe relative is expressed by using be with the personal pronoun, as:\n\nI who went J\u00e9h be niyum.\nI who saw the man Jah be sissun y\u00e9tsum.\nThis is the man who went Be nimi in\u00e9 siss bai.\nThe horse which I saw H\u00e1ghoor be y\u00e9tsum.\nThis is the man I saw Jah be y\u00e9tsum in\u00e9 siss bai.\n\nIndefinite Pronouns.\n\nK\u00fats and men are used in the sense that wallah is employed in Hindoostani, but are not used to make into verbal substantives as in that language, as:\n\nA person of Hunza Hunzoo k\u00fatsun\nNager people N\u00e1ger k\u00fatak.\nSomebody must go Menun niyuss \u00e1w\u00e1ji.\nPREPOSITIONS.\n\nBesides *kat* 'with' and *yer* 'before,' which are suffixed to the noun they govern, certain prepositions have pronominal forms\u2014\n\n|      | Mr.     | This.   | Him.    | His.    | Us.     | You.    | Them.   |\n|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| near | opuch   | goopuch | epuch   | mopuch  | mipuch  | mapuch  | opuch   |\n| behind | alji  | goolji  | ilji    | moolji  | milji   | m\u00e1lji  | coold   |\n| accompanying | ak\u00e2t | gok\u00e2t | ek\u00e2t   | mook\u00e2t  | mk\u00e2t     | mbi\u00e2t | ok\u00e2t    |\n| before | aiyer | gooyer | fy\u00e9r   | mooyer  | maiy\u00e9r  | maiy\u00e9r  | ooy\u00e9r   |\n| preceding | \u00e1ngi | g\u00fang\u00ef    | ingi   | mo\u00f3ngtipu   | mi\u00e1g\u00ef   | m\u00e1ng\u00ef   | \u00f1\u00e1ng\u00ef   |\n| like  | \u00e1sh\u00e2iski | gu\u00e1sh\u00e2sk\u00ee | i\u00e1sh\u00e2jumpa   | m\u00fash\u00e2aski | mish\u00e2iski | mush\u00e2asi | oo\u00f3sh\u00e2fit |\n\nExample.\n\n\"He was standing in front of me; when I began to go, he went behind my brother.\"\n\n\"Alloc nee maybe tsuat diebum; iega niumulo, ja \u0161ch\u016bo ilj\u00ec nimi.\"\nThe Negative.\n\nThe simple negative 'no' is expressed by b\u00e9. 'Not' is expressed by \u00e1pi, which is apparently a compound of the word bi 'is,' with the negative \u00e1 affixed. For human beings \u00e1pai is used in the masculine and \u00e1po in the feminine, as:\n\nHave you see him? No Oom\u00e9 in y\u00e9tsoom\u00e1? B\u00e9.\nThis is not your gun Kos oom\u00e9 toom\u00e1k \u00e1pi.\nHe is not here In kol\u00e9h \u00e1pai.\nThe Queen is not in the house G\u00e1nish h\u00e1hl\u00e9 \u00e1po.\n\nA negative form is given to the verb by affixing ai, \u00e1, or. In compound verbs the negative is interposed, as:\n\nI will not do (it) Jah aiyechum.\nI do not know Jah \u00e1keyum.\nI am unable Jah owleyum.\nI will not forget Jeh till-ai-\u00e1lum.\nI have not forgotten Jeh till-ai-\u00e1lum.\n\nIf the verb already begins with ai, \u00e1 is interposed, as: aikenuss 'to teach me,' ai-\u00e1-kenuss 'not to teach me.'\n\nIf the verb already begins with \u00e1, ai is prefixed, as: \u00e1russs 'to send me,' ai-\u00e1russs 'not to send me.'\n\nThe Verb.\n\nThe verb is generally very regular with terminations expressing tense and person. The indefinite always ends in \u00e1ss, ess, or uss.\n\nA number of verbs conjugate the past participle as a tense. Among them are:\n\nto do or to make etnuss. to see y\u00e9tsuss.\nto bring dithuss. to come jooyes.\nto ask dogh\u00e1rdsuss. to go niyuss.\nto sleep g\u00facheyuss.\n\nAll tenses, except in the imperative mood, have different terminations of the 3rd person singular to express different genders of nouns or of persons.\n\nThe imperfect tense in the 1st person singular and plural, and the pluperfect in the 1st person singular, have two forms, which are used at pleasure without changing the meaning.\nTHE BOORISHKI LANGUAGE\n\nBy the use of uloo and ette with the perfect tense a gerund in the form of a tense is produced.\n\nThe conditional or potential mood is formed by the suffix ab\u00e9 'or not' to all tenses of the indicative mood.\n\n**The Verb.**\n\nConjugation of the verb 'To

After a time I sent one man, who having approached stood up carelessly. The hawk was alarmed by his standing up so that it flew away.

I had two hawks and a gun with me. The hawks caught one hare, two pigeons and six partridges. After that I sent three men home with my horse and the hawks and went up the valley with the others. After a short time we saw a herd of wild goats. We crept close, and I shot one wild goat with large horns. One man having taken it up went towards home. I went on to a further place and having arrived there, night came on, we slept under a big rock. The next day we ascended a very steep (lit. little-sloping) and high mountain, and saw a small herd of wild goats. While looking down I saw some men coming along the valley, but was not able to recognize them, (and as) we feared lest they should be enemies, therefore we went towards home.\n3.\n\nKoolto taiy kut niyabum b\u00e2ren\u00e1k\u00e9 hin sissun t\u00f2munett\u00e9 yett\u00e9 doosobum, tair\u00f9m\u00e0n\u00e9r taiy dullum h\u00edn sissun gharichoom\u00e9 dimi epuch d\u00ec degh\u00e0r\u00f9simi \u201coom yett\u00e9 bess doosob\u00e2?\u201d\n\nIn\u00e9 senimi \u201cbess bessun munna dila.\u201d Senuss\u00falooo d\u00e0 in\u00e9 senimi \u201c\u00e1w\u00e1, j\u00e1h munna etaba j\u00e0 koleh oom\u00e9 be bi.\u201d In\u00e9 senim\u00e9 \u201cshoo, jeh yett\u00e9 doosaba bareyum bessun echoom\u00e1k\u00e9, joo.\u201d Ett\u00e9 senuss-ett\u00e9 y\u00e0r\u00f9m in\u00e9 multsimi.\n\nMults\u00e0ss\u00falooo yett\u00f9m in\u00e9k\u00e9 multsimi tair\u00f9m\u00e0n\u00e9r y\u00e0r\u00f9m in\u00e9 yett\u00f9m in\u00e9 yekal daiyok dellimi.

VII.\u2014Grammatical Note on the Simn\u00fani Dialect of the Persian Language. By the Rev. James Bassett, American Missionary, Tabriz. [Communicated by Mr. R. N. Cusir, Hon. Secretary.]\n\nThe city of Simn\u00fan is about one hundred and sixty-five miles eastward from Tehran on the road from the latter city to Mashad.\n\nThe people of Simn\u00fan are noted for their vernacular, which is commonly called Simn\u00fani.\n\nThe anecdote is current in Persia that one of the kings of that country appointed a learned man to travel throughout his kingdom, and to investigate the Dialects spoken therein. The investigations having been completed, on a given day the king and court assembled to hear the learned doctor's report. The philologist discoursed of many Dialects, and then, referring to the vernacular of Simn\u00fan, took a dry and empty gourd, and putting a few pebbles therein, shook it aloft, saying, \"You now hear all that I can report of the Simn\u00fani.\"\n\nThis Dialect is spoken by all the people of Simn\u00fan, and also by the people of several villages a few farsang distant. It is said to be spoken also in the province of Mazanderan.\n\nIn the following pages I have given a brief outline of some of the grammatical forms, and a vocabulary, of this Dialect, which was prepared under my direction by a mullah of Simn\u00fan, himself a native of the place, and from infancy accustomed to its use. These forms and words, though few, will I hope serve a better purpose and be more intelligible than the rattle of the pebbles in the philologist's gourd.\n\nA number of books are written in this Dialect, which, from the peculiar forms of the verb and the sounds, afford much merriment to Persians accustomed only to the modern Persian.\nNOTE ON THE SIMNUNI DIALECT.\n\nThe Nouns.\n\nThe plural of nouns is formed by the suffix \u0649.

VIII.\u2014Etymology of the Turkish Numerals. By S. W. Koelle, Ph.D., Corresponding Member of the Royal Academy of Science in Berlin, and late Missionary of the Church Missionary Society in Constantinople.\n\nThe Etymology of Numerals, or the question what primary ideas originally furnished the names for the different numbers, is a matter of considerable obscurity and uncertainty in many languages. Professor Bopp, in his Comparative Grammar of the Sanscritic Languages, translated into English by Lieutenant Eastwick, says, in vol. i. p. 427: \"I do not think that any language whatever has produced special original words for the particular designation of such compacted and peculiar ideas as three, four, five, etc.; and as the appellations of numbers resist all comparison with the verbal bases, the pronominal bases remain the only means by which to explain them.\" To whatever extent this may be true respecting the Sanscritic languages, it does not apply to many others spoken in Africa and America; and from these some light may possibly be derived for the elucidation of the former. Even in Asia there is the extensive stock of Tartar languages, to which also the Turkish or Osmanli belongs, where the roots of words occupy so dominant a position, and can, with their primary meaning, be still so easily traced, that in regard to them the very reverse holds good of what Professor Bopp affirmed about the absence of connexion with verbal bases in the Sanscritic Numerals. Only so much is true, that\nalso in the Tartar languages the Numerals were originally not designations for the abstract idea of numeric order, but expressions, still capable of being understood, to mark certain peculiarities of the fingers, with whose help people used to count. From being at first ordinary appellatives, they gradually passed into Numerals, or mere symbolic representations of numbers, when their primary signification faded away from the people's mind.\n\nMy attention was first drawn to the natural connexion between the numbers and the fingers, when, more than thirty years ago, I compiled the Polyglotta Africana, i.e. a comparative vocabulary of all the languages spoken in Sierra Leone by its motley population of liberated Africans. Many hundreds of natives from every part of the continent passed through my hands in preparing that work; and as the Numerals were amongst the words of my collection, I had ample opportunity of becoming acquainted with the African mode of numeration. One thing which I could not help noticing in their manner of counting was, that they generally made use of their fingers, and sometimes, from 11 to 20, even of their toes. In doing so, they also regularly with the fore-finger of their right hand first counted the fingers of their left hand, beginning from the little one and ending with the thumb; and then with the fore-finger of the left hand they, in the same order, counted the fingers of the right. Some of the men from whom I obtained the specimens of their language were so dependent on this dactylic aid, that they became bewildered when I requested them to count without using their fingers. A few of this class were so limited to the most rudimental attainments in mathematics, that they could only count up to five; and when I expressed my surprise as to how they could find this sufficient for the transactions of daily life, one of them replied, \"We can manage very well: for having counted five, we put it aside on one heap and then begin another, and so on, as many as we may want.\"\n\nThe practice of calling in the help of fingers and toes for the purpose of counting, which I could still observe\namongst many African tribes, probably already existed in\nthe remotest antiquity of the nations and languages of man-\nkind, and was continued unchanged, with other primeval\nhabits, by those children of nature in their secluded \"dark\ncontinent\" all these thousands of years. There can be little\ndoubt that at that early period of the world's history, when\nthe languages now spoken over the face of the earth were\nstill in the process of primitive formation, that same practice\nuniversally prevailed amongst the tribes and nations not\nmerely in Africa, but on every continent where man was\nfound, and that the mathematical genius of our own an-\ncestors was by no means elevated above it. For it is this\nantique and pristine habit of counting by the help of the\nfingers which constituted the natural foundation, and now\nforms the only satisfactory explanation of the fact that, in\nalmost all the languages of mankind, the system of numera-\ntion reposes on either a quinary, or a decimal, or a vigesimal\nbase, or one composed of two or all of these; that is to say,\nthat people count either up to five (viz. the fingers of one\nhand), or to ten (viz. the fingers of both hands), or to twenty\n(viz. the fingers and toes), and then repeat or compound\nthese highest with the preceding smaller numbers. Accord-\ningly, all languages have distinct names for the Numerals\nup to five, and many up to ten. Those resting on a quinary\nbase call six \"five and one,\" seven \"five and two,\" eight\n\"five and three,\" nine \"five and four\"; but for ten they\nform again a distinct name. The numbers from 11 to 19\nare compounds of ten with the units 1 to 9; and for twenty\nthere is again a distinct word. Beyond twenty they com-\npound in the same manner as beyond ten, and then assume\neither a decimal or a vigesimal character, according as they\nprovide a new name for every decade or for every score.\nThese three bases of numeration\u2014five, ten, twenty\u2014are so\nnatural and do so readily, one might almost say, with a\nkind of physical necessity, suggest themselves to every man\nby the number of his fingers and toes, that it is really a\nmatter of surprise they have not been unexceptionally and\nexclusively adopted. But though the Five and its multiples\nalmost universally prevail, there are also some few languages which build up their system of numeration on the basis of six, twelve, twenty-four. They are so few, compared with the others, as to appear only in the light of rare exceptions. Our word 'dozen,' as far as its use is concerned, seems to belong to a like category. What is the cause or natural foundation for this exceptional mode of numeration does not appear so plain: perhaps it proceeded from the still simpler principle of 'three' and may not be unconnected with a pronominal source, as suggested by Prof. Bopp. The occurrence of such a numeration being exceedingly rare and having even been questioned, it may not be superfluous to adduce an instance here. It belongs to the B\u00f4la or Bur\u00e2ma language, spoken on the west coast of Africa between Senegambia and Sierra Leone, where they count thus: 1, pul\u00f3lo; 2, k\u00e9taw; 3, k\u00f3ayents; 4, keb\u00e2kr; 5, k\u00e1y\u00ean; 6, p\u00e2d\u0161i or p\u00e2i; 7, p\u00e2d\u0161i na pulo; 8, b\u00e1kirei; 9, kahye\u1e45galo; 10, iny\u00ean; 11, d\u00fbkena; 12, \u014bgep\u00e2d\u0161 \u014bgitm. As here 'twelve' or \u014bgep\u00e2d\u0161 \u014bgitm means evidently 'twice six,' so also 'twenty-four' or \u014bgep\u00e2d\u0161 \u014bkeb\u00e2kr, 'four times six,' and 'seven,' or p\u00e2d\u0161i na pulo, 'six and one.' The base of numeration, therefore, is 'six,' instead of 'five.'\n\nHaving once, by ocular observation, my attention drawn to the intimate connexion of the quinary, decimal and vigesimal systems of numeration with the human fingers, or with the fingers and toes, it was natural to look to the same source also for light on the proper and original meaning of the several Numerals. Engaged with the study of the Vei language amongst the people who speak it about Cape Mount, my expectation on that point first began to be gratified. The Veiese count thus up to twenty: d\u00f3ndo, f\u00e9ra, s\u00e1gba, n\u00e1n\u00ed, s\u00f3ru; s\u00fcnd\u00f3ndo, s\u00fcmf\u00e9ra, s\u00fcns\u00e1gba, s\u00fcnn\u00e1n\u00ed, ta\u00f1; t\u00e1nd\u00f3ndo, t\u00e1mf\u00e9ra, t\u00e3ns\u00e1gba, tann\u00e1n\u00ed, t\u00e3ns\u00f3ru; t\u00e2n s\u00fcnd\u00f3ndo, t\u00e2n s\u00fcns\u00e1gba, t\u00e2n s\u00fcnn\u00e1n\u00ed, m\u00f3bande. The etymology of at least three or four of these Numerals soon became clear to me. D\u00f3ndo is evidently a compound of do 'small:' 'small-small' or very small, smallest, as a designation of the little finger (of the left hand), the first in being counted.\nThe n of do-n-do is an evolved consonant, which we have also in f\u00e9rande\u00f1, a twin, lit. a 'two-child,' from fera 'two' and de\u00f1 'child.' The original meaning of fera must have been that of companionship, association, addition in general, and therefore it took its place in the language both as a Preposition 'with,' and as a Numeral 'two,' the latter being the first and therefore characteristic companion or addition of number one. Ta\u00f1 'ten' seems connected with da\u00f1a 'to stay, stop; be at an end, be finished;' for after having counted the fingers, a stop naturally took place before proceeding with the toes; and da\u00f1 means 'to count.' M\u00f6b\u00e4nde is a regular compound of m\u00f6 'man, person,' and bande 'finished,' the usual participle passive of the Verb ba\u00f1 'to finish:' because with 'twenty' one person was finished, that is, all his fingers and toes were counted. M\u00f6 fera bande or 'forty,' means 'two persons finished,' etc. I was surprised that the Veiese had entirely lost sight of the original and manifest import of the word m\u00f6b\u00e4nde, and that in counting they used it merely as a symbol, like all the other Numerals; but as soon as I had called their attention to its proper etymology, they unhesitatingly fell in with it and affirmed its correctness. Strange to say, in the Greenlandish language the word for 'twenty' has the very same signification as in Vei, from which it may perhaps be inferred that the people who spoke it first lived in a milder climate, and had their naked toes more easily at their disposal for counting, than is now the case in Greenland. A striking confirmation of this finger-theory is also furnished by the Suto or Basuto language, where, as a friend lately informed me, the word for 'six' properly signifies 'jump over:' obviously because, in counting the number six, one 'jumps over' from the fingers of the left hand to those of the right.\n\nWhen, with this knowledge of African numeration and Numerals, I afterwards came to Constantinople and my duties as a Missionary to the Turks rendered it incumbent on me thoroughly to acquaint myself with their language by exhausting etymological researches, I found the Turkish\nNumerals no less transparent and no less easily reducible to their roots than Tartar words in general, and confirmatory, in a most remarkable manner, of my African theory about the primitive signification of numbers. The present treatise professing to set forth the etymology of all the Turkish Numerals, it will have to trace them to their source, and to point out the exact reasons from which the ancient Tartars, the ancestors of the present Turks, originally designated their numbers by the names which they still bear, and which at the first were not special words to express the abstract idea of numeric order, but general appellations relating to the fingers employed in counting, and only in the course of time turned into those purely symbolic terms which practically they now are.\n\nThe Turkish language has only twenty distinct and proper words to express numbers; and with their help all the other Numerals are represented. They are the names for the ten Units, the eight Tens, one for 'hundred' and one for 'thousand,' as given here:\u20141, \u0628\u06cc\u0631 (bir); 2, \u0627\u06cc\u06a9\u06cc (\u00e9ki); 3, \u0627\u0648\u0686 (\u00fc\u00e7); 4, \u062f\u0648\u0631\u062a (d\u00f6rt); 5, \u0628\u0634 (be\u015f); 6, \u0627\u0644\u06cc (\u00e1lti); 7, \u0628\u06cc\u062f\u06cc (y\u00e9d\u0131); 8, \u0633\u06a9\u0632 (s\u00e9kiz); 9, \u0637\u0648\u0642\u0648\u0632 (t\u00f3quz); 10, \u0627\u0648\u0646 (\u00f6n); 20, (y\u00e9kirmi, y\u00e9rmi); 30, \u0627\u0648\u062a\u0648\u0632 (\u00f3tuz); 40, \u0642\u06cc\u0631\u0642 (q\u0131rq); 50, (\u00e1ltm\u0131\u015f); 60, (y\u00e9tm\u0131\u015f); 70, (y\u00e9tmi\u015f); 80, (s\u00e9ksan); 90, (t\u00f3gsan); 100, (y\u00fcz); 1000, \u0628\u06cc\u0646 (b\u0131n).\n\n(1) \u0628\u06cc\u0631 (bir), one. This number, according to the primitive mode of counting with the aid of the fingers, answers to the little finger of the left hand. As the Wei derived its name from the size of this finger (viz. dondo, 'small-small'), so the Turkish fixed upon its position, as hithermost in regard to the person who counts, and foremost respecting the fingers and numbers that are to follow. The word Bir therefore designates the number One, as that which is before, hitherwards, antecedent, in regard to all the other numbers. The same root has also settled in the language as the Noun and Preposition \u0628\u06cc\u0631 (b\u00e9r-i), signifying 'the hither side, this side; hitherward, since;' and as a Verb, viz. \u0648\u0631\u0645\u06a9 (v\u00e9r-mek), which in Tshagatai has still the\nbir-mek) 'to give, to present;' properly, 'to bring forward, to advance something for someone else.' In more distant relationship to it stands r\u0101r-maq (r\u0101r-maq) 'to proceed, go forward to, reach,' in Tshagatai b\u0101r-maq (b\u0101r-maq). This Tartar root, with essentially the same meaning, is also widely spread in the Indo-European languages, where, however, its first consonant is sometimes aspirated, sometimes sharpened, e.g. Engl. fir-st, fore, before; fare; German fir-\u00df, f\u00fcr-\u00df; vor; f\u00fchran, f\u00fchran; Latin pr\u00e6, pro, per; primus; Greek \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf, \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4; \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1; Sanscr. \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935 (pur) procedere, \u092a\u0942\u0930\u092e (p\u016br-am) ante, coram, \u092a\u0942\u0930\u093e (p\u016br-a) antea, \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935 (p\u016br-ra) prior, etc.\n\n(2) \u0627\u06cc\u06a9\u06cc (\u00e9k-i), tico. This is a Noun with a passive signification, regularly formed from the Verb \u0627\u0645\u06a9 (\u00e9k-mek), 'to sow (seed), to sprinkle (salt, etc.)'; in Tshagatai \u0627\u06cc\u06a9\u0645\u06a9 (ik-mek) 'to sow, to insert.' The sowing is a throwing or casting of the seed, and therefore the Noun ek-i signifies anything thrown down or added to something else: an addition. Two being the first and, on this account, the characteristic addition to one, the second Numeral could consistently be represented by a word signifying addition, just as in Vei by one signifying companion, fellow. The succeeding additions, being no longer new and characteristic, could not in like manner supply names of a similar import for the following numbers. In Tshagatai another Noun is formed from the same Verb to designate the peculiar addition of what is, \"thrown into the bargain,\" and also of a \"patch,\" viz. \u0627\u06cc\u06a9\u0644\u06a9 (ik-l\u0131k). Other instances of Nouns formed like ek-i, by the mere addition of i to the root, are:\n\n\u062c\u06a9\u06cc (j\u00e9k-i) 'a horse-load,' from \u062c\u06a9\u0645\u06a9 (j\u00e9k-mek) 'to draw, drag, carry;' \u0633\u0627\u062c\u06cc (s\u00e1g-i), 'small coins scattered at weddings,' from \u0633\u0627\u062c\u0645\u06a9 (s\u00e1g-maq), 'to scatter;' \u06cc\u0627\u0632\u06cc (y\u00e1z-i) 'a writing, inscription,' from \u06cc\u0627\u0632\u0645\u06a9 (y\u00e1z-maq), 'to write;' \u06cc\u0627\u0631\u06cc (y\u00e1ri) 'a half,' from \u06cc\u0627\u0631\u0645\u06a9 (y\u00e1r-maq), 'to split, to cleave.' The particular reason, which originally may have suggested the designation of the second Numeral as a mere addition or appendage to the first, was probably the characteristic peculiarity of the finger next to the little one of the\nleft hand, to which it corresponded in counting, and which is the weakest, most dependent of all our fingers, slavishly following its neighbour in all its movements, so that from this want of independence and character it has in several languages been called the \"nameless\" one.\n\n(3) \u0663 (\u00fc\u011f, Zenker in his Dictionary adds, vulg. y\u00fc\u011f) three. The third Numeral corresponds to the third or middle finger of the left hand which rises or tops above all the rest; and from the surpassing height of this middle finger the third Numeral has derived its appellation. \u0663 (\u00fc\u011f) 'three,' and \u0664 (\u00fc\u011f) 'end, point, top, farthest limit, utmost or upmost end,' are one and the same root, and were originally identical. Under the influence of the soft vowels of the second and fourth Numerals the u of the third naturally soon softened into \u00fc. The change of harsh into soft vowels is something very common in the Tartar languages, and they are sometimes interchanged by the people of the same country; e.g. Vambery in his Tshagatai vocabulary writes \u0627\u0648\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0642 'to fly up' with u, \u0627\u0648\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0643 'to go out, extinguish,' with \u00f6; but Shaw, in his Specimens from Eastern Turkestan, writes the former och-maq and the latter uch-mak; again Vambery writes \u0627\u0648\u062c 'revenge' both with u and \u00fc, Shaw with u only and Zenker with \u00f6 only. The latter has the vowel \u00fc in \u0627\u0648\u062c 'three,' but u in \u0627\u0648\u062c\u0648\u0627 'the three,' and in \u0627\u0648\u062c\u0648\u0627\u0648 'all the three.' The ordinary Dictionaries give the vowel u to the Verb \u0627\u0648\u062c\u0645\u0686 'to fly up, to rise high;' but \u00fc and rarely u to the Adjective \u0627\u0648\u0686\u0647 or \u0627\u0648\u0686\u0647 'high,' which comes from the same root. The third Numeral, instead of connecting itself with \u0627\u0648\u062c might also have attached itself to \u0627\u0686 (i\u011f) 'inside, middle;' for as the third finger is the highest, so it also occupies an interior or intermedial position amongst the other fingers, having two on either side, wherefore in many languages it is called \"the middle finger.\" But in Turkish \u0627\u0686 (\u00fc\u011f) 'three,' can hardly be derived from \u0627\u0686 (i\u011f) 'inside,' because i does not easily pass into \u00fc. Nevertheless there is an etymological relationship of a different kind between \u0627\u0648\u062c (\u00fc\u011f, \u00fc\u011f) and \u0627\u0686 (i\u011f); they respectively express the\nopposite but correlative notions of out and in, high and deep, and are held together, as it were, by the band of the neutral \n(\u0101\u011f), which, in the Verb (\u0101\u011f-maq) \u2018to open,\u2019 denotes an activity for affording both egress and ingress, according to circumstances. Professor Bopp, on p. 427 of the work already quoted, makes a remark containing both truth and error, which deserves to be noticed here. It is to this effect: \u201cOnly in three might one perhaps think of the Sanscrit base (tri) \u2018to pass over,\u2019 and consider three as the more than two. This verbal notion of passing over, adding, is, however, also the only possible one which could be blended with the names of numbers.\u201d Had Prof. Bopp paid attention to the correspondence between the Numerals and the fingers, he would have expressed himself differently. It is a remarkable confirmation of the theory I am illustrating that, in spite of his preconceived notions, he has to connect the Numeral three with the Sanscrit Verb (tri) \u2018to surpass.\u2019 But he is quite wrong in supposing that the reason is because three is \u201cmore\u201d than two. The idea of addition could only furnish the name for two, where it is new and characteristic, but not for any of the numbers following, which all equally exceed their predecessors. The reason why three is called the \u201csurpassing\u201d number in the Sanscritic languages and the \u201cend\u201d or \u201ctop\u201d number in Turkish, is not because it numerically exceeds two, but because the finger which symbolizes it surpasses all his fellows in height.\n\n(4) \u062f\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0631\u064e\u062a\u064c (d\u00f6rt) four. The Verb from which this Numeral is derived is still in common use, namely, (d\u00f6r-t-mek), in eastern Turkish, according to Shaw, still (t\u00fcr-t-mak, with u) \u2018to poke, push, stir up, rouse, drive away.\u2019 The fourth finger, i.e. the finger next to the thumb of the left hand, was therefore regarded as the one with which we stir up, rouse, awaken, incite, chase away; or perhaps also\u2014seeing that the Noun (d\u00f6r-t-i) signifies \u2018prick, point\u2019\u2014the one with which we point, show the direction: the \u201cindex,\u201d in Germ. Zeigfinger, as his brother on the right hand is still generally called. As\nregards its form, \u062f\u0648\u0631\u062a\u0645\u06a9 (d\u00f6r-t-mek) is an enlarged root by the addition of t, which imparts a causative and sometimes an intensive force, and it corresponds to the eastern \u062a\u0648\u0631\u063a\u0648\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0642 (t\u00fcr-yuz-maq) \u2018to rouse, raise, stir up,\u2019 from \u062f\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06a9 (d\u00f6r-maq) \u2018to stand up, to rise.\u2019 Of a similar formation is \u0628\u0648\u0631\u062a\u0645\u06a9 (b\u00fcr-t-mek) or \u0628\u06cc\u0631\u062a\u0645\u06a9 (b\u00e9r-t-mek) \u2018to wrench, sprain, dislocate,\u2019 from \u0628\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06a9 (b\u00fcr-maq) \u2018to turn;\u2019 also: \u067e\u06cc\u0648\u0646\u0645\u06a9 (y\u00f6n-t-maq) \u2018to cut or mend (a pen),\u2019 from \u067e\u06cc\u0648\u0646\u0645\u06a9 (y\u00f6n-maq) \u2018to cut or dress the sides (\u06cc\u0627\u0646=\u067e\u06cc\u0648\u0646) of timber.\u2019 All the simple roots which can thus be enlarged terminate in \u0631 or \u0646 or \u0644, and the single consonants by which this enlargement is effected are \u0628 \u067e \u062c \u062a \u0628 \u06a9.\n\n(5) \u0628\u0634 (besh) five. There can be no doubt that \u0628\u0634 \u2018five,\u2019 and \u0628\u0627\u0634 (b\u0101\u0161) \u2018head,\u2019 were originally one and the same word, so that the number five was called the head-number, because it corresponded with the thumb of the left hand, which, when the hand is closed, rises above the other fingers as the head above the body. When once the word was regularly employed as a Numeral in counting, it was natural to change its pronunciation a little, so as to distinguish it from its usual form with its primary meaning. In all the Turkish dialects the thumb is still ordinarily called \u0628\u0627\u0634 \u067e\u0627\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0642 (b\u0101\u0161 p\u0101rmag), i.e. \u2018head-finger,\u2019 and in Arabic and Persian \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0648\u0642\u06cc (el-f\u014dqi), i.e. \u2018the upper one.\u2019 According to A. Castr\u00e9n\u2019s Grammar, p. 17, the Koibals pronounce \u0628\u0634 with the vowels i and e, and the Karagassians even with the diphthong ei.\n\n(6) \u0627\u0644\u062a\u06cc (al-t-i) six. This means properly the \u201clow\u201d number, or the number \u201cbelow,\u201d from the still current \u0627\u0644\u062a (al-t) \u2018the under part, the space below; under, below.\u2019 No more striking proof can be required, of the agreement between the ancient Tartars and the Negroes of Africa, in their mode of using the fingers for the purpose of numeration, than the name of this Numeral. It could not have been better chosen, had it been specially invented with the view of illustrating our theory. For if Five, as answering to the thumb of the left hand, is called the head or upper number, what can be more natural, one might almost say\nmore compulsory, than to take the name for Six from the corresponding low position of the little finger of the right hand, or to call Six the underling of Captain Five? We may also observe, in regard to its etymological character, that the root \u0627\u0644\u062a (al-t) is parallel to \u062f\u0648\u0631\u062a (d\u00f6r-t): it is not a perfectly simple or primary, but an enlarged or developed root. Its naked form is \u0627\u0644 (al), as in the Verb \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0642 (al-maq) \u2018to take, to hold;\u2019 so that it appears the ancient Tartars regarded the under part of a thing as \u201ctaking\u201d or \u201cholding\u201d what was above it, just as we say a vessel \u201ctakes\u201d or \u201cholds\u201d what has room in it.\n\n(7) \u064a\u062f\u06cc (y\u00e9d-i), seven. As \u0627\u0644\u062a (al-t-i) \u2018six,\u2019 can etymologically be only derived from \u0627\u0644\u062a (al-t) \u2018under,\u2019 and \u0627\u06cc\u06a9\u06cc (\u00e9k-i) \u2018two,\u2019 from \u0627\u06cc\u06a9\u0645\u06a9 (\u00e9k-mek) \u2018to sow, to throw;\u2019 so also \u064a\u062f\u06cc (y\u00e9d-i) \u2018seven,\u2019 can only be formed from \u064a\u062f\u0645\u06a9 (y\u00e9d-mek) \u2018to lead a horse by the hand, to tow a vessel, to draw after, or cause to follow anything.\u2019 Another Noun derived from this Verb is \u064a\u062f\u06a9 (y\u00e9d-ek), which means \u2018a led horse, a ship or boat in tow, the rope by which the horse is led or the ship towed.\u2019 The appellation of the seventh Numeral is therefore a most correct and striking characteristic of the finger next to the little one on the right hand, which, with its brother on the left, is of all our fingers the weakest and least independent, submissively following its little neighbour in all its movements, like a led horse, or a ship in tow. As the Latin language calls the one secundus, from sequi, to follow, so the Sanscrit names the other \u0633\u067e\u0646 (sip-tan) from \u0633\u067e (sap) sequi, and the Turkish \u064a\u062f\u06cc (y\u00e9d-i) from \u064a\u062f\u0645\u06a9 (y\u00e9d-mek) \u2018to be led after, to follow behind.\u2019\n\nThese are facts which show a close observation of nature and a truly remarkable agreement in the systems of numeration belonging to languages so widely different as the Arian and the Tartar, and yet strongly confirming our African finger-theory. In point of etymology it may be observed that \u064a\u062f\u0645\u06a9 (y\u00e9d-mek) \u2018to lead a horse, to tow a vessel,\u2019 seems to have been originally identical with and only gradually to have separated its form from \u064a\u062a\u0645\u06a9 (y\u00e9t-mek), in eastern Turkish \u064a\u062a\u0645\u06a9 (yit-mek, y\u00e9t-mek) \u2018to\nreach, to suffice:\u2019 for in meaning both Verbs are closely allied, the following of a led horse or a towed vessel being in effect, as it were, a continual effort to \u201creach\u201d w precedes. Perhaps the eastern dialects do not yet make use of the forms \u064a\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0643\u0650\u0646\u064f (y\u00e9d-mek) and \u064a\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0643\u0650\u0646\u064f (y\u00e9d-ek), so do not find them in the usual eastern vocabularies, but their stead only \u064a\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0643\u0650\u0646\u064f (yit-mek, y\u00e9t-mek) \u2018to reach,\u2019 \u064a\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0643\u0650\u0646\u064f (y\u00e9t-ek) \u2018a led horse,\u2019 and likewise \u064a\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0643\u0650\u0646\u064f (y\u00e9t-i) \u2018seven.\u2019 But the seventh Numeral tells also in this latter form \u064a\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0643\u0650\u0646\u064f (y\u00e9t-i) the same tale about its connexion with the seventh finger, as in the now usual form \u064a\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0643\u0650\u0646\u064f (y\u00e9d-i). The Numeral \u064a\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0643\u0650\u0646\u064f is the first of which the Tartar-Turl Dictionary, printed in Stambul by a learned Ottoman high position, attempts an explanation in these words: \u201coriginal form was \u064a\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0643\u0650\u0646\u064f (y\u00e9d-di), as designating the day which the week had reached its completion, the Sabt day.\u201d This explanation is right in connecting the Numeral with the Verb \u064a\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0643\u0650\u0646\u064f or \u064a\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0643\u0650\u0646\u064f or \u064a\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0643\u0650\u0646\u064f \u2018to reach, to deavour to reach by following:\u2019 but as the ancient Tartars no doubt had counted many things before they counted days of the week, they could hardly have remained without a name for \u201cseven,\u201d until the Sabbath day suggested it to them; and had the last day of the week provided a number with its name, we would naturally expect to meet also various other traces of a septenary character in the Tartar system of numeration, which is not the case. Therefore the last part of this explanation cannot well be entertained.\n\n(8) \u0633\u0650\u0643\u0650\u0651\u064a\u0652\u0632 (s\u00e9k-is), in eastern Turkish \u0633\u0650\u0643\u0650\u0651\u064a\u0652\u0632 (sik-is) ei. This is properly an Adjective derived from the Verb \u064a\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0643\u0650\u0646\u064f (s\u00e9k-mek) \u2018to jump, spring, bound; to rebound, glance, ricochet (like a projectile from a hard surface).\u2019 According to it describes the eighth or middle finger of the right hand as the rebounding or glancing-off finger, in reference to almost universally prevalent practice of snapping with the finger, when it glances off from the thumb, like a projectile from a curved surface. Shaw\u2019s vocabulary of eastern Turkish has \u0633\u0650\u0643\u0650\u0651\u064a\u0652\u0632 and \u0633\u0650\u0643\u0650\u0651\u064a\u0652\u0632 (s\u00e1k-is) for eight, and \u0633\u0650\u0643\u0650\u0651\u064a\u0652\u0632 (s\u00e1k-mak) for: \u2018to jump close-footed, to hop.\u2019 Bianchi in\nTurkish Dictionary gives us two words \u0633\u06a9\u0631 (s\u00e9k-is); the first he calls Persian, and assigns to it the meaning \"whip\" and \"woodman's axe,\" and the second is the Turkish Numeral. But they are unquestionably one and the same genuinely Turkish word, which in the first case designates the whip and the axe as rebounding in being used and in the second the middle finger as glancing off in snapping. The termination is or 'z occurs with a similar force also in the following words: \u0627\u06cc\u06a9\u06cc\u0632 (ek-is), lit. 'a two-ling,' i.e. 'a twin, twins,' from \u0627\u06cc\u06a9\u06cc (ek-i) 'two' (as in Veifrande\u00f1, 'a two-child'); \u062f\u06cc\u06af\u06cc\u0632 (de\u00f1-iz) 'the sea,' lit. 'the still, quiet, the pacific,' from \u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0645\u06a9 (di\u00f1-mek) 'to be still, quiet, calm;' because the sea stands still and does not 'go,' like the \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0645\u06a9 (ir-maq) or 'river;' \u062a\u06cc\u062c\u06cc\u0632 (tit-iz) 'peevish, cross,' from \u062f\u062a\u0645\u06a9 (dit-mek), or eastern \u062a\u06cc\u062a\u0645\u06a9 (tit-mek) 'to rend, tear in little pieces, to cast up wool as in carding it.' The Tartar-Turkish Dictionary already referred to seeks to explain the etymological origin of the eighth Numeral, by calling it \"the number which jumps beyond seven.\" But if this kind of jumping had occasioned the name, it could with equal propriety have been conferred upon any other numeral except one; for every number in this sense jumps, as it were, beyond that which precedes it. Our own explanation is therefore the only one which meets the case.\n\n\u062a\u0648\u0624\u0698 (t\u00f6q-uz) nine. The formation of this and the preceding Numeral are the same in principle; for the difference in the formative syllable is and uz is purely phonetic, the soft root sek requiring is and the hard root tog demanding uz. As the name for eight is derived from a peculiarity of the middle finger of the right hand as the \"snapping\" one, so the appellation for nine is taken from a quality of the index-finger of the same hand, as the \"touch\"-finger. If this finger is in some languages justly called the \"index\" or 3ei\u011fefinger, it is in others with no less propriety also termed the \"touching\" or \"feeling\" finger; for most people, when they wish carefully to examine anything by their sense of touch, make\nuse almost involuntarily of the finger next to their right thumb. Accordingly the ninth Numeral derives its name from the Verb \u0637\u0648\u0642\u0645\u06cc (t\u014dq-un-maq) \u2018to touch, examine by the sense of feeling,\u2019 which is itself derived from \u0637\u0648\u0642\u0648\u06cc (t\u014dq-u-maq) \u2018to weave, strike yarn together;\u2019 and this again from \u062a\u0648\u0642\u0645\u06cc (t\u014dq-maq, Tshagatai) \u2018to put together, attach,\u2019 with which the form of the Turkish noun \u0637\u0648\u0642\u0645\u06cc (t\u014dq-maq) \u2018a mallet, hammer, knocker,\u2019 coincides.\n\nThe Tartar-Turkish Dictionary is again right in connecting this Numeral with its verbal base, but as unlucky as before in the reason it assigns, saying: \u201c\u0637\u0648\u0642\u0632 or \u0637\u0648\u0642\u0632 (t\u014dq-us) is the number so near to ten as to \u2018touch\u2019 it.\u201d But Nine does not touch Ten more closely than it does Eight, and all the other numbers equally \u201ctouch\u201d their upper and their lower neighbour, and would thus be no less entitled to the appellation of \u201ctouch-number\u201d; therefore the reason assigned does not account for the selection of the name exactly in this case. In the three Numerals whose etymological elucidation has been attempted by the distinguished and learned author of the Tartar-Turkish Dictionary, he succeeded as regards their outward form; but not possessing the right key to the enigma, it is no discredit to him that he failed in solving the difficulty altogether.\n\n(10) \u0627\u0648\u0646 (\u014dn), in Yakutic \u064a\u0648\u0646 (y\u014dn) ten. This root is identical with that of the Verb \u0627\u0648\u0646\u0645\u06cc (\u014dn-maq), which Meninski renders by: findere, expectare; and Bianchi by: fendre, attendre; or with \u064a\u0648\u0646\u0645\u06cc (y\u014dn-maq) which means \u2018to split (wood), to cut or dress (the sides of) timber or stone.\u2019 From the latter comes the Noun \u064a\u0648\u0646\u063a\u0647 (y\u014dn-ya) or \u064a\u0648\u0646\u0642\u0627 (y\u014dn-q\u0101), and \u064a\u0648\u0646\u0645\u06cc (y\u014dn-un-ti) \u2018splinter, shavings and other offal in dressing timber.\u2019 In Tshagatai Vambery gives the meaning of \u0627\u0648\u0646 (\u014dn) by: \u2018the right hand, the toes, ten;\u2019 and that of the cognate \u0627\u0648\u0646\u06a9 (\u014dnk) by: \u2018right, good; the right, justice.\u2019 Now the missing link for connecting all these different meanings is nothing else than the etymological base upon which all these words rest, namely, the Noun \u064a\u0648\u0646 (y\u014dn) i.q. \u064a\u0627\u0646 (y\u0101n) \u2018side.\u2019 The connexion between side and ten is not very distant. Having counted up to ten,\nThe end of the fingers had been reached, so that they had\nnow to be left on one side, and the mind to turn in a new\ndirection. In Turkish \u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0631\u0645\u0647\u0643 (y\u0101n r\u0113rmek), lit. \u2018to give\nside\u2019) means: \u2018to stand aside, aloof, to withdraw from a\nthing.\u2019 In any language, to pass from the side of a thing,\nto turn aside from it, can give the idea: \u2018to cease, stop,\nstay in having any more to do with it.\u2019 The tenth Numeral\ntherefore characterized by its name \u0627\u0648\u0646 (\u014dn) or \u064a\u0648\u0646 (y\u014dn)\nthe first great turning-point (leaving one side and turning\nto another), the first necessary stoppage, halt, stay, the chief\nnatural waiting place in the progress of numeration. What\nmy African friend, who could only count five, told me,\n\u201cWhen we have counted thus far, we put it on one side\nand begin afresh,\u201d was also done mentally and figuratively\nby the nations who developed the decimal system. In one\ncontinued effort, and as it were without taking breath, the\ncreative genius of language had invented a new name for\nevery successive number up to ten, when the aid from the\nfingers was exhausted, and thus naturally a pause set in,\nand the question presented itself how to proceed farther.\nMany Negro tribes, after having done with their fingers,\ncalled the toes into requisition; and if the same thing was\ndone elsewhere, might it not explain the singular coincidence\nthat in Tshagatai and in German the same word is used\nfor toe and ten? At all events the number \u0627\u0648\u0646 (\u014dn) marks\na stop or end in one direction, and the turn for a new start\nin another. The former meaning was also seized upon and\nstill more plainly expressed by the language of the Kagma-\nsinians and Kanskois in Siberia, which, whilst agreeing\nwith the Turkish in the other Numerals, has, according\nto Klaproth\u2019s Asia Polyglotta, p. 160, for the number \u201cten\u201d\nthe new word \u201cbul,\u201d which plainly means \u201cend,\u201d from\n\u0628\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0643 (but-mek) \u2018to come to an end, to finish, terminate;\nto come out, germinate (plants).\u2019 Compare also\n(bil-ik) and \u0628\u0631\u062a\u0648\u0643 (b\u016bt-\u016bk) \u2018approaching the end, finishing,\u2019\nand \u0628\u0631\u062a\u0648\u0646 (b\u016bt-un) or \u0628\u062a\u0648\u0646 (b\u016bt-\u016bn) \u2018whole, complete, all.\u2019\nThe word \u064a\u0648\u0646 (y\u014dn) \u2018side,\u2019 as we see from the Verb \u064a\u0646\u0645\u0642\n(y\u014dn-maq) or \u0627\u0648\u0646\u0645\u0627\u0642 (\u014dn-maq) \u2018to split,\u2019 also suggests the\nidea of separating the two sides or halves of a whole, halving, dividing, severing, parting. This is another which would likewise lead us to the notion of division, sect separated portion, as the meaning of the Turkish Num which completes the first decade. The division of a wl into two equal parts or halves, closely corresponding to e other, also naturally suggests that similar corresponde and agreement which subsists between merit and recompe and constitutes the essence of justice, righteousness, rig Hence \u0627\u0648\u0646\u06a9 (\u0648) \u2018just, right, good,\u2019 and \u0627\u0648\u0646 (\u0648) \u2018the ri hand.\u2019 When we see in dictionaries that \u0627\u0648\u0646\u0645 (\u0648) means \u2018to heal, recover,\u2019 \u0627\u0648\u0646\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0642 (\u0648) \u2018to be heal \u0627\u0648\u0646\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0632 (\u0648) \u2018incurable,\u2019 \u0627\u0648\u0646\u0644\u062f\u064a\u062c\u064a (\u0648) \u2018reme etc., we may feel tempted to regard the healing as a mak whole, and to look upon the name of the tenth Numeral signifying a numeric whole, a complete decade; but meaning \u0627\u0648\u0646\u0643 (\u0648) seems to forbid us from taking t view, and to represent to us the healing only as a restorat to a suitable, right and good condition. We may here s notice the material identity between the Turkish name the first decade On, and the European name for the first u in the Latin un-us, German ein; and the change of the forn into \u0648\u0648\u0646\u0627 in the Tshawushian (see Kasem Beg\u2019s Gramm p. 54), and of latter into \u0648\u064a\u0646\u0627\u0633 in Lithuanian, \u0648\u064a\u0646\u0633 Lettish, and one (= \u0648\u0648\u0646) in English,\u2014a coincidence, which not of an etymological, is at any rate of a phonetic interes\n\n(20) \u064a\u064a\u0631\u0645\u064a (\u064a\u0643\u0631\u0645\u064a), but usually contracted into \u064a\u064a\u0631 twenty. This Numeral is evidently a compound, of wh the first part is \u064a\u0643\u064a (\u064a\u0643\u0631\u0645\u064a) or \u0627\u064a\u0643\u0649 (\u0643\u0631\u0645\u064a) \u2018two,\u2019 and second \u0627\u064a\u0631\u0645\u064a (\u064a\u0631\u0645\u064a, ir\u2019mi-i) \u2018its reaching,\u2019 so that whole literally means \u2018two its reaching, or its twice reach ing,\u2019 viz. \u2018to the end of ten, second arrival at a full decad or \u2018arrival at the end of two decades.\u2019 The Verb \u064a\u0643\u0631\u0645\u064a (ir-mek or er-mek), cognate with \u0627\u064a\u0631\u0645 (ir-mag) \u2018to go, flow,\u2019 signifies \u2018to reach, to attain to, to arrive at a plac and from it the verbal Noun \u0627\u064a\u0631\u0645 (ir-im, ir\u2019m) is regular formed. In counting the ten fingers for the first time stop or limit had been come to, which was indicated by\nname of the tenth Numeral; and when they were counted over again (or in their stead the toes), a second halt was occasioned by this new arrival at the goal, and this was expressed in like manner by the name for twenty, the second decade.\n\nThe Turkish language has manifested an originality, a vigour and productiveness far above other languages with which it shares the decimal character of numeration. For whilst these contented themselves, in forming the names for the Tens, with simply repeating the Units in a peculiar form, or in conjunction with the name for Ten, the Turkish made a desperate effort to produce distinct appellations, expressive of an intelligible meaning, for the second, third, fourth and fifth decade, in their respective last number; and only after having well-nigh exhausted the possible, stooped to the method of other mortals, by employing the Units in the formation of the names for 60, 70, 80 and 90. Only the Karagassians, a Turkish tribe near the river Yenisei, seem not to have followed the general Turkish imagination in its vigorous flight, but to have preferred the even march with compounds of the Unit and Ten throughout. According to A. Castren's Sprachlehre, p. 17, their Tens are as follows: 20 ihon, from ihi 'two,' and \u00f6n 'ten,' 30 \u00fc\u011fon, 40 t\u00f6rt\u00f6n, 50 bes\u00f6n, 60 allon, 70 yeton, 80 seheson, 90 tohoson.\n\n(30) \u0627\u0648\u0698\u0648\u0632 (\u00f3\u0142-us) thirty. The formation of this Numeral is similar to that of \u0633\u06a9\u0631 (s\u00e9k-is) 'eight,' and of \u0637\u0642\u0648\u0632 (t\u00f6q-us) 'nine.' It is derived from the Verb \u0627\u0648\u0698\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0642 (\u00f3\u0142-ur-maq) 'to sit, settle, rest, remain.' Therefore, when the ten fingers had been counted for the third time and the occasion was once more given for a pause or stop, the name for the thirtieth Numeral was taken from the idea of sitting down, resting, and thus the third decade became marked as a new \"set.\" In Tshagatai the word for thirty is \u0627\u0648\u0698\u0648\u0632 (\u00f3\u0142-tuz), and, as we would naturally expect, the Verb from which it is derived \u0627\u0648\u0698\u0648\u0631\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0642 (\u00f3\u0142-tur-maq) 'to sit, to remain.' Another instance of the same formation is \u0642\u0648\u062f\u0648\u0632 (q\u00fad-us) 'hydrophobia; mad, enraged, out of mind,'\nfrom \u0642\u062f\u0631\u0645\u06cc (qud-ur-maq) \u2018to get out of one\u2019s mind, to become mad or enraged.\u2019 It will have been noticed that in these formations the final r of the Verb is eliminated, and that the s of us and is takes its place. By the same process also \u0643\u0631 (g\u00f6z) \u2018the eye\u2019 is derived from the Verb \u0643\u0631\u0645\u06a9 (g\u00f6r-mek) \u2018to see.\u2019\n\n(40) \u062a\u0631\u0642\u06cc\u0642 (qir-q) forty. The only Verb to which this Numeral can be referred is \u062a\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0642 (qir-maq) \u2018to break.\u2019 Another pause having been reached on the ten fingers being counted for the fourth time, and the previous one having been called a \u201csitting\u201d or a \u201cset,\u201d this new stop is with no less appropriateness designated as a \u201cbreak.\u201d The termination \u064a\u0642 (iq or \u2019q), or in soft roots \u064a\u0643 (ik or \u2019k), is employed in forming past participles, adjectives of a passive and sometimes of an intransitive character, which are also frequently used as substantive, e.g. \u064a\u0627\u0631\u0642 (y\u0101r-ig) \u2018split, cracked; a split, a crack, a fissure,\u2019 from \u064a\u0627\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0642 (y\u0101r-maq) \u2018to split, to cleave;\u2019 \u064a\u0627\u062a\u0631\u0642 (y\u0101t-iq) \u2018lying, inclined, not standing erect; a large flask with narrow neck, a travelling bottle,\u2019 from \u064a\u0627\u062a\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0642 (y\u0101t-maq) \u2018to lie, lie down, rest horizontally.\u2019 So likewise \u062a\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0642 (qir-iq or qir\u2019q) means \u2018broken, broken off; a fracture, a fragment;\u2019 and it became the name for forty, because in reaching that number, the act of numeration met with another \u201cbreak,\u201d and the fourth decade constituted a new \u201cfragment\u201d or part, portion, of the numbers.\n\n(50) \u0627\u064a\u0644\u06cc (\u00e9l-li), better \u0627\u064a\u0644\u06cc (\u00e9l-i) fifty. What is now the usual orthography of this Numeral is plainly erroneous. As \u0627\u06a9\u06cc \u2018two,\u2019 is written \u0627\u06a9\u06cc, so also \u0627\u064a\u0644\u06cc \u2018fifty,\u2019 ought to be written \u0627\u064a\u0644\u06cc. Both these words are equally pronounced with only one consonant. The mistaken orthography may have been suggested to somebody by the desire graphically to distinguish this word from others, of which the pronunciation is different; and to others by a false etymology, deriving the Numeral from the Noun \u0627\u064a\u0644 (el) \u2018hand,\u2019 instead of perceiving that both the\n\n1 Compare Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. XIV. Part II. p. 148.\nNumeral and the Noun have their common origin in a Verb.\n\nThe Tartar-Turkish Dictionary is of the latter class. It makes another sporadic attempt at numeral etymology, the last, as far as I can see, by explaining (\u00e9-l-li) as meaning 'a hand of tens,' probably in the stead of a quint of tens, because the hand has five fingers. Vambery and Shaw also follow in this track, contrary to native pronunciation, the former by writing (\u00e9-l-lik) and the latter (il-lik) 'fifty,' adding the question in parenthesis: \"Is this Numeral connected with il-ik 'hand'?\" But what must at once raise a hesitation in the mind as to the correctness of this course, is the fact that this would be the only instance in the formation of Numerals by means of the termination (lik), shortened into (li); whereas the language in general shows a decided partiality for providing the forms of its Numerals in pairs, as e.g. \u00e1lt-i, yedi; s\u00e9k-iz, t\u00f3q-uz; all-mi\u0161, yedmi\u0161; s\u00e9k-an, t\u00f3q-an. Another such pair was the ancient \u0642\u064a\u0631\u0642 (qir-iq) 'forty,' and \u0627\u064a\u0644\u064a\u0643 (il-ik) 'fifty.' Dr. A. Castren, in his Koibal Grommar, p. 17, writes it quite correctly with one l, il-ik and il-ek; and Mirza A. Kasem Beg, in his Turkish Grammar, p. 54, though following the now customary faulty spelling in Turkish, yet in his Latin transliteration gives the correct form \u00e9-l-i. The state of the Turkish language itself, as it is still preserved to us in its various eastern dialects, and the nature of its grammatical laws, leave no doubt that, whether we recognize in the present form of the name for fifty the primitive termination (ik) or (lik), the Verb to which alone it must be traced as its source is \u0627\u064a\u0644\u0645\u0643 (il-mek), signifying 'to stretch out, stretch forth; to stretch to, attach, tack to; to tie, fasten, button; to close, to shut.' Vambery gives its meaning in Tshagatai only by 'to close, shut, tie, fasten;' and that of its derivative \u0627\u064a\u0644\u0645\u0643 (il-ik) by 'closed, shut, tied, fastened.' Shaw, in his eastern vocabulary, also assigns to the latter the meaning of \"hand\" (either from being stretched out, or closed, shut), and \"marrow\" (from being closed in and shut up within the bone), to which Bianchi adds that of \"buttonhole.\"\n(because it, as it were, closes in and shuts up the button, in tying or fastening a dress). This same word is also undoubtedly the original form of the Numeral \u0625\u0644\u0649 (\u00e9\u00e9l-i) which, in harmony with its four predecessors, expresses the idea that another counting of the ten fingers, the fifth decade, is \"closed.\" Thus the Numerals 40 and 50 were formed in one way, by the self-same suffix, which in the former case assumed the form \u064a\u0642 (iq), as attached to a hard root, and in the latter \u064a\u0643 (ik), as attached to a soft root. Such terminations and suffixes change in course of time, or are dropped altogether.\n\n\u0627\u06cc\u0644\u06cc\u06a9 (\u00e9\u00e9l-ik), when it meant fifty, shortened its termination into \u0649 (i), \u0627\u06cc\u0644\u06cc (il-i, \u00e9l-i); and when it signified \"hand,\" discarded it altogether \u0627\u06cc\u0644 or \u0627\u0644 (il, el). The instances are not rare in which now only \u0649 (i) is left of the primitive suffix \u064a\u0643 (ik), and the following are some of them: \u062f\u06cc\u0631\u06cc (dir-i), i.q. \u062f\u06cc\u0631\u06cc\u06a9 (dir-ik) and \u062a\u06cc\u0631\u06cc\u06a9 (tir-ik) 'living, alive;' \u062c\u0631\u06cc (g\u00e9r-i), 'militia-man, soldier;' i.q. \u062c\u0631\u06cc\u06a9 (g\u00e9r-ik) 'brave, dexterous;' \u0627\u06cc\u062a\u06cc\u06a9 (it-i), i.q. \u0627\u06cc\u062a\u06cc\u06a9 (it-ik) 'sharp, pointed, quick, agile.'\n\n(60 and 70) \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0645\u06cc\u0634 (\u00e1lt-mi\u0161) sixty; \u064a\u062f\u0645\u06cc\u0634 (y\u00e9d-mi\u0161) seventy.\n\nWith this couple of names, for the sixth and seventh Ten of numbers, the language has recourse to the correspondent Units. In fabricating new appellations for the end of decades and for the pauses occasioned thereby, the resources were practically exhausted when the first Ten had been called an \"Aside,\" a leaving on one \"side,\" so as to make a fresh start in a new direction; the second a \"Twice arriving,\" viz. at the end of the ten fingers; the third a \"Sitting down, set, rest;\" the fourth a \"Break,\" and the fifth a \"Close.\" At this point and not before, the creative imagination of the pristine Turks turns for aid to the Units. But even now it does not yet condescend to the mode of other nations, by mechanically combining a Unit and a Ten, but makes another desperate attempt, before consenting to that last step. It ingeniously converts the sixth and seventh Units into Verbs, and gives them the characteristic of the past participle, by appending to them the syllable \u0645\u06cc\u0634 (mi\u0161). \u064a\u062f\u0645\u06cc\u0634 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0645\u06cc\u0634 (\u00e1lt-mi\u0161) and \u064a\u062f\u0645\u06cc\u0634 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0645\u06cc\u0634 (y\u00e9d-mi\u0161)\nmean respectively: 'having sired,' 'having serened,' that is, having performed for the sixth and seventh time the act of numeration within its natural compass, as indicated by the fingers of both hands. Thus once more a couple of Tens has been provided with intelligible names, and yet the bodily introduction of \u0627\u0648\u0646 (on) 'ten,' dexterously avoided.\n\n(80 and 90) \u0633\u06a9\u0633\u0627\u0646 (s\u00e9k-s\u00e1n) eighty; \u0637\u0642\u0633\u0627\u0646 or \u0637\u0648\u0642\u0633\u0627\u0646 (t\u00f3q-s\u00e1n) ninety. Now, in this last pair of Numerals, the creative ingenuity seems finally conquered; it can no longer avoid the long-deferred \u0627\u0648\u0646 (on). But there is yet one means left of covering the defeat, and the language would not be Turkish, if it did not avail itself of this last alternative. A compromise is formed between the Unit and the Ten, by which each has to yield something: the former has its final consonant changed, the latter its vowel, and thus the transaction issues into daylight under the disguise of a \u0633\u06a9\u0633\u0627\u0646 (s\u00e9k-s\u00e1n) for \u0633\u06a9\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0648\u0646 (s\u00e9k-ir on), and a \u0637\u0642\u0633\u0627\u0646 (t\u00f3q-s\u00e1n) for \u0637\u0642\u0648\u0632 \u0627\u0648\u0646 (t\u00f3quz on).\n\n(100) \u064a\u0648\u0632 (y\u00fcz) hundred. This same word is also still used with the signification of 'face, surface, front, farther side, onward direction.' A Verb is formed from it (\u064a\u0648\u0632 \u0645\u06a9) yitz-mek) which means 'to swim (i.e. to float or move on the \"surface\"); to skin, to flay (i.e. to take off the \"surface\" or skin.)' It is obvious, therefore, that \u064a\u0648\u0632 (y\u00fcz) was chosen as a name for \"hundred,\" because this Numeral was considered as the uppermost, or as being upon the face and surface of all the rest. At the time this name was chosen, \"hundred\" was probably the highest number beyond which the Turks did not count; and \u0628\u06cc\u062a (biit) 'a thousand,' may have been superadded at a later period. In analogy with the formation of \u0643\u0648\u0632 (g\u00f6z) 'the eye,' from \u0643\u0631\u0645\u06a9 (g\u00f6r-mek), 'to see;' of \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u0632 (iz) 'track, trace,' from \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0645\u06a9 (ir-mag), 'to go;' and of \u0633\u06cc\u0632 (s\u00e9m-iz) 'fat,' from \u0633\u06cc\u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0645\u06a9 (s\u00e9m-ir-mek), 'to grow fat;' the Verb from which \u064a\u0648\u0632 (y\u00fcz) was derived must have been \u064a\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06a9 (y\u00fcr-mek). In the Osmanli dialect this Verb is no longer used, but has been superseded by \u064a\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06a9 (y\u00fcr-\u00fc-mek) 'to walk, go, travel;' in Shaw's vocabulary of the eastern Turkish, however, we still find\n(y\u00fcr-mek) \u2018to walk, to progress, to proceed\u2019 (e.g. alga minip y\u00fcrmek \u2018to proceed on horseback\u2019). This Verb fully accounts for the meaning of \u064a\u064f\u0632 (y\u00fcz) \u2018face, hundred\u2019 as of something foremost, uppermost. By the same association of ideas the eastern Turkish \u0645\u0627\u0646\u06a9\u0644\u06cc (m\u0101n-lai), signifying \u2018forehead,\u2019 comes from the Verb \u0645\u0627\u0646\u06a9\u0645\u0627\u0642 (m\u0101n-may) \u2018to walk, go, advance, progress, proceed.\u2019 This view of the connexion between \u2018hundred,\u2019 as the face- or front-number, and \u2018face,\u2019 and between face and the verbal notion of proceeding, advancing, fronting, is certainly much more natural and simple than another, which might likewise present itself to one\u2019s mind, and which might be attached to the meaning of the English word gang in e.g. \u201ca gang of thieves,\u201d so that \u064a\u064f\u0632 (y\u00fcz) \u2018hundred,\u2019 from \u064a\u064f\u0631\u06cc\u0645\u06a9 (y\u00fcr-i-mek) \u2018to walk, to go,\u2019 would be regarded as originally indicating indefinitely any great number, e.g. of warriors going together to battle, or of cattle going together to pasture, and as only gradually restricted in its use to the definite number \u201chundred.\u201d But though this is not altogether impossible, and I myself made the suggestion many years ago, the former view is preferable.\n\n(1000) \u0628\u0652\u062b (b\u012bn) thousand. This last of Turkish Numerals undoubtedly comes from the Verb \u0628\u0652\u0646\u06cc\u0645\u06a9 (bin-mek) \u2018to mount, to ride,\u2019 because it surmounts all the other numbers and has them under it, like a rider his horse. In the Numeral the n of the Verb is changed into \u012b from euphonic reasons, as is also the case in the Substantive \u0628\u0652\u062b (be\u012bn), which was originally identical with the Numeral and signifies \u2018a spot, mole, freckle,\u2019 evidently because these things appear in the face or sit on the surface of the skin. In the eastern Turkish dialects the Numeral and the Substantive are still wholly identical in every respect, and need not be treated as two words, as is now done in the dictionaries, for they are really only one. This whole view acquires the strongest confirmation by a reference to the words under consideration in Mr. Shaw\u2019s eastern vocabulary, where it has only to be remembered that the initial m stands for the b of the west, and the three words are thus given: \u0645\u06cc\u0646\u06a9 (mi\u1e45) num. \u2018a thousand;\u2019 \u0645\u06cc\u0646\u06a9 (mi\u1e45) subs. \u2018a beauty-spot,\na mole on the face;' \u0645\u06cc\u0628\u0645\u0627\u06a9 (min-mak) v.tr. 'to mount a horse, to ride.'\n\nThe attempt has now been made, and for the first time successfully carried through, of tracing all the Turkish Numerals to their roots and primary signification. Prof. Bopp's opinion, that not any language has produced original words for the designation of the peculiar ideas three, four, five, etc., has been fully confirmed, as far as the Turkish is concerned; for we have found that all the present Numerals had originally definite other meanings, and were afterwards only applied and adapted to represent numbers. But the other part of his assertion, that \"the appellations of numbers resist all comparison with verbal bases,\" has been triumphantly disproved, as wholly inconsistent with the Turkish. Whatever may be said about the obscurity of the Sanscritic and Shemitic Numerals, those of the Tartar languages are perfectly transparent, as to their etymology and original meaning. The key which I have brought from Africa to the solution of the difficulty did not fail us in a single instance. It has enabled us to cast a slight glance into the early laboratory of language, and to witness a little of the process by which an unfettered imagination called into existence new words, or used old ones with a new meaning, and thus opened the door for a difference of pronunciation and change of form. The success thus obtained, as regards the Turkish Numerals\u2014a success which hardly admits of doubt, in even a single instance\u2014may also prove helpful in other directions, where obscurity and uncertainty have not yet yielded to the assuring light of knowledge.\nART. IX.\u2014Grammatical Note and Vocabulary of the Language of the Kor-k\u016b, a Kolarian tribe in Central India. Communicated by the Honorary Secretary, Mr. R. N. Cusir.\n\nAfter the meeting of the Society on the 21st of Jan. 1884, to discuss the subject of the origin of the Indian alphabet, brought forward by me, a printed Missionary pamphlet and a lithographed Vocabulary of the Language of the Kor-k\u016b, were found in the Rooms of the Society, left intentionally or by accident by some unrecognized visitor. From internal evidence they appear both to have been composed by Mr. Albert Norton, an American Missionary, working among the tribe at Ellichp\u016br. It appears to be a proper compliment to him to insert the Vocabulary and Grammatical Note in our Journal, as they are genuine, entirely new material, and a contribution to our knowledge.\n\nIn my \"Sketch of the Modern Languages of the East Indies\" (1878), I remarked as follows:\n\n\"The Kur or Kur-ku dwell in the Central Provinces on the Mahad\u00e9o Hills, and Westward in the Forests on the Rivers Tapti and Narbada, up to the Bhil Country. On the Mahad\u00e9o Hills they prefer to be called Muasi. They are Pagans, and, though residing amidst the Gond (who are Dravidian), their Language is Kolarian. Vocabularies are supplied by Hislop and Dalton. They are wholly illiterate. In the Districts of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d and Bet\u00fal their number exceeds fifty-nine thousand.\"\n\nThe name of the tribe is another instance of the Egotistical character of Savage tribes, of which we have so many instances in Asia and Africa. The word 'Koro' in their Language means 'Man,' with the Plural Suffix Kor-k\u016b means 'Men'\u2014the men, par eminence. The Grammatical construction has a strong affinity to the Sontal, and there is ample evidence of their belonging to one Family. There are many Loan-words in the Vocabulary.\nVOCABULARY\u2014ENGLISH-KOR.\n\nabide c., p. imp. t\u0101r\u016b or t\u0101r\u0113, p. \nind. t\u0101r\u016bb\u0101 or per\u0101k\u016bb\u0101, past \nind. t\u0101ren or per\u0101ken, b\u0101ng \nt\u0101r.\n\nable v. yaten.\n\nabout (Hind. p\u0101s) pr. meran.\n\nabove pr. len.\n\nadvantage n. f\u0101da.\n\nafterwards ad. taute (F.).\n\nall s. sah\u012bl.\n\nalone ad. ckla.\n\nalways ad.

Perhaps they represent different persons.\n\n2. Great need of noticing closely the forms of the letters. e must always be distinguished from \u0113. tarpaik\u0113 means 'thrown away,' tarpaik\u0113 is the imperative 'throw away.'\n\n3. The past form of the verb is sometimes used as a past participle. Ex.: s\u0101le 'have brought' or 'having brought.'\n\n4. \u016b and o are interchangeable in many words. Ex.: Kork\u016b sometimes say j\u016bm\u0113, and at other times jom\u0113 for the present imperative 'eat.'\n\n5. Kork\u016b postpositions. (1) len 'above, on, over.' Ex.: 'on the mountain' bala len. (2) tawen or to,en 'after, behind.' Ex.: 'come after me' inya tawen hej\u0113. (3) s\u016btiken 'before, in front of.' Ex.: 'go before' s\u016btiken bo. (4) tin or tan 'for, for the sake of.' Ex.: 'he works for you' d\u012b am\u0101tin k\u0101maib\u0101. (5) en or n 'in, within.' Ex.: 'there are ten houses in the village' gaoen gel \u016br\u0101ko t\u012bky\u0113, 'he is in the house' d\u012b \u016br\u0101n ka. (6) ten 'from.' Ex.: 'from where have you come?' tonganten yi,en. (7) ke or ken 'to.' Ex.: 'give the money to me' i\u1e45ke dam\u0101 il\u0113. (8) meran 'near, about.' Ex.: i\u1e45ye meran hej\u0113 'come near me.'\n\n6. The possessive termination ye or ya is used like the Hind. terminations k\u0101, ki, ke, before some postpositions. Ex.: i\u1e45ye meran 'near me.'\n\nWe have been able to discern only four forms of the verb:\n\n1. The present indicative, which form is used also for the future ind. Ex.: in hegib\u0101 'I am coming' or 'I will come.'\n\n2. The present imperative. Ex.: am shene 'go.'\n\n3. The present indicative with a negative. Ex.: in hingan b\u0101ng tar 'I do not dwell here.'\n\n4. The past indicative. Ex.: d\u012b yi,en 'he has come.' We have not inserted in the vocabulary the form of the negative present ind., except with the verb t\u0101rb\u0101. It appears to be formed regularly by joining the negative to the root of the verb. The past ind. seems to be used for both the perfect and imperfect tenses. We have\nnot been able to discover the variations of the verb in the different persons and genders.\n\nNouns form their plurals by adding the termination -ko to the singular. Ex.: dob\u0101 'bullock,' dob\u0101ko 'bullocks.' The word for 'man' is koro, for 'men' it is kork\u016b; the final o of koro is rejected, and k\u016b added instead of ko. Many nouns are adopted from Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b, Hindi, and Hind\u016bst\u0101n\u012b, by adding the vowel o to the adopted word. Ex.: the Hind\u016bst\u0101n\u012b word for 'box' is sand\u016bk, the Kor-k\u016b say sand\u016bko. But the Kor-k\u016b adopt some words without making any change in them. Ex.: in Hind\u016bst\u0101n\u012b tamb\u016b and raut\u012b mean 'a tent,' and they are used without any variation in Kor. In adding the o to adopted nouns the usage is not uniform.\nART. X.\u2014The Pariah Caste in Travancore. By S. Mater, Nevandrum, Travancore, South India.\n\nThe Pariahs or Parayans (feminine in Tamil Parachi, in Malayalam Parayi) number 63,688, and are more numerous in the South of Travancore, though a few are found in almost every Talook (county). Of the whole, only 192 males, and no females, can read. Their general social condition is very similar to that of the other so-called \"slave castes,\" though, perhaps, not quite so low.\n\nThere are said to be thirteen branches of this caste, somewhat varying in status and in the estimation in which they are held. Like various other castes, they delight to expatiate on some traditionary pretensions to a former free and elevated position, which the more intelligent endeavour to support by curious childish reasonings and fanciful deductions. A native friend, who is very familiar with their views, has favoured me with a sketch of their arguments on this point, of which the following slight abstract is presented. It will be observed that they assume the truth of the Brahmanical explanation of the origin of the present low castes, which is to the effect that they are the offspring of forbidden unions between persons of differing castes. All such instances reported by tradition, or mentioned in sacred poems or Puranas, are supposed to be instances of Pariahs, who thus can be proved to have been kings, prophets, saints, and even gods! The argument is founded on baseless myths and poems rather than on history, ethnology, and comparative philology. And the whole applies rather to the Tamil Pariahs than to the Malayalam ones.\n\nOrigin of Pariahs.\n\nOne born of a Brahman female by a Sudra was called Chand\u0101lan or Parayan. In South India the classification of \"right-hand\" and \"left-hand\" castes is ancient, and the\nmutual disputes between these long continued. There is no open quarrelling at present, but their mutual enmity has not quite ceased. Besides Pariahs, who headed the quarrel, the right-hand castes are Vell\u00e1lars, Sh\u00e1nars, N\u00e1yakkars, etc.; the left-hand castes are Carpenters, Maravars, Pallars, Chakki-lairs, etc. The Brahmans joined neither party, but fomented the discord.\n\nSundry Pariahs have reigned in ancient times, as Nanthen, King of Bahar, son of a Sudra maid-servant; Kooken, the friend of Rama Rajah in the Ramayana; Athikamen, born of a Pariah woman, and brought up by Cheram\u00e1n. Harichandra Rajah, the great-grandfather of Rama, was brought up by a Pariah, as stated in the drama. King Veerakum\u00e1ran and his mother were supported by a Pariah, and his kingdom strengthened by a thousand of them.\n\nGurus also. Vadishtan, teacher of Rama, was born of a dancing-woman by Brahma; and is said to have married a Pariah woman, who, in consequence of her chastity, became, on her death, a star in the zodiac.\n\nThe Sh\u00e1n\u00e1r race are descended from Adi, the daughter of a Pariah woman at Karuvur, who taught them to climb the palm-tree, and prepared a medicine by which they should be protected from falling from the high trees. The squirrels also ate some of this, by which they enjoy a similar immunity.\n\nUppei was the daughter of this Adi, and married a Parayan Vediya: after her death she became Mariamman, the goddess of small-pox, and is worshipped in every village. Her younger sister, Valli, became the wife of the second son of Siva, and is worshipped in every Saivite pagoda as equal to Supramanian. Isakki was a Pariah woman, whose pagodas in Tinnevelly and South Travancore are numerous: the Hindus fear him more than they do their own Triad. Oaths are taken at her shrines.\n\nSiva is said to have had two children by a Parachi, in honour of the elder of whom, Aneiy\u00e9rum perum parayan\u2014\"the great Parayan who rides on the elephant\"\u2014annual festivals are conducted at Tiruv\u00e1rvur.\nIn many Hindi temples there is also an altar called M\u00e1dan munnadi, dedicated to Chambanaya Parayan, on which sacrifice is offered before the worship of the chief gods is begun. Also, before securing the ropes to idol cars for drawing them, a lamb is sacrificed to T\u00e9radi M\u00e1dan according to the proverb \"Before the god, the ch\u00e1mbian or pariah; before the Sh\u00e1st\u00e1vu, the munnadi.\"\n\nAll this, however, we may remark, might naturally arise from the desire to propitiate the Pariah demons, as easily as from any original authority or influence exercised by this caste.\n\nThe origin of the Serpent Worship at Nagercoil is attributed to a Pariah woman, who was at work in a rice field on the spot, when she saw a divine serpent expanding its hood: a pagoda was erected, and on account of this, certain Pariahs in the vicinity enjoy grants from the Native Government.\n\nTiruvallavar, the author of the Tamil Kural, and Avvei, the authoress of various other poems, are reputed to have been Pariahs.\n\nSomewhat more to the point, whatever be their origin, are the curious and anomalous privileges of the servile castes in a few places, which Mr. Walhouse regards as surviving vestiges of ancient power exercised by them, and of a higher position as masters of the land before the arrival of the Brahmanical races. At Melkotta, for instance, and Bailur, the Holiars have the right of entrance to the temple on three days of the year specially set apart for them. At the Dindigul \"bull games,\" the Kallars alone can officiate as priests and consult the deity. At Tiruvalur, the headman of the Pariahs is mounted on an elephant with the god and carries a chauri. At the annual festival of the goddess of Blacktown in Madras, when the t\u00e1l\u00ed (marriage-badge) is tied round the neck of the goddess in the name of the entire community, a Pariah represents the bridegroom.\n\nThe following points of similarity or connexion between the Parayans and the Brahmans have been traced by the former.\n1. The Pariahs occasionally used the sacred thread; a few of their priests (Valluvars) wear it constantly. At funerals it is used; and on the occasion of marriages both bride and bridegroom wear the cord for sixteen days, then leave it off. But is not this mere imitation of a fashionable custom?\n\n2. When there is a marriage in a Brahman house, the master is obliged to offer to the Pariah a new cloth, cocoanut, rice, plantains, and vegetables: these are taken to the back yard and the Brahman shouts thrice towards the Pariah village, \"Brother, the wedding is about to be completed.\" The marriage cloth and badge are also taken there, but brought back again.\n\nBut are not these mere acts of condescension and charity to the poor on a festive occasion?\n\n3. The white cloth umbrella, the handle of which is a bambu with twenty-one joints, and the white flag which Brahmans only are privileged to use, are claimed and used by Pariahs as their right on marriage and funeral occasions. The proverb is, \"A white umbrella for the Brahman and the Sambuvan.\"\n\n4. At certain sacrifices Brahmans used to be obliged to eat the flesh of the cow, which only Pariahs besides will touch. Of late years, mutton, or a figure of dough, has been substituted for this.\n\n5. If an aged Pariah die, his wife is carried part of the way to the funeral, as if to be burned with her husband's corpse.\n\n6. There is a legend to the effect that in ancient times, before the institution of caste, two sisters going weary and hungry along a road came upon a dead bullock: the elder sister very sensibly cut out a steak and ate it, which the younger refused to share. The descendants of the elder became Pariahs, those of the younger Brahmans, whence the proverb, \"The Brahman's elder is the Parayan.\"\n\n7. Brahmans and Pulayars have no special washermen. (No one will condescend to wash for degraded Pulayars.)\n\n8. Brahmans and Pariahs call their dwellings kottil, and use the term nangeinatti for the husband's sister, which no\nother castes do. Eastern Brahmins and Parachis at funerals wear the cloth in exactly the same way.\n\nWhatever be the practical value of the preceding speculations, and they seem not to be worth much, it is certain that the actual condition of the Pariahs in Travancore was and still is lamentably low. They were formerly bought and sold like cattle, starved, flogged \"like buffaloes,\" made to work all day for a little rice, and kept at a distance as polluted; and they still are in a position of subservience and deep degradation, not vitally differing from that of the Pulayars and Vedars. Rarely possessed of any property but a small clearing, to which their rights have never been legally secured, they are employed principally in field labour, with wretched dress, dwellings, and food, no manufactures of any value, suffering from ignorance and evil habits of drunkenness and vice, and devoted to demonism and sorcery.\n\nOne peculiar characteristic of this caste, and most offensive to others, is that they eat the flesh of bullocks and cows left dead by the roadside. They cut it up and bear it away; what they leave the vultures and dogs devour. This disgusting practice is discouraged, and is to a great extent disappearing among the Christian converts from that caste.\n\nBeginning with those in the centre of Travancore, we shall afterwards speak of the Pariahs of N\u00e1njin\u00e1d in the south, and lastly of those of the Vemban\u00e1d and North Travancore.\n\nThe Pariahs of Nevandrum district are rather stout, fair in complexion, and comparatively bold. They live in clusters of huts, and eat the putrid flesh of dead cattle, tigers, and other animals. Their girls are married when very young for mere form by their cousins, but when grown up, are selected by others, who give them a cloth and live with them in concubinage. Cases of polygamy occur, and sometimes also of polyandry.\n\nThe females are rather fair in complexion and licentious in habits. They wear numerous heavy ornaments, generally two iron bracelets and two heavy and several lighter brass\nones on the arms, copper rings for the fingers, and for the ears several leaden rings with a flat circular brass piece, the size of a rupee, pendent from the upper part. Their necks are burdened with a multiplicity of bead necklaces. They rub turmeric over their faces and bodies and cloths. They have no washermen, and are not accustomed to wear white cloths or to bathe regularly. From their filthy habits, therefore, the stench of a crowd is almost insufferable.\n\nThese people are often dishonest, brutish, and drunken, very offensive and abusive in their behaviour towards the higher castes, for which they are objects of reproach and dislike, these classes forgetting too often that this moral degradation has been caused by the long-continued oppression, ignorance and contempt to which they have been exposed.\n\nThey eat the seed of the Melocanna Rheedii, which abounds in an unusually dry season, as does also the bambu. Jungle roots, land crabs, and snails form part of their food. Some of them have enough of rice at harvest time, but seldom at any other period of the year. Their domestic relations are very loose and unsatisfactory, husband and wife too readily separating for slight causes, and forming new connexions even after several children have been born.\n\nThe Pariahs are zealous devil-worshippers, their chief demons being M\u00e1dan (the cow one), Rathach\u00e1mandy Mallan (the giant) and M\u00favaratta Mallan, Karunk\u00e1li (black K\u00e1li), Ch\u00e1vus (departed spirits) Bh\u00fatham, Mantram\u00fartti, and other Murttis (ghosts), with many other evil beings, to whom groves and altars are dedicated.\n\nThe souls of their deceased ancestors are called Marutt\u00e1 (ghosts), for whose worship young cocoa-leaves are tied at the bottom of a tree, and a small shed erected on poles and decorated with garlands of flowers; presents of cocoa-nuts, parched rice, and arrack are offered, and cocks killed in sacrifice. In the devil dancing they use clubs and rattans, bells, handkerchiefs, and cloths dedicated to these deities.\n\nOther castes generally dread incurring the displeasure and malice of these deities. Sudras and Shanars frequently employ the Pariah devil dancers and sorcerers to exorcise\ndemons, search for and dig out magical charms buried in the earth by enemies, and counteract their enchantments; and, in case of sickness, send for them to beat the drum and so discover what demon has caused the affliction and what is to be done to remove it. Sometimes a present of a cow is given for these services.\n\nThese pretended sorcerers are slightly acquainted with a few medicines, profess to cure snake bite, and can repeat some tales of the Hindu gods. They also profess to discover thieves, who sometimes, indeed, through fear actually take ill, confess, and restore the property.\n\nOne priest whom I knew used to pretend that he had a \"bird devil\" in his possession, by which he could cast out other devils. On one occasion, however, when he made the attempt in the presence of a large concourse of Sudras and others, he utterly failed, and hurt himself severely by beating his chest with a cocoa-nut and leaping into the fire. He soon after resolved to abandon this vile course of life, and became a Christian.\n\nEven after commencing attendance on Christian worship, they are easily alarmed by the occurrence of sickness, which is attributed by their relatives remaining in heathenism to the attacks of the demons whom they have deserted.\n\nIn one place the people of a whole village were hindered from Christianity, to which they are well disposed, and where some have at times joined us, by a peculiar endowment they enjoy, on the ground and condition of their influence and intercession with the demons. The story runs that some three centuries ago the Sudras of the locality joined together for some cause to beat a Parayan to death. Shortly after, many of the assailants died, and it was supposed by the astrologers that the demon P\u00e1ra M\u00e1dan, worshipped by the murdered Parayan, was the cause of their suffering. To appease his anger, the diviners recommended the Sudras to make a collection of money, grain, fowls, and other offerings, which was handed over to the Pariah devil dancers. The sacred grove of this demon lay near the houses of certain Brahmins, who next began to suffer, and who then endowed\nthe grove with certain lands and rice fields for the service of\nthe demon. The Pariahs still possess the lands, and make\nannual offerings in March. They are afraid that if they\nbecome Christians, the whole will be taken from them.\n\nMarriage.\n\nThe usual age is fourteen for boys, and seven for girls.\nHaving selected a girl, the bridegroom sends to her a cloth,\na fanam, and two finger-rings. This is called the \"advance\"\nor \"earnest cloth.\" Henceforward the man ought to pay for\nher food and cloth at new moons and Onam feasts. Then\nthe bride's father and uncle unite to give a feast. Early in\nFebruary a person from the husband's party comes to the\ngirl's house to settle that the marriage should be performed\nat this harvest. On the next day both parties boil some rice,\nwhich is called \"muh\u016brtta nel\"\u2014\"rice for the propitious\nhour\"\u2014fixed for the marriage, which will be, say, a\nWednesday or Thursday of the month of Meenam (middle\nof March to the middle of April).\n\nAll friends should be invited, and each render what help\nhe can to the feast. The wedding takes place in a pandal at\nthe bride's house, erected by their headman, for which he is\nrewarded with a double mat, a double basket of boiled rice, a\nn\u00e1li measure of prepared areca nut, a bundle of tobacco, and\none of betel-leaves, and three measures of aval (flattened\nrice) on the conclusion of the ceremony. On the appointed\nday, the bridegroom comes to the bride's house fully pre-\npared, and sits in the pandal, where a pot filled with water,\na n\u00e1li measure of paddy, a lamp, and a flat brass plate, with a\ncloth and betel-leaves, are placed.\n\nWhen the auspicious hour has arrived, the bride's uncle\ncovers her face with the cloth which had lain on the plate,\nleads her three times around the shed, and then sets her near\nthe bridegroom and towards the east. Then his sister and\nher sister take her, along with the measure of rice and the\nlamp, and go round the shed three times: the bride then\ncovers her face with the nine betel-leaves, and sits looking\ntowards the east. The bridegroom then tie the tali. The headman now breaks a cocoa-nut (which is called the Gana-pathi polivu) to augur the future of the pair. The bride's uncle delivers her to the husband's elder brother, who takes her from the shed and sets her in another room.\n\nAfter the feast, the husband and wife go to their house together with their relatives. They have a feast there too. In the morning, the husband gives ten fanams to the bride's father, and fourteen fanams (two rupees) to her uncle. Should the couple live together till the death of the husband, the wife will receive one-half of her husband's property. Should they separate, the uncle returns to the husband the fourteen fanams which he had at first received, which he will pay to some other uncle to give him a niece as wife.\n\nAfter the wife's confinement, the husband is starved for seven days, eating no cooked rice or other food, only roots and fruits; and drinking only arrack or toddy. The shed in which she was confined is burnt down. All this is dropped by the Christian converts.\n\nDeath and Burial.\n\nIn case of sickness, the diviner is first consulted as to its cause, as is done amongst other similar castes: he names a demon, and offerings are demanded of rice, fruits, flowers, and fowls. Being duly supplied with these articles, the diviner spreads cow-dung thinly over a small space in the yard, where he places the offerings on three plantain-leaves, invokes the presence of the demons, dances, and repeats mantras, looking towards the east. He catches the demon that is supposed to come in an old piece of cloth filled with flowers and parched rice, and carries both demon and offerings into the jungle, where again preparing a spot as before, two torches are set, the food arranged, and after further mantras a fowl is sacrificed. He takes the whole afterwards for himself, gets a good meal, and is also paid twelve chuckrams (small silver coins) for the service.\n\nHere it is interesting to note that among the Samoans a\nsheet is spread out to obtain the soul of one deceased without burial, but some visible object is expected. The first living thing that happens to light upon the sheet is supposed to be the spirit, is carefully wrapped up, and the bundle buried with all due ceremony. (Turner's Polynesia, p. 233.)\n\nCases of death are at once reported to the relatives and caste men, who assemble and bathe the corpse, males for a man, females for a woman. Purchasing two new cloths, they tie one round the head, the other round the waist, remove the body to the open floor or verandah, and lay it north and south. The children and nephews then put the usual raw rice and scraped cocoa-nut into the mouth, wrap it in mats and carry it for burial. The diviner gives directions for the digging of the grave, which looks north and south. The body is carried round three times, mantras are repeated, and it is lowered in: the relatives first, then all present, throw in handfuls of earth and fill up the grave. On it are placed a tender cocoa-nut at the head, and a plant of turmeric and another of the esculent arum (m\u00e1ran) at the foot. All present are served with betel. The people of the house fast on that day, next day take raw rice, conjee, and young cocoa-nuts, and for sixteen days mourn and weep for the departed.\n\nOn the seventh day, all meet again at the house and purify it with cowdung. Each is presented with a little tobacco and two betel-nuts, and pays two chuckrams to the head of the house. A day is appointed for the pulakuli or purification from pollution, which is done within thirty days after the decease: then all attend and are fed with rice.\n\nIn case of small-pox, one who has had this disease is called in to attend; he takes the patient to a temporary hut in a lonely place, and is well paid and supplied with all that he requires. Through fear, none of the relatives will go near. Should the patient die, the attendant buries him on the spot, performing the ceremonies himself, then comes to the house, repeats mantras, and waves his hands round the head of each to remove further alarm. If a woman with child dies, she is buried at a great distance away. Occasionally the remains\nof an aged man are burnt on a funeral pile, as being more honourable than burial, and providing some merit to the soul.\n\nThe Pariahs spend much of their hire, received in grain, on these ceremonies and on the purchase of arrack and toddy and fowls, which they present as offerings, and afterwards eat and drink.\n\nOne of our Christian converts who had been a devil-dancer being asked concerning his former practices, replied, that they were mere tricks to obtain money. Others have said that something came over them which they could not explain.\n\nLet us pay a visit to one of the rural hamlets of the K\u00f3lam Parayans, a considerable subdivision of this caste. It is situated, as required by Travancore caste law, at some distance from the road, so that one might pass by it for years without noticing its existence. In obscurity is their safety. Brahman agr\u00e1rams or streets are also far retired, but from the opposite cause. The Pariah village is situated at the head of a valley, and on the border of the rice-fields where they labour. The site is unhealthy, low and damp, surrounded by cocoa-nut palms and plantain-trees, the ground covered with decaying vegetable matter, and the drippings of cattle actually trickling into their spring and well. Did they but settle on the hill above, in view of the beautiful scenery, and fanned by the fresh breezes, longer life would be enjoyed.\n\nThe houses are small and dirty, but not quite so bad as those of the Pulayars, the walls being of mud and the roof thatched with jungle-grass. They stand close to one another, and are supplied with cowsheds and a few cattle. Two or three sheds for drying and thrashing grain are larger and more airy.\n\nThe younger women generally flee from the presence of a stranger. Those whom we see are covered with numerous brass rings, red beads, and other ornaments. The complexion is rather fair, sometimes a nice light red colour. There are occasional marked exceptions in fairness of skin,\nperhaps arising from some admixture of Mussalman or other blood, as Pariahs are not avoided to the same extent as Pulayars are. Some of the children are pretty, with pleasant brown eyes.\n\nThe men are in wretched filthy cloths. There is much suffering from sickness, the dirt of the houses produces vermin and itch, which deprives them of rest by day and sleep at night. A respectable native must cover his nostrils with his cloth when he enters amongst them, for the stench and filth. The aged, if there are any, suffer from debility, and may lie helpless day after day until they die; infants suffer from sores, diarrhoea, worms, and want of food; and adults from headache and indigestion, ague, dysentery, and intermittent fever. Much of the disease arises from starvation and lack of nutritive food; but instead of saving and careful habits and industry, they turn to drink, which is but a poor remedy for their sorrows.\n\nThe cattle manure is partly saved, but handed over to the Sudra farmers. The Pariahs plant a few trees around their settlement as \"otti (mortgage) and kurik\u00e1nam (a kind of tenant-right),\" then pay a sum to the Sudra landowner to permit them to enjoy the produce, as it is so difficult for them to get waste lands registered in their own name. Some have cleared lands and possess a few cocoa-nut and betel-nut palms, mangoes, etc., part of the fruit of which they sell and use the remainder. They may have a few cattle also, and let out a milch cow to the shepherds at one rupee per month. They grow some vegetables, tapioca, etc., in waste valley lands temporarily cleared and cultivated. They work in the rice fields, sowing, planting, and reaping, for which they are paid in paddy at about the same rate as other castes\u2014say seven edungallies of unhulled rice for reaping one para of land (about an eighth or tenth of an acre), and earn with diligence and care now-a-days as much at each harvest, twice in the year, as supplies them for a month or two without further purchase.\n\nDuring the slack season they work at making mats of Melocanna Rheedii, for which the men bring loads of the\nreeds from the hills, and the women do the more laborious work of plaiting. Baskets are made, worth one chuckram each, of which they manage to make sometimes three a day, \"working day and night,\" and coarse mats, which are sold at four for a fanam at the nearest market, or three at Travandrum or Kaliakavilei. This art they are said to have learnt from the Kanikar hill men within the last fifty years.\n\nA man needs cloths twice a year, the suit costing one rupee each time. The wife sometimes sports a good red cloth of Madura make, which costs three rupees, and lasts for special occasions, with care, several years.\n\nTheir property, if they have any, goes half to sons, half to nephews.\n\nIn another village familiar to me, the P\u00e1riahs live along the side of a narrow and deep glen, in the bottom of which their forefathers, four generations ago, cleared a small rice field, on the produce of which, along with their labour for the Sudras, they live. They manure the fields pretty well with the droppings of the oxen and buffaloes, and reap about ten times the seed sown. The sirkar tax is one-tenth of the produce, but on one piece the rate is four times the quantity of seed sown. Along the banks are planted a little coffee, which they sell, areca palms, mangoes, and pepper vines. The huts are very small and poor, and the spring of water polluted with manure and mud, cocoa-nut husk and rubbish; so there are no old men amongst them, no tall well-grown men, and no good-looking persons, as in some parts. They die at a comparatively early age of fever, cholera, and other diseases. And their masters have for years fiercely persecuted, in this out-of-the-way corner, those of them who became Christians, and have tried to deprive them of the spots of earth on which they live, lest their own power to oppress and make gain of the unfortunate Pariahs should be gone.\n\nNow a few notes on the Pariahs of N\u00e1njin\u00e1d, in the extreme south, near Cape Comorin. Four of the subdivisions of the caste are found there, and extend thence as far as Kulitory. From their geographical position and the comparative readiness with which they could escape to either\nside from oppression, the high castes have been less able to degrade them than in the more northern regions. They go somewhat freely to Sudra houses, and into various streets where other people go, but not into Brahman streets. They enjoy pretty free intercourse with Sudras and other medium castes, unlike the western Pariahs, who are called Teend\u00e1r Parayans 'not to be touched,' and cannot associate with their masters.\n\nSome Pariahs in Nanjinad have enjoyed ancestral property for six generations, and a few still have good properties. An instance has been known of a Sudra writer employed by a Pariah landowner.\n\nTitles were purchased for money of the Rajahs of Travancore, e.g. S\u00e1mbavan, an old name for Pandi Pariahs. The Rajah gave to such a headman a cane and authority to claim a double allowance of betel, etc. He, however, had in his turn to give double at funerals and festivals to his visitors. This head Parayan would be met with drums and marks of honour by his people, and the arrangement would enable the government to rule the Pariahs more easily. It is said that some Rajah fleeing in war hid himself in Pariah huts at Changankadei, and was thereby saved, for which he gave them a small grant of land producing a few fanams annually, which they still enjoy. They have a tradition that in m.e. 102 (A.D. 927) some Vanji Mannan Rajah granted privileges to Pariahs.\n\nTheir priests, called Valluvars, always wear the sacred thread as gurus. There are two or three such in N\u00e1njin\u00e1d, and their houses are called, like those of Brahmans, madam.\n\nDuring the war with Tippu, proclamation was made that every Parayan in this district must have a N\u00e1yar or master, and belong to some one or other; all who were not private property would be made slaves of the sirkar (which was greatly dreaded on account of the merciless oppression), and obliged to cut grass for the troops and do other services.\n\nMany, therefore, became nominally slaves to some respectable man, asking it as a kindness to free them from government slavery. This reminds us of the Roman clients and\npatrons. Several respectable families begged the Namb\u00fari high priest, visiting Suchindram and other temples, to call them his slaves, for which they paid him one fanam a head per annum; this payment is still kept up. This priest conferred upon them additional benefits, for in their troubles and oppressions he wrote to the government requiring for them justice and proper treatment. The slaves of a Namb\u00fari would also be treated with consideration on account of his sacred position and rank. These families, \"P\u00f3tty slaves,\" still intermarry only among themselves, as in this case the wife could not be claimed by a different owner from the husband's.\n\nThese Pariahs generally live near tanks and by the riversides, in order to be near the fields of their masters which they cultivate. Sometimes both their houses and the sites on which they stand are the property of their masters: so that whenever they show any disobedience, they are driven away. Their huts are poor and crowded together; cleanliness is little cared for.\n\nLastly, as to the Pariahs of North Travancore. Their condition seems lowest of all, as they enter farther into the Malay\u00e1lam country, and enjoy fewer opportunities of escape from caste degradation and from bitter servitude.\n\n\"Their own tradition has it that they were a division of the Brahmans who were entrapped into a breach of caste by their enemies through making them eat beef. They eat carrion and other loathsome things. The carcases of all domestic animals are claimed by them as belonging to them by right. They frequently poison cows and otherwise kill them for the sake of their flesh. They are also charged with kidnapping women of the higher castes, whom they are said to treat in the most brutal manner. It is their custom to turn robbers in the month of February, in which month, they pretend, the wrong was done them, to break in through the houses of the Brahmans and Nairs, and to carry away their women, children, and property, to which they are actuated more by motives of revenge than of interest, and to justify which they plead the injury their caste had received\nfrom these parties. In former times, they appear to have been able to perpetrate these cruelties almost with impunity, from the fear of which the people still betray great uneasiness, though the custom is now grown into disuse.\" (Rev. G. Matthan, in C. M. Record, 1850.)\n\nThese Pariahs are regarded as polluting by contact, are miserably provided with the necessaries of life, while their persons and property are entirely at the disposal of their masters. The state of these poor creatures is in every point of view most wretched.\nART. XI.\u2014Some Bih\u0101r\u012b Folk-Songs. Contributed GEORGE A. GRIERSON, B.C.S., Member of the Asi Society of Bengal, Officiating Magistrate of Patna.\n\nThe following songs are a portion of those collected by last hot weather, when acting as Magistrate of Patna. They were written down for me in the heart of Bih\u0101r by B\u0101b\u016b Nandan L\u0101l R\u0101y, Deputy Magistrate, a gentleman born bred in the neighbourhood of \u0100r\u0101 (Arrah), who take most lively and intelligent interest in his own beaut native language. I have printed them exactly as they have been taken from the mouths of the reciters, a few obv slips of the pen being alone corrected. I have allowed theories of my own to interfere with the text obtained, I have religiously abstained from consulting even compet native scholars as to probable or possible emendations. Nat in such cases are, as is well known, only too ready to ins readings which have never existed. They have no rever whatever for the words or matter of songs in the vernacu and feel themselves justified in making any alterations additions on the spur of the moment, which may so required by the metre, or more adapted to their pres temperament.\n\nThe great preservers of these songs are the women of classes, and it is therefore impossible for a European to obt them direct from their storekeepers. I am hence dou indebted to B\u0101b\u016b Shiv Nandan L\u0101l R\u0101y, who has given these songs exactly as they have been taken down from mouths of ladies in Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d.\n\nIt may be mentioned here that Bih\u0101r\u012b is the name wh is being adopted to a considerable extent in India for\nlanguage hitherto known as Eastern Hindi. The Government of Bengal is publishing a series of grammars of the dialects of the Bih\u0101r\u012b language, and Dr. Hoernle and myself are busily at work on a dictionary of it.\n\nBih\u0101r\u012b possesses a most elaborate grammatical structure. It has three main dialects, a North-Eastern (the Maithili), a South-Eastern (the M\u0101gadhi or Magah\u012b), and a Western (the Bhojp\u016bri). The first has been grammatically dealt with in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and the extreme western variety of the last (commonly known as Western Bhojp\u016bri) forms the groundwork of Dr. Hoernle's Gaudian Grammar. A grammar, set of fables, and vocabulary of the M\u0101gadhi dialect has just been published by the Government of Bengal, and a grammar of the pure Eastern Bhojp\u016bri spoken near \u0100r\u016b, the chief town of the district of Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d, is in the press, and will shortly be published by the same Government.\n\nThe following songs being collected in Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d may reasonably be expected to be in the Bhojp\u016bri dialect. It will be seen that with one or two exceptions they are, the exceptions being foreign songs introduced into and adopted in Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d, and having their language curiously coloured, so to speak, by the grammatical peculiarities of their new home. These will be pointed out in the proper place.\n\nAs Dr. Hoernle's Gaudian Grammar is in the hands of every one who will care to read these songs, and as there is no great essential difference between the grammars of Eastern and Western Bhojp\u016bri, I have not devoted much space to grammatical explanation. I would, however, here draw attention to the present tense of the Bhojp\u016bri Verb, which should be carefully distinguished from the 2nd preterite (c. Hoernle, \u00a7 520).\n\nThe main difference between the Western and the Eastern forms of Bhojp\u016bri lies in the termination of the oblique form of substantives and pronouns. In Western Bhojp\u016bri, these end in e, but in Eastern Bhojp\u016bri in \u0101 (Old M\u0101gadhi Pr\u0101krit \u0101\u1e25).\nThus the genitival affix in Western Bh. is k\u0101i with an oblique form, ke, while in Eastern Bh. k\u0101i, k\u0113 or k, with an oblique k\u0101. So also the first possessive pronoun is mor \u2018my,\u2019 and its oblique in Western Bhojp\u016br\u012b is more, but in Eastern Bhojp\u016br\u012b mor\u0101. Again, jekar \u2018of whom,\u2019 has its Western oblique form j\u0113k\u2019re, and its Eastern j\u0113k\u2019rd. Full particulars of these oblique forms, especially of the oblique forms of substantives, will be found in my Essay on Bih\u0101ri Declension, lately published in the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society.\u00b9\n\nAnother set of terminations should be noted which is frequently met in poetry. It is hi, h\u012b, hu, or h\u016b. These terminations have two distinct uses. They are commonly used as case terminations for almost any oblique case. They are also used as particles of emphasis meaning \u2018even\u2019 or \u2018also.\u2019 On this point, see also my essay above alluded to.\n\nI have already stated that these songs are printed ipsissimis verbis, as they were recited by women of the Bhojp\u016br\u012b tract. This has its advantages, but, it must be confessed, it also has its disadvantages. The uneducated, and especially women, have a great reverence for the unintelligible, and the love for \u201cthat blessed word Mesopotamia\u201d is just as great in the East as it is in the West. Hence many an obscure word is retained, simply because it is not understood, and finally after generations of ignorant attrition becomes a sound and nothing more, having no meaning in itself, but interesting simply from its unintelligibility. A few instances of such words will be met with in the following songs.\n\nAnother point to be noted in these songs is that they by no means follow the strict and complicated metric laws of Tuls\u012b D\u0101s and Bidy\u0101pati. Nor, considering their singers and preservers, can they be expected to do so. Probably, when they were first written, each line may have contained its orthodox supply of long and short m\u0101tras, but now they are, and for generations they have been, remembered by the melody to\n\n\u00b9 J.A.S.B. vol. lii. part i. 1883.\nwhich they are sung, and by that alone. Any number of\nsyllables, long or short, can be crowded into a line, so long as\nthe need of a musical *ictus* is satisfied.\\(^1\\) Hence no study of\nthe Pr\u0101krit *P\u012bygal*, nor of the *Chhandodipak*, will avail for\nreading these songs, though, as Mr. Beames so happily says,\n\"they trip off the tongue with a lilt and grace which are\nirresistible.\"\n\nLike folk-songs in other languages, these songs abound in\nunmeaning burdens, like the English \"Sing heigh, sing ho,\nthe linden tree,\" and similar passages unconnected with the\nstory, common in Percy's Reliques.\n\nExamples are the unmeaning phrases \u0905\u092c\u0928\u093e in Song No.\n9, and \u0930\u0947 \u092c\u0940 in Song No. 16. These, as a rule, I have\nleft untranslated. To transliterate them would seem only\nridiculous, and to translate them would be impossible without\ndestroying the Oriental colour of the picture which I attempt\nto present to view.\n\nThe Bih\u0101ri language, unlike Hindi, contains a series of\nshort diphthongs which possess no graphic representation in\nthe local character. The local character, indeed, possesses no\ndistinction for length in any of the vowels except *a*, represent-\ning *i* and *i* when initial by *i* (\u0903), and when non-initial by *i* (\u0903),\nand *u* and *u* by *u* (\u0903, \u0903) whether initial or not. This local\ncharacter is known as the Kaithi.\n\nIn transcribing these songs into the N\u0101gari character for\nthe benefit of European scholars, it has been found necessary\nnot only to separate the long and short vowels (*i* and *u*), but\nalso to show clearly the difference between the long and short\ndiphthongs. This has been done by allowing the established\nN\u0101gari signs for *e*, *ai*, *o*, and *au* to retain their usual long\nvalue, and by inventing the following signs, initial and non-\ninitial, for the short diphthongs:\n\n\\(^1\\) A parallel example in English occurs in an extreme case in the famous couplet\nof Tom D'Urfey:\n\"Oh wasn't be a rascal,\nWho refused to allow the children of Israel to go into the wilderness with\ntheir wives and families to eat the Paschal.\"\nIt will be seen that with the exception of the sign for initial \u0113 (which is simply the sign \u1e5b, for e, reversed) all these differ from their corresponding long forms by merely having an upward serpentine instead of a simply curved form for their top strokes.\n\nOne other sign requires notice. Many syllables in these songs which are long by position or by nature, must be read short to fill up the metre properly. These I have still written long, but over them I have placed the mark \u2032, which corresponds with the English brevis \u2032, and is often used for that purpose by natives. This will be found useful in reading the songs aloud.\n\nThe first seven of these songs belong to a class well known throughout India from the earliest times. Sanskrit literature has more than one popular example, and H\u0101la gives detached fragments which seem to come from some similar Pr\u0101krit poem. My own knowledge of modern vernacular folk-songs is confined to Eastern Hind\u016bst\u0101n and the Bengal Presidency, and with regard to this tract I can assert that several songs of the class are popular in every district between Ban\u0101ras and the Brahmaputra. These songs are at the present day called 'B\u0101rah M\u0101sas' or '(songs of) the twelve months.' Their form is always the same. Some woman laments the absence of her beloved or of her son. Each verse is devoted in order to a month of the Hind\u016b year; in it she describes the peculiar woe which she experiences at that season. Thus she goes through the round of the twelve months, and at the last month her patience is generally rewarded by the return of her husband, or of her son, as the case may be.\n\nThe following are the months of the Hindu Fasli year, which is that current in Bih\u0101r:\n\u0100sin or Ku\u0101r, corresponding with the English\n\nK\u0101tik          { September\n          { October\n          { October\n          { November\nAg'han         { November\n          { December\nP\u016bs            { December\n          { January\nM\u0101gh           { January\n          { February\nPh\u0101gun         { February\n          { March\nChait          { March\n          { April\nBais\u0101kh        { April\n          { May\nJeth           { May\n          { June\nAs\u0101rh          { June\n          { July\nS\u0101wan          { July\n          { August\nBh\u0101do          { August\n          { September\n\nThe first of these songs commences with the month As\u0101rh. The name of the singer's husband is given as 'Sh\u0101m,' which never is probably used in its derived sense of 'darling,' original Sh\u0101m, alias Krishn, having been the darling of Cowherdesses of Braj.\n\nI.\n\n\u092a\u093e\u0921\u093c\u0947 \u092e\u094c\u0938 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0926\u0930 \u091a\u0928 \u091a\u092e\u0916 \u0926\u0942\u0938 \u0938\u093e\u091c\u093f \u0915\u0947\u0964\n\u0939\u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0930\u0939\u093f\u0924\u0940 \u0924\u0947\u091c\u093f \u0915\u0947 \u092a\u093f\u091b\u093e \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0939\u094b\u0902 \u091d\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0947\u0965 \u0967\u0965\n\u092c\u093e\u092f\u0928 \u092e\u094c\u0938 \u0938\u094b\u0939\u093e\u092c\u0928, \u0939\u0947 \u0938\u0916\u093f, \u0938\u093e\u0935\u0928 \u092a\u093f\u091b\u094b \u092e\u0928 \u092d\u093e\u0935\u0939\u0940\u0965 \u0968\u0965\n\u092c\u091a\u0928 \u0935\u093f\u0930\u0939\u093f\u0924\u0940 \u092c\u093e\u0922\u093c \u092c\u0940\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e \u092c\u0938 \u0918\u0930 \u092c\u093e\u092f\u0924 \u0917\u0939\u094b\u0965 \u0969\u0965\n\u092d\u093e\u0921\u093c\u094b \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u090f\u0915 \u0916\u0947\u0932 \u092c\u0928\u0924\u0941 \u0939\u0948 \u091a\u0935\u0930 \u0916\u0947\u0932 \u092c\u0917\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0947\u0965 \u096a\u0965\n\u092d\u0940 \u092a\u092a\u093f\u0939\u0930\u093e \u092e\u094b\u0930 \u092c\u094b\u0932\u0947 \u0916\u0947\u0932 \u0918\u0928\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0938\u0924\u0940\u0965 \u096b\u0965\n\u0915\u0941\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u091a\u093e\u0935\u0947 \u092a\u093f\u091b\u093e \u0928 \u091a\u093e\u0935\u0947 \u092d\u0940 \u092e\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u092c\u093f\u0916 \u091d\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0947\u0965 \u096c\u0965\n\u0930\u094b\u091f\u0947 \u092c\u0947 \u092c\u091a \u0918\u094b\u0921\u093c \u092c\u093e\u0939\u094b\u0902 \u0936\u0940\u0936 \u092e\u094c\u0938 \u092c\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0930\u093f \u0915\u0947\u0965 \u096d\u0965\n1. The month of As\u0101rh has commenced. The clouds have arranged their thick army. My beloved has left me deserted, and is sojourning somewhere.\n\n2. Pleasing is the month of S\u0101wan, O friend, my beloved loves the month. What deserted damsel has enchanted him? My husband cometh not home.\n\n3. In Bh\u0101do a bed is being made with care, but the sparrow-hawk and the peacock cry, and it stings me exceedingly.\n\n1 \u0939\u0943\u0926\u093f is a rare form in Bhojp\u016br\u012b. It is probably here the Hindi accusative plural, \u0939\u0943\u0926\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902.\n\n2 Literally, is being made, and having made it.\n\n3 The cry of these birds is supposed to be an incentive to love. \u0938\u093e\u0939\u0938\u0924\u0940 is Hindi pres. part. fem., agreeing with \u0938\u0947\u0915\u094d\u0938, used in the sense of the pres. ind.\n4. Ku\u0101r has come, but not my beloved, let me take poison and die. Weeping let me wash my head with the water (of my tears), and disarrange the parting of my hair.\\(^1\\)\n\n5. In K\u0101tik I am writing a letter, causing tears of blood to flow (for ink). Go, O crow,\\(^2\\) to the country where my beloved is, and tell him the tale of my woes.\n\n6. In Ag\u2019han there is an empty bed, and alone I watch.\\(^3\\) My beloved is gone and sojourns in a far country, how, O friend, can I endure?\n\n7. In P\u016bs a snow-storm has fallen, separation has come and tortures me, nor will the cold leave me, O friend, till my love clasps me in his arms.\n\n8. In M\u0101gh the mango blossoms, let me go mad and die. Without Sh\u0101m the jasmine flowers.\\(^4\\) Who can (at such a season) seek her couch.\n\n9. In Ph\u0101gun\\(^5\\) colour is carefully made ready, but without Sh\u0101m I fly not about, like the balls of red \u0100b\u012br.\n\n10. In Chait instead of cool sandal powder I applied cool fire (i.e. ashes) to my head, and went to seek my husband.\\(^6\\)\n\n11. In B\u0101s\u0101kh heat oppresses me, I die overpowered by it. O friend, when I am oppressed by the heat, to whom shall I tell my condition?\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The parting of a married woman\u2019s hair is coloured with vermillion, which is washed out when she becomes a widow.\n\n\\(^2\\) A crow\u2019s call is said to be \u0921\u093c\u0942\u092f\u093c \u0921\u093c\u0942\u092f\u093c, which means \u2018place.\u2019 He is a great traveller. Hence, by tradition, a crow is always supposed to know the whereabouts of a beloved.\n\n\\(^3\\) \u0924\u093e\u0915\u0924\u0940 is Hindi pres. part. fem.\n\n\\(^4\\) The odour of these two flowers is supposed to incite love.\n\n\\(^5\\) In this month occurs the feast of the Holi\u2014the spring festival of love. It is then customary to throw red powder (\u0101b\u012br) on passers-by in the street.\n\n\\(^6\\) The meaning of this verse is doubtful. My informant, who recited the song, did not know its meaning. Songs like the present one, which are in a language foreign to Bih\u0101r, are often learned by rote, and only half-understood. The translation given is only a guess. \u0928\u0947\u092a\u094d\u0938 I do not know the meaning of, nor is the word known in Bih\u0101r. It may be a corruption of \u0928\u0947\u092a\u094d\u0938\u0940 \u2018a necklace worn by mendicants,\u2019 and in this case \u091c\u093e\u0932 \u0928\u0947\u092a\u094d\u0938\u0940 would mean \u2018having put on such a necklace.\u2019\n12. J\u0113\u1e6dh, the month of J\u0113\u1e6dh has come, and the two months (of my love's journey) are fulfilled.\n\nKing R\u0101m Chandra sang this song of the twelve months to S\u016br.\u00b9\n\nNote on Dialectic Peculiarities.\n\nThis song is interesting as exhibiting the radical difference between the Hindi and Bih\u0101r\u012b languages. It was evidently written originally in the Braj dialect of Hindi, learned such, and adopted in the district of Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d, where Bih\u0101r\u012b is spoken, and where it was found. The Hindi and Bih\u0101r\u012b languages are so distinct in grammatical structure, and in vocabulary, that parts of the song have undergone extreme corruptions and are quite unintelligible. Its grammar is still almost pure Braj, although here and there some Hindi forms (e.g. \u091a\u093e\u0939\u0942\u0901 in v. 1, and \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u091f in v. 12) have been substituted. Examples of forms more or less Braj are \u0915\u0940\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e (pret.) in v. 2; \u092c\u0928\u0924\u0941 \u0939\u0948 (3 sg. pres.) in v. 3; \u091a\u093e\u0939\u0947 (3 pl. pres.) in v. 4; \u0932\u093f\u0916\u0924\u0941 \u0939\u0948 (pres. 3 sg. for 1 sg.); \u092c\u0939\u094b (2 pl. imperat.) in v. 5; and other similar forms. A Hindi translation is also given to many of the sentences, by the free use of the pres. part. (e.g. \u0906\u0935\u0924 in v. 2) in the sense of the pres., which is rare in pure Bhojp\u016br\u012b.\n\nThis song is, in short, an excellent proof that Hindi is not understood in Bih\u0101r, and that it is a cardinal error to regard Hindi as the language of Government, and of the schools receiving Government aid in the Bih\u0101r\u012b tract.\n\nThe next b\u0101rah m\u0101s\u0101 is supposed to be sung by a herdless whom Krishn has deserted. It commences with the month of K\u0101tik.\n\n\u00b9 It is customary for a poet to insert his own name, and that of his patron, at the last line of any of his works. The last line is hence called the bhan\u012bl\u0101, because it tells (root bhan) the name of the author. The poet here politely attributes inspiration to the king.\nII.\n\nRefrain.\u2014\u091a\u093e\u091a\u0940 \u0930\u0947\n\n\u092c\u093f\u0928\u0941 \u092c\u093e\u0932 \u0938\u0941\u0916\u0930

Birds and the like are building their nests, but my beloved is dwelling in a foreign land.\n\n10. In Sawan everything is covered with water,\\(^3\\) and women are giving up their red veils and taking to white ones. They rock themselves in swings, and sing songs, but it seems untimely to me without my love.\n\n11. In Bado the (wind) blows strong in the sky, the rivers are filled, and the streams are swollen.

In Kuar, the peacock cries in the forest, Rise, Rise, O fair one, thy beloved has come,\\(^4\\) now the hope of your mind is fulfilled, and Sur Das sings the song of the twelve months.\n\nNotes on Dialectic Peculiarities.\n\nThis song is in nearly pure Bhojpuri. A few Braj forms have got into it, owing to a traditional theory, widely current, that Braj is the only North Indian Vernacular worthy of a poetic dress. This theory has influenced poets who write in dialects even other from Hindi. Thus, Bangalis claim, though generally wrongly, that their old Bangali hymns are written in a variety of Braj. So also Bihari poets frequently insert Braj forms to show their learning, e.g. \u092c\u0940\u0930\u0941 in v. 2 of the\n\n---\n\n1 Reference is made to the ceremony of Parishan, or welcoming of the bridegroom at the bride's house.\n2 \u091f\u093f\u0915\u0941\u0932\u093f is the silver spot worn on a woman's forehead.\n3 \u091c\u0932\u093f is an inundated piece of ground. \u091c\u0932\u093f is an old oblique form of \u091c\u0932\u093f (like \u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e \u092e\u093e\u0930\u0940 in Hindi). The phrase is hence literally 'an inundation on an inundation,' just as \u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e \u092e\u093e\u0930\u0940 is 'a beating on a beating,' 'a mutual beating.'\n4 \u092c\u0940\u0930\u0941, as a sign of the genitive, is rare in Bhojpuri, but is common in the other dialects of Bihar.\nabove song. At the same time the dialect of this song is very different from that of the first. The first is a Braj song, with a few Bih\u0101ri words introduced.

The chauk\\(^1\\) is filled with elephant pearls and the kalas\\(^2\\) is made of gold, and within are excellent jars.\n\n2. B\u0101s\u0101kh is a season (hot) like poison, the earth and sky are writhing under it. As a fish deprived of water writhes, that is the state to which Kek\u0101i\\(^3\\) has brought me; she has given\\(^4\\) me dire distress.\n\n3. In Jeth the hot wind affects the body, while R\u0101m, Lakhan, and S\u012bt\u0101 are together (in the forest). R\u0101m's feet are tender as lotuses. The earth and sky are writhing, how can he travel on the way.\n\n4. In As\u0101rh the thunder rolls in all directions, the sparrow-hawk cries, and the peacock screams, K\u014dsil\u0101\\(^5\\) laments in her palace in Awadh, Lakhan, S\u012bt\u0101 and R\u0101m will be wet as they stand at the foot of a tree.\n\n5. In S\u0101wan all the tanks and rivers are filled, S\u012bt\u0101 and Raghub\u012br will be wet. Worms and snakes creep about over the earth with R\u0101m, Lakhan, and S\u012bt\u0101, and the night is dark.\n\n6. In Bh\u0101do huge rain drops fall, and all the world are mending the roofs of their houses. S\u012bt\u0101 and Raghub\u012br will be wet with the great large drops as they fall, for the rain is loud and sudden.\\(^6\\)\n\n7. In Ku\u0101r, O friend, is the reign of the God of Virtue, and the whole world is continually arising to do virtuous actions. If, now, R\u0101m were but here, he would have fed Br\u0101hmans and filled dishes with gifts of gold.\n\n8. K\u0101tik, O friend, has come, and the noose of separation\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The chauk is a square space filled with sweetmeats, etc., for distribution at a festival.\n\n\\(^2\\) The jar decked with lights placed within the cupola erected in the courtyard of a house at a marriage festival.

In every house women are lighting lamps, but my Ajodhy\u0101 is dark, and Kekai has done it.\n\n9. In Ag'han virgins adorn themselves, and embroider their garments with golden threads. They wear silk garments, (soft) as woollen (?) ones, and on their heads is the garland\\(^1\\) of the golden Bajanti.\n\n10. In P\u016bs, O friend, falls the frost, and the nights are sharp as the edge of a sword. How will R\u0101m bear a seat of kus grass, and how will he rest in the forest? May her (i.e. Kekai's) birth be cursed.\n\n11. With M\u016bgh, friend, has come the spring, and how will I live without Bhagabant?\\(^2\\) My mind is fixed upon R\u0101m's feet, while Bharath sits and waves a fan (over R\u0101m's shoes)\\(^3\\) in the season of spring.\n\n12. O friend, the jollity of Ph\u0101gun has come, and we sprinkle our bodies with perfume and sandal. Bharath sits and pounds abir, but upon whom shall I scatter it, in R\u0101m's absence?

A mass of boiled pulse and rice. The word is usually feminine, but is masculine in the text.\n\n5. \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935\u093e is long form of \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935\u093e.\n\n6. Or a widow from the date of my marriage. The ch\u0101uk is a square space of coloured meal in which the bridegroom and bride are seated at a marriage ceremony.

The Reverend Guru brought a fruit, and gave it to His Majesty. \"O king, rub and pound this drug, and give it to thy queens to drink.\"\n\n7. One cupful drinks Kosil\u0101, and another cupful drinks Queen Kek\u0101i. Queen Sunitr\u0101 washes the grinding stone and drinks (the water), and the three find that they become pregnant.\n\n8. The maid-servant was sweeping in the court-yard with the maids and damsels. \"O maid-servant, call his Majesty. He understands my pain (and will sympathize).\"\n\n9. King Das'rath was playing dice, and the maid-servant says respectfully, \"O King, your Queen is distraught with pain, and I am come to call your Majesty.\"\n\n10. He threw away the dice at the foot of a Bel and of a Babur tree. Lo, he hastily entered the lying-in chamber, saying, \"Tell me, wife, how thou art.\"\n\n11. \"My head is aching, my legs are paining me, my face hath become pale. Lo, I die, for my loins ache, I desire a midwife.\"\n\n12. The Mah\u0101uts gird up the elephants, on the horses they tie the saddles. And the King started for the Morang, where the midwives live.\n\n13. He asks from passers-by and travellers, from the women who carried water, and from the people of the city, where the midwife lives.\n\n14. The town is well laid out and is a high city, thatched with cane. At her gate there is a sandal tree, where the midwife lives.\n\n15. The horses neighed at the door, and the stones rattled under their feet.

O King, will I not go to thy palace. Return to thine own house.\"\n\n19. Firstly, she was by caste a midwife, and secondly, she speaketh in pride. Hence said she, \"I will not go to thy palace. Return to thine own house.\"\n\n20. \"O midwife, if Lachh\u2019mi become incarnate in my house (i.e. if a daughter is born), I will give thee a garment dyed in Awadh;\u00b9 and if R\u0101m is born in my house, I will give away Awadh.\"\n\n21. \"I will be afraid to mount elephants, and will fall from a horse. O King, send for the Queen\u2019s palankeen. I will mount it and go.\"\n\n22. It was a dear little palankeen of sandal-wood, and covered with cloth. The midwife rode in it, while the cha\u016bri\u00b2 was waved over her.\n\n23. An hour, and a watch of the night passed, and then another watch: then they began to sing songs of joy, and the birth-song arose in the palace.\n\n24. To Kosil\u0101 is born King R\u0101m, to Sumitr\u0101 Lachhuman, to Kek\u0101i King Bharath. In all three palaces is heard the birth-song.\n\n25. They fill the fire pan with cumin-seed, and with an equal weight of cloves. They light lamps of rubies, my house is very pleasant.\n\n26. King Das\u2019rath sat in his audience hall, and the maid-servant says humbly to him: \"O King, a prince has been born in the palace. They are singing the birth-song in the three houses.\"\n\n27. \"Come, my Reverend Br\u0101hman. Mount the platform, and sit. O Br\u0101hman, under what star is R\u0101m born, what happiness will he enjoy?\"\n\n\u00b9 i.e. the complimentary garment given to the midwife on the birth of a child.\n\u00b2 The cha\u016bri is the fly-flapper, which is a sign of royalty.\n28. \"O R\u0101j\u0101, when R\u0101m is twelve years old, he will go to the forest.\" Seated in counsel King Das'rath distributes presents, and changes gold mohars. So, the beggars were made happy, and all the gods and saints were happy.\n\n29. Queen Kosil\u0101 stands at the corner of the door, and advises the King. \"O King, thou knowest that R\u0101m must go to the forest, and yet thou art distributing presents.\"\n\n30. King Das'rath sat in the council and advises the Queen. \"O Queen, the name of 'childless' has departed from me; I care not\\(^1\\) if R\u0101m goes to the forest.\"\n\n31.

When Mah\u0101deb went to his marriage, the bridesmaids all sang the (marriage) blessing. Ghosts and goblins for his marriage party, and he had serpents hanging about his body.\n\n2. Some rode on dogs and some on jackals, and he him on a bull. Sib had a garland of skulls, which he wore round his neck, while he filled his wallet with poisonous snakes.\n\n3. When Mah\u0101deb came to the village site, the boys the procession. They ran away and hid in their houses, saying they would not see a procession again.\n\n4. Instruments are being played,\u2014the bassoon, and timbrel, while the hour-glass drum made a great noise. When Mah\u0101deb arrived at the gate, all the bridesmaids sang marriage blessing.\n\n5. Mad\u0101gini, the bride\u2019s mother, came out to welcome her when the serpents emitted a hiss. She threw away wooden pestle, and flung away her stone one, and ran back (into the house).\n\n6. \u201cI will run away with Gaur\u0101, I will drown myself in Gaur\u0101, with Gaur\u0101 will I enter the lower world, but to such madman of a bridegroom will I not give her. Better for would it be if she remained a virgin.\u201d\n\n7. Gaur\u0101 speaks from behind the jar in (the cupola), \u201cThis is my prayer to Sibji. O Sib, bathe in the Ganges, wash those ashes, and then come back to my father\u2019s house.\u201d\n\n8. \u201cMother, do not drown yourself, nor run away with nor enter the lower world. An ascetic has been written in book of fate, how can it be wiped out?\u201d\n\n9. Sib bathed in the Ganges, rubbed off the ashes, applied sandal to his eight limbs. \u201cWhere is my mother-in-law Mad\u0101gini? Let her now see my appearance.\u201d\n\n10. Hearing this much, the mother-in-law rejoiced,\n\n---\n\n1 See note to II. 8.\n2 These are moved round the bridegroom\u2019s head at the time of parik\u1e63\u0101\u1e47a.\nthought in her mind, \"Gaur\u0101's good fortune has been strong, in that she is getting Mah\u0101deb for a husband.\"\n\n11. \"Now I will prepare the marriage platform, and anoint myself with sandal, and perform the marriage.\"\n\n12.

The ship, the ship, was of eight pieces of wood, and its four heads were adorned with vermilion.\n2. At the landing-place descends the Mir'j\u0101 S\u0101heb, where Bhagabati is bathing.\n3. \"O ye girls who are filling water, whose sister is she who is bathing?\"\n4. \"The head of the village is R\u0101j\u0101 Horil Singh. It is his sister who is bathing.\"\n5. \"Run, thou barber, run thou peon, seize Horil Singh and bring him here.\n6. \"O ye girls who are filling water, where is Horil Singh's house?\"\n7. \"His house faces the north, and towards the north of his doorway is a sandal tree.\"\n8. \"Tie Horil Singh's arms behind his back.\" When Horil Singh came before the Mir'j\u0101, he bent low and saluted him.\n9. \"Take, O Horil Singh, a basketful of gold, and give thy sister Bhagabati.\"\n10. \"O Mir'j\u0101, may fire burn thy basket of gold. No Bhagabati has been born in my family.\"\n11. Bhagabati's sister-in-law (i.e. Horil's wife) comes out of the house, and stands in the courtyard. She stands in the courtyard and weeps.\n12. \"May fire burn thy beauty, Bhagabati. For thy sake my husband is in prison.\"\n13. \"O sister-in-law, take charge of the house, and of its duties, for I will go to release Horil Singh.\"\n\n1. \u092c\u0940\u0930 is a rare instance of the Bih\u0101r\u012b genitive suffix \u092c\u0947\u0930 taking a fem. form. \u092c\u0947\u0930, itself, is rare in Rhojp\u016br\u012b.\n2. It is hardly necessary to point out that \u0930\u0942\u092a\u093f is for \u0930\u0942\u092a\u093f the instrumental of \u0930\u0942\u092a\u093f.\n3. Note the word for give put in the mouth of a Muhammadan. It is the Urdu \u0644\u0634\u06a9\u0631.\n14. When Bhagabati came before the Mir'j\u0101, she bent low and saluted him.\n\n15. \"If, O Mir'j\u0101, thou desire me, unloose the bonds of Horil Singh.\n\n16. \"If, O Mir'j\u0101, thou desire me, dye a dyed garment fit for me.\n\n17. \"If, O Mir'j\u0101, thou desire me, have ornaments made fit for me.\n\n18. \"If, O Mir'j\u0101, thou desire me, have made ready a palankeen fit for me.\"\n\n19. Laughing, laughing, did the Mir'j\u0101 have the ornaments made, and weeping, weeping did the girl Bhagabati put them on.\n\n20. Laughing, laughing, did the Mir'j\u0101 have a dyed garment dyed for her, and weeping, weeping did the girl Bhagabati put it on.\n\n21. Laughing, laughing, did the Mir'j\u0101 have the palankeen made ready for her, and weeping, weeping, did the girl mount it.\n\n22. One league they went, a second league did they go, and there came to her a slight thirst.\n\n23. \"I fall at thy feet, O first palankeen-bearer, let me drink one drop of water.\"\n\n24. \"Drink out of the Mir'j\u0101's cup.\"\n\n25. \"I will often drink out of your cup, O Mir'j\u0101, but my father's tank will soon be hard to drink from.\"\n\n26. She drank one handful, and then a second, and at the third she threw herself into the deep water, and was drowned.\n\n27. The Mir'j\u0101 weeps, and hides his face in his handkerchief, saying, \"Bhagabati hath made a fool of me.\"\n\n28. Weeping, weeping, the Mir'ja lets down a net, but only shells and weeds were brought up.\n\n29. Laughing, doth Horil Singh let down a net, and brought up his sister Bhagabati.\n\n30. Horil Singh laughs, and eats betel, saying, \"My sister Bhagabati hath preserved (the honour of) three generations.\"\nNOTES ON DIALECTIC PECULIARITIES.\n\n\u092d\u093e\u091f\u094d\u0920\u093f, in v. 1, is oblique of \u092d\u093e\u091f 'eight.' \u092d\u093e\u091f\u093f, in v. 2, is locative of \u092d\u093e\u091f 'a landing-place,' and \u092c\u0941\u091a\u094d\u091a\u0947, in v. 24, of \u092c\u0941\u091a\u094d\u091a\u093e the long form of \u092c\u0941\u091a\u094d\u091a\u093e 'a cup,' of which \u092c\u0941\u091a\u094d\u091a\u093e, in v. 25, is the locative of the short form. \u0924\u093f\u0938\u0930\u0947, in v. 26, is the locative of \u0938\u0940\u0938\u0930 'third.'\n\nXVII.\n\nRefrain.\u2014\u092c\u0939\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f \u0928\u0926\u093f\u092f\u093e \u091a\u093e\u0930\u0938\u093f \u092c\u0939\u0948 \u0930\u093e\u092e \u092a\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e\n\n\u092a\u0940\u092f\u093e \u091a\u093e\u0930\u0938\u093f \u092e\u094b\u0930\u0947\u0902 \u0926\u0947\u0916\u093e, \u0935\u093f\u0939\u0930\u0947\u0902\u0915\u093e \u0930\u093e\u092e \u091b\u0924\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0964\n\n\u091c\u094b \u0939\u092e \u091c\u0928\u093f\u0924\u094b\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u092c\u094b\u092d\u093f\u092f\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u0930\u0947 \u092c\u093f\u0926\u0947\u0916\u093e\u0964\n\n\u092a\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u092a\u091f\u094d\u091f\u0935\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u092c\u094b\u092d\u093f\u092f\u093e \u091a\u093e\u0930\u0938\u093f \u091b\u093f\u092a\u093f\u0924\u094b\u0902\u0965 \u0967\u0965\n\n\u0926\u0939 \u0930\u0947\u0916\u093f \u091a\u093e\u0930\u0938\u093f \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0964\n\n\u0935\u093f\u0915\u094b\u0939\u0930\u093e \u0915\u0940\u0938\u0947 \u0930\u093e\u092e \u091a\u093e\u0930\u0938\u093f\u0965 \u0968\u0965\n\n\u0938\u0941\u0908 \u0924\u0940\u0930 \u0908\u091a\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u092c\u094b\u092d\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0938\u0941\u0916 \u0915\u0947 \u091c\u094b\u0932\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0964\n\n\u091a\u094b\u0930\u093f\u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0940\u0930 \u0908\u091a\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u092c\u094b\u092d\u093f\u092f\u093e \u091a\u093e\u0930\u0938\u093f \u0915\u0947 \u092b\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0965 \u0969\u0965\n\n\u091a\u093e\u0930\u0938\u093f \u0924\u0940\u0930 \u0908\u091a\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u092c\u094b\u092d\u093f\u092f\u093e \u091a\u093e\u0930\u0938\u093f \u0915\u0947 \u0922\u094b\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0964\n\n\u092d\u094b\u0921\u093c \u0924\u0940\u0930 \u0908\u091a\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u092c\u094b\u092d\u093f\u092f\u093e \u091a\u093e\u0930\u0938\u093f \u092c\u0917\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0965 \u096a\u0965\n\n\u092d\u094b\u0921\u093c \u0924\u0940\u0930 \u0908\u091a\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u092c\u094b\u092d\u093f\u092f\u093e \u091a\u093e\u0930\u0938\u093f \u092a\u0928\u0935\u093e\u0964\n\n\u091a\u094b\u0930 \u0924\u0940\u0930 \u0908\u091a\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u092c\u094b\u092d\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092c\u0922\u093c\u093f \u092c\u0922\u093c\u093f \u092e\u094b\u0939\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0965 \u096b\u0965\n\n\u091a\u094b\u0930\u093f\u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0940\u0930 \u0908\u091a\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u092c\u094b\u092d\u093f\u092f\u093e \u091a\u094b\u092c\u0930\u0928 \u0938\u094b\u091f\u0947\u0902\u0964\n\n\u092a\u0947\u091f \u0924\u0940\u0930 \u0908\u091a\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u092c\u094b\u092d\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0930\u0923 \u092a\u0924\u0935\u093e\u0965 \u096c\u0965\n\n\u0936\u0940\u0920 \u0924\u0940\u0930 \u0908\u091a\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u092c\u094b\u092d\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0927\u094b\u092d\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u092a\u091f\u0935\u093e\u0964\n\n\u092c\u094b\u0921\u093c \u0924\u0940\u0930 \u0908\u091a\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930 \u092c\u094b\u092d\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092c\u0947\u0930\u0935\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u091a\u0941\u0928\u0935\u093e\u0965 \u096d\u0965\nRefrain.\u2014The river is deep, and the water flows bottomless.

Beal, M.R.A.S.\n\nThere are several passages in the Si-yu-ki that deserve more notice than can be given in a foot-note by a translator. To some of these I will call attention in this paper. My remarks may appear in some cases too discursive; but I trust this may be pardoned, as they are but \"Gleanings.\"\n\nI. \u4e09\u6703\u8aaa\u6cd5\n\nThere is a passage in the 7th book (p. 2 in the original, p. 357 in the first vol. of Julien's translation). The pilgrim is speaking of a st\u016bpa in the \"deer garden\" at Banaras; this st\u016bpa was erected to commemorate the prediction uttered on the spot about Maitr\u0113ya becoming a Buddha; the translation runs thus: \"This is the spot where Maitr\u0113ya Bodhisattva received assurance that he would become a Buddha; in future years when the country of Jambudvipa shall be at peace... there will be a Br\u0101hman called Maitr\u0113ya, whose body will be the colour of pure gold; leaving his home he will become 'perfectly enlightened,' and preach the three-fold law, for the benefit of all living things,\" or \"he will widely diffuse the three-fold\u2014spoken\u2014law for the benefit of all that lives.\" The expression \"three-fold\" in this passage is san huui, which Julien translates by \"three assemblies,\" thus: \"He will obtain superior intelligence, and in three great assemblies he will exhibit the law for the sake of all men.\"\n\n1 Commonly cited as Jul. ii.\n2 Mrigad\u0101va.\n3 \u6210\u6b63\u89ba i.e. perfect Sambuddhi.\n4 \u4e09\u6703.\n5 Jul. ii. loc. cit.\nIt is true the word *hui* means \"an assembly\"; but the rendering of \u4e09\u6703\u8aaa\u6cd5 by \"preaching the law in three great assemblies,\" does not quite commend itself. We may seek therefore another meaning of the passage. Now the law of Buddha is described as \"a triple, twelve-part, trustworthy knowledge.\" Thus we read, \"And so long, O monks, as I did not possess in perfect clearness this triple, twelve-part, trustworthy, knowledge and understanding of these four sacred truths, so long, O monks, I knew that I had not attained the supreme Buddhahood;\" and in a note the writer explains the expression thus: \"Of each of the four truths Buddha possessed a tripartite knowledge, e.g. of the first: 'this is the sacred truth of suffering,' 'this sacred truth of suffering must be understood,' 'I have understood this sacred truth of suffering.'\"\n\nThus having this three-fold, or tripartite, knowledge of each of the four sacred truths, the law is described as \"a three-fold, twelve-part law.\"\n\nThis point is explained by M. L\u00e9on Feer in his \u00c9tudes Bouddhiques, 1st series, p. 267, where he is describing \"the duodecimal evolution of the truths\"; in explanation of this phrase, he says that each of the four truths must be first of all announced, thus: \"suffering exists\"; secondly, it must be understood, thus: \"It is necessary to know to the bottom the existence of suffering\"; and thirdly, it must be declared that this knowledge has been attained, thus: \"I have understood to the bottom the existence of suffering.\"\n\nThis, again, is the three-fold, or tripartite, division of the four truths, composing the law, first declared at Banaras by Buddha, after his enlightenment.\n\nThe text, therefore, of the Si-yu-ki asserts that Maitreya, after he has attained Buddhahood, will, like other Buddhas, preach at Banaras this three-fold, or tripartite, law; and\n\n---\n\n1 Oldenberg, Buddha, p. 129.\n2 op. cit. p. 129 n.\n3 I.

'This must be accomplished.'\n4 i.e. the four \"sacred truths,\" see the preceding note.\nso \u00c1\u015bvaghosha says: \"All the M\u00fbnis who perfect wisdom must do so at Gay\u00e2, and in the K\u00e2\u015bi country they must first turn the wheel of righteousness.\"\u00b9\n\nIt seems that the Sanskrit term corresponding to the Chinese san hicui, is trik\u00fb\u1e6daka.\u00b2 This is illustrated by one of the Bharhut sculptures; it will be found in General Cunningham's work\u00b3 among the historical scenes, Plate xxviii. disc No. 1. It is the figure of a triangle and labelled \"Tikutiko chakamo,\" i.e. \"the three-pointed wheel (of the law);\u201d\u2074 here tikutiko seems to correspond with san hicui and to refer to \"the turning of the wheel of the law,\" in the three-fold, tripartite way already described. General Cunningham indeed\u2075 explains the sculpture as indicating the N\u00e2galoka under the trik\u00fb\u1e6da paracata, which supports Mount Meru;\u2076 the presence of the lions, however, he says, \"does not favour this view;\" nor does the inscription seem to bear it out, for even if chakamo might refer to a division of the ancient Indian universe, yet that division, viz. of the N\u00e2galoaka, is not itself three-pointed, but situated beneath a mountain with three peaks, or points. I think, therefore, that the scene is intended to represent the turning of the wheel of the law, in a three-fold way. This will be further seen from a comparison of the Chinese symbol hicui with the Sanskrit k\u00fb\u1e6da in another place; I refer to the well-known s\u016btra called Ratnak\u00fb\u1e6da, or \"Heaps of Gems.\" In Chinese the title of this work is P\u00e2o-tsih, \"a multitude or mine (dkara) of jewels;\"\u2077 but this multitude consists of separate heaps, or piles, which in Chinese are called hicui. This may be seen by referring to the \"Catalogue of the Chinese Tripitaka,\"\u2078 where on p. 9 this book is alluded to. It will be seen that each s\u016btra of the 49 contained in the collection\n\n\u00b9 Fo-sho-hing-tsan-king, p. 171.\n\u00b2 K\u00fb\u1e6da means 'a meeting point,' and so does hicui; I think the idea in such compounds as trik\u00fb\u1e6daka and san hicui is the three-fold or triple point. We still use the word 'point' in this sense; we say 'the first point,' 'the second point,' etc.\n\u00b3 St\u00fbpas of Bharhut, by Major-Gen. A.

These portions (\u6703) make up the whole work, called perhaps for that reason Ratnak\u00fb\u1e6da.\\(^1\\)\n\nII. \u5371\u7136\n\nThere is a passage in the sixth book, and on the eleventh page.\\(^2\\) It has been passed over in the French translation: but I think it is of importance, as it illustrates one of the Amar\u0101vati sculptures, and is otherwise interesting. Hiuen Tsiang tells us, in the passage referred to, that within the eastern gate of Kapilavastu, on the left side of the road, was the place where Sarv\u0101rtha\u015biddha, the prince, practised athletic exercises; and outside the gate was a Temple of \u012a\u015bvarad\u0113va. He then adds that in this temple was a stone figure of the god in a position of \u201crising and bending,\u201d or, \u201crising bendingly.\u201d Julien has translated the words thus: \u201cThere is in this temple a stone statue of the god of an imposing size.\u201d\\(^3\\) But the phrase wei in\\(^4\\) seems to me to mean \u201cbendingly,\u201d or \u201cin a bending position.\u201d It refers to the story of the prince being taken to the Temple when he was a child, and the image of the god rising to salute him. The observation as to his attitude is important; for when we turn to the 69th Plate, \u201cTree and Serpent Worship,\u201d we see the force of the phrase. The chief object there is a gigantic form \u201crising bendingly.\u201d The figure is saluting some persons carrying a cloth with the foot-impress of Buddha. This is \u012a\u015bvarad\u0113va saluting the infant as described in the Si-yu-ki. It is curious that the phrase employed by Hiuen Tsiang in relation to a scene at Kapilavastu should be so\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I would call attention to Julien\u2019s remarks on the right restoration of the symbol leih \u7a4d, Jul. ii. 385 n. With respect to my remarks on the symbol \u50b3 I wish to add that it may refer to the cycles of each Buddha\u2019s teaching, which also were three, viz. the empty, the false, the medial; thus, (1) all things are empty, i.e. non-existent. (2) all things, though empty, or unreal, have a false existence. (3) All things exist and do not exist.\n\n\\(^2\\) Jul. ii. p. 321.\n\n\\(^3\\) Jul. ii. p. 321.\n\n\\(^4\\) \u5371\u7136.\naccurately verified by a group found at Amar\u0101vati; it seems to show that this building was not only constructed with all the art of Bactria, but was also indebted to North India for some of the details of its sculptures.\n\nIII. \u4f5b\u8aa0\u771f\u7530\n\nThere is a third passage in the Si-yu-ki which suggests an explanation of one of the Bharhut discs. I refer to the account relating to the purchase of the ground at \u015ar\u0101vasti for the erection of a vih\u0101ra; it occurs at the beginning of the 6th book.\u00b9 The Prince J\u0113ta seems to have repented of his agreement with Sudatta,\u00b2 which was, \u201cto give the land, if the merchant could cover it with gold pieces.\u201d When there was only a small space left, he came to the spot and begged Sudatta to discontinue his work, for \u201che would not give the site\u201d; the scene is thus described by A\u015bvaghosha:\u00b3 \u201cThe householder, his heart rejoicing, forthwith began to spread the yellow gold; then J\u0113ta said, \u2018I will not give, why then spread you your gold?\u2019 The householder replied, \u2018Not give! why then said you, \u201cFill it with yellow gold\u201d? \u2019 And thus they differed and contended both, till they resorted to the magistrate.\u201d\n\nThis appears to me to be the meaning of the passage in the Si-yu-ki, \u201cThere was yet a little space not filled. The prince thereon asked him to desist, but he replied, \u2018The honest, fertile field of Buddha is the one in which we ought to sow good seed;\u2019\u201d\u2074 that is, the promise made should be truthfully kept, viz. of giving the land.\n\nNow if this be the true meaning of the passage, I think the Bharhut sculpture, Pl. xlv. No. 9, must refer to this incident. General Cunningham,\u2075 in his remarks on the inscription chitu-p\u0101da-sila, refers the scene to the history of a r\u0101ja called Ch\u0113tiya, who told the first lie; and then, he\n\n\u00b9 Jul. ii. p. 297.\n\u00b2 Anathapindada.\n\u00b3 Fe-she-king-tean-king, p. 217, Beal\u2019s Translation.\n\u2074 The whole passage runs thus: \u4f5b\u8aa0\u771f\u7530\u5b9c\u690d\u5584\u7a2e.\n\u2075 Bharhut St\u016bpa, p. 94.\nadds, \"In the Bharhut sculpture perhaps the point of the story may have been the first occurrence of cheating, and the consequent punishment of the offender.\" This seems to be a likely explanation of the purpose of the scene and inscription; but may we not refer the actual plot, or incident, of the sculpture, to the attempt of J\u0113ta to cheat the merchant, as recorded both by Hiuen Tsiang and A\u015bvaghosha? and the remark of General Cunningham, \"that the small square pieces with marks on the top .. are exactly the same as the coins used for paving the J\u0113tavana,\" confirms this explanation. I take the square space therefore, marked out like a draught-board, to indicate \"the small space not yet filled,\" and the broken rock to signify the \"broken promise\" of the Prince J\u0113ta, and his attempt to cheat the merchant, after having bargained to give the land.\n\nIV. \u81f3\u90a3\u63d0\u5a46\u58d3\u963b\u7f85\n\nThere is a curious story told towards the end of the the 12th Book of the Si-yu-ki respecting a prince of Persia, who was affianced to a daughter of Han; the bride having arrived as far as Tush Kurghan, in the middle of the Tsu'ng ling, was visited by the Sun-god, and bore to him a child of supernatural power and beauty; \"he was able to fly through the air, and control the winds and the snow. He extended his power and the renown of his laws far and wide, and the neighbouring people as well as those at a distance subscribed themselves his subjects.\" A palace was built for the princess at the top of a rocky peak, where, conjointly with her son, she conducted the affairs of the Empire.\n\nWe seem to have in this story a form of the Persian legend about Kai Ko\u1e63rav. He was the son of the Persian Sy\u0101vaksh and of the daughter of the Turanian Afr\u0101sy\u0101b. His renown was also far spread, and he avenged the\n\n1 Bharhut St\u00e9pa, p. 94.\n2 Jul. iii. 211.\n3 K'ie-pan-to.\n4 See S.B.E., vol. xxiii. p. 64 n. 1.\nmurder of his father by slaying his grandfather, Afr\u0101sy\u0101b, and overthrowing the Turanian kingdom.\n\nThe introduction of the \"daughter of Han,\" may perhaps have originated in the ambiguous form of the province of Chin\u00b9 and M\u0101chin, which Afr\u0101sy\u0101b gave his daughter as a dower. Mr. West, in his Pahlavi Texts,\u00b2 tells us that the country of S\u0113ni, which is Ch\u012bnist\u0101n, was probably the territory of Samarkand. Here Sy\u0101vaksh dwelt in the town of Kangha, which was built on the top of a high mountain, and is called, in the Sh\u0101h N\u0101mah, Kang dez, the fortress of Kangha.\n\nChin being mistaken for China,\u00b3 led to the idea that the daughter of Afr\u0101sy\u0101b was a princess of Han.\n\nV. \u89aa\u8ca8\u9084\u5716\n\nThis intermingling of names suggests the inquiry whether the country of Tu-ho-lo, so constantly named by Hiuen Tsang, and called the \"old territory\"\u2074 of the Tu-ho-lo country, or kingdom, may not be restored to T\u00fbr, or T\u00fbrya. The middle symbol ho represents the rough aspirate, we should thus get Tuhra or Tu\u03c7ra, from which would come the Greek Tocharoi. At any rate, without going so far as a recent writer,\u2075 who would find in the Tu-ho-lo people the Greek Teuchri, I see no reason why the Tochari, or the people of Tu-ho-lo, should be confused with any Turkish horde, or with the Yue-chi.\u2076 They probably represent an old civilized Turanian people dwelling between the borders of Persia and the centre of the Ts'ung ling Mountains. This was just the territory of Afr\u0101sy\u0101b, until it was broken up by Kai Kosav; it then became the prey of every invader and\n\n\u00b9 \u81f3\u90a3.\n\u00b2 \"But we must observe that the country of S\u0113ni which is Ch\u012bnist\u0101n (K\u012bnist\u0101n) was probably the territory of Samarkand and may perhaps be connected with Mount Kino.\"\u2014West's Pahlavi Texts, S.B.K., Part i. p. 69 n.\n\u00b3 Compare Col.

So in the *Si-yu-ki* Hiuen Tsiang describes the *Tu-ho-lo* country as extending 3000 li from Persia to the Ts\u2019ung ling Mountains, and 1000 li from the iron-gates to the Hindu K\u00fbsh; but he takes care to speak of it as the \u201cold territory\u201d; it had now been overrun by the *Tuh-kiue* or Turks proper, and was no longer an independent state.\n\nVI. \u6708\u652f or \u6708\u6c0f\n\nThe Yue-chi are not named in the *Si-yu-ki*, and only once in the \u201cLife of Hiuen Tsiang.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese characters, however, for the Yue-chi and the Vrijjis, who lived at Vai\u015b\u0101li, are the same. This circumstance alone would not be sufficient to warrant any conclusion as to their identity. But other considerations seem to support such an opinion. I have referred to these elsewhere; it will be enough therefore to name the sculptures at Sanchi (Pl. xxxviii. *Tree and Serpent Worship*), showing that the Vrijjis were a Scythian people; and also that the Lichchhavis or Litsabyis, who were the same as the Vrijjis, are stated by Hodgson and Foucaux to be Scythians.\n\nBut if the Vrijjis were Scythians, and their name be phonetically represented in Chinese by the same symbols as the Yue-chi, who were also Scythians, it would follow that the Yue-chi and the Vrijjis were one people.\n\nWe have a description of the manners and customs of the Vrijjis, the people of Vai\u015b\u0101li, in the *Parinibb\u0101na* Sutta. This description shows that they were not a barbarous tribe like the later Yue-chi invaders (called Indo-Scyths) and the Ye-tha (*i.e.* Ephthalites), but were an independent, chivalrous, and proud people.\n\n---\n\n1 Book I.

And ordering a number of magnificent carriages to be made ready, they mounted one of them and proceeded with their train to Ves\u0101l\u012b. Some of them were dark, dark in colour and wearing dark clothes and ornaments; some of them were fair, fair in colour and wearing light clothes and ornaments; some of them were red, ruddy in colour and wearing red clothes and ornaments; some of them were white, pale in colour and wearing white clothes and ornaments.\"\u00b3\n\nThese accounts of the Vrijjis, taken in connection with the Sanchi sculpture and the term Lichchhavi, tend to show that they were foreigners, and as Aj\u0101ta\u015batru was fortifying his frontiers against them, probably they were invaders.\n\nAssuming, then, that the Vrijjis were Yue-chi, we must suppose that one branch of these people had penetrated to the south about the same time that another tribe of the same family had proceeded eastward to Tangut. The centre or nidus of the race would be the region of the Massaget\u00e6, to the eastward of the Jaxartes.

V. de St.-Martin (Les Huns Blancs, p. 37, n. 1), indeed, says that this theory \"p\u00e9che par sa base,\" because the Massaget\u00e6 are spoken of by Herodotus; whereas the Yue-chi had not arrived in Songaria from Tangut till about the year 128 B.C. But the old home of the Yue-chi was not in Tangut. They were strangers there, different in manners, language, and dress from Chinese and Turks. When they were driven thence by the Hiung-nu, they seem to have proceeded towards their ancient territory on the borders of the Jaxartes; they attacked the Ta-hia from the west,\u00b9 and after this the Parthians; being defeated by these, they were driven south towards India; from this time they became known as Indo-Scyths or Gushans. The old sound of Yue \u6708 was \"Get\"; the Chinese symbols would thus correspond with the Greek form \u0393\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9. I think the commotions which took place in Central Asia during the reigns of Cyrus and Darius Hystaspes, would quite explain an irruption of a tribe of the Get\u00e6 into India, where they were known as Vrijjis, and eastward into Tangut, where they became known to the Chinese.\n\nThe Ye-thas,\u00b2 from Sung-Yun's account, were the most powerful of the four tribes (i.e. of the Turkish tribes then advancing westward), and remained idolaters and comparatively barbarous, down to the time when they were defeated at the hands of Khosru Naoshirwan,\u00b3 and finally, in 571 A.D., completely shattered by the invasion of the Turkish Khakan. They must not be confused with the Yue-chi; they were the Ephthalites of the Byzantine writers.\n\nI cannot think, then, that Hiuen Tsiang, in referring to the \"old territory\" of Tu-ho-lo, in which now the Tuhkioue were dwelling, means the old territory of the Yue-chi, or of the Ye-tha, but the kingdom of Tu-ho-lo that spread at one time from Persia to Tush-Kurghan, and was broken up by the Persians, and finally overrun by Northern barbarous tribes.\n\n\u00b9 Kingsmill, J.R.A.S.

It is a term equally familiar in Brahmanical books as in Buddhist writings; nevertheless, as it depends on certain cosmological imaginations, which under this special form have only been transmitted to us by the Buddhists, . . . it has every right to be considered and treated as specially Buddhistic.\"\n\nThese are the words of M. S\u00e9nart;\u00b9 the cosmological theories of the Buddhists are, I believe, essentially different from those of the Brahmans, and derived from a different source. This has been frequently referred to, and I have called special attention to it elsewhere.\u00b2\n\nThe Buddhist theory of the thirty-three gods dwelling on Mount Sumeru in the Triyastrimshas heaven, refers to the year, the four quarters, and the twenty-eight days of the month.\u00b3 This differs from the Brahmanical interpretation. But it seems to me more primitive and rational. There was a period when Saturnus ruled the gods, and he as \"Time\" (K\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2) was supreme over the divisions of the year. This was the golden age,\u2074 and the reiterated accounts of the character of a Chakravartti's dominion and government, found in Buddhist books, point to this golden age.\n\nIt has been noticed that from the word annulus still\n\n\u00b9 La l\u00e9gende du Buddha, p. 11.\n\u00b2 Abstract of Four Lectures, p. 146.\n\u00b3 In the Commentary to the Shu lang S\u016btra, K. vi. fol. 8a. it is said that each of the \"four Kings\" (Chaturmah\u0101r\u0101jas) has 91 sons, and that these, collectively amounting to 364, look after the world throughout the year. But in the older accounts given by Jin Ch'au (Catena, etc. p. 73) it is said that each King has 28 generals; does not this refer to an older mythology, in which the lunar month of 28 days was followed?

I refer to Grimm's \"Teutonic Mythology,\"\u00b3 where we read, \"Who does not see that Sitivrat is the Slavic name for Saturn?\" and he goes on a few lines down, \"I should prefer to give Sitivrat the subordinate meaning of Sito-vrat, 'sieve-turner,' so that it would almost be the same as Kolo-vrat 'wheel-turner,' and afford a solution of that wheel in Krodo's (Saturn's) hand: both wheel (kolo) and sieve (sito) move round, and an ancient spell rested on sieve-turning.\"\n\nThe wheel in Saturn's hand refers to an image of this god, in which he is represented as \"standing on a great fish, with a pot of flowers in his right hand and a wheel erect in his left.\"\u2074\n\nIt is sufficient to have a hint here given (although, as Grimm says, these coincidences are still meagre and insecure) that Saturn, as the lord of Time, was regarded as the wheel-roller. The Chakravarttin monarch also \"makes the wheels of his chariot roll without obstacle athwart all lands,\"\u2075 and his was \"a golden age of universal peace and prosperity.\" I think we have authority therefore for supposing that this was the origin of the myth revived, or preserved, in the Buddhist speculations respecting this fabulous sovereign.\n\nThere are one or two observations which I will venture to add to the above. Why is the Chakravartti monarch called \"holy\"?\u2076 It seems to me, from the idea of perfect truthfulness involved in the idea of Sitivrat, which corresponds to Satyavrata, as it denotes one \"who adheres to\n\n\u00b9 Virg.

Herodotus also tells us that the Persians (who worshipped the Sun especially) held it to be disgraceful, \u201cto lie\u201d; now all this, as it seems to me, was derived from the truthfulness of Time, considered in the abstract; and I think it a reasonable supposition that the origin of the myth of Saturn\u2019s dethronement and the confusion in heaven and the decay of the golden age, is to be found in the first discovery or rather realization of the apparent untrue movements of the Sun, and the disarrangement of time, as the equinoctial points advanced, and the seasons in consequence appeared to change.\u00b2 In any case there is no difficulty in seeing why Buddha claimed to be of the holy race of \u201cthe wheel-turning kings,\u201d represented by Satyavrata, or Saturn, the veracious.\n\nIf the \u201cgolden year\u201d was represented by a wheel, it would appear that the Roman Saturn \u201cwas furnished with a sickle\u00b3 and not with a wheel.\u201d Why so? Because they regarded the Moon rather than the Sun as the arbiter of time.

Calamine stone is, I believe, a silicate of zinc, and from remote antiquity has been used in the manufacture of brass. Long before zinc was procured in its metallic form, this calamine stone was calcined and powdered, and, being mixed with grain copper, or copper clippings and charcoal, was exposed to great heat in crucibles, and so the brass was formed. In the Si-yu-ki the calamine stone is spoken of as brass\u2014reminding us of the saying, \"out of their hills they shall dig brass.\" But it is only by accommodation, or licence, that it is so named. The stone itself is the silicate of zinc spoken of. But why is it called calamine? The Chinese tell us it is found in the Po-sse country, and thence exported. By the Po-sse country we must understand Persia, because Hiuen Tsiang tells us so in the 11th book of the Si-yu-ki, and the 22nd page.\n\nI should suppose, then, that it was called \"Calamine stone\" either because of its resemblance to the \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u1f78 \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03c3\u03ac\u03ba\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9, \"honey of a reed called sugar,\"\n\n\u00b9 I am aware of M. S\u00e9na\u00eft's learned explanation of the Chakravarti and his insignia. Nothing that I have said is designed to interfere with his theory; I think, however, the earliest idea of the Universal monarch must be sought in the primitive conception of the 'golden year.'\n\n\u00b2 K. ix. 48 with k. xi. 48, and vid.

II. xxxiv. 2.\nwhich was exported from Baragyza;\u00b9 or else from the name of the town Kalamina, which, according to Cunningham, was the capital of Indo-Scythia,\u00b2 the same as Minnagara; and this last place the same writer seems to identify with Patala\u00b3 or Potala, the capital of lower Sindh.\u2074\n\nWe come now to consider a probable origin of this word Kalamina. General Cunningham \"feels inclined to derive it from Kara-Mina, the black Mina, to distinguish it from the older city of Min in Sakastene.\"\u2075 He adds in a note that \"Calamine may also be interpreted as Kilah-mina, or the 'fort of Min,' as Sir H. Rawlinson has shown that the original Semitic word for a fort was Kar, which was corrupted very early to kal and khal, as in Khalasar, the Fort of Asshur, Kalicdeh, the Fort of Wad,\" etc.\n\nFather Kircher quotes Steph. le Moyne, who says, \"Calaminam existere tantum in Utopi\u00e2 et cerebro mal\u00e9 feriato.\" Kircher himself reads Calurmina for Calamina, and says that the word signifies \"upon a stone,\" because the Malabars say that St. Thomas (who was martyred at Calamina, according to some accounts) was pierced by a Brahmin on a stone figured with crosses, which is still shown.\u2076\n\nBut if we remember that P\u00f3ta-la, the Portus of the Indus (compare Portus on the Tiber, opposite Ostia, from being bishop of which place Hippolitus derived his title Portuensis), was from time immemorial the seat of the Ikshv\u00e2ku sovereigns, of the \u015a\u00e2kya race, we may perhaps arrive at a natural derivation of the name Kalamina. It was a Greek form\u2077 of the abode or town of the \"Ikshus,\" the family of \"the sweet sugar-cane\" (Calamus). The first lines of \"The Life of Buddha\" (Buddha-charita) written by \u00c1\u015bvaghosha just at the beginning of our era, and who himself was a follower of Kanishka, are these:\n\n\u00b9 Muller, Geog.

He was commissioned to repair to this place to build a palace for Gondoferus. In the Saxon life of St. Thomas, which is ascribed to Elfric, the legendary account is: \"The Saviour himself came to him from heaven and said, 'A king of the Indians, who is called Gundoforus, will send his gerefa to Syria's land to seek some labourer who is skilful in arts. I will soon send thee forth with him.' Thomas answered, 'Send me whither thou wilt except to the Indians.' But on the command to go being repeated he assented: and when the regal officer came they went together to the ship, and reared their sail and proceeded with the wind; and they sailed forth then seven nights before they reached the shore; but it would be long to tell all the wonders he did there. They came next to the king in India, and Abannes boldly brought Thomas to the speech of the king, who said to him: 'Canst thou build me a kingly mansion in the Roman manner?' Thomas tried and succeeded, and had then liberty to preach, and baptized and constructed a church, and Migdonia the king's sister believed what he taught.\"\u2014Cott. MS. A. 14, pp. 112-118.\n\nThe story in the Golden Legend differs somewhat from the above, but is to the same effect as regards the mission of St. Thomas to build a palace for Gondoferus.\n\nWith regard to Gondoferus or Yndopheres we read in von Sallet:\n\n\"At first nothing of this king existed but a mass of coins which were according to their style relegated to a tolerably late date soon after the last Azes-coins. Then the coins of 'Abdagases, the brother's son of Gyndepher(es),' were added. Abdagases, according to Tacitus, was a Parthian dynast; therefore the Parthian descent of Yndopheres became\nprobable; which, as well as the immediate contact of his boundaries with those of the Arsakedan realm, is satisfactorily proved by the pure Greek drachm of the Berlin Museum, coined exactly in the type and style of the Arsakeses, as discovered by me. . . . . . Sanabares must have produced his coins about 80 A.D., and Yndopheres had died at this date.\"1\n\nAccounts seem to agree that St. Thomas, if he was ever in the East, laboured among the Parthians, Medes, Persians, Carmenians, Hyrcanians, Bactrians and Margians,2 confining his sphere to N.W. India, or rather the borders of the Indus (at this time in possession of the Parthians). It was here we take it Calamina, the capital of the Ikshus, must be placed, and from them took its Greek name.\n\nWith regard to St. Thomas at Madras, the curious agreement of Bodhidharma's name, Ta-mo, who left that neighbourhood for China A.D. 516, would be sufficient to explain the stories about the Apostle having flourished in that neighbourhood, and having gone thence to China. This has been noticed by other writers; M. Margrot, Bishop of Conon, writes thus: \"One Tamo, as notorious a rogue as ever visited China, who became chief of one of the subdivisions of the sect of Foe, which they call the sect of the contemplatives, has been mistaken by the missionaries for St. Thomas.\"3\n\nThat Bodhidharma (Ta-mo) went to China, from South India, about the beginning of the sixth century, and became the first patriarch of the sect of Fo, in that country, admits of no question; but this cannot affect the tradition recorded by Eusebius and other early writers respecting the Apostle St. Thomas in Parthia, or his death at Calamina.4\n\n---\n\n1 Ind. Antiq. vol. ix. part cxi. p. 260.\n2 Compare Asseman. Bib. Orient. Tom. iii. part 2, p. 25, quoted by Hough, op. cit. p. 35 n.\n3 Hough, op. cit. vol. i. p. 94.\n4 I will here merely add the names of some of these writers: Origines (Lib. ii. in Genes.); Eusebius (Lib. iii. Histor. Eccl. cap. 1); Rufinus (Lib. i. cap. 9); Auctor libri Recognitionum (Lib. ix. c. 29); Socrates (Lib. i. cap. 15); aliquae, Parthiam Thomae obituisse scribunt; Persidem Fortunatus Parthiae substituit (Lik. i. Carm. 1) P\u00e1rtiam, Persidem et Indiam Thomae assignat Hippolytus.\nThere is some ground, therefore, for the belief that Calamina, where tradition states St. Thomas was martyred, was a town of Parthia, bordering on the Indus.\n\nA curious illustration of this point will be found in Josephus \"against Apion,\" where, in Whiston's translation, he is made to say that Aristotle told Clearchus that there was in India a sect from whom the Jews derived their name or their character. \"These Jews,\" he says, \"are derived from the Indian philosophers named by the Indians Calami, by the Syrians Judei.\"\u00b9\n\nThe texts, indeed, agree in giving \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 for \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9, and I am quite unable to state from what text Whiston translated (or whether my copy, the ordinary edition by Howell of Liverpool, is defective), but I am quite prepared to agree with Lassen in the Rhenish Museum (\"Indian Sects named by Greek Authors\") that the use of the word Kalanoi\u00b2 is the work of some sciolist, who had in his mind the name of Kalanus, who came to Alexander, and so coined the term of the Indian sect. I quite assent to that opinion, and I believe that the true reading should be Kalamoi. Were these Calami\u00b3 or Calani the holy tribe of the Ikshv\u0101kus of Potala?\n\nIn proof that the Ikshv\u0101kus of Potala were considered a holy or righteous tribe, I will only add two passages. In the Si-yu-ki\u2074 we are told that four of the \u015a\u0101kya youths were banished by their clansmen from Kapilavastu, because they had withstood the marauding force of Vir\u016bdhaka; such an act of violence was unworthy of a tribe in which a succession of holy kings had appeared; they ought rather \"patiently to\n\nLoca predicationis Sophronius apud Hieronymum sic recenset, 'Thomas Apostolus, quemmodum traditum est nobis, Parthis et Medis et Persis et Carminis et Hyrcanis et Bactris et Margis predicavit Evangelium Domini (Sophronius Cap. 8).' Given by the Rev. J. Hough, op. cit. vol. i. p. 35 n.\n\n\u00b9 Against Apion, Whiston, p. 640.\n\u00b2 There is however a Sanskrit word Kalana, as well as Kalama, signifying 'a reed,' or 'cane.' Cf. the word \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 applied to St. John the Baptist. The query is whether the term \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, like \u03ba\u03b1\u03b2\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2 among Christians, was applied to any one of a marked religious character.\n\u00b3 The Sanskrit Calama means both \"rice\" and \"a reed\"; the Calamus of Ezekiel (xxvii. 19) is the Hebrew Konch.\n\u2074 Jul. ii. p. 317.\nhave endured wrong, than bring disgrace upon their name by acting cruelly and revengefully.\"\n\nSo again, in the account of the banishment of the four \u015a\u0101kya princes from P\u014dtala, it is said,\u00b9 \"When they had proceeded sixteen miles from Benares, a council was called. The princes said, 'We have so large a retinue that there is no city in Jambudwipa that could withstand us; but if we were to seize on any kingdom by force, it would be unjust and contrary to the principles of the Okk\u0101ka (Ikshv\u0101ku) race: nor would it be consistent in us as princes to take that which belongs to another; we will therefore erect for ourselves a city in some unpeopled wild and reign in righteousness.'\"\n\nSuch principles as these seem to connect the Calani or Calami, named by Aristotle, with the Ikshv\u0101kus of P\u014dtala.\n\nIX. \u6b63\u89ba (Samyak Sambuddhi).\n\nThere are frequent allusions in the Si-yu-ki\u00b2 to the condition of Samyak Sambuddhi, which constitutes the condition of enlightenment peculiar to a Buddha.\n\nThe corresponding phrase in P\u0101li is Samm\u0101sambodhi, which Childers translates \"perfect knowledge of the truth.\"\u00b3 The Chinese symbol \u6b63 also implies perfection.\u2074 I do not profess to explain the radical force of sami-a\u015b\u0107, or sami-\u0101\u015b\u0107; but there seems to be a similarity, at least a verbal one, between Sambuddhi and \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b4\u03ae\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2. Perhaps this deserves some notice.\n\nThe Si-yu-ki states that Bodhisattva arrived at this condition of \"perfect enlightenment\" (samyak sambuddhi) under the sacred tree at Gay\u0101, in agreement with the general statement in other Buddhist books.\n\nThis condition of intellectual perfection is described thus in the Buddha-charita:\n\n\"That which behoves the world to learn, but through the\n\n\u00b9 Spence Hardy's Man. of Bud. pp. 131, 132.\n\u00b2 Jul. ii. pp. 309, 312, etc.\n\u00b3 P\u0101li Dict. s.v.

He had refused to argue, but self-reliant he stated his own independent superiority; he had reached himself, and by himself, enlightenment.\n\nI can hardly say whether this is not Stoicism pure and simple. \"Chrysippus, like other Stoics,\" says Dr. Lightfoot, \"had no belief in argumentation, but welcomed the highest truths as intuitively apprehended.\"\u00b2\n\nBuddha also asserted he had reached the highest truth intuitively. \"Self-taught in this profoundest doctrine, I have attained to that which man has not attained (intuitive truth).\"\u00b3\n\nAgain, Dr. Lightfoot observes: \"The Stoic being a Pantheist, and having no distinct belief in a personal God, was not a prophet in the ordinary sense, but only as being the exponent of his own inner consciousness, which was his supreme authority.\"\u2074\n\nAgain, \"The Stoic was essentially a philosopher of intuition.\"\u2075\n\nI need not dwell on the points of agreement between the two systems; they may be summed up as embracing (1) a common belief in the supreme good, derived from the practice of virtue, (2) the self-reliance and assertion of conscience, and (3) the reality of intuitional apprehension of truth.\n\nIt is singular that this agreement of thought should be supplemented by two striking historical facts. 1st, Zeno was a child of the East, a native of Citium, a Phoenician colony of Cyprus, and called \"the Phoenician.\" Dr. Lightfoot asserts that \"Stoicism was in fact the earliest offspring of the union between the religious consciousness of the East and the intellectual culture of the West.\"\u2076\n\n\u00b9 Fo-sho, etc. v. 1206.\n\u00b2 Lightfoot, Epist. to the Philippians, Excursus ii. p. 276.\n\u00b3 Fo-sho, p. 169, v. 1205.

To this fact may be attributed the intense moral earnestness which was its most honourable characteristic.\"\n\nDr. Lightfoot attributes the Eastern affinities to contact with the Jews, or Jewish schools. I should be inclined, in the presence of such marked resemblances of detail, and even of verbal similarities, to believe that Zeno, the Phoenician, was indebted for his inspiration to the further East.\n\nThe second historical fact is this, that the Antigonus Gonatas of Macedon of the Edicts of Asoka\\(^1\\) was the patron, if not disciple, of Zeno. Whilst residing at Athens he attended his lectures and earnestly invited him to his court. Was Antigonus entirely ignorant of the doctrine of Buddha, accepted and patronized by Asoka? At least it is strange that the same man named by Asoka in his edicts should be a follower of Zeno!\n\nOn all grounds I think the condition of Sambuddhi or Sambodhi, is allied to the \\(\\sigma\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2\\) of the Greek philosopher.\n\n**X. \u4e00\u5207\u7fa9\u6210**\n\nI may call attention to the Chinese rendering of the name Sarvarthasiddha, the secular appellative of the young prince who afterwards became the Buddha. This name is otherwise given as Siddh\u00e1rtha, and it is rendered into English by Prof. Max M\u00fcller,\\(^2\\) \"he by whom the end is accomplished,\" and by Prof. Monier Williams as \"one by whom all things are effected.\"\\(^3\\) I cannot say that either of these renderings agrees with the Chinese translation of the word. The translation as given in Si-yu-ki is Yih-tsai-i-shing,\\(^4\\) which is thus rendered by Dr. Eitel, \"the realization of all the meanings, sc. which were attributed to the various miracles that happened at the moment when \u015a\u0101kyamuni was born.\"\\(^5\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Edict xiii.

So that the Chinese phrase Yih-tai-i-shing may be rendered \"omni ratione perfectus\"; the symbol i corresponds with ratio, and it need not be confined to its common signification of \"reason\" or \"meaning\"; in this way it denotes \"perfection,\" both as to personal appearance and propitious circumstances. I should therefore simply translate Siddh\u0101rtha, by \"the perfect\" or \"the perfectly accomplished,\" or \"perfected with every excellency.\"\n\nThere is a curious illustration of this meaning of the word Siddh\u0101rtha in the Si-yu-ki. In the account given of a Master of \u015a\u0101stras called Bh\u0101vaviv\u0113ka, in the 10th book, it is stated that he was able by the recitation of some magic formula to enter a cave of an Asura, where he is now supposed to be, awaiting the arrival of Maitr\u0113ya. In the translation of Wong P\u016bh's life of Buddha, there is an account of this proceeding of Bh\u0101vaviv\u0113ka; we find that he repeated a magic formula called Kin-kong (i.e. the Diamond dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b), before the door of an Asura cavern, and then knocking at the rock it opened. But there is an expression used before the account of his knocking, which is the difficulty\u2014chiu pih kae tseu \"enchanting a white mustard seed,\" he knocked at the face of the rock; does this mean he enchanted the seed and then threw it against the rock? or does it mean he repeated his magic sentences (piril) to a mustard seed, i.e. perfectly (ad unguem)? It may mean, as Julien supposes, that the white mustard seed was enchanted, and I find, in confirmation of this, that, in the preface to the Liturgy of Kwan Yin, one of the directions for preparing the sacred precinct, or Mandala, is to take some white mustard seeds, and\n\n---\n\n1 Jul. iii. p. 115.\n2 Journal of the Royal Asiatic Soc.

Siddh\u0101rtha? Anyhow, the virtue of the white mustard seed is so great, that in the case of Bh\u0101vaviveka, the rock opened and the cave was freely entered.\n\nIt is possible that we have here the explanation of \u201cOpen Sesame\u201d in the tale of Ali Baba.\n\nBut to return to Siddh\u0101rtha, the prince. When his renown as \u201cpossessed of every perfection\u201d spread to Persia, it may have laid the foundation for the legends about the perfect knight Arthur (Siddh\u0101rtha), and his round table (chakra?). The story of the holy grail, at least, seems to be connected with the history of the P\u0101tra,\u00b2 and there are other particulars in the two legends which seem to be closely connected. Of these I will not speak here.\n\nXI. \u7d93\u8a31\u6469\u8a36\u5e1d\u7d93\n\nIt appears from the Si-yu-ki,\u00b3 that the majority of the Buddhists in the neighbourhood of the Sindhu province belonged to the school called Sammatiya; this was the case at Fa-la-pi (Vallabhi), Mo-la-po (M\u0101lava), \u0100nandapura, Sur\u0101sh\u1e6dra, Pit\u0101s\u012bla, Avan\u1e0da, and other countries.\n\nIn the Life of Buddha according to the Sammatiya school,\n\n\u00b9 Compare Colebrooke, Essays, \u00a7 iv. p. 93.\n\u00b2 With regard to this, I think Col. Yule was the first to point out the similarity of the story of the P\u0101tra and Holy Grail (Marco Polo, vol. ii. p. 266, 1st edition). In my Report on the Buddhist Tripitaka I called attention to the same circumstance, p. 114. I may now add that the Chinese equivalent for P\u0101tra, Ying k\u2019i \u2018a proper measure dish,\u2019 seems to agree with grail (graduale).\n\u00b3 Jul. iii. pp. 162, 180.\nwhich I apprehend is the same as the Chung-hu-mo-ho-ti-king,\\(^1\\) we have a lengthened account of the kings of P\u00f4tala (the Ikshv\u00e2kus), and the descent of \u015a\u00e2kya; this we should expect in a work belonging to a school so largely diffused in the region of the Indus, whose chief port was P\u00f4tala.\n\nBut there is an adventure recorded concerning the youthful Siddh\u00e2rtha in this book, which I have not found anywhere else. It occurs on the 17th page of the 4th kiouen, where we find him encountering a fiery dragon in the Lumbini garden. This poisonous beast dwelt in a cave near the river Lu-ho-ka (Ruhaku?), and by his noxious breath afflicted the people who were engaged in the attempt to remove a tree that had fallen across the stream and caused a drought. The young prince was summoned to assist them, and on his way through the garden the fiery dragon came forth from his den and disputed the way. On this the royal prince drew his sword and speedily killed him, whilst the poisonous vapour from his mouth spread around the spot. The dragon, because of his colour, was called K\u00e2lan\u00e2ya (Kia-lo-na-i) \u201cthe black worm.\u201d\n\nThis adventure with the dragon naturally brings to mind the legend of St. George and the Dragon.\n\nIn the first place St. George, according to one version of the legend, destroys a dragon who is guarding a spring of water, whilst the country is languishing for irrigation. \u201cSt. George, we are told, restores to the land the use of the spring by slaying the dragon.\u201d\\(^2\\)\n\nSecondly, the epithet \u201cSt. George the victorious\u201d is quite parallel to the accepted title of Buddha (or Bodhisattva in his contest with M\u00e2ra) as Jina, \u201cthe conqueror\u201d or \u201cvictorious\u201d; this epithet is applied to all the Buddhas in virtue of their conquest over M\u00e2ra.\n\nThirdly, there is an agreement in the seven years\u2019 torture which the Saint underwent at the hands of Dacian, Emperor\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mr. Nanjio (Catalogue, no. 859) gives another title to this S\u00fbtra. But, in the first Chapter of the original, Chung-Hu is made to represent Sammata, and I would suggest that Mo-ho-ti is Mah\u00e2t\u00ee (as in Mah\u00e2t\u00ee kath\u00e2), or simply Mah\u00e2t\u00ee S\u00fbtra.\n\n\\(^2\\) Myths of the Middle Ages, by S. Baring-Gould, p. 311.\nof the Persians, \"who was stirred up by the Devil,\" and the seven years' suffering of Bodhisattva ere he became a Jina by overcoming M\u00e2ra; \"for seven years M\u00e2ra (the devil) pursued the Bodhisattva up to the last vain attack he made upon him under the tree;\" here we have \"satta vasa\u00f1i,\" seven years, expressly named, and during all this time he was pursued by M\u00e2ra.\n\nBut the veneration paid by the Turks to St. George indicates a non-Christian element in the tradition. \"The Mussulmans say that El Khouder (Al Khedr) is not dead, but flies round and round the world, and that chapels are built wherever he appears.\" This sounds very much like a Buddhist myth; it occurs also in the Arthurian legend; the dish of Buddha, moreover, flies here and there, and shrines were raised to it.\n\nAl Khedr, the companion of Moses (according to the Mussulmans) is alluded to in the Coran (Surat lxxvi. 21), and elsewhere. He is believed to have been Phinehas, whose soul passed into Elias and thence into the \"sacred rider\" Girgis, or Jergis (St. George), after whom the bay of Beyrouth is named, where tradition says he met the dragon.\n\nThe term \"sacred rider\" would very appropriately belong to Bodhisattva mounted on his steed Kantaka. By referring to the beautiful central disc found on Plate xlix. Tree and Serpent Worship, 1st edition, this will be readily allowed. His sacred character as he rode forth is evidenced by the graceful light about his head, whilst round him angels (d\u00eavas) cluster, and support the horse's hoofs. This scene, it is well known, has given name to the history of Buddha called Abhinishkramana, and in the translation of that work from the Chinese, it has been placed on the cover of the book as the key to the whole story. The scene is found elsewhere, and I believe it forms part of the Lahore collec-\n\n1 Oldenberg, Buddha, p. 420.\n2 Stanley, Sinai and Palestine, p. 274.\n3 Each Tath\u00e2gata has a successor awaiting (in heaven) his time \"to come.\" Tath\u00e2gata therefore never dies.\n4 \"Arthur is come again; he cannot die.\"\u2014Tennyson, Morte d'Arthur.\n5 Also Pl. lix.\n6 The Romantic Legend of Buddha.\nI will give \u00c1\u015bvaghosha's account of this scene: \"The devas then gave spiritual strength; and unperceived the horse, equipped, came round with even pace; a gallant steed, with all his jewelled trappings for a rider. High-maned, with flowing tail, broad-backed, short-haired and eared, with belly like the deer's, head like the king of parrots, wide forehead, rounded claw-shaped nostrils; breath like the dragon's, with breast and shoulders square, true and sufficient marks of his high breed. The royal prince, stroking the horse's neck, and rubbing down his body, said: 'My royal father ever rode on thee, and found thee brave in fight and fearless of the foe; now I desire to rely on thee alike, to carry me far off,'\" etc. The account then proceeds: \"Having thus exhorted him, he bestrode his horse; grasping the reins, he rallied forth; the man, like the bright sun, the horse like the white floating cloud; . . . four spirits held the horse's feet; . . . thus man and horse went forward strong of heart, now lost to sight like streaming stars, but ere the eastern quarter flushed with light they had advanced three yojanas.\"\n\nThis scene, so famous and widespread, if applied to St. George, would well account for his name, \"the sacred rider.\"\n\nThe story of Yamb\u016bsh\u0101dh related in the book of Na-bath\u00e6an Agriculture, written by Kuth\u0101mi, the Babylonian, and translated by Ibn Wa'\u1e25shiya al Kasdani, who lived apparently at Bagdad about A.D. 900, is curiously parallel with the history of St. George, so much so that Mr. Baring-Gould says that the legends about Tammuz (with whom Yamb\u016bsh\u0101dh is associated) is but a heathen form of the history of St. George. But who then was Yamb\u016bsh\u0101dh? Kuth\u0101mi says: \"I believe in the story of Yamb\u016bsh\u0101dh, and when they read it and weep, I weep along with them, and the reason is this, that the time of Yamb\u016bsh\u0101dh is nearer to our own\n\n---\n\n1 So \"sacred\" was the group considered that at one time (by a stretch of fancy) it was confounded with the entrance of Christ into Jerusalem. See Dr. Leitner's Lecture on \"Greco-Buddhist Sculptures\" (quoted in The Hour, Feb. 27th, 1874).\n2 S.B.E. xix. p. 56.\n3 Baring-Gould, op. cit. pp. 233, 284.\nthan the time of Tammuz, and his story therefore is more certain and worthy of belief.\"\u00b9\n\nAnd then he observes: \"The contemporaries of Yamb\u00fbsh\u00e2dh assert that all the sek\u00e2'im of the gods and all the images lamented over Yamb\u00fbsh\u00e2dh after his death, just as the angels and the sek\u00e2'im lamented over Tammuz.\" So that, whoever Yamb\u00fbsh\u00e2dh was,\u00b2 one reason why St. George is associated with him seems to be on account of the weeping of the gods at his death. But this is also a particular connected with Buddha; was it not rather borrowed from his history and referred to St. George?\n\n\u00b3\"The sun and moon withdrew their shining; the peaceful streams on every side were torrent swollen: the sturdy forests shook like aspen leaves, whilst flowers and leaves untimely fell around, like scattered rain.\n\n\"The flying dragons, carried on pitchy clouds, wept down their tears; the four kings and their associates moved by pity, forgot their works of charity.\n\n\"The pure devas came from heaven to earth, etc.\"\n\nAnd so all accounts describe the circumstances of the Nirv\u00e2na.\n\nLastly, it is perhaps worth remarking that the story of St. George and the dragon first appeared in the Legenda Aurea of Jacobus de Voragine. It is to this legend we owe the revival of the story of St. Thomas and King Gondoforus, and the death of the Christian martyr at Calamina.\n\nIf the account of the Apostle's death was derived from traditions surviving at Potala\u2074 (Tatta), or the neighbourhood, we must also remember that it was in this neighbourhood the legendary history of Bodhisattva contained in the work named at the head of this section was widely circulated, and in this work is the account of the battle of the prince and the dragon, and the deliverance of the land from drought.\n\n\u00b9 op. cit. p. 280.\n\u00b2 Yamb\u00fbsh\u00e2dh was one of the three wise men (Ss\u00e2gr\u00eet, Yamb\u00fbsh\u00e2dh and Qut\u00e2m\u00e2), who wrote a work on Nabathean agriculture, he is supposed to have lived some 7000 years ago. It is an old Chaldean name.\u2014Dr. Malan (a private communication).\n\u00b3 Fo-sho, etc. S.B.E. xix. p. 308.\n\u2074 Calamina (?).\nXII. \u6469\u738b (M\u0101ra).\n\nThere is much said in the Si-yu-ki about M\u0101ra, the Tempter. The question is one of interest, what was the Buddhist conception of this \"author of evil\"? In any case he was not the lord of the \"under world,\" but rather the prince of the \"upper world.\" There are apparently two representations of him in the Sanchi sculptures: the first in pl. xxx., where he is represented as placed above the Tr\u0101yastri\u1e43\u015bas heaven, in which they are celebrating the festival of the chudam\u0101\u1e47i; supported by his wives (or daughters), he is regarding with dismay the determined purpose of the Bodhisattva to reach the condition of a Buddha. Secondly in pl. xxvi. fig. 1, where he is exhibited, with his five female attendants, as in the former plate, approaching Buddha for the purpose of dissuading him from continuing in the world \"a kalpa.\"\n\nThere is no sign in these plates of the idea of a degraded form of being; he was prince of the world of desire, the ruler of the K\u0101ma-loka, the personification of lust, of sin and death, the arch-enemy of all goodness, residing with legions of subordinates in the heaven Parinirmita Visavartin, situated on the top of the K\u0101ma-loka; he is also called \"the wicked one\" (P\u012b\u015buna), or \"sinful love\"; another name for him is \"the murderer.\"\n\nOne of his chief attributes is the power of fascination. He fascinated \u0100nanda so that he failed to ask Buddha to remain in the world a Kalpa. And he endeavoured to fascinate the Bodhisattva himself with thoughts of worldly power, and sensual love, but failed.\n\nThere is a curious passage in the Si-yu-ki, in the 7th book, p. 55, which seems to exhibit his character in this light, and which may perhaps help to explain the origin of the phrase \"night-mare.\"\n\n1st edition.\nEitel, Handbook, s.v. M\u0101ra.\n\u6ce2\u65ec.\n\u6bba\u8005.\nBeal's translation.\n\"To the east of the 'deer forest' 2 or 3 li, we come to a stupa by the side of which is a dry pool about 80 paces in circuit, one name of which is 'saving life,' another name is 'ardent master.' The old traditions explain it thus: Many hundred years ago there was a solitary sage (a sorrowful or obscure master) who built by the side of this pool a hut to live in, away from the world. He practised the arts of magic, and by the extremest exercise of his spiritual power he could change broken fragments of bricks into precious stones, and could also metamorphose both men and animals into other shapes, but he was not yet able to ride upon the winds and the clouds, and to follow the Rishis in mounting upwards. By inspecting figures and names that had come down from of old, he further sought into the secret arts of the Rishis. From these he learned the following: 'The spirit-Rishis are they who possess the art of lengthening life.' If you wish to acquire this knowledge, first of all you must fix your mind on this\u2014viz. to build up an altar enclosure 10 feet round; then command an \"ardent master\" (a hero), faithful and brave, and with clear intent, to hold in his hand a long sword and take his seat at the corner of the altar, to cover his breath, and remain silent from evening till dawn. He who seeks to be a Rishi must sit in the middle of the altar, and, grasping a long knife, must repeat the magic formul\u00e6 and keep watch (seeing and hearing). At morning light, attaining the condition of a Rishi, the sharp knife he holds will change into a sword of diamond (a gem-sword), and he will mount into the air and march through space, and rule over the band of Rishis. Waving the sword he holds, everything he wishes will be accomplished, and he will know neither decay nor old age,\n\n1 There is no expression for 'pool,' as in the French translation.\n2 The magic art of lengthening life, or of a long life. The 'elixir of life' and the art of transmuting metals had been sought after in the East long before the Arabs introduced the study of alchemy into Europe. The philosopher's stone is the tan sha of the Chinese, i.e. the red bisulphuret of mercury, or cinnabar. See an article on Taoism in the Trans. of the China Branch of the R.A.S., part v. 1865, article iv., by Dr. Edkins, p. 87.\n3 We may compare with this the ceremonies observed anciently on conferring the dignity of knighthood, especially the vigil before the altar. (Ingulphus, quoted by Mr. Thoms in his Book of the Court, p. 138.)\nnor disease nor death.' The man having thus obtained the method (of becoming a R\u016bshi), went in search of such an 'ardent master.' Diligently he searched for many years, but as yet he found not the object of his desires. At length, in a certain town, he encountered a man piteously wailing as he went along the way. The solitary master seeing his marks (the marks on his person), was rejoiced at heart, and forthwith approaching him, he inquired, 'Why do you go thus lamenting, and why are you so distressed?' He said, 'I was a poor and needy man, and had to labour hard to support myself. A certain master seeing this, and knowing me to be entirely trustworthy, used me (engaged me for his work) during five years, promising to pay me well for my pains. On this I patiently wrought in spite of weariness and difficulties. Just as the five years were done, one morning for some little fault I was cruelly whipped and driven away without a farthing. For this cause I am sad at heart and afflicted. Oh, who will pity me?'\n\n\"The solitary master ordered him to accompany him, and coming to his cabin (wood hut), by his magic power he caused to appear some choice food, and ordered him to enter the pool and wash. Then he clothed him in new garments, and giving him 500 gold pieces, he dismissed him, saying, 'When this is done, come and ask for more without fear.' After this he frequently bestowed on him more gifts, and in secret did him other good, so that his heart was filled with gratitude. Then the 'ardent master' was ready to lay down his life in return for all the kindness he had received. Knowing this, the other said to him, 'I am in need of an enthusiastic person.' During a succession of years I sought for one, till I was fortunate enough to meet with you,\n\n1 The account of this magic gem-sword may be compared with the 'great brand, Excalibur,' of King Arthur:\n   'But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm\n    Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,\n    And caught him by the hilt, and brandished him\n    Three times.' \u2014Tennyson.\n\n2 Siang, the marks indicating his noble character.\n\n3 Wu-wai may also mean 'seek it not elsewhere.'

So Julien translates; but \\textit{fi yau ta} would more naturally be rendered 'unlike that of any other.'} Now, therefore, I pray you, during one night (to watch) without speaking a word.\n\n\"The champion said, 'I am ready to die for you, much more to sit with my breath covered.'\\footnote{From this it seems that the portion relating to 'holding the breath' is omitted in the previous sentence.} Whereupon he constructed an altar and undertook the rules for becoming a Rishi, according to the prescribed form. Sitting down, he awaited the night. At the approach of night each attended to his particular duties. The 'solitary master' recited his magic prayers; the champion held his sharp sword in his hand. About dawn suddenly he uttered a short cry, and at the same time fire descended from heaven, and flames and smoke arose on every side like clouds. The 'solitary master' at once drew the champion into the lake,\\footnote{That is, to escape the fire.} and having saved him from his danger, he said, 'I bound you to silence; why then did you cry out?'\n\n\"The champion said, 'After receiving your orders, towards the middle of the night, darkly, as in a dream, the scene changed, and I saw rise before me all my past history. My master\\footnote{That is, 'my lord or master whom I now serve'\u2014the solitary master or Rishi. It cannot be my old master, the one who treated him so cruelly (as Julien construes it), for he comes on the scene in the next sentence. The symbols \\textit{sih see} are not to be taken with \\textit{chu}, as though it were 'my old master'; but with \\textit{kin}, as I have translated it, 'there arose before me the former events of my life.'} in his own person came to me, and in consolatory words addressed me; overcome with gratitude, I yet restrained myself and spoke not. Then that other man came before me; towering with rage, he slew me, and I received my ghostly body\\footnote{This ghostly body or shade (\\textit{chung yin shan}) corresponds with the \\textit{e\\textbf{\\textit{\\textsc{b}}}\\textit{e\\textbf{\\textit{\\textsc{l}}}\\textit{e\\textbf{\\textit{\\textsc{o}}}\\textit{w}}\\textit{a\\textbf{\\textit{\\textsc{o}}}}} of the Greeks\u2014\\textit{\u03a8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b5\u1f34\u03b2\u03c9\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78\u03c1 \u03c6\u03c1\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f10\u03bd\u03b9 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd.\u2014Iliad, xxiii. 104.}} (I wandered as a shade or shadowy body). I beheld myself dead, and I sighed with pain, but yet I vowed through endless ages not to speak, in gratitude to you. Next I saw myself destined to be born in a great...\"\nBrahman's house in Southern India, and I felt my time come to be conceived and to be brought forth. Though all along enduring anguish, yet from gratitude to you no sound escaped me. After awhile I entered on my studies, took the cap (of manhood), and I married; my parents dead, I had a child. Each day I thought of all your kindness, and endured in silence, uttering no word. My household connections and clan relatives all seeing this were filled with shame. For more than sixty years and five I lived. At length my wife addressed me, \"You must speak; if not, I slay your son!\" And then I thought, \"I can beget no other child, for I am old and feeble; this is my only tender son.\" It was to stop my wife from killing him I raised the cry.\n\n\"The solitary master\" said, 'All was my fault; 'twas the fascination of the devil.' The champion, moved with gratitude, and sad because the thing had failed, fretted himself and died. Because he escaped the calamity of fire, the lake is called 'Saving the Life,' and because he died overpowered by gratitude, it has its other name, 'The Champion's Lake.'\"\n\nP.S. After this paper was written and corrected, I was enabled, by the kindness of Mr. Vaux, to compare my remarks on the Yue-chi with the investigations of M. Specht (Journ. Asiatique, S\u00e9rie viii. Tome ii. pp. 319 seq.). I am gratified to find his opinion bears me out, so far as the Ye-tha are concerned. I wish to call attention to the M\u00e6so-Gothic words maija (greater) and minniya (less), and to suggest that we have here the origin of the names Massagetae, and the Mins, the ta Yue-chi (great Yue-chi) and the siau Yue-chi (little Yue-chi). I wish also, in reference to the name Al-Khedr, or Kh\u00fbder, to point out the curious coincidence between this Arabic name for St.\n\n1 Or M\u0101ra: it is plain that this weird story, taken in connection with the dream, the inability to move or speak, and the actual reference of it all to M\u0101ra, is but an account of \"the enthusiastic hero's\" suffering from \"nightmare.\"\nGeorge, and the Chinese \u9806, the common mode of representing the Sanskrit G\u00f4tama, i.e. Buddha.

So that the sound of the two would be Kiu dhar, i.e. Kh\u00fbder, or St. George.\nART. XIII.\u2014On the Sites of Brahmanabad and Mansurah in Sindh; with Notices of others of less note in their Vicinity.\n\nBy Major-General M. R. Haig, M.R.A.S.\n\nNotwithstanding the labours of the various authorities who have from time to time written upon the ancient topography of the lower Indus Valley, the subject remains in much need of further investigation. Attempts to identify places mentioned by the historians of Alexander's Expedition, by the author of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, the geographer Ptolemy, the Chinese pilgrim Hiouen Thsang, the historians of the Arab conquest, and by later writers, have not usually been attended with the happiest results. Nor, when the difficulties which beset investigation are considered, is it at all surprising that this should be so. It is hard enough to have to contend with the vagueness, inconsistencies and contradictions of old writers; but these are as nothing compared with the obstacles which the physical characteristics of the country itself oppose to the inquirer. For ages the Indus has been pushing its bed across the valley from east to west, generally by the gradual process of erosion, which effectually wipes out every trace of town and village on its banks; but, at times also, by a more or less sudden shifting of its waters into entirely new channels, leaving large tracts of country to go to waste, and forcing the inhabitants of many a populous place to abandon their old homes, and follow the river in search of new settlements. In course of time the forsaken channels are, in some parts wholly, in others partially, filled up by the action of the dust-laden winds that prevail for many months during the hot season, so as to leave but the vaguest traces of a former river-bed; or, perhaps, the retiring stream will leave behind\nit vast quantities of drift-sand which is swept by the high winds over the surrounding country, completely burying the sites of the abandoned towns, and transforming the once fertile fields into a blank waste of sand-hills where the explorer may search in vain for any record of the past.\n\nHaving had, as an inquirer, experience of the difficulties here described, and knowing the errors which even eminent authorities have not been able to avoid, I am bound, in attempting to throw some additional light on a very interesting portion of the ancient topography of Sindh, to admit that I am very far from feeling any undue confidence in the soundness of my conclusions. The most I can hope for is that the views submitted in this paper may attract the compliment of criticism, and so give rise to further and more satisfactory investigation.\n\nBrahman\u00e1b\u00e1d was probably one of the oldest cities in India; and, whether or not there is sufficient ground for regarding it as \"the city of the Brahmans,\" which played its part in the events of Alexander's Expedition, the Harmatelia of Diodorus, as Gen. Cunningham thinks,\u00b9 there can be little doubt that it was then in existence. The fame of great antiquity attached to it at the time of the Arab conquest, and the historian Bil\u00e1dh\u00far\u00ed, writing a thousand years ago, calls it \"Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d-al-a'tiqah,\" \"Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d the ancient.\"\n\nThe neighbouring fortress of Mans\u00farah was but short-lived in comparison, but it possesses historical interest from the fact of its having been the Arab capital, and, so far as we know, the first important stronghold built by Muslims in India.\n\nSir Henry Elliot's identification of Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d with the modern Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d was unfortunate. There is really nothing to support it, and the evidence against it is overwhelming and conclusive. It was an unlucky circumstance that, several identifications being to some extent dependent on that of Ner\u00fan, Sir Henry fell into a mistake regarding this place. No fact is more certain than that the present fort of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d occupies the site of Ner\u00fan, and Sir Henry\n\n\u00b9 Ancient Geography of India, p. 288.\nwould have had no difficulty in admitting it, but for one obstacle that seemed insurmountable. Ner\u00fan was certainly west of the river, and Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d is unquestionably east of it. He was not aware that the Indus had changed its course about the middle of last century, from the east to the west of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nBy others it has been supposed that the question of the site of Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d was settled by the labours of the late Mr. Bellasis, of the Bombay Civil Service, who, in 1854 and subsequent years, carried out some excavations in the ruins situated in the Shahdadpur Parganah, which go by the name of Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d. The result of his operations was to lead Mr. Bellasis to believe that these ruins were indeed the remains of the ancient city. His published accounts of the matter, as well as those of Col. Sykes, are extremely interesting, if not entirely convincing. Here it will be sufficient to say that a large number of coins found in the ruins were submitted to Mr. Thomas, who, from an examination of them, formed the opinion that the identification of the ruined site with Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d was questionable. This opinion is confirmed by the results of my own study of the question and observation of the locality.\n\nIn one of his interesting papers on Sindh, published in the first volume of this Society's Journal, Captain McMurdo, after describing the situation of Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d, says (p. 232), \"Bhamana\" was afterwards called D\u00edbal K\u00e1ngara.\" I have not been able to discover his authority for this statement, but I conclude it was some local history which I have not been fortunate enough to meet with. If his statement is correct, the site of Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d is at once ascertained. Not \"Dibal K\u00e1ngara,\" but \"Dep\u00e1l G\u00e1ngrah\" is to be read. Capt. McMurdo found it written \u062f\u06cc\u0628\u0627\u0644 \u06a9\u0627\u0646\u06af\u0631\u06c1, and, naturally enough, trans-\n\n---\n\n1 See History of India, vol. i. Appendix, s.r.

Buhmanah is the name in vogue among Sindhis.\nliterated it as above. The place is frequently mentioned in the local histories, and it must have been of some little importance, as it gave its name to the Parganah\u2014or part of the Parganah\u2014which in recent times has been called Shahdadpur, from a town founded by Mir Shahdad, one of the first chiefs of the Talpur family. Depal Gangrah was probably some petty Rajput chief. Nothing is known of him, but his name survives under the modified form of Depar (\u062f\u067e\u0627\u0631) Gangro, and it pertains to a ruinous site of considerable area, and apparently of great antiquity, the crumbling remnants of houses, walls and bastions having been worn down nearly to the level of the surrounding country. Here, then, if Captain McMurdo's authority may be trusted, is the site of Brahmanabad, and if so, then the ruins now bearing that name are almost certainly those of the Arab capital, Mansurah. For convenience sake I shall so far assume these identifications to be made out as to name each site in accordance with them in the further discussion of the question.\n\nThe exact positions are\n\nBrahmanabad ... ... 25\u00b0 56' N. 68\u00b0 54' E.\nMansurah ... ... ... 25\u00b0 53' N. 68\u00b0 49' E.\n\nMansurah is ten miles E. by S. from Shahdadpur, and Brahmanabad is six miles and a half N.E. from Mansurah, both measurements being in a direct line. The distance between the two sites is thus in agreement with that stated by Biladhuri, namely, two farsakhs. General Cunningham considers the O-fan-cha of Hiouen Thsang to be Brahmanabad, and Pi-ta-si-lo to be Nerun. According to the Pilgrim the distance between the two places was 300 li, or 50 miles, O-fan-cha bearing N.E. The Brahmanabad of this article is 49 miles, in a direct line, N.E. from Haidarabad. Abu-l-fida quotes a writer named Muhalabi to the effect that Mansurah was fifteen farsakhs from Nerun. The Mansurah of this article is a little under forty-four miles in a direct line from Haiderabad. Idrisi says that Mansurah was \"rather more than three days' journey\" from Nerun, but he\n\n1 He took great pains to collect local histories and acquire correct information, but never was in Sindh, and doubtless never heard of a place which in modern times has sunk into obscurity.\nputs the distance from Ner\u00fan to Debal at three days, and Ibn Haukal, from personal observation, states that Ner\u00fan was nearer to Mans\u00farah than to Debal. At the present day, by the most direct route, via Nasrpur, English officials do the distance in three journeys, averaging sixteen to seventeen miles. Thus, as regards distance between given points, the proposed identifications are quite consistent with the data supplied by old writers. Further evidence may be derived from the Chach Namah, a chronicle which treats of events prior to the founding of Mans\u00farah.\n\nAfter relating the capture of the fort of Dhalil, the last of the strong places taken by the Arab army before reaching Brahman\u00e1b\u00e9d, the historian says: \"Some relate that when Dhalil was captured, Muhammad K\u00e1sim called for N\u00fabah, son of Dh\u00e1ran, and, after giving him strict injunctions, entrusted to him the charge of the business of the boats, along the bank of the river, from that point to a place called D\u00fah\u00e1ti, and from that place to Brahman\u00e1b\u00e9d there was a space of one farsang.\"\u00b9\n\nThere is no place in the neighbourhood of Brahman\u00e1b\u00e9d called D\u00fah\u00e1ti, but there is a township named D\u00faf\u00e1n\u00ed, and this I have no doubt is the name intended. A glance at the two names written in Persian shows how easily one might be substituted for the other by a copyist, \u062f\u0648\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc for \u062f\u0648\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u060c in consequence of the dot of the \u062f in the latter word having been placed too close\u2014perhaps joined\u2014to the \u062f, and an extra dot given to the penultimate letter. The township of D\u00faf\u00e1n\u00ed is two miles and a half S.W. from Brahman\u00e1b\u00e9d, and by writers who never employ a fraction this distance would be called a farsang. Now the Arabs were advancing from south to north, and while it would be intelligible that the commander should assign to one of his officers the duty of watching the communication by river up to D\u00faf\u00e1n\u00ed, if that place were short of\u2014that is, south of\u2014Brahman\u00e1b\u00e9d,\n\n\u00b9 I have translated this from the copy belonging to the India Office Library. Sir H. Elliot's copy appears to have been defective at this place, and his translation would make it appear that Dhalil was a farsang from Brahman\u00e1b\u00e9d, while the general tenour of the narrative shows that it was at some distance from that place. See his Hist., vol. i. p. 176.\nit would have been a useless and absurd proceeding on his part if D\u00faf\u00e1n\u00ed had been some way beyond the great fortress, held, as we are told it was, by a strong garrison. D\u00faf\u00e1n\u00ed is four miles N.W. of the place popularly supposed to be the site of Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d, but which I believe to be that of Mans\u00farah.\n\nAnother piece of indirect evidence from the Chach N\u00e1mah. It states that when the Arab army left Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d, its first march was to a place called Mathal (\u0645\u0627\u062b\u0627\u0644). We are told that it was advancing towards the capital, Alor, by way of the districts of the Saht\u00e1 and Sam\u00e1, that is, through the modern Parganah of Naushahra, in which the Saht\u00e1 have had their home from time immemorial. This lies N.W. from Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d, but it would doubtless be an object to strike the main stream, then flowing in the Luh\u00e1no (see sketch-map), as soon as possible, consequently the first two marches would be nearly due westward. Now, a little short of seven miles west by south from Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d, there is a township called Mutahlo (in Persian written \u0645\u0637\u0647), which is most probably the place referred to. The march would be a short one, but this is just what we should expect in the case of an army breaking ground after a detention of many months at Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d. On the other hand, if the site I assume to be that of Mans\u00farah is really that of Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d, the march would be little more than two miles (Mutahlo is two miles and a quarter N.W. from Mans\u00farah), and so short a move is highly improbable.\n\nFrom the account given by the Chach N\u00e1mah it appears that Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d was on the west side of a stream called the Jalw\u00e1li. It is stated that \u201cMuhammad K\u00e1sim marched from Dhalil, and halted on the bank of the river Jalw\u00e1li (\u0646\u0647\u0631 \u062c\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0644\u064a) on the east of Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d,\u201d whence he sent to summon the town. Most probably this was a stream coming from the branch of the Indus now known as the \u201cEastern N\u00e1rah.\u201d Portions of a channel which left the Eastern N\u00e1rah about twenty-one miles N.E. from Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d, and took a south-westerly course, are yet to be seen between Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d and Mans\u00farah. These I conjecture to be the remains of the Jalw\u00e1li channel.\nHere we may inquire what led to the ruin of Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d? All that we know is that when Bil\u00e1dh\u00far\u00ed wrote his \"Futuh-us-Sindh\"\u2014perhaps about 870 to 880 A.D.\u2014Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d was in ruins, for so he says shortly, and without a word as to the cause of such a calamity. The Arabs, it must be remembered, destroyed none of the places which they captured. Each fortress, as it was taken, received an Arab governor and garrison, and became a centre of civil administration of the kind understood by Arabs, that is to say, a place for the reception of the tribute due from the surrounding district. Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d was thus treated, but the complete submission of the people on their first experience of Arab prowess was of no long duration, and within two years the native prince, Jesiyah (or Jai Sinh), son of D\u00e1hir, had re-occupied the town and expelled the foreigners. This prince soon afterwards became a Muslim, and he appears to have been allowed by the Khalifah to retain some kind of regal authority, but he was eventually killed in an action with the forces of the Arab governor, who evidently could not brook a rival. The prince's brother was a little later treacherously murdered by the same governor, and with him the native dynasty seems to have ended.\u00b9 But the struggle\n\n\u00b9 Bil\u00e1dh\u00far\u00ed calls this prince Sasah (\u0635\u0635), which is the Arabic transliteration of Chach. He must have been so named after his famous grandfather, the founder of the Brahman dynasty. According to Ibn Khallikan, he was the inventor of Chess (Elliot, Hist. vol. i. p. 499). Sir Henry Elliot had evidently forgotten what Bil\u00e1dh\u00far\u00ed shows to have been the fact, that there was really a \"Chach son of D\u00e1hir,\" as stated by Ibn Khallikan, and he thought that it must have been Chach, the first Brahman prince, who invented the game. On this point I may observe that, whoever invented the game of Chess, prince D\u00e1hir, if we may credit the Chach N\u00e1mah, certainly played it, and was much too fond of it. In that chronicle we are told that when the Arabs were preparing to cross the Indus to attack him, D\u00e1hir manifested the utmost indifference to the peril of his situation, so that at last a \"Samani\" made bold to remonstrate, and roundly charged him with spending his whole time in hunting and Chess when the enemy were almost at the gates. The passage is not among the extracts translated by Sir H. Elliot. It is as follows:\n\n\u0633\u0645\u06cc \u0628\u0646\u0632\u06cc\u06a9 \u062f\u0627\u0647\u0631\u0622\u0645\u062f \u0648\u06af\u0641\u062a \u0627\u06cc \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u062a\u0631\u0627\u0647\u0645 \u0631\u0648\u0632 \u0628\u0633\u06cc\u062f \u0648\u0627\u062c\u0628 \u0645\u0634\u063a\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0628\u06cc\u0646\u0645 \u0648\u062f\u0631 \u0634\u0637\u0631\u0646\u062c \u0648\u0646\u0631\u062f \u0628\u0627\u0632\u06cc \u0645\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0634\u06a9\u0631 \u0639\u0631\u0628 \u0631\u0633\u06cc\u062f \u0648\u0628\u0631\u062f\u0644 \u062a\u0648 \u0646\u0632\u0644 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646\u062f\n\nAmong the relics exhumed by Mr. Bellasis from the ruins of the so-called Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d was a set of ivory chess-men.\nfor national independence continued, and it would seem that Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d was never recovered by the Arabs, who, during the reign of the Khal\u00edfah Hisham (723\u2013742 A.D.), had to construct, first, the fortress which they named \"Al-Mah-f\u00fadhah,\" and, afterwards, the more celebrated \"Mans\u00farah,\" as places of refuge in the midst of the rebellious Sindhians. From this time nothing more is heard of Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d. Its name, linked to that of the neighbouring Arab fortress, long survived the ruins of the ancient city, and even at last extinguished the proud title given by the conquerors to their capital. Bahmanah-Mans\u00farah in process of time became Bahmanah only, and at this day no native of Sindh has any notion where Mans\u00farah stood: very few are aware that such a place ever existed.\n\nWhat had happened between the founding of Mans\u00farah and the period at which Bil\u00e1dh\u00far\u00ed wrote\u2014an interval of about 150 years\u2014to bring about the ruin of Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d? The stale fiction of wicked prince Dal\u00fa R\u00e1i and the earthquake has been current for centuries, and has amply satisfied all popular curiosity on the subject. If it were thought worth while to examine a story of such suspicious appearance, it would suffice to observe that an earthquake violent enough to have totally wrecked Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d must have done as much for Mans\u00farah. A more prosaic and much more probable cause may be suggested, namely, the failure of the stream on which the city stood. This would do the work of desolation quite as effectually, though less cruelly than it would be done by an earthquake. A similar catastrophe befell Alor, the capital, and there is no reason to seek further for an explanation of the ruin of Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d. Both calamities, indeed, may have happened simultaneously, in consequence of a sudden change in the course of the Indus above Alor, resulting in the main body of water being forced some distance westward, and the N\u00e1rah and Alor channels being left dry.\n\nLet us now turn to Mans\u00farah. Bil\u00e1dh\u00far\u00ed says this city was built by A\u2018mr\u00fa, a son of Muhammad K\u00e1sim, the conqueror of Sindh. Its site is described as \"on this (the west)\"\nside of the buhairah\u201d (\u0628\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064f\u062d\u0652\u0631). A little before it has been said that Mahf\u00fadhah was built on the \u201cfar side of the buhairah\u201d (\u0628\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064f\u062d\u0652\u0631). \u201cBuhairah\u201d is properly \u201ca lake,\u201d but there is no appearance of a lake having ever existed in the surrounding country, and it is probable that what was intended was some old river-channel containing standing water, a common enough feature in Sindh landscapes. Now, at Mutahlo (close to Mans\u00farah) there was, according to the Chach N\u00e1mah, \u201ca delightful piece of water\u201d (\u0622\u0628\u0650\u064a) called a \u2018dhandh,\u2019\u201d on the banks of which the Arabs encamped. Dhandh is the Sindhi word for such a pool as I have above described, and it seems probable that Bil\u00e1dh\u00fari and the Chach N\u00e1mah refer to the same piece of water. On the bank of this Mans\u00farah was built, and at a later period the hollow was no doubt connected with the river (in the Luh\u00e1no channel) by means of a canal, for the Arab Geographers describe Mans\u00farah as encircled by a canal (Khaliij) from the M\u00edhr\u00e1n, so as to make the land in which it stood an island. Of this canal there is now no trace, except at Mans\u00farah itself, where, on the north side of the ruined fortress, the channel is plainly distinguished. Standing at the north-west angle of the fortifications, one can just see that the channel came from the direction of Mutahlo, though at this point the trace northward gradually fades and disappears.\n\nThe old fortress itself is in a better state of preservation than would be expected, considering that its abandonment dates back several hundreds of years. The curtain and bastions are clearly traceable in their entire extent, rising to a height of thirty to forty feet above the level of the surrounding country. There appears to have been an inner citadel, and the whole interior area is a mass of brick heaps, the remains of dwellings which must have held a large population. To the south-east of the fortress, at the distance of about a mile, are the remains of a smaller stronghold, which may have been the Al-Mahf\u00fadhah which was the predecessor of Mans\u00farah. The country to the north and east of these sites, for a distance of a mile and a half, is\ncovered with the ruins of small forts and dwellings.\\(^1\\) Here no doubt, in those unquiet times, many thousands of traders and peasantry gathered for safety, under the shadow of the great fortress. Of the later history of Mans\u00farah little is known, and of the cause of its abandonment nothing. It appears to have been at the height of its prosperity in the tenth century, when it was visited by M\u00e1s\u00fadi, Istakhr\u00ed and Ibn Haukal. From the commencement of Arab dominion in Sindh, that country, separated by so many leagues of sea, and such vast deserts, from the central power of Isl\u00e1m, became a convenient refuge for the rebellious and the unorthodox subjects of the Khal\u00edfah. In the early part of the eleventh century, when Mahm\u00fad passed through Sindh on his return from the Somn\u00e1th expedition, a Karmat\u00ed was ruler in Mans\u00farah, and was deposed by the strictly orthodox Ghaznavide. This is among the latest authentic particulars we have of the Arab capital. If M\u00edr M\u2019as\u00fam, the historian of Sindh, is correct in his statement that the rule of the S\u00famr\u00e1h chiefs in lower Sindh dates from the reign of Mahm\u00fad\u2019s son \u2018Abd-ur-Rash\u00edd (1049\u20131051 A.D.), Mans\u00farah can, by this time, have no longer had a title to be regarded as the capital. The events, indeed, of the reigns of Mahm\u00fad and his successors caused the political current which had hitherto flowed from \u2018Ir\u00e1k to set in strongly from the north, and Bhakar, which the restless river had now encircled with its waters, and made a position of great natural strength, supplanted the Arab fortress. By 1203 A.D., when N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn Kub\u00e1chah took possession of Sindh, Mans\u00farah had become a place of secondary importance, and was perhaps merely the principal town of a small surrounding district. Its final abandonment I should conjecture to have been occasioned by the drying-up of the Luh\u00e1no channel, the date of which event is unknown. The failure of this channel would render it quite impossible for a large population to occupy any longer the position of Mans\u00farah and its\n\n\\(^1\\) It is possible that Al-Mahsf\u00fadhah occupied a position opposite the northern face of Mans\u00farah. It seems to have been a mere temporary place of refuge, and was doubtless small and poorly fortified.\nenvirons. At the present day, though this part of the country is well fertilized by inundation-canals, the supply of water is very scanty during half the year, and, as a consequence, the tract is but thinly populated. It is popularly believed that the fortress was destroyed by an earthquake, and, indeed, Mr. Bellasis, during his excavations, found evidence of such a catastrophe. It is not unlikely that portions of the town may have been destroyed in this way. The fortifications cannot have suffered materially, their present condition appearing to be rather the result of the wear and tear of time than the consequence of a convulsion of nature. An earthquake may indeed have caused the shifting of the Indus from the Luh\u00e1no to a new channel. A similar occurrence took place in 1819, when the earthquake, the central force of which was experienced with such terrible results in Kach, occasioned the abandonment of the branch of the Indus running by Sh\u00e1hbandar. The injury caused by earthquake is in time repaired, but the deprivation of water is irremediable, and in such a case a population has no choice between perishing and migrating. I think, then, that the drying up of the Luh\u00e1no channel was the effectual cause of the ruin of Mans\u00far.\n\nThe mention of earthquake recalls the legend of Dal\u00fa Rai. The name of this semi-mythical prince cleaves to nearly every ruined site in Sindh, and a \"mound of Dal\u00fa Rai\" is met at every turn in the neighbourhood of Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d and Mans\u00farah. It is said that after his sins had brought about the ruin of Alor, he transferred his residence and his vices to Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d, and eventually caused the destruction of his second capital. The earthquake, as we know, is a terribly stale ingredient in the legends of ruined towns, though here there may be a slight foundation of fact for that part of the story. But the character of Dal\u00fa Rai seems to me susceptible of rehabilitation. That such a prince lived, and acquired wide-spread fame, good or bad, cannot be doubted. It is a misfortune that he is unknown to authentic history. Some conjecture that he lived in the early days of Arab rule; others would put him so late as the time of 'Ala-\nud-d\u00edn Khalj\u00ed of Delhi (end of the thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth century). What is certain is that the common stories about him are of Muslim origin, and I am disposed to infer that Dal\u00fa R\u00e1\u00ed headed some of the popular risings against the Muslim rulers, and to conjecture that in the obloquy which has been heaped on his name, we may perhaps have a measure of the prince's patriotism and success. Such a treatment of history would be quite in accordance with the methods of Muslim chroniclers, with whom the credit of Isl\u00e1m is the first consideration, and the interests of truth of secondary importance, and it is allowable, I think, to interpret the legend of Dal\u00fa Rai in the light afforded by our knowledge of these tendencies.\n\nLeaving the twilight of legend and conjecture, I may pass on to the mention of another identification of some interest, which I think offers fair ground for acceptance. I refer to the site of S\u00e1wand\u00ed. This place is mentioned in the legends of the \"Mujmal-al-taw\u00e1r\u00edkh,\" as having been built by the King of Kashm\u00edr during an expedition to Sindh. The legend is full of absurdities, but we may perhaps safely infer from it the antiquity of S\u00e1wand\u00ed. It is twice mentioned in the Chach N\u00e1mah. On the first occasion it is stated that after the capture of Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d (about the middle of the seventh century), Chach paid a visit to a Buddhist devotee of great reputation, who lived a little way from that town. The devotee, after declining the prince's offer of high dignity in the State, went on to observe: \"As your mind is inclined to charitable deeds and the promotion of beneficent works, there is the temple and monastery of S\u00e1wand\u00e1s\u00ed\u2014an ancient place of worship\u2014in which for some time a breach has appeared due to the wear of time. It ought to be repaired,\" etc. We may suppose that the buildings in which the devotee was interested were somewhere in the neighbourhood of his residence, and therefore not far from Brahman\u00e1b\u00e1d. Now the Mathal which I have identified with Mutahlo is described as being \"in the environs of S\u00e1wand\u00ed,\" and near Mutahlo (about a mile east of it), there is a mound, perhaps a square mile in area, evidently the site of some long ruined\ntown. This I take to be the site of S\u00e1wand\u00ed, and I would suggest that S\u00e1wand\u00ed may be the O-fan-cha of Hiouen Thsang, which Stanislas Julien renders by Aranda. As the pilgrim cared for nothing but what was Buddhist, he would be more likely to visit a town containing at least one ancient temple and monastery, than one abounding with Brahman abominations.\\(^1\\) The distance from Pi-ta-shi-lo\u2014if that represents Ner\u00fan\u2014suits quite well. In a direct line it is forty-five miles, but, as the pilgrim travelled, it would be over fifty miles. At the conquest S\u00e1wand\u00ed received an Arab Governor. Nothing more is said of it.\n\nIn the accompanying sketch-map, the line which I conjecture the Mans\u00farah canal (Khalij) to have taken is shown to leave the Luh\u00e1no channel about twenty miles N.W. from Mansur\u00e1h. At this point there is a township called Kalro, which extends for a few miles east and west of the Luh\u00e1no. Idrisi says that at one day\u2019s distance from Mans\u00farah, at a place called K\u00e1lari, the river sent off a branch to Mans\u00farah. This place may have been in the township above mentioned, but the names given by the old geographers are evidently terribly corrupted, and identifications based on them can hardly be satisfactory.\n\nOne other place in this neighbourhood I mention for the purpose of pointing out a mistake made by others regarding it. This is Manj\u00e1bar\u00ed. I am not able to identify this place with any existing site; but we have two indications from the Arab geographers which will guide us to its situation approximately. Ibn Haukal says it was west of the Mihr\u00e1n, and opposite to Mans\u00far, at the point where travellers to the latter city from Debal crossed the river (Elliot, vol. i. p. 37). Idrisi says the distance from Sharus\u00e1n (Sehwan) to Manh\u00e1bari (Manj\u00e1bar\u00ed) was three days\u2019 journey (ibid. pp. 79, 80). A point opposite to Mans\u00farah is about sixty to sixty-four miles from Sehwan, so there can be no doubt that the site may be fixed within a short distance of accuracy. But Idrisi goes on to say that Manh\u00e1bari is\n\n\\(^1\\) General Cunningham, it will be remembered, considers O-fan-cha to be Brahman\u00e1b\u00e9d.\nonly two days from Debal, whereas, by his own statement of the distance from Sehwan to Manh\u00e1bar\u00ed, the latter could not have been less than five or six days from Debal. The fact is, as will be seen by comparing the account of the different geographers, there were two places of this name, or, at least, nearly similar in name, and the geographers got confused about them. There was the town above described, and another (sometimes called Manh\u00e1tar), two days west of Debal, on the road to Makr\u00e1n. Idr\u00eds\u00ed himself says: \"In going from Debal to Firabuz (in Makr\u00e1n) the road passes by Manh\u00e1bar\u00ed.\" This settles the question, but General Cunningham, misled by the confusion of the geographers, has identified Manh\u00e1bar\u00ed with Thatha, and he considers, too, that it was probably the Indo-Scythian capital Minnagar. If he were again examining the question, he would doubtless admit that this identification cannot stand.\n\nI have only further to point out that in the sketch-map there will be noticed the traces of a channel taking a south-easterly course, that apparently came from Mans\u00farah. I have not myself seen this remnant of an old branch of the river, but it is shown in the Survey-maps. Al-Bir\u00fani says that at Mans\u00farah the Indus divided into two branches, one of which went east (south-east) to the borders of Kach. This is not consistent with the accounts of the older geographers, but there is no doubt that the latter gave a very imperfect description of the river, as they make no mention of a great eastern branch, which, nevertheless, we know existed. Indeed, several ancient channels taking this direction are still traceable from middle and lower Sindh to the Ran of Kach, and a portion of one of these is shown in the map a few miles south of the old channel to which I have been referring, and which I think may have been an affluent of the eastern branch described by Al-Bir\u00fani.\nART. XIV.\u2014Antar and the Slave Daji. A Bedoueen Legend.\n\nBy Sr. Clair Baddeley, M.R.A.S.\n\nShas, eldest-born of Zuhayr King of Abs,\nHad eight-score slaves to tend his camel-herds.\nMany were valour-tried and loyal men:\nBut, for sheer iron sinew, past them all,\nDaji, their prince's favourite,\u2014even as a snake\nBy coil on coil is throned the jungle's lord,\u2014\nSo mastered them by force or venomed words,\n(By which he fawned on his oft-angered Liege\nFor fresh rewards), that none of those eight-score\nVentured his frown:\u2014a slave being tyrant worse,\nAbove his abject fellows once upraised,\nThan throne-born despot: wherefore, too, a man,\nOf those two rules, the royaller tyranny\nDoth easier brave!\n\nNow fell it on a day\nThat all the most forlorn of both the tribes\nComing together,\u2014orphans, aged, and poor,\nUrged a scant drove to water at the pool:\nAnd lingering, gossipped at the water-side\nThe while their camels drank.\n\nThen, like such shade\nAs ends the noontide singing in a grove,\nBidding each bird sit closer on its nest,\nThis Daji came to drive their beasts aloof\nLording the troubled puddles with a curse,\nEven for his Prince's cattle. But thereat\nA grialed hag, tottering, all-bent, drew nigh,\nThen suppliantly made timid-voiced request:\u2014\n\"Good master Daji, let my wretches drink!\nThese few mean things are my whole maintenance:\nPity their leanness: Aye, look you what necks!\nSome scarce will live the night!\"\n\nStraight fury-like,\nHe screamed lewd words, abused her,\u2014wished her dead;\nTill she like some old wing-clipt owl crept off,\nShedding some silent wrath in tears. Anon,\nYet feebler than herself, like blasted corn\nBlackened by storms or blight, a sickly crone\nLeaned up before him, saying:\u2014\"O master, see\nI am as Time's worst target; look at me:\nI have had husbands, children, pleasant days,\nTill all like summer's leaves were stripped from me;\nSo, saving those poor fleeces, life is bare.\nAh, let not tears like these be turned to frost,\nLet the sheep drink! O master, let them drink:\nFor on their milk I live.\"\n\nThen he, seeing men\nStaring agape, to mark what he would do,\nWhirling enraged upon her where she stood,\nStruck her, throwing her down upon her back,\nRevealing her: and all those fawners laughed;\nWhile he, well-pleased, outlaughed them: as some gust\nOf evil-working wind that dulls the sound\nOf merrier raindrops!\u2014Antar urging by,\nSwift as the levin, with one roar of rage\nRushed on the coward, under-gripped his thigh,\nHis iron right hand eating at his throat,\u2014\nThen lifting him as he had been a babe,\nDashed him down hard on the unyielding clay,\nMassing his length and bulk; straight called aloud,\u2014\n(Gazing once more at him,\u2014to seal the deed),\u2014\n\"Dregs of the land! base carrion! vermin, all,\nShameless as yonder wretch, whose worthless flesh\nMay jackals ravin,\u2014Allah warp your bones!\nHave Abs and Adnan friended with sick Fear\nAnd ta'en the infection fiercelier for their health,\"\nSince marking age beset by dastard hands\nNone bares a blade?\u2014none quivers at his heart,\nViewing this cowardice?\u201d But all they, there,\nSeeing the tyrant dead, yet fearing sore\nPrince Shas for very wrath would wipe them out,\nShouted upon him: \u201cAntar, none can save thee!\nSee: thou hast slain our Prince\u2019s favourite slave,\u2014\nHigher in grace with him than any here:\u2014\nThe very wind-vane of our master\u2019s moods,\nWhereby each one of us foreknew the day.\nExalted Daji stiffens in the dust.\nDeath to his murderer! Come; who, Antar, slays,\nWill surely earn reward!\u201d\n\nSo some with stones,\nOthers with staves, and other some with goads,\nAimed at him standing, lionwise, at bay,\nPressing toward him in great number, fierce,\nTill he,\u2014as when a ship first weds the sea,\nThe last with-holding stock being knocked away,\nRushes with joy amid the merry waves,\u2014\nSprang to their midst, cleaving this way and that,\nFleaming their clumsy shoulders:\u2014all the air\nAthunder with vile oaths of pain and groans,\nAs he forth-went! Yet, creeping up anew,\nNoting him single, like base craven wolves\nA rallied herd gave mouth, and urged at him,\nTill many a gashing hurt bedyed his front;\nWhile down his cheek a crimson freshet flowed\nLike a red vein dividing some smooth marl,\nDabbling his thirsty lips. Yet heeding not,\u2014\nNay, rather glorying at the sight of Death,\u2014\n(Even as a storm that lightens till its end)\u2014\n\nKnowing heroic cause, he strook around,\nMisted in drifting dust; till nearing them\nPrince Hatem, wondering at the moil, scarce seen,\nCried at his brother\u2019s slaves: bidding them, \u201cHold!\nNow, by the Shrine, what do ye?

XV.\u2014Observations upon the Languages of the Early Inhabitants of Mesopotamia. By Theo. G. Pinches, M.R.A.S.\n\nIn the following pages I propose to go a little into a subject of great interest, whether we look at it from an antiquarian, or from a scientific point of view\u2014namely, the question of the ancient non-Semitic languages of Mesopotamia and the people by whom they were spoken. To this subject I have given a great deal of attention, and have, by examination of the documents left to us by the Assyrians and Babylonians, their successors, found out many interesting and important facts, which will, I hope, not only prove to be of interest, but also of value to those who make comparative philology their study.\n\nWe have not, it is true, any direct evidence as to the primitive home of these ancient nations, but there are documents which allow us to infer a great deal, and with probable certainty. The most important of these documents is, perhaps, that referring to the cardinal points, which, while showing how these differ from the cardinal points of our own time, give us also an idea of the direction of the migration of this people.\n\nThe passages referring to this are as follows:\n\n\u0161\u0101ru \u0161\u016btu m\u0101t \u00c9lamti, \u0161\u0101ru \u016btanu m\u0101t Akkadi, \u0161\u0101ru \u0161ad\u016b m\u0101t Su-edin u m\u0101t Guti, \u0161\u0101ru Aharru m\u0101t Martu.\n\n\u012amni Sin m\u0101t Akkadi, \u0161um\u0113li Sin m\u0101t \u00c9lamti, \u0113li Sin m\u0101t Martu, \u0101rki Sin m\u0101t Su-edin u m\u0101t Guti.\n\n'The south is Elam, the north is Akkad, the east is Su-edin and Guti, the west is Martu.\n\n'The right of the moon is Akkad, the left of the moon is Elam, the front of the moon is Martu, the back of the moon is Su-edin and Guti.'\nFrom this it is clear that all the cardinal points were (at least in early times) exactly between what they are now, the north being shifted westwards, the south eastwards, etc. But besides this, the paragraph referring to the moon speaks of the right hand as the north, the left as the south, the front as the west, and the back as the east, the names of the countries given for these corresponding with the indications given for the cardinal points. The west, or, rather, the southwest, is called the front, and the migrations of the people must therefore have been from north-east to south-west. This corresponds therefore to what we find in Gen. xi. 2, where, speaking of the Tower of Babel, it is said that as they travelled from the east, they came to a plain, and there raised the Tower, afterwards so celebrated.\n\nNow, as I have shown elsewhere, the Cuneiform style of writing was in use in early times in Cappadocia, and the country around seems to have borne the name of Cush. This I supposed (whether rightly or wrongly time will, perhaps, show) to have been the home of the Akkadian race, who, breaking off from the main body, travelled towards the east, and became the Kassites or Cossaeans of the later writers. These people, after settling there for some time, afterwards sent out colonies which settled in Southern Babylonia, to get to which country they would have to travel in a south-easterly (with them in an easterly) direction. Here they remained, and their language underwent considerable changes, and ultimately developed into the two dialects designated by many Assyriologists by the names Sumerian and Akkadian. Many of the Kassite nouns end in \\(a\u0161\\), and it is an interesting fact that part of Babylonia bears a name having this termination\u2014namely Kardunia\u0161, where \\(-ia\u0161\\) is the Kassite word for \u2018country.\u2019 I cannot believe, in the face of these facts, that Prof. Fried. Delitzsch is right in regarding Kassite as a language totally unconnected with Sumerian and Akkadian; on the contrary, it seems to be the fact that they are closely allied, Sumerian being the direct descendant of Kassite or Cossaean.\n\nBesides these three tongues\u2014Sumerian, Akkadian, and\nKassite\u2014traces are found of other languages, distinguished by the names Su, Sug, Mar, and Nim\u2014Mar being probably Ph\u0153nician, and Nim Elamite. Su and Sug were probably spoken in the north-east. There was also another tongue called Lulubite. The following are the words for 'god,' 'goddess,' 'Rimmon,' and 'the Sun-god' in these tongues:\n\n| God                  | Goddess               |\n|----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Sum. Dimmir.         | Akk. seems to have been Dardu, Kanuku, Iltu, and I\u0161taru (same word as Istar). |\n| Akk. Dingir or Digir.|                       |\n|                     | Kadmu.                |\n|                     | \u0120ilibu.               |\n| Su Ene (connected with the Akk. Eni 'lord'). |\n| Nim or Elamite Nab. | Kirir and Usan.       |\n| Mar Malahu.         | A\u0161taru (clearly the same as I\u0161taru). |\n| Lulubite Kiuru.     |                       |\n| Kassite Ma\u0161gu or Ba\u0161gu |\n\nThe God Rimmon.\n\n| Sum. Mur.            | Bara, Utu, etc.       |\n| Akk. Mer.            |                       |\n| Su Te\u0161-sub.          |                       |\n| Nim or Elamite Kun-zibami. |\n| Mar Addu and Dadu.   |                       |\n| Kassite Buria\u0161.      | Sa\u011f, Suria\u0161.          |\n| Sug Adgi.            |                       |\n\nOf comparisons between the Kassite and the dialect of Akkadian (called Sumerian), between which Prof. Fried. Delitzsch strongly denies that there is any connection, may be quoted the words eme, meaning in both Sumerian and Kassite 'to go forth'; the Sum. mulu and the Kassite mali\n'man'; the Sum. Gula and the Kassite Gali or Gala 'the goddess Gula,' also the adjective 'great'; the Sum. mer and the Kassite gamer 'foot'; the Kassite meria\u0161 'earth,' evidently composed of mer 'foot' (as in Sum.) and ia\u0161 'ground' (compare the German Fussboden), with some others. Of course it is only natural that the words for the deity in each language should differ greatly, as each nationality would regard its own patron deity as the great God, and this would become the word for the supreme deity in the tongue.\n\nSo much, at present, for the other tongues. Enough has been said to show what a deeply interesting field of research would be open to us if we had more documents to aid us in our researches, and what deeply interesting philological and ethnographical questions would be solved. Perhaps, on the resumption of excavations in Assyria and Babylonia, more documents may be found, but until then we must, I suppose, be content with such facts as have been preserved to us hitherto.\n\nIt is not my intention to discuss here the question which has been raised during the last few years, as to the name by which the two chief languages ought to be called, and I have therefore thought best to head my observations as above, rather than seem to incline to any particular view. Of course one thing is pretty certain, and that is, that the northern part of Babylonia was called Akkad, and the southern part Sumer. Whether, however, Sumerian or Akkadian was the standard language, or whether we are to understand a time-distinction rather than a place-distinction, I am unable to say with certainty. It may have been one or the other, or it may (and this is, perhaps, the most likely) have been both. At some future time, and in the light of the new texts which, it is to be hoped, future excavations in the East, on the sites of the ancient cities of Babylonia and Assyria, will bring forth to us, I hope to be able to discuss this interesting question.\n\nThe early languages or dialects of the early Babylonians were at least two, the time at which they were respectively spoken, and the place where, being, as above remarked,\nunknown. With regard to the tongues themselves, this much may be said, that whilst we can, to a certain extent, understand and explain the texts in which they are used, and even make compositions in these tongues, yet no one would, I think, be bold enough to translate one of those texts without an Assyrian (or Babylonian) translation\u2014indeed the difficulty is so great, that many students are frightened by the magnitude of the task which they would have to set themselves if they studied them, whilst others (but these are in the minority indeed), not wishing to give themselves the trouble of explaining all the difficulties, boldly maintain that they are cryptographies\u2014puzzles which the ancient Babylonians, having nothing better to do, set themselves to while away the time, and wrote long explanatory lists with distorted and unrecognizable forms of Semitic Babylonian words with dialectic variants, sound-laws, and a grammar, quite different from those of their mother-tongue.\n\nThe principal difficulties of the language are the large number of meanings which every sign or group of signs could have, and the large number of verbal prefixes (or suffixes). To this also may be added the large number of homophones, which, whilst giving difficulties to the modern student only in a limited degree (he having the characters to guide him), must often have made the spoken language difficult to understand, unless guided by some special intonation in the speaker's voice, or some faint echo of the lost consonant, which would have made the word distinguishable; for these early Mesopotamian tongues were largely affected by phonetic decay, hence the large number of homophones.\n\nThe language, as presented to us in the syllabaries, bilingual-lists, etc., consists, for the greater part, of words of one syllable, expressed by a character formed of wedges in various positions, each character having as a rule more than one meaning. These various meanings do certainly, as a rule, coincide to a great extent, but they also often widely differ. The following extracts from the syllabaries and bilingual tablets will make this clear:\n\n1 See the \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Keilschriftforschung,\" Heft 1, Jan. 1884.\nA Variously-sounded Character, having Meanings more or less connected.\n\n| Character | Meaning |\n|-----------|---------|\n| k\u00fa | nad\u00fb 'to set.' |\n| t\u016b | \u0161ub\u0101tu 'clothing.' |\n| st | k\u0113mu 'cloth.' |\n| u\u0161 | t\u0113mu 'command.' |\n| \u016be | ana 'to;' ina 'in.' |\n| gun | na\u0161u\u0161a\u0161u 'to raise, of the eyes.' |\n| dur | d\u0161abu 'to sit, to dwell.' |\n| gi | rubu 'prince.'\n\nA Variously-sounded Character, having Unconnected Meanings.\n\n| Character | Meaning |\n|-----------|---------|\n| ku\u0161 | n\u0101\u1e2bu 'to rest.' |\n| sur | \u0113zu 'strong.'\n\nIn the first of the examples here given all the meanings agree more or less. From the chief meaning 'to set' or 'place,' comes the idea of 'clothing,' that is, that which is put on, and from this also comes the word for cloth. A 'command,' also, is a thing which may be imposed on a person, and the meanings 'to' and 'in' also come from the idea of setting or placing. The expression 'to raise, of the eyes,' would, perhaps, be better rendered by 'to direct, of the eyes,' and would correspond to the English expression 'to set eyes upon.' The meaning of 'prince' probably comes, in Akkadian, from the idea of a person set up over the people, the word gi being probably from gin 'to set,' 'to be or make firm.' The meaning of 'to sit' or 'dwell' (dur) may also be connected.\n\nNow in the majority of the cases here explained, the character , here given in its late Assyrian form, appears in early Babylonian texts as and , the former when used for the word 'to,' the latter in the signification of\n\n1 Or tur.\n'prince,' whilst yet a third form, expresses the meaning of 'to sit.' Are we to regard these as being all variant forms of the same character, or as different characters afterwards assimilated, in consequence of their likeness to each other? The former may, indeed, be the case, but I am inclined to regard the latter as the more likely, partly from the natural tendency of such forms to become confused, and partly from the fact, that , meaning 'to,' coincides in form with the character which, in later Assyrian, is written as , just as, in the latest Babylonian, has to do duty for the characters written , , and in the earlier style, and , , and in Assyrian. Thus are we to explain what may be called the \"unconnected polyphony\" of the greater part of the wedge-formed characters of the Assyrians and Babylonians.\n\nAs has been already remarked, Akkadian and Sumerian were greatly affected by phonetic decay, the result being that an enormous number of homophones were developed out of roots originally quite distinct. As, however, in those grammatical forms where a vowel-ending is required, the lost consonant is restored, it was probably so in all cases, even where that consonant is not written.\u00b9 As an example of that extensive polyphony, I give a list of words indicated, by the Assyrians and Babylonians, as having the same pronunciation:\n\n**List of Homophones of the Syllable G\u00e9, with the Original Form of the Word where Known.**\n\n- g\u00e9 \u1d48\u0101i: \u0113\u0161\u0113u 'new.'\n- g\u00e9 \u1d48\u0101i: kan\u016b 'reed' (full form g\u0113n, for gan).\n- g\u00e9 \u1d48\u0101i: kitu \u0161a kant 'root (?) of a reed' (full form get).\n- g\u00e9 \u1d48\u0101i: mihiltu 'battle.'\n\n\u00b9 An exception must be made, however, for the roots ending with the letter l, which seems to have been always either left out, or softened, as in French.\ng\u0113 mag\u0101ru 'to obey' (full form gen).\ng\u0113 m\u00fc\u0161u 'night' (full form gig).\ng\u0113 mur\u0161u 'sick' (full form gig).\ng\u0113 kima 'like' (full form geme or keme).\ng\u0113 in g\u00e9-nun, kinunu 'fire.'\ng\u0113 za-g\u0113, \u0113llu 'bright' (full form gin).\ng\u0113 \u0161iklu 'a shekel' (full form gin).\ng\u0113 i\u0161ten 'one' (full form gi\u0161).\n\nOf course, in most cases, the position of the word in the sentence gave the sense plainly enough, and also in the compound words there could be no mistake as to the meaning. The words, also, having g or n as end-sound of the full form, probably retained an echo of these consonants, g being pronounced as in the German ending -ig, and n as a nasal.\n\nNow we have seen, from the examples quoted above, that the method of writing used by the early inhabitants of Mesopotamia was by means of characters formed of wedges in various positions; that many of these characters got confused by carelessness of writing, thus, to a great extent, creating the polyphony which exists to so great a degree. We have seen, also, that at the time when the Babylonians wrote down the Akkadian or Sumerian pronunciation of the characters, the words had become worn down to such an extent, as to make a very large number of homophones, but that it is possible that these homophones were only alike in sound to a certain extent. As we now know, therefore, with what kind of language we have to deal, and by what means the words were expressed, with this introduction (which, though short, has, I trust, been enough to explain the nature of the case), we may go more deeply into the language itself.\n\nAs shown by the two lists of words given above, Akkadian\n\n1 See my paper upon the Akkadian numerals, Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, vol. iv. p. 111-116.\nis essentially monosyllabic, the words having been brought to this state by phonetic decay, exactly as in English. The concrete noun is the simple root. As soon, however, as a suffix, either to express the plural, or a case, is added, the root takes the vowel \\(a\\) (dingir 'god,' dingi-ra-ni 'his god'), and any lost consonant is, as a rule, restored (a, 'father,' a-da-a-ni, 'his father').\n\nEven the form with the lengthening \\(a\\), however, seems to be shortened from an original root-ending \\(ag\\), which is still attached to a few words. This fact, indeed, is almost certain. The word \\(d-sag\\) 'fever,' was borrowed by the Assyrians, and they, as was their wont, added the Assyrian case-endings, and in doing so, changed the end-sounded \\(g\\) into \\(k\\), making the word \\(asakku\\), and the Akkadian \\(a-sur-ra\\) even, becomes in Assyrian \\(a-sur-rak-ku\\), and in this latter word, not only is lost \\(g\\) restored as \\(k\\), but it is even, as in the case of \\(asakku\\), doubled. It is almost certain, from these examples, that the Assyrian words were borrowed at an exceedingly early period, before the Akkadian language had quite gained the form in which we now find it.\n\nAkkadian (for by this term it will be well, perhaps, to distinguish the standard tongue) and its dialect were languages poor in words, but being essentially monosyllabic, it made up for this defect by compounding largely, and very many of its expressions are most interesting, as the following examples will show.\n\n**Verbal Compounds.**\n\n\\(igi-sum\\) 'to see,' 'to regard,' literally 'to give eye,' from \\(igi\\) 'eye,' and \\(sum\\) 'to give.'\n\n\\(gu-d\u0113\\) 'to prophesy,' literally 'to pour forth words,' from \\(gu\\) 'word,' and \\(d\u0113\\) 'to pour forth.'\n\n\\(gi\u0161-tug\\) 'to hear,' literally 'to make ear,' from \\(gi\u0161\\) 'ear,' or 'attention,' and \\(tug\\) 'to have' or 'make.'\n\u0161u-gar-gi 'to revenge,' literally 'to bring back a benefit-making,' from \u0161u 'hand' or 'benefit,' gar 'to make,' and gi 'to return.'\n\ngab-ri 'to oppose,' literally 'to set the breast,' from gab 'breast,' and ri 'to set.'\n\nIn all verbal compounds, of which there was a large number, the two parts were separated by the various prefixes. Thus 'he opposed' is g\u0101b-imman-ri; 'he regarded' is igi-imman-sum, and so on for all the rest.\n\nNoun-Compounds.\n\nThese are formed in almost the same way as the verbal compounds:\n\nlu-gal 'king,' literally 'great man,' from lu 'man,' and gal 'great.'\n\nki-tur 'seat,' literally 'place of sitting,' from ki 'place,' and tur 'to sit.'\n\ngubba-igi 'attendant,' literally 'he who stands before,' from gub 'to stand,' and igi 'eye,' 'face.'\n\ngi\u0161-uru 'beam,' literally 'supporting (?) wood,' from gi\u0161 'wood,' and uru.\n\naralli 'Hades.' This example is not quite the same as those given above, as the word aralli is not, strictly speaking, the pronunciation of the group. is pronounced \u0113, and means 'house,' kur means 'land,' and bat means 'to die.' The meaning of the characters is therefore 'house of the land of the dead.' Aralli seems to be for uru-galli 'the great city,'\u2014a very significant name for Hades.\n\nExamples of other compounds met with may also be noticed, and these last, though rather rare, are not by any means among the least interesting, as they show the extreme\nflexibility of the two tongues which we are now considering. This class of compounds expresses the subject, predicate, and object, in a very curious way:\n\nBur - mi (D.S.) bi-na-nam\u00b9\n\nBur - babbar (D.S.) bi-na-nam\u00b2\n\nmeaning respectively 'his raven is black,' and 'his raven is white.' The literal meaning is 'raven black (bird) his it is,' and 'raven white (bird) his it is,' instead of bura-bi (D.S.) mi-na-nam (babbara-na-nam) 'raven his black it is (white it is).'\n\n**Numerals.**\n\nThe Numerals are formed from different roots as far as five, and after that the first series is repeated and added to the word for 5. They are as follows:\n\n1 a\u0161 (a\u0161a), g\u0113 (for ge\u0161), and de\u0161.\n2 min.\n3 e\u0161\u0161e.\n4 \u0161imu.\n5 id.\n6 a\u0161 (a\u0161\u0161a) 5 + 1 a-a\u0161a for id-a\u0161a.\n7 lmina 5 + 2 l-mina for id-mina.\n8 \u1e0dssa 5 + 3 l-e\u0161\u0161e for id-e\u0161\u0161e.\n9 \u1e0d\u0161imu 5 + 4 l-\u0161imu for id-\u0161imu.\n\nThe tens now begin a different series, and their derivation is not easy to determine:\n\n10 gu, ga, \u016b, \u0101.\n20 ban, nin, nis, susana (\u00a7).\n30 ba, u\u0161u, e\u0161 (for \u016b-e\u0161\u0161e and \u0101-e\u0161\u0161e respectively, for gu-e\u0161\u0161e or ga-e\u0161\u0161e 10 \u00d7 3).\n40 nimin (20 \u00d7 2), \u0161anabi.\n50 ninnu, kingusilla.\n60 \u0161u\u0161 (dialectic mu\u0161).\n\n\u00b9 Assy.: \u1e62rib-\u0161u palnumma 'his raven (is) black also.'\n\u00b2 Assy.; \u1e62rib-\u0161u pipumma 'his raven (is) white also.'\nThe Method of Expressing the Cases, etc., in Akkadian and its Dialect.\n\nAkkadian was a tongue of singular mobility. A phrase could be expressed in the shortest, tersest way, leaving out not only the verb 'to be,' the postfixes marking case, but even also the plural suffix, as in the phrase:\n\n\\[ \\text{du} - \\text{abzu} \\quad \\text{tmi-na} - \\text{ne} - \\text{ne} \\]\n\n'the sons of the abyss are seven,' where the sign of the plural is left out after \\( \\text{du} \\), the particle \\( \\text{tmi} \\) 'of' after \\( \\text{du} \\), and the verb 'to be' is understood; or it could be provided with whole rows of prefixes and suffixes, as in the following:\n\n\\[ \\text{lu} - \\text{gi\u0161gal} - \\text{lu} \\quad \\text{du} - \\text{dingir} - \\text{ra} - \\text{na} \\quad \\text{su} - \\text{ni} - \\text{ta} \\]\n\\[ \\text{gi} - \\text{ni} - \\text{ip} - \\text{ta} - \\text{\u00ea} \\quad \\text{bar} - \\text{ra} - \\text{ni} - \\text{ta} \\]\n\\[ \\text{gi} - \\text{ri} - \\text{ip} - \\text{\u00ea} - \\text{ne} \\]\n\n'may it depart from the body of the man, the son of his god; may it go forth from his body.'\n\nIn the above phrase almost all the needful pronouns, suffixes, lengthenings, etc., are inserted. The first word, which is rendered in the Assyrian translation by the word \\( \\text{am\u0113lu} \\) 'man,' means here more citizen, \\( \\text{lu-gi\u0161gal} \\) seeming to mean 'man of an enclosure,' 'townsman,' \\( \\text{lu} \\) is the lengthening. \\( \\text{Du} \\) 'son' here in the genitive of position, as in \\( \\text{du-abzu} \\) above 'son of the abyss.' \\( \\text{Dingira-na} \\) 'of his god.' In this group the \\( \\text{an} \\) 'heaven' or \\( \\text{dingir} \\) 'god,' is followed by the phonetic complement \\( \\text{ra} \\) carrying the vowel-lengthening \\( \\text{a} \\), indicating that the pronunciation of \\( \\text{an} \\) is here \\( \\text{dingir} \\). \\( \\text{-na} \\) is the possessive pronoun of the 3rd pers. sing. \\( \\text{Su-ni-ta} \\) 'from his body'\u2014lit. 'body his from,' \\( \\text{su} \\) being the word for 'body,' \\( \\text{-ni} \\) the 3rd pers. sing. poss. pronoun, another form\nof -na, and ta the postposition 'from.' ginipta-\u0113 'may it depart from it' is a verbal group, composed of gi, the pre-cative prefix, ni, the verbal prefix of the 3rd pers. sing.; ip 'it,' a pronoun in the accusative; ta 'from,' the post-position, and \u0113, the verb 'to go forth.' Bar\u0101nita 'from his body' the word for 'body' or 'side' with lengthening, bara, the possessive pronoun -ni, and the postposition ta 'from.' girip-t-ne 'may it go forth,' is a verbal group like the former, consisting of the preactive prefix gi-, the particle -ri-, the exact meaning of which I do not know, the accusative pronoun -ip- or -ib-, the verb \u0113 'to go forth,' and the ending -ne.\n\nThe two examples printed above I have given in order to show the two extremes to which the Akkadian language could go in the matter of poverty or richness of those grammatical forms which we of the west consider so needful for clear expression, and also as specimens of the language. Almost every mean between these two extremes of redundancy and barrenness is to be met with, especially in the verb. I shall now try to give an explanation of several of these forms, together with an analysis of the same, but first I must say, that as the subject is, as before remarked, one of extreme difficulty, and one of which an explanation, from a scientifically analytical standpoint, is now for the first time made, although I believe that I have found out the true explanation in many points, yet there must needs be a few, which future researches will show to be wrong, but for any shortcomings in this respect I beg for that indulgence which I would readily accord to another.\n\nThe Verbal Root, with and without the Lengthening.\n\nThe infinitive of the verb is the simple root, such as is found in the bilingual-lists, as \u1e2b bad-p\u0113t\u016b 'to open,' \u1e63ur\u016b-na\u1e63\u0101ru 'to protect,' \u1e63im-\u0161ah\u0101lu 'to cry out.'\n\nThe simple verb-root, however, could be used by itself, without the lengthening, in the singular, to express various forms of the finite verb.\nExamples:\n\n1. Translated in Assyrian by the Aorist:\n   \\[\\text{nigin=usihhira} \\quad \\text{\u2018he enclosed.\u2019}\\]\n   \\[\\text{\u0113'=irbt} \\quad \\text{\u2018it grows.\u2019}\\]\n\n2. Translated in Assyrian by the Present or Future:\n   \\[\\text{tum=it\u00e1bbal or \u016bbbal} \\quad \\text{\u2018he lays or shall lay.\u2019}\\]\n\n3. Translated in Assyrian by the Participle:\n   \\[\\text{ba=muna\u0161\u0161ir} \\quad \\text{\u2018spreading abroad, distributing.\u2019}\\]\n\n4. Translated in Assyrian by the Imperative:\n   \\[\\text{tag=luput} \\quad \\text{\u2018thrust!\u2019}\\]\n\nIn all these cases, however, it may be that we ought to add the vowel (nigina, \u0113a, tumu, bae, taga), in which case they are to be regarded as defectively written, and come into the next rule, which is, that the simple verb-root could be used by itself, with only the lengthening, or the suffix marking the plural, to express the various forms of the verb.\n\nExamples:\n\n1. Translated in Assyrian by the Aorist:\n   \\[\\text{bal-bal-e (balbale)=ikka} \\quad \\text{\u2018they have sacrificed.\u2019}\\]\n   \\[\\text{digga-a-me\u0161 (digame\u0161)=irbu} \\quad \\text{\u2018they grew.\u2019}\\]\n\n2. Translated in Assyrian by the Present or Future:\n   \\[\\text{mu-a (or mua or maa)=ibban} \\quad \\text{\u2018it is produced.\u2019}\\]\n   \\[\\text{gi-a-mes (giame\u0161 or gingiame\u0161)=\u012bsappar (for \u012bsapparu)} \\quad \\text{\u2018they send.\u2019}\\]\n\n3. Translated in Assyrian by the Participle or Permissive:\n   \\[\\text{lal-e (lale)=tar\u0161u} \\quad \\text{\u2018it is fixed.\u2019}\\]\n   \\[\\text{pad-da (pada)=zakru} \\quad \\text{\u2018it is recorded.\u2019}\\]\n   \\[\\text{dul-la-a-me\u0161 (dullame\u0161)=katmu \u0161unu} \\quad \\text{\u2018they are covered.\u2019}\\]\n\n1 Evidently for \\[\\text{\u0113'=irbt} \\quad \\text{(for eye, Dialectic ome).}\\]\n2 In Akk. literally \u2018it has sacrificed,\u2019 namely \u2018my hand.\u2019 The Akkadians here used the singular, the Assyrians the plural.\nnigin-na-me\u0161 (niginame\u0161) = saidu sunu\n\u2018they are caught, enclosed, hunted.\u2019\n\n4. Translated in Assyrian by the Imperative or Precative:\n\n\u0161u-lu\u011f-gi (\u0161ulu\u011fi) = mist \u2018wash!\u2019\n\n\u0161u-lu\u011f-\u011fa (\u0161ulu\u011fa) = lims\u00fb \u2018may they wash.\u2019\n\nWith the negative the simple root, with lengthening, seems to give the idea of will or needfulness:\n\nnu-bal-e=l\u0101 \u0113teki, l\u0101 nabalkuti, or l\u0101 mu\u0161pilu \u2018it shall not be crossed,\u2019 \u2018it shall not be trespassed upon,\u2019 \u2018it shall not be defiled.\u2019\n\nThe Verbal Prefixed- and Suffixed-Particles.\n\nAs a rule, however, Akkadian and its dialect add a large number of prefixes (sometimes, however, used as suffixes), to express the various persons and moods, often including, also, the relation of case.\n\nThe following is a list of the verbal prefixes, gathered wholly from the connected texts:\n\nPrefixes.\n\nab-(ap)-\u00b9\nan-\nal-\nim-\num-\ni-\nu-\nba-\nmu-\nna-\nni-, ne-\nnam-\nna-\nnu-\nla-\nra-\n\nga-\ngu-\ngi-\n\u0161u-\n\u0161a-\n\u0161i-\ngi\u0161-\n\nprecative\n\nnegative\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Also ab- or ap, i\u0161 or ip, u\u0161 or up.\n\u00b2 The lists give also la and li.\n\nAlso en-, is-, and um-.\nMany of the above pronouns, as well as the verbal and nominal suffixes, and the separable pronouns, seem to be formed from the verb *men* 'to be.'\n\nAkkadian possessed two of these verbs, the one (that mentioned above) used exclusively as an auxiliary, the other used almost exclusively as an independent verb. This latter was the verb *gal* (in the dialect *mal*).\n\nBoth these verbs had given to the language a noun\u2014from *men* 'to be' comes the word *umun* (with prefixed *u*) meaning 'lord,' shortened sometimes to *\u00fbn* (*umun=**u*un, *u'*un, *\u00fbn*). From the root *gal* comes the Akkadian rarely-used *gal* 'man,' which passed over into Assyrian under the form of *kal\u00fb* (also exceedingly rare). The dialectic form of this word *gal* is *mulu*, of rather frequent occurrence.\n\nIt is from these roots that most of the verbal prefixes and particles are formed. From *men* we get the imperative prefix *umu*-, and the many forms of the other pronouns (*un*-, *in*-, *an*-, *inni*-, *ni*-, etc.). From *gal* comes evidently the prefix *al* (by loss of the initial *g*), which, prefixed to the verbs, makes those forms translated by the Assyrian participle or passive tense; and from this *gal* comes also, perhaps, the *ga* (*ga*,\ngi, gu, or 4) expressing the precative (may he do . . . ), and that particle -ga- which, inserted between the two pronouns, subject and object, of a verb, seems to express a kind of passive.\n\nMany of these inserted particles, namely da, di, ta, ra, and si, seem to be merely forms of the nominal postfixes da \u2018with,\u2019 ta \u2018in,\u2019 \u2018from,\u2019 ra \u2018in,\u2019 \u2018to,\u2019 and su or se \u2018to,\u2019 and it is probable that many more of this kind exist.\n\nThese particles are of course compounded, and form the numerous and puzzling strings of prefixes of which an example has already been given.\n\nThe most commonly used is in- an- or un-, which is generally added to the word to express the third person singular. Examples are:\n\nin-PALPAL-e=ittanablakat \u2018he revolts.\u2019\n\nin-GIGI-ene=i\u0161abbi\u1e6du, \u2018they herd together.\u2019\n\nan-LAL-e \u2018he weighs.\u2019\n\nan-AGA-e=imandad \u2018he measures.\u2019\n\nan-\u0161a-\u0113\u0161=\u0113p\u0161a \u2018they made.\u2019\n\nin-PA(D)1 \u2018he has invoked.\u2019\n\nin-DIB-ba1 \u2018he took.\u2019\n\nin-s\u01011 \u2018he proclaimed.\u2019\n\nni- is probably another form of this same pronoun:\n\nni-GAL=ibasi\u0161 \u2018he is.\u2019\n\nni-AG-ga =imdu\u0161 \u2018he measured.\u2019\n\nni-AG-e =imaddad \u2018he measures.\u2019\n\nni-AG-ga-e=imaddadu \u2018they measure.\u2019\n\nni-LAL-e-me\u0161=i\u0161akkalu \u2018they weigh.\u2019\n\nni-GAL-la=\u0161aknu \u2018he made.\u2019\n\nni-PAL-e=ibbalakkitu \u2018he revolted.\u2019\n\n1 From the case-tablets\u2014originals written while the tongue was still living.\nTo *in-* expressing the object, might be added the particle *ga* (part, evidently, of the verb \u2018to be\u2019), seeming to give the verb to which it is added a passive meaning. *in* is, as before, changed into *an*:\n\n\\[ \\text{ingan-zu} = \\text{illamad} \\quad \\text{\u2018he learnt\u2019} \\quad (= \\text{\u2018he was made to know\u2019}). \\]\n\nStill more common is the compound *inda-* (*unda-* and *anda-*). The particle *da* seems to give the idea of association, and is perhaps the same as the suffix *-da* \u2018with.\u2019 The following are examples:\n\n\\[ \\text{unda-gi} = \\text{ut\u0101r} \\quad \\text{\u2018he returns.\u2019} \\]\n\\[ \\text{inda-gal} = \\text{ibass\u012bt} \\quad \\text{\u2018he is.\u2019} \\]\n\\[ \\text{gab-inda-ri-a} = \\text{imhuru} \\quad \\text{\u2018he opposed.\u2019} \\]\n\\[ \\text{unda-ri-a} = \\text{irm\u016b-\u0161u} \\quad \\text{\u2018he set him.\u2019} \\]\n\nThe group of prefixes *innan* is very common, and expresses, according to the lists, the subject of the verb with the accusative. This was formerly explained as the prefix *in* with the infix *nan*, but this explanation is wrong. The accusative is expressed by *inna* (a lengthened form of *in*) with *an* (for *in*), so that *innan-lal*, for instance, means \u2018it he weighed.\u2019 The following are examples:\n\n\\[ \\text{innan-lal} = \\text{i\u0161ku\u0161u} \\quad \\text{\u2018he weighed it.\u2019} \\]\n\\[ \\text{innan-lal-e\u0161} = \\text{i\u0161kulu\u0161u} \\quad \\text{\u2018they weighed it.\u2019} \\]\n\\[ \\text{innan-lal-e} = \\text{i\u0161akkalu\u0161u} \\quad \\text{\u2018he weighs it.\u2019} \\]\n\\[ \\text{innan-lal-ene} = \\text{i\u0161akkalu\u0161u} \\quad \\text{\u2018they weigh it.\u2019} \\]\n\\[ \\text{innan-lal-me\u0161} = \\text{i\u0161kulu\u0161u} \\quad \\text{\u2018they weighed it.\u2019} \\]\n\nThe case-tablets give us also forms in which the subject is not expressed:\n\n\\[ \\text{inna-lal} \\quad \\text{\u2018(he) weighed it.\u2019} \\]\n\\[ \\text{inna-lal-me\u0161} \\quad \\text{\u2018(they) weighed it.\u2019} \\]\n\n1 From the case-tablets\u2014originals written while the language was still living.\nThe prefix *in*, changed to *en*, enters largely into the formation of what is known as the Precative Mood.\n\nThe ordinary prefix expressing the Precative is *gi* or *ge*, or with vowel-harmony *ga* or *gu*. The stronger form *ga-* is also found, as well as the still more weakened *\u00e2*.\n\nThe prefix *gi* is expressed by the character meaning 'to be.' It is found with this meaning in the phrase *gan-gan-dam*, in Assyrian *gibta \u016bakkan* 'he made a profit' or 'revenue,' literally 'he caused a profit to be,' the reduplication here seeming to indicate the causative sense. The word *gan* is the fuller form of the verb 'to be.'\n\n*gi* is also used, with the lengthening *a*, to express the particles 'either . . . or,' in Assyrian *l\u016b*:\n\n*utug gul gi-a, a-l\u0101 gul gi-a, gidim gul gi-a, etc.*\n\n'an *utug* evil be it, an *al\u016b* evil be it, a *gidim* evil be it,' etc.\n\nin better English 'whether it be an evil *utug*, or an evil *ald*, or an evil *gidim,* etc. (in Assyrian: *l\u016b utukku limnu, l\u016b al\u016b limnu, l\u016b edimmu limnu,* etc.)\n\nAs a verbal prefix *gi* is generally followed by the syllable *en*, which is either the same as the prefix *an-, in-,* or *un-*, or else a kind of phonetic complement, restoring the lost ending of the verb *gan* 'to be.' The former explanation is, however, the more probable. The following examples will illustrate this form:\n\n*gi-en-gub-ba=l\u016bk\u0101n* 'may it be placed.'\n*gi-en-gi-gi=l\u016btir* 'may he turn.'\n*gi-en-gab-a=l\u016bppatir* 'may it be loosened.'\n\n1 This word in Assyrio-Babylonian seems to be weakened from a root meaning 'to be able,' and is prefixed to verbal forms, as *l\u016b* or *li.*\n2 Names of demons.\ngi-en-gub-bu-u\u0161=l\u00e1k\u00e1n\u00b9 'may they be placed.'\n\ngi-en-da-an-gal=l\u00fana\u0161t 'may he raise with.'\n\ngi-en-\u0161i-in-gi-gi=ll\u00faru 'may he turn.'\n\nga-ba-an-gub-ba=l\u00e1k\u00e1n 'may he fix it.'\n\nga-ba-an-z\u00ed-z\u00ed=l\u00edssuh (?) 'may he remove it.'\n\nnam-ga-ba-ra-tar-ru-da or nam-ga-ba-da-an-tar-ru-de=ll\u00faru-\u0161u 'may he curse him.'\n\nga-ba-ra-an-ga-ga=l\u00ed\u0161kun or l\u00fapakid 'may he make,' or 'may he appoint to him.'\n\ngu-mu-ra-ab-sum-mu=liddin-ka 'may he give to thee.'\n\nju-mu-ra-ab-bi=l\u00edkkbi-ka 'may he speak to thee.'\n\nThe prefixes in and inna are the most common forms of the third person. The most common form of the second person is e, to find which we must first go to the imperative.\n\nThe imperative proper is expressed by the syllable ab, placed usually at the end. The meaning of this particle is probably 'thou,' and seems to be another form of the syllable ib, explained in the wrongly-named \"five-column syllabary,\" by atta 'thou.' It may not be amiss to reproduce here the passages containing this explanation:\n\n\u00b9 The plural is not expressed\u2014perhaps more correctly\u2014in the Assyrian translation.\n\u00b2 The full phrase is \u0161u-na gendangal 'may he raise it with his hand.'\n\u00b3 The verbal form here implies motion towards a given point.\n\u2074 Literally, 'fate may him-to decide,' and 'fate may him-with he decide,' that is, 'may he decide the fate against him,' from nam-tar 'to decide fate.'\n\u2075 For ju-mu-e-ra-ab-sum-mu 'may (he) thee-to it give.'\nParagraph 6.\n\n| lu - ri - e\u0161 - ka | ra | ana- ku |\n|------------------|----|--------|\n| 'I (at the beginning).' |\n\n| li | ra - a-\u0161u |\n|----|-----------|\n| 'to be chief (P).'\n\n| ib | at - ta |\n|----|---------|\n| 'thou (at the end).'\n\nParagraph 8.\n\n| ib | ar | lu - ' - ud - ka | ib | at - ta |\n|----|----|-----------------|----|--------|\n| 'Thou (at the beginning).'\n\n| ar | na - a-du |\n|----|-----------|\n| 'to be glorious.'\n\nFrom these we learn that the Assyrian l\u0101r\u0113\u0161-ka 'let me make thee chief,' is, in Akkadian, or its dialect ra-li-ib 'I exalt thee,' and that the Akkadian (or dialectic) ib-ar, is, in Assyrian, li'ud-ka 'may I glorify thee,' and that the non-Semitic equivalent is composed of ib 'thou' (more properly 'thee') and ar 'to glorify'\u2014literally 'thee glorifying.' The characters and mean 'placed above' and 'placed below' respectively, and refer to the position of the pronouns ra and ib\u2014'above' being the beginning of the word, and 'below' the end. We see from this that the particle ib denotes the 2nd person, and ab is probably another form of this pronoun, used to express the imperative.\nExamples of the Imperative in -ab.\n\n\\[ \\text{si-sa-ab} = \\text{s\u016b\u0161ir} \\] 'cause to direct!'\n\n\\[ \\text{bar-ra-ab} = \\text{purus} \\] 'decide!'\n\n\\[ \\text{gar-mu-un-ra-ab} = \\text{\u0161ukun} \\] 'place thou (there)!'\n\nAb is sometimes prefixed, as in\n\n\\[ \\text{ab-tu\u0161-\u0161a-tu\u0161-\u0161a} = \\text{n\u016bh, n\u016bh} \\] 'rest, rest!' where the single prefix ab refers to the reduplicate verb, and is translated in Assyrian by the imperative twice repeated.\n\nIn some cases the b seems to have fallen away, leaving only the vowel a, as in the following examples:\n\n\\[ \\text{du-na} = \\text{\u0101lik} \\] 'go!' (for du-na-ab).\n\n\\[ \\text{lag-lag-ga} = \\text{\u016bbbib} \\] 'be pure!' (for lag-lag ga-ab).\n\nAnother, and rarer form of the imperative has ba-, evidently another form of -ab, prefixed, as in the word\n\n\\[ \\text{ba-nu} = \\text{nil} \\] 'lie thou down!'\n\nThe most usual form, translated by the imperative in the texts, prefixes the syllables u-me-ni-, u-mu-e-ni-, or u-mu-un-. The following are examples of these very interesting forms:\n\n\\[ \\text{u-me-ni-BUR} = \\text{pu\u0161ur-ma} \\] 'loose also!'\n\n\\[ \\text{u-me-ni-GAB} = \\text{putur-ma} \\] 'free also!'\n\n\\[ \\text{\u0161u-u-me-ni-TI} = \\text{l\u0101kt-ma} \\] 'take also!'\n\n\\[ \\text{u-me-ni-\u0160AR} = \\text{rukus-ma} \\] 'bind also!'\n\n\\[ \\text{u-mu-e-ni-si-in-OR} = \\text{t\u012br-ma} \\] 'turn also!'\n\n\\[ \\text{u-mu-e-ni-SIT} = \\text{repeat also!} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{u-mu-un-DUB} = \\text{tubuk-ma} \\] 'pour out also!'\n\nNow as, from a fragment of a bilingual text in triple lines, the pronunciation of\n\n\\[ \\text{mu-un-na-SUB}^1 \\]\n\n1 Or ru.\nis given as \\( \\text{mu-e-na-}[\\text{sub}] \\), it is most likely also the case in the example umundub quoted above, and we ought probably to read umuendub. This inserted e has the meaning of 'thou' or 'thee,' as the following examples will prove:\n\n\\( \\text{um-ta-e-z\u0131=} \\text{tassuha}^2 \\) 'thou removest it from him.'\n\n\\( \\text{\u0161u-ba-e-ri-t\u0131=} \\text{lik\u0131-ma}^3 \\) 'place it there.'\n\n\\( \\text{in-ga-e-zu=} \\text{t\u0131d\u0131}^4 \\) 'thou shalt know it.'\n\nFrom these examples it is clear that the prefixes umeni- and umun- are for umueni-. This long imperative seems to have been the polite one, and the examples given above are probably to be translated 'be thou he loosing,' 'be thou he freeing,' 'be thou he taking,' 'be thou he binding,' 'be thou he placing it to it' (litr-ma 'turn (it out) also'), 'be thou he repeating,' and 'be thou he pouring.'\n\nIn a large number of cases, therefore, where there seems to be no distinction between the persons in the verbal forms in Akkadian and its dialect, this arises from no defect in the language itself, but from the defective system of writing, which did not allow the people who used it to distinguish between the pure vowel and its modification or diphthong.\n\nAnother form of the second person of the verbal pronoun is \\( i \\), either a modification of \\( e \\), or of which \\( e \\) is a modification:\n\n\\( i-\\text{gub=} \\text{tazzizzu} \\) 'thou establishest.'\n\n\\( i-\\text{gub-bi=} \\text{tarrinnu} \\) 'thou settest.'\n\n\\( i-\\text{nam-ma=} \\text{atta-ma} \\) 'thou art.'\n\nIn like manner also the first person of the verbal pronoun is often expressed by \\( a \\):\n\n\\( a-\\text{ra-an-\u0161ub=} \\text{add\u0131-ka} \\) 'I place thee.'\n\n\\( a-\\text{ra-an-DUB=} \\text{a\u0161puk} \\) 'I pour out.'\n\n1 Or \\( \\text{ru} \\).\n\n2 W.A.I. iv. 27, 24\u201356.\n\n3 W.A.I. iv. 22, 10\u201311.\n\n4 W.A.I. iv. 22, 7.\n\n* The Babylonian scribes evidently regarded the prefixed \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\) or \\( \\text{\u0161u} \\) of this imperative form as the conjunction 'and.'\nLiterally, in Akkadian, 'I there it place' (as the line is broken, the pronoun 'thee' was probably otherwise expressed in the lost part), and 'I there it pour,' the particle -ra- being probably equal to the French 'y.' From the extract from the so-called five-column syllabary, given above (p. 321) ara- could be explained as a shorter form of ra=anaku 'I,' but the above explanation is preferable.\n\nIn these observations and notes upon the languages of the early inhabitants of Mesopotamia I have only been able to give the broad outlines of that part of the accidence which is not generally treated of. It was, at first, my intention to make these observations much more complete, but want of time and not over-good health have prevented this. Enough, however, has I trust been given, to enable the student of philology to see what these tongues really were like, and to prove that they were certainly not cryptographies, as some scholars maintain. Many of the explanations which I have given will probably have to be abandoned when we know more about these interesting tongues, but the study is not by any means an easy one, and I therefore beg the reader's indulgence. At some future time, after a thorough examination of all the material we have, I hope to return to the subject, and to give as full a grammar of these languages as is possible, with a critical analysis of all the grammatical forms.\nART. XVI.\u2014On the Origin of the Indian Alphabet. By R. N. Cusy, Esq., Honorary Secretary R.A.S.\n\nThis subject was first mooted by Sir William Jones in the Asiatic Researches. Some of the most distinguished Scholars have at different times expressed opinions, totally irreconcilable with each other. New direct or indirect fragments of evidence have been contributed, sometimes narrowing, sometimes widening, the arena of the controversy. Last year Mr. Isaac Taylor summarised the facts of the case in his Book on \"The Alphabet.\" I myself contributed a paper on the subject to the Indian Section of the Sixth Oriental Congress at Leyden, in September 1883, which led to a lively discussion, occupying the best part of two days of the Session. In January of this year I again brought the subject before this Society, and I now place the whole case before the Members of the Society in the pages of our Journal.\n\nLet us first deal with facts, and then pass on to theories. The Indian Alphabet is a marvellous and magnificent phenomenon quite unrivalled in the world. History is absolutely silent as to its origin, and development. Legendary accounts are also wanting. The earliest specimens of it have a well-ascertained date, and Inscriptions are found in excellent preservation in many parts of India, from the extreme Northern frontier of Peshawar to the Island of Ceylon. I have seen some of these and passed my hands over them, and, being actually in situ, not shut up within the modern walls of a foreign Museum, they make a deeper impression upon the mind even than the venerable stone of Thera at Athens, or the Assyrian and Egyptian Inscriptions, all of which can boast of a much greater\nantiquity. But this Alphabet represents a symmetrical combination of symbols, designed by skilled Grammarians to indicate various shades of sounds, and is grouped in scientific order. The hand of a Brahmanical Scholar, dealing with a highly-polished Language, is detected here. No such refinement was necessary for the Vernaculars. This Alphabet became the Mother of a magnificent family spread over the whole of India, Nearer, and Further, Ceylon, the Indian Archipelago, and the Central Asiatic Plateau as far as Mongolia. In these two particulars the Indian Alphabet has no parallel, but enquiry is for the present restricted to the question, How did the Indians in the Centuries preceding the Christian era get this Alphabet and at what approximate period?\n\nBut other facts require to be noticed. I quote Prof. Max M\u00fcller's History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 497. There is not one single allusion in the thousand Vedic Hymns to anything connected with writing. Such indeed is also the case, with the exception of one doubtful passage, with the Homeric Poems. To this silence the Hebrew Scriptures present a great contrast, as in the Book of Exodus the art of writing is unmistakeably alluded to, and the same three consonants used which represent to this day the idea to countless Millions in Asia. Throughout the whole Brahmana period, there is no mention of writing materials, whether paper, bark, or skins. In the Sutra period, although the art of writing began to be known, the whole literature of India was preserved by oral tradition only: more than this, Kum\u00e1rla's remark, that the knowledge of the Veda is worthless, if it has been learnt from writing, amounts to condemning its use after it is known to exist. However, the use of the word \"Patila,\" or \"Chapter,\" for the Sutra, a word never used in the Brahmana, lets in a side light: its meaning is a \"covering,\" \"the surrounding skin or membrane\": hence it is used for a tree, and is an analogue of \"liber\" and \"biblos,\" and means \"book,\" presupposing the existence of the art of writing. Again, in 1878, in Macmillan's Magazine, Max M\u00fcller states, that there is no\nreally written alphabetic literature much earlier than the Fifth Century before the Christian era: all poetry and legends must have been handed down orally previously. An Alphabet may have been used for Monumental purposes, but there is a great difference betwixt this and the use of it for art, pleasure and literature.\n\nProf. Roth of T\u00fcbingen at the Leyden Congress stated his firm conviction, the result of prolonged Vedic studies, that it was impossible to sustain the theory that the vast collections of Vedic Hymns could have depended for existence on oral transmission: he considered it a sine qua non, that writing was known, and that, in fact, a Pratis\u00e1kya, or Vedic Grammar, could not have been composed by any one who had not written texts before him. He gave, however, no hint as to the date of the first writing.\n\nAnother kind of evidence is derived from the writings of independent Authors. The historians of the Greeks, who came into contact with the people of India after the invasion of Alexander the Great 327 B.C., have left conflicting testimony: Strabo quotes Megasthenes, who states, that the laws were unwritten, that the Indians were ignorant of writing, and in all the business of life trusted to memory, not even requiring seals for their pledges or deposits. He also quotes Nearchus to prove that the Indians wrote letters on cotton that had been well beaten together, and that they had milestones with Inscriptions upon them indicating resting places and distances. Quintus Curtius mentions that they wrote on the soft rind of trees, a custom which is confirmed by an allusion in the play of Sakuntala. In the Lalita Vistara it is recorded that the young Sakya was taught to write. The value of this quotation of course depends on the date assigned to that work. The case seems to be that the art of writing was known for public and private convenience, but that the learned classes abstained from using it for literary purposes.\n\nWe have a significant fact also from a Hebrew writer: Xerxes, King of Persia (the same who was defeated at Salamis, B.C. 480), who was well acquainted with the\nGreek character used by his Ionian subjects, and the Persian Cuneiform alphabetic character, used by himself, and his Father Darius, ordered his scribes to write to the authorities of the different Provinces of his Empire from India to Ethiopia, unto every Province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their own language. This evidences a plurality of forms of script, of which practical notice was taken, and India is specially alluded to. The Hebrew character, which must have been the old Hebrew character, not the later square character, is also mentioned. The name of India at that period is inseparably connected with the River Indus. Was the character used by Xerxes for the letter to India one of the As\u00f3ka Alphabets? It is of importance to recollect that the Greeks at the time of Alexander the Great were a highly literary nation. Herodotus knew very well how different Egyptian Hieroglyphics were from the Greek Alphabet, in which he wrote his own notes: yet in the allusion made by Greek writers to forms of writing in India, we find no hint that it was different in kind from the Greek. Clearly, therefore, it was alphabetic, for a system of Ideographs, or a Syllabary with its wealth of forms, would have struck with surprise the Greek as much as it would a modern traveller.\n\nSuch are the facts: all that remains consists of theories, inductions, arguments based on analogies, ingenious combinations based on historical data, and Pal\u00e6ographical minutiae. It may be stated that the Archaeological Survey of India is drawing to a close, and the Archaeological Survey of Arabia and Mesopotamia has not yet commenced.\n\nBefore I commence an analysis of the discordant theories, I would place on paper certain general arguments, as to the possibility and probability of the Indian Alphabet having been derived from the West of Asia, and being the offshoot of one of the branches, or directly of the parent tree, of the great Phenician Alphabet.\n\nI. There has existed from time immemorial commercial intercourse, by land, across Persia and Afghanistan, and, by\nsea, by the Persian Gulf, and Red Sea, betwixt Western Asia, and India in its fullest extent.\n\nII. In Western Asia there has existed from a very remote date before the Christian era an Alphabet of a very complete and highly elaborated character, the oldest specimen of which is the Moabite Stone, to which a date of 800 B.C. is attributed.\n\nIII. That from this Phenician Alphabet at a remote period the Greek and Roman Alphabets were derived.\n\nThe derivation of the Indian Alphabet from the Phenician is therefore possible.\n\nLet us consider whether it is probable.\n\nI. The copious Indian literature, so garrulous, so faithfully reflecting the introspective and egotistic character of the Indian mind, so ready to supply a mythical origin to every fact or event, even to the descent of the River Ganges, or to the origin of the rocky ridges, which connect Ceylon with India, is absolutely silent as to the origin of the Alphabet, which is used in conserving that literature. Indian authors have certainly made use of alphabetic writing for more than two thousand years, and have treated upon every possible subject, physical and metaphysical, yet no account has been handed down by them of the origin of the marvellous vehicle of thought, which lay under their hands, and which they have elaborated to a degree unparalleled in any other country. Had it been invented in India, it would have been attributed to the God Gan\u00e9sa, just as the invention of the Cuneiform character was attributed to the God Nebo.\n\nII. An Alphabet cannot spring into existence in full development from the brains of any people, nor is it the result of a compact at any given period. Where such Alphabets have been constructed in modern times in England, or North America, in Africa, or China, the process has only been that of adapting new symbols to the old Phenician method. It may safely be laid down that an alphabetic system is the outcome of a long use of ideographic and syllabic symbols. A nation capable from its own self-consciousness of carving upon rocks alphabetic Inscriptions\nwould assuredly have left traces of the same tendency on the same endurable tablets in ideographic and syllabic symbols. Now in India from the Him\u00e1laya to Cape Comorin no trace of such a non-alphabetic Inscription, found so frequently, and in such diverse forms in Western Asia, and North Africa, has been found.\n\nIII. The resemblance of the Indian Alphabets to those that have taken root in Western Asia, Africa, and Europe, all of which are unquestionably of Phenician origin, is so striking that it is difficult even to entertain the idea of a separate origin. No speculator has been hardy enough to suggest that the Western lands are indebted to India for their Alphabet as well as for their Numerals. In the single instance of the Ethiopic Alphabet this idea was indeed once mooted, but is now definitely abandoned. The resemblance exists, and must be accounted for; for there is no necessity pre-existent in the human mind of one, and one only, method of representing sounds by symbols: at any rate, we have totally distinct and independent ideographic and syllabic systems in different parts of the world, which might, uninfluenced by contact with the Phenician method, have developed into totally independent alphabetic systems, but this phenomenon has not been proved.\n\nA consideration of the above points leads to the conviction, that the separate and independent origin of the Indian Alphabet is highly improbable, or in other words that a common origin is exceedingly probable. The importance of these *a priori* arguments of possibility and probability lies in this that it throws upon the opponent of the solution now suggested the necessity of explaining away the remarkable facts or reasonable inductions above stated.\n\nOf the Indian Alphabets there are two varieties, known generally as the North and South As\u00f3ka, though many others named have been supplied or suggested. Now these two Alphabets, though independent, and dissimilar, have many resemblances: though morphologically different, yet they are identical in structure: they adopt a contrary direction of writing: in usage they slightly overlap each\nother: coins are found bearing Inscriptions of both: the Edicts of As\u00f3ka were contemporaneously published in both in nearly the same language: the North As\u00f3ka died out in the first Century after the Christian era, and was absolutely sterile: the South As\u00f3ka, as stated above, is the happy Mother of scores, with all human probability of an eternal existence: in both the necessities of the language, to which they were handmaids, compelled the use of the cerebral letters, a characteristic shared by no other known Alphabet. The North As\u00f3ka is by unanimous consent affiliated to the Iranian branch of the Phenician Alphabet. Now this decision as regards the one Alphabet has an important bearing on the other, for a great many difficulties common to both, but surmounted in the one case, cannot be urged against the same solution for the other.\n\nThe theories with regard to the origin of the South As\u00f3ka divide themselves into two categories:\n\nI. Those which assert an indigenous origin.\n\nII. Those which assert a foreign importation.\n\nIt is worthy of remark that the authorities, who press either theory, totally disagree with each other: in this controversy each theorist stands on a separate pinnacle of his own private judgment, with but a small substratum of proof, manipulated by his own clever handling, and hanging together by his own ingenious plastering.\n\nLet us consider the first category: the champions of this view are Mr. Edward Thomas of H.M. Indian Civil Service, B\u00e1bu Rajendra Lala Mitra of Calcutta, the late Professor Goldst\u00fccker, the late Professor Christian Lassen of Bonn, General Cunningham, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, the late Professor John Dowson, and Pandit Shamaji Krishnavarma of Gujar\u00e1t.\n\nThomas is distinguished as a Numismatist and Palaeographer. He remarks in his Edition of Mr. James Prinsep's Essays, vol. ii. p. 48 (1858), that the South As\u00f3ka Alphabet bears every impress of indigenous organisation and local maturation under the special needs of the language, which it was designed to convey: at p. 144 of the same book he alludes\nto the independently perfected Alphabet of India. He quotes with apparent approbation a passage from M. St. Hilaire (Journ. des Savants 1857), that he could better understand the theory that the Semites received at third or fourth hand an Alphabet of Indian origin, and adapted it to their requirements by cutting it in half and mutilating it, than the theory of the Indians receiving a shapeless and confused Alphabet such as the Phenician, and elaborating it to the state of perfection in which we find it.\n\nIn the Numismatic Chronicle of 1863, n.s. No. III. Thomas treats of the Bactrian or North As\u00f3ka Alphabet, but he turns aside for an instant to express very decided opinions on the subject of the South As\u00f3ka. He remarks that this Alphabet possesses in an eminent degree the merit of simplicity combined with extended distinctive capabilities, and remarkable facility of lection: it is formed from a very limited number of literal elements, and its construction exhibits not only a definite purpose throughout, but indicates a high order of intellectual culture on the part of the designers, who discriminated by appropriate letters gradations of sounds often inappreciable to European ears, and seldom susceptible of correct utterance by European organs of speech. It clearly constituted an independently-devised and locally-matured scheme of writing, adapted with singular facility for the exhibition of the language of the country, and as such competent to express all needed in the ancient vernaculars equally as in its but little changed, though more curvilinear and elaborately combined, forms, it suffices for the present day for all the demands of the multifarious dialects. He then goes on to say that the North As\u00f3ka, unlike the South, has no pretence whatever to an indigenous origin: and was superseded and extinguished by its more flexible and congruous associate of indigenous growth. It is worthy of remark that Thomas was aware, when he penned the above, of the arguments of Max M\u00fcller and Professor Weber quoted in this paper, yet he is surprised that the Indian Alphabet could be deemed an emanation from a Phenician Stock, when we have in full contemporaneous development\na series of letters adapted to Indian wants, which not only declare their derivation in their own forms, but show how inconceivable a series of transmutations must have been gone through in the other instance to produce so innately dissimilar a set of characters from one and the same source.\n\nAt a meeting of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1866 (Journal of Royal Asiatic Society, n.s. Vol. V. p. 420), Thomas propounded the theory, I. that the Arians had never invented an Alphabet, but were always indebted to the nationality, among whom they settled, for their knowledge of writing; II. that the South As\u00f3ka was obviously originated to meet the requirements of the Dravidian languages. This expression of opinion was communicated to the Bengal Asiatic Society, and the subject was discussed there in 1866 and 1867, vide Journal of Bengal Asiatic Society, vol. xxxv. p. 138, and vol. xxxvi. p. 33. In 1871, Thomas, in his paper in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, n.s. Vol. V. p. 422, brought up the topic again, and affirms his theory in a long argumentative note based upon an examination of the different letters of the Alphabet. In 1874\u201375, he remarks in a Note to Mr. Burgees's Report on the Survey of Western India for 1874\u201375, p. 46, that his inference regarding the Turanian, or quasi-Dravidian, origin of the South As\u00f3ka does not imply a copying or imitation of any given Tamil (query Dravidian) Alphabet, and far less of the modern form now current: his object in giving the Romanized letters of that Alphabet was merely to show what letters were required, and what were not required to express one group of Dravidian languages. In a private letter to my address in 1879 he remarks that the more he advances in knowledge, the more confirmed is he in the universality of the primitive Scythian element, its predominance in Indian Alphabets, and its vitality in Indian speech. Again in 1884, understanding that my attention was turned to the subject, he assures me that he has not modified his opinion at all with regard to the origin of the Indian Alphabet.\n\nThe theory of Thomas was twice discussed at meetings of the Bengal Asiatic Society in Calcutta, and on the second\noccasion Rajendra Lala Mitra, a Sanskritist distinguished as the author of many works on Archaeology, read a note, which he had prepared in the interval betwixt the first and second discussions. He directly traverses Thomas' argument, that no Arian Nation had ever invented an Alphabet by the remark that the Arian race migrated from their cradle at different times, and under different intellectual circumstances. The Indians were the latest, and it is neither inconsistent nor illogical, to suppose that they were more advanced than their predecessors in culture, and might possibly have composed an alphabet. And even supposing, as is probable, that they came to India before they had discovered the art of writing, there was nothing to prevent a highly intellectual race from doing so in their adopted country. There is not in his opinion a scintilla of evidence to show that the Non-Arians had a written literature at the time, when the Arians entered the country, or for some time afterwards. There is neither Inscription, nor Tradition, to support this theory. The history of the Non-Arians, apart from the Arians, is a blank, and all that we know of them from the writings of the Arians is that they were the reverse of a literary race. He then reviews the arguments of other authorities, and asserts that the Alphabet called the South Asoka existed long before the time of that Sovereign. The different shapes under which the letters of the different Edicts appear, can only be accounted for according to him by a long usage, engendering local peculiarities. He then enters at length into technical arguments.\n\nGoldst\u00fccker in the Preface to his Manava-kalpa-sutra, p. 15 (1861), cannot imagine the possibility of a people so civilized as they appear to have been at the time of the Mantra, a period anterior to that of the Sutra and Brahmana, being unacquainted with the art of writing, though no mention of this art is made in the hymns to the Gods: according to Lassen (Alterthumskunde, i. p. 1007), Prof. Goldst\u00fccker went so far as to maintain that the Rishi themselves committed to paper their own hymns as they composed them at that remote period.\nChristian Lassen of Bonn in his Indische Alterthumskunde 2nd Edition, i. p. 1006 (1867), stood up for the indigenous origin of the South As\u00f3ka Alphabet, and, with reference to Weber's comparison of the Phenician and Indian characters, he asserts that, when the letters are brought into close comparison, they are not found to possess the same phonetic value in both systems, and that the number of those, which do agree in sound and shape, is so very small that no safe hypothesis could be built upon them.\n\nCunningham is distinguished as an Archaeologist, and a Pal\u00e6ographer. He has had unrivalled opportunities of local inquiry, and familiarity with the Indian subject. He has published several remarkable works. In his Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, p. 54 (1877), he states without reserve his conclusion that the South As\u00f3ka Alphabet is of purely Indian origin, just as much as the Egyptian Hieroglyphics were the purely local invention of the people of Egypt. He works out an ingenious scheme to account for the indigenous origin of the As\u00f3ka Alphabet from ideographs representing different members of the human frame. The Indians could not, according to his view, have borrowed the Egyptian ideographs, as there was no correspondence betwixt the symbols, nor could they have borrowed even the idea of the Egyptian system of alphabetic symbols without borrowing the Egyptian system of Numerals at the same time, which we know that they did not. He admits that the difficulty in his theory is the non-existence of any traces of Inscriptions in the early stages of ideographs, and he accounts for this partially by the incomplete Survey of India, which may still contain unrevealed Monuments with specimens of archaic writing. He alludes to one very uncertain item of evidence in the Harapa stone, which however as yet proves nothing. It is fortunate in my opinion that one Author has been hardy enough to adopt this extreme theory, as it shows that this point of view has not been overlooked.\n\nDowson was a Sanskritist and Pal\u00e6ographer: he contributed a paper to the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. XIII. p. 102 (1881), but he was too ill to read it: so\nI read it for him, and he died very soon after. He states, that though he agrees in the conclusions of Thomas and Cunningham, he is unable to accept their arguments. His own are derived from a close study of Sanskrit writings: he considers that the peculiarities of the S\u016btra are such that their production and transmission was almost impossible without the use of letters: that as the Vedic teachers instructed their pupils in the rules of Sandhi, or Euphonic changes, it was incredible that the study could have been conducted with reference to sounds only without names for the sounds, and symbols to represent them: he admits that there is no proof of this. He is strongly of opinion that P\u00e1nini knew about writing, and that his date is from 600 B.C. to 400 B.C.: this leads him to the conclusion that the art of writing was practised by the Hind\u00fas five or six Centuries before the Christian era. He remarks that the North As\u00f3ka, though confessedly Semitic, has developed features such as a compound consonant, and adjoined medial vowels, to suit the requirements of a Sanskritic language, and there must have been some older Indian Alphabet, to which it was assimilated: of this however there is no proof. He does not think it credible that the Hind\u00fas, who were such masters of language, and who invented Numerals, could not invent their own Alphabet. He states the theory that neither in the North nor South As\u00f3ka have we the real original Indian Alphabet, as both are applied to a language passing into the second stage of decadence: of this again he gives no proof, except that such an Alphabet in his opinion ought to have existed. He admits that the cerebral letters are the special feature of an Indian language, and doubts not that their existence is owing to the influence of the language of the Non-Arian tribes, who were found in the country by the Arian invaders, but he scouts the idea, implied by Thomas, that the Indian Alphabet was of Dravidian origin. He admits that the art of writing was known in the West of Asia long before there is evidence of its existence in India: but according to him the fame of the art of conveying ideas by material symbols must have\npenetrated to India through the channels of commerce, and the idea of an alphabet must have reached India from without, though the practical application of the idea came from the Indians, and at a considerable period after the Arians had settled in the country. Such is Dowson's theory: to me it seems that, if things happened in the way in which he surmises, allusion to the adoption, and adaptation of this wonderful art would surely have appeared in Hind\u00fa writings: it may be true that no Arian race ever did invent an alphabet, and the operation suggested by Dowson can scarcely be called an invention in the proper sense, but only an adaptation of an idea, of which there exist several analogues in Asia, Africa and America. If the symbols, however, were entirely new, whence came the remarkable resemblance to the Semitic Alphabets in certain particulars? At any rate the Indians have beyond doubt scientifically developed their Alphabet to an extent quite unparalleled elsewhere.\n\nIn September 1883, at the Sixth Oriental Congress at Leyden, Shamaji Krishnavarma of Gujar\u00e1t, a Sanskritist and graduate of the University of Oxford, and a Member of Balliol College, in the discussion which followed the reading of my paper in the Arian Section, read a note in reply, which is published in extenso in the Report of that Congress. He drew attention to certain expressions, words, and phrases, the use of which in the ancient literature of India proves that the art of writing must have existed from a very remote period. He maintains that certain works could not have been composed, if the art had not existed. Himself an Indian, and a Pandit, with a well-trained memory, he asks how could such an enormous literature as that of India have existed without the aid of writing. He admits that his ancestors had a preference for oral teaching, and that his contemporaries have it still, but he cited certain quotations to show that the art dates back to the most remote epoch.\n\nNone of the distinguished advocates of the independent origin of the Indian Alphabet appear to me to have considered sufficiently, if at all, this remarkable fact, that the formation of a pure alphabetic system, free from any traces\nof Syllabary, or Ideograph, is a unique and exceptional invention, of which we find no instance except the Phenician in the history of the Human Race. It is not a simple conception, nor a necessary outcome of Human intelligence: the Chinese have never reached it, nor are likely to reach it. There are some things which it is hard to believe could have been invented twice: at any rate, in the absence of direct evidence to the contrary, and with opportunities of contact open, it is easier to believe that one nation derived it from the other.\n\nLet us now consider the second category, that the Indian Alphabet was a bond fide foreign importation of symbols as well as idea. As might be expected, there is here a great variety of opinions.\n\nFirst came the theory of a Greek origin. James Prinsep in the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society, vol. vi. p. 219 (1837), hazards the opinion \"that the oldest Greek was nothing more than Sanskrit turned topsy-turvy:\" that illustrious Scholar could only write according to the light of his own period, and the wonder is, that he saw so many things clearly and rightly: his argument was \"that so constant and close a conformity of the alphabetical Symbols of two distant nations could not exist without affording a demonstration of a common origin.\" In the volume of the same Journal for 1838 he sets out the \"Greek resemblances\" in detail. It does seem strange that he should not have thought of the even in his time well-known derivation of the Greek from the Phenician Alphabet, which is disclosed by the very names of the letters, and made his comparisons of the earliest form of the Indian Alphabet with the earliest form of the Mother Alphabet of the West. Dr. Otfried M\u00fcller followed Prinsep, and in 1838 suggested that the Greeks took their Alphabet to India in the time of Alexander the Great.\n\nThe theory of a Phenician origin requires more serious consideration. Jones had suggested in the Asiatic Researches a Semitic origin; he was followed by Professor Kopp in his Bilder und Schriften der Vorzeit (1821). Professor Lepsius in his treatise on Alphabets (1835) states\nthat he had no doubt that all the Indian Alphabets could be derived from the Semitic. Dr. Stephenson, in a paper on the Grammatical Structure of Vernacular Languages in the Journal of the Bombay Asiatic Society, vol. iii. p. 75 (1849), anticipated in a remarkable way the fact, that all the Alphabets of the world come from the same source, and that all Indian Alphabets come from the Phenician, or from the Egyptian: if it was a guess, it was a lucky one. Dr. Geisler in his Studia Palaeographica (1859) not only derives the South Asoka Alphabet from the Semitic, but also the old Persian Cuneiform Alphabet of Darius. Weber in the Journal of the German Oriental Society, vol. xxxi. (1856), was the first not only to take up the subject of the origin of the Indian Alphabet, but to subject the question to a serious and minute discussion. He has a few weeks ago in a private letter called my attention to an opinion expressed by Prof. Benfey of Gottingen in an Encyclopaedia published at Leipzig, p. 254 (1840), that both the conjectures of a Greek origin of the Indian Alphabet, and an Indian origin of the Greek Alphabet, are unnatural, but that it is not impossible that the Phenicians, to whom the Greeks owe their Alphabet, and whom we find about 1000 B.C. in commercial intercourse with India, made this important present also to the Indians: for thus by the intermediation of a common mother the resemblance of the Greek and Indian Alphabets, which is very striking as regards certain letters, is sufficiently explained. For the very peculiar development and systematization of the Alphabet in India would require a space of time equal to that between 1000 B.C. and 250 B.C., the age of the oldest Inscription. Weber tells me that he had either never read this opinion, or entirely forgotten it, for he does not allude to it in his Essay in 1856, and only by chance came across it, the book being rare, when he was preparing to reply to my letter. I wrote to him because I felt that betwixt 1856, and the present time great advance had been made in Palaeographic study, and many discoveries made, notably the Moabite Stone, and numerous other groups of Semitic Inscriptions, and I wished to know whether he maintained\nthe same opinion. His opinion was then and is still that the Indians borrowed their Alphabet from the Phenicians at nearly the same time as the Greeks borrowed theirs from the same source, about the period betwixt the eighth and tenth century before Christ. A long time was required to develop the Indian Alphabet from the few Phenician Symbols, and so great has been the expansion that the Alphabet, as it exists, may be almost spoken of as an Indian invention. In his Essay Weber shows the manner in which the original Phenician Symbol was altered and changed to meet the necessities of the Indian language with its rich vocabularies, and he went into detail to meet the expressed wishes of his friends: he expresses the opinion that, though subsequent modifications might be suggested, the general result could with difficulty be combated.\n\nIn the Sequel of this Essay he discusses the resemblances between the Indian and Himyaritic characters, and explains them, as regards the consonants by the common Semitic origin of both Alphabets: as regards the vowels he assumes it as probable that the principle of the Himyaritic vowel-marks, not the marks themselves, was borrowed from the South Asoka Alphabet. In doing so he sweeps away the opinion of Kopp, who found Masoretic influences, and of Geesenius, who found Greek influences, and he supports the opinion expressed by Lepsius (in 1836): the latter laid great stress on the name \"Masnad\" given to the Alphabet. Weber thinks that the reason why the Ethiopic Alphabet adopts the special mode of vowel notation, is the great wealth of Vowels in their Language, which is its distinguishing feature among all Semitic Languages, and that this being the feature of the Indian Languages also led to the same results. With regard to the period of the introduction of writing into India, Weber in his History of Indian Literature (1852) cannot admit the idea of such an art existing in the Veda or Brahmana period, and he attributes the great variety of texts held by different schools to their oral handing down: he quotes a remark made by Dr. Burnell in his \"South Indian Palaeography,\" that\nin the North of India, the cradle of Indian literature, no indigenous materials for writing existed before the introduction of manufactured paper, and this fact I can confirm from a long and intimate knowledge of Northern India from the Indus to the Karamnasa River.\n\nProf. Henry Kern, of Leyden, who has made a close study of the As\u00f3ka Inscriptions, was good enough to send me his opinion by letter: he is quite positive that the Alphabet was not indigenous in India, and was derived from the Phenician, but the peculiar channel by which the art was conveyed to India is quite uncertain. He is of opinion that the origin of the South As\u00f3ka Alphabet does not date from any remote period, for in the days of King As\u00f3ka it was used in various parts of North India and the Dakhan with insignificant variations. If it had been in use in India for many Centuries, more pronounced differences would be expected; as indeed the later history of the Indian Alphabet evidences. Allowing three Centuries as the period during which the writing might remain unchanged from its first use, 600 B.C. might be assumed as the date of the arrival of some Semitic Alphabet into India. This line of argument seems to me to take no notice of the fact, that the As\u00f3ka Inscriptions, though in different parts of India, were issued by the Ruling Power and probably in the Court character of the Empire, or the Province, just as the N\u00e1gari is used at this day in Public offices all over North India, in supercession of the numerous local varieties of script, which are used by the people.\n\nKern proceeds to remark that he cannot agree with the theory of M. Hal\u00e9vy (which will be described further on), that the discrepancies betwixt the North and South As\u00f3ka Alphabets, and the striking resemblance betwixt certain of the South As\u00f3ka and the Greek letters, could be explained by supposing that some of the letters of the South As\u00f3ka Alphabet had been remodelled under Greek influences. And his reason for non-agreement was the fact that the supposed influences must have operated precisely in those parts of India, to which the Greeks never penetrated, and no trace of\nthis influence is visible in the North As\u00f3ka Alphabet, which was used in countries where the Greeks had long exercised influence. He considers that the peculiar manner of denoting the vowels was an Indian invention, because in no other language except the Old Persian is the short vowel \\( A \\) so predominant, that the framer of an Alphabet suited to the wants of the case would feel tempted to consider the short \\( A \\) as something to be understood. In fact, Kern thinks that the missing link betwixt the South As\u00f3ka and the Phenician has not yet been found, and that we cannot therefore state with confidence what the channel of communication was.\n\nProf. B\u00fchler of Vienna, who during a long residence in India had turned his attention most particularly to the Inscriptions of India, which he has illustrated in the pages of the Journal of the German Oriental Society (1884), has expressed his opinion in a Memorandum printed in Vol. XIV. New Series of this Journal, as part of the late Sir Clive Bayley's paper on the Genealogy of Modern Numerals. He is of opinion that the South As\u00f3ka Alphabet comes before us a fully developed system about 300 B.C., and that it was even then an old institution in India, and that it owed its development to the grammatical schools of the Brahmans. He bases his theory on the fact of the enormous extent of territory over which it is found; that it must have been known among the higher and lower classes, as As\u00f3ka hoped to improve the morals of his subjects by his official Inscriptions: that the execution of the Inscriptions is excellent: that the Andhra Alphabet of the Caves is a sister-alphabet of the South As\u00f3ka, not a daughter, pointing to the existence of a common mother at some still earlier date. To this I reply that King As\u00f3ka may have published his official Edicts in his own official characters in every part of his dominions without the necessity of that character being localized in these parts, or being understood by the people. Inscriptions are found in many parts of Asia, and in Egypt, in situations, where apparently the object of their being placed there was not that\nthey should be read or understood, but for the self-glorification of the Sovereign who erected it.\n\nB\u00fchler shows that it must have been the Brahmanical Grammarians, who developed this Alphabet, as no other class would have invented five or six different signs for nasal sounds, three sibilants, and a careful distinction betwixt short and long vowels. Now this argument does not exclude the possibility of a Phenician origin, subject to a Brahmanical development, to suit a fine polished school language. But the number of nasals and sibilants are required for the Sanskrit Grammarian, and nobody else, for the Prakrit Language, in which alone Inscriptions are found, has thrown off this extreme discrimination of sounds. But this leads us to the conclusion, according to B\u00fchler, that they must have been long in use before the time when we first find them: and, as we shall see below, this opinion is of the utmost importance in determining by what channel the Phenician Alphabet found its way to India. He remarks that the inference as to a very early cultivation of the art of writing in India, at a time much anterior to 300 B.C., is strengthened by the consideration of the North As\u00f3ka, which was clearly worked up by the same class of people, who fashioned the South As\u00f3ka: take for instance the system of vowel notation and of compound letters.\n\nThe late Dr. Paul Goldschmidt, Archaeological Commissioner of Ceylon, in a letter to the \"Academy,\" Jan. 9, 1877, accepting the fact that India derived its Alphabet from the Phenician, starts the idea, that this Alphabet might have found its way to the Peninsula through the Island of Ceylon: if, as he assumes, the Arab traders were the introducers, this course in his opinion would be the likely one. Mr. Rhys Davids, late of the Ceylon Civil Service, drew attention to this opinion at the Leyden Congress in the discussion which followed my paper, and puts the case still more distinctly: viz. that the Ceylon forms of the South As\u00f3ka Alphabet were so different in several cases from those used in the Indian Inscriptions, that an independent origin was inferred for the Ceylon Alphabet, if not the greater honour of being the\nchannel of transmission to India of that Alphabet. When Goldschmidt died, his work was completed by Dr. E. M\u00fcller, who in his Report on the Ancient Inscriptions of Ceylon, p. 24 (1883), remarks, that the art of writing seems not to have been known in Ceylon so early as in India, for not only are there no Inscriptions, which can be assigned to the date of King As\u00f3ka, but nothing older than the first Century before the Christian era. As we cannot argue beyond our evidence, Goldschmidt's theory cannot be seriously entertained.\n\nThe name of M. Emile Senart of Paris must ever be connected with the Inscriptions of King As\u00f3ka, in consequence of the elaborate revision, which he has made of the text and translation in the pages of the Journal of the French Asiatic Society (1880-1883). An expression in Isaac Taylor's \"Alphabet,\" page 304 (1883), implies that Senart still attributed the peculiarities of the South As\u00f3ka Alphabet to Greek influences. As I could trace nothing in his published works to elucidate this point, I wrote to Senart, and asked him, whether he still held that view, and whether he would favour me with an abstract of the argument on which he based that view: he courteously replied by return of post, that it was an entire mistake to attribute such views to him, and that he purposed to discuss the subject of the origin of the As\u00f3ka Alphabet in the Epilogue to his Essays on the Inscriptions themselves. He however informed me of his conviction that the As\u00f3ka Alphabet was undoubtedly of Semitic origin. If there were any indications of Greek influence, they were restricted to \u00e6sthetic influences, which contributed to the regular and monumental appearance which they presented. As to the particular channel by which this Semitic Alphabet found its way to India, Senart was unable to pronounce any opinion: but to him it seemed impossible that the Aramean germ could have found its way to the South As\u00f3ka by the same road which was traversed to the North As\u00f3ka. On the other hand, he could accept the theory of an origin from South Arabia.\n\nThe late Dr. Burnell, of H.M. Indian Civil Service, in 1874 published his Elements of South Indian Pal\u00e6ography,\nwhich marks an Epoch in the Science. His conclusions are important.\n\nI. That the art of writing was little, if at all, known in India before the third Century before the Christian era, and that there is not the least trace of the development in India of an original and independent system; it followed, therefore, that the art was introduced by foreigners, or at least borrowed from foreign countries.\n\nII. That the original source was the Semitic alphabet, but that the immediate source was uncertain, there being three possible channels, the Phenician, the Himyaritic, and the Aramean: he discusses each separately.\n\nAs regards the first possibility, he lays it down as his opinion that all Phenician communications must have ceased five hundred years before the date fixed by him as the earliest date of writing in India. If, then, the art had arrived at that remote period, it would have been perfected and been in common use, which was not the case. It was difficult, according to him, to understand how the form of the letters could be retained with so little modification for such a long period, for the changes of the characters of a date subsequent to the Inscriptions of King As\u00f3ka were very rapid and marked. He further notices that all the South As\u00f3ka Inscriptions are in the same character, from which fact he deduces that the art of writing possibly spread over North India from G\u00fajar\u00e1t, the place where, in his opinion, it was first used. In the course of a very few centuries subsequently the characters used in G\u00fajar\u00e1t and Orissa, in both of which Provinces exist As\u00f3ka Inscriptions which are practically identical, became totally different, as is notoriously the case at the present day.\n\nAs regards the second possibility, that the South As\u00f3ka Alphabet was the offspring of the Himyaritic Alphabet in South Arabia, the great difficulty in Burnell's mind was to show that the South Arabians were in a position to furnish India with the elements of an Alphabet as early as the fourth Century before Christ. He admits that this Alphabet is written boustroph\u00e9don, which gets over the difficulty of\nthe different direction of the South As\u00f3ka Alphabet from its presumed Semitic original. He remarks that the Himyaritic Alphabet did not mark the vowels, but he admits that the Ethiopic Alphabet, its admitted derivative, did mark them. He leaves the case open, subject to further discoveries of lapidary Inscriptions in a country which is still virgin soil.\n\nAs regards the third possibility, that the South As\u00f3ka Alphabet is derived from an Aramaic type used in Persia, Burnell is more sanguine. He brushes away the idea that it can be traced back to the Assyrian Cuneiform Syllabary, or the old Persian Cuneiform Alphabet, but he calls attention to the cursive Aramean character, which had long been in use in Mesopotamia, and which, at a much later period, in the form of Pahlavi, became the official character of Persia. He quotes Professor Sayce to show that tablets exist, written in Cuneiform characters with Aramean docketts, as old as the reign of Tiglath-Pileser (745 B.C.). His difficulty, both in the first Edition of his Book (1874) and the second (1878), was that the South As\u00f3ka Alphabet (as well as the North As\u00f3ka and the Vatteluttu) had a peculiar method of indicating vowels in the body of the word, and that this method, though closely resembling the method of vowel-points in Semitic Alphabets, could not be evidenced as existing at a date earlier than the date at which it clearly was in use in India. In 1882, while suffering under that malady which proved fatal, he addressed a letter to the \"Academy\" to announce the discovery by Professor Sayce in the British Museum of a Cuneiform contract tablet, which precisely satisfied his requirements: it had a docket by one of the parties in a hitherto unknown character, which appeared to Burnell, after examination, to resemble closely the South As\u00f3ka Alphabet, with vowels marked as in the Indian Alphabet. This document could be attributed to the date of Artaxerxes II., who fought against Xenophon at the battle of Cunaxa (401 B.C.), a date earlier than that of any Indian Inscription, and the Language is not Indian. Every line written by Burnell is precious: he died at the age of forty-\ntwo: had he lived longer, the world would have known more.\n\nLet us now consider the opinions of other writers on the subject of the three possibilities of Burnell.\n\nI. The Phenician origin. We have seen above that several writers have approved of this theory. Isaac Taylor in \"The Alphabet,\" page 312, vol. ii. (1883), supports Burnell's objections: he states that the trade of India with Phenicia ceased 800 B.C., that only one character is found to exist in 250 B.C. so many Centuries later, that the art of writing was not practised in India till 600 B.C., and that there is no appreciable resemblance between the As\u00f3ka and early Phenician type, say the Moabite Stone. Now in my opinion none of these arguments are conclusive. It is not clear from History that the intercourse of India with Phenicia did cease so early, nor does the official character used by King As\u00f3ka for his edicts in the different Provinces of his vast dominions exclude the possibility of the existence of many other varieties of script in use by the people. The English Government issues its official orders in the N\u00e1gari character in Upper India, but it is notorious that very many varieties of script of the Indian type exist in the different Provinces in use by Bankers, and Accountants. Many Sanskrit scholars of note insist from internal evidence upon a much earlier introduction into India of the art of writing, as the sine qua non of the existence of its literature. Lastly we cannot rest much on resemblance, when we know historically, and beyond all reasonable doubt, that the Arabic Shikastah, the Mongolian, the Greek, and the Roman Alphabet all descended from the Phenician.\n\nBayley, of H.M.'s Indian Civil Service, had long interested himself in this question: so far back as 1867 he took part in the discussion which arose in the Bengal Asiatic Society upon Thomas' theory above described. When I brought the subject before the Royal Asiatic Society in Jan. 1884, he made some remarks, with the following abstract of which he has favoured me. After combating the assertion that the Phenician intercourse with India ceased before the destruc-\ntion of Tyre by Alexander the Great, he remarks that Indian writing had certainly an antiquity greater than this latter date, that in his opinion the Nana Gh\u00e1t (in West India) Inscriptions were of considerably greater antiquity than the As\u00f3ka Edicts, and not impossibly may be referred to the middle of the Fourth Century B.C. But even these represent the Alphabet already equipped with the full array of aspirated and cerebral letters, and distinctive marks for long vowels. Probably even this alteration was derived from the North As\u00f3ka, as the signs, which form the aspirated letters, seem to be imitated from that alphabet, and have in the South As\u00f3ka no inherent meaning, while in the North As\u00f3ka they represent the letter H. The simple Alphabet therefore on which the South As\u00f3ka was based must have been known to the Indians very long before the Fourth Century B.C.\n\nThe Phenicians were in contact with India at least as early as the time of Solomon, and they certainly possessed an Alphabet at that time, with which the Indians may have been acquainted. Some of the Indian letters seem clearly to be derived from the Archaic form of the Phoenician Alphabet: others from later types: many probably from the branch from which the Sassanian Alphabet eventually descended. As the Indians borrowed from an extraneous source, they would naturally, until their own Alphabet took its final shape, appropriate any more concurrent, or cursive form, which later improvement of the original presented. The change of direction of the South As\u00f3ka Alphabet may be attributed to the occasional use of the Boustrophedon method by early Phenicians, and to the nature of the material on which the Indians originally wrote. The latter was a substitute for the fine clay, on which the tablets of the Western Asiatics were written, and not being available in India was replaced by the use of tablets of wood smeared with a mixture of clay and cow-dung, as is still used largely in the Village Schools of North and West India. This would account for the name given in the oldest Indian Inscriptions to writing: viz.\n\"lipi,\" which (as Burnell pointed out, though he rejected the inference) seems to come from the root \"lip\" \"to smear.\" It may be observed that at the present day the use of the root is almost exclusively confined to \"smearing with clay cowdung.\" On such a material it would be far easier to write that portion of the boustroph\u00e9don method which proceeded from left to right, as in the opposite method the hand would obliterate what was written on the surface of the moist material. The former therefore in the end would be eventually adopted to the exclusion of the other, and with it the reversed mode of writing the Phenician characters, which would be further modified by the necessity of epigraphic purposes. I deeply regret that, while these pages were passing through the Press, this accomplished Scholar and amiable man has been lost to his friends.\n\nAs regards the second possibility, it was M. Lenormant who first seriously put forward the theory that the South As\u00f3ka was derived from the Himyaritic. It is sad to think that the bright light of his genius has been extinguished in a premature death. In his Essay on the Phenician Alphabet (1872), which is an unfinished work, he makes the bold assertion or happy guess at page 150, vol. i. that the South As\u00f3ka sprung from the Himyaritic, and in his Sixth Table in the appendix to the first volume he gives the Indo-Homerite Branch, under which the Ethiopic, and the whole Family of Indian Scripts are ranged, but he either never worked out, or at any rate never published the details of his proofs. In my own Essay on the Phenician Alphabet published in 1876 in the Calcutta Review, and reprinted in my collected volume of Linguistic and Oriental Essays (1880), I followed Lenormant, and at page 355 of the latter work I give the Indo-Arabian stem, and remark on the new feature which this stem of scripts discloses in the fact that the notation of vowels is formed by conventional appendages to the symbol used for the consonant, and to such an extent that in consequence of this appendage in many cases the appearance of the consonant is modified. As it was not part of my plan in a brief Essay on the whole\nPhenician Alphabet to go into the proofs of a single stem, and as to me the theory was entirely new, at page 364 I remarked that the question of this affiliation was still an open one, and that the nomenclature of this stem, assuming this fact, is premature, and can only be accepted with reserve. Isaac Taylor in \"The Alphabet,\" 1883, p. 314, lays claim to the credit of having worked out the proofs not supplied by Lenormant, and he is satisfied that his theory is correct, and that Burnell is mistaken. His argument is as follows:\n\nThe transmission of the Semitic alphabet could only have been effected through some nation which was in commercial or political contact with India prior to the expedition of Alexander. Then, as now, India had intercourse with the Western world through two channels, by land and by sea. Her Northern Alphabet plainly came to her through the Khaibar Pass; her Southern Alphabet, that of the Inscriptions on the western coast, as manifestly must have come by sea. Now, from the tenth to the third century B.C. Yemen was the great central mart in which Indian products were exchanged for the merchandize of the West. For a prolonged period this lucrative traffic was in the hands of the Sabeans, and was the main source of their proverbial opulence. The trade between Egypt and Yemen began as early as 2300 B.C., that between Yemen and India was established not later than 1000 B.C. Even in the time of the Ptolemies the Indian trade was not direct, but passed through the hands of the Sabeans, who possessed extensive commerce and large vessels. Their ports were frequented by trading vessels from all parts; from the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, the coast of Africa, and especially from the mouth of the Indus. From the Periplus we learn that Aden was a great entrep\u00f4t of this commerce, while at the beginning of the second century B.C. the island of Socotra was the centre of exchange for Indian products. There was therefore ample opportunity for the transmission to India of the Sabean Alphabet, which must have branched off from the Phenician stem at some time not later than the sixth century B.C.\nIt is to this very period that the origin of the Indian Alphabet must be assigned. A very superficial examination will suffice to show that the As\u00f3ka Alphabet, though it offers hardly any appreciable resemblance to any of the Northern Semitic Alphabets, agreed in a very remarkable way with the general type of the Alphabets of the Southern Semitic family. The common characteristics of the Indian and Southern Semitic Alphabets are their monumental style, the direction of the writing, the vocalization, and the retention of the primitive looped and zigzag forms. The general aspect of the Sabean Inscriptions agrees so remarkably with those of the As\u00f3ka that the resemblance cannot fail to strike the most careless observer. In both Alphabets the letters are symmetrically constructed out of combinations of straight lines and arcs of circles. Hence the writing is rigid, regular, and monumental, all slanting and cursive forms being absolutely excluded. The Sabean Inscriptions are written from left to right as well as from right to left. No importance, however, can be attached to the remarkable agreement between the Ethiopic and Indian systems of vocalic notation, since the Ethiopic Alphabet is later in date than the other.\n\nStrengthened by the above arguments, I brought forward this solution of the problem distinctly at the Leyden Congress in 1883 in my paper on the Origin of the Indian Alphabet, and although a long discussion followed, in which many distinguished men took part, I cannot flatter myself that a single one supported my views. I stated the case as follows:\n\nThe South As\u00f3ka Alphabet was imported from Arabia, and was derived by the Red Sea, from the Himyaritic development of the Phenician Alphabet. Unquestionably the continuous existence of a commerce between Yemen and South India can be asserted from a very remote period, quite sufficient to meet all requirements. This channel of conveying the knowledge of the Alphabet was possible. It is shown further that the Himyaritic Alphabet branched off from the Phenician not later than the sixth century before Christ, and it is to about this date that the origin of the\nIndian Alphabet is assigned, as the result of a careful chain of reasoning. It is suggestive that there exists in the extreme south of the peninsula of India a third Alphabet, confessedly independent of the South As\u00f3ka, the Vatteluttu, which, though nearly entirely superseded by later Alphabets, has left marked traces of its peculiarities in the Tamil character. Now this Alphabet, though differing from the South As\u00f3ka, and only adapted to the sound of a Dravidian language, shares with the As\u00f3ka certain Semitic resemblances, and must have been a foreign importation; and in this case there can be no question that it must have been imported by sea from countries which already possessed Alphabets, for there exists no possible presumption of its invention at home or importation by land from abroad.\n\nPassing from general considerations to a particular comparison of the original letters of the South As\u00f3ka with the Himyaritic, I stated that the style of both is strikingly monumental; the direction of the writing of the South As\u00f3ka is from left to right, and we find that Himyaritic is written in the boustrophedon manner either way, and as a fact its admitted descendant, the Ethiopic, adopted the same direction as the As\u00f3ka. It is noteworthy that to the same Alphabet of Arabia the honour is thus ascribed of giving a vehicle of speech to India and Ethiopia. The mode of noting the vowels in the Ethiopic and the As\u00f3ka have a special resemblance, and although the Ethiopic came into existence at a much later date, yet its possession of these peculiarities, and its undoubted parentage, add to the probability of the South As\u00f3ka, which possesses the same features, having come, though at an earlier date, from the same stock. The objections are that in India culture, religion, and the arts of civilization have always proceeded from the North to the South. As a general rule this may be the case, but the casual introduction of a special art from a foreign country must be an exception. In modern times the art of printing has spread from the South to the North, being an import from the West, just as it is urged that more than 2000 years earlier the art of writing found its way.\nI admitted however that a more serious objection was that up to this time no Himyaritic Inscription of a date sufficiently early had been found. Late in time, compared to the Inscriptions of Western Asia and North Africa, as the South As\u00f3ka Inscriptions confessedly were, the oldest of the Himyaritic was considerably later. If such an Archaeological Survey of South Arabia, as has now taken place in India, were possible, earlier Inscriptions might be found, as the Himyaritic Alphabet is elaborate and refined, and the culture of Yemen is of remote antiquity. As it is, the intercomparison of existing specimens is that of sister Alphabets, alleged to be derived from a common, though as yet unknown prototype.\n\nAfter all, I only propounded a hypothesis, for there neither exists, nor is likely ever to exist, any direct or material proof. History is silent; tradition is non-existent; no hints or inductions can be drawn from ancient literature.\n\nAgainst Burnell's third possibility, Isaac Taylor in \"The Alphabet,\" vol. ii. p. 313, urges that there is no appreciable resemblance betwixt the Aramean and the South As\u00f3ka types, that in the former the loops of the letters had been opened, and in the latter closed: that this very Aramean type was already represented in India by the North As\u00f3ka, and that it was impossible to admit, that two such very different types should have found their way to India from the same source, one coming overland through Afghanistan, and the other by sea through the Persian Gulf. He lays stress upon the fact that Burnell bases his argument upon a hypothetical Alphabet, the existence of which cannot be materially proved. Now to this argument of Taylor's and one remark of Senart's at page 344, in my opinion it may be urged that the North-West frontier of India extends one thousand miles from the Indian Ocean at Kur\u00e1chi to the Him\u00e1laya at Pesh\u00e1war, and that the approach to India, whether by Armies or by Merchants, has been effected by a multiplicity of mountain passes all down the frontier line, and that there is little intercourse betwixt the tribes to the South of the Bolan Pass opening into Sindh, and the tribes North of that pass, who enter India by their own\npasses into the country of the Five Rivers. The scripts used in Persia may have found their way to India at different times, and by different passes: unquestionably the North As\u00f3ka is found in existence at the mouth of the Khaibar pass. The South As\u00f3ka may have come by the Bolan, and have never come into contact with the North. Again, the absence of an Inscription of a date sufficiently early to be the prototype of the South As\u00f3ka Alphabet presses with equal force against the theory of the South Arabian, as the Aramean origin, and it may with equal hardiness and light-heartedness be asserted, that there is no reason why an Archaic Inscription of a sufficient antiquity should not be discovered in unexplored regions at some centre of primitive Commerce on the Shores of the Persian Gulf. The argument of the absence of resemblance has been already noticed.\n\nM. Hal\u00e9vy ranks as one of the most distinguished Pal\u00e6ographers of the time, and he has not confined, like so many, his labours to the cabinet, but at the risk of his life he has collected or copied Inscriptions in the field: he is also famous in Europe as an independent polemic, one who hits all round with wonderful impartiality, and retires to a perfectly isolated pinnacle of his own private judgment. He was present at the Leyden Congress last September, and when I had read my paper on the Origin of the Indian Alphabet, he attacked my conclusions, and his argument is published in extenso in the Report of the Congress, though it is in fact but a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of a longer contribution to the Journal of the French Academy of Inscriptions not yet published. In his view no previous writer has yet satisfactorily explained the two-fold form of the vowels in the Indian Alphabet, when used as an initial or medial, and that all have erroneously accepted the theory that the North and South As\u00f3ka Alphabets were totally distinct, with the exception of the resemblance of the forms of medial vowels, which the North As\u00f3ka is supposed to have borrowed from the South.\n\nHal\u00e9vy considers the North As\u00f3ka as older in date than the South, and that therefore it is necessary to com-\nprehend the features of the elder sister before the position of the younger can be understood. No one has ever doubted that the North As\u00f3ka is of Semitic origin. Hal\u00e9vy affiliates it to the Aramean Script, of which the Ptolemaic papyri in the Louvre are specimens. Sixteen consonants were at once adopted with slight, if any, modifications; from these sixteen primaries, the secondary consonants were formed, which were necessary for the requirements of a Prakrit Language. He traces the vowels to the same source, and the absence of any symbol for short A, which is supposed to exist where no other vowel is expressed. He considers that the South As\u00f3ka was formed in an analogous way, but of more eclectic elements. After a careful analysis of its component parts, he finds that a certain portion of the forms are Aramean, and a certain portion Phoenician: when however he studies the phenomena of the existence of an Alphabet with a few Archaic forms and a great number of greatly modified Aramean forms, he is driven to the conclusion that as the archaic form of the South As\u00f3ka must have been derived from an Alphabet, which had preserved its archaic form up to the Ptolemaic period, and as the Mother Alphabet must have been at the very gate of India, it could clearly have been no other than the Greek Alphabet which was diffused in India at the time of the conquests of Alexander the Great.\n\nTo the seventeen consonants obtained thus, the Indian scribes added seventeen secondary, while to form the vowels they combined the systems of the North As\u00f3ka and the Greek; from the first they adopted the medial symbols, and from the latter the initial. He considers that both the North and South As\u00f3ka were introduced at a date later than that of Alexander the Great, in the reign of Chandragupta, about 330 to 325 B.C., for the purposes of a Prakrit Language; but for the Sanskrit Language it was not used till after 250 B.C., and that the Vedic literature was not committed to writing until after that date. As if not satisfied with the amount of antagonism aroused by his Palaeographical novelties, Hal\u00e9vy turns round, and stirs up another nest of hornets by the\nsuggestion that the Vedic hymns were not even themselves composed till after the invasion of Alexander the Great.\n\nUp to this point all the advocates of the Semitic origin of the Indian Alphabet, whose opinions we have quoted, have admitted, directly or indirectly, that the Phenician Alphabet, to which by one way or other they have traced it back, was at some remote period previously derived from the Hieratic form of the Egyptian Hieroglyphics, and it would have been unnecessary to allude to that point in this controversy but for the fact that Prof. Deecke of Strasburg in the XXXIst volume of the Journal of the German Oriental Society, p. 102, has asserted that the Semitic Alphabet is derived from the Assyrian Cuneiform Syllabary, and in the same volume of that Journal, page 598, goes on to prove the South As\u00f3ka Alphabet is derived from the South Semitic Alphabet. At p. 612 he sums up his argument that the South As\u00f3ka and Himyaritic Alphabets exhibit such a close relation, that they must have both derived their origin from the same Mother Alphabet, which however at page 599 he admits is only an hypothetical Alphabet. As a proof of this connection he cited the whole appearance of the letters, their regularity, stiffness, uniformity of size, as well as other peculiar features. It is not possible in his opinion to derive one from the other. As part of the argument rests upon the connection of the early Semitic Alphabet with the Cuneiform characters, it is necessary to notice this theory separately, although he arrives at the same conclusion as those who adopt Burnell\u2019s second possibility.\n\nAll the writers previously cited advocate either an indigenous, or a Western, origin to the South As\u00f3ka, but in the last few years a new theory has been propounded by Prof. Terrien de La Couperie of an Eastern origin, and as this has been distinctly stated in a paper read by him at a Meeting of the Royal Asiatic Society, June 20, 1881, \u201cOn the Sinico-Indian origin of the Indo-Pali writing\u201d (which has not hitherto been published), and as this theory was alluded to in the discussion at the Leyden Congress by Rhys Davids, it is necessary that his argument should be clearly stated. I applied to the\nauthor for a brief statement of his theory, and he informed me that he proposed soon to publish a paper on the subject, and referred me to the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. XIV. n.s. I had not the pleasure of hearing the paper read, but I find that in the issue of the \"Academy\" of the subsequent week, it is stated that the author gave reasons for rejecting both the theory of an indigenous, and of a Semitic origin, and pointed out that historical facts as well as traditions demonstrated that relations did exist between India and China as early as the third Century B.C. He considered that the Indo-Pali or South As\u00f3ka Alphabet had been systematized from an older system of writing consisting on the borders of China of a certain number of Chinese characters used phonetically for commercial purposes. This statement was supplied to the Secretary of the Society by the author, and in the above-quoted volume of the Journal of the R.A.S. at page 123, in a paper on a Lolo Manuscript, the same author finds an intimate connection of the characters used by the Lolo, a tribe, subject to, but not ethnologically connected with, the Chinese in the province of Se-chuen, with the characters on the stone seal found at Harapa near Lahore, already alluded to in page 335, and a remote affinity with the Indo-Pali. In a paper in the same volume, p. 802 and 803 (note), on \"The Yh-King and its Authors,\" he remarks: \"The influence of the advanced civilization and the mixture of the Ugro-Altaic early Chinese immigrants with the native population of China were not confined to the area of their political power... The phonetic writing, propagated by the Chinese immigrants, was eagerly adopted by the active and intelligent population of the South-West: in 1109 A.D. the Annamites had a phonetic writing, and in several instances we have tidings bearing on the existence of such writings, composed of a great number of Chinese simple characters used according to the phonetic principle disused by the Chinese. These simple characters, selected by progressive elimination of the less easy to draw and to combine, formed a special script, of which we knew several offshoots, and have been, as far as affinities of shape, sound and tra-\ndition are to be trusted, the Grundschrift with which has been framed that splendid monument of phonetic lore, the South Indian Alphabet, or Lat-Pali.\u201d In this age we have so many startling theories, and still more wonderful facts, that I must be excused if I hold my breath for a time, and suspend my judgment, until the paper appears in extenso.\n\nIt is clear from the above r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that we are a long way from finality, and indeed that each year puts us further off, as new theories are started. A sudden find of Inscriptions may alter the whole position of the controversy, and introduce new facts, engender new doubts, or establish new convictions. I must protest against the assertion that the direction of writing adopted by the Greeks, Romans and Indians is more natural, convenient and facile, than that of the Semitic Alphabets, as some writers, who know India by books only, maintain. Having practical knowledge of the use of the pen either way, right to left, or left to right, I think otherwise. The right arm is more free to act when it commences its work outstretched, and works towards the left, as a barber uses his razor. If I required in my Indian office a letter to be written quickly, I should have entrusted the duty to an Indian Clerk, who used the Arabic, and not the N\u00e1gari, character.\n\nMany who will read these pages have, like myself, been familiar for a quarter of a century with the Arabic and N\u00e1gari characters, not as a pleasing and interesting study, but as the necessities of our daily drudgery as Magistrates, Collectors, and Judges in Northern India. If our Proceedings and Petitions were drawn up in the Arabic, all the village accounts, all the shopkeepers\u2019 ledgers, the majority of title-deeds, and all bankers\u2019 letters of credit were in some form or other, horribly degraded, and miserably written, of the Indian Alphabet, one of the descendants of the South As\u00f3ka. When I state that the affairs of one hundred millions are managed and recorded in one or other or both at the same time of these Alphabets, the case is not overstated. Every officer of Government, European or Native, is expected to be able to understand one: some few officers\ncan write both: many officers can read both, setting aside the documents that were extremely badly written, and this last remark would equally apply to badly-written Roman. Now if any one twenty years ago had told me in India that the three characters, which I was simultaneously using, the Roman, the Arabic, and the N\u0101gari, came from the same source and within historical times, notably since the composition of Homer's poems, I should have laughed in his nose, and yet by the sure and safe process of historical and palaeographical induction and comparison, the fact in my opinion is nearly as certain as the second amazing fact, that the three languages which I promiscuously, and without effort, used in the transaction of business, English, Persian and Hindi, came from the same Mother Language beyond any possible human doubt, this fact being admitted by all.\n\nAfter sending the above pages to the Press, it was intimated to me that, as I had made a criticism of the opinions of all the authorities, I was bound to express a distinct opinion of my own upon the issues raised: I accordingly record the following, that\n\nI. The Indian Alphabet is in no respect an independent invention of the People of India, who, however, elaborated to a marvellous extent a loan, which they had received from others.\n\nII. The idea of representing Vowel and Consonant Sounds by symbols of a pure alphabetic character was derived from Western Asia beyond any reasonable doubt.\n\nIII. The germs of the Indian Alphabet are possibly to be found in the Phenician Alphabet, from which beyond doubt sprung independently the Greek and Arabic Alphabets: the origin of the Phenician Alphabet is to be found in the Hieratic form of the Egyptian Hieroglyphics.\n\nIV. It cannot be ascertained with certainty, upon the evidence before us, by what channel, or through which branch, of the Phenician Alphabet-stem India received either the idea or the germs.\nART. XVII.\u2014The Yi king of the Chinese, as a book of Divination and Philosophy. By the Rev. Dr. Edkins, M.R.A.S.\n\nAn important point in the study of the Yi king is the recognition of its existence before Wen wang's time. The elements of main difference between the Yi king of the early dynasties and that of Wen wang was in the order of the Kwa. The same names were current, and probably the admonitory remarks were, many of them, the same also. These remarks are all anonymous, and we are at liberty to guess who wrote them. The appendices are anonymous also, and they may have mainly been written by men before the time of Confucius. The three sages, Wen wang, Ch'en kung, and Confucius, were all editors, and Fu hi the original author.\n\nAs Fu hi is supposed by tradition to have lived about 3020 B.C., before the invention of the plough, in the days when men's occupations were mainly hunting and fishing, he belongs to what is called the Mythic period. He may, however, have really existed, and perhaps the preferable hypothesis respecting him is that he was a Chinese and lived in China. At least this is the Chinese notion. The part that Babylonia, Susiana, and Bactria had in helping forward the early progress of China in knowledge and the arts would be by successive contributions of information at different times. The early acquaintance of the Chinese with astronomy, their calendar, their cycles, and their symbols used in writing, are best accounted for in this way. Possibly foreigners settled in China on each occasion of the intro-\n\n1 If we adopt the assumption of Chinese native chronology, which makes the year B.C. 104, when the winter solstice occurred on the day Kia Tai, the 17th year in the 44th cycle, and regard the first cycle as commencing in the 8th year of Hwang ti, we obtain B.C. 2757 as the eighth year of Hwang ti. To this add Shen nung 140, Fu hi 116 years.\nduction of western information. But I am inclined to the supposition that the early emperors recognized by the Chinese were all natives. A period of four thousand years is not too much for the growth of a language like the Chinese. During the whole of the third millennium before Christ the Chinese race may very well have been in their present home, and Fu hi may have been a Chinese born in the country. He may, as the Chinese say, have invented the practice of divination by the milfoil, and have acted among his countrymen and subjects as a prophet. The third appendix to the Yi king tells us that (Legge, p. 382) Fu hi worked at the brilliant forms exhibited in the sky, that is, the sun, moon, and stars, and at the shapes or figures which presented themselves on the earth. He then looked at the feathers and hair of birds and beasts, and examined plants and trees, whose appearances vary according to the season of the year and the locality in which they are found. He took note of what is in the body whether physical or moral. He also looked forth on what is beyond man to whatever class of being it may belong. He then made the Pa kwa, etc.\n\nThis description may be taken to mean that this ancient emperor of five millenniums ago accomplished much towards the formation of a system of writing, in addition to the invention of the Pa kwa. Ting nan hu of the Ming dynasty says, the invention of writing is attributed by every one to Tsang kie, and it is not said that it originated with Fu hi. If Tsang kie was an officer of Hwang ti, it will be right to say that Fu hi commenced making the characters, and that they were completed in the time of Tsang kie. Or it may be said that Tsang kie was an officer of the emperor Fu hi. All this is now beyond the reach of research.\n\nWhether we assign to Fu hi a share in the invention of the characters or not, we must, if we would retain for him the invention of the Pa kwa, exclude rigorously from our chronology all extravagant elements not belonging to classical and primitive tradition. Thus, in Lie ts\u00ef, we are told (ch. vii. p. 9) that Fu hi lived more than 30,000 years\nago. He also says (chap. ii. p. 16), Fu hi, N\u00fc kwa, Shen nung and Hia Heu (founder of the Hia dynasty) had snake bodies, human faces, buffalo heads, and tiger noses. This Tauist author belongs to an age of fictitious literature, and is, indeed, himself the oldest extant example of it. His account of the fairy islands is so like a tale of foreign origin that our only doubt need be as to whether this story entered China by Bactria or Cochin China (ch. v. pp. 3, 4). Cyrus had taken Babylon and established the Persian empire in the century before Lie ts\u00ef. The eyes of the Tauist philosophers were intently fixed on the west. It would be by the importation of Babylonian or Hind\u00fa tradition that Lie ts\u00ef would imagine the existence of a god of the north called Gugom, a vast circumambient ocean bathing the shores of the world and monsters swimming about with vast islands on their heads. These he mentions in connexion with Fu hi and Shen nung. He must have seen Babylonian mythological pictures with figures half man and half fish. He wrote in a spirit of greedy credulity, without cool insight, his aim being to help in leading his countrymen to aspire after moral perfection by living in a land of dreams and practising an ascetic life.\n\nWe must reject Tauist stories, because the standpoint of the authors is not satisfactory. The historical instinct belongs in China only to the Confucian school. The clustering of myths around the early Chinese emperors and their times began, however, before the days of Lau ts\u00ef. Thus we find romance commencing about b.c. 1000 in the time of Mu wang, and in Kwan ts\u00ef b.c. 680 we have mentioned (ch. xxiii. p. 6) a personage called Chui jen, who in the folklore of those days, when P\u2019an ku was unknown, served as a first ancestor of the human race and as first instructor in cookery.\n\nRejecting mere folklore and Tauist stories, we will follow the admitted ancient works and treat the traditions of the Yi king and all the older classics as the true primitive tradition of China. We may then with a certain confidence regard Fu hi as a real man, who lived about b.c. 3000, but had neither the body of a fish nor the nose of a tiger, yet taught his countrymen useful arts, and, believing in divination, taught them this also.\nThe Yi king reads like a genuine relic of ancient times. It has the tone and colouring of high antiquity in the text and older appendices. There is a marked absence of myth. The persons mentioned are real. The incidents bear the stamp of actuality. There is poetry and imagination, but it is never mythological. In these respects it is like the Book of Odes, which contains no Taoist element, and no myths like those of the post-Confucian period. The celestial emperor, the earthly emperor, and the human emperor, myths of the later Han period, imported from western countries after the time of Christ, are entirely foreign to the Chinese classics, as they were entirely unknown to the ancient Chinese people. The same is true of P\u2019an ku. The Yi king belongs to a time when all such personages were in the future; it is, itself, a truthful picture of ancient China and may be fearlessly referred to as descriptive of what the country was, chiefly in the second millennium before Christ.\n\nThe Shwo kwa chwen, or appendix V. in Legge\u2019s translation, is mentioned by him as containing one mythological passage. It is remarkable that this appendix was lost, and was afterwards found about B.C. 30, by a woman in the wall of an old house. This was after the time when King fang introduced the principle of applying a kwa to each of the twelve months. Perhaps there has been manipulation in this appendix, after it left the hands of Confucius.\n\nThe first great school of Yi king interpretation was in fact introduced by King fang\u00b9 and rests on the application of the symbols of this book to physical nature as its pivot. We see the effect of this in the explanation of the Fu kwa the 24th. Instead of being an affair of a returning seventh day as in the text, it is applied to the eleventh month, and strictly limited to the time of the winter solstice. It suited the ideas of the Han period to apply the Yi king to symbolize the seasons and the phenomena of day and night,\n\n\u00b9 King fang again is said by critics to have derived his views from Meng hi, also of the Han dynasty. But King fang is the more prominent figure. The imperial calendar, published annually, is profoundly influenced by his opinions.\nbut this was not known to Confucius. In the tenth and eleventh centuries, Ch'en t'wan, a Tauist, and Shan yan fu, a Confucianist, founded a new school by introducing what they called the Sien tien chi hio doctrine of the early heaven, meaning by this name the teaching of Fu hi. Shan yan fu aimed to restore the primitive order of the characters, but he failed, in the judgment, at least, of Man si ho, who attacked him vigorously, saying that in placing heaven in the south, earth in the north, fire in the east, and water in the west, he had merely followed the leading of the Tauist Wei pe yang, the alchemist of the second century. The celebrated commentator Ch'eng yi adopted the principles of moral philosophy (Li hio) in opposition to those of Shan yan fu (Shu hio, doctrine of numbers). The authors of Chien lung's catalogue ascribe to Man si ho the merit of founding a new school in the 17th century, on the principles of accurate criticism of Chinese antiquity.\n\nThe Seventh Kwa, Sh\u00ef, Army.\n\nTo obtain the correct sense of the Yi king, our best course is to view it as a collection of fragments added to, from time to time, by court diviners.\n\nFor instance, we have before us the 7th hexagram \u8c61\u738b. This consists of two parts, (k'an) kham and (kwun) khon. The whole is sh\u00ef, an army. The lower three lines are called kham, a sinking cavity. The upper three are k'on, earth, submission. Let us suppose that an army is about to set out on an expedition. The emperor orders the diviners to inform him by their methods what will be the success of the expedition. The diviner takes his fifty straws. He manipulates them in a variety of ways, till he obtains a certain figure of six lines. He finds that the 7th kwa, Sh\u00ef, army, is the answer to his inquiry. This he has to interpret. He has before him in the first place three symbols, sh\u00ef, k'am, k'un, coming down from the author of the eight kwa. They mean 'army,' 'many,' 'to lead an army,' for the whole hexagram, 'danger,' 'water,' for the lower three strokes, and 'earth'\nand 'submission' for the upper. As a rule, thus much was common to the three divining guide books in use at the court of the Cheu dynasty.\n\nIn addition, there were remarks inserted in the books by previous diviners. These remarks were anonymous, but in the Cheu li, as the Yi king of the Cheu dynasty was called, it was understood that a good many of these remarks came from Wen wang, the ancestral founder, and Cheu kung, the legislator of that dynasty.\n\nThe 7th hexagram is explained thus: \"Army. If the leader be correct in character and views, there will be good fortune. No need to fear.\" This may be from Wen wang, or from some ancient diviner and adopted by Wen wang. It may be an admonition based on the experience of some early occasion.\n\nThe admonition in the lowest line states \"that at the beginning of action (c'hu) there is weakness (feminine element). Let the army go out according to rule. If badness be present, there will be misfortune.\"\n\nSecond line. Male element (nine indicates this). Seat of power (the second line of a trigram is usually the seat of power of subordinates). When he is in the midst of the army, luck, no fear. The king has given command three times.\n\nThis was probably inserted in some case of divination, when the general had received commands from the emperor on three different occasions with honour specially bestowed each time. It would be in the Shang dynasty.\n\nThird line. Dark element (six) (combined with danger) in the third place (over the male element). If the soldiers bring back their dead in carriages, it will be unlucky, with this arrangement of the straws.\u00b9\n\nFourth line. Dark element. Fourth place. For the army to retreat a stage will be not unlucky.\u00b2\n\nFifth line. Dark element. Place of the general, who is\n\n\u00b9 Certainly there must be an allusion to some fatal engagement, some actual event not on record. By the care of we know not what old diviner the admonition is preserved.\n\n\u00b2 A stage is 30 li or about five miles, as in the sun's path a stage is 30 degrees.\nhere warned that when there are birds in the field, and they can be easily captured, there will be luck. If he place eminent persons in command of troops, and then allow ordinary men to convey the slain in carriages, even though such men are correct in character, there must be ill luck.\\(^1\\)\n\nSixth line. Dark element in the last and closing scene. The emperor gives orders to reward the army. The rule of states and clans is assigned to the deserving. Let not the bad be admitted to office.\\(^2\\)\n\nIf the hypothesis of a foreign vocabulary be adopted, all the help we get from the relative position of the lines, and their elemental significance as belonging to light or darkness, is completely lost, and the concatenation of the thoughts shut out from view. Thus, submission characterizes the three upper lines, which prophesy the close of the expedition. Danger marks the three lower lines, which admonish the general in regard to the first part of the experiences of the campaign.\n\nIf the three ruling ideas of the hexagram and its constituent trigrams belonged to them before the time of Wen wang B.C. 1150, as Chinese authors assume to be the case, we may then view the Yi king as truly belonging to the Hia and Shang dynasties. It was at that time used as a book of divination, and was regarded as essential to the administration of affairs. To make it begin to be a divining book with the time of Wen wang is to interfere too rudely with the smooth consecutiveness of ancient Chinese history.\n\nThis will be seen by foreign students with increasing clearness, in proportion as the Tso chwen comes to take its right position as the most important historical work we possess on the period with which it deals.\n\nLet us take as an instance of the value of the Tao chwen,\n\n\\(^1\\) Here we meet with enigmatical language. The birds are real persons. The slain carried with the army in its retreat (an unlucky thing to do) embraces also other unlucky actions.\n\n\\(^2\\) The sense is well connected throughout these admonitions and prophecies, if we only make allowance for the mode of composition. The remarks were gradually collected in the official divining book, and finally issued from the hands of Wen Wang and his son in this form. The Siang appendix supports the interpretation I have given.\nand of the helpful light of history, a case of divination in the year B.C. 596, as recorded in Legge's Ch'un ts'ieun, pp. 312, 317. When armies went out, it was necessary to divine and this on both sides. In pages 311, 316 there are examples of divination on the part of the Cheng people. A few pages later occurs an extract from the Yi king, which shows how it was used at that time. Si\u00fcn sheu, an officer in charge of one brigade of the Tsin armies then put in motion to invade Chang, said, \"The army is in danger according to the Cheu yi now consulted; the hexagram Shi was obtained, consisting of danger below and submission above. This changed to lim 'coming down upon,' consisting of marsh below and submission above. The admonition of the altered line, the lowest line of the 7th hexagram, says if the army go out not according to rule, but with misconduct, there will be evil. For the general to be submissive in carrying through his duties is good conduct. To fail in submission is misconduct. The many (Kam, many) are scattered and the army becomes weak. The river (symbolized by K'am 'water') becomes a marsh (tui the new trigram, which takes the place of kam) by increase of obstructions. The rules are not obeyed, and are made subservient to a capricious will. Therefore it is said that in carrying out the rules there is misconduct. Further the rules are brought to nought. The full (water) becomes spent. Heaven places obstructions and prevents completeness. Therefore there is misfortune. To become standing water is the effect which proceeds from obtaining the Lim hexagram. There is a general, but the men do not obey. This is the Lim hexagram carried to its utmost limit. If we meet the foe, there will be a great defeat. Chi ts'i will be the representative person to be visited by this calamity. Though he should escape death and return home, he must there sustain great evils.\"\n\nHere we see how thoroughly the main idea of each group of lines, as suggested by its name, pervades the interpretation. The prophesying power of the Yi king is in the groups of lines still more than in the text or letter-press description. Both are necessary parts of the Yi king and\nthe Appendices are another necessary part. But the most authoritative, original, and essential ideas are those involved in the three names of the eight kwa and of the 64 kwa. In this case submission, belonging to each of the six lines, belongs therefore to the bottom line, which is taken by the lot in this instance. The single line possesses the qualities of both the lower and upper trigram. It has also the qualities of the new trigram which is obtained by later manipulation. The meaning of the new line obtained is made up of four factors. Sh\u012b \u2018army,\u2019 ka\u2019m \u2018water,\u2019 k\u2019un \u2018submission\u2019 tui \u2018marsh.\u2019 This is the reason why the diviner thinks still more of Fu hi than of Wen wang. The eight names and 64 names, which are supposed to be pregnant with prophetic meaning, are all attributed to Fu hi. Fu hi has a real share in the exposition of the sense; and when the Chinese speak of the three sages who compiled this work, they mean Fu hi, Wen wang and Confucius.\n\nThe Fifteenth Kwa, K\u2019ien, Humility.\n\nA second example of a hexagram will be now presented. I take advantage again of M. Terrien de Lacouperie\u2019s article on the Yi king and its Authors, and select one of those which he has there treated in detail, the 15th, the kwa of humility. I do this in order that the reader may be able to refer to the Chinese characters and the four translations collected by the industrious care of M. de Lacouperie, and placed before the reader at one view.\n\nKwa of humility \u2631. Stopping or mountain belongs to the lower trigram, and here is the commencement of action. Submission and earth belong to the upper trigram, and characterize the later stages of action.\n\nThe diviner\u2019s admonition in reference to the whole hexagram says, \u201cPerseverance. The noble actor will in the end succeed in his enterprise.\u201d No doubt the diviner, in saying this to the person who consulted him, had in view the union of the three ideas, definiteness, submission, humility. Wen wang when he wrote these words, or adopted them from an ancient diviner, which is more probable, was simply stating\nwhat he understood Fu hi to mean by the names. In the Shang dynasty Yi king the character ki'en had no radical, but it was probably then pronounced k'am, and meant 'humble.'\n\nFirst line. Weakness (broken line) or the dark element is at the beginning. But the noble actor is humble in two respects (mountain below earth, and he himself at the foot of mountain). He will therefore be successful in crossing (k'am, water) the great stream (formed by the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th lines).\n\nSecond line. (This is the seat of power.) Dark element. His humility is spoken of by many. He is correct in purpose, and lucky on this account.\n\nThird line. The noble actor, who is both meritorious and humble, will be lucky in the end.\u00b9\n\nFourth line. Weak element. But (being immediately above so strong a position as the third line) he will prosper in everything. Still he must be careful to maintain his humility.\n\nFifth line. Weak. He is not rich, but by help of his neighbours he can successfully make assaults. Wherever he fights, it will be with success.\n\nSixth line. Weak. The general voice proclaims him humble. He can successfully depart with his troops, but (not being in the seat of authority, as is shown by the fifth weak line) he attacks only the cities of his own state.\u00b2\n\nA third example will now be taken.\n\n\u00b9 As the diviner studies the kwa which he has obtained as the result of his eighteen manifestations, he instructs the person who consults him in the meaning of each of the six lines. In this case the main idea, humility, recurs in each line except the fifth. In determining the significance of the third line, an undivided one, he quite possibly took into consideration that it made k'am, water, if joined with the line above and below it; and chen, thunder, if joined to the two lines above it, as native commentators explain things. He looked on the unbroken lines as a sign of strength, and then the combination of strength with humility brought before his consciousness the conception of an actor of noble qualities, who must in the end be successful.\n\n\u00b2 There is nothing very abrupt or improbable in the native interpretation of this kwa. There is a concatenation in the admonitions on the separate lines. The building of the admonitions on the essential primary meaning of the trigrams and hexagram is obvious. There appears to be no call to accept the hypothesis of a vocabulary. This hypothesis is disproved by the obvious concatenation of the sense in the several lines. Legge's translation seems to be sustained, and so also is the supposition that Wen wang found in the old Yi king the main purport of the trigrams and hexagram almost complete.\nTHIRTIETH KWA, LI.\n\nAgain I refer to M. Terrien de Lacouperie's article, Journal, Vol. XV. Part II. p. 270, for the Chinese text and four parallel translations.\n\nThis kwa is made use of in the 1st section of the latter half of the Hi t'si appendix. Pan hi made nets for his people to use in hunting and fishing with the help of this kwa. He may, after the nets were made, have detected a resemblance between the holes of nets and the open spaces in the divided lines of this kwa. The simple study of the lines of the kwa would not of itself suggest how a net was to be made. But this is how things are put.\n\nIn li a divided line in the middle is flanked by two undivided lines. The prominent idea is brightness. The middle line represents substance, and is weak. The outer lines are the signs of action, and are strong. The consulter is told by the diviner in the general admonition that correct conduct insures continued success. In nourishing the cow (a patient and docile animal, here introduced as a symbol of submission) luck will be insured.\n\nBrightness is doubled in this kwa. Weakness is flanked on both sides by power. There must be correct conduct and patient docility as in the cow. The other prominent idea in the word li is attachment to. Fire must be attached to something, as plants to the earth, and the heavenly bodies to the sky.\n\nWhen the admonition was first written, there must have been a cow in the possession of the consulter. The admonition would then appear natural.\n\nFirst line. Action begins with the strong element. The shoe or your stepping is entangled or confused. Be careful. There will be no error.\n\nHere the word for \"straw sandal,\" and \"to tread,\" is used, though in the ascending tone. We know that the tone was different from that of li, brightness, attached. The diviner may have introduced the word sandal as homophonous, although the tone differed. All the help he could get in\ninterpreting the kwa was embraced under the one word li in all or any of its meanings. He had no aid from the trigrams, they being the same with the hexagram. I do not know why Legge, McClatchie, and Regis have avoided the word sandal in this place. Probably both sandal and the action of treading were before the writer's mind.\n\nSecond line. Weak element in the centre. The yellow Li bird. Great good fortune.\n\nI take this from M. Terrien de Lacouperie. Diviners in those times had scarcely learned to make use of the philosophy of the five elements in the way which Chinese expounders here assume that they have done. I suppose the diviner to have seen the yellow li bird on the occasion. As its name agreed in sound with the kwa, he accepted it as a good omen.\n\nThird line. Strong element in the 3rd place. The shining of the setting sun is the symbol. If not saluted by beating earthen pans and singing, there will be heard the sighing of the tottering old man. The omen is unfortunate.\n\nHere the diviner is thinking of the end of the day. The trigram is a day, and the third line is its close. The man who consulted the milfoil was perhaps aged. Or the diviner introduced an old man whom he saw. The old must die. It is either a joyful event to be greeted with singing or a sorrowful one to provoke sighing. The diviner takes the sun shining in the evening as an omen, limiting himself to sense \"brightness\" found in the name of the kwa. The omen means death.\n\nFourth line. Strong element at the beginning of the second period of action. He comes with sudden rush, like the burning of a fire, like death, as if to be rejected.\n\nThis is the beginning of the second day in the diviner's statement, which assumes the form of prophecy.\n\nFifth line. Weakness on the throne. A shower of tears shows how sad he is. He will have good fortune.\n\nThe tears are those of self-condemnation and a new resolution.\n\nSixth line. Strength at the end. The king in action.\nHe leads out an army. He obtains fame. He kills the chiefs and merely makes prisoners of those who were not fellow-rebels.\\(^1\\)\n\nWe cannot resign the help given to the explanation of the kwa by the relative position of the lines as shown in the preceding interpretation. The hypothesis of a vocabulary does not seem therefore admissible.\n\n**Thirty-first Kwa, Hien.**\n\nThis is the kwa of mutual influence, and refers to marriage. The separate trigrams are ken, mountain, below, and tui, marsh, above. The weak lines are 1, 2, and 6. The strong lines are 3, 4, and 5.\n\nThe mutual influence is that of conjugal affection. The constituent elements are stopping (which indicates entire devotion) on the part of the husband and smiling consent on the part of the wife.\n\nGeneral admonition. Mutual influence. Perseverance. Benefit. Correctness. To take a wife will be fortunate.\n\nThis is one of those kwa which is taken to represent the human body, and the separate lines indicate the parts of the body from the toes to the face.\n\nFirst line. Weakness. Beginning of action. Movement begins in the great toe.\n\nSecond line. Weakness in the second place. Movement in the calf will be unfortunate. In rest there will be good fortune.\n\nThird line. Firmness in the upper part of the mountain. Movement in the thigh. Keeping hold of the person following. Advancing will be regretted.\n\nFourth line. Firmness in the first line of march. Correct\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) A Chinese friend, to whom I referred some points in the interpretation of the six admonitions or prophecies in this kwa, recommended me in the first line to keep in view both meanings of the word li, sandal, viz. as a verb to tread on, and as a noun sandal. With this I agree, for divination is enigmatical and often ambiguous. The ambiguity consists in taking one or more words in two senses. Diviners love ambiguity, because whichever sense is verified by the event, the correctness of the divination is confirmed, and every diviner is naturally interested in the success of his own divination.\nconduct. Good fortune. No repentance. Restless movements back and forth. Only his friends follow him.\n\nFifth line. Firmness in the post of honour and power. Movement in the flesh lying along the spine. No repentance.\n\nSixth line. Weakness in the end of the action. Movement in the jaws and tongue.\n\nThe object is to divine respecting some proposed marriage. Would it be fortunate? In the progress of the eighteen manipulations it struck the diviner that in the diagram drawn by him in accordance with the result of those manipulations, there was a rude representation of the human body, from the feet to the head. Each line represented a portion of the body. Each part he viewed as subject in succession to influence as expressed in the name of the kwa, kam, to affect. The feet, the heart, and the tongue are set in motion by feeling. The effect and nature of the movements of the parts of the body in succession are adduced as affording indications of what would be the good or ill fortune of the man whom the diviner had in his eye. The general admonition is on marriage. The scope of the six particular admonitions is wider. It embraces the influence of nature on the human body and the orderly movement of the limbs in their mutual connexion. On this depends the repute a man has among his friends.\n\nPerhaps it would be well to regard the six particular admonitions as based not on the idea of marriage at all, but on the name kan, influence, under which heading marriage furnishes one example. In the remarks of the second appendix, Hi t'si hia chwen, there is not a word of marriage. It was the destiny of the Yi king to become changed early into a book of philosophy, and here is an instance where a kwa, which originally proclaimed good or ill fortune attending marriages, modified its tone so that it became the teacher of the influence of the superior man as set forth in the remarks here referred to in the 2nd Appendix.\nKwan is stated in the Er ya to be K\u2019iue, the side opening in the gateway of a palace or ancestral temple. The diviner who wrote the general admonition to this kwa had before his mind a sacrifice. This would be suggested by the circumstance that it was on occasion of a proposed sacrifice that he was called to manipulate with the milfoil. But as the name kwan was already given to the kwa, the diviner who wrote the particular admonitions added such remarks in each case as appeared to him to come naturally out of the meaning of the kwa name.\n\nDivination existed in the earliest times, and every kwa would acquire a name in accordance with the results of the earliest divination. In this case the kwa became, in the first instance, that of \u201cseeing,\u201d \u201cgazing.\u201d The earliest recorded addition which now remains to this kwa is the general admonition, and the six particular admonitions would follow at a later period. In each case, when an entry was made in the divining book, the diviner would endeavour to gain aid, in shaping his admonition or prophecy, from the meanings of the kwa name, and the ideas suggested by the relative position of the lines. In the general admonition, the meaning \u201cwash hands\u201d is used. In the admonitions attached to the lines the meanings are all varieties of the original seeing or gazing. We are warranted in concluding that the application of this kwa to sacrifices was specially primitive, and that it was by later diviners applied to the emperor, the courtiers, and the palace.\n\nGeneral admonition or prophecy. Seeing. He washes his hands previous to offering the sacrifices. He is trustworthy and dignified.\n\nFirst line. Weakness at the outer and lower stage in the scene. Boys looking. The matter belongs to inferior men. There is no fault. For the superior man there is cause for regret.\n\nSecond line. Weakness at the second gateway. Looking\nat the prince. There is advantage in connexion with such women as these. Their deportment is correct.\n\nThird line. Weakness at the third stage. Those who are at this stage should look at their own life. They will then know whether to advance or to retreat.\n\nFourth line. Weakness. Stage the fourth (where the king, who is at the fifth stage, can be seen). Here he looks at the glory of the kingdom. It will be advantageous for him to be guest with the king.\n\nFifth line. Strength. Place of honour. (The king speaks), Look at my mode of life. (The diviner says to the consulter), Such a man is the superior man, and you, if you so act, will be without fault.\n\nSixth line. Strength. Highest stage of progress. He who looks at the king's life (and imitates it) will be a superior man without fault.\n\nThe whole scene presents the king on his throne as the object of contemplation. There are five stages of contemplation. Men of low origin peep from the outer door. Women peep from a nearer position. Men in office are near the king, as are those who aspire to be guests. The king himself is on the throne, here represented by the fifth line.\n\nIt is necessary in divination for any kwa to become applicable to new circumstances. Here the sacrifices of the general admonition are lost sight of altogether. The whole attention of the diviner is bent on a court scene, where the centre figure is a good and noble prince. Probably there is an allusion to some ancient emperor, as in the \"Song of the five children\" there is a description of the virtues of the emperor Y\u00fc, which would in its tone agree very well with the character of the ideal emperor here portrayed. But it might be the emperor Cheng Tang, or Pang keng, or Wu ting of the Shang dynasty. If Cheu kung, for instance, drew his materials from the Lien shan yi, it would be Y\u00fc ti that is referred to. If from the Kwei tsang yi, it would be one of the three Shang emperors just mentioned. It could not, I think, be one of the five children, as supposed by M. Terrien de Lacouperie, because they were not seated on\nthe throne, and the name Kwan was applied to all the five brothers. The coincidence is probably a mere accident.\n\nThe ideas attached to Kwan in the court scene require us to suppose that the diviner thought of it as an outer and second gate, as a verb to gaze, and as also meaning to wash. It does not appear to be used here as a proper name of the king who might be on the throne at the time.\n\n**The Thirteenth Kwa, Tung Jen, Associated Friends.**\n\nThe diviner has before him to help in interpretation the ancient name of the whole kwa, associated friends, and its parts, li, fire, below, at the beginning of action, and k'ien, heaven, above, completing the action.\n\nIn the tenth century, when the Tang emperor Fei ti invested the city Tai yuen, the Tsin emperor Kau tsu in his distress commanded Ma chung tsi to consult the milfoil. This officer went through the eighteen manipulations and obtained the 13th kwa. His statement to his sovereign was as follows. Firmness above and brightness below. The ruler's virtues are bright. The people in the south look towards him, and he obtains the empire. There must in these circumstances be associated friends to help him. Kien is the north-west. The Yi king says there is fighting in Kien. Li is the south. The Yi king says there is meeting in Li. Those who come to help us are in the north-west. Kien is the kwa of the ninth and tenth month. The victory ought to be won at the union of these months.\n\nIn accordance with this prediction, the Kie tan Tartars helped the Tsin emperor and defeated the Tang army in the ninth month.\n\nIn the primitive divination, so far as we know, the kwa were not divided among the months. Nor does it seem clear that the Shwo kwa chwen, which places the eight kwa round the compass in the positions chen east, sun south-east, li south, kwun south-west, tui west, kien north-west, ka'n north, kou north-east, was written before the time of Confucius. But it would be hypercritical to deny that this was\nthe order of the kwa in the Cheu yi. Supposing the Shwo kwa chwen were a late addition, this part of it would not be likely to be an innovation. The elemental philosophy required this arrangement, and it was under the influence of this philosophy that Wen wang wrote.\n\nThe position of the diviner in Wen wang's days would differ therefore from that of the diviner in the tenth century after Christ, mainly in regard to the application to months. The three leading ideas, Tung jen, heaven, fire, would be the same for each.\n\nThe Tung jen could not mean Troglodytes, because the appendices agree with the text in assigning to the words the sense, associated friends, and as the text is much of it older than the time of Wen wang, there is no call to break with a tradition so self-consistent and so primitive.\n\nGeneral admonition. Friends are in the field. Perseverance. There will be good fortune in passing a great river. There will be a benefit secured, the chief being upright.\n\nParticular admonition on first line. Strong element at the beginning of action. Friends are at the gate. No error.\n\nSecond line. Weakness. Second place (the chief place among subordinates). That friends connect themselves in parties under leaders is cause for regret.\n\nThird line. Strength. Third place (indicates intention to seize the opportunity to attack him who is in possession of honour at the fifth place). He hides his arms in the long grass and mounts a high hillock. For three years he has remained without marching in advance.\n\nFourth line. Strength. Fourth place. Mounting the wall of the fortress, he refrains from an assault, not being able to conquer. There will be good fortune.\n\nFifth line. Strength. Place of honour and power. Friends first lament and afterwards are seen rejoicing. The great army conquers them and then they meet.\n\nSixth line. Strength. Highest line. Friends are on the outside of the city. There is nothing to regret.\nHistory does not throw light on the circumstances here alluded to. It would not be strange that these entries should have been made in reference to some unknown event in the Shang dynasty. It ought to be recollected that we mentioned in the 11th and in the 63rd kwa events which took place about B.C. 1190 and B.C. 1364 respectively.\n\nWhen once the record had been made, it was liable to become an enigma to all those who were not acquainted with contemporary events. This is the reason that the Yi king appears to be disjointed and obscure.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n\nThe diagrams being inseparable from the text of the Yi king, to view the text as consisting of vocabularies and ballads is inadmissible. The oldest part of the text that we can trace by internal chronological evidence attaches itself to B.C. 1364. Other parts may be older than this, and there is nothing decisive in the words or grammar of the text to indicate the period to which it should be referred.\n\nThe diagrams are contemporary with the invention of writing by the Chinese. The same sort of mental activity made the one which made the other. The diagrams became the vehicle for the expression of a philosophy. The characters became the basis of the national literature.\n\nThe reason why the diagrams of the Yi king became the vehicle of philosophy was that they are general symbols capable of application to new circumstances a hundred times over. But what does philosophy consist of if it be not the reduction of human knowledge to general propositions? Philosophy began very early in the world, because some men, possessing the generalizing faculty, would, in any country where civilization had made some progress, be able by a few intuitions and deductions to lay the foundations of a philosophy. The first philosophy of the Yi king was the dual, based on the strong and weak element found in nature. In the diagrams the single and double lines became symbols for the expression of some of the simpler ideas of this\nphilosophy. Then the names of the kwa became attached to them by diviners, a memento in each case perhaps of a successful divination. These names also became repositories of ideas springing out of the dual philosophy. But, as time went on, the philosophy of two contrasted elements in a single antithesis expanded itself into the system of the five elements. A philosophy whose symbols were linear became a philosophy whose symbols were circular and linear. This was the stage which philosophic progress had reached in the eleventh century before Christ, and this was the reason that Wen wang changed the order of the kwa.\n\nWhen Confucius appeared on the scene, and undertook the task of preserving the classics for posterity, what struck him most forcibly in the Yi king was its philosophy, and in the appendices he bent himself to the completion of that philosophy. He found them probably in a fragmentary state, and when they left his hand, they had assumed nearly their present form. What was in early ages a manual of divination, became by the completion of the appendices both a manual of divination and a compendium of the philosophy of the ancient sages. It was only the mind that dictated the Chung yung philosophy, that could have finished the Yi king. Native scholars have been impressed by the general similarity of tone in the Chung yung and the Appendices to the Yi king, and have unanimously regarded them as proceeding from one master mind.\n\nThe philosophy of Confucius was moral, but he preserved the elemental philosophy of Wen wang, and, having a fervent admiration of that sage, retained his system unimpaired. The Wen yen, or 4th Appendix, is cited in the Tso chwen as used A.D. 564, before Confucius was grown to man's estate, and is therefore not his. The Shwo kwa chwen, or 5th Appendix, forms a bridge between the teaching of Confucius in the old Yi king and the views of the Han dynasty writers.\n\nThe Yi king proved itself to be the mother of philosophies in the Han dynasty. King fang founded upon it the philosophy of the calendar, and Yang hiung constructed upon\nthis idea a long philosophic poem which he called the Tai hiuen king,\\(^1\\) in eighty-one sections. Each section had a kwa, and it was intended as a sort of competitor in repute with the Yi king, but the attempt has failed. An alchemical philosophy was founded by Wei pe yang on the Yi king.\n\nThe pride and admiration felt by the Chinese in the Yi king cannot therefore be wondered at, for it is the fundamental book of their philosophy. If in certain passages it is obscure, it ought to be considered whether the necessary historical elucidations are wanting. Where they exist, the Yi king is no more difficult to understand than any other ancient Chinese book.\n\n\\(^1\\) The Tai hiuen king proceeds in its 81 sections from the winter solstice through the year to the winter solstice again. The Yang principle is at its climax June 21st. It expands in spring, and contracts in autumn. The elements metal, wood, water, fire, earth, are influences in perpetual circulation, each dominating for a short time in succession. Fu hi preferred 8 and 64 as the favourite numbers of his philosophy. Yang hiung preferred 9 and 81, in this following Wen wang.\nART. XVIII.\u2014On the Arrangement of the Hymns of the Rig-veda. By Frederic Pincott, M.R.A.S.\n\nThe supreme importance of the Rig-veda in all questions bearing on the history of the Aryan mind, and on the development of the religious idea in man, gives interest to every attempt to throw light on that priceless heirloom of India. Much has already been done by able scholars, in many ways, to investigate the language and ideas enshrined in the Rig-veda-sanhita; but no one has yet discovered the principle on which the hymns are arranged among themselves, or has advanced beyond the mere consciousness expressed by Prof. Max M\u00fcller in his History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, that \"there is some system,\" \"some priestly influence,\" \"traces of one superintending spirit,\" and such-like generalities. The object of the following paper is to show the principle which regulated the formation of the Sanhita, the aggregation of hymns into Mandalas, the reason for the positions assigned to the Mandalas, and the method followed in placing each particular hymn. If my deductions prove accurate, it is evident that a fresh impetus will be given to the study of these remarkable documents, for the clue to the labyrinth will be in the hands of future investigators.\n\nProf. Max M\u00fcller gave a sound basis to the inquiry by pointing out that the division of the Rig-veda into Mandala, Anuvaka, and Sukta, is more ancient than that into Ashatka, Adhyaya, and Varga. He also called attention to the fact\nthat eight of the ten Mandalas begin with hymns addressed to the god Agni, which, in seven cases, are followed by hymns to Indra, and that these again are generally followed by hymns to the Vi\u015bvadevas. If I add to this the statement that it has been noticed that the last hundred hymns of the Rig-veda are arranged in the order of their diminishing length, I believe I have adduced all that has yet been published as to the principles governing the arrangement of these ancient poems. Indian scholars do not help us in this matter; for S\u0101yana, the great Commentator, frankly states in his Introduction to the Rig-veda, that the hymns have no principle of arrangement; and the Pandits now living in India with whom I have communicated seem just as clear on the point.\n\nThe Br\u0101hmans, however, have divided the Sanhita into five parts, in a way which proves that they were well aware of distinct differences between various portions of the collection. The five parts they name respectively \u015aatarchin, M\u0101dhyama, Prag\u0101tha, P\u0101vam\u0101ni, and the Kshudra and Mah\u0101s\u016bktas. The \u015aatarchin is a name given to the 1st Mandala, under the assumption that each Rishi contributed 100 richas, or verses, to its formation.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 The visionary character of this assumption is demonstrated by the following list of the Rishis of the 1st Mandala with the number of verses which each contributed:\n\n| NAME OF RISHI | NO. OF VERSES |\n|---------------|--------------|\n| Madhucchandas | 102          |\n| Jetri         | 8            |\n| Medh\u0101tithi    | 146          |\n| S'unab\u0113phena  | 96           |\n| Hiranyak\u1e63\u1e6dupa | 71           |\n| Kanwa        | 96           |\n| Praskanwa     | 82           |\n| Savya        | 72           |\n| Nodhas       | 74           |\n| Par\u0101\u015bara     | 91           |\n| Gotama       | 204          |\n| Kutsa        | 47           |\n| Ka\u015byapa      | 1            |\n| The Five Rishis | 19          |\n| Kutsa        | 145          |\n| Kakshivan    | 153          |\n| Paruchchhepa | 100          |\n| Dirghatamas  | 237          |\n| Agasti       | 229          |\n\nIt will be seen that only one Rishi contributed exactly 100 verses; five others\nportion comprises the whole of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th Mandalas. They are, in fact, uniform in character, and constitute the centre or corpus of the whole Sanhita. Pragatha is the name applied to the hymns of the 8th Mandala, from a consciousness that this miscellaneous collection had something exceptional in its character. The Pavanani, or purificatory hymns, are those of the 9th Mandala, all of which are addressed to the deity of the Soma juice. The 10th Mandala contains the Kshudrasukta and Mahasukta, or the short and long hymns; obviously indicating that it is a miscellaneous collection placed at the end of all the others. The facts to which the above nomenclature calls attention are indubitable, although the Indian traditional explanation of those facts may be rejected. The only amendment I propose to the Indian classification is the division of the 10th Mandala into two parts. My reasons for doing so are as follows:\u2014The hymns of the 10th Mandala are almost entirely ascribed to mythological Rishis; but the first 84 hymns are arranged according to the Rishi and the metre of the poem, and comprise the Apri hymn of the Badhyasvas. As soon as we pass the 84th hymn we find a totally different system of arrangement; Rishi and metre are disregarded, and the hymns are arranged in strict accordance with their diminishing length. Furthermore this latter cluster comprises the Apri hymn of the Bhrgus by Jamadagni. When we reflect on the high importance attached to the Apri hymns, and the tenacity with which each family clung to its own Apri-sukta, coupled with the fact that these two Apri hymns are imbedded in collections which differ entirely in their method of arrangement, it seems impossible to avoid the conclusion that the 10th Mandala consists of two collections of hymns in accidental union.\n\nroughly approximate 100 verses; but the remainder vary between the wide limits of a single verse up to no less than 237 verses. It deserves remark, however, that the term Satarchin has this slender application to these Rishis, that, of all members of their respective families, their hymns approach nearest in their total to 100 verses. This is true even of Dirghatamas with his 237 verses; for he is the nearest to 100 of any member of the Gautama family.\nI will now state the six sections into which I propose to divide the Rig-veda, and will afterwards deal with the arrangement of the individual hymns:\n\nSect. 1.\u2014The 1st Mandala. This is an eclectic ceremonial liturgy, divisible into eleven parts, connected with the offering of the Puroj\u00e2sa oblation in eleven vessels. This is why it was accorded the first place in the Sanhita; for all that follows is only supplementary to this great ceremonial. The proofs will be given further on.\n\nSect. 2.\u2014The 2nd to the 7th Mandala. These, as is well known, are the family collections of hymns, representatives from which were taken to produce the grand eclectic liturgy of the 1st Mandala.\n\nSect. 3.\u2014The Prag\u00e2tha hymns, or the 8th Mandala. This collection, as its name imports, is semi-canonical in character, and comprises the V\u00e2lakhilya, or Supplementary hymns, along with a mixed collection of hymns representing all the different families of poets. Further explanation of this will be given.\n\nSect. 4.\u2014The P\u00e2vam\u00e2ni, or Soma hymns of the 9th Mandala. This Mandala necessarily occupies a position subordinate to those which have preceded it. They contain hymns addressed to the gods themselves; this contains those celebrating the virtues of that which was offered to the gods. This is obviously the reason for its position in the Sanhita.\n\nSect. 5.\u2014Mythological hymns of the Badhya\u015bvas, comprising the first 84 hymns of the 10th Mandala.\n\nSect. 6.\u2014Mythological hymns of the Bhrigus. These last two sections comprise hymns by Rishis, nearly all of whom are mythological personages. The hymns themselves are for the most part dedicated to Agni, Indra, Vi\u015bvadevas, etc.; but there are several addressed to powers unrecognized as deities in other parts of the Rig-veda, such as the Pitris, Mrityu, to certain celestial birds and beasts, and even to Angiras, the sage. Here are also found the doubtful Purusha-s\u00fbkta, and a hymn to Dakshin\u00e2, or the presentation of alms at sacrifices;\nwe find also references to the \"seven ancient Rishis,\" and many other evidences that we are breathing a different atmosphere when among these hymns to that which surrounds us when we are among those of the earlier Mandalas. The last place in the Sanhita is properly given to these mystical and mythological poems.\n\nThe different parts of the Rig-veda are thus seen to be systematically arranged. First comes the liturgy; next the family collections of hymns; then the Supplementary hymns; then the Soma hymns; and last, the mythological poems. Now let us see if any system is discernible in the family collections of hymns themselves. We have only to arrange them under the family names of their Rishis to see the principle which dictated the order in which we find them:\n\n1. Bhrigu (Gritsamada), 2nd Mandala.\n2. Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra (Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra), 3rd Mandala.\n3. Angiras, Gautama branch (V\u0101madeva), 4th Mandala.\n   Atri (Atri), 5th Mandala.\n4. Angiras, Bharadvaja branch (Bharadvaja) 6th Mandala.\n5. Vasishtha (Vasishtha), 7th Mandala.\n6. Prag\u0101tha hymns, 8th Mandala.\n\nThese seven Mandalas evidently find their pivot in the 5th Mandala, on each side of which they are systematically arranged. The important Angiras family (under whose influence the Rig-veda seems to have been arranged) placed the hymns of its two branches one on each side of the centre. The Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra family, ever the friends of the Angiras, were placed next, balanced on the other side by their great rivals the V\u0101sishthas; while outside these again was placed, at one end, the inconsiderable collection of the Bhrigus, the shortest of the Mandalas, with the miscellaneous Prag\u0101tha collection as a counterpoise at the other extremity. Nothing could be more systematic than this. It is just what the relative importance and mutual rivalries of the families would necessitate.\n\nBut why should the hymns of Atri and his family occupy\nthe centre? This is the very key-stone of the arch; and the reason that it became such is clearly shown in the traditions of the \u00c2treyas. These traditions show an intimate connection between Atri, the Moon, and Soma. The Moon, or Soma (for the terms are almost interchangeable), was the offspring of the Rishi Atri; and hence was frequently called \u0905\u0930\u094d\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0903 or \u0905\u0930\u094d\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0903 or \u0905\u0930\u094d\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0903, terms which mean \"born of Atri,\" or \"born from the eye of Atri,\" or \"born from a glance of Atri,\" the tradition being that the Moon was produced by the flash of the eye of the Rishi Atri.\u00b9 The Moon, as we know, was the parent of Budha, the progenitor of the Lunar race, whose capital was at the famous Hastin\u0101pura, near Delhi. It is, therefore, clear that Atri was held to be the patron-saint of the Soma, and he and his race may, in fact, have had something to do with the introduction of Soma into the ritual;\u00b2 at all events, it is evident that he occupies the central position among the Mandalas as the representative of the sacred Soma, around which the other Mandalas were grouped as shown above.\n\nBefore quitting this part of the subject, it seems needful to show the subordinate character of the Prag\u00e2tha hymns, to account for their being placed in an outer position. There is first the name Prag\u00e2tha, implying that Indians are fully aware that there is something in this Mandala to distinguish it from the others. This Mandala contains the eleven V\u00e2lakhilya, or distinctly non-canonical hymns; and although the rest of the hymns are sufficiently canonical to be included in the Anukraman\u00ee, or Index, of the Rig-veda, still they are all, so to speak, branded with the epithet Prag\u00e2tha. Now a g\u00e2tha is the name of any secular or non-canonical poem. No rich, yajush, or adman verse is ever spoken of as a g\u00e2tha; for it is a term which implies human\n\n\u00b9 Colebrooke's Essays, vol. i. p. 171 (ed. 1873).\n\u00b2 It is worthy of inquiry whether the contests of the Solar and Lunar races had anything to do with the worship of the Sun and Moon. Certainly a compromise seems to have been effected in the Rig-veda, as a kind of settlement; for Soma or the Moon is accorded the posts of honour both here, and in the 1st Mandala, while hymns to Agni, Fire, or the Solar principle, are placed first in order in every arrangement of individual hymns. Thus the Moon dominates the order of the Mandalas, and the Sun rules the arrangement of the individual hymns.\nauthorship, an idea unhesitatingly rejected in the case of canonical hymns. The term prag\u0101tha implies superiority over ordinary g\u0101thas, whether that be a superiority of excellence or of antiquity. The term signifies that the hymns in question occupy an intermediate position between g\u0101thas by human authors, and the revealed verses of the Rishis. The subordinate character of this Mandala is further shown by the heterogeneity of its contents. It contains hymns of all the great families of Rishis; but not all the hymns ascribed to the Rishis included in it. It seems to give only an odd hymn or two of various Rishis, not included in the preceding Mandalas, the highest number of hymns ascribed to any one Rishi being five. There are hymns by as many as 56 Rishis in this Mandala, of whom there are 37 that can boast of only a single hymn each; 10 have but two hymns each; 3 have three hymns each; 5 have four hymns each; and 1 only has five hymns. Another noticeable fact is that the mass of these Prag\u0101tha hymns are by members of the Angiras family; a fact which supports the opinion that the Sanhita was arranged under Angiras influence, and that that family was anxious to include in the canon all the relics of their own poets, even those about the revealed character of which doubts might be entertained. The composite and fragmentary character of this Mandala, therefore, sufficiently explains the subordinate position assigned to it.\n\nBefore finally passing to an explanation of the method adopted for the arrangement of individual hymns, it is needful here to introduce the reasons which induce me to speak of the 1st Mandala as an eclectic ceremonial liturgy. If I am correct in my deductions, then we have here a very curious discovery which cannot fail to throw much light on the religion of the ancient Aryans. In my opinion we have in this Mandala the veritable prayer-book of the ancient Br\u0101hmans, rehearsed while performing the eleven acts which completed the solemn offering of the Puroj\u0101sa. The arrangement of the hymns in this Mandala enables us to indicate with certainty the supreme moment when the sacred Soma\njuice was offered. The demonstration of these bold opinions is as follows:\n\nA careful inspection of the 1st Mandala shows that it contains hymns by no less than seven of the eight great families of Rishis. There are hymns by the Vai\u015bv\u0101mitras, by both the Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja and Gautama branches of the Angirases, by the V\u0101sish\u1e6dhas, by the K\u0101\u015byapas, by the Bhar-gavas, and by the Agastyas. It is evident from this that we have in the 1st Mandala an eclectic collection of hymns; not, as in the case of the 8th Mandala, a mere heterogeneous collection of fugitive poems, but a carefully selected and systematically arranged set of hymns representing the great families of ancient Rishis. It is hardly venturesome to assert that this designed selection of hymns was intended for ceremonial purposes. For what other purpose could it be intended? Why should a pinch of hymns be taken from each of the family collections, and placed in an orderly sequence by themselves, unless for some purpose for which the hymns so selected were to be used?\n\nA convincing proof that the 1st Mandala is a ceremonial liturgy on eclectic principles, is found in the fact that the centre of the Mandala is occupied by the remarkable single verse to Agni of Ka\u015byapa and the hymn of the Five Rishis. So earnest has been the intention to get these into the centre of the book that they are actually thrust into the midst of the hymns ascribed to Kutsa. No other Rishi\u2019s hymns in this Mandala are disjointed in such a way, and this of itself constitutes a startling anomaly. There are 191 hymns in the 1st Mandala, an exact division of which would give 95 hymns on each side with an odd one in the middle. The 95th hymn, however, happens to be the first hymn of Kutsa addressed to Agni. To insert anything there would be to sever the hymns of Agni, of which there are five. Kutsa\u2019s next hymns after these five are addressed to Indra, and it is between the last hymn to Agni and the first to Indra that the one verse of Ka\u015byapa and the hymn of the Five Rishis are introduced. It thus happens that there are 99 hymns before, and 90 hymns after, this medial couple. Such a medial\nposition for two exceptional hymns cannot have resulted from accident.\n\nIt may instantly occur to a critic that a more nearly medial position would have been secured by placing these two hymns just before those of Kutsa to Agni, thus having 94 hymns before and 96 hymns after them. But if the centre of the Mandala represents the supreme moment in the ceremonial when the Soma was poured out, there was special reason for placing the hymns to Agni on one side, and those to Indra on the other side of that solemn act; for Agni and Indra are said to share the Soma libation between them. That the verse of Ka\u015byapa and the hymn of the Five Rishis marks the place in the ceremonial at which the Soma was offered, is conclusively shown by the following argument: Ka\u015byapa and his family were pre-eminently the Rishis of the Soma. The Aitareya-Brahmana distinctly tells us (vii. 27): \u0924\u092e\u094d\u092d\u094b \u092d\u0942\u0924\u0935\u093f\u0930\u093f\u0937\u094b\u093d\u0938\u093f\u0924\u092e\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0917\u093e \u0915\u093e\u0936\u094d\u092f\u092a\u0903 \u0938\u094b\u092e\u092a\u0940\u0921\u092e\u0928\u093f\u0927\u093f\u0903\u0964 \"For these Bh\u016btaviras, the Asitamriga Ka\u015byapas conquered the Soma-juice.\" In corroboration of this, it may be observed, that all the hymns of the Ka\u015byapas but two are in praise of Soma. The exceptions are, one hymn to Indra placed among the miscellaneous collection of the 8th Mandala, and the hymn, consisting of a single verse to Agni, which we are discussing. Thus Ka\u015byapa was just the Rishi most appropriate to cite at the Soma libation; and what does his single verse to Agni say? Why, just the words we should naturally expect to be uttered at such a moment. The verse runs thus:\u2014\"Let us offer libations to him who knows all our wealth. May Agni consume the wealth of our enemies! May Agni free us from all dangers, and cause us to pass over misfortune, as a ship passes over the sea!\" Here we have a remarkable hymn\u2014the only hymn in the Rig-veda consisting of a single verse\u2014ascribed to the special Rishi of the Soma, invoking the deity who shares half the libation, and proclaiming its very purpose in the words \"Let us offer libations.\" The companion hymn to this short one of Ka\u015byapa renders this still clearer, for it is by the Five Rishis, and\nis dedicated to Indra and the Maruts. Now we know that Indra and the Maruts are sharers of half the oblation with Agni (see hymn 72), and this circumstance renders the position of this hymn both obvious and full of interest. It seems impossible to suggest any other reason for separating Kutsa's hymns to Agni and those to Indra from each other, by the insertion of these invocations to Agni and Indra with the Maruts, in the very centre of the Mandala, than the reason I have offered, that it marks the point in the ceremonial when the libation of Soma was poured out.\n\nThe orderly arrangement of the families of the Rishis around this central point is far too systematic to result from accident, or indeed from any other cause than thoughtful design. The Mandala is arranged as follows:\n\n1. Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra's family. (Hymns 1\u201310.)\n2. Angiras family (Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja branch). (11\u201364.)\u00b9\n3. Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha's family. (65\u201373.)\n4. Angiras family (Gautama branch). (74\u201394.)\n5. Kutsa (Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja Angiras.) (95\u201399.)\nKa\u015byapa\u00b2 and the Five Rishis. (100, 101.)\n5. Kutsa (Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja Angiras). (102\u2013116.)\n4. Angiras family (Gautama branch). (117\u2013127.)\n3. Bh\u1e5bigu's family. (128\u2013140.)\n2. Angiras family (Gautama branch). (141\u2013164.)\n1. Agasti. (165\u2013191.)\n\nAn inspection of this list will show its admirably systematic arrangement. We see that the representative of the Soma occupies the centre just as we saw in the arrangement of the Mandalas themselves; on each side of this centre an Angiras set of hymns of the Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja branch is placed; outside these come hymns of the Gautama branch; outside\n\n\u00b9 Some of the Rishis in this cluster are of doubtful lineage; but they are all certainly Angiras.\n\u00b2 The special connection of Ka\u015byapa with the centre is plainly stated in the Bh\u0101gavata-Pur\u0101\u1e47a (ix. 16, 21, 22), where, speaking of the distribution of space among the Br\u0101hmans, it is said:\u2014\u201cHe gave . . . . to others the intermediate regions; and, to Ka\u015byapa, the central.\u201d\nthese are found hymns of the Va\u015bishthas and Bhrigus balancing each other; beyond these come other Angiras collections; and finally at the extremities we have hymns of the Vai\u015bv\u0101mitras and Agastyas at opposite poles of the Mandala. It will be noticed that, in the first part, there are two sets of Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja and one of Gautama hymns, in the second part this is reversed, for in that there are two sets of Gautama hymns and one of Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja hymns.\n\nAnother striking peculiarity of this Mandala is the fact that towards the end are hymns to Agni. In all other parts of the Rig-veda every hymn to Agni is placed at the beginning; this is also true of the hymns of all the Rishis of the first Mandala, except those of Agasti, which have those celebrating Indra and the Maruts first, while those to Agni come near the end. The effect of this arrangement is that this Mandala has hymns to Agni at both the beginning and the end, a peculiarity which brings to mind the oft-repeated dictum that Agni is the beginning and the end of the sacrifice.\n\nAn important thing to notice is that there are five clusters of hymns on each side of the medial point. This divides the Mandala into eleven parts, and at once explains the meaning of the phrase that the Puro\u1e37\u0101sa was offered in eleven vessels. It suggests the inference that the Puro\u1e37\u0101sa was a religious act which commemorated all the Rishis, and with them the entire people, in a ceremonial observance, consisting of eleven separate acts accompanied by the recitation of eleven sets of hymns, as arranged in the first Mandala.\n\nThe hymn of the Five Rishis is one of peculiar significance, but need not detain us in this preliminary explana-\n\n---\n\n1 The 6th Mandala, however, has one hymn to Agni at the end.\n2 These Five Rishis are said to have been r\u0101jarshis, or royal sages, and there is something in their relationships, and even in their names, to identify them with the five P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava princes. It is noticeable that one of them, Ambarisha, is reputed to have been the progenitor of \u015aunahshepha, whose hymns are conspicuous in this Mandala. On the other hand, it must be stated that they are called V\u0101rshagiras, or descendants of Vrishagir, who is supposed to have been an ancient king. I prefer to translate the word as \"descendants of the adorers of the sprinkler,\" that is, worshippers of Indra, a title singularly appropriate to the\ntion of the main principles regulating the arrangement of the hymns of the Rig-veda. I hope I have offered enough to show that the Mandalas are arranged upon intelligent principles, that the 10th Mandala consists of two distinct parts, and that the 1st Mandala is a ceremonial liturgy.\\(^1\\) I now proceed to explain the arrangement of the individual hymns in each Mandala.\n\nThere are three circumstances which guided the arrangement of the hymns in all the Mandalas; the first of these is the deity addressed, the second is the length of the hymn, and the third is its metre. The primary arrangement of the hymns of the first seven Mandalas is according to the deities celebrated. The gods follow each other in a fairly defined order. Hymns to Agni invariably come first, and those addressed to Indra are placed second. These two are the *dii majores*. In the first seven Mandalas, out of a total of 618 hymns, 333 are in praise of either Agni or Indra, leaving only 285 hymns to celebrate all the other gods of the Pantheon. After the hymns to Indra are placed those addressed to the Vi\u015bvadevas, and the Maruts or companions of Indra. Then come hymns connected with the Sun, under the names of Mitra, S\u016brya, Savitri, \u0100dityas, A\u015bwins, etc.; followed by those celebrating meteoric phenomena, as storms, rain, wind (Rudra, Varuna, V\u0101yu), etc.; and lastly come those addressed to the heavens and the earth, and such-like material objects.\n\nThe hymns occurring under each deity are arranged in the order of their diminishing length, the longest hymn always coming first, and the shortest hymn last. A mere cursory inspection will show that wherever the regularity of authors of a hymn to Indra and the Maruts. It is curious that the hymn itself speaks of the \"five classes of beings,\" as though this hymn were intended to express the adoration of all sections of the Brahmanic community.\n\n\\(^1\\) It certainly deserves notice that no hymn of Atri, or of his family, finds a place in the 1st Mandala. He is the only Maharshi excluded. This may arise from the fact already mentioned that he represents the Soma, and the place he would therefore have occupied is filled by K\u0101ty\u0101ya\u1e47a. Atri appears to have been devoted to Lunar interests, and preserved no hymn to Agni, although some of his family did, and this partizanship may have operated to exclude his family from the eclectic Mandala, every Rishi in which celebrates the god Agni.\nthese clusters of hymns of diminishing length has not been strictly preserved, it is invariably caused by the presence of one or two hymns of greater length at the end of the series to which they belong. This circumstance alone is sufficient to prove that these longer hymns were placed at the end of their respective series for some special reason. And that reason is found to be a change of metre. The following tables will show the regular arrangement of the hymns according to deity and diminishing length; the places where this order is disturbed at the ends by change of metre is indicated by a short rule or dash. These tables contain the hymns of the Sanhita in the order of their occurrence, giving the number of verses which each hymn contains. The arrangement into clusters of diminishing length serves to show the deities which were intimately associated with each other in the minds of the ancient Br\u0101hmans, and the relative importance of each deity.\n\n2nd Mandala.\n\nDeity celebrated.

An examination of the hymns themselves will show that these deviations are caused by a change of metre, the practice being to place hymns of mixed metre after those written in one and the same metre. It will be found that hymns addressed to a single deity and written in one metre have precedence over hymns addressed to several deities or written in mixed metres. It would extend this paper to extravagant length to substantiate this assertion; because it could be done only by a detailed examination of each unconformable hymn. It may be accepted, however, as a simple fact that all these apparent deviations from the theoretical order are readily explainable in the manner indicated.\n\nThere are, however, two notable exceptions to the law I have laid down. It will be seen that the twelfth hymn of the 4th Mandala contains six verses, while the hymn before it has only five verses. This is, in reality, the only hymn in the Rig-veda which puzzles me; and I am driven to the unsatisfactory suggestion that either this hymn contains a spurious verse, or the hymn before it has accidentally lost a verse. It is, however, consoling to my theory to know\nthat it is not driven to invent all sorts of excuses to explain all sorts of anomalies; on the other hand, of the 1017 hymns the Rig-veda contains, there is only this solitary verse which stubbornly defies the principles of arrangement I have laid down.\n\nThe other instance to which I have alluded is anomalous only in appearance. The hymns to Savitri, etc., at the end of the 2nd Mandala, are arranged according to the following lengths\u201411, 8, 6, 21, 3, 3, where we find a hymn of 21 verses thrust between hymns of 6 and 3 verses respectively. An inspection of this hymn, however, confirms rather than militates against my law; for the hymn in question will be found to be divisible into seven portions of three verses each. There is nothing fanciful in this suggested subdivision of the hymn, for the sections are clearly marked by the varying deities to which each part is addressed, and these deities are not obscurely alluded to, but are distinctly named, and clearly cut the hymn into seven well-defined portions. The following list shows the construction of the hymn\u2014\n\nVerses 1 to 3 celebrate V\u0101yu.\n\u201e 4 \u201e 6 \u201e Mitra and Varuna.\n\u201e 7 \u201e 9 \u201e A\u015bwins.\n\u201e 10 \u201e 12 \u201e Indra.\n\u201e 13 \u201e 15 \u201e Vi\u015bvadevas.\n\u201e 16 \u201e 18 \u201e Sarasvat\u012b.\n\u201e 19 \u201e 21 \u201e Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe last hymn of the 3rd Mandala, also, readily admits of resolution into parts of three verses each. It consists of 18 verses divisible into six portions, thus\u2014\n\nVerses 1 to 3 celebrate Indra and Varuna.\n\u201e 4 \u201e 6 \u201e Vrihaspati.\n\u201e 7 \u201e 9 \u201e P\u016bshan.\n\u201e 10 \u201e 12 \u201e Savitri.\n\u201e 13 \u201e 15 \u201e Soma.\n\u201e 16 \u201e 18 \u201e Mitra and Varuna\nBoth these hymns are placed just where clusters of three verses ought to be, according to the rule of diminishing length.\n\nThe miscellaneous nature of the 8th Mandala does not allow the system of arrangement to appear conspicuously; but wherever two or more hymns are addressed to one deity, they are found to conform to the general law. Thus Medhy\u0101tithi contributed two hymns to Indra, the one of 48 verses being placed before the other of 24 verses; Goshukti's two hymns to Indra occur in the order 15 and 13 verses; Virupa's two hymns to Agni follow each other as 33, 30; and Kurusuti's three hymns to Indra are placed in the order 12, 11, 10. There can, obviously, be no principle of arrangement exhibited in the numerous single hymns of Rishis, of which this Mandala chiefly consists.\n\nThe 9th Mandala, however, boldly proclaims the influence of metre and length on the arrangement of the hymns. The following table shows the construction of this Mandala.\n\n(a.) G\u0101yatr\u012b\u201410, 10, 10, 10, 11, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4.\n\nG\u0101yatr\u012b with other metres\u201430, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 32.\n\n(b.) Jagat\u012b\u201410, 10, 10, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5.\n\nJagat\u012b with other metres\u201412, 48.\n\n(c.) Tri\u1e63\u1e6dubh\u20149, 8, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 5.\n\nTri\u1e63\u1e6dubh with other metres\u201424, 58.\n\n(d.) Anu\u1e63\u1e6dubh\u201412, 8, 9.\n\nAnu\u1e63\u1e6dubh with other metres\u201416.\n\n(e.) U\u1e63\u1e47ih\u20148, 6, 6.\n\nU\u1e63\u1e47ih with other metres\u201414.\n\n(f.) Subordinate, and mixed metres\u201426, 16, 22, 12, 3, 4, 11, 4.\n\nTotal, 114 hymns.\nThe foregoing clusters of hymns are themselves arranged in the order of their diminishing length; for there are 67 G\u0101yatr\u012b hymns, 19 Jagat\u012b hymns, 11 Trishtubh hymns, 4 Anush\u1e6dubh hymns, 4 U\u1e63\u1e47ih, and only one or two specimens each of the subordinate metres.\n\nThere is one apparent anomaly in this Mandala which is actually a proof that the hymns have been heedfully arranged. The Mandala, it will be seen, begins with four hymns of ten verses each, and then comes one hymn of eleven verses. Why is not the longer hymn first in this case also? The hymn of eleven verses is positively the \u0100pri hymn of the Mandala, addressed to Soma as P\u0101vam\u0101na, and it is the hymn whence the whole Mandala derives its title of P\u0101vam\u0101ni. These facts render it still more extraordinary that four shorter hymns should take precedence of it. The reason for the anomaly is to be found in the names of the Rishis of these four hymns. The first is by Madhucchhandas; the second by Medh\u0101tithi; the third is by \u015aunah\u015bepa; and the fourth is by Hira\u1e47ya\u015batupa. These Vai\u015bv\u0101mitra and Angiras poets were placed before the K\u0101\u015byapa Rishis on account of their special sanctity; in confirmation of which I would point out that the hymns of these four Rishis are placed at the very beginning of the 1st Mandala, and in the very same order in which they occur here. Thus we have clear proof of design both in the selection of the Rishis, and in the order in which they are placed.\n\nThe first 84 hymns of the 10th Mandala follow the system of the other Mandalas, beginning with hymns to Agni, followed by others to Indra, and others to the Vi\u015bvadevas. It is, however, evidently a congeries of small collections, for this is repeated two or three times, mixed with other hymns, in the course of these 84 hymns. Additional investigation is required in order to separate these various clusters; but I have not thought that needful in this preliminary essay. As in the case of the 8th Mandala, the small number of hymns ascribed to each Rishi renders it difficult to trace the method of arrangement; but wherever two or three hymns by the same Rishi do occur, the ordinary system is at once\napparent. Thus the seven hymns ascribed to Vim\u0101da are arranged as follows:\n\nAgni\u201410, 8.\nIndra\u201415, 7, 6.\nSoma\u201411.\nP\u016bshan\u20149.\n\nThis is in strict conformity with the usual system, both as regards the order in which the deities are celebrated, and the arrangement of the hymns celebrating them, according to their length.\n\nAfter the 84th hymn of this Mandala, everything is plain; for the method of arrangement according to diminishing length has been apparent even to casual inspection. It has been observed and acknowledged as indisputable for many years; and, therefore, I need not present a tabular statement of what is already well known.\n\nIt is the intention of this paper merely to demonstrate that the hymns of the Rig-veda are arranged on a definite system, and to point out the main features of that system. I venture to think that the evidences here presented are conclusive of the point. None, I think, will contend that the orderly arrangement which I have shown to exist in these venerable poems is the result of accident. The discovery that the 1st Mandala is a ceremonial liturgy, and that all the hymns have a definite place in the canon, can hardly fail to give a fresh impulse to the investigations of scholars, and to lead to many unexpected discoveries. In the hope that such may indeed be the case, I lay this paper before my fellow-students.\nJOURNAL\n\nOF\n\nTHE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY.\n\nART. XIX.\u2014\u015a\u016bka-sande\u015ba\u1e25. A Sanskrit Poem by Lakshmi-d\u0101sa. With Preface and Notes in English, by H.H. R\u0101ma-Varma, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Travancore, G.C.S.I., M.R.A.S., and a Commentary by Keral\u0101-varma.\n\nPreface.\n\nThe ancient Sanskrit literature of India is attracting daily the increasing attention of Orientalists of Europe. Sanskrit works, hitherto unknown, are being brought to the notice of the public by the labours of European scholars like Doctors B\u00fchler, Cowell, Burnell, and others. Those labours, however, have been but very imperfectly extended to the purely Sanskrit literature of Kerala or Malayalam in the South-Western extremity of India. In the blessed isolation which that Land of Para\u015bu-r\u0101ma had for ages enjoyed, the cultivation of Sanskrit literature was far from being neglected. Poets have flourished who would yield superiority to none in the rest of India, except perhaps to the great K\u0101lid\u0101sa and one or two others of the highest rank. It cannot, therefore, be labour wasted to bring some of the works left by them to the notice of European Orientalists. The manuscript here printed for the first time is a poem called \u201c\u015auka-sande\u015ba,\u201d or \u201c\u015auka-d\u016bta\u201d\u2014\u201cParrot-messenger.\u201d It is very much on the plan of K\u0101lid\u0101sa\u2019s celebrated \u201cMegha-d\u016bta,\u201d so admirably translated into English verse by the late Professor Horace Hayman Wilson. The metre is the same\u2014Mand\u0101kr\u0101nt\u0101.\nThe poet Lakshmi-d\u0101sa dreams himself to be suddenly transported to R\u0101me\u015bvaram, or R\u0101ma-setu, the well-known place of pilgrimage, off the southern end of the Coromandel coast. There he meets a parrot of supernatural intelligence and powers, and conveys the message by him to his wife at Gun\u0101-puram.\n\nFollowing the plan of the Megha-d\u016bta, the author describes the towns, shrines, mountains, rivers, and all chief objects of interest in the route the parrot is asked to take from R\u0101me\u015bvaram to Gun\u0101-puram. Some of the places alluded to by the poet are well known and easily identified. In regard to others, all that can be done is to hazard guesses. The notes in English appended to the poem are attempts to throw on such allusions as much light as is available.\n\nThe age of the poet or of the poem I have not been able to find out. But for the very reason that several of the places are now difficult to be identified, and the political formations described in the poem are not what are now found, the poem must be some three or four centuries old. At the same time the poet\u2019s allusion to Ko\u1e37ambam, alias Kollam, alias Quilon, which gives the current era of the Malab\u0101r coast, places the poem posterior to the construction of that town and the synchronous commencement of the era. The Ko\u1e37ambam or Kollam era dates from the 25th August, 825 A.D., and hence the date of the poem must be somewhere between the 9th and 16th centuries\u2014probably nearer to the latter than to the former.\n\nAs already observed, the \u201c\u015auka-sande\u015ba\u201d is in strict imitation of K\u0101lid\u0101sa\u2019s \u201cMegha-d\u016bta.\u201d It is a much more laboured production, and possesses very considerable poetical merit, although the effortless wellings of a poetical genius and the delicately graphic delineations of inward and outward nature by an intuitively close observer of it, must ever render the King of Indian poets\u2014K\u0101lid\u0101sa\u2014inimitable.\n\nThere are other \u201cSande\u015bas\u201d or \u201cMessages\u201d besides this\n\n---\n\n1 See note 20.\nThe Travancore Palace Library contains the following:\n\n1. Subhaga-sande\u015ba.\n2. Bhramara-sande\u015ba.\n3. Ch\u0101taka-sande\u015ba.\n4. H\u0101r\u1e63a-sande\u015ba.\n5. Another H\u0101r\u1e63a-sande\u015ba.\n\nThe first three of the above are by poets of Keralam, and the last two by others. All are in the Mand\u0101kr\u0101nt\u0101 metre. Further particulars on these will be found in Appendix A.\n\nThe poem of \"\u015auka-sande\u015ba\" has more than one commentary. But finding them either too prolix or too meagre, I had requested Kera\u1e37a-varm\u0101 Koil Tampur\u0101m, the consort of my niece, the Mah\u0101r\u0101\u1e47i of Travancore, to write a new one. This commentary is inserted in the manuscript, and selections from it are given at the end of this article. Appendix A, also, I owe to him. While his attainments in Sanskrit literature are of a very high order, he has acquired by self-education a very creditable knowledge of English, and possesses great natural talents.\n\nI hope fully that the Sanskrit literature of Keralam, hitherto almost entirely unknown to European Orientalists, will receive the attention which it deserves. In this direction it will always be a pleasure to me to render such aid as I may be qualified to do.\nText.\n\n\u092c\u0930\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093e \u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947

Guna-puram.\u2014No town or village at present bears that name. But it may be remembered that Pr\u0101k\u1e5bita or vernacular names are always Sanskritized when introduced into a purely Sanskrit composition. In doing so, no strict adherence to the construction or import of the original is obligatory. This alone would make identification difficult after the lapse of some centuries, not to speak of other causes of mystification. All that can be done is to depend upon tradition or to make one's own guess. I have not been able to gather anything from tradition on this point, and my best guess is as follows:\u2014The penultimate stage described by the poet is \u015ari Kurumba, which, I am convinced, is Ko\u1e0du\u1e45gall\u016br or Cranganore on the sea-coast, where there is a celebrated Devi or Durg\u0101 temple. Hence Guna-puram cannot be far from it. Now, I am credibly informed that there is a village called Trikkanapuram, a little to the north of Ko\u1e0du\u1e45gall\u016br. In all probability this is the poet's Guna-puram. The supposition is supported phonetically and geographically.\n\n2. It is well known that \u015aa\u1e45kha, or the conch shell, is bored in the apex and blown as a trumpet by Hindus. The Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata makes frequent allusion to the shells used by the great warriors of that epic. Nowadays its use is a more peaceful and humble one. It forms a part of the musical band of every temple in Kerala. The verse alludes to the spontaneous sounding of these shells in the sea. There is a\nbelief that sometimes in the silence and calm of midnight\nthe sound of the conch shell could be heard in the sea off\nTrivandram\u2014the particular point on the coast being called\n\u015aa\u1e45kham Mukham.\n\n3. Jyotirlingam in this stanza is the Li\u1e45ga of \u015aiva, con-\nsecrated by R\u0101ma at R\u0101me\u015bvaram on his way back from\nLa\u1e45k\u0101 after killing R\u0101vana in battle and regaining S\u012bt\u0101.\nThe word Jyotirlingam, or Li\u1e45ga of light, is said to occur\nin the Sthala-m\u0101h\u0101tmya of that temple.\n\n4. This Setu-rekh\u0101 is the rocky formation well known as\nAdam\u2019s bridge.\n\n5. This allusion to pearls in the T\u0101mr\u0101 or T\u0101mra-par\u1e47i\nwould show that pearl fishery near the mouths of that river\nexisted in the days of the poem. Tuticurin still occupies a\nprominent place in that respect.\n\n6. The city of Ma\u1e47al\u016bra, on the banks of the T\u0101mra-par\u1e47i\nin P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dya-de\u015ba, was of great note in ancient days. The\nname occurs in Bh\u0101gavata-pur\u0101\u1e47a in connection with Bala-\nr\u0101ma\u2019s pilgrimage. It occurs in Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata in connec-\ntion with Arjuna\u2019s pilgrimage. Arjuna married the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dya\nR\u0101j\u0101\u2019s daughter on this occasion. By that marriage he\nhad a son called Babhru-v\u0101hana. Arjuna, when he sub-\nsequently went thither with the sacrificial horse intended\nfor his brother R\u0101j\u0101 Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira\u2019s A\u015bvamedha Yaj\u00f1a,\nhad an encounter with his son and was vanquished. The\nmodern Br\u0101hma\u1e47 village of Ma\u1e47alkarai on the bank of the\nT\u0101mra-par\u1e47i stands on the site of this capital of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dya\nkingdom.\n\n7. The poet advises his parrot to avoid the right-hand\nroute, which, though shorter, is risky, as it is infested by\nPulindas, who ensnare and kill birds and beasts, and to take\nthe left-hand one. To one facing N.W. from Tinnevelly,\nthis right-hand route would lie through the Western portion\nof the Madura District and cross some point in the Gh\u0101\u1e6ds\nnear the present G\u016b\u1e0dal\u016br pass. Who these Pulindas were,\nwhether any living races represent them, whether at the\nperiod of the poem they predominated over civilized races\nin this part of Southern India, are interesting questions.\n8. The Western Gh\u0101\u1e6ds are in Sanskrit called the Sahya. Sometimes Malaya and Sahya are indiscriminately used. It is not clear which portions of the long range running parallel to the western coast come under these different designations. But surely the southern portion is Sahya.\n\n9. Here the cascade indicated by the word \u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0947\u0936\u0915 is not quite easy to identify. The two well-known series of waterfalls in the southern portion of the Gh\u0101\u1e6ds are, (1) those formed by the little stream Gha\u1e6dan\u0101, near Kutt\u0101lam; and (2) those by the T\u0101mraparn\u012b, called P\u0101mpan, B\u0101nat\u012brtham, and P\u0101pan\u0101\u015bam. But either of these would be far to the north of the route described to the parrot, who is to take Cape Comorin en route. There is also another reason to suspect that the above two series of falls are not meant. The poet's words, \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u093e\u0924\u094d \u092a\u093e\u0921\u093c\u093e\u0935\u0927\u093f\u092a\u093f\u092a\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e, should be taken into account. The commentator considers \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u093e\u0924\u094d indicates merely a change of place. But my own surmise is that it means \"the other side,\" which, in this case, is also West. Now, \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u093e\u0924\u094d, which comes from the same source as \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u093e\u0924\u094d, means Western. Hence I think the poet refers to some fall on the western slopes of the mountains. There is a fall, though very small, called Olakka Arici (Peatle fall), in the A\u015bambhu sub-range, not far from Cape Comorin. Poetical imagination has of course the licence of magnifying the tiniest of things.\n\n10. These \u015aabaras are the Mongolian mountain races who are found all along the range of the Gh\u0101\u1e6ds, having a particular name at each place, such as Todas, Badagas, Irulas, Mannans, Vedas, Kanis, etc. V\u0101lmiki, alludes, in his R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, to a \u015aabari, who entertained R\u0101ma with her fruit and root fare, in his peregrinations in these parts in search of the lost S\u012bt\u0101. The women of these mountains wear necklaces of the seeds of \u0917\u0941\u091c\u0930\u093e (Adinantha Paronia) as described here.\n\n11. The word \u0935\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930 in this stanza throws a flood of light on the subjects of land tenures, the proprietary rights, relative positions of Jannies and tenants, sovereign rights of temple corporations, etc., which now occupy the serious attention of statesmen, judges, arbitrators, antiquaries, etc., in\nKerala, including Travancore. Whatever may be the causes and facts of the original Aryan colonization of Kerala, it is certain that the Br\u0101hmans, the priestly class, became the lords of the land. All temple property aggregations were created by them, and all kings and chiefs originally appointed by them. It would be absurd to maintain that temple aggregations are endowments by kings, or that the Br\u0101hman lords were originally only revenue collectors like the Zam\u012bnd\u0101rs of Bengal. Such theories, however, are held by many well-intentioned Englishmen. The author of the poem is a disinterested witness standing at the distance of several centuries back.\n\n12. The legend that J\u0101madagnya or Para\u015bu-r\u0101ma raised Kerala, extending from Gokarna to Kum\u0101ri or Cape Comorin, from the bosom of the Indian Ocean, by the throw of his battle-axe, and colonized it with Br\u0101hmans, is too well known to be detailed here.\n\n13. The reference here is to the well-known Devi or Durg\u0101 temple situated at Cape Comorin.\n\n14. The hill called in this verse is a bold granite formation abruptly rising to some 2000 feet from the sea-level and isolated from the spurs of the Gh\u0101ts. It is ordinarily called Marutv\u0101n Malai or Indra Hill. It is situated some five miles N.N.W. of Cape Comorin and as many miles S.S.E. of \u015auchindram, described in the next verse. It is supposed, as the poet avers, to be the favourite abode of Yogis and Siddhas for their absorbing contemplation of the Divine Soul in the solitudes of its caverns and breezy ledges. There are two small rock temples\u2014one near the foot and the other a little higher up. The ascent is difficult and precipitous; but people do go to the very summit. The hill is illuminated on the night of the full moon in the month of K\u0101rttika.\n\nThere are two legends about the hill. One is that Indra and his elephant Air\u0101vata were petrified here by a certain curse, but were, by virtue of penances undergone in the \u015auchindram temple, liberated. The hill represents their petrification. The other is, that it is a bit that dropped\nfrom Oshadhi-\u015baila with which Hanumat was speeding on to revive Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a, who lay pierced by R\u0101vana\u2019s spear. The hill is therefore supposed to contain medicinal herbs of rare virtues. The hill, with its rounded and lichen-encrusted rock-sides and domes, and its slightly bent configuration, not unlike the tower of Pisa, has, particularly when the morning or evening sun beats on it, a most venerable appearance. Indeed it is so much so that I had often thought Vriddha-\u015bravas a more appropriate name for it than Marutvat, though the strong winds which blow from all sides in its vicinity make the latter name not less fitted.\n\n15. \u0917\u0943\u0939 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0924, in this, refers to the boiling butter ordeal which was in vogue till some forty years ago in the great \u015aiva temple of Suchindram, which the parrot is directed to visit. Chastity is most strictly enjoined among women of the Namb\u016bri Br\u0101hmans. The adulterer, if he himself is a Namb\u016bri Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, is likewise excommunicated and outcasted. A pseudo-judicial inquiry is held by the recognized religious headmen on receiving charges of adultery. When direct proofs are obtained, the culprits are convicted at once; but when direct proofs are not available, and yet morally suspicious circumstances exist, the accused man has recourse to the Ghee ordeal to prove his innocence. This ordeal must be performed in the Suchindram temple. Ghee is boiled in a small vessel, and a small silver image of the sacred bull is thrown into it. The accused picks this up. His hand is immediately wrapped with plantain leaves, and he is lodged in a place for three days, at the end of which, if his hand be found unscathed on removing the leaves, he is declared innocent, if burnt, guilty.\n\nAlong with Sati, Nariya sacrifice and other cruel practices, this barbarous custom, founded though it was on Manu\u2019s dictum, was happily swept away by the humane influence of the British Government.\n\n16. Va\u1e6div\u012b\u015bvaram is in every probability the Agrah\u0101ra referred to. It is the most flourishing of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a villages in South Travancore. Even now there are there several Br\u0101hma\u1e47as who perform their daily Agni-hotra.\n17. Sy\u0101nand\u016bra-puram is the name given here to Triv\u0101ndram or, more properly, Tiru-ananta-puram. It is, according to the local Pur\u0101\u1e47a, said to have had four different names in the four Yugas. Sy\u0101nand\u016bra-puram in Krita, \u0100nanda-puram in Treta, Ananta-puram in Dv\u0101para, and Padman\u0101bham in Kali.

Ananta-puram, the prefix Tiru being equivalent to the proposition \u015ar\u012b (\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940) usually placed before Hindu names.\n\n18. Several Tirthas, or holy bathing-places, exist in Triv\u0101ndram, such as, Sa\u1e45kha, Padma, P\u0101da, Var\u0101ha, N\u0101ga, \u0100gastya, Pit\u1e5bi, \u015aakra, Chakra, Dharm\u0101dharma, etc. But many described in the Pur\u0101\u1e47a cannot now be identified.\n\n19. The kingdom of K\u016bpaka (\u0915\u0942\u092a\u0915) was, in ordinary parlance, called K\u0101yankulam. It was conquered and annexed by the king of Travancore in the middle of the eighteenth century. A place called Ka\u1e6d\u1e6dola is said to have been the capital of that kingdom. That kingdom went also by the name of Jayatunghan\u0101\u1e0d. Quilon came within it.\n\n20. Kolamba is the modern Kollam or (Anglicized) Quilon. In the old annals of the Roman Catholic missions on the Malabar coast we meet with such phrases as \u201cBishop of Kolamba.\u201d The place gives the current era of the whole Malabar coast. The Kollam era commenced in 825 A.D. In the southern half of Malabar the year begins on the 15th August, and in the northern on the 15th September. As in most matters the truth lies between extremes, and antiquaries have found out that the true date of the era is the 26th of August.\n\n21. In a land so much intersected by natural rivulets and artificial navigation channels, it is difficult to identify the\ntwo rivers (\u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0938) here mentioned. It may, in all probability, have reference to the rivers of Kallada and Ittikara, or two branches of one or the other.\n\n22. Vallabha Gr\u0101ma (\u0935\u0932\u094d\u0932\u092d\u0917\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092e) is the modern Tiruvall\u0101, some thirty miles N.N.E. of Quilon. There is a large Vishnu temple here, and a large settlement of Malayali Br\u0101hmans. The Deity here is adored at different parts of the day as Brahmac\u0101rt, Grihastha, V\u0101naprastha and Sanny\u0101si.\n\n23. \u092c\u093f\u0902\u092c\u0932\u0940 (Bimbali) refers to the two kingdoms of Tekkank\u016br and Vatakkan\u0101kk\u016br (\u0935\u091f\u0915\u0915\u0928\u093e\u0915\u0941\u0930\u094d and \u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923\u0915\u0928\u093e\u0915\u0941\u0930\u094d), also conquered and incorporated with modern Travancore in the eighteenth century. The descendants of those chiefs are pensioners of the Travancore Government. Cottayam (Ko\u1e6d\u1e6dayam), the well-known head-quarters of the Church of England Mission in Travancore, is within three kingdoms. The large lagoon to the west of Ko\u1e6d\u1e6dayam is called Vemban\u0101\u1e6d lake, and Vemban\u0101\u1e6d is a corruption of Bimbalin\u0101\u1e6d.\n\n24. \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0938. This word would naturally point to some island in the rivers and estuaries. I would have put it down for the modern islet of P\u0101tir\u0101-Manappuram in the Vemban\u0101\u1e6d lake. But a learned friend suggests either a place called Chitrakka\u1e6davu near Chang\u0101na\u015beri or Ta\u1e37i-kot\u1e6da near Ko\u1e6d\u1e6dayam, though neither is an island. It is puzzling what the poet means by making this place surrounded or fortified by large elephants.\n\n25. The river \u0917\u0902\u0917\u093e is one of the branches of the M\u016bvallupura\u00b9 river. It is locally called P\u0101r\u016br river. It was on the banks of this river that the great Hindu reformer Sa\u1e45kara-\u0100ch\u0101rya was born. The Vishnu temple described here is that at Trippunittura, the modern capital of Cochin State.\n\n26. Here, the learned Br\u0101hman referred to by the name \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0947\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930, belonged to the house of Puliyann\u016br Namp\u016bripp\u0101\u1e6d, a Br\u0101hman lord of the village Ve\u00f1jan\u0101\u1e6d. There is also a Subrahmanya\u2019s or K\u0101rttikeya\u2019s temple near the house, to explain the double meaning of the verse. The members\n\n\u00b9 pronounced as in thirst, first, etc.\nof this house are still the chief T\u00e2ntrika priests in several temples of note.\n\n27 and 28. \u091a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093f is the northern branch of Periy\u00e2r or \u00c2lv\u00e2y river. The temple alluded to is Tiru-Va\u00f1chi-kulam, dedicated to \u015aiva. It is a place of great note, and is one of the 108 holy \u015aiva-Sthalas sacred to \u015aivites of Southern India.\n\n\u092e\u0939\u094b\u0926\u092f\u092a\u0941\u0930\u092e\u094d (Mahodaya-puram) was the ancient capital of the Perum\u00e2ls, of whom Cher\u00e2m Perum\u00e2l was the most celebrated. The city was built by Mahodaya Perum\u00e2l. It is no longer a place of any importance, and even in the poet\u2019s time must have long past its meridian.\n\n29. This refers to the legend of the coronation of Cher\u00e2m Perum\u00e2l and others among his predecessors and successors by the representatives of the 64 Br\u00e2hman village corporations which Para\u015bur\u00e2ma created. Some of these men were authorized to bear arms, and were consequently deprived of the privilege of studying the Vedas.\n\n30. \u091a\u0902\u0921\u093f\u0915\u093e is only a synonym for Tiru-Va\u00f1chi-kulam, the \u015aaiva temple alluded to in Note 27. The Sanskrit name of Travancore is Va\u00f1chi. How that name comes to be the root of the name of a celebrated \u015aaiva temple so near the acknowledged capital of Cher\u00e2m Perum\u00e2l is a suggestive question for antiquaries to solve.\n\n31. The Dev\u00ee or Chand\u00eek\u00e2 here referred to is of \u0915\u094b\u0924\u0941\u0902\u0917\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0942\u0930 or Ko\u1e6dungall\u00fbr or (Anglice) Cranganore. In the very next verse the parrot is directed to Gun\u00e2-puram, the poet\u2019s home, and the subject of Note 1.\n\n32. The allusion in this verse to rainbows produced by the refraction of gems would point to the poet\u2019s powers of observation of Nature.\nVerse 1.

The other four have no commentaries at all. The number of \u015blokas in both the \"Ha\u1e47\u1e0da-sandesas\" is the same, viz. 110. \"Subhaga-sandesa\" contains 130. All of these (the philosophic \"Ha\u1e47\u1e0da\" excepted) are divided into two parts, viz. the P\u016brva and Uttara-sandesas. The metre in all these is m\u0101l\u0101k\u0101\u015ba, invariably adopted by writers of Sandesas. \u0101tak\u1e63a\u1e47i, fourth in the order, is a novelty in this class of poems. A poor Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, probably a Namb\u016bri, that lived in some northern part of Malabar, like many others, flew for refuge to Trivandram, at that troublous time when Tippu invaded Malabar. He (the Namb\u016bri) had an interview with the then reigning Mah\u0101r\u0101ja R\u0101ma Varm\u0101, but he was obliged to leave Trivandram and go home without taking leave of the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, on account of sudden illness. After recovery, he seems to have submitted this poem to the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja praying for patronage. It consists of 141 \u015blokas, of which the first and last are given below.\n\nThis text is not in English and appears to be a Sanskrit text with a translation provided in English.\nand loyalty, and, lastly, natural history. But on another occasion he warns his disciples against the songs of Ch'\u00eang (the 7th book of the 1st part) as licentious.\\(^1\\) He told his son that he would not be worth talking to, if he did not know the Odes.\\(^2\\) Mencius, although he does not urge his disciples to study these poems, frequently quotes them with respect.\n\nWith these examples before them, can we wonder that the Chinese, who have an exaggerated reverence for everything that bears the stamp of antiquity, should still continue to find in the Book all that is needed to teach the two fundamental attributes of Oriental perfection, viz. \u79ae Li Propriety, and \u5112 Yi Righteousness?\n\nThere are several translations of the Book of the Odes into European languages. La Charme and Zottoli have each given a prose version in Latin, both showing a great respect for the views of the Chinese commentators. Callery calls the former, \"La production la plus indigeste et la plus ennuyeuse, dont la sinologie ait \u00e0 rougir.\" Rather a harsh judgment in my opinion, but La Charme's version is not to be compared to Zottoli's, which is an extremely useful work. In German there are the metrical translations by Friedrich R\u00fcckert and Victor von Strauss, while in English we have two translations by Dr. Legge, one in prose and the other in verse. We and all students of Chinese must not fail to express our deep and heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Legge for the years of labour which he has spent over the colossal task of translating the greater number of the Chinese classics. Each of us may humbly venture at times to differ as to the rendering of a certain passage, but which of us may dare to compare our labours or our knowledge of Chinese language and literature with his? No matter what further discoveries may be made, Dr. Legge's translations will ever retain their value, for in them we have the Chinese views and opinions of their own classics brought clearly before us, thanks to the\n\n\\(^1\\) \u912d\u8072\u6deb.

Allen, Esq., M.R.A.S.\n\nThe She King,\u00b9 usually translated the Book of the Odes, or the Classic of Poetry, is not so well known to the outside world as it deserves to be. It is one of the Classics or Canons of Chinese learning, and, like its companion books, is supposed not only to contain deep lessons of morality for the instruction of future ages, but to have been compiled, if not written, for the express purpose of their inculcation.\u00b2 The events recorded or alluded to in it are said to have taken place between 1765 and 585 B.C. Confucius himself is acknowledged to have been the compiler. Ssu Ma ch'ien\u00b3 states: \"The old poems amounted to more than 8000. Confucius removed those which were only repetitions of others, and selected those which would be serviceable for the inculcation of propriety and righteousness.\" In other words he brought out a revised and expurgated edition. Constant allusions to the Odes are found in the Confucian Analects, the Master on all occasions expressing the highest admiration for the work, and enjoining on his disciples the necessity of a thorough study of it. The Odes, he says, stimulate the mind,\u2074 teach introspection, sociability, righteous indignation, filial piety\n\n\u00b9 I confess a preference for Sir Thomas Wade's system of transliteration, and would fain call the work the Shih Ching; but I am assured that this would convey no meaning to European students of Chinese.\n\u00b2 Quaecunque ex antiquorum temporum monumentis idonea ad revocandum pristinum rerum ordinem videbantur, in sex libros collecta edidit, ut inde reipublicae administranda modum, morum disciplinam, et saniores doctrinam discerent posteri.\u2014Confucii Chi King, La Charma.\n\u00b3 \u53f8\u99ac\u9077 n.c. 163-85.\n\u2074 \u8a69\u53ef\u4ee5\u8208\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u89c0\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7fa4\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6028\uff0c\u9060\u4e4b\u4e8b\u4ea4\uff0c\u9060\u4e4b\u4e8b\u541b\uff0c\u591a\u8b80\u65bc\u9ce5\u7378\u8349\u6728\u4e4b\u540d.\nConf. Analecta, xvii. 9.\nDoctor's scholarly and exhaustive treatment of text and commentary. The metrical version of the She King made by Dr. Legge and his nephews is to my mind not quite so successful as his prose work. It is very unequal. Whenever the translator has allowed himself to shake off the trammels of Chinese prosody, he has produced some very pleasing verses, those in the Scotch dialect being particularly charming, for instance:\n\n\"Says oor gudewife, 'The cock is crawin,'  \nQuoth oor gudeman, 'The day is dawin,'  \n'Get up, gudeman, an' tak a spy:  \nSee gin the mornin star be high,  \nSyne tak a saunter roon' aboot;  \nThere's rowth o' dyukes and geese to shoot.\n\nLat flee and bring them hame to me,  \nAnd sic a dish as ye sall pree.  \nIn comin times as ower the stringes  \nYour noddin' heed in rapture hings,  \nSupreme ower care, nor fasht wi' fears,  \nWe'll baith grow auld in worth and years.\n\nAn' when we meet the friends ye like,  \nI'll gi'e to each some little fyke:  \nThe lasses beads, trocks to their brithers,  \nAn' auld warld fairlies to their mithers,  \nSome nick nack lovin' hands will fin'  \nTo show the love that dwalls within.'\"\n\nAnother beginning:\n\n\"The gudeman 'e awa' for to fecht wi' the stranger,\"\n\nis also well worth reading and remembering.\n\nBut in most of the poems the translator has allowed himself to be hampered and cramped by trying to follow the Chinese prosody, at any rate to the extent of making his English version consist of the same number of stanzas as the Chinese, and by translating verse by verse. I contend that\n\n1 Part i. Book vii. Ode 8.\n2 Part i. Book vi. Ode 2.\nby taking a whole poem, and turning it into English with an utter disregard of the order of the lines, or even of the stanzas, it is easier to give a correct version of the original than by following Dr. Legge's perhaps more painstaking method. This I hope to prove later on.\n\nI know of no other complete metrical version of the She King in English. Various gentlemen have tried their hands at translating one or two odes, Sir John Davis among others. A few translations have appeared in the China Review, some very excellent ones by Mr. Lister of Hongkong, the author of a most interesting and valuable essay on the Odes; and some others by V. W. X., a pseudonym that is an open secret among European residents in China. This gentleman, although a ripe Chinese scholar, has attempted the impossible task of going closer to the original than even Dr. Legge has done, and of translating word by word. Sir John Davis says in reference to the She King, \"In European languages there is a certain connection which allows literalness of rendering to be carried to a great extent, but a verbal translation from the one concerning which we now treat must of necessity degenerate into a horrible jargon, which few persons will undergo the disgust of perusing.\"\u00b9\n\nV. W. X. has proved this most conclusively. Here is one of his translations:\u00b2\n\n\"The flax spreads large\nCreeping down the gorge,\nAs the leaves grow thick,\nThe macaws on wing,\nGrouped in the bush,\nThere sweetly sing.\n\nThe flax spreads large\nCreeping down the gorge\nWhen full in leaf.\nFirst reap, then soften,\nWeave coarse or fine,\nAnd glad weave often.\"\n\n\u00b9 Sir John Davis, \"Poetry of the Chinese.\"\n\u00b2 Part i. Book i. Ode 2.\nI'll beg my teacher\nTo let me home.\nFirst wash my common,\nAnd clean my best,\nWhich clean, which not,\nThen to parents blest.\"\n\nThis the translator calls one of the more harmonious odes. He explains the roughness of it by saying that a literal translation has been attempted in all possible cases. \"It should also,\" he observes, \"be borne in mind, that you cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.\"\n\nHere V. W. X. and I are at variance. I believe, and would fain show, that the She King is not a sow's ear, but a mass of silk, rough and tangled if you will, but still containing many beautiful threads, whereof the skilful workman may make use. In other words the She King consists of a collection of ballads, odes, satires, elegies, and lampoons (most of which were once sung to music), such as are found in all nations in their imperfectly civilized stages. The exigencies of this paper induce me to make the following arbitrary divisions, which however often overlap each other:\n\n1. Idylls, including songs and poems on love, conjugal affection, country occupations and festivals, the chase, and so on.\n2. Songs and poems relating to war.\n3. Laudatory odes in honour of the deeds and glories of some great man, or the beauties and virtue of some princess.\n4. Satires and lampoons, and moral lessons.\n5. Festal and sacrificial odes.\n6. Fragments, and corrupt and imperfect pieces.\n\nThe versification, as is to be expected, is rough, and the text in countless instances is doubtful and corrupt, for not only has it been subjected to the efflux of over 2300 years at least, but the original editions, if I may use the term, were destroyed at the burning of the books in B.C. 213.\n\n---\n\n1 It must not be forgotten that the oldest of these poems have had to pass through three scripts before they could appear in their present form. The oldest style of Chinese character, the Ku Wen (\u53e4\u6587), was in use until about 800 B.C., when in the time of Hsian Wang (\u5ba3\u738b), of the Chou dynasty, the Ta Chuan (\u5927\u7bc6) or Large Seal character was introduced. This was succeeded\nFragments, the connection of which is unknown, are sometimes found by themselves, and at other times two or more are mixed together in such a way that no sense can be discovered in the poem as a whole; and occasionally we find a piece which becomes perfectly comprehensible if one stanza is omitted. But are not these flaws exactly what one expects in a work of this kind? Has not every old poem, Greek, Latin or English, hundreds of conjectural readings? Would the versification of Homer have passed muster in the time of Sophocles, or the rough diction of Beowulf or C\u00e6dmon compare with the elegant mastery of the English language shown by Tennyson and Swinburne? We all know King Canute's famous verse:\n\n\"Merie sungen the muneches binnen Ely\nTha Cnut ching renther by\nRoweth cnihtes noer the land\nAnd here we these muneches sing.\"\n\nGilbert \u00e0 Becket says of Canute, \"If he had known anything of sense or syntax, if he had been happy at description, or possessed the slightest share of imagination, he would have been a fair poet.\" Perhaps so, but let us imagine it possible that the verse above is in a foreign language, and is to be translated into modern English. Would it be unfair to alter it, and make it run thus?\n\n\"Merrily sung the monks of Ely\nWhen Canute the king was rowing thereby,\nRow to the shore, knights, said the king,\nAnd let us hear these good monks sing.\"\n\nSo with archaic Chinese poetry. Translate it into English as rough as the original form, and I say that you give an\n\nby the Hsiao Chuan (\u5c0f\u7bc6) or Small Seal character, which lasted from about 225 B.C. to about 350 A.D., when the Chiai Shu (\u6977\u66f8) took its place. Mons. Terrien de Lacouperie informs me that he has compared the oldest version of the Shu King or Classic of History, as published in the \u4e09\u5b57\u77f3\u7d93, with the present standard editions, and finds the discrepancies to amount to nearly 25 per cent. of the whole text. A comparison of the earliest and latest versions of the She King would surely show as large a proportion of error. See Prof. T. de Lacouperie, On the History of the Archaic Writing and Texts.\nunfair idea to foreigners of the beauties that lie hid in the original. The first requisite, therefore, for a verse translation of the poetry in question is modern language, and clear expressions in honest flowing metre. It is, further, the duty of the translator to avoid, as much as possible, the use of Chinese names, which are so repellent to the English reader. Let him also be granted a good deal of freedom in his renderings of trees and flowers, or at any rate let him confine his exactness to foot-notes. The jujube, the dolichos creeper, the polygonum and the broussonetia are not ornaments to verse, still less are the T'ung, the Yi, and the Tz\u016d trees.\n\nWhen first a little-known language is studied, the natural impulse of the student is to place himself blindfolded in the hands of scholars, whose native language is the one which the student seeks to acquire, for he feels that they, surely, are the men who know their own language best. This view may satisfy him for a while, but a time comes when he learns that there is a better path to take. Men who know nothing but their own language are the safest of all guides to a thorough acquaintance with that language. Critical acumen and the power of comparison and discrimination are essential to correct knowledge. These qualities seem wanting in all Orientals, and in none more than in the Chinese, with whom a sort of literary imagination, which invents non-existent difficulties, and a hankering desire for these very difficulties, appear to have taken their place. Mr. H. A. Giles has pointed this out so well in his Essay on Chinese Poetry. He says: \"Chinese prose and poetry alike, to be of any literary value, must bristle from beginning to end with allusions to the events and personages of their own almost immeasurable past. More than this. It is barely allowable to call anything by its right name, some figure of speech or half-expressed quotation\u2014and the more obscure the better\u2014must be called in to do duty in the place of the universally tabooed spade.\"\n\n1 \"Les Interpr\u00e8tes Chinois ne sont pas trop heureux \u00e0 d\u00e9chiffrer ces po\u00e9sies... Le style en est tr\u00e8s obscur, et cette obscurit\u00e9 vient sans doute du laconisme, des m\u00e9taphores, et de la quantit\u00e9 d'anciens proverbes, dont l'ouvrage est sem\u00e9.

Who would now accept the Chaldaic view of the Song of Solomon as an allegorical history of the Jewish people from the Exodus to the Messiah,\\(^1\\) or the medi\u00e6val Jewish view that the book represented the union between the active intellect and the receptive or material intellect? Professor Max M\u00fcller has warned us that the Pandits' own view of Indian history and literature (in which no doubt he includes Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit) is more apt to mislead their pupils than to guide them. My friend Mons. Terrien de Lacouperie, Professor of Indo-Chinese Philology in the University of London, has been the pioneer of this path where Chinese literature is concerned. He has shown us, in his translation of the Yi King, that the only proper method of finding the real meaning of the older canonical books is to take the Chinese characters as they stand and turn them into English, without making use of gloss or comment to force the unhappy things into bearing a distorted and fantastic meaning which they were never meant to bear. His paper on \"The Oldest Book of the Chinese\" has struck us all as a revelation, and though Dr. Legge, Canon McClatchie, and some of our older sinologues, may feel a momentary unwillingness to give up the accepted, i.e. the Chinese, views in which they have been educated, yet I do not doubt that Mons. Terrien de Lacouperie's explanations and interpretations of the Yi King must eventually be received by all as the only correct ones. A similar procedure should be brought to bear on the She King. He who would make a translation which would give Englishmen a true idea of the beauties contained in the\n\n\\(^1\\) Smith's Dictionary of the Bible, article Canticles, by T. E. Brown.\nwork, must of course study the commentaries, but must never give himself up blindly to their guidance, and allow them to take charge of him.\n\nDuring the last few years I have occupied some of my leisure time in attempting to make a simple metrical English version of the She King, working on the narrow lines prescribed above, and Mons. Terrien de Lacouperie has done me the great honour to invite me to come forward this afternoon and give some account of my humble labours and their result. My translation at present only goes as far as the 2nd book of part ii. I would not have ventured to stand up before you until I had completed my task, but I have to return to China shortly, and this therefore is my only opportunity, and is one that I felt that I ought not to neglect.\n\nThe ballads of country life in old China may be paralleled by dozens of pieces in Percy's Reliques, and when one reads the accounts of rustic merry-making, one's mind naturally turns to such poems as\n\n\"Come lasses and lads,\nGet leave of your dads,\nAnd away to the Maypole hie.\"\n\nThe Chinese verses on lads and lasses and man and maiden are just as full of innocent freedom as the best of our own, but the most harmless bit of fun or courtship is at once pounced on by the commentator as showing the lewd manners of the State from which the poem is supposed to have come. If you will allow me, I will read my version of two odes, one being the account of the Spring and the other of the Autumn Flower Festival:\n\n\"The Spring Flower Festival.\"\n\nGloomy winter's gone and past,\nStreams that lately lay asleep,\nIn their ice chains fettered fast,\nNow are running clear and deep.\n\n1 Part i. Book vii. Ode 21.\nLarge and level plains of grass\nOn the further side outspread,\nHaunts of many a lad and lass\nPlucking flowerets white and red.\n\n'Have you been across?' says she,\n'Yes,' he cries, 'indeed I've been.'\n'Come again and come with me,\nLet us two enjoy the scene.'\n\nEvery man and every maiden\nSport together hour by hour,\nWith a load of blossoms laden\nEach to each presents a flower.\"\n\n\"The Autumn Flower Festival.\"\n\n'Tis fair and lovely weather,\nWe will to town together,\nSo let your hemp and spinning-wheel to-day untouched remain;\nFor we are going straightway\nTo near the eastern gateway,\nWhere the white elms and the oak trees cast their shadow o'er\nthe plain.\n\nSee man and maid advancing\nTo meet each other, dancing,\nWith motions quick and graceful they nimbly turn and wheel.\nSays he, 'You are as fair, love,\nAs the blossom which you bear, love,\nGive me a flower in token that you care for what I feel.'\"\n\nCan one imagine anything more harmless or less suggestive\nof evil than the above? But what are the views of the com-\nmentators and their English disciples? The Little Preface\nsays that the former ballad was directed against the prevail-\ning disorder. The weapons of strife never rested, husbands\nand wives were torn from one another, lewd manners were\nprevalent, and there was no one to deliver the people from\n\n1 Part i. Book xii. Ode 2.\nDr. Legge's heading is \"A festivity of Ch'\u00eang, and the advantage taken of it for licentious assignation.\" The verdicts on the latter piece are still severer. The Little Preface remarks: \"This poem expresses disgust at the disorder which prevailed.\" Through the evil influence of Duke Y\u00fc, who was addicted to sensual pleasure, men and women abandoned their proper employments, hurried to meet one another on the roads, and danced and sang in the marketplaces.\" Dr. Legge, with almost equal sternness, heads the poem, \"Wanton associations of the young people of Ch'\u00ean.\"\n\nWhen in any of these odes, which may be included under the head of love poems, the heroine is not ashamed of her affection, she meets with scant mercy. Here, for example:\n\n\"A maiden fair and bright\nComes to greet me, when the night\nHas departed, and the eastern sky is red.\nBut lest some envious eye\nShould presume to play the spy,\nSoft and lightly o'er my pathway will she tread.\n\nDelights fade all too soon,\nComes the evening, and the moon\nRises full and round, my darling dares not stay.\nBut swiftly will she pass\nO'er my pathway in the grass,\nLest her footprints should our meeting-place betray.\"\n\nThe Little Preface remarks on this, that men and women of the State of Ch'i sought each other in lewd fashion, and Dr. Legge heads the piece as usual, \"The licentious intercourse of the people of Ch'i.\" Lord Macaulay once wrote a poem, from which I quote one stanza:\n\n1 \u5236\u4e82\u4e5f\u3002\u5175\u9769\u4e0d\u606f\u3002\u7537\u7236\u76f8\u68c4\u3002\u6deb\u98a8\u5927\u884c\u3002\n2 \u75be\u4e82\u4e5f\u3002\u5e7d\u516c\u6d6e\u8352\u3002\u98a8\u5316\u4e4b\u6240\u884c\u3002\u7537\u7236\u68c4\u5176\u820a\u696d\u3002\u4e9f\u6703\u65bc\u9053\u8def\u3002\u6b4c\u821e\u65bc\u5e02\u4e95\u723e\u3002\n\n3 Part i. Book viii. Ode 4.\n\u201cO fly, Madonna, fly,\nLest day and envy spy\nWhat only love and night may safely know.\nFly, and tread softly, dear,\nLest those who hate us hear\nThe sound of thy light footsteps as they go.\u201d\n\nWhat would his lordship\u2019s feelings have been if he could have seen this in any collection of English poetry headed \u201cThe licentious intercourse of the English people\u201d? When the lady is coy, the commentators ignore her coldness and the passion of her lover, and go out of their way to speak of the virtuous manners prevailing at the time and place, and of the admirable qualities of the ruler, whose influence has brought about this improvement. Take this verse for example:\n\n\u201cWhere the poplars throw but a scanty shade\nOn the banks of the Han, lives a lovely maid.\nI see her often, but find that vain\nAre all my efforts her heart to gain.\nAh no, \u2019tis as easy a task to strive\nTo cross the Han in a single dive,\nOr float on a plank down the Yangtz\u00fc\u2019s tide,\nAs win this lady to be my bride.\u201d\n\nThis shows, says the Preface, how the virtue of King W\u00ean affected the States of the south.\n\nLove between husband and wife, bride and bridegroom, and even between betrothed couples, is a little more fairly treated. Conjugal affection is one of the five cardinal relations among mankind. No fault, therefore, is to be found with it; but even in these cases Chinese scholars cannot get free of the idea that any poem on this subject is more to celebrate the good qualities of the ruler of the State than the attachment of the two parties. These pieces give the joys and sorrows of married life in considerable detail. In some\n\n1 Part i. Book i. Ode 9.\n2 \u6587\u738b\u4e4b\u9053\u88ab\u65bc\u5357\u570b.\nthe wives complain of their husbands' neglect and coldness, or of his attentions to some more favoured love or wife, for polygamy prevailed at the time when these ballads were written. We have also the longing of the wife for the safe return of her absent husband,\u00b9 and her joy when he gets back, in strains that recall the Scotch poem, \"There is nae luck aboot the hoose, when oor gudeman's awa.\"\n\nSeveral of the odes are epithalamiums, among others Ode 1 of Book ii. Part i. This has been translated into verse by Sir John Davis as follows:\n\n\"The nest yon winged artist builds\nThe robber bird shall tear away,\nSo yields her hopes the affianced maid,\nSome wealthy lord's reluctant prey.\n\nThe anxious bird prepares a nest,\nIn which the spoiler soon shall dwell.\nForth goes the weeping bride constrained,\nA hundred cars the triumph swell.\n\nMourn for the tiny architect;\nA stronger bird hath ta'en its nest.\nMourn for the hapless stolen bride,\nHow vain the pomp to soothe her breast.\"\n\nDr. Legge's metrical version is more literal and simpler, in fact almost too literal and simple:\n\n\"In the magpie's nest\nDwells the dove at rest.\nThis young bride goes to her future home,\nTo meet her a hundred chariots come.\n\n\u00b9 The ladies among the ancient Chinese, as among the Aryan nations, would leave their hair dishevelled during their husband's absence:\n\n\"I scarcely care to deck my hair,\nBut let my locks disorder'd stray,\nFor whom should I be neat or fair\nWhen my loved lord is far away?\"\u2014Part i. Book v. Ode 8.\n\n\"Ten months Runjeet lay in Lahore.\nWah, a hero's heart is brass.\nTen months never did Chunda Kour\nBraid her hair at the tiring glass.\"\u2014Edwin Arnold.\nOf the magpie's nest\nIs the dove possest.\nThis bride goes to her new home to live,\nAnd welcome a hundred chariots give.\n\nThe nest magpie wove\nNow filled by the dove.\nThis bride now takes to her home her way,\nAnd there numerous cars her state display.\"\n\nNow surely the motive of this little piece is the same as that of King Cophetua and the Beggar-maid, the Lord of Burleigh, and a dozen similar poems. The Prince is the magpie, the strong handsome skilful bird, the peasant girl the dove, who does not fight the magpie and rob him of his nest, as the Chinese commentators say, and Sir John Davis implies, but who by her softness and gentleness persuades him to allow her to occupy the comfortable nest for which magpies are famous, as every birdsnesting schoolboy knows. A paraphrase seems necessary to bring out the force of the original, and I have therefore ventured to write this version, which I admit is not a close translation:\n\n\"The dove, that gentle timid bird,\nSmall wit hath she a nest to build;\nUnlike the pie, whose home well lined\nWithin, and framed with labour skilled,\nMight seem a palace, yet the dove\nWill to herself appropriate\nThe magpie's nest, and snug therein\nDwell in contentment with her mate.\n\nMy sweet, thou art the gentle dove.\nHad fate's decree then nought more fair\nFor thee, than in these barren fields\nA peasant's hut and toils to share.\nMy lands are wide, my halls are high,\nAnd steeds and cars attend my call,\nMy dove within my magpie nest,\nThou shalt be mistress of them all.\"\nLastly, we have verses by the inferior wives in honour of the chief lady of the palace, although I am bound to confess that many of them have not a very genuine ring about them. There is, however, one very pretty farewell, supposed to be written by one widowed wife, when another lady, who was also a wife of the deceased, took her departure. This is it:\n\n\"She who for many years has been my friend,\nA gentle one and kind and most sincere,\nDeparts for her own country, and an end\nHas come to all I once considered dear.\nDecorous was her person, though one love\nWe shared, no jealous doubt nor angry hate\nCould e'er disturb her; nay, she rather strove\nMy zeal and care for him to stimulate.\nFar did I journey southwards, ere good-byes\nWere uttered, then she left me, and in vain\nI gazed at her departing, for my eyes\nWere blinded with the tears that fell like rain.\nI watched the swallows in their flickering flight,\nThey too go southwards, when the summer's o'er;\nThey will return when spring is warm and bright,\nBut my beloved friend comes back no more.\"\n\nNor are poems wanting descriptive of country life and its labours and enjoyments. The best and most complete of these is the 1st Ode of the 15th Book of Part i., but it is too long to quote in full. The date assigned to this ballad is B.C. 1100 or thereabouts. It is a narration of a state of things some 700 years before that. It shows that the ancient Chinese had a great respect for the pursuit of agriculture, a respect which theoretically, at any rate, their descendants still retain.\n\nWe also find short odes or songs illustrating various pursuits. There is the song of the plantain-gatherers,\n\n---\n\n1 Part i. Book iii. Ode 3.\n2 It is worth noticing that even in the oldest poems there are scarcely any references to sheep. The ancestors of the Chinese, unlike their Aryan contemporaries or predecessors, were not a people among whom the chief shepherd was practically a king. See Les Origines Indo-Europ\u00e9ennes, Pietet.\nseveral hunting-songs of the 'John Peel' type, and longer pieces describing the chase and celebrating the skill and prowess of the hunters. Fish and fishing are constantly alluded to, but this pursuit does not form the main subject of any ode. There is an account of a trapper, who was so stalwart a man that he might well be the body guard and comrade of a prince. We have likewise a little piece containing a dialogue between two carpenters, at least so I translate it:\u00b9\n\nA says:\n\"I have got to make a handle, but there is not any good\nIn beginning, for I have not got an axe to hew the wood.\nLike a fellow who would marry, but his chance of wedlock's shady,\nFor he does not know a person to present him to the lady.\"\n\nB replies:\n\"Go to work and shape the handle, don't make any lame excuse,\nThe pattern you've to copy is laid ready for your use,\nLike a baffled suitor, say you, nay you're rather like a lord,\nWith his bride beside him and a feast set out upon the board.\"\n\nAll the Chinese critics say that this poem is in praise of a certain duke. Dr. Legge heads his metrical translation, \"While there is a proper and necessary way for everything, men need not go far to find what it is.\" His verses are:\n\n\"In hewing an axe shaft, how must you act?\nAnother axe take, or you'll never succeed.\nIn taking a wife, be sure 'tis a fact\nThat with no go-between you never can speed.\nIn hewing an axe shaft, hewing a shaft,\nFor a copy you have the axe in your hand.\nIn choosing a wife, you follow the craft,\nAnd forthwith on the mats the feast vessels stand.\"\n\nI would refer you to the Marquis D'Hervey St. Denys's\n\n\u00b9 Part i. Book xv. Ode 5.\nwork, *Poesies de l'\u00e9poque des Th'ang*, for a complete description of Chinese warlike poetry. I find among the odes in the She King, which relate to warfare, a few breathing out martial aspirations, but a greater number complaining of the hardships of the campaign, and expressing a homesick longing to get back again. Assuredly the feeling expressed in the Chinese proverb of to-day,\n\n\u597d\u9435\u4e0d\u6253\u4e01  \n\u597d\u4eba\u4e0d\u505a\u5175\n\n\"You don't beat good iron into a nail, or make a good man into a soldier,\" was known to the ancestors of the modern Chinese. Even in the most bellicose odes, the only thing celebrated is the pomp and gorgeous array of the army, and the success of some prince or general. There is not one word expressive of\n\n\"The stern joy which warriors feel  \nIn foemen worthy of their steel.\"\n\nThere is not even a description of a single combat between two men. Still less can we find any generous mention of the bravery of an enemy, for chivalry is utterly and entirely wanting. One cannot help feeling that these warlike odes have been made to order. On the other hand, the poems which describe the hardships of war are only too real and heartfelt. Their genuineness makes them pleasing. Here is one of the best in my opinion:\n\n\"Oh many a weary night we spent,  \nAnd many a dreary day,  \nOn those eastern hills, with no roof o'erhead,  \nSave the carts under which we lay.\n\nWhen the rains began, then the word was passed  \nThat our service at length was o'er,  \nWe might doff our armour and wear the clothes  \nThat our wives had prepared once more.\n\n1 Part i. Book xv. Ode 3.\nYet a haunting fear would disturb my heart,\nThis thought would flash to the brain,\nI have been long gone, shall I find all changed,\nWhen I visit my home again?\n\nPerchance the creepers and trailing weeds\nHave choked up my unused doors,\nAnd the woodlouse creeps, and the spider weaves\nHis web o'er my empty floors.\n\nThe deer graze careless about the fields\nWhere I pastured my sheep and kine,\nAnd around the desolate garden plots\nThe lamps of the glowworm shine.\n\nWe marched along through the drizzling rain,\nWe noted the signs of spring,\nOn the mulberry leaves the silkworms fed,\nAnd we heard the oriole sing.\n\nIts yellow plumage was shining bright\nAs it glanced in a moment by,\nAnd we heard the cranes, as they caught their prey\nOn the ant hillocks, scream and cry.\n\nEre I knew it, there was my home in sight,\nSince I such a sight had seen\nThree years had passed, yet the rooms were swept,\nAnd my dwelling was warm and clean.\n\nAnd gourds were hanging, for me to eat,\nOn the boughs of the chestnut tree,\nNo moment while I was far away,\nMy wife had forgotten me.\n\nYou may talk of the glories when youth and maid\nAre wed, and their troth is plighted,\nBut not of the joy when two loving hearts,\nOnce parted, are re-united.\"\n\n8. Our next division contains the laudatory odes or poems celebrating the achievements of some king, prince, or chiefman, or the virtues and beauties of some princess. The\nChinese commentators, if left to themselves, would include the greater part of the She King under this heading, but even after an elimination of scores of pieces as having nothing to do with royalty or aristocracy, a considerable residue remains. Some of the pieces are curious, but the bulk of them are of no great interest to the general reader. Here is a little poem complete in one verse, which may remind you of something that you have heard before:\n\n\"That pear-tree, woodman, spare,\nBreak not a single bough;\nShao's chief once rested there,\nLeave it uninjured now.\"\n\nThe legend of Hou Chi, especially as translated by Dr. Legge's nephew, is very well worthy of perusal, but is too long to quote.\n\n4. We pass on to satires and lampoons and moral lessons. Satire in small and youthful communities is usually very personal in its application. In the personal satires and lampoons of the She King, although names are not often openly given, they can be easily fitted to the verse without much doubt as to the correctness of the application. For example, the heir-apparent of a certain duke was engaged to marry a lady; but the father, inflamed by the reports of her beauty, had a tower built on the banks of a river which the lady had to pass on her way to the bridegroom's home, enticed her into it, and kept her for himself. Afterwards he had his heir-apparent and another son murdered. These rather doggerel lines refer to the first of the two crimes:\n\n\"A fisherman for fish a trap may set,\nAnd catch a goose entangled in the net.\nThis hunchback, too, contrived a snare to lay,\nAnother's bride he stole and bore away.\n\n1 Part i. Book ii. Ode 5.\n2 Part iii. Book ii. Ode 1.\n3 Part i. Book iii. Ode 18.\nBeside the stream a lofty tower he built,\nWhere he might safely perpetrate his guilt.\nNo pleasant mate the lady found, alas!\nShe gained instead this vicious bloated mass.\"\n\nThese lines allude to the second:\u00b9\n\n\"The two youths journeyed down the stream;\nI noted, as they left the shore,\nTheir shadows on the water gleam;\nAh, shall we ever see them more?\nFloated their boats away from here.\nI watch for them in vain, and say,\nAs they return not, much I fear\nSome danger met them on the way.\"\n\nCan we not imagine these verses repeated from mouth to mouth among the people? I conjecture that the latter piece may be a fragment from a longer ballad.\n\nSatire directed against classes and types of men, rather than against individuals, is more interesting than the personal attacks mentioned above. Sometimes a moral lesson is to be learnt from a natural object; from a quail, for instance, which will fight in defence of its chickens, or from a rat, which fills the place in the world which nature intended for it:\u00b2\n\n\"Nature has made the rat the worst of vermin,\nTeeth, limbs, and skin she gave unto the brute.\nLet it use these as nature's laws determine,\nNo blame unto the rat we dare impute.\nBut nobler gifts she gave to man to cherish:\nDignity, self-control and love of right;\nAnd better were it that a man should perish,\nThan scorn these godlike gifts or hold them light.\"\n\nA moral lesson is also drawn from the rainbow.\u00b3 The Chinese of that era held that the rainbow and other heavenly\n\n\u00b9 Part i. Book iii. Ode 19.\n\u00b2 Part i. Book iv. Ode 8.\n\u00b3 Part i. Book iv. Ode 7.\nbodies must not be pointed at, but be passed with averted eyes. Young ladies are warned that if they elope, they too will become objects to be passed with averted eyes. The lash of satire falls on stinginess, as shown by a rich bridegroom who would not afford leather shoes in winter, and made his bride make and mend his clothes for him.\\footnote{Part i. Book ix. Ode 1.} The elegant officers who went in court dress to collect leaves and herbs for soup are also held up to ridicule.\\footnote{Part i. Book ix. Ode 2.} Nor do dissipation, frivolity, pretence, and neglect of decent observances escape. Then the advice of Horace, 'Carpe diem,' forms the subject of more than one ode. Here is a specimen:\\footnote{Part i. Book x. Ode 2. This ode has a burden prefiguring each of the stanzas; but as I can find no congruity in it, I have suppressed it.}\n\n\"Great store you have of trailing robes and long,\nWhich lie and moulder useless and unworn.\nYour cars are handsome and your steeds are strong,\nBut yet along the streets you ne'er are borne.\n\nCourtyards it has, the mansion where you dwell,\nAnd halls, where no one comes the dust to sweep,\nWith many a drum and sweetly ringing bell,\nWhich ever mute and voiceless lie asleep.\n\nWhy stint and spare, for surely it were best\nWith wine and dainties to prolong the day,\nTo cheer the hours, and give to mirth a zest,\nSo take your lute and sing a merry lay.\n\nThink, all-destroying death comes creeping near,\nWhen our most cherished goods, our hoarded stores,\nShall be the stranger's, who shall take our gear,\nShall spend our riches, and shall tread our floors.\"\n\nWe may also, perhaps, include under the head of odes conveying a moral lesson, those in praise of humility and contentment, and even those applauding a love of solitude and asceticism.\n5. With regard to festal and sacrificial odes, I must throw myself on your mercy, and request your indulgence. These odes are mainly contained in parts 2, 3 and 4, which I have as yet examined too cursorily to be able to give a positive opinion on them; but by what I have read of them, I am led to believe that most of them might well be relegated to the category either of war pieces or of laudatory odes. The lines in Campbell's poem, \"The Battle of the Baltic,\"\n\n\"Now joy old England raise,\nFor the tidings of thy might,\nBy the festal city's blaze,\nWhile the wine-cup shines in light,\"\n\nwould assuredly have induced a commentator of the Chinese school to include the whole piece under the head of festal odes.\n\n6. I pass on to the last division, namely, fragments and corrupt pieces. These are mainly found in the first part. Take the 3rd stanza of the 10th Ode of Book i. At the close of a pretty little set of verses, spoken by a wife delighted at her husband's return, are these lines. I quote Dr. Legge's prose version:\n\n\"The bream is showing his tail all red.\nThe royal house is like a blazing fire;\nThough it be like a blazing fire,\nYour parents are very near.\"\n\nThe commentators try in vain to torture a meaning out of the characters, by suggesting that the bream has torn its tail in its efforts to get up stream, and that the wife exhorts her husband to work as hard as the bream, although his rulers may be as cruel and all-devouring as fire, adding that he must not disgrace his parents, who are standing near watching him. Chu 'Hsi, followed by Strauss, says that the 'parents' are the same rulers, who are watching his exertions. Granting, for the sake of argument, that the lines do bear this horribly strained and distorted meaning, are they not utterly out of place in this conjuncture? Must we not cut them out remorselessly, nor allow them to spoil a pretty little\npoem? Again, take the following ode, which this time I quote from Dr. Legge's metrical version:\n\n\"Not for the stormy wind,\nNor rushing chariot's roar;\nBut when I view the road to Chow,\nI'm pained to my heart's core.\n\nNot for the whirlwind's sweep,\nNor car's unsteady roll,\nBut when I view the road to Chow,\nDeep sadness dulls my soul.\n\nFor him who fish can cook,\nHis boilers I would clear,\nSo him, whose heart beats westward true,\nWith these good words I cheer.\"\n\nDr. Legge's translation is a thoroughly literal construc of each of the Chinese characters, but still I must confess myself as unable to understand the English version as I am the Chinese.\n\nAnother ode Dr. Legge translates as follows:\n\n\"Those officers of state\nHave their carriers of lances and halberds,\nBut these creatures\nWith their three hundred red covers for the knees.\n\nThe pelican is on the dam,\nAnd will not wet his wings.\nThese creatures\nAre not equal to their dress.\n\nThe pelican is on the dam,\nAnd will not wet his beak.\nThese creatures\nDo not respond to the favour they enjoy.\n\n1 Part i. Book xiii. Ode 4.\n2 Part i. Book xiv. Ode 2.\"\nExtensive and luxuriant is the vegetation,\nAnd up the south hill in the morning rise the vapours.\nTender is she and lovely,\nBut the young lady is suffering from hunger.\"\n\nIn his metrical version Dr. Legge has managed to write a comprehensible poem, but only by an immense amount of interpolation, and by a paraphrase so free, that it can scarcely be supported by the original. In this and in similar cases, is not the translator safer in saying boldly, \"There is no meaning in this, I will pass on to the next\"? Such fragments as this:\u00b9\n\n\"Through the fields the livelong day\nMulberry planters idly stray.\nThere is nothing here to do,\nLet me go away with you.\"\n\nare comprehensible enough, but call for little remark. Is the translator bound to explain the allusions, or to fill up the missing portions? May he not be content to treat them as fragments only?\n\nMany of the odes relating to men and their actions begin with a mention of some object of natural history. For instance:\u00b2\n\n\"The mulberry tree on the mountain grows,\nNo beautiful youth like Tzit Tu I see.\nAnd down in the marshes the lotus blows,\nBut this young madcap makes love to me.\"\n\nSurely the allusions to the trees and the lotus plants were only put in to make a burden to the song after the fashion so common in ancient Scandinavian poetry; but the commentators say that the mountains and marshes were all furnished with what was proper to them. It was not so with the speaker and her friends. The very next ode begins thus:\n\n\"The withered leaves, the withered leaves,\nThe winds are blowing them away;\nGive us the key-note of the song,\nYou'll find us join you in the lay.\"\n\n\u00b9 Part i. Book ix. Ode 5. \u00b2 Part i. Book vii. Ode 10.\nThe commentators here change from the negative to the positive with startling rapidity, and say that this is metaphorical of the troubles which were afflicting the State. Not that I believe that the song has anything to do with State affairs, although this is Dr. Legge's interpretation.\n\nI admit that in many cases mention is made of the bird on the bough, the flowers in bloom, the pines on the hill side, the elm trees in the meadow, or the fruit tree loaded with fruit, because either the person who is supposed to speak wishes to describe a scene before him, or the author desires to indicate a particular season, but many instances remain in which the only explanation is that in old Chinese poetry, as in old European poetry and its imitations, a burden is a favourite device of the poet.\n\nMy only aim has been to try and point out that the pieces of which the She King is composed are not rough archaic curiosities of no interest except to the specialist. Nor again are they like Chinese poetry of the present day, wonderful examples of verbal antithesis, but of no more real poetic value to anyone except the unfortunate competitive examinees who have to compose verses on the same model, than the Latin and Greek verses at our schools and universities. With all their irregularities, I claim that they are poems not unworthy the attention of all true lovers of poetry. The prosody of the odes,\u00b9 the chronology and history contained in the book, together with the examples found therein of primitive manners, culture, and religion,\u00b2 I leave for the\n\n\u00b9 The secret of the prosody has yet to be discovered. I venture to think that the clue must be sought for in the Ku Wen, whence we shall find that certain characters, which are now monosyllabic, were once dis-syllabic or even polysyllabic. I am indebted to Mons. Terrien de Lacouperie for this hint.\n\n\u00b2 I would call attention to one fact only, viz. that in the She King is perhaps the first mention of Sati ['Suttee'], unless the Mahabharata, which describes the sacrifice of Madri, the best beloved wife of Pandu, at her husband's tomb, is older. Ode 6 of the 11th book of the 1st part alludes to the death of a prince at whose grave three of the bravest warriors of the nation were put to death. Herodotus (book iv. 71) mentions a similar custom among the Scythians. When the king dies he is buried in the country of the Gerhi. \"In the remaining space of the grave they bury one of the king's concubines, having strangled her, and his cup-bearer, a cook, a groom, a page, a courier and horses, and firstlings of everything. A year afterwards fifty of the king's horses and fifty of his servants are strangled and stuffed with chaff, and stuck round the king's monument.\"\n\n\"\u0395\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03c0\u1fc7 \u03b5\u1f50\u03c1\u03c5\u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u1fb3 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\nresearches of other and abler students, adding at the same time my humble testimony to the richness of the mine which they have to work; but I hope that I may be spared to continue and complete my own task as far as my powers will permit me.

XXI.\u2014Note sur les mots Sanscrits compos\u00e9s avec \u092a\u0924\u093f.\n\nPar J. van den Gheyn, S.J., M.R.A.S.\n\nLe terme \u092a\u0924\u093f, ma\u00eetre, seigneur, entre fr\u00e9quemment comme second membre dans les compos\u00e9s sanscrits. Il n\u2019est pas toujours ais\u00e9 de se rendre compte de la mani\u00e8re dont les deux parties du mot se sont soud\u00e9es l\u2019une \u00e0 l\u2019autre. Plusieurs cas pr\u00e9sentent des difficult\u00e9s qui ont mis la sagacit\u00e9 des grammairiens \u00e0 la torture.\n\nNous voulons essayer de l\u00e9gitimer ces anomalies. \u00c9videmment, ce travail ne doit porter que sur les compos\u00e9s dont la forme semble se refuser aux explications traditionnelles. Le plus souvent en effet, les termes sanscrits o\u00f9 entre le mot \u092a\u0924\u093f ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9s sur le mod\u00e8le des autres compos\u00e9s, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire ou par simple juxtaposition des th\u00e8mes (dvandras) ou au moyen d\u2019une d\u00e9sinence casuelle affectant le premier membre et indiquant le rapport qui existe entre les deux parties constitutives (tatpurushas).\n\nAinsi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9s : d\u2019apr\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re m\u00e9thode, \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092a\u0924\u093f, \u0926\u0902\u092a\u0924\u093f ;\u00b9 d\u2019apr\u00e8s la seconde \u092c\u093e\u0932\u094d\u092f\u092a\u0924\u093f, \u0926\u093f\u0935\u094d\u092f\u092a\u0924\u093f.\n\n\u00b9 Ce mot \u0926\u0902\u092a\u0924\u093f nous fournit l\u2019occasion de r\u00e9futer une erreur assez grave commise autrefois par Haug qui rapprochait du sanscrit le zend d\u00e9ngpaiti. Haug faisait de d\u00e9ng une contraction de damas, g\u00e9nitif d\u2019un mot suppos\u00e9 dam \u201cmaison\u201d (compar\u00e9 domus ?). Or c\u2019est l\u00e0 de l\u2019arbitraire le plus complet : il est impossible que d\u00e9ng repr\u00e9sente jamais dam. Du reste ce dernier mot est invent\u00e9 par Haug. Enfin le sens de \u201cma\u00eetre de la maison\u201d donn\u00e9 par Haug \u00e0 d\u00e9ngpaiti ne saurait convenir \u00e0 la phrase du Yacna (xliv. 11 vers. 4). Il n\u2019y est pas du tout question de chef de famille, mais de sage, de docteur de la loi : en tout cas, la version pehlevie donne tort \u00e0 Haug. L\u2019explication de Justi offre aussi des difficult\u00e9s. Il pense que d\u00e9ng est pour d\u0101n, d\u0101n, accusatif pluriel d\u2019un mot d\u0101, qui ne se rencontre que dans l\u2019expression h\u016bd\u0101 (sanscrit \u0939\u0942\u0926\u093e) \u201cdou\u00e9 d\u2019une bonne sagesse.\u201d Cette racine d\u0101 se retrouve dans le grec \u03b4\u03ac\u03c2, \u03b4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1, \u03b4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9. Mais encore une fois l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de Justi se heurte au sens de la phrase dans laquelle entre le mot d\u00e9ngpaiti. Nous croyons pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de voir dans d\u00e9ng l\u2019accusatif d\u0101m de d\u0101 \u201csagesse,\u201d ou m\u00eame d\u0101n signifiant \u201csagesse.\u201d Dans ce cas, d\u00e9ngpaiti serait \u201cle ma\u00eetre de la sagesse, le chef de la loi sainte.\u201d Nous sommes ainsi d\u2019accord avec la version pehlevie qui rend d\u00e9ngpaiti par docteur, pr\u00eatre, connaissant la religion. Quoiqu\u2019il en soit, le mot d\u00e9ng n\u2019en est pas moins un terme fort obscur et notre explication n\u2019est pas autre chose qu\u2019une conjecture plus ou moins plausible.\nLes formations de ce genre n\u2019ont besoin d\u2019aucun \u00e9claircissement. Mais il n\u2019en est pas de m\u00eame pour les six compos\u00e9s suivants: \u0906\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f, \u092a\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f, \u0935\u0928\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f, \u0930\u093e\u0927\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f, \u092d\u0924\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f, \u0930\u0925\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f. Ces termes r\u00e9sistent aux interpr\u00e9tations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales.\n\nPlusieurs savants linguistes ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 tent\u00e9 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de ces mots, toutefois en passant et d\u2019une mani\u00e8re assez incompl\u00e8te ou m\u00eame peu satisfaisante. Nous voulons aborder la question de front et soumettre \u00e0 un examen sp\u00e9cial les termes que nous venons de citer.\n\n\u00a7 1. \u0906\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f, \u092a\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f.\n\nIl nous para\u00eet convenable de commencer pour ces deux mots et de ne pas les s\u00e9parer dans cette recherche, parce que leur nature tout \u00e0 fait similaire permettra de leur appliquer les m\u00eames principes de solution.\n\nUn mot d\u2019abord sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments formatifs gn\u0101 et j\u0101. Le premier est un terme v\u00e9dique usit\u00e9 surtout au pluriel et signifiant \u201cfemme divine, d\u00e9esse.\u201d Gn\u0101spati, c\u2019est donc l\u2019\u201c\u00e9poux d\u2019une d\u00e9esse.\u201d Quant \u00e0 j\u0101, il veut dire \u201cdescendant.\u201d J\u0101spati par cons\u00e9quent, c\u2019est le chef de la race.\n\nIl s\u2019agit maintenant d\u2019expliquer les formes gn\u0101s et j\u0101s des deux compos\u00e9s.\n\nOn a \u00e9mis l\u2019opinion que dans gn\u0101spati l\u2019s doit se prendre comme lettre intercal\u00e9e et l\u2019on affirmait que souvent dans le V\u00e9da les consonnes p ou k admettent devant elles l\u2019une des siffantes, dentale ou linguale, comme on le voit par les noms propres Brhaspati, Brahmanaspati. Cependant dans l\u2019exemple en question on reconnaissait une attraction plus forte que celle de ce genre de Sandhi, attraction qui aurait li\u00e9 euphoniquement la siffante s au son labial du p suivant.\n\nCette premi\u00e8re explication est de tout point insuffisante. En effet pour bien des cas o\u00f9 la raison d\u2019euphonie suppos\u00e9e existe, on ne constate pas d\u2019insertion de siffante. N\u2019a-t-on pas acvapati, dasapati ? Bien plus. Comment justifier j\u0101spati par la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de l\u2019intercalation d\u2019une siffante alors que le compos\u00e9 praj\u0101pati vient \u00e9videmment contredire cette pr\u00e9tendue n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 ? Quant aux exemples cit\u00e9s de Brhaspati,\nBrahmanaspati, ce sont des compos\u00e9s du genre tatpurusha, cas b\u1e5bhas et brahmanas sont respectivement les g\u00e9nitifs de b\u1e5bh et de brahman.\n\nGrassmann voyait dans j\u0101s le nominatif de j\u0101 : aussi traduisait-il j\u0101spati par la p\u00e9riphrase suivante \"la maison et son chef.\"\u00b9\n\nMais les r\u00e8gles de la composition des mots en sanscrit s'opposent \u00e0 cette mani\u00e8re de voir. En effet aucun compos\u00e9 n'admet les mots au nominatif. Ou bien deux mots unissent leurs th\u00e8mes et le second seul prend les d\u00e9sinences casuelles ; c'est le cas des compos\u00e9s drandras ; ou bien il y a un rapport entre les deux membres, rapport exprim\u00e9 par une flexion du premier ; ce sont les compos\u00e9s tatpurushas.\n\nVoil\u00e0 pourquoi, il n'y a, quant aux formes gn\u0101spati et j\u0101spati, que deux interpr\u00e9tations possibles, vu la formation ordinaire des compos\u00e9s sanscrits. Gn\u0101s, j\u0101s sont des g\u00e9nitifs, ou bien ils sont respectivement les th\u00e8mes des mots gn\u0101 et j\u0101.\n\nCes deux explications ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enseign\u00e9es. Dans son Dictionnaire, Monier Williams pr\u00e9tend que gn\u0101s est un g\u00e9nitif abr\u00e9g\u00e9, \"a shortened genitive.\" Il est moins affirmatif quand il s'agit de j\u0101s, car il note son opinion d'un point d'interrogation.\u00b2 Mais la plupart des auteurs, comme Pictet,\u00b3 B\u00f6htlingk et Roth,\u2074 Lanman,\u2075 sont unanimes \u00e0 voir dans j\u0101s le g\u00e9nitif de j\u0101.\n\nIl est certain qu'il manque seulement \u00e0 gn\u0101s et j\u0101s, pour \u00eatre r\u00e9guliers, d'avoir l'a bref au lieu de l'a long, car le g\u00e9nitif classique est gnas, jas. Peut-\u00eatre les anomalies ou plut\u00f4t les divergences de la d\u00e9clinaison v\u00e9dique suffisent-elles \u00e0 rendre compte de ce l\u00e9ger \u00e9cart ?\n\nL'\u00e9cole philologique contemporaine voit dans les formes gn\u0101s et j\u0101s la racine des mots gn\u0101 et j\u0101. \"Si l'on a \u00e9gard, dit Johann Schmidt, \u00e0 ce qu'enseigne Brugman de l'origine des formes comme ush\u0101m et ush\u0101s qu'il croit issues de *ush\u0101s-m, *ush\u0101s-ns, et de l'existence d'un th\u00e8me ush\u0101, on ne peut con-\n\n\u00b9 W\u00f6rterbuch zum Rig-Veda, p. 485.\n\u00b2 Sanskrit-English Dictionary, sub verbo.\n\u00b3 Les Aryas primitifs, t. iii, p. 381, 2nd. \u00e9d.\n\u2074 Dictionnaire de St.-P\u00e9tersbourg, sub verbo j\u0101spati.\n\u2075 On Noun-Inflection in the Veda, p. 448.\nvenablement douter que la racine du mot *j\u0101s* soit *j\u0101s* et non *j\u0101*, qu'elle a gard\u00e9 la sifflante dans les compos\u00e9s primitifs o\u00f9 celle-ci \u00e9tait prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par *p*, mais l'a perdue r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement devant *m* et *ns*, et par suite *j\u0101s* a \u00e9t\u00e9 assimil\u00e9 par analogie aux th\u00e8mes en *a* dont il se rapprochait du reste par le genre.\u00b9\n\nL'hypoth\u00e8se d'une racine *j\u0101s* se fortifie encore du fait de l'existence du g\u00e9nitif *praj\u0101sas*, comme l'indique du reste le Dr. Schmidt ; mais il aurait pu faire remarquer encore que la langue sanscrite poss\u00e8de plusieurs autres racines monosyllabiques en *\u0101s* ; telles sont *bh\u0101s* \"lumi\u00e8re,\" qui a fourni le compos\u00e9 *bh\u0101spati*, similaire de *j\u0101spati* ; *k\u0101s*, \"toux\" ; *m\u0101s* \"lune\" ;\u00b2 *c\u0101s* \"chantre.\" Pour ces raisons nous pensons devoir nous rallier \u00e0 l'explication du Dr. Schmidt, quant \u00e0 *j\u0101spati*.\n\nMais faut-il en dire autant de *gn\u0101s* ? Telle n'est pas notre conviction, car la solution pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente ne nous para\u00eet pas pr\u00e9senter un caract\u00e8re d'universalit\u00e9 suffisante pour pouvoir \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 d'autres cas. C'est sans contredit la forme *praj\u0101sas*, qui constitue \u00e0 nos yeux la preuve la plus solide de l'existence d'un th\u00e8me *j\u0101s*.\n\nPour *gn\u0101s*, nous ne poss\u00e9dons pas cette preuve. Il est donc n\u00e9cessaire de recourir \u00e0 une autre interpr\u00e9tation.\n\nMonier Williams nous para\u00eet \u00eatre dans le vrai en disant que *gn\u0101s* est un vrai g\u00e9nitif, mais il n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 cette assertion. Essayons de fournir cette d\u00e9monstration.\n\nGrassmann, dans son *W\u00f6rterbuch zum Rig-Veda*,\u00b3 fait une remarque tr\u00e8s juste et qui nous semble ouvrir la voie \u00e0 une solution satisfaisante. \"Les formes *gn\u0101s*, *gn\u0101m*, dit-il, ainsi que *gn\u0101s* dans *gn\u0101spati* doivent \u00eatre prononc\u00e9es plut\u00f4t en deux \u00e9missions de voix, comme *gan\u0101s*, *gan\u0101m*.\" Et cons\u00e9quemment \u00e0 cette observation, il met entre parenth\u00e8se, comme moins correcte, la forme *gn\u0101spati* pour donner *gan\u0101spati*. Pourtant ce dernier mot ne se rencontre pas dans le Rig-V\u00e9da ; il est cr\u00e9\u00e9 par l'auteur. Lanman se rallie \u00e0 cette explica-\n\n\u00b9 *Zeitschrift f\u00fcr vergl.

On ne remarque pas sans un certain \u00e9tonnement que presque tous les idiomes con\u00e7\u00e8nes attestent l'existence d'une forme analogue \u00e0 \\(gan\u0101\\). Le zend a \\(ghena\\), contract\u00e9 plus tard en \\(ghn\u0101\\); en vieux-prussien on trouve \\(ganna\\), en slov\u00e8ne \\(shena\\) devenu \\(zona\\) pour le polonais.

Car \\(\\delta\u03b5-\\sigma\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2\\) est apparent\u00e9 au sanscrit \\(d\u0101sapat\u012b\\), et le latin \\(sponte\\) appartient \u00e0 une s\u00e9rie th\u00e9matique dans laquelle n'entre pas\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Remarques sur l'\u00e9tymologie et le sens primitif du mot \u0398\u0395\u039f\u03a3, dans les Annales de la Facult\u00e9 des Lettres de Lyon, 1\u00e8re ann\u00e9e, p. 54 du fasc. 3.\npati. Il n\u2019est donc pas possible de se rallier \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se de M. Regnaud, que du reste Corssen semble avoir devanc\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il d\u00e9compose le mot sanscrit v\u0101stospati de la mani\u00e8re suivante v\u0101sto-spati.\u00b9 C\u2019est l\u00e0 une erreur profonde. V\u0101stospati est en effet compos\u00e9 de v\u0101stos, g\u00e9nitif de v\u0101stu, et de pati.\n\nPour revenir \u00e0 vanaspati, la difficult\u00e9 d\u2019expliquer ranas, alors que la forme classique est rana, n\u2019est qu\u2019apparente, puisque, nous allons le d\u00e9montrer, vanas peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 ou comme un g\u00e9nitif ou comme une racine.\n\nIl peut \u00eatre le g\u00e9nitif d\u2019un mot van r\u00e9ellement existant d\u2019ailleurs dans la langue et dont on retrouve des traces au locatif et au g\u00e9nitif pluriel dans le Rig-V\u00e9da o\u00f9 nous lisons \u0935\u0928\u094b \u0928 \u092c\u0902\u0938\u0941\u00b2 et \u0935\u0928\u094b \u092c\u0928\u093e\u092e\u00b3. Nous voil\u00e0 donc suffisamment autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 voir dans vanaspati la trace d\u2019un g\u00e9nitif.\n\nD\u2019autre part rien ne s\u2019oppose non plus \u00e0 ce que nous voyions dans vanas une forme th\u00e9matique. En effet en pr\u00e9sence des compos\u00e9s vanargu, vanarshad on doit admettre un th\u00e8me vanar. D\u00e8s lors on est amen\u00e9 \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un compos\u00e9 vanarpati\u2074 devenu vanaspati par le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne connu de la liquide chang\u00e9e en sifflante. Mais il y a bien mieux, puisqu\u2019\u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de vanar, nous avons aussi vanas qui donne directement vanaspati.\n\nNous admettons plut\u00f4t la seconde hypoth\u00e8se, bien que la premi\u00e8re soit irr\u00e9prochable, parce que la seconde s\u2019applique mieux aux compos\u00e9s suivants.\n\nIl y a pour l\u2019explication de ratha\u015bpati les m\u00eames difficult\u00e9s que pour vanaspati, car la th\u00e8me est ratha, \u201cchar.\u201d\n\nQuoiqu\u2019en disent Monier Williams\u2075 et B\u00f6htlingk,\u2076 il ne faut pas songer \u00e0 faire de rathas un g\u00e9nitif. Le premier de ces auteurs renvoie \u00e0 vanaspati : le cas est bien diff\u00e9rent puisqu\u2019\u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de vanas nous avons trouv\u00e9 ran et vanas.\n\nMais rathas ne serait-il pas le th\u00e8me primitif de ratha ou du moins un th\u00e8me coexistant avec lui ?

Et puis les mots *p\u00e9thos* en grec, *lithus* en gothique et *ratas* en lithuanien n\u2019appuient-ils point la conjecture d\u2019une forme archa\u00efque *rathas* ou *rathar*? Le parall\u00e9lisme de *vanarpati* a bien aussi sa valeur.\n\nC\u2019est encore de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re qu\u2019il faut expliquer *r\u0101dhaspati*, car \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de *r\u0101dha*, nous trouvons *r\u0101dhas*, comme *ranas* \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de *vana*.

Ce terme r\u00e9siste \u00e0 toute explication, car *rtas* n\u2019est pas un g\u00e9nitif et on ne retrouve aucun vestige d\u2019un th\u00e8me *rtas*.\n\nGrassmann dit bien que *rtaspati* est une contraction de *rasyepati*, mais cette explication est peu satisfaisante.\n\nPour nous, nous ne trouvons pas d\u2019autre interpr\u00e9tation que celle de l\u2019analogie. Mais il restera toujours \u00e0 justifier pourquoi *rtaspati* s\u2019est form\u00e9 par analogie de *ranaspati*, *rathaspati*, etc., plut\u00f4t que sur le mod\u00e8le de *j\u012btapati*, *a\u00e7tapati*, etc.\nART. XXII.\u2014Some Remarks on the Life and Labours of Alexander Csoma de K\u00f6r\u00f6s, delivered on the occasion when his Tibetan Books and MSS. were exhibited before the Royal Asiatic Society on the 16th June, 1884. By Surgeon-Major Theodore Duke, M.D., F.R.C.S., late of the Bengal Army.\n\n\"The dry old stick,\" as we heard at our last meeting, here affectionately designated that great Orientalist, Horace Hayman Wilson, knew Alexander Csoma de K\u00f6r\u00f6s well, and was in frequent correspondence with this Tibetan scholar, when the latter was pursuing his studies at the Buddhist monasteries in Zanskar, particularly at Pukhtar, and afterwards at Kanum in Upper Besarh.\n\nAfter Dr. Wilson's return to England in 1833, and when he had become Secretary to the Royal Asiatic Society, there appeared in the first volume of the Society's Journal, edited under his care, a biographical sketch of the early life and labours of Csoma, which account, even at the present day, is read with much interest by those who devote their attention to Oriental literature.\n\nThis sketch, however, is manifestly incomplete, because Dr. Archibald Campbell, referring to it in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for 1843, at page 823, part ii., made the following remark:\n\n\"The number of the Royal Asiatic Society's Journal containing the sketch, with the author's manuscript corrections, is now in my possession, the corrections having been made by the subject of it before his death.\"\n\nThis corrected copy of the Royal Asiatic Society's Journal, alluded to by Dr. Campbell, is, I regret to say, not available; but I have a copy of the original document written by Csoma, from which that sketch was compiled,\nand this will be found, with many other as yet unpublished papers, in the Biography, which the late Mr. Tr\u00fcbner decided to publish in his Oriental Series.\n\nI have neither time at my command, nor is it my intention to trespass now upon your indulgence, which I should be compelled to do, were I to bring forward all the necessary details, which would throw a sufficient light upon the works of that indefatigable student and successful labourer in the field of a real \"terra incognita,\" as he used to call it. I wish merely to state at present, that the following words, written by Archibald Campbell, in December, 1843, hold good still:\n\n\"Since the death of de K\u00f6r\u00f6s, I have not ceased to hope that some member of the Society (of Bengal) would furnish a connected account of his career in the East. It is now more than a year and a half since we lost him, yet we are without any such record to show, that his labours were valuable to the literary association he so earnestly studied to assist, in its most important objects, as well as to show that his labours have been duly appreciated.\"\n\nNo surprise will therefore be felt that in the absence of a biography based upon trustworthy records, little is known of Csoma to this day. Extraordinary theories have been propounded regarding the real intentions and objects he had in view; his own countrymen especially, I might say, knew least of him, and were led to conceive opinions which, I believe, can be traced originally to some mistaken or misunderstood data of Baron Charles H\u00fcgel. This Austrian nobleman visited Kashmir in 1835. Among other things it was said, that after studying Tibetan \"for nine years,\" Csoma \"at last\" discovered, to his \"great vexation,\" that the language of Tibet was only an inferior dialect of the Sanskrit, or as H\u00fcgel puts it: \"nur eine untergeordnete Sprache.\" These and similar opinions have repeatedly been propounded, and the strange conclusion come to, that Csoma was the victim of philological speculations, and spent his life-long labours in vain.\n\nThis is very plainly expressed in an interesting work recently published by Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner, I mean Ralston's Tibetan Tales.\nBut surmises, as I venture to call them, like the above, can hardly be allowed to stand in connection with Csoma\u2019s fame as a traveller and a man of scientific philology. In the preface to Ralston\u2019s book we meet with certain statements, philological, historical, and geographical, which on close examination will, without doubt, be pronounced mistakes; and although these cannot be detailed here now, yet it seems quite appropriate that, as the Royal Asiatic Society was the first scientific body in Europe which did the honour to Csoma of noticing his early career, any further remarks on the same subject, though almost half a century later, should, with your permission, be made before this Society.\n\nWhen, a good many years ago, I landed in Calcutta, with an appointment from the East India Company, as Assistant-Surgeon in the Bengal Medical Service, I endeavoured to collect all the details I could regarding my learned countryman\u2019s career in the East; Mr. Arthur Grote, then President of the Asiatic Society of Bengal; Babu Rajendral\u00e1la Mitra; the late Dr. Ro\u00ebr and others kindly rendered every assistance in my pursuit. So much was positively known, that Csoma started from Nagy-Enyed, in Transylvania, towards the end of 1819, travelled overland, often on foot, through Wallachia, Bulgaria, afterwards visited the island of Cyprus, and then Egypt. From the shores of Syria, his journey led through B\u00e1ghd\u00e1d, from Latakia to Aleppo, Mosul, Persia, Bokhara, Kulm, across the Bamian pass into Afghanistan. He arrived at Cabul on the 6th of January, 1822. And it was said that Csoma toiled through all this distance, through the parching plains of Central Asia and the snowy mountains of the Hindu Kush and the Himalas, simply in the endeavour of realizing a fanciful idea, namely, that of finding in Asia a nation speaking a dialect akin to his own Magyar tongue.\n\nThis was attributed to him particularly by some of his countrymen, and we find that the same happened recently in the case of Count B\u00e9la Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi when travelling in China; but I need hardly say that Csoma nowhere gave utterance to this chimera. What we find, however, as being the object of his researches, is comprised in these few words of his, taken\nfrom the Preface to the Tibetan Dictionary, where he says that \"he had not been sent by any government to gather political information, neither can he be accounted of the number of those wealthy European gentlemen who travel at their own expense for pleasure or curiosity; but rather that he was only a poor student, very desirous to see the different countries of Asia, the scene of so many memorable transactions of former ages, to observe the manners of several nations and to learn their languages. And such a man was he who, during his peregrinations, depended for his subsistence on the benevolence of others.\" Csoma gratefully acknowledges in that Preface his deep obligations to the British Indian Government, and he mentions by name all those English gentlemen who showed him any kindness on his arduous journey, and publicly expresses respectful thanks to all, for favours conferred upon him.\n\nFrom Cabul, Csoma travelled through Peshawar, Lahore, Umritsir and Jam\u00fa to Kashmir, thence to Leh, towards Yarkand, intending to penetrate into Mongolia by way of North China; but in this endeavour he was prevented.\n\nOn his return journey from Leh towards Srinaggur, he met, accidentally, with William Moorcroft, in the valley of Dras. The two travellers spent five months and six days together, during which, Moorcroft put into Csoma's hands the Alphabetum Tibetanum of Giorgii, and the Hungarian, having found by this means, a vast, yet uncultivated field of Oriental learning, was induced to devote himself to the study of the Tibetan language, and signed an agreement with Moorcroft, by the terms of which, Csoma bound himself to prepare a Dictionary and a Grammar for the Government, and to this task he devoted the best years of his life.\n\nThe details of Csoma's prolonged studies at the various Buddhist monasteries, we shall pass over at present; it will be sufficient to mention here that when, in April, 1831, Csoma arrived in Calcutta, to arrange the result of his labours, much valuable assistance was rendered to him by Horace Hayman Wilson, and after Wilson's departure for Europe by James Prinsep, who, as numerous as yet un-\npublished documents testify, was a most appreciative and sympathizing friend of Csoma.\n\nAfter Prinsep's death Dr. Malan, Professor in Bishop's College, Calcutta, and afterwards Mr. Henry Torrens, succeeded to the office of Secretary of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. Both these names are intimately connected with Csoma's life history.\n\nOn his way to Lassa, for the purpose of obtaining access to the Libraries of the Dalai Lama, he died at Darjiling of Terai fever, on the 11th day of April, 1842; having just completed the 58th year of his age. He bequeathed his all to the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and the substantial tombstone in the Darjiling Cemetery bears an epitaph breathing the spirit of so much affectionate appreciation of Csoma's labours, an appreciation which Englishmen never grudge to bestow on real merit, be the subject of it a countryman or a foreigner.\n\nThis is the text of the epitaph, which can be so well read on the photograph of the tomb:\n\nH. I.\n\nAlexander Csoma de K\u00f6r\u00f6si\n\na native of Hungary\nwho to follow out philological researches\nresorted to the East\nand after years passed under\nprivations such as have been seldom endured\nand patient labour in the cause of Science\ncompiled a Dictionary and Grammar\nof the Tibetan Language\nHis best and real Monuments\nOn his way to H' Lassa\nto resume his labours\nhe died at this place\non the 11th April 1842\naged 44 years\n\nHis fellow labourers the Asiatic Society of Bengal\ninscribe this Tablet to his Memory\n\nRequiescat in Pace.\n\n1 This should be de K\u00f6r\u00f6s, without terminal i.\n2 Csoma was 58 years old at the time of his death.\nNine years after I had left Darjiling, where at one time I was stationed as Civil Surgeon in medical charge of the Sanatorium, I visited Csoma's tomb in February of last year, and to my great surprise found the old structure gone, an entirely new one having been put in its place.\n\nThe cemetery of Darjiling occupies part of the eastern slope of the ridge on the way to Takv\u00e1r, looking towards Nep\u00e1l. The Buddhist monastery, with its large prayer wheel, mentioned by Prof. Monier Williams at our last meeting, is in the Bhotia-busti on the western side of the slope leading towards the Lebong spur.\n\nDuring the heavy rains, two years previous, a landslip occurred, in consequence of which several tombstones suffered damage. The late Lieut.-Governor of Bengal, Sir Ashley Eden, ordered the necessary repairs to be done; and I likewise learnt at Darjiling, from the officers of the Public Works Department, that Csoma's grave had been placed by the authorities on the list of those public monuments, which are for ever to remain under the care of the officers of Government.\n\nAnother act of English generosity towards the Hungarian, more than forty years after his death!\n\nIn Calcutta, through the courtesy of the Council of the Asiatic Society of Bengal and of the Government Secretary, especially of Mr. Durand, assisted by my friend Dr. George King, I was able to secure very valuable data, which at last rendered the completion of Csoma's biography possible. The Royal Academy of Sciences of Hungary testified an especial interest in the work. Apart from Csoma's own original letters, there are those of Mr. Moorcroft, Capt. Kennedy, Dr. Wilson, Mr. McNaughten, Mr. James Prinsep, Dr. Gerard, Dr. Malan, a correspondence with Mr. Brian H. Hodgson, Prince Eszterh\u00e1zy, and others. All of which will be found in detail, in the Biography.\n\nI feel that I owe apologies to the Society, after the long communication they have listened to already, for detaining you so long. But I venture to ask for a few moments more of your indulgence, to enable me to exhibit the valuable gift,\nwhich, in the eyes of Csoma's countrymen, is priceless. This gift, which you see before you, was made by the Reverend Solomon C\u00e6sar Malan, D.D., Oxford, Rector of Broadwindsor, Dorset, who, as we read in the papers, made the munificent donation to Oxford of his entire Oriental Library, consisting of 2000 volumes. Dr. Malan's gift of Csoma's Tibetan Books and Manuscripts, collected by him in the Buddhist Monasteries of Tibet, will, in the future, be treasured up in the Library of the Royal Hungarian Academy of Sciences at Budapest. These books are the original foundations on which the Tibetan Dictionary and Grammar were based. They consist of\n\n24 Prints\n13 MSS. in capital (d'vuchan)\n3 MSS. in small (d'vumed) characters\n\naltogether 40 Pieces.\n\nIn conclusion, I shall add a few lines by way of extracts from Dr. Malan's letters, with which I was favoured on this subject; they throw a most pleasing light on the character of the Tibetan scholar, and on the feelings, full of sympathy, with which he was regarded by the writer of them.\n\nDr. Malan writes:\n\n\"April 5, 1884.\u2014I am about disposing of my library, and I feel sorry to scatter about Csoma's Tibetan Books and Manuscripts, which he gave me in 1839, and which I have used and kept ever since for his sake. But it strikes me that Budapest would be the proper home for these treasures. There are some thirty volumes, and if you think they would be acceptable, and you would undertake to forward them, I will send them to you. . . . .\n\n\"In looking over them, they remind me of him. There was something so kind, so simple, and winning about his manner. But my impression was that he was not duly appreciated.\"\n\n\"April 17.\u2014I shall be delighted to receive a copy of Csoma's life.\n\n\"If by Philology they mean the system now in vogue of\nmaking languages, *one* language out of two or three, or *two* or three languages out of one; then Csoma was no 'philologist,' neither am I, assuredly. But he was far better than that. He was devoted to his one object, was master of several languages, and, over and above all, he has and shall have to the end the honour and credit of being the founder of Tibetan studies in Europe. He did not scrutinize the intricacies of hypotheses; he had too much sense for that. But he laid the foundation, and others only built upon it.\n\n\"The books leave this to-morrow. It has cost me 'a little' to say good-bye to them. But I feel that they ought to rest in your University, where I trust they will be taken care of and valued for dear Csoma's sake.\"\n\nThe catalogue is appended:\u2014\nTIBETAN BOOKS AND MANUSCRIPTS\n\nof the late Alexander Csoma de K\u00f6r\u00f6s.\n\nPresented to the Royal Hungarian Academy of Sciences at Budapest by the Rev.

D\u00e8s l'\u00e2ge de 22 ou 23 ans, il quitta l'Espagne et parcourut une partie du Maroc et la c\u00f4te septentrionale de l'Afrique jusqu'\u00e0 Barqah. Il voyagea en Asie-Mineure et arriva en \u00c9gypte o\u00f9 r\u00e9gnait El Malek el K\u00e2mel, l'ayoubite. Ce prince le prit \u00e0 son service et le nomma chef des herboristes et des m\u00e9decins du Caire. \u00c0 sa mort, Ebn el beytar passa au service d'El 'Adel II, puis d'Es-S\u00e2leh Nadjm ed-d\u00een Ayyoub, qui avait enlev\u00e9 la Syrie \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re. Il mourut en 646 (1248 de J.C.).\n\nEbn el beytar a compos\u00e9 un grand nombre d'ouvrages ; le plus important est celui qui a pour titre *Dj\u00e2me' el moft\u00eed\u00e2t* \"Collection des Simples.\" C'est, suivant les expressions de M. le Dr. Leclerc qui, sous les auspices de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, en aura sous peu achev\u00e9 la traduction, le plus s\u00e9rieux, le plus complet et de beaucoup le plus \u00e9tendu que les Arabes nous aient laiss\u00e9 sur la mati\u00e8re m\u00e9dicale.\n\nQuant au trait\u00e9 des poids et mesures qu'on lui attribue, le lecteur va voir qu'il appartient incontestablement \u00e0 Ez-Zahr\u00e2wy. J'ajouterai que c'est le plus ancien monument arabe de ce genre que nous poss\u00e9dions.\n\n\\(^2\\) Abou'l Q\u00e2sem Khalaf ebn 'Abb\u00e2s Ez-Zahr\u00e2wy naquit \u00e0 Ez-Zahr\u00e2, localit\u00e9 voisine de Cordoue et fond\u00e9e par 'Abd er-Rahman III en l'ann\u00e9e 936 de notre \u00e8re. \"C'\u00e9tait, dit Ebn Ab\u00ee Osaybi'tah, un m\u00e9decin distingu\u00e9, profond\u00e9ment vers\u00e9 dans la botanique et l'histoire naturelle. Parmi les nombreux ouvrages qu'il composa sur les sciences se rattachant \u00e0 sa profession, le plus estim\u00e9 est celui g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement connu sous le titre de *K\u00e9t\u00e2b ez-Zahr\u00e2wy.*\" C'est le m\u00eame m\u00e9decin Arabe si connu durant le moyen \u00e2ge sous les noms d'Abucasis, Bucacis Galaf, Azaragi, etc., et dont les ouvrages furent traduits en latin.

Leclerc, dans la savante notice qu'il consacre \u00e0 ce grand m\u00e9decin (*Hist. de la M\u00e9d. ar.* i. p. 437 et suiv.), regarde comme peu \u00e9loign\u00e9e de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 la date de 404 de l'h\u00e9gire (1013 de J.C.) donn\u00e9e par L\u00e9on l'Africain comme \u00e9tant celle de sa mort.\nchapitre consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019explication des mesures de capacit\u00e9 et des poids qu\u2019on rencontre dans les ouvrages de m\u00e9decine, suivant leurs diff\u00e9rents noms et par ordre alphab\u00e9tique :\n\nIl faut savoir que pour les choses liquides, fondantes, les mesures et les poids varient avec leur pesanteur ; en d\u2019autres termes, la diff\u00e9rence entre l\u2019huile, le vin et le miel est tr\u00e8s grande. En effet, le miel a un poids sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui du vin d\u2019une quantit\u00e9 \u00e9gale aux deux tiers de celui-ci. Le miel p\u00e8se une fois plus autant que l\u2019huile ou un petit peu moins, suivant les diff\u00e9rentes qualit\u00e9s de miel. Le vin est plus lourd que l\u2019huile : cet exc\u00e9dent est \u00e9gal au neuvi\u00e8me du poids de ce dernier liquide. Le vin, le vinaigre et l\u2019eau ont la m\u00eame pesanteur ou \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s, selon leurs vari\u00e9t\u00e9s. Il en est de m\u00eame des mati\u00e8res huileuses (adh\u00e1n) et des corps gras (sann). Exemple : D\u2019apr\u00e8s ce que les anciens ont mentionn\u00e9, soixante-douze ratls d\u2019huile sont la contenance de la jarre d\u2019Antioche ; il faut pour obtenir le m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat un poids de vin de quatre-vingts ratls et, en miel, cent trente-six ratls ou un peu plus, suivant la diff\u00e9rence de qualit\u00e9 du miel, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce qui vient d\u2019\u00eatre dit.\n\nConform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019analogie, le rob\u2019, qui est chez nous une mesure contenant en bl\u00e9 ou autres grains dix meudd et demi, au meudd du Proph\u00e8te, (fol. 1r), que Dieu le b\u00e9nisse et le salue ! sera plein avec seize ratls d\u2019huile de douze\n\n1 Eliy\u00e1 dit $\\frac{3}{4}$ ; c\u2019est aussi, comme on va le voir, la proportion donn\u00e9e par Galien et Dioscoride.\n2 La moiti\u00e9 seulement d\u2019apr\u00e8s le M\u00e9tropolitain de N\u00e9sibe, d\u2019accord avec les deux auteurs pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s.\n3 Eliy\u00e1 et Ez-Zahr\u00e2wy indiquent le m\u00eame rapport entre l\u2019huile et le vin.\n4 D\u2019apr\u00e8s le principe que l\u2019auteur vient de poser, il faudrait, au lieu de $126$ ratls, $133\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{80 + 2 \\times 80}{3}$ ou $144 = 72 \\times 2$. Suivant la proportion fournie par les chiffres qu\u2019il donne plus loin, on aurait $16:30::72:x = 135$.\n5 La jarre d\u2019Antioche para\u00eet avoir la m\u00eame contenance que l\u2019amphore italique, ou le double de l\u2019urna. On lit dans les appendices aux \u0152uvres de Galien (Ed. de Venise, 1650), t. iv, p. 276, Amphora stolica habet (adet) libras 72; (vini) libras 90; (mellis) libras 108 (De mens. humid.).\u2014Do. p. 277.\u2014Amphora habet libras 90 (Diosc., De mens. humid.), vini, p. 277.\u2014Idem est pondus aquae et aceti.

Il s'agirait donc ici du ratl du Ro\u00fbm de 317gr., 808. On aura pour la jarre d'huile d'Antioche, pleine d'huile, \\(72 \\times 317,808 = 22k.\\) 882,176 et pour celle pleine de vin \\(25k.\\) 424,640. Ces chiffres correspondent au *madimi\u00e2n* de Casir\u00ee, No. 839 (Escurial 844). Cf. ci-apr\u00e8s p. 10, note 6, p. 505, note 9, et p. 506, note 1.\n\n\\(^2\\) Les nombres 16 pour l'huile et 18 pour le vin ne sont pas en rapport. Si l'on conserve le premier, il faudra 17\\(^{1/2}\\) seulement; si le chiffre 18 est le bon, on aura pour l'huile 16,2 ratls. El Moqaddasy, g\u00e9ographe du IV\\(^e\\) si\u00e8cle de l'h\u00e9gire, attribue \u00e9galement 18 ratls au *rob*\\(^b\\) de l'Andalos, mais sans nous dire de quel ratl il entend parler ni s'il s'agit de vin. Avec le ratl du Ro\u00fbm de 96 *darakhmy*, on aurait pour le *rob*\\(^b\\) de 18 ratls, \\(6k.\\) 720,644, et corollairement, pour le meudd du Proph\u00e8te, plein de vin ou d'eau, \\(544gr.\\), 813\\(^{1/2}\\). Cette \u00e9valuation ne diff\u00e8re pas sensiblement de celle qui nous est donn\u00e9e par le plus grand nombre d'auteurs musulmans: \\(529gr.\\), 68 ou \\(535,6653\\)\\(^{1/2}\\).\u2014Mar Eliya nous apprend que le ratl du Maghreb se composait de 96 *metq\u00e2ls*, \u00e9gaux \u00e0 \\(137\\)\\(^{1/2}\\) derhams \\(=423gr.\\), 744. En adoptant cette valeur pour le ratl, on aurait alors: jarre d'Antioche, pleine d'huile, \\(=30k.\\) 509,568 et la m\u00eame, pleine de vin, \\(=33k.\\) 899,520.\n\n*Rob*\\(^b\\) de l'Andalos, plein de vin, \\(=7k.\\) 627,392; meudd du Proph\u00e8te, plein de vin \\(=726gr.\\), 418.\n\n\\(^3\\) La diff\u00e9rence est ici de 2 ratls, car \\(18 + \\frac{18 \\times 2}{3} = 30\\) et \\(16 \\times 2 = 32\\). Mais il faut tenir compte de la r\u00e9serve faite par l'auteur et, en effet, le rapport entre l'huile et le miel ne saurait \u00eatre constant, \u00e0 cause des diverses qualit\u00e9s de ce dernier produit.\n\n\\(^4\\) Le derham se composait de 6 d\u00e2neqs, l'est\u00e2r serait de \\(6\\)\\(^{1/2}\\) derhams; telle est une des \u00e9valuations donn\u00e9es par la *Madjmou'ah f't l hez\u00e2b*, Escurial 844, El 'Antary et Jean fils de S\u00e9rapion. Mohammad ibn Isma'il dit dans son commentaire de l'*Ardjouz\u00e2h* d'Avicenne que, pour les lexicologues, l'est\u00e2r est de \\(6\\)\\(^{1/2}\\) derhams.\n\n\\(^5\\) \"Au poids de l'or, lesquels font 6\\(^{1/2}\\) derhams, au poids de l'argent\" ajoute la *Madjmou'ah f't l hez\u00e2b*. Tel est le poids de l'est\u00e2r adopt\u00e9 par le *Q\u00e2miq* et par les ouvrages de jurisprudence, comme repr\u00e9sentant le 20\\(^{me}\\) du ratl de Bagdad de 128\\(^{1/2}\\) derhams (\\(=397gr.\\), 26); il est \u00e9gal \u00e0 19gr., 863. Un autre est\u00e2r, de \\(6\\)\\(^{1/2}\\) derhams (\\(=20gr.\\), 8837), est le 20\\(^{me}\\) du ratl de Bagdad de 130 derhams (401gr., 674).\u2014On lit dans un M.S. ar. de la biblioth\u00e8que de l'Universit\u00e9 de G\u00eanes: Les habitants de l'Orient ont divis\u00e9 aussi leur ratl en vingt est\u00e2r; chaque est\u00e2r est de quatre et demi de leurs metq\u00e2ls.\n\n\\(^6\\) \\(6\\)\\(^{1/2}\\) derhams \\(=\\frac{128}{20}\\). On sait que 128 est le nombre de derhams donn\u00e9 au ratl par les M\u00e2l\u00e9kites. Cf. Maqr\u00eezy, *Poids et mesures*, etc.\nles plus savants m\u00e9decins sont tomb\u00e9s d'accord et ce que l'auteur regarde comme certain, c'est que l'est\u00e2r p\u00e8se quatre metq\u00e2ls.\n\n**Eb\u00fblq** \u0627\u0628\u06cc\u0644\u06a9, aigu\u00e8re.

D'autres disent que l'obole p\u00e8se quatre q\u00eerats et d'autres, dix habbah.\n\n**Ebnous** \u0627\u0628\u0646\u0648\u0633.

Cependant comme la Madjmo\u00e9ah ft l'h\u00e9rib donne cette m\u00eame capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ebriq, il est probable qu'il faut entendre le ratl de Bagdad.

C'est \u00e9galement une\n\n1 BB aghr\u0101yd.\n\n2 Ez-Zahr\u0101wy est le seul \u00e0 donner 11 derhams kayl \u00e0 l'once ; peut-\u00eatre faut-il voir l\u00e0 une erreur de copiste ou l'omission d'une fraction.\n\n3 Les metq\u00e2ls de l'argent me paraissent \u00eatre des darakhmy ; d'o\u00f9 cette once = 26gr., 484 ; c'est l'once du Ro\u00fbm.\n\nOn lit dans les appendices aux \u0152uvres du Galien, iv. p. 275 et 276 : Uncia drachmas 8 qua et Holoa dicuntur.\u2014Uncia apud Atticos continet drachmas 7. Apud Italos drachmas 8 (De pond. et mens.).\u2014Uncia habet drachmas 8. Scrupulos 24... Vocatur et alio nomine Tetrasarum Italicon, id est Quattuordecim Italicus (Ex libri Cleop., De pond. et mens.).\u2014Uncia habet drachmas 8 (Alien de eisdem).\u2014Uncia habet drachmas 8 (alias 7\u00bd) (De mens. et pond. veterin.).\u2014Uncia habet drachmas 8. Scrupulos 24 (Diosc., De pond.).\n\n4 Les 7\u00bd metq\u00e2ls de 4gr., 414 = 33gr., 105 et repr\u00e9sentent l'once du ratl de Bagdad de 128\u00bd derhams de 3gr., 0898. On remarquera que cette once = 10 darakhmy et aussi qu'une le\u00e7on du M.S. de Galien porte 7\u00bd. Il est \u00e9videmment question dans tout ce passage de deuxonces diff\u00e9rentes, l'une de 26gr., 484 (ou l'once du Ro\u00fbm), et l'autre de 33gr., 105 (ou l'once du petit ratl de Bagdad).\n\n5 4,414 = 2,942. Ce poids se rapproche de celui de nombre de monnaies d'argent ; mais pourquoi l'auteur le d\u00e9signe-t-il sous celui de derham kayl, r\u00e9serv\u00e9 au derham-poids ? En ajoutant la fraction \u00bd aux 11 derhams kayl ci-dessus, on aurait 2gr., 942\u00d711\u00bd = 33,105 ou, comme on l'a vu, l'once du ratl de Bagdad de 128\u00bd.\n\n6 Nous avons trouv\u00e9 pour le derham dokhl 2gr., 207 ; les 2 font par cons\u00e9quent 4,414 ; mais les 3 habbah semblent de trop. Comp. cependant ci-apr\u00e8s, n. 4, p. 521.\n\n7 Le texte porte b\u00ea'l kayl \"\u00e0 la mesure.\" Il faut se rappeler que, chez les Romains, la livre de mesure, mensuralis, se composait de 12 onces et que 9 onces de mesure correspondaient \u00e0 7\u00bd onces pond\u00e9rales ou de vin ou d'eau (cf. V. Quelpo, Syst. m\u00e8tr. de anc. populus, t. i. p. 508, et suiv.). Ce passage d'Ez-Zahr\u0101wy prouverait que l'once m\u00e9trique se subdivisait elle-m\u00eame en 12 metq\u00e2ls ou drachmes et que 9 drachmes m\u00e9triques r\u00e9pondaient \u00e0 7\u00bd drachmes pond\u00e9rales.\n\n8 Il est difficile de d\u00e9terminer la vraie le\u00e7on. Si Ez-Zahr\u0101wy \u00e9crit Ab\u0101n, on trouve Ay\u0101n dans l'\u00e9dition romaine du Canon d'Avicenne et An\u0101b dans les MSS. du Menh\u0101dj ed-deukk\u0101n.\n\n9 Le Menh\u0101dj ed-deukk\u0101n porte \"2 mana pour le miel et 1 seul mann pour l'huile.\" Suivant Jean fils de S\u00e9rapion (Canon d'Avicenne), l'ay\u0101n (sic) de l'huile p\u00e8se 1\u00bd mann et celui du miel, 2\u00bd ratls ; il y a \u00e9videmment une erreur.\n\n10 BB.\n\n11 BB. En changeant le \u062b, le \u0646 ou le \u0641 en \u0628, on aura qui est la transcription exacte du grec \u1f00\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2, \u00e9gal \u00e0 un cyathe et\nmesure (kayl) et un poids (wazn). Sa mesure est de huit darahma (sic), c'est-\u00e0-dire metq\u00e2ls, et son poids, de dix-huit qir\u00e2ts. D'apr\u00e8s quelques-uns, c'est treize derhams et, d'apr\u00e8s d'autres, douze derhams kayl. D'autres disent que sa mesure est un qu\u00e2\u1e6d\u00fbs (cyathe) et demi et le qu\u00e2\u1e6d\u00fbs, une once et demie.\n\nOlostour. Il est \u00e9gal \u00e0 deux darakhmy et demie.\n\nAstarioun. C'est un metq\u00e2l de m\u00eame que la darakhmy et aussi l'oligy.\n\nAstoan. On lit dans quelques ouvrages astar'\u00e2loun. C'est un demi-qest.\n\nDans un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent travail, je proposais de lire astar'\u00e2loun, mot qui me semblait la transcription d'acetabulum. Quoique ces deux mesures, l'une grecque, l'autre romaine, soient les m\u00eames, c'est aux Grecs que les Arabes ont emprunt\u00e9 le nom qu'ils ont adopt\u00e9. C'est d'ailleurs dans les ouvrages des m\u00e9decins grecs qu'ils ont puis\u00e9, en les traduisant, leurs premi\u00e8res connaissances m\u00e9dicales.\n\n1 Quoiqu'Ex-Zahr\u00e2wy, sous le mot Kasv\u00e2nd, qui n'est que la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de \u0643\u0633\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f, abr\u00e9g\u00e9 par suite d'une erreur de copiste, erreur que notre grand m\u00e9decin s'est born\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9ter, attribue de nouveau 18 qir\u00e2ts \u00e0 l'oxybaphe-poids, c'est-\u00e0-dire 1 darakhmy, le texte est \u00e9videmment erron\u00e9. Escorial 844 (839 de Cassi) nous apprend que l'oxybaphe contient 18 darakhmy d'huile, 2 onces et 4 darakhmy de vin et 3\u00bd onces de miel : ce qui concorde avec les App. de Galien :\n\nAcetabulum habet (olai) drachmas 18 ; (vinii) unc. 2, scrup. 12 ; (melis) uncias 3, scrup. 9 (De mens. humid.). On sait que la drachme se composait de 3 scrupules.\n\nAcetabulum habet (olai) drachmas 18 ; (vinii) drach. 20 ; (melis) uncas 3, drach. 3 (De mens. humid.). \u2014 Acetabulum (melis) habet uncias 3, drachmas que 3 (alias 2) (Diosc., melis). \u2014 On voit que la le\u00e7on qui donne 2, est mauvaise. \u2014 Acetabulum, id est quarta pars cotyle, aquat uncias 2\u00bd (ou 20 darakhmy) (Diosc., De mens hum., vini).\n\nOn lit aussi dans le Canon d'Avicenne (\u00e9d. de Rome) sous le nom d'Ex-S\u00e2her (Youssef el Qasa, qui vivait du temps du Khalife Abb\u00e2side El Moktafy b\u00e2d, premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es du Xe si\u00e8cle de notre \u00e8re): \" l'Ekonominon (sic) d'huile p\u00e8se 16 (lines 18) darakhmy ; celui de vin, 2 onces et \u00bc darakhmy (lisez 4 darakhmy), et celui de miel, 3 onces et \u00be d'once. \u2014 Jean fils de S\u00e9rapion (Canon) dit aussi 18 darakhmy.\n\nDans les livres de Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre et dans Dioscoride, l'ac\u00e9tabule, dont la mesure \u00e9gale le quart de la cotyle ou un cyathe et demi, p\u00e8se 15 drachmes. Faut-il croire que cette drachme \u00e9tait \u00e9gale au metq\u00e2l de 4,414? 4,414 x 15 = 66,2105 x 20. Il s'agit ici de l'ac\u00e9tabule de vin.

Le Majm\u00fb'ah al 'Ishb\u00ee emploie, en parlant des diverses baq\u00e9l\u00e2h, derham au lieu de metq\u00e2l ; ce qui confirme qu'il s'agit bien ici de la darakhmy (=3gr., 3105).

L\u2019illustre m\u00e9trologue espagnol ajoute que \u201cle conge pesait 10 livres et contenait 6 sextaires et le quadrant\u00e2l, 48,\u201d ce qui est conforme aux \u00e9valuations de nos auteurs arabes.

Ces 480 derhams repr\u00e9sentent bien 3\u00bc ratls de 128 derhams ou Mulekt\u00eees.

El \u2018Antary apud Esc. 844 attribue \u00e9galement 8 onces au qest d\u2019An\u00e2diyah.\nque le grand qest comprend quatre ratls, au (ratl) de l\u2019Ir\u00e2q, et, dit-on, trois ratls, et le petit, un double q\u00fbtouly. Le double q\u00fbtouly \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 deux ratls, \u00e0 la mesure, et \u00e0 un ratl et deux tiers, au poids. Le qest d\u2019Antioche est \u00e9gal \u00e0 un ratl et, en poids, \u00e0 dix-huit onces. Il est de vingt-quatre onces chez les droguistes. Quant au qest (servant) \u00e0 mesurer les liquides, celui de l\u2019huile contient dix-huit onces ; celui du vin, vingt onces, et le qest du miel, trente-six onces.\n\nQoutouly, cotyle.

Sextarius habet (olei) uncias 18 ; (rini) uncias 20 ; (melis) uncias 27 (Galen, De mens. humid. iv. 275 et 277).

Thence he was transferred to Meerut, and held, subsequently, appointments at Bulandsbahr and Rohtak. During this portion of his life he suffered much from ill health, and was compelled to pass many months in the Hills. But this enforced absence from duty was not one of idleness, as it enabled him to explore a wide extent of the Him\u00e1layas, then but little known to English travellers.\n\nOn the annexation of the Panjab, Sir E. Clive Bayley was one of the officers selected by Lord Dalhousie, for the post of Deputy Commissioner, in these newly acquired districts, and, entering on his duties in Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t, in April, 1849, had an opportunity of exhibiting that earnest regard for the welfare of the people among whom he was placed, which\nwas a marked characteristic of his career in India. Thus, observing that one of the chief industries of the country, the manufacture of arms in steel inlaid with gold, would be wholly destroyed, owing to the necessary prohibitions of the Government, in the then disturbed state of the country\u2014and that, from this cause, a large portion of the population were out of employment and in distress\u2014he, at once, encouraged the people to apply their artistic skill to the making of ornaments, boxes, and other useful articles, at the same time, procuring large orders for such objects from England and from different parts of India. Thus it was that native skill\u2014the outcome of long practice\u2014was not lost, and a new and beautiful art created, which still flourishes extensively in this part of India.\n\nIn November, 1849, he was appointed Under-Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, and held this post for two years. His friend, Sir Henry Elliot, was at that time Foreign Secretary, and the two friends were wont to devote many leisure hours to those historical researches which were afterwards embodied in \"The History of India as told by its own Historians.\" Of this valuable work, Sir H. Elliot, as is well known, was only able to print the first volume\u2014the \"Bibliographical Index to the Historians of Muhammadan India,\" Calc. 1850. Eight more volumes have been since issued, under the editorship of Prof. Dowson, between 1867 and 1877. The ninth volume had been entrusted to Sir E. Clive Bayley (whose assistance in his researches Sir H. Elliot had always fully acknowledged); and this is, we hear, nearly, if not quite, ready for the press. In working out the details of this volume, Sir Clive was in constant correspondence with friends in India as well as in England, so that all its details might be set forth as efficiently as possible.\n\nIn November, 1851, Sir E. C. Bayley became Deputy Commissioner of the Kangra District of the Panjab, then\nbut recently under British rule; but, from the state of his health, was compelled, after two years and a half, to take furlough to England in April, 1854. During his residence in England he employed his time in the study of Law, and was called to the Bar in 1857.\n\nShortly after the breaking out of the Mutiny, he returned to India, and was ordered, in Sept. 1857, to Allahabad, where he acted as one of the Under-Secretaries in Sir John Peter Grant's Provisional Government, before the regular establishment of the Official Government of the N.W. Provinces, and, for the following eighteen months, held various appointments in that city. Leaving Lucknow, he was appointed Magistrate at Allahabad, and while he was in this position he entirely designed a beautiful building for the accommodation of the natives, while waiting for cases on trial before the Courts there; as previously, they had no place of shelter. For this building, he had the use of money, derived from the sale of arms, etc., bought in, owing to the Arms Act, under which great quantities of weapons were broken up and sold. His design was in the best style of the old Muhammadan buildings at Dehli and Agra, and for it he made all the plans and measurements himself. His ideas were carried into execution, during the two following years, by his friend and successor, Mr. W. Johnson, and two slabs were inserted in the building to commemorate alike its erection and its designer. So perfect, indeed, is its workmanship, that, some years hence, it will probably be quoted as a fine specimen of the art of one of the Muhammadan Rulers! In April, 1859, he was appointed Judge in the Futtehghurh District, and, shortly afterwards, went to Lucknow as Judicial Commissioner, in the absence of Mr. (now Sir George) Campbell. Subsequently, after a brief residence as Judge, at Agra, he was summoned to Calcutta by Lord Canning, in May, 1861, to act as Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, pending the arrival of Sir Henry Durand, and, after a brief em-\nployment on other duties, became Home Secretary in March, 1862, a post involving much arduous labour, which he held for the following ten years, when he was selected by Lord Northbrook to fill a temporary vacancy in his Council. In the following year, 1873, he was appointed by the Duke of Argyll to be an ordinary member of the Supreme Council, a post he retained till he finally retired in April, 1878, after thirty-six years in the Government service. During his long life in India Sir E. Clive Bayley was the devoted friend of the natives, and, in all the different posts he held, their welfare was his chief object. Many were the native gentlemen with whom he had formed sincere and lasting friendships; and one enduring regret he had in leaving India was, that it deprived him of a mutual intercourse, which they and he alike equally appreciated. During the hours not demanded of him for official work, he had studied deeply the history of the people, their traditions, their literature, their arts, and their archaeology;\u2014and, while collecting a valuable cabinet of Coins, illustrative of many branches of Indian Numismatics, he had become one of the chief authorities for the Numismatic history of India.\n\nHe was created K.C.S.I. on January 1, 1877.\n\nOf the zeal with which he followed up his favourite pursuit of Numismatics, the accompanying list of papers published by him, at various dates, is a sufficient evidence: possibly there may yet be others which have escaped our notice.\n\nThus, in the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society, are printed the following notices of Coins or Antiquities:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 Note on some Sculptures found in the district of Peshawar. Vol. xxi. 1853, p. 606.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 Note on two Inscriptions at Khunniara in the Kangra District. Vol. xxiii. 1854, p. 57.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 Notes on Babu Rajendralala Mitra\u2019s translation of a Bactrian Inscription from Wardak in Afghanistan. Vol. xxx. 1861, p. 347.\nRemarks on Babu Rajendralala's interpretation of some Bactro-Buddhist Relics from Rawal Pindi. Vol. xxxi. 1862, p. 184.\n\nMemorandum on and tentative reading of the S\u00fae Vih\u00e1r Inscription from near Bh\u00e1walp\u00far. Vol. xxxix. 1870, p. 65.\n\nNote on two Coins from Kausambhi.

Thomas's letter, \"On the Derivation of Arian Alphabets.\" Vol. xxxvi. 1867, p. 43.\n\nDo. on a Coin of Ghiy\u00e1s-ud-din A'zam Sh\u00e1h. Vol. xliii. 1874, p. 156.\n\nOn Sculptures discovered by Gen. Cunningham at Bharhut. Vol. xliv. 1875, p. 44.\n\nDo. on Rajendralala Mitra's account of a Copper Plate Inscription of the time of Skanda Gupta. Ibid. p. 45.\n\nDo. on an Inscribed Stone obtained by Capt. R. Beavan in the Chandra District. Ibid. p. 62.\n\nDo. on a paper by the Rev. K. M. Banerjea, \"On Human Sacrifices in Ancient India.\" Vol. xlv. 1876, p. 55.\n\nTo the Journal of this Society he contributed two papers \"On the Genealogy of Modern Numerals,\" the first, published in Vol. XIV. 1882, p. 335; the second, in Vol. XV. 1883, p. 1. The third and concluding paper on this subject was in preparation, but cannot, we fear, now be printed.\n\nTo the Numismatic Chronicle he contributed \"Remarks on certain Dates occurring on the Coins of the Hind\u00fa Kings of K\u00e1b\u00fal, expressed in the Gupta era, and in Arabic or Quasi-Arabic Numerals,\" 3rd series, 1882, vol. ii. p. 129; with a \"Postscript\" to same paper, ibid. p. 291.\nSir E. Clive Bayley was five times President of the Bengal Asiatic Society, and for three years, since his return to England, Vice-President of this Society. He was, also, appointed by Lord Mayo Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta, and held that office for five years.\n\nMr. E. B. Eastwick, M.A., C.B., F.R.S., etc., who died at Ventnor, July 16, 1883, was born in 1814 and received his earliest education at the Charter House, where he was in the First Form with the present Dean of Christ Church, and with Dr. Elder, the late Head Master of that Scholastic Institution.\n\nIn 1832, he competed for the Scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford, and, though unsuccessful, remained there as a Commoner till he obtained a Postmastership at Merton in the next year, after having been second for the Lusby Scholarship at Magdalen Hall. He was not, however, destined to complete an University career, so brilliantly commenced, as, having received an Indian appointment, he left Oxford, and arrived at Bombay, as a Cadet of Infantry, on June 5, 1836. During the next few years he distinguished himself highly, by his aptitude in acquiring the chief languages spoken in the Presidency of Bombay. Thus, he passed as Interpreter, successively, in Hindust\u00e1ni, Hindi, Mar\u00e1thi, Persian, Gujar\u00e1ti and Kana-rese, between 1837 and 1842, and thus secured appointments which were but the just recognition of his linguistic abilities. During this period, too, he acted as Assistant Political Agent in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1d and in Upper Sind, at the latter place having charge of the Shikarpur Treasury, and of many hundred of Baluchi prisoners; he, also, during the same period, drew up a report on the revenues of Khairpur (for which see Sind Blue Book, pp. 279\u2013293). Having joined Sir Henry Pottinger at Nankin in 1842, he had the opportunity of bringing thence a letter from Sir H. Pottinger to Lord Ellenborough (then Governor-General of India) with the news of the Peace with the Chinese Government.\nDuring these years, too, he did good literary work, including a translation of Hisar-i-Sanjur, or History of the Arrival of the Parsis in India, and of the \"Zartusht Namah\" or life of Zoroaster (which was published in the late Dr. John Wilson's \"Parsi Religion\"); a Sindi Vocabulary, which was lithographed by the Bombay Government and, subsequently, reprinted in the Transactions of the Bengal Asiatic Society, with other papers in the Bombay Journal.\n\nTowards the end of 1843, failing health compelled him to return to Europe, where, taking up his residence at Frankfort, he so rapidly acquired a thorough knowledge of the German language, that he was able to translate Schiller's \"Revolt of the Netherlands\" (Frankfort, 1844, republished in Bohn's Standard Library in 1846), and Prof. Bopp's \"Comparative Grammar of the Indo-Germanic Family of Languages\" in 3 vols. (Frankfort, 1845), a second edition of which was called for in February, 1854.\n\nOn his return to England, Mr. Eastwick was appointed, in 1845, Professor of Urdu in the East India College at Haileybury, and, five years later, its Librarian. During his residence at Haileybury he published a Hindustani Grammar, 1847 (with a 2nd edition in 1854); \"Dry Leaves from Young Egypt\" (1849, 2nd and 3rd editions in 1850 and 1851); a new edition of the Gulistan, with a vocabulary of the Persian text (1849); an edition (with vocabulary of the Hindi Text) of the Prem Sagar and a translation of the same (1851); a memoir of Pir Ibrahim Khan and a translation of the Bagh-o-Bahar (1852): in the same year, also, a translation in prose and verse of the Gulistan; and a catalogue of the Ouseley MSS. in the Bodleian Library. These works were followed by several others, which demonstrate, in a remarkable manner, the wide and varied reading of Mr. Eastwick.\n\nThus, we find among these, a translation of the Anvar-i-Suhaili (1854), which was highly praised by M. Garcin de\nTassy, himself no mean judge of such performances; an Autobiography of Lutfullah, which was translated into French and German and subsequently republished in Tauchnitz\u2019s \u201cStandard Authors\u201d; an edition of the Book of Genesis (for the Bible Society) in the Dekhani Dialect (1858), with articles in the eighth edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica on the N.W. Provinces, Oudh, Persia, Panjab, Sind, etc., together with the first edition of Mr. Murray\u2019s Handbook for the Madras and Bombay Presidencies.\n\nIn 1859 Mr. Eastwick was for some time Assistant Secretary in the Secret Department of the India Office, and, in the commencement of the following year, held a similar post in the Political Department.\n\nIn May, 1860, Mr. Eastwick was appointed Secretary of Her Majesty\u2019s Legation in Persia, where he remained for about three years. What he did and what he saw during this period is pleasantly told in his \u201cJournal of a Diplomate,\u201d published in 2 vols. in 1864. We can only notice here the chief ministerial work in which he was engaged during this period; but this will show that this distinguished Oriental scholar was also an excellent man of business, whenever the occasion called for the exercise of business talents. Thus, in March, 1861, he undertook and successfully accomplished a special mission to the Caspian provinces, drawing up on this occasion a report \u201cOn the Commerce of Persia\u201d (see \u201cReports of Her Majesty\u2019s Secretaries of Embassy and Legation\u201d); and, at the same time, taking on himself the additional duties of the Consulate and Translator\u2019s Office at Tebr\u00e2n. In the autumn of 1862, he proceeded on a special mission to Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, and drew up, on his return thence, a very interesting Trade Report. Subsequently, he was, for a brief period (Dec. 9, 1862, to Jan. 23, 1863), Her Majesty\u2019s Charg\u00e9-d\u2019Affaires at the Persian Court.\n\nIt should be remembered that, while holding this position, it was Mr. Eastwick\u2019s good fortune to complete (mainly by his\npersonal influence with the Persian monarch) the Treaty by which the Persian Government undertook to construct a line of telegraph from the Persian frontier near Baghdad to India, at its own expense, but under the control of English officers (see Correspondence presented to the House of Commons, Feb., 1864). Negotiations had been carried on, but without result, by the late Mr. Alison, for a considerable period: the concession was ultimately accorded freely to Mr. Eastwick by the Sh\u00e1h, as a mark of his goodwill. Mr. Eastwick had good right to be proud of a success, to the value of which the congratulatory letters of Colonels Kemball and Stewart, who were fully acquainted with all the details of this matter, bore ample testimony. Lastly, he obtained from the Persian Government the settlement of the case of Mir Ali Naki Kh\u00e1n, which had been eight years pending. For his services in Persia he was created C.B.\n\nOn his return to England, in 1864, he was appointed the Commissioner for settling a loan to the Government of Venezuela, and, subsequently, wrote, at the request of Mr. Charles Dickens, \"Sketches of Life in a South American Republic,\" for All the Year Round, 1865-6, papers deemed so interesting that they were republished in a separate volume in 1867 and 1868.\n\nIn July, 1866, the Secretary of State for India, Lord Cranborne (now Lord Salisbury), nominated Mr. Eastwick his Private Secretary, and, in 1868, he was elected as the Conservative Member for the Boroughs of Penryn and Falmouth, a seat he retained till 1874. In 1875, the University of Oxford conferred on him the degree of M.A., \"as a slight recognition of distinguished services.\"\n\nIn 1878 he published the first volume of the \"Kaisarnamah-i-Hind,\" the \"Lay of the Empress,\" the dedication of which to herself Her Majesty the Queen was graciously pleased to order, and, towards the close of 1882, he was able to bring out the second volume of this magnificent work.\nWith the exception of the preparation and publication of the \"Kaisar-namah-i-Hind,\" the later years of Mr. Eastwick's laborious life were almost wholly occupied with journeys to India (and it is simply marvellous to those who had the privilege of knowing him that, with such infirmities, he could accomplish what he did), his principal object being to complete the Handbooks to the different Provinces of India which he had commenced many years before. Thus, in 1875, Mr. Eastwick went to India, and, staying there during the visit of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, was able to contribute many interesting articles to the Standard, descriptive of the Prince's visit to the \"Towers of Silence\" near Bombay and to other remarkable sites. On his return to England, he wrote the Handbook to Madras (which did not, however, appear till 1878). The spring and early summer of 1877 found him again in India, collecting notes for the Handbook of Bombay, which was published in 1880, and was succeeded by that of Bengal in 1881. Those for the Panjab and Kashmir were not finished till April, 1883. His last journey to India was in November, 1880, on which occasion he visited Burma, Calcutta, Darjeeling, the Kangra valley and many other places. Subsequently to this, his health completely broke down, and though, at intervals of comparative rest from acute pain, his insatiable longing to visit new places revived, he was compelled to give up much he would gladly have accomplished. He died full of well-deserved honours, a Fellow of the Royal Society for thirty-two years, a F.S.A., and a member of many learned Societies abroad as well as in England.\n\nMr. Thomas Chenery was born in Barbadoes in 1826, and, in early youth, made many voyages between the West Indies, where his parents lived, and this country, these, no doubt, having the effect of inspiring him with the love of travel he cherished so dearly till the last. He spent his school-days at Eton, and thence proceeded to Caius College, Cambridge.\nAt the conclusion of his University career, he was called to the bar; but, shortly after this, entered the service of the *Times* (with which paper the whole of his subsequent life was bound up) as its Correspondent at Constantinople, remaining at that capital for some years. The period when he lived at Constantinople was that of the stormy diplomatic period preceding the Crimean War, and, under the late Lord Stratford de Redcliffe and Lord Strangford, he bore his full share in the severe struggles then maintained by England against the representatives of Russia and of other European Powers. But his residence at Constantinople led to another result, fostered as this doubtless was, to a great extent, by his intimacy with Lord Strangford, viz. his taking up, with enthusiastic zeal, the study of those Eastern languages with which, at Constantinople, he was the most directly thrown in contact.\n\nIt is well known that Mr. Chenery lived much with the leaders of the Greek community at Constantinople, his acquisition of their native tongue giving him an especial interest alike in Modern Romaic and in Classical Greek. The task of correspondent of the *Times* was, at that period, no light one, and, on more than one occasion, Mr. Chenery went up to the front in the Crimea, to relieve Dr. W. H. Russell, at that time the Special Correspondent of the *Times* at the seat of war.\n\nAt the close of the war, Mr. Chenery returned to England, and was regularly employed on the staff of the *Times* as a contributor of Leading Articles, Reviews, and Original Papers; his extensive knowledge of European Politics rendering his services of peculiar value to that Journal.\n\nBut, though strictly devoting himself to the business of the office to which he was attached, Mr. Chenery found time to pursue, and very effectively, his earlier Oriental studies. Indeed, for philological studies he seems to have had a special aptitude\u2014the ordinary languages of Europe,\nFrench, German and Italian, he spoke with ease; he was a master in Romaic and Turkish, and of Arabic and Hebrew he had an excellent knowledge. In the latter language, he was able to converse freely; indeed, he once wrote an introduction in Hebrew to one of his philological works, an edition of the Machberoth Ithiel, a Hebrew work written in imitation of the \"Assemblies of Hariri.\"\n\nWhen the company for the Revision of the Old Testament was formed, Mr. Chenery naturally became a member of it, and devoted much time and thought to this work, not only before he became Editor of the Times, but even subsequently, as a welcome relaxation from more weighty duties. In 1867, he published a translation, with learned notes, historical as well as grammatical, of the \"Assemblies of Hariri,\" which, in the judgment of two such competent men as the late Professor Bernays of Bonn and M. Renan, placed him, at once, in the first rank of Arabic scholars. Hence, naturally, when, in 1868, the Lord Almoner's Professorship of Arabic at Oxford became vacant by the death of Dr. Macbride, the Bishop of Oxford (Wilberforce), then Lord Almoner, offered this almost honorary post to Mr. Chenery, who, in his inaugural lecture, Dec. 3, 1868, gave a masterly account of the Arabic language in its historical and philological relations. This lecture was shortly afterwards published. In 1869, Mr. Chenery printed a pamphlet entitled \"Suggestions for a Railway Route to India,\" a paper which shows a remarkable knowledge of contemporary politics and practical affairs, treated with a scholar's historical acquaintance of the conditions of Oriental life.\n\nMr. Chenery retained his Professorship at Oxford, till, in 1877, on the failure of Mr. Delane's health, he was appointed the Editor of the Times. From this time forward, he could snatch but few minutes for his loved Oriental studies, yet, when he could, he did so. Many will remember his\ncheerful happy appearance at the Congress of Orientalists at Leyden, in September, 1883.\n\nIn this Society, he filled for some years, the office of its Honorary Secretary.\n\nMr. Chenery's health had been long failing; but his actual death, which took place on Monday morning, February 11, was scarcely anticipated even by those who knew him best; indeed, till within ten days of this event, he was hard at work as usual, in his official post.\n\nMr. William Spottiswoode was born in London on January 11, 1825, and educated at Eton and at Harrow, at which latter place he obtained the Lyon Scholarship. In 1842 he went to Balliol College, Oxford, and, in 1845, obtained a First-Class in Mathematics, and, shortly afterwards the Senior Mathematical Scholarship. On leaving Oxford, he took his father's place in the well-known firm of Eyre and Spottiswoode, the Queen's Printers, and, in spite of a lifelong devotion to the highest branches of mathematical and physical science, continued till his last illness an energetic man of business. Mr. Spottiswoode's earliest Mathematical Essays were published in 1847, in five quarto pamphlets, under the title of \"Meditationes Analyticae.\" The dedicatory note attached to them is remarkable; its words are: \"To those who love to wander on the shore till the day when their eyes shall be opened and they shall see clearly the works of God in the unfathomed Ocean of Truth, these papers are inscribed.\" It is not difficult to detect in these early efforts the germs of many of his subsequent investigations. In 1851 appeared his \"Elementary Theorems relating to Determinants,\" a work which so greatly increased his reputation, that he entirely rewrote it previously to its being printed as an elaborate memoir in Crelle's Journal, vol. li., Berlin, 1856. The subject was one familiar to more advanced mathematicians, but, at the time he drew up this essay, there was no elementary work on the subject: his work\nwas, therefore, of the highest value to younger students of algebra, comprising as it did a collection of interesting Theorems, in a comparatively easy form.\n\nWhile not in the least neglecting his mathematical studies, Mr. Spottiswoode paid special attention to the Polarization of Light, and, also, devoted much time to a profound study of Electricity, in the furtherance of which he expended large sums in the collection and construction of appropriate instruments. His gigantic \"induction coil\" furnished him with matter for several papers before the Royal Society and for lectures at the Royal Institution. Indeed, almost the last time he appeared in public was when, on May 24, 1883, he took the chair at the Society of Arts, on which evening Mr. J. E. Gordon read a paper \"On Electric Lighting.\"\n\nIt would be out of place here to attempt to give even a tolerably complete account of the many valuable scientific papers Mr. Spottiswoode wrote\u2014indeed this was very fully done a little while before his untimely death by a writer in \"Nature,\" April 26, 1883; most, too, of the more important of them will be found in the Philosophical Transactions. It will not, however, be forgotten by Eastern scholars that Mr. Spottiswoode contributed two papers to the Journal of this Society, the first in vol. xvii. p. 221 (1860), \"On the supposed discovery of the principle of the Differential Calculus by an Indian Astronomer;\" the second, in vol. xx. p. 345, \"On the Surya Siddhanta and the Hindu Method of Calculating Eclipses.\" In the first, while giving full credit for the acumen of Bhaskaracharya, the eminent astronomer of Ujjain in the twelfth century A.D., he shows clearly that the theories propounded by the Indian mathematician have nothing to do with the Differential Calculus, indeed do not even allude to one of its most essential features, the infinitesimal magnitudes of the intervals of time and space therein employed. In his second paper, Mr. Spottiswoode has attempted, and\nsuccessfully, to translate into modern mathematical language and formulate the rules of the ancient Indian treatise. He further showed that the Hindus, from such observations as they were able to make, had deduced fairly accurate values for the mean motion of the sun, moon, and planets, though on the assumption that the earth was stationary; the details, however, of Mr. Spottiswoode's curious paper are too technical to be quoted here. It may be added, that, besides his remarkable scientific knowledge, Mr. Spottiswoode had a great facility in the acquisition of languages, and was, in early life, well acquainted with some of those of the Caucasus.\n\nMr. Nicholas Tr\u00fcbner, who died suddenly on Sunday, March 30, 1884, was born at Heidelberg in 1817, and, after having distinguished himself by unusual ability in his native town, was apprenticed to M. Mohr, then a leading publisher in that place. Thence he joined the house of Van den Hoek and Ruprecht at G\u00f6ttingen, somewhat later, that of Hoffmann and Campe at Hamburg, and, later still, that of Willmann of Frankfort.\n\nWhile with the latter firm he made, in 1843, the acquaintance of Mr. William Longman, then the youngest and most energetic member of the firm of Longman & Co., to whom, he was for the following nine years an invaluable aid, from the masterly knowledge he had acquired of the then literary resources of the continent and, especially, of Germany. In 1852, mainly with the help of the late Mr. Nutt, he was able to establish himself in Paternoster Row, whence, about ten years since, he moved to Ludgate Hill, which, it is not too much to say, has been, from that time, the centre of a class of literary work not dreamt of, still less found, in any other city in the world.\n\nOf the general work he did as a publisher, it would be out of place to speak here, but there are some matters that deserve especial attention, connected as they are directly with the objects of this Society. These are, his publication in a\nnew and costly form of Marsden's \"Numismata Orientalia,\" on the novel principle of giving to separate scholars, each one the most distinguished in his own special subject, the compilation of the individual essays, under the general editorship of Mr. Edward Thomas, unquestionably the fittest person, from his wide numismatic knowledge, for such a task. Of this important work two volumes and a portion of the third have been now issued, and, though necessarily one that cannot be hurried through the press, we believe its progress and completion are assured; but, complete or incomplete, every scholar will acknowledge its value, and that what has been accomplished is largely due to the energy and individual liberality of the late Mr. Tr\u00fcbner. Another and most important work Mr. Tr\u00fcbner inaugurated was his \"Oriental Series,\" comprising now 46 volumes, which has given the opportunity to a varied selection of scholars of publishing many valuable works, which, but for his aid, would most likely never have seen the light of day. Nor can we omit to mention his \"American and Oriental Record,\" first started in 1869, which, coming out with tolerable regularity, though at no fixed period, affords a concise and useful notice of a considerable mass of mixed literature, with occasionally well-executed biographical sketches of scholars who have recently passed away. It may be added that, early in his career, Mr. Tr\u00fcbner took great interest in the progress of literature in the New World, drawing up and publishing a \"Bibliographical Guide to American Literature,\" which still remains, for the period at least when it came out, the best book on the subject. For Americans, it was unquestionably the first publication that placed before them and before the world their literature in a systematic and orderly form.\n\nMr. Tr\u00fcbner had not only by hard study acquired great and varied knowledge, but he was unselfish and large-hearted, and always ready to place his knowledge, without\nreserve, at the disposal of his friends. He was a kind of link between the American and the Asiatic world, for he had the energy of a first-class publisher, with so sound a scholarly instinct as led him to sympathize with and to materially assist authors. His place, therefore, cannot be filled, at least for the present, and he will be missed alike by those who were enabled by his literary enterprize to launch their works before the public, and by those, who, publishing at their own cost, were benefited in a high degree by his counsel and assistance. Mr. Tr\u00fcbner lent himself readily to any measure for advancing and popularizing knowledge, and realizing, at once, the desiderata of the Oriental and Linguistic Field, at once, determined to supply them.\n\nAmong distinguished Foreign scholars, we must mention first Reinhart Pierre Anne Dozy, born on 20th of Feb. 1820, at Leyden, and the member of a family originally French, who, leaving Valenciennes, settled in Holland in 1647. He was, also, descended from the two celebrated Orientalists, John James and Henry Schultens. In June, 1834, he was placed under the care of Dr. J. J. van Gelder, with whom he remained till he was admitted into the University in 1837. Dr. Gelder, who is still alive, at the age of 80, no doubt did much to stimulate M. Dozy's early tastes, as he was in the habit of teaching those of his pupils, who were destined for Holy Orders, the rudiments of the Arabic language, in his opinion, the best preparation for the serious study of Hebrew. It would seem from Dr. Gelder's narrative that Dozy mastered in two months the etymological part of Roorda's Grammar, without neglecting the other and ordinary studies of his school. At the University, he was fortunate in becoming the pupil of a young Professor of Arabic, M. Weijers, who was especially noted for his skill in teaching, as well as for the strict accuracy with regard to grammar he enforced on his pupils. Under him, Dozy's studies, at first somewhat vague and irregular, became fixed and definite, taking, as he did, for\nhis model and his ideal, the works of Etienne Quatrem\u00e8re, which he read and re-read, till he almost knew them by heart.\n\nIn December, 1841, the Dutch Institut proposed for a prize to be given two years after, an essay with the title \"De vestibus, quibus Arabes utriusque sex\u016bs diversis temporibus et in diversis terris usi sunt, aut etiam nunc utuntur,\" etc., a subject remarkably in harmony with the previous course of Dozy's studies.\n\nNaturally, he set to work at it, heart and soul, and, as he did not state the object he had in view, the Curators of the University Library were greatly surprised at the number and variety of the books and MSS. he was daily borrowing. The result was that, in November, 1843, the proposed prize was awarded to him, and, time having been granted to him, to elaborate more fully some parts of his essay, the whole was published in 1845, under the title \"Dictionnaire d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des noms des v\u00eatements chez les Arabes.\" Scholars at once accepted the award of the Institut, and acknowledged that Dozy's essay was a remarkable specimen of lexicographical labour.\n\nAgain, to M. Weijers, Dozy was indebted for his next course of research. It appears that M. Weijers was in the habit of reading with his pupils the Arabic writers of Spanish History, and, hence, Dozy became acquainted with Cond\u00e9's work, Historia de la dominacion de los Arabes en Espa\u00f1a (1826), this leading him to study Spanish, as a means of ascertaining the sources of the history, which Conde himself had but too often carelessly noted or not noted at all. Letters of Dozy's addressed to M. de Vries between 1841 and 1851 are extant, and show with what zeal he took up this new study. Already, he had conceived the plan of dealing himself with a part of Arabo-Spanish history, selecting for his first studies, on the advice of M. Weijers, the period of the Abbasides, as, on their succession to the sway of the Ommayides, they were the chief cultivators of Arts and Sciences in the\nWestern World. His first pages illustrated the Thesis of the Inaugural Lecture he read for the degree of Doctor in 1844.\n\nVery shortly afterwards Weijers died at the early age of 38, and was succeeded by Juynboll, of Groningen.\n\nThe first printed papers of Dozy would seem to have been, a brief one, in the \"Gids,\" on M. Veth's \"Dissertatio de institutis Arabum erudiend\u00e6 juventutis,\" 1844, and, in the same year, one in the Journ. Asiatique, Mai-Juin, \"Histoire des Benou-Ziyan de Tlemcen.\" Marrying shortly afterwards, he availed himself of his honeymoon to travel through Germany and to make acquaintance with many distinguished scholars, such as M. Fleischer. He was, also, so fortunate as to discover at Gotha, an original history of Cid Campeador, and, in the spring of 1845, during his stay in Oxford, two poems, hitherto wholly unknown, among the medi\u00e6val Dutch and Flemish MSS. preserved in the Bodleian.\n\nIn the early part of 1846, Dozy printed the first of a series of Arabic Texts\u2014the historical commentary of Ibn Badroun on the poem of Ibn Abdoun, which refers to the fall of the Aftasids of Badajoz, together with the first part of the Historia Abbadidarum: in the same year he was appointed \"Adjutor Interpretis Legati Warneriani,\" with the duty of cataloguing the MSS. in that collection. The catalogue, drawn up by him in agreement with this order, appeared ultimately, in two volumes, in 1851, and is one of the best ever compiled. The only subjects he omitted were those relating to mathematics, theology, and law.\n\nWhile, however, he was preparing this catalogue, he continued to work unceasingly at the other works he had undertaken; thus, he continued his labours on the \"Historia Abbadidarum,\" and printed, in 1847, Abd-al-W\u00e1hid's Al-Marrak\u00fashi or History of the Almohads, together with \"Notices sur quelques MSS. Arabes,\" for the most part, extracts from Ibn-ol-Akbar's biographies of the most famous men of Spain. This work was not finished till 1851, and, in\nthe mean time, Dozy had issued a portion of Ibn Adh\u00e1ri\u2019s Chronicle of Africa and Spain. Most of these treatises were accompanied by excellent glossaries, giving the words, etc., omitted in Freytag\u2019s Dictionary, and were generally preceded by introductions dealing with questions of importance, scientifically or historically.\n\nIn 1849, appeared the first part of the \u201cR\u00e9cherches sur l\u2019histoire politique de l\u2019Espagne,\u201d a task for which he had shown especial fitness by a dissertation in the Journal Asiatique for 1847 on the Arabic words in a Castilian Chronicle, and by three remarkable articles on Castilian Literature published in the \u201cGids.\u201d The publication of the \u201cR\u00e9cherches\u201d was a death-warrant to Cond\u00e9 and other writers; moreover, what greatly grieved Dozy at the time was that he had to differ widely from many of the statements and views advanced by his friend Don Pascual de Gayangos, in his History of the Muhammedan Dynasties of Spain, published in 1840\u20133 by the Oriental Translation Fund. By far the most important part of Dozy\u2019s work was the determining the exact history of the Cid, around whom so much legendary fog had been accumulated. Dozy discovered that the Chronica General of Alfonso X., generally supposed to be false, except by M. H\u00fcber, was really a translation from the Arabic, and, what is more important, that the Arab writer was a contemporary of the Cid: he further showed how this savage Condottieri became the hero of Castilian poetry.\n\nIt need scarcely be added that his \u201cR\u00e9cherches\u201d met with ready acceptance from all who were competent to judge of the subject and of the method of its treatment. Even, in Spain, the value of Dozy\u2019s views, opposed as they necessarily were to those of the native writers, was fully recognized, and the writer was elected a Corresponding Member of the \u201cAcademia de la Historia\u201d in 1851.\n\nIn 1850, Dozy was appointed Professor of History, greatly to his satisfaction; and, in the following March, he gave his\ninaugural lecture, his subject being, \"The favourable influence of the Revolutions in France since 1789 on the study of the History of the Middle Ages\": in this lecture, he broke through the previous custom, which required that such orations should be in Latin, by giving it in his native language, Dutch; a practice in which he persevered in all his future courses of lectures. Many of his friends doubted, at the time, whether the considerable duties of the chair of History would not compel him to relinquish his studies on subjects he had made his own; the result however showed that his obtaining this appointment greatly widened his range of view and gave him greater power of dealing with solid historical research. Each year he gave his pupils a new period of history, and a good idea may be obtained of the wide extent of his lectures from the notices of them in the contemporary \"Gids.\" He wrote, also, an article on Drumann's Boniface VIII. in the Athen\u00e9um Fran\u00e7ais of Dec. 1852, and a brief paper, \"On Spain and the French Revolution,\" in Sybel's Historische Zeitschrift, ix. pp. 83\u2013104. It is much to be hoped that these separate essays may be collected and published in one volume.\n\nIn 1851 the post of \"Adjutor,\" he had so long held, was given to his friend Dr. Kuenen, the President of last year's Oriental Congress at Leyden.\n\nIn the same year, Messrs. W. Wright, Krehl, and Dugat, associated themselves with him, at his suggestion, with the view of publishing the introduction written by Al-Makkari, as a preface to the life of Ibn-ol-Khatib, and this work was subsequently published, between 1856 and 1869, under the title of \"Analectes sur l'histoire et la litt\u00e9rature des Arabes d'Espagne,\" in two quarto vols. of about 900 pages each. M. Dugat added, in 1861, an introduction and index, and M. Fleischer a list of corrections. When it is remembered that, for his share of the work, M. Dozy had to transcribe 400 quarto pages, to collate his copy with many MSS., besides\nthose of the originals used by Al-Makkari himself, one can form some idea of the zeal with which he must have worked, seeing that this publication was really a parergon, and that he did not neglect for it any of the other subjects on which he was occupied.\n\nAt length, in 1861, Dozy was able to publish the Magnum Opus of his life, for which he had been so long collecting the materials\u2014the \"Histoire des Musulmans de l'Espagne,\" in four volumes. Of these, the first deals with the Early Civil Wars, which, commencing in the East, were carried on with even greater ferocity in the West; the second, The Christians and the Renegades, described Spain under the Romans and the Goths, with the conquest of the Arabs and the first period of their rule; the third, with the title of Khalifat, gave the history of Spain under the Ommiads; the fourth and last volume comprised the Smaller Dynasties, which then sprang into a temporary existence, and finished with the Conquest of the Al Moravids. An excellent compte-rendu of this great work, which was written in French, has been published by Prof. Veth in the Gids for 1883 (ii. pp. 411\u2013463). The whole work was translated into German in 1874, under the superintendence of Dr. W. W. Comte de Baudissin, with a revision by Dozy himself.\n\nShortly afterwards (in 1863) M. Dozy, at the request of M. Krusemann, of Haarlem, wrote the History of Islam for his collection of the Principal Religions of the World, a work much appreciated in Holland, and of which a second edition was called for in 1880. It was translated into French by M. Chauvin, a Professor in the University of Liege. In the course of this work, M. Dozy came upon references, which did not satisfy him as to the current view of the early Religion of the Arabs, and which led him, therefore, to publish, in 1864, a special essay, entitled \"Les Israelites \u00e0 la Mecque\"\u2014a work of considerable moment, doubtless, but unquestionably marred by the way in which the argument was stated.\nDozy seems to have forgotten, at all events to have not sufficiently borne in mind, how few there were who were sufficiently acquainted with his previous works to follow him in one which, like the present, materially depended on the force of his own ingenious inferences. Indeed, the principal question whether the Feast of Mecca is of Israelitish origin or not is \"adhuc sub judice.\" A proposal on the part of Dozy, to publish a complete edition of Edrisi (sometimes called \"Liber Rogeri,\" as it was compiled by the order of that Prince in the twelfth century), unfortunately fell through, but, from the materials he had collected, Dozy and M. de Goeje were able to publish (in 1866) jointly \"La description de l'Afrique et de l'Espagne\"\u2014a work comprising the text, translation and an ample glossary.\n\nIn 1867, Dozy published, at the suggestion of his friend, Dr. De Vries, under the title of \"Oosterlingen,\" a list explanatory of the Dutch words borrowed from the Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and Turkish, a small undertaking which led to a larger and more important one. As long ago as 1861, M. Engelmann had published a \"Glossaire des Mots Espagnols et Portuguais emprunt\u00e9e \u00e0 l'Arabe,\" which was no longer to be had; and, away, in the Far East, he could not undertake a required new edition; so Dozy did this for him, the result being a volume four times the size of the original. So highly was this work appreciated, that the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions awarded to Engelmann the Prix Volney, which, unfortunately, he did not live to receive. Engelmann's work was based on the \"Vocabulista Aravigo\" of Pedro d'Alcala, which Dozy had, himself, at one time, determined to republish.\n\nIn Feb., 1869, another and a different task fell to his lot. As the retiring \"Rector Magnificus,\" he had to pronounce an oration, which he took care, this time, should be in Latin: he chose for his subject, \"De Causis cur Muhammedanorum cultura et humanitas pr\u00e6c\u00e8 qu\u00e6 est\nChristianorum, imminuta et corrupta sit,\u201d a theme touching very closely one of the difficulties arising from the almost universal decay of the Eastern as compared with the Western populations. Not long after this, fancying he had some reason to complain of the treatment he had received from his old friend, the veteran Orientalist, Fleischer, he wrote \u201cLettre \u00e0 M. Fleischer contenant des remarques critiques et explicatives sur le texte d\u2019Al-Makkari,\u201d a letter which is admitted to be a chef-d\u2019\u0153uvre of criticism. In 1873, he published the \u201cCalendar of Cordova\u201d for the year 961, from a MS. at Paris, the text of which was written in Hebrew characters, and had, also, an ancient Latin paraphrase. This, with two papers\u2014one in the Z.D.M.G. for 1866, the other in the Revue Asiatique for 1869, a study of De Slane\u2019s Prolegomena to Ibn Khaldoun\u2014was really preparatory to his last work, the \u201cSupplement aux Dictionnaires Arabes.\u201d\n\nOn March 9, 1875, his old friends and pupils assembled, and gave him a reception in honour of the twenty-fifth year of his professorship.\n\nThe first portion of his last and, as some think, his greatest work, the \u201cSupplement,\u201d was printed in 1881, and, during the course of the next year and a half, the seven \u201clivraisons\u201d of which it consists were finished, and were at once recognized, by such scholars as Fleischer, as of the highest lexicographical importance. M. Dozy speaks of it in his Preface, as the result of eight years\u2019 constant labour, but it was really one of far greater length, the notes made by him forty years before having to be re-read\u2014often modified\u2014in all cases to be re-studied and verified in their new position. About the same time he was engaged on a new edition of his \u201cRecherches sur l\u2019histoire politique de l\u2019Espagne,\u201d to which he added much new and interesting matter. In the same way, he prepared new editions of his \u201cHistoire des Almohades,\u201d and corrected the texts of Ibn Adh\u00e2r, etc. The last work he did\u2014the only one in his life he had undertaken and not brought to a\nsuccessful result\u2014was the paper he proposed to read to the Oriental Congress at Leyden, as their President. But the hand of death was already on him, and he was compelled to leave to his friend, De Goeje, the completion of the task he had undertaken.\n\nMr. Justus Olshausen, for more than twenty years a member of the Royal Academy of Berlin, died on the 28th of December, 1882. The son of J. W. Olshausen, a Protestant Minister, he was born at Hohenfeld in Holstein on May 9, 1800.\n\nIn 1807, Michaelis received him into his school at Gl\u00fcckstadt, and after a boyhood which showed much promise and aptitude for study, Michaelis, in 1816, carried him to the University of Kiel to study Theology and Philology: for the former, however, as he has himself remarked, he had no earnest desire, as his inclinations were principally for the study of languages, and of these, especially for Hebrew, which he had some years previously studied with his father. He also pursued with zeal the study of the Classics, under Professor Heinrichs, at that time a member of the Philological School there.\n\nIt was in the close of the summer of 1818 that he passed on from the study of Hebrew to Syriac and Arabic, under the guidance of the well-known translator of the Zend-Avesta, J. F. Kleuker. At Easter in 1819, he thought of going to attend the lectures of De Sacy, Kosegarten, etc., and a dwelling had already been hired for him in Paris, when circumstances compelled him to remain another six months at Kiel; in the end, Michaelis took him to Berlin, where he passed some time with Savigny and his two elder brothers, both of whom were already attached to the Faculty of Theology. Orientalism was then at a low ebb in Berlin, and Olshausen does not seem to have had much liking for the professors with whom he came into contact, but he studied for awhile under Ideler, at that time a very popular teacher.\nIn 1820 he went to Paris, and worked under De Sacy, Etienne Quatrem\u00e8re, Langles and Kieffers. While under the last-named Professor, he has recorded that he and M. Gar\u00e7in (de Tassy) were his only pupils. He met there, also, Schultz, who was subsequently murdered in Kurdistan, and Alex. von Humboldt. Three years, subsequently, he obtained his Doctor's Degree for an essay entitled, \"De Lingu\u00e6 Persic\u00e6 verbo.\"\n\nHis first publication of importance was \"Emendationen zum alten Testament,\" etc., Kiel, 1826, of interest for many suggestions, then new. Thus, in studying Isaiah, he came to a conclusion (in advance of the scholars of his time) that the Semitic Chaldees were to be placed in Babylonia, where, therefore, was the \"Ur of the Chaldees,\" and that the population of Babylon was a mixed one, partly Semitic and partly non-Semitic. In 1829, under the auspices of Frederick IV. of Denmark, he published, at Hamburg, \"Vendidad, Zend-avest\u00e6 pars vicesima, adhuc superstee,\" a study which concentrated his attention on Persian literature, and ultimately led to his publication, twenty years later, of his famous Numismatic essay, Die Pahlavi Legenden auf der Munzen der letzten Sassaniden (Lips. 1849), which was translated by the daughter of Prof. H. H. Wilson, and published in the Numismatic Chronicle, vol. xi. pp. 60\u201392, and pp. 121\u2013146 (1849). In continuation of the same line of study, also, may be noted one of the last papers he published, entitled \"Parthava und Pahlav, M\u00e2da und M\u00e2h,\" which appeared, originally, in the Monatsb. of the Berlin Academy for 1876.\n\nThe next work he took in hand differed much from what he had been previously engaged on, namely, a paper entitled \"Zur Topographie des Alten Jerusalem,\" Kiel, 1833. Obviously, this work is now superseded by the large amount of recent discoveries. But it is still of value, for the methodical arrangement of its materials. In the introduction he refers to another work, which was in fact\nchiefly his, the publication of the 3rd volume of Carsten Niebuhr's Travels in Arabia in 1837, one chief value of which was the improvement in the spelling of the geographical names, previously in a very unsatisfactory state. Somewhat later he was engaged for two years on the Catalogue of the Kiel Oriental MSS., but the war between Denmark and Prussia interfered so much with literary pursuits, that the second part did not appear till 1851: the third part was finally completed by Van Mehren in 1857.\n\nIn 1853 Humboldt pleaded, not in vain, for his admission into the service of Prussia, and secured for him the appointment of Chief Librarian and Professor of Oriental Languages at K\u00f6nigsberg, where he issued a new edition of his Hebrew Grammar. In December, 1858, he was called to Berlin (where he lived for the next sixteen years), and created Medicinal-Rath, and, in November, 1873, he celebrated his 50th Jubilee, with general applause. His latest works were, in 1880, Erlauterung zur geschichte d. Pahlavi Schrift; in 1881, Forschungen \u00fcber d. gebiete d. Eranischer sprachkunste; and, in 1882, Zur wurdigung d. Pahlavi glossare und ihrer erkl\u00e4rung durch die Parsen.\n\nDr. Christopher Andr\u00e9 Holmboe, one of the most distinguished Orientalists of Northern Europe, was born in 1796, at Vang in Norway, and, at 14 years of age, entered the Royal College of Christiania. In 1818 he became licentiate in Theology, having previously studied Hebrew (the knowledge of which is required there for this degree), and commenced the study of the other Semitic languages, especially of Arabic and Syriac. Shortly after this period, he was appointed Sub-Librarian of the University.\n\nIn 1821 he went to Paris, and, for two years, studied Arabic and Persian, under MM. Silvestre de Sacy and Caussin de Perceval, and, on his return to his own country in the autumn of 1822, became Reader in Oriental Languages to the University, and in 1828, Professor of these tongues.\nIn 1830, he was nominated Keeper of the Coins and Medals, and, not long after, as on more than one subsequent occasion, became the acting Head of the Administrative Council of the University. In 1843, 1848, and 1866, the King of Sweden conferred on him various honours, marking the estimation in which he was justly held\u2014while the inhabitants of Christiania constantly elected him as the chief of the commission which fixed, year by year, the sum each citizen had to contribute towards the expenses of the town. He was, also, the first Vice-President (and, subsequently, President) of a Scientific Society at Christiania, founded by the Professors of the University, in 1857, on the Anniversary of King Charles XV.\n\nProfessor Holmboe's studies embraced a singularly wide range of subjects, but may be conveniently noticed under the four heads\u20141. Biblical. 2. Archaeological. 3. Numismatical. 4. Comparative Philology, Sanskrit, Norwegian, Celtic, and the Languages of Southern Africa.\n\nIn the first, M. Holmboe was appointed with M. Caspari in 1846, on a commission, the object of which was the revision of the Danish translation from the Hebrew of the Old Testament, and the preparation of a new version, which led him to publish, as a preliminary, The Book of Psalms in 1851, and the Book of Genesis in 1854. On this branch of his subject, he also published in 1828 a Biblical Geography; and an abridged form of the same work, for the use of schools, in 1838 and 1847: a defence of the translation in the Septuagint and Vulgate of the word Kochiteh (Journ. Scient. Christiania, 1859): and, in the same, a paper on the meaning of the word Teref: and, On the Visions of Ezekiel and the Chaldaean Astrolabe (Christ. 4\u00b0. 1860).\n\nIn Archaeology, M. Holmboe devoted himself to researches bearing directly on Religion, and, naturally, to the mythology and funereal rites or customs of his own northern land. His principal detached work on this subject\nia, Traces of Buddhism in Norway before the Introduction of Christianity, Paris, 1857; a work well noticed in both the Journal des Savants and the Revue Contemporaine, of the same year. Considerable extracts were made from it by Rajendra Mitra, and published in the Journ. Bengal As. Soc. for 1858. Besides these, he wrote a great many articles for the Scientific Soc. of Christiania, all, however, in the Swedish language.\n\nMr. Holmboe was an excellent Numismatist, and we owe to him several treatises which have thrown much new light on this science, especially in connexion with Scandinavia. His principal works are\u2014\n\n1. Description of the Ornaments and Coins of the Eighth and Ninth Centuries found in Norway in 1834\u2014Christ. 1835, and a second edition 1854. Much of this memoir has been published, also, in Grote's Bl\u00e4tter f. Munzkunde, vol. 2.\n\n2. On Fifteen Hundred Medi\u00e6val Coins recently found in Norway, Christ. 1837. In Grote, and in the Urdu (a local Journal). Bergen. 1837.\n\n3. On the Ancient Monetary System of Norway, and on the recent find of some Coins of the Twelfth Century. Christ. 1841.\n\n4. On the Oldest Monetary System of Norway (in K\u00f6hne's Numism. Zeitschr.).\n\n5. On the Origin of the Scandinavian Weight System.\n\nHe wrote, also, a great number of minor essays, which we have not space to record here, and these, not only in the Journals of his own country, but in K\u00f6hne's Zeitschrift, the Memoires de la Soc. Imp\u00e9r. d'Arch\u00e9ol. de St. P\u00e9tersbourg, the Numismatic Chronicle of London, Bl\u00e4tter f\u00fcr Munzkunde, &c. &c.\n\nIn Comparative Philology, Holmboe was peculiarly at home, and published several works alike important and interesting, bringing, as he did, to this study long previous research and well-matured views. His first produc-\ntion was The Sanskrit and the Old Norse (Christiania, 1846), a memoir subsequently translated into French, and published in the Journ. Asiat. iv. ser. ix. and x. 1847. Two years later, he printed The Old Norse Verb compared with the Sanskrit and other Cognate Languages, Christ. 1848. In this short but very interesting paper, M. Holmboe points out that the popular dialects of Norway and, especially, of its secluded valleys, have preserved a number of old words not now found in Norwegian literature, but existing slightly changed in Sanskrit. It was clearly a matter of philological importance to establish, as he did, beyond any doubt whatever, the close existing connexion between the Old Scandinavian and the Sanskrit Verb. This paper is fully noticed in the Journ. Asiat. for July, 1848, by M. Mohl. Another essay by him on a nearly similar subject, the Relative Pronoun and the Conjunctions of the Old Norwegian Language, Christ. 1850, is also fully noticed by M. Garcin de Tassy in the Journ. Asiat. for Jan. 1851. In 1852 he printed, at Vienna, A Comparative Dictionary of Norwegian, Sanskrit, and other Cognate Languages; and, in 1854, at Christiania, a short essay On Norwegian and Celtic, in which he showed the close connection between the ancient Norwegian (or Icelandic) and the still older Aryan or Sanskrit idioms. Many Sanskrit words he found common to the Celtic and Norse tongues, which had been so altered in the Teutonic dialects as to be no longer recognizable, and some grammatical forms, agreeing in Norse, Celtic, and Sanskrit, but no longer extant in the Germanic languages. He drew from these facts the conclusion that there must have been, in remote ages, a considerable commerce between the Celts and the Norwegians (see, also, an article on this memoir, by M. Garcin de Tassy, in the Journ. Asiat. of Dec. 1854).\n\nBut these were not all his philological works. In 1850, he edited, with a Preface and Notes, a Zulu Grammar, com-\npiled by M. Lohrender; and, in 1856, published in the Journal of the American Oriental Society, vol. 2, Ideas respecting an Alphabet suited to the Languages of Southern Africa. He printed, also, a translation from the Arabic into German of the Calila and Dimna, or Fables of Bidpai, Christ. 1832, and the Turkish Catechism of Muhammed ben Pir El-Berkevi.\n\nM. Heinrich August J\u00fcschke, the well-known Moravian Missionary, was born at Herrnhut, May 17, 1817, and died Sept. 29, 1883.\n\nHe received his theological training in the Moravian College at Niesky, in Silesia, where he held subsequently for several years (1842\u20131856) various appointments on the educational staff. In the last-named year, he undertook the superintendence of the Mission Station at Kyelang, in Kahoul, in the Western Himalayas, where he found an ample opportunity for the exercise of his remarkable linguistic abilities. Hence, during the twelve years (1856\u20131868) of his residence in this mountain tract, besides the writing of various Tibetan papers for the use of his Mission, he found the time to work steadily at a translation of the New Testament into Tibetan, and, also, to collect a mass of materials for a comprehensive Dictionary of that language. His letter to Schiefner (Bull. Acad. de St. Petersburg, Feb. 10, 1864), and his Essay (Berlin Acad. Sitzungsberichte, 1866), On the Phonetic Laws of Tibetan, demonstrate his philological acumen and the deep insight he had gained into the nature of that language. An earlier essay (ibid. 1860) supplied Prof. Lepsius with valuable materials for his book \"\u00dceber Chinesische und Tibetische Laut-verh\u00e4ltnisse,\" which was printed in 1861.\n\nThe three linguistical essays from his pen, which were printed by the Kyelang Mission, clearly mark the progress of his studies. They are: 1. A short practical Grammar of the Tibetan language, with special reference to the spoken\nDialects (1865) :\u20142. A Romanized Tibetan and English Dictionary (1866) :\u20143. An Introduction to the Hindi and Urdu Languages for Tibetans (1867).\n\nIn the year following this (1868) Mr. J\u00e4schke was compelled, for health's sake, to return to Europe. It chanced that, on his way home, he met the late Dr. Burnell, who took, as was his wont, great interest in the Tibeto-German Dictionary, on which M. J\u00e4schke was then engaged, and at once gave him so liberal a contribution towards the expenses of printing it, as to almost cover the whole cost of publication. This work (a handsome quarto of 632 pages) was lithographed (at least the first portion of it) at Magdeburg; the latter half was completed at Herrnhut in 1873.\n\nAbout the same time, Mr. J\u00e4schke undertook, at the request of the India Office, to make a revised edition of it, which was, subsequently, printed by Unger & Co., at Berlin, an edition which has the advantage of an excellent Tibetan type, designed by himself and of a full English-Tibetan Index. A Translation of the New Testament is, we believe, at present passing through the same press.\n\nMr. J\u00e4schke had undertaken a new edition of his Tibetan Grammar for Mr. Tr\u00fcbner's Oriental Series, but the disease to which he recently succumbed made too rapid strides for him to be able to make the additions and corrections he wished. Though it may be long ere Tibet is fully opened up to European commerce and enterprise, there can be no doubt that the importance of Mr. J\u00e4schke's literary labours will be hereafter fully recognised.\n\nM. Fran\u00e7ois Lenormant, whose untimely death, at the early age of 47 years, every scholar throughout Europe, must have mourned, was born at Paris in Jan. 17, 1837, and died there Dec. 11, 1883.\n\nThe son of M. Charles Lenormant, long the eminent Keeper of the Collection of Antiquities at the Biblioth\u00e8que\nin Paris (himself the victim of a fever he caught in 1859, during his archaeological researches in Greece), Lenormant was, from his earliest years, bred up among studies, to which, in later times, he devoted himself with a zeal and assiduity rarely surpassed. There is no doubt he was a precocious child, and gifted with an extraordinary memory as well as with a wonderful facility for the acquisition of knowledge, and, further, that his father early discerned the character of the child he had to educate; hence he taught him himself and did not send him to any gymnasium or university. In his fourteenth year the Rev. Arch\u00e9ologique published for him a letter to M. Hase, On Greek Tablets found at Memphis: in 1854, he printed, in the Correspondant, a critical study of M. Garrucci's work On the Inscriptions traced on the Walls of Pompeii (graffiti), and in the M\u00e9langes d'Arch\u00e9ol. of the P.P. Cahier and Martin, a paper \"On the celebrated Greek Inscription of Autun,\" etc. In 1857 he gained the Numismatic Prize of the Acad. d. Inscriptions for his \"Essai sur la Classification des Monnaies des Lagides,\" and in the same year, became a Licentiate of the \"Facult\u00e9 de Droit.\"\n\nIn Oct. 1859, he went to Greece with his father, on the untoward journey which cost the latter his life, and was at Athens with his mother in 1860, when the news came of the massacre of the Maronite Christians by the Druses. He was among the first to carry relief to Syria, and his letters to the French journals compelled the Government of the day to send a military force. The letters or papers issued by him, about this period, were\u2014History of the Massacres in Syria in 1860 (Paris, 1861); Letters to Lord John Russell \"On the Government of the Ionians,\" 1861; Two French Dynasties among the Southern Slaves in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries (1861); Archaeological Researches at Eleusis (1862), in which year he was appointed Sub-Librarian of the Institute; Essai sur l'organisation politique et \u00e9co-\nnomique de la Monnaie dans l\u2019Antiquit\u00e9 (1863); Monographie sur la Voie Sacr\u00e9e Eleusinienne (1864); La Gr\u00e8ce et les \u00celes Ionniennes (1865); and, in 1866, Les Turcs et les Montenegrins. In the same year he commenced his Phenician publications and issued \u201cIntroduction \u00e0 un Memoire sur la Propagation de l\u2019Alphabet Ph\u00e9nicien dans l\u2019ancien monde\u201d; about the same time, also, he inaugurated his Assyrian studies, and by the force of his genius and the vivacity and brilliancy of his style, greatly helped M. Oppert to make these studies popular in France.\n\nA great many miscellaneous papers and letters from his pen will be found in the \u201cComptes Rendus\u201d for 1870 and subsequent years. To these may be added, \u201cLes Tableaux du Mus\u00e9e de Naples,\u201d with illustrations in outline of those famous Art-treasures; he, also, did much for M. Robiou\u2019s splendid work, \u201cChefs-d\u2019\u0152uvre de l\u2019Antique.\u201d\n\nTo Assyrian subjects M. Lenormant contributed many interesting papers and books, as, for instance, his \u201cLettres Assyriologiques,\u201d his \u201cCommentaire sur les fragments Cosmogoniques de Berosus,\u201d his \u201cMagie chez les Chald\u00e9ens,\u201d which was translated into English and German; his \u201cChoix des Textes Cun\u00e9iformes in\u00e9dits,\u201d his \u201c\u00c9tudes Accadiennes,\u201d etc. He, also, threw himself with genuine enthusiasm into the Sumero-Akkadian battle-field.\n\nIt would be impossible, within our limits, to give anything like a complete list of all that M. Lenormant wrote; but, perhaps, the book of his which has been most read, and by which he will be best remembered, is his \u201cManuel de l\u2019Histoire Ancienne de l\u2019Orient,\u201d which has passed through eight editions during the last fifteen years. During his later years, M. Lenormant devoted himself to the study and literature of the Holy Scriptures, and published two especial works on this subject, one \u201cLes Origines de l\u2019Histoire d\u2019apr\u00e8s la Bible et les traditions des peuples Orientaux\u201d; the\nsecond, \"Le Gen\u00e8se,\" a translation of the Book of Genesis, the treatment of which, naturally, led to much discussion: it is, moreover, a work little likely to carry conviction to any, except a special class of students. The lamented death of M. Lenormant was mainly caused by exposure and over-exertion during his excavations, last year, in Magna Graecia. As is well known, during the war between France and Germany, he had received a severe wound, and this wound opened again, and produced disease of the periosteum, with intense suffering. Add to which, his usually strong constitution had been severely tried by the malarious poison he had imbibed in the marshes of Southern Italy.\n\nOf a writer so versatile, who, in a life comparatively brief, had extended his researches over a range so wide, it is difficult to speak critically, but it may be truly said of him that, allowing for occasional hasty generalizations, he was an original thinker, and in no sense the appropriator of other men's discoveries. Most justly has an intimate friend said of him, \"His gigantic powers of work, his wide sympathies, his quickness of perception, and his unrivalled erudition, all combined, place him in the foremost rank of scientific pioneers.\" Familiar, alike, with the learning of classical times, and with the results of monumental research in Western Asia, M. Lenormant was able to point out, as has never been done so well before, how intimate is the connection between these apparently divergent studies. \"All that he wrote was suggestive and stimulating; and most of the mistakes charged on him by antagonists were due to the rapidity with which he worked. Such inaccuracies of detail may be regretted, but, when occurring in the writings of a constructive genius like Lenormant, they are no more blemishes than are the spots on the face of the sun.\" Above all, Lenormant was no mere scholar; he was, for his generation, far more useful, in that he enabled the many to learn,\nfrom a master mind, things little known save to the few. And it is here we shall miss him most. His Manual of Ancient History was on the point of being re-cast when death, after nine months of great suffering, closed the labours of its author. So, too, we mourn the incompletion of other works so grandly begun, such as the \"Propagation de l'Alphabet Ph\u00e9nicien,\" the history of \"La Monnaie dans l'Antiquit\u00e9,\" the \"Chefs-d'Oeuvre de l'Art Antique,\" and \"La Grande Gr\u00e8ce.\" With all his errors or shortcomings, these, too, at all times most readily admitted by himself, it is but just to say that the world of letters has no one who can, at the present time, replace him.\n\nThe Council, at their meeting of June 18, 1883, appointed Messrs. T. H. Thornton, Cust and their Secretary, to represent the Royal Asiatic Society at the meeting of the Oriental Congress to be held at Leyden in September. These gentlemen attended the Congress, and a report of its proceedings was read to the Society by the Secretary at the meeting of Nov. 19th.\n\nDuring the winter a sub-committee, consisting of the Director, Sir H. C. Rawlinson, Sir Lewis Pelly, and Messrs. Fergusson, Grote, Thornton, Lewin, and Keatinge, met, and after a conference with the late Mr. Nicholas Tr\u00fcbner, agreed to the following Rules as the basis of the future arrangement with Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner for the publication of the Society's Journal:\u20141. That, in future, the Journal of the Society be published by Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner on pure commission terms. 2. That the selling price of each number of the said Journal be fixed by the Council of the Society. 3. That Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner render to the Society twice a year, an account of the numbers of the Journal sold by them during the previous six months, at the rate of 50 per cent. off the fixed publication price; it being understood that the 50 per\ncent. thus allowed to them, covers trade allowances, discount, advertisements, commissions, and all other expenses, exclusive of the postage of the Journal to Members of the Society. 4. That Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner shall have the privilege of inserting any advertisements of their own books, in each number, free of charge, on paying direct to the printer all costs of such advertisements, both as regards printing and paper, together with all extra postage, as, would naturally, fall on the Society. 5. That this agreement be in force for five years, subject to reconsideration at the end of this time.\n\nUnfortunately, though he had expressed his full assent to the above terms, Mr. Tr\u00fcbner did not sign the agreement before his lamented death, so the above statement can now only be taken as the basis of the agreement to which the Sub-Committee of the Council and Mr. Tr\u00fcbner had respectively come.\n\nThe Council have also sent letters of congratulation to Sir Moses Montefiore, Bart., on his attainment of his hundredth anniversary, and to the Council of the Bengal Asiatic Society on their celebration, last November, of the centenary of the Society.\n\nThey have also addressed to Her Majesty, the Queen, and to the Duchess of Albany, letters of condolence on the untimely death of H.R.H. the Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, K.G., and to Lady Bayley, on the death of her husband, Sir Edward Clive Bayley, K.C.S.I., C.I.E., who had been so long associated with the Society in Oriental researches.\n\nIn connection with the death of H.R.H. the Duke of Albany, K.G., the Council have great pleasure in printing an original poem in Arabic, which has been written by one of their members, Mr. Habib Anthony Salmon\u00e9, with a translation of the same by Edwin Arnold, Esq., C.S.I., a member of the Council of the Society.\n\u0645\u064f\u0631\u064e\u0641\u0650\u0651\u064a\u064e\u0629\n\n\u0648\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0649 \u0645\u064e\u0627

Can India be made more interesting? By H. G. Keene, Esq., C.I.E., M.R.A.S. Read June 18, 1883.\n\n2. On the Importance to Great Britain of the Study of Arabic. By Habib A. Salmon\u00e9, Esq., M.R.A.S. Read Nov. 19, 1883.\n\n3. On the Fishes of Western India. By W. F. Sinclair, Esq., M.R.A.S. Read Dec. 17, 1883.\n\n4. On the Origin of the Indian Alphabet. By R. N. Cust, Esq., Hon. Sec. R.A.S. Read Jan. 21, 1884.\n\n5. Some Further Gleanings from the Si-yu-ki. By the Rev. Prof. Beal, M.R.A.S. Read Feb. 18, 1884.\n\n6. Observations on the Early Languages of Mesopotamia By Theophilus G. Pinches, Esq., M.R.A.S. Read March 14, 1884.\n\n7. On Extracts from the Translation of the Roll of Shiuten D\u014dji, a famous Japanese outlaw of the Tenth Century. By F. V. Dickins, Esq., M.R.A.S. Read April 21, 1884.\n\n8. The She King for English Readers. By Clement F. R. Allen, Esq., M.R.A.S., H.B.M. Consul, Pakhoi, China. Read May 5, 1884.\n\nOf these papers, as Nos. 2, 5, 6, have been already printed in the Society\u2019s Journal, it is not necessary to say more about them here. Of the others, the following are brief analyses.\n\nThus, Mr. H. G. Keene, in his paper entitled \u201cCan India be made more interesting?\u201d noticed, generally, the leading characteristics of the natives of that peninsula, viz. the Negrito, the Turanian, and the Aryan, each of whom must be studied separately. Asia, he held, is the home of the religion, language, and literature of Europe; society, there, having come down from the earliest ages in an unbroken continuity. Among all subsequent modifications, the old\nelements remain; thus Brahman, Buddhist, Greek, Arab, Mongol, Portuguese, and French have, all in turn, scratched the surface, but with the exception of the Brahmans and the Buddhists, comparatively little remains of these successive inroads or settlements. The welfare of the people of India depended, he thought, for the most part, on the principles of administration, and on the personnel whereby these principles are applied.\n\nMr. Sinclair, in his paper read Dec. 17, 1883, \"On the Fishes of Western India,\" stated that the particular subject he had selected was chosen for the reason that, till lately, the Fisheries of Western India had been much neglected; and, also, because he had thus the opportunity of noticing some works which were of general value to beginners in the study of Ichthyology, as well as to sportsmen.\n\nWith this view, therefore, he desired to call attention to two books, viz. Mr. Thomas's \"Rod in India\" and Major Beavan's \"Fresh Water Fishes of India,\" the latter being, in his judgment, a complete manual of Ichthyology, and an admirable monograph on this class of the whole subject. \"Sea Fishes,\" he added, have been exhaustively treated by Dr. Day, but the technical form of his great work, together with its price and weight, place it beyond the reach of most amateur observers. An abridgment of it in 8vo. would prove a real boon to practical students.\n\nMr. Sinclair then pointed out that there were many mammals or reptiles, often untruly placed under the head of fishes, because their habit was to take for themselves the baits intended for the fishes, and thus to get into nets intended for others. The mammals are fully dealt with in Mr. Jerdon's work, to which an excellent supplement has been added by Mr. Sterndale, with special reference to those of the Trans-Gangetic Provinces. This supplement, also, notices the porpoises of the Irrawaddy, which differ, generically, from those of the Ganges or Indus.\nThe reptiles have been fully described by Dr. Nicholson of the Madras Service; but the lizards and crocodiles, tortoises and turtles, the frogs and toads, have been, as yet, only described collectively in Dr. G\u00fcnther's Monograph on Indian Reptiles, published some years since by the Ray Society. A reprint of Dr. G\u00fcnther's work, omitting the snakes, is much wanted.\n\nThis done, only two more chapters would be required for the Crustacea and Mollusca, which have not as yet secured their \"Vates Sacer.\"\n\nMr. Cust, in his paper, read Jan. 21, 1884, gave a brief description of the present position of the question of the origin of the Indian Alphabet and of the views held in recent times by the leading scholars of Europe and India. This paper was the outcome of a previous one on the same subject read by him at the Leyden Congress, which led to a long discussion at the time.\n\nMr. F. V. Dickins in his paper, read April 21, 1884, gave extracts from the Roll of Shiuten Doji, a famous Japanese outlaw of the tenth century; the Roll, itself, consisting of six \"makimono,\" or scrolls, being beautifully caligraphed and illuminated, and the principal scenes of a somewhat gruesome story brilliantly depicted. Mr. Dickins ascribed this work to the early days of the Tokugawa Dynasty, and believed it to be due to either a Buddhist monk or to artists maintained in the household of some Fudai or Vassal Baron of the Shogun.\n\nThe story, a version of one of the chief exploits of the traditional hero Yorimitsu or Raiko, presented the usual features of such tales, whether told in the Far East or in the West, but possessed a special interest, from the curious mixture it displayed of the scholarly sweetness characteristic of the Chinese style, and of the somewhat overdone ferocity equally characteristic of Old Japan. The whole is cast in a\nBuddhist mould, and permeated by an under current of Shintuism.\n\nMr. Clement Allen, M.R.A.S., H.M. Consul at Pakhoi, China, in his paper entitled \"The She-King for English Readers,\" showed that the work in question consisted of a collection of archaic poetry such as is found in all nations in their primitive styles of civilization. He divided the poems into\u20141. Idylls. 2. War songs. 3. Laudatory Odes. 4. Festival and Sacrificial Odes. 5. Satires, Lampoons, and Moral Pieces. 6. Fragments, &c. Mr. Allen stated his belief that these poems were all capable of translation into English verse, but argued that, in making translations, it was necessary to abide by the text and not to be misled by the commentaries.\n\nJournals.\u2014Royal Asiatic Society.\u2014Since the last Anniversary of May 21, 1883, Parts III. and IV. of Vol. XV. and Parts I. and II. of Vol. XVI. have been issued, containing the following papers:\n\nThus, in Vol. XV.

Pinches, Esq., M.R.A.S.\n\nThe Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal has kept up its well-assured character. Thus, in vol. lii. pt. 1, No. 2, we have papers by the Rev. C. Swynnerton, M.R.A.S., On Folk-Tales of the Upper Panjab; by Mr. R. Roskell Bayne, On researches made by him on the site of Old Fort William at Calcutta; by G. A. Grierson, M.R.A.S., On Bih\u00e1ri Declension and Conjugation, with notes on this paper, by Dr. A. F. Rudolf Hoernle; by Dr. Rajendralala Mitra, On the Temples of Deoghar; and by Charles J. Rodgers, M.R.A.S., On the rupees of the months of the Illahi Years of Akbar. The last two papers will be noticed under their respective subjects, viz. Archaeology and Numismatics.\n\nThe first paper, by Mr. Swynnerton, is interesting, giving as it does tales and stories collected by him from the lips of the peasantry of the Upper Panjab, most of which will necessarily die out with the advance of European civilization. It is a pity that such fleeting records should not be more sought out and secured for other districts, where they doubtless exist.\n\nMr. Bayne's account of his researches on the site of Old Fort William, with the five plates he has given, is valuable, in that it seems to be pretty certain that he has solved the problem of the position of the famous Black Hole, into which Mr. Holwell and his 145 companions were thrust; at the\nsame time, Mr. Bayne wisely points out that this name was not derived from the catastrophe (as is commonly supposed), but was the common title given to the military prison.\n\nMr. Grierson's Essay on Bih\u0101r\u012b Declension and Conjugation is, like all he does, a thoroughly scholar-like performance, and illustrates the remarkable changes and modifications which may arise in the language of a people, even if they do not possess anything that can be called Literature. With an energy peculiar to their race, Mr. Grierson states that they have disembarrassed themselves, to a large extent, of the somewhat cumbrous grammatical forms of their ancestors, and have succeeded in wearing down periphrases and compounds into new words which bear no outward sign of their origin. Dr. Hoernle's notes on the preceding paper have value as those of a scholar who has paid special attention to the Gaudian Languages. For a further study of this subject, see Mr. Grierson's article in the Journal of this Society for the present year, entitled \"Some Bih\u0101r\u012b Folk-Songs.\"\n\nIn the Proceedings of the Society are, as usual, a number of brief notices, to some of which we shall now call attention.\n\nThus there is a report by Mr. A. C. Carlleyle, On recently-discovered Sepulchral Mounds, etc.:\u2014by J. Beames, Esq., M.R.A.S., On the History of Orissa under Muhammadan, Maratha, and English Rule:\u2014by H. Rivett-Carnac, Esq., M.R.A.S., On a Brass Casting of the Arms of the Old India Co., found by Mr. T. A. Gennoe in a Hindu Temple of the Faizabad District, with the statement that it had been worshipped for many years as a Hindu Deity and bathed and anointed with sandal wood every day! :\u2014by Mr. F. S. Growse, A Note on the word Nult\u00e1r or Ni\u015bar:\u2014by Mr. J. W. Parry, Notes on the Nanjia, a religious sect:\u2014by Sirdar Gurdi\u00e1l Singh, Memorandum on the Superstitions connected with Birth, etc., among the Jats of Hash-y\u00e1rpur in the Panjab:\u2014by the Rev. T. P. Hughes,\nM.R.A.S., Notice of a visit to Kafiristan in 1882:\u2014by Mr. Cockburn, An Account of a Drawing in a Cave of the Rhinoceros Indicus:\u2014by Mr. Peal, An Account of a Journey up the Dibang Basin:\u2014by Mr. Cockburn, Of Petrographs in the Kaimur District:\u2014by Professor Max M\u00fcller, Hon. M.R.A.S., Of an Edition of the Sarvana Krama to be published in the Ancedota Oxoniensia:\u2014by Mr. V. A. Smith, M.R.A.S., On the Salivahana Era:\u2014by J. Beames, Esq., M.R.A.S., On Old Dutch Hatchments in the Church of Chinsurah:\u2014and by Rajendrulala Mitra, Hon. M.R.A.S., On Gonardiya and Gonikaputra, as Names of Patanjali. There are also many notices of inscriptions and coins, which will be recorded in their respective places.\n\nBombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, vol. xvi. No. xli.\u2014This Society has recently published an extra paper, being a detailed report, by Prof. Peter Peterson, of his \"Operations in Search of Sanskrit MSS. in the Bombay Circle,\" Aug., 1882\u2013March, 1883. In the course of this paper, Prof. Peterson gives an interesting account of the work he has accomplished, since the departure of Dr. Kielhorn, M.R.A.S., in conjunction with Prof. Bhundarkar, Hon. M.R.A.S. The most important results he arrived at were the thorough appreciation of the objects he had in view by the native learned men, and the evidence he was able to give, to use his own words, that \"much which remains for the European to discover has never been hid from the native learned community.\" His details, however, are beyond the limits of this Report. It should, perhaps, however, be noted that he found a considerable fragment of poems attributable (at all events, traditionally) to the great grammarian Panini (p. 41), and further that the courtesy extended to him by H.H. the Maharaja of Jeypur fully confirms what we already know from Dr. B\u00fchler. A complete catalogue of the Jeypur library would be a boon to\nall students, and this could, Dr. Peterson thinks, be easily accomplished by the \"pandits at Jeypur,\" if means could be found to satisfy the vested interests of the hereditary keepers of the books.\n\nDr. Peterson adds \"Extracts from the MSS. acquired by Government, and from others belonging to H.H. the Maharana of Oudeypore, together with list of the MSS. acquired by the Government,\" and two Appendices\u20141. A Catalogue of the Palm-leaf MSS. in Santinath's Bhandar, Cambay; and 2. A Notice of Bana, his predecessors and contemporaries.\n\nAltogether, Dr. Peterson's report may be fairly considered as one of the best of the many valuable recent researches into the vast, but as yet little known, collections of Sanskrit MSS. in the native libraries of India.\n\nVol. xvi. No. 42, 1883, contains four epigraphical papers by Messrs. Bhagvanlal Indraji, Hon. M.R.A.S., and J. F. Fleet respectively; five Numismatic papers by Col. Prideaux, Gerson da Cunha, and Surgeon-Major O. Codrington; and Neryosangh's Sanskrit Translation of the Khordah-Avesta, by the Rev. A. F\u00fchler. The last is an important contribution to the history of early Pahlavi translations.\n\nCeylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1882.\u2014The Society has this year published as an extra number a translation by Mr. Albert Gray, M.R.A.S., from the French of MM. Dufr\u00e9mery and Sanguinetti, of Ibn Batuta's account of the Maldive Islands and of Ceylon. It is well known that Ibn Batuta spent twenty years in travels over all the then Muhammadan world, between A.D. 1325 and 1349; and that he was at the Maldive Islands [and subsequently in Ceylon and Bengal] from the beginning of 1343 to August, 1344. The narrative is very interesting, and Mr. Gray may be congratulated on the way he has performed his task. It would be of much interest if monographs of\nother places described by Ibn Batuta could be similarly treated, and, from time to time, made public.\n\nJournal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.\u2014In part No. xi. of the Journal of this Society are a considerable number of readable papers, not all, however, on subjects bearing on Oriental History. It will be sufficient here to give a list of them: thus Captain Kelham writes, \"On Malayan Ornithology\":\u2014the Hon. W. E. Maxwell, On Malay Proverbs, an excellent compilation founded mainly on Favre and Klinkert, but re-explained:\u2014Mr. Errington de la Croix gives a translation from a paper by M. Quatrefages on the Pigmies of Homer, Herodotus, Aristotle, Pliny, etc., originally published in the Journ. d. Savants for February and June, 1881:\u2014Mr. W. Cameron writes on the Patani River, with a good map:\u2014Dr. H. W. O'Brien, On a Nervous Disease called Latah:\u2014and the Hon. A. M. Skinner, on the Java System.\n\nJournal Asiatique.\u2014Serie vii. tome 20, part 3 for October, November, December, 1882, was not issued when the Report for last year was printed. It contains an excellent index to the papers, etc., in the Journal from 1873 to 1882, both inclusive. Serie viii. tome 1, No. 1, Janv. was noted in the last Report.\n\nSerie viii. tome 1, No. 2, Febr. Mars, contains the continuation of a paper by M. James Darmesteter, entitled \"Fragments d'un Commentaire sur le Vendidad,\" commenced two years previously. The rest of the number is entirely given to Inscriptions, which will be noticed under Epigraphy, and to the usual brief but valuable notices of books, &c.\n\nSerie viii. tome 1, No. 3, Avril-Mai-Juin, has papers by\nM. Ren\u00e9 Basset, Notes de Lexicographie Berb\u00e8re:\u2014by M. Devic, Une Traduction In\u00e9dite du Coran; while M. L\u00e9on Feer continues his \u00c9tudes Bouddhiques under the title of \"Comment ou devient Arhati.\" M. Aymonier deals with Cambodian Inscriptions; and M. Ganneau continues a former paper on Oriental Seals, &c.\n\nS\u00e9rie viii. tome 2, No. 1, Juillet, contains, as usual, the elaborate Annual Report (this year by M.

Talmud.\nArchaeology.\u2014Since the last Report, Major-General Cunningham has issued two more volumes, the fifteenth and sixteenth. In his fifteenth volume he gives the Results of a Tour he made during the cold season of 1879-80 in Bihar and Northern Bengal, visiting first Mah\u00e2bodhi (or Buddha Gaya), where he picked up two dated inscriptions, one of some importance as giving the date of the accession of Dharma Pala, A.D. 821, the second Prince of the Pala Dynasty of Bengal. The chief places he subsequently went to were Kurkihar and Parbati, which, with several other sites, are noticed by Hiouen-Thsang; identifying, it would seem satisfactorily, many of the Chinese pilgrim\u2019s descriptions; as, e.g. J\u00e2hngira, with its remarkable sculptures in high relief, described by Rajendra Mitra in the Bengal Journal, 1864; and Sult\u00e2ngunj, with the curious archaeological remains (also described by R. Mitra) of a large Buddhist Monastery. Somewhat later he visited Gaur, his description of which is interesting, especially that of the stupendous earthworks raised by old inhabitants to protect their city from the floods of the Ganges. Except that the ruins are now much more clear than when described and photographed by Mr. Ravenshaw several years ago, there is not much to add to that gentleman\u2019s descriptions. General Cunningham\u2019s notes, however, on the present state of these ruins, and his essay on the suburbs of Gaur, with his description of the Jama Masjid, the Adina Masjid, etc., are worth reading. General Cunningham\u2019s notice of Sunargaon or Suvarna Grama, the \u201cGold Town,\u201d which we know from the coins (see Thomas, Pathan Kings of Dehli, 1871), and other sources, to have been the capital of Bengal in Muhammadan times, is good, but adds little to Dr. Wise\u2019s paper in the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society (vol. xliii. 1874).\n\nIt is curious that, though a city essentially of Hindu origin, few fragments of Hindu work now remain to attest\nthis fact, nor, indeed, is even the name of the city mentioned before the reign of the Emperor Balban (A.D. 1265-1287). The most important monument still extant is the presumed tomb of Azam Shah: the pillars around it have now fallen, but are so little injured that General Cunningham suggests that they should be re-erected by Government. The sarcophagus, in a single block of hard black basalt, will last for ages. The difficulty of exploring this old place is clear from General Cunningham's narrative: \"The gigantic tough canes cross the narrow paths in all directions, and with their long sharp flat thorns effectually bar the passage of the stoutest elephants.\"\n\nAt the close of his narrative, he gives (pp. 145-177) some useful \"Notes on the History of Bengal,\" including a genealogy of the earlier Pala Kings, taken from their Inscriptions, of the Sena Rajas of Bengal and of the Muhammadan Rulers of Bengal. The volume is illustrated by thirty-five plates, comprising maps and views of the J\u00e2hngira rocks, plans, sculptures, etc.\n\nIn his sixteenth volume, General Cunningham gives an account of two tours in North and South Bihar, accomplished by him and by his assistant, Mr. Garri\u010dk. In the first, Gen. Cunningham states that (reserving for a while the detailed account of his latest researches at Buddha Gaya, which will form a separate volume, to be brought out by him and Mr. Beglar) he devoted most of his time to the district of Bihar, where he examined the important sites of Kowa Dol, Bar\u00e2bar and Dhar\u00e2wat, the last of which he considers to be the Gunamati Monastery of Hiouen Thsang. Thence, crossing the Ganges at Patna, he went to B\u00e2sarh, the site of the famous city of Vais\u00e2li, but the excavations he made there yielded nothing of importance. At Darbhanga, on the other hand, Mr. Garrick obtained a copy of an important copper-plate inscription, with the date Lakshmana Sena Samvat 293, corresponding with A.D. 1399, his inference\nbeing that the first year of this era was A.D. 1107. He there, also, saw a meteorite, which had fallen on Dec. 2, 1880, and which was already being worshipped by crowds of people from the neighbourhood, as Adbh\u00fbtn\u00e2th, the \"miraculous God.\" At Sita-kund, not far distant, he found a Hindu Temple, in which the only object of worship was a Muhammadan Inscription! Returning southwards, General Cunningham crossed the S\u00f4n, and visited the Brahmanical sites of Deo Markanda, Mahadeopur, and Deo Barn\u00e2rak. His only important discovery, therefore, was an inscription on one of the pillars of the temple, describing some offerings made during the reign of Jivita Gupta, A.D. 730. The temple itself he considers to be two or three centuries older. He thinks that this inscription proves that the Indian arch was in common use in the fourth and fifth centuries of the Christian era.\n\nIncidentally, General Cunningham gives an interesting account of the so-called Buddha's bowl at Kandahar, pp. 8-11; and of the lion-topped pillar at Bakhra, noticed by Hiouen-Thsang. A fine statue of Buddha, found close by in 1854, is now set up in a small adjacent temple and worshipped as Ram Chandr, though the Buddhist inscription on its pedestal, in letters of the tenth century, is still there and legible. He also states that Mr. Beglar has identified Kanwa-dol, the \"crow's rocking stone,\" with the monastery of Silabhadra, which was visited by Hiouen-Thsang in A.D. 637. Many remains of this monastery, of a date, according to him, of about A.D. 580, are still in situ, including a colossal figure of Buddha himself. The details of the remains at Barn\u00e2rak are interesting.\n\nMr. Garrick's tour, in which he went over much of the ground previously crossed by Gen. Cunningham, was chiefly occupied with the district extending northwards from Patna to the Nep\u00e2l frontier, but, at many places, he was able to make useful excavations and to obtain excellent photographs.\nAmong these may be noticed B\u00e1sarh or Vaisali, already alluded to, where he found a curious piece of antiquity, which he thinks was an inkstand (see pl. 4): and some rather interesting excavations he made at Lauriyanavand-ghar, the site of the famous lion-topped Asoka pillar. Besides the Asoka inscription, it appears that there is one of Aurangzeb: the mark of a cannon shot on the upper part of the column is attributed to one of the officers of his army, which marched by it, at the period of the inscribed date, i.e. A.D. 1660\u20131.\n\nThe lion-column seems to be safe from any but accidental injury, as it is an object of daily worship by the villagers of the neighbourhood. Near Lauriya, Mr. Garrick visited a vast mound of solid brickwork, 90 feet high and 250 long, called Chandkigarh, which ought to be examined thoroughly; taking next the recently-discovered Asoka column at Rampurwa, a few miles further to the north, Mr. Garrick suggests, what is likely enough, that the consecutive order in which these different columns are found can hardly be accidental. The Rampurwa L\u00e2t has been thrown down, some think by lightning, but could easily be set up again. The resemblance of the lion on the Lauriya column to the small ivory lions from Nineveh is remarkable, while its abacus as clearly recalls the tori of the capitals at Persepolis or on the tomb of Darius at Pasargadae. Another broken pillar was found near this last, but Mr. Garrick\u2019s means were not sufficient to examine it thoroughly. The Colossus (20 feet long) of Buddha in the state of Nirvana, discovered by Mr. Carleyle, some years ago, has been carefully roofed over. Another statue of Buddha, in blue stone, 11 feet high, has been recently set up by the local authorities. At the conclusion of his tour, Mr. Garrick paid a visit to Buddha-Gaya, and reports the interesting fact that, among recent discoveries, is a portion of an Asoka capital, representing two seated winged lions and a number of small fragments, probably parts of the original column. Another interesting discovery\nwas that of a small sculpture in blue stone, representing the great Temple with the sacred pipal tree, in its original position, on the terrace behind the Temple.\n\nGeneral Cunningham's volume is illustrated by one map and thirty photographs of plans, etc., of the buildings noticed.\n\nThe Government of India has recently printed \"The Second Report of the Curator (Major H. H. Cole, R.E.) of Ancient Monuments in India for the year 1882-3,\" which contains a good deal of miscellaneous Archaeological matter: thus, Major Cole first briefly gives his own personal tours of inspection, etc., between July, 1882, and April, 1883, during the first part of which he visited Dehli, Udaipur, Chittore, Indore, Mount Abu, and Jaipur; and subsequently, Ajmir, Amravati, Bijapur and Ahmadabad, Sanchi, and many places in the North-West Provinces and in the Panjab as far as Peshawar. The rest of his volume is occupied by a series of Appendices, many of them containing useful records of the present state of famous ancient monuments, and of the steps suggested or taken for their preservation from otherwise inevitable destruction. Of these, however, Appendix B., \"Historical British Monuments and Memorials,\" scarcely deserves the prominence given to it. To take the others in their order, Appendix A. affords lists of some of the principal Native Architectural Buildings in Bengal, the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, the Panjab, Kashmir, Rajputana, Central India, Central Provinces, Haidarabad, Maisur, Burma, Madras and Bombay, pp. i-xlix. Each structure is noticed, where possible, under a tabulated series of headings, including the name, general character, custody, preservation, restoration, photographs, drawings, etc., the whole offering a valuable list for future reference and study: we ought, however, to know what is really meant by the ominous word \"restoration.\"\n\nAppendix C. contains a useful Catalogue of Works of\nReference bearing on Indian and Oriental Architecture, Art and Archaeology. Appendix D. deals with Ancient Monuments in Madras, and gives a copy of the plan of Amravati made by Colonel Kennedy in 1816 [which it was scarcely necessary to reproduce], with a list of the sculptures selected for removal by Dr. Burgess in December, 1881, and January, 1882. Some additional details are given, chiefly of the work of Mr. Black, C.E. Appendix E. gives reports and correspondence relating to Ancient Monuments in Bombay. Appendix F. gives ditto for Bengal, with two lithograph plates of Shir Shah's tomb at Sasaram. Appendix G. takes up the subject of the Monuments of Central India, with a plan of Sanchi and of its neighbourhood, and a record of the condition of the monuments there, in 1880\u20131. Appendix H. deals with Rajputana; Appendix I. contains the most interesting and the most fully illustrated of Major Cole's Reports, that on the Ancient Monuments in the Panjab.\n\nIn this section Major Cole gives a map and several plates in illustration of the remains at Eusofzai, showing many of the ancient Greco-Buddhist sites, with illustrations from classical sources and from Persepolis, thus demonstrating a remarkable similarity (to say the least) between the North Indian works and the so-called Pelasgic works in Greece. One of the most remarkable of these is what he calls a \"Domed Granary,\" at Sanghao, Eusofzai. One curious piece of sculpture entitled a \"Woman and Eagle,\" pl. No. 21, Major Cole and General Cunningham compare with the Ganymede of Leochares (or rather its copy), now in the Vatican.\u00b9 On the other hand, many interest-\n\n\u00b9 There is at Bignor, in Sussex, a Mosaic pavement which much more nearly represents the Peshawar sculpture than the statue of Leochares. But there is an essential difference, that the principal figure in the classical representation is a male. In Major Cole's example, and in another copy of the same subject in the Leitner Collection at South Kensington, it is clear that a female is being carried off.\ning sculptures relating to Buddha were found, and have been engraved by Major Cole, and, in some of these, there certainly seems to be a reminiscence of Greek Art in the treatment of the draperies, though not in the portraiture.\n\nAppendices K. and L. deal with Ancient Monuments in the North-West Provinces and Oudh and with those of the Central Provinces. In the last, it may be remarked that there is a good plan showing the general position of the principal Temples at Mandhatta on the River Narbudda. Appendix O. gives a useful list of some of the ancient and modern forts and citadels in India.\n\nThe Government of Madras has printed \"A Sketch of the Dynasties of Southern India, by Robert Sewell, Esq., M.R.A.S.,\" extracted from the larger work, vol. ii. of the Archaeological Survey Series of Southern India. [Mr. Sewell's List of the Antiquarian Remains in the Presidency of Madras, vol. i., was noticed in last year's Report, pp. xlviii-ix.] The idea of this publication is good, and, as a work for ready chronological reference, it will be found useful. It is not, as the compiler states, \"intended as a complete history, the subject of South Indian History being yet in its infancy.\" The arrangement, to assist reference, is alphabetical; but it would be of still more value to students if, at some future time, Mr. Sewell were able to print some synchronistical tables, so that the order of the succession of the different Dynasties and Families could be seen at a glance. The general index of names is well done.\n\nThe Ceylon Government has published a very interesting paper, drawn up by H. C. P. Bell, Esq., of the Ceylon Civil Service, entitled, \"The Maldivian Islands, an Account of the Physical Features, Climate, History, Inhabitants, Productions, and Trade.\" Of this report, or rather of a portion of it, Mr. Albert Gray, M.R.A.S., gave an account to the Society, on June 20,\n1881. As already noticed, Mr. Gray has supplemented it by his translation, for the Ceylon Journal, of that part of Ibn Batuta's Voyages which refer to these Islands or to Ceylon. Mr. Gray has, also, treated on the same subject, in a paper printed in J.R.A.S., Vol. X. The whole report is worthy of perusal, but, probably, the most valuable parts are those relating to the Island-history (p. 21), which clearly show that the population, like the Sinhalese, are of Aryan descent, the actual language being nearly akin to the Elu or oldest form of Sinhalese. The grammar, however, has still to be written, and the only vocabularies, those of Pyrard (1602-7) and of Christopher (1836-8), are obviously very incomplete. Recently Mr. Gray has done something in this direction (J.R.A.S. Vol. X. 1878). Dr. E. M\u00fcller has given Contributions to Sinhalese Grammar in the Ceylon Sess. Papers for 1880, and Prof. Kuhn a paper in the Munich Sitzungsberichte, which Mr. Ferguson has translated for the Indian Antiquary. The old characters, now disused, bear some resemblance to the Vattelutta or Old Tamil. The new characters, called Gubuli-tana, are peculiar and probably unique in their composition. Mr. Gray states that the first letters are merely the Arabic numerals from 1 to 9, and the last letters probably simplifications of the old alphabet (see p. 78 for one of native writing). Mr. Bell adds a valuable Note on the Money, Weights, and Measures used in these Islands.\n\nIn the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society (vol. lii. pt. 1, No. 2), Rajendralala Mitra has a long article, \"On the Temples of Deoghar,\" a subject previously noticed in Hunter's \"Annals of Rural Bengal,\" and in other publications: none of these, however, give an adequate idea of the inscriptions found there. No temple in India would seem to have a higher claim for sanctity than that of Baidyunatha, at Deoghar, more than 100,000 pilgrims visiting it (we are told) yearly. The name Deoghar is probably\nThe temple of Vaidyanatha now stands in the middle of the town, surrounded by a court-yard of an irregular quadrilateral form. The presiding divinity is the Jyotirlinga, of cylindrical form, five inches in diameter, and rising about four inches from the centre of a large slab of basalt, shaped like a yoni and pointing to the north. Rajendra Mitra criticizes with some severity Mr. Beglar's descriptions of this building (Arch. Survey, vol. viii.), but Mr. Beglar's measures are probably correct. Curiously, in the Temple court-yard there is still a monument of a much earlier period, a masonry platform, about six feet in height and twenty feet square, supporting three huge monoliths of contorted gneiss rock, two of them vertical, the third lying upon the heads of the two uprights, like a horizontal beam. R. Mitra thinks this structure is a Hindu \"Dolkat-frame\" in stone, and that it was erected for the purpose of swinging Krishna in the Holi Festival. Mr. Beglar, on the other hand, holds it to be simply a great gateway. The Babu then gives a full transcript and translation of all the inscriptions, which are modern and of little interest; indeed, of so little, that one wonders that so many pages of the Journal should have been given to them. It may be added that, admitting all the sacred buildings now remaining at Deoghar to be modern, there is strong reason for believing that they represent others of a much earlier date. This, however, R. Mitra doubts.\n\nIn vol. lii. part i. No. 3, Mr. Rivett-Carnac has given a very interesting account, illustrated by three plates, of his recent researches in company with Mr. J. Cockburn, in the Banda District of the North-West Provinces, on Stone Monuments, etc., the majority of which are clearly the remains of the Aboriginal Tribes of India, who,\n\n1 An account of these temples, with a more correct plan than that of Rajendra Mitra, was published by Mr. Beglar (Cunningham, vol. viii. p. 37, pt. 9 and 10), but none of these accounts furnish any illustration from which the style and age of these temples can be satisfactorily determined.\ndriven out of the fertile Delta, on the Hindu invasion from the north, found a natural refuge in the hills and the jungle. Over the vast jungle tract of Central India, cromlechs, kistvaens, and circles, closely resembling those found in Britain and on the Continent of Europe, are to be met with. None of the implements found among these older remains appear to be in use at the present day even among the most uncivilized of the existing tribes. Indeed, the uncultivated natives, generally, look on them as wonderful and mysterious, often as holy. The village pipal tree is the surest place near which to find them. There the villagers, acting unconsciously as valuable coadjutors in the interest of archaeological research, have collected together and piled up from time immemorial these curious relics of a bygone age, preserving them with that mysterious awe which attaches in their eyes to everything that is old and rare. Messrs. Carnac and Cockburn have collected many hundreds of these monuments, of all sizes and types, many of them, from their weather-worn surfaces, evidently of great age. For the purpose of classification, they have divided them into\u2014\n\n1. Hammer Stones. 2. Celts. The specimens from both of these classes so closely resemble those that have been found in the west, that had they not been carefully marked, their provenance could not have been determined. It should be added, that the best specimens procured have been placed in the British Museum, while casts of those that seemed to be unique have been sent to the chief museums of Europe, America, and the Indian Presidency towns. In the Proceedings for June, 1883, Mr. Rivett-Carnac has, also, given some important Notes on the Cromlech of Er-Lannig in the Gulf of Morbihan. With the view of comparing what he and Mr. Cockburn had found in India, Mr. Carnac wrote to different people in Europe, and at length received a letter in reply from Comte de Limar, whose collection at Vannes, is the most complete existing.\nOf Mr. Carnac's collection the Comte remarks, \"I have been struck with the extraordinary similarity existing between the Celts you have so kindly sent me and our own types. Had I not put marks on them, it would have been impossible to distinguish yours from those in my collection here.\"\n\nMr. Beames, in his \"Notes on Orissa,\" has brought together much antiquarian history, the chief point being the evidence he has adduced, that the Oriya race cannot, as some have supposed, be an offshoot from Bengal, their settlement in this district being (as shown from the character of their language) antecedent to the existence of any settled population in Bengal. The ancient sovereigns of Orissa were, he shows, great builders of stone buildings, and their monuments still abound to such an extent that it is surprising that General Cunningham has not devoted any of his Archaeological researches to a part of India which would well repay him for such trouble. From about A.D. 1450, the records of the province are clear, and can be corroborated from various testimonies. Indeed, from the Temple Records at Puri, Messrs. Stirling and Hunter extracted a good deal of history, more or less exact, extending to the foundation of the Kesari Dynasty (A.D. 504). Asoka's Inscriptions in the Caves carry back the history to B.C. 250. Mr. Beames's History of Balasore, we may add, is carefully worked out.\n\nGeneral Cunningham contributes a third paper (with one plate), containing a further account of the \"Relics from Ancient Persia in Gold, Silver and Copper.\" The principal object is a gold cylinder, superior, he thinks, in workmanship, to any Persian gems he has seen, a judgment which the plate given scarcely confirms. There are two scenes represented on it, each illustrative of the same subject, that of a Persian soldier or chief slaying a prisoner. General Cunningham considers the enemies to be Scythians, as they wear the dress described by Herod. vii. 64; and, further, that the two\ncaptives and the three slain figures are Indians, as these persons wear the dhoti and buskins. This cylinder weighs 1520 grains, and is intrinsically worth 175 rupees (say \u00a316). The second gold object is a circular disk of about the same weight and value, representing a man riding on a lion-headed Hippocamp, similar forms of which mythical animal occur on the Buddhist rails at Buddha Gaya (Arch. Survey, vol. iii. p. 29). The third represents an antelope in the act of leaping, weighs 3020 grains, and is worth 350 rupees (or \u00a331). Gen. Cunningham suggests that this object may have been the top of a staff, as there is a hole under the stomach for the insertion of the stick.\n\nMr. F. S. Growse contributes an interesting paper, \"On the Town of Bulandshahr (N.W. Provinces),\" where, in the course of some necessary excavations, he lighted upon scores of \"strange earthenware flasks or vase-like objects,\" which would seem to have been a special local manufacture. Mr. Growse is inclined to think, as the place was evidently one of importance in Buddhist times, \"that they were manufactured to serve as finials for miniature Buddhist Stupas.\" A Buddha has been dug up on the spot, having on each side of his throne a rampant hippocriff with its back to the sage, and rearing its head over a devotee seated in the attitude of prayer. There is also a Buddhist inscription of the ninth or tenth century. A terra-cotta seal was also found, bearing the name \"Mattila,\" in characters of the fifth century. Mr. Growse adds an account of a copper-plate grant which was found at M\u00e2npur, near Bulandshahr, in 1867, and has been published in the J.B.A.S. vol. xxxviii., its date being A.D. 1076 or 1176.\n\nTwo important works have been recently published in Calcutta, viz. the first and second volume of a \"Catalogue and Handbook of the Archaeological Collections in the Indian Museum\" there, drawn up by its able superintendent Dr. John Anderson, M.R.A.S. The first part is devoted to the\nAsoka and Indo-Scythian Galleries, and comprises a very full and careful account of such portions of these ancient monuments as are now preserved in the Museum at Calcutta.\n\nThe chief objects are the Asoka Gallery, the Gateway and Railings of the Bharhut Stupa; many fragments from Buddha Gaya; Casts from the friezes of the Rock-cut Temples of Orissa, showing that the people who executed these works were nearly contemporary with the workmen of the Bharhut railings, the caves themselves being essentially Buddhist in character and not far from the city of Dantapuri (or Puri), where, as the name implies, one of the relics of Buddha (a tooth) was enshrined. The date of these sculptures is admitted to be between 250 B.C. and 100 B.C., a determination supported by the fact that at Dhauli, a few miles distant, we still find some of King Asoka's inscriptions on the Aswatama rocks, with an inscription of Kharaveli, dated B.C. 146 (see paper by Bhagvanlal Indraji, read at the Leyden Congress).\n\nFrom Patna and from Sanchi the Museum has, also, received many valuable monuments, about some of which, as notably the two statues said to have been procured many years since by Mr. J. Tytler, there is a curious difference between General Cunningham's notice in the fifteenth volume of his Archaeological Survey, and that now communicated, with the objects before him, by Dr. Anderson. The details of these differences of description are too long for insertion here, but they will be found by those who care to study them in the Archaeological Survey of India, vol. xv. p. 1, and in Dr. Anderson's work, vol. i. p. 151.\n\nThe Sanchi Stupas consist of a series of Buddhist monuments discovered at various sites between the towns of Bhilsa and Bhopal, in Central India. The rest of this volume is devoted to the Indo-Scythic gallery, with its valuable collec-\ntions from Mathura, Amravati, Gandhara, Buddha Gaya, and other famous sites.\n\nDr. Anderson's second volume is devoted to a detailed account of the Gupta and Inscription Galleries, including Buddhist, Jain, Brahmanical, and Muhammadan sculptures, metal weapons, objects from tumuli, etc. This is quite as carefully drawn up as the preceding one, and of great value as an authentic record of what the Indian Museum at Calcutta possessed in 1882. Some useful information is given in various Appendices: thus, Mr. F. R. Mallet gives analyses of various metallic objects, and Mr. H. B. Medlicott the geological character of the various rocks, out of which many of the ancient sculptures in the Museum have been carved.\n\nOf miscellaneous archaeological papers may be mentioned: a notice by Dr. A. L\u00f6wy, in Proc. Bibl. Arch\u00e6ol. Soc. June, On Underground Structures in Biblical lands:\u2014an interesting account, in the Academy for June, p. 448, of some enamelled glass lamps obtained by Mr. S. L. Poole, on loan for the South Kensington Museum, from the Khedive himself:\u2014in the same Journal for August, p. 101, a sketch by J. H. Middleton of the \"St. Maurice Collection of Arab Art.\" The Academy, also, has (Feb. 16, p. 117) an important letter from Prof. Peterson, On a fixed date in Indian Chronology: \u2014 and, in April, 1884, p. 265, an appreciative review by Mr. W. Simpson, of Messrs. Fergusson and Burgess' Cave Temples (2 vols. 1882).\n\nIn the Revue Critique, No. 37, M. Clermont Ganneau has given some useful \"Notes d'Arch\u00e9ologie Orientale.\"\n\nMajor Raverty has continued in his Fourth Section his valuable \"Notes on Afghanistan and part of Baluchistan,\" and in his routes\u2014seventy-three to ninety\u2014has given a marvellous collection of miscellaneous matter of all kinds, linguistic, antiquarian, etc., bearing on the past and present history of the peoples he describes. It is impossible to\nanalyze a work of this kind; but one thing is sadly absent, viz. a good map, but this may be, perhaps, hereafter supplied. Major Raverty's notes throughout show great knowledge of the native writers to whom he refers, but it would have been wiser had these notes been a little less hostile to every one who happens to differ from him.\n\nIndian Antiquary.\u2014There is no falling off in the papers contributed to this useful periodical, and we find most of the contributors of past years continuing their valuable memoirs, with the aid of some new ones. Thus, omitting for the present the notices of inscriptions, which will come hereafter under the appropriate head of Epigraphy, it must be mentioned that Mr. Fleet has contributed a very important paper (Aug. Nov.) \"On the Nomenclature of the principal Hindu Eras and on the use of Samvatsara and its abbreviations,\" in which he contends that Samvatsara does not necessarily mean the era of Vikramaditya (as maintained by the late Prof. Dowson and Prof. Monier Williams)\u2014that Samvat is not an abbreviation of Samvatsara, but of the genitive plural Samvatsaranam \"of years,\"\u2014that Samvat is used to denote years of the Saka Era, though Prof. Dowson's restrictive meaning may be true for dates since the eleventh century A.D.,\u2014and, generally, that, when mentioned in connexion with the earlier Eras, Samvat is not to be considered as a declinable base, meaning \"era,\" but only as a technical abbreviation of Samvatsaranam. Mr. Fleet then gives abundant examples of this early usage. Other technical forms are Sakakala and Saka-samaya, \"the time of the Saka;\" \"Saka-varsha,\" Sak\u00e2da, Sakavatsara, etc., the years of the Sakas; finally, and last in chronological sequence, \"Salivahana-Suka,\" the Era of Salivahana, which was not, however, fully established till the time of the Vijayanagara Kings. Mr. Fleet then discusses at some length the Vikrama era, partly in reply to the objections\nurged by Prof. Max M\u00fcller in \"India, what can it teach us?\" pp. 282-283.\n\nDr. B\u00fchler has published two papers, the first, \"On the relationship between the Andhras and the Western Kshatrapas,\" in which, while supporting, generally, the discoveries of Pandit Bhagvanlal Indraji, he points out that some portion of the Pandit's remarks on the Chronology of the Andhras requires modification. In the second, he gives an interesting account of an ancient Royal Seal (in terra-cotta) found in Wala, which appears to record two names, not previously met with, viz. those of Ahivarman and Pushyena. The Editor also contributes two papers (August, December), in the first of which he gives, in Prof. F. Max M\u00fcller's own words, his views on the subject of the Vikramaditya Era, in which the Professor supports, generally, the proposals of the late Prof. Bhao Daji and Mr. Fergusson and adds a table; and though, as he says, some of the links of this chronological system are still doubtful, the possible existence of a Vikramaditya in the first century B.C. is suggested, while that of a king so named in the sixth century admits of little doubt. His second paper (December) contains an excellent account of the Ritual of Ramesvaram, one of the great temples of Southern India, the area of which, 865 feet (east to west) and 657 (north and south), or about $13\\frac{1}{2}$ acres, is considerably, therefore, in excess of that of the Great Pyramid. As a structure it is important, as the work of a period extending over 350 years. It was erected and is endowed almost solely by the Setupati Chiefs of Ramnad. The daily ritual is unusually long and complicated.\n\nProf. Bhandarkar, of Poona, has a paper, On the Rashtrakuta Kings, Krishnaraja and Elapura, in which he combats some previous translations, and suggests that the beautiful temple said to have been constructed on the hill at Elapur (Elur\u0101) is probably the Kail\u0101sa itself.\n\nTo R. F. Chisholm, Gov. Arch. Madras, we owe an im-\nportant notice of Chandragiri, in the N. Arkot district, which contains the old palace of Sri Ranga Raya, the last representative of the Vijayanara Dynasty, who gave the English their first foothold in India, by permitting them to erect Fort St. George at Madras, by his *sunnad* dated A.D. 1639. Four plates, containing elevations and plans of it, are given. The writer of the paper states that orders have been given by the Government of Madras for the renovation of this building, whatever this word of ill omen may mean.\n\nMr. W. Knight James (Jan. 1884) has a short paper, entitled Notes on Buddhist Images in Ceylon, which is useful, as showing the different attitudes selected in that Island for Buddha and his attendants. It may be noted that in Ceylon Buddha and his disciples do not wear ornaments or a head-dress, while, on the other hand, Buddha's head is usually surrounded by a flame-like process intended to serve as a sort of halo. In some paintings this halo surrounds the whole body. The Rev. T. Foulkes gives, also, a paper on a Grant of the Bana King Vikramaditya II., which is valuable for the chronology of an ancient Dynasty of South Dekkan Kings.\n\nThere is, also (Jun. 1884), a very important notice by Prof. B\u00fchlcr, of Prof. Peterson's account in the Bombay Journal of his search for Sanskrit MSS. In that for April, is an important paper, by Mr. K. T. Telang, \"On the Date of Sankaracharya,\" in which he controverts some of the views of Prof. F. Max M\u00fcller.\n\n*Semitic Literature\u2014Hebrew and Chaldee.\u2014Many valuable papers have appeared in different periodicals since the last Anniversary, some of which will now be noticed. Thus, in the Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, June 5, is a short but interesting speculation by Professor*\nSayce on the meaning of the Biblical names Shem and Japhet:\u2014by Mr. H. Rassam, \u201cOn Biblical Nationalities Past and Present\u201d:\u2014by Mr. Chotzner (Jan. 8, 1884), On Hebrew Poetry, in which he attempts to maintain the old hexametrical system against the more modern and more generally received view of parallelism:\u2014and by Dr. S. Louis, \u201cOn the Handicrafts and Artizans mentioned in the Talmudical Writings:\u201d\u2014in April 1, is a notice by the same writer \u201cOn the Life and Social Position of Hebrew Women in Biblical Times:\u201d\u2014and a paper by the Rev. A. L\u00f6wy \u201cOn Technological Terms in Ancient Semitic Culture and Folklore.\u201d To the Transactions of the Society (vol. viii. part 1) Dr. Louis has, also, contributed a paper of much interest, On the Poor-Laws of the Ancient Hebrews.\n\nIn the Athen\u00e6um (1883, Aug. 25) is a notice of the Rev. W. H. Lowe\u2019s masterly edition of the Mishnah from the unique MS. at Cambridge, the text of which is believed to be nearer to that found in the editions of the Jerusalem Talmud than that of the Babylonian Talmud, a question which has been already fully discussed by Dr. Schiller-Szinessy in a monograph entitled \u201cVhemah Bakk\u2019thubim.\u201d The better readings of the Cambridge MS. are everywhere conscientiously pointed out by Mr. Lowe. In Sept. 15 is an excellent notice of the \u201cThree Rabbis,\u201d who, the writer justly says, have left a durable impression on the Jews, even long after they had lost the last shadow of political life, on the fall of Jerusalem. These were R. Aqiba, his pupil R. Meir, and R. Judah, the final redactor of the Mishnah. The general story of R. Meir, who was certainly a remarkable man in his day, will be found clearly given in M. Raphael Levy\u2019s book, entitled \u201cUn Tanah, Etude sur la vie et l\u2019enseignement d\u2019un Docteur Juif du deuxi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle.\u201d The passages attributed to R. Meir, relating to Christian controversy, are, however, probably, apocryphal. Another book bearing on this subject is Dr. Joel\u2019s \u201cBlicke\nin die Religionsgeschichte,\u201d of which two parts only have as yet appeared. In Jan. 10, 1884, is a review of Mr. Bateson Wright\u2019s new and critically revised Translation of the Book of Job. In this work, a useful contribution to the study of a difficult book, its author is considered to be an Israelite.\n\nIn March 22 is an interesting account of Dr. Schiller-Szinessy\u2019s First Book of the Psalms, according to the text of the Cambridge MS. Bible, with the commentary of David Qimchi, the text of which he assigns to the ninth century, though most scholars think it is as late as the twelfth. From the Athen\u00e6um we also learn (Sept. 8, 1883) that Dr. Hoerning, of the Dept. of Orient. MSS., British Museum, has been engaged for some time in preparing for publication one of the most remarkable of the Karaite MSS. recently acquired, comprehending Exodus i. 1 to viii. 5, which will be represented by an autotype facsimile of the Hebrew text, etc., as written in this MS. in Arabic characters. M. Stasson, of St. Petersburg, is, we understand, about to publish in facsimile the earliest specimens of the Illuminated initials in Biblical MSS., which are interesting from their evident connection with Byzantine art.\n\nIn the Academy, Dec. 29, is a review of Dr. Strack\u2019s Hebraische Grammatik, the first of the series of introductory manuals called \u201cPorta Linguarum Orientalium,\u201d a work excellently arranged, and the more useful from the considerable list of works bearing on the study of Hebrew appended to it. This volume, in fact, takes the place of the one published nearly forty years ago by J. H. Petermann. In March 1, 1884, is a good notice of the \u201cMonatschrift f\u00fcr Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judenthums,\u201d showing how much is being done by Jewish scholars for history and philology, and calling attention to many excellent papers by such scholars as Drs. Eggers, Graetz, and Backer.\n\nIn the Revue Critique (Nos. xli. and xlii.), M. Hal\u00e9vy\nreviews at length, and with high commendation, Prof. Dillmann's Kurzgefasstes Exegetisches Handbuch zum Alten Testament, ninth Lieferung. Die Genesis, and gives a very interesting sketch of the course of modern criticism as applied to the Pentateuch. In a second paper (No. xlii.), the same scholar treats with great severity M. Lenormant's \"La Gen\u00e8se.\" In No. xlvii. M. Hal\u00e9vy, further, notices, approvingly, the recent work of M. Paul de Lagarde, entitled \"S\u00e8pher Takhem\u00f4ni,\" a collection of poems by Juda Harizi, a celebrated poet of Toledo, in the twelfth century, framed on Hispano-Arabian models of two centuries earlier. Harizi seems to have been at the head of the best school of the Hebrew Renaissance.\n\nIn the Zeitschrift d. Morg. Gesellschaft, xxxvii. pt. 2, M. D. Kaufmann notices Saadja Alfajjumi, and there is also a brief account of Abu'l Walid Ibn Ganah und die Neu-Hebraische Poesie: M. Kautsch adds a \"Bericht \u00fcber die 1881 ausgebiete d. Hebr. Sprache.\" In part 3 Dr. W. Bacher writes on the Hebrew \u05d0 and the Arabic \u0621; and Dr. Imm. Low reviews M. Zuckernackel's Tosefta. In part 4 Prof. N\u00f6ldeke has a paper entitled \"Untersuchungen zur Semitischen Grammatik\" I. Die Verba in \u05d9 im Hebraisches. Other brief notices of books recently published will be found in the Deutsch Literaturzeitung, in the Deutsch Central-blatt, in the Theolog. Literaturzeitung, and in the G\u00f6tting. Gelehrte Anzeigen. The \"Literatur-Blatt f\u00fcr Orientalische Philologie,\" which started in last October, and promises well, has not as yet printed (in the three numbers now out) anything on Hebrew Literature. On the other hand, the Revue des Etudes Juives is full of interesting articles by such scholars as MM. Joseph and Hartwig Derenbourg, Friedl\u00e4nder, Bacher, Israel Levi, Jastrow, Isidore Loeb and the late M. Lenormant. In America, at Chicago, a monthly journal has been started, for Old Testament literature and interpretation, under the auspices of the American Institute\nof Hebrew, and the American Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis has continued its useful labours.\n\nAmong miscellaneous books, the following may be noted,\u2014to quote all would fill many pages: Delitzsch, F., The Hebrew Language viewed in the light of Assyrian Research:\u2014Straschun, D. O., Der Traktat Taanit d. Bab. Talmud:\u2014Fischer, B., Talmudische Chrestomathie:\u2014Dr. W\u00fcnsche's Bibliotheca Rabbinica 26th sect. entitled, \"Der Midrasch Wajjika Rabba\":\u2014Brooks, W. H. S., Vestiges of the Broken Plural in Hebrew:\u2014Gesenius, Hebr. W\u00f6rterbuch, fasc. 9:\u2014Levy, Neu-Hebr. W\u00f6rterbuch, fasc. 16:\u2014Nathan, Lexicon Targum, Talmud et Midrash (cur\u00e0 Kohut) tom. iii.-iv.:\u2014Rabinowicz, Variae lectiones in Talmud, etc., pt. xiii.:\u2014Schwab, M., Le Talmud de Jerusalem, tom. vi.:\u2014Delitzsch, F., The Hebrew New Testament of the British and Foreign Bible Society (new edition):\u2014Graetz, Hist. des Juifs, trad. par M. Wogue, tom. i.:\u2014W\u00fcnsche, Dr. A., Der Midrasch Ruth Rabba.\n\nAssyrian, etc.\u2014Before the Society of Biblical Archaeology, many valuable papers have been read, and some of them since published, in either their \"Proceedings\" or \"Transactions.\" Thus, in their \"Proceedings\" (May, 1883, p. 120), Mr. J. P. Peters contributes a letter on Mr. Pinches' paper of June 6, 1882, \"On Akkadian Numerals\":\u2014M. Jules Oppert, a letter to Mr. W. H. Rylands on some of Mr. Pinches' replies (p. 152):\u2014on Nov. 6, Mr. E. A. Budge read a paper, \"On the Fourth Tablet of the Creation Series, relating to the fight between Marduk and Tiam-at,\" from a tablet found by Mr. Rassam (1883, p. 5): and Mr. Pinches one, \"On Babylonian Art illustrated by Mr. Rassam's latest discoveries,\" the most important of these being an egg-shaped object in marble, bearing a dedication by Sargon of Agade, presumed to be as early as b.c. 3800 (p. 11):\u2014Prof. Sayce contributed a letter \"On the Cuneiform Tablets\nof Cappadokia\u201d (p. 17). In p. 34 is a further letter from M. Jules Oppert, with a reply from Mr. Pinches:\u2014Mr. Pinches also gives \u201cNotes on the Sardu-bird or Falcon\u201d (p. 57), and continues his \u201cPapers on Assyrian Grammar,\u201d dealing in this one with \u201cThe Permansive and other forms\u201d (p. 62):\u2014Mr. W. H. Rylands adds (p. 68) an excellent drawing of the famous Cylinder of Sargon, described by Mr. Pinches. On Feb. 5, Mr. Bertin read a paper entitled \u201cNotes on the Babylonian Contract Tables\u201d (p. 84), his chief point being that these documents are mercantile rather than legal; and M. Menant replied to Mr. Pinches\u2019 paper \u201cOn Babylonian Art\u201d (p. 88). In p. 102, Mr. Pinches prints a paper \u201cOn the sale of a Slave, marked on the left hand with the name of his mistress\u201d:\u2014and, later on, at p. 107, replies to M. Menant. On March 4, a joint paper by Messrs. Pinches and Budge, \u201cOn an Edict of Nebuchadnezzar I., about b.c. 1150,\u201d was read by the Secretary (p. 119), and, at p. 125, Messrs. Bertin, Pinches, and Budge propose what they call \u201ca rational system of transliteration\u201d for certain Assyrian syllables. In the \u201cTransactions\u201d of the same Society, vol. viii. p. 1, is a valuable and admirably-illustrated paper, \u201cOn the Birds of the Assyrian Monuments and Records,\u201d by the Rev. W. Houghton (pp. 92\u2013142); and, in vol. viii. pt. 2, two papers by Mr. Pinches, viz. \u201cThe Antiquities found by Mr. Rassam at Abu-Habbah (Siffara),\u201d pp. 164\u2013171, and \u201cBabylonian Legal Documents referring to House Property and the Law of Inheritance,\u201d pp. 271\u2013298: there is, also, one by Mr. Bertin, \u201cAkkadian Precepts for the conduct of man in his private life,\u201d pp. 230\u2013279; and one by Mr. Hormuzd Rassam, \u201cRecent Discoveries of Ancient Babylonian Cities,\u201d pp. 172\u2013197.\n\nIn the Athen\u00e6um (June 2, p. 700), Mr. Pinches writes on the word Khabatsillatu, and, subsequently, in pp. 729, 763, and 795, is a personal discussion, between Messrs. Delitzsch and Pinches, to which we can only allude. Mr. Lelitzsch,\nin pp. 763, 792, 114, and 239, adds four more papers on the \"Importance of Assyriology to Hebrew Lexicography.\" These and the earlier ones have now been reprinted in a single volume. We further learn, from the same Journal, that the fuller examination of the Babylonian Tablets from Abu Habba shows that they were originally arranged in chronological order.\n\nIn the Academy (Sept. 1) Mr. E. A. Budge gives an account of a cylinder (one of Mr. Rassam's discoveries) of Antiochus, with the date of B.C. 270-269, on which also occur the names of Seleucus and Stratonice. It is one of the latest known. In Oct. 6, Mr. Budge announces the discovery that some forger has been attempting to imitate (in clay and plaster of Paris mixed) some of the so-called \"contract\" tablets. The forger's work appears to have been done in rather a bungling fashion, but might, perhaps, deceive uncritical or unpractised eyes.\n\nIn Sept. 1, M. Terrien de Lacouperie has printed a paper on \"The Affinity of the Ten Stems of the Chinese Cycle with the Akkadian Numerals.\" And in Oct. 6, the same writer deals, at great length, with his favourite subject, the connexion, in prehistoric times, of China and Babylon, and formulates his discovery in the following words: \"The Chinese mythical list of kings,\" he says, \"is based on the early Babylonian Canon, and reproduces the first eighty-six kings mentioned by Berosus, as well as many legends and historical facts of the same period.\" In Nov. 14 Professor Sayce maintains that M. de Lacouperie's objection to the received date of Sargon of Akkad is not sound, as the kings mentioned in the Babylonian list are there stated to be not arranged in chronological order. In Dec. 22, the same writer further notices several works bearing on Assyriology. The first by Mr. Evans (\"An Essay on Assyriology\"), written at the request of the Hibbert Trustees, gives the chief and latest results of\net la transcription de la chuintante et de la sifflante en Assyrien:\u2014by F. Hommel, Zur Alt-Babylonischen Chronologie:\u2014and by J. Oppert, Un acte de vente conserv\u00e9 en deux exemplaires:\u2014with some other short notes and reviews.\n\nBefore the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et de Belles Lettres (May 18) M. Oppert has given a further account of the Cuneiform monuments in the Vatican, and has noted among them, some fragments of sculpture (an arm and part of a head), and a contract tablet of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, dated July, 575 B.C. (Aug. 3) M. Schwab gives a decipherment of a Chaldaean inscription on terra-cotta, found at Hillah and now in the British Museum, which he attributes to the sixth century B.C. (Aug. 31) M. Ledrain communicates two Sumerian texts, one engraved on a piece of black diorite, the other on a statue, most probably the so-called King Goudea. (Sept. 7) M. Oppert deals with certain ancient Chaldaean linear measurements which have been detected on statues of the aforenamed king, and calculates their value according to the French system. In Sept. 14 M. Ledrain gives the translation of another Sumerian inscription from a statue of the same king, relating to the building by him of a brick temple. (Oct. 12) M. Hal\u00e9vy gives an explanation of certain Hebrew and Assyrian words, and, especially, of the word El \u201cGod,\u201d by El \u201ccolumn.\u201d (Dec. 28) M. Barbier de Meynard states that M. Pognon has found in the Wady Brissa (Lebanon) two Cuneiform Inscriptions, each accompanied with a bas-relief, one in Arabic characters, the other in cursive. They are much defaced, but give a list of Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s buildings at Babylon; and (Jan. 4, 1884) M. Oppert gives some notes on them. M. Heuzey (Feb. 15) announces the discovery of the name of a new king of Tello, which, according to M. Oppert\u2019s system of decipherment, will read Souh-ka-ghi-na. The inscription would seem to be one of the most ancient on record. The stone itself is\nThe Z.D.M.G. contains no notice of matters Assyrian.\n\nIn the Journal Asiatique, serie 8, tome 1, p. 261, M. Guyard has a brief \"Note sur quelques particularit\u00e9s des Inscriptions de Van\" (see above). At p. 515, M. Oppert announces some new discoveries, and, at p. 517, M. Guyard gives an account of some paper impressions of inscriptions from Van, made by M. Desrolle. In serie 8, tome 2, p. 81, M. Darmesteter (in his Annual Report) gives a summary of what has been done for Assyriology during the past year by French excavators and linguists. At p. 184, M. Guyard prints a paper entitled \"Nouvelles Notes de Lexicographie Assyrienne.\" At p. 351, M. Pognon publishes \"Inscription de M\u00e9rou-N\u00e9rar I., Roi d'Assyrie,\" and an \"Inscription in\u00e9dite du British Museum.\" The text of the former inscription has been printed in the British Museum Series, vol. iv. pl. 44-5.\n\nIn the Revue Critique (No. 29) is a review by M. Hal\u00e9vy of the new edition of Schrader's \"Die Keil-Inschriften und das Alte Testament,\" in which the reviewer naturally complains of the writer's advocacy of the Sumerian or Akkadian theories, and, in the Deutsch Literaturzeitung, the Centralblatt, and Theologisch Literaturzeitung, are brief, and generally good, notices of the principal recent Assyrian publications.\n\nAt the meeting of the American Oriental Society (Boston, May, 1883), Prof. W. D. Whitney read a paper entitled, \"Was there at the head of the Babylonian Pantheon, a Deity bearing the name of El?\" In the Literatur-Blatt d. Orient. Philol., pt. 4, Mr. Schrader speaks very highly of Bezold's \"Keilschrift-typen d. Akad. zu M\u00fcnchen,\" and, in the new \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Keilschriftforschung,\" the first number of which was published in January of the present year, are the following papers:\u2014By E. Schrader, Zur Frage nach der Aussprache der Zisch-laute in Babyl-Assyrischen:\u2014by Prof. Sayce, On the origin of the Persian Cuneiform Alphabet:\u2014by Stanislas Guyard, Quelques remarques sur la prononciation\net la transcription de la chuintante et de la sifflante en Assyrien:\u2014by F.

Hal\u00e9vy gives an explanation of certain Hebrew and Assyrian words, and, especially, of the word El \u201cGod,\u201d by El \u201ccolumn.\u201d (Dec. 28) M. Barbier de Meynard states that M. Pognon has found in the Wady Brissa (Lebanon) two Cuneiform Inscriptions, each accompanied with a bas-relief, one in Arabic characters, the other in cursive. They are much defaced, but give a list of Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s buildings at Babylon; and (Jan. 4, 1884) M. Oppert gives some notes on them. M. Heuzey (Feb. 15) announces the discovery of the name of a new king of Tello, which, according to M. Oppert\u2019s system of decipherment, will read Souh-ka-ghi-na. The inscription would seem to be one of the most ancient on record. The stone itself is\nlost, but the inscription has been preserved on one of M. de Sarzec's paper impressions. M. Oppert (Feb. 29) expresses his opinion that the Prince, to whom the inscription belonged, must have reigned before Sargon and Naramsin, and, therefore, before B.C. 3800.\n\nIn the Journal des Savants, Nov. 1883, is an important paper \"Sur la p\u00e9riode Chaldaique,\" which appears to have been originally drawn up (but not quite finished) by the well-known astronomer, M. Biot. It has now been printed under the editing of M. Lefort.\n\nLastly, in the Times for Oct. 4 is a very interesting and complete resum\u00e9 of the Collection of the Chaldean Antiquities mainly procured by M. de Sarzec (the French Consul at Bassorah) and now in the Louvre. These antiquities have been chiefly found in some mounds, called by the Arabs Tel-lo, or the \"Mound of the Idol,\" this name having been derived from a statue in black granite, which long lay uninjured on the surface of the ground, but has now been broken up and its fragments distributed as \"antikas\" among different European Museums. Unfortunately, Mr. George Smith considered this mound beyond the limit of his firm, so it has been left for M. de Sarzec to secure for France, what might otherwise have been appropriately added to the collections of the British Museum. Tel-lo occupies the site of the city of Sergulla, which was ruled in remote times by Viceroys subject to the rulers of Ur; and its ancient name still survives in the Arab Zerghoul. According to Dr. Delitzsch it had another name, Kul-una, not improbably the Calneh of Gen. x. 10. The monuments recovered open a vista of Babylonian primitive life, at a period little short of 4000 years B.C. The statue of one of the most important of the Viceroys, Goudoa, represents him in his character of Priest-Architect. One of his seals is preserved in the Museum at the Hague.\n\nAmong the books or essays published during the last year,\nmay be noted the following.

However, to take the last first: in the Athen\u00e6um, June 30, is an interesting notice of Mr. Stanley Lane Poole\u2019s \u201cStudies in a Mosque,\u201d a work of much miscellaneous value, with a title, however, which would certainly be misleading to ordinary readers:\u2014in Aug. 25, is a very full review of Sir W. Muir\u2019s \u201cAnnals of the Early Caliphate from Original Sources,\u201d with a suggestion that\nsome of the dates he has given cannot be quite maintained, to which Sir W. Muir has replied, in Sept. 29. We learn also, from the same Journal, that Prof. A. M\u00fcller is preparing a Handbook to Arabic Literature, from the papers left behind him by the late Prof. O. Loth.\n\nIn the Academy, Jan. 12, 1884, is a notice of Prof. Dietrici's Abhandlungen der Ichwan-es-Safa, containing part of the text of the tracts of \"The Brotherhood of Purity,\" from which, during the last twenty years, the Professor has been, from time to time, publishing translations. These fifty treatises profess to form a sort of Encyclop\u00e6dia of Philosophy, as the term was understood in the tenth century, and are the most interesting specimens of Arab thought we possess before Avicenna and Averroes. Mr. Poole has given, in his \"Studies in a Mosque,\" a summary of the Professor's translations. There is also, in March 8, a short notice of Van den Berg's Minhadj-at-talibin, a manual of Muhammadan jurisprudence, well worthy the attention of Europeans preparing for careers in the Far East. It is the law-book most generally in use in the Indian Archipelago and in Egypt.\n\nIn the Times of Sept. 12, 1883, is a valuable article on Arabic Grammar, too long, however, to be more than referred to here. It may, however, be noted that the writer calls attention to a fact not generally borne in mind, that Semitic grammar is an Arabic invention, derived from the necessity of establishing the Kor\u00e0n, not only as a religious code, but as the model of the Arabic official language, and that the first Hebrew grammars of the ninth or tenth century were simply imitations of the Arabic.\n\nFrom the Revue Critique, May, we learn that the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique has just published the fifth edition of the \"Pr\u00e9cis de Jurisprudence Musulmane de Sidi Khalil\"; and that the Baron de Rosen has printed at St. Petersburg, under the\ncompiled, may be noted Dr. Payne Smith's Thesaurus, which has reached its sixth fasciculus:\u2014Whish, H. F., Clavis Syriaca, a key to the Ancient Syriac Version;\u2014and Ceriani, A. M., Translatio Syra-Pescitto Vet. Testament, tom. ii. p. 4.\n\nIn the Revue Critique, May 21, M. Clermont Ganneau has a curious paper, \"Sur le Dieu Sed.\" In the Liter. Centr. Blatt., Oct. 1, is a notice of Macke's Ephrem der Syrer.\n\n\u00c6thiopic.\u2014In the Academy (July, 1883) is an interesting account of \"The Book of Adam and Eve\" (noticed in last year's report) translated from the \u00c6thiopic by the Rev. S. C. Malan, a work probably of the sixth or seventh century. Till recently this work was only known from the \u00c6thiopic, but, two years ago, Dr. Trumpp discovered at Munich a MS. of the Arabic original, and published, in 1881, the \u00c6thiopic text, in the Trans. of the Bav. Acad. of Sciences. The story is evidently derived from the floating body of legend, etc., current during the early years of Christianity.\n\nIn the Z. D. M. G. Dr. Pr\u00e6torius has given a paper on Tigrina Spr\u00fcchworter (xxxvii. p. 433):\u2014M. Rohlf's has also printed \"Meine Mission nach Abessinien\":\u2014and a new edition has been issued of the \"Book of Enoch the Prophet,\" transl. long since by Archbp. Lawrence, from a MS. in the Bodleian Library:\u2014M. Zotenberg has also reprinted, from the Journal Asiatique, the Chronique de Jean \u00c9v\u00eaque de Nikiou, which has been reviewed in the G\u00f6ttingen Gel. Anzeigen for Nov. 12.\n\nAryan Languages.\u2014Sanscrit.\u2014Many valuable reviews, essays, and books have appeared during the past year. Thus, in the Journal of this Society, Vol. XVI. Pt. 1, the Rev. B. Hale Wortham has published \"The Story of Devasmit\u00e2, transl. from the Kath\u00e2 Sarit S\u00e2gara\":\u2014From the Proc. of the Beng. As. Society (Nov. 1883) we learn that\n\"Catalogue des MSS. et imprim\u00e9s Arabes appartenant \u00e0 diverses biblioth\u00e8ques Musulmanes de Damas,\" which was drawn up, some thirteen years ago, by a learned Musulman of Jerusalem, Yusuf Al Khaldy. In (Jan. 1884) M. B. de Meynard prints a letter from M. Houdas of Algiers on the Tohfat of Ibn A\u00e7em, with the view of fixing the notation and pronunciation of the words in it; and in the same number, M. Hal\u00e9vy publishes \"Observations sur les Inscriptions Sab\u00e9ennes,\" with reference to the article by MM. Joseph and Hartwig Derenbourg in the last number of the Journ. Asiat., called \"Etudes sur l'Epigraphie du Yemen.\"\n\nIn the Z. D. M. G. Professor A. Socin deals with \"Der Arabische Dialekt von M\u00f4sul und Mardin\" (xxxvii. p. 188). Dr. Steinschneider has a paper on \"Die Parva Naturalia des Aristoteles bei dem Arabern\" (p. 477). M. Ahlwardt reviews Dieterici's Sogenannte Theologie des Aristoteles (p. 594), and Thorbecke, Dr. G. Jahn's Ibu Jais (p. 609).\n\nIn the Proc. of the American Or. Soc. (Oct. 1883, p. xv) is an interesting paper by Prof. I. H. Hall, on the Arabic Bible of Drs. Eli Smith and Cornelius Y. A. Van Dyck.\n\nIn the Literaturblatt f. Or. Philol. M. Praetorius writes on the Sab\u00e4ische Denkm\u00e4ler of MM. Mordtmann and M\u00fcller (p. 27); Thorbecke on A. Huber's Ueber das \"Meisir\" genannte Spiel der heidnischen Araber; M. Robles writes an interesting letter \"On Arabic Studies in Spain,\" p. 68; and Prof. Thorbecke deals with M. Ahlwardt's \"Anonyme Arabische Chronik, p. 153.\n\nOf books or papers published during the last year, the following may be noticed as the most important:\u2014Muir, Sir W., Annals of the Caliphate:\u2014Lane, E. W., Arabic-Engl. Dict., edited by S. L. Poole, vol. vii. pt. 3:\u2014Marten, J.

Of the Annals of Tabari, have been published ser. ii. pt. 2, ser. iii. pt. 5; and of Codera, Bibl. Arab. Hispana, vol. ii. pt. 1. The portion of the former, now published, concludes, with the Khalifat of M\u00f4tasim and of Wathiq billah, edited by Prof. de Goeje; and commences with that of Mutawakkil, edited by Prof. De Rosen. It may be added here, what, indeed, all scholars will rejoice to learn, viz. that the famous collection of 600 Arabic MSS., brought together by the zeal of the well-known publisher, M. Brill, has been purchased by the Dutch Government, and placed in the University Library at Leyden. Dr. Landberg has drawn up a catalogue of them, from which it is clear that many are very rare, some altogether unique.\nSyriac.\u2014In the Z. D. M. G. xxxvii. p. 293, Prof. Guidi, of Rome, has published an important paper entitled \"Beitr\u00e4ge zur Kenntniss des Neu-Aramischen Fellih\u00ee-Dialectes,\" and, in the Abhandlungen of the same Journal (bd. viii. No. 3), Dr. Baethgen has published, Fragmente Syrischer und Arabischer Historiker, Leipzig, 1884, being chiefly the Syro-Arabic of Elias of Nisibis, who died A.D. 1046; and, in the American Soc. of Bibl. Literature, Prof. I. H. Hall has written a paper, On the Beirut Syriac Codex and the Syriac Apocalypse.\n\nIn the Academy (Feb. 2, 1884) is a notice that Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner, in conjunction with the Clarendon Press, are about to publish a previously unknown Syriac version of Kalila wa Dimna, under the editing of Dr. W. Wright, of Cambridge. As is well known, one of the many forms of the Sanskrit Panchatantra and Hitopadesa was translated into Pehlvi at an early period. This, again, gave rise, in the sixth century, to the Syriac translation, called Kalilag wa Dimnag, and, in the eighth century, to an Arabic translation by Abd-ullah ibn Al-Mukaffa. Prof. Guidi has already published an important work on this subject in his \"Studii sul Testo Arabo del libro di Calila e Dimna\": an unique MS. in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin, is the basis of Dr. Wright's work. In Sept. 15, p. 182, Mr. R. L. Bensly reviews at great length Dr. W. Wright's \"Chronicle of Joshua the Stylite,\" the leading subject of this Chronicle being the war between the Romans and the Persians A.D. 502-6. We learn, also, from the same Journal (Nov. 3), that Mr. E. A. Budge, of the British Museum, will shortly publish the Syriac text and translation of a curious life of Alexander the Great, of which there is a Greek version in the works of the Pseudo-Callisthenes. The Syriac MS. is called \"The History of Alexander the son of Philip, the Macedonian King of the Greeks,\" and the text will be compiled from two MSS., one in the Brit. Mus., and the other lent by the American Oriental Society. Of Syriac books, in progress or\ncompiled, may be noted Dr. Payne Smith's Thesaurus, which has reached its sixth fasciculus:\u2014Whish, H. F., Clavis Syriaca, a key to the Ancient Syriac Version;\u2014and Ceriani, A. M., Translatio Syra-Pescitto Vet. Testament, tom. ii. p. 4. In the Revue Critique, May 21, M. Clermont Ganneau has a curious paper, \"Sur le Dieu Sed.\" In the Liter. Centr. Blatt., Oct. 1, is a notice of Macke's Ephrem der Syrer.\n\n\u00c6thiopic.\u2014In the Academy (July, 1883) is an interesting account of \"The Book of Adam and Eve\" (noticed in last year's report) translated from the \u00c6thiopic by the Rev. S. C. Malan, a work probably of the sixth or seventh century. Till recently this work was only known from the \u00c6thiopic, but, two years ago, Dr. Trumpp discovered at Munich a MS. of the Arabic original, and published, in 1881, the \u00c6thiopic text, in the Trans. of the Bav.

Dr. Pr\u00e6torius has given a paper on Tigrina Spr\u00fcchworter (xxxvii. p. 433):\u2014M. Rohlfz has also printed \"Meine Mission nach Abessinien\":\u2014and a new edition has been issued of the \"Book of Enoch the Prophet,\" transl. long since by Archbp. Lawrence, from a MS. in the Bodleian Library:\u2014M. Zotenberg has also reprinted, from the Journal Asiatique, the Chronique de Jean \u00c9v\u00eaque de Nikiou, which has been reviewed in the G\u00f6ttingen Gel. Anzeigen for Nov. 12.\n\nAryan Languages.\u2014Sanskrit.\u2014Many valuable reviews, essays, and books have appeared during the past year. Thus, in the Journal of this Society, Vol. XVI. Pt. I, the Rev. B. Hale Wortham has published \"The Story of Devasmit\u00e2, transl. from the Kath\u00e2 Sarit Sagara\":\u2014From the Proc. of the Beng. As. Society (Nov. 1883) we learn that\nProf. Max M\u00fcller, having stated that an edition of the Sarv\u0101nukramana (by Dr. A. A. Macdonnell, M.R.A.S.) is about to be published in the Anecdota Oxoniensia, Dr. Rajendra Lala said that he would not, therefore, add this work to his edition of Saunaka's Brihaddevat\u0101, as he had intended:\u2014To the Journal of the Beng. Asiatic Society, the same writer communicates a paper, entitled \"On Gonikaputra and Gonardiya as names of Patanjali,\" p. 261:\u2014In the J. Asiatic Society of Bombay, vol. xvi. No. xli. (an extra number), is a valuable report from Professor Peterson, \"On his search for Sanskrit MSS. in the Bombay circle,\" and on his remarkable success therein; and, in No. xlii. the Rev. A. F\u00fchrer gives Neryosangh's Sanskrit Translation of the Khordad-Avesta:\u2014In the Z. D. M. G. vol. xxxvii. p. 544, Prof. Aufrecht writes, \"Ueber die Pady\u0101mitatarangini;\" and, in p. 547, \"Ueber eine Oxford Handschrift\":\u2014and Prof. H. Jacobi contributes a letter on \"Datavya Bharat Karyalaya\":\u2014Dr. Leumann, also, reviews Max M\u00fcller's \"What can India teach us?\" (vol. xxxvii. p. 2):\u2014In the Indian Antiquary (August) Dr. Kielhorn has written, \"On the grammarian Bhartrihari\"; and in January, 1884, is an interesting paper by the late A. C. Burnell, \"On the Legend of Talavak\u0101ra (or Jaiminiya) Brahmana of the Sama Veda,\" and by Professor Whitney on the same: in the April number, Mr. K. T. Telang adds a paper, \"On the date of Sankarach\u0101rya.\"\n\nFrom the Journ. Asiatique (Fev.-Mars, 1883) we learn that M. Lancereau has published a new Translation of the Hitopad\u0113sa:\u2014M. Hauvette Besnault has read an episode from his translation of the Bh\u0101gavata Pur\u0101\u1e47a:\u2014In Oct.-Nov.-Dec., M. Bergaigne gives a paper entitled \"\u00c9tudes sur le Lexique du Rig Veda\":\u2014In Jan., 1884, M. L\u00e9on Feer continues his \"\u00c9tudes Bouddhiques,\" with a paper entitled \"Comment ou devient Deva.\"\n\nIn the Proceedings of the American Oriental Society are the\nfollowing papers (May, 1883), by Mr. W. D. Whitney, On the Jaiminiya or Talavak\u00e2ra Brahmana, first noticed by Burnell in 1878 (see ante), and published by him in the \"Atti\" of Florence Archaeological Congress (p. viii):\u2014by Prof. Avery, On Modes in Relative Clauses in the Rig-Veda (p. xii):\u2014by Prof. M. Bloomfield, \"On certain Irregular Vedic Subjunctives or Imperatives\" (p. xv):\u2014and Oct., 1883, by the same writer, \"On a proposed Edition of the Kau\u00e7ik\u00e2 Sutra of the Atharva Veda\":\u2014Mr. E. W. Hopkins, also, gives \"Notes on the Nandini Commentary to Manu\"; and, \"On the professed quotations from Manu found in the Mahabharata\":\u2014Prof. W. D. Whitney adds \"The various readings of the Sama Veda:\"\u2014In the Revue Critique (Sept. 24, 1883), M. Barth reviews G. Oppert's Nitiprak\u00e2cik\u00e2 et le \u00c7\u00e2kranitis\u00e2ra, and, while giving to him due praise for the scholarly work he has performed in his edition of the texts, rejects, altogether, his idea of the early use of guns, as well as of gunpowder, in India, holding that, while there is no evidence whatever in favour of this view, all reasonable presumption is against it:\u2014In Feb. 25, 1884, the same writer reviews, at great length, the valuable work, now in course of publication, at his own expense, by Pratap Chandra Roy, viz. The Mahabharata of Krishna Dvaipana Vyasa, translated into English prose. M. Barth well points out that it is refreshing for Sanskrit students again to take up the Mahabharata, and to put aside for the present the incessant studies of the Veda, of Buddhism, and of the Pur\u00e2nas. With the exception of a work of the late Dr. J. Muir, little has, he thinks, been done since the inventory of the great poem by Lassen in Z. D. M. G. 1837\u201350 and 1847\u201352 in his Ind. Alterthumskunde. It should be added that there is good hope that the whole of this work may be completed in about one hundred parts of seventy pages each, these parts to be issued at intervals of about two months. Mr. Pratap Roy has already published the Mahabharata, both in the original\nSanskrit and in the Bengali translation, and has, also, nearly completed a Bengali version of the Ramayana:\u2014In March 10, Dr. Barth also gives a pleasant notice of the veteran F. N\u00e9ve's \"Les \u00c9poques litteraires de l'Inde, \u00e9tudes sur la poesie Sanscrite.\" In the pages of the Gott. Gelehrt. Anzeigen, the Deutsch Litteratur-zeitung, the Litteratur-Central-Blatt, etc., are many notices of recent works, by MM. Jacobi, Pischel, Oldenberg, Weber, and other scholars, to which we have not space here to do more than refer.\n\nIn the Athen\u00e6um of August 25 is a review of the Rev. John Davies's Hindu Philosophy, a translation of the Bhagavadgita, or the Sacred Lay (one of Tr\u00fcbner's Oriental Series):\u2014in Sept. 15 is a careful notice of Mr. Bendall's excellent catalogue of the Buddhist Sanskrit MSS. in the University Library at Cambridge. We learn from this work that the cataloguer has been able to answer the doubts, not unnaturally raised by Prof. Weber and Mr. Burnell, as to the age of the MSS., and to show that some of them certainly go back to A.D. 1008, and are, therefore, among the oldest known Sanskrit MSS. The cold climate of Nepal, as compared to the damp climate of the S. of India, has doubtless been one cause of their longer preservation. Mr. Bendall has added to his Catalogue some useful \"Tables of Letters\" and \"Letter and Figure Numerals.\"\u2014In Oct. 6, is a very full notice of Prof. Beal's Fo-sho-hing-tsean-king\u2014a life of Buddha by Asvagosha\u2014(vol. xix. of the \"Sacred Books of the East\")\u2014and of the Sukh\u0101vati-vy\u016bha, Description of Sukh\u0101vati, the Land of Bliss, by Prof. Max M\u00fcller and the Rev. Bunyiu Nanjio. The first shows that Prof. Beal was the fit man for the work in hand, and that he has in many instances caught the inspiration of the poet-author in a truthful and graceful manner: the main value of the second is in the juxta-position of the Sanskrit text and of the Chinese version\u2014an interesting enquiry naturally arising, viz. from what texts were the\nChinese translations made? In Jan. 5, 1884, is a review of Rajendralala Mitra's last work, The Sanskrit-Buddhist Literature of Nepal\u2014valuable, if for nothing else, for his hearty recognition of what the veteran scholar Mr. B. H. Hodgson has done for Buddhist Literature, by the collections of MSS. he gave to the Asiatic Societies of Bengal, London, and Paris, gifts for which he has had but too slight a recognition. It may be doubted, however, whether the writer's views can be accepted when he states that the Chinese versions \"are avowed to be translations not from Tibetan or Pali texts, but from the Sanskrit.\" Anyhow, Prof. Beal holds that they are translations \"from the various Indian Prakrits.\" The work is well done, but shows the curious divergencies of the views of Native and European Scholars, when looking at the same thing and with the same data before them.\n\nIn the Academy (Aug. 25) is a notice of Prof. Windisch's work, \"Zwolf hymnen des Rig Veda mit Sayana's Commentar,\" a book apparently chiefly intended for professorial lecturers, containing, as it does, in a very compact form, all that is required for students, a glossary of all words both in the text and Sayana's commentary, with fuller explanations where needed.\u2014From Sept. 1, p. 149, we learn that Mr. F. S. Growse, of the Bengal C.S., has now completed the great work on which he has been engaged for the last six years (viz. the translation into English of the Ramayana of Tulsi D\u00e2s, the most popular vernacular poem of Upper India). The book has been handsomely printed at Allahabad, with seventeen autotype plates, and, as a specimen of excellent workmanship, may be well placed by the side of the enlarged edition of the same writer's \"Mathura.\" In Sept. 29 Prof. Beal confirms from the I-Tsing, the date for the King Sri Harsha Deva, suggested by Prof. Cowell in his Preface to Mr. Boyd's Translation of the \"Naganandha, a Buddhist Drama,\" and points out that, in his judgment, the I-Tsing, also, fixes the position of Sribhoja, where so many\ndevout Buddhists from China and India resided, viz. in that part of Sumatra or adjacent islands which was nearly under the equinoctial line. In Oct. 27 Dr. B\u00fchler gives a long and very interesting account of a paper by Shankar P. Pandit, \"On the Recovery of Sayana-Madhava's Commentary on the Kanva Recension of the White Yajur Veda.\" This paper was to have been read at the Leyden Congress, but, owing to some quarantine regulations at Venice, was detained there till too late. It will, of course, be printed in the Transactions of the Congress. This Commentary has been recently found in a library in the Canarese district of the Bombay Presidency. From the same Journal we learn that Professor Bhandarkar has drawn up a report of his successful work in the search for Sanskrit MSS. in the Maratha country, the Hyderabad territory and Berar, with a list of many rare MSS. of the Vedas and Vedangas from Poona and elsewhere: it appears, further, that Pandit Kashi Nath Kunte has well followed up his work of former years, having catalogued no less than 1606 MSS. in 1881-2. He was, also, in hopes of obtaining access to the Digambar Jain libraries at Dehli. The MSS. he had seen range between the fifteenth and nineteenth centuries. We hear, further, that the demand in India for translations of English standard works is rapidly increasing; thus Dr. Wilson's \"Religious Sects of the Hindus\" has been translated into Bengali, and is comprised in two volumes with an abundance of useful notes. It should be added that Dr. Fritze, who is well known for his successful renderings of the Works of Kalidasa, has recently published an excellent translation (in German) of the \"Pa\u00f1katantra,\" following the text in the Bombay Series of Drs. B\u00fchler and Kielhorn. Dr. Fritze doubts Prof. Benfey's conclusions as to the early history of this famous collection of tales, agreeing rather with Dr. B\u00fchler, that the work translated for Nushirvan was not the \"Pa\u00f1katantra,\" but one of many collections of moral tales current in India since the rise of Buddhism. Dr. A.\nA. Macdonnell, who has, for some time, been collecting materials for an edition of all the Ancient Indices of the Rig Veda, has, we gladly add, within the last few weeks, received from the University of Leipzig, \"maxim\u00e2 cum laude,\" the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, his dissertation being on a Sanskrit Theme, and his examiners Professors Windisch, Leskien, and Hildebrandt.\u2014Mr. Pincott has prepared a paper, to be printed in the third Number of this year's Journal of the Society, \"On the System whereby the Ancient Brahmins Arranged the Hymns of the Rig Veda Sanhita.\"\u2014Of miscellaneous papers, or books, may be noted Mr. K. T. Telang's Essay on the Mudrarashasa, being a Preface to his edition of that play.\n\nThe following books (or papers) may be mentioned as having come out during the past year:\u2014F\u00fchrer, A.

Babu Jogendranath\u2019s work, entitled Byabastha-Kalpadruma, is a valuable Treatise on the Hindu Law of Inheritance, etc., etc.\n\nHindustani.\u2014The New English-Hindustani Dictionary, begun some time since by the late Dr. S.

At the end of the volume are some Appendices, which give many curious notices of Nicobarese customs, etc.\n\nMiscellaneous Indian or Oriental.\u2014Under this head are\nplaced notices of papers or books, which do not strictly fall under any of the preceding groups. Thus, in the *Atheneum*, June 9, Prof. M. Williams gives a melancholy notice \"On Indian Female Education\":\u2014on July 14, is a valuable sketch of Gen. Walker's Indian Survey Report:\u2014Aug. 18, a good review of Oldenberg's Life of Buddha, translated by W. Hoey, M.R.A.S.:\u2014Sept. 1, a review of Dr. J.

Lastly, in April 5, is the outline of a grand scheme propounded by the same scholar of an \"Oriental University, Museum, and Guest House,\" to occupy in future the site of what was once the \"Royal Dramatic College.\" It is understood that this scheme is liberally supported by several Panjab chiefs, and by their historian, Sir Lepel Griffin, K.C.S.I., M.R.A.S.\n\nIn the *Academy*, Feb. 9, is a good notice by Mr. Nicholson of one of the best of recent works relating to India, the Native Life in Travancore, by the Rev.

Max M\u00fcller gives a very complete summary of the evidence now available for determining the probable date of Buddha's death (*i.e.* between 483 and 472 A.D.), it being of special interest to\nrecollect that, when Dr. M\u00fcller wrote his History of Sanskrit Literature, 25 years ago, he strongly advocated the date of 477 A.D., which, if wrong, is now shown to be so by only five or six years. In March 29, Prof. M\u00fcller sends a copy of a letter from a Travancore Missionary, the Rev. J. Knowles, objecting to the use of Italic letters for the transliteration of words in the languages of the South of India.\n\nThe address of the President, V. Ball, Esq., F.R.S., to the Royal Dublin Society, with the title \"A Geologist's contribution to the History of Ancient India,\" is very good:\u2014as are also papers by Mr. Justice Stephens and Sir Evelyn Baring in Nineteenth Century (October):\u2014So, also, Prof. Sayce's Oriental History in the Contemporary for July:\u2014\n\nA new periodical called \"The Voice of India,\" now in course of publication, is useful as giving the views of the Native Papers on all sorts of subjects:\u2014In Tr\u00fcbner's Record, No. 187, p. 50, is a long article on Dr. Leitner's Indigenous Education in the Panjab.\u2014In the Z.D.M.G. 27. 2. Prof. Jolly prints Gr\u00fcndung einer handschriften d. Bibliothek zu Benares:\u2014In the Indian Antiquary are several papers by Capt.

In October, Dr. B\u00fchlert writes On the relationship between the Andhras and Chalukyas; and Colonel Yule \"On Prof. F. Max M\u00fcller's Buddha and St. Josaphat\"; Capt. Temple gives, also, Story of Mulraj and his Son. In November, are notes by Capt. Temple about Raja Rasalu, and in January 1884, he prints The Hymns of Nangipanth, from the papers of the late J. W. Parry:\u2014In February is a paper \"On Mirzapur Folklore,\" and Dr. Burgess publishes a \"List of Chola Kings,\" sent to him some time ago by A. C. Burnell.\n\nOf books recently published, the most important is Professor A. Weber's Indische Studien, vol. xvi. and vol.\nxvii. pt. 1. In the first of these, Professor Weber writes, \"Ueber Bhuvanap\u00e2la Commentar zu H\u00e2la's Saptu\u00e7atakam.\"\n2. \"L\u00fccken bassen (der Arische charakter d.

James Darmesteter has printed \"Essais Orientaux,\" with two excellent essays, \"Le Dieu Supr\u00eame des Aryas,\" and \"Les Cosmogones Aryennes:\"\u2014Ujfalvy, K. E., Aus d.

Lastly, Mr. J. C. Nesfield adds a very valuable paper, entitled \"The Kanjars of Upper India.\" Among the reviews may be noticed one of Mr. Howell's Grammar of the Classical Arabic Language; and that of a very important recent work, Mr. A.

Armenischen).\"\n\n3. and commences the first part of a paper \"Ueber die heiligen schriften d. Jaina\": and Prof. Aufrecht adds Miscellanea, Dhammakirti, Bhamaha, etc. In the second, Prof. Weber concludes his Essay \"Ueber die heiligen Schriften der Jaina:\"\u2014Dr. Leumann gives a paper \"Die Alten, berichte von dem Schismen der Jaina:\"\u2014Prof. Weber gives two papers on \"Die Niralambopanishad and the Garudopanishad, respectively:\"\u2014Prof. Aufrecht writes on \"Eine Strophe von \u00c7a\u00e7vata:\"\u2014and Prof. Sachau gives the table of contents of his \"Albiruni's Indica.\" Prof. Monier Williams has published \"Religious Thought and Life in India,\" Pt. 1., in which he deals with Vedism, Brahmanism, and Hinduism; a second part will, we understand, comprise the other religions of India:\u2014M. James Darmesteter has printed \"Essais Orientaux,\" with two excellent essays, \"Le Dieu Supr\u00eame des Aryas,\" and \"Les Cosmogones Aryennes:\"\u2014Ujfalvy, K. E., Aus d. Westlichen Him\u00e1laya; and\u2014Forrest, G. W., Selections from the official writings of the Honourable M. Elphinstone.\n\nBibliotheca Indica.\u2014Of this series the following works have reached the Society's Library:\u2014Sthavira vali Charita, by Hemachandra, edited by Professor Jacobi:\u2014Chaturvarga Chintamani, by Hemadri, vol. 3, pt. 1, fasc. 6:\u2014Srauta Sutra of Apastamba, by R. Garbe, vol. 2, fasc. 6:\u2014Vayu Purana, by Rajendra lala, vol. 2, fasc. 4:\u2014Srauta Sutra, vol. 2, fasc. 6 and 7:\u2014Susruta Samhita, by Udoj Chand Dutt, fasc. 2:\u2014Ibn Hajir's Biography of those who knew Muhammed, vol. 2, 6, 7 fasc. 23, 24:\u2014and Munta-khab ut-Tawarikh, by Al Badaoni, by W. H. Lowe, vol. 2, fasc. 1.\u2014We understand that the Asiatic Society of Bengal has sanctioned the publication of the five following works\u2014\n1, Sankh\u00e2ya Srauta Sutra, ed. by Dr. Hillebrandt:\u20142, Saunaka's Sarv\u00e1nukramani, by Rajendra lala Mitra:\u20143, Tattva Chintamani, by Pandit K\u00e1m\u00e1khya\u0144\u00e1tha Tarkaratna:\u20144, Selections from the old Commentaries on Manu, by Prof. J. J. Jolly:\u20145, Brahmagupta's Karanagrantha\u2014the so-called Khanda Kh\u00e1dy\u00e0, by Prof. Thibaut.\n\nSacred Books of the East.\u2014Vol. xv. the second volume of the Upanishads, by Prof. F. Max M\u00fcller; and vol. xxi. Prof. Kern's translation of the Saddharma Pandarika, have been published: and we understand that considerable progress has been made towards the publication of the Second Series, which will begin with Prof. B\u00fchler's translation of Manu. In the Athen\u00e6um for August, p. 170, is a good review of Vols. 2 and 14, containing The Sacred Laws of the Aryas as taught in the Schools of Apastamba, Gautama, Vasistha, and Baudh\u00e1yana, edited by Prof. B\u00fchler; and, in Sept. 29, of Vol. 17, Vinaya Texts, Part 2, transl. from the Pali, by T. W. Rhys Davids and H. Oldenberg.\n\nThe Indian Institute at Oxford has continued to make steady progress, mainly owing to the energetic action of its founder, Prof. Monier Williams, who has made a third journey to India, during this last winter and spring, with the view of further interesting the Government of India in it. We rejoice to hear that he has been quite successful, and that the Indian Government are willing that six scholarships should be founded in it for deserving natives, if the Home Government assent to this step. A portion of the building, now in course of erection, will be opened for work on October 11 of the present year. The Institute has been recently still further enriched by the munificent donation from the Rev. S. O. Malan (the first Boden Sanskrit Scholar) of his Oriental Library, more than 2000 volumes in number.\nProf. Williams has recently delivered two lectures in Oxford before the Vice-Chancellor (Jowett) and a numerous audience, in the first of which, he pointed out the advantages to India of British rule and the corresponding gain to England by the training thus provided for numbers of young Englishmen. In noticing the new Russian railway, on the eastern side of the Caspian, the Professor added that if England and Russia would but meet peaceably at Her\u00e1t, nine days would suffice to connect England with India. The second lecture embodied the statements in the address given by him to this Society on its Anniversary, and will be found at the end of the present Report.\n\nThe Calcutta Review for the last year has many excellent papers, of which the following may be specified:\n\nIn No. 152 are papers by Mr. G. Patterson on \"The British Borneo Company,\" which will well repay perusal:\u2014by Mr. Beveridge, on the City of Patna:\u2014by the Rev. E. Sell, on \"The Khalif Al Mamun and the Mutazalas\":\u2014Mr. Symacharan Ganguli writes \"Bihar Dialects\u2014a rejoinder,\" being a further letter on the controversy between Messrs. Grierson and Hoernle, in which he urges the general use of Hindustani and the suppression of Dialects:\u2014Mr. Rehatsek gives the first part of a paper entitled \"Adamoli's Notes on a Journey from Persia to Tashkend\":\u2014and an excellent paper by Mr. J. C. Nesfield on \"The results of Primary Education in the North-West and Oudh.\" At the close of the Number is a review of Mr. A. E. Gough's Philosophy of the Upanishads, of Mr. H. E. Busteed's \"Echoes from Old Calcutta,\" and of the \"Bhagavad Gita\" transl. by the Rev. J. Davies, M.R.A.S.\n\nIn No. 153 is a good paper on \"The Material Progress of Ceylon\":\u2014a second one by Mr. J. C. Nesfield \"T results of Primary Education in the North-W Oudh\":\u2014and a second, also, by Mr. Rel\nAdamoli's Journey, etc.\" \u2014 Captain Temple, M.R.A.S., gives translations of \"Some Ghazals of Nazir Akbarabadi:\" \u2014 and the same writer tells a pleasant tale of the \"Folklore of the headless horseman in Northern India.\"\n\nIn No. 154 is an interesting paper entitled \"Capello and Ivens; their explorations in Africa, 1877\u201380\" \u2014 Mr. G. S. Gasper gives (for the subject) a sensible paper on \"English Spelling and the Spelling Reform\" \u2014 Ram Chundra Bose, \"On the Sankhya Philosophy\" \u2014 The Rev. Edward Sell deals with \"Sufism\" \u2014 Mr. Growse gives a notice of \"Bulandshahr,\" which is interesting, but scarcely new, as Mr. Growse has more than once written of this place elsewhere. Lastly, Mr. J. C. Nesfield adds a very valuable paper, entitled \"The Kanjars of Upper India.\" Among the reviews may be noticed one of Mr. Howell's Grammar of the Classical Arabic Language; and that of a very important recent work, Mr. A. J. Wall's Treatise on Indian Snake poisons, their nature and effects.\n\nIn No. 155 are papers by J. C. Nesfield, \"On Fire-making as a test of race\" \u2014 by H. G. Keene, \"The foundations of Aryan Law\" \u2014 by E. Rehatsek, \"The vicissitudes of the City of Baghdad, from its foundation till our times\" \u2014 by Ram Chundra Bose, \"The Sankhya Philosophy\" \u2014 with other papers of less general interest. There are, also, as usual, some good reviews of useful books recently published, as of Mr. J. A. Bourdillon's Report on the Census of Bengal, 1881; and of the excellent \"Manual of Jurisprudence for Forest Officers,\" by Mr. B. H. Baden-Powell, M.R.A.S.\n\nIn No. 156 are papers by R. C. Dutt, \"A plea for competitive Examinations\" \u2014 Capt. R. C. Temple continues his interesting notices of \"Folk songs from Northern India\" \u2014 by N. N. Ghose, \"On English Education in India from a Native point of view\" \u2014 by J. Capper, \"On the Colonies in the Calcutta Exhibition\" \u2014 and by J. C. Nesfield, \"On the\nPrimitive Philosophy of Fire.\" There is also a good review of Mr. H. M. Durand's life of his father, Sir H. M. Durand, and of Mr. Edwin Arnold's \"Indian Idylls.\"\n\n*Zend and Persian.*\u2014There has not been so much to record this year, as on some former occasions.\n\nHowever, in the *Athen\u00e6um*, June 16th, is a pleasant notice of a very pleasant book, Dr. C. J. Wills's \"In the Land of the Lion and the Sun,\" the chief result of its study being that the Persia of James Morier in 1823 is very much the same as that of 1883:\u2014In Feb. 2, 1884, is a very full review of Major H. G. Raverty's \"Tabakat-i-Nasiri, a general history of the Muhammadan Dynasties of Asia from A.D. 810 to A.D. 1260,\" a book, of value historically, if studied alongside of Briggs, Dow, Price, and of Sir Henry Elliot's compilations. One thing, however, greatly marring the value of Major Raverty's volumes, is, that he has not given to them an Index. It is nonsense to say (as Major Raverty says) that a scholar's time is \"too valuable\" to be employed in work a schoolboy could have done under his superintendence. From May 31, we learn that the noble collection of Oriental MSS. in the British Museum has been recently enriched by many valuable books, secured at the sale of the Library of the Comte de Gobineau, late French Ambassador at Teheran. We have not, however, space here, for any details of this most valuable purchase.\n\nIn the *Academy*, June 23, Mr. C. E. Wilson, M.R.A.S., reviews Dr. Wills's \"Land of the Lion and the Sun,\" already noted. In Aug. 18, is a brief\u2014too brief\u2014notice of the valuable Essays M. James Darmesteter has recently published under the modest title of \"Etudes Iraniennes\"\u2014the first volume deals with an historical grammar of the Persian language, from the time of Darius to that of Firdusi; the first part of the second volume contains critical reviews of various works on Iranian history and literature; while the\nsecond part supplies Pahlavi, Sanskrit and Persian Translations of some of the Yashts, etc., found in various MSS. in Paris and London. M. Darmesteter's work is as interesting as a novel. In Oct. Mr. C. E. Wilson also reviews, at great length, the Quatrains of Omar Khayyam by Mr. E. H. Whinfield, M.R.A.S., and discusses very carefully the question of the actual or probable belief of the writer; approving, on the whole, what Mr. Whinfield has accomplished, and generally his \"special felicity of interpretation.\" In May 21, 1884, is an important notice from Mr. Houtum Schindler, entitled \"A Visit to Khorassan,\" giving an account by S\u00e1ni-ed-douleh of a recent journey performed by him in Khorassan. Of course, we do not expect the Persian writer to be an archaeologist in the European sense of this word; but he has described fairly well the localities he visited. We rejoice to learn that Mr. C. E. Wilson has been appointed Reader of Persian at Cambridge.\n\nIn the Z.D.M.G. (37, 2), are papers by F. Teufel, on Babur und Abu Fazl; by R. Roth, Die Seelen des Mittelreichs im Parsismus; by M. de Harlez, Zur Erkl\u00e4rung des Avesta. In 37, 3, are papers by Bartholomae, Avestisch Mada-Mada:\u2014On Andreas's Book of the Mainyo-i-Khard; and H. Eth\u00e9, Neu Ir\u00e1n:\u2014In 38, 1, M. de Harlez publiahes \"L'Avestique Mada et la tradition Persane.\"\n\nIn the Journal Asiatique, Fevr.-Mars, 1883, J. Darmesteter writes, \"Fragment d'un Commentaire sur le Vendidad Farg. 2,\" and M. Chodzkiewicz describes \"Une tente Persane du xvi\u00e8 si\u00e8cle.\" In Ao\u00fbt-Sept. M. Halevy writes \"On the word Aspenj\":\u2014and in Jan. 1884, M. Barbier de Meynard reviews M. de Kazimirski's Dialogues Fran\u00e7ais-Persana.\n\nIn the Revue Critique (May, 1883) M. de Harlez reviews Hubschmann's Die Umschreibung d. Iranischen Sprachen, etc. In Nov. 26 is an excellent notice of the Rev. Lawrence H. Mills, and of the great work he is engaged on, viz. The Study of the Gathas (see p. 438):\u2014In Dec. 10, M. Darme-\nsteter gracefully reviews Miss Helen Zimmern's Epic of Kings, by Firdusi:\u2014In Dec. 17 is a notice of the Reprint of the Persian Text of the Sefer Nameh at Dehli, which is said to be very well done:\u2014In Feb. 4, 1884, M. Darmesteter reviews Andreas's Book of Mainyo-i-Khard, from a MS. at Copenhagen, procured by the late M. Westergaard:\u2014and in March 24 is a review by M. Br\u00e9al, of M. Bonet Maury's translation into French of the late Count de Noer's Akbar.\n\nWe may add that, in Ath\u00e9n\u00e9um Belge (Sept. 1883) M. de Harlez highly praises Geiger's \"Ost-Iranische Kultur\":\u2014in the D. Literaturzeitung for Oct. is a good notice by Zimmer, of Andreas's book:\u2014and in Nov., by Landauer, of Whinfield's Omar Khayyam.\n\nIn the Bulletin de l'Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e Orientale (1883, 1-2) M. Chodzko gives many extracts from the \"Vizir de Lenkeran,\" and points out its value; and (3 and 4) M. de Harlez deals further with Dr. W. Geiger's Ost-Iranische Cultur im Altertum.\n\nIn the M\u00e9langes Orientaux (dedicated to the Congress of Leyden) M. Schefer has printed \"Trois Chapitres du Khitay Nameh (in Persian and French).\n\nOf books relating to Persia, recently published, we may note the following: Whinfield, E., Quatrains of Omar Khayyam (2nd edition):\u2014Fitzgerald, C. (the late), Rubaiyat of Omar Khaiyyam:\u2014Harlez, M. de, L'Ex\u00e9g\u00e8se et la Correction des Textes Avestiques:\u2014Schefer, C., Chrestomathie Persane:\u2014E. H. Palmer's Concise Persian and English Dictionary, completed by Guy Le Strange, M.R.A.S.:\u2014Geldner, K. F., Drei Yasht aus dem Zendavesta:\u2014Barbier de Meynard, Boustan de Sadi:\u2014M. de Lagarde, Persische Studien:\u2014Abul-Fazl's Akbar-Namah, 3 vols., Lucknow, 2nd edition:\u2014Kazimirski, A. de B., Dialogues Fran\u00e7ais-Persanes, etc.:\u2014Chodzko, J., Grammaire de la Langue Persane, 2nd edition:\u2014West, E. W., Dadistan-i-Dinik and\nEpistles of Manus Kikar, Part 2.\u2014Fazl-i-Ali, Dictionary of English and Persian, Bombay:\u2014Rub\u00e2iyyat-i-Omar Khaiyyam, Lucknow:\u2014Rieu, C., Catalogue of the Persian MSS. in the British Museum, vol. iii.:\u2014and Robinson, Persian Poetry for English Readers.\n\nTurkish.\u2014From the Athen\u00e6um (Sept. 22) we learn that the Mijman-i-Funam, a scientific Magazine, started many years ago by Munif Pasha, but since suspended, has been resumed by him, and appears regularly in Constantinople:\u2014that Mazhar Effendi, who has been for some years lecturing in Turkish at the Imperial School of Medicine at Constantinople, has published his Lectures on Anatomy in a volume fully illustrated:\u2014and that there is now, also, publishing in Constantinople, a paper called the \"Osmanli,\" devoted to the architecture of Constantinople.\n\nFrom Dec. 15, we learn that Jaghatai, the literary language of the Eastern Turks, is being much studied at Constantinople, and that Sheikh Suleiman Effendi has produced a Dictionary in this language. It is hoped that in some of the old libraries old Jaghatai MSS. may yet be found. Vamb\u00e9ry discovered some, and Dr. Eth\u00e9 spoke at the Leyden Congress of a new text of the same class he hoped to be able to publish.\n\nIn the Academy for March 20, 1884, Mr. E. J. W. Gibb, M.R.A.S., gives a translation in English verse, line for line with the original, and with the preservation, as far as is possible, of the metre of the original Turkish, of a poem taken from a little volume called Zemzeme.\n\nIn the \"Melanges Orientaux\" M de Meynard has printed \"Notice de l'Arabie M\u00e9ridionale d'apr\u00e8s un document Turc.\"\n\nAmong books, may be mentioned MM. Chakri et Asgain, Dictionnaire Fran\u00e7.-Turc, Tome I:\u2014J. W. Redhouse, Engl.-Turk and Turk.-English Dictionary:\u2014and by the same, A Simplified Grammar of the Ottoman Turkish Lan-\nguage:\u2014E. J. W. Gibb, Translation of the History of Jewad:\u2014Faris ash Shidiak, a new Edition of his Grammar:\u2014and by M. du Rieu, Levini Warneri, De Rebus Turcicis epistol\u00e6 inedit\u00e6.\n\nWe should add that in the Revue Critique for April 14, 1884, is an account of the \u201cAlmanach de l\u2019Orient,\u201d published at Constantinople by M. A. Pal\u00e9ologue, with a notice of an interesting paper in it by M. Stavros Aristarchi, entitled \u201cLes Biblioth\u00e8ques Ottomanes \u00e0 Constantinople.\u201d Perhaps not every one is aware that there are sixty-eight public libraries in that City. A catalogue of the Library of the Hamidieh has just been issued by the Minister of Public Instruction.\n\nKurdish.\u2014In Z.D.M.G. (38. i.) is a long article by Mr. A. Houtum-Schindler, entitled Beitr\u00e4ge zur Kurdichse Wortschatze.\n\nChina Review.\u2014This journal has kept up during the past year its well-established reputation. Thus, in vol. xi. No. 5, March and April, 1883, Mr. Dyer Ball continues his \u201cScraps from Chinese Mythology,\u201d and Dr. Edkins his \u201cNotes on some Chinese Works.\u201d There are, also, a large number of papers of varying interest, such as (by an anonymous writer) \u201cOn the so-called blockade of Hong-Kong,\u201d in which the defects at present existing in the Junk Trade are clearly pointed out, and some remedies for the same indicated: Dr. S. W. Bushell, M.R.A.S., also writes, \u201cOn the Mongol mark on Porcelain:\u201d\u2014and M. G. von Gabelentz with reference to his Chinese grammar. Some brief but good notices of books are added, which will be of use to students of Chinese matters.\n\nIn No. 5, May and June, Mr. C. H. Piton continues his account of China during the Tsin Dynasty, a.d. 264\u2013419 and Mr. Dyer Ball his \u201cScraps from Chinese Mythology:\u201d\nMr. E. H. Parker contributes two valuable papers, the first \"On Sz-ch'uen Plants,\" which shows how much can be accomplished by any one who has his heart in his subject, without \"any apparatus for preserving the specimens while travelling comfortlessly and through a poor and mountainous part of the country, among nations more ignorant and suspicious than the average.\" The chief botanical questions of the Sz-ch'uen, he adds, are the varnish, wax, tallow and wood-oil trees. The second, \"On the Rapids of the Upper Yangtsze,\" gives the native sailing instructions for the gorges of the Great River, translated from the narrative of Admiral Ho chin shen, who was officially employed in superintending the gunboats, etc., between I-ch'ang and Wu-Shan. M. Kleinwachter, also, writes \"On the origin of the Arabic numerals,\" and establishes some, though rather a slight connexion, between the Indian and the Chinese forms. There are brief notices, also, of Bunyiu Nanjio's Translation of the Buddhist Tripitaka, and of Dr. Chalmers' \"Structure of Chinese characters after the Shwoh-wan 100 A.D. and the Phonetic Shwoh-wan, 1833.\"\n\nIn vol. xii. No. 1, July and August, Mr. Piton further continues his \"China under the Tsin dynasty, A.D. 264-269,\" and Mr. Kleinwachter adds some further notes \"On the origin of the Arabic numerals,\" a complicated problem which he does not seem to have fully realized. Mr. E. H. Parker continues his studies of the vernaculars of China, with a precise account of the Dialect of Yung-chow, and Mr. Jordan gives a notice of the poet, commonly called Su Fung-p'o, who lived in the province of Sz-ch'uan in A.D. 1036. A promising scholar, Mr. J. Stewart Lockhart, reviews Dr. Chalmers' work noted above; which is a classified r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the Shwoh-wan, the celebrated dictionary of the first century A.D. and of the Phonetic Shwoh-wan, an able work of which we speak further on. The learned sinologist has there explained with great\nability the Chinese style of writing (known in this country as the small seal character), the Siao-chuan, as it existed about the Christian era, with the explanations, often childish, of the native authors. It is to be regretted that Dr. Chalmers, at least in his preface, has not thought fit to give some information on the older styles of writing which have been used in succession previously to the Siao-chuan. It is worthy of note as a remarkable instance of painstaking perseverance that Dr. Chalmers is able to say \"that every character in the volume has been written for the lithographer with the author's own hand:\" the work was compiled in China and printed in Scotland during a short stay of the author at home. This number contains, also, a few notices of books relating to China and Japan, such as, of Mr. W. G. Dixon's \"Land of the Morning\"\u2014\"Cochin Chine Fran\u00e7aise, Excursions et Reconnaissances,\" etc., etc.\n\nVol. xii. No. 2, Sept. and Oct., contains papers by Messrs. J. H. Stewart Lockhart, Dr. Edkins, R. H. Graves, G. Jamieson, and B. C. Henry. Dr. Edkins writes on the vexed question of the \"Yi-king, with notes on the Sixty-four Kwa,\" which he evidently considers to have been in some sense a \"book of divination,\" or, at all events, to have been used for this purpose, divination having been in common use in China before and during the time of Confucius. In this paper, Dr. Edkins deals with the first 29 Kwas. Mr. Graves writes on \"Aryan Roots in Chinese,\" taking for his basis those given in Prof. Skeat's \"Etymological Dictionary,\" and, for Chinese, the \"Cantonese Colloquial,\" the connections suggested being, as might be expected, rather with Sanskrit than with any other Aryan tongue\u2014perhaps, too, it may be added, that his conclusions are not very convincing. Mr. Jamieson's paper \"On the tributary Nations of China,\" has some interest at the present time, as showing what was and is the habit of the Greater Empire in dealing with the smaller states which pay tribute to her, the general conclu-\n\nVOL. XVI.\u2014[NEW SERIES.]\nsion being that the connection between the two may be best described as a \"Relationship at Will, begun at will, continued at will, and therefore terminable at will.\" There is, also, a curious notice of the ceremonies to be observed on the occasion of investing a Corean Prince as king. Mr. B. C. Henry completes his account of a \"Journey through Hainan,\" a curious record of well-attempted though unsuccessful travel. There is, also, a good review of Professor Beal's Fo-Sho-Hing-Tsang, or Life of Buddha (Sacred Books of the East, vol. xix.), and of Colonel Money's \"Cultivation and Manufacture of Tea.\" From the latter we learn that India is now pressing China hard, on what was long her peculiar and especial source of wealth. Thus, from 1879 to 1882, the Indian export of tea has risen from 35 millions of pounds to 51 millions, while, on the other hand, the Chinese export has fallen off by 12 millions, i.e. 125 millions in the first year, and 113 millions in the second.\n\nVol. xii. No. 3, Nov. Dec. In this No. Messrs. Piton and Dyer Ball continue their former papers, the other contributors being Messrs. Henry, E. H. Parker, R. Eichler, and E. L. Oxenham. Mr. Henry in his paper \"On eight Lions of Canton,\" points out that the number \"eight\" has, for some reason, had a special influence in Chinese Philosophy till, at length, in Canton, this influence has been crystallized around certain objects, and has found concrete expression in what has been designated as the \"Eight great Sights\" of that city. The whole paper is very curious. Mr. E. H. Parker's notice of the Winchow Dialect is valuable philologically, in that we learn from it that, with the exception of the letter r, \"every letter in the English (we may indeed say, in the European and Sanskrit) alphabet is found as an initial.\" The rest of the paper is technical, and of value chiefly to Chinese scholars; it, at the same time, shows earnest study, and a remarkable acquaintance with the vernaculars of Southern China. There are, as usual, some\ngood notices of books, such as that of the new Edition of Dr. S. Wells Williams's \"Middle Kingdom.\" Mr. Williams was a distinguished Scholar, as well as Missionary, and the President of the American Oriental Society, at the time of his recent and lamented death.\n\nVol. xii. No. 4, Jan. and Feb. 1884, contains continuations of former papers by H. Dyer Ball, Esq., and Charles Piton, Esq., and others by Messrs. Arendt, G. M. H. Playfair, A. A. Fauvel and Kleinwachter. Of these Mr. Arendt contributes three papers\u2014\"On the Mother of Mencius,\" which is curious; Chiang-Yi's \"Apologues of the Fox and the Tiger and the Dog,\" and Su Tai's \"Apologue of the Bittern and the Mussel\": Mr. Playfair gives in verse, a translation of \"A song to encourage Thrift\" (which however scarcely does so), by Governor-General Chiang:\u2014M. A. A. Fauvel gives an interesting account of \"Chinese Plants in Normandy:\"\u2014M. Kleinwachter adds a good notice of the \"History of Formosa under the Chinese Government\" down to the present time. There is, also, an excellent review of Mr. H. A. Giles's \"Gems of Chinese Literature.\"\n\nBesides the China Review, and other periodicals, such as the Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal, which we have no room to analyse in the present Report, a considerable number of papers, essays, and books have been issued from the press during the last year, to some of which attention will now be called. In the Athen\u00e6um (Aug. 11) is a brief but good notice of Dr. Eitel's Chinese Dictionary in the Cantonese dialect, parts iii. and iv.; and, from the same Journal, we learn (March 1, 1884) that Mr. D. C. Boulger, M.R.A.S., has read a paper before the Society of Arts entitled, \"Reflections on Chinese History, with reference to the present situation of affairs,\" and Dr. Zerffi, F.R.S.L., a paper, \"On the Tch\u00f3ng-Y\u00f3ng of Confucius,\" before the Roy. Hist. Soc.:\u2014from March 29, that M. Billequin has translated M. Malgutty's \"Elementary Chemistry\"\ninto Chinese, and that this work has been published at the College of Pekin under the auspices of the Chinese Government, the preface to it having been written by the First Minister, His Excellency Tong Lung. The same scholar has also translated Fresenius's \"Chemical Analysis.\" Mr. Herbert Spencer's \"Education\" has, also, just been rendered into Chinese by Y. K. Yen (May 17).\n\nIn the *Academy* (July 21) is an able letter by Dr. Edkins \"On criticism of Early Chinese Literature,\" in which he replies to some of Prof. T. de Lacouperie's objections, and speaks in high terms of the scholarship of the Chinese Minister in this country, the Marquis Tseng:\u2014and, in July 28, Sept. 1, and Oct. 6, Prof. de Lacouperie gives three letters, successively entitled, \"Early Chinese Literature,\" \"The Affinity of the Ten Stems of the Chinese Cycle with the Akkadian Numerals,\" and \"The Chinese Mythical Kings and the Babylonian Canon,\" in the first of which he replies to Dr. Edkins, and, in the other two, enforces by abundant examples and illustrations his original view of the connection of the civilization of South-Western Asia with China. This he has well summarized in the following words: \"The Chinese mythical list of Kings is based on the early Babylonian Canon, and reproduces the first Dynasty of Eighty-six Kings mentioned by Berosus, as well as many legends and historical facts of the same period.\" In Oct. 20 is a very interesting, though perhaps not entirely exact, letter by Dr. Edkins on \"The Early History of Cochin-China.\" In Nov. 17, Prof. T. de Lacouperie returns to his main subject in a letter entitled, \"Traditions of Babylonia in Early Chinese Documents,\" which gives some more details about the fragments of the Babylonian Canon, scattered among the Chinese traditions of the Mythical period. These we hear will be yet more fully dealt with in a work he has in the press. In December 29 Professor Douglas reviews the new Edition of the late\nProfessor S. Wells Williams's \"Middle Kingdom,\" in which the useful portion of the revised work is well pointed out. [See also, in \"Tr\u00fcbner's Record,\" Nos. 191-2, p. 100, a severe stricture on this work by H. A. Giles.] In the same number, also, is a short notice of Dr. Eitel's Dictionary, in which, while praising highly the whole, the reviewer shows there are many errors which ought not to have been left uncorrected:\u2014in Jan. 12 of Mr. Dyer Ball's \"Cantonese made easy,\" and \"Easy Lessons in the Hakka Dialect\":\u2014in Feb. 9 Dr. Edkins writes on \"The Chinese Cycles of Ten, Twelve, and Twenty-Eight,\" in which, admitting that all these Cycles \"are more or less remotely connected with the West,\" he remarks that the Silk Trade \"would render the communication of Babylonian knowledge possible in China.\"\n\nIn Feb. 23 Prof. Douglas reviews Mr. H. A. Giles's \"Gems of Chinese Literature,\" in which, while allowing the general goodness of this scholar's work, he would like to feel sure \"of what we have in every case before us, whether an accurate translation or only a paraphrase\":\u2014In March 1, March 8, and March 15, M. de Harlez and M. de Lacouperie discourse amicably \"The origin of Chinese Civilization.\"\n\nBefore the British Association for the Advancement of Science, at their meeting at Southport, Sept., 1883, Mr. W. Hancock read a paper, \"On North Formosa,\" and Mr. H. S. Hallett, \"On the advance of the Southern Chinese.\"\n\nIn the Journ. R. A. S. Vol. XV. Pt. 3, Prof. Beal, M.R.A.S., has printed \"Two sites named by Hiouen-Thsang in the 10th Book of the Si-yu-ki;\" and, in Vol. XVI. Pt. 2, \"Some further gleanings from the Si-yu-ki\":\u2014Mr. H. H. Howorth, M.R.A.S., has also issued \"The Northern Frontagers of China, Part VI. Hia or Tangut,\" in Vol. XV. Pt. 3.\n\nIn the Journal Asiatique (Ao\u00fbt-Septembre) M. Imbault-Huart continues his \"Miscellan\u00e9es Chinois, fragments d'un\nvoyage dans la province du Kiang-sou\u201d :\u2014(Oct.-Nov.-Dec.) M. Edouard Specht writes on \u00c9tudes sur l\u2019Asie Centrale d\u2019apr\u00e8s les Historiens Chinois :\u2014M. Imbault-Huart (Jan. 1884) further continues his previous paper. Scattered in other Journals, etc., may be noted Dr. Legge\u2019s Tao Teh King, in the British Quarterly Review (July 1, 1883) :\u2014Ditto, On Mencius, Encyclop. Brit. (vol. xvi.) :\u2014In the Proc. of the American Or. Soc., Prof. B. S. Lyman has written, \u201cOn certain Sounds in the Peking Pronunciation of Chinese.\u201d We may add to these, Duchateau, Sur l\u2019ancien Nom Serique (Athen. Orient. 1, 2) :\u2014Hoskiaer, V., Routes Commerc. de Yunnan (Danish Roy. Geog. Soc.) :\u2014Scott, W., Ting-huan-tschu (Erdkunde in Kurz darstellung) (Sitz. Berl. Ak. d Wissensch.

Cordier has printed an \u201cEssai d\u2019une Bibliographie des ouvrages publi\u00e9s en Chine par les Europ\u00e9ens au xvii\u00b0 et au xviii\u00b0 si\u00e8cle.\u201d\n\nIn the Annales de l\u2019Extr\u00eame Orient, the following papers may be noticed :\u2014Thus (July, 1883), M. de Lucy-Fossarieu gives an account of \u201cLes Codes de la Cochin-Chine et du Cambodge\u201d :\u2014In the September No. is a severe judgment on Li-Hun-Chang and the Chinese Army, by an anonymous writer :\u2014In Jan., 1884, is a brief account of \u201cLes Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Secr\u00e8tes de la Chine;\u201d of the Commerce of Lower Cochin-China; and of an interesting journey made by Capt. Gautier into the wild country of the Mois :\u2014In Feb. is an article on the Emperor of China and his Court :\u2014In March is a notice of a translation from Ta-Tsing-Hwei-Tien, by Dr. G. Jamieson, of Shanghai, to the effect that the presents sent with various European Ambassadors have always been considered by the Chinese historians as so many tributes! In the same number is a translation of a paper read by Mr. C. H. Lepper, M.R.A.S., before the British Association at\nPagoda, which was printed by order of the Empress Shiyau-toku in the latter half of the eighth century A.D. There are, also, copies of Buddhist works issued during the following centuries, together with native editions of Chinese works, beginning with the \"Confucian Discourses\" (A.D. 1364), the first non-Buddhist work printed in Japan.\n\nIn the Academy (Aug. 18) is a review by Mr. Monkhouse, of Mr. E. G. Holtzman's \"Eight Years in Japan,\" a work, perhaps, not of great literary merit, but, as a description of the people he met with, thoroughly reliable.\u2014and in March 29, 1884, the same reviewer notices, with high praise, the \"Japan\" of Prof. J. J. Rein, the valuable outcome of travels and researches undertaken at the cost of the Prussian Government in the years 1874 and 1875.\n\nIn the Annales de l'Extr\u00eame Orient (August, 1883), M. Meyners D'Estrey writes on Japanese Anthropology:\u2014and in October, December, and February, 1884, M. Pierre Bons D'Anty gives three articles entitled \"Les Divisions Territoriales du Japon, G\u00e9ographiques, Politiques et Administratives,\" which are interesting as giving brief but clear summaries of the matters with which they deal. In February, is a notice of a new Society, called Kana-no-Khwai, the object of which is to eliminate from the Japanese language, as far as possible, the Chinese characters which materially add to the difficulty of its study. The Society proposes in future to make use of only the Kana or Indigenous Alphabet, which comprises 48 distinct characters.\n\nIn the Journal of the American Oriental Society, Prof. B. S. Lyman has a paper On the Japanese Nigori of Composition. Among miscellaneous papers may be mentioned Pfizmaier, A., Untersuchungen \u00fcber Aina-gegenst\u00e4nde (Sitzbericht. Wien. Akad.):\u2014Rosny, L. de, Memorial sur l'Antiquit\u00e9 Japonaise (M\u00e9langes Orient.):\u2014M\u00fcller-Beeck, F. G., Gesch. d. Liukiu Inseln nach Japan (Berl. Ges. f.

Terrien de Lacouperie has been appointed Professor of Indo-Chinese Philology in University College, London.\n\nJapan.\u2014A considerable number of essays, reviews, and books have been issued during the last year on subjects connected with Japan, to some of which we shall briefly refer here. Thus, in the Journ. Roy. Asiat. Soc., XV. 3, Chamberlain, B. H., writes On two questions of Japanese Archaeology:\u2014in the Athen\u00e6um (June 2) is an excellent review of the \u201cDiary of Richard Cocks, Cape-Merchant in the English Factory in Japan, A.D. 1615-22,\u201d which has been edited for the Hakluyt Society by Mr. E. M. Thompson. We, also, learn (Oct. 20) that many of Mr. Herbert Spencer\u2019s works have been translated into Japanese, and, also, that, in the University of Tokio, they, along with other European works, are studied in the originals. From May 31, we, also, learn that an interesting collection of early printed books from Japan and Corea has been offered for purchase to the Trustees of the British Museum. The earliest specimen is a Buddhist D\u0101r\u0101ni, enclosed in a small wooden model of a\nPagoda, which was printed by order of the Empress Shiyau-toku in the latter half of the eighth century A.D. There are, also, copies of Buddhist works issued during the following centuries, together with native editions of Chinese works, beginning with the \"Confucian Discourses\" (A.D. 1364), the first non-Buddhist work printed in Japan.\n\nIn the Academy (Aug. 18) is a review by Mr. Monkhouse, of Mr. E. G. Holtsman's \"Eight Years in Japan,\" a work, perhaps, not of great literary merit, but, as a description of the people he met with, thoroughly reliable:\u2014and in March 29, 1884, the same reviewer notices, with high praise, the \"Japan\" of Prof. J. J. Rein, the valuable outcome of travels and researches undertaken at the cost of the Prussian Government in the years 1874 and 1875.\n\nIn the Annales de l'Extr\u00eame Orient (August, 1883), M. Meyners D'Estrey writes on Japanese Anthropology:\u2014and in October, December, and February, 1884, M. Pierre Bons D'Anty gives three articles entitled \"Les Divisions Territoriales du Japon, G\u00e9ographiques, Politiques et Administratives,\" which are interesting as giving brief but clear summaries of the matters with which they deal. In February, is a notice of a new Society, called Kana-no-Khwai, the object of which is to eliminate from the Japanese language, as far as possible, the Chinese characters which materially add to the difficulty of its study. The Society proposes in future to make use of only the Kana or Indigenous Alphabet, which comprises 48 distinct characters.\n\nIn the Journal of the American Oriental Society, Prof. B. S. Lyman has a paper On the Japanese Nigori of Composition. Among miscellaneous papers may be mentioned Pfizmaier, A., Untersuchungen \u00fcber Aina-gegenst\u00e4nde (Sitzbericht. Wien. Akad.):\u2014Rosny, L. de, Memorial sur l'Antiquit\u00e9 Japonaise (M\u00e9langes Orient.):\u2014M\u00fcller-Beeck, F. G., Gesch. d. Liukiu Inseln nach Japan (Berl. Ges. f. Anthropol.) :\u2014Brauns, D., Die Ainu der Insel Yezo (ibid.):\u2014Art Manufactures in\nJapan (Builder, xlv. No. 2111):\u2014and, in the Chrysanthemum, iii. 3, Chamberlain, B.

S. Ely. Among miscellaneous books, we may mention Cotteau, E., De Paris au Japon en quatre-vingt-dix Jours:\u2014Audsley, G. A., The Ornamental Arts of Japan, part i.:\u2014Crowe, A. H., Highways and Byways in Japan:\u2014Griffis, W. E., Corea, the Hermit Nation:\u2014Dresser, C., Japan, its Architecture, Art, and Art Manufacture:\u2014and a new Edition of \u201cMurray\u2019s Handbook for Japan,\u201d drawn up by E. M. Satow, Esq., M.R.A.S., now H.M. Agent and Consul-General at Bangkok, and Lieut. A. G. S. Hawes, R.A., and F. A. J. von Langezg, Japanische Thee-geschichten:\u2014Fu-s\u00f4-ch\u00e2-wa,\u2014a series of Miscellaneous Essays. In the \u201cM\u00e9langes Orientaux,\u201d M. L\u00e9on de Rosny gives \u201cKo-z\u00ee-ki, M\u00e9morial de l\u2019Antiquit\u00e9 Japonaise.\u201d\n\nFurther India and Malayo-Polynesia.\u2014To the \u201cAnnales de l\u2019Extr\u00eame Orient,\u201d with its now additional title \u201cet de l\u2019Afrique,\u201d as on former occasions, we are indebted for many notices of the Islands, etc., to the East of India Proper. What, however, we have to record, from this source, is, this year, comparatively little, as, unfortunately, a large part of this once valuable Journal is now given to Politics, not to say Polemics, into which we cannot enter: this new plan mars, too, its value as a record of literary work. Taking, then, as little heed as possible to International Politics, the following articles may be noticed:\u2014Thus, in the July number, agreeably with the new title of this work, we have an account of Madagascar by M. Charles Gr\u00e9mieux, accompanied by an useful and well-executed Map of the Island:\u2014In August, the same writer deals with what he calls \u201cLe Second Canal de Suez.\u201d There is, also, a\nbrief notice of the New Hebrides and of a Birmese Embassy recently arrived in Paris. At the end of it, Dr. Harmand briefly replies to some of the views put forth by Mr. A. H. Keane, in the \"Annales\" for Feb. and March of last year. In September, M. de Fonville has a good paper entitled \"La Justice aux Indes Orientales N\u00e9erlandaises,\" p. 65.\n\nIn October, M. Leon F\u00e9er gives a pleasant r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the Congress of Orientalists at Leyden:\u2014There is, also, a notice of \"Binh-Thuan, nouvelle province Fran\u00e7aise,\" a brief sketch of the \"Marquis Tseng,\" with a notice of two useful books of their class, M. Paul Deschanel's \"La question du Tongkin,\" and of M. Bouinais's \"La Cochin-Chine contemporaine.\"\n\nIn November, is a very interesting Memoir of Dr. A. J. C. Geerts, who has been known for the last 14 years, as one of the most eminent Europeans in Japan\u2014together with a notice of the discovery of the scene of the massacre of the ill-fated La Perouse and of his companions. The December Number, with the exception of a brief article on the Volcanic action of Krakatau, is entirely political. In January 1884, is a further account of the misdeeds of Krakatau and a good notice of M. Gautier's \"Les Fran\u00e7ais au Tonkin 1787\u20131883.\"\u2014We learn, also, that, apropos of the last Oriental Congress at Leyden, L'Institut Royal des Indes N\u00e9erlandaises has published four volumes of importance for the history of the Extreme East, 1. Essais de po\u00e9sie Boughis et Macassar, par la Dr. B. T. Matthes; 2. Histoire de Nanette, texte Boughis, etc., par G. K. Niemann; and two vols. of the Memoires de l'Institut.\u2014The February Number contains nothing of any interest. That of March contains a good article by M. Dubard entitled, \"La Legislation Cambodgienne,\"\u2014and one by M. L\u00e9on Feer (all that this scholar writes is worthy of attention) on \"Les Trente-deux R\u00e9cits du Trone, ou les merveilleux exploits de Vikramaditya, traduits du Bengali.\"\u2014In the number for April, M. Valabrigue gives a paper, \"Sur la litt\u00e9rature\nAnnamite,\u201d and there is, also, a brief notice of the Oasis of Merv.\n\nOf the excellent collection published by the French Government at Saigon, under the title \u201cCochin-chine Fran\u00e7aise, Excursions et Reconnaissances,\u201d several numbers have appeared, the most important of which is an able \u201cEtude sur la Litterature Annamite,\u201d by Mr. L. Villard, who gives long quotations translated from the original texts (No. xii. pp. 446\u2013491). In the \u201cM\u00e9langes Orientaux,\u201d M. des Michels prints Kem V\u00e2n Ki\u00ean Truy\u1ec1n, po\u00e8me Annamite, avec traduction.\n\n**Egyptology.**\u2014The work of the last year and the discoveries made in it have so far surpassed that of any similar period of the same length, that it is impossible within our limits to do more than allude to many matters, each of which really deserves a careful study and a full record. As on former occasions, we can only note the more important papers that have been issued during the last year, with a list of books, etc. Thus, in the Proceedings of the Biblical Archaeological Society, May 1, 1883, is a letter from Mr. Le Page Renouf \u201cOn mythological figures on an Egyptian papyrus:\u201d\u2014June 5, a letter from Prof. Pleyte \u201cOn Mr. Revillout\u2019s notice of The Papyrus-Dodgson:\u201d\u2014and in the same number, a communication from Mr. Cope Whitehouse \u201cOn his Researches in the Moeris Basin\u201d and what, he (probably) alone, thinks, these demonstrate:\u2014In Dec. 4, Jan. 8, Feb. 5, March 4 and April 1, are a series of papers \u201cOn Hypocephali by Dr. Birch and Mr. De Horrack. The plates of the objects, which are perfect as specimens of art, have been drawn on stone by the Sec. B.A.S., Mr. W. H. Rylands, M.R.A.S., F.S.A.:\u2014Mr. Le Page Renouf contributes two papers, the first \u201cOn two Egyptian prepositions,\u201d Feb. 5; the second, \u201cOn the bow in the Egyptian Sky,\u201d March 4. In the Transactions of the Society, vol. viii. pt. 1, M. Revillout prints, \u201cLes\nAnath\u00e8mes d\u2019une M\u00e8re Payenne contre son fils devenu Chr\u00e9tienne,\u201d and \u201cPi\u00e8ces relatives \u00e0 une mariage du temps de Darius:\u201d\u2014in Part 2, Dr. Birch has a paper \u201cOn a Tablet in the British Museum relating to two Architects,\u201d and Mr. Le Page Renouf, one, \u201cOn Egyptian Mythology, particularly with reference to Mist and Cloud.\u201d Again, from the Athen\u00e6um, June 30, we learn that H.H. the Prince Ibrahim Hilmy, the brother of the Khedive, is preparing a bibliography of Printed Books, MSS., etc., relating to the Political and Social life of Egypt from the earliest to the present times:\u2014In the same number, in July 21, and in Aug. 18, Signor Lanciani gives the wonderful tale of the recent discoveries in Rome on the site of the Iseum:\u2014In July 7, is a good review of Dr. Birch\u2019s very complete catalogue of \u201cThe Collection of Egyptian Antiquities at Alnwick Castle\u201d; and we also learn that he is far advanced with his \u201cHieroglyphic Dictionary.\u201d\n\nIn March 1 is a review of Mr. W. M. Flinders Petrie\u2019s \u201cThe Pyramids and Temples of Ghizeh,\u201d which is interesting as all works on such a subject must be, which are original. Mr. Petrie\u2019s measurements are, probably, superior to those of any of his predecessors; we are, therefore, glad to learn that the Royal Society has granted to him \u00a3100, in aid of further researches.\n\nIn March 22 is a notice of the Report of \u201cThe Commission for the Preservation of the Monuments of Cairo,\u201d for whom our Member, E. T. Rogers Bey, has worked so zealously\u2014the object of the Commission being simply to see to necessary repairs, not, as has been ruinously done in India, to restore or rebuild.\n\nIn April 26 is a brief notice of Mr. J. Loftie\u2019s \u201cEssay on Scarabs,\u201d\u2014a useful manual for collectors, who, we hear, are more likely to secure the objects themselves than the book intended for their description, as the number of copies issued has been strangely limited.\nMuseum. In Jan. 19, Prof. Sayce writes from Abydos, announcing the discovery of a tomb of the XIIIth Dynasty, near Si\u00fbt, and stating that the tombs in the cliff behind the Citadel of Cairo are not older than the time of Augustus.\u2014In Feb. 2, is a further letter from Prof. Sayce, dated Luxor, Jan. 7, which has only to be read, to be appreciated. To March 15, Mr. R. S. Poole contributes Mr. Flinders Petrie's own description of his remarkable discoveries in \"The Great Temple of San,\" of the highest interest as showing how much, after more than 2000 years of wilful destruction, there still remains, in Egypt, to reward the honest explorer; see, also, in April 5, a capital letter from M. Naville on the same subject.\u2014In the same Number, is an energetic letter from M. Renan urging support to M. Maspero in his great labours in Egyptian excavation. M. Renan's letter commences with the words, \"La conservation des monuments de l'Egypte importe \u00e0 l'humanit\u00e9 tout enti\u00e8re\"\u2014and, concludes, no less characteristically, \"Ajoutons que l'honneur de la France s'y trouve engag\u00e9e.\"\u2014Lastly, in July 21, Mr. R. S. Poole demolishes Mr. Cope Whitehouse, and his vagaries about Lake Moeris; and, in Sept. 22, satisfactorily answers Prof. Lepsius's contention that M. Naville has not found \"the Pithom of the Bible,\" though what the latter scholar has advanced \"rests on the unimpeachable testimony of monuments dug up on the spot.\"\u2014In a still later paper (May 24, 1884) Mr. Poole conveys to us the welcome news that Dr. Brugsch fully and unreservedly accepts M. Naville's discovery.\n\nIn the Z.D.M.G. is a paper by Dr. A. Erman, entitled Eine Aegyptisch Statuette (37. 3).\n\nIn the Journal Asiatique M. Maspero (Oct.-Nov.-Dec. p. 533) gives an account of an Egyptian inscription of 6000 lines, recently discovered by him.\n\nFrom the Rev. Crit. we learn that, in M. Royet's Monuments de l'Art Antique, livrs. 3, 4, there are many beautiful\nspecimens of Egyptian art, with descriptions by M. Maspero. In Jan. 7, 1884, is a notice of M. Maspero's \"Conference sur la vie populaire \u00e0 Thebes sous les Rois de la XIXe Dynastie\":\u2014in April 7, is the substance of M. Renan's appeal in favour of the preservation of Egyptian monuments. Lastly, in May 5, we have a notice of M. Maspero's forthcoming Guide to the Museum at Boulaq.\n\nThe Revue Egyptologique continues to publish many valuable and well-illustrated papers. Thus, IIIe Ann. No. 1, contains papers by M. Revillout and the late M. Chabas, with a notice of the recent additions to the Egyptian Museum in the Louvre: \u2014 Sybil, L. v., also, writes, Kritik d. Aegypt. Ornements. IIIe Ann. No. 2, has a second letter from M. Revillout to M. Lenormant, \"Sur les Monnaies Egyptiennes,\" and a paper by MM. Revillout et Krall, \"La vie d'artiste ou de Boh\u00e8me en Egypte, fragment d'un po\u00e8me Satyrique.\" Three parts have been issued of the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Aegyptische Sprache u. Alterthumskunde, containing papers by MM. Lepsius, Erman, Stern, Naville, Dumichen, Lef\u00e9bure, Maspero, Wiedemann, and others.\n\nOf miscellaneous books, the following may be noted: Lagarde, P. de, Aegyptiaca:\u2014Prato, La leggenda del Tesoro di Ramsinite:\u2014Lemm, Aegyptische Lesest\u00fccke:\u2014Linke, A. A., Skizze d. Aelt-Aegypt. Lit.:\u2014Wiedemann, A., Aelt-Aegyptische w\u00f6rte von Klass. Autoren:\u2014and, by the same, Aelt-Aegypt. Gesch. 1. Abth.:\u2014Landmehr, Papyrus Bero-linens:\u2014Maspero, Mastabas de l'Ancien Empire, vol. 4:\u2014Guide du visiteur du Mus\u00e9e de Boulaq:\u2014and, Etudes Egyptiennes, fasc. 3:\u2014Brugsch, Thesaurus Inscr. \u00c6gypt. Abtheil. 3:\u2014Loftie, Essay on Scarabs:\u2014Dr. Birch, Cat. of Egyptian Antiquities at Alnwick:\u2014Lenormant, F., Civilisation, M\u0153urs et Mons. de l'Egypte (vol. 3 of Histoire Ancienne):\u2014Schia-parelli, Monumenti Egiziani rinvenuti di recente in Roma.\n\nEpigraphy.\u2014The most important work of the last year has\nbeen the publication of the second part of the great French \"Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum,\" which was, as we ventured to anticipate (Report 1883, p. cxvii), presented to the Oriental Congress at Leyden on Sept. 10. It is needless to discuss its merits here: suffice it, that the grand work done by the French scholars in 1882 has been thoroughly well sustained, in their last publication, tomus i. fasc. 2. This fasciculus is illustrated by a volume of plates, xv\u2014xxxvi, quite equal to those issued with the first part. We trust that a work, so justly appreciated by all true scholars, may be successfully carried out with as little delay as possible.\n\nIn the Indian Antiquary, Mr. Fleet has continued his valuable researches, and has published Sanskrit and Old Canarese Inscriptions, Nos. 127\u2014145:\u2014to Professor B\u00fchler we, also, owe a notice of the Dbiniki Grant of King J\u0101ikadeva (June); of the Rathor Grants No. 3 (July); of that of Dharanivah\u0101ra of Vadhv\u0101n (ibid); and of the Ilichpur Grant of Pravaras\u0113na II. of Vakataka (Sept.). In July is a paper by H. H. Dhruva, on a copper-plate grant of King Trilochanapala Chalukya of Latudesa, dated Saka 972, A.D. 1050. In the same number Dr. A. F. H. Hoernle replies, and most courteously, to the views promulgated by Prof. Bhandarkar with reference to the Gatha Dialects, and Mr. Rehatsek writes on an epitaph from Aden. In August Mr. Fleet deals with Rajapitamah\u0101, the Silahart title:\u2014and, in October, is a continuation of M. S\u00e9nart\u2019s papers under the title of the \"Column Inscription of Piyadasi.\" From Dr. Hultszch, we have a notice of \"A grant of Krishna II. of Ankulesvar, dated A.D. 888: of Karnata Grants No. 1: A grant of Venkata II., A.D. 1636: A note on a Bhauma-Yantra: and, Karnata Grants, No. 2, a grant of Ranga II., dated A.D. 1644\u20145.\n\nIn January, 1884, the Rev.

Renan's appeal in favour of the preservation of Egyptian monuments. Lastly, in May 5, we have a notice of M. Maspero's forthcoming Guide to the Museum at Boulaq.\n\nThe Revue Egyptologique continues to publish many valuable and well-illustrated papers. Thus, IIIe Ann. No. 1, contains papers by M.

M\u00fcller's Ancient Inscriptions in Ceylon; and, from the same Journal, we hear that there is now good hope that the Acad. d. Inscriptions will be able to publish the collection of Arabic Inscriptions collected, during several years, with such zeal by Mr. Doughty.\n\nNumismatics.\u2014The record, this year, for Numismatics, is not so full as on former occasions; but we may note, in the Academy, Aug. 11, an important paper by E. T. Rogers Bey, entitled \"A new Revelation on Early Kufic Coins,\" the point being that the French collection has been recently enriched, from that formerly in the possession of Soubhi Pasha, by several dirhams, one earlier by 37 years than any one previously known. In Jan. 5, Mr. S. L. Poole, M.R.A.S., gives a full and careful review of M. Sauvaire's \"Mat\u00e9riaux pour servir \u00e0 l'histoire de la Numismatique et de la M\u00e9trologie Musulmanes,\" a collected volume of papers originally published in the Journal Asiatique.

L. Poole has written a paper entitled, \"The Arabian historians of Mohammedan Numismatics,\" which is, in fact, the substance of M. Sauvaire's work, \"Mat\u00e9riaux pour servir \u00e0 l'histoire de la Numismatique et de la M\u00e9trologie Musulmanes.\"\n\nIn the Journ. of the Bengal Asiatic Society (lii. pt. 1,\nM. Renan presented a Carthaginian Inscription (tarif des Sacrifices), found by M. Delattre (see ante, Berger. Proc. Bibl. Arch. Soc., March 4):\u2014Aug. 24, M. Ledrain notices a Phoenician Inscription in the Louvre:\u2014and, in Aug. 31, Ganneau speaks of some Phoenician Monuments in the British Museum:\u2014in Sept. 14, M.

S\u00e9nart of the oldest Religious Edict of Asoka, first published in 1877: M. S\u00e9nart agrees with MM. B\u00fchler and Oldenberg:\u2014On April 9, M. Renan gives Punic Inscriptions on amphori discovered by M. Delattre. In the Journal des Savants, July, the late M. F. Lenormant writes \u201cLes Inscriptions Hittites,\u201d being a review of an article by Prof. Sayce in \u201cFraser,\u201d Aug. 1880, and in vol. vii. of the Trans. Bibl. Arch\u00e6ol. Soc. This must have been one of the latest papers he completed.\n\nThe most important separate book published during last year (after the French \u2018Corpus,\u2019 already alluded to) is Mr. Euting\u2019s Sammlung d. Karthagischen Inschriften, at present plates only:\u2014M. de Vog\u00fc\u00e9 has also published his \u201cInscriptions Palmyreniennes in\u00e9dites,\u201d and M. Amador de los Rios, Memoria acerca de algunas inscriptiones Arabigas de Espa\u00f1a y Portugal:\u2014E. T. Rogers Bey has, also, printed a brief \u201cM\u00e9moire sur certaines Inscriptions en caract\u00e8res Coufiques carr\u00e9s. In the last list of presents we acknowledged the receipt of Mr. Isaac Taylor\u2019s \u201cThe Alphabet,\u201d which is a mine of general information of what other scholars have done before him, with many clever and acute suggestions, the result of his own extensive reading and research. The long discussion on this intricate subject at the Leyden Congress shows, however, that scholars have not as yet made up their minds about the origin of the Alphabet, used in the general sense of this word. In the Athen\u00e6um of July, 1883, is a\nAmawee Khaleefahs, by Surgeon-Major O. Codrington, M.D., M.R.A.S.:\u2014On the Coinage of El Harar in East Africa, by Lieut.-Col. Prideaux, and \u201cOn Copper Coins of the Bahmani Dynasty,\u201d by Surgeon-Major O. Codrington, M.D., M.R.A.S.\n\nOf books, the only one we have this year to notice as of importance is that by Mr. S. L. Poole, 8th vol. of the \u201cCatalogue of Oriental Coins in the British Museum,\u201d containing chiefly a description of the Coins of the Ottoman Turks, with a notice of the Crimean war medals, and a table drawn up by E. J. W. Gibbs, M.R.A.S., showing the growth and chief divisions of the Ottoman Empire. The Cat. d. Num. Afdeeling van het Museum Batav. Genootschap tweede druk (published, it would seem, in 1877, but only just to hand) is interesting for its coins of the Extreme East.\n\nThe Trustees of the British Museum have bought the collection of Chinese Coins made by C. T. Gardner, Esq., M.R.A.S., H.M. Consul, Ichang.\n\nMr. Barclay V. Head, M.R.A.S., has received the Prix-Hauteroche this year.\n\nAfrica.\u2014There is comparatively little to record under this head on this occasion, but M.

J. Rodgers published (with an engraving) a Nis\u00e1r of Shah Jahan in the Museum at Dehli. In July, August and November are notices of coins recently acquired under the provisions of the Treasure Trove Act. Dr. Hoernle, also, exhibited an interesting gold coin found in the ruins of Gaur, and believed to be one of Shir Sh\u00e1h, and, also, two gold coins procured by Mr. Rivett Carnac, one of which, of the Gupta series, has been presented by him to the British Museum. Dr. Hoernle, also, described a new find of Muhammadan Coins of Bengal, including hitherto unknown ones of Mahmud Shah I. and of Barbak Sh\u00e1h.

As, however, no official account has as yet been published of the work of the various sections, a detailed account of it must be reserved for the Report of next year.\nall he possibly could by being present and assisting the Council and Secretary in all their work towards the furtherance of the objects of this great Society. And it was a great Society, for he thought that this country was unduly indifferent to its obligations in the matter of Oriental literature. This country was so bound up, commercially, socially, and morally with India, that it was a matter of regret and surprise that the nation, as a nation, took so small an interest in Oriental subjects, and that, when they wanted information on many such matters, they had to go to Germany or some other foreign country, wherein a deeper interest was taken in Oriental affairs than with us. In this respect he considered the nation owed much to the Royal Asiatic Society for promoting the culture of Oriental sciences and literature, and he trusted that, in this respect, it would even do more in the future than it had done in the past.\n\nProfessor Monier Williams, C.I.E., who had specially come from Oxford to give to the meeting some account of his recent visit to India and the Jaina and Buddhist temples there, was next called upon by the President to address the meeting. The Professor, who met with a cordial reception, said:\u2014Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u2014First, let me say that I have had great pleasure in hearing, in the report read by your Secretary, the reference to my late friend Mr. Eastwick. In the second place, let me say how delighted I am to see my friend Sir William Muir in the chair which he now occupies as President of your Society. He is, if I may say so, a square man in a square hole, and I am very much pleased to see him there. Next, it is expected that I should give you some account of my late travels in India, and I am told that I am to be limited to half an hour. Therefore, perhaps you will allow me to speak from notes, that I may the more rapidly address you. Let me first say that, notwithstanding my repeated visits to India, I feel more diffidence than ever in speaking before many here present,\nhe entertain the hope of being able to do so in the future. Under these circumstances, the Council have considered the qualifications of one of the greatest Orientalists in this country or in Europe, and they have come to the conclusion that no one could better fulfil the duties of President, or do more honour to this Society, than Sir William Muir. His reputation is known, not only throughout this kingdom, but throughout Europe and Asia. I feel satisfied that he will meet all your expectations, and that he will carry on the affairs of this Society in the same efficient manner as they have been for many years past. I have great pleasure in handing over to him\u2014vicariously, I should add\u2014a most efficient Council and Secretary. Nothing could exceed the efficiency of either. As for our Secretary, he has performed his duties with assiduity and ability. I may say, indeed, that by his energy he has raised the Society to our present flourishing condition, with a Journal too, for the last four years, issued quarterly. I have no doubt that Mr. Vaux will continue his labours under Sir William Muir in the same manner as heretofore. Without, therefore, trespassing any further on your time, I will now call upon our new President to take the chair. (Sir Henry Rawlinson then vacated the chair, which was taken by the President, Sir William Muir.)\n\nThe President, in returning thanks for his election, said it was a great pleasure to him to receive such an honour. At the same time, they must all regret the reason of the absence from their midst of their former President, who was unable to continue the office for another term, to the great advancement of the interests of the Society, as they all believed. As for himself, they had done him (the President) a great honour, the more so as he had to confess to deficiency in times past in his attention to the affairs of the Society. He could only say that it would be his endeavour, while he held the office that they had done him the honour to confer upon him, to \"turn over a new leaf,\" and do\nall he possibly could by being present and assisting the Council and Secretary in all their work towards the furtherance of the objects of this great Society. And it was a great Society, for he thought that this country was unduly indifferent to its obligations in the matter of Oriental literature. This country was so bound up, commercially, socially, and morally with India, that it was a matter of regret and surprise that the nation, as a nation, took so small an interest in Oriental subjects, and that, when they wanted information on many such matters, they had to go to Germany or some other foreign country, wherein a deeper interest was taken in Oriental affairs than with us.

Therefore, perhaps you will allow me to speak from notes, that I may the more rapidly address you. Let me first say that, notwithstanding my repeated visits to India, I feel more diffidence than ever in speaking before many here present,\nwho are much better acquainted with India than I am, and have done far better work there. Still India is changing so rapidly that many who left it even a few years ago will be interested in what I have to tell them. And, first, a few words about the Calcutta International Exhibition. During my stay of nearly a month, I went there almost every day. The Indian portion was in temporary buildings on the Maid\u0101n, opposite the Imperial Museum, and the non-Indian portion in the Museum itself and annexes. No one could have foreseen that the natives of all classes would have crowded into the Indian portion as they did, willingly paying their four annas each, not only men, but women; for one of the remarkable things was that the Exhibition opened the doors of many Zenanas. The women insisted on coming.\n\nTo one standing on the bridge connecting the Indian and non-Indian sections, the sight was extraordinary, and to both ethnologists and philologists afforded valuable lessons. A motley crowd of all peoples, races, tribes and castes, clothed in every variety of bright costume, and looking like a moving flower garden, pressed eagerly through the turnstiles, giving forth a confused Babel of loud voices in an infinite variety of dialects. Almost all thronged over the bridge towards the Indian portion. The non-Indian section, except, perhaps, the Australian, attracted few visitors. One great use of the Exhibition was that it seemed to teach the people to appreciate their own manufactures, arts and industries. In this way, I think, many extinct industries will be revived, and many new ones introduced. One had only to look at the beautiful wooden gates inlaid with T\u016br-work, sent by Mr. Growse, from Bulandshahr, and the magnificent carved stone gateway, sent by Major Keith, M.R.A.S., from Gwalior, to be convinced of this. Nor must I omit to mention how interested I was in the economic court of Dr. Watt, with its 5000 different varieties of rice, and its unique collection of Indian products, from silks to poison, and its wonderful\nW. Jones in 1784), which occurred while I was at Calcutta. A special meeting in celebration of the event took place at the fine rooms of the Society in Park Street, and a dinner afterwards. The Viceroy was present at the dinner, and made an excellent speech, and Mr. Reynolds, the President, gave an epitome of the history of the Society, speaking eulogistically of a galaxy of illustrious members of the Bengal Society, well known to all of us here\u2014Jones, Colebrooke, Carey, Harrington, H. H. Wilson, Brian Hodgson, James and H. T. Prinsep, Torrens, and many others, and referring to the Centenary Review of the history of the Society, written for the occasion by Dr. R\u0101jendral\u0101la Mitra. In replying to the toast of \"The Guests,\" I ventured to allude to my personal reminiscences of one specially honoured in this Society, whose portrait I see before me, our former President and Director, H. H. Wilson. Let me repeat to you what I said of him:\u2014\"I remember when I was a youngster, soon after I received my appointment in the Indian Civil Service, I was made to go and call on Horace Hayman Wilson, and my boyish exclamation on leaving his presence was\u2014'What a dry old stick!' But I soon found out that beneath that 'dry' exterior a warmer and truer heart never throbbed, and that the 'stick' possessed an intellect as pointed as the Kusha-grass (Ku\u015b\u0101gra-buddhi), and full of the fire of genius, like the Vedic Ar\u0101\u1e47i. His death was to me like the death of a father; and I have ever since been an ardent worshipper of his memory and a humble follower in his footsteps.\"\n\nAnd, now, allow me to take you, for a few minutes, to two or three other places visited by me before I left India in March last. First, Darjeeling:\u2014I cannot help expressing my admiration of the engineers who constructed the marvellous railway, or, rather, steam tramway, from Silliguri right up to the heights which command the view of Mount Everest and Kinchingunga, the two highest moun-\nplaced on the ground, with one foot. Another great object of interest to me was the Burmese theatre. A play was being acted every day, or, rather, the same continuous play, which was no other than the story of R\u0101ma, from the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a. It was to last for 28 days at least, and consisted chiefly of a dialogue between R\u0101ma and S\u012bt\u0101, who kept circling round a small shrub stuck in the ground, which, I suppose, represented the forest to which R\u0101ma was banished. R\u0101ma occasionally smoked a cigar and varied his dialogue by stopping to expectorate. S\u012bt\u0101 was dressed in a tight dress, very like that worn by the women painted on the old willow pattern china. She now and then gave us a dance, so far as the limited range of her tight dress would allow. Some of the performers wore masks, and a band of musicians interposed at intervals with a discordant din. Then there was the Beng\u0101li-P\u0101\u1e6dha-\u015b\u016bla, or indigenous school, in a little annex, where twice a week boys were taught before a crowd of spectators. First, there was the chanting of the multiplication table by all the boys, in a shrill scream. Then the Palm-leaf class wrote the alphabet and tables on palm-leaves. Next, the Plantain-leaf class wrote sentences on plantain leaves. After that came the Paper class, where paper was used for writing. Then the printed book class, when a few printed books were used. Finally, the boys sang a hymn to the Goddess of Learning (Sarasvat\u012b), and to the Goddess of the Ganges (Gang\u0101). One of the most curious and instructive sights for a study of Indian life was to be seen in the refreshment sheds. Whether the Exhibition was personified or deified by the natives, and regarded as a kind of incarnation of Vishnu, who, as at Jagann\u0101th-puri, had the power of suspending caste, I know not; but, certainly, eating went on in these sheds with perfect freedom, and without fear of contamination from European eyes.\n\nAnd now permit me to say a few words about the centenary of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (founded by Sir\nsaid to be still there, but is no longer to be seen. It is incased by an entirely new brick structure, painted of a yellowish colour and resembling a huge Burmese pagoda, with a lofty central and two subordinate side towers. The central tower is 196 feet high, and crowned by a pointed umbrella-ornament, in seven tiers. The whole has cost a lac of rupees and is now quite finished, except that I noticed the remains of the bambu scaffolding over the entrance, where some projecting ornamentation has still to be completed.\n\nSpeaking in this place with little knowledge of art, and in the presence of Mr. Fergusson, I must leave Mr. Beglar to his tender mercies, but I trust Mr. Fergusson will allow me to express my admiration of Mr. Beglar as a most devoted and conscientious worker in the field of archaeology. Doubtless, after having, eight years ago, had the old temple and its surroundings impressed indelibly on my mind, I stood for some minutes astounded, not to say almost speechless and petrified with astonishment, on first beholding the transformation; but, on looking down on the spacious excavated quadrangle which surrounds the new structure, with its beautifully-carved stone railings, with its recently-unearthed side temples and tombs, with its sacred trees and innumerable images of Buddha in eight or nine different attitudes, with its myriads of votive stupas, small and large, piled one on the other in countless layers, I must confess that my feelings, in the end, experienced a revulsion. Whatever may be the verdict with regard to the restored temple, General Cunningham and Mr. Beglar have most assuredly accomplished a great work in these excavations. A more marvellous disentombment of a kind of necropolis is not to be seen anywhere else, not even in Pompeii. The old Pipal-tree was transplanted by Mr. Beglar to a neighbouring garden, and efforts were made to preserve it, but the Burmese pilgrims have, out of their excessive devotion, killed it by watering it with Eau-de-Cologne. Several\ntains of the world. The little engine, dragging a light train, whisks round curves, and describes figures of '8' on the brink of precipices, with the ease of a figure-skater on the ice. Near Darjeeling I gained a few ideas about the Buddhism of Tibet. I visited one of the nearest monasteries and temples, saw the prayer-wheels turned, the prayer-flags flying, the wandering mendicants with their damarus, and the wild dances of the masqueraders, imitating the demon dance of the Ganas of \u015aiva. The conclusion I came to was that the Bhutias, Lepchas, and Tibetans generally, know nothing of pure Buddhism. They mix it up with Hind\u016b superstitions, and really worship the image of Buddha as if he existed as a god ready and able to benefit them. Their chief religion consists in the fear of evil spirits. The numbers and variety of the amulets worn by the people who frequent the Darjeeling bazaars is remarkable, and the magical efficacy of the Dhurj or Vajra for scaring demons is an article of universal faith.\n\nNext, about my visit to Buddha Gay\u0101. This, in my opinion, is now one of the wonders of India, and, perhaps, one of the most interesting spots in the whole world. Here, as every one knows, was the sacred Pipal-tree, under which, after six years of austerity and meditation, the young Prince Gautama was converted into the Buddha, and from which, as from a central focus, radiated that faith which now claims more adherents than any other of the religions of the world. Here, when I visited the place in 1876, there was a striking tower-like pagoda, still in fair preservation, with a terrace round it, and a veritable descendant of the Buddha's Sacred Fig-tree, which some Burmese of high rank, who had come to see the Prince of Wales at Calcutta, were in the act of worshipping. Now, during the past two years, General Cunningham and Mr. Beglar, his assistant, have\u2014mirabile dictu\u2014changed all this, and no little abuse have they justly incurred in consequence. The old temple is\nsaid to be still there, but is no longer to be seen. It is incased by an entirely new brick structure, painted of a yellowish colour and resembling a huge Burmese pagoda, with a lofty central and two subordinate side towers. The central tower is 196 feet high, and crowned by a pointed umbrella-ornament, in seven tiers. The whole has cost a lac of rupees and is now quite finished, except that I noticed the remains of the bambu scaffolding over the entrance, where some projecting ornamentation has still to be completed.\n\nSpeaking in this place with little knowledge of art, and in the presence of Mr. Fergusson, I must leave Mr. Beglar to his tender mercies, but I trust Mr. Fergusson will allow me to express my admiration of Mr. Beglar as a most devoted and conscientious worker in the field of archaeology. Doubtless, after having, eight years ago, had the old temple and its surroundings impressed indelibly on my mind, I stood for some minutes astounded, not to say almost speechless and petrified with astonishment, on first beholding the transformation; but, on looking down on the spacious excavated quadrangle which surrounds the new structure, with its beautifully-carved stone railings, with its recently-unearthed side temples and tombs, with its sacred trees and innumerable images of Buddha in eight or nine different attitudes, with its myriads of votive stupas, small and large, piled one on the other in countless layers, I must confess that my feelings, in the end, experienced a revulsion. Whatever may be the verdict with regard to the restored temple, General Cunningham and Mr. Beglar have most assuredly accomplished a great work in these excavations. A more marvellous disentombment of a kind of necropolis is not to be seen anywhere else, not even in Pompeii. The old Pipal-tree was transplanted by Mr. Beglar to a neighbouring garden, and efforts were made to preserve it, but the Burmese pilgrims have, out of their excessive devotion, killed it by watering it with Eau-de-Cologne. Several\nof these pilgrims were worshipping before the principal image of Buddha in the shrine at the basement of the great tower when I entered. They bowed down and touched the stone floor, and presented a curious mixture of offerings, consisting of rice, flowers, tin boxes of sardines, Huntley and Palmer's biscuits, Eau-de-Cologne, and packets of gold leaf, all the time intoning prayers. After finishing their worship, they occupied themselves for several hours in gilding the image with the gold leaf. I noticed that just behind the temple a rich Buddhist from Ceylon had quite recently set up a large horizontal stone tablet, with an inscription giving the old date of the Nirv\u0101\u1e47a of Buddha, B.C. 543, not accepting new theories. On the right of the temple entrance is a raised platform of earth with a Pipal-tree growing on it, and idols of Vish\u1e47u and \u015aiva set up under it. Here two or three groups of Hindus were performing Sr\u0101ddhas with balls of rice, while some Buddhist pilgrims stood near, worshipping the tree. It struck me as an interesting exemplification of the intertwining of Buddhism with Hinduism and their interconnection and mutual toleration.\n\nOne of my chief objects in visiting India this time was to learn more about the Jains, and I am bound to confess that I learnt very little beyond what I knew already, for the Jains themselves are very ignorant of their own religion. Yet I went to some of their most sacred places, especially to the Hill of P\u0101ras-n\u0101\u1e6dh and Mount Abu. The former is called \u015aikhar, and is held by the Jains to be their most sacred place of pilgrimage in India. The reason is that more Jainas or Tirtham-karas have attained beatitude at P\u0101ras-n\u0101\u1e6dh than anywhere else. Hence, it is crowded with shrines of the 24 Jaina saints. The finest shrine at the very top had been recently struck by lightning and nearly destroyed. Long lines of pilgrims, in bright-coloured dresses, continually passed me. They toil up the whole height of 4500 feet, and neither eat nor drink till their\nThe Society of Antiquaries.\n\u2014 Zoological Society of London.\n\u2014 Linnean Society of London.\n\u2014 Numismatic Society of London.\n\u2014 Statistical Society of London.\n\u2014 London Institution.\n\u2014 Anthropological Institute.\n\u2014 Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.\n\u2014 Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.\n\u2014 United Service Institution.\n\u2014 Society of Arts.\n\u2014 Society of Biblical Archaeology.\n\u2014 Cambridge Philosophical Society.\n\u2014 Hellenic Society.\n\u2014 Historical Society of Lancashire and Cheshire.\n\u2014 Literary and Scientific Institution of Liverpool.\n\u2014 Philosophical Society of Manchester.\n\u2014 Society for Psychical Researches.\n\u2014 Proprietors of the Canadian Journal of Science.\n\u2014 Seismological Society of Japan.\n\u2014 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique de Paris.\n\u2014 G\u00e9ographique de Paris.\n\u2014 de la G\u00e9ographie de Bordeaux.\n\u2014 Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences de Montpellier.\n\u2014 Royal Academy of Belgium.\n\u2014 Academy of Turin.\n\u2014 Academy \"dei Lincei\" of Rome.\n\u2014 Academy of Berlin.\n\u2014 Academy of Vienna.\n\u2014 Academy of Munich.\n\u2014 German Oriental Society.\n\u2014 Geographical Society of Berlin.\n\u2014 University of Bonn.\n\u2014 Bataviasch Genootschap.\n\u2014 Konigl.

Both will, I trust, be resuscitated in some form or other. There is work for a whole army of archaeologists in India, and inscriptions enough for a thousand Mr. Fleets to decipher. With regard to the Indian Institute at Oxford, I am happy to tell you that I have brought back an immense number of specimens of the arts and produce of India, together with books for its library, and that the Supreme Government of Calcutta has assented to my proposal for founding six scholarships for deserving natives. This was one of my principal objects in making my recent journey, and I am now awaiting with some anxiety the approval of the Home Government, without which the scholars cannot be appointed.

Durand, and of Mr. Edwin Arnold's \"Indian Idylls.\"\n\n*Zend and Persian.*\u2014There has not been so much to record this year, as on some former occasions.\n\nHowever, in the *Athen\u00e6um*, June 16th, is a pleasant notice of a very pleasant book, Dr. C. J. Wills's \"In the Land of the Lion and the Sun,\" the chief result of its study being that the Persia of James Morier in 1823 is very much the same as that of 1883:\u2014In Feb. 2, 1884, is a very full review of Major H. G. Raverty's \"Tabakat-i-Nasiri, a general history of the Muhammadan Dynasties of Asia from A.D. 810 to A.D. 1260,\" a book, of value historically, if studied alongside of Briggs, Dow, Price, and of Sir Henry Elliot's compilations. One thing, however, greatly marring the value of Major Raverty's volumes, is, that he has not given to them an Index. It is nonsense to say (as Major Raverty says) that a scholar's time is \"too valuable\" to be employed in work a schoolboy could have done under his superintendence. From May 31, we learn that the noble collection of Oriental MSS. in the British Museum has been recently enriched by many valuable books, secured at the sale of the Library of the Comte de Gobineau, late French Ambassador at Teheran. We have not, however, space here, for any details of this most valuable purchase.\n\nIn the *Academy*, June 23, Mr. C. E. Wilson, M.R.A.S., reviews Dr. Wills's \"Land of the Lion and the Sun,\" already noted. In Aug. 18, is a brief\u2014too brief\u2014notice of the valuable Essays M. James Darmesteter has recently published under the modest title of \"Etudes Iraniennes\"\u2014the first volume deals with an historical grammar of the Persian language, from the time of Darius to that of Firdusi; the first part of the second volume contains critical reviews of various works on Iranian history and literature; while the\nsecond part supplies Pahlavi, Sanskrit and Persian Translations of some of the Yashts, etc., found in various MSS. in Paris and London. M. Darmesteter's work is as interesting as a novel. In Oct. Mr. C. E. Wilson also reviews, at great length, the Quatrains of Omar Khayyam by Mr. E. H. Whinfield, M.R.A.S., and discusses very carefully the question of the actual or probable belief of the writer; approving, on the whole, what Mr. Whinfield has accomplished, and generally his \"special felicity of interpretation.\" In May 21, 1884, is an important notice from Mr. Houtum Schindler, entitled \"A Visit to Khorassan,\" giving an account by S\u00e1ni-ed-douleh of a recent journey performed by him in Khorassan. Of course, we do not expect the Persian writer to be an archaeologist in the European sense of this word; but he has described fairly well the localities he visited. We rejoice to learn that Mr. C. E. Wilson has been appointed Reader of Persian at Cambridge.\n\nIn the Z.D.M.G. (37, 2), are papers by F. Teufel, on Babur und Abu Fazl; by R. Roth, Die Seelen des Mittelreichs im Parsismus; by M. de Harlez, Zur Erkl\u00e4rung des Avesta. In 37, 3, are papers by Bartholomae, Avestisch Mada-Mada:\u2014On Andreas's Book of the Mainyo-i-Khard; and H. Eth\u00e9, Neu Ir\u00e1n:\u2014In 38, 1, M. de Harlez publishes \"L'Avestique Mada et la tradition Persane.\"\n\nIn the Journal Asiatique, Fevr.-Mars, 1883, J. Darmesteter writes, \"Fragment d'un Commentaire sur le Vendidad Farg.2,\" and M. Chodzkiewicz describes \"Une tente Persane du xvi\u00b0 si\u00e8cle.\" In Ao\u00fbt-Sept. M. Halevy writes \"On the word Aspenj\":\u2014and in Jan. 1884, M. Barbier de Meynard reviews M. de Kazimirski's Dialogues Fran\u00e7ais-Persans.\n\nIn the Revue Critique (May, 1883) M. de Harlez reviews Hubschmann's Die Umschreibung d. Iranischen Sprachen, etc. In Nov. 26 is an excellent notice of the Rev. Lawrence H. Mills, and of the great work he is engaged on, viz. The Study of the Gathas (see p. 438):\u2014In Dec. 10, M. Darme-\nsteter gracefully reviews Miss Helen Zimmern's Epic of Kings, by Firdusi:\u2014In Dec. 17 is a notice of the Reprint of the Persian Text of the Sefer Nameh at Dehli, which is said to be very well done:\u2014In Feb. 4, 1884, M. Darmesteter reviews Andreas's Book of Mainyo-i-Khard, from a MS. at Copenhagen, procured by the late M. Westergaard:\u2014and in March 24 is a review by M. Br\u00e9al, of M. Bonet Maury's translation into French of the late Count de Noer's Akbar.\n\nWe may add that, in Ath\u00e9n\u00e9um Belge (Sept. 1883) M. de Harlez highly praises Geiger's \"Ost-Iranische Kultur\":\u2014in the D. Literaturzeitung for Oct. is a good notice by Zimmer, of Andreas's book:\u2014and in Nov., by Landauer, of Whinfield's Omar Khayyam.\n\nIn the Bulletin de l'Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e Orientale (1883, 1-2) M. Chodzko gives many extracts from the \"Vizir de Lenkeran,\" and points out its value; and (3 and 4) M. de Harlez deals further with Dr. W. Geiger's Ost-Iranische Cultur im Altertum.\n\nIn the M\u00e9langes Orientaux (dedicated to the Congress of Leyden) M. Schefer has printed \"Trois Chapitres du Khitay Nameh (in Persian and French).\n\nOf books relating to Persia, recently published, we may note the following: Whinfield, E., Quatrains of Omar Khayyam (2nd edition):\u2014Fitzgerald, C. (the late), Rubaiyat of Omar Khaiyyam:\u2014Harlez, M. de, L'Ex\u00e9g\u00e8se et la Correction des Textes Avestiques:\u2014Schefer, C., Chrestomathie Persane:\u2014E. H. Palmer's Concise Persian and English Dictionary, completed by Guy Le Strange, M.R.A.S.:\u2014Geldner, K. F., Drei Yasht aus dem Zendavesta:\u2014Barbier de Meynard, Boustan de Sadi:\u2014M. de Lagarde, Persische Studien:\u2014Abul-Fazl's Akbar-Namah, 3 vols., Lucknow, 2nd edition:\u2014Kazimirski, A. de B., Dialogues Fran\u00e7aise-Persanes, etc.:\u2014Chodzko, J., Grammaire de la Langue Persane, 2nd edition:\u2014West, E. W., Dadistan-i-Dinik and\nEpistles of Manus Kikar, Part 2:\u2014Fazl-i-Ali, Dictionary of English and Persian, Bombay:\u2014Rub\u00e2iyyat-i-Omar Khaiyyam, Lucknow:\u2014Rieu, C., Catalogue of the Persian MSS. in the British Museum, vol. iii.:\u2014and Robinson, Persian Poetry for English Readers.\n\nTurkish.\u2014From the Athen\u00e6um (Sept. 22) we learn that the Mijman-i-Funam, a scientific Magazine, started many years ago by Munif Pasha, but since suspended, has been resumed by him, and appears regularly in Constantinople:\u2014that Mazhar Effendi, who has been for some years lecturing in Turkish at the Imperial School of Medicine at Constantinople, has published his Lectures on Anatomy in a volume fully illustrated:\u2014and that there is now, also, publishing in Constantinople, a paper called the \"Osmanli,\" devoted to the architecture of Constantinople.\n\nFrom Dec. 15, we learn that Jaghatai, the literary language of the Eastern Turks, is being much studied at Constantinople, and that Sheikh Suleiman Effendi has produced a Dictionary in this language. It is hoped that in some of the old libraries old Jaghatai MSS. may yet be found. Vamb\u00e9ry discovered some, and Dr. Eth\u00e9 spoke at the Leyden Congress of a new text of the same class he hoped to be able to publish.\n\nIn the Academy for March 20, 1884, Mr. E. J. W. Gibb, M.R.A.S., gives a translation in English verse, line for line with the original, and with the preservation, as far as is possible, of the metre of the original Turkish, of a poem taken from a little volume called Zemzeme.\n\nIn the \"Melanges Orientaux\" M de Meynard has printed \"Notice de l'Arabie M\u00e9ridionale d'apr\u00e8s un document Turc.\"\n\nAmong books, may be mentioned MM. Chakri et Asgain, Dictionnaire Fran\u00e7.-Turc, Tome I:\u2014J. W. Redhouse, Engl.-Turk and Turk.-English Dictionary:\u2014and by the same, A Simplified Grammar of the Ottoman Turkish Lan-\nguage.\u2014E. J. W. Gibb, Translation of the History of Jewad.\u2014Faris ash Shidiak, a new Edition of his Grammar:\u2014and by M. du Rieu, Levini Warneri, De Rebus Turcicis epistol\u00e6 inedit\u00e6.\n\nWe should add that in the Revue Critique for April 14, 1884, is an account of the \"Almanach de l'Orient,\" published at Constantinople by M. A. Pal\u00e9ologue, with a notice of an interesting paper in it by M. Stavros Aristarchi, entitled \"Les Biblioth\u00e8ques Ottomanes \u00e0 Constantinople.\" Perhaps not every one is aware that there are sixty-eight public libraries in that City. A catalogue of the Library of the Hamidieh has just been issued by the Minister of Public Instruction.\n\nKurdish.\u2014In Z.D.M.G. (38. i.) is a long article by Mr. A. Houtum-Schindler, entitled Beitr\u00e4ge zur Kurdischen Wortschatze.\n\nChina Review.\u2014This journal has kept up during the past year its well-established reputation. Thus, in vol. xi. No. 5, March and April, 1883, Mr. Dyer Ball continues his \"Scraps from Chinese Mythology,\" and Dr. Edkins his \"Notes on some Chinese Works.\" There are, also, a large number of papers of varying interest, such as (by an anonymous writer) \"On the so-called blockade of Hong-Kong,\" in which the defects at present existing in the Junk Trade are clearly pointed out, and some remedies for the same indicated: Dr. S. W. Bushell, M.R.A.S., also writes, \"On the Mongol mark on Porcelain:\"\u2014and M. G. von Gabelentz with reference to his Chinese grammar. Some brief but good notices of books are added, which will be of use to students of Chinese matters.\n\nIn No. 5, May and June, Mr. C. H. Piton continues his account of China during the Tsin Dynasty, A.D. 264-419 and Mr. Dyer Ball his \"Scraps from Chinese Mythology:\"\nability the Chinese style of writing (known in this country as the small seal character), the Siao-chuan, as it existed about the Christian era, with the explanations, often childish, of the native authors. It is to be regretted that Dr. Chalmers, at least in his preface, has not thought fit to give some information on the older styles of writing which have been used in succession previously to the Siao-chuan. It is worthy of note as a remarkable instance of painstaking perseverance that Dr. Chalmers is able to say \"that every character in the volume has been written for the lithographer with the author's own hand:\" the work was compiled in China and printed in Scotland during a short stay of the author at home. This number contains, also, a few notices of books relating to China and Japan, such as, of Mr. W. G. Dixon's \"Land of the Morning\"\u2014\"Cochin Chine Fran\u00e7aise, Excursions et Reconnaissances,\" etc., etc.\n\nVol. xii. No. 2, Sept. and Oct., contains papers by Messrs. J. H. Stewart Lockhart, Dr. Edkins, R. H. Graves, G. Jamieson, and B. C. Henry. Dr. Edkins writes on the vexed question of the \"Yi-king, with notes on the Sixty-four Kwa,\" which he evidently considers to have been in some sense a \"book of divination,\" or, at all events, to have been used for this purpose, divination having been in common use in China before and during the time of Confucius. In this paper, Dr. Edkins deals with the first 29 Kwas. Mr. Graves writes on \"Aryan Roots in Chinese,\" taking for his basis those given in Prof. Skeat's \"Etymological Dictionary,\" and, for Chinese, the \"Cantonese Colloquial,\" the connections suggested being, as might be expected, rather with Sanskrit than with any other Aryan tongue\u2014perhaps, too, it may be added, that his conclusions are not very convincing. Mr. Jamieson's paper \"On the tributary Nations of China,\" has some interest at the present time, as showing what was and is the habit of the Greater Empire in dealing with the smaller states which pay tribute to her, the general conclu-\n\nVOL. XVI.\u2014[NEW SERIES.]\nsion being that the connection between the two may be best described as a \"Relationship at Will, begun at will, continued at will, and therefore terminable at will.\" There is, also, a curious notice of the ceremonies to be observed on the occasion of investing a Corean Prince as king. Mr. B. C. Henry completes his account of a \"Journey through Hainan,\" a curious record of well-attempted though unsuccessful travel. There is, also, a good review of Professor Beal's Fo-Sho-Hing-Tsang, or Life of Buddha (Sacred Books of the East, vol. xix.), and of Colonel Money's \"Cultivation and Manufacture of Tea.\" From the latter we learn that India is now pressing China hard, on what was long her peculiar and especial source of wealth. Thus, from 1879 to 1882, the Indian export of tea has risen from 35 millions of pounds to 51 millions, while, on the other hand, the Chinese export has fallen off by 12 millions, i.e. 125 millions in the first year, and 113 millions in the second.\n\nVol. xii. No. 3, Nov. Dec. In this No. Messrs. Piton and Dyer Ball continue their former papers, the other contributors being Messrs. Henry, E. H. Parker, R. Eichler, and E. L. Oxenham. Mr. Henry in his paper \"On eight Lions of Canton,\" points out that the number \"eight\" has, for some reason, had a special influence in Chinese Philosophy till, at length, in Canton, this influence has been crystallized around certain objects, and has found concrete expression in what has been designated as the \"Eight great Sights\" of that city. The whole paper is very curious. Mr. E. H. Parker's notice of the Winchow Dialect is valuable philologically, in that we learn from it that, with the exception of the letter r, \"every letter in the English (we may indeed say, in the European and Sanskrit) alphabet is found as an initial.\" The rest of the paper is technical, and of value chiefly to Chinese scholars; it, at the same time, shows earnest study, and a remarkable acquaintance with the vernaculars of Southern China. There are, as usual, some\ngood notices of books, such as that of the new Edition of Dr. S. Wells Williams's \"Middle Kingdom.\" Mr. Williams was a distinguished Scholar, as well as Missionary, and the President of the American Oriental Society, at the time of his recent and lamented death.\n\nVol. xii. No. 4, Jan. and Feb. 1884, contains continuations of former papers by H. Dyer Ball, Esq., and Charles Piton, Esq., and others by Messrs. Arendt, G. M. H. Playfair, A. A. Fauvel and Kleinwachter. Of these Mr. Arendt contributes three papers\u2014\"On the Mother of Mencius,\" which is curious; Chiang-Yi's \"Apologues of the Fox and the Tiger and the Dog,\" and Su Tai's \"Apologue of the Bittern and the Mussel\": Mr. Playfair gives in verse, a translation of \"A song to encourage Thrift\" (which however scarcely does so), by Governor-General Chiang.\u2014M. A. A. Fauvel gives an interesting account of \"Chinese Plants in Normandy:\"\u2014M. Kleinwachter adds a good notice of the \"History of Formosa under the Chinese Government\" down to the present time. There is, also, an excellent review of Mr. H. A. Giles's \"Gems of Chinese Literature.\"\n\nBesides the China Review, and other periodicals, such as the Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal, which we have no room to analyse in the present Report, a considerable number of papers, essays, and books have been issued from the press during the last year, to some of which attention will now be called. In the Athen\u00e6um (Aug. 11) is a brief but good notice of Dr. Eitel's Chinese Dictionary in the Cantonese dialect, parts iii. and iv.; and, from the same Journal, we learn (March 1, 1884) that Mr. D. C. Boulger, M.R.A.S., has read a paper before the Society of Arts entitled, \"Reflections on Chinese History, with reference to the present situation of affairs,\" and Dr. Zerffi, F.R.S.L., a paper, \"On the Tchong-Yong of Confucius,\" before the Roy. Hist. Soc.:\u2014from March 29, that M. Billequin has translated M. Malgutty's \"Elementary Chemistry\"\ninto Chinese, and that this work has been published at the College of Pekin under the auspices of the Chinese Government, the preface to it having been written by the First Minister, His Excellency Tong Lung. The same scholar has also translated Fresenius's \"Chemical Analysis.\" Mr. Herbert Spencer's \"Education\" has, also, just been rendered into Chinese by Y. K. Yen (May 17).\n\nIn the Academy (July 21) is an able letter by Dr. Edkins \"On criticism of Early Chinese Literature,\" in which he replies to some of Prof. T. de Lacouperie's objections, and speaks in high terms of the scholarship of the Chinese Minister in this country, the Marquis Tseng:\u2014and, in July 28, Sept. 1, and Oct. 6, Prof. de Lacouperie gives three letters, successively entitled, \"Early Chinese Literature,\" \"The Affinity of the Ten Stems of the Chinese Cycle with the Akkadian Numerals,\" and \"The Chinese Mythical Kings and the Babylonian Canon,\" in the first of which he replies to Dr. Edkins, and, in the other two, enforces by abundant examples and illustrations his original view of the connection of the civilization of South-Western Asia with China. This he has well summarized in the following words: \"The Chinese mythical list of Kings is based on the early Babylonian Canon, and reproduces the first Dynasty of Eighty-six Kings mentioned by Berosus, as well as many legends and historical facts of the same period.\" In Oct. 20 is a very interesting, though perhaps not entirely exact, letter by Dr. Edkins on \"The Early History of Cochin-China.\" In Nov. 17, Prof. T. de Lacouperie returns to his main subject in a letter entitled, \"Traditions of Babylonia in Early Chinese Documents,\" which gives some more details about the fragments of the Babylonian Canon, scattered among the Chinese traditions of the Mythical period. These we hear will be yet more fully dealt with in a work he has in the press. In December 29 Professor Douglas reviews the new Edition of the late\nProfessor S. Wells Williams's \"Middle Kingdom,\" in which the useful portion of the revised work is well pointed out. [See also, in \"Tr\u00fcbner's Record,\" Nos. 191-2, p. 100, a severe stricture on this work by H. A. Giles.] In the same number, also, is a short notice of Dr. Eitel's Dictionary, in which, while praising highly the whole, the reviewer shows there are many errors which ought not to have been left uncorrected:\u2014in Jan. 12 of Mr. Dyer Ball's \"Cantonese made easy,\" and \"Easy Lessons in the Hakka Dialect\":\u2014in Feb. 9 Dr. Edkins writes on \"The Chinese Cycles of Ten, Twelve, and Twenty-Eight,\" in which, admitting that all these Cycles \"are more or less remotely connected with the West,\" he remarks that the Silk Trade \"would render the communication of Babylonian knowledge possible in China.\"\n\nIn Feb. 23 Prof. Douglas reviews Mr. H. A. Giles's \"Gems of Chinese Literature,\" in which, while allowing the general goodness of this scholar's work, he would like to feel sure \"of what we have in every case before us, whether an accurate translation or only a paraphrase\":\u2014In March 1, March 8, and March 15, M. de Harlez and M. de Lacouperie discourse amicably \"The origin of Chinese Civilization.\"\n\nBefore the British Association for the Advancement of Science, at their meeting at Southport, Sept., 1883, Mr. W. Hancock read a paper, \"On North Formosa,\" and Mr. H. S. Hallett, \"On the advance of the Southern Chinese.\"\n\nIn the Journ. R. A. S. Vol. XV. Pt. 3, Prof. Beal, M.R.A.S., has printed \"Two sites named by Hiouen-Thsang in the 10th Book of the Si-yu-ki;\" and, in Vol. XVI. Pt. 2, \"Some further gleanings from the Si-yu-ki\":\u2014Mr. H. H. Howorth, M.R.A.S., has also issued \"The Northern Frontagers of China, Part VI. Hia or Tangut,\" in Vol. XV. Pt. 3.\n\nIn the Journal Asiatique (Ao\u00fbt-Septembre) M. Imbault-Huart continues his \"Miscellan\u00e9es Chinois, fragments d'un\nvoyage dans la province du Kiang-sou\u201d:\u2014(Oct.-Nov.-Dec.) M. Edouard Specht writes on Etudes sur l\u2019Asie Centrale d\u2019apr\u00e8s les Historiens Chinois:\u2014M. Imbault-Huart (Jan. 1884) further continues his previous paper. Scattered in other Journals, etc., may be noted Dr. Legge\u2019s Tao Teh King, in the British Quarterly Review (July 1, 1883):\u2014Ditto, On Mencius, Encyclop. Brit. (vol. xvi.):\u2014In the Proc. of the American Or. Soc., Prof. B. S. Lyman has written, \u201cOn certain Sounds in the Peking Pronunciation of Chinese.\u201d We may add to these, Duchateau, Sur l\u2019ancien Nom Serique (Athen. Orient. 1, 2):\u2014Hoskiaer, V., Routes Commerc. de Yunnan (Danish Roy. Geog. Soc.):\u2014Scott, W., Ting-huan-tschu (Erdkunde in Kurz darstellung) (Sitz. Berl. Ak. d Wissensch. May 31):\u2014Prof. T. Campbell, On the laws of Phonetic Change in the Khitan Languages (Proc. of the Canadian Institute). In the \u201cM\u00e9langes Orientaux,\u201d M. Cordier has printed an \u201cEssai d\u2019une Bibliographie des ouvrages publi\u00e9s en Chine par les Europ\u00e9ens au xvii\u00b0 et au xviii\u00b0 si\u00e8cle.\u201d\n\nIn the Annales de l\u2019Extr\u00eame Orient, the following papers may be noticed:\u2014Thus (July, 1883), M. de Lucy-Fossarieu gives an account of \u201cLes Codes de la Cochin-Chine et du Camboge\u201d:\u2014In the September No. is a severe judgment on Li-Hun-Chang and the Chinese Army, by an anonymous writer:\u2014In Jan., 1884, is a brief account of \u201cLes Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Secr\u00e8tes de la Chine;\u201d of the Commerce of Lower Cochin-China; and of an interesting journey made by Capt. Gautier into the wild country of the Mois:\u2014In Feb. is an article on the Emperor of China and his Court:\u2014In March is a notice of a translation from Ta-Tsing-Hwei-Tien, by Dr. G. Jamieson, of Shanghai, to the effect that the presents sent with various European Ambassadors have always been considered by the Chinese historians as so many tributes! In the same number is a translation of a paper read by Mr. C. H. Lepper, M.R.A.S., before the British Association at\nSouthampton, in 1882, entitled, \"The question of an Overland Route to China from India.\"\n\nMr. Henri Cordier has published a double number, January to June, of his valuable \"Revue de l'Extr\u00eame Orient,\" second year, in which there are several articles of interest: as, Les Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 Shanghai en 1853-1855, \u00e9pisodes du si\u00e8ge de Shanghai par les Imperiaux, par M. Arthur Millac.\u2014A continuation by the editor, of his series of \"Documents in\u00e9dits pour servir \u00e0 l'histoire eccl\u00e9siastique de l'Extr\u00eame Orient.\" The two principal documents are: a \"Memorial du Tsang-tou ou Gouverneur-General des deux provinces du Fan-Kien et de Tche-Kiang, appel\u00e9 Monan, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 contre la religion chr\u00e9tienne \u00e0 l'Empereur de la Chine, vers la fin de 1723;\" from the Archives of the French foreign office. The second document, which is in the British Museum, is a \"Catalogus Omnium Missionariorum qui Sinarum Imperium ad h\u00e6c usque tempora ad tradicandum Jesu Xti Evangelium ingressi sunt.\"\u2014Add to these, \"M\u00e9moires tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressantes sur la Royaume de Mien (Burma),\" translated from the Chinese by the celebrated Mgr. Claude de Visdelou, a MS. in the collection of the British Museum; and Dr. Ch. J. Martin's \"Notes sur le Massacre de Tien-tsin.\"\u2014The editor publishes under the title of \"Le Consulat de France \u00e0 Hu\u00e9,\" a series of documents and official correspondence which he has collected from the French Archives. In the same number there is a rather unfavourable review of \"Corea, the Hermit Nation,\" by W. J. Griffis;\u2014an interesting note on the suppressed book on the \"Expedition de Chine par le Comte d'H\u00e9risson\"; and, a bibliography, with an interesting review, drawing the attention of continental scholars to the various writings of Prof. de Lacouperie and to his opinions on the derivation of the Chinese civilisation from Western Asia.\n\nThe following books may be noticed:\u2014Schlegel, Nederl. Chin. Woord. boek. Deel. iii. Aflev. 3, 1884:\u2014Gabelenz, G. v., Anfangsgr\u00fcnde d. Chines. Grammatik, an excellent little\ngrammar simplified from his larger work:\u2014Edkins, J., Religion in China, 2nd Ed.:\u2014St. Denys, Hervey de, Matouan-lin, Ethnographie des Peuples Etrangers: David, Journal d\u2019Exploration dans l\u2019Empire Chinois:\u2014McGowan, J., Engl. and Chin. Dicty. of the Amoy Dialect:\u2014Do., Manual of the Amoy Colloquial:\u2014Ball, T. Dyer, Easy Sentences in the Hakka Dialect:\u2014Do., Cantonese made Easy:\u2014Nocentini, Il santo editto di K\u2019a\u00f1-hi, versione Mancese:\u2014Richthofen, F. von, China, vol. iv. Paleont.:\u2014Francken, J. J. C., en Grys, C. F. M. de, Chineesch-Hollandsch Woordenboek van het Emoi Dialect:\u2014Cordier, Consulat de France \u00e0 Hu\u00e9:\u2014Do., Bibliotheca Sinica Tome 2. fasc. 2:\u2014Contenson, Baron de, Chine et L\u2019Extr\u00eame Orient:\u2014M. Jametel has received the Prix Stanislas Julien for his work entitled \u201cL\u2019Eucr\u00e9 dans la Chine;\u201d \u2014and M. Terrien de Lacouperie has been appointed Professor of Indo-Chinese Philology in University College, London.\n\nJapan.\u2014A considerable number of essays, reviews, and books have been issued during the last year on subjects connected with Japan, to some of which we shall briefly refer here. Thus, in the Journ. Roy. Asiat. Soc., XV. 3, Chamberlain, B. H., writes On two questions of Japanese Arch\u00e6ology:\u2014in the Athen\u00e6um (June 2) is an excellent review of the \u201cDiary of Richard Cocks, Cape-Merchant in the English Factory in Japan, A.D. 1615\u201322,\u201d which has been edited for the Hakluyt Society by Mr. E. M. Thompson. We, also, learn (Oct. 20) that many of Mr. Herbert Spencer\u2019s works have been translated into Japanese, and, also, that, in the University of Tokio, they, along with other European works, are studied in the originals. From May 31, we, also, learn that an interesting collection of early printed books from Japan and Corea has been offered for purchase to the Trustees of the British Museum. The earliest specimen is a Buddhist D\u0101r\u0101ni, enclosed in a small wooden model of a\nPagoda, which was printed by order of the Empress Shiyau-toku in the latter half of the eighth century A.D. There are, also, copies of Buddhist works issued during the following centuries, together with native editions of Chinese works, beginning with the \"Confucian Discourses\" (A.D. 1364), the first non-Buddhist work printed in Japan.\n\nIn the Academy (Aug. 18) is a review by Mr. Monkhouse, of Mr. E. G. Holtsman's \"Eight Years in Japan,\" a work, perhaps, not of great literary merit, but, as a description of the people he met with, thoroughly reliable:\u2014and in March 29, 1884, the same reviewer notices, with high praise, the \"Japan\" of Prof. J. J. Rein, the valuable outcome of travels and researches undertaken at the cost of the Prussian Government in the years 1874 and 1875.\n\nIn the Annales de l'Extr\u00eame Orient (August, 1883), M. Meyners D'Estrey writes on Japanese Anthropology:\u2014and in October, December, and February, 1884, M. Pierre Bons D'Anty gives three articles entitled \"Les Divisions Territoriales du Japon, G\u00e9ographiques, Politiques et Administratives,\" which are interesting as giving brief but clear summaries of the matters with which they deal. In February, is a notice of a new Society, called Kana-no-Khwai, the object of which is to eliminate from the Japanese language, as far as possible, the Chinese characters which materially add to the difficulty of its study. The Society proposes in futuro to make use of only the Kana or Indigenous Alphabet, which comprises 48 distinct characters.\n\nIn the Journal of the American Oriental Society, Prof. B. S. Lyman has a paper On the Japanese Nigori of Composition. Among miscellaneous papers may be mentioned Pflizmaier, A., Untersuchungen \u00fcber Ainu-gegenst\u00e4nde (Sitzbericht. Wien. Akad.):\u2014Rosny, L. de, Memorial sur l'Antiquit\u00e9 Japonaise (M\u00e9langes Orient.):\u2014M\u00fcller-Beeck, F. G., Gesch. d. Liukiu Inseln nach Japan (Berl. Ges. f. Anthropol.) :\u2014Brauns, D., Die Ainu der Insel Yezo (ibid.) :\u2014Art Manufactures in\nJapan (Builder, xlv. No. 2111):\u2014and, in the Chrysanthemum, iii. 3, Chamberlain, B. H., Notes on Japanese Philosophy:\u2014Brinkley, F., The Story of the Riukiu (Loochoo) complication, and The House of Karoda:\u2014Dixon, J. M., The Ainu Language:\u2014and Dr. Groth, Higher Education in Japan, transl. from the German by C. S. Ely. Among miscellaneous books, we may mention Cotteau, E., De Paris au Japon en quatre-vingt-dix Jours:\u2014Audsley, G. A., The Ornamental Arts of Japan, part i.:\u2014Crowe, A. H., Highways and Byeways in Japan:\u2014Griffis, W. E., Corea, the Hermit Nation:\u2014Dresser, C., Japan, its Architecture, Art, and Art Manufacture:\u2014and a new Edition of \u201cMurray\u2019s Handbook for Japan,\u201d drawn up by E. M. Satow, Esq., M.R.A.S., now H.M. Agent and Consul-General at Bangkok, and Lieut. A. G. S. Hawes, R.A., and F. A. J. von Langezg, Japanische Thee-geschichten:\u2014Fu-s\u00f4-ch\u00e2-wa,\u2014a series of Miscellaneous Essays. In the \u201cM\u00e9langes Orientaux,\u201d M. L\u00e9on de Roisy gives \u201cKo-z\u00ee-ki, M\u00e9morial de l\u2019Antiquit\u00e9 Japonaise.\u201d\n\nFurther India and Malayo-Polynesia.\u2014To the \u201cAnnales de l\u2019Extr\u00eame Orient,\u201d with its now additional title \u201cet de l\u2019Afrique,\u201d as on former occasions, we are indebted for many notices of the Islands, etc., to the East of India Proper. What, however, we have to record, from this source, is, this year, comparatively little, as, unfortunately, a large part of this once valuable Journal is now given to Politics, not to say Polemics, into which we cannot enter: this new plan mars, too, its value as a record of literary work. Taking, then, as little heed as possible to International Politics, the following articles may be noticed:\u2014Thus, in the July number, agreeably with the new title of this work, we have an account of Madagascar by M. Charles Gr\u00e9mieux, accompanied by an useful and well-executed Map of the Island:\u2014In August, the same writer deals with what he calls \u201cLe Second Canal de Suez.\u201d There is, also, a\nbrief notice of the New Hebrides and of a Birmese Embassy recently arrived in Paris. At the end of it, Dr. Harmand briefly replies to some of the views put forth by Mr. A. H. Keane, in the \"Annales\" for Feb. and March of last year. In September, M. de Fonville has a good paper entitled \"La Justice aux Indes Orientales N\u00e9erlandaises,\" p. 65.\n\nIn October, M. Leon F\u00e9er gives a pleasant r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the Congress of Orientalists at Leyden:\u2014There is, also, a notice of \"Binh-Thuan, nouvelle province Fran\u00e7aise,\" a brief sketch of the \"Marquis Tseng,\" with a notice of two useful books of their class, M. Paul Deschanel's \"La question du Tongkin,\" and of M. Bouinais's \"La Cochin-Chine contemporaine.\"\n\nIn November, is a very interesting Memoir of Dr. A. J. C. Geerts, who has been known for the last 14 years, as one of the most eminent Europeans in Japan\u2014together with a notice of the discovery of the scene of the massacre of the ill-fated La Perouse and of his companions. The December Number, with the exception of a brief article on the Volcanic action of Krakatau, is entirely political. In January 1884, is a further account of the misdeeds of Krakatau and a good notice of M. Gautier's \"Les Fran\u00e7ais au Tonkin 1787-1883.\"\u2014We learn, also, that, apropos of the last Oriental Congress at Leyden, L'Institut Royal des Indes N\u00e9erlandaises has published four volumes of importance for the history of the Extreme East, 1. Essais de po\u00e9sie Boughis et Macassar, par la Dr. B. T. Matthes; 2. Histoire de Nanette, texte Boughis, etc., par G. K. Niemann; and two vols. of the Memoires de l'Institut.\u2014The February Number contains nothing of any interest. That of March contains a good article by M. Dubard entitled, \"La Legislation Cambodgienne,\"\u2014and one by M. L\u00e9on Feer (all that this scholar writes is worthy of attention) on \"Les Trente-deux R\u00e9cits du Trone, ou les merveilleux exploits de Vikramaditya, traduits du Bengali.\"\u2014In the number for April, M. Valabrigue gives a paper, \"Sur la litt\u00e9rature\nAnnamite,\u201d and there is, also, a brief notice of the Oasis of Merv.\n\nOf the excellent collection published by the French Government at Sa\u00efgon, under the title \u201cCochiu-chine Fran\u00e7aise, Excursions et Reconnaissances,\u201d several numbers have appeared, the most important of which is an able \u201cEtude sur la Litterature Annamite,\u201d by Mr. L. Villard, who gives long quotations translated from the original texts (No. xii. pp. 446\u2013491). In the \u201cM\u00e9langes Orientaux,\u201d M. des Michels prints Kem V\u00e2n Ki\u00ean Truy\u00e8n, po\u00e8me Annamite, avec traduction.\n\n**Egyptology.**\u2014The work of the last year and the discoveries made in it have so far surpassed that of any similar period of the same length, that it is impossible within our limits to do more than allude to many matters, each of which really deserves a careful study and a full record. As on former occasions, we can only note the more important papers that have been issued during the last year, with a list of books, etc. Thus, in the Proceedings of the Biblical Archaeological Society, May 1, 1883, is a letter from Mr. Le Page Renouf \u201cOn mythological figures on an Egyptian papyrus:\u201d\u2014June 5, a letter from Prof. Pleyte \u201cOn Mr. Revillout\u2019s notice of The Papyrus-Dodgson:\u201d\u2014and in the same number, a communication from Mr. Cope Whitehouse \u201cOn his Researches in the Moeris Basin\u201d and what, he (probably) alone, thinks, these demonstrate:\u2014In Dec. 4, Jan. 8, Feb. 5, March 4 and April 1, are a series of papers \u201cOn Hypocephali by Dr. Birch and Mr. De Horrack. The plates of the objects, which are perfect as specimens of art, have been drawn on stone by the Sec. B.A.S., Mr. W. H. Rylands, M.R.A.S., F.S.A.:\u2014Mr. Le Page Renouf contributes two papers, the first \u201cOn two Egyptian prepositions,\u201d Feb. 5; the second, \u201cOn the bow in the Egyptian Sky,\u201d March 4. In the Transactions of the Society, vol. viii. pt. 1, M. Revillout prints, \u201cLes\nAnath\u00e8mes d'une M\u00e8re Payenne contre son fils devenu Chr\u00e9tienne,\" and \"Pi\u00e8ces relatives \u00e0 une mariage du temps de Darius:\"\u2014in Part 2, Dr. Birch has a paper \"On a Tablet in the British Museum relating to two Architects,\" and Mr. Le Page Renouf, one, \"On Egyptian Mythology, particularly with reference to Mist and Cloud.\" Again, from the Atheneum, June 30, we learn that H.H. the Prince Ibrahim Hilmy, the brother of the Khedive, is preparing a bibliography of Printed Books, MSS., etc., relating to the Political and Social life of Egypt from the earliest to the present times:\u2014In the same number, in July 21, and in Aug. 18, Signor Lanciani gives the wonderful tale of the recent discoveries in Rome on the site of the Iseum:\u2014In July 7, is a good review of Dr. Birch's very complete catalogue of \"The Collection of Egyptian Antiquities at Alnwick Castle\"; and we also learn that he is far advanced with his \"Hieroglyphic Dictionary.\"\n\nIn March 1 is a review of Mr. W. M. Flinders Petrie's \"The Pyramids and Temples of Ghizeh,\" which is interesting as all works on such a subject must be, which are original. Mr. Petrie's measurements are, probably, superior to those of any of his predecessors; we are, therefore, glad to learn that the Royal Society has granted to him \u00a3100, in aid of further researches.\n\nIn March 22 is a notice of the Report of \"The Commission for the Preservation of the Monuments of Cairo,\" for whom our Member, E. T. Rogers Bey, has worked so zealously\u2014the object of the Commission being simply to see to necessary repairs, not, as has been ruinously done in India, to restore or rebuild.\n\nIn April 26 is a brief notice of Mr. J. Loftie's \"Essay on Scarabs,\"\u2014a useful manual for collectors, who, we hear, are more likely to secure the objects themselves than the book intended for their description, as the number of copies issued has been strangely limited.\nIn the *Academy* we find, as usual, a prominent attention paid to Egyptian matters, the invaluable correspondent of this Journal, Miss Edwards, having given to it quite as many and quite as interesting communications as last year. We will take these in their regular order. Thus, in June 23, Miss Edwards gives a useful review (in that she points out what \"The Book of the Dead\" really is) of Prof. W. Pleyte's \"Chapitres suppl\u00e9mentaires du Livre des Morts\":\u2014In July 21, she calls attention to some important metrical results with reference to the Ancient Empire and the Measurements of the Great Pyramid, recently arrived at by M. Gr\u00e9baut, adding that M. Maspero has just found a new copy of the so-called \"Decree of Canopus,\" and, also, the Sarcophagus of Psammetichus II.:\u2014In Nov. 10 she reviews Mr. W. M. Flinders Petrie's \"Pyramids and Temples of Ghizeh,\" and shows its real value as sweeping away once and for all the notions about a \"sacred cubit,\" a \"Pyramid inch,\" and any number of other affected \"symbolisms\":\u2014In Dec. 8 she gives, under the title \"Egyptian Jottings,\" much information as to the doings of MM. Maspero and Pleyte, and a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the last fasciculus of \"Etudes Egyptiennes\":\u2014in Jan. 10, 1884, she contributes a very clear notice of M. Maspero's \"Guide du Visiteur au Mus\u00e9e de Boulaq;\"\u2014and in Feb. 16, a pleasant sketch of four American books or papers referring to Egypt:\u2014in Feb. 23 she points out how much destruction is still being done to Egyptian Monuments, etc., chiefly by the ignorance of the petty local officials, limestone for building purposes and for the kiln being ruthlessly taken from any ruins within reach of river-transport: in March 22 she reviews Mr. Loftie's \"Essay on Scarabs.\"\n\nIn April 26, Miss Edwards records M. Maspero's discovery of an \"entire necropolis, the mere existence of which has remained unsuspected by tomb-breakers and depredators ancient and modern.\" The Necropolis thus discovered seems\nto belong to the Greek period, but was, almost certainly, constructed upon earlier entombments.\u2014As an idea of the value of the \"find,\" it is enough to state that five vaults only contained as many as 120 mummies, and that these were all uninjured. M. Maspero has also found, quite perfect, the tomb of Pepi I. (6th Dyn.) :\u2014In May 3, Miss Edwards gives a further report of Mr. Flinders Petrie's last achievement, \"The discovery of the Necropolis of Tanis,\" but the details far exceed our space, though exceedingly worthy of careful study. Lastly, Miss Edwards writes, May 31, on what she well calls \"A Colossus of Colossi,\" being Mr. Petrie's account of the fragments he has found of a granite Colossus of Rameses II., which had been cut up for building purposes by one of the rulers of the 26th Dynasty. The fragments he has found show that the original statue must have been nearly one hundred feet high, as tall, indeed, as the Colossi at Bamian. \"The great toe, alone,\" he says, \"measures eighteen inches across.\" He adds that only \"small pieces of a few tons each are now to be seen.\"\n\nWe learn further (June 16) that the Louvre has recently acquired from the Posno Collection a bronze statuette of great beauty and early date:\u2014and in July 7 and August 18, M. Barnabei gives notices of the recent discoveries in Rome of Egyptian antiquities, which should be read along with those of M. Lanciani, already referred to.\n\nIn Sept. 15, is a notice of Prof. Merriam's paper \"On the Greek and Latin Inscriptions,\" on the bronze Crab of the Obelisk recently removed to New York; and, in Oct. 6, is a letter from M. Naville, M.R.A.S., controverting, but in his own kind manner, some previous views of the veteran Lepsius, \"On Pithom and Ramses.\" We have much pleasure in adding that the \"Hawk and the Statue of the Recorder of Pithom,\" found by M. Naville, are now (as the gift of Sir Erasmus Wilson and of the Egyptian Exploration Fund) in the British\nMuseum. In Jan. 19, Prof. Sayce writes from Abydos, announcing the discovery of a tomb of the XIIIth Dynasty, near Si\u00fbt, and stating that the tombs in the cliff behind the Citadel of Cairo are not older than the time of Augustus.\u2014In Feb. 2, is a further letter from Prof. Sayce, dated Luxor, Jan. 7, which has only to be read, to be appreciated. To March 15, Mr. R. S. Poole contributes Mr. Flinders Petrie\u2019s own description of his remarkable discoveries in \u201cThe Great Temple of San,\u201d of the highest interest as showing how much, after more than 2000 years of wilful destruction, there still remains, in Egypt, to reward the honest explorer; see, also, in April 5, a capital letter from M. Naville on the same subject.\u2014In the same Number, is an energetic letter from M. Renan urging support to M. Maspero in his great labours in Egyptian excavation. M. Renan\u2019s letter commences with the words, \u201cLa conservation des monuments de l\u2019Egypte importe \u00e0 l\u2019humanit\u00e9 tout enti\u00e8re\u201d\u2014and, concludes, no less characteristically, \u201cAjoutons que l\u2019honneur de la France s\u2019y trouve engag\u00e9e.\u201d\u2014Lastly, in July 21, Mr. R. S. Poole demolishes Mr. Cope Whitehouse, and his vagaries about Lake Moeris; and, in Sept. 22, satisfactorily answers Prof. Lepsius\u2019s contention that M. Naville has not found \u201cthe Pithom of the Bible,\u201d though what the latter scholar has advanced \u201crests on the unimpeachable testimony of monuments dug up on the spot.\u201d\u2014In a still later paper (May 24, 1884) Mr. Poole conveys to us the welcome news that Dr. Brugsch fully and unreservedly accepts M. Naville\u2019s discovery.\n\nIn the Z.D.M.G. is a paper by Dr. A. Erman, entitled Eine Aegyptisch Statuette (37. 3).\n\nIn the Journal Asiatique M. Maspero (Oct.-Nov.-Dec. p. 533) gives an account of an Egyptian inscription of 6000 lines, recently discovered by him.\n\nFrom the Rev. Crit. we learn that, in M. Royet\u2019s Monuments de l\u2019Art Antique, livra. 3, 4, there are many beautiful\nspecimens of Egyptian art, with descriptions by M. Maspero. In Jan. 7, 1884, is a notice of M. Maspero\u2019s \u201cConference sur la vie populaire \u00e0 Thebes sous les Rois de la XIXe Dynastie\u201d:\u2014in April 7, is the substance of M. Renan\u2019s appeal in favour of the preservation of Egyptian monuments. Lastly, in May 5, we have a notice of M. Maspero\u2019s forthcoming Guide to the Museum at Boulaq.\n\nThe Revue Egyptologique continues to publish many valuable and well-illustrated papers. Thus, IIIe Ann. No. 1, contains papers by M. Revillout and the late M. Chabas, with a notice of the recent additions to the Egyptian Museum in the Louvre: \u2014 Sybil, L. v., also, writes, Kritik d. Aegypt. Ornements. IIIe Ann. No. 2, has a second letter from M. Revillout to M. Lenormant, \u201cSur les Monnaies Egyptiennes,\u201d and a paper by MM. Revillout et Krall, \u201cLa vie d\u2019artiste ou de Boh\u00e8me en Egypte, fragment d\u2019un po\u00e8me Satyrique.\u201d Three parts have been issued of the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Aegyptische Sprache u. Alterthumskunde, containing papers by MM. Lepsius, Erman, Stern, Naville, Dumichen, Lef\u00e8bure, Maspero, Wiedemann, and others.\n\nOf miscellaneous books, the following may be noted: Lagarde, P. de, Aegyptiaca:\u2014Prato, La leggenda del Tesoro di Ramsinite:\u2014Lemm, Aegyptische Lesest\u00fccke:\u2014Linke, A. A., Skizze d. Aelt-Aegypt. Lit.:\u2014Wiedemann, A., Aelt-Aegyptische w\u00f6rte von Klass. Autoren:\u2014and, by the same, Aelt-Aegypt. Gesch. 1. Abth.:\u2014Landmehr, Papyrus Berolinensis:\u2014Maspero, Mastabas de l\u2019Ancien Empire, vol. 4:\u2014Guide du visiteur du Mus\u00e9e de Boulaq:\u2014and, Etudes Egyptiennes, fasc. 3:\u2014Brugsch, Thesaurus Inscr. Egypt. Abtheil. 3:\u2014Loftie, Essay on Scarabs:\u2014Dr. Birch, Cat. of Egyptian Antiquities at Alnwick:\u2014Lenormant, F., Civilisation, M\u0153urs et Mons. de l\u2019Egypte (vol. 3 of Histoire Ancienne):\u2014Schiaparelli, Monumenti Egiziani rinvenuti di recente in Roma.\n\nEpigraphy.\u2014The most important work of the last year has\nbeen the publication of the second part of the great French \"Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum,\" which was, as we ventured to anticipate (Report 1883, p. cxvii), presented to the Oriental Congress at Leyden on Sept. 10. It is needless to discuss its merits here: suffice it, that the grand work done by the French scholars in 1882 has been thoroughly well sustained, in their last publication, tomus i. fasc. 2. This fasciculus is illustrated by a volume of plates, xv\u2014xxxvi, quite equal to those issued with the first part. We trust that a work, so justly appreciated by all true scholars, may be successfully carried out with as little delay as possible.\n\nIn the Indian Antiquary, Mr. Fleet has continued his valuable researches, and has published Sanskrit and Old Canarese Inscriptions, Nos. 127\u2013145:\u2014to Professor B\u00fchler we, also, owe a notice of the Dhiniki Grant of King J\u0101ikadeva (June); of the Rathor Grants No. 3 (July); of that of Dharanivah\u0101ra of Vadhvan (ibid); and of the Illichpur Grant of Pravaras\u00e9na II. of Vakataka (Sept.). In July is a paper by H. H. Dhruva, on a copper-plate grant of King Trilochanapala Chalukya of Latudesa, dated Saka 972, A.D. 1050. In the same number Dr. A. F. H. Hoernle replies, and most courteously, to the views promulgated by Prof. Bhandarkar with reference to the Gatha Dialects, and Mr. Rehatsek writes on an epitaph from Aden. In August Mr. Fleet deals with Rajapitamah\u00e1, the Silahara title:\u2014and, in October, is a continuation of M. S\u00e9nart\u2019s papers under the title of the \"Column Inscription of Piyadasi.\" From Dr. Hultzsch, we have a notice of \"A grant of Krishna II. of Ankulesvar, dated A.D. 888: of Karnata Grants No. 1: A grant of Venkata II., A.D. 1636: A note on a Bhauma-Yantra: and, Karnata Grants, No. 2, a grant of Ranga II., dated A.D. 1644\u20135.\n\nIn January, 1884, the Rev. T. Foulkes gives an account of the \"Grant of the Bana King Vikramaditya II.\":\u2014in February, S. M. Nat\u00e9sa Sastri Pandit, describes \"Two\nEastern Chalukya Copper Plates\":\u2014and the Editor, Dr. Burgess, \"Two Tamil Copper Plate Grants.\"\n\nIn March, Dr. Bhagvanlal Indraji, Hon. M.R.A.S., gives a notice of a \"New Gurjara Copper Plate Grant: and Mr. K. B. Pathik of \"An Old Canarese Inscription of Hadali.\" In April, Mr. K. T. Telang writes on \"The date of Sankar\u00e2-ch\u00e2rya.\" In May, Prof. Kielhorn describes \"Three Inscriptions from Kanheri.\n\nIn the Proceedings of Biblical Archaeological Society is a paper by M. Alex. Ermann \"On the origin of the Cypriote Syllabary\" (May, 1883):\u2014and, in June, one by Mr. W. H. Rylands, M.R.A.S., \"On the Aleppo Inscription,\" with an excellently executed folding plate:\u2014in the same number, is, also, a paper by Mr. E. A. Budge, M.R.A.S., \"On some Himyaritic Inscriptions presented to the British Museum by Major W. Hunter.\" In Nov. Dr. W. Wright, of Cambridge, gives an account of a Samaritan Inscription, now in the Museum of the Leeds Philosophical Society; and of some inscribed stones from Palmyra. Mr. Rylands, also, notices a Cylinder belonging to the Rev. H. E. Reichardt, bearing a brief Ph\u0153nician Inscription, the purport of which is doubtful.\u2014In March 4, is a letter from M. Berger \"On the Ph\u0153nician Inscriptions in the British Museum\": M. Ganneau gives a paper \"On a Hebrew Inscription from the Necropolis at Joppa,\" and Mr. Rylands a drawing of a Hittite Inscription formerly at Aleppo. In the Z.D.M.G., 37. 2, Dr. B\u00fchlert writes \"Beitr\u00e4ge zur erkl\u00e4rung d. Asoka Inschriften\":\u2014with a further paper on the same subject in pt. 3; and, in the same part, M. von Stickel has a paper \"Zur Orientalischen Sphragistik.\"\u2014In part 2, also, D. H. M\u00fcller deals with Sab\u00e6an Inscriptions collected by Siegfried Langer, who was murdered in 1882.\u2014In pt. 4, M. Euting has a paper entitled \"Epigraphisches,\" with three plates of Ph\u0153nician Inscriptions: Hultzsch deals with Inscriptions from Amravati, and B\u00fchlert continues his article above noticed.\nIn the *Journal Asiatique*, Febr.-Mars, M. Ganneau writes on Sceaux et Cachets, Isra\u00e9lites, Ph\u00e9niciens et Syriens:\u2014M. Barth on an \u201cInscription Sanscrite de Han Chey\u201d:\u2014M. S\u00e9nart continues his Inscriptions de Piyadasi [ch. 3me] Dhiali et Jaugada:\u2014De Vog\u00fc\u00e9 writes on \u201cInscriptions Palmyreniennes in\u00e9dites\u201d discovered recently by Prince Lazarew:\u2014and M. Renan, \u201cSur deux Monuments Epigraphiques d\u2019Edesse.\u201d\u2014In April-Mai-Juin, M. Aymonier gives \u201cQuelques Notions sur les Inscriptions en vieux Khmer\u201d: and, p. 524, Ganneau puts forth the suggestion that the Inscription of Esmunazar is later than Alexander.\n\nIn Ao\u00fbt-Sept., De Vog\u00fc\u00e9 and Aymonier continue their papers; and MM. J. and H. Derenbourg print \u00c9tudes sur l\u2019Epigraphie du Y\u00e9men: In Oct.-Nov.-Dec., M. Rubens Duval comments on M. de Vog\u00fc\u00e9\u2019s Palmyrene inscriptions, and M. de Vog\u00fc\u00e9 gives a note in reply.\u2014In January, 1884, M. Hal\u00e9vy criticizes severely the \u201cInscriptions Sab\u00e9ennes\u201d of MM. J. and H. Derenbourg.\n\nIn the *Proceedings of the Bengal Asiatic Society*, Feb. 1883, Mr. E. V. Westmacott, M.R.A.S., contributes a rubbing of a Kutila Inscription of Mahi P\u00e1l Deb from Monghyr, Messrs. Rajendra Mitra and G. A. Grierson adding some remarks:\u2014and in March, Rajendra Mitra notices \u201cA Sanskrit inscription from Deogh\u00e1r (see also, Journal, lii. 1. 2, p. 186, etc.).\n\nIn the *Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society*, vol. xvi. No. 42, Pandit Bhagvanlal Indraji, writes \u201cOn a New Copper-Plate Grant of the Chalukya Dynasty found at Navs\u00e2ri\u201d:\u2014with two papers, \u201cOn New Copper-Plate Grants of the Rashtrak\u00fbta Dynasty,\u201d Parts 1, 2:\u2014Mr. J. B. Fleet, M.R.A.S., publishes \u201cA Godavari Copper-Plate Grant of the Raja Prithivimula\u201d:\u2014and Surgeon-Major O. Codrington, M.R.A.S., contributes a very valuable paper \u201cOn the seals of the Sat\u00e2ra Kingdom.\u201d\n\nAt the Meeting of the *Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions*, May,\nM. Renan presented a Carthaginian Inscription (tarif des Sacrifices), found by M. Delattre (see ant\u00e8, Berger. Proc. Bibl. Arch. Soc., March 4);\u2014Aug. 24, M. Ledrain notices a Ph\u0153nician Inscription in the Louvre;\u2014and, in Aug. 31, Ganneau speaks of some Ph\u0153nician Monuments in the British Museum:\u2014in Sept. 14, M. Ledrain deals with \u201cAn Aramaean Inscription\u201d:\u2014In Feb. 8, 1884, M. Berger reads a \u201cNote sur quelques St\u00e8les Ph\u00e9niciennes trouv\u00e9es \u00e0 Hadrumet,\u201d with a further notice on Feb. 22:\u2014In March 14, is an important reading by M. S\u00e9nart of the oldest Religious Edict of Asoka, first published in 1877: M. S\u00e9nart agrees with MM. B\u00fchler and Oldenberg:\u2014On April 9, M. Renan gives Punic Inscriptions on amphori discovered by M. Delattre. In the Journal des Savants, July, the late M. F. Lenormant writes \u201cLes Inscriptions Hittites,\u201d being a review of an article by Prof. Sayce in \u201cFraser,\u201d Aug. 1880, and in vol. vii. of the Trans. Bibl. Arch\u00e6ol. Soc. This must have been one of the latest papers he completed.\n\nThe most important separate book published during last year (after the French \u2018Corpus,\u2019 already alluded to) is Mr. Euting\u2019s Sammlung d. Karthagischen Inschriften, at present plates only:\u2014M. de Vog\u00fc\u00e9 has also published his \u201cInscriptions Palmyreniennes in\u00e9dites,\u201d and M. Amador de los Rios, Memoria acerca de algunas inscriptiones Arabigas de Espa\u00f1a y Portugal:\u2014E. T. Rogers Bey has, also, printed a brief \u201cM\u00e9moire sur certaines Inscriptions en caract\u00e8res Coufiques carr\u00e9s. In the last list of presents we acknowledged the receipt of Mr. Isaac Taylor\u2019s \u201cThe Alphabet,\u201d which is a mine of general information of what other scholars have done before him, with many clever and acute suggestions, the result of his own extensive reading and research. The long discussion on this intricate subject at the Leyden Congress shows, however, that scholars have not as yet made up their minds about the origin of the Alphabet, used in the general sense of this word. In the Athen\u00e6um of July, 1883, is a\nlong and able review of Dr. E. M\u00fcller's Ancient Inscriptions in Ceylon; and, from the same Journal, we hear that there is now good hope that the Acad. d. Inscriptions will be able to publish the collection of Arabic Inscriptions collected, during several years, with such zeal by Mr. Doughty.\n\nNumismatics.\u2014The record, this year, for Numismatics, is not so full as on former occasions; but we may note, in the Academy, Aug. 11, an important paper by E. T. Rogers Bey, entitled \"A new Revelation on Early Kufic Coins,\" the point being that the French collection has been recently enriched, from that formerly in the possession of Soubhi Pasha, by several dirhams, one earlier by 37 years than any one previously known. In Jan. 5, Mr. S. L. Poole, M.R.A.S., gives a full and careful review of M. Sauvaire's \"Mat\u00e9riaux pour servir \u00e0 l'histoire de la Numismatique et de la M\u00e9trologie Musulmanes,\" a collected volume of papers originally published in the Journal Asiatique. At a meeting of the American Oriental Society, a letter was read from W. W. Rockhill, M.R.A.S., inclosing a rubbing of a coin with a Neu-chih Inscription from China, the legend of which has not yet been deciphered.\n\nIn the Numismatic Chronicle, 3rd series, vol. 3, 1883, has been published a \"Catalogue of the Collection of Muhammadan Coins, Pt. 1, The Coins of the Eastern Khalifehs,\" from the collection of E. T. Rogers Bey, M.R.A.S.:\u2014Prof. Terrien de Lacouperie has contributed a valuable paper on \"The Old Numerals, the Counting-Rods, and the Swan-pan in China:\"\u2014and, in Pt. 1, for 1884, Mr. S. L. Poole has written a paper entitled, \"The Arabian historians of Mohammedan Numismatics,\" which is, in fact, the substance of M. Sauvaire's work, \"Mat\u00e9riaux pour servir \u00e0 l'histoire de la Numismatique et de la M\u00e9trologie Musulmanes.\"\n\nIn the Journ. of the Bengal Asiatic Society (lii. pt. 1,\nNo. 2) Mr. C. J. Rodgers gives a paper on \"The Rupees of the Months of the Il\u00e1h\u00ed years of Akbar,\" and, in lii. pt. 1, No. 3, Dr. A. F. Hoernle describes \"A New Find of Muhammadan Coins in Bengal.\" In the Proceedings of the same Society (March) Dr. Hoernle describes some rupees of Shame-ud-din Ily\u00e1s, and of Sikandar Sh\u00e1h ben Ily\u00e1s, and a coin of Sikandar Sh\u00e1h from a hitherto unknown Mint, Chawalstan in Assam:\u2014in April, Mr. Gibbs exhibited and read a note on some gold Ramtinkis:\u2014in May and June Dr. Hoernle exhibited and described a collection of Durr\u00e1n\u00ed coins sent by Mr. Longworth Dames, M.R.A.S. from Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1il Khan, with two letters from Mr. Dames: and Mr. C. J. Rodgers published (with an engraving) a Nis\u00e1r of Shah Jahan in the Museum at Dehli. In July, August and November are notices of coins recently acquired under the provisions of the Treasure Trove Act. Dr. Hoernle, also, exhibited an interesting gold coin found in the ruins of Gaur, and believed to be one of Sh\u00edr Sh\u00e1h, and, also, two gold coins procured by Mr. Rivett Carnac, one of which, of the Gupta series, has been presented by him to the British Museum. Dr. Hoernle, also, described a new find of Muhammadan Coins of Bengal, including hitherto unknown ones of Mahmud Shah I. and of Barbuk Sh\u00e1h. In December is a full abstract of the important and long-expected paper by Mr. Vincent A. Smith, M.R.A.S., entitled \"A classified and detailed Catalogue of the Gold Coins of the Imperial Gupta Dynasty of Northern India,\" which will shortly appear in full in the Journal:\u2014lastly, in January, 1884, Mr. C. T. Rodgers contributes a paper \"On some Coins of Ranjit Deo, King of Jumm\u00e1, a hundred years ago.\"\n\nIn the Journal of the Bombay Asiatic Society, vol. xvi. No. 42, are papers by Lieut.-Col. Prideaux, on the Coins of the Benu Rasool Dynasty of South Arabia:\u2014Part 4 of Mr. Gerson da Cunha's Contributions to the Study of Portuguese Numismatics:\u2014On some rare Coins of the\nAmawee Khaleefehs, by Surgeon-Major O. Codrington, M.D., M.R.A.S.:\u2014On the Coinage of El Harar in East Africa, by Lieut.-Col. Prideaux, and \u201cOn Copper Coins of the Bahmani Dynasty,\u201d by Surgeon-Major O. Codrington, M.D., M.R.A.S.\n\nOf books, the only one we have this year to notice as of importance is that by Mr. S. L. Poole, 8th vol. of the \u201cCatalogue of Oriental Coins in the British Museum,\u201d containing chiefly a description of the Coins of the Ottoman Turks, with a notice of the Crimean war medals, and a table drawn up by E. J. W. Gibbs, M.R.A.S., showing the growth and chief divisions of the Ottoman Empire. The Cat. d. Num. Afdeeling van het Museum Batav. Genootschap tweede druk (published, it would seem, in 1877, but only just to hand) is interesting for its coins of the Extreme East.\n\nThe Trustees of the British Museum have bought the collection of Chinese Coins made by C. T. Gardner, Esq., M.R.A.S., H.M. Consul, Ichang.\n\nMr. Barclay V. Head, M.R.A.S., has received the Prix-Hauteroche this year.\n\nAfrica.\u2014There is comparatively little to record under this head on this occasion, but M. Berthoud has given in the Journal of this Society, Vol. XVI. Pt. 1, a \u201cGrammatical Note on the Gwamba Language of South Africa.\u201d In the Journal Asiatique, Avril-Mai-Juin, M. Basset gives \u201cNotes sur Lexicographie Berb\u00e8re.\u201d Some useful books have been published; of these, the most valuable is Mr. R. N. Cust\u2019s Sketch of the Modern Languages of Africa, a comprehensive account of the 591 Languages and Dialects of the whole continent of Africa, with a language-map and thirty-one autotype portraits. We have, also, by J. Payne, A Grebo Grammar, one of the dialects spoken by the Agau in Abyssinia:\u2014M. Schuchardt has published a Grammatical Note of the Negro-Portuguese patois of the Island of St. Thomas; and, also,\nof that of Benguela. The Soc. Prom. Christ. Knowledge has printed a third edition of Bp. Steere's Suahili Hand-book.\n\nSelections from the Report of the British and Foreign Bible Society. Progress in the work of Translation and Revision (1883-1884).\u2014Amoy Colloquial (in Roman Character).\u2014The Old Testament is now completed, the version having been made by the Amoy Missionaries, from the Delegates' version, for Amoy and Formosa.\n\nAmharic.\u2014The Bible, as revised by the late Dr. Krapf, has been corrected chiefly for printer's mistakes, etc. The book will be reprinted in paragraph form.\n\nArabic.\u2014The Rev. Dr. Van Dyck, the translator of the Arabic Bible, is now carefully reading the vowelled and un-vowelled editions of this Bible.\n\nArarat-Armenian.\u2014Mr. Amirkhanianz is engaged at Tiflis in preparing many references and chapter-headings for the Bible, by the aid of Dr. Scrivener's Edition of the Authorized Version.\n\nBengali.\u2014A Representative Committee has translated the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Mark.\n\nBaluchi.\u2014The Rev. A. Lewis has translated the Gospel of St. Matthew.\n\nChamba.\u2014The Gospel of St. Matthew has been published in the Hill dialect of Chamba, and a considerable portion of the Gospel of St. John has been translated. The character used is called Thakari, and is a modification of the Devanagari, the dialect being distinctly Sanskritic. The translation was made by Sohan Lal, pastor of the native church, and himself a native of Chamba, from the Hindi text, compared with the Panjabi and English. The translation will probably be useful as far westward as Jammu, and also throughout a large portion of the valley of the Chenab in the hills.\n\nCanton-Colloquial.\u2014The Committee have authorized the printing of a new edition of the Psalms by Dr. Graves.\nCorean.\u2014Mr. Ross has progressed steadily during the year in the work of translation, revision, and publication, and several of the earlier translations have been re-translated and revised.\n\nDahome.\u2014The Rev. T. J. Marshall, of Porto Novo, has completed his version of the Gospel of St. Matthew. There are several Popa dialects between the Volta and Lagos, but it is believed that with the Ewe for the Westerly part and Mr. Marshall\u2019s Dahome version for the Eastern, we shall have all we really need.\n\nEwe.\u2014The Rev. T. J. Marshall, of Porto Novo, hopes to complete the revision of St. Matthew very soon.\n\nFanti.\u2014The New Testament has been translated as far as the Epistle of St. John by Mr. Parker. The translation has been chiefly made from the Authorized English Version, compared with the Otji version.\n\nFijian.\u2014The Bible has been completed.\n\nGreco-Turkish.\u2014The Revision of the Turkish Bible in Greek characters, which was begun in 1881, has been completed.\n\nGujarati.\u2014A Committee has been engaged during the year in the revision of the New Testament, preparatory to printing a new edition.\n\nHebrew.\u2014Dr. Delitzsch continues unremittingly the improvement of his version of the New Testament.

Jaulz, of Japara, has translated the Gospel of St. Luke, and begun that of St. Matthew.\n\nJaghatai Turkish.\u2014The Rev. James Bassett, of Tehran, has revised his Gospel of St. Matthew for the Committee, and a new edition is being carried through the press by Mr. Amirkhanianz of Tiflis.\n\nJapanese.\u2014The translation of the Old Testament has made steady progress throughout the year. Since the last report\nI. Kings and II. Samuel have been translated, by the Rev. P. K. Fyson, C.M.S., and printed and circulated. Dr. Hepburn has translated the Book of Jeremiah, and this has also been published.\n\n*Kabyle.*\u2014With a view to securing as accurate a version as possible, Dr. Sauerwein was sent out to Algiers by the Committee. He has returned with a version of the Gospel of St. John, made from the French by an Arab who assisted P\u00e8re Olivier with his Kabyle-French Dictionary. Dr. Sauerwein is now revising the Gospel from the Greek, and this will shortly be sent to press.\n\n*Kaffir.*\u2014The Revisers began work April 3rd, 1869, and completed the New Testament March 4th, 1874. The revised New Testament has been printed. From July 8th, 1874, to Jan. 22nd, 1882, the Old Testament was revised up to Jeremiah xxvi., and Genesis and the Psalms have been published tentatively.\n\n*Khasi.*\u2014The printing of the Pentateuch has gone on under the care of the Rev. William Lewis of Wrexham. The revised MS. for which the printing of the Pocket New Testament was suspended, is now completed.\n\n*Kazan Tartar.*\u2014The Gospel of St. Matthew, translated by M. Saleman, has been published.\n\n*Kalmuck.*\u2014The Committee have authorized the publication of an edition of 2000 copies of the New Testament, prepared by Prof. Pozdnajeff, and new type has been cut at the expense of the Society.

Jukes, of Dera Ghazi Khan, Col. Millett, of the Punjab Police Force, and the Rev. T. Bomford, C.M.S., are engaged in translating the New\nTestament into Multani or Derw\u00e2l, which is spoken by 1,600,000 at least.\n\nPersian.\u2014The Committee have agreed to print an edition of 2000 copies of the Gospel of St. Mark, slightly revised by Dr. Bruce. Dr. Bruce has also revised the Books of Genesis and Exodus, and part of the Book of Psalms.\n\nRarotongan.\u2014The Rev. W. Wyatt-Gill, who has had forty years experience among the islands of the Pacific, is now engaged on a thorough revision of the Rarotonga Bible.\n\nSwahili.\u2014Archdeacon Hodgson, of the Universities' Mission, has carried through the press the Book of Genesis. The translation was the work of the late Bishop Steere, and a portion has been printed tentatively at Zanzibar. The Book of Joshua is about to be published from a version made by Archdeacon Hodgson with the aid of a native of Zanzibar, once a slave, now a student at St. Augustine's College, Canterbury. This version will be the first translation of the Book of Joshua in any East African language.\n\nTelugu.\u2014The Book of Exodus has been revised the second time, and Leviticus and Numbers prepared for the press. Drs. Hay and Chamberlain have been appointed to bring Genesis in style and phraseology into harmony with the style adopted in the rest of the Pentateuch. Genesis is printed, and a portion of Deuteronomy. Dr. Hay also has made a thorough revision of his new translation of the Book of Proverbs, which has been published, and is well received both by Hindus and Christians. A tentative edition of the Revised New Testament has been issued in brevier type.\n\nTibetan.\u2014The Rev. H. A. Jaeschke, the greatest of Tibetan scholars, died last year while passing the revision of his version, by Messrs. Hyde and Redalob, through the press. The Committee have consented to the proofs being read by the Rev. Mr. Reichelt, who worked many\nyears on Jaeschke's Dictionary, and by the Rev. Dr. S. C. Malan.\n\nTrans-Caucasian-Turkish (Azerbaijan).\u2014Mr. Amirkhanianz has completed the translation of the Bible.\n\nTurkish.\u2014The Rev. R. H. Wankley and Drs. Rigg and Herrick have continued their revision of the Bible throughout the year.\n\nYoruba.\u2014The printing of the Bible, which was being carried through the press by the Rev. D. Hindever for this Society, has now been completed.\n\nEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica [Ninth Edition].\u2014In this publication, vol. xv., are the following Essays bearing on the history, etc., of Asia and of the East, viz.

As, however, no official account has as yet been published of the work of the various sections, a detailed account of it must be reserved for the Report of next year.\nA portion of the Annual Report of the Council having been read, the following gentlemen were duly elected as the Council and officers of the ensuing year.\n\nPresident.\u2014Sir William Muir, K.C.S.I., D.C.L., LL.D.\n\nDirector.\u2014Major-General Sir Henry C.

F. W. Holt, Esq.\n\nHonorary Secretary.\u2014Robert N. Cust, Esq.\n\nThe Chairman (Major-General Sir H. C. Rawlinson, K.C.B., Director) then said:\u2014Ladies and Gentlemen,\u2014As you are all well aware, I am not filling this chair to-day as your President. I have merely, for the last four months, been acting as President in place of Sir Bartle Frere, our late President, who has been incapacitated, through illness, from continuing his duty in this respect to this Society. I need not dilate on Sir Bartle Frere's abilities or qualifications for the post of President. You all know him too well to render any eulogy of him on my part necessary. But he finds himself in such a state of health at present that he is neither able to perform the duty of President nor does\nhe entertain the hope of being able to do so in the future. Under these circumstances, the Council have considered the qualifications of one of the greatest Orientalists in this country or in Europe, and they have come to the conclusion that no one could better fulfil the duties of President, or do more honour to this Society, than Sir William Muir. His reputation is known, not only throughout this kingdom, but throughout Europe and Asia. I feel satisfied that he will meet all your expectations, and that he will carry on the affairs of this Society in the same efficient manner as they have been for many years past. I have great pleasure in handing over to him\u2014vicariously, I should add\u2014a most efficient Council and Secretary. Nothing could exceed the efficiency of either. As for our Secretary, he has performed his duties with assiduity and ability. I may say, indeed, that by his energy he has raised the Society to our present flourishing condition, with a Journal too, for the last four years, issued quarterly. I have no doubt that Mr. Vaux will continue his labours under Sir William Muir in the same manner as heretofore. Without, therefore, trespassing any further on your time, I will now call upon our new President to take the chair. (Sir Henry Rawlinson then vacated the chair, which was taken by the President, Sir William Muir.)\n\nThe President, in returning thanks for his election, said it was a great pleasure to him to receive such an honour. At the same time, they must all regret the reason of the absence from their midst of their former President, who was unable to continue the office for another term, to the great advancement of the interests of the Society, as they all believed. As for himself, they had done him (the President) a great honour, the more so as he had to confess to deficiency in times past in his attention to the affairs of the Society. He could only say that it would be his endeavour, while he held the office that they had done him the honour to confer upon him, to \"turn over a new leaf,\" and do\nall he possibly could by being present and assisting the Council and Secretary in all their work towards the furtherance of the objects of this great Society. And it was a great Society, for he thought that this country was unduly indifferent to its obligations in the matter of Oriental literature. This country was so bound up, commercially, socially, and morally with India, that it was a matter of regret and surprise that the nation, as a nation, took so small an interest in Oriental subjects, and that, when they wanted information on many such matters, they had to go to Germany or some other foreign country, wherein a deeper interest was taken in Oriental affairs than with us. In this respect he considered the nation owed much to the Royal Asiatic Society for promoting the culture of Oriental sciences and literature, and he trusted that, in this respect, it would even do more in the future than it had done in the past.\n\nProfessor Monier Williams, C.I.E., who had specially come from Oxford to give to the meeting some account of his recent visit to India and the Jaina and Buddhist temples there, was next called upon by the President to address the meeting. The Professor, who met with a cordial reception, said:\u2014Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u2014First, let me say that I have had great pleasure in hearing, in the report read by your Secretary, the reference to my late friend Mr. Eastwick. In the second place, let me say how delighted I am to see my friend Sir William Muir in the chair which he now occupies as President of your Society. He is, if I may say so, a square man in a square hole, and I am very much pleased to see him there. Next, it is expected that I should give you some account of my late travels in India, and I am told that I am to be limited to half an hour. Therefore, perhaps you will allow me to speak from notes, that I may the more rapidly address you. Let me first say that, notwithstanding my repeated visits to India, I feel more diffidence than ever in speaking before many here present,\nwho are much better acquainted with India than I am, and have done far better work there. Still India is changing so rapidly that many who left it even a few years ago will be interested in what I have to tell them. And, first, a few words about the Calcutta International Exhibition. During my stay of nearly a month, I went there almost every day. The Indian portion was in temporary buildings on the Maid\u0101n, opposite the Imperial Museum, and the non-Indian portion in the Museum itself and annexes. No one could have foreseen that the natives of all classes would have crowded into the Indian portion as they did, willingly paying their four annas each, not only men, but women; for one of the remarkable things was that the Exhibition opened the doors of many Zenanas. The women insisted on coming.\n\nTo one standing on the bridge connecting the Indian and non-Indian sections, the sight was extraordinary, and to both ethnologists and philologists afforded valuable lessons. A motley crowd of all peoples, races, tribes and castes, clothed in every variety of bright costume, and looking like a moving flower garden, pressed eagerly through the turnstiles, giving forth a confused Babel of loud voices in an infinite variety of dialects. Almost all thronged over the bridge towards the Indian portion. The non-Indian section, except, perhaps, the Australian, attracted few visitors. One great use of the Exhibition was that it seemed to teach the people to appreciate their own manufactures, arts and industries. In this way, I think, many extinct industries will be revived, and many new ones introduced. One had only to look at the beautiful wooden gates inlaid with T\u0101r-work, sent by Mr. Growse, from Bulandshahr, and the magnificent carved stone gateway, sent by Major Keith, M.R.A.S., from Gwalior, to be convinced of this. Nor must I omit to mention how interested I was in the economic court of Dr. Watt, with its 5000 different varieties of rice, and its unique collection of Indian products, from silks to poison, and its wonderful\nethnological treasures of all kinds. But, after all, the dead exhibits were not so interesting as the living. The Government projected a sort of living inter-ethnic exhibition, which was partially carried out. Living specimens of the various frontier tribes and aborigines were sent to Calcutta under the charge of trustworthy Europeans. I gazed every day at some fresh arrival of picturesque groups of N\u0101gas, \u0100khas, M\u012bris, Mishmis, Daflas, Lepchas, Lopas, in every variety of dress and half-dress. Dr. Vinton, an American missionary, brought most singular specimens of Karens, of whom there are six different tribes scattered throughout Burma. 50,000 of these Karens have been converted to Christianity, and Dr. Vinton is a kind of king among them. They have a legend that the Bible once existed among them, before the advent of the white missionary, but that they had negligently left it at the root of a tree. There fowls came and scattered dust over it, and dogs carried it off. To atone for this neglect, they have had to endure great sufferings for many generations, till the Bible has been now restored to them by the white men.\n\nThen there was a group of Nicob\u0101ris\u2014said to be of the Malay type\u2014from the Nicobar Islands, and about 20 Andamanese, brought by Mr. M. V. Portman, M.R.A.S. Believers in Darwinism must have gazed with delight at these odd specimens of humanity, with their coal-black skins, woolly hair, stumpy nature, and generally ape-like appearance. Of course, they ought to have been stark naked, with the exception of a few long leaves hanging down behind, and looking like a tail, but Mr. Portman had clothed them decently in white garments. He has mastered their language, or jargon, as it ought rather to be called, and told me that every word ends in D\u0101. He is sending me articles to illustrate their domestic life, such as it is, for they have no conception of a God, never cultivate the soil, but live on roots. Their only idea of music is striking a kind of wooden sounding-board,\nplaced on the ground, with one foot. Another great object of interest to me was the Burmese theatre. A play was being acted every day, or, rather, the same continuous play, which was no other than the story of R\u0101ma, from the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a. It was to last for 28 days at least, and consisted chiefly of a dialogue between R\u0101ma and S\u012bt\u0101, who kept circling round a small shrub stuck in the ground, which, I suppose, represented the forest to which R\u0101ma was banished. R\u0101ma occasionally smoked a cigar and varied his dialogue by stopping to expectorate. S\u012bt\u0101 was dressed in a tight dress, very like that worn by the women painted on the old willow pattern china. She now and then gave us a dance, so far as the limited range of her tight dress would allow. Some of the performers wore masks, and a band of musicians interposed at intervals with a discordant din. Then there was the Beng\u0101li-P\u0101\u1e6dha-\u015b\u0101l\u0101, or indigenous school, in a little annex, where twice a week boys were taught before a crowd of spectators. First, there was the chanting of the multiplication table by all the boys, in a shrill scream. Then the Palm-leaf class wrote the alphabet and tables on palm-leaves. Next, the Plantain-leaf class wrote sentences on plantain leaves. After that came the Paper class, where paper was used for writing. Then the printed book class, when a few printed books were used. Finally, the boys sang a hymn to the Goddess of Learning (Sarasvat\u012b), and to the Goddess of the Ganges (Gang\u0101). One of the most curious and instructive sights for a study of Indian life was to be seen in the refreshment sheds. Whether the Exhibition was personified or deified by the natives, and regarded as a kind of incarnation of Vish\u1e47u, who, as at Jagann\u0101th-puri, had the power of suspending caste, I know not; but, certainly, eating went on in these sheds with perfect freedom, and without fear of contamination from European eyes.\n\nAnd now permit me to say a few words about the centenary of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (founded by Sir\nW. Jones in 1784), which occurred while I was at Calcutta. A special meeting in celebration of the event took place at the fine rooms of the Society in Park Street, and a dinner afterwards. The Viceroy was present at the dinner, and made an excellent speech, and Mr. Reynolds, the President, gave an epitome of the history of the Society, speaking eulogistically of a galaxy of illustrious members of the Bengal Society, well known to all of us here\u2014Jones, Colebrooke, Carey, Harrington, H. H. Wilson, Brian Hodgson, James and H. T. Prinsep, Torrens, and many others, and referring to the Centenary Review of the history of the Society, written for the occasion by Dr. R\u0101jendral\u0101la Mitra.\n\nIn replying to the toast of \u201cThe Guests,\u201d I ventured to allude to my personal reminiscences of one specially honoured in this Society, whose portrait I see before me, our former President and Director, H. H. Wilson. Let me repeat to you what I said of him:\u2014\u201cI remember when I was a youngster, soon after I received my appointment in the Indian Civil Service, I was made to go and call on Horace Hayman Wilson, and my boyish exclamation on leaving his presence was\u2014\u2018What a dry old stick!\u2019 But I soon found out that beneath that \u2018dry\u2019 exterior a warmer and truer heart never throbbed, and that the \u2018stick\u2019 possessed an intellect as pointed as the Kusha-grass (Ku\u015b\u0101gra-buddhi), and full of the fire of genius, like the Vedio Aran\u012b. His death was to me like the death of a father; and I have ever since been an ardent worshipper of his memory and a humble follower in his footsteps.\u201d\n\nAnd, now, allow me to take you, for a few minutes, to two or three other places visited by me before I left India in March last. First, Darjeeling:\u2014I cannot help expressing my admiration of the engineers who constructed the marvellous railway, or, rather, steam tramway, from Silliguri right up to the heights which command the view of Mount Everest and Kinchingunga, the two highest moun-\ntains of the world. The little engine, dragging a light train, whisks round curves, and describes figures of '8' on the brink of precipices, with the ease of a figure-skater on the ice. Near Darjeeling I gained a few ideas about the Buddhism of Tibet. I visited one of the nearest monasteries and temples, saw the prayer-wheels turned, the prayer-flags flying, the wandering mendicants with their damarus, and the wild dances of the masqueraders, imitating the demon dance of the Ga\u1e47as of \u015aiva. The conclusion I came to was that the Bhutias, Lepchas, and Tibetans generally, know nothing of pure Buddhism. They mix it up with Hindu superstitions, and really worship the image of Buddha as if he existed as a god ready and able to benefit them. Their chief religion consists in the fear of evil spirits. The numbers and variety of the amulets worn by the people who frequent the Darjeeling bazaars is remarkable, and the magical efficacy of the Dhurj or Vajra for scaring demons is an article of universal faith.\n\nNext, about my visit to Buddha Gay\u0101. This, in my opinion, is now one of the wonders of India, and, perhaps, one of the most interesting spots in the whole world. Here, as every one knows, was the sacred Pipal-tree, under which, after six years of austerity and meditation, the young Prince Gautama was converted into the Buddha, and from which, as from a central focus, radiated that faith which now claims more adherents than any other of the religions of the world. Here, when I visited the place in 1876, there was a striking tower-like pagoda, still in fair preservation, with a terrace round it, and a veritable descendant of the Buddha's Sacred Fig-tree, which some Burmese of high rank, who had come to see the Prince of Wales at Calcutta, were in the act of worshipping. Now, during the past two years, General Cunningham and Mr. Beglar, his assistant, have\u2014mirabile dictu\u2014changed all this, and no little abuse have they justly incurred in consequence. The old temple is\nsaid to be still there, but is no longer to be seen. It is incased by an entirely new brick structure, painted of a yellowish colour and resembling a huge Burmese pagoda, with a lofty central and two subordinate side towers. The central tower is 196 feet high, and crowned by a pointed umbrella-ornament, in seven tiers. The whole has cost a lac of rupees and is now quite finished, except that I noticed the remains of the bambu scaffolding over the entrance, where some projecting ornamentation has still to be completed.\n\nSpeaking in this place with little knowledge of art, and in the presence of Mr. Fergusson, I must leave Mr. Beglar to his tender mercies, but I trust Mr. Fergusson will allow me to express my admiration of Mr. Beglar as a most devoted and conscientious worker in the field of archaeology. Doubtless, after having, eight years ago, had the old temple and its surroundings impressed indelibly on my mind, I stood for some minutes astounded, not to say almost speechless and petrified with astonishment, on first beholding the transformation; but, on looking down on the spacious excavated quadrangle which surrounds the new structure, with its beautifully-carved stone railings, with its recently-unearthed side temples and tombs, with its sacred trees and innumerable images of Buddha in eight or nine different attitudes, with its myriads of votive stupas, small and large, piled one on the other in countless layers, I must confess that my feelings, in the end, experienced a revulsion. Whatever may be the verdict with regard to the restored temple, General Cunningham and Mr. Beglar have most assuredly accomplished a great work in these excavations. A more marvellous disentombment of a kind of necropolis is not to be seen anywhere else, not even in Pompeii. The old Pipal-tree was transplanted by Mr. Beglar to a neighbouring garden, and efforts were made to preserve it, but the Burmese pilgrims have, out of their excessive devotion, killed it by watering it with Eau-de-Cologne. Several\nof these pilgrims were worshipping before the principal image of Buddha in the shrine at the basement of the great tower when I entered. They bowed down and touched the stone floor, and presented a curious mixture of offerings, consisting of rice, flowers, tin boxes of sardines, Huntley and Palmer's biscuits, Eau-de-Cologne, and packets of gold leaf, all the time intoning prayers. After finishing their worship, they occupied themselves for several hours in gilding the image with the gold leaf. I noticed that just behind the temple a rich Buddhist from Ceylon had quite recently set up a large horizontal stone tablet, with an inscription giving the old date of the Nirv\u0101\u1e47a of Buddha, B.C. 543, not accepting new theories. On the right of the temple entrance is a raised platform of earth with a Pipal-tree growing on it, and idols of Vishnu and \u015aiva set up under it. Here two or three groups of Hindus were performing \u015ar\u0101ddhas with balls of rice, while some Buddhist pilgrims stood near, worshipping the tree. It struck me as an interesting exemplification of the intertwining of Buddhism with Hinduism and their interconnection and mutual toleration.\n\nOne of my chief objects in visiting India this time was to learn more about the Jains, and I am bound to confess that I learnt very little beyond what I knew already, for the Jains themselves are very ignorant of their own religion. Yet I went to some of their most sacred places, especially to the Hill of P\u0101ra\u015b-n\u0101th and Mount Abu. The former is called \u015aikhar, and is held by the Jains to be their most sacred place of pilgrimage in India. The reason is that more Jainas or Tirtham-karas have attained beatitude at P\u0101ra\u015b-n\u0101th than anywhere else. Hence, it is crowded with shrines of the 24 Jaina saints. The finest shrine at the very top had been recently struck by lightning and nearly destroyed. Long lines of pilgrims, in bright-coloured dresses, continually passed me. They toil up the whole height of 4500 feet, and neither eat nor drink till their\nreturn. Rows of lepers lined the pathway, and I was told that a contractor brings them from all parts of India to work on the feelings of the pilgrims, and extract money from them.\n\nOf all the Jain temples, none I saw anywhere equalled those on Mount Abu. The stone carvings there are exquisite, and the surrounding scenery is beautiful. Most of the Jain temples all over India are in charge of Brahmins. Two Digambara Jains, who visited me at Jaypur, spoke Sanskrit fluently and wore the Brahminical thread. They did not deny that they were half Brahmins, and held most of the tenets of Hinduism, except the infallibility of the Vedas. Their sacred books are in Sanskrit, yet are little known to us; whereas the sacred books of the other great division of the Jains\u2014the \u015avet\u0101mbaras\u2014are in M\u0101gadhi Pr\u0101krit, and are well known to European scholars, indeed, some have been printed. Dr. Weber has just given a long account of them in his *Indische Studien*. The two sects of Jains, without actually quarrelling, have no great love for each other. I believe the Digambaras, whose images are quite naked, are the elder sect, though this is often denied. They freely admitted me into their temples, whereas the \u015avet\u0101mbaras excluded me. As to the relative antiquity of Jainism and Buddhism, this is a disputed point which I cannot myself think yet settled. A\u015boka is claimed as the patron of both Buddhists and Jains. The probability is that there was formerly one school of free thought which split into two branches, just as all other Indian schools of religious thought seem to do, and each then claims to have preceded the other.\n\nBefore concluding, let me say how much I have been impressed by the wealth of ancient monuments scattered everywhere throughout India. Many, I fear, are gradually suffering irreparable injury from the climate. I saw one exquisite Mahomedan tomb near Gwalior, quite as lovely in its way as the T\u0101j, falling into decay, and the unique Vajr\u0101sana, or\nthunderbolt throne of Buddha, though protected by brick walls, is exposed to the rain, and its curious markings are being effaced. I heard with deep regret that the office of Curator of Ancient Monuments has just been abolished, and with it the office of Assistant Curator, in which Major Keith has done such excellent service. Both will, I trust, be resuscitated in some form or other. There is work for a whole army of archaeologists in India, and inscriptions enough for a thousand Mr. Fleets to decipher. With regard to the Indian Institute at Oxford, I am happy to tell you that I have brought back an immense number of specimens of the arts and produce of India, together with books for its library, and that the Supreme Government of Calcutta has assented to my proposal for founding six scholarships for deserving natives. This was one of my principal objects in making my recent journey, and I am now awaiting with some anxiety the approval of the Home Government, without which the scholars cannot be appointed.
