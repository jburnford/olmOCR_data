To prepare a new Index would have been impossible, so the plan adopted has been to rearrange in one alphabetical list all the separate indices which have been appended to each volume. The result has been to give a practically complete view of the subjects dealt with in the forty-three volumes hitherto published. In the list of Authors, which has been added, those who wrote in the 'Asiatic Researches' are also included. Proper names are spelt in the Index, not according to the modern system, but according to the usage of the authors themselves.\n\nThe abbreviations used are:\u2014\n\nTrans. for the Transactions.\no.s. for the Old Series of the Journal.\nn.s., New \", \"\n\nand the numbers quoted are those of the pages.\n\nA, the prefix, in Semitic, XIV. 112, n.s.\nA, the termination, often, in Assyrian, weakened into i, IX. 36, n.s.\nAbacus, the use of, perhaps introduced into India from Bactria, XIV. 353, n.s.; suggested origin of this name, 354; the great importance of this instrument, and its remote antiquity, XV. 8, n.s.; etymology of, probably Phoenician, 9.\nAbbas Mirza, Prince Royal of Persia, biographical sketch of, I. 322, o.s.; notice of his death, iv.\nAbbaside coins, VII. 262, n.s.\nAbdulmutalib, V. 303, n.s.\nAbe no Miushi, one of the suitors of the Lady Kaguya, and how he failed in the task imposed on him by her, XIX. 16, n.s.\nAbbaya-giri, the d\u0101gaba erected B.C. 89, XX. 173, n.s.\nAbhinava M\u0101nga R\u0101ja, the author of a valuable dictionary in Kannada verse on the plan of the Amara-Kosha, XV. 313, n.s.\n\u0100bh\u012bras, V. 58, n.s.\nAbhisamay\u0101lank\u0101ra, VIII. 41, n.s.\nAbhishekanirukti, VIII. 27, n.s.\nAbhish\u0113ka P\u0101ndyan, III. 207, o.s.\nAbjad, the Arabic, arbitrary in its assignment of numerical powers to letters, XIV. 352, n.s.\nAbkh\u0101s or Abas language spoken in the Caucasus, XVII. 155, n.s.\nAbkhazian, vocabulary of, XIX. 146, n.s.\nAboo Huneefa, conditions stated by, under which a country once Dar-ool-Islam becomes Dar-ool-Hurb, XIII. 433, n.s.\nAboulghazi, distinction drawn by, between cultivated Turkish and the rude Chagatai, XII. 374, n.s.\nAbramam, town of, III. 175, o.s.; lake, 183.\nAbrech, derivation of the word, XVIII. 530, n.s.\nAb\u016b Hanifah, II. 81, o.s.\nAbu Shahrein, Notes on, by J.
