Barnes, Colonial Secretary of Hongkong, which took place in Hongkong on October 28th of this year (1911).\n\nMr. Barnes, born in 1865, was educated at King's College School and Pembroke College Cambridge. He joined the S. S. Government service in 1888, held various appointments, chiefly in connection with the Chinese Protectorates in this Colony and the F. M. S., became Secretary for Chinese Affairs for the S. S. and F. M. S. in 1904, Resident of Pahang in 1910, and then left here early this year on his appointment as Colonial Secretary in Hongkong.\n\nMr. Barnes was elected a member of the Society in 1893 when he was still in Penang, and his chief activity in connection with it was during the years 1908 and 1909 when he was Vice-President for Singapore, and in 1910, as Vice-President for the F. M. S. It was due to his initiative and supervision that a Catalogue of the Society's Library was compiled and printed in 1909, and he also undertook the laborious task of compiling a most useful index volume to the Society's Journal Nos. 1-50.\n\nHis own contributions to former Nos. of the Journal are:\n\nA Trip to Gunong Benom, Pahang, No. XXXIX, pp. 1-10\nSchmidt's Sakai and Semang Languages, No. XXXIX, pp. 38-45\nKern's Sanskrit Inscriptions, Malay Peninsula, No. XLIX, pp. 95-101.\n\nHis three papers in the present Journal, viz.\n\"Singapore Old Straits and New Harbour\"\n\"An Old Royal Cemetery at Pekan in Pahang,\" and\n\"An Old Tombstone in Pahang\"\nwere printed off some weeks before his death.\n\nR. Hanitsch,\nActg. Hon. Secretary.\nBarretto de Resende's Account of Malacca.\n\nBy W. George Maxwell.\n\nManuscript No. 197 of the Sloane collection of manuscripts in the British Museum is Barretto de Resende's \"Livro do Estado da India Oriental.\" The manuscript, which has not yet been published or translated, is divided into three parts. The first contains portraits of all the Portuguese Viceroys from Francisco de Almeyda, the first Viceroy, to Dom Miguel de Noronha, the 44th, in A.D. 1634, with an account of the Government of each Viceroy.\n\nThe second part contains \"the plans of the fortresses from the Cape of Good Hope to the fort Chaul, with a detailed description of all that is to be found in the said fortresses, the receipts and expenses of each and everything that concerns them.\" In this part are a plan and description of the fortress of Sofala, a map and description of the rivers of Cuama, a description of the Islands of Angoxa; plans and descriptions of the fortresses of Mozambique, Mombassa, Curiate, Mascate, Matara, Sibo, Borea, Soar, Quelha, Corfacam, Libidia, Mada, Dubo-doba and Mocomlim; a plan of the fortress of Ormus, a description of the Congo; plans and descriptions of Bassora, and the Island of Baren; descriptions of Sinde and the Kingdom of Cacha and Magana; plans and descriptions of the fortress of Dio, Suratte, Damas, Samgens, Danu, Trapor, Maim, Agassym, Manora, Mount Aserim and Bassaym; descriptions of the Fort of Saybana, the Fort of Corangangens, Tana and its bastions, Mombayon and Caranya, and plans and descriptions of the mole of Chaul and of Chaul.*\n\nThe third part of the book contains \"the plans of all the fortresses from Goa to China with a similar description and contains also plans of other fortresses not belonging to the State, they being included as being situated on these coasts and being of interest.\" In this part are plans and descriptions of the lands and forts of Bardes', Goa, Rachol, Salsete, Onor, Cambolim, Barselor, Mangallor, Cananor, Cunhalle and Cranganor; a description of Balliporto; plans and descriptions of Cochim, Conlam, Negapatam, San Thome, \"the Dutch town of Palleacate\", Pulikat and the Island and Fortress of Manar; a plan of the island of Ceylon; plans and descriptions of the fortress of Jafnapatam, Colombo, Calleture, Negumbo, Gualle, Batecalou and Triquilimale;\n\n* The accounts of these places will be found (in Portuguese) in the appendix to the fourth volume of the Hakluyt Society's Commentaries of Afonso Dalboquerque.\n\n\u00a7 Notes on the plans of these fortresses state that they were demolished and abandoned as being of no use after the book was written.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 60. 1911\na plan of the Maldiv\u00e9 Islands; a plan and description of the fortress of Malacca; plans of the isle and fort of Achem, \"the Dutch fortress of Jacatra\" (the site of the present city of Batavia), the Malucco Islands and the Banda Islands; plans and descriptions of the Solor Islands and the town of Machao; and plans of the Island of Formosa and the Island and Province of Manilla. It concludes with notes on the size and extent of various islands.\n\nThe manuscript, which consists of 412 folios, sets forth on its first page that it was written by \"Captain Pedro Barretto de Resende, Professed Knight of the Order of St. Benedict of Avis,\" native of Pavia, in the year 1646.\"\n\nWriting in Kedah, I regret to be unable to obtain any account of de Resende's life.\n\nWith two or three exceptions the plans are all coloured, and in addition to them the manuscript contains eight pen and ink charts signed:\n\n\"Petrus Berthelot primum cosmographicum indicorum imperium faciebat anno domini 1635.\"\n\nBerthelot was born in Honfleur in A.D. 1600. He was for some time a pirate, and then became a barefooted Carmelite monk. He went to Goa, and in 1629 was appointed first pilot to a Portuguese fleet sent to defend Malacca against the attack of the King of Acehen.\n\nHe greatly distinguished himself and was given the appointment of Cosmographer Royal of the Indies. After this he made a number of voyages and prepared charts of the coasts he visited. He fell in a massacre, in which the Portuguese ambassador was also killed, at Acehen on the 27th November 1638.\n\nIt would appear that the date, A.D. 1646, given by de Resende to his work is that of a year some years after the date of its having been written. The list of viceroys only goes down to 1638. Malacca is written of as a Portuguese possession, whereas it had been surrendered to the Dutch on the 14th January, 1641. There are notes on some of the plans (referred to above) to say that the fortresses of which plans are given had been demolished and abandoned \"after the book was written.\" Lastly Berthelot the cosmographer was murdered in A.D. 1635, or 1638. The probabilities would therefore appear to be that the account of Malacca was written at least before 1638.\n\n* A military order of Cistercians in Portugal instituted by King Alphonso I, in the middle of the twelfth century, to commemorate the capture of Evora from the Moors.\n\n\u00a7 An account of Berthelot will be found in the Manuel de Bibliographie Normande\u2014Vol I p. 336. (Fr\u00e8re, Paris 1850\u20141860); cited in the commentaries of Afonso Dalboquerque (Hakluyt Society) Vol 2\u2014Introduction page CXXI.\n\n* The date of this Massacre is given in Marsden's History of Sumatra (page 362) as 1635. 1638 is perhaps a misprint in the Hakluyt Society's volume.\nOf the plans, charts, and portraits with which Barretto de Resende's manuscript is embellished, six have been reproduced in the Hakluyt Society's edition of the Commentaries of Afonso Dalboquerque. They are:\n\n- The map of Arabia in Vol: I. p. 80\n- The plan of Ormus ,, p. 112\n- The portrait of D. Francisco Dalmeida ,, II. p. 48\n- The chart of Goa ,, p. 88\n- The plan of the fortress of Malacca ,, III. p. 137\n- The portrait of Diogo Lopes de Sequeira ,, p. 254\n\nGohindo de Eredia's account of Malacca\u2014the Declaracam de Malaca e India Meridional dated A.D. 1613, and translated into French by Janssen in A.D. 1882, is the best known Portuguese work on Malacca, and as a comparison of his account and as Resende's account is interesting, give in an appendix a translation of de Eredia's first and fifteenth chapters entitled \"Regarding the city of Malaca\" and \"Regarding Gunoledam\" respectively. I have translated them from Janssen's French, and not from the original Portuguese.\n\nDescription of the Fortress of Malacca.\n\nThe fortress of Malacca is situated on the east coast of Jun-tana between the River Panagim and Muar \\(2^\\circ 20' \\text{ N. lat}\\).\n\nIt was conquered and founded by the great Alfonso de Albuquerque on the 15th of August 1511. At the present day it is a city, containing a fortress, and surrounded by a stone and mortar wall twenty feet high, twelve palms thick at the foot and seven at the top.\n\nIt contains six bastions, including the breastwork (coura\u00e7a), each one called by the name written on it. All the walls have parapets, and each bastion occupies a space of twenty paces and the one named Madre de Deos double that space, so that it can scarcely be defended and covered by the other bastions. The circumference of the whole wall is five hundred and twelve paces, including the space occupied by the bastions. From the bastion de Ospital to that of St. Dominic there is a counterscarp, as also from that of Sanctiago to Madre de Deos, with a ditch in the centre, the whole being fourteen palms wide. The bastions contain forty-one pieces of artillery of twelve to forty-four pounds iron shot. All are of bronze, with the exception of nine iron pieces, and there is sufficient powder and ammunition in His Majesty's magazines for their supply. Twelve of the big pieces lie unmounted on the plain, destined for the fort in process of building on the Ilha das Naos, and some of the remainder are broken.\nThere are in the town two hundred and fifty married whites who would possess two thousand black captives of different races, all competent to carry arms, of which there is a sufficient supply; as rarely is a married man without his supply of lances, and six, eight or ten muskets or flintlocks, with their ammunition. However of these two hundred and fifty married white men, one hundred live on the other side of the river which gives its name to the land of Malacca.\n\nWith regard to the small space within the walls it is almost entirely covered by three convents, that of St. Paul, St. Dominic and St. Augustin; and the aforesaid married couples live in straw huts, so that there is a great risk of fire. There are in this place a number of fruit gardens and orchards of varied fruits. A number of married native Christians live outside Malacca, they are all very good soldiers, and use all kinds of arms, especially muskets, in the use of which they are very skilful. In times of war they are very ready and active: the majority of them seek a means of livelihood. They are so hasty, for very little they will run a man through the belly with a cris, and there is little, if any, cure for the wound, since these weapons, apart from being generally poisoned, are so fashioned, in an undulating shape, as to cause great injury: if the weapon is poisoned, it is only necessary to draw blood to cause death.\n\nThe fort within this town where the Captain resides is five stories high; the captain lives on the second storey, which is square like the tower, each wall being twenty paces wide. The other apartments are set apart for the Captain's guests, and for storing ammunition. On the first floor four thousand candys of rice were stored, but are no longer there. It is surrounded by a wall of the same height and thickness as that of the town. The Captain's family lives in houses on a level with the second storey of the tower. The only artillery is that of the bastions already referred to. The town receives a duty of one per cent applicable to the works of fortification, of which those of the wall are now being completed.\n\nThe king of the interior of that country where the fortress of Malacca is situated is the King of Jor and Pam, a great friend of the Portuguese. He is lord of more than one hundred leagues of coast, but his lands do not extend far inland: at sea he also possesses a chain of islands situated in this vicinity, the majority being inhabited. The people are Malays, and profess the creed of the Moors. They can put twelve thousand men of arms into the field; they fight with artillery, muskets, assegays, saligas, or darts of fire-hardened wood, swords, shields, bows and arrows, crises beforementioned, and sumpitans or very small poisoned arrows, which they blow through tubes, and if they draw blood death will ensue. There is no Christain Settlement in their lands. Up the river beyond Malacca, the married men own many very fertile orchards, with a great variety of fruit, as the land produces\nvery good fruit of many kinds, besides all those to be found in India, and it is remarkable that the town, though nearly below the line, has a salubrious climate and excellent water, the soil being fertile for any seed that is sown: it rains nearly every day and night. The married men of Malacca possess many leagues of land, extending on one side as far as Cape Rachado and on the other to River Fernozo and also many leagues in the interior, but all uninhabited with none to cultivate the land, though it is fertile and would yield much rice. Inland the land borders on that of the Manamcabos, Moors of a land called Rindo, vassals of the King of Pam, and, close by live five or six thousand of the same Manamcabo Moors, vassals of His Majesty, under the Government of a Portuguese married man of Malacca called Tamungam, an office conferred by the Viceroy. To him they owe obedience and should one of these Moors die without heirs, the said Tamungam inherits his property, and if there are heirs he makes an agreement with them and receives ten per cent upon such goods as he thinks fit. At the present day a Portuguese holds the office for life. These Moors cultivate extensive lands by which they maintain themselves. They especially cultivate the betre. They purchase tin from the inhabitants of the interior and bring it to Malacca. The river of this city, and the port of Malacca is of fresh water and is a stone's throw in width. At low tide the bar has a palm and a half of water, and in conjunction with the fresh water there is four fingers of water only, which barely covers the mud which forms the bottom. At high water there is one fathom four palms of fresh water and five or six palms of salt. At a little distance from its mouth the river becomes narrower, and is three or four fathoms deep; and in some parts there is always one fathom whether at high or low tide. There are many large carnivorous alligators, for which reason, and because of the mud, it cannot be forded. Along the river and inland there are many orchards belonging both to the married Portuguese and the natives: the men live here with their families cultivating the land to great profit. There are many tigers which before they were exorcised by a bishop were very fierce, but are now less so. All these married men have their weapons. Half a league up the river a log of wood is thrown across the water at night, the chain being padlocked to a sentry-box where stands a Portuguese provided by the city, which pays him six cruzados a month. This is to prevent any forbidden merchandise being smuggled out or in from the large vessels lying at anchor beyond the Ilha das Naos. For the same reason, order has been given to build a fort on the said island, which does not actually face the city, but lies a little lower down at a distance of one thousand five hundred paces from it. The channel in between is small and not navigable to large ships at low tide: the water is very shallow, and the bottom is of mud. Further out to sea, lies another sand-bank, and, between it and the island, is a channel six fathoms deep. The island is nearly the shape of a\nhorseshoe, and is sixty bracas in circumference, its length is one and a half times greater than its width. It contains a mountain four or five bracas in height.\n\nThe fort which is being built here, for the foundations are already laid, is small, being thirty paces square. It is to be square, to allow space for the artillery to be separated. Its purpose is to defend the large vessels which cannot lie under the artillery of the fortress. As yet only the foundations are laid; the materials are being gathered together at Malacca so that the whole building may be finished at once, because if it were built gradually it might fall into the hands of the enemy and, once occupied by them, it would be a great danger to Malacca.\n\nThe bridge shown in the plan has two abutments, each one being two and a half bracas in height, and the same in length and very narrow, so that there is no danger, as has been suggested, of them affording the means of an attack upon Malacca. The bridge above them is composed of large strong planks, which can be cut down when necessary.\n\nFifty to sixty soldiers are drawn from the garrison every year to equip a fleet of three, four or five jaleas\\(^{22}\\) to cruise along the coast. They set sail in May for Pulopinam\\(^{21}\\) or whatever place is decided on, to await the ships from Goa, to inform them of the position of the enemy and to assist in discharging the cargo. In September they go to Junsalam\\(^{24}\\) to await those from Negapatam, St. Thome and also from Goa; and in December they go to the Straits of Singapore to await those from China and Manila for the same purpose.\n\nThe Captain Major receives an allowance of one hundred cruzados, but the soldiers and the captains of the jaleas receive nothing whatever beyond their food; but are quite satisfied. The captainship of these jaleas is a much sought after and coveted post, because in the many losses caused to our ships, from all parts, by the Dutch, the jaleas get the best of the booty: but the worst is that they do not return it to the owners. This applies especially to the ships from China, because of the great value of the salvage, being gold, silks and musk. Neither can it be denied that these jaleas save many vessels, and much merchandise; but it is very necessary that they should be in the hands of persons very disinterested and conscientious, a virtue rare among soldiers. The sailors are the chief expense of these jaleas, as they carry over fifty, about twenty-three being required to take the oars on either side, besides the two at the helm and stern, the extra men being required to replace those who may fall sick or become fatigued. Each sailor receives one para\\(^{25}\\) of rice, a little over an alquerie,\\(^{26}\\) per month, and a cruzado of four hundred and sixty reis the whole time that they are on board. A jalea is the swiftest vessel at sea, being about fifty palms long, and four palms deep, and rowed by forty-six oars. They are of great use in carrying news and relief, and can evade the enemy; so that the more there are the better service\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nthey may render. Other vessels are sent out from Malacca with\nadvices such as bantims, very much smaller than jaleas the only\nexpense being, as aforesaid, the sailors, and the provisions for the\nsoldiers. The latter, who receive their pay on shore at rare\nintervals, embark with much good will; because, at times, when\nthey put in at a certain place such as Pera, and other ports, they\ncan earn a quartel from the merchants. They are not discharged\nfrom the fortress when they thus go to sea, neither do they lose\ntheir pay; but, while away from the fortress, they are masters.\nBut for this no soldier would remain in the fortress for the King\u2019s\npay is very small and the country very dear. Even as it is, it is a\nsource of wonder that any soldiers are found who will remain\nthere.\n\nOne thing may be said of the married women of this land\nwhich is greatly to their credit; and that is that there is not one\nwho would ask for any help from her husband towards the expenses\nof the home, which really is their support; for they themselves\nsupply the household money by making eatables which are usually\nsold in the streets by their slaves, and their houses take the place\nof inns in the town. Their daughters are brought up from child-\nhood to the same custom, so that there is no girl who has not her\nown fortune put aside in this way in her father\u2019s house; and thus,\nas in India, girls are not afraid of their husbands not being able to\nsupport them; for this reason too persons of much merit are\nsatisfied with a small dowry. This custom has greater effect in\nthis country than in India.\n\nAs regards the merchandise in the fortress of Malacca very\nlittle is of the country, and the greater part is imported. The chief\nproducts of the country are tin, some bezoar stones, porcupine\nquills and wild agallochium. A certain quantity of Japam, or\nred wood, for dyes, of somewhat less value than that of Brazil,\nis brought from the interior. All the southern commodities and\nmerchandise from China and cloths from Cambay and the Coro-\nmandel coast are imported. All the southern tribes were wont to\ncome here to buy in exchange for other merchandise so that the\ncommerce was very extensive, and profits no less; but now it is\nalmost entirely extinct, for never or rarely do any natives come to\nMalacca to seek anything: having all they require from the Dutch.\nBut nevertheless voyages are still undertaken from Malacca to\nmany parts, China, Manila, and Cochin-China being the principal\npoints of destination and the less important voyages being to\nPatane. As Siam is now at war, communication with Camboja,\nChampa and those parts, which would otherwise be very frequent,\nis interrupted. The ships bear to the South to avoid the windy\nseason which in Malacca is from April to end of August.\n\nThe merchandise carried to these places is as follows:\u2014\nTo Patane, stuffs from Cambay and all the Coromandel coast,\naccording to the stuffs in use, as every southern tribe follows a\ndifferent fashion. From Patane, patacas, some gold, good bezoar\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 69, 1911.\nstones, rice, meats, vegetables, black cane sugar, oils, all kinds of provisions and the best fowls and capons of all the southern lands.\n\nThis kingdom of Patane is governed solely by a woman in accordance with a very ancient custom.\\(^{35}\\) It is one hundred and fifty leagues from Malacca along the coast and can be reached without encountering the northern monsoon, more especially if the voyage is made in baloons\\(^{36}\\) (which resemble ships of war being wider but not so long, having oars, two masts and two helms called camudes)\\(^{37}\\) or in Malay galleys (which are smaller than our panchelois,\\(^{38}\\) and which are really neither galleys nor baloons, but more closely resemble the latter than the former) and in bantims of the size of a manchua,\\(^{39}\\) which are very swift vessels with oars and masts. The last are the vessels most in use along the coast of Malacca; they are manned by Christian Malays of Malacca, who carry their guns and powder flasks.\n\nThe King of Camboja, where there is a church and fathers of the Society, is very friendly to the Portuguese. There is here a quantity of very thick angely wood;\\(^{40}\\) and very good benzoin\\(^{41}\\) and almond milk\\(^{42}\\) and excellent lac\\(^{43}\\) are brought in, and a quantity of rice better and cheaper than that of Bengal. The majority of the inhabitants are Japanese and Chinese Christians of bad character who have been expelled from Manila by the Spaniards; and therefore they are the bitterest of our foes. In this kingdom there is an abundance of calambae\\(^{44}\\) and agallochium.\\(^{31}\\) There are two or three ports on the coast of Champa where the Portuguese go to trade taking black cattle from China and some gold thread, which they exchange for black wood much bigger and better than that of Mozambique. There is here a church and Christian Settlement with a father of the Society.\n\nBeyond lies the kingdom of Cochin China and at the entrance to its port is situated an island where the fathers of the Society have a Christian Settlement. It is called Pullo Cambim. Within the said port, too, the same fathers have a church and a Christian Settlement.\n\nBesides this island there are two ports in this kingdom frequented by the Portuguese for commerce. In one resides the King, and the other is called Turan. The Portuguese had a better welcome here than anyone else and quantities of stuffs are brought here. The contract is however now broken through the violence of the Captain of Malacca and only ships from China go there. Some calambac,\\(^{44}\\) an abundance of agallochium,\\(^{31}\\) and a quantity of copper is obtained from the said kingdom, it is carried there by Malays and Japanese.\n\nThe shortest voyages taken from Malacca are those to Pam, a port eighty leagues from Malacca. It belongs to the aforesaid king, who is very friendly to the Portuguese and is lord also of Jor and the maritime islands. Any ships may come to this port from Malacca without hindrance. They bring stuffs and opium in exchange for gold dust\\(^{45}\\) of the country and gold coin, bezoar\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nstones, porcupine quills, a quantity of rice, agallochium from the coast, and also some wares which have been brought here by the southern natives who will not go to Malacca. In the same land there are two rivers belonging to the same king, where the Portuguese go to trade in the same merchandise. Facing this place to the sea lies the small mountainous island of Pulo Timo thickly populated by Malays. Pigeons are plentiful, and there is a certain kind of animal called palandos, which resembles a deer and is very good and fat. There are very fine fresh water fish, rivers of excellent water, and an abundance of figs and tar. The anchorage close in to land is in 25 fathoms.\n\nPort Jor lies inland from Point Romania. It is once again becoming inhabited, and many galleys and other vessels are being built there. There is an abundance of provisions, agallochium and tar.\n\nOn the other side, in the chain of islands called Bintang, lies the town of Bintang, which is once again inhabited. It is thickly populated, and has many fortifications for fear of Achem. This King of Jor and Pam has other inhabited but unimportant islands in this vicinity.\n\nHere close to the Straits of Singapore, is the port of Bulla, thickly populated with Malays and frequented to excess by numbers of merchants from all the southern tribes, who come here to sell their wares, from which the King of Pam receives great profit. They come here rather than go to Malacca because of the great abuses committed by the captains of that fortress, who buy their merchandise at a price much lower than the current price of the country and also compel them to accept their money: a thing which is very usual in all the towns and fortresses of the Portuguese State; and which causes as much misery as the Dutch themselves. To such an extent is the abuse carried that even when Christians come to these ports of Malacca to trade in certain kinds of merchandise the captain seizes their wares, assessing them at a price below their real value and using much abuse: and for this reason some merchants bring their wares to the customs house at night time in order to pay duty to the customs official in secret. All this is the cause of great losses to Malacca.\n\nOn the other side of the island on the coast of Sumatra lies the port of Jambi, on a deep and rapid river, which contains a large body of water. The Dutch are much welcomed here and have a factory and a large trade in pepper. Further on, a little distance from this port, towards Malacca, is the large river Andregy, where the Dutch also procure a quantity of pepper. There are other rivers from which pepper and agallochium are exported, of which no special mention is made because they are unimportant. The port of Siaca, also inhabited by Malays, is close to the Island of Sabam, which is nearer to Malacca. Here at every new and full moon great fairs are held where all the merchandise of the south is sold, gold, precious stones, bezoar stones, agallochium, calambac,\nprovisions and many other things. From this port up a river which empties itself opposite Malacca is the Bay of Bengalis, in Sumatra on the other side of Malacca where a similar fair is held every full moon, where, besides the aforesaid wares, a quantity of fresh and salt pork is sold, and the roe of shad fish, which they call trubo, great quantities of which are exported from Malacca to all ports. Here in the Bay of Bengalis is the river das Galles, all of which is under the dominion of the King of Pam, who has always been Emperor of the South. The Straits of Singapore, before referred to, is the place where the Dutch lie in wait for the Portuguese ships coming from China, Manila, Macassar, and all the Malucco Archipelago. It has many channels so narrow that in places the branches of the trees on shore touch the ships; and the currents are very strong. The water, though deep, is so clear that the fishes can be seen swimming about in it. Fish is brought by the merchants of the ships from the Saletes, or inhabitants of the Straits, who live in very swift baloons with their families. They catch the fish by spearing them in the water, and then sell them. These Saletes are a wicked people and especially so to the Portuguese. They are evil-hearted and treacherous, and the best spies the Dutch possess. Wherever, of the many places in this vicinity, our ships may be, they immediately inform the Dutch and lead them there; so that most of our losses are due to them. This is because the Dutch give a great share of all thus seized. And thus it is very necessary that our fleets of jaleus and ships that go to these straits to wait for the said fleets should make war as much as possible on these Salletes, and drive them from these parts.\n\nThe most important voyages undertaken from Malacca are, as beforementioned, those to China, all the southern merchandise being exported there from Malacca, but now nothing but a little pepper is exported and little, if any, cloves: our trade and the rest is in the hands of the Dutch, who are lords of the Ilhas de Banda, from whence they drove out the natives; who wander homeless throughout the southern lands, waiting some opportunity of revenge and of regaining their lands. The other exports to China are the same as those which come from India, and as regards Manila what is brought from there has also been already stated. It is a law of Malacca that no boat coming from the region of the said straits, shall pass without putting in at Malacca and paying duties on all the cargo, the rate being ten per cent and further two per cent to the town for the fortification and artillery. And it has happened that some vessels which have passed without putting in at the fortress have been supposed to be lost.\n\nThere is communication also between Malacca and Macassar, an island three hundred leagues west of Malacca, belonging to a Moorish King who knows the Portuguese tongue very well, and has many Portuguese in his lands and is very friendly to them. Stuff's only are taken there in exchange for the merchandise brought to the place by the southern tribes. The land yields an\nabundance of provisions of tortoise shell, and Malacca receives its chief supplies from it. All parts of the state are in communication with this island. It has churches and fathers who administer the sacraments to the Portuguese residents and visitors. This King has promised not to receive the Dutch in his lands, but he has Danish and English residents. When this king and all his people were heathens, he sent to Malacca for a priest to instruct him in the Christian creed, which he intended to adopt if it pleased him. It is said that there was more delay than there should have been in such an important matter, and that a sailor, a Moor called Lucar, arrived at the country in the meantime and taught his creed to the King, who considered it so good that he immediately adopted it.\n\nFrom Malacca to Pera is a distance of forty leagues of coast to the east. The King of this place was for many years a vassal of His Majesty and paid in tribute a large quantity of tin. Three years ago he refused the tribute saying that only if His Majesty would deliver him from the King of Achem he would be His Majesty's vassal and pay tribute. He said that the numerous fleets from Achem, which throng these seas, frequently attacked his lands devastating them and taking the people captive. He well knew, he said, how much more important it was to be His Majesty's vassal than to be vassal of the King of Achem. He said that he had no power however to resist the tyrant and his great forces, and that if His Majesty did not supply the means, he himself must seek a remedy in his own kingdom by becoming a vassal of the King of Achem, and paying to him the tribute he formerly paid to His Majesty. In spite of this, he was able to resist our fleet when it was sent chastise him.\n\nThere are great tin mines in his kingdom, the metal of which we have already spoken, and thus five or six quintals\\(^{57}\\) of tin are yearly extracted from them. The greater part of it formerly came to Malacca, but now not a third part is sent there. The rest is taken by the Dutch to Achem, and thence they carry it to India with great profit.\n\nThe factory possessed by the Captain of Malacca at Pera was one which at one time yielded greater profit than any other. But now it yields nothing, and for this and other reasons the fortress has become so ruined that in the year 1633 no one could be found willing to fill the post of captain; and a captain was appointed and sent by the viceroy.\n\n**NOTES.**\n\nA corruption of the Malay words *ujong*, end, and *tanah*, land\u2014literally \"land's end\": it is the name applied to the lower part of the Malay Peninsula. Ujontana or Ujantana are the more common forms in the Portuguese accounts: thus de Barros (in A.D. 1552) writes, \"you must know that Ujantana is the most\n\nR.A.Soc., No. 60, 1911.\nsoutherly, and the most easterly point of the main land of the Malacca coast which from this point turns North in the direction of the Kingdom of Siam.\"\n\nGodinho de Eredia in his Declara\u00e7\u00e3o de Malacca e India Meridional invariably wrote it Ujontana, thus VJONTANA\u2014which Janssen, in his French translation has rendered throughout as Viontana. Pinto (A.D. 1614) has Jantana.\n\nMarsden in his \"History of Sumatra\" (p. 345) writes of the \"King of Oojong Tana (formerly of Bintang)\" and is obviously referring to the ruler of Johore.\n\n2. Panagim. The map in the M.S. shows this to be the Linggi River\u2014Godinho de Eredia also gives the northern and southern boundaries of Malacca as the Panagim and the Muar Rivers.\n\n3. \"Married Whites.\" The Portuguese \"married man\" formed a distinct class in Portuguese. There was the governing class, whose duty it was to administer the settlement, the military class whose duty it was to defend it, and the \"married man\" whose duty\u2014like that of the colonists of early Greece, it was to populate it. The Malacca Portuguese of the present day are the descendents of the married men. Godinho de Eredia says \"in the interior of this fortress there are, exclusive of the garrison, three hundred married men with their families.\"\n\n4. Straw huts: in other words, atap houses.\n\n5. Poisoned weapons were used with considerable success in the defence of Malacca against Albuquerque. The Commentaries after referring to the \"blowing tubes with poisoned arrows\" (which nowadays are used only by the aborigines) say:\n\n\"Of the men struck by the poisoned arrows on the first day, none escaped but one Fernao Gomez de Lemso, who was burned with a red hot iron directly he was struck so that ultimately God spared his life.\"\n\nPoisoned chevaux de frise\u2014the Malay ranjaus, sharpened stakes stuck point upwards in the ground, are referred to in Albuquerque's account of the fighting on the second day of the defence of Malacca.\n\n6. Candy. A weight used in South India: it varies (as do all weights and measures) in different places, but may be put at 500 pounds. Yule and Burnell's Glossary contains the following:\n\n\"The word is Mahratta Khundi, written in Tamil and Malayalam Kandi. The Portuguese write it Candil.\"\n\nAmong the passages quoted in the Glossary is this one from van Linschoten (A.D. 1598): \"candil is little more or less than 14 bushels wherewith they measure Rice, Corn, and all grain.\"\n\nWhitaker's Almanack gives among the Indian weights:\u20141 candy = 500 lb.\n\n7. Johore. (Although the \"papers upon Malay subjects\" published by direction of the Federated Malay States Government have adopted the spelling\u2014Johor, I venture to take this opportunity\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nof recording that instructions for the adoption of the spelling\u2014Johore\u2014were issued by the Government of the Straits Settlements in Government Gazette Notification No 377 of 1899.) Pahang. Pam is the form in which the name is most commonly found. Purchas in His Pilgrimes has variations Paam and Pan.\n\nA throwing spear. It would appear that the Portuguese found this word in use in South Africa, and applied it generally throughout the east. (Yule gives its derivation as the Berber word zagghaya with the Arabic article prefixed, and adds an interesting list of quotations of its use by early travellers). Godinho de Eredia in his account of the \"army\" of Malacca also writes of the assegay.\n\nThe author's equivalent \"darts of fire-hardened wood\" is correct. The word is Malay\u2014seligi. Malay boys generally make the head of a seligi of bamboo, out to a razor-edge in the shape of a spearhead, and use it for spearing pelandok and napu. In the days when the Malacca Malays used poisoned weapons, a seligi was of course as dangerous as any spear.\n\nBoth in Malay and in Javanese, the bow is called panah, and the arrow the \"bow's child\". The use of these weapons, which is unknown to the Malays of the Southern end of the Peninsula, would appear to have been borrowed from the people who thronged there in the days, immediately before its capture by Albuquerque, when it was the meeting place of the trade of the Indian and the Pacific Oceans.\n\nThe sumpitan (sumpit\u2014to blow) is the tube, and not the dart which is known as the \"anak sumpitan.\" It is still the principal weapon of the aborigines.\n\nGodinho de Eredia writes thus of the climate of Malacca:\n\n\"The air in this region of Malacca is very fresh and very healthy; the opposite of what had been thought by the ancients, notably Aristotle and Ptolemeus who affirm that the part of the world between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn is very hot and burning, and that the atmosphere there is torrid. This land of Ujontana is truly the freshest and the most agreeable in the world. The air there is healthy and vivifying; well suited for keeping the human body in good health, being at the same time hot and moist. Neither the heat nor the humidity are however excessive: for the heat is tempered by, and counteracts the humidity which results from the rains which in this region are frequent throughout the year, especially at the changes of the monsoon.\"\n\nThis description, doubtless, savours of hyperbole, but as the early Chinese travellers condemned the climate of Malacca as \"unwholesome,\" and as this condemnation is repeated in Whiteway's \"Rise of the Portuguese Power in India\" (page 5) it is well to record a more favourable opinion.\n\nThe Batu Pahat river was known to the Portuguese as Rio Fermozo. (Crawfurd's Descriptive Dictionary: Article Malacca). Captain\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 60, 1911.\nSherard Osborn in a map of the Malay Peninsula in his book \"Quedah\" (A.D. 1838) shows a Mount Formosa south of Malacca. A Formosa bank is shewn at the mouth of the Batu Pahat river in this Society's map of the Peninsula dated 1898.\n\nThe boundaries are given in their proper order: North, East and South. \"The land of the Menangcabos\" (i.e. Menangkabau men) is Rembau, one of the Negri Sembilan on the North. \"Rindo\" is the district washed by the Endau river, which flows into the sea on the East coast of the Peninsula, and forms the boundary between Johore and Pahang. Tamungam (i.e. Temenggong) is Johore.\n\nEndau. Vide supra.\n\nJohore was governed by a Temenggong subject to the Sultan of Dai, and Pahang was governed by a Bendahara also subject to the Sultan of Dai. The Malay expression is Baginda di Dai, Temenggong di Johore, Bendahara di Pahang.\n\nThis is the Portuguese form of the word we generally write as betel. The native name (Malayalam) for betel-leaf is vettila (the para or simple leaf).\n\nGarcia de Orta (Goa 1563) writes thus in his colloquies:\n\n\"We call it betre, because the first land known by the Portuguese was Malabar..............all the names that occur, which are not Portuguese are Malabar, like betre.\"\n\nTin is mentioned in a Chinese account of Malacca dated A.D. 1416. It is thus translated by Groeneveldt. (Miscellaneous Papers relating to Indo-China. Second Series Vol. I page 244.)\n\n\"Tin is found in two places of the mountains, and the king has appointed officers to control the mines. People are sent to wash it, and after it has been melted, it is cast into small blocks weighing one cati eight taels or one cati four taels official weight: ten pieces are bound together with rattan and form a small bundle, whilst forty pieces make a large bundle. In all their trading transactions they use these pieces of tin instead of money.\"\n\nA fuller account of the exorcitio of these tigers by the bishop is given by Gordinho de Fredia in a chapter of which a translation is given in the appendix.\n\nThe tigers of Malacca had long been famous. In the \"Ying-yai Sheng Lan\" (A.D. 1416) there is mention of a \"kind of tiger which assumes a human shape, comes into the town and goes among the people.\" The commentary gravely adds that \"when it recognized it is caught and killed.\" The Malay superstitious regarding were tigers are too well-known to require repetition here.\n\nA silver coin (formerly gold) now equivalent to 480 reis, or about two shillings of English money. It was worth much more relatively in the seventeenth century.\n\nA kind of galley much used by the Portuguese. It carried a number of fighting men.\nThere is the following mention of a jalea in the Storia do Mogor (Vol. I page 370.)\n\n\"The king of Arakan.....................sent him back to his father with a number of boats called jalias, which are small galleys commanded by Portuguese subjects of the said King.\" The word is connected with \"galley\" and with \"jolly-boat:\" see the very interesting article \"Gallevat\" in Yule and Burnell.\n\nPenang. Lancaster's visit in the \"Edward Bonaventure\" in 1592 is, I believe, the first recorded landing in Penang, but the present account would make it appear probable that the Portuguese scouting galleys called at the island before his time. May is the month in which the South-West monsoon sets in, bringing the sailing boats from India. In December the North-East monsoon, which brings the Chinese trade down to Singapore, is in full force.\n\nJunk-Ceylon. The corruption of Ujong Salang, (see article Junk-Ceylon in Yule and Burnell) It is now better known as Tongkah. In September or October, the fair weather, along the West coast of the Peninsula, begins with the breaking of the North-East monsoon.\n\nI do not know this word. In the connection in which it is used it does not appear to have anything to do with 'bahar' or 'bhara.'\n\nAn alquerie is said by Vieyra (quoted in Albuquerque (Hakluyt) Vol. IV, page 88) to be the equivalent of \"one peck, three quarts and one pint of English measure.\"\n\nGodinho de Eredia describes a bantim as being a kind of skiff, a smaller vessel than a jalea, carrying oars and masts, and rudders on both sides, and as being used for sea-fights. Wilkinson's Dictionary gives banting as a native sailing boat with two masts. Crawfurd leaves it as \"a kind of boat.\" Van Eysinga in his Malay-Dutch dictionary has bantieng, soort van boot met twee masten.\n\nNo book of reference, to which I have access, gives this word.\n\nConcretions found in the stomachs of certain animals and supposed to have marvellous antidotal virtues. The Portuguese generally called them pedra di porco, but in Borneo they are, I believe, most often found in a species of monkey, and in Pahang in porcupines. Pahang is still famed for its porcupines' bezoar stones.\n\nThe reference would tend to show that the bezoar stones referred to immediately above were probably those of porcupines.\n\nEagle-wood, or kayu gharu: see the article eagle-wood in Yule and Burnell.\n\nSappan-wood or Brazil-wood. See both articles in Yule and Burnell.\n\nPatani was from its position on the east coast of the peninsula a very important trading centre, and when the East India Company issued instructions to its agent in the east in 1614 (circa)\n[vide an article in Journal No 54.] it selected, as the four principal stations, Surat on the west coast of India, Coromandel on the east coast of India, Bantam in Java, and Patani in the Malay Peninsula. \"The command of him at Patani was to stretch over Siam, Cambodia, Cochin-China, Japan and Borneo; and the places thereabouts.\"\n\n34. Patacas. Water-melons: see the article pataca in Yule and Burnell.\n\n35. Queen of Patani. There are very interesting accounts of the queen of Patani and of the custom of the country in the \"Calendar of State Papers, Colonial Series, East Indies, China and Japan\" Volume I.\n\n36. Baloons. Godinho de Eredia has the following account:\u2014\n\n\"The vessels used by the inhabitants of Ujontona are not great. They have balos, vessels used for freight, with oars and carrying sails like those of a frigate. The body of the boat is of hard wood, and the frame is made of branches of the nypeira palm and of canes laced together to keep out the water. They have one or two masts, and the ropes are made of rattans. The sails are made of a kind of palm known as Pongo. At the stern are two rudders one on each side.\"\n\nDe la Loubere (Historical Relation of the Kingdom of Siam A.D. 1888) gives a long account of the \"balous\" of Siam, (page 41) and has four engravings of highly ornamental and elaborately carved barges, with lofty poops and bows, used by the king and by high officials on state occasions. I venture to think that the derivation which Yule and Burnell suggest for this word in their article \"Baloon\" is incorrect, and that the probable derivation is from the word ballam, or vallam, used for dug-out canoes in Ceylon. See Emerson Tennant's Ceylon Vol. II Page 549.\n\n37. Camudes. The Malay word kamudi, a rudder.\n\n38. Panchelloi. I do not know this word.\n\n39. Manchua. Manji is the Malayalam word for a large cargo boat with a single mast and a square sail much used on the Malabar coast. The Portuguese made manchua out of the word.\n\n40. Angely. Perhaps another form of the word agila, i.e., eagle wood\u2014vide Note 31 supra.\n\n41. Benzoin. Or benjamin: kemennyen; the resin of the styrasa benzoin: for a derivation of the word, and an account of the resin, see the article in Yule and Burnell. See also the article in Crawfurd.\n\n42. Almond Milk. I do not know what this may be.\n\n43. Lac. The resinous incrustation produced on certain trees by their puncture by the lac insect [coccus lacca.] For an interesting account of this resin, and of stick-lac, seed-lac, and lacquer, see the article lac in Yule and Burnell.\n\n44. Calambac. Eagle-wood\u2014See the article Calambac in Crawfurd.\n\n45. Pahang Gold. The \"gold mountains\" of Pahang, i.e., the land in Ulu Pahang, are mentioned in the history of the ming dynasty. (Vide Groeneveldt p. 256.)\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe two rivers are probably the Rompin on the South, and the Kuantan on the North.\n\nPulau Tioman, off the Pahang Coast. It belongs to the State of Pahang.\n\nPelandok; the mouse-deer, or chevrotain (*tragulus javanicus*).\n\nPlantains or bananas (*musa paradisaica*) \"the fig of Paradise\" or sometimes \"the apple of Paradise.\" The Portuguese always called the plantain \"the Indian fig,\" and in the West Indies the common small variety of plantain is still called a fig.\n\ni.e., damar.\n\nJohore was repeatedly ravaged by the Acheines during their successive attacks upon Malacca, of which the last took place in A.D. 1628, when the Acheine fleet was practically annihilated in Malacca harbour by the Portuguese.\n\nAn insight into the meaning of de Resende's grim expression that Johore was \"once again becoming inhabited\" is afforded in Marsden's History of Sumatra (p. 364) where there is the following passage regarding the King of Acheen.\n\n\"The disposition of this monarch was cruel and sanguinary...........\n\nThe whole territory of Acheen was almost depopulated by wars, executions and oppression. The King endeavoured to repeople the country by his conquests. Having ravaged the Kingdoms of Johor, Paham, Queda, Pera and Delhy, he transported the inhabitants from those places to Acheen to the number of twenty two thousand persons. But this barbarous policy did not produce the effect he hoped; for the unhappy people being brought naked to his dominions and not allowed any kind of maintenance on their arrival, died of hunger in the streets.\"\n\nIndragiri.\n\nSiak.\n\nI am afraid that I cannot follow this account. The Siak river empties itself into the Straits opposite Bencalis Island. It is difficult to understand what the other river is (unless it is the Kampar) and what island Sabam is.\n\nThe terubok fish: *clupea kanaquarta*. This excellent fish, which is like a herring in taste, is common on the Kedah coast, but practically unknown in the Penang market. The dried roes are however commonly used throughout the Straits as a *sambal* with curry. For a full account of the fish and of the industry connected with its capture, see Crawfurd (article Trubo) where several references to early travellers are given.\n\nI cannot identify this river.\n\nThese are the celebrated \"orang laut,\" or \"Sea-Sakis\" of the Malay Peninsula, of whom the boys that dive off the mail steamers at Tanjong Pagar are the descendants. A few still survive at Jugra, in Selangor, and in places along the Pahang coast. There are considerable numbers of them along the coast near, and north of Tongkah.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 60, 1911.\nGodinho de Eredia gives this account of them: \"Before the founding of the town of Malacca, the place was inhabited by Saletes, a race of fishermen, who settled themselves under the shade of the Malacca trees there. They used pointed javelins called Saligi and pursued fishes with such address that they could transfix fishes in the depths of the sea, and they used no other weapon. They were a wild, cannibal race.\"\n\nMost of the early travellers have interesting accounts of this extraordinary people. See the article \"orang-laut\" in Crawfurd. Saletes is the Portuguese name for these people. It is a corruption of \"orang selat,\" selat being a Strait, and used then, as now, with particular reference to the Straits of Singapore.\n\n58. Quintal. In the Metric system, a quintal (or cental) is one hundred kilograms, and according to Whitaker's Almanack the equivalent of 1.968 cwt. In old tables of weights and measures, a quintal, or cental, Avoirdupois, is shewn as being a hundred pounds.\n\nThe following is a table of weights:\n\n| Quintal | = | Arrabas |\n|---------|---|---------|\n| 1       |   | 4       |\n| Arrabo  | = | Arratels|\n| 1       |   | 32      |\n| Arratel | = | Marcos  |\n| 1       |   | 2       |\n| Marco   | = | Oncas   |\n|         |   | 8       |\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nA translation of Chapters I. and XV. of Gardinho de Eredia's \"Declaracam de Malaca.\"\n\nRegarding the City of Malacca.\n\nMalacca is a word which means Mirobolan or Monbain, the fruit of a tree which grows on the banks of the Aerlele, (Ayer Leleh), a stream which flows from the slopes of Bukit China to the sea, on the coast of Ujontana. It was on the banks of this stream, on the South East side, that Permicuri, the first monarch of the Malays, founded the town of Malacca, which to-day is so well-known throughout the world.\n\nIt is situated in 2\u00b0 12' of north latitude, in the torrid zone; and the longest day consists of 12 hours 6 minutes. Ptolemy makes no mention of Malacca, which is modern and was given to it by the monarch above mentioned, who founded the town, in the year 1411, in the time of Pope John XXIV. when King John II. reigned in Castille and King John I. in Portugal.\n\nBefore the founding of Malacca, the Saletes, a tribe of fishermen, congregated in this place, in the shade of the trees which bear the mirobolans. These fishermen used pointed javelins called \"soliques,\" i.e. seligi, and threw them with such skill that they could transfix fishes at the bottom of the sea. They employed no other implements of fishing. They were inhabitants of the coast of Ujontana, in the southern sea, and a wild and cannibal race.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nAn old and very narrow isthmus started from the point of Tanjon-Tuan, now called Caborachado (Cape Rachado) and crossed to meet another point called Tanjon-Balvala, on the coast of Samatta, or, by corruption, Samattra (Sumatra).\n\nIt was by this isthmus, which extended between two seas, one lying on the North and the other on the South, that the natives from the main land of Ujontana crossed over to Samatta.\n\nThis name of Samatta means Peninsula, or Chersonese; and it is this peninsula that Ptolemy mentions under the name of the Golden Chersonese. We shall have occasion to return to this further on.\n\nPermicuri chose this place because he considered it capable of being placed in a state of defence. This monarch had to protect himself from the ruler of Pam (Pahang), a territory in the interior of Ujontana.\n\nThis ruler made occasional armed attacks upon Permicuri, for he sought vengeance for an act of treachery, of which Permicuri had been guilty towards a relative of his, the \"Xabandes\" (Shahbandar) of Singapore, whom Permicuri had assassinated in spite of the proofs of friendship he had received from him; at the time when Permicuri pursued by his father-in-law, the old Emperor of Java, had sought a refuge in Singapore.\n\nPermicuri therefore fortified himself on the crest of the hill, in a strong position where he was free from the fear of being taken by his enemy. He evinced great energy and zeal in enlarging his territory, which he extended beyond the river Aerlele; and he developed his new State by encouraging commerce and traffic with the surrounding tribes, who all came to Malacca to fish for the \"Saveis\", a kind of shad, whose eggs placed in brine formed a much sought-after dish. Later, when the port had become frequented, the merchants of Coromandel, chiefly the Chelis (Chulia i.e. Kling) came over with stuffs and clothing; and they thus attracted thither the inhabitants of the surrounding islands, who helped to populate and to bring custom to the port, by bringing merchandise and exchanging their gold and spices for the stuffs of Coromandel.\n\nThis is the origin of the wealth of Malacca, which became one of the richest and most opulent States in the world. At this period the natives were possessed of much ingot gold, and the prosperity of the country continued under the reign of Permicuri's successors who were Xaquemdarxa, (Iskandar Shah) the Sultan Medafarxa, the Sultan Marsusel, the Sultan Alaudim (Ala-ed-Din) and lastly the Sultan Mohameth (Mahmud) who was conquered by Afonso d'Albuquerque, who captured the whole country, a little more than a hundred years after its foundation, on the 15th of August, 1511.\n\nAfter conquering Malacca, the invincible Captain constructed a stone fortress at the foot of the hill on the sea-shore, to the South-East of the mouth of the river, where the Sultan Mohameth had built the palaces where he had kept the treasures with which he\nescaped after crossing the river, and taking refuge in the interior of the country. Mohameth, after passing through the country of Pam, intrenched himself at Bentam, whence he proposed to make expeditions against Malacca. But Albuquerque had by this time finished the work of fortification of this town; his commanding position, his artillery and his powerful garrison made him the terror of the Malays and always maintained the authority and honour of the Crown of Portugal. Malacca was victorious in repelling numerous attacks by Malay Kings and other neighbouring rulers.\n\nThe fortress forms a square each side of which measures 20 yards, it is 80 yards high (sic), and is protected on the east by walls built of stone and plaster; and in the interior there is a spring of water. In time of war or disturbance the inhabitants can be given shelter and provision there. The castle, or the tower, is as high as the hills. It was not built on the hill because it was preferable to place it lower down, in the sea itself, to ensure re-victualling in case of war. When this had been done, wooden walls were erected around the groups of Malay dwellings.\n\nTwo walls, built of stone covered with plaster, started from the angle formed by the sea to the west in two lines; they followed the shore and turned at right angles when they reached the height of the ground where the hospitals and the Brotherhood of Mercy were built; and thence the two lines turned, the one to the North for a distance of 260 yards as far as the angle of the rampart of St. Peter, at the mouth of the river opposite the castle, and the other to the East for a distance of 150 yards at the turn of the coast by the gate and rampart of St. James. Another wall, which was built at the same time, extended from the rampart of St. Peter as far as the gateway of the Alfandega, and thence, for a distance of 300 yards, followed the river to the North East as far as the acute angle formed by the rampart of St. Dominic. From the gateway here, a wooden wall extended to the South East, for a distance of 200 yards, to the obtuse angle at the end of the Avenue of the Mother of God. Another wooden wall extended from the gateway of St. Anthony for a distance of 200 yards towards the South East beyond the rampart of the Virgins as far as another gateway on the rampart St. James. The total length of the walls was thus 1310 yards of five palms to the yard. In later days the architect in chief, Joao Baptista, by order of the King, prepared amended plans of the fortress. He made a new and enlarged plan of the walls in the South and in the waste land which stretches from the rampart of St. James to that of St. Dominic. His idea was to build new walls of stone and plaster instead of the wooden palisades, but his project was never carried out. Although there were four gateways pierced in the walls, two only, that of the Alfandega and that of St. Anthony, were generally used, and were open for ordinary traffic. In the interior of the enclosed area are the Castle, the Governor's Palace, the Bishop's Palace, the State Council Hall, the Hall of the Brotherhood of Mercy, five Chur-\nches\u2014our Lady of the Assumption, the Cathedral with the chapter and episcopal throne, our Lady of the Visitation and of Mercy, our Lady of the Annunciation (in the College of the Company of Jesus, at the very crest of the hill), the Church of St. Dominic in the Convent of the Dominicans and the Church of St. Anthony in the Convent St. Augustine\u2014and two hospitals.\n\nOutside the walls are three suburbs, the first is that of Upe (Upah) on the other side of the river; the second is that of Yler (Hilir) on Tanjonpacer (Tanjong Pasir) on this side of the river; the third, that of Sabba, lies along the bank of the river. Of these three, the principal one is Upe. It is also called the \"Tranqueira\" or the \"Palisade,\" because of the palisade, or wooden wall, which has been built there parallel with the bank. It is 1400 yards from the mouth of the river. From its extremity a wooden wall extends 120 yards to the East towards the gate of the palisade as far as the \"Wooden Cavalier.\" Thence, following an obtuse angle, another wooden wall stretches across the marshy and muddy ground of the interior, as far as the gate of Campon China which touches the river. In this way, the suburb of Upe, with its country houses and gardens, is well protected from the attacks of the \"Saletes.\" Nevertheless, when preparations are being made for war, this suburb is entirely depopulated and dismantled, its whole population taking refuge in the castle within the walls.\n\nThis suburb is divided into two parishes; St. Thomas and St. Stephen. The parish of St. Thomas is called Campon Chelim (Kampong Kling); it stretches along the bank of the river, from the Javanese Bazaar towards the North West and ends at the stone rampart. In this part live the Chelis of Coromandel who must be the \"Chalinges\" of which Pliny writes in Chapter XVII. of Book VI.\n\nThe other parish, St. Stephen, is called Campon China and stretches from the strand of the Javanese Bazaar, for a distance of 800 yards, along the river side to the wooden wall of the palisade at the mouth of the river, and extends, beyond the swampy part of the river, to the plantations of Nypeiras (Nipahs) and of \"Brava\" palms which grow beside on the brook called \"Parit China.\" In this part of Campon China live the \"Chincheos\" descendants of the \"Tocharos\" of Pliny, foreign merchants and natives occupied in fishing. The two parishes of St. Thomas and St. Stephen contain 2500 Christians, men, women, and children, beside the other heathen inhabitants. The houses are all built of timber and are covered with tiles to preserve them from the risk of fire. Stone buildings are, for reasons of defence in case of war, not allowed. At the mouth of the river, on the terrace of the Alfandega, there is a stone bridge on which a sentry mounts guard at night. On the bank, at the place called the Javanese Bazaar, at the entrance to the river, are sold the victuals, rice and grain which the Javanese merchants bring daily in their sailing boats.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 60, 1911.\nThe second suburb, that of Yler, is situated on the other side of the river towards the South East, and through it wooden huts covered with thatch (atap) extend for a distance of 1200 yards from the river Aerlele towards the fields of Tanjonpacer, when there is a \"banjacal\" or guard-house which is its only defence. In this suburb there is a parish Church dedicated to our Lady of Pity, which serves a parish of 1300 Christians, without counting the heathen.\n\nFrom the Aerlele river, or stream, another row of wooden dwellings stretches eastward for 1000 yards as far as the well of Bukit China, which supplies excellent water springing from the foot of the hill, on whose summit rises the Church of the Mother of God and the Convent of the Capuchins of St. Francisco.\n\nFurther to the North there is another hill called Bukit Piatto, and all round there are fields and swamps as far as Bukit Pipi, and Tanjonpacer to the South East and South.\n\nThe last suburb, that of Suppa, extends from the moat of the rampart St. Dominic. Its houses are made of wood and built on piles, right in the middle of the water. This ground, being swampy and damp, is well suited to the calling of the fishermen who live in this suburb; they tie up their boats and fishing nets alongside their houses, and float in the water the timber and forest produce of the interior of the country in which they deal. In this suburb is the parish Church of St. Laurence which serves a population of 1400 Christians and other very numerous natives who live in the swampy ground where the \"Nypeiras\" or \"Brava\" palms, from which they distil the nypa wine, grow. Besides these three parishes extra muros there are three parishes in the interior of the country; St. Lazarus, Our Lady of Guadeloupe, and Our Lady of Hope. They are situated on the bank of the river and contain a population of 2200 Christians and heathen natives or vassals who live inland in farms where they raise cattle and farmyard animals. In the eight parishes alone in the jurisdiction of Malacca the Christian population reaches 7400 souls, without counting the heathen and the vassal natives.\n\nThe State is administrated by a Governor elected for three years, by a bishop and by other dignitaries of the episcopal see assisted by City Magistrates organised in the same manner as the Tribunal of Evora of the Fathers of Mercy, and by royal delegates for the financial and judicial departments.\n\nThe State further supports mendicant orders, a Convent of the Company of Jesus with its schools and colleges, the convents of the order of St. Dominic and of St. Augustine, capuchin monks of St. Francis, and ministers of the Christian religion. Inside the fortress live, besides the garrison for its defence, 300 married Portuguese with their families. There are in all four religious houses, eight parishes, fourteen churches, two chapels of the Hospitalers, and some hermitages and oratories.\nRegarding Gunoledam (Gunong Ledang, or Mount Ophir.)\n\nThe mountain of Gunoledam, like Mount Atlas, where sybiline caves are found, is a high mountain. It is half a league in height, and a little more than a league in circumference at its base: it is quite isolated. If one believes a story, which is widely spread among the Malays, the queen Putry, the companion of Permicuri, who founded Malacca, retired to this mountain, and, by enchantment (for by magic she became immortal) lives there still. Her home is on the heights of the mountain in a cave, where she lies on a raised bed which is decorated with the bones of dead men. She is clad in silk and gold, and looks like a lovely young girl. Round this cave are planted thick rows of bamboos, in which one hears harmonious voices and sounds of music. It is something like this that Marco Polo describes when he writes in the 44th chapter of this first book of the music of dulcimers which was heard in the desert of Job.\n\nAt a certain distance from the cave and the bamboos are groves of fruit trees full of delicate fruit and singing birds, and not far from them are the forests where roam the tigers who guard this enchanted Putry, this new Circe of Thessaly.\n\nThis story is probably not true, but the natives firmly believe in it. They further assert that on this mountain is a cave like that of the Pythians and the Sibyls, and that the forest-dwelling Benuas here learn their magic arts and hold intercourse with the devil. Here, without seeing any one, they hear mysterious voices which reveal to them not only the qualities of plants and of miraculous and medicinal herbs, but the art of preparing medicines, both beneficial and harmful. In order to get this information, the Benuas employ a herb called Erba vilca, which is found on Gunoledam as well as in America. By drinking a decoction of this herb, they put themselves in communication with the devil or with Putry, who like the Thessalian witch Erichto, and like the enchantress Circe, takes the form of animals and hides.\n\nThese forest-dwelling Benuas in the same manner, and by means of the same practices and words would take the forms of tigers, lizards, crocodiles or other animals. They then had supernatural power, and could hold conversation with people in remote places, like the sorceress of Tuscany, who could show to those who consulted her things that were happening at a distance.\n\nWhile speaking of this subject, I ought to make mention of the first bishop of Malacca, Dom Georges de Santa Lucia, whose merits should be always exalted. He wished to put an end to the harm caused to the country by these forest-dwelling Benuas, who in the shape of tigers used to enter the town of Malacca, and kill unresisting women and children.\n\nHe wished to excommunicate them and had public prayers made in the cathedral. Then, at issue of the Grand Mass and after the procession of the feast of the assumption of our lady, the pro-\ntectress of the fortress, he solemnly excommunicated these tigers. Since then they have never entered a village, nor killed a man, woman or child. For this Christians gave thanks to God. This miracle astounded the natives and as a result, many of them and many Cheli (Kling) idolaters were converted in 1560.\nSingapore old Straits and New Harbour.\n\nBY WARREN D. BARNES.\n\nIt has long been a tradition that the old straits of Singapore were the Selat Tebrau between the Island and the Johore mainland and a new tradition is now springing up that the passage through New or Keppel Harbour was discovered by the late Admiral Keppel. The object of this paper is to show that both these traditions are without foundation of fact and that the old Straits of Singapore are none other than the present Keppel Harbour.\n\nIt is unnecessary to point out in detail how ill-adapted are the Johore straits for sailing vessels making a passage; the western entrance is by no means easy, the distance is long and ships using the channel would be exposed to strong tides, be liable to be becalmed and, most important of all, be at the mercy of the pirates who haunted these waters for centuries. On the other hand the passage through the New Harbour is short and not particularly difficult. If it had not been used in former times some explanation of so singular a fact would have to be found.\n\nThe most convenient way of examining the question will be to deal in chronological order with the principal historical references to these Straits.\n\nA. D. 1436.\n\nHsing-ch'a Sheng-lan\n\n(W. P. Groeneveldt, Notes on Malay Archipelago and Malacca in Essays relating to Indo-China, Second Series Vol: I. page 203).\n\nThe strait of Lingga is situated to the North-west of Palembang (San-bo-tsa\u00ef), high mountains face each other as the teeth of a dragon and between these the ships pass.\n\n(Earlier than 15th century)\n\nCharts from Wu-pei-pi-shu with sailing directions (The Seaports of India and Ceylon by George Phillips) China Branch R.

The passage in question cannot be the Straits of Ling-\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 60. 1911,\nga which lie much too far away for the second quotation and I suggest that it is the New Harbour. The western entrance to this harbour has been altered since old times, as is evident from the quotation below from \"Prisoners their own Warders.\" I suggest that owing to the similarity of names the Chinese accounts confuse the island of Lingga with the dragon-teeth passage.\n\nA.D. 1598\n\nLinschoten. I translate from a French translation \"Le grand Routie de Mer,\" Amsterdam 1619 pp. 40-42.\n\nIn Chapter XX. Linschoten gives sailing-directions from Malacca to Macau. Having brought his mariner down to Pulau Pisang and Tanjong Bulus he says:\u2014\n\n\"At a league from this Cape is a river [Sungei Pulai] and a short league further another river [Selat Tebrau] with a large mouth in which lies a little island called Sincapura [a mistake for Merambong] where the bottom is good and clean. This river empties itself at the port of Iantana [Ujong Tanah, Johore] the place where Antonio de Meno went once by mistake with a ship of eight hundred 'casses,' each 'casse' being three and a half quintals Portuguese weight, and got out again. From this river the land trends to a point to the South and at this point begins the entrance to the first straits [Selat Sembilan] through which you must pass. On the North of this bay the land lies higher than on the South, where it is low and uneven, with a tree covered hill showing above its surroundings. This is the end of the land. For on the East you find islands and rocks stretching first to the South and then to the East in the form of a bay. From the above mentioned Cape of Tanjamburo [Tanjong Bulus] to the entrance to these straits the course is due East and the depth seven or eight fathoms.\n\n\"Any one wishing to sail to China by Sincapura [Singapore] should if he comes by Pulo Picon [Pulau Pisang] at the beginning of July keep close to the island of Carimon; for the Java monsoon which is on then always blows from the coast of Sumatra. Also if you keep on the Carimon side when you leave it you come right on to the entrance of the straits. The depths differ on this course and when you come from the Tanjong Bulus side the country at the entrance of the strait 'a l'apparence d'un trone' which is a certain sign of the said entrance. Here you should tack (tiendrez votre course en louvant) so as to make the entrance easier.\n\n\"These first straits [Selat Sembilan] have at their entrance two shoals [Basses] which come from the Cape one on each side. On the South side at the beginning of the straits is a long range of islands stretching to the East which forms the straits. To enter you must all the time keep closer to the South side than to the other. At first entrance you will find twelve ten and nine fathoms and when you have got so far in that the land to the South, that is the islands mentioned, are in...\"\none, you will see in front of you on the other side a cape with a little red hill. You will do well then to bear over a little to that side until you have passed the first island [Pulau Pesek] between which and the second [Pulau Ayer Limau] lies a shoal which can be seen sometimes at low water and which stretches half way across the channel; however you will be careful always to have the lead in your hands to know where you are. Having come close to this cape and hill bear off again to the right, for this is the only shoal between these islands, and in this way you will carry on to the East for about half a league with this same depth of eight or nine fathoms. Thence this range of Islands along which you are sailing trends to the South-east and immediately afterwards you will see a little further on to the right of these islands a round island stretching a little behind from one to another, [the French is not clear] you will carry on along this leaving it on your right. You will always have eight or ten fathoms with a muddy bottom. On the left hand, that is on the North side, the land has many bays among them a large one which trends to the South. On this South side is another round island which you will leave on the same side. You will beware of this North side as it is full of shoals and will hold on your course on the other or right hand side. When you come close to the above mentioned small round island on the right hand side you will see straight in front of you, that is to say, at the end of the range of islands along which you are coasting, another small low island with a few trees and a shore of white sand [? Cyrene shoal]; this is directly opposite the East and West straits of Singapore. You will bear down on this island and when you come close to it you will see the straits, towards which you will steer keeping off a little both to avoid the shoals and reefs to the North and also so as not to be carried by the tide to the South side of the entrance of the straits. On the North is a sandy beach [Pasir Panjang] about a cannon-shot long having a kind of bay at the end of it where fresh water can be got. The whole way along this beach you will find a good bottom fit for anchoring if necessary. Coming up to the beach you will find currents which will carry you down to the entrance of the straits but you can avoid them by keeping off. You will do well also not to pass the end of these straits on the North side as there are reefs and banks there.\n\n\"The entrance of the straits is about a stone's throw across between two high mountains and runs a cannon-shot length to the East. The least depth in the straits is four and a half fathoms. At the entrance at the foot of the Northern mountain is a rock which looks like a pillar. It is commonly known as Varella del China [Lot's wife]. A little further on in the straits and on the South side is a bay in the middle of which is another rock below water and a shoal with reaches from this\nrock to the middle of the channel. About an arquebus-shot further on, on the same South side, is a passage reaching to the sea on the other side thus making an Island [Selat Singkeh]. It is too shallow for any but small craft (petites fustes) to use. In the middle of the bay opposite the opening of this passage is a rock or rocky shoal two fathoms under water which reaches a little out of the bay to the middle of the channel. When you are up to this bay you see a straight hill which forms a cape at the end of the straits. Having doubled this cape you see a red hill near which the bottom is good and clean, after which the land trends to the South-east.\n\nOn the North side of the straits there are in all three bays, of which the first two are small and the third, which lies opposite the cape of the red hill at the end of the straits, large. This third bay has a bank of rock which is uncovered at low water and reaches from headland to headland; care must be taken of it. Everything on the North side outside this bay is throughout the channel clean and good from one headland to the other.\n\nAt the exit from the passage are two reefs, one of which is opposite to the mouth of it about a cannon-shot away (a la port\u00e9e d'une pi\u00e8ce de fer) running North and South; the other is to the South of the mouth and a short cannon-shot away (a la port\u00e9e d'un canon mediocre) stretching to the East so that the two make a cross; both can be seen at low water. The channel between them has barely four fathoms with a muddy bottom; outside the channel the bottom is sand whereby many ships have come in danger of shipwreck. If therefore you have to go that way take care when leaving the channel not to steer due East, and if you wish to anchor bear to the South, for if you stop in the current of the straits you may lose an anchor or two through the violence of the ship's motion.\n\nWhen clear of the straits bear to your right along the land but not coming closer to it than a depth of four fathoms, and when you have passed the first beach, together with a hill and a rock at the end of it, and a bay which lies opposite the hill, and have reached half way to another hill, which is at the other end of the above mentioned passage from the straits, you should then shape your course to the East, not coming within four fathoms on either side for fear of falling on banks and shoals. The bottom of the channel is muddy. You must always have the lead in your hand until you have got a greater depth, which you will soon do. It is safest to use a small boat to sound the channel. When you have reached twelve or fifteen fathoms beware of the South side until you are a league to the East of the Straits, for from fifteen fathoms you would get ten and then would find yourself on some shoal, for there are many shoals and sand banks just there.\n\nThese Straits (of Rumenia) have six small Islands [Pulan Lima] on each side of Tantana [Johor] which is on the North\nof it and along which the course is East and West (the French is not clear). They are about eight leagues distant [from the Singapore Strait]. You will beware of passing between two of them. The sea near here, that is for half a league to the South, is quite clear and fair with a sandy bottom in fifteen fathoms. Half way between the Straits [of Singapore] and the said Islands is the river of Iantana which has a very wide mouth, the entrance to which lies on the East side where large vessels often enter. On the West side, where there is a hill of red earth [Tanah Merah on Singapore Island] just beyond the mouth of the river, is a sandbank which stretches to sea for a league and a half and has been touched by many ships, you should beware of it. At the end of the said islands a reef [Rumenia shoals and North Patch] stretches for a full two leagues to sea East-North-East over which in fair weather only a little foam can be seen but where a heavy sea breaks in rough weather.\n\nBetween this reef and the islands is a large channel with a rocky bottom; the greatest [?]smallest depth which I have found is five and a half fathoms, from that seven and a half and again six and eight and a half are found. The width of the channel is a good cannon-shot across. If you wish to use this channel you must turn off your course half a league from the islands without coming closer to them for fear of coming on the banks as happened to Francisco Dagner who nearly lost his ship. Two leagues to the South-East of these islands is another small island which is a reef or rock of white stone and hence called Pedra Branca [Pedra Branca and Horsburgh Light] and near and to the South of it are other rocks and reefs. To the South also lies the island of Binton\u201d [Bintang].\n\nIn the above translation the remarks in square brackets are my own. These sailing directions are wonderfully clear seeing that they are a translation from the French of a translation from the Dutch of a translation from the Portuguese and there can be no doubt that the route which Linschoten taught to his fellow country-men lay through the S\u00e9l\u00e1t Sembilan and Keppel Harbour. It may be of value to note that Linschoten never visited the Further East; he arrived in India in 1583 and left it in 1589; his account of the passage from Malacea to Macau must therefore have been drawn from Portuguese sources and it is evident that some of the Portuguese pilots had a competent knowledge of their profession.\n\nA. D. 1599.\n\nViaggi di Carletti vol. ii. 208-9 quoted in Yule\u2019s \u201cHobson-Jobson\u201d s. v. Singapore.\n\nIn this voyage nothing occurred worth relating......except that after passing the straits of Sincapura......between the mainland and a variety of islands......with so narrow a channel that from the ship you could jump ashore or touch the branches of the trees on either side, our vessel stuck on a shoal.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 60, 1911.\nThis is a very fair traveller's description of a passage through the narrows of New Harbour but it is not applicable to one round Singapore Island. That a traveller should not have appreciated that Singapore is not a part of the main-land needs no explanation. Linschoten regarded the Selat Tebrau as a river.\n\nA. D. 1604\n\nEmanuel Godinho de Eredia in his Declaracam de Malaca, written in 1613 and published with a French translation by M. Leon Janssen at Brussels in 1882, gives three sketch maps of the end of the Peninsula.\n\nThe one on page 61 is headed Discripsao Chorographica dos estreitos de Sincapura e Sattam Ano 1604, and gives the following places: Tanion buro (Tanjong Bulus) Pulo Cucob, Rio Pule (Sungei Pulai), Salat Tubro (Selat Tebrau), Pulo Ular, blacan mati (Blakang Mati), estreito novo (new straits), estreito velho (old straits), Xabandaria (on Singapore island probably near the mouth of the Singapore river, meaning Shabandar's i.e. Harbour Master's office), Tanjon Ru, Sune bodo (Sungai Bedoh), Tana mera (Tanah Merah), and Tanjon Rusa (at Changi). Additional names are given on the other sketches as follows:\u2014 Estreyto Sincapura (Singapore Straits in the same position as estreite velho above) Siquijam (Pulau Sakijang St: John's Island), Pedra Branca (Horsburgh light) Rido de Jor (Johore River), Cotabatu (Kota batu), Batusawar, and Ponta Romania.\n\nThe sketches clearly show that three passages were known:\u2014 the old and new straits and the Selat Tebrau and that the old strait was New Harbour and the new strait the present main straits. It should be noted that no place names are given near the last, whilst on the South of Singapore are noted the residence of the Malay official and the places where wood and water were obtainable. Valentyn (J. S. B., R. A. S. Vol: XV p. 134) says \"on the 5th of May (1606) two prahus of the king of Johor with the Shahbandar of Singapore Seri Raja Nagara reached our fleet,\" and it is interesting to note that in the Sejarah Malayu (page 250 Shellabear's Romanised edition 1910) we are told of the stout defence offered by the \"penglima raayat Raja Nagara batin Singapura,\" against attacks by Portuguese from Malacca. The presence of a Shahbandar implies visits by foreign ships and traders.\n\nA. D. 1615\n\nBocarro 428. Yule op: cit: s.v. 'Governor's Straits.'\n\n1615. The Governor sailed from Manilla in March of this year with ten galleons and two galleys......On arriving at the straits of Sincapur......and passing by a new strait which since has taken the name of Estreito do Governador, there his galleon grounded on the reef at the point of the strait and was a little grazed by the top of it.\n\nThe Governor came to grief in the present Singapore straits.\n\nA. D. 1700\n\nA new Account of the East Indies by Captain Alexander Hamilton... ...who spent his time there from 1688 to 1723......Edinburgh 1727.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nVol II. page 93\n\nJohore has the benefit of a fine deep large river which admits of two entrances into it. The smaller is from the westward called by the Europeans the Straits of Sincapure but by the Natives Salleta le Brew (Selat T\u00e9brau). It runs along the side of Sincapure Island for 5 or 6 leagues together and ends at the great river of Johore.\n\nVol II. page 123.\n\nUpon the East side of the great Carimon is the entrance of the straits of Drions [Durian] and between the small Carimon and Tanjong bellong [Tanjong Bulus] on the continent is the entrance of the Straits of Sincapure before mentioned and also into the Straits of Governadore, the largest and easiest passage into the China seas.\n\nThis is probably the 'locus classicus' whence the tradition that the Selat T\u00e9brau forms the old straits of Singapore was derived. It would seem that between 1600 and 1700 the passage through Keppel Harbour fell into such complete disuse by European vessels that its very existence was forgotten. It was probably convenient for those ships only which could be worked with sweeps or towed with reship's boats in case of lack of wind, and hence as the size of shipping increased it went out of fashion.\n\n1826\n\nSingapore Chronicle August 1826\n(quoted in Moor's Notices of the Indian Archipelago Singapore 1827, page 276)\n\nThese (remarks) are from the Notes of Captain Rous and the officers of H.M.S. Rainbow and may be relied on as correct. [After a recommendation to stand closer in shore from Formosa Point to Pulau Pisang than Horsburgh approves of, the passage continues.] On reaching Singapore straits if a vessel is unable to weather Barn Island with the wind to the Southward she should bear up for the passage through the Selat Sinki or New Harbour. This will be found safe and expeditious for vessels under 600 tons burden but for ships of a larger size it is narrow and confined. The entrance to the passage bears E.N.E. from Sultan Shoal and is bold on each side, the only danger being a two fathom bank on the South side. After clearing the narrows and opening Singapore Harbour steer along Trumba Trumbaya reef a cable's length off and when well to the Southward edge away for the anchorage.\n\nThe passage above described was effected with success by H.M.S. Rainbow, the first vessel that has ever come through intentionally. The 'William Parker,' a free trader passed through by mistake some time ago and it was generally considered a very dangerous experiment. The enterprise of Captain Rous has however established its practicability and these notes and observations which were taken with great care will render the passage easy and safe for navigators. In these operations we understand\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 60, 1911.\nthat Capt. Rous was ably assisted by Mr. Bernard, Agent of Lloyd's, who came in the Rainbow from Malacca and whose practical knowledge of the Straits and Islands made his suggestions and information highly useful in exploring this unfrequented track.\n\nIt will be noted that the name New Harbour was in use in 1826.\n\n1841.\n\n\"Horsburgh\" 5th edition vol: ii. 264.\n\nSingapore Strait called Governor Strait or New Strait by French and Portuguese.\n\nThe name Straits of Singapore was first applied to Keppel Harbour then (see Hamilton above) to the Selat Tebrau and lastly to the Straits now so called.\n\n1843-4\n\nVoyage of H.M.S. Samarang by Sir Edward Belcher, London 1848. Vol: II. page 186.\n\nUpon a cursory examination of the Chart of this Channel (constructed by Mr. Thompson in 1842) I observe that a safe and short channel would be available by night and day provided that a light were established on the hill above the Malay village. That a leading mark seen clear of the point of Blakan Mati would bring a steamer from the fairway fork (to either Channel) into the New Harbour by a direct course of twelve miles.\n\nIt will be noted that in 1842 Keppel Harbour had been surveyed.\n\n1848.\n\n\"Prisoners their own Warders,\" McNair and Bayliss, London 1899 page 66.\n\nIn the year 1848 we find that the Indian convicts were employed in blasting some considerable part of a mass of rock known to the Malays as Batu Belayer or \"stone to sail to\" and by Europeans as \"Lot's wife.\" It was a dangerous obstruction to navigation being situated on the Singapore side of the Western Entrance to the New Harbour. It is reported as known to old navigators, of these seas and was shown on old charts over two hundred years ago.\n\nThe Government evidently took in hand in this year the improvement of this channel, which they had caused to be surveyed by Mr. Thompson in 1842.\n\n1848.\n\nAn anecdotal History of old Times in Singapore. C. B. Buckley Singapore 1902. page 493.\n\nIt was in May 30th of this year (1848) that Capt. Keppel wrote in his diary on board the \"Maeander\":\n\n\"On pulling about in my gig among the numerous prettily-wooded islands on the Westward entrance to the Singapore River I was astonished to find deep water close to the shore with a safe passage for ships larger than the \"Maeander.\" Now\nthat steam is likely to come into use this ready-made harbour as a depot for coals would be invaluable. I had the position surveyed and sent it with my report to the Admiralty. As it was, a forge was landed and artificers employed under commodious shades all under the eyes of the officers on board.\"\n\nThese repairs on the Maeander were therefore the first repairs done in New Harbour...*so it was Keppel who first sailed through New Harbour* and Singaporeans often said that it should not have been called New Harbour, which meant nothing, but Keppel Harbour. This was eventually done on the 19th April 1900 when the old Admiral was on a visit to Singapore.\n\nA visit to the Indian Archipelago in H.M.S. Maeander Capt. the Hon. Henry Keppel, London 1853, page 16,\n\nWhile preparations were making [May-August 1848] for the establishment at Labuan the Maeander refitted in the snug and picturesque New Harbour which appears to have been overlooked in selecting the first points of settlement; the only objection to it as a harbour is the intricacy of the Eastern entrance; a difficulty which by the introduction of steam has become of little consequence. No place could be better adopted for a coal depot; and as a harbour for a man-of-war to refit it is most convenient. The forge can be landed, boats repaired and artificers employed under commodious sheds and all under the immediate eye of the officers on board. It has another great advantage over Singapore Roads, in the latter anchorage a ship's bottom becomes more foul than in any other I know of, perhaps from the near proximity to the bottom; this is not the case in New Harbour in which there is always a tide running. Although it has the appearance of being hot and confined, surrounded as it is by high land we did not find it so in reality; generally there is a current of air inside while the ships in the stagnant and crowded roads are becalmed.\n\nIt will be seen from the above quotations that the gallant Admiral made no claim to have been the first to sail through New Harbour. He doubtless knew of the number of ships which had used the passage and he does not even say that he used it himself on this occasion. In fact it appears probable that he did not.\n\nA.D. 1857.\n\nAnecdotal History of Singapore page 649.\n\nOn the 19th of March H.M.S. Raleigh Capt. Turner bearing the broad pennant of Commodore Keppel C.B., sailed into New Harbour... As the old admiral was in Singapore when this chapter was being written he was asked... if he remembered how it came about that he sailed the Raleigh into New Harbour instead of into the Roads. He said that it was because he had surveyed New Harbour while he was in the Maeander and had the same Master (navigating officer) with him in the Raleigh who had\n\n* The italics are mine.\nsurveyed it with him so he felt quite confident about it although others had been afraid to go in.\n\nThere can have been no difficulty in sailing into New Harbour in 1857 seeing that P. and O. offices there were opened in 1852 (Anecdotal History page 566).\n\nA.

Capt. Keppel, R.N. of H.M.S. Dido now Admiral of the Fleet Sir H. Keppel G.C.B., D.C.L.\n\nIt is hereby notified for public information that the New Harbour will in future be called and known by the name of Keppel Harbour Singapore.\n\nSingapore 19th April, 1900.\n\nKeppel Harbour is a good name and the late Admiral deserved all the honours conferred upon him, but the reasons given for bestowing this particular one are very unconvincing. Captain Keppel was here in the Dido in 1842-1844 but it was not till his next visit in the Maeander in 1848 that he discovered all that he himself ever claimed to have discovered namely that New Harbour was an excellent place wherein to lay a ship up to refit and afforded great natural advantages for a coaling station.\n\nThe tradition that the Johore straits are the old Singapore straits will probably never die, but the new legend that Admiral Keppel was the first person to take a good sized ship through Keppel Harbour has got so short a start that it should be possible to overtake it.\nAn old Royal Cemetery at Pekan in Pahang.\n\nBy Warren D. Barnes.\n\n(With three plates.)\n\nThe plates to this paper are from photographs of the \"Makam Chondong\" at Pekan which lies at no great distance from the Istana of His Highness the Tungku Besar. The name \"Makam Chondong\" should in strictness mean the graves with a leaning shrine over them and it is very probable that the graves were once roofed in and that the building over them fell into decay and became out of the perpendicular. No trace however of such a building is to be seen. The local explanation of the name is that the surrounding trees all \"chondong\" to the \"makam\" doing obeisance to it.\n\nThe graves are on a platform of earth about 50 feet square, three or four feet high, and surrounded by a shallow ditch. On one side is a large hollow from which the earth to make the mound was perhaps obtained. It appears probable that the sides of the platform were once vertical and faced with bricks. A number of these bricks are still to be seen; they are really flat tiles measuring ten inches by five by two and a half. All the graves are on the Northern side of the platform, the rest is unoccupied.\n\nHis Highness the Tungku Besar informs me that he has a distinct recollection of visiting this cemetery about twenty years ago and finding on one of the stones the name \"Mahmud\" in gold letters. His Highness says that he took particular care to turn the stone over with the inscription downwards. The inscription has however disappeared and an examination of the photographs will show that the names on all the stones have been chipped away, doubtless to obtain the gold used to make them.\n\nI am told that about twenty or thirty years ago a herd of wild elephants did a good deal of damage to the graves. Mr. J. B. Scrivenor the Federal Geologist to whom I submitted a fragment from one of the stones said that it was a fine grained sandstone of no particular interest.\n\nIt will be seen that two of the large graves are male and one female. To the west of them and only shown in the small scale photograph is a grave with two plain stones; it is probably a female grave. In the centre of the platform are the fragments of two large grave stones similar to those shown in the larger scale photographs. It is probably on one of these that the name Mahmud was found. Alongside them is an unimportant female grave. My suggestion that the most important person would be buried in\nthe centre was negatived by a native authority who objected that in that case the subsequent and less important persons buried here would have their feet on his head. Difficulties of this nature have not however troubled the present royal family whose graves at Kampong Marhom near Kuala Pahang have no particular order or arrangement.\n\nI believe that a careful examination of the undamaged portions of the stones might lead to the detection of other names. I however failed to read any and no one whom I consulted had been more successful.\n\nThe only other clue to the identity of the occupants of these graves is a tradition of doubtful value that in the large female grave is buried one Che Puan Layang who is herself nothing but a name. I could hear of no other traditions.\n\nIt is certain that Sultan Mahmud was one of the early rulers of Pahang. He is mentioned in the Sejarah Malayu, where it is said that the Sultan Mahmud who lost Malacca to the Portuguese married his daughter, and he is also mentioned in the Bustanuss-salatin' list of Pahang rajas as being the son of the first raja Sultan Muhammad Shah and himself the fifth ruler. His posthumous title is given as Marhom di-hilir, i.e., the late ruler downriver. If one of the graves is really his, its date would be about the beginning of the 16th century.\n\nThere are at least two other old cemeteries at Pekan. The \"Makam Nibong\" which lies within a few hundred yards of the \"Makam Chondong\" is also on a platform. There are on this a number of graves but all appear to be female. On one is a clear inscription in Arabic. It is carved however in a lapidary's style which baffles the few persons in Pekan who claim to read Arabic. I could hear no traditions as to the date of these graves or as to their occupants.\n\nAnother well known grave is that called Ziarat Raja Raden. It is near the river bank within the Sultan's reserved area and not far from the Makam Chondong and Makam Nibong. The grave stones are of similar type to those of Raja Fatimah a description of which has already been published in this Journal. An inscription in Arabic which has been read for me consists of praises of God, and a difficult specimen of Arabic writing at the foot of one of the stones was recently determined to contain the name Abduljalil. A local Malay student of history decided that the grave must be that of Sultan Abduljalil of Johore who succeeded the mad Sultan Mahmud Shah II of Johore (Mangkat dijulang) in about 1700 and was himself known as Marhom Kuala Pahang. (see Wilkinson's History pamphlet pp: 53-55). This however is pure guess-work; there is no local tradition on the subject. It may be noted that Raja Raden is the name given by Godinho d'Er\u00e9dia to Sultan Alaedin Riayat Shah III of Johore, the Sultan who died at Acheen in about 1615. It is therefore a possible popular name for a ruler.\nAn old Tombstone in Pahang.\n\nBy Warren D. Barnes.\n\n(With two plates.)\n\nIn May, 1910, His Highness the Tungku Besar of Pahang was visiting Kuala Lipis, and among the presents brought to him by the local Penghulus was a gravestone which was reported to have been found some time previously in the Pahang River near the Penghulu's landing stage at Tebing Tinggi. The stone was carved with an inscription in Arabic characters which baffled the local scholars. A transcription of it was subsequently made by the Mufti at Pekan, Haji Osman bin Senik. It proved of great interest, as the stone was the gravestone of Raja Fatimah who died in A.H. 901. i.e. A.D. 1496 or fifteen years before Albuquerque captured Malacca. I propose to give a description of the stone which now lies in the Istana of His Highness at Pekan, and to discuss the identity of Raja Fatimah.\n\nThe plates which accompany this paper show the shape of the stone. Its height from its top to the bottom of the carved foot is $22\\frac{3}{4}$ inches; its width across the carved foot 14 inches, and across the face $9\\frac{1}{2}$ inches; its thickness in the thinner portion 5 inches.\n\nThe following description has been given me by Mr. J.B. Scrivenor, Government Geologist, Federated Malay States, of a chip from the bottom of it:\n\n\"This is an excellent example of a basic lava. The base is cloudy but is evidently composed to a large extent of felspar micro-liths. The felspar phenocrysts are fresh and beautifully zoned in some cases. The extinction angles are not very high and point to the felspar being andesine. Augite, almost colourless in section, is common and there is a deep brown, strongly pleochroic mineral with nearly straight extinction that occurs chiefly in prisms with strongly marked black resorption borders. This mineral is most probably basaltic hornblende, but it cannot be proved from this slide. There is one large crystal of biotite much altered.\"\n\n\"It would be interesting to compare this rock with the grave-stones in the Raffles Museum, Singapore. They appeared to me to be of the same nature.\"\n\n\"This rock, which may be called pyroxene-hornblende-andesite, might have come from some outcrop of the Pahang Volcanic Series, but I do not remember seeing anything exactly like it.\"\n\nMay, 1910.\n\nJ. B. S.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 60, 1911.\nThe carving on the stone is surprisingly fresh, and as patches of \"jadam\" or black varnish still remain visible on the stone itself\u2014they are clearly shown in the photographs\u2014it is probable that the story that it was found in the river is correct. It is in much better preservation than many stones of much more recent date. It appears likely that the whole stone was once covered with black varnish and very possibly the name on it was picked out in gold.\n\nThe photographs show:\u2014\nA. The whole stone; B. One flat side; C. The opposite flat side; D. One narrow side.\n\nThe transcription of the inscriptions as given by our local authority at Pekan is as follows:\u2014\n\n(i) B. The heart-shaped inscription above:\u2014\n   *Al ghafur*, meaning The Lord most forgiving.\n   The inscription below:\u2014\"Al-hejrat al nabi sala Allahu alaihi wa's-salam sembilan ratus sa tahun lima belas hari.\"\n\n(ii) C. The heart-shaped inscription above:\u2014\n   *Al-jalil* meaning The Lord most great.\n   The inscription below:\u2014bulan shawal malam isnin Raja Fatimah kembali ka-rahmat Allah.\n\nThe translation of the two inscriptions is:\u2014\nOn the eve of Monday the fifteenth day of the Moon Shawal in the year 901 of the Hejira of the Prophet, to whom may God give peace, Raja Fatimah returned to God's mercy.\n\n(iii) D. The heart-shaped inscription above:\u2014\n   *Al-'ala*, meaning The L'rd most high.\n   The inscription below:\u2014Arabic words meaning Death is a gate and all men go in thereat.\n\n(iv) On the other narrow side:\u2014\n   The heart-shaped inscription above:\u2014\n   *Al-aziz*, meaning The Lord most powerful.\n   The inscription below:\u2014Arabic words meaning Death is a cup and all men drink thereof.\n\n(v) On the flat top of the stone:\u2014\n   Arabic words the meaning of which has not been clearly made out.\n\nThe identity of this Raja Fatimah is fairly certain, although the early history of Pahang is not clear. The authorities are the Sejarah Malayu and the Bust\u0101n-al-Salatin, of an extract from which His Highness possesses a copy. According to the Sejarah Malayu (Shellabear's Romanised Edition, 1910, pages 82-86) Pahang with its capital Pura, i.e. the city, i.e. Pekan, was at one time under the rule of \"Siam\" and was governed by Maharaja Dewa Sura who belonged to the family of the ruler of that country. This \"Siam\" was probably not the present Thai Kingdom. It had previously sent an abortive expedition against Malacca which would appear to have followed the well-known route down the Tembeling and the Pahang and up the Bera and Serling over the 'Penarekan' to the Muar.\nIn reply, Sultan Mansur, who, according to Mr. Wilkinson's \"History\" pamphlet, 1908, page 24, came to the throne about A.D. 1459, sent a naval expedition against Pahang which captured the country and its ruler as well as the ruler's daughter, Puteri Wanang Seri, whom the Sultan subsequently married. By this marriage he had two sons, Raja Ahmad Muhammad and Raja Muhammad. Raja Ahmad Muhammad was the Sultan's favourite of all his sons and was nominated as his heir. He lost favour, however, owing to the murder by his followers of a son of the Bendahara who, when playing \"raga,\" had inadvertently so kicked the ball that it knocked off the Raja's head-dress. The Sultan accordingly banished him to his mother's country of Pahang, of which he had him installed as Sultan under the title of Sultan Muhammad. The new Sultan married the grand-daughter of the Raja of Kelantan and had three sons, Raja Ahmad, Raja Jamil, and Raja Mahmud, and a daughter who married her cousin Sultan Mahmud of Malacca\u2014the Sultan whom Albuquerque ejected in 1511. According to the Bustanu-al-Salatin, Sultan Muhammad was succeeded by his son Sultan Ahmad, who by a non-royal wife had a son Raja Mansur. The Sultan abdicated in favour of this son who married Raja Fatimah the daughter of Sultan Ala'edin Riayat Shah of Malacca who was the son of Sultan Mansur and the father of the Sultan Mahmud just mentioned. I believe that the gravestone found is that of this lady.\n\nShe would appear to have had an unhappy time in Pahang as her husband died without children being \"murdered by all his warriors.\"\n\nHis uncle Raja Jamil succeeded and was rapidly followed by the other uncle Raja Mahmud who contrived to establish himself on the throne. He seems to have married a cousin, the daughter of his uncle Raja Muhammad, and his daughter married Sultan Ala'edin Shah of Malacca, Sultan Mahmud's successor.\n\nApparently civil war followed on the death of the first Sultan of Pahang. The omission in the Sejarah Malayu of any reference to the murder of Raja Mansur might be ascribed to the author's theory that \"Malays never rebel,\" but other inconsistencies between his account and the detailed genealogy of the Bustanu-al-Salatin must be ascribed to inaccurate information and confusion between rulers of different generations who bore the same or similar names.\n\nTebing Tinggi, the place where this stone was found, is not known to have been a residence of royalty, but it is not far above Lubok Pelang to which, according to the Sejarah Malayu, Sultan Abduljamal of Pahang retired after his abdication, and where he is said to have died.\n\nAs far as I am aware, this stone is the oldest dated gravestone in the Peninsula.\nOLD TOMBSTONE, PAHANG.\nA Trip to a Source of the Sarawak River and Bengkarum Mountains.\n\nBy C. J. Brooks.\n\nAt the end of September, 1908, I had the opportunity of making a jungle excursion and decided to follow the main stream of the so-called right hand branch of the Sarawak River to its source, cross the watershed to the upper waters of the Sambas River, visit Bengkarum Mountain, and return to Sarawak by Jagnay. As far as I am able to ascertain much of the country I passed through had not been visited by a European, certainly the ascent of Bengkarum Mountain had not been made, this together with the highly interesting botanical collection obtained makes a short account of the trip of sufficient interest to place on record. The start was made from Bidi on the Twenty-first of September, where I engaged eight Dyak coolies to carry necessaries and collecting materials, with a Malay to act as Mandor. The path taken was that over Gonong Tran through the old village of the Kroking Dyaks. Here we stopped for a few minutes to adjust the various loads; this village had two years before been completely abandoned as a bad epidemic of smallpox broke out there: the Dyaks are now returning and a number of new houses are being built on the old site in spite of the insanitary conditions which exist; the hill top having become a perfect midden from the accumulation of refuse dropped through the floors of the houses. I once tried with a ten foot iron probe (used for prospecting) to reach the hard ground but this I was unable to do anywhere in the immediate neighbourhood of the houses. Descending on the further side of the hill and taking the path to the river where the new village has been built, then through undulating country covered with new jungle to the B\u2019down river which we forded, and then following for some hours a belt of old jungle, we finally forded the main stream at Tebang or Pangkaln Gumbang, which we reached at two o\u2019clock. Here is a flourishing Chinese Kampong with several pepper gardens, the situation is extremely picturesque as the houses are interspersed with groups of cocoanut palms and the surrounding country is mountainous and rugged. To escape a heavy shower which commenced just as we arrived I took shelter in a Chinaman\u2019s house, my host, with the usual Chinese hospitality offered me a cup of tea; its fine flavour caused me to enquire where he had obtained it, I found that it was of his own cultivation: this is not unusual, many up country Chinese growing their own tea plants. On leaving Tebang our path followed the river in which we had to wade for some distance\u2014the stream was shallow and fast running with large boulders among the Krangan. Here in the clear space\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 60, 1911.\nbetween the river banks were flying several specimens of the Leaf Butterfly (Kallima inachus buxtoni, More.) a great rarity in Sarawak; I was fortunate enough to capture two specimens while both of them were at rest; contrary to Wallace's observations in Sumatra they were quite easy to see, for one had alighted on the trunk of a large tree against the sky line, the other on a leaf overhanging the water. The guide missed the path leading from the river, taking us some miles in the wrong direction. The hills were now becoming very steep and following each other in constant succession as the road crosses the ranges at right angles to their direction. At dusk we entered a new clearing for a paddy field; this the coolies hailed with delight as the Teringos house for which we were making could not be far distant; the path where it entered the jungle again forked, which caused some hesitation but on my guide assuring me that either led to a house the choice was immaterial. After climbing a steep hill, the house came in view. In the dusk we could see that it was now a mass of ruins and had been abandoned for some time. Night closed in before we regained the road so that walking was now a difficult matter, becoming a succession of slips and scrambles down the hill: before going far we met a Dyak who was returning home with some bamboos filled with \"Ire Noor,\" the slightly fermented juice of the sugar palm; this the coolies seized even before enquiring the way, which we now learned was only a short distance, and in a few minutes we were enjoying the welcome shelter of a house with rest and food after a tramp of nine hours. The next morning I decided to follow the river to the Teringos falls and if possible further. The river scenery is very beautiful, the banks in places rising in steep or precipitous cliffs covered with luxuriant vegetation, the river bed filled with enormous sandstone boulders breaking it into a series of cascades, in other places almost completely hiding it from view as it flows between them, I collected a number of interesting orchids and ferns, insects were rather scarce: only a few were taken, among them was a specimen of Melanitis zitenius, Herbst. Several others were observed and unlike Melanitis ismene were flying in the bright morning sunshine, their high and strong flight made them difficult to capture. To obtain if possible any interesting specimens of fish which might occur in an upland river, I exploded dynamite cartridges in two of the deep pools but with no result; nothing rose to the surface and a Dyak who dived assured that there were none at the bottom. A succession of minor falls were passed before reaching the chief, of which the total height must be over one hundred feet, it is broken into two cascades about twenty feet from the top: there was little water running now but after heavy rain when a large river is flowing the fall must be a magnificent sight.\n\nThe path led to the face of the cliff which formed the waterfall and continued over it by a series of steep ladders, these are of the usual Dyak type, small tree trunks with deep notches cut forming steps. Above the fall the river has excavated a deep valley\nin the sandstone rock the sides of which are very steep, and the path follows a ledge somewhat below the summit, which in many places is broken by clefts and gullies bridged by battangs. After proceeding for some distance a very heavy storm broke compelling us to return to the house. The houses here are not of the type usual among land Dyaks, as each family has a detached building with a space of a few feet intervening between the houses, but they are connected by the usual bamboo platform\u2014the roofs are extremely high pitched with ordinary flap windows, the internal arrangement is such that the space in front used for paddy pounding, etc., is often separated by a large outer door, thus dividing a house into two separate rooms.\n\nI could learn nothing here of the route to Bengkarum, but most of the Dyaks were certain that from Trebong direction could be obtained, so I decided to proceed thither the following day. As the coolies were rather heavily loaded, I engaged the services of two more Dyaks; after allotting them their packages and starting I was somewhat surprised to see that one had transferred his load which was not a light one to a small girl of about eight years of age, his daughter, she, wishing to pay a call at a house which we should pass, accepted the \"privilege\" of Dyak women of carrying the men's load. By a short cut we joined the path at the falls and proceeded practically from the place where we had returned the day previously; after walking for little more than an hour we descended the ridge and crossed the stream to a fairly level tract of country surrounded on three sides by mountains: near by in a large open space were several Dyak houses. As the situation was so pleasing and the country promised well for collecting I decided to spend the remainder of the day here; we accommodated ourselves and baggage in the house belonging to the head man. A series of moans from the adjoining house attracted my attention; on entering I found a young woman suffering from a severe colic. I ordered her Dyak friends to apply two bottles filled with hot water and for her immediate relief I administered a tabloid of Warburg Tinct. On returning in the evening I found the patient had not had the bottles of hot water. I enquired the reason and to my surprise learned that they had not yet lit a fire to cook their rice and could not think of doing so before their evening meal, although they had no doubt but that the hot water would be beneficial. It was not long before those Dyaks had a fire lighted and heated the water, before cooking the rice.\n\nI now followed the course of the river in the bottom of the valley which I found to be a splendid collecting ground; my attention was immediately attracted by a beautiful scarlet orchid Dendrobium cinnabarioum, growing plentifully on many trees and flowering freely, closely resembling in habit the Pigeon orchid; many other rare orchids and ferns occur here and a large nepenthes of elegant shape; insects were rather scarce, but among the few taken was a fine specimen of Ornithoptera Brookeana.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 60, 1911.\nIn a house near my sleeping place were several large jars of salted Durien\u2014the jars being very porous, the juice was oozing out and the scent was almost intolerable. I asked to have them removed and had great difficulty in getting this done as the Dyak owners could not apparently understand how such a luxury can be objectionable. During the evening a number of Dyaks came in to have a chat-chat, each bringing a small present of rice and eggs, I disappointed them when I refused their invitation to stay another night so that they could call their friends together and give a dance in my honour. By means of a boiling point thermometer I took the altitude and found it to be about fourteen hundred feet.\n\nA good start was made the next morning at eight o'clock: the path now descending on the opposite side of the watershed was in some places extremely steep with deep gullies crossed by tree trunks felled so as to form bridges. As the heavy dew of the previous night had rendered them slippery care was necessary in crossing; for some hours we passed through new jungle which had been cleared within the last five years for paddy farming, and after fording a fair sized stream we climbed a ridge of old jungle and followed it for many miles, then descending and crossing an omah we arrived at Kapot at four o'clock. This is a large Dyak Kampong well situated on the bank of a rapid wide flowing river, and judging from the number of large fruit trees and palms growing here, it must have been an old settlement; the houses are all detached as at Teringos and of the same type, which gives it more the appearance of a Malay rather than Dyak Kampong, but the high pitched roofs present a striking contrast to both\u2014all the houses are connected by the bamboo platform. On ascending we were immediately surrounded by a large crowd of Dyaks who expressed undoubted annoyance at our intrusion\u2014my first enquiry was for the Orang Kaya, who at once came forward, and at my request for lodging, shewed us to the head house, which we entered with as many Dyaks following as the house would hold\u2014the general cry was \"what do you want?\" to which I answered that I am a Tuan from Sarawak, taking a walk to Bengkarum collecting flowers and insects, I am not a government official tax collecting, and after shewing them some of my specimens, they appeared satisfied and most of them left the house, which gave us room to open and arrange our things. My coolies were very frightened at so suddenly coming amongst strange and somewhat wild people speaking in a dialect which was unknown to them, and stood shivering in their wet clothes half inclined to try and persuade me to take the road home again. After having changed my clothes, and drunk a welcome cup of tea, I proceeded to explore the extent of the Kampong, at one end of which I came upon a large group of Dyaks dividing a fine catch of fish which they had just made and one of which had been previously given to me. The division is made, after removing the viscera, by chopping the fish into small pieces about an inch cube, then on a large mat one cube is placed for each family, and so again and again,\nuntil all the pieces have been equally distributed; I counted fifty-three portions, then a further division was made from a vessel containing a most objectionable semi-cooked mass, which I was informed was the viscera. Each recipient having provided himself with a banana leaf twisted into the form of a cup, it was ladelled into these in small quantities at a time. At the finish it was a most disgusting sight to see a number of small children licking out the trough. I noticed that an unusually large number of the natives here were attacked by Corup and many of the women had stained their entire bodies with turmeric root\u2014they state that this cures it, or perhaps only allays the irritation: the women were extremely frightened, and whenever I appeared, beat a hasty retreat, being the first white man they had seen. After my evening meal a large number of the natives came to see me, each bringing a small present of eggs or rice; among them was the Orang Kayah and his wife, the only woman who dared to come near or speak to me during my stay with them: they were both dressed in state costume, which consisted, in the case of the former, of a high crowned military cap with broad band of silver lace and button to match, given to him by the Dutch Government: the lady was wearing a gaily coloured bead cap about eight inches high and tapering considerably, together with a blue cotton jacket, the edges trimmed with beads: we discussed politics which were not considered to be in a very satisfactory condition here, paddy, and many other matters, and I was pleased to learn that Bengkarum or Krum, as it is called here, was at no great distance; and I heard that a Malay who represented the government was resident here and would call upon me in the morning; my visitors stayed until a late hour, I heard them talking long after I had retired to my curtain.\n\nThe next morning on descending to the river to bathe, I was surprised to find that the Dyaks of both sexes were bathing in a state of nudity. I understand however, that this is customary among Dyaks who are quite out of contact with Chinese or Europeans. The Malay official called while I was breakfasting, he was very polite, and offered any assistance that he could give me: as the coolies were tired after the long tramp of the previous day, I decided to let them rest, while I spent the time collecting in the neighbourhood, which did not prove very productive. From the summit of a hill I had a splendid view of Bengkarum Mountain which could not be more than ten miles distant. In the evening we had but few Dyaks to visit us, of these, two were men who had been most enthusiastic to accompany me, and had told me they knew the road to Bengkarum; they now explained that the purpose of their visit was to enquire if I really intended to go; if so, although previously having promised to go with me, they refused, and then with a great deal of talk I was given to understand that no one else would, in fact no one did go, there was no road, the mountain was quite unclimbable and the place was so full of Antus (spirits) that something unlucky would happen; however, after\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 60, 1911.\nrepeatedly telling them that now I had come so far, if I could not get from this place, I would from another, they withdrew. I was much annoyed at this, and of course the coolies were much upset, half inclined to believe that the Antus had already started some mischief\u2014they spent a very restless night, hardly any of them sleeping. In the morning I interviewed the Orang Kayah, he informed me that this information was in part correct, as the Dyaks here did not extend their excursions as far as this mountain; but from the next village I could most likely get directions and he would send a coolie to take me there. After waiting for some time for the promised coolie, I decided to apply to my Malay friend who immediately directed a Dyak to act as my guide.\n\nWe commenced the journey by wading for some distance down the river and then began an extremely trying and severe ascent of Gonong Trebong: the road although good was exposed to a glaring sun at a very steep incline, it was nearly two hours before we gained the top of the ridge on which the house is situated, immediately below it is a spring of deliciously cold water issuing from a crack in the sandstone; the Dyaks told me that however dry the season this spring never fails. This house Lawang is extremely dirty and erected on the top of a very narrow ridge, the rocky sides of which are so steep that the only possible ascent is by ladders for the last fifty feet. We were greeted by a few women and children who directed us to the head house, which was barely large enough to accommodate all the coolies; it was annoying to find that all the men, or any who could direct us, were away in the jungle and not returning till sundown, so that this necessitated a wait until the following day; the view from this house is imposing; on one side of the ridge Mount Bengkarum stands out clearly against the sky, on the other a fine stretch of country as far as the eye could see looking towards Sarawak with ranges of hills in succession. The Dyaks here are a most unhealthy crowd, it was difficult to find a man, woman, or child, who was not affected with some form of skin disease or festering sores, despite the fine healthy situation of the house (which I found to be about two thousand feet above the sea level;) my Malay Mandor told me that he considered it due to the fact that their hill paddy is poor stuff and that they consume the entrails of any animal they kill.\n\nThere were a few heads hung in the apex of the roof of the head house and immediately below was constructed a broad shelf on which any youth sleeps who may wish to shew his courage; a conspicuous object in all head houses of this district is the \"sekardoo,\" this is a large hollow wooden cylinder formed from the trunk of the Lune or other fairly light wood, varying from fifteen to twenty feet in length and about two feet six inches in diameter: over one end is tightly stretched a green hide from which the hair has been removed, they are slung at an angle below the floor of the head house, above which the hide covered end projects a few feet the one in this particular house was certainly over\ntwenty feet long and slung so that it was parallel with the slope of the hill. I understood that when beaten it could be heard at Gumbang, a distance of over twenty miles; formerly they were used to warn the district of head hunting raids, they are now going out of use. I was much amused in watching a number of youngsters constructing a head house for themselves, building on slender posts jammed into the crevices of the rocks on the steep side of the hill over which it hung most perilously.\n\nThere was no difficulty in finding a coolie to conduct us the next morning although they were not certain of the whole route, this we should learn at an intermediate house. An early start was made; from this altitude a heavy mist on the lowlands presented a somewhat curious effect, all the ridges and hill tops standing out clearly above it and isolated from each other like islands in a sea of white silent billows; about noon we reached a very dirty and dilapidated Dyak house, whence we obtained complete directions to Bengkarum, the way being through varied and hilly country; we soon commenced to ascend the lower slopes of the mountain; at four o'clock we reached Kampong Temong, a large Dyak house on a spur of the mountain; we accommodated ourselves in the head house, a very high awkward structure, but its airy position gave it a decided advantage over the usually low building, in that it was well above the most unpleasant association of a Dyak village, the scent of the pigs! My first visitor was an elderly gentleman who obviously wished to impress us with his importance; this was somewhat suddenly interrupted by the appearance of the Orang Kaya himself, a fine, well made man; he told me on enquiring, that the ascent was an easy matter and that near the top was a large lanko (shelter) in which we could pass the night, as the ascent and descent could not be accomplished on the same day; he also arranged to have coolies ready for me to start the next morning. During the evening the elderly gentleman called, to say that he had decided to go with me and asked what provision we had made for water; as this seemed rather a serious matter, I told him that we could carry enough with us in bamboos; at this he gave a grunt and smile of superiority to which Dyaks at times give way, I found later in the evening that it was his little joke, there was plenty of water on top.\n\nAt eight o'clock the following morning all stores were packed and with my friend as guide we commenced the ascent; for some distance we followed a small stream and on its widening out into a good clear pool, I was astonished to see the elderly gentleman who was leading, stop and divest himself of the few clothes he was wearing. At my protest, he answered that it was a good place for a bath and he had not been there for some time. The ascent is steep but nowhere difficult, for a short distance the path is on a ridge formed by a sandstone bed, which has been thrown over at right angles to its plane of bedding. As it is not more than two feet wide and either side is a drop of fifty to eighty feet, the passage across\nrequires careful walking; the lanco was found to be commodious and in good condition, thatched with split bamboo and arranged in the usual manner; here we deposited our baggage and proceeded to the summit, which was only a short distance.\n\nBengkarum Mountain, from the isolated position of this enormous mass of sandstone, its sudden rise and the long ridge of summit gradually increasing in height to terminate with precipitous abruptness at its eastern extremity is a conspicuous feature in the landscape for a radius of many miles; in plan it is roughly shaped like a capital Y, the two ridges which form the fork bearing towards the west; the ascent was made from the base of the southernmost of these; the summit at this end which is the lower, I found to have an elevation of 3,500 feet. It is a plateau of some width, the surface being very irregular, worn into deep gullies and depressions which in the overgrown jungle was well nigh impossible to travel over; for some distance I followed a small stream which forms the main drainage and flows to the fork, descending in a series of cascades; the banks are rich in filmy ferns and on a nearly submerged sandbank was growing a small fern which proved to be of considerable interest; being a new species which necessitated the formation a new genus. The Dyaks here collect large quantities of teardammar, these trees were very numerous and of large size. As usual at this altitude the ground was covered with Sphagnum, while the trunks and brushwood were also covered with other species of mosses.\n\nAs I was about to descend from the edge of the summit the magnificence of the view at once caught my attention; in the foreground was the further limb of the mountain covered with its deep green, the base thrown into deep shadow as the sun declined, while the stream as it cascaded down the mountain side gave life and contour; then beyond was range after range, in many places irregular and broken, lit by the full sunshine and as the distance increased the green gave place to blue with the final haze of the horizon. The conical summit of Mt. Nach could be seen to the south-west well above all intermediate ranges.\n\nWhile taking my evening meal the elderly gentleman asked for the chicken bones and much to the general amusement scrunched and swallowed them as well as any dog: the body of a small bird which I had skinned he stewed in a long bamboo, adding various herbs gathered in the neighbourhood. Some little excitement was caused by his difficulty in recovering it from the depths of this vessel, as he refused to split it. The night was bitterly cold with rain and wind which made sleep quite out of the question for the coolies, who had no extra clothing and tried as well as they could to keep warm by sitting over the fire, while I in woollen garments was in nearly the same plight. The following morning was spent collecting on the slopes and a fair number of insects were captured before the sky clouded and the whole mountain was covered in mist\u2014which decided me to return to the Dyak Kampong.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nAs my collections were now in excess of the botanical paper I had brought with me, I resolved to make as hasty a return as possible to Bidi by way of Siluas. The next morning on making our way through the Dyaks paddy field, at the far entrance I came upon a splendid trophy which these Dyaks had erected as an offering to the spirits who guard the growth of their crops; it consisted of small sized wooden models of all the implements they use in agriculture as well as jars, parangs, and the common utensils of a Dyak house. As part of the journey to Siluas has to be taken by water from Pankalu Bobong, I was much disappointed on arriving there to find that the only boat which would hold my coolies and collections had left early that morning; a Malay trader here proved to be an old acquaintance of my Mandor and kindly ordered his son to try and hire one from a Dyak house a few miles distant; after waiting two hours I was only able to procure a small boat capable of holding four people, and as it was uncertain whether another would be procurable for some days, I decided to proceed in it, leaving my coolies to follow as soon as they could.\n\nA fair amount of Coffee is in cultivation here, doing well on the alluvial soil, the trees are healthy and full of berries. At dusk when nearing Siluas we overtook an old Dyak, whom I recognized as having worked for me at Bidi. At his suggestion I decided to stop the night at his house at Ire Lickie, which was convenient for starting the next day; this was a far more comfortable structure than is usual to find Dyaks living in\u2014it had three separate compartments, the best of which was at once cleared for my use, while fresh eggs and rice were offered to me; as there were two other Dyaks beside my old coolie resident in the house I expected to obtain carriers easily the next morning, but on rising my hopes received a check as two of the men were prostrate, with high fever. This they told me was very prevalent in the neighbourhood of this river. After much persuasion I induced the remaining coolie to accompany me to the next village which we reached after two hours walk. This house Teberau consists of one long building and although low, is commodious; the Dyaks are of a type strange to any I had before met; it was more marked in the women who are of short stature and decidedly pretty, in feature akin to Tamil women. Without exception each woman was wearing a small plaited straw cap about six inches in height, tapering slightly, decorated with highly coloured geometric designs; in casual appearance there was little difference between these caps and those worn by the \"Bombay\" shopkeepers at Colombo. The Dyaks were in rather an excited condition as a Patrol of Dutch police had spent the night here and were at this late hour about to make a start; they were conducting back a Malay prisoner who had escaped from Sambas to Sarawak; here my coolie left me and it was only by promising the exorbitant sum of two dollars each that I could persuade two others to take his place as far as Bidi.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 60, 1911.\nAt two o'clock we reached Pankalu Babong; from here the distance was too great to reach Bidi the same day, which was annoying after a comparatively short day's walk. This was a large well built Kampong, the Dyaks, some of them big strapping men, are of the Jaguay type to which tribe they claim kinship although they are Dutch subjects. A great deal of noise was being made in the head house, caused by beating of gongs and gindans. On enquiring the reason I heard that some six months ago they had obtained a head, having been called out by the Government in an expedition against some rebellious tribes at the ulu of the Sambas river; the festivities with which they had feasted the head were still being kept up by the younger members of the house; on inspection I found the head had been divided, having been shared with another house. It was lying in a small shelter which had been made to receive it, containing various offerings placed near it, eggs, tobacco, etc.\n\nAt about nine o'clock I was very pleased to see my coolies arrive. They had constructed a raft and were thus enabled to follow me quickly. I could now dispense with my engaged help at my own rate of pay. An early start the next morning brought us to Pangkalm Tipong at one o'clock and to Bidi an hour later.\n\nI should like to conclude by saying a word respecting my excellent Malay Mandor Mahomet who was at all times ready to carry out my wishes and assist in every possible way to the desired end, and to Madoo the best of Krokong Dyaks.\n\n---\n\nA List of the more interesting ferns collected at Mount Bengkarum and elsewhere.\n\nCyathea Sarawakensis, Hooker.

RIDLEY, M.A., F.R.S.\n\nThe three existing groups of the Gymnosperms, Coniferae, Gnetaceae and Cycadeae are represented in the Malay peninsula but not by any means abundantly nor do any form a conspicuous feature in the flora.\n\nThe Conifers, more abundant in temperate than in warm climates, are almost confined to the group Taxaceae. We have one species of the Araucarieae, Agathis, and of Taxaceae including the group Podocarpeae, seven species of two genera, Dacrydium and Podocarpus.\n\nNow the geographical distribution of these conifers is of some interest. In the forests of the low country up to nearly 1000 feet we have only three species; Podocarpus Wallichianus, P. neriifolius and P. polystachyus, the latter two closely allied. The two first are natives also of Khasiya, and the tropical Himalaya. This section of Podocarps with yew like leaves is widely scattered over the whole of the tropics of both hemispheres descending into colder regions of the south Chile, Australasia, Japan, South Africa.\n\nWhen we get to the mountain regions we have Agathis (or Dammara), Dacrydium elatum, D. falciforme and D. Beccarii and the very distinct Podocarpus cupressinus, with foliage of two forms very unlike anything in the Indian region. All these occur in Borneo, and in other islands to the east, but are absent from the Himalayan or northern region; one or two do get as far as Burmah and Cambodia, but there they disappear. Thus our conifers appear to have invaded the peninsula from two directions. The lowland ones from the north, the mountain ones from the east. All the latter occur in Borneo also with the addition of two more Podocarps P. imbricatus Bl. and P. Teysmanni and another genus, Phyllocladus P. hypophyllus, Hook fil.) of which the other known species come from New Zealand, Tasmania, the Philippines and New Guinea. There is one more genus which we might expect to find in the Peninsula, but which certainly has not yet been seen, and that is the northern genus Pinus of which one species, Pinus Merkusii Jungh, occurs in Tenasserim, Sumatra and Borneo.\n\nIn all our conifers except Agathis the ovule when ripe is drupeaceous and red in colour and these are swallowed and so dispersed by birds. Agathis like the pine trees has winged seed that can drift to but a short distance so that its dispersal over the large area it covers must have taken a very long time. It belongs to the group of Araucarieae which includes the genera Araucaria of South America, Polynesia and Australia; Agathis in Australasia and Polynesia and up through the Eastern Malay Archipelago to Penang and Cunninghamia and Sciadopitys of the Japanese and Chinese region.\nCONIFER\u00c6.\n\nTrees or shrubs usually evergreen, with coriaceous ovate, linear or acicular leaves sometimes reduced to scale leaves. Flowers unisexual usually on distinct trees, Perianth none, Males in catkins of scales bearing two or more anther cells, Females in catkins of scales each bearing one or two winged seeds, or solitary terminal ovules, on a scale leaf. Ovules naked, erect or decurved, winged, when in cones; drupaceous when solitary.\n\nDistribution whole world chiefly in temperate climates.\n\nLeaves ovate, fruit a cone Agathis\nFruit drupaceous, Ovule erect, Dacrydium\nOvule decurved adnate to the scale. Podocarpus\n\nAGATHIS.\n\nBig tree with coriaceous ovate leaves. Male cones cylindric of numerous scales bearing ten or twelve pollens\u00e6s, Female cone large more or less globose of large scales spirally arranged imbricate with broad tips. Ovuliferous scale thin and confluent with the scale. Ovules 1 or 2 adnate to the scale. Seed 1 compressed winged, albumen fleshy, cotyledons 2.\n\nA. loranthifolia, Salisb. Trans. Liun Soc.

Malay Archipelago. \"Poko Damar Minyak.\"\n\nWarburg. lc. broke up the Agathis of the Malay region into a number of species very imperfectly described. The Malay peninsular one of which he seems only to have seen a specimen from Lambert's collection of doubtful origin, but probably Penang, he describes as A. rhomboidalis. The differences in his various species seem to be so slight, and probably either\nlocal or due to some slight variation on a branch or tree that I think it inadvisable to adopt them. Specimens from Gunong Tahan differ from the common Malay form in the much thicker and rounder leaves.\n\n**Dacrydium.**\n\nTrees often attaining a great size, unisexual. Leaves acicular, linear or scale-like. Male cones small, scales lanceolate with 2 anther cells. Female flowers solitary on the ends of the branches.

It has long been cultivated in Singapore from Penang hill plants, and there forms a large cone-shaped bush, flowering in June. The locality \"Singapore Schomburgk,\" given in the Flora of British India is from one of these garden plants. The young tree till it is about 14 feet tall, has only the needle like leaves, and is very handsome resembling a young spruce fir; full grown trees have only the scale leaves, except where pruned on the old wood when they produce branches of acicular leaves.\n\n*R.

LAWRENCE.\n\nWith two plates.\n\nIn remote times the custom of head pressing in one form or another has been practised in many parts of the world. Nowadays however, the people who still hold to this remarkable habit are few in number and of local distribution. So far as the Malayan region is concerned, it appears to be confined to the Milanos of Sarawak, and to certain natives of Celebes. In all probability, the custom will die out amongst the Milanos at no very distant date; nevertheless at the present day a great majority of Milano women bear on their heads the unmistakable evidence of the press. A few only of the men have been thus deformed, though apparently it was at one time a privilege bestowed on all; a privilege because the press is considered to impart beauty to the subject.\n\nThe operation is performed during early infancy, the first application of the press being made when the child is only a week or two old: it is discontinued about three or four months afterwards. The apparatus employed is called a \"Ja\" at Mukah, an \"Api\" at Oya and at Bintulu a \"Tadal:\" the press itself is exactly the same at these three places. A \"Ja\" is simply a board of hard wood, shaped as in the figure, attached by strings to a T shaped piece of cloth which supports the back of the head: the central part of the wood rests upon a pad which is applied to the infant's forehead. The pad is made of folded up leaves or of cloth, and sometimes to increase its weight a flat stone or piece of wood occupies the interior of the pad. The strings which cross the board from end to end pass through a coin which is ordinarily situated at the centre of the board: by twisting the coin round and round the strings are tightened as in a torniquet and thus the pressure on the head may be gradually increased. When applying the \"Ja,\" the infant is taken between the legs of the father or mother and the apparatus is gently fitted over its head. At first the strings are fairly loose and the inconvenience experienced by the child is slight: after a few minutes when her offspring is asleep, the mother carefully adds to the pressure of the \"Ja,\" by twisting the coin round a few times: this she repeats at intervals of about ten minutes until, as she judges, the maximum pressure consistent with safety is attained: when the child finally wakens, the \"Ja\" is removed. This operation then is conducted only during the sleeping hours of the child, commencing at about 9 a.m. and resuming again about 2 p.m.: at night time, the baby has a respite as the \"Ja\" demands too much trouble of the parent. It occasionally happens that too much\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 63, 1911.\npressure is exerted and the child dies, but this is a rare occurrence as the Milanos are very fond of their children and prefer to forego the pressing altogether if the child protests too much.\n\nThe most obvious result of this operation is a well marked depression of the forehead: there is presumably a corresponding uprising of other parts of the head, but being distributed more or less uniformly over the rest of the cranium this is not recognisable. Head pressed Milanos usually have a characteristic squint in both eyes and occasionally the base of the nose is depressed.\n\nWhether this custom ordinarily affects their mental ability is not certain though some observers believe that it really has a prejudicial effect: the average Milano certainly is rather a dull person, but the same may also be said of the Land Dayaks, who have never practised head pressing.\n\nNo incantations or religious ceremonies are associated with this remarkable custom and apparently the only element therein which savours of religion is the charms which are always attached to the ja. The charm, called \"Luan\" by Milanos, consists of a few flakes of soot scraped off from the family cooking pot: it is sewn up with cloth into tiny packets which are attached by strings to the ja. Similar charms are in use amongst the same people in other capacities: for instance such a charm is usually to be found tied to a Bayoh (medicine man) man's drum.\n\nIn addition to the Luan every ja is provided with a large blue bead which is attached to the string that goes over the head: this bead also functions as a charm.\n\nAfter it has once been used a Ja may not be given away: they are in fact kept in use through several generations. One's neighbours are very fond of borrowing a lucky ja\u2014one which always presses well\u2014especially if it be an old one.\n\nThis custom is now falling into disuse for the very simple reason that it involves too much trouble: nowadays the housewife has to work hard to earn a living and it is very inconvenient to have to suspend the sago working every few minutes in order to attend to a sleeping baby.\n\nSo far as is known head pressing is not practised elsewhere in Borneo. Nevertheless it should be noted that heads are often enough unintentionally deformed slightly, we believe, as a result of the very hard pillow\u2014of wood alone\u2014on which the infant rests when sleeping. This fact may account for a characteristic flatness often noticeable at the back of a Land Dayaks head. In north-west Celebes where the natives flatten heads and breasts the language has, according to the Rev. B. Mulder, many words in common with Milano: and moreover they have very similar fairy tales. It is therefore quite possible that the two peoples have been neighbours or even that they are related: nevertheless it is almost certain that the Milanos have lived for some\u2014probably many\u2014centuries in Sarawak and if there is any relationship it must have been in very remote times. The following tables give a few statistics which\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nhave bearing on this custom.

Moulton, F.E.S., F.L.S., F.Z.S.,\nCurator of the Sarawak Museum.\n\nPart III.\n(LYCAENIDAE).\n\nParts I and II of this list, dealing with the Nymphalidae and Lemoniidae only, were published by Mr. Shelford in this Journal in 1904 and 1905 (Nos. 41 and 45). Mr. Shelford being unable to continue it, suggested that I should do so\u2014a task I have gladly undertaken. This Part deals with the whole of the Bornean Lycaenidae, the most numerous of all the Families in Bornean Rhopalocera. The growth in our knowledge of the Lycaenidae of this country may be seen from the following figures:\u2014Mr. Distant\u00b9 in his great work, *Rhopalocera Malayana*, gives 32 species of Lycaenidae from Borneo. Mr. W. B. Pryer\u00b2 after some 9 years' collecting in British North Borneo could only record 35 species (1887); before that, Mr. Herbert Druce\u00b3 had recorded 71 collected in the neighbourhood of Labuan by Sir Hugh Low (1873); a number, which was increased to about 220 by Mr. Hamilton H. Druce\u2074 (1895), who had examined a large amount of material in the Godman-Salvin collection together with the Kina Balu and Labuan captures made by Waterstradt and Wahnes. Mr. Druce\u2075 published a second paper in 1896 increasing the total to 262; since that date some of the genera have been monographed and some new species described; including these and the species described for the first time in this paper, the total number of named forms and varieties now recorded from Borneo is 317; of which 300 are regarded here as true species. In comparison with these figures it may not be out of place to mention that de Nic\u00e9ville and Martin\u2076 recorded 238 Lycaenidae from Sumatra out of a total of 756 Rhopalocera; so we may regard our present list as having some pretensions to completeness.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Distant, *Rhopalocera Malayana*, 1882.\n\u00b2 Pryer, *Annals and Magazine of Natural History*, 1887.\n\u00b3 Druce, *Proc.

Beng.*, Vol. LXIV, Part II, no. 3, pp. 357-555, 1895.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 58, 1911.\nThe system of classification followed in the first portion of this paper is that laid down by Col. Bingham in his volume on Indian Butterflies (*Fauna of British India Series, Butterflies*, Vol. II. 1907), which deals with five out of the seven Sub-Families occurring in this region. Of the remaining two Sub-Families, I have followed Mr. Bethune-Baker's recent monograph for the *Arhopalinae* (\"A revision of the Amblypodia group of the Family Lycaenidae,\" *Trans. Zool. Soc. Lond.*, Vol. XVII. pp. 1-153 Pi. I-V. 1903), and for the *Theclinae*, in the absence of any more up-to-date work, I have endeavoured to follow out the lines of classification suggested by Mr. de Nic\u00e9ville in his *Butterflies of India*, Vol. III. 1890.\n\nMr. Shelford has kindly furnished me with a few field-notes, which I have added under his initials; and I am further indebted to him for much valuable advice and help received from time to time during the compilation of this paper. Dr. T. A. Chapman has kindly identified some of the Lycaenopsids for me, a difficult group unless one has devoted much study to its various species. To Mr. G. T. Bethune-Baker I owe thanks for help with some of the Arhopalas. And lastly, it is with much pleasure I take this opportunity of recording my indebtedness to Mr. Hamilton H. Druce, who has continually placed his valuable services at my disposal. Doubtfully identified species have been sent to him on and off for the last two years and without his help many little points would have still remained unravelled. The Superintendent of the Indian Museum has kindly supplied details of the Bornean Lycaenidae in the collections of that Museum.\n\nAlthough the general system laid down by Mr. Shelford for Parts I and II, has been followed for this Part, I have considered it advisable to amplify it on one or two points. Thus in quoting the literature for each species I have given the reference to the original description first, then the name and reference of any species that has been proved synonymous; in cases where the original description being for one sex only, the other sex has been described elsewhere, I have given both references.\n\nAs Borneo is the third largest island in the world, it would seem superfluous to remark on the vagueness of \"Borneo\" as a habitat for any species, although this has sufficed for many writers on the different branches of the Fauna of Borneo. However, care has been taken in this paper to give as many exact localities as possible; so that by this means some traces of relationship may be indicated between the fauna of different parts of Borneo and the surrounding countries, and between the mountain fauna of Borneo and that, for instance, of Upper Burma and the Himalayas. The majority of localities are taken from the fine collection in the Sarawak Museum, and for that reason many of those names are of places in Sarawak. The same geographical order of names is always adhered to, viz. starting from Sandakan on the North-East coast, going round to the North of the island, then south-westwards.\nand taking in Mt. Kina Balu, through Lawas, Limbang, Brunei to the western limit of Sarawak territory; then south through Sambas, and Pontianak and so along the South coast to Bandjermasin and Pulo Laut where Mr. Doherty collected many species.\n\nIt is proposed to follow Mr. Shelford's original idea of reserving a discussion on the geographical distribution of Bornean Butterflies for an Appendix, to be added after the completion of the whole list. However, it will not be out of place to give here the following figures, which indicate some of the principal features of the distribution of Bornean Lycaenidae.\n\nOut of the 300 species recorded, no less than 117 are at present confined to Borneo as far as we know. Of the remainder, 120 are common to Borneo and the Malay Peninsula (Burma to Singapore), 98 to Borneo and Sumatra, and 47 to Borneo and Java. The comparatively small relationship with the Philippines, Celebes and New Guinea (including Australia) is shown by the occurrence of 41, 13 and 14 Bornean species respectively in those countries.\n\nDue regard has been paid to the importance of recording any variations in all the forms, and the Sarawak Museum collection has been carefully examined for this purpose.\n\nThe following new species are now described for the first time. Those marked with an asterisk indicate that they were noted as new by Mr. Shelford, but not described, and I have retained his names for those species.\n\n| No. | Species                        | Description          |\n|-----|--------------------------------|----------------------|\n| 270.| Allotinus strigatus            |                      |\n| 272.| Allotinus borneensis           |                      |\n| *498.| Charana? abnormis             |                      |\n| 289.| Logania drucei                 |                      |\n| 298.| Neopithecop oskewa             |                      |\n| 314.| Lycaenopsis lingga             |                      |\n| *315.| Lycaenopsis nigerrimus         |                      |\n| 318.| Lycaenopsis delapra            |                      |\n| *354.| Lampides vyneri                |                      |\n| *381.| Poritia pasira                 |                      |\n| 402.| Arhopala incerta               |                      |\n| 428.| Arhopala sarawaca              |                      |\n| 432.| Arhopala tembaga               |                      |\n| 451.| Arhopala shelfordi             |                      |\n| 452.| Arhopala rajah                 |                      |\n| 474.| Tajuria sunia                  |                      |\n| 486.| Chiaria batua                  |                      |\n| 497.| Charana splendida              |                      |\n| *498.| Charana? abnormis              |                      |\n| 506.| Horaga albistigmata            |                      |\n\nSome of the Bornean Lycaenidae have been described from one sex only, and I am able to furnish descriptions of the hitherto-unknown sex of the following species:\n\n| No. | Species                        | Description          |\n|-----|--------------------------------|----------------------|\n| 311.| Lycaenopsis sonchus            | H.

On a closer examination it was seen that both the ants and the butterfly were sucking the fluid secretion from the cloacal aperture of some small larval Fulgoridae or Jassidae. The larvae rested placidly whilst their attendant guests imbibed the presumably sweet fluid; but when disturbed they hopped off the leaf and were lost in the surrounding vegetation]. R. S.\n\nSimilar cases have been reported to me by native collectors during the last eighteen months in connection with other Gerydin\u00e6 (viz., Gerydus ancon, Allotinus horsfieldi, A. nivalis, Logania sriwa, L. drucei and L. staudingeri); and in May this year (1911) I was fortunate enough to make the observation myself.\n\nThe above observations are of some interest as affording a parallel to the case of Allotinus horsfieldi, Moore, which was observed by Col. H. J. W. Barrow, R.A.M.C., in attendance on Aphidae in India.\n\nThe record of the two Logania species attending Homoptera is interesting because their legs are of normal length, while those of Allotinus and Gerydus are peculiarly long, and as remarked by Col. Barrow, are well adopted for standing over a mass of Aphides.\n\n261. Gerydus ancon, Doherty.\n\nGerydus ancon, Doherty, Journ. As. Soc.

Druce, but differs in the basal region of fuscous almost joining that of the hind-margin\u2014one millimetre only separates them in the male; while in the female this fuscous area does not approach that of the hind-margin quite so much; in *gigas* the reverse is the case according to Druce\u2019s description. The swollen portion of the third margin quite so much; in *gigas* the reverse is the case according to Druce\u2019s description. The swollen portion of the third median nervule in the male is about one-fifth of an inch long as in *gigas*. It seems probable therefore that there are really three forms of *G. ancon*.\n\n(i) The Tenasserim-Burma form in which the whole band of the fore-wing is completely divided (*G. ancon*, Doherty).\n\n(ii) The Sarawak form in which it is nearly divided, culminating in the extreme form\u2014\n\n(iii) The Mt.

Allotinus strigatus, n. sp.\n\nMale. Upperside. Dark brown. Fore-wing: uniform dark brown, except for an ovoid patch beyond cell; this patch is less defined and more ovoid than in A. horsfieldi, Moore; the four light costal spots, present in that species, are also to be seen in strigatus. Hind-wing: uniform dark brown; hind margin rounded, less crenelated than in male horsfieldi.\n\nUnderside. Light grey-brown ground-colour crossed by transverse lines of brown strigae and further darkened by many small brown spots and slender strigae. Fore-wing: three short broken lines are formed by transverse strigae at base, centre and end of cell; these are succeeded by a well marked sub-marginal series of inter-nervular strigae. Hind-margin is bordered by a line of small inter-nervular black-brown spots outwardly touched with whitish-grey. Inner marginal region more or less devoid of spots or strigae. Hind-wing: a small brown spot at base, succeeded by a broken concave series of three larger spots across the basal region; these in turn succeeded by a more pronounced line of five strigae across the discal area; followed by a sub-marginal concave series of six lunular transverse strigae; marginal black-brown spots as in fore-wing. Cilia light grey-brown as in ground-colour.\n\nFemale. Upperside. Uniform dark fuscous. Underside. Markings and coloration as in the male.

Upperside.** Dark brown. **Fore-wing:** uniform dark brown, except for an elongated narrow discal streak, starting on the median nervure at base of second median nervule, and continuing along the third median nervule to a point 2\u20143 mm. from the hind-margin. Four whitish, generally indistinct, spots along the outer edge of costa as in *A. horsfieldi*, Moore. **Hind-wing:** uniform dark brown. **Underside.** Light drab ground-colour, covered with small brown transverse strigae and spots, which give a light-brown mottled appearance. **Fore-wing:** three transverse strigae\u2014at base, centre and end of cell\u2014are slightly larger than the rest. Inner marginal area is free from spots and strigae. Hind-margin bordered by a row of seven small inter-nervular black-brown spots, outwardly edged with creamy white; the two spots nearest the apex have an additional touch of black-brown on the outer edge of the white. **Hind-wing:** basal and inner-marginal region slightly freer from spots and strigae. Fusion of spots forms three large strigae situated above and below the second sub-costal nervule and at end of cell; a rough sub-marginal row of smaller transverse strigae; hind-marginal row of small black-brown spots as in fore-wing, except that the whitish outer edging is very much reduced. Cilia light drab as ground-colour in both wings. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen concolorous with the wings; below: palpi, thorax and abdomen whitish.\n\n**Female. Upperside.** Dark-brown. **Fore-wing:** uniform dark-brown. Four whitish spots along the outer edge of the costa as in the male. **Hind-wing:** uniform dark-brown. Much more square than the male, a peculiarity which is formed by the extension of the third median nervule into the anal angle so as to suggest a rudimentary tail.\u00b9\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Druce remarks on *A. caudatus*, female, that this extension of the third median nervule so as to form a blunt tail, distinguishes that species (*caudatus*) from all others in the genus.

Dark fuscous, relieved by small circular blue-white discal patch in fore-wing situated across the base of the three median nervules, but not reaching the cell, discocellular nervule or submedian nervure. Cilia dark fuscous. Hind-margin of fore-wing uneven, of hind-wing very slightly scolloped at the anal angle. Underside. Partly tawny-fuscous, part plumbous-fuscous. Fore-wing, with two transverse striae: one rather indistinct across the cell, the other, well-defined, closing the cell. The costal half of the fore-wing is tawny fuscous, the remainder plumbous-fuscous. Hind-wing: irregular and indistinct transverse striae below costa and at base, succeeded outwardly by a well-defined reniform spot below the costa and two indistinct and irregular striae closing cell and joining inner margin; an irregular post-discal chain of indistinct transverse striae. Cilia dark fuscous.\n\nFemale. Upperside. Large blue-white discal patch in fore-wing, with dark fuscous apical area from costa to anal angle and slightly diffuse along the inner margin; light fus-\ncous scales at base of fore-wing. Hind-wing, fuscous with plumbous tinge across the disc to inner margin. Apex of fore-wing more obtuse and hind-margin more rounded than in the male. Underside. As in male, except that the striae are more distinct, and that a hind-marginal row of indistinct dark spots can be seen in both wings.\n\nExp. al. \u2642, 25 mm., \u2640, 24 mm.\n\nTypes. (Male and female) Matang Road, near Kuching, Sarawak, February 22nd and 23rd, 1911 (Sar. Mus.).\n\nTaken commonly in the same locality during the first four months of the year (1911). Dedicated to Mr. H. H. Druce to whom I owe much for continued help in the preparation of this paper. He examined this species (among many others) for me and writes that, in his opinion, it is quite distinct from L. massalia, Doberty, although allied to it\u2014a species which occurs in the Malay Peninsula, Java and Sumatra. He notes that in drucei the discal spot above is much bluer and more defined, and below, the ground colour appears to be plumbous white, which is not the case in massalia; further, that the margins are more even than in massalia, where they are slightly scolloped, while in standingeri and distantl they are more scolloped.\n\nOne of the females has a small piece out of the anal angle of the left hind-wing, suggestive of an attack made by a bird or lizard enemy. It is curious that out of some 200 Gerydinae examined, this is the only specimen bearing any signs of an attack.\u00b9\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 For the importance of recording the evidence of attacks made on butterflies by their enemies and for an interesting discussion on this problem, see Essays on Evolution by Professor E. B. Poulton, F. R. S. 1908, pp. 70, 281-3,304 and 325. It is due to the suggestive remarks of Professor Poulton that I have carefully noted all the signs of injuries exhibited in the Bornean Lycaenidae examined by me, descriptions of which will be found throughout this paper. The accumulation of such records is of general value in helping to refute certain statements made now and again in entomological circles, namely that butterflies are not subject to such severe attacks as has been frequently claimed; the authors basing their statements as a rule on the paucity of direct observations, without taking into account the mass of indirect evidence, which, though available in most large collections, is not often recognized, or the important evidence adduced from the examination of birds' stomachs for instance. The special interest of the observations made in this paper lies in the support given by them to the theory of Directive Markings, eg. as exhibited by the anal markings and tails in many Theclinae, which are rendered conspicuous in order to direct an enemy's attack to a non-vital part. Hence the absence of attacks noted on the Gerydinae, which rely on a different method for protection, namely that of proryptic colouring. (See concluding paragraph on this subject under 553.\u2014Virachola smilis on page 173 of this paper). That there are relatively few instances noted in this paper is due to the fact that nearly all the specimens examined belong to a collection of \"naturally selected\" good specimens\u2014the careful work of native collectors and Museum Curators for the last 20 years! I should also add that no mention is made of worn and damaged specimens, whose injuries might be attributed to other causes.\n\nJour, Straits Branch\nSub-Family II.

The type in the British Museum is a specimen intermediate between the wet and the dry season broods, in which the disc of the fore-wing on the upperside is much paler, with a small spot of white in the middle.\"\n\nIn Borneo the seasons are not very definitely marked: though the \"landas\" or \"wet season\" sets in about October and usually lasts until February or March. An examination of 12 specimens in the Sarawak Museum shows that the seasonal differences cannot be relied on much; thus a typical wet-season form was taken in July and another in June and a third in May; of the remainder, two taken in April and May have the white on the fore-wing of the dry-season but the hind-wing is typically wet-season; only two taken in June and August are typical of the dry-season, and the other five taken in January, April and October, are typical of the wet-season. Mr. Shelford suggests in explanation, \"that the colouring of the butterflies exhibiting seasonal changes is determined by the state of the weather during the early stages of the life-history, so that a wet August (for example) would produce the wet-season form, a dry August the dry-season form.\"\u00b2\n\n\u00b9. Mr. Shelford gives an interesting account of the butterflies of this mountain in Journal No. 35. Str. Br. Roy. Asiat. Soc. 1901, pp. 29-42. He notices the distinctive character of the fauna of Penrissen as shewn by his collections there, and at the same time comments on the unexpected scarcity of butterflies as compared with those found on the mountains near Kuching,\u2014Mts. Matang and Santubong. His small total of 9 species of Lycaenidae captured in one month's collecting is certainly illustrative of this; and my own experience there on a short trip in November 1909 was the same. (Mr. Shelford made his expedition there in May 1899.)\n\n\u00b2. l. c. p. 33.\n\nR. A.

In the Sarawak examples the general colour is a dull fuscous black, relieved discally in the fore-wing by an oblong patch of blueish-white slightly iridescent; the hind-wing similar, though the patch is much reduced.

First, the dark marginal band of the hind-wing can become quite broad as in Sarawak examples or reduced to a marginal row of dark spots as in Druce's figure. Again, the white on the upper surface of the hind-wing varies a good deal; Druce comments on one from Mt. Kina Balu (3,000 ft.) in which this white patch on the apex of the hind-wing has almost disappeared. In the Sarawak Museum specimens it is much reduced. All the Sarawak examples have a small dark spot over the cell on the underside of the hind-wing, which is not figured by Druce though he writes that the black spots are arranged much as in *placida*, which has this spot.\n\n311. *Lycaenopsis* (*Lycaenopsis*) *sonchus*, H.

He suggests however, that possibly he may not have had true *sonchus* to examine.\nDruce describes the species from a male only, but the single female in the Sarawak Museum differs so much from the female *plauta* that a brief description should be of interest; and for this reason I prefer to keep the two species distinct until further evidence to the contrary is forthcoming.\n\n**Upperside.** Ground-colour of dark fuscous-brown: with large white discal patches, which are lightly covered with pale-blue iridescent scales. **Fore-wing:** sharply defined discal patch begins at base of first median nervule, extends upwards into outer end of cell, continuing outwards to meet third median nervule 4 mm. from hind-margin, leaving a marginal border of ground colour, which diffuses slightly at inner margin. **Hind-wing:** costal margin of ground-colour reaching sub-costal nervure and extending along first sub-costal nervule towards apex; a broad hind-marginal band of ground-colour from a little below apex across to inner margin, occupying nearly a half of the wing. Hind-marginal border of inter-nervular dark fuscous round spots inwardly edged with a few light scales; remaining portion of the wing occupied by white discal patch.

There seems to be practically no variation, judging from the specimens I have examined.\"\n\nThere are only three examples in the Sarawak Museum, two from Mt. Penrissen after three weeks' arduous collecting in May 1900 by Messrs. Shelford and Cox together with four or five native collectors and a third taken near Kuching in August 1911; so that apparently it is not very plentiful in the Sarawak localities.\n\nR. A.

A larger dark spot on costa near apex, with very small spot immediately below; this post-discal series is continued by four spots shifted further outwards, but inclining inwards and growing larger towards the fourth (*i.e.*, sixth of the post-discal series). Hind-marginal border as in fore-wing. Cilia fuscous. Antennae black-brown ringed with white.

Mus.).\n\n*Type.* \u03b4 from Sarawak in British Museum; co-type in Sarawak Museum.\n\nThere is a single specimen in the Sarawak Museum very like the male of this species which I take to be its female. It differs in the following points:\n\n(i) the hind-marginal border on the upperside of fore-wing is continued evenly to costa, not broadened at apex as in male;\n\n(ii) the hind-marginal border of the hind-wing is broader than in the male;\n\n(iii) on the underside of hind-wing the last spot of the post-discal row is shifted further up the inner margin than in the male, so as to form a third spot to the basal row, rather than the last spot of the post-discal row;\n\n(iv) the spot in cell is rather more pronounced;\n\n(v) the colouring is the same, but the forewings are more rounded, not so pointed as in the male.\n\n*Exp. al.* \u2640 20 mm.; \u03b4 20-27 mm.\n\nThe male was taken fairly commonly near Kuching in March 1911.\n\n317. *Lycaenopsis matanga*, Chapman.\n\n*Lycaenopsis matanga*, Chapman, Trans.

Upperside.** Dark fuscous with discal region light green-blue. **Fore-wing:** the blue discal patch reaches from inner margin upwards to median nervure, and beyond third median nervule (but not in cell) to sub-costal nervure where it merges into the fuscous border, thus leaving a broad, even\u2014except for abrupt interruption at end of cell\u2014fuscous border from base through cell along costa and hind-margin. **Hind-wing:** broader fuscous margin from base along costa and hind-margin, slightly narrower along the inner margin enclosing a small discal patch of light green-blue scales. **Underside.** Grey-white. **Fore-wing:** costal, apical and upper hind-marginal region grey, remainder lighter. A slender fuscous line closing cell, a regular post-discal series of five internervular fuscous spots, the upper three very small (in another example these are obsolescent); no spot below the first median nervule; an outer border composed of lunular line, subterminal line of transverse spots and thin dark anteciliary line. **Hind-wing:** grey-white. Two very dark sub-basal spots, one below costal nervure and the other in cell; a slender line closing cell; a post-discal series of 8 spots, the first of which is large and dark and immediately below the costa, the second smaller and lighter\u2014below it, the third small and shifted outwards together with the fourth and fifth, the sixth larger and shifted in, the seventh shifted out and the eighth well in on the inner margin; an outer border of continuous lunular line followed by subterminal line of dark transverse spots and thin ante-ciliary line. Cilia fuscous. Antennae black, ringed with white. Head, thorax and abdomen above black-fuscous, below whitish.\n\n*Exp. al.* 29 mm.\n\n*Type.* Male. Matang Road, near Kuching, Sarawak (Sar. Mus.).\n\nA second example (the only other known)\u00b9 from Mt. Matang, Sarawak. This last measures 35 mm. across the wings.\n\nFore-wings pointed as in *L. matanga*, Chapman. The curious light green-blue of the upperside and the sharp interruption of fuscous border at the end of cell, give this species an appearance very distinct from any other Bornean or Indian Lycaenopsid.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 I am inclined to think that Dr. Chapman has described & figured two distinct species under the name *matanga*, although he notices no differences in the appendages. His description of a specimen with greenish-blue in fore-wing, extending beyond the cell, & of diminished markings on the unders'de of fore-wing, agrees well with my *delapra*, as does his fig. 1, which however is in no way like the co-type returned to me by Dr. Chapman. The six *matanga*, while agreeing well with one another, differ consistently on both upper & underside from the two *delapra*. I suggest that on comparison of all the specimens, my *delapra* will prove to be the same as the type of *matanga*, Chapman (now in the British Museum) and that the co-type of *matanga*, Chapman, will have to be regarded as a separate species under a new name.\n\nJour.

He points out that the name *otis*, Fab. has been used for two species viz: *indica*, Murray and *labradus*, Godt. with its vars. *sangra*, Moore, and *dryina*, Chapman. And of these species he proposes the generic (or sub-generic name of *Zizina*). Dr. Chapman points out \"the Fabrician description also rather favours *sangra* than *indica*,\" and the Sarawak examples agree well in markings with the example of *labradus* var. *sangra* as figured by Dr. Chapman (*l. c.* Pl.

The upperside fore-wing is dull violet narrowly margined with fuscous along the costa and broadly along the hind-margin, spreading across the apex; a broad fuscous costal margin in hind-wing, broadening gradually towards apex; a narrow hind-marginal fuscous border intensified by a row of dark internervular spots, inwardly light-edged and outwardly bordered by a white anteciliary line.

Druce\u00b9 suggested this course, but could not be certain without examining a specimen. In discussing kerriana he says (l.c.) \"the underside of the figure given in Rhop. Malay. appears to agree well with that of N. angusta but the upperside has a broader black outer margin.\" The Sarawak specimens have a very slightly narrower black margin than in Distant's figure, and the fuscous spots along the hind-wing are almost obsolete on the upperside. As these upperside marginal fuscous bands and markings are always slightly variable throughout this sub-family of Lycaenidae this small difference may be disregarded. The important markings on the underside agree remarkably well with both descriptions of kerriana by Distant and Bingham,\u00b2 and with Druce's description of angusta. Bingham (l.c.) remarks that the female is unknown, so I append a description of the single female in the Sarawak Museum.\n\nFemale. Upperside. Fuscous; discal portion lighter and relieved by bright iridescent blue. Fore-wing: fuscous ground-colour forming broad margin round a discal whitish patch. The upper boundary of this patch starts from base through middle of cell to a point a little short of half-way between end of cell and hind-margin, descends thence to the 2nd-median nervule whence it continues towards the inner margin about 1 millimetre nearer the base. The patch is dull at the base, but gradually becomes lighter towards the hind-margin. In the lightest part, above and below the third median nervule, are two fuscous spots, and slightly nearer the base, above and below the 2nd median nervule, is a similar pair of slightly larger spots. The whole discal patch is iridescent with brilliant light blue scales. Hind-wing: a lighter fuscous than in fore-wing; the markings from underside show through and give a slightly mottled appearance. From base along median nervure a few iridescent light blue scales. A hind-marginal border of brown spots between the nervules as mentioned in Distant's description of the male. Underside. Similar to that of male, except that the markings are perhaps rather more emphasized.\n\n\u00b9 Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond. p. 578 (1895).\n\u00b2 Fauna Brit. Ind.

Borneo, near Banjarmasin (Wahnes).\n\nDruce described and figured this species from a male (now in Mus. Staud.) the female being then unknown. The two examples in the Sarawak Museum are females and agree well\nwith Druce's description of the underside markings with the exception of this one small difference: in describing the white striae or bands, he says \"the 4th extends to the 2nd median nervule, and has a small spot each side of it close to the costa.\" In the Sarawak specimens the exterior of these two spots is wanting. The colour bordering the black anal spot in the hind-wing is more of an orange-brown hue than the yellow tint in Druce's figure. The upperside much resembles \u2640 elpis, except that the fuscous marginal band of the fore-wing is more pronounced towards the anal angle than in elpis.\n\nMr. Druce lately examined one of these for me and noted that it was \"probably the unknown female of virgulatus,\" thus supporting my conjecture.\n\n342.

Mus).\n\nDistribution: Ceylon.\n\nThis is the first record of this species for Borneo. The series in the Sarawak Museum agrees well with Col. Bingham's description in Fauna British India, except that he says the underside of the male is pale greyish-brown, whereas the Bornean males are dark greyish-brown, and in some cases as dark as the underside of *L. bochus*. The markings agree with the description. In the female the shape of the fuscous margin agrees well with Col. Bingham's description, though this fuscous margin is evidently less developed in the Bornean *coruscans*. Thus he says the outer margin of the blue area starts from the dorsum at three-fourths of its length from the base: but in the specimens before me, this blue area starts quite seven-eighths of the length of dorsum from the base. In the 10 females in the Sarawak Museum this fuscous border varies slightly in the amount of its development so that this discrepancy can hardly be worthy of specific distinction. Six out of eighteen come from the summit of Mt. Matang. These mountain forms have the striae rather less prominent.\n\n343. Lampides coerulea, Druce.\n\n*Cupido coerulea*, Druce, Proc. Zool. Soc.

Hist.* Sept. 1889, pp. 209-218) Mr. S. B. J. Sketchly notes that the following genera among the Lycaenidae \"alone supply true forest species, that never seek the sunny river-banks or bright glades and clearings:\" \u2014 *Nacaduba*, *Lampides*, *Biduanda* and *Narathura* (*Arhopala*). While this statement is generally true, I should add that I have met species of *Lampides* and an *Ambypodia* in open places along river-banks, and by no means infrequently have taken species of *Lampides*, *Arhopala* and *Biduanda* along sunny paths in low secondary jungle and in sunlit clearings. Mr. Sketchly continues:\u2014\"The more plentiful butterflies in the forest are the blues and purples, which frequent the higher undergrowth and have a strong tendency to settle in the middle of leaves which turn their upper surface horizontally. The purples perhaps, such as *Narathura*, are more arboreal than the blues and fly higher, even up to 60 feet; but as a rule the forest butterflies keep pretty low down.\"\n\nMr. Sketchly points out that his experiences in North Borneo do not confirm the suggestion \"that the rarity of butterflies in the deep forest shade is more apparent than real and that the mass of the individuals are high overhead on the tree-tops;\" and he remarks on their scarcity on cleared mountain tops where he had occasion to spend periods of several days together. My experience is very much the opposite of this: the greatest variety of species and quantity of individuals are to be found just on such cleared mountain-tops; in fact my *modus operandi*, when after butterflies, is to go up the nearest mountain, at once have a space on the top cleared, and here one may be almost certain of catching some highly interesting species, which are either very rare or never met with at all in the jungle below. These are to be seen flying over and among tree-tops in the jungle below and great is the excitement when some bright-hued stranger comes hurrying up the mountain-side\u2014to fly within reach of the net. or not?\n\nThe repeated mention of localities such as Mount Matang, Mount Lingga Mount Santubong, etc., etc., throughout this paper will bear me out in this statement, as the majority of species recorded from those localities were taken in the way described.\n\nJour.

Further research on this complex genus is much needed.\n\nThe following is a brief description of what I can only regard as a variety or form of *L. zebra*, though the differences are really greater than those noticed between some other \"species (?)\" of this difficult genus.\n\n349a. var. *lawasa*, nov.\n\n*Upperside*: as in typical *L. zebra*, except that in the forewing there is a dark fuscous marginal border starting with a line at anal angle and broadening out to the apex, where it slightly diffuses on reaching costa; the inner end of this border is serrate. In the hind-wing there is a marginal row of black spots outwardly bordered with white between each nervule, that between the 2nd and 1st median nervule being the largest. This line of spots is succeeded exteriorly by a thin black line more pronounced than in *zebra*.\n\n*Underside*: much as in *zebra*, but the third white mark from base is not so straight; and the 5th and 6th are closer together and more lunulate. In the hind-wing the first and second striae are very slightly more apart, the 4th is closer to the 3rd, and the 5th and 6th, as in fore-wing, are much more lunulate.\n\nDescribed from three males in the Sarawak Museum, taken near Lawas, August and September, 1909.\n\n350. *Lampides lividus*, H.

Godman and Salvin's collection, was unique. However in 1896 he examined another male from Staudinger's collection, taken on Kina Balu by Waterstradt.

A very thin dark line outwardly limits the hind-marginal border. *Cilia* light fuscous. *Hind-wing*: pale blueish-white as in fore-wing, but no hind-marginal border except very thin dark line from apex to anal angle ending at sub-median nervure.\n\n**Underside.** Light brown fuscous marked with transverse white lines or striae. *Fore-wing*: six transverse white lines arranged as follows:\u2014the first formed by a slender white fascia closing the cell, following below and slightly shifted inwards, a short outwardly oblique fascia from junction of 2nd median nervule to first median nervule, and immediately below this but slightly shifted inwards, another outwardly oblique fascia. The second line runs parallel and exterior to this composite line; the second fascia is longitudinally divided into two and is immediately exterior to the fascia cell, the third fascia rather thick, fourth and fifth continuous, sixth slightly shifted inwards and joining at end with first and third lines. A rather broad strip of ground-colour between 2nd and 3rd lines, of which the latter is continuous from costa to end of 2nd; the 4th very close to 3rd and composed of four lunules, the last of which practically fuses with the 3rd line between 2nd and 3rd median nervules. The 5th and 6th lines continuous and parallel from apex to anal angle, the 5th line being slightly lunulate. A thin dark line completes the hind-margin. *Cilia* white, outwardly touched with fuscous. *Hind-wing*: ground-colour as in fore-wing with with the following white lines: two parallel lines from costal nervure across centre of cell to median-nervure, a short one continued to inner margin; a third line from costal nervure to\ninner margin, of which the first fascia is outwardly oblique and disconnected, the second closer cell, third inwardly oblique and continuous, fourth split and triangulate, the fourth and fifth lines run parallel from apex to anal angle; of which the first fascia of the forth line is shifted outwards so as to join the second fascia of the fifth line while the first fascia of that line is almost obsolete: the 2nd and 3rd fascia of the fifth line are slightly split longitudinally. The sixth line very lunulate, the seventh thin and continuous as in fore-wing. Cilia as in fore-wing. At anal angle between 1st and 2nd median nervules a dark spot laterally touched with iridescent light green scales and inwardly margined with dark orange; a thin fuscous and white filamentous tail.\n\n*Exp. al. 25 mm.*\n\n*Type, Male*, Quop, Sarawak (Sar.

Family III. CURETHINAE.\n\nGenus, *Curetis*, H\u00fcbner.\n\nThis genus has provided much material for discussion on the relative values of the species described under its name; and to quote\n\n---\n\n1. The upperside colouring in both species is a plain but striking pattern of black surrounding a broad discal white band across both wings. In the underside they differ widely: *haraldus* is a somewhat typical *Lycaenopsis* form, while the pattern of *elna* is the typical black and white blotched pattern of *Castalius*.\n\n2. The only other suggestion of mimicry among Bornean Lycaenidae, that I can find comes from Mr. Shelford, who regards *Thrix gama* as a mimic of *Eoozygides tharis*, and the two species, *Poritia plateni* and *Araotes lapithis* as mimics of the common species, *Drupadia boisdualii* var. *atra* and *Biduanda thesmia*. In commenting thereon, he writes, \"I am, however, quite certain that *E. tharis*, *D. boisdualii* and *B. thesmia* are distasteful species, whilst the great rarity of the mimicking species points to the conclusion that they are Batesian mimics.\" *Proc. Zool. Soc. Loral. 1902, p. 263*.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 60, 1911.\nCol. Bingham, \"until extensive breeding experiments are undertaken it will be impossible to attain any certainty as to whether there are two or a dozen distinct forms.\" In treating the Indian species, this authority divides them into two species only, and I have endeavoured to treat the Bornean forms in a similar way.\n\nCol. Bingham separates the two species thus:\n\nA. \u2642 \u2640. Underside fore-wing: discal and subterminal markings or bands parallel, not anteriorly convergent = *C. thetis*.\n\nB. \u2642 \u2640.

Mus.).\n\nThe position of C. aesopus, Fabr., seems to me rather doubtful. First of all Bingham says of it: \u201cWith regard to C. aesopus, Fabr., that also falls as a synonym of C. thetis, as acknowledged by Fabricius himself. The type, a \u2640, is in the Banksian collection now in the British Museum, and is undoubtedly a \u2640 of ordinary C. thetis, Drury.\u201d De Nic\u00e9ville supports this view having bred females exactly like aesopus from thetis.\n\nNow in order to completely fulfil Bingham\u2019s definition of C. thetis the underside fasciae must be parallel; but in Distant\u2019s description of aesopus he says \u201canterior wings with a palish blue oblique lunulated fascia, etc.\u201d and his figures, \u2642 and \u2640, show typical bulis underside with convergent fasciae. He too says he has compared his specimens with Fabricius\u2019 type. So the position is this: the author of aesopus admits that his own species (aesopus) is the same as thetis; de Nic\u00e9ville breeds aesopus from thetis; Bingham says of aesopus \u201cundoubtedly female of ordinary C. thetis, Drury.\u201d Kirby and Moore also adopt this view. On the other side is Distant, who examines Fabricius\u2019 type and then figures a specimen with typical bulis underside, though he treats aesopus as a distinct species; and Butler supports this view.\n\nSix \u2642 examples in the Sarawak Museum agree well with Distant\u2019s description and figure for the upperside, but on the underside the two lines of fasciae are not nearly so convergent; though they cannot be called strictly parallel as in typical thetis. From the three forms in the Sarawak Museum it\nseems that aesopus is intermediate between thetis and bulis; de Nic\u00e9ville comments on the upperside markings forming a connecting link and I think the underside markings bear that out too.\n\nThe following are the characteristics of the three Sarawak Museum forms (only males compared):\n\n(i) **Upperside**: inner-marginal black border forms a strongly curved arch: the ends of which form an even edging along the costa, and along the hind-margin from 1st median nervule to anal angle. The actual edge of this black margin is slightly irregular, in no two specimens alike, though the general impression is that of an evenly rounded arch. No extension of black along inner margin.\n\n**Underside**: fasciae parallel\n\n= C. thetis, Drury, form nesophila, Feld.\n\n(ii) **Upperside**: black marginal border heavier; at a point less than a quarter of the length of costa from the base, the black begins to broaden, extending unevenly to end of cell and across to 2nd median nervule thus forming an angulated inner edge to this marginal border; thence it extends evenly, but twice as broad as in nesophila, to anal angle, where it becomes diffuse along a small part of the inner margin.\n\n**Underside**: fasciae not quite parallel, but suggesting the anterior convergence of typical bulis = form aesopus, Fab.\n\n(iii) **Upperside**: marginal border more heavily developed; inner edge rather more angular and from 1st median nervule to half way along inner margin the border is developed into an anal patch.\n\n**Underside**: fasciae sharply convergent\n\n= C. bulis, Doubl. and Hew. form, malayica, Feld.\u00b9\n\n367. *Curetis bulis*, Doubl. and Hew.\n\n*Anops bulis*, Doubleday and Hewitson, Gen.

These, and other suggestions as to nomenclature throughout this paper, being founded on the examination of Bornean specimens only, are intended to serve as material for any future Monograph of Eastern Lycaenidae, rather than presuming to correct the views of other authors of far greater experience and ability than the present writer.\n\nJour.

The females agree well with Distant\u2019s figure in *Rhopalocera Malayana*; but are more heavily marked than the female figured by de Nic\u00e9ville.\n\nThe only point to remark is that Bingham says:\u2014\"specimens from Malacca and south and east through the sub-region have a decreasing amount of black colouring on the upperside.

(Fig. 2).\n\n**Male.** Upperside. Exactly like preceding species (*P. pharyge*, Hew.) in every detail. Underside. Dull fuscous brown. Fore-wing: two almost imperceptible light thin parallel lines traverse the lower portion of the wing, one hind-marginal and the other discal; these two lines are continued a little more distinctly in hind-wing; the hind-marginal line becomes a little whiter towards anal angle, and is outwardly edged with dark fuscous. The discal line remains parallel to hind-margin and joins the inner margin at end of abdomen. Below the 3rd and 2nd median nervules on this line are two dark brown spots; below 1st median nervule is a trace of another.\n\n**Female.** Upperside. Uniform dark fuscous; cilia light. Underside. Dull ochreous fuscous; basal region very slightly darker and bordered by dark ochreous line from centre of costa to centre of inner margin in fore-wing and continued across centre of hind-wing. A thin light line darkened on each side, runs parallel to hind-margin in both wings some 5 mm, from discal line and 3 mm, from hind-margin, slightly curved inwards towards costa of fore-wing. In the hind-wing, the discal line is made prominent by two ochreous guttulate spots below 3rd and 2nd median nervules as in the male. The shape of the hind-margin distinguishes it from other species\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nof *Poritia*, being sharp at apex, then curved in slightly to third median nervule which, together with the second and first median nervules, is slightly prolonged, thus giving an angulate appearance to the wing.

Lustrous blue-purple with narrow even fuscous hind-marginal borders, a little broader at apex of forewing, more so across apex of hind-wing; costal margin of forewing very narrowly fuscous, of hind-wing more than twice as broad; inner-marginal fold of hind-wing grey fuscous, a thin indistinct white line bordering the anal angle; dark fuscous tail white-tipped. Underside. Brown with an iridescent lilac tinge, particularly noticeable in the hind-wing. The white edging to the spots well pronounced; general appearance of the underside like *A. ariel*, Doherty, but the individual markings quite different. Fore-wing: three cell spots well defined and in increasing sizes; below the 2nd and 3rd are two irregular half-formed spots; above the second and slightly interior another small spot; small minute white spots above the third cell spot suggesting an irregular continuation of that spot to the costa; a well-defined transverse band of 6 spots: the 1st very small, 2nd, 3rd and 4th fused and sloping outwards, the 5th and 6th shifted well in and sloping outwards; hind-\nmarginal border composed of a row of lunular spots succeeded exteriorly by an anteciliary white line; inner marginal region pale brown-fuscous. Hind-wing: a large costal-basal spot; four large basal spots, the third and fourth shifted outwards, the first three connected; a discal row of three large conterminous spots, the costal spot being fused with the first of a post-discal transverse row; a large spot closing cell and almost touching the 3rd and 4th spots of the post-discal row; a small half-formed spot immediately below it; the first four spots of the transverse row are placed en \u00e9chelon outwards, the fifth shifted well in, the sixth out, the seventh or anal spot, long and irregular, reaching inner margin. Hind-marginal row of spots as in fore-wing but rather larger and the three anal spots are touched inwardly with blue iridescent scales; white anteciliary line as in fore-wing. Cilia grey-fuscous.\n\nFemale. Upperside. Violet-purple, with dark narrow margin to costa of fore-wing broadening across apex and continuing broadly along hind-margin to inner margin; in hindwing the base and discal region violet-purple surrounded by broad fuscous borders. A short tail, brown-fuscous, white-tipped. Underside colour and markings as in male, except for the addition of a seventh spot, small and indistinct, in the post-discal transverse band of the fore-wing.\n\nExp. al. \u2642 33 mm., \u2640 28 mm.\n\nTypes. Male: near Kuching, Sarawak, June 1911. Female: Sarawak, 1910 (Sar. Mus.) examined by Messrs. Druce and Bethune-Baker, who report the species as unknown to them.\n\nIn addition to the Types there are two females in the Sarawak Museum, captured near Kuching in 1900 and 1910, and a male from the ulu Madihit (head waters of the Limbang River), Sarawak, May 1911.\n\n429. *Arhopala eumolpus*, Cr.\n\n*Papilio eumolpus*, Cramer, Pap.

Soc., No. 60, 1911.\nThe males in the Sarawak Museum present a good deal of variation in the underside markings; the spots in the majority are rather larger than in the specimens figured by Bethune-Baker.\\(^1\\) In one example the spots are so large that the transverse band of the fore-wing is partly fused with the third cell-spot and the spot beneath, suggestive of *staudingeri*, Semper. The hind-wing however does not show the same fusion of spots. Bethune-Baker's figures of the male *eumolpus* do not show the costal-basal spot which is present in the hind-wing of all the Sarawak males.\n\nThe males are fairly common in the neighbourhood of Kuching. Four females have been examined by Mr. Druce, who suggests that they represent the *farquhari* form of this species.\n\n**Injuries.** (i) \u2642, a ragged bite cutting out tail portion of right hind-wing. (ii) \u2642, a square piece from apex of left fore-wing removed. (iii) \u2642, a large tearing bite removing the whole of the anal angle of right hind-wing, but leaving a central strip in a similarly outlined gap in the left hind-wing. (iv) \u2640, a small quadrate piece removed from hind-margin of right fore-wing.\n\n430. *Arhopala aurea*, Hew.\n\n*Amblypodia aurea*, Hewitson, Cat. Lyc. B. M. p. 8, pl.

Brass-green, with hind-marginal borders of black, very narrow in the fore-wing, very heavy in the hind-wing. Fore-wing: the costa edged with black, narrow hind-marginal border tapering from anal angle to apex. Hind-wing: base and discal region brass-green, extending just above the sub-costal nervure and below the median, thus leaving dark broad costal and inner margins, and a broad hind-margin covering the outer two-fifths of the wing. Short black tail white-tipped. Long dark fuscous hairs along the inner margin.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bethune-Baker (*l.c.*) describes a male under the female sign; doubtless a printer's error.\nUnderside. Dark grey fuscous. Fore-wing: first discal spot indistinct, 2nd elongate right across cell, third large. The transverse band unbroken but angled at the 4th spot as in *basiviridis*, de Nic\u00e9v., the 5th spot being shifted well in, the 6th slightly out again and the 7th immediately beneath almost obsolete and enclosed in a light grey patch which reaches from the outer half of inner margin to 1st median nervule. A distinct sub-marginal row of spots the upper three of which are slightly shifted inwards. Hind-wing: indistinct costal-basal spot, regular basal row composed of four well-formed spots; median row of three spots, the two first well-defined, the third large and irregular; a transverse band of two confluent spots below the costa, followed by one elongate and slightly shifted in closing to the end of cell, this last succeeded outwardly by a smaller elongate spot, which is the first of an irregular series of confluent spots continuing the band to the inner margin; a rough sub-marginal row ending at anal angle in bright blue iridescent scales outwardly touched with black. Cilia fuscous.\n\nFemale. Upperside. Purple, heavily margined with dark fuscous. Fore-wing: the dark costal margin extends along the sub-costal nervure, partially closes the cell and stretching across the radials and 3rd median nervule, leaves a broad fuscous apical region and an even margin 4-5 mm. wide from 2nd median nervule to inner margin. Hind-wing: margined as in male except that the purple disc (brass-green in male) extends rather more towards the hind-margin; tail twice as long as in male. Underside. Bronze-fuscous. Markings as in male, except that the discal spots of the fore-wing are rather heavier.\n\n*Exp. al.* \u03b4 41 mm., \u2640 47 mm.\n\nTypes, \u03b4 and \u2640. Kuching (Sar. Mus.).\n\nMessrs.

One specimen has the 5th spot of the fore-wing transverse band less shifted in than in the typical form, so that the spots form an arched, but continuous, band;\nthe other wing of the same specimen shows this even better, thus indicating that too much reliance should not be placed on so variable a character as this transverse band.\n\nInjury. \\( \\delta \\), large piece removed from hind-margin of right hind-wing, just missing the tail.\n\n434. *Arhopala abseus*, Hew.\n\n*Amblypodia abseus*, Hewitson, Cat.

They are uniform in markings and colour; the wonderful rich hue of the male upperside colouring makes this species one of the most beautiful Arhopalas to be found in Borneo,\u2014Bethune-Baker thinks \u201cabout the most magnificent of the genus,\u201d but his figure of the male gives no idea of \u201cthe intense richness of the deep ultramarine blue\u201d (*l. c.*). He remarks on the rarity of the species.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 60, 1911.\nInjury.\u00b9 \u2640, large asymmetrical bite removing anal portion of both hind-wings.\n\n[In comparison with the more or less uniform injuries noticed among the Theclinae it is interesting to reflect on the diverse nature of the injuries seen in the Arhopalinae, in which species all parts of the wings have been attacked both in flight and at rest; this no doubt is due to the absence of any very prominent markings directing attention to a non-vital part. The majority of the injuries are in one side only, suggesting that they are principally attacked when in flight, thus showing that their protectively coloured undersides have a real value and stand them in good stead.]\n\n440. *Arhopala bazalus*, Hew.\n\n*Amblypodia bazalus*, Hewitson, Cat.

Rather narrow sub-acute fore-wings as in *A. buddha*, Bethune-Baker. **Fore-wing:** the discal region of lustrous purple is sharply defined by the fuscous border, which follows the sub-costal nervure, closes the cell and stretches across diagonally and rather irregularly, to form an even hind-marginal border 3 millim. in width and slightly diffuse along inner margin. A dark spot is noticeable at the end of cell. **Hind-wing:** long, bright purple discal patch, sharply defined as in fore-wing but more restricted in area,\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nextending from base through cell and beyond it, including the basal third of the 2nd and 3rd median nervules and bounded by the 1st median nervule. Rest of the hind-wing brown fuscous. A short stout tail at the end of 1st median nervule; hind-margin just above this tail suggestive of being scoloped.\n\n*Underside.* Brown, glossed with a beautiful lilac sheen, particularly so in the hind-wing, with clear, large, decisive markings. *Fore-wing:* three increasing spots in cell; a large spot, outwardly light-edged, below junction of 1st median nervule; a second, similar but smaller, below junction of 2nd median nervule. A broad continuous band of six large fused spots, the first four sloping outwards slightly and increasing in size, the 5th shifted in, the 6th out; there are indistinct traces of 7th and 8th spots. A well-defined hind-marginal line of spots followed by a thin light anteciliary line; inner marginal region to 1st median nervule light fuscous-brown. *Hind-wing:* small costal-basal spot; sub-basal row of four spots, the 2nd and 3rd of which are contiguous; a median row of three larger spots; a long spot closing cell; a spot in angle just above the junction of 1st median nervule and touching the 3rd sub-basal spot. Much interrupted transverse row of 7 large spots; the 1st and 2nd large and fused, 3rd and 4th fused and shifted well out so that the inner corner of the 3rd only just touches the outer lower corner of the 2nd, and 5th smaller and shifted well in, the 6th shifted out, and the 7th, or angular spot, shifted in and prolonged to the inner margin. A hind-marginal row of continuous spots outwardly edged with lightish lunules; a thin light anteciliary line; at anal angle:\u2014a large black spot, inwardly edged with light iridescent blue, between 1st and 2nd median nervules, succeeded inwardly by two fused spots at the angle, the first of which is light iridescent blue edged with black, the second black inwardly edged with iridescent blue. Tail dark fuscous white tipped; cilia dark fuscous, except for a few white scales at anal angle of hind-wing.\n\n*Exp. al.* 37 mm.\n\n*Type* \u2642 (and only known specimen), Mt. Lingga, Sarawak, May 1909 (Sar. Mus.).\n\nMessrs. Bethune-Baker and Druce, who kindly examined it, reported it as unknown to them, but allied to *A. buddha*, a Javan species. The shape of *A. rajah* is like this species, but the pale azure-blue of *buddha* together with the narrower margins at once provide sufficient distinctions between the two species. The underside markings are also different.\n\n453. *Arhopala caeca*, Hew.\n\n*Amblypodia caeca*, Hewitson, Ill. Diurn. Lep. Lyc. p. 14, pl.

THECLINAE.\n\nThe Bornean *Theclinae* seem to fall naturally into five groups which may be characterized as follows:\n\n1. Hind-wing with one short filamentous tail. 1. *Chrysophanaria*.\n2. Hind-wing with two short filamentous tails, (the Indian genus, *Zesius*, belongs here, although the female is aberrant in having three tails). 2. *Bicaudataria*.\n3. Hind-wing both sexes with two tails, one of which is half an inch in length or over. 3. *Cheritraria*.\n4. Hind-wing both sexes with three tails. 4. *Horagaria*.\n5. Hind-wing with one tail of variable length; lobate at anal angle. 5. *Loxuraria*.\n\nThis classification is practically the same as that proposed by de Nic\u00e9ville in his *Butterflies of India*. He divided the *Lycaenidae* into eleven groups of which the group *Thecla* is the sixth. This, he sub-divided into two sub-groups, the first containing six genera \"which, as a rule, possess one short tail to the hind-wing from the termination of the first median nervule;\" this sub-group I have called *Chrysophanaria*, since it contains the well-known genus, *Chrysophanus*, H\u00fcbner. The only Bornean representative of this sub-group (promoted to the rank of group here) is *Ilerda kiana*, Gr.-Smith. De Nic\u00e9ville's second sub-group contained twelve genera \"which all possess two short tails (under half an inch in length) to the hind-wing in both sexes, though one aberrant genus, *Zesius*, H\u00fcbner, from India has three tails in the female;\" this sub-group (or group here) I call *Bicaudataria*.\n\nThe remaining three groups are almost the same as those of de Nic\u00e9ville, except that I have merged his *Deudorix* group into the *Loxuraria* group.\n\n**Group 1.

In regard to the position of this genus, Distant placed it between *Cheritra* and *Neomyrina*; de Nic\u00e9ville referred it to his *Thecla Group*, placing it next to *Tajuria*. Druce suggested it was more likely to be related to *Cheritra*, and the discovery of the male with secondary sexual characters helps to bear this out. De Nic\u00e9ville judged from Distant\u2019s figure that the tails were not long enough for inclusion in his *Myrina Group*, hence his reason for reference to the *Thecla Group*.\n\nHowever the inner tails of the Sarawak examples reach the required half-inch, so I include it now in the *Myrina (Cheritaria, mihi)* Group.\n\n---\n\n**Genus, Manto, de Nic\u00e9v.**\n\n493. *Manto martina*, Hew.\n\n*Myrina martina*, Hewitson, Ill.

Soc., No. 60, 1911.\nDruce records a single female which differs from the Indian species *C. mandarinus*, Hew., \"by having a greater area of white on the hind-wing above and by the yellow on the hind-wing below being nearly all replaced by white; the black angular markings and spots towards the anal angle are larger and more prominent, so it may possibly represent a different species, but until the male is discovered it is impossible to be certain.\" (l. c.).\n\nA fine male was taken near Kuching in March 1911, which differs from the male *mandarinus* in a similar way, so that I have adopted Mr. Druce's suggestion and proposed a new name for the Bornean form.\n\nThe male differs from Hewitson's species on the upperside in the following points:\u2014(i) on the upperside of fore-wing the blue area does not extend as far up the cell as depicted in de Nic\u00e9ville's figure,\u00b9 nor does it reach the first median nervule\u00b2; (ii) de Nic\u00e9ville's figure shows a black mark below the first median nervule which is totally absent in *splendida*; (iii) on the underside of fore-wing the post-discal band is succeeded by a broad hind-marginal band of uniform rufous brown, unrelieved by a dark submarginal line as figured by de Nic\u00e9ville for *mandarinus*; (iv) the anal region of the hind-wing is white, not yellow (thus agreeing with Druce's description of the female) and (v) the black markings of anal region are distinctly heavier, that nearest the inner-margin being a straight bar, not irregular as shown in de Nic\u00e9ville's figure.\n\n*Injury.* \u03b4, a small triangular excision at anal angle of right hind-wing removing the outer tail.

Thus anasuja occurs in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra; jusana and metasuja in Borneo, the former from Sandakan to Sarawak and the latter on Mt. Kina Balu only. A male in the Sarawak Museum has a thin blue apical band intermediate in width between these last two species.\n\nInjuries.

XXVIII, fig. 213), the outer of which from the 1st median nervule is 6 mm. long, the inner from sub-median nervure is 5 mm.

The Sarawak example has a third short filamentous tail at the end of the submedian nervure (the two other tails are from first and second median nervules) I have carefully compared the neuration with that of *C. elegans*, and I have no doubt that its inclusion in this genus is correct.\n\n513. *Catapoecilma elegans*, Druce.\n\n*Hypochrysops elegans*, Druce, Proc.

This is nicely demonstrated by a long series of males and females in the Sarawak Museum, in which the prominent orange discal patch of var. *atra* becomes smaller and smaller reaching the final stage of obsolescence in typical *moorei*. The undersides are exactly similar in all specimens male and female.\n\nIf this view is correct, this species affords a parallel case of variation to that of *Buduanda thesmia*, (see p. 162).\n\n**Injuries.** (i) \u2642, anal angle of right hind-wing bitten off.

Soc., Lond., 1905, p. 90 et id. 1908, p. 658) notes of this species in Calcutta, \u201cits wings are much plaited longitudinally, and when at rest its extremely long tails, crumpled look, and brown colour give it quite the appearance of a dead leaf.\u201d\n\nMy experience of it in Sarawak is rather different. I first saw it beside a small sunny path at Lawas, and on and off for the next three weeks between the hours of 9 a.m. and midday I met with two or three (never more) individuals in this one spot\u2014, but never elsewhere in collecting round the station at Lawas. I frequently noticed how conspicuous it was by reason of its short weak flight in the sunshine and its habit of settling on the upperside of leaves: its ochreous yellow underside rendering it thus conspicuous rather than the reverse, and the conspicuous lightness of its long tails at once destroyed any chance of a resemblance to a dead leaf. The wings were folded erect, in no way \u201cplaited\u201d; the tails together, not folded; in fact, the insect gave me the general idea of being a conspicuously coloured unpalatable insect, not a procrystically coloured palatable butterfly. Curiously enough Dr. Longstaff (l.c. 1908, p. 629) mentions an experiment with a closely allied species, Loxura arcuata, which tends to support my suggestion. He gave some butterflies to two Mainas in Ceylon some of which the birds ate with evident relish, others they tasted and then showed signs of dislike. Of the Loxura he notes: \u201cThe bird gave the Loxura a few pecks and then let it alone,\u201d suggesting unpalatability.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 60, 1911.\nLehera anna, \u2640 H. H Druce, Proc. Zool.

Hind-wing: same colour as in fore-wing, with narrow fuscous border along the costa; broader fuscous border along inner margin \"thickly clothed with long fur-like modified scales\" (as de Nic\u00e9ville notes in _Lehera eryx_, \u2642). Anal lobe metallic green (in some gold-green) slightly extending up inner margin. Underside, emerald-green.\n\n_Fore-wing:_ indistinct white line from costa to inner margin rather nearer to hind-margin than in female. White patch along inner margin does not extend above submedian nervure as figured in female. Hind-wing: indistinct discal band as in female followed exteriorly by another similarly indistinct light band, two small white marks at base of anal lobe, which is itself jet black. Tail very thin filamentous, dark fuscous white-tipped. This last feature is in curious contrast to the long and stout white tails of the female.\n\n_Injury._ \u2642, large jagged bite removing anal region of left hind-wing.\n\n530a.

Santubong; taken all the year round; varying in size from 25 mm. to 41 mm. The basal spots on underside of hind-wing are not so filled up as shewn in de Nic\u00e9ville's figure of the female. The blue areas of both wings are much more reduced than in the female, as pointed out by Druce.\n\nInjuries. Small ragged bites out of anal angle of left hind-wing in two specimens; a third with symmetrical bite from both hind-wings at anal angle and a fourth with a small piece removed from the same region of the right hind-wing.\n\nAs this is the last instance of injured Lycaenidae to be noticed it may be of interest to try and draw some conclusions from all the instances so far recorded in this paper.\n\nIt will have been noticed that the Sub-Families of Lycaenidae show signs of enemies' bites in varying degrees culminating in the two extremes shown by the Gerydinae and Theclinae: the former showing practically no injuries at all, while in sharp contrast to them, the latter afford abundant evidence of attacks made by birds or lizards, sometimes on the hind-margin of the hind-wing, sometimes even on the fore-wing, but more especially on the anal region of the hind-wings. From this, two pairs of diametrically opposite conclusions are suggested: (i) that the small, weak, protectively coloured (above and below) Gerydinae fall so easy a prey to their enemies, that no injured specimens ever escape; one bite and the incident of capture is over. Their only chance in the struggle for existence lies in their ability to escape notice, and hence we have the sombre coloured uppersides, which render them very hard to see in flight, and the procrystic undersides which answer their purpose as well as, if not better than, those of any other Lycaenid. This would be in accordance with the view that protectively-coloured butterflies are always palatable.\n\n[Against this conclusion however we should note that one frequently catches injured specimens of the presumably palatable Satyrine\u2014Ypthima pandacus, Moore, which is weak in flight and easy to capture: in fact I have more notes of injuries to that species than to any other in Sarawak!].\n\nWith the Theclinae it would appear that in lieu of any scheme of protective colouring, a different method of defence has been evolved, namely that of directing the enemy's attention to a non-vital spot, which is effected by the development of eye-spots and\ntails at the anal angle of the hind-wing.\\(^1\\) Thus, the enemy's attention is attracted by these showy spots and light tails, so that a dart is made in their direction rather than in the vital region of the head or body; but the loss of a portion of the hind-wing is of little moment to the butterfly, who thus escapes. The finding of so many *Theclinae* injured in this manner leads to the second part of our first conclusion, namely that this kind of Lycaenid is recognized among birds and lizards as palatable food, hence the evidence of numerous attacks, of which no doubt a certain percentage prove fatal.\n\n(ii) The 1st of our second pair of conclusions suggested is that put forward now again by opponents of the Mimicry Theories, viz. that butterflies are not attacked thus: there are no injured specimens among the *Gerydinae* because birds and lizards do not attack them. Why then we ask, their beautifully protected colouring? Are they unpalatable, and so immune from attacks? Again, if so, why their sombre colouring and why do we not get conspicuously coloured *Gerydinae*?\n\nThe second conclusion suggested by the evidence of the *Theclinae*, is that they are unpalatable and that their would-be destroyers (principally young and inexperienced enemies) on tasting them have given up the pursuit because of their unpalatability, thus accounting for the number of \"sampled\" specimens noticed.\\(^2\\)\n\nIt is altogether beyond the scope of the present paper to go into a discussion of this interesting problem, which would involve a lengthy review of all the external evidence collected by various writers on this and other Families of *Rhopalocera* in many other parts of the world, and it must suffice now to point out that the evidence on the whole favours our first pair of conclusions, although there are also published records apparently in support of the second pair of conclusions.\n\nBut like most of these curious theories, experiments and observations are wanted badly, be it either to confute or corroborate; and it is admittedly \"up\" to those of us who live in the tropics to provide the evidence of such experiments and observations.\n\n---\n\n1. For a lucid exposition of this theory see Poulton in *Essays on Evolution* 1908. pp. 281-3 and 325; also Shelford, *Journ. Str. Br. Roy. As. Soc.* No. 35, 1901. pp. 34, 35; also Marshall, *Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond.* 1902. pt. 353\u2014375 and plates IX, X and XI.\n\nA different conclusion is arrived at by A. Tylor (*Colouration of Animals and Plants*, 1886. p. 22), whose theory is (i) that coloration is primarily dependent upon the direct action of light, and (ii) that coloration follows the chief lines of structure. He states that \"It is not suggested that the coloration is applied to important parts in order to emphasize them, but rather that being important parts, they have become naturally the seats of most vivid colour.\"\n\nAccording to the theory of Directive Markings however, the conspicuous coloration at the anal angle of the hind-wing in *Theclinae* has been developed for that very purpose, i.e., in order to emphasize them, because they are not important parts. Mr. Tylor notes further on, that Natural Selection acts on his fundamental theory \"by suppressing, or developing, structurally distributed colours.\"\n\n2. See note on page 86.\n\nR. A.

Nos. 57, 58, 59, and 60, and the new edition of the Map of the Malay Peninsula, delayed for so long, was at last published and arrived here in August.\n\nThe cost of the map was as follows:\n\nA. Mr. van Cuylenberg's charge for compiling and drawing of the map ... ... ... $500\u2014\nB. E. Stanford's charge for Lithographing and Printing 2000 copies ... \u00a3296:\u2014:\n   Mounting 800 copies on rollers \u00a3240:\u2014:\n   Mounting 100 copies to fold... \u00a337:10:\u2014\n   \u00a3573:10: = $4915.71\nC. freight to Singapore ... $42.\u2014\n\nTOTAL $5457.71\n\nMessrs. Kelly and Walsh were appointed local agents for the sale of the map, and 358 copies were sold up to the end of December, the Society's share on this being $2486.40. (N. B. The balance sheet shows the sales up to the end of September only.)\n\nThe following new members were elected during the year:\n\nMR. W. R. ARMSTRONG.\n,, T. W. CLAYTON.\nRT. REV. BISHOP C. J.

WORSLEY-TAYLOR.\nThe Society deeply regrets to have to record the death of two of their members, that of the Hon'ble W. D. Barnes, of whom an obituary notice was given in Journal No. 60, and that of Mr. W. Nanson. Mr. Nanson was one of the oldest members of the Society. He was elected in 1889 and served repeatedly on the Council.\n\nMr. H. N. Ridley, C.M.G., F.R.S., resigned the Secretaryship in October, in view of his approaching retirement. Having been elected in 1888, he had been Secretary during the years 1890-93; 1897-1900; 1902-11, i.e., during the greater part of the Society's existence, and not in any way in a formal capacity, but as the very soul of the Society.\n\nThe Society is much indebted to its President, the Hon. Dr. Galloway, for having kindly presented the enlarged portrait of Mr. Ridley, which has now been placed in the Society's room alongside that of Bishop Hose, also presented by Dr. Galloway some years ago.\n\nR.

Ridley.\n\nThis paper is a continuation of the previous series of descriptions of new plants of our region chiefly from the Malay Peninsula, the specimens of which are preserved in the Singapore Gardens Herbarium. Some are plants which have been collected some years ago but not previously described, others have been recently collected by myself in various expeditions, or sent by collectors.\n\nTernstroemiaceae.\n\n*Sarauja (\u00a7 Cauliflores) rubens, n. sp.*\n\nA large shrub or small tree about 20 ft. tall glabrous, leaves oblanceolate narrowed gradually to the base and decurrent on the petiole broadest in the upper part, shortly acute, rather thin textured, nerves 14 pairs, dark above, a little paler beneath, margins entire, 9 inches long \u00bc inches wide, petiole 1\u00bd inch long. Flowers in clusters on the base of the trunk numerous on pedicels 2 inches long. Buds bright rose pink. Calyx lobes ovate orbicular rounded deep rose pink \u00bc inch long. Petals ovate orbicular white. Stamens about 20 free from the corolla. Anthers oblong opening by pores. Ovary glabrous, not scaly. Styles 3 united for half their length.\n\nSelangor: Semangkok Pass, at the foot of the hill leading to the Sempang mines.\n\nThis belongs to the group of Saraujas which bear the flowers in tufts on the stems and is allied to *S. cauliflora*, Bl. differing in its glabrousness, the bright cherry red sepals and buds, free stamens, and connate styles.\n\n*Eurya acuminata var. monticola.*\n\nSmall tree 20-30 feet tall, branches and young leaves silky hairy. Leaves entire coriaceous, apex shortly acuminate quite blunt, base rounded or slightly narrowed, \u00be-2 inches long, \u00bd-\u00be inches wide, drying greenish above yellowish beneath, above glabrous beneath nerves and midrib hairy. Flowers nearly glabrous, buds ovoid obtuse. Sepals and petals as in type form. Styles connate for \u2154 of their length.\n\nPahang: Gunong Berembun (No. 13909); Perak: Gunong Kerbau (Aniff) at 6000 ft.\n\nThis appears to me to be a mountain form of *E. acuminata*, DeC. The leaves are more coriaceous and quite blunt at the tip, and the branches very hairy. The Gunong Kerbau plant has very small leaves, which occasionally show traces of serration.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 61, 1912\nTILIACEAE.\n\n*Elaeocarpus reticulatus*, n. sp.\n\nBranches black.

Inflorescence opposite the leaves with a slender peduncle $1\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long arachnoid, bearing 2 slender branches, one forming a tendril 3-4 inches long, the other bearing a flattened sinuate spike 5 inches long on a secondary peduncle about the same length all slightly arachnoid hairy. Spike undulate sinuate cut to the rachis about 4 times, $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch wide green, or reddish, rachis hairy. Male flowers not seen. Females scattered globose.\n\nSelangor: Sempang Mines climbing over rocks.\n\nA most charming little climber of which I only found a single plant in flower.\n\nLEGUMINOSAE.\n\n*Bauhinia cuprea*, n. sp.\n\nClimber with long curled tendrils branches slender red tomentose. Leaves ovate entire or shortly bifid with short blunt lobes a quarter of the length of the leaf, lamina 3 inches long, $2\\frac{1}{2}-3$ inches wide, above glabrous beneath red ferruginous with closely appressed silky hairs, nerves 7 elevated on the back rising from the base, petiole 1 inch long swollen at the top subglabrous. Flowers pannicled, in a 2 inch panicle, few red, pedicels 2 inches long red pubescent. Calyx tube cylindric narrow half an inch long, lobes pubescent boat-shaped $\\frac{3}{8}$ inch long equal. Petals broadly ovate rounded,\nclawed an inch long \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch wide, densely covered with appressed red hairs. Stamens 3 very short, filaments red hairy at the base, anthers rounded shortly oblong, not longer than the claw of the petal. Style hairy, fruit not seen.\n\nPerak: Gunong Keledang (Ridley 96901).\n\nThis beautiful plant might be *B. Scorteckini* of King of which I have seen no specimen but taking the description, it differs in the flowers being panicled, on long pedicels, the buds ovoid not clove shaped, the longer calyx tube, caducous bracts and clawed petals.\n\n*Bauhinia calycina*, n. sp.\n\nClimber, young parts covered with red meal. Leaves broadly ovate or almost orbicular bilobed, lobes rounded cut about \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) way down, base cordate, glabrous, nerves 10 from the base, 3-5 inches long, 3-5 inches wide, petiole 1\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)-2 inches. Flowers racemose large white, rachis red mealy. Pedicels 1\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inches long. Bracts lanceolate acuminate red pubescent.

Pod oblong cuspidate 7 inches long 2 inches wide, stalked above the enlarged calyx tube, 1\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long. Seeds four elliptic flat.\n\nJohore: Gunong Pulai; Selangor: Kwala Lumpur and Petaiing; Negri Sembilan: Bukit Tanga (Napier), Bukit Kupayiang (Cantley), Seremban (Ridley 10047).\n\nTendrils long curled, \"Akar Kurutop Hitam.\" Roots boiled for dropsy.\n\nA very remarkable plant from the very long calyx lobes, short petals and very short filaments with long thick anthers. Most nearly allied to *B. Griffithiana*, Prain.\n\n*Crudia penduliflora*, n. sp.\n\nTree. Leaves with 4 alternate leaflets, apex not prolonged, leaflets distant elliptic cuspidate rounded at both ends nerves 6 pairs lowest ones smallest glabrous thinly coriaceous drying brown on both sides, 1 to 4 inches long, 1\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch wide, cusp \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long, petiolule short stout, black wrinkled glabrous, \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long. Racemes simple pendulous 12 inches long, flowers small numerous, subdistant nearly sessile, \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long. Buds ovoid. Calyx lobes 4 ovate glabrous. Petals 0. Stamens 5, filaments slender, anthers rounded elliptic. Pistil covered with red hairs conic. Style filiform \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long.\n\nMalacca: foot of Gunong Mering, Mt. Ophir (Ridley 3004).\n\nThis plant differs from any other known to me in its long simple racemes and small flowers. It appears also to have only five stamens. The nerves of the leaves are invisible above, beneath they are seen to interarch well within the margin.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 61, 1912.\nMelastoma mutica, n. sp.\n\nBush, branches terete covered with short flat processes, and larger ones lanceolate triangular acute and laciniate. Leaves unequal lanceolate acuminate acute base hardly narrowed, above covered with fine appressed pubescence, beneath similar with longer hairs on the nerves; nerves 5, depressed above, elevate beneath, transverse nervules parallel numerous, 3-6 inches long $1\\frac{1}{2}-2$ inches wide, petiole half an inch long densely hairy. Flowers few shortly stalked large rose pink. Bracts ovate to lanceolate cuspidate densely hairy with lanceolate acuminate processes, half an inch long and as wide. Calyx tube $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long ovoid densely finely covered with yellowish hairs. Petals cuneate obovate, apex broad rounded truncate, $1\\frac{1}{8}$ inch long, $1\\frac{7}{8}$ inch wide. Stamens similar filaments as long as the anthers, shorter than the petals, anthers cylindric acuminate base bilobed, not prolonged, wrinkled.\n\nSelangor: Hulu Semangkok (Ridley).\n\nAllied to M. sylvaticum, Bl. Remarkable among our species in having the stamens all similar.\n\nOchthocharis sylvestris, n. sp.\n\nSmall shrub, stem woody solid, erect 2 feet tall, about $\\frac{3}{16}$ inch through glabrous, bark pale. Leaves ovate lanceolate or ovate acuminate glabrous except at the base, on both sides, and nerves two pairs rising from the base 7 inches long, 3 inches wide, petiole 1-2 inches long hairy along the upper edge. Flowers in small axillary fascicles much shorter than the petioles, pedicels very short. Ovary glabrous urn-shaped. Sepals triangular mucronate, rather large spreading. Petals oblong broad. Stamens short 8. Anthers oblong obtuse, all similar, hairs hardly prolonged below, apices distinct divaricate excurved, appendage solitary, conic very short, Capsule $\\frac{1}{8}$ inch long globose grooved, crowned with the calyx lobes, dehiscing irregularly.\n\nMalacca: Merlimau (N. Cantley) 9/2/86. Johore: Tanjong Kupang (6504), Mt. Austin (Ridley 12012).\n\nIn wet places in woods.\n\nPhyllagathis cordata, n. sp.\n\nStem hollow hairy. Leaves ovate cordate, abruptly acuminate, margins crenate subdentate, each tooth bearing a long red hair, nerves 9 radiating from the base, transverse nerves prominent beneath above glabrous, beneath with scattered long hairs on the nerves and nervules, 9 inches long 7 inches wide, petiole covered with red hairs stout, 6 inches long.

What I take to be his plant is one of the biggest in the Peninsula, but if I am correct in my identifications the leaves are by no means always glabrous, the nerves being minutely mealy pubescent in many plants. The flowers are commonly pink, but occasionally white. I include under this the following specimens.\n\nSelangor: Kuala Lumpur (Curtis), Batu Caves (8238, 8585), Ginting Peras (7403); Perak: Lenggong (14477), leaves glabrous, flowers pink, fruit large; Pahang: Kota Glanggi (flowers white);\nTronoh (Machado), Tampin (Goodenough); Dindings: Lumut (10278).\n\nAllied to this is *O. costata* described below which is a large plant like full size *O. erubescens* but has a dilated strongly ribbed calyx.\n\nA plant distributed under the name *O. erubescens*, Wall. by King collected at Gopeng by Kunstler No. 5853 of his herbarium and quoted by King as that species in the Materials, has velvety leaves hairy on the edge, and cannot be classed with *O. erubescens*, nor does it resemble any other plant I have seen.\n\n**Ophiorrhiza fruticulosa**, n. sp.\n\nA slender branch shrublet, leaves caducous below, leaving bare stems, branches flexuous, dark, nodes dilated \\( \\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{2} \\) inch apart. Leaves equal lanceolate acuminate base cuneate minutely pubescent with very short scattered hairs above, longer and more abundant on the edge, dark above, when dry pale olivaceous glabrous beneath, \\( 1\\frac{1}{2}-2\\frac{1}{2} \\) inches long \\( 1-1\\frac{1}{2} \\) inches wide, petiole \\( \\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long slender. Stipules very small ovate rounded soon caducous. Peduncle slender pubescent half an inch long. Branches of inflorescence as long in fruit, pubescent. Flowers \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long on pedicels of the same length. Calyx short semiglobose with short ovate lobes. Corolla tube narrow, 3 times as long lobes lanceolate reflexed. Stamens exsert 5 linear cylindric truncate. Style slender exsert. Fruit sub-reniform oblong upper margin nearly straight hardly indented, quite glabrous \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch wide, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch deep.\n\nSelangor on the top of the limestone cliffs at the Batu Caves (Ridley 8287, 8583), fl. July, December.\n\nA very distinct species in its slender branching woody habit, small flowers and exsert stamens.\n\n**Ophiorrhiza costata**, n. sp.\n\nA large herb over a foot tall, stem succulent pubescent. Leaves usually equal ovate acuminate base cuneate, 6-8 inches long, \\( 2\\frac{1}{2}-3\\frac{1}{2} \\) inches wide, glabrous when adult, nerves 9 pairs dark above paler beneath, petiole an inch long. Stipules linear acuminate \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long. Cyme pubescent peduncle 1 inch long. Branches few about 2 inches long. Bracts none. Pedicels as long as the calyx pubescent. Calyx enlarged subglobose strongly ribbed pubescent, lobes short acute. Corolla stout cylindric pubescent \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long, pink, lobes reflexed short and broad. Stamens not extruded except the tips. Fruit \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch across scabrid, transversely oblong reniform, upper margin indented.\n\nPahang: Telom (13644), Gunong Berembun at 6300 feet; Selangor: Bukit Hitam (Kelsall 1908) and near the Semangkok Pass (8584 Ridley).\n\nDistinct in its widely dilated ribbed calyx, I took this at first for a form of *O. erubescens* but it is very distinct, I find. A plant in young flower I got on Gunong Angsi in Negri Sembilan differs\nin its much more hairy leaves and stems. The leaves have also more nerves.\n\n**Ophiorrhiza tenue**, n. sp.\n\nWeak herb 4-8 inches tall not or little branched, stem succulent slender hairy. Leaves equal or unequal, ovate thin base broad slightly cuneate subobtuse or acute, sparingly hairy on the upper surface or glabrous, glabrous except the nerves beneath, 2-4 inches long 1 to 1\u00bd inch wide, nerves 5 pairs or more fine, petiole slender half an inch long pubescent. Stipules reduced to a ridge. Cymes very small \u00bd inch long, few flowered, peduncle puberulous very short. Flowers \u00bc inch long. Bracts absent. Calyx dilated small with short lanceolate teeth, pubescent. Corolla white dilated upwards, lobes nearly as long reflexed, tube with hair in the mouth. Stamens extruded filaments filiform extruded, anthers cylindric truncate. Capsule short linear oblong transversely edge indented \u00bc inch across.\n\nPerak: Telor Pinang (No. 9767) and Tambun; Selangor: Dusun Tua (May 20).\n\nA very odd little species with very few small flowers, of a very different shape from most species, almost urn-shaped. The stamens protruded further than any species I know of.\n\n**Ophiorrhiza communis**, n. sp.\n\nHerbaceous usually not or little branched or in strong plants more branched and occasionally creeping. Stem pubescent or hairy. Leaves ovate or more often lanceolate acuminate at both ends, equal, above dark beneath red or drying yellowish, glabrescent, with sprinkled hairs above, beneath the midrib and nerves mealy pubescent, and occasionally the whole surface beneath puberulous, 4-6 inches long 1-1\u00bd inch wide, petiole 1 inch long. Stipules setaceous. Peduncle 1 inch long or more. Cyme branches slender often eventually spreading over an inch long, flowers conspicuously secund, white, cyme branches and flowers glabrous or somewhat pubescent. Pedicel short as long as the calyx. Calyx ovoid, lobes short blunt. Corolla tubular, lobes short. Stamens not exsert. Fruit transversely oblong \u00bc inch across short, upper margin straight, cells somewhat swollen usually puberulous.\n\nMalacca: Bukit Tampin (Goodenough 1860); Selangor: Rawang (7404), Ginting Bidai 7402, 7407, (var. with pink flowers); Petaling: Sempang (12075), Semangkok Pass (8580), Klang Gates (13413); Sungei Ujong: Bukit Sulu (Cantley); Dindings: Pangkor (8345); Perak: Larut Hills to the top; Telok Pinang (9765); Pahang: Telom (13642), Kwala Lipis (Machado 11577); Kedah: Yan; Borneo: Kuching on Matang.\n\nCommon all over the woods of the Peninsula except Singapore and Johore where it is replaced by the allied *O. singapurensis*, from which it is distinguished readily by the much less hairy leaves. It is more inclined to creep than that species.\nA robust form with large leaves 6 inches long and 2 inches across, occurs on Gunong Mering, Mt. Ophir (3209).\n\nAn elongate lanceolate narrow leaved form is from Gunong Tungul, Dindings (7194), and a small compact form with rather more coriaceous leaves was collected at Kwala Teku near Gunong Tahan by Robinson (No. 5534).\n\nI think it probable that this is what Sir George King refers to as *Ophiorrhiza Mungos* of the Peninsula. It is obviously different from the *O. Mungos* of Ceylon the type of the species.\n\n**Ophiorrhiza singapurensis**, n. sp.\n\nHerb a foot tall, little or not branched, stem succulent hairy glabrescent below. Leaves oblong lanceolate, acuminate obtuse, narrowed at the base hairy on both surfaces especially densely on the nerves beneath, light green above pale beneath, drying back brown above and red beneath, 5-6 inches long 1\u00bd-2 inches wide, petiole hairy 1 inch long. Stipules setaceous hairy. Cyme hairy peduncle half an inch long, branches as long. Flowers white, shortly pedicelled. Calyx short subcylindric slightly dilate, lobes lanceolate. Corolla tube \u00bc inch long, lobes very short oblong all hairy outside. Fruit hairy \u00bc inch across broadly V shaped, upper margin rather deeply indented, about half as long as wide.\n\nSingapore: Bukit Timah (6899), (Hullett 335), 2855, Pulau Damar, Pulau Ubin (Hullett 424), Jurong 10763; Johore: Gunong Pulai (Ridley 12204), Gunong Panti (R. 4172), Sungei Tebrau (13221); Negri Sembilan: Bukit Sulu (Cantley); Dindings: Lumut (Ridley 7195); Lingga Island (Hullett).\n\nThis species appears to be confined almost entirely to the South of the Peninsula, and is abundant in Singapore and Johore, the only species in the island. It does not appear to have been collected by Wallich, nor it is taken up in the Materials. It is the hairiest species of our region except *O. tomentosa*, Jack.\n\n**Ophiorrhiza Kingiana**, n. sp.\n\nStem unbranched rather woody 6 to 15 inches tall, velvety hairy above. Leaves ovate to oblanceolate shortly acute at the tip narrowed at the base 2-inches long, one inch wide, nerves 8 pairs, above scabrid with minute raised dots, beneath very shortly velvety, of the same colour on both sides, margins fringed with hairs, petiole \u00bc inch long seabridly velvety. Peduncles axillary and terminal in flower \u00bc in fruit 1 inch long velvety, branches few short. Flowers small white \u00bc inch long glabrous. Calyx minute campanulate with short points. Corolla tubular lobes short not reflexed, white. Fruit \u00bc inch across, oblong rather deeply emarginate glabrous, somewhat resembling that of *O. erubescens*.\n\nPerak: Dense jungle rock soil near limestone 300 to 500 feet, Gopeng, April 1884 (King's collector 5853).\n\nMost nearly allied to *O. tomentosa* but much less hairy, and with fruit longer and narrower, and glabrous.\nOphiorrhiza nervosa, n. sp.\n\nA stout herb with a hairy stem over a foot tall. Leaves ovate acuminate base broad abruptly cuneate to the petiole above glabrous scabrid hairy beneath, the midrib and nerves brown hairy 4-6 inches long 3 inches wide, nerves 15 pairs, branched at near the tip the branch inarching into the next nerve, petiole brown hairy half an inch long. Stipules setaceous. Peduncle 2 inches long hairy. Cyme branches 1\u00bd inch long. Flowers shortly pedicelled. Calyx cupular ribbed lobes blunt, all hairy as long as the pedicel \u00bc inch. Corolla glabrous \u00bc inch long, lobes short oblong.\n\nSelangor: Semangkok Pass, (Pahang track) (Machado) May 1893.\n\nA single specimen without fruit, appears quite distinct from its closely nerved rather thick leaves and rough scabrid surface beneath. The leaves are rather fleshy and dry black or nearly so.\n\nMussaenda purpurascens, n. sp.\n\nSarmentose with dark colored branches thickly covered with purple hairs. Leaves elliptic acuminate broad based 4 inches long and 2 inches wide, subcoriaceous, above glabrescent except the midrib densely purple hairy, beneath paler, nerves 10 pairs and midrib and secondary nerves densely purple hairy, petiole very short \u00bc inch long hairy. Compound cymes terminal on the branches very many flowered 2 inches across entirely hairy. Bracts linear. Flowers nearly sessile. Calyx cylindric urn-shaped with short acute points, hairy, enlarged lobe oblanceolate, much narrowed to the base on a hairy stalk \u00bc inch long, apex rounded blade white hairy on the nerves, 2\u00bd inches long 1 inch wide. Corolla tube an inch long, slender cylindric, upper quarter urn-shaped \u00bc inch through, lobes short broadly ovate acute all hairy except the inner face of the lobes. Anthers shortly projecting slightly hairy.\n\nSelangor: Sempang Mines track, Semangkok Pass. Perhaps nearest to M. macrophylla, Wall. but with much longer corolla and with rounded bases to the leaves.\n\nUrophyllum coriaceum, n. sp.\n\nShrub, stems white and corky. Leaves in rather distant pairs lanceolate acuminate with a long point, narrowed slightly at the base or rounded coriaceous above smooth and glossy nerves invisible or depressed beneath cinnamon brown when dry, nerves 9-10 pairs elevated, 5 inches long 1\u00be inch wide, petiole black \u00bd-\u00be inch. Stipules caducous. Flowers few in short axillary cymes, with short peduncle and pedicels pubescent. Calyx cupular with a broad base margin truncate with only obscure traces of teeth. Corolla \u00bc inch, rather coriaceous, lobes 5, lanceolate acute, hooded, tube short. Anthers oblong surrounded by a tuft of long hairs. Fruit obovoid, crowned with the limb of the calyx tube.\n\nMalacca: Mt. Ophir (Ridley 10105) at an altitude of about 1000 ft.\nDistinct in its white stems and coriaceous leaves and stiff petals.\n\n**Urophyllum lasiocarpum**, n. sp.\n\nShrub, stem densely appressed hairy. Leaves oblong or elliptic acuminate with a long point, base rounded, above glabrescent except the midrib appressed hairy, beneath densely hairy with brown hairs especially long on the midrib and veins 4-6 inches long 1-1\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) inch wide, petiole \\(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch long densely hairy. Stipules caducous linear acuminate hairy. Cymes sessile about as long as the petiole in fruit. Flowers not seen, fruit very shortly pedicelled \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch long turbinate globose densely hairy. Calyx tube entire truncate covered with long hairs. Seed very numerous small ovoid deeply reticulate dark brown.\n\nPerak: Bujong Malacca (Ridley 9726) Sept. 1898.\n\nThough I have not seen flowers of this species it is so distinct that I do not scruple to describe it. The very hairy leaves, and short petioles, and fruit covered with long hairs distinguish it from any species known to me.\n\n**Canthium velutinum**, n. sp.\n\nA shrub, covered with soft velvety hairs, brown when dry. Leaves lanceolate acuminate sessile with an acute apex and rounded base 4 inches long, \\(1\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch wide densely hairy on both surfaces, nerves invisible above prominent beneath, 5 pairs ascending. Stipules small lanceolate densely hairy. Flowers bright green in axillary tufts, pedicels \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch long hairy. Calyx goblet-shaped, limb very short truncate \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) inch long. Corolla half an inch long tubular with 4 narrow lanceolate lobes, less than half as long valvate densely hairy outside, inside glabrous except for a tuft of hairs on each lobe above the tube, and a circle of hairs within at the base. Stamens connate into a cone round the stigma. Anthers linear acute, filaments short linear attached to the mouth of the tube glabrous. Style longer than the tube, stigma large oblong bifid at the tip, points recurved. Disc elevated. Fruit pyriform ribbed half an inch long densely velvety, pendulous. Pericarp thin woody 2 celled, 1 cell empty the other containing one seed.\n\nPerak: Gunong Keledang (Ridley 9719).\n\nA very distinct species in its large velvety flowers and pear-shaped fruit but most nearly allied to *C. pauciflorum*, King.\n\n**Coffea malayana**, n. sp.\n\nA shrub or small tree 10 to 15 feet tall, branches yellowish when dry, 4 angled. Leaves coriaceous elliptic acuminate, base acuminate 7-8 inches long 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}-3\\) inches wide, nerves 13 pairs meeting on intramarginal loops, drying dark shining above, cinnamon brown beneath, petiole \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch long. Stipule yellowish cartilaginous shining connate into a tube with a lanceolate point \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch long. Flowers in crowded clusters in the axils sessile 14 or more together.\nCalyx short cup-shaped, edge entire. Corolla 1 inch long white, tube slender, lobes narrow linear \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\) inch long. Stamens 5, anthers linear apiculate filaments short, all included in the tube and adnate to it above \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the distance from the mouth. Styles very slender, stigma clubbed. Fruit small globose or elliptic one-seeded, Seed globose bony.\n\nJohore: Gunong Panti (Ridley 4177); Selangor: Bukit Hitam (Ridley 7413), Kwala Lumpur (10217); Negri Sembilan: Gunong Berembun (Cantley) and Bukit Kandang; Malacca: Bukit Tampin (Goodenough 1864).\n\nThis plant is described by Cantley as 10 to 15 feet tall, the wood used in house building, and fencing, of a reddish colour and sinking in water. He gives the names of Chiapet, and Kambang Semangkok Jantan for it and Goodenough found it called Gading Jantan in Tampin. (Gading is a common name for the small tree Rubiaceae such as Diplospora). The tree appears to be a true Coffee and has curiously been overlooked in the Material for a flora of the Malay Peninsula, and one specimen (No. 10217) has been referred to by King to Lasianthus coriaceus which it slightly resembles in leaf, but the venation is quite different, the inarching nerves being very conspicuous. I have seen very few ripe fruit but all I have seen are one seeded, the seed very hard and globose, with the embryo at the base.\n\nThis is a new genus to the Peninsula flora but as the Coffees occur both in India and Java, it is not unexpected. Its crowded flowers, narrow linear petals and one seeded fruit distinguish it from all others of this region.\n\nBecheria n. gen.\n\nA small branched shrub, with thin large leaves elliptic cuspidate. Stipules ovate triangular. Inflorescence terminal compound cymose. Flowers small white. Bracts lanceolate to orbicular. Calyx lobes 4 orbicular enlarging after the fall of the corolla and becoming oblong obtuse. Corolla tube very short glabrous without and within lobes valvate 4, ovate shorter than the tube. Anthers subsessile linear acuminate 4 in the mouth of the tube. Style shorter clubbed entire. Fruit globose crowned with the enlarged sepals woody, 2 celled, 2 ovuled.\n\nSpecies 1, Malay Peninsula.\n\nB. parviflora, n. sp.\n\nA small shrub with pale bark and the habit of Adenosacme. Leaves elliptic cuspidate base shortly cuneate, glabrous, midrib depressed above, elevate beneath, nerves slender 12 or 13 pairs elevate beneath, secondary nerves very slender, 7 to 8 inches long \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) to \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inches wide, petiole \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long. Stipules ovate triangular cuspidate nearly \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long. Peduncle 1-2 inches long with 3 or 4 divaricating branches pubescent, the branches sometimes cymosely branched again. Flowers very small \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long crowded in cymes\n\nJour. Straits Branch\non the ends of the branches. Bracts and bracteoles lanceolate, the former \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long in pairs, the uppermost ones orbicular with ciliate margins. Calyx lobes orbicular margins ciliate. Corolla greenish white rather coriaceous, lobes valvate ovate shorter than the tube. Anthers linear acuminate.\n\nPahang: Kwala Tembeling, Tahan river (Becher\u2019s expedition); Selangor: near the Batu Caves (No. 8258); Perak at Tapah; St. Barbe isle, South of Singapore (Lauglasse). In thick woods.\n\nThe name is associated with Mr. H. M. Becher, an explorer drowned accidentally in the river Tahan in 1893, during an expedition in which this plant was collected.\n\nI cannot find any genus which can include this plant. It has the appearance to some extent of an *Adenosacme*, but the fruit which I have not seen fully ripe separates it. The enlargement of the calyx into distinct wings is curious.\n\n*Ixora micrantha*, n. sp.\n\nLarge shrub. Leaves thinly coriaceous lanceolate acuminate at both ends but more gradually at the base 4 inches long, one inch wide, nerves 9 not very conspicuous, petiole \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long, winged to the base. Stipules abruptly subulate from a broad base \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long, compound cymes terminal 4 inches long, peduncles of cyme \\( 1\\frac{1}{2}-2 \\) inches long red brown, minutely hairy secondary branches about an inch long, pedicels very short, central flowers of cyme nearly sessile. Bracts ovate acuminate \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) inch long, or less. Calyx small campanulate with 4 very short rounded lobes \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) inch long. Corolla tube nearly \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long slender, lobes oblong rounded at the tip, whole limb about \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long.\n\nSelangor: Sempang mines.\n\nThis species seems most nearly allied to some forms of *I. grandiflora*, Wall.\n\n*Timonius Finlaysoniana*, Hook. fil.\n\nThis is reduced to a variety of *T. Jambosella* by King and Gamble, but that can hardly be maintained. The plant is a tidal mud bush with white flowers, and very different from the open country yellow flowered *T. jambosella* in almost every organ. It is undoubtedly as good a species as any in the genus.\n\n*Timonius malaccensis*, King and Gamble.\n\nThe type of this is given as collected by me on Mt. Ophir No. 3217, but the only Timonius collected by me there bears the number 3231.\n\nThis is a shrub, resembling *T. Rumphii*, (which is a tree however) but differs in such characters as one would expect to find in a mountain region. There is also another species in Mt. Ophir, or it may be a further modified form, described further on. Neither exactly fit King and Gamble\u2019s description. Another mountain *Timonius* was collected on Gunong Tahan by Robinson and\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 61, 1912.\nWray. It is of the same type as the Ophir plants, but differs in several important characters. The *Timonius* Rumphii of Penang Hill, differs again remarkably from that of the south of the Peninsula, approaching the Mt. Ophir plant in its stiffer leaves which are nearly glabrous and not silvery yellow on the back as is the case in the Singapore plant, and Hooker in the Flora of British India points this out and suggests that they form a different species.\n\n**Timonius oreophilus**, n. sp.\n\nA shrub, bark dark coloured. Leaves broadly lanceolate acuminate at both ends coriaceous, nerves seven pairs, above glabrous, beneath lighter coloured with midrib and nerves covered with appressed hairs, 3 to 6 inches long, 1\u00bd to 2 inches wide, petiole thickened at the base \u00bd inch long back hairy. Stipules lanceolate triangular acuminate hairy, when fallen leaving a circle of hairs. Cymes shorter than the leaf. Male flowers on short cymes, peduncle \u00bd inch long rather thick covered with appressed hairs, branches 2 shorter similar. Bracts lanceolate acuminate. Flower \u00bc inch long shortly pedicelled. Calyx cupular with 4 short subacute teeth covered with appressed hairs. Corolla \u00bc inch long hairy, lobes short blunt. Anthers linear, base prolonged deeply bifid glabrous. Style cylindric hairy. Females in pairs on long \u00bd inch slender peduncles. Bracts broader, ovate acuminate hairy. Drupe cylindric oblong \u00bc inch long hairy crowned with the persistent calyx lobes.\n\nPahang: Kluang Terbang (Barnes 10886); Mt. Ophir (Hullett 837); Selangor: Bukit Hitam (Ridley 7397, 7399); Kedah Peak (a form with very narrow leaves).\n\n**Saprosma saxicola**, n. sp.\n\nA small bush, glabrous with pale bark.

Stipules of numerous pale subulate processes, \u00bc inch long. Cymes very short in flower of about 5 flowers. Bracts of several subulate teeth. Peduncles and pedicels very short, lengthening in fruit to a quarter of an inch\nrespectively. Pedicel and calyx tube scurfy pubescent, lobes short ovate 5.

Common.\n\nSingapore: Tanglin, Tanjong Katong; Johore: Tana Merah Road (Ridley 2741); Pulau Dayong (Kelsall); Muar: Bukit Kayara, Sungei Pauh (Fox); Pahang: Sungei Meiang; Penang: Tanjong Bunga (Curtis 3400); Tringanu: Bundi (Rostado).\n\nOne of the plants recommended as a cure for opium craving. A piece said to be from Shanghai was sent me as thus used.\nThe plant is undoubtedly closely allied to the Ceylon plant which is recorded as a montane plant, only differing in its being much more glabrous. This plant was in the flora of the British India referred to *G. Pseudo-china*, Dec. a plant with leaves all sub-radical. The Malayan Peninsula plant has the stem leafy, and its general appearance is that of a *Sonchus*. In the Materials it appears to be described in combination with the next species under the name *Gynura bicolor* a Moluccan plant with much larger spreading heads and apparently absent from the Peninsula. The roots are not tuberous as is said to be the case in *G. pseudo-china*, but fibrous, nor can I fit it to any of the species described from India, Malay islands or China. It only occurs in waste ground in open spaces, cleared by cultivation, and is presumably not a true native of the Peninsula but an introduced weed.\n\n**Gynura rosea**, n. sp.\n\nA herb two to three feet tall. Stem solid ribbed when dry. Leaves petiolate not auricled 12 inches long or much less, deeply lobed to the midrib or nearly so, lobes dentate decurrent on the midrib very variable in size and dentation, quite glabrous green or often more or less purple. Capitula numerous on branches often 3 inches long, or in a single cluster, whole capitulum \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long, occasionally when in fruit, cylindric. Involucre cylindric hardly swollen at the base green. Lower bracts linear acute. Involucral bracts narrow linear olive green cuspidate minutely hairy, keeled with a scarios edge. Calyx pappus hairs very fine silky bright pink. Corolla pale rose nearly white, lobes tinted pink. Achene brown ribbed glabrous narrowed to the tip, pappus white.\n\nSingapore: Gardens, Pulau Ubin, Chan Chu Kang; Pahang: Telom; Selangor: Kwala Lumpur (Curtis 2349); Perak: Ipoh (Curtis 2995); Penang: Government Hill (Curtis 2995); Dindings: Lumut (Ridley); Java: Sindang Laya (Hullett).\n\nA common weed in waste ground, I can find no name for this plant. King confuses it with the last species under the name of *Gynura bicolor*, DeC. from which species it is entirely different. It is easily recognized by its deeply cut leaves and rose pink flowers.\n\n**ERICACEAE.**\n\n**Rhododendron spathulatum**, n. sp.\n\nA shrublet with slender branches dark brown and densely minutely pustular.

The capsule (which has not been described is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) inch long narrow at the base dilated at the upper end and shortly beaked. It contains 4 seeds in the upper end, flat papillose and somewhat obovate.

I have this curious plant in cultivation in the Botanic Gardens in Singapore.\n\nBaillon described a species of Synadenium as Euphorbia Synadenia but this has been referred to its genus Synadenium, so that the above name will stand.\n\nCupuliferae.\n\nQuercus Rassa, Miq.\n\nOn the top of the mountain Gunong Semangkok grow two oaks, which are certainly not typical Q. Rassa but at the same time there are in the Singapore herbarium specimens which seem to be intermediate forms. The typical Q. Rassa is a tall tree with very narrow close veined coriaceous leaves, and this is the plant which grows on Penang hill, where it does not vary to any extent. King in the Calcutta Annals mentions a variety latifolia which I take it is represented by his 6983 from Gunong Hijau in Perak.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nOn Gunong Semangkok at 4375 feet altitude we have a plant much resembling this. Its leaves and branches are glabrous and the leaves stiffly coriaceous ovate or oblong ovate acute 3 inches long $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inch wide, with only 6 pairs of nerves, which are distant from each other, the minute tessellate reticulations so conspicuous in typical *Rassa*, are much less conspicuous. The petiole is a quarter of an inch long. The inflorescence terminal is stout, its bark on the rachis black and minutely pubescent. The spikes 3 inches long and stiff. The male flower bunches are rather distinct.\n\nThe acorns are sessile, with a shallow cup half an inch across, $\\frac{1}{8}$ inch deep, with about ten rings; these have the upper edge waved with distinct teeth. The glans is a short broad cone half an inch long beaked light brown and minutely silky (No. 12061 of my collection). The plant growing on the top of the Trig. station which of course has been cleared and is now covered only with low bushes is itself a low bush only a few feet tall. A specimen obtained by Barnes from Kluang Terbang (10910) resembles this somewhat but the leaves are mostly more intermediate between that and those of typical *Rassa*, some however are ovate with fewer nerves, and somewhat similar is Kunstler's No. 6983, from Gunong Hijau in the Taiping hills, which he describes as a tree 40 to 46 feet tall. This is the plant I take to be King's var. *latifolia*.\n\nWith this grows on Gunong Semangkok, a shrubby oak with lanceolate long acuminate leaves, which when young are coppery red. They are about four inches long and one inch wide. The petiole a quarter of an inch long. The young leaves are sprinkled all over with stellate hairs and these are densely crowded on the midrib and petiole. The adult leaves are nearly glabrous, the reticulations are the same in appearance on the upper surface as in the Penang *Rassa*, but are inconspicuous on the smooth lower surface. The branches are covered with a woolly mass of these stellate hairs as are the slender weak spikes. This I would call the var. *lanuginosa*.\n\nBoth of these two forms or varieties grow closely intermixed in scrubby bushes up to the waist or shorter on the top of the hill, but I saw the var. *lanuginosa* further down the hill about 20 feet tall.\n\nHad I not seen these plants intermixed with intermediate foliage, I should certainly have distinguished them specifically, both from each other and from *O. Rassa*, but I would rather class that species as a very variable oak varying according to altitude and exposure, of the mountain on which it grows.\n\n**Orchideae.**\n\n*Microstylis flavo-viridis*, n. sp.\n\nStem weak ascending leaves scattered: whole plant 11 inches long.

RIDLEY, C.M.G., F.R.S.\n\nThe group of islands of which Pulau Adang is the largest lies to the west of the islands of Lankawi and Terutau. It consists of 3 fairly large island Pulau Adang, Pulau Rawi and Pulau Butong and a number of smaller islets.\n\nThe flora of this outlying group had never been investigated and I was glad of the opportunity afforded me by Mr. Robinson to accompany him there in the \"Seabelle,\" in April. Leaving Kuala Lumpur on April 18th, at 5 p.m., we arrived at Penang next morning and starting again in the afternoon reached the islands on April 20th., about daybreak. The party consisted of Mr. H. C. Robinson, Mr. Seemund, Dr. Hanitsch and myself, with a number of zoological collectors and my botanical collector. We brought a motor-boat and with the aid of this and the ship's gig landed the collecting party on Pulau Rawi. The only signs of human occupation were a few coconut palms and bushes of *Justicia Gandarusa* on the shore. Mr. Robinson and I started through the woods to climb the hill. On the seashore I saw a number of plants of *Geodorum purpureum* but none in flower. The forest proved very poor as a collecting ground, consisting of a number of big trees rather scattered, and an abundance of climbing lianes, chief of which were *Agelaea vestita*, some *Menispermaceae*, a climbing bamboo like one seen at Alor Star, *Calami* and *Korthalsias*. The undergrowth was scanty, a red *Ixora (I stricta)* and other shrubs, *Corymbis veratrifolia*, and *Aspidium polymorphum*. The most striking tree was the tall *Randia exaltata* 30 feet or more high and 9 inches through. It was in flower and we felled one to secure specimens. The flowers are white spotted within the tube with black. It occurs also in Penang, Burmah and the Andamans. Returning to the shore we found the littoral vegetation consisting of *Vitex pubescens*, *Terminalia Calappa*, *Barringtonia speciosa* (very big trees with the branches curiously ringed), *Desmodium umbellatum*, *Stemona Curtisi*, etc. The Barringtonias bore great quantity of *Drynaria* and a pale pink flowered *Hoya (H. parasitica)* grew over the boughs.\n\nSome of the Dyaks returning from collecting brought *Acanthus ilicifolius*, *Eulophia Keithii* and *Saccotabium miserum* with its little inconspicuous yellow and white flowers.\n\nIn the afternoon we went in the motor-boat to a bay in the eastern part of the same island. Here the steep rocks were covered with scented species of *Andropogon* which however was flowerless and only bore in place of flowers small branches of reduced leaves. Plants brought to Singapore and grown there have done the same.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 61, 1912.\nA pretty slender bamboo of a new species abounded here, and flowering specimens were obtained later. *Dillenia aurea*, Sm., was in flower but as usual at that time nearly leafless. In the evening we went ashore at Pulau Butong and found *Prismatomeris albidiflora* in full flower, a beautiful little shrub *Memecylon* with charming little blue flowers and a *Bombax*, quite a small tree, in fruit. *Cordia subcordata* is abundant on the seashore here.\n\n21st April.\u2014We went to the bay we were in at Pulau Rawi yesterday and followed the stream up nearly to its source, pushing through the low swampy woods or wading along the stream bed. There is a patch of mangrove in the river mouth. *Oncosperma filamentosa* and a large species of *Pinanga* forming big clumps (*P. adangensis*) are abundant in the low swampy woods.\n\nThe river sandy, at the mouth becomes rocky higher up with large masses of hornblende, granite and sandstone. The flora of these rocks is rather poor considering the altitude we got to. A dwarf *Ophiorrhiza*, *Begonia sinuata*, *Podochilus tucescens* are the most noticeable plants.\n\nThe \"Seabelle\" moved from her anchorage in Rawi bay and picked us up at 2 o'clock and we moved on to Pulau Adang where we went on shore in a beautiful bay with a large sized stream entering it. A very big *Dracaena* about fifty feet tall and much branched with erect branches occurred here and was in fruit. It appeared to be a very large state of *Dracaena aurantiaca*, Wall., but I never before saw one so large. A single tree of *Casuarina equisetfolia* grew in this bay, and we found seedlings in Rawi bay. The tree was very abundant at the east end of the island forming a regular wood, and also on the opposite island of Pulau Nipis. These trees have a habit of growing so regularly spaced that they often quite look as if they had been planted. The sand beneath is almost bare of vegetation. From the distance of the Rawi seedlings from any adult tree and their position I am inclined to think that this plant owes its dispersal more to the sea currents than to the wind in spite of its winged seeds.\n\n22nd April.\u2014Mat and I with a boatman pushed up the stream which is rocky, here and there high walls of rock, and on a big rock near the top found a Begonia new to me with flowers, and *Arisaema Kunstleri*, and *Vitis discolor* and eventually reached the top of the ridge. Here were many plants of a species of *Daemonorops* none of which showed any signs of having ever flowered, but seemed to propagate themselves by layering their branches, giving us an opportunity of getting reversed rattan walking sticks. These when made up are very puzzling to those who do not know how they are produced, as the leaf sheaths point to the roots instead of away from them. The branches layer and produce a more or less clubbed end and by cutting the stem between one rooting portion and the next one can obtain a rattan in which the leaves appear to have grown towards the root instead of away from it. The top of the ridge was dry and barren, about 1,000 feet altitude\nabove the sea. *Curculigo latifolia*, a few Pandans and a *Hornstedia* without flowers were the chief plants. A hermit who eats only once a year or on occasions once in three months is believed to reside here. A furious storm of rain with thunder and lightning came on when we were half way down, and we took refuge beneath a rock. On reaching the stream again, we found *Gnetum macrostachyum* in fruit and on pulling it down brought down a spray of a laurineous three new to me, *Dipterocarpaceae* and *Annonaceae*, some of the former of large size are abundant in the woods.\n\nIn the evening we went to Pulau Nipis the point of which is a sandy beach with a wood of *Casuarinas*. Here we found a curious creeping form of *Wedelia biflora* with unusually small heads. *Tournefortia argentea* (new to our flora though a common plant on the shores of many of the Malay islands), *Hernandia peltata* and *Ochrosia* in fruit. None of these at all common in our region. Besides these were *Ipomea-pes-caprae*, *Sceevola Koeningii*, *Cassytha filiformis*, *Ischoecum muticum*, *Hibiscus tiliaceus*, *Calophyllum inophyllum* and *Terminalia Calappa*. Behind this seashore-sand was a wood in which were a number of *Ixoras* and *Weberas*, and here we found *Pogonia flabelliformis* in leaf and flower, *Eulophea graminea*, a clump of what appeared to be *Calanthe vestita* in a decayed bough on the ground and *Dendrobium secundum*.\n\nNext morning I went to the point of Pulau Adang where the *Casuarina* grove was to look for a sedge which Mr. Robinson had told me of and found it to be *Remirea maritima*. The ground beneath the *Casuarinas* was quite bare and the trees bore no epiphytes. The pretty lizard *Liotepis Bellii* was abundant here. Near this point *Colubrina asiatica* was common and *Capparis micracantha*, in the form of a bush, in fruit.\n\nReturning to the \"Seabelle\" we steamed for Pulau Tengah, and on the way was two killer-whales *Orca gladiator*, a new mammal to peninsular waters. We reached Pulau Tengah by midday. It consists of two islands separated by a strong running shallow sea current, too deep however to wade. On landing the plant collector and I attempted to scale the main hill of the island, the top of which was clad by a forest of bananas. The forest was dense and consisted mainly of the prickly *Phylloclamys Wallichii* and strong woody climbers with big trees interspersed. We obtained specimens of the banana which proved to be *Musa Malaccensis*. We returned to the base of the hill and walked along the coast to the north to some very high vertical cliffs. The shore was covered with boulders of laterite, slate and indurated clay. The cliffs seemed to consist entirely of this brown clay hardened into rock; at their base were screes of disintegrated clay, steep and slippery. At the base of the hill we found *Peristrophe tinctoria*, a plant I have never seen elsewhere except as a garden escape, but there were no signs of this place ever having been under cultivation. On the screes we found a new species of *Amorphophallus*, with a creamy\nwhite spadix and a green spathe. *Pleopeltis phymatodes* was very abundant. We did not find this common fern at all in the rest of the Pulau Adang group of islands. It was intensely hot and we returned to the southern shore, finding abundance of fruits of *Gyrocarpus Jacquinii*, a tree not common further south.\n\nAfter collecting a little along the shore and bathing we returned to the boat and left for Kwala Malacca in the Lankawi islands, arriving off Burau bay in the evening where we anchored for the night. Next day we landed and walked up to the 7 Wells, Telayah Tujoh; a good track leads to this spot. On the way I collected a good many plants of interest, *Elettariopsis pubescens*, *Pteris cretica* the grey-leaved variety, a pretty new species of *Phyllanthus* of the *Reidia* section Ph., and found *Mesua ferrea* in flower.\n\nThe seven wells are formed by a stream which descending from the hill behind spreads over a wide space of smooth grey rock. In this are excavated by the water a number of basins, some of which are deep enough to bathe in, and these are the seven wells. The stream then falls over a precipitous slope. The spot is a favourite one for Malay picnics, and the water is supposed to have valuable properties and the men drank some and took bottles home with them, which made them all ill as the water is obviously not fit to drink. The view from this stream is very fine. The rugged range of Gunong Chinchang rises on one side, and on the other are hills clad in dense forest, forming an amphitheatre at the end of which is the deep blue sea. The stream at this point is about 1,000 feet above sea level.\n\nWe returned from here to Penang and then to Kuala Lumpur and so home.\n\nThe most noticeable part about the flora as a whole was its difference from that of the Lankawi islands especially in the preponderance of Malayan as opposed to southern Siamese plants. Naturally the two groups of islands being so near, there were a number of plants characteristic of the south Siamese flora as laid down in a previous paper, but there were also a number of Malay Peninsula forms, such as *Agelaea*, *Urophyllum*, *Lasianthus*, some of the *Dipterocarpaceae* and *Anonaceae*, etc. The flora suggests rather an affinity with the Pulau Song-Song group of islands off the Kedah coast which contains nothing or little of the south Siamese flora. It seems too to have relations with the Andaman islands which are not at all connected with the south Siamese plants but which have a Malayan flora. On the seashores of the Adang group we have a series of plants which are absent almost entirely from the Malay Peninsula, *Ochrosia barbonica*, *Tournefortia argentea*, *Hernandia peltata*, and *Gyrocarpus*. The *Ochrosia* is only known as native in the Peninsula from a specimen said to be collected in Singapore by Wallich. It has never been seen here again. *Tournefortia argentea* has not been seen in our region at all, but occurs in St. Barbe isle south of Singapore and along the Malay isles to the Pacific. *Hernandia peltata* is at least rare on\nour coasts. Cordia subcordata too is scarce occurring in Pulau Song-Song, the Dindings and from Bintang island to the Pacific. All these seem absent or nearly so from the west coast of the Peninsula, although there are at least some suitable spots for them to grow, and quite absent from the east coast where the locality is more suitable, yet all occur in the Indian region and still more abundantly all over the Malay Archipelago to the Pacific.\n\n**Dilleniaceae.**\n\n*Tetracera assa*, De C.\nPulau Rawi.\n\n*Dillenia aurea*, Sm.\nPulau Rawi.\n\n**Anonaceae.**\n\n*Unona dasymaschala*, Bl.\nWoods, Pulau Tengah.\n\n*Goniothalamus macrophyllus*, Hook. fil.\nPulau Adang.\n\n*Oxymitra glauca*, Hook. fil.\nPulau Adang.\n\n*Polyalthia parviflora*, n. sp.\nSmall tree, bark black, young parts covered with brown hair.

J. Wilkinson.\n\nAlone among Malayan townships Malacca may claim to be regarded as ancient and sedate. Singapore is no older than the lifetime of a man, and Ipoh has won its notoriety within the memory of a boy; while Malacca is historic. Her centuries are few, but they are full of achievement, and there is very little local glory in which she does not share. By the Portuguese conquerors she was named la famosa, \"the Renowned:\" she is linked with the memory of Camoens, Albuquerque and St Francis Xavier, and stands for whatever is medieval and romantic in a country that is lacking sadly in veneration and romance.\n\nBut there have been many Malaccas; and the oldest of all\u2014that of six centuries ago\u2014was a petty village of Sea-Sakai or Orang Laut, a fishing-hamlet of no fame and no importance. A humble beginning, perhaps, for so great a name; yet there are times when it is well to be obscure and when meekness may inherit the earth. The third quarter of the fourteenth century was one of these occasions. The greatest local power of that day, the Javanese empire of Majapahit, decided suddenly to play a leading part in history and to take a high place among the conquering nations of the world. It sent out its fleets, swept down on the thousand-year-old Malay kingdom of Palembang, and overthrew it utterly. It destroyed Palembang's daughter\u2014the town of Singapore\u2014with a massacre so cruel that for centuries afterwards the memory of that colony's awful fate was enough to deter any Malay from settling on the island. It broke the rising power of Pasai, the first seedling of a Muhamadanism which was destined at a later date to overthrow Majapahit itself. It harried Langkasuka (Ligor), and left that ancient Indo-Chinese kingdom\u2014older even than Palembang itself\u2014to fall an easy prey to the advancing armies of Siam. The wars of 1370 to 1380 A.D. effaced all that was then ancient and historic in Malaya. But, as for Malacca, what was there in a street of shanties and a fleet of dug-outs to attract the conquering arms of Majapahit?\n\nSo Malacca was spared to become a refuge and a shelter for the homeless people of the stricken towns, men of Hinduized Singapore and Palembang, Moslems from Pasai and Buddhists from the North. The little aboriginal fishing-village of 1370 A.D. had become a cosmopolitan trading-port in 1403 when it figures for the\n\n*Reprinted from the 'Singapore Diocesan Magazine', August 1911, pp. 7-11, by kind permission of the Author, and of the Editor, the Rev. Frank G. Swindell.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 61, 1912.\nfirst time in the records of contemporary nations. The town in those early days was a walled or stockaded cluster of huts upon St. Paul's Hill; and right in the heart of the place there was built a wooden godown or store in which goods were warehoused for safe keeping pending the arrival of a trading coaster or junk. The currency was tin; the trade was in tin, resin, and jungle-produce. The local Chief, a Hindu by faith, styled himself paramisura or king, but a few years later he became a Muhammedan and took the name of \"Sultan Muhammad Shah, the Shadow of God upon Earth.\" He was a keen man of business and made at least one voyage to China in pursuit of his own ends.\n\nAlmost all the present Sultans of Malaya\u2014outside Selangor\u2014claim descent from the Paramisura who reigned over the godown on the slopes of St. Paul's Hill. To this day, when the casual visitor walks from the landing-steps to the Stadthouse he can see on the slopes of the hill a weird image that an expert will tell him is a Makara, a monster of Hindu mythology, the sole surviving relic of the time when the Ruler of Malacca was still a Hindu. Among the regalia of one of the Peninsular Sultans he may also look upon a silver seal, a reputed relic of the Paramisura's later years since it bears the name of the \"illustrious Sultan Muhammad Shah, God's Shadow upon earth.\" But the courtly genealogists of our Malayan princely houses do not stop at Muhammad Shah; they trace his pedigree through a long line of earlier kings, rulers of Singapore and of Palembang, to Chaosroes the Great, King of Parthia; to Alexander of Macedon, King of Rome; to Darius and Artaxerxes, Kings of Persia; to Jamshid and Kai Kaius and Kai Kubad, Kings of Romance; as far as Kaiomerz, \"son of Adam and elder brother of Seth,\" for it is to Seth that the meaner branches of humanity owe their origin. But The Paramisura himself knew nothing of this; he was not a genealogist; he had an eye for realities. He went submissively to China with his tribute of tin and jungle-produce, accepting in return raiment embroidered with dragons or unicorns, girdles of precious stones, gold and silk and paper money. One quaint old piece of embroidery in the ownership of a modern Peninsular Sultan seems to date back to the time when the Ruler of China honoured the Paramisura with dragons of gold and gems.\n\nThe line of trader-princes did not die with Muhammad Shah. His son, Iskandar Shah, paid two visits to China, one in 1414 and the other in A.D. 1419. Iskandar Shah died in A.D. 1424 and was succeeded by \"Sri Maharaja,\" otherwise Ahmad Shah, another merchant-king. In the days of its poverty, Malacca had been a village of mean huts served by humble dug-outs, but the visits of the great Chinese junks made it grow into a trysting-place for the traders of the Eastern seas. Whole colonies of strangers flocked to the port from Java, from Burma and even from distant Madras. Suburbs sprang into existence. Bandar Hilir began as a Javanese settlement; so did Kampong Upeh (Tranquerah); the Tamils and the Burmese had also quarters of their own. St Paul's Hill was\nmerely the citadel, the heart of Malacca, the abode of the Sultan and of his Malay nobles, the ruling centre of the town. But the days when the Sultan attended personally to business were over: a new generation of Malay princes had sprung up, eager for fame and wealth yet averse to labour: greedy of glory but not of the risks of war. The toll levied on the trade of the port enabled the Sultan to send out armed bands of hooligans who forced the little hamlets on the coast to bow to the dominion of Malacca. This was the second Malacca the imperial city of Mudzafar Shah and Mansur Shah (1445-1470 A.D.) the old Malayan Empire at the very height of its greatness when it ruled over Pahang, Kampar, Siak and Indragiri.\n\nWhat was it like, this chief among Malayan cities of the year 1460 A.D.? The old primitive semi-aboriginal village of the Paramisura had been swept away; it had known no houses except dug-outs, and no luxuries except matting, in the making of which the women excelled. The new Malacca lacked its modern hinterland of rice-fields and orchards; it was still a thin line of houses stretching along the sea and river front. But the line was longer than before and the character of the houses had changed with the character of the town. The place swarmed with adventurers from all parts of the East. In its stories we read of Afghan swashbucklers; Indian jockeys and mahouts; Kling warriors who\u2014after the manner of their kind\u2014advanced when the enemy retreated and retreated when the enemy advanced; and men of religion from Arabia, sometimes genuinely pious, sometimes merely hypocritical, but always thoroughly unpopular. Indeed such a cosmopolitan seaport town was no place for the practice of the meeker virtues. We read of a government, stern, severe and corrupt; of municipal surveyors who induced the Sultan to decree that a street must be straight in order that they might be bribed to certify to the straightness of the crooked; of judges who took presents from one side on the clear understanding that they were not to be blamed if they took presents also from the other; of the election of a prime minister by the simple process of setting all the candidates in a row and letting the Sultan say \"choose Uncle Mutahir.\" In such a city of the strong no weak citizen was really free; every man sought a patron, the mightier the better, for it was better to pay toll to one chief than to many. Thus it came about that the greater nobles lived in walled enclosures amid the huts of their own followers and slaves. There at least they were safe from the irresponsible bravoes who levied blackmail for themselves by asserting falsely that they came in the dreaded name of the King. At night every enclosure was bolted and barred against the intrusion of thieves, trespassers and illicit lovers; and even policing was unpopular since it exposed the patrolling minister of police to the risk of finding his sovereign in places where the Sultan did not want to be met. For in this\n\nR.A.Soc., No. 61, 1912.\ncity where every other law was broken daily there was one rule that was kept inviolate: no man, whatever his wrongs, dared lift his hand against the King.\n\nIt was a strange feeling, this loyalty of the ancient Malays. A man might murder a hero or saint, or betray a relative or friend, or abduct an innocent girl; if he did it in the interests of a royal intrigue it was a noble act of self-sacrifice according to the ethical code of the day. And strangest of all was the spirit in which tyranny was met. The chief of the King's Ministers, the \"Uncle Mutahir\" to whom allusion has been made, had so much love for a favourite daughter that he kept the report of her beauty from reaching the ears of the Sultan lest she should become the victim of his caprices. The girl married her cousin. The Sultan came later to a knowledge of the truth. He slew the girl's husband and carried her off to his palace; he slew the girl's father and all her family; he sent men also to carry off the wealth of the house. Yet when the dying \"Uncle Mutahir\" saw his own indignant son destroying property rather than let it reward the iniquity of the tyrant, he stayed him: \"Is the Sultan to be impoverished and my death to profit him nothing?\" Even a protest against royal ingratitude had to be driven home by self-sacrifice. A Malay noble who had grown grey in his ruler's service and had risen to be War Minister and Commander-in-Chief once saw an enemy's fleet approaching and felt that resistance was vain. He said little. He drew up a list of the few gifts that he had received from his master in the course of his long years of work\u2014a plate or two of chipped china and a pot or two of worn brass\u2014and sent the list, emphasizing its poverty and meagreness, with a farewell letter of thanks to the donor. The King was profuse in his penitence. But the old man would take no further reward; he named the spot at which he was destined to die and went down to meet death for a cause that he saw was lost and a master whom he knew to be worthless. Conduct of this sort was ideal loyalty, as the Malays of the time understood it.\n\nSuch loyalty degrades a royal caste. The self-made early princes of Malacca, the Paramisura and his son, were men of business and intelligence. The conqueror-kings, Mudzafar Shah and Mansur Shah, were men of ambition. But the later Kings of Malacca, born when the wealth had been acquired and the ambition realized, were gloomy, capricious and jaded tyrants who found more interest in destroying than in building up. Sultan Mahmud Shah, the last of the Malacca rulers, was a roi fain\u00e9ant. He plundered, and violated; but he was wise enough to leave all the real work of administration to his Ministers. Foremost among them was the Bendahara who was destined to so tragic an end; next came the Bendahara's son Tun Hasan, Minister of War, and the Laksamana Hang Nadim who commanded the fleet. Even at this distance of time when\nwe read the cold commentaries of the Portuguese and the gossiping tolerant anecdotes of the Malay Annals we can feel that these three ministers were men of unusual character: the eldest, the Bendahara, calm, self-contained, temperate and cautious; the two younger men, passionate perhaps and hot-headed, but gifted with an energy and a persistence that is rare among men born under the sun of the equator. And Malacca needed them; for it was just when these three men were at the height of their authority that the town was startled by an unexpected and most ominous apparition\u2014the first European fleet that ever sailed into its harbour. That was in August, 1509; the Admiral was the Portuguese, Diego Lopez de Sequeira.\n\n*The Capture of Malacca, A.D. 1511.*\n\nBY\n\nThe Hon\u2019ble R. J. Wilkinson.\n\nIn an age accustomed to the comfort of modern sea-travel it is not easy for a writer to convey more than a faint academic idea of the hard lot of the first-comers to the Eastern Seas: the leaky ships, the stifling cabins, the stale unpalatable food, the putrid water, the dirt, the overcrowding, the scurvy, the danger of storms, the discomfort of the steamy tropical calms, and the anxiety of approach to an uncharted and hostile coast. Yet if we are to take the measure of men like d\u2019Almeida and d\u2019Albuquerque we must try at least to realize the task that was set before them. Columbus and da Gama had been simple navigators who staked their lives upon their skill and upon the truth of their geographical beliefs. The first \u201cViceroys\u201d were men of another type, men who dreamed dreams and saw visions of empire in the seemingly hopeless plan of pitting the small frail ships of Portugal against the untamed vastness of the Indian Ocean and against the teeming millions who inhabited its shores. D\u2019Almeida was the apostle of Sea-Power. He saw that with all their apparent weakness his ships had at their mercy the commerce of whole continents; and he preached the doctrine of a supreme navy. Alfonso d\u2019Albuquerque disagreed. He was a veteran and distinguished soldier, a man of authority, who believed in Sea-Power but not in its all-sufficiency. He mocked at the theory of an Eastern empire that owned no ports or docks and could not caulk a ship except by the favour of an ally. He was the apostle of the Naval Base, sea-power resting on the shore. Moreover, as a man of ancient lineage, cousin to Spanish kings, himself a knight of the Order of Christ, he would not take service under Francis d\u2019Almeida.\n\n*Reprinted from the \u2018Singapore Diocesan Magazine\u2019, November 1911, pp. 8\u201413, by kind permission of the Author, and of the Editor, the Rev. Frank G. Swindell.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 61, 1912.*\nKing Emmanuel put an end to the quarrel by naming both the disputants Viceroys and by giving each of them a fleet and a separate sphere of authority. This was in 1508. To another adventurous spirit, Diego Lopez de Sequeira, the King gave an independent command, a squadron that was to operate outside the waters of India and Africa and to bring new oceans under the sea-power of Portugal. These last were the ships that cast anchor at Malacca on that fateful 1st August, 1509.\n\nAs soon as the fleet was anchored a boat put off from the shore to ask in the name of the Bendahara who Sequeira was and why he came. Sequeira had brought an Arabic letter from King Emmanuel to the Sultan of Malacca; he asked permission to deliver it along with the gifts that went with such epistles. He was forced to wait. His arrival was an event of the first magnitude to Malacca; was it wise to begin relations of which no man could predict the end? So thought the Bendahara. The Sultan saw no harm in reading a letter and receiving gifts that committed him to nothing; he overruled his minister. A Portuguese named Teixeira was sent ashore and was conducted on an elephant to the palace, where he had the desired audience of the King. It is not difficult to picture the scene: the crowds outside who mobbed Teixeira in their inquisitiveness; and the silent staring faces that lined each side of the long palace-gangway up which an envoy was expected to make his way, with many halts and ceremonious bows at every few feet of the passage and every step of the dais. Teixeira was a stranger to Malay etiquette. He presented his letter with a sailor's jovial cordiality, and in a burst of further friendliness he fastened a necklace of beads round the neck of the Bendahara, just as though that minister was an African Chief who would glory in such tinsel. An angry murmur followed the Portuguese as he fumbled with the sacred person for the first noble in the country. \"Let him alone: heed him not; he is only a mannerless boor\", said the Bendahara. Teixeira's bold and blustering assurance was intensifying the nervousness, the fear of the Unknown, that chilled every heart in Malacca.\n\nThe days passed. No man dared attack the strangers; yet no man ventured to befriend them or trade with them, for who could foresee the end? The Indian merchants were anti-Portuguese to a man; they knew what trade-rivalry meant. The Bendahara saw that the strangers would be far less tolerant of oppression than the Indians whom they wished to supplant; in the interest of trade he preached a holy war against the infidel. The warriors of the city were discreet. They were to get the hard blows of the war, and the Bendahara the pickings of the trade; they elected to arm and wait. No one in fact wanted to fight. Sequeira had come for customers. He waited, hoping that the Malays would appreciate his pacific policy, but he could gain nothing by delay: it was the one thing that the Malays desired. Sequeira grew impatient, then petulant, then menacing; the monsoon was slipping by and he\ncould wait no more. Even at this stage, war was not what he wanted, nor did it suit the Malays. A situation of extreme delicacy is always fraught with dire peril; and in this case the accidental (or semi-accidental) firing of an alarm-gun on a Portuguese ship led to hostilities over some petty mistake. The fighting was half-hearted but it spread. The Malays on board the Portuguese ship jumped into the sea; such European sailors as happened to be on shore were seized and captured. Teixeira saw the error when too late. He was too weak to attack the sullen angry city that had now broken off all relations with him; the monsoon was dying away; his ships were sadly in need of repair; and in the end he had to sail home having tarnished the fame of his country and left his luckless comrades at the mercy of their foes.\n\nAccording to Malay ideas the Bendahara was the leader of the resistance to Sequeira. He had done no fighting; indeed he had done nothing at all; but a statesman who achieves stupendous results by the simple process of inaction is a man who deserves better of his country than the hero of a hundred costly fights. So thought the people; so, doubtless, thought the Bendahara himself. The Sultan thought otherwise. He saw that \"Uncle Mutahir\" was becoming far too great a personage; and he recalled many old grievances against his minister. There was the avuncular wealth to be garnered; and there was that little matter of the Bendahara's daughter which had never been explained to His Highness's proper satisfaction. His Highness sent two of his followers to summon the Bendahara \"to God's presence\" as they politely put it. The Bendahara bowed his head and died. The men of his household died with him; his daughter was carried off to the harem of the Sultan; and his riches were dissipated in festivities at the wedding of the Sultan's daughter to the son of the Ruler of Pahang. Suddenly in the very midst of all this wassail the King's joy was turned into bewilderment by the unexpected reappearance of the Portuguese fleet\u2014this time in overpowering strength under the Viceroy d'Albuquerque himself.\n\nAs soon as King Emmanuel had heard of the disaster to Sequeira he had sent (March, 1510) three ships under Diego Mendez de Vasconcellos to avenge the defeat. These ships sailed first to India to consult with d'Albuquerque. The great Viceroy was too expert a commander to weaken his forces by dispersing them into detachments; he detained Vasconcellos depending the complete subjugation of Goa and the organization of the naval base in India. Then when all was ready in the early Summer of 1511, d'Albuquerque sailed out to attack Malacca with every ship and soldier that he could muster. On the 1st July, 1511, he appeared in the roads with the entire force of Portuguese India,\u2014nineteen ships, 800 European soldiers and 600 native sepoys,\u2014with trumpets sounding banners waving, guns firing, and every demonstration that might be expected to create a panic among the junks in the harbour and the warriors in the town.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 61, 1912.\nThe effect was immediate. The ships in the harbour\u2014Chinese junks and Gujerati trading-vessels\u2014tried to sail away, but were intercepted and brought back to their moorings with every show of friendship. They then offered to join the Viceroy in the attack on the town, but this offer was declined with thanks; the Portuguese admiral could afford to bide his time. Meanwhile the Malays and the Sultan were too dumbfounded to act; no boat put out from the shore, no message was sent. By the following morning, however, the Sultan, regaining some of his old assurance, sent a boat to greet d\u2019Albuquerque and to say that the wicked Bendahara who had instigated the attack on Sequeira had been punished with death for all that he had done. D\u2019Albuquerque replied, expressing his gratification, but pointing out that the Portuguese prisoners had not been released, and that pending their release the town must be regarded as accessory to the attack on Sequeira. The Sultan was now in a dilemma. He realized that he could not keep the prisoners without removing his mask of friendliness, nor could he release them without giving up his hostages for the security of the town. He tried the Bendahara\u2019s policy; he temporized. But d\u2019Albuquerque was no Sequeira. He knew that any general attack would be the signal for the death of his fellow-countrymen; still, risk must always be taken. He entered into secret into secret communication with Ruy d\u2019Aranjo who was the leader among the captives and his own personal friend. Ruy d\u2019Aranjo spoke of divided counsels in the city, and advised attack. The Viceroy continued to feel his way. He seized some of the shipping and sent a few shots into the town. Then he waited. The hint was taken; Ruy d\u2019Aranjo was released.\n\nThe Viceroy was now in a stronger position. He went on to ask for a heavy indemnity and for permission to open a permanent trading-station at Malacca. The Sultan demurred; he might have allowed the factory but he was quite unable to spare any money for the purpose of buying off the Portuguese. Meanwhile the war-party in the town was coming slowly to the front. It was headed by the Sultan\u2019s son Alaedin, by the Prince of Pahang, and by the young bloods of the place who knew nothing of war and were eager for the fame that it brings. The Sultan himself preferred peace and quiet. He thought he could secure what he wanted by letting the Portuguese and the war-party oblige each other with the necessary quantum of fighting; as for himself he was a peaceful person who cared for none of these things. He told the Viceroy that he was poor and anxious for friendship, but quite unable to meet the demands that were being made upon him.\n\nD\u2019Albuquerque began now to prepare for war. He knew his own mind and had a definite policy: that of substituting a Portuguese for a Malay government and leaving the foreign traders undisturbed. He gave the Javanese and Indian leaders assurances to that effect and received their promise of neutrality in return. In the matter of local knowledge he was well served by the fact that Ruy d\u2019Aranjo\nand the other prisoners had spent two years in the town and had come to know the locality, the language, and the foreign merchants. Still the task before him was a hard one. In those days the channel of the Malacca River turned sharply to the right after reaching the sea and allowed ships to lie at anchor off the mudbanks on which the houses are now built. Disembarkation on those mudbanks was impossible; the key of the position was the landing-place at the mouth of the river and at the foot of St. Paul's Hill, but unfortunately for the Portuguese this point lay beyond the reach of the covering-fire of their ships' guns while it was exposed to the fire of every Malay stockade and building in the vicinity. The Viceroy tried to grapple with the difficulty by building a sort of armed raft or floating-battery which could float in shallow water and be moored at the mouth of the river so as to silence the Malay gun-fire and cover the landing of the troops. The battery was a failure. It grounded in the wrong place was exposed to a very heavy fire, and was only saved from capture by the heroism of its commander, Antonio d'Abreu who stuck to his post though wounded grievously. At last d'Albuquerque was compelled to attack without the help of any artillery to cover his advance; he sent out a strong force, cleared the landing-place of the enemy's troops by a sudden rush, and then forced up the floating-battery to a more commanding position where it made short work of the Malay defences. This advantage was not secured without heavy loss; for after the first surprise of the first Portuguese attack the Malays had rushed together from all quarters and had made a most desperate onslaught upon the landing party which they endeavoured to throw back into the sea. The prince Alaedin, mounted on an elephant, headed this charge in person; and the Portuguese lost 60 men before it was repulsed. This success and the destruction of the Malay defences encouraged the Portuguese to follow up their advantage by an attack upon the mosques and palaces on St. Paul's Hill, but the Malays were numerous and were fighting under cover while the Viceroy's troops were bewildered by the confused mass of building and were driven back with heavy loss. So ended the day. The Portuguese had cleared the landing-place; and that was all.\n\nThe crowning attack took place on St. James' Day, the 24th July, 1511. The Viceroy landed troops again under cover of the guns of his floating-battery but when once they had come ashore they were charged by a wild mob of 700 Malays and mercenaries under the Prince Alaedin in person. The fight was long and furious; and though it put the Portuguese to heavy loss it could only end in one way: armour, superior weapons, discipline,\u2014everything was on their side. The Malays retreated once more to the shelter of the buildings that had served them so well on the previous day. This time d'Albuquerque advanced with more caution; he burnt the buildings as he went along. The work was slow and cruel, for the defenders shot down poisoned arrows upon\nthe attacking Portuguese, who were burdened with the weight of their armour, and exhausted by the heat of the sun and by the fire and smoke from the burning houses. Again and again, with diminishing forces, did the Prince Alaedin lead out his men in sudden rushes and win momentary success, only to be repulsed in the end. So too, now and again from the upper reaches of the river, did the Laksamana Hang Nadim send down his war-canoes or fireships to take the enemy in the rear or harass his communications\u2014all to no avail. Night separated the combatants; and the Portuguese retreated to their ships, saddened by their heavy losses and by their consciousness that the work of destruction was only half accomplished.\n\nOn the following day the Viceroy disembarked his men once more and proceeded with every precaution to assail the smoking ruins that had covered the resistance of the last two days. He found no one to oppose him. Prince Alaedin and his Laksamana had retreated up the river and were awaiting attack at Pagoh on a battlefield of their own choosing. The Prince of Pahang had gone back to his own country as the fighting had lost all attraction for him. The Sultan had seen the burning of the palace and was not sure that his policy of lazy neutrality would justify him in meeting the Viceroy face to face; he removed himself with all possible despatch beyond the reach of any Portuguese marauding party. The aged bedridden Bendahara who had succeeded the murdered Mutahir was borne off in a litter by his loving relatives while he invoked curses on the cowardice of a generation that was not as the warriors of his youth. The Malay power was broken. The Javanese, Burmese and Indian merchants were for peace at any price and hastened to make their submission to the Viceroy, and, as an earnest of their goodwill, helped him to dislodge the Prince Alaedin from his chosen lair at Pagoh. The prince fled far away; a few scattered bands of outlaws represented all that was left of the famous Malay empire of Malacca.\nThe Old Cemetery on Fort Canning, Singapore.\n\nWith a plan and four plates.\n\nBy H. A. Stallwood.\n\nThis register of tombs in the Old Cemetery on Fort Canning was compiled by order of Government on the suggestion of Mr. C. B. Buckley who, in his \"Anecdotal History of Singapore\" mentions the loss of the register and suggests that a new one should be compiled.\n\nNo trace of the old register\u2014for it must be assumed some such record existed\u2014can be found, and it has therefore been considered desirable to make as complete a record as possible of the names of those old residents and visitors whose remains have found a resting place in this sacred spot.\n\nThe Cemetery stands on the slope of Fort Canning Hill, and is approached from the South by Fort Canning Road, through a gateway designed partly in the Gothic style of Architecture. It was opened in 1822 to take the place of the first Christian Cemetery which was situated close to where the flag-staff at Fort Canning now stands. It was closed when the Cemetery in Bukit Timah Road was opened in 1865.\n\nThe Southern half of the ground was allocated to Members of the Anglican community, and the Northern half to those of other Christian denominations, the dividing line being marked by a wall.\n\nThe grounds are kept in order by the Public Works Department, and, apart from any interest in the place as a graveyard, the beautiful shaded walk offers an attraction to those who appreciate quiet, contemplative surroundings.\n\nTo those who feel an interest in Singapore and its history, few places in the Settlement offer so much of interest. Many old residents lie buried here, and many tombstones testify to the number of lives sacrificed by members of the Civil Service, who were called to rest at a very early age, whilst taking their share in the administration of this Settlement, of which we are all so proud. The United Services also yield their quota of names, unfortunately, some well-known, if not illustrious, in the annals of their country.\n\nThe oldest tomb discovered is that dated 1821, erected to the memory of John C. Collingwood of the ship \"Susan\" A 30. It is surmised that this stone was taken from the old original Cemetery and re-erected here, as this Cemetery was not opened until 1822. The latest discovered is dated 1868, erected to the memory of Marie Dominica Scott, (B 229) a child of only two years of age, and the interment presumably took place after the Cemetery was closed in 1865, as the parents were possibly interred here.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 61, 1912\nNear the Southern gateway in the East side stands a monument erected by Captain the Hon: Arthur A. Cochran C. B. and Officers of H.M.S. \"Niger,\" to the memory of their Comrades who fell in action, died of disease, or were drowned in the exercise of their duties:\n\nOther graves of interest are those of:\n\nA 13. Hon: F. L. C. Edward Presgrave, Civil Service, and the Rev. Robert Burn, late Chaplain of this Settlement. Both lie buried in the same vault.\n\nA 26. Captain William Scott, who was Harbour Master here, and one of the most respected residents of his time. He was a cousin of Sir Walter Scott. Scott's Road is named after him, where he owned some property.\n\nA 55. Stephen Hallpike, one of the earliest Settlers in Singapore.\n\nA 63. Commander William Maitland, of H.M.S. \"Spiteful\" who died on board in the Roads at Singapore. A tablet to his memory is on the wall of the Cathedral.\n\nA 134 The Hon: Charles Robert Lindsay, second son of the late Earl of Balcarres.\n\nA 191. James Henry Leopold Grey, son of the late Hon: Edward Grey, late Bishop of Hereford.\n\nA 216. Thomas Moncrieff, fifth son of the late James Wellwood Moncrieff, one of the Judges of the Supreme Court of Scotland.\n\nB 6. Sir Jos\u00e9 D'Almeida Carvalho E'Silva, Portuguese Consul-General in the Straits Settlements, one of the most prominent of the old Singapore pioneers. He was knighted by the Queen of Portugal in 1842 on his appointment as Consul-General. His portrait is in Raffles Library.\n\nB 14. George Doungold Coleman, Superintendent of Public Works. He was responsible for laying out many of the main roads, and designed the first St. Andrew's Church. Coleman Street and Coleman Bridge are named after him.\n\nA 163. Captain Leslie, also Superintendent of Public Works in this Settlement.\n\nC 80. John Colin Campbell, second son of the late Sir Guy Campbell, Bart; who died on board H. M. S. \"Bittern.\"\n\nA 264. Monument erected by the Captain, Officers and Ships' Company of H. M. S. \"Spartan.\"\n\nThe tombs are mostly constructed of brickwork, plastered, and can boast of no architectural beauty. Many have fallen into disrepair; others are fast decaying and tumbling down. In many cases the inscriptions are illegible, though cut in granite, as they have been left unattended, and have had to give way to time and weather. The inscriptions cut in marble have stood well and can be very easily deciphered.\n\nEvery care was taken in compiling the register, which was a work of some difficulty, and, though errors may have crept in, it will be found, on the whole, to be fairly complete.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nFor the translation of the inscriptions on the tombs of Chinese residents who lie buried here, I am indebted to the Hon'ble C. J. Saunders, Secretary for Chinese Affairs, who has kindly supplied me with the following notes:\n\n\"The inscriptions on the Chinese tombs were carefully deciphered as far as possible by Mr. Yung Sz Meng, my clerk and interpreter, who copied the inscriptions in Chinese. He has also helped me in transliteration and translation. In cases in which the grave does not give the birthplace or place of origin of the deceased, it has been assumed that he was a Tiechiu.\"\n\n\"The Christian names gave some difficulty and I am indebted to Mr. Go Lai Quee, of the Supreme Court, for interpreting many of them. In graves B. 24, 25, 67 and 101, I have had to content myself with giving the Chinese sounds.\"\n\n\"The gravestones, as is customary with the Chinese, often mention the names of those who erected the stone: it has thus been possible to give the information as to the relatives of the deceased which is found in column 3.\"\n\n\"The names of prefectures and districts in China are given in Romanised characters: the names of smaller localities are given in Chinese characters. Where it is possible and necessary, the tribe ('bangsa') of the deceased is given in brackets.\"\n\n\"No English-Chinese calendar is available for the years before 1834, and for years up to 1833 the month and the day are therefore given according to Chinese reckoning. Where the year of an event is alone given, or where the event happened in the 11th moon and no day is given, it is impossible to say in which of two years according to Western reckoning the event happened. The Chinese year is often given not by the year of the Emperor's reign, but merely by the characters of the 60 years cycle, and in a few cases (e.g. B. 34) in the absence of evidence as to the deceased's age at death, it would be impossible to say whether he died e.g. in 1798 or 1858, if we did not know that at the former date the Cemetery was not open. In a few cases the graves give dates according to the Western calendar.\"\n\n\"Most of the graves in Section B., two of the graves in Section D. and one grave in Section C. had at the top four Chinese characters meaning 'May Eternal Light shine on him (or her)' with a cross or a cross in a circle in the middle of the inscription.\"\n\nThe accompanying plan shows all tombs and graves, but those without inscriptions, or with illegible ones, have been omitted from the following list. This accounts for the gaps in the consecutive numbering.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 61, 1912.\nIt is hoped that on the publication and distribution of this register descendants and relatives of those buried in the Cemetery will come forward and assist in the repair of the ruined tombs and thus prevent the total decay and destruction of the monuments which form so interesting a link with the past.\n## Section A.\n\n(The number refers to the number on plan).\n\n| No. | Name                  | Description                                      | Born       | Died       | Age          |\n|-----|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|--------------|\n| 1   | Napier, James Brooke  | Infant son of William Napier Esq.

STURROCK.\n\nThe variations and differences of dialect are of course found in\n1. Vocabulary.\n2. Pronunciation.\n3. Distinct usages of word and phrase.\n\n1. Vocabulary.\n\nIn this respect the dialects of Perak and Pahang are little different: the Kelantan dialect differs widely from both. Taking in the first place the personal pronouns.\n\n(a) \"I\" is in Perak sahaya\n    teman\n    aku.\n    in Pahang sahaya\n    kawan (colloquially).\n    in Kelantan sahaya\n    hamba (most common colloquially).\n\nThus the word \"sahaya\" is found in all three dialects, but its use in Kelantan is very uncommon indeed, so uncommon that it is probably an imported word. It is useful as a polite and less humiliating variant to \"hamba\" when an inferior is addressed. The word \"teman\" is unknown in Kelantan: and \"kawan,\" though found, is clearly an importation from Pahang.\n\nIn the written language \"beta\" is used in Perak, \"sahaya\" and \"kita\" in Pahang, and \"kita\" in Kelantan. Of course this is not a rule without exception: for as the customs and language of the more advanced West become known in Kota Bharu, etc., the variants of the other states are found gradually to creep into both the written and spoken dialect. Perak is acknowledged to be the leader of fashion and to be worthy of imitation in most respects.\n\n(b) \"You\" is Perak in mika\n    kamu.\n    in Pahang awak.\n    in Kelantan kita (polite).\n    diri\n    mu (much as kamu is Perak).\n    kamu (which is coarse).\n\nThis use of kita may be common to the Northern States, but it has not come to my notice except in Kelantan. \"Diri\" is also quite commonly used: and \"mu,\" rather coarse, is purely colloquial, and\nwould always be used in conversation with inferiors and young people.\n\n(c) He, She etc. The Malay expressions are the same in all three dialects; but in Perak and Kelantan \"dia-ma\" colloquially pronounced \"deema,\" is the ordinary plural. In Pahang I never once heard this expression. In Perak only have I noticed similar forms in the first and second persons, as \"sahaya-ma\" and \"kamu-ma.\"\n\nIn comparing the dialects of Perak and Pahang as regards differences of vocabulary, these, I think, are comparatively few. In Pahang we find the word \"molek\" in common use, where both \"elok\" and \"chantek\" are used in Perak: \"s\u0113lalu\" is found where in Perak \"langsong\" is employed: and the use of \"rajin\" is common where in Perak \"s\u0113lalu\" is the expression found, e.g., \"ta' rajin\" means \"never.\" The most common expression in Pahang for \"every\" is \"sa-bilang,\" e.g., \"sa-bilang hari\" which means \"every day.\" \"Often\" in Pahang is \"kerap,\" usually \"kerap kali:\" in Perak we find \"galak\" or \"galak kali\" employed: while in Kelantan again we find the expression to be \"achap\" or \"achap kali.\" In Pahang, instead of the expression \"punya\" signifying possession, the Arabic \"hak,\" literally meaning \"possession\" or \"property\" is used: and it frequently takes the place of \"yang\" (relative pronoun) as well. Only in Pahang have I heard the word \"chamchah\" used for \"spoon:\" and in Pahang and Kelantan the word \"serampang\" for \"fork.\" The word \"lalu\" in Pahang has an adverbial use as well as its ordinary signification, viz., meaning \"absolutely,\" e.g., \"ta' guna lalu,\" meaning \"absolutely no good:\" \"habis lalu,\" \"absolutely finished\" \"Amat is generally used in Pahang where in Perak \"terlampau,\" \"sangat,\" or \"sakali\" would be used. To intensify \"amat,\" \"sangat\" is added.\n\nThe Kelantan dialect differs widely from both Perak and Pahang dialects. It is the least pure of all the Malay dialects I know, and intermingled with Siamese and even Chinese expressions, though the latter are comparatively few. There are many other alleged Malay words, which as far as my experience goes, belong to Kelantan alone, though it is possible that they are used in other Northern Malay States. I have mentioned the personal pronouns, and in this connection I must not forget to state that the word \"awak\" for \"you\" is accepted as being quite polite, but no Kelantan Malay cares to be addressed as \"kamu.\" It may be for this reason that Court charges always employ the expression \"kamu!\" \"Hamba\" is practically the one colloquial word for \"I\" as is kita in written form.\n\nI give a list of Kelantan words with meanings as types of the difference in dialect.\n\n| English or Malay | Kelantan Malay |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| To see           | Kleh, bergari. |\n| To hasten        | hunggal        |\n| List             | s\u0113narai        |\n| To take census; make a list | s\u0113naraikan |\n\nJour.

The examples which I know to be Siamese are j\u00e9naih, utun, kweng, guam, and also such words as \"wat,\" a Siamese temple; \"sam\" a Siamese Court-house; \"s\u00e9mayan,\" a clerk: and I suspect also that s\u00e9narai, gong, gok, and others are of Siamese origin. The Chinese negative \"bo\" is in quite common use.\n\nII. Pronunciation. I should be inclined to put the dialect of Pahang, Central Pahang at least, first as regards normality of pronunciation.\n\nthe final\u2014ar pronounced as \u2014or, as in b\u00e9zar b\u00e9zar  \npron. as b\u00e9zor b\u00e9zor.  \n,, ,, \u2014ul ,, ,, \u2014u\u00ef, as in b\u00e9zul, pron. b\u00e9zu\u00ef.  \n,, ,, \u2014us ,, ,, \u2014o\u00eb, as in bagus pron. bago\u00eb.  \n,, ,, \u2014ir ,, ,, \u2014ior, as in hilir, pron. elior.\n\nthe final\u2014a pronounced as \u2014\u00eb, as in mana pron. as man\u00eb, or as the French \u2014eu.  \n,, ,, \u2014al ,, ,, \u2014ai, as gatal, pron. gatai.\n\nThe Pahang dialect is spoken almost as written, though a few a few eccentricities may be noted. Final\u2014l is slurred over but is not absolutely mispronounced as in Perak. Thus the word \"gatal\" is pronounced almost as \"gata:\" but the impression is left of some-\nthing more than \"gata,\" as if the tongue were trying to overcome the difficulties of the final\u2014l, and just failed to do so. The finals ai and au are also slurred, and are pronounced almost as\u2014a. They approach therefore towards the pronunciation of the final which explains why we sometimes hear of a sungal or a k\u0113dai when a sungai or a k\u0113dai is meant.\n\nKelantan pronunciation is eccentric in a different direction from both the Perak and the Pahang dialects.\n\n1. Suppression of\u2014n before another consonant: e.g., K\u0113lantan is pronounced K\u0113latan; jantan is pronounced jatan. Similarly bangku is pronounced baku, and b\u0113ngkak, b\u0113kak. Here again the impression is left of almost futile striving to pronounce the word in full. On the other hand\u2014n and\u2014ng are frequently inserted in writing where their use is incorrect and superfluous, e.g., b\u0113ngkas for b\u0113kas; this error is only found in writing, and is possibly due to the knowledge of the opposite fault and to a desire to avoid it at all costs.\n\n2. Suppression of\u2014m\u2014in a similar way, again with the counter-error in writing, e.g., t\u0113poh for t\u0113mpoh: tapar for tampar: t\u0113pek for t\u0113mpek.\n\n3. Final\u2014an pronounced as\u2014en, e.g., K\u0113laten for K\u0113lantan; tuen for tuan. The\u2014n is very nasal. Similarly\u2014ang is pronounced\u2014eng, e.g., Paheng for Pahang.\n\n4. Final -a pronounced as -aw, as in the English word \"law,\" e.g., manaw, apaw, for mana, apa. Similarly, -ah is pronounced as -awh, e.g., timawh, lelawh: and -ak as -awk, e.g., Perawk, awawk, kakawk.\n\n5. Final -t, -k, and -p are practically indeterminate. In the case of a word such as \"achap\" it is impossible to tell from the spoken word whether it is really \"achap,\" \"achat,\" or \"achak.\" The word is generally written \"achap,\" and so I assume that form to be correct. Again I am unable to determine whether the word meaning \"to return\" is \"kelik\" or \"kelit.\" I presume the former to be correct, on the analogy of \"balek,\" but as spoken it appears to my ears more to resemble the second form given. This confusion does not always exist, however: it only presents itself in, comparatively speaking, a few cases, but the fact that it exists at all seems to be worth nothing.\n\n6. Final -ng is frequently softened into -m, I find a good example of this error in the Malay programme of Sports held in Kota Bharu on the occasion of the Coronation of the present King. The sentence occurs, \"Jika tiada pakaian seperti yang tersebut itu, memadai-lah dengan baju hitam leher tutup, dan seluar hitam kain sarom sutera atau bugis atau Trengganu chorak hitam diatas lutut\" \"I have frequently heard blakam used for blakang and even tuam for tuan. In this case again we find mistakes occurring in the opposite direction: for one regularly finds the word \"belum\" pronounced and even spelt as \"b\u0113long.\" The latter error is readily explained by the nasal pronunciation prevalent in Kelantan: the former is no doubt the result of revolt against the\ncontrary error. An interesting example of the difficulty caused by the peculiarities of the spoken dialects of the Northern States is that mentioned by Mr. E. W. Birch in one of his articles to the journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Straits Branch. In this article he mentions a discussion between himself, Mr. Hubert Berkeley, and the Dato Sri Adika Raja on the meaning of the name Klian Intan. The discussion was as to whether the name was originally Intan or Hitam. It is a matter which can never be decided, as in Kelantan at least there would be no difference in the pronunciation of the two words. The first -n of Intan would not be pronounced, and the first syllable would be undistinguishable from the first syllable of Hitam; while the nasal pronunciation of the finals -am and -an would be exactly similar.\n\n7. Final -h is frequently pronounced as -s, e.g., putes for puteh galas for galah, tujos for tujoh. I have noticed this in Perak; but there the tendency is rather to slur the final -s and make it approximate the sound of the final -h.\n\nThe Kelantan dialect has some curious clipped terminal affixes, tagged on at the end of words, phrases, and even sentences. e.g., -dik or -dek often at the end of an exclamation or interrogation. No one appears to be able to explain it.\n\n-gak is perhaps the most frequently used of all. It seems to be an intensive, but to possess little real signification or none at all. I have heard when playing sepak raga the phrase used, \"Buleh Haji gak,\" intended to call the attention of the Haji in question to the fact that the raga had come to his foot. Again I have heard the phrase \"Mari gak\" used as a polite invitation.\n\n-teh is another intensive. When used with an adjective, as \"murah teh,\" \"molek teh,\" it acquires something of the meaning of \"b\u00e9nar.\"\n\nAnother and even more curious expression is \"keneh.\" I do not know what it means; so I shall merely give the example of its use quoted to me. It is as follows:\n\n\"Balah tu keneh?\" and is interpreted to mean \"Bagitu-kah?\" It is not only used in interrogation, however, as it would also be used in expressing agreement with the opinion of another person. So that the same phrase \"Balab tu keneh,\" without the interrogation would simply mean \"You are quite right.\" One informant told me that it was chiefly used in anger, but that is not so, and I only mention this fact to show how difficult it is to get a credible explanation of many of these obscure terms.\n\nA combination which I have found only in Kelantan is formed of the term \"sa-rupa\" followed by the expression \"lek-lek,\" the word denoting the object of the simile intervening. \"Lek-lek\" seems to add nothing to the meaning of \"sa-rupa,\" but simply to be an addition repeating without intensifying the signification. It may, however, have the meaning of \"exactly\" e.g., \"sa-rupa harimau lek-lek,\" which perhaps means \"just like a tiger:\" but so far as I know, it does not modify in any way the preceding phrase.\nA phrase \"lolor-lolor\" which means \"at once\" may be akin \"loh\" as found in \"loh ini,\" the Kelantan expression for \"now.\" The interjectory \"loh-lah\" means \"come on;\" and I believe that these phrases are all derived from a common root.\n\nOther phrases worthy of note are\n\nsiat gak, which means jangan-lah (not with a verb)\ntiada sa-k\u00ebteh habok tiada lalu\ni.e. there is none at all.\n\nBalar-lah no matter; tidak apa\nsut dah it is finished\n\nThese notes do not profess to be exhaustive, or to deal fully with any aspect whatever of the Kelantan dialects: nor do I make any claim to have discovered anything that was unknown previously. I have avoided words and phrases which are not in common use, and such as, being technical might not be known to any European in Kelantan. The compilation of the latter is secondary both in point of time and of importance. I have spelt many of the words phonetically as they sounded to my ear: and in many cases, as I have pointed out, the spelling is doubtful. My object, however will be attained if the publication of these notes induces others to set down and publish the result of their observations. In this way alone can a solution be found for many of the difficulties in form and spelling which now exist.\nGunong Tahan and Gunong Riam\n\nBy J. B. SCRIVENOR.\n\nWith plates I\u2014IV.\n\nSo little has been written about the mountains of the Malay Peninsula that there is small reason to give any excuse for the following pages concerning the two highest eminences in the country, Gunong Tahan on the borders of Pahang and Kelantan, and Gunong Riam, better known as Gunong Kerbau, on the borders of Pahang and Perak. The paper is the outcome of a recent ascent of Gunong Riam, and the opportunity of comparing it with Gunong Tahan, which I ascended in 1906, and other peaks that I have visited in the Malay States.\n\nThe height of these two mountains was in 1906 believed to be:\u2014Gunong Riam 7160 feet; Gunong Tahan 7050 feet, but the latest determination for Gunong Tahan makes it 7186 feet and therefore higher than Gunong Riam. For this figure I am indebted to the Surveyor-General, Col. Jackson.\n\nI may as well say at once that no claim to \"mountaineering\" adventures is put forward in this paper. After having ascended four of the highest peaks in the country I know that the journey up any one of them is best described as a rather stiff up-hill walk with an occasional scramble among the thick vegetation. I have not yet seen one place that cannot be easily negotiated. The Saddleback on Snowdon and the Striding Edge on Helvellyn are more thrilling than anything I have seen on the Peninsular Mountains. I expect the limestone hills, however, as being capable of affording any amount of climbing exercise, but they can hardly be called mountains, and generally speaking, little is gained by climbing them. I shall never forget my feelings when once invited to go up a vertical cliff of limestone clinging to one slender creeper. Recollecting that the nearest hospital was five days journey away, I declined.\n\nIt has been my practice when travelling in the Peninsula to attend strictly to my own work and to avoid giving way to the temptation of dabbling in scientific subjects other than my own. This is because I have no reason to suppose that a geologist's zoological or botanical observations are one whit more valuable than a zoologist's or botanist's geological observations. Therefore, beyond an occasional remark, the accuracy of which is not guaranteed, concerning the fauna and flora, I have little to say of a scientific nature; but I believe that a plain narrative of the journeys will prove to be of some interest. The determination of heights of peaks also has been left to those best qualified to give an opinion on the subject, and I have therefore refrained from burdening myself with a heavy theodolite.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nGunong Tahan.\n\nGunong Tahan has been, and perhaps still is to a certain extent, wrapped in the mantle of romance. This is not peculiar to Gunong Tahan alone, however, of the features of northern Pahang, for there was once a strong belief in the existence of a mountain chain between Pahang and Kelantan that trended east and west, of which Gunong Tahan was a part; and as the belief in this range crumbled away, so did the supposed height of Gunong Tahan, originally, if I remember rightly, stated as about 20,000 feet, descend rapidly down the scale, until now it is known that it is only a little over 7,000 feet.\n\nNevertheless, Gunong Tahan has always been an attraction for travellers, probably because of the Malay stories of the difficulties caused by Jins to prevent anyone reaching the top, and in 1905 certainly, perhaps earlier, the summit was reached. I say perhaps earlier than 1905, because in 1902 Mr. John Waterstradt claimed to have ascended the mountain (vide this Journal No. 37, 1902, pp. 3\u201427), and I, for one, am not prepared to say that his claim is unfounded; but unfortunately the record of his journey is hard to follow. Several men have attempted to ascend Gunong Tahan\u2014one, H. M. Becher, lost his life in the Tahan River, while another suffered severe privations and was forced to turn back, narrowly escaping disaster. But the size of Gunong Tahan compared with the great mountains of the world, and the facilities given by the vegetation, are such that its ascent can hardly be accounted a feat of mountain-eering. The unavoidable difficulties met with are those of transport of baggage, and it is the writer's opinion that the only display of pluck was shown by the leader of the 1905 expedition, who, although about to retire, and in none too good health, determined to attempt the ascent before leaving the country, an attempt that was defeated by serious illness on the journey from the Tahan River to the ridge of Gunong Tahan itself.\n\nIf we consider Mr. Waterstradt's claim as a separate question, the honour of first ascending Gunong Tahan belongs to certain Malays with the 1905 expedition, Che Nik, Mu'min, Mat Aris, and Bulang (for an account of this expedition see Journal F.M.S. Museums, Vol. iii., 1908). I met these men in the following year and one of them, Bulang, guided me to the top.\n\nIn 1906, thanks to the timing of the attempt, the lightness of the baggage, the willingness of the Malays with me, and the well-worn paths, the ladders and the huts of the 1905 expedition and a still more recent party headed by Mr. J. C. Sugars, the ascent of Gunong Tahan was made without any serious difficulty being encountered or any hitch occurring with the men. The ascent was, in fact, a picnic.\n\nStarting from Kuala Lipis, I soon reached Kuala Tembeling, where I interviewed the genial Penghulu, Penglima Kakap Hussein, and obtained through him the services of three Tem-\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 62, 1912.\nbeing Malays for the journey. After ascending the Tembeling River for two days the Kuala of the Tahan River was reached and the compact little expedition disposed itself in a dug-out to face the laborious business of ascending the Tahan River. The three Malays were ample to manage the boat and to carry up the mountain sufficient food to sustain the whole party for some days. The baggage consisted of a few cooking utensils, a quantity of plain food, a thin jungle mattress, blanket and mosquito-net, and various spare garments, all wrapped up in three light waterproof sheets, making three convenient bundles. The men's rice, on which I claimed the right to draw, was included with the other food. The three bundles of baggage were placed on a small bamboo deck in the dug-out, and I made myself as comfortable as possible among them. The absence of any firearms was the cause of some expostulation from Kakap Hussein and the men, who assured me that there were many enemies to be encountered, including dragons.\n\nThe three Malays with me were Bulang, the guide, Mat Jeher, and Mat Riflin. Bulang was a short cheerful little fellow who always looked on the bright side of things. Mat Jeher was of a different mould, not particularly pleasant to look upon, he was intensely ignorant and therefore superstitious. He had not been up the mountain before and was obviously very perturbed in his mind about the fate that would overtake him. The third man, Mat Riflin, was, and still is, the pleasantest Malay that I have ever met. He was then about 24 years of age and had received sufficient education to discuss the works of Abdullah and the literature described as \"Malay Readers.\"\n\nThe expedition, with a leader who knew enough to recognise the wisdom of being led, began the journey up the Tahan River on the 11th of May. The Tahan River is not the most navigable river in the world, and although in Europe it would not attract notice on that account, because no one would attempt to navigate it, being of much the same nature as a rocky trout stream in mountainous country, here, in the Malay Peninsula, what might be held out in the United Kingdom as a lure to trippers, become objectionable features that must be surmounted if one would proceed. There is one long still reach; the rest is all rapids, nothing really bad in the way of rapids, nothing to compare with the rapids in the Tembeling above Kuala Tahan for instance, but still enough to necessitate frequent unloading of baggage and hauling the boat over rocks. What the distance to Kuala Teku, where one leaves the boat, may be, I do not know, but it took our lightly equipped party three days to arrive there. The dryness of the season may have made our progress slower than it might have been otherwise.\n\nApart from the beauty of the Tahan River, flowing over its rocky bed through an avenue of magnificent jungle trees, two things associated with it have left a strong impression on my memory. One was Jeher's nightmares. On our way upstream we slept in little sheds built by gutta-hunters. They were most conveniently\nplaced, and as there were no mosquitos, the inability to hang up a net inside them did not matter. But we were closely packed, and when Jeher suddenly leapt up the first night, yelling \"we're sinking, Allah help us, we're lost entirely\" or words to that effect, we all woke up in alarm. But only that once. Jeher had nightmares every night afterwards, being chased by dragons, crushed by irate Jins, or falling over precipices, but he got no sympathy. The first yell was the signal for an onslaught by the remainder of the party that must have made his waking dreams very realistic.\n\nThe other remarkable thing about the Tahan River is that some one once announced he had counted the rapids and made them 99. This makes the head swim with wonder, first that anyone should think of counting the rapids at all, secondly, how he found out where one rapid ended and another began, and thirdly why he did not make the number 100. There is a story that another traveller shot a gibbon on the banks of the Tahan River and was punished by the Jins with madness which caused him to take his clothes off (where he took them off, or when, is not stated). Perhaps the counter of rapids committed a similar crime and was punished by being afflicted with a hypersensitive conscience which forbade him to reach the country.\n\nHaving arrived at Kuala Teku we found two men belonging to a party of Survey Coolies who had started up the mountain that day with a Trigonometrical beacon to be erected on the summit. One of the men left behind at the Kuala was suffering from dysentery. Fortunately I had a few tins of milk with me which I left with him, and, whether it was the milk that cured him or not, was glad to find on my return that he was well. We slept the night at Kuala Teku, and on the following morning started up to the first camp. This was a very short march, and I am convinced that the ascent of the mountain by this route could be done in shorter time by going farther the first day; but it had become the recognised thing to halt after only three hours climb, the excuse being water difficulties, and I was not in a position then to tell the men that we could reach water farther on.\n\nThe ascent to the first camp, where there was a large shed, erected by the 1905 expedition, is steep and somewhat slippery. This was the cause of an amusing and unusual sight. The survey coolies who had gone ahead of us had been warned that they should wear boots on account of the bare rocks on the high plateau-land of the range. They started with boots, but floundered about to such an extent on this soft slippery ground that they took them off, and, instead of carrying them with them, left them, hanging in the trees, a piece of folly that they bitterly regretted when they reached the top of the range. One man, I learned, was so overcome by having to carry an iron support while walking unshod over bare rocks, with abundant sharp quartz crystals, that he sat down and wept. I remember a similar occurrence near Kuantan, when a Malay whom I\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 62, 1912.\nwas trying to persuade to cut down a tree, work he had been hired to do, sat down and burst into tears, telling me that the axe was hurting his hands.\n\nThe jungle as far as the first camp seemed to be much the same as the jungle below, except for the abundance of a fine palm with broad leaves, useful for building huts. These the Malays called Pokok Dongkok. At the first camp, however, situated on the top of a spur, there was a marked change in the vegetation, things looking like conifers making their appearance. I have seen similar plants up other mountains in the States.\n\nThe view from the first camp was very fine. One could look over the broad tract of lowlying land drained by the Pahang River and also over the belt of hilly land formed by the great outcrop of quartzite and conglomerate, of which the Taban Range is part. Far away could be seen Gunong Sinyum, the huge limestone hill on the left bank of the Pahang River. Looking towards Gunong Tahan, big cliffs were visible which I was told by Bulang were on \"Gurong Gedong.\" I passed over no other mountain on my way to Gunong Tahan and gathered on my return that the name was merely a nickname bestowed by Malay coolies on part of Tahan, on account of its shape. The mention of this name as belonging to a distinct mountain unfortunately led me to a serious misconception as to the lay of the land at the time of my visit.\n\nAfter a comfortable night, broken only by the usual onslaught on Jeher, we set out again, plunging down into a ravine and rising on the other side to a long ridge separating the valley of the Toku, and, I believe, the Ulu of the Tahan River. We had to walk along this ridge to reach the elevated plateau-land of the range, some of which we could now see. How long this ridge is I hesitate to say, knowing how easy it is to exaggerate. Perhaps two miles would be near the figure, and were it not for the vegetation, I can quite believe that the passage might be a thrilling experience. The view was magnificent. On the right was a great curtain of vegetation in many hues of green falling away from the ridge with billowing undulations. On the left was the precipitous valley of the Toku with vertical cliffs that gave the impression of a huge canyon. On the other side of the valley was a great stretch of high, but plateau-like country of which Gunong Ulu Kechau is, I believe part. The valley of the Toku, as seen from the ridge, and from the high land beyond, is a sight of which I have never seen the equal in the Peninsula. The cliffs, the great depth of the canyon, and the waterfall at its head, mark it as something distinct from all the other valleys that I have seen during my travels in the Malay States, and it has always been a matter of regret that when I saw it I had no camera with me. It would be difficult to do justice to the scene, however, even with a camera. The rough sketches on Plate II will perhaps convey some idea of it.\n\nAt the end of the ridge a short scramble up a cliff brought us to the plateau-land. Here we left the big jungle behind us and found\nourselves in new surroundings. Low shrubs, the larger ones showing the influence of the strong winds, bare rock, and here and there a thin covering of peat, gave the impression of moorland, but in place of heather were strange bushes and the smaller plants were pitcher-plants, orchids and other things that I will not venture to name. One common orchid had a small pale-green flower, and I was much taken with a large bright yellow flower that I learned afterwards was a rare orchid found previously on Gunong Bubu. I do not remember seeing any rhododendrons, but as I would only be likely to notice the blossoms, there may have been hundreds of bushes.\n\nFrom the plateau we had a good view of Gunong Tahan (Fig. 1, Plate III) with fair sized trees in the shelter of a depression in the foreground. This I noticed elsewhere on this journey: that in gullies where the strong winds could not be felt the vegetation was bigger. The posts seen on the left of the sketch were put up by the 1905 expedition.\n\nLeaving the plateau-land we dropped into the valley of the Tuku above the waterfall and followed up the stream, jumping from boulder to boulder, until we arrived at a big pool at an elevation of about 5000 feet, where the Tuku was joined by a tributary. This was immediately below the ridge leading to the summit of the mountain, and here we camped for the night. I enjoyed a delightful bath in the cold water of the pool, but Mat Riflin was the only one of the Malays to join me.\n\nThe following morning a short climb brought us to the top of the ridge of Gunong Tahan. There is a little flat land even on the top of this ridge, but I doubt if it could be utilized. From the summit we could see another big mountain to the north, afterwards identified as Gunong Ulu Kamua, and to the west, far below us, a range of limestone hills that I judged must be the limestone hills marked on the Royal Asiatic Society\u2019s map in the Ulu of the Tanun. As it was evident that a clear view of the whole Tahan Range, or nearly the whole of it, could be obtained from these hills (the Cherual limestone hills, vide the Geology and Mining Industries of Ulu Pahang, Plate IV) I determined to visit them later on.\n\nDuring the return journey to the Kuala of the Tuku my men made a collection of the abundant quartz crystals that one finds scattered over the surface and in veins in the rock. They call them \u201cintan,\u201d and it is probable that these sparkling, but worthless stones, seen long ago by some forgotten Malay or aboriginal, are partly responsible for the Malay notion that the Jins on Gunong Tahan guarded a treasure of precious stones and gold. I might remark in passing that I have seen in the Ulu of the Tembeling a Jin who once lived on Gunong Tahan, but who was hurled down and turned into stone by the presiding Jin for insubordination.\n\nTHE TAHAN RANGE AS SEEN FROM THE CHERUAL LIMESTONE HILLS.\n\nIn July of 1906 I was able to visit the Cherual limestone hills, seen from the summit of Gunong Tahan. The journey up the S.\nTanun was made in a dug-out with a crew of Malays recruited in the neighbourhood of Kuala Tanun. This crew was the worst I have ever had. We arrived at our destination without serious mishap, however, and I landed at the little-known Kampong Cherual, not far from the Kelantan border. It consisted at that time, as far as I could discover, of only one house, therefore it was an easy matter to find the oldest inhabitant. He was an old, but still active Malay named Yusuf bin Sleiman, who had, he said, lived there for over twenty-five years. It was clear then that he was just the sort of man I wanted to tell me the names of the mountains and the course of the rivers in the neighbourhood, so I persuaded him to show me a way up the north end of the Cherual limestone hills to a spot where we had a magnificent view of the Tahan Range, and where I obtained the hill-sketch shown in Plate 1.\n\nThe names shown in this hill-sketch were all written down at the time of making the sketch at the dictation of Yusuf bin Sleiman, and I was careful to get him to look along the compass sights in order to avoid mistakes. The synonyms were given me by him also, but it is interesting to note that although the name Gunong Tahan was recognized, he and the other inhabitants called the mountain Gunong Rotan. They also knew it as Gunong Clu Tanun on account of the S. Tanun, so I was informed, rising on its flanks. This raises an interesting question about the Kelantan-Pahang boundary, which is determined by the watershed of the Kelantan and Pahang Rivers. The exact boundary will not be fixed until the country is surveyed in detail and it will probably be difficult to define on the west side of the Tahan Range, since the country between the Tanun and the Kelantan drainage is almost flat. The watershed runs about east and west, however, and is said by the Cherual Malays to follow on up to the summit of Gunong Ulu Kamua. On the west side of the range the drainage south of Gunong Ulu Kamua goes, they say, into the Tanun on the north and the Kechau on the south. The course of the Tanun near Cherual certainly supports this statement, and also the statement that it rises on Gunong Tahan. On the east, however, there is reason to suppose that the Kelantan-Pahang boundary runs southward along the Tahan Range as far as Gunong Tahan, and then turns eastward as the watershed of that great tributary of the Pahang River, the S. Tembeling.\n\nThe country between the Cherual limestone hills and the Tahan Range is gently undulating, and it appeared to me that a great mistake has been made in attacking the mountain from the Tembeling side. Waterstradt is the only traveller I know of, who has tried the ascent from the west, if I understand his account of his journey correctly. By this route one could be at the foot of the range in four days easily from Lipis, whereas the journey from Lipis to Kuala Teku takes at least six days. Moreover the Tanun has few rapids, whereas the Tahan is barely navigable for the smallest boats.\nTAHAN AS A HILL-STATION.\n\nThis comparison of routes leads on to the question of the utility of the Tahan Range as a hill-station. In an appendix to the account of the 1905 expedition in Vol. iii of the Journal of the F.M.S. Museums, I ventured to say that the range would make an ideal health station (p. 74). A reviewer found the remark a source of humour at the time, but now that the establishment of a health-station is actually being discussed, my critic, if still in the country, has probably changed his mind. Anyone who knows the cramped conditions of our existing hill stations would see quickly the enormous advantages of the Tahan Range; the great expanse of open and comparatively flat country, the elevation (between 4,000-5,000 feet), and the abundance of water. Instead of a monotonous walk along the same jungle paths day after day, shut in by huge trees, on the Tahan highland a delightful holiday would be possible roaming over a fair substitute for moors. Perhaps distance has tended to lend enchantment since 1906, but others who have visited the range seem to be of the same opinion as myself, with the result that, as already stated, the establishment of a hill-station is being discussed. The feasibility of the plan depends on the extension of the Pahang Railway, and I hope that that extension will pass between the Cherul limestone hills and the Tahan Range, connecting with a funicular railway up to the highlands.\n\nGUNONG RIAM\n\nGunong Tahan, far away from roads and, at present, from a railway, has been visited by few Europeans, and even seen by few Europeans. Gunong Riam, better known as Gunong Kerbau, on the other hand, is a familiar sight to dwellers in Kinta, raising its sharply outlined ridge high above the little town of Tanjong Rambutan and plainly visible from the greater part of the district. He would be an unobservant traveller, who on a clear day failed to notice its giant form while passing Tanjong Rambutan in the mail-train.\n\nAlthough deprived of its pride of place as the supposed highest mountain in the Peninsula, Gunong Riam always attracted me as a climb for several reasons, and in February of this year (1912) I made the ascent. Since my trip to Tahan I had climbed Ulu Kali in Selangor and Berembun in Perak, but a long interval had elapsed since the last long mountain trip, which perhaps was the reason that I relied on a Malay Penghulu to make necessary preparations for me at Tanjong Rambutan, so that I might go to the town by train and start up the mountain without delay. The Penghulu was approached through the proper channel and promised to have a guide, men, and elephants ready on a certain day. I had been told that elephants were always taken part of the way and therefore asked the Penghulu to hire them, although travelling with them is to court misery. On the appointed day I proceeded to Tanjong\nRambutan and found nothing whatever ready. I then had to make my own arrangements, and having heard, fortunately, that elephants could go but a short part of the way, looked out for a guide and men only. Five days later a heavy fee had secured a guide, who left his work to accommodate me, and six Malays to carry baggage, including a small tent. Everything was ready by 8 a.m. and having already committed one foolish mistake by putting my trust in a Penghulu, I proceeded to make another by allowing the six men to go by a so-called short cut over a hill, while Midin, the guide, and myself, with a Chinese boy and a Malay employee, took the regular route up the Kinta River. We were to camp that night near Kuala Termin, a short march but a recognized halting-place, like the first camp on the way to Tahan. Never shall I forget that day. The details would be painful to relate: suffice it to say that after waiting four hours for the men to emerge from their \"short-cut,\" I found them cooking rice by the side of the Kinta River, and, of course, complaining about the weight of the baggage. The rice was not eaten. After this experience I displayed a fondness for the society of these Malays that surprised them, and they were always in front of me until the last day of the descent. One of these gentlemen appears in Fig. 1 of Plate IV. The size of the bundle he is carrying is worth nothing. He was an ex-police man, I was not surprised to hear it.\n\nThe camp near Kuala Termin was only about 700 feet above Tanjong Rambutan and situated on the right bank of the Kinta River. Midin was expecting some Senoi men to join us there and had asked me to bring tobacco and rice to give to them as pay. The Senoi, five of them, were there on our arrival, and helped themselves liberally to the articles mentioned and then went home. The necessity of six Malays and five Senoi had not dawned on me when this happened, but nevertheless the conduct of these men, whom we never saw again, and could not trace to their houses, seemed reprehensible. However, by the following morning Midin had caught three others, and we set out up the Termin a party of thirteen. The Malays, as usual, when Senoi men are with them, made the latter carry the greater part of the baggage. It was as well, because if I had had the Malays only we would never have arrived at the top.\n\nOn the second day we passed by a Chinese tin-stealers' kongsi, and then rose to 2,900 feet above Tanjong Rambutan, camping by the Batu Salik, a huge mass of granite with a small gully close by wherein is the cross erected in memory of J. A. A. Williams, who had ascended the mountain and died from fever on that spot in 1892. The march to Batu Salik was another short march, and on the following day I had the prospect of getting the men up the remaining four thousand odd feet in one march. It does not sound difficult of accomplishment, but anyone who had seen my Malays would have understood my anxiety. We started at 8 a.m. and I arranged that the men were to climb five hundred feet at a time.\nwith a rest of five minutes between each instalment. Shortly after leaving camp one of the men sat down, but got up again when the programme was explained to him. It proved an excellent plan, for we arrived at the Trigonometrical Survey beacon on the summit at 12.40.\n\nVery soon after leaving Batu Salik we emerged from the dense jungle onto the ridge marked by the dotted line in Fig. 2 of Plate III, which leads up to the summit. The vegetation on this ridge is low and in several places one can walk along enjoying a perfect view on either side over the bushes (vide the foreground in Fig. 1 of Plate IV). On other parts of the ridge, however, we plunged through vegetation such as that shown in Fig. 2 of Plate IV and there was one part where we walked in a bower of mosses hanging from the short trunks and branches of stunted trees.\n\nThe most noticeable point about the vegetation was the abundance of rhododendrons and large pitcher plants. A bunch of rhododendrons is shown in Fig. 2 of Plate IV. As I write this I am in England and I was very interested on landing in comparing garden rhododendrons with those I saw on Riam. The flowers of the garden plants are perhaps a little finer individually, and they certainly grow in larger clusters. On account of the small size of the plants compared with the Malayan examples they make a better show of bloom, but the rhododendrons on Riam are nevertheless a beautiful sight and with judicious pruning could probably be greatly improved.\n\nThere were several other strange flowers, including a ground orchid, but nothing of much note as far as beauty was concerned. A very slender bamboo occurs that is probably the famous Malayan \"Bulu berindu\", but I have never heard a Malay admit the identity, although I have seen this slender bamboo elsewhere. Nor have I ever succeeded in persuading a Malay to take a piece down to a Kampong to try the affect. I remember once that after seeing the bamboo on another mountain I discussed the matter with one of the men. He decided that the bamboo we had seen could not be the \"Bulu berindu\" because it was so easy to obtain. The real \"Bulu berindu\" always had thunderstorms and thick clouds around it, while dragons and other ferocious creatures guarded the approaches. I met no dragons on Riam.\n\nFig. 1 of Plate IV shows the beacon on the summit of Riam. As can be seen from the photograph the mountain is an exposed place on which to camp and I do not remember many more uncomfortable nights than that spent there. The weather was unfavourable. It was clear when we arrived, but about 2 p.m. it began to rain and blow and continued doing so until 10 p.m. My tent was slung under the beacon but the cold wind found me out, and even after 10 p.m. it was bitterly cold. I put on two flannel shirts and my jungle clothes, including boots and putties, and crept under two blankets but still felt chilled. At 4 p.m. the temperature was 58 Fahr. What it dropped to afterwards I do not know, as I was too\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 62, 1912\ncold to get out of bed and look. Judging from the comparative comfort of sleeping in the open, and on the ground, in another country when the thermometer showed 12\u00b0 of frost, the minimum on Riam that night might have been zero, but I do not suppose it fell below 54\u00b0 Fahr.\n\nI am unable to describe the magnificence of the view from Riam. I doubt if anyone could do justice to it. The great peaks around me in the main range of the Peninsula, and the cloud-filled valleys made a far grander panorama than the view from Tahan. One thing I will try to describe. Some time after midnight I woke up and saw the Southern Cross shining brightly. Later a crescent moon and a brilliant planet rose, showing up the dark outlines of Gunong Gyang and Yang Blar. Then these paled as the dawn broke and masses of pink clouds became visible in the valleys. The light grew in the east with a wonderful glow of red and orange, and, to my delight, showed up with perfect definition the distant Tahan Range as a black silhouette against the coming sunrise. The range was far, far away, but so clearly was it seen that it might have been a tiny ridge but a mile or so distant. Then as the sun rose above the horizon, the Tahan range disappeared in a shimmering blue haze, and the glory of the morning lit up all the surrounding peaks. I have never seen anything to equal that sunrise on Gunong Riam, and do not expect to see anything to equal it, but words cannot describe it adequately.\n\nI have referred to this mountain as Riam although it is generally known as \"Kerbau,\" and must now explain why. I had heard long ago that Riam was the correct Malay name but had also been told that a \"Kerbau\" had nothing to do with a water-buffalo, but was a corruption of a Senoi word meaning mountain, so that \"Gunong Kerbau\" would mean simply \"Mountain Mountain.\" This I thought might explain the appearance on the new map, published by the Society, of the name \"Korbu\" for this mountain, which I had not heard before; but I learned from Midin, who had been up the hill on three previous occasions, and the Senoi men, that I was on the wrong track. The local Senoi word for mountain is, I was told, \"Jelmul,\" which cannot possibly be connected with \"Kerbau\" or \"Korbu.\" The Malay name for this mountain is \"Riam\" and always has been so; but once many years ago a Frenchman, not knowing this, ascended the mountain from Sungei Siput by a route following a stream called the S. Kerbau and therefore called the mountain \"Gunong Kerbau.\" Hence, if my information is correct, \"Gunong Kerbau\" is a misnomer of French origin. I have some old literature that leads me to suspect the identity of the Frenchman, but the matter is not of sufficient importance to discuss here.\n\nOn our way down from the mountain we had an amusing experience at the tin-stealers' Kongsi, where we slept for the night. The tin-stealers had decamped at our approach and we found a commodious house wherein to cook our food, dry clothes, and rest.\nBut we thought it likely that the Chinese tenants might return at night to enter into possession again, not knowing we had elected to remain, and therefore, when about 10 p.m. we were aroused by a shout outside and the light of a torch, there was some excitement. I sat up and saw a fierce looking man advance and shake the bamboo door violently. He had a large spear with him, and I quickly realized that he was a Senoi. Then when the door was opened as romantic a group of human beings came in as could be imagined. The first to enter was the man with the spear. He also had a blowpipe, and was a short, thick-set, middle-aged man with a fine though savage face, who came in unconcernedly and sat down by the remnants of a fire. After him came two little children, two minute dots of savagery with timid mien and hesitating steps. Last came the mother, a by no means uncomely Senoi lady, left to straggle in as she thought fit. What this family was doing abroad in the jungle at night I do not know. They spent the night in the Kongsi and went their own way next morning.\n\nThe Senoi youth in Fig. 2 of Plate IV was one of the men who came with me. I photographed him as an exceptionally pleasant type of savage. Some of my anthropological friends, if they saw him, might say that his pleasantness, and cleanliness showed the contamination of civilization. For myself, the pleasanter and cleaner a savage is, the better I like him.\n\nAs a possible health resort Riam is useless, as it consists of one sharp waterless ridge. As a mountain well worth visiting, however, I commend Gunong Riam to all who drive in Kinta. Two days good walking from Tanjong Rambutan should bring one to the top, and although Malays may talk of the natural difficulties of the journey, no one but a cripple would be stopped by them. The only difficulty is the transport of baggage, and if anyone determines to ascend the mountain, I would advise them to send for Senoi from the Ulu of the Kinta, who would also act as guides. The Malays of the neighbourhood are not very much use, although I must say that one man with me worked well for his wages. Apart from transport troubles I regard the ascent of Riam as the easiest climb I have had in the Peninsula.\n\nCOMPARISON OF THE STRUCTURE OF GUNONG TAHAN, GUNONG RIAM AND OTHER PENINSULAR MOUNTAINS.\n\nIn conclusion I will deal very briefly with the structure of Gunong Tahan, Gunong Riam, and other mountains in the main range. It is common knowledge that the main range is mostly composed of granite. Granite is a rock that solidified at a considerable depth from the surface. In the case of the main range of the Peninsula the granite rose in a molten state in the crust before solidifying, the rise being rendered possible by the folding of stratified rocks above into an arch, or anticline, of great length. Two at least of these anticlines were formed at the same time, or\nabout the same time, which I have called the Main Range Anticline, and the Benom Anticline. As these arches were formed, much of the rock fell into the molten granite, but when the latter consolidated, stratified rocks remained above. Much later in the earth's history denudation laid bare the granite cores below the remains of these anticlines, carving out the main range and the Benom range. In time denudation will cut down into these granite masses. How far have they cut down already?\n\nIt is obvious that at some period of the process of denudation the highest peaks would show remains of the superincumbent stratified rocks. At such a time a large part of the surface of the granite core would be visible. In the case of the main range there is some reason to suppose from the evidence of the distribution of tin-deposits that denudation has not gone far beyond this surface of the core of granite, and it is very interesting to find, as de Morgan noted in the eighties, that the summit of Riam is composed of altered stratified rocks, phyllites and quartzite. On this, the highest peak of the main range, there is then a remnant of the superincumbent stratified rocks, corroborating the other evidence of denudation not having advanced far into the granite mass. I expect too that stratified rocks will be found on Gunong Gyang, on Yang Blar, and other high peaks in the neighbourhood. We may regard these rocks on Riam as a remnant of the \"lid of the Peninsula,\" which, when removed, revealed the vast wealth of tin-ore below.\n\nRiam; then preserves for us a portion of this lid. Lower peaks in the main range that I have ascended, Gunong Ulu Kali and Gunong Berambun, have been stripped of these rocks and show granite only, as far as we know.\n\nGunong Tahan however, and the Tahan range generally, although connected with this folding, fall into a different category. A glance at the map shows that the Benom Anticline lies parallel to the Main Range Anticline. Between the two anticlines the east limb of the latter and the west limb of the former meet, and when they meet we find a range of hills formed of quartzite and conglomerate. These rocks are the younger members of the two arches, and we expect to find them of course on the east side of Benom as part of the east limb of the Benom Anticline. They are there, forming a great belt of hilly country striking through the centre of Pahang and including the Tahan range, which is on the western border of this belt.\n\nThe Tahan range, then, including Gunong Tahan, is part of one of the two great arches.\n\nGunong Riam is capped by a small remnant of the other of the two arches, but is chiefly composed of granite.\n\nGunong Ulu Kali, Berembun, and the majority of the peaks in the main range, as far as we know, retain no trace of the arch, but consist of the solid granite core only.\n\nJoar Straits Branch\n2.

Civil Service\n\nWith Plates V. and VI.\n\nThe three keris illustrated in Plate V, different views of two of which may be seen in Plate VI, are probably the earliest authenticated specimens in any English collection. To describe them briefly. The keris on the left, a curving blade with 13 lok, has a hilt showing the features of a European in a helmet and chain gorget, features as caricatured as is the portrait of the Dutchman in the folk-tale of Anggun che Tunggul:\n\nG\u00e9rham-nya empal sa-rumpun;\nSa-gantang makan daging;\nDua chupak l\u00e9kat di gigi-nya.\n\nThe small keris in the centre of Plate V and on the left of Plate VI has a hilt carved with the Javanese representation of some demi-god from the wayang kulit cycle, possibly Arjuna; probably, any Javanese could identify it, though writing in England I have no means to discover. It is to be noted that the angle of the hilt follows the conventional attitude of the Jawa demam or cobra-headed Malay hilt, the evolution of which is and probably will remain unsolved. It may be remarked, that the high forehead of Javanese demi-gods would seem to point to this artistic type deriving from a people among whom binding of the head was a custom.\n\nThe third keris, which is illustrated only in Plate V is interesting for several reasons:\u2014the blade, by the bye, is damasked and has eleven lok. The hilt preserves the conventional angle of the Jawa demam; the long-nosed figure (the nose unfortunately has been broken off) with its row of teeth has a striking affinity with the still longer nosed figure on Patani keris hilts, but the back of its head is carved with hair like that of the last keris. And it is to be noted that the curved conventional ornament round mouth and chin is almost identical with that round mouth and chin of the Javanese demi-god.\n\nThese three keris are now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and belong to the old Tradescant Collection, which dates from the beginning of the 17th century.\n\nJohn Tradescant the elder is said by Anthony \u00e0 Wood to have been a Dutchman, but was probably English even in his name, of which other variants were Tradeskin and Tredekin. He and his son of the same name were travellers, naturalists and gardeners and introduced into England the lilac, acacia, occidental plane and possibly the pine-apple. In the service of George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, the father dealt \"with all merchants from all places but especially from Virginia, Bermudas, New-\nKeris in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.\n\nEmrose, Collo., Derby.\nfoundland, Guinea, Binney, the Amazon and the East Indies for all manner of rare beasts fowls and birds shells and stones.\" On Buckingham's death, he seems to have entered the service of the king and queen and probably at that date established his physic garden and museum at the east side of South Lambeth Road, leading from Vauxhall to Stockwell. He was the first in England who \"made any considerable collection of the subjects of natural history.\" He died 1637-1638. The son succeeded the father as gardener to Queen Henrietta Maria, and was also a traveller. In 1656 resolving \"to take a catalogue of those rarities and curiosities which my father had sedulously collected\" he published his Museum Tradescantianum. This book in its 179 pages contains lists of birds, shells, fishes, insects, minerals, fruits, war instruments, habits, utensils, coins and medals. Among entries of other warlike instruments from Japan, Turkey, India, China, Canada, Virginia, Ginny, Persia, and Muscovy occurs the entry on page 46 of \"Poisoned creeses or Daggers, two wavel two plain\"\u2014apparently one of the plain has been lost. In 1659 Tradescant and his wife sealed and delivered a deed of gift of this collection of rarities to Sir Thomas Ashmole, but his will of date 1661 bequeathed the collection to his wife for life and after her decease to \"the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge to which of them she shall think fit.\" There was a law-suit and Ashmole got the collection \"to have and enjoy.\" In 1677 Ashmole offered it to Oxford as soon as a building should be erected to receive it. In 1683 Wren finished a building and the collection went to Oxford in 'barges', and \"the name of Tradescant was unjustly sunk in that of Ashmole.\" Ashmole, of course, was not a traveller, but Windsor herald and author of a book on the order of the Garter.\n\nThe old M.S catalogue of the Tradescant collection compiled in 1685 by Edward Lhwyd, first Assistant Keeper of the Ashmolean and still preserved in the archives of the museums contains entries of several creeses vaguely described and an attempt at exact description of the little demi-god hilted keris: \"117 Pugio anceps in mucronem exit, manubrium simiae imaginem exprimit: a double-edged, dagger tapering to a point,\u2014its handle exhibiting the figure of an ape.\" The vagina lignea or wooden scabbard has been lost.\n\nThe official catalogue of the Ashmolean Collection of 1836 has the entries\n\n32 Two Malay creeses or daggers with waved blades. Mus. Tradesc.\n33 Another with straight blade. Mus. Tradesc.\n\nSo we have the history of these three keris established practically beyond doubt back to the early years of the XVIth century. I am indebted to Mr. E. T. Leeds, formerly of the F. M. S. Civil Service and now Assistant Keeper of the Ashmolean Museum for calling my attention to these weapons, getting them photographed for me and putting the Catalogues cited at my disposal.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 62, 1912.\nMount Ophir Legends.\n\nBy Dr. Mildred E. Staley.\n\nI. In No. 60 of this Journal there is an interesting account of Malacca by Barretto de Resende.\n\nIn connection with the last part of it, regarding Gunong Ledang (Mount Ophir), the following notes may be of interest.\n\nLately, when visiting Kampongs at the base of the mountain, I obtained the modern, 1912, version of the story.\n\nIn a cave which is brilliantly illuminated by scintillating lights, lives the Queen-Goddess or Sorceress, variously described as a \"Bidadhari,\" \"Perempuan Sakti\" etc. There she is waited upon by \"Spirits of the air\" (called formerly Bennas,) demons, and a tiger who is her familiar, into whom she can at will project herself.\n\nShe resents all attempts of Malays to climb the mountain, but English (orang puteh) are exempt from her anger, because it has not struck her they would ever wish to remain on the mountain! Hence also, Malays are suffered to ascend temporarily when acting as guides.\n\nAll animals bow down to her, and her tiger has a sense of smell so keen that he can inform her at once when a party commences to ascend. The Sorceress then retires into her cave, which eye of man has never seen, or mayhap she is pleased to enter the tiger.\n\nOnce long, long ago, the last Sultan but one (? Ala-e-din), wished to make friends with the Sorceress, and sent from Malacca ambassadors, dressed in fresh odoriferous tiger skins, to offer her marriage on his own behalf. Her reply was that she would accept the offer only when the Sultan fulfilled the following requirements.\n\nFirst, he must build a bridge of solid gold from the top of her mountain to the Malacca Hill, whereby she might be suitably conveyed across.\n\nSecondly, the Sultan must send her 10,000 mosquitos' hearts as a present.\n\nThirdly he must send a cupful of his own blood.\n\nThe Sultan replied that he was rich enough to build the bridge of gold, and that 10,000 mosquitos' hearts were easy to supply, but to give of his heart's blood was quite impossible. So the negotiations fell through. Before ascending the mountain, a counter spell supplied by the village Pawang at considerable expense, is a necessity for a Malay who is willing to brave the Hantus, jins, and malevolent demons of the mountain.\n\nAn enlightened Mohammedan Malay of the neighbourhood, whose child's life we had saved in a dangerous illness, when pressed to speak openly, confessed his firm belief that the mountain was the resort of demons, saying, \"There would not be all these stories without reality behind them.\"\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nIt will be noted that the many tigers formerly infesting the mountain, are now reduced to one. No doubt when a good road up has been constructed, and Mount Ophir is a favorite Sanitarium for the sick and tired inhabitants of Negri Sembilan and Malacca districts, the Sorceress and all the demons will betake themselves elsewhere.\n\nII. In reference to the \"Saletes\" (orang-laut), mentioned in the appendix, I have occasionally seen their present day descendants in the art, spearing their fish in deep water just as it was done of old. The javelin, attached by thin twine to the wrist, is thrown with sure and powerful aim by the fisherman, standing not in a boat, but on some miniature pier or \"water-machan\" of bamboo, built into the sea.\n\nIII. In connection with Goddesses, it may be of interest to report that one day in a distant Kampong, I found the Malays busy propitiating the celebrated Hindu Goddess of Smallpox, Sita.\n\nI was familiar with her chief shrine, to be found near Gurgaon, Punjab, which is yearly visited by crowds of pilgrims from all over Northern and Central India.\n\nIn this case, the familiar ceremonies were being performed by a Hindu fakir (holy man) in orange garments, bearing on his forehead the three-fold upright marks of Civa the Destroyer, assisted by two followers chanting appropriate mantras to a small mud image of the \"Slaying One.\" With simple faith, the people paid heavily for this attempt to avert the epidemic.\n\nOne was reminded of the saying (Rg Veda) \"They speak of Mitra, Varuna, Agni;\u2014that which Is and is One, the poets call in various ways.\"\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 62, 1912.\nMosquito Larvae and Freshwater Fish.\n\nBy Dr. R. Hanitsch.\n\nThe following pages contain a Report which I prepared, at the request of Government, upon the possible usefulness of the small fish *Haplochilus panchax*, the 'Ikan mata lalat' of the Malays, in keeping down Mosquito larvae and consequently Malaria, as the fish 'Millions' of Barbados is said to do.\n\nThe island of Barbados enjoys a remarkable immunity from fever, and two or three years ago, when the reason of this was put down to the presence in enormous numbers, on the island, of a certain fish which feeds on small crustaceans and insects, including mosquito larvae, the Colonial Office decided to try the experiment of distributing that fish among the various tropical Colonies, to ascertain if it might be of any service in checking Malaria in other places as well. This fish, the 'Millions' (*Girardinus peciloides*, de Filippi *), so called on account of the enormous numbers in which it occurs in Barbados, is only a small species, according to G\u00fcnther, about $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inches in length, and belongs to the family Cyprinodontidae.\n\nThe Zoological Society of London, together with the Agricultural Department of Barbados, declared itself willing to help in the experiment and in the distribution of the Fish, though there was some scepticism as to whether the experiment would be a success.\u2020 However, as a closely allied fish, *Haplochilus panchax*, the 'Ikan mata lalat' of the Malays, occurs in the Malay region, it was thought that before introducing here the 'Millions' of Barbados, it should be ascertained whether the *Haplochilus panchax* might not be as effective in checking Mosquito larvae, and I was accordingly asked to investigate the matter.\n\nRaffles Museum and Library\n\nSingapore.\n\n15th May, 1912.\n\nTo the Hon'ble The Colonial Secretary, S.S.\n\nSir,\n\nIn accordance with your minute of 21-3-1912 (H. C. 2043) I have the honour to submit herewith a Report on the distribution and habits of the fish *Haplochilus panchax*, H. B.\n\n---\n\n* G\u00fcnther (Brit. Mus Catal. Fishes, Vol. VI, p. 856) and D. S. Jordan and B. N. Evermann (The Fishes of North and Middle America, Vol. I, p. 689) refer to it under the name *Lebiasa peciloides*.\n\n\u2020 See letter of Captain J. A. M. Vipan in Proceedings, Zoological Society, 1910, pp. 146-147.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nAs the object of the enquiry is to ascertain whether the fish might be of the same use as the fish \"Millions\" (Girardinus paecloides) of Barbados in keeping down mosquito larvae and consequently malaria, it would have served no purpose if I had restricted my enquiry to that one species of fish, and I have therefore attempted to collect species of all freshwater fish in the neighbourhood of the town of Singapore, and have made experiments as to whether they feed on mosquito larvae or not.\n\nObviously only the smallest species of freshwater fish were found in the small ditches, and of these Haplochilus panchax, the \"Ikan mata lalat\" of the Malays, seemed to be the most common. Like the \"Millions\" of Barbados, it belongs to the family Cyprinodontidae, which, according to G\u00fcnther, includes the smallest fish known. It grows to only about 2\" in length, but notwithstanding its small size it is probably the best known of the local freshwater fish, not so much on account of its numbers, as from the very conspicuous bright silvery spot on the top of its head. It is of slow moving habits, and generally keeps close to the surface of the water. We found it in the following places:\u2014junction of River Valley Road and Leonie Hill Road; Tanglin Road; Botanic Gardens; off Orange Grove Road; Kim Kiat Road; Syed Ali Road; Gaylang Road; Teluk Blangah Road, but it could be found in almost any ditch capable of holding fish. It eats mosquito larvae, but not greedily.\n\nAnother small species, also common, though less so than the previous one, is the Hemirhamphus fluviatilis, Bleeker (Ikan jolong jolong). It is an ally of the Gar-Pike and the Flying fish, and it is easily recognised by its lower jaw being drawn out into a long beak. It grows to about 2\u00bd\" in length, and was found in the following places:\u2014junction of River Valley Road and Leonie Hill Road; Orange Grove Road; Tanglin Road; Jervois Road; Kim Kiat Road; Teluk Blangah Road. It is a delicate fish, not always surviving the journey to the Museum. It is herbivorous, living on Algae and Waterweeds, and does not eat mosquito larvae.*\n\nA great favourite amongst sporting natives is the Fighting Fish (Betta pugnax, Cantor), or \"Ikan pelaga\". It grows to about 3\u00bd\". It has a large ventral fin, drawn out to a point posteriorly, and its colour is a dull purple, which, however, changes into dazzling metallic colours when the fish is excited. It is very active, and ate mosquito larvae greedily within a few seconds of their being given to it. We found it in Somerset Road; Jervois Road; Moulmein Road; and in large numbers, especially, in the pond at the junction of Syed Ali Road and Thompson Road, which is being filled up at present.\n\nA larger fish than any of these above is the \"Ikan sepat\" (Osphromenus trichopterus, Pall.), belonging to the same family as\n\n* I have since repeated the experiment with the same result, and this fish seems to be the only one of those I examined which does not eat mosquito larvae.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 62, 1912.\nthe Fighting Fish, viz. the Labyrinthici. It is edible, but is much less valued than Gurami (Osphromenus olfax) which for the table is regarded as the best of the local freshwater fishes. The Ikan sepat grows to about 4\", and is distinguished by its beautiful iridescent colours and its ventral fin being transformed into a long thread-like ray, often reaching beyond the tail. It has two round black spots on either side, which are very marked in the young. We caught it in Orchard Road (in the ditch in front of the Police Station), in Jervois Road, Somerset Road, Syed Ali Road, and noticed it also in the swamps near Teluk Blangah Road. The young ate mosquito larvae, though not ravenously, whilst full grown specimens seemed to despise them.\n\nTo the same family belongs the \"Ikan betok\" or Climbing Perch (Anabas scandens, Dald.) The largest specimens we found measured about 4\u00bd\", though, according to Cantor, it grows up to 7\". This fish can live a long time out of water, and it is well ascertained that it can travel on land, pushing itself along by its fins. We caught it off Gaylang Road, and noticed it in the swamps at Teluk Blangah. The young ones ate mosquito larvae greedily. No experiments were made with full grown specimens.\n\nThe 'Ikan aruan' (Ophiocephalus stratus, Bl.), belonging to the family of Ophiocephalidae, is also able to live out of water and to travel over damp grass. It is much eaten, and grows, according to Duncker, to about 2\u00bd feet in length. The young ones, of which we caught some at Syed Ali Road, are of a golden orange colour, and ate mosquito larvae greedily. We saw the same fish at Teluk Blangah.\n\nThe Catfish, or \"Ikan keli\" (Clarias magur, H. B.), occurs in many places in Singapore Island, such as the Botanic Gardens, Syed Ali Road, Teluk Blangah Road, but no experiments were made with it.*\n\nThe above enumerated fishes seem to be the more common ones in the neighbourhood of Singapore town. Whilst collecting them we were constantly on the look out for mosquito larvae (Malay name \"jentek-jentek\"), and it must be stated that, perhaps with one exception, no mosquito larvae were found in any great numbers in places in which there were fish or which were easily accessible to fish.\n\nFor instance I had expected to find many mosquito larvae in the swampy district between Killiney Road, Devonshire Road, and\n\n* I may add a few words, as I have since been able to get additional material, from Lavender Street. The Catfish, thus called from the eight long barbules which arise from around its mouth and have some resemblance to a cat's whiskers, lives in muddy water and is a very active and shy fish. It grows, according to Cantor, to at least 1\u00bd feet in length, but experiments were naturally made only with small specimens, one to two inches in length, such as would be likely to feed on mosquito larvae. The first experiments were quite negative in result, and only after the fish had been kept on short rations for a couple of days, did it begin to eat mosquito larvae. Its usual diet seems to be decaying animal and vegetable matter.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nSomerset Road, but discovered them (those of *Culex*) only in a single pool, and that contained no fish. I then examined the compound of a European house in Killiney Road, which is unoccupied at present, and found the place littered with old tins full of the larv\u00e6 of the Tiger Mosquito (*Stegomyia fasciata*).\n\nAn examination of certain pools off Gaylang Road showed striking results, from which, however, it might be rash to generalize. The pools were at the edge of the mangrove zone, they were numerous, and had been formed to a great extent as depressions between the mounds of the Cray-fish *Thalassina anomala*, which is so common in such localities. One of the pools was thick and black with mosquito larv\u00e6 (*Culex*), but contained no fish; another pool, only about a yard off, was free from larv\u00e6, but contained fish (Ikan mata lalat).\n\nWe also examined the most malarial region in Singapore, the swamps of Teluk Blangah, and found mosquito larv\u00e6 in the following situations: in empty tins lying about; in freshly formed pools at the top of the reclamation; in a small pool, at a level with the main pool, which contained only a single specimen of a fish (Ikan mata lalat); and, finally, we found numbers of the larv\u00e6 of *Anopheles* in the dense masses of waterweed in the largest pool there, the weed being so thick that probably no fish could penetrate it. Besides, the weed was so full of other minute animal life, that, even if a fish had penetrated there, he could scarcely have been expected to devote himself entirely to the mosquito larv\u00e6. The open and clean stretches of water in the pool contained several species of fish (Ikan mata lalat, Ikan jolong-jolong, Ikan betok, Ikan sepat, Ikan aruan and Ikan kelii), but we did not notice any mosquito larv\u00e6 there.\n\nThe pond at the junction of Syed Ali Road and Thomson Road, which is being filled up at present, certainly contained mosquito larv\u00e6 (*Culex*) in places which seemed quite accessible to the numerous fish in it, but the general microscopic life there was so abundant that there was no need for any fish to restrict its diet to mosquito larv\u00e6 especially.\n\nWhether the fish \"Millions\", if imported into such a locality, would show a marked predilection for mosquito larv\u00e6, is doubtful. It is also uncertain whether it would be able to hold its own against these several species of fish indigenous to Singapore Island. In Barbados it is only the freshwater fish known (see Captain Vipan's letter in Proc. Zoological Society, February 1910, pp. 146-147), and it may not be equal to the competition with any other fish. However, as the Agricultural Department of Barbados has arranged to send from time to time consignments of \"Millions\" to the Zoological Gardens, London, from there to be distributed through the Colonial Office to various tropical Colonies, the experiment of bringing some to Singapore should be easy and inexpensive, best perhaps on a troopship in charge of the ship's surgeon. But it must be remembered that to introduce an animal into another part of the\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 62, 1912.\nworld always brings the risk of the accidental introduction of some other and undesirable organism. In the meantime it seems advisable to fill up all large pools in the neighbourhood of the town, or, if this is not feasible, to clean them of all surplus vegetation, and to introduce into them small species of fish such as are known to feed on mosquito larvae, like the \"Ikan mata lalat\" and especially the \"Ikan pelaga\".\n\nHowever, there must be in a town like Singapore many localities in which Anopheles and other mosquitos breed, and which are quite inaccessible to fish, and by far the greater area of the town would probably not be touched at all by preventive measures, such as the introduction of fish. If, as I know from my own experience, Anopheles, besides Culex and Stegomyia, may practically any day be found in a comparatively healthy part such as Fort Canning Road, then an attempt to exterminate malaria by means of fish in the crowded central districts of the town would be utterly hopeless. But the experiment might be of use in the outskirts of the town.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nR. Hanitsch,\nDirector.\nPopulation of the Straits Settlements and Malay Peninsula during the last Century\n\nBy H. Marriott.\n\nI have collected in the annexed tables statistics of the population according to race and sex for the Colony, and according to sex for the Malay States.\n\nSo far as the Colony is concerned the figures are probably accurate from 1871 onwards. Before that date the censuses were taken by the police at somewhat irregular intervals and are not very reliable.\n\nBetween 1822 and 1836 the figures have been derived from Mr. Newbold's \"British Settlements in the Straits of Malacca.\" From 1836 to 1860 I have been unable to get many figures, and from that date they are taken from the Census Reports. With regard to the Federated Malay States, no reliable data are to be procured previous to 1891, and for the other Protected States the Census Returns for 1911 are the first of any practical importance.\n\nIt may however be of interest to add here the following estimate of the population of the States of the Peninsula in the years 1835-1836 given by Mr. Newbold in the work quoted above.\n\n| State          | Population |\n|----------------|------------|\n| Perak          | 35,000     |\n| Selangor       | 12,000     |\n| Rembau         | 9,000      |\n| Sungei Ujong   | 3,600      |\n| Johol          | 3,080      |\n| Jempol         | 2,000      |\n| Jelebu         | 2,000      |\n| Sri Menanti    | 8,000      |\n| Pahang         | 40,000     |\n| Johore         | 25,000     |\n| Kedah & Ligor  | 50,000     |\n| Kelantan       | 50,000     |\n| Trengganu      | 30,000     |\n| Kemamam        | 1,000      |\n| Patani         | 10,000     |\n| Aborigines     | 9,000      |\n\nR.

This enchanted land is inhabited by a great and powerful race, who own allegiance to none but their own appointed chief\u2014the dread Rajah of the Interior and Ruler of many thousands of fierce warriors; rumour details further how these people have a wonderful system of irrigation by which they always live in plenty since they gain a second crop of paddy during the year; how by means of natural salt-springs they obtain salt\u2014their chief necessity of life, and so become entirely self-supporting and have no need of intercourse with the outside world; how further they make their own gunpowder, and how they keep large herds of a curious kind of goat. To this country, situated right in the centre of northern Borneo\u2014the source of all the great rivers of Sarawak, viz., the Trusan, the Limbang, the Baram and the Rejang, whence rise also two great rivers of Dutch Borneo, viz., the Batang Kayan and the Koti\u2014to this country, but few from the Limbang district ever penetrate, and, absit omen, whence fewer still return.\n\nThus the gist of the various native yarns to be gathered from those living on and about the lower waters of the great Limbang River, a branch of which runs through the ancient city of Brunei, at one time, as we all know, the flourishing capital of Borneo.\n\nMany of their tales centred on one particular mountain, Batu Lawi by name, which was said to stand up smooth and straight like the post of a house, towering to an enormous height, without a vestige of vegetation on it, and with its glistening white cliffs rising sheer, thereby presenting an unclimbable surface to any fool-hardy explorer. \"But surely,\" I protested \"there must be some small ridges or inequalities which would afford one a foothold or hand-grip so that one could at least get up a little way?\" \"Oh no,\" they said, \"and unless the Tuan can walk up the wall of a house like a fly, he won't be able to get up Batu Lawi!\" Added to which there were of course numerous stories relating to the power of this wonderful mountain, how few people were ever allowed to get there, how those that did either met some dreadful fate there or else died shortly after their return, while others went\nso far as to assert that even to point at the mountain with one's hand would incur its just worth, which the mountain would show at once by causing heavy rain to fall.\n\nSuch stories, I suppose, so far from acting as a deterrent to the majority of white men, would rather stimulate their curiosity, so that should occasion offer, they would endeavour to learn more of these curious rumours, of the extent of truth in them, of the possibility of verifying them. Well, the present writer does not claim to be an exception to the average and the result of hearing these vague rumours was a careful hunt through available literature for any more definite information on the subject, before taking a journey there himself. What little there was forthcoming is soon told.\n\n**Historical.**\n\nIn 1858 Sir Spenser St. John at that time British Consul at Brunei undertook a memorable journey up the Limbang River, of which he gives a graphic account in his fascinating book, \"Life in the Forests of the Far East.\" Of this journey Posewitz, who made an exhaustive study of the journeys accomplished by travellers in Borneo, writes that Sir Spenser St. John \"was the first European to follow the course of the River Limbang, and its tributary, the river Madihit, deep into the interior of the island\u2014namely, as far as the border mountains of Brunei.\" St. John left Brunei on August 25, 1858, and after fifteen days' boat journey reached the entrance of the Madihit River. Following this river up for some way he struck eastwards across country and then leaving Batu Lawi some 2 days' journey to the south-east he turned north again to the Adang villages, the main object of his expedition. After spending some time exploring this district he returned, partly down the Limbang River, which in this part is extremely dangerous on account of the rapids, and after many thrilling experiences and severe privations, he eventually reached the Madihit again on Oct. 16th, having made a 5 weeks' circular tour of that region. He reached Brunei again after an absence of 56 days. As frequent references to this account are made in the following pages for comparison with my own experiences, I need not give further details of his expedition here, beyond mentioning that he left a careful map\u2014the only reliable one of this region\u2014which I found most useful and accurate, besides being a continual source of wonder to my native followers, who could never understand how that curious piece of paper could give me the wonderful knowledge of the lay of the land which I appeared to possess!\n\n---\n\n1. *Borneo: its Geology and Mineral Resources*, by Dr. Theodore Posewitz, translated from the German by Frederick H. Hatch. 1892. p. 58.\n\n2. Should be the River Madihit.\nAfter Sir Spenser St. John's visit there appear to have been no further lengthy excursions by Europeans up the Limbang River until the occupation of that district by the Sarawak Government. This took place in 1890 and in the *Sarawak Gazette* for November 1895 (p. 207), there is a brief account of Mr. O. F. Ricketts' first visit to the Kuala Madihit and Adang country. He left Limbang station on August 24th, and arrived at Kuala Adang on September 4th, the last three days of the journey having been accomplished on foot. After staying for three days at a native house some little distance up the Adang River, he returned again down the Limbang River, arrived at the Government station on September 10th, after an absence of just three weeks. He remarks on the peaceable nature of the Adangs, but gives little further information about them or their district.\n\nMr. W. F. de V. Skrine, Assistant Resident at Limbang, made an exactly similar trip to this village in March 1911, being away 25 days.\n\nThe Limbang Reports which appear regularly in the *Sarawak Gazette* mention no other visits to the Adang country; mention however is made of Mr. Ward, then Assistant Resident at Limbang, visiting the natives in the Madihit River in 1907. He was away just 3 weeks. Thus it will be seen that during the last 20 years only three Europeans have succeeded in reaching the Kuala Madihit, which is itself the real starting place for the more arduous journeys into the interior. It should be noted however that on several occasions would-be visitors to this region have had to turn back on account of the river suddenly rising and becoming impassable for weeks at a time. It is only during certain months of the year that this up-river journey can be made, and even then, unless one has limitless time and patience it can only be accomplished with the assistance of a good deal of luck; if the down-coming torrent of water is too swift, the boats cannot get up against it; and as sometimes happens, if the river is too dry the task of dragging the boats up the rapids becomes stupendous and the traveller's progress painfully slow.\n\nTwo other routes to this elevated region present themselves to the Sarawak traveller; one up the Trusan River, which flows out into Brunei Bay a few miles east of the Limbang River; the headwaters of this river run very near the Adang stream (an upper branch of the Limbang River), but with this river too the same difficulties are present, although I am informed by natives that one has a better chance of getting up it in the right season than up the Limbang River. The other route is up the Baram and Tutau rivers, which would lead one up to the western side of the plain.\n\nTwo long trips have been made up the Trusan River, the first in 1889 by M. O. F. Ricketts accompanied by Dr. G. D. Haviland (afterwards Curator of the Sarawak Museum). An extract from\n\n---\n\n1. Resident of Trusan 1885-1890, of Limbang 1890-1909.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 63, 1912.\ntheir official diary is given in the Sarawak Gazette (1889. p. 73) from which we learn that the expedition started from Trusan Fort on March 25th, 1888, reached the Bah country in ten days and returned again by April 17th, after an absence of 24 days. The elevation of the valley (of the Bah Country) is given as \u201c3,500 ft. and the whole of it is highly cultivated and systematically irrigated;\u201d and again, \u201cAt the head of the Bah valley is the range of hills from which springs the Trusan, which at their foot is but a small trickling stream about two feet wide. This was the farthest point reached.\u201d\n\nNo mention is made of Batu Lawi, which, if seen, would surely have occasioned remark.\n\nA second expedition was made up the Trusan to this part as far as the Kelalan stream in 1910 by Mr. J. Stansfield,* who was prospecting for the Government. He was away 28 days and told me he saw no signs of Batu Lawi.\n\nThe third route,\u2014via the Baram and Tutau\u2014is the easiest, as far as the river journey is concerned; and the longest and most extensive journey, after that of St. John, has been accomplished from this side by Mr. R. S. Douglas, who reached the Bah plain, south of the Limbang and Trusan head-waters in 1908. He left Claudetown (the Government station on the Baram River) on October 25th and did not return till December 19th. He describes his journey briefly in the Sarawak Gazette (1909, p. 29) and at greater length in the Sarawak Museum Journal (1912, Vol. I, No. 2, pp. 17-29). From these it appears that he spent some time on the southern portion of the plain, but did not penetrate to its eastern or northern boundaries. The details of his sketch-map and of mine, which accompanies this paper, are necessarily imperfect, and there are certain differences which we are unable to reconcile at present; however, it is proposed to undertake a joint expedition in the near future to this region, when we hope these points will be cleared up satisfactorily.\n\nIn order to complete our historical account I have quoted below all the passages I can find in which mention is made of Batu Lawi.*\n\n*Vide Sarawak Gazette, 1910, p 68,\n\n*Sir Spenser St. John. Life in the Forests of the Far East, 2nd Ed. 1863, Vol. II, p. 25. \u201cOne of the greatest curiosities, the natives say, is the formation of two mountains, which rise from a plain in lofty peaks of the shape of needles; they have never been to them, but have seen them from a distance; they are the pillars of the gate of some enchanted palace, and I heard it whispered to one of my men that all were not privileged to see even these pillars, as it requires some incantation; so that there is a chance of the needle mountains vanishing into thin air\u201d. (Almost certainly a reference to the double peak of Batu Lawi). J.C.M.\n\nIbid. p. 87. \u201cAn hour\u2019s walk brought us to the Upper Limbang, whose bed is here, perhaps, seventy yards wide, very shallow, not reaching to the hip. It flows from the Silingid mountains, and is said, after skirting their western face, to turn to the south-east to its sources in Lawi\u201d. (The Limbang River passes Batu Lawi and is said to rise in Mt. Murud). J.C.M.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nIbid. p. 109 \"and I may yet get a look at Lawi. I have constantly borne in mind the whisper I overheard, that only certain privileged individuals are allowed to get a sight of this famous hill.\"\n\nIbid. pp. 117, 118. \"About 11 p.m. started in a south-west direction for about a mile and a half, to the top of a hill, from whence there is usually a view of Lawi, in a south-west direction; all the mountains, however, are hidden in clouds, but it must be a high one if remarkable among its towering neighbours. The whole appearance of the country is mountainous, each range becoming more lofty as we approach the hidden interior. From the elevation of about 4,348 feet, the two mountains next us looked very high, perhaps between 7,000 and 8,000 feet: they say these are the children, Lawi the father.\"\n\nWere the people not so busy with their farms, and I so pressed for time, I would try and reach Lawi, as there are people residing at its foot; but I must put it off till next expedition, when I hope to pass the mountain.\"\n\nIbid. p. 121. Again Lawi was so covered with clouds that nothing but its base could be seen; it appeared about fifteen miles off in a S.W. direction. I hear that the Limbang rises in that mountain. There are villages at its base, two of which were lately attacked by the Kayans and destroyed.\n\nA. R. Wallace. Australasia, 4th Ed. 1884, p. 348. \"Further north however, to the south-east of Brunei, are many mountains believed to be from 7000 to 8000 feet, and one, Lawi, said to be much higher, and to form the culminating point of this district.\"\n\nIbid. p. 349. \"The latter river (the Limbang) was explored by Mr. St. John in 1858 nearly to its sources in mountains between 5000 and 6000 feet high, and about 10 miles north of the lofty Lawi mountain, which he was unable to reach.\"\n\nR. S. Douglas.

The view from the summit was quite indescribable in its beauty. On the west side we overlooked the Tutau river as far away as Mount Mulu, and away northwards, across the Limbang River to Batu Lawi. On the east side the view was finer still, as it overlooked the whole of that much talked of central plain, which comprises the Bah and Mein country, and is bounded by the ranges of Pamabo, Murud and Apo Rawat on three sides and Baram river on the South-East.\"\n\nW.

Soc., No. 63 1912.\nMay 2nd, 1911. Embarking in Kuching, the capital of Sarawak, on the S. S. \"Gladys,\" one of the company's coasting-steamers, and somehow getting Dayak collectors, boy and stacks of baggage on board just in time, we left the wharf punctually at 7 a.m. and, steaming down river, reached the sea a little before 10 a.m. Inquired anxiously of the Dayaks as to the nature of last night's all-important dreams and was relieved to hear that they were all right, no bad ones. A Dayak always pays great attention to any dream that he has on the night before starting on any expedition, regarding such as a guarantee for the success or failure of his mission. When on their own, if the dreams are bad nothing will induce them to start, but when following the un-believing European they allow their fore-bodings to take second place, and when disaster comes, content themselves with a reproving \"I told you so.\" In March 1910 I set out from Kuching with the intention of doing this same expedition, but bad dreams pursued our party for the first three days and the expedition ended of course in dismal failure and illness.\n\nMay 3rd. The sea pleasantly calm all yesterday and we anchor off Kedurong point at 10.30 this morning to drop mails and a few passengers; arrive midnight at Miri, where the Anglo-Saxon Oil company have just opened a new oil-field.\n\nMay 5th. Reach Brooketon early in the morning and after a few hours there steam across Brunei Bay and into the mouth of the Limbang River, which, considering the length of the river, is remarkably narrow, and, like practically all Sarawak rivers, has a difficult bar which can only be negotiated by steamers of shallow draught and even then at not less than half-tide. However, we are over the bar and for good or bad we are started on our long river journey which is to take us a hard month's travelling through strange countries and among strange peoples before reaching the upper waters of this river and even then to fall far short of its actual sources, unknown to white men and but vaguely determined by the natives sparsely scattered along its banks. We arrive at the Government station of Limbang (or Pangkalan T\u00e9rap, as it is known by the natives) at midday and disembark, the preliminary stage of the journey done. Heavy rain all night, registering 3.92 inches next morning. This looks bad for a start, as, if anything like that amount fell up-river, it will mean a heavy fresh and make progress against it very slow or perhaps impossible for a day or two.\n\nMay 6th. Mr. \u00c9rmen, the Acting Resident of the station, kindly makes the necessary arrangements for boats, coolies, food, etc., and informs me that he has called twelve Sea-Dayaks from the Pandaruan River to assist me in the up-river journey. These and their friends came up to the bungalow in the evening and try to persuade us to let them all go. They refuse to believe in the peaceful nature of my mission and being firmly convinced that it\nis really an expedition undertaken against the tribes on the border, against whom they have (or pretend they have) old scores to pay off, they are immensely keen to accompany me. However as I know the Muruts further up-river and have arranged with them to take me through the more difficult part of the journey, we stick to our original twelve. The bazaar is full of these Dayaks who have come down to meet the Rajah and ask his permission to go on the war-path against these people in the interior, a request which was of course refused when the Rajah arrived on his annual visit a day or two afterwards.\n\nMay 7th. Leave Limbang on the Government steamer \"Alice Lorraine\" at 9 a.m. having got rid of superfluous Dayaks who had boarded the steamer in the hopes of being allowed to come at the last moment. Two were allowed to come in place of two others who asked to be let off, one on account of bad dreams and the other for domestic reasons. The steamer towing our up-river boats soon passed the first corner and cut short our last view of Europeans and civilization. Winding through low-lying country, first past untidy but picturesque Brunei-Malay houses scattered along the banks half-hidden among large banana plantations, and among them Kadayan houses intermingled, then further up river the Malays give place to the neat Bisaya houses with buffalo herds grazing near by, presenting such a peaceful scene that it is difficult to imagine all this country in the throes of continual strife under Brunei oppression only 20 years ago. Crocodiles abound in this river and I had a shot or two from the steamer at them, but without visible effect. This is the common species *C. porosus*; the Gavial (*Tomistoma schlegelii*)\u2014common enough in the Sadong River, Sarawak\u2014does not I believe occur there though it has been recorded in the neighbouring rivers of Trusan and Lawas. We arrive at Bidang at 1 p.m. and take all the baggage up to an empty house on the bank, where we arrange to pass the night. The steamer has to return as there are rocks in the river just above this and she cannot venture further. Went out with a gun in the evening and secured a pigeon (punei) and a love-bird (tiong); on returning in the boat we were startled by the firing of a small cannon twice quite near us; this came from a Bisaya house and we learned that an old lady of high rank had died that day. The head of the house asked me up and I found a few men sitting and beating gongs round the corpse,\u2014already swathed in burial clothes. There were no apparent signs of grief among the inmates of the house and I gathered that the deceased was very old, or, as the natives put it, \"her years were enough\" (*omor chukup*). The heavy rain of two days ago could only have been local as the river is not high.\n\nMay 8th. Left Bidang at 6.45 this morning in the boats manned by Bisayas. They seem to be very distinct from other tribes of this region and, according to some I asked, are closely related to the Tutongs of the Brunei\u2014Baram district. Certain authors have stated that they come from the Philippines, but I\ncould get no information on this point from the few older men I met. The late Dr. A. B. Meyer wrote to me that he had been able to notice a similarity between the vocabularies of the Bornean tribes Bisayas and Tagals with those of the Philippine tribes, Visayans and Tagalogs. The Bisayas are regarded with a good deal of awe by the up-river natives, and sinister stories are told of mysterious deaths of visitors to their houses, and of their great riches acquired by questionable means. They used to live in long houses like other natives of Sarawak, but now that their country is peaceful they are beginning to live separately, two or three families together, although there are still some long houses to be seen. Their houses are much better built than those of the Muruts, and a Bisaya remarked that the Muruts were \"like birds\" (saperti burong) because their houses would only last a year and then they had to move on and build another.\n\nAfter 4 hours paddling we arrive at Empasong and enter the large Bisaya house there. Found a Malay in it detained by a bad leg. He had been with a Mr. Walker* as collector on the Kinabatangan in North Borneo and I should have been glad to take him along as we were in need of another experienced collector, however, his injured leg almost prevented him from walking at all, so we went on again without him, and arrived at Ukong a little before 3 p.m. Here we found some Chinese shops on the left bank of the river and in one of them we made ourselves comfortable for the night. No Chinese traders are allowed any further up than this point and consequently the little settlement here does a thriving trade with the neighbouring Bisayas and Tabuns.\n\nWe are warned against throwing stones into the river, as that is certain to bring rain, which is equally certain to cause a dreaded \"fresh\" in the river. A Dayak complains to me of bad dreams and wishes to turn back, but I persuade him to try another three nights; if these bad dreams persist, then he may report to me again. From Ukong we get a good view of Mt. Buda, which is the name given to the northern spur of Mt. Molu, and the source of the Madalam river. Owing to a leaky boat some of the rice got wet and we had to leave three men behind to dry it for a day, while we went on next morning to arrange for further coolies.\n\nSeveral rumours were current here about the ravages said to have been committed by a party of Dayaks two months before among the Adangs up-river, and opinions were divided as to how the aggrieved Adangs were likely to receive us. Some suggested sending up messengers to explain the peaceful nature of our mission, but the uncertain state of the river was the only argument that weighed with me and I determined to get to the Kuala Madihit without any unnecessary delay; once there we should know more about the truth of these rumours and could act accordingly.\n\n*Author of \"Wanderings among South Sea Savages,\" 1909.\nWhile on the subject of hostile natives it may be as well to explain here the attitude which the different tribes up-river were expected to adopt towards us, and of course this subject had to be carefully considered throughout the journey. After the lower reaches of the Limbang has been passed, the population diminishes and houses become less frequent until one reaches the mouth of the Madalam River, where there are a few Murut houses, followed by a blank stretch of rapids, which occupied us 4 days in passing; at the end of this stretch the river branches sharply off to the East and becomes impassable for boats; this part is occupied by Kalabits who had recently lost their chief and were now under the leadership of his son, quite a young man. According to rumour these people were not likely to be over friendly, as they had suffered recently at the hands of Dayaks, but beyond a cool welcome nothing was feared from them. From their place (Kuala Madihit) two routes to Batu Lawi were available, one due East to the aggrieved Adangs and thence south to Batu Lawi, the other to follow the Madihit to its sources and thence due East to the mountain. The disadvantages of the latter route was the difficulty of getting coolies in this sparsely populated district, but eventually this outweighed the serious objection offered by the other route, namely, the unfriendly reception expected from the Adangs. East of Batu Lawi lived the Pa Bawans who had but recently submitted to the Government but had not yet paid tax; south of them, and south-east of Batu Lawi, the country was occupied by the powerful Pa Brian tribe who were avowedly hostile to the Government and to any tribes living under the Sarawak flag. This was the substance of the information to be obtained from the natives on the way up the river, and as the journey advanced we found that the account was accurate in the main.\n\nMay 9th: (Temp. 6 a.m. 74.5\u00b0). Leaving Ukong at 7 a.m., five hours' paddling brings us to the mouth of a little stream called the Seradan and we pull up on a high sand-bank just opposite. Above this is a small Tabun house occupied by Tama Belulok, the chief of the Tabuns of this district and one of the most influential natives on the upper part of the river. His son (Belulok) had been with\n\n1. Evidence of the warlike nature of these Pa Brian people is shown in the report for August 1911 by the Resident in charge of Trusan. He writes (Sarawak Gazette 1911, p. 198):\u2014 \"The Bah Muruts reported that the Muruts of Pa Brian came down on them while they were at work in their clearings and shot at them, killing three men. This occurred in June and was only reported on my arrival in the Trusan. Later, on the 24th, a number of Bah Muruts, including the chiefs Dawat Sigar, Gaeng Abai and Sakai Libat, with a large following came to Trusan and reported that two more of their number had been shot by Pa Brian people in the same way and their heads taken. They could make no resistance as they were outnumbered by two to one. The Bahs say they have done nothing to justify such attacks and that the Pa Briens are a terror to the Upper Trusan.\"\n\nThis must have been going on within a short distance of Batu Lawi, possibly only a few days after we left the mountain.\n\nR. A., Soc., No. 63, 1912.\nme before and this time I intended taking both father and son to see me through the journey. According to them the Tabuns come of a Treng stock and they used to occupy the country at the head waters of the Tutau and Madibit but a series of disastrous wars and diseases of various kinds sadly reduced their numbers, so that but very few representatives of this once powerful race now remain. The Tabuns occupy about three houses on the Limbang River and perhaps numbered in all some 100 souls; they are nearly related to the Muruts and Kalabits and speak both these languages easily, though the Tabun dialect itself is distinct. Closely related to the Tabuns, and in fact from the same Treng stock, are the Long Patas who live in a long house on the Tutau River under Oyau Blawing (or Tama Saging, the father of Saging, as he is now known). These two branches now form the sole survivors in Sarawak territory of the once populous Trengs.\n\nSoon after we landed below the Beluloks' house, a long boat swept round the corner and drew up beside ours, and we were soon busy shaking hands with some old friends from up-river whom we met last year. These were some 20 Tabuns and Dayaks from the Kuala Madalam on their way down river to pay their respects to the Rajah at Limbang. However I had to explain to them that His Highness had arrived at Limbang and left again already, so they turned back, while we stayed to make arrangements for coolies. In the afternoon three of us paddled a little way up the Seradan to look for a Dayak who, we were told, was working gutta there; I had arranged with him last year to accompany me in my next expedition. We eventually found his \"lancho\" or hut by the side of the stream, a few fowls outside and some lumps of rubber, and the barking of dogs told us he was not far off. Eventually we began to realize that there was some meaning to the continued barking and we were startled at hearing some animal rush through the jungle quite close; we tore off after it in the direction of the sound of cracking branches and then lost the \"scent,\" but another Dayak joined us almost immediately and said he had just caught sight of a pig swimming the river with the dogs in close pursuit; but they eventually lost it, although later in the evening our Dayak friend and his trusty dogs succeeded in bagging a \"rusa\" (deer).\n\nThe scenery up the little Seradan stream was typical, to my mind, of the best kind to be seen in Sarawak. Where a view over any large extent of country only consists of one unbroken panorama of uniform dull coloured jungle, one has to fall back upon small patches of country for the most pleasing scenic effects, and these are par excellence to be found up such jungle-shaded streams as this; dense unfathomable jungle, suggesting an infinity of forest, wall one in on each side, huge trees towering above with branches\n\n---\n\n1. For an interesting account of the custom of changing names among these tribes see \"A comparative Vocabulary of the Kayan, Kenyah & Kalabit languages\" by R.S.Douglas in the Sarawak Museum Journal No. I, 1911, p. 79.\nthrown across and interlacing foliage; through this filters the strong tropical sun, lighting up a glistening patch here and there in the winding stream beneath. Along this stream, as we enter, an occasional crocodile (three I counted) splashes clumsily into the water from off the muddy bank where he has been lying in wait for a chance meal; a little further on a \"biawak\" (Monitor lizard) walks stealthily up the bank hoping to escape notice. The stream becomes too small for our boat and we get out and walk over the rough stony bed; just at the bend ahead of us a pheasant (an Argus by the length of its tail) flutters across the stream and disappears up the opposite bank; I am too occupied with slippery boulders to get my gun up in time. Overhead we caught a glimpse of two or three \"tajak\" (Solid-casqued Hornbill, *Rhinoplax vigil*), usually out of range and jeering at us with their curious mocking cries. The lovely velvety black and green *brookeanus* (\u2642) butterfly dances by at a good pace and soon after we see another beautiful green Papilio, known locally as the \"Sarawak Beauty\" (*Papilio arjuna carnatus*); a frail black-spotted *Hestia* floats lazily by out of reach of the net, and then ensues an exciting chase after the rich green dragonfly *Neurobasis chinensis*, which, in Sarawak, is only found in the upper reaches of rivers. On returning to Belulok's house we find the same species of tiger-beetle (*Cicindela funerea*) swarming on the sand-bank at the water's edge, which I found in the same place last year; curiously enough I never could find it on any other similar locality above or below this spot on the Limbang River, nor indeed anywhere else in Sarawak. Last year another Cicindela (*C. crespignyi*) was found abundantly on the same spot, and in many places most of the way up the river, but on this occasion it was entirely absent on that sand-bank and only sparsely taken at different places further up.\n\nHeavy rain for the rest of that day, but apparently only local as it did not prevent us continuing next morning.\n\nMay 10th.: (Temp. at 9 a.m. 82\u00b0). Having arranged with Tama Belulok to collect in some of his men and to follow with Gesang, the Dayak, next day or if possible that afternoon, we leave his house in the morning and soon come to our first rapids, in this case \"wood-rapids,\" i.e. rapids formed by a mass of timber stuck in the bed of the river and sufficient to partially choke the stream. Going is rather slow against the strong stream, and it takes us till 2 p.m. to arrive at the kuala Madalam. Our friends of yesterday meet us here and we are taken up into Tama Seluling's house to spend the night. Tama Seluling himself is a very short ugly little Tabun, who seemed to spend most of his time nursing his little son or else out with a \"jala\" (casting net) after fish. The first time I went there (last year), he insisted on giving up his bed for my use, and I didn't like to refuse to use it, although the nights spent thereon were not all pleasure! The river divides here, one branch really the main Limbang River, goes off to the South-East, the other is called the Madalam River and rises in Mount Molu. On my\narrival here last year, the Limbang was in heavy flood and as it seemed hopeless trying to paddle up against it for some days, I took the opportunity of an excursion up the Madalam to its source. It took us the best part of 4 days to get there* and just 12 hours for the return journey. The route has been traversed often enough by Europeans and natives, as it is one of the recognised routes between the Limbang and Baram districts. Sir Spenser St. John gave a good account of it 50 years ago, describing how the Madalam disappears under a great rock (the Batu Tarikan) and how the Kayans had dug a ditch round this rock to get their boats through to join the stream where it emerges again the other side; this ditch is still used to-day, though not by armies of head-hunting Kayans so much as by parties of gutta-hunting natives of various tribes. We found a small party of seven Dayaks encamped there, on their way to the coast after six months' gutta-hunting. They said they had about 4 pikuls (gutta rian) for which they expected to get $120 per pikul from the Chinese at the Baram bazaar, the latest price in Kuching being about $300; this last I told them, but they seemed to look upon it as a recognized thing for the Chinaman to gather in somewhat more than a moderate profit, and indeed they seemed well satisfied with their prospective gain of some $70 each. They had been delayed there some 3 or 4 days doing nothing because their \"angei\" or omens, had been bad; they had heard the cry of an evil bird each morning and that had prevented them walking some 3 hours to the next stream where their boats awaited them. However they got over the difficulty while I was there by getting up before daylight and slipping off by torchlight before that wretched bird of ill-omen had time to wake up and utter his warning cry.\n\nA little way above the Batu Tarikan, (the rock mentioned before) the stream enters a high limestone cliff and disappears altogether into the bowels of Mt. Molu; a wide archway, but very low, only 4 ft. above the water's edge at the highest point, lets one into a spacious hall; four of us paddled in, leaving one man outside with a cut stick and a whistle, so that he could let us know if the water was rising. According to the natives the water has a way of rising very suddenly for no apparent cause, and for that reason most natives are afraid of going in there; however one must not believe them too implicitly, as in Sarawak, at any rate, they are usually most accommodating to the European traveller; if they see he wants to do something never done by white men before, they are quite ready to tell you the story of one who never dared to do this before, and at the same time keep quiet about the hundred and one who have done it. Once inside this kind of hall or ante-room a small dark door-way barely five foot square shows us the only way into mysteries of the interior; through this we push our boat, shoving against the slimy walls of the cavern with our hands. This soon\n\n*Sir Spenser St. John did the trip twice, taking 8 days on the first occasion from Brunei and 5 days on the second from the Kuala Madalam.\nwidens and the roof stretches high up over our heads; we follow a winding passage to the left for perhaps a quarter of a mile and then ground on a sand-bank and have to wander on foot round fantastic limestone rocks under huge stalactites hanging from lofty chambers, then squeeze through another passage and out again into another huge chamber, having lost the source of the stream under one of the walls. We find one of these passages leads out on to the upper surface of the cliff, thus affording an escape if the water did happen to rise and cut off our egress below. A few edible nests of the Swift (Collocalia lowi) were found, but little else besides the usual legion of bats. In all we spent an interesting hour and a quarter under the mountain,\u2014\u201cwhere no white men and but few natives had ever ventured before!\u201d\n\nI have digressed on to my trip of last year, but as the present expedition is merely a second attempt at the objective of the first, I must make that my excuse for mentioning one or two incidents of the first attempt.\n\nMay 11th: (Temp. 7 a.m. 73\u00b0). Just at the kuala Madalam there is a Tabun graveyard in the jungle by the side of the river. I landed one morning to inspect it and found the decapitated trunks of three large trees, about fifteen feet high. A space had been cut out of the top so as to hold a large jar in which the bones of the dead were deposited. One of these jars was blue and white, the other two the usual brown earthenware, but according to the Dayaks with me, none were of much value. At the foot of one of these pillars was an ordinary wooden coffin supported on two forked posts some four or five feet from the ground. This contained the remains of a Tabun who had died some six months ago and near it was another coffin of which the lid had rotted away exposing some decomposing remains. On the hill above were some Dayak graves characterised by the neatly carved \u201csarcophagus\u201d of wood marking the spot.\n\nFrom Tama Seluling\u2019s house we could see three peaks to the south of us, which were pointed out as Mt. Molu to the west, Mt. Buda (the source of the Madalam) in the centre, double peaked, and Mt. Obong to the east.\n\nTama Belulok and some Tabuns turned up this afternoon but unaccompanied by Gesang who had excused himself (and his three companions) on account of a bad dream. Our Dayaks left behind at Ukong to dry the rice have also joined us, and other men are hard at work preparing a boat to replace a leaky one we had brought from Limbang, so we have every hope of getting on tomorrow morning. I shall be glad to do so as the kuala Madalam has unpleasant memories for me, of a tedious wait of 4 days for the river to go down, of a mosquito-bitten hour in a tree waiting for some deer to come and be shot, of the subsequent chase after a wounded one in pitch dark swamp and jungle \u201cassisted\u201d by the light of a few matches, and not least, of a delicious breakfast off the roe of\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 63, 1912,\nsome freshly killed fish, followed by the most painful seizure of vomiting, such as I never wish to experience again.\n\nTama Belulok apologizes for Gesang's non-appearance and remarks somewhat scornfully that he doesn't believe in dreams and then immediately after announces cheerily that the omens were excellent this morning, and there is no doubt that we shall get to Batu Lawi all right. I went after pigeon in the evening in some secondary growth not far from the house, but could only bag two small \"kukor\" (doves, *Spilopelia tigrina*, Temm.). In the evening get some amusement out of a few parlour-tricks and trials of strength; one \"event\" consisted of laying a pole end on against the dividing wall of a house, then standing 2 feet away from the end, they pick the end up, place it on the shoulder and try to drag it away from the wall. They did it generally after a little struggle and tried from a distance of three feet but that proved too difficult. I initiated them into the mysteries of \"Indian wrestling\" which (as far as I know it) consisted in the two combatants lying down along-side one another, the head of one by the feet of the other, then with arms locked, each has to raise the leg nearest his adversary and with a skilful lock and adjustment of his weight, try to overthrow the other. They took to it kindly and a succession of contests helped to pass a pleasant evening, enlivened with a little gin, beating of gongs and Dayak dancing.\n\nMay 12th: (Temp. 8 a.m. 77\u00b0). The river still all right, our crews out early this morning getting the baggage stored in the boats. After some delay we start, 15 in one boat and 13 in the other; two birds \"engkrasak\" (Spider-hunters, *Archnothera*, sp.) fly across our bows from right to left; these are regarded as a very good omen and are hastily greeted by each Tabun with some such phrase as this, shouted out in a great hurry so that it may reach the birds before they are out of ear-shot:\n\n\"Kabing kong ai meching yang Batu Lawi. Naam aid,\" which meant, as far as I could gather\u2014\"O birds, see us safe to Batu Lawi, and let no sickness befall us.\"\n\nWe saw or heard other birds of good omen and everyone was in great spirits, paddling along with light hearts and (more important) with vigorous arms. What I read as good omens were:\u2014(i) the appearance of the well-known leaf butterfly (*Kallima inachis buxtoni*), which I saw alight on the trunk of a tree*; it is not uncommon in the Limbang district but rarely met with in other parts of Sarawak; (ii) the rare brown Papilio, *P. payeni brunei*, which flew over our heads soon after starting, and (iii) the capture of a fine male *Amblypodia narada* feeding on animal excrement.\n\n---\n\n*Vide Wallace's \"Malay Archipelago,\" where he records the leaf butter, fly always settling on twigs. I have only once seen the species alight on a twig, but three times on the trunks of large trees. C.J.Brooks in Journ. Str. Br.-Roy. Asiat. Soc. No. 60,1911. p. 42, makes a similar observation having captured one on the trunk of a tree and another on a leaf.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\non a sunny gravel bed in mid-stream; this is also a rare species in Sarawak. A little before mid-day we arrived at a long Murut house, where we stopped for a meal. The head of the house, one Klowat, wanted us to stay the night, as they were celebrating the marriage of one of the ladies of the house with a Dayak. Such marriages are by no means infrequent; a party of wandering Sea-Dayaks go off for several months after gutta and very often finding desirable maidens, two or three of them marry and settle down in their adopted country. Our boats' crew were all in favour of the project and tried hard to persuade me to accept Klowat's invitation, this was the last house we should see before reaching the kuala Madihit, at least some three or four days' journey ahead of us, so the occasion for a convivial evening seemed too tempting to be missed. However I was determined to take every advantage of the present low state of the river and push on as far as possible, knowing from bitter experience last year the difficulties caused by the least fresh; so after an hour's patient and good-tempered argument we started off again, our crew further increased by two more Muruts from this house.\n\nThis was the third house we had stopped at on the way since leaving Ukong, and each of these three houses had been built since my visit to them last year. In 1910 Tama Belulok's house was a small tumble-down little shanty ill-becoming an important chief, and he was then meditating building a decent house; this year I found him in the same kind of house built a few yards from the site of that of last year, and again he was talking of building one of larger size and more lasting material. Tama Seluling's house had also been rebuilt within a few yards of last year's but his new one was a decided improvement on the old one and should perhaps last three years. Klowat's house had also been rebuilt, but this time a little further up the river. Last year I spent four days in his old house waiting for the river to go down, and consequently got to know something about that class of house. Like all native houses in Sarawak it was raised on wooden piles some eight feet off the ground on the high bank of the river, but out of reach of all but the biggest floods. A notched trunk led up from the water's edge over the slippery bank and another leaning against the end of the house gave access on to a rough platform. The house was divided down the middle by a wooden partition, which shut off the living rooms of each family on the left, leaving the whole of the right side open as one long common room. The leaf attap roof, highest along this centre line slopes down to within some 4 feet of the floor on each side, the space thus left was filled in with rough boards or in some places simply with split bamboo, leaving a long slit of perhaps a foot in width, running the length of the house through which one could look out. In the common verandah everybody used to gather, only dispersing into the living rooms for meals and at night to sleep; though visitors always sleep (and sometimes have their meals) in this verandah. Unlike Sea-Dayak houses there\nwas no outer platform running the length of the house for drying paddy, as the Muruts dry theirs on the farms, but only the small one at the end, which appeared to serve no particular purpose. The side devoted to the living rooms was partitioned off unequally into five compartments, one for each family; each compartment being provided with a door and a fireplace; the dividing partitions were for the most part low and by standing up one could see pretty well from one end of the house to the other. The accompanying diagram gives an idea of the \"ground-floor\" plan.\n\nAs a distinguished visitor I was accommodated during those four days with a corner in one of these rooms, the other occupants being three middle-aged Muruts laides, very dirty and ugly and two small children. The woman appeared to possess but one garment each, which they never changed during the whole time I was there. My diary of April 4th, 1910, has the following note recorded in that house:\n\n(Murut)\n\ni, ii, iii, living rooms (terkap.)\n\n(1)\u2014(5), fire-places for cooking (tal) fitted with wooden rack (dran) for drying fire-wood.\n\n6, 7, 8, fire-places.\n\nM, door (tingga) into living-room from common verandah.\n\nN\u2014N, dividing wall of boards, bark or split rotan, (pipi).\n\nS,T,V, Common room (sikang).\n\nX,Y,Z, Common passage, a step lower than the common room (S.T.V.), (naduran)\n\nA, dividing partition (suman) between living rooms, about 4ft high, of split rotan or bark.\n\nR, platform outside.\n\nQ, steps (ichan) from platform to ground, about 8ft.\n\nP, main posts supporting floor and roof (diri).\n\nThe \"attic,\" formed by a few boards laid across the beams under the roof is called parong (Dayak sadau); The roof is called bulok; the floor, seloi; leaf attaps for roof, apor; beam supporting the rafters, ptian; tie-beam supporting the floor, barat; rest for cooking-pot, ungan; cooking-pot, badong; mit, ugum.\n\nHeight of floor of house above ground, 8ft., of side walls to lowest part of roof, 4\u00bdft., of middle partition to top of roof ridge 8ft.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n\"The Murut ladies of the house give an exhibition of feeding; a more disgusting sight can hardly be imagined (especially when one is eating in the same room) than to see these three seated on the floor stuffing handfuls of rice into their mouths and then stoking it in with their fingers.......I was delighted to see an instance of a human being searching for bugs, etc., in the hair of another; this being performed by a little boy who thus amused himself with his mother's hair while she lay on the floor playing with her baby.\" The eating of the \"captures\" I saw later on. In spite of the somewhat low social status of these Muruts, they were very pleasant and friendly, always courteous and respectful, without any of that unpleasant cringing manner so typical of many Malays. The men always showed great interest in our guns and with one I exchanged an empty brass cartridge-case for one of his cartridge-cases; viz. a neatly carved little bamboo tube divided into two compartments, one for powder and the other for shot, with a wooden plug at each end.\n\nAfter leaving Klowat's house we made good progress except over the rapids where the men usually had to jump overboard and pull the boats up. About three o'clock clouds began to gather and we pulled up at the kuala Smarpit on the left bank and made a lancho (shelter) for the night.\n\nMay 13th: (7.30 a.m. temp. 80\u00b0). A fine morning and the river still just right. The Dayak who reported bad dreams before and wanted to return for that reason, comes this morning with woeful tidings; he dreamt he had lost all his teeth. This is the last straw, so I allow him to go home, which means a half day's walk for him through pathless jungle to Klowat's house and there await for a chance boat to take him down to Limbang. I learnt afterwards that he always did the same thing, even when out with Dayaks alone; after a few days he would feel homesick, plead bad dreams and return! We leave soon after 7 a.m. and spend the whole day poling and dragging the boats up the rapids. Pass the Sertab rapid in safety; this has a bad reputation and is supposed to be very dangerous when there is a lot of water in the river; in its present condition however we have nothing to fear. Passing through sandstone we come to a limestone patch and enter the long wide reach that ends at the Kuala Saladong, late in the afternoon in torrents of rain. We find remains of some recently used lanchos, which are soon enlarged and made habitable with our kadjang coverings, and a bottle of gin to the crews helps to keep the cold out. Luckily the rain stops about 8 p.m. and the general opinion is that it is only local rain, so that it should not seriously affect the state of the river. I feel rather nervous about it, remembering a six days sojourn in this very place last year waiting for the river to subside, nor have I forgotten an attempt to advance against the flood resulting in one boat being swamped and the greater part of our baggage nicely moistened. Tama Belulok tells me how the Kalabits from the interior come down and buy buffaloes from the\nBruneis and Bisayas to take back with them. A small jungle track was pointed out to me as the road they used, and the journey, he told me, took them anything up to two months up and down a series of very steep hills; many buffaloes die on the journey, but they expect to get more than half through to the end. Tama Belulok says they start back with about 50, which they buy for about $35 each (adults) down to perhaps $15 for a young one. Kalabits always kill one at any important feast.\n\nI note the charms hanging from Tama Belulok\u2019s belt; a small broken cowrie shell, a small piece of brass, an inch of cane, a human finger-nail (convincing proof of cannibalism!), a pair of brass depilatory forceps and a small reddish dried fruit.\n\nDuring our conversation the word \u201ck\u2019lit\u201d occurs, mentioned by one of the Tabuns, who doesn\u2019t know the Malay for it, and I cannot make out for some time what he means. Tama Belulok explains it thus: \u201ca bird that has no feathers\u201d and Madu, my Land-Dayak boy, guesses it at once and explains it as \u201chaving wings like a paper umbrella,\u201d so that at last it dawns on me that \u201ck\u2019lit\u201d is the Tabun for \u201cbat.\u201d\n\nWe saw two pigs on the bank, but no time to get a gun out before they had fled. It was near here last year that we came across a dead pig floating down stream; the natives with me at once brought it ashore and on examination found that it had been freshly killed, probably by a crocodile, and within an hour the whole lot of them were squatting round fires on the boulders by the river\u2019s edge, enjoying a feast of roast pork.\n\nThe little Saladong stream flows out just below our camping-place skirting a high white limestone cliff, which gives the alternative name of \u2018Salindong\u2019 to this place. One day during our enforced wait at this place last year five of my Dayaks spotted a particular grass growing on the top of this cliff; as they could only see one or two little tufts of this, they sneaked off by themselves taking great care not to be seen by the other natives of the expedition, and after a most strenuous (and rather dangerous) scramble they succeeded in gathering a clump of this coveted grass (\u201cbuloh berindu\u201d), which they carefully divided, each becoming the proud possessor of a few blades. My most persistent questions failed to elicit any information as to their use for it, the more I asked the more amused and secretive they became, and all I could get out of them was that it was not used as medicine for sickness nor as an ointment for wounds. And it was only some months after that I was told that it had the mysterious power of ensuring success in courtship to its possessor. My diary of that date (April 10th) last year has the following note which may help to illustrate the Dayaks\u2019 methods:\u2014\u201cKetit (Sea-Dayak) sells his coat to one of the Muruts of the party for $1, which he asks me to take out of the Murut\u2019s wages for him later. Ketit tells me he bought it second-hand for 60 cents in Kuching, but that he told the Murut he\ngave $1.50 for it! Hugely pleased with himself over his transaction.\"\n\nWhile encamped there I ascended the hill just above the mouth of the Saladong and from an altitude of 770 ft. got a view of Mt. Obong bearing S. S. W. It did not look very far off\u2014the natives said three days, and I should have guessed it to be but 3-4000 feet in height. E. S. E. of us we saw a long range called Pagun ending in a high peak due S. E. They told me rhinoceroses were to be found there; also that the streams Madamit and Saladong rise there. The Trusan river lies East of this range. On another day I went to visit an old burial ground just above the kuala Saladong. About an hour's walk (unnecessarily long, but there was no path and the guide was a bit hazy as to the right direction) through the jungle we came to a limestone cliff; about 30 feet up this was a small cave, \"Libong Seriou,\" to which we climbed by means of tree-roots, etc.; although only a small cave of no great depth, it seemed to be the home of innumerable bats, which, with a great whir-r-ring of wings, created quite a blast of cold air. In this cave were a number of broken jars (I counted 30 to 40) in which Muruts or Tabuns had been buried. Some of the jars were said to be very old and worth from two to three hundred dollars if they had not been broken. I had one (the least broken) removed and succeeded in bringing it safely to Kuching, and it is now in the Sarawak Museum. Knowing how particular natives are about safe-guarding their burial-grounds, as of course is only natural, I was most careful to inquire if they objected to my removing the jar; they assured me that it didn't matter in the least, that nobody was buried there now and had not been within the memory of man, that these broken jars were of no use to anyone and that if I was anxious to take the remains of one, nobody could possibly object. So I took it, arriving in due course at Limbang with the jar and party safe and sound. Then followed an unpleasant 10 days of malaria before reaching Kuching at the end of April. This year I am warned against taking any more jars, as that, according to my Limbang friends, was the obvious cause of my fever and such was only to be expected as a reminder from the offended spirits!\n\nBelulok told me that it was supposed to be an old Tabun burying place, although none knew for certain now; their custom, like that of other tribes of this region, is to bury their dead temporarily in one of these big jars, then place it in a cave like Libong Seriou for some six to twelve months, during which interval the body decomposes and drains through a hole in the bottom. After this interval a great feast is held, the jar is opened, and the bones taken out and placed in a smaller jar for similar burial in some other place. According to Belulok the story goes that there used to be a house on a flat rock just in the mouth of this cave, until a landslip occurred causing the collapse of the house and the death of most of the inhabitants. The few survivors buried their\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 63, 1912.\nrelations in the cave behind and from that day it became a regular burying place.\n\nSt. John records the fresh traces of a Kayan war-party at this place (Salindong), noticed on his arrival here. A long pole ornamented with three palm-leaf tassels was interpreted by some of his party to mean that the Kayans had obtained three heads.\n\nMay 14th.: (Temp. 75\u00b0). Leave our camp about 7.30 and soon find the river running between narrower and more rocky sides. In one place it narrows quite suddenly and a large rock on each side gives the name of \"Tiger's leap\" to this part. Tama Belulok as usual sits in my boat and proves a patient conversationalist in spite of my wearying stream of questions. One thing he told me which was rather astonishing; he said that the nomad Penans have large families as a rule, averaging perhaps 6 or 7; which in consideration of their hard life was in startling contrast to the smaller families of 2 and 3 to be found among the more sedentary tribes of this region. The Penans were spoken of with disdain by the Tabuns owing to their uncleanly habits; \"you can always tell a Penan by his smell, as he never washes except in the rain!\" And this latter statement was certainly true of a few whom I picked up later on, although I did not observe the smell.\n\nAfter 4 hours paddling we pass the kuala Tuan, where I camped for three nights last year, and after an abortive attempt to proceed further against the flood had to give up my first expedition and return defeated. Half an hour later we arrived at the kuala Sipangi, the furthest point reached on that expedition and we sit down to a midday meal and discuss the troubles of getting here experienced last year. This last reach was particularly bad, as the stream was too strong to allow the men to pole against it and only the slowest progress could be made by sending on two or three with a rotan rope, and then they had the greatest difficulty in climbing along the steep rocky sides, catching hold of any shrubs or branches to save themselves falling into the river and being swept away by the raging torrent. Not counting an interval of six days in which we went up the Madalam, as the Limbang was too high to allow us to start, it took us 12 days to reach the kuala Tuan from the kuala Madalam, while this year we had accomplished the same distance in 2\u00bd days only. Natives say they are frequently held up for a month at a time, and at kuala Saladong we found a party of Dayaks, who, after a month's wait for the river, were just going down river again to obtain some more provisions. At the kuala Tuan, we found six more Dayaks, who said they had been waiting 20 days for the river to go down. Once we had decided to give it up, the return journey was very different, and a most exciting time we had shooting down the rapids at a great pace, missing certain destruction on rocks by a hair's breadth every few minutes. The Muruts are particularly clever at guiding a boat down these swift rivers and indeed they have to be, as many lives have been lost in these very places. Only last year the chief of the\nMadihit Kalabits was drowned just by the kuala Tuan owing to his boat capsizing in the rapids there. Once or twice we shipped a lot of water and only just managed to bale it out in time for the next rapid. That return journey from the kuala Tuan all the way down to the Government station at Limbang took us just 18 hours actual paddling.\n\nAt the kuala Sipangi we were much bothered by bees, which simply swarmed on the bank while we ate; luckily no one was stung, but we were glad to be off again, leaving these unwelcome visitors behind. The country becomes more open as far as we can see it and sandstone crops up again; quite a change after the narrow gorges passed through lower down. At the mouth of a little ditch called the Delong we drew up our boats for the night (3.30 p.m.) after a long day of comparatively easy going. Soon rig up a lancho among the bamboos on the right bank and go to sleep with the comforting prospect of but one day's journey between us and the kuala Madihit, where our river troubles are to end. St. John gives a vivid account of his troubles in getting up the rapids in the gorges just passed (l. c. pp. 63-65).\n\nMay 15th: (Temp. 8 a.m. 76\u00b0). A good deal of rain last night and consequent fresh in the river this morning, however we get off at 7.30 going very slow against the rising stream. Progress for the most part can only be made by seizing hold of bushes along the bank and dragging the boat along that way until one comes to a corner where the stream is too strong to allow the boat to pass, then every one seizes a paddle and letting go the bushes paddles for life across to the other side, so as to creep up some twenty yards of slack water there as far as the next bend, when the process is repeated. The dash across the current usually involves the loss of some dozen yards and this distance has to be re-paddled. The accompanying diagram illustrates the method of progress.\nDiagram showing course of boats against heavy stream.\n\nBoat's course.\nWhen the stream is very strong it is impossible to get a boat round a point like that marked A, as the moment the bow of the boat enters the stream the water rushes in and swamps the boat; one then has to make a hut on the bank and sit patiently watching the river for a month, or less, as the case may be. Again when the current is pretty strong the man have to paddle all the know in order to get across from one point to another, like those marked A and B; otherwise the boat is swept down past B to the point below, marked C; then the distance A to C has to be covered again by wearily poling and dragging at the bank as far as A, where the dash across has to be attempted again.\n\nThe Tabuns say that the island at the mouth of the Delong is the site of an ancient murut graveyard, but there is nothing to be seen there now.\n\nAt one place the river made a huge horseshoe bend which took us an hour to get round by boat, while some walked across in a couple of minutes. After some four hours poling we enter a long wide reach and meet some Kalabits removing wood to build a house; these are the first people we have met since leaving Klowat's house and we pull in alongside the bank to discuss the latest news from the front. The kuala Madihit is just ahead of us and we paddle into its shady waters at 12.30, glad to get out of the hot midday sun; we congratulate each other on the successful accomplishment of the uncertain part of the journey; the rest depends entirely on ourselves now. The Tabuns and Muruts have seen or heard good omens every day and the Dayaks have had no bad dreams, which accounts for our success so far; and as we enter the Madihit, Tama Belulok hears another good bird and our eventual arrival at Batu Lawi is now assured.\n\nAt the entrance of the Madihit, the Limbang winds away to the East and according to the natives soon becomes impassable for boats. The Madihit itself is quite a small stream, pleasantly sluggish at the mouth when we entered, but we soon come to the inevitable rapid, and after half an hour's struggling reach the landing-place of a Kalabit house. Here we are met by a dozen or so clean-limbed well-built natives, headed by Tama Kuling, the young chief of the Kalabits of this district. We climb the steep bank to his house which is built some way up in the hollow of a hill; the jungle has been felled all round and the heat is consequently great. Tama Kuling only recently succeeded his father, one Saribu, a powerful chief in his time, until he met an untimely end last year shooting the rapids at kuala Tuan. His body was recovered and they are now preparing an enormous feast to celebrate the final burial of his bones. All the countryside are invited to it, the Adangs from Okap's house three days away, the Kalabits from Seridan and Malinau; most of all the Madihit Kalabits and some down-river Muruts have already arrived. Tama Kuling shows me no less than 35 great jars of tuach (the native whisky-and-very-little-soda, made from fermented rice) awaiting consumption. An\naverage jar measures 2 ft. 9 in. in height and some 5 ft. in circumference; they hold about 23 gallons so that some 800 gallons in all were awaiting consumption! Tama Kuling wanted our party to stay for this great feast, but as they talked of being drunk for a week or more I decided against it, though by doing so it became difficult to get coolies enough to follow; our boats' crews being insufficient to carry food and baggage over the land journey. As mentioned before, from the kuala Madihit two routes to Batu Lawi offered, one to the Adang villages and then south to the mountain, the other up the Madihit and then due east for an indefinite number of days\u2014some said three, others ten. The majority of the Adang people were expected at the feast, so it was regarded as useless to expect to get coolies from their houses, besides the rumours of unpleasant feeling between them and the Dayaks with me, which we had heard down-river, were confirmed here, so we decided on the Madihit route. Tama Kuling himself naturally could not leave all his guests to accompany us, so he deputed an elderly Kalabit, Penribut by name, to take charge of us. He was the head of the furthest house up the Madihit and was said to know the way at Batu Lawi. I went up the hill behind the house in the evening (800 ft.) and enjoyed a fine view of the surrounding hills though we were not high enough up to see the lofty mountains of the interior. In the evening we all warmed up over two bottles of gin (my contribution) and one jar of tuach (from Tama Kuling). The Kalabits seemed a little apprehensive and uncertain of our intentions when we arrived, but night time saw us all on quite friendly terms. Tama Kuling expects Penribut and his men to come in to-morrow as they have been invited to the feast. We kept it up to a late hour that night and when I woke next morning some of the \"hard cases\" were still at it.\n\nMay 16th.: (Temp. in house 7.30 a.m. 74\u00b0). The collectors and I went off collecting this morning into the jungle on the hill behind the house, two with guns and others with butterfly nets. I was lucky enough to find a Lycaenid butterfly (*Allotinus nivalis*) in the act of attending an Homopterous larva. The Museum collectors had reported this phenomenon on several occasions before from different places and I communicated the substance of their observations to the Entomological Society of London,* but I had not then been able to make the observations myself. I first saw the butterfly cross my path and allight on the upperside of a twig, perhaps three feet from the ground, then it walked slowly round to the underside of this twig and approached a small whitish \"mouldy\"\u2014looking larva (Homopterous?), *on which* were standing two very small black ants apparently feeding. The butterfly, when close enough, stood there protruding its tongue gently on to the larva,\n\n---\n\n*Proc. Ent. Soc. Lond. 1910. pp. xxxviii-xli. \"A Lycaenid in attendance on an Homopteron\" and \"A further note on a Lycaenid in attendance on an Homopteron.\"*\nwhich stayed there quite passively; the ants also did not object, though occasionally one would walk in the way of the butterfly's proboscis and then one antenna would come down slowly as if in gentle remonstrance. Both antennae were held well back over the butterfly's head and the wings were closed erect, in the usual manner of this subfamily of Lycaenidae. I watched the process for some minutes, squatting quite close to the performers.\n\nIn the evening it rained, and just before dusk we were startled by the sudden arrival of a party of Adangs rushing down the hillside with parangs (swords) drawn. They rushed round the house in the pouring rain cutting down any low-growing shrub in their path and then climbed up the ladder into the house breathless; I was unable to find out the exact significance of this custom; later we go through the gin and tuach process again in honour of the new arrivals who have come in during the day and now fill the house. Instead of the usual dancing the Kalabits entertain us with a curious sing-song, which is quite pleasant to the ear with its full tones and gentle cadences, one or two singing a part together, others answering and then a loud chorus before beginning another verse. They went on most of the night and the jar of drink was still in requisition in the morning. This jar is stood in the middle of the long common-room which runs the length of the house as in Murut houses, and round it sit all the people. One (or sometimes two) appears to be in charge of it and his duty is to lead the visitor up to have a pull at the bamboo tube stuck in the lid, or else when the lid is off to bale out a cupful and take it round. There is always a great deal of fuss made before the thirsty visitor permits himself to drink, and after several good-tempered attempts to refuse it he eventually accepts, having insisted on the host taking a sip first. It is then a point of honour to drain the cup dry\u2014none too easy to task when the liquid is neat gin! The head of the Adangs, Tama Kuling, Penribut, Tama Belulok and I drank each other's health going through this same ceremony; thus Tama Kuling refused the drink I offered him till I had tasted it myself and when my turn came for one of them to offer me a drink I, being in Kalabit-land, must needs do as Kalabits do, and so was equally persistent in refusing the proffered drink until the bearer of it had tasted it himself first.\n\nThe women appeared singularly ill-favoured, though cleaner and whiter-skinned than the Muruts down-river. They wore a little collection of metal rings (tin or iron) suspended from the lobe of the ear; and their arms (wrist to shoulder) and legs (ankle to knee) were usually tattooed with some linear pattern. Their only garment was a short skirt, which some writer has rather aptly described \"as beginning too late and ending too soon.\" The men wear a long tooth (tiger-cat's or bear's) through the hole in the upper part of each ear and sometimes a brass ring or lump suspended from the lobe as well. I measured a few Kalabits in the house and found the height of adult males varied from 5 ft. 1 in.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 63, 1912.\nto 5 ft. 6 in. They spanned more than their height by some 2 inches or so in every case. A Murut, Balang Alar by name, a fine tall well-made fellow with long thick hair reaching below his waist measured 5 ft. 9 in. and seemed to tower over his neighbours.\n\nIn this house I noticed a curious pair of antlers hanging up on the wooden partition which run down the middle of the house. Unfortunately I do not know the right way of describing them and my intention of photographing them on my return was frustrated through alterations in our plans, which prevented my returning to that house again. My note-book has the following:\u2014\"four stout branches (2 on each side), these branching off again into blunt wide projections, totalling 14 points in all. Tama Kulung's father bought it from the Pabawan people years ago and according to them it belongs to a \"rusa\" (Cervus equinus), but it is so different from that, that I think it must belong to a different animal.\" I tried to purchase it, but Tama Kulung did not want to part with it. Later he gave me some rice for our men in exchange for some yards of red cloth. I also presented him with a whistle which pleased him quite a lot. He was most particular in regarding my cloth and his rice as presents, and strongly deprecated all idea of the transaction being in the nature of a purchase.\n\nTama Kulung, Balang Alar, the tall Murut, and one or two of the other Murut visitors from down-river talk Malay, but the rest cannot talk that language or Dayak. It is curious to note the effect of the enterprising Dayaks who are spreading rapidly over this and adjacent districts, for in many Murut houses the inmates talk Dayak but not Malay; one Murut I remember last year seemed almost hurt that the language I spoke (Malay) was not the same as the foreign tongue he had learnt (Dayak), \"jako Iban aku namu,\" he said, \"tapi jako nuan enda namu aku.\" (\"Dayak I know, but your linguistic efforts beat me altogether\"), so I had to try my best Dayak on him, resulting I'm afraid, in but indifferent success. The Tabuns seemed most at home in this language question, talking Malay, Dayak, Murut and Kalabit with equal ease; these two last dialects are certainly very close to Tabun but are nevertheless quite distinct, so much so that a Trusan Murut with me could hardly make himself understood at all when talking to a Kalabit and his persevering attempts used to call forth shouts of laughter from his Tabun friends. He talked Malay and Dayak to a certain extent. Two of my Dayaks knew Murut well, having married Murut ladies, but they couldn't understand any Kalabit.\n\nOur new guide Penribut (Kalabit) an oldish man with a cheerful smile and a great capacity for drink did not understand a word of Malay or Dayak, but appeared to talk Murut easily enough. St. John's journey was made by the Madihit, and although he records the traces of a former Chinese colony there, he makes no mention of any other settlers in the Madihit.*\n\n*To show how extensively the Chinese formerly spread over the country, I notice that they had pepper plantations even up the Madihit as late as the remembrance of some of the oldest Muruts.\" (l.c.p.73).\n\nJour Straits Branch\nMay 17th: A certain amount of thick heads this morning and consequently rather slow in getting away. Our plan is to get up the Madihit to Penribut's house by boat as far as possible, wait a day there for coolies and rice, and then walk overland to Batu Lawi. The eleven Pandaruan Dayaks make some trouble over the shortage of matches and even say they want to return on this account. I had foolishly trusted to some patent lighters which I thought would withstand the wet better than boxes of wooden matches and in consequence had not brought many boxes of matches. Unfortunately they also withstood our attempts at striking a light, however some of the Tabuns had brought a few packets and by taking a little care we were able to make them last out all right. There is a strong fresh in the Madihit so that we can use boats, though progress is necessarily slow against this strong stream; without the fresh the river would be too dry to allow boats to be used at all. At 3 o'clock clouds began to gather and we stop to make a lancho on the left bank. In the evening we catch a large number of moths flying to the lamp on the \"krangan\" (stony river bed) below our hut.\n\nMay 18th: (Temp. 7.45 a.m. 73.5\u00b0). Break camp early and after breakfast start off again (8 a.m.), soon encountering steep rapids. Pass the kuala Rawan on our left and later on the kuala Tera (? = that marked in St. John's map as Petra). The boats are dragged up with some difficulty and we come later to a bad place called the Seridan rapid; here Tama Belulok says he has been wrecked twice, losing most of his belongings each time. Just above this we come to the kuala Aripenou and find a small Kalabit house on the right bank. It is impossible to get the boats any further up the river and although it is only one o'clock, Penribut's house is too far off to reach to-night, so we haul the boats up and have a refreshing bathe\u2014a daily joy in the latter part of this up-river journey safe from the fear of crocodiles, although the natives say that they are seen right up these streams even as far as this, but they never attack human beings; after the bathe, a meal and then a ramble in the jungle behind the house. Some Kalabits arrive in the afternoon from Tama Kuling's house, having left early in the morning on foot, doing the journey in about 6 hours (without carrying baggage) while we have taken a day and a half to do the same distance by river. Penribut arrives later and finds me bathing at the landing place. He makes a picturesque figure fording the river in his bark war-coat ornamented with the black and white tail feathers of a hornbill hanging over his shoulders; the front of the coat (which by the way is armless) is much shorter and is ornamented by a large round pearl-shell;* a blue chawat (loin cloth), his hair twisted in a knot at the back of his head and fastened with a long iron pin (about 9 inches and about as thick as a big French nail) and a spear in his hand completes the picture. Belulok tells\n\n* See Ling Roth, vol. 2, pp. 101 and 103.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 63, 1912.\nhim to shake hands with me, apparently a novel proceeding to him, and then he joins me in my bathe, taking care to bathe below me so that I shall not get his wash!! I have been told that in certain places natives make a point of bathing in the stream below a European while he is bathing above, so that they can enjoy the water tainted by him and thus partake of some of his superior (?) qualities. The same principal is in evidence when a Malay shakes hands with a Hadji (man who has done the pilgrimage to Mecca) and draws his hands away from the Hadji into his own chest, with the idea of partaking of some of the Hadji's holiness. Malays and many other natives do it too after shaking hands with Europeans, though the actual good obtained thereby in some of these cases must be a little doubtful.\n\nWhen we arrived at this house there was hardly a soul to be seen, most of the men being away feasting at Tama Kuling's and the women were too afraid to come out of their rooms for some time. Belulok told me a message had been sent from Tanua Kuling's house the night before to advise them of our coming and to assure them of our peaceful intentions, otherwise they would all have fled into the jungle.\n\nAfter a few friendly overtures to the smaller children of the house in the shape of a biscuit or two, their shyness disappeared and the inmates began to show themselves. I found it always answered remarkably well to pay attention to the babies, as that seemed to dispel any feelings of distrust at once; the women beamed silently at one, while the men were more disposed to help. The men themselves seem to pay more attention to the children than do their mothers, for in every house one would see a proud father or two strolling about with a child on his back, no matter whether he was an important chief or not. Thus a request to the chief for the loan of a boat was certain to be acceded to without further trouble, if one adroitly oiled the way first with a sardine for the chief's baby son! Noticed a small monkey (\"brok\") Macacus nemestrinus tied up to the house, the first pet I have seen on this journey, except for countless ill-fed dogs which are the greatest nuisance in every house.\n\nMay 19th: We are still short of men to act as carriers and we have to leave some things behind, such as kadjangs and food for the return journey. We get off at 8.30, thirty-nine of us in all and a Dayak, a Chinaman and myself, the representative of Europe. The path almost at once leads down and cross the river, then up a steep bit on the left bank, past the site of a former Kalabit house visited by Mr. Ward in 1907; the posts were still remaining, but no more, the people having moved elsewhere; then up to 1,400 ft. and later to 1,700 ft., the path running along the top of a range of hills running more or less parallel to the Madihit; in one place we pass a solitary jar standing by the path; this is pointed out as containing the remains of a Kalabit, who died last year; at midday we descend to a small stream, the Gritang, where we feed. According\n\nIour. Straits Branch\nto St. John's map this stream should be on the other side of the Madihit and I learnt later that there was another stream of that name flowing out on the other bank just at the same place as the Gritang joins the Madihit from our side; and some days later we passed two streams of the same name flowing into the Madihit, one on either side.\n\nAfter the Gritang the path cuts inland away from the Madihit and we climb a range of hills further west to those which border the Madihit; between the two hills is a wide valley and perched right on the top of the hill opposite us we see Penribut's house. The path winds round to the head of the valley and so across until we arrive a little after 4 p.m. We have come practically due south from the mouth of the Madihit, the general direction of the Limbang from the kuala Madalam to that point being south-east. We stopped once or twice on the path by some curiously marked trees. A smooth strip had been cut on the trunk and some charcoal figures drawn to represent guns, buffaloes, jars and boats. Tama Belulok explained that these were records of other parties that had passed that way; some three or four circles he explained meant they had been travelling three or four months and some other marks he interpreted as the number of lumps of rubber obtained by the party! We left our mark for the information of the next passers-by.\n\nPenribut's house is built across the top of a hog's back ridge at an altitude of 2,100 ft., and consequently gets a continual gale blowing through it from one side of the valley or the other, and the smoke inside was something awful. We were met outside by a short ugly man with close-cropped hair who came down the steps of the house to do the honours in the absence of Penribut, who was following a little way behind. They told me that he had recently lost his wife and that was the reason of his shaved head, which looked very out of place among all these men with fine long hair flowing down their backs. Apparently it is the custom among the Kalabits, Muruts and Tabuns, for a man to shave his head on the death of his wife, and again when her bones are removed to their final resting place after the temporary disposal of some six months in a jar. After the final burial the widower may let his hair grow again. The same rule applies to a woman who loses her husband; she has to shave her head too. In Tama Kulung's house I noticed two people (man and woman) distinguished by this sign of bereavement. Tama Belulok tells me the custom is not observed on the death of a parent or child.\n\nWhile sitting in Penribut's house in the evening, we heard a sudden commotion going on behind the wooden partition which runs the length of the house dividing the living rooms from the common room. Instantly Penribut got up to see what was the matter and he was soon followed by about ten other Kalabits who all disappeared into one of the rooms; the noise continued and seemed to come from several babies and women screaming at once,\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 63, 1912.\nhelped by discordant cries from the men endeavouring to make them quiet. Eventually we learned that it was a baby crying\u2014\u201csakit tolach,\u201d as my people explained it, meaning that it was a fit, paroxysm of anger (?) or delight (?) brought on by our arrival. One of the Kalabits brought out a small plug of wood which they asked me to spit on; this done, they took it back, touched the child\u2019s hand and body with it, and the cure was complete; peace reigned once more and we resumed our conversation about plans for to-morrow. The Tabuns and Dayaks took it all as a matter of course and I gather that the same thing is done with them. The commotion among the Kalabits for the moment was quite remarkable.\n\nAs mentioned above, the house stands on the top of a hill and a magnificent view of the surrounding country is thus obtained. To the west, i.e., straight across the valley below us is the range of hills which we came along to-day, behind them rise Molu and Obong where the Seridan, Malinau and Tutau rivers have their source; to the south-west there are some high mountains which must be in the Baram district about the head of the Akar; in the south and to the south-east are more hills which they say border the Bar country; due East of us they point out a little rock as big as my thumb peeping over the top of a great black range of mountains on the horizon: this is Batu Lawi, the object of our journey, and we have to reach that range of mountains before we can see any more of it, let alone get to it! In spite of warnings received on the way here, we point towards it, and almost at once a black cloud comes up and hides it from our view, then more clouds and the country east of us shows signs of rain, then a few drops and we too are in the thick of it. Batu Lawi has vindicated its reputation already. After a fortnight\u2019s fine weather enabling us to get thus far in quite good time, we have but to point at this dread mountain and down comes the rain. [To get ahead of my diary for a moment, I may say that it continued wet for practically the whole of the next fortnight!]. To the north and north-east of us lie the Adang hills stretching away towards that huge range in the East; the valley below us runs north and south, the northern end opening out at the kuala Madihit.\n\nMay 20th: (Temp. 73.4\u00b0). Out early this morning, only to find the place in thick clouds and everything sopping wet. Last night (1 a.m.) we were awakened by a terrific crash of thunder, immediately overhead; this was followed by torrents of rain, which speedily came through the wretched leaf roof. I got a kajang rigged up over me, but not before most things were wet. The smoke is most irritating and everyone is coughing and choking from it. Most of the inmates have watery eyes and no wonder. It is the same type of house as the other Murut and Kalabit houses we have passed, and in the common room there was three fire places in use, besides the others in the living rooms. The raised flaps of the roof under which we sit draw all the smoke out and the only habit-\nable spot is on the wooden platform outside the end of the house; it is quite nice sitting out there in the evening with a glorious view all round, but too hot to stay there in the heat of the day. A scaly ant-eater (*Manis javanica*) is brought in having been captured by the dogs of the house.\n\nOwing to the thickness of the mist they will not be able to dry any paddy to-day for us to take, so we shall have to wait here to-morrow before starting off again. There appears to be no chance of getting any more coolies, so all we can do is to carry enough food for ten days, which should enable us to do the journey to Batu Lawi and back and no more; but I hope we can shoot something and find a little jungle produce to enable us to stay there a few days; however the chief thing is to get there first.\n\nWent out in the morning down the hill on the north side of the house and heard the waters of the Madihit below us. It appears to run in a south-easterly direction (i.e., following it from the mouth it runs south as far as the kuala Aripenou and thence south-east past this hill). I cannot make out which is Mt. Obong and which is Mt. Molu of the high peaks in the range to the west of us; this has been a source of argument the whole way up, some saying one thing and others flatly contradicting; the only thing that is clear is that the whole range is the Molu Range; the highest is a double peak and to the north of that (in the same range) are four other peaks whose bearings I read as 281\u00b06, 290\u00b04, 287\u00b05 and 300\u00b02 respectively. The first they tell me is the source of the Seridan river, which runs into the Mago and thence into the Tutau and Baram.\n\nMay 21st: (Temp. 76\u00b0). A nice fine morning and every prospect of drying the paddy and getting off to-morrow. After a bath under a bamboo pipe stuck into the hill side,\u2014the only water to be obtained here, we go off collecting in different directions. Catch some interesting insects, among them an interesting female Chalcosid moth, which mimics the common Pierine butterfly *Terias hecabe*; the male is entirely different in colouring and pattern.* The beautiful *Papilio brookeanus* appears to be common. The collectors bring in a large male \u201cbrok\u201d (*Macacus nemestrinus*) and a fine bushy-tailed squirrel (*Rhithrosciurus macrotis*).\n\nI amused the company and myself by measuring the right-hand thumb to little finger stretch of 25 men (adults). They were as follows:\n\n| Sea-Dayaks. | Tabuns. | Kalabits. | Muruts. |\n|-------------|---------|-----------|--------|\n| 21.4 cm.    | 21.4 cm. (Belulok) | 21.8 cm. | 20.7 cm. |\n| 20.\u2014        | 20.\u2014    | 19.7      | 19.9   |\n| 21.4        | 20.\u2014    | 20.6      | \u2014      |\n| 21.\u2014        | 19.2 (Tama Be'ulok) | 20.3     |        |\n\n*Mention is made of this instance of mimicry in a short account of mimetic Bornean insects by the writer, recently published in the Proceedings of the Entomological Society of London. 1911. pp. lxiii\u2014lxxx.*\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 63, 1912.\nI also obtained Penribut's permission to measure two old skulls which were hanging up on the centre wall of the house. He offered no objections, but seemed a little nervous lest I should want to take them away with me. The measurements were as follows (worked out with the aid of little volume issued by the Royal Geographical Society for the use of travellers):\n\n| Measurement                                      | I       | II      |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Length from fore-head to occiput                 | 190 mm. | 172 mm. |\n| Greatest breadth                                  | 131 mm. | 134 mm. |\n| Circumference fore-head to back of head          | 534 mm. | 495 mm. |\n| Shape                                             | ovoid   | ovoid   |\n| Front edge of foramen magnum to top of nose      | 102 mm. | 106 mm. |\n| do. to juncture of front teeth                   | 101 mm. | 100 mm. |\n| Outer edges of orbital bones                      | 114 mm. | 113 mm. |\n| Outer edge (widest measurement) zygomatic arch   | \u2014       | 130 mm. |\n| Vertex to below chin                              | 185 mm. | 183 mm. |\n| jaw very prominent                                |        |         |\n| adult male                                       | 68.977.9|         |\n\nCephalic index = \\(\\frac{B}{L} \\times 100\\)\n\nBoth skulls were old and black with smoke; according to Penribut, probably Muruts of the upper Trusan or Bar country; but no very exact data forthcoming.\n\nThere is a wretched cripple in this house with a tied knee joint, which keeps him for ever in a squatting position, so that he can neither stand or sit; he seems quite cheerful. The women are cleaner, pleasant-featured and friendly; they are not at all shy and watch me bathe under the bamboo pipe with much interest; we try a conversation but without success, neither of us being able to speak a language known to the other. Like the Kalabits at Kuala Madihit, they are tattooed on the legs and arms, and they boast but one garment, a short dark blue or black skirt; their hair is loosely fastened up behind and ornamented with a broad band of beads worn like a cap. These beads are their only possession of value, and I was told that an insignificant light brown type of bead, if genuinely old, was valued the highest.\n\nA Kalabit from the Seridan brings dire rumours of disaster to Tama Belulok's relatives in the Tutau (Oyau Blawing's house); he says the inhabitants of the whole village (some 30 families) have died from some new disease about two months ago, except for five people. Tama Belulok and his people are much disturbed at the news and suggest a desire to return. Luckily we had only just been discussing the unreliability of rumours heard in a far off\n\nJour. Straits Branch\ncountry like this and I was able to show that one of them at all events was quite inaccurate. Belulok had told me that the news of the Rajah Muda's death had reached him last year and that it was generally believed all over that district; he was quite surprised to hear that, although it was true the Rajah Muda had been very ill, he had quite recovered now and was expected in Sarawak again before long. There was another rumour current here to the effect that a Dutch Contr\u00f4leur had been killed by the natives in the head-waters of the Batang Kayan not many days journey from here; this too I contradicted, having heard in Sarawak that this Dutch official, reported missing for some time, had come through safely after all. [I heard on my return in July that there was probably some truth in the Kalabit story after all, as inquiries were still being made for that particular official]. It took a long time to persuade the Tabuns not to take this rumour too literally and I went so far as to predict that it was more likely five men had died and the rest survived, not the other way about, as the Kalabit reported. Yet another story was current, this time, that the Government had forbidden any Kalabit to go down river for four years because of this dread disease, and further that if any of them disobeyed, the down-river tribes had been given permission to take their heads!!\n\nTama Belulok is ill with fever to-day, and is afraid he will not be well enough to go to-morrow.\n\nMay 22nd: (Temp. 75\u00b0, cloudy). Begin dividing out the rice, a tedious job which might have been done with advantage yesterday. Tama Belulok is worse this morning and decides to stay behind; I leave one of his men to look after him; Belulok (his son) takes his place as my chief adviser and interpreter. He took charge of my expedition last year, and feels that our failure then reflects in some measure on him, so that it is incumbent on him to get us through to Batu Lawi this time. Although quite young, he has a useful influence over the men; his information is usually reliable and his advice is undoubtedly sound. The worst of so many of these natives is that they never mind being shown up as liars, and they lie again at the first opportunity if it is to their interest to do so. For instance, when they wanted to stop at Klowat's house for the Dayak-Murut wedding (ten days ago) some of them swore positively that there was no place for us to spend the night between there and Salindong which we couldn't possibly reach that night. Unfortunately for them I had been there last year and so knew the nature of that bit of river, with the result that we pushed on and found quite a good place for a lancho (kuala Smarpit). Nearly every day similar instances cropped up, many that didn't matter, but some that did. Belulok was one of the few who never let me down in that way\u2014at least, not that I know of. They did not of course do it out of sheer perversity, but generally as an excuse for a delay or else in actual ignorance of the subject I inquired about. We start at 9.30 and follow a winding path\nthrough the jungle in a general easterly direction arriving at the Madihit again about 2 p.m. The river runs nearly north here but bends away to the west below us and to the east again above us. Penribut says the path leads straight up into the hills now and the next place for water is a long way ahead so we must spend the night here. We have had several stops, resulting in a balance of three and a half hours walking only\u2014a poor day\u2019s work. However I feel I have had quite enough and am glad to stop, especially as it is raining hard; we make a lancho on the right bank above and enjoy a delicious bathe in the cool clear water below, altitude 1,300 ft. Below us two little streams flow out into the Madihit from either bank; both called the Patud.\n\nMay 23rd: (Temp. 6 a.m. 69\u00b0). To-day nice and fine again; I hope to get in a long day\u2019s march.\n\nThis no sooner written than Penribut is reported to be desirous of staying here another day on account of a bad omen heard a few minutes ago, which warns him of trouble if he starts. After much persuasion with the help of Belulok, he goes back to his lancho to get ready his things for marching; only to return shortly after looking more obstinate than ever, having again heard the evil bird, which he says absolutely prevents his doing any journey to-day. After much good-tempered, but useless, argument I try to compromise and say that two of his men may stay and propitiate the bird provided they can get their friends to carry their loads. But this proposal is not acceptable so I insist on them all following, birds or no birds; and this they do with a good grace, although we have lost a good half hour by talking. Path leads straight up the hill and maintains a general easterly direction; I note the following altitudes: camp above the Madihit 1,400 ft., then up to 1,900 ft., 2,200 ft., 2,400 ft., 2,700 ft., 3,000 ft.; down to 2,720 ft., then up to a steep 500 ft. to 3,230 ft., whence we get a good view of the two peaks of Batu Lawi; the higher and steeper peak like a chimney lies to the north, the lower and more rounded peak to the south. The big range still impedes our view of the lower portion of Batu Lawi. To the north and parallel to us run the Raya Hills; the tall virgin jungle hides all other views.\n\nSaw two specimens of the \u201cmoth-like horsefly\u201d mentioned by St. John,* the first I have seen in the jungle though the insect\u2014a Cicada (*Tacua speciosa*, Illig.)\u2014is not rare at lamps in Sarawak. Later we disturbed another large Cicada (*Pomponia diffusa*, Bredd.) which flew straight into a large spider\u2019s web, where I watched it for some time struggling hopelessly to free itself; it was eventually \u201crescued\u201d with the aid of butterfly net. Considering the strong flight of the insect and its size (with tegmina expanded it\n\n*\u201cI found today, just as we were crossing the ridge, one of the most curious insects I have ever seen; it appeared like a gigantic moth, above four inches in length, and was of a brown colour, with a band of bright green just across its neck; although it had the look of a moth, on closer examination it proved to be a great horsefly.\u201d Spenser St. John, *op. cit.* pp. 85-86.\nmeasures 150 mm., while vertex of head to end of abdomen measures 48 mm.), it was rather surprising that the web should hold it so effectually. Belulok caught a large Sphingid (Hawk-moth, *Oxyambulyx substrigilis*, Westw.) by the side of the path. Rain again in the afternoon which developed into a heavy thunderstorm as we stopped to make a lancho for the night (alt. 3,100 ft.), and now as I write (8 p.m.) it has started again with renewed vigour. We passed little streams or pools of water in two or three places on the way and I pointed out that the first or second would have done well for last night's lancho. At 2 o'clock this afternoon we came to one and the Kalabits wanted to stop with the same excuse as yesterday, but this time I said he would push on till we did find some more water. With our short supply of food, the long distance to be covered and the uncertainty of the path, it is necessary to push on at every opportunity.\n\nMay 24th: (Temp. 6 a.m. 67\u00b0). Several of the party with bad colds, and cuts and sores on their feet, but generally cheerful. Our path to-day leads along the top of a ridge at a fairly even altitude of 3,100 ft. for two hours; then up to 3,700 ft. and after a short descent we have another long climb up to the summit of this part, 4,000 ft., which according to Penribut is called Mt. Turan.\n\nAlthough the natives with me have not been able to recognize any of St. John's names for the mountains of this part, I think St. John must have reached this range and then turned north towards the Adang villages. His route appears to have run parallel to mine from the Madihit to the Limbang, only further to the north and over a lower country as he records 2,500 ft. as the highest altitude crossed between the two rivers, while we have already touched 4,000 ft. (and later 5,000 ft.) without coming to the Limbang yet. Our general direction is still East, and the path shut in on all sides by old jungle prevents our obtaining any view except for an occasional glimpse though the trees on some of the higher elevations. We camp late in the afternoon to the usual accompaniment of pouring rain (alt. 3,900 ft.). Thermometer down to 67\u00b0 at sunset. One of the collectors shot a rare Oriole (*Oriolus hosei*, Sharpe). Rarely seen or hear any signs of animal life, except for the occasional cry of a Wa-Wa (*Hylobates m\u00fclleri*, the Gibbon). Water has not been found all day, except just now at a little pool some way below our present camp, and we have had to satisfy ourselves with some from the roots of trees, which hold quite a lot when one cuts off lengths of the right kind. Penribut says we shall reach the river Kri-to-morrow where we shall see the whole of Batu Lawi quite close; he does not know the path any further than that. Temperature 67\u00b0 at sundown.\n\nMay 25th: (6 a.m. temp. 65.5\u00b0). Left camp early and at once continue the ascent reaching 4,460 ft., the head-waters of the Madihit are pointed out running parallel to us in the valley below\non our right; our general direction is E. S. E. until we reach a high ridge and follow it south, alt. 4,700 ft. to 5,000 ft. This is evidently the top of the high range which barred our view of Batu Lawi from Penribut\u2019s house, as we can now see through the trees the whole mountain opposite and apparently quite close. We camp in a sheltered hollow a little way down the eastern slope of this hill, which is called Mt. Derian,* having walked for a bare three hours from our last camping place; temperature at 2 p.m. down to 62\u00b0 Fahr. (rain). Our first day\u2019s walk was similarly short, so that it ought to be possible to accomplish the journey so far in two long days\u2019 walk instead of four. However yesterday and the day before were long and tiring, up and down these steep hills, and the men are heavily burdened. I have just said that we had a fine view of Batu Lawi from this point, but as a matter of fact the jungle is so thick that one can only catch a glimpse of its outlines and for the greater part of the day it was hidden in clouds. Madu, my Land-Dayak boy, volunteered to climb a tree and off came his coat with which he tied his feet securely together (or rather about twelve inches apart) and up he went hand over hand, gripping the trunk of the tree with the soles of his feet which were prevented from slipping by the coat. He soon disappeared up the smooth straight trunk into the branches high up over our heads, out of sight and almost out of earshot. He told us, when he came down, that there appeared to be a deep valley between us and Batu Lawi, but that two spurs sloped down towards it one on our left and the other on our right. Poor little Madu, he died from dysentry three months after we got back. He stood about 4 ft. 10 in., but strong and well-made at that; always bright and cheerful, the life and soul of the party, everybody made friends with him at once; many a time he amused us greatly ordering the Kalabits and Muruts about in a loud voice and it was quite wonderful to see how they did what he wanted, for they didn\u2019t know a word of each other\u2019s language. I had been particularly keen to bring him for that particular reason, as it has been suggested that the Land-Dayaks and Muruts show evidences of relationship in their languages. I frequently made him talk Land-Dayak to both Muruts and Kalabits, but they never understood him nor could they find a word in common. Also, try as he might, he could only understand a word of Murut or Kalabit. Later we tried with Penan, but beyond a few words of wide distribution in Malaya (such as ramin, house, ta\u2019in, stomach, dipeu, tooth, etc.) their languages proved quite unintelligible to one another. Madu was quite a travelled native, especially for a Land-Dayak, who as a rule is rather stay-at-home and unenterprising;\n\n*According to the natives, so-named on account of a huge Durian? tree growing on the path along the top. The tree was certainly unlike the cultivated Durian and according to my Dayaks, quite unlike any wild Durian; one suggested subsequently that \u2018Derian\u2019 was the Kalabit for \u2018Dian\u2019, meaning that the tree was one of those kinds whose bark makes good torches. We were unable to solve the point.\nhe had been in Singapore and the Native States, besides having travelled in Sarawak a good deal. We had talked over several expeditions to be made together in the future, but alas, now to no purpose.\n\nRain all this afternoon and temperature down to $62^\\circ$ at 2 p.m. A few mosquitoes in the evening\u2014rather surprising at this altitude.\n\nMay 26th: None of the party know the way any further and there appears to be no path except the one we have come by and that continues south to the Bar plain as far as I can make out; it is so overgrown and hard to find that Penribut missed it several times on the way here. A small party go out to look for some sort of track, others go off collecting, while a few remain to cut down some trees so that we can dry our things in the sun. Since leaving the Madihit we have hardly been in the glare of the sun a moment owing to the dense jungle over our heads practically the whole time. Clothes have been dried (or rather smoked) over fires whenever opportunity offered.\n\nIn this wet and cold spot, with the thermometer at midday under $70^\\circ$ (it varies from $62^\\circ$-$67^\\circ$) there seemed to be a great absence of animal, bird and insect life, and the \"din\" of a tropical night was noticeably absent. One occasionally heard the warning crack of some giant of the jungle about to fall.* The natives always took great care to build our lanchos out of reach of any rotten trees. Eight Kalabits arrive with the remainder of our baggage which was left at Penribut's house for them to bring. They should have joined us there, but said the Madihit was in flood so that they couldn't get across. The head of them, a sour-looking individual, Lawaratu by name, is supposed to know the path all the way to Batu Lawi, but now informed us that he does not. The path-seekers returned with the report of a hopeless track down the river Kri which rises just below us; they suggest looking for another path to-morrow. Belulok estimates it as two or three days yet before we get there; it looks to me but one day's walk. St. John must have reached the northern end of this range before turning north to the Adang villages which are said to be about three days journey from here. Mt. Derian rises to the westward higher than I thought, about 5,200 ft. and to the south and parallel to it there runs another short range with one high peak about 5,600 ft. The Madihit is said to rise between these two.\n\n*As an instance of the danger of falling trees I may mention a narrow escape I had on another occasion (on trip to Mt. Klingkang). After walking for some hours our party came to a tempting stream and many of us bathed in the cool clear water. I had only finished and climbed out of the pool a bare two minutes, before a huge tree fell right across the place. There was no wind at the time, and but for a warning crack before its actual fall, some of the natives might easily have been caught. In an interval of five days no less than three large trees had fallen along or across our path to that mountain, in a distance of some seven miles.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 63. 1912.\nThe natives in their scanty clothing find it very cold at night, many of them lie huddled up round the fires. One or two complain of fever, others of stomach trouble or colds. The food is getting short so we cannot afford another day here looking for a path.\n\nMay 27th: (Temp. 7 a.m. 63\u00b0). We start off along the mountains in a southern direction, then descend east to the river Kri, alt. 3,700 ft., continue down that river knee-deep till 11 a.m. when we come across the remains of a hut recently used by Dayak gutta-hunters. It has been a most tedious morning scrambling along the river bed, or river bank, over huge boulders, \"tight-rope-walking\" along fallen trees which the natives invariably makes straight for, regarding such as Heaven-sent bridges; the European is inclined to regard them in another light, especially when they span a mountain torrent, swirling along some thirty feet below one. The Kalabits wanted to stop at this place as we could find no trace of any further path, so we did\u2014but only for a meal and then on again up the hill, Bululok and I acting as guides. By my compass I knew that Batu Lawi was on our right and that by following the stream on down any further we were likely to be led too far to the north, so we cut straight up over the hill, a stiff scramble on hands and knees with parangs in constant use to cut a way through the undergrowth, which was not very thick luckily, owing to the tall trees overhead. The natives with their heavy loads had a bad time of it, but some of them deserved it for pretending not to know the way. The Kalabits in particular have seemed more and more disinclined each day to bring us to Batu Lawi; they must know the way in reality, as they once lived quite near here, according to Penribut; although I have not heard them mention it, I think it is because each day brings us nearer to the country of their enemies, the dread Pa Brian people, who live the other side of Batu Lawi. Later we struck a path running more or less in the right direction which we followed for some two hours and a half. At one place we were startled at seeing fresh blood on the ground, and an examination of the leading half dozen showed that it could not have come from any of them, as although most exhibited the attentions of leeches, cuts or other wounds, none could have been the cause of so much blood. We looked in vain for traces of some animal; some uneasily murmured \"munsu\" (enemy) and for some ten minutes we sat down and discussed the mystery; eventually a Murut joined us and owned up to a nasty cut across the hand which thus explained the whole thing, as he had been sitting on that spot some time and then gone off down the hill side to look for water to bathe it. But for those few minutes we were much puzzled by the unpleasantly suggestive \"mystery.\" There was a fine rubber tree (gutta rian) close by here, and the Dayaks pointed out several of one kind and another on our journey; these tracts of virgin jungle must still be very rich in this kind of produce, as natives from down-river seldom venture so far as this, and the scattered inhabitants only work sufficient to meet their immediate\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nwants, i.e., enough to pay the annual tax of $2 to Government and to support them on the rare occasion of a visit to a bazaar down-river or on the coast.\n\nOur path led down to a tongue of land formed by the junction of two streams, both called Kri according to Penribut, alt. 2850 ft. Crossed and camped on the right bank, just succeeding in erecting the huts before the rain came on. Examined the provisions with Belulok and find they have enough for four days more. Cheery prospect, seeing that we are not at Batu Lawi yet and that we have taken six days to come so far. However there are some sago palms near by, which they will have to utilize together with any animals we may shoot.\n\nMay 28th: (Temp. 7 a.m. 70\u00b0). We ascend the hill behind our camp and then descend almost immediately to another stream, the Limbang again, alt. 2,630 ft., only much smaller than when last we saw it at the kuala Madihit. There was a good deal of water running and we crossed with some difficulty having a very stiff scramble up the high precipitous bank on the other side, followed immediately by a weary toil up a thousand feet and down again to yet another stream, the Palabar, alt. 2,700 ft. Most of us had good cause to remember that steep climb up from the Limbang as we had to pass a hornet\u2019s nest. I was bitten through the sleeve of my coat and had a swollen arm for the next two days; several of the others suffered too.\n\nThe natives of this part refer to the Limbang as the Pa (River) Brunei and I was told that formerly the main outlet was through Brunei; this has become more or less silted up and only a narrow ditch remains, while the river has taken a sharp bend to the East, flowing out into Brunei Bay at the Limbang mouth, as we now know it. Batu Lawi should be very near now and with every hope of being on it before night-fall we cross the stream and start another steep ascent for the most part pathless, eventually reaching an altitude of 4,400 ft. where we have to camp as we are doubtful of finding any water further up. The last hour or so in pouring rain, and rather than stand about getting cold, Belulok, a Dayak and I continue the ascent, leaving the others to make our shelters for the night. From the occasional glimpses we have had of Batu Lawi I thought we were actually on the lower slopes of it, but Belulok thought otherwise and so it proved, for a rough scramble up roots and moss-grown boulders brought us to the summit 4,850 ft. and there just opposite to us with a broad ravine between stood Batu Lawi emerging for a moment through the driving clouds. From St. John\u2019s map I take this mountain to be Selinguid, though none of our people know that name and the Kalabits profess all ignorance of the name of the mountain. [It struck me afterwards that it was possibly no sheer \u201ccussedness\u201d that made the Kalabits refuse to utter the names of these places for my information, but more likely that they held the place in such awe that mere mention of its name would bring disaster. Thus many\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 63, 1912.\nnatives in Sarawak when asked will not give the name of their destination (i.e., if it entails a lengthy and perhaps perilous journey), for fear of exciting the wrath of the guardian spirit of that place, so they refer to it in very roundabout terms. The name Batu Lawi was hardly if ever mentioned (except by me) during the days we approached it, and I noticed that the Tabuns did not seem much surprised at the absence of any known name for Selinguid. The superstition is I suppose much the same as that which forbids a Sea-Dayak to mention the names of his parents-in-law and those of their relations; or to give his own name when asked. In this latter instance he usually turns to a friend with a nod as much as to say \"Tell him my name, he doesn't know our customs or he would not have asked me.\" Many have their names very conveniently tattooed on their fore-arms, so that when one wishes to ask this awkward question and no friend is near to help, the arm may be produced for the silent inspection of the questioner.\n\nThe summit of Selinguid is bare of all trees and only covered with a tangled mass of shrubs and moss which effectively cover some splendid pitfalls between huge great blocks of stone. Batu Lawi was close enough to enable us to make out individual trees and the perpendicular stratification of the rocks; the lower of the two peaks looks easily climbable, but I doubt the possibility of being able to climb the higher one, which rose sheer for some six hundred like a chimney, practically bare of all vegetation. It bore due East of Selinguid and this accounts for our mistaking Selinguid for the lower slopes of Batu Lawi, when trying to make out the lay of the land through the trees on Mt. Derian due west of us. Thick clouds develop into heavy rain and we descend to the camp arriving just before dark, after a weary day of nearly ten hours' walking. The beautiful cool climate and mountain air however allow one to do it without feeling anything but healthy fatigue at the end of the day, which all passes off after a sound sleep in a really cold night. At dusk the thermometer registers $63^\\circ$ in the shade.\n\nMay 29th: (Temp. at 7 a.m. $64^\\circ$). Left our camp about 8 o'clock with 14 men to get to Batu Lawi; the others staying behind to recover from their several ailments (cold, fever, cuts, sore feet, etc.) and to do some collecting. As the summit of Selinguid rose between us, we had to make a detour round the southern slope before reaching the narrow valley which runs north and south between the two mountains. This entailed some very difficult going through pathless jungle of quite a different character to that on the other side of the mountain where our camp was situated. There we were hidden in the usual type of virgin jungle, viz. enormous high trees with interlacing branches forming a canopy far over our heads, and down below a thin growth which was not difficult to walk through. This new type of jungle on the southern and eastern slopes of Selinguid (including the summit) consisted of low-growing gnarled shrubs rarely more than ten feet high; these in turn were covered in thick moss especially round the roots.\nwhich twisted and turned round and across great blocks of limestone, the whole forming one long and wearisome series of obstacles, each in itself a delightfully uncertain danger. Thus one false step and down would go one leg to unknown depths; then a slippery root would resent the unaccustomed weight of a human being and down some-body else would go through this treacherous floor. One Murut in front of me disappeared entirely just as if the ground had opened to receive him; luckily however he landed on a rock some eight feet below and came to no harm. We struggled through this down to the bottom of the ravine where a lovely mountain stream, the Palabar again, came rushing down in a south-westerly direction dividing the two mountains.\n\nAcross this and we were on Batu Lawi at last, alt. 3,740 ft.\n\nThe same kind of growth made our progress very slow for the first part up the other side; but this soon changed to the higher kind of jungle, so we moved on quicker to a ridge on which we eventually camped a little after midday at an altitude of 4,900 ft. (temp. 65\u00b0 in the shade). We passed some likely looking places for rhinoceros and at one place found some fairly fresh traces of one. The Kalabits say they are always to be found on the eastern side of Batu Lawi. Penans are said to get them with their sumpitan (blow-pipes), which seemed to me incredible considering the delicate nature of the darts they use and the thick hide of the rhino, but the Tabuns assured me that it was so and some Penans I met later confirmed it. After a short meal, a Dayak and I continued the ascent, reaching an altitude of 5,660 ft. on the southern end of Batu Lawi. Thick clouds alternating with driving rain destroyed all chances of a view and we descended again to the lancho on the ridge below.\n\nMay 30th: (7.30 a.m. temp. 64\u00b0). Ascend again this morning with some 9 or 10 natives, Penribut, Belulok and Madu among them; this time keeping along below the place where we ascended yesterday, we followed a narrow ledge of rock which brought us to a point below the gap between the two peaks. A sheer drop of some two or three hundred feet here faced us, and above us a slippery rock face with but little vegetation; two Dayaks made use of a loose root and pulled themselves up a little bit higher, but I stayed on the ledge with the others not liking to risk it in the rain which made everything so dangerously slippery. The height of the ledge was 5,660 ft. and the temperature 69\u00b0 between 9 and 10 a.m. We waited there for some time hoping to get a view, but the clouds only allowed us a glimpse of the high peak towering above us\u2014another 600 feet at most I calculated. The lower peak could certainly be climbed without difficulty from the southern end, but that sheer column\u2014the higher peak\u2014seemed to present a very difficult problem.\n\nWe saw tracks of some small mammals, a tiger-cat according to the natives, and I noticed but one butterfly (an Hesperid, probably Bibasis uniformis, Elwes), otherwise the absence of animal\nlife was remarkable. We were certainly unfortunate in striking a particularly wet 24 hours on the mountain which partly accounted for this dearth no doubt, but I imagine that dense humidity was the rule rather than the exception up there, so that animal life was probably not encouraged to flourish. The actual rock commences at 5,250 ft. We returned to our lancho, packed up our few belongings and made our way slowly down the hill; then up through that unpleasant tangled growth the other side and so back to our old camp on Selinguid, arriving just after dark tired out. The collectors had shot some interesting birds in our absence and captured several insects new to me.\n\nMay 31st: Climb up to the top of Selinguid again this morning and at last enjoy a splendid view of the country all round. Take some photographs of Batu Lawi [unfortunately all failures owing to lack of sufficient precautions against the excessive damp]. Butterflies plentiful on the top and we spend most of the day up there. Two Dayaks follow the ridge along the top and across a narrow ravine on the northern side and so on to the northern end of Batu Lawi. They returned at nightfall and report it much easier going than the route used by us yesterday; they succeeded in reaching the foot of the higher peak, but were unable to climb this. The top of Selinguid extends some 300 yards in a north-easterly direction, narrow and more or less flat although the growth on the top makes it difficult to move. In a secluded spot away from our butterfly-collectors I found two of our Dayaks making themselves comfortable for a pleasant morning nap; they were in the hopes of obtaining fortunate dreams, as the tops of high mountains are always said to be infested by spirits and the chances of experiencing an important dream in this hallowed spot were too good to be missed. I left them to their occupation with instructions to report if the dreams were favourable so that I might then turn them on to a little collecting which would in that case be undoubtedly profitable.\n\nJune 1st: Food has run very short and we leave about 7 a.m. on the return journey, after catching the Dayaks in an attempt at leaving with particularly light burdens. These Pandaruan Dayaks have been more trouble than use on the whole\u2014always last and lagging, wanting to stop first, and making a fuss over the smallest hardship. The Saribas Dayaks with me are very different, cheerfully doing more than their due share of hard work. The Tabuns and Murtus give no trouble under Belulok, and the Kalabits under Penribut usually do what they are told without much persuasion. A lot depends on their headmen and I am unlucky in the head of these eleven Pandaruan Dayaks. However they are in the minority and with a few suggestive remarks at their expense we start, the baggage evenly divided. Our pace down hill is very different to that when struggling up and we get down to the Palabar and over the steep bit and down again to the Limbang again before very long. Here we find the river has risen consider-\nably and we have to spend some time felling trees in order to bridge it. Later we pass our former camp at the junction of the two rivers Kri and then begins that long toil up the further Kri, which has also risen slightly to impede us. We reach our old camp on Mt. Derian about 6 p.m. and stragglers came in later with torches. One Dayak fell out and had to be carried in the last mile. The natives had left a little rice here on the way out and we enjoyed a much-wanted meal after a strenuous day's work. I had eaten a little at midday, but many of them had finished their food in the morning before we started and so had gone without any more till this evening. The Dayaks were accused of commandeering half the Tabuns' deposit of rice, while the latter were not looking; however they apparently had enough to satisfy their wants and I was far too tired to go into the matter.\n\nJune 2nd: (6.30 a.m. temp. 62\u00b0). Another long day's walk from Mt. Derian down to our old camp above the Rapaw stream, thus accomplishing two day's journey in one. Luckily it has been moderately fine all to-day and yesterday, except for a slight shower about 2 o'clock. But still dampness is part and parcel of travel in Borneo and the day's journey is very often commenced by fording a stream waist-high, or failing that one is soon wet through from perspiration, so that a shower or two of rain does not make much difference. I very often used to bathe just as I stood in my clothes if we came to a tempting stream or waterfall, and never seemed to derive any harm from it.\n\nJune 3rd. Soon after leaving camp this morning we came to a small opening on our right from which we can get a last sight of Batu Lawi (excepting the view of the top of the higher peak to be seen from Penribut's house). The following sketch gives an idea of it; the sloping line at the base indicating the line of the Turan-Derian range which cuts off all view of Mt. Selinguid lying between it and the lower slopes of Batu Lawi. The base of Batu Lawi (taking the Palabar stream which flows between it and Selinguid as the base line) is some 3,500 ft. above the sea-level and the mountain itself rises about 2,700 ft. higher. Approximately 1,000 ft. of the mountain are visible in the sketch.\n\nMt. Batu Lawi\n\nShowing above the Derian range (A.B).\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 63, 1912.\nWe reach the Madihit again about 11 o'clock and after a refreshing bath and a meal proceed on to Penribut's house arriving a little after 3 p.m., most of the natives done up after the last three days hard walking on short commons; I too was quite glad of a rest.\n\nThey told us that Tama Belulok had returned home after staying four days longer in the house. A new report has come in to the effect that only two men of Oyau Blawing's house have died, not the whole house except five as first reported! They also report that a Dutch controleur and his servant have been killed by one Maalin of Long Krian not far from the head-waters of the Baram.\n\nJune 4th. Spent the anniversary of King George the Third's birthday in Penribut's house settling up with the natives. The usual wage recognized by the Government in this district is 30 cents a day and it takes some time working out the amount due to each man, as so many have joined me at different dates. We have to settle up here as I am sending the Pandaruan Dayaks, the Dayak collectors and some of the Muruts back by the way we came, i.e., down the Madihit and the Limbang, while I intend going round the southern end of Mt. Molu to join the tributaries of the Baram river and so down to the Government station (Claudetown) on that river. This round has never been done before and further travelling among strange tribes will sure to prove interesting. Only Belulok, another Tabun, Madu and the cook are to accompany me with a few Kalabits to help carry our baggage.\n\nHaving no money with me, series of I. O. U.'s. have to be issued in the duly approved and very convenient way of the Glorious East. As a matter of fact money is of little or no use to the natives up here unless they make the journey to the coast where they can exchange it for goods of more value in their eyes, viz. beads, jars, gongs, gun-powder, etc. These chits of mine will therefore be kept till they go down river, when they will be duly honoured at the Government station. Being entirely enable to read or write, these up-river natives have a great respect for anything in the way of a printed or written note, and Mr. Ermien, the Government Officer then in charge of this district, had kindly given me two or three printed Government \"surat panggil\" (Government summons forms) to use in case of having difficulties in obtaining coolies. But so far I have not had occasion to use any. Belulok asked my assistance in recovering a debt of one buffalo and a quantity of rubber from a Kalabit here, who, he said, had been owing him that for some time. Of course I had no power to do anything of the sort and told him so; but he said be quite understood that and all he wanted was an all-powerful \"surat\"\u2014it didn't matter what, any scrap of paper with some writing on it would do, he said, as the Kalabit could not read (nor could he for the matter of that)\u2014so I gave him an old envelope which bore my name and address and with this talisman he succeeded in recovering a certain amount of rubber ($20 or $30 worth) there and then! What wicked un-\ntruths he saw fit to tell about the power of the surat I did not inquire about. Some of my belongings have been left at Pun-bawang's house, and Lawaratu and his men go off to get it; they agree to take it straight to the Seridan river, our next objective; while another Kalabit goes off to arrange for a boat to meet us on the Seridan.\n\nIn the evening we have a little rifle practice on an old tree some hundred yards from the house. The Kalabits are much astonished at the penetration of the bullets which they carefully dig out with their parangs. A .303 rifle had been brought specially to deal with a rhinoceros, but alas to no purpose. I must hope for better luck on another expedition to this region.\n\nJune 5th. We all set out together after a cordial farewell of Penribut and his men, and then our paths soon divide, the party for Limbang keeping straight on across the end of the valley and then north to the kuala Madihit, while we turn to the left and head in a south-westerly direction for the Seridan. Eight Kalabits come with us to carry our things, of whom four are women, as we cannot get sufficient men. Lawaratu asked me if I minded women carrying my things instead of men and I said if he and his men were not ashamed to let the women do their work I didn't mind. This was apparently rather lost on him, for they told me after it was quite customary for Kalabit women to do this sort of thing and the women rather enjoyed it than otherwise; certainly the four fat and smiling damsels who accompanied me looked cheerful enough, and they accomplished the rather tiring journey to-day without any particular sign of fatigue. That unpleasant skin disease \"kurap\" so prevalent among the natives here, somewhat detracted from their personal appearance.\n\nAn up and down walk brings us to the Malinau river (quite a small stream, not to be confused with the Malinau river which flows into the Tutau), alt. 920 ft. The path is so shut in by trees that we can get no view of the surrounding country at all; we cross the Lewin stream and later in the afternoon strike the Seridan river, quite a large stream. After an hour's walk through paddy farms along this river we come to a lofty bamboo brigade suspended from two huge trees overhanging the river; this leads to a fine Kalabit house built on the right bank. We learnt that most of the men had moved down river yesterday to the next house and that all the Kalabit houses of this district were sending down their annual tax to the Government station at Claudetown, so that it was an excellent opportunity for us to take passage with them. We accordingly borrowed two men and a small boat to take us down then and there, after paying off our Kalabit luggage-bearers (men and women) with the usual I. O. U. The rapids on this river are not bad and we poled down for an hour before reaching Balang Katou's house at sunset.\n\nThis Kalabit house is much larger than any we have seen on the Madihit, and is full of men this evening all gathered together\nfrom the neighbourhood for the annual trip down river. This excursion is a big undertaking and involves innumerable delays; first the head of each village has to seek good omens before he can start on the preliminary journey which is to bring him to this rendezvous. Once there, boats have to be looked out, fitted, repaired and generally re-made altogether, as they are only used on this one occasion each year (or every two years), small canoes being much handier for any short journeys between one village and another. Balang Katou\u2019s house had been unfortunate, having lost several people lately from some mysterious illness, apparently like cholera. There were three corpses in the house while I was there, each in a jar, well covered up, and standing in the room of the bereaved family. They warned me against sleeping in that house as the smell was said to be most offensive; however it was not so really, although they had been there some 20 to 30 days each, for I slept away from them in the long common verandah under the open flap of the roof, with the rest of our little party. When a Murut person of rank dies, his next of kin who acts as chief mourner may not leave the presence of the dead, and both living and dead occupy the same small room for some ten days on end. In a hot climate like this, the painful nature of this ordeal may be better imagined than described.\n\nIt is amusing to watch the Kalabit girls of the house summoning the visitors to a meal. This is prepared in the living rooms and when ready a young girl is usually sent out to call the visitors in from the long common verandah. They take not the slightest notice of her, and she stands at the door, rather a pathetic little figure, calling \u201ckuman, kuman\u201d (\u201cEat\u201d), at first in a low rather shy tone, eventually getting louder and more impatient, as she stands awaiting the men\u2019s pleasure. After perhaps ten minutes or quarter of an hour of this by-play the men rise, stretch themselves and follow her into the room with an amusing air of protest.\n\nThe start had been delayed a month, as Balang Katou had been unable to obtain good omens up till this morning; however all was plain sailing now, so he proposes to start tomorrow and pick up another contingent a little way down river, where he will wait for me. He wants to get the majority of his up-country friends off in his two large boats, as they are not accustomed to river-work and are more trouble than use in a boat. He accordingly deputes a relation of his, one Tamarpin, to get ready a small boat and bring me down as soon as possible. Tamarpin is a fat, smooth-tongued, conceited fellow contrasting very unfavourably with all the other natives that I have met in this region\u2014these latter always unaffected, courteous, though often blunt, and in fact true Nature\u2019s gentlemen. Tamarpin speaks Malay fluently, which I supposed he has picked up together with his Malay mannerisms, from two or three Brunei traders who often spend a month or two in a little house next door. These traders left four days ago with loads of rubber gained by trading up here.\nIn the evening I try to find out if they have ever heard of any other European making a visit to these parts, besides Mr. R. S. Douglas, the Resident of Baram, who visited Balang Katou\u2019s old house at the mouth of the Seridan on two occasions. These Kalabits used to live quite close to Batu Lawi, so they should know if anyone did. They say they have heard of a certain \u201cTuan Bunga\u201d (European collecting plants) making an expedition from Brunei some 20 years ago, and that his native collectors reached Batu Lawi, though he himself did not. I could get no information at all of this man from anyone on the Limbang or Madihit and I am inclined to think they were referring to Dr. Haviland (a keen botanist) who accompanied Mr. Ricketts up the Trusan in 1888, although in their account of that trip no mention is made of Batu Lawi at all (see p.\u2014antea). One old Kalabit said he had heard of Sir Spenser St. John\u2019s visit to the Adangs from his grandfather and that was all I could learn from them.*\n\nJune 6th: This house is very dirty and smoky, and as usual swarming with dogs, though not so bad as Penribut\u2019s house which has quite a local reputation for discomfort. Balang Katou and his men leave at dawn. Tamarpin reports that his wife and child are ill with fever so he wants to wait three days to look for good omens on their behalf. I notice that their illness did not prevent either of them from being up and about, so I gave him some quinine and told him we would start to-morrow. Lawaratu\u2019s men arrived at the house up-river last night and a boat was sent to bring them down this morning with the remainder of my things from the Madihit.\n\nJune 7th: An early start this morning, and we paddle or pole down the Seridan river for a short distance before joining the Mago which flows in from the east. The continuation of the two rivers takes the name of the Mago, which is a comparatively broad stream, and about an hour\u2019s journey further down we come to a large Kalabit house at Long Serin. Here we are met by Balang Katou and his men, somewhat drunk but still coherent. With so many visitors in their house they were making the most of the opportunity for a little conviviality and although it was barely 9\n\n*In an ascent of Mt. Penrissen at the head-waters of the Sarawak River in November 1909, I spent a night in the Land-Dayak village of Sennah, which lies practically at the foot of the mountain. There the old chief in reply to my questions, said he remembered Sir Hugh Low climbing the mountain, though he himself did not accompany him, being then only a little boy; and this took place some 65 years ago (vide Sarawak Gazettee, 1910, pp. 5-7 \u201cMt. Penrissen\u201d by the present writer). During a recent visit to Mt. Sennah some 29 miles from Kuching, I asked the old Land-Dayak \u201corang kaya\u201d (chief) who had lived all his life on the hill or at the foot of it, if he remembered Wallace spending a month up there 1855-1856. But he could only remember the first Rajah going there on several occasions and that he was often accompanied by other Europeans. The Chinese rebellion in Sarawak took place a year later (1857) and memories of those exciting times had superseded his recollections of any more peaceful incidents that had taken place before.\n\nR.A. Soc., No. 63, 1912.\nin the morning, a large number were somewhat the worse for drink. It reminded me of a Murut house I visited two years ago in the Lawas district near Mengalong; here we found the whole house absolutely drunk at 9 in the morning; all very friendly however and insistent on our staying the rest of the day to join in the revels, and it was with none too steady legs that we managed to get away from them and proceed with our journey some two hours later. The Muruts unfortunately have a great weakness for arrack (rice-beer) and the least event is made an excuse for a drinking bout of several days, so that it is by no means rare to find a house thus occupied, when journeying in their country. It naturally has a bad effect on their physical condition and drink must be put down as the cause of many of their unpleasant characteristics, e.g. indolence, dirt, skin diseases; though from what I have seen of the Muruts of the Lawas and Limbang, I should say that those who live up-river are far cleaner, healthier and more hard-working than those who live down-river within reach of a bazaar. The same thing is very noticeable too among the Land-Dayaks of Sarawak, who, if living near civilization, i.e., a Chinese bazaar, present a miserable example of the evils of drink and gambling, in sharp contrast to their sturdy relatives who live in the hills further inland, active, lithe of limb, hard-working and cheerful.\n\nThis Kalabit house has been visited by the same strange disease and many had died from it. Tamarpin asked permission for himself and his six men to go and talk with the dead for a few minutes before we continued our journey; he said it was the Kalabit custom, and shortly after I heard a kind of mournful chant issuing from a room near by and then again from a place just outside the house. Unlike the hideous noises, one usually imagines associated with the ceremonies of barbarous races, the songs of these Kalabits seemed to be almost European in their complex\u2014and at the same time tuneful-nature. Both this funeral chant and the drinking chorus we heard from the Kalabits at the Madihit were quite pleasant to listen to, which is more than one can say for the irritating cantations indulged in by Malays.\n\nThey wanted me to stay the night there, but I felt it necessary to push on down river to Claudetown as fast as possible in order to catch the next steamer for Kuching. There was absolutely no means of knowing when that was due and I could only trust to luck not to arrive a few hours or days after the steamer had left.\n\nA nice little fresh in the river helped us comfortably down the rapids which are not nearly so bad as those on the Limbang; the Mago flows in a south-westerly direction down to its junction with the Tutau which we reached between 3 and 4 p.m. and then camped on the right bank of that river. This is a fine wide reach here, made all the more imposing by tall jungle lining the banks on each side. We had a refreshing bathe here and I challenged Balang Katou to a race across to the other side; he won on the outward swim and I on the return\u2014rather to my surprise as I did not\nexpect an up-country Kalabit to be able to swim as far, if at all; many of them could not swim at all and only ventured to bathe quite close to the bank.\n\nJune 8th: Our way now lies up the Tutau, as it is too dangerous to follow this river down a long and narrow gorge through Mt. Molu, although the Tutau runs into the Baram river further down and by going that way we should shorten the journey considerably, but I understand from the natives that it can only be done when the river is in a certain condition and then only with the most experienced river-men; to try with these up-country Kalabits is out of the question. We have to go up-river therefore and then across country to join another river which will bring us into the Tutau a little before its junction with the Baram.\n\nAn early start is made, but all the boats bring up above the first rapid and every one gets out as a matter of course. After what I thought was a sufficient interval for a rest, I suggested we might move on, but was told that Balang Katou was waiting to hear his omen bird; so we sit, as I write this, patiently waiting for this important event. Perhaps ten minutes are spent in this way before we move off again. Balang Katou told me that the natives from up-country had been in his house for one month waiting for favourable omens! After three or four more halts for evil birds which have crossed our bows or delivered a warning note on the wrong side of the river, we reach Long Mutan in the afternoon. Find several others encamped here and some dozen boats drawn up, left by other parties doing the journey to Claudetown. The Kalabits have brought a great quantity of rubber with them, with which to pay their tax to Government and exchange for bazaar luxuries; this is too much for them to carry across in one journey so they intend to stay some two or three days here carrying it across by degrees. They say it is one day's walk across to the Sidam stream, where with any luck we may find a boat. A picturesque party these natives make, some cooking on the broad pebbly flat below our hut, others drying their scanty clothes, or others bathing in the river flowing gently by; the interminable jungle in front, behind and all round, forms a pleasant frame. The natives themselves are picturesque enough from a European's point of view, long-haired and long-eared (the lobe is pierced when they are very young and the hole is gradually made larger and larger, so that the lobe is stretched down some two inches, and ornamented with heavy metal ear-rings; the top of the ear is also pierced and adorned with a large tooth, usually a tiger-cat's), Their garments consist of just a loin cloth of red or dark blue cloth, and sometimes a short coat (usually sleeveless) made of bark or fibre; without this coat, their light bronze skins, neat well-balanced figures, graceful movements, especially in poling a boat when each muscle shows in play, not in the exaggerated way exhibited by the professional Strong Man, but in that far more reasonable and proportional development intended by Nature\u2014altogether form a very pleasant sight, and\nin such surroundings one sees perhaps the best phase of Man in relation to Nature.\n\nIn our large company of some 40 men there was one young Kalabit girl who, I learnt from Balang Katou, was a slave. She seemed a happy little party, rather pretty for a Kalabit, and always did her fair share of the work, paddling along in the middle of one of the boats, cooking, when we stop for the night, and later we saw her carrying a load of rubber through the jungle towards the Sidam. Several of these up-river tribes still keep slaves, and we had three or four with us on the walk to Batu Lawi, they being sent in place of their masters who had pleaded other engagements. It was some days before I knew that any of our coolies were really slaves and indeed from their treatment of one another it was quite impossible to guess which were slaves and which were not. Masters and slaves ate, slept, conversed or joked together with equal freedom; I was told that they usually become slaves owing to the death of their parents when quite young, so that they are left without anyone to look after them. If the child appears to be healthy a well-to-do native will buy him from his nearest relative and he thus becomes a slave. They do not ill-treat their slaves, for, as Belulok observed, it wasn't worth while to do so, since they would only run away and the money expended in their purchase would thus be thrown away. The system seems more on a parallel with that so common nowadays among the Chinese; for with that race, when a family is becoming too large, one of the later additions is sold to a friend to bring up as his own child, and the relationship between the child and the purchaser is probably much the same in each case. Among the Kalabits however I gathered that the slaves and their owners belonged to different classes, and that inter-marriage between the two was very rare.\n\nJune 9th. Left early this morning climbing the hill at the back of our camp and followed a well-worn winding path until midday when we came to a little camp occupied by two Brunei-Malays and some Dayaks. The Dayaks were carrying gutta across for them, in this way wiping off their debts to the Malays. These Dayaks had been working gutta for several months in the Batu Lawi district and they had got as far as Balang Katou's house on the return journey. There they met the Brunei traders, to whom they sold most of their gutta: they lived a whole year in the Kalabit house, helping the Kalabits on their farms and so earning their keep, but at the same time running further and further into debt with the Bruneis, who ran a fine business among the Kalabits alone. I believe nearly all the Kalabits of that district owed the Bruneis a certain amount, and this in spite of the 40 odd pikuls of gutta that they and the Dayaks had paid the Bruneis in return for bazaar goods. The Kalabits too were working off their debts by carrying loads of gutta across to the Sidam.\n\nAfter a short rest and some food we followed a narrow water-course on through the jungle down to the head of the Sidam proper,\nwhich we found nearly dry. The Bruneis had built a little hut here and had been waiting from some 6 days to get all their gutta across. They had two small canoes and two large boats here, but could not use them yet owing to the lack of water in the stream; I persuaded them to lend me one of the small boats and intended trying to continue the journey in her to-morrow.\n\nJune 10th. A little rain last night has caused the Sidam to rise slightly, but still hardly enough to float our small canoe. Only four of us can get in,\u2014a Brunei, Belulok, Madu and myself,\u2014the others are going to walk across to the Melana river and wait there till we can send up a boat to fetch them from the nearest Kayan house. The first hour is spent in wading down the Sidam and dragging the boat over the rocks; the boat which is very old and rotten resents this treatment and weakly sinks at the first stretch of deep water we come to. A large piece out of the bottom is the cause and we find it is far too bad to mend, so have to leave it there and rescue the cargo, luckily very little, as we had only brought bare necessities for two nights, leaving the rest to be carried overland to the Melana. Returned to our hut at Long Teboror about 11 o'clock and discussed what was the next thing to be done. Our immediate objective was a large Kayan house on the Apoh river; once there we could be passed on from house to house down the Apoh river and eventually into the Baram River, ending at Claudetown. The only way to get to that Kayan house was to paddle down the Sidam stream and thence on down the Melana which joined the Apoh river quite close to the house; this was roughly two days' journey. Unfortunately the Sidam was too dry to float the only sound boats, so there seemed to be nothing for it but to stay and wait till sufficient rain fell to make it rise. There was a path across country to the Melana, but that did not help because there was no means of reaching or communicating with the Kayan house some 6 hours further on down river without a boat. Eventually one of the Bruneis offered to try and take his small canoe, which would just hold himself and one companion, down the Sidam and Melana to call the Kayans up to fetch us, if we would walk across to the Melana and wait for them there. The Kalabits were none too pleased over this as they thought their part of conveying my things was finished, however I had to take some of them on and we persuaded three wandering Penans to help. A little party of six of these strange people arrived in the evening, a very old couple, a young man and girl and two children; clothing as usual of the scantiest nature, the women in just a short skirt and the men with chawats (loin cloths). Their pale skins contrasted strongly with those of the brown Kalabits, Muruts and Dayaks. They seemed very shy and a little frightened at having run into such a large party. I understood from Belulok that a Penan had lately shot a Kayan with a poisoned dart and that consequently all the Penans of this district were rather fearing a wholesale revenge. However we reassured them and the old couple and the young ma\nagreed to come with me to-morrow, not that the two former are likely to be of any use as carriers, but they are curious, never having seen a white man before, and wish to do the journey to the Melana with us; also I think the young man would not come without them. Belulok understands their language, but few of the Kalabits do. They excite a certain amount of admiration on the part of the Kalabits on account of their hard life, wandering for ever homeless in the jungle, depending on jungle produce alone for their sustenance. The wild sago palm is their chief support to which they add anything they can gain with their blow-pipe. They wouldn't come up into our huts but stood quietly outside in the rain, with their loads on their backs, making arrangements for to-morrow. I served out cigarettes and biscuits which were received with a slow smile of thanks. The phrase \"Thank you,\" by the way, seems unknown among all Sarawak natives, and any gift or service is always received in silence, but this by no means implies rudeness or ingratitude, although it looks so like it to a European. In spite of the rain and approach of night our nomad friends refused to share our huts and moved off into the jungle to some favoured spot of their own, promising to be with us again for an early start to-morrow morning.\n\nAmong our Kalabit bearers is a well-built young man, the slave of one of the up-river chiefs. Unhappily he is both deaf and dumb, but in spite of this terrible infliction seems wonderfully quick to understand and make himself understood. His friends always seemed sympathetically attentive to his wants, although he was well able to look after himself.\n\nJune 11th. We take leave of the Bruneis and set off across the Sidam under the leadership of a fat Kalabit, one Metaribu, a pleasant, though somewhat happy-go-lucky, casual gentleman, who says he thinks he knows the way having done the journey once before some three years ago. The others do not seem to think anything of trusting themselves to his guidance, though I express my doubts as to his ability to remember it after such a long time. Belulok laughs scornfully, \"of course he knows the path, if he has been along it once;\" and somehow Metaribu brings us through, now along a winding pig-track, now down some dried water-course, up another, across a succession of short steep hills, across one stream and down another, in and out of a maze of jungle and eventually late in the evening down to the banks of the Melana. As its name implies it was the blackest river we have come across so far, in great contrast to the beautiful clear waters of the mountain streams we passed from the Madihit to Batu Lawi. I asked Belulok if he knew the meaning of the name Melana, but he did not know nor was he able to give me a clue to the native Professor of Greek who (presumably) had named it thus. We passed several shelters used by other Penans evidently quite recently, we all enjoyed a refreshing bathe in the black waters of the Melana, except the Penans, who, true to Belulok's description of them some\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nweeks ago, never washed except in the rain. Built our lanchos on the left bank and slept the sleep of the just after a tiring day's walk, undisturbed by countless sandflies and mosquitoes.\n\nJune 12th. After an early breakfast we continue the walk with the idea of cutting across two large bends of the river and joining it again some way lower down at a place called Kuala Leppu Penyu. A little over two hours walk sufficed to bring us to that point and we sat down on a pebbly beach by the river side to wait for the Kayans fetched by the two Bruneis. The Penans want to return so I pay them off with three fathoms of black cloth (enough for one chawat), 4 cigarettes each and some salt. My stock of tobacco ran out some days ago. The young Penan showed us how to use the sumpitan (blow-pipe), kneeling on one knee and slightly leaning forward as he shot at some flowers in a tree some height above us. He had some 400 thin rotan rings on his legs and arms, many ornamented with three or four small beads. He gave me 5 as a keepsake; then they set off, after mutual expressions of friendship and goodwill duly interpreted by Belulok, and quickly disappeared into the depths of their jungle home.\n\nThe sun steadily rose and in spite of a refreshing bathe in the river it became excessively hot sitting waiting on the bank. I watched with interest some of our Kalabits squatting on the ground busily engaged in going over one another's heads for fleas! Very like monkeys in this work, although they kept their mouths still instead of exercising them in the chattering movement of monkeys. Any 'game' collected was solemnly handed over to the owner of the 'preserve,' who promptly bit it but did not swallow it. I chaffed Belulok on being found to be the owner of four. He laughed, and asked what could one expect after living in Kalabit houses like we had on and off for the last ten days? ! Certainly I couldn't blame him, having pleasant memories myself of those nights in Penribut's house, with rats gnawing at one's feet, dogs and fowls crawling over one, not to mention a continual irritation from bugs and fleas!\n\nAfter an hour or so we were rejoiced to see a small boat being poled up to meet us by three men; they turned out to be Kayans coming up to fish, and they reported having passed the Bruneis a little way lower down, so we mush have reached this place only just after the Bruneis had passed. We begged some tobacco off these three first, and then sent them off to fetch their companions, some of whom were fishing a little way off, while two others were hunting deer with the assistance of a small pack of pariahs. About one o'clock they arrived with two more small canoes and we squeezed our little party in and paddled on gently down the Melana, occasionally stopping to pull the boats over a small rapid. Some four hours later we reached the Apoh river and landed at a long Kayan house on the left bank of the Apoh, a shot distance above the entrance to the Melana. We are cordially welcomed by the chief, a fine broad-chested Kayan, Buoy Won by name, who leads us up\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 63, 1912.\nto a Chinaman's house close by, apologizing profusely for not being able to receive us properly as his own house is *pantang* (taboo) owing to the planting season. He tells me that I was extremely lucky to fall in with his men up-river to-day as this is the first day for a month that they have been allowed out, the taboo being nearly over. We ask the Chinaman if he has heard of any steamer coming to Claudetown and he tells us one arrived twelve days ago and that they were expecting another in three or four days time, so with any luck we ought to just get down in time to catch it.\n\nMt. Molu lies to the north-east of us and we had a fine view of it across a comparatively flat piece of country, stretching away at the back of the Chinaman's house. This is the first time we have had any view at all since leaving Penribut's house; the jungle invariably preventing all possibility of seeing any distance, although the lower part of the Melana showed more open country with mud banks along the water's edge instead of rocks and narrow gorges.\n\nBuoy Won explained how it was impossible for him to supply me with boat and crew for the journey on down river to-morrow owing to his house being *pantang*, but that he would be very pleased to do so if I wouldn't mind waiting two more days, so that he could spend one looking for an omen and another day to wait after having obtained it (as that was their custom), and then we could start on the third. However I thought that delay would probably make us miss the steamer, so we decided to send for a crew from another long house an hour or two down-river. Belulok, the chief of these people\u2014a Sebop tribe, Long Watts, as they are called, arrived a little after midnight in pouring rain; and Buoy Won came in too; most of my party had been asleep for some time, but we got up and dispensed gin and tobacco, and then discussed the important question of getting off to-morrow; apparently the Long Watts had a small taboo on too, however Buoy Won, anxious to get rid of me, emphasized my importance as a Government official and explained how necessary it was to help me in any way possible, so we at last turned in again about 2 a.m., the Long Watts having promised to have a boat and crew ready if Buoy Won's people would paddle me down to their house at daylight.\n\nMr. Douglas, the resident in charge of this large district, makes it clearly understood that anything to do with Government has to be attended to promptly, regardless of dreams, omens or taboos; although, as Buoy Won told me, he always takes care to ask if such and such a date and month will suit the natives, before arranging any big expedition which would require a lot of men. In this way, letters, verbal messages, or single travellers like myself with but five natives, get passed on from house to house like hot cakes, passed on from house to house like hot cakes.\n\nJune 13th. Buoy Won insisted on supplying us with rice for our journey, obtaining it from the Chinaman whom he promised to pay later. Although he had plenty in his own house, the taboo did\nnot allow him to give us any, nor for the same reason could I or any other stranger go up into his house. This by the way was an exceptionally long one, consisting of some ninety doors built some thirty yards back from the bank of the river. Large wooden tiles were used for the roof and the large solid bilian posts supporting the house were of a very different nature to the flimsy structures made by the Kalabits on the Madihit.\n\nAn hour's paddling brought us to Belulok's house and I went up to talk to him while they were preparing the boat. This is another long house built on the same solid lines as Buoy Won's. Belulok asked one of our party for some small present which as far as I could understand, he wanted as a kind of propitiatory offering for having caused the Long Watts to break through their taboo. He said it did not matter what form the offering took, only it must not be broken or damaged in any way; so one of my party offered a parang which seemed to meet the requirements of the case all right. The old chief apologized courteously for having asked for it, but explained that it was their custom under the circumstances, and the natives with me seemed to regard it as a natural request. We started off after a short delay, in their best racing boat, a fine long boat some 70 feet long with 18 Long Watts for a crew. When we were in, baggage and all, there was a bare inch of free board, but she was beautifully steady and the long gliding motion as they steadily paddled us down the Apoh was delightful. We stopped about one o'clock for a meal on the bank, and then continued till dark. We had to stop then, as it was too dangerous to try and shoot the rapids in the dark, although there were none very bad to pass. About nine the moon rose over the tree-tops by the water's edge and we were soon on the move again, reaching a long house at Batu Bla just at break of day. We are now in the Tutau river again, which, it may be remembered, is the same river that we ascended behind Mt. Molu up to Long Mutan.\n\nJune 14th. Most of the inhabitants of this long house were away and it was with some difficulty that the chief managed to get a boat for us to continue the journey. Our friends the Long Watts began the return journey up-river after resting an hour or so only. We had taken eighteen hours to come down and they expected to get back in two nights.\n\nWe spent a tedious day being passed on from house to house, doing an hour's journey with some Long Kiputs, then another stretch of two or three hours in a Bukit boat. By nightfall we had reached the main Baram river and later passed the mouth of the Tinjar river.\n\nJune 15th. 2.30 a.m. we draw up alongside the wharf of Claudetown; our first thought is for the steamer from Kuching, has she come and gone, or not yet arrived? We are told that it is all right, the last one left a fortnight ago and they are expecting another in any day now. After a few hours sleep in the Fort I pay an early call on Mr. H. S. B. Johnson, the Acting Resident in\ncharge of the station and realize the pleasure of meeting a European once more and talking English again after forty days wandering, with natives only for companions. The ordinary common-places of civilization all appear unusually attractive; sitting on a chair to a meal laid out on a table! Having a bed to sleep in! Vegetables, bread, butter, etc., to eat!! European papers to read\u2014true they are six weeks old, but still new to me! It is quite curious to feel such appreciation for what one is accustomed to regard more or less as the necessities of life.\n\nJuly 13th. After a pleasant, peaceful four weeks spent here enjoying the kind hospitality of Mr. Johnson, the daily expected steamer has at last arrived and we are to sail for Kuching tomorrow.\n\nJuly 14th. Left at 11 a.m. and reached the mouth of the Baram river that evening; there is rather a swell on outside and it is doubtful whether we can get over the bar to-morrow; we go ashore and enjoy a refreshing bathe in the sea, then climb to the top of the light-house in time to watch a magnificent sunset.\n\nJuly 15th. Too rough to get out at high tide this morning, so we have to put off all hopes of leaving till to-morrow. The bar of this river is particularly shallow, so that during the north-east monsoon no steamer can get in at all; even in the fine months of the year the steamers often have to wait for several days before getting in or out; once a whole month was spent by a steamer waiting patiently outside for a calm day to get in to the river!\n\nJuly 16th. Safely over the bar this morning, and the sea nice and calm, promising a fair passage to Kuching which we should reach in 36 hours.\n\nJuly 17th. Arrived in Kuching shortly after midday after an absence of two months and a half. The collectors had arrived from Limbang some ten days before. They had had a quick passage down the Limbang and had been able to spend five days collecting at the kuala Salindong. Then they had finished the journey on down to the Government station at Limbang and after a week's wait there had caught a steamer for Kuching arriving some ten days before us.\n\nConcluding Note.\n\nPerhaps a word of apology for the length of my narrative is due to the reader who has had the patience to follow me thus far, since after all, the journey described was certainly of less interest than many others of a similar nature accomplished every year by Europeans among uncivilized tribes in various parts of the world, and the necessary details could no doubt have been confined to a tenth part of the space now occupied by my narrative. I have not tried to condense it this manner for two reasons principally:\u2014(i) because I believe that the only way in which our knowledge of\nstrange natives and their ways of life can be materially increased by the constant publication of a large number of apparently trifling observations collected by men who have spent many years among natives, by men who know their language, their customs to a certain extent, and more important, by men who know the natives sufficiently well to be able to attach a fairly correct value to information received from them. And here let me at once hasten to deny all claim for myself to be in such a position so that my observations on native life are of any real importance. My excuse for appearing to take up that position is that this Journal is probably read by men in the East more than by men in Europe, and my article will more than serve its purpose, if, after reading the small details of interest I have recorded, men of long experience in the East can be induced to publish the trustworthy records of their own travels and observations, which are of such infinitely higher value than the \"experiences\" published year by year by hurrying globe-trotters, for whom a week in one country is found sufficient to enable them to write a book thereon.\n\n(ii) The details of places and native houses, I have hoped will some day be of interest to others who may make a journey to that region. Sir Spenser St. John's book, which I carried with me, consulting it nearly every day I found most useful and interesting for that purpose. His map was particularly useful and trustworthy; I regret that mine, based on very limited observations, is no more than a very rough 'sketch map,' only difficult to indicate the journey accomplished.\n\nThe collections made were regrettably small, although in spite of that, surprisingly rich in new and rare species, which clearly indicates the interesting and little known nature of the fauna and flora of that region. The hurried character of the expedition may be understood by the following brief summary, which explains the lack of opportunity for any steady collecting. In the 40 days' journey from the Government station at Limbang to the Government station of Baram (Claudetown) 31 were spent in actual travelling; or to put it another way, we slept two consecutive nights in the same place on five occasions and once for three consecutive nights. The river journey occupied 10 days (excluding a day spent at the kuala Madalam and another at the kuala Madihit), the walk in the mountainous region occupied 12 days excluding three days spent at Penribut's house, one on Mt. Derian and one on Mt. Selingsud. My return journey to Baram took 4 days to walk and 5 days in boats.\n\nUnfortunately the Madihit district is very sparsely populated and for that reason we were unable to procure enough coolies to carry provisions sufficient for any length of time; between the Madihit (Penribut's house) and Batu Lawi there are no natives and we were away 13 days without seeing anyone except the members of our party. Again from the Murut house just above the kuala Madalam up to the kuala Madihit, there are also no houses and we were travelling the best part of four days without meeting\n\nR. A. Soc., No 63, 1912.\nanyone. On the return journey there was a similar large gap between the Mago and the Apoh rivers (5 days' journey) without any native habitations, except the temporary shelters occupied by the nomad Penans. If the district had been more populous it would have been possible to arrange for relays of coolies to follow us to Batu Lawi every week or so with fresh provisions, but as it was, the small Kalabit houses in the Madibit were barely sufficient to provide us with carriers for the bare journey to Batu Lawi and back.\n\nThe general health of the expedition was by no means good. In the mountainous region, the natives in their scanty clothing felt the cold considerably although they used to keep fires going all night; but this availed little in the continual dampness. Many developed fever and bad colds, while I had to treat stomach disorders, cuts and bruises very frequently. The shortage of food on the return journey was a further hardship. Nevertheless they bore their troubles well and usually managed to raise a laugh at some enlivening sally from poor, ever-cheerful Madu, my much regretted Land-Dayak boy. I was fortunate enough to keep in excellent health the whole time and thoroughly enjoyed the invigorating mountain air.\n\nI must not conclude without a word of recognition of one of the pleasantest and at the same time most instructive features of the whole expedition; that was the invariable welcome and courteous hospitality always extended to us at every house; and reflecting on the diversity of tribes we met, viz.\u2014Bruneis, Bisayas, Dayaks, Tabuns, Adangs, Kalabits, Penans, Kayans, Long Watts, Long Kiputs and Bukits, not forgetting some Chinese traders\u2014it speaks much for the wide-spread nature of good feeling among the natives of those districts towards the white man's rule in Sarawak. Long may it remain so!\nAPPENDIX I.\n\nSome Plants Collected on Mr. Moulton's expedition to Batu Lawi.\n\nBY H. N. RIDLEY, C.M.G., F.R.S., ETC.\n\nThe little collection sent by Mr. Moulton contains some plants of considerable interest. Notably perhaps the Rhododendrons. Borneo appears to be quite rich in these beautiful plants, of which the collection contains no less than seven; of these one is a Kinabalu species, *R. cuneifolium*, Stapf., and another is not distinguishable from *R. jasminiflorum*, Stapf., of the Malay Peninsula. The connection of this flora with that of Mt. Kinabalu is further evidenced by the presence of *Pentaphragma aurantiaca*, Stapf., previously only known also from that mountain. The remainder of the plants are typical mountain species of Borneo, except *Bauhinia Finlaysoniana*, Grah., a rather rare Malay Peninsula species.\n\n**Meliaceae.**\n\n1. *Aglaia laxiflora*, Miq.

Batu Lawi.\n\nBy Dr. J. J. Smith, Buitenzorg.\n\nSince Ridley published his enumeration of the Orchideae from Borneo, many new species have been described and several others only known from other parts of the Malayan region, have been added to its flora, but a somewhat satisfactory survey of the Orchid flora of the large island is still lacking. Every addition is to be regarded as a step forward.\n\nThe small but interesting collection made by Mr. J. C. Moulton on Mt. Batu Lawi consists of 18 numbers representing 17 species. It is to be regretted, that in no less than 7 species the flowers are in no state good enough to be described. Among the remainder, 7 well marked new species were found.\n\nThe genus Eria represents the bulk of the collection, containing 7 species of which 3 belong to the small section Aeridostachya.\n\nThe plant I take to be Eria cymbidiifolia, Ridl., has elongate, 15-20 cm. long, 3-4 leaved stems. The leaves are obliquely subacute or subobtuse, where as Ridley describes them as bilobed. In the flowers too the description does not entirely suit Mr. Moulton's plant. It is nearly related to E. cymbiformis, J. J. S., from Sumatra, which has, as a plant cultivated in the Buitenzorg Botanical gardens shows, very short 8-10 leaved stems and pubescent inflorescences and flowers. It belongs to the section Cymboglossum, as I think does E. longifolia, Hook. f., E. lawiensis, J. J. S., is a very inconspicuous plant of the Trichotosia section.\n\nCoelogynne is represented by 3 species, of which one without flowers. C. Moultonii, J. J. S., with very large bracts seems to be the most showy plant of the collection and is allied to C. Dayana, Rchb. f., C. gibbifera, J. J. S., is a member of the Longifoliace section.\n\nThe two Dendrobiums are both allied to D. crumenatum, Swartz, with very fugaceous flowers. D. lawiense, J. J. S., is well marked by the elongate lip.\n\nIt is rather remarkable, that the two species of Dendrochilum belong to the very few representatives of the section Platyclinis with an elongate rhizome.\n\nThe Phaius is very similar to Ph. callosus, Lindl., hitherto not yet recorded from Borneo. The lip is however more cuneate as in the Javanese specimens and the midlobe smaller. Perhaps it is another species.\n\nList of Species.\n\n1. Eria (Sect. Aeridostachya) sp.\n2. Eria (Sect.

The\nlip is contracted in the middle and has an obscurely 3 lobed\nmidlobe.\nAPPENDIX III.\n\nThe Ferns of the Batu Lawi Expedition.\n\nBy E. B. Copeland, Dean of the College of Agriculture, Los Baros.\n\nOf the fifteen species sent, four and probably five are new to science. Besides these, there is one which cannot be specifically determined and one which has never been collected except in Borneo; the others are all of sufficiently General distribution in the Malayan region so that they do not point in one direction more than in any other.\n\nThe most notable thing about the collection is the very large proportion of new species. The other striking thing about it is the strong representation of the genus *Plagiogyria*. So far as its species are known, the large majority come from further north than Borneo, and this might be taken as a sign that Batu Lawi with its high elevation has a striking representation of Philippine and more northern plants.\n\nThe determinations are as follows:\n\n1. *Polypodium heterocarpum*, (Bl.)

In color, and in some other details, like *A. atratum* (Christ sub Diplazio), but much more finely cut. The specimen sent is three fronds of which only one is in fruit, and it very sparingly; it is therefore probable that the species reaches a considerably larger size than is here indicated.\n\n5. *Balantium pilosum*, Copel., n. sp.\n\nStipite 20 cm. vel ultra alto, castaneo-purpureo, decidue hirsuto indeque asperulo; fronde 30 cm. alta, 15 cm. lata, subdeltoidea, quadripinnatifida, rhachibus ubique pilis rufo-castaneis densissime vestitis; pinnulis stipitatis, 3 cm. longis, deltoideis; pinnulisii infimis 8 mm. longis, 5 mm. latis, obli-\n\nR.

Moulton.\n\nThe number of mammals taken on the expedition was regrettably small owing to the impossibility of spending any length of time in one place so that collectors could go out with guns or set traps.\nOnly nine specimens were collected representing eight different species.\n\n1. *Macacus nemestrinus*, Linn.\n   \n   One male, rather darker than usual, from the Madihit, May. A common monkey in South Burma, Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo.\n\n2. *Semnopithecus hosei*, Thos.\n   \n   One female from Salindong, June. A species apparently confined to the Baram and Limbang districts. The type was taken at Niah on the Sarawak coast.\n\n3. *Viverra tangalunga*, Gray.\n   \n   One from Salindong, June. Common.\n\n4. *Tupaia montanus*, Thos.\n   \n   One example from Mt. Selinguid, alt. 4,500 ft. circ. Compared with three from Mt. Dulit, the median blackish band is not fully developed and the sides lack the rufous tint of adult specimens. Mr. H. C. Robinson kindly examined it and agrees in this identification.\n\n5. *Rhithrosciurus macrotis*, Gray.\n   \n   One example from the Madihit district. Found in low-lying districts in Sarawak up to some 2000 ft. Not recorded outside Borneo.\n\n6. *Sciurus prevostii*, Desm.\n   \n   One from Limbang, June. Typical dark-grey backed form. One of the commonest squirrels in Sarawak.\n\n7. *Sciurus notatus*, Bodd.\n   \n   One from Mt. Derian, alt. 4,500-5,000 ft. May\u2014and one from Limbang in June. The Mt. Derian specimen agrees best with some from Mt. Dulit, but has a darker tail than any from that locality; the black band on each side of the belly is wider than in any Dulit specimen in the Museum. The underneath is rich reddish like the Dulit form. The Limbang example agrees with those taken near Kuching. A common squirrel all over Sarawak.\n\n8. *Cervulus muntjac*, Zimm.\n   \n   A male from Salindong. Common.\n\nR. A. Soc., No 63, 1912.\nAPPENDIX V.\n\nBirds taken on the Batu Lawi Expedition.\n\nBy J. C. Moulton.\n\nForty six specimens representing thirty different species of Birds were taken altogether on the expedition. They fall naturally into two divisions, (i) species from Limbang and the lower waters of that river as far up as Kuala Saladong; nearly all of which are found commonly in Sarawak and for the most part are widely distributed over India, China and Malaya. (ii) species from the mountainous country south and east of the Madihit, taken at altitudes of 3000 to 5000 feet. These are mostly rare species previously recorded from Mts. Kina Balu or Dulit only. Twenty species may be referred to the first of these divisions and ten to the second. The latter number shows a relatively high proportion of interesting species considering the short time actually spent in collecting and there is no doubt that a longer stay in the mountainous region would have produced many more interesting species.\n\n1. Haematortyx sanguiniceps, Sharpe.\n\nA male and female, the latter doubly identified as this. Both shot on the same day 25.5.11. This rare partridge has been previously recorded from Mt. Kina Balu, Lawas Mts. and Mt. Dulit only.\n\n2. Rollulus roulroul, Scop.\n\nThree males and one female at Salindong, June. A common partridge in Sarawak with habitat extending over Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java and Borneo.\n\n3. Argusianus grayi, Elliott.\n\nOne male example of the Argus pheasant from Salindong, June, shot this species is confined to Borneo, though an allied species occurs in Siam, Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. We found the dancing ground of this species on the hill above Salindong and heard its curious cry frequently.\n\n4. Butreron capelli, Temm.\n\nFive examples of this pigeon from Kuala Madalam. It also occurs in Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Java; apparently not common in Sarawak.\n\n5. Carpophaga aenea, Linn.\n\nThree specimens of this common pigeon near Limbang. Widely distributed over India, China and Malaya.\n\n6. Ducula badia, Raffl.\n\nA single example from Salindong. This is a rare pigeon in Sarawak, and apparently only found in mountainous districts, eg., Mt. Kina Balu and Mt. Dulit.\n7. *Spilornis pallidus*, Wald.\n\nOne from Mt. Derian, alt. 4,500 ft. June 1st. This eagle is confined to Borneo.\n\n8. *Pandion haliaetus*, L.\n\nOne from Limbang, June. Although widely distributed, apparently rarely met with in Sarawak.\n\n9. *Polioaetus ichthyaetus*, Horsf.\n\nYoung form from Salindong, June. A widely distributed species.\n\n10. *Ninox scutulata*, Raffl.\n\nOne from Limbang, June. The species is found in South India and Malaya.\n\n11. *Psittinus incertus*, Shaw.\n\nOne example of this common parrot near Limbang, June. It occurs over Indo-Malaya.\n\n12. *Eurystomus orientalis*, Linn.\n\nOne from Limbang. Common in Sarawak and widely distributed. The closely allied *Eurystomus calonyx*, Sharpe, is much rarer.\n\n13. *Pelargopsis leucocephala*, Gm.\n\nOne from Limbang in June. A common king-fisher along some of the Sarawak rivers and apparently confined to Borneo.\n\n14. *Anorrhinus galeritus*, Temm.\n\nOne from Limbang in June. A common Horn-bill in Sarawak; also found in Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.\n\n15. *Hierococcyx fugax*, Horsf.\n\nOne young one from Limbang, June. This Cuckoo does not seem to be common in Sarawak. It also occurs in Sumatra, Java and the Philippines. Mr. H. C. Robinson kindly examined this for me and concurred in my identification.\n\n16. *Zanclostomus javanicus*, Horsf.\n\nTwo from Salindong in June. Common in Sarawak. Also occurs in Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Java.\n\n17. *Urococcyx microrhinus*, Berlep.\n\nOne from Salindong. A common species in Borneo. The closely allied *U. erythrognathus* comes from Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.\n\n18. *Calyptomena viridis*, Raffles.\n\nOne from Salindong, June. A common broadbill in Sarawak. The species is found in Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.\n\nR. 'V Soc., No. 63, 1912.\n19. *Calyptomena whiteheadi*, Sharpe.\n\nOne taken on Mt. Selinguid, near Batu Lawi alt. 4,700 ft., May 29th. Only known from the mountainous district of North West Borneo.\n\n20. *Eurylaemus ochromelas*, Raffles.\n\nOne from Kuala Madihit, May 17th. A common species in Sarawak and distributed over Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.\n\n21. *Cymborhynchus macrorhynchus*, Gm.\n\nTwo specimens from Limbang, June. A common bird in Sarawak; also found in Tenasserim and Siam.\n\n22. *Pitta granatina*, Temm.\n\nOne from the Kuala Madihit, May 17th. Fairly well distributed over Sarawak, not found outside Borneo.\n\n23. *Hemixus connectens*, Sharpe.\n\nOne from Mt. Derian (alt. 4-5000 ft.). This bulbul is only found in the mountains of Northern Borneo. There are eleven other examples in the Sarawak Museum from Mts. Kina Balu, Dulit, Penrissen; none from altitudes below 3,000 ft.\n\n24. *Garrulax schistochlamys*, Sharpe.\n\nTwo specimens of this Laughing-Thrush from Mt. Derian, 4700 ft., May 26th. Previously recorded from Mts. Kina Balu and Dulit only. Iris claret, eyelid light blue, legs and feet dark slate.\n\n25. *Allocotops calvus*, Sharpe.\n\nOne from Mt. Derian, 4,700 ft. May 26th. Previously known from Mts. Kina Balu and Dulit only.\n\n26. *Rhinocicla treacheri*, Sharpe.\n\nFour examples shot on Mt. Derian 4,700 ft. May 26th. Iris black-brown, eyelid yellow, beak orange, legs, feet and claws yellow. Murut and Kalabit name is \"marabbiar.\" Only recorded from N. W. Borneo (Kina Balu) before. The closely allied *R. mitrata*, M\u00fcll., occurs in Sumatra and the mountains of the Malay Peninsula.\n\n27. *Cittoncincla suavis*, Sel.\n\nOne specimen from Limbang, June. Fairly common in Sarawak; not found outside Borneo.\n\n28. *Oriolus hosei*, Sharpe.\n\nOne example of this rare Oriole from Mt. Turan, alt. circ. 4000 ft. Iris claret, beak red. Previously recorded from Mt. Dulit only.\n\n29. *Buchanga stimatops*, Sharpe.\n\nOne from Mt. Derian, alt. 4,700 ft. This Drongo has been found on Kina Balu and in Sumatra.\n30. *Platysmurus aterrimus*, Temm.\n\nOne specimen from Salindong, June. A common bird in Sarawak; not found outside Borneo, though an allied species occurs in Sumatra and another in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.\n\nAPPENDIX VI.\n\n**Butterflies taken on the Batu Lawi Expedition**\n\nBy J. C. Moulton.\n\nAt first sight the total of 113 different species recorded compares very favourably with other lists compiled on similar expeditions* and this was no doubt due to the diverse nature of the regions passed through, including as it did perhaps the two best kinds of country for butterfly-collecting, namely, (i) stony or sandy banks of rivers and small sunny streams bordered in each case with tall virgin jungle, (ii) cleared mountain-tops. In the former class one meets a great number of Papilios, Pierines and small Lycaenids, usually congregated together in crowds on wet patches of sand, on wet clothes drying in the sun, or on refuse. In the latter class of country we were fortunate enough to have one beautiful fine day on the top of Mt. Selinguid, alt. 4,250 ft. For the greater part of our land journey we were walking in deep dark jungle and usually in rain, so that the butterflies we saw then were remarkably few. The list might easily have been larger if examples of more common species had been taken, such as *Mycalesis*, *Erites*, *Elymnias*, *Amathusia*, *Neptis*, *Athyma*, *Adolias*, *Euthalia*, *Tranaecia*, etc., etc., but I have not included them as I did not know them well enough to identify specifically with any certainty in the field and so made no notes of their occurrence, although representatives of those genera were certainly seen.\n\nAs did the birds, so do the butterflies fall into two natural groups (i) common, widely distributed, typical Malayan species mostly taken on the river journey (Limbang to the Madihit) and (ii) rare mountain species taken on the land journey between the head-waters of the Madihit and Batu Lawi, alt. 2,000-5,600 ft. We may refer 75 to the former class and most of the remaining 38 to the latter. The comparatively large totals of 50 different Lycaenidae and 16 different Pierinae are perhaps worthy of comment, considering the short time spent in actual collecting, while the totals of 21 species of Nymphalidae and 14 Hesperidae can only be characterized as distinctly poor.\n\n---\n\n*In a month's collecting on Mt. Penrissen, Sarawak, Mr. Shelford recorded 56 different species of butterflies (Journ. S r. Br., Roy. Asiat. Soc. No. 35. pp. 29-36 1901)\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 63, 1912,\nThe geographical distribution of the species taken in the mountainous district primarily points to a close relation with the butterfly-fauna of Kina Balu and other mountains in Borneo, and as we should further expect, species found in the mountains of Sumatra were also taken. Of the more widely distributed species taken, several are found in the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Burma, Palawan, the Philippines, Java and India (perhaps the most occurring in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, and the least number in Java and India).\n\n**Nymphalidae.**\n\n1. *Ideopsis daos*, Boisd.\n\n   Madihit, May 16th, (and its mimic the Chalcosid moth, *Isbarta pieridoides*, H. S. taken on Mt. Selinguid, May 31st). This common Danaine is widely distributed over Indo-Malaya.\n\n2. *Danais aspasia*, Fab.\n\n   Madihit, May 16th. A common Danaine with wide distribution.\n\n3. *Danais crowleyi*, J. Weir.\n\n   Mt. Selinguid, alt. 4,850 ft. This species is only known from the mountains of Borneo and Mr. Shelford in his \"Butterflies of Borneo\" * only records it from Mts. Kina Balu and Penrissen. It has since been taken on Mt. Poe in Sarawak.\n\n4. *Euploea crameri*, Lucas.\n\n   Very common on the muddy banks of the Melana and Apoh Rivers, June. Not noticed on the Limbang River or in the mountain districts.\n\n5. *Euploea bremeri*, Feld.\n\n   One male taken on Mt. Selinguid, alt. 4,850 ft. May 31st. These last two species are widely distributed over the Indo-Malayan region.\n\n6. *Euploea scudderii*, Butler.\n\n   A male taken on June 4th, Ulu Madihit. The species is confined to Borneo, but not scarce.\n\n7. *Euploea diocletianus lowii*, Butl.\n\n   Common on the muddy banks of the Apoh and Melana Rivers flying with *E. crameri*.\n\n8. *Mycalesis anapita*, Moore.\n\n   Limbang. A very common species; also occurs in Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.\n\n---\n\n*Journ. Str. Br., Roy. Asiat. Soc. No. 41, 1904. p. 87.*\n9. *Thaumantis aliris*, Westw.\n\nA male between Mt. Derian and hill above Rapaw, alt. circ. 3,000 ft., June 2nd, and another at Salindong, June 10th. This species is confined to Borneo; flies low in thick jungle. Common on Mt. Matang and I have seen it feeding on a dead mammal on Mt. Serambu.\n\n10. *Cynthia erotota erotella*, Butl.\n\nCommon on the banks of the Limbang River. A widely distributed species.\n\n11. *Cirrochroa bajadeta*, Moore.\n\nSalindong. A common species, also occurring in the Malay Peninsula and Java.\n\n12. *Cirrochroa malaya calypso*, Wall.\n\nOne from Salindong. A common species, also occurring in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.\n\n13. *Adolias dirtea*, Fab.\n\nA female from Salindong, June 11th. Common and widely distributed species.\n\n14. *Cyrestis seminigra*, Gr. Sm.\n\nOne on Mt. Selinguid, alt. 4,850 ft., May 31st. A rare species, confined to Borneo, and principally to high altitudes.\n\n15. *Kallima inachis buxtoni*,\n\nSeen on two occasions, on the Limbang River. This subspecies, the Bornean representative of the celebrated Leaf-butterfly of the Indo-Malayan region, is rare in Sarawak. It seems less scarce at Limbang, and I have seen it on Mts. Serambu and Penrissen, but its strong flight and beautiful protective device render it very hard to capture.\n\n16. *Doleschallia bisaltide borneensis*, Fruhst.\n\nOne from Salindong, June 12th. A common species in Sarawak. *D. bisaltide* has a wide distribution over Indo-Malaya.\n\n17. *Eulepis delphis concha*, Vollenh.\n\nNear Kuala Delong, Limbang River, May 14th, and one at Madihit, May 16th. We also saw it on sunny places along the rocky banks of the Limbang, flying with the common Pierine, *Catopsilia crocale*, Cr. Its stronger flight at once distinguished it from that species.\n\n18. *Prothoe francki angelica*, Butl.\n\nMadibhit, May 16th. A common and widely distributed species.\n\n19. *Zemeros emesioides eso*, Fruhst.\n\nKuala Madalam, Limbang River, May 11th. The typical form occurs in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula.\n20. *Laxita orphna*, Boisd.\n\nA single female taken at the foot of Mt. Selinguid, alt. 2,700 ft., May 31st. This specimen differs from typical *orphna* in having a broader sub-apical band of red on the upperside of fore-wing which is developed at the expense of the fuscous in basal area. On the underside the irridescent spots are slightly less developed. A common species in Sarawak showing little variation.\n\n21. *Laxita telesia*, Hew.\n\nMadihit River, May 18th., and Salindong, June 11th. A common butterfly in Sarawak.\n\n**Fam.

Selinguid, 4,850 ft., May 31st.\n\n74. *Delias pandemia*, Wall.\n\nA male from Madihit, May 21st, and two females at Salindong June 10th and 11th. A local species, not rare in the Limbang district; I have also taken it at Lawas and Bintulu in Sarawak. Confined to Borneo.\n\n75. *Delias parthenia*, Staud.\n\nOne male from Madihit, alt. 2,000 ft., May 21st. A rare mountain species confined to Borneo.\n\n76. *Catopsilia crocale*, Cr.\n\nBoth seasonal forms were very common all the way up the Limbang and Madihit Rivers; of those captured there are three females of typical dry season form bearing the date May 14th, one female and five males of the typical wet season form bearing the dates May 14th and 16th.\n\n77. *Terias harina*, Horsf.\n\nA female on Mt.

It differs from the only other female in the Sarawak Museum in the internervular fuscous ground-colour on the underside of the hind-wing which shows light constrictions suggestive of an approach towards the *noctis* type in which this constriction has been carried out, resulting in a hind-marginal row of well defined spots. A typical female *noctis* was taken on the Limbang River in April 1910.\n\n91. *Papilio demolion*, Cr.\n\nSalindong, June 11th. A common butterfly in Sarawak.\n\n92. *Papilio iswara*, White.\n\nSalindong, June 12th.

Has a larger expanse of white on the upperside of hind-wing than in the typical form. Mr. Druce kindly determined it for me. A common species found in Sikkim, Malay Peninsula, Java and Palawan.\n\n101. *Hasora maestissima*, Mab.\n\nOne from Mt. Selinguid, alt. 4,850 ft., May 31st, which has two spots in fore-wing, and one specimen from the Limbang River near Kuala Delong, May 14th, which has no spots in the fore-wing. This latter insect was examined by Mr. Druce and provisionally referred to this species. Also recorded from Kina Balu, Palawan and Mindanao.\n\n102. *Hasora chuza*, Hew.\n\nTaken on or near mountain streams from the Madihit to Batu Lawi at altitudes ranging from 1000-5000 ft. Occurs in Burma and Java.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 63, 1912.\n103. *Bibasis uniformis*, Elwes.\n\nMadihit, May 16th.

Found in Java, Palawan and Luzon.\n\n104. *Rhopalocampta crawfurdii*, Dist.\n\nMadihit, June 5th. Usually found on the summit of Mt. Matang. Also occurs in the Malay Peninsula.\n\n105. *Ismene etelka*, Hew.\n\nSalindong, June 9th and 12th, and Madihit, May 15th. This species has been taken on Kina Balu and at Lawas; it is also recorded from Singapore.\n\n106. *Ismene harisa*, Moore.\n\nMadihit, alt. 2,000 ft., June 5th. A rare species in Sarawak. Recorded from Sikkim, Burma and Java.\n\n107. *Jambrix stellifer*, Butl.\n\nTwo examples from Limbang. Fairly common in Sarawak; also recorded from Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Java.\n\n108. *Scobura martini*, Elwes.\n\nOne specimen from Mt. Derian, alt. 4,500 ft., May 26th. The species is described from a single specimen in the Rothschild collection from the Batak Mts., Sumatra. From the literature available this Sarawak capture appears to be the first record of the species for Borneo and at the same time the second known specimen in existence.\n\n109. *Scobura umbrosa*, Elwes.\n\nA single example known from Salindong, June 11th; this species is described from two examples taken on Mt. Kina Balu. There appear to be no other records of it.\n\n110. *Koruthaiatos hector*, Wats.\n\nMadihit, May 20th. Widely distributed over Malaya.\n\n111. *Halpe gupta*, de Nic\u00e9v.\n\nA single example from Mt. Selinguid 4,850 ft., May 31st. Unfortunately in bad condition and doubtfully identified thus by Mr. Druce. Recorded from Sikkim only.\n\n112. *Pithauria aitchisoni*, Wd.-Msn.\n\nA single example taken at Kuala Madalam on the Limbang, May 11th. A rare species described from Kina Balu. Piepers records it from Java.\n\n113. *Kerana gemmifer*, Butl.\n\nOn the way down Mt. Derian to the rivers Kri, May 27th. Not rare in Sarawak.

Batu Lawi together with descriptions of supposed new species.\n\nBy F. F. Laidlaw, M.A., F.Z.S., etc.\n\nWith Plate.\n\nThe list given below adds several species to the known Bornean fauna and includes a high percentage of undescribed forms. It will be noticed that probably all the Agrioninae are new to science, a fact which enables one to realize how imperfect our knowledge of the dragonflies of the old world tropics still remains.\n\nConsequent on this it follows that the systematic arrangement of the Agrionine genera in particular is highly unsatisfactory, which is to be the more regretted in that these insects are no doubt capable of affording valuable clues for the elucidation of many problems of distribution. Carefully made collections from other parts of Borneo, from the Celebes, and Philippine Islands, especially from the mountains, no less than from other parts of the Malay Archipelago are much to be desired in order to amplify the researches of de Selys, Ris, Kruger, Martin, and others, who have devoted attention to the distribution of the Austro-Malayan Odonate fauna. I wish to offer my sincere thanks to Mr. Moulton for the time and trouble he has spent in making this collection and in putting it and much other valuable material in my hands for examination. I take the opportunity here also of recording my indebtedness to Dr. Ris and to M. Martin for the generous assistance they have so cordially extended to me at all times.\n\nLiterature. In addition to the volumes of the Catalogue of the \"Collections zoologiques du Baron Edm. de Selys Longchamps\" dealing with the Odonata, which have so far appeared, which Dr. Ris and M. Martin have compiled, the following papers of recent date have been consulted. For earlier papers dealing with the odonate fauna of the Malayan region reference should be made to the very full bibliography given by Kr\u00fcger in his studies on the Odonata of Sumatra.\n\nKr\u00fcger.

Appears to differ from *A. perampla*, Martin, which has been recorded from Borneo in its slightly larger size, and very narrow fork to Rs. Hind-wing in *A. perampla* \u2640 62 mm. long, in *A. grubaueri* \u2640 (present specimen) 70 mm. long. Also in *A. grubaueri* \u2640 the outer half of each wing has a yellow tinge in addition to the dark brown mark at the base, whilst the thorax is entirely rich brown anteriorly with a pair of yellow stripes on either side.\n\nJagoria modiglianii, Selys. 1\u2640 Mt. Selinguid, 4,800 ft. 31.5.11.\n\nLength of abdomen 45 mm. Length of hind-wing 44 mm.\n\nApproximates in size to Needham's *Dolaeschna elacatura* which is regarded by Dr. Ris as synonymous with the present species, as is also the smaller *Jagoria poeciloptera*, Karsch, or at least specimens from Singapore referred to that species.\n\nGomphinae.\n\nLeptogomphus williamsoni, sp. n. \u2642 adult. Locality Madilhit, alt. 2,000 ft.\n\nLength of abdomen with appendages 34 mm., hind-wing 25 mm.\n\nA single row of cells in the anal area of the fore-wing. A basal sub-costal nerve of the second series present in all four wings. Dorsal thoracic stripe isolated, yellow ante-humeral stripe present, complete. A pair of small lateral basal yellow spots on abdominal segments 3-7. Segments 8-10 black, with an oval yellow dorsal spot on 10. Legs black. 15 ante-nodals and 10 post-nodals on fore-wing. Upper lip black with yellow base; genae yellow; vertex brown, the rest of the upper surface of the head black.\n\nProthorax black with lateral yellow spot.\n\nThorax black above, variegated with yellow; yellow below.\n\nMesothoracic half-collar wedge-shaped, the base of the wedge lying close against the middle line, the dorsal stripe narrow; ante-humeral stripe continuous with the yellow of the undersurface. Anal appendages very dark brown. Upper pair laterally compressed, about equal in length to segment 10, ending in a sharp, upturned point, the outer border with 4 or 5 strong serrations, the most proximal of these being the largest, and forming a projecting tooth against which the termination of the lower appendage bites. Lower appendage equal in length to upper pair, its distal half forked so that it ends in two widely divaricated spurs. (See fig. 2).\n\nThis new species approaches *Microgomphus* in possessing but a single row of cells in the anal area of the fore-wing. If the species is correctly referred to *Leptogomphus*,\u2014and in so referring it I\nhave the support of Dr. Ris, a slight alteration becomes necessary in the definition of the genus proposed by Williamson, namely that the anal field of the front wing may consist of a single row, or of a maximum of two rows of cells.\n\n*Hylaeothemis clementia*, Ris. 1\u2640 Limbang.\n\nDescribed from a single male in the Selys collection. Length of abdomen \u2640 23 mm. \u2642 23 mm., hind-wing \u2640 27 mm. \u2642 25 mm.\n\nIn coloration the female is practically identical with the male described by Dr. Ris. The eighth abdominal segment has well developed lateral foliations. The ventral plate of this segment ends at the level of the end of the segment in a pair of blunt almost square projections one on either side of the middle line, with a median notch between them. The ventral plate of the ninth segment has posteriorly a slight median rounded projection which at its free margin is fringed with rather stout hairs some of which project downwards (see fig. 3). Except that segment 8 has well marked lateral expansions the arrangement of the terminal segments of the abdomen resembles very closely that figured by Dr. Ris for the African *Allorhizucha klingi*, Karsch. Ris remarks that the structure of the genital armature of the male *Hylaeothemis* allies it to the group of genera to which *Allorhizucha klingi* belongs. Mr. Moulton's specimen has only two nerves on the basal space of both hind wings and the supratriangular space of the right fore-wing is uncrossed.\n\n**Calopteryginae.**\n\n*Matronoides cyaneipennis*, F\u00f6rster.\n\nSix males of this magnificent insect were obtained by Mr. Moulton from a mountain torrent which flows between Mt. Selinguid and Batu Lawi at an altitude of about 3,800 ft. This is a new locality for the species hitherto recorded only I believe from Mt. Kina Balu. The single specimen belonging to the genus *Euphaea* is a female, and at present it is unfortunately impossible to determine the species of isolated females of that genus.\n\nThe *Rhinocypha* belongs to a species of which the description has not yet been published. Mr. Martin however, has already named and described specimens belonging to the same species, in his volume on the *Calopteryginae* of the de Selys collection, which is now in the press and shortly to be published. Accordingly I pass it over here.\n\n**Agrioninae.**\n\n*Coeliccia (Trichocnemis) nemoricola*, sp. n. 2\u2642 2\u2640. 27.5.11.\n\n\u2642. Length of abdomen 50 mm. Length of hind-wing 32 mm. Median sector rises from nodal vein. 19 post-nodal nerves in fore-wing. Pterostigma black. Wings iridescent.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 63, 1912.\nHead. Lower lip whitish-brown, upper surfaces entirely velvety-black.\n\nProthorax white below, above black with indications of a paler mark on either side.\n\nThorax white below, above and on the sides velvety black. There is an indication of a narrow antehumeral stripe on either side, of a dull black purple colour, and of a band of similar colour at the base of the side of the thorax. During life it is possible that these bands are of a brighter colour.\n\nAbdomen entirely dull black (in one specimen there is some trace of lighter colour on the dorsal side of segment 10) except for the sides and under surface of the first and second segments which are brownish-white.\n\nLegs, anterior surface of femora and tibias white, dorsal surfaces black, spines and tarsi black.\n\nAnal appendages black, very similar in shape and proportions to those of C. octogesima. Upper pair \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) as long as lower pair, rather stout, finger-shaped, flattened from side to side, with a small inwardly and downwardly directed tooth at about the middle of their length on the under side. Lower pair slender cylindrical, ending in a sickle-like curve, their extremities turned almost directly inwards to meet each other.\n\nThis species rivals in size C. orang F\u00f6rster from the Malay Peninsula, and with it stands as the largest described species of the genus. It is further characterized by its very sombre coloration, as well as by the shape of the anal appendages.\n\nAmphicnemis remiger, n. sp. 1\u2642 Kuala Madalam, Limbang River, Sarawak. 11.5.11.\n\nLength of abdomen 34 mm. Length of hind-wing 19 mm.\n\nUpper lip metallic bronze-green, the whole of the upper surface of the head greenish-black.\n\nProthorax metallic bronze-green above, pale yellow below. The posterior margin of the prothorax is produced on either side into a sharply projecting angle, but there is no median spine.\n\nThe thorax is metallic bronze-green above; this colour ends sharply immediately beyond the first lateral suture, where it is succeeded by the pale primrose yellow of the sides and under surface.\n\nThe abdomen has (as in other species) the dorsal surface of the first two segments of a metallic green colour. The remaining segments are dull brown above, paler beneath, the last four segments almost uniformly dull brownish black.\n\nLegs primrose yellow, with a fine black ring at each articulation.\n\nAnal appendages white (see fig. 4). Upper pair slender, ending in a disc so that they have rather a paddle-like shape. The shaft a little bowed with a small dorsal tooth at its middle. Lower\npair rather shorter, slender, ending in an upturned point. (See fig. I).\n\nWings with 11 post-nodal nerves on the anterior pair.\n\nPterostigmata grey with whitish margin, the upper border decidedly shorter than the lower.\n\nPerhaps nearest to *A. furcata*, Brauer, but decidedly smaller, with short lateral angles to the prothorax. Those of *A. furcata* are described as long, thin, cylindrical points.\n\n**Teinobasis rajah**, sp. n. 2\u2642\u2642 Limbang. 22.6.11.\n\nLength of abdomen 33 mm. Length of hind-wing 20 mm.\n\nPterostigma gray with pale margin, oblong and a little oblique; not quite covering one cell. 13 post-cubital nervules.\n\nUpper side of quadrilateral having in the fore-wing two-fifths, and in the hind-wing three-fifths of the length of the lower side. Wings petiolated to the basal post-costal nerve, which lies almost at the level of the second antenodal. Colour orange-red and bronze-green above, whitish yellow below.\n\nHead:\u2014Lower lip, whitish-yellow, with long lobes. Upper lip, orange with black lateral border. The rest of the head dark bronze-green, with a narrow orange line across the nasus.\n\nProthorax:\u2014Orange-red above, paler below.\n\nThorax:\u2014Rich orange-red above, paler at the sides and below, with a fine bronze-green median longitudinal stripe.\n\nAbdomen:\u2014Segments 1-7 dull brown, 8-10 orange red. The three last segments a little stouter than the first seven, which are very slender.\n\nLegs yellow, with brownish-black spines.\n\nAnal appendages reddish-brown; darker at their extremities.\n\nUpper pair very small, cylindrical, curved inwards at their extremities, with a small inwardly directed spur.\n\nLower pair of the same length, flattened from side to side, directed backwards and upwards; ending in a fine black point.\n\n**Pseudagrion (?) dubium**, sp. n. 1\u2642. 27.5.11.\n\nLength of abdomen 40 mm. Length of hind-wing 27.5 mm.\n\nWings petiolated to basal post-costal nerve, which lies at the commencement of the distal third of its distance between the first and second antenodal nerve. Arculus at the level of the second antenodal nerve.\n\nQuadrilateral rather long, its upper side in the fore-wing two-thirds, and in the hind-wing three-quarters of the length of its lower side. Median sector rising beyond level of vein descending from nodus.\n\nPterostigma small, black, oblique.\n\nHead, small. Lower lip white. Upper surface entirely black (there is a faint indication in the single specimen of a pair of post-ocular marks which appear to be very slight depressions with a bright light reflex; possibly due to post-mortem shrinkage).\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 63, 1912.\nProthorax and thorax rich blackish-brown above, pale below. Laterally the thorax is paler brown, with an obscure blue-grey humeral stripe.\n\nAbdomen slender, entirely brownish-black, with indications of paler marking on the dorsum of segments 8 to 9.\n\nLegs yellow, with black articulations and a brown longitudinal stripe on the dorsal side of the femora.\n\nAnal appendages brownish black, the upper pair conical, directed backwards, the lower pair running backwards and upwards, narrower and more pointed than upper pair, both pairs shorter than segment 10 (see fig. 5).\n\nDr. Ris has examined the specimen and has kindly furnished me with the following notes on it. \"It is not a Teinobasis as it has toothed claws and simple superior appendages; also evidence of post-ocular spots. The general form, the position of M 3 and RS, as well as the character of the superior appendages forbid its being referred to Pseudagrion without some stress to the definition of the genus. In the absence of the \u2640 the position of the specimen must remain doubtful. I have nothing to compare exactly with it, not even Pseudagrion magnanimum from the Aru Islands which also is not a Pseudagrion, but I think generally distinct from the present specimen.\"\n\nDisparoneura moulloni, sp. n. 1\u2642. 11.5.11.\n\nLength of abdomen 34 mm. Length of hind-wing 19 mm.\n\nHead.\u2014Upper lip pale yellow, with fine black margin; the rest of the upper surface of the head velvety black.\n\nProthorax.\u2014Upper surface black, under side yellowish-white.\n\nThorax. Dorsal and lateral surfaces black, with a fine yellow lateral stripe, under surface yellowish-white.\n\nAbdomen. Brownish-black, a yellow mark on either side of the second segment, and the under surface of segments 1 and 2 also yellow.\n\nLegs. Brownish-black.\n\nAnal appendages small, about equal in length to the 10th segment. Upper pair seen from above leaf shaped, pale yellow above, edged with brownish black. Each has a small projection inwards. Lower pair brownish-black, cylindrical, sharply curved inward at their extremities: about equal in length to upper pair.\n\nWings. Pterostigma brownish-black, very oblique, lying over one and one third cells. Basal post-costal nerve lying between the level of the costal antenodal nerve. No rudiment of lower sector of triangle. (Cu 2). 14 post-costal nerves in fore-wing.\n\nUpper sector of quadrilateral reaching to the first cross nerve after the quadrilateral in the fore-wing and to the second in the hind-wing.\n\nThis species belongs to the group which includes species referred by Selys to the genus Caconeura (Alloneura) viz: C. dor-\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nsalis, gracillima, lansbergi, and hyperythra, as well as C. dohrni of Kruger.\n\nDr. Ris has most courteously permitted me to use a suggestion of his as to the definition of the genera Disparoneura and Caconeura (Alloneura) which I have followed in referring the species described above to Disparoneura, involving a change in the definition of the genus which will necessitate the transfer of all the species mentioned above from Caconeura to Disparoneura. He proposes to distinguish the genera as follows:\n\n(a) Basal post-costal nerve placed in a level with the first antenodal or even proximal to it; no rudiment of Cu 2 (lower sector of triangle) = Caconeura.\n\n(b) Basal post-costal nerve placed at a level between antenodal 1 and 2, mostly about half-way; rudiment of Cu 2 present or absent = Disparoneura.\n\nHe points out that the rudiment of Cu 2 seems to be individually and even asymmetrically variable in some species.\n\nConsequently I refer the present species to Disparoneura in the neighbourhood of the group of species named above.\nAPPENDIX IX.\n\nSome words in use among the natives met on the journey to Batu Lawi.\n\nBy J.
