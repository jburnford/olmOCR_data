It forms, however, in many respects a close parallel to, and commentary on, the Aitareya \u0100ra\u1e47yaka, and I have thought it desirable to complete my edition and translation of that work by a literal rendering of the \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana \u0100ra\u1e47yaka.\n\nI am aware that in several places my version is unsatisfactory, and I should have preferred if I could have found it possible to obtain further manuscript material for the constitution of the text of Adhy\u0101yas vii\u2013xv. But I am inclined to think that it is important in Sanskrit studies to observe some proportion between the effort expended and the value of the result, and I trust that this translation will afford students of the Veda a means of seeing, with the least expenditure of time and trouble, exactly what the \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana \u0100ra\u1e47yaka contains. A full comparison with the Aitareya \u0100ra\u1e47yaka will be found in my edition of the latter work, in the Indexes to which I have included the lexicographical and other matter of the \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana so fully as to render an Index to this translation needless.\n\nI have added, as of more general interest, an Appendix on the Mah\u0101vrata rite. This paper was prepared for the recent\nmeeting of the Congress of Religions at Oxford, which I was unavoidably prevented from attending, but at which Professor Macdonell very kindly read an abstract of the paper.\n\nI have to express my heartiest thanks to the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society for accepting this translation for their series, and to Miss Hughes for the great trouble she has been so good as to take to secure its satisfactory production and to remove errors. Professor Eggeling, under whom I commenced to learn Sanskrit, has done me the honour of reading a proof and of making suggestions which I have been only too glad to accept.\n\nA. BERRIEDALE KEITH.\n\nLondon, September, 1908.\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nThe Mah\u0101vrata in the form described in the \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana \u0100ra\u1e47yaka is the ceremonial performed on the second last day of the Gav\u0101mayana Sattr\u0101, a sacrifice extending over a year and symbolic of the year. As a form of the Agni\u1e63\u1e6doma the ritual feature of the day is its division into three parts, the morning, midday, and evening pressings of the Soma and their accompanying Stotras of the S\u0101man singers and \u015aastras of the Hot\u1e5bs. The \u015aastras alone are systematically dealt with in the \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana \u0100ra\u1e47yaka, though mention is made also of the corresponding Stotras. In the morning pressing there correspond to the Bahispavam\u0101na and to four Ajya Stotras the Ajya and Pra\u016bga \u015aastras of the Hot\u1e5b and three Ajya \u015aastras of the Hotrakas. In the midday pressing there correspond to the M\u0101dhyandinapavam\u0101na Stotra and four Pr\u1e63\u1e6dha Stotras the Marutvatiya and Ni\u1e63kevalya Sastras of the Hot\u1e5b and three Ni\u1e63kevalya \u015aastras of the Hotrakas. In the evening pressing there correspond to the \u0100rbhavapavam\u0101na Stotra and the Yaj\u00f1\u0101yaj\u00f1iya S\u0101man the Vai\u015bvadeva and \u0100gnim\u0101ruta \u015aastras.\n\nThese \u015aastras receive, however, very different shares of the attention of the writer of the \u0100ra\u1e47yaka, i and ii. After an introduction (i, 1) he devotes a single chapter to the Ajya and Pra\u016bga \u015aastras (i, 2), and one to the Marutvatiya \u015aastra (i, 3). He then describes and explains the ceremonies preceding immediately the Ni\u1e63kevalya \u015aastra or Mahad Uktha, which forms the essential and highest part of the ritual, commencing with the oblations of ghee (i, 4; 5), interpolating a legend of Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra (i, 6), and concluding with the ceremonial of the mounting of the swing (i, 7; 8), which symbolizes the sun. The Mahad Uktha itself, in its full\ndetail, occupies nearly all the second book (ii, 1-17), and a concluding chapter (ii, 18) deals with the Vai\u015bvadeva and \u0100gnim\u0101ruta S\u0101stras.\n\nThe \u0100ra\u1e47yaka does not go into any detailed explanation of the ceremonies alluded to in i, 4; 5; 7; 8, and to understand the allusions it is necessary to refer to \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana \u015arauta S\u016btra, xvii and xviii, of which a brief summary follows.\n\nPreparations for the ceremony are commenced some days before it begins. For making a swing for the Hot\u1e5b there are brought together two or three planks, preferably of Udumbara wood, an arm\\(^1\\) thick, an ell long, pierced at the corners; also two forked poles of over a man\u2019s height, a cross-bar and strong cords of Mu\u00f1ja grass, more than two fathoms long. For the Udg\u0101\u1e6d\u1e5b\u2019s seat Mu\u00f1ja or Darbha grass is used, and the feet are a span high, the other parts an ell. The Adhvaryu is given a bundle of Mu\u00f1ja or Ku\u1e63a grass, on which he stands and makes his responses. The other priests have only b\u1e5bs\u012bs (mats) a span high. A lute with a hundred strings is got ready, the body of Pal\u0101\u015ba, the handle of Udumbara wood, or vice versa; it is covered with a red ox-hide, hairy side upmost, and as bow a naturally crooked reed with leaves is used. For the maidens who are to dance water-jugs are provided, and there is a variety of musical instruments\\(^2\\) which are merely names to us. There are also four or six drums, two within and two without the Sadas. A horse and chariot are ready and a bow and three arrows for use by a king or other distinguished archer. The target consists of an entirely round skin hung up between two posts to the left of the \u0100gn\u012bdhra. Behind the \u0100gn\u012bdhra a hole is dug and covered with the skin of the sacrificial animal, which serves as the so-called \u2018earth-drum,\u2019 which is beaten with the tail of the sacrificial animal. The presence of a \u015a\u016bdra woman and an \u0100ryan \u2018bald head\u2019 is mentioned as antiquated and obsolete.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) None of these measures can be fixed with certainty; cf. Hopkins on Epic Measures, *J.A.O.S.*, xxiii, 147 seq.; *Z.D.M.G.*, lvi, 347.\n\n\\(^2\\) Avaghatarik\u0101, al\u0101buv\u012b\u1e47\u0101, gh\u0101\u1e6dakarkari, godh\u0101vin\u0101k\u0101, k\u0101ndav\u012bn\u0101, picchor\u0101, etc. Cf. the list in S\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s comm. on Aitareya \u0100ra\u1e47yaka, v, 1, 5, quoted from \u0100pastamba.\n\n\\(^3\\) \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana \u015arauta S\u016btra, xvii, 1-6.\nIn the evening before the rite begins, as usual, the place of the sacrifice is swept, fresh grass strewed, etc., and at night begins the Pr\u0101taranuv\u0101ka litany, which has to be composed of a full thousand verses. An animal sacrifice is performed, either of one beast for Indra and Agni or of eleven,\\(^1\\) and in addition the beasts mentioned in the \u0100ranyakas, i, 1. The utensils are, after the sacrifice is completed, carefully washed outside the Vedi and brought within the Sadas after the Samprasarp\u0101na, or \u2018gliding in,\u2019 of the celebrants is completed. No peculiarities occur in the ritual which follows the Agnistoma\\(^2\\) until after the Marutvatiya \u015aastra,\\(^3\\) or just after the ending of the morning pressing, when the setting up of the swing takes place. Holes\\(^4\\) have to be dug, and the side-posts and the cross-bars are carpentered. The cross-beam is placed as high as the Hot\u1e5b\u2019s forehead, or, if he is small, extended arms. The posts are rammed hard into the ground, and made secure by pressing in twigs, etc., and the swing seat is fastened firmly with the ropes, so as to be a span above the earth. Grass is strewed under it, and the right side may be a little elevated.\n\nAfter the M\u0101hendragrahas have been drawn off, the Adhvaryu goes in front of the Hot\u1e5b\u2019s altar, and the Hot\u1e5b then addresses to him the Prai\u1e63a, \u2018Adhvaryu, now cease.\u2019 Then the Hot\u1e5b leaves the Sadas, goes round the \u0100gn\u012bdhra\u2019s altar, and, bending the right knee, takes with a ladle of Udumbara wood eight libations of ghee (i, 4), which he offers to the accompaniment of a Mantra apiece. He puts down the ladle, and, leaving the vicinity of the \u0100gn\u012bdhra, stands in front of the Sadas\\(^5\\) to the north of the Sruti, facing the east, and mutters the Parim\u0101ds (i, 4; 5). Then\\(^6\\) he pays reverence to the fire altar\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana \u015arauta S\u016btra, xvii, 7, 7.\n\n\\(^2\\) Now most fully and admirably described by Caland & Henry, L\u2019Agnistoma, Paris, 1906, 1907.\n\n\\(^3\\) For the morning \u015aastras and the Marutvatiya, see \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana, xvii, 8; 9.\n\n\\(^4\\) Ibid., xvii, 10\u201312, 5.\n\n\\(^5\\) See plan in Eggeling, S.B.E., xxvi, followed in L\u2019Agnistoma.\n\n\\(^6\\) \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana \u015arauta S\u016btra, xvii, 12, 6\u201315, 12. Other accounts of the ritual are given in L\u0101\u1e6dy\u0101yana \u015arauta S\u016btra, iii, 10\u2013iv, 3; K\u0101ty\u0101yana \u015arauta S\u016btra, xiii, 3; T\u0101ndya Mah\u0101br\u0101hma\u1e47a, v, 5, 6; Taittir\u012bya Samhit\u0101, vii, 5, 9; 10; Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, i, 2, 6, 7; Aitareya \u0100ranyakas, v. See Hillebrandt, Rom. Forsch., v, 299 seq.; below, pp. 73 seq.\nin its several parts, and to the sun while in the sacrificial hut (i, 5). The Hot\u1e5b then retires into the Sadas, goes behind the swing which is there, and takes hold of it, not again to let it go until he has mounted on and descended from it. He gives to the Adhvaryu instructions as to the exact mode of making responses, and to the Prastot\u1e5b as to leaving out seven Stotriyas. The Adhvaryu begins the Mah\u0101vrata S\u0101man, the Udg\u0101\u1e6d\u1e5b mounts his Udumbara stool, and the other priests sit on their mats. The Udg\u0101\u1e6d\u1e5b beats the big lute and the women their lutes. The drums, including the 'earth-drum' are beaten, and loud cries raised. Maids with water-pitchers on their heads dance thrice to the left, round the M\u0101rj\u0101liya altar, singing 'Oh, this is sweet, this is sweet!' and then thrice to the right in silence. The horse is yoked to the chariot on the right side of the Vedi, and an armed warrior, or the king, mounts, and, taking the bow and three arrows, encircles the Vedi to the right, piercing as he does so with his arrows the target, so that, however, the arrows remain fixed in the hide. Then the horse is unyoked. The Prastot\u1e5b, if seven Stotriyas of the Stotra still remain, then signals to the Hot\u1e5b with the words \u0101 vel\u0101. The Hot\u1e5b thereafter drags the seat of the swing towards him, and thrice breathes out and thrice in (i, 6 fin.). The Mantras at the end of i, 5, are spoken just before this,\u00b9 when he touches simultaneously with his right hand the earth and the seat of the swing, when he lays his hand on the swing, and when he holds it in the air a span above the seat of the swing. After touching the swing with his breast alternately on the right and left sides, the Hot\u1e5b slides over, stretches out his feet in front of him on the earth, and again breathes out and breathes in. He sits down, making a lap, on the swing seat, and with his right hand he touches the back part of the swing, repeating during the first Pratih\u0101ra a Mantra, and then breathes out and in. At the end of the Stotra the drums, including the earth-drum, are split up, all noise ceases, the dancing maids put down their jars on the M\u0101rj\u0101liya altar,\n\n\u00b9 Comm. on \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana, xvii, 15, 10\u201312; in 15, 13, the action of the Hot\u1e5b as regards the swing is dealt with, there being, of course, nothing to correspond with the \u0100ranyaka, i, 6, as a whole.\nand go away. The Prastot\u1e5b, with the word e\u1e63\u0101, urges the \u1e2aot\u1e5b to begin the Ni\u1e63kevalya \u015a\u0101stra. The \u1e2aot\u1e5b then utters after the last Pratih\u0101ra the \u0100h\u0101va, adhvaryo \u015bom\u015b\u0101vo3m.\n\nThe \u015arauta S\u016btras proceed, in book xviii, to give in detail the composition of the several parts of the Mahad Uktha. These details will be found abstracted in the notes to my edition of the Aitareya \u0100ranyakas and need not be repeated here.\n\nThe Mah\u0101vrata section is followed by the Kaus\u012btaki Br\u0101hma\u1e47a Upani\u1e63ad, forming books iii\u2013vi of the \u0100ranyakas. The first book deals in a confused fashion with the fate of the soul after death, apparently attempting to reconcile the double version of the fate of the dead presented in the Brhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka and Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ads. The second is an exposition of the pre-eminence of Pr\u0101\u1e47a as the truth of the universe, but is mainly devoted to showing the practical and quasi-magical uses of the conception. The third is more philosophical, and identifies the real with the inner self, the subject. In the fourth there is a later and more elaborate version of the questioning of Aj\u0101ta\u015batru by B\u0101l\u0101ki found in the Brhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad.\n\nThen follows the Samhit\u0101 Upani\u1e63ad (books vii and viii), treating of the symbolism of the Samhit\u0101, Pada, and Krama texts of the Rgveda. Then an Upani\u1e63ad (book ix) dealing with the rivalry of the Pr\u0101\u1e47as, one of the commonest of Upani\u1e63ad topics. In the following book (x) the internal Agnihotra is minutely described as a substitute for the formal sacrifice; the next book (xi) contains a brief account of the Pr\u0101\u1e47asamv\u0101da, presages of death, and a set of spells. In book xii\n\n---\n\n1 \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana \u015arauta S\u016btra, xvii, 16; 17. On \u015bom\u015b\u0101vo3m, cf. L\u2019Agni\u1e63\u1e6doma, p. 232.\n2 Ed. and trans. by Cowell, Bibl.

I follow in my version the recension adopted by Cowell, noting all variants which make the sense different. The Upani\u1e63ad is analysed after Anquetil du Perron\u2019s version and a Chambers MS. by Weber, Ind. Stud., i, 392\u2013420. As usual, Anquetil\u2019s version is now of no real service.\n3 Deussen, Phil. of the Upanishads, pp. 336, 337.\n4 Ibid., pp. 87, 88. Four new definitions are added to the original twelve.\nis a hymn, or rather spell, addressed to an amulet of Bilva. Book xiii reverts, in a series of quotations inaccurately attributed and cited, to the pre-eminence of the self; book xiv insists on the need of knowing the meaning of the Veda, and book xv contains the Vam\u015ba.\\(^1\\)\n\nFor books i and ii the translation follows the text of Dr. W.F. Friedl\u00e4nder (Berlin, 1900), for iii\u2013vi that of Cowell, for vii\u2013xv that published by myself. Occasional reference is made to two MSS., the Berlin,\\(^2\\) MS. Orient. fol. 630 (ff. 82, dated Samvat 1734 (= A.D. 1677), at R\u0101japura, but many pages injured by water and imperfectly restored), and the Bodleian,\\(^3\\) MS. Sansk. e. 2. Both of these are excellent MSS., and in most places correct each other\u2019s deficiencies. I have derived much benefit from the translations of the Upani\u1e63ads, especially from Cowell\u2019s version, a very remarkable piece of work for so early a date, and from Dr. Friedl\u00e4nder\u2019s rendering of book i. Of native commentaries I have only seen that of \u015aankar\u0101nanda on the Kau\u015bitaki Upani\u1e63ad,\\(^4\\) which is a fair interpretation of the text, but contains many blunders. The Upani\u1e63ad is also paraphrased in part by Vidy\u0101ranya\\(^5\\) in his Sarvopani\u1e63adarth\u0101-nubh\u016btiprak\u0101\u015ba, of which the eighth and ninth chapters, corresponding to the fifth and sixth books of the \u0100ra\u1e47yaka, are printed in Cowell\u2019s edition, and follow the version adopted by \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda. This is probably explained by the fact that \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda is described as the teacher of M\u0101dhav\u0101c\u0101rya.\\(^6\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) For further details, see my article, *J.R.A.S.*, 1908, pp. 363\u201388, which deals also with the probable date of the several parts of the \u0100ra\u1e47yaka. The relations of the \u0100ra\u1e47yaka to the \u0100itareya \u0100ra\u1e47yaka are fully discussed in my edition of the latter (pp. 30 seq., and in the explanatory notes), in which will also be found an index of the proper names of the \u015aa\u1e45kh\u0101yana, the text of and a very full index to Adhy\u0101y\u0101s vii\u2013xv, and a full index to Adhy\u0101y\u0101s i and ii.

R\u0101mat\u012brtha on Maitr\u0101ya\u1e47\u012b Upani\u1e63ad, iii, 2, quotes v, 8, from the ordinary version, and the upper limit of age for \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda\u2019s version is uncertain.\n\nA word may be said in conclusion on the philosophic merit of the Upani\u1e63ad. Its contribution to thought lies in v, 5\u20138, where the unity of consciousness, the interdependence of the organs of sense, the activity of sense, and the objects of sense, and their unity in consciousness are expressed with some clearness and detail. Such passages in truth represent the highest doctrine of the Upani\u1e63ads; the further step which identifies this unity with the Brahman and finds the macrocosm in the microcosm is conceived rather religiously or mystically than philosophically, nor is any attempt made to prove it, while the unity of consciousness is established by tolerable arguments. No doubt the Upani\u1e63ad stands on a much lower plane of thought than the The\u00e6tetus or Parmenides, or the de Anim\u00e2, and the ideas of Plato and Aristotle are infinitely more subtle and complicated; but the fact remains that the Upani\u1e63ad\u2014probably of earlier date\u2014does deal with a philosophic problem in a philosophic spirit, however much that spirit may be confused by mythology. It should be noted that this section is of Br\u0101hma\u1e47ic origin, and that the speculations of Citra in iii deal with pure mythology in the doctrine of the paths after death, a fact which led Max M\u00fcller to ascribe to the K\u1e63atriyas a special interest in this unphilosophical topic, and scarcely speaks well for their theoretical devotion to pure knowledge as against ritual.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Hall, p. 116; Winternitz & Keith, Bodl. Catal., p. 75.\n\n\\(^2\\) In the Telugu edition, Madras, 1883, of 108 Upani\u1e63ads, there is no Kau\u015bitaki (cf. Deussen, Sechzig Upanishad\u2019s, pp. 533, 534), but it is included in a collection of 129 Upani\u1e63ads known to the \u0100ndhrika Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, made in 1850\u20131, in Telingana, by Sir Walter Elliot, Eggeling, India Office Catal., p. 122, and agrees with \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda\u2019s recension. Anquetil usually follows it, Cowell, p. viii.\n\n\\(^3\\) Cowell, p. 5. Deussen, Phil. of the Upanishads, p. 28, gives the references to B\u0101dar\u0101yana\u2019s S\u016btra.\nThe text of the \u0100ranyak\u0101 is on the whole in a satisfactory condition. The exceptions to the rule are mainly in the case of forms whose meaning is obvious, but which contradict established grammatical rules.\\(^1\\) It is obvious that the tradition was unable to discriminate between Vedic forms and mere textual blunders, and no reasonable scholarship will hesitate to amend all the forms given by Cowell as 'strange solecisms which sometimes half remind us of the g\u0101th\u0101s of the Lalita Vistara' from the Upani\u1e63ad, though the mode of emendation may be doubtful. In other cases it is uncertain whether we have a rare usage or a text error. For example, in iv, 7, we have it said of Sarvajit Kau\u1e63\u012btaki, *yad ahor\u0101tr\u0101bhya\u1e41 p\u0101pam akarot sam tad v\u1e5b\u1e45kte*, where the imperfect\\(^2\\) stands in a curious relation to the present, here probably historical.\\(^3\\) Or again, in iii, 4, Sa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda reads *dhunute v\u0101*, where *v\u0101* cannot be ignored as it is by Max M\u00fcller and Deussen. He renders it *a\u015bv\u0101 iva rom\u0101\u1e47i kampanena*, and Cowell regards this as possible. Yet it is hardly possible to doubt that it is a mere transposition of *dhunuv\u0101te*, actually read in some MSS., and that again an error for *dhunv\u0101te*, the verb being intransitive. Or again, in vi, 2; 3, we cannot accept a masculine nominative *b\u1e5bhat*, or in iv, 4, *abhi v\u0101t\u0101t* (Berlin MS.), etc. On the other hand, genuine archaisms exist, e.g., *svapnya\u1e6d\u0101* in vi, 15, *yaj\u016bdar\u0101\u1e25* in a \u1e5ac in iii, 7, and in several other cases the evidence for hyper-Sandhi is convincing; e.g. iii, 5, where *udgithopapa(ra)\u015braya\u1e25* must represent *udgitha upa*\\(^o\\). Or again, in vii, 2; viii, 1, the genitive *asya* is remarkable,\\(^4\\) but certain, and may perhaps be compared with *atha mah\u0101vratasya*, Aitareya \u0100ranyak\u0101, v, 1, 1, though there the following words can be\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Viz., *ni\u1e63i\u1e47ca* in iii, 2 (*si\u1e63i\u1e47ca* or *si\u1e63ikta*); *pr\u0101ti* (read *p\u0101rv\u0101 praja* for *p\u0101rv\u0101h praja\u1e25*) in iv, 8; 10; *samve\u1e63yan* (*samvi\u1e63yan* or *samvek\u1e63yan*) in iv, 10; *veti* (*vyeti*) in v, 1; *ad\u016bdham* (*ud\u016bdham* or *ad\u016bduha\u1e25*) in v, 5, etc.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf. the curious use of *ajayai* in Maitr\u0101ya\u1e47\u012b Samhit\u0101, iv, 3, 1, discussed by Delbr\u00fcck, *Festgruss an B\u00f6hlingk*, p. 25, and *Synt.

Forsch.*, v, 159; Caland, *Altind. Zauber-ritual*, p. 18, n. 2.\nmore easily construed with the genitive. In iv, 8, the accusative with *man*, the subjects being the same, is against the Vedic use\\(^1\\) observed in vii, 8 seq., but occurs in a Rc. The secondary character of ix, 7, is shown by the genitive with *br\u016b*\\(^2\\) and of viii, 11, by the use *yo 'tra vicikitsa sa\u1e45k\u0101ram eva br\u016by\u0101d rte \u1e63ak\u0101ram iti*, where the usual Br\u0101hma\u1e47a construction requires the first person, as in i, 1; ii, 17; viii, 6, and in the parallel Aitareya version.\\(^3\\) So in viii, 1, and xi, 8, *tsari\u1e47\u012br* and *S\u0101vitr\u012br* present apparent feminine nominatives in *s*, which may be pseudo-antiquities or merely errors of the text, as is suggested by the fact that the former word is very variously read in the parallel passages and the latter occurs only in one of the MSS., the other having the correct form.\\(^4\\) In viii, 9, the MSS. agree in reading the accusative *param*, which is quite impossible, and so forth.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Synt.

Again, the Mah\u0101vrata is the body of Indra; therefore one should not recite it for another, lest one place in that other the body of Indra. Again, the Mah\u0101vrata is the body\u00b2 of the man, composed of \u1e5ac, Yajus, and S\u0101man verses, whom they make ready; therefore one should not recite it for another, lest one place in that other the body of all the metres. One may, however, recite it (for another) as Hot\u1e5b priest of Satrins or for one's father or teacher.\u00b3 For in that case the recitation is really for himself, and by his own self he perfects\u2074 the sacrifice. The Stoma of the Mah\u0101vrata is of twenty-five parts. Twenty-four, indeed, are the half-months of the year, so that the year is made up. Again, Praj\u0101pati, the year, is of twenty-five parts. Twenty-four parts are placed at the beginning, and the end is the twenty-fifth.\u2075 A bull is to be offered to Indra and a goat to Praj\u0101pati. That day, indeed, is Indra's; Indra is Praj\u0101pati. (The goat) is the symbol of Praj\u0101pati. Again, among animals the bull is the symbol of Indra. (1.)\n\nThe \u0100jya \u015aastra of the Mah\u0101vrata is the twelve-verse hymn,\u2076 'The guest of every man.' Twelve, indeed, are the months\n\n\u00b9 See Eggeling, S.B.E., xliii, p. xxiii.\n\u00b2 This confirms the view of the comm. on \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana \u015arauta S\u016btra, xviii, 2, 1; that in this school the litany is regarded as of human shape. For the idea, cf. iv, 6, and note.\n\u00b3 In the two latter cases the Mah\u0101vrata must be part, not of a Sattra, but of an Ahina or Ek\u0101ha, see note on Aitareya Aranyakas, v, 3, 3; i, 8, infra, rather contradicts this by recognising a friend also.\n\u2074 Samardhayati approaches the sense 'unites' here, and in some passages of the Maitr\u0101yani Samhit\u0101.

In this hymn there are two metres, G\u0101yatr\u012b and Anu\u1e63\u1e6dubh. In the recitation one adds the twenty-five-verse hymn,\\(^1\\) \u2018Agni, from fire-sticks, men with devotion.\u2019 For the Stoma is of twenty-five parts, and the Sastra is perfect in form when it corresponds with the Stoma. In this hymn there are two metres, Vir\u0101j and Tri\u1e63\u1e6dubh. These make up four (metres). This all,\\(^2\\) indeed, is fourfold, so that all this is made up. The Pra\u00fcga Sastra is in Tri\u1e63\u1e6dubh. The Tri\u1e63\u1e6dubh is the metre of Indra, and so he is united with his own metre. The (T\u1e5bca\\(^3\\)), \u2018Were not they, who were magnified by praise,\u2019 is addressed to V\u0101yu, and contains the words \u2018great\u2019 and \u2018magnify.\u2019 It contains the word \u2018great,\u2019 for this day is described as \u2018great\u2019 (Mah\u0101-vrata). The following T\u1e5bca,\\(^4\\) \u2018As far as the strength of the body, as far as might,\u2019 is addressed to Indra and V\u0101yu, because (of the expression) \u2018As far as men perceiving with vision.\u2019 \u2018The fair eye of you two, Varu\u1e47a,\u2019 is (the T\u1e5bca\\(^5\\)) addressed to Mitra and Varu\u1e47a, because (of the expression) \u2018The sun goes extending (the light) of the two gods.\u2019 \u2018Who will hear, who of those who merit worship,\u2019 is (the T\u1e5bca\\(^6\\)) addressed to the A\u015bvins, because (of the expression) \u2018Whom the daughter of the sun chose.\u2019 \u2018How, what priest\u2019s (sacrifice) has the great one magnified,\u2019 is (the T\u1e5bca\\(^7\\)) addressed to Indra, and contains the words \u2018great\u2019 and \u2018magnify.\u2019 It contains the word \u2018great,\u2019 for this day is described as \u2018great.\u2019 \u2018Who is of you a protector, Vasus, who of you a guardian,\u2019 is (the T\u1e5bca\\(^8\\)) addressed to the All-gods, because of the expression \u2018Varu\u1e47a, Mitra, from the stronger mortal.\u2019 \u2018May this\n\n\\(^1\\) RV., vii, 1.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf. Kausitaki Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, ii, 1; xix, 4; xxviii, 7.\n\n\\(^3\\) RV., vii, 91, 1\u20133. The statement that the words \u2018great\u2019 and \u2018magnified\u2019 are contained is not correct as regards the former, but the correctness of the version seems clear from ii, 7; 8, though but for the parallels one might render \u2018has the word \u201cgreat,\u201d having the word \u201cmagnified\u201d = having the word \u201cgreat.\u201d\u2019\n\n\\(^4\\) R.V., vii, 91, 4\u20136. The reasons given are only, I think, for the attribution to the deities, who correspond to those of the original Pra\u00fcga, and it is not sought\u2014as Friedl\u00e4nder, p. 32, n. 3, thinks\u2014to prove that each verse has an equivalent of \u2018great.\u2019\n\n\\(^5\\) RV., vii, 61, 1\u20133.\n\n\\(^6\\) RV., iv, 43, 1\u20133.\n\n\\(^7\\) RV., iv, 23, 1\u20133.

This is the Pra\u016bga \u015aastra of V\u0101madeva, arranged in Trcas in Tri\u1e63\u1e6dubhs, and containing the word 'Ka.' Praj\u0101pati, indeed, is V\u0101madeva; in Praj\u0101pati so do they obtain all desires.\n\nOthers say the (\u015aastra of the) morning pressing should not be in Tri\u1e63\u1e6dubhs. Otherwise it confuses the (parts of the service) which have fixed metres. (The \u015aastra) should be that of the one-day rite. The one-day rite is Brahman; this day is Brahman; so Brahman is perfected by Brahman. (2.)\n\n'Thee as a car for help' is the strophe of the Marutvatiya Sastra. 'This juice pressed, Vasu,' is the antistrophe. This is the regular scheme for the one-day rite. The Br\u0101hma\u1e47a as to it has already been set forth. After reciting first the (hymn of) Vasukra, 'Fair has been the singer's onset,' he inserts a Nivid in the Tri\u1e63\u1e6dubh (hymn), 'Great, hero-like, controlling men, is Indra.' Now (the reason) that he recites the Vasukra hymn first is that Indra is Vasukra, and (the reason for reciting) 'Great, hero-like, controlling men, is Indra,' is that it contains the word 'great,' for this day is described as 'great.' (3.)\n\nThen he offers the oblations of ghee. Thus he wins success for the calming of the sacrifice and the healing of the sacrificers. There are eight (oblations). By these, indeed, the gods obtained all success; thus also do sacrificers by means of them obtain all success. Then he mutters the mutterings\n\n1 RV., vii, 95, 4-6.\n2 As only three Trcas are from RV., iv, this is curious, but the comm. on \u015arauta S\u016btra, xvii, 8, 10, explains that the three new Trcas give the name to the whole to distinguish it from the Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha Pra\u016bga, Kau\u1e63itaki Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, xxv, 2, of the Vi\u1e63uvant.\n3 Cf.

They are Parim\u0101ds (those which boil around). The waters indeed are Parim\u0101ds, for by the waters all this is boiled around, and so they are the Parim\u0101ds. Now the hymn is food. The waters indeed come first before the coming of food, and the waters are the Parim\u0101ds. Again, the Parim\u0101ds are the nails, teeth, body, and hair. Therefore are they to be employed, for they are bringers of good fortune. There are twenty-five and the conclusion.\\(^1\\) The \u0100\u1e45girasa (S\u0101man) serves as a support; of that it is a symbol. (Then comes\\(^2\\) the) Bh\u016btechad (S\u0101man); (in reciting it he feels) \u2018I have reached Indra\u2019s dear abode.\u2019 Then the Kro\u015ba and Anukro\u015ba (they use)\u2014(thereby) have they won; then the Payas (S\u0101man)\u2014(thereby) have they won; then the Arka and Arkapu\u1e63pa (S\u0101mans). Arka is Agni here; Arkapu\u1e63pa is \u0100ditya. If the S\u0101man singers sing a round according to these (S\u0101mans), then they say to the Hot\u1e5b priest, \u2018Mutter after us.\u2019 If they sing, he should mutter after them;\\(^3\\) if they sing thus, or even if they do not sing, he should mutter all the same. (4.)\n\nThese are the seven divine metres;\\(^4\\) therefore he should mutter after the (S\u0101man singers). Again, Indra\u2019s indeed is this day, for Indra are the mutterings; therefore he should mutter after them. Then standing there he adores the fire in each of its members, saying \u2018Honour, Honour.\u2019 For the gods are not above receiving honour. He should honour the parts of the fire when it is kindled, if it is on the high altar.\\(^5\\) Then\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) For the Parim\u0101ds (connected with mad, \u2018be glad,\u2019 by S\u0101yana on \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, x, 1, 2, 8, but see Weber, Ind.

To him said Indra, \u2018Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra, choose a boon.\u2019 Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra said, \u2018Let me know thee.\u2019 \u2018(Choose) again.\u2019 \u2018Thee only.\u2019 \u2018(Choose) a third time.\u2019 \u2018Thee only.\u2019 To him said Indra, \u2018I am the great (m.) and the great (f.); the god and the goddess; the Brahman and the Br\u0101hma\u1e47\u012b.\u2019 Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra was still fain to know more. To him said Indra, \u2018I am that which I have said, but what is more, he that performs no penance may be even such as I am.\u2019 Then indeed did Indra proclaim the Vy\u016bh\u1e5btis.

Then, putting his left side over (the swing), he mutters, 'Let the Rudras mount thee with the Tris\u1e6dubh metre. They are thy mounters.' So he says, and 'After them I mount for self-rule.' Self-rule, indeed, is, as it were, something more than royal sway. Then, putting his right side over, he mutters, 'Let the \u0100dityas mount thee with the Jagat\u012b metre. They are thy mounters.' So he says, and 'After them I mount for universal sway.' Universal sway, indeed, is, as it were, something more than self-rule. Then, putting his left side over, he mutters, 'Let the All-gods mount thee with the Anu\u1e63\u1e6dubh metre. They are thy mounters.' So he says, and 'After them I mount for the fulfilling of desire.' The fulfilling of desire is the best of all. Then, having slipped along over (the plank), he brings down his feet towards the east and rests them on the ground. He is thus higher than this world. (The reason) why he places (his feet so) is that he thus rests on this world as a secure resting-place. Then he breathes forth thrice and draws in breath thrice. Then, making a lap over the south and north \\(^1\\) (sides of the plank), he strokes the plank of the swing from west to east with the span of the right (hand), saying, 'Praj\u0101pati mount thee, V\u0101yu swing thee.' Praj\u0101pati indeed mounts it, V\u0101yu swings it, as alive. Then he breathes forth and draws in breath thrice. Then, holding both hands to the east, he mutters. (7.)\n\n'May speech with breath, I with breath, eye with mind, I with mind, Praj\u0101pati with cattle, I with cattle (be united).' So he prays.\\(^2\\) 'Thou art a fair-winged bird'\u2014breath has fair wings; 'I shall proclaim this speech'\u2014he speaks being\n\n\\(^1\\) He sits facing east, keeping one leg to the right (=south) and one to the left (=north); for the form, cf. Wackernagel, Altind. Gramm., ii, 1, 147, 148. The Pet. Lexx. and Monier-Williams render 'hanging over to the right,' which I do not understand. It might be taken (like daksi\u1e47ottara, Gobhila Grhya S\u016btra, i, 7, 4) as with the legs crossed. Cf. S\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana Srauta S\u016btra, xvii, 16, 7, and comm.: yasmin putr\u0101dayas ti\u1e63\u1e6dhanti; Weber, Ind. Stud., v, 397; x, 115.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf.

N., not N. N.' So many, indeed, as he enumerates and shakes forth from this divine chariot, he casts forth. The two following are not for him to enjoy; so he overcomes him (breath); so, having overcome him, he places him in his body. V\u0101yu, indeed, becoming breath recites this hymn. So he overcomes him; so, having overcome him, he places him in his body. Yoked indeed to his teacher is he who gains the \u015aastra of this day. Being yoked to his teacher, his breath is liable to be taken away. So he overcomes him; so, having overcome him, he places him in his body. For such a divinity there is no piercing by poisoned arrow, nor sword, nor axe, nor anything else. He who reviles him who knows this becomes worse; not so he who knows this. There is no piercing one who knows. (8.)\n\nAdhy\u0101ya II.\n\nHe begins the hymn with the word 'him.' The word 'him' is breath; by breath he begins the hymn. Again, the word\n\n1 i.e. V\u0101yu, who is breath (Deussen, Phil. of the Upanishads, pp. 107\u20139) and the teacher. The text tells how he overcomes them and makes them bhogya. Friedl\u00e4nder renders 'have no right to the Pr\u0101\u1e47a which he has to enjoy,' but though this gives an approximate sense it seems difficult to find a parallel construction; for the one assumed, see Delbr\u00fcck, Synt. Forsch., v, 148. It would be easier if we could read tan for tam, but it is not essential.\n\n2 For the construction, cf. Kausitaki Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, x, 2; xvii, 9.\n\n3 See Zimmer, Altind. Leben, p. 299; Murray, Rise of Greek Epic, pp. 120 seq.\n\n4 Cf. Aitareya \u0100ranyaka, i, 3, 1.\n'him' is strength and sap; so he places in the hymn strength and sap. Again, the word 'him' is immortality; so he places immortality in himself. The R\u0101jana is (the S\u0101man of) the Pr\u1e63\u1e6dha (Stotra). The R\u0101jana is manifestly the S\u0101man; so he unites (the hymn\\(^1\\)) with its own S\u0101man. It consists of verses not specially marked.\\(^2\\) Praj\u0101pati, indeed, is not specially marked. That is the symbol of Praj\u0101pati. Some say it should consist of verses with 'Ka' in them, for Ka is Praj\u0101pati and that is a symbol of Praj\u0101pati. Then he recites inaudibly the silent recitation. Speech indeed is this day, mind the silent recitation; so with mind he perfects speech. 'That was mightiest in the worlds' is the strophe\\(^3\\) Trca. 'Waxing\\(^4\\) with strength, of great might,' has the word 'wax,' and so has the word 'great,' for the day is described as 'great.' The body is of twenty-five parts. He recites (the hymn\\(^5\\)) with the addition of the nada (verses). The body indeed is of twenty-five parts, offspring and cattle are additions, so he increases the body by children, cattle, servants, and food,\\(^6\\) (in using) the nada verses.\\(^7\\) He puts the Tri\u1e63\u1e6dubh P\u0101das first,\\(^8\\) then the P\u0101das of the nada verses. Having joined the first P\u0101da of the nada verses with the first Tri\u1e63\u1e6dubh P\u0101da, he pauses; having joined the second with the second Tri\u1e63\u1e6dubh (P\u0101da), he utters the syllable om. Having joined the third with the third Tri\u1e63\u1e6dubh (P\u0101da), he pauses; having joined the fourth with the fourth Tri\u1e63\u1e6dubh (P\u0101da), he utters the syllable om. He recites thrice the first (verse) thus varied, and the others which follow are similarly varied. He omits the second half-verse of the third verse of the hymn and the second of the nada. This is the opening of the mouth; by that he utters speech. By the mouth indeed\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Enat seems needed.\n\n\\(^2\\) i.e. verses not specially assigned to others by some mark are his; Macdonell, Brhaddevat\u0101, ii, 5; L\u00e9vi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, p. 16, n. 4.\n\n\\(^3\\) RV., x, 120, 1.\n\n\\(^4\\) RV., x, 120, 2.\n\n\\(^5\\) Read tan (i.e. tad).\n\n\\(^6\\) Iti probably not='etc.' in such a case.

He recites these two (half-verses) before the Dvipad\u0101s.\\(^1\\) Thus his Stotra verse is not separated by a break. After reciting the body (verses), he recites the s\u016bdadohas\\(^2\\) (verse) \u2018of the milk-yielder.\u2019 Food indeed is the s\u016bdadohas (verse). By food these joints are united. Again, immortality is the s\u016bdadohas (verse); so he places immortality in the body. Again, the s\u016bdadohas (verse) is the form of the \u0100h\u0101va call. So just as wood may be joined by a string or a piece of leather, the s\u016bdadohas verse joins all the Vedas. (1.)\n\nThen he recites the head (verses). They consist of three Tr\u0113as. Three indeed are the bones\\(^3\\) of his head; them by these he unites. These three again are each threefold, and so make up nine verses. Nine indeed are the breaths in the head. They have the word \u2018hymn\u2019 in them. This is the symbol of this day. (2.)\n\nThen he recites the neck (verses). They are three verses. Three indeed are the joints\\(^4\\) of the neck. These he unites by those. The last is an U\u1e63\u1e47ih. It is the shoulder, large and expansive. (3.)\n\nThen he recites the collarbone\\(^5\\) (verse). It is a Tr\u012b\u1e63\u1e6dubh. Therefore the collarbone is the strongest. The (verse\\(^6\\)) \u2018Indra, the mighty arms of thee, strong one,\u2019 is suitable to the arms. Then he recites the strophe and antistrophe of the Rathantara. The Br\u0101hma\u1e47a for them has been set forth already. Then he recites the Dh\u0101yy\u0101 (verse). This is the Dh\u0101yy\u0101, for it is placed in all beings. It indeed is placed on the right side, therefore a woman lies on a man\u2019s right side. Then he recites the Prag\u0101tha of the Rathantara.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See ii, 11 fin.\n\n\\(^2\\) RV., viii, 69, 3.\n\n\\(^3\\) Here, again, the number is probably fanciful, cf. Hoernle, Osteology, pp. 172 seq., and the stock division of the head into three, \u015a\u0101tapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, xii, 2, 4, 9, etc. For the nine breaths\u2014apertures\u2014cf. Deussen, Phil. of the Upanishads, p. 283, where, however, the older passages are not quoted, and note on Aitareya \u0100ranyaka, i, 4, 1.\n\n\\(^4\\) Probably purely unscientific; the official osteology (Hoernle, Osteology, p. 64) is quite different. For sections 2\u20136, cf. notes on the Aitareya \u0100ranyaka, v, 2, 1 ; 2 ; i, 4, 1 ; \u015a\u0101kh\u0101yana \u015arauta S\u016btra, xviii, 2\u20136.\n\n\\(^5\\) So ak\u1e63\u0101 certainly, see Hoernle, Osteology, pp. 202 sq.; \u015arauta S\u016btra, xviii, 4, 1 ; 5, 1 ; Z.D.M.G., 1908, p. 139.\n\n\\(^6\\) RV., vi, 47, 8c.\nB\u1e5bh\u0101mana for it has been set forth already. The hymn\\(^1\\) is 'Who alone of mortals deserves oblation.' He recites it by P\u0101das. Taking out the second verse of it, he puts in as second (verse) the second (verse) of the hymn,\\(^2\\) 'All my other friends have come.' Thus he interweaves the two sides to prevent them separating. Therefore he performs all actions by (the use of) both sides. (4.)\n\nThen he recites the hand (verses). They indeed are three. These are the joints\\(^3\\) of his hand. These he unites by those. The first is in an excessive metre. This is the thumb. So the thumb approaches all the fingers. The right side has the Rathantara, the left the B\u1e5bhat, and the B\u1e5bh\u0101mana for it has been set forth. These two sides, with B\u1e5bhat and Rathantara, are of twenty-four parts. Twenty-four are the half-months of the year, so that the year is made up. (5.)\n\nThen he recites the Caturuttara (verses). They are the spine. They are twenty-one verses. Twenty-one indeed are the joints\\(^4\\) of the spine. These he unites by those. They make up seven T\u1e5bcas. Seven indeed are the metres, so that all the metres are made up. They have the word 'hymn.' That is the symbol of this day. (6.)\n\nThen he recites the (sets of) eighty verses. He recites them in correspondence with the Stotra verses, G\u0101yatr\u012b (corresponding to) G\u0101yatra, U\u1e63\u1e47ih and Brhat\u012b (sets) to Brhad and Rathantara. The G\u0101yatr\u012b (set) is the right side, the U\u1e63\u1e47ih the left, the Brhat\u012b the middle. In the middle indeed of the body is food deposited. Between the two Tri\u1e63\u1e6dubhs there is a Tri\u1e63\u1e6dubh in a Nivid.\\(^5\\) They belong to Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra, are corresponding, and have the word 'hymn.' For Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra was the seer of that (hymn). The strophes contain the word 'great,' and they have the word 'magnify.'\\(^6\\) It (the hymn) has the word 'magnified'\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) RV., vi, 22.

(7.)\n\n'Great Indra, who by might,' and 'is magnified by Vatsa's lauds': with this verse\u00b9 he commences the G\u0101yatr\u012b (set of) eighty (verses). It (the verse) contains both the words 'great' and 'magnify.' It (the litany) has the words 'great' and 'magnified.' It has the word 'great,' for this day is described as 'great.' (8.)\n\n'What joys thou didst bring, Indra,' and 'his praises magnify, great one': with this verse\u00b2 he begins the B\u1e5bhat\u012b (set of) eighty (verses). It (the verse) contains both the words 'great' and 'magnify.' It (the hymn) has the words 'great' and 'magnify.' It has the word 'great,' for this day is described as 'great.' 'May this delightful (Soma) for thee,' and 'Hither, with thy bay steeds, Indra,' are the two hymns.\u00b3 (The reason) why he recites them at the end is that he may commence the U\u1e63\u1e47ih (set of) eighty verses (after concluding) with perfect B\u1e5bhat\u012bs. (9.)\n\n'Indra in the poured libations,' and 'He gains the power that magnifies; for he is great': with this verse\u2074 he begins the U\u1e63\u1e47ih (set of) eighty verses. It (the verse) contains both the words 'great' and 'magnify.' It (the hymn) has the words 'great' and 'magnify.' It has the word 'great,' for this day is described as 'great.' These sets of eighty (verses) recited together make up 720.\u2075 720 indeed are the days and nights of the year. Thus by these (sets of) eighty he obtains the days and nights of the year. Some make into U\u1e63\u1e47ihs the G\u0101yatr\u012bs by means of the ends of the S\u0101mans; others, again, add (to make the U\u1e63\u1e47ihs) (sets of) four syllables. From the B\u1e5bhat\u012b (set of) eighty (verses) he takes out eighty (sets of) four syllables; from the Kakubh Prag\u0101thas twenty-four (sets of) four syllables; these 104 sets of four syllables he inserts in the\n\n\u00b9 RV., viii, 6, 1. For sections 6\u201317, cf. notes on Aitareya \u0100ranyaka, i, 4, 3; v, 2, 3\u20135; S\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana \u015arauta S\u016btra, xviii, 7\u201321.\n\u00b2 RV., viii, 97, 1.\n\u00b3 RV., iii, 44; 45.\n\u2074 RV., viii, 13, 1.\n\u2075 For this, see Aitareya \u0100ranyaka, p. 36, and notes on v, 2, 3\u20135: Eggeling, S.B.E., xli, 111 seq.\n104 G\u0101yatr\u012bs. So the G\u0101yatr\u012bs are turned into U\u1e63\u1e47ihs. But one need not be concerned with this.\\footnote{1}{i.e. the precise method of the transformation.} The (result) is here brought about. \u2018Sing to Indra the S\u0101man\u2019: (the reason) why he recites this\\footnote{2}{RV., viii, 98, 1; cf. ii, 9. The hymns are U\u1e63\u1e47ih and Brhat\u012b respectively. Samsiddha is a metaphor from cooking, like samask\u1e5bta.} last is that he may commence the va\u015ba (hymn), (after concluding) with perfect U\u1e63\u1e47ihs. (10.)\n\nThen he recites the va\u015ba (hymn)\\footnote{3}{RV., viii, 46. See Pischel, Vedische Studien, i, 7 sq.; Aitareya \u0100ranyaka, i, 5, 1; Eggeling, S.B.E., xli, 112, n. 2.}. The belly is the va\u015ba hymn. With it, when made ready, whatever is outside it would come into immediate proximity. Thus it matures what is within the belly. Therefore many deities and many metres are recited in the va\u015ba (hymn). Therefore much variegated food is deposited in the belly. Then (he recites) the two half-verses\\footnote{4}{ii, 1; cf. \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, viii, 6, 2, 4, and for the Aindr\u0101gna S\u016bkta (RV., viii, 40), Eggeling, l.c., p. 113, n. 1.} which were taken out. Then (he recites) the s\u016bdadohas (verse). It is then left out (afterwards). Here it has been recited twenty-four times. (11.)\n\nThen he recites the Dvipad\u0101s. Metre indeed is a support, so that the Dvipad\u0101s serve as a support. (12.)\n\nThen he recites the hymn to Indra and Agni, reciting it as in G\u0101yatr\u012b. Indra and Agni are supports, so that support is obtained. (13.)\n\nThen he recites the \u0100vapana.\\footnote{5}{i.e. insertion, which explains the last words. Cf. Aitareya \u0100ranyaka, i, 5, 2; \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, viii, 6, 2, 3; \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana \u015arauta S\u016btra, xviii, 17.} The \u0100vapana is a support, so that support is obtained. Then these go on again straightforward. (14.)\n\nThen he recites the Anu\u1e63\u1e6dubh text. Speech indeed is this day; speech the Anu\u1e63\u1e6dubh. So in speech he places speech. \u2018Ye have gone to the sky, ye have gone to the sky\u2019: with this hymn\\footnote{6}{The Bodleian MS. reads jaya for yaya. The reference is clearly to RV., viii, 34, 1d\u201315d.} he approaches the gods. The Trca \u2018He, of old, inspiring sages,\u2019\\footnote{7}{The Bodleian MS. reads, correctly, pratnath\u0101 and kaviv\u1e5bdh\u0101; see RV., viii, 63, 4.} has the word \u2018hymn,\u2019 and by reason of it is\nperfect. The last verse is in G\u0101yatr\u012b, and by reason of it it is perfect. In\u00b9 'Thou art the great ruler here' there is the word 'great,' for this day is described as 'great.' (15.)\n\nThen he recites the hundred Tr\u012b\u1e63\u1e6dubhs. The Tr\u012b\u1e63\u1e6dubh is Indra's metre; so he perfects him with his own metre. The Hiranyast\u016bpa\u00b2 hymn and the Y\u0101ta\u016btiya\u00b3 hymn correspond to the Brhat and Rathantara. For the Brhat and Rathantara are put in front. The Sajan\u012bya\u2074 hymn and (the hymn\u2075) 'Priests, bear to Indra the Soma' make up twenty-seven verses. Twenty-seven are the Nak\u1e63atras; thus he obtains the majesty of the Nak\u1e63atras. He should recite (a hymn) of Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra, for Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra beheld it. He should recite (a hymn) of V\u0101madeva, for that is pleasant\u2076 to the gods. He should recite (a hymn) of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha, for that is best for the gods. Then before the Udubrahmiya\u2077 (hymn) he recites (the verses) with interwoven P\u0101das. All desires, indeed, are within this hymn. Just as having shut cattle in a pen one puts a bar and a pin\u2078 (to keep them in), so by these intertwined verses he grasps all desires on either side and places them in the body. Again, of the Udubrahmiya hymn the last (verse) has the word 'hymn.' That is the symbol of this day. He concludes by repeating this (verse) thrice. Having concluded he mutters the Ukthav\u012brya. The one-day form comes first; the one-day is a support, so that support is obtained. The Mah\u0101vrata form comes next. In\u2079 'Thou art great' there is the word 'great,' for this day is described as 'great.' (16.)\n\nReckoning in the \u015b\u016bdadohas verse, recited once, which has to be supplied throughout the litany, but without the silent recitation, there are a thousand Brhat\u012bs.

So many are the days of a hundred years; thus he obtains the days of a hundred years.\\(^1\\) Some say (the thousand) is composed of Anu\u1e63\u1e6dubhs. Speech indeed is that day, speech the Anu\u1e63\u1e6dubh, speech all beings; again, speech is this all, so they say. But it is fixed that it is composed of B\u1e5bhat\u012bs. For he that gives heat here is connected with the B\u1e5bhat\u012b; so he perfects him with his own metre. Three times he calls (to the Adhvaryu). Three indeed are these worlds; so he obtains these worlds. The Y\u0101jy\u0101 verse is taken from the one-day (rite). The one-day (rite) is a support, so that support is obtained. They loosen the swing, before the secondary va\u1e63at\\(^2\\) cry is made. He descends towards the east (to meet) him who bears the Graha as he advances. He thrusts away to the west the plank of the swing. Touching the Graha, he mutters, \u2018This victory I have won, let me be associated with it, lest I sever myself from this victory.\u2019 The Atigr\u0101hya is for Vi\u015bvakarman. Praj\u0101pati\u2019s indeed is this day, Praj\u0101pati is Vi\u015bvakarman; thus he perfects him with his own symbol.\n\nThis day Indra proclaimed to A\u1e45giras, A\u1e45giras to D\u012brghatamas. Therefore did D\u012brghatamas live ten lives of man.

'Of a truth the fair refulgence was established' is a hymn\\(^10\\) to J\u0101tavedas. The last (verse), 'With hymns of might hath Agni now been praised,' contains the word 'hymn.'

Is there a secret place in the world where thou wilt set me, or is there any road and wilt thou set me in the world to which that road leads?\u2019 He said, \u2018I do not know that. I will ask my teacher.\u2019 Going to his father he asked him, saying, \u2018Thus did he question me. How shall I reply?\u2019 He replied, \u2018I also do not know that; we will learn in his house and gain the knowledge, for even others give to us. Come, we will both go.\u2019 With fuel in his hand he went to Citra G\u0101ngy\u0101yani, saying, \u2018Let me approach thee.\u2019 He said to him, \u2018Thou art fit to receive the knowledge of Brahman, since thou hast not been proud.

Yasya and anyataro, suggested by Max M\u00fcller, would be easier, but mystery is in place, and too much need not be made of it. Deussen paraphrases it satisfactorily as \u2018Is there any end of transmigration, and will you set me on the path to it?\u2019 \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda\u2019s recension has the very unsatisfactory anyam ut\u0101ho for anyatamo, and renders v\u0101dhw\u0101 as baddhv\u0101, contrasting a secret with a non-secret place. Max M\u00fcller renders \u2018Is there a hidden place . . . or is it the other way?\u2019 B\u00f6htlingk, Ber. d. s\u00fcdls. Ges. d. Wiss., xlii, 198, adopts practically the same view as Deussen does.\n\n3 Deussen reads agran\u012br for gr\u0101hi; \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda has brahm\u0101rgha\u1e25, but the text, if less easy, is certain.\n\n4 \u2018Gladdens them not,\u2019 in \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda\u2019s version. Max M\u00fcller\u2019s conjecture aparapakse is not necessary.\n\n5 I follow Deussen. The moon is the centre of the Devay\u0101na and Pitry\u0101na, and sends on the one who can reply. \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda, Cowell, Max M\u00fcller, take praty\u0101ha as \u2018reject.\u2019 For the theory, cf. Brhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad, vi, 1 (= 2 K.); Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad, v, 3\u201310; and Deussen, Sechzig Upanishad\u2019s, pp. 137\u201340, with whose view of the priority of these two Upani\u1e63ads to the Kau\u1e63itaki I agree. Max M\u00fcller recognises two classes: the former, which rejects the moon and is set free at once; the latter, which rejects Svarga, and is then set free, but the sense \u2018set free\u2019 is hardly to be got out of atis\u1e5bjate. It means \u2018sends on.\u2019\non; him who answers it not, it rains down on earth, becoming itself rain. He is born on earth as a worm, or a grasshopper, or a fish, or a bird, or a lion, or a boar, or a snake (?), or a tiger, or a man, or another creature, in one or other station according to his deeds and his knowledge. Him, when he has arrived, it asks, 'Who art thou?' To it should he reply, 'From the light I came as seed, O seasons, from that produced as the fifteen-fold fatherland. In the man as creator ye placed me, and by man as creator impregnated the mother. I am born and again born as the twelve-month (year) and the thirteen-month (year), from the twelve-fold, the thirteen-fold father. I know this and I recognise this.

Stud., i, 396.\n\n2 What follows is in verse, and as it has been much misunderstood (even in Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance) I give the text as I restore it\u2014\n\n'vicak\u1e63an\u0101d rtavo reta \u0101bh\u1e5btam pa\u00f1cada\u015b\u0101t pras\u016btat pitry\u0101vatas |\ntan m\u0101 pumsi kartur erayadhvam punsa kartur m\u0101tari m\u0101si\u015biuc\u0101 || 1 ||\nsa j\u0101yam\u0101na upaj\u0101yam\u0101no dv\u0101da\u015batrayodasopam\u0101sah |\ndv\u0101da\u015batrayodasena pitr\u0101 sam tad vide 'ham prati tad vide 'ham\ntan martavo 'm\u1e5btyava \u0101bh\u0101rdhvam || 2 ||'\n\nI keep erayadhvam; Deussen suggests airoyadhvam, but the augment is not needed. For the m\u0101 ni\u015b\u012bm ca of the ordinary recension (including the Berlin and Bodleian MSS.), or the m\u0101si\u015bikta of \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101\u1e47anda's recension, adopted by Deussen, I read m\u0101-\u0101si\u015biuc\u0101 as 2nd plur. perf. with strong form (Whitney, Sanskrit Grammar, p. 284) metri causa. Bloomfield, p. 588a, conjectures ni\u015b\u012bncata, but this would hardly have been corrupted, and the conjecture ignores the fact that, though the first two P\u0101das are in Jagati, the third and presumably the fourth are in Tri\u1e63\u1e6dubh. The verse occurs in Jaiminlya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, i, 18; 50, where tan m\u0101 pumsi is, of course, palaeographically the same as tan, which (=retas) I prefer, and the last P\u0101da reads pumsa kartur m\u0101tary \u0101si\u015bikta, also a Tri\u1e63\u1e6dubh. In v. 2 j\u0101yam\u0101na is Deussen's certain restoration for j\u0101ya (Berlin reads j\u0101yam\u0101n\u0101k, only showing how easy the omission was). For dv\u0101da\u015batrayodasopam\u0101sah, Cowell's MS. A, Berlin and Bodleian MSS. have dv\u0101da\u015batrayodas\u0101 m\u0101sah, \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101\u1e47anda's recension \u1e5btrayodasa upam\u0101sah, which gives perhaps the pronunciation of the real text, though it is much more probably d\u016b\u0101, as in P\u0101da 3. I read sam, not \u0101sam, and metri causa begin a new P\u0101da with it; vide I recognise as a verbal form, not an infinitive. In his version Cowell accepts one view of \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101\u1e47anda that rtavah is in the first verse abl., in the second acc., and that vide is infin., \u0101sam, 'I was.' Deussen takes the other view of \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101\u1e47anda in the first case, in both cases rightly, of rtavah as voc., but adheres to \u0101sam, vide as infin., and reads m\u1e5btyave for am\u1e5btyave, which is unnecessary, since we need not take the verb as imperfect. His martavo for the archaic ma rtavo I have accepted metri causa. The Berlin MS. in a correction reads \u0101rabhadhvam, like \u0100nand. MS. Gh. Max M\u00fcller agrees with Cowell, and both render the first two second persons as if third persons. \u0100nand. has ni\u015bikta. Cf. J.A.O.S., xix, 118.\nme, seasons, to deathlessness.

(2.)\n\nHe having reached the road of the gods arrives at the world of Agni, then at the world of V\u0101yu, the world of Varu\u1e47a, the world of Indra, the world of Praj\u0101pati, the world of Brahman. Of that world is the lake Ara (of enemies), the moments Yestiha (which destroy the sacrifice), the Vijara (unaging) river, the Ilya tree, the S\u0101lajya city, the Aparajita (unconquerable) palace, Indra and Praj\u0101pati the doorkeepers, the hall Vibhu, the throne Vicaksan\u0101, the couch Amitaujas (of unsurpassed splendour), the dear M\u0101nasi (spirit of mind), her peer C\u0101ksus\u012b (spirit of the eye), who weave the worlds holding flowers in their hands, the Apsarases, Amb\u0101 and Amb\u0101yav\u012b, and the streams Ambay\u0101h. The knower advances to that world. Brahman says of him, 'Run to meet him with the glory due to me. He has won the unaging river. He shall never grow old.' (3.)\n\n1 'Who am I? Who art thou?' in \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda's recension. The father and son are both here identified with the year of twelve or thirteen months (upam\u0101sa is curious and refers to the intercalary month). The question 'Who art thou?' is probably the moon's (so all the translators). It might be rhetorical, and the omission of iti is doubtful; see Synt. Forsch., v, 533; Eggeling, S.B.E., xlv, 61, 355.\n\n2 We need not doubt the personal Brahman anywhere in this Upani\u1e63ad. On the other hand, neither the Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a nor \u0100ranyakas, i-iii, know him; cf. von Schroeder, Ind. Lit., p. 91.\n\n3 Cf. Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad, viii, 5, 3, where occur the Somasavana tree, the Apar\u0101jit\u0101 city, the Prabhuvimita, and the Airamadiya lake, the Ara and Nya seas, etc.; and Weber, Ind. Stud., i, 398, 399.\n\n4 This is Weber's rendering, taking yesti from yaj. It is admittedly conjectural, but yesti is read in Cowell's MSS. and the Berlin MS., and is probably correct.\n\n5 \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda derives it from il\u0101, so evidently read ilya, not ilpa. Deussen accepts this. Cf. Hillebrandt, Ved.

For jag\u0101ni, a vox nihilis, read jaganti, an easy corruption, as the i is easily confused with an \u0101-i. Below Deussen joins 'with my glory' with the following words, but this is against their place in the sentence.\n\n8 Weber, p. 183, has amb\u0101yav\u0101h, like \u0100nand. MS. Gh. The form is irregular, and may be an error for amb\u0101yav\u012bh. The exact sense of these expressions must remain in doubt, but probably they are all variants of 'mother,' B\u00f6htlingk's Dict., s.vv.\nFive hundred Apsarases advance towards him, a hundred with fruit\\(^1\\) in their hands, a hundred with unguents, a hundred with garlands, a hundred with garments, a hundred with aromatic powders. Him they adorn with the ornaments of Brahman. He, adorned with the ornaments of Brahman, knowing Brahman, advances to Brahman(n.). He arrives at the lake of enemies. He crosses it by his mind. Men who know but the present, on coming to it, are overwhelmed. He arrives at the moments which destroy the sacrifice. They flee from him. He arrives at the unaging river. He crosses it by his mind alone. His good deeds and his evil deeds then shake themselves off.\\(^2\\) His dear relatives obtain his good deeds, his enemies his bad. Just as a man driving on a chariot may look down at the wheels of the chariot, so may he look down at day and night, good deeds and evil deeds, and all opposites.

I read tira\u015bcye, see Whitney on Atharva Veda, xv, 3, 5. Cf. also Ai\u1e6dareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, viii, 12; Jaimin\u012bya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, ii, 24.

Thereon sits Brahman. The knower first mounts on it with one foot. Brahman asks him, \u2018Who art thou?\u2019 To him let him reply. (5.)\n\n\u2018I am the season, of the season, born of the ether as womb, as seed from wife,\\(^4\\) the glory of the year, the soul of all that has been. Thou art the soul of all that has been. What thou art, that am I.\u2019 He says to him, \u2018Who am I?\u2019 \u2018Truth,\u2019 let him say. \u2018What is truth?\u2019 \u2018That which is other than the gods and the breaths, that is being (sat); the gods and the breaths are that (tyam). This is called by the (one)\\(^5\\) word \u201ctruth\u201d (sattya\u1e41). Such is all this; all this art thou.\u2019 So he says to him. This is laid down in a verse. (6.)\n\n\u2018The indestructible, which has the Yajus as belly, the S\u0101man as head, the Rc as form, he should be known as Brahman, the \u1e5a\u1e63i, composed of Brahman, the great one.\u2019\n\nHe says to him, \u2018How dost thou obtain my male names?\u2019 \u2018By breath,\u2019 he should reply. \u2018How female names?\u2019 \u2018By\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \u015ar\u0101\u1e45ya is the usual brachylogy of \u2018head (and feet),\u2019 I think. So Max M\u00fcller, with Cowell. Max M\u00fcller takes \u012br\u0101 as \u2018earth.\u2019\n\n\\(^2\\) So probably tantu, being used in Atharva, xv, 3, 6. \u2018Cornices,\u2019 Cowell with \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda; \u2018L\u00e4ngsborten\u2019 and \u2018Querborten,\u2019 Deussen; \u2018Aufzug\u2019 and \u2018Einschlag,\u2019 Weber; \u2018sheets,\u2019 Max M\u00fcller.\n\n\\(^3\\) I read upa\u015braya\u1e25 (udgithop\u0101, an irregular Sandhi). The upa\u015br\u012b\u1e25 of the scholiast, though accepted by Max M\u00fcller and Whitney (on Atharva, xv, 3, 8), is merely a dittograph of \u015br\u012b following. Cowell\u2019s udgi\u1e6dho \u2019para\u015b ca yath with his MSS. and my Berlin and Bodleian MSS. is a corruption of an unknown word. Possibly upa\u015braya\u1e25, as in Atharva, l.c., may be correct. The rendering given is Whitney\u2019s; \u2018coverlet,\u2019 Cowell, Deussen, Max M\u00fcller, Weber, and Lexx. Cf. v, 1.\n\n\\(^4\\) Bh\u0101ry\u0101yai is supported by my MSS., and must be right; bh\u0101yai of \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda is impossible. The version above agrees with that of Cowell and Deussen in substance. Max M\u00fcller has \u2018sprung from the womb of endless space, from the light (from the luminous Brahman). The light, the origin of the year, which is the past, which is the present, which is all living things, and all elements is the Self,\u2019 but despairs of the original reading, unnecessarily it seems, for bh\u0101yai is an easy error for bh\u0101ry\u0101yai, and the other variant etat not difficult for retas.\n\n\\(^5\\) The Berlin MS. actually has ekay\u0101.\n\n\\(^6\\) Not in Bloomfield, Vedic Concordance. Yaj\u016b\u1e0darah is noteworthy and early in character.\nspeech.' 'How neuter (names)?' 'By mind.' 'How scents?' 'By smell.'1 'How forms?' 'By the eye.' 'How sounds?' 'By the ear.' 'How the savour of food?' 'By the tongue.' 'How actions?' 'By the hands.' 'How pleasure and pain?' 'By the body.' 'How joy, dalliance, offspring?' 'By the organ of generation.' 'How moving?' 'By the feet.' 'How thoughts, what is to be known, desires?' 'By intelligence alone,' he should reply. To him he says, 'The waters indeed are my world, this is thine.' What victory, what success, Brahman has, he wins that victory, he attains that success, who knows this. (7.)\n\nAdhy\u0101ya IV.\n\n'Breath is Brahman,' says Kau\u1e63itaki. Of this breath which is Brahman the mind is the messenger, the eye the protector, the ear the proclaimer, speech the tirewoman. He who knows mind as the messenger of this breath which is Brahman becomes possessed of the messenger, eye as the protector becomes possessed of the protector, ear as the proclaimer becomes possessed of the proclaimer, speech as the tirewoman becomes possessed of the tirewoman. To this breath which is Brahman all these deities, unasked, pay homage; so to him who knows this all beings, unasked, pay homage. His secret rule2 is, 'One must not beg.' Just as one having begged through a village without getting anything sits down, (saying), 'I would not eat anything given from this (place),' then those who formerly refused him invite him, thus is the rule of him who begs not. The givers of food invite him, (saying), 'We give.' (1.)\n\n'Breath is Brahman,' so says Paingya. Of this breath which\n\n---\n\n1 Pr\u0101na and ghr\u0101\u1e47a are so alike in Devan\u0101gar\u012b that one need have little hesitation in accepting here ghr\u0101\u1e47a with Cowell's MS. A, the Berlin and Bodleian MSS., though pr\u0101\u1e47a could mean 'smell,' and frequently is used decisively in that sense, especially when a verbal form of pr\u0101\u1e47 is used. S\u0101\u1e45kar\u0101nanda adds (so Weber, but not Anquetil) after the eye, touch and the skin.\n\n2 Such a use is decidedly against Oldenberg's theory of the meaning of upani\u1e63ad as 'worship.' Cf. Deussen, Phil. of the Upanishads, p. 13, and see Oldenberg's articles, Z.D.M.G., I, 457, and liv, 70. Parive\u1e63\u1e6dri is rendered 'housekeeper' by Max M\u00fcller; 'waitress' by Deussen.\nis Brahman after speech the eye envelops; after the eye the ear envelops; after the ear the mind envelops; after the mind breath envelops.\\(^1\\) To this breath which is Brahman all these deities, unasked, pay homage; so to him who knows this all beings, unasked, pay homage. His secret rule is, \u2018One must not beg.\u2019 Just as one having begged through a village without getting anything sits down, (saying), \u2018I would not eat anything given from this (place),\u2019 then those who formerly refused him invite him, thus is the rule of him who begs not. The givers of food invite him, (saying), \u2018We give.\u2019 (2.)\n\nThen follows the obtaining of a choice portion of wealth. If a man desire a choice portion of wealth, on the night of full or new moon or in the bright fortnight under\\(^2\\) an auspicious Nak\u1e63atra, on one of these seasons, he places the fire, sweeps round, scatters (grass) about, sprinkles (water), purifies (the ghee),\\(^3\\) and bending his right knee offers oblations of ghee with a ladle. \u2018The deity, speech by name, is the obtainer. May she obtain this for me from N. N. To her sv\u0101h\u0101. The deity, smell\\(^4\\) by name, is the obtainer. May he obtain this for me from N. N. To him sv\u0101h\u0101. The deity, the eye by name, is the obtainer. May it obtain this for me from N. N. To it sv\u0101h\u0101. The deity, the ear by name, is the obtainer. May it obtain this for me from N. N. To it sv\u0101h\u0101. The deity, mind by name, is the obtainer. May it obtain this for me from N. N. To it sv\u0101h\u0101. The deity, intelligence by name, is the obtainer. May she obtain this for me from N. N. To her sv\u0101h\u0101.\u2019\n\nThen, having inhaled the fragrance of the smoke, and having\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This appears the best rendering of the somewhat doubtful text, \u0101rundhate being a 3rd sing. from a by-form of rudh. The reading of \u015a\u0101\u1e45kar\u0101nanda and Max M\u00fcller, \u0101rundhe, may be dismissed as a facile conjecture, and Cowell\u2019s conjecture, \u0101rudhyate, is not necessary. For the sense, cf. Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad, ii. Max M\u00fcller renders \u2018stands firm behind,\u2019 and reads \u015brotaparast\u0101t, which, though not essential, is very probable.\n\n\\(^2\\) The absence of v\u0101 after nak\u1e63atre suggests three seasons (parvan), each to have an auspicious Nak\u1e63atra. \u015a\u0101\u1e45kar\u0101nanda thinks there are four, the dark half being a vikalpa! Cowell gives four, Deussen three.\n\n\\(^3\\) Omitted by accident in Cowell\u2019s text. \u015a\u0101\u1e45kar\u0101nanda\u2019s recension has \u2018with a ladle, camasa, or kamasa.\u2019 Cf. B\u1e5bhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad, vi, 3; infra, xii, 8, for the ritual.\n\n\\(^4\\) Possibly ghr\u0101\u1e47o should be read, the unusual gender helping the alteration to pr\u0101\u1e47o. Similarly, in iv, 4.\nanointed his limbs with ghee, he should go forth, restraining his speech, and declare his desire (to the man in question), or send a messenger. He then obtains it.\\(^1\\) (3.)\n\nThen follows the divine desire. If a man desire to be dear to any man or woman, or men or women, on one of these seasons, he places a fire and offers in the same manner oblations of ghee. 'Thy speech I offer in myself here, st\u0101h\u0101. Thy smell I offer in myself here, sv\u0101h\u0101. Thine eye I offer in myself here, sv\u0101h\u0101. Thine ear I offer in myself here, sv\u0101h\u0101. Thy mind I offer in myself here, sv\u0101h\u0101.' Then, having inhaled the fragrance of the smoke, and having anointed his limbs with ghee, he should go forth, restraining his speech, and should seek to place himself in contact (with the object of his desire), or should stand in his wind addressing him. He indeed becomes beloved; of him they have desire. (4.)\n\nThen follows the restraint of Pratardana.\\(^2\\) They call it the inner Agnihotra. So long as a man speaks, so long he cannot breathe. Then he offers breath in speech. So long as a man breathes, so long he cannot speak. Then he offers speech in breath. These eternal, immortal, oblations he ever offers, awake or asleep. Again, other oblations are not eternal, for they are compact of action. Therefore ancient sages did not offer the (ordinary) Agnihotra. (5.)\n\n'The hymn is Brahman,' so says \u015au\u1e63kabhr\u016bg\u0101ra. Let him worship it as Rc. All beings, indeed, are won by worship\\(^3\\) for his excellence. Let him worship it as Yajus. All beings indeed, are yoked to him for his excellence. Let him worship it as S\u0101man. All beings, indeed, bow to him for his excellence. Let him worship it as prosperity. Let him worship it as glory. Let him worship it as splendour. Just\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This and the next chapter are curious examples of sympathetic magic, of which the Vedic ritual is so full. Cf. Caland, *Altindisches Zauberritual*; Bloomfield, *S.B.E.*, xlii; and with iv, 4, S\u0101mavidh\u0101na Br\u0101hm\u0101na, ii, 5; 6.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf. Kaus\u012btaki Br\u0101hm\u0101na, xxvi, 5, for him as a teacher. The similarity of 1 Cor. x, 31, cited by Deussen is not obvious.\n\n\\(^3\\) Sa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda renders as active, and so Cowell; 'Zujauchzen gemacht,' Deussen; 'will praise him,' Max M\u00fcller, who renders also below 'will join before him.' The Berlin MS. has *abhyaarcante*.\nas it is among the \u015a\u0101stras\\(^1\\) the most prosperous, glorious, and splendid, so among all creatures he who knows this becomes the most prosperous, glorious, and splendid. The Adhvaryu prepares the self to be connected with sacrifice\\(^2\\) and compact of work. In it he weaves what is compact of the Yajus. In what is compact of the Yajus, the Hot\u1e5b weaves what is compact of the Rc; in what is compact of the Rc, the Udg\u0101\u1e6dr weaves what is compact of the S\u0101man. He is the soul of the threefold knowledge; he is the soul of Indra,\\(^3\\) who knows this. (6.)\n\nThen follow the three meditations of Sarvajit\\(^4\\) Kau\u1e63\u012btaki. Sarvajit Kau\u1e63\u012btaki adores the rising sun, having put on the sacrificial thread, and having brought water, and having thrice sprinkled the cup of water, (saying), \u2018Thou art the scatterer; scatter away my sins.\u2019 In the same manner (he adores him) at the zenith, (saying), \u2018Thou art the utter scatterer; utterly scatter away my sins.\u2019 In the same manner (he adores him) at his setting, (saying), \u2018Thou art the complete scatterer; completely scatter away my sins.\u2019 Thus, whatever evil by day or night he does, this he scatters completely.\\(^5\\) Therefore, he who knows this in this manner adores the sun. Whatever evil he does by day or night, this he scatters completely. (7.)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \u2018Weapon,\u2019 \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda, followed by Cowell and Max M\u00fcller, forgetting that the \u0100ranyaka treats of this very \u015a\u0101stra. Cf. Eggeling, S.B.E., xli, p. xiv.\n\n\\(^2\\) \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda reads and translates ai\u1e63\u1e6dakam; hence Cowell\u2019s version, \u2018connected with the sacrificial bricks.\u2019 For the sense, cf. i, 1; Aitareya \u0100ranyaka, ii, 1\u20133; Deussen, Allgem. Gesch. der Phil., i, 328.\n\n\\(^3\\) Max M\u00fcller takes this differently. He translates above, \u2018conceives the fire of the altar, which is used for the sacrifice, to be himself. In it he (the Adhvaryu) weaves,\u2019 and adopts the text of \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda\u2019s recension, slightly modified, sa esa sarvasyai trayyai vidy\u0101ya \u0101tm\u0101, esa u ev\u0101sy\u0101tm\u0101. \u0112tad\u0101tm\u0101 bhavati ya evam veda, \u2018He (the Adhvaryu or pr\u0101\u1e47a) is the self of the threefold knowledge; he indeed is the self of it (of pr\u0101\u1e47a).\u2019 He who knows this is the self of it (becomes pr\u0101\u1e47a).\u2019 \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda himself takes asya as ukt\u0101y\u0101s trayyai.\n\n\\(^4\\) I think this must be a proper name, though \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda does not so take it, and is followed by Cowell, Max M\u00fcller, and Deussen. But see Weber, Ind. Stud., i, 404. The use of the sacrificial cord is noteworthy; Max M\u00fcller compares Taittir\u012bya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, iii, 10, 9, 12. For varga, cf. Hillebrandt, Ved. Myth., iii, 271.\n\n\\(^5\\) Omitted in \u0100nand. ed. Akarot is curious; see p. xiv.\nThen on every month, on\\(^1\\) the night of new moon, let him adore the moon when it is seen in the west in the same manner, or let him throw towards it two blades of young grass,\\(^2\\) (saying), 'That fair heart of mine resting in the moon in the sky, I deem myself to know. May I never weep for misfortune to my children.' His children\\(^3\\) die not before him. This (is the rite) for one who has a son. Then follows that for one who has no son. Having recited the three verses,\\(^4\\) 'Do thou wax great, be thou united,' 'May thy draughts, may my strengths be united,' 'The drop which the \u0100dityas make to swell,' he revolves round his right arm, (saying), 'Increase not by our lives, children, and cattle; he who hates us and whom we hate, increase by his life, children, and cattle. So I turn the turning of Indra; so I re-turn the turning of \u0100ditya.'\\(^5\\) (8.)\n\nThen on the night of full moon, let him adore the moon when seen in the east\\(^6\\) in the same manner, (saying), 'Soma, the king, art thou, the wise, the five-mouthed, Praj\u0101pati. The Br\u0101hma\u1e47a is one of thy mouths. With that mouth thou dost eat kings. With that mouth make me an eater of food. The king is one of thy mouths. With that mouth thou eatest the folk.\\(^7\\) With that mouth make me an eater of food. The hawk is one of thy mouths. With that mouth thou eatest\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The scholiast's recension reads only 'on,' omitting v\u1e5btt\u0101y\u0101m, which, however, need only mean 'having come,' as Deussen takes it.\n\n\\(^2\\) In that recension is read 'he shoots his voice in a blade of grass.' In the verse Deussen suggests sus\u012bme (voc.); Max M\u00fcller follows \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda in reading te sus\u012bmam h\u1e5bdayam adhi candramasi \u015br\u012btam ten\u0101\u1e41rtasye\u015b\u0101ne, as in iv, 10; cf. J.A.O.S., xiii, p. cxx.\n\n\\(^3\\) I read p\u016brv\u0101 pra\u1e47\u0101. The plural is quite impossible in a case like this. So in iv, 10.\n\n\\(^4\\) RV., i, 91, 16 (= ix, 31, 4); 18; Taittir\u012bya Sa\u1e41hit\u0101, ii, 3, 5, 3; iv, 14, 1. Cf. also Atharva Veda, vii, 81, 6.\n\n\\(^5\\) i.e. the pradak\u1e63ina, from west to east; cf. Caland & Henry, L'Agni\u1e63\u1e6doma, p. xxxvii. In iv, 9, from east to west, Varuna being in the west. Indra's connection with the sun is noteworthy; cf. Hillebrandt, Ved. Myth., iii, 158 seq.; 207, n. 2; and for this passage, ibid., p. 280, n. 2; Caland, Een Indogerm. Lustatiegebruik, p. 10.\n\n\\(^6\\) In view of pa\u015bc\u0101t in iv, 8, this must be the sense. 'In front,' \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda followed by Cowell.\n\n\\(^7\\) This recurrent phrase in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a texts is a clear reference to the king's right of maintenance by the common people; cf. Foy, Die K\u00f6nigliche Gewalt, p. 41.\nbirds. With that mouth make me an eater of food. The fire is one of thy mouths. With that mouth thou eatest this world. With that mouth make me an eater of food. In thyself is the fifth mouth. With that mouth thou eatest all creatures. With that mouth make me an eater of food. Do not diminish\\(^1\\) with our lives, children, and cattle; he who hates us and whom we hate, diminish with his life, children, and cattle. So I turn the turning of the gods. So I re-turn the turning of \u0100ditya.\\(^2\\) So (saying), he revolves round his right arm. \\((9.)\\)\n\nThen, when he consorts\\(^3\\) with his wife, let him touch her heart, (saying), \u2018What in thy fair heart rests within Praj\u0101pati (the moon), through that, O mistress of immortality, mayst thou never weep for misfortune to thy children.\u2019 Her children die not before her. \\((10.)\\)\n\nThen, when coming back after absence, he should smell\\(^4\\) the head of his son, (saying),\\(^5\\) \u2018From each limb art thou born; from the heart thou dost spring; self indeed is thy name, son; live thou a hundred autumns, N. N.\u2019 So he utters his name. \u2018Be\\(^6\\) thou a stone; be an axe; be\\(^7\\) gold indestructible; splendour indeed is thy name, son; live thou a hundred autumns, N. N.\u2019 So he utters his name. Then he embraces him (saying\\(^8\\)), \u2018Even as Praj\u0101pati embraced creatures for their\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) As in iv, 8, we must reject Sa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda\u2019s version, adopted by Cowell, which ignores the reference to the moon\u2019s waxing and waning, and renders \u2018gladden (us)\u2019 and \u2018destroy (us)\u2019 or \u2018our enemy\u2019 respectively, a construction rendered impossible by the form of the relative clause alone. The difference in the ideas is remarkable, though not contradictory; lives are instruments in the first case, objects of comparison in the second; cf. Deussen, Phil. of the Upanishads, p. 218, n. 7; Sechzig Upanishad\u2019s, pp. 34, 35. For the destruction of the world, cf. Deussen, Phil. of the Upanishads, pp. 219 seq.\n\n\\(^2\\) Read probably samv\u0113\u1e63ya\u1e47 (fourth class from vi\u1e63), or \u1e6dvek\u1e63ya\u1e47, as suggested by Deussen. In the verse sus\u012bme may be voc., as Deussen takes it. The Berlin MS. has h\u1e5bdayam. Sa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda mentions the v.l. manye \u2018ham m\u0101\u1e41 tadvidv\u0101\u1e41sa\u1e41 m\u0101ham, and reads na h\u0101sm\u0101t; cf. iv, 8.\n\n\\(^3\\) See Hopkins, J.A.O.S., xxviii, 120\u201334, an amusing and important sketch.

This\\(^5\\) Brahman (n.) shines forth when the fire blazes. Then it dies when the fire blazes not. Its splendour goes to the sun, its breath to the wind.

Then it dies when one does not hear. Its splendour goes to the mind, its breath to the breath. This Brahman shines when one thinks by the mind. Then it dies when one does not think. Its splendour goes to the breath, its breath to the breath. All these deities indeed, having entered the breath, having died in the breath, die not. Therefore they arise again. Thus even if the two mountains,\u00b9 the south and the north, should advance against one who knows this eager to destroy him, they would destroy him not. But those who hate him and whom he himself hates die round him. (13.)\n\nThen follows the gaining of pre-eminence.\u00b2 These deities, disputing on their pre-eminence, went forth from this body. Then it lay, without breath, dry, a mere log. Then speech entered it, and it spoke, but still lay. Then the eye entered it, but it lay, speaking with speech, seeing with the eye. Then the ear entered it, but it lay, speaking with speech, seeing with the eye, hearing with the ear. Then mind entered it, but it lay, speaking with speech, seeing with the eye, hearing with the ear, thinking with mind. Then breath entered it. Then it arose. Then all the deities, recognising the superiority of breath, having entered\u00b3 into breath, the intellectual self, went forth from the body with all these\u2074 (organs). They entered into the wind, and, identified with the ether, went to heaven. Even so a man who knows this, recognising the pre-eminence of breath, having entered into breath, the intellectual self, goes forth from the body with all these (organs). He enters into the wind, and, identified with the ether, goes to heaven. He goes then where the gods are. As the gods became immortal, so does he become immortal who knows this. (14.)\n\n\u00b9 Written in the Madhyade\u015ba, but we need not suppose, with Weber, Ind. Stud., i, 408, before the South was known. Cf. on Aitareya \u0100ranyak\u0101, ii, 1, 1.\n\n\u00b2 Cf. v, 3; ix; Brhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad, vi, 2, 7\u201315; Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad, v, 1, 6\u201312; Aitareya \u0100ranyak\u0101, ii, 1, 4; 4, 3; Pra\u015bna Upani\u1e63ad, ii, 2\u20134; Deussen, Phil. of the Upanishads, pp. 104, 105. I agree with his estimate of the place of the Kausitaki, but not of the Aitareya.\n\n\u00b3 This is the sense of abhisambh\u0101, not \u2018honoured,\u2019 as Cowell; \u2018comprehended,\u2019 Max M\u00fcller. \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda has v\u0101yu prat\u012bsth\u0101\u1e25.\n\n\u2074 Scil. indriyai\u1e25, over which the deities preside; the five Pr\u0101\u1e47as, \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda, Deussen, and Max M\u00fcller.\nThen follows the tradition from father to son. Thus do they set it forth. The father, when about to die, calls for his son. After strewing the house with fresh grass, and laying the fire, and placing a pot of water with a jar (of rice), he lies clothed in a new garment. The son comes and approaches him from above, having touched all his organs with his own. Or he may perform the tradition for (his son) seated in front of him. 'My speech I will place in thee,' says the father. 'Thy speech I place in me,' says the son. 'My breath' I will place in thee,' says the father. 'Thy breath I place in me,' says the son. 'Mine eye I will place in thee,' says the father. 'Thine eye I place in me,' says the son. 'Mine ear I will place in thee,' says the father. 'Thine ear I place in me,' says the son. 'My savour of food I will place in thee,' says the father. 'Thy savour of food I place in me,' says the son. 'My deeds I will place in thee,' says the father. 'Thy deeds I place in me,' says the son. 'My good and evil hap I will place in thee,' says the father. 'Thy good and evil hap I place in me,' says the son. 'My joy, dalliance, and offspring I will place in thee,' says the father. 'Thy joy, dalliance, and offspring I place in me,' says the son. 'My going I will place in thee,' says the father. 'Thy going I place in me,' says the son. 'My mind' I will place in thee,' says the father. 'Thy mind I place in me,' says the son. 'Mine intelligence I will place in thee,' says the father. 'Thine intelligence I place in me,' says the son. If then he should be very ill, he should speak summarily. 'My breaths I will place in thee,' says the father. 'Thy breaths I place in me,' says the son. Then, after going round his father with his right side towards him, he departs. His father cries after him, 'May glory, holiness, suitable food, and fame attend thee.' Then the other looks back over his left shoulder hiding (his face) with his hand or covering it with the hem of his\n\n1 No doubt in the sense of 'smell.' Ghr\u0101\u1e47am is possible. For the whole, cf. Brhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad, i, 5, 25 seq. (= 17 seq. K.).\n\n2 The scholiast's recension reads dhiyo vij\u00f1\u0101tavyam k\u0101m\u0101n (as in iii, 7), and omits the rest down to atha. That recension also makes the father approach the son, while Cowell's MS. A adds after 'deeds' 'the body.'\n\n3 Omitted in Cowell's text.\ngarment, (saying), 'Obtain the worlds of heaven, thy desires.' If the father recover, let him live in his son's control, or let him wander about (as an ascetic). If, however, he die, let them provide for him, as he should be provided for.\\(^1\\) (15.)\n\n**Adhy\u0101ya V.**\n\nPratardana Daivod\u0101si went to Indra's loved abode through war and courage. Indra said to him, 'Pratardana, choose a boon.' Pratardana said, 'Do thou choose for me what boon thou thinkest best for man.' Indra said to him, 'The superior\\(^2\\) chooses not for the inferior. Choose thyself.' 'Then hast thou no boon\\(^3\\) for me,' said Pratardana. Then Indra deviated not from truth, for Indra is truth. Indra said to him, 'Me only know. That I deem best for man that he should know me. The offspring of Tv\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dr,\\(^4\\) the three-headed, I slew; I gave to the wolves the devotees, the Arunmukhas; breaking many a compact, I crushed the Prahl\u0101d\u012byas in heaven, the Paulomas in the atmosphere, the K\u0101lak\u0101\u00f1jas on the earth, and then not a hair of me was harmed. He who knows me, his life to come is harmed by no deed whatsoever, neither by theft, nor slaying the babe unborn,\\(^5\\) nor by slaying his mother,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The reference is, I think, to the funeral rites, as taken by Max M\u00fcller. Cowell renders 'receive the tradition'; Deussen, 'the powers of the father take possession of him.' \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda seems to have read enam sam\u0101payati.\n\n\\(^2\\) The scholiast's recension has varah parasmai, and the Berlin MS. has vuro parasmai. The true reading is, I think, not varo varasmai, but varo parasmai.\n\n\\(^3\\) Deussen inverts the names Indra and Pratardana, and so can render 'thou art lower than I' possible in Indra's mouth. Cowell gives as alternatives, 'Let not the inferior choose' and 'Let not the boon become no boon.' Max M\u00fcller has, 'No one who chooses, chooses for another; choose thyself . . . that boon to choose is no boon for me.' I take meti as an irregular contraction for ma iti; cf. udgithop\u0101\u00b0 in iii, 5. A-vara must, I think, contain a reference to some appeal to Indra's love of truth; hence my rendering.\n\n\\(^4\\) For the following, cf. S\u0101yana on RV., v, 34, 4; Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, vii, 28; and other passages in Weber, *Ind. Stud.*, i, 410 seq.; iii, 464, 465; xiii, 191 seq. The mythological sense, if any, is hopelessly lost, except in the case of Tv\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, Macdonell, *Vedic Mythology*, p. 160. Indra's kilbis\u0101ni are famed in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a period. The Berlin MS. has aru\u016bmukh\u016bn.\n\n\\(^5\\) Not 'slaying a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a,' as Weber, Cowell, with the scholiast, and Max M\u00fcller. The scholiast's recension has a clause more.\nnor by slaying his father. Nor when he has done evil does the bloom leave his face.' (1.)\n\nHe said, 'I am breath. Worship me as the intelligent self, as life, as immortality. Life is breath; breath is life, for as long as breath dwells in the body, so long does life. For by breath he obtains immortality in this world, by intelligence, truth, and will. He, who worships me as life and immortality, enjoys full length of days in this world and obtains immortality and imperishableness in the world of heaven.' Some say, 'The breaths become one. For else no one could at one time make known a name by speech, a form by the eye, a sound by the ear, a thought by the mind. The breaths having become one make known all these one by one. When speech speaks, all the breaths speak after it; when the eye sees, all the breaths see after it; when the ear hears, all the breaths hear after it; when the mind thinks, all the breaths think after it; when the breath breathes, all the breaths breathe after it.' 'Even so it is,' said Indra; 'there is, however, a highest of the breaths.' (2.)\n\nOne lives though deprived of speech, for we see the dumb. One lives though deprived of sight, for we see the blind. One lives though deprived of hearing, for we see the deaf. One lives though deprived of mind, for we see infants. One lives though one's arms are lost, or when one's legs are lost, for we see it so. Breath alone is the intelligent self.\n\n---\n\n1 *Veti* cannot be correct, for *vi* does not mean 'go away.' Read *vyeti* as in Taittir\u012bya Sanhita, iii, 1, 1, 2, *n\u0101sy\u0101 nilam na haro vyeti*. The *cakru\u1e63o* of \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda and the edd. is impossible. The Berlin MS. has *cak\u1e63u\u1e63o*, and the correct reading is obviously *cakru\u1e63o*; so Deussen and two of the \u0100nand. MSS. The Berlin MS. adds *can\u0101*. The substantial immorality of this doctrine remains a fatal difficulty in Ved\u0101ntism as in the S\u0101\u1e43khya.\n\n2 The scholiast's recension reads 'in the other'; so Max M\u00fcller. That recension has, 'Breath is life, breath too is immortality,' which Max M\u00fcller adopts and expands.\n\n3 'True resolve,' Cowell; 'true knowledge,' Deussen and Max M\u00fcller.\n\n4 \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda makes Pratardana commence here to speak. This seems unnecessary, though adopted by Cowell, Deussen, and Max M\u00fcller, who at the end suggests *pr\u0101\u1e47asya* for the plural, but it is not necessary.\n\n5 Apparently a reference to mutilation as a punishment. Cf. Hopkins, *J.A.O.S.*, xiii, 134. The 'mind' sentence is omitted in the scholiast's recension in some MSS.\nEncompassing the body it raises it up; therefore should one worship it as the hymn\u00b9 (uktha). Thus is everything to be won in breath. What breath is, that is intelligence; what intelligence is, that is breath. This is its insight, its true knowledge. When then a man in sleep dreams no dreams, then his breath becomes one;\u00b2 then speech with all names enters it; sight with all forms enters it; hearing with all sounds enters it; mind with all thoughts enters it. When he awakes, just as from a burning fire sparks leap to all the quarters, so from that self the breaths rise up according to their places; from the breaths the deities arise; from the deities the worlds. This breath\u00b3 alone is the intelligent self. Encompassing the body it raises it up; therefore should one worship it as the hymn. Thus is everything to be won in breath. What breath is, that is intelligence; what intelligence is, that is breath. This is its insight, its true knowledge. When then a man, ill, on the point of death, and very weak, falls into a faint, they say, \u2018His thought has departed; he hears not, he sees not, he speaks not, he thinks not.\u2019 Then his breath becomes one; then speech with all names enters it; sight with all forms enters it; hearing with all sounds enters it; mind with all thoughts enters it. When he leaves the body he leaves it with all of these. (3.)\n\nSpeech and all names are deposited in him. By speech he obtains all names. Smell\u2074 and all odours are deposited in him. By smell he obtains all odours. Sight and all forms are deposited in him. By sight he obtains all forms. Hearing and all sounds are deposited in him. By hearing he obtains all sounds. Mind and all thoughts are deposited in him.\n\n\u00b9 Uktha from ut-th\u0101payati. The reference is, of course, to the Mahad Uktha of i and ii.\n\u00b2 Or \u2018he becomes one in breath\u2019; cf. vi, 20; S.B.E., xlviii, 378 seq. So Cowell, Deussen, and Max M\u00fcller (doubtfully). The scholiast\u2019s recension omits in the beginning of the sentence \u2018This . . . breath,\u2019 and adds \u2018They dwell together and depart together; this is its insight.\u2019\n\u00b3 Omitted in the scholiast\u2019s recension.\n\u2074 The usual variation in MSS. between pr\u0101\u1e47a and ghr\u0101\u1e47a. \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda has, \u2018Speech dismisses all names,\u2019 etc., and he inserts above, \u2018When he awakes,\u2019 etc., over again. Max M\u00fcller has, \u2018Speech gives up\u2019 or \u2018takes away\u2019 all names.\nBy mind he obtains all thoughts. Together\\(^1\\) they dwell in the body; together they depart.\n\nNow we will explain how all beings become one for this intelligence. (4.)\n\nSpeech is taken out\\(^2\\) as one portion of it; to correspond with it a rudimentary element, the name, was placed outside. Smell was taken out as one portion of it; to correspond with it a rudimentary element, the odour, was placed outside. Sight was taken out as one portion of it; to correspond with it a rudimentary element, form, was placed outside. Hearing was taken out as one portion of it; to correspond with it a rudimentary element, sound, was placed outside. The tongue was taken out as one portion of it; to correspond with it a rudimentary element, the savour of food, was placed outside. The hands were taken out as one portion of it; to correspond with them a rudimentary element, action, was placed outside. The body was taken out as one portion of it; to correspond with it a rudimentary element, pleasure and pain, was placed outside. The organ was taken out as one portion of it; to correspond with it a rudimentary element, joy, dalliance, and offspring, was placed outside. The feet were taken out as one portion of it; to correspond with them a rudimentary element, motion, was placed outside. Mind\\(^3\\) was taken out as one portion of it; to correspond with it a rudimentary element, thought and desires, was placed outside. (5.)\n\nHaving mounted on speech with intelligence, he obtains, through speech, all names. Having mounted on smell with intelligence, he obtains, through smell, all odours. Having mounted on sight with intelligence, he obtains, through sight,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This is preceded in the scholiast's recension by 'Thus is everything to be won in breath. What breath is, that is intelligence. What intelligence is, that is breath.' Cf. v, 3.\n\n\\(^2\\) We must read ud\u016blham (as Deussen and Max M\u00fcller) or ad\u016bduhat throughout (cf. J.R.A.S., 1908, p. 388). There seem to have been early two readings, ud\u016blham and ad\u016bduhat, and possibly the second is merely a gloss on the first. Ad\u016blham is a meaningless contamination. The sense is, from intelligence come the five organs (=their activities, the two being identified) and their objects.\n\n\\(^3\\) The scholiast's recension has, 'Intelligence as one part was taken out from it; to correspond with it a rudimentary element, thought, what is to be known, desires, was placed outside.'\nall forms. Having mounted on hearing with intelligence, he obtains, through hearing, all sounds. Having mounted on the tongue with intelligence, he obtains, through the tongue, all the savour of food. Having mounted on the hands with intelligence, he obtains, through the hands, all actions. Having mounted on the body with intelligence, he obtains, through the body, pleasure and pain. Having mounted on the organ with intelligence, he obtains, through the organ, joy, dalliance, and offspring. Having mounted on the feet with intelligence, he obtains, through the feet, motions. Having mounted on the mind\\(^1\\) with intelligence, he obtains through the mind, all thoughts. (6.)\n\nFor, bereft of intelligence, speech could not make known any name. \u2018My mind has been somewhere else,\u2019 it says, \u2018I have not perceived that name.\u2019 For, bereft of intelligence, smell could not make known any odour. \u2018My mind has been somewhere else,\u2019 it says, \u2018I have not perceived that odour.\u2019 For, bereft of intelligence, sight could not make known any form. \u2018My mind has been somewhere else,\u2019 it says, \u2018I have not perceived any form.\u2019 For, bereft of intelligence, hearing could not make known any sound. \u2018My mind has been somewhere else,\u2019 it says, \u2018I have not perceived that sound.\u2019 For, bereft of intelligence, the tongue could not make known any savour of food. \u2018My mind has been somewhere else,\u2019 it says, \u2018I have not perceived that savour of food.\u2019 For, bereft of intelligence, the hands could not make known any action. \u2018Our mind has been somewhere else,\u2019 they\\(^2\\) say, \u2018we have not perceived that action.\u2019 For, bereft of intelligence, the body could not make known any\\(^3\\) pleasure or pain. \u2018My mind has been somewhere else,\u2019 it says, \u2018I have not perceived pleasure or pain.\u2019 For, bereft of intelligence, the organ could not make known any joy, dalliance, or offspring. \u2018My mind has been somewhere else,\u2019 it says, \u2018I have not perceived joy, dalliance, or offspring.\u2019\n\n\\(^1\\) \u015a\u0101\u1e45kar\u0101nanda has, \u2018Mounting on thoughts with intelligence, he obtains, through intelligence, thoughts, what is to be known, desires.\u2019\n\n\\(^2\\) \u015a\u0101\u1e45kar\u0101nanda keeps throughout the singular, \u2018One says,\u2019 and Deussen and Max M\u00fcller follow him.\n\n\\(^3\\) The \\(na\\) inserted in Cowell\u2019s MS. D is not necessary.\nFor, bereft of intelligence, the feet could not make known any motion. 'Our mind has been somewhere else,' they say, 'we have not perceived motion.' For, bereft of intelligence, no thought could be complete, nor what is to be known be known. (7.)\n\nOne should not seek to know speech, but the speaker one should know. One should not seek to know the odour, but the smeller one should know. One should not seek to know form, but the seer one should know. One should not wish to know sound, but the hearer one should know. One should not wish to know the savour of food, but the knower of the savour of food one should know. One should not seek to know the act, but the actor one should know. One should not seek to know pleasure and pain, but the knower of pleasure and pain one should know. One should not seek to know joy, dalliance, and offspring, but the knower of joy, dalliance, and offspring one should know. One should not desire to know motion, but the mover one should know. One should not desire to know the mind, but the thinker one should know. These ten rudimentary elements indeed depend on intelligence. The ten rudiments of intelligence depend on the elements. For if there were not the rudimentary elements there would not be the rudiments of intelligence, or if there were not the rudiments of intelligence there would not be the rudimentary elements, for from neither of the two by itself could any form be made. Nor again are they separate. Just as the rim of a chariot wheel is placed on the spokes, and the spokes are placed on the nave, so these rudimentary elements are placed upon the rudiments of intelligence, and the rudiments of intelligence are placed upon the breath. This breath is the intelligent self, joy,\\(^1\\) unaging, immortal. It becomes not greater through a good deed, nor less through an evil deed. For him,\\(^2\\) indeed, it causes to do\n\n\\(^1\\) Cowell's MS. D has *anantah*, 'unending,' the usual variant. The use of the word in two quite different senses is strange, Deussen, *Phil. of the Upanishads*, p. 144, and the variant may be correct. In the Berlin MS. the *da* is added later.\n\n\\(^2\\) The scholiast's recension has, 'whom he wishes to draw after him; and whom he wishes to draw away from these worlds.'\ngood deeds whom it desires to lead forth from these worlds. Him again it causes to do evil deeds whom it seeks to plunge below. This is the guardian of the world, the lord of the world, the ruler of the world; this is my soul; this let a man know. (8.)\n\nAdhy\u0101ya VI.\n\nNow G\u0101rgya B\u0101l\u0101ki was famous\\(^1\\) as a student (of the Veda).

He went up to Aj\u0101ta\u015batru of K\u0101\u015b\u012b and said, \u2018Let me expound Brahman(n.) to thee.\u2019 To him said Aj\u0101ta\u015batru, \u2018\u201cWe give\\(^3\\) thee a thousand (cows),\u201d for that speech men run acclaiming, \u201cJanaka, Janaka.\u201d\u2019 (1.)\n\n(The spirit) in the sun, the great one; (the spirit) in the moon, food; (the spirit) in the lightning, truth; (the spirit) in the thunder-cloud, sound; (the spirit) in the wind, Indra Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha; (the spirit) in the ether, the full; (the spirit) in fire, the irresistible; (the spirit) in the waters, splendour; as regards the deities (these\\(^4\\) are the views as to Brahman of B\u0101l\u0101ki and Janaka respectively).

The Brhad\u0101ranyaka has a different and perhaps better reading as rendered by B\u00f6htlingk, \u2018We give a hundred cows for this speech, and people come around, saying, \u201c(A second) Janaka, (a second) Janaka.\u201d\u2019 So here Deussen has, \u2018I give you a thousand cows; when this is said, people come with the cry,\u2019 etc. Cowell has, \u2018I give thee one thousand cows for those words of thine.

Cowell omits it in his translation and renumbers the next sections.\nspirit) in sound, death; (the spirit) in sleep, Yama; (the spirit) in the body, Praj\u0101pati; (the spirit) in the right eye, (the self of speech; (the spirit) in the left eye, (the self) of truth. (2.)\n\nB\u0101l\u0101ki said, 'I worship him as the spirit in the sun.' Aj\u0101ta\u015batru said to him, 'Do not, do not make me talk\\(^1\\) of this. I worship him as the great one,\\(^2\\) clothed in white, pre-eminent, the head of all beings.' He who worships him thus becomes pre-eminent, the head of all beings. (3.)\n\nB\u0101l\u0101ki said, 'I worship him as the spirit in the moon.' Aj\u0101ta\u015batru said to him, 'Do not, do not, make me talk of this. I worship him as the self\\(^3\\) of food.' He who worships him thus becomes the self of food. (4.)\n\nB\u0101l\u0101ki said, 'I worship him as the spirit in the lightning.' Aj\u0101ta\u015batru said to him, 'Do not, do not, make me talk of this. I worship him as the self of truth.'\\(^4\\) He who worships him thus becomes the self of truth. (5.)\n\nB\u0101l\u0101ki said, 'I worship him as the spirit in the thunder-cloud.' Aj\u0101ta\u015batru said to him, 'Do not, do not, make me talk of this. I worship him as the self of sound.' He who worships him thus becomes the self of sound. (6.)\n\nB\u0101l\u0101ki\\(^5\\) said, 'I worship him as the spirit in the wind.'\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cowell renders, 'talk proudly'; Deussen, 'Thou shouldst not have called me to a discussion,' or, following the reading of the scholiast, samav\u0101dayi\u1e63\u1e6dha\u1e25, 'Thou shouldst not expect my agreement' (samav\u0101da). The latter rendering is impossible, and the former unduly presses the sense of the negative aorist. 'Do not challenge,' Max M\u00fcller, who points out that Aj\u0101ta\u015batru shows his knowledge by supplying the predicates. He does not, however, add the rewards, as Max M\u00fcller says, these being statements by the writer of the text. Eggeling suggests 'argue.'\n\n\\(^2\\) Read, of course, brhan p\u0101\u1e47\u1e0darav\u0101suh; brhat, though read even by Cowell and Max M\u00fcller, is nonsense, and t = n in most MSS. The scholiast's recension has b\u1e5bhan, so have the Berlin MS. (probably, but b\u1e5bhac in vi, 2) and B\u00f6htlingk's ed. of the Brhad\u0101ranyaka. The secondary character of the Kaus\u012btaki version appears in this definition, which in the prototype applies to the moon. P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dara is the reading of the Berlin MS., and may be kept, as in the scholiast's recension and the Brhad\u0101ranyaka.\n\n\\(^3\\) The scholiast's recension has, 'As Soma, the king,' etc. Cf. vi, 19; Brhad\u0101ranyaka, ii, 1, 3. Probably these words should be read here as Deussen does, with Max M\u00fcller.\n\n\\(^4\\) That recension has, 'the self of splendour' (read tejas\u0101 \u0101tm\u0101); so Max M\u00fcller.\n\n\\(^5\\) \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda's recension in some MSS. transposes sections 7 and 8.\nAj\u0101ta\u015batru said to him, 'Do not, do not, make me talk of this. I worship him as Indra Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha,\\(^1\\) the invincible host.' He who worships him thus becomes a conqueror, unconquerable by others, conquering others. (7.)\n\nB\u0101l\u0101ki said, 'I worship him as the spirit in the ether.' Aj\u0101ta\u015batru said to him, 'Do not, do not, make me talk of this. I worship him as the full and actionless\\(^2\\) Brahman(n.).' He who worships him thus is filled with children, health, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days.\\(^3\\) (8.)\n\nB\u0101l\u0101ki said, 'I worship him as the spirit in fire.' Aj\u0101ta\u015batru said to him, 'Do not, do not, make me talk of this. I worship him as the irresistible.' He who worships him thus becomes irresistible among others.\\(^4\\) (9.)\n\nB\u0101l\u0101ki said, 'I worship him as the spirit in the waters.' Aj\u0101ta\u015batru said to him, 'Do not, do not, make me talk of this. I worship him as the self of splendour.'\\(^5\\) He who worships him thus becomes the self of splendour.\n\nSo far as regards the deities. Now as regards the self. (10.)\n\nB\u0101l\u0101ki said, 'I worship him as the spirit in the mirror.' Aj\u0101ta\u015batru said to him, 'Do not, do not, make me talk of this. I worship him as the reflection.' He who worships him thus, a reflection of him is born among his offspring, not a counterfeit. (11.)\n\nB\u0101l\u0101ki\\(^6\\) said, 'I worship him as the spirit in the shadow.' Aj\u0101ta\u015batru said to him, 'Do not, do not, make me talk of this. I worship him as the second\\(^7\\) and inseparable.' He who worships him thus obtains (his desire) from the double. For he becomes double. (12.)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. Brhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka, ii, 1, 6, probably the earliest occurrence of the epithet.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf. Deussen, Phil. of the Upanishads, p. 20, n. 3.\n\n\\(^3\\) \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda has, 'is filled with children, cattle; neither he himself nor his children die before their time.'\n\n\\(^4\\) The scholiast's recension has anv esa for anyesa. All these clauses are not Aj\u0101ta\u015batru's as Cowell and Max M\u00fcller take them.\n\n\\(^5\\) That recension has, 'the self of a name' (n\u0101ma \u0101tm\u0101); so Max M\u00fcller.\n\n\\(^6\\) The scholiast's recension has these sections in the order 13, 14, 12, 16, 15.\n\n\\(^7\\) That recension has, 'as death,' etc., as in 14, ending 'neither he himself nor his children perish before their time.' Deussen's reading dvitiy\u0101n (apparently in Cowell's MSS. F, G, not in the scholiast) is probably correct; Max M\u00fcller renders with \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda, 'from the second (his wife).'\nB\u0101l\u0101ki said, 'I worship him as the spirit in the echo.' Aj\u0101ta\u015batru said to him, 'Do not, do not, make me talk of this. I worship him as life.'\u00b9 He who worships him thus does not faint before his time. (13.)\n\nB\u0101l\u0101ki said, 'I worship him as the spirit\u00b2 in sound.' Aj\u0101ta\u015batru said to him, 'Do not, do not, make me talk of this. I worship him as death.'\u00b3 He who worships him thus does not die before his time. (14.)\n\nB\u0101l\u0101ki said, 'I worship him who sleeping moves\u2074 in a dream.' Aj\u0101ta\u015batru said to him, 'Do not, do not, make me talk of this. I worship him as King Yama.' He who worships him thus, to him all this is subdued for his weal. (15.)\n\nB\u0101l\u0101ki said, 'I worship him as the spirit in the body.' Aj\u0101ta\u015batru said to him, 'Do not, do not, make me talk of this. I worship him as Praj\u0101pati.' He who worships him thus is multiplied in children, cattle,\u2075 glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days. (16.)\n\nB\u0101l\u0101ki said, 'I worship him as the spirit in the right eye.' Aj\u0101ta\u015batru said to him, 'Do not, do not, make me speak of this. I worship him as the self of speech,\u2076 the self of fire, the self of light.' He who worships him thus becomes the self of all these. (17.)\n\nB\u0101l\u0101ki said, 'I worship him as the spirit in the left eye.' Aj\u0101ta\u015batru said to him, 'Do not, do not, make me speak of this. I worship him as the self of truth, the self of the lightning, the self of splendour.' He who worships him thus becomes the self of all these. (18.)\u2077\n\n\u00b9 That recension has, 'as the second,' etc., as in 12.\n\u00b2 That recension has, 'who as sound follows the spirit.' So Max M\u00fcller, 'Nachrede,' Deussen.\n\u00b3 That recension has, 'as life,' etc., as in 13, ending 'neither he himself nor his children faint before their time.'\n\u2074 That recension has, 'I worship the intelligent self by which the sleeper moves in a dream.' So Max M\u00fcller. Whether the reading is svapnay\u0101ya (Cowell's MS. A, \u0100nand., the Berlin and Bodleian MSS.) or svapnay\u0101, the sense is the same, and Cowell's suggested svapnay \u0101carati is unnecessary.\n\u2075 That recension omits the rest as in vi, 8; so Max M\u00fcller.\n\u2076 The scholiast's recension has, 'of the name'; so Max M\u00fcller.\n\u2077 The sections 3\u201318 in that recension are numbered 2\u201317, as the resum\u00e9 in 2 occurs after 18 (17) joined on to 19 (18).\nThen held B\u0101l\u0101ki his peace. Aj\u0101ta\u015batru said to him, 'Thus far only, B\u0101l\u0101ki?' B\u0101l\u0101ki replied, 'Thus far only.' Aj\u0101ta\u015batru said to him, 'Make me not (again)\u00b9 to talk vainly, (saying), \"Let me teach thee Brahman(n.).\"' He who, B\u0101l\u0101ki, is the maker of these spirits, of whom this is the work, he it is who must be known.' Then B\u0101l\u0101ki came to him with fuel in hand, (saying), 'Let me approach thee.' Aj\u0101ta\u015batru said to him, 'Contrary to nature do I deem it that a K\u1e63atriya should instruct a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Yet come, I will instruct you.' Taking him by the hand he set forth. They came to a man asleep. Then Aj\u0101ta\u015batru hailed him,\u00b2 'O great one, clothed in white, Soma, the King.' He still lay (asleep\u00b3). He then touched him with his staff. He then rose up. Aj\u0101ta\u015batru said to him, 'Where, B\u0101l\u0101ki, has lain the spirit (asleep), where has this taken place, whence has this returned?' B\u0101l\u0101ki then did not know.\u2074 Aj\u0101ta\u015batru said to him, '(This is) where has lain the spirit (asleep), where this has taken place, whence this has returned. The veins named Hit\u0101 stretch from the heart to the pericardium; slender as a hair divided into a thousand parts, they are filled with minute atoms of brown,\u2075 white, black, yellow, and red.\u2076 In them (the sleeper) dwells when he has no dreams. (19.)\n\n'Then breath in him becomes one.' Speech with all names enters it. Sight with all forms enters it. Hearing with all sounds enters it. Mind with all thoughts enters it. When he awakes, just as from a burning fire sparks fly to all the quarters, so from this self the breaths proceed\n\n\u00b9 Samv\u0101dayi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\u1e25 cannot legitimately be made intransitive, as in Cowell's translation, and the sense with this reading must be as given. I prefer the reading of the scholiast's recension; samav\u0101dayi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\u1e25, 'thou hast caused me fruitless talk'; so Max M\u00fcller and Deussen. The error in the MSS. is easy in view of the preceding clauses.\n\n\u00b2 Read b\u1e5bhan with \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda and B\u1e5bhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka, ii, 1, 15. Cf. p. 37, n. 2.\n\n\u00b3 The scholiast's recension has 'silent.'\n\n\u2074 That recension ends its section 18 here, and combines the rest of 19 (18) with 20. The \u0100nand. ed. differs, however, and follows in the main the divisions of the ordinary text.\n\n\u2075 'Various colours,' Cowell and Max M\u00fcller, needlessly.\n\n\u2076 Iti here enumerates; above, p. 8, n. 6; below, p. 51, n. 6.\n\n\u2077 Or, 'Then is he absorbed in that Pr\u0101\u1e47a' (Cowell, Deussen, Max M\u00fcller).\nforth according to their stations. From the breaths arise the deities, from the deities the worlds. This breath, the intelligent self, enters into the compound self up to the hair, up to the nails. Just as a razor is placed in a razor-case, or fire in a receptacle of fire, so this intelligent self enters into the corporeal self up to the hair, up to the nails. That self these selves depend on, as his dependants on a rich man. Just as a rich man feeds on his dependants, or his dependants feed on a rich man, so the intelligent self feeds on these selves, or so these selves feed on him. So long as Indra did not know this self, so long had the Asuras the mastery over him. When he knew this self, having slain and conquered the Asuras, he obtained superiority, sovereign control, and lordship over all gods and all beings. Even so one who knows this, smiting away all evils, obtains superiority, sovereign control, and lordship over all beings, one who knows this.'\n\n(20.)\n\nAdhy\u0101ya VII.\n\nOm. I shall proclaim the right, I shall proclaim the true. May that avail me; may that avail the speaker; may it avail me; may it avail the speaker. In me be radiance; in me greatness. Speech rests on my mind; my mind on speech. Be thou revealed to me, that art hidden in Veda\n\n1 Cf. Brhad\u0101ranyaka Upani\u1e63ad, i, 4, 7. 'Wood,' Cowell, Deussen; 'fireplace,' Max M\u00fcller. K\u1e63ura may mean blade only, Hopkins, J.A.O.S., xvii, 61, 79.\n2 Possibly a sheth is already meant. Cf. Hopkins, India, Old and New, pp. 169 seq.\n3 \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda, ignorant of the Vedic idiom (Delbr\u00fcck, Synt. Forsch., v, 132), renders 'eats with,' followed by Cowell, Deussen, and Max M\u00fcller.\n4 This clause is omitted in the scholiast's recension, and also in the Berlin MS., where, however, the previous ca shows the slip, and indicates the process by which that recension arose.\n5 Vidy\u0101ranya, Sarvopani\u1e63adarth\u0101nubh\u016btiprak\u0101\u015ba, ix, 67, points out the pun on Aj\u0101ta\u015batru's name.\n6 See Aitareya Aranyak\u0101, i, 1, 1, note; ii, 7, note; Baudh\u0101yana \u015arauta S\u016btra, ix, 19.\n7 The parallel versions show much divergence, but ts\u0101ri\u1e47\u012br may be an irregular nom. (cf. v.l. in xi, 8), and it makes a good contrast to \u0101vir. The words are given in the \u015a\u0101nti prefixed and appended to the Upani\u1e63ad in the \u0100nand. ed. as \u0101vir m\u0101ryo bh\u016br vedas\u0101 mats\u0101nir, with a commentary of which it is sufficient to say that \u0101\u00f1ir is treated as a verbal form. The corruption (cf. v.l. in my ed.) is apparently too deep-seated for\nand S\u0101man. Right, hurt me not. I spend day and night in learning this. Agni, honour and oblation, honour and oblation; honour be there to the \u1e5a\u1e63is who made the Mantras, who are lords of the Mantras, to the gods. May Sarasvat\u012b be propitious, bearing favour, and kindly to us. May we not be severed from thy sight. Mind undeceived, living eye, sun best of lights. Consecration, harm me not. (1.)\n\nThen follows the Samhit\u0101 Upani\u1e63ad. \u2018Earth is the symbol of the former, the sky of the latter. Wind is the union,\u2019 says \u015aaurav\u012bra M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkeya. \u2018Ether is the union,\u2019 M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davya taught in this connection,\u00b9 \u2018for it is not considered independent, and so I have not agreed with his son.\u2019 \u0100gastya says, \u2018It is independent.\u2019 So wind and ether are the same.\u00b2 So far as regards the deities. Now as regards the self. \u2018Speech is the symbol of the former, mind the form of the latter. Breath is the union,\u2019 says \u015aaurav\u012bra M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkeya. Then his son, D\u012brgha (the tall one), says, \u2018By mind he first proclaims, then speaks with speech. Therefore is mind the symbol of the former, speech of the latter. The union is mind, speech, and breath.\u2019 This chariot, drawn by horses, with a triple yoke, compact of mind, speech, and breath, bears (man) to the world of heaven. He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days. So the M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkeyas. (2.)\u00b3\n\nThen follows (the doctrine) of \u015a\u0101kalya. The earth is the symbol of the former, the heaven of the latter. The wind is the union; the rain is the junction, Parjanya the joiner. When a great cloud rains mightily and unceasing, (they say),\n\n\u00b9 Asya, vague as in Aitareya, iii, 1, 1. Cf. Uvata on Rgveda Pr\u0101ti\u015b\u0101khya, Max M\u00fcller's ed., p. vi, and again in viii, 1. To render it \u2018him\u2019 is possible, but rather strained, with a causative.\n\n\u00b2 Pit\u016bs ca putrasya ca has no sense here, and is a misplacement of a remark which in the fuller version of the Aitareya, iii, 1, 1, where see my note, has a place, but not here.\n\n\u00b3 Followed in the MSS. by an Anukrama\u1e47i of contents, not translated, as it consists merely of the first words in each case. Cf. vi, 2, which is, however, a real summary.\n\u2018Heaven and earth have joined together.\u2019 So far as regards the deities. Now as regards the self. This person is all egg-shaped. There are two halves. In it this is the symbol of the former, this of the latter. Between them here is this ether, just as there is that ether between heaven and earth. In this ether breath is stretched, just as in that ether wind is stretched. As those are those three lights, so there are these three lights. As there is that sun in the heaven, so there is this eye in the head. As there is that lightning in the atmosphere, so there is this heart in the body. As there is this fire on earth, so there is this seed in the organ. Thus, as it were, having compared the body (with the macrocosm) in all points, he says, \u2018This is the symbol of the former, this of the latter.\u2019 The union is mind, speech, and breath. This chariot drawn by horses, with a triple yoke, compact of mind, speech, and breath, bears (man) to the world of heaven. He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days. (3.)\u00b9\n\n\u2018The earth is the symbol of the former, the heaven of the latter. Wind is the union, the quarters the junction, the sun the joiner,\u2019 says Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra. So far as regards the gods. Now as regards the self. Speech is the symbol of the former, mind of the latter. Breath is the union, the ear the junction, the eye the joiner. He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days. (4.)\n\n\u2018Fire is the symbol of the former, the moon of the latter. Lighting is the union,\u2019 says S\u016bryadatta. So far as regards the deities. Now as regards the self. Speech is the symbol of the former, mind of the latter. Truth is the union. He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days. (5.)\n\n\u2018The earth is the symbol of the former,\u00b2 the heaven of the\n\n\u00b9 Cf.

He lives all his days. (6.)\n\n'Speech is the symbol of the former, mind of the latter. Knowledge is the union,' says Pau\u1e63karas\u0101di. He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days. (7.)\n\nThen follow the imprecations.\\(^1\\) One should know that breath is the beam. If one who calls this breath the beam should revile another, if he think himself strong, he says,\\(^2\\) 'Thou hast grasped breath, the beam. Thou canst not be fain to grasp breath, the beam.' Then he should say to him, 'Breath, the beam, will forsake thee.' Again, if he think himself weak, he should say, 'Thou hast been fain to grasp breath, the beam. That thou hast not been able to grasp. Breath, the beam, will forsake thee.' But whatever, whether speaking or not,\\(^3\\) he says to him, it is certain that it shall be accomplished. He should not, however, say anything save what is favourable to a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Only in exceeding prosperity may he speak thus to a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a. 'Not even\\(^4\\) in exceeding prosperity. Let there be honour to Br\u0101hma\u1e47as,' says \u015aaurav\u012bra M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkeya. (8.)\n\nIf another\\(^5\\) revile him who calls breath the beam, if he think him strong, he says, 'I have been fain to grasp\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Neither in Aitareya \u0100ranyaka, iii, 1, 4, nor here, is the sequence of thought or construction perfectly satisfactory, nor can it be made so without violent emendation or interpretation. The easiest change is to read samadh\u0101\u1e41 for samadh\u0101\u1e25, 'I have grasped,' which gives a closer parallel to vii, 9.\n\n\\(^2\\) This \u0101ka (so emended for the \u0101rtha of the MSS.) is strange, but is already in the Aitareya.\n\n\\(^3\\) Apparently, whether cursing or not, his words, if he knows breath as the beam, come true.\n\n\\(^4\\) For the error of the MSS., na ca for ca na, cf. Mbh., xii, 21, 7, corrected by Hopkins, J.A.O.S., xxiii, 119. The locative has probably a causal sense (nimittasaptami), 'because of excessive prosperity.' Cf. vi, 1; vii, 19, and note on Aitareya \u0100ranyaka, iii, 1, 6.\n\n\\(^5\\) Par\u0101\u1e25 must be read to make sense. Cf.

Only in exceeding prosperity may he speak thus to a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a. 'Not even in exceeding prosperity. Let there be honour to Br\u0101hma\u1e47as,' says \u015aaurav\u012bra M\u0101nd\u016bkeya. (9.)\n\nThen follow the declarers of the Nirbhuja.\\(^2\\) The Nirbhuja rests on earth, the Prat\u1e5b\u1e47\u1e47a on heaven, the Udbhayamantare\u1e47a on the atmosphere. If a man who recites the Nirbhuja revile another, he should say to him, 'Thou hast offended earth, the deity; earth, the deity, will punish thee.' If a man who recites the Prat\u1e5b\u1e47\u1e47a revile another, he should say to him, 'Thou hast offended heaven, the deity; heaven, the deity, will punish thee.' If a man who recites the Udbhayamantare\u1e47a revile another, he should say thus to him, 'Thou hast offended the atmosphere, the deity; the atmosphere, the deity, will punish thee.' For when he manifests the Sandhi, that is the form of the Nirbhuja; when he utters the two syllables in their natural form, that is the form of the Prat\u1e5b\u1e47\u1e47a and the original;\\(^3\\) in the Udbhayamantare\u1e47a both are included. He who desires proper food should recite the Nirbhuja; who desires heaven, the Prat\u1e5b\u1e47\u1e47a; who desires both, the Udbhayamantare\u1e47a. Again, if he who recites the Nirbhuja revile another,\\(^4\\) he\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) i.e. whether he reviles or not.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf. Aitareya \u0100ranyaka, iii, 1, 3, from which, as in the case of 8 and 9 above, there are considerable differences.\n\n\\(^3\\) So \u015a\u0101yana on Aitareya, l.c., renders agra u, and it may be correct. The Rgveda Pr\u0101ti\u015b\u0101khya, p. vi (ed. Max M\u00fcller), has:\n\n\\(^4\\) In the Aitareya these curses are only for reply, and the last sentence as to their being no possibility of blaming a reciter of the Udbhayamantare\u1e47a is therefore in place; more so than here, where the reciter is active in cursing. In both 9 and 10 the reading bruvantam para for bruvan param renders the sense much simpler.\nshould say to him, 'Thou hast fallen from the two lower stations.' If he who recites the Prat\u1e5b\u1e47\u1e47a revile another, he should say to him, 'Thou hast fallen from the two higher places.' But for him who recites the Ubhayamantarena there is no rebuke possible. But whatever, whether speaking or not, he says to him, it is certain that it shall be accomplished. He should not, however, say anything save what is favourable to a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Only in exceeding prosperity may he speak thus to a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a. 'Not even in exceeding prosperity. Let there be honour to Br\u0101hma\u1e47as,' says \u015aaurav\u012bra M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkeya. (10.)\n\nThen the reciters of the Nirbhuja\u00b9 say, 'The first syllable is the symbol of the former, the latter of the latter. That which is between the letters y and v is the union.' He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days. (11.)\n\n'Then we say, \"we are reciters of the Nirbhuja,\"' says Hrasva M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkeya, 'the first syllable is the symbol of the former, the latter of the latter. The mora between the former and latter forms, that by which one makes distinct\u00b2 the Sandhi, that by which one distinguishes what is a mora and what is not, that by which one distinguishes accent from accent,\u00b3 that is the union.' He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days. (12.)\n\nThen says his son Madhyama, the son of Pr\u0101tibodh\u012b, who lived in Magadha,\u2074 'The first syllable is the symbol of the former, the latter of the latter. The mora which declares the\n\n\u00b9 For 11\u201313, cf. Aitareya \u0100ranyaka, iii, 1, 5.\n\u00b2 Here and above vivartayati is ambiguous. 'Produces' seems best; possibly 'separates,' 'distinguishes'; cf. Max M\u00fcller, Rgveda Pr\u0101ti\u015b\u0101khya, p. vi.\n\u00b3 'Accent and unaccented' in the Aitareya.\n\u2074 The reference to Magadha denotes its somewhat unbrahminical character, and suggests that in the difficult passage, Aitareya \u0100ranyaka, ii, 1, 1, there should be read V\u0101\u1e45g\u0101-Magadha\u015b Cera-p\u0101d\u0101\u1e25 as names of the outcaste peoples, for the v\u0101\u1e45g\u0101vagadhas of the MSS. For the question of these tribes, cf. Pargiter, J.R.A.S., 1908, pp. 851\u20133. For the confusion of v and m, cf. Bloomfield, J.A.O.S., xiii, p. xcvi, and Wackernagel, Altind. Gramm., i, 223, and cf. Atharva Veda, v, 22, 14.\nSandhi is the gliding. I recognise the gliding as the union.' That is declared in a \u1e5ac:\u2014\n\n'Give us not up to those who, foes in ambuscade, are greedy for the wealth of him who sits at ease,\nWho cherish in their heart abandonment of gods. Brhaspati, the S\u0101man is the highest known.'\n\nHe who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days. (13.)\n\n'Speech is' united with breath,' says Kauntharavya, 'breath with the blowing (air), the blowing (air) with the all-gods, the all-gods with the world of heaven, the world of heaven with Brahman. This is the progressive union.' He who knows thus this union, even so is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven, like this progressive union. If, at the instigation of another or for his own sake, he recites, then in reciting he should know 'The union has gone to heaven; of him who knows the gods, so will it be for his reciting.' This, indeed, is it by this progress. (14.)\n\n'The mother is the form of the former, the father of the latter. The child is the union,' says Bh\u0101rgava. All that is declared to be one. For the mother and the father and the child are this all. This is the Aditi union. For Aditi is this all, whatever this universe is. This is declared in a \u1e5ac:\u2014\n\n'Aditi is the heaven, Aditi atmosphere, Aditi is the mother, the father, and the son,\nAditi is all gods, Aditi the five races, Aditi all that hath been born and shall be born.'\n\n1 RV., ii, 23, 16; Geldner, Ved. Stud., iii, 68.\n2 The latter part of the verse is artificially interpreted.\n3 For 14\u201316, cf. Aitareya Aranyaka, iii, i, 6. For Kauntharavya and Bh\u0101rgava, see J.R.A.S., 1908, p. 371; a Bh\u0101rgava occurs as Vaidarbhi in Pra\u015bna Upanisad, i, 1.\n4 This is the most probable construction of this obscure text, though viduso dev\u0101n might be acc., 'to the knowing gods.'\n5 RV., i, 89, 10 (adapted from Griffiths' trans.).\nHe who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days. (15.)\n\n'The wife is the symbol of the former, the husband of the latter. The son is the union, the seed the joining, the begetting the joiner,' says Sthavira S\u0101kalya. This is the Praj\u0101pati union. He who knows thus this union is increased with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days. (16.)\n\n'Offspring is the symbol of the former, faith of the latter. Action is the union, truth the joiner,' says K\u0101\u015byapa. This is the truth union. They say the gods are of true unions. He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days. (17.)\n\n'Speech is the union,' says Pa\u00f1c\u0101lacanda. By speech, indeed, the Vedas are united, by speech the metres, by speech he unites friends. When he studies or speaks, then breath is in speech, then speech absorbs breath. Again, when he sleeps or is silent, then speech is in breath, then breath absorbs speech; they absorb each other. This is declared in a Rc:\u2014\n\n'One of these birds hath passed into the sea of air; thence he looks round and views this universal world.\n\nWith simple heart I have beheld him close at hand; his mother him absorbs, and her he too absorbs.'\n\nSpeech, indeed, is the mother, breath the child. He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days. (18.)\n\n---\n\n1 Samdh\u0101nam after samdhi\u1e25 must be the agent, which persists in the result.\n2 Praj\u0101yate here for the play on Praj\u0101pati.\n3 On \u015braddh\u0101, cf. Ludwig, Rgveda, iii, 262\u20135; Oldenberg's article, Z.D.M.G., i, 448; A.J.P., xvii, 408. It is more intellectual than the later Bhakti, but it is its lineal predecessor.\n4 Cf. Atharva Veda, xi, 6, 19, 20; Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, i, 6, 7.\n5 RV., x, 114, 4.\n6 For 18, 19, cf. Aitareya \u0100ranyaka, iii, 1, 6; for the S\u0101mans, Hillebrandt, Rom. Forsch., v, 316\u201320; Eggeling, S.B.E., xli, pp. xiv seq.\n'The union is made by the symbol of B\u1e5bhat and Rathantara,' says T\u0101rksya. Speech, indeed, is the symbol of the Rathantara, breath of the B\u1e5bhat. By both, indeed, is the union made, by speech and breath. For the sake of this Upani\u1e63ad one watches cows for a year,' says\u00b9 T\u0101rksya. 'For the sake of just this one watches cows for a year,' says T\u0101rksya. He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days. (19.)\n\n'Movement is the symbol of the former, stopping of the latter. Rest is the union,' says J\u0101ratk\u0101rava \u0100rtabha\u1e45ga.\u00b2 In this union there are united dhvamsis,\u00b3 nime\u1e63as, k\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101s, seconds, minutes, hours, days and nights, half-months, months, seasons, and years. This union unites these times; time unites movement, stopping, and rest. By movement, stopping, and rest, all this is united. So far as regards the deities. Now as regards the self. The past is the symbol of the former, the future of the latter. The present is the union. This is the time union. This is declared in a \u1e5ac:\u2014\n\n'Great is that secret name, and far extending, whereby thou madest all present and future.\n\nThe light he loveth that was made aforetime, the five tribes whom he loveth well have entered.'\n\nHe who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days. (20.)\n\nThen follows the saying of V\u0101li\u015bikh\u0101yani.\u2075 'There are, then,\n\n\u00b9 In the Aitareya he is said to guard the cows, presumably a more primitive view than that which merely makes him the authority.\n\u00b2 Cf. for him, B\u1e5bhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka, iii, 2, 1.\n\u00b3 Dhvamsi is a special term of this school, J.R.A.S., 1908, p. 373. The exact relations are unknown. In the \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana \u015arauta S\u016btra, xiv, 81 and 82, the nime\u1e63a is a tenth of a muh\u016brta (a thirtieth of a day) and a dhvamsi a tenth of a nime\u1e63a. The words 'seconds . . hours' are kal\u0101\u1e25 k\u1e63an\u0101\u1e25 muh\u016brta\u1e25. See Hopkins, J.A.O.S., xxiv, 13.\n\u2074 RV., x, 55, 2.\n\u2075 Cf. for the teaching, Aitareya \u0100ra\u1e47yaka, ii, 6. The name is new and late, and the teaching itself raises the question of the relation of this text to the S\u0101\u1e43khya system, which recognises the tanm\u0101tras and the mixed relations of the Mah\u0101bh\u016btas, see Garbe, S\u0101\u1e43khya Philosophie, pp. 237, 239, and Deussen, Phil. of the Upanishads, pp. 193 seq. We need not, however, assume that this passage is borrowed from the S\u0101\u1e43khya. If Deussen exaggerates the certainty of the derivation from the Ved\u0101nta of that system, Garbe equally exaggerates the character of its revolt (op. cit.,\nfive gross elements,' says V\u0101lisikh\u0101yani, 'the earth, wind, ether, water, light. These are united with each other. Again, the others, the small ones, are united with the gross elements. This is the union of all elements. He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days. (21.)\n\n'The whole of speech is Brahman,' says Lauhikya. Whatever sounds there are, let him know to be speech. This a \u1e5a\u1e63i declares:\u20142\n\n'I with the Rudras and the Vasus fare.'\n\nThis speech is all sounds. He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days. And even as Brahman(n.) can change form at will and move at will, so among all beings can he change form and move at will who knows thus. (22.)\n\nAdhy\u0101ya VIII.\n\nOm. 'Breath is the beam,' says Sthavira \u015a\u0101kalya. 'Just as all the other beams rest on the main-beam, so the whole self rests on this breath. Of this self breath is the symbol of the sibilants, the bones of the mutes, the marrow of the vowels, the flesh and blood, the fourth element, of the semi-vowels.'3 'But\n\npp. 5\u201320), and the tanm\u0101tra conception has no necessary connection with the fundamental view of either system, while the Ved\u0101nta adopts it in the physiology of the self. The mistake of Garbe's view of the Paur\u0101nic S\u0101\u1e43khya (pp. 53 seq.) and of the Bhagavadg\u012bt\u0101 (cf. his trans., Leipzig, 1905, and Hopkins' review, J.R.A.S., 1905, pp. 384\u20139) seems to me to lie in not recognising the great part played in all Vedic and Hindu religion by Bhakti, which is accompanied by a quasi-theistic, quasi-pantheistic, conception of philosophy, such as is made explicit in the \u015ar\u012bbh\u0101ya of R\u0101ma\u1e47uja, see J.R.A.S., 1906, pp. 490 seq.; Grierson, ibid., 1908, p. 361. The issue is not so much between pantheism and theism, which indeed tend to blend into each other, but between atheism as in the S\u0101\u1e43khya and Buddhism, Advaitism as in \u015aa\u1e45kara, and the Dvaitism of the Bh\u0101gavatas, P\u0101\u015bupatas, etc., who de facto are pantheists, since in a sense all is in God, theists since God is the object of devotion and individual souls seek Him, yet are not merged in or identical with Him, and who believe in the real existence of the world. Cf. Vij\u00f1\u0101nabhi\u1e63u's S\u0101\u1e43khya-pravacanabh\u0101ya (Garbe, op. cit., pp. 75\u20137, 115); Thibaut, S.B.E., xxxiv, pp. xcvii seq.\n\n1 Perhaps Lauhitya, cf. J.R.A.S., 1908, p. 372, n. 1; Jaiminiya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a Upani\u1e63ad, iii, 42, 1 (a Vam\u015ba).\n\n2 RV., x, 125, 1.\n\n3 The parallel version, Aitareya \u0100ra\u1e47yaka, iii, 2, 1, has antasth\u0101r\u016bpam, and this gives the sense.\nwe have heard of a triad only,' says Hrasva M\u0101nd\u016bkeya. Of this triad, on one side there are three hundred and sixty joinings, on the other the same; these make up seven hundred and twenty. Seven hundred and twenty, indeed, are the days and nights of the year. Thus he obtains the days and nights of the year. This is the self, commensurate with the year, composed of the eye, the ear, the metres, the mind, speech. He who knows thus this self, commensurate with the year, composed of the eye, the ear, the metres, the mind, speech, wins union, and communion with the year, residence in the same world, and similarity of form. He becomes rich in sons and cattle. He lives all his days. So taught \u0100runikeya.\u00b9 (1.)\n\nThen follows (the teaching of) Kaun\u1e6dharavya.\u00b2 There are three hundred and sixty letters, three hundred and sixty sibilants, three hundred and sixty unions. What we have called letters,\u00b3 they are the days. What we have called sibilants, they are the nights. What we have called unions, they are the unions of days and nights. So far as regards the deities. Now as regards the self. What we have called letters as regards the deities, these are bones as regards the self. What we have called sibilants as regards the deities, these are marrow as regards the self. This indeed is the chief breath, marrow. This is seed. Without breath, indeed, seed cannot be won. If without breath seed were effused,\u2074 it would decay, it would not be productive. What we have called unions as regards the deities, these are joints\u2075 as regards the self. Of this triad,\u2076 bones, marrow, joints, on this side there are five hundred and forty unions, on that side the same; this makes a thousand and eighty. One thousand and eighty Br\u0101hma\u1e47i verses the singers\u2077 produce on this day as the (hymn\n\n\u00b9 Cf. J.R.A.S., 1908, p. 371. For asya, cf. vii, 2, note.\n\u00b2 Cf.

He who knows thus this self, commensurate with the day, composed of the eye, the ear, the metres, the mind, speech, wins union and communion with the days, residence in the same world, and similarity of form. He becomes rich in cows and cattle. He lives all his days. (2.)\n\n'There are four persons,' says V\u0101tsya,\\(^1\\) 'the person of the body, the person of the metres, the person of the Vedas, the great person.' What we have called the person of the body is the corporeal self. Of it the essence is this incorporeal intelligent self. What we have called the person of the metres is the alphabet. Of it the letter \\(a\\) is the essence.\\(^2\\) What we have called the person of the Vedas is that by which one knows the Vedas, the \u1e5agveda, the Yajurveda, the S\u0101maveda. Of it the Brahman(n.) is the essence. Therefore one should take as priest a Brahman priest fullest of Brahman, who can know the unusual\\(^3\\) in the sacrifice. What we have called the great person is the year. Of it yonder sun is the essence. The incorporeal intelligent self here and yonder sun are the same, so one should know. This is declared in a Rc.\u2014\\(^4\\) (3.)\n\n'The brilliant presence of the gods has risen, the eye of Mitra, Varu\u1e47a, and Agni.\n\nThe soul of all that moveth not or moveth, the sun hath filled the air and earth and heaven.'\n\n'Thus do I deem the union duly made,' says V\u0101tsya. Him the Bahv\u1e5bcas seek in the Mahad Uktha, him the Adhvaryus in the fire, him the Chandogas in the Mah\u0101vrata, him on earth, him in the atmosphere, him in the heaven, him in the fire, him in the wind, him in the moon, him in the Nak\u1e63atras,\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf.

In Mbh., vi, 112, 12, we have the moon, av\u0101k\u015b\u012bras, as a portent, but it is, I think, significant of the early date of the Upani\u1e63ad that the Grahas do not appear here; in the epic they are prominent, Hopkins, J.A.O.S., xxiv, 38 seq. See also Weber, Omina und Portenta ; Konow, S\u0101mavidh\u0101na Br\u0101hma\u1e47a ; Aus\u0101sanas\u0101dbhut\u0101ni, J.A.O.S., xv, 207\u201320 ; Z.D.M.G., xxxii, 573 seq.\nknow. Whatever he considers should be done, he should do. Again, if he sees himself in a mirror or water with a crooked head or without a head, or cannot see himself, he should know that it is so. Again, if his shadow is pierced, or he throws no shadow, he should know that it is so. Again, if the sun appears pierced like the nave of a chariot wheel, he should know that it is so. Again, if the fire appears black like the neck of a peacock, or if amid a large cloud he should see as it were brightness, or when there is no cloud see lightning, or in cloudy weather see it not, he should know that it is so. Again, if closing his eyes he does not see motes, as it were, he should know that it is so. Again, if he shut his ears and listen, and does not then hear a noise as of burning fire or the sound of a chariot, he should know that it is so. Again, if the pupils of the eyes appear inverted or doubly crooked, or cannot be seen, he should know that it is so. 'The unheard, unthought, unknown, unseen, undirected, soundless hearer, thinker, knower, seer, director, sounder, the inner self of all beings, he is my soul,' so should one know. He departing enters into this incorporeal intelligent self, and abandons the other corporeal self. This is the Upani\u1e63ad of speech as a whole. All these, indeed, are Upani\u1e63ads of speech as a whole, but this one they call so especially.

The mutes are the form of the \u1e5agveda, the sibilants of the Yajurveda, the vowels of the S\u0101maveda. The mutes are the form of the Rathantara, the sibilants of the V\u0101madevya, the vowels of the Br\u0101hat. The mutes are the form of expiration, the sibilants of inspiration, the vowels of Vy\u0101na.\\(^2\\) The mutes are the form of expiration, the sibilants of inspiration, the vowels of mind.

As this has a sounding-board\\(^1\\) and is tightly strung, so has that a sounding-board and is tightly strung. As this has a head, so that has a head. As this has a spine,\\(^2\\) so that has a bridge. As this has a belly, so that has a cavity. As this has mouth, nose, and eyes, so that has holes. As this has joints,\\(^3\\) so that has finger-catches and covers. As this has fingers, so that has strings. As this has a tongue, so that has a sounder. As this has sounds, so that has sounds. As this is covered with a hairy skin, so that is covered with a hairy skin. For with a hairy skin they used of old to cover lutes. This is the divine lute. He who knows thus this divine lute becomes exceedingly famous; his renown fills the earth; men hearken to him when he speaks in the assemblies, (saying), \u2018Let this be done which he desires.\u2019 Where \u0100ryan speech is uttered they know him there. (9.)\n\nThen follows the saying of T\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davindava. As a lute struck by an unskilled player fulfils not the full purpose of a lute, so speech set in motion by an unskilled speaker fulfils not the full purpose of speech. As a lute struck by a skilled player fulfils the full purpose of a lute, so speech set in motion by a skilled speaker fulfils the full purpose of speech. \u2018Of this lute the splendour is the union,\u2019 says the son of K\u0101ty\u0101yani, J\u0101tukar\u1e47ya.\n\nNow K\u1e5btsna H\u0101rita sets forth a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a.\\(^4\\) (10.)\n\nPraj\u0101pati having created creatures fell to pieces.

The eye indeed is support. He who knows obtainment, his desires are obtained together for him. The ear indeed is obtainment. He who knows the resort becomes the resort of his own (people).

These deities approached Praj\u0101pati and said, \u2018Who indeed is the best of us?\u2019 Praj\u0101pati said, \u2018He is the best on whose departure the body considers itself worst as it were.\u2019 (2.)\n\nSpeech departed.

In him he made these deities to dwell, in his speech fire, in his expiration wind, in his inspiration the lightning, in his Ud\u0101na Parjanya, in his eye the sun, in his mind the moon, in his ear the quarters, in his body the earth, in his seed the waters, in his strength Indra, in his anger \u012a\u015b\u0101na, in his head the ether, in his self Brahman(n.). As a great jar of ambrosia stands swelling, so he stood. Then these deities considered, \u2018What shall this person do with us, or what we with him? Come, let us depart from the body.\u2019 They departed. Then this body was, as it were empty, and perforated on all sides.\u00b3 Praj\u0101pati reflected,\n\n\u00b9 i.e. the real and the \u0101ntara Agnihotras, but the real one, even if performed without knowledge, is ineffective.

B; for the confusion of ud and ad, cf. v. 5.\n\u00b3 This seems the most probable sense (pari-su\u1e63ira) and supports the emendation to randhr\u0101ya na k\u1e63amam (for na m\u0101k\u1e63am of the MSS.) which I have made in the next sentence. Otherwise we might read pari\u1e63usiram, and take it as \u2018dried up,\u2019 from \u015bvas with \u012bra, cf. Lindner, Altind.

He may see either light, as it were, in a great cloud or lightning without a cloud, or not see lightning in a cloud. Closing his eyes he does not see motes, as it were. Or closing his ears he does not hear a noise, as it were. He has no joy in this world; his mind pleases him not.\\(^2\\) These are the waking visions. (3.)\n\nThen follow the dream visions. He sees a black man with black teeth. He kills him, a boar kills him, a monkey kills him. He devours stalks; having devoured them he spits them forth. He carries a single lotus. Wearing a wreath of spikenard, he drives towards the south a cow with its calf. If he sees any of the following things, a yellow-looking or black woman, with loosened hair, or shaved, anointing with sesamum oil, a garment dyed with safflower, singing, a buffalo carriage, going to the south, etc., having looked at them he fasts, cooks milk in a pot, using the milk of a cow which\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. viii, 7.\n\n\\(^2\\) Or 'it pleases not him, his mind,' an acc. of whole and part, rare in Vedic and Sanskrit, Speyer, *Vedische und Sanskrit Syntax*, p. 8, whose citation of Atharva Veda, v, 8, 9, is not in point, as marm\u0101\u1e47i is a false reading for marmani.\nhas a calf like itself, but on no account of a black cow, piles up the fire, sweeps out (the place of sacrifice), scatters grass, sprinkles water around, and, bending the right knee, offers oblations of ghee by means of a ladle.

J.R.A.S., 1907, pp. 938 seq.; Westermarck, Anthropological Essays, p. 374; Origin and Development of Moral Ideas, i, 445 seq.; Farnell, Cults of the Greek States, iii, 11.\n4 Cf.

We must therefore accept L\u00fcders\u2019 doctrine (*Das W\u00fcrfelspiel im alten Indien*, p. 21) that the mention of gold dice need not refer to the late p\u0101saka game. Even in the Vibh\u012b\u1e63aka game a rich man might ostentatiously have golden dice, and this notice shows they were actually used, not merely a ritual aberration; *J.R.A.S.*, 1908, p. 827.\n\n\\(^3\\) Cf.

A man who desires prosperity should fast on flowers for three nights, then taking a piece from a living\\(^2\\) elephant's tusk, he should pile up the fire, sweep out (the place of sacrifice), scatter grass, sprinkle water around, and bending his right knee, place the amulet in a vessel to the north of the fire, sacrifice, and pour upon the amulet the remnant from the oblation, to the accompaniment of the eight verses (vv. 1\u20138), beginning 'Splendour of the elephant,' verse by verse. Then for seven nights, or three nights, or one he should leave it to stand in honey and ghee and then put it on, with the verse (v. 7) 'Snatched out of ghee.' Then next with six (vv. 9\u201314) he should put on, having left it to stand for three nights or one in (a mess of) meat and boiled rice, an amulet of the point of the heart-spit or the point of the goad or the point of the mortar or of the core\\(^3\\) of the Acacia catechu. Then next with four verses (vv. 15\u201318) he should put on an amulet of the point of a bull's horn, having left it to stand for three nights or one in (a mess of) ghee and boiled rice. Then next with one verse (v. 19) he should put on an amulet of the castor-oil plant, having left it to stand for three nights or one in (a mess of) sesamum and boiled rice. Then next with sixteen verses (vv. 20\u201335) he should put on an amulet of Bilva, having left it to stand for seven nights or three or one in honey and ghee, fastening it with the verse (v. 34) 'Snatched out of ghee.'

There can, however, be no doubt that this position of the day is rather artificial, and that the Mah\u0101vrata marks the commencement of the year. The priestly ingenuity, which has transferred the Mah\u0101vrata to the second last day of the year, has created a duplicate in the Caturvim\u015ba, the second day of the Gav\u0101mayana, but it is easy to see through so obvious a manipulation.\n\nMuch more obscure is the relation of the Mah\u0101vrata and the Vi\u1e63uvant day, which in the accepted system is reckoned as the middle of the Gav\u0101mayana. Professor Hillebrandt\u00b9 has expressed the view that the Vi\u1e63uvant and the Mah\u0101vrata have been changed in place by the priests, and that originally the Mah\u0101vrata fell on the Summer solstice, and the Vi\u1e63uvant began the year at the Winter solstice. The view is extremely plausible and supported by strong arguments, so that it deserves full and careful consideration.\n\nNow it is quite certain that the accepted ritualistic view places the Mah\u0101vrata at the Winter solstice. The Kau\u015bitaki Br\u0101hma\u1e47a,\u00b2 for example, explicitly says that it occurs at the moment when the sun, after going south for six months, stops, as it is about to turn for the north. It has, indeed, been suggested that the six monthly periods refer to the equinoxes, but I consider that Dr. Thibaut\u00b3 has once and for all disposed of this argument, which in any case would not affect Professor Hillebrandt\u2019s position. It remains, therefore, to seek for\n\n\u00b9 See Hillebrandt, Rom. Forsch., v, 299 seq.; Vedische Opfer und Zauber, pp. 157, 158; Vedische Mythologie, iii, 216. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, p. 444, rejects the theory of change of date, but gives no reasons.\n\u00b2 xix, 3.\n\u00b3 Ind. Ant., xxiv, 85 seq.\nevidence showing that another dating of the Mah\u0101vrata was possible.\n\nA sign of this has been seen by Professor Hillebrandt in the statement in the Pa\u00f1cavim\u015ba Br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u00b9 that the Mah\u0101vrata should be placed in the middle of the year. But the statement is not accepted by the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a as correct, and as it is characteristic of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a style to make every sort of vague suggestion before arriving at the facts, it is not even possible to say that any Brahminical school, much less the people, ever reckoned the Mah\u0101vrata at the Summer solstice.\n\nMore important is a second argument derived from the assignment of S\u0101mans to the Mah\u0101vrata in the \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana \u015arauta S\u016btra.\u00b2 That S\u016btra ascribes to that day the Brhat, Mah\u0101div\u0101k\u012brtya, and Rathantara S\u0101mans, and Professor Hillebrandt shows that the Brhat is made up of hymns and verses addressed for the most part, though not in all cases, to Indra, the Mah\u0101div\u0101k\u012brtya of hymns and verses addressed to S\u016brya. Now both the Maitr\u0101ya\u1e47i Samhit\u0101\u00b3 and the Taittir\u012bya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2074 connect the Vi\u1e63uvant with the Div\u0101k\u012brtya or Mah\u0101div\u0101k\u012brtya S\u0101man, and it is therefore suggested that the presence of this S\u0101man in the Mah\u0101vrata is merely the result of contamination of the rites, and that originally to the Mah\u0101vrata and the Vi\u1e63uvant respectively belonged the Brhat and the Mah\u0101div\u0101k\u012brtya S\u0101mans, connected the one with Indra, the other with S\u016brya. Now prayers to S\u016brya are most naturally connected with the efforts required at the Winter solstice to rescue the sun from destruction and death, while Indra\u2019s season is the breaking of the monsoon about the Summer solstice, when he overcomes V\u1e5btra, the demon of drought, and waxes great.\u2075 A further support for this argument is derived from the third of the S\u0101mans assigned to the Mah\u0101vrata by \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana, the Rathantara. That S\u0101man was, it is held, originally, in place of the Mah\u0101div\u0101k\u012brtya, the S\u0101man of the Vi\u1e63uvant, and as it is evidently connected with the sun\u2014its very name \u2018wheel-impelling\u2019 reminding us of the wheels used in Schleswig at\n\n\u00b9 iv, 10, 3; cf. Taittir\u012bya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, i, 2, 6.\n\u00b2 xi, 13, 21 seq.\n\u00b3 iv, 8, 10.\n\u2074 i, 2, 3, 1.\n\u2075 Aitareya Aranyaka, i, 1, 1, with my note.\nthe Winter solstice as sun-spells\u2014we have another argument for the connection of the Vi\u1e63uvant with the Winter sun and the Mah\u0101vrata with the Summer solstice.\n\nThe argument clearly rests on too many hypotheses to be convincing. In the first place, it should be noted that the \u0100\u015bval\u0101yana \u015arauta S\u016btra\\(^1\\) sets only the Mah\u0101div\u0101k\u012brtya S\u0101man in connection with the Mah\u0101vrata. Professor Hillebrandt meets this objection by regarding the version of the ritual in \u0100\u015bval\u0101yana as later than that in \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana, but Dr. Friedl\u00e4nder\\(^2\\) and I\\(^3\\) have adduced a good deal of evidence to prove that the \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana ritual generally is of a more elaborate and artificial type than that of \u0100\u015bval\u0101yana, and that the relation in time of the two S\u016btras is the reverse of that accepted by Professor Hillebrandt. It is therefore very difficult to eliminate from the Mah\u0101vrata the Mah\u0101div\u0101k\u012brtya S\u0101man, which by both \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana and \u0100\u015bval\u0101yana is assigned to the Mah\u0101vrata. Again, there is no evidence whatever for the connection of the Rathantara and the Vi\u1e63uvant beyond the improbable and unsupported conjecture that it originally occupied the place of the Mah\u0101div\u0101k\u012brtya. Moreover, the Br\u0325hat and Mah\u0101div\u0101k\u012brtya cannot be assigned solely to Indra and S\u016brya respectively, without the arbitrary elimination of portions of the received forms of these S\u0101mans as used in this ritual.\\(^4\\)\n\nSecondly, even if we accepted as true all these hypotheses, and assumed that the Mah\u0101vrata was connected with Indra alone and the Vi\u1e63uvant with S\u016brya alone, nevertheless we would not be bound to accept the theory that the former must be placed at the Summer solstice. There is no obvious reason why S\u016brya should not be celebrated at the Summer solstice as at the Winter solstice, and the wheel rite of Schleswig at the Winter solstice quoted by Professor Hillebrandt may be balanced\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) viii, 6. The Kau\u1e63itaki Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, xxv, 4, on the other hand, mentions that both the Br\u0325hat and Mah\u0101div\u0101k\u012brtya S\u0101mans were by some assigned to the Vi\u1e63uvant. The \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana and \u0100itareya \u0100ranyakas recognise both Br\u0325hat and Rathantara for the Mah\u0101vrata.\n\n\\(^2\\) In his edition of the \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana \u0100ranyaka, Mah\u0101vrata section, pp. 9 seq.\n\n\\(^3\\) \u0100itareya \u0100ranyaka, pp. 30 seq.\n\n\\(^4\\) Cf. also \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana \u015arauta S\u016btra, xi, 14, 8; Eggeling, S.B.E., xli, p. xv, n.\nby the similar use of a wheel at the Summer solstice at the present day both in France and Germany, a custom which, according to a medi\u00e6val writer cited by Frazer, was one of the three great features of the Midsummer ritual. In the case of Indra we can now quote Professor Hillebrandt against himself, for he has in his *Vedische Mythologie* abandoned the idea that Indra's foe, V\u1e5btra, is a drought demon, and now finds in him the Winter, without, however, giving up his theory of the Mah\u0101vrata. It is not necessary here to discuss in detail how far the view, which converts Indra into a sun-god, is an accurate representation of the facts of the Rgveda as they stand. It is sufficient for our purpose to accept the view of Weber that the conflict of the sun and Winter is Indo-European, or at least Indo-Iranian, and that this conflict is inseparably confused and combined with the later and more specially Indian conception\u2014naturally adopted under the climatic conditions of Hindustan\u2014of a conflict between the drought and the thunderer.\n\nThe further arguments adduced by Professor Hillebrandt may be dismissed more briefly. The third ground brought forward by him is the fact that the Vi\u1e63uvant forms the middle of a period of twenty-one days, and this period may be compared with a period of like duration, apparently dating from the end of November or the beginning of December, of which faint traces are found in German mythology. But no stress can be laid on this argument, for no special significance attaches to the period of twenty-one days in the Vedic ritual\u2014it is merely one of various similar groupings\u2014while the Germanic evidence is not merely very scanty and doubtful, but, if it shows anything, shows that the period lay just before the Winter solstice, whereas the Vi\u1e63uvant is preceded by and followed by ten days on either side.\n\nThe next argument rests on the fact that according to one theory mentioned in the Kau\u1e63itaki Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, xix, 2, the Mah\u0101vrata would have fallen in the month Tai\u1e63a. This month derives its name from the asterism Ti\u1e63ya, which is equated with the\n\n---\n\n1 Frazer, *Golden Bough*, ii, 260 seq.\n2 iii, 162 seq.\n3 See Bloomfield, *Vedic Religion*, pp. 179 seq.; *J.R.A.S.*, 1908, p. 883.\nAvestan Tistrya and that again with Sirius. Sirius represents the heat of Summer, and hence it is deduced that the Mah\u0101vrata must fall in the Summer. But even if we accept the equation of Tistrya and Sirius,\\(^1\\) which is by no means without phonetic difficulties, there remains the fact that there is no evidence that Ti\u1e63ya was ever to the Vedic Indians a Summer month. The asterism Ti\u1e63ya in the Taittiriya Sa\u1e43hit\u0101\\(^2\\) holds the same position to the others as Pu\u1e63ya in the Atharvan\\(^3\\) list, and the commentators on the passages where Tai\u1e63a as a name of a month is found concur in equating it with Pau\u1e63a, while Professor Hillebrandt himself admits that this was probably already the view of the Kau\u1e63\u012btaki Br\u0101hma\u1e47a.\n\nIt is not necessary to discuss the minor arguments adduced by Professor Hillebrandt,\\(^4\\) as he naturally lays no stress on the allegorical plays on the S\u0101mans and on their connection with the length of the day, etc., which he adduces and explains on his theory just as little convincingly as on any other. It remains, however, to be seen whether the actual rites throw any light on the season at which they were held.\n\nThe chief characteristic of the rite is the bird shape\\(^5\\) ascribed to the litany, the Mahad Uktha, as also to the altar and to the sacred fire. Now the bird is undoubtedly the sun-bird, for it is addressed in the ritual\\(^6\\) by the word garutman, \u2018winged,\u2019 which in the \u1e5agveda itself denotes the sun-bird.\\(^7\\) Both the sun (\u0100ditya) and the fire (Agni) receive formal worship, and there can be no doubt of the sun-character of the swing which is set up and pushed from east to west by the priests. Already in the \u1e5agveda\\(^8\\) the sun is described as the golden swing in\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. Weber, Altiran. Sternnamen, p. 15; Zimmer, Altind. Leben, p. 355.

Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 39.\n\n\\(^8\\) vii, 87, 5.\nheaven, and the direction of the motion is extremely significant. Moreover, in one of the formul\u00e6 accompanying the bringing of the swing into contact with the ground, occur the words, 'the great hath united with the great,' this being explained as Agni\u2014here clearly in his celestial form\u2014with the earth.\\(^1\\) Still more significant is a struggle between an \u0100rya, normally a Vai\u015bya, and a \u015a\u016bdra for a round white skin, which is won by the \u0100rya and used by him to strike down his defeated rival. The old tradition, already known to the K\u0101thaka, equates the skin and the sun,\\(^2\\) and, like all the other details mentioned, this equation suits admirably the conception of the rite as an attempt to stimulate the sun at the Winter solstice both by worship and by magic. The movement of the swing stimulates its motion; the \u0100rya rescues it from the hostile powers which threaten to extinguish its light. Neither act is quite so appropriate at the Summer solstice, when the sun's heat is strong and needs no recruiting.\n\nIn this connection can also be explained the use of a drum by the priest and of various musical instruments\u2014a long list of names of these instruments is given made up of rare popular words\u2014by women, whose presence and activity are characteristic of the popular character of the ritual. These noises may have been designed, like the gong at Dodona, to drive away evil demons,\\(^3\\) and to protect at once the sun and the performers of the rite from their onslaught, and the sounds of the musical instruments were reinforced by the shout of the priests. Professor Hillebrandt prefers to regard the use of the drum as an imitation of the thunder, designed to evoke real thunder, but the simpler explanation is here quite adequate.\n\nNor can any support of Professor Hillebrandt's theory be\n\n\\(^1\\) \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana \u0100ranyaka, i, 5.\n\n\\(^2\\) See Oldenberg, *Religion des Veda*, p. 88, n. 4, and K\u0101thaka Samhita, xxiv, 5, cited by Weber, *Ind.

This passage shows clearly that the analysis of \u015b\u016bdr\u0101ryau as \u015b\u016bdra and arya is incorrect and strengthens Geldner's view that arya never means the \u0100ryan (*Ved.

The performance was accompanied by a running commentary of praise and criticism by two persons selected for that purpose. This is probably a priestly refinement, for this feature of the rite is one of the least well authenticated.\\(^1\\) On the other hand, all the versions agree in mentioning the *brahm\u0101c\u0101ri\u1e47\u012b\u015bc\u0101lyoh samprav\u0101da*, a contest in ritual *ai\u1e63\u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1* between a hetaera and a Brahmin scholar vowed to chastity. Various theories have been advanced to explain such instances of *ai\u1e63\u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1*; the simplest perhaps is that it is merely another method of demon-scaring, but the evidence for this view is hardly convincing, and it seems best to regard the ritual here, as in the Thesmophoria,\\(^3\\) as undoubtedly calculated to promote the fertility of beings and the earth. This view is probably rendered certain by a further custom merely referred to in the Aitareya \u0100ranyak\u0101\\(^4\\) in the terse words *bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 ca maithunam*, and by a singular example of priestly or general moral progress repudiated as *pur\u0101\u1e47am utsannam* in the \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana \u015arauta S\u016btra,\\(^5\\) but referred to in the Taittir\u012bya Samhit\u0101 and described fully in the other S\u016btra accounts.\\(^6\\) This rite must be compared with the *\u03b9\u03b5\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b3\u03ac\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2*\\(^7\\) of the Greek and Asianic ritual and brought into connection with the symbolic union of earth and sun, the touching of the earth by the swing. Probably originally the rite was one celebrated by two \u0100ryans, the *pum\u015bcali*, like the M\u0101gadha of L\u0101ty\u0101yana, representing a degradation of the rite, and was a solemn ceremony, at once a counterpart of the union of sun and earth, whence sprang fertility for the crops, and a powerful spell to promote human fertility. All this is perfectly\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) It is noticed in neither of the Rgvedic \u0100ranyakas, but it occurs in Taittir\u012bya Samhit\u0101, vii, 5, 9, 3.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf. Campbell, *Ind.

The sense of *utsanna* is here made clear by the continuation *na k\u0101ryam*.\n\n\\(^6\\) The plural in the Aitareya suggests that the ritual involved the union of more pairs than one, representing the different sides of animal life. The Taittir\u012bya, vii, 5, 9, 4, has only one pair.\n\n\\(^7\\) I assume that the *\u03b9\u03b5\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b3\u03ac\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2* is a remnant of a real marriage, not a mere symbolism, but intended to promote fertility as a magic spell. Cf. Farnell, op. cit., i, 184 seq.\ncompatible with a Midwinter rite, when heat is needed for the earth and there is every reason to stimulate fertility.\n\nIt is, however, true that an explanation can be offered of the facts if they are regarded as taking place at Midsummer. Dr. Frazer\\(^1\\) quotes cases both of May and Midsummer pairs as representatives of the spirit of vegetation in its reproductive capacity, and the drumming might be a thunder-magic, as at Dorpat in Russia.\\(^2\\) A further support for this theory may be found in a feature of the ritual which has not yet been mentioned. Maidens with water pitchers dance round a fire singing, in one version\\(^3\\)\u2014'The cows smell pleasantly: here is sweet drink! The cows smell with sweet odour: sweet drink! The cows are mothers of butter: sweet drink! May they increase amongst us: sweet drink! The cows we would have bathe (in water): sweet drink!' As they dance they strike their right thighs with their right hands, or, according to Hiranyak\u00e9sin, beat the ground with their right feet, and their dance is pradak\u1e63i\u1e47am,\\(^4\\) following the sun's motion. Finally, they cast the contents of their pitchers into the M\u0101rjaliya fire. With such a dance may, of course, be compared the dance of the 'Sweethearts of St. John' and others on St. John's Eve in Sardinia, or the dance of the Oraons and Mundas of Bengal (a non-Aryan people) around the Karma-tree.\\(^5\\) Nor can there be any doubt that the rite is essentially a rain-spell of a common type, and it is possible that the ceremonial beating of the thighs is a remnant of a more serious effort to expel evil influences and promote fertility.\\(^6\\) But granting all this, there is still no cogent reason for transferring the time to Midsummer. The rains which it is sought to invoke may, as Professor Oldenberg\\(^7\\) has pointed out, quite as well be\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Adonis, Attis, Osiris\\(^2\\), pp. 208, 209.\n\n\\(^2\\) Golden Bough, i, 13.\n\n\\(^3\\) Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, p. 445.\n\n\\(^4\\) See Caland & Henry, L'Agnistoma, p. xxxvii.\n\n\\(^5\\) Adonis, Attis, Osiris\\(^2\\), pp. 198 seq.; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie ii, 190.\n\n\\(^6\\) Cf. the rite of the Lupercalia (Warde Fowler, op. cit., p. 311) and the Thesmophoria (Farnell, op. cit., iii, 104); K\u0101thaka, xiii, 10.\n\n\\(^7\\) Religion des Veda, p. 445; cf.

Professor Hillebrandt uses, however, the fact that the water is poured over the fire as a piece of evidence in favour of the Midsummer date. In his view the act symbolises the extinction of the burning heat of Summer by the rain of the monsoon, and is a spell to bring down the rains. But this view seems somewhat far-fetched. For it must be noted that de facto there is no hint in any of our texts that the fire is extinguished by the water, and, indeed, no one familiar with the ritual would expect that a sacred fire should be so summarily disposed of, so that (unless we assume that the original practice has been obliterated by priestly developments) the magic spell would hardly be successful as a spell, if in fact it fails to accomplish even its proximate purpose, the quenching of the terrestrial fire. If a symbolical explanation must be found, it would seem preferable to take the union of water with the fire as denoting the \\(\\kappa\\rho\\alpha\\sigma\\iota\\varsigma\\) of the wet and warm elements to bring forth the harvest. Or, more simply, the rite may be regarded as a water-spell in the dashing of the water over the fire, the fire being chosen as the receptacle simply because it is the natural place in which all offerings are made, and the song of the maidens shows that the water they bear is regarded as more than mere water, as madhu, and a suitable drink for the god \u0100ditya, who is clearly intended to drink it, as is shown conclusively, e.g. in the Aitareya version.\n\nSo far we have found no trace in the ritual of the most characteristic feature of modern vegetation rituals at Midsummer, the animal or human representation of the corn or vegetation spirit, nor does Professor Hillebrandt seek to find any such phenomena in the Mah\u0101vrata. It is, however, only fair to note the evidence which could be alleged in favour of this view. The Mah\u0101vrata is by no means a bloodless sacrifice. There\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Taittir\u012bya Samhit\u0101, vii, 2, 10, 1 seq.; Kau\u1e63itaki Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, xix, 3, where in Caitra the sasya is ready.\nfell to be offered either one beast to be sacrificed to Indra and Agni or a batch of eleven, and in either case there is an additional sacrifice of a bull to Indra or to Praj\u0101pati, and in the former case of a goat to Praj\u0101pati.\\(^1\\) Now at least in some cases the skin of the sacrificial animal was removed and used to form the drum (\\(bh\u016bmidundubhi\\)), on which, with the tail of the victim, the priest made solemn music. With this usage may, of course, be compared the legends of the skin of Marsyas and of other sacred skins, like the \u00e6gis, collected by Dr. Frazer.\\(^2\\) But it is clear that the skin may equally well be regarded as the natural means of making a drum, nor need we be anxious to deny that the skin may have seemed particularly effective for its purpose because it had come from an animal which by sacrifice had come into close contact with divinity, and in a sense itself was not without a share in the divine.\\(^3\\)\n\nMore obscure is another rite mentioned in all the sources. To the left of the \u0100gn\u012bdhra priest were placed two posts on which was hung up as a target a completely round skin, or, according to L\u0101ty\u0101yana, two skins, one for the chief archer and the other for any others who were good shots. At one point in the ceremony the king or a R\u0101jput mounted the chariot, and driving round the Vedi pierced with three arrows the skin, leaving the arrows to stick in the skin.\n\nThe exact sense of this rite is by no means clear. It may possibly be compared with the Lapp ritual reported by Dr. Frazer.\\(^4\\) After slaying a bear with ceremonies intended to deprecate the wrath of the ghost and of the bear tribe, they hung its skin on a post and women blindfolded shot arrows at it, a custom comparable with the myth of the death of Balder and the blindness of H\u00f6dur, who slew him. But the parallel is hardly clear or cogent. In the Mah\u0101vrata there is no hint of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Also, in the Aitareya, a bull to Vi\u015bvakarman. The details vary; cf. Friedl\u00e4nder, op. cit., p. 30.\n\n\\(^2\\) Adonis, Attis, Osiris\\(^2\\), pp. 242 seq. For the \u00e6gis cf. Farnell, op. cit., i, 100; for the peculiar magic potentialities of the tail\u2014as the home of the vegetation spirit or for other reasons\u2014cf. Frazer, Golden Bough, i, 408; ii, 3, 42; Warde Fowler, op. cit., pp. 246, 247.\n\n\\(^3\\) For other examples of this idea in Vedic religion, cf. J.R.A.S., 1907, pp. 938 seq.; Maitr\u0101yani Samhit\u0101, iii, 7, 8; Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, ii, 3, 11.\n\n\\(^4\\) Golden Bough, ii, 360, n. 3.\nblindness; the archer is the best Bowman available, and the skin is nowhere stated to have been that of the sacrificial animal. On the contrary, it is described by \u0100pastamba\\(^1\\) as a 'dry' skin, and further there is no trace in the ritual of the animal being treated as anything more than a mere sacrificial victim on the gift theory of sacrifice, which notoriously is the one represented in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a texts as the normal one.\\(^2\\) If, therefore, there were ever any vegetation spirit in the rite, it has departed without leaving a clear trace of its presence.\n\nThe rite, therefore, still remains to be explained. The bow and the three arrows remind us of the ritual of the R\u0101jas\u016bya,\\(^3\\) in which the king shoots three arrows at the princes of his family as a token of superiority. The similarity of the picture suggests that the act is hostile rather than an act of sympathetic magic; otherwise we might have compared the shooting of the arrows with the custom of the Ojibways in firing fire-tipped arrows to rekindle the expiring light of the sun in an eclipse, or the practice of throwing blazing discs shaped like suns in the air in the Midsummer rites.\\(^4\\) But there is no hint here of fire-tipped arrows,\\(^5\\) and it is probably simplest and best to consider that the arrows are used to pierce the sky and bring down the rain. The round shape of the target can hardly be used as an argument against this view, for though round\u2014and, therefore, so far like the sun\u2014it is not claimed to have been white, nor is even its roundness mentioned in most of the authorities, nor indeed is there any difficulty in regarding the sky as circular, since even in the Rgveda it is compared to a wheel and to a bowl, while the earth itself, its counterpart, is described as circular.\\(^6\\) The question, however, still remains why the arrows are not allowed to go right through the skin, and the most plausible answer is perhaps that it was desired to\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cited in S\u0101yana on Aitareya \u0100ranyaka, v, 1, 5.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf. Caland & Henry, L\u2019Agni\u1e63\u1e6doma, App. iii. The only rival theory is that of the magic effect of the sacrifice, L\u00e9vi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, pp. 122 seq.\n\n\\(^3\\) Hillebrandt, Vedische Opfer und Zauber, p. 145.\n\n\\(^4\\) Frazer, Golden Bough, i, 22; ii, 268.\n\n\\(^5\\) Cf. for their later use in Epic war, Hopkins, J.A.O.S., xiii, 277, 298.\n\n\\(^6\\) Macdonell, op. cit., p. 9; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, ii, 93, n. 2.\nkeep open the rents in order that the rain might continue to fall; the arrow might be conceived as allowing enough room for the escape of the rain while still remaining in the wound.\n\nThe rite is therefore merely a rain-spell, and is perfectly compatible with a Midwinter date for the Mah\u0101vrata. Other parts of the ritual are also designed for the same end, notably the ceremonial washing of the swing,\\(^1\\) while the burning of the material whence had been formed the seats of the officiating priests is clearly a sun-spell, comparable with the lighting of bonfires at Christmas\\(^2\\) and at Midsummer. As the swing symbolises the sun, we may see, if we like, in its bathing another symbolism of the fertilising union of sun and water.\n\nIt would, of course, be useless to expect the Mah\u0101vrata to have survived in modern India, but it is not uninteresting to note that in the worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who unites, it seems most probable, in himself the attributes of sun-god (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u) and a vegetation spirit (perhaps non-Aryan), are found, on the 12th and 13th of January, rites including sun and fertility magic, and that, later, on the 14th of the light half of Ph\u0101lguna, takes place a dol\u0101y\u0101tr\u0101, in which the image of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is swung to and fro.\\(^3\\) Moreover, in Southern India,\\(^4\\) long the chief home of Brahmanism, in January, when the sun enters the tropic of Capricorn, there is celebrated the feast of Pongol, in which bonfires are made in every street and lane, and young people leap over the fire or pile on fresh fuel. The fire is an offering to S\u016brya or to Agni (the identification is parallel with that of \u0100ditya and Agni in the Vedic rite), and is purposed to awaken him to make glad the earth with his heat and light. The parallel to the Mah\u0101vrata is striking; the solemn dance round the fire of the maidens in the Vedic ritual is parallel with the less formal leap over the fire, and leaves little doubt that we need not see in the Mah\u0101vrata any priestly transformation of a Midsummer rite, but a genuine adoption into the priestly ritual of a popular festival. Nor, indeed, is it likely\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Aitareya \u0100ranyaka, v, 3, 2, with my note.\n\n\\(^2\\) Frazer, *Adonis, Attis, Osiris*, pp. 254 seq.\n\n\\(^3\\) Cf. Wilson, *Works*, ii, 216 seq., 225 seq.\n\n\\(^4\\) Glover, *J.R.A.S.*, 1870, pp. 96 seq.\nthat a rite so important as to force its way into the Brahminical ritual, and to cause them to allow women to play so conspicuous a part, could have been artificially altered in date.\n\nWe may, therefore, adhere to the view that the Mah\u0101vrata is a ritual of the Winter solstice, and that it combines within itself the characteristics of a spell to procure the heat of the sun and the fall of rain, so as to bring about fertility for the land, while more directly still it is designed to stimulate human and animal productiveness. In view of the early date of the rite\u2014and already in the Taittir\u012bya Sa\u1e43hit\u0101 and the K\u0101\u1e6dhaka Sa\u1e43hit\u0101 it is clearly recognised and so cannot be dated later than the eighth century B.C.\u2014it is of considerable interest that it contains no trace of a vegetation spirit such as can be found in ancient Mediterranean rituals, and this fact renders us entitled to be cautious before necessarily assuming that all these vegetation and fertility spells involved the conception of a vegetation spirit, an idea not readily verified in the other Vedic texts. No doubt in the later Hindu religion among its strange characteristics are many which depend on the idea of a vegetation spirit, but in such cases non-Aryan influence is certainly at work, either adding a new aspect of religious thought or bringing into the foreground an aspect which for some reason or another was not prominent in the mass of conceptions which may be termed Vedic religion.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 The original authorities are, Aitareya \u0100ranyaka, i and v; \u015a\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana \u0100ranyaka, i and ii; Taittir\u012bya Sa\u1e43hit\u0101, vii, 5, 9 and 10;
