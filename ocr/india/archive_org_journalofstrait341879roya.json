PICKERING.\n\nRead at a Meeting of the Society held on the 9th June 1879.\n\nHaving in the first number of this Journal, given an account of the origin and establishment of the \"Hung League\" or Thien-Te-Hui, I will now describe an initiatory ceremony, as actually witnessed by myself and others, in the best disciplined Lodge in Singapore, and which lasted from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m., during which period some seventy new Members were admitted into the Society.\n\nAs I have neither the time to re-translate in full, nor the ability to improve on M. Schlegel's version of the ritual, I shall describe the ceremonies and furniture of a Lodge, as I myself have seen them in Singapore; merely translating such portions as may seem necessary for my purpose, and, at times, taking the liberty of quoting from the \"Hung (or Ang *) League.\"\n\nAny reader wishing to become more minutely acquainted with the Thien-Te-Hui, should procure M. Schlegel's book, in which he will find a graphic description of the working, rules, and ceremonies of the Society, as (from all I hear) it now exists in China, and in semi-civilised Countries, where Chinese Colonists are compelled to combine against the unscrupulous and capricious tyranny of Native rulers.\n\nIn the Straits Settlements, the secret Societies are in fact, but large Friendly Societies, without political objects; dangerous no doubt, to a certain extent, but only for the reason that, owing to the nature of our Chinese population, each Hoey contains a large proportion of lawless and unprincipled characters.\n\n* In this paper I shall pronounce this word and all Chinese names according to the Hokken dialect.\nTheoretically, all Meetings of the \"League,\" are held in the jungle or mountains, and every new member is instructed to reply, when asked where he was initiated, \"In the mountains, for fear of the 'Chheng' Officials.\"\n\nIn the British Colony of the Straits Settlements, however, each Lodge has a substantial \"Hui-Koan\" (1) or Meeting-house; and at Singapore, the Grand Lodge possesses a very superior building at Rochore, where, twice a year, (on the 25th of the 1st and on the 25th of the 7th moons) the \"five ancestors\"* (2) are worshipped, and feasts, with theatricals, are held in their honour, by the following nine branches of the \"Ghee Hin\" Society:\n\n1 Hok-Kien Ghee Hin, (3)\n2 Hok-Hin, (4)\n3 Tie-Kun Ghee Hin, (5)\n4 Kwong Hok or Ghee Khee. (6)\n5 Siong-Peh-Koan, (7)\n6 Kwang-Hui-Siau, (8)\n7 Ghee Sin, (9)\n8 Ghee Hok, (10)\n9 Hailam Ghee Hin, (11)\n\nFor many years there has been no \"Toa-Ko\" (12) or Grand Master of the Ghee Hin Society, as no person dare come forward to undertake the onerous and responsible duties of the office, but each of the Branches is managed and governed by the following office bearers:\n\n1 Tsong-Li (13) or General Manager.\n1 Sien-Seng (14) or Master of Lodge.\n1 Sien-Hong (15) or Van-guard.\n1 Ang-Kun (16) Red B\u00e2ton or Executioner.\n\nand a varying number of Tsa-m-Hoa, (17) or Councillors, and Thih-pan Chhau-oe,\u00b6 (18) or District Head men, who carry out the orders of the superiors:\n\n* The five priests O-tek-te, Png-tai-ang, Chhoa tek-tiong, Ma-Chiau-hin and Li-sek-khai, who escaped from the burning of the Siau-Lim monastery.\n\n\u00b6 Iron planks, Grass-shoes.\nI. THE LODGE AND ITS FURNITURE.\n\nThe accompanying lithograph, taken from a native sketch, gives a very good idea of a Lodge arranged for a ceremony of initiation.\n\nJust inside the outer door of the Lodge is the famous Ang-Kun, (19) or Red B\u00e2ton, (a staff of 36 Chinese inches in length) which is used as an instrument of punishment, and from which one of the office-bearers derives his title.\n\nSo-Ang-Kuang (20) is on guard at the outer door, and any person wishing to enter the Lodge, must take up the B\u00e2ton with both hands, and repeat the following verse.\n\n\"In my hands I hold the red cane,\n\"On my way to the Lodge I've no fear,\n\"You ask me brother, whither I go,\n\"You come early, but I walked slow.\"\n\nAny stranger failing in this test, ought, according to the rules of the Society, to be beheaded at once.\n\nHaving gained entry, we come to the Ang Gate* (21) guarded on the right by Ban-To-hong (22) and on the left by Ban-To-liong (23).\n\nAbove the Gate, on each side, is a Flag, the two together bearing characters meaning, \"The barriers are open, the way is clear\"(24), and on the lintels is the couplet;\n\n\"Situate in the Ko range, where the Kh\u00e9 hills have branched forth for ages.*\n\n\"The Gate looks towards the great Ocean, into which the united waters of the\" three rivers,\u2020 have flowed during myriads of years.\n\nThe next stage, is the \"Hall of Sincerity and Justice,\" (25) guarded by Te\u207f-Ki-ju (26) on the right, and Tan-Teng-Seng (27) on the left. The two flags above, have the inscription, \"Dissipate revenge, and put away all malice\"(28). There is also on each side, a horizontal sentence, \"Two dragons disputing over a Pearl,\"(29) and \"Overturn the \"Chheng restore the Beng\"\n\nOn the door-posts is the antithetic couplet:\n\n\"Though a man be not a relation, if he be just, he is worthy of all honour.\n\n\"A friend, if he be found destitute of honour, ought to be repudiated.\"\n\nThe next step takes us to the \"City of Willows,\"(30) at\n\n* Ko-Kh\u00e9 is the name of the Temple where the 5 priests found a refuge.\n\u2020 Sam Ho.\n\n19 \u7d05\u68cd 22 \u842c\u9053\u82b3 25 \u5fe0\u7fa9\u5802 28 \u6d88\u51a4\u89e3\n20 \u8607\u7d05\u5149 23 \u842c\u9053\u9f8d 26 \u912d\u5176\u7531 29 \u4e8c\u9f8d\u722d\u4ec7\n21 \u6d2a\u9580 24 \u95dc\u958b\u8def\u73fe 27 \u9673\u5b9a\u6210 30 \u6728\u694a\u57ce\u73e0\nthe East Gate of which, Go-Kim-lai, (31) and Go-Hoan-ji (32) are the guardians. Practically, there is only one Gate represented in the Singapore Lodges, but theoretically, the city has a Gate at each point of the compass, guarded respectively by the ancient heroes,* Han-peng, (33) Han-Hok, (34) Ten-Chhan (35) and Li-chhang-kok, (36) whose flags adorn the City walls.\n\nThe couplet on the East Gate is,\n\n\"At the command of the General, the gate opens and myriads stream forth.\n\nThe awe-inspiring \"Ang\" heroes, guard the entrance to the \"Willow City.\"\n\nAlso the following.\n\n\"To the East, in the wood, it is difficult to walk quickly.\n\"The sun appearing above the hills, rises from the Eastern Ocean.\n\nOn the West Gate.\n\n\"In the metal road of the West, one must be careful.\n\"But of the two paths, the Western is more clear.\n\nOn the South Gate.\n\n\"The fiery South Road, is exceedingly hot.\nChang-Chiu, Chuan-Chiu, and Yen-ping.\u00a7 extend their protection as far as the Southern Capital.\n\nThe couplet of the North Gate \u2020 is,\n\n\"The Northern waters are deep and hard to cross.\nIn Yun-nan and Sze-Chuan there is a way by which we can pass.\"\n\nEntering the East Gate of the \"City of Willows,\" we come to the \"Red flowery Pavilion,\"(37) before which Chiang Kiet-hin (38) dispenses the purifying waters of the Sam-Ho, (39) or three Rivers, to the new members.\n\nAbove the Pavilion is the Grand Altar,(40) with the pulpit of the Sien-Seng, or Master of the Lodge; and on the East side, is the \"Circle of Heaven and Earth,\"(41) with its couplet.\n\n\"Agitate Heaven and Earth, and reform the world.\n\"Let the \"Beng\" triumph, and let righteousness obtain throughout the Empire.\n\n* See \"Hung League\" p. 21.\n\u00a7 Prefectures of Hok-Kien,\n\u2020 According to Chinese ideas the 4 cardinal points and the centre represent the 5 elements, viz.: E. wood, W. metal, S. fire, N. water, centre, earth.\n\n31 \u5433\u91d1\u4f86 34 \u97d3\u798f 37 \u7d05\u82b1\u4ead 40 \u58c7\n32 \u5433\u559a\u5152 35 \u912d\u7530\u570b 38 \u8523\u7d50\u8208 41 \u4e7e\u5764\u5708\n33 \u97d3\u670b 36 \u674e\u660c 39 \u4e09\u6cb3\nPassing through the Circle, out of the West door of the \"Pavilion,\" we reach the \"Two Planked Bridge,\" guarded by the spirits of deceased brethren, \"Kiet-Beng-pu\"(42) and \"Ban-Bun-beng,\"*(43) whose \"spirit throne\"(44) or tablet, is on the left side of the bridge-head. On this tablet is the inscription.\n\n\"When will the day of vengeance arrive?\nUntil then, we will cherish our resentment, though it be myriads of years.\n\nThe right hand plank of the Bridge is supposed to be of copper, and that on the left, of iron.\n\nAt the bridge-head is the couplet.\n\n\"Staggering across, we leave no traces behind.\n\"While all creation is silently expectant, seeing that the day is already beginning to be red.\u00a7\n\nIn the centre of the Bridge, underneath.\n\n\"A true prince will accomplish everything he takes in hand.\n\"A true man will bring to perfection all he undertakes to do.\n\nOn the Bridge, are hung, \"Ang\" (45) coin to the value of 30,821\u00b6 cash, and underneath are three stepping-stones, arranged in a triangular figure, over which we pass to the \"Fiery valley\"(46) or \"Red Furnace,\"(47) guarded by a malignant though just spirit, called the \"Red youth,\"(48) who enviously scrutinises the hearts of all who approach him, and mercilessly slays all traitors with his spear, and consigns their souls to the flames.\n\nAccording to the testimony of the Head men, many victims have fallen by his spear in Singapore.\n\nHaving passed scatheless through this ordeal, we arrive at the \"Market of Universal Peace,\"(49) and the \"Temple of Virtue and Happiness,\"(50) which are at the end of our dangerous journey.\n\nIn the market is Chia-pang-heng (51) who sells the precious \"Ang\" fruits, of five kinds, and in the Temple, besides the inscription already noticed on the 'Spirit throne of deceased brethren,\" is the following couplet.\n\n\"In this happy place, if there be any impurity, the wind will cleanse it away.\n\n* Kiet-Ban, the associated myriads.\n\u00a7 (Ang \u7d05 red, and Ang \u6d2a the surname of the League.)\n\u00b6 The character (\"Ang\" \u6d2a) is composed of the characters which can represent 3-8-21.\n\n42 \u7d50\u660e\u5bcc 45 \u6d2a\u9322 48 \u7d05\u5b69\u5b50 51 \u8b1d\u90a6\u884c\n43 \u842c\u6587\u660e 46 \u706b\u5751 49 \u592a\u5e73\u58c7\n44 \u4ea1\u5144\u6545\u5f1f\u795e\u4f4d 47 \u7d05\u7210 50 \u798f\u5fb7\u5bfa\n\"In this virtuous family there will be no trouble; the Sun will continually illumine the door.\"\n\nII. The Ceremony.\n\nIn a room convenient to the Lodge, on the right of the \"Market of Universal Peace,\" the candidates having purified their bodies by ablution, and wearing clean clothes, are prepared for admission.\n\nEach candidate must be introduced by an office-bearer, who is supposed to be responsible for him, that during four months, the new member (52) shall not even come to words with the brethren, and that for the term of three years, he shall not break the more important of the 36 articles of the Society's Oath.\n\nExperience however shows, that this obligation sits very lightly on both new members and Head-men, at any rate amongst the class which now-a-days composes the Societies.\n\nEach candidate having paid a fee of $3.50, ($2 of which go to the treasury of the Lodge, while the balance is expended in fees to office-bearers, and in the expenses of the evening), his surname, name, age, place and hour of birth, are entered on the Register of the Society, and copied on a sheet of Red paper.\n\nIn token of having cast off all allegiance to the present dynasty \"Chheng,\" the \"queue\" of each is unbraided, and the hair allowed to flow loosely down the back, the right shoulder and breast are bared, and the candidate is not allowed to retain a single article on his person, except a jacket and short trousers.\n\nIn consideration of the poverty of most of the newcomers, they are not required to put on new clothes, but newly-washed raiment is insisted upon.\n\nThe Sien-Seng, Sien-Hong, Ang-Kun, and the Chhau-oes who act the parts of the Generals guarding the gates &c., must, however, dress in new clothes on every occasion.\n\nAfter preparing the candidates, the Master proceeds to arrange the articles on the Grand altar, the most important part of this duty being the insertion of all the paraphernalia in the \"Peck measure,\"* or Ang Tau.\"(53)\n\n---\n\n* Nearly always, though erroneously, spoken of as the Bushel.

In front of these, is the \"nine storied precious pagoda.\"\n\nTwo charms are pasted on the front of the \"Peck-measure,\" and the \"Tau\" is then elevated, and placed on the West side of the Altar, the Sien-Seng repeating the following stanza.\n\n\"We have newly established the City of Willows.\"\n\"And the heroes of 'Ang' are assembled to-night.\"\n\"Shields and Spears are piled up high.\"\n\"Overturn Chheng and then restore the Beng.\" \u2014 (Schlegel.)\n\nOn the Altar, in front, or to the East of the \"Tau,\" are placed 5 cups of Tea, 5 cups of Wine, 5 bowls of Rice, 5 pairs of chop-sticks, the 3 sacrificial meats, Pork, fowl, and duck, 1 paper of tobacco, 1 paper of tea, 7 Lamps for the seven Stars, and 1 pair of large red candles. In front of these, is the \"precious censer,\" in which are five stalks of grass,\u2014and a purifying charm.\n\nThe Altar thus being arranged, the Sien-Seng goes outside the \"Ang Gate,\" and calling over the names of the candidates, explains to them the origin and objects of the Society, by reciting the history of the subjugation of the Western Eleuths, as described in my last paper.\n\nOn the occasions on which I have been present at the meetings of Lodges, the master has further addressed his hearers, in the following manner:\n\n\"Many of our oaths and ceremonies are needless, and obsolete, as under the British Government there is no necessity for some of the rules, and the laws of this country do not allow us to carry out others; the ritual is however retained for old custom's sake.\n\n\"The real benefits you will receive by joining our Society, are, that if outsiders oppress you, or in case you get into trouble, on application to the Headmen, they will in minor cases take you to the Registrars of Secret Societies, the Inspector General of Police, and the Protector of Chinese, who will certainly assist you to obtain redress; in serious cases, we will assist you towards procuring Legal advice.\"\n\nAlthough this kind of address was no doubt intended\n\n* See \"Journal\" June 1878 pp. 82 & 84.\n\u2020 \"Giok-Hong\" a deity of the \"Sung\" dynasty.\nfor my benefit, it really describes the way in which most of the Societies in Singapore manage their affairs, and certainly quarrels nowadays, only arrive at any magnitude when the Head-men are helpless and incompetent.\n\nThe majority of the principal office-bearers of the Singapore Societies, honestly desire to keep their men in order, and themselves out of trouble, and the quarrels which occasionally grow into small riots, would, amongst such a heterogeneous Chinese population as that of this Colony, continually occur, were there no Secret Societies in existence. There is this difference however;\u2014under Ords. XIX of 1869, and V of 1877 we are able to exercise a wholesome control of the Chiefs of Hoeys, while if the Secret Societies were abolished, we should have no check at all on the thousands of the disorderly class of Chinese.\n\nIn my opinion, it would be impossible to rule China by British law; much more so, the three or four hundred thousand Chinese in our Colony, who, (except a small proportion) the scum of the Empire, and coming from different Provinces, Prefectures, and Districts, of their native land, speak dialects and sub-dialects unintelligible to each other; while all are ignorant of the language and motives of the governing nation.\n\nOur freedom,\u2014the germs of which were brought into Britain by our English forefathers,\u2014(in deference to Mr. Freeman I do not use the word Anglo-Saxon) has been gradually developed during more than a thousand years, at the expense of many of the noblest of our race, who have given up their lives for the good cause, in the field, and on the scaffold.\n\nThe Chinese, on the contrary, is accustomed from infancy to lean upon, or to dread, some superior and ever present power, either in the shape of his Government, his clan, or the village elders. I do not think any persons will say that they find anything of the sort in our complicated, and to the Chinaman, (who comes here at a mature age with his prejudices and habits confirmed) inexplicable course of Law.\n\nIf some such system as those in force in the Dutch, French, or Spanish Colonies, is incompatible with our constitution and laws, I can see no other way of ruling Chinese, than by recognising the secret Societies, and by immediately commencing the training of a competent staff of officials, conversant with the Chinese language, and mode of thought, to supervise and control them.\n\nI am aware that these views are almost diametrically opposed to those I advanced in Frasers Magazine, some\nthree years ago; but at that time I fondly hoped that the Government would see its way to exceptional and more stringent legislation, for an exceptional population. As my hopes have proved fallacious, I have been obliged to change my opinions.\n\nReturning to the subject of this paper;\u2014I have been informed by many old office-bearers of Societies, that 40 years ago, the punishments of the League were carried out in their integrity, and that on one occasion, some strangers (in the slang of the Society \"draughts of wind\") (93) were actually beheaded for intruding on a meeting held in the jungle. As to the power of Secret Societies in those days, I have been told by a man who professes to have been in Singapore at the time, that a single member of the \"Kwan-te Society,\" (94) released 75 of his brethren who had been confined in Jail for some outrage.\n\nAt the present time, I am sure the Headmen dare not even use the \"Red Baton\" seriously, and no Society would dare to think of making a combined effort against the Government.\n\nAfter the address to the new members, the Sien Seng explains to them the various secret signs and pass-words of the Society, which are of great use to the Chinese who travel in the Native States, and through the Archipelago. At a meeting of initiation, these secrets are however only revealed in a very elementary manner; a familiar knowledge of them can only be obtained by attending Lodges of Instruction, which are frequently held, and which as in the case of all meetings, are duly notified to the Government.\n\nHaving delivered his address, and finished his instructions, the Master unbraids his queue, and puts on a suit of clothes, and a turban of pure white; the \"Chhan-o's acting as Generals are also arrayed in white costume, but have red turbans, and straw shoes laced over white stockings, something in the style of the pictures of Italian bandits.\"\n\nThe Master, (Tan Kin-lan) with right shoulder bare, enters the \"Ang Gate,\" and passes through the \"Hall of Sincerity and Justice,\" and the East Gate of the \"City of Willows,\" (at each stage repeating an appropriate verse) until he arrives in front of the altar above the \"Red-flowery Pavilion;\" here, he lights the \"Jewelled Emperor Lamps,\" uses the two pieces of touchwood as candles, lights the 7-star lamps, and burns a charm to drive all evil spirits from the Lodge. He then with a sprig of pomegranate and a cup\nof pure water, sprinkles the altar at the four points of the compass, to cleanse the offerings from all impurity. After this, the Master takes out the five stalks of grass, and lighting them as (incense-sticks) replaces each with a profound obeisance, in the \"Precious Censer\" before the Tablet of the \"Five Ancestors.\"\n\nThis being done, he lights 15 incense-sticks, and holding them between his outstretched palms, kneels down, making the following invocation to the Chinese Pantheon, and knocking his head on the ground at the mention of the names of the most august deities or spirits.\n\n\"At this moment, being the\u2014\u2014\u2014hour, of the\u2014\u2014\u2014day, of the\u2014\u2014\u2014moon of the Cyclical year,\u2014\u2014\u2014, I\u2014\u2014\u2014, open this our\u2014\u2014\u2014Lodge, of the Ghee Hin Society, established in\u2014\u2014\u2014Street, in the British country of Singapore, for the purpose of expelling the 'Cheng' and of re-establishing the 'Beng' dynasty,\u2014humbly imploring Heaven that its intentions may flow in unison with our own.\"\n\n\"In the 'pear garden' of the\u2014\u2014\u2014Lodge, of the Ghee Hin Society of Singapore, our leader will this night bring new brethren to receive the commands of Heaven, and with iron livers and copper galls, to unite themselves in an oath by the mixing of blood, in imitation of the ancient worthies Lau, Koan, and Tiun.\"\n\n\"We are all agreed with our whole hearts, to obey Heaven and walk righteously, and to use our utmost exertions, to restore our native hills and rivers to the 'Beng' dynasty, that its heir may sit on the Imperial Thone, for ever and ever.\"\n\nThe Buddhist and Tauist Gods, angels, and spirits, with the five Ancestors, the five Tiger Generals, and the four ancient worthies, are then invoked to descend, at such a monotonous length, that I must refer the reader again to M. Schlegel's book for a minute account.\n\nThe invocation concludes as follows:\n\n\"This night we pledge that the brethren in the whole universe, shall be as from one womb, as begotten by one Father, and nourished by one Mother; that we will obey Heaven and work righteousness;\u2014that our faithful hearts shall never change. If august Heaven grants that the 'Beng' be restored, then happiness will return to our land.\"\n\nAfter this, the Sien-Seng pours out libations of tea and wine, and sacrifices to the Standard; this being done, he\nmounts his pulpit or throne on the North of the altar, and orders Ban-To-hong and Ban-To-liong to guard the \u201cAng Gate\u201d; Tan-Teag-seng and Ten Ki-iu to the \u201cHall of Sincerity and Justice\u201d; Go Kim-lai, and Go Hoan-ji to the East Gate of the \u201cCity of Willows.\u201d Each of these Generals is presented with a small triangular warrant flag, which is stuck behind his head; and a sword or \u201ciron plank.\u201d\n\nChiang Kiet-hin with the water of the \u201cSam-ho\u201d or three rivers, is ordered to take up his station in front of the Pavilion; Kiet Ban-pu and Ban Bun-beng, each being armed with a sword, are sent to the \u201cTwo-planked Bridge.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cRed Boy,\u201d (his face well rouged and a circular frame as a halo, round his head) armed with a spear, is posted at the \u201cRed furnace,\u201d and old Chia Pang-heng is stationed to sell fruit in the \u201cmarket of Universal Peace.\u201d\n\nThe guards being set, an alarm is given from the \u201cAng Gate,\u201d outside of which the candidates are squatted on their hams, waiting admission.\n\nThe Master, Tan Kin-lam, orders the General of the main body, Tun Thien-hoai, to go out and see the cause of the alarm; in a short while Thien-hoai returns, saying:\u2014\n\n\u201cMay it please the worshipful Master, the Vanguard General Thien Iu-ang is without, having the secret sign and password, and he humbly begs an interview with the Five Ancestors.\u201d\n\nThe Master having granted permission, the Sien-Hong or Vanguard, enters the gate, and having repeated the appropriate verse at each barrier, passes into the city, and falls prostrate before the altar.\n\nThe Sien-Seng then catechises him thus.\n\nQ. \u201cThe five ancestors are above, but who is this prostrate beneath me\u201d?\n\nA. \u201cI am Thien Iu-Ang of the Ko-Khe Temple\u201d\n\nQ. \u201cWhat proof can you shew of this\u201d?\n\nA. \u201cI have a verse, as a proof\u201d\n\nQ. \u201cWhat is the verse?\u201d\n\nA. \u201cI am indeed Thien Iu-Ang, bringing myriads of new troops into the City.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat they to-night in the Pear Garden may take the oath of brotherhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole Empire desires to take the surname Ang.\u201d\n\nQ. For what do you come here?\u201d\n\nA. \u201cTo worship the Thien Te-hui.\u201d\nQ. \"What proof do you bring?\"\nA. \"I have this verse:\u2014\n\"Heaven produced the Sun-Moon Lord, (Beng) whose surname is Ang.\"\n\"But from North to South the Wind has blown him where it listed.\n\"All the heroic brethern of Ang are now associated together, to restore the rightful dynasty.\n\"Waiting for the dragon to appear, when they will burst open the barriers, and overturn the Chheng.\"\nQ. \"Why do you wish to worship the Heaven and Earth Society?\"\nA. \"In order that we may drive out the Chheng and restore our Beng.\"\nQ. \"Have you any proof?\"\nA. \"I have this verse:\u2014\n\"We have searched the origin, and enquired exhaustively into the cause.\n\"And find that the Chheng took from us by force our native land.\n\"Following our leaders, we will now restore the Empire.\n\"The glory of the Beng shall appear, and the reign of righteousness shall be established.\"\nQ. \"Do you know that there is a great and a small Heaven and Earth Society?\"\nA. \"Yes, the great Society originated in Heaven, and the lesser at the waters of the three rivers (Sam Ho.)\"\nQ. \"How can you prove this?\"\nA. \"By the following verse:\u2014\n\"Our society was originally established at the Sam Ho.\n\"And multitudes of brethren took the oath of allegiance.\n\"On the day when the principles of Heaven shall be carried out.\n\"Our whole Family shall sing the hymn of Universal Peace.\"\nQ. \"From whence do you come?\"\nA. \"I come from the East.\"\nQ. \"What evidence do you bring?\"\nA. \"I have this verse:\u2014\n\"This sun and moon issuing from the East, clearly. (Beng.)\n\"The army is composed of countless myriads of the Ang\nheroes.\"\n\n\"To overturn the Chheng and restore Beng is the duty of all good men.\"\n\n\"And their sincerity and loyalty will at last be rewarded by rank and emolument.\"\n\nThe catechism is continued to the length of 333 questions,* to each of which the Vanguard must give suitable answers and verses, describing the history and ceremonial of the Society. It is really astonishing to hear a clever Sien Hong give every answer and verse correctly, without referring to a Book, or requiring any assistance from the Master, who has the Ritual before him on the altar.\n\nThis part of the ceremony lasts nearly an hour, during which time the Vanguard is kneeling before the spirits of the five ancestors, who are supposed to have descended into their tablet on the altar.\n\nThe Sien-Seng now addresses the Sien-Hong as follows.\n\n\"Having thoroughly examined you, I find that by your satisfactory replies, you have proved yourself to be the real Thien Ju-ang; the five ancestors graciously accept your answers and petition, so kotow, and return thanks for their benevolent condescension.\"\n\nThe vanguard having performed the \"Kotow,\" returns thanks as follows.\n\n\"I humbly thank the pure (Beng) spirits of our five ancestors, and beg that they will assist the Ang children to slay the Chheng. To-night having been permitted to have an interview with the five Founders, I have a firm hope that the spirits will help us to restore the great dynasty of Beng.\"\n\nThe Master then says; \"I now present you with this precious sword and a warrant; all the candidates who are found to be faithful and sincere, you may bring within the City to take the oath of fidelity; but those whom you may find to be tratoirs you must take outside the Gate, and behead.\" Presenting the sword and warrant flag, he repeats this verse.\n\n\"The five Ancestors present you with this sword and commission.\n\n\"To be worn on your person while collecting material of war.\n\n\"And whilst gathering the brethren from within the Four Seas.\n\n* See the \"Hung League.\"\n\"To bring them to the Flowery Pavilion, that they may be thoroughly instructed in their duties.\"\n\nThe Sien Hong then goes outside the \"Ang Gate,\" saying on his way,\n\n\"The five Ancestors have bestowed on me this Flag.\n\"Authorising me to bring new members within the City moat.\n\"In a true man, sincerity and loyalty are the most important characteristics,\n\"You must on no account on returning home, divulge the secrets of this night.\"\n\nThe new members in pairs, now enter the \"Ang Gate,\" kneeling down in the attitude of prayer, with burning incense-sticks between their out-stretched palms, the lighted ends towards the ground.\n\nGenerals Ban To-hong and To-liong, with their swords forming an arch over the Gate, ask their respective candidates.\n\n1. \"What is your surname and name?\"\n2. \"In what Province, Prefecture, and District, were you born?\"\n3. \"What is your age?\"\n4. \"What is the cyclical character of the hour of your birth?\"\n\nThese questions being satisfactorily answered, each Sin Kheh repeats the following formula after the General who prompts him.\n\n\"I now of my own free-will, enter the\u2014\u2014\u2014branch of the Ghee Hin Society established in the British Coun-try of Singapore, and will use my utmost endeavours, to drive out the Chheng, and establish the Beng dynasty. I promise to obey the laws of the British Government, and to follow the instructions of the Registrars of our Society, The Inspector General of Police and the Protector of Chinese. I also promise to obey the 36 articles of the Society's oath, and to appear whenever called upon by the Head men of this Lodge. If I fail to carry out each and every particular of this my oath, may I perish, and be extinguished as this incense-stick is now extinguished.\"\n\nAt this, the incense sticks of both new members are plunged into the earth, and extinguished. This formula is gone through three times, by each Sin-Kheh, after which the Generals say;\n\n\"What are these we hold over you?\"\nA. \"The swords of Sincerity and Justice.\"\nQ. \"For what are they used?\"\nA. \"To behead traitors.\"\nQ. Which are the harder, these swords or your necks?\nA. \"As our hearts are truly loyal and sincere, our necks are harder than your sword.\" With a loud voice the Generals say, \"Pass on,\" and the same ceremony is exactly repeated at the \"Hall of Sincerity and Justice,\" and at the \"Gate of the City of the Willows;\" where, as this paper has grown to an unconscionable length, I must leave them for the present.\n\nI am not of course blind to the fact, that the parts of the oath relating to obedience to British law, and to the Registrars of the Societies, were probably introduced in deference to the presence of official foreign visitors, though I have good reason to believe that new members are warned to obey the Colonial laws, and so keep their chiefs out of trouble.\n\nFor some years I have strongly discountenanced the use of the words \"Ang-mo\" or \"Red haired,\" for \"English,\" except in those unavoidable cases when a \"freshly caught\" Sin Kheh would be totally unable to understand any other term.\n\nI have no doubt that on occasions when I have been present at meetings, special instructions have been given to the \"Generals,\" to avoid the objectionable expression, and to use the words \"Eng-kok\" or \"Tai-Eng-kok\" for English or British, as also to give the proper titles to local Officials. It is however an unpleasant fact that the Chinese in designating foreign officials, use terms somewhat less complimentary than those to be found in the appendix to Mayers' \"Chinese Government\"; Inspectors of Police for instance, are called \"big dogs,\" and the Superintendent of that body has no higher title than that of \"Head of the big-dogs.\" Inspectors of Nuisances are called \"Earth buffaloes,\" and so on. At the meeting above described, it was most amusing to hear the \"Generals\" correcting themselves when guilty of a lapsus linguae, or to see the austere visage of a \"Guardian\" relax, as he called out to a \"General\" fresh from the jungle, \"You fool! they will be angry if you say Ang mo; you must only say 'Eng-kok.'\" As for the candidates, the effort to comprehend such words, as the Chinese equivalents for \"British Government,\" and \"Inspector General of Police,\" was evidently too much for them, and seemed to be an even more severe ordeal than the drawn swords under which they had to pass.\nShould the members of this Society feel an interest in the further progress of the candidates, I hope on a future occasion, to describe the ceremony, including the taking of the oath, the mixing and drinking of the blood, and the beheading of the \"traitorous Minister.\"\nMALAY PROVERBS.\n\nBY W.

A maxim quoted sententiously by Malay advisers when some important step is being discussed prior to action being taken.\n\nA somewhat similar one, \"Meniesal dahulu jadi pendapatan, meniesal kamdian apa ta guna.\" To repent first is gain, to repent afterwards is useless), will be found, in a slightly different form, in Klinkert's collection.\n\nA Malay newspaper which I saw lately quoted the proverb in the following versified form.\n\nBesar pilang dengan apitan\nBesar galah apa gunania\n\"Sesah dahulu pendapatan\nSesal kamdian apa gunania.\"\n\n208. Apa gadohkan? pengayu sama di tangan, prahu sama di ayer.\n\n\"Why be quarrelsome? We have each got paddles in our hands and boats in the water.\"\nA phrase to express readiness to fight, when two Malay chiefs, each of whom \"lalu buat\" (is capable of taking the offensive), cannot settle their disputes amicably.\n\n209. *Alah bisa buat biasa.*\n\n\"Venom loses the day when met by experience.\" Hatred and prejudice are powerless in proportion as familiarity with the position gives the person against whom they are directed the means of counteracting them.\n\nQuoting this proverb (not without political significance), an old Perak Malay once called my attention to the eagle on the Mexican dollar, which is represented as holding a snake in its talons. The skilful way in which bird, guided by instinct, holds its adversary in a position in which it cannot use its venomed fangs seemed to the Malay to illustrate his text admirably.\n\n210. *Orang kaya jangan digan.*\n*Orang miskin jangan dihina.*\n\n\"Do not worship the rich or contemn the poor.\"\nBe contented with thy lot.\n*Gan*, to admire, pay court to, fawn upon.\n\n211. *Orang berdendang di pentasnia.*\n*Orang beraja di hatinia.*\n\n\"A man sings on his own sleeping-place and is sovereign in his own heart.\"\n\n\"A man of a contented mind will make himself happy in his own way.\n\n*Pentas*, a sleeping platform, is a less elaborate bedstead than the *geta* and *katil* used by well-to-do Malays.\n\n212. *Usahlah teman di mandi pagi.*\n\n\"You need not wait on me at the morning ablutions.\n\nSaid in deprecation of open flattery. It is a mark of respect and solicitude among Malays, as among other Eastern nations, to attend another to the bath, to wash his feet or clothes, to rub or shampoo him etc. Often these attentions are not altogether disinterested, but are paid to a guest or stranger from whom the operator hopes to get some advan-\ntage. Hence this blunt saying \"You need not come to my morning bath\" which is equivalent to \"I see through your flattery.\"\n\n*Teman* is here used for the personal pronoun. In this sense it is commonly used in Perak between persons whose rank is the same or nearly so. This implied equality of rank characterises the word when it is used in the significance of \"a companion\" or \"to accompany,\" a point which is missed, I think, in Favre's dictionary. To accompany as a *teman* is \"to accompany for a short way,\" *i.e.* as a friend, or as a mark of politeness.\n\n213. *Ayam terlepas tangan bawa tahi.*\n\n\"The fowl has escaped and the hand is left dirty.\"\n\nSaid in ridicule of a person who loses something which he looked upon as secured and finds himself an object of general derision, *e.g.* a Malay whose fianc\u00e9e, after all the preliminaries have been arranged, jilts him and marries another.\n\n214. *Bagei si-kudong dapat chin-chin.*\n\n\"Like finding a ring to one who has lost his hand.\" (Lit. Like the lopped-one who gets a ring).\n\nA sarcastic phrase aimed at persons who come in for a stroke of good fortune which their humble condition and habits of life prevent them from turning to account.\n\n215. *Bagei bersuloh tengah hari.*\n\n\"Like carrying a light in the daytime.\"\n\nUnnecessary trouble or waste of power, \"idle and ridiculous excess.\"\n\n216. *Bagei petei sisa pengait.*\n\n\"Like *petei* beans, the leavings of the hook.\"\n\nNot worth the trouble of taking, like the pods left here and there on the tree after the crop has been plucked.\n\n*Petei* \"cet arbre (*Parkia speciosa*) produit une esp\u00e8ce de \"gros haricots que les naturels mangent comme hors \"d'\u0153uvre, malgr\u00e9 leur odeur forte et d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able.\" Favre, *Anagyris* L., Marsden.\n217. Bagei kuniet dengan kapor.\n\n\"Like turmeric when it meets lime.\"\n\nA simile illustrative of the close sympathy and feeling existing between two intimate friends. (sama sarati or sama sajodo.) Malays say that the prepared lime used with betelnut, if it is touched with turmeric, is at once stained with a bright yellow colour which spreads through the whole mass.\n\n218. Ber-telan-telan bagei panas di belukar.\n\n\"Striking unequally like sunshine in a thicket.\" See No. 189.\n\nBer-lelan-telan, marked in spots, unevenly or unequally; e.g. a paper stained with oil spilt upon it may be said to be bertelan-telan.\n\n219. Bagi kapak masok meminang.\n\n\"Like an axe undertaking marriage negotiations.\" The axe seems to be a popular figure to denote rough, coarse conduct. The extreme of roughness is reached when the uncompromising instrument is imagined engaging in affairs in which domestic diplomacy and politeness exhaust themselves.\n\n220. Bagei jampok ka-siangan hari.\n\n\"Like an owl in the daytime.\"\n\nTo sit mute and foolish, like a man who has suffered a public rebuke in the Majlis, or assembly, for improper speech or conduct.\n\n221. Bingong ta'dapat diajar, cherdek ta'dapat diikut.\n\n\"In his folly he is not to be corrected, in his shrewdness he is not be followed.\" Or, less literally,\n\n\"Impatient of instruction where he is ignorant, and an unsafe guide where he possesses shrewdness.\"\n\nA proverbial phrase to describe (and condemn) a type of character to be met with among Malays as among other nations.\n\n222. Bersarak sarasi hilang, bercherei sarasi mati.\n\n\"Parting feels like loss, separation feels like death,\"\nA sentiment, tinged with the necessary amount of Oriental exaggeration, to express excessive affection.\n\n223. Bir titeh jangan tumpah.\n\"Lose a drop so long as you do not spill the whole.\"\n\nIt is wise to sacrifice a little if thereby the loss of the whole can be prevented. A similar expression is \"Takut titeh lalu tumpah.\" \"From fear of losing a drop the whole is spilt.\"\n\n224. Burong yang liar jangan di lepaskan,\nKhabar yang mustehil jangan di dengarkan.\n\"Do not let loose an untamed bird,\nHearken not to impossible stories.\"\n\nTo give circulation to idle rumours is like setting a wild bird at liberty. You don't know where it may settle next.\n\n225. Busut juga di tambun anei-anei.\n\"Hillocks even are piled up by white ants.\"\nGreat things may be achieved by perseverance.\n\n226. Berpesan berturut, berserah berkahandak hati.\n\"To commission another and then accompany him; to hand over a thing and then long for it back again.\"\n\nQuoted in ridicule of an uncertain and capricious disposition.\n\n227. Badan bersudara mas ta'kan sudara,\nKasih sudara sama ada,\nKasih bapa menokoh harta yang ada,\nKasih mah samata (sama rata) jalan;\nKasih sahabat sama binasa.\nRelationship is of the body, there is no relationship of gold; the love of mere relations is equal on both sides; a father's love adds to the store (of his children); a mother's love follows them every where, but the love which exists between friends is such that they will die together.\n\n228. Barang dimana pun pantat priuk itu hitam juga.\n\"Whatever you may do, the bottom of the pot will still be black.\"\nYou cannot make the African white. A person of low origin will always carry about the evidence of it with him.\n\n229. Buat nasi tambah.\n\n\u201cTo provide a supplementary dish of rice.\u201d\n\nTo have concubines as well as the lawful number of wives. At a Malay feast the guests are helped to rice by the attendants, but a large dish of rice is set before them as well, from which they are at liberty to help themselves when they feel inclined. This is called nasi tambah.\n\n230. Bir puteh tulang jangan puteh mata.\n\n\u201cLet the bones whiten, but not the eyes!\u201d\n\nDeath before dishonour.\n\n231.

As it swims along among the thorny *mangkuang* leaves, which dip into a pool, it bends gracefully over from side to\nside as if to avoid the thorns. These fish are very plentiful in Kedah and about Kuala Muda where they are salted and exported.\n\n241. *Ter-nanti-nanti bagei berlaki-kan rajah.*\n   \u201cPut off repeatedly, as if a royal wedding were in progress.\u201d\n\nAn allusion to the proverbial unpunctuality of Malay Rajas.\n\n242. *Ter-layang-layang bagei bulu sa\u2019lei.*\n   \u201cWafted about like a feather.\u201d\n\nAlways alone, wherever fortune may send him or whatever business he may undertake.

The two lines above quoted are applied proverbially to some one whose luck has abandoned him or his family, and who is now experiencing the frowns of fortune. The phrase occurs in the *Undang-undang* of Perak, with a number of others inculcating the hopelessness of avoiding predestined misfortune.\n\n*Lambong* is an expression used for the start given to a kite by the person who launches it upwards.\n\n249. *Ter-kejar-kejar bagei kuching jatoh anak.*\n\"Hunting about like a cat which has dropped a kitten.\"\n\nSaid of the movements of a person who bustles about in a flurried and excited manner.\n\n250. *Turut hati yang gram hilang takut timbul brani.*\n\"If you give way to a fiery temper prudence disappears and boldness succeeds it.\"\nThe best commentary on this maxim is the advice of an old Malay, \"go into a new country as hens, not as cocks. If you go as cocks, ready to take offence at everything, you will not be there for three months before there is some fatal collision.\"\n\n251. Tampat makan jangan di berak.\n\n\"Do not pollute the place where you have eaten.\"\n\nA homely and common proverb conveying an injunction to gratitude. Do not return evil for good, or bite the hand that feeds you.\n\n252. Tega sudah berdiri habis.\n\n\"Nothing to do but to stand up.\"\n\nReady to start at a moment's notice with no preparations to make.\n\n253. Ta'bertepat janji, ta'bertiban taroh, ta'bertangkap mangmang, alah di darat sahja.\n\n\"He who does not keep his appointment, who does not put down his stakes, or who does not accept the challenge is defeated before ever the water is reached.\"\n\nAn allusion to the various incidents of the ordeal by diving, a method of deciding a disputed point which was occasionally resorted to in Perak in former times. I got the following account of the manner of conducting the ordeal from a Malay chief who saw it carried out once at Tanjong Sanendang near Pasir Sala in the reign of Sultan Abdullah Mohamed Shah, father of the present Raja Muda Yusuf.\n\nThe ordeal by diving requires the sanction of the Sultan himself and must be conducted in the presence of the Orang Besar Ampat, or Four Chiefs of the first rank. If two disputants in an important question agree to settle their difference in this way they apply to the Raja who fixes a day (usually three days off) for the purpose, and orders that a certain sum of money shall abide the event. This appointment of time and place is the first stage in the proceedings and is called bertepat janji and the laying of the bet or deposit of stakes is called bertiban taroh. On the day appointed the parties attend with their friends at the Raja's balei and there, in the presence of the Court, a krani writes down a solemn declaration for each person, each maintaining t\u00f8q\ntruth of his side of the question. The first, invoking the name of God, the intercession of the Prophet and the tombs of the deceased Sultans of the country, asserts the affirmative proposition, and his adversary with the same solemnity records his denial. This is called *bertangkap mangmang* or \"taking up the challenge.\" Each paper is then carefully rolled up by the *krani* and is placed by him in a separate bamboo tube; the ends of both are then sealed up. When thus prepared the bamboo tubes are exactly alike and no one, not even the *krani*, can tell which contains the assertion, and which the denial. Two boys are then selected, one of the bamboos is given to each, and they are led down to the river, where the Raja and Chiefs take up their station, and the people flock down in crowds. Two stakes have been driven into the bed of the river in a pool previously selected, and the boys are placed beside them, up to their necks in water. A pole is placed horizontally on their heads, and on a given signal this is pressed downwards and the boys are made to sink at the same moment. Each holds on to his post under water and remains below as long as he can. As soon as one gives in and appears above water his bamboo tube is snatched from him and hurled far out into the stream. The victor is led up in triumph to the *balei* and the crowd surges up to hear the result. His bamboo is then opened and the winner declared.\n\nThe Perak Malays believe this to be an infallible test of the truth of a cause. The boy who holds the false declaration is half-drowned they say, as soon as his head is under water, whereas the champion of the truth is able to remain below until the bystanders drag the post out of the river, with the boy still clinging to it. Such is the power of the truth backed by the sacred names and persons invoked!\n\nThe loser is often fined in addition to suffering the loss of his stakes (one half of which goes to the Raja). He also has to pay the customary fees, namely, $6.25 for the use of the *balei*, $12.50 to the *krani* and $5 to each of the boys.\n\nThis ordeal is not peculiar to Perak. I find a short description of a similar custom in Pegu in Hamilton's \"New Accounts of the East Indies\" (1727). In Pegu, he says, the ordeal by water is managed \"by driving a stake of wood into a river and making the accuser and accused take hold of the stake and keep their heads and bodies under water, and he who stays longest under water is the person to be credited,\"\nMang-mang means accusation. This word must not be confounded with mong-mong, (a brass gong, larger than the kind called chanang, which is beaten when a Royal proclamation is published. See Sijara Malayu p. 83.\n\n254. Telinga rabit di pasang subang.\nKaki untut di pakei-kan gelang.\n\n\"In the torn ear an earring is fastened\nOn the swollen leg a bangle is clasped.\"\n\nSaid of any arrangement in which a want of fitness or suitability is apparent. \"A beggar on horseback.\" Compare No. 215.\n\nUntut elephantiasis.\n\n255. Jika ada padi berhampalih.\nJika ada hati berasalah.\n\n\"In all padi there is chaff, but\nIn every heart there should be feeling.\"\n\nDo not employ a person who is so insensible to right feeling as to pay no attention to rebuke or remonstrance. Get rid of him as you would of the chaff in your corn. \"Le sage entend \u00e0 demi mot.\"\n\n256. Jika tiada tersapu arang di muka, deri hidop baik-lah mati.\n\n\"If the black stain on the face cannot be wiped out death itself is preferable to life.\"\n\nIf revenge for an injury is impossible, life with dishonour is not worth having. (See No. 3.)\n\n257. Jika benih yang baik jatoh ka laut menjadi pulau.\n\n\"Provided that the seed be good, if it drop into the sea it will form an island.\"\n\nAs many of their proverbs shew, the Malays are intensely aristocratic in their principles and have the firmest faith in good blood and highbreeding. The phrase here quoted conveys the popular belief that a man of good family will flourish wherever he settle, and will draw others after him.\n258. *Jangan ditentang matahari chondong*\n*Takut mengikut jalan ta' berantas.*\n\n\"Look not on the setting sun for fear that you may be led on untrodden paths.\"\n\nSunset is the time for spells and incantations; on lovers this period of the day is supposed to have a particularly powerful effect. To them therefore this advice is addressed. Under the influence of unseen spells at this hour they may be induced to throw off all caution, and leave their homes to face unknown dangers and difficulties.\n\n*Rantas, berantas,* To clear a path through jungle by cutting down the underwood.\n\n259. *Jalan mati lagi dichuba,*\n*Inikan pula jalan binasa.*\n\n\"Men venture even on the path of death,\n\"This, at the worst, is but that of ruin.\"\n\nTrade and commerce do not involve such risks as some other undertakings. Where men can be found to risk their lives in other pursuits, the chance of ruin should be faced with equanimity!\n\n260. *Jangan bagei orang berjudi*\n*Alah handak membala, menang handak lagi.*\n\n\"Don't be like the gambler, who if he loses wants his revenge, and if he wins longs for more.\"\n\nDo not start in any evil course in which you will find it difficult to stop yourself. Reformation is difficult. \"*Il n'y a que le premier pas qui co\u00fbte.*\"\n\n261. *Jikalau dudok di atas chian amas lamunkan hati tiada senang.*\n\n\"What if one sits on a gold cushion, if it be with an unquiet mind?\"\n\nPoverty and independence are better than wealth, if it is attended with unhappiness.\n262.

It led to tragic consequences and has now passed into a proverb in the country. The chief in question was a former Shahbandar, to whom one Panglima Prang Smahon complained of an alleged insult to his family. The Shahbandar answered in the preceding lines. A few days later the Panglima Prang, with three companions, watched for him on the river bank and killed him as he was returning to his house after ablution before the maghrib prayers.\n\n283. Kalau getah melilih kalau daun melayang.\n\u201cGutta trickles down, but a leaf is wafted away.\u201d\n\nThe substantial remains, but the worthless disappears. One man leaves behind him solid proof of his character, while another vanishes like a withered leaf and is missed by no one.\n\n284. Kesat daun pimpin, kalau kesat daun labu bulih di chelor.\n\u201cThe pimpin leaf is rough to the touch; so is the pumpkin leaf, but the latter may be boiled (for food).\u201d\n\nThere is all the difference in the world in the view we take of strangers and that in which we regard our own relations. The former, however well we may come to know them, can never be like our own blood, while with the latter, even though estrangement take place reconciliation is always possible. Daun pimpin, is described as a hard, rough leaf which no immersion in boiling water will render less rough and hard.\n\nChelor. To immerse in boiling water; to cook by boiling when the thing to be cooked is plunged in water already at the boil; unlike rebus which is to boil something put into the water when cold.\n\nThe Malays are great observers of ties of relationship. Family connections however distant are recognised. The difference to a man between his relations and persons not connected with him by blood or marriage is, they say, as the difference between flesh and fish; \u201csa\u2019busoh-busoh daging basoh gincha bulih makan, kalau busoh ikan buang sakali;\u201d meat may be eatable though a little high, but fish if at all spoilt must be thrown away at once.\n285. *Inlus benang lulus kelindan.*\n\"If cotton will go through, so will thread.\"\n\nA person must submit to that to which another person of the same class submits. \"Do as others do,\" a phrase to stimulate an undecided person. Hence no doubt the secondary meaning given in Klinkert's dictionary. Favre, who takes the word from him, makes probably a mistake in printing *kelindan*, \"a stiff thread,\" as a distinct word from *kelindan*, \"undecided.\"\n\n286. *Laki pulang kalaparan*\n*Dagang lalu ditanahkan*\n*Anak di riba diletak-kan*\n*Kra di hutan disusu.*\n\n\"The husband goes hungry,\n\"But she can cook for the stranger;\n\"The child on her lap is set down\n\"While the monkey from the jungle is taken to her breast.\"\n\nA proverbial illustration of the kind of circumstantial evidence on which a man may kill his wife for suspected infidelity. The first two lines are taken from a passage in the *undang-undang* (laws) of Perak (\"laki ber jalan ta'makan, dagang lalu di tanah kan\"); the last two have been added later probably.\n\n287. *Memakei dunia ber ganti-ganti,*\n*Yang hidop sesarkan mati,*\n*Dengan mati itu ter nanti-nanti.*\n\n\"We occupy the world, one succeeding another,\nThe living thrust aside the dead,\nWaiting themselves for death in their turn.\"\n\n*Hodie miki cras tibi.*\n*Stat sua cuique dies; breve et irreparabile tempus*\n*Omnibus est vitae.* Virgil.\n\n288. *Mahal, Imam, murahlah Khatib*\n*Mahal demam muda sakit.*\n\n\"Too dear, O Imam, the Khatib's cheaper;\nFever's expensive, it's so easy to be ill,\"\n\"Mahal-lah Imam,\" too dear, O Imam, or, \"it won' top, my good Sir,\" has grown into a slang phrase in Perak to signify a refusal. The origin of the phrase is as follows: Raja Che Sulong of Tipus in Perak, an ancestor of the last Raja Bandahara, lost his only son, Raja Allang Ali, who fell ill and died suddenly. The usual train of pious men who haunt the funerals of the great attended on the occasion to perform the necessary ceremonies and to receive the customary dues. The father, inconsolable for the loss of his only son, met them with the exclamation, \"Hidopkan anak teman dihulu, jika hidop berhabis teman jika tidak mahal-hal Imam. Raise my son to life first; if you can do that, take all I have; if not, you are too dear, O Imam.\"\n\n289. Hilang adat tegah dipakat.\n\n\"Law disappears before a strong combination.\"\n\nJustice suffers when there is a party strong enough to set the laws at defiance. The power which a Chinese secret Society exercises would be aptly characterised by a Malay by a use of this proverb.\n\n290. Handak di telan termangkalan, handak di ludah tiada kaluar.\n\n\"Would you swallow it, it sticks in the throat; would you disgorge it, it will not come forth.\" See No. 125.\n\n291. Hitam, hitam gajah; puteh puteh udang kepal.\n\n\"Black, the blackness of an elephant; white, the whiteness of a handful of shrimps.\"\n\nThere are many shades of colour among Malays though they all seem brown from a western point of view. A fair complexion is more admired than a dark one. The proverb defends the dark skin and ridicules a fair one.\n\n292. Orang bahru kaya jangan di utang\n\nOrang lepas nikah jangan di tandang.\n\n\"Don't borrow from a self-made man\nDon't visit a newly married couple.\"\n\nThe Asiatic nouveau riche, who is unaccustomed to the possession of much money, is an extortionate creditor. There is a good deal of worldly wisdom in the advice to avoid both newly made fortunes and newly married couples, borrowers to the one and visitors to the other being equally unwelcome.\n293. *Yang tegah di sokong, yang rebah ditindeh.*\n\n\u201cWhat is firm is propped up; what has fallen is pressed down.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery one bastes the fat hog, while the lean one burneth. Money begets money.\u201d\n\n294. *Yang di sangka tidak menjadi*\n\n*Yang diam bulih ka dia.*\n\n\u201cWhat was expected has not come to pass\n\nBut the prize falls to him who stirred not.\u201d\n\nThe object for which one man strives unsuccessfully may drop into the lap of another who has done nothing to attain it.\n\n295. *Bergalah hilir tertawa buaya*\n\n*Bersuloh bulan trang tertawa harimau.*\n\n\u201cTo pole down-stream makes the Alligators laugh;\n\nTo carry a light when the moon shines makes the Tigers laugh.\u201d\n\nThe Malays paddle a boat down stream and pole it up stream. To pole down stream or to carry a lamp on a moonlight night is the height of absurdity.\n\n296. *Alang-alang menyelok perkasam bir sampei ka-pangkal lengan.*\n\n\u201cWhen you are dipping your hand into the fish tub you may as well thrust the arm in up to the elbow.\u201d Do a thing thoroughly when you are about it. \u201cYou may as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb.\u201d\n\n*Perkasam*, an evil-smelling preparation of fish preserved in a jar. The fish are put in raw with plenty of salt. The mouth of the jar is then sealed with clay and the mixture is allowed to ripen or ferment for several days, after which the fish may be cooked and eaten. Meat is sometimes treated in the same way.\n297. Terdorong kiki badan merasa, terdorong lidah mas pada nia.\n\n\"If the foot slips the body feels it; for a slip of the tongue gold must compensate.\"\n\nOne of the aphorisms of Malay judges.\n\n298. Rajah adil rajah di sembah,\nRajah ta'adil rajah di sangkak.\n\n\"A just rajah is one to be honoured,\nAn unjust one is one to be resisted.\"\n\n299. Kuat burong kerma sayap,\nKuat ketam kerma sepit.\n\n\"The bird's strength lies in its wings, that of the crap in its claws.\"\n\nThe strength of a Raja lies in his ministers.\n\n300. Kuat gajah terdorong chepat,\nHarimau melompat-lompat.\n\n\"The strong elephant stumbles and the swift tiger has to spring.\"\n\nIf the elephant and tiger sometimes blunder, how much more should faults be excusable in man.\n\n301. Mati rusa kerma jijak mati, kwang kerma bunyi.\n\n\"The deer's death is brought about by its tracks; the argus-pheasant's by its note.\"\n\nSo the guilty man is discovered and punished by means of evidence.\n\nThere are a few points on which I should like to offer some words of explanation before concluding this paper. It is believed that no phrase has been included in the foregoing collection which is not current in a more or less proverbial form among Malays. Many of them, I am aware, hardly answer the description of an old collector of English proverbs who required that the ingredients of a proverb should be sense, shortness and salt. The second element seems often to be\nwanting. But then it must be remembered that some of these Malay phrases are capable of being divided into two or three or more, only one of which is perhaps quoted at one time. No. 174 is one of these, No. 227 is another. It will be observed that many of these Malay sayings are in couplets; one line of which may sometimes be quoted independently of the other, without impairing the sense. In others the point of the couplets lies in the antithesis, and both lines are essential to the meaning.\n\nArrangement is of course a difficulty in a collection of this sort. An analysis of proverbs and maxims grouped under appropriate headings was not to be attempted. Alphabetical order has been followed where possible.\n\nAs to the proverbs themselves I think I may fairly claim for the Malays that their sayings, besides being pointed and idiomatic, sometimes embody thoughts and ideas well worthy of Western races. Pride and honour are impressed in such maxims as Bir puteh tulang jangan puteh mata, \u201cLet the bones whiten but not the eyes\u201d (No. 230), and Mahu kah orang menghujankan govramnia (No. 170) \u201cWill a man put his salt out in the rain,\u201d (i.e. expose his family secret to public ridicule). \u201cDo not worship the rich or contemn the poor\u201d (No. 210) is a maxim worthy of the free and independent spirit of the Malay, and I know no Oriental race who carry it out better in practice. Sneers at the assumption of the nouveau riche, and instances of a truly conservative belief in good blood and good breeding are plentiful. The successful adventurer is the \u201cblind man who has just found his sight\u201d (No. 20). Kachang lupakan kulit, \u201cThe bean forgets its pod,\u201d (No. 126) conveys a similar sarcasm aimed at the meanness which would attempt to conceal a humble origin. So \u201cA broom bound with silk thread\u201d (No. 100) is the most indulgent comparison which a Malay can find for a person dressed above his rank.\n\nThe sound practical sense of English proverbs, such as that which teaches that \u201ca stitch in time saves nine,\u201d or that other which recommends \u201chonesty\u201d on the score of its being \u201cthe best policy,\u201d is not conspicuous among the Malays, but, on the other hand, we find treachery and bad faith, characteristics with which Malays have been credited for generations, often condemned by themselves (See Nos. 137, 143). That they are not wanting in diplomatic cunning is perhaps shewn by proverbs like (No. 165) Muka berpan-\ndang budi kadapatan, which is quite untranslateable without a long paraphrase. \"Know all about your man before you face him\" (for you won't find out his real motives at the interview,) is what is intended to be expressed. Suspicion and distrust are inbred in Malays and with only too good reason; plausibility and hypocrisy come in, therefore, for some stinging comparisons (Nos. 76, and 188,) and it is amusing to find an injunction to beware even of friendly offers conveyed in the phrase Menulong kerbau ditangkap harimau (No. 187). \"Such assistance as the buffalo gets when he is rescued from the tiger.\"\n\nIngratitude must be common, or we should not find a cynical warning not to help those in distress. To do so and to meet with the customary return is \"to help a dog out of a hedge,\" (Melepaskan anjing tersapit, No. 172) see also No. 251. Among a Mohamedan people we might expect to find that proverbs on the subject of women are governed by theories common to the whole Mohamedan world. This however is not the case. Malay women are not concealed from public view, and enjoy more freedom than falls to the lot of women in most Mohamedan countries. Polygamy is a foreign institution which has never taken root kindly in Malay soil, and though it is lawful for a man to have a plurality of wives, only a small minority avail themselves of the privilege. It is uncommon to find a Malay husband who can induce his wives if he has more than one, to live under one roof. To do so is, according to a common expression, like \"keeping two tigers in one cage,\" (Harimau dua sa'kandang.) Contemporary wives must be provided with separate establishments, they generally hate each other and sometimes come to blows if they meet. The first wife looks upon her successor as an unwarrantable intruder who has stolen away her husband's affections and ruined the peace of her home. So well is this feeling known, that it is common for the relations of a girl who is asked in marriage by a man already provided with a wife, to insist that the first wife shall be divorced before the new match is agreed to. Hence the common saying\u2014\n\nSayangkan kain buangkan baju,\nSayangkan lain buangkan aku.\n\n\"If you love your sarong drop your jacket,\nIf you love the other cast me aside.\" (No. 103).\nThe unhappy man who owns two or more households and has to listen in each to the upbraidings and reproaches of the rival ladies must have, say the Malays, \"a heart of stone and the ears of a jar,\" *berhatikan batu bertelingakan tempayan*.\n\nA woman who is one of several wives of one husband is said\n\n*Minum chuka pagi hari.* (No. 183).\n\n\"To drink vinegar in the morning,\" an allusion probably to the bad temper in which she goes to the day's duties.\n\nThe phenomenon of a hen-pecked husband, which a Mohamedan country might hardly be thought to afford, is hit off in a very neat and concise proverb, *Kamudi deri haluwan*, \"Steered from the bow\" (No.141). It is by no means rare to find Malay wives possessed of quite sufficient energy and spirit to take command in the house.\n\nMarriage does not exhaust all the proverbs on the subject of women. Feminine nature in the abstract is attacked in an uncomplimentary one, *Kerbau sa'kawan lalu di kandang manusia sa'orang tiadu terkawal*, \"A herd of buffaloes may be guarded, but not so one human being!\" (No. 148).\n\nBut this is nothing compared with a damnatory sentence in the Menangkabau Code which figuratively describes a woman as *ibu Iblis saudari segala Sheitan* \"the mother of Satan and the sister of all the devils.\"\n\nOf historical proverbs, which commemorate real events and incidents, a few specimens are given in the preceding collection. Two, which relate to the Dutch, ought not to have escaped the attention of Mr. Klinkert, who, as far as I know, was the first paremiographer who occupied himself with Malay proverbs\u2014*Pelabor habis Palembang ta'ulah*, \"The supplies were all finished but Palembang did not fall.\" It is a punning allusion to an unsuccessful siege (see No. 116) in former days, and still tells with all its original force when some expensive project, barren of result, is under discussion. What the Hollanders did in Perak to merit being handed down to posterity in a proverb directed against those who, like Oliver Twist, ask for \"more\" has not been preserved in local tradition. But *Aika-lagi-lagi seperti blanda minta tanah*, \"Everlastingly more, more, like Dutchmen asking for land\" (No. 205), is a phrase with which Perak women will long\ncontinue to rebuke greediness and importunity in their offspring. The French have or had a sarcasm of the same kind directed against our nation, Anglais and creditor having been once upon a time synonymous terms:\u2014l\u2019ai pay\u00e9 tous mes Anglais would thus mean \u201cI have settled with my creditors!\u201d\n\nThis brings me to another class of proverbs, those which are pointed at the natives of other states or countries and which fasten on some failing or shortcoming and hold it up to ridicule. The countries ridiculed, no doubt, have proverbs which repay with interest those aimed against them. The Perak Malay who prides himself on skill in the use of weapons sneers at Kedah men as hayam pupuh sabong ta\u2019 bertaji, \u201cMock gamecocks that fight without spurs.\u201d A more effectual way of exciting the wrath of a Javanese cannot be devised than to apply to him a Malay phrase which insinuates a national want of cleanliness; orang Jawa baberek makan toma \u201ca Javanese; a wood-pecker that eats insects!\u201d\n\nNatives of Korinchi in Sumatra are supposed to have the power of turning themselves into tigers and are believed to range the forests in that form. The idea has probably arisen from their fearlessness in travelling alone or in very small parties in the most inaccessible districts. \u201cThere go the tigers to feed upon buffalo flesh\u201d is a shout which the sight of some harmless Korinchi traders entering an eating-house is almost certain to provoke.\n\nThe people of Menangkabau are proverbially dull-witted and the Perak Malays have the following proverb about them, Menangkabau bingong kalau ada ikan di gosok \u2018kalau ada kail lauk,\u2019 \u201cThe Menangkabau is such a fool that if a fish is within his reach he only says if I had a hook this would be dinner.\u201d It would never occur to him, say his detractors, to devise any impromptu means of catching the fish!\n\nThe Malays of Perak were denounced by Hamilton a hundred and fifty years ago as \u201ctreacherous, faithless and bloody.\u201d His description is partly borne out by one or two proverbs about them which will be found printed in the foregoing collection (Nos. 137 and 203.)\n\nSome proverbs are purely local and do not travel beyond the state or district to which they apply. Of this class are\n\n* D\u2019Israeli-Curiosities of Literature, \u201cThe Philosophy of Proverbs.\u201d\na series of sayings which extol the productions or good things of particular places, on the principle which dictated the line.\n\n\"Potatoes grow in Limerick and beef in Ballimore.\"\n\nIn Perak they say \"Gulei lawang yang paku, ayer Balang Padang, sirih sirih chekus, bras bras Sungkei, jika orang Batu Bara ta'balik ka Batu Bara,\" \"A curry of fern-shoots, the water of Batang Padang, the betel-leaf of Chekus and the rice of Sungkei; if the Batu Bara man has once tasted these he will never see his country again.\" Batu Bara is in Sumatra and all the other places named are in Perak. A similar epitome of the good things to be had in Kampar (Perak) is current among the natives of that district. Ikan nia lampam Barang, rambai Pedatang, langsat langsat Penarik, sepam sepam Gugup, tempuyak Majur.\n\nSo, in the palmy days of native rule in Larut, before the Chinese had defied Malay authority, when the Malay Chief, the Orang Kaya Mantri, exercised almost regal powers and the most profuse hospitality tempted men from other parts of Perak to Bukit Gantang, it used to be said, Termakankan nasi kerinsing, terminumkan ayer tempayang puteh, terlangkah kan merbau bersila ta'balik lagi, \"He who has eaten the rice of the copper pot, who has drunk the water of the white jar and who has passed the merbau bersila (a particular tree) will never return.\"\n\nThe \"white jar\" still stands outside the Mantri's house, the tree alluded to is a landmark in the Bukit berapit Pass, through which the road from Larut to Kwala Kangsar now runs, but it is to be feared that their virtues have departed. The well-fed guest who invented this flattering sentiment did not foresee the time when Amphitryon would be an exile and the former scenes of festivity silent and nearly deserted.\n\nThe following is of more general application and therefore much more widely known. Handak mati di Malaka, handak memakei di Palembang, handak tidor di Batu Bara, \"The place to die is in Malacca, to clothe one's self Palembang, to sleep Batu Bara.\" In Malacca great trouble and expense are taken at funerals, and graves are generally tended with much care and reverence. Palembang is famous for its silk-weaving. The people of Batu Bara are said to under-\nstand better than any other Malays how to make a comfortable bed. \u201cThey pile up mats and mattresses until it hurts you to tumble off them\u201d is the description given to me.\n\nOne more proverb of this class, a local saying in Perak where all the villages named are situated,\u2014\n\n*Kalau jadi gajah jangan jadi gajah orang Padang Asam, kalau jadi kurbau jangan jadi kurbau orang Sayong, kalau jadi rayat jangan jadi rayat Pulo Tiga.* \u201cShould you be an elephant don\u2019t belong to the people of Padang Asam, should you be a buffalo don\u2019t belong to Sayong, should you be a peasant don\u2019t belong to Pulo Tiga.\u201d The allusions are, as may be guessed, the reverse of complimentary. Padang Asam is on the main-road between Ulu Perak and the sea, and in former times before a cart-road was made it was one of the stages at which elephants, the only means of transport, stopped. The people of Padang Asam must in those days have gained an unenviable reputation for overloading their elephants. Sayong boasts of extensive paddy fields, which give plenty of occupation for buffaloes, and they are perhaps better cultivated than similar lands in other parts of Perak. I don\u2019t know what particular tyrant gave rise, by local oppression, to the notion that to be a ryot of Pulo Tiga was an undesirable lot.\n\nWithout knowing anything about Malays, it would be easy, after reading their proverbs, to pronounce them to be a people given to a country life. Agriculture, hunting, fishing, boating and wood-craft are the occupations or accomplishments which furnish most of the illustrations, and the number of beasts, birds, fishes and plants named in a collection of Malay proverbs will be found to be considerable. Proverbs of this kind are of course of home manufacture. A few, however, which may be met with in books are of foreign origin and may be traced to Hindustani, Persian or Arabic. The proverb *Juhari juga yang mengenal manikam,* \u201cIt is the jeweller who can tell a precious stone\u201d (Hikayat Abdullah p. 3), is a somewhat clumsy adaptation of the Hindustani *Juhari juhar pachane.* Another very common proverb (nearly equivalent in meaning to the phrase \u201cBlood is thicker than water.\u201d) *Ta\u2019kan ayer di parang putus,* \u201cWater is not to be cut with a knife,\u201d is almost exactly identical with the Hindustani proverb *Lathi-se pani juda nahin nota* \u201cWater is not to be divided by a stick;\u201d\nBoth Malay and Hindustani furnish equivalents for a well-known French proverb, *Dans le royaume des aveugles les borgnes sont rois*. The Malays say *Dit\u00fampat tiada lang hata bilalang aku-lah lang*, \u201cWhere there are no kites the grasshopper says I am a kite.\u201d The Hindustani version is shorter and neater, *Jahan darakht nahin wahan rand bhi darakht*, \u201cWhere there are no trees even the castor-oil plant is a tree.\u201d\n\nMalays who quote the saying, *Barang siapa menggali lobang iya juga terprosok kadalamnia* \u201cWhosoever digs a pit, he shall fall into it himself\u201d (Hikayat Abdullah, p. 165), are innocent no doubt of any intention to borrow from Solomon or from the Arabs. Yet there can be no doubt of course of the Semitic origin of the phrase and the Malay version must be simply a translation. Is it a translation of Proverbs XXVI, 27, \u201cWhoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein,\u201d or has it reached the Malays from Mohamedan sources? The latter supposition seems the more likely; and yet the first is not impossible, for it is well-known that *Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir*, from whose Autobiography I take the Malay passage, assisted some English missionaries in translating the Bible into Malay. Those interested in Mohamedan legends will find a story connected with the phrase thus related by Burton (Pilgrimage to El-Medinah and Meccah, II, 265):\u2014\u201cAt about half a mile from the city \u201c(Meccah) we passed on the left a huge heap of stones, \u201cwhere my companions stood and cursed. This grim-looking \u201ccairn is popularly believed to note the place of the well \u201cwhere Abu Lahab laid an ambuscade for the Prophet. \u201cThis wicked uncle stationed there a slave, with orders to \u201cthrow headlong into the pit the first person who approach- \u201ced him, and privily persuaded his nephew to visit the \u201cspot at night: after a time, anxiously hoping to hear that \u201cthe deed had been done, Abu Lahab incautiously drew \u201cnigh, and was precipitated by his own bravo into the place \u201cof destruction. Hence the well-known saying in Islam, \u201cWhoso \u201cdiggeth a well for his brother shall fall into it himself.\u201d\n\nSometimes Malay ideas may perhaps be traced to Buddhist and not to Mohamedan sources. In the *Prataya Sataka* a collection of moral sentences in Singhalese the following passage occurs:\n\n\u201cThough a man were to make an immense heap of sugar \u201cand plant in the midst of it a seed of the *Kosamba* tree and\nwere to pour upon it a thousand pots of milk, yet it will never bear sweet fruit.\" *\n\nThe Malays say (see No. 7 ante, Vol. 1 p. 89) \"Though you plant the pria on a bed of sago and manure it with honey and water it with treacle and train it over sugar-canies, when it is cooked it will still be bitter.\"\n\nA similar proverb in Hindustani is Nim na mitha no sech gar ghi se, \"The nim tree will not become sweet though watered with syrup and clarified butter.\"\n\nOne more instance of a Hindustani proverb exactly reproduced in Malay will be sufficient; Jitni chadar utna pan phailana, \"Stretch your legs according to the length of your blanket\" corresponds very nearly with the Malay, Brapa panjang lanjur bagitulah selimut i.e. \"Suit your blanket to the length of your legs.\" Both are equivalent to the English proverb \"Cut your coat according to your cloth.\" But it must not be thought from these specimens that the Malays are indebted to other nations for many of their proverbs. The contrary in fact is the case; originality of thought, no less than happiness of expression, usually characterises them.\n\nNo excuse is needed, I trust, for my having endeavoured at such considerable length to familiarise English students with the peculiar turns of Malay thought. The collection now printed may be very materially added to by a reference to Klinkert's work and to Favre's dictionary. The specimens there given have not yet been published in English, and a translation of them has not come within the scope of the present paper. Should, however, the subject be found interesting by those in the Straits Settlements who aim at a thorough intimacy with the Malay language, there is little doubt that the Dutch and French collections will find a translator at some later date.\n\nAs an encouragement to those who may feel disposed to supplement existing collections let me quote a passage from a writer already cited who has devoted a paper to \"these neglected fragments of wisdom which exist among all nations:\u2014\n\n\"The interest we may derive from the study of proverbs is\n\n* Recollections of Ceylon\u2014Selkirk, 148.\nnot confined to their universal truths, nor to their poignant pleasantry; a philosophical mind will discover in proverbs a great variety of the most curious knowledge. The manners of a people are painted after life in their domestic proverbs; and it would not be advancing too much to assert that the genius of the age might be often detected in its prevalent ones. The learned Selden tells us that the proverbs of several nations were much studied by Bishop Andrews; the reason assigned was, because \"by them he knew the minds of several nations, which,\" said he, \"is a brave thing, as we count him wise who knows the minds and the insides of men, which is done by knowing what is habitual to them.\" Lord Bacon condensed a wide circuit of philosophical thought when he observed that \"the genius, wit, and spirit of a nation are discovered by their proverbs.\"\nNOTES ON GUTTA PERCHA\nAND CAOUTCHOUC-YIELDING TREES\nBY MR. F. W. BURBIDGE.\n\nCOMMUNICATED WITH REMARKS BY MR. W. H. TREACHER,\nCOLONIAL SECRETARY OF LABUAN.\n\n(Read at a meeting of the Society held on the 9th June, 1879.)\n\nNotwithstanding the light which has been lately thrown on the subject of Gutta and Rubber-producing trees by the labours of professed botanists and others in the Straits Settlements, I venture to think that this most important subject, which has long been wrapped in such extreme confusion* may still be advantageously discussed, and nowhere with more advantage than in the pages of this Journal. Its importance may be gathered from the following extract from Sir J. D. Hooker\u2019s \u201cReport of Kew Gardens,\u201d 1877:\n\n\u201cGutta-Percha.\u2014Literally nothing is known as to the botanical history of the commercial varieties of Gutta-Percha. Several kinds of different qualities and even exhibiting different properties are imported into England and are in immense request, especially in telegraph cable manufactories, but neither the plants which produce them nor the localities in which they are produced are approximately known. I attach great importance to the prompt investigation of Gutta-Percha-yielding plants. There is reason to believe that they are very local and restricted in their geographical occurrence. The collection of products of this kind for commercial purposes is shown by experience to lead inevitably to the destruction of the trees producing them, since these are recklessly destroyed and never replaced. It is not merely, therefore, a matter of scientific interest to\n\n* Extract from a letter from Professor W. T. Thiselton Dyer\u20149th August, 1878.\nascertain the exact nature of Gutta-Percha-yielding trees, but it is the first step in securing the perpetuation of the supply. The botanical investigation of a product or plant simply means getting such complete knowledge about it as to leave no difficulty in the way of recognising it at any time without uncertainty.\"\n\nMr. F. W. Burbidge, who has been recently travelling in the interests of botany in North-West Borneo, has paid considerable attention to this matter, and has been good enough to furnish me with his valuable notes thereon, which I shall proceed to communicate in his own words. I should first, however, remark that Mr. Burbidge had sent specimens of some of the Caoutchouc-yielding climbers to the Royal Gardens, Kew, and from their examination Professor Dyer has been enabled to come to the conclusion \"that Mr. Col-\"lins and others are quite wrong in identifying the Bor-\"nean Rubber plants with Urceola Elastica,\" and that \"Gutta Scrapit is undoubtedly the produce of a Willugh-\"beia.\"\n\n1.\n\n_Gutta-Percha_ or _Gniato_-yielding trees. \"Gutta Merah\" or \"Gniato Merah\" (Kadayan) \"Gniato Merah,\" \"Parah Masiah\" (Musut). These are the native names on the Luwas river for a large forest tree often 100-150 feet in height and varying in diameter from 1 to 3 feet. A large trunk is said to yield as much as a pieul of prepared product, the raw sap or milk being obtained by incising or \"ringing\" the bark of the felled boles at distances of two to three feet. The sap is prepared by boiling and stirring. The leaves of this tree are 49 to 50 inches long, by about 2 to 3 inches broad, glossy green above, but their under-surface is covered by _rufus tomentum_. It has been named _Isonandra Gutta_ by Sir W. Hooker and from the numbers of felled trunks met with in North West Borneo would seem to be the main source of \"Gutta-Percha\" proper. In Perak this is known as _Gutta Taban_.\n\n(N. B. The Malayan name \"Gniato\" is used for hard or inelastic gutta, in contradistinction to \"Lechak,\" which signifies elastic rubber, or Caoutchouc.)\n\nB.* _Gutta Putih_ \"Gniato Puti\" (Kadayan) Para Buda (Murut). A smaller tree than the last, having trunks 6 to 12\n\n* Isonandra Macrophylla (?).\ninches diameter, and rarely exceeding 50 to 60 feet in height. Said to yield 1 to 5 catties of prepared gutta, which being lighter in colour than the last is called white (putih) in contradistinction to red (merah).\n\n*Gutta Merah* (Kadayan) *Para Bukrui* or *Para Bokuri* (Murut). A forest tree having trunks 12 to 18 inches diameter, and 50 to 60 feet in height. Foliage small, oblong. This yields 3 to 5 catties of gutta, which is whitish in colour and subelastic.\n\n*Gutta* or *Gniato Elong* (Kadayan) *Para Larall* (Murut). Forest tree having trunks 12 to 24 inches diameter, and yielding 6 to 10 catties of gutta, according to size.\n\n*Gutta* or *Gniato Bulu* (Kadayan) *Para Bulu* (Murut.) A forest tree the trunk of which sometimes attains a diameter of 3 to 4 feet and yields 20 to 30 catties of gutta. Leaves 3 to 4 inches long, $1\\frac{1}{2}$ to 2 inches broad, glossy green above, and ferruginous underneath. My own opinion is that these last four trees are all different species of *Isonandra*. They are, however, so distinct that the gutta hunters easily recognise them, although at the time the produce of all is collected indiscriminately and, after being mixed, is sold under the common name of *Gutta* or *Gniato Merah*. Murton says that the colour of this product \"varies according to the quantity of bark and other impurities mixed with it;\" but the various proportions in which the produce of the different kinds of \"Gniato\"-yielding trees are mixed, has I believe, much to do with the colour and quality of the produce.\n\n2.\n\n**Rubber or Caouthouc-yielding Climbers.** Elastic rubber, Caoutchouc or *Gutta Lechak*, is obtained from three kinds (species or varieties) of rough-stemmed, woody climbers, found in the lofty forests beside most of the rivers in North, North-East, and South-West Borneo, at altitudes varying from very near the sea level, up to 3,000 feet.\n\nThe stems vary in length from 50 to 150 feet, and in thickness from 2 to 8 inches, and by the collectors the different kinds are at once known by the colour and corrugations of the stem or bark. The leaves are 2 to 5 inches long, oblong, lanceolate, and glossy above, and are set opposite on the thin brown thick-noded branchlets, having\npetioles \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) to 1 inch in length; flowers unknown. *Gutta Serapit Menangan* is said to have white flowers, and the round-fruited *Serapit* yellow ones. All three kinds bear edible fruits of a clear orange yellow, and these are readily distinguished by marked variations in size and form. These fruits consist of an outer skin or rind as thick as that of an ordinary orange, but very tender and brittle when ripe, milky sap or gutta exuding in drops from the fractured surfaces; this when tasted being intensely bitter. Inside the rind are sections of apricot-coloured pulp, crushed closely together, but easily separable, each of which contains a single soft leathery-coated seed, the size of that of a scarlet runner bean.\n\nFull grown fruits attain a diameter of 2 to 4 inches.\n\n* Fig. 1. *Gutta Serapit Menangan*. Fruit clear orange yellow, 3 to 4 inches in diameter, distinctly pear-shaped and edible.\n\n* Fig. 1 is a reduced representation of the kind known to the Kadayans on the Lawas river as *Gutta Serapit Manungan* or *Gutta Manungan Serapit*, and is known by its corrugated stem having well marked nodes 15 to 18 inches apart, and by its pear-shaped fruits. By the Muruts it is called *Boi Belebit*. On the Limbang river the fruit is called *Jintawan*, and in Perak *Senggerip* or *Gutta Senggerip*. (See Murton's Report).\n\n* Fig. 2. *Gutta Serapit*. Fruit averaging 3 inches diameter, orange-yellow, orange-shaped and edible.\n\n* Fig. 2 is a reduced sketch of a round-fruited species or variety, having stems and leaves very similar to the last and yielding apparently the same milky exudation, but it is said to produce but little gutta, and is seldom collected. The Kadayans call it *Serapit* and the Muruts *Boi Kalang*.\n\nA third kind, known as *Menungan Manga* (Kadayan) *Katawah* (Murut) has much thicker stems than the two last, covered with light cork coloured bark, but slightly corrugated, and the fruit is round like the last, but rarely exceeding 2 inches in diameter. The light cory bark and small fruits distinguish it from the others, and unlike\n\n* Bark of a reddish colour.\n* It has not been found practicable to re-produce these illustrations.\nthe last named round form, or Serapit, this kind yields very good gutta. The milk of the first and third mentioned is collected indiscriminately, and the produce is known as Gutta Menungan or Gutta Susu, the last name, however, being applied to the hard product of an entirely different tree in Perak (See Murton's Report).\n\nThis Caoutchouc or rubber is prepared by the addition of Nipah salt to the milk, and stirring; and is sold in the form of black greasy looking balls about half a catty weight each, these being threaded on a strip of rattan for convenience of transport.\n\nWith reference to Gutta Serapit Menungan, Mr. Collins gives the following at p. 24 of his \"Report on the Caoutchouc of Commerce.\"\u2014Vernacular names, Gutta Susu or Susuh (Mal. Milk Gum). Jintawan, variety a; Jintawan Susu, or Milky Jintawan, variety b.; Jintawan Bulat, or round fruited Jintawan, and c. Ngret or Ngerit Jintawan? Also variety a. Serapit, most common variety; b. Petabo, the best variety; and variety c. \"Menungan,\" the greatest quantity, Getuh Katjai (Sumatra.)?\"\n\nMr. Collins further adds that when this Caoutchouc first appeared in commerce (1864) he succeeded in identifying it as the produce of Urceola Elastica, partly from the accounts of Motley, Low, Roxburgh, etc., and partly from Campbell's notes and specimens in the British Museum. Judging from the small woodcut illustration of Urceola Elastica given at page 1193 of Lindley and Moore's Treasury of Botany, the Bornean plants here referred to by me certainly do not belong to that species, although the description appended is fairly truthful and evidently refers to the Serapit.\n\nMurton, at p. 12 of his contribution to the history of Gutta-producing trees, points out that the flowers of Urceola (one species only being known) are in terminal panicles or cymes, whereas in the Serapits they are axillary.\n\nThe above are Mr. Burbidge's notes on this subject, which he was good enough, while busily engaged in other matters, to put together at my request. I trust I may be pardoned if I add a few remarks of my own from information which I have gathered from veteran Bornean Gutta and Rubber collectors and others, both Kadayans and natives of Brunei.\nForest Trees Producing Gutta-Percha in N.

Mr. Murton (Journal No. 1 p. 107) states that Gutta Jelutong is obtained from a species of Alyxia; a statement opposed to the description given me by the Bornean collectors, from which it would appear to be the product of a lofty tree, taller than any of those yielding the true gutta (i.e., over 100 feet in height.) Growing on both hills and in swampy land, with dark coloured bark, leaves 5\" long 3\" \u2020 broad, green above and light below, seeds in black pods like those of a bean 9 to 10 inches in length, each pod containing 8 to 10 seeds. The timber is white, very light, tough, and much resembles that of the Palye.\n\nThe collectors state that there is no such natural product as Gutta Merah or red Gutta; the colour being due to the admixture of filings from the bark of the tree in the proportion of \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) filings to \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) gutta; as it is said that the Chinese traders, unaware of the adulteration, prefer the red or adulterated to the natural Gutta.\n\nClimbers producing Caoutchouc or India rubber in N.

The fruits of all are edible, and the plants are distinguished chiefly by the different shape of the leaves and fruit, and the corrugations of the bark.\n\nThe fruit of the Manungan Pul, or proper, is pear-shaped. As the Natives say it \"has a neck to it.\" That of the Manungan Bujok is more egg-shaped\u2014\"without the neck,\" and that of the Manungan Manga is round. The leaves of the Bertabus or Petabos are the broadest and largest; then come those of the Serapits, somewhat longer in proportion; and lastly those of the Menungans, which are the smallest, and, in proportion to their breadth, the longest.\n\nGutta and rubber are at present imported into Labuan from the following rivers, viz., Barram, Meri, Bakong, Baleit, Tutong, Limbang, Trusan, Lawas and Kimanis.\nThe mode of collecting gutta in Borneo does not materially differ from that described by Mr. Murton in the first number of this journal. The terms Gutta Singgarip, Gutta Rambong, and Gutta Taban are unknown to my informants.\n\nThe following observations are by Mr. Burbidge:\n\n**New Gutta-yielding Trees.**\n\nApparently all the Gutta or Caoutchouc-yielding trees were discovered and their produce brought into use by the natives of the localities in which they grow, and, the native wants amply supplied, the inclination to look out sources of fresh supply would of course cease; but even since these products are of considerable trade value to the collectors, nothing seems to be done either to replace trees or search out new gutta-yielding plants. Probably there are thousands of tons of these known products still existing in Bornean forests, but as difficulties in collecting increase (by the supply being yearly further removed from the markets, etc.) so will prices rise. The \"Serapits\" may be readily propagated by layering the stems and by seeds; but so long as the forests are uncontrolled by Europeans, it is useless to expect natives to trouble themselves in the perpetuation of these plants, easy though it be; nor is it likely they will hunt out fresh sources of supply. Much of the gutta from Java, India and Australia is the produce of a species of *Ficus*, many species of which milk-yielding trees are common in Bornean forests, and it seems to me very probable that some of these would yield good gutta in remunerative quantities as the result of experiments.\n\nThe Bornean representatives of the Bread fruit family (*Artocarpus*) should also be examined, as good gutta or caoutchouc is yielded by at least one S. American speeies belonging to this order.\"\n\n---\n\n**Postscript to the Above Notes on Gutta, &c.**\n\nThe perusal of Mr. Treacher's very interesting and valuable notes have induced me to add a little information that has reached me since my last communication on this subject was written.\nAs regards Gutta jelutong, Mr. Treacher's description of the Bornean trees entirely coincides with my knowledge of it, and from an examination of imperfectly developed flowers Dr. Beccari arrived at the same conclusion.\n\nThe timber of the jelutong is sometimes used in Singapore for making the Malay trompah or wooden sandals.\n\nMr. Treacher in one place describes the fruit as \"being a black pod like that of a bean;\" but a reference at the foot of the page describes it as \"2\u00bd inches long, pear shaped, 'coming to a sharp point and attached by large end\"\u2014two descriptions which appear to me diametrically opposed.\n\nI have not seen the fruit of the Alyxia, but it thus described by the authors of the \"Genera Plantarum\" \"Drupae v. bacc\u00e6 2 v. abortu solitari\u00e6, ovoide\u00e6 v. oblong\u00e6\u2014sperm\u00e6 v. monilifer\u00e6, articulis 2 rarius 3\u20144 oblongis 1\u2014spermes.\"\n\nI add also the general description of the genus for comparison, from the same source:\n\n\"Frutices saepius glabri. Folia 3-4-natim verticillata v. rarius opposita, coriacea, nitida, pennivenia venis tamen parum prominulis.\" Flores parvuli, gemini v. cymosi, cymis capitellatis fasciculatis v. breviter spicato-paniculatis axillaribus v. in axillis foliorum terminalium pseudo-terminalibus.\n\nA specimen of what appears by Mr. Treacher's description to be a Serapit has been sent from the jungle here to Kew and Professor Oliver has identified it as a Chilocarpus. Professor Dyer considers the Perak \"Gutta Singgarip\" which is evidently one of the Bornean Manungams to be identical with Wallich's Willughbeia martabanica. Later on, referring to some specimens collected in Singapore he writes:\n\n\"The Gutta Singgarip plant that you have met with near the Botanic Garden is an interesting discovery. It is not, I think, the same as the Perak plant, though very close to it,\u2014on the other hand it may be the same as one of Mr. Burbidge's Bornean species.\"\n\nHundreds of young plants of at least five of these rubber-producing climbers are now established in the Botanic gar-\nden, so that we may now confidently look forward to an elucidation of the greater part of the confusion that has hitherto existed in connection with this subject.\n\nAs regards *Ureola* the authors of the \"Genera Plantarum\" give \"Species 4 Peninsul\u00e6 Malayan\u00e6 Archipelagique incolae.\"\n\nReferring to Mr. Burbidge's remarks about the *Artocarpus* I may say that the veteran collector Mr. Thos. Lobb once showed me a specimen of a rubber which he had collected in Borneo some 25 years previously from an Artocarpad, and which was then in a capital state of preservation; whereas the best \"Ceara-scrap rubber\" will not resist the action of the atmosphere nearly so long.\n\nAs regards the species of the genus *Ficus*, the natives of Perak have tried all the indigenous species, but with the exception of *F. elastica*, which produces \"gutta rambong,\" none has been found to yield a marketable gutta and the milk obtained from them is, at best, only fit for bird-lime.\n\nA very important point is the mode of collecting and preparing. The S. American rubbers, which are the best in the London markets, are prepared in a very different manner to the slovenly, indolent mode carried out by Malays, and I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that if the Malayan rubbers were prepared in the same way as the S. American, a larger demand would arise for them, and materially higher prices be easily obtained than at present. As an instance I may state that a sample that I collected in Singapore, which was allowed simply to coagulate without the addition of salt or other foreign substance, was submitted by Professor Dyer to competent judges in London, and they reported that \"The quality is very fair. The 'present marketable value is about 1s. 3d. per lb.; and on applying to Mr. Robt. Campbell he informed me that the price they paid in London was only 1s. for the best brands prepared in the usual way.\n\nH. J. MURTON.\n\n29th July, 1872.\nTHE MARITIME CODE OF THE MALAYS.\n\n[The following Paper comprises a translation by Sir S. Raffles of the more important passages of the Malacca Maritime Codes, interpolated with notes by the Translator. The manner in which this valuable contribution came into the Society's hands is sufficiently explained in a note which appears at the end of the Miscellaneous Notices. The reprint of this Translation, except for a few necessary corrections, appears in the exact form of Sir S. Raffles' original Paper as printed in the Malacca Weekly Register. A few footnotes under the initials above referred to are appended in explanation of certain obscure phrases.]\n\nIn the following Sketch, which defines the Laws and usages of the Malays at Sea, the Malacca Code has been selected for the text, as well on account of the admitted superiority of that once flourishing kingdom among the Malay states in general, as from the circumstance of this Code having, with some slight modifications, been adopted by several of the ancient and powerful states on the Island of Celebes, and still continuing in force among many of the Bugis and Macassar Traders from that Island. The Bugis and Macassar states, which are nations radically distinct from the Malays, possess a Maritime Code of still greater antiquity, but in better times they appear to have, in many instances, adopted the Sea Laws of Malacca, nearly in the same manner as the Romans adopted the celebrated Rhodian code.\n\nThe Malacca code appears to have been compiled during the reign of Sultan Mahmud Shah, the first... Later on, Malacca mentioned in the Malayan annals to have he writes:\u2014the Mahomedan faith. The circumstance is undertaken place about the year of the Hajirah, corresponding with the Christian Era 1296.\u2014The origin of the Malacca discovery. It is therefore, be considered as nearly coeval with, though very establishment of Islamism among the Malays. The name as one the code is thus stated in the preamble,\n\"These are the Laws to be enforced in Ships, Junks, and Prahus.\"\n\n\"First of all! Pati Sturun and Pati Elias assembled Nakhoda Jenal and Nakhoda Dewa and Nakhoda Isahak for the purpose of consulting and advising relative to the usages at Sea, and of compelling in conformity thereto, a code of Undang Undang or Institutes.\"\n\nAfter they had consulted together and collected the Laws, they presented them to Dato' Bendahara Sri Maha-Raja in the kingdom of Malacca, who laid them at the feet of the Illustrious Mahmud Shah\u2014Whereupon that prince said \"I grant the request of the Bendahara and establish the Sea Laws and Institutes for your Government and that of your posterity.\u2014When you administer these Laws at Sea they shall be carried into effect at Sea in like manner as those of the Land are carried into effect on Land, and let them not interfere with each other, for you,\" addressing himself to the Nakhodas, \"are as rajas at Sea, and I confer authority on you accordingly.\"\n\nThe several Nakhodas who had framed the code were then honored with titles, Nakhoda Jenal received the Titles of Sang Utama di Raja, and Nakhoda Isahak that of Sang Setia di Raja?\n\n\"In such manner were the Laws established and made known during the times when the kingdom of Malacca was tranquil and prosperous during the reign of Sultan Mahmud Shah.\"\n\n1 & 2. According to other Copies these Titles are Sangboya di Raja and Dupati Shah, when Sri Nara di Raja was Bendahara and governed that country.\n\nDyer to come, as the Laws of the Sea are established, as well as the quality of the Land, let them be observed in order that about 1s. 3\u00bd undertaken may be properly regulated\u2014let these be informed towards all Countries, in as much as the 1s. for the boat which relate to the Sea only, and the Laws of which relate to the Land only, are defined, because the Sea cannot interfere with those established on shore.\n\nAccording to these Institutes let the Law be administered at Sea that no disputes and quarrels may take place\u2014let them\nbe known and descend to posterity, that men may not act according to their own will and inclination, but that order and regularity may prevail on board vessels, as well during prosperity as adversity\u2014let not what is established be done away, nor these laws be resisted or disobeyed.\n\nIf these Laws are attended to, no one can question this authority of the Nakhoda; for as the Raja is on shore, so is the Nakhoda at Sea\u2014this authority has been conferred by the Sultan of the Land upon all Nakhodas in order that they may administer the Laws on board their respective vessels\u2014Whoever does not admit this authority offends against the Law.\n\nIt may be necessary to premise, that although the number and description of Persons must materially depend on the size of the vessel, and the nature and extent of the voyage, yet the following classes and denominations will be found to occur in almost every Prahu; a term under which the Malays include every description of vessel.\n\nThe Nakhoda or Captain, who employs a Jurotulis or Writer, corresponding in some degree with a Purser.\n\nThe kiwe or kiwi the principal of which is termed the Mula-Kiwi: Supercargoes, or persons who have an adventure, in the voyage, and to whom part of the cargo belongs.\n\nThe orang Tumpang or Menumpang: Passengers from one Port to another.\n\nOFFICERS AND CREW.\n\nMalim.\u2014The Master: there are generally two denominated the Malim besar and Malim Kechit, the superior and inferior, the latter of whom is the Malim \u201cAngin,\u201d whose duty it is principally to manage the sails according to the wind, the chief Malim, attending to the course of the Prahu.\n\nJuromudi.\u2014Persons who steer the Prahu.\n\nJurobatu.\u2014One who attends the anchor and fore part of the Prahu.\n\nTukang.\u2014Persons, literally workmen, Petty officers having specific duties according to their denominations: as Tukang Petak the officer of the hold. Tukang Agung officer of the\nmainmast or chief Petty officer. *Tukang Kiri* the officer of the larboard or left side. *Tukang Kanan* the officer of the right or starboard side, &c.\n\n*Awak Prahu* or *Anak Prahu.*\u2014The Crew or common men, which may consist either of free men, debtors or slaves.\n\n**OF THE RANK AND AUTHORITY OF THE NAKHODA AND OFFICERS.**\n\nLet every man obey the Nakhoda agreeably to the authority conferred upon him by the Sultan of the land from time immemorial, for he is the Raja while at sea, and although he may be young, he shall be as an *Orang tuha,* or have the authority of age, and administer the Law accordingly.\n\nFirst.\u2014It is the law, that in all Prahus of every description, the Nakhoda shall be as the Raja.\n\nThat the *Juromudi* or Steer-man shall be as the Benda-hara, or Prime Minister; and the *Jurobatus* as Temenggong or chief Peace officer; and it shall be the duty of those to superintend every one, and to negotiate right and wrong within the Prahu.\n\nThat the *Tukang kanan* and the *Tukang kiri,* shall possess a respectable influence and perform duty with the *Tukang Agung.*\n\nThat the *Jurobatu* *Siar,* the *Guntang,* \u2020 and *Senami* (a passenger who works his passage) as well as the *Tukang,* shall be under the immediate orders of the Nakhoda, and all the *Anak Prahu* shall be under the orders of the *Tukang* belonging to the Prahu.\n\nThe Malim shall be as a ruler or judge at Sea, as it is his duty to direct the course of the vessel.\n\nIn the Macassar copy it is stated, that the owner of the Prahu shall be as the Raja, the Nakhoda as the B\u00ebndahara, the Tukang as the Temenggong, the *Tukang Haluan* (officer of the forecastle) as Menris, and the *Tukang Tengah* as Sida Sida\n\n---\n\n*This word appears to mean the \"Superintending\" Jurobatu, who \"walks about\" and looks after his subordinates.

H.\n(guards, eunuchs) \u2014but as the Nakhodas are generally, and always in the smaller Prahus, owners, the distinction made at Macassar is that which changes the comparison.\n\nHakim or Imam in the ranks of the different officers in consequence of the introduction of a superior to the Nakhoda is of no real importance, and does not essentially alter the rank or influence of the officer.\n\nIf any of the Crew disobey the orders of the Tukang Agung, that officer shall deliver the offender over to the Jurobatu, in order that he may be punished with seven stripes, but it is the usage that such stripes shall not be inflicted with an uplifted or powerful arm, nor without the knowledge of the Tukang. If the person who has offended still resists the authority of the Tukang Agung, he shall be punished with four stripes more.\n\nAccording to the Macassar copy, the Anak Prahu are stated to be under the immediate orders of the Tukang Tengah. If any one resists his authority, he shall in the manner above described, be punished in the presence of the Temenggong (Juromudi) with three times seven stripes, and if the offended still resists the authority of the Tukang it shall be lawful for the Temenggong to hang him up (suspend him by the arms) and to punish him with three stripes more.\n\n\"If any of the Crew disobey the Guntang and Senawi, the offender shall be punished with three stripes.\n\nOf the duties of the Officers and Crew, and the nature of their engagements.\n\nThere is no description of persons who receive wages on board a Prahu, with the exception of persons who may act as substitutes for such as may be obliged to quit the Prahu on account of illness or otherwise. Every person on board has some commercial speculation in view, however small; and his engagement is made for the voyage.\n\nThe Nakhoda or owner of the Prahu gives to each according to established custom, what is termed tolongan, which signifies assistance or advances; which advances are of two kinds: consisting either of shares of the cargo, or loan of money.\nIn short, the whole voyage is to be considered as a commercial adventure of the whole of the persons engaged in it; and bears no slight similarity to the out-fit of a Dutch whaler.\n\nOF THE MALIM.\n\n\"The Law respecting the Malim is, that he shall, if he requires it, be allowed one half of a division of the hold; and receive a further assistance from the Nakhoda to the extent of a Tahil and a half (12 Dollars) this officer being on the same footing with the Malim besar or chief Malim.\n\nIt is the duty of the Malim to remember the proper course to steer, and to know the sea and the lands, the wind and the waves; the currents, the depths, and the shallows; the moon and the stars, the years and the seasons; and the bays, and the points of land; the islands and coasts; the rocks and shores, the mountains and hills; each and every of them; and also to know where the Prahu may be at any time; with the whole of these the Malim should be well acquainted, in order that everything may go on prosperously, as well at sea as on land; and that the Malim may be free from fault.\n\nWhile a Prahu is at sea, the Malim again shall have charge of all the cordage, and rigging. He shall give orders respecting the same to the Tukang Agung, whose duty it is to see that the Anak Prahu do what is necessary respecting the same. The Tukang Kiri and Tukang Kanan shall also assist in superintending the Anak Prahu.\"\n\nAccording to the Macassar copy, \"any of the Anak Prahu, who may neglect their duty, or the order of the Tukang, may be punished, at the Petarana Lawangan (fore-hatch) or place where the Cable and ropes are kept, with seven stripes. If everything is not at sea as the Malim wishes it, and the sails are taken aback let him, on his return to Port, give alms to the poor, as an acknowledgement for his escape.\n\nIf the Malim forgets the course he is to steer, and through his ignorance, the Prahu is wrecked, he shall suffer death; for such is the Law.\n\nIf the Malim is desirous of quitting the Prahu, at any port or place, he shall not be permitted to do so.\"\nOF THE JUROMUDIS OR STEER MEN.\n\nIt is the duty of the Juromudis, when relieved from their tour of duty at the helm, to superintend and take care of all the arms in the Prahu. In the event of the Prahu falling in with Pirates, let them combat with a strong hand and courageous heart, for such is their duty.\"\n\nBy the Macassar copy it is established, \"that if the Juromudis or Jurobatus are desirous of quitting the Prahu at any time, they may be permitted to do so on paying, the former, the sum of half a Tahil or one paha (4 or 2 dollars), and the latter, one Paha * or two mas (two or one dollars); each according to his ability, but not exceeding the sums stated.\"\n\nOF THE PETTY OFFICERS AND CREW.\n\n\"If the Prahu is from three to four Depa (fathoms) wide, the Anak Prahu shall be allowed assistance, or a participation in the Cargo to the extent of one Koyan; and all other persons, not slaves, two Koyans.\n\nIf the Prahu is two and a half Depa wide, the Anak Prahu shall be allowed 300 Gantangs, and the others, not slaves, 600 Gantangs.\"\n\nIndependent of the description of persons above alluded to, as belonging to the Prahu, it may be necessary to advert to slaves and debtors, particularly the latter; respecting whom the Law is as follows:\n\n\"When any person wishes to bind himself in personal service for a Debt, let an agreement be required at the time that the debtor shall follow and perform service for his creditor for the term of three years, three months and three days\" or according to the Macassar copy \"for the term of three years; in order that if the party is not willing to conform thereto, he may not become a debtor; or if willing to do so, that he may follow and serve his Creditor accordingly.\"\n\n* 4 \"paha\" make one \"tahil,\" and each of them is divided into 4 \"mas\" of which there are 16 to a \"tahil\" they are valued in Kalantan at \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) a dollar.

They shall pay for the tonnage they require, unless they have assisted the Nakhoda in his trading concerns to the extent of three or four Tahils (24 or 32 dollars); in which case the Nakhoda shall give them two three Koyans of Tonnage, or one division of the hold; it being considered that the profit on three or four Tahils is an adequate compensation.\n\n\u201cThe Kiwi may obtain seven or eight divisions of the hold, but they shall not pay for four divisions as long as they are under agreement to pay a duty on their return to port (on the goods they load) at the rate of 4 out of every 13.\n\n\u201cThe Mula Kiwi shall be entitled to half of the division of the hold* in which the Rice or provisions are stowed (Petak Gandung); because he is the Punghulu or head man of all the Kiwi.\n\n\u201cWith respect to the duties of the country on the sales, it is the Law, that the Kiwi shall present eight pieces of cloth and a bundle of Rattans.

If the Slave of an Orang besar or of a Bendahara, is stolen, the Nakhoda shall be fined 10 Tahils 1 Paha (42 Dollars). If the Slave of a Teman Rayet (common person) is stolen by the Nakhoda he shall not only return the Slave but pay a fine in addition equal to the value of the Slave.\"\n\n\"If the Nakhoda carries off the Slave of the Shahbandar, the Law directs that his effects shall be seized and he shall be fined, because he has no respect and attention for the Country but in his case the Raja may pardon him if he thinks proper.\"\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nOf Crimes and Punishment on Board a Prahu.\n\n\"There are four Cases, in which, it is lawful to inflict Capital punishment on board a Prahu.\"\n\n(* ) Chiefs.\u2014W.

F. A. HERVEY.\n\nRead at a Meeting of the Society held on the 13th October, 1879.\n\nHaving previously visited Gunong Pulei (in 1876) Gunong Panti and Gunong Mentahak (in 1877), and having on the two latter trips heard a good deal of Gunong Blumut as a mountain far superior in magnitude and height, distant a long way inland, at least 7 days journey, to which seemed attached a good deal of superstitious veneration, I had long been desirous of making an attempt to reach this latter mountain; and Mr. Hullett (Principal of Raffles' Institute), who had also made trips to the other mountains above mentioned, being ready to join me, I obtained a month's leave, and on the 21st January we started on our expedition in a steam launch very kindly lent us for the purpose by Captain Burrows.\n\nWe left Singapore at 8.15 a.m. just as it was beginning to clear after a continuous rainfall of two days and reached Pulau Tekong at 10.45 a.m. Here we stopped for water and got under way again at 11.55. The rain which now began again continued to fall steadily till we reached Panchur some 18 miles up the Johor river, at 2.45 p.m. Up to this point our course had been pretty well N.N.W., but above Panchur the river takes a due northerly direction. Below Panchur the Channel is on the east side, extensive shallows and sand-banks prevailing to the west. At this place we landed, and found it in charge of Che Masim, who succeeded Che Musa, (a most agreeable and obliging man, who accompanied me on my trip to Gunong Mentahak at the end of 1877, and who had, I was sorry to hear, succumbed a few months before to fever [caught on an expedition into the interior.) Che Masim was very civil, but we were told on all sides that in the present swollen condition of the river it was hopeless to think of reaching Blumut. Having got our luggage on shore and despatched the launch back to\nSingapore, we had assigned to us as quarters the house formerly occupied by Che Musa close to the river, which was now in a somewhat dilapidated condition but still occupied, the inmates insisted upon turning out and giving up to us the inside room of which, it must be confessed, we were glad, for the outer room was very offensive and after a tolerable dinner prepared by our China boys we had a good night\u2019s rest without curtains. It rained all day persistently, but it was starlight when we went to bed. We were told that the river was running so high that many of the \u201cKangkas,\u201d (Chinese Gambier or Pepper stations) were submerged up to the roof.\n\nThe next morning, the 22nd, though we were anxious to take advantage of the flood tide, the usual Malay delays prevailed and we could not get off in the j\u00e0lor (dug out) with which Che Masim provided us till after 9 a. m.\n\nFrom the rising ground by the river side just above Panchur there is a very pretty view, giving Pulei just opposite in the far West, and to the right the bend of the river with Panti and M\u00ebntahak in the distance. Panchur itself is said to owe its name to an ivory conduit made by a former Raja to bring water to a pond in which he and his household might disport themselves. Large stones perforated with holes are also to be found on the banks of the river which are said to be memorials left by the AChinese of a conquering visit paid to Johor in the early part of the 17th century; they are supposed to be parts of anchors, and are called \u201cbatu anting-anting.\u201d\n\nAt 11 a. m. we reached Sungei Bukit B\u00ebran\u00ebgan, (Arsenic Hill River) which we entered in search of Che Jalil the P\u00ebnghulu of the place, to procure fresh men to take us on to Kota Tinggi, the current with the ebb being too strong for the same crew to take us so far. We had left Panchur at 9.5 a. m. with a course N. by W. after which Gunong Panti came into view. At 9.20 the course changed to N. W. by W. till 10.40, when we reached Gonggong, on which the course became W. N. W. \u201cGonggong\u201d is a common sea-shell and the name of this place is owing probably to the abundance of these shells there; here formerly tin used to be worked; and gold was also found in 1847. At present there is a pretty numerous settlement of Chinese Pepper and Gambier-planters.\nWe had to go for about \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) a mile up the Bukit Berangan River before we came upon Che Jalil, who was very ready and obliging, and who to our great relief made the same boats go on with us, merely adding a couple of paddles to each; we found him engaged clearing ground for a betelnut plantation; there seemed to be a good many Malay clearings here with fruit trees and good sized houses. We heard that a \"Sladang,\" the bison of the Peninsula, had passed close to the house of a Malay in the outskirts of this place a day or two before. On leaving this small tributary and getting into the main stream again we found the current so strong that it very nearly carried us away in spite of our two extra paddles, and we actually lost ground for a short time, but ultimately succeeded in making our way into a less impetuous current and making progress. We heard that a Johor steam launch was waiting at Panti to bring back Mr. Hill and Che Yahya on their return from Blumut. Close to Gonggong is Sungei Serei (Lemon-grass River), near the mouth of which lies Pulau Sarang Dendang, (crow's nest Island) and immediately after come Berangan Hill and River. \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) mile further up is Pulau Linau (a red stemmed variety of betelnut) just at the mouth of the Seluyut River, on the banks of which rises a hill of the same name, which would be a capital site for a bungalow, 6 hours' steam from Singapore; the strait between the island and the main is called Selat Medinah. There are Chinese plantations up the Seluyut River. Just after this point the main river takes a sharp bend to the right, and henceforward its course continues for the most part very winding, resembling in this respect the majority of the Peninsula rivers. About a mile higher up on the left we came to Galah Si Badang (the punting pole of Si Badang), the execution place of former days and the scene of one of the many notable deeds performed by Si Badang, the Hercules of Malay legend. It is said that when the river is low the stump of a tree is to be seen, the stem of which (some 18 inches in diameter) Si Badang broke off and used as a pole to propel his boat against the stream. Nearly opposite is Merdalam, and a little further up Sungei Naga Malor.\n\nProceeding another \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) mile we reach Sungei Menchok, and \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) a mile higher on the left the river and hill of Penatih, and about the same distance beyond them Bukit China: on the right again is Pulau Patani, the residence of Patani men,\nA mile further on is Tanah S\u00ebroh, (Sunken soil) the scene of a terrible catastrophe said to have taken place long ago, a sudden subsidence of the soil which buried the whole kampong with its inhabitants. This calamity is attributed to a tremendous fall of rain brought about by the unlucky conduct of a boy in swinging a frog in a cloth like a child. There is a similar legend prevailing about a kampong named Kel\u00e9bur in Pahang, which likewise met with sudden destruction owing to the misconduct of two little girls. Not far above this at a bend of the river on the same side Batu S\u00e5wa comes into view, with red and white soil shewing on the bank where the river has eaten into rising ground. Just beyond is Tanjong Putus (severed Point) indicating no doubt the spot which the river, as it often does during the rainy season, has cut right across the neck of a bend and made for itself another channel. A short way beyond on the left may be descried with some trouble a tiny creek which bears the name of D\u00e5nau S\u00ebr\u00e1, (Midge Lake); it widens out a little way from the main stream into a lake, which from its name may be supposed to rejoice in swarms of a little stinging creature more minute than the redoubtable \u201cagas\u201d (sand-fly). Turning our eyes once more to the right we find ourselves facing Pengkalan Rambei [Rambeetree, (bearing a well-known fruit) landing-place], not far below Sungei Damar (Pitch tree River); and close above this latter is Kota Tinggi, once the residence of Royalty; the only remaining marks of its former greatness however are slight traces of a fort, and two cemeteries, one close to the kampong surrounded by a low wall of laterite and containing the tombs of the former sovereigns, and the other nearly a mile off in the jungle which contains the tombs, some of them handsomely carved, of the B\u00ebndah\u00e0ras, the predecessors, it is said, of those who took charge and ultimately became the independent rulers of Pahang; among these is also the tomb of one Yam-Tuan. It is much to be regretted that none of these tombs have any inscription or even a date. Behind the kampong is Padang Saujana a wide plain the further part of which is well stocked with cocoanut palms and various fruit-trees; this may be looked upon as a sign of former prosperity, in fact it is frequently the only indication remaining of human occupation in places once well peopled and highly prosperous.\n\nWe reached Kota Tinggi at 5 p.m. and in half an hour the Pengh\u00fblu and Che Kasim, a Malay acquainted with Singa-\npore, made their appearance, and the latter gave us quarters in his house, a fine large one conveniently close to the creek which forms the landing place. After dinner we produced the Maharaja's letter, and it was then agreed by the Malays assembled that we must be helped on our journey, and Dato' Derasap (the Penghulu) was to have the letter explained to him next morning.\n\nNext morning, 23rd, we set off along a path passing first through the kampong and then through the jungle for the \"Kangka\" (settlement) of Tan Tek Seng the \"Kangchu\" (river-head) of this district, which we reached after a walk of about a mile. We found Tek Seng ready to sell us some of his rice, and very civil; he regaled us with tea, sweets, and some splendid oranges fresh from China, which I never saw the like of out of Gibraltar. From some rising ground at the back of his house in a pepper garden he shewed us a view of Panti and Meutabak. Che Kasim vigorously denied that the keel-like end of Panti was called Banang and the far end Panti, (as I had been informed by an old experienced guide, Che Moa of Panchur, sent with me by the Maharaja on a former trip), saying that Gunong Banang was in a different part of the country; it is true that there are hills of that name on the West coast of Johor near the mouth of the Batu Pahat river, but it is so common for the same name to occur more than once that I do not see in that any reason for disbelieving the statement of Che Moa. On our return to Kota Tinggi we heard that the steam-launch was at Pengkalan Petet, and we were only kept from paying it a visit by the still persistent rain. Meanwhile a message came from Tek Seng inviting us to dine with him at 4.30 p.m., and we were making ready to set off again for the \"Kangka,\" when a Malay boy brought word that a \"kapal api\" was coming down the river; so we ran down to the landing-place and after waiting a few minutes heard the \"puff-puff\" of the launch long before we saw her; we \"cooehed\" and shouted \"stop her\" as loud as we could, and had the satisfaction of seeing her turn round after she had passed our creek, and make for it again, where she was fastened to a stake near the bank; Hullett and I went out to her a jalor, and made ourselves known to Hill. We of course plied him freely with questions on the subject of Blumut and the way to it, we gathered that we should get there without great difficulty; not more than half a mile of swamp on the way. The height was 3,190 ft. by his\naneroid, the soil very fair, perhaps not so good as Panti, plenty of ferns and plants, he had been obliged to throw the bulk of his away; as Hill wanted to be off and the launch, in spite of the rope, was steaming hard to avoid being carried away by the current, we had to bring our questions to an end, so away went the launch with a jakun they had brought from the interior, while we returned on shore and started for the \"kangka\" to get our dinner with the \"kangchu.\" No one would have guessed from our costume that we were on our way to dine with probably the wealthiest planter in Johor, the owner of about 100 plantations, but our dress was suited to the road by which we had to travel, most of the way ankle-deep in mud, and occasionally swamps with a partial and very insecure floating-bridge of poles. We reached the kangka about 5 p.m. bare-legged and bare-footed, splashed and smeared with mud, but with the help of a cooly and a pail of water, we soon set that right, and joined our jovial host in doing justice to his plentiful but not varied fare. He was very talkative, said the Maharajah was very good (an assertion we were neither able nor disposed to dispute) but that the Singapore Towkays were trying to \"pusing\" (cheat) him about the Gambier or some other \"chukei\" (dues). The tigers, he said, did not trouble his neighbourhood, but in Scluang district, (as we had already heard) were numerous and had been committing dreadful havoc among the Chinese plantation coolies, who for some superstitious reason would not take any steps to put a stop to this wholesale destruction of human life; the Chinese vegetable gardeners in Singapore seem less influenced by such notions, for they find no difficulty in setting spring-guns for tigers. We were told that any cooly speaking of the tiger by proper name was liable to a fine of $10. We questioned our host about gambling, which system he thought best, the Singapore plan of (attempted) suppression, or the Johore license, we could not obtain a definite answer but gathered that, while he admitted gambling did a great deal of harm, and professional gamblers always win and frequently cheated, still the coolies were very much devoted to it, and were willing to risk ruining themselves; (ergo, they should be allowed to do so, especially as our friend draws his share of profit from the system). We left at 8.30 agreeably impressed with our host, a man who deserves his position, for he started here 17 years ago in a small plantation with a capital of $500. We saw the gambling system in full play, it being the Chinese New Year, when\nthe coolies are given 5 days uninterrupted holiday, but even that limitation is not always strictly adhered to, for the towkays can afford a little liberality in this respect, seeing that anyhow they get the money of their coolies who are dependent on them for supplies of all kinds the whole year round. Towkays will sometimes keep on working a mine or plantation after it has ceased to pay, for the sake of the money they can make out of the coolies.\n\nWe returned about 9 p.m. by Sungei Pemandi in a sampan, getting glimpses in the darkness partly relieved by torchlight of grand ferns drooping over the water. On reaching the house we learnt that the Penghulu objected to our starting next day till after the service of the \"surau,\" i.e., till 1 p.m. or 2 p.m., we agreed to this, though further delay was annoying, as we did not see our way to combating such an objection.\n\nFriday 24th.\u2014The second fine morning since we left Singapore, though unable to start till the afternoon, we resolved to get off as soon after the service as we could, so we put all our things together ready for a start, including 3 pikuls of rice for the boatmen and coolies we should take with us. All being ready, and there being 2 or 3 hours to dispose of we got a \"jalor\" and went up the Pemandi, in search of plants and ferns, our curiosity having been excited by what we saw the night before on our trip down the stream from the \"kangka.\" But the torchlight, effective though it was from a scenic point of view, proved somewhat deceptive, for with the exception of one variety of lycopodium we returned empty-handed, the ferns being all common. I added the names of a few plants to my vocabulary, which I always seize the opportunity of doing whenever I get the chance; in this direction there is still a great deal to be done, as well as in a general way, but some care is necessary, as the Malays sooner than confess their ignorance, will often give a wrong name. As regards the general vocabulary I do not believe much more than half the language has yet been recorded, Logan in his journal states that he already possessed a list of words exceeding that in Marsden's Dictionary, by 3,000 and that he was so constantly increasing his stock that he did not propose at that time to take any steps with a view to publication. It is much to be desired that the Society should secure the vocabulary referred to. The Penghulu of the place, Dato' Derasap, is a gentleman of the old school, to\nwhom nothing is so unpleasant as taking action in any matter, and had it not been for the Maharaja's letter, we should no doubt have found him immovable, but with Che Kasim's aid we succeeded in getting off at 3.30 p.m. in a couple of \"jalor,\" Che Kasim's being a very fine one, but we were undermanned, and after an unsuccessful attempt to get another paddler from a Malay house a little way up the river, we had to struggle on as we were. The first place passed on leaving Kota Tinggi is Sungei Tembiok a little higher on the opposite (right) bank, while a little higher on the Kota side is the Sungei Pemandi already mentioned. Close above this on the same side is Pulau Pahang where the Pahangites took up their quarters on visiting Johor, and which became a sort of settlement. Half a mile or so further up, still on the same side is Sungei Kemang, and crossing to the other side about quarter mile further up we reach Pengkalan Poetei; here we arrived about 5 p.m. and having decided on nighting here, we went to see the towkay of the \"kangka\" who, being hospitably disposed, told us we were welcome to take up our quarters at his house, and we lost no time in availing ourselves of his offer. This \"kangka\" is situated at a bend of the river on a plateau some 60 feet or so above it, and from the upper story a fine view of Panti may be had, part of Mentahak can be seen, but the rest is hidden by the roof of a bangsal (i.e., cooly shed.) Some 8 or 9 years ago a Mr. Geech? held land here. He was also the first to work tin at Seluang. The jungle about here is very pretty and from what we see of it, offers satisfactory occupation for the plant-collector. The towkay shewed some interest in the question of coffee-planting and made a good many inquiries about it, seemed rather to fear the advent of the European planter. Incessant gambling going on here all night too.\n\nSaturday 25th.\u2014Two men from the place where we had expected to find them yesterday joined our boats this morning and we started at 7 a.m. Passing Sungei Bedil* on our right about \u00bd mile up, and \u00bc mile further on the left Sungei Penaga (from the hard wood of that name) at 9.30 a.m., we reached K. Panti. Here we stopped for breakfast and put off again at 10 a.m. taking with us a Chinaman bound for Seluang who was to work his passage, and he plied his paddle with an energy which put to shame most of our crew. The scenery\n\n* Said to owe its name to a booming sound which its emits under certain circumstances.\nalong the river is very pretty, the jungle being diversified by the blossom-like white leaves of the shrub called by the Malays \"b\u0101lik h\u0101dap\" (hindside before.) Another constantly recurring feature is the \"r\u0101sau,\" a palm-like sort of tree which lines the banks and bobs and bows its pine-like crown before the rushing current; like other beautiful things its only use is to be looked at. The r\u014dtan (rattan) also often lends a charm to the scene with its great feathery fronds climbing high up the trees. Saw some flying-foxes (k\u0113l\u016bang) flying high, we had seen a few yesterday evening. From K. Panti there is a jungle path passing through two or three plantations to the mountain of the same name, the top of which may be reached in six or seven hours; there is a shanty on the south face of the summit, whence at the end of a long stretch of jungle besprinkled with plantations may be descried the mouth of the Johor River with the neighbouring islands and beyond them the Island of Singapore; westward, beyond a similar expanse of jungle rises the P\u016blei range blue in the distance. To this view that presented from the north and north-west offers a startling contrast, the moment you get through the jungle and find yourself on the edge of the mountain the whole view is one sea of mountains from one to three thousand feet high; G. S\u0113mbel\u0101yang or Asahan, G. M\u0113ntahak, G. L\u0113song, Gunong B\u016blan S. Ch\u014dndia P\u0101lau, S. Timbun t\u016blang, Bukit (or P\u0113n\u0101li) Panjang, G. P\u0113ny\u0101bong, and Bl\u016bmut were among the names given, but the native is not very reliable on these points, and these names therefore require verification. To the northeast the sea can be descried with P. Tinggi and further north P. Babi, and in clear weather P. Ti\u014dman would probably be visible. Due north between S. Timbun t\u016blang and P. Tinggi lies a comparatively level space up to the foot of the north side of Panti. Panti is a very peculiar hill in appearance, with its long straight back and abrupt western end it suggests the keel of a capsized boat, like the Tangkuban Prahu in Java. It is said that an anchor and rope is to be found somewhere on the summit, where it is also asserted mangrove grow, but it is hardly necessary to say that I could find no traces of either the one or the other. The soil on the top is black and peaty-looking, here and there are moist hollows with a good deal of moss: I was surprised to find the \"r\u0101sau\" up here and other vegetation usually characteristic of a low and damp level; it must, I suppose, be attributed to the low temperature and moist soil. Under this black soil is a white sand, which is succeeded by a white semi-indurated sand-\nstone; as far as I could see the mass of the hill consists of more or less indurated sandstone, on the side of the hill boulders of very hard sandy brown sandstone are to be met with; and there must also be granite, for I found granite in the stream half way up the hill, but they were water-worn pieces, the rock there was sandstone. On the way up I came across a tortoise about 18 in. by a foot, but could not find any means of securing him. I forgot to mention the delightful little spring at the top, giving forth coffee-coloured water, which is, notwithstanding its hue, perfectly sweet and good. It is the only hill I know of here which has water actually on the summit. The soil on this hill looks better than any I have seen hitherto in this country, with the exception perhaps of some on the way to Bl\u00fbmut.\n\nTo return to our journey. Having left K. Panti about 10 a.m., at about 2 p.m. we reached Ch\u00ebngk\u00ebdam on the left, where there is a Kangka about 150 yards from the river, the shed on the river bank was submerged to about half way up the roof. When we got to the \"Kangka\" the towkay, after regaling us with tea and oranges, took us to some rising ground lately cleared, behind the present buildings; there he said he should erect a new Kangka, the site of the present one being too low, considering the height to which the river sometimes rises in the wet season. The new site promises a fine view. The current was very strong, and our progress very slow so far, we put it at not more than $1\\frac{1}{2}$ miles an hour, at some bend we actually lost ground for a time. Before we got to Ch\u00ebngk\u00ebdam, on reaching a turn in the river, where the current seemed to have died away, an old Malay in the bows of our \"jalar\" remarked \"har'mau makan h\u00e2rus\" (a tiger is swallowing the stream), to explain the sudden stillness of the stream, an illustration of the powers popularly ascribed to this animal. After having an easy course for about ten minutes, we came again into the full current, which we found had avoided the usual windings and taken a more direct line through the jungle, these are no doubt the occasions on which a \"Tanjong P\u00fbtus\" is formed, the old bed getting silted up, and the new channel worn deeper and deeper. We had two heavy showers after leaving Ch\u00ebngk\u00ebdam, and reached Sel\u00fbang about 5 p.m., and landed all our luggage and stores in the \"surau,\" the floor of which was only two feet above the water, though in a previous visit it had been high and dry above the bank. As we sighted the first houses of the kampong, our Chinese passenger bestirred\nhimself, drawing from the Malay the remark \"Ah China pula bangau,\" hinting at his instinctive feeling that he was once more within reach of his countrymen. The P\u0113ngh\u016blu of the place, Che Husain, came to see us a few minutes after we landed; we handed him the Mahar\u0101ja's general letter and another addressed to himself; after reading them he said he would have men and boats ready for us by 1 p.m. next day, a sign of promptitude as pleasing as it was novel. Found more men who had been to Bl\u016bnut with Hill and Che Gayha, and did not gather from them that there were any great difficulties in the way; they evidently looked upon Mr. Hill's walking powers with an uncomfortable sort of respect, and devoutly hoped we should not drag them along at such a pace, regardless of supplies. Quinine was highly appreciated and was given with other medicines to parties complaining of various ailments. At 8.15 p.m. thermometer was 78\u00b0. At 6.30 a.m. next morning 73\u00b0, this morning, Sunday the 26th, we increased our supply of rice to 4 pikuls and got a few luxuries for the Malays. The river still as high as ever; in December, 1877, it was supposed to be very high, but it was not as high as this by 8 or 9 feet, which is said to be the greatest rise for the last 8 or 10 years; the fact that this was the second rise during the present rains was given as a reason for not expecting any more really heavy rain. The general opinion was that the rains would continue till the close of the Chinese New Year. This place, S\u0113luang, forms the starting-point of the traveller bound for G. M\u0113ntahak, the way lies through jungle and a whole string of deserted tin-mines, the last of which is close to the foot of the mountain, being separated from it by one of those delightful sandy-bedded streams which are happily not rare in these jungles. The ascent of M\u0113ntahak is not an undertaking of any great difficulty; the path, as in most other mountains, follows the ridge, there is one stiffish climb more than half way up, but that does not take long. If it is not practicable to reach the summit in the same day, the best place to encamp is at a dip in the ridge at about 1,000 feet, where there is water close at hand. A distinguishing feature in this mountain is the prevalence of the \"d\u0101un p\u0101yong\" a gigantic leaf from 10 to 15 feet long and from $2\\frac{1}{2}$ to 4 feet or more broad; you have simply to cut a dozen, stick them in the ground by their stalks, and scatter a few on the ground for a carpet, and in two or three minutes you have a luxurious green roofed hut giving complete shelter; I brought one or two of these leaves to Singapore with me, and they\nwere deposited in the Museum. Granite crops up on this mountain, but there were no large boulders visible, the soil appears pretty good, better than what I have seen hitherto excepting that on Panti. My reckoning of the elevation with one aneroid was 1,950 feet, the same as the lower peak of Pulei, while Mr. Hill makes it 2,197 feet, so, as my aneroid agreed with Mr. Hill as to the height of Panti, 1,650 feet South face, I suspect that I did not reach the true summit, though I took a good deal of trouble in trying to do so, and reached the point which was called so, and which I was told was that reached by Maclay a year or two before; the view inland from this mountain is very fine, finer even than that from Panti. Here as elsewhere when out of reach of water, the traveller can get a cool drink from some of the numerous hanging ropes and supple jacks he comes across along the path; a section of one of these, three or four feet long, will give half a pint of water, sometimes most delicious sweet water, others give a water slightly acrid, but quite drinkable. I give the names of some of these water-giving \"okar\" as the Malays call them, viz.: sbras, bl\u00e9rang, \u010dmp\u010dlas (the \u010dmp\u010dlas hold second place as to water supply), r\u010dlang (this gives the most water and has an edible fruit), jitan (fruit edible), bibat (red fruit not edible, shoots edible, water plentiful), j\u0161l\u0101 (fruit edible), g\u0119grip (edible fruit very pleasant), k\u0161b\u0101d\u0101 (pleasant edible fruit), garok (fruit edible,) k\u0161krang (fruit edible). As far as one could see, there was not much variety in the way of ferns or orchids on this mountain. The master of S\u010db\u0101dang, the Malay champion, was a S\u010dl\u016bang man, Sebadang himself being a native of Sayong. After leaving S\u010dl\u016bang at 3.15 p.m. we passed one more Kangka, the furthest up the river. We stopped for the night at a place called Kampong B\u0101tu Hampar, consisting of two or three somewhat impoverished looking huts; we were told, however, that there were two or three more further away from the river bank out of sight; they were cultivating sugar-cane, plantains and kl\u00e9d\u00e9s, also tapioca in a small way. The land this side the river (right bank), consists mainly of p\u010drm\u0101tangs (ridges); the hollows between them were just now filled with water, which served to keep away the tigers which usually infest the neighbourhood. We were given a deserted and very much dilapidated shanty to put up in for the night, but with a few additional kajangs from the boat and my waterproof sheet hung up at the side, we contrived to get tolerably sheltered: but we should have cared but little about this if we could have been free from those tor-\nmenting little sand-flies which tortured us all night, piercing through everything, wrap ourselves up as we might. The Batu Hampar, which gives its name to this place, is a \"Kr\u00e2mat,\" a sacred rock in the river, on which the devout spread the mat of prayer; it owes its sanctity, according to the legend, to the execution on it by order of the Yam T\u00fban of Kota Tinggi, of one Jit, P\u00ebngh\u00fblu of the Jakuns, who had been detected in necromantic practices. When they came after the execution with the burial garments to take away the body, it had disappeared. Three months after he was met alive and well on the same spot by his son, and from that period he used to haunt the spot. He is also said to assume at times the form of a white cock; when met in human form, he disappears, and a white cock is seen vanishing in the distance. Between S\u00e9l\u00fbang and B\u00e2tu Hampar, S. R\u00ebm\u00fbroh, S. R\u00e2mun, (tree bearing a sub-acid fruit) S. S\u00f4lok, (a certain knife), we passed S. G\u00e2jah (elephant), S. Landak (porcupine), P\u00f4kok Mahong, S. Lahan, S. S\u00e9l\u00e0sa (a pleasure house), P\u00e2sir R\u00e2ja and Rantau R\u00e2ja, Malay houses on left at intervals of 7 minutes; S. D\u00ebrh\u00e2ka, and S. S\u00ebtonggeng both on the left, and B\u00e2tu S\u00e2w\u00e2. Of the above places most take their names from trees or animals, P\u00e2sir R\u00e2ja (King sand or strand) and Rantau R\u00e2ja (King Reach) require no further expianation. S. G\u00ebm\u00fbroh takes its name from the rushing sound of the stream there; there is an island of the same name close by. S. D\u00ebrh\u00e2ka or S. Anak D\u00ebrh\u00e2ka as it is also called, and S. S\u00ebtonggeng derive their names, according to the Malay legend in this case as in many others, from incidents which it is difficult to describe in seemly language; however S\u00ebtonggeng (the stooper) was the step-mother of Anak D\u00ebrh\u00e2ka (the rebellious son). One day S\u00ebtonggeng was stooping picking up sticks, and in hitching up her dress she made a gesture which was misconstrued by her son, who thereupon assaulted her in a way which caused her to turn round and give him such a tremendous kick that he was heaved to the spot where flows the stream to which he has given his name, and Setonggeng herself was converted into the stream which bears her name. The two streams are about a quarter of a mile apart. Batu S\u00e2w\u00e2 (fishing-weir rock) marks the spot where, says tradition, S\u00ebb\u00e2dang picked up a rock to make way for his weir.\n\nWe left Kwala B\u00e2tu Hampar at 9 11 a.m., and in a few minutes passed a river of the same name, and in 10 minutes had passed the clearing on the same side, and found big\njungle on both sides. On one of the trees we noticed a very fine fern with long grass-like leaves, a non-botanist would liken it to a delicate variety of hart\u2019s-tongue; the hart\u2019s-tongue, or bird\u2019s-nest fern, is called \u201cp\u00f4kok s\u00e2kat\u201d by the Malays, and the stag\u2019s horn, of which we now came upon some very fine specimens, \u201cp\u00e2su putri\u201d (princess\u2019s bowl).\n\nAt L\u00fbbok K\u00ebndur (gourd hole), 9.41 a.m., we came across some \u201cr\u00e2sau\u201d again and ten minutes later we passed Tanjong Blit. Shortly after we noticed a fine specimen of \u201cp\u00f4kok r\u00e2wa, a beautiful round-topped tree with thick-set, glossy, dark-green leaves, which bears a pleasant fruit. At 10.11 a.m. we pass on the left S. D\u00e2un Lab\u00fbh, and at 10.24 a.m. T\u00e2uah D\u00e2par on the same side. At 10.37 a.m. we pass S. P\u00ealang P\u00fbtus (severed-boat river), here the jungle on both sides is very beautiful. According to tradition the river just mentioned owes its name to one of the numerous feats of Se B\u00e2dang; it is stated that he and his wife N\u00eanek Panjang went out in a p\u00ealang boat together fishing, she in the bows and he at the stern, and that each, seeing a fish at their respective ends, paddled in opposite directions, and paddled with such force that the boat parted in two in the middle. It will be seen from the above that Nenek Panjang was a fair match for her husband in physical prowess, her great powers are attributed to a circular root (akar gandir) which she found lying on the ground like a hoop, and which when she put it on fitted her waist exactly; she never took it off, and from that time she equalled her husband in strength. The legend further narrates that she bore a child to the Jin Kelembei, from whom her husband obtained his gift of great strength.\n\nAt 11.13 we passed J\u00e2lor P\u00fbtus (a rock to the left which occasioned the damage referred to). At 11.26 we sighted Tanjong P\u00earak, the point between the L\u00ebnggiu and the S\u00e2yong; at 11.31 we entered the L\u00ebnggiu with a sharp turn to the East, the S\u00e2yong being N.W. we found the L\u00ebnggiu quite sluggish, all the force of the current in the Johor being apparently contributed by the Sayong. In half an hour trees began to get in the way, both sides of the stream, which is not often more than 20 yards broad and very winding, and if possible more beautiful than before. At 12.10 p.m. we passed Sungei Kemanggit, and at 12.22 we came upon three wood cutters\u2019 huts to the left, little cramped huts set upon tall and somewhat slight poles; here we stopped for tiffin till 1.12 p.m. At 1.38 p.m. we passed Sungei S\u00e2dei, at 3 p.m. a Jakun\u2019s clearing and hut on the right; 3.21 Sungei S\u00ebbang\non the right. At 3.35 we went over Lobang Ajar with powerful current and whirlpool. At 4.5 p.m. on our left was Pasir B\u00e9rh\u00e2la (idol sand) of which no clear account was given. At 4.36 had half an hour\u2019s work in cutting through a tree fallen across the stream, and now the opportunity was taken of cutting some poles for \u201cg\u00e2la\u201d to punt us along with, and we certainly got along half again as fast as with the paddles. At 4.18 p.m. we passed Pulau Tanjong Putus, at 5.37 L\u00fbbok tirok, at 6.6 p.m. Sungei Tengkil. Jungle can be touched on both sides. At 6.19 Sungei M\u00e2chap flows in to the right. After cutting our way through more fallen trees, we reached Gajah Minah (where Messrs. Hill and Yahya had put up for a night), about 5 minutes past 7. p.m. For more than half an hour we had been enjoying a delicious evening with the light of the young moon; I could not ascertain how this place had got its name. The only sign of humanity about it is a very elementary sort of shanty, which scarcely deserves the name of hut, and looks as if half a roof had fallen to the ground and had been afterwards propped up by sticks in a slanting position; we preferred the j\u00e2l\u00f4r for sleeping quarters, the shanty and its neighbourhood abounding in leeches. The said shanty was put up by a rattan-cutter; we were told that a Chinaman had been carried off here by a tiger one year ago, and a Malay two years ago. We must have had to cut through a dozen trees or more during the day. Every now and again everything had to be taken out of the boat and put on a tree and then the boat could just scrape under, we were also constantly having to lie flat; about three hours were lost with these constant stoppages. During the wet season, it is only the L\u00ebnggiu in which snags, etc. are so unpleasantly familiar; the Johor is free from them as far as boats of light draught are concerned, indeed during our trip, a steam launch could quite well have gone up as far as the mouth of the L\u00ebnggiu. The Johor river is certainly a fine one, but in the L\u00ebnggiu, though narrower, the beauty of the scenery increases; some of the winding bits are wonderfully lovely, rattans everywhere adding to their charm and variety with their beautiful featherlike sprays; the monkey-ropes hanging gracefully here and there, their pale tint limning out with delicious contrast the cool dark green of the leafy walls around them. In places the under soil has the prevailing red hue of Singapore but it is mostly sandy, though occasionally it appears to be of a better quality. Now and again whitish clay under-lies the red.\nTuesday, 28th.\u2014To-day was simply a repetition of yesterday, saving for the increase of snags and fallen timber. At 12.43 we passed on our right Sempang Mahaligei (palace) where used to be the Royal fishing box. 12.46, huts to the left, 1.25, S. Aye Puthih on right. At 1.30 saw a beautiful musang in a trap up in a tree, trap consisted of two or three sticks fastened from bough to bough the intervals being filled with thorny rattan leaves; he was struggling desperately for his freedom, but apparently in vain, when just as one of our men had climbed nearly up to him, by a frantic effort he got loose, and was out of sight in a moment. At 1.38 passed Lubok Bilik on our left, said to be a \"Kramat,\" but we got no details. At 1.57 we had Sungai Tengkalah on our left, and at 2.8 Sungai Tempinis: Sungai or Pengkalan Tengkalah is the place where Logan re-embarked for Singapore on his return from his trip in 1847 up the Endau river and through the interior of Johor. Its name derives from a fish, and in former days it was one of the retreats of Royalty. 2.10, Jakun hut in clearing on the right, and again at 2.39. At 5.26 p.m. we reached the limited Kampong of Kelasa Baniak, occupied by both Malays and Jakuns; there were three huts on the bank, the huts were very low on high piles, two of them were thatched with daun payong, or umbrella leaf, which added much to their picturesque appearance. The better part of the day had been wet, and we were still forced to have our \"kajang\" up, and, as before, we dined and slept on board our jalor. We were not allowed to continue our wanderings on shore before dinner, our men assuring us that at dusk in that neighbourhood we were not at all unlikely to meet a roaming tiger. This place is named from a fish, Kelasa, which is said to abound here and is described as having upper part dark green, belly white, and large scales. The river had, we were told, been much higher a few days before, about 12 feet, as we judged, above its present level. Next day (29th) we took on a Malay and two Jakuns, more poling and a great deal of cutting work, the stream narrowed so much that there was but just room for the jalor to pass. We saw more hill coffee shrubs with good-sized berries on the banks of the river as we passed. A little before 4 p.m. we got into the Teba river, leaving the Lenggiu on our left; a little way up the Teba, we found ourselves at the Pengkalan, the residence of the Penghulu or Batin of the Jakuns; as we neared his hut, some women and squalling children scrambled away, apparently alarmed at the sudden invasion of the strange orang\nputch. We found the hut much superior to any we had seen since leaving S\u00e9luang in size, construction, accommodation and comfort; it was thatched with a leaf resembling nipah, and the flooring was a bark one, the best portion of it being covered with mats, on which we deposited our sleeping-gear. We then went out into the garden in search of ferns, &c., and our curiosity was rewarded by some capital specimens found among the decaying logs which cumbered the ground; the garden contained some fine tapioca, sugar-cane, plantains, and kl\u00e8dek; the Batin kept a few fowls and also a dog, which he used in the chase of the smaller jungle deer. Not long after our arrival a very queer old man came to see us, who was introduced as the Batin L\u00e2ma or Dato; he is the father of the present Batin, who was then away on the Endau. The old man spoke Malay fluently, but with a peculiar accent, broader than that of the Malays and sounding the final k much more distinctly. I asked him if he remembered Mr. Logan\u2019s visit some 30 years before, he said he did, and also that of M. Favre; on the occasion of the latter he was living in the Sayong where there are two Jakun kampongs, some 30 people in all; he was described by M. Favre as an old man of 80, according to which he must have attained the extraordinary age of 110, but he is now probably not much over 80, and at the time of M. Favre\u2019s visit may have been between 50 and 60, with nearly white hair, looking old for his years; he probably deceived M. Favre by his ready acquiescence in the idea of his being 80 years old; like most of the natives here he was quite ready to agree to anything which might please his guest, and was quite disposed to say that he was 110. The Batin\u2019s hut lies not far from Bukit Telenteng and Pupur, which we were told Mr. Hill ascended in search of plants during the day he was kept waiting while his men were getting ready their \u201cambong.\u201d Mr. Hill gives the elevation at 1350 feet. The Dato told me there was no hill at the source of the Sayung, as stated by Favre and Logan, from the other side of which flowed the Benut into the straits of Malacca, he said that the streams flowed in opposite directions from the same swamp, but there must be some fall; the same might perhaps be assumed in the case of the two Semrongs asserted by Logan to be one river joining the Batu Pahat and the Endau further North, but in 1877 I was assured by Che Musa of Panchur, who had explored the Endau and its branches that this was not so, and that the two Semrongs were separated at the source by rising ground, so\nthat for the present at all events, Logan\u2019s assertion cannot be unreservedly accepted. There were plenty of subjects for conversation with the Dato; but I was obliged to reserve them for such opportunity as I might get on my return. After dinner our men told us some Malay tales, and we in return gave them Little Red Riding Hood and other stories, to which they listened with much interest and amusement, some of the incidents eliciting roars of laughter, the unexpectedly tragic fate, however, of little Red Riding Hood, according to our version, cast a shade over the audience who speedily retired to forget their grief in slumber. The next day (30th) we succeeded, contrary to our expectations, in getting our party off at 11.30 a.m. We were 16 in all, 12 men, besides ourselves and the boys. I had to give up my native mattress, there not being enough carriers; the Malays consider 15 to 20 kati sufficient load for a man in an \u201cambong\u201d (the basket they carry on the back with straps passing over the shoulders); Chinaman would carry much more in his two baskets on a kandar-stick, but they could not pass along a great portion of the path we had to travel, which was in many places only just wide enough for the head and shoulders to squeeze through. After starting we had to cross a stream by means of some unpleasantly ricketty branches; and then our course, there could be hardly said to be a path, lay through jungle which was all under water, sometimes up to the knees and occasionally deeper still, with muddy holes and invisible roots and stumps, so that our progress was not rapid. After an hour or two of this sort of work we came upon a larger stream with rushing current, a medium-sized tree stem lay across it, but some inches under the surface, and though the natives with their prehensile feet crossed it safely, we did not feel quite equal to the occasion, and our men soon had a few uprights stuck in the bed of the stream secured to each by horizontal bars, and so we got over. On the other side all was equally under water and we continued to wade, occasionally up to the middle, along the banks of this stream, which was the Lenggiu, till 3 p.m. or so, when we got on to higher ground, only now and again having a swamp or small stream to cross. By 4 p.m. we had reached still higher ground with a delightful clear sandy-bedded brook flowing at the foot of a steep rise; here, above the stream, we decided on taking up our quarters for the night, being told that Mr. Hill\u2019s first resting place could not be reached till after dark; one of our men moreover, who had been taken\nwith fever on the way, was now too bad to go any further. Our men now began, with greater energy than they had yet shewn in anything, some to make a clearing, others to cut down trees for their bark, and saplings for poles, and in about an hour we had a capital shanty two or three feet off the ground with a kajang roof (for we had brought two kajangs with us) and bark flooring (the bark of the meranti tree). This first day's work had completely destroyed my canvas shoes, and having only one other pair (fortunately leather however), with five or six days' tramping before me, I contemplated the future with some misgiving. After the persevering attacks of sand-flies had been dispelled by the smoke of a fire lit close to our hut, we at last got to sleep amid the croaks, cries, shrieks, and hootings of a host of frogs, insects, and birds. The stream below us was a tributary of the Penis, which we had crossed earlier in the day.\n\nNext day (31st) we made a start about 8 a.m. including the invalid of yesterday, whom I had dosed three times with quinine; this drug and sal volatile, which I had with others in a little case, was in great request among our men. At 10 a.m. we reached Hill's first resting-place, Ayer l'\u00fbtih, (white water), so called apparently on the l\u00e1cus a non lucendo principle. Yesterday the soil was muddy or sandy, now it was darker, and the swamps through which we passed between the higher levels of our course rejoiced in a deep brown mud, in which we sank now and then to over the knee. The rattan thorns were a constant annoyance, and the path even our Malays lost sometimes, but the Jakuns seemed never at fault and sped along, though somewhat more heavily burdened than the others, with astonishing rapidity. In the way of flora we observed some fine ferns and lycopodiums, and a variety of plants and creepers with beautifully marked leaves. About 3.30 p.m. we heard the sound of rushing water and shortly after reached the banks of a most delightful mountain torrent tearing down amongst granite boulders of all sizes and shapes; this we were told was B\u00fblu L\u00ebnggiu, or the source of the L\u00ebnggiu River, and on this spot was B\u00e2tu S\u00ebtinggan (the squatters' stone) or B\u00e2tu B\u00ebrkachang, to which a legend is attached that it was the first couch of the parents of the human race; the details of the legend cannot be stated here, so I simply follow the account of it given by Logan, who here first came upon the L\u00ebnggiu on his return from the trip up Endau as already referred to. Another of our party being down with fever,\nwe determined to camp here for the night, and so we soon had a hut put up on the very brink of the torrent. Meanwhile we had a delicious bath, after which we wandered up the stream and collected two or three uncommon ferns, one a very small ribbon like plant adhering to the rock by a thin film of root and soil, another was a foot high or so, with a delicate straight black stem, and a radiating crown of fine tapering leaves, also growing on the rock in the stream from a horizontally growing root. The bed of the torrent here is broken up granite, consisting mainly of quartz, with a little mica; the boulders differ somewhat in quality, some being rather sycintic, others more porphyritic in appearance; good large blocks of solid quartz were also found in the bed of the stream, some of them shewing the regular prisms of quartzy crystals. The soil on both banks was in some parts sandy, in others clayey, in others of a somewhat coarser texture occasionally shewing a lateritic tendency which gave it a gravelly appearance, but this was more noticeable further up the country.\n\nNext morning we continued our journey about 8 a.m., leaving two of our party behind, one of them to look after the man who had succumbed to fever the previous day. I gave the invalid a dose of quinine before starting, and left another for him to take if needed. The man who had broken down the first day had quite recovered. After two or three hours' work in ascending and descending a series of hills with sandy and rocky streams between them, we had a steep climb up a slippery hill of rather superior looking soil, and after going along a narrow ridge at the top we came to a dip; here we were brought to a halt, and were told that this was the old boundary line between Pahang and Johor, but that now it ran further North. Our path soon after descended and we very shortly had another steep climb up to a similar narrow ridge and in coming up with the leader were told they had just seen a tiger, or, as they more respectfully put it, a Dato, about 20 yards to their right who on seeing them made away down the slope; they now refused to go any further till the whole party had collected; I was particularly struck with the blanched faces of our boys at the mention of the Dato having been so near (\u0645\u0648\u0643\u0627\u0628). After this we were not long in coming to another halt for a more satisfactory purpose; we had reached a large square block of stone which projected from the side of the hill, and whence we had a fine view of B\u00each\u00fbak and\nBl\u00fbmut; B\u00eachuak with her twin peaks to the right, Bl\u00fbmut stretching away to the left, concealing behind her broad back Chimundong, the third of the trio. These three hold an important place in B\u00eanu\u00e2k legends (I found the name acknowledged by the Dato, who pronounced it as spelt, and talked of a \"R\u00e2ja B\u00eanu\u00e2k\" in old days.) As the result of my inquiries was to confirm the accuracy of Logan's account, I cannot do better than quote his account of the origin of the B\u00eanu\u00e2k country and race, and of the particular legend connected with Bl\u00fbmut. \"The ground on which \"we stand is not solid. It is merely the skin of the earth \"(k\u00fblit b\u00fbmi). In ancient times Perman [the \"Allah\" of \"the Benu\u00e2k] broke up this skin, so that the world was \"destroyed and overwhelmed with water. Afterwards he \"caused Gunong Lul\u00fbmut [Bl\u00fbmut] with Chimundong and \"B\u00eachuak to rise, and this low land which we inhabit was \"formed later. These mountainis in the South, and Gunong \"L\u00eadang (Mt. Ophir), Gunong Kap (Mount Kof, probably), \"Gunong Tongkat Bangsi, and Gunong Tongkat S\u00fbbang on \"the North, give a fixity to the earth's skin. The earth still \"depends entirely on these mountains for its steadiness. The \"Lul\u00fbmut mountains are the oldest land. The summit of \"Gunong Tongkat Bangsi is within one foot of the sky; that \"of Gunong Tongkat L\u00fbbang is within an ear-ring's length; \"and that of Gunong Kap is in contact with it. After Lul\u00fb- \"mut had emerged, a prahu of pulei wood covered over and \"without any opening floated on the waters. In this Pirman \"had enclosed a man and woman whom he had made. After \"the lapse of some time the prahu was neither directed with \"or against the current nor driven to and fro. The man and \"woman feeling it to rest motionless, nibbled their way \"through it, stood on the dry ground, and beheld this our \"world. At first, however, everything was obscure. There \"was neither morning nor evening because the sun had not \"yet been made. When it became light they saw seven \"sindudo* trees and seven plants of rumput sambau. They \"then said to each other, 'in what a condition are we, with- \"out children or grand-children.' Some time afterwards the \"woman became pregnant, and had two children, not, however, \"in her womb, but in the calves of her legs. From the \"right leg was brought forth a male, and the left a female \"child. Hence it is that the issue of the same womb can- \"not intermarry.\" All mankind are the descendants of the\n\n* Or sikud\u00fbduk, a common rhododendrum-like shrub.\ntwo children of the first pair. When men had much increased, Pirnam looked down upon them with pleasure and reckoned their numbers.\n\nThey look upon the Gunong Lulumut group with a superstitious reverence, not only connecting it with the dawn of human life, but regarding it as possessed of animation itself. Lulumut is the husband, Chimundong his old wife, and Bechuk his young one. At first they lived together in harmony, but one day Chimundong in a fit of jealousy cut off Bechuk's hair. The young wife retaliated by a kick applied with such force to Chimundong's head that it was forced out of its position. Lulumut, seeing his mistake, stepped in with his huge body between them, and has ever since kept them separated.\n\nSome way further on we came to a tree where the path bifurcated, on which we found the initials of Mr. Hill and Che Yahya bearing date 18-1-79, and an arrow pointing to the left as the path to be followed by the Blumut-bound traveller; our predecessors had been taken along the right hand path and ultimately found themselves on the top of Bechuk whence a still higher mountain was visible, so they retraced their steps and took the left-hand path down to the gorge, through which runs a stream flowing down from the dip between Blumut and Bechuk. Here they put up a hut and took up their quarters for the night, ascending to the top of Blumut the following morning. We took the left hand path, and found ourselves, after the descent of an almost perpendicular steep of rich black soil, on the edge of the stream just mentioned, with Mr. Hill's hut just facing us on the other side of it. This stream, which gurgles down through rocks clothed with ferns and caladiums, is the source of the Kahang, one of the tributaries of the Endau, and while our dinner was getting ready, we clambered up the rocks, and found besides ferns and caladiums, a small waxen-stemmed plant, thriving on the veryest minimum of soil, with the most beautiful leaves of a velvety brown-tinted green, their surface traversed by veins of purest gold; this plant, which seems to be an audictochilus of some kind, certainly carries off the palm from the silver, and the red and gold varieties. After turning in, we found the air very keen; and after a vain attempt to get to sleep in the usual amount of clothing, I was constrained to get up and don two or three additional layers of flannel, after which I contrived to pass the night in barely tolerable warmth; the wind was blowing boisterously up the gully and through our hut,\nso as to effectually clear out any little warmth created by our numbers, two hurricane lamps, and a fire on each side of the hut.\n\nAt 7 a.m. we found the thermometer in the hut shewing 67\u00b0. Outside, at 4 a.m., it must have been three or four degrees colder. We left for the ascent to the summit about 8 a.m., the path at first leading down a rather steep slope, but it soon began to ascend; and the soil grew black and slippery, and the trees slighter in bulk but thicker in number; they wore a thick coating of dripping moss which made their appearance very deceptive; a stem apparently as thick as a man's leg turning out to be no bigger than his wrist. After toiling and climbing and squeezing our way up for an hour or so, we reached the top of the ridge, where a furious wind was rushing by, hurrying along an unbroken succession of dense clouds; a little further on we came to an opening on the eastern side with grass and bushes; here we found two varieties of fern, very handsome, one I recognised, having met with it on Pinang Hill; and Mr. Hullett has seen it at Woodlands on the coast of the old Straits facing Johor Bh\u00e2ru; it is, I believe, the *Dipteris Horsfieldii*: the other, I think, must be the *Matenia Vectinata*. These two ferns are described by Wallace in his work on the Malay Archipelago as rare species he found on Mt. Ophir,\u2014the latter, he adds, being only found on that mountain. The ferns we saw exactly corresponded with the engraving which accompanies Wallace's account of them, but none we saw exceeded two feet or so in height, whereas Wallace describes those he met as reaching a height of seven or eight feet and growing in groves. These, however, were found growing close to the Padang Batu on Mount Ophir, probably a warmer and more sheltered spot, and the specimens we saw were likely to be dwarfed from their damp and bleak situation. We got several roots of both species, but I regret that none of them have come to anything. After another half an hour's absolute climbing, in which we had to make constant use of the bemoosed stems around us, we gained the summit, which is extremely narrow, hardly reaching 20 feet diameter anywhere; it consists of large blocks of granite, stunted trees, bushes, and the r\u00e2sau which I had noted with equal surprise on the top of Panti; it must be taken as an indication of dampness. Intent on getting a view, we climbed on to the top of some of the rocks, but the clouds continued to sweep unbroken over us, and so we proceeded to take observations below the roc\ninstead, and groped and slid about under them and the greasy black roots and soil between them with some success, finding a variety of ferns and damp plants; most of the moisture-loving ferns we found are, I think, to be met with on Pinang Hill, but I came across one variety which is very like a creeper\u2014the Malays call it \"b\u00e2ju-b\u00e2ju\"\u2014but which I had never seen or heard of before; there was a good deal of it in one or two places; it reaches about one foot in height and is very slight and delicate; it grows on a horizontal root with small fibrous tap-roots. We found a few orchids of the commoner sorts. We found also another growth which I have never seen before; at first, among the other foliage, it looked like some kind of pine or fir, such as grows on Pinang Hill, but on examination it proved to be a creeper; we did not find its root; we brought down a spray with us, which I have submitted to the inspection of Mr. Murton, the Superintendent of the Botanical Gardens.\n\nThe summit of this mountain is certainly a most extraordinary place, with its rocks and roots of trees so disposed in a continuous descent as to form a succession of steep and slippery caves, which constantly require climbing to get through, and where it is often difficult to get a footing. Native tradition has been wont to call this the house of the tiger race, but on the approach of the white man the race has been removed to the sister mountain of Chimundong, where it will doubtless remain till the invasion of some adventurous \"orang puteh\" drives it back to that other stronghold of the race Gunong Ledang (Mount Ophir). When on an expedition to Mentehak in 1877, I was informed that no one, not even a Jakun, had ever reached the summit of Blumut, Jakuns only passing over the lower points; the obstacle being tribes of huge and ferocious monkeys which rendered it dangerous, if not impossible, to attempt it. It is true that no Jakun had ever been to the top of this mountain, till one or two of them went with Mr. Hill a few days before us, but I regret to say that the monkeys were disappointingly timid and retiring; not one ventured within sight of us.\n\nHaving tied up our plants, we once more climbed on to the top of the rocks, and by 1 p.m. the clouds had all cleared away, and we had the satisfaction of a fine view in all directions; the horizon, however, never quite cleared, remaining hazy to the last, so that we did not succeed in making out\nMount Ophir as we had hoped to do. Immediately North of us lay Chimundong, a fine mountain, with two peaks some little way apart, little if at all inferior in elevation to Bl\u00fbmut; their bases touch. N. W. some 15 to 20 miles away, rose Gunong J\u00e2ning in Pahang territory. Directly South stand the twin peaks of B\u00each\u00fbak, while S.S.E of her run the parallel ridges of P\u00fbscl\u00e2ngan (the old boundary) and P\u00eaninjan. Somewhat hazy in the distance lay Gunong P\u00fblei, about S. S. E. Further to the East, about E. S. E., we noted Panti and M\u00ean-t\u00eahak with S\u00ebmbcl\u00e2yang between them, and Bukit or P\u00ean-\u00e2li Panjang (long ridge), Bukit B\u00fblang (moon hill), and Bukit Tambun Tulang (bone-heap hill) in the foreground. East of North numbers of smaller hills could be seen, and nearer East still other heights of considerable elevation could be dimly descried in the distance; no one could identify these, but I suspect them to have been Pulau Tioman and Pulau Aor. The greater part of the country from S. to W., as far as we could see, appeared to be an unbroken level of jungle, but the rest is a fine country abounding in hills of all heights up to 3,000 feet, with numerous streams following into the Johor, Endau and S\u00ebdili. The soil runs through all the changes, from black mould to red clay and sand. We got down from the top to our hut in time to collect a few plants from the rocky stream close to it.\n\nNext day, 3rd Feby., on reaching the Singgong stream, I collected a few pebbles of quartz, iron-tinted sand-stone, and various forms of granite; I also found a lump of what I take to be a form of specular iron ore affected by water; the sand in the stream contains small laminate prisms of mica. At Batu Setinggong, in the H\u00fblu L\u00ebnggiu, we collected the ferns and mineral specimens already described and reached the Ayer Putih (noted for its black mud), somewhat to our surprise, about 3.30 p. m.\n\nLeft next day about 8 a. m., (after a row between two of our men, which was nipped in the bud at the first blow,) and reached our resting place of the first day at 10 a. m., where we found the fever-stricken man and his friend, who had been left behind at Batu Setinggong, had made themselves a very snug corner in the hut. After collecting together here we set off again; and when we got to the lower ground, which had all been under water before and given us so much trouble, we found the water had entirely disappeared; so our progress was much quicker, and we\nreached P\u00ebngk\u00e2lan T\u00ebba at 1 p.m., thus accomplishing in 2 hours and 40 minutes a distance over which on the first day we had expended 4 hours and a half. I had some talk with the Dato about various legends; among others that of Bukit P\u00ebni\u00e2bong, said to be a practicable ascent within the day, there and back, from K\u00ebl\u00ebs\u00e2 B\u00e2niak. The legend is that a cock-fight took place between R\u00e2ja Ch\u00fblan and another R\u00e2ja of old times, the defeated bird flew away to his house at Bukit B\u00fblan, while the victorious bird was turned into stone and still remains a mute but faithful witness to mark the spot where the tremendous conflict took place. The Dato informed me that he had seen the figure himself on the top of Bukit P\u00ebni\u00e2bong; it was a good deal above life-size, he said, and just like a cock in white stone; he added that the top of the hill was bare and a good view was to be had from it. Assuming that he really did visit the hill, it seems to me not improbable that this hill may turn out to be lime-stone, the most southerly in the Peninsula; at present, I believe, there is no lime-stone known to exist South of the S\u00e9l\u00e1ngor caves described in a paper by Mr. Daly, which was read at a meeting of the Society not long ago. In the afternoon the B\u00e2t\u00eeu (nephew of the Dato and son of an old Jakun of our party), a young man, came in, after a successful chase, with a p\u00eblandok he had killed, and gave us a leg.\n\n5th. Had the p\u00eblandok leg at breakfast, and found it most excellent. I think it beats any kind of meat I ever ate; it is something between a hare and chicken in flavour. Had some talk with the B\u00e2t\u00eeu and the Dato about religion, the origin of the tiger race, and the camphor language. The legend of the tiger the Dato refused to communicate in public, and I had to go to a place apart before he would tell it me.\n\nIn their own house tigers are supposed to have the human shape, and only to assume the shape in which they are known when they go abroad. Their original abode is placed at Ch\u00ebn\u00e2ku in the interior of the M\u00ebnangk\u00e2bau country; when they increased and crossed to the Peninsula they took up quarters at Gunong L\u00ebdang and in the Bl\u00fbmut range. The legend of the origin of the tiger had better be related in the language in which it was told me, Malay. It is as follows:\n\n\"Pada zeman dah\u00fblu Baginda Ali R\u00e2ja yang p\u00ebrt\u00e2ma.\n\"Maka ad\u00e2lah pada su\u00e2tu hari ia t\u00fbrun kasungei handak mandi\n\"s\u00fbrta m\u00fbmb\u00fbat h\u00e2jatnya. Maka pada kotika itu, k\u00ebl\u00fbarlah\n\"sa-\u00eakor k\u00f4dok h\u00eejau deri sungei lalu dijilatiya k\u00ebpada\n\"Baginda Ali itu. Maka adalah b\u00ebbr\u00e2pa l\u00e2ma k\u00ebmdian deripa-\n\"da itu k\u00f4dok hijau itu m\u00eanjadi bunting, sambil b\u00earanak\n\"sa-\u00eakor harimau d\u00eangan sa-\u00eakor bu\u00e2ya.\n\nIn connection with the foregoing, the Dato communicated to me the following:\n\n\"K\u00e2lau ch\u00fbtek, k\u00e2lau chatei\n\"Sangkut d\u00e2han pauh\n\"Matahari j\u00eantei harimau t\u00fbha\n\"Jauh jangan d\u00eakat\n\"Aku tahu asal \u00eangkau\n\"M\u00fbla m\u00eanjadi, Fatimah n\u00e2ma\n\"Mak, nabi Musa n\u00e2ma b\u00e2pa.\n\"S\u00eagriching s\u00eagrichang p\u00e2tah\n\"Ranting digonggong angsa\n\"T\u00e2roh kunchi t\u00earkanching\n\"Maka kunchi nabi tidak t\u00ear\u00e2w\u00e2\n\"Tidak ternafsu t\u00earkanching\n\"Brat buangkan h\u00e2wa nafsu\n\"Aku tahui t\u00fbron t\u00eam\u00fbron \u00eangkau\n\"M\u00fbla m\u00eanjadi.\"\n\nWhich may be translated as follows: Even though they be\n\"withered, though they snap, may you be entangled in the\n\"boughs of the pauh tree till the sun falls old tiger, keep far\n\"away and approach not, I know the origin of your first\n\"being, Fatimah was your Mother's name and the prophet\n\"Moses your father's.\"\n\n[This appears to be a mistake, as Fatimah lived 1000 years after Moses, probably Baginda Ali should be substituted for Nabi Musa.]\n\n\"Snap snap go the twigs in the bill of the goose. Put on\n\"the lock and you are fastened up, once the lock of the\n\"prophet has been placed on you, no longer can you indulge\n\"your desires, you are fastened up, heavy is the restraint\n\"placed on your desires. I know your original descent.\"\n\nThe above s\u00ear\u00e1pah or charm is, it will be seen, for protection against the tiger.\n\nIt will be observed that these two legendary accounts of the origin of the tiger differ, the first tracing it to the frog, and that given in the s\u00ear\u00e1pah to Fatimah and Moses (or Baginda\nAli). The explanation appears to me to be that the first is the real original native tradition, modified by the substitution of Baginda Ali, a Mohomedan name, for that of the native prince who must originally have figured as the chief actor in the transaction; while the account given in the second betrays the influence of Mohammedanism, to suit which it was evidently written, or at all events modified like the first. The theory of the semi-human nature of the tiger race in its home at Ch\u00e9n\u00e2ku, the original tiger being born of a frog, may be accounted for by its human paternity. Perhaps the legend in representing the tiger as descended from man and frog\u2014the highest and one of the lowest of animals\u2014indicates the combination of great and base qualities which is found in the tiger; or the frog may be intended to point to the readiness with which he takes to the water; or, still more likely perhaps, the legend of his origin was framed after that of his dual nature, and to account for it.\n\nI made inquiries as to the camphor language in use by the aborigines and the Malays when in search of camphor. On this subject Logan makes the following remarks.\n\n\"While searching for it they abstain from certain kinds of food, eat a little earth, and use a kind of artificial language called the bah\u00e2sa k\u00e2pur (camphor language).\" [I found some difficulty in getting the words \"bah\u00e2sa k\u00e2pur\" understood; when my informants saw what I meant they exclaimed \"oh he means pantang k\u00e2pur.\"] \"This I found to be the same on the S\u00e9dili, the Endau and the B\u00e2tu Pahat. From the subjoined specimens it will be seen that most of the words are formed on the Malayan and in many cases by merely substituting for the common name one derived from some quality of the object, as 'grass fruit' for 'rice,' 'far-sounding' for 'gun,' 'short-legged' for 'hog,' 'leaves' for 'hair,' etc.\"\n\nThe Camphor Language.\n\n[I went through Logan's list, and as I had a good many words given me which do not appear in his list, and where the words are the same several being sounded otherwise than his spelling would indicate, I insert them here in a third column.]\n| English       |

D. DALY.\n\n(Read at a Meeting of the Society, held on 7th April, 1879.)\n\nA most interesting and important discovery of caves in the Native State of Selangor (near Kwala Lumpor) was made a few days ago by Mr. Syers, Superintendent of Police in that State. Whilst on a hunting excursion in search of elephants and other game, in company with an American naturalist, and wearily plodding their way through a dense tropical jungle, Mr. Syers was suddenly assailed by an unusual perfume, and on asking the Sakeis (wild men) who accompanied him and who were tracking an elephant, he was told that it arose from a large deposit of bat's manure in some caves hard by. Mr. Syers entered these caves, and a party having been made up to explore them, the following account by one of the explorers may not be uninteresting:\n\n\"The party consisted of Capt. B. Douglas, H. B. M.'s Resident of Selangor, Lieut. R. Lindsell of H. M.'s 28th Regt., Mr. Syers, Supt. of Police, the writer, some Orang Sakei, and some police.\n\n\"Leaving Klang at 8 a.m. in the steam-tender 'Abdul Samat' and following up the Klang river a distance of 17 miles, the rising township of Damansara was reached at 10 a.m., thence a good road for 13 miles on ponies, and four miles through jungle, brought the party to the great tin-mining centre at Kwala Lumpor.\n\n\"From Kwala Lumpor to the caves, along a jungle track, all over very good soil, chocolate-coloured loam, and passing through groves of numerous fruit trees, a ride of about nine miles in a northerly direction brought us to the foot of a lime stone hill, about 400 feet high, with steep perpendicular sides. The white clefts of the hill glistened in the sunlight and at once indicated limestone formation. Durian trees grow at the base of this hill and threw their lofty branches, laden with fruit at this season. Half way up the hill, and through the rich-soiled flat\nat the base runs a bubbling crystal streamlet over many-coloured quartz and blue and limestone pebbles, such as would gladden the heart of a trout-fisher to take a cast over.\n\nAfter reaching the hill we climbed about 50 feet over rocky boulders and stood opposite a large gateway, hollowed out of the limestone hill, a great cavern, looking black and ominous as we faced it, and the scent of the bat's manure was strong. This is called the \"Gua Lambong\" (or swinging or hanging cave), No. 1. Here the Sakeis and others commenced their notes of warning as to the deep holes in this cave, and the party entered with cautious steps. The writer tried hard to take up a modest retiring position in the rear, like Mark Twain when there were rumours of Arabs at the Pyramids of Egypt, but he found that other members were also anxious to show their humility in staying behind, some stopped to tuck up their trousers on account of the bat's manure, another walked very suddenly on one side and stopped and closely examined the nature of the limestone formation, and the worst case of timidity was of one who foremost at the start, suddenly wheeled round to the rear saying he wanted to light a cigar. However, having lighted torches the gallant representative of H. M.'s 28th Regiment took the lead and boldly advanced. After a few yards' walking on the soft elastic layer of the bat's manure, we had to throw away the damar torches, as the rosin from the damar that dropped on the manure set fire to it, and in their place long split bamboos were used for torches, which answered admirably.\n\nThe appearance of this cave was very grand. On a main bearing of N. N. W we walked for about a quarter of a mile over rocks and then gently over dry deposits of bat's manure, which were from 3 to 6 feet deep. The roof and sides of the caves, which were 50 to 70 feet high and some 60 feet wide, were beautifully arched, presenting the appearance of a great Gothic dome, with curved arches and giant buttresses. Verily there was a stillness and sublimity in this work of nature that even surpassed the awe of the holy place raised by human art.\n\nHanging from the conchoidal arches of this vaulted dome were thousands of bats, whose flitting fluttering noises resembled the surging of the sea on an iron-bound coast. Arriving at the end of the cave we came upon an opening in the limestone crust above, which shed a soft light over the scene, a subdued tinge over the green-crusted walls at the top and a\nsofter halo on the bright crystals of the stalactites. Carefully taking away specimens of the stalactites and stalagmites we wended our way back to the entrance, and only reached it as the torches were nearly finished.\n\nThere is a sort of alcove hollowed outside this entrance to the right hand by nature out of the rocks. A model cookhouse with its stoves, fire places and all that would be necessary for the most fastidious Eastern cook.\n\nIt seemed a pity to leave such a delightfully cool atmosphere for the heated exhalations without, but another attraction awaited us and a cry of \"Durians\" recalled us to the most solid comforts of this life. Quantities of durians grew on the trees at the base of this hill\u2014a sure sign of good soil in the Malay Peninsula\u2014and after having a good meal of this delicious fruit, after a quarter of an hour's walk in a northerly direction, we were led by Mr. Syers and the Sakei to No. 2 Cave called \"Gua Belah\" (or the divided cave.) This cave was much lower in height than the last, but contained very fantastical limestone formations. The bearing was N. N. E. through these caverns, for about 100 yards, but there were branches which might be explored if sufficient time allowed. Outside these two caves were very original drawings made by the Sakei with charcoal on the limestone walls, reminding us of our first efforts at making sketches of the human form.\n\nNo. 3 Cave, \"Gua Lada\" (Pepper cave) called from the numerous chili trees growing near the entrance, is reached after another half a mile in a northerly direction.\n\nThis and No. 2 Caves are both entered from the base of the hill, no climbing required like \"Gua Lambong\" (No. 1). This is planned in one vault running S. S. E., 90 yards long, with two side corridors at right angles on either side, and the crystalline deposits are more perfect than in No. 1 Cave. Here the limestone columns have joined the stalactites, and the stalagmites are more perfect. In some places, there are great pulpits overhung with canopies, whose brilliant crystalline fringes sparkle again in the garish glare of the torches, inducing the visitor again to think of this as a great church of nature. Here, fantastically carved out of the rock, may be seen imitation umbrellas and couches and baths partly filled with bright waters that have dropped through the limestone ceiling.\nIt is strange that fossils could not be found anywhere. Nothing but thousands of tons of bat's dung\u2014itself a great fortune in guano.\n\nFrom the absence of fossils or shells it would appear that the sea never reached any part of this hill.\n\nThere are seven different entrances to this hill, and a few wild cattle, the \"Seladang,\" roaming about here; but there are large herds of cattle at \"Batang Kali,\" near Ulu Selangor. Wild elephants are plentiful, and Durians, Pelasan, Rambutan, Rambei, Mangostin and other large fruit trees grow plentifully in the rich soil surrounding this limestone hill, in the midst of the most luxurious jungle vegetation.\nGEOGRAPHY OF ACHIN.\n\nTRANSLATED FOR THE SOCIETY BY DR. BIEBER.\n\n[The following notes on the Geography of the North-western part of Sumatra are taken from a paper by Mr. T. C. R. Westpalm van Hoorn tot Burgh, published a short time ago in the \"Tijdschrift van het aardrijkskundig genootschap te Amsterdam.\"]\n\nAchin lies between $95^\\circ 13'$ and $98^\\circ 17'$ East Longitude and between $2^\\circ 48'$ and $5^\\circ 40'$ North Latitude.\n\nThe statements as to the extent of this territory, current up to the present time, differ materially from each other. Melvill van Carnbee calculates it at 924, Anderson at 1,200, Dijserink at 960, and Veth at 900 square miles.\n\nAlong the West coast an uninterrupted chain of mountains extends, known by the name of Pedir Daholi; it is a continuation of those mountains called the Bockit Barissan, which extend to the Vlakken Hock, the Western point of South-eastern Sumatra. These high mountains, which from North-west to South-east run right through Sumatra, divide Achin into two parts, the one sloping downwards to the West coast and the other to the East coast.\n\nAs in those parts of Sumatra, which have already been subjected to Dutch rule, so also in Achin the mountains are of a volcanic nature; they are based on a foundation of trachyte, while in the upper layers granite, porphyry, limestone and sandstone come to the surface.\n\nThe low coast lands, called by the natives \"darat\" or \"rantau,\" are here and there broken by low chains of hills, but for the greater part they are swampy and covered with dense woods. From Cape Diamond to the Tamiang river on the East coast alluvial soil is to be found, and here the mouths of the rivers are continually changing, and the coast is intersected\nwith innumerable creeks. In this way the whole Eastern part of the North coast, as far as the promontory of Batoe Padir, presents itself as a broad flat range of coast land, while the Western part of the North coast bears the mountainous character common to the whole West coast of Sumatra.\n\nIn the chain of mountains lie the following as yet scarcely known Volcanoes:\u2014 Not far from the North coast under $5^\\circ 26' 30''$ North Latitude and $95^\\circ 41' 30''$ East Longitude is situated the Goenong Yah Moerah, otherwise called the Glawa, Lawa, Salawa and known also as the Goud or Koninginneberg. This mountain is 2,300 meters high and wooded to the top. More to the East and extending in an easterly direction under $5^\\circ 10'$ North Latitude lie the Samalanga mountains. In the South-western province Alas, close to the Batta Districts, we find the Goenong Batoe Gapit. Besides these volcanoes the following mountains are named in the paper. Eastward of the Gund or Koninginneberg or Goenong Pedir or Weesberg already mentioned, eastward also of Goenong Samalanga the Goenong Poedadah or Oliphantsberg, the Goenong Bangallang and the mountains South of Pasangan. South-east of these mountains is the crater Bockit Tjoenda in the province Tjoenda, and in the province Gedong there is the Bockit Pasei, a long level mountain-ridge without a single prominent peak, which may be considered as a continuation of the Samalanga mountains, a range which probably terminates in the Bockit Tocmian. Further in the interior rise the Abong-abong and in a South-easterly direction the Goenong Loese. Close to the West coast at the port of Kloeaang there are the Bockit Tembaga or Koperheuvel, the Boekit Koeali at Ranoe North of Rigas Bay and South-west the Goenong Tampat Toeau.\n\nAlong a considerable part of the West coast the mountains slope down to the shore, and in some cases rise from it very abruptly and are interrupted by parallel coast rivers. Only in those parts lying more to the South-east, between the coast river Assahan and the place called Troemon, the mountains recede, and then not more than $\\frac{1}{4}$ to $1\\frac{1}{2}$ miles from the coast.\n\nThese narrow ranges of shore covered with rich woods of alders where the Settlements are situated, are very interesting in comparison with the steep densely wooded mountains.\nThe rivers, taking their rise on the two principal chains, and having but a short course and a steep descent, are of little importance. Where there are no shoals, mud banks, or breakers, such as are frequently found on the West coast, to obstruct the mouths of the rivers, most of them offer a good anchorage for vessels of small draught.\n\nAs one of the most important rivers, we have to name the Achin on the North-western point of Sumatra, which takes its rise on the slopes of the Gouliberg. Its depth is from 6 meters to 12 meters and its breadth 100 meters, but its mouth is closed by a bar through which there is a passage, sometimes obstructed, but with a fair wind it can be passed by sloops and launches. The Lambosi or Lamboes, Oenga, Panzah, Wailah, Sinagum, Trang, Toca, Soesoe, Manging, Labocan Hadjii, and finally the Bakoengan close to the territory of Troemon are the more important rivers on the West coast.\n\nThe following rivers disembogue on the North and East coast, viz.: the Kroeng Irijah, East of Pedropunt; the Pedir and the Gighen (both flowing into the Pedir Bay), the Tje or Ajer Laboe, Sawan Samalanga (1\u00bd miles West of Oedjong Raja, a mountain river, very broad at its mouth); the Djimb Pedada, Djambo, Djoebi, Pasagan, Pasei (30 meters broad but only 1 meter in depth at its mouth, while further up its depth is 55 meters). The rivers Belong, Pindjong, Lindjoeng and Koqua disemboguing East of Cape Agum-agum empty themselves into the sea at the same point. Two and a half miles further West of Diamond Promontory is the Kerty and then the Tjankoi, Pidada, Legabatang, and Djamboe Ajer or Zoetwater-river at Diamond Cape, which forms the boundary of Kerti and Simpang Olim.\n\nFurther East there are the mouths of the rivers Mentoei and Bekas, Rocsah, Ringin and Belas, Arakoendoer, Djollok or Djoelok, Boeging, Bagan and Edi, which are all connected with each other and form but one creek. These rivers, under favorable circumstances, are navigable even for schooners as soon as they have passed the bars. Then follow the Padawa Ketjil, Padawa Besar, Sembilan, Perlakh, Toeli Besar Lagoe, Raja, Baja Birim, Temboes, Pasir Poetih Rowan, Laugsar, Radjatoea Besar, and Tamiang, the latter forming the boundary between Achin and Siak.\nThe most important *Promontories* in the extreme North-west, west of the Achin river, are: Nadjid, Raja or Koeningspunt and Masamoeka. Then follow on the West coast the Capes Sedoe or Siddoh, Dawai, Baroes or Rigas in the Rigas Bay, Aroen, Batoe Toetoeng and Tsjellung, Boeboen, Malaboe, Taripoh, Raja or Felix, Margging, Toean, and Mankies. On the East coast, East of the Achin river, we find the capes Aroe or Pedropunt, Batoe Putih, Segi or Sagi, Merdoe, Radja, Pasangan, Djamboe Ajer or Diamantpunt, Perlakh, and Tamiaug.\n\n[In the spelling of the Native Names it has not been attempted to follow the \"Straits\" system; The Dutch method has been left untouched.]\nACCOUNT OF A NATURALIST'S VISIT TO THE TERRITORY OF SEL\u00c0NGOR.\n\nBy Wm. T. Hornaday.\n\n(Read at a Meeting of the Society, held on the 7th of April, 1879.)\n\nWishing to obtain a glimpse of the Zoology of the Malay Peninsula, and also to collect as many specimens of Mammals as possible, I determined to make a flying visit to the territory of Sel\u00e0ngor. Since that country has been but recently opened up to Europeans and is thinly inhabited as yet, I expected to find it a good field for collecting, and so it proved. Leaving Singapore on June 2nd, 1878, twenty-six hours' steaming brought us to the mouth of the river Klang, about 200 miles from our starting point. This is the largest river in the territory, and is about 150 yards wide near the mouth.\n\nFor about 12 miles up the river the banks are low and swampy, covered to the water's edge with the usual growth of mangrove and nipa palm; and then we arrive at the town of Klang, the capital of the territory, situated on the first high ground. The fort is perched up on a hill overlooking the town, and on a higher hill a little farther back\u2014as if to keep an eye over all\u2014is the British Residency.\n\nI was very kindly received by Her Majesty's Resident, Captain Douglas, and during my entire stay in Klang I was very hospitably entertained by H. C. Syers, Esquire, Superintendent of Police.\n\nI soon found there were no large or specially valuable animals to be obtained in the immediate vicinity of Klang, so I engaged a boat to take me down the river and up the coast a few miles by sea to a Malay village called Jerom, which is about one mile from the mouth of the Sungei Bulu, a little river fairly swarming with crocodiles. Here I lived twelve days in the house of Datu Puteh, and devoted all my energies\nto crocodiles. I shot five with my rifle, and five more were caught for me by Malays and Chinamen by means of the well-known rattan and bark-rope, with a stick tied in the middle cross-wise at the end of the rope and sharpened at both ends. The largest crocodile I obtained (crocodilus porosus) was 12 feet in length and weighed 415 pounds. Two others were 11 feet, and another 10\u00bd feet in length, and of the ten specimens I prepared 4 skeletons, 4 skins, and 1 skull.\n\nAlong this part of the coast the shore is very low, and near the shore the sea is very shallow. For many years the sea has been gradually eating away the shore-line, and undermining the cocoanut trees which grow close along the beach, until now the beach is thickly strewn with fallen trunks. At ebb tide the water recedes from the beach and leaves bare a great mud flat, nearly a mile wide, which is so soft and miry that it is almost impossible to effect a landing from the sea at that time.\n\nBack from the beach for an unknown number of miles extends a swampy wilderness inhabited at present only by wild beasts. Along the banks of the Sungei Bulu, I saw where the high grass had been trampled down quite recently by what must have been a large herd of wild elephants, and I was told by the natives that wild cattle were plentiful in some parts of the adjacent forest.\n\nWhile at Jerom I made daily trips to the Sungei Bulu for crocodiles and whatever else I could find on the mud flats at the mouth, which were always several feet above water when the tide was out. In this vicinity I noticed a goodly number of water-birds, notably a few pelicans, two species of ibis, a small white egret, the stone plover, a booby, two terns, snipe, sandpiper, &c. I often saw troops of the common kra (macacus cynomolgus) wading about in the mud under the mangroves, looking for food, and I easily shot several specimens. We once surprised a fine kra zaya (hydrooannes salvator, found also in Ceylon) on one of the mud banks, and my boy immediately jumped out of the boat and gave chase. The mud came quite to his knees and his progress was necessarily slow, but the iguana fared even worse, and after an exciting chase of about 100 yards (time about 20 minutes!) the reptile was overhauled and killed with a stick. It was a fine large specimen, measuring 6 feet 2 inches.\nAt the mouth of the Sungei Bulu there is a temporary Chinese village inhabited by about forty Chinamen engaged in catching prawns on the flats and making them into *blachang*. The village is dirty beyond description, and smells even worse, if possible, than the market for dried fish in Singapore.\n\nWhile at Jerom, a fine otter (*lutra leptonyx?*) was brought to me by a Malay, and a Chinese fisherman caught a spiny-backed ray (*urogymnus asperimus*), the largest specimen I ever saw of that species; the body measuring 3 feet in length. I noticed a number of old skins of the same ray lying about the village, all of which were of large size, so it seems this species must be quite common on this coast.\n\nAfter spending a fortnight at Jerom very profitably I returned to Klang and prepared to make a trip into the interior in quest of large mammals. To my intense satisfaction, Mr. Syers obtained fourteen days' leave of absence and prepared to accompany me. Our main object was to find rhinoceros, and, if possible, kill one or two for their skins and skeletons.\n\nWe left Klang on the evening of June 26th, and proceeded up the river 18 miles by boat to Damasara, arriving there the same night. Early the next morning we set out for Kwala Lumpor, a large town 17 miles to the East of Damasara, in the centre of the tin-mining district. A good carriage road is being constructed from Damasara to Kwala Lumpor, but at that time was completed for only about 12 miles, so that the remainder of the journey, which lay through dense forest and over very uneven and hilly ground, our baggage had to be carried by coolies. Fortunately for us, Captain Douglas had very kindly arranged that our baggage should be carried by Government coolies, or we should have been entirely at the mercy of the natives, who would probably have charged us 15 to 20 cents per *kati* for the trip, as they often do. The road, now nearly completed, will undoubtedly be of the greatest importance both in developing the adjacent country and insuring the preservation of order. The Malays of the interior can no longer feel secure from the Klang Government, because of the former difficulty of conducting military operations against them, for, in my opinion, the making of good roads is the subjugation of Malays. The Damasara road is cut through the densest high forest I have seen in this part of the world, the trees being, as a rule, very lofty, of good diameter, and standing thickly together. The undergrowth is also very dense, com-\nposed mostly of huge thorny ferns, and the soil is undoubtedly rich. Usually the ground is high and hilly, so that swamps are the exception and not the rule.\n\nWe passed through a number of old clearings, some of which had been abandoned almost as soon as completed. It is evident that as an agriculturist, the Malay is not a success, nor does he seem to succeed even passably at it. It seems to me that those clearings should by all means be kept well in hand, and not allowed to grow up again into worse jungle than before.\n\nFrom Kwala Lumpor we went on six miles farther to the North, to a village called Batu, on the river Batu, which falls into the river Klang; which is here a mere creek. We stayed at this place seven days, and hunted through the jungle in every direction for several miles. Finding that wild elephants were plentiful, we determined to bring down one for the sake of its skeleton. The second day out, we struck a fresh trail early in the morning and followed it diligently for some hours. We had two Jakuns as trackers, and were also accompanied by two policemen. The trail led us a merry-go-round through swamps of tall grass, through comfortably open forest, through tangled and thorny jungle that would have been very nearly impassable to us but for the broad trail left by the herd. At last, about 2 p.m., after two hours' wading through mud and water of various depths, we came up with the herd in the middle of a forest-covered swamp. We could not possibly have been led into worse ground. However, there was no help for it, so Mr. Syers and I undertook to stalk the herd, while each of our followers promptly swarmed up a tree. The herd consisted of eight or ten elephants, but there was no tusker to be seen. They were quietly browsing off the tufts of grass which grew here and there, or breaking down branches for their favourite leaves. We selected our victim, the largest male in sight, and began cautiously working our way up to him. We had to climb over several rotten tree-trunks and piles of dead branches, to go through mud and water up to our knees, and it seemed to me scarcely possible to get within proper range without being discovered. But we persevered, and at last fetched up behind the root of a fallen tree within fifteen paces of our elephant, who was standing broadside on. Just as we raised our rifles, he stooped his head almost down to the ground, but we quietly waited until he raised it again, and then at the word our rifles rang out exactly together. The elephant sank down\nwhere he stood, then struggled to rise again, when we both fired again, and one ball took effect in his brain. He gave a tremendous shudder, settled down where he stood with his back up and his legs all doubled under him, and in a couple of minutes was quite dead.\n\nHe was a male specimen with tusks only, and not quite full grown. His back was completely encrusted with a hard cake of dry mud to protect him from the swarm of huge flies that constantly followed him. Being amply provided with knives and whetstones, we set to work on the spot to cut out the skeleton, and the following day mustered a gang of coolies who carried the bones out of the jungle to our quarters at Batu.\n\nElephants are plentiful throughout at Selangor territory, and particularly so in the Kwala Lumpor district. They often do great damage to the paddy-fields and gardens, and occasionally an old rogue pulls down a Malay house. It is my opinion that it will soon be found necessary for the Government to offer a reward for dead elephants in Selangor, or they will become a great nuisance to the native agriculturists. It is not likely that elephants will ever be caught and trained to service in that territory, and hence the quicker they cease to be a dreaded nuisance the better.\n\nWe were at Batu in the durian season, and often visited the trees in the forest when the Malays were collecting the fruit as fast as it fell. Like the Jakuns, they build little huts high up against the trees, usually 15 or 20 feet from the ground, to get out of the way of wild beasts. But the rascally elephants often take the trouble to pull down even those high platforms and frighten the inhabitants half out of their wits. The herd to which we paid our respects had just the night before visited several durian camps and had torn down the highest platform of all, as if to show the Malays that it was of no use trying to build a hut out of their reach. Of course the Malays fled to the jungle. There are several large caves in the vicinity, and the Jakuns are in the habit of taking refuge in them when the elephants become too neighbourly.\n\nWild cattle (*bos sondaicus*) are common in the densest jungle near Batu, and on one occasion Mr. Syers caught a glimpse of one individual, but was unable to get a shot. We often saw their sperm, and spent some time in hunting for them, but did not succeed in bringing off a specimen. The inevitable kra (*macacus cynomolgus*) was often seen; and squirrels were also plentiful; we obtained 4 species. Rhinoceros horn-\nbills (*B. rhinoceros*) were frequently seen, and we obtained one good specimen. The Malays and Jakuns brought us many specimens of the beautiful little mouse deer (*tragulus*), 2 species, and several small *felidae* which they had caught in traps.\n\nAfter remaining a week at Batu, wherein we devoted our entire time to collecting mammals, we packed up our elephant skeleton and other specimens, and sent them down to Klang by the river, while we returned to Kwala Lumpor. We visited one of the tin mines, and the Captain China very kindly gave me a pikul of specimen tin ore of various qualities from several different mines. He also entertained us very hospitably indeed, and showed us every courtesy and kindness. We then returned to Damasara, and just as we were taking the boat to go down to Klang, we were somewhat startled at hearing the clear musical trumpet-note of an elephant in the jungle close to the police station. Elephant-hunting in Selangor can never be anything else than the hardest of hard work, owing to the density of the jungles and the depth of the mud and water through which every elephant trail is sure to lead. For the same reason it is unusually dangerous also.\n\nAt the end of the six weeks I packed up a goodly collection, consisting of the skins and skeletons of mammals and crocodiles, reptiles and fishes in spirits, rocks, minerals, &c., and took my departure for Singapore, highly gratified with what I had seen and accomplished, and with the kind and hospitable treatment I had received from all the European Officers of the Government.\n\nIt is beyond the scope of these notes to attempt giving even an outline of the general Natural History of Selangor and I shall confine myself to that branch to which I paid particular attention, viz., Mammals. Since my visit to that country, my friend Mr. Syers has collected and sent me a goodly number of mammals, of which several species are new in my Selangor collection. I present herewith a list of such species as I have now in that collection, and I also include certain others of which I have seen either skins or live animals in Selangor. To my certain knowledge the species enumerated below are found, having been either \"collected\" or \"observed.\" Of course there are many other mammals which could have been met with in a longer stay, and will, in due time, be added by other observers to the following list.\n### Partial List of Mammals of Selangor\n\n| Name | Collected or Observed | Remarks |\n|------|-----------------------|---------|\n| Hylobates lar | ... | (Wah-wah) | Collected.

It has not yet been thoroughly explored, but the preliminary labours of a professional Surveyor (Mr. H. S. Deane), have already contributed something to our knowledge of this district. A separate Note to be found at p. 135 will contain a portion of Mr. Deane's report upon the Plus and the country in which it rises.\n\nFrom Selangor some interesting information has been received respecting three routes across the range which separates that State from Pahang. Two are described on native authority in the following passages; the third, Sungei Tata, forms the subject of a separate note by the same contributor.\n\n*Sungei Roh.*\u2014\u201cD\u00e1tu Manku came in from Pahang; he was \u201cthree days from Sungei Roh, a river leading into Pahang \u201cabout a mile from Ulu Pahang; he describes the country \u201cas being very rich, abounding in camphor *burus*, gold, tin, \u201cgutta and other products. He states it to be his opinion \u201cthat if Europeans collected the revenue, it would yield $80,000 \u201ca month. Kwala Pahang he states to be 15 days from Sungei \u201cRoh, and he adds that in passing over the dividing range of \u201chills the sea is visible to the S. W.\u201d\n\n*Ulu Bernam.*\u2014\u201cH\u00e1ji Mustapha informs me that it will take \u201cfour days and four nights to cross to Pahang. The first \u201cKampong in Pahang is *Sumpam* where there are ten houses, \u201cthe people working *ladangs*. He says that the water-sheds \u201cor sources of the Pahang and Bernam are only divided by a \u201cmere strip of land, a yard in breadth.\n\n\u201cThe D\u00e1tu Bakar, the headman of *Ulu Pahany*, lives \u201cabout six hours by boat from the source of the Pahang; rafts \u201care first used, and then as the stream enlarges sampans.\u201d\n\"The H\u00e1ji states it takes 21 days to go from the source to the Kwala in an ordinary sized boat.\n\n\"This information, I think, may be depended on, as H\u00e1ji Mustapha is a Pahang man.\n\n\"He thinks any European going down the river should be provided with a pass from the D\u00e1tu B\u00e9ndahara, but Malays would not be molested.\n\n\"Tim, gold, and camphor abound, the country being very rich. Horses are not known in Pahang.\"\n\nIn Johor a point of some difficulty has been settled in regard to the union of the two rivers Semrona,\u2014that which flows East into the Batu Pahat, and that which flows West into the Indau. Mr. Hervey devoted a month to exploring up to the source of the latter, and ascertained that these and other streamlets intermingle with the utmost intricacy at the fountain head, whence they slowly diverge into opposite directions. He eventually returned by Maelay's route via Ulu Madek and across the water shed to Ulu Teba (R. Johor) by a short way to the East of Blumut.\n\nA M. S.\n\n\"Sungei Tata\" Route.\n\nA number of Menangkabau men were met at Ulu Klang. All these people with the exception of Manatah, tried to dissuade me from attempting to reach Sungai Tata, the locality where the Lampongs are. They said the only road was up the face of an almost inaccessible mountain\u2014the granite range seen from Ulu Klang. It certainly looked stiff, but I simply told them \"where Malays can go, we can,\" although I was an old man (a fact they repeatedly reminded me of). I said I should hold the enquiry at Sungei Tata, and see for myself. Kim Li, whom I had sent up previously, stated there was much oppression going on, but that the Menangkabau men, were so packed and influential, it was very difficult to get at the truth. So at 10 we started, and I found the road much better than I expected; it was steep enough, but not so bad as the track over Bukit Balachang, the dividing range between Ampang and Ulu Langat.\n\nBy 12.45 we reached Bukit Lulu, a steep rocky crest almost bare, with stunted trees. The aneroid gave 1,500 feet above Kwala Lumpor. I got some useful bearings for the survey. Jugra hill stood out very distinct from the lowland\non the coast and bore S. W. $\\frac{3}{4}$ W.; the right tangent of the town of Kwala Lumpor S. W. $\\frac{1}{4}$ S. I saw the glint of the sea, and had it been clear, I could have made out several known points.\n\nThe view was a very fine one; the high mountain range between Selangor and Pahang to the N. E. with the valley of the Klang at our feet South-westward, was magnificent.\n\nTo the westward there was a higher rocky summit, probably 150 feet higher, distant above 200 yards from this. A better view could be obtained and I intend to use it in the survey. I gave directions to have it cleared and whitened about 12 feet down, the lime can be procured from the Batu caves. Looking down from our post of observation it seemed all plain sailing to reach Sungei Tata, but we found this the worst part of our journey. We first halted in a gully, 500 feet below the higher station; and then had a very laborious walk of $2\\frac{1}{2}$ hours over the spurs of the range, rising and falling 200 or 300 feet, reaching Sungei Tata and a little Kampong of some half a dozen small houses and a mining baksal on a small rise above the little stream at 3.40 p.m. The aneroid gave this as 380 feet above Kwala Lumpor. Here we stopped, and of course, I had a mild chaff with our Menangkabu friends; they said I was old, but Kuat jalan. We deferred business discussions until the morrow. We bathed in the stream, then had a medicine meeting; every one had some real or fancied ailment, and I soon emptied the bottle of chlorodyne in my small medicine chest. I noticed two men whose faces were much swollen, the ears and eyes being nearly closed, yellowish pimples on the skin, and the features much distorted. The men were charcoal-burners and stated they had worked at cutting down the Rangas trees, the gum or sap falling on them thus affected them; they said it would go off in three days; they did not complain of much pain, but they had a wonderfully bunged-up look. The night was deliciously cool, and not the hum of a mosquito was to be heard; sand flies were not. However fatiguing the hill route was, it was better than the lower track, part of which was in the bed of Sungei Tata and then by the valley of the Klang the track crossing and recrossing the Klang 1$\\frac{1}{3}$ times, the river swollen and reaching up to the waist, the stream so strong that one had great difficulty in keeping his footing. Near the junction of the Klang and Tata, we came on the track to Pahang. About four miles below the Kampong at Sungei Tata we reached a hot spring flowing\nout of a basin in a small granite rock, about 2 or 3 feet above the bed of a small branch or back-water of the Klang on its left bank. The water is impregnated with sulphur, and hot enough to cook an egg or rice in; we found it too hot to test by hand. On approaching, steam is seen rising a considerable height among the trees. A short distance below are two other springs, the lowest being the coolest and oozing out of the mud. Here wild cattle, \"Seladang\" and other large game came down to wallow in the hot ground, and, so the natives say, to drink the mineral water. The natives themselves bathe in the water and use it as an internal medicine for rheumatism, with, they say, good effect. I had no detached thermometer to test the temperature of the springs, but I should say, the hottest one was about 180 to 180 degrees; there was some ebullition as of boiling.\n\nB. D.\n\nSurvey Report on Uul Perak, by Mr. H. S. Deane.\n\n[The Government has courteously placed at the Society's disposal the following extract from the Survey Report of Mr. H. S. Deane, who has been engaged for some time in a preliminary survey of the interior of Perak on behalf of the Government of that State.]\n\nWhile in Kinta I visited and spent several days on the summit of Gunong Bujang Malacca at an elevation of 3,800 feet above sea level.\n\nFrom here I obtained a magnificent view of the main or back-bone range, along that section of it in which the Kinta Chendriang Kampar Batang Paduang, and Bidor rivers take their rise.\n\nHere also I secured satisfactory bearings, together with angles of elevation and depth on all prominent points along this section of the main range, and on the principal peaks of the Slim mountains, which are situated at the extreme South-East corner of the State, and attain a considerable height, probably not less than 6,000 to 7,000 feet above sea level.\nThe Slim Mountains immediately adjoin the river of that name, as also the Bernam river.\n\nFrom Bujang Malacca, bearings were also procured on the Dinding, Pangkor, Bubo, Hijau, and other important ranges.\n\nOn the return journey from Kinta I left the usual track at a place called Chumor, and taking a north-easterly course reached a Sakei village called Kampong Langkor situated on the Sungei Kerbau (a tributary of the Plus) and which takes its rise on the north-western slopes of Gunong Riam, &c.\n\nNo European having previously visited this locality, I had some difficulty in inducing the villagers to accompany me in search of a good sight point.\n\nAt last they agreed, and I might have had the \"whole village,\" the only stipulation they made being that I should not lead them beyond a certain point, marking limit of their acquaintance with the range.\n\nOn the morning of the second day, and after ascending and descending several ridges, we were fortunate in finding a summit which will form a most useful trigonometrical station.\n\nThis mountain is known as Gunong Asal and when clear (I observed from the top of a high tree) will command observations on the Gunong Riam, Laam, Malacca Miru, Bubo, Pondok, Sayong, Hijau, Biong, Inas,\u2014in fact the whole of the Titi Bangsa range on the extreme northern boundary, and a magnificent view of the back-bone range forming the East limit of Perak to North of Gunong Riam already referred to at Gunong Bujang Malacca.\n\nGunong Asal overlooks the Ulu Plus Valley, which extends in a north-westerly direction from this summit for 6 to 12 miles into the Plus Valley, and immediately adjoining Gunong Asal there is a continuous and elevated group of parallelled ranges which rise to an elevation of from 1,000 to 3,500 feet above sea level, and which incline in a North by West direction from the eastern spur of the Asal range.\nGunong Asal bears almost due East from Gunong Pondok and is distant from it about 38 miles in a direct line.\n\nReturning to Kampong Langkor I followed the Sungai Kerbau to its junction with the Plus river, which latter I went up as far as it was navigable for boats of light draught.\n\nThe Plus is a very fine river, and although several of the rapids* are tedious, the river can be much improved, should there be sufficient traffic on it to justify the expenditure of a few hundred pounds sterling.\n\nFrom all I heard and personally saw I feel convinced that the Plus Valley generally is exceedingly rich in Tin deposit. Certainly the soil on Gunong Asal is very superior and well adapted to Coffee-growing, while in the valley it is no less so for most low country products.\n\nI must have been some 50 miles up the Plus river at the rapid\u2020 above referred to, and from what I saw in a short walk along the bank still further up I think it quite possible that had I lifted the boat over the rapid (not a very bad one) I might have gone much further up, as the river seemed broad and deep for a considerable distance.\n\nReturning to Ku\u00e2la Kangsa via Plus and Perak river I proceeded to Thaiping.\n\nBefore starting for the interior again I tooked the necessary levels for a proposed tramway from Telok Kertang to the market place at Thaiping. The information so recorded will be sufficient for all working plans and estimates, but I will have to extend the section and forward particulars from Ceylon hereafter.\n\nMy next journey through the State commenced at Thaiping and took me across the upper waters of the Kurau, Hijau, and other rivers to Ku\u00e2la Selama.\n\nFrom Ku\u00e2la Selama I ascended the Selama river by boat, proceeding as far as it was navigable for small craft,\n\n*Notably Jeram Dina where I turned.\n\u2020Jeram Dina.\nand from this point visited Gunong Inas one of the most southerly points of the Titi Bangsa range which forms the extreme northern limit of the State of Perak.\n\nGunong Inas, at least the particular summit ascended by me, stands rather over 5,000 feet above sea level, but the section of this group of mountains which more particularly mark the North limit of the State, rise to an elevation of more than 6,000 feet in some parts probably almost 7,000 feet above sea level, and is known as Titi Bangal.\n\nThe weather proving cloudy it was not until after remaining several days on Inas summit that I obtained a complete arc of horizontal and vertical angles. Inas observes all the ranges I have hitherto enumerated (with the exception of those in Kinta and in the South-east of that district), right round the circle to the Titi Bangsa summits close at hand, and on which would be placed the extreme northern station in this series of triangulation.\n\nOn descending Inas I next proceeded in a northerly direction to the Krian river, and taking boat from the highest point to which the river can be navigated, followed its course to the boundary of Province Wellesley at Parit Buntar and from there went to Thaiping via Penang.\n\nBefore leaving Penang I visited the signal station on the hill there, and obtained reciprocal observations on Gunong Inas station, which I erected before leaving that hill and which was distinctly visible although situated at a distance of some 45 miles from the flagstaff.\n\nThe completion of Mr. Low's programme next took me to Durian Sebatang. Before leaving this place I observed from Bukit Tunggal near Kampong Gajah in that locality, and secured bearings on Pulau Sembilan Islands, mouth of Perak river near Pangkor, the Dindings, and other ranges.\n\nThe country near and to South-east of Durian Sebatang is not so well adapted to triangulation; nevertheless the system can be extended here also when necessary.\nHereafter I visited the Bernam river (the southern limit of the State) and went up as far as Simpang\u2014the end of the deeper portion of the river and where poles take place of oars for navigation further up stream.\n\nOn the Bernam I steamed up as far as Kampong Chankat Berhitam* a distance I put down at not less than 76 miles. Taking boat at Berhitam I went up 7 to 9 miles further and found soundings to be 10 to 17 feet as far as Simpang, where the river divides and shallows.\n\nA Tiger's Wake.\n\n[The following extract from the Diary of the Resident Officer at Langat describes the superstitious feelings of Malays, common among other orientals also, towards the Tiger.]\n\n\"At 10 A.M. a great noise of rejoicing with drums and gongs approaching Jugra by the river was heard, and on my questioning the people, I was told Raja Yakob had managed to shoot a Jugra with a spring gun, behind Tiger hill, and was bringing it in state to the Sultan. I went over to the Sultan's at Raja Yakob's request, to see the attendants on the slaughter of a Tiger. The animal was supported by posts and fastened in an attitude as nearly as possible approaching the living. Its mouth was forced open, its tongue allowed to droop on one side, and a small rattan attached to its upper jaw was passed over a pole held by a man behind. This finished, two swords were produced and placed crosswise, and a couple of Panglimas selected for the dance; the gongs and drums were beaten at quick time, the man holding the rattan attached to the tiger's head pulled it, moving the head up and down, and the two Panglimas, after making their obeisance to the Sultan rushed at the swords and, holding them in their hands commenced a most wild and exciting dance. They spun around on one leg, waving their swords, then bounded forward and made a thrust at the tiger; moving back quickly with the point of the weapon facing the animal; they crawled along the ground and sprung over it uttering\n\n* From the Kuala Bernam.\n\"defiant yells, they cut and parried at supposed attacks,\nfinally throwing down their weapon and taunting the dead\nbeast by dancing before it unarmed. This done Inas told\nme the carcase was at my disposal.\n\n\"The death of this tiger now establishes the fact of the\nexistence of tigers here, for asserting which I have been\npretty frequently laughed at. However, this is not the Ju-\ngra pest, a brute whose death would be matter for general\nrejoicing, the one now destroyed being a tigress 8 feet long\nand 2 feet 8 inches high.\"\n\n---\n\n**Breeding Pearls.**\n\n[The following paragraphs respecting \"Breeding Pearls,\" extracted from *Land and Water* under the dates annexed to them, may be of interest.]\n\nThe glass tube now before me, so kindly provided by Her Highness the Ranee of Sarawak as a test of the credulity of the inhabitants of the British Isles, contains a few genuine seed pearls of the Meleagrina and five small marine shells\u2014Cowries or Cyprea, sub-genus Trivia of Gray, which represent the rice. The specific distinctions of these small trivia are so minute that this individual species has been from time to time variously described. It is the Cyprea oryza of Linneus and of Lamarck; C. intermedia of Kiener; C. insecta of Mighels, and will doubtless receive other designations from daring conchologists, who delight in a religious dissent from the opinions of their predecessors. The so-called rice is a marine shell of the genus Cyprea, the end or apex of each example carefully filed or ground off to represent the effect of having been fed upon by the pearls. The whole is a deliberate and barefaced imposture, and it is to be hoped that when some generations hence this miserable myth again crops up in the repetitive operations of history, some more powerful pen than mine may find employment in denouncing the shameless attempt to impose upon the credulity of the scientific world.\n\n(Signed) Hugh Owen.\n\nDecember 25, 1878.\nTwo or three months ago I saw mention made of them by Major MacNair, R. E., in his work \"Perak and the Malays,\" and some years ago a work on Borneo, Sarawak, &c. made an especial allusion to them. But both authors spoke of the thing rather as a myth. It would be truly worthy work for you and a small council of your friends and brother savants to solve this mystery. Procure another batch of these pearls which are known to experts by their general appearance; lock them up (when in council assembled) for six months or so, and at the end of that term reveal to the public whether the pearls have increased.\n\n(Signed) Frank Buckland.\n\nNovember 16, 1878.\n\nPearls are composed of aggregated minute crystals of carbonate of lime. But we are apparently stumped at the outset, for crystals can only grow in solution, and the conditions in which pearls breed are, \"that they be kept in a dry box.\" However, we must make the best of things as they are. There is always water present in the air as aqueous vapour, varying in quantity according to circumstances; and the extreme limit of that quantity is determined by the temperature. Carbonic acid is also a constant constituent of the air, the normal amount being about 0.4 per cent. by volume; and there are always solid particles of organic and inorganic matter, varying in quantity and quality according to obvious conditions. We are told that it is necessary for the production of new pearls that nutritive material be provided in the shape of grains of rice. Rice like the grains of all cereals, contains lime, chiefly as the phosphate, and to some extent also as the carbonate. As pearls are composed of carbonate of lime it is probable that these earthy salts are the source from which the young ones are formed. As a confirmation of this I may mention that the old book previously alluded to states the Japanese use not rice, but a cheek-varnish prepared from a particular kind of shell. The preference of rice to other grains may be explained by the fact that it is the chief support of the inhabitants of warm countries where breeding pearls are found, and hence is most easily obtained. In the neighbourhood of chalk cliffs or limestone rocks, from the triturating effects of atmospheric agencies, both chemical and physical, the dust floating in the atmosphere is largely composed of carbonate of lime in an excessively fine state of division. It is just possible that similar\ncauses may operate on the lime salts of the rice included with the breeding pearls, and that so the air may become charged with an infinitesimal quantity of lime dust. During the day the temperature of the air is higher than at night, the range being greatest in tropical latitudes. As before remarked, the quantity of aqueous vapour capable of being held in suspension by the atmosphere varies with the temperature. At 32 degrees Fahrenheit it is about 2 grains to the cubic foot; at 77 degrees Fahrenheit, 10 grains; at 100 degrees Fahrenheit it is about 20 grains. Should the temperature during the night fall below the point of saturation for the vapour contained in the air, the latter is condensed into liquid globules, and dew begins to fall, carrying with it in its descent the floating dust particles. In such a case, within the box containing the pearl there will fall a fine moisture and lime dust, and the pearl will receive its share, becoming coated with a delicate film. Sometimes no such deposit will take place, and sometimes it will be more appreciable than at others, according to the amount of vapour with which the air is charged and the variation in the temperature. During the night the moisture, together with the carbonic acid of the air, will act on the lime particles, dissolving them. Those of the carbonate of lime will enter into solution as the bicarbonate, in exactly the same way as water passing over a calcareous soil acquires the property known as hardness. The phosphate will be partially decomposed by the carbonic acid, and also become dissolved as the bicarbonate. Hence ultimately the pearl is covered with an exceedingly weak solution of the bicarbonate of lime. Next day, with returning heat, the moisture evaporates, the carbonic acid is given off, and carbonate of lime is precipitated in a manner exactly analogous to the way in which stalactites are formed, except, that in the latter the deposit is amorphous, while on the pearl the molecules are induced by the pre-existing crystals to assume a definite polar arrangement which results in crystallisation. The effect of all this would be that a uniform or nearly uniform deposit would take place over the whole of the pearl. But suppose that on its surface there should happen to be a slight irregularity, such as might be caused by the projecting angle of any crystal, the moisture, according to the laws of the surface-tension of a fluid, will run together, and cling around the prominence. (This is simply illustrated by spilling a little water on a plate, and introducing a pellet into its midst, when the water will be seen to be heaped up round the pellet.\nHence, when the moisture evaporates, a greater deposit will take place at this spot than any other part of the pearl, and the irregularity will be gradually increased. In process of time a nodule will appear, formed of minute crystals grouped in a spherical form, which is the figure of the equilibrium that any aggregate of unite tends to assume under the influence of mutual attraction, and supported on a slender pedicle. As the sphericle increases in size, the force of gravity overcomes the cohesion of the pedicle, and a little pearl lies alongside the old one. Consecutive deposits will continue to be made on its surface, causing it to grow gradually larger. But as the surface of a sphere only increases as the square of its diameter, while the mass increases by the cube, the growth of the pearl will be most rapid when it is small, and the additions made to its bulk more imperceptible the larger it gets. And so we are told it takes three years for a new pearl to be formed, but forty years for it to attain \"the size that jewellers generally set, three in a ring.\" Such an hypothesis must be taken for what it is worth. My object is not so much to offer a solution of the problem, as to indicate that, through the operation of natural causes, of which, possibly, science is ignorant, it may be that pearls proliferate in the manner that is alleged.\n\n(Sd.) W. M.\n\n4th January, 1879.\n\nThe Maritime Code and Sir S. Raffles.\n\n(See Paper at page 52.)\n\nIn the Weekly Register, a newspaper formerly published in Malacca, there appeared in the year 1840, a translation of the Malay Code, with some remarks on Malay Codes, and on the aboriginal tribes of the Peninsula, and with translations of two Malay Manuscripts, one regarding the Menangkabau in Johor, the other relating to the first arrival of the Portuguese in Malacca.\n\nThis Series of papers was begun on the 9th January, 1840, and was completed on the 3rd September of the same year.\n\nThe name of the translator is not given, but the paper is described as \"an original fragment of an unpublished manuscript.\"\nIn 1877, Mr. Hervey having extracted it from the \"Weekly Register\", had a few copies of the Maritime Code printed for private distribution. Mr. W. E. Maxwell, who obtained a copy, was struck by the internal evidence and by some remarks of Newbold pointing to Sir Stamford Raffles as being the true though unacknowledged author of this paper; and communicated to the Society his reasons for thinking so in a short Memorandum. It was shortly after ascertained that Mr. Maxwell's suspicions were correct, and that Sir Stamford Raffles had in fact communicated this paper to the \"Asiatic Researches\" in 1809.\n\nThe question, however, still remains: how came the editor of the \"Weekly Register\" to be ignorant of this? there can be little doubt that he published the paper from M.S.S. for it is full of errors which would be otherwise unaccountable.\n\nBut how did he come across the M. S. S.? Possibly they were left by Raffles with some friend in Malacca, and after changing hands were ultimately made use of by the Editor of the Weekly Register. In Raffles' Memoirs by his widow, ed. 1830, extracts are given of the paper as it appeared in the \"Researches,\" and a comparison of these with the Code as re-printed in the Malacca paper, shews that in places the latter is the more full of the two, which suggests the inference that it was printed from the original and unrevised M. S. S. of the author. It would be interesting to discover these if they are still extant in Malacca.\n\nThe errors in the Code as it appears in the Weekly Register, are numerous, and many of them important. The bulk of these have been corrected in the present re-print by Mr. Maxwell and Mr. Hervey, who have also appended a few explanatory Notes. The \"Maritime Code\" alone is in this Number, the \"Remarks\" being reserved for the next.\nRainfall registered at the undermentioned Stations, in the Straits Settlements and the Native States, during the Half-year ending 30th June, 1879.\n\n|                | STRAITS SETTLEMENTS. | NATIVE STATES. |\n|----------------|----------------------|----------------|\n|                | Province Wellesley   | Sungei Ujong   |\n|                | Singapore            | The Residency  |\n|                | Malacca              | The Hill Plantation |\n|                | Penang               | Linggi         |\n|                | Butterworth          | Selangor, Klang |\n|                | Bertam               | Kuala Kangsa   |\n|                | Bukit Mertajam       | Thaipeng       |\n|                | Batu Kawan           | Matang         |\n|                |                      | Kinta          |\n|                | inches               | inches         |\n| January        | 19.18                | 7.58           |\n| February       | 9.14                 | 6.22           |\n| March          | 9.18                 | 4.22           |\n| April          | 6.61                 | 10.98          |\n| May            | 10.86                | 9.50           |\n| June           | 7.07                 | 2.88           |\n\n(Signed) T.

Skinner, Esq., (Honorary Secretary,)\nJas. Miller, Esq., (Honorary Treasurer,)\nD. F. A. Hervey, Esq.\nR. W. Hullett, Esq., M.A.\nG. A. Rem\u00e9, Esq.\n\nbesides\n\nMEMBERS AND VISITORS.\n\nThe Minutes of the last Meeting are read and confirmed.\n\nThe following gentlemen, recommended by the Council, are elected Members:\n\nThe Hon'ble S. Gilfillan.\nThe Hon'ble E. E. Isemonger.\nC. Stringer, Esq.\n\nThe President explains to the Council, that four months have been allowed to elapse since the last General Meeting, owing to the absence from the Society of several of the most active Members of the Council.\n\nThe President also states that action has been taken by the Council upon several matters of importance, some reference to which will be of interest to the Society.\n\n1. A reprint of the standard Malay work *Hikayat Abdullah* has been undertaken by the Society, with the assistance of the Education Department.\n2. The vocabulary of words selected, to assist in the collection of dialects of wild tribes, has now been issued, some delay having been caused by a very careful consideration of the list of representative words, and by the labour of translating them (through Dr. Bieber's assistance) into French, German, Dutch, and Spanish\u2014the European languages of most service in reference to the purposes of the Society.\n\nCopies of the vocabulary have already been circulated among those resident in the Native States, Sumatra, and Sarawak, and communicated to the learned Societies of neighbouring Colonies.\n\n3. The new map, to be published with the aid of Government under the auspices of this Society, is now ready for printing, and will be sent home by the next mail.\n\n4. Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner & Co., of London, and Messrs. Leroux & Co., of Paris, have written to request that they may be the recognised Agents of the Society in London and Paris, respectively, for the sale of the Journal, and the Council has acceded to their request.\n\nA paper upon the Kiuta District of P\u00earak, by Mr. H. W. C. Leech, is then read by the Secretary.\n\nAn account of certain Sakei Visitors to P\u00earak, by Mr. W. E. Maxwell, is read by the President.\n\nAn account of his ascent of the Johor River and G\u00fbnong Bl\u00fbmut is read by Mr. D. F. A. Hervey.\n\nThe Secretary makes a statement to the Society respecting the Journal (No. III.), the printing of which will, it is hoped, be completed shortly, so as to ensure its publication before the close of the month.\nANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\n\nHELD AT THE RAFFLES LIBRARY AT 8.30 P.M.,\nON FRIDAY, THE 30TH JANUARY, 1880.\n\nPRESENT.\n\nThe Venerable Archdeacon G. F. Hose, M.A., (President.)\nA. M. Skinner, Esq., (Honorary Secretary.)\nEdwin Koek, Esq., (Honorary Treasurer.)\nN. B. Dennys, Esq., Ph. D.\nG. A. Rem\u00e9, Esq.\n\nbesides\n\nMEMBERS AND VISITORS.\n\nThe Minutes of the last Meeting are read and confirmed.\n\nThe following gentlemen, recommended by the Council, are elected Members:\u2014\n\nL. H. Woods, Esq., (Malacca.)\nM. Schaalpe, Esq., (Rhio.)\nP. Nuy, Esq., (Singapore.)\n\nOn the proposal of Mr. G. A. Rem\u00e9, seconded by Dr. Dennys, H. H. The Maharaja of Johor is elected an Honorary Member of the Society.\n\nThe Secretary reads the Council's Report. The Treasurer reads the Council's Financial Account for 1879. It is proposed, seconded, and adopted, that the Reports be printed.\n\nThe President addresses the Society, and concludes by resigning, on behalf of himself and the other Officers and Councillors, the offices they have held during 1879.\n\nThe Officers and Councillors for 1880 are ballotted for, Messrs. Dennys and Koek kindly undertaking to act as Scrutineers of the ballot. Before balloting for the new Officers, the President states\nto the Meeting that it is the wish of himself and all the present office-bearers that the election about to take place should be made without any regard to the present holders of office, who are themselves particularly desirous to see new names on the roll of the Society's Officers.\n\nThe election of Officers then proceeds, and the following are declared to have been elected for 1880:\n\nPresident.\u2014The Venerable Archdeacon G. F. Hose, M.A.\nVice-President (Singapore).\u2014The Hon'ble Cecil C. Smith.\nVice-President (Penang).\u2014The Hon'ble C. J. Irving.\nHonorary Secretary.\u2014F. A. Swettenham, Esq.\nHonorary Treasurer.\u2014Edwin Koek, Esq.\n\nMembers.\n\nN. B. Dennys, Esq., Ph. D.; R. W. Hullett, Esq., M.A.; W. A. Pickering, Esq.; G. A. Kem\u00e9, Esq.; A. M. Skinner, Esq.\n\nA vote of thanks is passed to the outgoing Officers.\n\nA paper is read by Mr. E. W. Birch on the Vernacular Press of the Straits. After some remarks from Dr. Dennys, regarding the establishment of a Chinese Newspaper, the meeting separates.\n\n---\n\nThe Council's Annual Report for 1879.\n\nThe Straits Asiatic Society has now completed the second year of its existence; and notwithstanding some difficulties inseparable from its position, its work has been carried on during the year 1879 in accordance with the original programme.\n\nThere were last year eight applications to become Members, and eleven resignations.\n\nThe Society on the 1st January, 1880, comprised:\n\nThe Patron.\u2014An office which His Excellency the Administrator, Major-General Anson, C.M.G., was pleased to accept last May.\n\n4 Honorary Members.\u2014The Raja of Sarawak, Baron Maclay, Revds. L'Abb\u00e9s J. Faive and J. Perham.\n10 Officers and Members of the Council.\n\n139 Ordinary Members.\n\nThe Officers and Members of the Council, whose Report is now before the Society, were elected, as laid down in Rule 18, at the Annual General Meeting held on the 13th January, 1879. In April Dr. Bieber, one of the Council, left for Europe, and the remaining Officers of the Council elected Mr. Rem\u00e9, under Rule 10, to the place left vacant in the Council. In November the departure of Mr. Hervey caused another vacancy, which has not been filled.\n\nThe Treasurer, Mr. J. Miller, being temporarily absent, the duties of his office were, at the close of the year, kindly undertaken by Mr. Koek, who presents the Financial Account for 1879 to this Meeting.\n\nThe objects of the Society, as originally defined, are:\n\n(a.) The investigation of subjects connected with the Straits of Malacca and the neighbouring countries.\n\n(b.) The publication of papers in a Journal.\n\n(c.) The formation of a library of books bearing on the objects of the Society.\n\nNumbers 2 and 3 of our series of Journals, have been issued in the course of the year\u2014No. 2 in April and No. 3 in November.\n\nNineteen \"Papers\" and sixteen \"Miscellaneous Notices\" on various subjects, as defined above, have appeared altogether. The difficulties, already referred to as being inseparable from the position of the Society, are particularly felt in connection with the printing of these Papers and Journals; and it is to these difficulties alone, and not to the want of contributions, that any delay in the appearance of the Journal is to be attributed.\n\nThe subjects investigated comprise, amongst other topics, original accounts of the:\n\n1. Sakeis in the Interior of the Peninsula.\n2. Sakeis in Perak.\n3. Semangs in Kedah.\n4. Macrodontism.\n5. Selangor Mammals.\n6. Limestone in Ulu Klang.\n7. Gutta Percha.\n8. Chinese Secret Societies in the Straits Settlements.\n9. Malay Proverbs.\n10. M.S. of Sir Stamford Raffles (unpublished) on the Founding of Singapore, a reprint of his Malay Code.\n11. Disquisitions respecting the Ophiophagus Elaps, and \"Breeding Pearls.\"\n12. Geographical Notes regarding the routes from Pahang to Ulu Kelantau overland: from Selangor to Pahang by Ulu Bernam and Sungai Tata; across Rambau; up Gunong Blumut and the Semrong; and a Survey Report upon the River Plus and the interior of Perak.\n\nThere are in all 26 different writers enrolled among the Contributors of these papers.\n\nFor the selling and distributing of the Journal in Europe, Agents have, on their own application, been appointed as follows:\n\nLondon, Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner & Co.\nParis, Messrs. Leroux & Co.\n\nWith the permission of the Committee of the Raffles Library, our Meetings have, as hitherto, been held in their premises, excepting only on the occasion of the extraordinary Meeting in honour of Professor Nordenskjold, when the Society was kindly invited to assemble in the Singapore Club. The General Meetings have been less numerous than last year, as it was found convenient to hold them not monthly, but once in two months. This refers only to the General Meetings, the Council having continued to meet monthly as provided in the Rules.\n\nSix General Meetings were held in the course of the year, at which eight Papers were read, most of which either have appeared already, or will be published in the Journal (No. IV.), which is now in the printers' hands.\n\nAmong the interesting events of our Society's Meeting should be recorded that, to which reference has just been made\u2014the occasion on which the Society presented an address of congratulation to the explorers of the North-East passage, who recently visited this port in the \"Vega.\" An account of the proceedings on that\noccasion, our President's Address, and Professor Nordenskjold's reply are appended to this Report. Our Council felt that they would be carrying out the wishes of Members in seizing an opportunity afforded them to acknowledge cordially the devotion to a scientific course of which Professor Nordenskjold's career offers so eminent an example.\n\nThe Library is gradually increasing, through the exchanges with other Societies, and occasional gifts of works suitable to its shelves, and it now numbers 135 volumes.\n\nThe Society may also congratulate itself upon having taken an active part in urging upon Government the importance of purchasing the late Mr. Logan's Philological Library, both to assist students and to prevent the disposal of this unique collection. The Government has since completed the purchase; and the collection is now safely bestowed and available to all in the Raffles Library.\n\nThe Map of the Malay Peninsula, regarding the expenses of which we have also appealed to Government for assistance, is now in the hands of Messrs. Stanford & Co., of Charing Cross, and will, it is hoped, before long be in the hands of Members. Some delay was occasioned in endeavouring to correct and reconcile in the Survey Office certain \"bearings\" of newly discovered mountain peaks; and also in copying the chart before sending it home\u2014assistance which deserves acknowledgment. It cannot be too clearly explained that of the Peninsula, as a whole, this is in truth the first Map, and that if by a Map is understood something correct and complete, then it will not be one at all; nor would it be for such a Society as ours merely to be publishers of information already well known. But this tracing, with its larger size and more numerous names, will be of most service when it induces those who travel to furnish corrections and additions, wherever our knowledge of the country extends. Probably not one tenth part of the Peninsula has, even at the present time, been traversed by Europeans, and it becomes clear from the Geographical Notes, printed in each successive Journal, that if the Peninsula's Geography is ever to be really known, explorations are required on a more comprehensive scale than can be looked for in the occasional journals of district officers.\n\nThe publication of a larger tracing is, in the meantime, a step in the right direction, and for the means of publishing it, we are largely indebted to the Governments of the Native States.\n\nThe Vocabulary of words selected to assist in collecting the Dialects of Wild Tribes has been published, and circulated to the\nnumber of 50 copies, and a great many remain in our Clerk's hands in this Library, entirely at the disposal of all, whether members or not, who are willing to assist in forming a collection which will be unique, useful and peculiarly appropriate to the geographical position which Singapore occupies.\n\nAfter the list of 100 representative words had been settled, it was translated into German, French, Dutch, and Spanish, in the hope of extending the collection of these dialects over as wide a portion of Malaya as possible.\n\nEleven dialects have already been collected from the following tribes:\n\n1. Ulu Kinta,\n2. Chindariong,\n3. Kenering,\n4. Balau Dyak.\n5. Land Dyak.\n6. Samoi.\n7. Ulu Achin.\n8. Pulo Nias.\n9. Kayan.\n10. Punan Malano.\n11. Brabetan.\n\nA comparative list will be published in an early number of the Journal; and it is hoped that the dialects of the Sakei or Mintra tribes in Selangor and Sungei Ujong may then be added to the list.\n\nThus in reviewing the five matters referred to in the last Annual Report, it will be seen that three have been, at any rate, in an advanced stage during the past year. There remain:\n\nthe publication of a New Dictionary;\nthe indexing of Mr. Logan's Journals.\n\nThese have still to be undertaken, though some beginning has been made in the Index; and possibly, through the labours of a Member resident at Malacca, in commencing the new edition of a Dictionary. For the due support of the latter work it is to be feared our present means will prove inadequate; and both these undertakings are of that kind which demands no small share of leisure, a commodity in which most of us are poor indeed.\n\nAnother undertaking has been the reprint of the standard Malay work \"Hikayat Abdullah,\" part of which, it will be remembered, was recently published by Messrs. Henry S. King & Co., translated into English by Mr. Thomson. The Malay work was no longer obtainable, large sums having been offered for a copy in vain. An advantageous offer having been made to the Society, the whole work (437 pages) has been published under Contract for $400. It is satisfactory to be able to add, that the volume is already completed, and that the outlay upon its publication has been recovered, with the exception of some $50 to $60.\nThere is but one other point to notice; acknowledgment is due to Government for remitting, to the benefit of our Society, all local postage on its letters\u2014MSS. and Journals. As it is important this benefit should be known to all Members and contributors, the communication from Government on the subject is here recorded:\n\n\"Colonial Secretary's Office,\nSingapore, 21st January, 1880.\n\n\"Sir,\u2014In answer to your letter of 24th December last, with reference to reducing the payment for Postage on books dispatched to the other Settlements, I am directed by the Administrator to inform you that His Excellency has great pleasure in thus assisting the Straits Asiatic Society, and has directed that all publications, sent out by the Society to the other Settlements, with the signature of the Secretary, will pass without charge by all local steamers between the Straits Settlements and Native States.\n\n\"Instructions to this effect have been issued to the Post Office.\n\n\"I have the honour to be,\n\n\"Sir,\n\n\"Your most obedient Servant,\n\n(Signed) \"CECIL C. SMITH,\nColonial Secretary,\nStraits Settlements.\"\n\n\"The Honorary Secretary\nof the Straits Branch\nof the Royal Asiatic Society,\nSingapore.\"\n\nTreasurer's Report.\n\nAt the last Annual General Meeting of the Society, held on the 13th of January, 1879, there was a balance in the hands of the Treasurer to the amount of $309.52, and the amount of Subscriptions for 1878 then outstanding was $72, and the liabilities of the Society at that date amounted to $47.60 for bills outstanding.\n\nEight of the Subscriptions for 1878 have been paid, and the four are now considered as withdrawn, under Rule 6.\nThe List of Members of the Society, handed to the Treasurer for the collection of the Subscriptions, included 153 names, exclusive of those four Honorary Members, but of these, eleven members have resigned in the beginning of 1879, and four later on, four are considered to have resigned under Rule 6, and, it is with feelings of deep regret, I have to inform you of the death of one of our Members, Mr. P. E. Pistorius, who died in November last. The number of the subscribing members being thus reduced to 137.\n\nOf the eleven members who have resigned, only the four who resigned a few months ago have paid their subscriptions.\n\nOn the 31st December last, 106, out of the 148 subscriptions had been paid, and, with the exception of two which may be considered as withdrawn, the whole of the remaining subscriptions are likely to be paid.\n\nWith reference to the outstanding subscriptions for 1879, I may state that almost all the Members are residing abroad, hence the delay of collecting the debts.\n\nBy the abstract of the Cash accounts of the year, which I now lay before the Society, it will be seen that the receipts amounted to $1,299.52, and the payments to $695.75. The transactions resulting in a balance to the credit of the Society of $603.77. The subscriptions for 1879 to be received in 1880 amount to $186; and there were Bills for 1879 outstanding at the end of the year amounting to $672.58.\n\nThe general result is shewn by the Statement of Assets and Liabilities, from which it will be seen that the net balance to the credit of the Society at the close of the year was $117.19.\n\nIt was felt by the Council of the Society that a good opportunity offered itself to reprint a standard work like the \"Hikayat Abdullah.\"\n\nBut to enable the Society to do the work an advance had to be made of \u00a398, and on its completion a further sum of $202 was paid. For this $300 the Society have recouped themselves by the sale of copies, amounting to $300 in value, to the Education Department.\n\nIn addition to this, some $40 or so has been realised by private sales of the work, but against this there is a sum of $100, due to the Contractor for the work, and the Society is therefore some $60 out of pocket on this account, which will be probably made up by further sales.\nFrom the sale of the Journals of the Society I believe a sum of $36 has been recovered, but accounts have not as yet been rendered by the Agents of the Society.\n\nEdwin Koek,\nHonorary Treasurer.\n\nSingapore, 30th January, 1880.\n\nSTRAITS ASIATIC SOCIETY.\n\nCash Account, 1879.\n\nBalance of last account brought forward, ... $309 52\nSubscriptions for 1878, ... ... 48 00\nDo. 1879, ... ... 636 00\nSale of Journals, ... ... ... 6 00\nSale of \"Hikayat Abdullah,\" ... ... 300 00\n\n$1,299 52\n\nPublication of Journal, ... ... $340 80\nPhotographs, ... ... 35 60\nLithographs, ... ... 36 00\nPrinting \"Hikayat Abdullah,\" ... ... 98 00\nAdvertisements, ... ... 3 00\nAllowance to Clerk and Collector, ... ... 128 00\nPostage, &c., ... ... 27 84\nStationery, ... ... 50\nMiscellaneous, ... ... 26 01\n\n$695 75\n\nBalance, ... ... ... $603 77\n\n$1,299 52\n\nAssets and Liabilities,\n\n1st January, 1880.\n\nAssets.\n\nBalance in hand, ... ... ... $603 77\nSubscriptions, 1879, outstanding, ... 186 00\n\n$789 77\nLiabilities.\n\nBills outstanding, Postage, Clerk's Salary,\nStationery, &c., ... ... $24 48\nMission Press for Cartridge paper, &c., ... 40 10\nPrinting \"Hikayat Abdullah,\" ... 302 00\nPublication of Journal No. 3, about ... 300 00\nSubscription of Mr. Vermont for 1880 in advance, ... ... 6 00\n\n$672 58\nBalance to credit, ... ... 117 19\n\n$789 77\n\nEdwin Koek,\nHonorary Treasurer.\n\nThe President's Address.\n\nGentlemen, I shall not trespass upon your time and attention for more than a very few minutes this evening. I would not consent to the proposal that an Address from the President should be announced as part of the programme for this meeting, for I felt doubtful whether I had anything to say, and sure that the very few words I might desire to speak would not deserve to be called an Address. But I find I cannot make up my mind to retire from the honourable position which your kindness entrusted to me for the second time a year ago, without a last word. You have heard the history of the past year, and the present financial position of the Society in the reports just read by the Secretary and the Treasurer. They give us reason, I think, to be satisfied with the work already done, and to hope that there is a future for our Society which is full of promise. The fact that three numbers of the Journal, all containing most valuable contributions to the general knowledge of this part of the world in which we live, and the races inhabiting it, have been already produced, and that a fourth number is in progress, shews very plainly that such a Society as ours was wanted in the Straits. Seeing how much information has come in since the creation of a proper organization for receiving and recording it makes one reflect with pain and regret upon the number of possible contributors to the special branches of knowledge the Society seeks to advance who have passed away \"mute and inglorious\" for the lack of such an organization. And from the same cause, I doubt not, much valuable matter which had been\nalready committed to writing has been put aside as useless, carried away to other lands, or has perished by mischance or carelessness. Of one such case at least I know. Some papers which were the result of the learning and experience of one of the most able of the older residents, the Hon'ble Thomas Bradell, intended for publication in Logan's \"Journal of the Indian Archipelago,\" were lost after the valuable publication ceased to exist. And another series of papers from the same pen were entrusted to the editor of the short-lived \"Journal of Eastern Asia,\" and met with the same fate as their predecessors.\n\nThe failure and the loss were due in both cases to the same cause. The whole enterprise was on the shoulders of a single individual, and a want of leisure, or of health, or of perseverance on his part, brought the whole thing to an end. We have a hope, as I said on the first occasion I had the honour of addressing this Society, that we may escape the danger, by the fact that we are a Society, and therefore that, when one man fails or drops away, another will be found to fill up his place in the ranks, and the work will go on.\n\nI do not propose to review in detail the articles contributed to the pages of the Journal during the past year. I will only say of them that they seem to shew no sign of falling off, either in ability, or in permanent value.\n\nIt is very satisfactory that a Library has been commenced. The number of works in it is not large at present, and they consist, perhaps too exclusively, of the transactions of Societies like our own. But some progress has been made, and it has become recognised that the formation of a collection of books bearing upon our special subjects is one of the departments of the work we have undertaken to do.\n\nNo doubt one reason of the slow advance we have made in this direction is to be found in the proximity of the Raffles Library, which has lately been enriched by the Logan collection. But the list of scientific books upon the countries and the peoples of Malaya now on the shelves of the Raffles Library is by no means complete, and is perhaps unlikely to be made so, as a more popular style of literature is much more in demand. I do not doubt that in the future, the student of our special subjects will have to depend upon our Society for most of the books he may want to refer to, which are not already in the Raffles collection.\nTwo of the events of the past year, enumerated in the Secretary's Report, seem to claim special mention. One was the reception by the Society of Professor Nordenskjold and his companions in the \"Vega,\" on their homeward voyage, after having accomplished the North-East passage from Europe to China.\n\nThe other, which I consider of particular importance, is the publication by the Society of a new edition of the *Hikayat Abdullah*. This requires somewhat more consideration, because the action of the Council in the matter is liable to be challenged. There is the question, which was raised at one of our Meetings about another matter, whether it is within the scope of such a Society as ours to publish anything but the articles originally communicated to us and our own transactions. Now, if any considerable risk of pecuniary loss were involved in such publication, I should think that it would not be right to undertake it. But in this case we were secured, by the kind cooperation of the Educational Department in consenting to take over a considerable portion of the edition at a fixed price. Being thus secured against sinking the subscribers' money, we have been enabled to do, for a most important piece of Malayan literature, just what was done by the liberality of Governments and enlightened individuals at the beginning of the Renaissance for many of the Greek Classics that had been nearly lost. We have brought it out again into the light of day, and have put it within the reach of those who may be benefited by it.\n\nThere is no doubt that the efforts of Government, of religious bodies, and of benevolent individuals to spread education amongst the people here are beginning to bear fruit, and that the natives are slowly awakening to the advantages of acquiring knowledge. But they have very few books, and the desire for them is not sufficiently strong as yet to make them willing to incur much labour or expense in procuring them. This must be done for them, probably for another generation at least. Now there are few books which they are so likely to read as the story of Abdullah the Munshi, who, with a singularly pure diction, and in a most popular style, has given a slight and partial, but still a very truthful sketch, of a most important period in the history of these Settlements, illustrated, as one may say, with the most graphic pictures of life and manners in a time which is fast passing out of memory. The restoring and circulating of a book of this kind is likely to be a stimulus both to those who are themselves acquiring the elements of learning, and to those who are setting their children to do so. It is also not improbable that it may have the effect of teaching the natives to value other remains of their own literature which are still in their possession, and even of encouraging some of the most cultivated\namong them to make their own independent efforts in that field on which one of themselves achieved a great success. I consider, therefore, that, while the Society had its own proper objects in view when it undertook the preservation of this interesting example of Malay intelligence, it did not lose sight of them in putting it in the way of those for whom it was originally written.\n\nRECEPTION OF PROFESSOR NORDENSKJOLD.\n\n(Extract from the \"Straits Times\" of the 4th December.)\n\nMr. A. M. Skinner, Honorary Secretary, opens the Meeting by reading the following Resolution of the Society, at a Meeting of the Council held on 3rd November:\n\n\"The Council takes into consideration the information which has been received of the Vega's approaching visit to Singapore, and unanimously agrees to send to Professor Nordenskjold the hearty congratulations of this Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society upon his successful achievement of a North-East passage in his remarkable voyage through the Polar Seas from Sweden to Japan.\"\n\nShould the Vega, under the command of Captain Palander, and the distinguished party, visit our port, it is resolved to offer such a recognition as may be practicable of the importance of Professor Nordenskjold's achievements to science generally, and to those objects more particularly which the Asiatic Society exists to promote.\"\n\nMr. Skinner explains that in pursuance of this resolution Professor Nordenskjold and Captain Palander had been invited, thanks to the courtesy of the members of the Club, to meet the members of the Straits Branch of the Asiatic Society in the reading-room of the Club this evening, an invitation which both eminent men have kindly accepted.\n\nThe Venerable Archdeacon Hose says:\n\nProfessor Nordenskjold,\u2014In the name of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, assembled here to meet you, I have to offer you the most hearty congratulations upon the success of that great achievement which you, and your distinguished associates have just accomplished in effecting the North-Eastern Passage through the Arctic Ocean.\n\nIn all ages the North men have been bold enough to face the hardships of the frozen sea, tempted, in old times, by the desire of getting lands and wealth, and in our own better days by the hope\nof adding to the knowledge of this world of ours which men have already acquired. But too often, the tale of Arctic Exploration has been one of disappointment and failure; too often the discoverer's voyage has ended in his own grave. To very few has a brilliant success such as yours been given. Indeed we may say there are not many Geographical problems remaining of the magnitude and importance of that which the voyage of the Vega has solved. The satisfaction to yourself of having earned such a reward by your twenty years of labour among the dangers of the Northern Ocean must be very great.\n\nWhether the North-East passage comes to be used as one of the ordinary routes between Northern Europe and China, or not, the advantages of your difficult journey cannot fail to be real and lasting. If, as has been suggested in England, it should be found to demonstrate the possibility of placing meteorological stations\u2014which can be duly supplied and relieved\u2014at the most favourable points for observation on the coast of Northern Asia, so \"doubling\" \"the range of time over which our weather predictions now extend,\" \"and immensely increasing the range of surface for which predictions are issued,\" the beneficial results are indeed incalculable. In imagination we see countless sailors avoiding the storm which, had it not been foretold, would have overtaken and probably destroyed them; and countless merchants rejoicing over the added security which attends their ventures. Perhaps too it is not too great a stretch of the imaginative faculty to picture to ourselves the toiling populations and the anxious Governments of this great Continent escaping or mitigating the horrors of famine by the timely provision which forecasts of unfavourable seasons would enable them to make. And if such things as these are likely to result from increased opportunities of observing meteorological fluctuations in the Arctic regions, it will be a vast multitude, both on sea and land, that will have reason to admire the skill and courage which made such opportunities attainable.\n\nOn the other hand, when merchant ships from the East and from the West are traversing in safety the course which your journey has marked out; when new markets are being formed for the manufactures and the natural products of both Europe and Asia; and when the produce of the richest province in Siberia is being distributed over the world; when, too, the material comforts of civilization, and the light of religion and education are being conveyed to such peoples as the Tschutschis, whose misery and destitution your charity relieved, it will be impossible to estimate the additions to the sum of human happiness which this voyage of the Vega will have made.\n\nAs we believe this is the last evening of your stay here, we beg you to accept our warmest good wishes for your journey home.\nWe shall look with the most intense interest for the accounts of your arrival and of the reception you will meet with, both from your countrymen and from all who have the progress of civilization and science at heart, in the great cities of Europe which you may visit. We shall ever consider ourselves fortunate that the homeward course of the first circumnavigator of Europe and Asia brought him past our Settlement at the extreme South of that great Continent, and enabled us to meet one, who may look forward to the happiness of being reckoned among the benefactors of mankind.\n\nProfessor Nordenskjold replies as follows:\n\n\"The Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,\u2014The kind reception to-day by which the Straits Settlements' branch of the Royal Asiatic Society has honoured the Members of the Swedish Expedition has for us quite a peculiar interest, which could be afforded in no other place and by no other learned Society in the world.\n\nHaving passed the North Cape of Asia, Cape Tscheliskin, or the much discussed Promontorium Tabin of Ptolomeus, where even in the hottest summer's day the scanty vegetation and the scarce flowers are surrounded by ice and snow, where the land always was uninhabited, and where scarcely a man has been before us but the Russian Explorer whose name it bears; we at present enjoy the hospitality of a flourishing community in the southernmost part of Asia, where snow is unknown, and even during the winter a luxurious evergreen vegetation surrounds a numerous and thriving population. The contrast is so striking that one could hardly believe that it would be possible for men to sustain two so different climates.\n\nI believe, however, that the horrors with which popular authors have surrounded the Northern Coast of Asia are much exaggerated. It is true the winter we passed at the verge of the Polar Circle on the Tschukschi Peninsula was very serious, with a constant snow monsoon and a temperature often below the freezing point of mercury, more severe indeed than the winter I passed seven years ago nearly eight hundred miles farther to the North at a place where the sun for nearly four winter months is constantly below the horizon.\n\nBut even in the far North the summer has its charms, the snow melts and evaporates. The soil is then, during a few weeks, covered with a flower carpet unrivalled in the South. The ice breaks and melts away along the shores in the latter part of the summer. And finally Southerly winds and warm currents from the Siberian rivers open a broad channel of ice free water from\nJenesej to Bering. It is in this channel that the *Vega* made her North-East passage.\n\nI am persuaded this will not be the last time this channel will be navigated, as from immemorial time millions of birds emigrate from the extreme South to the shores of Northern Asia to breed and enjoy its short summer, so I think the time will come when numbers of seamen will, during some few weeks of every year, seek this coast for commercial purposes, importing merchandise to the mouth of the great and deep rivers of Siberia, and exporting from thence produce to Europe, Asia, and America, and I believe this navigation in the future will be attended with no peculiar dangers to the ships, or privations to the crews. For that aim, a more complete knowledge of the Polar regions, of the extension of land and sea, of the forming of the ice in the deep open ocean, of the currents in the Polar basin, the prevailing winds, &c., is of the utmost importance.\n\nI am persuaded that these geographical desiderata will soon be supplied. For, with the exception of the Polar basins, all the oceans of the globe at present are pretty well known. Very few momentous problems are left for future explorers, and there will be, no doubt, a lively competition among all the seafaring nations to gain the last laurels left.\n\nNo people has done so much to lift the veil which has, for a long time, surrounded the icy regions as the people of England, and no nation can boast of such a large mercantile marine, such a number of hardy seamen and skilful navigators. The enthusiasm with which this people, even in the remotest parts of its dominions, embraces our undertaking has been a source of great pleasure to me, as a certain pledge that our voyage will soon be followed by others, and, finally, by practical results, of what importance we at present hardly can form an exact idea.\n\nOnce more I thank you all for the kind reception to-day.\n\nCaptain Palander exhibits several charts and maps, which are anxiously scanned, giving details of the \"silent sea\" over which the *Vega* voyaged.\n\nThe Professor hands to Dr. Dennis, for the Museum, a specimen of quartz which he had brought from the extreme northern point of Asia.\nTHE MARITIME CODE\n\nOF THE\n\nMALAYS.\n\nBY SIR STAMFORD RAFFLES.\n\nPART II.\n\n(Continued from Journal No. 3, p. 81.)\n\nThe long admitted opinion that the Malays possess no records whatever of their laws and customs, and that they are solely governed in their disputes by established customs and usages, referred to as occasion may require from memory only, seems to have been much strengthened by the observations contained in Mr. Marsden's account of Sumatra; which, from its being the only standard book in the English language containing a detailed account of the Eastward, appears to have been considered by many as applying generally, and thus calculated to fit all the countries denominated Malayan; whereas, the Island of Sumatra possesses in itself an almost inexhaustible fund for research and enquiry; and can only be considered as one of the almost innumerable States, and by no means the greatest in population or even in extent, of that comprehensive and unparalleled archipelago throughout which the Malayan nation is established.\n\nThe Island of Sumatra, as well as the Island of Java, Tanah Ugi or Bugis land (Celebes), Sulu, and the Moluccas (which, with Borneo, compose what may be properly termed the Malayan group) are peopled by nations radically distinct from the Malays; who speak languages entirely different, and use various written characters original and peculiar to each; these nations are governed by\ntheir own Laws and Institutes; and if we except the State of Menangkabau on the Island of Sumatra, it is on the shores of these Islands only, and in the Malay Peninsula, that the Malays are to be found. Whatever may have been the origin of the Malayan nation, the population of these various and extensive Islands could never, according to any natural inference, have proceeded from the Malays; but the reverse, more probably, may have been the case, whatever may have been the extent borrowed from a more foreign source.\n\nNotwithstanding, therefore, the idea of Mr. Marsden that the various dialects of the Malayan tongue have experienced such changes with respect to the purposes of intercourse, that they may be classed into several languages differing considerably from each other, I cannot but consider the Malayan nation as one people, speaking one language, though spread over too wide a space to preserve their character and customs in all the maritime States lying between the Sulu Sea and the Southern Ocean, and bounded longitudinally by Sumatra and by the Western side of Papua or New Guinea; but as that point more naturally belongs to a dissertation on the origin of the nation and of its language, it need not be attended to here (where the subject is only alluded to); as it might be necessary, in finding out those boundaries to which the Malayan laws extend, to establish such distinctions and general definitions as may assist in its explanation and more ready comprehension.\n\nThe laws and customs of the Malays may, therefore, be considered either separately, or as they have reference to those of the more ancient and original inhabitants of the Eastern Islands with whom they are now so intimately connected. What may be termed the proper laws and proper customs of the Malayan nation, as it at present exists, will first be adverted to.\n\nIndependently of the Laws of the Koran, which are more or less observed in the various Malay States according to the influence of their Arabian and Mahomedan Teachers, seldom further than they affect matters of religion, marriage, and inheritance, they possess several Codes of Laws denominated Undang undang, or Institutes, of different antiquity and authority, compiled by their respective sovereigns; and every State of any extent possesses its own Undang undang. Through the whole there appears a general accordance; and where they differ, it is seldom beyond what situa-\ntion and superior advantages or authority have naturally dictated. Many of the Undang undang contain the mere regulations for the collection of the duties for trade and the peculiar observances of the Port; while others ascend to the higher branches of civil and criminal law.\n\nFrom the comparatively rude and uncivilised character of the Malay, neither learned disquisition, nor even general argument, is to be looked for; but simple ideas, simply expressed, may illustrate character better than scientific arrangement or refined composition; and, in this point of view, however local or particular the subject may be, the Institutes and Regulations of so extensive a maritime nation must be interesting.\n\nConsidering, therefore, that a translation of their Codes, digested and arranged according to one general plan, might be as useful in forming and insuring a more secure intercourse among this extraordinary and peculiar nation, as it might be interesting in illustrating the unjustly degraded character of so extensive a portion of the human race hitherto so little known, whether with respect to what they are, or what they were, I have long been engaged, as far as the severe duties of my public situation would admit, in collecting, at much trouble and considerable expense, Malay manuscripts of every description; and particularly copies of the Undang undang Malayu, which, with the various collections of Adat, or immemorial customs, and what may be usefully extracted from the Sejara and Akal Malayu, or annals and traditions of the Malays, comprize what may be termed the whole body of the Malay laws, customs, and usages, as far as they can be considered original, under the heads of Government Property, Slavery, Inheritance, and Commerce.\n\nOn the Eastern side of Sumatra, the Malay States of Achin and Palembang may be considered as of the most importance. From these States I already possess one copy of the Undang undang Achin, with a short account of the Undang undang Siak. Further copies of these, as well as of the Institutes of Palembang, I have reason to believe, are within my reach.\n\nThe laws of Achin are peculiar, on account of the severity of the criminal laws; and although it may be presumed that they were borrowed from the more ancient inhabitants of the Island, they are interesting in as far as they may have been generally adopted by\nthe Malays in the Straits of Malacca; and may have given rise to that sanguinary disposition by which they are usually characterised.\n\nThose of Siak have a peculiar interest from the long established connection between that State and the Undang undang source in the interior. The Siak River takes its rise in the Menangkabau country, and has obviously been the principal outlet from the rich and populous countries in the interior, of which so little is known.\n\nThe Malay customs and usages on the West Coast of Sumatra, I apprehend to be so much blended with those of the more original inhabitants of the Island, that even if there was a State among them of sufficient importance to have its own Institutes, it would scarcely deserve consideration in the general arrangement of what is purely Malayan; and they are, consequently, unattended to.\n\nOf the Malay Peninsula, the principal States entitled to notice on the Western side are those of Kedah, Malacca, and Johor; and on the Eastern those of Tr\u00e9ngg\u00e1nu, Pat\u00e2ni, and Pahang. From these I have obtained and collected several copies of the Undang undang Kedah, the Undang undang Malaka, and the Undang undang Johor. The States on the Eastern side of the Peninsula, with the exception of Pat\u00e2ni which has been considerably influenced by the Siamese, seem generally to have admitted the superiority of the Malay Government, first established at Singapore and afterwards at Johor.\n\nOn the Island of Borneo, the several Malay States have Regulations and Institutes peculiar to each; not differing in any material degree from those of the Peninsula. Some of these I have already obtained, and others are in part transcribed.\n\nThe Malayan Code, stated to have been compiled during the reign of Sultan Mahmud Shah, of which I have three copies, treats principally of commercial and maritime usages; and is, in these branches, intended to form the text; whilst the Institutes of Johor, from the intimate connection which appears always to have existed between Malacca and the Southern part of the Peninsula, may be useful as a supplement on these points; at the same time that it will branch out into civil and criminal law generally and the general principles of communication between the different States.\nThe Kedah Code may, in like manner, form the text for such part of the Institutes as may be most usefully applied in the intercourse of Europeans; and will tend to a general understanding of the character and usages of the Malay countries in the immediate vicinity of the British Settlements. This State, until the establishment of the English at Pulo Pinang, possessed respectable commerce; and still retains its Malayan Government and Institutions, though reduced in importance, and applicable only to internal affairs.\n\nThe Institutes of the smaller States, as of Sel\u00e2ngor, Perak, and others, may only require notice as far as they differ from the general Codes of the superior States.\n\nAs the population of the Malayan Peninsula has excited much interest, my attention has been particularly directed to the various tribes stated to be scattered over the country.\n\nThose on the hills are usually termed Semang, and are woolly-headed; those on the plains Orang benua, or people belonging to the country, the word benua being applied by the Malays to any extensive country as benua China, benua Kiing; but it appears to be only the Malay plural of the Arabic word bin or beni, signifying a tribe. The early adventurers from Arabia frequently make mention in their writings of the different tribes they met with to the Eastward; and from them, most probably, the Malays have adopted the term Orang benua.\n\nI had an opportunity of seeing two of those people from a tribe in the neighbourhood of Malacca. It consisted of about sixty people. The tribe was called Jokanq. These people, from their occasional intercourse with the villages dependent on Malacca, speak the Malayan language sufficiently to be generally understood; they relate that there are two other tribes, the Orang benua and the Orang udai. The former appears the most interesting as composing the majority; the latter is only another name for the Semang or Kafirs.\n\nFrom the intercourse and vicinity of the Jokanq tribe to Malacca, they have adopted many Malay words not originally in their language; and the following short specimen may, perhaps, tend to illustrate their connection, and to evince how far they possess a peculiar language. They are not circumcised, but appear to have re-\nceived some instruction regarding Nabi Isa, or, as they pronounce it, Isher. They have no books or peculiar word for God, whom they designate by Deus, evidently Portuguese. The men are well formed, rather short; resembling the Malays in countenance, but having a sharper and smaller nose. They may have but one wife, whether rich or poor, and appear to observe no particular ceremony at their nuptials; the consent of the girl and that of the parents once obtained, they are united as man and wife.\n\nThe Jokang language, in general, coincides with the Malay, as in the following instances:\n\n| Earth | Fire | Fish | Bird | Eye | Nose | Teeth | Belly | Sun | Mouth | Eyebrow | Old | Good |\n|-------|------|------|------|-----|------|-------|-------|-----|-------|--------|-----|------|\n| Tanah | Api  | Ikan | Burong | Mata | Hidong | Gigi | Prut | Mata-hari | Mulut | Kening | Tuha | Baik |\n\nThe numerals are also the same as in Malay.\n\nIn the following instances they differ from the Malay:\n\n| Moon | Stars | Water | Tiger | Dog | Bear | Elephant | Rhinoceros | Foot | Child | Infant | Arrows | House |\n|------|-------|-------|-------|-----|------|----------|-------------|------|-------|--------|--------|-------|\n| Hunter Ishub (the laid spirit.) | Chiang | Yehs | Kokang | Kayape | Seho | Berenkel | Vesaki | Tamen | Merbodo | Opayet | Tornan | Cheringu |\nHead ... ... ... ... Retah\nWild-hog ... ... ... ... Chang Khok\nDevil ... ... ... ... Choling\n\nAs the relations that may have existed between the State of Menangkabau on the Island of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula is not generally known, the following translation of a Malay manuscript, to which I give some credit, may be interesting. The circumstances related are without date or authority, but it is in a great degree confirmed by the general history of Johor, and the present state of the country in the neighbourhood, as well as by the existence at this day of another Malay State of considerable extent, situated in the interior of the peninsula, and deriving its authority from Menangkabau in Sumatra. The State alluded to is that of Rambau, inland of Malacca, the Raja of which, as well as his Officers, receive their authority and appointments from Sumatra. Communication is carried on in the Malay Peninsula, through the River Linggi in the neighbourhood of Malacca, and that of Siak on the Sumatra side. The Malays of Rambau, with whom I have now had frequent communication, adopt the broad dialect of the Malays of Sumatra; changing the \\(a\\), at the end of a word into \\(o\\),\u2014 a peculiarity which may be still observed among many of the inhabitants of the southern part of the Peninsula:\n\n\"Many years ago, the Raja of Johor had an only daughter, the fame of whose beauty reached the ears of the illustrious son of the Raja of Menangkabau, whose residence is at Pagaruyong in Pulau Percha and whose power is mighty. The young Prince enamoured with the enchanting descriptions of this beauty, entreated his father's permission to make the voyage to Johor for his recreation, and the Raja his father was pleased to comply with his request.\n\n\"The young Prince accordingly embarked from the shores of Pulau Percha, attended by a numerous retinue suited to his high rank and splendid fortune.\n\n\"On the arrival of the Prince from the Island of Sumatra in the Straits of Johor, he was desirous of immediately proceeding up the river, but the Raja of Johor, alarmed at the unexpected appearance of so large a fleet with a Royal Standard, refused him admittance. The Prince, determined on proceeding, entered the River; and being opposed by the Johorians a severe battle ensued,\"\nin which the men of Johor were defeated, and obliged to retreat in confusion.\n\n\"On the result of the action being made known to the Raja of Johor, he assembled his Nobles and Officers of State, and advised with them as to the conduct that should be pursued, fearful that the men of Johor, who were worsted in the first engagement, might not have the power or courage to stand in a second. It was their unanimous opinion, that the Prince should be invited to proceed up the River on friendly terms, and the Prince was accordingly invited.\n\n\"The Prince lost no time in proceeding with his suite up the River, where they landed from the Royal Prahu, and he was received as a Raja high in rank. The Raja of Johor then enquired of him the business that had brought him there, and what were his wishes, to which the Prince replied, that he was enamoured of his daughter, and came to solicit her in marriage. The Raja, having consulted with his Nobles and Officers of State, agreed to the marriage; and a place was allotted for the residence of the Prince and his followers. In a short time the Prince was married to the daughter of the Raja, and they lived together in the district that had been allotted to them; and their happiness increased every day. How long did this last?\n\n\"The Prince soon became delighted with his Princess, and so pleased with the attentions of the Raja of Johor, and the compound or district allotted to him, which now bore the name of Kampong Menangkabau, that he thought not of returning to the territories of his Royal father, but remained in Johor with his followers; many of whom married with the women of Johor, so that their numbers increased daily.\n\n\"The Raja of Johor having afterwards conferred on the Prince the title of Yang Dipertuan Kechil, and, in consequence, given him considerable power and authority in Johor, the Prince exercised it with great severity. The increasing consequence of the Prince, added to his severity, alarmed the Raja Muda's friends and adherents, who were very numerous, and they consulted as to the measures that should be taken. The Nobles were so enraged that the power of Government was almost entirely taken out of the hands of the men of Johor, and that a stranger should assume au-\nthereby, that they respectfully submitted the circumstance to the serious consideration of the Raja, requesting that the whole of the Menangkabaus might be removed from Johor, or they would be soon enslaved by them.\n\n\"The Raja listened not to their request; and the Raja Muda becoming more enraged, he again assembled his friends and adherents, and the number of those who were dissatisfied with the Menangkabaus being allowed to remain in Johor becoming very great, they unanimously agreed, to the number of above eight hundred, to proceed, with long krises, into the compound of the Menangkabaus and put them to death; this resolution being fixed at midday. They were desirous, however, of securing from danger the daughter of the Raja, and, accordingly, previous to the attack, a few men entered the compound at sunset unobserved, and brought the Princess in safety to the Raja Muda.\n\n\"The Prince, entering the apartment where he expected to find the Princess, searched in vain for her; and aware of the enmity of the Raja Muda, he instantly assembled all the Menangkabaus; the gong was sounded and all were in arms.\n\n\"Accompanied by all the Menangkabau men who were in the compound at the time, the Prince sallied forth in search of his Princess; no sooner were they without the compound than the Raja Muda, hearing them approach, advanced against them; a severe battle ensued, which lasted from before midnight until daylight next morning, and in which four hundred of the men of Johor were slain.\n\n\"In the morning the Prince re-entered the compound, and was closely followed by the remaining force of the Raja Muda; these, however, were soon slain to a man by the Menangkabaus, and the Raja Muda only escaped with his life, having taken the precaution of returning to his house unobserved, before daylight.\n\n\"The Prince, exasperated at the treacherous conduct of the men of Johor, and offended that the Raja should permit the Raja Muda thus openly to attack him, proceeded the next morning with all his men in order to give battle to the Raja himself, to revenge the ill-treatment he had received, and, if possible, recover the Princess, his wife. A severe engagement took place, which last-\ned all day, and with the darkness of the night, the men of Johor fled in every direction.\n\n\"The Raja proceeded to Tringg\u00e2nu, and the Raja Muda with his family took shelter in a neighbouring wood.\n\n\"Intimation of the place of the Raja Muda's retreat being conveyed to the Prince, he immediately proceeded thither, and completely surrounded him. The Raja Muda finding himself in this extremely awkward position, and no hope of escape left, put his family to death one by one, in order that they might not fall into the hands of the enemy; after which he went forth from the interior of the wood and endeavoured to rush through the Menangkabaus who surrounded it, but in vain; being repulsed in every direction he threw down his sword, and was in a few moments slain. The Prince having thus revenged himself on the Raja Muda, and finding that the Raja of Johor had fled to Tringg\u00e2nu, pursued him thither. On the Prince's arrival at Tringg\u00e2nu he demanded of the Raja, that the Raja of Johor should be given up to him, and the Raja of Tringg\u00e2nu complied with his request; and the Raja of Johor being delivered up was immediately put to death by the enraged Menangkabaus.\n\n\"The Prince then recovered his wife from the Raja of Tringg\u00e2nu with whom she had been left by her father; and having remained a few days at Tringg\u00e2nu, he returned with his followers to Johor. At Johor he remained till such time as the Prahus could be repaired and victualled for the voyage, and then embarked with the Menangkabaus for the kingdom of his father.\n\n\"Several, however, of the Menangkabaus remained in the country of Johor, in consequence of their being united in marriage to the Johor women. The country of Johor, which was previously well cultivated, was soon overgrown with wood; but the compound in which the men of Menangkabau resided, still bears the name of 'Kampong Menangkabau;' and many people are still to be found scattered over the country who call themselves Menangkabaus, as it was for many years that the Prince resided in that country, and those connected with him and his followers had become very numerous.\"\nThe ancient connection that existed between Malacca and Johor is particularly noticed in Malayan History, according to which, the first Raja of Malacca, Sultan Iskander Shah, afterwards, on his embracing the Mahomedan faith, called Sultan Mahmud Shah, is supposed to have been a Raja of Singapura (an ancient Malay State near the site of Johor), who had taken refuge there on his kingdom being invaded and destroyed by an armament from the Island of Java. The subsequent flight of the Malacca Raja to the Southern part of the Peninsula, on the establishment of the Portuguese, is related in several Malay books in my possession; from one of which the following is a literal translation. Malacca is considered as the principal State on the Peninsula. The fall of its native Government is interesting, although the records must be of modern date. Sultan Mahmud Shah, the present Raja of Lingga and Rhio, whither the seat of Government has long been transferred from Johor, still traces his descent from the Rajas of Malacca.\n\nTranslation of a Malayan Manuscript entitled a History of former times, containing an account of the arrival of the Portuguese at Malacca.\n\n\"It is related, that ten Portuguese vessels from Manila arrived at Malacca for the purpose of trade, during the reign of Sultan Ahmed Shah, at a time when that country possessed an extensive commerce, and everything in abundance: when the affairs of Government were correctly administered, and the officers properly appointed.\n\n\"At the time that their ships arrived, the fort was composed of Nibong alas; how many Portuguese entered the fort, and with what presents of gold, of dollars, of cloths, and of Manila chains, did they present themselves before the Raja, and how pleased to excess was Sultan Ahmed Shah with the Portuguese; whatever the Commander required, Sultan Ahmed Shah was ready to grant; but how many of the Bandahara and Temenggongs, with due obedience, urged the Raja to be on his guard against the Portuguese, 'for,' said they, 'the most experienced among us does not recollect a misfortune so great as the arrival of the Portuguese;' to this the Raja would reply 'alas! revered Bandahara and you respected Temenggongs, you know nothing when you\n'state that these white men will do what is wrong in our country.'\n\n\"For forty days the Portuguese ships traded at Malacca, but still the Portuguese Commander remained on shore presenting dollars by the chest, and gold; and how many beautiful cloths did he present to the illustrious Sultan Ahmed Shah, so that the Sultan was most happy.\n\n\"The Bendihaara and the Temenggongs still remained of the same opinion respecting the Portuguese, and were not well inclined towards them; but finding that their representations were not attended to, nor well received by the Raja, they ceased to make them. To how many of the rich and great men did the Commander of the Portuguese present Manila chains, and how pleased was every one with the Portuguese; the Bendihaara and the Temenggongs were alone dissatisfied.\n\n\"After this Sultan Ahmed Shah said to the Commander of the Portuguese, 'what more do you require from us that you tender us such rich presents?' To this the Commander replied 'we only request one thing of our friend, should he still be well inclined towards the white men;' whereupon Sultan Ahmed Shah said 'state what it is, that I may hear it, and if it is in my power I will comply with the request of my friend.' The Portuguese answered, 'we wish to request a small piece of ground to the extent of what the skin of a beast may cover;' 'Then,' said the Raja, 'let not my friends be unhappy; let them take whatever spot of ground they like best to the extent of what they request.'\n\n\"The Captain highly rejoiced at this; and the Portuguese immediately landed, bringing with them spades, bricks and mortar. The Commander then took the skin of the beast, and, having rent it into cords, measured therewith a piece of ground with four sides, within which the Portuguese built a store house of very considerable dimensions, leaving large apertures in the walls for guns; and when the people of Malacca enquired the reason of the apertures being left, the Portuguese returned for answer, 'they are apertures that the white men require for windows,' so that the people of Malacca were satisfied and content. Alas! how often did the Bendihaara and the Temenggongs approach the Raja with a request that the white men might not be permitted to build a large house; but the Raja would say, 'my eyes are upon them, and they are few\nin number; if they do what is wrong, whatever it may be, I shall see it, and will give orders for their being massacred;\u2019 literally, \u2018I will order men to amok (or, as it is vulgarly termed, run amok) among them;\u2019 notwithstanding this, the B\u00ebndah\u00fbra and the Temenggongs remained dissatisfied in their hearts, for they were wise men.\n\n\u201cAfter this, the Portuguese, during the night, conveyed into their store-house cannon, and they landed small arms packed in chests, saying the contents were cloths; and in this manner did the Portuguese deceive and cheat the people of Malacca.\n\n\u201cWhat the Portuguese next did, the people of Malacca were ignorant of; but it was not long before the store house was completed; and when all their arms were in order, then it was that at midnight, at a time when the people of Malacca were asleep, that the Portuguese began to fire off their guns from the Fort of Malacca.\n\n\u201cThey soon destroyed all the houses of the people of Malacca, and their Nibong Fort; and it was during the night when the Portuguese first attacked the people of Malacca, that Raja Ahmed Shah with his people, fled in all directions, for none could remain to oppose the Portuguese.\n\n\u201cThus did the Portuguese gain possession of Malacca; whilst Sultan Ahmed Shah fled to Moar, and from thence, in a short time, to Johor, and afterwards to Bintan, to establish another country; such is the account of the Portuguese seizure of the kingdom of Malacca, from the hands of the Sultan Ahmed Shah.\n\n\u201cIt is related, that the Portuguese remained in quiet possession of the country of Malacca for three years; after which they sent letters to their great country, which is called Goa, giving an account that the kingdom of Malacca was conquered. As soon as this intelligence arrived, the Raja of the Portuguese was exceedingly happy, and in about two months after he answered the letters, and ordered the Portuguese to build the Fort at Malacca of iron-stone, and that the form of the Fort should be like that at Goa; such was the occasion of the Fort of Malacca resembling that of Goa.\n\"As soon as the letters arrived at Malacca from the Raja of Goa, the Portuguese who were in Malacca ordered such of the people as had remained there to bring iron-stones for the Fort from Kwala Linggi, Perlan Upi, Batu Bras, Pulau Java, a small Island near Malacca, from Telur Mass, from Pesan Pringgi, from Pulau Burong, and from the country in the interior of Malacca; and the price the Portuguese paid for them, was at the rate of 30 dollars per 100 stones of large, and 20 dollars per 100 stones of small size. For the eggs which they used in their mortar, the Portuguese paid at the rate of a wang bharu (new coin) for each. For lime (kapur) they paid fifteen dollars for a koyan; and the coolies employed digging away the hill, were paid at the rate of half a dollar each for one day's work. During thirty-six years three months and fourteen days the Portuguese were employed in the construction of the Fort; and then it was completed.\n\n\"From this time the Portuguese remained in quiet possession of Malacca about nine years and one month, when the country once more began to flourish, and the trade became extensive on account of the quantities of merchandise brought there from all quarters. Such is the account of the country of Malacca under the Portuguese.\n\n\"It is related, that after this period a Dutch vessel arrived at Malacca for the purpose of trading; the vessel's name was Afterlenden and that of the Captain Iker. The Captain perceived that Malacca was a very fine place, and had a good Fort, therefore, after the Dutch vessel had traded for fifteen days he set sail for Europe, and arriving after a considerable time at the great country, he gave intelligence to the great Raja of what he had seen of the beauty of Malacca, the extent of its commerce, and the excellence of its fort. On this the Raja of Europe said, 'If such is the account of Malacca it is proper that I should order it to be attacked;' twenty-five vessels were thereupon ordered there by the Raja of Europe for the purpose of attacking Malacca, and, troops being embarked on each, they first set sail for the kingdom of Bantam in the country of Java, where the Dutch were in terms of friendship.\n\n\"At Bantam they found two Dutch ships and a ketch, and after having taken on board buffaloes and provisions for the use of the persons on board the vessels, they sailed for Malacca.\"\n\"As soon as the fleet arrived at Malacca the Commander sent a letter to the Portuguese, telling them to hold themselves in readiness, as it was the intention of the Dutch to commence the attack on the morrow at midday. To this the Portuguese replied, 'come when you please we are ready.'\n\n\"On the next day the Dutch commenced the attack, and the war continued for about two months, but the country of Malacca was not carried; and the Dutch returned to Bantam, where they remained quiet for some time with the intention of returning to Europe; but all the great men on board the vessels feeling ashamed of what had happened, held consultation respecting another attack on Malacca; they then proceeded against it a second time, but it did not surrender. The Dutch then sent a letter off to Johor in terms of friendship to the Sultan, requesting his assistance in the attack of Malacca: with this the Raja of Johor was pleased, and an agreement was entered into between the Raja of Johor and the Dutch, which was sworn to, so that the Dutch and Malays were as one as far as concerned the taking of Malacca. An agreement was made that the Dutch should attack from sea, and the people of Johor by land; if the country surrendered the Dutch were to retain the country and the cannon, and everything else that might be found within Malacca was to be equally divided between the Dutch and the people of Johor.\n\n\"When the terms were agreed upon, the men of Johor and the Dutch sailed for Malacca; and after fighting for about fifteen days from the seaside, many were slain, as well Portuguese as Malays and Dutch. The Malays then held a consultation and began to think that if they fought against the white men according to this fashion, Malacca would not fall in fourteen years.\n\n\"It was therefore, agreed upon by all the Malays, that fifty men should enter the Fort of Malacca and run amok.\n\n\"The Malays then selected a lucky day; and on the 21st of the month, at 5 o'clock in the morning, fifty Malays entered the Fort did Mengamok, and every Portuguese was either put to death or forced to fly into the interior of the country, without order or regularity.\n\n\"On this all the Malays plundered to a great extent in Malacca, and the whole was divided between the men of Johor and the...\"\nDutch, according to their agreement.\n\n\"The men of Johor then returned to their country, and the Dutch remained in possession of Malacca; and from that time to the present, the Dutch and the men of Johor have been on the strictest terms of friendship.\n\n\"This is the account of former times.\"\n\nTo return to the subject of the Undang undang Malayu, it will appear, from what I have previously stated, that the collection, as far as regards the Malayan nation separately, is nearly completed, but as I have in view the more extensive plan of embracing the original institutes of the various nations among the eastern Islands, some time may elapse before it may be in any considerable degree of forwardness.\n\nOf those there will be the institutes of Java and of the Bugis States on the Island of Lekassun, which are first in importance.\n\nOn the Island of Java there are several Undang undang celebrated to the Eastward, but as the whole Island of Java was once under the dominion of the ancient Emperor of Susuhunang Gire Aporoi that is still acknowledged to a certain extent, these may no doubt be traced to one source and authority; the difficulty that has hitherto existed in communicating with Java in consequence of the Dutch establishment, has prevented the acquisition of the most importance. The Javanese laws are arranged in native codes of considerable antiquity, and were collected many years back by the Dutch Government for the guidance of their different officers; of this collection I possess a copy, which will at any rate assist in the compilation or translation of more genuine codes from native authority, whenever circumstances may admit of a communication being opened with the Javanese Rajas and Nobles.\n\nFrom the Bugis and Macassar nations of Tanah Ugi (Celebes) I have already received detached parts of the Undang undang; but the copies that have yet reached me are so incomplete and inaccurate, and bear such recent traces of being but imperfect transcripts from a better digested and regular code, that they cannot be depended on, and rather excite than satisfy enquiry. I have long adopted\nmeasures with the view of obtaining if not originals at least more perfect transcripts, in which I have every reason to expect I shall be successful. The two principal codes on this Island are those of Macassar and Boni. The laws as well as the history of the Bugis States are of considerable antiquity, perhaps far exceeding those on the Island of Java; these are preserved in books, the greater part of which are extant, but only to be found in their purity inland.\n\nWith respect to the Sulu Islands, I have a short account of their laws and usages, though no regular code. Several interesting particulars connected therewith have been collected by Mr. Alexander Dalrymple, and printed in the \"Oriental Repository.\"\n\nOf the Moluccas, I have not yet been able to obtain further information than what has tended to confirm, in every respect, the detailed and full account given by Valentyn; but as these Islands have lately fallen into the hands of the English, whatever may be desiderated from that quarter may easily be obtained. Though the interior of the Islands still possesses an original population, their government has long been Malayan.\n\nAs nothing beyond an imperfect description of a few original tribes has yet been obtained respecting the inland population of Borneo, it may be inferred, that as there appears to have been no original nation of authority, or of extent adequate to reach the shore or to be known by any of the States that have been established on the coast, their institutes, if they possess any, cannot be important, as they have not had any effect on the general population of the Eastern Archipelago.\n\nOn Sumatra, Mr. Marsden has so well and diligently trodden the ground, that we cannot, perhaps, contrary to his assertion, expect to find written laws and institutes among any of the original nations.\n\nThe compilation that has been made by the English Resident will form a valuable standard for comparison with the laws and customs of the more Eastern Islands, but at the same time a more extensive research into the interior, if unsuccessful in its principal object, cannot fail to be interesting, in as far as it may lead to a more intimate acquaintance with the Battas and Menangkabaus;\nthe former of which may be considered as the original population of the Island, while the establishment of the Menangkabaus may be compared to that of the Moguls on the Continent of India. In the Ketchehalima, or \"Fine times of the Battas,\" adopted by the Malays, of which I have a copy, the divisions of lucky and unlucky times for undertaking any affair are expressed by the terms Masewara Bisma Bihana Sulala, or, more correctly pronounced, Mukiswara Wishna Birahana Sulala, corresponding to the Hindoo Deities.\n\nThe table for calculating superstitions is extremely simple.\n\nTo the collection that has already been made of the various laws and usages of the Malays, Sumatrans, Bugis, Maccassars, and Sulus, must be added the Mahomedan Laws of Inheritance, printed by the Dutch at Batavia in 1760, in 102 articles, Dutch and Malayan; of this I possess a copy.\n\nAs the collection is so various and extended, the compilation must necessarily be deferred until the best authorities procurable can be referred to, and, if possible, the leading native courts visited. I request to present to the Asiatic Society a sketch of the Maritime Code of the Malays as translated from the duplicate copies I have brought with me to Bengal, and which, when corrected by more original copies that I may hereafter obtain, and elucidated by notes corresponding with the general plan of the undertaking, I purpose shall form six books of the Malay Laws.\n\nIn tracing back the Malayan laws to that of the more ancient nations on the Islands of Sumatra, Java, and Celebes, and from thence perhaps, on one side to the Continent of India, and on the other to the large Islands in the South Seas, a wide field will be opened for research, as well into the original, as into those extraordinary languages which, in the proportion that they are correctly spoken or written, seem to approach the Sanscrit.\n\nThe comparatively modern origin of the Malays is a fact so generally admitted, and universally supported by all their writings and traditions, that it is difficult to account for the extraordinary opinion laid down by the author of the sketch * of an intended\n\n* Entitled \"A Rough Sketch of part of an intended Essay towards ascertaining deducting, elucidating and correcting established Monuments of the Jahwa or Jahwi Language, vulgarly called the Malay Language,\" by S. S., published at Prince of Wales' Island, in 1807.\nEssay on the Malayan language, that the Arabians and Persians have borrowed their present alphabetical characters from the Malays, an opinion that could only hope to attract attention from the confident manner in which it is asserted. The proofs that seem to have occurred to the writer of the language being from the primeval stock of Java, and one of the sons of Japheth, the third son of Noah, from the roots of the old Persian and the Sanscrit and Arabic derivatives and compounds which have been formed, may as well be adduced in supporting a similar comparison between the English and Latin tongues; we should be rather surprised to find the former, from the number of ancient words it has adopted, asserted to be the parent of the Roman tongue.\n\nIt is easy and natural to account for the Malays having, in their religion, adopted the written character of the Arabs; and I have no hesitation in asserting, that neither Malay writings nor inscriptions, in their present character, can be traced back to periods of greater antiquity than the alleged invention of the modern Arabic alphabet, or beyond the epoch at which the great intercourse between the Arabian and the Eastern nations took place. Admitting however, that more early writings did exist, there is no reason why they may not have been preserved in Sumatra in the more ancient and original characters of the Battas, the Rejangs, or the Lampongs; in Java and the Balatas, in the characters of the Javandore and Bugis nations; and even in the Malay Peninsula, by a modified character of the Siamese.\n\nFor the component parts of the Malayan language, as it at present exists, and the sources from whence we must trace the origin of the nation and its language, I beg to refer to the enlightened statement, printed in the transactions, by the author of the \"Essay on the Indu-Chinese Nations,\" whose enlarged views and determined position will, I am convinced, be the more confirmed and verified, in the proportion that they may be enquired into.\n\nThe most obvious and natural origin of the Malays, is that they did not exist, as a separate and distinct nation, anterior to the arrival of the Arabians in the Eastern Seas. At the present day they seem to differ from the original nation from which they sprung, in about the same degree as the Chuliah or Kling differs from the Tamul or Telinga on the Coromandel Coast, or the Mapillas of Mar-\ntaban differ from the\u2014\u2014\u2014,* both which people appear, in like manner with the Malays, to have been gradually formed as nations, and separated from their original stock by the admixture of Arabian blood, and the introduction of the Arabic language and Moslem religion.\n\nThe word Jawi, so much insisted on, is the Malay for anything mixed or crossed, as when the language of one country is written in the character of another, it is termed Bhasa Jawi, or mixed language, or when a child is born of a Kling father and Malay mother, it is called Anak Jawi, a child of a mixed race: thus the Malay language being written in the Arabic character is termed Bhasa Jawi, the Malays, as a nation distinct from the fixed populations of the Eastern Islands, not possessing any written character whatever but what they borrow from the Arabs.\n\nWith respect to the Maritime Code, which I have now the honour to lay before the Society, it has been selected on account of its singularity. The power of life and death vested in the Nacodah may be considered as purely Malayan, or at any rate to have had its origin in the Eastern Islands, the Arabs, from whom alone they could have borrowed a foreign Sea Code not possessing, as far as I have been able to ascertain, any treatise whatever on Maritime Law or in any instance admitting the authority of the Nacodah, or Captain, of a vessel to inflict capital punishment. In this point of view, the paper, even in its present state, may not be uninteresting, while it may tend in a slight degree to account for, if not reconcile, some of the peculiarities of a nation generally believed to be guided solely by individual will and passion.\n\n* Unintelligible.\nABOUT KINTA.\n\nBY\n\nH. W. C. LEECH, LL.B., F.C.D.\n\nPART I.\n\n(Read at a Meeting of the Society, held on the 13th October, 1879.)\n\nIn the following paper, I propose giving a short description of this most interesting and, to the outer world, almost unknown part of the country.\n\nThe P\u00earak River, the largest river on the western side of the Malay Peninsula, flows nearly the whole length of the country, taking its rise in the northern frontier and falling into the sea a few miles North of the Bernam River, the southern boundary. Nearly all its water is drawn from the tributaries on the eastern (left) bank, and it is of the country drained by those tributaries that I write.\n\nBeginning from the North, about 12 or 15 miles above Kwala Kangsa, we have the mouth of the Plus. From native report, the valley drained by this river is known to be very extensive, the soil exceptionally good, and the mineral resources considerable; tin, which exists all over P\u00earak, is worked there to a small extent by the Malays, and gold is known to exist. A jungle path, with easy gradients practicable for elephants and horned cattle, exists along the valley of the Plus, across the water shed of the peninsula into Pat\u00e2ni, and oxen have frequently been brought from there to L\u00e2rut.\nvia Kwala Kangsa. A continuation of the road at present existing from Larut to Kwala Kangsa, or, better still, I believe, a light tramway, will not only open up the extensive valley of the Pius, but will also, no doubt, in time attract a large portion of the products of Patani, which, in consequence of the North-east monsoon, cannot find an outlet to the sea on the East coast for nearly six months of the year.\n\nTill quite recently, this valley had never even been visited by an European; but during the present month Mr. Deane, a gentleman from Ceylon who is in treaty with the Government of Perak to undertake a survey of the country, has gone there from Kinta, and I quote the following passages from a letter which I received from him from the Pius, dated 5th June, 1879:\n\n\"From Chumer I went to Lankor, on the right bank of the river Kurubu, a tributary of the Pius, which takes its rise on the northern slopes of the Gunong Robinson range, not far from the peak itself.\"\n\n\"This Kurubu is a river of considerable size, is pretty fast, and must drain a considerable area. Its course from rise is N.W.\" Here I may remark that I am very much inclined to think that this river, the Kurubu, will be found to drain the eastern face of Gunong Robinson, to which I shall refer further on. Mr. Deane continues:\n\n\"My trip to the range adjoining the Pius drainage and forming part of it, has impressed me very favourably as regards the quality of the soil. It is out and out far superior to any I have yet seen in Perak, and in many parts is simply magnificent, being a fine free chocolate-coloured soil, resting on a friable clay, but the latter so free from admixture with sand, &c., as to be good for cultivation for many feet below the surface. Formation is granite as usual. On my way here I passed and secured magnificent specimens of lime, the finest I have seen, I think, anywhere. From the top of Gunong Aslet you look over the Pius valley, which is of great extent, to a height of 6,000 to 8,000 feet, and ranges away in the distance, say 40 to 70 miles, covering an arc of 26\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 of the circle.\"\nI have now, I think, transcribed enough from Mr. Drane's letter to give an idea of the extent and facilities of the Plus valley, and will leave him to describe it in detail, as I have reason to hope he will give the public the benefit of the information he has obtained during his visit to P\u00earak.\n\nNext, South of the Plus, comes the Kinta River, separated from the P\u00earak River by a range of hills commonly called the Blanja range. The highest points in this range are from 3,000 to 4,000 feet in elevation. None of the coffee planters from Ceylon who have crossed this range have been much pleased with it, thinking the soil too stiff and climate too moist for coffee, whatever it might be for tea or other cultivation. Because coffee planters condemn it, however, it must not be imagined that this range is worthless; some of the richest deposits of tin in P\u00earak are found along its eastern base; this deposit of tin, technically called stream tin, is found in two formations; the upper one, the natural soil of the ground, formed by the denudation of the hills, consists of a light sandy loom in which a considerable proportion of tin sand exists: working this is the mining which the Malays affect; the work is light, it consists in damming up a small stream and then conducting the water by a number of artificial channels, where the soil is washed away, the tin ore, in consequence of its greater weight, being left in the drain; when this has gone on sufficiently long, the water is turned into another channel, and the ore removed from the bed of the dry one. Below this surface soil, at various depths in different parts of the district, true ore-bearing stratum is reached, \"pay dirt\" as it is called in Australia; the depth at which it is found varies from one to eight or nine fathoms, and this is what the Chinese usually mine for. Notwithstanding the present depreciated price of tin, both Malay and Chinese miners are making money, which speaks for itself as to the richness of the deposits; a stream is just as necessary to the Chinese miners at it is to Malays; the latter use the water to remove the soil, and the former pump the water out of their mines with a very ingenious water-wheel; there are consequently large tracts where neither can work, and in these there exists the opening for European enterprise; a large capital is not required, but a practical knowledge of mining is absolutely necessary; with both combined large profits would be a certainty; when the present miners, with their rude appliances and wasteful methods of mining and smelting, can make a good profit, what would not more\nscientific methods do?\n\nWhile on the subject of mining, I may mention, that, up to this, all the work is confined to the plains. Lodes no doubt exist in the hills from which the deposits at the foot have been formed, and at some future date it may be found profitable to work them, but, till the rich deposits of stream tin are exhausted, I doubt if much will be sought in situ.\n\nClose to Pengkalan Katcha, the port of embarkation for one of the most important mining settlements, called Papan, the Kinta is joined by a large tributary, in volume nearly rivalling the Kinta river itself; this stream is called the Sungei Raya, which also drains an important tin district.\n\nIn the plain between the two rivers, a curious geological formation is found. The main ranges of hills all through P\u00e9rah are granitic, but in this valley principally, and to a small extent elsewhere, peculiar isolated limestone cliffs rise vertically out of the plains to heights varying from 500 to 2,000 feet; the greatest number of these hills, or rather I should say cliffs, are to be found between the Kinta and Sungei Raya; there are a few of them on the western side (right bank) of the Kinta river, and these are the limestones spoken of by Mr. Deane; one\u2014Gunong Pondok\u2014well known as a steering point to all mariners making for the L\u00e2rut river, exists on the eastern side of the pass in the Gunong Bubo range, the road from L\u00e2rut to Kwala Kangsa passing the foot of it. A number of these cliffs also exist between the Sungei Raya and the Kangsa river, of which I will speak directly, but further to the East they are not to be found, nor, I believe, to the South, as I have never met them nor heard of them in Sel\u00e2ngor, although I saw a good deal of that country while in the service of the Sel\u00e2ngor Government. Like all limestone formations, these cliffs are pierced by caves in all directions, in which large colonies of bats have lived for countless ages, depositing a species of guano (tai kalawi) largely used as manure in the Province Wellesley, where it is brought from K\u00e9dah, in which this limestone formation is again met. The peculiar feature of this rock is the high state of crystallisation in which it exists, no fossils of any sort have yet been found in it, that I am aware of, although I have frequently searched for them, nor can any marks of stratification be traced; the rock is generally pure white occa-\nsionally with a slight shade of grey, blue, or red in it, and, when broken, exactly resembles a piece of lump sugar. The same limestone formation is, I believe, also to be found in Borneo. Some of the richest deposits of tin are found about these cliffs, and probably other minerals will be found when they are properly examined; two of the best ores of iron (brown hematite and specular iron ore) are common. Hot springs also exist. To the naturalist and botanist this district is full of interest; that magnificent butterfly\u2014the ornithoptera Brookani\u2014formerly supposed to be peculiar to Borneo, is found plentifully in several places. It is almost needless for me to add that the presence of limestone is a pretty certain sign of good soil. A marble saw, worked by water power, might produce marble slabs for paving the ground floors of bungalows for little more than the cost of transport, which, being by water the whole way, would be trifling; and the difference between a marble pavement and the red tiles commonly used in the Straits needs no remark. Before speaking of the hill district to the East of this, it will be well to mention the means of access to this district.\n\nThe easiest way is by water. A coasting steamer, the Pyah Pekhet, calls every week at Durian S\u00ebbatang, a place about 40 miles up the P\u00ebrak river, on her way to and from Singapore and Penang. From Durian S\u00ebbatang to K\u00f4ta Bahru, the future seat of Government in this district, is from two to three days by native boats; the river is only practicable for a steam-launch at present for a short way, in consequence of the number of snags in the stream, but these will be removed as soon as the river is low enough to admit of the work, the money being already granted by the Government for the purpose. From K\u00f4ta Bahru the Kinta is navigable for two days more by native boats to a place called M\u00ebsjid L\u00e2ma and the Sungei Raya about the same distance to above Pengkalan Bahru, both places in the centre of the limestone country. When I speak of these rivers being navigable I mean for boats of over a koyan, say two tons, burden.\n\nThe first attempt to visit the high hills beyond these points was undertaken last August, when Messrs. Christie and Handyside, the pioneer Ceylon coffee planters, visited this district. When they told me that their object was to see the mountain country of the interior, I was at a loss which of the many routes to adopt, all being equally unexplored by any one but Malay gutta-cutters and the\naboriginal inhabitants of the hills, the Sakeis. The highest hill to be seen from here was said by the natives to be the one in which the Kinta took its rise, I therefore determined that the simplest way to get there was to follow the course of the river. The diary which I kept during the trip was subsequently published by the Straits Government, and from it I extract the following particulars:\n\nStarting from Tanjong Renkang, a place just above where the boats can come, which I mentioned just now (M\u0113sjid L\u0101ma), we reached a place called Kwala S\u2019mat as our first day\u2019s march. Here we left the elephants and proceeded on foot. Here we may be said to have just got into the hill country, the elevation by the aneroid being about 700 feet where we camped with the hills on each side of us. A little more than a day\u2019s march from this we passed the mouth of the Sungei P\u0113n\u014dh, a considerable tributary of the Kinta, which flows from its source about N.W. The elevation at its junc- ture with the Kinta is about 1,600 feet. Three days from starting we reached the foot of G\u016bnong Rayam, the hill for which we had been making, having followed a rather circuitous route, keeping close to the river the whole way. No where along the way were any obstacles to making a road or tramway encountered.\n\nFrom this point it took us the best part of a day to reach shoulder of the first peak, where we encamped at an elevation considerably over 4,000 feet. From here we obtained a magnificent view. It was, however, a bad camping ground, as we were a considerable distance above water and had left the forest below us; the vegetation here consisted of flowering shrubs, ferns, and mosses, and it was with difficulty that we found a tree sufficiently large to support our tent. From this point Mr. Christie and I, with three or four Sakeis, started for the top the next morning, expecting to get there in about an hour, but on coming to the first peak we saw several others beyond, and it was after 3 p.m. when we reached the last. As the Sakeis could give us no name for it, we called it G\u016bnong Robinson, after His Excellency the Governor, and as there was no prospect of getting a view in consequence of the mist, and being hungry and cold with no water between us and the camp, we beat a precipitous retreat to the camp. We made the height of G\u016bnong Robinson nearly 8,000 feet.\nFrom the foot of G\u00fbnong Robinson we struck more to the South-west than the South, by which we had come, crossing the Sungei P\u00eanoh, at an elevation of about 2,500 feet, with hills on both sides of us, up to 5,000 and 6,000 feet. The Ceylon men were in raptures with the soil about here. From this we continued in a South-westerly direction till we reached the Sungei Raya and followed the course of that river to the plains. This is all that is at present known of this extensive tract of forest extending to an indefinite distance to the East at an elevation of from 2,000 or 3,000 feet up to 7,000 or 8,000 feet; that it extends a long way further was evident from the volume of the streams draining it.\n\nAfter leaving the Sungei Raya, the next navigable river met with to the East is the Kampar, flowing past the foot of G\u00fbnong Bujang Malaka. This was the hill on which Mr. Handyside began his first clearing, attracted to the place not so much by the soil as by the facilities afforded by a navigable river to the foot of the hill. Mr. Handyside's attempt proved a miserable failure, as might easily have been foreseen; ignorant of any eastern language but Tamil, he took a gang of twenty newly arrived Chinese coolies without an interpreter up on the mountain; with them and some assistance from the Malays and Sakeis he managed to fell about eight or ten acres of forest in the height of the wet season, when it was impossible to burn it; the solitude of his life and the semi-mutiny of his coolies, with whom he could not exchange a single word, was too much for him, and his health and spirits completely gave way, and when Mr. Smith and I visited him early in January we found him in a most desponding state of mind, wishing he could find some one to buy his concession and reimburse him for his outlay; the offer was too good to be pressed, and Mr. Smith at once closed with it. This partly led to the second expedition to the hills. Mr. Smith, having now obtained a large grant of land, determined not to fix on a site to commence operations till he had seen more of the country. The Government was anxious to obtain more information about the unknown country to the East, so I was commissioned to organize an expedition to the eastern frontier of P\u00e9rah, and with that object Mr. Smith and I, with eight elephants and a string of followers, started from Kwala Kabul, a place about three miles South of B\u00fbjong Malaka on the Kampar river, on the 25th March last. Before going any farther, I should mention that the Kampar river is a large tributary of the Kinta, joining the latter river a short way\nbelow K\u00f4ta Bahru, of which I have already spoken. The Kampar is navigable for one-koyan boats to the foot of Bujang Malaka, and this hill, or rather I should say short range, can be reached by native boats from Durian S\u00eabatang in about two or three days, according to the state of the river. To the North-west of Bujang Malaka, the Kampar receives a large tributary, the Sungei D\u00eepong, which flows for the East, while the Kampar itself appears to take its rise near the South of G\u00fbnong Robinson. A good view of this country is obtained from the highest peak of Bujang Malaka, about 4,200 feet; from there the D\u00eepong valley is seen stretching away about twenty or thirty miles to the East, while the course of the Kampar is lost in a labyrinth of high hills to the North, more than a quadrant of the circle of mountain and forest lying between them.\n\nHere I may also mention that G\u00f4peng, the most important mining centre on this side of the country, employing 700 or 800 Chinese, is situated at the southern base of the range separating the Sungei Raya from the Kampar; it is about 4 miles\u2019 distance from each of them. To the North of G\u00f4peng the mountains begin at once; to the South, about eight miles\u2019 distance, is K\u00f4ta Bahru. The hills to the North of G\u00f4peng, as well as the Kampar valley, have not yet been visited by an European.\n\nStarting, as I have already mentioned, from Kwala K\u00e2bul or the Kampar, it took us two days in a south-easterly direction through primeval forest almost the whole of the way, to reach the Chindariong river, a navigable stream draining the eastern side of Bujang Malaka and separating Bujang Malaka from hills of about the same height to the East. These hills and those forming the valley of the Dipong are comparatively thickly inhabited by Sakeis, the aboriginal hill tribes of the country. Wherever I have come across these people, and they are to be met in the valleys of all the rivers to the East and North of this, I have remarked that they are confined to a zone extending from 500 to 1,500, or perhaps 2,000 feet; the reason, I imagine, for their not going higher is that probably the crops which they cultivate, hill-padi, tapioca, and occasionally a little tobacco, will be found not to thrive above these elevations; this is only surmise, but, if it proves correct, may be a guide to future planters as to the alteration in temperature at different elevations. An account of these people has yet to be written, and, if well done, will be a most valuable work viewed from an anthropological point.\nThey possess a language of their own, and, I imagine, are not all of the same race; although closely allied to the Malays, physical differences certainly exist between the tribes inhabiting different valleys, and the common idea that they wander at large all over the hills is certainly a mistake; each particular tribe keeps exclusively to its own valley and is frequently at feud with its neighbours on either side; their habits are migratory in their own districts, but unless when compelled by the oppression of the Malays, or other causes, they seldom leave their own valley. One curious custom they have. When one of them dies the corpse is buried in the house he died in, and the whole party forsake the spot, going off to some other place not very far off. I have been told that in this way they will occasionally abandon their standing crop, but I will not vouch for the truth of this. They live in groups of from eight or ten to as many as twenty or even thirty, but seldom more. Like all savage races they will undergo great privations, and can subsist on very little; when food is abundant they are most improvident of it, but they can never starve, as the jungle abounds in fruits and roots on which they will subsist. As regards animal food, all is grist that comes to their mill\u2014rats, snakes, pigs, or anything they can get. Almost their only weapon consists of a blow-pipe about seven or eight feet long, from which they shoot poisoned darts with great accuracy as much as thirty or even forty paces; a single dart is sufficient to bring a bird or monkey down in a couple of minutes; they say that if they can hit an elephant or a pig in the eye a couple of darts will do the job, but they generally get pigs and deer by an ingenious spring made of the branch of a tree with a bamboo spike fixed to the end of it; the spring is held in a bent position by a bit of jungle cord, which, when touched, releases it and the spike, eight or ten inches long, is buried in the animal. The existence of these spring traps makes it advisable always to be accompanied by a Sakei guide when moving about in their country. Their marriage customs are very simple; the intending bridegroom presents the father of the bride with a few presents, such as a brass pot, a knife, a piece of red or white cotton cloth, some fruit or rice; and if deemed satisfactory, the bride and bridegroom separate from the remainder of their friends and spend the honeymoon by themselves away in the jungle. The ordinary attire of both sexes consists of a piece of bark cloth, in the case of the males seldom sufficient for decency; the females are a little better; some of the younger women have good figures, and in many cases magnificent busts, but through frequently becoming mothers long before\nthey have grown to maturity all trace of beauty is lost; like all eastern women they age very fast and become frightful old hags.\n\nCleanliness, as well as godliness, are both conspicuous by their absence in this race, the only ablutions they ever perform is when they are caught in the rain, which happens as seldom as they can help; if the rain comes on they can get a shelter erected in ten minutes, and a fire in about the same time, and then they all sit huddled together as close as they can pack till the rain clears off. They have no conception of a God, nor have they a word in their language either for God or devil; the fact, however, of their burying a cooking vessel, and a knife and other articles of the sort, with their dead, would seem to point to their having some hazy notion of a future state. It would be rash of me to make any statements of the difference of race in different parts of the country, seeing how little I know of these people; but so far it appears to me that the prevailing type to the North, that is, the Ulu Kinta, Sungei Raya and Kampar, is rather darker than the Malay, and perhaps smaller, certainly more spare and wiry, while away to the South and East, about the Slim and Songkei, of which I will speak directly, they appear a better developed and a fairer race. The northern tribes appear to have a long, narrow cast of countenance, with straight lank hair, whereas those to the South have rounder faces, broader noses and lips, and enormous bushes of hair sticking out over their heads, sometimes as much as eighteen inches in diameter all round. Another distinctive feature of the eastern Sakeis is a habit they have of piercing the cartilage of the nose in the males and wearing a piece of wood about a quarter of an inch in diameter, and about six inches long, thrust through it. A few who affect to be dandies ornament their nose sticks by different devices cut on them and decorate their faces and chests with stiles of charcoal. The Slim Sakeis are certainly physically a remarkably fine race of people.\n\nWherever I have seen these people, nearly the whole of them, I should say quite ninety per cent., were suffering from an unpleasant skin disease (Kurop); they are frequently covered with it from head to foot. Their uncleanly habits and irregular feeding are no doubt the cause of this. All races with any pretence to civilisation have stated hours for feeding, but these people eat at any time, or every time, the limit not being when they are satisfied so much as when the food procurable is finished; in this respect\nresembling the lower animals. It is a mistake, I think, to imagine that they are incapable of improvement, as I believe some people suppose. The French Missionaries in Malacca have not, I believe, been very successful with the Jak\u00fans, probably a family of the same race, but this may be because they have attempted to do too much at once. About the Bidor I saw a large number of these people, who had almost entirely adopted the Malay customs and habits, and this will probably be the eventual fate of the race when their present haunts are occupied by settlers; they will become gradually blended with the natives of the country.\n\nI think I have now said enough to satisfy any one taking an interest in these primitive races that they could not find many better places to study them than here, and if so I shall have fully effected my object.\n\nFrom Chindariiong it took us one day to reach the Batang Padang river, a large and swift stream. We came on it at a place called P\u00falau Tiga and followed its course up stream to a large village called T\u00e1pa, where we spent a day. While at T\u00e1pa we visited the place where the headman (P\u00ebng\u00fblu) lived, called Kwala Br\u00fbmun, and between the two places came upon mica schist rocks in several places. I have found pebbles of this rock in nearly all the other streams, but this was the first time I have seen it in situ in P\u00e9rak. The vegetation undergoes a change here; along the banks of the stream and for a short distance in on either side, a large species of bamboo grows to the exclusion of everything else. I have seen similar growths of these bamboos in other places, but not to the same extent. The land here appears to be exceptionally rich, the largest sugar canes I have ever seen were here.\n\nThe hills begin just above Kwala Br\u00fbmun, and this would be a very good starting point for any one wishing to explore them, as there are lots of Sakeis about here who could be got to act as either guides or coolies; in the latter capacity they are infinitely preferable to any other race, they will carry heavier loads faster than either Klings or Malays.\n\nT\u00e1pa is the place of embarkation (Pengk\u00e1l\u00e1n) for a number of extensive tin mines almost entirely worked by Chinese. The tin ore\nis first separated from the pig dirt and is then subjected to a second washing, when a quantity of gold dust is obtained. The amount is variable in different mines, and it is impossible to get trustworthy statements on the subject from the Chinese; there is no doubt, however, that the quantity is considerable, the quality is inferior; I imagine it is alloyed with the tin with which it is found, being of a very pale colour; extracted simply by washing, no doubt a good deal is lost; were mercury used no doubt more would be obtained.\n\nLeaving T\u00e2pa, travelling in a south-easterly direction through the gold fields, we reached the Bidor in a day. This is another navigable stream which joins the Batang Padang a short way before they fall into the P\u00earak river at Durian S\u00ebbatang.\n\nThere is not much tin worked on the Bidor, and it is not more than half of the volume of the Batang Padang, and dividing into two streams of about equal size just above where we crossed it. I do not imagine that it can drain nearly so extensive a tract of country.\n\nOn both these rivers (the Batang Padang and the Bidor), but more especially on the latter, we saw large numbers of the Sakeis living in comparatively speaking permanent houses, and to a great extent conforming to the customs and habits of the Malays.\n\nFrom Bidor it took us two days to reach the Songkei, the last important tributary of the P\u00earak river in this direction.\n\nThe output of tin from here is not large, as compared with the rivers further West, but the quantity of gutta is proportionally greater; the supply, however, in the more accessible districts is beginning to fail. It is a matter worthy of careful consideration whether cultivating the better class of gutta-producing trees would not be a profitable undertaking, the first cost of planting would be the only outlay, as once started the trees would be able to take care of themselves.\n\nThe Songkei district is noted for the quantities of fruit grown there, the groves of durians were the most extensive I have ever seen. It is but thinly inhabited at present, but appears at one time to have been a populous place.\nHaving crossed the Songkei, our route still lay in a south-easterly direction, and it took us two days to reach the river Slim; our rate of travelling was very slow, as elephants are not used in this part of the country, and, although the path was sufficiently good, there was not sufficient headway, and the mahouts had to stop every few paces to cut away the branches of the trees.\n\nThe first day after leaving the Songkei we were much impressed by the luxuriance of the Bertam palms. The climate is evidently exceptionally moist about here, to judge by the quantity of moss and ferns we saw. About the middle of the first day from the Songkei we reached the Sungei Tr\u00f4la, a tributary of the Slim. We had now, therefore, left the watershed of the P\u00earak river. This will therefore, I think, be a good point to make a break in this Paper, which is extending itself beyond the limits I at first intended.\n\nIf this account proves sufficiently interesting to the members of the Society for them to care for any more of it, I will continue the account of our trip to the Slim and back to the Batang Padang through the hills.\nABOUT SLIM AND BERNAM.\n\nPART II.\n\nIn the first part of this Paper I have endeavoured to give some idea of the south-eastern district of P\u00earak as far as the river Songkei, being the most easterly affluent of the P\u00earak. The next river met to the East after leaving the Songkei is the Tr\u00f4la, which falls into the Slim, which again falls into the Bernam, the next rain-basin South of the P\u00earak river.\n\nThis Sungei Tr\u00f4la is a considerable stream, which only needs to have the snags removed to make it navigable for boats up to half a hoyan; at present the smallest canoe cannot get through it.\n\nWhere we crossed it, at a place called Kampong Tr\u00f4la, there is a colony of trading Malays settled, which has been here for the last four or five years; they came originally to collect gutta and other jungle produce, and liking the look of the place have settled permanently; these men, like most other foreign Malays in the peninsula, come from the Dutch colonies, and whatever else may be said of the Dutch rule in Malay countries, it appears to make traders and colonists of the people under its influence.\n\nAfter leaving the Tr\u00f4la about two and a half miles, the path passes through a pass about 400 feet high; in it I noticed a peculiar sort of friable soil, of a buff colour, which, when pressed in the hand, crumbled down into flakes about the tenth of an inch thick. The name of this pass is Gapis.\n\nA few miles beyond Gapis the path passes some hot springs, the geological formation of which puzzled me a good deal, as in the immediate neighbourhood of the springs the rock was evidently stratified, although apparently metamorphosed to a great extent, and con-\ntorted in a most extraordinary way; and fifty yards away from the springs all round the ordinary granitic formation prevailed. From the cursory observations I was able to make, it appeared to me that these springs formed the apex of some irruptive force, although a stratified rock underlying the granite appeared strange. I am unable to give the temperature as I had no thermometer registering high enough, but the heat was too great to have the hand in the water; there was a decidedly sulphurous smell in the neighbourhood, and I also saw a good deal of a bright green filmy matter adhering to the stones in the water similar to what I have observed at the hot springs amongst the limestone hills in the Kinta valley, but whether it is of a vegetable or mineral origin I was unable to determine.\n\nImmediately after leaving the hot springs, the road lay among a number of small hills, the offshoots apparently of higher hills to the North, and here, for the first time, Mr. Smith appeared thoroughly satisfied with the soil, although to my uninitiated eye there was not so much difference between it and lots of other soil we had passed; I, however, bow to his opinion on the subject of soils, as I know nothing about them.\n\nAfter leaving the low hills I have just spoken of, the path runs through a broad belt of gigantic bamboos, after which the river Slim is reached. Just opposite the mouth of a tributary of it called the Galetin, a prettier view than the one that here met our gaze I have not often seen, and it was one that I was not prepared to find; fruit trees and houses bore testimony to a considerable population and an old kampong.\n\nCrossing to the left bank of the Slim, our route lay nearly due North for about three quarters of a mile, till we reached Kampong Chan'kat, where the P\u00eang\u00fblu Toh Sempuh lives.\n\nHere I remained for a day transacting some business with the people. Immediately opposite the kampong, about a quarter of a mile from the river, there is an extensive hot spring, or rather I should say group of springs, hotter than any I have yet met with in P\u00earak; they can be recognised from a distance by the clouds of steam rising over the trees, and standing on the edge a man can scarcely be seen on the opposite side through the vapour.\nAfter a day's rest Mr. Smith and I separated for a short time: he starting to visit a hill up the valley of the Galetin, while I went down the river to see the kampongs and the people, intending, if possible, to visit some deposits of coal, which are said to exist about here. The first part of my programme was most successful, as I saw a number of very flourishing kampongs, all, with one exception, on the East (left) bank of the river; these kampongs are situated on spots of high ground surrounded by stretches of wet padi land irrigated by a number of small streams flowing from the hills to the East. The large majority of the inhabitants are foreign Malays, principally Mand\u00e9lings, and their style of cultivation is certainly superior to that of the Malays in other parts of P\u00e9r\u00e1k, for which they reap their reward in the crops they get. The average yield, they tell me, from the wet padi land is of 800 to 1,000 gantangs of padi to the orlong, this, be it remembered, from land cultivated year after year without manure.\n\nThe lowest kampong on the Slim is Kampong Pindras, and here I was to have got guides to take me to the coal deposits, but when I got there, the man, a Sakei, was away, and others who said they thought they knew the road, stated that it would take them two or three days to find it, so, as I had no time to spare, I gave up the hope of finding the coal, and contented myself with a specimen which I got from the Pengulu. This is, I think, unmistakably coal, of an inferior quality no doubt, but good coal is not often found on the surface. If the Sarawak coal mining proves a success, it might tempt some enterprising capitalist to commence operations here, the facilities for transport offered by a navigable river are not to be lost sight of.\n\nThe Slim, as far as Kwala Galetin, is navigable for boats of over a koyan. I saw one there when I passed that had come from the Kwala Bernam to buy rice, a decided sign of prosperity when the people grow more food than they consume. In no other part of south-eastern P\u00e9r\u00e1k is this the case; it must, however, be borne in mind that tin-mining is the principal industry on the other rivers, and that no tin has been worked on the Slim since the disturbances consequent on the murder of Mr. Birch, not through the failure of the mines, but because the miners were obliged to leave at that time, as the blockade prevented their getting supplies brought up to them. When peace was restored, Raja Asal, who was the leading\nspirit of these miners, got certain concessions at Papan, on the West of the Kinta river, and all the miners followed him there, where, they say, the ore is more plentiful, but more difficult to work.\n\nAs I failed to reach the coal deposits, but was part of the way to the Bernam, I determined to visit that river, the southern boundary of P\u00e9trak before returning to the Ulu Slim. One day's march from Kampong Blit, where I spent the night, took me to Kampong Bernam, it was however a most fatiguing journey, although we went in the lightest marching order; the small forest leeches (pachat) were more numerous than I ever saw them before. On the way we crossed two considerable streams, and a number of small ones, tributaries of the Slim: the first, Sungei Bil, was a mountain torrent full of rocks; the second was a navigable river, the Sungei Berong, on which a colony of foreign Malays have settled, and appear to be in a very thriving condition; where they are settled the country is flat, and they cultivate a good deal of wet padi.\n\nAfter leaving the Berong we crossed the spurs of some high hills to the East before reaching the Bernam at Kampong Bernam. The distance from Kampong Chankat on the Slim to Kampong Bernam, I estimate at about twenty miles. I did not chain this distance, but have been able to plot it approximately by the time and compass bearings.\n\nKampong Bernam is a large village on the northern side of the river, said to contain about eighty families, nearly all foreign Malays, who came as traders and have settled permanently. The attraction which first brought them here was the tin-mining, which, as I have already mentioned, has ceased on the P\u00e9trak side since Raja Asal left. There are still extensive tin-mines being worked on the southern (the Selangor) side of the Bernam, but I was told there are fewer miners now than there used to be.\n\nFrom Kampong Bernam there is a well used path leading to Pahang; the gradient is said to be easy most of the way, but there are two or three places where the path is impracticable for elephants, i.e., tame ones; it is a curious fact, well authenticated, that wild elephants can pass places where tame ones cannot. Buffaloes are frequently brought by this pass from Pahang into P\u00e9trak and\nSelangor. I was told that it is about two days' journey from Kampong Bernam to the first Malay kampong in Pahang. A road through either this or some of the other passes into Pahang would bring a good deal of traffic over to the western side, as the transport by water from a navigable point on the Bernam or Slim is shorter and easier than by the Pahang river; moreover the ports on the western side of the peninsula are always open, whereas on the eastern side they are closed for six months of the year by the North-east monsoon.\n\nI was told by the people both at the Slim and the Bernam that at present a steam launch can go up the Bernam to a place called Chankat Mentri, to which point the river is tidal. The ordinary country boats can reach that point in three tides; from Chankat Mentri to Kampong Bernam on the Bernam river, or the Kwala Galetin on the Slim, is about three or four days' poling. The freight at present charged from Kampong Bernam to the sea is $1 per bharu for tin, which is not excessive.\n\nFrom Kampong Bernam can be seen a hill to the North-east, which at this point is the much talked of back-bone range; the Bernam rises on the South of it, draining the south-western face, the Berong takes its rise on the North of this hill, draining the north-western face of it. The Sungei Berong falls into the Bernam, a short distance above the Kwala Slim.\n\nOn my return to Kampong Chankat I made the acquaintance of the Pengulu, who was absent when I first arrived; his name is Datoh Sempuh; he is an old man, but full of energy, one of the finest specimens of Malay I have ever met. Unlike the generality of his countrymen, who have seldom or never been beyond their own immediate neighbourhood, he has wandered over the whole peninsula, from Siam to Johor, and has commemorated his visit to each country by marrying a wife there; he told me the names of his wives, but broke down at about nineteen when trying to count the number of his children; he speaks Sakai fluently, and possesses great influence with these people. I found him an invaluable guide and companion on my return journey. For any one wishing to explore the still unknown mountain regions of the peninsula, or to study the habits and customs of the Sakais, a better guide could not be obtained than Toh Sempuh.\nI should mention here that, on my return to Kampong Chankat from the Bernam, I found Mr. Smith, who had arrived before me. He had ascended the valley of the Galetin for some distance, and then climbed one of the hills to about a height of 3,000 feet by the aneroid. He was simply in raptures about the soil, which he compared to that of Ouva, the best coffee district in Ceylon. The numerous rocks and boulders he met also pleased him, as he, in common with all the coffee planters I have met, has an unaccountable, hankering after rocky land. He also got a few small specimens of plumbago, with which he was much pleased, as he said it is also found in the best land in Ceylon, although I confess I do not see what planters want with plumbago any more than rocks.\n\nAnother feature which both of us noticed, and which it appears augurs well for the soil, was the comparatively small size of the timber; the best timber is said to grow on poor soil.\n\nAfter stopping for a day at Kampong Chankat to enable Toh Sempuh to collect a number of Sakeis, we paid a visit to Bat\u00fb Gaja, the boundary point in the pass between the Slim and Pahang. This was a two days' journey, one out and one back, and proved a most interesting trip. We started in the morning from Kampong Chankat, and keeping a northerly course along the left (East) bank of the Slim for about two miles, reached the confluence of the Sungai Brus\u00ea and the Slim. The Brus\u00ea is a considerable tributary of the Slim, flowing down the Bat\u00fb Gaja pass in a direction about South-west; up this valley our course lay. We kept some distance above the river on the North side of the valley, constantly crossing small streams flowing down the side of the hills into the river at the bottom. The ascent though steady was gradual the whole way, it was what I have heard very expressively described as \"collar work\" all through. We took the elephants a considerable distance and then only left them as we could get on more quickly on foot. The path was a good one and well worn, and we passed several parties of Malays coming and going from Pahang.\n\nThe name of this pass, Bat\u00fb Gaja, is derived from a stone in it on the right hand side of the path, which bears a fanciful resemblance to an elephant kneeling down as they do to receive their loads; the head is deficient and is said to have been removed to the Ulu Bil, a river that I have already mentioned, by some\nmysterious agency in former times. This stone is addressed as the Toh Gaja, and every one passing is supposed to pluck a handful of grass or leaves, and striking Toh Gaja seven times on the breast with them, to ask him for fine weather for the journey; this ceremony we religiously performed, and having some people in the party familiar with elephants, we were enabled to choose food such as these animals like, and were rewarded by not getting any rain till we returned to Kampong Chankat. The idea about these leaves is that no matter how many are offered in a day the next day no trace of them remains.\n\nThe elevation at Batu Gaja, according to the aneroid, was 2,500 feet; this is not actually the highest point in the pass, which is about 200 yards further on, perhaps 50 feet higher. Immediately after crossing the pass a little trickling water is met, which, I was told, was the first beginning of Sungei Sembilan, a tributary of the Pahang river.\n\nTwo hills rose on either side of the pass for at least another 1,000 feet: that to the North is called Gunong Petri, the southern one I could not get a name for. No view was to be obtained from the pass, as everything was hidden by a dense growth of gigantic bamboos, which appeared to extend to the summits of both the hills North and South of us. These large bamboos appeared to thrive in most of the Slim and Songkei hills, and I have seen a good many of them up the Kinta valley. Different planters express different opinions of them; in Ceylon, I believe, bamboo land is discredited; in southern India it is thought the best; \"doctors differ, &c.\" The state of the weather, the hour of the day, and many other causes appear to have a marked influence on the nature of the soil; whatever the cause, no two planters whom I met appear to agree; query, does any of them know anything about it?\n\nIn this pass I saw the footprints of wild elephants, where, I should have thought, few animals but a goat could have gone, most certainly no tame elephant could have been taken there.\n\nThe return journey from Batu Gaja was uninteresting, as we merely retraced our footsteps. When I reached Kampong Chankat Toh Sempuh told me that at Batu Gaja we should be com-\nparatively close to some gold and tin mines in Pahang, although when I asked him at that place he said they were still more than a day's journey distant; he explained himself by saying that these mines being in Pahang, beyond his jurisdiction, he was afraid that I would have wanted to go there, and had anything happened he would be blamed.\n\nThese gold mines at the Ulu Pahang are spoken of as being exceptionally rich. I heard stories which were quite incredible of the quantities of gold dust got in a short time. One fact is well known, that Pahang gold is of very fine quality, in this respect differing from Perak gold, which is very pale. A good deal of gold and ivory is said to pass westward from Pahang, and I met a trader at the Slim who made no secret that he had just returned from Pahang, where he had been negotiating for the purchase of tin to be taken down the Bernam river.\n\nAfter returning from Batu Gaja a couple of days were spent in collecting coolies and making preparations for our journey back; these preparations consisted chiefly in buying rice, padi was procurable apparently in any reasonable quantity, but some delay occurred in pounding out the rice.\n\nSakeis are the coolies here, in fact they take the place of elephants further North as beasts of burthen. Physically they are a remarkably fine race, much fairer and more robust than the Kinta and Kampar Sakeis.\n\nRaja Bila, a Mandeling man, and the head of the traders in the Kinta district, who accompanied me, was formerly engaged working tin here, and he informed me that his people had no difficulty in getting Sakeis to carry rice up to, or tin down from, the mines, which I subsequently ascertained were about fourteen or fifteen miles distant at an elevation of over 2,000 feet; the established rate was thirty cents per fifty catties up or down, consisting usually of a slab of tin down or ten gantangs of rice up, when Malays carried they were paid in coin, Sakeis usually took their pay in kind\u2014cloth, tobacco, &c.\n\nWhen we started for the journey back our party consisted of thirty-two all told, including some female Sakeis, who appeared as willing and able to carry a load as the males. The track took us\nalong the right (western) bank of the Slim; for the first three miles we just skirted between the wet padi fields, and the foot of the hills; after this we began to rise gradually along a ridge, our course continuing pretty nearly North; after reaching an elevation of some 2,000 feet, we descended about 600 feet, and camped for the night on the bank of a tributary of the Slim called Sungei Kudin.\n\nThe following morning we crossed this stream on a Sakei bridge\u2014a fallen tree\u2014by no means pleasant work; we were encouraged by being told that a man broke his leg crossing here some time ago with a slab of tin on his shoulder; another 100 yards further on, the Slim itself had to be crossed in the same way. After this, ascending to an elevation of about 2,100 feet, we came on an extensive tableland drained by a number of little streams formerly used by the tin miners.\n\nAs we came along, a hill was pointed out to us some two or three miles to the East, which could not have been less than 4,000 or 5,000 feet high, called Gunong Dandan, said to be at this point one of the joints in the back-bone range.\n\nSome four or five miles further on, we again came on the Slim, which we had not seen for some time; it was here reduced to very modest dimensions, it did not take us much more than ankle deep wading across it. The country about was comparatively flat, with hills a few miles off, apparently some thousands of feet higher than we were. I made the elevation at our camp 2,200 feet by the aneroid. Mr. Smith was very much pleased with the soil, and some Sakeis, in whose clearing we encamped, gave us some roasted ubi kayu, which were remarkably good. Sakeis are the only people who know how to cook these roots; they roast them in a joint of bamboo split longitudinally; when done they come out as white and floury as the best murphy I ever saw.\n\nUp to this I did not notice much change in the vegetation from that seen in the plains; there was rather an absence of large trees, but the bamboos were exceptionally fine, some as much as four or five feet between the joints and six or seven inches in diameter. Mr. Smith pronounced favourably of the soil, and what appeared to me to be an immense advantage was that it would be possible to grow coffee here without being condemned to everlasting treadmill, climbing up and down hill,\nAfter leaving the Slim we made a short day's march to the Sungei Kudin, a tributary of the Slim, on the bank of which we had encamped two days before. Here we must have been within a very short distance of the frontier, judging from the size of the stream; this, however, is an uncertain guide, as we were told that we should have a long day's march the following day without seeing water. This would be a fine country for road making, apparently very dry, with plenty of stone for metalling.\n\nThe following day, as we had been told, we saw no water, but the Sakeis were always able to get enough for drinking in the joints of the bamboos; from a single joint I have seen as much as half a pint taken. There is also a sort of large vine from which, when cut, the water flows in a stream. This day's march took us through some very pretty country if it were cleared, but at present there is no more to be seen at an elevation of 4,000 or 5,000 feet than there is in the plains, the jungle being so dense. We crossed the water shed of the Slim and the Songkei to-day; the elevation was about 4,000 feet. Here our troubles began. As soon as we left the Slim valley our Sakeis declared that they did not know the way and wanted to go back. By great difficulty I was able to persuade part of the gang to remain with us, and we were obliged to encamp for three days before Songkei Sakeis could be got to replace those who had left us. None of our Slim Sakeis had ever been beyond this before: so much for the supposed migratory habits of these people. Here I may remark, that any one wishing to explore these mountain regions must work out one valley at a time. The Malay headmen lower down can always provide guides familiar with their own valley, and in it their topographical information is to be relied upon; attempt to leave it, however, for the next valley, and you are at once brought to a dead lock. The Sakeis not infrequently are at feud with their neighbours on either side, they have also a very wholesome dread of a very ingenious sort of spring armed with a bamboo spike, which they are in the habit of setting in the paths for pigs and deer, and which would be pretty sure to be fatal to a man if it struck him.\n\nAfter a weary delay of three days we at last got guides, and crossing the Songkei travelled round the southern face of a hill called Gunong Sandor. We passed along the face of the hill at a general elevation of about 3,000 feet; we were a long way from the\ntop. Here we saw a peculiar feature of the soil, which is so porous that the streams running down the face of the hill all run underground; during a long day's march we did not see a drop of water although constantly crossing water courses in which we frequently heard the water running under our feet. In some of these water courses the bed of the stream was marked by a succession of holes, at irregular intervals, about six feet in diameter and nearly as much deep, where the underground streams had made caves and the superincumbent earth had fallen in.\n\nWe encamped on G\u00fbnong Sandor for one night, near a Sakei clearing, and here we saw a very ingenious arrangement by which they got water; they got large bamboos which they split and removed the obstacles at the joints, they then shoved these shoots into the side of the hill in a nearly horizontal direction till they reached the water bearing strata when the water trickled from the end of the bamboo in abundance for drinking; bathing was a tedious operation.\n\nAfter leaving G\u00fbnong Sandor to our East we got into the valley of the B\u00eedor river, where we had more delay in getting fresh guides. I was particularly struck by the marked falling off of the Sakeis as we advanced West. To the East they are taller, more robust and fairer than the average Malay, but as we got West, towards the rivers B\u00eedor and Batang Padang, they degenerated very rapidly, becoming smaller and darker than the Malay. The idea conveyed to my mind from the appearance of the people in the different places was that the Slim Sakeis were a well-fed, healthy race, whereas the B\u00eedor and Batang Padang Sakeis had a miserable half-starved appearance.\n\nBy the time we got into the B\u00eedor valley and got guides, we found that, in consequence of the unavoidable delays and damage through rain, our supply of rice was nearly finished, and there was scarcely anything else left; the time I had originally proposed to be away had already been exceeded, and most of the party had had very nearly enough of camping out in the wet, and some of them showed unmistakable signs of breaking down; I therefore determined that the shortest road back was the best; in consequence of this we were unable to visit any of the hills at the sources of the B\u00eedor and Batang Padang, only skirting along the lower slopes of those hills at elevations of less than 1,000 feet. In the hills in\nthis country it is almost impossible to get a view except now and then when the explorer comes on a Sakei clearing; all the other parts of the hills are so densely clothed in forest that forty or fifty yards is generally the range of view; from two or three clearings, however, I saw some very lofty hills about the source of the Batang Padang, apparently the loftiest of these is one called Gunong Raja, said to be one of the vertebrae of the back-bone range. It appeared to be distant over twenty miles; and Sakeis said it would take three days to reach it, and another day to ascend. Where we passed the Bidor it was broken up into three streams, none of them of any great size, I therefore have come to the conclusion that the Bidor river does not drain any of the loftier hills in the interior; its drainage is confined to the smaller outlying spurs, and the rivers in this part of the country, which have their rise in the true watershed of the peninsula, are, beginning from the West, first the Kinta river, next the Kampar river, next the Batang Padang, next the Songkei; I do not speak of the Plus on the North-west, or the Slim and Bernam on the South-east, as they belong to different systems of drainage; the Plus to the Upper Perak drainage, the Slim to the Bernam drainage. Taking the four rivers mentioned above as the principal arteries of the Lower Perak drainage the next set of secondary streams are the Raya between the Kinta and the Kampar, the Dipong and the Chenderiang between the Kampar and the Batang Padang, and the lastly the Bidor between the Batang Padang and the Songkei.\n\nIn the foregoing paper I have endeavoured to give a general idea of this interesting and little known section of the kingdom of Perak, containing large deposits of minerals, only needing intelligence and capital to work them to advantage, and also offering exceptional advantages in the way of transport, soil and salubrious climate to planters of coffee, tea, and other tropical produce.\nTHE ABORIGINAL TRIBES OF P\u00caRAK.\n\nBY\n\nW. E. MAXWELL.\n\n(Read at a Meeting of the Society, held on the 13th October, 1879.)\n\nThe wild tribes of the peninsula being Kafirs, or infidels, it is the privilege of their Malay neighbours, who are Mahomedans, to capture and make slaves of them whenever they can do so. The adult Sakei or Semang has no market value; he is untameable and is certain to escape to his native woods and mountains. Children of tender age are generally sought for; they grow up ignorant of the language of their tribe and of the wild freedom of the forest, and have, therefore, little inducement to attempt to escape. In P\u00earak, K\u00ebdah, and on the borders of Pat\u00e2ni, I have met Sakei or Semang slaves in bondage among the Malays, sometimes children, sometimes adults, the latter having passed their childhood in servitude. They are not unkindly treated, but the mere fact that children are liable to be carried off into slavery is quite enough to account for the distance which the aborigines generally put between themselves and the Malays. An investigation which has resulted in the severe punishment of six Malays found guilty of dealing in Sakei children in Ulu P\u00earak has lately, it is believed, struck a death-blow at this practice, as far as the State of P\u00earak is concerned. No less than seven children were recovered in various Malay villages by the exertions of the Police. Some difficulty was experienced in\ngetting into communication with the tribes from whom they had been stolen, but eventually five men came down to the British Residency at Kwala Kangsa charged by the mothers and other relations of the missing children to take them back. Most of the children had been taken from their relations by men of their own or other tribes, most likely at the instigation of the Malays, to whom they were afterwards sold. Among the Malays they are worth from thirty to forty dollars apiece. A Pat\u00e2ni Malay confessed to me, some years ago, that he cultivated the acquaintance of some Sakei jinak, (tame Sakeis, who mix with the Malays) because he could get them to steal children for him. For a few trifling articles, which seemed to the savage to be untold wealth, the latter would start off to procure an unlucky infant with whom to pay his creditor. Sometimes, the Malay told me, a man would be away for two months, eventually bringing a child snatched from some tribe at Ulu Kelantan or Ulu Pahang.\n\nThe men who came down to the Residency at Kwala Kangsa were of different tribes. In Ulu Perak the Semangs and Sakeis of the plains seem to mix, both being distinct from the orang bukit or Sakei bukit, the men of the mountains, who are described as being fairer and better-looking than the others.\n\nI greatly regret that circumstances did not permit me to have, these people under observation for more than one day, and that my notes regarding them are, therefore, necessarily meagre.\n\nThe names of the five men are Kota, Bancha, Bunga, Beling and Naga. Kota is a Semang, and so far civilised that he adopts Malay dress when he visits a kampong. The others wore a chawat, or waist-cloth, of some cotton material purchased from the Malays, not the back chawat, which I have seen in the Kinta district. They do not all belong to the same tribe, and do not all speak the same language, though able to communicate freely with each other. A vocabulary was supplied to me by Kota. The other men gave signs of dissent several times when he gave his version of the word wanted, but the list was made late at night, and I had no time to take down several equivalents of the same word. I hope, on some future occasion, to be able perhaps to do so. The skin-disease remarked by most travellers, who have had an opportunity of observing the aborigines of the peninsula was noticeable in all\nof these people. One of them had brought his blow-pipe and poisoned darts with him, and willingly exhibited the manner of using them. The dart is dropped into the muzzle of the weapon and allowed to fall down to the mouth-piece, where a piece of some soft substance resembling fungus is inserted, in order that none of the force of the air may be lost. The mouth-piece is taken into the mouth, not merely applied to the lips. A small bird on the leaf of a cocoanut tree was the object aimed at. It was not struck, but the silent operation of the projectiles was evinced by the manner in which the intended victim remained in its place, while dart after dart passed close to it, evidently unconscious that it was being aimed at. I had always regarded the blow-pipe as a breech-loader and was somewhat astonished to see the darts inserted at the muzzle and shaken down through the tube. I should mention, however, that the marksman was in perfectly open ground. In the forest this method of loading has obvious disadvantages.\n\nAs an illustration of the superstitions of these people and their belief in, and dread of, the powers of evil, I may state that a message reached me from some of the headmen of a tribe in Ulu P\u00e9rah stating their unwillingness to receive back two of the children known to be at the British Residency. Both were believed to be the inheritors of evil-spirits (pelisit or bajang), which had possessed their fathers. The father of one of them had actually been killed by the general consent of the tribe in consequence of the numerous cases of sickness and death which had occurred in a particular place, all of which were traced to the pelisit, which was believed to possess him. The man chosen to carry out the sentence was the brother of the doomed man. His child was sold to Malays from fear that the pelisit, compelled to change its quarters, might have found a dwelling place in her.\n\nThunder, I was told, is greatly dreaded by the wild tribes, When it thunders the women cut their legs with knives till the blood flows, and then catching the drops in a piece of bamboo, they cast them aloft towards the sky to propitiate the angry deities.\n\nSinging and dancing are arts which are not unknown among the aborigines, though, as may be supposed, they are still in a very early stage of development. Dancing is confined to the female sex, which was not represented among the Sakei visitors at the Residency.\nbut of their music and singing, I had a fair specimen. *Bersempul* is the word by which the P\u00earak Malays describe a gathering of Sakeis for music and dancing. (It does not appear to have been known to the compilers of Malay dictionaries).\n\nSitting together in a circle and facing inwards, the five men commenced a series of long chants or recitations in quick time. The instruments on which they accompanied themselves were made of pieces of bamboo. One held two short lengths or tubes of bamboo (green and recently cut) in an upright position on a horizontal wooden log, one in each hand. These were raised and then brought down on the log alternately, producing a ringing and not unmusical sound, which had something of the effect of the beating of a tom-tom. Two others beat pieces of bamboo held in the left hands with other pieces held in the right, after the manner of the Malay *cherachap*. There was no hesitation or difficulty about recollecting words; the man who led was followed by the other four, who were generally about a note behind him. The general result was monotonous, the performers sometimes chanting rapidly on the same note for nearly a minute together. Their whole range did not exceed three or four notes, I imagine.\n\nThe first song was the *Lagu Gias*, or song of the *Gias* tree. This was an enumeration of fruit-bearing trees, and of the favourite mountains and forests of the Sakeis. It is said to be held in great veneration, and may contain the germs of the traditions of this singular people. Next came the *Lagu Chenaku*, or song of the tiger-spirit. *Chenaku* or *Blian* is the Sakei name for the man who, under the semblance of human form, conceals his identity as a tiger, better known by the Malay word *Jadi-jadi-an*. Belief in this form of lycanthropy is widespread among the Malays as well as among the aboriginal tribes. The next song was the *Lagu Prah*, or the song of the *Prah* tree, sung when the *Prah* fruit is ripe, no small occasion of festivity among the forest tribes. The fruit (the nature of which I do not know) is sliced up and mixed with other ingredients (*rojak*) and then cooked in lengths of bamboo (*lemang*).\n\nThe performance concluded with the *Lagu Durian*, a song in praise of the *Durian* fruit. This like the others was unfortunately unintelligible to me, but it may be presumed that the Sakei estimate of this fruit is a high one.\nThe men received a few trifling presents, and went away in great delight. It was explained that what they principally fear in visiting inhabited places is the ridicule and contumely heaped upon them by the Malays. This is not astonishing, for at Sungei Raya in the Kinta district, I was a witness, a few months ago, of the kind of treatment Sakei men and women sometimes receive in a Malay kampong. A Sakei man followed by two or three girls (above the average in good looks, judging by a Malay standard) who had come to see the P\u00ebng\u00fblu, was literally hooted by all the small boys of the kampong, who ridiculed his accents, his dress (or rather his want of dress), his walk, and everything belonging to him. From this state of things it follows that for trustworthy accounts of Sakeis one must seek out the tribes in the forests and adopt a line of original enquiry. Stories about Sakeis, received second-hand from the Malays, are seldom worthy of implicit credit; the aboriginal tribes are interesting to the Malays only so far as they are useful agents in clearing jungle, procuring gutta, or assisting in the more questionable pursuit of child-stealing.\nTHE VERNACULAR PRESS IN THE STRAITS.\n\nBY\n\nE. W. BIRCH.\n\n(Read at a Meeting of the Society, held on the 30th Jan., 1880.)\n\nNo mention has as yet been made in the Society's journal of the recent appearance of a Vernacular Press in this Colony, and a brief notice of its rise and progress may have some interest.\n\n2. Towards the end of the year 1876 an association, entitled the \"Jawi Peranakkan\" (Straits born), established a Malay printing office and began the publication of a weekly newspaper under that name.\n\n3. Later on a Tamil Paper\u2014the \"Tangai Snahen\"\u2014was issued by the same publishers: it is a fortnightly periodical, has been in existence for some two years, and has now reached a circulation of about 150 copies.\n\n4. About the same time efforts were made by others to produce both Malay and Tamil newspapers; a Tamil Paper having been brought out prior to the publication of the \"Tangai Snahen,\" and two Malay Papers subsequently to that of the \"Jawi Peranakkan,\" but these have, after a short run, died out, and the \"Jawi Peranakkan\" and the \"Tangai Snahen\" are, at the present moment, the sole representatives in Singapore of the two languages.\n\nThe names of the two Malay Papers referred to as having existed for a short period in Singapore were the \"Peridaran Shamsu Walkamer\" (\"The Revolution of the Sun and the Moon\"), and the \"Bintang Barat\" (\"Western Star\").\n5. These Papers had for some time a sister in Penang\u2014the \"Jawi Standard\"\u2014but it fared the same fate, and is no longer issued.\n\nStrange to say, though the Tamil population in Penang is larger than that in Singapore, no Tamil Paper has as yet appeared.\n\n6. The project has often been discussed of starting a Chinese newspaper, but it has never got any further. The Chinese of Singapore would not appear to have had sufficient interest in the matter, or perhaps sufficient knowledge of the Chinese language to induce the projectors to carry out their scheme.\n\n7. The \"Jawi Peranakkan\" claims to be the first Malay newspaper ever published. It has now a circulation of some 250 copies, and appears to fulfill the useful function of a \"highest reader\" in all the vernacular schools.\n\nThe price charged for it is 30 cents per copy, or $5 per annum: it appears every Monday, and is ably and punctually edited, having, with only one exception, been issued consistently on the day on which it professes to come out.\n\n8. For the first year the proprietors adhered to the favourite manuscript writing and lithograph, but Malay type having been obtained from England, the Paper has, for the last two years, been printed, and the style is clear and easy.\n\n9. Its object is to give to its readers the latest news, both local and foreign, thought likely to prove interesting: and it is amusing to mark how closely it follows the English Press in placing all procurable war news before the public.\n\n10. In matters political it would seem to express opinions of its own, endeavouring at the same time to form those of its readers.\n\n11. Towards Government its tone is not hostile, nor even critical; indeed in only one instance was anything like a burst of feeling given vent to: it was in the case of the recent \"Holidays Ordinance,\" when not unnatural indignation was expressed at no holiday being allotted to the great Mahomedan festivals of \"Ramzan Eed\" or \"Haji Eed.\"\n12. The paper is surprisingly free from all personalities, excepting in letters having reference to Mahomedan customs of religion and law (Adat); not infrequently, however, passages occur with those ironical allusions well known to Malays as \"Sendi'ran.\"\n\n13. From a literary point of view it will doubtless tend to settle the language and to give an uniformity to the various dialects of Malay, an object which the original projectors claim to have had in view. Its influence can scarcely fail to be considerable on the written language.\n\n14. The \"Jawi Peranakkan's\" agents are numerous, and hold their agencies in London, Penang, Malacca, Klang, Kwala Kangsa, Johor, Deli, Padang, Batavia, and Sarawak.\n\n15. In order to give an idea of the actual character of the Paper, and the manner in which it is edited here, a short resum\u00e9 follows of the contents of a late number of the \"Jawi Peranakkan,\" bearing date the 12th of January, 1880.\n\n16. It is a small paper arranged in columns very much in the style of English newspapers. It commences by quoting the present state of the market, devotes a column or so to advertisements, by which, however, it is said not to make more than $60 per annum, and proceeds to give in full a Government Circular (English and Malay) detailing the management of the Malay College at Telok Blanga, and exhorting Malay Rajas and others to make more use of the College.\n\n17. Of the next para., a translation is appended, which reads as follows:\u2014\n\n\"The Hekayat Abdullah has been re-printed by the members of the Asiatic Society, and is exceedingly clearly done; whoever now wishes to buy it can obtain it from the officer in charge of the library at the Museum adjoining the Raffles' Institution.\"\n\n18. The paper then touches on the recent death of the Datoh Klana of Sungei Ujong while on his return from a pilgrimage to Mecca. It appears that the Datoh, having accomplished his pilgrimage and having lost four of his followers, was returning to Jeddah when he was overtaken by death at a resting place near the latter town.\n19. A reference at some length is next made to the Moar disturbances and to the action of an honourable gentleman in respect of them. The writer points out the contrast between this gentleman's activity on behalf of Tunku Alam, and the Tunku's sluggishness in respect of his own right: rebuking him in the tone of a philosopher, and hinting that he should make himself more acquainted with the outside world and its doings.\n\n20. Next comes the correspondence column, which contains a letter from a correspondent in Malacca narrating the running amuck (Mengamok) of a Malay on board the Japan, and the consequent wounding of sixteen persons. The majority of letters addressed to the Editor are written with the intention of giving pieces of local news not likely to be otherwise communicated, of exposing some disreputable character, of relating some wonderful adventure or phenomenon, and of eliciting information upon various subjects often abstrusely grammatical.\n\n21. The principal notices from the Government Gazette are then copied, as also are extracts from other papers referring to events in neighbouring countries: the first of these is taken from the Rangoon Times; it relates the discovery of sapphire mines in Siam, and discusses the probability of the Marquis of Lorne being made Viceroy of India.\n\n22. From the Straits Times some passages are quoted respecting the arrival of the French Flagships in Singapore, and the courtesy of the Admiral in allowing the Band to play on the Esplanade.\n\n23. Three columns are given up to a series of paragraphs giving news from Java and the adjoining Malay States, and it is worthy of notice that so large a number of places contribute news from this part of Malaya. Such names are found as Sem\u00e2rang, S\u00ebrubaya, Bogor, Peri\u00e0man, Men\u00e2do, Bant\u00e2n, Cherb\u00fbn, Amb\u00fbn, Kar\u00e2wang, and P\u00fblau Banda.\n\n24. Then come extracts from the London and China Express. About England there are paragraphs with Court and Parliamentary news, and a passing reference is made to the disturbances in Ireland.\nFrom France, Russia, Austria, Switzerland, Turkey, Egypt, the United States, Chili, and Peru various items of news are given.\n\n25. The Indian telegrams are next copied from the Straits Times, relating to the war in Afghanistan, and the paper is brought to a close with the latest telegrams of the week, referring, in this instance, to the Bolivian Republic, to Ireland, and to Russia.\n\n26. In the majority of cases journalistic terms are expressed by their English names written in Malay characters, or by their Malay equivalents, this being effected by a slight process of paraphrasing, but in some cases the Arabic equivalents of these technical phrases of journalism are employed such as:\n\nEditor ... Mualif ... \u0645\u0648\u0627\u0644\u0641\nSubscriber ... Mutaliah ... \u0645\u0637\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0629\nNotice ... Ahl\u00e1n ... \u0627\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0646\n\n27. There is another useful little work which is attributable to the \"Jawi Peranakkan\" Company, and it will not be out of place to notice it here: it is a Mahomedan and English Comparative Calendar, which shows at a glance the corresponding date in the Mahomedan table of reckoning to that used in our Calendar. This Table, sold at ten cents a copy, has, it is stated, a very large circulation.\nMISCELLANEOUS NOTES.\n\nON THE GULIGA OF BORNEO.\n\nThe Guliga, more commonly known as Bezoar, forms a recognised article of export from the Rejang and Bintulu rivers in the Sarawak territory. These concretions are chiefly obtained from a red monkey (a species of Semnopithecus), which seems to be very abundant in the interior districts of Borneo. A more valuable Guliga, called the \"Guliga Landak,\" is obtained from the porcupine, but it is comparatively rare. The Sepoys stationed at Sibu Fort in the Rejang formerly exported considerable numbers of these calculi to Hindustan, where, in addition to their supposed efficacy as an antidote for the poison of snakes and other venomous creatures, they appear to be applied, either alone or in combination with other medicines, to the treatment of fevers, asthmatic complaints, general debility, &c. A few years ago, however, these men ceased to send any but the Guliga Landak, since their hakims had informed them that the concretions obtained from the monkeys had come to be considered of very doubtful, if any, value from a medicinal point of view.\n\nThe usual test for a good Guliga is to place a little chunam on the hand, and to rub the Guliga against it, when, if it be genuine, the lime becomes tinged with yellow. Imitations are by no means rare, and on one occasion which came to my own knowledge some Bakatans succeeded in deceiving the Chinamen, who trade in these articles, by carefully moulding some fine light clay into the form of a Bezoar, and then rubbing it well all over with a genuine one. The extreme lightness of a real Guliga, and the lime test are, however, generally sufficient to expose a counterfeit Bezoar. The\nSepoys and Malays apply various imaginary tests. Thus they assert that if a true Guliga be clasped in the closed fist, the bitter taste of the concretion will be plainly susceptible to the tongue when applied to the back of the hand, and even above the elbow if the Guliga be a good \"Landak;\" and a Sepoy once assured me that having accidentally broken one of the latter, he immediately was sensible of a bitter taste in his mouth.\n\nAccounts vary very much among the natives as to the exact position in which the Guligas are found: some saying they may occur in any part of the body; others that they occur only in the stomach and intestines; whilst I have heard others declare that they have taken them from the head and even the hand. Bezoar-stones are sold by weight, the gold scale being used, and the value varies according to quality, and to the scarcity or abundance of the commodity at the time of sale. The ordinary prices paid at Rejang a few years ago were from $1.50 to $2 per amas for common stones, and from $2.50 to $4 per amas for Guliga Landak. I have seen one of the latter which was valued at $100. It was about the size of an average Tangiers' orange, and was perfectly spherical. The surface, where not artificially abraded, was smooth, shining, bronze-brown, studded with numerous irregularly-shaped fragments of dark rich brown standing out slightly above the general mass of the calculus. These fragments, in size and appearance, bore a close resemblance to the crystals in a coarse grained porphyritic rock.\n\nThe common monkey-bezoars vary much in colour and shape. I have seen them of the size of large filberts, curiously convoluted and cordate in shape, with a smooth, shining surface of a pale olive-green hue. Mr. A. R. Houghton once showed me one which was an inch and-a-half long, and shaped like an Indian Club. It was of a dirty greenish colour, perfectly smooth and cylindrical, and it had become aggregated around a portion of a sumpitan dart, which appears to have penetrated the animal's stomach, and being broken off short has subsequently served as the nucleus for the formation of a calculus. The same gentleman had in his possession two Landak stones, one of which bore a close resemblance to a block in shape, and was of a bright green colour, and the second was of a rich chocolate brown, and could best be likened in form to a Constable's staff. One porcupine stone which was opened was\nfound to be a mere shell full of small brown shavings like shred tobacco.\n\nThe part of the island which produces these stones in greatest abundance seems to be, by a coincidence of native reports, the district about the upper waters of the Balu\u1e45gar (Batang Kayan). The story is, that the head waters of this river are cut off from its lower course by an extensive tract of hills beneath which the river disappears, a report by no means unlikely if the country be, as is probable, limestone. The people of the district have no communication with the lower course of the river, and are thus without any supply of salt. In lieu of this necessity they make use of the waters of certain springs, which must be saline mineral springs, and which the Kayans call \"Su\u1e45gan.\" These springs are also frequented by troops of the red monkeys before mentioned, and the Bezoars are most constantly found in the stomachs of these animals, through their drinking the saline water. The hunters lie in wait about such springs, and, so runs the report, on the animals coming down to drink, they are able to guess with tolerable certainty from external signs which of the monkeys will afford the Guliga, and they forthwith shoot such with their sumpitans. I have this account, curious in more ways than one, from several quite independent sources.\n\nIn concluding these brief notes, I may remark that the widespread idea of the medicinal virtue of these concretions would lead us to suppose that there is some foundation for their reputation.\n\nA. Hart Everett.\n\nOn the Name \"Sumatra.\"\n\nIn a volume recently added to the Society's Library\u2014\"Notes on the Malay Archipelago and Malacca, compiled from Chinese Sources\"\u2014Mr. W. P. Groeneveldt says (p. 92): \"The three preceding articles beginning on p. 85 give the name of Sumatra to the northern part of the island which is now entirely called by this name. In this case the name is certainly taken from the\ncapital or principal settlement on the coast. Marco Polo, who visited Sumatra in 1290, speaks of Samara, which probably is the same place, as the difference in sound is easily explained by the circumstances under which Polo's book was written. Ibu Batuta (1346) correctly calls it Samathra, or Samuthra, and describes its situation nearly in the same terms as our author. As we know very little of the country yet, we are unable to determine the exact locality now, but we think that eventually the details given above will assist in doing so. It appears, however, that this place Sumatra was not situated on the spot of the present Atjeh, but more to the East, on one of the smaller rivers which fall into the sea there; this is proved beyond doubt by the fact that three smaller States were situated due West of it, before the Indian Ocean, on the western side of the island, was reached, the last of these three occupying the site of the present Atjeh, as will be shewn afterwards. We do not learn at what epoch Sumatra lost its importance and was supplanted by Atjeh; the time assigned to this event in the history of the Ming dynasty, translated just now, is certainly too recent, and we think that the latter part of this article does not apply to Sumatra, but to the new capital of Atjeh.\n\nOn p. 144, however, Mr. Groeneveldt says: \"On p. 92 we were still unable to determine the position of the old city of Sumatra; we might have spoken of Pasei, which is pointed out by native tradition as the principal place on the coast before it was supplanted by Atjeh, but we refrained from doing so, as we did not know how long it had occupied that position. Some new information has, however, been obtained since from a report of one of our functionaries who visited Pasei last year, and found there a village called Samudra, on the left bank of the river, about three miles from the sea. It is curious to observe that our informant, just as the Chinese traveller in p. 85, speaks of the heavy surf which is continually raging at the mouth of the river. Taking together these different indications, we do not hesitate to say that this village of Samudra is the remnant of the former capital of the country.\"\n\nWith regard to this extract, it may be pointed out that the account given in S\u00ebj\u00e2ra Mal\u00e2yu indicates with tolerable distinctness the position of the old city of Samudra; which, according to\nthe legend, was founded by Marah Silu (the younger of two brothers residing at Pasangan, about half way between Teluk Samawi and Samalangan, who afterwards quarrelled, on which the younger fled to the forest of Jaran and acquired the position of a Chief among the people there). The account of the circumstances leading to the foundation of the city are obviously mythical.\n\nBut from two or three passages the situation may be conjectured. In the account of the marriage of Sultan Malek al Saleh (Marah Silu) it states that he went out as far as Jambu Ayer (which lies between Tanjong Perlak and Kerti) to meet the Princess of Perlak. Again Perlak was conquered by enemies, and the inhabitants took refuge in Samudra, which shews those States to have been contiguous to each other. Malek al Saleh now founded Pasei; having previously crossed the river on a hunting expedition, he came upon an elevated piece of ground near the river, which he selected as the site for the new city. So that clearly the two cities of Samudra and Pasei were only a short distance from each other. In a later account of the quarrel between the brothers Sultan Malek al Mansur of Samudra and Sultan Malek al Zaher of Pasei, it states that the former left Samudra and went out to the mouth of the river, shewing that it was a city up a river, and it must be inferred from the passages already referred to that the river on which Samudra stood, lay between Samudra and Pasei, and was the only stream of any consequence that separated them. The clear inference then on the whole is that Samudra was a city a little way up a river lying somewhere between Pasei and Tanjong Perlak (Diamond Point); whether this inference from native sources is confirmed by the discovery which Mr. Groeneveldt mentions of the actual site, it is not easy to say; for Mr. Groeneveldt's account of this discovery is brief, and decidedly meagre geographically speaking; he says: \"one of our functionaries visited Pasei last year and found there a village called Samudra, on the left bank of the river, about three miles from the sea.\" Now though the Sejara Malayu has a great deal of fable interwoven with historical details, we can hardly doubt the fact of there being originally two distinct cities of Samudra and Pasei, however mythical the tale of their foundation, and Pasei and Samudra are mentioned interchangeably when speaking of the same circumstances, as though they were the same. According to the native account two brothers (already named) rule respectively over the two cities, but the account does not go very far.\nIt indicates, however, the rising superiority of Pasei, which gave its name to the whole country, while Samudra sank into insignificance. The question remains how does Samudra come to be up the Pasei river? If so, where is the old city of Pasei? Probably the river visited by the Dutch functionary was only one of the rivers in the country of Pasei, and the \"Orang Pasei,\" in the many changes that have occurred in all those countries on the East coast of Sumatra, may have lost their capital, and retreated to the river of Samudra. It would certainly be satisfactory to have this point cleared up one way or the other.\n\n---\n\nA Correction.\n\nMr. W. H. Treacher points out the following error in the Botanical Notes contributed by him to the Society and printed in the last Number of this Journal:\n\n\"On page 60 of the third Number of the Journal, Mr. Murton remarks that I have given two descriptions of the Jelutong, which appear to him diametrically opposed. A reference to page 57, however, will show that this is owing to a mistake of the printer. The notes on that page refer only to the Table, and not to my description of the Jelutong.\"\nRainfall registered at the undermentioned Stations, in the Straits Settlements and the Native States, during the half-year ending 31st December, 1879.\n\n| STRAITS SETTLEMENTS. | NATIVE STATES. |\n|----------------------|---------------|\n| Province Wellesley.  | Sungei Ujong. |\n| Butterworth.         | The Residence.|\n| Bertram.             | The Hill Plantation.|\n| Bukit Minak.         | Klang; Selangor.|\n| Penang.              | K'wala Kangsa.|\n| Malacca.             | Thaipong.|\n| Singapore.           | Matang.|\n|                     | Kinla |\n\n| July     | August   | September | October  | November | December |\n|----------|----------|-----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| 5.60     | 8.82     | 5.04      | 14.96    | 8.37     | 10.15    |\n| 8.09     | 12.50    | 5.57      | 14.37    | 9.32     | 4.42     |\n| 12.54    | 6.88     | 12.07     | 17.87    | 9.08     | 7.68     |\n| 8.81     | 5.37     | 10.01     | 20.00    | 9.79     | 9.00     |\n| 16.69    | 9.76     | 5.43      | 22.30    | 4.38     | 7.50     |\n| 9.37     | 4.12     | 7.45      | 12.09    | 11.16    | 10.44    |\n| 10.52    | 4.61     | 9.65      | 32.40    | 10.49    | 7.47     |\n| 5.34     | 5.53     | 2.53      | 15.32    | 9.61     | 7.50     |\n| 8.69     | 4.48     | 2.00      | 12.78    | 10.56    | 10.55    |\n| 6.83     | 6.78     | 11.21     | 12.14    | 11.52    | 7.98     |\n| 8.41     | 4.60     | 4.95      | 10.96    | 10.33    | 10.56    |\n| 20.78    | 11.92    | ...       | 8.39     | 22.06    | 10.10    |\n| 8.41     | 8.82     | ...       | 28.78    | 8.66     | 10.10    |\n| 5.88     | 5.78     | ...       | 13.71    | 9.74     | 13.06    |\n|          |          | ...       | 14.25    |          | 14.97    |\n\nT.
