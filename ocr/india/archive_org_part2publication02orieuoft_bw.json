He said: \u201cThou hast had thy revenge,\u201d and after the idolater had departed to the regions of hell, he exclaimed: \u201cThanks be to God, who has caused thee to vanquish thy foe!\u201d\u2019 It is related of the above-mentioned A\u2019bdullah that he said: \u2018At the time when my mother was fighting around his lordship the refuge of prophecy\u2014u. w. b.\u2014she received a blow which made her blood flow abundantly. Therefore his lordship shouted to me: \u201cAid thy mother!\u201d\u2019 He also said: \u201cMay God bless you! You are of my family. Verily thou art better than such and such a one of my family. May God have mercy on thee!\u201d (Let it not remain hidden that Nasybah had A\u2019bdullah by Zayd B. A\u2019assum, who had been her husband before A\u2019dhar.) My mother said: \u201cO apostle of God, pray that in paradise I may be one of thy companions.\u201d Accordingly his lordship raised his blessed hands in supplication, and uttered the words: \u201cO God, make them my companions in paradise.\u201d My mother said: \u201cAfter that I cared for no calamity which might befall me.\u201d\n\nIt is said that Nasybah was present also in the battle of Yam\u0101mah, and it is recorded of her that she said: \u2018On the day of Yam\u0101mah I came to the battle-field with the intention to fight. My son was also present with me, and when the army of Moseyl\u0101mah the liar was put to flight by the army of Isl\u0101m, and had taken refuge in the \u201cgarden of death,\u201d which had before been called the \u201cgarden of the merciful,\u201d the Musalm\u0101ns pursued them, and a fearful struggle took place at the door of the garden, where Abu Dujjanah the Anss\u0101ri attained martyrdom. At last, however, the banner of Kh\u0101led B. Alwolyd, who was the commander of the army, had been uplifted, and the professors of Isl\u0101m threw themselves into the garden. I joined those happy warriors, and united with them in searching for Moseyl\u0101mah, but suddenly one of these miserable fellows\nstruck me with his sword, which severed my hand from my body. I swear by God that I returned to the battle in spite of that wound, and saw him killed after a short while, my son A\u2019bdullah standing near his head, and cleaning his sabre from his blood. On that occasion I offered my prostrations of thankfulness to God, and engaged in curing my wounds.\u2019 Some historians narrate that during the Khalifate of F\u00e0r\u00fbq a fine robe was brought into the assembly, and that those who were present said: \u2018O Amir, give this robe to Ssafyah, the spouse of thy son, for she is a new bride.\u2019 O\u2019mar replied: \u2018I shall send this dress to one who deserves it more than any other lady.\u2019 Then he despatched the garment to Omm A\u2019mm\u00e2rah, and said to the company present in that assembly: \u2018On the day of Ohod, when the army of Isl\u00e2m had been dispersed, his holy and prophetic lordship had been slightly wounded, but Satan exclaimed: \u201cMuhammad has been killed!\u201d Therefore the Musalm\u00e2ns were confused, and ran helter-skelter to Madinah, where the same news had spread, and the people, being terrified, were inclined to commit suicide. Some, however, went to Ohod, and the first man who recognised his lordship on the way was Ka\u2019b B. M\u00e2lek, who relates this interview as follows: \u201cThe eyes of his lordship were shining like stars, and I exclaimed: \u2018O ye Anss\u00e2r! this is the apostle of God sound and safe.\u2019 But the prophet beckoned to me to be silent.\u201d W\u00e2qidi relates that the prophet had put his cuirass on Ka\u2019b, and that of Ka\u2019b on himself. Ka\u2019b fought valiantly, and received seventeen wounds.\n\nWhen the companions knew that the apostle was alive they gathered around him from all sides. He proceeded to the pass of Ohod, and wished them to go to the mountain. A big stone was, however, in the way, to which he was unable to climb on account of fatigue. Accordingly Ttolhah sat down, and his lordship, placing his blessed foot on his back, stepped up to the rock, and said that Ttolhah had a claim to paradise.\nWhen the battle-field had been abandoned by the warriors of the age in conformity with the saying,\n\nDistich: When the valiant lion leaves the desert,\nThen the jackal becomes alert,\n\nHind with all the women of the advocates of hostility entered among the slain Musalmans, and excepting only Hanttalah\u2014the death of which happy individual has already been recorded above\u2014they ripped open the abdomen of every one of the killed, took out the liver, and having cut off the ears and noses of the martyrs, they made of them necklaces and bracelets for themselves. When the opponents were about to return to Mekkah, they wished to ascertain whether the prince of existences was among the living or the dead. Abu Sofyan approached the mountain, and shouted: \u2018Is Muhammad among you?\u2019 But by order of the prince of the favourites [of God] his companions gave no reply. He again exclaimed: \u2018Is the son of Abu Kohafah [i.e., Abu Bakr] among the people?\u2019 This time they also remained silent, and when he asked the third time for O\u2019mar, he likewise heard no answer, turned to his co-religionists, and said: \u2018All those whose names I called out have been killed, because had they been alive they would have answered.\u2019 At these words O\u2019mar lost his patience, and exclaimed: \u2018O enemy of God, thou hast lied! Those whom thou wouldst not have to live are still alive.\u2019 After that Abu Sofyan commenced to praise his idol, saying: \u2018Hobal is the highest.\u2019 And by order of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014the people replied: \u2018Allah is the highest and the most glorious.\u2019 Abu Sofyan continued: \u2018Honour we have, and you have none.\u2019 The companions answered by the command of his lordship: \u2018God is our Lord, and not yours.\u2019 Abu Sofyan said: \u2018One day for another, and battles are judicial decrees\u2019\u2014meaning that this day was a requital for the fight at Bedr, and that wars are prophecies, inclining the victory sometimes to one side and sometimes to the other. He also said: \u2018Your slain combatants have been dishonoured; not by my orders, but I am not angry at that. The next meeting between you\nand us will be at Bedr during the coming year.' The companions replied by command of the prophet: 'Let it be so.' After that Abu Sofy\u00e2n returned disappointed and hopeless to Mekkah with the army of aberration. His lordship, however, and his companions were apprehensive lest the idolaters might go to Madinah and plunder it. Therefore his lordship the apostle of men and demons ordered A'li Abu-r-ryh\u00e1n\\(^{288}\\) Bin Abu T\u00e2leb\u2014u. w. b.\u2014to follow them, and to bring correct information. On that occasion he uttered with his wonderfully eloquent tongue the words: 'If they are riding camels and leading their horses they are going to Mekkah, but if they are mounted on their horses and leading their camels they are marching to Madinah; and if they are going there I shall forestall and punish them.' A'li acted as he was bid, and brought the news that the idolaters were going to Mekkah.\n\nIt is related that when the rumour that the apostle had been killed spread in Madinah, Fattimah Zohra\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and a number of the ladies of the family hastily proceeded to the battle-field. When the apple of the eye of the Mussttafa\u2014u. w. b.\u2014saw her father with his teeth broken, wounded, and suffering, she wept. She embraced his lordship the apostle, who was also much affected. A'li B. Abu T\u00e2leb brought a jug of water, wherewith Fattimah washed off the blood from the face of that prince. It is said that although Fattimah tried much to stanch the blood of the apostle's wound, she was unable to succeed, until at last she found a piece of matting, burnt it, and stopped the blood by spreading the ashes of it over the spot.\n\nIt is related that when the idolaters returned to Mekkah, the Musalm\u00e1ns went in search of the wounded and killed. On that occasion his holy and prophetic lordship asked: 'What is the matter with Hamzah, that I do not see him?' Accordingly A'li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014went to look for him, and when he discovered his mutilated corpse he wept. He im-\n\n\\(^{288}\\) *I.e.*, 'Father of the two aromatic flowers,' meaning Hasan and Husayn.\nmediately returned and informed the apostle, who accompanied him in his own august person, and when he saw that Hamzah's ears and nose had been cut off, he became very sad and melancholy, and swore on oath that if he obtained an opportunity he would disembowel seventy of the polytheists. Then Jibrail descended, bringing the verse: 'If you have been punished, then punish them as you have been punished; but if you are patient it will be better.' Accordingly the apostle said, 'I shall be patient,' and gave up his intention.\n\nSome writers of biographies and of the sayings of the prophet relate that his lordship prayed over the corpse of Hamzah, and that every martyr brought was placed near the latter and prayed over, so that seventy prayers were recited over Hamzah. All the Ulama who have written histories on biographies agree that the martyrs were not washed, but interred in their blood-sprinkled garments. His lordship also ordered every corpse to be buried where it was found, so that any person who had carried away a dead body was obliged to bring it back. All those, however, whom the prophet loved were buried together in one grave. During the latter part of the day his lordship marched back to Madinah, and the men, together with the women of every tribe they passed through, rendered thanks for the safety of his holy and prophetic essence\u2014u. w. h.\u2014saying: 'Any calamity besides that of losing thee is trifling and easy to bear.' They spoke thus, although most of them were in affliction and mourning. When the apostle arrived at Madinah, he heard sounds of lamentation\u2014uttered by women\u2014issuing from the majority of the Anssar habitations; but hearing no voice issuing from Hamzah's house, he asked: 'Has Hamzah no women here to bemoan him?' When Sa'd B. Ma'adh and Asyd B. Khadzyr, with all the Anssar, heard these words, they said to their women: 'Go first to Hamzah's house and weep for him. Then return to your own domiciles and cry for your own relatives.' Accordingly the Anssar women went between evening and bedtime to the house of the apostle's uncle and lamented\nnearly till midnight. Then his lordship awoke from his sleep, and asked: 'What noise is this?' But being informed of the true state of the case, he said: 'May God reward you, your children, and your children's children!'\n\n**GHAZWAH OF HAMR\u00c2 ALASAD.**\n\nWhen the idolaters returned from Ohod, they repented having done so, saying to each other: 'What have we done? We have collected an army, we have taken trouble, we have killed some nobles and friends of Muhammad, but we have stopped short, and have not utterly annihilated him with his companions. Now we must return and do so, trying to extirpate them so as to free our minds from any further apprehensions about these fellows.' A'kramah B. Abu Jahl insisted on this point most of all, and Ssafuw\u00e2n B. Ommyah said: 'The calamity which befell Muhammad and his companions has greatly depressed their spirits, and so incensed them against us that if we return again, very likely the tribes Awus and Khazraj, which have lagged behind, will this time assemble and have a share in the battle, so that our enemies may possibly after having been conquered become our conquerors, and thus the tables would be turned against us.'\n\nWhen the news that the opponents intended to return had reached the exalted audition, the prince of the inhabitants of the world wished to throw fear and confusion into the hearts of the foes, and let them know that the professors of Isl\u00e2m had not lost their courage. Therefore on the day after the battle of Ohod, which was a Sunday, he caused Bel\u00e2l to shout the following notice: 'The apostle of God orders you to hasten and seek the enemy, but none are to sally forth on this business except those who were present on the battle-field of Ohod.' When the noble Moh\u00e1jer and the distinguished Anss\u00e2r heard the command of the apostle of God\u2014u. w. b.\u2014they girded up the loins of obedience, although they had received many wounds. His holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014\narmed himself and took up his position on the road, thus waiting for the professors of Islam to gather around him, and concerning whom the verse was revealed: 'Those who obeyed God and the prophet after they had been delivered, those of them who acted well, shall have a great reward.' None of the combatants remained behind except J\u0101ber B. A'bdullah, the Anss\u0101ri, who had a valid excuse. His lordship entrusted A'li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014with the flag [of command], but according to others Abu Bakr obtained it. Then he marched as far as Hamr\u0101 Alasad, and ordered five hundred fires to be lighted in the camp. On that occasion Mo'abd Khozaa'y\u2014who was a friend of his lordship, though he had at that time not yet made his profession of Isl\u0101m, his tribe having been allied to the prophet by oath and protected by him during the time of ignorance and of Isl\u0101m\u2014was travelling to Mekkah, and, meeting with his lordship, after condoling with him about the companions who had been slain, he continued his journey and encountered Abu Sofy\u0101n with all the idolaters, who asked him what news he had about Muhammad. Mo'abd replied: 'Muhammad has marched out from Madinah with a great number of those who have fought at Ohod, and intends to take vengeance on you; I have left the army at Hamr\u0101 Alasad.' The idolaters said: 'What words are these?' He continued: 'I swear by God that I am speaking the truth, and I think before you leave this place you will behold some of the cavalry of Isl\u0101m.' Ssafuw\u0101n said: 'What we were apprehensive of has been fulfilled, and it will be proper for us to leave this place, lest we be conquered after having been the conquerors.' This information made also a great impression upon the other idolaters, so that they marched in haste towards Mekkah. Mo'abd hereon immediately despatched a courier to his lordship to let him know what was going on. It is related that on the above occasion Abu Sofy\u0101n perceived a company travelling to Mekkah, and requested them to convey the news of his approach to his lordship the best of men. Accordingly when they arrived at Hamr\u0101 Alasad they delivered their message, but the Musalm\u0101ns replied:\n\u2018We trust in God, and a good advocate is He!\u2019 It is said that at Hamr\u00e2 Alasad the Musalm\u00e2ns took two men prisoners, one of whom was Abu U\u2019zza the poet, who had been captured [already] at Bedr, but was liberated after paying ransom, and promising not to fight again against the Musalm\u00e2ns. For having broken the just-mentioned promise and oath, his lordship ordered him to be killed in spite of all his entreaties, and said: \u2018No believer shall be stung twice from the same den.\u2019 And, turning to Abu U\u2019zza, he said: \u2018Thou shalt not return to Mekkah! Stroke thy unhallowed beard, and exclaim: \u201cI have played two or three tricks to Muhammad!\u201d\u2019 Accordingly A\u2019assum B. Th\u00e2bet despatched him with his sword by command of his lordship. The other prisoner was Moa\u2019wiah B. Moghirah, for whom O\u2019thm\u00e2n interceded, and his lordship said: \u2018For thy sake I remit his punishment, on condition of his stopping not more than three days in Madinah; but if he exceeds that time it shall be lawful for anyone to shed his blood.\u2019 And by the decree of Divine providence that doomed individual did not leave Madinah, but concealed himself on the fourth day for fear of death. Then his lordship the apostle sent O\u2019mm\u00e2r Y\u00e2ser and Zayd B. H\u00e2reth who pulled Moa\u2019wiah B. Moghirah out from the corner of secrecy and took his life.\n\nEvents of the Fourth Year after the Flight of His Lordship the Apostle\u2014U. W. B.289\n\nW\u00e2qidi relates that in the beginning of this year his lordship the apostle\u2014t. b. of G. b. o. h. and o. h. f.\u2014sent Abu Moslamah B. A\u2019bd\u00fb-l-asad Makhz\u00fbmi with one hundred and fifty companions, among whom were also Abu O\u2019baydah Jurr\u00e2h, and Sa\u2019d B. Abu Woq\u00e2ss and Asyd B. Khodzyr, to the country of the Bani Asad, the reason of which Seriah was as follows: It had reached the exalted audition that Ttolhah and Solmah, the sons of Asad, were instigating their followers to wage war against that prince, and that\n\n289 A. H. 4 began on the 13th June, 625 A.D.\nthey would possibly make a raid into the vicinity of Madinah. Therefore his lordship ordered Abu Moslamah to forestall and to plunder them in their own country. The just-named individual accordingly took Wolyd B. Zohayr Tayy for his guide, and marched with him until they reached one of the settlements of the children of Esriyl, all whose corn and quadrupeds they took, as well as some men, the remainder of whom fled to their people and informed them of the multitude and bravery of the professors of Isl\u00e2m. They also warned Qays B. H\u00e2reth and Ttolh\u00e2h B. Howildar not to meet the Musalm\u00e2ns. Accordingly all of them left their habitations, which the Musalm\u00e2ns then entered and plundered. There is, however, [also] a tradition that the Bani Asad were drawn up in battle-array opposite to Moslamah, and that after Sa\u2019d B. Abu Woqq\u00e2ss had sent one of the idolaters to the infernal regions he shouted to the army of Isl\u00e2m: \u2018What are you waiting for?\u2019 and that accordingly Abu Moslamah with all the Musalm\u00e2ns rushed upon the infidels, putting them to flight.\n\nThe Calamity at Rajya'.\n\nRajya\u2019 is the name of a water, belonging to a settlement of the Hodhayl, near which a misfortune befell the professors of Isl\u00e2m, in the following manner: When the idolaters returned from Ohod, Sofy\u00e2n B. Kh\u00e2led Hodhayli was going to Mekkah with a company of the A\u2019dzal and Qarah. They were congratulating each other on the loss the Musalm\u00e2ns had sustained, and conversing about Sol\u00e2qah the daughter of Sa\u2019d, the wife of Ttolh\u00e2h B. Abu Ttolh\u00e2h, who had been killed at Ohod, together with her sons. She had made a vow to give one hundred good camels to anyone who would bring her the head of A\u2019assum B. Th\u00e2bet. This promise stimulated the covetousness of Sofy\u00e2n B. Kh\u00e2led, and he despatched seven wicked fellows of his tribe to Madinah, who waited on the lord of existences, made a [false] profession of Isl\u00e2m, and represented to him that, a great many of their tribe having become\nMusalm\u00e2ns, it would be proper to send some companions to teach all the people the Qur\u00e2n and so ennoble them, by making them acquainted with the ordinances of the law. Those hypocrites were lodging in the house of A\u2019assum\u2019s father, cajoling him day and night to induce him to accompany them to their tribe. After several days had elapsed the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014appointed ten of his companions\u2014seven of whose names are in biographical works recorded as follows: A\u2019assum B. Th\u00e2bet, Mazyd Abu Mazyd, Habyb B. A\u2019dy, A\u2019bdullah B. T\u00e2req, Kh\u00e2led B. Alkabyr, Ma\u2019qob B. O\u2019baydah and Zayd B. Wotnah, but as the names of the three remaining individuals cannot be found in any copy they are omitted in this place also. In short, the Musalm\u00e2ns took their arms, started on their journey, concealing themselves during the day, and travelling in the night until they arrived near Hodhayl. In this place one of the seven hypocrites, who accompanied the ten Musalm\u00e2ns, left them, joined the tribe and informed Sofy\u00e2n B. Kh\u00e2led of their arrival, and that wretched hypocrite immediately proceeded with two thousand armed men to the above locality. When those ten fortunate men were going up the mountain the idolaters arrived, and that rogue who had carried the news of the companions to Sofy\u00e2n preceded and was advancing in front of the infidels. Then Kh\u00e2led B. Alkabyr said to A\u2019assum: \u2018Thy guests have deceived us.\u2019 The latter believed it and instigated the companions to attack the adherents of darkness. But when the opponents saw that the Musalm\u00e2ns were ready to fight they advised them not to expose themselves to be killed, and said: \u2018Do not attempt to bring on thy destruction, and that of all thy companions, for we have given and do give you quarter.\u2019 But A\u2019assum B. Th\u00e2bet, who had been appointed chief of his companions, was determined to attain martyrdom, and said: \u2018We are not afraid to be killed, because we are certain of our religion. I have sworn an oath not to accept quarter from any idolater, nor to shake hands with an infidel.\u2019 After uttering these words he began to shoot\nhis arrows, till he spent them all. Then he fought with his spear till it broke; he drew his sword, turned to the Qiblah of prayer, and said: 'Great God, I have fought for Thy religion in the beginning of the day; protect it and the end of it from the wickedness of my enemies.' This prayer he uttered because he had heard that Sol\u00e1qah, the wife of Abu Ttolhah, had made a vow to drink wine from A\u2019assum\u2019s skull, and when the latter actually attained martyrdom the idolaters meant to cut off the head of that blessed individual, to convey it to Sol\u00e1qah, and to take the camels with all the property of those Musalm\u00e1ns. But by a decree of Divine providence so many hornets gathered around the corpse of A\u2019assum that whoever approached it was fearfully stung. Accordingly the idolaters said to each other: 'We must wait till the night sets in and the wasps depart.' But when it was night God the Most Magnificent and Glorious sent a torrent which floated away the body of A\u2019assum, so that the idolaters were disappointed and saddened. And this is one of the most strange events. It is related that seven of the above-mentioned ten individuals fought against the idolaters till they attained martyrdom, and that three of them, i.e., Habyb B. A\u2019dy and A\u2019bdullah B. At-t\u00e2req and Zayd complied with their wishes and came down from the mountain; but the opponents broke their promise and tied their hands with bowstrings.\n\nWhen Ebn T\u00e2req beheld this treachery he managed in some way to disentangle his hands, to snatch up a sword, and to attack the enemies till he was at last sent by the stones of the infidels to the gardens of paradise. The idolaters carried Habyb and Zayd to Mekkah, and sold them to the Qoraish, who imprisoned them till the sacred months elapsed, and then crucified them both in a place called Tana\u2019ym. On that occasion Habyb asked the idolaters for permission to allow him to perform his orisons with two prayer-flexions: permission having been granted, he terminated his devotions, but uttered also a malediction upon the idolaters who had assembled at the foot of the gallows,\nwhich was afterwards fulfilled, and the majority of those present were shortly overtaken by a calamity. Habyb was suspended on the gallows in such a manner that his back was turned towards the Qiblah, whereon he exclaimed: 'It is no calamity to me to have my face turned away from the Ka'bah, since the Most High and Magnificent has said: \"Wherever you turn, there is the face of God!\"' Then they said: 'Renounce Isl\u00e2m, and we shall let thee go.' After his firm refusal to comply, they asked: 'Wouldst thou like to see Muhammad in this place?' He replied: 'I should not like even a thorn to hurt the foot of Muhammad.' They continued: 'We swear by L\u00e2t and by U\u2019zza that we shall kill thee unless thou renouncest the religion of Muhammad!' He rejoined: 'It is but a small thing to be killed for the cause of God!' and added: 'O God, I behold only enemies, and there is no friend to convey my greeting to Thy favourite.'\n\nZayd B. Aslam says: 'I was with a number of companions in the assembly of the prophet, when all of a sudden the signs of Divine revelation manifested themselves on the blessed countenance of his lordship, and after that he said: \"The Qoraish have slain Habyb, and this is Jebr\u00e2il, who has come to bring me his greeting.\"'\n\nWhen Habyb B. A\u2019dy refused to apostatize from Isl\u00e2m, one of the idolaters pierced him with a lance, so that it issued from his back, but he uttered the formula of monotheism and expired. It is said that he was the first individual who used to make two flexions at his prayers. When they brought Zayd to the foot of the gibbet he imitated the prayers of Habyb, and the idolaters used the same gibes also towards him which they had uttered to Habyb. Having received the same answer, they ordered the slave of Ssafuw\u00e2n B. Ommyah, to kill him, which was done. It is related that when Habyb B. A\u2019dy obtained martyrdom, he was left hanging on the gallows, so that the news spread among the tribes and reached also the prince of existences, who exclaimed: 'Will any one of you go and take down Habyb from the gallows, and thus obtain\nthe reward of paradise?' Accordingly Zobeyr B. Ala'wam and Moq\u0101d B. Aswad took this matter upon themselves, started on the journey, concealing themselves in the day, and travelling during the night, till they arrived one night in Tana'yam. There they beheld forty persons sleeping near the gibbet. They slowly took down Habyb, whose body they found to be still fresh after forty days, and on probing his wounds with their hands blood was yet flowing from them. Zobeyr then placed the corpse on his horse, whereon both friends started on their return journey. When it was day the Qoraish saw what had happened, and seventy of them sallied forth on horseback, in pursuit of the two fugitives, whom they overtook. Zobeyr, however, removed the body from the saddle and covered it with earth, wherefore those two blessed individuals were afterwards surnamed 'swallowed by the earth.' When the infidels were near, Zobeyr took off his turban, shouting out his name and genealogy, to show his readiness to fight. But as the idolaters perceived no utility in this contest they returned, and those two friends, traversing the distance, were exalted by being allowed to wait upon the prince of the righteous\u2014u. w. b. It is said that when they arrived Jibrail was present, and said to the prophet: 'O Muhammad, the angels are vying with these two companions of thine!'\n\nA'bduLLAH B. Anys goes and kills Sofy\u0101n B. Kh\u0101led \u2014The Curse of Allah be on him!\n\nSofy\u0101n B. Kh\u0101led Hodhayly had killed some companions, was trying to injure others, as has been related above, and was now engaged in gathering an army to attack the apostle of God. When a ray of this information had shone upon the forehead of the most enlightened mind, he appointed A'bduLLAH B. Anys to ward off the evil machinations of the wicked; but A'bduLLAH not being acquainted with Sofy\u0101n, he requested his lordship to describe him. The apostle explained with his wonderfully eloquent tongue his person and qualities, adding: 'Take\ncare, lest thou be afraid when thou seest him, and that Satan also be present at your meeting.' When A'bdullah departed he asked leave to speak whatever he liked. Being dismissed, he took up his sword, and after traversing the distance arrived in the Battin of Ghor\u00e2nah, where he perceived a man walking with several others. A'bdullah became afraid of that man, recognised him by that token, and said to himself, 'The apostle of God has spoken the truth!' When Sofy\u00e2n caught sight of A'bdullah he questioned him, and he replied: 'I am of the Khozaa'y, and I heard that thou art enlisting an army to fight Muhammad. It is my intention to serve thee!' Sofy\u00e2n replied: 'Yes, such is the case!' Then A'bdullah accompanied Sofy\u00e2n, recited poetry, and flattered him, so that the wretch felt amused, and when they arrived he entered his tent. When the night set in the friends of Sofy\u00e2n dispersed, every one of them courting sleep in his corner. Then A'bdullah entered the tent, and severing, with his sharp blade, the head of that tyrant from his body, he departed [with it] to Madinah. On the way he concealed himself in a cave, and God ordered a spider to weave its net over the entrance thereof. When the people of Sofy\u00e2n learnt what had taken place, they hastened after A'bdullah, but were unable to find him, and returned disappointed. A'bdullah then left the cave, concealed himself during the day and travelled during the night, until he reached Madinah. There he found the prophet in the mosque, and deposited Abu Sofy\u00e2n's unhallowed head at his blessed feet. His lordship the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and his companions rejoiced at the murder of the enemy of God; but some biographers consider the just-narrated event to have taken place in the third [year after the Flight].\n\n**Bara Moa'wiah.**\n\nThis misfortune took place as follows: Abu A'amer B. Malek, who was also surnamed Moll\u00e2bu-l-alsanah, arrived\n\n290 'Sport of the tongues.'\nfrom the tribe of Najd in Madinah. When he entered the august assembly of his lordship the prophet, that prince invited him to make his profession of Isl\u00e1m; but although he would not become a Musalm\u00e1n, he did not altogether refuse to acquiesce therein, and said: 'O Muhammad, I know that thy religion is noble, and thy sect is the orthodox one. If thou wilt send a number of thy companions with me to invite the Bani A'amer to accept Isl\u00e1m, perhaps the nation will enter the circle of obedience to thee.' His lordship rejoined: 'I do not trust the people of Najd!' Abu A'amer continued: 'Do not give way to misapprehensions, for I shall take them under my protection and not allow them to be hurt.' Then his lordship despatched seventy men, who were during the day engaged in drawing water and carrying wood, and during the night in prayer to [convert] the inhabitants of Najd. It is said that A'amer B. Khayrah and A'mru B. Ommyah Dhomayry were of the above number, over which his lordship appointed Mundhar B. A'mru Saa'dy as leader, and by whom he sent a letter to the Bani A'amer and grandees of Najd. When the Musalmans arrived at Bara Moa'wiah they alighted, and gave their camels to A'mru Bin Ommyah to pasture them; the letter, however, they handed to Haz\u00e2m B. Marjan, to give to A'amer B. Ttofayl, who was the brother of Moll\u00e1bu-l-alsanah's mother. Haz\u00e2m took charge of the letter, gave it to him, but by a preconcerted signal from A'amer, attained the honour of martyrdom whilst engaged in conversation. A'amer had [before] applied for aid to the Bani A'amer in his war against Mundhar B. A'mru, but as they [now] knew that Abu A'amer had taken the Musalmans under his protection, they did not comply with his request; notwithstanding this vile fellow gathered a number of the tribe of Salym and of O'ssyah, and of Dhakwan, and proceeded to Bara Moa'wiah. When the infidels arrived in that place they surrounded the professors of Isl\u00e1m, and when the monotheists saw themselves swallowed up in the vortex of calamity, they said: 'We see no one who might bear our\nsalutation to Thy favourite.' In short, both parties fought in that soul-melting battle-field, and contended with each other till the companions of the apostle attained martyrdom. When A'mru B. Ommyyah and H\u00e2reth B. Qohayny were returning from the pasture, they perceived birds soaring over the camp and dust rising over it. Accordingly they both mounted to an elevation to see what had become of their friends, but when they ascertained what had taken place A'mru said: 'It will be best for us to return to Madinah, and to inform the apostle of this misfortune.' But H\u00e2reth refused, went towards the infidels, fought, and sent two men of them to hell who had been aided by the idolaters. After these [idolaters] had spared his life, H\u00e2reth again commenced to fight, and slew two more men, till he at last also himself attained martyrdom. A'amer B. Ttofayl loosed the bonds of A'mru B. Ommyyah, and allowed him to depart to Madinah.\n\nWhen A'bu B\u00e1ra became aware of his nephew's treachery, he was so grieved that he fell sick and departed to the next world. There is a tradition that when his lordship received the news of the slaughter of his companions he pronounced during the space of forty days maledictions in his morning prayers upon the men of those tribes which had aided A'amer B. Ttofayl, and also upon the latter, saying: 'God requite A'amer!' Accordingly that wretch was in the house of the woman Sahilyah overtaken by a disease like the camel-plague, so that he exclaimed in his affliction: 'I feel an odour like the odour of death in the house of Sahilyah!' Thereon he called for his horse, mounted it, and departed to hell in that state of his unhallowed soul\u2014the curse of Allah be upon him! It is related that when A'mru B. Ommyyah Dhomayry was delivered of his bonds and proceeded to Madinah, he met on his way two idolaters of the Bani A'amer, who were under the protection of his lordship; but A'mru knew nothing thereof, and slew the two unlucky men while they were asleep. After traversing the distance he arrived in Madinah, entered the assembly of his holy and prophetic\nlordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014explained the manner in which the companions had been killed, and also how he had despatched those infidels; with the murder of these, however, his lordship was not pleased, and, blaming A'mru, compelled him to pay the blood-ransom to their heirs.\n\n**Ghazwah of the Bani An-natzyr.**\n\nWhen A'mru B. Ommyah had unwittingly killed those two individuals of the Bani A'amer, his lordship the apostle said: 'I must pay the ransom for them.' As the Bani An-natzyr were allies of the Bani A'amer, and had likewise made a treaty and covenant with his lordship, he assembled some of his companions, such as Abu Bakr, O'mar, Ali and Ttolhah. Then he proceeded to the habitations of the Bani An-natzyr to make arrangements concerning the ransom to be paid for the two slain men. When the apostle of Allah had arrived at the spot and explained the case, they replied: 'O father of Q\u00e2sim, we shall do as thou liktest. Stop awhile that we may fulfil the duties of hospitality.' Therefore the apostle of God took up a position leaning with his back against the wall of a house, and his companions reposing opposite to that prince. On this occasion Ebn Akhtt\u00e2b exclaimed: O ye Jews, such amity between you and Muhammad can never be established. The best is that a man throw a stone from this roof upon his head, that we may be freed of his importunity.' A'mru Hajash replied: 'I shall take that matter upon myself.' Soll\u00e2m B. Mashkam had, however, warned them not to do any such thing, because Muhammad, he said, would receive information from heaven, and the affair would cause the alliance between the nation and Muhammad to be cancelled; but the people would not listen, and at that very moment Jebr\u00e2\u00eel arrived and made his lordship aware of their treachery. Therefore the apostle rose and departed from the place, as if going to answer a call of nature, without informing his companions, and proceeded to Madinah; for he knew that as long as his sacred person was left untouched his friends\nwould likewise be left in safety. When the Jews became aware of his lordship's departure, Kan\u00e2z said: 'O people, do you know why Muhammad has left the assembly?' They replied: 'We know it not, and swear by God that thou likewise art not aware of the cause.' He retorted: 'By the truth of the Torah,\\textsuperscript{291} I know God; and the Most High has apprised Muhammad of your intention. Do not deceive yourselves. Muhammad is an apostle of God, and the seal of prophets\u2014u. w. b. You thought the seal of prophets would be of the sons of H\u00e2run, but the Lord and Giver of all good gifts bestoweth His favours upon whom He liketh, and has opened this portal of felicity to whomsoever was worthy thereof. Whatever we have read in the Torah about the qualities of that prophet coincides with those of Muhammad, without any increase or diminution. I fancy you will be ordered to emigrate, and will be unwilling to do so. Therefore your children will be dispersed, your habitations deserted, and your houses destroyed. It will then be expedient for you to make a profession of the religion of Muhammad to save your children and progeny from destruction.' They replied: 'We cannot abandon the Toratah and the religion of M\u00fbsa.' He continued: 'My second proposition is that you obey the order to emigrate from this country as soon as you receive it, because then your lives and property will be spared.' The Jews replied: 'We shall wait, because it is easier for us to leave our country than to give up the religion of M\u00fbsa\u2014u. w. b.'\n\nWhen his lordship the apostle had left his companions among the Bani An-natzyr and departed to Madinah, the companions were waiting a considerable time for him. After they were tired of waiting they arose, started, and when they arrived at Madinah they were allowed the honour of attending upon his lordship. On that occasion they said: 'O apostle of God, we did not know the reason of thy departing and not returning.' And he replied: 'The Jews meditated treachery, and God the Most High\n\n\\textsuperscript{291} The Pentateuch.\ninformed me thereof.' After that he despatched Muham-\nmad B. Moslamah with the following message to the Bani\nAn-natzyr: 'As you have machinated evil against me, I\norder you to leave the country, giving you a respite of ten\ndays for doing so, and whoever remains after the expiration\nof that time will have his head cut off by my orders.' The\nJews thereon began to make preparations to emigrate,\nwhen all of a sudden an envoy from A'bdullah B. Abu\nSalul arrived among them with this advice: 'Leave not\nyour country, but strengthen your position in your forts\nand be of good cheer, for I shall with two thousand valiant\nand experienced warriors come to your aid. Nor will the\nBani Qorittah Jews and their allies of the Bani Ghattfan\nrefuse to assist you.' On account of these words Hay Bin\nAkhttab sent the next day a man to wait upon his lordship\nthe refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014with the following\nreply: 'We shall not abandon our habitations: act thou as\nthou likest!' At the receipt of this news his lordship\u2014\nu. w. b.\u2014shouted the Takbyr, to which his companions\nresponded. By order of the best of men\u2014u. w. b.\u2014\nthe professors of Isl\u00e2m then made preparations for the cam-\npaign. The lord of apostleship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014appointed Ebn\nOmm Makn\u00fbb to be his lieutenant in Madinah; and,\nhaving bestowed the victorious standard upon the conquer-\ning lion of God [i.e., on A'li], they marched out of Madinah\nand held their next orisons in the plain of the Bani An-\nnatzyr. When the Jews beheld the army of Isl\u00e2m they\ntook refuge in their forts, from the ramparts whereof they\nshot arrows and threw stones till the night set in. After\nthe monotheists had held their dormitory orisons, and his\nlordship had, with ten of his companions, adjourned to his\nown quarters, all the companions, whose chief was A'li\u2014\nu. w. b.\u2014and, according to another tradition, Abu Bakr,\nwere, till the morning, occupied in besieging the Jews and\nin shouting the Takbyr.\n\nIt is said that the tent of his lordship had been pitched\nin the plain of Hattmah, and that a Jewish archer, called\nGhur\u00fbr, had struck it, for which occasion it was removed\nto another spot. When the night had set in it was found that his lordship, A\u2019li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014was absent from the camp. This circumstance having been reported to his lordship, he said: \u2018I fancy he has gone out on some business.\u2019 After awhile, however, the Lord A\u2019li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014again made his appearance, throwing the skull of Ghur\u00fbr at the feet of his lordship, and saying: \u2018O apostle of God, this is the head of that accursed fellow who has hit thy tent with an arrow.\u2019 His lordship enquired about the circumstances, whereon A\u2019li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014continued: \u2018As I knew him to be a valiant man, I thought I might sally out during the night and capture him when he was off his guard. I accordingly placed myself in ambush, and suddenly beheld him coming out with a drawn sword and nine men. I attacked and beheaded him; and his friends are so near that if thou wilt send some men with me I hope I shall vanquish them.\u2019 His lordship thereon despatched Abu Dujj\u00e2nah and Sahal B. Hanyf, with eight other brave men in the company of A\u2019li the lion of attack, as also ten of the principal Anss\u00e2r, in pursuit of the comrades of Ghur\u00fbr, whom they overtook at the gate of the fort, killed, and suspended the unhallowed skulls of the Jews from the house-doors of the Bhani Khutbah.\n\nDuring the days of the siege, the lord of apostleship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014ordered A\u2019bdullah B. Soll\u00e2m and Abu Layly Mozany to discomfit the machinations of the Jews, and to uproot the tree of their hopes which they had planted in their impure minds. Therefore Abu Layly felled the most fruitful date-trees called A\u2019jwah, and said: \u2018This will much sadden and distress the Jews.\u2019 Ebn Soll\u00e2m, however, felled the worst of the trees, saying: \u2018I know that soon all the property of the Jews will belong to the professors of Isl\u00e2m, and I have therefore left the best trees for them.\u2019 With reference to this matter the blessed verse, \u2018What palm-trees ye cut down or left standing on their roots,\u2019 etc., was revealed.\n\n292 Qur\u00e2\u00een, ch. lix. 5.\nAs A'bdullah Abu Monafiq had not kept his promise to aid the Bani An-natzyr, and as they had no assistance from any other quarter, they repented of what they had done, and sent a person to his lordship with the request to be left unmolested and to be allowed to emigrate. His lordship replied: 'I comply with your request only so far as to allow you to load upon your beasts whatever they can carry except arms, and to depart from my country.' In this manner some of the Jews went to Syria and others to Yemen, abandoning their fields and immovable property to his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014in so plenary a manner that he did not separate one-fifth therefrom [in the usual way]. The arms of the Bani Natzyr amounted to fifty cuirasses, as many helmets, and three hundred sabres, which he distributed to whoever wanted any. As for the crops of those unfortunate people, the apostle kept as much of the provisions for his family as would suffice for one year, and abandoned the remainder to the professors of Isl\u00e1m.\n\nThis year A'bdullah B. Othm\u00e1n, who was of the tribe of the apostle of Allah\u2014u. w. b.\u2014died, and Zaynab, the daughter of Khozaymah, as well as spouse of his lordship, also departed to the gardens of paradise, together with Abu Solmah B. A'bdullah Asad, who was the husband of Omm Solmah, and with Fattimah, the daughter of Asad, who was the mother of A'li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b. In this year also his lordship the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014contracted a matrimonial alliance with Omm Solmah.\n\nThe Ghazwah of the Bedr of Promise, which is also called the Small Bedr.\n\nIt was noticed above that Abu Sofyan had on his return from Ohod said to the Musalm\u00e1ns that the battle the next year would take place at Bedr. Some have related that his lordship said to F\u00e1riq: 'Tell him yes, if Allah pleaseth.' When the time of the promise was approaching, Abu\nSofyan began to make preparations for the campaign, and instigated the Qoraish to march out; but his heart was not in concert with his tongue. His urgency, namely, was founded on the apprehension that the people might say he was the cause of the non-fulfilment of the promise. This appears plainly from the following circumstances: Na\u2019ym, the son of Masu\u2019d Ashja\u2019y, had gone to Mekkah on pilgrimage, but before he started Abu Sofy\u00e1n met him, and said: \u2018I have made a promise on the day of Ohod to Muhammad, but as this year dearth and scarcity of food have befallen us, I am unwilling to march against him with the army. If, therefore, thou couldst on thy arrival at Madinah frighten Muhammad and his companions so as to induce them to break the promise, I would engage to give thee twenty camels of the age of three years, and Sahal B. A\u2019mru will be security for my fulfilling this promise.\u2019 Accordingly, when Na\u2019ym arrived in Madinah he informed the professors of Isl\u00e2m that the troops of aberration were approaching in great strength and formidable numbers ready for battle and contest. He also said: \u2018It will be better for you to withdraw your feet within the skirts of security, and not to leave Madinah on any account.\u2019 The Musalm\u00e1ns believed the words of Na\u2019ym, and were so unwilling to march out that his lordship imagined no one would take a share in that Ghazwah. Abu Bakr, however, and O\u2019mar waited upon his lordship, persuaded him to march out, and spoke so enticingly that he was highly pleased, and said: \u2018I swear by that God in the power of whose grasp my life is, that we shall sally forth, even if not a single individual accompanies us!\u2019\n\nAfter these words, the apprehensions vanished from the minds of all intelligent men, and they agreed to march. Accordingly his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014handed his victorious standard to A\u2019li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and started from Madinah in the company of one thousand five hundred valiant men for the purpose of extirpating Abu Sofy\u00e1n and the army of Satan. The professors of Isl\u00e2m possessed [only] ten horses, but plenty of\nmerchandise, which they sold on their arrival at Bedr\u2014in the first three days of the month Dhu-l-qa\u2019dah\u2014to such advantage that for each din\u00e2r of the value they obtained one din\u00e2r\u2019s profit. And after eight days they turned their faces beaming with joy and gladness again towards Madinah, but did not encounter the idolaters on that journey. Meanwhile Abu Sofy\u00e2n had marched from Mekkah with two thousand men, and had gone as far as W\u00e2di-tz-Tzuhr\u00e2n, and had again returned, which happened as follows: When the enemies had arrived in the just-mentioned place, Abu Sofy\u00e2n said to them: \u2018This is a year of famine and scarcity, and the camels give no milk, therefore it will be convenient for us to return from this place.\u2019 Thereon the professors of futility accepted the advice of Abu Sofy\u00e2n as wise, and returned to Mekkah. When the Qoraish heard of the success and prosperity of the professors of the orthodox religion, Ssafuw\u00e2n Bin Ommiah said to Abu Sofy\u00e2n: \u2018Thou hast made a promise to give battle to Muhammad, but wast unable to fulfil it; accordingly they [i.e., the Moslems] are impudent towards us.\u2019 Then they began to make preparations for the \u2018Battle of the Ditch,\u2019 which shall be described by-and-by, if it pleaseth Allah the Most High. As the opponents had for the campaign of \u2018the Bedr of promise\u2019 taken no other provisions to live upon except Sawyq,293 the inhabitants of Mekkah nicknamed the army \u2018the companions of Sawyq.\u2019\n\nAmong the events that took place during the fourth year after the Flight was also the stoning of a Jew and a Jewess who had been convicted of adultery, both of whom his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014caused to be lapidated according to the Law of the Toratah, which was also in accordance with the religion of U\u2019zza. At first, however, the Jews manifested pity for their co-religionists, and asserted that all which was required, according to the Toratah, would be to blacken the face of the adulterer and adulteress, to seat them backwards on a camel, and thus to\n\n293 The meaning of this word has already been explained; see footnote 262.\nlead them in procession round the town. But from the researches of A\u2019bdullah B. Soll\u00e2m, whose profession of Isl\u00e2m has already been recorded in these pages, it became evident that the above assertion of the Jews was false. His holy and prophetic lordship had apprehended that the Jews would probably alter and falsify the words of the Toratah, and had ordered Zayd B. Th\u00e2bet to study it. Zayd obeyed, and accomplished that important business in fifteen days.\n\nIn this year also Ta\u2019mah B. Abzaq had stolen a cuirass from the house of Qot\u00e2dah B. Nu\u2019m\u00e2n, the Anss\u00e2ri, and had carried it to the house of a Jew named Zayd B. Alyemin. By some means or other, Qot\u00e2dah happened to discover the coat of mail, and accused Zayd, but he replied: \u2018I am guiltless! Ta\u2019mah has brought this cuirass to my house as a deposit.\u2019 The people of Ta\u2019mah, however, though they knew that during the time of [pre-Islamic] ignorance larceny had been his occupation, waited upon his lordship the refuge of apostleship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and bore witness that the honour of Ta\u2019mah was untarnished by this crime. Therefore that prince intended to punish the Jew Zayd; meanwhile, however, the blessed verse \u2018We have revealed to thee the book in truth, to judge among men,\u2019 to the end of this verse was revealed. Accordingly, his lordship released Ebn Yemin, and ordered the hand of Ta\u2019mah to be cut off; the latter, however, fled from Madinah to Mekkah and brought eternal punishment upon his soul by the occupation of thieving to which he devoted himself. During this year also the verse concerning the prohibition of the use of wine was revealed, the circumstances whereof are recorded in biographical works.\n\nEvents of the Fifth Year after the Flight.\n\nSome biographers have recorded that the Ghazwah of Dh\u00e2tu-r-raqaa\u2019 took place during the month of Moharram\n\n---\n\n294 \u2018They will ask thee concerning wine and lots; answer, In both there is great sin.\u2019\u2014Qur\u00e2n, ch. ii. 216. \u2018O true believers, surely wine, and lots, and images, and divining arrows, are an abomination and the work of Satan,\u2019 etc.\u2014Ibid., ch. v. 92.\nin this year in consequence of the information brought by a man who had come to Madinah with some sheep for sale, that the Bani Athmar and Tha'labah had collected an army, and were about to attack the professors of Islam. When the apostle of God had become aware of this intention he appointed Dhu-n-n\u00fbryn to be his lieutenant in Madinah, and marched forth with four hundred, or, according to another tradition, with five hundred men on a Sunday night on the 10th of the above-named month, and halted after reaching a place belonging to the professors of idolatry and infidelity called Dhatu-r-raqaa', where the Musalmans found only women, because all the men had gone to the mountain. The noble companions were afraid to plunder, lest the idolaters might make use of the opportunity and come out from their ambush. In that place his lordship held the prayer of fear,\\(^{295}\\) which was the first of this kind that had been held. Some assert that the reason for calling this the Ghazwah of Dhatu-r-raqaa' was because near the habitation of the professors of obstinacy and schism there was a mountain, a portion of which looked like the variegated patches [Raq] which it is customary to mend garments with. In this expedition that prince was absent from Madinah for a fortnight, and after his return he did not march out with his army till the month Rabii' the first. Some say that the Ghazwah of Dh\u00e1tu-r-raqaa' took place after the Ghazwah of Khayber.\n\n**The Ghazwah of Dumatu-j-jandal.**\n\nIt is recorded in the *Mostaqadza'* that Dumatu-j-jandal with Dzamma over the D\u00e1l and Fath over the Jim is the name of a place, the distance whereof from Kufah amounts to ten stages, and as many to Damascus. With Fath over the D\u00e1l [when the word must be read *Damat*] it is the name of the mother of Mukht\u00e2r B. Abu O'baydah Thaqafi.\n\n\\(^{295}\\) 'But when thou [O prophet] shalt be among them, and shalt pray with them, let a party of them arise to prayer with thee, and let them take their arms,' etc.\u2014Qur\u00e2n, ch. iv. 103.\nIt has also been said that Dumatah is a fort, the foundations of which are stone; and the produce of that region consists of dates and barley. The reason for this Ghazwah was that Akydar B. A\u2019bdul-malak, the governor of that place, who was a Christian and a subject of the Qaissar [i.e., Byzantine emperor], had collected an army and intended to attack his lordship the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b. When this news reached the exalted audition of the best of men, he started on Monday [date not given] of the month Rabii\u2019 the first, with one thousand men towards the fort and stronghold of the insurgents, and travelled by the aid of a guide during the night, resting during the day. When not more than the distance of one day\u2019s and night\u2019s march separated the victorious banners from Dumatu-j-jandal, information was brought to his lordship that the cattle of the opponents were near. Accordingly that prince issued orders to capture and to fetter them. The herdsmen fled, and carried the news to the fort of Dumatu-j-jandal, the people of which place dispersed, so that his lordship entered and sojourned therein several days, but sent out foraging parties in all directions, and Muhammad B. Moslamah captured and brought one of the enemies into the august assembly of his lordship the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014who made inquiries about the inhabitants, and was told that they had all fled at his approach. After that this individual became a Musalm\u00e2n, and his lordship the apostle returned to Madinah, the expedition having lasted one month.\n\n**Ghazwah of Rabyi\u2019, also called Ghazwah of the Bani Mossttalaq.**\n\nIt is recorded in the Kazr\u00e2ni that, according to the tradition of Murta\u2019, Rabyi\u2019 is the name of a well near which the Bani Mossttalaq were encamped, and in the Mostaqadza\u2019 we read that \u2018it is the water of a population between Mekkah and Madinah from the region of Qadid to the coast, and the Ghazwah is also called that of the Bani\nAlmossttalaq B. O\u2019ru B. Rabia\u2019 B. Kharjah.\u2019 The cause of this Ghazwah was that H\u00e2reth B. Abu Dhar\u00e2r, the chieftain of that clan, had invited several Arab tribes to unite with him in attacking his lordship the asylum of the apostolate\u2014u. w. b. His lordship the apostle despatched Buridah296 B. Ahassib towards the opponents to bring correct information. He accordingly went among them, but they examined him about the prophet, and he gave them a reply appropriate to the circumstances, saying also: \u2018I have heard that you intend to wage war against Muhammad, and I have come to offer you my aid, if this report be true.\u2019 The Bani Mossttalaq treated him very respectfully, and said: \u2018What thou hast heard is true.\u2019 Buridah continued: \u2018I am going to bring an army to join you.\u2019 After uttering these words he left them, hastened to Madinah, and made his report about them. Then his lordship the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014prepared his army, gave the banner of the Moh\u00e2jer to the lord A\u2019li B. Abu Taleb\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and that of the Anss\u00e2r to Sa\u2019d B. A\u2019b\u00e2dah, ordering O\u2019mar to take charge of the vanguard, Zayd B. H\u00e2reth of the left wing, and retained A\u2019kramah B. Mohssan near himself. In that expedition the Moh\u00e2jer had twenty horses, as also the Anss\u00e2r; and many hypocrites, allured by the hope of booty, marched on that occasion with the Musalm\u00e2ns. A spy was taken and brought before F\u00e2ruq [i.e., O\u2019mar], who was in command of the vanguard. After being closely pressed, this individual confessed that he had been sent by a chief of the Bani Mossttalaq to reconnoitre the Musalm\u00e2n army, for the purpose of enabling him to enter the lists of contention with open eyes. O\u2019mar presented that spy also to the most exalted assembly of his holy and prophetic lordship, who examined him about his errand, and proposed to him to embrace monotheism, but that idolater refused to comply; accordingly O\u2019mar liberated that man\u2019s soul, with the permission of his\n\n296 Burid means courier in Arabic, but the word is originally Per.-ian, because the mules used by couriers were dock-tailed. See footnote to Dr. A. Sprenger\u2019s \u2018 Meadows by Gold,\u2019 of Masu\u2019di, p. 331.\nlordship, from the captivity and servitude of his body. When the opponents heard that their spy had been killed they were overpowered by great apprehension and fear, so that all the people of the surrounding country that had gathered around H\u00e2reth now dispersed in every direction, and only the Bani Mossttalaq remained with him. His lordship the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014halted, after traversing the proper distance, at the well of the Bani Mossttalaq. In that journey the mothers of the believers A'ayshah and Omm Solmah were present. The infidels entrusted a man, Ssafuw\u00e2n by name, with their broken standard, and marched into the plain of contest. When both armies were in battle array, the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014ordered O'mar to turn to the idolaters, and to exclaim: 'Say, there is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is the apostle of Allah, whereon your lives and your property will be spared.' But as they refused to comply, his lordship ordered the professors of Isl\u00e2m to rush upon them immediately. Abu Qot\u00e2dah then attacked them and slew the standard-bearer [i.e., commander] of the infidels; Allah the Most High likewise aided the professors of Isl\u00e2m with His mighty angels, and inspired the hearts of the unbelievers with fear and apprehension. It is related that after the battle one of the Bani Mossttalaq said: 'On that day we beheld men dressed in white garments and mounted on piebald horses within the ranks of the Musalm\u00e2n army, and we had never before seen such individuals.' J\u00e2rirah, the daughter of H\u00e2reth B. Abu Dhar\u00e2r, says: 'When the apostle of God arrived near us, my father said: \"An army is approaching us, which we are unable to resist. I have beheld several horses and weapons in the army of Isl\u00e2m which my tongue cannot describe.\" When I had made my profession of Isl\u00e2m, and the lord of apostleship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014married me, the grandeur and sublimity of the Musalm\u00e2ns did not strike me as on the first occasion, and I knew that all the fear and awe had been thrown into the hearts of the idolaters by God the Most High, considering that in the said battle [only] ten idolaters were slain, but the others so\ncompletely frightened that all that crowd of men and women was captured in the grasp of fate.' J\u00e2rirah, the daughter of H\u00e2reth B. Abu Dhar\u00e2r, had fallen to the share of Thabet B. Qais Shamm\u00e2s, but some say that he presented her to his lordship, and others assert that he allowed her to ransom herself. J\u00e2rirah waited upon his lordship the best of men, pronounced the confession of Faith, became an adherent of Isl\u00e2m, and said: 'Thabet has fixed my ransom so high that I am unable to pay it, I therefore request thee to help me.' The apostle complied with her prayer, and promised to marry her. Accordingly J\u00e2rirah replied: 'What felicity can be greater than this?' His lordship then paid the ransom and wedded her. When the noble companions learnt what had taken place, they said to each other: 'It is not meet that the relatives of the prince of the sons of Adam\u2014u. w. b.\u2014should suffer humiliation and captivity.' They therefore liberated all the prisoners of the tribe Bani Mossttalaq. A'ayshah says: 'I do not know any woman who has conferred a greater blessing upon her people than J\u00e2rirah.' The original name of the daughter of H\u00e2reth B. Abu Dhar\u00e2r was Barah, but his lordship the prince of the righteous changed it to J\u00e2rirah.\n\nAfter the fight with the Bani Mossttalaq, Jahni wantonly struck, during the march, San\u00e2n on the face, whereon the latter shouted: 'O ye Anssar!' and the former: 'O ye Moh\u00e2jer!' Then both parties rushed on each other with drawn swords, and great confusion was about to ensue; at last, however, some of the Moh\u00e2jer flattered San\u00e2n for the sake of quelling the disturbance, and succeeded in pacifying him. When the circumstances of this quarrel were brought to the notice of A'bdullah B. Abu Sal\u00fbl the hypocrite, he blazed up with ire, saying to a number of friends and hypocrites who were in his company: 'Whatever strength and dignity the Moh\u00e2jer possess they have acquired through us. I swear by Allah that their relation to us is like that of a leaf to a tree.' He further said: 'If we return to Madinah, he that is nobler will expel him\nwho is meaner.' By the expression 'he that is nobler' that wretch meant his own miserable person, and by 'him who is meaner' he intended to designate the precious individuality of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b. Then he turned towards the chiefs of his people, such as M\u00e2lek, Sowid and Mu\u2019qab B. Qais and others, saying: 'All this is the result of your having admitted them into your country and divided your property among them. Had you kept back your possessions from these people, they would not be riding on your necks.' Zayd B. Arqum the Anss\u00e2ri, who was present in the assembly of Abu Sal\u00fbl, spoke, however, despite his youthfulness, boldly against the views of the former, and then hastened to wait upon the prince of this world\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and represented to him what was going on. A number of the principal companions, such as F\u00e2r\u00fbq [i.e., O\u2019mar], Ssiddyq [i.e., Abu Bakr], Dhu-n-m\u00fbryn [i.e., O\u2019tthman], Sa\u2019d Abu Woqq\u00e2ss, Muhammad B. Moslamah, and A\u2019bb\u00e2s B. Bashir, were present in the august assembly of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014who considered Zayd\u2019s assertions to flow from interested motives, but he swore an oath that the words he reported had been spoken by A\u2019bdullah B. Abu Sal\u00fbl. Hereon the apostle exclaimed: 'Perhaps thou hast not heard well?' Zayd, nevertheless, insisting on the veracity of his statement, F\u00e2r\u00fbq shouted: 'O apostle of God, allow me to strike off the head of that hypocrite!' His lordship, however, replied: 'O\u2019mar, if I permit him to be slain many of the princes of Yathrab will tremble!' O\u2019mar continued: 'If thou wilt not order the Moh\u00e2jer to kill him, allow Muhammad B. Moslamah or A\u2019b\u00e2dah B. Bashir, or Sa\u2019d B. Moa\u2019adh, to do so.' The apostle rejoined: 'People will say Muhammad is killing his companions; [nevertheless] give them leave to march.' Accordingly O\u2019mar obeyed orders, despite of the great heat, and no one knew the reason for starting in such warm weather, which was, however, to deprive everyone of the opportunity for holding similar conversations. When his holy and prophetic lordship mounted his she-camel\nQasswi, Sa\u2019d B. Moa\u2019adh came forward, and said: \u2018Greeting to thee, O prophet, with the mercy of Allah and His blessings! What is the matter with thee that thou hast started at this unpropitious hour?\u2019 His lordship replied: \u2018Perhaps you have not heard what your friend has said?\u2019 Sa\u2019d asked: \u2018What friend?\u2019 His lordship replied: \u2018Ebn Abu Sal\u00fbl has said that when he arrives in Madinah he who is more noble will expel him who is more mean.\u2019 Sa\u2019d answered: \u2018O apostle of God, if thou willest thou canst expel him from Madinah, because he is mean and thou art the noblest of the people; and special nobility is peculiar to God, to thee, and to the believers.\u2019 Some biographers have recorded that the just-mentioned conversation passed between Asyd B. Khudzar and his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b. After that Sa\u2019d B. Moa\u2019adh, or Asyd B. Khudzar, according to two different traditions, said to the prophet: \u2018Be kind and friendly to him, because before thy august approach the people of Madinah had agreed to place the reins of the important office of government into the grasp of his power and choice. A diadem encrusted with rubies, pearls, and precious gems had been prepared at Madinah, and completed, except one costly gem which Yoshua\u2019, the Jew, possessed and valued very highly on account of the need of the people, and would not sell at any price. Meanwhile the Lord God Most High had adorned and ennobled our country with thy august existence, and the crown of Ebn Abu Sal\u00fbl remained in the shop of the jeweller. He knows that thou art the cause of his having been deprived of the government, and on account of this disappointment he makes such speeches.\u2019 It is related that the lord of prophecy sent a man to A\u2019bdullah [Ebn Abu Sal\u00fbl] to reproach him for having uttered the above-mentioned threat; others, however, allege that certain Anss\u00e2ris said to him: \u2018Some of thy words have reached the most exalted prophetic audition, and if they be true thou must hasten to wait upon his lordship, apologize to him, and repent of what thou hast uttered, so that he may intercede for thee with the Almighty. Thou\noughtest to be very contrite, because possibly a verse may be revealed concerning thee, wherein Allah the Most High will bring thy falsehood to light. But if those words be not true it will be thy duty to excuse and to free thyself from the aspersion.' Accordingly Ebn Abu Mon\u0101fiq [i.e., E. Abu Sal\u016bl] entered the assembly of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014swore that he had never uttered the words reported to his lordship the apostle, and that the assertion of Zayd B. Arqum was mendacious. Some who were present in the prophetic assembly thought that Zayd had purposely uttered a lie, whilst others imagined that he had concocted the story on account of the heedlessness of his youthful age. As A'bdullah [E. Abu Sal\u016bl] enjoyed high dignity and respect among his people, they said: 'O apostle of God, the utterance of a boy with reference to one of our Sheikhs is deserving of no credence.' Accordingly the apostle of God accepted the excuse of A'bdullah; the Anss\u00e2r greatly blamed Zayd, and his uncle said: 'Thou hast done this only that the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014has, by forgiving A'bdullah, convicted thee of falsehood, has believed a hypocrite, and has raised the enmity of the people against thee.' During that day and night the army of Isl\u00e2m continued to march, and halted the next morning when the sun rose. Fatigue had so overpowered the men that every one went immediately to sleep, and that no opportunity remained for discussing the affair of A'bdullah and Zayd. The last-mentioned individual had before this event been accustomed to ride near the body-guard of his lordship, but after it shame and grief kept him at a distance. There is a tradition that Zayd B. Arqum said: 'I was riding on my horse, and was greatly depressed in spirit, when all of a sudden the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014overtook me, pulled my ear, looked smilingly in my face, and said: \"Glad tidings to thee, O Zayd, for God the Most High considers thee to be true, and A'bdullah a liar.\" Then he recited the chapter of the hypocrites as far as the verse: \"They say, Verily if we return to Madinah, the\nworthier shall expel thence the meaner.\" After the veracity of Zayd B. Arqum had become evident, A'bdalah B. Ass\u00e2mat and Awus B. A'bdullah passed near A'bdullah B. Abu Sal\u00fbl, and failed to greet him. He therefore reproved them, but those two blessed individuals warned him of the eternal punishment he would have to incur for having sworn a false oath, and Awus said: 'We shall have nothing to do with thee until thou repentest.' And A'bdalah added: 'Come to his lordship, that he may ask the forgiveness of God for thee.' That heedless and perjured man, however, turned his neck and looked away from A'bdullah, who continued: 'By Allah! with reference to thee and the turning of thy neck, a verse of the Qur\u00e2n will be revealed, which shall be recited during prayers;' and the blessed verse, 'When it is said unto them, Come, that the apostle of God may ask pardon for you, they turn away their heads, and thou seest them retire big with disdain,' is confirmatory of the above assertion.\n\nIt is said that A'bdullah B. Abu Sal\u00fbl had a son of the same name who obeyed God and the prophet, being very different from his father. When this young man heard F\u00e2ruq requesting the apostle to appoint Muhammad B. Moslamah or some other Anss\u00e2r to kill A'bdullah B. Abu Sal\u00fbl, he approached his lordship, and said: 'If thou intendest to slay my father, order me to do it, and I swear by Allah that ere thou risest from the assembly I shall bring his head to thee. By Allah! the men of the Khazraj [tribe] know that of all of them I have acted the best towards my father, and that since a certain time he takes neither food nor drink from the hands of anyone except from me; and I fear, O apostle of God, that if another man attempts to kill him, and I see it, consanguinity [or, rather, filial duty] will compel me to avenge his death on that person, and that I shall for such a deed obtain eternal punishment in hell. Thy favour, however, and thy forgivingness are great.' The apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014replied: 'O A'bdullah, it is not my intention to kill thy\n\n297 Qur\u00e2n, ch. lxiii. 8. 298 Ibid., 5.\nfather, nor have I ordered anyone to do so, and as long as he remains among us I shall treat him well.' When A'bdullah, the son of A'bdullah E. Sal\u00fbl knew that the life of his father was to be spared, he uttered some distich, the translation of which [from the Arabic] is as follows:\n\n'The world is full of marvels, but more wonderful are\nThe words I heard O'mar saying to the prophet:\n\"Order some one to bring Ebn Abu's head to thee!\"\nI said to the apostle: \"If he is to be killed, order me to do it.\"\nMy arm is strong and my heart is firm,\nMy resolution is stancher than iron and ore.'\n\nIt is related in the Mostayadza that when Ebn Abu Sal\u00fbl arrived near Madinah, and desired to enter that prosperous region, his son A'bdullah took hold of his horse's bridle, stopped it, and said: 'I swear by God that I shall not allow thee to enter this town unless by the permission of the apostle of God, because he is the most noble of the sons of Adam, and thou art the meanest of the inhabitants of this world.' He asked permission from his lordship to commit parricide, but the latter replied: 'Let him alone, and behave kindly to him.'\n\nIt is related that during the return march from the Ghazwah with the Bani Mossttalaq a very high wind commenced to blow, and some people thought that enemies had entered Madinah to plunder it [on such an occasion]; but his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014exclaimed: 'Be not afraid! Madinah is my place, and there is no spot nor corner thereof which does not contain an angel to guard it and to watch over it; this day, however, one of the very greatest hypocrites has died.' And, according to the tradition of Muhammad E. Esah\u00e2q, Zayd B. Raqaa'l had on that day departed to hell. When this information reached A'bdullah B. Abu Sal\u00fbl he was overpowered with fear and grief, because he had been on very intimate terms with the deceased.\nThere is a tradition of A'ayshah that she said: 'When the apostle intended to go on a journey he was in the habit of drawing or throwing lots concerning his wives, and she on whom it [i.e., the lot] fell accompanied him. In this Ghazwah the lot came upon my name, and I enjoyed the happiness of going with him. As at that time the verse of the curtain had not yet been revealed, a howdah was prepared for me, in which I sat, and which was placed on the camel I rode. When the campaign was over we marched back, and arrived in the vicinity of Mekkah [sic]. Whilst the order to start was being given in one of the halting-places I had gone out of the camp for a natural purpose, and on returning to it I perceived that I had lost my necklace. Accordingly I retraced my steps and searched the place where I had been till I found my trinket. In my absence, however, the men who were accustomed to place the howdah upon the camel arrived and did their duty. At that time women were weak and light, because they were content to eat only so much as would satisfy their hunger. I was young and light, so that the difference of the weight could not be perceived whether I was in the howdah or not. When I returned from the place where I had answered a call of nature I saw no one, and said to myself: \"If they do not see me they will come and look for me.\" Accordingly I sat down in the same place until I was overpowered by sleep, and began to slumber until the morning, when Ssafuw\u00e2n B. Moa'ttal Solmy, who had followed in the rear of the army for some business, arrived in that place, saw me, and exclaimed: \"We are Allah's, and unto Him shall we surely return.\" The repetition of this phrase awakened me, and caused me to veil my face. Ssafuw\u00e2n made his camel kneel down, stood aloof, and said:\n\n299 The whole statement of A'ayshah, one of the wives of the prophet, our author has literally translated from Ebn Esah\u00e2q's biography of Muhammad, published in the original Arabic by Dr. W\u00fcstenfeld, and translated by me into English.\n\n300 Qur\u00e2n, ch. ii. 151.\n\"Mount.\" Accordingly I rode on the camel, which Ssafuw\u00e2n led with the bridle, until we reached, during the heat of the day, the place where the army was halting. Hypocrites have uttered with reference to us whatever opinions their minds suggested; of their number A'bdullah Bin Abu Sal\u00fbl was one, and of that of the Musalm\u00e2ns were Has\u00e2n B. Th\u00e2bet, and Mosattah B. As\u00e2mah, and others, who all agreed in the calumny [concerning me].'\n\nSsidiqah [i.e., A'ayshah] continues: 'When I arrived in Madinah I fell sick, and the calumnies of those men spread among the people. I knew nothing, but I found that the apostle's behaviour towards me had changed. I did not experience any of that kindness from him which he had manifested to me in former maladies; but I was not aware of the cause until one night during my recovery, when I was with the mother of Mosattah\u2014who then happened to be in Madinah\u2014going out for a natural purpose, water-closets not having as yet become customary at that time. Her wrapper having become entangled, she fell down, and began to revile her son; but I asked: \"Insultest thou a man who has been present at the battle of Bedr?\" This falling and squabbling was thrice repeated, whereon she said at last: \"O A'ayshah, hast thou not heard what he said?\" I asked what he had spoken, and the mother of Mosattah informed me of the circumstances of the case and of the slander. My disease augmented, and I returned to the house. When the apostle of God came near me, I said: \"O apostle of Allah, permit me to return to my father's house,\" my intention being to institute an inquiry into the matter of the calumny. When I arrived in my father's house I asked my mother: \"What story are the people relating about me?\" My mother replied: \"Be not dismayed, but take the matter easy. By Allah! there is not one handsome and noble woman whom her husband loves, but has other wives besides her, concerning whom similar tales are not bandied about.\" I exclaimed: \"Praise be to Allah! have they said such words?\" But I could not sleep that night, and my tears did not cease to flow.\"\nSsidiqah continues: 'His lordship the refuge of the apostolate\u2014u. w. b.\u2014called A'li B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and As\u00e2matah B. Zayd, to consult them about divorcing me. As\u00e2matah said: \"We think nothing but good about thy wife.\" And A'li B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb said: \"O apostle of God, the Almighty has not distressed thee through women, except by their multitude. Examine Baryrah, the servant girl of A'ayshah, and she will tell the truth.\" Accordingly that prince examined Baryrah, and she spoke as follows: \"I swear by that God who has sent thee in truth that I have seen nothing blameworthy in A'ayshah, except that she sometimes falls asleep, so that the sheep come and eat up the leavened flour.\"\n\nEsma'il B. Nitz\u00e2mu-l-mulk relates in the Khul\u00e2ssatu-s-seyr that in those times his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014was one day sitting in his house in a state of depression and melancholy, when F\u00e2r\u00fbq [i.e., O'mar] entered, and the apostle asked him: 'What sayest thou of this event?' He replied: 'O apostle of God, I know for a certainty that the hypocrites are speaking lies.' He continued: 'By what reason?' F\u00e2r\u00fbq replied: 'By reason of God's not allowing a fly to settle upon thy blessed skirts, because it alights also on impure things and soils its feet. How, then, would He not preserve thee from a worse defilement?' His lordship was highly pleased and flattered by these remarks. After that Dhu-n-n\u00fbryn entered, and his lordship spoke to him on the same subject, and he replied: 'I am sure the hypocrites are liars.' That prince continued: 'By what reason?' He replied: 'Because God the Most High does not allow thy shadow to fall upon the ground, lest it might be polluted, or a person might step thereon. If, therefore, God the Most High thus protects thy shadow, will He not restrain thy honoured spouse from committing such an impropriety, or allow a stranger to defile the honour of thy wife with the pollution of treachery?' At these words of Dhu-n-n\u00fbryn the most noble mind became yet more tranquillized. Then A'li B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb entered, whereon his holy and prophetic lord-\nship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014repeated his former words, to which A\u2019li replied: \u2018This story is but a fiction and a lie of the hypocrites. The proof of my assertion is, that one day we were at prayers with thee, during which thou hadst removed thy sandals from thy feet, and we imitated thy example. After our devotions were terminated, thou hadst asked why we bared our feet, and we replied that we had done so to imitate thee, whereon thou hadst said: \u201cI put away the sandals because Jebr\u00e2il had informed me that they were prayerless.\u201d Now, if God the Most High has sent thee a revelation that thy sandals are prayerless, He would surely have informed thee of this matter also, had it been true. Keep, therefore, thy exalted mind at ease, because the Most High will cause the innocence of A\u2019ayshah to become manifest.\u2019 All these utterances so gladdened the heart of his lordship that he immediately went to the house of Ssidiqah.\n\nSsidiqah says: \u2018I was sitting in the house of my parents, and was weeping, when a certain Anss\u00e2ri woman entered and kept me company in crying; both my parents were also sitting with us, when all of a sudden the apostle of God honoured us with his noble presence, opened his mouth, after sitting down, in praise of God the Most High, uttered both the professions,\\(^{301}\\) and said: \u201cAfter the usual salutations, I inform thee, O A\u2019ayshah, that if thou art free of this crime God the Most High will soon satisfy thee. But if thou be guilty, then repent, ask forgiveness from, and return to the obedience of God; because if a servant falls into sin, but confesses and repents, the Most High accepts his contrition, and grants him pardon.\u201d\u2019 A\u2019ayshah says: \u2018When the apostle of Allah had done speaking, my tears also ceased to flow, and I said to my father: \u201cReply to his lordship the apostle.\u201d\u2019 But my father answered: \u201cBy Allah! I do not know what to reply to him. During the time of ignorance we were idolaters, and did not know the religion. Nobody ever uttered such words with regard to\n\n\\(^{301}\\) The first profession is that there is no God but Allah; and the second is that Muhammad is His prophet.\nour family, and now, when our house is illuminated by the light of Isl\u00e2m, and the caskets of our hearts are brightened by the light of monotheism, people are holding such speeches about us, what am I to say to the apostle of God?\" Then I said to my mother: \"Reply for me.\" But my mother rejoined: \"I am also at a loss what to answer.\" Accordingly I was under the necessity of doing so myself, as follows: \"I swear by God that if I say I am innocent of what you have heard about me, and of what you believe, you will place no faith in my words; but if I confess to have committed what I have not, you will believe me. By Allah! in the matter between you and me I cannot find a better resemblance than the words of Yusuf [Joseph]\u2014peace be on him\u2014who said: 'Verily patience is best, and God will defeat their insinuations.'\" And on account of the great fear and trouble I was in, the words of Y\u2019aq\u00fbb [Jacob] with reference to Yusuf might have been applied to me.\n\nIn some books it is recorded that Ssidiqah said: 'I exclaimed, \"I swear by God that I cannot find a better consolation for me than the words of Yusuf: 'Verily patience is best,' etc., and though I tried much to speak about Y\u2019aq\u00fbb, my memory failed me; so I turned my face away after uttering these words, and reclined. And, by Allah! as I was innocent, I knew that his lordship would absolve me from all blame. I had, however, no idea that with reference to me a verse of the Qur\u00e2\u0144 would be revealed, to be read in mosques and places of prayer till the day of the resurrection, because I was aware of the greatness and magnificence of the Lord of Glory, and considering my own abject and helpless condition, I thought myself too mean that the Lord God should speak about me. Nevertheless, I hoped that his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014would dream a dream which would convince him of my innocence. But I swear by Allah that his lordship had not yet risen from the assembly, nor had anyone as yet left\n\n302 For the Moslem version of the story of Jacob, Joseph and his brethren, see Part I., vol. i., p. 198, of this work.\nthe house, when the signs of Divine revelation began to manifest themselves upon his lordship; and whenever the signs of revelation appeared, the people who were with him became aware thereof.'\n\nSsidiqah continues: 'On that occasion my mother placed a cushion of perfumed goat-leather under his lordship's head, and covered him with a Yemeni cloak, which he removed from his face as soon as the Divine inspiration developed itself. From his blessed countenance drops of perspiration began to trickle like so many brilliant pearls; he smiled, and the first words he uttered were these: \"Glad tidings to thee, O A'ayshah! God the Most High has excanted thee, and borne witness to thy purity.\" My mother then said: \"A'ayshah, rise! Go to the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and wait upon him.\" I replied: \"By Allah, I shall not! In this matter I do not wish to incur obligation to anyone except to God, nor shall I praise and laud anyone except Him who has sent my justification.\"\n\nWith reference to the purity of A'ayshah, ten verses have been revealed, which begin with the words, '[As to] the party among you who have published the falsehood [concerning A'ayshah],' and end with the following, 'The wicked women [should be joined] to the wicked men, and the wicked men to the wicked women; but the good women [should be married] to the good men, and the good men to the good women. These shall be cleared from [the calumnies] which they [i.e., the slanderers] speak [of them]; they shall obtain pardon, and an honourable provision.' It is said that before the verses justifying A'ayshah had been revealed, the wife of Abu Ay\u00fbb the Anss\u00e2ri said to him: 'Hast thou heard what people are speaking about A'ayshah?' Abu Ay\u00fbb replied: 'It is not for us to talk of this matter. God forbid! It is a great slander.' These words were approved in the Court of Unity; and accordingly the blessed verse, 'It belongeth not unto us that we should talk of this [matter]. Allah forbid! This is a grievous calumny!' was revealed.\n\n303 Qur\u00e2n, ch. xxiv. 11. 304 Ibid., 26. 305 Ibid., 15.\nIt is related that Mosattah B. As\u00e2mah was a relative of Abu Bakr, not blessed with any worldly goods, and that Ssidyq supplied him with all the necessaries of life despite his own poverty. It has been narrated above that, in this matter, Mosattah B. As\u00e2mah sided with the hypocrites, and when the verse of justification was revealed, Abu Bakr swore that he would no longer give anything to Mosattah; and on that occasion God the Most High and Magnificent revealed the following verse: 'Let not those among you who possess abundance [of wealth] and [have] ability swear that they will not give unto [their] kindred and the poor, and those who have fled their country for the sake of Allah's true religion; but let them forgive, and act with benevolence [towards them]. Do ye not desire that Allah should pardon you? And Allah is gracious [and] merciful.' When Ssidyq heard this verse, he said: 'Indeed I want God the Most High to forgive me'; whereon he provided food and raiment for Mosattah as of yore, and swore to continue to do so to the end of his life.\n\nIn the Khul\u00e2ssatu-s-seyr it is recorded that when the verses exculpating A'ayshah were revealed, his holy and prophetic lordship punished four persons, each of whom received eighty lashes with a whip; they were A'bdu'llah B. Abu Sal\u00fbl the hypocrite, and Has\u00e2n B. Th\u00e2bet, and Mosattah B. As\u00e2mah, and Juhnah, the sister of Zaynab, daughter of Hajash, Zaynab being one of the mothers of the Believers [i.e., one of the wives of the prophet].\n\nSome relaters of traditions state that during this journey [or Ghazwah of the Bani Mostalaq] the verse 'to complete' was revealed, which happened as follows: When the victorious banners of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014\n\n306 Quran, ch. xxiv. 22.\n307 The words 'to complete' occur only towards the end of the verse, but it is necessary to give the whole of it here, for the sake of perspicuity, as follows: 'But if ye be sick, or on a journey, or any of you cometh from the privy, or [if] you have touched women, and ye find no water, take fine clean sand, and rub your faces and your hands therewith. Allah would not put a difficulty upon you; but He desireth to purify you, and to complete His favour upon you, that ye may give thanks.'\u2014Quran, ch. v. 9.\nu. w. b.\u2014had arrived near Madinah, the necklace of A\u2019ayshah was lost, and his lordship the apostle halted in a place until the lost article should be found. As, however, in that locality the companions were unable to obtain any water, their prayers would be of no effect. Therefore some Musalm\u00e2ns went to Ssidyq and grumbled that on account of the loss of his daughter A\u2019ayshah\u2019s necklace the apostle of God\u2014u. w. b.\u2014was remaining in a waterless place like this, and that the time for prayers had nearly expired. Abu Bakr accordingly entered the tent of A\u2019ayshah, where he found the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014asleep with his blessed head in her lap. Abu Bakr reproached his daughter, and spoke sharply to her. When his lordship the apostle awoke from sleep and found no water for the ablution required before prayers, God the Most High and Glorious revealed in His boundless mercy the verse \u2018to complete\u2019; and there is a tradition of A\u2019ayshah that, when they caused the camel to get up, they found the necklace under it.\n\nThe Ghazwah of the Ditch, called also the Ghazwah of the Confederates.\n\nWhen the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had driven the Bani Annatzyr away from the vicinity of Mekkah, they dispersed in the country. A number of them, such as Hay B. Akhtt\u00e2b and Soll\u00e2m B. Al-tahyq and Kenanah B. Raby\u00ee\u2019, with their adherents, went to Khayber, where they settled. They were, however, day and night meditating how they might avenge themselves upon the Musalm\u00e2ns, till at last about twenty individuals of them went with Abu A\u2019amer the monk to Mekkah, and invited the Qoraish idolaters to wage war against the professors of Isl\u00e2m. They also informed Abu Sofy\u00e2n of the object of their visit, saying: \u2018We have come to make an alliance with you to extirpate and to annihilate Muhammad, and to confirm our intention by a treaty.\u2019 Sofy\u00e2n replied: \u2018You are welcome. We\n\n308 See preceding footnote.\nlove those people best who hate Muhammad most and are ready to assist us in that matter to the best of their ability.' Then the Jews requested Abu Sofy\u00e2n to cause seventy chosen men of the Qoraish to go among the curtains of the Ka'bah, so as to touch the house of Allah with their breasts. In this way they made a covenant with each other to be steadfast and unanimous in their enmity towards his lordship the apostle, and not to cease to wage war against him during their whole lives, and Abu Sofy\u00e2n said, at the instigation of the Qoraish, to the Bani An-natzyr Jews: 'We keep the buildings of the Ka'bah in good order, we slaughter camels with big hunches for our guests, we provide the pilgrims with food and drink, we cherish our kindred, and maintain the worship of idols according to the custom of our fathers and ancestors; but Muhammad has brought a new religion with new-fangled usages. Tell us now, as you are learned and possessors of the book [of the Pentateuch], which of these two religions is better?' The Jews, although they hated idolatry, nevertheless gave preference to the Qoraish over the orthodox religion and most noble Law on account of their envy, not dreading the wrath of God the Most High, who thereon revealed the following verse with reference to them: 'Lookest thou not upon those to whom a part of the book has been given; they believe in Jibt and in Tt\u00e2gh\u00fbt, and say to those who have professed unbelief: \"These are more directed in the [right] way than those who have believed. They are those whom Allah has cursed,\"' till the end of the verse.\n\nAfter the Qoraish had obtained the approbation of the Jews they made preparations for war. The Bani Natzyr and the idolaters appointed a time for assembling, and after they had satisfied their minds on the progress of their affairs they went to the tribe Ghattaf\u00e2n, and received their aid on the promise of one year's crop of dates, and entered into similar engagements with other tribes. Abu Sofy\u00e2n occupied himself with collecting the army, and started\n\n300 Qur\u00e2n, ch. iv. 54.\u2014Sale has 'false gods and idols,' Jibt and Ttagh\u00fbt.\nfrom Mekkah with four thousand men, one thousand five hundred camels, and three hundred horses. The banner [of command], which had been tied [to a spear] in the 'house of assembly,' was given to Nu'm\u00e2n B. Ttolhah B. Abu Ttolhah. In Mara-Atzahr\u00e2n, O'tbah B. Hassyn Qor\u00e2wi, the chief of the tribe Ghattaf\u00e2n, and Ttolhah B. Kowildar, the headman of the Bani Asad, and the chiefs of other tribes, such as H\u00e1reth B. A'wuf and Sa'd B. Baryrah and others, arrived with their troops and met the Qoraish. The multitude of the enemies was so great that the mountains and plains could scarcely contain them, and all of them marched together towards Madinah. When the ray of information shone upon the front of his lordship's luminous mind he convoked the principal Moh\u00e1jer and Anss\u00e2r, in order to consult with them about warding off the evil intentions of the enemies and opponents. A'bdu'llah B. Abu Sal\u00fbl's opinion was not to leave the town, and the majority of the companions coincided therewith. Salm\u00e2n F\u00e2rs\u00ee\\(^{310}\\) represented that whenever a numerous army approached a town in Persia, and the inhabitants were not strong enough to meet it, they usually dug a ditch around the town. This advice being approved of, preparations were made for the campaign. His lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014left Ebn Makt\u00fbm as his lieutenant in Madinah, conferred the banner of the Moh\u00e1jer upon Zayd B. H\u00e1rethah, and that of the Anss\u00e2r on Sa'd B. A'b\u00e2dah, and marched from Madinah with three thousand men, pitching his camp on the flank of a mountain near the town. Other portions of the vicinity of Madinah were obstructed by edifices and walls; but in the place where the camp had been established the excavation of a ditch became necessary. Accordingly orders, to which obedience was due, had been issued from the court of prophecy to the Musalmans to dig a fosse, his lordship first marking it with the line of direction and then dividing [the excavation of] it among his companions; according to a certain tradition, ten cubits were\n\n\\(^{310}\\) A Persian convert to Isl\u00e2m, mentioned in the chapter headed 'Something about Salm\u00e2n the Persian,' etc.\u2014See p. 261.\nallotted to each squad of ten men. His lordship being on good terms with the Bani Qoryttah Jews, spades, baskets, and other tools were borrowed from them, and the Musalmans began with all diligence to excavate the fosse, to carry soil, and to aid each other in the work. It is said that in those days Salm\u00e2n did as much work as ten other men, and there is a tradition that one day Qays B. Abu Ssa\u2019sa\u2019h struck Salman on the eye, so that he fainted and fell to the ground. When this matter reached the luminous mind of his lordship the best of men, he ordered Qays to perform the religious ablution for the sake of Salman, to wash the latter with the water of it, and then to place the vessel that contained it upside down on the back of Salman, which having been done, he was immediately delivered of his calamity.\n\nIt is related that on account of the coldness of the weather, and the famine and dearth which raged on that occasion, the professors of Islam had great trouble in digging the fosse, which they nevertheless completed within the space of six days, but confined their wives, children, and property within the strongholds of Madinah.\n\nBar\u00e2 B. Gh\u00e2r\u00e2b and J\u00e2ber B. A\u2019bdullah the Anss\u00e2ri relate that whilst digging the fosse the people met with a large and hard stone, upon which neither spade nor mattock could take effect, and that they were unable to break it. Accordingly the difficulty was reported to the prince of apostles\u2014u. w. b.\u2014who replied: \u2018I shall come myself,\u2019 although on account of hunger he felt his own blessed abdomen [hard?] as if a stone had been on it. As soon as the apostle of God had arrived near the stone he scattered the pieces thereof with powerful blows.\n\nIn the Mostaqadza it is related of O\u2019mar B. A\u2019wuf that he said: \u2018The apostle of God\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had repeatedly ordered me, and Salman, and Khodaifah, and Nu\u2019m\u00e2n, with six other Anss\u00e2r to excavate forty cubits of soil, but we met suddenly with a rock, in the digging out of which all our tools were broken. Accordingly I said to Salman: \u201cInform his lordship the apostle of this matter.\u201d He did so, and\nthe latter vouchsafed to come and to enter the ditch with Salm\u00e2n, while we other nine persons stood on the margin. His lordship took the pickaxe from the hand of Salm\u00e2n, and hit the stone so that it split, and lightning issued therefrom, which illuminated the whole of Madinah like a lamp in a dark room. Hereon his lordship shouted the \"Takbyr of victory,\" the Musalm\u00e2ns seconding him. After that he again struck the rock, and the same lightning gushed out. Then the Takbyr and the blow were given twice more, whereon Salm\u00e2n exclaimed: \"May my father and mother be a sacrifice for thee, O apostle of God! What is this, the like of which we have never seen before?\" The apostle turned to the people, and said: \"Have you seen what Salm\u00e2n has seen?\" They replied: \"Yes, O apostle of God!\" After that he continued: \"At the first blow I gave I saw by the lightning thereof the kiosks of Ssafla in Yemen, and Jebr\u00e2il informed me that my people shall take that country.\" In some other traditions we read that when his lordship struck the rock, and at each blow lightning issued, he asked his companions: 'Have you seen the light?' They answered: 'Yes, O apostle of God.' He continued: 'At the first luminousness I beheld the palaces of Syria, at the second the castles of Yemen, and at the third the white palace of Kesra.' Then he addressed Salm\u00e2n, and examined him about the peculiarities of the kiosk of Madayn. Salm\u00e2n replied: 'I swear by that God who has sent thee in truth, that whatever thou hast said about this palace coincides with the reality, and I testify that thou art the apostle of God.' His lordship then said to his companions: 'The dominion of my people will extend to that place, and afterwards the professors of Isl\u00e2m will conquer those regions.' The Musalm\u00e2ns rejoiced at this news, and said: 'Praise and glory be to God, who has vouchsafed to give us the promise of victory!' Salm\u00e2n says: 'I swear by God that after the [decease of the] prophet I saw everything fulfilled as he had predicted.'\n\nAbu Sofy\u00e2n\u2014being aware that the Bani Qoryttah Jews had made an alliance with the apostle not to aid his\nenemies, on condition that his lordship would likewise not injure themselves\u2014requested Hay B. Akhtt\u00e2b, when he was about to commence hostilities against the Musalm\u00e2ns, to go and to induce Ka'b B. Asa'd the chieftain by some means or other to break his promise, and to ally himself [with his people the Bani Qoryttah] to the opponents of the prince of apostles. Accordingly Hay B. Akhtt\u00e2b, being deluded by the words of Abu Sofy\u00e2n and tempted by Satan, placed his foot into the plain of aberration, went to the fort of Ka'b, and knocked at the gate. When the latter knew that Hay was at the portal of his stronghold, he said to himself: 'What am I to do to impede Hay from entering, for he is a cunning man, and will endeavour to persuade me to break my word?' Then he ordered the gatekeeper not to admit him. When Hay perceived that the door of hope was barred against him, he exclaimed: 'O Ka'b, open the gate of thy fort; I am Hay.' Ka'b replied: 'Hay, thou art an unhallowed man, and by thy malevolence the Bani An-natzyr have been dispersed and undone. Hast thou now come to destroy and to annihilate us also? Return; for we have made an alliance with Muhammad, which he has honestly confirmed. Heretofore we have experienced from him nothing but uprightness, truth, and love.' Hay rejoined: 'Open the door, that I may speak to thee. Wouldst thou withhold thy hospitality from me, not refresh me, and not even open the gate to me?' As among the Arabs no vice is considered more despicable than avarice, Ka'b was under the necessity of opening the door, and when Hay entered, he said: 'Ka'b, I bring thee tidings of felicity. The chiefs of the Arabs and the princes of the Qoraish have assembled in great numbers at Majma' Alass\u00e2l; the tribe Ghattaf\u00e2n, and besides them many others of the Azad and of the Asad leaders, have encircled the region of Ohod, and have made a league with each other that they will not return until they have destroyed Muhammad and his companions.' Ka'b replied: 'I swear by God that thou hast arrived contemptible and abject! Thou hast brought a cloud which\nwill not shed its water,\\textsuperscript{311} and contains nothing but thunder and lightning. Leave thou Muhammad alone, for we have experienced from him nothing but honesty and kindness.' Though in the beginning Ka'b returned answers like the words just recorded, that unfortunate man nevertheless succumbed at last to the cunning persuasion of Hay, swerving from the straight path, but uttered the following apprehension: 'I fear lest the Qoraish return to their own country without being able to injure Muhammad; thou also wilt return to thy country, and we shall be punished with death as a reward for what we have done.' Hay now swore by the Tor\u00e2tah [Pentateuch], and said: 'If the Qoraish and the Ghattaf\u00e2n return without attaining their object, I shall enter thy fort with thee, and be ready to suffer anything which may befall thee.' And that companion of the army of Eblis \\[i.e., Satan\\] used such cunning that the chieftain of the Qoryttah was deceived by his words, and tore the treaty to pieces which he had made with his lordship the Mussttafa\u2014u. w. b.\n\nWhen the impure mind of that base and accursed individual, \\[i.e., of Hay,\\] had been set at rest with reference to the Bani Qoryttah, he returned and informed the Qoraish of the success of his mission. When the information that the Jews had broken their covenant reached the exalted audition, the sublime mind was greatly affected, and, by the permission of his lordship the best of men, Zobeyr B. Ala'ww\u00e2m, went among the Bani Qoryttah to make inquiries on the subject, and brought on his return the news that they were engaged in collecting their animals and repairing their fort. After that Sa'd B. Moa'adh and Sa'd B. A'b\u00e2dah and A'bdullah B. Ru\u00e2hah went by order of the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014to the Bani Qoryttah to treat with them in case the above information should prove to be true. The just-mentioned individuals arrived among the Jews, and found them intent on enmity and contention; therefore they began first to advise Ka'b B. Asa'd, but without success, so that at last sharp words were exchanged\n\n\\textsuperscript{311} \\[I.e., thou hast made statements which will not be realized.\\]\nbetween him and Sa\u2019d B. A\u2019b\u00e2dah. After Sa\u2019d B. Moa\u2019adh had pacified Sa\u2019d B. A\u2019b\u00e2dah, all of them returned together to Madinah and informed the favourite of the Most High of what had taken place, whereon his lordship exclaimed: \u2018We trust in Allah, and He is a good advocate!\u2019\n\nWhen the information had spread among the Musalm\u00e2ns that those faithless people had broken their covenant, their fears and apprehensions increased. Meanwhile the cavalry of the idolaters began to make their appearance. M\u00e2lek B. A\u2019wuf and O\u2019tbah B. Hassyn, with the Bani Asad, the Ghattaf\u00e2n and the Bani Qor\u00e2rah, arrived from the upper part of the W\u00e2di, which is situated east of Madinah, and the Qoraish, with the Bani Kan\u00e2nah, became visible at the extremity of the W\u00e2di. The hearts of the weak among the Musalm\u00e2ns failed them, and their eyes were dazzled at the aspect of the formidable multitude of the enemy, as God the Most High has said: \u2018When they came against you from above you and below you, and when [your] sight became troubled and [your] hearts came even to [your] throats [for fear], and ye imagined of Allah [various] imaginations. Then were the faithful tried, and made to tremble a violent trembling.\u2019312 Moghaytt B. Qasrah, who was one of the hypocrites, said on the occasion of the siege: \u2018Muhammad is promising that the treasures of the Qayssar and the Kesra will fall to our lot, and now we have not even a chance to go out to answer the calls of nature; therefore the promises made to us by Allah and by His apostle are but lies and falsehoods.\u2019 God has said: \u2018And when the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts was an infirmity, said, Allah and His apostle have made you no other than a fallacious promise.\u2019313 A number of hypocrites were persuading the Musalm\u00e2ns to return to their houses and not to follow his lordship the apostle\u2014u. w. b. Accordingly some of them waited on his lordship, asking for permission to return to their habitations, on the pretence that they were empty [of people] and that the enemy might enter and plunder them. On this subject God the Most\n\n312 Qur\u00e2\u00f1, ch. xxxiii, 10, 11. 313 Ibid., 12.\nHigh revealed the following verse: 'And when a party of them said, O inhabitants of Yathrab, there is no place [of security] for you [here]; wherefore return [home]. And a part of them asked leave of the prophet [to depart], saying, Verily our houses are defenceless [and exposed to the enemy]; but they were not defenceless, [and] their intention was no other than to flee.'\n\nWhen the idolaters arrived near the bank of the ditch they were astonished, because that custom had not been in use in the Arab country. Then they commenced besieging the professors of Isl\u00e2m, and hostilities began on both sides by fighting and shooting arrows. During the contest the infidels endeavoured to approach the tent of his lordship the apostle, but were unable to cross the ditch, from which some valiant men were keeping them off. It is related that on account of the haste wherewith the Musalm\u00e2ns had been working, one of the sides of the ditch had been left unfinished, and that for fear the idolaters might find an entrance by it into the camp, his lordship was accustomed nightly to watch it in his own sacred person, and the cold being intense at that time, his lordship went every time he felt chilly to A'ayshah to warm his blessed body, and again returned to his post. Nor did his lordship suffer such hardships in any other Ghazwah as in 'the War of the Ditch,' because in those days there was great scarcity of victuals, famine prevailed among the Musalm\u00e2ns, and the weather was very inclement. Nevertheless, for the sake of relieving the distress of his companions, his lordship the receptacle of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014found it expedient to give one-third of the produce of Madinah to the Ghattaf\u00e2n and to the Qor\u00e2rah to induce them to return, and thus to cause a division in the army of the idolaters. O'tbah B. Hassyn and H\u00e1reth B. A'wuf, who were the chiefs of those people, agreed to make peace, and were for the completion of the treaty admitted into the assembly of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014Dhun-n\u00fbryn being ordered to write the treaty;\n\n314 Qur\u00e2n. ch. xxxiii. 13. 315 Custom of excavating ditches.\nbut before this was confirmed by witnesses the prince of existences found it convenient to consult Sa\u2019d B. Moa\u2019adh and Sa\u2019d B. A\u2019badah, both of whom spoke as follows: \u2018O apostle of God, if the affair of the treaty of peace be commanded by Divine revelation, we hear and obey; but if it be based on other considerations pray inform us?\u2019 His lordship replied: \u2018Divine revelation has nothing to do with this matter, but as I saw that the Arab tribes are, as it were, all shooting arrows from the same bow at you, I thought that by making peace with a portion of them I would produce a division among the infidels, and lessen their power.\u2019 The two Sa\u2019ds continued: \u2018O apostle of God, at the time when we and they were as yet idolaters they never aspired to the possession of a single date from our palm-groves except as guests. Why should we at present, when we have been exalted to the honour of following thee, submit to such humiliation and become liable to such baseness? We swear by Allah that we shall not give them anything except [blows with our] swords, until God the Most High decides between us and them.\u2019\n\nAccordingly, at a sign from his lordship the apostle, Sa\u2019d B. Moa\u2019adh tore the treaty to pieces, whereon the chiefs of the Ghattafan and of the Qorarah left the august assembly disappointed and awed.\n\nW\u0101qidi says that O\u2019tbah and H\u0101reth had come into the most noble assembly for the purpose of completing the treaty of peace, and were sitting therein, when Asyd B. Khadzyr, fully armed and equipped in iron and steel, hastened to wait on the refuge of termination, and perceived O\u2019tbah sitting [contrary to etiquette] with outstretched legs in the presence of his lordship. Asyd knew not what had been written, but, being angry at O\u2019tbah\u2019s incivility, addressed him as follows: \u2018O thou eye of a fox\u2019s pup, draw in thy legs; for it is unbecoming to stretch them out, and to sit thus in the assembly of the apostle\u2014u. w. b. By Allah! if it were not for the respect due to the presence of the apostle, I would pierce both thy sides with one arrow.\u2019 The rest of the words of Asyd expressed\nhis dissent from the proposed treaty, and resembled those recorded above of Sa\u2019d B. Moa\u2019adh. His lordship thereon ordered the agreement to be torn to pieces. O\u2019tbah, being disappointed, now rose and said: \u2018It would have been better for you to yield some of the dates of Madinah than to expose yourself to the hardship of war, because you have neither the patience nor the strength to cope with our tribes.\u2019 Asyd retorted: \u2018O\u2019tbah, threatenest thou us with the sword? It will soon appear whether you or we will lament. I swear by Allah that if I were not restrained by the respect due to the assembly of the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014you would not return.\u2019 Then his holy and prophetic lordship said in a loud voice to the Ghattafan chiefs: \u2018Return to your people, for between you and us the sword alone will decide.\u2019 It is related that when those who had coveted the dates of Madinah had witnessed the unanimity and firmness of the Anss\u00e2r they were confounded, and returned to the Qoraish with empty bags.\n\nDeath of A\u2019mru B. A\u2019bdud, and its Consequences.\n\nThe biographers of the lord of the righteous narrate that A\u2019mru B. A\u2019bdud was distinguished among the Arab tribes by his great impetuosity, perfect bravery, and skill in handling all the arms of war, so that if Rustam Dast\u00e2n [the celebrated Persian hero] had attacked him he would have been defeated, and had Shohr\u00e2b [another hero] stepped into the list of contention with him he would have succumbed. The celebrity of A\u2019mru for valour was such that the Arab warriors considered him a match for one thousand combatants. The writer of these lines has heard Sayyid A\u2019li Najfi\u2014Allah have mercy on him\u2014utter the following words: \u2018I have read in a book that when A\u2019mru B. A\u2019bdud had in the Ghazwah of the Confederates crossed the ditch and shouted for a champion, none of the companions had come forward, whereon his lordship asked: \u201cWhy do you hesitate?\u201d Thereon O\u2019mar B. Alkhatt\u00e2b opened his mouth with excuses on the part of the pro-\nfessors of Islam, and addressed his lordship the best of men as follows: \"On a certain occasion we were with a number of the Qoraish, among whom was also A'mru B. A'bdud, travelling to Syria for the purpose of trading, and had a great quantity of goods, when all of a sudden about a thousand brigands barred the road against us, so that the owners of the caravan were in dread not only of losing their merchandise, but also their lives. When A'mru B. A'bdud had taken cognizance of this state of affairs, he unsheathed his sword, and, snatching up a piece of carpet for a shield, attacked the robbers like a furious lion, and put them all to flight, whereon the caravan continued its journey in safety.\"\n\nIt is related that A'mru, having received a serious wound on the day of Bedr, had fled, and could not be present at the battle of Ohod. In the Ghazwah of the Confederates, however, he was desirous of making good his omission, and so recovering his old prestige, so that his name might again become celebrated among the Arabs, and his fame spread near and far. Accordingly one day, when the idolaters had got ready for a battle, and had reached the brink of the ditch, A'mru B. A'bdud, with a number of valiant Arabs\u2014such as Dhur\u00e2r B. Alkhatt\u00e2b, and Akramah B. Abu Jahl, and Naofel B. A'bdullah, and Hobeyrah B. Wohob, all of whom acknowledged A'mru's superiority\u2014had discovered a narrow spot in the ditch, over which they leapt with their horses. In the Randztu-l-dhb\u00e2b it is recorded that Khaled B. Wolyd and Abu Sofy\u00e2n B. Harb were with the Qoraish infidels, and Kan\u00e2nah with the Bani Ghattaf\u00e2n, drawn up in battle array on the bank of the ditch, and remained stationary. A'mru asked Abu Sofy\u00e2n: 'Are you not also coming over like ourselves?' The latter replied: 'If it should become necessary to cross over, we shall also do it.' As soon as A'mru had leapt over the fosse he stepped into the lists of bravery and exuberance and shouted for a champion; but as the professors of Islam knew his bravery, fear paralyzed them, as if it had chased out all the blood from their bodies, and they remained standing motionless,\nwith their heads hanging down 'as if they had birds on them,' which words allude to the circumstance that in Arabia many camels are affected with scabs, which the crows remove with their beaks, so that when they are engaged in this operation the camel remains quiet for fear of scaring away the crows and thus retaining the scabs.\n\nIn short, when A'mru B. A'bdud challenged the professors of Isl\u00e2m to send him a champion, and no one came forward, his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014exclaimed: 'Is there a friend who will oppose the wickedness of this enemy of God?' Then A'li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014replied: 'O apostle of God, I shall fight him!' His lordship answered nothing; but according to another tradition he said: 'This is A'mru B. A'bdud!' The latter shouted for a second time, whereon A'li Murtadza over again asked for permission to attack him, but did not obtain it. A'mru now exclaimed for the third time: 'Is there no man among you who will step into the lists?' A'li then again asked to be allowed to fight him, and this time the prophet said: 'I permit it, O A'li!' When the former approached the latter, he handed to him the sword of God, surnamed Dhu-l-fiq\u00e2r, and put his own cuirass on him to protect his joy-bringing person from the javelins of misfortune. For the purpose of averting the evil eye,\\(^{316}\\) he gave him his own turban, and it is recorded in the Mostaqadza that, when he wrapped it round his head, he said: 'O God, protect him from him!'\u2014i.e., protect A'li from A'mru. According to another tradition he raised his blessed hands, saying: 'O great God, Thou hast taken from me O'baydah on the day of Bedr, and Hamzah Thou hast separated from me on the day of Ohod! O God, this is A'li, my brother and my cousin!' He also said: 'Do not destroy us one by one. Thou art the best of inheritors!' When his lordship the apostle had come to\n\n\\(^{316}\\) Literally A'ynu-l-Kam\u00e2l, 'eye of perfection' which is so maleficent that it can injure a person from a distance. See on this subject 'The Evil Eye, Amulets, etc.,' by E. Rehatsek, in the 'Journal of the Bombay Branch, Royal Asiatic Society,' vol. x., p. 299 seqq., 1875.\nthese words, A'li, the Amir of the true Believers\u2014u. w. b.\u2014advanced on foot, met A'mru on horseback on the battle-field, and said to him: 'A'mru, I have heard that thou hast said, \"No one shall invite me to do three things without my undertaking to do one or all three of them.\"'\n\nA'mru replied: 'Yes, such is the case.' A'li continued: 'I invite thee to testify that there is no God but Allah, and to worship Him who is the Creator of men.' A'mru replied: 'Good cousin, let us put off this matter for another time.'\n\nA'li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014continued: 'I have another request. If thou comply therewith, it will be good for thee.' A'mru asked: 'What is it?' A'li the Commander of the Faithful said: 'Abstain from fighting against the professors of Islam, return to thy country, and promise to aid Muhammad if he prevails over his enemies, but to let events take their course without interfering or enmity on thy part if the contrary takes place.'\n\nA'mru replied: 'The Qoraish women will say that, though I was able to keep my vow, I failed to do so, and returned home.' A'mru had, after his flight from the battle-field of Bedr, made a vow that he would not anoint himself with oil until he had slain his prophetic lordship.\n\nAfter hearing the refusal of A'mru, A'li the Amir of the true Believers said: 'There is yet another request.' A'mru asked: 'What is it?' The Commander of the Faithful said: 'That thou alight from thy horse to fight with me.'\n\nAt these words A'mru laughed, and exclaimed: 'I never thought an Arab warrior would ask that from me. Return! Thou art yet young, and the time has not come for thee to enter the lists of contention with men.' According to another tradition, he said: 'Return, and let one of those two Qoraish Sheikhs\u2014namely, Abu Bakr or O'mar\u2014come.'\n\nHe is also said to have uttered the following words: 'There are older men among thy uncles. Return thou in peace.'\n\nThe tradition of [other] biographers is that A'mru said: 'I dislike to shed thy blood, especially as friendship had subsisted between thy father and me.' The Commander of the Faithful rejoined: 'If thou dislikest to shed my\nblood, I like to shed thine!\u2019 At these words A\u2019mru became incensed, alighted from his horse, stood up in front of it, and, with a drawn sword in his hand, kept gazing steadily at A\u2019li the Commander of the Faithful, who covered his head with his shield, which, however, that dauntless warrior cleft in twain with one blow of his sword which might have split a rocky mountain. When the scimitar of that wicked infidel broke the shield, it grazed the blessed head of the Em\u00e2n of the pious a little. Hereon that lion of attack eased with one stroke of the Dhu-l-fiq\u00e2r the body of that wretch from the burden of his head.\n\nLet it not remain hidden that the account just given of the duel with A\u2019mru B. A\u2019bdud has been transcribed from biographical works. We also read in some chronicles that before the Lord A\u2019li and A\u2019mru had begun to fight, they made arrangements that neither of them should be succoured by anyone. They fought from forenoon till sunset without being able to vanquish each other. After the contest had thus been protracted, A\u2019li Murtadza said to A\u2019mru: \u2018Have we not agreed that no one should come to my or to thy aid?\u2019 A\u2019mru asked: \u2018Then what has happened?\u2019 A\u2019li replied: \u2018See, thy brother is coming behind thee!\u2019 Accordingly, A\u2019mru looked to his rear, and thus his lordship the Commander of the Faithful snatched an opportunity to strike that accursed man in such a way with his sabre as to separate his thigh from his body. Hereon A\u2019mru exclaimed: \u2018Boy, thou hast deceived me!\u2019 But the lord and receptacle of victory exclaimed: \u2018War is a deception!\u2019 Then A\u2019mru threw his severed thigh towards the Amir of the Faithful, whereon that prince of saints amputated his head, and turned to other antagonists.\n\nIt is related that after slaying A\u2019mru, A\u2019li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014shouted the Takbyr; his lordship the apostle recognised the voice, and knew what had taken place. It is related that after the death of A\u2019mru, Dhur\u00e2rah B. Alkhatt\u00e2b and Hobeyrah B. Abu Wohob approached A\u2019li, who was ready to encounter them, but as soon as the eye of Dhur\u00e2rah caught sight of the lion of attack, he preferred\nflight to permanency, and being asked afterwards for the reason of his having fled so hastily, he replied: 'Because I had seen the figure of death with my own eyes.' Hobeyrah, nevertheless, stood for some time opposite to the Amir, but at last also fled, and whilst Naofel B. A'bdullah Kakhzumi retreated he was thrown from his saddle into the ditch, where the Musalmans stoned him, and he cried: 'It would be better to kill me [at once].' Accordingly his lordship the Amir [i.e., A'li] took pity on him, entered the ditch, and cut him in twain with one stroke of his blade. It is said that when A'li the Amir of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014cut off the head of A'mru, he failed to take notice of his cuirass, which was very elegant. When A'mru's sister arrived on the spot, and saw that his arms as well as his accoutrements had remained untouched, she exclaimed: 'He can have been slain only by a noble-hearted peer!'\n\nIn short, A'li the Commander of the Faithful burnt the granaries of life of the enemies with the fire of his wrath, and returned with a countenance joyous like the lamp of the firmament to the lord of apostleship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and threw the head of A'mru B. A'bdud down at the blessed feet of his lordship, chanting with his wonderfully eloquent tongue some distichs, the last of which are the following:\n\nThe worshippers of stone, their folly I have seen;\nThe worshippers of the Lord of Muhammad and their rectitude;\nWill not God consider their religion,\nAnd their intention, O ye confederates?\n\nIt is related in biographical works that the apostle of God\u2014u. w. b.\u2014said with reference to the lion of God: 'The prowess of A'li on the day of the ditch was more excellent than the acts of my people [will be] till the day of the resurrection.' It is on record that when A'li the Commander of the Faithful waited upon his lordship the apostle, Abu Bakr and O'mar rose and kissed his head, whereon A'bdullah E. Masu'd exclaimed: 'God has caused A'li to fight for the Believers, and God is most high and wise.'\n\nWhen Dhur\u00e2r B. Alkhattab and Akramah B. Abu Jahl fled from the battle, joined their army, and informed it of\nthe murder of A'mru B. A'bdud and Naofel B. A'bdullah, Abu Sofy\u00e2n fled with the Qoraish and the tribe Ghattaf\u00e2n, nor did they halt in any place till they arrived in A'qyq, whence they sent a man to buy the corpses of A'mru and of Naofel. His lordship said: 'We have no need of their wicked bodies. Let them be taken away.' The same or the next day the idolaters started together from A'qyq to Madinah. On the other hand, the Bani Qoryttah Jews, who had broken their covenant, grew bold, and fought in every direction. Only contests with arrows took place, however, between the antagonists, who were skirmishing from dawn till sunset along the banks of the ditch. Abu Sofy\u00e2n had stationed a detachment opposite to the tent of the apostle, so that the professors of Isl\u00e2m had no chance to move from their position. It is said that the battle raged so hotly on that day as to hinder the Musalm\u00e2ns from holding their noon and afternoon prayers. But when the carnage had terminated, Bell\u00e2l was ordered to call the people to prayers in the usual manner, whereon the professors of Isl\u00e2m congregated and made good their omission. According to a tradition of the Amir of the Faithful, the apostle of God said on that occasion: 'Allah has filled their houses and tombs with fire because they have kept us away from the middle and from the post-meridian prayers till sunset.' Meanwhile Na'y\u00e2m B. Masu'd Ghattaf\u00e2ni waited, in consequence of the boundless mercy of God, upon the apostle, made his profession of the Faith and of obedience, so that afterwards, by a single stratagem of his, the chain of union between the idolaters and the Bani Qoryttah Jews was snapped, and the lamp of prosperity, which was apparently burning, became extinguished by the tempest of Divine wrath. The detailed circumstances of this affair are as follows: Na'y\u00e2m B. Masu'd Ashja'y, who had spread the carpet of love between himself and the Qoraish, and also the Bani Qoryttah Jews, felt a yearning for Isl\u00e2m in his heart, so that he waited between evening and bedtime upon the prince of the righteous\u2014u. w. b. When the apostle asked\nhim for the reason of his visit, he replied: 'I come to trouble thee, because I believe in the truth of thy apostolate, and will do anything for thee. I bear witness to the truth of what thou sayest, O apostle of Allah. The people are not aware of my faith in Isl\u00e2m, and believe what I say. I swear that I shall do whatever thou commandest.' His lordship asked: 'Art thou able to throw discord among the infidels and to destroy their league?' He replied: 'I can; but thou must allow me to speak whatever I like.' His lordship permitted him to do so, and dismissed him with the words: 'War is a deception.' Then he went to the Bani Qoryttah Jews, and said: 'You know the sincerity of my affection and the perfect love I bear towards you.' They assented, and Na'ym continued: 'The Qoraish and the Ghattaf\u00e2n have come to attack Muhammad, and you aid and abet their intentions, although you have no connection with them, because their country is distant. If they vanquish Muhammad they will have accomplished their object. But consider that your own habitations are near, and that your families, goods, chattels, are here, and that if perchance the Arab tribes get tired of war and depart without having defeated Muhammad, they will abandon you to his vengeance and that of his companions, who will utterly extirpate you for having broken your covenant with the Musalm\u00e2ns.' The Jews replied: 'Thou hast shown affection and kindness, but what can we do in this matter?' Na'ym continued: 'It will be proper for you first of all to take hostages from among the principal Qoraish and the nobles of the Ghattaf\u00e2n, and then to wage war against Muhammad. The reason for this step is, that in case they should be frustrated in their aim, and intend to return to their country, and Muhammad were to attack you, they would be compelled to afford you their aid for the sake of protecting their chiefs, and would thus keep off the impending catastrophe from you.' The Jews replied: 'What thou hast said is perfectly just and right. We shall act up to thy advice.' After Na'ym had thus relieved his mind\nabout the Bani Qoryttah Jews, he met the Qoraish princes and played off another stratagem, by first assuring them of his affection and devotedness, and then saying: 'You know the enmity and hatred I have vowed against Muhammad and his companions, but I possess information about the Bani Qoryttah, which I shall impart to you on condition that you keep it secret, and reveal it not to any of them.' The Qoraish agreed, and he continued: 'Let it be known to you that the Jews have repented of their having broken their treaty with Muhammad, and have sent him a message that if he could pardon them they would surrender into his power a number of Qoraish and Ghattafan chiefs under the pretence of keeping them as hostages, but really for the purpose of their decapitation, and that after this they would join his army and unite therewith to attack the rest. Muhammad, on his part, agreed that the breach might be made good by this means.' According to another tradition, Na'ym said to the idolaters: 'I was in the assembly of the Bani Qoryttah when their courier returned from Muhammad and brought the news that he was inclined for peace.' According to another, he said to the idol-worshippers: 'You know that Muhammad never lies, and I heard him utter the following words: \"Peace is to be established between me and the Bani Qoryttah, on condition that we give leave to the Bani An-natzyr to return to their habitations, and that they themselves, on their part, surrender to us the hostages they will receive from the Qoraish.\"' At all events, Na'ym did his best to persuade them not to give any hostages if requested by the Bani Qoryttah to do so. After that this intelligent and cunning man left the Qoraish, visited the Ghattafan, and said to them what he had said to all the other idolaters. The day on which Na'ym imparted to them that heart-burning information happened to be a Friday, and it made such an impression on the mind of Abu Sofyan that he sent a person to the Bani Qoryttah with the message: 'Our stay in this country has been long, and our quadrupeds are lost. We must, therefore, make preparations this evening for a\nbattle, and to-morrow attack the enemy together; because we may possibly advance our interests in this way.' The Jews replied: 'To-morrow is the Sabbath, and on that day we do no work. You also know that some of our ancestors have been grievously punished for transacting business on that day. We are, nevertheless, at all times ready to aid you against the enemy, if you will surrender some nobles of your people into our power, because we apprehend that, if the siege be protracted to some length, you will be disinclined to stay, and will return, thus leaving us at the mercy of Muhammad and his companions. If, however, the chiefs of your nation are with us when you intend to depart, and Muhammad purposes to take vengeance on us, you will be compelled to aid us [for the sake of your chiefs].' When the infidels had heard this answer of the Jews they unanimously exclaimed: 'What Na'ym B. Masu'd has said is nothing but the truth.' Accordingly, they sent another message to the Bani Qoryttah of the following purport: 'We shall give you none of our people. If you come forward and fight, it will be well; but if not, we shall return to our country and leave you to make up your difference with Muhammad as best you may.' The Jews then said: 'By Allah! Na'ym has spoken the truth. We have nothing at all to do with Muhammad, and shall not fight him.' After discord had thus been thrown among the opponents by Divine will, and by the stratagem of Na'ym B. Masu'd Ghattaf\u00e2ni, they returned dismayed and confused to their own places and habitations from the vicinity of Madinah.\n\nJ\u00e2ber B. A'bdullah the Anss\u00e2ri says: 'His worship the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014prayed three consecutive days to the Lord of unity for the flight of the confederates. This request was responded to on a Wednesday between the two prayers of the latter part of the day, and the Boundless Giver sent a hurricane which shook and confused their army so that even the tent-pegs of the infidels were uprooted, and their pots turned over. Every raw intention they had entertained remained unmatured, so that they\nreturned disappointed and hopeless to their country.' Some say that Allah the Most High and Glorious had sent an angel to pull out the pegs from the tents of the professors of darkness and to extinguish their fires, so that they had no other remedy but flight, and the blessed verse, 'O true believers, remember the favour of Allah towards you when armies of infidels came against you, and we sent against them a wind, and hosts [of angels] which ye saw not, and Allah beheld that which ye did,'\\textsuperscript{317} confirms the event which produced such effects.\n\nConcerning the angels there is a tradition of Muhammad Ebn Esah\u00e2q to the following purport: In the mosque of Kufah a young man said to Khodayfah Alyemeny: 'O Abu A'bdullah, blessed are ye who have seen the prophet of Allah! Had we been able to meet his lordship, we would have become as the dust on the road to get him to place his foot on us.' Khodayfah, however, became angry at these words, and said: 'Thou liest! For ere this better men than you have been in the service of the prophet of Allah, and have not acted in that way.' Then he began to narrate the events of the night of the Confederates, and said: 'I swear by God, during that night we suffered so much misery and hunger that God the Most High and Glorious is alone aware of it. During that night his holy and prophetic lordship rose from sleep, performed several prayer-flexions, and said: \"Is there anyone who will bring information about the people, that Allah the Most High may make him my companion in paradise?\"' Khodayfah continues: 'But on account of our intense hunger and fear of [exposing ourselves to] the cold, not one of us responded to the call of his lordship. Accordingly, he again prayed, and then repeated his question, which had not been responded to. Then he called three or four men by name, and some noble and excellent companions report that they answered as follows: \"We take refuge with God and His prophet from this misery, to rouse us up from our place and to send us to another.\" When, however, he called out\n\n\\textsuperscript{317} Qur\u00e2n, ch. xxxiii. 9.\nmy name, I replied: \"I await thy commands, O apostle of God!\" Then he asked: \"Canst thou this night watch over us, to be with us in the morn of the resurrection?\" I said: \"Yes, O apostle of God, I hear and obey.\" In some traditions it is related that Khodayfah said: 'When the apostle of God first challenged his companions no one rose, though I was also among those addressed. But when he at last called me, and I complied, he said: \"Khodayfah, what hindered thee from rising, although thou hast heard my words?\" I replied: \"Hunger and cold, O apostle of God.\" At these words his lordship smiled, and said: \"Come nearer.\" I obeyed, and his lordship rubbed his blessed hand on my breast and between my shoulders, uttering with his wonderfully eloquent tongue the words: \"O Lord God, protect him from those who are before and behind him, and from those on his right or left side.\" According to another tradition, he added: 'And from those who are above and below him.' 'And, by God! the fear of hunger and cold abandoned me. After that his lordship said: \"Go among the people, and bring me information about them, in what state they are, and thou must do nothing until thou hast seen me.\" Khodayfah continues: 'Accordingly I took my arms and crossed the ditch, but felt so warm that I fancied I had entered a bath. When I arrived near the idolaters I concealed myself in the rear of a tree, and perceived that they had, with a thousand stratagems, kindled a fire for Abu Sofy\u0101n, as the wind and storm were raging in their camp beyond all conception. Abu Sofy\u0101n turned sometimes one, and sometimes the other, side to the fire to warm it, and I had a mind to shoot an arrow at him; but the injunction of the apostle restrained me. I also beheld A'lqamah B. A'll\u0101mah, who shouted: \"O family of A'ass, the wind and frost are killing me.\" After that the army of God came, projecting large stones, which, however, the idolaters warded off with their shields. Then the fires of the idolaters were extinguished by the tornado of calamity, and their hearts withered by the blasts of misery. Abu Sofy\u0101n, moved by what was taking place, exclaimed: \"O\nQoraish people, our sojourn in this region was long, and our cattle have perished, the Bani Qoryttah have shown us enmity, our weapons have become useless, and this wind distresses us much; accordingly, I take my departure.\" Then he went to his camel, and, being in great haste, he mounted it without untying its legs. On that occasion A'kramah B. Abu Jahl exclaimed: \"O Abu Sofy\u00e2n, thou art the chief of the people! Where art thou going and leaving them in this calamity?\" Abu Sofy\u00e2n then alighted from shame and confusion, loosed the knees of his camel, took the bridle in his hand, walked through the camp, and shouted: \"Make haste to march!\" Accordingly all the Qoraish, the Ghattaf\u00e2n, the Kan\u00e2nah, and the Qor\u00e2rah departed in grief and disappointment, so that not one of the infidels, who had come with designs upon the property and lives of the Musalm\u00e2ns, remained in that region.\n\nKhodayfah says: 'When the enemies were engaged in loading [their baggage on the cattle] I departed, and on my way I perceived twenty cavaliers with white turbans, and two of them said to me: \"Tell thy master that God the Most High has warded off from him the wickedness of his enemies.\" When I arrived in camp, in my old place, I again felt cold as before. I found his lordship at prayers, and he beckoned to me with his hand to come nearer. I obeyed. His lordship had a very broad and big piece of cloth, a corner whereof he put upon me, whereon I became so warm that I fell asleep. When he had finished his prayers he said: \"Arise, O sleeper!\" Then I awoke and narrated to him all I had seen.'\n\nIt is related that after the flight of the opponents his holy and prophetic lordship turned to his companions and said: 'After this they will not come to fight you, but you will wage war against them.' Accordingly, the Qoraish obtained no other opportunity to attack the Musalm\u00e2ns, so that at last the apostle of God marched with the army of Isl\u00e2m to Mekkah, conquered that blessed region, and vanquished his antagonists, as will be narrated in these pages if it pleaseth Allah the Most High.\nSome Events and several Miracles that took place during the Time of the War of the Ditch.\n\nAmong the incidents of the war of the ditch that which happened to Sa\u2019d B. Moa\u2019adh, is described as follows: A\u2019ayshah\u2014may Allah reward her!\u2014said: \u2018In those days the enemies had on a certain occasion arrived opposite the apostle of God, and were engaged in fighting. At that time I was with the mother of Sa\u2019d B. Moa\u2019adh in the H\u00e2rethah-fort, which is one of the best strongholds of Madinah, when my eye suddenly alighted on Sa\u2019d B. Moa\u2019adh, who was passing by dressed in a short coat of mail, which was insufficient to protect either his arms or legs, he being a man of tall stature and corpulent. I was sorry for the imperfections of this cuirass, but his mother said: \u201cMake haste to meet the apostle of God, for thou hast been so tardy that thou art now very far from his lordship.\u201d I said: \u201cOmm Sa\u2019d, how would it be if thy son had armour sufficient to cover his body?\u201d His mother replied: \u201cGod foreordaineth what He liketh.\u201d And he was predestined to attain martyrdom by an arrow-wound. Accordingly, when Sa\u2019d had reached the bank of the ditch, Jan\u00e2n B. Alu\u2019rfah shot an arrow at him, saying: \u2018Take that! I am the son of Alu\u2019rfah!\u2019 According to another tradition, Sa\u2019d exclaimed: \u2018May Allah burn thy face with fire!\u2019 That arrow had, however, struck his eye and broke off. When he saw that the wound was a dangerous one he turned to the Qiblah of prayer, uttering the words: \u2018O God, if Thy apostle is again to have a war with the Qoraish, then deliver me from the grasp of death, because I love nothing more than to fight a nation that accuses the apostle of falsehood, and has expelled him from the sanctuary of Mekkah; or else respite me till I behold the Bani Qoryttah in misery, according to my heart\u2019s desire.\u2019 His prayer was responded to, the blood ceased to flow from his wound, and he lived to fight against the Bani Qoryttah, whereon his wound opened again, so that he died, as will be narrated further on.\nIn the Moa'jum Ttur\u00e1ni it is related that in the war of the ditch there was a young man present who had just married, and had in the middle of the day requested the lord of the pious and model of the righteous to [allow him to] pay a visit to his family. After obtaining permission, this young man put on his armour and departed. When he reached his house he beheld his wife standing among a number of men, and in the exuberance of his jealousy he assaulted her, whereon the poor woman said: 'Do nothing till thou seest what is in the house.' He accordingly forbore to slay his wife, and stepped into his house, where he beheld a snake coiled up on his bed, which he forthwith snatched off with his lance and went out. The serpent struggled awhile on the top of the spear and expired, but the young man likewise died, and no one knew whether he had first expired or the reptile. When this event was brought to the notice of his holy and prophetic lordship \u2014u. w. b.\u2014he said: 'Plead for pardon for your companion.' Then he added: 'In Madinah there are a number of serpents who have made profession of the Faith. If you obtain cognizance of one of them do not approach it [to kill it] for three days, but if it shows itself after that time to you, then kill it, because it is a devil.'\n\nLet it not remain hidden to the intelligent that it is not possible to narrate all the events of the war of the ditch in this abridgment, and that therefore the musky reed will briefly record only two miracles, confirmed by two truthful witnesses, to establish the claim of his holy and prophetic lordship [to thaumaturgy]; but glory pertains to Allah, and grace comes from Him.\n\nThe first miracle is, according to the biographers of the prophet, recorded in the following tradition, which they possess, of J\u00e1ber B. A\u2019bdullah the Anss\u00e1ri, who said: 'In those days, when we were engaged in digging the trench, I perceived one day the signs of hunger on the blessed countenance of his lordship. I therefore went to my house, where I had kept a fat kid which might afford a slender repast. This kid I slaughtered and placed the flesh\ninto a pot with the intention of regaling the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014therewith. I also ground one measure of barley into flour and ordered it to be leavened. Then I departed from my house and made haste to wait on his lordship. I informed him that I had prepared some food, and expressed my hope that he would condescend to be my guest. His lordship asked: \"How much food is there?\" I stated the amount, and his lordship said: \"Very well.\" He added: \"Go and tell thy wife not to take away the pot from the fire, nor the bread out from the oven.\" This is narrated in the *Raudzatu-l-ahb\u00e2b*, according to which J\u00e2ber also said: 'After that he invited those at the ditch, exclaiming: \"J\u00e2ber has prepared some food for you. Come!\"' Accordingly I went home, and said to my wife: \"Woe betide thee! The apostle of God is coming with a number of the people of the ditch!\" She asked: \"Is his lordship aware of the quantity of food we have?\" I said: \"Yes.\" She replied: \"God and His apostle know better.\" When the apostle of Allah arrived in our house he gave a signal, whereon the people entered in crowds. He approached in his own holy person the pot and the leaven, throwing into each of them some of the saliva of his Kawther-like mouth, invoking a benediction thereon from the Lord of glory. Then he ordered me to put the bread into the oven, and when it was baked he took it out, and having likewise poured into a dish the soup with the meat, he seated ten men around it, who partook of the repast and were filled. In this manner he satisfied the hunger of nearly one thousand men, and when he left the pot and the oven he ordered us to cover the apertures of both. After returning to them we found the oven again full of bread and the pot of meat, as before, and by order of his lordship we ate our fill, and sent some food also to our neighbours. When, however, the apostle had left the house with the people of the ditch, the food had likewise been consumed.' Some relate that J\u00e2ber had spoken as follows: 'By order of the prophet\n\n318 This is the name of a river in Paradise, and also the title of ch. cviii. of the Qur\u00e2n.\nwe took the bread from the oven and the flesh from the pot, distributing the food among the men till they were all filled and went away; the bread, however, and the meat remained as before.\\(^{319}\\)\n\nThe second miracle was as follows, according to the traditions of Waqidi and Muhammad E. Esah\u00e2q: It is related that the daughter of Bashir B. Sa\u2019d has said: \u2018My mother, the daughter of Ru\u00e2hah, gave me one measure of dates, telling me to take them to my father and uncle for dinner. While I was going in search of them the apostle of God perceived me, and said: \u201cCome here, my little girl.\u201d When I reached him, he asked: \u201cWhat hast thou here?\u201d I said: \u201cI have some dates to carry to my father.\u201d The apostle of God stretched forth his hand, and I placed some dates on his blessed palm. He then ordered me to spread out a cloth, into which he wrapped the dates, and ordered a man to exclaim: \u201cCome, all ye people of the ditch.\u201d The man obeyed, whereon all the people came, and ate as much of those dates as they liked. Then they departed; but still dates enough remained to fall over the borders of the cloth.\u2019 Let it not remain hidden and concealed to the intelligent that the wonders and miracles which took place in those times are numerous, and that they are recorded in biographies and chronicles.\n\nThe siege is by some stated to have lasted twenty-seven, and according to the Seir Kazr\u00e2ni twenty-four days. According to a trustworthy book, it appears that the opponents departed from the vicinity of Madinah after a siege of twenty-nine days. It is said that in the Ghazwah of the Ditch six men of the Anss\u00e2r attained the glory of martyrdom, and in some biographies their names are recorded as follows: Sa\u2019d B. Moa\u2019adh, and Anus B. Awus, and A\u2019bdullah B. Sohal, and Ttofayl B. An-nu\u2019m\u00e2n, and\n\n\\(^{319}\\) This story has probably been told so as to put Muhammad on a par with Eli\u00e2s [Elijah] and \u00dd\u2019sa [Jesus].\u2014See Part I., vol. ii., of this work, pp. 31, 169. According to tradition Moslems believe that their prophet worked miracles, but it appears from the Qur\u00e2\u0144 that he claimed no such power.\nKa'b Zayd. Of the idolaters three individuals departed to the infernal regions, namely: A'mru B. A'bdud, and Naofel B. A'bdullah Makhz\u00fbmy, and O'thm\u00e2n B. Moniah of the Bani A'bdu-d-d\u00e2r, who was struck by an arrow in this Ghazwah, and on his arrival in Mekkah he surrendered his life to the possessor of hell on account of that wound.\n\nThe Ghazwah of the Bani Qoryttah.\n\nWhen the breeze of Divine favour which wafted only from the spirit of Allah commenced to blow, and the morn of prosperity began to dawn in the orient of hope, the adherents of rebellion and sin, whose head and chief was Abu Sofy\u00e2n, returned overthrown and disappointed, as was narrated above. His holy lordship returned with his companions to Madinah, and according to the tradition of Ebn A'bb\u00e2s\u2014u. w. b.\u2014his lordship entered the house of [his daughter] Fattimah Zohra, the princess of the women of this world\u2014u. w. b.\u2014washed his august head and body from dust and dirt, and engaged in his matutinal prayers. After he had completed these, Jebr\u00e2il the faithful, having a white turban on his head, and riding on a mule, arrived, his countenance being full of dust. His lordship then rose, cleansed his face therefrom, and Jebr\u00e2il said: 'O Muhammad, may Allah the Most High pardon thee for having put away thy arms, whereas the angels have not yet done so!' According to another tradition he said: 'O apostle of Allah, puttest thou away thy arms?' He replied: 'Yes.' Jebr\u00e2il continued: 'May God the Most Magnificent and Glorious pardon thee, because the angels have not put away their arms forty days and nights.' Then he said: 'O Muhammad, arise to strike the idolaters who are possessors of the book, namely, the Bani Qoryttah [Jews]. By Allah! I am going to batter their fort and to break it to pieces like the egg of a hen struck against a stone.' Accordingly, the apostle ordered Ball\u00e2l to proclaim\n\n320 Only five names, unless the conjunction 'and' be inserted between the two last.\nin Madinah that no obedient man should recite that day's afternoon prayers, except among the Bani Qoryttah. Then he called for A'li, gave him the banner, sent him with a crowd of Moh\u00e2jer to the vanguard, and despatched the companions in separate detachments after him. A number of the A'bdu-l-ashhal and of the Bani An-najj\u00e2r also marched with the army. Some of the companions imagined that the prohibition of his lordship the receptacle of termination from afternoon prayers had been superfluous, and accordingly, when the time for the second prayers had arrived, they held them on the road, whilst others who had taken the command in the strict sense held them among the Bani Qoryttah. Neither of these two parties were either blamed or approved.\n\nAfter A'li had departed, his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014put on his cuirass and his helmet, took his shield on his back and his spear into his hand. According to a certain tradition, he mounted his own donkey called Yaghf\u00fbr; but, according to another, he rode his horse called Najyf, ordering two more to be kept ready. All the companions had prepared themselves for war and accompanied his lordship, Ssiddyq riding on his right and F\u00e2r\u00fbq on his left, the principal Moh\u00e2jer and noble Anss\u00e2r preceding him. Kh\u00e2led, the brother of Ball\u00e2l, also took a spear in his hand, and walked in front of that prince's charger [erect] like a spear. His lordship prayed and recited the Qur\u00e2n. The whole army of Isl\u00e2m amounted to three thousand men, who had thirty-six horses. While the army was marching, the tribe Bani An-najj\u00e2r made its appearance, fully armed and drawn up in battle array, and when his lordship asked them: 'Who has ordered you to arm yourselves?' they replied: 'Wohyah Kalby, riding a mule covered with satin, worked in with precious stones, had come to us, saying: \"Arm yourselves, because this moment the apostle of God will come in sight.\" ' His lordship said: 'That was Jebr\u00e2\u00eel, who was going to pro-\n\n321 It may be observed that in every campaign the number of horses was very small.\nduce an earthquake in the fort of the Bani Qoryttah.' Then the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014marched with his companions, and all reached their destinations between evening and bedtime.\n\nThere is a tradition of A'li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014that he said: 'When we arrived near the fort of the Bani Qoryttah, a man who was standing on the top of it perceived me, and exclaimed: \"Verily, the murderer of A'mru has arrived;\" and I heard another saying: \"A'li has killed A'mru, who is resuscitated in hell;\" and I replied: \"Praise be to Allah, who has manifested Isl\u00e2m and extirpated idolatry.\"' It is related that when A'li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014arrived at the foot of the stronghold of the Bani Qoryttah he erected the standard on the ground, whilst the Jews on the top of the fort derided and reviled his lordship the best of men. A'li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014then left Qot\u00e2dah in charge of the banner, went to meet the Mussttafa\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and spoke to him as follows: 'O apostle of God, do not go near the fort of the Jews, because God the Most High will soon put them to shame.' His lordship rejoined: 'I fancy thou hast heard them say something that might displease me.' A'li replied in the affirmative, and his lordship continued: 'When they see me they will not utter those words.' And, approaching the fort, the apostle of God said: 'O ye brothers of monkeys and of swine, we have arrived, and the morn of those who accept the warning has dawned.' According to another tradition, he said: 'Move off, for God will move you off.' The Jews replied: 'O father of Q\u00e2sim, thou hast been neither a fool nor a reviler; what has happened that thou art such this day?' When his lordship heard these words he retired on account of the great shame he felt, and they are said to have made such an impression upon him that he dropped the lance he was holding in his blessed hand, and the Red\u00e2 fell to the ground from his blessed back. Asyd B. Khadzyr exclaimed: 'O enemies of God, we shall not leave the gate of this fort until we have starved you to death; and now you resemble those foxes\nwho cannot be expelled from their hole.' The Jews replied: 'O Khadzyr, we are thy friends, and not of the Khazraj; nor did we expect such treatment at thy hands.' Asyd replied: 'Between you and me there is neither treaty nor love, and Isl\u00e2m has severed all treaties.' After that his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014ordered Sa'd B. Abu Wogq\u00e2ss to shoot arrows at them, and Sa'd says: 'On that day I was shooting arrows till the evening, and was so engaged also during one hour of the night. The apostle remained quietly sitting in a house, and around him were also those, drawn up in battle array, who possessed horses. When his holy and prophetic lordship gave me permission to depart, I returned to the camp. At that time our food consisted of dates which Sa'd B. A'b\u00e2dah had loaded on his own camels and sent. As we were eating them the apostle of God exclaimed: \"Dates are good food!\"'\n\nAfter fifteen or, according to other traditions, twenty-five days and nights had elapsed since the beginning of the war and siege, God the Most High and Magnificent inspired the hearts of the Jews with terror, so that they ceased fighting and sent Ny\u00e2sh B. Qays to the apostle of God with the following message: 'We have decided to emigrate like the Bani An-natzyr. Therefore do not shed our blood, that we may take our families and children with whatever our camels are able to bear, except arms, and may depart from this country.' His lordship was unwilling to agree, whereon they sent another message of the following purport: 'We shall abandon our goods and chattels. Only allow us to take our wives and children by their hands and go to another place.' This demand was likewise abortive, and his lordship said: 'You must surrender unconditionally.' Ny\u00e2sh then returned with this answer to his people. The Jews were much dismayed and confused; therefore Ka'b B. Asyd, who was their chief, assembled the most prominent men of the Bani Qoryttah. In that assembly, also, Hay B. Akhtt\u00e2b, who had entered the fort on account of the treaty he had made with Ka'b, was present. Ka'b\nspoke as follows: 'O ye Jews, I swear by God ye all know that Muhammad is His prophet, but from envy you have till this day made neither a profession of the Faith nor a promise to obey Muhammad. Now I propose three things to you, with one of which you must comply.' They asked: 'What are they?' He said: 'First, all of you who have studied the Toratah must, in consequence of your knowledge, profess the Faith and take hold of the skirts of obedience to Muhammad, that your property, lives and baggage may remain safe and protected from the vicissitudes of these times.' The Jews said: 'We cannot apostatize from our religion, and prefer another book to the Toratah.' Ka'b continued: 'If this appears difficult to you, then let us kill our wives and children with our own hands, sally out and fight, so that if we are conquered they will not suffer misery and humiliation after us; but if we are successful we shall not be at a loss to find other wives and children.' The Bani Qoryttah, however, rejoined: 'What excuse can there be for murdering those innocent and unfortunate beings, and who will have the heart to kill them? Indeed, what pleasure can we have after their loss, and what enjoyment of life without their company?' He continued: 'If you do not agree to my proposal, then let us attack Muhammad and his companions in the night, because this is the eve of the Sabbath and they are off their guard.' The Bani Qoryttah replied: 'How can we violate the sanctity of the Sabbath, considering that ere this a company of the children of Esr\u00e2yl have done so and have been annihilated by God the Most High and Glorious?'\n\nIn some biographical works it is recorded that Ebn Asyd said to the people: 'To-morrow is the Sabbath day, and the professors of Isl\u00e2m are at ease concerning us. It will therefore be proper suddenly to attack them and to overwhelm them.' The Bani Qoryttah rejoined: 'How can we break the Sabbath?' And repeating their former excuse, they refused to comply. After the Jews had fallen into this distress, they requested his lordship to permit Abu-l-b\u00e2bah,\nwho was their friend and confederate, to speak to them concerning their affairs. Permission having been given, Abu-l-b\u0101bah entered the fort, and was met by the Jews, whose wives and children assembled around them, lamenting so piteously that he had compassion for them. The nobles of the Bani Qoryttah asked him: 'Thinkest thou that we ought to surrender unconditionally to Muhammad or not?' Abu-l-b\u0101bah said 'Yes,' but at the same time made a signal to his own people, which meant: 'There is no other way but to kill.' Abu-l-b\u0101bah says: 'That very moment I repented, and desired to revoke what I had done, whereon Ka'b asked me: \"What is the matter with thee?\" I replied: \"I swear by God and the apostle that I have committed a treachery.\" Then I came down from the fort, and was so overpowered by my feelings that my moustache was wet from my tears, and shame impeded me to meet either the apostle or my friends, so I departed to Madinah and entered the mosque opposite to Omm Solmah's house. I entered, and, tying myself to the threshold, said: \"Let no one take notice of me except during the times of prayer, that my repentance may become acceptable to the Lord of Glory.\" It is said that he remained thus tied up for several days and nights, but his daughter came [occasionally] and placed dates in his mouth. When the apostle of Allah became aware of his case, he said: 'Had he first come to me, I would have pleaded for his pardon, but now I shall not liberate him until God accepts his repentance.' According to a tradition, a revelation descended after fifteen days concerning the penance of Abu-l-b\u0101bah.\n\nWhen the Bani Qoryttah were enfeebled and distressed they came down [from their fort] in obedience to the command of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014who ordered Muhammad B. Moslamah to fetter the hands of the men, and A'bdullah B. Sull\u0101m to take possession of their women, children, arms, goods and chattels. In that fort four thousand sheep, five hundred swords, five hundred cuirasses, three hundred shields, with a great quantity of household furniture and vessels, were found, as well as\ninnumerable camels, oxen, and other cattle. On that occasion the nobles and chiefs of the Awus hastened to wait upon the lord of this world, and said: 'O apostle of God, thou hast shown mercy and kindness to the Bani Qaynuqaa' who were friends of A\u2019bdullah B. Abu Sal\u00fbl, and hast spared the lives of seven hundred men, four hundred of whom wore cuirasses. Vouchsafe now to show mercy to the Bani Qoryttah, who are our friends, and have repented of having broken their covenant, and to forgive their transgressions and crimes.' His lordship, however, made no reply to the Bani Awus, till their solicitations had exceeded all bounds, when he asked: 'Will you agree that one of yourselves make a decision concerning them?' They said: 'Yes, O apostle of God.' He continued: 'That man will be Sa\u2019d B. Moa\u2019adh. We shall do whatever he decides in this matter.' Then the apostle of God sent a person to Madinah to bring Sa\u2019d, his presence at the Ghazwah having been prevented by a wound. Some persons mounted him on a donkey and started with him to wait upon his lordship, but before they had reached the noble assembly of the prophetic lord, a number of the Bani Awus said to him: 'O father of A\u2019mru, the apostle of God has left to thy option the judgment concerning the Bani Qoryttah. They are thy friends, who have aided thee in peace and in war. They have surrendered everything, and their only hope centres in thee. Thou hast seen what laudable efforts Ebn Abu Sal\u00fbl had made in favour of his confederates the Bani Qaynuqaa'. Now we request thee to employ similar efforts of mercy and compassion for saving the lives of the Bani Qoryttah.' Though the Bani Awus had long spoken in this strain, Sa\u2019d make no reply, but at last, when their importunities had become very pressing, he said: 'This is not the time for reproaching Sa\u2019d with having been remiss in matters concerning God the Most High and Glorious.' Dzoh\u00e2k B. Khalifah, who had heard these words, and also Moa\u2019tab B. Qashyr exclaimed: 'Woe to my friends!' And A\u2019attub B. Ommyah lamented: 'No trace of my people will remain at the end of this day.'\nWhen Sa\u2019d B. Moa\u2019adh reached the august assembly of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014the latter turned to those who were present, and said: \u2018Rise to your chief!\u2019 Then a number of the Bani A\u2019bdul-ashhal who were of the tribe of Sa\u2019d rose and took him down from the animal he was riding. When he had taken a seat, a portion of the Bani Awus who had no right to speak in the assembly of his lordship [nevertheless] said: \u2018O father of A\u2019mru, the prophet of Allah has given into thy hands the bridle of judgment concerning the Bani Qoryttah. Remember the past obligations which they have conferred upon thee, so as to deal leniently and mercifully with them.\u2019 Sa\u2019d replied to the Bani Awus: \u2018Do you make an agreement and promise before the Lord Most High that you will assent to my decision, and will not transgress it?\u2019 All answered affirmatively. Then he turned towards his lordship the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014but refrained from an excess of self-importance and complacency to address him [in particular], and said: \u2018Everyone here will assent to my judgment.\u2019 Whereon the apostle of God said: \u2018The judgment will be as thou decidest.\u2019 Sa\u2019d continued: \u2018My decision is that all their men be killed, and the yoke of servitude be placed upon the necks of their wives and children, and that their property be distributed among the Musalmans.\u2019 The apostle of God then exclaimed: \u2018Sa\u2019d, thou hast judged them as God the Most High and Glorious has judged them from the height of the seven heavens.\u2019 After that his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014ordered the hands of the Bani Qoryttah to be tied to their backs, and they were taken thus to Madinah, to be imprisoned in the Serai As\u00e2matah. Their wives and children were confined in the house of Zamlah, the daughter of H\u00e2reth, who was a woman of the Bani An-najj\u00e4r. Several donkey-loads of dates were given to the prisoners; but as the hands of the Jews had been tied by the strong cords of the law, they fell upon their faces, picked the dates up with their mouths, and thus consumed them. During the night preceding the day of their removal to non-existence\nthey were till morning engaged in reciting the Toratah, admonishing each other to patience and constancy. The apostle of God ordered a trench to be dug in a suitable place, and as they were brought out in squads from the house of As\u00e1matah, A'li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and Zobeyr set about striking off their heads, by order of his lordship the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014so that the blood of those unfortunate wretches flowed into the trench. It is related that when those people were being led to the place of execution they asked Ka'b B. Asyd: 'Knowest thou where we are being taken to?' He replied: 'You argue in every place! Do you not perceive that no company taken away has returned? By Allah! no other thing but slaughter awaits you, nor have I called you for any other business.' They would, however, not believe, and continued: 'Ka'b, this is not the time for reviling and reproaching us.' When Hay B. Akhttab was brought with tied hands to his lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014the latter exclaimed: 'O enemy of God, at last the Most High and Glorious has given thee into my power, and has made me thy judge.' He replied: 'I do not blame myself for having borne emnity to thee. I desired to exalt myself, but God the Most High has given thee the victory, and there is no remedy. Calamities like this have often befallen the children of Esr\u00e1yl.' At that time the lion of attack\u2014u. w. b.\u2014unsheathed the Dhu-l-fiq\u00e1r for the purpose of slaying him, whereon Hay said: 'The death of a noble by the hand of a noble!' But A'li replied: 'The wicked slay the good, and the latter the former; but woe betide those by whose hands the good fall, and happy is he whom the wicked kill.' Hay said: 'What thou hast spoken is true. I beseech thee not to take off my robe from my body.' A'li rejoined: 'That is easier to me than to kill thee.' Then Hay stretched out his neck, and the Amir of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014despatched him with his scimitar. After that Ka'b B. Asyd was brought with his hands tied on his neck to the lord of apostleship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014who said: 'Ka'b, why have you not profited by the advice of the youth who ordered and recommended yo.\nto follow me, saying: \"When you see Muhammad, convey to him my salutation\"? Ka'b replied: 'O father of Q\u00e0sim, I swear by the truth of the Toratah that, had the Jews not been obstinate and headstrong to assert that Ka'b professes the Faith for fear of death and the sword, I would have believed and followed thee; but I remained in the Jewish religion from shame.' Accordingly, at a signal from his lordship, he was also caused to join his friends [in death]. On that day A\u2019li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and Zobeyr were till the evening engaged in slaying the Bani Qoryttah, and when the night set in the lamp of life of those who yet remained [to be executed] was extinguished by torchlight. It is said that on this occasion the women of the Bani Qoryttah were hoping his holy and prophetic lordship would accept either ransom or tribute, and would spare the lives of their men; when, however, they were executed all the females tore their garments, cut off their hair, walked with bare heads, wept bloody tears, their lamentations and shouts ascending to the sky, and Zobeyr B. M\u00e2tty\u00e0, of the Bani Qoryttah, who was an aged and experienced man, and had seen the reverses of fortune in this world, endeavoured to comfort them with the refreshing showers of friendly advice. It is related that Th\u00e0bet B. Qays B. Shamm\u00e0s the Anss\u00e0ri had been captured on the day of the battle, and that Zobeyr B. M\u00e2tty\u00e0 had freed him from the disgrace of bondage, and had treated him kindly. In the war of the Bani Qoryttah, Th\u00e0bet met Zobeyr, and asked: 'Knowest thou me?' Zobeyr replied: 'How could one like me not recognise one like thee?' Th\u00e0bet continued: 'Now I desire to requite thy kindness.' Zobeyr replied: 'He is indeed noble who returns mercy for past favours.' Then Th\u00e0bet went to the apostle of God, and said: 'I am under great obligations to Zobeyr, and now I wish to show him my gratitude. If therefore the august mind of your prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014deems fit, you will give Zobeyr to me.' His lordship answered: 'I give him to thee.' But when Th\u00e0bet informed Zobeyr of this [gift],\nthe latter said: 'What enjoyment can an old man have in this life when he is separated from his wife and child?' Then Th\u00e2bet again waited upon the prince of existences\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and besought him to release the family and children of Zobeyr from the bonds of servitude. This request was also granted, and when the little old Jew was informed thereof, he said: 'If my family have no property how can they live, and what pleasure can I derive from them?' Th\u00e2bet again obtained the honour of admittance into the noble assembly, and pleaded for a gift of property, which his lordship also granted. When Th\u00e2bet conveyed this news to Zobeyr, the latter asked: 'What has become of him whose countenance was pure like a Chinese mirror, the aspect whereof demented the moon-faced and sun-like virgins of the tribes, namely, of Ka'b B. Asyd?' Th\u00e2bet replied: 'He has been killed.' Zobeyr continued: 'Where has the grandee of the town and of the country gone to, who invited the people to war, who fed them when they were hungry, and felt pity for the destitute and the poor, namely, Hay B. Akhttab?' Th\u00e2bet replied: 'He also has been slain.' Zobeyr further asked: 'How is that intelligent and acute individual, who dispersed every assembly he liked, and solved every difficulty he was bent upon, namely, Nab\u00e2sh B. Qays?' He replied: 'That man has likewise departed into non-existence.' In this manner he inquired about every one of the chiefs, the nobles, the U'l\u00e2ma, and good men among the Bani Qoryttah, but being informed that all of them had been executed, he said: 'O Th\u00e2bet, I swear by God that it is worse to be separated from one's friends than to be dead. Therefore I adjure thee by the old obligations thou art under to me to cause also me to join my intimate friends by means of the sword.' Th\u00e2bet now became angry, and complied with his request. Some, however, relate that Th\u00e2bet surrendered Zobeyr to Zobeyr B. Ala'ww\u00e2m, who struck off his head.\n\nIt is related that the number of the slain of the Bani\n\n322 Supra Ny\u00e2sh, having, in lieu of one, two dots under the second letter.\nQoryttah amounted to seven hundred men, but it has also been estimated higher and lower than this. When the apostle of Allah had terminated the execution of the Bani Qoryttah, the wound of Sa\u2019d B. Moa\u2019adh\u2014u. w. b.\u2014again opened, and when he was in his last agony his lordship was present at his bedside, and, placing his head on his own blessed knees, said: \u2018O God, Sa\u2019d has suffered in Thy cause, has believed Thy prophet, and has fulfilled every duty imposed upon him by Isl\u00e2m. Take, therefore, his spirit in the best way, as Thou takest the spirits of Thy friends!\u2019 Sa\u2019d, hearing the voice of his prophetic lordship, opened his eyes, and said: \u2018Salutation to thee, O apostle of God! I testify that thou art an apostle of Allah, and that thou hast promulged His message as it was proper.\u2019 Then he raised his head from the knee of the apostle of God, who returned to his house, and one hour afterwards Sa\u2019d was received into the mercy of God. Jebr\u00e2\u00eel then descended with his turban of lightning on his head, and asked: \u2018O Muhammad, who of thy companions has died, for whom the portals of heaven were opened, and at whose death the throne of the Merciful has quaked?\u2019 His lordship the apostle said: \u2018I was just now with Sa\u2019d, but I have left him in the agony of death.\u2019 After that his lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014the refuge of termination, again condescended to pay a visit to Sa\u2019d, and ordered his corpse to be washed. Then his bier was taken up by some companions and borne to the Baqyi\u2019 [cemetery]; and when those friends said to the prophet: \u2018Sa\u2019d was a tall man and had a large body; we nevertheless found his bier to be extremely light,\u2019 his lordship replied: \u2018I have seen angels taking up the bier of Sa\u2019d\u2014u. w. b.\u2019\n\nThe Crime of Abu Sofy\u00e2n, and the Going of the Ignorant Behr\u00e2n to Madinah with the Intention to Kill the Prophet of the Latter Days\u2014upon Him and His Family be the Blessing of Allah!\n\nHistorians and chroniclers narrate that, after Abu Sofy\u00e2n had returned from the war of the ditch, he said to a number\nof men: 'Is there anyone among you who will go to Madinah, will find an opportunity, and will avenge us upon Muhammad, who is walking about alone in the bazars, and is so intent on promulgating his apostolate that he cares neither for friend nor foe.' These words having been overheard by an Arab [of the desert], he betook himself to the house of Abu Sofy\u00e2n, and privately said to him: 'If thou wilt support me, I shall do the business of Muhammad. I am well acquainted with the roads, have an excellent sharp dirk, and fear no one.' Abu Sofy\u00e2n was glad, approved of his intention, provided him with food and with a camel, saying: 'Thou art not to divulge this secret to anyone.' The Arab replied: 'Be secure on that score; for no one except myself and thee shall know anything on this subject.' The Arab accordingly started one night from Mekkah, and, after traversing the distance, arrived in a short time in Madinah, where he made inquiries about his lordship the apostle, and, being told that he was in the tribe Bani A'bdu-l-ashhal, he immediately tied up his camel and started on foot in search of the apostle of God. At the time the said Arab had reached his place of destination, his lordship the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014happened to be sitting with a number of his companions, engaged in conversation, at the gate of the mosque. When his blessed vision alighted on the envoy of Abu Sofyan, he said: 'This individual meditates treachery; but Divine grace intervenes between him and me.' When that fellow came nearer, he asked: 'Who among you is the son of A'bd-ul-Muttalleb?' His lordship replied: 'I am the son of A'bd-ul-Muttalleb.' The Arab then immediately approached the apostle of God like a man intent to speak to some one; but Asyd B. Khadzyr pulled him up, saying: 'Be off from the apostle of God, thou accursed fellow!' And, laying his hand upon the Arab's girdle, he felt a dirk under the robe. He accordingly exclaimed: 'O apostle of God, this is a traitor!' The Arab thereon, falling at the feet of Asyd, said: 'Grant me my life.' The latter, however, held him fast, and his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014turning to the Arab,\nsaid: 'Tell the truth. Who art thou, and what business hast thou come for? Thy veracity will be of advantage to thee if thou speakest the truth, but in the contrary case God the Most High Himself will inform me of thy intentions.' The Arab asked for quarter, and on receiving it stated his case; whereon he was, at a signal of his holy and prophetic lordship, imprisoned by Asyd. The next day the apostle of God called for the Arab, and said to him: 'I give thee liberty to depart whenever thou listest; for, verily, thou canst do a better thing than this [attempt at my life].' The Arab asked: 'What thing is it?' The lord of existences replied: 'It is to bear witness to the unity of God, and to believe in my apostolate.' The Arab then exclaimed: 'I testify that there is no God but Allah, and I testify that thou art the apostle of Allah. I never feared anyone, and dreaded not sharp scimitars; but when I beheld thee my intellect failed me, and my soul was overpowered by weakness. Thou hast guessed my intention, whereas no one except myself and Abu Sofy\u00e1n had knowledge of the secret. I knew not that the Bountiful Sovereign is inspiring and guarding thee; but the amity of Abu Sofy\u00e1n is the amity of Satan.' After the Arab had uttered these words, his lordship smiled; the former tarried a few days, and then asked leave to depart. His request having been complied with, he left Madinah. As, however, Abu Sofy\u00e1n's criminal attempt had been renewed, his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u.w.b.\u2014commanded A'mru B. Ommyah Dhomairi and Soll\u00e1m B. Moslamah to go to Mekkah to watch their opportunity, and to assassinate Abu Sofy\u00e1n B. Harb. Accordingly they started for the sanctuary [of Mekkah], and reached their destination after duly traversing the distance. Whilst, however, they happened to be circumambulating the house of the Ka'bah, an idolater recognised them, and shouted: 'O inhabitants of Mekkah, here is A'mru B. Ommyah! Be on your guard against him!' A'mru says: 'When the people of Mekkah saw us, we departed. Ebn Moslamah mounted his camel and fled towards Madinah, whilst I hastened to the mountains. On\nthat occasion O'thm\u00e2n B. M\u00e1lek encountered me, but I struck his breast with my poniard, and he shouted so loudly that all the people of Mekkah heard his voice. The attention of the inhabitants being concentrated upon him, they ceased to search for me, and I made use of the opportunity to hide myself in a cave, and then in another, where I saw a one-eyed man, who had led his sheep from the meridian sun into the shade. As he was reclining I heard him utter the words: \"I shall not become a Moslem as long as I live; nor is the religion of the Musalm\u00e1ns a good religion.\" He also spoke insulting words concerning the apostle; but I waited till he had fallen asleep, and then pressed one extremity of my bow on his sound eye, and I pressed it so strongly that it entered his brains. When I left the cave I met two Qoraish spies, one of whom I shot with an arrow so that he went to hell, and the other ran away. Both of us arrived safely, and we were honoured by being allowed to kiss the feet of the apostle of God.' When Abu Sofy\u00e1n became aware of what had taken place, he took great precautions to preserve his life.\n\nSARIAH OF ABU O'BAYDAH JURR\u00c1H.\n\nIn the month of Dhu-l-hejjah, in the fifth year after the Flight, his holy and prophetic lordship despatched Abu O'baydah Jurr\u00e1h toward Sayfu-l-hajar, and in that expedition the provisions of the army consisted of dates. It is related that in the beginning each combatant was satisfied with one date per diem, but that at last the ration was reduced to half a date. When, however, they became much distressed, God the most high and glorious threw a fish from the sea upon the shore, the meat whereof nourished three hundred men during one month. In the Mostaqadza there is a tradition of J\u00e1ber\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014which is as follows: 'I passed with my camel under one of the ribs of the fish.'\n\nWaqidi says: 'When the provisions had been consumed in that expedition, Qays B. Sa'd B. A'b\u00e1dah asked: \"Will anyone sell camels for dates on condition of obtaining them\nimmediately, and to be repaid [again for the camels] in dates at Madinah?\" O'mar B. Alkhatt\u00e2b replied: \"It is strange that this youth should stretch forth his hand against the property of his father, he possessing none himself.\" But Qays replied insultingly to F\u00e2r\u00e2q [i.e., to O'mar]: \"My father causes pedestrians to ride, and fills the hungry. How could he refuse to pay a debt which I contract in the cause of those who are combating for the religion?\" Thereon Qays purchased from a man for five camels two loads of dates, which were consumed as needed. When they returned from their expedition, and arrived in Madinah, Sa'd B. A'b\u00e2dah rejoiced at the good act of Qays, praised him and presented him with four date-groves. When the purchaser of the camels arrived in Madinah Sa'd paid him the price of the camels, and kept the matter secret; but when his lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014was apprised of the humanity of Qays, he said: \"Verily he is of a liberal family.\"\n\nMuhammad B. Moslamah Fights the Bani Kall\u00fbb.\n\nIn this year his holy and prophetic lordship sent Muhammad B. Moslamah to the Bani Kall\u00e2b, saying: 'Possibly thou wilt vanquish Tham\u00e2mah B. Ath\u00e2l Annakha'y.' It is recorded in the Mostaqadza that when the apostle of God sent, in the sixth year after the Flight, a detachment of his companions to Najd, they captured a man of the Bani Hanyfah, called Tham\u00e2mah, whom they brought to the lord of the apostolate, by whose orders he was tied to a column of the mosque. When the prophet left his house and entered that mosque, he asked: 'What is the news of Tham\u00e2mah?' He replied: 'I have good news, O Muhammad. If thou killest me, thou killest a professor [of thy religion], and if thou sparest me thou sparest a grateful man. If thou wantest property, ask for it.' The next day the apostle repeated his question, and received the same answer, as well as the third time. Then the apostle of God issued orders to liberate Tham\u00e2mah, whereon the latter immediately departed from the mosque,\nwashed himself, again returned to the mosque, and said: 'I testify that there is no God but Allah, and I testify that thou art the apostle of Allah. O Muhammad, ere this I hated no religion more than thine, and no town more than thine; but at present I love nothing more than both these. O apostle of God, I went to Mekkah to perform the ceremonies of the pilgrimage, and thy people captured me. What are now thy commands?' His lordship congratulated Tham\u00e2mah, and told him to go on pilgrimage to Mekkah. It is said that when Tham\u00e2mah made his appearance in the sanctuary a man said to him: 'Thou hast become a Sab\u00e6an;' but he replied: 'I have entered the religion of Isl\u00e2m, and have selected the way of truth, and I swear by God that you will not receive a single grain of wheat from Tham\u00e2mah, except by the command of Muhammad, the apostle of God\u2014u. w. b.' When Tham\u00e2mah arrived in his country he told the people not to carry grain any longer to Mekkah, and the Qoraish being distressed thereby, sent a letter to Madinah, requesting his lordship to order Tham\u00e2mah to deal with them as formerly. According to the exuberance of benevolence and kind-heartedness peculiar to his lordship, he complied, and the inhabitants of the sanctuary escaped from famine. It is related that in this journey Muhammad B. Moslamah fought a battle with the Bani Kall\u00e1b, in which the infidels lost two men and the rest of them fled, but one hundred and fifty camels with three thousand sheep of the idolaters fell to the share of the professors of Isl\u00e2m. Muhammad B. Moslamah says: 'Ten nights of the month Moharram had elapsed when we marched out, and one night of the same month was yet remaining when we arrived in Madinah. Our whole number amounted to thirty men; we travelled during the night, and remained concealed during the day.'\n\n**GHAZWAH OF THE BANI TTAY\u00c2N.**\n\nNarrators of histories have recorded that when the calamity of A'assum B. Th\u00e2bet and Habyb B. A'dy, with\ntheir companions, took place, as has been related above, his lordship the apostle became grieved and oppressed in spirit, and was waiting for an opportunity to wreak vengeance on the Bani Ttay\u00e2n, who had committed such treachery. Therefore he proceeded in the sixth year after the Flight with two hundred Moh\u00e2jer and Anss\u00e2r cavaliers towards them, and reached during the march a place where Musalm\u00e2ns had been made prisoners and slain. In that locality his lordship addressed propitiatory devotions to the Courts of Unity for A\u2019assum B. Th\u00e2bet and his companions. Meanwhile the Bani Ttay\u00e2n, having become aware of the approach of the apostle of God, fled to the summits of the mountains, where they fortified themselves, and thus saved their lives from destruction. The prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014halted one day in the above-mentioned locality, and sent out forays into the surrounding region. When he arrived in a place called Ghasf\u00e2n he despatched, according to one tradition, Abu Bakr, and according to another Sa\u2019d B. A\u2019b\u00e2dah, with a detachment towards the enemy. When the Qoraish heard that the army of Isl\u00e2m was coming they fled, so that on the arrival of the said detachment at A\u2019mym no enemy could be found; accordingly, it returned from that place, and again joined the apostle of God.\n\nBorydah says: \u2018In that Ghazwah I attended on his lordship, who looked on his arrival at Ghasf\u00e2n to the right and to the left, and having found his mother\u2019s tomb he performed his religious ablution and went to the grave, on which he engaged in devotions with two prayer-flexions and wept, whereon all of us wept likewise.\u2019 He then rose, and again made two flexions with prayers; he wept and we also. When he returned from the tomb he looked at his companions, and asked them: \u201cWhat was the reason for your crying?\u201d They replied: \u201cWe did as thou didst.\u201d He continued: \u201cWhat did you think?\u201d They said: \u201cWe thought that our people would suffer an unbearable calamity.\u201d He replied: \u201cSuch is not the case; but when I reached the grave of my mother I recited orisons with two prayer-flexions, and requested the Lord of Unity to be\nallowed to ask pardon for her; but I was reproved, and therefore I wept. Accordingly, I again prayed with two flexions, and asked permission to intercede for her, but was reproved again.\"\n\nIn the *Seir K\u00e1zr\u00e1n\u00ed* it is related that, when the apostle of God had terminated his conversation, he asked for his camel, mounted it, and after that the blessed verse, 'It is not [allowed] unto the prophet, nor those who are true believers, that they pray for idolaters,' etc., was revealed. Then the lord of apostles said to his companions: 'Be ye witnesses that I am innocent of this, in the same way as Ebr\u00e2him was innocent of [the sin of having prayed for] his father.'\n\nIt is related that during this year his holy and prophetic lordship sent O'mar B. Alkhatt\u00e2b to the Bani Qor\u00e2rah, who stood fast while O'mar shot arrows at them with the right and the left hand. Ball\u00e2l B. Alh\u00e2reth Almazany was sent to the tribe M\u00e2lek B. [name omitted], but they all fled, so that the Musalm\u00e2ns found nothing in their place except one horse. On that occasion also Bashyr B. Sowyd Ajjahanny was sent against the H\u00e2rethhah Kun\u00e2nah, but the idolaters, being on their guard, fled into a thicket, which, however, Bashyr set on fire and burnt them all. When his lordship heard of this, he said: 'You have done an evil deed.'\n\n**A'LI THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL\u2014U. W. B.\u2014GOES TO THE BANI SA'D.**\n\nA'li the son of Abu Taleb\u2014u. w. b.\u2014was despatched with one hundred men to the tribe Bani Sa'd, which was in the region of Fadak, because his august lordship the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had heard that the said tribe was engaged in collecting an army, and desired to aid the Jews of Khayber to march together against Madinah. Accordingly, that whale of the ocean of contest [i.e., A'li] marched during the night, and concealed himself during\n\n---\n\n323 She, having died an idolater, could not be prayed for, and therefore Muhammad was reproved.\n\n324 Qur\u00e2n, ch. ix. 114.\nthe day, until he arrived on that route in a place called Haj\u00fan, where that Commander of the Faithful happened to meet one of the idolaters, and interrogated him concerning the opponents. That man replied: 'I shall guide you to them on condition that you grant me quarter.' His request having been complied with, he fulfilled his promise and led the Musalm\u00e1ns to the Bani Sa\u2019d, who, however, fled, but five hundred camels with two thousand sheep fell into the hands of the Musalm\u00e1ns. A\u2019li B. Abu T\u00e2leb\u2014u. w. b.\u2014then selected a few good camels for the special use of his lordship. He also separated one-fifth [of the spoils], distributing the rest among them, and returned victoriously, arriving sound and safe in Madinah.\n\nGHAZWAH OF THE BANI QURDAH, WHICH IS CALLED GHAZ\u00c1 OF YAMANAH.\n\nThere is a tradition of Solman B. Al-akwa\u2019 that he said: \u2018I was with Rabaa\u2019, the freed man of the apostle of God. We were coming out from Madinah, and I was riding the horse of Abu Ttolhah, the Anss\u00e1ri, when all of a sudden at the break of dawn A\u2019bd\u00fa-r-rahman B. O\u2019tbah B. Hossyn Qor\u00e2y arrived on the pasturage of the milk-camels of his lordship the apostle of God, killed the camel-driver and stole the camels. I gave the horse to Rabaa\u2019 to ride to Madinah in order to inform the apostle of God of this event. Then I mounted a hillock, and shouted thrice: \u201cYa Ssabahah!\u201d I then pursued the idolaters with the sharp sword and the quiver of arrows I had. When I came near them I shot arrows at them, and every arrow I discharged wounded one of them. In that plain there were many trees, and whenever a rider attacked me I crouched down behind one of them, and kept him off by wounding him with an arrow. Sometimes I ascended the mountains and threw stones and shot arrows at them. Matters went on thus between me and the opponents until I had distressed them in such a manner that they were under the necessity of abandoning the camels of the apostle of God, which I drove to Madinah, and then again pursued those men,\nwhom I so harassed with my arrows that they threw away their spears and cloaks to engage my attention, and so hinder me from continuing my attacks. In that emergency a number of infidels came to the rescue of their people and were approaching. I, however, all of a sudden caught sight of Huz\u00e2m Asdy and Abu Qot\u00e2dah and Moqd\u00e2d Aswad Kundy, with other cavaliers who belonged to the vanguard of the apostle of God's army appearing among the trees. When the idolaters beheld the professors of Isl\u00e2m they fled; Huz\u00e2m pursued them; I came down from the mountain, caught the bridle of his horse, and advised him to wait a little till the apostle of Allah arrived with his companions, but Huz\u00e2m replied: \"O Moslamah, if thou believest in his lordship and in the day of the resurrection, thou knowest that paradise and hell are true. Do not interfere between me and martyrdom.\" I accordingly let go my hold, whereon Huz\u00e2m ran to A'bdu-r-rahman B. O'tbah, whom he struck with his lance, but unsuccessfully; then the latter did the same to the former, made him a martyr, and took possession of his horse after alighting from his own. At that time Abu Qot\u00e2dah, the Anss\u00e2ri, reached him, but A'bdu-r-rahman wounded Abu Qot\u00e2dah with his spear, whereon the latter killed the former with one thrust of his lance and wounded his horse. After A'bdu-r-rahman had been slain we pursued the enemy, who entered a pass containing a spring of water, called Dhu Qarwah. The idolaters first turned to the water to drink, but when they saw us approaching they passed it by in haste and fled, whereon I alone pursued that company till sunset, and having taken from them two other horses I returned. When I arrived in Dhu Qarwah I saw that the apostle of God had halted in that place with the army of Isl\u00e2m, and that Ball\u00e2l, having slaughtered one of the camels was roasting a Kab\u00e2b.\\(^{325}\\) I said: \"O apostle of God, allow me to go with one hundred picked men in pursuit of the opponents, and not to leave one of them alive.\" That prince replied: \"Wouldst thou do that?\" I con-\n\n\\(^{325}\\) Meat cut in pieces and dressed with onions, eggs, etc.\ntinued: \"I swear by that God who has exalted and honoured thee that I would do that.\" His lordship, however, smiled so that his august teeth [became visible and] shone brightly like fire, and he said: \"O son of Akwa', be parsimonious when thou possessest,\" and, \"An excellent man is lenient and more compassionate;\" or, according to another tradition, the apostle of God said: \"Now they are feasting in the tribe of Ghattaf\u00e2n.\" After that a man of the tribe arrived and said that one of the Bani Ghattaf\u00e2n had retained that company and slaughtered a camel, but when they were skinning it dust rose at a distance, which they took to be the army of Isl\u00e2m, and fled. When it was morning, his holy and prophetic lordship said: \"To-day the best of our riders is Abu Qot\u00e2dah, and the best pedestrian Solmah.\" I accompanied the former until he took me behind him on his camel, and we returned to Madinah.' The author says that if the pen of explanation were to record every Sariah and every event, the account would become very lengthy and greatly enlarge this abridgment; wherefore he has considered it proper to omit some, will do so in future also, and will confine himself to the narratives of the more important events, if it pleaseth God the Most High.\n\nPRAYING FOR RAIN.\n\nIt is related that in the sixth year after the Flight there happened to be a great famine and tremendous dearth in Madinah. The Musalm\u00e2ns accordingly made haste to wait upon the prince of the world, and said: 'O apostle of God, the portals of abundance are closed, and the showers of mercy have ceased, so that great damage has befallen the fruit-trees; the cattle and other quadrupeds are perishing; and the people have fallen from comfort into misery, and from cheerfulness into distress. We beseech thee to ask the Bounteous Giver to refresh and to irrigate with the showers of His favour and goodness the garden of hopes of those who are wandering in the desert of exclusion.' Therefore the apostle of God ordered the people on a\ncertain day to take provisions with them and to accompany him to the desert, for the purpose of praying for rain. On the appointed day his lordship donned old garments and proceeded with all humility and solemnity to the spot, where he performed two flexions with prayers, not using the [customary] formality of calling the people to prayers through the Muedhdhin. During the first prayer-flexion he recited the chapter 'Praise the name of thy Most High Lord,'\\(^{326}\\) and during the second 'Hath the news of the overwhelming day [of judgment] reached thee?'\\(^{327}\\) in a loud voice. When he had terminated his prayers he turned his face towards the companions, and inverted his pure Red\u0101, for a good omen, that famine might be changed to abundance and wealth. He raised his blessed hands and shouted one Takbir, uttering after that his prayer for rain with his wonderfully eloquent tongue. The narrator of this tradition says: 'We were yet in that place when a small cloud appeared on the sky, which unfolded itself, shedding abundant rain in such a manner that it never ceased during seven days and nights, after the expiration of which time the professors of Isl\u0101m said: \"O apostle of God, our goods are spoiled, our houses are falling to pieces, and intercourse between the people has ceased. Lift up thy hands in prayer, that the Lord and Creator cause the rain to cease and the world-illuminating sun to shine.\" His holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014being astonished at the inconsistency of mankind, smiled so as to show his blessed molar teeth, and then, turning his exalted countenance to the Qiblah of prayer, said: \"O God, rain for us, and not upon us. [Rain] on the tops of hills and bottoms of valleys and the roots of plants.\" When his lordship had completed the prayers, the sky immediately cleared up, and Madinah was lit by the rays of the world-illuminating sun, so that in and around the city not one drop more fell.' It is related that when the apostle of God saw that it was [still] raining in the environs of Mekkah he laughed so [heartily] as to display\n\n\\(^{326}\\) Qur\u0101n, ch. lxxxvii. 1.\n\n\\(^{327}\\) Ibid., ch. lxxxviii. 1.\nhis teeth, and said: 'May God the Most High reward Abu T\u00e2leb, for if he were alive he would rejoice at the verses he had composed, and would possibly recite them to us likewise.' A'li B. Abu T\u00e2leb said: 'O apostle of God, perhaps thou wantest these verses?' Then he began to recite the verses of Abu T\u00e2leb, and some biographers state that their interpretation is as follows:\n\n'God has given rain to us thirsty ones\nTo favour the prophet of genii and men;\nBy it our orphans were fed,\nBy it our cattle were watered;\nThe Bani H\u00e2shem are under his protection,\nThey all wish for his exaltation and dignity.\nIn every battle Muhammad was victorious,\nGod aided him with conquest;\nWe shall never abandon him,\nEven if we be killed around him.'\n\nAccording to the statements of all biographers and historians, the circumambulation of the house of the Ka'bah became obligatory during this year, and in confirmation thereof they add that the blessed verse 'Perform the pilgrimage [of Mekkah] and the visitation of Allah' was revealed in the sixth year. The word 'perform' means 'to stay,' and not 'to complete.' Some, however, assert that it was made obligatory in the ninth year; but to discuss the claims [to credence] of these two parties is not suitable in this place.\n\nHis Lordship the Refuge of Termination\u2014U. W. B.\u2014Proceeds to the Noble City of Mekkah with the Intention of Performing the Ceremonies of the Pilgrimage, but is Hindered by the Idolaters, the Treaty of Hodaybiah, and its Events.\n\nThe relater of the tradition says that the apostle of God came out from Madinah and meant to go on pilgrimage, because he had dreamt that he was doing so, holding the key of the Ka'bah in his own blessed hand, whilst some of his companions were shaving their hair, others picking it up and sojourning in A'rafat. When he narrated the\n\n328 Qur\u00e2n, ch. ii. 192.\ndream to his friends they rejoiced, and imagined this great happiness would be realized during the year. In this year Bashyr B. Sofy\u00e2n Alka\u2019by, who had professed the Faith in Mekkah, but had not left the town, was also admitted to the honour of kissing the feet of his lordship. It was arranged that a number of camels should be taken to Mekkah, to be slaughtered there as sacrifices. These amounted to seventy, among which were also the camels of Abu Jahl, that had been taken in the fight at Bedr, and had fallen into the possession of his lordship, N\u00e2hyah B. Jundal being appointed to take care of them. Some of the companions who were opulent slaughtered a camel, such as Abu Bakr, and O\u2019mar, and A\u2019bdu-r-rahman, and Ttolhah. The Musalm\u00e1ns carried no other arms except swords, despite of O\u2019mar B. Alkhatt\u00e1b\u2019s adjuration to the prophet to do so, when he said: \u2018O apostle of God, we must take arms, because we are not secure of Abu Sofy\u00e2n and his companions.\u2019 But his lordship replied: \u2018I do not like to bear arms whilst on the visitation [to the holy places].\u2019 Then Sa\u2019d B. A\u2019b\u00e2dah said: \u2018O apostle of God, it will be better if we take arms, because the people will either offer resistance or not. In the first case we shall need arms, and in the second no harm will befall us.\u2019 His lordship, however, replied: \u2018We shall not take any arms, because we are going on pilgrimage.\u2019 Then he appointed Ebn Makt\u00fam to be his lieutenant in Madinah, and having washed himself at the door of his house, and put on a robe, he mounted the she-camel Qasswy near the gate of his sacred habitation, and turning his blessed face towards the Qiblah he donned the Ehr\u00e1m, and pronounced the words of obedience according to the formula: \u2018I await Thy commands, O Allah! I await Thy commands. Thou hast no partner. Thine is the praise and the glory and the kingdom. Thou hast no partner.\u2019 All the professors of Isl\u00e2m imitated the example, and likewise put on the Ehr\u00e1m on the spot, whereby a portion of them signified their intention of performing the ceremonies connected with the pilgrimage. Concerning the\n\n329 Sacred habit which consists merely of two sheets.\nnumber of the glorious army there is a difference among the U'lama, but according to the most correct traditions of biographers one thousand and four hundred men attended the person of his holy and prophetic lordship. Among the mothers of the Mus\u00e2lmans [i.e., wives of Muhammad] Omm Solmah\u2014u. w. b.\u2014was selected to accompany the apostle of God on that journey. According to the unanimous consensus of biographers, the army departed from Madinah in the beginning of the month Dhu-l-qa'dah, N\u00e2hyah B. Jundal being sent in advance with the led camels, and ordered to constitute with A'b\u00e2dah B. Boshyr and twenty other men the vanguard of the army, and to march through the desert to Mekkah.\n\nIt is related that when the apostle of God arrived in Ghasf\u00e2n, Bashyr B. Sofy\u00e0n, who had been despatched to spy out the Qoraish, returned from Mekkah, and said: 'O apostle of God, the Qoraish have learnt that thou art proceeding to the honoured sanctuary, have put on leather garments, mounted good camels, have started, and, lo! they are halting at Dhu Taul, having made a covenant with each other to hinder thee from entering Mekkah.'\n\nWhen the news of the approach of his lordship spread among the inhabitants of Mekkah, they held a consultation, and determined to hinder that prince from visiting the house of Allah. They accordingly asked aid from the Arab tribes that were dwelling in the environs of the sanctuary, collected a numerous army, marched from Mekkah, halted in the station of Yaldah, and appointed Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd and A'kramah B. Abu Jahl with two hundred troopers to be outposts. When the ray of this information shone upon the illuminated forehead, his lordship held a council of war with the distinguished Mohajer and noble Anss\u00e2r, who said: 'It will be expedient for us to fall upon the women and children of the Arabs who are aiding the Qoraish, and to plunder them, so as to distress them, and to induce them to secede from the Qoraish for the protection of their own families. Then we may easily fight the Qoraish.' Ssiddyq\n[i.e., Abu Bakr], however, said: 'We have this year turned out with the intention of performing the visitation [to the sacred localities] and the pilgrimage to the house of the Ka'bah, without intending to meet or to fight with anyone. When the Qoraish hinder thee to visit the Ka'bah, then we shall fight them.' His lordship approved of the words of Ssiddyq, saying: 'Proceed [on the journey] in the name of Allah the Most High and Glorious.' And, continuing: 'Kh\u00e2led B. Wolyd is in A'mym by way of an outpost. Avoid the beaten track, that we may come upon them unawares.' It is said that the professors of Isl\u00e2m marched in an impracticable and difficult direction, being under the necessity of traversing gorges which greatly harassed the Musalm\u00e2ns. His lordship, however, said: 'This is a path of the paths leading to paradise.' After leaving that locality they reached soft ground, whereon that prince exclaimed: 'Say, I ask pardon from Allah, and repent unto Him!' The narrator of the tradition says: 'I swear by Allah that Kh\u00e2led B. Wolyd was not aware of the approach of the combatants for the religion until he perceived the dust raised by their animals, whereon he fled from fear of the victorious army, and informed the Qoraish of what was taking place.'\n\nWhen his lordship reached a hill which is near Hodaybiah, the she-camel Qasswy, which he rode, knelt down, and, though the companions beat her, she would not get up, so that they said: 'Qasswy is tired.' But the prince of the world rejoined: 'Qasswy is not tired; He who stopped the elephant has stopped her.' The story of the halting of the elephant at the time when Abrahah Ssubb\u00e2h intended to destroy the house of the Ka'bah has been already narrated in these pages in detail. It is related that when the she-camel Qasswy knelt, his lordship exclaimed: 'I swear by God, in whose power the life of Muhammad is, that the Qoraish will ask from me nothing which refers to the glorification of the sanctuary without my complying therewith!' Then he struck the camel till she rose, but deflected\n\n330 Qur\u00e2n, ch. cv., 'The Elephant.'\nfrom the road, and again halted at a well near Hodaybiah, which contained little water. The people complained to his lordship of thirst after having consumed the water in a very short time, whereon he drew an arrow from his quiver and told them to throw it into the well. The narrator of the tradition says that in consequence of this act the water gushed forth so abundantly that one thousand four hundred men, with all their quadrupeds, drank thereof and were satisfied.\n\nJ\u00e2ber B. A\u2019bdullah says that on the day of Hodaybiah the people complained to his lordship the apostle on account of the want of water, and said: \u2018O apostle of God, there is no water at all in this station, except in thy water-bag.\u2019 That prince had a water-bag the contents whereof he used for performing his religious ablutions. When his lordship heard these words, he placed his hands upon the bag, and the water trickled from between his blessed fingers as if it were dripping from a fountain. J\u00e2ber says: \u2018We all drank of that water, and performed our religious ablution.\u2019 Being asked how many persons had drunk of that water and performed their religious ablution, J\u00e2ber replied: \u2018I swear that if we had been one hundred thousand it would have sufficed us!\u2019\n\nWhen the regions and environs of Hodaybiah were honoured by the presence of his holy and prophetic lordship and of his noble companions, Hodhayl B. Warq\u00e2 Khuzaa\u2019y was, with a number of his tribe\u2014who aspired to the amity of his lordship the best of men\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and whose [tribesmen\u2019s] bosoms were the depositories of the orders of the prince of the righteous\u2014admitted to the felicity of kissing the heaven-exalted stirrups of his lordship, and reported that the Bani Ka\u2019b B. Lawy and A\u2019amer B. Lawy had with several Arab tribes taken their position near the wells, with the intention to hinder his lordship from visiting the house of the Ka\u2019bah, and to attack him in case he should refuse to withdraw. The prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014said: \u2018We have not come to fight or to kill anyone, but our intention is to visit the house of Allah and to perform the ceremonies of the\npilgrimage. As the Qoraish are greatly bent on war, they must be displeased with our intention; but if they are willing, we shall appoint a time for the fight. I shall contend against all idolaters. If I am vanquished, they will have gained their object; but if I am the victor, they will have to follow and to obey me like all other people, and thus an end will be made to discord and to war. If, however, the Qoraish refuse to comply with my proposal, I swear by that God in whose power the life of Muhammad is, that I shall fight them, and God the Most High and Magnificent will grant the victory to His adherents, and will execute His purpose.' Hodhayl replied: 'I shall immediately report thy words to the Qoraish.' He then departed from the noble assembly, betook himself to the camp of the idolaters, met the Qoraish, and said: 'I have heard Muhammad's declaration, and if you are so inclined I shall report it.' Then Hukm B. Abu-l-a'ass and all the fools of the people said: 'We do not want to hear his tale.' The intelligent, however, and the discerning exclaimed: 'Tell us what thou hast heard from him.' Accordingly, Hodhayl first narrated what he had listened to, and then spoke as follows: 'O ye Qoraish people, are you desirous of waging war against Muhammad when he is going on pilgrimage to the house of the Ka'bah?' But the infidels thought that Hodhayl had agreed with the Mussttafa\u2014u. w. b.\u2014to deceive them; and with reference to this matter U'rwah B. Masau'd Thaqafi rose and said: 'O ye Qoraish people, are you not in the place of fathers to me, as if I were your son?' They replied: 'Yes, so it is.' U'rwah further asked: 'Do you suspect that I would be inimical or treacherous towards you?' They said: 'No.' Then U'rwah enumerated former obligations under which the Qoraish were bound to him, and said: 'That which Muhammad proposes to you is highly acceptable and praiseworthy. You ought to agree to it, and to allow me to speak with these people.' They replied: 'We have no objection.' U'rwah accordingly waited upon his lordship the prince of existences, and enjoyed the felicity [of speaking to him].\nHis lordship repeated the same words to him which he had said to Hodhayl, and U\u2019rwah spoke thus: \u2018O Muhammad, if thou extirpatest and annihilatest the Qoraish, of what use will it be to thee? Are they not, after all, of thy own nation and of thy blood? I never heard of an Arab acting in this way before. Woe betide thee if thou art conquered! for I see a number of men around thee who will flee and abandon thee on the day of thy calamity, and will leave thee alone.\u2019 When the Ssiddyq heard these words of U\u2019rwah, he began to revile and to insult him, and asked: \u2018Shall we flee from him and leave him alone?\u2019 U\u2019rwah queried: \u2018Who is the speaker of these words?\u2019 The people said: \u2018Abu Bakr.\u2019 U\u2019rwah then continued: \u2018I swear by God, in whose power my life is, that if my pledge to thee had not hindered me, I would have answered and punished thee!\u2019 According to Waqidi, the pledge to Abu Bakr was that during the time of ignorance U\u2019rwah had become liable to pay a blood-mulct, and that his friends had paid it by giving two or three oxen each, but the Ssiddyq had presented U\u2019rwah with two cows [to make up the ransom]. It is related that U\u2019rwah was sitting near his lordship the apostle, and that during the conversation he happened to touch the blessed moustache of that prince; but Moghayrah B. Sha\u2019bah, who was standing by the side of his lordship with a naked sabre, struck U\u2019rwah with the flat blade of it whenever U\u2019rwah approached the blessed beard with his hand, saying: \u2018Be civil, and keep off thy hand from the blessed moustache of the apostle of God.\u2019 After Moghayrah had several times reprimanded him, U\u2019rwah asked: \u2018Who is this man?\u2019 They replied: \u2018Moghayrah B. Sha\u2019bah.\u2019 Then U\u2019rwah turned towards Moghayrah, saying: \u2018Traitor! I am endeavouring to make peace and to remedy thy perfidiousness, and thou repayest me thus!\u2019\n\nWaqidi says: \u2018Moghayrah went with thirteen persons to the King [sic] of Alexandria, who exalted them above himself and made them presents. On their return from Alexandria they were one night carousing, and when, being drunk with wine, they had fallen asleep, Moghayrah was so\noverpowered by covetousness and envy that he killed them all, took possession of their property, went to Madinah, and became a Musalm\u00e2n. His lordship said to him: \"Thy profession of Isl\u00e2m is accepted, but I do not want to have anything to do with thy property, and shall not take the fifth of it.\" When this news spread in Mekkah, and Abu Sofy\u00e2n was apprised thereof, he informed U\u2019rwah B. Masau\u2019d Thaqafi of it. The latter then went several times to the Bani M\u00e2lek and spoke on the subject to Moghayrah, who agreed to pay to their heirs the blood-mulet for the thirteen men he had assassinated. The Bani M\u00e2lek [nevertheless] prepared for revenge, and began to quarrel with the tribe of Moghayrah, who, however, succeeded in quelling the tumult by negotiations and flattery, so that the Bani M\u00e2lek at last agreed to accept the ransom, to pay which U\u2019rwah made himself responsible, whereon peace was restored, and the words spoken by U\u2019rwah to Moghayrah referred to this transaction.' It is related that in the said assembly U\u2019rwah B. Masau\u2019d looked from the corner of his eye at the companions of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014scanning their behaviour, and witnessing how respectfully and how reverently they dealt with the prophet in their words and acts. He took the finger of astonishment between the teeth of amazement, and said on his return to the idolaters: 'O ye Qoraish people, by Allah! I have been in assemblies of kings, I have seen the Kesra, the Qayssar, and the Naj\u00e2shi, but have seen none of their servants honouring them as the companions of Muhammad honour him. I swear by God that when he spat, and the saliva happened to fall on the hand of one of his friends, he smeared it upon his own face, and considered it as an ornament. When he wanted anything to be done, which the meanest could perform, the highest of his people made haste to do it.'\n\nW\u00e2qidi relates that U\u2019rwah said: 'I have seen men who would suffer themselves to be killed for his sake without caring for their lives. As long as one of that company has\n\n231 The sovereigns of Persia, Byzantium and Abyssinia.\nlife remaining in him he will not cease to protect his friend, and will not surrender him to the enemy. Nor will this army turn away from you, except it be annihilated or takes vengeance on you. The conclusion from all this is that you are not to reject the proposal of Muhammad, which only implies your own peace and welfare, and that you ought to believe in and respect his foresight. I give you good advice, and fear that the breeze of victory and conquest will waft in favour of our enemies, because Muhammad has come to glorify the house of Allah.' The Qoraish replied: 'Do not utter words like these; for we shall not allow him to visit the house of the Ka'bah this year. We wish him to return now, and to come next year to circumambulate the house.' After U'rwah had returned, a man of the chiefs of the H\u00e2mysh, whose name was Jalys, desired to meet his holy and prophetic lordship. He obtained permission from the Qoraish, proceeded to the camp of the professors of Isl\u00e2m, and when he arrived near it the apostle of God exclaimed: 'This is a man of the nation which sacrifices camels for the glorification of the Ka'bah! Go and meet him!' The friends obeyed, and Jalys, guessing that they had come on pilgrimage, and not for war, said to himself: 'Praise be to Allah! it is not proper that anyone hinder them from encompassing the Ka'bah.' He then immediately returned without enjoying the felicity of waiting on his lordship, and said to the Qoraish: 'Friends, I have seen the companions of Muhammad, who have prepared camels for the sacrifices and are on their way to visit the house of God. I do not see why you should impede them from visiting the house of the Ka'bah.' The Qoraish replied: 'Be silent, O Jalys! Thou art but a simple Arab, and knowest nought about politics.' Hereon Jalys became angry, and exclaimed: 'O ye Qoraish, I do not agree with you that anyone who comes to visit the Ka'bah and to glorify the house of Allah should be hindered. I swear by that God in whose power the life of Jalys is that if you prohibit Muhammad from going round the Ka'bah I and all the H\u00e2mysh will separate\nfrom you.' The Qoraish thereon excused themselves, saying: 'Let us alone, O Jalys, and we shall conclude peace with Muhammad according to our own wish.'\n\nIn the *Mayhrafatu-s-sah\u00e1bah* it is recorded that his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014gave to Khar\u00e2sh B. Ommyah Khozaa'y a camel, named 'The Fox,' and sent him to Mekkah, to inform the inhabitants of the intention of his lordship the apostle of God\u2014u. w. b. When Khar\u00e2sh arrived in Mekkah the Qoraish followed his camel with the intention of slaying him; but some genii liberated him from the grasp of the idolaters and sent him back to the apostle of God, who, calling O'mar B. Alkhatt\u00e2b after Khar\u00e2sh had waited on him, said: 'Thou must go to Mekkah, and inform the Qoraish that we are not coming to fight, but to visit the house of the Ka'bah.' O'mar replied: 'It is evident to thy discerning mind how greatly the Qoraish are incensed against us, and how much I hate them. As soon as they catch hold of me they will undoubtedly kill me, nor is any one of the Bani A'dy at Mekkah who could protect me against their wicked intentions. It will be more suitable to despatch O'thm\u00e2n B. O'ff\u00e2n, because he is much respected among the Qoraish, and has many clansmen, as well as relatives, in Mekkah.'\n\nThe opinion of F\u00e2ri\u00fbq [i.e., O'mar] having been approved of, Dhu-n-n\u00fbryn was sent to Abu Sofy\u00e2n and the Qoraish chieftains, to inform them of the intentions of that prince. O'thm\u00e2n accordingly started in consequence of the order he had received, and met the idolaters in a place called Yaldah, where he delivered his message, saying: 'His lordship the prophet desires to visit the house of the Ka'bah, and not to fight neighbours nor strangers.' The infidels, however, insisted on prohibiting the paragon of the family of Qossai and the pride of the family of A'bd Mun\u00e2f to circumambulate the Ka'bah, and said: 'This is a matter which we shall never allow. We cannot consent that he should enter Mekkah and visit the house of God.' After that Ay\u00e2n B. Sa'yd B. Ala'ass showed much respect to O'thm\u00e2n, seated him on his own beast, and mounted\nbehind him. Thus they arrived in Mekkah, where Dhu-n-n\u00fbryn delivered the message of the apostle of God to Abu Sofy\u00e2n, and to a number of the Qoraish nobles who had not gone out with the people. All of them agreed, however, in refusing to admit the apostle of God [to the sanctuary of Mekkah]. The Qoraish then said to O\u2019thm\u00e2n: \u2018If thou be so inclined, arise, go and circumambulate the Ka\u2019bah.\u2019 O\u2019thm\u00e2n replied: \u2018I shall not encompass it before the apostle of God has done so.\u2019 At these words the idolaters became so incensed that they would not allow O\u2019thm\u00e2n to depart. It is said that when O\u2019thm\u00e2n had gone to Mekkah, the professors of Isl\u00e2m said in the assembly of his lordship the best of men: \u2018Blessed is O\u2019thman, who has departed to the sanctuary and will visit the Ka\u2019bah!\u2019 The apostle of God, however, replied: \u2018We being hindered from encompassing the Ka\u2019bah, O\u2019thm\u00e2n will likewise not do so.\u2019 On that occasion ten of the Moh\u00e2jer went, with the permission of his holy and prophetic lordship, to Mekkah, and their names are as follows: \u2018J\u00e2ber, and A\u2019bdullah B. Sohayl, and A\u2019yy\u00e2sh B. Rabya\u2019h, and Hesham B. A\u2019bdul-l-a\u2019ass, and Hattub B. Abu Balyghah, and H\u00e2tub B. A\u2019mru, and O\u2019mayr B. Wohob Alhajamy, and A\u2019bdullah B. Abu Khoz\u00e2a\u2019y, and A\u2019bdullah B. Ommyah.\\(^{332}\\) After O\u2019thm\u00e2n\u2019s sojourn in Mekkah had become protracted beyond expectation, it reached the august audition of his holy and prophetic lordship that O\u2019thm\u00e2n had been killed, together with the just-mentioned ten Moh\u00e2jer. Ebn A\u2019bb\u00e2s\u2014u. w. b.\u2014says: \u2018Satan proclaimed that O\u2019thm\u00e2n had been slain at Hodaybiah; and when the rumour of the murder of O\u2019thm\u00e2n became current in the army of Isl\u00e2m the apostle of God leant with his back against a tree, which event God the Most High has recorded in the Qur\u00e2\u0144, saying: \u201cNow Allah was well pleased with the true believers when they swore fidelity unto thee under the tree.\u201d \u2019\\(^{333}\\)\n\nThen the professors of Isl\u00e2m swore fidelity, and promised him to fight the idolaters. Sohayl B. A\u2019mru was, according to a certain tradition, on this occasion, with a number\n\n\\(^{332}\\) These are only nine men, and not ten.\n\n\\(^{333}\\) Qur\u00e2\u0144, ch. xlvi. 18.\nof idolaters, honoured by being admitted into the presence of the prince of apostles and guide on the true road\u2014u. w. b.\u2014for the purpose of negotiating about the delivery of certain Qoraish prisoners, the details of which transaction are as follows: The apostle of God had appointed Awys B. Khauly and A'b\u00e2dah B. Bashyr and Muhammad B. Moslamah in the station of Hodaybiah, to take their turns with a number of the professors of Isl\u00e2m during the night and to keep watch over the victorious army. After O'thm\u00e2n had departed to Mekkah and had not yet returned, the Qoraish sent one night fifty men towards the august camp, with instructions to capture some of the companions of the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014but Muhammad B. Moslamah, who was that night on guard over the camp, succeeded in making them all prisoners, whereon his holy and prophetic lordship placed them in durance, and said: \u2018At the time when God the Most High had ordered me to receive your allegiance the first man who hastened to pay it was Abu San\u00e2nu-l-asdy.\u2019 A'bdu-r-razzaq, who is a biographer and chronicler, states that before the arrival of Sohayl B. A'mru permission had been given by the Qoraish to Mukraz B. Hafdzy to go to the camp of the Musalm\u00e2ns. When his lordship perceived him from a distance, he said to his companions: \u2018This man is a traitor! Speak not with him.\u2019 He, however, himself conversed with him. Meanwhile Sohayl B. A'mru made his appearance with a number of men, and his lordship exclaimed: \u2018Verily our business has been facilitated\\(^{334}\\) to you.\u2019 According to another tradition, he said: \u2018Indeed our affair has been made easy.\u2019 A'bdu-r-razzaq continues: \u2018When Sohayl was honoured by admission into his lordship\u2019s presence, he said: \u201cO Muhammad, the capturing of thy companions was not undertaken by intelligent and wise men, but by a lot of fools, whose undertaking no prudent man approved of. We therefore request thee to liberate a number of our friends who are in the bonds of captivity.\u201d His lordship replied: \u201cI shall not let them\n\n\\(^{334}\\) A play on the words Sal\u00e2l [facilitated] and Sohayl.\ngo until my companions are sent back.\u201d Sohayl rejoined: \u201cThy words are very just.\u201d When the Qoraish heard of this they dismissed O\u2019thm\u00e2n with the ten men whose names have been mentioned above, whereon his lordship also liberated those whom Muhammad B. Moslamah had captured.\n\nIt is said that when, after the covenant [under the tree], the news arrived that O\u2019thm\u00e2n was still alive, his lordship said: \u2018O\u2019thm\u00e2n had departed on the business of God and of His apostle, and I do not want him to be excluded from the blessing of this covenant.\u2019 Then he pointed to his own right hand, saying: \u2018This is the hand of O\u2019thm\u00e2n,\u2019 and to his left, saying: \u2018This is my hand.\u2019 He then placed his hands upon each other, thus symbolizing the covenant for O\u2019thm\u00e2n. Qot\u00e2dah said: \u2018Blessed is the nobleness of O\u2019thm\u00e2n, whose hand is the same with that of the Master of both worlds, and a mercy to mankind.\u2019 But the most correct tradition is that the covenant consisted in the promise not to flee from the battle-field, and it is related of J\u00e2ber\u2014u. w. b.\u2014that he said: \u2018The covenant of content was maintained by all except by Harr B. Qays the hypocrite, and the apostle of God said: \u201cWhoever assisted at the covenant under the tree will enter Paradise, except the possessor of the red camel.\u201d\u2019 Jaber continues: \u2018In that desert Harr B. Qays was searching for his lost camel, and disregarding all my entreaties to swear allegiance to the lord of apostleship, he replied: \u201cI love my camel more than the covenant of allegiance.\u201d\u2019 When Sohayl B. A\u2019mru and his friends saw how joyfully the Musalm\u00e2ns hastened [to pay the said allegiance], suspicion and fear overpowered their minds, and they returned to their people, whom they informed of the great harmony prevalent among the professors of Isl\u00e2m. The Qoraish being also disheartened by this information, despatched Sohayl B. A\u2019mru and Khoyttab B. A\u2019bd\u00fb-l-u\u2019zza and Mukraz B. Hafass to the apostle of God, for the purpose of spreading out the carpet of pacification. Sohayl represented to the discerning mind of his holy and prophetic lordship that the Qoraish would\nconclude a treaty of peace with him, on the condition of his returning home this year, and coming the next to perform the visitation. To this proposal his lordship assented, and the negotiations for peace were drawn up as follows: 'During the space of ten years the Musalmans and the Qoraish idolaters should wage no war against each other, and should be allowed to visit each other's countries without let or hindrance; that they should injure each other's lives and property neither openly nor secretly; that no idolater under the protection of, or professing allegiance to, the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014be injured by the Qoraish, and likewise anyone desirous of joining the latter should not be persecuted by the Musalmans; that the Musalmans should return home this year and come the next on pilgrimage to Mekkah with their arms sheathed, not remaining there longer than three days, nor taking part openly or secretly in the quarrels of their respective allies, or injuring them in any way; that every idolater coming to his lordship without the permission of his chief, and apostatizing from his religion and desiring to profess Islam, be sent back again, but that any Musalm\u00e2n wishing to renounce the Faith, and taking refuge with the Qoraish, be allowed to remain among them.' F\u00e2ri\u00fbq [i.e., O'mar], being astonished at this last clause, exclaimed: 'O apostle of Allah, agreeest thou to this proposal?' His lordship smiled and replied: 'Anyone who comes over to us from them, and we send him back, will be provided with deliverance and relief from Allah the Most High and Glorious, but whoever apostatizes from us, and joins the polytheists, has nothing to hope for and is more fit for their society [than for ours].'\n\nEbn A'm\u00e2rah says: 'His holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014sat in the meeting of pacification with A'b\u00e2dah B. Bashyr Bady\u00ee' and Moslamah B. Aslam Masalah in his rear, and Sohayl B. A'mru was sitting opposite to the apostle of God on the two knees [or rather haunches] of civility. Sohayl sometimes talked loud and sometimes low, but whenever he spoke in the former way he was reproved by A'b\u00e2dah and Moslamah, who said: \"Respect the exalted\nassembly, and do not speak so loud.\u201d The professors of Isl\u00e1m stood in lines opposite to his lordship the apostle, as witnesses, so that not the smallest detail of that meeting has escaped me. On this occasion Abu Jundal B. Sohayl B. A\u2019mru, who had already become a Musalm\u00e1n, but whose father had kept him prisoner, arrived with heavy fetters from the lower end of Mekkah, and, uttering the profession of Faith, threw himself among the Musalm\u00e1ns. Hereon A\u2019mru exclaimed: \u201cMuhammad, this is the first act taking place after our negotiation. Surrender this man to me.\u201d His lordship, however, replied: \u201cWe have not yet finished writing it.\u201d Sohayl rejoined: \u201cIn this manner peace cannot be concluded between you and me.\u201d His lordship continued: \u201cLet alone this man for my sake.\u201d Sohayl, however, refused, and the more the apostle of God insisted on this point, the more unwilling Sohayl became to comply. After that the prophet said: \u201cO Sohayl, do not injure and persecute him after this.\u201d Then Mukraz B. Hafass became security that no harm would befall Abu Jundal, but when the latter understood that he was to be taken back to Mekkah, he said: \u201cO ye Musalm\u00e1ns, would you surrender me\u2014who have become one of you, and have taken shelter with you\u2014to the idolaters? Have you not heard what misery and distress I suffered from the infidels?\u201d These words he spake because the polytheists had tormented him in various ways. His holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014however, said: \u201cBe patient and rejoice. Trust in the reward of Allah, and confide in His mercy, because He will send deliverance to thee and to the other Musalm\u00e1ns who are [persecuted] in Mekkah. At present we have to fulfil a condition we have granted to these people, and it is not our custom to break promises; the first of all in this matter is patience.\u201d And, verily, handsome is the saying:\n\nDistich: Man is delivered of bonds by patience,\nFor the key of fetters is patience.\n\nIt is said that when Sohayl B. A\u2019mru took Abu Jundal away from the Musalm\u00e1ns, he departed with him to Mekkah, accompanied by O\u2019mar B. Al-Khatt\u00e2b, who said\nto Abu Jundal: 'Have patience; for these people are idolaters, whose blood is equivalent to that of dogs,' holding out at the same time the hilt of his sabre to Abu Jundal, because he imagined the latter would draw it out and slay Sohayl B. A'mru; and though he explained his idea also by signs to induce him to kill his own father, Abu Jundal was prevented by his filial affection from realizing the hints of O'mar. It is related that O'mar said: 'On that occasion I hoped Jundal would accept the sword from me and despatch Sohayl B. A'mru, but he would not slay his own father.' In some biographical works we read that when O'mar intimated to Abu Jundal the wish that he should kill his own father, he replied to F\u0101r\u016bq: 'Why slayest thou him not thyself?' And F\u0101r\u016bq rejoined: 'The apostle of God has prohibited me to kill him.' Hereon Abu Jundal said: 'The claims of the apostle of God to my adherence and obedience are as great as thine.'\n\nHistorians have recorded that when the conditions of peace had been enumerated, the reed, ink, and all the materials for writing were produced, whereon his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014ordered Awys B. Khauly, the Anss\u0101ri, to write the treaty of peace. Sohayl B. A'mru, however, interposed, saying: 'O Muhammad, this document ought to be written by thy cousin A'li, or by O'thm\u0101n.' Complying with this suggestion, his lordship the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014said to A'li\u2014u. w. b.: 'Write, in the name of Allah the Merciful, the Clement!' Sohayl exclaimed: 'I swear by Allah that we do not know who the Merciful is. Write, in the name of Allah, as thou hast been accustomed to write before!' The Musalm\u0101ns said: 'We shall not write anything but in the name of Allah the Merciful, the Clement!' Then the apostle of God said: 'O A'li, write: In thy name, O Allah!' A'li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014obeyed the order of the prince of apostles\u2014u. w. b.\u2014whereon his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014continued: 'Write: This is what Muhammad the apostle of Allah has decided.' When A'li had written these words, Sohayl said: 'We do not\nbelieve in thy apostleship, and if we had known that thou art an apostle of Allah we would not have prohibited thee from visiting the Ka'bah. O A'li, write: Muhammad the son of A'bdullah.' His lordship continued: 'Ali, blot out the \"apostle\" and write in lieu of that word: the son of A'bdullah' (and not 'Muhammad, the son of A'bdullah,' as is stated in the Raudzatu-l-\u0101\u1e25b\u0101b, and in some other books). When his lordship the apostle ordered A'li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014to blot out the word 'apostle of Allah' A'li replied: 'No, by Allah! I shall not expunge the word of thy apostleship.' According to another tradition Sohayl B. A'mru said: 'A'li, blot out \"the apostle of Allah,\" or I shall break off this negotiation of peace.' Hereon the Commander of the faithful threw away the leaf, and wanted to draw his sword, but his lordship the apostle said: 'Let it alone.' Ali the Commander of the Faithful then said: 'O apostle of Allah, my respect and veneration for thee prohibit me to blot out that word.' At last his lordship the Mussttafa\u2014u. w. b.\u2014took the leaf, and himself blotted out the word 'apostle.' Some allege that, although he had never [before] written anything, he wrote, instead of the above word, 'the son of A'bdullah' in an abridged form; but according to others he [merely] ordered Ali to do so. The names of the Musalm\u0101ns who signed the above document were as follows: Abu Bakr B. Abu Kuh\u0101fah, and O'mar B. Alkhatt\u0101b, and A'bdu-r-rahman B. A'wuf, and Sa'd B. Abu Wqq\u0101s, and O'thm\u0101n B. O'ff\u0101n, and Abu O'baydah Al-jurr\u0101h, and Muhammad B. Moslamah, and Abu Jundal B. Sohayl; and of the infidels the following: Hawyttab B. A'bdu-l-u'zza, and Mukraz B. Hafass, and many others. The Bani Khoza'a'h joined the prophet, and the Bani Bakr the Qoraish. When the writing of the treaty of peace was completed the apostle turned his blessed face to A'li, saying: 'Something like this must necessarily befall thee likewise.' In accordance with these words, it happened that when A'li the Commander of the Faithful had, for the purpose of combating Abu Sofy\u0101n, marched to Ssaffyn, and after a protracted contest peace\nwas concluded\u2014as will be recorded below\u2014the clerk wrote: 'This is the Treaty of Peace of A'li the Commander of the Faithful,' Moa'wiah said: 'Blot out the phrase \"Commander of the Faithful,\" and write, \"The son of Abu Ttaleb\"; for, if I had believed him to be the Commander of the Faithful, I would not have fought against him, but would have obeyed him.' A'li the Amir of the true believers exclaimed: 'The apostle of Allah has spoken the truth. Write what Moa'wiah tells thee.'\n\nLearned biographers relate that when the treaty of Hodaybiah was concluded the friends [of the prophet] became very sad and melancholy, because they imagined that during this year the dream of his lordship the prophet would be realized, that they would conquer Mekkah, and that the Musalmans would enter the sanctuary as friends, and would perform the ceremonies of the pilgrimage. Also the devil, driven away with stones, inspired the professors of Isl\u00e2m with doubts unbecoming to their truth and sincerity, as F\u00e2r\u00fbq himself related, saying: 'On that day I revolved a great matter in my mind, went to the apostle of God, and said: \"Art thou a prophet in reality?\" He said \"Yes.\" I continued: \"Are we not right, and our foes wrong?\" He replied: \"Yes.\" I asked: \"Then why do we put up with all this scorn and humiliation, and are returning after having submitted to this degradation and made peace?\" He replied: \"I am the apostle of Allah, and do not disobey Him; He is my Protector and Helper.\"\n\nAccording to another tradition, however, he said: 'I am the apostle of God, and He will not abandon me.' O'mar continues: 'I said: \"O apostle of God, hast thou not promised me that we shall soon go to Mekkah and walk round the house of the Ka'bah?\" He said \"Yes.\" I asked: \"Will it be this year?\" He answered, \"No,\" and added: \"O'mar, be not sad; for thou shalt visit the Ka'bah and circumambulate it.\" F\u00e2r\u00fbq says: 'Sad and depressed as I was in the assembly of the apostle of God, I went to Abu Bakr and narrated to him the above conversation, but\n\n336 Qur\u00e2n, ch. xv. 17.\nreceived the same reply from him as from the apostle of God.' According to another tradition, Ssiddyq replied to F\u0101r\u016bq: 'He is the apostle of God, and whatever he does he does by revelation, and it would have been proper for thee not to disobey or to contradict him.' It is related that Abu O'baydah Jurr\u0101h said to O'mar: 'Muhammad is the apostle of God the Most High and Glorious; whatever he does is right and correct. O O'mar, beware of the snares of Satan, and take refuge with God against them.' F\u0101r\u016bq says: 'It is a long time since I have repented and asked pardon for my objections against the prince of the righteous\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and have devoted myself to good works, such as prayers, fasting, almsgiving, and the manumission of slaves, hoping that they would become a propitiation for my transgressions.'\n\nIt is related that on the day [of the peace] of Hodaybiah O'mar and a number of his companions said to his holy and prophetic lordship: 'O apostle of God, hast thou not said, \"I shall enter the mosque of the sanctuary, take the keys of the Ka'bah in my hands, get my head shaved in the valley of Mekkah, and shall abide in A'rafat\"?' His lordship asked: 'Have I said that all these things will take place during this journey?' O'mar replied: 'No, O apostle of God.' Then the prophet turned to O'mar, and said: 'You have forgotten that when you were fleeing on the day of Ohod, and I called, not one of you took notice of it. Have you forgotten that on the Day of the Confederates, when the enemies were approaching you from above and from below, the promise of God the Most High was fulfilled?' In the same manner he reminded the Musalm\u0101ns of many other occasions and places where they had been protected by Divine favour, so that they all said: 'What God and His prophet declare is true. Thy penetration cannot be fathomed by our intellects, and thy acquaintance with God the Most High, His orders and His mysteries, is greater than ours.' In the year of 'the decreed pilgrimage,' however, when his lordship entered\n\n336 This is also the title of ch. xxxiii. of the Qur\u0101n.\nMekkah, he got his blessed head shaved, turned to his companions, and said: \u2018This is what I have promised you;\u2019 and when he took in \u2018the year of victory\u2019 the key of the Ka\u2019bah into his hand, he called O\u2019mar, and said: \u2018This is what I have told you.\u2019\n\nIt is related that during the negotiations at Hodaybiah as many infidels became Musalm\u00e1ns as [had become such] from the beginning [of Isl\u00e2m] till that period of time. Ssiddyq says: \u2018There was no victory in Isl\u00e2m equal to the Peace of Hodaybiah, but the understandings of the professors could not comprehend it, because it was a secret known only to the apostle of God and to the Creator. The pious were in haste, but the Lord God Most High is free from precipitation.\u2019 Ssiddyq says: \u2018I swear by God that in the Hajjatu-l-wodaa\u2019 [pilgrimage of valediction] I have seen Sohayl B. A\u2019mru bringing a camel destined for a sacrifice to his holy and prophetic lordship, and he cut the throat of it with his own blessed hand. Then Sohayl called for a barber to shave the head of that prince; and when the shaving of the head of the prophet was completed, I noticed Sohayl picking up the blessed hairs, rubbing them over both his eyes, and considering them tantamount to the felicity of this and of the next world. Then I remembered [the contrast], how he had on the day of Hodaybiah demurred to the words \u201cIn the name of Allah the Merciful, the Clement\u201d being written in the Treaty, and would not allow the words \u201cMuhammad the apostle of Allah\u201d to remain on that page.\u2019\n\nThe texts of biographical works inform us that when the foundations of peace had been laid between the professors of obedience and rebellion, his lordship said to his companions: \u2018Arise; slaughter the camels you brought for presentation! Shave your heads! Let no one budge from this place!\u2019 The apostle of God thrice repeated the order to kill the animals and shave heads, but no one obeyed. His lordship then very angrily stepped into the tent of Omm Solmah, one of his spouses, most distinguished for her intellect and penetration. She asked: \u2018O apostle\nof God, what has happened to thee?' That prince replied: 'I am astonished at the people whom I ordered to slaughter the presentation camels and to shave their own heads; not one, however, obeyed my command, although they had heard my words and looked at me.' Omm Solmah answered: 'O apostle of God, pardon them, for they thought they would conquer Mekkah this year, but all their wishes have been frustrated, whereas all the demands of the opponents have been complied with. If thy most noble mind is bent on slaying the camels and shaving, then go out and speak not a word to anyone until thou hast slaughtered thy own camels of presentation and hast shaved thine own head. After seeing thee do this, thy companions will have no other remedy but to follow thy example.' His lordship acted according to the advice of Omm Solmah, and when the companions saw what was going on they cut the throats of their camels, some shaved their heads, and others picked up the hairs; but from the great depression and grief which had overpowered their minds, they were almost ready to kill each other, and on that day his lordship said: 'O God, forgive the tardy ones!' Some say he added, 'And the deficient,' repeating the last word four times. Then they asked: 'O apostle of God, what was the reason thou hast repeatedly prayed for the deficient, and hast confined thyself only to one invocation with reference to the tardy?' He replied with his wonderfully eloquent tongue: 'Because they [i.e., the tardy] did not doubt.' It is related that among the presentation camels that of Abu Jahl bad escaped and had gone to his home, the driver of his lordship pursuing it all the time. The fools among the people were unwilling to give it up, but Sohayl B. A'mru said: 'You may keep this camel if you give one hundred others instead of it.' The Qoraish despatched a courier to his holy and prophetic lordship, promising to give one hundred camels for that of Abu Jahl. The apostle of God\u2014u. w. b.\u2014replied: 'Had that camel not been appointed for presentation I would have complied with your request.' It is said that the apostle of God sent\ntwenty camels, among which was also that of Abu Jahl, with N\u0101hyah B. Jundal to Mekkah to be slaughtered, and for their meat to be distributed among the poor and destitute. The policy of sending [also] the camel of Abu Jahl to Mekkah to be slain was to distress the minds of the idolaters.\n\nAll the [other] presentation camels were sacrificed at Hodaybiah and distributed among worthy persons; some, however, allege that this was done at Madinah. When the sacrifice and the shaving of heads had terminated, God the Most High sent a great wind, which carried the hairs of the Musalm\u00e1ns to Mekkah, and scattered them in the sanctuary. His lordship threw the blessed hairs of his head on a tree which was near, and the companions struggled among themselves to obtain possession of them. O\u2019mm\u00e1rah says: \u2018I made great efforts and got hold of a single hair, which I washed; and to whatever sick person I administered the water thereof he recovered his health.\u2019\n\nIt is related that the greater Far\u016bq said: \u2018When we departed from Hodaybiah I accompanied the apostle of God, and asked him something thrice, but obtained no reply. Therefore I said to myself: \u201cMay thy mother become childless, O O\u2019mar! Thou hast been displeased with the proceedings of the apostle of God, and therefore he has given thee no reply.\u201d After that I quickly impelled my camel so as to precede the army, fearing that on account of my having manifested displeasure to the apostle of God, with reference to the conclusion of the Treaty of Peace, a verse of the Qur\u00e1n might be revealed concerning me; but after I had advanced a short distance I heard a man exclaim: \u201cO\u2019mar B. Alkhatt\u00e1b, the apostle of God is calling thee!\u201d My fear increased at these words. I hastened, however, to wait on that prince, proffered my salutation, which he returned, and I perceived marks of joy shining on his august forehead. He then said: \u201cThou hast asked me something, but I gave thee no reply, because I was absorbed with a Divine revelation; and this evening a chapter has descended which I love more than anything\nthe sun shines upon.\u201d After that he began to recite the chapter \u201cVerily we have given thee a manifest victory,\u201d and congratulated the companions, who likewise offered their felicitations to his lordship. Some commentators [of the Qur\u00e2n] allege that the \u2018manifest victory\u2019 signifies the Peace of Hodaybiah, because it was the first of many [subsequent] victories. After it some blessed persons, who had heretofore kept their faith secret in Mekkah, professed it openly, disputed with the idolaters, and recited the evident signs [i.e., verses of the Qur\u00e2n] to them, by which means many of those who had been straying in the desert of aberration were exalted by entering the road of guidance, as has been recorded before. In those days also the Peace of Khayber, which was one of the greatest victories in Isl\u00e2m, was concluded, as will be narrated in detail in these pages, if it pleaseth Allah the Most High. Other commentators, however, consider the \u2018manifest victory\u2019 to mean the victory of Khayber or the victory of Mekkah; but Allah the Most High knows best.\n\n**Abu Bassyr comes from Mekkah to Madinah, but again returns, by Order of his Lordship the Refuge of Apostleship\u2014U. W. B.**\n\nWhen the prince of existences\u2014the most excellent salutations to him!\u2014returned from the station of Hodaybiah and arrived in Madinah, Abu Bassyr, who was an ally of Abu Zohrah, professed the faith, fled from Mekkah, and, performing the journey on foot, arrived in the space of seven days in Madinah. On that occasion Ahsan B. Sharyq and Azhar B. A\u2019bd A\u2019wuf wrote a letter to the apostle of God and sent it by a man named Kawther, of the tribe Bani A\u2019amer. This epistle of the idolaters Abu B. Ka\u2019b conveyed to his lordship, who learnt from the contents thereof that he was in conformity with the Treaty of Peace of Hodaybiah required to send back Abu Bassyr. His holy and prophetic lordship accordingly surrendered the\n\n---\n\n337 Qur\u00e2n ch. xlvi. begins with these words.\nman to them, whereon Abu Bassyr exclaimed: 'O apostle of God, sendest thou me to the idolaters, who will certainly persecute and injure me, and will suggest to me doubts concerning my religion?' But his lordship answered: 'Verily thou knowest that we have made a treaty with the Qoraish, and that treachery is against our religion.'\n\nDistich: A man who breaks a treaty\nIs capable also of any other crime.\n\nHe also said: 'Depart, therefore, and God will comfort thee and the Musalm\u00e2ns [who are in Mekkah].' The noble companions likewise took affectionate leave of Abu Bassyr, whereon the above-mentioned two idolaters started with him to Mekkah. When they reached Dhu-l-halyfah they halted to rest themselves, but Abu Bassyr entered the mosque, prayed with two flexions, and then placed his provisions in front of himself, offering them also to his two companions, who, however, replied: 'We have no need of thy food.' Then Abu Bassyr said with perfect kindness and affability: 'Had you invited me to partake of your victuals, I would have complied with your wish.' Hereat they were ashamed, brought forth their food, and all ate together. They were conversing with each other familiarly; Abu Bassyr asked for the name and genealogy of the A'ameri, and said: 'Thy sword appears to be a good one.' The A'ameri then drew it from the scabbard, and said: 'It is a very excellent sword; I have often tried it, and found it efficient.' Abu Bassyr replied: 'Show me the sabre, that I may examine it.' Hereon the A'ameri, being careless and unsuspicious, gave his sharp scimitar to Abu Bassyr, whereon the latter killed him with a single blow of it. Kawther [the surviving A'ameri] made his appearance in Madinah about the afternoon prayers, and waited on his lordship, who, catching sight of him from a distance, said: 'This is a man who has returned.' According to another tradition, he said: 'Verily this man is frightened.' While this man was relating that he had escaped death, and was even now in danger of being killed, Abu Bassyr also arrived, girded with the sword of the [killed] A'ameri and\nriding on a camel. He waited on his lordship, and said: 'O apostle of God, thou hast kept thy word, and hast sent me back, but God the Most High and Glorious has delivered me from their hands.' His lordship replied: 'He would indeed be a firebrand of war if anyone were to aid him.' By these words he alluded to the flight of Abu Bassyr, and hinted that the professors of Isl\u00e2m, who were guarded and restrained in Mekkah, ought to [follow his example and] join him. Therefore as soon as Abu Bassyr had understood the import of these words he fled immediately, not halting in any place till he reached the station of A\u2019yss, which was on the seashore. F\u00e2r\u00fbq then sent to the professors of monotheism, who were confined in Mekkah, a message of what his lordship the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had said concerning Abu Bassyr, and when Abu Jundal had heard these words he preferred flight to permanency, and joined Abu Bassyr. In course of time the Musalm\u00e2ns fled one by one [from Mekkah] to join him, so that, according to the tradition giving the smallest number, at least seventy of them assembled around him, and as the caravans of the Qoraish usually passed through that locality [i.e., the station of A\u2019yss], they watched their opportunity and plundered them. The idolaters being distressed by this proceeding, despatched Abu Sofy\u00e2n B. Harb to his lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014to request him through the intercession of another individual [who had influence with the prophet] to summon Abu Bassyr and his comrades to Madinah, and [this having been done] the Qoraish revoked the condition [of the Treaty of Hodaybiah] that any one of them taking refuge with Muhammad should be surrendered to them. Therefore that maniferer of pity complied with the request of the opponents, and wrote a letter to Abu Bassyr ordering him and his friends to come to Madinah; that epistle, however, reached Abu Bassyr when he was in the agony of death. He nevertheless took it into his hands, rubbed it over his face, complaining of the hardship of separation, till he was received into the mercy of God and [departed] to the gardens of paradise.\nAbu Jundal with all his companions shrouded and buried Abu Bassyr, started for Madinah, and after performing the journey waited on the prince of former and of latter days.\n\n**Ambassadors are sent to the Sovereigns, Rulers, and Judges of that Epoch.**\n\nWhen the apostle began to entertain the idea of sending letters to the Sultans of various countries inviting them to profess Isl\u00e2m, many persons represented to him that, according to the usages of kings, letters bearing no seal are considered worthless; therefore the prince of men and best of the sons of Adam\u2014u. w. b.\u2014ordered a ring to be made of gold, and his example was followed by the companions, all of whom put rings on their fingers. Then his lordship ordered a ring to be made of silver, the circle and the full seal whereof are also said to have been of silver. He ordered the words \u2018Muhammad, apostle of Allah,\u2019 to be engraved thereon in three lines, which having been done, the words \u2018of Allah\u2019 appeared on the first, \u2018apostle\u2019 on the second, and \u2018Muhammad\u2019 on the third line. After that he ordered six epistles addressed to six of the adjoining kings to be written, and handed each of them to one of his companions, whereon they departed to their respective destinations.\n\nThe letter to the Najj\u00e2shy, the King of Abyssinia, was given to A\u2019mru B. Ommyah Dhomayry; that of Harkal the Hakum of R\u00fbm to Dahyah Kalby; the epistle of Khosru Parviz, the Sovereign of Persia, to A\u2019bdullah B. Hud\u00e2qah Sahmy; the letter of Maqoqush, the Governor of Alexandria, to H\u00e2tub B. Abu Multa\u2019ah; the letter of H\u00e2reth B. Abu Shamm\u00e2r, King of Syria, to Shujaa\u2019 B. Wohb Asdy; and the letter of Haud Jayfy, Governor of Yamamah, was given to Salytt B. A\u2019mru A\u2019amery.\n\n---\n\n338 The inscription, to be read from below upwards, was, \u2018Muhammad, apostle of Allah.\u2019\n\n339 I.e., Heraclius, Emperor of Byzantium.\n\n340 Ce gouverneur \u00e9tait un Egyptien de naissance qu\u2019on appelait Makaukes.\u2014Reinaud, \u2018Notice sur Mahomet,\u2019 p. 28.\nWhen O'mnru B. Ommyah Dhomayry delivered the letter to his majesty the Najj\u00e2shy, King of Abyssinia, he descended from the throne of dignity, sat down on the ground of humility, and ordered the exalted letter to be read in the assembly. The said letter began with the praise and glorification of Allah the Most High and an allusion to I'sa [Jesus]\u2014u. w. b.\u2014concluding with an invitation to the Najj\u00e2shy to make profession of Isl\u00e1m. As soon as the king had understood the contents of the noble epistle of his holy and prophetic lordship, he immediately made his profession of the Faith, and, having written a handsome reply, he despatched it to Madinah. Accordingly, when the Najj\u00e2shy died, the apostle of God said: 'Pray for your companion,' and ordered funeral orisons to be held; and though the corpse of the Najj\u00e2shy was not present, his lordship held prayers with four Takbyrs. The people, however, not aware of his being a believer, said: 'How does he [i.e., the prophet] recite prayers for an individual who was not a Musalm\u00e1n and died in Abyssinia?' Therefore the Most High and Glorious revealed the verse, 'There are some of those who have received the scriptures who believe in Allah,'\\(^{341}\\) as far as the words 'swift in taking an account.'\\(^{342}\\)\n\nAs for Dahyah Kalby, who had received orders from his lordship first to go to Bossra, in Syria, and to request the governor of that place to send a man with him for the purpose of conveying the august epistle to Heraclius, he acted as he had been told, but when he arrived at Bossra the governor of that region was at Hamss, to which place Dahyah followed him. There the Governor of Bossra gave him a man to assist him to convey the joy-boding and felicity-bringing letter of the asylum of apostleship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014to Heraclius, the Emperor of Byzantium, who was at that time on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. It is related that Heraclius had made a vow that in case he should recover some Byzantine provinces which Khosru Parviz had occupied, and if the Greeks conquered the\n\n\\(^{341}\\) Quran, ch. iii. 198.\n\n\\(^{342}\\) Ibid., 199.\nPersians, he would walk barefooted from Constantinople to Jerusalem, and would offer his adoration to God the Most High in the farther temple. When, therefore, the [Byzantine] Greeks had, by Divine favour, vanquished the Persians, as is related in detail in historical works, the Qaissar was anxious to fulfil his vow, ordered carpets to be spread along the road, strewed with roses and aromatic flowers, and having in this manner journeyed to Jerusalem, he fulfilled his vow. The Qaissar was one day reclining, sad and melancholy, on the throne of sovereignty in the just-mentioned holy city, and some courtiers said on that occasion to him: 'We behold thee sad and grieved, but know not the cause.' He replied: 'I have yesterday learnt from the position of the heavenly bodies that the king of the circumcised has made his appearance, and that they will soon stretch forth the hand of tyranny to this region and kingdom of ours. I wonder what people they are who practise circumcision?' They answered: 'There is no other nation except the Jews who do so, and it will be proper to write to the governors of the provinces to kill every Jew they can find.' Meanwhile it was brought to the notice of the Qaissar that a courier had arrived from H\u0101reth B. Abu Shamm\u0101r Ghus\u0101ry, the Governor of Syria, and had brought with him an Arab, who was narrating a strange event which had taken place in Arabia in consequence of the vicissitudes of time. The Qaissar accordingly ordered the Arab to be brought in, examined him on the subject, and received the following answer: 'Among us a man has appeared who says that he is a prophet. Many believe his words and obey him, while others accuse him of falsehood and reject his claims. The dispute of the two parties ended with bloodshed, and many have been killed on both sides.' Hereon the Qaissar said: 'Take this man into a corner and see whether he is circumcised or not.' On examination it was found that his prepuce had been cut off. The Qaissar then asked him: 'Is circumcision a custom among the Arabs?' He said: 'Yes.' Heraclius continued: 'What has become known to me\nfrom astrological indications points to the appearance of the king of this nation.' It is related that when Dahyah arrived with the messenger of the Governor of Syria at the court of the Qaissar, he said to the courtiers: 'I have brought a letter from Madinah.' They replied to him: 'When thou perceivest the emperor, prostrate thyself before him, or else he will not accept thy letter.' Dahyah replied: 'I prostrate myself to no one except to the Creator;' and these words frightened the Greeks. In short, Dahyah obtained an audience and delivered his letter; but when the superscription thereof was perceived to be in Arabic, an interpreter had to be called. That pleasant epistle contained an invitation to profess the Musalm\u00e2n religion and to abstain from Satanic superstitions. It terminated with the verse 'O ye to whom the Scriptures have been given, come to a just determination between us and you, that we worship Allah alone, and associate nothing with Him, and that the one of us take not the other for lords, but Allah alone; if, however, they turn back, say: Bear witness that we are true believers.'\n\nWhen Heraclius had understood the contents of the letter, he said to his courtiers: 'Search whether there is in this country any man who follows the individual who pretends to be a prophet, so that we may examine him minutely concerning the affairs of Muhammad.' The people then made inquiries, and happened to discover Abu Sofy\u00e2n B. Harb, who had at that time arrived in the country with a number of the Qoraish for the purpose of trading. They were all brought to Jerusalem by order of Heraclius. Abu Sofy\u00e2n says: 'One day when Heraclius was sitting on the throne of royalty with his ministers, grandees, and nobles of the kingdom, as well as Sabaeans and monks, all in their proper places, we were brought into the assembly. When the Qaissar perceived us he ordered the interpreters to ask us: \"Who of you is nearest to the man who claims to be a prophet?\" To this question of the interpreter I replied: \"With respect to consanguinity, I am the nearest to him among\n\n343 Qur\u00e2\u00ee, ch. iii. 57:\nthese men.\" He continued: \"What relationship is there between thee and him?\" I replied: \"We are cousins.\" After that Heraclius said: \"Bring him nearer to me, and keep his companions in his rear, so that if he speaks lies they may not be ashamed to look him in the face, but [nevertheless] accuse him of falsehood.\" He then said to the interpreter: \"Tell these men that I shall ask Abu Sofy\u00e2n about several things concerning that man who lays claim to prophecy, and if he tells a lie they must apprize me thereof.\" Abu Sofy\u00e2n continues: 'First Heraclius asked: \"What is the origin and family of that man among you?\"\n\n'A. S.: His family is noble in our tribe.\n\n'H.: Has anyone before him made such a claim in your nation?\n\n'A. S.: No.\n\n'H.: Has any of his fathers and ancestors enjoyed so great a dignity, or that of royalty?\n\n'A. S.: No.\n\n'H.: Do the rich and the strong, or the poor and the weak, among you follow him?\n\n'A. S.: Mostly the poor and the weak.\n\n'H.: Are his followers day by day increasing or diminishing?\n\n'A. S.: They are augmenting.\n\n'H.: Is anyone hating his religion?\n\n'A. S.: No.\n\n'H.: Is he committing treachery or breaking any agreement?\n\n'A. S.: Heretofore he has not done so; but now a treaty of peace has been concluded between us and him, but we know not whether he will keep it or not.'\n\nAbu Sofy\u00e2n continues: 'After these words I could say nothing to disparage Muhammad; but I swear by God that the Qaissar took no notice of my embarrassment, but continued to question me:\n\n'H.: Has there been war and strife between you and him?'\n'A. S.: Yes.\n\n'H.: What was the result?\n\n'A. S.: Sometimes we were victorious and sometime he, namely, on the day of Bedr and in the battle of Ohod [respectively].\n\n'H.: What is it he desires you to do?\n\n'A. S.: To adore the Lord who has no equal; he also tells us not to associate any partner with Him, to renounce the dogmas and acts of our forefathers, to practise orisons, fasting, truth, alms-giving, modesty, and kindness towards our relatives.\n\n'H.: First I asked about the family of this man, and thou hast replied that he is of noble descent among you. Be aware that prophets and apostles are of noble descent, so that the dust of shame and dishonour may not settle on the skirts of anyone who follows them. Then I asked whether any one before him had in your country broached similar claims, and thou hast replied in the negative; because if any one had done so, I would say that he follows and imitates another man in his assertions. I asked whether anyone of his forefathers had been a king, and thou hast said no; for if any one of his ancestors had been a sovereign, I would say that he wants to make his claim to prophecy a stepping-stone to the kingdom of his father. Then I asked whether the strong and the wealthy, or the feeble and the poor, are following him, and thou hast said that the weak and the poor adhere to him; but mostly such people follow prophets. I asked whether his followers are augmenting or decreasing, and thou hast said that they are on the increase. Such is the case with religion, which is augmented by degrees until it is completed. I further asked whether anyone hates his law and again abandons his religion, and thou hast replied in the negative. True religion is such that the sweetness thereof settles in the hearts and becomes mixed with the soul. I further asked whether he had among you ever been accused of lying, and thou hast said no. This indicates that a man who abstains from deceiving men will not utter falsehoods about God the\nMost High. I asked what was the result of your fighting, and thou hast replied that sometimes thy party, and at others his, was victorious. Such is the case with prophets and apostles, that on some occasions they are tried by reverses, but are at last distinguished by victory and conquest. I further asked whether he commits treachery, and thou hast denied it. Prophets do not break treaties, because their object is eternal beatitude, and whoever covets [only] pleasure in this world will fail to keep his covenants. I asked what he had enjoined you, and thou hast replied that he commanded you to adore God the Most High, to believe in His unity, to hold prayers, to keep fasts, and the like. These are the most approved qualities and customs of prophets, and if what thou hast said about Muhammad is in accordance with truth, he will soon conquer these regions, and they will obey his behests. I knew for a certainty that such a prophet will be sent, but I had no idea that he would be of your nation. Had I suspected that I would be blessed by being allowed to kiss his feet, I would have made haste to do so, and would have been honoured by meeting, following, and obeying him.'\n\nAfter that Heraclius caused the letter of the apostle of God to be brought and to be read in the assembly, and I saw that from awe of it water trickled down his forehead. He expressed what he had in his mind, whereon conversations and disputes arose in the assembly, voices became loud, plaints and lamentations resounded, and we were led out from the hall of audience. Abu Sofyan continues: 'When we came out of the court of Heraclius I said to my companions: \"The affairs of the son of Kabshah\\textsuperscript{344} have reached such a pitch that the King of the Greeks\\textsuperscript{345} fears him.'\n\nSome allege that Abu Kabshah was a man of the tribe Kozza', who had opposed the Qoraish, and who, having abandoned idolatry, worshipped the Dog-star [Syrius], and\n\n\\textsuperscript{344} Opprobrious epithet of Muhammad described in Note 256.\n\n\\textsuperscript{345} The original words are Bani-l-asafar, 'the tribe [literally the sons] of the yellow,' because the complexion of the Greeks was fair or yellowish.\nsometimes the Qoraish called his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014likewise by that name, on account of his opposition to their religion. Others, however, are of opinion that this was the name of one of his lordship\u2019s ancestors, it being customary among the Arabs, when they want to insult a man, to call him by the name of one of his forefathers who was worthless or of no account. It is not concealed to the luminous intellects of the blessed, who are acquainted with the whole, as well as with the details of the life of the prince of existences, that numerous traditions concerning the interview of Dahyah Kalby with the Qaissar are recorded in biographical works; but if all of them were to be mentioned here they would only fatigue the hearer [or rather reader]. For this reason prolixity has been avoided in this place, and in future the gently trotting [steed, the] reed will likewise abstain from lengthening out its bridle. Guidance, however, and favour come from Allah.\n\nThe Boldness and Presumption of Khosru Parviz, and Explanation of what took place among all the Kings after they had perused the Epistles inviting them to believe in the Mission of his Lordship and to acknowledge the Unity of God the Most High.\n\nWhen A\u2019bdullah B. Hud\u00e2qah arrived in the metropolis of Khosru he brought the noble epistle to his notice. When Khosru became acquainted with the contents thereof, and had learnt that the blessed name of his lordship the apostle was written before his own, he became angry, and, tearing the letter to pieces, said:\n\nDistich: \u2018Who has the boldness, in contempt of my station,\nTo write his name over mine in this fashion?\u2019\n\nAfter uttering some more nonsense, he turned to A\u2019bdullah B. Hud\u00e2qah, but wrote no answer. When this news was brought to Madinah, his lordship exclaimed: \u2018Allah has torn his kingdom to pieces;\u2019 meaning, \u2018Khosru has torn my letter to shreds, but God the Most High will tear his\nkingdom to pieces.' In his great displeasure and trouble Khosru sent a message of the following purport to B\u0101d\u0101n, his governor in the country of Yemen: 'At present the rumour is current that an individual of the people of Hejaz claims to be a prophet in the Arab country. Send two of thy confidential and shrewd men to capture and to bring that individual to me.' B\u0101d\u0101n obeyed the orders of the Kesra, and appointed his treasurer, who was adorned with the decorations of intellect and bravery, and whose name was B\u0101buyah, to depart in the company of another man named Khar-Kharah, who was also noted for his excellent qualities, to the country of Arabia and to convey his lordship to Khosru Parviz. He also wrote a letter with reference to this subject, which he sent to the apostle of God, whose circumstances B\u0101buyah was to examine and to ascertain. Both these individuals, who were Persians, started according to the instructions they had received, and when they arrived in Tt\u0101yf they happened to meet a number of Qoraish chiefs, such as Abu Sofy\u0101n and Ssafulw\u0101n B. Ommyah, with others who were there at that time. They made inquiries about the habitation of the prince of existences\u2014to whom the most excellent salutations\u2014and the Qoraish idolaters were delighted, saying: 'The business of Muhammad cannot succeed, since a king like the Kesra has become his enemy.' After duly performing the distance, the messengers of B\u0101d\u0101n arrived at last in the assembly of the prince of former and of latter times, in which B\u0101buyah commenced to speak as follows: 'The Sh\u0101hanshah [Khosru] has written a letter to B\u0101d\u0101n, who is his governor in the country of Yemen, ordering him to send thee with some confidential persons to the court, and the viceroy B\u0101d\u0101n has appointed me to convey thee to the residence of Khosru Parviz, if thou desirest to accompany us, so that B\u0101d\u0101n may write a letter to the king of kings, which will be advantageous to thee, and will cause him to draw the line of pardon over what has been done by thee. If, however, thou refusest, thou art aware of the Kesra's severity and power. Thou knowest what kind of a man he is, that he\nwill destroy thee with thy people, will ravage thy country, and transform it into a desert. See! B\u00e2d\u00e2n has sent thee a letter, inviting thee to obey and to start with us.' Then the epistle of the governor of Yemen was handed to his holy and prophetic lordship, who, when he had heard and understood the contents thereof, smiled, and invited the envoys to make profession of Isl\u00e2m, but they replied: 'Muhammad, rise, and let us go to the king of kings, for if thou refusest the Sh\u00e2hanshah will not leave a single Arab alive, and will expel the inhabitants from their country.\n\nIt is related that, although B\u00e2buyah and Khar-Kharah uttered impertinent words and spoke very boldly, they were nevertheless so awestruck by the dignity of the august assembly that their whole bodies trembled in such a manner that their joints almost separated from each other. In that audience they also requested his holy and prophetic lordship that if he would not come himself [at least] to write a reply to B\u00e2d\u00e2n's letter. His lordship, however, said: 'Return ye to-day to your lodging, and come again to-morrow, that I may see what is proper.' When the messengers left the prophet, the one said to the other: 'Had he retained us any longer in his assembly, we might possibly have died from awe of him.' The other said: 'In my whole life I have not experienced sensations like those which overpowered me this day in the company of that man. He appears to be aided by Divine favour, and his affair is the affair of God.'\n\nIt is related that B\u00e2buyah and Khar-Kharah wore golden bracelets on their arms, were dressed in garments of brocade, and wore belts of silver. Their beards were shaved, but they had moustaches covering their lips. When his lordship beheld them attired in this style, he exclaimed: 'Woe betide you! Who has ordered you to turn out in this shape? For verily you are worthy to be burnt in fire! Who has commanded you to shave your beards and to leave your moustaches?' They replied: 'Our nourisher, namely, Khosru Parviz.' The apostle of God then said:\n'But my nourisher has ordered me to clip my moustache and to leave my beard.'\n\nIn short, when the next day the envoys of B\u00e2d\u00e2n [again] waited on the elected one of the Bountiful Sovereign, he said: 'Tell your master [B\u00e2d\u00e2n] that my nourisher will this night kill his lord, namely, Khosru, and has appointed his own son Shiruiah to rip open his belly after seven hours of the night have elapsed.' That night was Tuesday, the tenth of the month Jom\u00e2di the first, in the seventh year after the Flight. His lordship further said to the envoys: 'Tell your master that my religion will soon make its appearance in the realm of the Kesra, and that I shall allow him to retain all his possessions on condition that he becomes a Musalm\u00e2n.' They replied: 'We shall write down these words, but reports of less import than these [words of thine] have been made to thee concerning the king of kings, and have become the occasion of all this enmity and disquietude; and threats like these are sure to call for vengeance.' His holy and prophetic lordship said: 'Write [whatever you like].' Then he presented Khar-Kharah with a belt of wrought silver and gold, which had been sent to his lordship by a king [on some former occasion].\n\nThe envoys having been dismissed without a letter by his lordship, departed from Madinah and afterwards arrived in Yemen, where they reported to B\u00e2d\u00e2n everything they had learnt about the apostle of God, and saying: 'O governor, we have had audiences of many kings, but, by Allah! we were not afraid in any assembly as in the company of that man.' B\u00e2d\u00e2n asked: 'Is he maintaining any spies and guards?' They said: 'No; he walks about alone in the bazaars.' B\u00e2d\u00e2n continued: 'I swear by God that whatever is related about him does not resemble the words of kings. I think he is a prophet, and if his prediction proves true, none of the kings shall fore-stall me in obeying and following him.' Meanwhile a letter addressed to B\u00e2d\u00e2n arrived from Shiruiah,346 the son\n\n346 About Khosru Parviz, Shiruiah, and their reigns, see Part I., vol. ii., of this series, pp. 396-401.\nof Khosru Parviz, of the following import: 'I have slain the Kesra because he has destroyed the nobles and grandees of Persia without being provoked thereto by treachery or guilt, which might have afforded a just reason for shedding their blood, and because he has thrown the stumbling-block of contention into the assembly of the great men of this country. My commands to thee are, to obey me, ordering the inhabitants of Yemen, and of all the provinces under thy sway, to do so likewise, and to receive their [declarations of] allegiance to me; [I also order thee] not to injure the man who claims to be a prophet in Arabia, and concerning whom the [late] Kesra had written a letter to thee, until further orders from me concerning this matter.' As soon as B\u00e2d\u00e2n had perused this document, he uttered the profession of the Faith without the least delay, and with much sincerity, being followed therein by all the inhabitants of Yemen and Persia who had accepted Isl\u00e2m in that country. It is related that Khar-Kharah, to whom his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had presented a belt, was surnamed Dhu-l-mafakhr\u00e2h, the word 'Mafakhr\u00e2h' meaning 'girdle' in the Hemyaritic language, and that name is borne by his descendants even at present.\n\nIn Alexandria when H\u00e2t\u00fbb B. Abu Multa\u2019ah delivered the august letter of his lordship the prophet of God to Maq\u00f4-qush, the governor of that city, he was received with great honours. The governor replied with handsome expressions, placed the letter in an ivory casket, invited H\u00e2t\u00fbb to a private apartment, and examined him about the affairs and circumstances of that prince. When H\u00e2t\u00fbb had explained the angelic character of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014Maq\u00f4-qush said: 'This is the description of the prophet whose advent I\u2019sa [Jesus], the son of Maryam \u2014 u. w. b. \u2014 had predicted. He will hereafter prevail, and his companions will enter our land.' Then he wrote a very friendly reply, and presented H\u00e2t\u00fbb with four girls, one white mule called Dildil, one eunuch, twenty garments, one thousand mithq\u00e2ls of gold, and five robes,\nbut refrained from making his profession of the Faith. When H\u0101ttub arrived in Madinah with the presents of Maq\u014dqush and the letter, his sacred and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014said: \u2018The wicked man was covetous for his realm, but it will not endure.\u2019 It is related that [in conformity with this prediction] Maq\u014dqush died during the Khalifate of F\u0101r\u016bq the Great [i.e., Omar]. As to those four girls, his lordship retained one, whose name was M\u0101ryah the Copt, for himself as a concubine, and begat with her Ebr\u0101h\u012bm. Another maiden, the sister of the former, named Shyryn, he bestowed upon \u1e24asan B. Th\u00e2bet, and placed the brand of selection on Dildil for his own special use, but after the demise of the lord of existences\u2014u. w. b.\u2014A\u2019li\u2014may Allah ennoble his countenance!\u2014used to ride that mule, which [afterwards] perished in the time of Moa\u2019wiah.\n\nWhen Shujaa\u2019 B. Wohb Asdy arrived on the frontiers of Syria he heard that H\u0101reth B. Abu Shammar Ghus\u0101n\u012b was in the Ghautah of Damasus, engaged in the preparations necessary for the pilgrimage of Heraclius to the locality of the prophets; i.e., Jerusalem. Therefore Shujaa\u2019 went to the Ghautah, and forwarded the most noble epistle to [the governor] H\u0101reth, through one of his chamberlains, in whose heart the love for Islam had taken root. When the king [or rather governor] of Syria had perused the letter, he threw it to the ground, uttering disgraceful words to the effect that he would make haste to combat his lordship. He also ordered horses to be shod and despatched a letter to Heraclius, informing him of the arrival of Shujaa\u2019 B. Wohb and of his intention to attack Muhammad. Heraclius, however, sent a reply that he should give up his intention and hasten to the court, for the purpose of taking measures appropriate to the circumstances. Thereon H\u0101reth dismissed Shujaa\u2019 with a gift of one hundred mith-q\u0101ls of gold, and when the latter arrived in Madinah he made his report, to which his lordship replied: \u2018May the kingdom of H\u0101reth perish!\u2019 Therefore H\u0101reth died in the\n\n347 Ghautah is the district around the city.\nyear of the victory of Mekkah, and was succeeded on the throne by Haylah B. Abh\u00e2n Ghus\u00e2ny, whose conversion to Isl\u00e2m will be narrated in the proper place if it pleaseth Allah the Most High.\n\nWhen Salytt B. A\u2019mru A\u2019amery delivered the glorious epistle of his prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014to Haudah B. Hanfy, the latter became acquainted with the contents thereof, showed great honours to Salytt, appointed a pleasant mansion for his lodging, entertained him hospitably, and wrote in reply to the letter as follows: \u2018How beautifully evident is that to which thou invitest the people! I am, however, the poet and the priest of my nation, and the Arabs respect me greatly. Make me a governor of one of thy provinces, and I shall obey thee.\u2019 After that he invested Salytt with costly robes, treated him with royal honours, and dismissed him. When Salytt arrived in Madinah he narrated what he had seen, and delivered the letter, but his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014said: \u2018If he were to ask me for a date which had fallen to the ground I would not give it to him. Let him and his kingdom perish!\u2019 It is related that when the apostle of God conquered Mekkah, and was returning, Jebr\u00e2il brought the death of Haudah to the exalted notice of the lord of apostleship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014who said: \u2018After this a mendicant will make his appearance in Yam\u00e2mah, and will pretend to be a prophet, and will after my time be slain.\u2019 But he had not yet departed this life when Moseylamah, the liar of Yam\u00e2mah, claimed to be a prophet, and was killed during the Khalifate of Ssiddyq Akbar, as shall be narrated in detail in this volume if it pleaseth Allah the Most High.\n\nIn this year also the blessed verse, \u2018Now hath Allah heard the speech of her who disputed with thee concerning her husband, and made her complaint unto Allah,\u2019 was revealed; the reason being that between Khawla, the daughter of Tha\u2019labah B. Qays, and between her husband,\n\n348 *I.e.*, Abu Bakr, the immediate successor of the prophet.\n349 Qur\u00e2n, ch. lviii. begins with the above words.\nAwus B. Ssamat, divorce had taken place, and that when she asked his lordship, 'What is the remedy for this pain?' he could give no reply, because he had not yet received any Divine command on the subject. She therefore prostrated herself in her great distress, and prayed as follows: 'My God, I complain to Thee of my loneliness, desolation, and separation from my husband.' But she had not yet raised her head from the prostration when the verses concerning the formula of divorce\\(^{350}\\) were revealed. His holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014then called Awus, recited to him the verses just revealed, and said: 'Manumit a slave, and then have connection with Khawla.' Awus replied: 'I am too poor to liberate a slave.' His lordship thereon said: 'Fast two continuous months.' When, however, Awus again demurred, saying: 'O apostle of God, if I do not eat twice or thrice a day, my eyes become obscured,' the prophet rejoined: 'Then feed sixty poor men.' Awus said: 'Aid me in this matter.' His lordship accordingly presented him with fifteen Saa' [measures] of food to enable him to atone for the words, 'Thou art to me as the back of my mother,' which he had said to his wife. During this year his holy and prophetic lordship also gave permission to hold races between camels and horses. It is said that his lordship possessed a camel, named Ghadzabna, which no other camel was able to overtake; one day, however, an Arab [of the desert] made his weak camel race with the she-camel of the apostle of God, and overtook Ghadzabna, which occurrence displeased the companions; but his lordship, the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014endeavoured to pacify them, saying: 'The truth is with Allah! He exalts nothing which he does not abase.' One of the consequences of this axiom and confirmation of those circumstances was the misfortune of the inhabitants of Khayber, who [at last] obtained tranquillity after all their trouble.\n\n\\(^{350}\\) The form in use among the Arabs in the time of ignorance was: 'Thou art [henceforth] to me as the back of my mother.'\nThe Victory of Khayber.\n\nOne of the great events of this year was the victory of Khayber, the details whereof are as follows: When his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014returned from Hodaybiah he ordered, after a stay of some days in Madinah, the chiefs of the Moh\u00e2jer and the Anss\u00e2r to get the army ready for a campaign in the direction of Khayber, and added: 'No one shall march out with me except to fight for the religion.' He meant by those words: 'Let no one accompany me who covets the goods of this world, and whose whole mind is bent on pillage.' Therefore the hypocrites and infidels who dwelt in Madinah were greatly displeased with his lordship's intention to march to Khayber, because they knew that the professors of Isl\u00e2m would deal with the Jews of Khayber in the same manner as they had dealt with the Bani Qoryttah and the Bani An-natzyr Jews; and on account of the rage they were in, every Jew took a heavy pledge from any Musalm\u00e2n who happened to be indebted to him. It is related that A'bdullah B. Abu Hadhra Solmy owed five dirhems to Abu Sh\u00e2hm, the Jew, and that the latter troubled him much for this paltry sum. Once A'bdullah said to him: 'God the Most High and Glorious has promised that the professors of Isl\u00e2m will obtain possession of the property of the inhabitants of Khayber, respite me, [therefore], in this matter for a short time, until the victory of Khayber takes place and I gain some booty.' Abu Shahm replied: 'Do not compare the war of the Khayber Jews with other campaigns! By the truth of the Torathah, there are ten thousand men in Khayber! Threatenest thou us with the vengeance of an enemy whilst thou art thyself living under our protection?' A'bdullah says: 'We quarrelled so much that I went to the lord of apostleship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014to whom I represented my case. His lordship said nothing to the Jew, but moved his blessed lips, and muttered something which I could not understand. Thereon the Jew exclaimed: \"O father of Q\u00e2sim, this man has taken what\nbelongs to me, and keeps it.\u201d His lordship said: \u201cGive him his due.\u201d A\u2019bdullah continues: \u2018I had two robes, and I sold one of them for three dirhems, to which I added two more and paid my debt to the Jew. Then Solmah B. Aslam presented me with two robes, to which I added two more and departed to Khayber. In that campaign Allah the Most High and Glorious blessed me with many favours, and by Divine grace one of the captured women, who was a relative of Abu Shahm, fell to my lot, and when we returned to Mekkah I sold her to him at her full price.\u2019\n\nIn fine, after the preparations for the Ghaz\u00e0 had been completed, the apostle of God appointed Asbaa\u2019 B. A\u2019rfattah Ghuff\u00e1ry to be his lieutenant in Madinah, and marched with one thousand four hundred valiant slayers of infidels from the residence of nobility and excellence. He ordered A\u2019k\u00e1shah Asdy to take charge of the vanguard, and O\u2019mar B. Alkhatt\u00e1b of the right wing. Some of the best writers of later times allege that another companion, but several biographers relate that A\u2019li, the commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014was entrusted with the left wing. This statement is however unfounded, because, according to correct traditions, A\u2019li Mortadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014was not present with the army in the beginning, and when he joined it his lordship the apostle gave the banner into his hands, by which the victory was gained, as shall be narrated farther on if it pleaseth Allah the Most High.\n\nIt is related that A\u2019bdullah B. Sal\u00fal, the hypocrite, sent the following message to the Jews of Khayber: \u2018Muhammad intends to extirpate you, therefore you must use foresight. You are not to fortify yourself in a stronghold, but you must fight him in the plain, because you surpass him in the greatness of your numbers and appliances.\u2019 When the inhabitants of Khayber knew that his lordship, the best of men, was marching against them, they sent Kun\u00e1nah B. Abu-l-haqyq with another man to their allies\u2014i.e., to the tribe Ghuttf\u00e1n\u2014for aid. According to one tradition the latter would not at all comply with the request of the Khayberites, but according to another four\nthousand combatants of that tribe sallied out; as, however, they heard at the first station a voice from heaven uttering the words, 'You will be plundered,' they again returned. In other books it is recorded that they heard a sound and movement in their rear, and imagined that the Musalm\u00e2ns had entered their habitations to plunder them, therefore they became frightened and retraced their steps. This, however, was a miracle of the miracles of the apostle\u2014u. w. b. At that time their governor was Soll\u00e2m B. Sakan, in whose house the chiefs of the Jews assembled, and consulted whether it would be better to march out and fight or to defend themselves in their forts. Soll\u00e2m exclaimed: 'A'bdullah B. Sal\u00fbl's advice is best. March out, and do not expose yourselves to the miseries of a siege.' But according to the proverb, 'When fate decides, human reason is blind,' their eyes of foresight became obscured, so that they refused to act according to the advice of Soll\u00e2m, remained in their forts, strengthening them, and preparing themselves for enduring a siege. Solmah B. Al\u00e2kwa' says: 'When we marched out of Madinah in the august retinue of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and advanced towards Khayber, one A'amer B. Las\u00e2n B. Alakwa' recited during the night march some verses in the Rajaz measure at the request of a companion, so that the camels progressed with great celerity, and the time of the companions passed pleasantly. His lordship the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014then asked, \"Who is the driver?\" and the people replied, \"Such and such a man.\" He continued, \"May Allah have mercy upon him!\" and concerning whomsoever his lordship uttered this invocation he was sure to attain martyrdom. F\u00e2r\u00fbq, who happened to hear the above words, said: \"O apostle of God! why hast thou not prayed that A'amer may attain a long life?\" There is a tradition that when A'amer ceased to recite the verses for speeding the camels, his lordship ordered A'bdullah B. Ru\u00e2hah to commence his strains for driving, and with reference to him the prophet [again] uttered the words, 'Allah, have mercy upon him!' He accordingly obtained the dignity of martyrdom in the\nGhaz\u00e2 at Mowtah, as shall be narrated by the reed of explanation if it pleaseth Allah the Most High.\n\nWhen the army of Isl\u00e2m had reached the station of Ssab\u00e2, his lordship\u2014after holding the vesper-time and nocturnal prayers\u2014ordered the army to be led in the direction between Ghuttf\u00e2n and Khayber so as to hinder the Ghuttf\u00e2n tribe to give assistance to the Jews; and with the help of Jamyl, who was an intelligent guide, the Musalm\u00e2ns continued their march by the way of Marjab. The apostle of God despatched A'b\u00e2d B. Bashyr with twenty troopers to reconnoitre, who captured a man whom the inhabitants had sent as a spy. A'b\u00e2d asked him: 'Who art thou?' He replied: 'I am a camel-driver, and am looking for my beasts who have strayed.' He further asked: 'What knowest thou about the Jews of Khayber?' The spy replied: 'They have despatched Kun\u00e4nah B. Abu-l-haqyq and Houdah B. Qays, and Ahly to their sworn confederates, i.e., to the tribe of Ghuttf\u00e2n to ask for help; and their request having been complied with, O'tb\u00e2h B. Bedr has, with a great multitude of valiant men entered the fort of Khayber, so that at present ten thousand warriors consider a social banquet and the battle-field equally attractive, and are waiting for an opportunity to fight Muhammad.' A'b\u00e2d said: 'I fancy thou art a spy of the enemy.' And having administered to him a good whipping to sober down his bravado, he continued: 'Tell the truth, for if thou statest falsehoods thy life will not be spared.' The Arab said: 'Give me quarter and I shall tell thee the truth.' His request having been complied with, he continued: 'The people are under great apprehensions about you, and terror has overpowered their minds lest you should deal with them as you have acted towards the Jews of Yathrab, i.e., the Bani An-natzyr and the Bani Qoryttah. The hypocrites of Madinah have also sent a message to the inhabitants of Khayber as follows: \"Muhammad is marching against you, but be not afraid, and let nothing dismay you. Be firm in fighting and combating him, because your army exceeds his forces greatly,\"\nand his weapons are few and insignificant in comparison with yours.\u201d After this message had been brought by the courier of A\u2019bdullah B. Sal\u00fbl and his followers, Kun\u00e2nah B. Abu-l-haqq sent me to ascertain the number of your army.\u2019 A\u2019b\u00e2d conveyed this spy into the presence of the lord of existences, and made his report. F\u00e2r\u00fbq the greater desired this spy to be killed, but A\u2019b\u00e2d said: \u2018I have granted him quarter.\u2019 Accordingly he surrendered to A\u2019b\u00e2d his spy, who thereon immediately made his profession of the Faith, and was thus delivered from the grasp of death.\n\nWhen his lordship caught sight of Khayber he ordered his companions to halt, and uttered the following words: \u2018O God, Lord of the seven heavens and what is around them, and Lord of the seven earths and what is upon them, and Lord of the Satans and of those whom they seduce, I ask Thee for the welfare of this town and for the good which is therein, and I take refuge with Thee from its evil, and from the evil which is therein.\u2019 It was his habit to utter these words with his wonderfully eloquent tongue at the sight of strong localities; and after announcing them, he turned\u2014according to a certain tradition\u2014his blessed countenance to the companions, saying: \u2018Enter ye, with the blessing of Allah!\u2019 And\u2014according to another tradition\u2014he exclaimed: \u2018Approach, in the name of Allah!\u2019 The victory-portending army therefore advanced by order of the apostle of God\u2014to whom be greeting and peace\u2014and after performing the distance his lordship halted in a place called Manzalah, and pointed out a spot to hold prayers in.\n\nIt is related that when the inhabitants of Khayber heard of the approach of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014they manifested great watchfulness, and kept mounted warriors day and night on the look-out in the environs. The very night, however, when his lordship arrived God the Most High and Glorious sent a heavy sleep upon the people of Khayber, so that they never awoke until the cocks began to crow, so that even their beasts remained\nkept indoors. Near sunrise, however, the Jews awoke from their sleep, taking up baskets and spades in a sad mood and depressed spirits, and going out with the intention to work in their fields. When, however, they perceived the army of Isl\u00e2m from a distance, they returned and said: 'By Allah, this is Muhammad!' When his holy and prophetic lordship perceived them, he exclaimed: 'God is greatest! I shall ruin Khayber,' etc. The Jews then took refuge in their fort, and when the news of the advent of the army had been communicated to Soll\u00e2m B. Mashkam, he said to the people: 'If you have not taken my advice in the beginning, do your best, at any rate, in the present emergency, and fight, because to be killed in war is a thousand times better than to groan in captivity.' The Jews accordingly resolved to fight. They collected their property of various kinds, and kept it in the fort Naa'm, which was a great stronghold, and the valiant combatants assembled in the fortress Natz\u00e2rah, where, however, Soll\u00e2m departed to hell before it was conquered.\n\nHis holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014encouraged his companions to fight, and promised them the reward of the next world. He also said: 'If you persevere you will conquer.' The army of Isl\u00e2m then commenced the battle by shooting arrows. On that day, which was very hot, Mahm\u00fbd B. Moslamah, brother of Muhammad B. Moslamah, fought long, and being exhausted also by the heat, fell asleep in the shade of Fort Naa'm, imagining that the enemy could not perceive him. But, according to two different traditions, either Kun\u00e2nah B. Abu-l-haqyq or Marahab the Jew threw a stone at him from the top of the fort. The stone struck his head, and although it broke to pieces, so injured the man that the skin of his forehead hung over his face. The professors of Isl\u00e2m bore him in this condition to the apostle of God, who replaced the skin on the forehead with his own blessed hands, and bandaged his head with sackcloth; but on account of that wound, Mahm\u00fbd nevertheless departed to the gardens of paradise.\nOn that day Hab\u00e2b B. Almundhar represented to his lordship that the camp of the army, being exposed to the arrows from the fort, was in an unsuitable locality; further, that it was in a date-grove, on an unhealthy spot, and exposed to the sorties of the enemy. His advice having been accepted, Muhammad B. Moslamah was ordered to select a proper locality. He accordingly examined the environs, and found the place Rajya' to be a locality fit for the camp. His holy and prophetic lordship having approved of the spot, said: 'We shall go there to-night.' Accordingly he went there with his companions after sunset, and appointed O'thm\u00e2n B. O'ff\u00e2n to attend to the pitching and the arrangements of the camp, from which the Musalm\u00e2ns then sallied forth day by day to attack the stronghold.\n\nIt is related that one night, when O'mar B. Alkhatt\u00e2b was on guard over the army of Isl\u00e2m, a Jew was captured and brought to him. He ordered him to be killed; but the man said: 'Take me to your prophet, because I have something to tell him.' O'mar complied with the request, and his lordship asked: 'What hast thou to say?' The Jew said: 'I came from the fort of Natz\u00e2rah, the garrison whereof is extremely distressed to-day, on account of the fierceness of the battle, and dreads the bravery of the champions of this army. This evening they intend to remove to the fort Shaq. They have concealed their provisions and appliances of war in a place known to me, and I can point it out to-morrow when the fort is conquered.' His lordship said: 'If it pleaseth Allah the Most High.' The Jew continued: 'My wife and family are in the fort; grant them to me.' The apostle of God said: 'I shall do so.' The following day Natz\u00e2rah was conquered, and Fort Shaq likewise, whereon the said Jew, with his adherents, made profession of the Faith.\n\nIt is related that one day the Musalm\u00e2ns were engaged in attacking and besieging the fort of Ssa'b, when the Jew Marahab sallied out, and, capering into the lists of championship, encountered A'amer \u2014 with reference to whom his lordship had uttered an invocation for mercy on\nthe occasion when he was reciting verses to speed the camels\u2014whose head he struck with his sabre. A\u2019amer aimed a blow at Marahab, but accidentally wounded his own knee, and died from that wound.\n\nWhen marching back from Khayber his holy and prophetic lordship observed during the journey that Solmah Bin Alakwa\u2019, the cousin of A\u2019amer, manifested signs of distress and melancholy, and asked him for the reason thereof. According to one tradition, Solmah B. Alakwa\u2019 came weeping to his lordship, and said: \u2018O apostle of God, some of thy companions are telling me that the [good] works of A\u2019amer are useless, because he has perished by his own sword.\u2019 But his lordship, uniting [the tips] of his fingers [and holding them up], said: \u2018Verily he has fought for the religion.\u2019 It is related that during the siege of Khayber the Musalm\u00e2ns suffered from want of provisions, but that one day twenty sheep had come from the fort of Ssa\u2019b, and were browsing in the vicinity, whereon his lordship exclaimed: \u2018Is there anyone who can take one of these sheep to feed us?\u2019 Accordingly Abu-l-yasyr B. A\u2019mru the Anss\u00e2ri stepped forward, saying: \u2018O prophet of God, I shall go on that service.\u2019 Then he gathered up his skirts, and when the apostle of God saw him running like a fawn, he said: \u2018O God, cause him to provide for us.\u2019 When Abu-l-yasyr arrived with two sheep, which he had taken under his two arms, his lordship the refuge of termination ordered them to be slaughtered and prepared for a repast; nor was there a man in the camp who did not partake thereof. By the life-preserving benediction of his lordship the best of men\u2014u. w. b.\u2014Abu-l-yasyr lived for many years, doing much good to the pious and the righteous\u2014A. h. m. o. h.\n\nIt is related that during the siege of the fort of Ssa\u2019b a number of Musalm\u00e2ns had become very weak from want of food, and were on the brink of starvation. They complained to him who will be the intercessor on the day of resurrection, and requested him to pray that their want might be changed to plenty, and their misery to comfort.\nHis lordship accordingly addressed a petition to the Courts of Monotheism that the fort containing the greatest quantity of provisions be allowed to fall into the possession of the Musalm\u00e2ns. He then gave the banner to Hab\u00e2b B. Almu\u00eendhar, and ordered the victory-boding army to make a unanimous onslaught. The company which had complained of famine was the first to reach the gate of Fort Ssa\u2019b, and to fight till it had been conquered. The Musalm\u00e2ns obtained possession of great quantities of clothes with property of all kinds, which they brought out of the fort, as well as of much wine; but, by Divine command, they poured it all on the ground. One Musalm\u00e2n, however, A\u2019bdullah B. Kum\u00e2r by name, being very fond of wine, had taken several draughts thereof. This culprit was accordingly taken by the companions to the apostle of God, and the august mind of that legislator was highly displeased with the act of the transgressor, whom he chastised with his own august shoe, and by order of the apostle of men and demons all who were present in the assembly likewise struck A\u2019bdullah with their sandals, and among the companions O\u2019mar exclaimed: \u2018By Allah! curse him, that all of us may not be punished for his transgression.\u2019 But his holy and prophetic lordship replied: \u2018O\u2019mar, do not say that, for he loves Allah, and His apostle.\u2019\n\nConquest of the Fort Qum\u00fbss, and of all the Strongholds, by the Prowess of A\u2019li the Commander of the Faithful.\n\nWhen the army of the professors of Isl\u00e2m was engaged in beleaguering the fort of Qum\u00fbss, his holy and prophetic lordship was suffering from headache, and could therefore not be present in the fights, but gave every day audience\u2014in conformity with the inspirations of his luminous mind and the dictates of his sunlike intellect\u2014to the Moh\u00e2jer and Anss\u00e2r nobles, handing the victorious standard to one\nof the companions, and sending him to the battle. As the just-mentioned fortress was extremely strong and well protected, it could not be taken. Therefore F\u0101riq the greater, having one day received the banner, advanced with a number of the defenders of the glory of Isl\u00e2m to the base of the fort of the benighted idolaters; but the reflection of victory failed, despite his great efforts, to manifest itself on the speculum of his mind. The next day Ssiddyq the greater took the standard, and hastened with a number of warriors and heroes to fight the professors of aberration. Both parties fought obstinately: he was, however, doomed to return unsuccessfully. The third time O'mar B. Alk-hatt\u0101b again attacked the garrison of Qum\u00fbss with great impetuosity, but was disappointed; and when the [sun] the sovereign of luminaries advanced with his golden banner to subdue the regions of the west, the prince of Batth\u0101 and Yathrab [i.e., of Mekkah and Madinah] uttered with his pearl-dropping and miracle-working lips the following words: 'To-morrow I shall give the standard to no one but to the hero of attack who never flees, who loves God and the apostle, and whom God and the apostle love. Allah will give us the victory through him.'\n\nIt is said that A'li\u2014may Allah ennoble his countenance!\u2014was in the beginning of this Ghaz\u00e2 prevented from taking part therein by ophthalmia, and had remained in Madinah; but his luminous mind could not bear to be separated from his lordship, and therefore he went, in spite of his malady, to kiss the head of the apostle of God, whom he met on the road, but according to another tradition after his arrival in Khayber.\n\nSahal B. Sa'd Saa'dy says that during that night, when the lord of apostleship had uttered the above-mentioned words, a discussion took place among the companions to which of them he would give the standard [of command]. Burydah Alhassyb narrates that everyone who was related to the apostle imagined he would obtain the banner; and the Qoraish thought that the person alluded to [in the above words] would not be A'li E. Abu Tt\u00e2leb, because his eyes were\nso affected that he could not see his own footsteps. When, however, the ears of the Commander of the Faithful were loaded with the bright pearls of the words of his lordship the prince of the righteous, he said: 'O God, no one can take what Thou refusest to give, and no one can refuse to accept what Thou choosest to bestow.' Next day, when the eyes of mankind were brightened by the light of the world-illuminating sun, the lucky mortals who were able to clench the sides of tigers in the fire of battle, and to place in the height of the fight their hands into the throats of whales, made their appearance at the holy tent-door of his lordship the refuge of apostleship, and every one thought that this great felicity and excellent gift would fall to his own lot. Sa'id B. Woqqass says: 'I knelt down opposite to the apostle of Allah, and then rose, hoping to obtain the flag.' It is related of F\u00e2r\u00fbq the greater that he said: 'I never wished to be commander except on that day.' When his lordship the Mussttafa\u2014u. w. b.\u2014came out of the tent, he asked, 'Where is A'li E. Abu Tt\u00e2leb?' and on all sides vociferations arose to the effect of his eyes being sore, and that he could not distinguish his own feet. He, however, commanded: 'Bring him here.' Accordingly A'li was produced, whereon his lordship placed his head upon his own blessed thigh, and threw a little saliva from his blessed mouth into the eyes of A'li. According to another tradition, however, he first poured the saliva on his own hand, then smeared it on A'li's eyes, and said: 'O God, protect him from heat and cold.' A'li Mortadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014says: 'By the blessing of the apostle of God, after that I no longer felt either cold or hot.' Ebn Abu Layly says: 'During the greatest heat A'li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014used to wear a robe stuffed with cotton, experiencing no inconvenience; and during the most inclement weather a thin garment, without the least injury.' It is related that A'li, having been immediately relieved of his ophthalmia [by the above operation], the prophet handed him the flag, saying: 'Do not look at it until God the Most High and Glorious causes thee to conquer Khayber.' After A'li had advanced a short dis-\ntance he shouted: 'O apostle of God, how shall I fight them?' His lordship the prophet replied: 'Fight them till they bear witness that there is no God but Allah, and that Muhammad is the apostle of Allah. If they do that, they and everything they possess will be safe, and their account will be with God.' According to another tradition, A'li the Commander of the Faithful said, when he had received the banner and proceeded a short way: 'O apostle of God, shall I fight them until they become [Musalm\u00e2ns] like ourselves?' His lordship replied: 'O A'li, do not be in haste to fight, but march till thou arrivest in their midst, and then invite them to accept Isl\u00e2m, and inform them of the duties imposed upon them by the Almighty; and I swear by God that if a single individual obtains [Divine] guidance from Allah the Most High through thy instrumentality, it will be of more advantage to thee than the red-haired camels which thou givest as alms for the sake of God the Most High and Glorious!'\n\nSome allege that the apostle of God dressed A'li Mortadza in his own cuirass, girded him with the Dhu-l-fiq\u00e2r, and handed to him the victorious standard. A'li started, and when he arrived in the vicinity of the fort of Qum\u00fbss he erected his banner on a hillock of stones. A Jewish priest then appeared on the rampart, and asked: 'Possessor of the standard, who art thou, and what is thy name?' The lion of attack replied: 'I am A'li, the son of Abu Tt\u00e2leb.' The Jew thereon turned to his own people, and said: 'I swear by the Pentateuch that you will be conquered!'\n\nIt is related in biographical works that the first men who came out from the stronghold with a legion of assailants was H\u00e2reth the Jew, brother of Maharrab.\\(^{351}\\) He attacked the Musalm\u00e2ns, and caused some of them to attain martyrdom; A'li the Commander of the Faithful, however, approached H\u00e2reth, and sent him to hell with one blow of his scimitar. When Maharrab became aware that his brother had been slain, he put on his armour and sallied forth with a number of men to avenge his death. Maharrab\n\n\\(^{351}\\) Marhab': Reinaud, 'Notice sur Mahomet,' 1860, p. 30.\nwas a tall and corpulent warrior, the point of whose spear weighed three *Manns*, and none of the combatants of Khayber equalled him in bravery. He wore two cuirasses, and was girded with two swords; he had also two turbans on his head, with a helmet over them. He entered the lists and declaimed Rajaz poetry commencing with the words, 'Verily the people of Khayber know that I am Marhab!' [sic]. As none of the Musalm\u00e1ns would cope with him in a duel, A\u2019li, the son of Abu Tt\u00e1l\u00e9b, who was the sovereign of men and lion of God, approached him, uttering with his blessed tongue the Rajaz verse, 'I am he whom his mother has surnamed the lion!' Hereon Marhab desired to strike A\u2019li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014with his sword; but the Amir forestalled him, and inflicted with his Dhu-l-fiq\u00e1r such a blow on the head of that ill-fated wretch that it penetrated through the turbans and helmet to his teeth, and some historians relate that it went down to the knob of the saddle. After that the Commander and the commanded set about exterminating the Jews, whereon seven of the principal and most valiant Khayberites fell by the scimitar of the model of saints, the remnant of the Jews retreating to the fort, and A\u2019li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014pursuing them. On that occasion one of the enemies struck the Commander of the Faithful with something, so that his buckler fell down and was snatched up by one of the fugitives. A\u2019li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014became so enraged at this mishap that he went to the fort of Qum\u00fbss and used the iron door thereof in lieu of a shield. It is related of the Commander of the Faithful that he said: \u2018I plucked up the door of Khayber by spiritual, and not by physical, power.\u2019 There is a tradition of the Em\u00e2m Muhammad B\u00e1ker\u2014u. w. b.\u2014to the effect that when A\u2019li\u2014may God ennoble his countenance!\u2014took up the door of the fort and shook it the whole fort quaked therewith in such a manner that Ssofyah, the daughter of Hay, was precipitated to the ground from the top of a couch, and her face was wounded. When the lord and refuge of commandership\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had ceased fighting, he projected\nthe door to a distance of eighty spans over his back, and though seven men of the army of Isl\u00e2m tried hard, and made a united effort to turn the door from one side to the other, they were unable to succeed. In some biographical works it is related that the weight of the door of Khayber amounted to six hundred Manns, whilst some allege that it weighed three thousand Manns. They also say that seventy people were unable to lift it up; but the [true] knowledge is with Allah!\n\nIn short, when the garrison of the fort of Qum\u00fbss and the people of the strongholds of all the Khayberites beheld Hayder [i.e., lion] the Commander of the Believers performing such a wonderful feat, they sued for quarter, which A\u2019li E. Abu Tt\u00e1eb granted them, with the permission of the lord of apostleship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014on condition that every man should be allowed to take a camel with some food, and thus to emigrate from that country, abandoning all the money, arms, and property to the professors of Isl\u00e2m, without concealing anything, and that, if any article they desired to conceal should be discovered, they would be deprived of quarter in the same way as they had been deprived of [Divine grace to profess] the Faith.\n\nWhen the news of this victory reached the august hearing of his lordship the apostle, he was glad and rejoiced much; and when A\u2019li desired to wait upon him, he advanced several steps from his tent to meet him, embraced him, kissed both his eyes, and said: \u2018I am informed of thy laudable efforts and valiant deeds. Allah is pleased with thee, and I am pleased with thee.\u2019 According to another tradition, he said: \u2018I am pleased with thee.\u2019 The Amir was moved to tears by these words, whereon his lordship asked: \u2018Are these tears of joy or of grief?\u2019 He replied: \u2018I weep for joy; and how should I not be pleased when thou art satisfied with me?\u2019 The apostle of God said: \u2018Not only I, but also God the Most High and Glorious, as well as the angels Jebr\u00e2\u00eel and Myk\u00e2yl, are pleased with thee.\u2019\n\nIt is related that in the fort of Qum\u00fbss, the governor\nwhereof was Kun\u0101nah B. Abu-l-haqq, one hundred cuirasses, four hundred swords, and one thousand arrows, and five hundred bows were found. Much furniture, other property, and victuals were also collected, and the fifth portion was set aside [according to the usual custom]. It is said that when the fort of Natz\u0101rah was conquered, Kun\u0101nah had, on account of the fear which he entertained of the Moslems, concealed a camel-hide full of gold and ornaments\u2014received as inheritance\u2014in a certain spot in the desert under ground. It being known to his lordship that the inhabitants of Mekkah were accustomed on festive occasions and marriages to borrow money and trinkets from the Jews and to send them pledges, he entered the fort of Qum\u016bss as soon as it had been conquered, and asked Kun\u0101nah in what place his treasures were. The latter, however, with his adherents, replied: \u2018O father of Q\u0101sim, they have been spent in our preparations for the war, and in supplying our daily wants, so that none remain.\u2019 The apostle of God rejoined: \u2018If the contrary of what you say is found to be the case, shall it be licit to shed your blood by withdrawing the [guaranteed] quarter?\u2019 They said: \u2018Yes.\u2019 Accordingly his holy and prophetic lordship took Ssiddyq, F\u0101r\u016bq, A\u2019li\u2014Allah reward them\u2014and also a number of Jews as witnesses in this matter. On that occasion one of the Jews of Khayber said to Kun\u0101nah: \u2018If that for which Muhammad asks is with thee, or if thou knowest where it is, inform him of it; or else I swear by God that the Most High and Glorious will give him notice thereof and will put thee to shame.\u2019 Kun\u0101nah, however, angrily reproved the Jew, and took no warning from his words. Afterwards God revealed the spot of the treasure to His apostle, who then summoned Kun\u0101nah, and said: \u2018I have learnt by Divine inspiration that thou art a liar.\u2019 Some historians relate that his holy and prophetic lordship asked Tha\u2019labah, the son of Soll\u0101m Abu-l-haqq: \u2018Knowest thou anything about that treasure?\u2019 He replied: \u2018I know nothing, but I have often seen Kun\u0101nah roaming about such and such a place in the\ndesert, and possibly the treasure thou art in search of may be buried there.' Accordingly his lordship the asylum of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014despatched Zobeyr with a number of Musalmans, in conformity with the maxim, 'Who seeketh findeth,' to search for the treasure. When they had discovered it the Jew forfeited his life in consequence of the above-mentioned condition. Therefore his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014surrendered Kun\u0101nah to Muhammad B. Moslamah, who slew him in retaliation for his own brother. All the women of the Jews were taken with the property, but their lives were spared, and the professors of Isl\u0101m obtained possession of goods and cattle to an incalculable extent, which had belonged to the Khayberites. Ssofyah, the wife of Kun\u0101nah, fell to the share of Dahyah Kalby, to whom his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014gave something handsome in return for her. After that he manumitted and wedded her. It is related that before the conquest of Khayber, Ssofyah had dreamt that the moon had fallen into her lap. When she told this to her husband Kun\u0101nah, he replied: 'Thou desirest to become the wife of this king who has encamped in our land.' Thereon he struck her so that blue marks appeared under her eyes, which had not yet disappeared when her wedding was consummated, and when his lordship questioned her about them she gave him the above account of the matter.\n\nWhen the fort of Khayber was conquered, Zaynab\u2014daughter of the Jew H\u00e1reth, and relict of Soll\u0101m, the cousin of Marhab\u2014who knew that the apostle of God was fond of the shoulder and legs of kids, slaughtered one, but mixed poison with those parts which she prepared and sent in the evening by way of a present to his lordship the apostle, who then said to his friends: 'Come, let us sup together.' Accordingly the kid was carved, and when the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014took a piece of meat, and began to masticate it, he exclaimed to his companions: 'Do not eat the kid, because its foreleg says to me: \"I have been defiled with poison!\"' Bashar B. Abar\u0101, who had eaten a\nmorsel of it, then said: 'O apostle of God, while I was chewing it I felt disgust and aversion, but I was unwilling to spit it out, lest I might displease thee.' And before Bashar rose from the meal his complexion changed to black, and after lingering in bad health for one year he departed this life, but according to another tradition he died immediately. The apostle of God then ordered Zaynab and the chiefs of the Jews to be produced, and when they arrived, he asked: 'Will you tell me the truth if I question you?' They replied: 'Yes.' Then he asked: 'Who was your ancestor?' They answered: 'Such and such a man.' He rejoined: 'You lie; for your ancestor was so and so.' When the Jews confessed that he had spoken the truth, his lordship continued: 'Have you put any poison into this kid?' Zaynab replied: 'Yes; I have done it.' His lordship asked: 'What was the reason for such a proceeding?' Zaynab replied: 'Thou hast killed my father, my uncle and my husband. I therefore said to myself: \"If thy claim to prophecy be false, the people will be delivered of thee; and if it be true God the Most High and Glorious will inform thee of this matter, and no harm will befall thee.\"' Some allege that the apostle of God pardoned Zaynab, but others state that he killed her and afterwards ordered her to be crucified. The author of the *Raudzatu-l-\u00e1hb\u00e1b* also relates that Bashar was sick one year and then died, as well as that there are two traditions concerning Zaynab, according to one of which the prophet forgave, and according to the other he slew her, ordering her afterwards to be crucified. Some U\u2019lam\u0101 give credit to the narrative that she was forgiven, and others that she was killed. Others, again, endeavour to reconcile the two traditions by asserting that the prophet did not kill her for his own sake, as his lordship\u2019s custom was never to avenge his personal wrongs on anyone, but that as Bashar B. Abar\u00e2 died by her act, he had her slain; and this is also the opinion of the author of the *Raudzatu-l-\u00e1hb\u00e1b*.\n\nIt is related that fifteen Musalm\u00e2ns perished in the siege of Khayber, and that ninety-three Jews departed to hell.\nThe prophet spared the lives of all the other Jews, but ordered them to emigrate. The inhabitants of Khayber represented, however, with tears and lamentations, that the professors of Isl\u00e1m would stand in need of men for the cultivation of their gardens and fields. They then offered to work as hirelings in the just-mentioned pursuits without meddling at all with the government. His holy and prophetic lordship accordingly took pity on them, and ordered them to cultivate the fields and vineyards of that region on condition of paying one-half of the proceeds thereof into the public treasury, and retaining the other half for their wages.\n\nChroniclers of biographies and of traditions relate that at the time of the victory of Khayber, Hajj\u00e1j B. Khul\u00e1ss Solmy, who was noted for his large property and great wealth, arrived from his tribe for commercial purposes, and had the honour of waiting upon his lordship the apostle; and the padlock of carelessness, fixed on the aperture of the casket of his heart, having been opened with the key of [Divine] guidance, he made his profession of the Faith. Having been received among the adherents of the prophet, he spoke as follows: \u2018I have a great deal of property among the Mekkans, and with my wife Shaybah. If they become aware of my having professed Isl\u00e1m, I shall not be able to get one farthing from them. I therefore crave permission quickly to depart to that country, and to be allowed to say what I like, so as to be enabled to collect my outstandings by hook and by crook.\u2019 The prophet granted his request, and exclaimed: \u2018Say whatever thou listest.\u2019 Hajj\u00e1j says: \u2018When I departed from Khayber, and, after traversing the distance, arrived in Radzyah Baydz\u00e1, I encountered a number of the Qoraish, who made inquiries concerning the affairs of the apostle of God, and when they perceived me they exclaimed: \u201cLo, Hajj\u00e1j has come!\u201d Turning to me, they asked: \u201cWe have heard that yonder brigand went to Khayber. Hast thou any news about him?\u201d I replied: \u201cI possess tidings full of joy and gladness for you.\u201d They continued: \u201cWhat are they?\u201d I\nsaid: \"Muhammad and his companions have suffered a grievous defeat, so that some of his friends were killed and some captured. Muhammad himself is a prisoner, and the inhabitants of Khayber have said, 'We must not kill him here, but must convey him to Mekkah, so that we and the Qoraish may there retaliate upon him for our slain comrades.' I have therefore quickly come to the sanctuary to bring you this piece of information, to collect my property, and again to depart to Khayber, in order to forestall the merchants of this place, who will also go there to purchase the nice clothes and goods of the companions of Muhammad which have fallen into the possession of the inhabitants of Khayber. I shall make purchases and rejoice at the profits I will get.\" Hajj\u00e2j continues: 'When those men had heard what I said, they went to Mekkah, shouting: \"O family of Gh\u00e2leb, Muhammad has been humbled and captured. He is to be brought to Mekkah to suffer death, that we may be consoled.\" It is related that after this rumour had spread, Hajj\u00e2j requested the idolaters to aid him in the collection of his outstandings among the people. The Qoraish were so glad that they complied with his request, and he recovered all that was due to him and had been scattered among the people, as well as the property that was with his wife. It is related that when the Musalm\u00e2ns of Mekkah heard this news they crouched down on the sackcloth of mourning, becoming depressed, sad, and miserable. In fact, they were amazed and confounded, and A\u2019bb\u00e2s B. A\u2019bd-ul-Muttalleb was totally unable to move; but for fear the enemies might become aware of his distress, he ordered the door of his mansion to be left open, and induced Fatham, who was noted for his beautiful voice, to declaim Rajaz poetry aloud, so that any Musalm\u00e2ns happening to pass by, and hearing this voice, made haste to wait on A\u2019bb\u00e2s and to assemble around him. When they had seen him quite joyous and pleased, their minds were comforted. At the same time A\u2019bb\u00e2s despatched one of his slaves to Hajj\u00e2j with the following question: 'What dreadful news is being bandied about as brought by thee? No\ndoubt the promise of the Most High and Glorious is more valid than thy assertions.' Hajj\u00e2j said to the slave: 'Convey my salutations to A'bb\u00e2s, and tell him that affairs are progressing in conformity with the wishes of his friends. Tell him also that I shall pay him a visit at noon, and bring him news that will rejoice him; but it will be necessary to clear his house of friends as well of strangers, because the secret I have to communicate to him is not to be overheard by anyone.' As a reward for this good news, A'bb\u00e2s manumitted the slave and made a vow to manumit ten more, for the purpose of seeking thereby to approach the Lord of Glory. Hajj\u00e2j went, according to his promise, to the house of A'bb\u00e2s, and having informed him of his own profession of Isl\u00e2m, as well as about the Jews at Khayber, continued: 'I have spread that dismal news by the permission of the lord of apostleship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014that I may recover my property.' It is related that first of all Hajj\u00e2j caused A'bb\u00e2s to swear an oath to keep the news secret till three days had elapsed after his departure, and not to reveal it to anyone. Then Hajj\u00e2j took leave, and started that very night to Madinah. When three days had expired, A'bb\u00e2s donned a fine robe, perfumed himself, and halted at the gate of the dwelling of Hajj\u00e2j, whose wife he informed of the real state of affairs. Then he betook himself to the mosque of the sanctuary, and joyfully walked round it. When the idolaters perceived A'bb\u00e2s in this state they conversed with each other, and were astonished at his alertness. The Qoraish said to him: 'O Abu-l-fadzl,\\(^{352}\\) by this promptitude thou desirest to conceal the fire of grief for Muhammad's defeat which is burning thy heart.' A'bb\u00e2s replied: 'Such is not the case. I swear by God that Muhammad has conquered Khayber, has totally vanquished the clan of Abu-l-haqyq, has plundered the goods of the Jews, and has taken their women and children into captivity. Hajj\u00e2j has deceived you for the purpose of collecting his property.' The Qoraish asked: 'Where hast thou heard these words?' He replied: 'From the same\n\n\\(^{352}\\) Father, i.e., possessor of excellence.\ninformant who has rejoiced you with his news?' These words distressed the infidels, but gladdened the professors of Isl\u00e2m, and five days after the departure of Hajj\u00e2j the victory of Khayber had become generally known. The Qoraish were dismayed and sorry that Hajj\u00e2j had departed unscathed, and inconceivable terror overwhelmed the enemies on account of the victory of Khayber.\n\nThe Peace of Fadak.\n\nWhen his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014arrived near Khayber he despatched Makhysah B. Masu\u2019d to Fadak, which was one of the outermost forts of Khayber, to invite its garrison to surrender, and if they refused to do so to threaten them [with annihilation]. Makhysah executed the order, and the people replied: 'A\u2019mer, Y\u00e2ser, H\u00e2reth, and Sind, the Jews, are stationed in Natz\u00e2rah with ten thousand combatants, and we think Muhammad will not be able to cope with them.' When Makhysah perceived that the people of Fadak were not inclined for peace, he desired to return after a stay of two days. The Jews, however, said: 'Remain till we consult our chiefs and send a number of them with thee to Muhammad, that the carpet of pacification may be spread out, and the foundations of tranquillity may be laid.' Meanwhile, however, those people heard how the garrison of Naa\u2019m had been slain, and they were so frightened thereby that they said to Makhysah: 'Keep secret whatever we have told thee about the inhabitants of Khayber and Muhammad, and we shall give thee all the trinkets of our women.' After he had complied with their request they sent one of their chiefs, called N\u00fbn B. Yusha\u2019, with a number of Jews, to his prophetic lordship to negotiate for peace, which was, according to some, concluded on the understanding that their lives would be spared, but their property confiscated. The majority of biographers have, however, recorded in their writings that peace was granted them after a long parley on condition of surrendering one half of their lands to the apostle of God and keeping the other for themselves.\nThis is the reason why O'mar B. Alkhatt\u00e2b ordered them to emigrate when he became Khalifah, and sent arbitrators to Fadak to estimate the value of one half of the lands belonging to the inhabitants thereof, and afterwards paid five thousand dirhems for them from the public treasury. In the Mostaqadza it is, however, recorded that according to some traditions the lord of prophecy\u2014u. w. b.\u2014despatched A'li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014to Fadak, and the latter concluded peace on condition that the lives of the inhabitants were spared, but that all their property was confiscated for the apostle of God. After that Jebr\u00e2il descended, and said: 'God the Most High orders thee to give thy relatives their due.' The apostle of God asked: 'Who are my relatives, and what is their due?' Jebr\u00e2il continued: 'Fattimah [and her offspring are thy relatives]. Give her the possessions of Fadak; and whatever in Fadak belongs to God and the prophet give that also to her.' Accordingly the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014called Fattimah\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and wrote for her a deed to that effect. After the decease of the apostle of God she went to Abu Bakr, and said: 'This is the document of the apostle of God, which was written for me [and my sons], Hasan and Hosayn.\n\nJa'fer B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb arrives from Abyssinia. The Marriage with Ssofyah is consummated. The Sun returns for A'li Murtadza\u2014u. w. r. The Ghaz\u00e2 of W\u00e2dy-l-qara.\n\nAfter the forts of Khayber had been conquered, Ja'fer B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb\u2014A. r. h.\u2014returned with some companions who had emigrated from Mekkah to Abyssinia, and the prophet said: 'I do not know what rejoices me more, the advent of Ja'fer or the conquest of Khayber.' When his holy and prophetic lordship returned from Khayber he marched to W\u00e2dy-l-qara, and, arriving in the station of Ssahb\u00e2, he consummated his marriage with Ssofyah, whom he asked: \"Why wouldst thou not agree to consummate\nour wedding before we reached this halting-place?' Ssofyah replied: 'The Jews were near, and I feared they might injure thee.' This answer so pleased the august nature of his lordship that he loved her the better for it. In the station of Ssabb\u00e2 the Most High and Glorious Lord\u2014whose name be exalted\u2014turned the sun back to enable A'li to hold his afternoon prayers. This took place as follows: One day his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had placed his blessed head in the lap of A'li the Commander of the Faithful, while the signs of Divine revelation manifested themselves on that prince; the descent, however, of the revelation lingered till the sun had disappeared in the west. After the Divine inspiration had irradiated him the apostle of God asked A'li whether he had performed his afternoon prayers, but received a negative answer. Therefore he prayed, and said: 'O God, A'li was obeying Thee and Thy apostle; cause therefore the sun to return for his sake, to enable him to hold his post-meridian devotions.' It is related of Asm\u00e2, the daughter of O'mys, that she said: 'After the sun had set I saw it rising [again], shining on the plains and mountains, so that the people were eye-witnesses of the brightness of the sunshine, whereon A'li held his prayers, and this was one of the signs of prophecy.' When the Jews of the W\u00e2dy-l-qara obtained information of the approach of the apostle of God they made, with the aid of some idolaters, the necessary preparations for war, marched out of their stations, and drew themselves up in battle array. His lordship also ordered his lines to be formed, handed his flag to one of the principal companions, and invited the opponents to accept Isl\u00e2m, saying: 'Make profession of the Faith! Your lives and property will remain safe, and your account will be with God the Most High and Glorious.' They, however, refused to comply, and began the attack as follows: A man stepped out of their ranks and shouted for a champion; but Zobeyr defaced his countenance with a sharp sword. After that another man was also bold enough to step into the lists of contention, but Zobeyr\ndespatched him to hell in the same manner. Then another hero presented himself, whom A'li met and slew, whilst Abu Dujanah killed two other men, so that ten or eleven of the enemy lost their lives on that day. When the night set in both armies remained stationary in their places till the morning. When the nocturnal hosts [i.e., stars] had been put to flight by the monarch of the day [i.e., the sun], the champions of both parties unsheathed their swords and assailed each other. The sun had attained nearly one spear's height, when the opponents became much afraid and commenced to flee, whereon a great deal of plunder fell into the hands of the professors of Islam, and this was one victory more added to the others. When the Jews heard of the fame of the victorious army they became so frightened that they sued for peace, and agreed to pay tribute.\n\nO'mratu-l-Qadz\u00e2 [Pilgrimage by Divine Predestination].\n\nWhen his holy and prophetic lordship had by the decree of Divine providence victoriously returned from Khayber and from W\u00e2dy-l-qara to Madinah, he sent out forays to the tribes dwelling around Mekkah and Madinah. After that he ordered his friends to prepare themselves for a march to the pilgrimage of Divine predestination, enjoining all the companions who had been present at the peace of Hodaybiah to take part also in this expedition, and not to absent themselves under any pretext whatever. Accordingly, all who were alive complied, and joined the heaven-aspiring retinue; and besides the covenanters of the oath of Radzuw\u00e2n, three hundred men in addition girded up their loins for the above expedition. In short, his lordship appointed Abu Dhar Ghuff\u00e2r\u00ee to be his lieutenant in Madinah, and marched with ten thousand men and one hundred horses of noble breed, with many weapons, such as helmets, cuirasses, swords, and sixty or seventy camels, in the month of Dhu-l-qa'dah, in the seventh\n\n353 Also called 'Pledge of the Tree.' See footnote 333.\n354 To be slaughtered in Mekkah as sacrifices.\nyear after his blessed Flight, with the intention of performing the visitation gladly and joyfully in Mekkah. It is related that the apostle gave the noble steeds in charge of Muhammad B. Moslamah, and the arms to Bashyr B. Sa\u2019d, attaching a number of men to these two blessed individuals and causing them to march in advance. Some said: \u2018O apostle of God, one of the conditions of peace was not to bring any arms to Mekkah, except swords in their scabbards.\u2019 He replied: \u2018We shall not carry these [weapons] to the sanctuary, but we take them as a precaution, in case the people should act contrary to the treaty, and break it.\u2019 When Bashyr B. Sa\u2019d and Muhammad B. Moslamah arrived at Mar\u00e2 Al-tzuhr\u00e2n, the Qoraish who were there saw them and knew that his lordship would arrive after them. They accordingly ran to Mekkah on the wings of speed, and informed the Qoraish of what was taking place. They went to the tops of mountains and sent Mukraz B. Hafass to ask his lordship on the road what was his intention in bringing arms. He, however, received the reply already mentioned above. Mukraz then returned, and conveyed the news to the idolaters to pacify their minds. The apostle of God thereon ordered the camels destined for sacrifice to be stationed at Dhu Towa, and established his arsenal in another place called Battin M\u00e1haj, and after having appointed a detachment to guard it, he mounted his she-camel Qasswy, and the professors of Isl\u00e2m marched in the wake of his lordship the best of men, some walking and some riding with their swords girded; and they entered Mekkah by way of Menah, uttering the customary Talabyah.\\(^{355}\\) His lordship, mounted as he was, entered the mosque of the sanctuary, A\u2019bdullah B. Ru\u00e2hah holding the bridle of the she-camel Qasswy. Then his lordship uttered the Talabyah with his blessed tongue, and touched the black stone with the hooked stick he had in his hand; then, mounted as he was, he circumambulated the Ka\u2019bah, the companions likewise touching\n\n\\(^{355}\\) This consists in shouting, Labyk! [I obey! I await thy commands].\nthe stone with their sticks by order of his lordship, and walking around the Ka'bah. He ordered them to progress swiftly during the three first, and, according to the usual custom, during the four last circumambulations. The reason for celerity during the first three turns was because the idolaters of Mekkah had said: 'People have arrived with Muhammad whom the fever of Yathrab and the insalubrity of Madinah have rendered lazy, weak, powerless, and lean.' When, however, the Qoraish had perceived from the mountain that the professors of Isl\u00e2m were agile, swift, strong, and healthy, they said to each other: 'The fellows whom we imagined to be disabled by the fever of the country of Yathrab are wonderfully healthy and strong.'\n\nIt is related that when his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had terminated the sacred ceremonies, he appointed Ja'fer B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb to sue for the hand of Maym\u00fbnah, the daughter of H\u00e2reth Hallalyah, who was the sister of the wife of A'bb\u00e2s. Maym\u00fbnah having subordinated her own will to that of A'bb\u00e2s B. A'bd-ul-Muttalleb, he gave her in marriage to his lordship. Sa'd B. Masyb relates that when the apostle of God had performed the ceremonies of the visitation [of the sacred spots] he entered the house of the Ka'bah and ordered Ball\u00e2l to mount on the roof, and to proclaim the time of the forenoon prayers. A'kramah B. Abu Jahl, having heard the voice of Ball\u00e2l, said: 'Verily Allah has blessed [my father] Abu-l-hukm\\(^{356}\\) by sparing him from hearing the voice of this slave, and what he is saying;' and every one of the idolaters had something opprobrious to say. Some allege that his lordship had sent a man to the Qoraish to ask permission for entering the house of the Ka'bah; but that they refused, on the pretext of its not having been mentioned in the treaty of peace. Thereon the apostle of God ordered Ball\u00e2l to go on the roof of the Ka'bah, and to invite the people\n\n\\(^{356}\\) Meaning 'the possessor of wisdom,' which was his honourable epithet, whilst his enemies applied to him the insulting one of Abu Jahl, 'father, i.e., possessor of stupidity.'\nto prayers; but during the three days of the sojourn of the professors of Isl\u00e2m in Mekkah, Ball\u00e2l had been only once ordered to do so. After the three stipulated days had elapsed, Sohayl B. A\u2019mru and Hoyttab B. A\u2019bd\u00fb-l-u\u2019zza went on the fourth day to that prince, and said: \u2018The time appointed for thy stay has expired. Depart, therefore, from our country.\u2019 His lordship replied: \u2018How would it be if you were to allow me to celebrate my wedding with Maym\u00fbnah among you, and to give you a banquet?\u2019 They replied: \u2018We have need neither of thee nor of thy food, O Muhammad. We adjure thee by Allah and by our treaty to leave our country.\u2019 Sa\u2019d B. A\u2019b\u00e2dah, who was present, felt aggrieved by the incivility of Sohayl and Hoyttab, saying to the former: \u2018Thou hast lied. Mayest thou have no mother. For this country belongs neither to thee nor to thy father, and we shall not leave it, except by our own good pleasure.\u2019 The apostle of God smiled, quieted Sa\u2019d, ordering at the same time notice of the departure to be given, and prohibiting any of the companions to remain that night in Mekkah. His lordship accordingly started towards Madinah, but left his freed slave, Abu R\u00e2fi\u2019, in the sanctuary, to convey his spouse Maym\u00fbnah after him to Madinah.\n\nIt is related that Omm Omm\u00e2rah, daughter of Hamzah, the prince of martyrs\u2014u. w. b.\u2014was with her mother, Omm Solmah, living in the noble city of Mekkah, her birthplace. The lord A\u2019li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014spoke to his lordship the apostle as follows with reference to her: \u2018Why should we depart and leave the daughter of our uncle Hamzah among the idolaters? We ought to place her in the howdah of Fattimah and take her to Madinah.\u2019 This was done; but when they arrived in Madinah a dispute arose between A\u2019li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and Ja\u2019fer and Zayd B. H\u00e2rethah because each of them desired to be her protector. Zayd B. H\u00e2rethah, who was the executor of Hamzah, said: \u2018She is my cousin,\u2019 because when the Moh\u00e2jer entered into a league brotherhood was established between Hamzah and Zayd. Then Ja\u2019fer said: \u2018Omm Omm\u00e2rah is my uncle\u2019s\ndaughter, and her aunt is in my house.' A'li said: 'She is the daughter of my uncle, and Fattimah, the darling of his lordship, is in my house; and she is the most worthy to take care of Omm Omm\u00e2rah, especially as I am the cause of her having been brought from Mekkah.' The just-named three blessed individuals came to high words, and quarrelled so loudly that they awakened his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014from sleep, and he spoke as follows after he had been apprised of the subject of their contention: 'I shall judge between you;' and considering the position of each of them, he first said to A'li: 'Thou art mine, and I am thine.' To Ja'fer he said: 'Thou resemblest my nation and my nature.' To Zayd he said: 'Thou art our brother and our freed man.' Then he spoke to Ja'fer as follows: 'Thou art the fittest to keep Omm Omm\u00e2rah, because her aunt is in thy house, and an aunt is in the place of a mother.' He added: 'Marry not a woman whose paternal or maternal aunt is already thy wife.' At these words Ja'fer rejoiced so much that he began hopping on one leg round the apostle of God, who asked him for the reason of such a proceeding; whereon Ja'fer replied: 'O apostle of God, a person whom thou hast made glad is cutting these antics!'\n\nIn this year [i.e., the seventh of the Flight] his lordship the refuge of termination sent a letter to Khaylah B. Abham, who was the last of the Ghus\u00e2n kings in Syria, inviting him to profess Isl\u00e2m, and he complied as soon as he had become acquainted with the [contents of the] exalted epistle. He also wrote a reply and sent gifts to his lordship, and was still a professor during the Khalifate of F\u00e2ruq the greater [i.e., Omar]. In those days he once came to circumambulate the Ka'bah, but for a reason which will also be recorded in this volume he fled from Madinah, apostatized and joined the Byzantine emperor. During this year Qowdah B. A'mru Judh\u00e2my, who was the first-named emperor's governor at O'mm\u00e2n, in the Bulgarian country, also became a Musalm\u00e2n, and having written a letter to his lordship, he gave it to an attendant, Masu'd\nB. Sa\u2019yd by name, who also carried presents from him to Madinah. When this epistle reached the august assembly his lordship ordered it to be read, and the contents thereof were as follows: \u2018I have made the profession of the Faith and confessed the unity of God. I know thee to be the same true prophet whose advent was predicted by I\u2019sa [Jesus], the son of Maryam. Farewell!\u2019 When the apostle of God received this information he showed much kindness and respect to Masu\u2019d, ordered Ball\u00e2l to take him to his own house and to prepare a repast for him. The presents of Qowdah consisted of a white mule, a tunic of brocade embroidered with gold, etc., which his lordship accepted, and sent him the following reply: \u2018Muhammad, the apostle of Allah, to Qowdah B. A\u2019mru. But after [the usual compliments I say]: Thy envoy has arrived, has brought thy gifts, and has informed us of thy good health. Verily Allah has pointed out to thee the right way. If thou followest it, obey God and His prophet, observe the appointed times of prayer, and pay the Dzak\u00e2t.\u2019 [i.e., legal alms]. Then he ordered Ball\u00e2l to give five hundred dirhems to the envoy and dismissed him. Let it not remain hidden that historians consider Qowdah to have become Governor of Syria after the demise of H\u00e2reth B. Abu Shamm\u00e2r Ghus\u00e2ny, and that the latter died in the eighth year after the Flight. According to this statement it would appear that Qowdah had become a Musalm\u00e2n in the eighth year or after it. As, however, biographers [considered more reliable] have stated that Qowdah professed Isl\u00e1m before the eighth year, the author of this work has followed them, although this discrepancy cannot be reconciled. Allah, however, is most wise.\n\nIn this year his lordship the refuge of the apostolate\u2014u. w. b.\u2014appointed A\u2019bdullah B. Ru\u00e2hah over a detachment of troops and sent him to Aa\u2019m. In that expedition also Abu Qot\u00e2dah and Muhkum B. Kut\u00e2mah were present. During the march they met A\u2019amer Allassant Allashja\u2019y, who had made his profession of the Faith, and was going to wait upon his lordship the apostle of God. When he\nmet the companions he saluted them like a professor of Isl\u00e2m, but they gave no reply, and Muhkum slew him. When this news reached his lordship the best of men, and Muhkum was admitted to the honour of kissing his feet, his lordship reproached him, saying: 'Why hast thou killed a Musalm\u00e2n?' Muhkum replied: 'Because A'amer had feigned to be a Musalm\u00e2n to escape death.' His lordship continued: 'Hast thou slit open his heart and ascertained his intention and will? The tongue is the interpreter and ambassador of the heart.' The apostle of God then cursed Muhkum, who surrendered his life to the grasper of souls after the expiration of one hour. After he had been interred he was thrown out of his grave, which having happened thrice, the people at last concealed his body under stones, whereon his lordship said: 'The earth covers worse men than Muhkum, but God the Most High wanted to show you the esteem in which he holds martyrs [such as A'amer].'\n\n**The Events of the Eighth Year after the Flight of the Lord of Prophecy\u2014U. W. B.**\n\nAccording to all the biographers, Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd and A'mru B. Ala'ass and Ttolhah B. Ttolhah Ala'bdary were during this year adorned with the decoration of the Faith. Kh\u00e2led says that at the time when the apostle of God had proceeded to Mekkah with the intention of performing the visitation, and had arrived in Ghus\u00e2n, the Qoraish issued from the sanctuary for the purpose of repelling him, and had also arrived in that locality. 'One day I saw the apostle of God holding the prayers of fear with his companions, and although I desired to injure them [i.e., the Musalm\u00e2ns] on that occasion, and was unable to do so, I knew that the Almighty was the protector and defender of the apostle and of his friends, that he would soon vanquish his opponents, and would be granted the victory.'\n\nIt is related in the *Raudzatu-l-\u00e2hb\u00e2b* that there is a tradition of Kh\u00e2led B. Wolyd wherein he is said to have\n\n---\n\n357 Began May 1, 629 A.D.\nspoken as follows: 'When the eternal decree, predestined by Allah that I should become a Musalm\u00e2n, was to be fulfilled, He inspired me with love for the professors of Isl\u00e2m, but especially on the day when the prophet was holding the prayer of fear on his march to Hodaybiah in the station of Ghuttf\u00e2n. I desired to get him into my power, and, being unable to succeed, I knew that he was protected by Divine grace, and that he would soon overpower us. When peace had been concluded between us and him, I apprehended that power and dignity had departed from the Qoraish, but I could not go to the Najj\u00e2shy [Negus of Abyssinia] because he had become a follower of Muhammad; accordingly I conceived the intention to betake myself to Heraclius and to make a profession of the Christian or the Jewish religion.' The writer of these pages says that as Kh\u00e2led B. Wolyd knew that whoever uttered the formula of monotheism gained the favour of Allah and the apostle, and that the line of forgiveness and oblivion would be drawn over the record of his transgressions, he ought, after love for the professors of Isl\u00e2m had prevailed in his heart, immediately to have waited upon the apostle of God and uttered the profession of the Faith, without intending to go to Heraclius, or vacillating between the adoption of the Christian or the Jewish religion; and therefore the tradition is more credible wherein no allusion occurs to the love he bore towards the professors of Isl\u00e2m during the time of ignorance. The [true] knowledge, however, is with Allah.\n\nIn short, Kh\u00e2led says: 'When I thought of going to Heraclius, I again considered whether I ought not to remain in our own country, to see what would come forth from the curtain of futurity. On that occasion the apostle of God was marching to Mekkah to hold the predestined visitation (O'mratu-l-qadz\u00e2). I absented myself, but my brother Wolyd B. Alwolyd, who had arrived in Mekkah with his lordship the apostle of God, was searching for me; as, however, he was unable to find me, he sent me a letter with the information that his holy and prophetic lordship\nhad remembered me, and had said: \"Khaled is an excellent, noble, and glorious individual. One like him cannot have remained ignorant of my mission; had he but visited me, I would have shown him much civility, would have raised his position in life, and would have held him in higher esteem than many other men.\" He also wrote: \"Dear Brother,\u2014I am astonished that thou becomest not a Musalm\u0101n, and still travellest in the desert of aberration, without atoning for bygones. Delay not to attain this felicity [of professing Isl\u0101m], but strive to gain it quickly, for thou hast already lost many advantages. Farewell.\"\n\nKh\u0101led says: 'When I had learnt the contents of this letter love for Isl\u0101m induced me to start to Madinah, and in conformity with the maxim, \"First a companion and then the journey,\" I went to Ssafuw\u0101n B. Ommyah and spoke to him as follows: \"O Abu Wohb, seest thou not that we have not a crumb of bread left, and that the rumour of Muhammad's success is permeating the whole world? If thou deemest it fit, we shall hasten to wait on Muhammad, because his honour is our honour.\" Ssafuw\u0101n, however, laid the hand of refusal upon my request, mentioned great difficulties, and said: \"If no other person of the Qoraish is left except myself I shall not follow Muhammad.\" Then I said to myself: \"I cannot expect this man to accompany me, because his father and brother have been killed on the day of Bedr.\" After that I met Akramah B. Abu Jahl, and invited him to walk on the straight road, but he likewise rejected my advice. Having despaired of the acquiescence of these two men, I saw O'thm\u0101n B. Ttolh\u0101h and read to him the pages of exhortation. He accepted my invitation, and we departed together to Madinah. When we arrived in Hara we found there A'mru B. Ala'ass, who questioned us, and when we informed him of the object of our journey, he said: \"I have also come from Abyssinia for the same purpose.\" Then we travelled with him, and entered Madinah in his company. When his lordship the apostle became aware of our arrival, he said to his companions: \"The Mekkans\nhave thrown to you their very heart's blood.' Khaled continues: 'When we arrived in Madinah we exchanged our travelling clothes for handsome ones, intending to hasten and to meet the apostle of God. On the way my brother Wolyd came up to us, and said: \"Come quickly; the apostle of God has heard of thy arrival and is much pleased therewith, waiting for thy appearance.\" I took my brother's advice and hastened our progress till I reached the august assembly of his lordship the apostle. When the blessed eye of that prince alighted on me he smiled.\n\nDistich: A fairy killed men with sweet smiles;\nI said to her: \"Kill me too.\" But she smiled again.\n\nThen I said: \"Greeting to thee, O apostle of Allah!\" He appeared somewhat surprised, and I continued: \"I testify that there is no God but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is the apostle of Allah.\" He rejoined: \"Glory and praise be to God, who has directed thee, O Kh\u00e2led. I perceived thou art intelligent and wise, and entertained hopes that God would lead thee to the good road.\" I answered: \"O apostle of God, thou hast seen how much I resisted the truth in the infidel regions. Intercede for me with God the Most High, that He may forgive my past transgressions.\" He continued: \"O Kh\u00e2led, the profession of Isl\u00e2m blots out all former sins.\" I said: \"Nevertheless, be thou my intercessor.\" Then he said: \"O God, pardon the sins formerly committed by Kh\u00e2led B. Wolyd.\" After that also A'mru B. Ala'ass and Ttolhah B. O'thm\u00e2n B. Abu Ttolhah Abdary made their profession of the faith.'\n\nGAZWAH OF DH\u00c2T-ASSIL\u00c2SIL.\n\nThere is a tradition of W\u00e2qidi that A'mru B. Ala'ass said: 'When I became ennobled by professing the Faith I said: \"O apostle of God, I have for some time tried to demolish the castle of Isl\u00e2m; but now I should like to leave some traces of my profession of the Faith.\"' That prince replied: 'I shall send thee to a locality, if it pleaseth Allah the Most High.' It is related that while A'mru was\nwaiting to be appointed to a command the information reached the exalted audition of the best of men that a number of the Bani Qadzaa'h had agreed to attack a certain region belonging to the professors of Isl\u00e1m. The prophet accordingly despatched A'mru B. Ala'ass with three hundred men to extirpate the opponents, appointing him to command those troops, to march to W\u00e1dy-l-qara, and to halt in a serai called Sil\u00e2sil. When A'mru had departed from Madinah and marched against the idolaters, he heard that another detachment of the Bett\u00e2raqah had made common cause with the Bani Qadzaa'h, and being disquieted by this news, he sent a courier to his lordship with the information and a request for aid. The apostle of God thereon despatched a company, in which also Ssiddyq and F\u00e2r\u00fbq were enrolled, to reinforce A'mru, appointing Abu O'baydah to be the commander thereof, and at the time of parting his holy and prophetic lordship ordered the latter not to disagree with his companions in arms. When this second detachment joined A'mru B. Ala'ass, he said to O'baydah: 'As thou hast come to assist me, thou must hold prayers in my rear [I being the leader].'\n\nO'baydah, however, replied: 'Thou art the commander of the troops which arrived first, and I of those which arrived now.' A'mru objected also to this arrangement; but as O'baydah kept in mind the injunction of the apostle of God, he abstained from quarrelling, and held his prayers in the rear of A'mru.\n\nAfter A'mru had thus been reinforced by Abu O'baydah, he began to plunder the country of the opponents, and captured much cattle, whereon the army returned satisfied to Madinah, and was admitted to the felicity of kissing the feet of his lordship the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\n\nIt is related that when A'mru waited on the prince of existences\u2014to whom be the most excellent greetings\u2014his lordship asked how the warriors of Isl\u00e1m had obeyed and agreed with each other, whereon A'mru expressed his entire satisfaction with them. The prophet then likewise asked the troops how A'mru had behaved towards them\nin that expedition, and they all remembered him with gratitude, but, nevertheless, conveyed to the exalted audition of his lordship the information that he had one morning held prayers in a state of pollution [which made them invalid]. When the apostle desired to know the particulars of this affair, A\u2019mru replied: \u2018That day was very cold; I was in fear for my life, and therefore failed to perform the religious ablution; and the Lord God Almighty has said: \u201cDo not commit suicide.\u201d\u2019 The apostle of God smiled at these words, and said: \u2018Look out how you may procure deliverance for yourselves [from sin].\u2019\n\nIt is related that A\u2019mru, having been the commander of the troops in the above expedition, among whom were both Ssiddyq and F\u00e2r\u00fbq, he imagined that his holy and prophetic lordship loved him more than those two blessed individuals. Hoping to obtain certainty on this point, he once asked: \u2018O apostle of God, what person lovest thou most?\u2019 He replied: \u2018A\u2019ayshah.\u2019 A\u2019mru continued: \u2018I ask about men.\u2019 He answered: \u2018My father\u2019 [Abu Bakr]. He further asked: \u2018Who comes after him?\u2019 He said: \u2018O\u2019mar.\u2019 Thus A\u2019mru continued to ask until the apostle of God had mentioned with his wonderfully eloquent tongue the names of all his friends, so that A\u2019mru learnt that command, or authority over the army, implies an honour, but not a greater degree of the love of his lordship the prophet.\n\nThe Ghaz\u00e2 of Mowtah.\n\nThe author of the Mostaqadza relates that, according to the \u2018Names of Places,\u2019 Mowtah with Hamza is the name of a village of Bolq\u00e2r in the country of Syria, and that without Hamza it means a state of lunacy or swoon. In the commentary of Ebn Hajar we read that most of the traditionists spell Mowtah with Hamza, but that it is not hamzated by some. Waqidi says: \u2018The reason for this campaign was that his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had sent a letter to the Governor of Bossra [in Syria], which was to be delivered to him by H\u00e1reth B. O\u2019mayr Azdy; but when the letter had reached Mowtah, he was met by\nShorahbyl B. A'mru Ghas\u00e2ny, who was one of the Amirs of the Qayssar, and who asked him: \"Where art thou travelling to?\" He replied: \"To Syria.\" Then Shorahbyl caused him to be slain, and this was the only one of the envoys of the best of prophets and apostles who was killed. When his lordship was informed of this event he became angry, informed the people of the murder of H\u00e2reth, and ordered Musalm\u00e2n troops to march to Syria and attack the enemy. Accordingly preparations for a campaign were made by order of his lordship, and an army of three thousand men assembled in a place called Jaraf. When all the arrangements of the troops of Isl\u00e2m had been completed, his lordship held matutinal prayers and addressed them as follows: \"I appoint Zayd B. H\u00e2rethah to be your commander; and if he be killed, Ja'fer B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb is to take his place. If Ja'fer falls, A'bdullah B. Ru\u00e2hah is to command you; and if he be likewise slain, the professors of Isl\u00e2m are to elect one of their own number to be their general.\" On that occasion there was a Jew present, who said: \"O father of Q\u00e2sim, if thy claim to prophecy be true, every man whom thou hast mentioned as a commander will be killed; because when the prophets of the children of Esr\u00e2yl sent an army against the enemy, and appointed even one hundred individuals in this manner, they were all slain.\" After that the Jew said also to Zayd: \"O Zayd, I assure thee that, if Muhammad be a [true] prophet, thou wilt not return from this expedition.\" Zayd replied: \"I bear witness that he is a prophet, veracious and beneficent.\"\n\nWhen the army of Isl\u00e2m marched, his holy and prophetic lordship accompanied it as far as Thanyatu-l-wodaa', where he halted. The Musalm\u00e2n troops being drawn up around him, his lordship said: \"Fight in the name of Allah the Most High and Glorious, killing His and your foes who are in Syria. There you will find men who live in monasteries, separated from mankind. Do not injure them. Spare also the lives of all women and suckling babes. Do not fell date or other trees, and do not destroy houses.\"\n\nIt is related that A'bdullah B. Ru\u00e2hah said: 'O apostle\nof God, order me to do something.' He accordingly said:\n'Thou art going to a town where there is but little adora-\ntion; therefore thou must pray much.' A'bdullah con-\ntinued: 'O apostle of God, order me to do something more.'\nHe then added: 'Think much of God, for He will aid thee\nin all thy petitions.'\n\nZayd B. Arqum says: 'I was living in the shadow of\nA'bdullah B. Ru\u00e2hah's protection and obeyed him, and I\nnever saw a man taking better care of orphans than he\ndid. When he went to Mowtah I accompanied him, and\nwas mounted in his rear when we travelled. Whilst on this\njourney he recited one night verses which wafted the odour\nof martyrdom to my nostrils, so that I began to weep; but\nhe calmed me, saying: \"My son, what injury will it be to\nthee if God the Most High grants me martyrdom, and I am\ndelivered of this world and of its vicissitudes?\" After this\nconversation he alighted from the camel, prostrated him-\nself, and prayed much, with several flexions. After he had\nterminated his devotions to the Supreme Judge and Granter\nof Requests, he said to me: \"Son, it is probable that God\nthe Most High and Glorious will respond to my prayers,\nand will allow me to taste the beverage of martyrdom, con-\nferring that sweet pleasure upon me.\"\n\nIt is related that when Shorahbyl, who was the assassin\nof H\u00e2reth, had been informed of the approach of the army\nof Isl\u00e2m, he made preparations for war and contention by\nassembling an army, the numbers whereof covered the\nmountains and the plains. The Musalm\u00e2ns, on their part,\nmarched till they arrived in W\u00e2dy-l-qara, where they\nhalted, and to which place Shorahbyl despatched his\nbrother Sad\u00fbs with fifty men for the purpose of recon-\nnoitring; but they were surprised by the Musalm\u00e2ns, who\nkilled Sad\u00fbs. When Shorahbyl was apprised of the death\nof his brother he became frightened, took refuge in a fort,\nand sent his other brother to the Qayssar, who was at\nBalq\u00e2, to ask for reinforcements. The Qayssar accordingly\nsent a great multitude to aid Shorahbyl, who was also\njoined by the idolaters of the Arab tribes, so that the\nnumbers of the opponents surpassed one hundred thousand. When the Musalm\u00e2ns heard this news they halted at the station of Mogh\u00e2n, consulted each other, and said: 'We must submit the state of affairs to the cognizance of the apostle of God, who will be able either to recall us or to send us reinforcements.' A'bdullah B. Ru\u00e2hah, however, encouraged the troops, and spoke to them as follows: 'O people, are you disliking an object for attaining which you have left your country, namely, martyrdom? Verily, we have never gained a victory by the multitude of our numbers. On the day of Bedr our army was very small, and we had not more than two horses; but Allah the Most High has not refused us the victory. Now we must all agree to fight unanimously, because there are only two issues, i.e., victory or martyrdom. If the former is our share, no one will complain; and if the latter, we shall go to paradise and meet our friends who have been honoured with martyrdom.' The Musalm\u00e2ns approved of the proposal of A'bdullah, marched towards the enemy, and reached the village of Mowtah.\n\nAbu Haryrah says: 'At Mowtah I beheld the army of Heraclius. The great number of our opponents and their [bright] accoutrements dazzled my eyes. Th\u00e2bet B. Aqd\u00e2m said to me: \"Abu Haryrah, perchance thou art amazed at the great number of the enemy.\" I replied: \"Yes.\" He continued: \"Thou hast been present at Bedr, where God the Most High and Holy has vouchsafed us the victory not by the magnitude, but by the smallness, of our numbers.\"\n\nIt is related that when the two armies approached each other, and the lines were drawn out\u2014\n\nDistich: The sea of contest boiled,\nAnd the warriors roared.\n\nZayd B. H\u00e2rethah grasped the standard, placed the foot of bravery into the plain of contest, and fought till he attained martyrdom by a spear-wound. After him Ja'fer B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb took charge of the banner, capered forward\n\n358 This is the name of one of the companions, i.e., 'father or possessor of the kitten,' because he always carried one about him.\non his horse, and attacked the foes, who overpowered him and sliced off his right hand, whereon Ja\u2019fer held the flag with his left; but when that was likewise cut off he clenched the banner with [the stumps of] his arms, till a [Byzantine] Greek struck his waist with a sabre and divided him in twain. Then A\u2019bdullah snatched up the banner, and fought till he [also] attained martyrdom. Th\u00e2bet B. Aqd\u00e2m the Anss\u00e2ri thereon grasped the flag, and exclaimed: \u2018O Musalm\u00e2ns, name a commander!\u2019 The professors of Isl\u00e2m accordingly elected Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd, and when he took the command after Th\u00e2bet had likewise fallen the Musalm\u00e2ns began to flee, despite of all his entreaties [to the contrary]. When, however, one of the valiant professors of Isl\u00e2m exclaimed \u2018It is better to be slain in battle than to run,\u2019 the Musalm\u00e2ns were comforted, returned, and fought till night. The next morning Kh\u00e2led arranged the lines, and changed the position of the army in such a manner that the enemies thought the Musalm\u00e2ns had obtained reinforcements. Therefore they became afraid and fled. Kh\u00e2led then pursued the fugitives, and displayed great feats of prowess. It is related that Kh\u00e2led said: \u2018On that day my sword broke in my hand, but I had a Yemeni sabre left.\u2019 After Kh\u00e2led had terminated his pursuit of the enemy he turned towards Madinah; but besieged during the march a fort, the inhabitants whereof had slain a Musalm\u00e2n when the army was advancing to Mowtah. The fort having been conquered, a number of the wicked, who were dwelling in that locality, met their deaths at the hand of Kh\u00e2led.\n\nIt is related that when the two armies, i.e., the Musalm\u00e2ns and the forces of Shorahbyl, were standing opposite to each other the curtain [of separation] disappeared, so that the battle-field became visible to his holy and prophetic lordship, who informed the companions concerning the state of those who were at Mowtah, saying: \u2018Zayd has taken the flag and was struck; then Ja\u2019fer took it and was struck; then Ebn Ru\u00e2hah took it and was struck.\u2019 The prince of the righteous\u2014u. w. b.\u2014continued to speak thus,\nwhilst tears were flowing from his blessed eyes upon his blessed cheeks. He continued: 'After Ebn Ru\u00e2hah [had also fallen] a sword of the swords of God the Most High and Glorious snatched up the banner, and the victory was gained by His power.' By the sword of God he meant Kh\u00e2led B. Wolyd, who was on that day surnamed 'the sword of God.' His lordship said with reference to Ja\u2019fer B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb: 'He has entered paradise, and God the Most High has given to Ja\u2019fer two wings of red rubies, instead of his two hands, so that he may fly wherever he likes, and for this reason he will be surnamed \"the flying Ja\u2019fer.\"'\n\nA\u2019bdullah B. A\u2019bb\u00e2s says: 'One day Asm\u00e2, the daughter of O\u2019mys and wife of Ja\u2019fer, was sitting in the assembly of his lordship the refuge of the apostolate\u2014u. w. b.\u2014when the latter exclaimed: \"O Asm\u00e2, this is Ja\u2019fer B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb, who has arrived with Jebr\u00e2\u00eel and Myk\u00e2yl, bringing salutations and the following news: 'When I fought the enemy I received seventy-two wounds. I held the banner in my right hand, but that was cut off; then I took it in my left, which was likewise cut off. God the Most High has, however, given me two wings in lieu of my hands, so that I may fly about in paradise with Jebr\u00e2\u00eel and Myk\u00e2yl wherever I like, and that I may eat those fruits of paradise which are most palatable to me.'\"\n\nAsm\u00e2 replied: \"Let Ja\u2019fer rejoice at whatever the Creator has bestowed upon him, but I fear that if I repeat the above words to the people they will accuse me of falsehood. If thou, O apostle of God, impartest to them the information, they will certainly believe and will acknowledge his excellency.\" Accordingly, when the companions had assembled around his lordship, he narrated a portion of the virtues of Ja\u2019fer at the request of Asm\u00e2.'\n\nIt is on record that three or four days after the apostle of God had informed his companions about the events of Mowtah the news of the battle between the enemies and the Musalm\u00e2ns arrived in Madinah, and when one of the combatants of Mowtah, Ya\u2019ly B. Sanyah by name, entered the\naugust assembly of his lordship the prince of the world, the latter asked: 'Ya'ly, shall I give thee news, or wilt thou give us some?' Ya'ly replied: 'O apostle of God, give thou the news.' His holy and prophetic lordship thereon narrated the state of affairs, and Ya'ly exclaimed: 'I swear by that God who has sent thee in reality that thou hast omitted none of the events of the people.' His lordship continued: 'God, whose name be blessed and sanctified, had taken up the region and placed it before my eyes, to let me see the battle-field of my companions.' There is likewise a tradition of Asm\u00e2, the relict of Ja'fer, that she said: 'On the day when the news of my husband's martyrdom arrived I was tanning a hide, and after that I washed the heads and faces of my children, Muhammad and A'bdu'llah, whom I afterwards suckled. A short time had elapsed when the apostle of God entered the house and asked for the children of Ja'fer, whom I then produced. He kissed and smelled them, then he took them into his arms and fondled them. I perceived, however, signs of grief on his blessed forehead, and asked: \"O apostle of God, perhaps thou hast received news about Ja'fer?\" He replied: \"Yes; my cousin and brother Ja'fer has attained martyrdom, and my friends were slain with him.\" Asm\u00e2 continues: 'I rose. My great distress and impatience caused me to break out in wailings, so that most of the women of Madinah assembled in my house, and the apostle of God exclaimed: \"Asm\u00e2, speak no nonsense, and strike not thy breast.\" He then departed, with his heart full of sorrow and his eyes full of tears, to the house of Fattimah Zohrah, whom he found also weeping and lamenting for the loss of Ja'fer.' Asm\u00e2 says: 'The heart-burning of the apostle of God increased when he saw the tears of his darling, but he said: \"If you bemoan any person [after this], bemoan him as you do Ja'fer.\"\n\nDistich: Luckless eye! where is thy gory stream?\nIf thou canst weep blood for Ja'fer, do so!\n\nHis lordship then continued: \"Prepare food for the family of Ja'fer, because they are mourning for their relatives, and\nhave no time for cooking.\u201d A\u2019bdullah B. Abu Bakr says: \u2018On account of this hint of the prince of existences\u2014to whom the most excellent greetings\u2014regarding the family of Ja\u2019fer, the custom of sending victuals to grief-stricken persons has survived till our times in Madinah.\u2019 The author of the Mostaqalza relates that, according to a statement in the Ssahyh of Bokh\u00e2ry, whenever Ebn O\u2019mar greeted the son of Ja\u2019fer, he said to him: \u2018Salutation to thee, O son of him who has two wings!\u2019\n\nWaqidi states that the apostle of God gave to the family and children of Ja\u2019fer three days to mourn for him, and that afterwards he went to their house, saying: \u2018Weep no longer for my brother Ja\u2019fer, and distress not his children any more.\u2019 It is related of A\u2019bdullah, the son of Ja\u2019fer, that he said: \u2018When we were brought to the apostle of God a stream of bitter tears flowed from our eyes, and all our limbs trembled. When he beheld our miserable condition the wounds of his heart again bled, and his sorrow increased. He ordered a barber to shave our heads, and said: \u201cMuhammad, the son of Ja\u2019fer, resembles my uncle Abu Tt\u00e2leb, but A\u2019bdullah is the darling of the people and of the creation. He is like me in features and in manners.\u201d Then he took me by the hand, raised it, and said: \u201cO Lord, give pious successors to Ja\u2019fer, and vouchsafe them Thy blessing.\u201d Then our mother approached the lord of apostleship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014representing our helpless and unprotected condition, so that he began to weep. He then asked: \u201cFearest thou that misfortune and poverty will overtake them whilst I am their protector in this world and in the next?\u201d A\u2019bdullah says: \u2018One day the apostle of God saw me selling a sheep, and exclaimed, \u201cO God, bless his transaction!\u201d And after that I became very lucky in buying and selling.\u2019\n\nIt has been noticed above that one of the conditions [of the Treaty] of Hodaybiah was that the Musalm\u00e2ns should not injure any allies of the Qoraish, and the latter were to deal in the same way [towards the allies of the Musalm\u00e2ns]. At that time the Khozaa\u2019h, to whom the ancestors of\nA'bd-ul-Muttalleb had belonged, presented their compact to his lordship, who, being aware of their connection with A'bd-ul-Muttalleb, admitted them at their own request into the league, so that every treaty concluded during the time of ignorance should be even more binding in the time of Isl\u00e2m. At that time also the Bani Bakr entered into an alliance with the Qoraish, although before the promulgation of Isl\u00e2m enmity had subsisted between these two clans\u2014i.e., the Bani Bakr and the Khozaa'h\u2014and they had waged war against each other. After the mission they became so apprehensive of the success of the apostle of God that they ceased quarrelling with each other. When, however, in consequence of the Treaty of Hodaybiah, the idolaters were liberated from their apprehensions concerning the Musalm\u00e2ns, they relapsed into their former enmity, which happened as follows: One day a man of the Bani Dhyl, who are a portion of the B\u00e2ni Bakr, spoke insulting words about the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014which were heard by a slave of the Bani Khozaa'h, who reprimanded the above-named individual, but was grievously beaten by him. After that the man of the Bani Dhyl took refuge with the Bani Bakr and the Bani Naf\u00e2sah [the latter being a subdivision of the former], endeavouring to induce them to attack the Bani Khozaa'h. They assented, and also desired the Bani Madyh to aid them, who, however, refused to comply. The Bani Bakr then returned to the Qoraish, who broke their treaty with the lord of apostleship, and assisted the Bani Bakr with arms and other appliances of war. Some of the Qoraish nobles, such as Sohayl B. A'mru, and Hoyttab B. A'bdu-l-u'zza, and Akramah B. Abu Jahl, and Ssafuw\u00e2n B. Ommyah, and Mukraz B. Hafass, went even so far as to disguise their persons, tying veils over their faces, and joining in this manner their confederates, the Bani Bakr, with whom they surprised the Bani Khozaa'h in the night, the result being a dreadful contest, which was carried even into the territory of the sanctuary, and twenty men of the Khozaa'h were slain. In their distress the latter spoke as follows to Naofel B. Moa'wiah, who was the chief of the\nBani Bakr: 'O Naofel, fear God and respect His sanctuary!' Naofel replied: 'Your admonition is worthy of regard, but at present I have no occasion to fear God, because you have been accustomed to steal the goods of the pilgrims to the sanctuary, and now you have been punished for it.' When the Bani Khoza'a'h became tired of struggling and fighting, they threw themselves into the mansion of R\u0101fi'. Then Hodzayl B. Warq\u0101' Khozaa'y and the Bani Bakr, as well as the Qoraish nobles, thinking that nobody had recognised them, went to their respective domiciles.\n\nAfter the idolaters of Mekkah had committed this act of treachery, they repented of what they had done, and were sorry for having broken their covenant. Accordingly, H\u00e1reth B. Hesh\u00e2m and A'bdullah B. Abu Rabya'h went to Abu Sofy\u00e2n B. Harb, and said: 'An event has taken place which cannot be concealed, and a calamity has occurred which we must remedy. For if we cannot arrange this affair, Muhammad will take up arms against us, and will shed our blood to avenge those of the Khoza'a'h who have been slain.' Abu Sofy\u00e2n replied: 'My wife Hirda has dreamt a dream which frightens me greatly.' They asked: 'What was it?' He continued: 'She dreamt that she had seen blood flowing from the direction of the Hajbon towards Mekkah, until it reached the sanctuary, where it stagnated awhile and then disappeared.' This vision augmented also the fear of the hearers, and Abu Sofy\u00e2n continued: 'I swear by God that the slaughter was committed neither by my advice nor approbation, but Muhammad and his companions will think that I have been the originator of that untoward affair and blameworthy event. I must therefore go to Madinah and renew the peace ere the information reaches Muhammad.' In short, the opponents were greatly dismayed, and Abu Sofy\u00e2n made preparations for his journey.\n\nIt is related that on the morning which preceded the\n\n350 This was a small water-course, but liable to be flooded, and to cause great damage in that condition to houses, and even to the Ka'bah.\nnight of the defeat of the Bani Bakr, his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014addressed to Ssiddyqah [i.e., A\u2019ayshah] the following words: \u2018Verily, a misfortune has befallen the Khozaa\u2019h.\u2019 A\u2019ayshah replied: \u2018O apostle of God, thinkest thou that the Qoraish will dare to break the peace after they have been subdued by the sword?\u2019 He replied: \u2018They break the treaty to fulfil the purpose of God.\u2019 She asked: \u2018What purpose is it, O prince of existences?\u2019 He answered: \u2018It will be a good one.\u2019 It is related that Maym\u00fbnah\u2014u. w. b.\u2014said: \u2018When the apostle came out from the water-closet, he exclaimed: \u201cAid, aid!\u201d I asked: \u201cO apostle of God, with whom art thou conversing?\u201d He replied: \u201cThe speaker of these Rajaz verses is one of the Bani Ka\u2019b, of the tribe Khozaa\u2019h, who asks aid from me, and says: \u2018The Qoraish have assisted the Bani Bakr in their night-attack upon us.\u2019\u201d\u2019\n\nIt is related that when three days had elapsed after this event, A\u2019mru B. S\u00e2lem Khozaa\u2019y arrived in Madinah with forty men of his friends, and when his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014was sitting in the mosque with his companions, he was admitted to the felicity of kissing his feet, and standing opposite to that prince, he recited an elegy relating the destruction of the peace by the Qoraish, the transgression of the Bani Bakr, and the weakness of the Khozaa\u2019h. After this elegy had been completed, the apostle of God said: \u2018I thank thee, A\u2019mru.\u2019 Then he rose, dragging his blessed Red\u00e2 [wrapper] after himself on the ground, and said: \u2018May I not receive help, if I do not give help to the Bani Ka\u2019b in the same way as I would help [to save] my own life!\u2019 At the same time he also dismissed the Khozaa\u2019h men, ordering them to disperse in the W\u00e2dys. In some biographical works it is also narrated that when the Khozaa\u2019hs had informed his lordship the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014that Anus B. Wohum had derided him, and that they were angry for it, his lordship exclaimed: \u2018Let his blood be shed.\u2019 When Anus heard this news he came to Madinah with Naofel B. Moa\u2019wiah, and recited in the august assembly of his lordship the\nMusstafa an elegy of homage and excuse, after which Naofel said: 'O apostle of God, thou pardonest the transgressions of all who have sinned against thee. Indeed, there is not a man of us who had not borne enmity to thee while we were in ignorance, but through thee we have obtained [Divine] guidance. O apostle of God, the people are accusing Anus falsely.' The apostle of God, however, retorted: 'Do not inculpate the people falsely. Because in Tah\u00e2mah, far and wide, I have not met with more veracious men.' Naofel then became silent, and his lordship continued: 'I pardon Anus.' Naofel said: 'May my father and mother be a sacrifice for thee.' The author of these pages remarks that there are objections against [the correctness of] this tradition, but as the present work is merely a compendium, he refrains from recording them in this place.\n\nChroniclers narrate that before Abu Sofy\u00e1n had arrived in Madinah his lordship said: 'I fancy Abu Sofy\u00e1n is coming to advise me to renew our treaty, and to prolong the stipulated time of the peace; but he shall return disappointed and sad.' When Abu Sofy\u00e1n arrived in Madinah, after duly performing the journey, he went, according to one tradition, first to his daughter Omm Jamilah\u2014who had been enrolled in the ranks of the mothers of the Musalm\u00e1ns\u2014and was about to sit down on the bed of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014but Omm Jamilah folded up the bed, whereon Abu Sofy\u00e1n asked: 'Daughter, considerest thou me unworthy of the bed, or the bed of me?' She replied: 'This is the bed of the prince of the clean and the pure, but as thou art allied to idolatry and defilement, I have not considered thee worthy to sit on the bed.' Abu Sofy\u00e1n continued: 'Evil has befallen thee since we separated, because thy good manners are changed, and thy noble qualities altered.' She, however, rejoined: 'I thank Allah that He has blessed me with Isl\u00e1m, and has bestowed upon me the favour of\n\n360 I.e., one whom the prophet had married; all of his wives enjoyed this title of honour.\n[Divine] guidance. I am amazed that thou who art the leader of the Qoraish and the prince of thy nation, a man enjoying glory, possessing the government, endowed with intelligence and penetration, hast not become a Musalm\u00e2n, but worshippest a stone, which can neither see nor hear, and from which neither evil can be feared nor good can be expected.' Abu Sofy\u00e2n rejoined: 'In addition to thy impudence, thou askest me to apostatize from the religion of my ancestors and forefathers, to abandon their gods, to adopt the religion of Muhammad, and to follow him.' After uttering these words he left the house of his daughter, and met his lordship; but though he insisted much on the renewal of the treaty and the prolongation of the truce, he received no satisfactory reply. Then he went to Abu Bakr with the same proposal, but he replied: 'I have no authority.' Therefore he applied in a despondent and sad mood to O'mar, who gave him an angry reply. Then Abu Sofy\u00e2n applied to the exalted threshold of the princess of the women of this world, namely, Fattimah Zohrah\u2014u. w. b.\u2014saying: 'I request thee to take us under thy protection.' She, however, replied: 'I am a woman, and my protection is of no account.' But Abu Sofy\u00e2n continued: 'Thy sister Zaynab had given quarter to her husband Abu-l-a'ass, and Muhammad respected it.' Fattimah rejoined: 'I undertake no affair without the command of the apostle of God.' Abu Sofy\u00e2n continued: 'Instruct [thy sons] Hasan and Hosayn to endeavour to attain my purpose.' Fattimah said: 'My children are small, and can do nothing without the permission of his lordship.' Then Abu Sofy\u00e2n went to A'li, and said: 'O father of Hasan, thou art more closely related to me than others, and must intercede for me with Muhammad, that he may renew our treaty, and prolong the armistice.' But A'li replied: 'Woe betide thee, O Abu Sofy\u00e2n, for trying to bring on a negotiation which his lordship the apostle dislikes.' Abu Sofy\u00e2n said: 'I am distressed, and do not know how to act. Tell me what to do, for I am helpless.' A'li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014\nreplied: 'Thou art the prince of the nation, and canst do nothing better than to rise in the midst of the people and to exclaim: \"I have induced the people on both sides to agree to the prolongation of the armistice.\"' Abu Sofy\u00e2n asked: 'Shall I be successful if I act as thou sayest?' A'li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014replied: 'I do not know whether thou wilt attain thy purpose by this means, but I know of no other means.' Abu Sofy\u00e2n accordingly rose in a solemn assembly, and exclaimed: 'O ye people, be ye aware, and let it be known unto you, that I have got men on both sides to agree to my proposal, and that I believe Muhammad will not reject my petition.' After that he went to the assembly of the lord of existences\u2014u. w. b.\u2014represented his case, and said: 'O Muhammad, I do not think thou wilt reject my petition.' But his lordship uttered nothing in reply, except the words: 'O Abu Sofy\u00e2n, thou sayest so.' Then Abu Sofy\u00e2n returned to Mekkah, but his absence having been prolonged, the Qoraish imagined that he had adopted the orthodox religion and abandoned idolatry. After duly traversing the distance, Abu Sofy\u00e2n arrived in Mekkah, entering his house during the night. His wife Hinda said: 'Thou hast stayed so long that the people are suspicious of thy having become a follower of Muhammad. Nevertheless, all will be right if thy journey has been successful.' Abu Sofy\u00e2n then narrated to Hinda what had happened to him, but she struck his breast with her foot, saying: 'An evil ambassador art thou! A'li has made sport of thee!' In the morning Abu Sofy\u00e2n paid a visit to two idols, called As\u00e2f and N\u00e2ylah, and after having offered a sacrifice and sprinkled the blood thereof on their heads, he said: 'As long as I am alive I shall not cease to worship you.' From this proceeding the Qoraish concluded that he had remained steadfast in unbelief and aberration. The idolaters thereon asked him how he had succeeded, and what he had effected in his business. But after Abu Sofy\u00e2n had narrated everything, they said: 'Thou hast done nothing and hast accomplished nothing. Thou hast neither brought news of war,\nthat we may prepare for it and be ready, nor of peace, that we may sit down comfortably in our houses. A'li, the son of Abu Tt\u00e2leb, has made fun of thee by instructing thee to afford protection, and to give quarter on both sides.'\n\nAfter Abu Sofy\u00e2n had departed from Madinah with the intention to go to Mekkah, his lordship the apostle began to make preparations for an expedition to Mekkah, and informed Ssiddyq the greater of his purpose, with the injunction to reveal it to no one, and uttered with his wonderfully eloquent tongue the following words with reference to the Qoraish: 'O God, blind their eyes, so that they may not see us except suddenly!' Then he despatched couriers to the encampments and the Arab tribes around Madinah, inviting them and every man who believed in the Lord of Glory and in the day of the resurrection to make his appearance in Madinah on the first day of the month Ramadzan perfectly ready and armed. He also ordered the companions to make preparations for the campaign, to get ready the arms and appliances of war; he also ordered that no pilgrims should go to Mekkah, lest they might convey to the Qoraish the news of the approach of the professors of Isl\u00e2m.\n\nMeanwhile, however, H\u00e1ttub B. Abu Ttoba'h wrote a letter to the Qoraish princes as follows: 'His holy and prophetic lordship is engaged in preparations for a campaign and collecting an army. Most likely the destination of his lordship is no other than Mekkah. I desired to oblige you, and have therefore indited this epistle. Farewell!' H\u00e1ttub had given this letter to a woman, who concealed it in her hair, and departed to Mekkah. Jebr\u00e2\u00eel having informed his lordship of this matter, he called A'li B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb, Zobayr B. Ala'ww\u00e2m, and O'mar Y\u00e2ser, to whom he said: 'Go as far as Raudzat Kh\u00e2kh, and there you will find a woman carrying a letter. Capture that woman and bring the letter.' When A'li the Commander of the Faithful and the other [two] companions arrived in Raudzat Kh\u00e2kh, they [found and] asked the woman for the letter, but she denied having one. Being unable to find it, they\nintended to return, but A'li, the son of Abu Ttaleb, exclaimed: 'I swear by God that the apostle of Allah has not told me an untruth.' He then drew his sword and threatened to kill the woman, and she, being frightened, pulled out the letter from its place of concealment and handed it to A'li, who carried it to his lordship. The latter immediately summoned H\u00e1ttub, and asked: 'What has led thee to this step?' H\u00e1ttub replied: 'O apostle of God, I swear by Allah that I believe in Him and His prophet, and that in this matter I have not changed or altered my religion, nor become a hypocrite! I am one of the confederates, but not of the clansmen of the Qoraish; and have no one in the sanctuary to take care of my family and of my property, contrary to all the refugees [Moh\u00e2jer] who are enrolled among thy companions, every one of whom has relatives in that country to take care of his possessions. My object in writing this letter was to oblige the Qoraish, so that the sight of that epistle might induce them not to forget to mind my family and property.' His lordship the prophet said to the companions: 'Be ye aware and know that H\u00e1ttub has told you the truth!' O'mar B. Alkhatt\u00e1b, however, turned to H\u00e1ttub, and said: 'May Allah slay thee! Hast thou written a letter to inform the Qoraish, despite thy being aware of the apostle's orders that the roads be watched, lest news of his approach might be divulged among the Qoraish?' Then F\u00e2ri\u00fbq [i.e., O'mar] said to the lord of termination: 'O apostle of God, allow me to strike off the head of this hypocrite!' But that prince appeased O'mar, saying: 'He was present at Bedr! And verily God has appeared to the combatants of Bedr, saying, \"Do what you like, and you will certainly be forgiven!\" According to another tradition, he added, \"and paradise is due to you,\" and the blessed chapter, \"O ye believers, do not consider my enemies and your enemies as your friends!\" till the end was revealed with reference to this matter.' In some biographical works we read that he ordered him to be expelled from the mosque, and that\n\n361 This is the beginning of ch. lx., entitled 'She who is tried.'\nseveral persons placed their hands on his back to push him out ignominiously. On that occasion the culprit looked piteously back at the blessed face of his lordship, and the latter said to the people: 'Turn him back!' And to him: 'I have pardoned thy crime. Ask God the Most High and Glorious to forgive thy transgression, and commit no such act another time.' It is related that H\u00e2ttub was one of the great Moh\u00e2jer companions, a learned and intelligent man, but that the above act had been committed by him through inadvertence. His lordship had sent him to Maqoqush, the Governor of Alexandria, as has been already mentioned above.\n\nThere is a tradition of H\u00e2ttub that he said: 'When I arrived in Alexandria, Maqoqush invited me one evening along with his magnates, and the following conversation ensued between us:\n\n'M.: Is thy master a prophet?\n'I: Yes; he is an apostle of God.\n'M.: Why did he not curse the Qoraish when they exiled him, that God the Most High should destroy them?\n'I: Was I'sa, the son of Maryam, a prophet?\n'M.: He was indeed an apostle.\n'I: Then why did he not curse his people when they took hold of him and desired to crucify him?\n'M.: Thou speakest the truth! Thou art a sage, and comest from a sage!'\n\nChroniclers relate that his lordship the apostle had determined to march to Mekkah, and had despatched Aysh\u00e1 B. Ruhdzah with Kalth\u00fbm B. Alyamyn for the purpose of enlisting troops, to the Bani Ghuff\u00e2r and Dhomayrah. He sent Moa'ql B. San\u00e2n and Na'yym B. Masu'd to invite the Shaja', and appointed A'bdu'llah B. O'mayr Mazany to call the tribe Mazynah. Hajj\u00e2j B. Ghull\u00e2t Solmy he sent to the Bani Solym and ordered A'ry\u00e2dz B. Sardar to go to the tribe Bani Ka'b, appointing Ebn Makt\u00fbm to be his own lieutenant in Madinah. Of the ladies, sitting in the apartments of piety and innocence, he selected Omm Solmah to enjoy the honour of accompanying him. According to a\ncertain tradition, he started from Madinah on the tenth of the month Ramadzan and made a halt near the well of Abu O\u2019baydah, where the victorious army was reviewed, and having been numbered, it was found to consist of seven hundred Moh\u00e1jer, who possessed three hundred horses. There were three standards; one being held by the victorious lion of God, A\u2019li Bin Abu Tt\u00e1leb\u2014u. w. b.\u2014the second by Zobayr B. Ala\u2019ww\u00e1m, and the third by Sa\u2019d B. Woqq\u00e1s. The number of Anss\u00e1r attached to the heaven-aspiring retinue amounted to four thousand, and they possessed five hundred horses. Of the Mazynah, one thousand men had arrived with one hundred cuirasses and one hundred horses. Of the people of Aslam four hundred men attained the felicity of combating for the religion, and of the Bani Ka\u2019b five hundred men were counted. According to another tradition, however, his lordship distributed the victorious standards in the station of Qadyr among the Moh\u00e1jer and Anss\u00e1r; in which place also nearly one thousand lancers of the Bani Solym, most of whom were mounted on horses, joined the army of Isl\u00e1m. Also a great number of combatants from other tribes, the mention whereof would only lengthen this narrative, enjoyed the happiness of accompanying the lord of apostleship.\n\nA\u2019bb\u00e1s B. A\u2019bd-ul-Muttalleb, who had with his family, children and property, departed from Mekkah for the purpose of emigrating, was honoured by being allowed to kiss the blessed fingers of the apostle of God, who was delighted to meet him, told him to send his baggage back to Mekkah, but himself to remain, and said: \u2018This is thy last emigration in the same way as my prophetship is the last.\u2019 During the march, Abu Sofy\u00e1n B. Alh\u00e0reth B. A\u2019bd-ul-Muttalleb and A\u2019bdullah E. Ommyah Almoghyrah, the former of whom was the son of the apostle\u2019s uncle, and the latter of his aunt, waited on his lordship, who first reproached them\u2014because while he was yet in Mekkah these two relatives had insulted him much\u2014but as his august nature was disposed for mercy and liberality, he at last took them into the shadow of his protection and mercy.\nIt is related that Abu Sofy\u00e2n B. Alh\u00e2reth was not only a cousin, but also the milk-brother of his lordship, but when he received his mission, Abu Sofy\u00e2n became unfriendly, manifested enmity, and derided the apostle of God as well as his noble companions. On a certain occasion the Musalm\u00e2ns of Madinah asked Has\u00e2n B. Th\u00e2bet to deride Abu Sofy\u00e2n likewise in return, but Has\u00e2n replied: \u2018I cannot do that without the permission of the apostle of God;\u2019 and when he requested the latter to grant him license to do so, he replied: \u2018How could I allow thee to insult my brother and cousin?\u2019 Despite this kindness, Abu Sofy\u00e2n B. Alh\u00e2reth made in all his battles common cause with Abu Sofy\u00e2n B. Harb and the Qoraish; nor did he omit to do anything which might injure his lordship. Afterwards he went to Greece and obtained an audience of the Qayssar [i.e., Byzantine emperor], who asked him: \u2018Who art thou?\u2019 He replied: \u2018I am Abu Sofy\u00e2n B. H\u00e2reth B. A\u2019bd-ul-Muttalleb.\u2019 The Qayssar continued: \u2018If thou speakest the truth thou art the son of A\u2019bd-ul-Muttalleb, the uncle of Muhammad B. A\u2019bdullah.\u2019 Then Abu Sofy\u00e2n thought within himself: \u2018Though I have fled from Isl\u00e2m, have made this great journey, and have arrived in Greece, where no one knows me, I am nevertheless not compared with anyone except with Muhammad.\u2019 The words of the Qayssar had, however, produced love for Isl\u00e2m in the heart of Abu Sofy\u00e2n. Therefore he returned from Greece, and met, with his family and children, the army of Isl\u00e2m, in the station of Abu\u00e2bah, where he attempted several times to obtain an interview with the apostle of God, but the latter was estranged from him, and when the Musalm\u00e2ns perceived this, they were likewise estranged from him. Some of them even insulted him, and Abu Sofy\u00e2n, being greatly distressed, approached his lordship with humility and contrition, excited his pity, and was received into favour. Some allege that at the intercession of Omm Solmah his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014pardoned the crimes of Ebnu-l-h\u00e2reth and of A\u2019bdullah Abu Ommyah.\nAuthentic reports have it that when his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014arrived and halted in Mar\u00e2 Al-tzahr\u00e2n, which is at a distance of four farsangs from Mekkah, his lordship ordered during that night as many fires to be kindled in the camp as there were combatants, so that according to the tradition recording the smallest number, at least ten thousand men were present in the heaven-aspiring retinue of the lord Muhammad\u2014u. w. b.\n\nThe Qoraish knew nothing of the approach of his lordship, but they repented of what they had done, and feared his vengeance immensely. Meanwhile Abu Sofy\u00e2n B. Harb, Hodhayl B. Warq\u00e2 and Hakym B. Huz\u00e2m had sallied out from Mekkah to reconnoitre. It is recorded in the Raudzatu-l-\u0101hb\u00e2b that when the army of Isl\u00e2m halted in Mar\u00e2 Al-tzahr\u00e2n it consisted, according to one tradition, of ten, and according to another of twelve thousand men, every one of whom had that night been ordered by his lordship to kindle a fire. Up to that time the Qoraish knew nothing of the intention of the prophet, but they were under great apprehensions, because they suspected that his lordship would march against them. Therefore they said to Abu Sofy\u00e2n: \u2018Go thou out to reconnoitre, and if thou encounterest Muhammad ask him for a truce.\u2019 But the writer of these pages says that this condition must not be insisted on [to have been made by all the Qoraish] because in the Raudzatu-l-\u0101hb\u00e2b, as well as in all the other biographical works, it is recorded that after Abu Sofy\u00e2n had returned to Mekkah, and had brought the news of the truce, the princes of the Qoraish, such as Akramah B. Abu Jahl and Ssafuw\u00e2n B. Ommyah fought a great battle against the army of Isl\u00e2m, as shall be narrated in these pages, if it pleaseth God the Most High. According to the injunction of the idolaters to Abu Sofy\u00e2n to ask for a truce, and after his obtaining it by his skill in negotiation, it is not likely that a conflict with the army of Isl\u00e2m would have taken place, nor do any of the biographical works, which have come under the notice of the author of these pages, mention this condition. Allah, however, is most wise.\nThe arrangers of the gems of information have strung the pearls of words on the thread of eloquence as follows: When A\u2019bb\u00e1s B. A\u2019bd-ul-Muttalleb beheld the multitude of fires which had been kindled at Mar\u00e0 Al-tzahr\u00e1n, he exclaimed: \u2018Woe will betide the Qoraish if the lord of apostleship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014enters Mekkah in wrath, not granting them quarter. Verily, if this takes place, the Qoraish will be extirpated, and no trace of them will remain.\u2019 After this apprehension had overwhelmed his luminous mind, he mounted the private mule of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and went to a place called Arakah, hoping to meet a wood-carrier or a milk-seller going to Mekkah, to send information concerning the state of affairs. While he was continuing his journey towards the honoured sanctuary in order to save the denizens thereof from the tempest of the sea of enmity, and to pilot them to the shore of pacification, by inducing them to sue for quarter, and thus to save themselves from the calamity of being slain by the professors of the Faith, Abu Sofy\u00e2n and his companions, who had been despatched to reconnoitre, happened to arrive near Mar\u00e0 Al-tzahr\u00e1n, and to observe the fires of the professors of Isl\u00e2m from an eminence. This spectacle confused them, and Abu Sofy\u00e2n said to Hodhayl B. Warq\u00e2: \u2018We have never seen such fires, nor heard of such an army.\u2019 Hodhayl replied: \u2018These are the Khozaa\u2019h people, who have collected an army, and who have lit the fires of battle.\u2019 Abu Sofy\u00e2n rejoined: \u2018I swear by Allah that the Bani Khozaa\u2019h are less in number, and that this fire and army cannot be theirs.\u2019 Meanwhile A\u2019bbas [came up], recognised the voice of Abu Sofy\u00e2n in this conversation, and exclaimed: \u2018O father of Hanttalah.\u2019 The former, also knowing the voice of the latter, said: \u2018This is the father of Fadzl.\u2019 A\u2019bb\u00e1s replied: \u2018Yes.\u2019 Abu Sofy\u00e2n continued: \u2018May my father and mother be a sacrifice for thee! What event is this?\u2019 A\u2019bbas replied: \u2018Woe to thee! This is the apostle of God with ten thousand men, and woe to the Qoraish! But:\nAbu Sofy\u00e2n replied: 'What is the use of reproaches? If thou canst aid us, do so. What is the remedy in this emergency?' A'bb\u00e2s continued: 'By Allah! if the apostle of God obtains the victory, he will order thy head to be struck off, despite the meekness, generosity, and forgiveness peculiar to him. The remedy is, that thou bestride this mule in my rear, to enable me to convey thee into the assembly of the lord of prophecy\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and to ask quarter for thee.' Abu Sofy\u00e2n rode the mule as he had been told, whereon Hodhayl returned with Hakym to Mekkah. When A'bb\u00e2s passed through the camp, the men near each fire rose and said: 'Who can this man be that passes at this unseasonable time?' After, however, looking well at him, they said: 'This is the uncle of the prophet who is riding the mule of his lordship, and is passing by.' When A'bb\u00e2s reached the tent of O'mar B. Alkhatt\u00e2b, the latter said nothing, although a big fire was near; but after A'bb\u00e2s had passed, his eye alighted on Abu Sofy\u00e2n, whom he recognised. Accordingly he leapt up, shouting: 'O enemy of God, praise be to Allah for having allowed thee to fall into my hands, without their being tied by truce or quarter.' After uttering these words he drew his sabre, beginning to run, and intending to obtain permission from his lordship to slay Abu Sofy\u00e2n before the arrival of A'bb\u00e2s. The latter, however, guessing the intention of O'mar, likewise arrived immediately after him, and O'mar spoke as follows: 'O apostle of God, behold, Abu Sofy\u00e2n has fallen into our grasp without [obtaining] a safe-conduct or [making] the profession of the Faith. I crave permission to sever his head from his body.' A'bb\u00e2s, however, interposed, saying: 'O apostle of God, I have granted quarter to Abu Sofy\u00e2n, and have taken him under my protection.' O'mar nevertheless advanced to whisper something into his lordship's ear; but A'bb\u00e2s forestalled him, and, embracing the blessed head of the apostle of God, said: 'This night we shall not tell him anything insulting.' And after O'mar\nhad made several efforts more to kill Abu Sofy\u00e0n, A\u2019bb\u00e2s said: \u2018O\u2019mar, thou art so very anxious to slay him because he is one of the Bani A\u2019bd Men\u00e2f. Had he been of the Bani A\u2019dy, thou wouldst not have been so pressing.\u2019 O\u2019mar rejoined: \u2018O A\u2019bb\u00e2s, do not say that, because on the day thou hast become a Musalm\u00e2n thy profession of Isl\u00e2m had made thee dearer to me than my own father Khatt\u00e2b.\u2019 After the contention between O\u2019mar and A\u2019bb\u00e2s had become protracted to some length, his holy and prophetic lordship pacified them, saying: \u2018A\u2019bb\u00e2s, let Abu Sofy\u00e0n remain this night with thee, and bring him to me in the morning.\u2019 Accordingly, when the world-illuminating sun had lit up the inhabited quarter of the globe, like the caskets of the hearts of believers, A\u2019bb\u00e2s brought Abu Sofy\u00e0n into the assembly of the lord of apostleship\u2014u.w.b.\u2014who exclaimed: \u2018Woe to thee, O Abu Sofy\u00e0n! Has not the time arrived for thee to know that no image is worthy of adoration but God the Most High and Glorious?\u2019 Abu Sofy\u00e0n said: \u2018May my father and mother be a sacrifice for thee! How great must be thy gentleness, liberality, and good nature, that, despite the insults and persecutions I have heaped upon thee, thou nevertheless treatest me so kindly! I know that there is no other God but the Most High, because if there were one he might have helped us now!\u2019 His lordship continued: \u2018Has not the time arrived for thee to know that I am the prophet of God?\u2019 Abu Sofy\u00e0n replied: \u2018Heretofore I had some doubt of it in my mind.\u2019 But A\u2019bb\u00e2s interrupted him, saying: \u2018Woe to thee, Abu Sofy\u00e0n! Make no long speeches, but pronounce the formula of monotheism, or else O\u2019mar will immediately step in and despatch thee with his scimitar.\u2019 Then Abu Sofy\u00e0n uttered, nolens volens, the words: \u2018I testify that there is no God but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is the apostle of Allah.\u2019 According to the tradition of W\u00e2q\u00eedi, Abu Sofy\u00e0n was that night admitted to an audience, in which he remained standing, and his lordship said to him: \u2018Woe to thee, Abu Sofy\u00e0n! Has the time not arrived for thee to bear witness that there is but\none God, and that I am His apostle?' Abu Sofy\u00e2n replied: 'How kind thou art, O father of Q\u00e2sim; how meek and good-natured! As to the matter that there is but one God, I believe it; for had there been another besides Him he would have helped us on the day of Bedr and of Ohod. But as to thy being the apostle of Allah, I swear by Him that I have something in my mind.' Then A'bb\u00e2s exclaimed: 'By Allah! he is the apostle of God, and he will immediately order thee to be killed, except thou bearest witness that there is but one God, and that Muhammad is His prophet.' Then Abu Sofy\u00e2n became a Musalm\u00e2n. Waqidi also relates that during the said night A'bb\u00e2s took Abu Sofy\u00e2n to his own dwelling, by order of his holy and prophetic lordship. In the morning, when Ball\u00e2l proclaimed the matutinal prayers and the shouts of the army of Isl\u00e2m, who seconded him, were heard by Abu Sofy\u00e2n, he was troubled, and asked A'bb\u00e2s what voices these were. He replied that they were a call to prayers. Abu Sofy\u00e2n then asked: 'How many prayers do you hold during one day and night?' A'bb\u00e2s replied: 'Five.' Abu Sofy\u00e2n exclaimed: 'I swear by Allah that this is much.' In some traditions we read that when the morning dawned, and Ball\u00e2l called the people to prayers, a commotion took place, and Abu Sofy\u00e2n, thinking that they were in search of him, asked Abb\u00e2s: 'What is the matter?' A'bb\u00e2s replied: 'This is a movement for prayers.' When the professors of Isl\u00e2m were at their orisons with the apostle of God, Abu Sofy\u00e2n said: 'Whatever Muhammad does the people are likewise doing.' A'bb\u00e2s replied: 'Yes; and I imagine they will destroy thy people to morrow.' A'bb\u00e2s relates that when Abu Sofy\u00e2n beheld the Musalm\u00e2ns, on the occasion of the apostle's\u2014u. w. b.\u2014performing his religious ablution, holding out their hands for the water [falling from Muhammad], and smearing it on their heads and faces for a blessing, he said: 'I swear by Allah that I have never seen the Qayssar or the Kesra enjoy such honour.' In short, after Abu Sofy\u00e2n had become a Musalm\u00e2n, A'bb\u00e2s said: 'O apostle of God, Abu Sofy\u00e2n is a man\nfond of dignity and pomp. Appoint him to something, that he may be exalted and honoured among the Qoraish.' Thereon his lordship replied: 'Whoever enters the house of Abu Sofy\u00e2n will be safe; whoever throws away his arms will be safe; whoever locks his door will be safe; and whoever enters the mosque of the sanctuary will be safe.' Muhammad E. Esah\u00e2q relates that when his lordship said, 'Whoever enters the house of Abu Sofy\u00e2n shall be safe,' Abu Sofy\u00e2n replied: 'My house is not large enough.' Then that prince said: 'And whoever enters the Ka\u2019bah shall be safe.' Abu Sofy\u00e2n continued: 'The Ka\u2019bah is not large enough.' Then his lordship said: 'Whoever locks his door will be secure.' Abu Sofy\u00e2n exclaimed: 'That is large enough.' And when he had departed to Mekkah, with the permission of his holy and prophetic lordship, A\u2019bb\u00e2s spoke to the apostle of God as follows: 'Abu Sofy\u00e2n has not seen the army of Isl\u00e2m fully and completely, so as to become impressed by its strength, and I fear when he returns to Mekkah he will become a traitor and offer resistance; therefore I think it will be proper to retain him in this place, that he may behold the glorious army with its arrangements, and be awed by seeing the defenders of Isl\u00e2m.' His lordship approved of this advice, and said to Abb\u00e1s: 'Overtake Abu Sofy\u00e2n, and detain him in a narrow spot, that the army of God may pass in review before him.' Accordingly A\u2019bb\u00e2s hastened after Abu Sofy\u00e2n, and when he was near him he shouted: 'O father of Hanttalah!' Having become suspicious, Abu Sofy\u00e2n asked: 'O ye Bani H\u00e2shem, are you harbouring treachery in your minds?' A\u2019bb\u00e2s replied: 'The adherents of prophets are no traitors, and I want thee merely to halt in a place to see the army of God march with their weapons, accoutrements, and appliances of war, which they have in readiness to attack the enemies and opponents and to punish the idolaters.' A\u2019bb\u00e2s then took Abu Sofy\u00e2n to a narrow passage, whereon his lordship issued orders to the troops to array themselves in the same way as they had started from Madinah, and to march by him in separate\nbattalions. The first brigade which passed was that of Kh\u00e2led B. Wolyd, with one thousand men of the Bani Solym, who considered the battle-field to be a joyous assembly, and imagined that a day of fighting was like a night of wedding. In that brigade there were two standards, one being held by A\u2019bb\u00e2s B. Mard\u00e2sy, and the other by one of the companions. When Abu Sofy\u00e2n beheld them, he asked A\u2019bb\u00e2s: \u2018Who are these?\u2019 and the latter replied: \u2018Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd.\u2019 Abu Sofy\u00e2n continued by way of slight, \u2018What! this youth?\u2019 Abb\u00e2s said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 When Kh\u00e2led arrived opposite to Abu Sofy\u00e2n, he uttered the Takbyr thrice in a loud voice, and passed on. After Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd came Zobayr B. Ala\u2019ww\u00e2m with five hundred Arab heroes carrying a black standard. When this legion arrived near Abu Sofy\u00e2n it likewise shouted the Takbyr, and he asked A\u2019bb\u00e2s: \u2018Who is the general of this battalion?\u2019 The latter replied: \u2018Zobayr.\u2019 Abu Sofy\u00e2n asked: \u2018The son of thy sister?\u2019 Abb\u00e2s said: \u2018Yes.\u2019 After Zobayr came three hundred men of the Bani Ghuff\u00e2r, and their banner was carried by Abu Dhar Ghuff\u00e2ry. When they passed near Abu Sofy\u00e2n they shouted the Takbyr as before. He questioned A\u2019bbas concerning them, and received the information he wanted. Then the Bani Ka\u2019b B. A\u2019mru arrived, who possessed five hundred celebrated troopers, and their flag was carried by Bashyr B. Sofy\u00e2n. When Abu Sofy\u00e2n asked about the name and fame of that company, he said: \u2018They are the confederates of Muhammad\u2014u. w. b.\u2019 When the Bani Ka\u2019b had likewise marched by, shouting the Takbyr, one thousand of the tribe Mazynah arrived with three standards, and when Abu Sofy\u00e2n recognised his own tribe, he said: \u2018I have nothing to do with them.\u2019 After that the people of Jahannyah arrived, and were followed by three hundred men of the Shuja\u2019 with one standard. Then came the Bani Leith, the Bani Hamzah, and the Bani Sa\u2019d B. Bakr. When A\u2019bbas informed Abu Sofy\u00e2n about the Shuja\u2019, the latter said: \u2018Of all the Arabs, these people have been the greatest enemies of Muhammad.\u2019 To his remark Abbas replied: \u2018But God the Most High\nand Glorious has inspired them with love for Isl\u00e2m, which was a favour and a benefit from the Boundless Giver.' Abu Sofy\u00e2n then said: 'O father of Fadzl, it seems Muhammad has not yet passed.' A'bb\u00e2s replied: 'No; and if thou beholdest the imposing train in the midst whereof the lord of apostleship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014is, thou wilt be convinced that no one can resist his army.' According to another tradition, Abu Sofy\u00e2n asked A'bb\u00e2s about every tribe which passed, and, after receiving information, he said: 'I have nothing to do with them.' When the forces had marched by, the august cavalcade of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014appeared all of a sudden, consisting of nearly five thousand celebrated and noble Moh\u00e2jer and Anss\u00e2r.\n\nVerses: They had Davidian cuirasses on their breasts,\nAnd flint-splitting scimitars at their sides.\nAll had lances from Khatt,\nAll had Indian swords,\nRiding Arab horses and camels;\nEvery one of them was a hero of his time,\nA hundred times more brave than Rustam or Esfendy\u00e2r.\n\nAbu Bakr Ssiddyq rode on one side of his lordship, and on the other Asyd B. Khadzyr, with both of whom he was conversing. The eyes of Abu Sofy\u00e2n, who had beheld the magnificence and numbers of the army of Isl\u00e2m, being dazzled, he said in his confusion to A'bb\u00e2s: 'I have never seen nor heard of an army as strong as this. O A'bb\u00e2s, the power of thy brother's son has become great!' A'bb\u00e2s replied: 'This is apostleship and prophecy, not kingdom and power!' It is related that on the said day Sa'd B. A'b\u00e2dah, who carried the standard of the Anss\u00e2r, preceded his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014with one thousand of them at a short distance, and that when they arrived opposite to Abu Sofy\u00e2n they shouted: 'Abu Sofy\u00e2n, this day! This day is the battle! This day the\n\n362 Qur\u00e2n, ch. xxi. 80. 'And we taught him [i.e., David] the art of making coats of mail for you.'\n363 Khatt is a certain place in Yamamah, and a port, where famous spears were manufactured.\n364 See Part I., vol. ii., of this series, pp. 234, 237.\nsanctuary will be delivered! This day Allah will humble the Qoraish!' Then they turned to their companions, exclaiming: 'O ye men of R\u00fbs and Khazraj! take vengeance this day for the battle of Ohod!' Abu Sofy\u00e2n said to A'bb\u00e2s: 'Joyful is the day of battle!' But when Sa'd B. A'b\u00e2dah had passed by after thus threatening Abu Sofy\u00e2n, his lordship the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014arrived with his intimate companions near Abu Sofy\u00e2n, who shouted: 'O apostle of God, hast thou issued orders that thy own people be slain?' His lordship said: 'No.' Abu Sofy\u00e2n continued: 'I hope God\u2014whose name be blessed and exalted\u2014and the consanguinity subsisting between thee and the Qoraish, will hinder thee from shedding their blood, and that thou wilt be kind and forgiving towards thy relatives; for, verily, thou art the most beneficent and compassionate of men!' His lordship replied: 'Sa'd has spoken those words heedlessly and wrongly. This day is a day of joy and mercy. This is the day on which God\u2014whose name be praised and exalted\u2014will cause the Qoraish to be honoured. To-day Allah the Most High and Glorious will increase the magnificence of the house of the Ka'bah by dressing it up with curtains.' O'thman B. O'ff\u00e2n and A'bdu-r-rahman A'wuf, however, replied: 'O apostle of God, we are not sure whether Sa'd will not inflict a calamity on the Qoraish.' The apostle of God thereon ordered Qays B. Sa'd to take the banner away from his father, and in some traditions it is related that he commanded A'li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014to take the standard from Sa'd B. A'b\u00e2dah.\n\nAfter all the Musalm\u00e2ns had defiled in front of Abu Sofy\u00e2n, some said to him: 'Now thou must go to Mekkah and intimidate the Qoraish to become Musalm\u00e2ns, so that they may be delivered from the grasp of death.' Abu Sofy\u00e2n then departed in the greatest haste to the sanctuary. On that day so much dust was raised by the quadrupeds of the victorious army, that it ascended higher than the tops of the mountains.\n\nThe conquest of Mekkah is narrated in the Raudzatu-l-\n\nvol. II.\n\u0101\u1e25b\u0101b as follows: The Qoraish were not cognisant of his lordship's approach, and when they beheld Abu Sofy\u0101n arriving in great haste, they met, and asked him: 'What is the news, and what is the cause of this dust?' He replied: 'Woe to you! Muhammad has arrived with a numerous army, clad in iron and steel, and most of his troopers are heroes whom no one can resist. He, nevertheless, has promised to spare the life of every man who enters my house, throws away his arms, or locks his dwelling, or takes refuge in the mosque of the sanctuary.' They replied: 'The curse of Allah be on thee! What news is this thou hast brought us?' When Hinda, the spouse of Abu Sofy\u0101n, who had come out to meet him, heard her husband speaking in the above manner, she lost her patience, took hold of his beard, reviled him, and shouted: 'O family of Gh\u0101leb, kill this old fool that he may not utter such words!' But Abu Sofy\u0101n replied: 'Insult me as you like, but I swear that you will be killed unless you profess the Faith. Return, therefore, to your houses, lock the door, and say nothing more.'\n\nIn the Raudzatu-l-\u0101\u1e25b\u0101b there is a statement [about the approach of the army of Isl\u0101m] which has been recorded above, but some of its portions are for their interest inserted in this place also [as follows]: When the army of Isl\u0101m had arrived in Mar\u0101 Al-tzahr\u0101n, which is four farsangs distant from Mekkah, it halted, and was found to consist of ten thousand, but according to another tradition of twelve thousand men, every one of whom his lordship ordered to light a fire that night. The Qoraish had till that time obtained no information about the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014but they were afraid, because they knew that he intended to go to Mekkah. They therefore despatched Abu Sofy\u0101n to reconnoitre, and told him, in case he should encounter Muhammad, to ask quarter for them. Abu Sofy\u0101n B. Harb, and Hakym B. Huz\u0101m, and Hodhayl B. Warq\u0101 left Mekkah, and advanced till they reached the top of a hill near Mar\u0101 Al-tzahr\u0101n, and perceived that the whole country was [as it were] on fire. After relating this scene,\nthe author of the *Raudzatu-l-\u0101hb\u0101b* states that there is a tradition of A'bb\u0101s B. A'bd-ul-Muttalleb that he said: 'When I perceived that night the fires at Mar\u00e2 Al-tzahr\u00e2n, I said to myself: If the prophet goes to Mekkah with this army, ere the Qoraish ask him for quarter they will be cut up, and will be annihilated. Accordingly I mounted his lordship's own private mule and proceeded as far as the place called Arak, my intention being to find either a wood-carrier, a milk-seller, or a beggar going to Mekkah, and to inform him of the state of affairs, so as to warn the inhabitants to consider their position. I, however, suddenly heard and recognised the voice of Abu Sofy\u0101n and Hodhayl conversing with each other, and exclaimed: \"O father of Hanttalah!\" He likewise knew my voice, and asked: \"Is this the father of Fadzl?\" I said: \"Yes.\" He continued: \"What are these fires, and to whom do they belong?\" I replied: \"Woe to thee! This is the apostle of God with ten thousand men.\" He queried: \"What is our remedy?\" I replied: \"Bestride this mule in my rear.\" Hodhayl and Hakym then returned to Mekkah, but Abu Sofy\u0101n, who had not yet become a Musalm\u00e2n, nor obtained quarter, stopped.' The author of these pages considers it strange that, although the writer of the *Raudzatu-l-\u0101hb\u0101b* had believed and recorded it in his work, that Hakym B. Huz\u0101m and Hodhayl B. Warq\u0101 had received information from A'bb\u0101s\u2014u. w. b.\u2014about the numbers of the army of Isl\u0101m, and the manner of the approach of the best of men, and had returned [with that information] to Mekkah, he nevertheless alleges that the Qoraish possessed no knowledge of his lordship's approach, and that when they beheld Abu Sofy\u0101n arriving in haste, they met him and asked: 'What is the news, and why this dust?' The author of these pages says that as the Qoraish had remained ignorant of the approach of the apostle of God, the tradition, according to which Hodhayl and Hakym were in the company of Abu Sofy\u0101n at Mar\u00e2 Al-tzahr\u0101n, and were also honoured by being admitted to kiss the carpet of his holy\nand prophetic lordship, will be the correct one. Allah, however, knows best the true state of the matter.\n\nIt is related that as the various detachments passed by Abu Sofy\u00e2n, they continued to march in the same manner till they arrived in Dhu Ttawa, where they halted till the apostle of God arrived with the principal Moh\u00e1jer and Anss\u00e2r. When the blessed eyes of his lordship scanned that great army assembled under his victorious banners, he remembered his unhappy and forlorn condition at the time of his Flight; and having placed his august forehead on the cover upon the back of his camel, he offered, mounted as he was, the prostration of gratitude, saying: \u2018Thanks be to the Lord, who conveys me after a short time with so numerous and brave an army to Mekkah, to conquer it and to govern it!\u2019 After that he ordered Zobayr to march into Mekkah from its upper portion, and the standard belonging to his lordship to be conveyed to the Haj\u00fbn, but no further, till he joined it in person. That prince also ordered Kh\u00e2led B. Wolyd to march into Mekkah with the battalions of Aslam and Ghuff\u00e2ry, with all the heroes of the age, from the lower portion thereof, whilst he himself proceeded with a company of his intimate friends by another route to the place of their destination. Orders were also issued that no individual be allowed to insult or to attack the inhabitants of the sacred city in any manner whatever; but in the event of any heedless or shameless persons daring to assail the victorious army, they were to be repelled and restrained in a composed and quiet way.\n\nIt is related that when Akramah B. Abu Jahl, and Ssafluw\u00e1n B. Ommyah, and Sohayl B. A\u2019mru heard of the approach of Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd, they made, with a number of valiant men of the Bani Bakr, of the Bani Alh\u00e2reth, and of the Bani Hazyl, preparations for attacking him, and hastened to meet him. The two opposing parties actually encountered each other in a place called Ja\u2019dyah, came to blows, and continued fighting till they reached Harurah, which is near the sacred mosque, where twenty-eight of the opponents were sent to hell by the scimitars of the com-\nbatants for the religion, and ten men of the battalion of Kh\u00e2led tasted the beverage of martyrdom.\n\nEbn Hanttalah, who was a celebrated champion among the idolaters, rushed, protected by a cuirass and helmet, on a fleet horse, like an iron mountain, towards the camp of Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd; but when he reached the place called Ja\u2019dyah and beheld the army of Isl\u00e2m, he was overpowered by fear, and all his limbs quaked. He alighted from his courser, threw away his helmet with his cuirass, and ran till he arrived on the threshold of the Ka\u2019bah. Another company of heretics fled to the tops of the mountains, to which the Musalm\u00e2ns pursued them. On that occasion Abu Sofy\u00e2n and Hakym B. Huz\u00e2m exclaimed: \u2018O ye Qoraish people, do not carelessly expose yourselves to be killed. Every one who enters his house will be safe, and every one who throws away his arms will be safe.\u2019 Accordingly the idolaters threw away their weapons and took refuge in their houses, the Musalm\u00e2ns collecting the arms for their own use. Meanwhile the prince of former and of latter times arrived at Thabyah, which is near the sanctuary, and, perceiving a cloud of dust, he asked about the cause of it, and was told that it arose from Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd\u2019s battle with the idolaters. When the opponents had been put to flight, Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd was admitted to the honour of foot-osculation; and when his lordship reminded him of the prohibition to fight, he replied: \u2018They first attacked us, and we were obliged to defend ourselves.\u2019 His lordship was satisfied with the reply.\n\nIn some traditions it is recorded that when the apostle of God arrived in Mekkah it was brought to his notice that Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd, having unsheathed the scimitar of vengeance, was engaged in slaying the people. His lordship therefore called one of his friends, and said: \u2018Go and tell Kh\u00e2led to cease killing the inhabitants.\u2019 But when the messenger reached Kh\u00e2led, he said [on the contrary]: \u2018The orders of the apostle of God to thee are to attack them with the sword, and to grant quarter to no one.\u2019 Therefore Kh\u00e2led slew on that day seventy of the opponents. It is\nrelated that when Kh\u00e2led was admitted to kiss the most noble and exalted carpet, his holy and prophetic lordship \u2014u. w. b.\u2014asked: 'Why hast thou acted contrary to my orders, after I had sent thee a messenger to stop the slaughter?' Kh\u00e2led replied: 'O apostle of God, thy messenger told me to destroy them with the sword.' His lordship then summoned the courier, and asked: 'What have I told thee?' He replied: 'Thou hast said, \"Order Kh\u00e2led to cease to slay.\"' I was about to utter these words, when I perceived a man whose head touched the sky, but whose feet were on the ground. He had a dagger in his hand, which he placed on my breast, saying: \"Tell Kh\u00e2led to work among them with the sword, and if thou obeyest not I shall kill thee with this poniard.\"' Hereon the apostle of God exclaimed: 'Allah is true, and His apostle is true. On the day when my uncle Hamzah was killed I said: \"If I vanquish the Qoraish I will slay seventy of them.\" On that day God the Most High and Glorious prohibited me from retaliating in this manner; but to-day He wanted to fulfil the words of His apostle.'\n\nIt is related that his lordship had ordered his private tent to be pitched on the Haj\u00fbn, and that his companions obeyed. When his lordship entered it he washed his head and body from dust. After that he bathed, donned his cuirass, put on his helmet, mounted a camel, and rode to the sacred mosque. On his right hand rode Ssiddyq Akbar [i.e., Abu Bakr], and on his left Asyd B. Khadzyr, with Ball\u00e2l B. Ry\u00e2h and O'thm\u00e2n B. Ttolhah, all of whom attended on the heaven-aspiring stirrup. Muhammad B. Moslamah was leading by the bridle the camel of his lordship, who recited the Surah 'Verily we have granted thee a manifest victory,'\\(^{365}\\) They reached the sanctuary in this manner, his lordship arriving therein without opposition. Having illuminated the sacred mosque with the light of his presence, he touched the black stone with his crooked staff, and opened his wonderfully eloquent mouth by shouting the Takbyr, wherein the army of Isl\u00e2m joined\n\n\\(^{365}\\) Quran, ch. xlviii. 1.\nhim. This exclamation inspired with fear the young and the old among the Qoraish, who were contemplating the army of Isl\u00e2m from the tops of the mountains. After having completed the ceremony of circumambulating the Ka\u2019bah, his lordship alighted and purified the Ka\u2019bah from idols. Biographical works are filled with the accounts of this proceeding, and [with the narrative] that three hundred and sixty idols, the greatest whereof was Hobal, had been erected by the idolaters around the Ka\u2019bah. In some copies we read that Eblis had fixed the bases of all these idols underground with lead, but that, nevertheless, when the apostle of Allah touched them with the lance or stick he had in his hands, and uttered the words: \u2018Truth has come, and falsehood has departed,\u2019 the idols fell on their faces at the mere touch of the staff. It is said that on this day every idol which happened to be in the houses of the polytheists of Mekkah fell to the ground. On that occasion the lord of apostleship ordered A\u2019li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014to throw down Hobal, and to break to pieces As\u00e2f and N\u00e2ylah.\n\nAccording to another tradition, As\u00e2f had been erected in Ssana\u2019a, but N\u00e2ylah on [Mount] Marwah. As\u00e2f B. A\u2019mru had been a man of the tribe of Jorham, and N\u00e2ylah, the daughter of Sohayl, also belonged to that tribe. They had committed adultery with each other in the [very] house of the Ka\u2019bah, and therefore God the Most High had changed them into stone. The Qoraish, however, actually adored these two statues in their complete folly and aberration. When these two idols were broken a nude black woman issued from one of them, whereon his holy and prophetic lordship said: \u2018This is N\u00e2ylah. But she will never any more be worshipped in your country.\u2019 There is a tradition ascribed to A\u2019bdullah B. A\u2019bb\u00e2s\u2014u. w. b.\u2014that whenever his lordship pointed on that day to the face of an idol, the same immediately fell on its back, and whenever he pointed to the back it fell on its face. It is an authentic report that the Mekkans had placed several large idols in a high place, which could not be reached with the hands, and that when his lordship the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014entered the house\nof the Ka'bah with A'li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and perceived the idols, A'li said: 'O apostle of God, place thy blessed foot on my shoulder and bring down the idols.' His holy and prophetic lordship, however, replied: 'O A'li, thou canst not bear the weight of prophecy. Place thy foot on my shoulder, and undertake this business.' A'li obeyed, and when his foot was on the shoulder of the apostle of God\u2014u. w. b.\u2014the latter asked: 'A'li, how feelest thou?' A'li replied: 'I feel as if all obstacles had vanished, and as if my head were touching the leg of the throne of God, and that I could attain any object to which I stretch forth my hand.' His lordship asked: 'O A'li, hast thou reached what thou hast wished?' A'li replied: 'I swear by that God who has sent thee in truth, that I fancy, if I wished, I could touch the sky with my hand.' It is related that after A'li had thrown down the idols, he sprang from his lordship's back to the ground and smiled. His lordship having asked him for the cause of his hilarity, he replied: 'Because I have jumped from a high place, and feel no pain.' His lordship asked: 'O A'li, how couldst thou feel pain, since Muhammad has lifted thee up, and Jebr\u00e2\u00eel has taken thee down?' On the day when Hobal was broken, Zobayr B. Ala'ww\u00e2m said to Abu Sofy\u00e2n: 'The idol of Hobal to which thou hast prayed, and of which thou hast boasted on the day of Ohod, is broken.' Abu Sofy\u00e2n replied: 'Let me alone, and do not blame me, for this would not have happened if Muhammad had another partner in deity.'\n\nIt is related that the key of the house of the Ka'bah was with Soll\u00e2fah, the daughter of Sa'd, some of whose sons had been slain in the battle of Ohod, as has been narrated above; and when his lordship stayed in the sacred mosque he said to Ball\u00e2l: 'Go to O'thm\u00e2n B. Ttolhah, whose mother is Soll\u00e2fah, and tell him to bring the key of the Ka'bah.' O'thm\u00e2n accordingly went to his mother and asked for the key, but Soll\u00e2fah hesitated to surrender it, saying: 'If they take the key from you, they will never surrender it again.' O'thm\u00e2n, however, expostulated with\nhis mother; and as he did not return for a long time, his lordship despatched Ssiddyq and F\u00e2ri\u00fbq to bring the key. They obeyed, but stopped at the door of the house, where O\u2019mar exclaimed: \u2018O\u2019thm\u00e2n, come out; the apostle of God is waiting.\u2019 When Soll\u00e2fah knew on what errand Abu Bakr and O\u2019mar had come, she said to O\u2019thm\u00e2n: \u2018Take the key, my son, and give it to them. For it is better that thou take it than Yatym and A\u2019dy.\u2019 By these two names Soll\u00e2fah alluded to the genealogy of Ssiddyq, which ended with Yatym, and that of F\u00e2r\u00fbq, which ascended to A\u2019dy. After O\u2019thm\u00e2n had received the key from his mother, he carried it to the mosque of the sanctuary, and the apostle of God stretched out his hand to take it from him. A\u2019bb\u00e2s B. A\u2019bd-ul-Muttalleb, however, rose and said: \u2018O apostle of God, as thou hast appointed me to be superintendent of the Zamzam, bestow upon me also the chamberlainship of the Ka\u2019bah.\u2019 When O\u2019thm\u00e2n heard these words he hesitated to give up the key. His lordship then said: \u2018Give the key to me;\u2019 and O\u2019thm\u00e2n still vacillated, drawing back his hand again, when A\u2019bbas repeated his request. His holy and prophetic lordship hereon exclaimed: \u2018O\u2019thm\u00e2n, if thou believest in God the Most High and Glorious and in the day of judgment, thou wilt give the key to me.\u2019 Then O\u2019thm\u00e2n said: \u2018Here it is. Take it, O trustee [of the house] of God.\u2019 After that they opened the door of the house; his lordship the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014entered it and performed his devotions.\n\nIn several biographical works it is recorded that when the door of the Ka\u2019bah was opened the apostle of God entered it, and after praying with two flexions he took his position on the threshold of the house, touching with his hands both the doorposts and also holding the key, and that on this occasion A\u2019li the Commander of the Faithful advanced a few steps, saying: \u2018O apostle of God, bestow the chamberlainship of the house on a member of thy family in the same way as thou hast done with the superintendence of\n\n---\n\nThe word is *Hej\u00e2ba*, implying the possession of the key and control of the Ka\u2019bah. See note 64.\nthe [well] Zamzam.' Then his lordship called O'thm\u00e2n, and said: 'Take the key of the Ka'bah, for this day is a day of beneficence and fidelity.' Some allege that his lordship spoke [to O'thm\u00e2n] as follows: 'Take it, ye sons of Ttolhah, and keep it for ever and ever. No one shall deprive you thereof, except by way of injustice.' Commentators and biographers are of opinion that on this occasion the verse 'Verily Allah commandeth you to restore the deposits to whom they belong' was revealed. Some, however, have another tradition about the taking of the key; but as the author of this work desires brevity, he has been satisfied with the mention of one only. The U'lam\u00e2 of biographies narrate that on this occasion, when his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had taken hold of the two doorposts, the majority of the chiefs of the Qoraish and grandees of Mekkah stood in lines around the Ka'bah, waiting for orders concerning themselves, whereon that prince uttered the following words with his pearl-dropping lips: 'Praise be to Allah, who has fulfilled His promise.' But according to another tradition he said: 'There is no God but Allah only, who has no partner. He has fulfilled His promise and aided His servant.' According to another tradition, he said: 'He aided His army, and disappointed the confederates. Allah has warded off [the companions of] the elephants [formerly] from Mekkah, and has [now] appointed over it His apostle and His faithful people.' After that he asked the inhabitants of Mekkah: 'What say you, and what think you of me?' They replied: 'We speak well and we think well of thee, O noble brother and son of a noble brother. Verily thou hast obtained power over us.' There being no allusion to the story of Yusuf [Joseph] in the reply of the Mekkans, his lordship said: 'I tell you what my brother Yusuf said: \"Let there be no reproach cast on you this day. Allah forgiveth you, because He is the most merciful of those who show\n\n367 Qur\u00e2n, ch. iv. 61. Rodwell translates the verse thus: 'Verily, God enjoineth you to give back your trusts to their owners,' etc.\nmercy.\" He also said: \"Depart, for ye are free.\" Then he preached a very eloquent and rhetorical sermon. Although he was not a writer, he drew the pen of abrogation over the customs and usages of [pre-Islamic] ignorance, and abolished the arduous decrees concerning retaliation and blood mulets, as well as the claims [for ransom] current before the promulgation of Isl\u00e2m, saying: 'Every claim for blood and property made in the time of ignorance is [now] placed under my foot, and I abolish it, except the service of the Ka'bah and the purveyorship of the pilgrims.' He also said: 'O ye Qoraish, God the Most High and Glorious has deprived you of the boast of ignorance, and of the pride and glorification wherewith ye domineered over other men. Abandon your haughtiness, for all men and sons of Adam are made of clay. They are brothers, and enjoy no advantage over each other, except according to their [respective] piety and abstinence.' Then he recited the verse: 'O ye men, verily we have created you male and female, and have made you peoples and tribes that you may know each other. Verily he of you who is most pious is most honoured in the sight of Allah. For Allah is wise and knowing.' When the time of the matutinal prayers was at hand his holy and prophetic lordship ordered Ball\u00e2l to mount to the top of the Ka'bah and to proclaim it. When the idolaters heard the voice of Ball\u00e2l, some of them, such as Hesh\u00e2m, the brother of Abu Jahl, and Hukm B. Ala'ass, uttered improper sentiments; but Abu Sofy\u00e2n B. Harb, who was present, said: 'I say nothing, but I believe that if I speak one word this gravel will not report it to Muhammad.' Jebr\u00e2\u00eel, however, descended, and informed the apostle of God concerning the assemblage of that company, whereon his lordship summoned those men, and repeated to every one of them what he had said. They were confused, but uttered the formula of monotheism, and Abu Sofy\u00e2n exclaimed: 'As for myself, O apostle of God, I have said nothing.' And the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014laughed.\n\n308 Qur\u00e2n, ch. xii. 92. 309 Ibid., ch. xlix. 13.\nWe know for a certainty that, after his holy and prophetic lordship had prohibited the victorious army from killing any of the inhabitants of Mekkah, he treated the latter kindly, whereon the Anss\u00e2r said to each other: \u2018This man, namely, the apostle of God, has gained the affection of the people as well as of his clansmen, and is fond of his birthplace.\u2019 Meanwhile the signs of Divine revelation began to manifest themselves on the august person of his lordship, and when the celestial inspiration had irradiated him, he addressed [reproaches to] the Anss\u00e2r: \u2018You have spoken so and so?\u2019 But they denied it; and he continued: \u2018[You said,] \u201cGod forbid that we should vacillate! We are the servants of God and of His apostle. We have exiled ourselves for His and for thy sake. We shall adhere to thee in life and death.\u201d\u2019 Hereon the Anss\u00e2r began to weep [for joy], and said: \u2018By Allah! we have spoken those words because we are attached to God and to His apostle.\u2019 His lordship then said: \u2018God the Most High and His apostle are believing you, and are asking your pardon.\u2019\n\nWe know from authentic traditions that, before the apostle of God entered Mekkah, he ordered eleven men and six women to be captured and slain, no matter where they would be found, and no matter if within or without the limits of the sanctuary. One of the men [to be killed] was A\u2019bd\u00fb-l-u\u2019zza B. Khanttal, and the reason for shedding his blood was that he had become a Musalm\u00e2n before the conquest of Mekkah, but had nevertheless wantonly killed a believer, had apostatized, and had fled to Mekkah. The details of this affair are as follows: When Ebn Khanttal had arrived in Madinah and had become a Musalm\u00e2n, his lordship called him by the name of A\u2019bdullah, and sent with him a man of the tribe Khozaa\u2019h to collect the Dzak\u00e2t [legal alms] in a certain tribe, and a man attended on him as a servant during the journey. One day Ebn Khanttal told this Khozaa\u2019y to prepare food for him, which he would eat as soon as he awoke. This fellow, however, was lazy, and when Ebn Khanttal awoke he found nothing to eat, but, on the contrary, the Khozaa\u2019y himself carelessly asleep.\nThis sight added to Ebn Khanttal's fire of hunger the fire of anger, and his passion so overpowered him that he slew his companion. After that he considered that if he were to return to Madinah the apostle of God would punish him; he therefore apostatized, and returned to Mekkah with the quadrupeds he had obtained as tributary alms. On the day the city was conquered he armed himself and fought against Kh\u00e2led B. Wolyd; afterwards, however, he fled from the battle, and took refuge in the house of the Ka'bah, as has been recorded above. Whilst his holy and prophetic lordship was engaged in circumambulating the Ka'bah, one of his companions, having caught sight of the man, exclaimed: 'Lo, here is Ebn Khanttal, who has taken hold of the curtains of the Ka'bah.' Then his lordship ordered him to be killed.\n\nAnother man of this kind was [A'bdullah] the milk-brother of O'thm\u00e2n B. O'ff\u00e2n B. Abu Ssar\u00e2j, who dwelt at Madinah, and was by the exalted command [of the prophet] engaged in writing down the Divine revelation, but he committed treachery in writing the glorious Qur\u00e2'n, by altering the words thereof. On a certain occasion he said: 'Muhammad B. A'bdullah knows not what he is speaking, and I say whatever I like, and write it down for him. Indeed, the Divine revelation comes down upon me in the same way as it comes down on him.' When his lordship the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014became aware of his felony, A'bdullah ran off to Mekkah, and on the day of the conquest thereof he requested Othm\u00e2n to intercede for him with the prophet, so as to save his life. Accordingly some days afterwards O'thm\u00e2n took him into the august assembly, and upon the strength of the obligation he was under to his mother [who had suckled them both] he asked his lordship to grant him quarter, but received no answer. O'thm\u00e2n having several times reiterated his petition without obtaining any reply, he approached that prince, took his blessed head into his arms, and said: 'O apostle of God, thou hast given A'bdullah to me!' After he had thus begged for a long time, the apostle of God said: 'Yes.' When\nO'thm\u00e2n had departed from the assembly with A'bdullah B. Sa'd, his lordship said to those present: 'What has hindered any one of you from rising and spilling the blood of that dog?' A'b\u00e2d B. Bashar then said: 'I swear by that God who has sent thee to the people that I was expecting a wink of the eye from thee! Had I not understood that thou hast slightly assented [to the request], I would have struck him down with my sword!' His lordship, however, replied: 'It is not becoming in a prophet to commit treachery by a wink of the eye.' It is related that after A'bdullah had obtained pardon he again made profession of the Faith, and some of his adventures will be narrated in the record of the Khalifate of O'thm\u00e2n, if it pleaseth Allah the Most High.\n\nA third man of this class was Howyrath B. Nafyr, who had with his unhallowed tongue greatly derided his lordship. When Mekkah was taken, and he had heard that people were searching for him, he left his house after A'li\u2014who stood at the door of it\u2014had gone away, and tried to conceal himself, but was overtaken on the road by the Commander of the Faithful, who executed the orders of the prince of men and demons with reference to him [and slew him].\n\nAnother individual of this kind was Maqys B. Sab\u00e2bah, and the reason for shedding his blood was as follows: His brother Hesh\u00e2m had come to Madinah and had professed the Faith, but in the Ghazwah of Martasa' one of the Anss\u00e2r mistook Hesh\u00e2m for an idolater and slew him. When Maqys had learnt this, he came from Mekkah to avenge the blood of his brother, and his lordship ordered the Anss\u00e2r to pay the blood-ransom to him, after receiving which, and after becoming a Musalm\u00e2n, Maqys [nevertheless] watched his opportunity, slew the murderer of his brother, apostatized, and fled to Mekkah, where he was on the day of the taking thereof engaged in a secret locality carousing with a number of idolaters. One of the companions, however, discovered that assembly, and made an end of his treachery with a good scimitar.\nAnother fellow of this kind was Hayar B. Alaswad, who had [formerly] much distressed his lordship, one of his misdeeds being that which he had committed with reference to Zaynab, the daughter of the apostle of God, as has been recorded above. On the day when Mekkah was taken the Musalm\u00e2ns could not find Hayar, and when that prince returned to Madinah Hayar entered the august assembly, uttered the formula of monotheism, acknowledged the prophecy of his lordship, made profession of the Faith, took hold of the skirts of apology, and his crimes were pardoned by his lordship.\n\nAnother man of this class was Ssafuw\u00e2n B. Ommyah, who had manifested great enmity towards the apostle of God. When he heard that sentence of death had been pronounced upon him he fled from Mekkah on the day it was taken, and endeavoured to reach the haven of safety by way of the sea. When O\u2019mayr B. Wohb Hajmy represented his case to the world-adorning mind of the lord of existences, he requested that Ssafuw\u00e2n might be pardoned, and after his petition was granted he pursued, overtook, and informed the latter of his success; but Ssafuw\u00e2n was astonished, and exclaimed: \u2018I swear by God that I shall not return until thou bringest me a sign from Muhammad.\u2019 Accordingly his lordship gave either his turban or his shawl to O\u2019mayr to show to Ssafuw\u00e2n. The former obeyed, and also induced the latter to make a profession of the Faith and to return to Mekkah, where he was admitted to the presence of the best of men, and spoke to him as follows: \u2018O Muhammad, O\u2019mayr tells me that thou hast given me quarter for two months. Is this true or not?\u2019 The prophet replied: \u2018O Ssafuw\u00e2n, I have given thee quarter for four months.\u2019 Ssafuw\u00e2n had, despite his idolatry, been present, and had attended on the heaven-aspiring stirrup in the Ghazwah of Tt\u00e2yf and of Honayn. When his holy and prophetic lordship was returning, and had arrived in the place called Jaghr\u00e2nah, he discovered a pass full of cattle, and Ssafuw\u00e2n was looking intently at the beauty of the sheep, as if wishing to devour them with\nhis eyes. His lordship, guessing the thoughts of Ssafuw\u00e2n, said to him: 'O Ssafuw\u00e2n, I present thee with all these.' After the latter had taken possession of the sheep and camels, he exclaimed: 'There is no soul as kindly disposed as the soul of a prophet.' Then he made his profession [of the Faith] on that very spot.\n\nAnother man of this class was Ka'b B. Zohayr, who had ridiculed his lordship the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and had fled on the day of victory, thus saving his life. At last, however, love for Isl\u00e2m prevailed in his heart, and he started with his brother Bahyr B. Zohayr to wait on his lordship, but before reaching the place of their destination he sent his brother in advance to propitiate his lordship. Bahyr, having been admitted to the felicity of foot-oscula\u00action, made a profession of the Faith, and knowing that Ka'b's doing so would likewise be acceptable, he interceded on that score for him. Ka'b arrived in Madinah in the ninth year after the Flight, became a Mus\u00e2lman, composed an elegy in praise of his lordship the best of men, and was received into his intimacy.\n\nAnother man of this kind was A'bdullah B. Alzaba'ry, who had always insulted the Musalm\u00e2ns and incited the idolaters to attack them; but when he heard what orders his holy and prophetic lordship had issued concerning him, he fled on the day Mekkah was conquered and went in the direction of Bakhr\u00e2n. At last, however, the love of Isl\u00e2m prevailed over his mind, so that he repented of what he had said and done, and returned from Bakhr\u00e2n with the intention of kissing the threshold of prophecy. When he arrived, the apostle of God recognised him from a distance, and said: 'Ebn Zaba'ry is coming, and the light of Isl\u00e2m is shining from his face.' When Ebn Zaba'ry came nearer, he exclaimed: 'I testify that there is no God but Allah, and I testify that thou art the apostle of Allah. Thanks and praises be to Allah, who has guided me to Isl\u00e2m! O apostle of God, I have offended thee many times, but now I repent of everything, and ask thy pardon. Order anything thou listest, for thou art the master of my life.' His lordship\nreplied: 'Praise be to Allah who has guided thee to Isl\u00e2m! Be aware that the profession of Isl\u00e2m blots out all other crimes.'\n\nAnother man of this kind was H\u00e2reth B. Al-t\u00e2la\u2019h, and the reason for shedding his blood was that he had much tried to injure and to insult the apostle. Therefore Ali the commander of the faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014having caught him, slew him on the day Mekkah was taken.\n\nAnother fellow of this sort was Wahshy, the murderer of Hamzah, whom the Musalm\u00e2ns were anxious to kill, and therefore he fled on the day of the conquest of Mekkah to T\u00e2yf. After some time, however, he was, with a number of other men of that region, admitted to the felicity of kissing the feet of his lordship the apostle, whereon he said: 'I testify that there is no God but Allah, and that Muhammad is the apostle of Allah.' His lordship the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014asked: 'Art thou the murderer of Hamzah?' He replied: 'Yes.' His lordship continued: 'Sit down and narrate the murder of my uncle Hamzah.' After Wahshy had narrated the event, his lordship said: 'Let me not see thee any more.' Accordingly, Wahshy henceforth avoided to meet the apostle of God, but during the Khalifate of Ssiddyq Akbar [i.e., Abu Bakr] he joined the army of Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd to attack Moseylamah the liar, who was vanquished at Hadyqatu-l-mout, and whom he killed with the same dagger with which he had slain Hamzah. It is related that Wahshy said: 'I killed the best of men during the time of ignorance, and the worst of them during the time of Isl\u00e2m.' Some chroniclers have narrated the affair of Wahshy in another manner in their books, but their details would only lengthen this account.\n\nAnother man of this kind was A\u2019kramah the son of Abu Jahl, and his blood was to be shed because during the lifetime of his father he had been his partner in persecuting his lordship. After the decease of his progenitor he marched in an army with Abu Sofy\u00e2n and other idolaters against his holy and prophetic lordship, and against the Musalm\u00e2ns.\nA'bdullah B. Zobayr has a tradition that in the year of the conquest of Mekkah, A'kramah B. Abu Jahl fled to Yemen for fear of being punished by the professors of Isl\u00e2m. He had an intelligent wife, O'mm Hakym by name, who was the daughter of H\u00e2reth B. Hesh\u00e2m, H\u00e2reth being the brother of Abu Jahl. On the occasion when the women of Mekkah paid homage to his holy and prophetic lordship, and made their profession of Isl\u00e2m, O'mm Hakym said to that prince: 'The son of my uncle [i.e., my husband] has fled to Yemen for fear of thee, and I appeal to thy kind disposition to grant him pardon.' His lordship replied: 'I grant him the pardon of Allah. Let no one injure him who encounters him.' Then O'mm Hakym went in search of A'kramah and found him near the shore, embarked in a vessel ready to sail, and on her making signs from the land A'kramah ordered a boat and approached her. O'mm Hakym exclaimed: 'Son of my uncle, I come from the best of men. Return! return! he has granted thee pardon.' It is related that A'kramah heard with the greatest pleasure the tidings of the forgiveness of the prophet of latter times\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and asked O'mm Hakym: 'Daughter of my uncle, thou hast besought him to forgive me; and has he granted me pardon despite all the injuries and insults which I have heaped on him?' O'mm Hakym rejoined: 'Yes; his kindness surpasses description and explanation. Return, and do not jeopardize thy life [by flight].' A'kramah assented, and, being overpowered with lust, whilst they were travelling desired to have connection with his wife, but she replied: 'I am a monotheist, and have been invested with the ornament of the Faith, but thou art an idolater, and void of the light of religious knowledge. I shall not allow thee to enjoy me until thou hast become a Musalm\u00e2n.' A'kramah said: 'It is a very great matter which hinders thee to join me.' When A'kramah had reached the vicinity of Mekkah, his lordship was apprised of his approach by Divine inspiration, and said to his friends: 'A'kramah, the son of Abu Jahl, is coming to you as a believer and a Moh\u00e2jer. You\nmust not insult [the memory of] his father, for to speak evil of a dead man may insult a living one, although it cannot injure the dead one.' Meanwhile O'mm Hakym put a veil on her face, and betook herself with her spouse to his lordship's tent, which she entered after obtaining admission, and said: 'O apostle of God, I have brought A'kramah.' His lordship jumped up for joy in such a manner that his blessed Red\u0101 fell from his back, and he gave permission to A'kramah to enjoy the happiness of kissing his fingers. When A'kramah entered, his lordship resumed his seat, and the former, standing opposite to him, spoke as follows: 'O Muhammad, this woman says that thou hast granted me pardon, and that I have nothing to apprehend from thy wrath?' He replied: 'She spoke truth, and thou art forgiven.' A'kramah then said: 'I testify that there is no God except Allah alone, who has no partner, and I testify that thou art His servant and His apostle.' He then drooped his head, perfectly abashed, and continued: 'O apostle of God, thou art the most veracious and the most honest man, but we have accused thee of falsehood on account of our great wretchedness and ignorance.' His lordship said: 'Ask whatever thou likest, and I shall comply with thy request as far as I am able.' Hereon A'kramah said: 'I ask thee to pray to the Lord of Glory to forgive me for every kind of enmity I have manifested towards thee, and for every step I made to elevate the banner of infidelity and to strengthen the professors of idolatry in order to show enmity to thee, and to blot out and to pardon every transgression committed by me either openly or secretly with reference to thee!' Accordingly his lordship lifted up his hands in prayer, asking God the Most High to pardon A'kramah all the sins he had himself enumerated. The latter continued: 'O apostle of God, I swear by God that for every dirhem I spent during the time of ignorance to obstruct the religion of God the Most High, I shall disburse two for the promotion thereof, and that for every one of the friends of Allah the Most High whom I have murdered during the time of my\ninfidelity I shall slay two of His foes.' It is said that after A'kramah had become ennobled by the robe of Faith he made great efforts to extinguish the blaze of infidelity and wickedness, until the time when he tasted the beverage of martyrdom in the Ghazwah of Ajnadyn, during the Khali-\nfate of F\u0101r\u016bq [i.e., O'mar].\n\nIt is related that on the day when Mekkah was taken, A'kramah had killed a Musalm\u0101n and had fled. When this was brought to the notice of his lordship the best of men, he smiled, but those who were present wondered, and said: 'O apostle of God, what wisdom is there in laughing in this case?' He replied: 'I have been informed that the slayer and the slain will grasp each other's hands, and will thus enter paradise.' This explanation intensified the amazement of the companions, because A'kramah had been a very prominent infidel, and they thought he was very far from professing Isl\u0101m. Sa'd B. Abu Woqq\u0101s relates that when A'kramah fled on the day on which Mekkah was taken he embarked in a vessel intending to sail to Yemen, but the waves of the sea became agitated, and the people who were in the ship said to each other: 'Sit down, for your God will not ward off anything from you.' A'kramah, however, poured forth his orisons to the courts of the Omnipotent Sovereign, saying: 'O Lord Most High, I promise that if I am saved from this calamity I shall go to Muhammad and become one of his adherents.' When the storm had abated A'kramah [disembarked and] made his appearance in the assembly of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and professed the Faith. Some have related that when the sea became stormy the captain of the ship said to A'kramah: 'Make a sincere profession!' The latter rejoined: 'What must I do, or what must I say?' The captain continued: 'Say: \"There is no God but Allah, because in this place no one can save us except the Lord of the inhabitants of the world.\"' A'kramah asked: 'Meanest thou the God to the acknowledgment of whose unity Muhammad is inviting us? But I have fled to avoid uttering these words.' It is related in some\nbiographical works that at the time when A'kramah was proceeding to Yemen by sea, he happened to read on the ship's side the words: 'Thy people are liars; for He is God;' and though he tried much to efface them, he was unable to do so. Some allege that he scraped off these words several times, but that they reappeared again. Then he said, 'This is a Divine command,' requested the vessel to be turned back, and this having been done, he left it, went to Mekkah, and having been admitted to the foot-osculation of the lord of existences, he made his profession of the Faith.\n\nOf the women, concerning whom the sentence of capital punishment had been decreed by the court of prophecy, one was Hinda, the mother of Moa'wiah, who had disembowelled Hamzah, and had masticated his liver on the day of Ohod. When, however, Mekkah had been conquered, she joined the women who went to pay homage to the apostle of God, and having tied a veil over her face, she entered the august assembly unknown to anyone, made her profession of Isl\u00e2m, removed the covering from her face, and said: 'I am Hinda, the daughter of O'tbah.' His lordship replied: 'Having arrived as a Mus\u00e2lman, thou art welcome.' Hinda thereon manifested love and sincerity, his holy and prophetic lordship opened his blessed mouth with congratulations towards her, and accepted her profession of Isl\u00e2m.\n\nAmong the number of the [condemned] six women, there were also two slave-girls of Ebn Khanttal who had been singing songs in derision of the apostle of God. One of them was killed and the other fled, but some time afterwards obtained pardon. The name of the slain girl was Qarynah, and of her who had become a Mus\u00e2lman, Qarana. Another person of this kind was also the freed slave of Ebn Khanttal, who was killed on that day. Another was S\u00e2rah, the manumitted slave of the Bani Al-muttalleb, who was, according to the assertion of the author of the Kamelu-t-tawarikh, slain on the day of the conquest of Mekkah. The sixth of them, Omm Sa'd, was likewise killed on that day.\nSome Events that took place during his Lordship's Sojourn at Mekkah.\n\nIt is related that on the second day after the conquest, a man named Jundab, of the tribe Badyl, arrived in Mekkah, and Farash B. Ommyah Ka'by pierced him with a sword, so that his bowels fell out. Jundab leant awhile against a wall, and [his soul] departed to the next world. When his lordship heard of this act, he preached a very eloquent sermon to this effect: 'From the day on which Allah the Most High created the heavens and the earth, He prohibited the blood of the inhabitants of Mekkah to be shed till the day of the resurrection. No pious servant who believes in God is permitted to shed blood in Mekkah, nor is any Mus\u00e2lman allowed to fell trees, to pull out grass, or to hunt in Mekkah.' He continued: 'If anyone says that it is licit to shed blood in Mekkah because the apostle of God has fought there and has shed blood, tell him that ere this it was not licit to anyone, nor shall it be so afterwards. Nor was it permitted to me except during one hour of the day, after which the inviolability of the sanctuary again returned to its former condition. O ye Khozaa'h people, abstain from murder! I order you to pay the blood-mulet for this slain man, and if hereafter you again kill somebody, his heirs shall have the option either to retaliate or to accept the blood-ransom.' Let it not remain hidden that the following words of the prince of the pious, 'It was not licit to me to spill blood, except during one hour of the day,' refer to the circumstance narrated in traditions, that on the day of the conquest of Mekkah some of the Qoraish vagabonds had assembled at the instigation of their chiefs and had kindled the fires of slaughter, and that by order of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014the victorious army had, for the purpose of exterminating them, drawn forth the arm of power from the sleeve of bravery, but had after the expiration of one hour terminated the carnage, likewise by the command of that prince; the tradition being to the purport that after the world-adorning mind\nhad been informed that the Qoraish perished, he ordered the troops to sheath their scimitars and to cease [fighting], the Khozaa'h tribe alone excepted, which had permission to kill every man of the Bani Bakr whom they could lay hold of.\n\nOne of the events which took place at the time of the conquest of Mekkah was that Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd had been ordered to sally forth with thirty troopers to destroy the idol temple of U\u2019zza, which he did by marching to Nakhlah, accomplishing his purpose, and again returning. When he made his report, his lordship asked: \u2018Hast thou seen anything in that place?\u2019 He said: \u2018No.\u2019 His lordship added: \u2018Thou hast not yet annihilated U\u2019zza.\u2019 Kh\u00e2led accordingly returned to the locality in anger, drew his sword, and made inquiries about U\u2019zza. He then discovered [the statue of] a nude black woman with dishevelled hair, whom he approached, uttering the words: \u2018Thou art not to be believed nor to be praised! Allah has humbled thee!\u2019 and cut her in twain with his sword. Thereon he returned and informed the prophet of what he had done, and his lordship said: \u2018That [statue of a woman] was U\u2019zza, who will no longer be worshipped in your country.\u2019\n\nFurther, Sa\u2019d B. Zayd Ashhal was sent to the idol-temple of Men\u00e2t to demolish it, this being an idol worshipped during the time of ignorance by the tribes Awus, Khazraj, and Ghus\u00e2n. When Sa\u2019d entered the temple of Men\u00e2t he beheld a black naked woman with dishevelled hair coming out of it, striking her breast and lamenting; but Sa\u2019d finished her with one blow of his sword, and having demolished the temple, he was made happy by being allowed to wait on the prince of existences.\n\nFurther, after Kh\u00e2led B. Wolyd had returned from Nakhlah, he was ordered to march to Yalmalam and to make inquiries about the tribe Hozaymah, who had during the time of ignorance slain the uncle of Kh\u00e2led, whose name was Gh\u00e2k B. Moghyrah, and also A\u2019wuf, the father of A\u2019bd\u00fb-r-rahman, which event had taken place as follows: The last-named two individuals had returned from a trading\nexcursion to Yemen, and had arrived in Yalmalam, in which place the greediness for their property impelled the Bani Hozaymah to murder them and to take possession of their goods. When Kh\u00e2led B. Wolyd arrived, with one hundred and fifty Moh\u00e2jer and Anss\u00e2r, as well as the Bani Salym, in the vicinity of the habitations of the Bani Hozaymah, the latter became suspicious, and having for a precaution donned their armour, they went out to meet Khaled, who asked them: 'Who are you?' They replied: 'We are Musalm\u00e2ns professing the Muhammadan religion.' Kh\u00e2led continued: 'Why are you armed, and why have you come out to meet me?' They replied: 'There is enmity between us and between an Arab tribe; we thought that perhaps you might be of that tribe.' This subterfuge was not accepted, and Kh\u00e2led said: 'Put away your arms.' They obeyed, whereon Kh\u00e2led ordered their hands to be tied to their backs, and each prisoner was taken charge of by one of his companions. During the night Kh\u00e2led issued orders to slay all the captives, and they were executed by the Bani Salym, the Moh\u00e2jer and the Anss\u00e2r refusing to co-operate. One, however, of the Bani Hozaymah [escaped and] reached the august assembly of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014to whom he represented what had taken place. There is a tradition to the effect that as soon as the Bani Hozaymah had thrown away their arms by order of Kh\u00e2led he immediately assailed them, and put nearly thirty of them to death. In short, when his lordship the apostle had been apprised that Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd had slain a number of men who were accustomed to worship in their mosques, he rose, turned his glorious countenance towards the Qiblah of prayer, and exclaimed thrice: 'O God, I am innocent of what Kh\u00e2led has done.' Then he sent a great deal of property by A'li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014to pay the blood-ransom and for the goods destroyed to the Bani Hozaymah, intending to make good the error of Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd, and thus to offer some consolation to that unfortunate tribe. A'li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014obeyed orders, and consoled the Bani Hozaymah.\nAfter he had returned from Yalmalam, and the prophet had become convinced that the Bani Hozaymah were satisfied, he pardoned the act of Kh\u00e2led at the intercession of one of his friends. It is said that A\u2019bdullah B. Abu Khud\u00e2r Aslamy was in that expedition, and that a youth of the prisoners of the Bani Hozaymah had been surrendered to him, and requested him to take him to one of the tents of the women for something he had to do there. A\u2019bdullah complied with the request of the youth, who entered a tent, spoke a few words, and recited some distichs to a woman, who answered him. Then A\u2019bdullah took the youth to the camp of Kh\u00e2led, and when he had been slain by order of the latter, the woman arrived, threw herself on the corpse, and moaned till she surrendered her soul to the Creator. When the people who had been present in the expedition informed the august mind of this event, his lordship remarked: \u2018There was not one compassionate man among you.\u2019\n\nThe Ghazwah of Honayn.\n\nW\u00e2qidy has related that when the apostle of God had conquered Mekkah, the nobles of the tribes Ho\u00e2z\u00e2n and Thaqyf said to each other: \u2018Muhammad has vanquished the Qoraish, and after he has completed their subjugation he will probably turn against us; therefore it will be suitable that we attack him ere he prepares his army and marches towards us.\u2019 After this consultation the tribe Ho\u00e2z\u00e2n entrusted M\u00e1lek B. A\u2019wuf Annassry\u2014who was in the vigour of youth, and celebrated for his liberality and munificence\u2014with the supreme command. The Bani Nassr, the Bani Khashym, the Bani Sa\u2019d B. Bakr, and a number of the Bani Hall\u00e2l obeyed him, but the clans Ka\u2019b and Kall\u00e2b, of the tribe Ho\u00e2z\u00e2n, refused to do so. The chiefs of the Thaqyf also prepared an army and joined M\u00e1lek B. A\u2019wuf. Some allege that on this occasion the commander of the Thaqyf was Q\u00e2reb B. Alaswad; others, however, assert that their chief was Kun\u00e2nah B. A\u2019bd Shum\u00e2yl Thaqfy. In fine, thirty thousand men had agreed\nto attack his holy and prophetic lordship, and took Woryd B. Ussamad\u2014who was blind, one-handed, and sixty years of age, but distinguished by his great intelligence among the young and the old\u2014along with them on their march. When they arrived in Awttas, Woryd heard the crying of the children, the voices of females, and the bellowings of cattle, and asked: \u2018What sounds are these which I hear?\u2019 The people replied: \u2018M\u00e2lek B. A\u2019wuf has brought the families and property of the combatants along with the army.\u2019 Hereon Woryd called M\u00e2lek, and asked him his reasons for bringing all these. M\u00e2lek replied: \u2018To induce the troops to be valiant in battle, for the sake of protecting their relatives, lest by becoming separated their name and reputation might be jeopardized. If their property is with them, they will fight bravely to prevent its falling into the hands of the enemy, and in this manner they will also be hindered from fleeing.\u2019 Woryd rejoined: \u2018This is a mistaken opinion and a vain hope, because if circumstances compel the people to flee nothing will retain them, and if thou gainest the victory it will be solely attributable to the valour of the swordsmen and lancers. If, however, the contrary takes place, only disgrace and shame will fall to thy lot.\u2019 He further asked where the Ka\u2019b and the Kall\u00e2b clans were, and was told that they had not joined the army. Then he said: \u2018Luck and activity have abandoned you; for if this had been a day of honour and exaltation to you the Ka\u2019b and the Kall\u00e2b would not have stayed away. Would to God you had followed their example, and had not embarked in this business!\u2019 After that he asked: \u2018What chiefs of the people are present?\u2019 And being told that A\u2019mru B. A\u2019am\u00e9r and A\u2019wuf B. A\u2019am\u00e9r were there, he said: \u2018What can be expected from these two sheep?\u2019 During this conversation Woryd also said to M\u00e2lek: \u2018It will be proper to remove the women, children, and property of the army to a strong fortress, and to march to the battle only with brave combatants.\u2019 M\u00e2lek, however, rejected this advice, and said: \u2018O Woryd, thou art old. Dotage has overtaken thee, and thou knowest not what thou\nsayest.' Woryd replied: 'O ye Ho\u00e2z\u00e2n tribe, M\u00e2lek will disgrace you. Your wives, children, and property will fall into the hands of the enemy, whereon the dust of shame and misfortune will cover you. He will abandon you, and will run into the fort of Tt\u00e2yf. Discard him and return.' These words made the people inclined to follow the old man's advice. M\u00e2lek, however, exclaimed: 'O ye Ho\u00e2z\u00e2n tribe, obey me, and mind not what anyone else says.' Then he drew his sabre, leant with his breast against it, saying: 'If you do not obey me, I shall fall on this sword so that it will come out at my back.' The Ho\u00e2z\u00e2n said: 'If we are rebellious he will commit suicide, from a feeling of wounded honour. Woryd, being old, blind, and weak, is unable to command us, and we know of no other man able to do it.' They therefore disregarded Woryd and adhered to M\u00e2lek, who marched with them to Honayn.\n\nWhen his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014was informed of the approach of the enemy, he despatched A'bdullah B. Abu Hadzar Aslamy to reconnoitre and to bring correct information. He also ordered the victorious army to make preparations for battle, and appointed A'bb\u00e2s B. Asyd to be his lieutenant in Mekkah. According to one tradition he marched with twelve thousand men\u2014ten thousand of which belonged to his own army, and two thousand of those who had been liberated at Mekkah\u2014and according to another with sixteen thousand, to Honayn. On that occasion he demanded one hundred cuirasses from Ssafuw\u00e2n B. Ommyah, and the latter queried: 'O Muhammad, wilt thou take them forcibly, or as a loan?' His lordship replied: 'As a loan.' Then Ssafuw\u00e2n loaded the cuirasses on his own camels, and sent them to that prince. A'bdullah B. Abu Hadzar obeyed orders, visited the camp of the enemy, and returned with the information that he had seen great numbers of men, with an immense quantity of arms and property; whereon his lordship answered, with a smile: 'I hope all that property will become the plunder of the Musalm\u00e2ns.'\n\nIt is said that M\u00e2lek B. A'wuf had sent three men to spy\nout the army of Isl\u00e2m; but they returned with fear and trembling, and when M\u00e1lek asked them for the reason of their trepidation, they said: 'When we arrived near the army of Muhammad we beheld men dressed in white riding piebald steeds, and we have never before seen men like them. It will now be proper for thee to return; for if thy army encounters those men, it will become as frightened as we are, and will flee.' M\u00e1lek, however, reproved the spies and kept them near himself, lest they might divulge what they had seen. Then he despatched another spy, who returned with the same news as the preceding ones. M\u00e1lek persisted in his enmity in spite of this strange information [about the celestial warriors on piebald horses], until he was defeated.\n\nIt is said that when Ssiddyq Akbar scanned the multitudes of the army of Isl\u00e2m, he said: 'This day we shall not be conquered on account of the paucity of our army.' Some biographers allege that these words had been uttered by another companion; but when his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014heard them he was displeased, and on account of those words God the Most High and Glorious put the army of Isl\u00e2m to flight in the beginning, to convince the people that victory can be gained only by the favour of the Omnipotent Sovereign, and not by great numbers; and with reference to this subject the verse 'Verily, Allah has given you the victory,' etc., was revealed.\n\nM\u00e1lek B. A\u2019wuf had entered the W\u00e2dy of Honayn before the arrival of the army of Isl\u00e2m, leaving his troops in ambush, and ordering them to rush upon the Musalm\u00e2ns as soon as they perceived them. The prophet reviewed his army just before the impending battle, giving a standard to O\u2019mar B. Alkhatt\u00e2b, another to A\u2019li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014another to Sa\u2019d B. Abu Woqq\u00e2ss, and so on to the chief of each Arab tribe, and marched against the enemy. The passage, however, being narrow, the army of Isl\u00e2m entered the W\u00e2dy of Honayn in separate detachments by numerous routes. The opponents were watching their opportunity, attacked the Musalm\u00e2ns suddenly, and so confused them\nthat they fled. The first brigade which commenced to run was that of the Bani Salym, with the multitudes under Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd, most of whom had no arms [having thrown them away in their flight?]. The defeat was so general that but a small number remained around the person of his lordship the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014with the following heroes: A\u2019li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014A\u2019bdullah B. Masu\u2019d, Abu Sofy\u00e2n B. Alh\u00e2reth B. A\u2019bd-ul-Muttalleb with the children of Ja\u2019fer, and Rahya\u2019h with the sons of A\u2019bb\u00e2s, Quthan and Fadzl, and As\u00e2mah B. Zayd with his brother and the brother of his mother, Omm Ayman. When his holy and prophetic lordship perceived that his companions acted according to the proverb, \u2018The tenets of apostles cannot put a stop to flight,\u2019 he desired to comfort them with the words: \u2018Do thou [O prophet] bear [the insults of thy people] with patience, as [our] apostles who were endued with constancy bore [the injuries of their people],\u2019 and to induce them to remain steadfast in the battle. He therefore several times repeated, with his pearl-dropping mouth, the words: \u2018O ye helpers of Allah, and helpers of His prophet, I am the servant and the apostle of Allah.\u2019 According to another tradition he said: \u2018Where to, O men?\u2019 The confusion of the Musalm\u00e2ns was, however, so great that not one of them looked back. On that occasion the apostle of God impelled the camel on which he was mounted to move towards the enemy; but Abu Sofy\u00e2n B. Alh\u00e2reth took hold of its bridle, and A\u2019bb\u00e2s B. A\u2019bd-ul-Muttalleb, catching hold of the heaven-aspiring stirrup, would not allow him to proceed. Hereon his lordship shouted: \u2018I am the prophet! I do not lie! I am the son of A\u2019bd-ul-Muttalleb.\u2019\n\nJ\u00e2ber\u2014Allah reward him!\u2014says: \u2018We marched as far as the W\u00e2dy of Honayn, where the enemy was concealed in ambush in a gorge. All of a sudden we perceived a multitude, armed with swords and lances, rushing at us and putting us all to flight, so that no man cared for another man. The apostle turned to the right side of the W\u00e2dy,\n\n370 Qur\u00e2\u00ee, ch. xlvi, 34.\nto which place also nine of the Bani A\u2019bd-ul-Muttalleb hastened, and guarded him, taking up their positions around his camel. On that occasion M\u00e2lek B. A\u2019wuf exclaimed: \u2018Point out Muhammad to me!\u2019 And when he learned where the prophet was, he hastened towards him, but Ayman, the son of Omm Ayman, obstructed his way, and fought with him till he attained martyrdom. After that M\u00e2lek tried much to approach the apostle of God, but his horse refused to move.\n\nIt is related that when the Musalm\u00e2ns had fled and were dispersed, the Qoraish idolaters and a number of Mekkans, who had been compelled nolens volens to embrace Islam on the day the city was taken, rejoiced and vented their feelings of envy, uttering expressions resembling those of Abu Sofy\u00e2n B. Harb, who said: \u2018The companions of Muhammad are flying so furiously that they will halt nowhere until they reach the seashore.\u2019 Another man exclaimed: \u2018Good news to thee, O Ssafuw\u00e1n: Muhammad and his friends have fled from the battle-field!\u2019 And Kaldah B. Hanbal, the maternal brother of Ssafuw\u00e1n B. Ommyah, said: \u2018This is a day on which sorcery becomes useless.\u2019 But Ssafuw\u00e1n replied to everyone, saying: \u2018Be silent! May Allah break thy jaws! If a man of the Qoraish is my ruler, I am more pleased than when one of the Ho\u00e2z\u00e1n becomes governor.\u2019\n\nThere is a tradition of Muhammad B. Esah\u00e2q that Shaybah B. O\u2019thm\u00e2n B. Abu Ttolhah stated as follows: \u2018When the prophet marched to Honayn I was also present, intending to wreak vengeance upon him if opportunity served for the deaths of my father and brother, who had been killed at Ohod. When the two armies met, and the Musalm\u00e2ns had been put to flight, but the apostle of God had remained, I alighted from my camel, bared my sword, and intended to attack him from the right side; I, however, caught sight of A\u2019bb\u00e1s B. A\u2019bd-ul-Muttalleb standing in a white cuirass which shone like silver, and cleaning the dust from the person of that prince. I then said to myself: \u201cThis is the uncle of Muhammad, and I can do\nnothing to him on this side. Then I meant to rush at him from the left, but there I perceived his uncle's son, Abu Sofy\u00e2n B. Alh\u00e2reth, protecting him, and saw that I could not touch him with a lance in that direction. Accordingly, I determined to get at him with my sword from the rear, but I perceived a flame of fire, like lightning, which intervened between him and me, so that I was nearly burned. This so frightened me that I covered my eyes with my hands, and that very instant his lordship happened to cast a glance at me, saying: \"O Shaybah, come nearer!\" When I approached he placed his hand on my breast, and exclaimed: \"O God, drive away Satan from him!\" I swear by God that then his lordship became dearer to me than my own ears and eyes. Then I began to fight the infidels by order of his lordship, and if at that time my father had been alive, and had been an enemy of the apostle of God, and had encountered me, I would have slain him.\n\nIt is said that in the morning of the day of Honayn, when the Musalm\u00e2ns had been dispersed, his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014said to A'bb\u00e2s, who had a strong voice: 'Call our friends in this manner: \"O ye Anss\u00e2r, O ye companions of brownness, O ye companions of the chapter of the cow.\"371 Abb\u00e2s obeyed, and the companions who heard his exclamation hastened from all directions to wait upon the prince of existences, whom they found to be safe. The first crowd who enjoyed the felicity of kissing the heaven-aspiring stirrup consisted of a number of Anss\u00e2r, whom his lordship asked: 'Are there any others with you?' They replied: 'No; but if thou wilt go to Rak A'm\u00e2d, we shall not fail to serve thee, and to place our very lives at thy disposal.' After that the army became victorious, as God the Most High has said in the glorious Qur\u00e2\u00ee: 'Allah afterwards sent down His security upon His apostle and upon the faithful, and sent down troops [of angels] which ye saw not,' etc., to the end of the verse.372\n\n371 This is the title of ch. ii. of the Qur\u00e2\u00ee. 372 Qur\u00e2\u00ee, ch. ix. 26.\nIt is related that when the companions had, in consequence of the call of O\u2019thm\u00e2n [supra A\u2019bb\u00e2s], assembled around the apostle of God to the number of nearly one hundred, they again attacked the enemy with perfect confidence, and his lordship exclaimed: \u2018Now the furnace of war is heated, and the fires of the battle are kindled.\u2019 During the contest the apostle of God alighted from his camel, took up a handful of earth, saying, \u2018The countenances are touched,\u2019 and, in fact, there was not a single eye into which some of that earth had not entered, and some traditions have it that their mouths were filled with earth. After that he mounted a camel, and implored the Lord of Glory to vouchsafe him the victory. Then the breeze of conquest wafted over the army of Isl\u00e2m, and the infidels fled in confusion. There is a tradition that his lordship ordered his camel to stoop, and that he took up a handful of earth in this position. There is also a statement that he had taken up the earth by order of Jebr\u00e2\u00eel, and some allege that A\u2019li took up a handful of soil according to the command, which he handed to the prince of the inhabitants of the world. J\u00e2ber the Anss\u00e2r\u00ee states: \u2018The noise of the gravel, which the apostle of God projected in the battle of Honayn, at the faces of the idolaters, so struck my ears that I imagined sand was being poured out from the sky into a dish;\u2019 and this event is referred to in the blessed verse: \u2018Neither didst thou, O Muhammad, cast [the gravel into their eyes] when thou didst [seem to] cast it; but Allah cast [it], that He might prove the true believers by a gracious trial from Himself.\u2019 There is also a tradition that in the said battle every stone and every tree assumed in the eyes of the opponents the shape of a trooper pursuing them. There is a tradition of Jobayr B. Motta\u2019m that he said: \u2018When the Musalm\u00e2ns drew their swords and attacked the infidels, I perceived something black descending from the sky, which fell down between us and the enemy. Looking closely at the object, I discovered it to be a mass of black ants, which became\n\n373 Qur\u00e2\u00ee, ch. viii. 17.\nso numerous that they filled the length and breadth of that W\u00e2dy. In connection with this circumstance the glorious companions overpowered the professors of heresy and of hypocrisy, but I entertain no doubt that those ants were angels.' Sa'yd, the son of Jobayr, states: 'God the Most High and Glorious sent five thousand [angels?] to aid us.'\n\nIt is related of M\u00e2lek B. Awus that he said: 'Some of my people who were present in the battle have related that when his holy and prophetic lordship threw a handful of gravel against us there was not a single man on our side whose eyes it had not touched. Our hearts began to trepitate, and great confusion overwhelmed us. Between the sky and the earth I perceived men dressed in white garments and mounted on piebald horses. They had sashes on both shoulders, and we became so frightened that we were unable to look at them.' It is on record that after the termination of the battle one of the opponents asked: 'Where have those men dressed in white and mounted on piebald horses gone to, by whose efforts alone we have been defeated?' When these words were reported to the august mind of his lordship he said: 'They were angels.'\n\nIt is related that in the W\u00e2dy of Honayn an idolater, Abu Jardal by name, was riding towards the Musalm\u00e2ns on a camel. He was a fearless warrior and great shedder of blood, so corpulent and tall that none of the Arabs dared to encounter him in single combat, or to attack him. In his perfect self-confidence and pride Abu Jardal was on that day reciting Rajaz verses and challenging an opponent; the victorious companions, however, hesitated to fight him, but all of a sudden the lion of attack, and son of the Mussttafa's uncle [i.e., A'li] rushed on Abu Jardal, and slew that obdurate wretch with his bright scimitar in such a manner that the sanguinary planet Mars was astonished, the professors of Isl\u00e2m were comforted, and the idolaters discomfited.\n\nFour men of the victorious army attained the honour of martyrdom, seventy of the opponents departed to hell, and the Ho\u00e2z\u00e2n, with the Thaqyf, fled from the battle-field in\nthe most abject manner. On that day six thousand cloaks, twenty-four thousand camels, forty thousand Qqyas of silver, and more than forty thousand sheep, fell into the hands of the professors of monotheism and piety. In consequence of this victory, many hypocrites and heretics became adorned with the decoration of the Faith, entered the circle of adherence to his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and placed their heads on the line of obedience.\n\nAfter the companions had again become victorious in the battle, by an increase of Divine favour, the opponents dispersed in three directions. One detachment proceeded with M\u00e2lek B. A\u2019wuf to the fort of Tt\u00e2yf, another fled into the Battyn [low country] of Nakhlah, and the third hastened to Awtt\u00e2s in order to guard the property there. His lordship the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014whose luminous mind was the depository of the evident signs [i.e., verses of the Qur\u00e2n] despatched Abu A\u2019amer Asha\u2019ry with a detachment, in which was also Zobayr B. Ala\u2019ww\u00e2m and Abu M\u00fbsa Asha\u2019ry, the cousin of Abu A\u2019amer, in pursuit of the fugitives towards Awtt\u00e2s. The Musalm\u00e2n forces overtook the opponents after traversing the necessary distance, and used their swords and lances to gain the approbation of God the Most High. While, however, the fire of contention and battle was raging, Abu A\u2019amer, the commander of the glorious army, attained the honour of martyrdom, while Abu M\u00fbsa, making the best use of the weapons for piercing and striking, put the infidels to flight, and Woryd B. Ussamad, the general of the idolaters, or, according to another tradition, Ebn Al-da\u2019h, departed to hell.\n\nThis victory became the cause of many others, and the victorious troops hastened in due order to the foot-osculat ion of the prince of former and of latter times. After M\u00e2lek B. A\u2019wuf had been put to flight, his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014ordered the spoils to be collected in the place called Joghr\u00e2n, in order to distribute them as an opportunity occurred, the surveillance over the plunder and the captives being meanwhile entrusted to A\u2019b\u00e2d B.\nBashar the Anss\u00e1ry. One of the prisoners was Asm\u00e2, the daughter of H\u00e2reth B. A\u2019bd\u00fb-l-\u2019uzza, whom the companions treated harshly in her captivity, although she repeatedly assured them that she had been the milk-sister of the prophet. They would not believe her, but at last placed her on a camel and conveyed her to the exalted presence of his lordship, to whom she said: \u201cI am thy foster-sister, O apostle of God.\u201d He replied: \u2018There must be a sign to prove it.\u2019 Accordingly she mentioned some circumstances in her remembrance, and as soon as the prophet recognised her he leapt up from his seat, and, spreading out his sacred Red\u00e2, honoured Asm\u00e2 with a seat thereon. Tears trickled from his sacred cheeks, and he inquired about Halymah, as well as about her husband. Asm\u00e2 replied: \u2018It is a long time since they have departed from this to the next world.\u2019 His holy and prophetic lordship continued: \u2018If thou art inclined to remain with us thou wilt be honoured and respected, but if not I shall give thee something wherewith to return to thy country.\u2019 But according to the proverb, \u2018The love of one\u2019s country is a part of religion,\u2019 Asm\u00e2 preferred to depart, and was presented by his lordship with one girl, three slaves, camels, and sheep. Kasyl reports that there exists a tradition to the effect that when Asm\u00e2 became adorned with the decoration of the Faith, and returned to her country, her people said: \u2018Why hast thou not asked the apostle of God to pardon the trespass of Baj\u00e2d?\u2019 This man was a connection of Halymah, and his crime consisted in having one day cut a Musalm\u00e2n to pieces and burnt him. His lordship had therefore issued orders\u2014on the occasion when he sent his victorious troops in pursuit of the fugitives of Honayn\u2014to capture Baj\u00e2d. This having been done, the man was kept prisoner till Asm\u00e2 arrived and interceded for him at the request of her people, whereon he was pardoned. His lordship questioned Asm\u00e2 also about her other relatives, and she replied: \u2018My brother, sister, and uncle are still living.\u2019 His lordship said: \u2018Return and live with thy people in Joghr\u00e2n, for I shall go to Tt\u00e2yf, shall meet you again next year in Jogh-\nr\u00e1n, and make arrangements for your subsistence.' Accordingly, when his lordship paid a visit to Asm\u00e2 and to her people in the just-named place, he presented her and her relatives with a great deal of property and cattle.\n\nThe Ghazwah of Tt\u00e2yf.\n\nIt has been narrated above that a number of idolaters had left the battle-field in dismay with M\u00e2lek B. A\u2019wuf and had gone to Tt\u00e2yf. Some of those people were of the tribe Ho\u00e2z\u00e2n and some of the Thaqyf, who had, before the battle and subsequent flight, strengthened and provisioned that citadel for a whole year; accordingly they garrisoned and closed it, being again prepared for war. When this information came to the knowledge of his lordship, who was the promulger of the signs of mercy [i.e., verses of the Qur\u00e2n], he concluded to march in that direction and to conquer the fort. He then entrusted A\u2019li B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb\u2014u. w. b.\u2014with the glorious standard, and sent Abu O\u2019bay-dah Jurr\u00e2h, or according to another tradition Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd, with one thousand valiant combatants for a vanguard, and marched after them himself to Tt\u00e2yf with the rest of the army. During the journey the castle of M\u00e2lek B. A\u2019wuf, near which the army passed, was burnt by order of the prophet, who arrived at his destination after performing the march, and encamped near the fort, the garrison of which, however, poured forth a shower of arrows, wounding numerous Musalm\u00e2ns; therefore, the august camp was shifted to a position where the mosque of Tt\u00e2yf stands at present. On that occasion Ttofayl B. A\u2019mru, who had gone to demolish the idol-temple of Dhu-l-Kayf, returned, and joined the victorious army with four hundred men of his own people and tribe, who carried with them appliances needed for a siege. His holy and prophetic lordship also ordered his glorious companions to fell the date-trees and to destroy the vineyards of the neighbourhood. Perceiving these operations, the people of the fort began to lament and to implore his lordship to show mercy for the sake of God and the poor cultivators, and to order\nthe soldiers to cease felling the trees; but his lordship replied: 'I abandon them to the mercy of God.' During this siege, which lasted eighteen or, according to others, forty days, great battles took place, so that many of the glorious companions were wounded; twelve of them tasted the beverage of martyrdom, and one of the martyrs of Tt\u00e2yf was A'bdullah B. Abu Bakr Ssiddyq. While the siege lasted his lordship one day issued orders for a proclamation to be made to the effect that, 'Everyone coming from the fort to us shall be free,' in consequence of which nearly twenty slaves came down, attained the felicity of carpet-osculation, and were all manumitted by his lordship, who delivered their necks from the yoke of slavery, allotting each of them to a Musalm\u00e2n, who had to provide for him. Afterwards, when the people of Tt\u00e2yf waited upon the prince of this world, professed the Faith, and surrendered the keys of the fort, they said: 'O apostle of God, restore to us our slaves.' His lordship replied: 'They are free-men of the God of mankind, and will never again be your serfs.' It is related that during the siege of Tt\u00e2yf his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014called A'li B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb and communicated many secrets to him, whereat the people were astonished, and said to each other: 'The prophet of God has told many wonderful and long secrets to the son of his uncle.' But when his lordship heard this, he said: 'I did not tell him mysteries, but God the Most High did'\u2014meaning, 'I spoke to A'li by the command of God.'\n\nDistich: Parrot-like I was kept before a mirror;\nWhat the eternal master told me to say, I said.\n\nIt is related that during the siege of Tt\u00e2yf his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014once had a dream, in which he saw a large pitcher full of milk, or, according to another tradition, of fresh butter, and before he stretched forth his hand to taste it a cock made its appearance, which touched the pitcher with its beak and emptied all its contents. When his lordship narrated this dream to Ssiddyq [i.e., Abu Bakr], who was an excellent interpreter, he replied:\n'O apostle of God, this vision means that thou art not allowed to take the fort this year.' His lordship believed Ssiddyq, and replied: 'Thou hast spoken the truth, for I have myself thus explained my dream.'\n\nIt is related that Khowlah, the spouse of O'thm\u00e2n B. Motta'wun, requested the apostle of God to give her the trinkets and ornaments of the daughter of A'yl\u00e2n and of the daughter of Sohayl when he conquered the fort, because these two women were, by their great property and numerous camels, distinguished above all the other women of Tt\u00e2yf. His lordship, however, replied: 'How can I give thee the ornaments of even one of these two women, since we are not allowed to take the fort?' She reported these words to the great F\u00e2r\u00fbq [i.e., O'mar], and he also asked: 'O apostle of God, is it certain that the fort will not be taken?' He replied: 'Yes.' O'mar accordingly issued marching orders with the consent of his lordship, and the professors of Isl\u00e2m being displeased with them, asked: 'How can we return without having taken the fort?' His lordship rejoined: 'Then fight!' The companions therefore attacked the fort, but again returned after receiving many wounds. His lordship then said: 'To-morrow we shall march away, if it pleaseth Allah the Most High.' This time, however, the victorious army was greatly pleased, and marched away from the fort the next day.\n\nIt is related in some biographies that, while the siege of Tt\u00e2yf was being carried on, his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014appointed A'li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014with a number of glorious companions to make excursions into the country, and to destroy every idol they could find. The lord A'li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014obeyed orders and started, but encountered on the road a number of valiant men of the tribe Khusha'm, among whom there was a man so confident of his strength that he came out from among the people desiring to fight a duel, and as none of the professors of Isl\u00e2m ventured to fight that idolater in single combat, A'li B. Abu Ttaleb\u2014u. w. b.\u2014at last responded to the challenge, despite of the protests of Abu-l-a'ass B. Rabyi', who was\nthe son-in-law of the apostle of God, and who said: 'It is not proper that the commander of the force should begin the combat, seeing that there are so many others. The Commander of the Faithful, however, replied: 'No other man is willing to go, and if I am slain, thou must take the command.' Thereon A'li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014met the traitor, and sent him with one stroke of his bright scimitar to the abode of perdition; afterwards he destroyed all the idols of the Bani Ho\u00e2z\u00e2n and of the Bani Thaqyf which were in that region. The apostle was waiting for his return near the gate of the fort of Tt\u00e2yf, and as soon as the prince of saints had terminated his business, he joined the august camp, was received by the seal [i.e., the last] of prophets\u2014u. w. b.\u2014with the exclamation of the Takbyr, and was led into privacy, where the communication of mysteries, alluded to above, took place. Ja'ber relates that while the prophet and A'li were closeted together, O'mar entered, and said: 'O apostle of God, tellest thou secrets to A'li?' And when his lordship gave the reply already mentioned [above], F\u00e2ri\u00fbq repented of his question, returned, and said to himself: 'I fear this opposition will end like that of Hodaybiah.' A man who had been present in the Ghazwah of Tt\u00e2yf said: 'When we were marching away, I rode by the side of the apostle of God, and happened to wear heavy sandals on my feet. The two camels accidentally approached each other so closely that my sandal touched his blessed leg, whereon his lordship struck my foot with his whip, saying: \"Go a little further, because my leg is aching.\" The next day, however, he sent a man to call me, and I said to myself: \"Yesterday my sandal gave him pain, and possibly he will punish me to-day.\" But when I obtained the honour of foot-osculation, he said: \"Yesterday I struck thy foot with my whip, and to-day I have summoned thee to accept the reparation.\" And he gave me fifty Bunhahs.'374 Another companion says: 'When the apostle of God arrived in the locality of Qurn, he rode\n\n374 Probably fifty slices of dried meat are thus designated.\nthe she-camel Qasswy, and I was riding by his side. His lordship, desiring to strike the animal with his whip, accidentally struck me, then looked at me, and asked: \"Has my whip touched thee?\" I said: \"Yes, O apostle of God; may my father and mother be a sacrifice for thee;\" and when we halted at Joghr\u00e2nah [supra Joghr\u00e2n] he gave me one hundred and twenty sheep as a reparation, and, beginning with this capital of the sheep, I became [gradually] a man of property and opulence.'\n\nLARGESSES OF THE APOSTLE OF MEN AND DEMONS, AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPOILS OF HONAYN.\n\nWhen the apostle of God encamped in Joghr\u00e2nah, he scattered gifts with his blessed hands, and bestowed rich presents on a number of new Musalm\u00e2ns who had been surnamed M\u00fbj\u00eefat Qul\u00fbb. It is related that when the ready cash of the spoils was brought to his lordship, Abu Sofy\u00e2n, who was very covetous, made good use of the opportunity, presented himself in the august assembly, and said: 'O apostle of God, this day thou art the richest man among the Qoraish!' His lordship smiled, whereon Abu Sofy\u00e2n, intent on his own profit, continued: 'Give me some of this property.' Then his lordship ordered forty Oqyas of silver to be given to him, to which also one hundred camels were added. Abu Sofy\u00e2n hereon said: 'Rejoice my son Yazid with a gift.' Hereon, at a signal of his lordship, the same amount was bestowed on Yazid. Abu Sofy\u00e2n was, however, not yet satisfied, and asked: 'Where is the share of my son Moa'wiah?' His lordship then ordered forty Oqyas of silver and one hundred camels to be given to Moa'wiah likewise. Then Abu Sofyan exclaimed: 'May my mother and father be a sacrifice for thee! I swear by Allah that thou art liberal in war and in peace, and that thou hast been most bountiful and kind; may God reward thee!' In the same way he bestowed one hundred camels on Hakym B. Huz\u00e2m, and added at his request one hundred more. Every one of the Arab chiefs, such as Sohayl B. A'mru, and Ssafuw\u00e2n B. Ommyah, and Hoyttab B. A'bdu-l-u'zza,\nand Asyd B. H\u00e1rethah Thaqfy, and H\u00e1reth B. Hesh\u00e1m the brother of Abu Jahl, and Qays B. A\u2019dy, and Afza\u2019 B. H\u00e1bes Yatmy, and O\u2019tbah B. Hossyn Far\u00e1zy, were rejoiced with a present of one hundred camels each. Others, like Hesh\u00e1m B. A\u2019mru A\u2019amery, and Makhranah B. Naofel, and Sa\u2019yd B. Marbuu\u2019, who were not comprised in the above number, received fifty camels each. There are, however, two opinions on this subject among the U\u2019lam\u00e1, some alleging that these gifts were bestowed from the fifth part, and others that they were given from the whole booty.\n\nIt is related that on the above occasion A\u2019bb\u00e1s B. Mur-d\u00e1s Aslamy received [not more than] four camels, and was grieved on that account. In his anger he recited some distichs, which his lordship overheard, turned to A\u2019li Bin Abu Tt\u00e1leb and said: \u2018Get up and rescind his tongue from me!\u2019 A\u2019li obeyed, took A\u2019bb\u00e1s by the hand, went away with him, and A\u2019bb\u00e1s asked: \u2018Wilt thou cut off my tongue?\u2019 His lordship, however, replied: \u2018I shall do what the apostle of God has commanded me.\u2019 Thus they proceeded till they arrived where the flocks of camels were. A\u2019li then said to A\u2019bb\u00e1s: \u2018Choose one hundred from these camels.\u2019 A\u2019bb\u00e1s replied: \u2018May my father and mother be a sacrifice for thee! How liberal, beneficent and knowing you are!\u2019 A\u2019bb\u00e1s says: \u2018On that occasion A\u2019li spoke to me as follows: \u201cThe apostle of God had given thee four camels, because he considered thee to be one of the number of Anss\u00e1r, Moh\u00e1jer, and intimate friends. If, therefore, thou art inclined to be considered one of those who partook in the Flight and afforded aid, thou must be content with four, but if thou desirest to be numbered with the M\u00falyat Qul\u00fcb, take one hundred camels.\u201d I rejoined: \u201cWhat sayest thou in this matter?\u201d And A\u2019li continued: \u201cIt will be better for thee to be satisfied with the gift of God and of the apostle, and not to be deceived by the goods of this world, which are only unrighteous gain:\u201d\n\nDistich: Aspire to high ends, because God and the people Will esteem thee according to thy aspirations.\nA'bb\u0101s continues: 'I said to A'li: \"I shall agree to whatever thou likest, and as thou art second only to the apostle, I shall obey thy orders.\"\n\nIn a tradition it is stated that when the prince of existences\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had gladdened the hearts of the Qoraish princes and of all the Arab chiefs with abundant gifts, to attach them more to Isl\u0101m, and to [make them content at] their being [now] Musalm\u0101ns, he gave nothing at all either to the nobles, or to any of the Anss\u0101r, on account of the trust and confidence he had reposed in them. Some of them, nevertheless, vented their feelings of anger and grief by expressing to each other sentiments like the following: 'He bestows these gifts on the Qoraish and on all the tribes, but we receive nothing.' According to another tradition, they said: 'This man, having arrived among his relatives and cousins, wishes to do them good; but wherever there is work and trouble, he sends us to undergo it, although our swords have been dripping with the blood of these idolaters.' When his lordship heard of this state of things, he ordered the Anss\u0101r to congregate in a tent, excluding all other persons. He then addressed them as follows, after offering praises and thanksgivings to the Almighty: 'O ye Anss\u0101r, what words are these I have heard about you? Have you uttered them or not?' The principal men of that assemblage then replied: 'O prophet of God, our old men and chiefs have said nothing, and only youths have spoken in that manner.' His lordship continued: 'Have I not come to you when you were in a fiery pit from which God the Most High has delivered you?' The Anss\u0101r said: 'Yes; thanks be to Allah and to His prophet.' According to another tradition, however, he said: 'Have I not found you in aberration, and has not the Most High guided you through me?' The Anss\u0101r having acknowledged the verity of the assertions of the promulgator of truth, he continued: 'Have you not been foes to each other, and has not God made you friends through my instrumentality? Have you not been few, and God has made you many? Have you not been destitute,\nand has not the Most High made you rich?' The Anss\u00e2r approved of all these sentiments, and the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014asked: 'O ye Anss\u00e2r, why do you not answer me?' They queried: 'What reply can we give thee; may our fathers and mothers be a sacrifice to thee! Thou hast conferred obligations and favours upon us, and He who knows all secrets is a witness to these words.' The apostle of God continued: 'Say whatever you like, and be veracious.' They replied: 'Thou hast come to us when the people were accusing thee of falsehood but we knew thee to be truthful. No one cared for thee, but we have helped and assisted thee. Thou hast been expelled from thy country, but we have received thee in ours. Thou wast poor and destitute, but we were liberal towards thee. Thou hast come in fear, but we have given thee security.' His lordship rejoined: 'What you say is all true.' At these words the Anss\u00e2r began to weep; the old men among them arose, and, being ennobled by kissing the hands and knees of the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014they said: 'O apostle of Allah, we are pleased with God and with His prophet. Let Him distribute our private property if He likes, because our minds are not bent on the goods of this world. Our grief and fear was to be separated from thee, and not on account of the smallness of our possessions.' His holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014replied: 'The Qoraish are yet near to ignorance; I desired to remedy their misfortune and to rivet their hearts to the Faith.' According to another tradition, he said: 'O ye Anss\u00e2r, be not angry, for I give property to the M\u00fblf\u00e2t Qul\u00fbb, but you I leave with your Faith, and trust to your perfect sincerity. Do you agree that others return to their homes with camels and sheep, but you with the apostle of God. I swear by Allah that what you return with is better than what the [other] people return with.' After that he said: 'To Ja'yl B. Sor\u00e2qah, who is one of my poor but sincere and illustrious companions, I have given nothing; but to every one of the O'tbahs and Afza'hs I have given one hundred camels, although Ja'yl is more dear to me than a world full of\nO\u2019tbahs and Afza\u2019hs. I am certain of his profession of Islam, and [by bestowing gifts on the others] my intention was to gain the people over, and to induce them to make a profession of the Faith. I mean, nevertheless, to write a document to the effect that after my decease Bahrayn\u2014a better place than which does not exist among the localities God the Most High has vouchsafed to allow us to conquer\u2014should be your own peculiar domain.\u2019 Now the Anss\u00e2r again commenced to lament and to weep, saying: \u2018O apostle of God, after thy decease we have no need of this world, nor of the goods thereof. May the day never arrive when the shadow of thy favour will be removed from above our heads!\u2019 His lordship rejoined: \u2018There is no remedy against that day. After my time, when difficulties beset you, you are to remain steadfast and patient, that you may meet Allah and His prophet without shame and confusion. Your portion will be the lake Kawthar,\\(^{375}\\) the length and the breadth whereof is as large as the distance between Ssana\u2019a and O\u2019m\u00e2n, and the number of its vessels exceeds that of the stars.\u2019 According to another tradition, he said: \u2018After me you will encounter [various] events, but you must remain steadfast till you meet me near the lake.\u2019 He also said: \u2018The Anss\u00e2r are my intimate friends, and the confidants of my secret. If the people walk one way, and the Anss\u00e2r another, I shall follow the latter. O God, pardon the Anss\u00e2r, and the children of the Anss\u00e2r, and pardon the Anss\u00e2r!\u2019 Then the Anss\u00e2r began to weep so vehemently for joy and gladness that their moustaches were moistened [by their tears]. They poured forth their thanksgivings to God the Most High that they had not been decoyed by [the love of] riches, and that they had not apostatized from God and from the apostle.\n\nIt is related that a number of the Ho\u00e2z\u00e2n, who had arrived at Joghr\u00e1nah to kiss the feet of his holy and prophetic lordship, became Musalm\u00e2ns, and informed his lordship that the rest of their tribe had made profession of\n\n\\(^{375}\\) Qur\u00e2\u00ee ch. cviii. bears the above title. See Sale\u2019s notes thereon.\nIsl\u00e2m, and said: 'O apostle, we have families and clans, nor are the calamities and troubles which have befallen us unknown to thee. Oblige us now, and have mercy on us. May Allah reward thee!' It is related that among the nobles of those people the foster-uncle of his prophetic lordship and Zobayr B. Ssaru Sa\u2019dy, the spokesman of that tribe, made their appearance in the august assembly, and said: 'O apostle of God, we had entrusted H\u00e2reth B. Abu Shammar Ghus\u00e2ny and Nu\u2019m\u00e2n B. Mundhar with our government, which has at present fallen into thy hands. They dealt with us justly and mercifully; and now we expect from thy kind disposition that thou wilt restore to us the property and the captives thou hast taken among us, because some of these are thy foster-aunts on the paternal and the maternal side. As thou art the best security, withdraw not thy favour from us, have mercy on us unhappy ones, and abandon us to our affairs, because all affairs depend upon thy kindness.' His lordship the prince of existences replied: 'I delayed the division of the spoils, because I waited for your arrival and your negotiation on this subject. You have, however, arrived too late, and you see how many people are with me. Nevertheless, of all kinds of words, I love the true ones best. Make, therefore, your choice, and take back either your property or the captives.' They replied: 'We cannot abandon our families and children, taking sheep or camels instead of them, and cannot speak one word on this subject.' His lordship replied: 'I have reserved for you the share of the Bani A\u2019bd-ul-Muttalleb, and I shall ask the people to surrender their portion to you. When I hold the matutinal prayers you must rise and ask me to intercede for you with the Musalm\u00e2ns.' After the meridian devotions the Ho\u00e2z\u00e2n people did what the apostle had told them; and, first uttering praises to God with his pearl-dropping lips, his lordship addressed the congregation as follows: 'Your brothers have come to us penitent and as Musalm\u00e2ns. I have decided to restore to them their captives. Let, therefore, everyone who is inclined to comply do so; and let\neveryone who is not inclined to part with his share retain it; and we shall give him in lieu thereof a portion of the property which God the Most High has been pleased to bestow on us.' All, however, who were present in the assembly replied: 'O apostle of God, we unanimously and gladly agree to thy proposal.'\n\nIn some historical works it is recorded that when the tribe Ho\u00e2z\u00e2n asked in the assembly of the apostle of God for the restitution of their property, his lordship said: 'I give you my share and that of the Bani H\u00e2shem.' Hereon the Moh\u00e2jer rose and exclaimed: 'Our share belongs to the lord of prophecy.' These words were likewise repeated by the Anss\u00e2r; but Afza' B. H\u00e2bes, the leader of the [Bani] Salym, and O'tbah B. Hossyn Far\u00e2zah, the chief of the Bani Far\u00e2zah, said: 'We and our people do not agree with this statement.' A'bb\u00e2s B. Murd\u00e2s then said: 'I and the Bani Salym do not agree with this assertion.' The Bani Salym, however, accusing him of falsehood, said: 'Whatever belongs to us belongs to the apostle of God.' Then his holy and prophetic lordship said: 'To everyone who refuses [to part with his share] I shall give six camels for every prisoner [whom he will now surrender] from the first booty which God the Most High vouchsafes to bestow on us.' When the glorious companions beheld the endeavours of his lordship to get the prisoners released, they liberated all of them. Meanwhile his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014asked the Ho\u00e2z\u00e2n people: 'Where is M\u00e2lek B. A'wuf?' They said: 'In the fort of Ttayf.' His lordship continued: 'If he comes to us and makes a profession of Isl\u00e2m, we shall restore to him his family and property, and moreover give him a present of one hundred camels.' As soon as this news was communicated to M\u00e2lek, he joyfully made his appearance at Joghr\u00e2nah, was made happy by being allowed to kiss the feet of his lordship the apostle, and was adorned with the decoration of the Faith. His lordship not only kept his promise, but appointed M\u00e2lek to be governor of his own and of several other tribes, and then dismissed him.\nOn the 12th of the month Dhu-l-qa\u2019dah, in the eighth year [after the Flight], his lordship donned the *Ehr\u00e2m* for the pilgrimage, and departed from Joghr\u00e2nah to Mekkah, where he performed the ceremonies, appointed E\u2019t\u00e2b B. Asyd governor of the city, and left Moa\u2019adh B. Jabal there, with Abu M\u00fcsa Asha\u2019ry, to strengthen the foundations of the edifice of Isl\u00e2m, and to explain the laws and tenets of the religion, he having himself first also instructed them. He appointed Abu Sofy\u00e2n B. Harb to be governor of Bahr\u00e2n, which is situated in Yemen, and sent with him Kathyr B. A\u2019bdullah as his assistant. After terminating these affairs the prince of existences again departed from Mekkah, returned to Joghr\u00e2nah, distributed the spoils there, and arrived in Madinah at the end of the month Dhu-l-qa\u2019dah.\n\nOne of the events of this year was that four men of the Bani Tha\u2019lebah were made happy by being allowed to wait on the prince of this world, and to speak as follows: \u2018We are envoys from our people, and we have heard that Isl\u00e2m cannot be perfect without exile.\u2019 His lordship, however, replied: \u2018Be pious wherever you are, and your [profession of] Isl\u00e2m will be perfect, nor will it be the least injured on account of your not having undergone exile.\u2019 They were, by order of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014received in the house of Ramlah, the daughter of Alh\u00e2reth, and hospitably entertained for several days. Then every one of them was presented with four Oqyas of silver and dismissed.\n\nIn this year Zaynab, the daughter of the apostle of God, departed from the mansion of frailty to that of eternity. A bier was made for her, which was the first ever used in Isl\u00e2m. She had been the wife of Abu-l-a\u2019ass B. Rabyi\u2019, by whom she had two children, namely A\u2019li, whom his holy and prophetic lordship allowed to sit behind himself on the same camel when Mekkah was conquered, and thus entered the city. That boy had almost reached the age of puberty when he bade farewell to this perishable\n\n*Garb of a pilgrim, consisting of two sheets only.*\nworld. The other was the girl Am\u00e2mah, whom A\u2019li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014married after the decease of Fattimah Zohrah\u2014u. w. b.\u2014who had herself recommended him to do this. During this year Ebr\u00e2h\u00eem, the son of the prophet, was born, and when this news was conveyed to his lordship by Abu R\u00e2fi\u2019, he presented him with a slave and an Aqy\u00e2h.\\(^{377}\\) When the head of Ebr\u00e2h\u00eem was shaved his lordship distributed alms of silver, weighing as much as the hair, which was afterwards buried.\n\n**Ghazwah of Tabuk, and Events of the Ninth Year After the Flight.\\(^{378}\\)**\n\nAbu Sa\u2019yd Samn\u00e2ny\u2014Allah have mercy on him!\u2014has narrated in some of his books that, after the Ghazwah of Honayn and the division of spoils, the apostle of God returned to Madinah, where he arrived on Friday, the 25th Dhu-l-qa\u2019dah, and appointed, towards the end of the month Moharram of the ninth year, certain men to collect the legal alms from the Arab tribes who had recently embraced Isl\u00e2m, and they brought the required amount to Madinah. One of these officials was Boryd B. Alhassyb, who had been despatched to the tribes Foq\u00e2r and Aslam; others, however, mention in his stead Ka\u2019b B. M\u00e2lek. A\u2019l\u00e2d B. Bashar was sent to the Qur\u00e2rah, Dzoh\u00e2k B. Sofy\u00e2n to the Bani Kallab, R\u00e2fi\u2019 B. Muktah to the Johaynah, and Bashar B. Sofy\u00e2n Ka\u2019by to the Bani Ka\u2019b. At the time when the last-named individual met the Bani Ka\u2019b they were assembled near a watering-place with the Bani Tamym. Bashar numbered the cattle of the former, and began to take the amount required for the legal alms; the latter, however, on account of their great envy and meanness, and because the number appeared to them to be too great, asked: \u2018Why is it necessary to give so much property to Muhammad?\u2019 The Bani Ka\u2019b, however, re-\n\n\\(^{377}\\) This is the name of the sheep, or other animal, sacrificed during the first week after the birth of an infant.\n\n\\(^{378}\\) Began on April 20, A.D. 630.\nplied: 'Because our tribe follows Muhammad and has accepted his religion, according to which it is a duty to pay legal alms.' Then the Bani Tamym grasped their swords and arrows, saying: 'We swear by Allah that this tax-gatherer shall not take a single camel away from this place.' And to Bashar they said: 'Do not be going around these camels.' Therefore, Bashar acted according to the proverb, 'Who saves his head is a gainer,' preferred flight to permanency, hastened on the wings of speed to Madinah, and reported what he had experienced from the Bani Tamym. His lordship then said to his friends: 'Who of you will take vengeance on the Bani Tamym?' Hereon O'tbah B. Hossyn Far\u00e2zy swore an oath, and exclaimed: 'I shall go after the Bani Tamym, and not return unless I take them and bring them to thee.' When his lordship perceived the readiness and inclination of O'tbah to undertake that task, he ordered a detachment of cavalry, consisting of fifty men, to accompany him, none of them being of the Moh\u00e2jer or Anss\u00e2r. O'tbah started with the troopers towards the rebels, marching during the night and lurking concealed in the day. In this manner they reached in due time the country of the Bani Tamym, whose dwellings, however, they found untenanted by combatants. They accordingly began to foray and to plunder them, whereon they returned to Madinah with eleven women, ten men, and thirty children, whom they had captured, and all of whom were accommodated in appropriate places by order of his lordship the refuge of termination. A number of the Bani Tamym, such as Afza' B. H\u00e1bes, A'tt\u00e2rid B. H\u00e1jab, Warq\u00e2 B. Mundhar, Na'yym B. Sa'd, A'mru B. Alashham, and Qays B. Sa'd, proceeded [a short time afterwards] to Madinah in search of the people abducted from them, whom they visited first, as soon as they arrived in that blessed country, and afterwards proceeded to the mosque of the apostle of God. At that time the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014happened to be in the apartment of A'ayshah, resting himself and slumbering. Being ignorant in what room the apostle of God was, the Bani Tamym knocked,\nembarrassed as they were, at every door they passed, exclaiming: 'O Muhammad, come out!' Ball\u00e2l and the people of the mosque endeavoured to quiet them, but ineffectually, till at last his lordship awoke, and coming out, asked: 'What is the matter with these people, that they disturb my sleep?' When his lordship was returning to his august room, after holding matutinal prayers, the Bani Tamym, intercepting his way, said: 'Thy companions have taken away our wives and children without any hostility on our part.' It is related that his lordship said to them neither yea nor nay, but returned to his blessed chamber, where he prayed and then returned to the mosque. On that occasion Afza' B. H\u00e2bes, of the Bani Tamym, spoke as follows: 'O Muhammad, allow me to speak, for praise to thee is an ornament, and reproof ignominious.' His lordship the best of men\u2014u. w. b.\u2014replied: 'Thou hast lied; for to praise God is an ornament, and to revile Him is ignominious. But what is your purpose?' They assented to what he had said, and continued: 'We have brought the poet and orator of our people to eulogize thee.' His lordship replied: 'I need no poets nor laudations. Say, however, what you want.' Accordingly Warq\u00e2 B. Mundhar said to A'tt\u00e2rid B. Hajab, who was their most eloquent man and speaker: 'Rise, and deliver the harangue.' A'tt\u00e2rid then got up, spoke some words in praise of God the Most High, and then expatiated on the excellency and nobility of the tribe Bani Tamym. When he had finished his speech, the son of the firmament of apostleship, from whose august forehead Jupiter\\textsuperscript{379} was borrowing felicity, ordered Th\u00e2bet B. Qays B. Shamm\u00e2s the Anss\u00e2ry to reply to his elocution, of which duty the latter acquitted himself with the greatest eloquence by first pronouncing the laudation of the Omnipotent Creator, and then enumerating the qualities and virtues of the Moh\u00e2jer and Anss\u00e2r, in conformity with the requirements of the\n\n\\textsuperscript{379} This is a figure of speech alluding to A'tt\u00e2rid, which means Mercury, to whom Jupiter is superior, but the prophet infinitely more so, because even Jupiter was borrowing felicity from him.\noccasion. After Th\u00e2bet had terminated his reply to A\u2019tt\u00e2rid, Warqa, the poet of the Bani Tamym, rose and recited some distichs. After that Has\u00e2n obtained leave to speak from his lordship, and declaimed some verses, which elicited the approbation of A\u2019tt\u00e2rid. Afza\u2019 B. H\u00e2bes also recited a few distichs, to which Has\u00e2n replied. When the interlocutions on both sides had ceased, Afza\u2019 B. H\u00e2bes said: \u2018I swear by Allah that Muhammad is aided with victory from the invisible world, because no favour is withheld from him. His speaker is more eloquent than ours, and his poet is more accomplished than ours.\u2019 The people of Tamym repented, became obedient, and the caskets of their hearts were illuminated by the light of guidance, and the blessed verse, \u2018[As to] those who call unto Thee from without the inner apartments the greater part of them do not understand [the respect due to Thee],\u2019\\(^{380}\\) was revealed with reference to them. His holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014said to Qays B. A\u2019assum: \u2018This is the prince of the desert;\u2019 presented those people with abundant gifts, and liberated their captives.\n\nOne of the events of this year was that his lordship the best of men sent A\u2019li B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb with one hundred troopers to the tribe Bani Tt\u00e2y to destroy the idol-temple of Falas, which was in their country. The companions attended the stirrups of this exalted personage, started, and reached one morning the Tt\u00e2y tribe without the cognizance of the latter. They began the work of plunder and demolition by burning the temple and razing it. The professors of Isl\u00e2m obtained much booty, as well as a great number of camels; but H\u00e2t\u00eem Tt\u00e2y, the chief of the people, who is so well known that he need not be described in this place, fled and took refuge in Syria. After A\u2019li the Commander of the Faithful had separated one-fifth of the spoils, he distributed the remainder among the glorious companions. The daughter, however, of H\u00e2t\u00eem, who was a beautiful woman, he did not allot to anyone, but conveyed to Madinah, and kept her in the house where it was\n\n\\(^{380}\\) Qur\u00e2n, ch. xlix. 4.\ncustomary to lodge prisoners. One day, when his holy and prophetic lordship was walking to the mosque, the daughter of H\u00e1ttim stepped out from the house, accosted him on the road, and said: 'O apostle of God, my father has perished, and my protector has disappeared. Have mercy on me, and God will have mercy on thee.' The apostle of God asked: 'Who is thy protector?' She said: 'My brother A'dy.' He rejoined: 'That man is a fugitive from Allah and from His prophet.' Having uttered these words, he hastened to his destination. Next day, when his lordship passed by, the daughter of H\u00e1ttim reiterated her petition, but received the same answer. The third day, when he passed near the door of that house, the daughter of H\u00e1ttim advanced, in spite of her despair and hopeless condition, saying: 'O apostle of Allah, I am the daughter of the prince and chief of my tribe. My father has departed to the eternal world, and my brother has fled to Syria. Have mercy on me and liberate me, that God the Most High and Glorious may have mercy on thee.' This time her petition was responded to, and his lordship made arrangements for surrendering her to a number of her neighbours on their arrival in Madinah, which actually took place after the expiration of a few days, his lordship investing her with a garment of honour, bestowing on her various benefits, and rejoicing her with many favours, he gave her permission to depart with that company wherever she liked. The daughter of H\u00e1ttim departed, however, to Syria, where she met A'dy B. H\u00e1ttim, blamed him in many ways, and related to him her adventures; and when A'dy was discussing with his sister the propriety of meeting his lordship the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014she replied: 'Muhammad is either a prophet or a king, and in either case it is incumbent on thee to visit him.' This chief of the Tt\u00e1y tribe accordingly travelled to Madinah, where he arrived when his lordship happened to be in the mosque. When he entered the former asked him: 'Who art thou?' He replied: 'A'dy B. H\u00e1ttim Tt\u00e1y.' A mosque, however, not being a fit place to converse with a professor of\nidolatry, his lordship rose, returned to his sacred mansion, and was followed by A\u2019dy. On the road a feeble old woman met and stopped the apostle of God, and conversed a long time with him till he satisfied her wishes. When A\u2019dy beheld this great condescension on the part of the seal of prophets\u2014u. w. b.\u2014he said to himself: \u2018This is a characteristic of prophets and apostles.\u2019 After the apostle of God had terminated his conversation with the old woman he walked to his sacred habitation, which he entered, and threw down a bolster of goat-leather stuffed with fibres of the date-tree for A\u2019dy to sit upon, saying: \u2018Take a seat in this place.\u2019 A\u2019dy refrained at first, but complied at last, on account of the entreaties of the apostle of God; and when he to whom the words Lao l\u0101ka\\(^{381}\\) had been addressed took his place on the bare ground A\u2019dy said to himself: \u2018This act is also not one of kings and sovereigns, but one of the good qualities of prophets and of apostles.\u2019 After both had sat down the lord of apostleship said: \u2018O A\u2019dy, thou hast professed such and such a religion and sect, but hast done such and such an act which is not licit in thy religion and sect.\u2019 By these words A\u2019dy was convinced that his lordship was an inspired prophet, and the latter continued: \u2018O A\u2019dy, perhaps the smallness of the means and the greatness of the necessities of the Musalm\u00e2ns hinders thee from professing Isl\u00e2m. I swear by Allah that riches will soon become so plentiful among them that there will be no persons found to take possession of them. Or perhaps the great number of the opponents and the paucity of the professors of Isl\u00e2m prohibit thee from embracing it? I swear by God that if thy life is prolonged thou wilt see the professors of Isl\u00e2m very numerous and their enemies very inconsiderable, so that even a woman will be able to mount a camel and to arrive from Q\u00e2desyah to circumambulate the Ka\u2019bah, and will fear no one except God the Most High and His prophet. Or perhaps, because thou seest the power and government in the hands of the foes\n\n\\(^{381}\\) This phrase is Lao l\u0101ka m\u00e1 Khulikut-ull\u00e2j\u0101tika, and has been already explained. See footnote 37.\nof our religion, thou art unwilling to embrace it? I swear by God that the time is at hand when thou wilt hear of the white castles of the country of Babel having been conquered by the Musalmans.'\n\nIt is related of A'dy, that he said: 'After the apostle of God had uttered the above words, he invited me to make a profession of Isl\u00e1m, whereon I was adorned with the decoration of the Faith, and after the demise of the prophet I lived to see the fulfilment of two of the predictions he had made. One of them was the conquest of the castles, and the other the travelling of a lone woman to Mekkah, and I have no doubt that the third will also be fulfilled.' Let it, however, not remain concealed from the intelligent reader, that A'dy was made happy by kissing the feet of his lordship in the tenth year after the Flight, but for the sake of the context this conversion has been [now] inserted.\n\nOne of the events of this year was that during it his holy and prophetic lordship swore an oath that he would, during one month, not have any intercourse or association with his spouses. For this oath various reasons have been assigned, and one of them is as follows: On a certain day the apostle condescended to enter the apartment of Hafssah, the daughter of O'mar B. Alkhatt\u00e2b, who had, however, on that day, by permission of the apostle of God, left the house on a visit to her father, and the house being empty, his lordship took in his concubine, the Copt M\u00e1ryah, and had sexual connection with her. Meanwhile Hafssah returned from her father's house, found the door of the room locked, and was compelled to wait till his lordship opened it and came out. When Hafssah found what had taken place [in her absence] she began to weep, and said: 'O apostle of God, holdest thou sexual connection with a slave-girl in my absence and on my bed?' The prophet, noticing the agony of Hafssah, asked: 'Art thou willing that I should make [intercourse with] M\u00e1ryah unlawful to me?' She replied: 'I am willing.' Accordingly his lordship made her society illicit to himself, but ordered Hafssah to keep the matter secret, which she promised to do for the\nsake of expediency. But when his lordship the apostle of God went away, she could no longer conceal her joy, and communicated the secret to A'ayshah in the following words: 'O A'ayshah, glad tidings to thee. The prophet will henceforth abstain from having intercourse with the Coptic slave-girl.' Accordingly, when A'ayshah was made happy by waiting on his holy and prophetic lordship, she said to him ironically: 'O apostle of God, have intercourse with the Coptic slave-girl during my turn, so that the time of thy other wives may not be taken up with her.' Meanwhile Jebrail descended with the verses of the Chapter of Prohibition,\\(^{382}\\) in consequence whereof his lordship said to Hafssah: 'Have not I told thee not to reveal this secret to anyone, and not to divulge it?' Hafssah asked: 'Who has informed thee of this?' His lordship rejoined: 'The omniscient and all-seeing God.'\\(^{383}\\) As he had, on account of the above event, been reproached by several of his wives, he was displeased, and refrained from associating also with the others during one month, in order to punish them all. Another cause for this proceeding was that the mothers of the Faithful [i.e., the wives of Muhammad] had asked his lordship the apostle of the Lord of the universe for various sums of money to purchase garments which could not be easily procured, and in proof of this [disagreement between the prophet and his wives] it may be adduced that one day Abu Bakr Ssiddyq arrived at the door of the holy and prophetic mansion, where he perceived a number of the companions sitting, none of whom had obtained the felicity of an interview [with the prophet]. Ssiddyq, however, obtained admission, and O'mar B. Alkhattab, who had after him reached the door of the august chamber, was likewise admitted to the honour of kissing the hands of his lordship. On that occasion grief and pain had so overpowered\n\n\\(^{382}\\) Quran, ch. lxvi, bears this title.\n\n\\(^{383}\\) Ibid., v. 3. 'When the prophet entrusted as a secret unto one of his wives a certain accident, and when she disclosed the same and Allah made it known unto him; and when he had acquainted her therewith, she said: 'Who hath discovered this unto thee?' He answered: 'The knowing the sagacious Allah hath discovered [it] unto me.'\nthe most noble mind of the favourite of Allah the Most High, on account of the various claims of his wives who were the mothers of the Musalm\u00e2ns, that he spoke to no one. F\u00e2r\u00fbq, who knew the state of the matter and desired to make his lordship laugh, therefore said: \u2018O apostle of God, recently my wife, the daughter of Kh\u00e2rejah, asked me for some money, whereon I rose and struck her on the neck; and I wish thou hadst beheld the scene.\u2019 The apostle of God smiled at the words of O\u2019mar and said: \u2018My wives are on my neck. They ask for money, and want things which I do not possess.\u2019 These words so excited Ssiddyq Akbar that he rose and struck the neck of [his daughter] A\u2019ayshah with his fist, and F\u00e2r\u00fbq, imitating him, gave also a blow to his own daughter, Hafssah, both reproving their daughters in the following strain: \u2018Are you asking from the apostle of God things which he does not possess?\u2019 Hereon A\u2019ayshah and Hafssah swore an oath that they would never ask the prophet for anything he did not possess. Nevertheless, as his wives troubled him more than he could endure, his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014separated himself from them, sojourned one month in the upper room of his mosque, keeping at the door a slave, Ry\u00e2h by name, whom he ordered to admit no one without permission. When the news had spread in Madinah that the prophet had divorced his wives, every one of the companions who heard it visited the mosque.\n\nIt is related of F\u00e2r\u00fbq that he said: \u2018When I heard this rumour I hastened to the mosque, where I beheld a number of the companions seated near the pulpit and weeping. I remained with them for a while, but deep grief overpowered me, so I got up, went to the room of the mosque, and asked Ry\u00e2h to procure me an interview [with the prophet]. He attempted to do so several times, but in vain, and received no answer. I therefore said in a loud voice: \u201cRy\u00e2h, I believe the apostle of God thinks I have come to intercede for the crime of Hafssah. I swear by God that if he tells me to strike off her head I shall not disobey his orders!\u201d\nSaying these words, I departed, but suddenly heard Ry\u00e2h exclaiming: \"O'mar, come; thou hast obtained admittance.\" I then returned, entered, saluted him, and said before taking a seat: \"O apostle of God, hast thou divorced thy wives?\" He replied: \"No,\" whereon I uttered the Takbyr in a loud voice.' Solmah says: 'When the sound of the Takbyr reached our house, we knew what he had said to the apostle of God, and what answer he had received.'\n\nIn short, after twenty-nine days had elapsed since the departure of his lordship the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014he left the room of the mosque and entered the house of A'ayshah, who met that prince, saying: 'O apostle of God, thou hast sworn an oath that thou wilt not return to us before a month has elapsed, but since the time of thy departure only twenty-nine days have as yet expired.' His lordship replied: 'Sometimes a month has twenty-nine days.' The writer of these pages observes that this matter has also been recorded in other ways in voluminous books.\n\nDuring this year the lapidation of Sabya'h A'ameryah took place, which happened as follows: Three years before the just-mentioned date an A'ameryah woman made in the august assembly of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014a confession of having committed adultery, and requested him to judge her according to the religion, to purify her from her sin. His lordship answered: 'Return; pray to Allah for pardon, and trust to His mercy if you sincerely repent.' Sabya'h continued: 'O apostle of God, desirest thou to turn me away as thou hast sent away such-and-such a woman, seeing that I am pregnant from adultery?' He asked: 'Art thou with child from adultery?' She said: 'Yes.' His lordship continued: 'Wait till the delivery takes place.' She was thereon given in charge of one of the Anss\u00e2r till she gave birth to a child. When that event had taken place it was reported to the apostle of God\u2014u. w. b.\u2014who said: 'We cannot stone her now, considering that her infant is young, and there is no one to suckle it.' Some time afterwards Sabya'h weaned the child,\nput a piece of bread into its hand, brought it thus into the august assembly, and requested the law of the religion to be put in force. His lordship then gave the child of Sabya\u2019h to a Musalm\u00e1n, and ordered her to be placed into a pit up to the breast, whereon he gave the signal for lapidation. Kh\u00e1led B. Alwol\u00fdd thereon approached Sabya\u2019h in front, and struck her with a stone; but some drops from the wound thus inflicted having touched his face, Kh\u00e1led cursed her. His lordship, however, quieted him, and said: \u2018I swear by that God in the power of Whose grasp my soul is, that Sabya\u2019h has repented; and that if the Tamgh\u00e1chy had done this penance he would have been forgiven.\u2019 When the bird of the soul of Sabya\u2019h flew to the gardens of paradise, the cage of her body was, by order of the lord of termination, prayed over and buried in another spot.\n\n**GHAZWAH OF TABUK.**\n\nSome have alleged that Tabuk is the name of a place between Hajar and the first limits of Syria; others, however, insist that it is the name of a fort; whilst others maintain that it is the name of a fountain, and that the army of Isl\u00e1m having terminated its march in that locality, the campaign became known by the name of the Ghazwah of Tabuk. The reason for undertaking this expedition was because a caravan had arrived in Madinah from Syria, bringing from that country oil and flour, as also the news that the Governor of Greece and ruler of that country had collected an army so numerous that the plains and mountains could scarcely hold it; that many Christians and Arabs had joined the [Byzantine] Greeks, and that they were all marching to Madinah.\n\nIn the *Raudzatu-l-\u0101hh\u0101b* it is recorded that biographers\u2014Allah have mercy on them!\u2014give the following reason for the Ghazwah of Tabuk: At that time a caravan had arrived from Syria with oil and white flour, bringing also the information that the Emperor of Greece, having\n\n---\n\n384 This word does not occur in dictionaries, but probably stands for Satan.\ncollected a large army, which was joined by the Arabs of Najd, Haz\u00e1n, Ghas\u00e1n, and other tribes, was marching to Madinah, and had already reached Bulq\u00e1r. According to another tradition, the Christian Arabs had written to [the emperor] Heraclius to the following effect: \u2018The country of the man who pretends to be a prophet has been overtaken by famine and dearth, the possessions of his adherents are destroyed, and his country might be easily taken.\u2019 Accordingly he [i.e., Heraclius] appointed one of the Greek chiefs, named Qob\u00e1d, with an army of forty thousand men to conquer Madinah. There is a tradition, that when this information was communicated to the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014a Jew said: \u2018O father of Q\u00e1sim, if thou art really a prophet, thou must go to Syria, because it is the country of the resurrection and of the prophets.\u2019 At any rate, however, the lord of apostleship [whether he intended to act according to this advice or not] ordered his companions to get ready for a march against the Greeks, and sent circulars round to the tribes, who had attained the honour of professing Isl\u00e1m, to be ready. His lordship, however, was always in the habit of keeping the destination of the army secret, lest the enemy might obtain information; but he made an exception in the Ghazwah of Tabuk, which he proclaimed, because the distance was great, the heat intense, the foes numerous, and provisions scarce, so that, considering all these circumstances, the people might come fully prepared. For this reason the army was called \u2018the host of trouble,\u2019 and historians, biographers, commentators, etc., narrate that the distress was so great that ten men had but one camel, which they rode by turns; the majority of the soldiers had no other provisions except old broken dates, barley full of weevils, and rancid grease. On that march water was so scarce that, despite the paucity of quadrupeds, the people were obliged to slaughter camels to moisten their lips with the water they obtained from them. The men had even been unwilling to start from Madinah, because the season\n\n385 Or, \u2018The distressed army.\u2019\nof the maturity of their dates was just approaching, and they desired to repose in the shade and to enjoy their fruits. Here ends the extract from the *Raudzatu-l-\u0101hb\u0101b*, which, according to the opinion of the author of these pages, contains numerous misstatements, the most flagrant whereof is that, according to which his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014disregarded the heat, the calamity of the famine, the scarcity of water, the dearth of provisions, and the unwillingness of his companions, and had undertaken this expedition solely on account of what the Jews told him, and had again returned from Tabuk without entering Syria. Therefore intelligent and learned persons will do well to omit that tradition from their statements and not to copy it. Greeting to him who follows [Divine] guidance.\n\nIn short, when the august decision to march on an expedition to Syria had become a fixed determination with the lord of existences\u2014u. w. b.\u2014he sent Borydah B. Alkadzyb to the Bani Salym to collect troops; he despatched Abu Dhar Ghuff\u0101ry to the Bani Ghuff\u0101r, and in the same manner he caused others of his companions to depart to their tribes for the same purpose. After that he appointed some companions to provide for the destitute warriors of the glorious army, and they assisted them according to their power. Abu Bakr, however, excelled all the other benefactors of the nation by spending his whole property for the sake of the religion of God; and O\u2019mar B. Alkhatt\u0101b considered himself happy to surrender one moiety of everything he possessed. It is related that when the apostle of God ascended the pulpit and invited the rich to aid in fitting out the Arab army and relieving the poor, he referred them to the rewards of the next world. O\u2019t\u1e25man B. O\u2019ff\u0101n, who was distinguished by his opulence among the glorious companions, arose and agreed to present one hundred camels, laden with provisions, to the destitute portion of the army. When his holy and prophetic lordship repeated his exhortation, O\u2019t\u1e25m\u0101n added one hundred camels more, which number he augmented at the third\ninvitation to three hundred. Some biographers have narrated that the same benefactor added one thousand mithq\u00e2ls of pure gold to the camels; others, however, assert that he engaged himself to provide for one third of the army, the whole of which amounted to thirty thousand men. Then his lordship the best of men said: 'Hereafter O'thm\u00e2n will never feel the want of property for what it has now effected.' In some books we read that when O'thm\u00e2n brought the thousand mithq\u00e2ls of gold into the joyous assembly of the apostle of God, his lordship said: 'O God, be pleased with O'thm\u00e2n B. O'ff\u00e2n, for I am pleased with him.'\n\nThere is a tradition that A'bdu-r-rahman B. A'wuf had brought a sum of four thousand dirhems to the apostle of God, and said: 'I possessed eight thousand dirhems, and I have brought one half of that sum, wishing to gain the approbation of Allah, but the other moiety I have left for [the use of] my family and children.' His lordship replied, with his wonderfully eloquent tongue: 'May the Most High bless thee for what thou hast given, and for what thou hast retained.' This wish of the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014was responded to, and the wealth of that man became so great, that when he departed from the perishable to the imperishable world, each of the four wives whom he left after his death received eighty thousand mithq\u00e2ls of gold for her share when the time of mourning had elapsed. All the noble Anss\u00e2r and Moh\u00e2jer also disbursed large sums of money, and many ladies parted with their trinkets and ornaments to fit out the army. When all the troops were in readiness, his holy and prophetic lordship assembled and reviewed them outside of Madinah, in the place called Th\u00e2ny\u00e2tu-l-wod\u00e2a', on which occasion he appointed Abu Bakr to be Commander-in-chief and Em\u00e2m of the army, which, however, a number of hypocrites, and also three Musalm\u00e2ns, refused to join.\n\nIt is related that A'bdu'llah B. Abu Sal\u00fbl, the hypocrite, came out from Madinah with his confederates and encamped at Dhab\u00fbb, but again returned with a number of hypocrites\nand Jews as soon as his holy and prophetic lordship had marched away from Th\u00e2ny\u00e2tu-l-wod\u00e2a\u2019, and said: \u2018Muhammad has gone to fight the Greeks, and thinks it will be an easy matter; but I swear by God that I am of opinion that his companions will be scattered about the world as prisoners, dragging their yokes and fetters.\u2019 When the retreat of A\u2019bdullah had been brought to the august notice of his holy and prophetic lordship, he said: \u2018Had he been knowing, he would not have stayed away from us.\u2019 Another company of hypocrites associated with the army in that campaign for the sake of plunder; but with reference to their arrival and return unfavourable reports became current, which shall be narrated if it pleaseth God the Most High. It is related that when the apostle of Allah\u2014u. w. b.\u2014marched from Madinah he left A\u2019li B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb there to watch over the mothers of the Musalm\u00e2ns; but as the hypocrites of that city had said, \u2018Muhammad has not taken A\u2019li with him, because he is on bad terms with him,\u2019 the Commander of the Faithful went after his lordship as soon as he had heard the gossip of the hypocrites and heretics, and obtained the felicity of an interview in the place called Jarf, where he explained what had taken place, and wished to participate in that campaign, but his lordship replied: \u2018O A\u2019li, art thou willing to stand in the same relation to me as Har\u00fbn [Aaron] stood to M\u00fbsa [Moses], only that there will be no other prophet after me?\u2019\n\nIt is certain that in Th\u00e2ny\u00e2tu-l-wod\u00e2a\u2019 the lord of apostleship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014distributed the standards, and conferred the great banner on Abu Bakr Ssiddyq, another on Zobayr B. Ala\u2019ww\u00e2m, and another on Awus. The flags of the Khazraj he bestowed on Asad B. Alkhattyr and on Abu Duj\u00e2jah the Anss\u00e2ry. When the army was reviewed in that locality it was found to amount to thirty thousand men, as mentioned above. Some allege that it consisted of eighty, and a few assert that it numbered one hundred thousand combatants, ten thousand of whom were mounted on horses, and that they had twelve thousand camels with them. In\nthis expedition Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd commanded the vanguard, Abu Jaud Ttolhah B. A\u2019bdullah the right, and A\u2019bdu-r-rahman B. A\u2019wuf the left wing. After the army had started from Th\u00e2ny\u00e1tu-l-wod\u00e2a\u2019, a number of soldiers deserted in every halting-place, so that the friends and companions used to say, \u2018Such-and-such a man has returned;\u2019 but that prince replied: \u2018Do not mind him. If there be any good in him, the Most High will probably cause him to join you again; but if not, Allah has shown you a favour by delivering you of his company.\u2019\n\nWhen the army had marched the required distance it arrived at Tabuk, where it halted two months by order of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014resting from the toil and fatigue of the evening and morning [marches]. Meanwhile it became evident that the rumours current in Madinah about the intention of the Greeks to attack the professors of Isl\u00e2m had no foundation whatever; nor could the least sign of the Qayssar or of the Greek army be perceived. Accordingly his lordship the refuge of prophecy\u2014u. w. b.\u2014consulted the chief Anss\u00e2r and Moh\u00e2jer about invading Syria and attacking the inhabitants thereof; and among the companions O\u2019mar B. Alkhatt\u00e2b rose, saying: \u2018O apostle of God, if thou orderest us to proceed in that direction we shall obey, because we are all in attendance on thy heaven-aspiring stirrup.\u2019 His lordship replied: \u2018If I had received [Divine] orders I would not have consulted you.\u2019 O\u2019mar continued: \u2018O apostle of Allah, the Emperor of Greece has great armies, numerous as locusts, provided with all the appliances of war, and they are assembled in the shadow of his sovereign power. There is not a single Musalm\u00e2n among them; thou hast this year arrived near them; the rumour of thy power and dignity must have spread in that country, so that fear and trepidation have overpowered the Greeks. Nevertheless, if thou returnest this time and undertaketh the war next year, it will be more suitable.\u2019 This opinion of F\u00e2riq the greater being in conformity with that of the prophet, his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014concluded to march back to Madinah.\nIt is related that when Heraclius, the Byzantine emperor, heard that the apostle of God had arrived in Syria and was encamped in Tabuk, he appointed a man of the Bani Ghusan to pay a visit to the camp of the Musalmans and to bring information about the qualities and characteristics of the lord of prophecy\u2014u. w. b.\u2014such as the redness of his eyes, the seal of prophecy, the giving and receiving of alms, and the like. The man obeyed, went to Tabuk, and returned to Heraclius after having made full inquiries, and described to the Qayssar all the properties and circumstances of the apostle of God. Heraclius thereon assembled the nobles and magnates of Greece, and ordered them to abandon Christianity and to embrace the sublime religion; but the Greeks were so amazed at the words of the Qayssar that they feared his sovereignty was drawing to an end; therefore he no longer pressed his views upon them, but secretly made his profession of the Faith, and was blessed with felicity in both worlds.\n\nKh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd goes to Daumatu-j-jandal.\n\nAt the time his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014was staying in Tabuk he ordered Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd to march with four hundred and twenty troopers against Akydar B. A\u2019bdul-melik, the governor of Daumatu-j-jandal, and Kh\u00e2led replied: \u2018O apostle of God, sendest thou me among the Bani Kallab with a few companions?\u2019 That prince, however, replied with his wonderfully eloquent tongue: \u2018Thou wilt probably soon capture Akydar in the hunting ground without the toil of war.\u2019 Kh\u00e2led accordingly obeyed, and marched to the fort of Daumatu-j-jandal, and arrived one night in a fine moonshine in the vicinity of the fort of Akydar, who happened at that time to be engaged on the top of it in eating and drinking wine with his spouse. On that occasion a [wild] mountain-cow happened to arrive near the gate of the fort, which it commenced to butt against with her horns. The lady, whose name was Rab\u00e2b, approached the margin of the platform, and perceiving what was going on beneath, she said to her\nhusband: 'Hast thou ever beheld such a sight?' He replied: 'No.' Rab\u00e2b further asked: 'Hast thou ever allowed such game to escape?' He said: 'No.' Then Akydar, being very fond of hunting mountain-cows, came down from the terrace of the kiosk, and ordered a horse fit to pursue the cow to be saddled, whereon he departed with his brother and several other men to chase the mountain-cow. Not aware that he was about to fall into the hands of Kh\u00e2led, and into the grasp of the hunter of fate, Akydar left the fort, and the cow fled, he pursuing her on horseback. Kh\u00e2led, however, who had been watching his opportunity, attacked and captured Akydar, whose companions ran away and took shelter in the fort, which Modzb\u00e2r, another brother of Akydar, then put in a state of defence.\n\nAs his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014may Allah bless him and his family\u2014had ordered Kh\u00e2led to bring Akydar alive in case he should capture him, unless he refused, Kh\u00e2led said to him: 'If thou art willing, I grant thee thy life, and shall convey thee to his lordship the refuge of prophecy on condition that thy people deliver the keys of the fort to me and open the gate thereof, and that thou surrenderest to me one thousand camels, eight hundred horses, four hundred spears, and four hundred cuirasses, whereon I shall allow thee to retain thy fort as before.' Akydar complied with the proposal of Kh\u00e2led. His brother first refused, but at last opened the gate of the fort, and both brothers hastened, in the company of Kh\u00e2led, to kiss the feet of the Lord of apostleship\u2014m. A. b., etc.\u2014According to one tradition, the brothers attained the felicity of professing the Faith as soon as they had arrived in Madinah, but according to another, that prince settled the poll-tax\\(^{386}\\) upon them, and allowed them to depart. But Allah knows best.\n\n\\(^{386}\\) This is the Jazyah paid by Christians, Jews, etc., in Musalm\u00e2n countries.\nThe Events which took place during the Expedition of Tabuk, and other Affairs.\n\nIt is recorded in biographical works that Dharya'h B. Th\u00e2bet, and a number of men who were as great hypocrites as himself, waited during the march one day on the apostle of God\u2014m. A. b., etc.\u2014and conversed [in secret] among themselves as follows: 'Just see, this man wants to conquer the forts and districts of the country of Syria, which is not very likely to happen.' Then Ashja'yi, who was among them, said: 'I swear by God that I should like each of us to receive one hundred lashes as a punishment for this opinion, and that some verses of the Qur\u00e2n might be revealed with reference to us, and to our wicked conversation.' Meanwhile the prince of existences had been divinely informed from the invisible world concerning the blamable sentiments of the hypocrites, and said to O'mm\u00e2r Y\u00e2ser: 'Save that company, for they are burning; ask them what they have just now said, and if they deny it, inform them of the words they have uttered.' O'mm\u00e2r obeyed, and reported to those men what his holy and prophetic lordship had said, whereon they became confused and ashamed. They went to the apostle of God, begged his pardon, and Dharya'h B. Th\u00e2bet pretended that they had spoken in fun only. Hereon the blessed verse, 'If you ask them, they will answer: We have been joking and playing. Say: You have derided Allah and His prophet,'\\(^{387}\\) was revealed. It is related that Mohsan was among the number of those whom he [i.e., the prophet] forgave, and that he prayed to God to allow him to attain the honour of martyrdom, and that his grave should remain unknown. The arrow of this petition struck the target of response, for Mohsan was killed in the battle of Yam\u00e2mah, and his body was not found afterwards.\n\nAnother wonderful event [in the campaign of Tabuk] was that when the army of Isl\u00e2m, who attended on the heaven-aspiring stirrups of his lordship the master of\n\n\\(^{387}\\) Qur\u00e2n, ch. ix. 63.\nexistences\u2014u. w. b.\u2014arrived in Wady-l-qara, and halted near the cave [lit. chamber] of Tham\u00fbd, that prince forbade the people to drink the water of that locality, or to perform therewith the religious ablution, and ordered them to tie up the knees of the camels. All the Musalm\u00e2ns obeyed, except one individual of the Bani Sua\u2019dah, who had gone away to answer a call of nature, and another of the same tribe who had left his tent and departed in search of a stray camel. The first suffered from suffocation, and the second was thrown by the wind on mount Tt\u00e2y; whilst during that night the wind was blowing hard, the man who suffered from suffocation [asthma?] was conveyed into the miracle-working presence of the best of men, and in consequence of the orisons of that prince, God the Most High and Glorious delivered him of his complaint. When the apostle of God\u2014u w. b.\u2014had returned to Madinah, the owner of the camel was, by the [people of Mount] Tt\u00e2y, brought there as a present.\n\nAnother miracle was that when the Musalm\u00e2ns had passed Hajar, and were complaining to his lordship that they had no water, he turned his face towards the Qiblah of prayer, lifted up his blessed hands, whereon in that clear atmosphere and hot weather clouds made their appearance in various directions, and having united with each other, poured forth water enough to slake the thirst of all the companions and to fill all the water-bags. On account of his great joy and gladness the apostle shouted the Takhyr, whereon the clouds again vanished, the sun appeared, and that prince exclaimed: \u2018I testify that I am the apostle of Allah.\u2019 It is related that on this occasion the Musalm\u00e2ns said to a man who was a noted hypocrite: \u2018Come, make a sincere profession of the Faith, for now thou hast no excuse.\u2019 That shameless fellow, however, replied: \u2018Is there anything extraordinary in a cloud passing and raining?\u2019\n\nAnother miracle was that the camel of the apostle of God had been lost in a certain halting-place, and that when some companions searched for it in the desert they met a Jew of the Bani Qaynuqaa\u2019, who had become a\nhypocrite after professing Isl\u00e2m, and whose name was Zayd. In this halting-place O\u2019mm\u00e2rah B. Hoz\u00e2m, who was a native of A\u2019q\u00e2bah, and had been present at Bedr, said: \u2018How is it that Muhammad gives news about heaven, and says that he is a prophet, but knows not where his she-camel is?\u2019 That very moment the prince of the children of Adam was by the light of prophecy informed of the above words, repeated them in his august assembly, and said to O\u2019mm\u00e2rah: \u2018By Allah, I know only that of which God the Most High informs me. Now God has revealed to me where my camel is. Go to such and such a W\u00e2dy, for my camel is there, and its bridle is fixed to a tree.\u2019 Several companions accordingly went to that W\u00e2dy, and discovered the she-camel in the position described by his lordship. When O\u2019mm\u00e2rah returned to his dwelling, he narrated the event to the people of the station, and one of them said: \u2018Before thy arrival Zayd had spoken such and such words [reviling the prophet].\u2019 Hereon O\u2019mm\u00e2rah immediately struck Zayd with his fist, and exclaimed: \u2018I was not aware that there was such a great calamity and wickedness in my house.\u2019 After that he expelled Zayd from his habitation and no more associated with him.\n\nAnother miracle was that during this march his holy and prophetic lordship said one day: \u2018To-morrow we shall reach the spring of Tabuk, but no one must touch the water thereof.\u2019 Mu\u2019adhar\u2014A. r. h.\u2014says: \u2018The next day we arrived there in the forenoon, but two men had preceded us, had drunk, and had thereby caused the water to disappear. His lordship asked them: \u201cHave you touched the water?\u201d They said: \u201cYes.\u201d Therefore the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014reproved these two individuals and cursed them. After that he ordered a little water to be taken from the spring, and to be put into a vessel, in which he washed his glorious hands and mouth. Then he poured the water back into the spring, and the water, which had been extremely scanty before, became very copious by this proceeding, so that the thirst of the whole army was slaked therewith.\u2019\nAnother miracle was the prediction uttered with reference to Abu Dhar Ghuff\u00e1ry, which happened as follows: This man had departed to Tabuk after his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014but as his camel became disabled on the road, he took his luggage on his back and continued the journey. When the apostle of God was halting in the station of Tabuk, Abu Dhar having been perceived at a distance, the companions reported that they had seen him approaching, whereon the apostle of God said: \u2018This is Abu Dhar.\u2019 When he had come nearer, [also] the companions recognised him, and exclaimed: \u2018We swear by God that this is Abu Dhar.\u2019 On his entering the assembly, that prince rose, welcomed him and said: \u2018May God the Most High have mercy on Abu Dhar, because he lives alone, will die alone, and will be buried alone.\u2019 Then he inquired about the circumstances of Abu Dhar, who stated the reason of his tardy arrival. It is related that O\u2019thm\u00e1n sent, during the time of his Khalifate, Abu Dhar away from Madinah to Ryza\u2014for a purpose which shall be related in these pages if it pleaseth Allah the Most High\u2014where he lived alone, isolated and separated from his friends, until he was overtaken by a mortal disease, having no one with him except his wife and slave. He said to them: \u2018When you have washed and shrouded my corpse, place it in a coffin on the public road, and say to the first company of camel-riders who shall happen to pass: \u201cThis is Abu Dhar, the companion of the apostle of God,\u201d whereon they will aid you to bury me.\u2019 His wife and slave obeyed his injunction, and the first company which passed the spot was one of Musalm\u00e1ns, with A\u2019bdullah B. Masu\u2019d\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and a number of persons from E\u2019r\u00e2q, who were going on pilgrimage to Mekkah. A\u2019bdullah asked about the bier, wept sore on being informed, and said: \u2018The apostle of God has spoken the truth that thou wilt live alone, die alone, and be buried alone.\u2019 Thereon some respectable men alighted from their camels and interred him. May God bless them all.\n\nAnother miracle was the prediction uttered with refer-\nence to A'bdullah Dhu Abaj\u00e2dyn, who was an orphan boy possessing no worldly goods, but was taken care of by his uncle, who lived in Hajar. When he grew up he became a possessor of camels, sheep, as well as of male and female slaves. In the time of ignorance he was called A'bdu-l-u'zza, but was always very desirous to pronounce the formula of monotheism, and to be enrolled among the attendants on the exalted threshold of prophecy. The fear, however, of his uncle, who was an obstinate idolater, restrained him a long time [from carrying out his intention], but he waited patiently; and when his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had terminated the campaign of Honayn and had again returned to Madinah, A'bdullah said to his uncle: 'I have for a long time been expecting thee to make a profession of Isl\u00e2m, but have hitherto perceived no signs of it. I for my part have no confidence in this perishable life, and I hope thou wilt allow me to utter the formula of the testimony, and to illuminate the casket of my heart with the light of monotheism.' His uncle, however, replied: 'I swear by God that if thou comest a Musalm\u00e2n and followest Muhammad, I shall take back everything I gave thee, and even deprive thee of thy Red\u00e2 and thy Iz\u00e2r, and turn thee away naked.' Dhu Abaj\u00e2dyn said: 'By Allah! I have abandoned idolatry, and I am going to be a Musalm\u00e2n. I shall believe in Allah and His prophet, renouncing all worldly possessions, which we must at last abandon by compulsion. Take all my goods and chattels.' After saying these words A'bdullah gave up all his property, threw away his Red\u00e2 and his Iz\u00e2r from his body, and went naked to the house of his mother, to whom he revealed his anxiety to embrace Isl\u00e2m, and asked for clothes. His mother gave him a striped carpet named Abaj\u00e2, which A'bdullah divided in twain, using one half as a Red\u00e2 and the other as an Iz\u00e2r. Thus he turned his steps, with the purest and sincerest motives, to the threshold of his lordship the Mussttafa, and took rest in the mosque of the apostle of God. When his lordship had\nterminated his prayers he conversed as usual with the people, and, his joy-boding eyes alighting on A\u2019bdullah, he asked him: \u2018Who art thou?\u2019 He replied: \u2018I am called A\u2019bdu-l-u\u2019zza, of such and such a tribe.\u2019 His lordship replied: \u2018Thy name will be Dhu Abaj\u00e4dyn. Lodge with us.\u2019 Accordingly A\u2019bdullah became a guest of that prince, and began to study the Qur\u00e2n, which he used to recite in the mosque with a loud voice. One day O\u2019mar B. Alkhatt\u00e2b said: \u2018O apostle of God, this Arab is reciting the Qur\u00e2n aloud, and disturbs the readings and devotions of the people.\u2019 But the prophet said: \u2018Let him, O\u2019mar, for he has come out as a confederate and exile for the sake of God and of His apostle.\u2019 At the time when the Musalm\u00e2ns were making preparations for the Ghazwah of Tabuk, A\u2019bdullah entered the august assembly, and said: \u2018O apostle of God, pray that I may become a martyr by fighting for the religion of God.\u2019 His lordship said: \u2018Go and bring a piece of bark.\u2019 Thereon A\u2019bdullah fetched a piece of bark from a date-tree, which the apostle tied to the arm of A\u2019bdullah, saying: \u2018O God Most High, I make his blood illicit to the infidels.\u2019 A\u2019bdullah said: \u2018O apostle of God, that was not my request.\u2019 His holy and prophetic lordship continued: \u2018When thou marchest forth with the intention of combating for the religion of God the Most High, thou wilt become affected with a febrile distemper, which will take thee out of this world, and thus make thee a martyr.\u2019 Accordingly, when A\u2019bdullah proceeded in attendance on the heaven-aspiring stirrups of his lordship the apostle to Tabuk, and the army, arriving there, rested itself, he was attacked by fever, and died in a couple of days. On the day of his interment Ball\u00e2l the Muedhdhin held a lamp in his hand, the lord of existences stepped into the grave, and Ssiddyq with F\u00e2ri\u00fbq lowered the corpse into it. After A\u2019bdullah had been buried his lordship the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014said: \u2018O God, I was pleased with him this night; be Thou also pleased with him.\u2019 A\u2019bdullah B. Masu\u2019d, having heard these words, said: \u2018Would to God I were the tenant of this grave.\u2019\nThe author of this work says that the manifest signs and great miracles worked by his holy and prophetic lordship \u2014 u. w. b. \u2014 during the Ghazwah of Tabuk were so numerous that this compendium cannot contain them, but that whoever may be desirous of becoming acquainted with them all ought to peruse biographical works.\n\nSARIAHS TO THE W\u00c2DY-URRAML\n\nIt is recorded in the Kashafu-l-ghummah that a man came to the apostle of God after the Ghazwah of Tabuk, and reported that an Arab tribe had assembled in the W\u00e2dy-urraml, with the intention of making a night attack on Madinah. The prophet hereon immediately ordered the companions to assemble, informed them of the case, and asked: \u2018Who of you will ward off this wicked attempt?\u2019 Then a number of the illustrious companions, as well as others, immediately expressed their pleasure at the news, and his lordship the best of men gave the flag to Ssiddyq, appointing him commander of the expedition which was to march against the enemy, who was in a low country, full of stones and trees, difficult of access. In short, Ssiddyq marched against the enemy according to the orders he had received, and reached the W\u00e2dy after duly traversing the distance, but when he was entering it the hypocrites rushed out, armed with swords and lances, attacked the Musalm\u00e1ns, some of whom attained the honour of martyrdom, and the rest fled back to Madinah. When the apostle of God was informed [of this defeat] he made a banner, gave it to F\u00e2r\u00fbq, and appointed him over a number of Musalm\u00e1ns, whom he sent to avenge themselves on the professors of opposition and heresy. O\u2019mar then hastened to his destination, and on his attempting to penetrate into the valley, the idolaters rushed out from among the rocks and trees, where they had lain in ambush, and attacked the Musalm\u00e1ns, who fled after some resistance [again] to Madinah. After this event A\u2019mru B. Ala\u2019ass, who was\n\n388 Meaning \u2018Forays\u2019\u2014in which Muhammad was not present\u2014\u2018to the Wady of Sand.\u2019\ndistinguished for cunning and deceit, spoke as follows: 'O apostle of God, send me against them, that I may deal with them according to the proverb, \"Stratagem is necessary in war,\" and that I may deceive the enemies.' His holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014complied with his request, appointed him over a company of Musalm\u00e2ns, and sent him against the opponents; but, on coming in contact with them, some Musalm\u00e2ns attained martyrdom, and the rest were [again] put to flight. Several days after the return of A'mru B. Ala'ass, his lordship prepared a standard for A'li the Commander of the Faithful, lifted up his hands to heaven, and poured forth his orisons for A'li with his wonderfully eloquent tongue. He also condescended to accompany A'li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014as far as the mosque Ahz\u00e2b, ordering Ssiddyq, F\u00e2r\u00fbq, and A'mru B. Ala'ass to follow and to obey him. Ali Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014feigned to march towards Arabian E'r\u00e2q, and passed by the W\u00e2dy-urraml; but after he had marched several stages he determined to attack the enemy, and hastened to his destination by a route which debouched into the W\u00e2dy. He marched during the night, and rested his men in the day aside from the road. When he had reached the neighbourhood of the habitations of the opponents, he ordered his forces to advance slowly, taking himself the lead in front. When A'mru B. Ala'ass perceived that the stratagems of A'li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014were likely to be crowned with success and victory, he intended to discomfit the expedition by speaking as follows to F\u00e2r\u00fbq and to Ssiddyq: 'In this route there are dangers to be apprehended from wild animals and rapacious beasts, wherefore it will be proper for us to make a night-attack upon the enemy from the upper part of the W\u00e2dy.' The two old men communicated this proposal to A'li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014but he rejected it. A'mru B. Ala'ass therefore said: 'O Musalm\u00e2ns, we cannot jeopardize our lives. Come, let us march in the higher portions of the W\u00e2dy.' The army of Isl\u00e2m, however, replied: 'The prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014having forbidden us to disobey A'li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014how can we listen\nto thy words and act according to them?' A'li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014considered the opinion of A'mru to be erroneous, and continued his march as before, till he arrived at the dawn of day in sight of the opponents, on whom he avenged himself according to his heart's desire. The author of the Kashaj'u-l-ghummah maintains that on this occasion the chapter 'The war-horses which run swiftly' was revealed, and that his lordship the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014informed his companions of the glad tidings of the victory. When A'li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014returned and arrived in the vicinity of Madinah, his lordship ordered his companions to meet Hayder [i.e., A'li] the Commander of the Faithful in solemn procession, and preceded them himself at a short distance, and as soon as the blessed eye of the receptacle of sovereignty alighted on the joy-bringing countenance of the owner of prophecy he alighted from his horse, but that prince said: 'Mount, O A'li, for God and the apostle of God are pleased with thee.' A'li the Commander of the Faithful began to weep for joy, and the apostle of Allah said: 'Had I not been apprehensive of the people saying of thee what they have said with reference to the Masyh [Messiah], namely, I'sa [Jesus], the son of Maryam, I would have uttered words, in consequence whereof thou wouldest not have passed near any company, but they would have picked up the earth from under thy feet.'\n\n**The Arrival of the Wof\u00fbd.**\n\nDuring this year [i.e., the ninth year after the Flight] when his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had returned from Tabuk, crowds upon crowds arrived from the various Arab tribes, were blessed by making a profession of the Faith, and made happy by meeting the apostle of God. The numbers of those persons amounted to such multitudes that this year was surnamed 'the year of the Wof\u00fbd.' It was the custom of his lordship the apostle, on the arrival\n\n---\n\n389 This is the title of Surah C. of the Qur\u00e2n.\n\n390 Wof\u00fbd is the plural of Wof\u00fbd, and means arrivals, comings, and figuratively deputations.\nof each Wofod, to don nice robes, to order his companions to dress in clean clothes, and to adorn themselves with costly garments. He also ordered the Wofud to be accommodated in good and clean houses, and to be entertained in the most hospitable manner. On their departure they were presented with gifts and provisions, so that they returned to their countries and dwelling-places full of joy and gratitude.\n\nAmong the number of the Wofud, who were during this year admitted to the felicity of the hand-kiss, was also the Wofod of the Bani Murrah, which took place as follows: Thirteen individuals of the tribe Murrah had arrived together, made a profession of Isl\u00e2m, and addressed the prophet as follows: 'O apostle of God, we are the kinsmen and relatives of thy people, because we are connected with the district [lit., flag] of the Bani Gh\u00e2leb.' His holy and prophetic lordship smiled at this assertion, and asked: 'What is the state of your country?' But as those people suffered from dearth and famine, they requested his lordship to pray for them. His lordship accordingly turned his face towards the Qiblah of petition and said: 'O God, water them with rain!' He then ordered Ball\u00e2l to rejoice every one of them with ten Oqyahs of silver, and honoured their chief, whose name was Hareth B. A'wuf, with a gift of twelve Oqyahs of silver. When that company had attained their purpose and returned to their tribe, they learned on inquiry that the very day when the above prayer had been uttered, a beneficent rain had actually fallen in their country.\n\nAnother Wofod was that of A'amer B. Ssa'ssa'h, which took place as follows: 'A'amer B. Attafyl B. Malek B. Ja'fer B. Kall\u00e2b and Arbad B. Rabya'h or Arbad B. Hatys\u2014according to two different traditions\u2014had arrived during this year with a company of the Bani A'amer in Madinah. But A'amer had previously made an arrangement with Arbad which he expressed in the following words: 'While I engage Muhammad in conversation thou must approach him from the rear, and relieve us of all our apprehensions\nby despatching him with thy sword.' When they entered the august assembly, A'amer said: 'O Muhammad, what will be my lot if I become a Musalm\u00e2n?' His lordship replied: 'That of Musalm\u00e2ns.' A'amer continued: 'Make me thy successor after thy demise.' His lordship said: 'That position cannot be attained by thy nation or tribe.' A'amer continued: 'If thou wilt not comply with my demand, then appoint me to be the commander and governor of the inhabitants of the desert.' But the apostle of God placed the hand of refusal upon the breast of his petition, and said: 'I shall make thee officer and commandant of a detachment of cavalry, and employ thee to fight for the religion of God.' A'amer said: 'I am at present the chief of such a company, and I swear by God that I shall go and collect an army of infantry and cavalry, numerous as locusts, to calculate the number whereof will exceed the powers of imagination, and shall attack thee there-with.' After uttering these words, A'amer departed from the august assembly with Arbad, whom he reproached for having omitted to do what he had promised, but Arbad replied: 'I swear by God that I intended to strike Muhammad with my sword, but thou wast between him and me.' When these two wicked men had gone away, his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014cursed them. His prayer met with the honour of response, so that A'amer as well as Arbad were punished for their wicked intentions and evil deeds; the latter was, by a decree of Divine providence, struck dead by lightning; and the former became affected with a gland swelling in his throat. Alighting in a journey at the house of a Salulyah woman, he said to himself: 'This gland is like the gland of the camel of death,' and again departing from the house of the woman, he mounted his horse, but departed to hell whilst on this journey.\n\nAnother Wofod was that of the Bani Asad, ten men of whom had arrived in Madinah, had become Musalm\u00e2ns, and, desiring their merit to become known, said: 'We have started on the journey in a year of famine and distress; we performed the journey without being attacked by foes,\nand have arrived in this country by our own free will and choice, and we have embraced Isl\u00e2m.' With reference to this event, the blessed verse, 'They upbraid thee that they have embraced Islam; rather Allah upbraidthe you that he hath directed you to the Faith if ye speak sincerely,' was revealed.\n\nAnother Wofod was that of the Bani Albak\u00e2, wherein also Moa'wiah B. Th\u00f4r B. A'bad B. Albak\u00e2, who was one hundred years old, is said to have been present with his son Bashar. Moa'wiah spoke to the world-adorning mind of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014blessing, etc.\u2014as follows: 'I request thee to place thy auspicious hand on some of the limbs of my son Bashar, who stands to me in the relation of a son to his father, and has treated me very kindly.' That prince accordingly touched his head and face, presented him with several goats, and pronounced a blessing upon them; and it is related that when famine and distress befell the country of the Bani Albak\u00e2, the people of Moa'wiah remained free from the affliction thereof.\n\nAnother Wofod was that of the Bani Najyb, thirteen men of which tribe arrived, bringing the legal alms due for their property and cattle. His holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014was highly pleased with their arrival, and issued orders for their accommodation in a good place. When they informed his lordship that they had brought their share of the Dzak\u00e2t, he replied: 'Take it back to your country and distribute it among the poor and needy.' They, however, rejoined: 'We have brought only what was over and above the necessities of the poor.' It is related that when the Wofod of the Bani Najyb made inquiries about all the duties and obligations of the religion, his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014granted them longer interviews, and was more kind to them than to other people. He also gave them more presents than to others, and asked them: 'Is there any one among you who has not received his gift?' They replied: 'There is a young man,\n\n301 Qur\u00e2n, ch. xlix. 17.\ninferior in age to all of us, and we have left him in our lodgings to take care of our baggage and cattle.' His lordship said: 'After you have returned to your quarters you must send that youth to me.' They did as they were bidden, and when the young man entered the august assembly, he said: 'O apostle of God, I am one of that company which has just waited on thee. Their necessities and requests have been responded to; please to comply also with my petition.' His lordship asked: 'What is thy request?' The youth continued: 'I swear by God that I have not left my country and arrived here with the intention of obtaining worldly goods from thee such as thou hast vouchsafed to bestow upon the others. But my reason for troubling thee is, that thou pray to God the Most High to wash off the volumes of my transgressions with the water of pardon, and to save, by the outpourings of forgiveness, this my body of clay from the fire of hell; also to relieve my heart of all covetousness for mundane possessions, and to make me content with poverty.' When his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014t. b. o. A. o. h. a. o. h. f.\u2014became aware of the high aspirations of this individual more exalted than those of his peers, he uttered the following prayer with his blessed mouth, which was the interpreter of Divine mysteries: 'O God, pardon him, have mercy on him, and cause his riches to dwell in his heart.' Then he presented him with an amount equal to the sum of what all his companions had received; whereon those men returned to their tribe. It is related that during the Hajjatu-l-wodaa' [the pilgrimage of valediction] his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014afterwards [again] met some of those individuals at Men\u00e0, inquired about the young man, and they replied: 'O apostle of God, we have never seen nor heard of a man more happy or noble than he, but in the balance of his aspirations the whole world, with all its contents, weighs not more than a gnat.' Though numberless Wof\u00fbd had arrived during this year in the honoured city of Madinah, only the above ones have been recorded in this work, lest it should become too prolix. Farewell.\nDeath of A'bdullah B. Abu Salul.\n\nIn the month Showal of the ninth year after the Flight, A'bdullah B. Abu Salul the hypocrite fell sick, and died in the month Dhu-l-qa'dah of the same year. While he was sick, his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014condescended to visit him, and on his deathbed his lordship said to him: 'I have warned thee not to love the Jews, but thou hast not followed my advice.' A'bdullah replied: 'Though Asa'd B. Zararah hated them, his enmity to them could not keep off death from him. O apostle of God, this is not the time for recriminations. The moment of my departure is at hand. I request thee to be kind enough to accompany my bier when I die, and to make me a present of a robe wherein to shroud me.' It happened that on this occasion the apostle of God\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had two robes on his body, one of which did not touch it, and which he intended to give to A'bdullah; the latter, however, requested him to present him with the nether one, and his lordship assented. He then said again: 'O apostle of God, I hope thou wilt pray near my bier, and wilt ask God to pardon my sins.' And his lordship agreed. Authors of biographies\u2014A. h. m. o. t.\u2014relate that the apostle of God\u2014u. w. b.\u2014was present when the corpse of Ebn Abu Salul was being washed and shrouded, conversing with his son, who was a sincere believer. When the bier of A'bdullah was conveyed to a place called Hanayr, his lordship rose to accompany it, and to pray over the body; O'mar, however, jumped up from his place, taking hold of the skirts of the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014saying: 'O apostle of God, wilt thou pray for him despite his having uttered such-and-such words on a certain day?' His holy and prophetic lordship replied: 'O'mar, let go my skirts.' But O'mar still continuing his solicitations, his lordship said: 'Option has been left to me to pray seventy times for their pardon or not. Had I known that I might obtain pardon for A'bdullah\n\n392 No doubt the scandalous tale is meant which he had narrated concerning A'ayshah.\nby uttering more than seventy prayers, I would do so.' By these words he alluded to the blessed verse, 'Ask forgiveness for them, or do not ask. If thou ask forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah will by no means forgive them.'\n\nIn fine, the apostle of God prayed for A'bdullah, and he had not yet left the place of prayer when God the Most High revealed the verse, 'Neither do thou ever pray over any of them who shall die, neither stand at his grave,' to the end of the verse, before the corpse of A'bdullah was committed to the earth. In the Raudzatu-l-\u00e2hb\u00e2b it is recorded that after Ebn Abu Sal\u00fbl had been buried, his lordship went to the grave, ordered the body to be taken out, embraced its head, and threw some of the blessed saliva of his mouth into its mouth. The writer of these pages says that there is a difference between this tradition and another, according to which the verse 'Neither do thou pray over any of them' was revealed before the burial of A'bdullah, although the author of the Raudzatu-l-\u00e2hb\u00e2b likewise asserts it to have been revealed before the interment. It is related that when the hypocrites saw the humility manifested by Ebn Abu Sal\u00fbl on his deathbed towards his lordship, a great many of them were blessed by professing the religion. By the perusal of detailed works anyone may ascertain how the lord of apostleship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014visited Ebn Abu Sal\u00fbl, who had no equal in hypocrisy, and what had induced that prince to show him so much kindness and favour.\n\nSSIDDYQ [i.e., Abu Bakr] AND A\u2019LI THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL GO TO THE CITY OF MEKKAH.\n\nDuring this year Abu Bakr departed, by order of his lordship the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014to Mekkah, and A\u2019li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014likewise started after him. The U\u2019lam\u00e2 of biographies state that about the end of the month Dhu-l-qa\u2019dah of the ninth year after the Flight the lord of apostleship intended to go on pilgrimage; but as it\n\n393 Qur\u00e2n, ch. ix. 81. 394 Ibid., 85.\nhad reached the august hearing of his lordship that the idolaters were in the habit of circumambulating the house of Allah during the season of the pilgrimage in the same manner as in the time of ignorance, and in a state of perfect nudity, he was so disgusted that he felt disinclined to come in contact with them himself, but appointed Ssiddyq Akbar to the command of more than three hundred companions, and ordered him to go to Mekkah in order to teach the people the ceremonies of the pilgrimage and to recite to them the beginning of the Surah Ber\u00e2t, as far as forty verses. Abu Bakr accordingly donned the Ehr\u00e2m in the place Dhu-l-hayfah, and started in conformity with the orders he had received. Meanwhile, Jebr\u00e2il descended and brought to his lordship information from the Lord of Glory to the following purport: 'No one is to promulge the [Divine] message, except thyself and A\u2019li,' but according to another tradition, 'except thyself or one of thy men.' A\u2019li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014being in the whole nation and tribe the nearest relative of the apostle of God, his lordship said to him: 'Follow Abu Bakr, and take from him the commencement of the Surah Ber\u00e2t, which thou art to recite to the people at the time of the pilgrimage. Inculcate to the crowd also the following four maxims: 1. No person will enter paradise unless adorned with the decoration of the Faith. 2. No person is to encompass the Ka\u2019bah in a state of nudity. 3. After this year no professor of idolatry and aberration shall go on pilgrimage. 4. All infidels and idolaters who have made a truce with God and His prophet, shall abide thereby till the expiration of it, and after that they shall obtain a respite of four months; but if after the expiration of this second period they do not become Musalm\u00e2ns, it will be licit to take their property and to shed their blood.' J\u00e2ber B. \u2019Abdullah, the Anss\u00e2ry, who likewise went on pilgrimage with Ssiddyq, says: 'When we arrived in A\u2019rj, and the time for matutinal prayers was at hand, Abu Bakr Ssiddyq\n\n395 This word means 'Declaration of Immunity,' and is the first of ch. ix. of the Qur\u00e2n.\nwent forward to lead the devotions; but he had not yet begun them when he heard the noise made by the private camel of the lord of apostleship. He therefore stopped, and said: \"This is the voice of the she-camel of his lordship the apostle\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and possibly his lordship has been ordered to go on pilgrimage; let us wait, therefore, and pray with him.\" After a short time, however, A\u2019li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014arrived, riding on his lordship\u2019s camel, and Abu Bakr asked him: \"Hast thou arrived as commander, or commanded?\" He replied: \"I am commanded; but give me the beginning of the Surah Ber\u00e2t, because I have been ordered to read those verses to the people, and to inform them of the four maxims.\" Ssiddyq, therefore, surrendered those verses to him, and then held the prayers.' J\u00e2ber continues: 'When we arrived in Mekkah Abu Bakr one day preached a sermon before the Tarrawiah, and taught the people the ceremonies of the pilgrimage. A\u2019li got up, read the Surah Ber\u00e2t to the multitude, and rehearsed the four maxims. To each succeeding company to which Abu Bakr preached and explained the commandments, A\u2019li likewise delivered his injunctions.' It is related that when A\u2019li informed the people of the four maxims, one man exclaimed: 'If the oaths that have passed between us and thy uncle\u2019s son were to be dissolved, I swear that we would follow thee.' But A\u2019li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014replied: 'If I were not afraid to offend the apostle of God, who told me to undertake nothing till I return to him, I would certainly kill thee.' It is related that when A\u2019li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014arrived in Mekkah, he drew his sword, and said: 'I swear by God, that no one shall perform the circumambulation naked, or I shall chastise him with the sword.' Then every one who was in a state of nudity dressed himself, and those unwilling to do so abstained from circumambulating the house.\n\nIt is related that after Ssiddyq and A\u2019li had terminated their business, they returned to Madinah, and the former asked his lordship: 'What have I done that thou hast\n\n396 This is the name of the eighth day of the month Dhu-l-hejjah.\nprohibited me to read the Surah Ber\u00e2t?' He replied: 'O Abu Bakr, thou hast done nothing to incur blame. Thou hast been my companion in the cave, and thou wilt be my companion when I shall stand on the bank of the lake Kawthar; but Jebr\u00e2il had come and said: \"No one shall do it except thou, or one belonging to thee.\"'\n\nIn the Aa'l\u00e2mu-l-war\u00e2' it is related that A'li overtook Abu Bakr on the road, and that the latter asked him: 'O A'li, what has happened? Perhaps something has been revealed with reference to me?' A'li replied: 'No; but the apostle of God\u2014u. w. b.\u2014has ordered me to take from thee the Surah Ber\u00e2t, and to read it to the idolaters.'\n\nHereon Abu Bakr retraced his steps, and spoke to the apostle of God as follows: 'Verily, thou hast given me hopes that I would accomplish something whereat the people would be astonished, but thou hast revoked thy injunction when I was about to execute it. Has any [verse of the] Qur\u00e2n been revealed with reference to me?' The prophet replied: 'No; but the faithful one [i.e., Gabriel] brought me the following words from the God the Most High: \"Only thou, or a man belonging to thee, must do it.\" But A'li belongs to me; he is my brother, my legatee, my heir, and my successor in the family and among my people. When I shall be no more he will pay my debt and fulfil my promise.'\n\nThe Arrival of Wof\u00fbd [i.e., Deputations] with Laudable Intentions.\n\nIn this year, likewise, Wof\u00fbd arrived from all directions in Madinah, and were ennobled by kissing the feet of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b. Among these were also the Bani Gh\u00e2mad, who encamped near Baqyi, and hastened to the assembly of the prince of the world, leaving a young man to take care of their baggage. When they had attained the honour of kissing the carpet, and made their profession of the Faith after the customary saluta-\n\n97 'When they [were] both in the cave,' Qur\u00e2n, ch. ix. 40.\n98 In paradise.\ntions, his lordship ordered a book to be written for them, which contained the ordinances of the religion, with the principles and practice thereof. His lordship then asked those persons whether they had left anyone behind in their lodgings, and they replied: 'We have left one in our lodgings who is younger than any of us.' His lordship replied: 'He has fallen asleep; a thief has entered your lodging, and has stolen one of your travelling-bags.' One of them replied: 'No one of those persons has a travelling-bag except myself.' His lordship continued: 'The guardian of your place has again got hold of the travelling bag, and is taking care of it.' When the Wofod of the Gh\u00e2med people left the august assembly and returned to their lodgings, they asked the young watchman what had happened in their absence. He replied: 'I had fallen asleep after your departure, and a man who had been watching his opportunity stole the travelling-bag, but I jumped up from my sleep, pursued him, and found that he had entered a pit wherein he had buried the travelling-bag. Accordingly I took it out, and brought it again to our lodgings.' Those men then said to the youth: 'The apostle of God has informed us of this matter, and we bear testimony to the truth of his apostleship.' After saying these words, they again waited on the prince of existences\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and represented the fact to him, whereon the said youth was likewise ennobled by kissing the august carpet and acknowledging the unity of God the Most High and the prophetship of the lord of apostles\u2014u. w. b.\n\nAnother of the Wof\u00fbd of this year was that of Jaryr B. A\u2019bdullah Albahly, which took place as follows: A\u2019bdullah attained, with one hundred and fifty men of his tribe, the felicity of meeting his holy and prophetic lordship and of professing Isl\u00e2m. Before the arrival of that company the lord of apostleship had said to his friends: 'A man having the signs of nobility on him will make his appearance.' After his lordship had communicated this information, Jaryr B. A\u2019bdullah arrived with his people\nand made a profession of Isl\u00e1m. His lordship asked him: 'Wilt thou become my adherent, acknowledge the unity of God\u2014whose name be exalted\u2014and my apostolate? Promisest thou to hold prayers, to pay the legal alms, to keep the fast of Ramadz\u00e1n, to obey my governor, and to love all Musalm\u00e1ns, even if they were Abyssinian slaves?' Jaryr made a covenant to observe all these injunctions, and when his lordship asked him about the state of the tribes related to and dwelling near him, he replied: 'O apostle of God, the religion of Isl\u00e1m has become current among them; the people have destroyed their idol-temples, and are worshipping in mosques.' His lordship continued: 'What is the condition of the idol-temple of Dhu-l-khalyfah?' Jaryr replied: 'The idol-temple of Dhu-l-khalyfah is [standing] as before.' The apostle of God asked: 'O Jaryr, wilt thou relieve my mind of it?' Jaryr said: 'O apostle of God, it was always my wish that this business should fall to my lot, and that no one else should demolish it.' The apostle of God said: 'Go and destroy that idol-temple.' Jaryr replied: 'O apostle of God, it is very far from here to Dhu-l-khalyfah. I cannot mount a horse to reach it quickly, because every horse I ride throws me; and if I mount a camel it will take a long time to arrive there.' After Jaryr had said these words his holy and prophetic lordship exclaimed: 'O Lord, give him a guide, and cause him to be guided.' It is related of Jaryr that he said: 'When his lordship had prayed for and dismissed me I departed, and I swear by that God who has sent Muhammad in truth that I mounted an unruly, fleet charger, but I found him gentle under my thighs, like a lamb. I travelled day and night till I reached my destination, set the idol-temple on fire, and razed it to the ground. Then I despatched a courier to Madinah, to inform his lordship of what I had done.' It is related that after the burning and destruction of the idol-temple the inhabitants of Dhu-l-khalyfah attained the nobility of Isl\u00e1m. The treasury belonging to that temple contained much property and perfumes, all of which were brought to\nMadinah. When his holy and prophetic lordship heard what had taken place, and that the idol-temple had been demolished, he rejoiced greatly, invoking a benediction upon Jaryr and his tribe. It is related that the just-mentioned individual was six cubits high, so that when he sat on horseback his feet were trailing on the ground; he was also remarkably beautiful, and O'mar B. Alkhatt\u00e2b surnamed him the Yusuf [Joseph] of the [Musalm\u00e2n] people.\n\nAnother Wofod was that of the Bani Hanyfah, who alighted on their arrival in Madinah at the mansion of Ramlah, the daughter of Alh\u00e2reth, by order of the apostle of God, and thereon attained the felicity of kissing the most holy carpet and making a profession of Isl\u00e2m. Moseylamah the liar was one of that company, and likewise accepted the religion, but when he returned to Yamamah he was led astray by Satan, relapsed again, laid claim to prophecy, and said: 'The God of Muhammad has made me a partner in prophecy with Muhammad.' Thereon a great number of rebels and enemies believed him. He allowed his followers to neglect prayer, to drink wine, and to practise usury. In lieu of the glorious Qur\u00e2n he composed nonsense which was far from elegance and oratory. He despatched two of his misguided adherents as envoys to the lord of this world and the next, and sent by them an epistle, the contents whereof are, according to the tradition of the author of the Mostaqadza, as follows: 'From Moseylamah the apostle of God, to Muhammad the apostle of God. But after [the usual compliments I state]: Verily I have been made a partner with thee in this matter. One half of the earth will belong to us, and the other to the Qoraish. The nomadic Arabs will belong to thee, and those settled in towns to me; but the Qoraish are a treacherous race.'\n\nWhen the envoys of Moseylamah arrived in Madinah and presented the letter, his holy and prophetic lordship became angry, and, exhibiting the wooden toothpick he held in his hand, said: 'I swear by God that if he were to ask this from me I would not give it to him.' Then the apostle of God asked the envoys: 'What do you say?' They re-\nplied: 'We say what Moseylamah says.' His lordship continued: 'If it were not illegal to kill envoys I would slay you.' Then he ordered the following answer to be written to Moseylamah: 'From Muhammad the apostle of Allah, to Moseylamah the liar. Greeting to him who follows [Divine] guidance! Verily I have received thy letter, which attributes a falsehood and a lie to God. For He causeth those of His servants to inherit the earth whom He liketh, and the pious will have a blessed end.' It is related that when both these letters were shown to a learned Arab, he averred that the second looked like the epistle of a prophet. The author of this work says that if Divine favour seconds his intention he will soon narrate in these pages the going of Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd to Yamamah, and explain how Moseylamah the har was killed.\n\nDuring this year Firuz Daylamy, who was a son of the Najj\u00e2shy's daughter, became a Musalm\u00e2n. This Firuz is the same who killed Aswad B. I'sa, who claimed to be a prophet; but as many of the chief historians state that Aswad was slain during the Khalifate of Ssiddyq Akbar\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and not during the life-time of the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014that event will be narrated with those that took place during the reign of the just-mentioned Khalif, if it pleaseth Allah the Most High. In this year B\u00e2d\u00e2n, the Governor of Yemen, whose profession of Islam has been recorded above, departed from this perishable to the imperishable abode, and his lordship having been informed of this event, he made the following distribution: To the son of B\u00e2d\u00e2n he assigned a portion of the province, another to A'amer B. Shamm\u00e2r Hamd\u00e2ny, another to Abu M\u00fbsa Asha'ry, another to Ali B. Ommyah, and another to Ma'adh B. Jabul.\n\nA'li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014proceeds to Yemen, and the Deeds of that Em\u00e2m of the Age.\n\nDuring this year the Mussttafa\u2014u. w. b.\u2014appointed Ali Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014to go to Yemen, and ordered him to encamp in the place Qub\u00e2, so that those destined to serve\nunder his command might join him. He tied a standard for the Commander of the Faithful with his own prosperous hands and fixed two streamers on the top thereof; one being in front, about a cubit long, and the other in the rear, one span in length. He attached three hundred brave men to the Commander, saying: 'O A'li, I send thee away, and am sorry to part with thee!' and continued: 'O A'li, invade the country of the enemies, but fight them not, until they attack thee. Invite them to utter the words \"There is no God but Allah.\" If they accept them, teach them to pray, and to give alms to the poor among them; and if they assent, injure them in no way whatever.' It is related that when A'li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014was about to depart to Yemen, he said: 'O apostle of God, thou sendest me to the country of people who have received a book [i.e., Jews and Christians]; but I am young, and not very well acquainted with the judicial commandments and ordinances of our religion.' Then his lordship placed his august hand on the breast of A'li, and said: 'O God, strengthen his tongue and create a new heart in him!' Wherefore he became so accomplished in judicial matters that his lordship said: 'The most skilled among us in religious law is A'li.' There is a tradition that when the apostle of God\u2014u. w. b.\u2014took leave of A'li, he said: 'By Allah! if God the Most High bestows guidance on a single individual by means of thee, thou wilt fare better than anyone that the sun ever rose or shone upon.' In fine, A'li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014marched with three hundred valiant men to Yemen, and when the glorious army had reached its destination, it obtained much plunder. It is related of Bar\u00e2 B. Gh\u00e2reb that he said: 'When we arrived in the vicinity of Yemen, we discovered traces of the army of the opponents, and when A'li Murtadza had completed his prayers, he drew up the army in battle-array, entered the plain, and read to the inhabitants the letter of the apostle of God, inviting them to accept the orthodox religion; and among the inhabitants of Yemen the tribe Hamd\u00e2n at once attained the nobility of Isl\u00e2m. A'li then\nwrote a letter to his lordship the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014wherein he explained what had taken place, and that prince was so rejoiced by the news that he performed the prostration of gratitude. In some books we read that when the victorious army of the Commander of the Faithful was roaming about in all directions collecting plunder, A'li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014appointed Borydah B. Alhassyb to guard the spoils, and marched against the opponents, whom he encountered, and invited to accept the religion. They, however, refused to comply, stretching out their hands for arrows and stones. The Commander therefore halted awhile, and afterwards again invited them by wise arguments and counsel to accept the way of truth, but in vain. Perceiving that nought remained but to fight them, he drew up his forces in battle-array and handed the flag to Masud B. Sanan Solmy. While both parties were thus engaged in getting ready, a man of the Madhaj tribe, Madan by name, entered the lists from the side of the enemy, but Aswad Khozaa'y rushed upon him like a furious lion and sent him to the fire of hell with one blow of his scimitar. After that A'li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014u w. b.\u2014entered the battle-field, and when twenty idolaters had been slain, the rest whom the sword had spared took to flight. His lordship the Commander of the Faithful then advanced further, invited those people to accept Isl\u00e2m, whereon they became Musalmans, and said: 'If thou orderest us to attack those who have not adopted Isl\u00e2m, nor intend to do so, we shall obey thee. Our property is at thy disposal. Take from it the portion due to God, that we may be absolved from further disbursements.' He complied with their request, distributed the spoils, separated one-fifth thereof, and appointed Abu Rafi' to guard it. Then he proceeded on the wings of celerity to Mekkah, because his holy and prophetic lordship had departed to the sanctuary, as will be narrated by-and-by.\n\nBiographical works are replete with accounts that before A'li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had started, the apostle of God sent Kh\u00e2led B. Wolyd to Yemen, and that afterwards he\ndespatched the former to supervise the latter. Some allege that he had despatched A\u2019li merely to receive one-fifth of the spoils which Kh\u00e2led had collected. There is a tradition of Borydah B. Alhassyb that he said: \u2018I was present in that expedition, and was an enemy to A\u2019li. When one-fifth of the booty had been separated, A\u2019li picked out for himself a maiden, distinguished above all the others in beauty and amiability, associated with her, and then washed himself. After that I asked Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd: \u201cSeest thou what that man A\u2019li is doing?\u201d I also said to A\u2019li: \u201cO father of Hasan, what is this?\u201d He replied: \u201cSeest thou not that this girl, which was in the fifth part of the spoils, and fell to the share of the family of Muhammad, became afterwards the portion of the family of A\u2019li, and I had intercourse with her.\u201d\u2019 Borydah continues: \u2018When I attained the happiness of waiting on the prince of existences\u2014u. w. b.\u2014I represented what had taken place, and he replied: \u201cO Borydah, perhaps thou art an enemy of A\u2019li?\u201d I said: \u201cYes.\u201d He continued: \u201cBe not his enemy; for if thou wilt like him, thy friendship will increase. The portion of A\u2019li in the fifth amounted to more than this girl.\u201d\u2019 Others, again, have a tradition that Borydah said: \u2018When I represented the circumstance to the apostle of God, his blessed countenance became excited, and he said: \u201cHarbour no evil suspicions about A\u2019li, for he belongs to me, and I to him. He is your master; and when I am dead, A\u2019li will be the master of every one whose master I am.\u201d\u2019 Borydah continues: \u2018After that I loved A\u2019li more than anyone else.\u2019\n\nIn some books it is related that after the Ghazwah of Tabuk, A\u2019mru B. Ma\u2019dy Karibu-z-zobaydy came to Madinah, and presented himself in the assembly of his lordship the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014who spoke to him something about the day of the resurrection, in consequence whereof he became a Musalm\u00e2n, and many of his people followed his example. On that occasion A\u2019mru discovered Abu Sha\u2019th Alkhosha\u2019y, the murderer of his father, whom he caught by the neck and brought to his\nholy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014to revenge himself on him by the command of that prince; but the apostle of God said: \u2018Isl\u0101m abrogates every custom which existed in the time of ignorance.\u2019 This reply so displeased A\u2019mru B. Ma\u2019dy that he apostatized and returned to his own country; on the road, however, he plundered a company of the Bani Alh\u00e2reth B. Ka\u2019b and then joined his tribe. When the prince of existences had heard this news, he despatched A\u2019li B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb\u2014u. w. b.\u2014with a number of Moh\u00e2jer against the Bani Zobayd, who were of the people of A\u2019mru. At the same time he despatched Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd against a certain Arab tribe, with orders that when the cavalry of A\u2019li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and of Kh\u00e2led joined each other, the former should be the commander of both. In fine, A\u2019li Murtadza appointed Kh\u00e2led B. Sa\u2019yd Ala\u2019ass, and Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd appointed Abu M\u00fbsa Asha\u2019ry, to command the vanguard of their respective forces, both of which thereon separated, and marched to their destinations. The troops that were with Kh\u00e2led likewise separated into two parties, one of them marching to Yemen, and the other joining the Bani Zobayd. When A\u2019li the Amir of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014learnt what had taken place, he sent a messenger to Kh\u00e2led B. Wolyd with the following order: \u2018Thou art to stop at the place in which my courier meets thee.\u2019 Kh\u00e2led, however, paying no attention to this order, A\u2019li the Commander of the Faithful ordered Kh\u00e2led B. Sa\u2019yd to overtake Kh\u00e2led B. Alwolyd, and to stop him, wherever he might find him, until the Amir reached him. Kh\u00e2led B. Sa\u2019yd obeyed, and when the Amir reached the cavalry of Kh\u00e2led B. Wolyd he sharply reproved him for his disobedience, and then marched against the tribe of A\u2019mru B. Ma\u2019dy Karab, to whom his people said: \u2018O father of Th\u00fbr, what thinkest thou of the Qoraish youth who is coming to levy duties and taxes from thee?\u2019 A\u2019mru replied: \u2018He will learn that in any place he meets me.\u2019 When the two opposing parties encountered each other, A\u2019mru B. Ma\u2019dy stepped into the battle-field and shouted for a champion, whereon the Com-\nmander of the Faithful got ready to fight him, but Kh\u00e2led B. Sa\u2019yd exclaimed: \u2018O father of Hasan, may my father and mother be a sacrifice for thee! wilt thou allow me to punish A\u2019mru?\u2019 The Amir, however, replied: \u2018If thou considerest it thy duty to obey me, thou wilt remain quiet in thy place, so that I may fight him.\u2019 Kh\u00e2led accordingly obeyed, and the Commander, arriving opposite to A\u2019mru, uttered a shout so loud as to frighten A\u2019mru that he fled, whereon the victorious army attacked the opponents, killing the brother and nephew of A\u2019mru, as well as capturing his wife, with several other women. After the most noble mind of the Commander of the Faithful had been set at rest with reference to the enemies, he returned, but left Kh\u00e2led B. Sa\u2019yd in the locality to collect the legal alms, and ordered him to spare the life of every fugitive returning and becoming a Musalm\u00e2n.\n\nAfter the departure of A\u2019li B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb\u2014u. w. b.\u2014A\u2019mru B. Ma\u2019dy Karab went to Kh\u00e2led B. Sa\u2019yd and became a Musalm\u00e2n [again]; he also requested the latter to liberate his family from bondage, which was done. After A\u2019li the Commander of the Faithful had gained the victory in that expedition, he selected a maiden for his own use from the fifth part of the spoils, but as soon as Kh\u00e2led B. Wolyd had heard of this, he forthwith despatched Borydah to inform the apostle of Allah\u2014u. w. b.\u2014of what A\u2019li had done. Borydah obeyed, and handed Kh\u00e2led\u2019s letter containing the accusation against A\u2019li to the lord of prophecy, who became excited on learning what had taken place, and his blessed countenance glowed with anger, whereon Borydah said: \u2018O apostle of God, if thou allowest people to commit such transgressions, the efforts of the Musalm\u00e2ns will be rendered nugatory.\u2019 His holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014however, replied: \u2018Woe betide thee, Borydah! thou hast committed hypocrisy with reference to A\u2019li. Verily A\u2019li B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb is allowed to take from the spoils whatever I am allowed to take. A\u2019li B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb is the best of men. For thee and for thy tribe he will be the best man to succeed after me, as well as for the whole\nnation. O Borydah, take care not to be the enemy of A'li; for God the Most High will be thy enemy.' Borydah says: 'On that occasion I wished the earth would open and swallow me, and I exclaimed: \"May Allah protect me from the wrath of the apostle of God! O apostle of Allah, implore pardon for me; for after this I shall never harbour enmity against Ali, nor speak evil of him.\" Then the apostle of God prayed that I might be forgiven.' Borydah says: 'After that I loved A'li more than anyone else.' The author of the book *Aa'lamu-l-war\u00e2* says that Ebn Hanbal has narrated this story in his *Masnad*.\n\n**Ka\u2019bu-l-akhb\u00e2r makes his Profession of Isl\u00e2m by the Blessing of the Words of the Lion of Attack\u2014U. W. B.**\n\nThere is a tradition that when A'li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014to whom salutation\u2014sojourned in the country of Yemen, preached, and taught the ordinances of Islam, and Ka\u2019bu-l-akhb\u00e2r had been informed of his eloquence, he donned a robe, mounted a camel, and proceeded in company of one of the U\u2019lam\u00e2 of the Jews, who was his co-religionist, to the assembly of the Amir, who, at the time they entered, happened to be preaching and uttering the words, 'There are men who can see in the night, but not in the day,' and Ka\u2019bu-l-akhb\u00e2r said: 'He speaks the truth.' Afterwards the illustrious Commander said: 'Whoever gives with a short hand will be requited with a long hand.' Ka'b again manifested his approbation, but his Jewish companion asked him how he could approve of sentiments the meaning whereof is ambiguous? Ka'b, however, replied: 'The man who sees in the night, but not in the day, is he who believes in the first book [i.e., the Pentateuch] but not in the last [i.e., the Qur\u00e2n]. He who sees neither in the night nor in the day is a man who believes in neither; and the other assertion is [likewise] plain, because with God the Most High and Glorious alms are acceptable, and He returns them abundantly.' Meanwhile a mendicant begged something from Ka'b, who immediately divested himself of his cloak and surrendered it to him.\nThe Jewish priest was so displeased with this act that he immediately left Ka'b, and returned to his home. After his departure a woman approached Ka'b, and said: 'Who will give me his camel, and will take mine instead?' Ka'b replied: 'If thou wilt give me thy cloak in addition to it, I shall agree to the exchange.' The woman having assented, Ka'b donned her cloak, mounted the camel, went after the priest, and when he had reached him, said: 'Who gives with a short hand is requited with a long hand.' Then Ka'b again returned, waited on the Amir, and inquired about his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b. A'li complied with his request, beginning to enumerate the qualities of his lordship, but Kh\u00e2led smiled, and when A'li the Commander of the Faithful asked him for the reason, he replied: 'I smile because in ancient books we find the qualities of Muhammad to agree with those thou art describing.' Then Ka'bu-l-akhb\u00e2r made his profession of the Faith, and learnt the ordinances of Isl\u00e2m from A'li the Commander of the Faithful according to the best of his ability, remained in Yemen, made it his business to propagate the doctrines and tenets of the noble religion, but came to Madinah during the Khalifate of O'mar the Commander of the Faithful, and always regretted having failed to wait on his lordship the best of created beings. It is, however, related in the history of Ebn Hamdan that at the time when O'mar Alkhatt\u00e2b marched to Ayly\u00e2, K'abu-l-akhb\u00e2r was dwelling in Syria, and that when the victorious banners of that Khalifah occupied the country, Ka'bu-l-akhbar made haste to wait on him, and to make his profession of the Faith; but Allah the Most High knoweth best.\n\nRevelation of the Blessed Verse of 'Imprecation,' and the Arrival of the Inhabitants of Najr\u00e2n for the Purpose of a Treaty of Amity.\n\nDuring this year peace was concluded between his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and between the Christians of Najr\u00e2n, which happened as follows: The apostle of God had written a letter to the Christians of Najr\u00e2n,\nand had invited them to make a profession of Isl\u0101m. They consulted with each other, selected fourteen men from among themselves, and despatched them to Madinah to obtain authentic information about the prince of existences, and to communicate the same to them. In this Wofod [deputation] there were three distinguished individuals, one of whom was A'bdu-l-masyh [servant of the Messiah], surnamed A'aqubat; he was the Amir, the adviser, and the governor of the Christians of Najr\u0101n. The second was a man who had numerous retainers and great property; his name was Yahun, and his surname Sayid. The third was Abu-l-h\u00e2reth B. A'lqomah, a scholar and teacher enjoying high dignity and great respect among the Christians. The Greek kings had built churches for him, and paid him a stipend. Abu-l-h\u00e2reth had a brother, named Karaz B. A'lqomah, who was also one of the fourteen. While travelling the mule of Abu-l-h\u00e2reth excelled [the others], and Karaz said: 'Let him excel who is farthest, namely, Muhammad.' Abu-l-h\u00e2reth replied: 'Excel thou rather.' Karaz asked: 'Why sayest thou so, O brother?' Abu-l-h\u00e2reth rejoined: 'I swear by Allah that Muhammad is the apostle of God, whom we were expecting.' Karaz asked: 'If such be the case, why makest thou not a profession of the religion of Muhammad? And what hindereth thee from following him?' Abu-l-h\u00e2reth replied: 'To agree with Muhammad would entail the enmity of our people; for if we were to do such a thing, we would no longer be respected by the Christians, who would take away all the gifts and possessions which they have given us.' These words engendered love for Isl\u0101m in the heart of Karaz; he impelled his camel quickly, and made his profession of Isl\u0101m as soon as he attained the felicity of the hand-kiss.\n\nIt is related that when the inhabitants of Najr\u0101n came to Madinah they wore gold rings on their fingers, and laid aside their travelling apparel, in lieu whereof they donned silk garments, and, trailing their skirts on the ground, thus entered the mosque of the apostle of God, and saluted him.\nThat prince, however, would not return their greeting nor look at the Christians. They therefore, following the custom of their religion, turned their faces eastward and engaged in prayers; nor did any person present interrupt them, by order of his holy and prophetic lordship. When they had terminated their devotions they approached the apostle, but received no answer to all their speeches. They therefore departed from the mosque sad and disappointed, going to seek an interview with O'thman B. O'ff\u00e2n and A'bdu-r-rahman B. A'wuf, with whom they had previously been acquainted. They explained their case to them, and said: 'What are we to do now? Must we return to our country, or wait a couple of days?' Then O'thman and A'bdu-r-rahman asked A'li the Commander of the Faithful, who had been present during this interview: 'O father of Hasan, what is thy opinion concerning these men?' He replied: 'They must put away their gold rings from their fingers, and exchange their garments for the clothes they wore on their journey.' Or, according to another tradition: 'They must put on their costume of monks, and thus enter the august assembly.' The Christians accordingly followed the directions of A'li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014waited on the prince of apostles, and saluted him, whereon his lordship opened his blessed mouth in reply to them, and said: 'I swear by that God who has sent me in reality to mankind, that when these men first entered they arrived in the company of Satan.' His lordship then honoured them with compliments, and invited them to make their profession of Isl\u00e1m; but the Christians refused, and uttered unconnected words. On that occasion their bishop asked: 'O Muhammad, what thinkest thou of our Lord the Messiah?' That prince replied: 'He was a servant of God and a prophet.' The bishop continued: 'Thinkest thou that I'sa\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had a father who begat him?' His lordship said: 'No.' The bishop asked: 'Then how sayest thou that he was a servant and a created being, whereas thou canst not see any created being without a father?' But his lordship said: 'This day I shall not reply\nto your questions. Remain in this city until you receive the answer to your inquiry.'\n\nThe next day the following verse was revealed: 'Verily the likeness of Jesus in the sight of Allah is as the likeness of Adam. He created him out of dust, and then said unto him, Be, and he was. [This is] the truth from thy Lord; be not therefore [one] of those who doubt; and whoever shall dispute with thee concerning him after the knowledge which hath been given thee, say [unto them], Come, let us call together our sons, and your sons, and our wives, and your wives, and ourselves, and yourselves; then let us make imprecations,'\\(^{390}\\) and lay the curse of Allah on those who lie.' Then his lordship the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014called the men of Najr\u00e2n, and recited to them the verse which had just been revealed. They, however, remained steadfast in their belief, denying the truth of the Qur\u00e2\u0144, and when his lordship perceived the obstinacy and resistance of the Christians, he said to them: 'Come, let us make imprecations, and lay the curse of Allah on those who lie.' The Christians, however, replied: 'Give us respite this day, that we may go and consider, and make our imprecations to-morrow.' His lordship complied with their request, the Christians returned to their lodgings, and said to A'aqubat, who was their adviser and counsellor: 'What do circumstances require and what must we do? We shall act according to what seems best to thee.' A'aqubat replied: 'O ye Christian people, you know full well as a certainty that Muhammad is an inspired prophet, and that he has given you a convincing argument about I'sa\u2014u. w. b. Leave off, therefore, making imprecations. By Allah, no sect had ever made [mutual] imprecations with a prophet, and lived after that; and if you make imprecations with him, you will all perish. As, however, you do not mean to abandon your religion, enter into negotiations with him, and get him to agree to your being allowed to pay the poll-tax.' After they had all assented to this\n\n\\(^{390}\\) On account of this word this passage is called the verse of imprecation. See Qur\u00e2\u0144, ch. iii. 52, 53, 54.\n\nVOL. II.\nproposal, the Wofod proceeded next morning to the sacred habitation, at the moment when his lordship the refuge of termination was just coming out from his august chamber, leading Hasan, the son of A\u2019li B. Abu Tt\u00e1leb\u2014u. w. b.\u2014by the hand, with that of Husayn, the [other] son of A\u2019li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014under his arm, followed by A\u2019li and Fattimah\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and saying to them: \u2018When I finish the prayers you must say Amen.\u2019 After the Christians had seen these five persons, heard the prayers and the Amen, they were overwhelmed with fear and terror. Hereon Abu-l-h\u00e1reth, who was their scholar and spokesman, said: \u2018My friends, I behold a man who is able to move a mountain from its place if he willeth. You must, therefore, not make imprecations with him, or else you will bring on your own destruction. I believe that if you dispute with him, not a single Christian will be left alive in the world.\u2019 After they had considered the matter for a while, they said to the apostle of God: \u2018We shall not make imprecations with thee.\u2019 Hereon that prince invited them to accept Isl\u00e2m, and when they refused, he said: \u2018Then prepare for war and bloodshed.\u2019 They replied: \u2018We have not the strength to resist the Arabs, but we promise to pay thee every year two thousand garments; in the month Ssafar one thousand, and in the month Rajab one thousand, the price of every garment being forty dirhems; on condition that we be allowed to retain our religion and to live under thy protection.\u2019 His lordship agreed to these conditions, and having written a treaty of peace, handed it to the Christians.\n\nIn some books we read that when the verse of \u2018imprecation\u2019 was revealed the Christians consulted with each other about returning next day and making imprecations. When, however, they had left the august assembly and had returned to their lodgings, the bishop said to them: \u2018If Muhammad causes his family and children to be present at the imprecation, you must abstain therefrom, because it would bring calamity on the Christians; but if he brings only his friends with him, you may hold the imprecation.\u2019\nWhen the apostle of God came out in the morning from his chamber, leading Hasan and Husayn, the sons of A\u2019li, followed by the latter with Fattimah, A\u2019aqubat, and Sayd, and Abu-l-h\u00e2reth, who were the chiefs of the Christians, made their appearance. The bishop asked: \u2018Who are these persons accompanying Muhammad?\u2019 Being told that they were A\u2019li, his cousin and son-in-law, with his wife, the mother of these two children, all the most excellent and noble of mankind, the bishop continued: \u2018I swear by God, in the grasp of whose power my life is, that I see persons whose request God would grant if they were to pray for the removal of a mountain. Make no impreca\u00actions with Muhammad, for he has come with his family and is trusting in God. If you make impreca\u00actions against him your times will be changed, your country will be abased, and no Christian will be left on the face of the earth. Were it not for fear of the Qayssar, I would be the first to profess Isl\u00e2m. You must make a treaty of peace with Muhammad, and agree to what both parties might decide upon.\u2019 When the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014arrived near that company he sat down on his haunches and invited them to make impreca\u00actions.\u2019 The bishop, however, said: \u2018I swear by God, he is on his knees as prophets are accustomed to sit during impreca\u00actions, and the truth is on his side.\u2019 The Christians, who had heard these words of their bishop, said: \u2018O father of Q\u00e2sim, we shall not utter impreca\u00actions against, but will make peace with thee.\u2019 Thereon the treaty was concluded between the two parties as recorded above, and when the negotiation had come to an end, the lord of apostleship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014said to the bishop: \u2018I see thee returning to thy quarters, falling asleep, and afterwards placing the bridle on thy camel, putting that before which ought to be behind.\u2019 When the bishop went to his dwelling he slept. Then he rose, carelessly placed the reins in the wrong way on his camel, but, perceiving his mistake, he exclaimed: \u2018I testify that there is no God but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is the apostle of Allah.\u2019 It is related that on the above occasion\nthe apostle of God said with his wonderfully eloquent tongue: 'I swear by Allah, in whose power my life is, that misfortune would have befallen the people of Najr\u00e2n had they made imprecations against me, because God the Most High would have changed them into monkeys and hogs. Fire would have rained upon them from this W\u00e2dy, and God the Most High would have extirpated the inhabitants of Najr\u00e2n before the expiration of one year. In the Kasha-fu-l-ghummah there is a tradition of A'ayshah that she said: 'The apostle of God came out in a cloak of black fur, and after him Hasan, whom he put into it; then came Husayn, whom he likewise placed under it. Then A'li said: \"Verily God desires to remove sinfulness from you, and to purify you with a perfect purification.\"'\n\nHAJJATU-L-WODAA' [PILGRIMAGE OF VALEDICTION].\n\nDuring the year his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014went on pilgrimage, which took place as follows: After the apostle of God had determined to go to Mekkah, he sent messengers to the Arab tribes who had attained the nobility of Isl\u00e2m that he was about to proceed to the sanctuary, and that all persons desirous to go on pilgrimage were to leave their habitations and to join him. When this news had spread far and wide, numbers of people beyond all calculation started for Mekkah, and were in attendance on the heaven-aspiring stirrup to learn the ceremonies of the visitation. When the crowds had assembled his lordship started, according to one tradition, on Sunday, the twenty-fifth of the month Dhu-l-qa\u2019dah, and according to another he departed on Monday from Madinah; but another tradition states that he performed his ablution on the first day of the said month, anointed his blessed countenance with oil, combed his propitious head, perfumed his unparalleled body, laid aside his garments, donned himself in two Iz\u00e2rs, issued from his august apartment, held\n\n400 This Christian deputation from Najr\u00e2n is also discussed in Sir William Muir's 'Life of Mahomet,' vol. ii., pp. 300-303.\nthe ordained prayers with four flexions at noon in the mosque of Madinah, and departed to Dhu-l-khalifah. When he arrived in that place he held the omitted post-meridian prayers, and selected nearly one hundred camels for the sacrifice. One of these he himself consecrated, and put on the garlands with his own blessed hands, appointing Nahyah B. Jundal to take care of the others. Nahyah says: 'I asked his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014what I was to do in case a camel should be in danger of perishing. And he replied: \"Slaughter it, and having sprinkled its garland with blood, place its trappings on Yemen-cloth, but neither thou nor thy companions must eat of the flesh thereof.\"\n\nOn that occasion Fattimah\u2014salutation to her\u2014and all the other mothers of the Musalmans were seated in howdahs, and had the felicity of accompanying the prophet. According to a certain tradition, one hundred and fourteen thousand persons were in that journey attending on the heaven-aspiring stirrup, and after his lordship had held the second prayers at Dhu-l-khalifah, he mounted his private camel Qasswy and tied on the Ehr\u00e1m. J\u00e2ber the Anss\u00e2ry says: 'When I arrived in the retinue of the apostle of God at Dhu-l-khalifah, Asm\u00e2, the daughter of O'mys, gave birth to Muhammad B. Abu Bakr, and sent to his lordship a message asking him what she was to do with the breathings?' He sent the reply: \"Tie up thy womb with something, but do not disregard thy Ehr\u00e1m [state of a pilgrim], and utter the Talabbyah.\" The Talabbyah is comprised in the following words: \"I await Thy commands, O Allah! I await Thy commands! Thou hast no partner! I await Thy commands! For praise and glory are due to Thee! Thou hast no partner!\"\n\nAfter travelling over the distance he arrived in Dhu Towa, where he held the matutinal prayers, and leaving that place, he entered Mekkah from the upper portion, proceeded to the mosque of the sanctuary, saluted the blackstone, and encompassed the house [of the Ka'bah], proceed-\n\n401 This is the name of the hemorrhage after parturition.\ning quickly during the three first, and according to the usual manner during the four last circumambulations, i.e., slowly. On that occasion he drew forth his sacred Red\u00e2 from under his right arm, and threw it over his left shoulder. After the circumambulation he turned his propitious face to the place of Ebr\u00e2him, and recited the blessed verse, 'Consider the place of Ebr\u00e2him as a place of prayer,' with his wonderfully eloquent tongue. Between the Ka\u2019bah and the place of Ebr\u00e2him he prayed with two flexions, during the first of which he recited the F\u00e2tehah [first chapter of the Qur\u00e2n] and 'Say, O ye unbelievers.' During the second he recited the S\u00fbrah Ikhl\u00e2ss, proceeded to the black-stone, touched it, and came out by the gate of Ssaf\u00e2. When he arrived in the last-mentioned place he recited the blessed verse, 'Moreover, Ssaf\u00e2 and Merwah are [two] of the monuments of Allah,' and said: 'I begin wherewith Allah the Most High has begun,' and ran between Ssaf\u00e2 and Merwah. When he entered Ssaf\u00e2, he turned his blessed face to the Qiblah of prayer, looked towards the house of the Ka\u2019bah, and said: 'There is no God but Allah alone. He has no partner. To Him belong the kingdom and the glory. He causes people to live and to die, and He is the living One who dies not. He is omnipotent. There is no God but Allah alone. He kept His promise, aided His servants, and He alone put the confederates to flight.' Then he prayed, and thrice repeated the just-mentioned words. After that he proceeded to Merwah, went quickly through the W\u00e2dy, and then again went slowly, acting in Merwah as he had done in Ssaf\u00e2. When he had finished running, he issued orders that everyone who had no [animal for] sacrifice should divest himself of the Ehr\u00e2m and be free, but put it on again on the day of Tarawiah; but that anyone possessing an animal for sacrifice should abide in his Ehr\u00e2m till the day of the slaughter. Then he said: 'Had I known before what I know now, I would not have brought any sacrificial animals with me, but would have.\n\n402 Qur\u00e2n, ch. cix.\n403 Qur\u00e2n, ch. cxii., 'Declaration of God\u2019s unity.'\n404 Ibid., ch. ii., part of verse 153.\npurchased them in Mekkah, would have laid aside my Ehr\u00e2m, and at present be free like yourselves; but as I have the animals with me, I cannot be delivered [of the Ehr\u00e2m] until I have slaughtered them.' Fattimah Zohr\u00e2\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and several other mothers of the Musalm\u00e2ns having no sacrificial camels with them, they were freed of the Ehr\u00e2m, as also the companions who had no animals to sacrifice. Meanwhile also A'li the Commander of the Faithful had arrived from Yemen, bringing several camels for presentation to his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and that prince asked him: 'With what intention hast thou tied on the Ehr\u00e2m?' He replied: 'O apostle of God, as thou hast not told me thy intention, I said: \"O Allah, I have tied on the Ehr\u00e2m with the same intention wherewith Thy apostle has tied it on.\" ' The prophet replied: 'I have tied on the Ehr\u00e2m for the pilgrimage, and have brought with me sacrificial camels. Abide thou also in thy Ehr\u00e2m, and be my partner in the presentation-camels.' On that occasion A'li Murtadza\u2014u. w. b.\u2014saw that Fattimah\u2014u. w. b.\u2014was dressed in a handsome robe, and had collyrium round her eyes. He therefore asked why she had freed herself [from the obligations of the Ehr\u00e2m], but the princess of the women of this world\u2014u. w. b.\u2014replied: 'I have put away the Ehr\u00e2m by order of the prophet.'\n\nThe apostle of God\u2014u. w. b.\u2014remained from Sunday till Thursday, the eighth of Dhu-l-hejjah, i.e., four days, and went on the said Thursday with the Musalm\u00e2ns to Menah, where he rested, holding the daily prayers as well as the vespertine and dormitory ones. He spent also the night in that locality, and held the matutinal prayers in the morning, and went after sunrise to A'rafat, where he entered a tent prepared for him in the place called U'rwa. There he remained till the sun began to decline, whereon he mounted his she-camel Qasswy and entered the lower portion of the W\u00e2dy, where he preached a sermon mounted as he was, and said during it: 'Ye are prohibited to shed each other's blood, to take each other's property, or to quarrel during\nthis sacred day and month.' He also said: 'Be aware that I have trodden under foot the customs of the time of ignorance, and any murders committed during it can now no longer be avenged. The first retaliation which I have ordered to be abrogated was the one for the murder of Rabya'h B. Alh\u00e2reth B. A'bd-ul-Muttalleb, the son of my father's brother. I have abolished the blood-mulet of the time of ignorance, and the first which I thus abrogate is that for A'bb\u00e2s B. A'bd-ul-Muttalleb, that I may be the first who shows how to abstain from taking blood or property [in retaliation].' After that he uttered with his wonderfully eloquent tongue several precepts about keeping women, and continued: 'I leave something with you, which if you follow it you will not err, namely, the Qur\u00e2n.' He also said: 'You shall be questioned about me on the morrow of the resurrection. You will be asked, \"How has Muhammad dealt with you? How has he promulged his message and the commandments?\" What reply will you give?' They answered: 'On that day we shall bear witness that thou hast fulfilled the conditions of thy apostleship, hast discharged the duties wherewith thou hast been entrusted, and hast not omitted to promulge any of the laws of direction, nor the needful admonitions.' When that prince heard these words he lifted his index-finger to heaven, and then, pointing to the ground, he exclaimed thrice: 'O Allah, I bear testimony [to what the people have now said].' After that the call to prayers and the Eq\u00e2met\\(^{405}\\) were proclaimed. He led the devotions, the Eq\u00e2met was repeated, and he again held prayers with the assembled multitude. After that he mounted his camel, entered the Maqaf,\\(^{406}\\) turned his face to the Qiblah, engaged in devotions, and continued them till sunset.\n\nEbn A'bb\u00e2s says: 'When the apostle of God stood in the Maqaf, I saw him raising his blessed hands and touching his propitious countenance with his palms, saying: \"The most excellent prayer of mine, and of the prophets who\n\n\\(^{405}\\) Call to prayers besides the appointed times.\n\\(^{406}\\) Name of the standing place in A'rafat.\nwere before me, is this: \"There is no God but Allah alone, who has no partner. His is the kingdom and the glory, and He is omnipotent.\" In some biographical works it is mentioned that there is a difference of opinion among the U'lam\u00e2 whether that prince was fasting on the day of A'rafat or not. The argument of those who believe that he did not fast is that Ommu-l-fadzl, the mother of A'bdullah B. A'bb\u00e2s, had said: 'At the time when his lordship was standing in the Maqaf I sent him a pitcher of milk, of which he drank, and the people who saw it knew that he was not fasting.' On this day, also, the blessed verse, 'To-day I have perfected your religion, and have completed my favour to you, and have granted you Isl\u00e2m for a religion,'\\(^{407}\\) was revealed. It is related that on the said day he remained till sunset in A'rafat. Then he caused As\u00e2mah B. Zayd to mount behind him, and held the bridle of Qasswy so short that the camel's head touched the pillow which was in front of his lordship; but when she began to ascend he slackened the reins, so that the camel went up easily. When he arrived at Mazdalfah he held the sunset and evening prayers, with the Adh\u00e2n\\(^{408}\\) and Eq\u00e2met, spending the night in Mazdalfah. In the morning, when it was yet dark, he held prayers, went to the holy monument,\\(^{409}\\) stood with his face towards the Qiblah, uttering the Takbyr, the Tahlyl,\\(^{410}\\) and the Taw\u00e2hyd,\\(^{411}\\) and remaining until the day had fairly dawned. He left the holy monument before the sun rose, and after it had risen the Qoraish also departed. When his lordship went away he allowed Fadzl B. A'bb\u00e2s, who was a son of Ssabyh Alwojah, to mount behind him; but as they were riding Fadzl looked every now and then towards the women of Bahrayin, who were just passing, and that prince with his blessed hand turned the head of the young man away from them in another direction. When they arrived in the valley of the\n\n\\(^{407}\\) Qur\u00e2n, ch. v. 5.\n\n\\(^{408}\\) Call to prayers by the Muedhdhin.\n\n\\(^{409}\\) Qur\u00e2n, ch. ii. 194. Almasha'ri-l-hor\u00e2m.\n\n\\(^{410}\\) This is merely the joyous shout, 'Allah! Allah!'\n\n\\(^{411}\\) This is La alaha illallah: 'There is no God but Allah!'\nceremonies he impelled his camel quickly, and proceeded through the middle road to Hamratu-l-a'qabah Kabra. When he reached the last-named place he halted in the centre of the W\u00e2dy, where he threw seven stones, and shouted the Takbyr at the throwing of each. On this day he preached at Men\u00e2, prohibiting bloodshed, rapacity, and quarrelling in the same way as he had done on the day of A'rafat. He also described the coming of the Dujj\u00e2l,\\textsuperscript{412} his figure, and qualities. He also imparted advice on many other subjects. When he had terminated his sermon he hastened to the Manahar,\\textsuperscript{413} where the sacrificial camels of the apostle of God had been kept; together with those brought by A'li from Yemen, which amounted to nearly one hundred. Of these he killed sixty-three with his own hands, according to the number of the years of his age, and ordered A'li to slaughter the rest. Then he got his blessed head shaved, and distributed the sacred hairs thereof among his companions and wives. Some of the companions likewise shaved, whilst others merely clipped their hair. For the former his lordship uttered three prayers, and for the latter one prayer, in the same way as on the day of Hodaybiah, for mercy and pardon. He ordered also a little flesh to be taken from every one of the camels sacrificed, and to be cooked in a pot. The noble one of the family of B. Gh\u00e2leb\u2014u. w. b.\u2014\\textsuperscript{414} partook of that meat and broth with A'li B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb, because he had made him his partner and associate in the sacrifice. After that A'li the Commander of the Faithful distributed, by order of his lordship, the meat and hides of the camels among the people, and paid the wages of the butchers from other sources. When he was freed from [the restrictions and ceremonies of] the Ehr\u00e2m, he rode to Mekkah, encompassed the Ka'bah, held the earlier prayers, went to the well Zemzem, and said: 'O sons of A'bd-ul-Muttalleb, draw water from the well Zemzem; and if I feared not that\n\n\\textsuperscript{412} The Antichrist.\n\\textsuperscript{413} Name of the place where the sacrificial animals are slaughtered.\n\\textsuperscript{414} This is also an epithet of Muhammad.\nthe people would overpower you, I would draw with you.' Then a bucket was brought for his lordship to drink.\n\nWhen his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had terminated the ceremonies of the pilgrimage, he remained for some days in the noble city of Mekkah, and then departed to the honoured town of Madinah. After traversing the proper distance, he arrived in Ghadyr Khumm, which is in the vicinity of Hajfah. In that place he halted, held matutinal prayers, turned his face to the companions, and said: 'Are we not above the believers themselves?' But, according to another tradition, he said: 'It seems to me that I am called to the eternal world, and that I have complied. Let it be known unto you that I leave two important matters with you, one of which is more important than the other; I mean the Qur\u00e2n and the members of my house. Take care how you deal with these things after my decease, and how you respect them. For these two subjects will not be separated from each other until they meet me on the bank of the Kawthar.' Then he continued with his wonderfully eloquent tongue: 'Verily, Allah the Most High is my Lord, and I am the lord of the believers.' He then took A'li's hand, exclaiming: 'A'li is the master of those whose master I am. O Allah, his family is my family; his friends are my friends. I injure those who injure him, and I befriend those who aid him. Truth is with him, wherever he is.' The author of these pages says that with reference to this matter, the statement in the Aa'll\u00e2mu-l-war\u00e2 and of the R\u00e2bi'i-l-abr\u00e2r is as follows: When his holy and prophetic lordship arrived in Ghadyr Khumm on his return from Mekkah, he ordered a place to be cleaned under some trees, and the saddles of the camels to be collected and placed in one heap. Then Ball\u00e2l proclaimed prayers by order of his lordship, the people assembled, that prince mounted the heap of saddles, and was at his own desire followed also by A'li, who stood on his right side. After that his lordship the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014poured forth with his propitious tongue praise and gratitude to the Lord of Glory, exhorted the people, informed\nthem of his own [approaching] death, and said: 'I am called to the mansion of eternity. I shall soon comply, and leave you. I leave, however, two things with you, and if you take hold of them you will not go astray. These two things are the book of Allah and my family, which will not separate from each other until they join me on the bank of the lake Kawthar.' Then he said: 'O ye multitude of people, who is nearer to you than your own souls?' They all replied: 'God the Most High and His apostle.' He continued: 'To whomsoever I am nearer than his own soul, to him also A'li is nearer than his own soul.' Then he took off A'li from the pack-saddles of the camels in such a manner that the foot of A'li was on the top of the knee of the prophet, and said: 'Whose lord I am, A'li is also his lord. O Allah, love him whom he loves, and hate him whom he hates. Assist any one who befriends him, and injure everybody who injures him.' Then he came down and sat in his own tent, ordering A'li to sit in another. After that he ordered numbers of persons to go to the tent of A'li and to congratulate him. After they had done so, the mothers of the Believers also went to A'li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014by order of the lord of existences\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and felicitated him. Of the number of the companions present, O'mar B. Alkhatt\u00e2b said: 'Blessed art thou, O A'li; for thou hast been exalted by my lord and by the lord of all the believers of both sexes.'\n\nIt is related that when his holy and prophetic lordship had, after performing the journey, arrived in the vicinity of Madinah, and his blessed eye alighted on the glorious country, he exclaimed: 'There is no God but Allah. He has no partner. His is the kingdom and the glory, and He is omnipotent. We turn to God, praise and worship Him. God has fulfilled His promise, has aided His servants, and He alone has put to flight the confederates.' During this year Ebr\u00e2him, the son of the apostle of God, died in his infancy, and [with reference to this event] A'bdu-r-rahman B. A'wuf says: 'The apostle of God took me by the hand, led me to the bedside of Ebr\u00e2him, and embraced his\nbeloved son, who was in a dying state, and when he perceived him in this condition he wept. I said: \"O apostle of God, do not weep; for thou hast prohibited us to weep.\" But the apostle of God replied: \"I have forbidden you to lament and to cry, to strike your faces and to tear your garments; but to weep is mercy, and he who has no mercy will receive no mercy, O Ebr\u00e2him. Were not the promise of God true, and that all who live must die, I would certainly be more sad than I am. But, although I am grieved to part with thee, and shed tears, I say nothing against the will of God the Most High.\" Bar\u00e2 Ebn Gh\u00e2reb says: 'Ebr\u00e2him died when he was sixteen months old; the prophet prayed over his corpse, and said: \"Ebr\u00e2him has a nurse in paradise, who will complete his suckling time.\"' On the day of his death the sun became darkened, and the people said that an eclipse had taken place on account of this event. His lordship, however, observed: 'Sunshine and moonshine are two indications of the signs of God the Most High and Glorious, and they are eclipsed for the death of no one. If, however, you behold an eclipse; let it become an occasion of prayer to you, that it may be removed.'\n\nEvents of the Eleventh Year after the Flight,415 and Death of his Lordship the Prince of Inspired Messengers\u2014U. W. B.\n\nThe U\u2019lama of biographies\u2014Allah have mercy on them!\u2014have said that when his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had returned to Madinah from the pilgrimage of valediction, he fell sick, and [never quite] recovered again, and that when the news of his indisposition had spread near and far, some persons laid claim to prophecy, such as Moseylamah B. Tham\u00e2mah Hanfy, and Aswad B. Ka'b B. I\u2019sa, and Ttolhah B. Khowylad Asdy, and Shujaa' B. H\u00e2reth B. Sowyd Tamymy. But as, according to the unanimous consent of traditionalists and biographers\n\n415 Began on the 29th March, A.D. 632.\nMoseylamah, and of historians Aswad, were both killed during the time of [the Khalifate of] Ssiddyq, this affair will be narrated in detail among the events of that period, and as T'tolbah as well as Shujaa' likewise put forth their claims at that time, their adventures will likewise be narrated on the said occasion, if it pleaseth Allah the Most High.\n\nOne of the events of this year was that on Monday, the twenty-sixth of the month Ssafar, his lordship issued orders to a number of Musalm\u00e1ns to make preparations for marching against the [Byzantine] Greeks, and that the next day he called As\u00e1mah B. Zayd, and said to him: 'I appoint thee Amir over this army. March in the direction of Mowtah, where thy father was slain. Attack the enemies, set fire to their habitations and goods. Make haste to surprise the people before the news reaches them; nor must thou remain there long if Allah the Most High grants thee victory over them, but return quickly. Take also guides with thee, and despatch spies in advance.' On Wednesday, the twenty-eighth of Ssafar, that prince had a violent fever and headache, and on Thursday he tied, despite of his malady, the banner [of command] with his own propitious hands for As\u00e1mah, saying: 'In the name of Allah, for the religion of Allah, fight those who are unbelievers!' As\u00e1mah went out with the standard, which he gave to Borydah B. Alhassyb, and made him the commander of the army. As\u00e1mah halted in the place Haraf to wait till all the forces were assembled, and his lordship the prophet also ordered Ssiddyq, F\u00e1ri\u00fbq, Dhu-n-n\u00fbryn and other chiefs of the Moh\u00e2jer and nobles of the Auss\u00e1r, to march in that expedition with As\u00e1mah. This arrangement, however, displeased many of the companions, and disapproving of it, they said: 'The apostle of God has made that boy the governor of the Moh\u00e2jer, and of such a [distinguished] company.' When the words of the malecontents had been reported to the favourite of the Boundless Sovereign, he became very irate, tied a cloth over his blessed head, and left his mansion, despite the headache and fever he was\nsuffering from, ascended the pulpit, and said, after offering praises and thanksgivings: 'O ye people, what words of yours do I hear with reference to the commandership of As\u00e2mah? If you blame him this day for being the commander, you have undoubtedly blamed his father when he was in command of the Sariah of Mowtah! I swear by Allah that Zayd was worthy of the command, and that after him his son is likewise worthy thereof! Accept, therefore, in good part what I say about him. He is one of the best among you.' After saying these words his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014came down from the pulpit and returned to his august apartment. This happened on Sunday, the tenth Rabyi' anterior, on which day the men appointed to serve under As\u00e2mah also visited his lordship in crowds to take leave, and then hastened to the camp. On that day also the malady of the apostle of God increased, and on the eleventh of the same month As\u00e2mah left his army to wait upon his lordship, whose bedside he approached, and kissed his head and hands, but the disease had so augmented that his lordship was unable to speak; he, however, raised his hands to heaven, and then placed them on As\u00e2mah. The latter says: 'I knew that he was praying for me.' After that As\u00e2mah went from the apartment of the apostle of God to the camp, spent the night there, and next morning again paid a visit to his lordship. At that time the apostle of God felt better, and when he dismissed As\u00e2mah, he said: 'Go with the blessing of Allah!' He accordingly returned to the camp and issued marching orders, but when he was in the act of mounting [his horse], he received a message from his mother, Omm Aymen, that the apostle of God was in his last agony. Thereon As\u00e2mah returned, and the companions likewise. The campaigns of As\u00e2mah during the Khalifate of Ssiddyq will soon be narrated, if it pleaseth Allah the Most High.\n\nNow we shall go to the end of the matter. In most biographical works it is recorded that Ssiddyqah\\textsuperscript{416} said:\n\n\\textsuperscript{416} I.e., A'ayshah, the favourite spouse of the prophet and daughter of Abu Bakr Ssiddyq.\n\u2018On a certain night during the month Ssafar the apostle of God awoke from sleep and desired to go out, whereon I asked: \u201cMay my father and mother be a sacrifice for thee! Where art thou going?\u201d He replied: \u201cI am commanded to pray for pardon in the Baqyi\u2019 cemetery.\u201d He then took his freed man Abu M\u00fbyah to accompany him, but according to another tradition he went with Abu Rafi\u2019, under whose orders Abu M\u00fbyah was.\u2019 Abu M\u00fbyah says: \u2018When we arrived in the cemetery of Baqyi\u2019 he prayed for the people buried there, and uttered so many good wishes in their favour that I longed to be one of them, in order to share in the [effects of the] prayers he offered. After that he harangued the dead as follows: \u201cMay ye enjoy well the favours which you have received as a gift of God. Blessed be the place by the infinite graces whereby ye have departed [to the next world], and have been delivered from the dissensions which have beset the people like dark clouds following each other, the first whereof have joined the last, and the end whereof is worse than the beginning.\u201d\u2019 In fine, Abu M\u00fbyah says: \u2018When his lordship had ceased speaking, he turned to me, and said: \u201cO Abu M\u00fbyah, the world and its treasures have been offered to me, and I have been left the option to remain in the world, and after that to enter paradise or to meet my Lord.\u201d I said: \u201cO apostle of God, may my father and mother be a sacrifice for thee! Thou hast selected the treasures of the world, the abode therein, and after it paradise.\u201d But he replied: \u201cI have elected [to meet] my Creator, and after that [to dwell in] paradise; I renounce the treasures of the world, and everything else except God.\u201d\u2019\n\nIt is related of Ssiddyqah that she said: \u2018When the apostle of God was well, I heard him say that every prophet was, before his departure, allowed the option between this and the next world; and when the lethal disease had subdued his exalted nature, he occasionally exclaimed: \u201c[I am] with those prophets, saints, and martyrs whom Thou hast favoured, and they are the best companions [for me].\u201d After that he said: \u201cWith the\nhighest companions.\" Then I knew that his lordship had been left the option, and that he had selected the eternal world.' There is a tradition that on a certain night the prophet had been ordered to go to Baqyi', and to pray for those who were buried there. That prince obeyed, and when he returned from Baqyi' to the house he fell asleep. Then he was again told to pray for the dead at Baqyi', and he did so for the second time, returned to his august apartment, but fell asleep again, and he was yet rejoicing when he was again ordered to go and to pray for the martyrs. His lordship therefore hastened in the direction of Ohod, and having prayed for them in that place, he returned, but was afflicted by a headache, in consequence whereof he wrapped his head up in a turban.\\textsuperscript{417} It is said that after he had implored pardon for the persons interred at Baqyi, he informed his friends of his own departure, and in the Moqassadu-l-war\u0101 we read that on Wednesday, when two nights of the month Ssafar were still remaining, his lordship was attacked by fever in the house of Maym\u016bnah very violently, but whenever the disease abated he came out and prayed with the people; in the contrary case, however, he used to send word to them to pray without him; but the fever became so strong and continuous that it deprived him of consciousness.\n\nIn the Aa'll\u0101mu-l-war\u0101 we read that the prophet began to feel unwell on Saturday or Sunday, during the end of the month Ssafar, took hold of the hand of A'li, and, preceded by a number of friends, arrived at Baqyi', where he said: 'Greeting to you, O denizens of the tombs. May you enjoy what is coming. Troubles have arrived like pieces of a dark night; the former are connected with the latter, and they follow each other.' Then he said: 'Be it known unto you that Jebr\u0101il recites the Qur\u0101n to me once every year; but this year he has done it ten times. I know he has done this, because my end is at hand.' He also\n\n\\textsuperscript{417} The word being Es's\u0101bet, may also be a fillet only, which the Arabs usually wear round their heads.\nsaid: 'O A'li, I have been left the choice to receive the treasures of this world and to remain therein, or to dwell in paradise, but I have elected to meet God the Most High, and [after that to dwell in] paradise. When I expire thou art to wash my body, and to cover my pudenda, so that no one may see them without being struck with blindness. After having washed my body, thou art to drink the water remaining in the cavity of my navel, and of the cavities of my eyes, that thou mayest inherit the knowledge of the prophets of former and of latter times.' After that he returned to his house, and was sick three days. On Wednesday he came out and went to the mosque, but his head was tied up, and he reclined against A'li the Commander of the Faithful, who was on the right, and against A'bbas, who sat on the left side of the pulpit. After praising God the Most High, he said: 'O ye people, be it known unto you that the time has indeed come for me to depart from among you. Therefore, every one to whom I am indebted must tell me, so that I may pay him.' Then a man rose and said: 'O apostle of God, I have a claim on thee, and thou hast told me that thou wilt give me money.' The prophet replied: 'Fadzl, give him the three Oqyahs which I handed to thee.' Then he came down and went home.\n\nOn Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday he mounted the pulpit and preached as follows: 'O ye people, verily between God the Most High and yourselves there is nothing by which you may obtain something or ward off evil, except [good] works. O ye people, no one is to lay false claims, or to wish for anything but the truth. I swear by that God who has sent me in reality to mankind, that He rewards mankind for [good] works only, or from His mercy\u2014glory be to Him! Had I, who am a prophet, committed sin, I would have perished.' Then he raised his hands and said: 'O God Most High, have I promulged Thy message or not?' This he repeated thrice, and came down, held the prayers, and afterwards sitting [a while] with the people, he went to the house of Omm Solmah, where he remained one or two days. Then Ssiddyqah came and\nrequested him to go to her house, actually taking him there; but the disease of his lordship increased.\n\nThe author of these pages states that the above account is that of the *Aa'll\u00e2nu-l-war\u00e2*, but all the U'lama of biography and historiographers have a tradition of Ssiddyqah that she said: 'The beginning of the sickness of the apostle of God was in the house of Maym\u00fbnah, and when the day of my turn\\(^{418}\\) arrived he came to my apartment. I also had the headache, and said, \"O my head!\" and he replied: \"How would it be if thou wert to die before me, and I were to shroud and to bury thee, and to pray over thy body?\" My jealousy, however, made me retort: \"O apostle of God, this is thy wish, and I think that on the very day of my burial thou wouldst celebrate a wedding with another wife in my apartment.\" He smiled at this remark, and said: \"But I exclaim, O my head!\" These words implied that Ssiddyqah would recover, but that his lordship would die of his malady.\n\nSsiddyqah continues: 'After that the apostle of God returned to the house of Maym\u00fbnah, and his disease augmented.' It is related that while in the house of Maym\u00fbnah his lordship was overpowered by his malady, and that the mothers of the Musalm\u00e2ns [i.e., his wives] hastened to wait upon him, desiring to be his nurses; but he several times repeated the words: 'Where shall I be to-morrow?' They ascertained that he desired to go to the apartment of Ssiddyqah, and all assented. There is, however, also an opinion current that the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014uttered the above words as if asking permission from the ladies, sitting in the chambers of modesty, to go to the house of Ssiddyqah. At all events, his pure spouses having assented to his wish, his lordship departed from the house of Maym\u00fbnah, leaning with one hand on A'bb\u00e2s, and with the other on A'li the Commander of the Faithful, trailing his blessed feet along the ground, till he reached the house of\n\n\\(^{418}\\) It is well known that Musalm\u00e2ns cohabit with their wives by turns according to a certain routine. For Hindu customs in this matter see the 'Kama Sutra' of Vatsay\u00e2na.\nSsiddyqah, where he fell asleep on the couch of debility. Some allege that his lordship was taken up in his Red\u00e1, and conveyed to the [various] apartments of the mothers of the Musalm\u00e1ns, as he had been accustomed to go at the time when he visited each of them in her turn. A\u2019bdullah B. O\u2019mar says that Ssiddyq had requested the apostle of God to be allowed to nurse him in sickness, but his lordship replied: \u2018O Abu Bakr, if I allow others besides my wives to take care of me during my malady, their calamity will be greater; but thy reward is with Allah the Most High and Glorious.\u2019\n\nOmm Solmah says: \u2018The apostle of God during his sickness tied a turban on his blessed head, mounted the pulpit, and first implored pardon for the martyrs of Ohod, and after that he ordered the doors of the houses of the companions which faced the mosque to be shut, except that of A\u2019li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014saying: \u201cI cannot do without his company, nor he without mine.\u201d O\u2019mar, however, said: \u201cO apostle of God, wilt thou permit me to leave only a crevice, large enough to see thy coming out from thy house through the hole?\u201d His lordship being disinclined to consent, one of the friends asked: \u201cO apostle of God, what was the reason for ordering the doors to be opened, and afterwards to be shut?\u201d And his lordship said: \u201cThey were neither opened nor shut by my orders.\u201d\n\nSsiddyqah says: \u2018In the agony of his disease, the apostle of God sometimes moaned and sometimes rolled on his side, whereon I said: \u201cO apostle of God, if any of us were to do such things thou wouldst surely become angry.\u201d He replied: \u201cO A\u2019ayshah, my disease is extremely violent. Verily, God the Most High and Glorious sends heavy and great calamities upon Musalm\u00e1ns and virtuous persons; nor is there a single believer whom evil does not befall, were it only as much as a thorn in his foot; but for that reason God the Most High exalts His dignity.\u201d\u2019 There is also a tradition that Ssiddyqah said: \u2018I had never seen a more violent distemper than that of the apostle of God.\u2019 It is related that one of the companions said: \u2018I paid a\nvisit to the prophet, and on that occasion he was covered with a Qottyfah,\\textsuperscript{419} which I touched, and found so warm that I could not feel his body, whereat I was so astonished that I exclaimed: \"Praise be to Allah!\" And his lordship said: \"No persons suffer greater calamities than prophets; and their misery being double, their reward is likewise so. God the Most High and Glorious had so tried some of them with poverty and want that they possessed but one garment for wear either in the day or night. The joy of some of them was, nevertheless, greater in their misfortune than your joy [in your prosperity].\"\n\nThe mother of Bashar B. Bar\u0101 says: 'During the mortal disease of the apostle of God I was at his bedside, and he had a burning fever. I said: \"O apostle of God, I never saw anyone having such a fever.\" He replied: \"It is because my reward will be double.\" Then he asked: \"O mother of Bashar, what are the people saying with reference to my malady?\" I replied: \"The people imagine that the blessed body of the apostle of God suffers from pleurisy.\" He observed: \"It is not in conformity with the favour and beneficence of God the Most High and Glorious to subject His apostle to that disease, because that malady is one of the tricks of Satan, and Satan has no power over me; but this sickness is a sequel of the poisoned meat which I ate with thy son in Khayber. These pains I have repeatedly felt, but now the time is at hand when the thread of my life will be cut in twain.\"\n\nThere is a tradition of A'bdullah B. Masu'd, that one month before his decease his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had assembled his companions in the apartment of Ssiddyqah, and said: 'God the Most High and Blessed salutes you, bestows His mercy on you, keeps you, destroys anything that may injure you, cares for your sustenance, presents you with everything advantageous in the religion and in the world, grants you a place in the shadow of His protection, preserving you from all calamities and evils. I recommend you to be abstemious, and to beware of the evil\n\n\\textsuperscript{419} Velvet, satin, and also a species of carpet.\nconsequences of heedlessness. I pray to Allah to guard you, and I make Him\u2014whose magnificence be glorified\u2014my successor over you. I recommend you to fear God the Most High, whose apostle I am. Do not oppress or injure believers; for God has warned me and you of the \"eternal world\" till the end of the verse.\" He also said: 'Is not the habitation of the proud in hell?' When he had finished his injunctions, I asked: 'O apostle of God, when will the time of thy departure be?' He replied: 'It is near at hand. The time to separate from my companions and to meet the Lord of lords, and the mansion of recompense, has arrived.' I asked: 'O apostle of God, who will wash thee?' He said: 'The men of my family nearest related to me.' I continued: 'Of what shall we make thy winding-sheet?' He said: 'Wrap me in the same clothes which I have now on my body, or in Egyptian garments, or in a Yemeni dress.' I continued: 'Who shall pray over thee?' And, being overpowered by my feelings, I wept. The apostle of God also wept, and said: 'Be ye quiet and not confused, for God will have mercy with the efforts you made in the cause of religion for the apostle of the Lord of both worlds, and will reward you. When you have washed me you must wrap me in funeral garments, place me on a stage, leave the latter on the margin of the grave, and recede therefrom for an hour, because the first to pray over my body will be Jebr\u00e2il\u2014u. w. b.\u2014after him Myk\u00e2yl\u2014u. w. b.\u2014then Esr\u00e2fil\u2014u. w. b.\u2014then A'zrayil\u2014u. w. b.

The men of my family are to begin to pray for me, then the women of my family, and after that yourselves. Salute my absent friends, and greet all who will embrace my religion from this day till the day of the resurrection.' Abu Sa'yd Hadhary says that in his mortal sickness the apostle of God came out one day from the\n\n420 The two words 'eternal world' were not sufficient to enable one to find the precise chapter and verse, because they occur so often in the Qur\u00e2n.\napartment of A\u2019ayshah, mounted the pulpit, preached a sermon, and, exhorting his companions on that occasion, said: \u2018God the Most High and Glorious has given to His servant the choice between this world and His reward, but he has selected the latter.\u2019 At these words Abu Bakr commenced to weep, and we wondered what occasion there was for crying at this information; at last, however, we learnt that he had by his high intellect and penetration understood that the servant here meant was the prophet himself. He also said in that sermon: \u2018Verily, had I taken a friend besides my Creator, I would have selected Abu Bakr for my friend. Brotherhood, however, in Isl\u00e2m is a perfect advantage, and this rank and dignity he has attained.\u2019 It is related of Ssiddyqah that she said: \u2018In manners, behaviour, and excellent qualities I have never seen a person resembling the apostle of God\u2014u. w. b.\u2014more than Fattimah\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and whenever she paid him a visit he rose to honour her, went to meet her, and caused her to take her seat in his own place. When the apostle of God visited Fattimah\u2014u. w. b.\u2014she acted in the same manner towards him. In his last sickness he called his beloved daughter, and when Fattimah\u2014u. w. b.\u2014approached his lordship, the apostle of God said, \u2018Welcome, my daughter,\u2019 seated her by his side, and whispered something into her ear which made her cry; but thereon the apostle of God again secretly conversed with her, and she smiled as if pleased.\u2019 A\u2019ayshah relates: \u2018On that occasion I said to Fattimah: \u201cI never saw grief so quickly changed to joy as now. What is the reason for it?\u201d Fattimah, however, refused to yield any information, and said: \u201cI shall not reveal the secret of the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u201d When the apostle of God had departed from this perishable to the imperishable world, I asked her: \u201cWhat were the words the apostle had spoken to thee?\u201d She replied: \u201cOn the first occasion he said: \u2018Jebr\u00e2\u00eel used to recite the Qur\u00e2n to me once every year; this year, however, he has done so ten times, and I think my death is at hand.\u2019 Therefore I cried. On the second occasion he said: \u2018Thou wilt be the\nfirst person of my family who will meet me.' At these words I rejoiced.\" Some allege that the prince of this world\u2014u. w. b.\u2014uttered both the above sentiments in the first conversation with Fattimah, and that he said in the second: 'Art thou not willing to be the princess of the women inhabiting paradise?' After that he said: 'Jebr\u00e2\u00eel has informed me that no Musalm\u00e2n woman will enjoy higher dignity than my daughter.'\n\nThe U'lam\u00e2 of biographies have related that at the time when the sickness of the apostle of Allah increased, and the companions assembled in his apartment, he exclaimed: 'Bring an inkstand, with a sheet, that I may write something which will never be lost after me.' Some desired to comply with this order, while others said: 'Will the words be like those he utters from the violence of his disease, or serious ones?' O'mar said: 'Pain and suffering have overpowered the apostle of God, and we possess the Qur\u00e2n which we approve of.' Many agreed with the opinion of O'mar, while others insisted on the production of the writing materials asked for, so that a dispute arose, which was carried on with great confusion and noise. Hereon his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014said: 'Go away from me; for it is unseemly to quarrel in the presence of a prophet.' He nevertheless added: 'I enjoin you three things: The first is, that you expel the idolaters from Mesopotamia; the second is, that when you are visited by deputations [Wof\u00fbd] of Arabs, you make them presents, as I was in the habit of doing.' Suleym\u00e2n, who has his account from Sa'yd B. Jobayr, says: 'I know that Sa'yd B. Jobayr did not think proper to divulge the third injunction, although he excused himself by saying: \"The cobwebs of oblivion are impairing my mind.\"' A'bb\u00e2s says: 'It was a great misfortune that some of the companions would not allow the apostle of God to write his last will.' There is a tradition that when his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014\n\n421 Some European authors, and among them also Dr. A. Sprenger, have from the above words, as well as from other indications, drawn the conclusion that the prophet was not only able to read, but also to write.\nu. w. b.\u2014was overpowered by disease, he said: 'Pour on me water from seven bags, filled from seven wells, and mayhap I shall be relieved and go out of the house to exhort the people.' This having been actually done, that prince felt relieved, went out from the house, and held prayers with the people, preached a sermon, and after having offered praises to the Most High, he asked pardon for the martyrs of Ohod, whereon he continued: 'Verily the Anss\u00e2r are my intimate friends. Honour those of them who are good, and forgive those who are bad. I swear by Allah, in whose power my life is, that I love them. They have done their duty; they have acted honestly and bravely.' Some historians narrate that when the Anss\u00e2r perceived the disease of his holy and prophetic lordship increasing day by day, they were distressed and confused, so that most of them roamed, with heavy hearts and blood-shot eyes, around the mosque of his lordship, because they were unable quietly to remain in their houses, and to withdraw the feet of gravity under the skirts of patience. A\u2019bb\u00e2s B. A\u2019bd-ul-Muttalleb with his son Fadzl, and A\u2019li B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb\u2014u. w. b.\u2014entered the august apartment after each other, and informed his lordship of what was going on. The apostle of God thereon erected himself and sat upright on the couch by the aid of his friends, and asked what the Anss\u00e2r were saying. A\u2019li B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb replied: 'The Anss\u00e2r say: \"We are afraid and terrified that the apostle of God will leave this world, and we do not know what will become of us.\"' When the sentiments of the Anss\u00e2r had become known to the prince of the righteous, he rose, and placing one of his hands upon the back of A\u2019li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and the other upon that of Fadzl, he trailed his blessed feet along the ground, and was preceded by A\u2019bb\u00e2s. They walked in this way till they entered the mosque, where the prophet sat down on the first step of the pulpit. When the Musalm\u00e2ns heard of this, they assembled in the mosque; and after he had praised, glorified, and thanked God the Most High, he spoke as follows: 'O my people, I hear that you fear I shall die. Is there any\nprophet who remained alive for ever, that I should likewise remain with you for ever? Be it known unto you that I and you must return to God the Most High and Glorious. I enjoin you to act kindly towards the first Moh\u00e2jer. I recommend the Moh\u00e2jer and yourselves to live amicably with each other.' Then he recited the S\u00fbrah Wala'ssir,\\(^{422}\\) and said: 'All well-ordered affairs and their success depend upon the permission of Allah the Most High. Let nothing induce you to act hastily in any matter, because the Lord, whose name be blessed and exalted, is rash in nothing and for no one. Whoever attempts to overcome the decree of Allah the Most High will be overcome thereby, and whoever tries to deceive Allah the Most High will himself be deceived and disappointed.' He recited also the blessed verse: 'Were ye ready, if you had been put in authority, to act wickedly on earth and to deny your relatives?'\\(^{423}\\) Then he said: 'O ye Moh\u00e2jer, I recommend you to deal kindly and amicably with the Anss\u00e2r; for they have kept ready for you the place of your flight and the locality of our exile, namely, Madinah, and have professed the Faith before you met them. They shared with you their gardens and the fruits thereof. They received you in their houses and gave you places in their lands. They preferred to relieve your necessities rather than their own, and jeopardized their lives for you. Let any man who becomes their governor be the friend of those who treat them well, and disregard the wishes of those who bear them ill-will.' Then he continued: 'O ye Anss\u00e2r, after my decease other people will be preferred to you.' The Anss\u00e2r asked: 'O apostle of God, how shall we deal with them?' He replied: 'Be patient until you join me on the bank of the Kawthar.' When the conversation had reached this stage, A'bb\u00e2s requested permission to speak, and said: 'O apostle of God, issue orders also with reference to the Qoraish.' His lordship said: 'I enjoin the Qoraish to obey my successor;\n\n\\(^{422}\\) Chapter ciii. of the Qur\u00e2n, 'The afternoon,' which consists of three short verses only.\n\n\\(^{423}\\) Qur\u00e2n, ch. xlvii. 24.\nthe people to obey the Qoraish; the good and the virtuous to follow the good and the virtuous; and the bad and the wicked to follow the bad and the wicked.' After these delightful sentiments he added a few injunctions to the Qoraish, and then returned to his august apartment.\n\nFadzl B. A'bb\u00e1s says: 'During the time the apostle of God was sick, he one day wrapped his head in a turban, took me by the hand, left the house, went to the mosque, ascended the pulpit, ordered Ball\u00e1l to assemble the people, and said: \"I desire to exhort the Musalm\u00e1ns, tell them therefore, This is the last injunction of the apostle of God with reference to you.\" Ballal obeyed, and promulged in the public places of Madinah the orders he had received. When the people heard the voice of Ball\u00e1l and his invitation, they left their houses and shops open as they were, and hastened to wait on the prince of the world. The young and the old, the small and the tall, hastened to the mosque, where the crowd was so large that scarcely two persons more could have entered it. After his lordship had offered praises and thanks to God the Most High, he said: \"I shall soon depart from among you; let everyone whom I have injured in body or mind arise and plead for retaliation, and let everyone to whom I owe any money take it from my property; and let no one say: 'I am afraid that if I take revenge the apostle of God will hate me and will be my enemy.' Such is not my nature. I am far from harbouring such feelings. I love him most who requires me to pay him what I owe him, or who absolves me from all liability, that I may depart to the forgiving Sovereign with a free and spotless conscience, and I believe you will not disapprove of what I have now uttered.\" Fadzl continues: 'After these words he came down from the pulpit, held the matutinal prayers, ascended the pulpit again, and reiterated his former challenge, whereon a man arose and said: \"O apostle of God, thou owest me three dirhems.\" That prince replied: \"I do not think thou art a liar, nor do I wish anyone to swear an oath who proffers such\nclaims, but tell me how I owe thee these dirhems.\u201d The man said: \u201cO apostle of God, one day a poor man spoke to thee, and thou hast ordered me to give him three dirhems.\u201d His lordship then said: \u201cFadzl, give him three dirhems.\u201d After that his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014said: \u201cO ye men, let every one who owes me anything pay it to-day, and do not let him say: \u2018I am ashamed of the scorn of the world,\u2019 for the scorn of this world is easily endured, but not that of the next.\u201d On this occasion a man rose, and said: \u201cI have unjustly appropriated three dirhems for my own use from the spoils.\u201d Being asked why he had done this, he said: \u201cI was in want of money.\u201d The prophet continued: \u201cFadzl, take that sum from him.\u201d He then said: \u201cLet any man who is subject to the qualities worthy of blame inform me of them, that I may pray for him.\u201d Accordingly an individual rose, and said: \u201cO apostle of God, I am a liar, a profligate, and addicted to much sleep.\u201d He exclaimed: \u201cO God, present him with veracity, and dispel his sleep whenever he desires to indulge therein.\u201d Then another man rose, and said: \u201cO apostle of God, I am a liar and a hypocrite, nor is there any sinful act which I have not perpetrated.\u201d Here O\u2019mar interrupted him, saying: \u201cO man, thou hast disgraced thyself.\u201d But his lordship said: \u201cIt is more easy to support disgrace in this world than in the next. O God Most High, make him veracious and give him Faith. Turn his heart from evil to good.\u201d Then O\u2019mar uttered something, which made him smile and say: \u201cO\u2019mar is with me and I with O\u2019mar, and the truth is with O\u2019mar wherever he may be.\u201d\n\nA\u2019li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014said: \u2018In his last sickness the prophet issued his injunctions, and when he had terminated them the S\u00fbrah \u201cWhen the aid of Allah shall come\u201d\\(^{424}\\) was revealed, and I said: \u201cO apostle of God, this injunction seems to be valedictory.\u201d He replied: \u201cYes, O A\u2019li, for my heart is distressed in this world.\u201d Then he sat down, closed his eyes awhile, and\n\n\\(^{424}\\) Qur\u00e2\u0144, ch. cx., which is very short.\nwhen he again awoke he said: \"O Jebrail, aid me, and fulfil thy promise.\" After that he called me near himself, placed his head in my lap; his august countenance was changed, and his open forehead perspired amply. Fattimah, who saw what was taking place, jumped up distressed, took the hands of Hasan and Husayn, and exclaimed: \"O my father, who will after thy decease cast a glance of pity at the state of thy daughter Fattimah? Who will cherish thy grandsons Hasan and Husayn? Who will instruct A'li? Who will deal with the people that will come from various countries? O father, may my life be a sacrifice for thine! Woe to my ears which will never hear thy sweet speech, and to my eyes which will never behold thy pleasant countenance!\" When his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014heard the groans and lamentations of Fattimah\u2014u. w. b.\u2014he opened his eyes, called her, placed his blessed head on the bosom of his beloved daughter, and said: \"O God Most High, vouchsafe patience to Fattimah.\" Then he said: \"O Fattimah, I congratulate thee, for thou wilt join me before any other person. O light of my eyes, thy father is in the agony of death.\" Fattimah then began to weep and to lament aloud, losing all her self-possession. A'li continues: 'I said: \"O Fattimah, be quiet, and do not strew salt on the wound of the apostle of God.\" That prince, however, said: \"Allow her to shed tears for her father.\" Then he closed his propitious eyes. Fattimah\u2014u. w. b.\u2014said to Hasan and Husayn: \"Arise, and go to your dear [grand] father; perhaps he may give you some advice.\" According to another tradition, however, she said: \"Mayhap he will give you something which will pacify your hearts.\" The two darlings then approached the apostle of God by the advice of their mother, and Hasan asked: \"O my noble grandfather, how can we endure being separated from thee, and to whom can we confide our distress? Who will, after thy departure, show kindness to me, to my mother, to my father, and to my brother? Who will treat the people and thy wives as kindly as thou wast accustomed to do, and who will take\ncare of them?\" At these words the mothers of the believers, who were present near the bedside of that prince, raised a shout of distress.\n\nA'li B. Abu T\u00e1leb says: 'I wept from grief, and a number of the companions, who were in attendance at the door of the apartment, as steadfastly as the ring attached to [the door of] it, exclaimed: \"O Muhammad, who will console thy people when thou art gone?\" They said: \"O A'li, open the door, that we may once more behold the propitious countenance of the apostle of God, and cast a glance at the world-adorning pulchritude thereof.\" The apostle of God, hearing the shrieks and lamentations of the companions, said: \"O A'li, open the door for my friends.\" I obeyed; whereon the principal Moh\u00e1jer and Anss\u00e1r entered, whom his lordship immediately admonished to be patient and quiet, saying: \"Ye are the cream of the people, and the essence of the inhabitants of the world. Although your appearance on earth happened to be the last of all nations, your entrance into paradise will take place before all the others. Be ye steadfast and constant in keeping the ordinances of God, make the Qur\u00e1n your guide, and do not neglect the commandments of the religion.\" Then he said: \"O God, I have finished.\" He closed his blessed eyes, drops of perspiration appeared on his august countenance, and I made a sign to the companions to leave the apartment. Hereon A'ayshah asked for advice, and he said: \"O A'ayshah, you must remain quietly in your houses and be patient, as God the Most High says, 'And your houses.'\" Uttering these words he wept, so that the tears of his lordship kindled the fire of misfortune in the hearts of all who were present, and Omm Solmah asked: \"As all thy sins are forgiven, why weepest thou?\" He replied: \"Indeed, I wept from compassion for my people.\" Then he congratulated Fattimah, and she asked him: \"Where shall I find thee on the day of the greatest fear [i.e., on the day of the resurrection]?\" His lordship said: \"Thou wilt find me at the tree beneath the flag of Ahmad, whilst I shall be engaged in praying to\nthe Merciful One, to forgive all nations.\u201d She asked: \u201cIf I do not find thee there, where shall I seek thee?\u201d He replied: \u201cNear the bridge Sser\u00e4tt, when I shall be standing there to pray for them and to plead for their safety.\u201d She continued: \u201cIf I cannot find thee there either, where must I seek thee?\u201d He said: \u201cNear the Balance, where I shall be engaged in praying for peace.\u201d She continued: \u201cIf I do not meet thee in that place either, where will you be?\u201d He rejoined: \u201cOn the brink of hell, where I shall be standing to ward off the calamity of fire from my people.\u201d Fattimah having thus been comforted, he closed his propitious eyes again. Next morning, at dawn, Ball\u0101l shouted the [usual] call to prayers, and his lordship said: \u201cGo, that everyone who likes may pray.\u201d After he had thrice repeated these words, Ball\u0101l said aloud: \u201cCome to prayers; may Allah have mercy on thee!\u201d He, however, replied: \u201cLet me alone, for I am in my last struggle and agony of death!\u201d\n\nIt is related that during his sickness, when the time of prayers was at hand, his lordship used to send out Ball\u0101l until he himself arrived to pray with the people. In his last sickness, however, he was, on account of the great violence thereof, unable to leave the house for three days; and there is a tradition that in his last sickness his lordship omitted seventeen public prayers. Some allege that at the time of the dormitory prayers Ball\u0101l went to the door of the apartment of the apostle of God, and exclaimed: \u2018Prayers, O apostle of God!\u2019 but that his lordship was too sick to come. Those of the Sonna maintain that he\n\n---\n\n425 For their safety, that they may not fall into hell from this bridge, which is finer than a hair and sharper than a sword, but pass over it into paradise. The Sser\u00e4tt is the Chinavat bridge of the Zoroastrians.\n\n426 The Turks and the majority of Arabs are Sunnis, but the Persians Shia\u2019hs. The Sonna is what the prophet generally observed, and sometimes omitted. If the said general observance relates to religion it is called the \u2018Sonna of guidance\u2019; if to common things it is called \u2018Sonna of excess.\u2019 By the Sonna of guidance the religion is perfected; its omission entails guilt and wickedness. The taking of the Sonna of excess, for a guide, namely, the observance of it, is good, but its omission entails neither guilt nor wickedness, such as, e.g., the habits of the prophet in rising, sitting, dressing, and eating.\nsaid: 'Tell Abu Bakr to pray with the people.' A'ayshah, however, said: 'Abu Bakr is in a state of great distress and melancholy. When he stands in thy place and begins to recite the prayers he will be overpowered by his tears. Therefore he is unable to lead the prayers. How would it be if thou wert to entrust O'mar with this duty?' Although A'ayshah repeated this suggestion several times, his lordship insisted, saying: 'Tell Abu Bakr to hold the prayers,' but the responsibility rests with the narrator. When A'ayshah perceived that her wish would not be complied with, she instigated Hafssah, the daughter of O'mar, to say to the apostle of God: 'Order O'mar to hold the prayers with the people.' He, however, again rejoined: 'Tell Abu Bakr to hold the prayers with the people!' After his holy and prophetic lordship had intimated his wish that Abu Bakr should hold the prayers, two men went out to Ball\u00e2l and informed him of it. The latter thereon returned weeping and crying aloud: 'Would to God I had died before this time, instead of seeing the apostle of God in this condition!' Then Sh\u00e2 Omm Abu went to Abu Bakr, and said: 'The command has gone forth from the court of prophecy that you pray with the people.' Accordingly Abu Bakr rose with the intention to pray, but when he looked at the Mahr\u00e2b\\(^{427}\\) and saw that the prince of existences\u2014u. w. b.\u2014was not there, he wept so violently that he fainted, and the wailings and lamentations of the congregation were so awful that the Mahr\u00e2b and pulpit groaned from pain; and how beauteous is the saying:\n\nDistich: In my prayers I remembered the arch of thy eyebrow;\nI lost my senses, and even the Mahr\u00e2b groaned!\n\nWhen the tumult of the companions had reached the august hearing, he asked Fattimah Zohr\u00e2: 'What noise is this?' She replied: 'O apostle of God, thy friends are weeping for being separated from thee.' Then his lordship called A'li B. Abu Tt\u00e2'leb and A'bb\u00e2s B. A'bd-ul-Muttalleb,\n\n\\(^{427}\\) The principal spot in the mosque, where the Em\u00e2m prays and leads the devotions with his face turned towards Mekkah.\nand, leaning upon them, proceeded to the mosque, where he held prayers, and, after terminating them, said: 'O my people, ye are under the protection and guardianship of Allah, whose name be glorified! May the Lord most high be my successor over you. You are to be pious, fearing the Lord most high, obeying and honouring Him; and I am about to depart from this world.' In some traditions\u2014and the responsibility rests with their narrators\u2014we read that when Ball\u00e2l had informed the apostle of God of the time for prayers being at hand, the prophet ordered A'bdullah B. Rabya'h to tell the people to hold the prayers. He obeyed, and when he came out from the apartment he met O'mar, to whom he said: 'Hold the prayers with the people.' O'mar accordingly went to the Mahr\u00e2b, and began to lead the prayers; but when his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014heard the recitation of O'mar, he asked: 'Is not that the voice of O'mar?' The persons near him replied: 'Yes.' Then he said: 'God will do this to the believers,' and, putting out his head from the window of the apartment, he thrice repeated with his wonderfully eloquent tongue the words: 'No; Abu Bakr must hold prayers with the people.' This, however, is the assertion of the adherents of the Sonna. O'mar, therefore, stopped praying, and asked A'bdullah B. Rabya'h: 'Has not his lordship told thee that I am to hold the prayers with the congregation?' He replied: 'His lordship has mentioned no name, but as I have not seen Abu Bakr among the friends, I told thee to lead the prayers, because I considered thee to be more fit for that office than the others.' O'mar rejoined: 'I knew not that such was the case, or else I would not have undertaken to officiate.'\n\nIt is related that one day during the last sickness of the apostle of God\u2014u. w. b.\u2014A'li came out from that prince, and that the companions asked him: 'How is the apostle of God to-day?' He replied: 'Thanks be to Allah, he is in the best condition.' A'bb\u00e2s, however, taking hold of A'li's hand, whispered to him: 'After three days the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014will reach the propinquity of the mercy\nof the Lord of both worlds, because I perceive the sign of death upon him. It will, therefore, be proper for us to go to him, and to ask him who is to be his successor. Should he appoint one of ourselves, it will be all well and good, but if it be another, we must have a compact with him.' A'li, however, refused to agree to this proposal, and said: 'If we are not admitted at present to the successorship, we shall never obtain it afterwards. I swear by Allah that I shall not put this question to his lordship, nor covet the honours of this world.'\n\nIt is related that the apostle of God sometimes fainted during his malady, and that on one of these occasions his pure spouses administered to him medicine which they poured into his blessed mouth, and it gave him no pain. When, however, he had recovered from his fit, he learnt what had taken place, and asked of what the medicine consisted. They replied: 'Of a little Indian aloe, some saffron, and a drop of oil.' He continued: 'Who told you to do this?' They said: 'Asm\u00e2, the daughter of O'mys, who also said that this was a fever which had come to you from Abyssinia.' His lordship rejoined: 'What disease do you think I have, that you give me this medicine?' They said: 'We feared it was the pleurisy.' He said: 'That disease is from Satan, and God the Most High has not surrendered me to the power of Satan. Therefore every person whom I now see in this room must swallow some of that medicine, except A'bb\u00e2s, whom I excuse.' Accordingly, by the command of that prince, all the women poured the medicine into each other's mouths, and would not excuse even Maym\u00fbnah, although she was fasting at that time.\n\nIt is related that three days before the death of his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014Jebr\u00e2il came down [from heaven] and said: 'O Muhammad, the Creator greets thee, but asks thee about a matter He knows better than thou. He asks thee how thou feellest?' His lordship replied: 'O faithful spirit of God, I am unhappy and suffering.' After two or three days Jebr\u00e2il came again, and a conversation\ntook place between them as before. On the third day Jebr\u00e2il again made his appearance at the door of the august apartment, with Esma'il [Ishmael], who is the commander of seventy thousand angels, and with A'zrayil. When Jebr\u00e2il had finished his questions, he said: 'Behold, the angel of death is standing at the door, and asking permission to enter, nor has such a thing ever happened to anyone before thee, neither will it happen after thee.' His lordship said: 'O Jebr\u00e2il, allow him to enter.' The angel of death, having obtained admittance, entered, saluted, and said: 'O Muhammad, Allah the Most High has sent me to wait on thee and not to disobey thee. If thou wilt allow me, I shall take hold of thy pure soul and shall convey it to the upper world, or else I shall return [without it].' The apostle of God looked at Jebr\u00e2il as to what he should say, and the Faithful Spirit spoke: 'O Muhammad, God the Most High is anxious to see thee.' Accordingly, the apostle of God beckoned to A'zrayil to execute the behest he had received, and Jebr\u00e2il said to his lordship: 'Farewell, Ahmad! Henceforth I shall no more alight on earth to bring revelations or messages from the Most High, whose name be glorified. On thy account alone I visited the world.'\n\nFor thee we travel,\nSecrets to unravel;\nSpeak only for thee,\nOr silent remain we.\n\nA'b'dullah B. A'bb\u00e2s relates that on the day when his lordship the apostle died, God the Most High and Glorious had spoken to A'zrayil as follows: 'Descend from heaven to earth; go to my favourite, Muhammad, but take care not to accost him discourteously, or to grasp his soul without his permission.' Accordingly, the angel of death departed with one thousand celestial spirits of his assistants, all of them being mounted on piebald horses, and wearing garments encrusted with precious gems, and arrived in our world after traversing the proper distance. A'zrayil assumed the form of an Arab, halted at the door of the apartment of the apostle of God, and said: 'Salutation\nto thee, chief of the prophets and mine of apostleship! Will you allow me to enter, may the mercy of Allah be upon you?' On that occasion Fattimah, who was sitting at the bedside of his lordship, replied: 'The apostle of God is engaged with his own condition, and it is impossible to meet him.' The angel of death then again asked for permission and received the same answer; the third time, however, he asked for admittance in so loud a voice that everyone present in the sacred dwelling trembled for fear on account of the dreadfulness thereof. Thereon the lord of apostleship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014who had been in a trance, recovered consciousness, opened his blessed eyes, and asked: 'What is the matter with you?' Having been informed of what had taken place, he asked: 'O Fattimah, wast thou aware to whom thou hast spoken?' She replied: 'God and His apostle know it best.' He continued: 'This is the angel of death, the destroyer of pleasures, the terminator of aspirations and of hopes. He disperses assemblies, makes orphans of children, and widows of wives.' Fattimah rejoined: 'O father, the city is destroyed!' He then took her hand, pressed it to his blessed bosom, and kept his eyes closed for a long time, so that those who were present thought his noble spirit had taken flight to the throne of the Almighty, and Fattimah, placing her mouth to the ear of that prince, whispered, 'O my father!' but, receiving no answer, continued: 'O my father, may my life be a sacrifice for thine! Consider my state, and speak one word to me.' Thereon his holy and prophetic lordship opened his eyes, and said: 'O my daughter, cease to weep, for the bearers of the throne are weeping because thou weepest.' Then he wiped, with his blessed hand, the tears from the face of his beloved daughter. Trying to pacify her, and to impart glad tidings to her, he said: 'O God, vouchsafe fortitude to her, that she may bear our separation.' Then he said to her: 'When my spirit is being grasped [by the angel of death], pronounce the words: \"We belong to Allah, and to Him we shall\nsurely return.' O Fattimah! whatever calamity befalls a man, he will be requited for it.' Fattimah, however, rejoined: 'O apostle of God, what person, or what thing, could be an equivalent for the loss of thee?' After that his lordship again closed his eyes, and Fattimah continued: 'O father!' The apostle of God replied: 'Hereafter thy father will be subject to no affliction nor pain; because every grief to which human beings are subject depends upon their connection with their mortal bodies; this, however, is now about to be dissolved, and the words \"Return to thy Lord willingly or not\" have reached my ears, O my soul! After these words it would be a shame to remain a denizen of this earth. Thou wilt hasten to be received into the propinquity of the mercy of the Lord of both worlds, wilt behold and enjoy all the blessings of paradise, and wilt suffer neither pain nor grief any more.'\n\nIn fine, when the apostle of God\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had terminated his allocution to Fattimah Zohr\u00e2\u2014u. w. b.\u2014A'ayshah approached, and requested him to impart to her his last wish, whereon he said: 'O A'ayshah, I have imparted it to thee yesterday, and it is the same to-day. Walk according to the commandments of God the Most High, and remember me.' A'ayshah most readily assented to, and even forestalled, all the injunctions of his lordship. Then Hafssah approached him, and he spoke to her in the same manner as to A'ayshah. After that he said to his darling Fattimah: 'Bring thy sons.' She then led Hasan and Husayn to the apostle of God. They saluted him and remained standing opposite to him. When, however, they had contemplated their noble grandfather in this condition, they wept very loudly, and the tongue of the circumstances expressed the feelings of both in the following distich:\n\nI die\u2014not to see him\u2014for fear;\nGod forbid that he should disappear.\n\nThey cried so much that all present were moved to tears. The Em\u00e2m Hasan placed his face on the blessed countenance of his lordship the best of men, and the Em\u00e2m Husayn\n\n428 Qur\u00e2n, ch. ii. 151.\nlaid his head on the bosom of that prince. The apostle of God opened his blessed eyes, looked mercifully and compassionately on them, fondling and kissing them, and enjoined everyone to love them. After that he ordered A\u2019li into his presence, who obeyed, and sat down near his couch. The apostle raised his head from the pillow, the Lord A\u2019li approached, reclined with his head upon the blessed hand of the prophet, and his lordship the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014said: \u2018O A\u2019li, I am indebted to such and such a Jew, for such and such a sum of money, which I have borrowed from him, to fit out the expedition under As\u00e2mah. I beseech thee to repay him. O A\u2019li, the first person who will meet me on the lake Kawthar wilt be thou. After my demise many afflictions will come; grieve not, however, but rather be patient and suffer. When thou beholdest the people coveting the goods of this world, aspire thou to the blessings of the next.\u2019\n\nIn some traditions it is related that his holy and prophetic lordship asked for writing materials from A\u2019li\u2014u. w. b.\u2014but the Commander, fearing he might expire before he carried out his intention, said: \u2018O apostle of God, give me any orders thou likest, because I am able to remember them.\u2019 His lordship then said: \u2018The prayers which your right hands possess.\u2019\n\nThere is a tradition of J\u00e2ber B. A\u2019bdullah the Anssary that during the Khalifate of O\u2019mar, Ka\u2019bu-l-akhb\u00e2r asked him: \u2018O\u2019mar, what were the last words spoken by the apostle before he died?\u2019 O\u2019mar replied: \u2018Ask A\u2019li B. Abu Tt\u00e1leb.\u2019 Ka\u2019b accordingly questioned A\u2019li, who replied: \u2018When his lordship reclined on my breast, and placed his head on my shoulder, he said: \u201cThe prayers! The prayers!\u201d\u2019 And Ka\u2019b rejoined: \u2018This is the last injunction of prophets. They are commanded to do so, and their mission amounts to this.\u2019 A\u2019li continued: \u2018When the apostle of God uttered these words, and the saliva from\n\n429 This phrase is precisely the same as one where the laws of marriage are laid down, only in lieu of prayers which your right hands possess, we read, maid-servants which your right hands possess.\u2014See Qur\u00e2n, ch. iv. 29.\nhis blessed mouth fell upon me, his condition became suddenly changed, and I was grieved to see him in that state; I therefore called out to A\u2019bb\u00e1s: \u201cHelp me!\u201d He accordingly approached me, and we laid that prince down on his couch.\u2019\n\nWe read in some biographical works that when A\u2019zrayil entered the sacred mansion in the form of an Arab, he said: \u2018Salutation to thee, O prophet! God the Most High and Glorious sends thee His greeting, and orders me not to grasp thy soul without thy consent till Jebr\u00e2il arrives.\u2019 Then the Lord of Glory spoke to the possessor of hell as follows: \u2018The pure spirit of my friend Muhammad is about to be conveyed to heaven. Extinguish the fire of hell!\u2019 To the H\u00fbris with large eyes the following revelation was communicated: \u2018Adorn yourselves. For the soul of Muhammad will arrive.\u2019 The denizens of the altitudes, and the dwellers in the upper world, were ordered to stand in lines, and the Faithful Spirit [Jebr\u00e2il] received the following order: \u2018Go to the earth, to Muhammad my favourite.\u2019 Jebr\u00e2il obeyed, and made his appearance weeping at the bedside of the prophet, whereon his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014said to him: \u2018My friend, wilt thou abandon me in this condition?\u2019 Jebr\u00e2il replied: \u2018O Muhammad, I congratulate thee, for I have brought thee news which will please thee.\u2019 His lordship asked: \u2018What good news hast thou brought?\u2019 He replied: \u2018The fire of hell has been extinguished, the gardens of paradise have been adorned, the H\u00fbris with large eyes are decorated, and the angels are drawn up standing in lines, and waiting for the advent of thy soul.\u2019 His lordship replied: \u2018This is all well and good, but tell me something that will rejoice and delight my soul.\u2019 Jebr\u00e2il continued: \u2018None of the prophets nor any of their followers are allowed to go to paradise until thou and thy people have entered it.\u2019 His lordship said: \u2018Increase my joy.\u2019 And Jebr\u00e2il said: \u2018O Muhammad, the Lord Most High, whose name be blessed and exalted, will grant thee several things, which He has not vouchsafed to bestow on any of the noble prophets;\nthe lake Kawthar; the laudable spot; intercession for thy people will be granted to thee, and on the morn of the resurrection many of thy adherents will be restored to thee to rejoice thee.' The apostle of God said: 'Now my heart has become glad, and my eyes lit up.' Then he turned his face to A'zrayil, and said: 'Come nearer, and do what thou hast been ordered to do.' The angel having thus obtained permission from his lordship, engaged in the operation of severing his lordship's pure spirit from his body. When the agony of death had so overcome him that the hue of his blessed countenance sometimes turned red and sometimes yellow, he dipped his hand into a cup of water which was near him, passed it over his face, and said: 'O God, help me in my last agony!' As the perspiration covered his glorious face, he continued to wipe it off, sometimes with his right and sometimes with his left hand, until the governor of the city of life [i.e., the soul] withdrew his hand from ruling his incomparable body.\n\nIt is related that when this prince was in his last agony he looked at the ceiling of the apartment, raised his hand, and said: 'The Most High is my Companion!' He then dropped his hand again, and departed to the eternal world. On that occasion the inmates of the nuptial chambers of modesty raised shrieks of lamentation and wailing. Fattimah Zohr\u00e2 said: 'Alas, my father, thou hast responded to the call of the Almighty! Alas, my father, the gardens of paradise are thy dwelling-place! Alas, my father, thy death makes Jebr\u00e2\u00eel exclaim: \"O apostle of God! O prophet of mercy! We shall receive no more revelations!\" Nor will Jebr\u00e2\u00eel visit us. O God Most High, cause the soul of Fattimah to join his soul! O God Most High, cause me to participate in the reward of Thy favourite, and do not exclude me on the day of the resurrection from his intercession!' And Ssiddyqah cried aloud: 'Alas for the prophet who has preferred poverty to riches, and destitution to opulence!\u2014\n\nO my heart, truth teaches you\nTo prefer poverty to riches.\n'Alas for the pious man who never slept during whole nights on the couch of rest from grief for the sins and transgressions of his people; who constantly practised patience, who never ceased to combat evil passions, who never gave a thought to forbidden things, who was never morose, who never closed the gates of beneficence and liberality against the poor and destitute! His brilliant teeth were broken by stones which his miserable foes had thrown at him! His forehead of happy presage was enveloped in the turban of the vicissitudes of the times! His blessed stomach was for two consecutive days deprived of the nourishment even of barley bread!'\n\nIt is related that when the holy soul of his lordship had departed from his unparalleled body, the males of the family entered the august apartment, and a curtain was suspended between them and the ladies. A voice, the owner of which could not be discovered, then uttered the following words: 'Salutation to you, O ye members of the family! The blessing and mercy of God be on you! All who live must die, but you shall receive your reward for all your calamities and misfortunes from the Supreme Judge. Be comforted, trust in the Lord, and take refuge with Him. Because, indeed, he only is struck by misfortune who is excluded from Divine favour.' When this allocution had ceased, A'li B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb\u2014u. w. b.\u2014asked the companions: 'Do you know the speaker?' They replied: 'No.' He said: 'It was Khizer,' who has brought us consolation.'\n\nIt is related that when a number of companions, who were in the mosque, heard the wailings and lamentations of the females on account of the death of his lordship the refuge of termination, they were so confused that some became dumb, some mad, and some fell sick. It is on record that when his lordship the receptacle of the apostolate expired, O'mar B. Alkhatt\u00e2b shouted to the people, and swore that the apostle of God had not died, but had fallen into a\n\n430 This prophet is alluded to in the words 'one of our servants' in Qur\u00e2n, ch. xviii, 64. His soul is believed to have by metempsychosis passed successively through Phineas, Elias, and St. George. About his meeting with Moses see Part I., vol. i., of this series, pp. 371-377.\ntrance like Moses. He said: 'I swear by Allah that his lordship will yet remain alive in this world until he cuts off the tongues of the liars and hypocrites.'\n\nThere is also a tradition that the hypocrites of Madinah said: 'Had Muhammad been a prophet, he would not have died'; whereon O'mar, who had heard these words, drew his sword from the scabbard, took up his position at the door of the mosque, and exclaimed: 'I shall cut any man in twain who asserts that the apostle of God has departed from the perishable to the imperishable world.' When some professors of Isl\u00e2m heard these words of O'mar, doubts arose in their minds whether his lordship had died or not. On that occasion Asm\u00e2, the daughter of O'mys, placed her hands between the shoulders of the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014could not find the seal of prophecy, and exclaimed: 'Verily the lord of apostleship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014has taken leave of the perishable world, because the seal of prophecy has disappeared.' These words convinced many persons that this prince had departed from this world.\n\nIt is said that when his holy and prophetic lordship expired, Abu Bakr happened to be in his own house; but when he heard of the dreadful event he quickly departed, looked in the apartment of A'ayshah, and exclaimed: 'Alas for Muhammad! alas, he is dead!' He arrived weeping in the mosque of his lordship the refuge of termination, where he found the people in great distress. He looked at no one, but went to the house of A'ayshah, lifted the Redd from the blessed countenance of the apostle of God, and kissed some of the limbs of his lordship, saying: 'Thou art to me like a father; thou art sweet whether living or dead.' Then he left the sacred mansion, and beheld O'mar standing among the people and shouting: 'The apostle of God has not died.' Abu Bakr then requested O'mar to sit down, but ineffectually; therefore he exclaimed: 'O man, verily the prophet has expired. Knowest thou not that God the Most High, whose name be praised, has said in the glorious Qur\u00e2n, \"Verily thou wilt die, as they have died,\" and also, \"We have not created any human being immortal before\nthy time\u201d? Verily he has died, and they are immortal [in the next world].\u2019 After that Abu Bakr mounted the pulpit of the best of men; the people left O\u2019mar alone, and assembled around Abu Bakr, who first preached a sermon, commencing with the praises of God the Most High, and regret for the decease of the prince of existences. Then he said: \u2018Be it known to those who worshipped Muhammad that he is verily dead; and be it known to those who worship God that Allah is eternal, and dies not.\u2019 After these words he recited the blessed verse, \u2018Muhammad is but an apostle, who was preceded by other apostles; and if he dies or is killed, will ye retrace your steps?\u2019 till the end. He also repeated the verse, \u2018Verily thou [O Muhammad] wilt be dead, and they will be dead.\u2019 O\u2019mar says: \u2018I swear by Allah that I imagined I had not heard this verse ere it was uttered by Abu Bakr; I began to tremble, and fell to the ground.\u2019 It is related that after the sermon of Abu Bakr the people were convinced that the apostle of God had expired, and therefore they exclaimed: \u2018We belong to Allah, and to Him we shall surely return.\u2019 Then Abu Bakr endeavoured to console and to solace the members of the family, telling them that it was now their duty to wash, to shroud, to arrange, and to inter the body of his lordship. Then he hastened with O\u2019mar and with Abu O\u2019baydah Jurr\u00e2h to the Saqayfah of the Bani Saa\u2019d, because he had heard that the chief Anss\u00e2r had assembled there for the purpose of appointing a successor [to Muhammad], as will be related afterwards.\n\nThe Washing and Shrouding of his Lordship, and some other Matters.\n\nThe U\u2019lama of biographies\u2014Allah have mercy on them!\u2014narrate that when Abu Bakr went to the Saqayfah of the Bani Saa\u2019d, A\u2019bb\u00e2s\u2014u. w. b.\u2014ordered the door of the august apartment to be locked upon the people. When they were about to commence washing the corpse, the\n\n431 Qur\u00e2n, ch. iii. 138. 432 See footnote 428. 433 Temporary shed.\nmembers of the family heard a voice exclaim without the chamber: 'Do not wash him; he is pure, and needs no ablution.' After this voice, however, they heard another: 'Wash him; for the first speaker was Eblis\u2014the curse of God be on him!\u2014but I am Khizer.' After that A'li and A'bb\u00e2s, with Fadzl and Qatham, the sons of the latter, and As\u00e2mah B. Zayd, and Ss\u00e2leh, a manumitted slave of the lord of apostleship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014who was surnamed Shuqr\u00e2n, besides whom there were no other men in the apartment, suspended a curtain of striped Yemeni cloth, took up the corpse of that prince, and carried it behind this curtain. On that occasion there arose a difference of opinion among them whether they ought to wash the apostle in his clothes, or whether they ought to undress him and wash him, like any other corpse. While they were discussing this question the Omnipotent Sovereign sent upon them such a sleep that all drooped their chins on their breasts, and from a corner of the room the voice of an invisible herald uttered the words: 'Do not make the apostle of Allah naked, but wash him in his garments.' As the members of the family knew this to be an allocution from the other world, they rose and began to wash the corpse.\n\nW\u00e2qidy has a tradition that when A'bb\u00e2s ordered the door to be locked upon the people, the Anss\u00e2r shouted from without the apartment: 'O ye members of the family, we are the brothers of the apostle; our relationship, connection, and intimacy with the apostle in all religious matters is evident and known to everyone. It is our desire that one of us be present with you, that we be not excluded from participating in your attendance upon his lordship, and from the felicity connected therewith.' Some allege that Awus B. Khawly the Anss\u00e2ry exclaimed: 'O A'li, we adjure thee by God the Most High and Glorious to allow me to enter.' And, making allowance for the discrepancy of the two traditions, he was admitted to the place where the corpse of his holy and prophetic lordship underwent ablution; but no one was allowed to take part therein.\n\nIt has been ascertained as authentic that the corpse of\nhis lordship was laid down on his face, so that his blessed head was turned to the east. A\u2019li B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb\u2014u. b. w.\u2014commenced the operation by pressing his lordship to his bosom, and then taking a towel, which he introduced between the blessed body and the garment, whilst Fadzl was holding up the latter, and keeping it separate therefrom. A\u2019li the Commander of the Faithful then gently washed the propitious body, As\u00e2mah B. Zayd and Shuqr\u00e2n poured the water, and A\u2019bb\u00e2s with Qatham turned the sacred corpse from one side to the other, in which latter operation aid was offered also from the invisible world, so that only a slight effort was required to move the body from one hand to the other. A\u2019li\u2014u. b. w.\u2014not being able to see any dirt or impurity on the body of his lordship, as happens with other dead persons, he said: \u2018May my father and mother be a sacrifice for thee! What has perfumed thee in thy living and in thy dead condition?\u2019\n\nThere is a tradition that his lordship was first washed with pure water, then with water of the leaves of the lote-tree, and the third time with camphor-water. It is related that after the ablution had been completed, a few drops of water remained in the cavities of the eyes and in the navel of his lordship, which A\u2019li drank, and it became the cause of the increase of his knowledge and of his memory. The Em\u00e2m N\u00e2ttaq Ja\u2019fer-us-s\u00e2diq\u2014u. w. b.\u2014has a tradition that A\u2019li drank the water which was on the blessed body of the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and there is also a tradition that A\u2019li had seen an impurity in the eye of the apostle of God, and licked it out with his tongue. It is related that A\u2019li, having once been asked for the reason of his perfect memory, replied: \u2018When I washed the body of the apostle of God, and some water remained on his eyes, I could not find it in my heart to allow it to be spilled on the ground, so I licked it with my tongue, whereon my memory and knowledge became augmented.\u2019\n\nIn some biographical works it is related that a man asked Ebn A\u2019bb\u00e2s: \u2018How did you wash the prophet?\u2019 And he said: \u2018First they tied up a curtain of Yemen cloth,\nand this became afterwards a custom among us, as well as with many pious individuals. After that A\u2019bb\u00e1s ordered the Bani H\u0101shem to lock the door of the room, and they asked that one of the Anss\u0101r should be present in the place where his lordship was to be washed. Hereon Awus Bin Khawly, who had fought at Bedr, came in, and then A\u2019bb\u00e1s retired behind the curtain, where he called A\u2019li, Fadzl, Abu Sofy\u0101n B. Alh\u0101reth and As\u0101mah B. Zayd. After they had gone within, they, as well as those who had remained without the curtain, were overpowered by sleep, and drooped their heads. Then a voice from the invisible world was suddenly heard to exclaim: \u2018Do not wash the apostle of God, for he is pure;\u2019 but A\u2019bb\u00e1s said: \u2018Indeed we shall wash him.\u2019 The members of the family rejoined: \u2018We shall not wash him.\u2019 A\u2019bb\u00e1s, however, continued: \u2018For the sake of a voice, the speaker whereof we do not know, we shall not neglect the command of the prophet.\u2019 Accordingly A\u2019bb\u00e1s and A\u2019li approached the couch, and seated his lordship on the extremity of it. Then a voice from the invisible world was heard saying: \u2018Lay the apostle of God on his back and wash him.\u2019 After that both rose and placed his lordship so that his head was turned to the east, and his feet to the west. When they wished to turn his lordship from one side to the other, his propitious limbs moved immediately. His lordship had on his body a vest and a long shirt; his corpse was first washed with pure water, and then perfumed with camphor-water. Both the just-mentioned garments having been pressed, the propitious limbs of his lordship were rubbed with aromatic herbs, and after wrapping his body in a winding-sheet it was fumigated, taken from the place where it had been washed, and laid on a couch. After all this had been done, a voice was heard from the invisible world, saying: \u2018Dress your prophet, and God the Most High will dress you.\u2019 Therefore they put his clothes on him.\n\nAccording to a certain tradition, Ssiddyqah said: \u2018They wrapped the apostle of God in three white cloths, neither of which was either a shirt or a turban.\u2019 According to the\ntradition of A\u2019bb\u00e2s, the shroud of his lordship consisted of two pieces of white garments, and one of striped Yemen cloth; and the couch on which they laid the apostle belonged to Omm Solmah or to Omm Habyhah, which had been purchased for four thousand dirhems; and according to some later accounts that very couch is still in existence at Madinah. It is related that after washing and shrouding his lordship they placed him on the couch and left him alone for some time, that the angels might pray over him, as he had enjoined [in his life-time]. After that, crowds of Musalmans arrived, every one of whom said his prayers alone, without any one leading the devotions, because A\u2019li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had told the companions that in the funeral ceremonies no one should officiate as Em\u00e2m, saying: \u2018His lordship is your Em\u00e2m in life and in death.\u2019 And as some alleged that his lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014had himself issued these orders, certain persons were the cause of the procrastination of the interment.\n\nIn some traditions it is related that first A\u2019li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and A\u2019bb\u00e2s, with a number of intimate friends; then all the Moh\u00e2jer, with the Anss\u00e2r; and finally the women and children, prayed near the body. There is a tradition of A\u2019li, that on Tuesday, which was the second day after the demise of the apostle of God, he said: \u2018I heard a celestial herald uttering the words: \u201cFirst the crowds of the Musalmans are to pray for the prophet.\u201d\u2019 Biographers and historians relate that a difference of opinion arose among the companions where the apostle of God was to be buried. Some maintained that his noble tomb ought to be in his own house, while others proposed the mosque, and others the Baqyi\u2019 cemetery. Abu Bakr said: \u2018I have heard the apostle of God tell us that no prophet is to be buried in any other place than that wherein he expired.\u2019 According to a certain tradition, A\u2019li B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb said: \u2018On the face of the earth, no place is more acceptable to God the Most High than that where the spirit of the apostle of Allah was\ngrasped.' At any rate, they arrived at the conclusion to inter the sacred body of his lordship in the place whence his pure spirit took his departure to paradise.\n\nIt is related that there were two grave-diggers in Madinah, one Abu O'baydah Jurr\u00e2h, who used to make graves for the Moh\u00e2jer, by digging up the soil as a fissure, and this is called the medium size; the other was Abu Ttolhah the Anss\u00e2ry, who served the Anss\u00e2r with niche-graves. Each of the two just-mentioned sections desired the grave of his holy and prophetic lordship to be dug according to its own usage. A'bb\u00e2s sent for both the grave-diggers, and an arrangement was made that the one arriving first should dig the grave of his lordship the refuge of termination in his own way. On that occasion A'bb\u00e2s said: 'O God Most High, select the manner which is best for Thy prophet.' Of the two messengers who had been despatched, one could not find Abu O'baydah, but the other brought Abu Ttolhah, who was told to dig the grave like a niche,\\(^{434}\\) according to his own custom. According to a certain tradition, his lordship was, during the night of Wednesday, left on the edge of the grave, and was afterwards placed into the niche at the lower portion thereof:\n\nWhere art thou whose separation tears our hearts?\nOur distressed minds are in agony for thee.\nThou, the cypress of paradise, why under ground?\nThou, the source of life, why covered with earth?\n\nAccording to one tradition, A'bb\u00e2s, A'li B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb and Shuqr\u00e2n, but according to another Fadzl and Qatham, the sons of A'bb\u00e2s, and according to [yet] another A'bdu-r-rahman B. Awuf, stood at the grave of his holy and prophetic lordship, and Shuqr\u00e2n pushed Qottayfah, who had been present with his lordship at the conquest of Khayber, into the cavity of the grave, saying: 'I swear by Allah that no one but thyself shall cover up the grave.' And a number of religious persons have asserted that this had been done to fulfil one of the predictions of his lordship the prince of existences. There is a tradition that the last\n\n\\(^{434}\\) Lahd\u2014see the description of graves in my article 'Beliefs and Usages,' etc., Journal Bombay Br. R.A.S., vol. xii., p. 163.\nperson who came out from the grave of the apostle of God was A\u2019li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and another that it was Qatham, the son of A\u2019bb\u00e1s. The tradition, however, ascribed to Moghyrah B. Sha\u2019bah is that he said: \u2018I left my ring in the grave on purpose, and again entering when all had left, I took it out.\u2019 This tradition is weak and unfounded, because we read in some trustworthy books that when those words of Moghyrah were reported to A\u2019li, he said: \u2018Moghyrah had not the boldness to do any such thing.\u2019 In the Raudzatu-l-ahb\u0101b it is related that Moghyrah B. Sha\u2019bah had thrown his ring into the grave, which he entered on pretence of taking it out, and when he had touched the feet of that prince he came out and said: \u2018I am more closely connected with the apostle of God than you are.\u2019 Among critics, however, this tradition does not enjoy much credit.\n\nIt is related that after the intimate friends of his lordship the refuge of termination had come out of the grave, they threw earth on it. According to one tradition they left its top flat, but according to another they raised it. Then all the friends went away and entered the house of Fattimah Zohr\u0101, where they went through the ceremonies of condolence. The favourite daughter of the apostle of God asked them: \u2018Have you buried the prophet?\u2019 They replied: \u2018Yes.\u2019 She asked: \u2018How could you find it in your hearts to throw earth on his lordship? Was he not the prophet of the Merciful [God]?\u2019 They replied: \u2018O daughter of the apostle of God, we are also grieved and distressed, but we cannot avoid obeying the commands of God the Most High.\u2019\n\nIn the Maqssad Aqssa it is related that when the apostle of God was interred in the house of A\u2019ayshah and the burning lamp was extinguished by the storm of time, Fattimah Zohr\u0101 remained in the place, weeping day and night. She was being consumed, like a candle, by the fire of her own heart, looked now and then at Hasan and Husayn, lamenting so violently over her own dereliction and the hopeless state of her children, that she increased\nthe fire of her own heart, the people wept tears of blood,\nthe friends and companions all weeping with them, addressing\nthe lord of human beings and cream of existences in\nthe following strains:\n\nO lord, what hast thou seen of these broken hearts\nThat, leaving us, thou reposedest in another place?\nWe knew not thy value, O shadow of God!\nTherefore thou withdrawest thy shadow from our heads.\nAs this narrow world had not suited thee,\nThou hast selected thy place near the throne of God;\nThou hast met Him without a leader,\nWithout a mediator thou hast reached His exalted presence!\nThou art the bird of the sacred nest. No wonder\nThou flewest from this cage again to the rose-garden.\nSend us a perfume from the rose of hope,\nOf the perfume thou hast inhaled in paradise;\nPour one drop into our thirsty palates\nOf the pure wine thou hast tasted of the truth.\n\nIn the Kit\u00e1b Dall\u00e1ylu-n-nabawwat it is recorded that when\nhis holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014departed from\nthe perishable to the imperishable world, the daylight\nvanished, so that the people could not see each other, nor\neven the palms of their hands before their eyes, until the\ntime when the interment had been completed. After that,\nAbu Bakr and several daughters of A'bdu-l-muttalleb,\nwho were the paternal aunts of the apostle of God, recited\nthrenodies, during which some comforted Fattimah Zohr\u00e1\n\u2014u. w. b.\u2014but others, weeping and lamenting, did not\ninterfere with her distress and impatience. The author of\nthese pages says that in the biographies of the members of\nthe family and of the companions, innumerable threnodies\nbewailing the death of the apostle of God occur in verses,\nbut for fear of incurring the charge of prolixity he inserts\nonly the following three distichs uttered by Fattimah:\n\nWhen my grief increases I visit thy tomb weeping,\nI lament and cry; shall I receive thy answer?\nO tenant of the grave, hast thou taught me to weep?\nWilt not thy memory overwhelm all other griefs?\nI was on the grave, absent from myself,\nBut I was not absent from my burning heart!\n\nThe benediction of Allah be on him, on his descendants,\nfriends; and companions who followed him. Salutations\nto them all.\nVarious Other Events.\n\nIt is the opinion of most biographers that the apostle of God expired on Monday, the 12th of the month Rabyi' anterior; some, however, assert that this great calamity took place on the 2nd of the said month. Ssiddyqah says: 'We knew not that the apostle of God had been buried, until we heard on the morning of Tuesday the noise made by the spades while the grave was being filled up with earth.' The Em\u00e2n Ja'fer Ss\u00e2diq has, however, a tradition from his father, according to which the interment of his lordship took place during the night of Wednesday. There is a statement of Ebn A'bb\u00e2s that the prophet was born on a Monday, entered Madinah on a Monday, died on a Monday, and that the black stone was uplifted on a Monday. Two causes have been assigned for the delay of the burial of his lordship. The first was the difference of opinion whether his blessed body ought to be interred in Madinah or to be conveyed to Mekkah; and the second was that, after the first grave had been dug, a discussion arose, whether his lordship ought to be buried in the Baqy\u00ee cemetery, or in his mosque, or in his own apartment. The opinion, however, of the Shia'hs, that the interment was delayed because all the Moh\u00e2jer and Anss\u00e2r were engaged in appointing a successor [to the prophet], is rejected by the Sunnis.\n\nAnus B. M\u00e1lek has a tradition that 'on the day when the apostle of God removed [or rather fled] from Mekkah to Madinah, the whole city was shining with light, but that on the day when he departed to the eternal world that glorious region became darkened and obscured, and we had not yet washed off the earth of the prophet's grave from our hands, when these two ideas occurred to us.' His lordship died in a coarse blanket, and Abu Burdah says that A'ayshah took it, as well as a heavy Iz\u00e2r out of the house, saying: 'The apostle of God has died in both these things.' Omm Solmah says: 'On the day when the apostle expired I placed on his blessed breast my hand,\nwhich thereon began to exhale the odour of musk. I used to eat with my hand, and washed it, but the fragrance of musk, nevertheless, adhered to it for several weeks.'\n\nIt is the general opinion that his holy and prophetic lordship lived sixty-three years, and that after forty years of his precious life had elapsed, he was raised to the high dignity of prophecy. After he had, during thirteen years, exhorted the people to adopt the orthodox religion, he departed [i.e., fled] from Mekkah to Madinah, where he remained ten years, promulged the revelation of God and preached the commandments of the noble religion, as has been recorded in these pages by way of abridgment. Should, however, life be granted to the author to complete the present work, and his exalted patron\u2014may he sit on the throne of dignity and glory till the end of the world\u2014agrees, the author would compose a separate and detailed biography of his holy and prophetic lordship, if it pleaseth Allah the Most High. At present, however, the unworthy writer will narrate the adventure of Moa'adh B. Jabal, which is not void of interest and attraction. Thereon he will give a slight notice of the miracles of the prince of existences, and after that he will begin to describe the reigns of the divinely-guided Khalifahs and later Em\u00e2ms. Allah grants favours, and in Him we trust.\n\nMOA\u2019ADH B. JABAL GOES TO THE COUNTRY OF YEMEN AND RETURNS AGAIN.\n\nThe U\u2019lam\u00e2 who wrote biographies\u2014Allah have mercy on them\u2014relate that after the decease of B\u00e2d\u00e2n, the Governor of Yemen, the apostle of God, having one day terminated the matutinal prayers, turned his blessed face towards his companions, and said: \u2018O ye Moh\u00e2jer and Anss\u00e2r, who of you is willing to go to Yemen?\u2019 Abu Bakr rose, and said: \u2018O apostle of God, may my father and mother be a sacrifice for thee! I am ready to go.\u2019 His lordship, however, replied nothing. After awhile the apostle repeated the same words; and O\u2019mar rose, saying:\n\n435 A\u2019li Shir, the Amir of Herat.\n'O apostle of God, I shall go!' But his lordship said neither yea nor nay. When he had uttered the words for the third time, Moa'adh B. Jabal rose, and said: 'If thou wilt allow, I shall do this business. May my father and mother be a sacrifice for thee, as well as my own life, O apostle of God!' To these words of Moa'adh, his lordship the refuge of termination replied: 'Yes; thou art fit for the business, and the business is fit for thee.' Then he said: 'Ball\u00e2l, bring my turban.' Ball\u00e2l obeyed, and his lordship placed the blessed turban with his own blessed hands on the head of Moa'adh, and, having mounted him on a camel, he proceeded with the Anss\u00e2r and the Moh\u00e2jer, all of whom were on foot, in the company of Moa'adh, his lordship walking by the side of the latter, and imparting to him his instructions. On that occasion Moa'adh said: 'O apostle of God, I am mounted and thou art on foot; wilt thou allow me to alight and to walk with thy companions?' But the prophet replied: 'I believe I am walking on the business of God the Most High, O Moa'adh. I enjoin thee to be pious, of veracious speech and righteous dealing. I command thee to surrender anything which may be deposited with thee, to avoid fraud, to be kind, to abstain from everything illicit, to perform all duties, to give alms to the poor, to be of fair address, and to be forward in saluting the people. Be afraid of the day of reckoning and of requital, and prefer the blessings of the next to the goods of the present world. O Moa'adh, insult no Musalm\u00e2n, believe no liar, disbelieve no veracious person, and disobey no righteous superior. O Moa'adh, whatever good I covet for myself, that I covet for thee; and whatever evil I desire to avoid, I wish thee to escape from likewise. O Moa'adh, visit the sick, and quickly relieve widows and destitute women. Be familiar with orphans, associate with poor persons, and prefer the interests of others to thy own. Step not out from the circle of righteousness, and let no insult of any man which he utters for the sake of truth offend thee. O Moa'adh, were another meeting after this possible between thee and me, I would certainly have cut\nshort my admonitions, but we shall see each other no more till the day of the resurrection.\n\nIt is easy to separate and meet again;\nBut we separate; and where do we meet again?\n\nAfter Moa'adh had listened to these words of his holy and prophetic lordship, he began to weep, so that from the fire in his heart the smoke of melancholy ascended into his brains. He took leave of that prince with a grieved heart and sorrowful mind, departed to Yemen, and arrived, after performing the journey, in Ssana'a, which is the capital of that country. There the people hastened to wait on him; he mounted the pulpit, and delivered an address beginning with the praises of the Almighty Creator, and salutations to the elected Ahmad\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and ending with the promulgation of the treaty of the apostle of God. After he had terminated this business, the nobles and chiefs said to him: 'We have prepared a repast for thee, as well as a lodging, with carpets and beds suited to thy dignity and position, and request thee to take possession.' But Moa'adh replied: 'O ye nobles of Ssana'a, God forbid that I should do so. For the favourite of Allah has sent me to visit the sick, to relieve the distress of widows and sick persons, to call on orphans, to associate with the poor and destitute, and to prefer the interests of justice to my own; to promulge the truth to the people, and not to take notice of the insults of anyone when I am preaching the commands of God.' After that Moa'adh selected a corner [of a room] for his lodging, obtained imperishable nourishment by his pursuits, and attended to the government of that country until he heard one night the following words in a dream: 'O Moa'adh, thou art on the couch of repose, whereas Muhammad, the apostle of God, is in the agony of death!' He therefore leapt up weeping, and thought that perhaps the morn of the day of resurrection had dawned. When, however, he looked at the firmament with its twinkling stars in its usual condition, he thought that the words he had just heard originated either from his own hallucination or from machinations of Satan; he therefore exclaimed:\n'I take refuge with God from Satan, driven away with stones.' During the following night he heard the words, 'O Moa'adh, how canst thou enjoy life whilst Muhammad the apostle of God is underground?' Moa'adh jumped up from sleep, began to weep and to moan aloud, exclaiming: 'Alas for Muhammad!' He shouted so violently that the people awoke, came out of their houses and gathered around him, saying: 'Moa'adh, what is the matter with thee? What news hast thou received this night that thou lamentest so much?' Moa'adh nevertheless continued to cry and to moan till morning, whereon he mounted his camel, saying: 'During this journey I shall not alight, except to pray or to answer a call of nature.' While he was travelling in the night, and only three farsakhs more remained till Madinah, he heard the following words on his left side: 'O Allah, inform Moa'adh that Muhammad has tasted the beverage of death, and has departed from this world.' Moa'adh replied: 'O thou who speakest to me in this dark night, who art thou?' The voice replied: 'I am O'mm\u0101r Y\u0101ser.' He asked: 'Where art thou going?' Y\u0101ser replied: 'To Yemen. And I am bearing the letter wherein Abu Bakr informs Moa'adh that Muhammad the apostle of God has joined the mercy of the Lord of both worlds:\n\nThat vault of prophecy has sunk,\nThat castle of apostleship is ruined,\nThat city of mercy is destroyed,\nThat Nile of grandeur has become a mirage.\n\nMoa'adh began to cry and to lament, saying, 'O support and refuge of the professors of the religion, O last of the apostles,\n\nTo whom will the unhappy now apply?\nFrom whom will the poor now ask aid?\n\nMoa'adh also said: 'O'mm\u0101r, I adjure thee by our connection with Muhammad, tell me in what state thou hast left the companions of the apostle.' He replied: 'Like a flock without a shepherd.' Moa'adh continued: 'How hast thou left Madinah?' O'mm\u0101r said: 'I left it at a time when that city pressed more closely on its inhabitants than a ring on the finger.' Moa'adh placed his hand on his\nhead, and exclaimed: 'Alas for Muhammad!' He continued his lamentations till he reached the neighbourhood of Madinah, where an old woman pasturing sheep heard his exclamations, and said: 'Thou servant of God, I have not beheld Muhammad, but I have seen his daughter Fattimah Zohr\u00e2 weeping for her father, and saying: \"Alas, my father! the Divine revelations which were received have ceased. O my father, no heavenly message will be sent to us hereafter.\" And I have seen A'li the Commander of the Faithful, who wept, and said: \"O thou refuge and patron of widows and orphans, who will now relieve the former and console the latter?\" I also saw Hasan and Husayn weep and say: \"O possessor of both worlds, how hast Thou withdrawn Thy favour from us! To whose care, trust, and mercy hast Thou recommended us?\"'\n\nWhen Moa'adh had heard these words he shed rubies and pearls [of tears] from his bloodshot eyes, and poured bright jewels on the dust of the road. On the night during which he arrived in Madinah, he first went to the door of Ssiddyqah's house and knocked. She exclaimed: 'Who is that who knocks at midnight on a widow's door?' Moa'adh replied: 'It is me, the servant of the apostle of God, Moa'adh B. Jabal.' A'ayshah then ordered a slave-girl to open the door; Moa'adh entered weeping, and uttered a salutation, after returning which A'ayshah said: 'Moa'adh, knowest thou that my beloved father\\(^{436}\\) has departed from the perishable to the imperishable world?' After A'ayshah had expressed other sentiments of the same kind, both wept much, and Moa'adh said: 'O mother of the Faithful, tell me about the sickness of the apostle of God.' A'ayshah said: 'O Moa'adh, being unable to endure the sight of the sufferings of the apostle of God, I sometimes absented myself from his bedside. Thou must ask this question from Fattimah Zohr\u00e2, who has attended on his lordship from the beginning of his malady till his last breath. Accordingly Moa'adh left the house of A'ayshah and went to that of Fattimah. When he knocked at the door, A'li\n\n\\(^{436}\\) This stands for husband, as a term of respect.\nthe Commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014asked: \u2018Who is coming here at so unseasonable an hour of the night?\u2019 Moa\u2019adh replied: \u2018I, the slave of the threshold, the slave of this sublime court, the attendant on the apostle of God; I, the servant of God the Most High, Moa\u2019adh B. Jabal.\u2019 When Fattimah recognised the voice of Moa\u2019adh, she ordered the Em\u00e0m Hasan to open the door. Then Moa\u2019adh entered, condoled with Fattimah\u2014u. w. b.\u2014and asked her: \u2018How was the prophet when the disease overwhelmed him, and what was the condition of the prince at that time?\u2019 Fattimah replied: \u2018O Moa\u2019adh, hadst thou seen the lord of existences in the agony of death, when the hue of his countenance, endued with laudable qualities, became sometimes red and sometimes yellow, and when he occasionally glanced to the left, or fixed his eyes on the sky, saying, \u201cA\u2019li, convey my salutations to my friends,\u201d life would not be sweet to thee any more. O Moa\u2019adh, on that occasion I was attending upon and nursing the apostle of God, sitting at his bedside, when a man suddenly appeared near the door, and said: \u201cGreeting to you, ye members of the house of prophecy. Salutation to you, ye mine of apostleship and of kindness. Will you allow me to enter the house?\u201d I replied: \u201cO servant of God, may the Lord of both worlds reward thee for visiting the sick, but the apostle of God cannot see anyone at present.\u201d The angel of death then shouted to me: \u201cFattimah, do not oppose me, for I must enter!\u201d Then the pain of that prince decreased, he opened his eyes, and said: \u201cO Fattimah, knowest thou whom thou art conversing with? He is the destroyer of the enjoyments of the servants of God, the maker of widows and orphans. He asks no one for permission, he enters every house, and returns not until he has taken a life. He is called the grasper of souls and angel of death. Fattimah, allow him to enter.\u201d When the angel of death had obtained permission, he entered, and said: \u201cSalutation to thee, O apostle of God!\u201d and his lordship replied: \u201cSalutation to thee, O faithful servant of God!\u201d \u201cI swear by that God who has\nsent thee in reality, that ere this I have never entered the house of any prophet and asked for admittance, nor shall I ask for permission from anyone after thee.\u201d His lordship asked: \u201cHast thou come to take my soul?\u201d He replied: \u201cYes, such is the command of my Creator.\u201d His lordship continued: \u201cI have a request.\u201d The angel of death asked: \u201cWhat is it?\u201d The apostle of God said: \u201cGive me respite till my friend Jebr\u00e2il arrives, that I may ask him something.\u201d A\u2019zrayil replied: \u201cI swear by that God who has sent thee to be an apostle and a mercy that I was despatched to thy threshold with orders not to overstep it until permitted, and not to engage in the taking of thy soul until allowed by thee to do so.\u201d Then the angel of death left the apostle of God\u2014u. w. b.\u2014but met at the door of the house Jebr\u00e2il and Myk\u00e2yl, each of whom was accompanied by one thousand angels, who had also brought a shroud and aromatic plants from paradise. Jebr\u00e2il, perceiving the angel of death, asked him: \u201cA\u2019zrayil, what hast thou done to my friend? Hast thou been engaged in taking his soul or not?\u201d A\u2019zrayil replied: \u201cMuhammad asked me for a respite until he should see thee, and ask some questions.\u201d Jebr\u00e2il wept, and said: \u201cO angel of death, return; perceivest thou not that the portals of heaven are opened, that the angels are congratulating each other at the approach of Muhammad\u2019s spirit, that paradise is adorned, and that the H\u00fbris with large eyes have put on their decorations and ornaments, rejoicing as they are at the advent of the soul of Muhammad?\u201d Jebr\u00e2il then entered the noble apartment with the angel of death, and said: \u201cSalutation to thee, O apostle of God! May God bless thee and thy family! The Lord of Magnificence sends thee greeting!\u201d His lordship replied: \u201cHe is peace. Peace cometh from Him and returneth to Him. Salutation to thee! The peace, mercy, and blessing of God be with thee, O my friend! The angel of death has come to take my soul. Hast thou any good news to give me?\u201d Jebr\u00e2il replied: \u201cO Muhammad, rejoice! I swear by that God who has in reality sent thee as a mercy to the human race,\nthat when I came the portals of heaven were opened, the angels congratulated each other on the coming of thy soul. I have seen the highest paradise adorned, and the H\u00fbris with large eyes in ecstasies of joy for thy impending arrival.\u201d His holy and prophetic lordship replied: \u201cI do not ask about these matters, O Jebrail. Give me tidings that will comfort my mind.\u201d Jebrail continued: \u201cO Muhammad, the keys of paradise will be in thy hand, and no one shall enter it before thee.\u201d He rejoined: \u201cI do not ask about this.\u201d Jebr\u00e2il continued: \u201cOn the morn of the resurrection the banner of Muhammad will be in thy hand; under it will be Adam, with all his descendants, uttering the words: \u2018There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is the apostle of Allah.\u2019 He continued: \u201cThis is not what I want to know.\u201d Then Jebr\u00e2il began to weep, and said: \u201cDear friend, what, then, wastest thou to know? And what glad tidings askest thou?\u201d The prophet said: \u201cI grieve for the poor and weak professors of our religion, for whom I have laboured so much, and I desire to know who will take care of them when I am gone, and what their condition will be?\u201d Jebr\u00e2il replied: \u201cNone of the prophets and apostles can enter paradise before thee, and, in like manner, no nation can enter it before thy people have entered. This is on account of the honour in which God the Most High holds thee, and for the sake of the love which thou bearest towards thy adherents they will obtain favour and mercy.\u201d His lordship replied: \u201cO Jebr\u00e2il, now is my soul refreshed and my spirit rejoiced, because of the glad tidings thou hast communicated to me.\u201d Then he said: \u201cO angel of death, come forward and execute what thou hast been ordered.\u201d When the angel of death approached, his prophetic lordship said to Jebr\u00e2il: \u201cO my beloved, leavest thou me alone? Pray to God the Most High and Glorious that the last agony of death may be easy to me.\u201d\n\nFattimah Zohr\u00e2\u2014u. w. b.\u2014said: \u2018On that occasion I heard a voice uttering the following words: \u201cI am present, I am present! O my friend, rejoice, for thou wilt enter our paradise!\u201d Hereon perspiration more fragrant than\nmusk trickled down the forehead of his lordship, and I heard a melody the like of which I had never heard before in my life, nor did I perceive any change in the intellect of the apostle of God even till his last breath.' The writer of these pages says that although he entertained some doubts about the story of Moa'adh B. Jabal, he has nevertheless inserted it in this place for the sake of greater perspicuity.\n\nSome of the Miracles and [Fulfilments of some] Prayers of his Lordship.\n\nMuhammad E. Esah\u00e2q has a tradition that after Abu-l-a\u2019ass B. Rabyi\u2019 B. A\u2019bd\u00fb-l-u\u2019zza B. Shams, who was the son of the sister of Khodayjah, the daughter of Khowylad, had married her daughter Zaynab, whom she begat with the apostle of God, and also after Raqyah, the step-sister of Zaynab, had been married to O\u2019tbah B. Abu Lahab, a feud had broken out between the Qoraish and the apostle of God, in consequence whereof the flames of envy and rancour had commenced to blaze in the furnaces of their minds. Wishing to distress and to insult that prince, some of the Qoraish said to Abu-l-a\u2019ass and to O\u2019tbah: \u2018Both of you have wedded daughters of Muhammad, and have thereby relieved him of the trouble to take care of them. Now you must divorce his daughters in order to cause him grief and unhappiness; and we shall give you instead of them any of the daughters of Qoraish chieftains whom you may select.\u2019 Abu-l-a\u2019ass replied: \u2018I swear by God that I shall never separate from my wife, nor prefer any other woman to her.\u2019 O\u2019tbah the licentious\u2014curses be on him\u2014however, said: \u2018If you try to procure for me the daughter of Sa\u2019yd Abu-l-a\u2019ass I shall divorce the daughter of Muhammad.\u2019 Accordingly the Qoraish married the daughter of Sa\u2019yd to O\u2019tbah, although at that time he had not yet had any true connection with Raqyah.\u2019 U\u2019rwah B. Azzobayr says: \u2018O\u2019tbah came to the apostle of God, and spoke the following words: \u201cThis son-in-law [of thine] does not believe in the crazy star which has come down,\nand does not acknowledge that Jebrail is visiting thee.\" Then he squirted the saliva of his impure mouth towards his lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014divorced Raqyah, uttered a few more unbecoming words, and departed.'\n\nDistich: The moon sheds light, the dog barks;\nIt is not the moon's fault, but the dog's nature.\n\nIt is related that on the occasion when O'tbah\u2014curses on him\u2014perpetrated the above act, the apostle of God\u2014u. w. b.\u2014pronounced the following invocation: 'O God, appoint over him one of Thy dogs.' Abu Tt\u00e2leb, who was present with the apostle of God, said to O'tbah: 'O my nephew, what stratagem can save thee from the sequel of this prayer?' According to another tradition, Abu Tt\u00e2leb, being grieved at his lordship's wish, said to the prophet: 'Son of my brother, what wilt thou gain by this evil wish?' In short, O'tbah returned to his house and communicated to his father, Abu Lahab, what had taken place; but the latter was, despite his idolatry and obstinacy, convinced that the wish of his lordship, the best of the servants of God, would be responded to, and was grieved. Some time afterwards, Abu Lahab and O'tbah departed with a company of the Qoraish to Syria for the purpose of trading. During their journey, however, they halted in a station where a monk informed them that many wild beasts were on the road, and advised them to be very careful. On that occasion Abu Lahab turned to his companions, and said: 'Be prepared for a contest and aid each other, for I am not sure whether the imprecation of Muhammad will not be responded to.' Afterwards they heaped together all their baggage, and the couch of O'tbah happened to be on the top of it. When the night set in, O'tbah reclined on his couch, and the whole caravan reposed around the property of O'tbah. In the middle of the night, however, a roaring lion attacked the people of the caravan, all of whom were sleeping near their baggage; he snuffed at every person, but injured no one until he mounted the heap of merchandise where O'tbah slept, and sent that impudent\nwretch to hell by ripping up his abdomen, thus making him a loser in this and in the next world.\n\nIt is related that when Abu T\u00e1lab happened, on a certain occasion, to be sick, his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014condescended to pay him a visit, during which he requested the apostle to pray that the Most High would grant him health. That prince accordingly turned to the Qiblah of prayer, and said: \u2018O God, heal my uncle, Abu T\u00e1lab.\u2019 Whereon the latter, having immediately been cured of his disease, said: \u2018O Muhammad, the Creator whom thou worshippest responds indeed to thy requests.\u2019 The Sunnis allege that the apostle of God replied to these words with his wonderfully eloquent tongue as follows: \u2018Uncle, if thou wilt also worship Him, He will grant thy prayers likewise.\u2019\n\nThere is a tradition that a woman had a son, who was so sick that he had not a single hair left on his head; therefore she took the little boy to the apostle of God, and requested him to pray to God that he might recover his health. His lordship complied with the request of the poor woman, placed his hands on the head of the little boy and uttered a prayer, whereon the hair immediately sprouted on his head, and he was cured of his disease. At the time when Moseylamah the liar claimed to be a prophet, a woman brought her sick boy to him, and requested him to pray for his recovery. Moseylamah placed his hands on the head of the child, but by the touch of his unhallowed hand the little boy lost every hair of his head.\n\nIt is related of A\u2019li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014u. w. b.\u2014that he said: \u2018On a certain occasion I was attending on the apostle of God, when a number of the Qoraish approached him, and said: \u201cMuhammad, the pretensions made by thee are greater than any ever broached by thy ancestors; but if thou canst show them to be true, we shall acknowledge thee to be a prophet; if not, we shall set thee down as a wizard and liar.\u201d His lordship asked: \u201cWhat is your wish?\u201d They continued: \u201cCall out to this tree that it come out from the earth with its roots.\u201d They\nthen pointed out a tree in the vicinity, and the apostle of God said: \"Allah is omnipotent! If He does this thing, will you believe in His unity?\" The idolaters having replied in the affirmative, his lordship continued: \"I shall show you what you ask, although I know that there is no good in you, and I know him who instigated you, namely, Abu Jahl. He also is among you, who will make a league against me, namely, Abu Sofy\u00e2n B. Harb.\" Then he exclaimed: \"O tree, if thou believest in Allah the Most High and Glorious, and in the day of requital, and if thou knowest me to be the apostle of God, arise from the earth with all thy roots and stand near me by the permission of God the Most High, whose name be blessed and exalted!\" A'li continued: 'I swear by that God who has in reality sent Muhammad to mankind, that the tree came out of the earth with its roots, approached the apostle of God\u2014u. w. b.\u2014uttered a great shout, and shook itself like the wings of a bird, moving until it reached the prophet, near whom it remained stationary and overshadowed him with its two highest branches. Some of these also touched my back while I was standing at the right hand of his lordship. When the idolaters saw what was taking place, they said: \"O Muhammad, order one half of the tree to remain with thee, and the other to return to its former place.\" His holy and prophetic lordship thereon made a sign to the tree, and one half of it remained, while the other returned to its former place. They then again requested him to move the stationary portion to its original place, and to bring the other again back therefrom, which he likewise did, and I exclaimed: \"There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is the apostle of Allah. I am thy first adherent, O apostle of Allah, and I believe whatever the tree has done was by command of God the Most High to demonstrate the truth of thy prophetship.\" After I had uttered these words, the Qoraish exclaimed: \"Muhammad is a sorcerer, a liar, a juggler, and a wizard, and no one will believe him except such a fellow,\" meaning myself.'\n\nSee 'The Confederates,' Qur\u00e2\u0144, ch. xxxiii.\nThere is a tradition that once some persons came to the apostle of God, complained that their water was brackish, and said: 'The sweet water is distant from us.' Accordingly his lordship rose, and went with a number of his companions to the well, into which he threw some saliva from his blessed mouth, whereon the water immediately became sweet. The well is celebrated to this day, and was inherited by the members of that tribe from generation to generation, the people still boasting of the miracle worked in their favour. When the people of Moseylamah the liar had heard of this miracle, they requested him to work a similar one in their favour, but as soon as Moseylamah had thrown the saliva from his accursed mouth into their well, the water became brackish, and had the taste of the urine of an ass.\n\nIn some books it is recorded that several persons came to his lordship the refuge of apostleship, to complain of the paucity of water in their well. Accordingly his lordship spat into it, and the water rose as high as they wished. During the time of Moseylamah, some of his people who had heard of this miracle made the same request to him, and said: 'Muhammad has done such a thing, and we beseech thee in the same manner to spit into our well, for the increase of the water thereof.' Moseylamah complied with their petition, and when he squirted the water of his impure mouth into the well, the little water which was in it disappeared altogether, and the well became so dry that not a drop remained therein.\n\nIt is related that when his holy and prophetic lordship returned to Madinah from the Ghazwah of the Bani Tha'lebah, a camel one day approached him, and he asked his companions: 'Know you what this camel says?' J\u00e2ber the Anss\u00e2ry\u2014u. w. b.\u2014replied: 'Allah and His prophet know best.' His lordship then said: 'This camel speaks as follows: \"My owner has made me work till I have become old, and my back is sore. Now he wants to slay me and sell my flesh.\" ' His lordship continued: 'Go with this camel to its owner and bring him to me.'\nJ\u00e2ber replied: 'I swear by God that I do not know the master of it.' His lordship said: 'I will show thee the way.' J\u00e2ber continues: 'I went with the camel till I arrived among the Bani Hanttalah, and inquired for the owner of the camel. One of them replied that he owned it. I then said that the apostle of God had despatched me in search of him, whereon he accompanied me, and we brought the camel to his lordship, who said to its owner: \"Thy camel says so and so.\" He replied: \"The words of the camel are true, O apostle of God.\" His lordship continued: \"Sell it to me.\" The man said: \"I make thee a present of it.\" His lordship would not agree, but purchased the camel from him, and whenever any one of us wanted to go to a near place, he mounted that camel with the permission of his lordship the refuge of termination.' J\u00e2ber continues: 'A short time afterwards I perceived that the wound of the camel had disappeared, and that it had recovered its health.'\n\nThere is a tradition of A\u2019li the Commander of the Faithful, of Ebn A\u2019bb\u00e2s, of Ebn Masu\u2019d, and of other noble companions\u2014may Allah reward them all\u2014that once the Qoraish idolaters assembled around the apostle of God, and said: 'If thy claim to prophecy be true, then divide the moon in twain.' His lordship the refuge of termination\u2014u. w. b.\u2014said: 'Will you believe if I do it?' They said: 'Yes.' Then he pointed his finger at the moon, and it was immediately divided into two parts, one of which remained in its place and the other was concealed behind a mountain. His holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014then exclaimed: 'O such and such a one, and such and such a one, be ye witnesses.' According to another tradition the moon was divided in such a manner that Mount Hira intervened between the two halves. Some idolaters then said: 'Muhammad has bewitched you,' and others exclaimed: 'What we have seen cannot possibly have been perceived by all the people; we must therefore ask travellers, and if they also have witnessed this strange\nphenomenon, you may be sure that Muhammad is a true prophet, but if not, not.' Accordingly when strangers and travellers arrived from various regions in Mekkah, the unbelievers and hypocrites examined them, and received the information that on a certain night the moon appeared divided into two halves.\n\nIt is related that an Arab who was a huntsman had caught a land-crocodile,\\(^{438}\\) which he was carrying to his house as food for his family and children. While he was on the way, he suddenly perceived a large gathering of people and asked for the cause of it. The people replied: 'Muhammad, the son of A'bdullah\u2014the bl. of A. be on him and on his family\u2014is here and claims to be a prophet.' The Arab forcibly entered the crowd, went up to his lordship, and said: 'O Muhammad, I shall not believe thee until this crocodile believes,' and threw the land-crocodile at his lordship's feet; but it wanted to run away; therefore his holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014exclaimed: 'Lizard, approach.' The animal obeyed, replying in eloquent and distinct language: 'I await thy commands with pleasure.' His lordship asked: 'Whom worshippest thou?' The animal replied: 'I worship Allah, whose throne is in heaven, whose dominion is on earth, whose power is in the sea, whose mercy is in paradise, and whose punishment is in hell.' The apostle of God asked: 'Who am I?' The animal said: 'Thou art the apostle of the Lord of both worlds and the seal of prophets; blessings be on thee! Whoever believes thee will be saved, and whoever accuses thee of falsehood will be damned.' When the huntsman heard these words of the crocodile he took the finger of astonishment between the teeth of meditation, and said 'After this I wish for no other proof of thy veracity. I testify that there is no God but Allah, and I testify that thou art His servant and His apostle. This profession I now make externally and internally. I swear by God that when I first approached thee, there was no man on the\n\n\\(^{438}\\) No doubt only a big lizard is meant.\nface of the earth whom I hated more than thee; now, however, I love thee more than my own eyes, ears, father, mother, and children.' His holy and prophetic lordship\u2014u. w. b.\u2014replied: 'Thanks and praises be to Allah, who has shown thee the right way.'\n\nThere is a tradition of Ebn O'mar that he said: 'We were on a journey with the apostle of God, when an Arab met us, whom that prince asked: \"Where art thou going?\" He replied: \"To my house.\" The prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014continued: \"Wilt thou utter two phrases?\" The Arab asked: \"What are they?\" His lordship continued: \"Say: There is no God but Allah only, who has no partner, and Muhammad is His servant and apostle.\" The Arab asked: \"Who is a witness to the truth of thy claim?\" The prophet replied: \"This tree which is standing on the edge of the Wady.\" After the apostle had uttered these words, the tree began to move from the place, tearing up the ground while it moved towards the prophet, near whom it finally stopped. Then his lordship asked the tree thrice, and the tree bore thrice witness to the truth of the claim of his holy and prophetic lordship.' Borydah relates that the Arab asked for a miracle from his holy and prophetic lordship, who replied: 'Say to that tree, The apostle of God is calling thee.' The Arab obeyed, the tree inclined from one side to the other until it extricated its roots from the soil, and then, moving up to the prophet, said: 'Salutation to thee, O prophet of God.' The Arab continued: 'Order the tree to return to its place.' Accordingly the tree returned by the permission of his lordship the refuge of termination again to its former place, where it remained standing. Then the Arab said: 'Allow me to worship thee.' But his lordship replied: 'Were I to allow created beings to be worshipped, I would order wives to adore their husbands.'\n\nIt is related of Abu Dharr Ghuff\u0101r\u012b that the apostle of God was sitting in a certain place, and that Abu Bakr, O'mar and O'thman were attending on him. His lordship\ntook up seven pebbles from the ground, and when he placed them on the blessed palm of his hand, they began to praise God, and their voice resembled the humming of bees. When he threw the pebbles on the ground they became silent. The Sunnis believe that the gravel uttered praises of God also when successively placed into the hands of Abu Bakr, O'mar and O'thm\u00e2n. In the Tamhyd of Abu Shukr and of Abu S\u00e2lem\u00ee it is recorded that A'li was likewise present in that assembly, and that when his lordship placed the pebbles into the hands of A'li they likewise praised God in the following words: 'Praise be to God, and laudation to God.' After that Abu Dharr took the gravel, by order of the prophet, into his own hand, but it gave forth no sound. Abu Dharr then asked: 'What mystery is it that the pebbles utter praises in their hands, but are silent in mine?' His holy and prophetic lordship however replied: 'Because thou wantest to be their equal.'\n\nThere is a tradition that Abu Jahl had bought a camel from a man, but as he delayed payment the seller applied to the assembly of the Qoraish, who, however, replied by way of derision: 'Tell Muhammad to take from Abu-l-hukm\\(^{439}\\) what is due to thee.' Accordingly the seller went to the apostle of God, represented his case, and requested his aid. His lordship complied, went with the man to the house of Abu Jahl, and knocked at the door, whereon he came out quite confused, and said: 'Welcome, O father of Q\u00e2sim; what is the reason of thy condescension?' That prince replied: 'Pay this man what thou owest.' Abu Jahl continued: 'I hear and obey,' and immediately complied. When the Qoraish heard what had taken place they were astonished, and asked him why he had so promptly obeyed the summons. He replied: 'When Muhammad spoke these words, I perceived a dragon standing with open jaws over my head, and had I refused to obey I would have been swallowed immediately.'\n\n\\(^{439}\\) The meaning of both these designations, applied to the same man, has already been explained. See Notes 167 and 254.\nIt is related that once a murderer of the Bani Makhz\u00fbm made a conspiracy to assassinate his lordship while he was at prayers, and Abu Jahl, with Wolyd B. Moghyrah, were also of the party. At a time when that prince was engaged in prayers, standing between the E\u2019r\u00e1qy and Yemeny buttresses, Wolyd approached him with a murderous intention, but on arriving there he heard only the voice of his lordship reciting the Qur\u00e2\u0144, but could not see his person, and was obliged to return disappointed, whereon he informed the conspirators of his ill-success. Therefore some of them again went with Abu Jahl, heard the voice of the prophet, but saw not his person, and repeated their attempt several times in vain, passing beyond the apostle, whose voice they heard in their rear. At last they became convinced that the prophet enjoyed the protection of the Most High, and returned to their homes full of sorrow and disappointment. Allah\u2014who whose name be praised\u2014has said: \u2018And we have set a bar before them, and a bar behind them, and we have covered them with darkness wherefore they shall not see.\u2019\n\nThere is a tradition attributed to the Em\u00e2m Hasan\u2014u. w. b.\u2014to the effect that one day a man said to his holy and prophetic lordship: \u2018I had a little daughter whom I threw some time ago into such and such a river\u2014it being customary with the Arabs during the time of ignorance to destroy their own daughters\u2014and I requested his lordship to utter a prayer that my daughter might be resuscitated. The apostle complied, went to the bank of the river, hailed the little girl by her name, and exclaimed: \u2018Return to life by the power of God the Most High!\u2019 The child then immediately came out from the river, saying: \u2018I obey thee with pleasure, O apostle of God!\u2019 The prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014then said: \u2018Thy father and mother have become Musalm\u00e1ns; art thou willing to be restored to them?\u2019 The girl replied: \u2018I have need neither of father nor mother,\n\n440 Qur\u00e2\u0144, ch. xxxvi., 8. This verse, however, has no bearing on the present case, as appears plainly enough from the context.\nbecause I have found my God to be nearer to me than they.'\n\nIt is related, after Nu'm\u00e2n B. Bashyr the Anssary, that one of the professors of Isl\u00e2m had died at Madinah, that his body had been dressed and laid out in state, and that when the women assembled around him he uttered the following words in eloquent and distinct language: 'Muhammad the apostle of Allah is the illiterate prophet. This was written down in the book.' After that he said: 'He has spoken the truth.' Then he mentioned the names of some of the companions, and said: 'Greeting to thee, O apostle of God! may the blessing and mercy of God be upon thee!' After uttering these words he relapsed into his former state and expired.\n\nO'thm\u00e2n B. Hanyf relates that a blind man requested the apostle of God to pray that his sight might be restored, and his lordship said: 'Go, perform thy religious ablution; pray with two flexions, and then utter the following invocation: 'O God Most High, I desire to make Thy apostle, who is the prophet of mercy, my intercessor with Thee, that the veil of cecity may be uplifted from before my eyes. O God, accept the intercession of Muhammad for me.' The narrator states that the blind man obeyed the injunction, and his wish was fulfilled.\n\nThere is a tradition of Qot\u00e2dah B. Nu'm\u00e2n that he said: 'I prayed one night the dormitory prayers with his lordship, and although it was raining a little, and the night was very dark, I wished to return home. His lordship put a stick made of date-tree-wood into my hand, saying: \"Go with this, because from this stick ten lights will be kindled in thy front, and ten in thy rear. When thou enterest thy house, thou wilt see something black; strike it till it goes out; for it is Satan.\"' Qot\u00e2dah says: 'When I departed, the words of the apostle of God were fulfilled, there being ten lights before and ten behind me. When I entered my house, I perceived a man, whom I struck, as his lordship had commanded me, till he went out.'\nOne of the miracles of his lordship was the knowledge of events which happened after his decease. Thus, for instance, he predicted that some members of his family would be killed, and said to A\u2019li: \u2018The worst of men is he who will slay thee.\u2019 He also said: \u2018A\u2019li is the bestower of paradise and of hell; he will send his friends to the former, and his enemies to the latter place, and schismatics will be his foes.\u2019 He further said Dhu-n-n\u00fbryin [endowed with two lights] [viz., Othman] will be slain whilst reading the Qur\u2019an, and his blood will fall on the blessed verse: \u2018Verily Allah will reward you; for He hears everything, and He is most hearing and wise.\u2019 His lordship also predicted that intestine wars would arise during the life-time of O\u2019mar. He also gave information of the war of A\u2019li the Commander of the Faithful and of Zobayr Ala\u2019ww\u00e2m, which will soon be narrated in these pages. At the time the Musalm\u00e1ns were engaged in digging the fosse,411 he predicted that the insurgents would kill O\u2019mm\u00e2r Y\u00e2ser, and to A\u2019bdullah Zobayr he said: \u2018Woe to the people from thy hands, and woe to thee from the hands of the people.\u2019 Further, with reference to the Em\u00e2m Hasan\u2014salutation to him\u2014he said: \u2018He is the best man who makes peace between two factions.\u2019 He also said: \u2018Among my wives she is the best whose hands are the longest,\u2019 meaning Zaynab, whose hands were the longest,412 and surpassed those of all the others. He also said: \u2018Between the Tigris and the Euphrates a town will be built to which the houses of the earth will be drawn,\u2019 namely, Baghd\u00e1d. He said to Abu Ka\u2019b: \u2018Congratulate this nation on its splendour, greatness, conquests, and pomp on earth; but whoever covets a reward in this world will receive none in the next.\u2019\n\nThe writer of these pages says that records of all the miracles, and accounts of the pure wives, freed men, relicts, and everything else connected with his lordship the prince of existences\u2014the most excellent salutations to him\u2014have\n\n411 Qur\u2019an, ch. xxxiii., 9-13. 412 Stretched out in giving alms.\nbeen composed in detailed biographical works, by celebrated ancient and modern authors, and that, as all of them could not be mentioned in this book, some miracles only have been narrated by way of a blessing, with the hope that the unworthy author of this work will not incur the blame of his learned and intelligent readers.\n\nEND OF THE LIFE OF MUHAMMAD.\nAPPENDIX A.\n\nThe following pages, translated from the *Habib-us-Syar* by Khondemir, the maternal grandson of Mirkhond, the author of the *Rauzat-us-safa*, and containing an account of the wives, concubines, children, amanuenses, alms-gatherers, servants, freed men and women of Muhammad the apostle, will be found interesting as a supplement to the life of the prophet.\n\n**Record of the Pure Spouses of his Lordship the Prince of Existences\u2014the Perfumes of Blessings and the Breezes of Salutations be upon him.**\n\nIn the *Raudzatu-l-\u0101hb\u0101b* it is recorded, according to trustworthy authorities, that his holy and prophetic lordship introduced during his life-time twelve women into the bonds of matrimony, and consummated it with them. Concerning eleven of these there is no difference of opinion, but of one it is not certain whether she was a wife or a concubine, as shall be noticed hereafter, if it pleaseth Allah the Most High. All biographers agree that the first spouse of the prince of mankind was Khodayjah the greater\u2014may Allah reward her. She was the daughter of Khowylad, son of Asad, s. of A'bdu-l-u'zza, s. of Qossai, s. of Kall\u0101b. The noble pedigree of the most excellent of virtuous ladies and paragon of innocence converges in Qossai with the genealogy of his lordship the seal of prophecy. In dignity and relationship Khodayjah stood nearer to the prince of Arabs and non-Arabs than any of his other wives. The cognomen of Khodayjah was Omm Hind [mother of Hind], and her\nsobriquet was Tt\u00e2herah [the pure one]. Her mother was Fattimah the daughter of Asad, s. of Alassum, of the tribe Bani A\u2019amer B. Lowa. The first husband of Khodayjah was A\u2019tyq, s. of A\u2019abed, s. of A\u2019bdullah Makhz\u00fbmy, by whom she had a son and a daughter. After his death Abu H\u00e2lah, s. of Unnab\u00e2sh, s. of Zor\u00e2rah Bayh\u00e2qy, married her. According to one tradition the name of Abu H\u00e2lah was M\u00e1lek, according to another Zor\u00e2rah, and some allege that it was Zobayr, whilst others say it was Hind. The Sunnis admit that Khodayjah\u2014may Allah reward her\u2014had also by Abu H\u00e2lah two sons, namely, H\u00e2lah and Hind. Some chroniclers assert that Abu H\u00e2lah was Khodayjah\u2019s first and A\u2019tyq her second husband; but this tradition originated from Mukht\u00e2r, s. of Khoz.\n\nIn short, when the second husband of Khodayjah\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014had died, many chiefs and nobles of the Qoraish desired to marry her, but her ladyship would bestow her hand on no one, because when the waning moon of the existence of Abu H\u00e2lah had set in the west of annihilation, she dreamt one night that the sun had descended from the sky into her house, from which its light radiated. She related this dream to her cousin Waraqah, s. of Naofel, who replied: \u2018The interpretation of this vision is, that the prophet of the latter times will take thee into the bonds of matrimony.\u2019 Hereon Khodayjah\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014inquired for the name and position of the prophet of the Arabs and non-Arabs, and Waraqah communicated to her ladyship the seat of innocence all he knew on the subject. Khodayjah therefore always expected the rise of that sun of the sphere of prophecy, until she was exalted to the felicity of becoming his wife. At the time when the rays of the favour of the prince of existences shone upon the cheeks of her circumstances, his lordship was twenty-five years old, and according to the traditions of all Sunnis, Khodayjah\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014was at that time forty years of age. In the Kashafu-l-ghummah there is a tradition of Ebn A\u2019bb\u00e2s\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014that Khodayjah was married to his holy and prophetic lordship in her twenty-\neighth year, and that her dowry consisted of twelve Oqyahs\\(^{443}\\) of gold. It is an authentic fact that all the children of his lordship the best of the servants [of God] were born of Khodayjah, except the lord Ebr\u00e2him, to whom Maryah the Coptess gave birth. As long as Khodayjah the greater\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014was alive, the most excellent of men\u2014the greater blessings be on him\u2014would not, from regard for her noble mind, contract a marriage with any other woman.\n\nThe virtues and good qualities of Khodayjah\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014were numerous, her perfections and accomplishments innumerable. She was the first who believed in the prophethip of the prince of the righteous, and she freely spent everything she possessed in order to please him. There is a tradition of A\u2019li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014the blessings of the Most High be on him\u2014that the prophet\u2014the bl. of A. and peace be on him and on his family\u2014said: \u2018The best woman of past times was Mariam [Mary], and the best woman of our times is Khodayjah.\u2019 There is also a tradition of Ebn A\u2019bb\u00e2s\u2014u. w. b.\u2014that his holy and prophetic lordship said: \u2018The most excellent women among the inhabitants of paradise will be Mariam, the daughter of E\u2019mr\u00e2n;\\(^{444}\\) Khodayjah, the daughter of Khowylad; and Fattimah, the daughter of Muhammad; and Asiah, the daughter of Moz\u00e2hum.\u2019 There is a tradition of Anus, son of M\u00e2lek, that the prophet said: \u2018The best women of both worlds are, Mariam, the daughter of E\u2019mr\u00e2n; Khodayjah, the daughter of Khowylad; Fattimah, the daughter of Muhammad; and Asiah, the wife of Pharao.\u2019\n\nIt is recorded in the Kashafu-l-ghummah that A\u2019ayshah said to Fattimah: \u2018Shall I not rejoice you by telling you that I heard the apostle of God\u2014b. o. A., etc.\u2014say: The princesses of the inhabitants of paradise are four\u2014Mariam, the daughter of E\u2019mr\u00e2n; Fattimah, the daughter of Muhammad; Khodayjah, the daughter of Khowylad; and Asiah, the\n\n\\(^{443}\\) About forty-eight pounds sterling.\n\n\\(^{444}\\) This name is given to the father of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and ch. iii. of the Qur\u00e2n bears the title, \u2018Family of E\u2019mr\u00e2n.\u2019\ndaughter of Moz\u00e2hum, the wife of Pharao.\u2019 In the same book it is also mentioned that the lord of prophecy said: \u2018Paradise is anxious to receive four women\u2014Mariam, the daughter of E\u2019mr\u00e1n; Asiah, the daughter of Moz\u00e2hum; Khodayjah, the daughter of Khowylad; and Fattimah, the daughter of Muhammad.\u2019\n\nIn many respectable books it has been mentioned by veracious authors that one day Jebr\u00e2il\u2014salutation to him\u2014waited on his lordship the best of men\u2014b. o. h. and on his family till the day of resurrection\u2014and said: \u2018O apostle of God, this is Khodayjah, who is bringing to you a vessel full of almonds or of food. When she reaches you, announce to her the salutation of God and of me. Promulge to her the glad tidings that in paradise her abode will be in a hollow pearl, in which house there will be neither emnity nor strife.\u2019 When the lord Mussttafa [i.e., Muhammad] had informed Khodayjah of the greeting of God the Most High and Jebr\u00e2il, she replied: \u2018Upon Jebr\u00e2il and upon you, O apostle of God, be also the peace, mercy and blessing of God,\u2019 which elegant words bear testimony to the perfect intellect and discernment of Khodayjah\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014because by the abundance of her penetration she was aware that the Most High could not be greeted as human beings are, and therefore she did not say \u2018and peace to God,\u2019 as some of the companions had done when they made their profession of the Faith and were reproved.\n\nIt is related of A\u2019ayshah\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014that she said: \u2018I bore no such intense jealousy towards any woman as towards Khodayjah, although she was no longer alive, when I was exalted to the bed of the apostle\u2014b., etc.\u2014because the seal of prophets remembered her much, and when he slaughtered a sheep, he cut it into pieces which he occasionally sent to the women who had been the friends of Khodayjah; and I said to him from jealousy: \u201cPerhaps there existed no other woman besides Khodayjah?\u201d To which he replied: \u201cShe possessed many good qualities, and I had children by her.\u201d On a certain occasion H\u00e2lah,\nthe sister of Khodayjah, knocked at the door for admission, when the apostle\u2014b., etc.\u2014remembered the reply he had given, and became sorry. But, according to another tradition, he was glad, and said: \"O God, make her [i.e., A'ayshah] like H\u00e2lah.\" I, however, was jealous, and exclaimed: \"What makes you remember so much a Qoraish hag, who was so old that she had no longer any teeth in her mouth, whose life has come to an end, and in whose stead God\u2014whose name be glorified\u2014has given you another and a better one?\" Hereon his lordship became so angry that his head shook, and he exclaimed: \"I swear by Allah that He has not given me a better wife! She believed in me when all were infidels. She considered me to be veracious when everybody accused me of falsehood. She aided me with her property when all men kept aloof from me, and the boundless Giver has vouchsafed to me children by her.\" Ssiddyqah445\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014says: 'I replied, I shall speak no more ill of Khodayjah.' According to another tradition, she said: 'I shall never blame you with reference to Khodayjah.'\n\nIt is related that one day Omm Zafar, who had been the tire-woman of Khodayjah, came on a visit to his lordship the best of men\u2014greeting and peace to him\u2014and he received her honourably, saying: 'This woman used to come to our house in Khodayjah's time.' And, 'A good custom is a part of religion.' According to the most prevalent and correct tradition, the death of Khodayjah\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014took place in the month Ramadz\u00e2n, in the tenth year after the mission [A.D. 619]. The prophet\u2014o. w. b. b. a. p.\u2014entered her grave and buried her. It is in the Haj\u00fbn cemetery. According to the current tradition, she had attained the age of sixty, but according to another of sixty-five years, but Allah knows best the true state of the case.\n\n445 A'ayshah is called by this name after the epithet of her father 'the righteous,' whose full name was Abu Bakr-ussidyq, namely, 'father of Bakr, the faithful witness to the truth.'\nHer cognomen was Omm\\textsuperscript{446} Alaswad. She was the daughter of Zamqah, s. of Qays, s. of A\u2019bd\u00fb-sh-shams, s. of A\u2019bd\u00fb, s. of Nadzar, s. of M\u00e2lek, s. of Jabal, s. of A\u2019amer, s. of Low\u00e2, s. of Gh\u00e2leb, and in Low\u00e2 her pedigree becomes connected with that of the prophet\u2014o. w. b. b., etc.\u2014Her mother was Sham\u00fbs, the daughter of Qays, s. of A\u2019mru, s. of Zayd, s. of Lobeyd, s. of Khodd\u00e2sh. Soadah had first been married to her cousin S\u00eekr\u00e2n, s. of A\u2019mru, s. of A\u2019bd\u00fb-sh-shams, and had by him a son called A\u2019bd\u00fb-r-rahman, who attained martyrdom in the battle of Halaull\u00e2, during the time of the Commander of the Faithful O\u2019mar. Both S\u00eekr\u00e2n and Soadah had made their profession of Isl\u00e2m in the beginning of the mission, and were enrolled among the exiles of Abyssinia; but after they had returned from that country to Mekkah, Soadah dreamt one night that his lordship the apostle\u2014p. b. o. h.\u2014had come to her, and had placed his foot on her neck. This dream she related to S\u00eekr\u00e2n, who replied: \u2018If you speak the truth I shall die, and Muhammad will marry you.\u2019 After the death of S\u00eekr\u00e2n, in the tenth year after the mission, the prophet had, according to authentic traditions, married and taken her to himself before A\u2019ayshah, and her dowry was four hundred dirhems\\textsuperscript{447} of silver. When Soadah was overtaken by the weakness of old age, the apostle\u2014b., etc.\u2014wanted to divorce her, but she said: \u2018O prophet of God, do not divorce me, for I wish to have no carnal intercourse with you, because that appetite has left me; but I wish on the day of the resurrection to be reckoned among your noble spouses, and I yield my turn\\textsuperscript{448} to A\u2019ayshah. Accordingly the prince of this world\u2014b., etc.\u2014gave up his intention.\n\n\\textsuperscript{446} Although Omm literally means mother, it was often applied as a respectful term to women, and even to girls, thus being synonymous with \u2018madam\u2019 or \u2018miss.\u2019\n\n\\textsuperscript{447} About forty pounds sterling.\n\n\\textsuperscript{448} The husband is supposed to have intercourse by turns with every one of his wives, unless she surrenders her right.\nThere is a tradition of Abu Harirah\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014that he said: \u2018The apostle\u2014b., etc.\u2014took all his wives with him to the Hajjatu-l-wodaa\u2019 [pilgrimage of valediction], and on returning from that journey he said: \u201cThis was the pilgrimage of Isl\u00e2m, which you have performed, and henceforth you are no longer under the obligation to repeat it. You must hereafter abandon travelling, and go nowhere.\u201d But after the decease of his lordship the prince of inspired messengers\u2014b., etc.\u2014the mothers of the Faithful again went on pilgrimage, except Soadah and Zaynab, the daughter of Jahash, who, acting according to the above injunction, and said: \u201cAfter the death of the seal of prophets we shall mount no beast.\u201d\u2019 According to one tradition, the death of Soadah\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014took place towards the end of the Khalifate of the Commander of the Faithful O\u2019mar, and according to another it happened in the fifty-fourth year after the flight [A.D. 674], when the government of Moa\u2019wiah prevailed. According to the first tradition, she was also the first person for whom a bier was made.\n\nA\u2019ayshah, Daughter of Abu Bakr, s. of Abu Qoh\u00e2fah\u2014\n\n\u2014M. A. R. H.\n\nHer cognomen was Omm A\u2019bdullah, and her mother was Omm Rum\u00e2n, the daughter of O\u2019mayr, s. of Aa\u2019mer, of the Bani Wohm\u00e2n B. Alh\u00e2reth B. Ghanam B. M\u00e2lek B. Kan\u00e2nah. After Khodayjah\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014had been removed to the highest paradise, the seal of prophets received A\u2019ayshah into the bonds of matrimony when she was but six years old, and consummated it with her in the first year of the exile [A.D. 623], when she had become nine years of age. According to one tradition, her dowry was an amount of goods valued at fifty dirhems, but according to another it consisted of five hundred dirhems. A\u2019ayshah\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014was, according to the U\u2019lam\u00e2, distinguished by her knowledge of matters pertaining to\nthe religion, like the companions. In prudence and intellect she was the foremost of all the mothers of the Faithful, so that certain scholars adhere with reference to her to a tradition, according to which the prophet\u2014b., etc.\u2014is asserted to have said regarding her: 'Take one-third of your religion from this Hamyra.' Accordingly a great many of the companions and Ta'bi's [i.e., followers who came after them] have recorded the sayings of A'ayshah. It is related that A'rwah B. Zobayr\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014said: 'I never saw anyone more versed in the meaning of the Qur\u00e2n, and in the ordinances, obligations, commandments, permissions and prohibitions, ceremonies of the Arabs, and knowledge of genealogies, than A'ayshah\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014and the saying of the lord of prophecy has been verified that \"the excellence of A'ayshah is over [all other] women like the excellence of Tharyd\" over all other kinds of food.'\n\nIt is related of Ssiddyqah herself that she said: 'I was exalted above all other women in ten things. First, no other virgin except myself has obtained the honour to be married to his lordship. Second, the father and mother of none of the mothers of the Faithful had undergone exile for the religion of God except my parents. Third, with reference to my purity and innocence verses have been revealed. Fourth, before the prophet had married me, Jebr\u00e2il showed my portrait, drawn on a piece of silk, to his lordship, and had said: \"Marry this person.\" Fifth, I and the prophet\u2014b., etc.\u2014washed from one vessel, which honour had not been attained by any other woman. Sixth, when his lordship was praying I was, contrary to his other wives, allowed to remain in bed on such occasions. Seventh, his\n\n449 The text says: 'She was of the number of Muftis among the companions.' A Mufti is one whose sentence has the authority of the Law.\n\n450 This is a name of endearment for A'ayshah.\n\n451 Tharyd is a dish of bread, meat, or fruits broken up, on which soup is poured.\n\n452 Qur\u00e2n, ch. xxiv., 4-26. The verses were revealed for the purpose of exculpating A'ayshah from aspersions cast upon her, for having lagged behind the caravan on a certain occasion, and having some time afterwards been brought up to it by Ssafuw\u00e2n. See page 435 of this work.\nlordship received no Divine revelations when sleeping with any other woman, except with me. Eighth, the pure spirit of the best of men departed from my bosom [to the next world]. Ninth, his lordship died on the day when it was my turn [to cohabit with him]. Tenth, he was buried in my house.'\n\nIn the *Raudzatu-l-\u0101hb\u0101b* it is recorded that when his lordship the seat of prophecy was asked what man he loved most, he said: 'A'ayshah.' They asked: 'But of men?' And he replied: 'Her father.' It is known from authentic traditions that when the companions sent presents to his lordship, they despatched them to the house of A'ayshah to make them more acceptable. There were two divisions of the mothers of the Faithful; one consisted of A'ayshah, of Hafssah, of Soadah, and of Ssofyah; the other portion of Omm Solmah and of all the other pure spouses. Once the wives of the faction of Omm Solmah\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014said to her: 'Request the lord of beings to tell the people not to send their gifts on the day of A'ayshah's turn, but when they have to present any, to send them to the house of any of the mothers of the Faithful in which his lordship might happen to be at the time.' Omm Solmah\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014did as she was bid, but the seal of prophets\u2014the most excellent salutations to him\u2014rejoined: 'Do not distress me with reference to A'ayshah; for, verily, the Divine revelation has been sent to me in no other woman's sleeping apartment except in hers.' Omm Solmah then said: 'I ask pardon from God for having offended you, O apostle of God.' When those ladies were disappointed with Omm Solmah, they spoke on the subject to Fattimah, who likewise mentioned it to his lordship, and he asked: 'Daughter, lovest thou those whom I love?' She replied: 'I do.' His lordship said: 'Then love A'ayshah.'\n\nIn the chronicle of H\u00e1fez Abru an account is inserted from the *Rabyi'-l-abr\u0101r* and from the *K\u0101melu-s-sapinah*, how Moa'awayah B. Abu Sofy\u0101n, who was at Madinah in the year 56 [A.D. 675] for the purpose of the inauguration\nof Yazid, had insulted Husayn the son of A\u2019li Murtadza, A\u2019bdullah, the s. of O\u2019mar, A\u2019bdu-r-rahman, the s. of Abu Bakr, and A\u2019bdullah\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014in consequence whereof Ssiddyqah \u2014 m. A. r. h. \u2014 blamed and reproved him. Moa\u2019awyah therefore dug a well in his house, covered its top with reeds, and placed on these a chair of ebony. Then he invited Ssiddyqah to an entertainment and seated her on that chair, so that she fell into the well, which Moa\u2019awyah covered this time firmly with mortar, and departed from Madinah to Mekkah. In the Raudzatu-l-\u0101hb\u0101b it is, however, recorded that A\u2019ayshah departed this life on Tuesday, the 17th of the month Ramadz\u0101n, in the year 58 [A.D. 677], in consequence of a natural disease. She was buried the very night in which she died. Abu Harirah\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014held prayers over her body, and Q\u0101sum B. Muhammad B. Abu Bakr-us-ssiddyq, with A\u2019bdullah B. A\u2019bdu-r-rahman B. Abu Bakr, mixed with the Qoraish who were digging her grave in the Baqyi\u2019 cemetery and helped to bury her. But [the true] knowledge is with Allah the Most High.\n\nHafssah, Daughter of O\u2019mar B. Alkhatt\u0101b\u2014May Allah reward her!\n\nHer mother was Zaynab, the daughter of Motta\u2019wum B. Habyb B. Wohb B. Hudh\u0101fah. Hafssah was born five years before the mission. She was first married to Hanys B. Hudh\u0101fah B. Qays Sahmy, who had been present at the battle of Bedr, and after his decease the apostle of Allah\u2014bl., etc.\u2014married her, towards the end of the second or the beginning of the third year after the exile [A.D. 624 or 625]. His lordship had once divorced her, and being shortly afterwards visited by Qod\u0101mah and O\u2019thm\u0101n, who were the sons of Motta\u2019wum and uncles of Hafssah, she wept and said: \u2018The apostle of God has not divorced me on account of old age.\u2019 While they were conversing, his lordship condescended to make his appearance, whereon she covered her head with a veil, and he exclaimed: \u2018Jebr\u0101il has said to me: \u201cTake back Hafssah, because she fasts in the day\nand prays during the night; she will be thy wife in paradise.\u201d\n\nThe author of the Guzidah states that Hafssah\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014died during the Khalifate of Dhu-n-n\u00fbryn [i.e., O\u2019thman]\u2014Allah reward them both\u2014in the year 27 [A.D. 647], but according to the Raudzatu-l-\u00e2hb\u00e2b that event happened at the time of the government of Moa\u2019wyah in the year 45, or 41, or 47, or 50, after the exile [A.D. 665, 661, 667, or 670]. Merw\u00e2n B. Alhukm held prayers over her corpse. According to one tradition Hafssah was sixty years old when she died, and her sepulchre is in the cemetery of Baqyi\u2019.\n\nZaynab, the Daughter of Khodhaymah\u2014m. A. r. h.\n\nHer pedigree is connected by six links with that of A\u2019ameys B. Ssa\u2019ssa\u2019l. She was first the wife of Tofayl B. Alh\u00e2reth B. A\u2019bd-ul-Muttalleb. After Tofayl had divorced her, his brother A\u2019bdah B. Alh\u00e2reth married her according to one tradition, but according to another it was A\u2019bdullah Hajash Asdy, and when her second husband had departed from this, to the eternal world, the lord of prophecy married her, during the month Ramadz\u00e1n, in the third year after the exile [A.D. 625]; but she enjoyed that happiness only eight months, because in the month Rabyi\u2019 the second, of the fourth year after the exile, she died: some chroniclers even assert that she was only three months the wife of the prophet\u2014bl., etc. On account of the mercy and kindness she manifested towards destitute persons, she was surnamed \u2018the mother of the poor.\u2019\n\nOmm Solmah,453 Daughter of Abu Ommyah\u2014m. A. r. h.\n\nShe was called Hinda, and her father\u2019s name was Abu Ommyah, but, according to Ebn Jauzi, and according to some other historians, it was Khodayfah. It is also said that her father was Hesh\u00e2m B. Almoghyrah B. A\u2019bdullah B. O\u2019mar B. Mahd\u00fbm B. Yaqytz B. Aqr\u00e2h B. Ka\u2019b B.\n\n453 This name may also be taken literally: \u2018mother of Solmah.\u2019\nLow\u00e2 B. Gh\u00e2leb [so that her pedigree also was connected with that of Muhammad]. Barrah, the daughter of A\u2019bd-ul-Muttalleb, who was the mother of Omm Solmah, having been the paternal aunt of the prophet, she was related to him on that side also. At first, Omm Solmah\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014was the wife of Abu Solmah A\u2019bdullah B. A\u2019bdul-asad B. A\u2019bdul-leyl, by whom she had four children, namely: Zaynab, Solmah, O\u2019mar and Durrah. Both she and her husband had been refugees to Abyssinia, and when they had returned from that country to Madinah, her husband received a wound in the battle of Ohod, from which he died some time afterwards; whereon the prince of beings married her in the month Show\u00e2l during the fourth year after the exile. According to a certain tradition, her dowry was estimated at [only] four dirhems, but she was highly respected by the seal of prophets. Her death took place during the reign of Yazid, the s. of Moa\u2019awiah, in the sixty-first year after the exile [A.D. 680]. Abu Harirah officiated in the prayers recited over her body, and she was interred in the Baqyi\u2019 cemetery. She had attained the age of sixty-four years, and died the last of all the pure spouses of the prince of existences.\n\nZAYNAB, DAUGHTER OF JAHASH\u2014M. A. R. H.\n\nThe genealogy of Jahash joins that of Khodhaymah B. Mudrikah, who was connected with the ancestors of the prophet\u2014bl., etc.\u2014in the following manner: Jahash was the s. of Ta\u2019myr, s. of Dhysarah, s. of Murrah, s. of Kathyr, s. of Dud\u00e2n, s. of Asad, s. of Khodhaymah. The mother of Zaynab was likewise the paternal aunt of his lordship the prophet\u2014bl., etc.\u2014she being Ammymah, the daughter of A\u2019bd-ul-Muttalleb. The cognomen of Zaynab is Ommu-l-hukm, but her name was at first Barrah, which his lordship the best of men changed to Zaynab.\n\nFirst the prophet\u2014bl., etc.\u2014had asked [the hand of] Zaynab for Zayd B. H\u00e2reth; but her brother, A\u2019bdullah, s. of Jahash, was averse to the match. Then the following blessed verse was revealed on the subject: \u2018It is not fit for\na true believer of either sex, when Allah and His apostle have decreed a thing, that they should have the liberty of choosing a different matter of their own.\\footnote{Qur\u00e2n, ch. xxxiii. 36.} Subsequently they agreed to the marriage, and therefore his lordship the refuge of prophecy gave away Zaynab in marriage to Zayd, presenting her with a dowry of ten dinars of gold, sixty dirhems of silver, a coif,\\footnote{Coif made of fine linen about two cubits long, open in front.} a wrapper, a garment, fifty mauns of wheat, and thirty measures of dates. During one year and more Zayd lived amicably with his wife, but after that time he said: \u2018O apostle of God, I divorce your aunt\u2019s daughter.\u2019\\footnote{These words he is said to have uttered for fear of the prophet, who accidentally happened to see Zaynab alone and in undress.} Although his lordship knew by Divine revelation that Zaynab was to be enrolled among the mothers of the Faithful, he nevertheless said to Zayd: \u2018Take care of yourself and fear your Creator.\u2019 Zayd therefore cohabited a few days more with his wife, but divorced her at last. When, however, the \\textit{Y\u2019det}\\footnote{The \\textit{Y\u2019det} is when it is unlawful to have intercourse with a woman, namely, when she is in mourning for the death of her husband, or divorced, or menstruous.} had elapsed, the prophet\u2014bl., etc.\u2014said during the month Dhu-l-qa\u2019dah, in the fifth year after the exile [A.D. 626], to Zayd: \u2018Go and ask Zaynab in marriage for myself.\u2019 Zayd obeyed, but Zaynab said: \u2018I can give no reply until I have consulted my Creator.\u2019 Accordingly she retired to a corner and addressed her orisons to the courts of the Bountiful Granter of all good gifts, and prayed as follows: \u2018O God, Thy apostle intends to wed me. If I be worthy of him, them marry me to him.\u2019 The arrow of this request having hit the target of response, the following verse was revealed: \u2018But when Zayd had determined the matter concerning her [and had resolved to divorce her], we joined her in marriage unto thee; lest a crime should be [charged] on the true believers in [marrying] the wives of their adopted [sons] when they have determined the matter concerning them.\u2019\\footnote{Qur\u00e2n, ch. xxxiii., part of ver. 37.} On that occasion his lordship the refuge of\nprophecy brought honorification to the house of Zaynab without previously causing his advent to be announced, whereon Zaynab exclaimed: 'O apostle of God, without a proposer and without a witness?' His lordship, however, rejoined: 'God celebrates our marriage, and Jebr\u00e2il will be our witness.' Then he ordered food and a banquet to be prepared, and the people ate till they were filled with meat and bread. On the same day also the verse of the 'Veil' was revealed, as is related in detail in voluminous books. Zaynab died in the twelfth year after the exile, and F\u00e2ruq the greater\u2014A. r. h.\u2014held prayers over her. She died at the age of fifty years, and was interred in the Baqyi' cemetery.\n\n**Jaubaryah, Daughter of Alh\u00e2reth\u2014M. A. R. H.**\n\nHer name was Barrah, but his lordship the best of men changed it to Jaubaryah. She was the daughter of Alh\u00e2reth B. Dhar\u00e2r B. Habyb B. A'abed B. M\u00e2lek B. Khozaymah Khozaa'yah. Jaubaryah was first the wife of Dhu-sh-shafar B. Mos\u00e2fi' B. Ssafuw\u00e2n, who was slain in the campaign of Marsyi', and the prophet\u2014bl., etc.\u2014married her during the month of Ramadz\u00e2n of the sixth year after the exile [A.D. 627]. Jaubaryah died at Madinah in the year 55 or 56 [A.D. 674 or 675], and Merw\u00e2n B. Alhukm prayed over her body. According to the tradition of Ebn Jauzi, her age was sixty-five years, but the true knowledge is with Allah.\n\n**Omm Habybah, Daughter of Abu Sofyan\u2014M. A. R. H.**\n\nAccording to one tradition her name was Ramlah, and according to another Hinda. Her mother was Ssofyah, the paternal aunt of O'thm\u00e2n\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014the Commander of the Faithful. She was the daughter of Abu-l-a'ass B. Ommyah B. A'bdu-sh-shams. Omm Habybah had made a profession of the Faith in the beginning of Isl\u00e1m, and was married to A'bdullah B. Jahash Asdy, with whom\n\n---\n\n459 *I.e.*, O'mar, who became Khalifah.\nshe lived several years, and also emigrated with him to Abyssinia. She had a daughter by him, but towards the end of his life A'bdullah became an apostate, professed Christianity, and died in his errors in Abyssinia. During the sixth year after the exile [A.D. 627] the best of men wrote a letter to the Najj\u00e2shy requesting him to inform Omm Habybah that he desired to marry her. The Najj\u00e2shy explained the contents of that agreeable letter to Omm Habybah, and told her to appoint a deputy, whereon she named Kh\u00e2led B. Sa'y\u00eed, through whom the Najj\u00e2shy married her, by proxy, to the lord of prophecy, in the presence of Ja'fer T'tayy\u00e2r\u2014m. A. r. h.\u2014who was also one of the refugees of Abyssinia; and having granted her the sum of four hundred gold din\u00e2rs, or of four thousand silver dirhems, he paid that amount down during the ceremony, and despatched Omm Habybah, with Shorahbil and a number of Abyssinian refugees for her attendants, to his lordship the refuge of prophecy\u2014b., etc.\u2014and in the seventh year of the exile [A.D. 628] she was exalted to the company of his prophetic lordship. Her death took place during the reign of Moa'awiah, in the year 42 or 44 [A.D. 663 or 665], in the city of Madinah, and Merw\u00e2n held prayers over her body; but according to others she died in Syria.\n\nSsofyah, Daughter of E. Ahtt\u00e2b\u2014m. A. r. h.\n\nShe was a Jewess of the Bani Nadzyr, of the tribe Aaron\u2014to whom salutation\u2014and her mother was Dharr, the daughter of Samuel. Ssofyah was first the wife of Sollam, s. of Mashkam, and a separation having taken place between them, Kun\u00e2nah B. Raby\u00ee B. Abu-l-haqyq married her, but was slain in the battle of Khayber, and Ssofyah became a prisoner of war. The best of men\u2014b., etc.\u2014however liberated and married her. Having given her the price of her liberation for her marriage-portion, he consummated the wedding in the station called Ssob\u00e2n. When she became the spouse of the lord of prophecy she was\n\n460 Negus of Abyssinia. 461 Flying Ja'fer.\nseventeen years old, and, according to the author of the Guzidah, she died A.H. 36; but according to others A.H. 50 or 52. She was buried in the Baqy\u00ee' cemetery.\n\n**Maym\u00fbnah, Daughter of Alh\u00e2reth\u2014M. A. r. h.**\n\nHer name was first Barrah, but the best of men\u2014b., etc.\u2014changed it to Maym\u00fbnah. She was the daughter of Alh\u00e2reth B. Hazan B. Bahyr B. Enhazam B. Rubah B. A\u2019bdullah B. Hall\u00e2l B. A\u2019mer B. Ssa\u2019ssa\u2019h. Her mother, Hinda, was the daughter of A\u2019wuf B. Zohayr B. Alh\u00e2reth, of the tribe Hemyar, but others say of the tribe Kon\u00e2nah.\n\nHinda was considered to be the happiest old woman on earth, because God the Most High had vouchsafed her a son-in-law of high station. She had first two daughters by H\u00e2reth: Maym\u00fbnah and Ommu-l-fadzl, the former being married to the prince of the world\u2014b., etc.\u2014and the latter to A\u2019bb\u00e2s\u2014A. r. h. By A\u2019mys Khasha\u2019y, who was her second husband, Hinda had also other daughters, one of whom was Asm\u00e2, the first wife of Ja\u2019fer B. Abu Tt\u00e2leb, afterwards married to Ssiddyq the greater\u2014A. r. them both\u2014but when the Commander of the Faithful Abu Bakr died, she was married to [A\u2019li] the sovereign of all virtues. Zaynab, another daughter of Hinda, whom she had by A\u2019mys, was wedded by the Amir Hamzah, the prince of martyrs\u2014A. r. h.\u2014and Solmah, yet another daughter by the same husband, was given in marriage to Sadad B. Alhad\u00e2d.\n\nIn short, during the time of ignorance, Maym\u00fbnah was married to Masu\u2019d B. A\u2019mru Saqfy, but after they had separated it happened that Abu-dirham, or A\u2019bdu-l-u\u2019zza, or Sarab, the son of Abu-dirham, or A\u2019bdu-l-layl, the son of A\u2019mru, married her. After the decease of her second husband, Maym\u00fbnah was, however, in consequence of her propitious destiny, in the seventh year after the exile [A.D. 629], exalted to the happiness of becoming the spouse of his lordship the prophet\u2014b., etc.\u2014who consummated the\n\n---\n\n462 Abu Bakr, the successor of Muhammad.\n463 Namely, before the promulgation of Isl\u00e2m.\nmarriage on his return from the O'mratu-l-qadz\u00e2 [the decreed pilgrimage] in the noble habitation of Maym\u00fbnah; but she died likewise in the same place, and was buried there, according to the author of the Guzidah. That event, however, took place in the year 38 [A.D. 658], and according to another tradition in 61 [A.D. 681]. If, therefore, the last tradition be correct, Maym\u00fbnah must have been the last of the mothers of the Faithful who died, and not Omm Solmah; the knowledge, however, is with the Most High and Holy.\n\nThe Concubines.\n\nThe prince of divinely inspired messengers\u2014b., etc.\u2014had four concubines. The first was M\u00e2ryah the Coptess, daughter of Shima'\u00fbn, whom 'Maqoqush the governor [of Alexandria] had sent by way of gift to his lordship the best of men\u2014b., etc.\u2014who made use of her in the kingdom of Yemen [sic], and begat with her Ebr\u00e2him. The death of M\u00e2ryah took place during the time of the Khalifate of the Commander of the Faithful O'mar\u2014A. r. h.\u2014in the year 16 [A.D. 637], and she was buried in the Baqy\u00ee cemetery.\n\nSecondly: Rayh\u00e2nah, who was a captive from among the Bani Nadzyr, or the Bani Qorytt; and the prophet\u2014b., etc.\u2014selected her for his own portion, leaving her the option to make a profession of Isl\u00e2m or to remain in her own religion; Rayh\u00e2nah, however, preferred to become a Musalm\u00e2n, and his lordship made use of her in the kingdom of Yemen [sic]. There is, however, a tradition that in the Muharram of the sixth year of the exile [A.D. 627] he liberated her and married her, which assertion Waqidy has accepted, but A'bdu-l-barr and others have reckoned her among the number of concubines. According to one tradition she died during the year of the Hajjatu-l-wodaa' [pilgrimage of valediction], but according to another in the time of the Khalifate of O'mar; the first, however, is more correct. Allah is most knowing and wise!\nThirdly: The slave-girl Jamylah who had fallen to the portion of his lordship the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\u2014from among the captives.\n\nFourthly: The slave-girl whom Zaynab, the daughter of Jahash had presented to his lordship.\n\nLet it not remain concealed that, as there would be no use in enumerating the women to whom his lordship was betrothed, but had not consummated the marriage, or whom he merely asked to marry, and was not even betrothed to them, their names are here omitted.\n\nThe Sons of the Best of the Servants of God\u2014b., etc.\n\nBy universal consent the number of the male children of the intercessor on the day of the resurrection amounted to three, namely, Q\u00e2sim, A\u2019bdullah, and Ebr\u00e2him.\n\nQ\u00e2sim was born by Khodayjah\u2014A. r. h.\u2014in Mekkah, before the mission.\\(^{464}\\) He lived only two years, and then hastened to the eternal world.\\(^*\\)\n\nA\u2019bdullah, who was surnamed \u2018the agreeable,\u2019 was born of Khodayjah after the mission, and died in infancy.\n\nEbr\u00e2him was the son of M\u00e2ryah the Coptess, and was born at Madinah in the eighth year of the exile [A.D. 629-30]. On the seventh day after his birth the apostle\u2014b., etc.\u2014slaughtered a sheep to celebrate his nativity, got his head shaved, and distributed as alms a sum of gold equal in weight to his hair. According to a certain tradition, Omm Sayf, the wife of Abu Sayf the blacksmith, was appointed to nurse Ebr\u00e2him, who lived almost one year and a half, and died in the tenth year of the exile [A.D. 631-32]. After his death Ebr\u00e2him was washed by his nurse, but according to another tradition, Fadzl B. A\u2019bbas\u2014A. r. t.\u2014performed that duty. A\u2019bdu-r-rahman B. A\u2019wuf\u2014A. r. t.\u2014poured the water on his corpse, and his lordship the seat of prophecy was present at the ablution. In the Raudzatu-l-\u00e2hb\u00e2b it is, however, stated that, according to the most correct tradition, the prophet\u2014b., etc.\u2014prayed over his body, and sat at the head of his grave until he was\n\n\\(^{464}\\) A.D. 610 was the year of the mission.\ninterred. Fadzl, the son of A\u2019bb\u00e2s, and As\u00e2mah, the son of Zayd, entered the sepulchre, and when they had finished the burial, they arranged the surface of the grave and poured water over it; and the first grave in Isl\u00e2m over which water was poured was that of the lord Ebr\u00e2him; but the knowledge is with God, whom we adore.\n\nThe Noble Daughters.\n\nThe number of the exalted daughters of the prince of existences\u2014b., etc.\u2014amounted, according to the consent of the whole Sunni sect, to four, namely, Zaynab, Raqyah, Omm Kalth\u00fbm, and the princess of women, Fattimah Zohr\u00e2\u2014salutation to them. The author, however, of the Aa\u2019ll\u00e1mu-l-war\u00e2\u2019, and some other Shia\u2019h U\u2019lam\u00e2, allege that his lordship the best of men had no daughters except Zohr\u00e2, and that Zaynab, Raqyah, and Omm Kalth\u00fbm had only been adopted by his lordship from Khodayjah the greater. But in this respect the plain statement of the author of the Kashafu-l-qhummah tallies with the opinion of the entire Sunni sect; for when enumerating the spouses of the Commander of the Faithful A\u2019li\u2014b., etc.\u2014he says: \u2018Muhammad Allawsatt\u2019s mother was Em\u00e2mah, the daughter of Abu-l-a\u2019ass, and this Em\u00e2mah was the daughter of Zaynab, the daughter of the apostle of God\u2014b., etc.\u2019; and also, when mentioning the children of Khodayjah by A\u2019tyq, the son of A\u2019bedah Makhz\u00fbmy, and by Abu H\u00e2lah, he names Zaynab and Raqyah and Omm Kalth\u00fbm; but the knowledge is with God, whose name be exalted and hallowed!\n\nZaynab was, according to the first [i.e., Sunni] tradition, born thirty years after the catastrophe of the elephant,\\(^{465}\\) and when she attained the age of puberty she was married to her maternal aunt\u2019s son Abu-l-a\u2019ass B. Rabyi\u2019 B. A\u2019bdul-u\u2019zza B. A\u2019bdu-sh-shams B. A\u2019bd Mun\u00e2f; and her husband having been made prisoner in battle, Zaynab sent the necklace which Khodayjah\u2014A. r. h.\u2014had given her as his\n\n\\(^{465}\\) Qur\u00e2n, ch. cv., bears the title \u2018The Elephant,\u2019 and this catastrophe happened in the very year of the prophet\u2019s birth, A.D. 570.\nransom from Mekkah to Madinah. When the eye of the apostle of God\u2014b., etc.\u2014alighted on that trinket, he remembered Khodayjah \u2014 A. r. h. \u2014 was much touched, sent it back again, and liberated Abu-l-a\u2019ass, but said to him: \u2018When you arrive in Mekkah you must send Zaynab to me, because Isl\u00e2m and unbelief have separated you.\u2019 Abu-l-a\u2019ass did as he was told, but some time afterwards the love of Isl\u00e2m took root in his heart, so that he went to Madinah and became a Musalm\u00e2n. According to one tradition, the lord of prophecy restored to him Zaynab by the right of his previous marriage, but according to another he renewed it. Zaynab had by Abu-l-a\u2019ass a son, A\u2019li by name, and a daughter called Em\u00e2mah, the former dying before the age of puberty; but the latter was married to A\u2019li Murtadza after the demise of the princess of women, according to her own last wish. The death of Zaynab took place during the lifetime of the lord of existences\u2014b., etc.\u2014in the eighth year of the exile [A.D. 629-30]. Her corpse was washed by Soadah, the daughter of Zama\u2019h, by Omm Solmah, Omm Ayman, and Omm O\u2019ttyah the Anssaryah. His lordship the best of men presented his own loin-cloth to her, which became afterwards a custom, and after she had been washed and shrouded, he held prayers over her corpse, entered the sepulchre, and buried her.\n\nRaqyah was, according to the U\u2019lam\u00e2 of the Sunnis, born in the thirty-third year after the catastrophe of the elephant, and when she attained the age of puberty she was married to O\u2019tbah B. Abu Lahab; but before the marriage was consummated the S\u00fbrah Tabbat\\(^{466}\\) was revealed, whereon Abu Lahab advised his son to divorce Raqyah, which that wretch did in the presence of the best of men, adding also other insulting expressions; but his\n\n\\(^{466}\\) This is the title and also the first word of chapter cxi. of the Qur\u00e2n. This S\u00fbrah being very short, I here subjoin a literal translation of the whole of it: \u2018Perish the hands of Abu Lahab, and perish he. Not will enrich him his property, nor what he gained. He will go down into fire, endued with flames; and his wife the carrier of the wood; on her neck a rope of palm-fibres.\u2019\nlordship raised his hands in prayer, and said: 'O God, appoint over him a dog of Thy dogs!' Shortly afterwards O'tbah had occasion to travel to Syria, and in the halting-place Zaraq\u00e2, one night, a lion made an end of him by sending him to the abyss of hell. After that the prophet of the latter times gave Raqyah in marriage to the Commander of the Faithful O'thm\u00e2n, and Dhu-n-n\u00fbryyn emigrated with her to Abyssinia, where she had a son by him, called A'bdullah, who reached the age of two or of six years, when a cock struck his eyes with the beak and he died. Raqyah departed this life in the second year of the exile [A.D. 623-24] and according to the most correct tradition the prophet\u2014b., etc.\u2014had at that time not yet returned to Madinah from the expedition of Bedr.\n\nOmm Kalth\u00fbm\u2014A. r. h.\u2014had first been named Aminah and was betrothed to O'tibah the son of Abu Lahab, who likewise repudiated her by his father's command and his brother's precedent, before consummating the marriage. After the death of Raqyah, Kalth\u00fbm was in the third year of the exile [A.D. 624-25] given in marriage to the Commander of the Faithful O'thm\u00e2n\u2014A. r. h.\u2014and according to a certain tradition she had one child by Dhu-n-n\u00fbryyn, but according to another she had many, all of whom died, however, in their infancy. Omm Kalth\u00fbm departed to the gardens of paradise in the ninth year of the exile [A.D. 630-31], and her corpse was washed by Asm\u00e2, the daughter of O'mys; by Ssofyah, the daughter of A'bd-ul-Muttalleb; and by Omm O'ttyah the Anssaryah. The prophet\u2014b., etc.\u2014was present near her grave and wept. When Omm Kalth\u00fbm was lowered into her tomb, he said: 'From it we have created you, to it we return you, and from it we shall take you out a second time.' He further said: 'In the name of Allah, in the path of Allah, and in the religion of the apostle of Allah.'\n\nThe princess of women, Fattimah Zohr\u00e2\u2014A. r. h.\u2014was, according to the statements of all the chief U'lam\u00e2 and scholars, the most beloved of the children of the prophet of latter times, and was by her superior nobility of mind\nand excellent qualities distinguished above all her brothers and sisters. It is recorded in the *Kashafu-l-ghummah* that Ebn Khis\u00e2b has, in his chronicle of the births and deaths of the members of the family of the prince of existences, stated, with the proper authorities taken from Abu Ja\u2019fer Muhammad B. A\u2019li Alb\u00e2qer\u2014b., etc.\u2014that the birth of Fattimah\u2014A. r. h.\u2014took place five years after the announcement of prophecy and the descent of revelation, and that she departed from this world at the age of eighteen years and seventy-five days; but according to another tradition she terminated her noble life at the age of eighteen years, one month, and fifteen days. She lived with her father in Mekkah for eight years, and she fled to Madinah with the apostle of God\u2014b., etc.\u2014and dwelt with him there ten years, and she was then eighteen years old. She lived with the Commander of the Faithful A\u2019li\u2014b., etc.\u2014seventy-five days after the death of her father, but according to another tradition forty days. In the *Tanf\u00eeh* of Ebn Jauzy it is stated that the birth of Fattimah\u2014o. w. peace\u2014took place five years before the mission, and in the *Raudzatu-l-\u00e2hb\u00e2b* two traditions are recorded on this subject, the first whereof agrees with that of the *Tanf\u00eeh*, but the second is to the effect that this luminary of the sphere of prophecy arose from the horizon of nativity in the forty-first year after the catastrophe of the elephant. In the just-mentioned work it is also narrated that the decease of Fattimah\u2014salutation to her\u2014took place during the night of Tuesday, the third day of the month Ramadz\u00e2n, which happened six, and according to others three, months after the death of the prophet. On account of the two traditions adopted from the *Raudzatu-l-\u00e2hb\u00e2b* concerning the birth of Fattimah\u2014A. r. h.\u2014that noble lady must have reached the age of twenty-eight or of twenty-two years; but the [true] knowledge is with Allah.\n\nIn the *Kashafu-l-ghummah* it is recorded, according to the precedent of those who walk in the paths of the Em\u00e2ms, that the prince of the righteous\u2014b., etc.\u2014had\nsaid: 'During the night of my ascension I ate one fresh date of the fruits of the trees of eternity, which was more soft than butter and more sweet than honey, and the essence of that date generated seed within my loins. When I [again] alighted on earth I approached Khodayjah\u2014A. r. h.\u2014and she became pregnant with Fattimah.' The seal of prophets\u2014b., etc.\u2014also said: 'O Khodayjah, the faithful spirit of Allah\\textsuperscript{467} has apprised me that this child will be a daughter. Call her Fattimah, because it is a pure and blessed name.'\n\nWhen the time of the delivery of Khodayjah was near at hand, she sent for several of her relatives to aid her on that occasion; but as she had incurred their displeasure by marrying the prophet\u2014b., etc.\u2014they would not comply with her request, so that she was much distressed. Nevertheless, four women, resembling those of the tribe Bani H\u00e2shem, suddenly made their appearance, and Khodayjah was afraid of them. One of them, however, said: 'Fear naught, for God the Most High has sent us to you. We are your visitors. I am Sarah; this is Mariam, the daughter of E'mr\u00e2n; the third is Kalth\u00fbm, the sister of Moses; and the fourth is Asiah, the wife of Pharao. They will be your companions in paradise.' Then one of these women sat down on the right and another on the left of Khodayjah, the third in her front, and the fourth in her rear, until Fattimah was born. When this took place a light shone from that infant of laudable end, which encircled the houses of Mekkah from the east and west, so that there was no spot in any house which was not illuminated by that light:\n\nDistich: The light of prosperity shone,\nMaking my heart to gladness prone.\n\nIn the above-named work it is also recorded that the Lord and Bestower of all gifts sent ten H\u00fbris from the uppermost paradise into the apartment of the pure Khodayjah, each of whom brought a basin and a pitcher\n\n\\textsuperscript{467} I.e., Gabriel.\nfull of water from the Kawthar.\\textsuperscript{468} Then the woman sitting in front of Khodayjah took hold of Fattimah and washed her with that water from paradise, and afterwards she brought forth white and extremely fragrant swaddling clothes in which she wrapped the infant; then she drew a similar cloth over the child's head by way of a coif, and said: 'Take her, Khodayjah. Give way to no apprehensions, for blessing is in her and in her progeny.' Then the other women congratulated Khodayjah and departed, whilst she embraced Fattimah with great joy and happiness. When the lord of prophecy\u2014b., etc.\u2014entered, he took the darling child into his arms, called her Fattimah, and surnamed her Omm Muhammad, but her sobriquets are numerous, such as, the blessed, the pure, the innocent, the pleasing, the pleased, the orthodox, the Vestal,\\textsuperscript{469} and Zohr\u00e2.\\textsuperscript{470}\n\nIt is related by the true Em\u00e2m Ja\u2019fer Ss\u00e2diq\u2014b., etc.\u2014that his holy and prophetic lordship asked Fattimah one day whether she knew why she was called by that name, and A\u2019li the Commander of the Faithful having thereon also asked for the reason, his lordship replied: 'Because she delivered her soul from fire.' It is related that Hayder Kar\u00e2r\\textsuperscript{471}\u2014b., etc.\u2014said: 'Verily the prophet was asked what Bet\u00eel meant, and he replied: \"It is a woman who never sees redness; namely, she never menstruates, because menstruation is hateful in the daughters of prophets.\"' It is recorded that the Em\u00e2m Muhammad All\u00e2qer\u2014b., etc.\u2014having been asked why the princess of women had been surnamed Zohr\u00e2, he replied: 'Because God had magnified her, and when she arose she illuminated the heavens and the earth with her light, and the eyes of the angels were dazzled, so that they prostrated\n\n\\textsuperscript{468} This is the title of ch. cviii. of the Qur\u00e2n, and is generally explained as the name of a lake or river in paradise.\n\n\\textsuperscript{469} The word in the text is Bet\u00fbl, which means 'virgin,' and is an epithet of Fattimah, but among Eastern Christians of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\n\\textsuperscript{470} Zohr\u00e2 means the planet Venus, and also bright, lovely, splendid, etc.\n\n\\textsuperscript{471} Meaning, 'lion of attack,' one of the names of A\u2019li.\nthemselves, worshipping God, and saying: \"O our God and Lord, what is this light?\" Whereon God vouchsafed to them the following revelation: \"This is a light of My light; I cause it to dwell in My heaven; I created it from My greatness; I produced it from my forehead, and from a prophet more excellent than all the other prophets. From that light I shall produce Em\u00e2ms who will promulge My commands, and propagate My truth, and I shall cause them to be Khalifahs on My earth;\" and here the revelation ceased.'\n\nAs has been narrated above, the lord of dominion [i.e., Ali] married in the second year of the exile [A.D. 623] the princess of women, who was on that occasion, according to the tradition of the Em\u00e2ms of the family [of Muhammad], nine, but according to another statement fourteen, years old. Some even assert that she was twenty years of age.\n\nIt is related in the Ssoh\u00e2h-akhb\u00e2r that when A'ayshah\u2014A. r. h.\u2014was asked what person the prophet of genii and men loved most, she replied: 'Fattimah.' They said: 'Of men?' She replied: 'Her husband.' It is likewise related of Ssiddyqah\u2014A. r. h.\u2014that she said: 'I never saw any person resembling the apostle of God more than Fattimah in her countenance, in elegance of speech, in dignity, and in all her motions. Whenever Fattimah paid a visit to the best of men he rose, kissed her, and made her sit down in his own place. Whenever his lordship the refuge of prophecy came to her house, Fattimah acted in the same manner. It is also an authentic fact that the prophet\u2014b., etc.\u2014said: 'Fattimah is a part of me; whoever injures her injures me, and whoever angers her angers me.' According to some traditions, he also said: 'Allah gets angry when Fattimah gets angry.'\n\nIt is related of Thaub\u00e2n, the freed man of the prophet of the last times, that he said: 'When the best of men started on a journey, the last person of whom he took leave was Fattimah Zohr\u00e2, and when he returned the first person whom he met was Bet\u00fbl.' In the Kashaj\u00fb-l-ghummah there is a tradition of Abu Ay\u00e2b that the prophet\u2014u. w. b.\n\u2014said: \u2018On the day of the resurrection a herald will exclaim from within the throne [of God]: \u201cO ye assembled people, bend down your heads and shut your eyes, that Fattimah may pass to the bridge Sser\u00e2t,\u201d and with her seventy thousand H\u00fbris having large eyes will walk as attendants.\u201d\u2019 It is related of Abu Sa\u2019yd Khadhry\u2014A. r. h.\u2014that he said: \u2018The prophet\u2014b., etc.\u2014declared that Fattimah will be the best of women in paradise, except Mariam, the daughter of E\u2019mr\u00e1n.\u2019 In the book on the pupil of the eye [i.e., on Fattimah] it is narrated in detail that when the blessed verse \u2018And to relatives their dues\u2019 was revealed, the lord of beings\u2014b., etc.\u2014presented to Fattimah Zohr\u00e2 the landed property of Fadak, which afterwards Ssiddyq Akbar added to all the other possessions left [by the prophet after his death], but would not surrender to her. When the Commander of the Faithful A\u2019li, and Zohr\u00e2\u2014A. r. t.\u2014spoke to him on the subject, he replied: \u2018I heard the apostle of God\u2014b., etc.\u2014say: \u201cWe prophets do not appoint heirs.\u201d\u2019 In the Kashafu-l-ghummah it is related of the Em\u00e2m Muhammad Alb\u00e2qer\u2014p. b. o. h.\u2014that after the decease of the prophet the Commander of the Faithful A\u2019li said to the princess of women: \u2018Go to the successor of the apostle of God and ask for your inheritance.\u2019 She did so, but Abu Bakr replied: \u2018A prophet has no heirs.\u2019 She retorted, saying: \u2018Did not Solomon inherit the property of David?\u2019 He repeated: \u2018A prophet has no heirs.\u2019 She continued: \u2018Has not God\u2014whose name be blessed and exalted\u2014said: \u201cGod recommends to you your children\u201d? \u2019 In short, several voluminous books embody whatever passed on this subject between the Commander of the Faithful A\u2019li and the Commander of the Faithful Abu Bakr and the Commander of the Faithful O\u2019thm\u00e2n; but Abu Bakr again restored Fadak to the members of the [prophet\u2019s] family. He gave, however, to Bet\u00fbl\n\n472 This bridge is finer than a hair and sharper than a sword.

Secondly, Jacob, who wept so much on account of his separation from Joseph\u2014s. t. h.\u2014that he became blind. Thirdly, Joseph, who deplored in prison his separation from Jacob to such a degree that all the captives were distressed. Fourthly, Fattimah\u2014p. t. h.\u2014who wept so much after the death of the prophet\u2014b., etc.\u2014that the inhabitants of Madinah sent her the following message: \"O darling of the lord of existences, you have indeed distressed us by your fervent lamentations.\" Then Bet\u00fbl Zohr\u00e2 betook herself at last to the cemetery of the martyrs, and wept there. Fifthly, the fourth Em\u00e2m, who was constantly shedding tears on account of the calamity of Kerball\u00e2, so that his attendants could never place any food before him without its being moistened by the water of his eyes.' It is related of Muhammad Alb\u00e2qer the Em\u00e2m of exalted memory that he said: 'After the decease of his holy and prophetic lordship, no one ever saw Fattimah laugh till her very dying day.' It is related that Zohr\u00e2\u2014s. t. h.\u2014called in her last malady for Solmy the freed woman of the lord Mussttafa, and said: 'Bring me\n\n\\textsuperscript{473} Abu Bakr is by some alleged to have disliked A\u2019li because he might have become the successor of the prophet; but A\u2019ayshah is said to have managed to keep away A\u2019li during the last moments of the prophet\u2019s life for fear he might appoint him successor in lieu of her own father, Abu Bakr.\nsome water for ablution.' Solmy narrates: 'After she had washed herself so beautifully as I had never before seen anyone doing it so well, she asked for clean garments and donned them. Then she ordered me to spread out her couch, whereon she reclined, turned with her right side to the Qiblah, and, placing her right hand beneath her face, she said: \"Solmy, I shall this moment depart from the abode of perishableness to the mansions of eternity, and I have washed myself that no one may undress me.\" When she had uttered these words, her spirit took flight to the upper regions.' Shortly afterwards A'li the Commander of the Faithful\u2014b., etc.\u2014entered, and, witnessing the scene, poured forth tears from the clouds of his eyes. This event is, according to the *Raudzatu-l-\u0101hb\u0101b*, described in the same manner by Muhammad B. Sa'd and the amanuensis in his *Ttabaq\u0101t*; but if it be true, it must be considered as one of the peculiarities of Fattimah\u2014A.r.h.\u2014because it is against the commandments of the doctors of the law [to omit the ablution of a corpse].\n\nIn the *Kashafu-l-ghummah* it is related that Bet\u016bl Zohr\u0101\u2014s. t. h.\u2014when she was near her death, called Asm\u00e2 the daughter of O'mys, and said: 'Asm\u00e2, one day Jebr\u0101il\u2014s. t. h.\u2014paid a visit to my father when he was sick, and brought him some camphor of paradise for his *Han\u016btt*. My father divided it into three parts. Keeping one for himself and giving the other two to me, he said: \"Preserve the one share for yourself, and the other for A'li Murtadza.\" Asm\u00e2, that camphor, which weighs forty mithq\u00e2ls, I have laid by in a certain place. The twenty mithq\u00e2ls which belong to me you are to put near my head; but give the other twenty to the lord A'li Murtadza.' When Asm\u00e2 had done this, Fattimah\u2014s. t. h.\u2014said: 'Go out and leave me alone. Call out my name after a short time: if I answer, it is all well and good; but if I remain silent, be aware that I have departed to my noble father.' Asm\u00e2 obeyed, and shortly afterwards called out: 'O daughter of Muhammad the elect!' but received no answer. She there-\n\n474 Any aroma or perfume intended for a corpse.\nfore again entered the apartment, and, removing the veil from the countenance of the princess of women, she perceived that her soul had departed from the abode of grief to the palace of joy. Then she prostrated herself, approached, and kissed her, saying: 'O Bet\u00fbl, when you arrive in the paradise of your father, convey to him my greeting and petition.' On that occasion the lord and Em\u00e2m Hasan entered with the Em\u00e2m Husayn\u2014b., etc.\u2014and asked: 'Asm\u00e2, is our mother asleep?' Asm\u00e2 replied: 'Your mother is not asleep, but has departed to the proximity of the mercy of the Lord of lords.' Hereon both commenced to weep and to lament, and proceeded to the mosque of the Arabian prophet for the purpose of informing A'li Murtadza\u2014b., etc.\u2014of the event. When they had reached the vicinity of that blessed locality their voices of lamentation became very loud, so that some of the companions who were sitting there with A'li exclaimed: 'What makes you cry, O [grand] sons of the prophet of God? Allah forbid that you should weep!' Then they related what had taken place, and the lion of attack\u2014b., etc.\u2014was so overpowered by grief that he fell prostrate on his face, and uttered the following words: 'O daughter of the prophet of God, after his lordship's death you were my consolation; but who will calm the pain of endless separation and of infinite exile when you are no more?' Then he pronounced the following two distichs:\n\nEach meeting of two friends has an end,\nEvery grief is slight, except separation;\nIf I have lost Fattimah after Ahmad,\nIt is a sign that no friend remains.\n\nThen the king and refuge of dominion [i.e., Ali] hastened to the apartment of Tt\u00e2herah,475 and ordered Asm\u00e2 to wash and to shroud the princess of the women of both worlds, and interred her body in the Baqyi' cemetery. The author of the Kashafu-l-ghummah says: 'Ebn Babuyah\u2014A. h. m. o. h.\u2014reports the matter as follows, and I consider him to be correct: She was buried in her own house, but when\n\n475 Literally, 'the pure one,' i.e., Fattimah.\nthe [graves of the] Ommyades increased in the mosque her body was [likewise] interred in the same, and in what I have reported I have only stated what is known and generally believed by the people, by historians and biographers, that, as stated above, she had been interred in the Baqy\u00ee cemetery.\n\nIt is related in the Raudzatu-l-dhb\u00e2b that according to one tradition A\u2019li Murtadza, and according to another A\u2019bb\u00e2s\u2014A. r. t.\u2014prayed over the corpse of Fattimah. The next day the two Sheikhs\u2014A. r. t.\u2014and all the companions of the best of men, reproached Hayder [the Lion, i.e., A\u2019li] the Commander of the Faithful, saying: \u2018Why have you not informed us, that, by being present at the honour of the prayers over Fattimah, we might ourselves have been honoured?\u2019 But the king of dominion answered: \u2018I have acted thus by her own injunction.\u2019\n\nIn the Raudzatu-sh-shalhd\u00e2 [mausoleum of martyrs] it is recorded that according to the tradition of the Ahlu-l-beyt [members of the family] the death of Fattimah, the daughter of the prince of existences, took place on Tuesday, the third day of the blessed month Ramadz\u00e2n, in the eleventh year of the exile [A.D. 632], and that she was buried in the Raudzat-maqadasat [sacred mausoleum].\n\nThe author of the present work states that some who wrote down the traditions concerning the members of the family assert that Zohr\u00e2 died seventy-five days after the prince of mortals; others, however, say forty days. The Kashafu-l-ghummah has a tradition from the Dhariat-Tt\u00e2harat, the author of which is Dull\u00e2by, that Zohr\u00e2 lived three months after the decease of the Mussttafa\u2014b., etc.\u2014and the number of days given by the Em\u00e2m Muhammad Alb\u00e2qer is ninety-five. None of these traditions, however, imply that this great calamity had taken place on the third day of the blessed month Ramadzan, because in reality the death of the daughter of the prince of existences took place at the end of the month Ssafar, or in the beginning of Rabi\u2019 anterior in the same year; the [true] knowledge, however, is with God, who is to be adored.\nIn the *Tanfih* of Ebn Jauzy it is recorded that Fattimah Zohr\u00e2\u2014s. t. h.\u2014had four children, namely, the Em\u00e2ms Hasan and Husayn, Zaynab, and Omm Kalth\u00fbm. Zaynab was married to A\u2019bdullah, the son of Ja\u2019fer Ttayy\u00e2r\u2014A. r. t.\u2014and gave birth to two sons, O\u2019beydullah and A\u2019wun. F\u00e2ri\u00fbq the greater [i.e., the Khalifah O\u2019mar] espoused Omm Kalth\u00fbm during his own reign, and begat with her a son, Zayd by name. After the demise of O\u2019mar the Commander of the Faithful\u2014A. r. h.\u2014A\u2019wun, the son of Ja\u2019fer, married her, and after he had also died Muhammad, another son of Ja\u2019fer, married her, and had a daughter by her. When Muhammad had likewise departed to the eternal world, A\u2019bdullah, yet another son of Ja\u2019fer, married Omm Kalth\u00fbm and she died in his house.\n\nAccording to a tradition of Ebn Esah\u00e2q and Lyth B. Sa\u2019d, Fattimah\u2014s. t. h.\u2014had two other children, namely, Hasan and Raqyah, both of whom died in infancy. It is recorded in the *Raudzatu-l-\u00e2hb\u00e2b* that neither Zaynab nor Omm Kalth\u00fbm left any offspring at all, and that therefore the descendants of the seal of prophets are all the progeny of the Em\u00e2ms Hasan and Husayn\u2014salutation to our prophet and to both of them, as well as to all the pure Em\u00e2ms our guides, the Khalifahs and directors; abundant and consecutive salutations to them till the day of the resurrection.\n\n**Names of the Amanuenses of the Seal of Prophecy\u2014**\n\nB., etc.\n\nIn the *Raudzatu-l-\u00e2hb\u00e2b* it is recorded that the amanuenses of the prophet\u2014b., etc.\u2014were four in number, as follows: A\u2019li B. Abu T\u2019t\u00e2leb, and O\u2019thm\u00e2n B. U\u2019ff\u00e2n, and Abu B. Ka\u2019b, and Zayd B. Th\u00e2bet. The arrangement was that O\u2019thm\u00e2n the Commander of the Faithful and the king of men [i.e., Ali] used to write, and that any errors committed by them were rectified by Abu B. Ka\u2019b when arranging the verses [of the Qur\u00e2\u00ee]. When none of the four men were present in the august assembly, any companion who happened to be near wrote [from the dictation\nof the prophet]. Zobayr B. Ala\u2019ww\u00e2m and Jahym B. Assillat\u2014A. r. t.\u2014were appointed to keep accounts of the goods of the Ssadaq\u00e2t, always writing down also when the Dzak\u00e2t was received, and for what purpose it was expended. Khodyfah B. Alym\u00e2n registered contingent receipts, Moghyrah B. Sha\u2019bah and Hussyn B. Nomyr were appointed to note down business transactions, while A\u2019bdullah B. Arqum kept correspondence with kings, and the king of saints [A\u2019li] wrote treaties of peace.
