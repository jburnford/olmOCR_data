Immense strides have been made within the present century in these branches of learning; Sanskrit has been brought within the range of accurate philology, and its invaluable ancient literature thoroughly investigated; the language and sacred books of the Zoroastrians have been laid bare; Egyptian, Assyrian, and other records of the remote past have been deciphered, and a group of scholars speak of still more recondite Accadian and Hittite monuments; but the results of all the scholarship that has been devoted to these subjects have been almost inaccessible to the public because they were contained for the most part in learned or expensive works, or scattered throughout the numbers of scientific periodicals. Messrs. TR\u00dcBNER & Co., in a spirit of enterprise which does them infinite credit, have determined to supply the constantly-increasing want, and to give in a popular, or, at least, a comprehensive form, all this mass of knowledge to the world.\"\u2014Times.\n\nNew Edition in preparation,\n\nPost 8vo, with Map,\n\nTHE INDIAN EMPIRE: ITS HISTORY, PEOPLE, AND PRODUCTS.\n\nBeing a revised form of the article \"India,\" in the \"Imperial Gazetteer,\" remodelled into chapters, brought up to date, and incorporating the general results of the Census of 1881.\n\nBy the Hon.

The students of Pali who possess Faub\u00f6ll's text, or either of the above named translations, will therefore needs want Mr. Beal's English rendering of the Chinese version; the thirteen above-named additional sections not being accessible to them in any other form; for, even if they understand Chinese, the Chinese original would be unobtainable by them.\n\n\"Mr. Beal's rendering of the Chinese translation is a most valuable aid to the critical study of the work. It contains authentic texts gathered from ancient canonical books, and generally connected with some incident in the history of Buddha. Their great interest, however, consists in the light which they throw upon everyday life in India at the remote period at which they were written, and upon the method of teaching adopted by the founder of the religion. The method employed was principally parable, and the simplicity of the tales and the excellence of the morals inculcated, as well as the strange hold which they have retained upon the minds of millions of people, make them a very remarkable study.\"\u2014Times.\n\n\"Mr. Beal, by making it accessible in an English dress, has added to the great services he has already rendered to the comparative study of religious history.\"\u2014Academy.\n\n\"Valuable as exhibiting the doctrine of the Buddhists in its purest, least adulterated form, it brings the modern reader face to face with that simple creed and rule of conduct which won its way over the minds of myriads, and which is now nominally professed by 145 millions, who have overlaid its austere simplicity with innumerable ceremonies, forgotten its maxims, perverted its teaching, and so inverted its leading principle that a religion whose founder denied a God, now worships that founder as a god himself.\"\u2014Soulsearcher.\nTHE HISTORY OF INDIAN LITERATURE.\n\nBY ALBRECHT WEBER.\n\nTranslated from the Second German Edition by JOHN MANN, M.A., and THEODOR ZACHARIAE, Ph.D., with the sanction of the Author.\n\nDr. Buhler, Inspector of Schools in India, writes:\u2014\"When I was Professor of Oriental Languages in Elphinstone College, I frequently felt the want of such a work to which I could refer the students.\"\n\nProfessor Cowell, of Cambridge, writes:\u2014\"It will be especially useful to the students in our Indian colleges and universities.

It attracted much notice when it first appeared, and is generally admitted to present the best summary extant of the vast subject with which it deals.\"\u2014Tablet.\n\n\"This is not only on the whole the best but the only manual of the religions of India, apart from Buddhism, which we have in English. The present work... shows not only great knowledge of the facts and power of clear exposition, but also great insight into the inner history and the deeper meaning of the great religion, for it is in reality only one, which it proposes to describe.\"\u2014Modern Review.\n\n\"The merit of the work has been emphatically recognised by the most authoritative Orientalists, both in this country and on the continent of Europe. But probably there are few Indianists (if we may use the word) who would not derive a good deal of information from it, and especially from the extensive bibliography provided in the notes.\"\u2014Dublin Review.\n\n\"Such a sketch M.

In the preface he states that the system of Kapila is the 'earliest attempt on record to give an answer, from reason alone, to the mysterious questions which arise in every thoughtful mind about the origin of the world, the nature and relations of man and his future destiny,' and in his learned and able notes he exhibits 'the connection of the Sankhya system with the philosophy of Spinoza,' and 'the connection of the system of Kapila with that of Schopenhauer and Von Hartmann.'\"\u2014Foreign Church Chronicle.\n\n\"Mr. Davies's volume on Hindu Philosophy is an undoubted gain to all students of the development of thought. The system of Kapila, which is here given in a translation from the Sankhya K\u0101rika, is the only contribution of India to pure philosophy... Presents many points of deep interest to the student of comparative philosophy, and without Mr. Davies's lucid interpretation it would be difficult to appreciate these points in any adequate manner.\"\u2014Saturday Review.\n\n\"We welcome Mr. Davies's book as a valuable addition to our philosophical library.\"\u2014Notes and Queries.\nA MANUAL OF HINDU PANTHEISM. VED\u00c2NTAS\u00c2RA.\n\nTranslated, with copious Annotations, by MAJOR G. A. JACOB,\nBombay Staff Corps; Inspector of Army Schools.\n\nThe design of this little work is to provide for missionaries, and for others who, like them, have little leisure for original research, an accurate summary of the doctrines of the Ved\u00e2nta.\n\n\"There can be no question that the religious doctrines most widely held by the people of India are mainly Pantheistic. And of Hindu Pantheism, at all events in its most modern phases, its Ved\u00e2ntas\u00e2ra presents the best summary. But then this work is a mere summary: a skeleton, the dry bones of which require to be clothed with skin and bones, and to be animated by vital breath before the ordinary reader will discern in it a living reality. Major Jacob, therefore, has wisely added to his translation of the Ved\u00e2ntas\u00e2ra copious notes from the writings of well-known Oriental scholars, in which he has, we think, elucidated all that required elucidation. So that the work, as here presented to us, presents no difficulties which a very moderate amount of application will not overcome.\"\u2014Tudt.\n\n\"The modest title of Major Jacob's work conveys but an inadequate idea of the vast amount of research embodied in his notes to the text of the Ved\u00e2ntas\u00e2ra. So copious, indeed, are these, and so much collateral matter do they bring to bear on the subject, that the diligent student will rise from their perusal with a fairly adequate view of Hindu philosophy generally.

Both attain to the same size, have in common the shape of the body, the white marks of the face, and the general distribution of colours. In the adult of the present species the prevailing colours are clear ashy-grey above and white below. On either parietal bone the hairs form a whorl, and the anterior are directed forward, projecting beyond the eyebrows. The two whorls are distinct in the young, though the hairs of the head are too short to mingle with the long, erect, divergent black hairs of the eyebrows. Just below the spot where the two whorls come in contact the skull is naked, thus forming a rather broad, triangular forehead. The general colour of\n\nas it has been supposed, refer to that species. His short description indicates S. obscurus (Lotong), the most common species in both islands. Sir S. Raffles evidently did not describe the living animal, or he would not have omitted one of the most striking characters\u2014viz., the white marks of the face, which in preserved specimens become obliterated, so that the face appears uniformly black. The omission of this character by Sir S. Raffles, and subsequently by later describers of this species, has given rise to confusion.\n\n* Schinz repeats S. femoralis, Martin, as a syn. for S. sumatranus, and says in a note that M\u00fcller, in his monograph of Semnopithecus, refers that species to his S. sumatranus (Schinz, Syn. Mam. i. p. 39, not 2). Were even the two identical, the species should not have been re-named, as S. femoralis, Horfield, not Martin, would take precedence, being the denomination under which Dr. Horfield described it in the \"Appendix to the Life of Sir T. Stamford Raffles.\" 1830.\n\n\u2020 Martin, p. 481, refers the young S. dorsatus to S. femoralis, but the description is that of the young of the present species.\nS. obscurus, both in the young and adult state, is considerably darker. On the upper parts a blackish or brownish ash colour prevails, lighter below, which acquires in some individuals a whitish appearance from the white skin of the stomach, which is but scantily covered with hairs. Of parietal whorls there is no trace; the hairs of the head, directed backwards, originate in a peak as far down as the glabella, and are smoothed down on the top of the head from the occipital crest backward.\n\nSemnopithecus cristatus, Horsfield.\n\nSyn.\u2014Simia cristata, Chingkau, Raffles.\nSemnopithecus pruinosus, Desmarest.\nSemnopithecus pruinosus, apud Lesson.\nSemnopithecus cristatus, apud Martin.\nPresbytes cristata, Gray.* List.\nSemnopithecus cristatus, apud Schinz.*\n\nHab.\u2014Pinang, Malayan Peninsula.\nSumatra, Borneo, Banka.\n\nThe whitish colour round the eyes and mouth is present, though less distinct in this than in the preceding two species.\n\nSemnopithecus femoralis, Horsfield.\n\nSyn.\u2014Semnopithecus chrysomelas, M\u00fcller apud Martin and Schinz.\n\nHab.\u2014Purlis (on the Malayan Peninsula).\nBorneo, Java (?), Sumatra (?).\n\nIn a young male of this apparently everywhere difficultly procurable species the face during life was intense black, except the white-haired lips and the chin, which were of a milk-white colour. In the preserved specimen the latter soon changed into the dull brownish-black of the rest of the face. The interdigital membrane, often loosely connecting the first phalanges of the four fingers and toes in S. obscurus, albocinereus, cristatus, and other Malayan monkeys, was also present in this individual, in which even the first and second phalanges of the index and middle toe were thus connected. In preserved specimens the interdigital web becomes shrivelled and indistinct, and therefore, being at all times a very questionable if not altogether inadmissible specific character, ought in such state to be least relied upon. On its arrival at Pinang the animal was in too sickly a state to allow of its natural habits being observed.\n\n* Gray quotes S. maurus, Horsfield, and Schinz S. femoralis, Martin, as synonyms, both of which are species\u2014in physiognomy, colours, and, as far as S. maurus is concerned, in habits, distinctly different from the present one.\nGen.

The white spots on the back of the anterior extremities appear to be constant in every age. Though there are four mammae situate in pairs one above the other close to the axilla of a number of females with young, none had more than one offspring, which was carried wrapped in the wide mantle-like membrane. In several shot on the hills at Pinang the stomach contained vegetable matter, but no remains of insects. In confinement, plantains constitute the favourite food, but deprived of liberty the animal soon pines and dies. The anterior margin of the broad smooth tongue has a fringed appearance, produced by a number of rounded papill\u00e6.

The rest of the lower parts are either white or brownish-white. The flying membrane in the adult male is whitish; in the females and young males it is blackish or brownish between the legs, along the sides of the body, and the arms. The colour of the female and young male is on the back of a more or less brownish mouse-grey, becoming much lighter or whitish beneath, but both are destitute of the black beard, which, out of a number of between forty and fifty from different Malayan localities, occurred but in seven males, although some of the beardless males, in size and extent of flying membrane, equalled or even slightly exceeded the bearded. The entire length of the largest male was four inches, of which the tail measured one inch; extent of flying membrane, fifteen and four-eighth inches.\n\nDentition:\u2014\n\nIncis. \\(\\frac{0}{4}\\); Canin. \\(\\frac{1-1}{1-1}\\); Mol. \\(\\frac{4-4}{5-5}\\)\nTaphozous saccolaimus, Temminck.\n\nSyn.\u2014Taphozous pulcher, Elliot MSS. apud Blyth.\nHab.\u2014Pinang.\nJava, Sumatra, Borneo, Celebes, Southern India.\n\nIn two males captured at Pinang, in houses in the valley, the colours somewhat differ from Temminck's description, quoted by Schinz. In the larger, the head and back are of a sooty black, with a few white dashes, the lower parts of a pure white. The flying membrane is black between the legs, along the sides of the body and the arms, and between the index, second, and third fingers; the rest being dull, semi-transparent white. The length from the apex of the nose to the posterior margin of the interfemoral margin is four and seven-eighth inches, of which the tail measures one inch; the extent of the flying membrane eighteen inches. Dentition as in T. melanogogon. The smaller differs in having the chest of a pale brownish white, the abdomen and the pubes light rust-coloured, leaving the sides pure white. Mr. Blyth quotes Taphozous pulcher, Elliot, from Southern India, as being \"black brown above with white pencillings, and pure white below\" (\"Journ. As. Soc.\" xiii. 1844, p. 492), from which, as well as from Mr. Elliot's specimen, at present in the Museum of the Asiatic Society, it appears that the Indian more resemble the Malayan individuals than those of the Indian Archipelago, described by Temminck.

Individuals occur of a light golden-brown, in colours resembling Rhinolophus larvatus, Horsfield. In the adult male the livid flesh-coloured nasal appendage is larger, more complicated, and somewhat different from the figure given by Geoffroy St. Hilaire (\"Ann. du Mus\u00e9um,\" xx. pl. 5 and 6), which resembles the female in the simpler appendage and the absence of the frontal pore. The latter organ in the adult male is large, secreting a yellowish-brown oily fluid, the odour of which resembles that of Arctictis Binturong, Fischer. A female during lactation presented a great inequality in the development of the inguinal warts, of which the right measured one-quarter of an inch in length. At the time of her capture it was reported that a young one had been \"sucking\" the right wart. Not having myself observed the young clinging to that organ, I cannot vouch for the correctness of a statement which, if authentic, would tend to explain the use, being to afford support to the young when not sucking. The size of the Malayan individuals appears to exceed those from Timor, the entire length of the former being five and six-eighth inches, of which the tail measures two inches. Extent of the flying membrane, twenty-one and a half to twenty-two inches. The extremity of the second phalanx of the fourth and fifth fingers is bifid, or terminating with two minute diverging joints, a structure also existing in the Malayan individuals of the following species:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Incis. } \\frac{2}{4}; \\quad \\text{Canin. } \\frac{1-1}{1-1}; \\quad \\text{Mol. } \\frac{5-5}{5-5}\n\\]\n\nHIPPOSIDEROS NOBILIS, Gray.\n\nSYN.\u2014Rhinolophus nobilis, Horsfield.\nRhinolophus nobilis, apud Fischer.\nRhinolophe fameux, Temminck.\nRhinolophus nobilis, apud Schinz.\nHAB.\u2014Pinang, Malayan Peninsula.\nJava, Sumatra, Timor, Amboyna.\n\nThe frontal pore is less developed than in the former species,\nas compared with which the present is of a more slender form, though of a size little less inferior.

The latter are sub-erect, broader than long, their breadth equalling the length of the head; the shape is broad, pyriform, narrowing towards the apex, which appears like a small artificially-rounded flap, scarcely elevated above the level of the fur covering the vertex. More than two-thirds of the back of the ear is covered with fur, leaving a narrow naked line along the external margin, which, as well as the singular shape of the ear itself, affords a distinguishing character. The hairs are buff or whitish at the base, the other half of their length brown. The general colour of the upper parts is deep brown, with a slight reddish hue, becoming a shade lighter beneath.\n\nThis species somewhat resembles *Hipposideros apiculatus*, Gray (*Vespertilio speoris*, Schneider apud Schreber; *Rhinolophus speoris*, Geoffroy), from which, however, it differs in the absence of the frontal pore, in the shape of the ears, and in colours.

In a state of nature it lives singly or in pairs, fiercely attacking intruders of its own species. When several are confined together they fight each other, or jointly attack and destroy the weakest. The natural food is mixed insectivorous and frugivorous. In confinement individuals may be fed exclusively on either, though preference is evinced for insects; and eggs, fish, and earth-worms are equally relished. A short peculiar tremulous whistling sound, often heard by calls and answers in the Malayan jungle, marks their pleasurable emotions, as, for instance, on the appearance of food; while the contrary is expressed by shrill protracted cries. Their disposition is very restless, and their great agility enables them to perform the most extraordinary bounds in all directions, in which exercise they spend the day, till night sends them to sleep in their rudely constructed lairs in the highest branches of trees. At times they will sit on their haunches, holding their food between the fore-legs, and after feeding they smooth the head and face with both fore-paws, and lick the lips.\n\n* Vol. ii. p. 458, pl. xiii. The explanation accompanying this figure is as follows:\u2014\u201cSearching for Col. Farquhar\u2019s drawing of Rhizomys Sumatranus, already referred to, I found in the Society a drawing of a bushy-tailed Herpestes, differing merely from Mr. Hodgson\u2019s Gulo Urva in having the tail of one uniform colour with the body, without the yellow tip. There is no name or letter on the drawing to show from whence it came, and to prevent its following the fate of Colonel Farquhar\u2019s Rhizomys we here afford a copy of it.\u201d Pl. xiii represents no Herpestes: the elongated muzzle, the proximity of the large eye to the ear, which is exposed and not hidden by the hairs of the cheek, are characters foreign to every known species of Herpestes. The draughtsman has very correctly represented a Tupai, and the drawing reappearing as a Herpestes in the \u201cCalcutta Journal of Natural History\u201d has by Mr. Blyth been traced to be the original of pl. ix., \u201cAsiatic Researches,\u201d vol. xiv., where it properly accompanies the description of Sorex Glis (i.e., Tupai ferruginea) of MM. Diard and Duvaucel.\nand palms. They are also fond of water, both to drink and to bathe in. The female usually produces one young; she has four mammae, the anterior pair of which is situated on the lower lateral part of the chest, the posterior on the side of the abdomen. On the lower surface of the tongue the frenum is continued to within a short distance of the apex in a raised line, on either side of which the skin is thickened, fringed at the edges, and thus presenting a rudimentary sublingual appendage, somewhat similar to that observed in *Nycticebus tardigradus*, though in *Tupaia ferruginea* the fringes of the margin only are free, the rest being attached to the tongue, but easily detached by a knife. The lateral raised lines of the palms and soles, the posterior part of the first phalanges, and the third phalanx (second of the thumbs), which is widened into a small soft disc\u2014in fact, all the points which rest upon the ground\u2014are studded with little transversely curved ridges or duplicatures, similar to those observed under the toes of some of the *Gekkotidae*, which fully account for the precision, the *aplomb*, with which these animals perform the astounding leaps from below, barely touching with the soles the *point d'appui* above. In a cage the tupai will continue for hours vaulting from below, back downwards, poise itself for an instant, continuing back downwards under the horizontal roof, and regain the point of starting, and thus describe a circle\u2014the diameter of which may be three to four times the length of the animal\u2014in far shorter time than is required for the description.

Sir Stamford Raffles, who published the first account of this animal, distinctly states that it was discovered at Malacca (not Java, as erroneously stated) by Major Farquhar, and Malacca is situated on the continent of India as well as Tenasserim. The fact of its inhabiting Bhotan was, according to Cuvier (\u201cR\u00e8gne Animal\u201d), first made known by Duvaucel; and the author of the article \u201cIctides\u201d in the \u201cPenny Cyclopaedia,\u201d 1838, gives Mr. Hodgson\u2019s authority of the Binturong inhabiting Nipal (Kachar, though they occasionally occur in the central region of Nipal).\nmarked, which communicates to these parts a whitish or greyish appearance. In the young of either sex there is a faint trace of a white spot over the eyes. The long ear-tufts are always black, the margin of the auricle being either white or pale rust-coloured. The tail is black, but the hairs of the anterior or basal half are whitish at the root, or in some uniformly of that colour. The pupil is vertically contracted by the influence of light: the iris is of a beautiful Vandyke brown. In its habits the Binturong is both arboreal and terrestrial, and nocturnal, sleeping until the sun is below the horizon, when it displays great agility in searching for smaller quadrupeds, birds, fishes, earthworms, insects, and fruit. The howl is loud, resembling some of the Malayan Paradoxuri. The young are easily tamed, but the old animal retains its natural fierceness. Between the anus and penis is situated a large pyriform gland, exceeding two inches in length, partially divided by a deep naked fossa, commencing from the latter organ. The gland secretes a light brown oily fluid of a peculiarly intense but not foetid or sickening odour. In a young male, measuring from the nose to the root of the tail two feet three and five-eighth inches, the tail two feet two and a half inches, the intestines were of the following dimensions:\n\nSmall intestines . . . . . 7 feet 11 inches.\nLarge ditto . . . . . 1 ,, 10 ,, \nC\u00e6cum . . . . . . . 0 ,, 0\u00bd ,, \n\nThe circumference of the small intestines about seven-eighth inches; of the large but little more; but the rectum was thickened two inches in circumference.\n\nThe short c\u00e6cum is crescent-shaped or lengthened pyriform.

Its voice is a short shrill whistling, not unlike the sound of the cricket, but stronger. Its food is not confined to fishes and crustacea; birds and insects are equally relished. The muzzle is hairy, but in the old animal the hairs become rubbed off. The Malayan individuals appear to attain to a greater size than the Sumatran, described by Raffles. An old male measured from the apex of the nose to the root of the tail two feet eight and a half inches; the tail one foot eight inches. In a young male two feet two inches, and the tail one foot two-eighth of an inch in length, the simple intestinal canal measured nine feet and one inch, with a circumference throughout of about two and two-eighth inches.

Colonel Sykes, on the contrary, describes C. Dukhunensis as being \"essentially distinct from Canis Quao, or Sumatrensis, Hardwicke.\"\nSome slight differences occur in the Malayan individuals. The inferior surface, the inside of the ears and limbs, and the lips and throat are the same colour as the back, but much paler. A black carpal spot, like that of the wolf, is very distinct in the male, less so in the female. The young animal of either sex has a faint white spot with a few blackish bristles situated nearly midway between the angle of the mouth and the ears. Of the wavy wool of the Buansu, the Malayan wild dog, inhabiting a tropical climate, has but a little on the inner side of and immediately behind the ear; the posterior part of the abdomen is almost naked. The short bristles of the lips, cheeks, throat, and above the eyes are all black. In habits, so fully described by Mr. Hodgson, and in size, the Malayan agrees with the Nipalese. In a young male, from the nose to the root of the tail two feet eight and a half inches in length, the tail one foot, the intestinal canal was of the following dimensions:\n\nSmall intestines . . . . . . . . . . 6 feet 2 inches.\nLarge ditto . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 1/2 \"\nC\u00e6cum . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 \"\n\nThe latter intestine is spiral, much widened at the origin.\n\nCost\u00e6 verte, 8 pairs; spuri\u00e6, 5 pairs = 13 pairs.\n\nThe Malays mention another black wild dog (Anjing \u00fatan \u00e9tam) as also inhabiting the denses, jungle. A hy\u00e6na is also reported to occur on the peninsula.\n\nMongrel curs, \"pariah dogs,\" of every description, infest every village, but apparently not uninhabited places, nor localities far distant from the dwellings of man. As they all may be said to be in a state of half-domestication, and are of forms very different from the wild dog, which shuns the human presence, their origin cannot with certainty be traced to the Malayan Peninsula.\n\nGen.

Zool. Society,\u201d 1832, p. 63). The number and distance of the half-rings on the lower surface of the tail vary in different individuals, some of which have either the entire tail or the anterior half or third of the tail thus marked, the rest being black. The very young animal is generally of a much darker ground colour than the adult, and the black marks are therefore less conspicuous. Under certain lights the colour appears uniformly black. *Viverra tangalunga* and *zibetha*, however similar in habits and general colours, neither live nor breed together. Placed side by side, the living animals present a marked dissimilarity of countenance, which, although obvious to the eye, would be most difficult, if possible at all, to convey in words. The female has three pairs of mammae, and produces from one to three young. The Malays of the peninsula distinguish by different names the *zibetha* and the *tangalunga*, but as they suppose the civet of the former species to be of better quality, perhaps because it is scarcer, they will frequently offer for sale individuals of the latter exceedingly numerous species, imposing upon it the name of *V. zibetha*\u2014\u201cTanggallong\u201d of the Peninsula.

It was unknown to himself and to the natives. At first the animal was fierce and impatient of confinement, but by degrees it became very gentle and playful, and when subsequently suffered to leave the cage, it went in search of sparrows and other small birds, displaying great dexterity and unerring aim in stealthily leaping upon them.

In most the dorsal marks become indistinct or invisible in certain lights. The female has from one to three young, of colours similar to the adult, but less distinct; their fur is softer, somewhat woolly, mixed with longer stiff black hairs. The young is tamed without difficulty, and is sometimes kept in houses to destroy rats and mice. The Paradoxuri are in habits like the Civets. They have an elliptical pupil, vertically contracted by the influence of light. Their glandular secretion is of a peculiar (not civet or musk-like) odour.

The species is apparently not numerous, and is celebrated among the Malays for its great agility. It is said chiefly to feed upon the larger birds, such as the Argus pheasant, which it will hunt down, following its prey till the strength of the latter is exhausted, when it falls an easy victim to the indefatigable pursuer. The slender vermiform make, the countenance and distribution of colours, the serrated, flattened false molars, the soles, hairy between and under the toes, and slightly in the centre, the somewhat removed thumb, are characters by which this animal differs from Paradoxurus, and forms a link between that genus and Prionodon in the same manner that Viverricula connects Viverra to Prionodon.

In none of the Malayan wild cats is the length of the tail more variable. In a male, measuring from the apex of the nose to the root of the tail two feet one and a half inch, the tail, consisting of twelve gradually diminishing caudal vertebrae, measured five and a half inches; in another, one foot ten and three-fourth inch in length from the nose to the root of the tail, the latter organ measured two inches, consisting of four slightly decreasing vertebrae, the last one of which was broad, flattened, and rounded at the posterior extremity.

As observed by Sir S. Raffles, some of the Malayan, like the Madagascar domesticated cats, have a short twisted or knobbed tail, others are tailless. Among those of an uniform colour, a light ashy and a bluish (or slaty-grey) variety, with single longer black hairs on the back and tail, are conspicuous.

The mustachios, whiskers, and the superciliary bristles are black; those of the throat and forearm are black in some, ferruginous, or with the apex of that colour, in others. The underparts vary from a deep golden fulvous to isabella colour. Whatever be the prevailing shade, it is always most distinct on the lateral line, which, commencing from the cheeks, passes along the sides of the body. The fur of the lower parts of the body and of the inside of the extremities is much shorter, softer, and less dense than that of the back. The single hairs are greyish or blackish at the root, with the apex of the shade of yellow prevailing in the individual. Single low bristles, either uniformly or partially black or fulvous, appear on the chest and abdomen. The species, under the present garb, is very numerous in the Malayan forests and hills.\n\nVar. \u03b2, Horsfield.\n\n\"Sciurus supra fuscus, varians a fusco-nigricante ad sordide fulvum, pilis velleris fulvis et canescentibus intermixtis, subtus fulvus vel pallide flavescens.\" (Horsfield.)\n\nSYN.\u2014Sciurus auriventer, Is.

In some the head is of a darker colour, in others large spots of dark appear on the back, or the tail is above barred with black. The upper part of the nose, a ring encircling the eyes, and the ears appear in all individuals to be of a darker brownish colour, and all have a more or less distinct large white spot on the anterior and upper part of the thigh. The back of the feet is either dark brown or fulvous. The palms, soles, mammae, and genital organs are black in all. The single hairs of the back are greyish-brown at the root, darker than the apex, which imparts the general colour to the back. With the hairs of the tail the reverse is the case, the basal half being isabella or white; the apical darker. On the lower surface of the distichous tail the roots of the hairs form a white line on either side of the vertebrae, which are covered with short dark brownish or fulvous hairs. The under-parts of the body are of the same colours as those of the black-coated animal, but their roots are yellowish-white. The mustachios, whiskers, and other bristles, are in all of a blackish-brown; but the single bristles of the abdomen are sometimes fulvous.\n\nThe black-coated individuals stand in a similar relation to the light-coloured varieties as that in which the black-coloured\nHylobates Lar stands to the light-coloured. Such differences of colour, wide no doubt, are of no uncommon occurrence among the Malayan Mammalia, and ought to be well considered by zoologists who have not the opportunity of studying the living animals.\n\nThis, as well as the rest of the Malayan squirrels, is capable of being tamed to a certain extent, and evinces attachment to those who feed them, but the appearance of a strange person, animal, or even an unusual sound, startles them, and recalls their natural shyness.

(Sciurus rufogularis, Gray: \"Mag. Nat. Hist.\" 1842, p. 263)\n\nThe cheeks are sometimes dark brown, or ferruginous.\n\n* China is the habitat assigned to Sciurus rufogularis, Gray. Without doubting the authenticity, it is perhaps as well to observe that skins of the more showy animals and birds of India, Malacca, and the Indian Archipelago, are offered for sale as indigenous productions in the shops of Canton and Macao. Skins of Halcyon Smyrnensis, for instance, and other birds from different parts of India, are bought up by the Chinese merchants of our colonies in the Straits of Malacca, who annually, on Chinese junks, ship quantities of considerable value to China, where they are manufactured into fans and artificial flowers. In a list of birds contained in a collection of Chinese productions exhibited in London in 1842, Mr. H. E. Strickland observes, in his communication to the Zoological Society, that some of them appear to have been imported from Malacca. Skins and other parts of a host of animals, from the most distant parts of Asia, form items in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. On my visits to Chinese dispensaries in China and in our Malayan colonies I have been shown horns of rhinoceroses and deer, tusks of the Dugong, heads of Buceri, tortoise-shells, and well-preserved skins of Trigonoccephalus Blomhoffii, from Japan; ammonites and other fossils, cum multis aliis, all supposed to possess specific virtues, and accordingly prescribed by Chinese medical practitioners.\nIn some the white lateral line commences from the side of the nose, passing over the cheeks, the sides of the neck, and over the shoulder. The lateral line is either pure white, more or less distinct, or mixed with single longer hairs with black apex.\n\nSome have a short black line immediately below the white; in others there is above the latter a grizzled line, sometimes continued over the outside of the thigh. The tail is seldom uniformly black, frequently partially black, reddish, or grizzled, owing to the apex of the hairs being white. The tuft is frequently reddish or rust-coloured.\n\nThe feet are sometimes white or pale ferruginous.\n\nThe Museum of the Asiatic Society possesses a specimen from Java, differing from *Sciurus rufoniger*, Gray, in having the tail grizzled instead of black. *Sciurus redimitus*, Van de Boon, is probably another variety of *S. Rafflesii*.\n\nA young male, about a fortnight in confinement, after having finished his usual meal of cocoanut, seized and devoured an *Iora typhia*, which had just been shot and happened to be placed within reach.

Jaarg. i. Aflev. p. 87), in having neither the first nor the fifth molar of the upper jaw very large. Both are of nearly equal size, and much smaller than the rest. The following is a description of the Malayan animal.\n\n* In the \"List of Mammalia in the British Museum\" occurs a genus, Rhinosciurus, Gray, and a species R. tupaioides, Gray, syn. Sciurus laticaudatus, M\u00fcller? Generic or specific characters being neither given nor referred to, it is impossible in India to decide whether the specimen in the British Museum thus labelled is identical with the animal here characterized.\nThe shape of the head is depressed, elongated, conical, gradually attenuated towards the laterally compressed nose. The whole outline, the slender form, and general colours, render the animal strikingly similar to *Tupaia ferruginea*. The eyes are large, brilliant, dark; the ears large, oval, with smooth short hairs; the mouth is small, the upper incisors are very minute, the lower slender, flattened, and almost straight; the black mustachios, whiskers, superciliary and gular bristles, and the few white ones of the forearm, are all shorter than the head; the muzzle hairy, leaving the margins of the small, and at the apex laterally pierced, nostrils naked. The limbs and feet slender; the nailless tubercle of the thumb rudimentary, barely perceptible in the living animal. The claws are small, sharp, compressed, whitish.\n\nThe colour of the head, back, outside of the limbs and feet, is a rich rusty red, mixed with shining black, particularly on the occiput, the back and the feet, less on the sides, where the ferruginous prevails; the throat, chest, abdomen, and inner side of the limbs, whitish; in some individuals pale yellowish. The fur is soft and delicate. The separate hairs are leaden-grey at the base, shining black, or with a broad subterminal ferruginous band. The tail is shorter than the body, distichous, broadest in the middle, attenuated at the root, terminating in a thin tuft. It may be compared to a feather, black on each side of the quill, successively ferruginous, again black, margined with buff. Such is the succession of the bands on the separate hairs. This organ is less full and ornamental than in the generality of squirrels. The species is apparently not numerous; the largest out of five examined, a female, was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength from the apex of the nose to the root of the tail 10\\(\\frac{6}{8}\\) inches.\n\" of the tail 6\\(\\frac{4}{8}\\)\" \"\n\" of the head 2\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\)\" \"\n\" from the apex of the nose to the anterior angle of the eye 1\\(\\frac{2}{8}\\)\" inch.\n\" from the posterior angle of the eye to the ear 0\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\)\" \"\nBreadth above the apex of the nose 0\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)\" \"\n\" between the anterior angles of the eyes 0\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\)\" \"\n\" between the ears 0\\(\\frac{6}{8}\\)\" \"\nDiameter of the head at vertex 1\" \"\n\nIts habits in confinement presented nothing remarkable.\n\n*Gen.

The shade and intensity of the red colour is liable to considerable variations.* In the very young there is a short black stripe behind the ears; and the posterior part of the back and anterior half of the tail are shining black, from each separate hair having the apex of that colour. Traces of these characters occur in some adult individuals. This species is very numerous in the Malayan countries. It is not strictly nocturnal, for it is frequently seen abroad during the day. It is particularly fond of the Durian, the fruit of Durio Zibethinus, Linn\u00e9. The flying squirrel has this partiality in common with various other animals, as monkeys, Pteropi and Paradoxuri; nay, the Malays assert that they have to watch this their favourite fruit against tigers.\n\nIn a female, measuring from the extremity of the nose to the root of the tail one foot six and a half inches, the tail one foot nine inches, the intestinal canal was of the following dimensions:\n\n| Small intestines | 7 feet 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches. |\n|------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Large            | 5 \u201e 2 \u201e                        |\n| C\u00e6cum            | 2 \u201e 4 \u201e                        |\n\nSciuropterus, Fred.

Hist.,\" vol. ii. p. 450, pl. xiv., states: \"There are four toes to each fore-foot, and five to each hind-foot.\" The draughtsman of pl. xiv., Rhizomys cinereus, has at all events observed that all the feet are five-toed; however incorrectly he has represented the animal. Another error occurs in the description\u2014viz., \"Sir Stamford Raffles describes a species of bamboo rat found in Sumatra by Colonel Farquhar,\" &c. Sir S. Raffles' words are these:\u2014\"Mus sumatrensis.\u2014A drawing and specimen of an animal which appears related to the Mus Pilocides was forwarded from Malacca\"\u2014not Sumatra, as erroneously asserted\u2014\"by Major Farquhar, to the Asiatic Society, at the same time with the Binturong.

Society,\" vol. xiii. part ii.)\nstates that it was forwarded from Malacca by Major Farquhar; nor does it appear to inhabit Sumatra, although the specific name would lead one to suppose that such is the case. The colour of the adult is liable to individual variations, from grey of different shades to isabella or silvery-buff. The separate hairs are mostly of the colour prevailing in the individual, mixed with single dark-brown hairs with whitish apex, particularly on the vertex, continuing along the centre part of the back. On the nose, anterior part of the head, and on the cheeks, the hairs are of a pale rust colour. On the vertex some white hairs from either a spot or a short line of that colour. The scanty hairs of the abdomen are all of a pale greyish or isabella colour. The mustachios, whiskers, superciliar and gular bristles are either of a pale brown or buff colour. The young are above of a dark grey, with a brown streak on the vertex and back; beneath, pale grey. The forehead, nose, temples, and cheeks are ferruginous. The adult, like some squirrels and rats, is subject to enlargement of the scrotum. In confinement it is very savage, scarcely tameable. The length of the tail varies from about one-third to little more than one-fourth of the length of the body. It is blackish or brownish; the apex whitish. The largest male examined measured from the apex of the nose to the root of the tail one foot seven and a half inches; the tail five and a half inches. The female, in size and colours equalling the male, has ten mammae\u2014viz., two axillary and three inguinal pairs.\n\nGen.

The figure also has a few mane-like long bristles on the head, whereas the mustachios are situated on the side of the nose, the whiskers below the ear, and one or two bristles above the eye. In colours this species resembles Hystrix leucurus, Sykes, from which it differs in the absence of the long mane-like bristles of the head and neck. Although single, scattered, thin, flexible spines, upwards of twelve\n\n* In \"Nachtr\u00e4ge,\" zum 2ten Bande, this species is supposed to be identical with and substituted for Atherura fasciculata, although a very correct description is given of both.\ninches in length, occur on the posterior part of the back, the majority of inflexible spines are much shorter than in *Hystrix leucurus* or *H. cristatus*, and are either pure white or with a blackish band in the medial portion. The short, blackish, slightly iridescent spines of the neck, anterior part of the back, the limbs, and abdomen, are generally grooved on the upper surface. The short white pedunculated tubes of the posterior part of the tail are at first closed, terminating in a short spine, which latter wears off, leaving the tubes open. The pubes are disposed in a wreath of stiff bristles, frequently of a deep rust colour. The epidermis of this species, as well as of *Atherura*, is remarkably thin and liable to be torn. Beneath the skin appears a fatty tissue, upwards of an inch in thickness. The anterior molars are slightly larger than the rest. Viewed from above, *in situ*, the crown of the anterior lower molar of either side presents the form of two letters S facing each other (SS). In a foetus\u2014of which the head measures two and one-eighth inches, the body four and three-eighth inches, the tail one inch in length\u2014the whole of the body and the anterior half of the tail have numerous short hairs, disposed on separate transverse lines of six to eight distant black hairs, becoming longer on the posterior part of the back and sides. The posterior part of the tail has longer and closer hairs. In a female, measuring from the apex of the nose to the root of the tail two feet five inches, the tail four inches, the intestinal canal was of the following dimensions:\n\n- Small intestines . . . . . 21 feet 6 inches.\n- Large \u201d : : : : : 5 \u201d 10 \u201d\n- Caecum . . . . . . . 1 foot 7 \u201d\n\nThe stomach is of a heart-shaped outline, with thin membranes externally smooth, internally with a few longitudinal rugae near the narrow fundus.\n\nThe species is numerous, and as it is considered a delicacy by the Chinese population, is frequently brought to market.\n\n**Gen.

Single longer flexible spines, white with a dark central band, are scattered over the back; the anterior part of the tail is, like the back, covered with flat-grooved spines, white at the root, then slightly iridescent brown, and frequently with white apex; the centre part of the tail is scaly, with very short spines between the scales; the posterior part is white, with white or silvery, flexible, and in length gradually increasing, spines, which Buffon has aptly compared to narrow slips of irregularly cut parchment; the pubes are of a deep rust colour.\n\nThis species is very numerous in the Malayan valleys and hills. In fretful habits and in its food it resembles the preceding porcupine, like which it is carried to the market at Pinang and Malacca, where as many as twenty to thirty may frequently be seen. In a male, measuring from the apex of the nose to the root of the tail one foot ten inches, the tail ten inches, the intestinal canal was of the following dimension:\n\n| Small intestines | 19 feet 4\u00bd inches |\n|------------------|-------------------|\n| Large            | 5 \" 3 \"           |\n| Caecum           | 1 foot 3 \"         |\n\nThe stomach is of a general outline, resembling that of *H. longicauda*, but it differs in having an external deep vertical sulcus, dividing the stomach into a pyloric and a cardiac portion, which latter presents six to seven deep oblique sulci. The membranes of the stomach are thick and muscular. Internally the cardiac portion is transversally divided by six or seven ridges, corresponding to the external sulci, intersected by numerous concentric rugae. The pyloric portion, separated from the cardiac by the rugae produced by the external vertical sulcus, is much smoother and has but few rugae.\n\n* In the figure the anterior foot has one toe too many, the animal having four toes and a rudimentary flat-nailed thumb. Nor is the back of the hind foot naked, unless indeed become so by accident.\nEDENTATA.\n\nGen.

The number of central dorsal vary from twenty to twenty-two; the central and the marginal caudal from twenty-six to twenty-nine: in the young all the scales are finely lineated and the rounded apex only is smooth. With age the lines become obliterated on the exposed surface of the scales, between which appear a few long whitish bristles. The very young animal corresponds to the description of Manis aspera, Sundeval. The eyelids, the margins of the ears, and the scaleless parts, except the palms and soles, are scantily provided with short whitish hairs. The two pectoral mammae are situated at a short distance from the axilla. Its habits present nothing different from those of Manis cassincaudata (M. pendactyla, Linne), of which an interesting account is communicated by Lieut. R. S. Tickell in \"Journal Asiatic Society,\" vol. xi. 1842, p. 221.\n\nThe present species, although numerous in rocky situations, is not often captured, as it is seldom abroad till after sunset. The largest male measured from the apex of the nose to the root of the tail one foot nine and a half inches, the tail one foot eight inches. In a younger male, the entire length of which was one foot eleven inches, the intestinal canal was of the following dimensions:\n\nSmall intestines . . . . . 8 feet 4 inches.\nLarge , , , , , , , , , , 6 ,, ,\n\nCaecum is rudimentary, indicated by a slight yet distinct widening of the intestines. The stomach is capacious, the pyloric region thickened and gizzard-like. On the external surface, where the greater curvature begins to ascend, is situated a small (one inch in length, one and three-eighths in breadth), triangular, externally gyrated, glandular body, firmly attached to the stomach, but not communicating with the cavity. Its external appearance might be compared to that of a crest of ostrich feathers. The narrowed apex, towards the pylorus, is provided with a small, thick, rounded and wrinkled opening, surrounded by concentric fibres, leading\nby a common, short, cylindrical duct to the broader cavity, which latter is divided by two longitudinal parietes into three separate portions. If a tube is introduced into the common duct, the air injected will simultaneously fill all three portions of the cavity, but if the tube is inserted into any one of the three separate portions, the air will fill that particular portion, leaving the two others collapsed. The interior surface of this organ secretes a whitish mucus. Adjoining the common opening, from ten to eleven small rounded glands commence, arranged on a line towards the pylorus. Each gland has in its centre a minute wrinkled opening, leading into a small cavity secreting mucus.\n\nThe stomach was extended by the remains (heads and legs) of a prodigious quantity of large black ants, inhabiting the hills. The contents of the stomach were involved in mucus, deeply tinctured with bile, and among them appeared five small rounded fragments of granite. Another individual expired after ten days' confinement, during which period it took no food, although it was repeatedly placed among swarms of the black and red ants so excessively numerous in the valley of Pinang. Water it always took when offered, lapping it up with the tongue in the same manner that serpents drink.\n\nCoste ver\u00e6, 8 pairs; spuriae, 7 pairs = 15 pairs.

They may be procured at the following rates:\n\n\"For an elephant 4 feet 6 inches high . 120 dollars.\n\" 5 \" 3 \" . 200 \"\n\" 6 \" 0 \" . 220 \"\n\" 6 \" 9 \" . 400 \"\n\" 7 \" 6 \" . 420 \"\n\nThose exceeding this height are paid for at an advance on the last-mentioned rate of 20 dollars for one foot six inches. If above eight feet and three inches, then an addition of 40 dollars for each one foot six inches is charged. Elephants ten feet six inches\nin height are taken by the Siamese to the capital, and it is not permitted to sell them. The Keddah chiefs used formerly to breed elephants, a speculation rarely if ever attempted elsewhere. Coromandel native traders were until late years constantly in the habit of loading vessels with elephants for that coast.\u201d (Extract from Lieut.-Colonel James Law\u2019s \u201cDissertation,\u201d &c.)\n\nORDINARIA.\n\nGen.

Elliot, Esq. (\u201cMadras Journal,\u201d vol. x. 1839, p. 219). The colour of the adult is brownish-black, scantily covered with black hairs, of which few retain the infantile yellowish sub-terminal band. Besides the black recumbent mane of the occiput and back, the whiskers and bristles above and below the eye, there is a bundle of long black bristles on the throat. The hairs of the throat and chest are reversed. The tail is scantily covered with short hairs, the apex compressed, with long lateral bristles like those of the elephant, arranged like the wings of an arrow. The young is more hairy, with the plurality of hairs tawny or fulvous, some with black root and apex, which, as they are more or less mixed with black hairs, produce on the sides of the body saturated fulvous stripes. The hairs of the throat, chest, abdomen, and elbows (in the two latter places very long) are black at the basal and white at the apical half. Wild hogs are exceedingly numerous on the peninsula and most of the Malayan islands. The largest boar examined measured from the apex of the nose to the root of the tail five feet, the tail one foot. The stomach of a young boar, examined shortly after it had been speared, was extended with food, principally consisting of the remains of a very large coleopterous larva, some small seeds of different kinds, leaves, grass, and roots.\n\nSus scrofa, var. sinensis, Linn\u00e9.\n\nSyn.\u2014\u201cBabi\u201d of the Malays.\nIntroduced by the Chinese settlers.\nGen.

The Museum of the Asiatic Society possesses a skull, and also a head with the skin on, of *Rhinoceros sumatranus*, Raffles, from the Tenasserim Provinces, in which locality the existence of the species has been recorded by Dr. Helfer and Mr. Blyth. This fact would seem to corroborate the statement of the Malays, and the habitat of *Rhinoceros sumatranus* may reasonably be expected to be hereafter found to extend over the neighbouring Malayan Peninsula. As such it has indeed been enumerated by Capt. Begbie, the author of \"Malayan Peninsula,\" &c., Madras, 1834. In Lieut.-Colonel Low's \"History of Tenasserim\" (\"Journal Royal Asiatic Society,\" vol. iii. 1836) is figured the head of a young Rhinoceros, which, from the considerable protuberance between the eyes, appears to represent a two-horned (probably the present) species.\n\nGen.

As described by Colonel Farquhar, it was of a beautiful black velvet colour, with purple reflections, with numerous small and other larger irregular spots on the body, arranged in longitudinal stripes, above of a rich gamboge, beneath and on the inner side of the extremities paler yellow. The under-lip was white. The shrivelled remains of the black funiculus umbilicalis were upwards of four inches in length.

The skin, imperfectly preserved, has lately been deposited in the Museum of the Asiatic Society.\n\nOn the 16th of May 1845 I obtained a living young female Tapir, captured in Keddah a few days previously. Though still in its infantile garb, it was older than the preceding. The ground colour was a brownish-black, like worn-out velvet; the spots, stripes, and the posterior part of the abdomen were of a dirty-white. The separate hairs were longer and curly; the hairy ears retained numerous white spots on the margins and external surface. The lips were blackish, with numerous short distant bristles, which also appeared round the nostrils, on the ridge of the nose, above and below the eyes, on the cheeks, and on the throat. Two black mammae were situated between the hind legs, three and a half inches behind the large naked cicatrix of funiculus umbilicalis.

The daytime it spent in sleeping in a dark recess of the portico of my house, though it would rouse itself if noticed. Towards sunset it became lively, would bathe, feed, saunter abroad, and with its lengthened nose examine objects in the way. Within a few days after its arrival it commenced to exhibit a marked partiality to the society of man, not indeed to its keeper in particular, whom it scarcely had discrimination enough to distinguish, but to anybody who happened to notice or caress it. Towards sunset it would follow a servant on the green in front of the house, and punctually imitate his movements, whether standing, walking, or running. If the man suddenly hid himself, the Tapir would hasten to the spot where it had lost sight of its leader, look about in all directions, and, if unsuccessful in discovering him, express its disappointment by a peculiar loud whistling. On the re-appearance of the man it expressed its pleasure by rubbing its side against his legs, running between them, occasionally giving out a short singular sound, resembling that produced when the larger woodpeckers tap the trees, but more sonorous. When of an evening it heard the voices of people in the verandah above the portico, it exhibited strong marks of impatience till let loose, when of its own accord it would, awkwardly enough, ascend a flight of stairs leading to the verandah. It would then quietly lie down at their feet, and by stretching its limbs and shaking its head, express the satisfaction it derived from being caressed; and it was only by compulsion that it could be made to leave the company. Its food consisted of plantains, pine-apples, mangustins, jambu, leaves of *Ficus pipul*, sugar-cane, and boiled rice, of which latter it was particularly fond if mixed with a little salt. Its drink was water, and also milk and cocoanut oil, which latter taste the Tapir possesses in common with the Orang-utan. It delighted in bathing, and was otherwise cleanly. When roaming about the garden (its walk was like that of the elephant) it would select a spot with soft earth, and like a cat form with its hind legs a small excavation, and again cover it. The whole body has a peculiar and by no means offensive exhalation, somewhat resembling that noted of *Arctictis Binturong*. Indeed, this is so tenacious that although the skin of the individual above described has been preserved more than a twelvemonth, and kept in a strongly camphorated case, the odour is still perceptible.\n\nOn the 27th of June 1845 the subject of the preceding notice expired after two days' illness from inflammation of the lungs,\nbrought on by the strong southerly winds prevailing throughout the Straits of Malacca during the season, which in man produce a slight influenza, in animals frequently terminating fatally. The few adult Tapirs which occasionally have been kept in confinement by residents in Malacca have acquired the character of being hardy animals. During the short period that the present lived in my possession no perceptible change appeared in its growth, but a striking alteration took place in its colours. Nearly all the white spots on the head, nape of the neck, and back of the ears gradually disappeared, and the upper part only of the margin of the ears remained white, which colour it retains in the adult animal. On the posterior part of the back and sides the black and white stripes were in a state of progressing obliteration; their hairs had faded to a brownish colour, and were about being replaced by a shorter and less dense fur of the fresh white hairs, which were to form the characteristic permanent white mark, already appearing in outline, when death terminated the unfinished process of nature.\n\nVertebr\u00e6: cervical seven, of which the atlas and epistroph\u00e6us the largest; dorsal twenty, lumbar four, sacral seven, caudal three.\n\nSternum: the anterior extremity cartilaginous, sharply keeled, arched, continued over manubrium, composed of two rounded angularly joined pieces, as far as the second pair of ribs; corpus composed of five pieces, of which the two posterior, in a pair, are connected by cartilage.\n\nCost\u00e6 ver\u00e6, eight pairs; spuriae, twelve pairs = twenty pairs.

The few ponies, which the wealthier use for ordinary purposes, are imported either from Siam, Burma, or Sumatra. The Malays either travel by water, or prefer the elephant as a locomotive more dignified than the horse.\n\nRUMINANTIA.\n\nGen.

Sumatra, Java.\nIn some individuals the back is nearly black. The colour and distribution of the marks of the chest and abdomen are also liable to individual variations, one of which gave rise to the supposed species, *Moschus fulviventer*. The animal is by the Malays indiscriminately denominated \"Kanchil\" and \"Pelandok;\" the latter denomination is sometimes *par excellence* applied to the young, and this circumstance in all probability gave rise to the supposed species *Moschus Pelandok*. The species is astonishingly numerous. In Prince of Wales Island any number may be procured within a short notice, at the rate of one Spanish dollar per dozen. Knowing the partiality of these deer to the leaves of the sweet potato plant (*Convolvulus batatas*), the Malays either use traps baited with this vegetable, or lie in ambush on moonlight nights in fields where it is cultivated, and disable the intruders by throwing sticks at their legs. In confinement, in its native climate, the animal becomes rather delicate, though it occasionally survives, and even breeds. The female has four mammae, and one or two young at a time. The new-born measures eight and six-eighth inches in length, of which the head is three inches, the tail one inch. The skin of the upper parts is of a pale blackish colour, scantily covered with short, fine, brown hairs. The abdomen and inner side of the limbs are pale yellow; the throat and chest have the dark marks of the adult, but paler. The largest adults measure from the apex of the nose to the root of the tail one foot six and a half inches; the tail three inches in length.\n\n**Tragulus javanicus**, Pallas.\n\n**Syn.**\u2014Moschus javanicus, Gmelin.\n- Moschus javanicus, Pallas apud Raffles.\n- Napu, Raffles.\n- Moschus indicus, Gmelin }\n- Cervus javanicus, Osbek } apud Gray.\n- Moschus Napu, Fred.

The canines of the female are very small. The four mammae are situated at the posterior part of the abdomen, a little in front of the hind legs. The anterior pair are half an inch apart; the posterior two-eighths of an inch apart. The two pairs are half an inch distant from each other. In an adult female, measuring from the apex of the nose to the root of the tail two feet four and two-eighth inches, the tail five inches, the intestinal canal was of the following dimensions:\u2014\nSmall intestines . . . . . 13 feet 6 inches.\nLarge \u201d \u201d \u201d \u201d \u201d 7 \u201d \u201d 10 \u201d \u201d\nC\u00e6cum \u201d \u201d \u201d \u201d \u201d 0 \u201d \u201d 6 \u201d \u201d\n\nThe gall-bladder is very large; immediately behind it is situated the right kidney.\n\nGen.

It is numerous in Kedah, and at present in Pinang. But it did not inhabit Prince of Wales Island till one of the last governors of the late presidency took the trouble of importing from Bengal some pairs, which were kept in the park adjoining Government House (Suffolk House). When the Presidency of Prince of Wales Island was abolished, and with it all its paraphernalia, except the titles of as many of its officers as were necessary to the continuance of H.M. Court of Judicature, the deer of the quondam Governor's park found their way into the jungle, where they have multiplied to a prodigious extent.\n\nRusa, Hamilton Smith.\n\nRusa equina, Hamilton Smith.\n\nSyn.\u2014Cervus equinus, Cuvier.\nCervus Rusa, Raffles.\nRusa etam or Kumbang, Raffles.\n\"Rusa\" or \"Rusa \u00e9tam\" of the Malays of the Peninsula.\n\nHab.\u2014Malayan Peninsula, Pinang.\nSumatra, Borneo.\n\nThe Malayan individuals correspond with the description given by Sir S. Raffles of Cervus Rusa. The lips are whitish; the posterior part of the lower sometimes dark brown. Round the eyes and the lachrymal sinus, on the side of the forehead, root of the ears, and on the throat, the hairs are either uniformly pale ferruginous, or have a subterminal band of that colour, the effect of\nwhich is to impart a pale rusty tint to these parts. Normally, each horn has three antlers, of which the lower or anterior, commencing from the burr, is directed outwards till towards the apex, which turns slightly inward. The second and outward turned antler commences at the root of the third, and is the shortest of the three. The third is directed inwards, and is the longest of the three. In the number, direction, and size of the antlers numerous individual variations occur.\n\nAccording to Mr. Blyth's observations, *Cervus Hippelaphus* has, normally, the third antler much longer than the second; *Cervus Aristotelis* has much larger and more divergent horns, of which the second and third antlers are about equal. Considering the similarity of colours and size of *Cervus equinus*, *Hippelaphus*, and *Aristotelis*, Mr. Elliot is probably right in considering all three as varieties of the great Indian stag, described by Aristotle under the designation of *Hippelaphus* (\"Madras Journal,\" 1839, p. 220); and *Cervus Peronii*, Cuvier (Cerf du Timor) may probably be added as a fourth variety.\n\n**Panolia**, Gray: List.\n\n**Panolia acuticornis**, Gray: List.\n\n**Syn.**\u2014Cervus frontalis, McClelland?\nCervus lyratus, Schinz?\n\n**Hab.**\u2014Malayan Peninsula.\n\nA single skull of a stag, killed in Keddah, has the horns so like those of the Munneepore animal, that the species might be taken to be identical, but the Malays assert theirs to be maned, and of a dark colour, with white spots, like the Axis. This stag is further described as being extremely wary, and therefore seldom seen but on heights inaccessible to man. The skull is of an old male, with the teeth (canines in particular) much ground.\n\n**Gen.

Domesticated, it is very plentiful, and is the principal draught cattle employed by the Malays and the Chinese settlers. The black-coloured, apparently the hardier, is preferred by the Malays; the reddish-white freckled with brown is the greater favourite of the Chinese. Both are very slow, and, as observed by Lieut.-Colonel Low, delicate, and liable to sudden attacks of disease if worked in the sun.\nCETACEA.\n\nHERBIVORA.\n\nGen.

R. Logan, Esq.\n\n[\u201cJournal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,\u201d vol. xvi. pp. 519-57, 667-84.]\n\nThe following paper was sent to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in January 1846. The delay which has taken place in its publication in their Journal enables the writer to append an extract from a letter to Professor Ansted, in which he has given a summary of the result of his subsequent observations made in localities more favourable for geological inquiries than those to which his attention had been confined when the paper was written. It may save the reader some trouble if he be furnished at once with the key to the theoretical discrepancies which may be noticed between the paper and the letter. He thinks it better to do this, and to leave the former as it stands, with all its faults, rather than to alter it in conformity with his more matured but still imperfect views. The geology of every fresh region has to be worked out amidst doubts and errors, and a record of the stages through which its theory, if\nat all new, passes in its progress towards complete truth, may often serve ultimately as its best demonstration, because it will show that it was not hastily adopted, but gradually grew out of a long-continued and defeated effort to assign to every new phenomenon a place in familiar systems.\n\nThe principal result at which the writer had arrived when the paper was written was the opinion advanced hypothetically in it, that the southern extremity of the peninsula, &c., had been ruptured and upraised by subterraneous forces, and that through the rocks so affected ferruginous gases, &c., had been emitted. The action of these gases on the rocks had, amongst other transformations, produced laterite. The paper was written under the impression that the formation of plutonic rocks and plutonic action in sedimentary rocks were confined to deep subterranean levels (see the writings of Mr. Lyell and other English geologists). Hence it seemed necessary to believe that the superficial igneous action with which the paper was mainly concerned was wholly unconnected with the granitic and other plutonic rocks of the district; subsequent investigation of some of the best developments of these led to the conviction that the Tartarean theory was inapplicable to them at least. The disturbed sedimentary rocks were re-examined free from the bias of that theory, and it then appeared that, while the evidence in favour of the metamorphic origin of the laterites, &c., was so strong and varied that it might be now recorded as a demonstrated fact, there were no apparent obstacles to the reception of the simple hypothesis that they were caused by plutonic agency, and that the plutonic rocks of the districts were themselves the agents of the alteration or the effects of one and the same hypogene agency. This hypothesis embraces at once the whole region of elevation in which Singapore is situated, with all the plutonic, volcanic, and metamorphic phenomena which it exhibits. It refers the whole to one cause operating throughout a long period of time, and which has not yet entirely ceased to operate, as the volcanic emission of Sumatra and the vibrations of the whole region, from time to time, and the thermal springs of Sumatra and the peninsula, constantly testify to us. This cause is the existence of an internal plutonic intumescence or nucleus, which has slowly swollen up, fracturing the sedimentary strata, saturating and seaming them with its exhalations, and as it forced itself up beneath them and through the gorges and fissures, at once upheaving them and feeding on their substance, till in many places it pressed and eat through them to the refrigerating surface, and rose, congealing, into the air or sea. It is this latter circumstance that distinguishes the region from all those which have been observed by European geologists, and it is this singularly high level which the plutonic reduction has reached that explains the extraordinary appearances which the unreduced\nsuperficial rocks have so often assumed. The metamorphosed rocks of Europe convinced a deep subterranean saturation with plutonic exhalations, and European geologists concluded that plutonic action was necessarily deeply subterraneous. But here, I think, we find a suba\u00ebrial or subaqueous plutonic activity; and where the plutonic level has not reached that of the pre-existing rocks, a new kind of metamorphism appropriate to the new conditions under which the plutonic exhalations have operated.\n\nThe interest which the discussions respecting laterite have given to that rock tends to invest it with undue importance geologically. The ferruginous emissions have affected all rocks indiscriminately, and their action on sandstones, grits, and conglomerates is as well marked as that on clays, marls, and shales, although the latter only produces proper laterite. Even in the clays, laterite denotes one only of many degrees and forms of alteration. To expose the origin of these rocks and its unity, to record the cause of the difficulties which have been presented, and to distinguish them from true metamorphic rocks, I would propose, avoiding any new technical names, to term them simply the iron-masked rocks of the Indo-Australian regions. This term will include the principal or plutonically ferruginated rocks, which, without being either completely reduced or metamorphosed, have been either wholly disguised or partially altered by ferruginous emissions, which have saturated them in the mass, or only affected them in fissures and seams, or been interfused between portions of the rocks not actually separated by fissures, but intersected by planes of mere discontinuity, the sides of which have an imperfect cohesion, or having a common border of inferior density and increased porosity caused either by interruptions in the original deposition of the matter of the rock or by unequal stretching or incipient cleavage. The term may be also extended perhaps to those sedimentary beds in which the iron saturation, although coeval with the deposit of the other constituents of the rock, has served to obscure or conceal their true nature as well as the derivation of the beds themselves. These beds appear to have been sometimes formed by superficial layers of gravel, &c., being permeated by iron solutions. With these must not be confounded the broad bands lying over and beside the heads of iron-masked dykes, and which, having been in a loose, gravelly, or fragmentary state at the time when the plutonic emissions passed through them, became cemented into hard, and occasionally scoriaceous, ferruginated conglomerates, &c., and are therefore proper plutonically iron-masked rocks.\n\nBefore entering on a detailed account of the mineralogical features of Singapore, it will be convenient to bring into a preliminary paper some discussions of a theoretical nature, which, if not thus separated from the former, might in the sequel occasion frequent\ninterruptions and some confusion. A brief sketch of the topography of the island will suffice as a basis for the remarks which follow it.\n\nThe island is of an irregular figure, when correctly laid down (for the published maps, with the exception of Mr. Thomson's, are very incorrect), resembling a bat, the head being at Tanjong Sinoko, in the old strait, the tail at Tullah Blanga, or rather Blakan Mati; the western wing being fully expanded, and the eastern a little retracted. Its greatest length from Pulo Campong or Point Macalister on the west to Tanjong Changai on the east\u2014i.e., between the tips of the wings\u2014is twenty-one miles. Its greatest breadth from T. Sinoko to T. Blanga coast\u2014i.e., from the head to the tail\u2014is twelve miles. Its superficial extent is roughly calculated at 200 square miles.\n\nThe town of Singapore, to start from the best known point, is situated at the south-western extremity of a flat alluvial tract, of which the greatest length in a straight line near the sea-beach is about six miles, and the greatest breadth inland about two and a half miles. Three well-marked deposits occur in this flat. A stiff clay of a greyish hue, becoming in some places darker and even blackish; a whitish, greyish, or yellowish sand; and a vegetable deposit, consisting, where most recent, of fragments of wood or masses of aquatic plants more or less decomposed, and, where older, of a soft peaty matter passing into a black mud. The mode in which these beds have been deposited will be described hereafter. The west side of this plain is marked by low rounded hillocks, separated by openings on the same level as the plain. On following these in a north-westerly direction, the former are found to be the extremities of distinct ranges of hills, and the latter the mouths of valleys between them, the principal extending about six miles inland. The largest valley, along which there is a public road, terminates a little to the south of a group of hills called Bukit Temah, the summit of which is 530 feet above the level of the sea, and the highest point in the island. From this group the valley and the stream which drains it borrow their name. The coast of Singapore to the S.W. of this valley also follows a N.W. direction. The intervening space is occupied towards the sea by a prominent range of hills rising abruptly to a height of 300 feet at Tullah Blanga, which has lately been made the signal station. Towards the Bukit Temah valley a broad irregular range of hills is united apparently with the Tullah Blanga range on the N.W., and as it proceeds the S.E. separates from it and gives room for a broad swampy flat, from which the Singapore River flows. Nearer town the range bifurcates, one of the forks terminating in Government Hill and the other in Mount Sophia. These hills approach close to each other, but proceeding inland, the two divisions of the range draw further back, and a secondary\nvalley of considerable breadth and about two miles in length is formed. The range on the N.E. of Bukit Temah valley springs from Bukit Temah, and terminates in a low broad sandy elevation which slopes almost insensibly till it emerges in the plain. It is in some places about one and a half miles broad. The configuration of the range\u2014and most of the others have many features in common with it\u2014may be partially observed in proceeding up the Bukit Temah valley. A succession of low hills present their rounded ends stretching into the valley, which expands into the concave or sinuous hollows between them. The lateral valleys thus formed are of various figures and extent. Many resemble a horse-shoe or amphitheatre. The upper extremities of most are of this shape, and similar indentations occur in the course of the more protracted, at the necks connecting the different hillocks which form their sides. When we strike across the range we are at first confused by the number of hillocks or hollows only partially cleared of jungle; but under patient observation they gradually assume a certain order; about the centre of the range the ground is a comparatively elevated and broad tract, but very irregular in its configuration. All these irregularities, however, it is probable, have relation to the lateral ranges. These are seen to branch off to the north and south in a series of hillocks joined to each other by their sides and sometimes by an elongated neck. Towards the valley they often bifurcate, one limb sometimes taking a direction parallel to the range and then sweeping round and expanding into one of the broad hillocks whose ends approach the public road. The peculiar character of the topography of the country arises from the multitude and individual smallness of the hills, and the circumstance of the valleys which penetrate between the principal ranges and their branches, being, except towards the centres of the ranges, perfectly flat, and very little above the level of the sea, so that the winding outlines of the bases of the hills are nearly as distinctly marked as if they sunk into the level sheet of a lake. We have, in fact, regular mountain ranges in miniature, and so symmetrical, with all the apparent irregularity, that if the highest or summit lines of the ranges and their lateral members were correctly laid down on a map, they would present no remote resemblance to the section of a tree. Beyond the last-mentioned range another long valley occurs.* The stream Balastier, which flows through it, has its rise in Bukit Temah. The further or N.E. side of this valley is formed by the Kallang range of hills, the upper extremity of which is also connected with Bukit Temah: its lower division is penetrated by a long secondary valley. One of its summits rises considerably above the general level of the hills.\n\n* For much information respecting these difficultly accessible valleys I am indebted to Mr. Thomson, the able and indefatigable surveyor to Government for the Straits.\nBeyond it the valley of the Kallang River stretches inland. This valley has not been examined up to the top, but it is believed the river rises to the north of Bukit Temah in a continuation of that range. All the preceding ranges terminate in the plain or to the west of it, and the Kallang, Balastier, Bukit Temah, and Singapore rivers all cross the plain, converge towards the town\u2014the three former uniting their waters\u2014and flow through it. The next range beyond the Kallang valley is the central range or backbone of the eastern part of the island. It does not terminate at the line where those already described sink into the plain, but continues its course to the eastward, sending out lateral ranges, the southern and western extremities of which form the boundaries of the plain. This range terminates at the Red Cliffs. All the hills on the east and N.E. sides of the island appear to be expansions of it. The valleys between the lateral ranges are bolder and deeper than those in the ranges first described, owing to the hills being generally higher and steeper. This range is connected with the Bukit Temah range. In its central parts it displays broad undulating tracts on a larger scale than the other ranges. Amongst the multitude of valleys which its branches include there is one on the northern side of some size, in which the Serangoon stream rises. This valley seems to be a peaty swamp. It passes into a broad tract of mangrove jungle, where the stream is lost in a creek which opens into the old straits of Singapore. Other streams fall into the straits from this range. This principal is the Soongie Saletar, which appears to flow through a long valley between a branch of this range and another range proceeding from the Bukit Temah group in a northerly direction. The western side of the island consists of several ranges radiating apparently from the Bukit Temah group, and penetrated by valleys, some of them, such as that of the Kranjee, which flows northward to the old strait, and the Joorong which flows southward to the Salat Sambolan, being of considerable length and terminating in broad creeks intersecting mangrove swamps. Between some of the ranges, the only wide flattish tracts in the island which are not alluvial are found. The lower parts of the valleys are mostly swampy, consisting of sand, clay, and black peaty mud; of the latter there are considerable tracts constantly moist and exhibiting an extraordinary rankness of vegetation. Looking on one of these swamps, covered with tall but slender trees, and dense underwood growing up rapidly, and from the looseness of the deep bed of black vegetable matter\u2014the accumulated remains of their short-lived predecessors\u2014destined soon to fall in their turn, and considering the deposits of clay and sand which accompany and give rise to it, it is impossible to doubt that we see nature repeating the precise process by which the materials of most of the ancient carboniferous strata were brought together. Towards the\nsea these forest marshes give place to mangrove swamps. An intelligent Chinese Gambier planter compares Singapore, not inaptly, if the eastern part of the island be excluded, to an open umbrella, of which Bukit Temah is the top and the various rivers the ribs. If we suppose the island to have been formed of a somewhat brittle material, and a strong blow from beneath to have struck it at Bukit Temah, from which cracks radiated in different directions, dividing or bifurcating in their progress, a rude idea of the lines of hills may be formed; or if we view the island from west to east, our old comparison to the section of a tree would serve us best. Bukit Temah and the adjoining hills form the stole from which one main trunk, about twelve miles in length, extends to the Red Cliffs with numerous branches. Several smaller trunks rise on the south side of the main trunk, and extend for about six miles in a S.E. direction, also sending out a multitude of small branches. To the west the roots radiate to different parts of the coast, the tap-root being about seven miles long.\n\nThe hills of the first and second ranges in the order in which they are above noticed consist chiefly of sandstone (fine-grained, gritty, and conglomeritic) and shale strata. Towards the eastern extremities of the two next ranges similar rocks are observed. Further on, soft clays of various hues, but mostly mottled white and red or purplish, passing into a soil of different shades of red, yellowish-red, and brownish-red, are observed near the surface, and occasionally protruding blocks of sienite and greenstone occur. The hills of the eastern side of the island seem to be principally sandstone with slight traces of shale. The western side is also for the most part sandstone and shale. At the N.E. extremity granite or sienite appears, and it is also seen at several places along the N. and N.W. coast.\n\nThe superficial deposits which occur at various places are very remarkable. On some hills a red stiff clay resembling laterite is found. On many, imbedded in clay of different red and brownish hues, in irregular sheets or in thin seams, occur blocks of a ferruginous clay, rock, or smaller stones and pebbles of various kinds and sizes. These will best be described hereafter by selecting particular localities where they abound.\n\nI now proceed to notice the different hypotheses that have been or may be suggested to account for these appearances. Of the alluvial plains and valleys which ramify through the island in all directions I need say nothing here, as they, in exposed beds at least, have all, or nearly all, been formed subsequent to the hills and their superjacent deposits, and are separated from the latest accessions of matter which these received at a period when they formed a multitude of little bays and long narrow inlets of the sea.\n\nThe first class of the hypotheses that may be offered in expla-\nnation of the superficial formations of Singapore embraces those that contemplate merely the position, external appearance, and size of the detached rock fragments.\n\n1. Alluvial Hypothesis.\n\nOf these, the first supposes the blocks, gravel, &c., to be the d\u00e9bris of older rocks deposited in the sea before the extrusion of the hills. If it be conceived that the elevation of the hills above the level of the sea was the same act with the protrusion of the strata of which they are composed from their previous horizontal bed to their present inclined position, we are met by the fact that the superficial deposits are not in layers conformable to these strata, but are spread over their uplifted edges. If, again, it be supposed that the hills were formed under water, and that after the accumulation of the gravel, &c., upon them, the platform from which they rise was elevated so as to cause them to emerge from the sea, we are met by other insuperable objections. Of these it is only here necessary to specify one, although looking to single limited localities the gravel deposits appear to be regularly disposed like beds derived from currents; when we compare one hill with another, we observe far too much irregularity to allow this idea to be tenable.\n\n2. Diluvial Hypothesis.\n\nAs we extend our observations this irregularity is seen to be so great that we are irresistibly led to conjecture that its causes were diluvial instead of alluvial. In many places rock fragments of all sizes are confusedly intermixed with loose clay or sand, so that if due to aqueous action it must have been of an extraordinary and violent nature thus to have borne along rapidly masses of matter containing large blocks, and deposited them in such confusion, and that often on the summits of hills. A continued diluvial action of variable force might also account for the large quantities of rounded pebbly-looking stones, and the broad thin beds of smaller gravel-like stones that occur. Closer investigation, however, seems to discover an unanswerable argument against a diluvial theory, in the fact that the larger rock fragments, and even the gravel, differ in different localities, often even when these adjoin each other, and that it has always been found that they have a certain correspondence with or relation to the subjacent rocks where these have been exposed. No decided boulder or drift has yet been noticed.\n\nColonel Low appears to have considered the scoriaceous ferruginous rock as boulders, but he gives no reason for this opinion. The gravel he refers to the concretionary tendency of soils im-\npregnated with iron. I need not stop here to remark upon these evidently hastily formed views.*\n\n3. Decomposition of Rocks in situ.\n\nThis, which is the hypothesis that next most naturally arises, would embrace many of the facts that are inconsistent with the sedimentary and diluvial suppositions, such as the local character of the rock fragments. The outcrops of the strata, which are generally highly inclined, would under meteoric influence, down to a certain line of depth which would descend with the denudation of the surface, suffer different changes according to the nature of the rock. The harder sandstones and shales would split and break down into irregular fragments. The softer sandstones, clays, and shales\u2014and of the latter especially the finely laminated beds\u2014would, under the combined chemical and mechanical influences of the air, rain, rapid transitions of temperature, &c., lose their distinctive original characters, and gradually become uniform masses of sandy or clayey soils. Every heavy fall of rain would wash away the more superficial particles. According to the declination of the sides of the hills, fragments of rock of different sizes would be carried down by the pressure of water-moved soil and gravelly fragments. Where the hills were steep, larger blocks, from the gradual loosening of their beds, would descend to lower levels by their own gravity, assisted by similar pressure from above. The summits and ridges of the hills would be most exposed to the action of sun and rain, but generally least so to the denuding power of gravity. Where the soil was loose sand, or where there were narrow summits, the process of denudation would be more active than elsewhere. The soil as it was formed would disappear, and only fragments of rock be left where the latter was of a nature to yield with difficulty, slowly and superficially, to decomposition. Where the fragments pulverized more quickly, some soil would generally be found, always drawing additions from the rocks, but always a prey to the rains.\n\nThese considerations certainly explain the present appearance of many of the hills, and in every locality phenomena occur evidently due to the forces of which I have been writing. Ridges and summits are often found consisting almost entirely of rock fragments, and it might seem that these forces alone would be adequate causes for their occurrence. But on hills with extensive flattish summits, beds of fragments, sometimes large, sometimes of all sizes mixed, sometimes uniformly small and gravel-like,\n\n* I cannot mention Colonel Low, during so many years of official toil almost the solitary votary of science and oriental literature in the Straits Settlements, without expressing the hope that he will not long withhold from this Journal the fruits of his present \"learned leisure.\"\nlying under or in the soil at various depths, from an inch to many feet below the surface, are frequently discovered by sections for roads and pits for planting spice trees, &c. It is obvious that the hypothesis which I am now considering will not explain such cases.\n\nThere is another phenomenon of frequent occurrence connected with the position of fragmentary rocks which this hypothesis ought to include if it be made the foundation of any general theory. In sections across strata they are almost invariably seen to be more or less curved as they approach the surface. Before reaching it, however, they sometimes gradually, but often abruptly, lose their compact form, and become masses of fragments. In some cases these are almost insensibly mingled with the superincumbent soil till all trace of the stratum disappears. But it is not uncommon to see the curve pass into a line more or less horizontal, and even bent downwards, and the fragments streaming away as it were in a layer of which the direction seems to have no relation to the parent stratum, but which generally possesses or approaches to parallelism with the plane of the surface. It is true that of some of these cases the hypothesis which we are at present pursuing might seem to afford a solution. Thus, suppose a thin layer of hard sandstone to rest on a bed of soft sandy clay or unlaminated shale, both inclined and having their outcrop on the slope of a hill, a certain depth from the surface of the slope, would be subject to the action of meteoric forces which would cause the sandstone to break up into fragments, and the sandy clay to become loose and open. The sandstone rubble, if heavy, might possibly tend to descend or settle in a perpendicular line through the upper pulverulent to the lower and more compact soil, and at all events, as the soil below it was carried away, the rubble would descend along the line of the slope, the heavier fragments remaining at and near the point of outcrop, those of medium size streaming further down the slope, and the smallest borne away with the fine sand and clay to lower levels; the possibility of the existence of such lines of rubble, their breadth down the slope from the line of outcrop, and the quantity and size of the fragments being always determined by the texture of the recipient bed of clay or sand, and the declivity of the hill. Where the slope of the hill consisted of a succession of similar layers and beds, the lower layers of rubble would, in course of time and in favourable positions, become covered with soil brought down from above. There are undoubtedly cases which, if taken by themselves, this explanation will satisfy. But when we seek to convert this hypothesis into a general rule we are at once met by numerous discordant appearances. Thus, of the extensive layers of rubble or gravel-like fragments beneath a thick bed of clay which, as before mentioned, are found on broad even summits of hills and ridges, there are\nmany where the clay is too compact and aluminous, or the rubble too fine for the latter to have descended from the surface of the former, and where there are no adjacent higher levels from which the former could have been degraded and superimposed upon the latter. There are other allied cases too which simple atmospherical causes will not account for, and which bring us to the next hypothesis\u2014that of\n\n4. Earthquakes.\n\nThe instances alluded to are where the heads of the strata are not merely converted into rubble and bent in the line of slope, but where they are in zigzag, crooked, or sinuous lines; where adjacent layers are differently and irregularly deflected out of their planes; where the rubble is here in large pieces lying in the direction of the proper plane or of a regular curve from it, and there shattered into a confused mass of small fragments, sometimes much thicker and sometimes much thinner than the unaltered layer itself; or where fragments of one layer are intermixed with those of an adjacent one, detached pieces of a sandstone layer, for instance, imbedded in a layer of clay above it, or portions of both layers confusedly mingled till all trace of their lines of demarcation is lost.\n\nIt is clear that no ordinary mechanical operations caused by atmospherical forces could have produced such results, and that violent convulsive movements of the earth have left these records. In the slight earthquakes felt at Penang in 1843 it was remarked that the residents on the hills described their effects differently from the residents on the plain, or in language more exaggerated. In Belmont House, which is situated on the summit of a peaked hill rising freely out of the Pentland chain, the tremor was particularly strong. Upon general mechanical principles it is evident that the shocks will be most severely felt wherever the rocks acted on are freest. Through a dense homogeneous mass extending uniformly in all directions, equable undulations and vibrations may pass without disturbing the internal arrangement, because the motive force will meet with an equal resistance throughout. But where the mass acted on suddenly changes from a dense to a lighter rock, fractures and other internal disturbances will follow according to the intensity of the force, and where the mass of rocks is met externally by the rare elastic mass of the atmosphere, the resistance in that direction being removed per saltum, the general centrifugal tendency which will be impressed by the nether forces, even when their proper direction is more horizontal than vertical, will cause the upper rock to a certain depth to be fractured, loosened, and expanded, the external fragments and particles being perhaps quite free, and even projected. In this con-\ndition the whole superficial mass will readily yield to continuing vibratory action, and any or all of the phenomena above described may be the result. It is a further argument in favour of mechanical convulsions of considerable violence and irregularity, that although the general dip of the strata of Singapore be from westerly to easterly, cases are found on a hill resting on the same apparent base, with an adjoining one where the general rule operates, having its strata inclined from east to west, and even in the same hill particular sides or outlying ridges or spurs present deviations both in the direction and in the angle of the dip.\n\n5. Volcanic Action.\n\nHitherto we have remarked no phenomena that may not be referred to the ordinary mechanical or chemical forces acting at the surface of the earth, or to critical mechanical disturbances. But I have now to notice a large and varied class of facts which require different forces to be introduced. These facts are so numerous, so constant in their occurrence over every part of the island which is open to examination, and not less than elsewhere in those parts from which the observations of writers on the geology or mineralogy of Singapore have been drawn, that it is difficult to conceive through what fatality they have hitherto for the most part escaped notice or been passed over as unimportant. The most obvious of these facts are dykes and veins of igneous rocks, masses *in situ* and scattered fragments of rocks, such as sandstone, clays, shales, granite, &c., altered by the action of fire; rocks in veins and joints often highly indurated, whereby sandstone has acquired sometimes a cellular structure, and at other times externally a honeycombed appearance; congeries of curved, zigzag, and radiating veins in sandstone, clays and shales, filled with crystalizations, and both from their own appearance and the alteration in the rock in which they are found showing chemical or electrical action of a volcanic nature; the presence of sulphur accompanying anthracite in shales denigrated and rendered fuliginous by fire; the slaggy appearance of many rocks and fragments which are often covered externally by a shining black, bluish-black, or dull iridescent varnish or glaze; the scoriaceous appearance of others, many being mere cinders; the abundant presence of oxides of iron, and particularly their intensity in those places where the other evidences of igneous action are most marked, and their absence where these are entirely wanting. It is impossible to refer these facts, and others of an analogous character which will be mentioned in a future paper in the description of particular localities, to any but volcanic causes. The reddish, reddish-brown, and reddish-black rocks which are found so abundantly have been noticed by Lieutenant Newbold, Colonel Low, and others. The\ngeneral name of laterite has been sometimes applied to them. Colonel Low uses the terms \"iron-clay,\" \"iron-stone,\" and \"iron-ore.\" The red soils have been in like manner called laterite or iron-soils. Both terms appear to be objectionable. Laterite is a particular species of ferruginous clay which indurates on exposure to the atmosphere, like many other rocks; it ought to be restricted to the clay to which it was assigned by Dr. Hamilton, and not indiscriminately applied to every new rock strongly marked by oxides of iron. With respect to the term iron-clay or clay-iron-stone, it has not yet been shown that any of the proper argillaceous iron-ores, into the composition of which carbonic acid enters so largely, are found in Singapore. If there are any, they have been disguised and changed by heat, decomposing into peroxides. The fact, however, is, that these so-called laterites and iron-ores, externally as to colour and form differing little if at all, prove often on examination to be only fragments of the common stratified rocks, sometimes calcined, sometimes indurated, and sometimes partially fused by heat. We cannot, therefore, resort to a prevalence either of laterite or iron-ores to explain the geology of the island, and are by the rocks, which have been so designated, led back to volcanic causes.*\n\nSuch a comparatively small portion of Singapore has yet in any way been laid bare, and of the accessible parts, with certain\n\n* Laterite.\u2014Many of the clayey hills here appear to me to be decomposed sienite, sometimes unaltered by supervening volcanic action, but generally partaking in the metamorphism which the matter of most of the elevated land has suffered from that cause. May I venture to suggest that the hypothesis which is developed in this paper for Singapore might, if applied to the laterite of India, perhaps explain its origin, and in doing so to a certain extent also reconcile the conflicting opinions that have been maintained regarding it? All that I have read of the great laterite formations of the south of India, and which extend to the heart of Bengal, where they are described by Dr. Buchanan, leads to the conclusion that they do not consist of purely volcanic, sedimentary, or decomposed matter, but what I have termed semi-volcanic. The same formation is found at Malacca and analogous deposits at Singapore, and both inseparably associated and evidently contemporaneous with altered rocks of the kind previously noticed. If we conceive an area with trap, granite, sandstone, shale, &c., exposed at the surface (in the atmosphere or in the sea), and partly decomposed or disintegrated, to be subjected to a peculiar species of minor volcanic action like that which is described in this paper (the distinctive phenomenon probably of one and the same geological epoch), the result would be that, with the occasional exception of matter ejected from no great depth, and some dykes and veins, the previous soft surface rocks would be merely altered or metamorphosed by heat and impregnated with iron, derived perhaps from the basaltic and other ferriferous rocks through which the discharged steam, gases, and water had passed in their ascent. Whether the action took place under or above the sea would be determined by the presence or absence of the ordinary marks of oceanic denudation.\n\nWhen clays strongly ferruginous, and soft from saturation with water, are dried, the iron previously held in solution by the water is deposited between the particles, and cements them into a hard compact rock. Hence the induration of laterite clays on exposure to the atmosphere.\nexceptions, so little is open to inspection save the mere surface, that had my examination of the most favourable localities of the latter been much more minute and careful than it has been, I should still have hesitated to combine the results into any general hypothesis. But as such an hypothesis has been forced upon me while following up my inquiries, and no facts have hitherto been noticed to which it is irreconcilable, I shall endeavour to explain it, leaving to future observations to build it into a theory or reject it as a fancy. And as I shall proceed in subsequent papers to furnish detailed accounts of different localities, the reader will be enabled to draw his own conclusions.\n\nThe general direction of the elevatory force to which the hills of Singapore and the neighbouring islands owe their origin, was from W. by S. to E. by N., since their dip is generally in or near that direction. Although the undulations or upheavings had this general tendency, the causes to which they were due must have been of a somewhat irregular nature, at one time producing a superficial effect, either uniform in its character or small in degree, and at another time increasing in violence, and at particular points causing convulsive elevations of the rocks in the form of hills, frequently in undulating ridges and chains, the linear directions of which were, it may be, determined by a pre-imposed tendency to fracture, as will be noticed in the sequel. This force was apparently of a volcanic, or what, to distinguish it from concentrated well-developed volcanic action, may be called a semi-volcanic nature, producing great heat at particular places, which sometimes merely indurated or calcined the softer strata and reddened the superjacent soil, but often in steam or gases, and occasionally in mud or semi-fused rock burst through them, or found a vent in fissures caused by ruptures during the process of elevation. When the heat was most intense, fused rocks or semi-fused fragments were cast up through these vents. As its intensity decreased fragments less altered and masses of clay and sand were ejected. The volcanic steam, gases, or fluids were charged with iron, which left strong marks of its presence wherever these were most active, rendering most of the fused and semi-fused rocks, in dykes or ejected above the surface, highly ferruginous and impregnating all the softer adjacent rocks.\n\nIn some places the force, although of unusual violence, was at the surface chiefly mechanical, rending solid sandstones and tossing up and mingling the fragments with masses of soft clays and shales. Thus in some parts of Government Hill and the adjoining hill (Mt. Sophia) large angular blocks of solid sandstone, some from 600 to 800 cubit feet in bulk, are found at the surface, and at various depths beneath it, in a confused mass of clays and shales. In the same hills, however, there were also subsequently formed volcanic fissures, through which torrified rocks were ejected into\nthe air, and strewed over the surface, so as in some places to form a thick bed over the disrupted sandstone, &c.\n\nThis extreme degree of local mechanical violence, unaccompanied by simultaneous igneous action reaching the surface, is, however, rare, and may have been in some measure caused by a greater thickness and compactness in the resisting rock. But in general the upheaving of the hills has been attended with a violent agitation or tremor, producing the phenomena alluded to in a former page as due to concussion.\n\nFrom what has been said it will be seen that the volcanic forces were not concentrated at one or two points, and of comparatively great power, so as to form regular craters of eruption or to elevate rocks to a great height, but that they extended over a considerable area, and that their intensity and mode of action varied greatly at different places.\n\nAmongst the most common volcanic products is one, small in size, and varying in its character from common indurated argillaceous and lithomargic to porcellanous and jaspidious, which occurs in very singular forms\u2014vermicular, pseudo-coralloidal, columnar,* and frequently resembling pieces of ginger-root, externally smooth, granulated, corrugated, reticularly fibrous, &c. These are the compact forms, but there often occur vesicular, or rather rudely ramose cavities descending between the short thick irregular branches towards the centre, the branches being themselves also sometimes perforated.\n\nAnother product is a small smooth faintly shining black stone like a fine gravel.\n\nAt other places a gravel similar in shape, but with a brownish or chestnut-coloured coat or enamel, occurs. These latter products may readily be mistaken for water-worn gravel, especially as they often occur in broad thin beds, but on closer examination it is clear they are of volcanic origin.\n\nAll the various forms of ejected substances met with are due, I conceive, in some degree to differences in the original mineral ingredients of the rocks, but chiefly to the inequality of torrefaction, and the circumstance of the heated, fused, or semi-fused substances cooling in the air or in mud or loose sand or clay.\n\nAt an early stage in my inquiries I was led to think that the causes of the eruptions were in part what have been called pseudovolcanic, and if coal shall be discovered it will then become a question whether many of the geological phenomena of Singapore are not due to volcanic action giving rise to and accompanying\n\n* Amongst the common large slags, which are generally of irregular rounded shapes, I have occasionally seen one agreeing in form with those small columnar stones and externally rugose and roughly fibrous. In fact, one may say it is the same as one magnified in bulk from a few cubic inches to 10 or 15 cubic feet, and with all its characters rendered coarse in proportion.\nthe conflagration of coal-beds. This would account for the paucity of proper volcanic products at the surface, and the abundance of merely altered fragments agreeing in character with the existing superficial strata, and of slaggy and scorious rocks, of which the materials, with the exception of the oxides of iron, might have been derived from similar strata at no great depth. The iron might, on this supposition, have been supplied by beds of ore occurring amongst the carboniferous rocks.\n\nAt present this view is inadmissible; and it would still remain so even if no other hypothesis derived from analogy were probable. But there have been many volcanoes without streams of lava, from which earth and altered rocks, gases, steam, water, or mud have been ejected, and there are abundant marks of igneous action throughout the series of stratified rocks, proving how frequently volcanic forces have operated from beneath, often without reaching the surface at all, and at other times producing mechanical, igneous, or electrical changes in the superficial rocks, unaccompanied by the more marked phenomena of proper volcanoes.\n\nBut the absence of such products in Singapore is not universal, nor are there wanting proofs of the direct connection of the superficial igneous action with a great nether fountain of volcanic power. It is clear that the action reached below the stratified rocks, for in some of the hills near town I have discovered fragments of unaltered sienite, and on one, a large block of sienite passing into basalt, which may either be an ejected fragment, or the protruded summit of a continuous mass, is now being quarried by Chinese. In the Bukit Temah group solid masses of sienite are exposed, and appear to compose a large part of one of the hills. At some places I found it passing into basalt. That the elevation of the sienite and basalt was contemporaneous with the production of the ordinary volcanic or igneous phenomena of Singapore (if the basalt itself was not also then formed) is, to say the least, highly probable. Not only the sides in general, but the summits of the hill, consist of a thick mass of soft ferruginous clay or mould, holding large quantities of the common igneous rocks found elsewhere, but often bearing marks of a more intense igneous action. Thus on the same side of the hill where the sienite and basalt are laid bare, I found, in contact with soft sandstone, a piece of compact, dull, igneous rock of a light yellowish-brown colour, with veins of a violet colour and vesicles whose sides were similar. At the plane of contact the rock changed into a dark green translucent glass, which included some small opaque white specks. Within the glass the igneous rock for a narrow space was finely vesicular, and violet-coloured like veins and some grains of the sandstone were scattered through this band. The opaque spots in the glass were evidently included grains of sand semi-fused at their edges. This specimen is identical in character\nwith some products of proper volcanoes. In the slopes to the west of Bukit Temah, which are covered with thick beds of clays and sands, included layers, composed of fragments of torrified granite, occur.\n\nMany of the islands and rocks near Singapore exhibit most decisive proofs of volcanic convulsions. Thus in a reef of sandstone rocks lying between the island of Blakan Mati and Pulo Sikijang, a black ferruginous rock has been obtruded as a lava through seams and fissures in the sandstone, and at some places has spread over that rock and boiled up above it, assuming fantastic shapes; the sandstone is altered by heat in the same manner as the rock is often seen to be in Singapore.* Basalt and greenstone are found on Pulo Ooban, which lies close to the north-east coast of Singapore. Similar rocks of various structure and character, compact, vesicular, &c., with claystone, porphyries, and other volcanic minerals, are brought from islands in the neighbourhood to Singapore to be used for the foundations of houses. The original production of the latter rocks must of course be referred to an epoch long anterior to that of the former, which undoubtedly corresponds with that of the Singapore semi-volcanic rocks.\n\nWe are therefore, I think, justified in considering Singapore and the neighbouring islands to have been the seat of volcanic convulsions spread over a considerable area, if nowhere of great intensity. There are many reasons, but not strictly local, to believe that their date was in a late era of geological time. The subject, however, is a difficult one, and there is not room for its full discussion in this paper. I may here only mention, amongst the local facts tending to the above conclusion, the softness of some of the rocks which have not been altered by volcanic action, but have been elevated and greatly stretched or drawn out, contorted or compressed, in the process; the absence of any superficial changes not due to atmospherical causes since the time of their elevation, and the very moderate effects of these causes; the apparent continuity of some of the hill beds of sand and clay in adjacent hollows, having a ferruginous and torrified appearance in the former, while in the latter they are not distinguishable from soft modern alluvium; and lastly, some remarkable cases of the elevation of soft alluvial and vegetable deposits agreeing in their character with beds now forming in the island or along its shores.\u2020\n\n* Mr. Thomson describes to me an analogous injection of a reddish-black substance, lateritic in its appearance, into the fissures of a block of granite on the north coast of Buitang. This I shall describe on procuring a specimen, if I do not visit the locality.\n\n\u2020 It is to be remarked, however, that in a climate like that of Singapore, clay rocks and aluminous sandstones at or near the surface, unless highly indurated, are liable to become soft. The age of the elevation of the island will be more fully considered in the paper on the Straits, in connection with several\nUnfortunately the non-observation hitherto of any organic remains, while it is perhaps a reason for assigning a higher antiquity to the soft rocks above mentioned than their general appearance seems to claim, renders it very difficult to compare them with the observations of European geologists, or to ascertain whether they can be made to occupy any determinate place in their systems. This last inquiry is, however, of the least importance for the present, and if entered upon before the phenomena of this locality (so far removed from any of which the geology is in any considerable measure understood), have been minutely and faithfully studied by themselves, is more likely to mislead than to aid research. I may state, however, that in the present state of our knowledge the only European system with which the rocks of Singapore, notwithstanding the apparently recent origin of some of them, can be mineralogically compared, is the new red sandstone. The sandstones, clays, marls (non-calcareous), and shales, in many respects resemble the same rocks of that system. The rareness, if not the absence, of fossils, is a striking circumstance, and even if the two formations be remote in time from each other (for no chronological conclusion can be drawn from merely lithological characters), points to the existence of analogous conditions during the periods of their respective accumulation.\n\nIf we now recur to the present superficial igneous and ferruginous deposits of Singapore, the only remaining question under our hypothesis would be, whether their superposition on the hills (to which they are confined) took place before or after the emergence of the latter from the sea. In other words, was the present configuration of the island assumed under the level of the sea, and then the whole tract of land from which the hills spring elevated by one movement, or is it more probable that before the hills were upraised the general level of the land was the same or nearly the same as it now is, and the hills consequently obtruded from that level in whole or in part in the air? The action of the waters of the sea in spreading out the materials brought to the surface by volcanic forces might seem an obvious explanation of some of the facts formerly noticed. But if this cause be admitted at all, its operation must have been transient and limited, otherwise the surface accumulations on the different hills and parts of the same hill would not have retained their striking local characters.* If the agency of the sea is to be admitted, the most probable hypothesis, with our present information, would be, that when the process which dislocated and pushed up the strata in different places into hills began to operate, the general level of the sea-bed was much lower than it now is, and that the same instances of recent elevation occurring along its borders, where the evidence is of a more satisfactory nature, being derived from organic remains.\n\n* See ante, page 71, Diluvial Hypothesis.\naction caused its general elevation. In this way the surfaces of the hills may have emerged so gradually from beneath the sea as to admit of a partial action of its waters on their summits and sides during and subsequent to the eruptions of matter, and yet not so slowly as to give time for such extensive denudation as to obliterate the local peculiarities of the ejected substances. My own opinion at present is, that all the phenomena may be accounted for by purely volcanic succeeded by ordinary meteoric causes. At one time rock fragments and semi-fused matter would be voided, heaped up at particular places, or ejected into the air and showered over the surface. At another time, when the heat was less intense or when steam or gases, not ignifluous or melted matter, burst out, masses of soft clays and sandstone might be disembowelled and spread over the bed of fragments. At other places the rocks might be broken and pulverized in situ, and receive a considerable vertical pulsion so as transiently to form an incoherent and agitated mass, especially towards the surface, but without the fragments or sand being freely projected into the air.*\n\nOne of the most common features of the hills is the occurrence of a bed of igneous stones\u2014at one place large (30 to 60 cubic feet) slaggy and often scorious or amygdaloidal, and gradually but irregularly diminishing in size until they become a coarse and then a fine gravel, in some places dwindling into a seam of minute grains. The beds are of various thickness\u2014from three or more feet to a few lines\u2014and so, often, is the same bed at different places. They may consist of a uniform aggregate of stones, or of stones mingled with loose clay, sand, &c. Over this deposit there is generally a bed of soft clay or sandy clay. Sometimes more than one bed of gravel occurs. Layers of unaltered angular fragments are occasionally, but rarely, found beneath these beds. Layers of the small porcellanous, jaspideous, and varnished stones before noticed, and of large grains of quartz, are more common. All these layers sometimes appear in the same section, but this seldom happens. The localities where the large scoriform rocks abound are often at or near the summits of hills, or where thick dykes of igneous rock come to the surface, and probably in every case they mark the places where the largest fissures or vents were opened. Where they are most abundant they appear at the surface, and that not only in spots exposed to denuding influences, but in flattish and gently sloping tracts. There appears in\n\n* Whether the mechanical action by which the hills were upraised long preceded, or was accompanied or soon followed by, semi-volcanic action in the most intense degree which it here attained, or rather whether the semi-volcanic emissions and eruptions continued during a long period to find vent through the fissures formed when the hills were elevated, is a question that must lie over for the present. It is probable that they originated on, but lasted, or were from time to time repeated, for some time after the elevation of the hills.\nmany cases to be a connection between the direction of the dykes and fissures, and that of the hills or their spurs. Where good sections of the summits of dykes have been obtained fragments of the rock of which they are composed, not angular but scoriiform, can generally be traced as a horizontal layer on the surface, or disposed beneath a bed of clay, &c., to a considerable distance from the head of the dyke. When the dyke is vertical these stones are accumulated over and strewed on both sides of it. When it is inclined they are spread out in the direction towards which the inclination is. Two dykes adjoining each other at the surface have sometimes beds of scoria diverging from them in opposite directions, owing to their dips being opposed. The above and other observable facts are all, I think, explicable by the species of volcanic action which I have suggested, susceptible as it is of various modifications, without resorting to oceanic agency. At all events, no fact has yet come under my notice unequivocally attesting the abrading, sorting, or transporting operation of a large body of water, or which could not be referred to some known form of volcanic agency. It must also be borne in mind that the convulsive mechanical action which enters so largely into the general hypothesis, would be most powerful in shattering compact and loosening soft rocks, when the stratified masses were ruptured and raised into highly inclined, vertical, or reversed positions. In such cases the exposed basset edges, in their fragmentary or pulverized state, and before they were protected by any vegetation, would be more acted on by meteoric causes than at present.\n\nThe system of hills, with their dykes and veins, affords an interesting field for the application of the principles of mechanical science; but it would be premature to enter on this subject before the country is better opened up, as it will soon be by the lines of road now in progress. There can be little doubt, however, that the directions of the hills agree with the ramifications of fissures which in those places where the intensity of the elevatory force caused their extension to the surface have formed vents through which the superficial volcanic deposits were expelled. The principal ranges, we have seen, are nearly parallel, and have directions approximating to N.W. and S.E. The lateral hills are placed on lines at right angles to these, and the secondary lateral hills again on lines parallel to the principal ranges.\n\nMy remarks have been hitherto confined to facts entirely local, and inferences or hypotheses strictly deduced from or applicable to them. Before concluding this paper, however, let us extend the limits of our observations, and see whether a wider geological area presents phenomena repugnant to the large influence which has been assigned to volcanic causes.\n\nThat the movements which elevated the central mountains of\nthe Malayan Peninsula had an intimate relation with those that elevated the mountains of Sumatra, seems evident, whether we regard the hypothesis of De Beaumont, the more recent observations and theories of Mr. Darwin, or the mechanical researches of Mr. Hopkins. Both form long chains which pursue parallel lines not more than three or four degrees distant. But we must probably take in a much wider geographical range if we would seek a general geological theory for the region which they traverse. The mountain chains of the peninsula of India are parallel, or approximately so, to the Malayan, and, like them, spring from the great central system of Asia. The chain of the peninsula of Malaya is directly continued to this region, and from it descend nearly parallel chains through Burmah, Siam and Cochin China. These ranges determine the general direction of the sea-coasts wherever these are exposed to waves sufficiently strong to prevent the formation and extension of alluvial plains. The western coasts of India and of the Tenasserim Provinces, Siam, the Gulf of Siam, and the eastern coast of Cochin China, are thus fixed. A wide and interesting field of inquiry is opened up by the probable geological connection between the regions of these ranges and those of the Indian Archipelago generally, Australia and the archipelagos of the Pacific, evidenced by the prevalence of parallel lines of elevation, and perhaps also by organic remains, such as the fossil elephant and some of the carboniferous plants of New South Wales. The former existence of a great Australasian continent, an extension probably of the present continent of Asia, which seems to result from Mr. Darwin's theory of atolls, would be an inference in accordance with these facts. Viewing the whole region, interspersed with peninsulas and islands, from the Indian Ocean to the heart of the Pacific, as one, it appears that De Beaumont's theory of parallel rectilinear or oblong areas of elevation and subsidence, which Mr. Darwin has applied to the eastern tracts, requires modification, and that if we conceive curvilinear lines, or systems of parallel curvilinear lines, proceeding from centres and often meeting similar lines or systems from other centres, and again lateral and secondary lines diverging from the principal, the arrangement of the observed ranges will assume greater symmetry, and be found perhaps to accord with the hypothesis that one widely extended mechanical pulsion, accompanied by local foci of intense development from weakness in the rocks or increased plutonic or volcanic action, gave the first direction to all the main lines of elevation. Thus let us conceive such a centre to be situated in the western half of New Guinea\u2014and we have some independent warrant for doing so in the circumstance that the mountains of its unexplored interior appear to attain a magnitude unusual in the archipelago\u2014from this focus we may trace one great curvilinear fracture or band of rupture of\nthe earth's crust through the Sunda Islands to Chittagong; a second through the mountainous volcanic islands of Ceram and Bouro, and along the southern coasts of Celebes and Borneo (Gunong Ratos), Billiton, Banda, the Malay Peninsula, &c.; a third through the Philippines, Formosa, Japan, &c.; a fourth along the southern coast of New Guinea, and through the Solomon Islands, New Hebrides, New Zealand, &c.; a fifth along the southern coast of New Guinea, across Torres Straits, and along the eastern coast of Australia; and a sixth perhaps through the north-western division of Australia. Other principal lines probably proceed across the Moluccas and Celebes, through Borneo and the islands of the China Sea (now a subsiding tract), and join the mountain chains of Cochin China and Siam; but the geography of Borneo is not sufficiently known to allow of our positively ranking these as seventh and eighth lines. The intermediate areas may be occupied by numerous other lines, but the subsidence of various tracts renders it difficult or impossible, particularly to the eastward, to trace the original courses of vertical movement until the soundings of the Polynesian seas are ascertained. Subsequent shifting subterranean action would cause many other fractures in various directions; but it would not, at least until the lapse of a long geological epoch, obliterate the primary lines. It would often cause cross fractures, of which many instances might be pointed out. It is no objection to this hypothesis that many of the lines seem to proceed from the central table-land of Asia. Because if at the time these fissures were being extended southward, a great local action took place at or near New Guinea, they would, according to the mechanical laws examined by Mr. Hopkins, diverge from their original direction towards that point, or to meet the lines radiating from it. Thus we observe the two least broken lines to pursue a southerly direction till they reach the parallel of $8^\\circ$ N.L., when, at the Nicobars in the one and at Junk-Ceylon in the other, they are deflected to the S.E. When they cross the meridian of $106^\\circ$ E. they make a more decided bend to the eastward. If we follow these lines and the chains of Siam and Cochin China northward we may trace them upwards to the Bayan Khara mountains, and thence to the vast central mass of Kulkun, from whence great ranges are said to proceed towards all the points of the compass. But in the north-western part of the province of Yunnan and north-east of Burmah and Assam their continuity is interrupted, and we seem to have ascertained another central region whence radiate not only the lines which afterwards converge to New Guinea, but various other curvilinear ranges proceeding S.E., E., N.E., and N. through China, and N. and N.W. through Thibet; and lastly, the Himalayas and a minor range proceeding south-eastward on the south of the valley of Assam, and continued perhaps\nin the Vindyas\u2014for a subsequent line of subsidence passing down\nthe plain of the Ganges and through the Bay of Bengal, of which\nthere is some evidence, may have destroyed the pre-existing con-\ntinuity. Many of these ranges proceeded primarily from the Kul-\nkun, but it is remarkable that they converge towards the region\nindicated. The region where the Himalayas attain their sublimest\nproportions and give birth to rivers that embrace them and all\nIndia in their courses, is another grand focus. From this centre\nthe range proceeds on the one side to the eastward, and on the\nother to the N.W. To the north of the former a secondary and\napproximately parallel range also proceeds eastward, and includes\nwith it the valley of the Sampao, and to the south another and\nsmaller secondary parallel range traverses upper India. To\ndetermine the original centres of maximum intensity and directions\nof the forces that elevated the great connected mountain system\nthat forms the skeleton of the Asiatic continent, is a problem\nbeyond the present reach of geology.*\n\nThe Malayan chain I have mentioned as a series of groups,\nand from the breadth of country which their members occupy\ncompared with their height and apparent bulk, and their general\nappearance as viewed from the Straits, I am led to believe that\nthey consist of connected systems, each analogous to that of the\nSingapore hills, or of principal undulating masses from which\nparallel ranges proceed in a N.W. and S.E. direction. The rivers\nprobably have their sources at the heads of the valleys included\nbetween these ranges, and turn seaward at the extremities of the\nranges. The most southern rivers, such as the Johore, Sakadai,\n&c., which flow southward, would also bend to the east and west,\nwhere the last system of the continent terminates and that of\nSingapore begins, did they not meet with a depression so low as\nto be accessible by the sea.\n\nSingapore is merely separated from the mainland by this\ndepression, which forms a narrow tortuous river-like arm of the\nsea, and is in fact sunk into the continent and embraced by it\non three sides, so that its southern shore seems to be the proper\ncontinuation of the southern coast of the peninsula. Its geogra-\n\n* There can be little doubt that an extensive knowledge of the physical\nand mineralogical constitution of mountain ranges will form the true basis of\nthe highest department of the science, now only dawning\u2014the Mechanism of\nthe Earth. But the day is probably not far distant when the geologist, like\nthe astronomer, will need to be thoroughly indoctrinated with the principles\nof mechanical science in its widest sense. Fortunately for the worshippers of\nNature of humbler acquirements, geology is so immersed in matter, so wrought\ninto every inch of the earth, that its priests have need of a whole tribe of\nLevites. Wherever a man finds himself placed he has but to employ his eyes\nto become a useful labourer, and so far will a little knowledge be from proving\ndangerous to him that it may be safely said, that while even entire ignorance\nis not a bar to the collection of facts, every little accession of knowledge from\nany of the sciences becomes an instrument of observation.\nphical connection with it is therefore complete. When we cross the strait, no difference in the topography is observable. And the low hills, which give the surface an undulating appearance like that of Singapore, probably resemble those of the latter in their internal structure as much as they do in the superjacent soils and in the stunted jungle. The interior of the peninsula is almost wholly unexplored. In coasting along its western shore from Pinang to Cape Rachado, a high chain or rather series of ranges of mountains is observed inland nearly the whole way, which from their generally sharp-peaked summits, the nature of the detritus brought down from them by the rivers, and the evidence afforded by the few points where they have been reached, we are justified in believing to consist in great measure of plutonic rocks. In front of this range we observe a broad tract of country, often appearing to be perfectly flat and very little above the sea-level for miles together, but from which sometimes low hills rise like islands out of the sea. These hills are frequently quite solitary, and at a great distance from the central mountains, or near the coast. Further inland they seem to be generally in groups, and towards the mountains the country at some places appears hilly and undulating. At Malacca these low hills are so much grouped as to resemble some parts of Singapore, and they are covered by gravel and fragments precisely similar to those found on some of the Singapore hills. In some of the hills opposite Pinang I observed similar fragments. In both cases, the soil had a deep red ferruginous aspect.* That most of the hills scattered along the western plains of the peninsula were islands in the sea at no remote date, there can be no doubt. The plains from which they spring are flat, generally only a few feet above the sea-level, alluvial, and at some places abounding in marine shells of the same species that at present inhabit the Straits. The rivers of the peninsula, although generally small, are exceedingly numerous, and bring down large quantities of sediment. In March last, off the mouth of the Salangore River, the steamer in which I was passed through a broad tract discoloured by the sediment. Extensive mud-banks have been formed in the straits and are constantly increasing. For evidence on this subject, I must refer to a separate paper, containing some remarks on the Straits of Malacca and the alluvial tracts along its sides. It is not therefore unreasonable to conclude that the whole chain of these hills, from Pinang to Singapore, has a strict geological connection. At Malacca hot springs exist, and the hills nearest to them are of the nature before mentioned. We naturally resort to the mountain chain of the interior for the seat of that central volcanic force of which the manifestations on these outskirts are of so peculiar a character, so\n\n* Cape Rachado is described by Crawfurd to consist of quartz rocks interspersed with frequent veins of clay iron-ore.\nwide in their extent, yet so devoid of intensity. But we find that there is no evidence whatever of any volcanoes ever having existed in this chain. If there ever were any, their fires have long been quenched.\n\nIf we now direct our attention to the southward of Singapore, we find that it is but one of an extensive archipelago of islands, stretching to the south-east, and which, after a slight interruption, is continued in Banca. That the geological chain continues to the latter island, is clear from the account which Dr. Horsfield gives of it. According to him, the elevated parts of Banca consist principally of granite, but in the secondary elevations \"red ironstone\" is extensively distributed in single rocks, or in veins of many united together, covering large tracts of country.* This circumstance and the general topography of the island, as described by Dr. Horsfield, assimilate to Singapore. The paucity of tin-ore in the latter arises from the want of granitic hills. Bukit Temah, the only hill yet explored in which sienite abounds, contains tin, and in fact derives its name from the circumstance, as it literally signifies \"Tin Hill.\" We thus find that what we may call the semi-volcanic band of the Straits of Malacca may, to a certain extent, be disconnected from the peninsula, and viewed as a chain of islands extending probably from Junk-Ceylon to Banca, and including the existing islands and numerous rocks and reefs in the Straits of Malacca. It appears, therefore, that its southern extremity is almost in contact with Sumatra,\u2020 and the question arises whether its volcanic connection be not with this great island rather than the peninsula. May it not be reasonably presumed that, if the origin and partial elevation of the Sumatra chain was contemporaneous with that of the peninsula, the line of greatest intensity of the subterranean forces, in whichever it was originally, was ultimately determined to the latter chain, and that at some now ancient era the former was left to comparative repose? The height of the plutonic mountains of the peninsula is greatly inferior to that of the mountains of Sumatra. But all the elevated peaks of the latter appear to be volcanic, and perhaps the purely granitic ranges are not more elevated than those of the peninsula. The elevation of the two plutonic ranges, and the shallow bed of the strait between\n\n* See \"Memoirs of Sir S. Raffles,\" p. 150. Major Court, in his account of Banca, notices the gravelly nature of the soil (Court's Palembang). Professor Jameson, in Murray's \"Encyclopaedia of Geography,\" mentions the circumstance of the primitive mountains being immediately bounded by a formation of red ironstone doubtfully, and adds, \"Crawfurd, who makes this statement, gives no description of the formation.\" From Crawfurd's meagre notice of Banca, I presume he does not write from personal observation, and, like Sir S. Raffles, he probably derived his information from Dr. Horsfield's manuscript.\n\n\u2020 It will appear, however, in the paper formerly referred to, that this approximation is due to modern external, not to ancient internal forces.\nthem, may have been contemporaneous and antecedent to the period when volcanoes burst out along the Sumatra chain. These volcanoes, from their number and power, would arrest the rise of the region, or cause any subsequent elevatory movement to be rare and of small amount. Until the interior of the peninsula is explored, these inquiries to a large extent must be merely speculative; but it is certain that the Sumatra chain has in recent eras been the seat of great volcanic energy, and that it is still subject to convulsive movements, the tremors or undulations of which are transmitted as far as what I have termed the semi-volcanic band of the Straits on the one side, and which are felt much more severely in the less distant chain of islands on the west coast of Sumatra.\n\nMarsden states that a number of volcanoes exist,* and describes one which opened in the side of a mountain about twenty miles inland of Bencoolen, and which, during his residence at that factory, scarcely ever failed to emit smoke. To the S.E. the three volcanic peaks of Gunong Dempo, Lumut, and Berapi, rise to the height of 12,000 feet. Gunong Dempo was ascended by Mr. Church, the present resident councillor at Singapore, with the late Mr. Presgrave, in 1818. An interesting account of the ascent is inserted in Rafles' Memoirs (p. 323). Mr. Presgrave states that he had frequently seen smoke issuing from the mountain, and the natives informed him that, within their memory, it had emitted flames attended with a loud noise. In the upper region of the mountain the party found the trees dead, and externally burned quite black. Further north is the great central volcanic region, partially at least included in the ancient kingdom of Menang Kabu. This is described by Raffles (Memoirs, p. 347) as being exclusively volcanic. The rocks are mostly basaltic. Two lofty volcanic mountains rise near the large lake of Sincara. From one of these, Gunong Berapi (Fiery Mountain), which is above 13,000 feet high, smoke issued. Hot springs also exist here. To the east of the lake the rocks consisted of felspar, granite, quartz, &c., mixed with a great variety of volcanic productions in the greatest confusion. Iron-ore of various kinds lay in the path of the travellers. To the west of the lake were found granite, marble, great varieties of limestones, masses of calcareous spar, and many other substances. On the N.E. of the lake, near Pageruyang, numerous stumps and trunks of trees in a state of petrifaction protruded from the ground. The limits of the region on the north and south are not ascertained. About sixty miles south of Mount Talong, another Gunong Berapi occurs. Near Mount Ophir, a volcanic mountain is marked in Marsden's map, and Mount Ophir itself is probably an extinct volcano. Further north still lies another of the\n\n* \"History of Sumatra,\" p. 24.\nascertained volcanoes, Mount Batagapit. Mr. J. Anderson, who visited the east coast in 1823, mentions* a native tradition of an engagement having taken place between two of the mountains in the interior of Delli (Sebaya and Senaban), when part of them fell into the valley. From these mountains, sulphur is procured, which if it does not prove that they are formed of volcanic materials, as Mr. Anderson conceives, at least leads to the inference that they have been the seat of volcanic action. At Acheen, abundant supplies of sulphur for internal consumption and exportation are obtained from a volcanic mountain in the neighbourhood.\u2020\n\nLastly, one of the western chain of islands, Si Beero, according to Marsden, possesses a volcano. Earthquakes are of frequent occurrence. Marsden notices one of unusual severity, which occurred in 1770.\u2021\n\nSir T. S. Raffles mentions that on the east coast they are said to happen every five or six years.\u00a7 The Malays on the east coast represented to Mr. Anderson that slight shocks were occasionally felt.|| and the same information was received by Lieut. Crooke at Jambi.\u00b6 In the interesting memoir on this state by that officer appended to Mr. Anderson's work it is likewise mentioned that a violent earthquake was stated to have been experienced about twenty years or more previous to his visit in 1820, and to have been preceded by a period of great heat and drought, which ruined the crops and occasioned a distressing scarcity of food. It is not improbable that this earthquake was simultaneous with one which happened in 1797, of which the effect on the opposite coast is mentioned by Raffles. \"It is stated that the vibratory shocks continued for three minutes, and recurred at intervals during the space of three hours, till the shock completely ceased. At Padang, the houses of the inhabitants were almost entirely destroyed and the public works much damaged. A vessel lying\n\n* \"Mission to the E. Coast of Sumatra,\" p. 199.\n\u2020 Marsden, p. 313.\n\u2021 \"The most severe that I have known was chiefly experienced in the district of Manna, in the year 1770. A village was destroyed by the houses falling down and taking fire, and several lives were lost. The ground was in one place rent a quarter of a mile, the width of two fathoms and depth of four or five. A bituminous matter is described to have swelled over the sides of the cavity, and the earth, for a long time after the shocks, was observed to contract and dilate alternately. Many parts of the hills far inland could be distinguished to have given way, and a consequence of this was, that during three weeks, Manna River was so much impregnated with particles of clay, that the natives could not bathe in it. At this time was formed, near to the mouth of Padang Goochie, a neighbouring river, south of the former, a large plain, seven miles long and half a mile broad, where there had been before only a narrow beach. The quantity of earth brought down on this occasion was so considerable that the hill upon which the English Resident's house stands, appears, from indubitable marks, less elevated by fifteen feet than it was before the event.\" (Id. p. 25.)\n\u00a7 \"Memoirs,\" p. 295.\n|| Anderson, ut supra, p. 199.\n\u00b6 Id. p. 402.\nat anchor was thrown by the sudden rise of the tide upwards of three miles on shore. The number of lives lost there amounted to above 300; of these, some were crushed under the ruins of falling houses, some were literally entombed by the earth opening on them, and others were drowned by the sudden irruption of the waters of the ocean.\"\n\nOn April 18, 1818, another violent earthquake was experienced on the west coast. Sir T. S. Raffles, who arrived at Bencoolen the day after, found that every house was more or less shattered, and many in ruins. In the island of Pulo Nias, on the west coast, earthquakes appear to be felt very severely. The same remark may possibly apply to the other islands in the same chain, for our knowledge of these phenomena in the native countries has been hitherto almost entirely accidental, and our information regarding Pulo Nias arises from the connection of Europeans with it. Marsden mentions that in 1763 a village in that island was swallowed up by an earthquake, and a recent shock, which will be immediately noticed more at large, was still more disastrous in its effects. That the undulations in most cases extend across the straits to the semi-volcanic line is highly probable. Although our connection with the Straits now extends over a period of sixty years, unfortunately no connected records have been preserved of the critical geological and meteorological phenomena that have been experienced during that time. In Pinang during the last twelve years several shocks have been felt. These occurred in November 1833, August 1835, September 1837, and January 1843.*\n\nThose of 1837 were the most violent, and the undulations appear to have been from south to north, and to have lasted a minute and a half.\u2020 The shocks in 1843 happened about half an hour after midnight on the morning of January 6, and at half-past two p.m. on the 8th. The first shock was more severe than the second, but both were slight, producing no other mechanical effects than a tremor of the ground, which caused articles sus-\n\n* Pinang Gazette of January 7, 14, and 28, 1843.\n\n\u2020 \"It is said that on that occasion several herds of cattle in the neighbourhood were observed running in the utmost confusion in all directions, that lamps and picture frames oscillated, that the Roman Catholic church bell rang of its own accord, that quantities of large shot piled up in the fort were thrown down and scattered about, that a stone wall of a substantial building in town was rent, and that the whole inhabitants were thrown into a state of consternation. The shipping in the harbour did not experience this shock, nor did the sea appear agitated. Five days subsequently, however, another smart shock was felt, and was followed by a very heavy squall from the N.W., and great agitation and rise of the sea in the harbour. The tides overflowed the northern beach, and flooded the compounds and lower rooms of the houses in the neighbourhood. This convulsion was experienced about the same time at Aceh, and along the Pedier coast, and it is said that these places sustained considerable damage.\"\u2014Pinang Gazette of January 28, 1843.\npended to oscillate, stopped a clock, and occasioned in some persons a giddiness in the head. The first shock, although only felt by a few persons in the plain who happened to be awake, caused the residents on one of the hills to spring from their beds, under the apprehension that robbers had attacked their houses, so violent was the noise of rattling venetians, bolts, &c. The undulations on this occasion, as in 1837, appeared to be from south to north. The shock on the morning of the 6th was experienced precisely at the same instant at Singapore* and at Malacca.\u2020 The undulations at Singapore are said to have been from east to west, very slight, and to have lasted eight or ten seconds. About half a year afterwards it was first learned in the Straits that a most violent earthquake had devastated Pulo Nias, commencing about midnight between January 5 and 6, or nearly the same time when the undulations were felt along the western coast of the peninsula. The shocks were at first from the west, shifting to the north; but as they increased in violence they appeared to lose any fixed direction and became a complete trembling of the earth, which lasted nine minutes; houses were destroyed, trees uprooted, a portion of a mountain fell, and the ground opened in wide fissures, from which a \"black frothy liquid trickled.\" After a brief interval of inaction, the undulations recommenced, and the sea suddenly rose in a vast wave, which rolled in from the south-east, overwhelming a considerable tract of country and sweeping away whole villages and their inhabitants. The shocks were felt at intervals of two minutes until half-past four in the morning, when another paroxysm even more violent than the first took place, lasting about six minutes. The shocks were from the west, veering to the north, but changing directly to the south. Tremors of the ground were experienced for several subsequent days. Thus the latest earthquake that has occurred in this region was experienced in its greatest violence a little to the west of the volcanic chain of Sumatra, and the undulations were transmitted or induced so widely and so rapidly as to reach Penang, Malacca and Singapore simultaneously and at or about the same time when the first shock was felt at Pulo Nias.\n\nIt appears, therefore, that the volcanoes of Sumatra still communicate with an internal igneous sea, and from time to time emit smoke and gases: that to this day the island is subject to frequent earthquakes; that several of those that have occurred within the last hundred years have been of great force, rending the ground, and at least on two occasions giving vent to liquid volcanic matter; and that their operation extends, though with diminished violence, to the western coast of the peninsula. When we consider the height and bulk of the crateriform volcanic\n\n* Singapore Free Press of January 12, 1843. \u2020 Id. February 2, 1843.\nmountains, even viewed only relatively to the level of the hilly country above which they rise, and the large belts of volcanic rocks which exist in the neighbourhood of some of those that have been explored, if they do not connect the whole chain, we are carried back to a period in the history of Sumatra during which its volcanic phenomena were on the grandest scale. If at this day, when the fires of her mountains have ceased or are dormant, the coast of the peninsula is agitated by the comparatively feeble shocks which disturb the repose of the island, it is reasonable to believe that when her volcanoes, whether simultaneously, successively, or alternately, were in full activity along a line of nearly a thousand miles, the neighbouring regions to the distance of 100 to 200 miles must have been subject to earthquakes of great violence, and accompanied, according to the degree of their intensity, by volcanic emissions and eruptions in greater or less abundance.\n\nThat portion of the volcanic belt where the evidences of violent igneous action are most striking appears to be Singapore and the neighbourhood, although it is not improbable that the whole tract, from Cape Rachado to Banca, exhibits more extensive and continuous disturbance than the northern part of the belt. That region of Sumatra which, so far as observation has extended, may be termed the principal volcanic tract, is about three degrees distant from Singapore, and lies in a parallel about a degree and a quarter to the south of this island. The direction of the Singapore strata is across or approximately at right angles to parallel lines forming the sides of a plane connecting the island with this part of Menangkabu, and the dip of the strata, although, as formerly observed, exhibiting much irregularity, is generally from the point of the compass where Menangkabu lies.\n\nThere seems, upon the whole, to be strong grounds for the opinion that the hill system of Singapore has its volcanic* connection with Sumatra, and not with the mountain chain of the peninsula. If this view shall be found to be borne out by further\n\n* Our meagre information regarding the formations of Sumatra does not admit of our instituting a comparison between them and the rocks of the opposite coast of the Peninsula. The central mountains are chiefly plutonic and volcanic. The granite or sienite of the southern regions would appear from Marsden's slight notice to resemble that of Singapore. The lower tracts of the west coast, as described by him, possess a remarkable resemblance in their configuration to the surface of Singapore. Like the latter, they consist of rounded elevations of no great height, separated by winding flat swamps penetrating for miles between them. The hills \"not unfrequently exhibit the appearance of an amphitheatre.\" A coincidence in a configuration so uncommon when other analogies are also considered, can hardly be viewed as accidental. The soil he describes as a stiff reddish clay. The rock exposed in sea cliffs and in some places at the bottoms of rivers is a species of clay called by the natives \"nappal,\" which is common in Singapore. The country between the mountains and the eastern coast of Sumatra is little known, but what information has been obtained respecting its geological features I have collected in the paper before alluded to.\nobservations, we must conceive that the old granite mountain chain of the peninsula (which, as is shown in the paper before mentioned, terminates apparently between Parcelar Point and Pulo Varela, although a few minor groups exist in the interior to the southward) had its extremity in this direction washed by the sea. The region below, which operated the expansive volcanic fluids or gases whose effects we are considering, extended from Sumatra to the peninsula, and probably a little to the westward of the one and considerably to the eastward of the other, for the whole vast platform or partially emerging and partially subsiding continent that rises out of the depths of the Indian Ocean and stretches eastward far into the Pacific, rests on one region of connected though shifting subterranean excitement. The line of most intense force would be the ordinary one, the volcanic chain of Sumatra. Thence the waves of the volcanic sea would travel in parallel lines to the north-eastward, causing a tension of the region and a tendency to split in the direction of those lines. That portion of the region intermediate between the western and eastern mountain chains which had not been disturbed and fractured during the process of elevation like that from which the chains were obtruded, or of which the fractures had not reached the surface, would offer most resistance. But on arriving at the western limit of the old fractures caused during the elevation of the Malayan chain, the space so fractured would yield in various points of weakness. The old fractures at the southern extremity of the chain would by the tension be prolonged in the same direction, that is to the S.E., and cross fractures being established and the volcanic forces sufficing to elevate the rocks and produce eruptions at different places along the line of fissure, the system of semi-volcanic hills extending from the termination of the Malayan plutonic chain to Banca would be produced. Whether we admit the notion of a translation of waves, or suppose that under the region a general volcanic pressure was in operation, producing an expansive tendency whose superficial manifestations varied according to the mineral structure and composition of the rocky crust and particular local intensity of force, the same results would follow under the assigned conditions.\n\nHaving in the above paper had occasion to bring together several scattered notices of recent volcanic action in Sumatra and the west coast of the peninsula, it may be remarked that some general facts appear which it may be useful to separate from the local matters with which they are mixed up.\n\n1. The advance of a great wave upon the land is a circumstance common to most earthquakes on sea-coasts. Mr. Darwin considers it to be caused by a line of fracture beneath the sea. If there is a consequent sinking of the sea-bed along the line, the\nrush of waters on both sides to restore the level would occasion first the retirement of the sea from the shore, and then the production of a wave rolling in upon the shore. But might it not also be caused without any sinking or even rending of the sea-bed? A strong blow beneath the earth's crust, imparting a momentary centrifugal tendency, would cause the sea above the point or line of impact to rise violently to a height proportioned to the force of the concussion. But this wave would necessarily be partly above and partly below the general level, or have a hollow on each side towards which the neighbouring waters would rush, and thus the same effect be produced along the adjacent coast as in the former case. Mr. Darwin also mentions that places situated on shallow bays suffer great damage from these waves, while those seated close to the edge of profoundly deep water escape. In the same manner the waves of the Indian Ocean, on reaching the shallow coast of Sumatra, rise as they advance until they acquire a great height. This is probably attributable to the friction of the bottom retarding the waves, while a constant succession press on from the sea behind. When bays are narrow, the wave will have a greater tendency to rise owing to its progressive lateral contraction, as is seen more markedly in bores.\n\n2. The opening of fissures and evacuation through them of black fluid matter. The spasmodic expansion and contraction of fissures continued after the shock.\n\n3. The disruption of portions of mountains or landslips.\n\n4. The elevation of tracts of land.\n\n5. The greater violence of earthquakes on hills. This was observed at Pinang in 1843. Marsden remarks that houses situated on a low sandy soil are least affected, and those which stand on distinct hills suffer most from the shocks.\n\n6. The connection between earthquakes and the condition of the atmosphere. To what is stated by Lieut. Crooke respecting the great drought which preceded the earthquake at Jambi, the following extract from Marsden relative to Sumatran earthquakes in general may be added:\u2014\"Earthquakes have been remarked by some to happen usually on sudden changes of weather, and particularly after violent heats; but I do not vouch this upon my own experience, which has been pretty ample.\" The earthquake of 1843 occurred during one of the longest and severest droughts that had ever happened in Pinang. This drought, which was attended with oppressive heat and occasional hot winds, never before experienced within the memory of the residents, appears to have extended over the northern part of Sumatra.\nNOTE.\n\nWhen the foregoing paper was written I had not seen the talented and elaborate memoir on Indian earthquakes by Lieutenant R. B. Smith, which I received by the Hooghly. The portions at which I have had time to glance suffice to show that it contains a mine of wealth. The above notices of Malayan earthquakes, however meagre, may serve to connect his researches with the Indian Archipelago respecting the general geology and recent volcanic disturbances of which I am collecting information. Meantime the subjoined account which has been furnished me by my brother, abridged from the official report of the Alcalde Mayor of the province of Cagayan in the island of Luzon, of an earthquake attended by the subsidence of two hills and by a violent hurricane which occurred there on the night between October 7 and 8 last, may prove interesting. It will appear in the Singapore Free Press, but I presume that will form no objection to its being put on record in the more permanent pages of the Journal.\n\n\"The Casa Real of Lallo, a brick building, and one of the most solid edifices in the province, was destroyed. The rector's house was destroyed, and the roof of the church suffered much damage, and many other of the public edifices were more or less injured. The Tribunal stood it out well, and will only require a new roof. All the wooden houses were levelled with the ground. None of the attap houses escaped, and the greater part were blown over with many of their unhappy owners in them, and their little stores of paddy. The people, notwithstanding, had been since occupied in repairing the serious injuries which the Renta de Tabacos had suffered, and the wages, which were paid daily, served as some consolation to them in the midst of so much misfortune. Five persons are reckoned to have been killed and eleven wounded. In Calamaningan, the church and rector's house were entirely destroyed, and the priest was living in the Royal Tribunal, which had escaped injury, and in which he had erected an altar. The wooden houses suffered more than those of Lallo. The attap houses were all destroyed. The people experienced the misfortune of being caught by the hurricane with the greater part of their grain still on the ground, the whole of which was destroyed. Eleven persons were killed, and twenty seriously injured. At Aparri, the majority of the houses in the district are of wood, which were mostly all destroyed. The Royal Tribunal, a new and solid building, was overthrown; the rector's house destroyed, and the church much injured. Nearly all the wooden houses were destroyed, and none of the attap ones escaped, the greater part going to block up the river or into the sea, which rose into the village and contributed to make the night more frightful, and to\naugment the number of victims, who amounted to twenty-seven killed and fifty-three wounded. All the harvest that had been gathered in perished, being carried into the sea with the houses. The destruction of buffaloes, horses, cows, and other property was excessive. In Buguey nearly all houses and buildings were destroyed; one man killed. The convent of Abulog was entirely demolished, the church lost its roof and belfry, and nearly all the houses were levelled with the ground: eight persons were killed. To the north of this village, at the distance of six miles, there is a high hill on the top of which dwelt a number of natives who pay allegiance to Her Majesty. These people relate that on the evening preceding the hurricane they felt great and frequent tremblings of the earth; that at nightfall they began to hear in the midst of it a frightful noise, which impelled them to abandon their abode, and fly, full of fear, to a creek for shelter from the fury of the tempest, which was increasing. On the ceasing of the storm, on the morning of the 8th, they returned to their dwelling, when they found that it, and the hill on which it stood, had sunk; there appeared in its place a large lake of black water, of a fetid odour, and smoking. In Pamplona, the churches and Tribunal were destroyed, as well as the rest of the houses, with the exception of the church of the division of Masi, which being of very solid construction, escaped with trifling injury: five persons were killed. At the entrance of the river of this village there was a hill sixty feet high separating the sea from the river, which, having disappeared, the two waters are now joined, and a wide and practicable passage opened: five victims are reported. Within the boundaries of all these districts Nature presents a most sombre picture; not a single green tree is to be seen, the thickest trunks alone remaining, and these as if only left at last to show that vegetation had ceased; which is no doubt owing to the great quantity of electricity with which the atmosphere was charged during the hurricane.\"\n\nExtract from a letter to Professor Ansted, Vice-Secretary of the Geological Society of London, dated Malacca, February 4, 1847.\n\nSubsequently to the date of the above paper, finding that but a slow and unsatisfactory progress could be made by land, I availed myself of the natural vertical sections afforded by the shores of Singapore, and the smaller islands into which the southern extremity of the peninsula range is broken, and was thus soon in possession of a body of facts which gave a certainty and consistency to the above views. I minutely examined the islands of Pulo Brani, Blakan Mati, Sikukur, and Sikijang on the one side; and Pulo 'Ubin, Pulo Tikong Besar, Pulo Tikong Kechil, Sejahat Besar and Kechil, &c., on the other side. I also explored the\nneighbouring coasts of the peninsula and the banks of the Johore River. The result was, that I found the foregoing hypothesis, so far as it had been developed, to be substantially an expression of the facts. It had, however, given too much prominence to some modes of the volcanic or semi-volcanic action, and too little to others. Thus, although there has been a certain degree of eruption in some cases where the gases in forcing their way to the surface have excited an unusual mechanical force, their action has, in general, been limited to a partial reduction and metamorphosis of the rock in the zones or dykes through which they have passed up [or in those larger tracts beneath which the surface of the plutonic sea has risen to such high subterraneous levels that the whole superincumbent matter has been saturated by its exhalations. I have also noticed several facts which appear to require us to believe that some portions at least of Singapore were under water at the time when the gaseous action first reached the surface. The vast abundance of hydrated peroxide of iron, and the mode in which ancient ferruginated breccias and conglomerates sometimes occur, would be most simply explained by this hypothesis. The circumstances adverted to in the paper on this subject must be borne in mind. In some places a considerable quantity of matter derived from the hills has been deposited in the intervening valleys, probably at or soon after the time of elevation, and been subsequently covered up by modern sea mud, on which mangroves have rooted and spread].\n\nThe most difficult branch of the inquiry has been the relation between the volcanic action to which the sedimentary rocks have been subjected, and the crystalline rocks which are associated with them. But, disregarding this for the present, and considering the volcanic action apart from any hypothesis of its origin or its relations, and reasoning from its visible effects, we may lay down this position absolutely, that the whole region in question (and a much wider one, as it will be found, extending to the lower ranges of the Himalayas, a large part of Australia, a part of Africa, &c.) has been exposed to a well-marked and peculiar, perhaps a unique,* \n\n* This I had been very slow to believe, because although there may be places where a fossil fauna or flora altogether peculiar is found, it is scarcely conceivable that any plutonic action should have an entirely local character, or that one repeated over so many parts of an extensive region in Asia, should not hitherto have been observed by geologists in Europe or America. I have, however, read nearly every English work on geology without meeting a description of any considerable development of rocks in those quarters of the globe resembling our laterites, and have consequently been obliged to work out their true theory with little help from books, and by dint of patient and minute observation. A few months ago I was led to think that English writers were too much occupied in establishing their own opinions to present a full view of those of continental geologists, and that the latter were leaving them behind in the science of rocks of injection, reduction, and eruption. It appeared necessary, therefore, to gather their views from their own explanations of them. In\nigneous action. It has varied in its intensity and mode of operation, but everywhere certain prevailing characters demonstrate its unity. These are both chemical and mechanical, the first depending principally on the never-failing presence of iron, and the latter evinced by the extraordinary uniformity in the shapes, ramifications, and even sizes of the ranges in which the rocks affected have been raised. Whatever be the nature of the original sedimentary strata, this mighty agent has impressed them with the same marks, and the more powerful its grasp has been the more have their native peculiarities been confounded. But between the effects of this intensest force, and that so weak that we barely detect its touch, the degrees are almost infinite. Still, the only way in which I can render this slight immethodical sketch at all intelligible will be to note a few of the better marked disguises which the rocks assume under this potent influence. I say disguises, because the geology of the Malay Peninsula almost wholly resolves itself into the identification of the original rock under its multiplex transformations. Without a key to this, derived from a minute examination and comparison of the modes of alteration, the whole is a dark riddle, or our geology becomes a congeries of bewildered gropings and sheer mistakes.\n\nThe first or lowest degree of alteration, let us say in a clay, is the formation of isolated blotches of a reddish colour in the rock, but unaccompanied by any other apparent change.\n\nSecond, a slight comparative hardness in the blotches.\n\nThird, in addition a grittiness\u2014they may now be termed nodules or concretions, and we may include in this catalogue all degrees from an incipient grittiness to a hard compact character, which gives the nodule the appearance of an imbedded pebble. [The nodules are sometimes hard and compact without being gritty or quartzose, and they are gritty in their nascent state where the rock is originally arenaceous in any degree.]\n\nthe first work which I ordered, and which I received two days ago by the overland mail, I found an allusion to a district in Europe which has been described by an eminent French geologist, and which, if I may judge from the few lines in which it is referred to, must be in many respects analogous to the lateritic tracts of the Malay Peninsula, and consequently of India, &c., also. In a few months I hope to have the means of ascertaining whether this is the fact, and also whether in the writings of other continental geologists any similar tracts are noticed. A few days ago Mr. Balestier put into my hands a letter which he had received from one of the gentlemen attached to the recent French embassy to China, a pupil of the celebrated chemist Dumas, in which he explains the views of himself and another member of the embassy on the geology of Singapore. His theory of the origin of the laterite had occurred to me when I first began to suspect its real nature. As my observations extended and became more minute, I found that such a theory only explained a small part of the phenomena, and that which I have now held for about two years gradually developed itself, growing clearer and simpler in proportion as it embraced wider ranges of facts.\u2014J. R. L., March 16, 1847.\nFourth, the nodules bulge out at different points, and the preceding three degrees may be repeated in nodules of this shape.\n\nFifth, the arms or branches unite so that the rock is pervaded by a complete congeries or ramification of red, rounded, but irregularly shaped branches. The form of these branches varies very much, but is generally uniform for a considerable space. Very frequently it is as if ginger roots were continued in all directions. At other times the spaces between the ramifications are narrow sinuous perforations or isolated vesicles or deep straight tubes, or chambers in tubes. This structure is sometimes the result of an allied or predisposing structure in the rock affected, and at other times it appears to be wholly superinduced by the altering agency. In this last form the red portion is found of various degrees of hardness, but not so soft as the first degree. In general it possesses a medium degree of hardness, so as to be cut with an axe.*\n\nSixth. In this class we may include the products of all degrees of heat that has been suddenly applied in sufficient force to produce calcination, and this distinguishes it from all the preceding, in which the rock has been merely impregnated with hot ferruginous gases or vapours\u2014where the calcination has not been great the original structure of the rock is better preserved than in the merely impregnated rock, because in the latter the indurating action of the iron, the different degrees of its oxidation when it comes within the influence of water and air, and the washing out of the softer portions in the hollows, often give it an amygdaloidal or vesicular structure totally different from that of the original rock; a slight roasting on the other hand preserves the latter, and saves it from meteoric destruction. The limit of this preserving power is soon reached, and every higher degree of heat and larger infusion of iron exerts in each rock a corresponding destructive or altering power, and approaches nearer that point where the original differences in the rocks cease to be distinguishable. The extreme limits of this class appear to be where the rock is merely scorched on the surface, preserving its original character beneath, and where it is thoroughly reduced to a cinder. This class of rocks very frequently present mamillated and botryoidal surfaces. It occurs in dykes and on the sides of fissures through which hot blasts appear to have rushed. It also occurs in an outer layer or thick crust over rocks of the fifth class, in which case it would appear that the different effects produced by the same gas arose from the upper crust being exposed to the air and consequently burnt. In the same way the calcination to some depth on the sides of fissures may have arisen in certain cases, not from the gas that rushed through them being hotter than that in the body of\n\n* It hardens on free exposure to the atmosphere and is used in building.\nthe rock (though this was most likely the fact in general), but from the presence of air producing combustion. Between dykes of this last class, rocks altered in the above fifth degree are common; but dykes of the fifth degree also occur. The difference in every case will depend on the relative intensity of the heat and degree of ferrugination of the gas, and the fact whether there was air to support combustion or not.\n\nThe preceding remarks are applicable chiefly to rocks either composed of clay or in which there is a basis of clay. But a very small proportion of clay suffices for the exhibition of the above modes of action. When the rock is wholly arenaceous, nodules are not formed. The rock is reduced to a dry incoherent or friable mass where the action has been slight. Where it has been greater, a network of cracks pervades the rocks, and the seams have either a thin plate of blackish ferruginous crust included between them, or their sides have a similar thin coating which is often covered with an exceedingly minute mamillation. In some cases the matter between the seams or ferruginous walls has been dissipated, and the rock appears as a black honeycomb. In all instances of high calcination the sandstone is greatly indurated. It is sometimes converted into a crystalline rock.\n\nFriable shales, again, are sometimes changed into a dry powdery matter resembling volcanic ash.\n\nWhere the bodies of the strata are not altered, their planes of junction are sometimes slightly indurated and mamillated. The gas in every case has taken the readiest channels to the surface, and where fissures have not assisted its emission, it has forced itself through the planes of least cohesion, such as the junction planes of different beds, cleavage planes, &c. It thus often exposes the internal structure of the rock where it would otherwise appear compact. The composition of the rock has often had a great influence in determining the channel of emission, so that its action sometimes is chiefly confined to one or more strata, the adjoining beds appearing to be little if at all affected.\n\nQuartz frequently accompanies the ferruginous change, but rarely to a considerable extent.\n\nThe above are the most common modes of alteration, but there are others approaching nearer to true metamorphism. Clay is converted into a porcellaneous or jaspidious substance\u2014sandstone into a hard siliceous flinty substance. Conglomerates and breccias have frequently a base of this nature.*\n\nThe mechanical force accompanying the evolution of the hot ferruginous gases or vapours has been great, but it has been exerted within narrow limits. Thus the strata are often vertical,\n\n* I have since found on the eastern coast of Pulo Krimin Kichil (the little Carimon) great masses of clays and conglomerates transformed into a perfect crystalline chert as hard as flint.\u2014J. R. L.\nand generally rise at high angles, but the dip varies much, and even in adjacent hills of the same connected range is sometimes reversed. Yet they are never raised more than a few hundred feet above the common basal level, and the majority of the almost innumerable hillocks which compose the ranges of Singapore are probably rather under than above 100 feet. At the southern extremity of the western St. John's (Pulo Sikijang) two adjoining hills have been formed by strata being bent into a convex shape, rising only a few feet above the level of the beach. There is a remarkable approach to uniformity in the strike of all the strata and in the direction of the hill ranges. Speaking generally, it may be said to approximate to N.W.\u2014S.E. The hills have commonly mamillary surfaces. The ranges may be said to consist of distinct hills bulging out and united at their sides. The central hills are generally the more bulky. Lateral hills ramify on each side to a short distance. The whole connected system is disposed in a symmetrical rameose manner, indicating a wonderful uniformity in the mode of operation of the dynamical forces which produced them. The investigation of the forms of these hills, and of the laws of the mechanical forces of which they are the result, assumes a high interest and importance when we find that these forms are not confined to Singapore, but are repeated in low hill ranges over large portions of the peninsula, Sumatra, Southern India, Northern India, Northern Australia, &c., and accompanied, as I believe, by volcanic phenomena of exactly the same nature as those which I have described. I do not say that the phenomena are identical at all points. In Singapore itself they vary almost infinitely. But they are always analogous, frequently the same, and to my mind are undoubtedly the product of one well-marked species of volcanic* action.\n\nI should not omit to notice the frequent occurrence, in those ranges which have been most burnt, of mounds or monticules of scorious blocks, sometimes on the summits, and sometimes bulging out from the sides of hills. The ridges and angles of hills appear frequently to present scorious blocks.\n\nThe valleys between the long hill ranges are in Singapore perfectly flat, so that they display the outlines of the bases of the ranges almost as well as if they still remained what they were at no very remote period, long narrow inlets of the sea. This circumstance also is not confined to Singapore.\n\nI will now briefly notice the nature of the sedimentary rocks\n\n* In reference to the igneous changes which the rocks have undergone, I use the words volcanic and plutonic indiscriminately, because a minute examination of some of the best marked developments of crystalline rocks (graduating from basaltic to granitic types) at the extremity of the peninsula, has led me to think that though the distinction is useful and appropriate in some regions, the theory which it expresses is not sound as a general one\u2014at least as expounded by many geologists.\nwhich have been more or less altered and elevated in the modes I have mentioned. If you think it worth while, you can, I dare say, procure a copy of Mr. Thomson's chart of Singapore Straits from the Admiralty for reference. It would scarcely be advisable at present to attempt to make a geological map. The southern portion of the island (including the town, the adjacent district to the N.W.; the ranges between the road from the town to Bukit Timah, the central and highest hill, and the sea to the S.W.), and the islands of Blakan Mati, Pulo Brani, St. John's, &c., are composed of shales, clays, sandstones and conglomerates, the shales predominating. It is impossible to refer these rocks to any place in your European systems, as no organic remains have yet been discovered, and the only rocks with which they are associated are hypogene. In their general appearance and mineralogical characters they agree with the aluminous and arenaceous beds of the new red sandstone. Between the parallel of strike passing through the town and the steep Tulloh Blangan range, there is an area about a mile in breadth, stretching from the sea inland over the Tanjong Pagar and Tanghir districts, and of course in a direction approaching to N.W., and in the opposite direction, including Pulo Brani and the eastern portion of Blakan Mati, composed in great measure of shale strata, although a few of sandstone also occur. The prevailing colours of the shale beds are dull violet, liver brown, and chocolate. Beds of the most lively variegated colours sometimes occur mottled, striped, damasked, &c.; the colours are white, yellow, orange, red, violet, purple, green, bluish, and blackish, in addition to the dull violet and chocolate. To the N.E. of this tract sandstone is more frequently interstratified. To the S.W. sandstones, grits, and coarse conglomerates prevail; and these are continued, interstratified, however, with some shales, from the range along the coast of Tulloh Blangan through the western portion of Blakan Mati, and through Sikukur and Sikijang (St. John's), in a south-westerly zone. I have not yet pursued this zone farther across the strait, but the island of Sambo, on the other side, is a continuation of the same parallel of elevation, and may consist of the same rocks. To the N.E. of the town a large alluvial plain sweeps into the country. The hills around it are principally arenaceous. The arenaceous band, however, on the N.W. of the plain merely skirts it. Beyond this band (and succeeding the sandstone ranges to the N.E. of the shale tract first noticed) a broad zone of clayey hills, of which the boundaries are irregular, but which may be from three to four miles in breadth, stretches through the heart of the island of Bukit Timah, and thence across to the Silat Tambroh, or old Strait of Singapore, behind the island. The tract to the S.W. of this, stretching from the parallel of the S.W. boundary of the shale band to the S.W. point of the island\n(Tanjong G\u00fal). is composed principally of sandstone and shale, but granitic bases and ranges also occur. The great clay tract I believe to consist in large measure of decomposed hypogene rocks\u2014sienitic and granitic chiefly (it has only, however, been partially examined or laid open). Blocks of these rocks are seen at the surface in some of the hills, and the sections made by roads so exactly resemble decomposed crystalline rocks, that I have no doubt the whole of the clay hills are at bottom hypogene rocks. Their structure and composition I believe to be very variable. This tract is continued over a considerable part of the rest of the island to the N.E., but a large tract of sandstone (accompanied by a very little shale) stretches into it.\n\nThe coast boundary of this tract is a line of about four miles, extending along the south-eastern shore of the island from Siglap to beyond T\u00e1nah Mera Bes\u00e1r (the Red Cliffs). It insulates the granitic N.E. projecting portion of the island at Changy, embraces the northern coast from the inner extremity of this promontory to the inner extremity of that of P\u00fangal, and then proceeds inland. The line of its junction on the N.W. with the granitic tract that surrounds it I have not yet ascertained, but it is probably irregular. On the S.W. it connects itself with the arenaceous band surrounding the plain previously mentioned, and indeed forms the larger portion of the boundary of the plain. It then stretches inland for some distance, having the S.E. projection of the great granite tract interposed between it and the arenaceous and shaley bands, first above noticed. P. 'Ubin is entirely hypogene, varying from granitic to compact types. Hornblende is largely developed. The structure of the rocks is highly curious and interesting. I have given much attention to this island, and in the beginning of September last sent a full account of it, and of the geological views to which it seemed to lead, to the Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen, in whose Transactions, the president writes me, it will appear. In this paper I had been led to some views with which I find Mr. Darwin had been occupied, and which are developed in the chapter on plutonic and metamorphic rocks in his geological observations on South America, of which, though bearing the same date as my paper, I did not receive a copy till about a fortnight ago. The germ of his ideas is, however, contained in his \"Volcanic Islands,\" which I have referred to in my paper. As I have also considered the subject from some other, and, as I believe, new points of view, I shall send you a copy of the paper in English, the \"Batavian Transactions\" being in Dutch.*\n\n* In a general descriptive sketch of some portion of the Straits of Malacca which I sent to the Geographical Society some time ago, I mentioned the singular grooved rocks at the Chinese Quarries on P. 'Ubin, and hazarded some conjectures respecting their origin; when I wrote that paper I had made only\nbehind P. 'Ubin consists of rocks some of which would be called plutonic and others volcanic, like those of Pulo 'Ubin, but the whole are undoubtedly of the same contemporaneous origin. At Runto, in the estuary of the Johore River, sandstone similar to that of the Singapore Red cliffs, and, like it, remarkable for being nearly horizontal, is exposed. Farther up the river the rocks exposed are of a decomposed felspathic character, and exactly resemble some of those of the hypogene tract of Singapore. At one place a hard ferruginous crust about nine inches thick overlaid a decomposed felspathic rock. Pulo Tikong Besar and Kechil consist chiefly of sandstones and in part of shales, often greatly altered by volcanic action. On the coast to the S.E. near Johore Hill, or at Tanjong Pingrang, are found within a small compass soft shale or clay\u2014clay indurated so as to resemble chert\u2014conglomerate highly indurated and partially transformed\u2014quartz rock, and traces of blackish brown slags, indicating various degrees and even some difference in the mode of the volcanic action.\n\nThe connection between the crystalline and sedimentary rocks of the district is susceptible of two explanations. We may either consider the former in their fluid or viscous state as having been the immediate agents of the volcanic and mechanical forces to which the latter have been subjected, or we may consider the former as the product of the first plutonic action beneath this region; the latter as sedimentary rocks subsequently accumulated [over them] during a period of quiescence, and their fracture, upheaval, and alteration as the effects of a new excitement to activity in the plutonic sea below, in which the old plutonic crust, with its sedimentary covering was broken and upheaved, and ferruginous or ferro-siliceous gases copiously emitted through the lines of fracture. On either supposition the ferruginous character of the emissions would be accounted for, because the upper granites, &c., contain much iron in their hornblende, and whether the mass below the granite crust had remained in its fluid state during the deposit of the sedimentary rocks, or had been wholly solidified and subsequently melted down anew, the gases given off from it, when vents were formed, would probably preserve the same character as those given off from its original surface before any granitic crust had been formed. I cannot stop now to explain how the prevailing plutonic theories, as applied to the phenomena of the district, seemed, at the time when the paper first mentioned was written, to require the adoption of the\n\none flying visit to the quarries and was under the impression that the deep channels were confined to this locality. My first geological visit subsequently at once undeceived me. In the paper forwarded to the Batavian Society I have shown how these channels have resulted from the original structure of the rock under ordinary decomposing and eroding influences.\nopinion that the granites, &c., were in existence when the volcanic action took place. Even under the influence of these theories I considered the point as very doubtful, and although it involved consequences irreconcilable with these theories, I ventured to hazard the conjecture that the upper hypogene rocks had been the immediate agents of the changes. The examination of Pilo 'Ubin shook my faith in these theories as expounded by some of their principal advocates, and the conjecture assumed a high degree of probability. Latterly I had all but embraced it, but still suspended its complete adoption in the hope that I would discover some phenomenon amounting to ocular proof of its truth.\n\nI have only another point to advert to before I come to Malacca. If you have taken any interest in Indian geology, you are doubtless acquainted with the rock called laterite which prevails so largely in Southern India, and is also found in Bengal, &c., and which to this day remains the most fertile subject of discord amongst Indian geologists, although the general opinion appears of late to have settled down in favour of its being a sedimentary deposit. In the paper first alluded to in this letter I made the following remarks with reference to laterite:\u2014\"Many of the clayey hills here [in Singapore] appear to me to be decomposed sienite, sometimes unaltered by supervening volcanic action, but generally partaking in the metamorphism which the matter of most of the elevated land has suffered from that cause.\"\n\nMay I venture to suggest that the hypothesis which is developed in this paper for Singapore, might, if applied to the laterite of India, perhaps explain its origin, and in doing so to a certain extent also reconcile the conflicting opinions that have been maintained regarding it? All that I have read of the great laterite formations of the south of India, and which extend to the heart of Bengal, where they are described by Dr. Buchanan Hamilton, leads to the conclusion that they are not purely volcanic, sedimentary, or decomposed matter, but what I have termed semi-volcanic. The same formation is found at Malacca, and analogous deposits occur at Singapore, and both are inseparably associated and evidently contemporaneous with altered rocks of the kind previously noticed. If we conceive an area with trap, granite, sandstone, shale, &c., exposed at the surface (in the atmosphere or in the sea), and partly decomposed or disintegrated, to be subjected to a peculiar species of minor volcanic action like that which is described in this paper* (the distinctive phenomenon, pro-\n\n* Whether the upper plutonic rocks were the direct sources of the igneous action, or were themselves, together with the sedimentary rocks acted on by a lower plutonic sea, does not affect my explanation of the formation of laterites; for whether I adopt the one or the other view of the source of the injections and impregnations which produced the laterites, or remain in doubt on the subject, the fact, deduced from the actual examination of these rocks, that they have been so produced, is not at all rendered doubtful.\nbably, of one and the same geological epoch), the results would be, that with the occasional exception of matter ejected from no great depth, and some dykes and veins, the previous soft surface rocks would be merely altered and metamorphosed by heat and impregnated with iron, derived perhaps from the basaltic and other ferriferous rocks through which the discharged steam, gases, and water had passed in their ascent. Whether the action took place under or above the sea would be determined by the presence or absence of the ordinary marks of oceanic denudation. When clays strongly ferruginous and soft from saturation with water, are dried, the iron previously held in solution by the water is deposited between the particles, and cements them into a hard compact rock. Hence the induration of laterite clays on exposure to the atmosphere.\" My opinion therefore was that, though proper laterite was nothing more than one of the forms of alteration produced by plutonic ferruginous gases\u2014that which, in the arbitrary scale formerly given, I have called the fifth degree\u2014and that any rock in which a sufficient quantity of clay was present, whether it were purely sedimentary or a decomposed crystalline or compact rock, or whatever its origin or character in other respects was\u2014would, on being exposed to certain degrees of impregnation by such gases, and under the conditions before adverted to, become laterized. This opinion was abundantly confirmed by later observations, but these also proved that iron alone was capable of producing rocks of a lateritic form. The result therefore was that, although proper laterite is produced in the mode which I have mentioned, yet that mode is not essential to the formation of a lateritic structure. The only essential thing is the diffusion of iron in ramifications throughout a clayey rock. Get the iron so diffused, and it is of little consequence by what door it was introduced. The only distinctive quality of proper laterite is that it has not merely got the iron, but has been in various degrees baked in the process of impregnation, and close examination can always discover traces of this. On the other hand, iron may be introduced by aqueous saturation, and if the soft rocks so saturated have planes of inferior cohesion, as many rocks have, the iron will there accumulate. If the iron solution pervade a homogeneous clayey rock as water does a sponge, the segregating or concretionary quality of iron so diffused may gradually draw it into connected nodules or ramifications; and indeed it is probable that in all cases of volcanic gaseous impregnation of the compact parts of rocks the ferruginous matter remained for a time diffused throughout the rock, and that this segregating tendency subsequently superinduced its contraction into ramifications and blotches. Where the gaseous impregnation was weak, it would speedily draw into isolated blotches; where stronger, into isolated concretions; where strongest, and the heat not too great, into\nramifications. Again, the iron may be laid up in the heart of a crystalline rock solidified from a plutonic fluid holding iron, and the essential condition for the production of the laterite structure may be found in decomposed hornblende or even black micaeous granites that have not been subjected to any supervening volcanic action. The oxidation of iron solutions in clays on exposure to the air, and the combustion of rocks by heated ferruginous gas, are chemically related, and the product of these two processes, geologically so widely sundered, is sometimes difficultly distinguishable by the eye. Ancient conglomeritic and brecciated laterites and ferruginous rocks appear to have been formed in many localities at or soon after the period of the ferruginous emissions by fragments or pebbles settling down in a sandy or clayey base saturated with ferruginous water. Similar conglomerates, breccias, and sandstones are at present forming along the coasts where the hills or banks above contain much iron; but all these are very obviously distinguishable from the original plutonically laterized sedimentary rocks.\n\nWhen I visited Malacca about two years ago I had paid very little attention to these subjects, and had not formed the preceding views. When an opportunity occurred at the beginning of last month of revisiting the place, I eagerly seized the occasion of testing these views in a new locality, and one which had been described by geologists, such as Captain Newbold and Dr. Ward, familiar with the much-vexed laterites of Southern India. Captain Newbold, in his work on the Straits, describes the Malacca hills \"as being generally of granite, with the exception of a few near the sea-coast, which are of laterite overlying the granite. Specimens of hornblende rock have been brought to me, he continues, from a hill a little south of Malacca; the islets on the coasts are of granite of various kinds, with white, red, and green felspar. In all, the felspar appears to be predominant, and mica deficient.\" Dr. Ward says of the Malacca laterite: \"In all its properties it agrees exactly with the rock common on the Malabar coast, and described by Dr. Buchanan under the name of laterite.\" I was now therefore, for the first time, in a position to bring my theory to the strongest test, for I had not seen any specimen of Indian laterite, and could only compare some of the apparently analogous Singapore rocks with it from descriptions. Captain Newbold, in one of the latest of his numerous papers on the geology of Southern India, describes very minutely the often-mentioned laterite of Beder, and makes some remarks on the long-debated question of origin. He combats the idea that it is a contemporaneous rock associating with trap, or a product, like trap, of igneous fusion. He also casts doubt on the theory advocated by several geologists, of the laterite being \"nothing more than the result of the recent disintegration of the granitic and trappean rocks\nin situ,\" and, without giving a decided opinion, says: \"The beds of lignite discovered by General Cullan and myself in the laterite of Malabar and Travancore, and the deposits of petrified wood in the Red Hills of Pondichery, in a rock which, though differing in structure, I consider as identical in age with the laterite, and other facts too long for enumeration here, points rather to its detrital origin like sandstone.\"* (\"Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,\" vol. xiii. p. 995, 1844.) Mr. Darwin, I may mention in passing, seems to lean to a similar opinion with respect to analogous rocks noticed by him. \"The origin of these superficial beds,\" he says, \"though sufficiently obscure, seems to be due to alluvial action on detritus abounding with iron.\" (\"Volcanic Islands,\" p. 143.)\n\nThe first lateritic locality which I visited on my arrival here was the island of Pulo Upa, from which much laterite has been removed for building purposes, and where it continues to be cut. The first fragment which I knocked off the rock at once satisfied me that my theory was correct. It was a rock totally different in its original character from any which I have found at the southern extremity of the peninsula, but which, by the same agency that altered the ordinary sedimentary rocks there, had been transformed from a common argillo-micaceous schist into a rock undistinguishable, save on minute inspection, and, where the alteration has been great, absolutely undistinguishable from some of the altered sedimentary shales and clays of Singapore. Upon careful examination I found, as I expected, in the sections afforded by the coast of this little islet, the original unaltered micaceous rock with great bands or dykes, and overlying masses, exhibiting abundant varieties of transformation from a rock slightly discoloured by the ferruginous action through several lateritic types, to the calcined slaggy form in which the original composition and structure are wholly obliterated. I cannot enter into further particulars. My subsequent examination of about fifty miles of the coast from Pulo Arang Arang (P. Arram), southward, and of a portion of the interior of Malacca, has proved that the whole of this region has been originally composed in a great measure of the same argillo-micaceous schist. I shall hereafter give its mineralogical characters, for I have not time nor means at present to ascertain them carefully. It is soft and glistening like silk, and leaves a powder on the fingers which exactly resembles in appearance the fine glistening powdery down from a butterfly's wing. In some cases it is less dry and more argillaceous. With the exception of Cape Rachado\u2020 it has almost everywhere been more\n\n* I have read all Captain Newbold's papers with the attention which they deserve, and I think every fact which he notices in his notes on laterite tracts is reconcilable with the theory which I maintain.\n\n\u2020 Where the plutonic action has been of a silicifying more than a ferruginating nature.\nor less penetrated in bands (and broad spaces occasionally) by ferruginous gas, which has transformed it into one or other of the forms before described, or some intermediate forms. Dykes and veins of pure quartz and of quartz with numerous fissures filled with an iron crust are frequent in some localities, while in others they are wanting. Wherever these dykes and veins occur the foliation of the schist is much contorted. In some localities the surface is covered with black shining mamillated scoriaceous blocks passing down into a lateritic mass, in which the schist is often not greatly altered, but is penetrated by ramifying dykes and veins of a ferruginous, quartzose, or quartzo-ferruginous character. Isolated pseudo-crystals and isolated plates of quartz occur in the schist in some places, and, on the other hand, patches of the schist are found in the hearts of large pieces of quartz. But it would require other twenty pages to give even an outline of the varied and irregular manner in which the rock has been altered. If we did not everywhere come upon portions of the original rock unaltered, or find traces of it in the altered tracts, it would be almost impossible to believe that all the varieties of the latter have had a common origin. I must briefly allude to Cape Rachado. This is a bolder and higher range than any found elsewhere along the coast, and projects far into the Straits. It is the only locality which I have yet seen where the quartzose has predominated over the ferruginous action of the plutonic gases. The rock everywhere exhibits unequivocal evidence of its having been originally the same argillo-micaceous schist which prevails over the rest of the region. In some places the cliffs are almost wholly quartzose; in others the rock is a congeries of quartz veins and foli\u00e6; in others the seams between the quartz foli\u00e6 have a coating of the original mica; in others the original mica predominates, and the quartz is more sparingly scattered through it. Broad dykes of compact quartz, of quartz mixed with a ferruginous crust, of numerous parallel veins with quartz crystals springing from their sides, and the interstices filled with a black ferruginous substance, sometimes dull and sometimes shining (apparently hydrated oxide of iron), and of quartz holding a similar substance in seams also occur. One of the largest and boldest cliffs has been converted into a compact siliceous rock pervaded by numerous quartzose and ferruginous dykes and veins. In some places a complete network of fissures ramifies through the rock, and it is evident that quartzo-ferruginous gas or vapour has been injected through these fissures and the large veins and dykes, and metamorphosed the rock.\n\nAt the Water Islands south of Malacca, and at Tanjong Panchur and Budewa to the north, I carefully examined some large developments of granitic rocks. In the former I found some dykes composed of quartz felspar and a ferruginous sub-\nstance similar to that already noticed. In decomposed felspar, and also in solid quartz in those dykes I found much both of decomposed and of undecomposed iron pyrites. Although these dykes seem to countenance the idea that the plutonic agency which has so greatly affected the superior rocks was exerted after the formation of the upper granite, I have from all my observations come to a different conclusion. I cannot now state its grounds, and I do not positively bind myself to an opinion which perhaps I cannot demonstrate beyond doubt to be correct; but the result of my constant consideration of the subject in all its relations, and with reference to every new locality that I have explored, is as follows:\u2014The whole region has been subjected to plutonic reduction. The plutonic fluid by its pressure has caused fractures in N.W.-S.E. lines, and it has swollen up in ramifying bands having that general direction. Its pressure and heat have varied at different portions of its surface. In some places the heat has been so intense as to reduce all the superincumbent rock up to the very surface into its own substance, and it has swollen up into mountains in the interior and hills in the exterior lateritic tracts of the peninsula.*\n\nThe transformed and partially transformed sedimentary hill ranges rest, I conceive, upon granite bubbles\u2020 where the plutonic action has been less intense. The fissures and cracks formed by the pressure of these bubbles have been the channels, the gases given off from their surface the immediate agents, of all the alterations. The tracts where only granite now appears swelling above the surface had previously passed through the same stages. In other words, laterite is one of the earliest stages in the reduction\n\n* This is opposed to prevalent theory, and it may be asked whether in that case it would not have flowed over? But I have found it impossible to apply the prevalent plutonic theory\u2014I mean that of a necessarily Tartarean origin of granite, &c.\u2014to the granites of the south of the peninsula, considered even per se, and I would ask in return whether there is any proof or probability that granite prior to solidification ever exists in the upper crust of the globe in any other form than as a viscid cohesive mass. I believe that granitic bubbles always swell up with exceeding slowness, and that the centre of the bubble (if its base be of great size) may remain for centuries, or even longer, in a viscid state, while a thick solid crust of granite has formed on the sides and summit, and that the central part will still exert a slow upward and outward pressure as it solidifies, and may itself be subject to a long-continued elevatory pressure from the sea below. In other words, the summits of granitic mountains and minor masses may go on rising above the base, after the latter with the whole surface has solidified, and when the base has no further upraised movement, save what it may possess in common with the plutonic sea below. Great dislocations in the upper crust must necessarily result, but does not every plutonic mountain range bear witness to such dislocations? I must refer to my paper on Pulo 'Ubin for the facts on which these views are based.\n\n\u2020 I do not mean that each base or hill range has a corresponding protuberance on the surface of the plutonic base, but that the whole system of hills and hillocks has been produced by inequalities in that surface, and by the directions which the principal and divergent lines of fracture have taken.\nof the upper rocks superincumbent on a plutonic sea into the substance of which that sea is composed. Where the heat has been least intense the upper rocks have merely been raised; where greater, lateritic, scoriuous, and other partially altered hill ranges have been produced. A higher degree of plutonic action has produced quartzo-ferruginous ranges like that of Cape Rachado. The highest degree has transformed or reduced the whole into granite and allied crystalline rocks; from the mode in which the granites, &c., come to the surface at Singapore, we see that the whole region there has been broken up by the plutonic sea below. I can proceed no further, however, at present, and must close this rough draught of my ideas.\\(^1\\)\n\n---\n\nXXXVII.\n\nCATALOGUE OF REPTILES INHABITING THE MALAYAN PENINSULA AND ISLANDS.\n\nCollected or observed by Theodore Cantor, M.D., Bengal Medical Service.\n\n[\u201cJournal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,\u201d vol. xvi. pp. 607\u2013656, 897\u2013952, 1026\u20131078.]\n\nCHELONIA.\n\nFam.

The gular pair of shields is very short, broadly subtriangular, with the posterior margin concave, curved backwards. The second and fifth pairs are of nearly equal size, subquadangular; their external margins forming a sharp ridge. The central part of the third and fourth pairs is subrectangular, broader than long, their margins forming a sharp ridge where they join the sterno-costal processes. The latter are of nearly equal size, longer than broad; their united length being less than one half of the central part of the sternum. The sixth pair is subrhomboidal, longer than broad. The axillary and inguinal pairs are large; the former subrhomboidal or lozenge-shaped, the latter subtriangular. The head is conic, the muzzle short-pointed, the vertex irregularly wrinkled. On the temples, cheeks, and round the orbits and the lower jaw appear some large polygonal scales. The occiput, angle of the mouth, and the rounded tympanum are covered with similar minute scales. The eyes are large, prominent; the iris silvery grey, the pupil round, black. The nostrils are minute, round, horizontally pierced, close together at the apex of the muzzle. The jaws are minutely toothed; the upper has at the symphysis two larger teeth, between which fits a similar single one in the lower jaw, thus hermetically closing the mouth. The neck, the throat, and the other soft parts are studded with minute tubercles, except the fore-arm, the posterior tarsal margin, and the back of the fingers and toes, which are covered with broad but very short polygonal scales. On the ulnar margin of the fore-arm are four to five large rounded flexible scales. The interdigital web is large and lax. The nails are strong, of nearly equal size, sharp, and arched. The conical tail reaches but little beyond the shell, with a longitudinal furrow behind the vent. The head, neck, throat, and the limbs are of the same greyish-green olive as the shell. The interdigital membrane is blackish, except the web connecting the fourth and fifth (nailless) toe, which is of a bright greenish-yellow colour. Of three individuals observed, differing but little in size, the largest was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . . . 0\\(\\frac{6}{8}\\) inch.\n\" \" neck . . . . . . 0\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\)\" \"\n\" \" shell . . . . . . 2\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)\" inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . . . 0\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) inch.\nGreatest transverse diameter of the shell 2\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\)\" inches.\n\nTwo were at different times found in fishing stakes placed along the sea-shore of Pinang; a third was also taken out of the sea with a small hook baited with a shrimp. The Malays assert that this tortoise also inhabits estuaries and rivers on the peninsula,\nand that it grows to a considerable size. The young is very timid, withdrawing the head and extremities when touched, and thus it remained immovable while a sketch was taken.\n\nFrom the description of the young of *Trionyx Lessonii*, Dum. and Bibr., given in \"Erp\u00e9tologie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale,\" tome 2, p. 338, and from the plates of *Emys balasur* and *Emys baska* in \"Illustr.

In size it equals *Chelonia midas*. Schweigger, which it rivals in flavour. About December and January is the season when the female deposits her eggs in the sandy beach of some sequestered island, and then the fishermen watch during the moonlight nights to \"turn turtles.\" The eggs are of a spherical shape, about one inch in diameter, covered by a soft hemitransparent membrane of a pale yellow colour. The expert eye of the fisherman battles the pains with which the turtle conceals her eggs, and prodigious numbers are disinterred. They are very rich, flavoured like marrow, and will keep for weeks although exposed to the air.\n\nMM. Dum\u00e9ril and Bibron have pointed out the differences between the adult of the present species and *Chelonia midas*, Schweigger, principally consisting in colours, and in the form of the vertebral and costal shields, to which may be added the comparatively greater length of the fronto-nasal shields in *Chelonia virgata*, in which the breadth is one-third of the length, whereas in *Chelonia midas* it is one-half, and these proportions appear to be constant in all ages of the two species. The very young of both greatly resemble each other in colours and shape. Six living young of the present species were all of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . . . 0\\(\\frac{7}{8}\\) inch.\n,, ,, neck . . . . . . 0\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) ,,\nLength of the shell . . . . . 2 inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . . 6\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch.\n\nThe following slight differences are the result of a comparison between the living young of *Chelonia virgata* and the representation of *Chelonia midas* given by Schoepf. tab. xvii. fig. 2.\n\n**Chelonia virgata.**\n1.

The vertebral shields are still slightly keeled. The 1st and 4th pairs of costals, the 2nd left costal, and the 4th vertebral are divided. The central part of the margin is slightly curved upwards.

Although numerous at Pinang and\nthe opposite coast, it appears to be less so than *Crocodilus biporcatus*. Fishermen while working the nets are not seldom attacked by crocodiles, and would, but for their presence of mind, oftener than they do, forfeit their lives. When seized they force their fingers into the eyes of the crocodile, which immediately lets go its victim, who is farther rescued by his comrades. From 1842 to 1845 amputations from accidents of this description were unfortunately of no rare occurrence in the General Hospital at Pinang.\n\nIndividuals 15 ft. in length are not uncommon; some attaining to 20 ft. and upwards are reported to occur. In rivers a single one will often appropriate to himself a limited district, which, if it happens to be in the vicinity of a village, will soon be perceived in the loss of the grazing cattle. Instances of Malays, who, to avenge the loss of a relative, have watched the crocodile, and by diving from below plunged a *kris* into its heart, are on record. The eggs are white, the shell hard, of a cylindrical form, upwards of 3 in. in length, and about 1\u00bd in. in diameter.\n\n**Crocodilus porosus**, Schneider.\n\nSyn.\u2014Crocodili Ceylonici ex ovo prodiens, Seba.\n\nCr. biporcatus, Cuvier apud\n\nTideman, Oppel, Liboschitz.\nMerren.\nBory de St. Vincent.\nFitzinger.\nLesson.\nGu\u00e9rin.\nWagler.\nGray.\nHorsfield, l.c.\n\nCrocodilus biporcatus raninus, M\u00fcller, tab. 3, fig. 8.\nCrocodilus porosus, Schn. apud Gray: Catal.\n\"Bu\u00e1ya\" of the Malays.\n\nUpper jaw surmounted by two rugged ridges, each commencing from the anterior angle of the eye; nuchal plates, either none or two very small.

The anus is covered by a transversal fold, reaching across from the one thigh to the other. There are no femoral pores. The tail is tapering, much depressed, convex on the upper surface, flat beneath, sharp at the sides. Near the root, about \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of an inch distant from the anus, the skin forms an annular fold, completely encircling that part of the tail. The colour slightly differs from that of the Otaheite individuals. The upper parts and the lower surface of the tail from the annular fold are of a buff or pale dust colour, so closely and minutely dotted with reddish-brown that the parts have a pale greyish-brown appearance. On the loins and between the shoulders are a few distant blackish spots; besides, in the latter place, appear two short lateral lines, and an indistinct band proceeds from the nostril across the eye to the shoulder. The throat, inner side of the limbs, abdomen, and the lower surface of the root of the tail to the annular fold are buff-coloured.

Above, the nostrils are surrounded by two smaller irregular triangular, and behind by a narrow crescent-shaped scale. Of labial scales there are fourteen above, twelve below. There are about seventy-two teeth in each jaw. The eye is very large; pupil, black, dentilated; iris, silvery bluish-grey. The ear is very large, obliquely oval, without dentilations. The cheeks are much swollen. The scales of the back are small, rounded, hexagonal, becoming more rectangular on the sides. The rows of lenticular scales along the vertebrae are smaller than the rest, but not so close as in *P. guttatus*. Behind the mental scale is a pair of large elongated scales, and five pentagonal larger appear on each side behind the lower labials. The gular scales are small, polygonal; the abdominal are rounded, hexagonal, not imbricate, and below the root of the tail become somewhat larger. The rest of the lower surface of the tail is covered with scutella. Above, the covering of the tail is like that of *P. guttatus*. On each side of the posterior margin of the cloaca are two very large tubercular scales, and towards the centre two rather large post-anal pores, covered by a loose fold of the skin. Fourteen femoral pores are placed on a slightly angular line. This species is also closely allied to *Platydactylus monarchus*, Schlegel, from which it, however, readily may be distinguished by the regular rows of lenticular dorsal scales, by its far greater size, and by its loud note. It is not numerous at Pinang. The only individual obtained, from the villa on the Pentland Hills, was a male of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . . . 2\\(\\frac{2}{8}\\) inches.\n\" trunk . . . . . . 5\\(\\frac{4}{8}\\)\" \"\n\" tail . . . . . . 8\\(\\frac{2}{8}\\)\" \"\nEntire length . . . . . . 16\" \"\n\n*Platydactylus monarchus*, Schlegel, MS.\n\nSyn.\u2014Platydactylus monarchus, Schl. apud Dum. and Bibr.\nGecko monarchus, Gray: Catal.\n\nOn the back, sides, and limbs numerous conical tubercles irregularly scattered among the smaller flat polygonal scales: on the\nupper surface of the tail six to thirteen transversal series of small spines; beneath scutella, sometimes mixed with scuta.

Beneath, yellowish-white.\n\nHab.\u2014Malayan Peninsula, Pinang, Singapore.\nPhilippine Islands, Amboyna, Borneo.\n\nThe Malayan Geckonidae have the power of somewhat changing the ground colour; none, however, in a greater degree than the present species. In the valley and on the hills of Pinang it is very numerous, swarming at night in rooms, on the walls, and under the ceiling, occasionally giving out a sound resembling the monosyllable \"Tok,\" repeated six or eight times with increased celerity. The aim of these lizards is by no means unerring; they frequently miss an insect, and fall from the ceiling. Among themselves they are pugnacious; when two or more covet an insect, the successful one has to defend its prize, or give it up to the stronger. The new-born (with umbilical aperture) and adult are of the following dimensions:\n\n|                  | New-born | Adult |\n|------------------|----------|-------|\n| Length of the head | 0 3/8    | 1 2/5 inches |\n| \" trunk          | 0 5/8    | 2 2/5 \"   |\n| \" tail           | 1 1/8    | 3 1/2 \"   |\n| Entire length    | 2 1/8    | 6 5/8 \"   |\n\nSub-Gen.

Between the eyes and muzzle a double figure, in whitish outline, representing in front a broad arrowhead, posteriorly united by a narrow stalk to a rectangular transversal band, situated in front of the eyes. On the vertex another, larger figure, traced in whitish outline, rectangular in front, spreading like a four-rayed star over the occiput. A dark brown band proceeds from behind the eye, across the ear, to the shoulders, where it is lost in the general dark brown colour of the sides of the body. The superior margins of these two lateral bands are white, proceeding backwards in zig-zag line, approaching each other over the shoulders, where they join the anterior black transversal line. The lips white. The membranes of the cheeks pale flesh-colour, with dark blue spots, and with the interstices between the scales pale lilac. The pupil vertical, dentilated; the iris rich golden brown.\n\nBack.\u2014Of the same ground colour as the head, becoming dark reddish-brown on the sides, relieved by four to six distant transversal black dotted lines, on the upper part, of the form of the letter M, sending oblique, forwards pointed, lines on the sides. The upper part of the lateral membrane reddish-brown; the interstices of the small rectangular scales purple.\n\nTail and limbs.\u2014Same ground-colour as that of the head and back, with broad, distant, indistinctly whitish, transversal bands. On each elbow a whitish ring. Membranes of the tail, limbs, and toes are yellowish-grey, with numerous minute spots of brown, purple, blue, and red, which impart a purple, changing appearance to the general colour. The number of the indentations of the caudal membranes varies individually; the posterior part is entire, with waving surfaces.\n\nLower parts.\u2014Brownish-white, with a few pale brown spots on the throat, inner side of the limbs, in the palms and soles. The tail and its membranes brownish.\n\nHab.\u2014Pinang Hills.\nSingapore, Java, Ramree Island (Arracan).\n\nAs correctly observed by MM. Dum\u00e9ril and Bibron, the scales of the female, corresponding to those with the femoral pores of the male, have a slight yet distinct central depression. The female has a large tubercular scale on each side of the root of the tail, as well as the male. In colour and size the two sexes resemble each other. Two individuals were at different times captured in the villa occupied by Sir William Norris on the Great Hill of Pinang. When the lizard is at rest, the membranes of the cheeks and the body are kept in close contact with these parts; in leap-\ning, those of the body are somewhat stretched out, and all the membranes together then act as a parachute. Also, this lizard has in some degree the power of changing the ground colour from a darker to a lighter shade. The apex of the tongue is rounded, with a small notch in the centre. A female while in my possession refused insects and water. She deposited a single egg, of a spherical form, about half an inch in diameter, soft, and of a yellowish-white colour, which the following day she devoured. A male ate the integuments he had been changing. The female was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . . . 1 inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . . . 2\\(\\frac{6}{8}\\) inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . . . 3\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) \"\nEntire length . . . . . . 7\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) \"\n\nIn the Museum of the Asiatic Society is preserved a specimen of *Leptophis ornatus* (Merrem) in the act of devouring one of the present species.

In a male the posterior half of the tail happens to be divided so as to appear double; one of the pieces, the continuation of the normal tail, is depressed, slightly fringed, and beneath with the row of scuta continued, the other is cylindrical, somewhat shorter, and above and below covered with minute scales.

Chin with six scales, the centre pair elongated pentagonal. Males with thirty-six femoral pores on two not connected lines, between which, in front of the anus, a short, narrow, longitudinal furrow. Both sexes with three or four tubercles obliquely situated on each side of the root of the tail.\n\nYoung and Adult.\u2014Above a rich brownish ochre; the nape of the neck and back with six broad transversal bands (the two anterior horse-shoe shaped), of a rich velvety mulberry, or snuff-colour with sulphur or chrome-yellow margins. The tail with eight or nine complete rings of similar colour, without the margins. Beneath, throat and belly whitish-yellow, or pale brownish, each scale minutely dotted with brown. Pupil vertical, dentilated; iris golden, finely vermiculated with Vandyke brown.\n\nHab.\u2014Pinang Hills.\nSingapore.\n\nIn the male the two rows of femoral pores commence as two short, parallel, longitudinal lines, separated from each other by a narrow, short furrow, on the sides of which (vertically) the first five femoral (preanal) pores are placed. In front of the anus the short vertical portions turn right and left under a nearly right angle, continuing the entire length of the thigh, each supporting thirteen more femoral pores. The interval between the anus and the latter is partly occupied by a flat, slightly raised, triangular space, covered by rather large imbricate rounded scales. In the female the two lines of larger scales carrying the femoral pores of the males are present, each scale having a small, shallow, round\ndepression. The short, longitudinal furrow of the male is either wanting or barely distinguishable; but the triangular space with larger scales, in front of the anus, is present. The species appears to be rather numerous on the hills at Pinang, where the individuals obtained were captured in houses at an elevation of 2,200 feet. The largest male was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . . . 1\\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) inches.\n\" \" trunk . . . . . . 3 \"\n\" \" tail . . . . . . 5\\(\\frac{4}{5}\\)\"\nEntire length . . . . . . 10 \"\n\nIts habits offer nothing peculiar; it bites fiercely in defence. In captivity it refuses insects. The integuments, when about being renewed, are piecemeal torn off by the teeth and devoured. A single egg deposited was of a spherical form, about half an inch in diameter, of a whitish-yellow colour. MM. Dum\u00e9ril and Bibron assign Bengal as the habitat of this species. The specimen originally described by Mr. Gray, some in the Museum of the Asiatic Society, and a number in my own collection, are all from the hills of Prince of Wales Island (Pulo Pinang), but no authenticated record exists of this species ever having been observed in Bengal. Another, widely different, species of *Gymnodactylus* inhabits Bengal, as yet not published, and only known from three specimens, preserved in spirits, in the Museum of the Asiatic Society, where they are marked *Gymnodactylus lunatus*, Blyth. One of these came from Midnapore, the others from Chyebassa. The species somewhat approaches to *G. fasciatus*, Dum. and Bibr. (*Cubina fasciata*, Gray). The Museum possesses another nondescript species from Almorah, *Gymnodactylus nebulosus*, Blyth MSS., allied to *G. marmoratus*, Gray.\n\nThe plate of *Cyrtodactylus pulchellus* in Gray's illustrations of Indian zoology is not taken from life, and gives a most inadequate idea of the physiognomy and beauty of the living animal. This should be observed, as MM. Dum\u00e9ril and Bibron praise the figure, which evidently has served as the original of their own description, and of copies introduced in illustrative works upon that order of animals.\n\n**Fam.

It is commonly during the day observed in the branches of trees overhanging rivers, preying upon birds and their eggs, and smaller lizards, and when disturbed it throws itself from a considerable height into the water. When attacked on level ground it attempts its escape by running, if possible towards the water. Its quickness, however, is not so great as to prevent a man from overtaking it, when it will courageously defend itself with teeth and claws and by strokes of the tail. The lowest castes of Hindoos capture these lizards commonly by digging them out of their burrows on the banks of rivers for the sake of their flesh, which by these people is greatly relished. Some individuals attain to nearly seven feet in length, but the majority are smaller.

It moves and leaps with great quickness among the branches of trees. The most striking feature is the great power of suddenly changing its colours. The Malayan denomination of this species is \"Gruning,\" which in Marsden's Dictionary is translated \"a species of lizard which changes its colour as it is affected by fear or anger; the chameleon.\" No chameleon, however, appears to inhabit the Malayan countries, but the present lizard passes under that name among the European inhabitants.

They were very active and fierce, possessed in a slight degree the power of changing the ground-colour to a lighter hue, and in captivity refused food and water. In a female were found thirteen eggs of a yellowish-white colour, of an oval shape, \\( \\frac{6}{8} \\) inch in length. The stomach contained fragments of leaves and twigs, and a quantity of earth and lime. The latter probably originated from the lime-water with which the spice-trees are copiously sprinkled, to secure them against the attacks of insects.

The muzzle is narrow, rounded, depressed. The upper surface of the head is very sloping, with a narrow furrow between the arched orbital parietes; the forehead depressed or concave. The scales are polygonal, keeled; those of the margin of the orbits and forehead larger, imbricate, forming a sharp ridge; four similar scales form a short ridge in the centre of the forehead, close to the muzzle. Behind the orbit, over tympanum, and on each side of the nape of the neck, are similar short, oblique ridges, each composed of five larger pointed tubercular scales. The rostral shield is very broad, narrow, triangular; the mental is much smaller, pointed, triangular, with two large polygonal scales on each side. The upper jaw is covered with twenty-six, the lower with twenty-four elongated, narrow, rectangular scales. **Dentition:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Incis. } \\frac{6}{4}; \\quad \\text{Canin. } \\frac{1-1}{1-1}; \\quad \\text{Mol. } \\frac{14.14}{14.14} = \\frac{36}{34}\n\\]\n\nThe incisors and anterior molars are very small; the latter gradually increasing in size, flat, sharply edged, bluntly tricuspidate. The tongue is thick, flattened, very slightly notched in front, the anterior half spongy, the posterior with large backward-pointed papillae. The nostrils are nearly circular, pierced in a large oval scale, in front of which three scales intervene between the rostral. The eyes are large, sunk in the orbits; the pupil circular, black; the iris blue, with golden spots and a narrow ring. The eyelids are covered with very minute polygonal tubercular scales. Each tarsus with a double row of scales, the inner one of small, polygonal, tubercular; the outer one of rhombic, flat, with the angles overlapping, so as to give the free margin a toothed\nappearance. The tympanum is large circular. The skin of the throat is very lax, forming a compressed pouch, the anterior margin of which is slightly toothed, owing to the series of scales overlapping each other. But there is during life no trace of any \"cross fold behind, extending up the front of the shoulders. The scales of the neck and back are very minute, rhombic, or sub-rectangular, smooth, increasing in size, and becoming imbricate on the sides, abdomen, limbs, and throat. On the neck is a high-arched, toothed crest, composed of twenty-six large ensiform scales, the thirteen anterior gradually increasing in length, the rest decreasing. The base of the crest is supported by two parallel, slightly arched series of rectangular scales, much larger than those of the rest of the body, but those of the upper series double the size of those of the inferior. The dorsal crest commences at a short interval a little behind the shoulders. In shape and component parts it resembles the former, but is double the extent, consisting of forty-five scales, all of which, however, are inferior in height to those of the cervical crest, which, as well as the somewhat lower, sloping level, renders the dorsal crest less conspicuous than the former. The skin is somewhat lax on the sides of the body, leaving the ribs visible. The tail is very much compressed, attenuated, elongated. Its sides are covered with rather large, smooth, imbricate, rhombic scales. The anterior third of the upper margin is toothed, composed of a single row of large, gradually decreasing, sharply keeled scales. The other two-thirds are covered by two rows of keeled scales, thus giving the posterior part of the tail a bidentated appearance. The lower surface of the tail is covered by two series of large, gradually decreasing, imbricate, keeled scales, giving it a bidentated appearance. The limbs are slender; the anterior little more than half the length of the posterior, and the toes very short. The posterior fourth toe is excessively long. The palms and soles are covered with minute, pointed, rough scales; the toes above and beneath with sharply keeled, imbricate, rhombic scales. The claws are large, trenchant, curved.\n\nColours.\u2014The ground-colour of the head, neck, throat, gular pouch, and the chest is impure gamboge, the scales edged with brown; the eyelids dark brown, the tarsi buff. A dark blue triangular streak proceeds from the anterior angle of the orbit to the nostril; another is placed parallel with the upper labial scales, which, as well as the lower, are of a pale blue, as also the tympanum. From the labial scales and tympanum on each side across the throat, the pouch, and the sides of the neck, proceed seven oblique, undulating, dark blue bands. The tympanum is enclosed by two oblique, broad, purple-brown bands, which join each other under an angle at the anterior extremity of the cervical crest, where a third broad, longitudinal, purple-brown band commences, pro-\nceeding over the side of the neck, then expanding, covers the back and the upper half of the sides of the body, where its lower margin describes two large curves. The lower part of the sides are of a deep lilac, changing on the abdomen to bluish-white. On the sides of the body and on the abdomen appear several oblique series of lozenge-shaped spots: a few on the brown portion of the sides of a deep Indian red, the rest bright gamboge. The cervical and dorsal crests are mulberry-brown; the former with the upper half of each of the first thirteen scales light green; the latter with the upper half of the first ten scales pale yellow. The scales at the base of the crest partake of the general colour, but many of them have a pale yellow spot. The tail is coloured above and beneath with alternate broad rings of impure white, the scales edged with brown and purple-brown, changing to black on the posterior half. The legs, feet, and toes are dark purple-brown with indistinct transversal yellowish bands.

It appeared slow in its movements, of general sluggish habits, showed no power of changing colours, and in confinement it refused insects, vegetable food, as well as water. After having been preserved in rectified spirits of wine for upwards of three years, the specimen has retained the original brown and white colours and the Indian red spot; but the yellow, light green, and light blue have changed to whitish, and the dark blue marks to blackish. Although the colours in this state do not agree with those given by Mr. Gray, apparently, though not stated, taken from a preserved specimen, the peculiar distribution of the markings correspond, and induce me to believe in the identity of the animals.\n\nGen.

Such as are current of this and other species appear to have been taken from preserved specimens. As the lizard lies in the shade along the trunk of a tree, its colours, at a distance, appear like a mixture of brown and grey, and render it scarcely distinguishable from the bark. Thus it remains, with no signs of life except the restless eyes, watching passing insects, which, suddenly expanding the wings, it seizes with a sometimes considerable, unerring leap. It is but on close inspection, exposed to the light or in the sun, that the matchless brilliancy of its colours is visible. But the lizard itself appears to possess no power of changing them. This species is numerous on trees, in valleys and hills. The female, apparently less numerous than the male, carries three to four eggs of an oval cylindrical shape, \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) of an inch in length, and of a yellowish-white colour. Of a number examined none exceeded the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . . . \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . . . \\( \\frac{2}{8} \\) inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . . . \\( \\frac{4}{8} \\) \"\n\\( \\frac{7}{8} \\) \"\n\nB.

The adult male carries a very elongated,\n\n* \"Grey, black-spotted; wings black-spotted; throat grey; pouch of the male elongate; scales of the back rather unequal, rhombic, keeled; of the sides rather smaller; sides with a series of large-keeled scales; ears rather sunk, with unequal flat scales; tail slender, with a central keel above, and five more small ones on the sides, base dilated, with five nearly equidistant equal keels above.\u2014Catalogue of the Specimens of Lizards, &c., p. 236.\"\npointed gular pouch, double the length of the head, and a slightly elevated cervical crest, consisting of six to eight pointed tubercular scales, and continued along the anterior half of the back in the shape of a ridge composed of a raised fold of the skin. The female has neither cervical crest nor dorsal ridge, and her gular pouch is much reduced, its length being about one-half of the length of the head. Both sexes have the following characters in common:\u2014From each side of the neck commences a series of spinous scales, sometimes close together on one side, distant on the other, which, increasing in size and becoming more distant, continue along the side of the body, where they deviate outwards, marking the origin of the wings, and again converge towards the root of the tail, where they terminate. The scales of the back are generally smooth, consisting of smaller polygonal, mixed with some larger rhombic, indistinctly keeled, imbricate scales. In some individuals the latter are disposed so as to form a series on each side of the dorsal spine. The supraorbital margin has from three to four large pointed tubercles, of which but the one situated at the posterior angle appears to be constant. The scales of the neck and throat are small granular, from which those covering the tympanum differ by being larger, flattened, and polygonal. The tubercles of the throat and neck, and many of the scales of the back, wing membranes, and the limbs, have each a minute rounded cavity at the point, discernible by a lens. The pouches, chest and abdomen are covered with rhombic, imbricate, keeled scales without apical cavities. Each jaw has sixteen labial scales. The tail is long, very broad at the base, particularly in the male, suddenly tapering, rounded above, and covered with strongly keeled, imbricate, rhombic scales. The first large ones of the lowest series of the root form a more or less conspicuous toothed crest. The lower surface is flattened, with scales like the upper. The apex of the tongue is notched.

The upper parts of the body are metallic greenish-brown, varied with golden rose-colour or isabella, indistinctly dotted and lined with black. The wings are golden isabella with transversal black bands, formed by series of black rounded spots, either separate or confluent on the inner half, but blending into one another on the outer half. In some individuals numerous undulating golden rose-coloured or buff lines longitudinally intersect the bands. The margins are finely fringed with silver. The limbs and tail are indistinctly ringed with black or brown. A black spot on the vertex, between the eyes, appears to be constant also in this\nspecies. The gular pouch and the throat are bright yellow, the latter in some dotted with pale brown. The chest and abdomen whitish-yellow in some, bluish-white in others. The under surface of the wings is of the latter colour, in some with single large rounded black spots near the margins, independent of the upper markings; which may be distinguished through the hemitransparent membrane.\n\nOf this species but four, of which two males were received from Sir Wm. Norris. They were all from the Hills of Pinang;* none exceeded the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . . . 0\u00bd inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . . . 3 inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . . . 5\u00bd \"\n8\u00be \"\n\nThe intestinal canal of a female measured:\n\nSmall intestines . . . . . . 3 inches.\nLarge \" . . . . . . 0\u00be \"\nC\u00e6cum \" . . . . . . 0\u00bd \"\n\nThe capacious stomach contained remains of insects, particularly of the gigantic black ant, inhabiting the Malayan hill forests. The first portion of duodenum is much widened till within a quarter of an inch from pylorus, where ductus coledochus enters. C\u00e6cum is of a short crescent shape, much widened, as well as the large intestine. In the abdominal cavity appeared five eggs, of an oval form, yellowish-white colour, each half an inch in length.\n\nGen.

The fore-legs with orange-coloured rounded spots, some of which tipped with azure; the hind-legs minutely spotted with yellow. The throat pale azure; abdomen pale orange marble with broad bluish-black veins; the tail beneath pale yellowish-white. The lower eyelid is pure white; pupil circular, iris hazel with a narrow golden ring.\n\nHab.\u2014Malayan Peninsula, Pinang.\nCochin-China.\n\nThe head is covered with small elongated polygonal keeled scales; the upper jaw with twenty-six, the lower with eighteen to twenty. The mental shield is elongated, polygonal; the upper part of the sides is joined to the first lower labial scale; the centre part is on each side in contact with the first series of thirteen to fifteen elongated polygonal scales, which follow the track of the labial, between which there is a narrow intervening space covered with smooth polygonal scales, larger than those of the rest of the throat. The back and wing membranes are covered with minute granular scales; the abdomen with larger smooth rhombic scales. Those of the tail, above and beneath, are verticillated, rectangular, sub-imbricate, and strongly keeled. The tongue is thick, fungous, not scaly, as incorrectly represented, with the tip much flattened, free and slightly extensible, divided in two laterally compressed sharp points. The molar teeth are tricuspidate, increasing in size, the anterior being the smallest. In the adult they are much worn and incrustated with brown tartar, like the teeth of Semnopitheci and Ruminantia.\n\nDentition:\n\n* In the supposition that this incorrectly drawn and coloured figure has been taken from the living animal, MM. Dum\u00e9ril and Bibron have been led to publish an erroneous description and figure. The last description of this species of Mr. Gray appears to be founded on the same authority. It runs thus: \"Olive with black-edged white spots, and a black-edged white streak on each side; beneath, whitish.\"\u2014Catal. &c., p. 263.\nIncis. $\\frac{4}{1-1}$; Canin. $\\frac{1}{1-1}$; Mol. $\\frac{12.12}{11.11}$\n\nThe nails are long, slightly arched, of a pale yellowish horn-colour.\n\nThe wing membrane in a state of repose appears like a longitudinal loose fold, extending along each side from the axilla to the inguinal region. Expanded, the external margin becomes arched, the trunk and the membranes forming a greatly flattened oval disk (strongly contrasting with the bulky appearance of the parts in a state of repose), resembling the hood of *Naja*. The transversal diameter of the disk across axilla and the inguinal region is $1\\frac{1}{8}$ inch; across the centre $2\\frac{3}{8}$ inches. Like the mechanism of the genus *Draco*, the membranes are expanded by means of the very long six anterior pairs of spurious ribs, which the lizard has the power of moving forward under a right angle with the vertebral column. The six posterior ones are excessively short, and, though equally movable, do not appear materially to assist in expanding the membranes. The latter are used as a parachute in leaping from branch to branch, after which they immediately resume their state of repose. Sudden fear or anger will also cause a momentary expansion. The femoral pores are situated on a series of rather large rhombic scales on each thigh. In a number of twelve adult individuals, the pores varied from thirteen to nineteen on each thigh. In the specimens in the Paris Museum, described by MM. Dum\u00e9ril and Bibron, there are from twenty to twenty-four on each thigh.\n\nThis species appears to be numerous, but local. Twelve were at one time obtained from a spice plantation in province Wellesley, some of which were in the act of changing the integuments. They were very active and swift, more so than their rather heavy make would induce one to believe, and they would bite and scratch when handled, although among themselves in a spacious cage they appeared peaceable, and patiently submitted to being trodden or run over by a neighbour, about ascending the perch. The Malay who brought the lizards asserted they were frugivorous, and might be fed with soft fruit and boiled rice, which was perfectly true. In one immediately examined, the stomach and intestines contained rounded seeds of various kinds, from the smallest size to that of a large pea, and vegetable fibres.*\n\nThe rest refused insects and different kinds of fruit, but during the several months' confinement each would daily eat a little boiled rice, and occasionally take water. Of these none exceeded the following dimensions:\n\n* The latter, however, as well as sand and fragments of stone, also occur in carnivorous and insectivorous lizards, as well as serpents, which swallow these substances to stimulate digestion.\nLength of the head . . . . o foot $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inches.\n\" \" trunk . . . . o \" $4\\frac{2}{3}$ \"\n\" \" tail . . . . i \" o \"\n\nEntire length . . . . i \" $5\\frac{3}{8}$ \"\n\nLength of the intestinal canal:\nSmall intestines . . . . . . . . 5$\\frac{6}{8}$ inches.\nLarge \" . . . . . . . . 3 \"\nC\u00e6cum \" . . . . . . . . 0$\\frac{2}{8}$ \"\n\nThe stomach is of a lengthened pyriform shape, one inch in length; duodenum, narrow, receives ductus coleductus at $\\frac{3}{8}$ in. distance from pylorus. C\u00e6cum is very short, nearly circular. The large intestine is sacculated, terminating in a short simple rectum.\n\nThere seems to be reason to believe that *Leiolepis revesii* Gray, inhabiting \"China\" and Arracan, is also found on the Malayan Peninsula.\n\nFam.

Such was the only account of this species at the time of the publication of \"Erp\u00e9tologie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale,\" where it is not introduced. Mr. Gray's latest description runs thus: \"Olive with longitudinal series of pale whitish spots; when alive, blackish, with orange spots on the back, and a series of bright red spots on the sides. China.\" (\"Catalogue,\" &c., p. 263.)\n\nThe Museum of the Asiatic Society possesses an adult male and a young specimen sent from Arracan by Capt. Phayre. The form resembles in every particular that of *Leiolepis guttatus*, from which the present species principally differs by its colours, larger, heavier make and size. Each jaw is covered by twenty scales. From the mental scale proceeds a series of ten larger scales on each side below the labial. On the throat appear two or three strong transversal folds, of which the anterior commences from the posterior margin of the tympanum. The tail is covered with keeled verticillate scales, as in *L. guttatus*, but not with \"rings of smooth scales,\" as Mr. Gray's generic character states.

They may be seen basking in the sun in bamboo hedges or on trees, and they fearlessly enter houses in pursuit of insects, in which they display great agility. The female deposits six to twelve yellow-white, oval cylindrical eggs, half an inch in length. Nearly all have on the lower two-thirds of the tail a series of large scuta. In one individual observed the last two-thirds of the back of the tail was covered with a single series of very broad scales, of which each of the anterior had fifteen to sixteen keels.

They mostly live under ground, but appear occasionally in shady places, particularly after showers of rain, in Bengal, in the rainy season. They are very agile, and appear to make use of the horny point of the tail as a propeller. When taken, they frequently press it against the hand in their attempts to escape. Reposing on the ground, *Typhlops braminus* may easily be mistaken for an earthworm, until its serpentine movements, the darting of the white furcated tongue, while the head and neck are raised, make it known. In confinement they refuse food and water. In all dissected, the stomach contained some earth; in a few, remains of insects (Myriapoda, ants).

The head is uniformly black, without the two scarlet frontal spots; the apex of the tail whitish; the posterior part of the body is more robust than the anterior; the length of the head forms more than $\\frac{3}{5}$ of the entire length of the animal; there are six pairs of labial shields on each jaw, and the scales of the trunk are disposed in twenty longitudinal series. It unites characters assigned by MM. Dum\u00e9ril and Bibron as distinguishing Cylindrophis rufus\nfrom *C. melanotus*, Wagler, and it would therefore appear that Dr. Schlegel is justified in considering the latter from Celebes (*Tortrix melanota*, Boie, MS.) as a variety of *rufa*. In the present individual there is no external appearance of the very rudimentary anal hooks.

The head is divided from the muzzle to the nape of the neck by a black line, continued along the back to the point of the tail, and describing a series of large lozenges, sometimes linked to each other by a small black ring, sometimes broken up into large irregular patches. A black oblique line proceeds from behind the eye towards the angle of the mouth, continuing on the sides as a series of more or less regular lozenges, which are joined to the lateral angles of those of the back by a large, black, triangular spot, with a white arched mark in the centre. The scales nearest the black margins of the lozenges are of a lighter colour than the rest, sometimes whitish. Between and within the lateral lozenges appear numerous black spots, or interrupted lines. The lips (the lower in some present a black line) and abdominal scuta are gamboge or pale yellow, as well as the lowest two or three series of scales, but the latter with irregular black spots. The caudal scutella and scuta, when present, are yellow marbled with black. The iris is silvery flesh-coloured or yellowish-brown, sometimes with a black bar; the pupil vertically contracted by the light. The tongue is black above, bluish-white beneath. In the young the colours are brighter than in the adult.\n\nScuta, 297 to 330; scutella, 82 to 102.\n\nHAB.\u2014Malayan Peninsula and Islands.\nChusan?* Amboina, Java, Banka, Sumatra, Bengal.\u2020\n\nThe two fossets of the rostral shield are pyriform, with the apex diverging, and those of the nearest three or four upper labials are of similar shape. The inferior fossets are square, occupying the lower margin of the shield, varying from seven to nine on each side. The foremost of these is situated on the shield corresponding to that of the upper jaw, which borders the orbit.\n\nThis species is very numerous in the Malayan hills and valleys,\n\n* Skins are of frequent occurrence at Chusan, and the natives assert that the serpent is found there and on the neighbouring continent. Serpents from 14 to 16 feet in length, \"rock-snakes,\" were observed by several officers during our occupation of the island.\n\n\u2020 MM. Dum\u00e9ril and Bibron state that this species has been sent from Bengal by M. A. Duvauzel. The natives are not acquainted with it, and the specimens in the Museum of the Asiatic Society are from Pinang. The living animal is occasionally brought from the Straits of Malacca to Calcutta, and such is probably the history of the specimen sent from Bengal by M. Duvauzel. Python molurus, Linn\u00e9 (Paida poda and bora of Russell), is very numerous in Bengal.\nfeeding upon quadrupeds and birds. It often takes up its abode in outhouses, preying at night, and is thus useful in destroying vermin, although plunder is occasionally committed in poultry-yards. Dr. Montgomerie has seen in Georgetown, Pinang, a young one which the inhabitants suffered to retain unmolested possession of the rice stores in order to secure them against the ravages of rats. Individuals of 16 ft. in length are of no rare occurrence. In 1844 one was killed at the foot of Pinang, which a gentleman informed me measured more than 30 ft. During the expedition to China, in 1849, one was shot from the poop of one of H.M. transports, then riding in Singapore roads, between three and four miles from the shore. It was about 9 ft. long, and had the upper part of the head infested with *Ixodes ophiophilus*, M\u00fcller.\n\nThe Chinese attribute great medicinal qualities to the heart and the gall-bladder, and use the skin to cover the bodies of some of their musical instruments. *Python molurus*, Linn\u00e9 (*Pudda peda*, Russell, i. pl. 22, 23, 24, and *bora*, pl. 39), is said also to occur, but rarely, in the Malayan Peninsula, but I never had an opportunity of seeing it.\n\n**AQUATIC.**\n\n**Gen.

These expressive vernacular names refer to the loose skin and the bulk of the animal.*\nA female captured on the Great Hill at Pinang, at a distance from water, was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . o feet 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . 4 \" 7 inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . o \" 9 \"\n5 \" 5\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) \"\n\nGreatest circumference, 1 foot.\n\nNotwithstanding the sharply compressed abdomen, the serpent moved without difficulty, but sluggishly, on the ground, and preferred quiet. When touched she attempted to bite, but the pupil being contracted by the glare, she missed her aim. Shortly after being brought, while the rest of the body remained motionless the posterior ribs were observed moving, and the serpent successively, in the course of about twenty-five minutes, brought forth twenty-seven young ones. Each birth was followed by some sanguinolent serum. With two exceptions the foetus appeared with the head foremost. They were very active, bit fiercely, and their teeth were fully developed. Shortly after birth the integuments came off in large pieces, which is also the case with the foetus of several species of *Homalopsis*. The present ones were placed in water, which, however, appeared to distress them, as they all attempted to escape on dry ground. Nearly all were of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . o foot o\\(\\frac{6}{8}\\) inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . 1 \" 1\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) \"\n\" \" tail . . . . o \" 3 inches.\n1 \" 5 \"\n\nThe Malays of Pinang assert that this species is of very rare occurrence. During a residence of twenty years at Singapore, Dr. Montgomerie observed it but in a solitary instance. The physiognomy of this species bears a striking resemblance to that of a thorough-bred bull-dog, which, in a somewhat less degree also may be said of the following.\n\n*Sub-Gen.* *Chersydrus,* Cuvier.\u2014Head and body uniformly covered with small scales.\n\n**ACROCHORDUS GRANULATUS,** Schneider.\n\nSyn.\u2014Hydrus granulatus, Schneider.\nAngvis granulatus, Schneider.\nAcrochordus fasciatus, Shaw.\n\n* This sub-gen. was founded upon the erroneous supposition that *Acrochordus fasciatus*, Shaw, possessed venomous organs.\nAcrochordus dubius, Shaw.\nPelamis granulatus, Daudin.\nChersydrus (A. fasciatus, Shaw), Cuvier.\nAcrochordus fasciatus, apud Raffles.\nChersydrus granulatus, Merrem apud Wagler.\nAcrochordus fasciatus, apud Schlegel.\n\n\"Ular limpa\"* or \"Ular laut\" of the Malays.\n\nYoung.\u2014Blackish-brown or liver-coloured; the head with a few scattered yellowish-white spots, the rest of the body with numerous rings of the latter colour, some interrupted on the back, others on the abdomen.\n\nAdult.\u2014The dark colours fade to a dull greyish-black, uniform on the back, and the sides and abdomen present alternate dark and whitish vertical bands. Iris black, pupil vertically contracted; tongue whitish.\n\nHab.\u2014Rivers and sea-coast of the Malayan Peninsula and Islands. Bay of Manilla, New Guinea, Timor, Java, Sumatra, Coromandel.\n\nThis species appears not to exceed about 3 ft. in length. The body is less bulky and the skin less loose than in A. javanicus; but the form is more compressed, particularly the sword or car-like tail, and, like that of the pelagic venomous serpent, appears exclusively calculated to aquatic habits. The scales also resemble those of the latter, and are generally smaller than in A. javanicus. Those of the back, the largest, are rounded rhombic, each with a minute tubercle in the centre. The skin in the interstices is finely wrinkled. On the abdomen the scales are mucronate, with a sharp, reclining central point. In both species the medial line is raised by two or three quincunx rows of scales with their points overlapping each other. The orbit is surrounded by a ring of scales a little larger than the rest. The nostrils, pierced high up on the muzzle, are almost vertical, slightly more so than they are in A. javanicus. In both they are tubular, larger in the present species, sinuous, and provided with a deeply seated membranous fold, which can hermetically close the passage. The mouth is secured in a similar manner by a central arched notch and two lateral protuberances, which correspond to a protuberance and two lateral cavities in the lower jaw. This contrivance also occurs in Hydrus, and to a certain extent in Homalopsis. With the exception of the dentition and the absence of venomous organs, in anatomical details both species of Acrochordus closely resemble Hydrus. As observed by M. Schlegel, the most striking feature is the great development of the lung, which occupies nearly three-fourths of the extent of the abdominal cavity. A somewhat\n\n* Limpa\u2014i.e., liver, liver-coloured.\nsimilar arrangement also occurs in Homalopsis. All the maxillary teeth (inter-maxillary none) are strong, pointed, inwardly reclining and disposed in double or treble rows. The three anterior teeth are the shortest; the upper jaw has on each side upwards of twenty teeth, the lower three or four less. The palatal teeth number twelve on each side, the pterygoid nine, and are shorter than the rest.\n\n*Homalopsis granulatus* is of no rare occurrence in the sea of the Malayan coasts, although, according to Raffles, it is rarely seen on the coasts of Sumatra. At Pinang they are found among the fishes taken in the stakes some three or four miles distant from the coast. M. Schlegel is mistaken in stating that this species never inhabits the sea,* and in censuring M. Eschscholtz for his stating that the fishermen often take it in the Bay of Manilla. A female of the following dimensions had six eggs:\n\nLength of the head . . . . o feet 6 inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . 2 \" 7 1/2 inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . o \" 3 1/2 \"\n2 \" 11 1/2 \"\n\nGreatest circumference, 4 inches.\n\nThe egg is cylindrical, soft, coriaceous, whitish, about 1 1/2 inch in length. In each egg was coiled up a living young one of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . o 3/8 inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . 9 inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . 1 1/2 inch.\n\n10 1/8 inches.\n\nGreatest circumference, 1 inch. In food and general habits this species resembles the pelagic venomous serpents; in its element it is active, but on dry land, blinded by the daylight, it is sluggish and of uncertain movements.\n\nFam.

Schlegel. Of three individuals observed, two were taken by Sir W. Norris and W. T. Lewis, Esq., in the hills of Pinang, the third by Dr. Montgomerie at Singapore. The largest was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . . . 3\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) inches.\n\" trunk . . . . . . 11\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\)\" .\n\" tail . . . . . . 1\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\" inch.\n\n1 ft. 1\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\" .\n\nCircumference, \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\)\" inch.\n\nThe livery bears a remarkable resemblance to that of *Calamaria alba*, Linn\u00e9 (*C. brachyorrhus*, Schlegel), from which it, however, differs in the absence of the anterior frontal shields, and in having thirteen instead of seventeen longitudinal series of scales.\n\n**Calamaria Linnei**, H.

Linnei* by M. Schlegel, who, however, does not mention that the two or three anterior teeth on each side of the lower jaw are longer than the rest. Of six individuals from the hills of Pinang, the largest individual measured:\n\nLength of the head . . . . . . 0\\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . . . 10\\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . . . 0\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) inch.\n\n11 inches.\n\nCircumference of the neck \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\), of the trunk \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) inch.\n\n**Calamaria longiceps**, N.S.\n\nStrongly iridescent soot-coloured, a shade lighter beneath; the scuta and scutella edged with whitish. Eyes and tongue black.\n\nScuta, 131; scutella, 26.\n\nHab.\u2014Pinang.\n\nThe head is elongated, narrow, conical, the muzzle rounded, projecting over the lower jaw. The anterior frontals are much smaller than the frontals, which on the sides occupy the place of the absent frenal shield, and thus reach the second upper labial; the nasal is very small, rectangular, perforated by the rather large nostril near the lower anterior angle. The eye is comparatively large, between an obliquely placed rectangular preorbital and a similar postorbital shield; the supraorbitals are narrow, rectangular; the vertical, moderate, pentagonal, arched, and somewhat narrower at the anterior margin. The occipitals, the largest, are elongated, bordered below by the large fifth upper labial, and behind by a single pair of post-occipitals. Each jaw has five pairs of labials. Of the two pairs of mentals, the anterior is the longer, and is enclosed by the rostral and three anterior labials, the posterior pair by the fourth labial. The teeth are minute, sharp, reclining, all of equal size. The trunk is cylindrical, narrowed towards both extremities, covered with fifteen longitudinal series of smooth rhombic imbricate scales. The abdomen is arched, the short tail tapering to a blunt point. This species approaches to *Calamaria alba*, Linn\u00e9 (*C. brachyorrhos*, Schlegel), but differs by its elongated shape of the shields of the head and its larger\neyes. A single individual, captured by W. T. Lewis, Esq., on the Great Hill of Pinang, was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . . . . . . . 8 inches.\n\" \" trunk . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 inches.\n\nCircumference of the trunk \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), of the neck \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\), at the root of the tail \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) inch.\n\n**Calamaria sagittaria.**\n\nSyn.\u2014Calamaria sagittaria, Cantor: Spicil.\n\nHead yellow or white, marbled with black, forming a streak above the citrine lips; neck white, with a black arrow-shaped mark; back partly ash, partly rust-coloured, with a medial series of distant minute black spots; sides bluish-black or grey, with a narrow black line above; beneath citrine, the throat marbled with black, and with a minute black spot near the lateral angle of each scutum. Iris golden, tongue carmine.\n\nScuta, 216 to 227; scutella, 57 to 70.\n\nHab.\u2014Malayan Peninsula.\nBengal, Assam.\n\nBut for the diminutive size and the reduced shields of the head and throat, this species might be taken for a *Coronella*. The head is but little distinct, depressed, ovate, covered by the normal number of shields. The anterior frontals are very small, pentagonal; the frenal short, rectangular. The nostrils are rather large, piercing the middle of the nasal. The eyes are large, prominent, with one preorbital, two postorbitals; the upper jaw, but slightly longer than the lower, has on each side six labials, the lower seven, enclosing two pairs of small mentals. The temples are covered by three shields. The trunk, with seventeen longitudinal series of smooth rhomboidal imbricate scales, is slightly thicker towards the middle than at the extremities; the back throughout depressed, forming an angle with the sides, and the abdomen is flat, which makes a vertical section of the body square. The tail is very slender, tapering to a sharp point, and exceeds one-fifth of the entire length. The teeth are very minute, of equal size. A single specimen from the Malayan Peninsula was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . . . . . . . 8 inches.\n\" \" trunk . . . . . . . . . . . . 9 inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 inches.\n\n11 inches.\nCircumference of the trunk \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\), of the neck and root of the tail \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) inch.\n\nIn Bengal this species is of no uncommon occurrence, particularly during the rainy season, when the water compels the serpents to leave the shady recesses which most of them occupy to avoid the heat of the day. The present species appears to be closely allied to the African *C. arctiventris*, Schlegel.\n\nOf the preceding four species, the three first appear at Pinang exclusively to inhabit the hills, but the variety of *C. lumbricoides* occurs at Singapore in valleys. They are nowhere to be met in numbers. They are of gentle, peaceable habits, never attempting to bite, and scarcely to escape. They are sluggish, move but slowly and to a short distance, even when compelled by danger, and soon resume the motionless position which they appear to affect. The remarkable abstinence of most of their congeners they possess but in a very limited degree. In captivity they refuse food, and soon expire; besides, they are so delicate that slight pressure in examining them is sufficient to kill them. Their bodies are very smooth, and brilliantly reflect rainbow-colours, which continue in preserved specimens long after the gay livery has faded. They feed upon slugs, earthworms, and insects. The stomach of a *C. sagittaria* contained remains of an *Iulus* and some sand. In general appearance and habits these species of *Calamaria* strongly resemble the Malayan *Elaps* (*vide infra*).\n\n**Gen. Coronella**, Laurenti.\n\nHead above covered with large plates, of which one between the eyes; sides of the head and occiput with imbricate scales; trunk narrowed near the head, thicker towards the middle; tail conical, elongated, tapering to a sharp point.\n\n**Coronella baliodeira**, Schlegel.\n\n**Syn.**\u2014Patza tutta, Russell, i. pl. 29?\n\n- Coluber pictus, Daudin?\n- Coluber Plini, Merrem?\n- Coronella baliodeira, Boie MS.\n\nAbove lighter or darker olive-brown, yellowish on the head, the scales minutely dotted with dark brown; the anterior part of the trunk with a number of distant transversal ocellated lines, composed of single transversal series of white scales edged with black, labial shields yellow edged with black; beneath, pearl-coloured or yellowish-white; iris golden, lower half blackish; tongue black.\n\nScuta, 122 to 132; scutella, 65 to 72.\n\n**Hab.**\u2014Pinang.\n\nJava.\nOf two individuals from the hills of Pinang, the larger was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . . . 6\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . . . 8\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . . . 3\\(\\frac{8}{8}\\)\"\"\n\n1 ft. 1 inch.\n\nCircumference of the neck \\(\\frac{4}{8}\\), of the trunk \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\), of the root of the tail \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) inch.\n\nBoth agree with the description of M. Schlegel, except in having two small preorbitals instead of one. Russell's No. 29, from Casemcotta, which, according to M. Schlegel, is *Coluber pictus*, Daudin, *C. Plinii*, Merrem, is probably intended to represent the present species. It is of fierce habits.\n\n**Gen. Xenodon**, *H.

It differs from the description of M. Schlegel in having twenty-one longitudinal series of scales instead of nineteen, and on the right side three preorbitals. Labials on each side \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n\nThe variety described as *Coronella albocincta* inhabits Assam, Chirra-Punji, Darjeeling, and Midnapore (Bengal). It differs from those of the southern localities in having the head not distinct from the trunk, and its shields are shorter. The eyes are smaller, and, owing to the much swollen cheeks, appear sunk, which, with the remarkably shelving profile, contribute to render the physiognomy singularly scowling. The largest specimen in the Museum of the Asiatic Society measures in length 2 feet \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\) inches, of which the head \\( \\frac{6}{8} \\), the trunk 2 feet \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\), and the tail 3 inches.

The fifth upper maxillary tooth is removed from the preceding, which, in addition to the general shape of the head and the lax integuments, imparts to this serpent a striking resemblance to the venomous genus Bungarus. In fierceness it resembles the preceding species. The only individual observed was captured near the summit of the Great Hill of Pinang, where it had seized a large Euprepis rufescens, Shaw. It was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . 0 feet 1 inch.\n\" trunk . . . . 2 \" 8\\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) inches.\n\" tail . . . . 0 \" 7\\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) \"\n\n3 \" 5 \"\n\nCircumference of the neck \\(1\\frac{5}{6}\\), of the trunk \\(2\\frac{4}{5}\\) inches.\n\nLYCODON EFFRENIS, N.S.\n\nShining bluish-black above, with a few minute white spots, not affecting the ground colour; the throat, lips, and a band bordering the sides of the head from the muzzle to the hind head, buff-coloured, finely marbled with black; beneath, strongly iridescent, pale bluish-black, the scuta with whitish edges; the body encircled\n\n* According to M. Schlegel, who observes that a specimen has been forwarded from Bengal by M. Duvauzel. No specimen exists in the Museum of the Asiatic Society, nor are the natives acquainted with the species.\nby a number (eleven) of broad distant buff rings, above with indented margins; eyes black, pupil elliptical; tongue whitish.\n\nScuta, 228; scutella, 72.\n\nHab.\u2014Pinang.\n\nThe head is elongated, ovate, depressed, broader than the neck, the muzzle rounded, slightly projecting; the anterior frontals are orbicular pentagonal, much smaller than the frontals, which are bent over the sides, substituting the absent frenal, so as to meet the second upper labial; the nasal is small, rectangular, obliquely wedged in between the rostral, the two pairs of frontals, and the anterior upper labial; the nostril large, piercing the middle of the shield; the vertical is elongated pentagonal, broader in front, so as to render the posterior part of the moderate supraorbitals broader than the anterior; the occipitals are the largest, elongated, on each side surrounded by three scales, somewhat longer than the rest covering the temples, and behind by two small postoccipitals. The eyes are proportionally large and prominent, surrounded by one preorbital and two smaller postorbitals, the lower of which touches the narrow projecting fifth upper labial, which with the fourth borders the lower part of the orbit; the jaws are covered by eight pairs of upper, nine of lower labials. The gape is moderate; the particulars of the dentition noted in *L. platurinus* exist in the present species. The two anterior of the three pairs of small elongated mental shields are bordered by the six anterior pairs of labials; behind by a number of small scales. The trunk is slender, decreasing towards both extremities, with seventeen longitudinal series of smooth, rhomboidal, slightly imbricate scales. The back is depressed, forming an angle with the compressed somewhat bulging sides. The latter are joined to the flat narrow abdomen under a right angle on the sides of the scuta, so that the vertical section of the body is quadrangular. A single individual found by Sir Wm. Norris on the Great Hill of Pinang was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . . . 0\\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . . . 9\\(\\frac{6}{5}\\) inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . . . 2\\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) \"\n\n1 ft. 0\\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) inch.\n\nCircumference of the neck \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\), of the trunk \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\), of the root of the tail \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) inch.\n\nIn fierceness the present species resembles its congeners, but, unlike them, it raises vertically the anterior part of the body, and bites after a few oscillating movements from side to side. *Lycodon platurinus* and *aulicus*, like many other harmless and some venomous serpents, the pupils of which are vertically closed by\nthe light, prepare to attack horizontally coiled on the ground, with the head bent close to the body, and drawn as far backwards as possible, when, suddenly uncoiling the anterior part of the body, they dart obliquely upwards, but as they are blinded, not always in the direction apparently aimed at, and they frequently miss the aim.\n\n**Gen.

It has two small postorbitals, one elongated preorbital, one minute irregularly hexagonal frenal, and on each side eight upper, nine lower labial shields. The trunk is covered by twenty-one longitudinal series of smooth imbricate scales, which are rhombic on the sides, rhomboidal above, all with rounded points. The teeth are of uniform size, and, as Russell correctly describes them, very small, reflex, sharp, numerous. The dentition, therefore, sufficiently indicates that the species cannot be placed in the gen. *Lycodon*, to which it has been referred by MM. H. Boie, Wagler, and Schlegel.

Java, Sumatra, Cochin China, Tenasserim, Assam.\n\nThis species is numerous in marshes and paddy-fields, and often becomes a tenant of outhouses, where during the day it remains concealed, till nightfall favours its pursuit after rats. It is, however, equally diurnal, preying upon smaller birds, lizards, and frogs. Assam produces a local variety distinguished by eighteen instead of seventeen longitudinal series of scales, of which the three upper ones are all lineated, whereas normally such is the case on those of the posterior part of the body. It makes a vigorous defence, and in darting at an enemy is capable of raising nearly the anterior two-thirds of the body from the ground. In a female were found twenty-three whitish, soft, cylindrical eggs, of which the largest measured $1\\frac{1}{8}$ inch in length. The largest individual observed was of the following dimensions:\n\n| Length of the head | . . . . o feet $1\\frac{4}{8}$ inch. |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------|\n| \" trunk           | . . . . 4 \" $3\\frac{4}{8}$ inches. |\n| \" tail            | . . . . o \" $10\\frac{4}{8}$ \"      |\n\nGreatest circumference, $3\\frac{6}{8}$ inches.\n\nHabits and general appearance link the present species to Col. dhunnades, Cantor,* and Col. mucosus, Linn\u00e9 (Col.

In addition to two postorbitals there is an elongated crescent-shaped\ninfraorbital resting on the sixth and seventh upper labials. The latter are eight on each side, of which the fifth, broad hexagonal, borders the orbit; the following are elongated, gradually increasing in size. The lower labials, nine on each side, lie on the chin in contact with two pairs of elongated shields. The nostrils are rather large, orbicular, opening near the margin of the anterior frontals. The frenal is small, obliquely situated between the surrounding shields. The temples are covered by two pairs of elongated shields. The gape is wide, the teeth minute, of equal length. The trunk is slender, much compressed, with seventeen longitudinal series of smooth, rhombic, subimbricate scales, of which the central series is hexagonal. The abdomen narrow, arched. The tail is very slender, elongated, tapering to a sharp point.\n\nA solitary individual, discovered by Sir William Norris on the Great Hill of Pinang, was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . . . 0\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . . . 10 inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . . . 4\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) \"\n\n1 ft. 3\\(\\frac{2}{8}\\)\"\"\n\nCircumference of the neck \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\), of the trunk 1, of the root of the tail \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) inch.

Beneath, carnation, dotted with umber, sometimes assuming the shape of large irregular spots.

Of the nine crown shields the occipitals are distinguished by their reduced size and frequent subdivision in two linear interoccipitals, bordered by two large polygonal postoccipitals, enclosing a smaller third, linear. Behind the latter appears on each side a small hard tubercle, covered like the rest of the hind-head with minute polygonal scales. Each temple is protected by five to six large shields, and as many smaller resting upon the labials. The nasal is large, pyramidal, with the rounded nostril in the centre, and the apex wedged in between the three frenals, placed obliquely or vertically one above the other. The eye is large, prominent, encircled by a supraorbital and seven smaller shields, so that none of the upper labials reach the orbit. The lips are arched, and outwardly appear to reach to the hind-head; but the commissure, or the angle of the mouth, is situated immediately below the eye, which greatly reduces the opening of the mouth. Of the nine pairs of upper labials, the anterior six are narrow, but very deep and bulging; the posterior three are broader, elongated; the inferior labials, eleven pairs, are, as well as the rostral, greatly reduced by the three pairs of very large mentals. The front view of the head grotesquely resembles that of a mastiff. All the teeth are strong, but the front tooth on each side of the lower jaw is longer than the rest; the palatal rows are very close together and converging. The trunk is much compressed, covered by thirteen longitudinal series of scales, of which the dorsal row is composed of very large hexagonal ones, each with a strong keel; the rest are smooth, rhombic, imbricate. The abdomen is very narrow, and the sides of the scuta are bent upwards. The tail is elongated, slender, tapering, and much less compressed than the trunk. Of two individuals from the hills of Pinang, the larger, a male, was of the following dimensions:\u2014\nLength of the head . . . . o foot i inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . 1 \" 11 inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . o \" 11 1/8 \"\n2 feet 11 1/8 \"\n\nCircumference of the neck i inch, of the trunk 15, of the root of the tail 7 inch. In a female were observed four cylindrical whitish eggs, each 6 inch in length. The stomach contained a few remains of insects.\n\nThis species is closely allied to *Dipsas carinata*, Schlegel (*Amblycephalus*, Kuhl; *Pareas*, Wagler), in which also the dorsal series of scales are keeled. M. Schlegel's short description and figure appear to have been taken from an immature specimen.\n\nThe preceding four species are very fierce; their mode of attack is that of *Lycodon aulicus*. Kuhl has observed vibrating movements in the tail of *Dipsas multimaculata*, which, however, are also exhibited by *Dipsas trigonata*, Schneider (*Col. catenularies*, Daudin), *D. cynodon*, Cuvier; and among the venomous serpents by *Vipera Russelli*, Shaw, and several Asiatic species of *Trigonoccephalus*, when they are irritated and preparing to bite.\n\n**Gen. Herpetodryas, H. Boie.**\n\nHead trigonal, very long, depressed, smooth, rather sharp; trunk and tail very elongated; scales, particularly those of the tail, large; those of the back partially carinate; in other respects resembling *Coluber*.\n\n**Herpetodryas oxycephalus**, Reinwardt.\n\nSYN.\u2014*Coluber oxycephalus*, Reinwardt.\n*Gonyosoma viride*, Wagler.\n*Herpetodryas oxycephalus*, apud Schlegel.\n\nHead, above, shining dark green with a blackish straight line from the nostrils to the angle of the mouth; lips and throat pale yellowish-green; trunk sea-green, changing to light yellowish-green on the lower part of the sides\u2014all the scales with black edges; the anterior half of the tail, separated from the trunk by a transversal orange band, ochre, gradually changing to greyish-brown on the posterior half, all the scales edged with black. Abdominal scuta light yellowish-green with pale yellow edges; subcaudal scutella grey with black margins.

The teeth are numerous; in each row the anterior six or eight are longer than the rest, which gradually decrease. The scales of the trunk, in twenty-five longitudinal series, are rhombic with rounded points, imbricate, and all smooth except those covering the spinous processes, which are faintly lineated.\n\nOf two individuals from the hills of Pinang, the larger, taken by Sir William Norris, was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . o foot 1\\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . 3 feet 4 inches.\n\" \" tail . . . 1 foot 1 inch.\n\n4 feet 6\\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) inches.\n\nCircumference of the neck 2, of the trunk 3, of the root of the tail 1\\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) inch. The ferocious habits of this serpent have been accurately described by M. Reinwardt. It has in a remarkable degree the power of laterally compressing the neck and the anterior part of the body, when the greyish-blue skin becomes visible between the separated scales. In such state of excitement it raises nearly the anterior third vertically from the ground, continues fixed during several seconds with vibrating tongue, and bites. It then throws itself down, to rise to a renewed attack. A similar mode of attack characterizes the following species\u2014viz. *Dryinus*, nasutus, Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de (Russell i. pl. xii. and xvi.); *D. prasinus*, Reinwardt (*Dryophis prasina*, apud Schlegel); *Deptophis pictus*, Gmelin; and *Leptophis caudalineatus*.\n\nGen. *Dryinus*,* Merrem, 1820.\n\nUpper jaw much longer than the lower; muzzle attenuated, more or less acute at the apex, which in some species is mucronate and moveable.\n\n**Dryinus prasinus**, Rienwardt.\n\nSyn.\u2014Seba, ii. tab. liii. fig 4.\nColuber nasutus,\u2020 Shaw apud Russell, ii. pl. xxiv.\nDryinus nasutus, Bell (not Merrem, 1820).\n\n* In H.

Bell already in 1825 had published his article on *Leptophina* (comprising *Dryinus*, Merrem, and *Leptophis*, Bell).\n\n\u2020 The specific name was previously applied by Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de in 1790 to the other Asiatic species.\nDryiophis prasinus, Reinwardt.\nTragops, Wagler.\nDryinus nasutus, Bell apud Horsfield: \"Life of Rattles.\"\nPasserita, Gray.\nDryiphis prasina, apud Schlegel.\n\"Ular daun\" of the Malays.\n\nLeek-green above, with some irregular white and black oblique lines, paler on the cheeks and upper lips; tail cinnamon; under lips and throat white, scuta and scutella light green or mother-of-pearl, on each side with a white or pale yellow longitudinal line, below which in some a second green line.

It may readily be distinguished from *Drymias nasutus*, Lac\u00e9p. (Merrem, not Bell; Russell, i. pl. xii. xiii.), by two, sometimes three frenals on each side. The trunk is covered by fifteen longitudinal series of smooth rhomboidal scales with rounded points, imbricate so as to appear linear; those of the tale are all broad rhombic. The anterior upper maxillary teeth gradually increase towards the sixth, which is the longest, and enclosed in a pointed fold of gingiva. The following teeth, commencing at a short interval, are short, but the last is very long, with a furrow on the convex edge. The inferior maxillary teeth also increase in length towards the sixth, the longest, and are protected by a broad triangular scabbard, containing several additional loose teeth; the rest are uniformly small, commencing at a short interval from the sixth. The palatal are uniformly very short.

The trunk is covered by fifteen longitudinal series of smooth imbricate scales; the central dorsal series is wedge-shaped, in some almost hexagonal; the next six are linear; but the lowest, as well as all the scales of the tail, are broad rhombic with rounded points.

In habits and mode of attack this species resembles *Drymias prasinus*, but it is not exclusively arboreal. Probably no instance affords a more striking difference in colours between species and variety than the present: the former with dazzling brilliant livery, the latter in its plain dull colours. Both attain to similar size: the largest male examined was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . . 0 feet 1\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . . 2 \", 6 inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . . 1 foot 1 inch.\n\n3 feet 8\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inches.\n\nCircumference of the neck \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), of the trunk 2, of the root of the tail 1 inch.

Lips, throat and abdominal surface pale metallic citrine; the tail beneath with a black central line. Iris golden, dotted with brown; pupil round; tongue bluish-white, the forked part black.\n\nYoung.\u2014Upper parts of the body Indian red, with metallic reflections.\n\nScuta, 183 to 188; scutella, 105 to 110.\n\nHab.\u2014Pinang, Singapore.\n\nThe head large, less depressed than in the preceding species, the muzzle broad, blunt; cheeks tumid: all the shields of the crown are short and broad, except the vertical, which is laterally arched, and very narrow behind. There is a single elongated postoccipital, and the rest of the hind head is covered with broad hexagonal shields. Each temple is covered by two pairs of large shields, in front of which a pair of very minute ones, bordering upon the equally small postorbitals. The eye is large, prominent; the preorbital and the linear frenal proportionally small; the nostrils large, opening in the middle of the nasal; the rostral\nbroad, slightly arched beneath. The labials, nine on each side of both jaws, resemble those of the preceding species. The mouth is large; the maxillary teeth strong, distant. In the lower jaw the anterior ones gradually increase in length till the fourth, which appears like a canine; the rest, as well as the palatal teeth, are all smaller, of uniform length. The chin is covered by the second pair of labials and two pairs of mentals, of which the posterior pair is elongated. The trunk is strong, less compressed than in the preceding species, with thirteen series of smooth imbricate scales, of which the two lowest series are large rhombic with rounded points, the next four elongated rhomboidal (linear), and the odd central dorsal rhomboidal, not larger than the rest. The tail is covered with broad hexagonal, not imbricate, scales. The abdomen is narrow, flattened; the centre part of the scuta with strongly arched margins; the sides turned upwards and forming a continued sharp lateral ridge. The tail is slender, tapering; its vertical section nearly square.\n\nOf this species but two individuals were observed: a young one at Singapore, an adult on the Great Hill of Pinang.

The indifferent figure of *Ahaetula caudolineata* in \"Illustrations of Indian Zoology,\" which appears to be all which has been published concerning this species, has led M. Schlegel to suppose it was intended to represent a variety of *Leptophis pictus*, although the black outline of the head is correct.\n\n**Leptophis ornatus**, Shaw.\n\n**Syn.**\u2014Schrenckzer, t. 606.\nSeba, i. t. xciv., fig. 7; h. t. vii., fig. 1; t. lxi., fig. 2.\nRussell, ii. pl. 2, Kalla Jin.\nColuber ornatus, Shaw.\nColuber ibiboboca, Daudin.\nColuber ornatus, Merrem apud Horsfield: \"Life of Raffles.\"\nChrysopelea paradisi, H.

The latter has the tongue alternately vermilion and black. Individuals without the frenal shield are not uncommon, and such was the one described by H. Boie as a distinct species (Chrysopelea paradisi). It inhabits the Malayan hills and valleys, but is there apparently less numerous than in Bengal.

The female has six to eight white elongated cylindrical eggs, about \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch in length. It differs from the other species in its being deprived of the power of compressing and expanding the anterior part of the body, and in its gentleness.

Of the three postorbitals the lowest is the longest, wedged in between the fifth, sixth, and seventh upper labials, of\n\n* Vide *Ptychozoon homalocephalum*, supra.\nwhich the fifth is the only one which reaches the orbit; the eye is moderate, prominent; the upper labials are nine, the lower eleven on each side. The mouth is very large, the teeth small, crowded, except the two last of the upper jaw, which are longer than the rest. The trunk is slightly compressed, covered by nineteen longitudinal series of scales, of which the two lowest are broad rhombic, the rest elongated rhomboidal with rounded points; those of the back lineated. The abdomen is broad, arched. This variety differs in nothing but colours from *Tropidonotus umbratus*, Daudin, and, to judge by the description of M. Schlegel, it appears to be identical with *T. trianguligerus*. In the Malayan valleys the variety is very numerous; in Bengal it is less so, but there the species abounds in and near fresh water, where it preys upon fishes and frogs. The variety attains to a size similar to that of the species, both of which are equally fierce.

The scales of the trunk are disposed in seventeen longitudinal series, of which the two lowest on each side are hexagonal, each scale with a minute round protuberance near the apex; the scales of the next two series present a raised line terminating in a protuberance, but the remaining scales are elongated rhomboidal, with truncated, slightly notched points, keeled, imbricate. These marks become indistinct when the integuments are about to be changed, which probably caused them to escape the notice of Russell. This species is not numerous in Bengal, and apparently less so on the Malayan Peninsula. The largest individual measured\u2014\n\nLength of the head . . . . o feet i inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . 2 \" 94 \"\n\" \" tail . . . . o \" 2\u00bd inches.\n\n2 \" 4 \"\n\nCircumference of the neck 16, of the trunk 2\u00bd, of the tail 1\u00bd inch.\n\nThe length of the tail is very variable; in some it is contained 3\u00bd, in other six times in the entire length. This species is very fierce, and prepares to attack by raising the head three or four inches vertically from the ground, and it has the power of flattening and laterally expanding the skin of the anterior part of the body, like *Naja*, but in a much slighter degree. It bites, uttering a faint hissing sound. Frogs and fishes form its food.\n\n**Tropidonotus cerasogaster.**\n\n**Syn.**\u2014Psammophis cerasogaster, Cantor.\n\nAbove, yellowish-brown with pale golden reflections; lighter on the sides, the scales of which in some partially edged with yellow; cheeks, lips, throat, and abdominal surface cherry-coloured, with a bright yellow lateral line from the muzzle to the point of the tail. Iris and tongue cherry-coloured.\n\nScuta, 144 to 149; scutella, 60 to 69.\n\n**Hab.**\u2014Malayan Peninsula.\n\nBengal, Assam.\n\nThe head is elongated, depressed; sides angular, compressed; muzzle truncated; rostral broad, hexagonal, nearly vertical, arched below; the anterior frontals the smallest, next to them the frontals; the rest of the crown shields are narrow, elongated; each occipital bordered by two pairs of elongated temporals, below which three\nsmaller. Nasals rectangular, placed at a right angle with the anterior frontals; nostrils moderate, lateral; the frenal smaller than the nasal; preorbital longer than either; the eye moderate, prominent. Besides three postorbitals, there is a minute infraorbital wedged in between the fifth and sixth upper labials, of which but a small portion of the sixth touches the orbit below. The lips are straight, turned up near their commissure, covered with eight or nine pairs of upper, ten lower shields. The mouth is large; the teeth small, crowded, of equal length. The trunk is cylindrical, compressed, covered with nineteen longitudinal series of imbricate, elongated rhomboidal scales, with rounded, slightly notched points, keeled, except the two lowest series on each side, which are larger than the rest, rhombic, smooth. The abdomen is broad, arched; the tail robust at the root, cylindrical, tapering to a sharp point. A solitary individual from Province Wellesley was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . o foot 6\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . : i \" 5\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . o \" 6\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) \"\n2 feet 6\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch.\n\nCircumference of the neck \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\), of the trunk \\(1\\frac{1}{8}\\), of the root of the tail \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) inch.\n\nIn Bengal this species is not numerous. It is very fierce, attacks in a vertical attitude, but without expanding the anterior part of the body. Its food is that of the preceding. The elongated angular head makes this species resemble a *Psammophis*.\n\n**Tropidonotus junceus**, N.S.\n\nHead above, shining light brown, lips and throat gamboge; from the angle of the mouth an oblique gamboge band, both joining under a sharp angle on the neck; trunk and tail dull greyish-olive, with a series of distant rounded whitish spots on each side; each scutum and scutellum with a small black spot on the sides, which, as well as their anterior margins, are minutely dotted with brown. Iris black with a golden ring; tongue small, greyish.\n\nScuta, 157; scutella, 83.\n\nHab.\u2014Pinang.\n\nThe head is elongated ovate, with the sides angular, compressed; the muzzle truncated; the rostral shield moderate, square, deeply arched beneath, vertically fixed; the anterior frontals small, tetragonal; the frontals larger; angularly bent over the side, where they border the small square frenal; the other crown shields are rather small, the occipitals on each side bordered by small elongated shields, like the rest of the temples; the eyes large,\nprominent; preorbital, one; postorbitals, three; nasal rectangular; nostrils lateral, large, rounded; upper labials, nine, of which the fourth, fifth, and sixth border the orbit; lower labials, eleven; mentals, two pairs, elongated. The lips are slightly arched, the mouth wide; the teeth small, crowded; the last upper maxillary tooth longer than the rest. The trunk is very slender, cylindrical, with the centre of the back raised, forming a sharp ridge, the sides bulging near the abdomen, which is arched. The scales are imbricate, very elongated rhomboidal, with the apex notched, except the two lowest series on each side, which are broad rhombic; they are all sharply keeled, and disposed on the anterior part of the trunk in nineteen, on the middle part in seventeen longitudinal series. The tail elongated, cylindrical, very slender, tapering to a fine point. A single individual observed on the Great Hill of Pinang by W. T. Lewis, Esq., was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . o foot 9\\(\\frac{6}{8}\\) inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . i \" 7 inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . o \" 7\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) \"\n2 feet 3\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) \"\n\nCircumference of the neck \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\), of the trunk \\(1\\frac{1}{8}\\), of the root of the tail \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\) inch.\n\nLike most of the Asiatic species of this genus, the present is of fierce habits. It twice unprovokedly bit a woodcutter who happened to pass it. The bite of course was productive of no consequences except a slight momentary pain. The very slender make and the elongated tail are characters which approach this species to the arboreal Colubrid\u00e6.\n\nGen.

The rest are broken up in small, irregular, smooth pieces, differing in outline in each individual. The small eye, placed in a partly vertical, partly lateral position, is surrounded by a preorbital, a postorbital, and two or three infraorbitals. The frenal is comparatively large, irregular tetragonal. The anterior seven upper labials are narrow, very high; the posterior five or six each divided in two. A similar arrangement is observed in the inferior thirteen or fourteen of which the posterior six or seven are very small. On the chin there is a pair of elongated shields immediately behind the two pairs of labials. The posterior upper maxillary tooth is longer than the rest, and furrowed. The three anterior teeth in the lower jaw are longer than the rest. The trunk is covered with imbricate, finely lineated and keeled scales, of a rhomboidal form, with rounded points, disposed on the anterior part in twenty-five, on the posterior part\nin seventeen longitudinal series. The tail is robust, tapering, and prehensile. In the Malayan countries this species occurs in numbers in rivers, estuaries, and occasionally along the sea-coasts. It feeds upon fishes. Single individuals measuring between three and four feet in length are of very rare occurrence. Of a great number the largest was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . o feet 1\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . 2 \" 3 inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . 0 \" 7 \"\n2 \" 11\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) \"\n\nCircumference of the neck 1\\(\\frac{7}{8}\\), of the trunk 3\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), of the root of the tail 1\\(\\frac{6}{8}\\) inch.

The anterior frontal is either entire and of a large rhombic shape, or consisting of two triangular shields; the frenal is elongated, rectangular; the small eye is situated more laterally than in the preceding species, and surrounded by two postorbitals, one preorbital, and two infraorbitals. The seven anterior upper labials are very high, the posterior five are double; of sixteen or seventeen lower labials the nine anterior are the highest. The last tooth in the upper jaw is furrowed, and as well as the three or four anterior palatal and inferior maxillary teeth, longer than the rest. The folds of gingiva enveloping the teeth are very ample, and contain, in addition to the fixed, numerous, five to six deep, accessory teeth. The chin is covered by four pairs of elongated scales, decreasing in length from the centre towards the labials. The scales of the trunk are rhombic, imbricate, slightly keeled and finely lined, disposed on the anterior part in thirty-nine, on the posterior in twenty-five longitudinal series. The tail is robust, tapering, and somewhat prehensile.

The locality from whence this specimen was obtained is not known; Bengal is given by M. Schlegel.\nThe vertical in extent nearly equals each of the short occipitals. The eye is rather large, prominent, surrounded by a single elongated, arched preorbital and two postorbitals, of which the inferior is the larger, bordering the fifth and sixth upper labials. Of the latter there are eight on each side: the fourth borders the eye below; the two posterior are broken up in small pieces. Of the eleven or twelve pairs of lower labials, the four nearest the angle of the mouth are the smallest. The chin is covered by three pairs of oval shields, of which the anterior is the largest, and by some minute scales. The mouth is small, the teeth minute, uniform, except the last upper maxillary tooth, which is the longest, with a furrow on the convex margin. The back is slightly angular in the centre, much depressed; the sides bulging; the abdomen narrow. The anterior part of the trunk is covered with twenty-nine, the posterior with nineteen series of small, smooth, imbricate scales, all rhombic with rounded points. The tail is tapering and compressed.\n\n**Homalopsis enhydris**, Schneider.\n\n**Syn.**\u2014Russell, i. pl. xxx.

The word *ayer* applied to a single species is as eligible as would be *aquas*, *can*, or *wasser*.\nThe head is small, ovate, scarcely distinct; the nostrils are hemispherical, with a slit towards the external margin of the shield; the single anterior frontal is small, rhomboidal, much broader than long; the eye is rather large, prominent, lateral and surrounded by two rather broad postorbitals, one or two narrow preorbitals, and beneath by the fourth upper labial; the frenal is small, rhombic. The external margins of the occipitals are bordered by three elongated shields, and each temple by five similar. The eight upper labials are larger than the ten lower. The chin is covered by two central pairs of elongated shields, between which and the labials is, on each side, a single very elongated shield. The mouth is small, the teeth minute, numerous and equal, except the last tooth of the upper jaw, which is longer than the rest and furrowed. The trunk is very robust, broadly depressed; the sides obliquely compressed, and the abdomen very narrow, flattened. The scales are broad rhomboidal with rounded points, slightly imbricate, and disposed on the anterior part in twenty-five, in the middle in twenty-one, and near the tail in nineteen longitudinal series. The tail is very slender, somewhat compressed, tapering and prehensile. The largest individual was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . . o foot 1 inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . . 1 ,, 5\\(\\frac{6}{8}\\) inches\n\" \" tail . . . . . o ,, 5\\(\\frac{2}{8}\\) \"\n\n2 feet o \"\n\nCircumference of the neck \\(1\\frac{2}{8}\\), of the trunk \\(2\\frac{6}{8}\\), of the root of the tail \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\) inch.\n\nNumbers of this species may be seen in rivers, as well as in irrigated fields and estuaries, preying upon fishes, which, however, it refuses in a state of captivity. It is of timid and peaceful habits. A large female, after having been confined upwards of six months in a glass vessel filled with water, brought forth eleven young ones in the manner noted above under *Acrochordus javanicus*. During the process she lay motionless on the bottom of the vessel; the anterior part of the abdomen was retracted towards the vertebral column, while the muscles of the posterior part were in activity. Shortly after the parturition she expired under a few spasmodic movements, and also two of the young ones died in the course of about two hours, after having, like the rest, shed the integuments. In length they varied from 6 to 6\\(\\frac{2}{8}\\) inches. The living nine presented a singular appearance: they remained a little way below the surface of the water, coiling themselves round the body of an adult male, which was also kept in the vessel, occasionally lifting their heads above the surface to breathe, at the same time resisting the efforts of the senior to free himself. Fishes and aquatic\ninsects were refused, in consequence of which the young ones expired from inanition in the course of less than two months.\n\n**Homalopsis plumbea**, Boie.\n\nSyn.\u2014Hypsirhina, Wagler.\nHypsirhina Hardwickii, Gray: \"Illust.

In addition to the fixed teeth there are several accessory series. The trunk is nearly cylindrical, slightly depressed, covered with small rhombic scales, smooth, and not imbricate, disposed on the anterior part in nineteen, on the posterior part in seventeen longitudinal series. The tail is short, conic, tapering, and slightly prehensile. Two individuals, taken at different times from rivulets in the valley of Pinang, in habits resembled *H. rhinolops*. The larger was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . . o foot 1\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . . i \" 5 inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . . o \" 2\\(\\frac{6}{8}\\)\" \"\ni \" 8\\(\\frac{7}{8}\\)\"\nCircumference of the neck \\( \\frac{15}{8} \\), of the trunk \\( \\frac{24}{8} \\), of the root of the tail \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch.\n\n**Homalopsis leucobalia**, Schlegel, var.\n\n*Young.* \u2014 Above, light brownish-olive, or greenish-grey with single irregular distant brown spots; lips and throat whitish-yellow; the lowest three or four lateral series of scales, and the abdominal surface greenish-white or pearl-coloured.\n\n*Adult.* \u2014 Uniformly blackish-olive above, otherwise like the young. Iris dark brown; pupil elliptical, vertically contracted by the light. Tongue whitish.\n\nScuta, 130 to 148; scutella, 26 to 37.\n\n**Hab.** \u2014 Pinang, Malayan Peninsula.\n\nThe head is very broad, depressed, and the muzzle blunt; the rostral broad, hexagonal, very slightly arched beneath; the superior margin borders the single small elongated anterior frontal, which is of a narrow hexagonal form, broader behind, where it is wedged in between the two broad frontals. The nasals are rather large; nostrils small, crescent-shaped; the vertical very broad, short, hexagonal; occipitals large, elongated with a pair of very broad shields on each side, below which the temples are covered by three smaller shields. The eye is very small, in a half-vertical position, with two postorbitals, one preorbital, which extends to the large oval nasal; frenal none, or when present, excessively minute. Of the five large upper labials, the anterior is the smallest and borders the nasal; the second the preorbital, the third the orbit, and the lower postorbital, the fourth and fifth the temporals. The lower rostral is very small, triangular. The seven or eight inferior labials are much smaller than the upper. The two pairs of mentals are very short. The mouth is small; the teeth are very strong, short, and of nearly equal size, except the furrowed last upper maxillary tooth, and the anterior teeth of the lower jaw, which are longer than the rest. The trunk is robust, back slightly raised in the centre, the sides sloping, their lower half compressed, the abdomen broad, arched. The scales are smooth, rhombic, with rounded points, slightly imbricate; those of the sides have the points bent inwards and firmly adhering to the skin, so as to appear hexagonal. On the anterior part of the trunk they are disposed in twenty-seven, on the posterior in twenty-five longitudinal series. The tail is short, robust, tapering, and somewhat prehensile. In the male the sides are compressed, very high in the middle, and the lower surface is flattened, very broad, more so than is the posterior part of the abdomen. In the female it is shorter, the sides less high, and the lower surface less broad. The largest male of a considerable number was of the following dimensions:\u2014\nLength of the head . . . 0 foot 0\\(\\frac{7}{8}\\) inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . 1 \\(1\\frac{2}{3}\\) inches.\n\" \" tail . . . 0 \\(2\\frac{6}{8}\\) \"\n\\[\n\\text{2 feet } 1\\frac{7}{8} \\text{ inch.}\n\\]\n\nCircumference of the neck \\(1\\frac{7}{8}\\), of the trunk \\(2\\frac{4}{5}\\), of the root of the tail, \\(1\\frac{4}{5}\\) inch. With the exception of its colours, the present offers no difference from *H. leucokalia*, from the rivers of Timor. At Pinang it is numerous not only in fresh water and estuaries, but in the sea at some distance from the shore, where it sometimes occurs in fishing nets. It is of sluggish, not fierce habits, and feeds upon fishes and crustacea, aquatic and pelagic. In a young female the oviduct enclosed four white cylindrical eggs, which when they were observed contained but yolk; each measured about an inch in length.\n\n**Homalopsis hydrina**, N.S.\n\n*Adult.*\u2014Ash-coloured above, with a few scattered black spots on the neck; the back and tail with numerous transversal black bands; the lips, sides, and abdomen uniformly pearl-coloured. Iris ashy; pupil elliptical, vertically contracted by the light; tongue small, whitish.\n\nScuta, 161; scutella, 34.\n\n*Young.*\u2014Resembling the adult, but the ash colour of a much lighter shade.\n\nScuta, 153; scutella, 35.\n\n**Hab.**\u2014Sea off Pinang, and the Malayan Peninsula.\n\nThe head is moderately distinct, elongated, depressed, oval, with rounded blunt muzzle; the rostral shield moderate, hexagonal; its lower margin with a central minute tubercle, on each side of which a triangular impression. The upper margin of the minute triangular lower rostral presents a central cavity, and two lateral elevations fitting into the margin of the upper rostral. A similar contrivance in the pelagic serpents enables them hermetically to close the mouth. As in *H. leucobalia*, the single small anterior frontal is elongated hexagonal, broader behind, and enclosed by the rostral, the nasals, and the frontals. Although the nasals are placed laterally, the small arched linear nostrils open vertically, and send a slit to the posterior margin of the shield; the frontals are hexagonal, smaller than the latter; the vertical is the longest of the crown-shields, very narrow, hexagonal, pointed at both extremities, but broader behind; the supraorbitals are small, narrow; the occipitals are broken up in minor shields\u2014viz., two postoccipitals, in size equal to the occipitals, and a minute conical interoccipital, enclosed by the four shields, with the broader\nextremity wedged in between the occipitals. Each temple is covered with two pairs of large shields, of which the lower borders the fifth, sixth, and seventh upper labials. The eye is very minute, prominent, almost vertically placed, surrounded by two post-orbitals, of which the lower is broad pentagonal, meeting beneath the elongated single oblique preorbital. Thus none of the upper labials border the orbit. The frenal is moderate, pentagonal. Of the seven upper labials the anterior three pairs are much smaller than the rest, which suddenly become very large and deep, so as to make the margin of the lip very bulging in a downward direction. The lower ten or eleven labials are smaller than the upper, except the sixth, which is the largest. The chin with two pairs of shields, of which the anterior is very elongated; the throat with numerous minute scales; the mouth is small, the dentition resembles that of *Homalopsis leucobalia*, var.; the trunk would be orbicular but for the narrow flattened abdomen, the scuta of which are angulated, forming on each side a sharp ridge; the scales are very small, smooth, on the neck disposed in thirty-three, successively in thirty-seven, but near the root of the tail in twenty-nine longitudinal series. Those of the back are rhomboidal with rounded points; those of the sides lanceolate with the point bent inwards, so as to appear truncated, each scale leaving a small square interval, in which appears the naked skin. The tail is short, much compressed, tapering, and slightly prehensile. In the male the sides are very high, and the lower surface very broad, as noted under *H. leucobalia*, var. On the broadest part there are as many as twenty-one longitudinal series of scales. In the female this organ is shorter, the sides less high, and the abdomen less broad.\n\nOf three individuals observed, two were captured in fishing stakes placed in the sea off the shores of Keddah, a third was washed on shore by the waves on the coast adjoining my house at Pinang. The largest male was of the following dimensions:\n\n| Length of the head | 0 foot 0\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) inch. |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------|\n| \" trunk           | 1\\(\\frac{4}{8}\\) inches.      |\n| \" tail            | 0\\(\\frac{2}{8}\\)\"             |\n\n1\\(\\frac{7}{8}\\)\"\"\n\nCircumference of the neck, \\(\\frac{6}{8}\\); of the trunk, \\(\\frac{6}{8}\\); of the root of the tail, \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\); of the middle of the tail, 1; two-eighths from the apex, \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) inch.\n\nIt moved actively and without difficulty on the sand, and did not offer to bite. In one examined the stomach contained remains of two small pelagic fishes. In general appearance and colours the present is more closely allied to the pelagic serpents than any other known species. Whether it exclusively inhabits\nthe sea, or, like *Homalopsis rhinchops*, *enhydrus*, and *leucobalia*, as an occasional visitor, must be a matter of future investigation.\n\n**VENOMOUS SERPENTS.**\n\n**Fam.

The eye is surrounded by two postorbitals, one preorbital, and beneath by the third and fourth upper labials. Of the latter, seven pairs cover the jaws. The trunk is throughout covered by thirteen series of smooth, subimbricate, rhombic scales. The one described by Russell, hitherto the only describer from nature, was a young animal. A similar, upwards of a foot in length, was killed in Province Wellesley.

The nearly equilateral, hexagonal vertical, and the supraorbitals are remarkably small; more so than in any other species of this genus. The occipitals are very narrow elongated; their external margin bordered by two pairs of shields, of which the anterior, the larger,\n\n* The (magnified?) representation of the head of *Calliophis gracilis*, fig. 2, \"Ill.

The eye is sunk, excessively minute, surrounded by two small postorbitals; beneath by the third and fourth upper labials, and by a single narrow triangular preorbital. The latter is placed obliquely, so that the downwards-pointed apex meets the linear posterior part of the nasal, or, as it is considered by some, the frenal. The nostrils are comparatively large. The upper labials number six on each side: the two posterior are the largest. The chin is covered by two pairs of elongated narrow shields, externally bordered by the third and fourth, the largest of the six inferior labials. The gular scales are more numerous than those of *E. intestinalis*. The neck is covered by fifteen, the trunk by thirteen longitudinal series of smooth rhombic scales with rounded points.

Although not numerous, they cannot be said\nto be of rare occurrence. They are strictly terrestrial, and have\ntheir hiding-places under the roots of trees and in the crevices of\nrocks. They are sluggish, awkwardly dragging their long slender\nbodies, and they are generally observed lying motionless, with the\nbody thrown in many irregular folds, but not coiled. Although\nthey are diurnal, their sight, from the minuteness of the pupil,\nappears to be as defective as their sense of hearing, and they may\nbe closely approached without apparently their being aware of\ndanger. If touched with a stick, they make a few strenuous\nefforts to slide away, but they soon stop, and if further pursued,\nthey make some irregular spasmodic-like movements, but they have\nnot been observed to bite. An adult *Elaps bivirgatus*, var., was on\na single occasion seen to raise the head vertically about two inches\nfrom the ground. In captivity they refuse food and water, and\ndie in a short time from inanition. Of a number examined, only\none of the latter species had in the stomach the remains of a small\nserpent, the genus of which could not be determined. M. Schlegel\nhas observed *Calamarie* in the stomach of *Elaps intestinalis*. In\nthe peculiar distribution of colours, in diminutive size, and in\nhabits, they resemble the genus *Calamaria*. It is solely the small-\nness of the mouth which renders the preceding species of *Elaps*\nharmless to man, as from the following it will be perceived that\ntheir venom is as virulent as that of other venomous serpents.\nFrom the diminutive size of the venomous glands, the quantity of\nfluid secreted is small: scarcely more than a drop from each. It\nis a pellucid, colourless fluid, slightly reddening litmus paper.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts to make an adult *Elaps nigro-\nmaculatus* spontaneously bite a fowl, the jaws were forcibly closed\nover a protracted fold of the skin on the inner side of the left thigh\nof the bird. On account of the small gape, some difficulty was\nexperienced in making the jaws close over the fold of the skin, and\nas it appeared doubtful if the fangs had penetrated, the serpent\nwas in a quarter of an hour compelled again to wound the fowl in the skin below the right eye. Twenty minutes after the first wound the fowl became purged, and manifested symptoms of pain in the left thigh, which was continually drawn up towards the body, although the wounds inflicted there and below the eye were, from the smallness of the fangs, barely visible. Twenty-eight minutes after the first wound the bird commenced drooping, occasionally attempting to raise itself, and in ten minutes more soporism occurred, interrupted by spasms of the neck, flow of saliva, and pecking the earth with the beak, while the pupil was spasmodically contracted and alternately dilated. The latter symptoms continued during thirty minutes, when death occurred in an hour after the first wound had been inflicted. Fowls wounded by *Elaps furcatus*, var., and *Elaps livirgatus*, var., expired under similar symptoms, from within an hour and twenty minutes to upwards of three hours. The serpents, which all had forcibly to be made to inflict the wounds, shortly afterwards expired, apparently from the violence to which they had been subjected.\n\n**Gen.

Reinhardt has described the adult from an unique specimen in the Royal Museum, Copenhagen. Spirits of wine changed the brilliant blood-red to a pale yellow colour. The diagnosis must therefore be altered accordingly. The adult appears to differ from the young in having none of the black marks of the head and tail and no lateral white line.\nA single young individual, found by Sir William Norris on the Great Hill of Pinang, was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . o foot 5 inch.\n\" \" trunk : : : : i \" 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches.\n\" \" tail : : : : o \" 3 \"\ni \" 8\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) \"\n\nCircumference of the neck i, of the trunk \\(i\\frac{2}{5}\\), of the root of the tail \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) inch.\n\nThe centre of the back forms a ridge, from whence the sides slope; the abdomen is broad, slightly arched, so that the vertical section of the body becomes broad triangular. The neck is covered by fifteen, the trunk by thirteen longitudinal series of smooth, imbricate, rhomboidal scales. As observed by M. J. Reinhardt, the correspondence of colours, and their distribution, between this species and *Elaps livirgatus*, is very striking. Besides, the number of series of scales is another character approximating this species to the genus *Elaps*.\n\n**Bungarus candidus**, Linn\u00e9.\n\n**Syn.**\u2014Seba, ii. t. lxvi. figs. 3 and 4.\nColuber candidus, Linn\u00e9.\nRussell, i. pl. i.

As noted under *Elaps bivirgatus*, var., the larynx is not attached to the scabbard of the tongue. Of three young individuals from the valley of Pinang and Province Wellesley, the largest was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . . o feet 1 2/8 inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . . 3 \" 5 inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . . 0 \" 4 4/8 \"\n3 \" 10 6/8 \"\nCircumference of the neck 2, of the trunk 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), of the root of the tail 2, of the apex 1\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) inch.\n\nIn the Malayan countries the species of *Bungarus* are not numerous; but *B. candidus* and *fasciatus* are of no uncommon occurrence in Bengal and on the Coromandel Coast, where, however, it should be observed, a class of the natives (\"serpent-charmers\") earn a livelihood by capturing and exhibiting serpents, but this craft is unknown among the Malays. The preceding three species, like the rest of the venomous serpents, are very ferocious when attacked, but unprovokedly they are not known to attack man; on the contrary, when met in the jungle they attempt to escape. When trod upon or struck, their rage is instantly excited; in self-defence they will even turn from their retreat, and then their habitual sluggishness is roused to furious activity. Preparing to attack, the head is by a short curve of the neck brought closely to the body, and drawn far backwards, when suddenly darting the anterior part of the body obliquely upwards, they bite. The height of the place where the wound is inflicted of course depends on the length of the serpent, which is capable of darting nearly the anterior half of the body. Notwithstanding the circular pupil, they appear to shun the light, hiding the head under the folds of the body, and they are singularly uncertain in their movements, often suddenly jerking the head or tail without any apparent object. Like all serpents of tropical Asia, they seldom expose themselves to the sun; when during the day they leave their hiding-places, they select the shade. The genus *Bungarus* is terrestrial, feeding on rats, mice, serpents (*Col. mucosus*, Lin.), and toads. Like other venomous serpents, when the venom has been inflicted on their prey, they disengage it from the fangs, sheathe and place them as horizontally as possible, in order that they may offer no resistance to the introduction into the mouth of the lifeless prey, which is now seized head foremost. The innocuous serpents bite or strangle their prey, which when life is extinct is either swallowed at once, or if it happens to have been killed in a position likely to render the deglutition difficult, is often disengaged from between the teeth and seized a second time by the head. In captivity these serpents refuse food, but greedily lap up and swallow water.\n\nA fowl, four minutes after it had been bitten on the inner side of the thigh by a *Bungarus fasciatus*, fell on the wounded side, and was shortly after seized with slight purging. The eyes were half closed, the pupils alternately dilated and contracted, immobile. In seventeen minutes slight spasms occurred, under which the bird expired forty-three minutes after it had been wounded.\n\nAnother fowl, wounded in the same place as the former by the same serpent, but after an interval of seven hours, expired under\nsimilar symptoms, only more violent spasms, in the course of twenty-eight minutes.\n\nVenom taken from another serpent, the fangs of which had been extracted, was inoculated by a lancet incision in the right thigh; four minutes after, the fowl was seized with trembling, fell, and remained lying on the wounded side, with the eyes closed, but it gradually recovered, and rose, apparently recovered, thirty minutes after the inoculation of the venom.\n\nOther fowls were killed by different serpents of this species, in twenty to thirty-one minutes.\n\nFowls bitten by *Bungarus candidus* expired under similar symptoms within thirty to forty-five minutes; dogs from within one hour ten minutes to two hours, under symptoms noted in Russell's experiments (Russell, i. p. 53).\n\n**Sub-Fam.

Both are local, and they appear respectively to congregate on single spots of limited extent. Another black variety (Naja atra, Cantor), which inhabits Chusan, differs from the present in having a number of distant transversal double lines of a yellow colour. Beneath, it is slate or pearl coloured.\n\nThe food of Naja lutescens consists of rats, small birds (it occasionally ascends trees), lizards, and fishes, in search of which latter it frequently takes the water, and even the sea, along the coasts. The largest individual of the two Malayan varieties was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . o feet 1\\(\\frac{7}{8}\\) inch.\n\" trunk . . . 4 \", \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)\n\" tail . . . o \", 9 inches.\n\\[\\text{Total} = 4 \", 11\\(\\frac{7}{8}\\)\\]\n\nCircumference of the neck 2\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\), of the trunk 4\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\), of the root of the tail 2\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) inches.\n\nThe following memorandum relative to the venom of Naja\nIutescens, Laurenti, has kindly been communicated by J. W. Laidlay, Esq., joint-secretary, Asiatic Society:\n\n\"The venom was carefully obtained, so as to avoid any admixture of saliva, by compressing the venomous glands. It issued from the lower aperture of the fangs in viscid drops of a syrupy consistency, and was received as it fell from the fangs in platina capsules. The serpents operated upon were an adult Cobra di Capello (Naja iutescens), Laurenti, and one of its varieties (Naja kaouthia, apud Belanger), and were supplied by the kindness of J. W. Grant, Esq., C.S.\n\n\"In every instance the venom readily changed the blue of litmus to red, and restored the bright yellow to turmeric paper that had been reddened by the application of caustic alkali; an unequivocal proof of acidity. When left to spontaneous evaporation, it dried into a varnish resembling mucilage or the glair of an egg, cracking in all directions; and on being heated it deposited an abundant coagulum, apparently albuminous. In either instance when redissolved it retained its acid property.\n\n\"What the nature of this acid may be it was impossible to determine from the small quantity operated upon; nor am I prepared to say that the poison itself is an acid, although if it be not so, it is certainly associated with one. Most probably, from the rapid and spontaneous disappearance of its properties by keeping, the poison itself consists of some exceedingly unstable compound, which would be wholly disorganized under any attempt at isolation by chemical means.\"\n\nSub-Fam.

In Bengal I never observed but a single young one (*T. erythrus*), captured in the Sunderbuns. It is generally observed on trees, hanging down from the branches or concealed under the dense foliage; it preys on small birds and tree-frogs *Polypedates leucomystax*, Gravenhorst; but occasionally it descends to the ground in search of frogs and toads. The neck is covered by twenty-seven, the trunk by twenty-three or twenty-five ovate imbricate keeled scales.

Both are equally dreaded. The natives of Sumatra denominate it \"P\u00fachuk,\" a young, green shoot of a tree, a name expressive both of its colour and arboreal habits. The Malays of the Peninsula, who only know the black variety, call it, from its broad cordate head, the \"hatchet-shaped\" serpent; \"K\u00e1pak,\" or \"K\u00e1pah,\" signifying an axe. At Pinang it generally occupies the lower parts of the hills or the valleys, either on the ground or on trees; but Dr. Montgomerie in one instance observed it at an elevation of 2,200 feet. It preys upon rats, small birds, tree-frogs, and toads. The neck is covered by twenty-seven, the trunk by twenty-three to twenty-five longitudinal series of ovate, imbricate keeled scales. The labials and the gular scales are sharply keeled, but the keels of the former become obliterated with age. The tail is prehensile.\n\nOf nine examined, the largest individual was of the following dimensions:\n\n* Syn.\u2014Seba, ii. t. lxviii. fig. 4; *Coluber sumatranus*, Raffles, Ular Poochook; *Cobrias Wagleri*, H.

The oval gular scales have a tubercular appearance. The integuments of the head and body are remarkably lax, like those of *Acrochordus javanicus*. The neck is covered by thirty-one, the trunk by twenty-seven longitudinal series of ovate or conical scales; they are not imbricate, but are frequently surrounded by the naked skin. The tail is prehensile, but less so than in the preceding species. The Malayan individuals appear to be less numerous than the Javanese.\n\n* As several serpents have by Klein been indicated under the name of *Acontias*, the specific name of Reinwardt has been substituted.\nThe four observed were all found on the ground in valleys. The largest, which had been feeding on a rat, was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . 0 feet 1\\(\\frac{4}{8}\\) inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . 2 \" 5\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . 0 \" 5\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) \"\n\nCircumference of the neck 2, of the trunk 3\\(\\frac{4}{8}\\), of the root of the tail 1\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) inch.\n\nIn general sluggish, but when roused, ferocious habits, the preceding three species resemble the genus *Bungarus*; their mode of attack is also similar: like *Vipera Russellii* (Shaw),* when it prepares to dart they vibrate the prehensile tail and utter a faint hissing sound. As the pupil is vertically contracted by the light, they frequently miss their aim, and like *Bungarus*, *Naja*, *Vipera Russellii*, and *Hydrus*, in the extreme of fury they will fix the fangs in their own bodies. Although they are averse to motion, they are not of quite so stationary habits as represented by M. Schlegel (Essay, \u201cPartie D\u00e9scriptive,\u201d p. 520). In the jungle I have noticed them moving between the branches of trees or on the ground, either in search of prey, or after heavy rains have flooded their hiding-places. In Bengal most terrestrial serpents keep the latter during the hot season, but the rains send them abroad in search of dry localities. Although the present genus has venomous organs as highly developed as *Crotalus* or *Vipera*, the effects produced by wounds, of two species at least, appear to be less dangerous than might *\u00e0 priori* be supposed. According to Russell\u2019s experiments with the venom of *Trigonocephalus gramineus*, chickens expired within eight to thirty-three minutes, pigeons in fourteen to eighteen minutes. A pig recovered in six or seven hours, a dog in two to three hours, after having been wounded (Russell, i. p. 60). Mr. Hodgson has seen a man who was wounded by this species, the only venomous known to inhabit Nepal, fearfully suffering from pain and swelling, but he never heard of a fatal case (\u201cTransactions Zoological Society, London,\u201d vol. ii. p. 309).\n\nA male *Trigonocephalus punicus* successively wounded two fowls, one in the chest, the other in the left thigh. In both cases the fangs of both sides acted, but neither of the birds experienced any other effect except a slight pain, which lasted a few minutes after they had been wounded. It should, however, be observed that the serpent at the time had gorged itself with food, in which state it was observed close to the General Hospital, in the valley\n\n---\n\n*Syn.\u2014Russell, i. pl. vii.; Katuka Rokula Poda, ii. pl. xxxii.; Coluber Russellii, Shaw; Vipera elegans, Daudin.*\n\nVOL. II.\nof Pinang. Another individual was subsequently caused to wound a fowl on the inside of the thigh. The bird immediately drew up the wounded leg, fell down, and was purged three minutes after being wounded. In three minutes more slight spasms of the head and neck appeared at short intervals, but they ceased in five minutes, when the fowl made at first some unsuccessful attempts to rise. Twenty-one minutes after having been wounded the bird rose, shook the wings, and had perfectly recovered. The same serpent subsequently was made to wound another fowl on the inside of the left thigh. The bird drew up the wounded leg and was slightly purged, but showed no other inconvenience from the wound.\n\nThe following experiment is communicated by Dr. Montgomerie. An adult *Trigonocephalus sumatranus*, var., was made to bite a fowl in the fleshy part of the thigh. The bird limped about for a short time, and a minute after it was wounded commenced purging. At the end of two minutes it fell, breathing laboriously, and was strongly convulsed. At the end of six minutes a few drops of water exuded from the eyes; in fifteen seconds more it was quite dead: six minutes and a quarter after it had been wounded. Both fangs had acted; the wound was livid, and similar lines were observed in the course of the absorbents. On another occasion, after some unsuccessful attempts to make another individual bite a fowl, a terrier accidentally was wounded in the fleshy part of the fore-arm. The serpent fixed the fangs for an instant in the flesh; the dog, pitifully screaming, jumped, and shook it off. A ligature was immediately applied above the elbow, and the dog secured in a cage. It continued for some time whining from pain, probably aggravated by the tight ligature, which was removed at the close of half an hour, and the dog let free. In a short time it had regained the free use of the limb and was apparently well; but on the third day following a perfectly circular slough, including the bitten spot, of about $\\frac{3}{4}$ of an inch in diameter, was thrown off; the sore readily healed up, and the dog suffered no further inconvenience.\n\n**PELAGIC.**\n\n**Fam.

The anterior frontals are separated by a small elongated pentagonal or rhombic shield, bordered behind by the vertical, which is proportionally the largest shield, either equalling or exceeding each of the occipitals. The eyes are comparatively large and prominent, surrounded by two post-orbitals, one preorbital, and beneath by the third and fourth of the seven large upper labials. The lower jaw is covered in front by the rostral and the two first labials; the succeeding seven are elongated linear, and placed horizontally so as to be hid by the upper labials, when the mouth is closed. The chin is covered by two pairs of pentagonal shields, between which and the labials appear two or three series of elongated scales. The neck is covered by twenty-five, the anterior part of the trunk by twenty-three, increasing to twenty-five, and again decreasing to nineteen longitudinal series of large smooth scales. The nostrils are\nsmall, opening laterally. The tail, though much compressed, presents a broad flat surface beneath, till near the apex, where it becomes two-edged.

The difference of colours is unimportant, as it is liable to variations, not only individually, but according to age. Besides, all the species acquire a light bluish appearance about the period when the integuments are to be changed. Russell's description was copied by Daudin, who merely supplied the denomination of Hydrophis cyanocinctus (Hydrus Bruyninsii, Boie, 1827), upon which Wagler founded his genus Enhydris, 1830. According to M. Schlegel, all these are synonymes of Hydrus nigrocinctus, Daudin. The only means of deciding the synonymy of this and most of the other species appears to be a close examination of such original specimens, described by Russell and Shaw, which may at present exist in the collection of the British Museum.\nThe eyes are lateral, sunk, excessively small, of a diameter equalling the large, almost vertically opening nostrils. The single preorbital shield is beneath wedged in between the second and third upper labial. The latter, as well as the fourth and fifth, border the orbit beneath. Of the two postorbitals the lower is wedged in between the fifth upper labial and the large shield resting upon the sixth upper labial. Above the latter and the seventh the cheeks are covered by three very large shields. The seven upper labials are large and very high. Of the nine inferior labials the two anterior are the largest, and placed vertically; the succeeding seven are smaller, and placed nearly horizontally, so as to become partially hid when the jaws are closed. The chin is covered by the first pair of labials and two pairs of elongated mentals, between which and the inferior labials intervene on each side the second labial, three very large shields and three smaller.\n\nThe neck is covered by thirty-seven, the anterior part of the trunk by thirty-three, and the thickest by forty longitudinal series of rhombic scales. In the individuals examined by M. Schlegel, all of less length than my own, the series varied from thirty-one, twenty-nine, to twenty-seven. The scales are rhombic with rounded apex, each scale with a small central tubercle, or an elevated (keeled) line, which, however, with age becomes indistinct or obliterated. The central larger abdominal scales are hexagonal, with or without a small tubercle on each side. The anus is covered by three or four excessively large scales.

The orbit is bordered beneath almost entirely by the fourth upper labial. The sixth upper labial is the largest, in some individuals covering the cheek and bordering above the occipital. Of the seven or eight inferior labials, the four anterior are very large; above the third there is one or two small triangular shields; the other three or four posterior labials are very small, elongated. There is no horizontal series of labials as in *H. striatus*, and the two elongated pairs of mentals immediately border the labials. The neck is covered by thirty-three, the thickest part of the trunk by fifty-three longitudinal series of scales. Those examined by M. Schlegel, the length of which exceeds those come under my own observation, had twenty-seven, twenty-nine, to thirty-one series of scales. Those of the anterior part of the back are rhomboidal, those of the posterior part rhombic with rounded apex, and slightly imbricate; those of the sides hexagonal, all have either a sharply raised keel or a central tubercle, both of which frequently become obliterated. The central series of abdominal scales are a little larger than the rest, frequently divided in two hexagonal, and with a small tubercle on each side, which often becomes indistinct or obliterated. The anus is covered by three or four very large, or by a series of small scales. The largest of six individuals was of the following dimensions:\n\n| Length of the head | 0 feet 0\\(\\frac{6}{8}\\) inch. |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------|\n| \" trunk           | 2\\(\\frac{0}{8}\\)\"                |\n| \" tail            | 0\\(\\frac{2}{8}\\)\"                |\n\nCircumference of the neck \\(6\\), greatest do. of the trunk 2 inches.\nVar.?\n\nCrown shields olive green with a blackish band from the eyes over the anterior part of the upper lip; the posterior part and the lower lip pale yellow; ground colour of the trunk greenish lead-grey above, pale yellow on the sides, beneath buff, with numerous black transversal bands. Iris amber-coloured, with the orbital margin dark grey. Central abdominal series of scales, $235 + 38$.\n\nIt differs from the preceding in the following particulars:\u2014The head is proportionally shorter, broader, triangular, the muzzle more pointed, and the upper surface from the vertical shield very declivous. The eyes are much larger than the nostrils, with a single pre- and post-orbital, but bordered beneath by the third and fourth upper labial. The latter, six in number, present nothing abnormal. The lower labials are also six, proportionally larger than in the preceding. The mouth is smaller. The make of the trunk is more robust; the neck is covered by fifteen, the thickest part of the body by twenty-one longitudinal series of proportionally much broader hexagonal scales, tuberculated on the anterior part of the trunk, on the rest keeled, forming series of sharp, continued ridges. The central abdominal series is at first somewhat larger than the rest, angular, with a small more or less distinct tubercle on each side.

Yet it may be readily distinguished from that and other species by the excessive slenderness of the anterior, cylindrical part of the trunk, which from thence becomes much compressed, gradually increasing in bulk and vertical diameter till towards the tail, where the diameter again decreases. The scales of the cylindrical anterior part of the trunk are rhomboidal with rounded points and slightly imbricate; the rest are hexagonal. The central abdominal series continued beneath the tail consists of hexagonal scales, a little larger than the rest, and frequently longitudinally divided. In the very young all the scales are smooth; with age the central abdominal ones acquire a small tubercle on each side, and those of the compressed sides and of the back each a central tubercle. In the largest individuals the central abdominal scales have three longitudinally placed minute tubercles on each side, and the rest of the hexagonal scales three or four similar central tubercles. In the new-born the neck is covered by thirty-two, the bulkiest part\nof the body by forty-nine longitudinal series; these parts are covered by twenty-six and forty-four series in the largest individual, which is of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . 0 feet 0\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . 3 \" 2\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . 0 \" 4 \"\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n3 \" 7\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\)\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nCircumference of the neck \\(1\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\)\\), of greatest do. of the trunk \\(3\\(\\frac{6}{8}\\)\\) inches.\n\n**Hydrus schistosus**, Daudin.\n\n**Syn.**\u2014Russell, ii. pl. x.

Behind the latter the lip is covered by three or four horizontally placed small shields, above which appear three large vertically placed shields, of which the last borders the sides of the occipital pair. The lower rostral is remarkably elongated, linear, and hid in a furrow between the first pair of inferior labials. Of the latter the anterior five on each side are much elongated, followed by five or six smaller. The chin is covered with numerous minute scales, and, like the rest of the body, with very lax skin. In the young ones the neck is covered by forty-seven, the bulkiest part of the body by fifty-seven longitudinal series of smooth, somewhat tubercular scales. Older individuals have these parts covered by forty-eight and sixty series of hexagonal scales, either with a short keel dividing the anterior half, or a central tubercle. The central slightly raised abdominal series commences very far back, from one to three inches behind the chin. The anterior scales are wedge-shaped hexagonal, the posterior are broader but slightly larger than the rest, with a small elongated tubercle on each side.

The eyes are moderate, lateral, not prominent, surrounded by a preorbital, a postorbital, and beneath by the third and fourth upper labials. The frenal shield, observed by M. Schlegel, was not present in four individuals examined in the Straits of Malacca; its existence therefore appears not to be constant; in all *Hydri* the shields of the head are liable to considerable individual variations of form. Of the eight upper labials the posterior three are very small, which is also the case with the posterior five of the nine inferior labials. The two pairs of elongated mentals are outside bordered by the three first inferior labials; inside, by several small scales. In the young the neck is covered by thirty-seven, the thickest part of the trunk by forty longitudinal series of hexagonal, smooth, comparatively small scales. In the older individual these parts are covered by thirty-two and thirty-seven large hexagonal scales, each with a central tubercle. The lower series of the sides are slightly larger than the rest, and vertically elongated, so as to require a rectangular appearance. The central abdominal series is much smaller than the rest. Each scale is either rhombic, and, as represented in the excellent plates of \"Fauna Japonica,\" hemmed in between four* of the two lowest lateral series, or they are absent, and their place is occupied by a pair of the former, which are soldered together. In the young individuals the central series frequently consists of alternate broad triangular and very minute rectangular scales, both kinds smaller than the rest.

The eye is larger than in any other species of *Hydrus*, surrounded by two, three, or even four postorbitals, one large preorbital, and beneath, by the fourth upper labial shield. A frenal shield has been observed in some individuals, but it was absent in that examined in the Straits of Malacca, nor does it exist in the specimens in the Museum of the Asiatic Society.\n\n* In consequence of the specific name of Linn\u00e9 having been applied by Latreille to a genus (Platurus), that of Schneider, the next different in succession, has been substituted.\n\n\u2020 In the individual figured by Russell the bright yellow colour formed a narrow lateral line, below which the sides and abdomen were of a dusky greenish-yellow.\nThe neck is covered by forty-four, the thickest part of the trunk by fifty-two longitudinal series of small scales. Those of the upper parts are smooth, hexagonal; those of the sides approach the orbicular form, and have in the centre one, two, or three longitudinally placed minute tubercles. Similar tubercles are observed on each side of the scales, forming the central abdominal series, which is composed either of entire hexagonal scales, a little larger than the rest, or they are longitudinally divided into pairs of smaller pentagonal scales, which have the appearance of being divided by an abdominal suture. A single individual, taken in a fishing stake off the coast of Province Wellesley, was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . . 0 feet 1\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) inch.\n\" \" trunk : : : : : 2 \" 1\\(\\frac{7}{8}\\) \"\n\" \" tail : : : : : 0 \" 3\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) inches.\n\n2 \" 7\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) \"\n\nCircumference of the neck 2\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\), greatest circumference of the trunk 3\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) inches.\n\nThe preceding, comprising all the hitherto known species of Pelagic serpents, were observed chiefly at Pinang among the abundant supply of fishes daily carried to the markets. Of their general habits some account appears in the \"Transactions of the Zoological Society, London,\" vol. ii. p. 303. One of them, *Hydrus schistosus*, is incredibly numerous in the Bay of Bengal, at Pinang and Singapore, far more so than any known terrestrial serpent. The fishing-nets are hardly ever worked but one or more are among the contents. The other six species are of rare occurrence at Pinang and Singapore, as will be perceived from the disproportionally small number of each examined during four years\u2014viz., of *Laticauda scutata*, 3; *Hydrus striatus*, 2; *nigrocinctus*, 6; *gracilis*, 7; *pelamidoides*, 4; *pelamis*, 1. Of these, *Laticauda scutata* is excessively numerous in Timor, *Hydrus pelamis* in New Guinea, the Molucca Islands, and Otaheite, where the natives use it as an article of food. The remaining species, as far as is known, have been observed nowhere in such overwhelming numbers. Large individuals of every species are very seldom seen; it is the young individuals which frequent the coasts, and it appears to be questionable if even the largest observed are animals arrived at their full size. The large individuals are very ferocious, the young ones are less so. Fortunately for the fishermen, the light blinds these serpents, which when out of their proper element become very sluggish and soon expire. This accounts for the safety of the class of men whose daily calling brings them in immediate contact with animals the wound of which is fatal. The fisher-\nmen in the Straits of Malacca are aware of their danger, and therefore take care to avoid or destroy these reptiles while landing the fishes. The Malays denominate them *Ular laut*\u2014i.e., serpents of the sea, among which, however, the innocuous *Acrochordus granulatus*, Schneider, is also comprised as an inhabitant of the coasts.\n\n**BATRACHIA.**\n\n**Fam.

Compared with a specimen of *Ichthyophis glutinosus*, Linn\u00e9, the present is of a more robust make, the head is shorter, the muzzle blunter, and the transversal distance between the nostrils greater. The apex of the tongue and the arches formed by the teeth are broader, more rounded. The palatal and upper maxillary teeth are blunter and appear less recurved. Those of the lower jaw, the largest, present an appearance as if each was composed of two distinct parts: a lower, which is vertical, broadly triangular, the posterior margin of which supports the upper part, which is curved backwards and with rounded apex. The circular folds of the skin are fewer, more distant, and, with the exception of the three or four anterior ones, complete. They are disposed in a manner similar to that of *Ichthyophis glutinosus*. The crowded imbricate scales appear to be of a somewhat rectangular form, less rounded than in *I. glutinosus*; in both their surface presents a minute network. The fosset of the upper lip is situated in the centre of a small tubercle. The circumference of the fosset is provided with a very short, minute, membranous tube, which, however, after the animal for some years has been preserved in spirits of wine, can scarcely any longer be distinguished.\nLength of the head . . . . . . . . . . . \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) inch.\n\" \" trunk . . . . . . . . . . . \\(1\\frac{1}{8}\\) inches.\n\" \" tail . . . . . . . . . . . \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) inch.\n\n\\[\\text{Total} = 10\\frac{6}{8} \\text{ inches.}\\]\n\nCircumference of the neck 1, of the trunk \\(1\\frac{2}{8}\\), of the root of the tail \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) inch.\n\nA single individual was observed by Dr. Montgomerie at Singapore in 1843, in whose garden it was turned up with the earth, from about two feet below the surface, and from whom I received the specimen shortly after it had been killed.

Pupil vertically rhomboidal.\n\nHab.\u2014Pinang.\n\nWagler\u2019s short description of M. montana is drawn up from a preserved specimen, which apparently is also the case with that communicated in \u201cErp\u00e9tologie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\u201d From the latter the present animal differs both in colours and in the following particulars. The muzzle forms a pointed lobe resembling the upper eyelids, but smaller. The nostrils are transversely oval, protected by a membranous valve fixed to their lower margin. The upper eyelids are perfectly smooth. The nearly vertical cheeks are above bordered by an angular ridge terminating near the shoulder; behind by a short curved ridge, which at the angle of the mouth forms a small pointed lobe. The back is smooth without transversal folds, but bordered on each side by a sharp whitish ridge commencing at the upper eyelid, converging towards the cloacal orifice. On the shoulder, near the triangular tubercle, the ridge is enclosed between two short black lines.\n\nTwo males were at different times captured on the Pentland Hills, at an elevation of about 1,800 feet. One was found in a dark room, where it was observed remaining motionless during several successive days. Its forms and colours caused it at first to be mistaken for a withered leaf. The second was taken on a tree. The iris is vertically contracted by exposure to the light. The male has no vocal sacs.

Hyl\u00e6dactylus, Tschudi.\n\nTongue an oval disk, thick, free only at the lateral margins. Palatal teeth. Eustachian tubes very minute. No parotids. Four free fingers with the terminal joint widened, truncated. Five toes united at the base by a very small membrane, the terminal joint not widened; sole with two soft tubercles between tarsus and metatarsus. Sacral transversal processes forming triangular palettes.\n\nHyl\u00e6dactylus divittatus, N.S.\n\nUpper parts and outside of extremities brownish-olive with distant small black spots. Head from the muzzle to the middle of the orbit whitish. A broad whitish band edged with black from the posterior angle of the eye, along each side to the loins. A shorter, oblique, similar band from the posterior angle of the eye. Beneath whitish, vermiculated with brown. The throat of the males black. Iris golden brown; pupil transversally rhombic.\n\nHab.\u2014Malayan Peninsula.\n\nFrom H. baleatus, Tschudi, the present species differs both in colours and in the following particulars:\u2014The profile from the nose to the coccyx forms a considerable arch, the highest part of which is the centre of the back. The male is provided with a vocal sac, the large openings of which are situated on each side of the tongue, and their presence is easily detected by the laxity of the (black) skin of the throat, which forms a broad transversal fold. Between the small openings of the Eustachian tubes the palate presents a considerable transversal fold of the skin, the free margin of which is fringed, which gives it the appearance of a row of teeth. A similar fold has been observed by MM. Dum\u00e9ril and Bibron in the genera Plectropus, Dum. and Bibr., and in Uperodon, Dum. and Bibr. In front of this fold is another smaller, between the orbital protuberances. Behind each of the large internal openings of the nostrils is an arched bony ridge, which in H. baleatus supports a few teeth. In the only individual of the present species examined the free margin of the ridge is cutting, but without teeth. Over\nthe symphysis of the lower jaw there is a small pointed process, fitting into a corresponding cavity in the margin of the upper jaw. In this species, no less than in *Uperodon marmoratum*, Dum. and Bibr., nearly the whole of the thigh is hidden by the skin of the body, so that the posterior extremities are free but from a little above the knees. This character does not appear to exist in *Hylocactylus baleatus*, as it is not mentioned in the description of that species by MM. Dum\u00e9ril and Bibron. On the anterior part of the back appear some indistinct rounded elevations; the rest of the upper parts is smooth. The skin of the throat and abdomen presents numerous transversal wrinkles, and is covered with minute tubercles. The toes are more slender than the fingers, and their last joint, although flattened, is not so broad as that of the fingers, which is of a somewhat triangular form, truncated in front. In *H. baleatus* the fingers are longer than the toes. In the present species, however, the longest finger, the third, is nearly one-fourth shorter than the fourth toe.\n\nThe only individual which I had an opportunity of examining, after its death, was a male taken in a field near Malacca. It was of the following dimensions:\n\nLength of the head . . . . . . 0\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) inch.\nIn a straight line from the muzzle to coccyx, following the arch of the back 2\\(\\frac{6}{8}\\) inches.\nLength of the anterior extremities . . 1\\(\\frac{9}{8}\\) inch.\n\", posterior extremities, following the posterior margin . . 2\\(\\frac{7}{8}\\) inches.\n\nI have to acknowledge my sense of obligation to the Hon. Sir William Norris, late Recorder of H.M. Court of Judicature in the Straits of Malacca; to W. T. Lewis, Esq., Asst. Res. Councillor, Prince of Wales Island; to W. Montgomery, Esq., M.D., late Senior Surgeon, Straits of Malacca; and to Capt. Congalton, H.C., steamer *Hoogly*, for their assistance, to me so much more acceptable as the limited leisure left me by the superintendence of six hospitals in Prince of Wales Island, and a seventh in Province Wellesley, was latterly curtailed by additional extra professional duties imposed upon me by the present local head authority in the Straits.\n\nFort William, June 1st, 1847.\nCATALOGUE OF REPTILES INHABITING\n\nLATITUDINAL DISTRIBUTION OF REPTILES\n\nInhabiting the Malayan Peninsula and Islands and other localities.\n\n[Sp. prefixed to localities signifies that they are inhabited by species of which varieties occur in Malayan countries.]\n\nCHELONIA.\n\n1.

Zoological information has hitherto been confined almost exclusively to the plains of the western part. The productions of the chain of mountains dividing the peninsula, and terminating in Cape Romania in 1\u00b0 17' N.L. (Point B\u00farus in 1\u00b0 15' N.L.) are almost entirely unknown. The late Mr. Griffith, on a visit in the early part of 1842 to Mount Ophir (G\u00fanong L\u00e9dang, in about 2\u00b0 30' N. L. on the eastern boundary of the district of Malacca, granite, and computed about 4,000 feet), made the interesting discovery, that from 1,500 feet and upwards the vegetation changes completely, and in many respects assumes a Polynesian or Australian character. Early in 1847 Lieutenant-Colonel James Low visited Keddah Peak (G\u00fanong Jerai), opposite to the town of Keddah, in about 6\u00b0 5' N.L., which he observes is not granite but stratified, abounding in minerals. According to observation of the boiling point of water, the summit, a small platform on the edge of the strata, is 5,705 feet above the sea. Towards the summit the vegetation becomes very stunted, and partakes of Australian character.* Colonel Low further observes that during the ascent he did not see a single animal, but found footprints of a rhinoceros, smaller than usual, he supposes up to the very summit. To a casual visitor of the Malayan hill forest during the day, the paucity of animals is a striking feature. The noonday light, subdued by the dense foliage of the towering stems, gives to the scene a sombre character, heightened by the unseen denizens. Their presence is manifested in the shrill vibrations of Cicadae (one of which on the Pinang hills is noted for its resemblance to the cavalry trumpet), the call of the Tupai, the dismal tap of the gigantic woodpecker, the creaking flight of a Buceros, or the retreat of a frightened Semnopithecus.\n\nCHELONIA.\n\nGeomyda spinosa, Gray.

CANTOR.\n\nBy the late W. Griffith, Esq., F.L.S., Memb. Imp. Acad. Natur. Curios., Royal Ratisb. Botan. Soc., Corr. Memb. Hort. Soc., Royal Acad. Turin, Assist. Surgeon, Madras Establishment.\n\n[\u201cJournal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,\u201d vol. xxiii. pp. 623-650.]\n\n[Note.\u2014The following paper has been printed for several years, and was intended to form part of an interesting communication by Dr. Cantor on the Natural History of Chusan, which was to lead off vol. xxi. of the \u201cAsiatic Researches.\u201d This publication having been, for the present at all events, discontinued, Dr. Griffith\u2019s valuable Memoir on Chusan Botany has been reprinted.\u2014Ed.].\n\nThis collection consists of plants from the Straits of Malacca, from Lantao, Chusan, and a few from Pekin, the bulk of the Chinese plants being from Chusan. The Straits specimens were, I believe, given to Dr. Cantor by the Rev. Mr. White, Chaplain of Singapore.\n\nThe following lists exhibit the genera and the number of species procured from the above-mentioned localities, the names of a few species being added:\u2014\n## STRAITS OF MALACCA.\n\n### ACOTYLEDONES.\n\n| Family          | Genus         | Species |\n|-----------------|---------------|---------|\n| Lycopodineae    | Lycopodium    | 3       |\n|                 | Lygodium      | 1       |\n|                 | Gleichenia    | 2       |\n|                 | Polypodium    | 3       |\n| Filices         | Aspidium      | 1       |\n|                 | Asplenium     | 1       |\n|                 | Blechnum      | 1       |\n|                 | Pteris        | 1       |\n| **Total**       |               | **13**  |\n\n### DICOTYLEDONES.\n\n#### INCOMPLETE.\n\n| Family          | Genus                  | Species |\n|-----------------|------------------------|---------|\n| Taxineae?

A description and drawing of this plant, first met with by K\u00f6nig in 1779, is now in the possession of the Linnean Society.\n\nTERNSTR\u00c6MIAE\u00c6?\u2014I refer with some doubt to this family Ixonanthes of Jack. This genus, hitherto only known from Jack's description, has been placed doubtfully among Cedrelaceae by Dr. Lindley and M. Endlicher, with which, however, its resemblances appear to be rather technical. A more proper place is, I think, to be found between Ternstr\u00e6miace\u00e6 and Hypericin\u00e6, the major part of the affinities being with the former family.\n\nIXONANTHES.\u2014Jack, Mal. Misc.

Wight and Arnott under the name Cambessedea, for which, from its being pre-occupied, Meisner has substituted Boueia. But no sign or mark is appended to indicate who were the original proposers of the genus, with whom the merit must in most cases necessarily rest. It is one thing to glance over a complete catalogue of names and ascertain which is pre-occupied, another to detect and define a new group. Botanists have admitted certain conventional signs, which have been generally adopted, and would do well to admit signs of a most conspicuous character by which the compiler may be known from the designer; the botanist who names after examination and comparison, from him who names without having done either. Or as suggested in the excellent rules for reforming Zoologic Nomenclature, p. 8, par. 4, now that communication is so rapid, it might be courteously left to the framer of the genus to correct the error.\n\n**\"Endl.

The genus is remarkable for its placentation, which is the only instance I am acquainted with of the co-existence of thoroughly parietal placentation with perfect dis-\n\n* The opposition of the leaves being characteristic of the genus, it becomes necessary to change Roxburgh's name.\nsepiments, independently of any apparent production inwards of any parts of the placental surface. Hypothetically this is explainable by assuming the ovula to be confined to that part of the carpellary leaf with which almost invariably they have no manner of connection. In other words, they may be declared to arise from the back of the carpel leaf, or from the midrib, and the space on either side between it and the inflected margins.*\n\nAppearances, derived from the examination of Pternandra ccerulescens, are not perhaps altogether unfavourable to the supposition that there is a disturbance in the direction of the carpel leaves analogous to that which affects some, perhaps most, Boragineae, by which the true apex of each carpellum is brought close to the base, and in which, as appears to me, suggested by the situation of the raphe, the placenta has a disposition to be dorsal; so that if a polysporous placenta be found to exist in a carpellum so constituted, it may, I am inclined to conjecture, be as dorsal as it is in Pternandra.\n\nFrom the evidence afforded by this genus, it would appear that an \"ovarium inferum\" may have part of its cavities, or even of its placentae, actually superior; that is, above the line drawn when the term \"ovarium inferum\" is made use of, which term, nevertheless, is perhaps quite as admissible in many instances as that of ovarium adhaerens.\n\nMyrtaceae.\u2014I refer without doubt to Tristania, one of Mr. White's plants. It is the fourth Indian species of the genus I have met with, the northerly limit of which, so far as yet known, appears to be Moulmein, 17\u00b0 N.L. This is a fact of some interest, as Mr. Bennett\u2020 states that he is only acquainted with one species found beyond the limits of N. Holland. In connection with this I may mention Stylidium, which is perhaps the last Australian form that disappears, an instance of the genus having been found by Dr. Voigt about Serampore, and by Lieut. Kittoe at Midnapore. This genus also occurs at Mergui and Moulmein, but has not hitherto been remarked on the Khassya Hills or in Assam. Another Australian form, Melaleuca leucadendron, forms, from its abundance in the low littoral tracts of Malacca, a very marked feature of vegetation. The northerly limit of this species is Mergui (12\u00b0 N.L.), where it occurs in similar localities, but comparatively limited in size and numerical extent.\n\n* Most of the instances hitherto cited as exhibiting dorsal placentation, appear to me to be untenable, and naturally explicable. But it is certain that Monocotyledonous monstrosities do occur, in which the buds arise from the inner surface of the leaves to the exclusion of the usually gemmiferous margins. Of this I met with a marked instance in a Liliaceous plant in Eastern Afghanistan.\n\n\u2020 \"Pl. Jav. Rar.\" Pt.

Rar.\" p. 127. t. 27.\n\nThe fourth species was met with sparingly in fruit on Mount Ophir; in the form of its leaves it approaches to T. obovata, but the fruit is rounder. The peduncles appear much less branched than in any of the other extra-Australian species, but the degree of adhesion between the calyx and pericarpium is the same. It was observed with Baeckea frutescens, three species of Leptospermum, and one of Leucopogon.*\n\n* The Mount Ophir species of this genus, which is not uncommon at Paldam Bhattoo, differs from that found on the littoral tracts of Malacca in the narrow leaves crowded on short branches, the corolla scarcely parted to the middle,\nI know so little of the Australian species of this genus and family that I am unable to state what value should be attached to the placentation in these four extra-Australian species, to the abortion and deformity of most of the seeds, the wing of the fertile one, and the embryo. The habit and especially geographic distribution would seem to point to some degree of separation. It is to be remembered, however, that Mr. Bennett in the \"Pl. Jav. Rar.,\" a work of the highest authority, does not remark on any structural peculiarity presented by Tristania obovata, his specimens of which, excepting the absence of ripe seeds, appear to have been complete.\n\n**Rubiaceae.**\u2014I notice Epithinia mayana, to confirm Messrs. Wight and Arnott's statement, that it has stipulae. The opposite statement, in the Malayan Miscellanies, I have ascertained was corrected* by Dr. Jack himself in a copy found thrown aside among some loose papers in the Botanic Gardens. There are at the Botanic Gardens some other MS. corrections which might have been advantageously inserted in the reprint of his writings, undertaken by Sir W. Hooker at the suggestion, I believe, of Dr. Wallich.\u2020\n\nThe disposition of the placentae and ovula in this genus is curious. The former, or perhaps rather their ovuliferous portions, are confined to the middle of the inner angle of each cell, from which they are produced outwards into the middle. Each bears on its apex two ovula, the upper one of which is erect, the under pendulous; the raphe of both being on that side of the ovulum next the outer wall of the cell. The result, when both ovula are matured, is, that two anatropous seeds, of which one is erect and one pendulous, have the radicles of their embryos pointing exactly towards one another.\n\n**CANTON COLLECTION.**\n\nThis is entirely tropical, and the only peculiar forms that appear to me to exist in it are Nauclea Adina, Strophanthus dichotomus, and Siphonostegia sinensis. For Breckia frutescens is found on Mount Ophir, with some other Australasian or Polynesian forms, and Myrtus tomentosa is to be found in abundance in the Straits.\n\nthe large hypogynous scales which nearly enclose the ovarium, and the smooth filiform style. For this the name L. ophirensis may be proposed.\n\nIndeed it was improbable that an exclusively littoral plant should make its appearance suddenly on an isolated mountain, at an elevation of 2,000 feet anywhere, much more so on Mount Ophir, the productions of which from Padham Bhatto upwards are very dissimilar from general Malacca vegetation, approaching much more to that characteristic of Polynesia and Australia.\n\n* Instead of \"Stipules none,\" it is, \"stipules short, interpetiolar.\"\n\n\u2020 Are there any other MSS. of Jack in existence? I find references in Dr. Wallich's handwriting to a MS. description of Hoya grandiflora, in an imperfect copy of Carey's edition of Roxburgh's \"Flora Indica.\"\nof Malacca. But Siphonostegia, the specimens of which present additional calycine lobes, is the only local or characteristic form, for Nauclea is not only a common Indian genus, but there is, I believe, a Khasiya form that approaches N. Adina itself, and Strophanthus exists on the N.E. frontier of Bengal, and about Malacca, where it is represented by a very fine species with large horn-like follicles. All the remaining genera, and probably almost all the species, may be met with either on the Tenasserim Coast or on the eastern frontier of Bengal.\n\nCHUSAN COLLECTION.\n\nThe list of this collection given at the commencement is not limited to plants actually existing in the collection, but includes a few others, either contained in Dr. Cantor's sketches, or in his conspectus of his collections.* I have attached an asterisk to those forms which seem to me to be extra-tropical, from which it would appear that the great bulk (about five-sixths) is decidedly tropical.\n\nThis collection presents an unusual mixture of form, much of which is perhaps attributable to the effects of cultivation. Almost all the genera are to be met with in \"India Orientalis,\" but I imagine scarcely any other like locality could present such a mixture as that of Commelina, Hydrocharis, Salisburia, Achyranthes, Pinus, Aglaia, Humulus lupulus, P\u00e6deria, Juglans, Zingiber, Agrimonia, Nelumbium, Rhododendron, and a Palm.\n\nThe most marked northern forms appear to me to be Hydrocharis, Salisburia, Pinus, Quercus, Humulus lupulus, Agrimonia, Rhododendron, Solanum dulcamara?\n\nClematis, Rumex, Camellia, Hedera, Sambucus, and Plantago all admit of some degree of explanation, inasmuch as these genera may be found at similar levels, but in considerably lower latitudes, in certain parts of the Eastern frontier of Bengal; and some species of Juniperus under cultivation seem to defy a great amount of heat.\n\nOther similarities to the Flora of our eastern frontier, Assam for instance, are indicated by the affinity of the Quercus to one from the Khasiya Hills, on which it is, so far as I know, the only European form of that genus; by one of the Polygonaceae which also occurs in the same direction, and which is remarkable for its armed habit, perfoliate leaves, and bright azure berries, and by the genus Actinostemma.\n\nThe only parts of this collection which I feel myself at all competent to illustrate are Hamamelide\u00e6 and Cucurbitace\u00e6.\n\n* \"Calc.

For this oversight and empty compliment Dr. Wallich is responsible, as he had Blume's \"Flora Javae\" (in which folio work the family is defined and the genus figured) before him during the printing of my MSS.\n\nThe family Balsaminiflorae (Balsamaceae, Lindl.) appears to be generally considered allied to Platanaceae, Salicaceae, and some of their neighbours. And although the structure of Bucklandia was not detailed before 1836 it still appears to me odd that no indication of the similarity of Liquidambar with Fothergilla had been noticed.\n\nFrom the great variety in structure presented by Hamamelideae, in which family, limited as it is in genera and species, plants occur varying in habit, with hermaphrodite or polygamous flowers, with petals or without petals, with a quaternary or quinary number of parts, with definite or indefinite stamens, with simple or valvular dehiscence of anthers, I am inclined to believe that Balsaminiflorae will be found to be a temporary, or at least a subordinate, group. Its present claims to distinction seem to me limited to the male inflorescence and flowers, which are, so far as I can judge from dried specimens of the Assam species, deficient in any envelope analogous to a perianth or even partial bracte. Its habit presents nothing peculiar; it is not more characteristic of the \"Amental\" order than that of Fothergilla or Corylopsis. Its anthers present no very great peculiarity, particularly if compared with those of Fothergilla, while its female flowers are in many essential points closely allied to those of Bucklandia, in which (and I take this to be of considerable importance) female capitula also occur, and the ovula are considerably increased in number.\n\nsepius opposita; interiora sepiissime per paria petalis opposita, majora, atroviridia, apicibus subglanduliformibus sepe recurvis.

The leaves vary much in size, those on the mere leaf-bearing branches being as large as those of the Minza Pezzea specimens. These again differ from the other Bootan ones in the spikes being less precious, in the length of the styles, and in the longer and pale ferruginous hairyness of the spikes.\n\nThis is the fourth species of this genus, two having been defined and one indicated in the \"Flora Japonica\" (loc. cit.); of the three Japanese species, only one, C.

There does not appear to be any peculiarity in the situation of the cirri, the particular nature of which is besides unknown.\u2020\n\nIt passes I imagine into typical Cucurbitaceae through Zanonia, in which the placentae are so produced inwards as to meet in the axis, and still more through Telfaria (Hook.), in which there appears to be a tendency to the triadelphous stamens, and which is represented as having horizontal and tunicated seeds.\n\nIt affords strong evidence against the hypothesis of the structure of Cucurbitaceous fruit advanced some time ago by Dr. Wight, and which goes so far as to reverse what has hitherto been found to be the constant disposition of the vegetable leaf. For the gradation is complete (through Zanonia)\u2021 between the entirely species. The two, now attempted to be established, require to be examined in the living state.\n\nIn my Mallaca collection occur specimens of a remarkable plant, which appears to me to belong to this sub-family, although its habit is widely different, being rather that of Menispermaceae.\n\nCalyx minutus irregularis, sub 5-partitus.

While the ovula are distinctly parietal, the placentae are produced inwards so as to meet in the axis, resembling in a remarkable degree, the very young state of the placentation of Coccinia.\n\nThe fruit may be thus described.

But the common form of the margin of Cucurbitaceous seeds would seem either to indicate the occurrence of no wing, or if any, of two.

Blyth, Esq.\n\nThe species of Bovine animals (so far as known), whether recent or fossil, resolve into three primary groups:\u2014viz.,\n\nI. Bisontine. II. Taurine. III. Bubaline. Two of these groups being again divisible as follow:\n\nI. Bisontine (adapted for a frigid climate). Subdivided into\u2014\n\n1. Ovibos (the \u201cMusk Ox\u201d of the Arctic \u201cbarren grounds\u201d of America; but which formerly, during the glacial epoch, was far more extensively diffused, remains of this animal having been met with in the British Islands*). 2. Bo\u00f6therium; extinct (founded aliquorum cohesione, placentis intus productis, ovulorum numero, et seminibus marginato-atatis. Z. Vigiliana. Arn. verisimiliter genere excludenda.\n\n* As also of the Caribou, or present barren-ground race or variety of the Reindeer; though I am far from being satisfied that this barren-ground race differs in any respect from the wild Reindeer of Lapland, or of the \u201ctundras\u201d of Arctic Siberia; while I much suspect that the large race or variety of Reindeer which is ridden by the Tungusi and other Siberian tribes (and to the backs of which the bales of goods are annually transferred, in Manchuria, from those of two-humped camels), to be similarly identical with the Woodland Caribou of North America. The subject of the races of Reindeer will be more fully treated of in the sequel.\n\nAs the above is passing through the press, I learn, from Lord Wrottesley\u2019s Address to the British Association at Oxford (June 27th, 1860), that Dr. H. Falconer, \u201caided by Col. Wood, of Glamorganshire, has recently extracted\non two specific races, one of which is the Ovibos Pallantis of De Blainville, and the other is the Bos bombifrons of Harlan). 3. Bison (the well-known broad-fronted and shaggy Bisons of Europe and N. America, and formerly of N. Asia). 4. Poepagus (the Yak of high Central Asia). To this Bisontine division pertain the only indigenous bovine quadrupeds of America.\n\nII. Taurine (with the exception of the humped cattle suited to a temperate climate and restricted to mountainous countries within or near the tropics). Subdivided into\u20141. Zebus (the Zebu or humped cattle of the hotter regions of Asia and Africa). 2. Taurus (the humpless cattle with cylindrical horns). 3. Gavreus (the humpless cattle with flattened horns, peculiar to S.E. Asia).\n\nIII. Bubaline (the flat-horned, thinly clad, and thick-hided wallowing* cattle of Asia and Africa). Comprising only\u20141. Bubalus (the Buffaloes, including the Anoa of Celebes).\n\nAccording to the views so very ably expounded by Mr. C. Darwin, all the species of one genus have a common origin in the depths of time, and we may ascend in the generalization to any extent, needing only unlimited lapse of time for the ever accumulating development of small variations in any particular direction, under the unconscious guidance of the law of Natural Selection. Species, as he maintains, are only strongly marked varieties, and varieties he designates as incipient species; and most assuredly the dividing line between what are variously accepted as species or as varieties cannot oftentimes be traced; nevertheless, it is admitted by Mr. Darwin that the mass of what are generally considered as species have acquired a high degree of persistency, and arguments pro and con are abundantly supplied by the Bovines, as by endless other groups; on the one hand, we have the multitudinous races of cylindrical-horned domestic cattle, whether humped or humpless, which surely no naturalist would go the length of supposing to be so many separate and distinct creations; and, on the other hand, we have the phenomenon of three wild species, or most strongly characterized races (more strongly characterized apart than are any of the domestic races of humped or humpless Taurines respectively), yet exhibiting many peculiarities in common, inhabiting to a great extent the very same region, but maintaining their distinctive characters wherever found, and never (so far as known) hybridizing one with another,\n\nfrom a single cave in the Gower peninsula of South Wales, a vast quantity of the antlers of a Reindeer (perhaps of two species of Reindeer), both allied to the living one. These fossils are most of them shed horns; and there have been already no fewer than 1,100 of them dug out of the mud filling one cave.\"\n\n\u2014Athen\u00e6um, June 30, 1866, p. 890.\n\nIt is remarkable that Ursus arctos of the major continent should, in America, be restricted in its range to the Arctic barren-grounds.\n\n* The true bisons wallow during the summer.\nthough at least two of them have interbred in a state of domestication (and one of them even in the wild state) with the ordinary tame humped cattle of the tropical regions of the major continent.* All three are domesticable, as will be shown; and as regards the reputed indomitable nature of one of them, the gigantic Gaour (G. gaurus), we have only to reflect on the fact, how very readily the tamest and one of the most thoroughly and completely domesticated of all tame creatures, the humped Ox (Bos or Zebus gibbosus) relapses into a condition of feral wildness, unsurpassed even by the Gaour itself, and assuredly beyond that of the renowned Chillingham cattle of Northumberland, if not also of the feral humpless cattle of S. America and elsewhere.\u2020\n\nThe humped cattle are unknown in an aboriginally wild state; and I am strongly of opinion that they will prove to be of African rather than of Asiatic origin, however ancient their introduction into India; for no fossil or semi-fossil remains of this very distinct type have as yet been discovered in any part of Asia, where the only established fossil Taurine is the Bos namadicus of the Nerbudda deposits, which is barely (if at all satisfactorily) distinguishable from the European B. primogenius (or true Urus of C\u00e6sar).\u2021 It need hardly be remarked that the humped type of\n\n* The Bos sylhetanus, F. Cuv., is founded upon a hybrid Gay\u00e1l (G. frontalis) of this kind; and the B. leucoprymnos, Quoy and Gaymard, upon a hybrid Banteng (G. sondaicus). Sir T. Stamford Raffles remarks, in his \"History of Java,\" that \"the degenerate domestic cows [of that island, humped] are sometimes driven into the forest to couple with the wild Banteng, for the sake of improving the breed.\" Baron Cuvier supposed that the true gay\u00e1l was a hybrid between the humped cattle and the buffalo; but he seems to have known only the hybrid animal from the description and figures sent by M. Duvauzel and published by his brother in the \"Mamm. Lithog.\"\n\n\u2020 How readily European cattle resume the wild habit, is shown by the following passage in Mr. S. Sydney's excellent work, \"The Three Colonies of Australia\" (1852), p. 314. \"The cattle in bush re-acquire in many respects the habits of their wild progenitors; such is the habit of camping, and such, too, the manner in which, like the wild [feral] cattle of Chillingham Park in Northumberland, they march in single file to water, the bulls leading; so, too, when threatened, they take advantage of the inequalities of the ground and steal off in their hollows unperceived, the bulls, if attacked by dogs, bringing up the rear.\"\n\nIn the Swan River colony, both horses and horned cattle have gone completely wild, and buffaloes in the vicinity of Port Essington. Vide Leichardt, in \"Journ. Roy. Geogr. Soc.\" xvi. 237.\n\n(What are the wild cattle of Albania noticed by Count Karact in \"Journ. Roy. Geogr. Soc.\" xii. 57? Also, what were those hunted by the ancient monarchs of Assyria, as represented in the Nineveh sculptures? What, indeed, were the Uri Sylvestres which haunted the great forests that surrounded London in the time of Fitzstephen\u2014i.e., about 1150 A.D.? The late Jonathan Couch remarked, in his \"Cornish Fauna\" (1838), that\u2014\"The ancient breed in the west of England was called 'black cattle,' from the very dark appearance of its coat, almost like velvet, circumstances in which it seems to have differed from the races of the north of England, which were white.\")\n\n\u2021 I refer more especially to the later or post-pliocene (pleistocene, or even\ndomestic cattle is generally diffused over the hotter parts of Africa, from east to west or ocean to ocean, and on the eastern side as recent type, the remains of which are found in almost modern lacustrine deposits, where likewise occur those of Bison europaeus of the existing type, as distinguished from the wide-horned priscus type. This later form of primogenius (which is that originally so named by Bojanus) absolutely resembles the most finely developed examples of certain (unimproved) domestic races of large and very long-horned cattle, except that the size is fully one-third larger, as remarked by Professor Nilsson. In like manner, Mr. Hodgson notices, of the Indian buffalo, that\u2014\u201cThe wild animals are fully a third larger than the largest tame breeds [in India], and measure from snout to vent 10\u00bd feet and 6 to 6\u00bd feet high at the shoulder.\u201d (\u201cJ. A. S.,\u201d xvi. 710). The older type of primogenius occurs in the pliocene drift, together with bison priscus; and (so far as I have seen) the size of the skull is smaller than in the other, but the horns are still larger, and curve round more towards each other at the tips; moreover (if I mistake not), they are both thicker and longer in the bull than in the cow, whereas in the more modern type (as in domestic cylindrical-horned cattle, whether humped or humpless) they are thicker but shorter in the bull, longer and more slender in the ox and cow. With the exception of the Indian buffalo to some extent, I know of no other true bovine in which the horns are not both thicker and longer in the bull. In the old type of primogenius, the horn-cores are sometimes enormous. I have measured a pair which were 3 feet long and 19 inches round at base. Another of the same linear dimensions, but 18 inches in circumference at base, is noticed in the \u201cAnn. Mag. N. H.,\u201d vol. ii. (1858), p. 163. I have drawings of a fine frontal of perhaps a cow of this race, which was found in the gravel when digging the foundations of the Houses of Parliament. Of the later race, compare the noble Swedish bull-skull figured in \u201cAnn. Mag. N. H.,\u201d second series, iv. 257, 259, with the superb Scottish cow-skull in the British Museum, figured in Prof. Owen\u2019s \u201cBritish Fossil Mammals and Birds,\u201d 498, 507. The latter measures just 2\u00bd feet from vertex to tips of intermaxillaries. Compare also Prof. Owen\u2019s figure of bison priscus with Prof. Nilsson\u2019s figure of the modern type of European bison from the Swedish peat (p. 490 and p. 415 of the same vols. respectively). Whether the latter has occurred in the British Islands I am unaware, but suspect that it does not, or at least that it has not been recognized hitherto.\n\nPerhaps the latest (though vague) notice of the urus as an existing animal occurs in Bell\u2019s \u201cTravels in Tartary,\u201d vol. i., ch. iii., p. 223: \u201cJourney from Tomsky to Elimsky, in the country of the Tsuliam Tartars.\u201d It seems to me to refer more probably to the wild taurine urus than to the bison; but in either case the notice is sufficiently remarkable. \u201cOn the hills and in the woods near this place are many sorts of wild beasts, particularly the urus or uhr-ox, one of the fiercest animals the world produces. Their force is such, that neither the wolf, bear, nor tiger dares to engage with them. In the same woods,\u201d Bell continues, \u201cis found another species of oxen, called bubul by the Tartars. It is not so large as the urus; its body and limbs are very handsome; it has a high shoulder and flowing with long hair growing from the rump to its extremity, like that of a horse. Those which I saw were tame and as tractable as other cattle.\u201d Certainly a remarkable notice of the yak, both wild and tame (as it would seem), in a region where that animal is at present unknown. The word bubul has probably its connection with bubulus.\n\nThe difference in the development of the wild and tame buffalo of India is equally observable where the two frequent the same pastures and commonly interbreed; and I believe the main reason of it to be, that the tame calves are deprived of their due supply of milk. The importance of an ample supply of nourishment in early life, as bearing on the future development of any animal, cannot be over-estimated. A friend remarked to me that he had no idea of what a fine buffalo was till he saw those of Burma. They are there, he states,\nfar south as Natal, and throughout Madagascar; the same being the only Taurine type known in Arabia,* though, curiously, in the essentially Arabian island of Socotra, the cattle are of the humpless European or N. Asiatic type.\u2020 Both humped and humpless cattle are represented in the old Egyptian paintings; and the humpless reappear in S. Africa, in the remarkable indigenous (so far as known) Caffre cattle, and I have seen fossil remains of the same cylindrical-horned humpless type from the banks of a tributary of the Gariep river.\u2021 In Madagascar, also,\n\nmuch larger than in Bengal, with splendid horns, and altogether a vastly superior animal. The Burmese never milk them, having the same strange prejudice against milk which the Chinese have, though otherwise both people are nearly omnivorous. There is a corresponding difference of development in the wild and tame races of yak, and of reindeer in Lapland, doubtless for the same reason.\n\n* The humped cattle of Arabia generally are \"of a very small and poor race, and are never, but with the greatest reluctance, killed for food.\" (Wallin, in \"Journ. Roy. Geogr. Soc.,\" vol. xxiv. 148). Chesney remarks of them, that \"bulls and cows take the next place to the buffalo, and, like those of India, they bear a hump, and are of small size; some bullocks purchased at Suweil-deyeh produced each only about 224 pounds of meat. Again, in his Appendix (vol. i. 279), he enumerates among the domestic animals of Arabia and Mesopotamia, \"both the common bull and cow, and the bull and cow with hunch.\"\n\nIn the province of Kerman, in Persia, Mr. Keith C. Abbot remarks that \"the oxen of this part of the country are of a small humped kind, and are commonly used as beasts of burthen; people also ride on them, seated on a soft pad, and a rope is passed through the nostril, by which they are guided.\" (\"Journ. Roy. Geogr. Soc.,\" vol. xxv. 43.)\n\n\u2020 Vide Wellsted in \"Journ. Roy. Geogr. Soc.,\" vol. v. 200. On the confines of India, this European and also Tartar type of humpless cattle comes round evidently from the eastward into Butan. But the Chinese taurines (so far as I can learn) are mostly hybrid, being variously intermediate to the humped and humpless species, except, however, towards the north; and huge herds of splendid Tartar cattle are pastured beyond the great wall of China, many of these, with vast troops of horses, &c., being the property of the emperor. (Vide Tinkowski and others.) According to Major R. C. Tytler, a white breed of humpless (?) cattle is reared and highly prized by the natives of Dacca, who never turn them out to pasture. It has \"little or no symptoms of a hump.\" \"Ann. M. N. H.,\" second series, xiv. (1834), 177.\n\n\u2021 Vide \"Proc. Geol. Soc.,\" 1840, p. 152. Captain Speke observed some very fine humpless cattle on the N. W. shore of the Tanganyika lake, near the equator. \"Very large cattle, bearing horns of stupendous size. They are of a uniform red colour, like our Devonshire breed, but attain a much greater height and size.\" Northward, again, on the shore of his grand Victoria Nyanza lake, he remarks that\u2014\"The cows, unlike the Tanganyika ones, are small and short-horned, and are of a variety of colours. They carry a hump, like the Brahmini bull, but give very little milk.\" Vide Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, No. dxxviii. (October, 1859), pp. 392, 393. A little further northward, in the Bari country, on the shores of the White Nile, between 4\u00b0 and 5\u00b0 N. lat., M. Ferdinand Werne tells us\u2014\"We remark, as usual among the light-coloured cows, many quite white, and few black or dapple. The bulls have the customary high and thick humps; the cows, on the contrary, have exactly the appearance of those at Emmerich on the Rhine?; their horns are twisted in a surprisingly handsome form, and set off with flaky hair, as well as the ears. They carry the latter erect, by which means the head,\nwhere the tame cattle are all of the humped kind, a humpless wild race, not yet scientifically described, was long ago indicated by Flacourt, and since by the missionary Ellis; stated to resemble European cattle except in having longer limbs.* But to return to the humped cattle. These are now the ordinary Taurines of tropical and subtropical Asia, and, according to Kr\u00e4mpfer, extend on to Japan. Though unknown in an aboriginally wild state, the species has relapsed into wildness in various parts of India, as especially in Oudh and Rohilkund, in Sh\u00e1hab\u00e1d, in Mysore, and even in Ceylon; a fact the more interesting, as proving (what had been doubted) that these humped cattle can maintain themselves, and the lively eye acquire a brisk and intelligent expression.\u201d (Werne\u2019s \u201cNarrative of Expedition to Discover the Sources of the White Nile, in the Years 1840, 1841,\u201d O\u2019Reilly\u2019s translation, ii. 94.) It is not likely that the cows referred to should be entirely humpless, and the large lustrous eye is everywhere one of the many characteristics of the humped species, as is the lanceolate form of ear (which, I suppose, is referred to), as contrasted with the broad round ears of the humpless kind; and in hybrids of different degrees of admixture the proportion is more readily seen in the shape of the ear than in aught else. Moreover, it seems that, as in India, white or greyish-white humped cattle predominate, but the black tail-tuft is constant, except in the rare case of an albino. Between 6\u00b0 and 7\u00b0 N. lat., among the Kek or Kiak nation, we learn from the same authority that\u2014\u201cThe cattle are generally of a light colour, of moderate size, and have long beautifully twisted horns, some of which are turned backwards (as also in India). The bulls have large speckled humps, such as are seen in the hieroglyphics; the cows, on the contrary, only a little elevation on the shoulders.\u201d (Ibid. i. 175.) As with the humped cow elsewhere; and when Col. Sykes mentions that this species of cattle, \u201cwhen early trained to labour or to carriage, is nearly destitute of the hump\u201d (\u201cProc. Zool. Soc.\u201d 1831, p. 105), he refers to cows and oxen only, for the labouring bull has always a well-developed hump, especially if well fed, and this has much to do with the filling out of the hump in oxen and cows; the fundamental structure is there invariably, and capable of development. The huge-horned Bornonese and Galla races of cattle are of the humped species, unlike the fine Tanganyika race \u201cwith stupendous horns.\u201d Indeed, cattle exceedingly like the African Galla race of Bruce and Salt are by no means very rare in India.\n\nIt is remarkable that the singular strepsicerine or Cretan breed of sheep exists in the country drained by the White Nile, modified, however, in its fleece by the locality. Thus, Werne tells us (ii. 18), that\u2014\u201cI purchased for a couple of miserable beads a little sheep, covered partly with wool and partly with hair, as the sheep here generally are, with a long mane under the throat, and horns twisted back. Selim Capitan says that a similar species (race) is found in Crete.\u201d Elsewhere (p. 97), he remarks\u2014\u201cRams with horns twisted back and manes\u201d\u2014the latter of course under the throat, as mentioned in the preceding notice.\n\n* \u201cHorned cattle are numerous, both tame and wild; many of the latter resemble in shape and size the cattle of Europe.\u201d (Ellis\u2019s \u201cHistory of Madagascar.\u201d) These wild animals abound in the province of Mena-be which occupies much of the western portion of the island. In Mr. J. A. Lloyd\u2019s \u201cMemoir on Madagascar,\u201d published in the 20th vol. of the \u201cRoyal Geographical Society\u2019s Journal,\u201d we read (p. 63) that \u201cthe northern part of Mena-be contains great numbers of wild cattle; Rad\u00e1ma and his officers, in one of their warlike expeditions amongst the Sakalami, passing through this country, killed upwards of 349 [wild?] oxen in one day for the use of his army, and two days afterwards 431 more were killed by the soldiers.\u201d\nunaided by man, in regions inhabited by the tiger. The origin and history of the wild herds of the Shahabad jungles, which still exist, are given by Dr. F. Buchanan Hamilton,* who remarks that\u2014\"In the woods of Jagadisipur and Damraong are some wild cattle of the common breed; they resemble entirely in form and in variety of colours\u2020 those bred about the villages of this district, but are more active and very shy. The Raja of Bhojpur, and his kinsman Sahbazdeh Singha [as of late Kum\u00e1r Singha, the notable rebel], carefully preserve them from injury; and say, that, owing to the encroachments of agriculture, the number is rapidly diminishing. Many of their neighbours, however, alleged that the devastation committed by these sacred herds was very ruinous, and every year occasioned more and more land to be deserted. The origin of these herds is well known. When the Ujayani Rajputs incurred the displeasure of Kasim Ali, and for some years were compelled to abandon their habitations, some cattle were left in the woods without keepers; and on their owner's return had acquired the wild habits, which their offspring retain. Several calves had been caught; but it has been found impossible to rear them, their shyness and regret for the loss of liberty having always proved fatal. This shows what difficulties mankind must have encountered in first taming this most useful animal,\" &c. &c. The extreme wildness of the feral cattle of Oudh is noticed by Capt. (now Col. Sir T. Proby) Cautley, in \"J. A. S.,\" ix. 623. \"In the districts of Akhurpur and Doolpur, in the province of Oudh,\" he remarks, \"large herds of black oxen are, or were, to be found in the wild uncultivated tracts, a fact to which I can bear testimony from my own personal observation, having, in 1820, come in contact with a very large herd of these beasts, of which we were only fortunate enough to kill one; their excessive shyness and wildness preventing us from a near approach at any second opportunity.\" Another writer notices herds of these feral humped cattle on the road from Agra to Bareilly; and, from all recent accounts, they seem to be on the increase rather than on the decrease.\u2021\n\n* Montgomery Martin's compilation from the Buchanan Hamilton MSS., vol. i. 504.\n\n\u2020 Major W. S. Sherwill, who has often shot over the now famous \"Judgespur jungle,\" by permission of the late Kum\u00e1r (or Kooer) Singha, who allowed him to shoot what he pleased so long as he spared the wild cattle, informs me that, while of course respecting the Raja's injunction, he was curious about these cattle, and had opportunities of watching them somewhat closely. All he saw were rather of small size and of an earthy-brown colour, with shortish horns, and he thinks without the nil-gai markings on the feet (which are often seen in domestic humped cattle). Whether the Oudh herds tend to uniformity of colouring I am unaware. The feral herds of humpless cattle in S. America are, I believe, of various colours, like their domestic Spanish progenitors.\n\n\u2021 In an article \"On the Future of Oudh\" (published in the Morning Chronicle for May 17, 1859), it is remarked that\u2014\"The forests, and notably among them\nWith this fact, therefore, to bear in mind, the excessive shyness and wildness of the feral herds known to be descended from domestic humped cattle, and also the fact (which I and others know from experience) of the extreme difficulty there is in subduing the wild propensities of the common Bengal Jungle-fowl (Gallus ferrugineus v. bankivus), from which wild species all the races of domestic poultry are as clearly derived as are those of tame ducks from the mallard, we are quite justified, I think, in that of the Tarai, towards Nipal, serve as a shelter for innumerable wild cattle, which are admirably suited for artillery bullocks and other laborious purposes, besides affording excellent firewood and pasture for cattle; and also hunting-ground for the sportsman. In these forests and in the extensive jungles, are to be found the hides and horns of thousands of wild cattle, rotting, as it were, for want of hands to turn them to account, and which alone would prove a most remunerative branch of commerce, to judge from the success which the very few who have attempted to realize this branch of commerce, have met with. From the same source, tallow might be obtained in abundance, were there only a few speculators to inaugurate the trade, and to direct it into the natural channels for its development.\n\nThe making over of a considerable portion of the Tarai region to a Hindu Prince (Jung Bahadur), will of course tend to a further preservation of these feral cattle. Another and more remarkable locality where many beasts of the sort (and of various colours) are little molested, is the churr or alluvial island known as the Siddi churr, lying S.E. of Noacolly in the eastern Sunarbans. On this churr there is no high tree-jungle, and scarcely brushwood enough to afford cover for tigers, which do not occur on the island.\n\nIt is probable that such feral herds occur also in Africa. Thus, in some \"Notes on an Expedition down the Western Coast of Africa to the Bijuga Islands,\" and the recently discovered river Kiddafing,\" by Col. L. Smyth O'Connor, C.B., F.R.G.S., communicated by the Colonial office to the Royal Geographical Society, and published in its Journal for 1859, p. 384, it appears that in the island of Ovanga \"the finest oxen are wild in innumerable herds.\" In general, however, the notices of wild cattle in Africa refer either to\u20141. Bubaline species; 2. Gnu (Catoblepas), or \"wilde beests\" of the Dutch colonists; 3. Species of the Hartebeest group, as especially acronotus bubalis in N. Africa; 4. Even the leucoryx and kindred antelopes. As an illustration of this vague application of names, Capt. Lyon mentions a chain of mountains to the south of Fezzan, named Wadan, \"on account of the immense number of buffaloes to be found there, and which are of three species\u2014viz., the Wadan [ovis tragelaphus], an animal of the size of an ass, having very large (or, as is elsewhere stated, very long, heavy) horns, and large bunches of hair hanging from the shoulder, to the length 18 inches or 2 feet; they have very large heads, and are very fierce. The hogna-el-weish [acronotus bubalis?], which is a kind of buffalo, slow in its motion, having very large horns and being of the size of an ordinary cow; and the white buffalo [oryx leucoryx], of a lighter and more active make, very shy and swift, and not easily procured. The calving-time of these animals is in April or May.\" (\"Travels in N. Africa,\" pp. 76, 271.) Dr. Barth notices the ovis tragelaphus by the name Wadan. \"Wild oxen\" of some sort are stated to inhabit the country bordering on the river Koanza. (\"Journ. Roy. Geog. Soc.,\" xxiv. 272.) Capt. Burton, also, in his recently published work, \"The Lake Regions of Central Africa,\" notices that\u2014\"The park-lands of Duthumi, the jungles and forests of Ugogi and Mgunda Mk'haii, the barrens of Usukuma, and the tangled thickets of Ujiji, are full of noble game\u2014lions and leopards, elephants and rhinoceroses, wild cattle (buffaloes?), giraffes, gnus, zebras, quaggas, and ostriches.\" Gnus, at least, being here discriminated.\nwithholding assent to the current opinion that the Gaour (Bos gaurus), or any kindred species, is incapable of domestication. From accounts of the savage nature of the wild Yak, the same might have been inferred of that species, which we know to be extensively domesticated; or, if we were only acquainted with the wild reindeer as it exists in Arctic America, the varied applicability of the domestic herds of the corresponding regions of the major continent would scarcely have been predicated. So with the African elephant in modern times, as compared with the Asiatic elephant!* Civilized man, as a rule, exterminates but does not domesticate\u2014has not hitherto done so, at least, whatever efforts may of late have been made (with but moderate result hitherto) by the Acclimation and different Zoological Societies. A cultivated country, however, is ill adapted for such experiments. Wild animals are rather to be won over, by degrees, in their indigenous haunts, where their habits of life are little changed by domestication, and their food continues to be that to which the race is accustomed: their subjugation being accordingly effected by human tenants of the same haunts, who can hardly have emerged from savagery, but are practically familiar with the habits of the creatures they seek to subdue. It is thus that the three species of known wild Asiatic Taurines with flattened horns have (each of them) been domesticated, to a greater or less extent, in their own wildernesses. A few calves may have originally been caught and tamed, and some stock established; but how entire herds of full-grown wild animals may be won over and gradually domesticated, is thus told by Mr. McRea in \"Lin. Tr.\" vii., 303 et seq., the Gay\u00e1l or Mit'hun (Gavcus frontalis) being the species referred to.\n\n\"The Kukis have a very simple method of training the wild Gay\u00e1ls. It is as follows:\u2014On discovering a herd of wild Gay\u00e1ls in the jungles, they prepare a number of balls, of the size of a man's head, composed of a particular kind of earth, salt, and cotton; they then drive their tame Gay\u00e1ls towards the wild ones, when the two soon meet and assimilate into one herd, the males\n\n* In a letter just received from Sir J. Emerson Tennent, I learn that the elephant of Ceylon is considered to be identical with that of Sumatra (!), which is adjudged to be a peculiar species (intermediate to the existing African and Indian elephants) by Prof. Schlegel and the late Prof. Temminck, as also by the late Prince of Canino. At all events the Sumatran elephant is described by three or four authors, to whom I have had access, to bear generally fine tusks (i.e., the males), whereas a fine tusker is exceptional in the instance of the elephant of Ceylon. Sir J. E. Tennent's elaborate and most interesting series of chapters on the great proboscidian discloses certain facts, on the family resemblances of particular herds of elephants, which will not fail to interest the disciples of Mr. C. Darwin. How about the elephants of the Malayan Peninsula, if not also of the Indo-Chinese countries, as far at least as Cochin-China? I am trying to obtain grinders\u2014i.e., molar teeth, in the hope of coming soon to some understanding in the matter.\nof the one attaching themselves to the females of the other, and vice versa. The Kukis now scatter their balls over such parts of the jungle as they think the herd most likely to pass, and watch its motions. The Gay\u00e1ls, on meeting these balls as they go along, are attracted by their appearance and smell, and begin to lick them with their tongues; and relishing the taste of the salt and the particular earth composing them, they never quit the place until all the balls are destroyed. The Kukis having observed the Gay\u00e1ls to have once tasted their balls, prepare what they consider a sufficient supply of them to answer the intended purpose, and as the Gay\u00e1ls lick them up they throw down more; and to prevent their being so readily destroyed, they mix the cotton with the earth and salt. This process generally goes on for three changes of the moon, or for a month and a half; during which time the tame and wild Gay\u00e1ls are always together, licking the decoy balls; and the Kuki, after the first day or two of their being so, makes his appearance at such a distance as not to alarm the wild ones. By degrees he approaches nearer and nearer, until at length the sight of him has become so familiar that he can advance to stroke his tame Gay\u00e1ls on the back and neck without frightening away the wild ones. He next extends his hand to them, and caresses them also, at the same time giving them plenty of his decoy balls to lick; and thus, in the short space of time mentioned, he is able to drive them along with his tame ones to his parrah or village, without the least exertion of force or compulsion; and so attached do the Gay\u00e1ls become to the parrah, that when the Kukis migrate from one place to another they always find it necessary to set fire to the huts they are about to abandon lest the Gay\u00e1ls should return to them from the new grounds were they left standing. Experience has taught the Kuki the necessity of thus destroying his huts.\"\n\nIn at least some of the hill-ranges bordering the Br\u00e1hmmaputra Valley on its left, where Gay\u00e1ls are extensively domesticated by the mountaineers, they have been so far influenced as to vary considerably in colour, whatever may be the cause of such variation. Thus, amongst the Meris, Lieut. Dalton tells us that\u2014\"The Mit'hun (or Gay\u00e1l) is the only species of horned cattle possessed by the Meris. It is rather a clumsy-looking animal in make; but a group of Mit'huns grazing on the steep rocky declivities they seem to love, would be a noble study for Landseer; some are milk-white, some nearly black, some black and white, and some red and white.\"* Elsewhere, the herds of tame Gay\u00e1ls show generally a few individuals a little pied or splashed with white, with not uncommonly a white tail-tuft; and they cannot be expected to vary much further than this, unless subjected to new influences, and above all to that of selection in breeding under human super-\n\n* \"J. A. S.\" xiv. 265.\nintendence. In the Mishmi Hills wild Gay\u00e1ls are still numerous,* but we know little of this species excepting on the outskirts of its range, where its native hills impinge on British territory.\u2020\n\nThe Rev. J. Barbe, R.C.M., who seems to have penetrated further into the interior of the Tipper\u00e1 and Ch\u00e1tgaon (or \u201cChitagong\u201d) hills than any other European, even to the present time, remarks, in an account of his tour into the latter territory in 1844-45,\u2021 that \u201cthe Gay\u00e1l, Bos frontalis, is found amongst the hills, particularly to the south of Sitacra; there are two species, differing in size and [a] little in colour; the large one is of a dark brown, and the male is nearly as high as a female elephant; the small one is of a reddish-brown; it is the Tenasserim \u201cBison,\u201d and the Arakanese call them by the same name as the Burmese do. These Gay\u00e1ls are perfectly distinct from the Shio of the Kookies, which are smaller, have a projecting skin to their neck, and differ also by the form and direction of their horns.\u201d Now the Shio or Shial of the Mughs is, for certain, the true Gay\u00e1l (G. frontalis),\u00a7 as indeed indicated by the \u201cprojecting skin to their neck;\u201d this species having the dewlap much more developed than in the Gaour (G. Gaurus) and Banteng or Tsoing (G. sondaicus), which last I believe to be M. Barbe\u2019s smaller species \u201cof a reddish-brown,\u201d as I have ascertained his larger species to be the Gaour (which has hardly even a trace of dewlap). But the Gaour, and not the Banteng, is the \u201cBison\u201d of Anglo-Indian sportsmen on both sides of the Bay of Bengal,|| the Banteng being currently known as the \u201cWild Ox\u201d of the Indo-Chinese countries. M. Barbe has there-\n\n* \u201cJ. A. S.\u201d xiv. 495.\n\u2020 The Gay\u00e1l of Bishop Heber\u2019s Journal, which that much respected prelate saw in Barrackpore park, was, of course, the gay\u00e1us frontalis. But the figure and description given are monstrous, and were obviously got up from extremely vague recollection: the horns turn down instead of up, the space between them is narrow instead of being very broad, the heavy dewlap is not given, nor the white stockings; the tail is figured and described as \u201cbushy,\u201d and as extending below the hocks, and the outline of the spinal ridge is utterly unlike what it should be. He says\u2014\u201cIt is very much larger than the largest Indian cattle [he could not then have seen an ordnance bullock], but hardly, I think, equal to an English bull [!]: its tail is bushy [!], and its horns form almost a mass of white and solid bone to the centre of its forehead [!]\u201d He could only have viewed the animal from a distance, and have mistaken the pale colour of the forehead for a continuation of the bases of the horns. Neither is it, as he remarks, \u201ca native of Tibet and Nipal,\u201d nor even of Butan (vide Turner\u2019s Embassy). The second figure in the distance is meant, we can only suppose, to represent a large humped ox; but here, again, the animal is furnished with a horse\u2019s tail, and is like nothing in nature! Our utmost respect for the reverend Bishop can scarcely pardon him such outrageous caricatures, both of figure and description.\u2014Vide Heber\u2019s \u201cJournal,\u201d i. 31.\n\n\u2021 \u201cJ.

Res.\u201d viii. 488.\n|| In Orissa, the gaour is known to sportsmen and others as the \u201cgay\u00e1l;\u201d although the natives of the province style and pronounce it goor, the names, of course, being branches or ramifications of the same root.\nfore erroneously identified his smaller kind with the Tenasserim \"Bison,\" and is also wrong in applying the name Bos frontalis to either of his species, as obviously so to both of them.\n\nSoon after the publication of the foregoing notice, I had some conversation on the subject with M. Barbe, and have fortunately preserved a written memorandum of that conversation, intended for publication at the time, though it has not hitherto appeared in print. I did not then recognize the third species; indeed, at that time, I had much less knowledge of the Banteng than I have at present; but I now give the memo. as originally written:\n\n\"M. Barbe had informed me that, besides the common Gay\u00e1l (Bos frontalis), the Kukis of the interior of the Chittagong hills had a very different species of Bos in a state of complete domestication, the exact species of which I could not satisfactorily make out from his description; when, luckily, he remembered that he possessed a horn of one of those tame animals, and, to my very considerable surprise, it proved to be that of a Gaour, or (so-called) 'Bison' of Anglo-Indian sportsmen, an animal which is commonly reputed to be untameable. The huge beasts are, however, stated to be most perfectly gentle and quiet, and they habitually pass the night and great part of the day beneath the raised habitations of their owners; and M. Barbe further mentions that he was greatly astonished at the facility with which these enormous cattle ascended and descended heights so steep and precipitous, that, had he not witnessed the feat, he would scarcely have been inclined to credit it.\" The last observation points rather to the Gay\u00e1l than to the Gaour!\n\nAs a rule, the proper habitat of the Gaour is an undulating grassy table-land intermixed with forest; the heavy and buffalo-shaped Gay\u00e1l being habitually much more of a climber, and also more exclusively affecting the dense craggy forest, where it browses in preference to grazing, the Gaour being much more of a grazer. Having possessed both species alive, I can testify to this difference in their feeding. The Gaour appears to be diffused throughout the Indo-Chinese countries, and all down the Malayan peninsula to the extreme south; but has not been observed on any of the great islands of the archipelago. I have lately seen the skull with horns of an old bull from the mainland near Singapore; and in 1858 I purchased a live Gaour-calf that was brought from Singapore to Calcutta, together with a Malayan Tapir. This calf was in high health when I shipped him for England, and as tame and tractable as any domestic animal, yet full of life and frolic; but he was suddenly taken ill when nearing the Cape, and died on the following or next day. He was very impatient of the sun, even at the height of the cold weather (so called) in Calcutta; which rendered it difficult to secure a photograph of the animal, but a good one was taken, and copied in the Illustrated London\nNews; only the artist must needs improve upon nature by lengthening the tail beyond the hocks, which detracts from the vraisemblance of the wood-cut. The Gaour is the only species of the group which inhabits cis-Brahmaputran India, in all suitable districts; extending formerly to Ceylon, where we recognize it as the Guavera of Knox; and in Johnson's \"Indian Field Sports,\" it is familiarly referred to as \"the Gour (a kind of wild bullock)\" inhabiting, in about 1796, the hill-country bordering on the D\u0101mud\u0101, through which the Grand Trunk Road now runs from R\u0101n\u012bganj to Sherg\u0101t\u012b\u2014a district from which it has been long since extirpated, or has retired some hundreds of miles further west. It is still numerous in various localities, and not always particularly shy where little persecuted; for instance, my late friend Capt. Crump (a distinguished sportsman, who fell most gallantly taking possession of a gun at L\u0101knao,) found them so little shy towards the sources of the Nerbudda, that, on one occasion, a couple of young bulls came trotting fearlessly out of the forest, within easy gunshot of himself and companion on horseback, and continued for some time to trot alongside of them at that distance, till my friend's sporting (or destructive) propensities could brook it no longer. Others would have felt much greater pleasure in observing the noble animals thus fearlessly at liberty, and would have been loth to abuse their confidence.\n\nIn the catalogue of the specimens of mammalia in the India-house museum, published by the late veteran zoologist, Dr. Horsfield, in 1851, a Bos asseel is described as a new species, founded on a preserved head, with the skin on, in that collection. I have drawings of the identical specimen, which I pronounce, with confidence (as I did formerly in \"J. A. S.\" xi. 445), to be that of a cow Gaour, with horns more slender and turning back more towards the tips than usual; but I have seen others like them, and of all intermediate grades between them and the ordinary type of female Gaour-horns, resembling those of the bull but more slender, and with always a greater amount of inclination backwards at the tips. The specimen in question is figured by Gen. Hardwicke in the \"Zoological Journal,\" iii., pl. 7, together with a frontlet of a bull Gaour, and the two being by him also supposed to be distinct species.\n\nOf the Banteng (G. sondaicus), or Tsoing of the Burmese (who designate the Gaour as the Pyoung), we possess two frontlets from Java\u2014one of them particularly fine\u2014also an imperfect skull with horns from Pegu, and a single horn from the Arakan side of the mountain range which separates that province from Pegu, both presented by Col. Phayre, together with a flat skin of a calf from Mergui, resembling in colour the Javanese calf figured by Dr. Salomon M\u00fcller, who has given four excellent coloured representations of this animal, of different sexes and\nages, and profusely illustrated the skulls and horns. For this calf-skin, the Society is indebted to the late Major Berdmore. The species was long ago indicated in Pennant's \"Hindust\u00e1n,\" as a kind of wild ox \"with white horns\" inhabiting the Indo-Chinese countries; and our Peguan specimen has remarkably albescent horns, while the single horn from Arakan is darker, and resembles the Javanese examples in our museum. The next and more detailed notice which we can now refer, without hesitation, to this species, occurs in Herbert's \"Gleanings in Science,\" iii. 61. It would appear that a skull and horns of this animal were presented to the Society at its meeting of February 2, 1831; * \"with a descriptive notice by Mr. Maingy; by which it appears that, when full grown, it is about thirteen hands high, and of a most beautiful red colour, except under the belly, which is white. It has no hump, like the cow of India. Altogether, it resembles the red cow of England, but is a much handsomer animal. The bull is a large and fine animal, and, with the exception of having a white forehead, resembles the cow. Mr. Maingy has seen twenty or more of these animals in a herd, but it is a very difficult thing to get a shot at them, as they have a most acute sense of hearing and smelling; one or two appear to act as sentinels, while the others graze or drink. If, in snuffing the air, they find it tainted, off they fly in a moment, with a speed almost inconceivable, considering the form and bulk of the animal.\"\n\nIn the foregoing descriptions, the invariable great white patch on each buttock (whence the name leucoprymnos bestowed on the hybrid by MM. Quoy and Gaymard) is unnoticed, as also the dark colour of the old bull; but the alleged \"white forehead\" of the bull refers doubtlessly to the mass of thickened corneous substance between the horns, which, in our larger Javanese frontlet, is thick and solid enough to turn a musket-ball.\u2020 (Ivide S. M\u00fcller's figure of the mature bull.) But, in a notice of \"the Burmese wild Cow, or 'Sine Bar,' which appeared in the Bengal Sporting Magazine for 1841, p. 444, we are informed that \"herds of thirty and forty frequent the open forest jungles [of the Tenasserim provinces]. They are noble-looking animals, with short curved horns, that admit of a beautiful polish. The cows\n\n* These were not in the museum when I took charge of it in 1841; but only two frontlets from Java, presented by Prince William Henry of the Netherlands (\"J. A. S.\" vi. 987), one of which has since been forwarded to the India-house museum.\n\n\u2020 In our smaller Javanese frontlet (figured \"J. A. S.\" xi. 490), a portion of this enormously thickened epidermis remains attached to the base of each horn, which led Mr. Hodgson to remark, when looking at these specimens as they hung up, that the horns were less approximated at base in the Peguan specimen. However, on close examination, the true base of the horn is seen to be well defined, and the supposed distinction disappears.\nare red and white, and the bulls of a bluish colour. They are very timid, and not dangerous to approach. Their flesh is excellent. They are the only cows indigenous to the provinces; yet the preceding paragraph mentions \"the Bison\" or Gaour as \"attaining a great size in the East.\"\n\nHere the difference of colouring of the sexes observable in the Banteng (analogous to what is seen in the Nil-gai and Indian Antelope, and to a less extent in the Gay\u00e1l) is noticed; and Sir T. Stamford Raffles mentions, that (as also in the Nil-gai) \"a remarkable change takes place in the appearance of this animal after castration, the colour in a few months becoming invariably red;\"*\u2014i.e. reverting to the hue of the cow and immature bull.\n\nThe horns cannot justly be termed short in an old bull; but it is worthy of remark that, when full grown, they are flattened only towards the base, considerably less so than in the Gaour and Gay\u00e1l, wherefore, when but half-grown, only the cylindrical portion of them appears, which has given rise to the reports of wild cattle with cylindrical horns inhabiting the Indo-Chinese territories. As shown by Prof. S. M\u00fcller's figures, the Banteng\u2014though still very Gay\u00e1l-like in general aspect\u2014approximates more nearly in contour to the cylindrical horned humpless cattle of Europe and N. Asia, than is the case with its immediate congeners, the Gaour and Gay\u00e1l; and the increased amount of cylindricity of its horns adds to the resemblance. With much of the general aspect of the Gay\u00e1l, it has longer limbs, and is less heavy and bubaline in its proportions. There is nothing exaggerated about its figure; the spinal ridge is not more elevated than in B. Taurus, and the tail-tuft descends considerably below the hock-joint. Indeed, this animal has been compared to a Devonshire ox; but it has nevertheless all the general features of the present group, and is true to the particular colouring, showing the white \"stockings\" (like the Gaour and the Gay\u00e1l, and also not a few Indian buffaloes). The shoulder is a little high, with some appearance of the dorsal ridge behind the scapulae, but this slopes off and gradually disappears behind; the rump also is nearly as much squared as in European cattle; dewlap moderate, with a different outline from that of the Gay\u00e1l, more as in the B. Taurus; colour of the calf bright chestnut, with a black tail-tuft, and also a black dorsal line commencing from where the ridge should terminate behind,\u2020 the white stockings having much rufous intermixture at this age.\n\nThe cows are deeper-coloured, being of a rich light bay; and the old bulls are blackish; both, however, relieved by the white on the legs, buttocks, lips, and hair lining the ears, which last are scarcely so large as in the Gaour and Gay\u00e1l, but of similar\n\n* \"History of Java,\" i. iii.\n\u2020 This black list is also conspicuous in the calves of both the gaour and the gay\u00e1l, extending both over the dorsal ridge and behind it.\nshape. The description here given is drawn up from Dr. S. M\u00fcller's elaborately careful coloured figures.\n\nThe Banteng inhabits Borneo, J\u00e1va, and B\u00e1li, and I strongly incline to the opinion that the Gaour, Gay\u00e1l, and Banteng alike inhabit the Malayan peninsula and Tenasserim provinces, the Gay\u00e1l, probably, being confined to a certain altitude upon the mountains. Capt. (since General) Low distinctly indicates three species in the Malayan peninsula, besides the Buffalo, in \"As. Res.,\" xviii. 159. He mentions:\u2014\"The bison [Gaour], which is found of a very large size in Thedda, the head [forehead] being of a fawn colour; the wild ox [Gay\u00e1l?] of the size of a large buffalo; and also a species [Banteng?] resembling in every respect the domestic ox.\" There is, indeed, the skull of a bull Banteng divested of its horns, labelled \"from the Keddah coast,\" in the London United Service Museum,* and the considerable resemblance of this animal to the humpless domestic cattle of Europe has been mentioned repeatedly. Thus the late Major Berdmore, writing of it from the valley of the Sitang river, remarks:\u2014\"They are by no means so common here as they are to the south. I have often been in the midst of very large herds of them, and they appeared to me to be very like red domesticated cows.\" Helfer (no great authority yet) notices three species of wild cattle, besides the buffalo, in the Tenasserim provinces. He tells us that:\u2014\"The great Bos gaurus is rather rare, but Bison guodos [evidently a misprint for gaurus,\u2020\u2014i.e., Bos gaurus of Colebrooke, or the Gay\u00e1l.] very common; besides another small kind of cow, called by the Burmese Fhain, of which I saw footprints, but never the living animal.\"\u2021 He does not mention the Gay\u00e1l as domesticated in the provinces; and I am not aware that any other writer has there noticed it at all. Still, I consider it highly probable that the Gay\u00e1l, in addition to the Gaour and Banteng for certain, extends to the more elevated regions of the Malayan peninsula.\u00a7\n\nThe Banteng is the only species of the three which has been observed in certain of the great islands of the archipelago. The existence of a \"wild ox\" in Borneo was long ago noticed by Beckman, as cited by Pennant, who also recorded the occurrence of such an animal in Java, and had likewise (as we have seen)\n\n* Figured in \"J. A. S.,\" xi. 470, figs. 1, 2, and 3.\n\u2020 The words may be written to look very much alike.\n\u2021 \"J. A. S.,\" viii. 860.\n\u00a7 The two species of Malayan wild cattle noticed as the sapi and the sapar-dang, in the \"Journal of the Indian Archipelago,\" iv. 354 (as cited in \"J. A. S.,\" xxi. 433), refer, as I am now satisfied, to the gaour and the wild buffalo. Dr. Cantor describes the gaour to be \"numerous in the Malayan peninsula,\" where known as the sapi utan (literally \"wild cow\"), \"J. A. S.,\" xv. 273. But he enumerates neither the gayal nor banteng in the peninsular fauna.\nobtained intelligence of one \"with white horns\" in the Indo-Chinese countries. In Java, according to Raffles, \"it is found chiefly in the forests eastward of P\u00e1suran, and in B\u00e1li, though it also occurs in other parts of Java.\" Dr. S. M\u00fcller remarks that the Banteng is found in Java in territories which are seldom visited by man, as well in the forests of the plains and of the coast, as in those of the mountains up to 4,000 ft., where it is tolerably common. \"We have likewise seen traces of it,\" he adds, \"in Borneo, and have even received a calf from the Dy\u00e1ks about a month old. According to Raffles, it is also found in B\u00e1li, but in Sum\u00e1tra it does not appear to exist.\" In the N.E. peninsula of Borneo it would seem to be numerous. Thus, in a \"Sketch of Borneo,\" published in Moor's \"Notes of the Indian Archipelago,\" the writer remarks:\u2014\"During the wet season the rivers swell and overflow their adjacent shores, and run down with such continued rapidity that the water may be tasted fresh at sea at a distance of six or seven miles from their mouths. . . . . In the dry season the coast, from these overflows, presents to the eye the richest enamelled fields of full-grown grass for miles around. It is at this season that whole herds of wild cattle range down from the mountains of the interior to fatten on the plains, but during the wet season they ascend to the hills.\" Hence we gather that the Banteng is essentially a grazer, like the Gaour, instead of being chiefly a browser like the Gay\u00e1l, which never descends from its mountain forests.\n\nAnother writer in the same work states that, in B\u00e1li, \"the breed of cattle is extremely fine, almost every one of these beasts being fat, plump, and good-looking; you seldom, if ever, see a poor cow in B\u00e1li. It is a breed of a much larger size than the common run of [humped] cattle in J\u00e1va, and is obtained from a cross with the wild cow [bull?] with the same animal. They are generally of a red colour, and all of them are white between the hind-legs and about the rump, so that I do not remember seeing one that was not white-breeched. The people have no land expressly devoted to grazing, but let their cattle eat their old stubble or fresh grass of the rice-fields after the crops have been taken off; and while the rice is growing they let the cattle stray into the commons or woods, and pick up what they can get by the roadside. The rude plough is drawn by two abreast, which the plougher drives with one hand while he guides the plough with the other.\" This account pretty clearly indicates domesticated Bantengs, intermingled in blood, perhaps more or less, with the humped cattle, though there is nought to certify such inter-mixture in the notice quoted, but rather that\u2014as in the case of the Gay\u00e1l\u2014both wild and tame exist and inter-breed occasionally. However, we have the authority of Professor Van der Ho\u00ebven that the Bos leucoprymnos of Quoy and Gamard is a\nhybrid Banteng; and there is a figure of a cow of this mixed race among the Hardwicke drawings in the British Museum which\u2014as also in the instance of a hybrid Gayal that I saw alive\u2014partook much more of the general aspect of what may be termed the jungle parent. These hybrid Bantengs are known as \"Bali cattle\" at Singapore.\n\nThe Rev. F. Mason, in his \"Notes on the Fauna, Flora &c., of the Tenasserim Provinces\" (1852), remarks that \"a small ox from the Shan country is brought down sometimes in considerable numbers, which resembles in its form the English rather than the Indian ox, but is probably derived from the wild race. Occasionally a young wild ox is domesticated, and brought under the yoke.\" This notice should have been more explicit. Crawford remarks:\u2014\"The ox is found wild in the Siamese forests, and exists very generally in the domestic state, particularly in the Southern provinces. Those we saw about the capital were short-limbed, compactly made, and often without horns, being never of the white or grey colour so prevalent among the cattle of Hindustan. They also want the hump on the shoulders which characterizes the latter. They are used only in agricultural labour, and the slaughter of them, publicly at least, is forbidden even to strangers. Hence during our stay our servants were obliged to go three or four miles out of town and to slaughter the animals at night. The wild cattle\u2014for the protection of religion does not extend to them\u2014are shot by professed hunters, on account of their hides, horns, bones, and flesh, which last, converted into jerked beef, forms an article of commerce with China.\"\n\n* \"Mission to Siam and Cochin China,\" p. 430.\n\nThe people of Laos \"have a great many cattle, very small, which yield scarcely any milk, and which they never think of using. When we told them that in our country the milk of the cow was much esteemed, and that it formed a savoury food, they laughed, and only held our countrymen in contempt.\" (Grandjean, in the \"Chinese Repository,\" as quoted by Sir J. Bowring). This prejudice against the milk of the cow seems to be common to all the Indo-Chinese nations, and prevails also in China, whilst the Mantchurian Tartars are great consumers of milk. Even the savages of the Naga hills, bordering on Assam, reject milk as food, in the belief that it is of excrementitious nature.\n\nIn Fall's \"Voyage to the Molucca Islands and New Guinea,\" p. 361, we are informed that \"Wild cattle are numerous in Timor Laut, of a brown colour, and size about the same as that of two-year old cattle in Holland. The natives catch them with rattan, and also shoot them with arrows.\"\n\nThe Tamarao of the island of Mindoro (one of the Philippines), as I was informed by Mr. Hugh Cuming, is a small bovine species, but fierce and dangerous to attack, of a dark colour, with horns rising at an angle of about 45\u00b0 from the forehead.\" The nearly similar name Tambadao is applied in Borneo to the Banteng.\n\nThese various wild races and humpless tame races of S.E. Asia and its archipelago demand investigation; and though I have before published in the Society's Journal several of the notices here cited, it is convenient to bring them together, to save trouble in reference. What animal the following passage refers to, in Mrs. Graham's work in Ceylon, I am unable even to conjecture;\nAre domesticated Bantengs here intended? The existence of hornless individuals is not more remarkable than that of hornless buffaloes and other domestic cattle, unless in the instance of a race little altered from the wild type. Thus the Italian race of buffaloes, in which hornless individuals sometimes occur (vide figure of the skull of one in Cuvier's \"Ossemens Fossiles\"), is considerably more removed from the aboriginally wild type of the species than are the domestic buffaloes of India, among which I am not aware that hornless individuals ever occur. But I have read of hornless Yaks; and instances have been known of hornless individuals of different species occurring even in the wild state: a tame Sprinkbok of this description was long in the possession of the Empress Josephine. By specially breeding from such animals, a race of them could be readily established.\n\nIn Sumatra, as in Java, the ordinary domestic Taurine cattle are humped, small, and of inferior quality; but, according to Sir T. Stamford Raffles\u2014\"There is a very fine breed of cattle peculiar to Sumatra, of which,\" he remarks, \"I saw abundance at Menang Kabu, when I visited the capital of that country in 1818. They are short, compact, well-made animals, without a hump, and almost without exception of a light fawn colour, relieved with white. The eyes are large and fringed with long white lashes. The legs are delicate and well shaped. Among all that I saw I did not observe any that were not in excellent condition, in which respect they formed a striking contrast to the cattle generally met with in India [i.e., S.E. Asia and its archipelago. India proper is styled \"Western India\" by Crawford.] They are universally used in agriculture, and are perfectly domesticated. This breed appears to be quite distinct from the Banteng of Java and the more eastern islands.\"* What, then, is it? The remark that these beasts are \"perfectly domesticated\" would hardly have been made of any race appertaining to the humped or to the ordinary humpless type, but seems to imply that the writer regarded it as a peculiar species, as does also his statement of its distinctness from the Banteng.\n\nIn the \"Journal of the Indian Archipelago,\" ii. 831, is a notice of the existence of wild cattle in Celebes; but I suspect that the\n\nand certainly do not credit the existence of such a creature. At the Governor's house, this lady \"saw, feeding by himself, an animal no less beautiful than terrible\u2014the wild bull, whose milk-white hide is adorned with a black flowing mane!\" The description is explicit enough, so far as it goes, but most assuredly no such animal is known to naturalists; and with the example before us, of what a writer of Bishop Heber's stamp can make of the Gayal, we may cease to wonder at any amount of vagary of the kind on the part of unscientific observers; though why people of education, who undertake to describe or notice an animal, however cursorily, should make such sorry use of their eyes is difficult to comprehend.\n\n* \"Lin. Trans. xiii. 267.\"\nsmall Anoa Buffalo (Bubalus depressicornis) is intended. In an account of the province of Minahassa, it is there stated that\u2014\u201cWild cows are also found here, principally in the higher parts of the mountains; but they bear little resemblance to the Banteng of Java, are below the middle size, yet possess notwithstanding an incredible strength.\u201d Just possibly an undescribed Taurine may be here indicated.\n\nWhile illustrating the domesticability of all the flat-horned Taurine cattle indigenous to S.E. Asia, it is not disputed that some species of animals are more easily tameable than others; for instance, the American as compared with the European bison (by all accounts), or even the domestic humped bull as compared with the domestic European bull. It may be from more thorough rather association of mankind, from its youth continuously, but it seems from constitutional difference (still the result, perhaps, of countless ages of such complete domestication), but the fact is undeniable that the humped bull is far more gentle and tractable than his European compeer, being much more completely in subjection, and hardly (if at all) influenced by those paroxysms of sexual excitement which seem to be as irrepressible as ineradicable in the entire males of most other ruminants. It must be conceded, however, that the European bull is rarely subjected to like conditions\u2014so much inured to constant handling, and governed by a cord passed through his septum narium. But the fact remains (as attested by daily observation) that, under existent respective conditions, the humped bull is\u2014as a general rule\u2014by far the more gentle, tractable, and inoffensive animal of the two.\n\nXL.\n\nNOTE BY GENERAL G. B. TREMENHEERE IN REFERENCE TO HIS PAPERS ON THE TIN OF MERGUI.\n\nThe Chinese, from their settlement on our boundary river, the Pakchan, have for long periods exported tin to Pinang, Mergui and Rangoon. In 1868, fifty tons were reported, but the quantity was probably much more. Their surface washings for the ore are still carried on by this industrious people. It is believed a large quantity of tin is annually obtained, and that the working is profitable.\n\nIn about the same locality, some years ago, an English firm of\nRangoon prosecuted some stream works, but they did not pay expenses. There were also mining operations under skilled superintendence, \"which had had to be abandoned owing to the scarcity of ore.\" \"From the conformation of the ground good results were expected, but the lode died away,\" although at first it was extremely rich and produced solid lumps of tin ore.\n\nThere is no mention of any tin-mining in the neighbourhood of Mergui, where more than half a ton of clean ore was procured in 1842 from the Kahan Hill, and sent to England; specimens of which are still in the Museum of Economic Geology in Jermyn Street, and in the Indian Museum. An analysis of these ores, communicated by Dr. Forbes Watson, gave the following results:\n\n|                | No. 1. Kahan tin ore. | No. 2. Mergui. | No 3. Tenasserim. |\n|----------------|-----------------------|---------------|------------------|\n| Silica         | 27'55                 | 10'91         | 7'99             |\n| Tin oxide      | *55'18                | *72'20        | *65'54           |\n| Iron and aluminum oxide | 10'54     | 7'52          | 15'73            |\n| Calcium oxide  | 3'82                  | 7'76          | 10'27            |\n| Magnesium, &c. | 2'92                  | 2'33          | trace.           |\n\nThese deposits occur on the same peninsula, and are similar to the ores from which the Banca and \"Straits\" tin is obtained. They are smelted at little cost, as charcoal to any quantity can be made in the forests, which cover nearly the whole of the province of Tenasserim. The climate is generally healthy; the heavy periodical rains and perpetual verdure render the air cool and agreeable at all seasons. The Kahan Hill, which is eleven miles distant from Mergui by the river route, is 1,920 yards in circumference. Tin ore has been dug out on both sides of the hill. It is isolated, in an open plain, entirely free from jungle, and within a quarter of a mile of water communication by the Tenasserim where the river is a mile in breadth, leading to a sheltered roadstead off the town of Mergui, of from 9,000 to 10,000 inhabitants, from which steamers go periodically to Moulmein and Rangoon. Native vessels also ply frequently to Pinang and Singapore, and there is no scarcity of labour.\n\nThere are other small hills, like Kahan, similarly isolated in the same plain; but excepting Yahmon, 20 miles south-east from Mergui, it is not known that they have yet been tested for tin ore.\n\nIn 1870 a correspondence commenced with the Chief Commissioner of British Burmah with regard to the terms upon which the Government of India might be disposed to lease out certain\n\n* Metallic tin, 43'41 per cent., 56'80 per cent., 51'55 per cent.\ntin mines in Tenasserim, or for collecting tin in the river-beds within that division; and in 1871 a definite request for powers to work for tin at Kahan and other localities was made to the local authorities. The price of tin was then abnormally high in England, and soon had reached to more than \u00a3160 per ton, causing tin-mining in Cornwall to be pushed forward with unusual vigour. Inquiries were made in 1872 from merchants in London connected with the Indian trade, \"whose attention had been more particularly directed to the valuable tin deposits in the hills called Kahan and Yahmon, near Mergui, as presenting ground in which mining operations could be at once commenced, and as furnishing a basis for the prosecution of further works,\" who entertained and expressed no doubt that, \"under the grant of a lease on reasonable terms, a company could be at once formed to raise the necessary capital, and open mines at these places.\" The correspondence, however, was protracted, and it was not until May 1873 that it was notified that, \"with the exception of the Malewoon township and the upper Tenasserim, the whole of the tin localities of the Mergui and Tavoy districts were available for mining purposes;\" and in 1874 the draft of the lease of a tract near Mergui was issued, defining the conditions upon which the sanction of the Government of India could be obtained.\n\nFour years having elapsed since the subject was first mooted, and the price of tin in England in the meantime having fallen about \u00a360 per ton, it was thought useless to attempt to procure capital in London for tin-mining in Mergui, and the project had therefore, for the time, to be abandoned.\n\nThe terms of lease then proposed by the Indian Government were, a yearly rent of 1,000 rupees, and a royalty of 10 per cent. of the value of metals and metallic ores raised, after the same shall have been dressed and made merchantable, either for smelting on the spot, or intended for exportation in an unprepared and un-smelted condition.\n\nAlso, if after the third year the aforesaid royalty should not exceed 1,000 rupees, then the rent for such year to be increased to 2,000 rupees.\n\nIt cannot be said that these terms are encouraging for mining, which of all enterprises is one of the most uncertain.\n\nG.
