S. B.\n\nNovember, 1901.\nPREFACE.\n\nIt was in October, 1900, that the late Mr. F. F. Arbuthnot made arrangements with me for the publication of this volume. It has now to put forth bereft of his guidance. I can but trust that he would have given to the finished work the welcome with which he greeted the small portion I was able to show him in print. It is natural to feel towards him what he has expressed in his dedication of the Assemblies of Al Hariri to Chenery, and to hope he may be glad of the fulfilment of this piece of his work.\n\nThe little history which is reproduced in this volume has few, if any, compeers, inasmuch as it is the work of a Musalm\u0101ni, and lights up her woman's world. She writes colloquially and without pose, and is unaffected and spontaneous. For these reasons I have tried to make an accurate copy of her text, and to preserve her characteristics of orthography and diction; and this the more that the British Museum MS. may be her very own, unique, and autographic. With a few chosen exceptions, I have reproduced all her deflections from common rule without comment; my additions to the MS. are limited to a few iz\u0101fats and other signs of which example is given at some place in the MS..\n\nPrincess Rose-body has rendered one essential service to history, by giving precise details of relationship in her own and some contemporary families. Up till now, however, no use has been made of her information, and her book has remained, both in India and Europe, a literary pardanishin.\nThe Biographical Appendix, which I have modelled in admiration of Professor Blochmann's in his *Ain-i-akbari*, will, I hope, be of use to future writers. It is the outcome of the notes of several years, but it is incomplete and over brief. Nevertheless, it discloses the elements of many a romantic story.\n\nOne of an author's most agreeable final touches is the expression of thanks to those who have helped his book on its way. My obligation to my husband is too great to be told. I am much indebted to Mr. A. G. Ellis for his unfailing kindness during the long and pleasant time of my work in the British Museum, and to my friends Mr. E. H. Whinfield and Mr. W. Irvine for the expression of their opinions on several perplexing points. As I have said in writing of the plates, I owe all my illustrations but one to Mr. Bourdillon, B.C.S..\n\nThe printing of a book so full as is this one of unfamiliar names and of diacritically-marked letters entails a heavy tax upon proof-readers and compositors. I wish to express my sense of this, and to thank Messrs. Billing, their proof-readers and their compositors for what they have done to accomplish a difficult and tiresome task. My thanks are indeed due and are offered to Messrs. Drugelin for the patience and skill with which they have dealt with Persian copy from my untrained hand.\n\nI now venture to express, in Mr. E. Granville Browne's words, the thought which haunts all who make a book, and to beg my critics to listen to their plea:\n\n'Now, seeing that to fail and fall is the fate of all, and to claim exemption from the lot of humanity a proof of pride and vanity, and somewhat of mercy our common need; therefore let such as read, and errors detect, either ignore or neglect, or correct and conceal them, rather than revile and reveal them.'\n# TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n| Section                                                                 | Page |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|\n| Preface                                                                | vii  |\n| List of Illustrations, and Note on them                                | xi, xiii |\n| **Introduction:**                                                      |      |\n| Part I: Biographical Account of Gul-badan Begam and her Family         | 1    |\n| Part II: Gul-badan Begam's Book, the 'Humayun-nama'                    | 77   |\n| Note on the Persian Titles                                             | 82   |\n| Translation of the 'Humayun-nama' of Gul-badan Begam                   | 83   |\n| Appendix A.

It and Plate No. II. make silent protest against printing, and plead that the sun best shows the grace and beauty of manuscript.\n\nWith the exception of the first illustration, all the plates are photographic reproductions from a splendidly illustrated Persian MS., entitled the *T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-kh\u0101nd\u0101n-i-tim\u016briya*, which is the choicest volume in the library with which Maulvi Kh\u016bda-baksh Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur has enriched the city of Patna.\u00b9\n\nThe Emperor Sh\u0101h-jah\u0101n appears to have paid R.8,000 for the illustrations in the volume. The MS. itself is of older date, and Mr. Beveridge has found in it some portions, at least, of the *T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-alfi*. The title-page is wanting.\n\nThe volume has a further distinction, inasmuch as it bears on an opening page an autograph note of Sh\u0101h-jah\u0101n. This is reproduced (as Plate No. II.) on the opposite page, and by its charm and grace is worthy of that royal fount of creative beauty.\n\nThe pictures of B\u0101bar's devotion of himself and the triad connected with the birth of Akbar are admirable; they repay close attention and enlargement under a glass.\n\n\u00b9 A copy of the Maulvi's catalogue (published while he was Chief Justice in Hyd\u0101r\u0101b\u0101d) is in the British Museum, and may be consulted for some details of the book. (p. 110) Mr. Beveridge also gives some particulars about it in the *R.A.S. Journal*, January, 1901, p. 81.\nI am indebted for these pictures, first to Mr. Beveridge who, when he examined this *T\u0101r\u012bkh* in 1899, thought of my book, and, secondly, to Mr. Bourdillon, the then Commissioner of Patna, who most kindly photographed them for us.\n\n---\n\n**TRANSLATION OF SH\u0100H-JAH\u0100N'S NOTE.**\n\n**In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.**\n\nThis history, which contains an abridgment of the affairs of his Majesty, *\u1e62\u0101\u1e25ib-qir\u0101n G\u012bt\u012b-sit\u0101n\u012b* (Tim\u016br), and of his glorious descendants, and of the events of the days of *\u02bfArsh-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b* (Akbar)\u2014May God make clear his proof!\u2014down to the twenty-second year of his reign, was written in the time of Sh\u0101h B\u0101b\u0101 (Akbar).\n\nSigned: Sh\u0101h-jah\u0101n P\u0101dsh\u0101h, son of Jah\u0101ng\u012br P\u0101dsh\u0101h, son of Akbar P\u0101dsh\u0101h.\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nPART I.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL ACCOUNT OF THE PRINCESS AND HER FAMILY.\u00b9\n\nSECTION I.\u2014UNDER B\u0100BAR.\n\nGul-badan Begam (Princess Rose-body) was a daughter of Z\u0101hru-d-d\u012bn Muhammad B\u0101bar, in whom were united the lines of highest Central Asian aristocracy\u2014namely, that of Tim\u016br the T\u00fcrk, through his son M\u012br\u0101n-sh\u0101h; and that of Ching\u012bz the Mughal, through his son Chaghat\u0101i. He was born on February 14th, 1483, and succeeded to his father\u2019s principality of Fargh\u0101na when under twelve. He spent ten years of early youth in trying to save his small domain from the clutch of kinsmen, but, being forced to abandon the task, went southwards in 1504 to Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, where he captured K\u0101bul from its Argh\u016bn usurpers.\n\nPrincess Gul-badan was born somewhere about 1523 and when her father had been lord in K\u0101bul for nineteen years; he was master also in Kunduz and Badakhsh\u0101n; had held Bajaur and Swat since 1519, and Qandah\u0101r for a year. During ten of those nineteen years he had been styled p\u0101dsh\u0101h, in token of headship of the house of Tim\u016br and of\n\n\u00b9 In selecting from the mass of material which, without discursive-\nness, might have been included under the above heading, only that has\nbeen used which concerns the begam or is in touch with her interests\nand sympathies.\n\nThis Introduction corrects several errors which occur in an article\non the life and writings of the begam, and which was published by me\nin the Calcutta Review, April, 1898.\nhis independent sovereignty. To translate *p\u0101dsh\u0101h*, however, as is often done, by the word *emperor* would give a wrong impression of B\u0101bar\u2019s status amongst rulers at this height of his rising fortunes. Nevertheless, Gul-badan was born the child of a strong and stable chief, and of one who was better followed in war than his nominal domains would allow, because his army was drawn for the most part from tribes not under his government, and was not territorial and of K\u0101bul but personal and inherited.\n\nB\u0101bar says that he cherished the desire to conquer beyond the Indus for nineteen years. At the date of Gul-badan\u2019s birth he was engaged in the attempt, and succeeded when she was about two and a half years old. He then became the first T\u00fcrki sovereign in Hind\u016bst\u0101n, and the founder of its miscalled Mughal dynasty.\n\nIf the princess had first seen light in London instead of in K\u0101bul, she would have had Henry VIII for king, and the slumbers of her birth-year might have been troubled as men marched forth at Wolsey\u2019s will to fight and lose in France. Her personal vicissitudes were the greater that she was a Tim\u016brid and T\u00fcrk. She spent her childhood under her father\u2019s rule in K\u0101bul and Hind\u016bst\u0101n; her girlhood and young wifehood shared the fall and exile of Hum\u0101y\u016bn; and her maturity and failing years slipped past under the protection of Akbar.\n\nHer mother was Dil-d\u0101r Begam\u2014the Heart-holding Princess\u2014of whose descent, it is noticeable to observe, neither her husband nor her daughter gives any information. This peculiarity of omission she shares with M\u0101ham, the wife of B\u0101bar\u2019s affection and the mother of his heir; and with Gul-rukh, the mother of K\u0101mr\u0101n and \u2018Askar\u012b. All three ladies are spoken of by our begam with the style befitting the wives of a king; all were mothers of children, and for this reason, if for no other, it seems natural that something should be said of their birth. Babar frequently mentions M\u0101ham, and calls her by this name *tout court*. Dil-d\u0101r\u2019s name occurs in the T\u00fcrk\u012b version of the Memoirs, but not in the Persian, and she is there styled *\u0101gh\u0101cha*\u2014\ni.e., a lady, but not a begam, by birth. Gul-rukh is, I believe, never named by B\u0101bar. This silence does not necessarily imply low birth. It may be an omission of the contemporarily obvious; and also it may indicate that no one of the three women was of royal birth, although all seem to have been of good family.\n\nThree Tim\u016brids had been B\u0101bar\u2019s wives in childhood and youth. These were: \u0100yisha, who left him before 1504 and who was betrothed to him when he was five; Zainab, who died in 1506 or 1507; and Ma\u2019s\u016bma, whom he married in 1507 and who died at the birth of her first child. M\u0101ham was married in Khur\u0101s\u0101n, and therefore in 1506; Dil-d\u0101r and Gul-rukh probably considerably later, and after the three royal ladies had passed away from the household. The next recorded marriage of B\u0101bar is one of 1519, when a Yusufz\u0101i chief brought him his daughter, Bib\u012b Mub\u0101rika, as the seal of submission. She had no children, and was an altogether charming person in the eyes of those who have written of her.\n\nTo return now to Dil-d\u0101r. She bore five children, three girls and two boys. The eldest was born in an absence of B\u0101bar from K\u0101bul and in Khost. This fixes her birth as occurring somewhere between 1511 and 1515. She was Gul-rang (Rose-hued), named like her sisters from the rose; then came Gul-chihra (Rose-cheeked); and then Ab\u016b\u2019n-n\u0101\u1e63ir Mu\u1e25ammad, the Hind\u0101l of history, who was born in 1519; next was Gul-badan (Rose-body); and last a boy, whom his sister calls Alwar, a word which looks like a sobriquet drawn from the Indian town. He died after the migration of the household to \u0100gra, and in 1529.\n\nPrincess Gul-badan was born some two years before B\u0101bar set out on his last expedition across the Indus, so her baby eyes may have seen his troops leave K\u0101bul in November, 1525, for the rallying-place at Jacob\u2019s Village (Dih-i-ya\u2019q\u016bb). It is not mere word-painting to picture her as looking down from the citadel at what went on below, for she tells of later watching from this view-point which would give the farewell glimpse of the departing\narmy, and, as weeks and years rolled on, the first sight of many a speck on the eastern road which took form as loin-girt runner or mounted courier.\n\nWe who live upon the wire, need a kindled imagination to realize what it was to those left behind, to have their men-folk go to India. With us, fancy is checked by maps and books, and has not often to dwell on the unknown and inconceivable. To them, what was not a blank was probably a fear. Distance could have no terrors for them, because they were mostly, by tribe and breeding, ingrain nomads; many of them had come from the far north and thought the great mountains or the desert sands the desirable setting for life. Such experience, however, would not help to understand the place of the Hind\u016bs, with its heats, its rains, strange beasts, and hated and dreaded pagans.\n\nIt is not easy to say wherein lies the pleasure of animating the silhouettes which are all that names, without detail of character, bring down from the past. Perhaps its roots run too deep and close to what is dear and hidden in the heart, for them to make way readily to the surface in speech. But it is an undoubted pleasure, and it is what makes it agreeable to linger with these women in K\u0101bul in those hours when our common human nature allows their thoughts and feelings to be clear to us. Sometimes their surroundings are too unfamiliar for us to understand what sentiments they would awaken, but this is not so when there is news of marches, fighting, defeat, or victory. Then the silhouettes round, and breathe, and weep or smile.\n\nB\u0101bar left few fighting men in K\u0101bul, but there remained a great company of women and children, all under the nominal command and charge of Prince K\u0101mr\u0101n, who was himself a child. His exact age I am not able to set down, for B\u0101bar does not chronicle his birth, an omission which appears due to its falling in one of the gaps of the Memoirs. B\u0101bar left the city on November 17th, and was joined on December 3rd by Hum\u0101y\u016bn at the Garden of Fidelity (B\u0101gh-i-waf\u0101). He had to wait for the boy, and was much displeased, and reprimanded him severely.\nHum\u0101y\u016bn was then seventeen years old, and since 1520 had been governor of Badakhsh\u0101n. He had now brought over his army to reinforce his father, and it may well be that M\u0101ham had something to do with his delayed march from K\u0101bul. She could have seen him only at long intervals since she had accompanied B\u0101bar, in 1520, to console and settle her child of twelve in his distant and undesired post of authority.\n\nShortly after the army had gone eastwards, disquieting news must have reached K\u0101bul, for three times before the middle of December, 1525, B\u0101bar was alarmingly ill. What he records of drinking and drug-eating may explain this; he thought his illness a chastisement, and set himself to repent of sins which were bred of good-fellowship and by forgetfulness in gay company; but his conflict with them was without victory. He referred his punishment to another cause than these grosser acts, and came to regard the composition of satirical verses as a grave fault. His reflections on the point place him near higher moralists, for he says it was sad a tongue which could repeat sublime words, should occupy itself with meaner and despicable fancies. \u2018Oh, my Creator! I have tyrannized over my soul, and if Thou art not bountiful to me, of a truth I shall be numbered amongst the accursed.\u2019 These are some of the thoughts of B\u0101bar which lift our eyes above what is antipathetic in him, and explain why he wins the respect and affection of all who take trouble to know him.\n\nNot long after January 8th, 1526, a messenger would reach K\u0101bul who took more than news, for B\u0101bar had found manuscripts in the captured fort of Milwat, and now sent some for K\u0101mr\u0101n, while he gave others to Hum\u0101y\u016bn. They were valuable, but not so much so as he had hoped, and many were theological. This and other records about books remind one that they were few and precious in those days. How many that we now rank amongst the best of the sixteenth century had not yet been written! There was\nno *T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-rash\u012bd\u012b*, and the very stuff of the *T\u016bz\u016bk* was in the living and making.\n\nOn February 26th Hum\u0101y\u016bn created news which would be as welcome to M\u0101ham as it was to B\u0101bar, for he was successful in his first expedition on active service. This occurred at His\u0101r-firoza, and the town and district were given to him with a sum of money. News of the victory was despatched to K\u0101bul from Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d; and immediately after B\u0101bar\u2019s record of this in the Memoirs, there occurs a passage of varied interest, although it seems to European ears a somewhat strange commemoration of a detail of toilette: \u2018At this same station and this same day the razor or scissors were first applied to Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s beard.\u2019 B\u0101bar made an entry in June, 1504, of the same act accomplished for himself. It was one which T\u016brks celebrated by festivity. The entry quoted above is made as though by B\u0101bar, but it is followed by an explanation that it is inserted by Hum\u0101y\u016bn in pious imitation of his father\u2019s own. Hum\u0101y\u016bn did this in 1553-4, shortly before he set out to recover his father\u2019s lost domains in Hind\u016bst\u0101n. The date is fixed by his statement that he made the interpolation when he was forty-six.\u00b9\n\nHum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s little victory would be dwarfed by the next news of the royal army, for April 12th, 1526, brought the battle of P\u0101nipat and the overthrow of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Lod\u012b Afgh\u0101n, the Emperor of Hind\u016bst\u0101n. The swiftest of runners would carry these tidings to K\u0101bul in something under a month. On May 11th B\u0101bar distributed the treasures of five kings, and left himself so little that he was jestingly dubbed beggar (*qalandar*). He forgot no one, but sent gifts far and wide to kinsmen and friends, and to shrines both in\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 There is a point of great interest about this note of Hum\u0101y\u016bn and Mr. Erskine\u2019s translation of it. I venture to refer readers who take interest in the Memoirs, as a book, to my article on the T\u016brki text of the Memoirs (*Royal Asiatic Society\u2019s Journal*, July, 1899), which contains information gathered from some sources which were not at Mr. Erskine\u2019s disposition, and which suggest that another reading is allowable to the concluding words (not mentioned in this text) of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s interpolation.\nArabia and \u1e24ir\u0101q. K\u0101bul was specially remembered and a small coin sent for every soul within it. Gul-badan tells what was given to the ladies, beginning with the great begams, the aunts of frequent mention. It was certainly a wonderful day when the curiosities and splendid things of Hind were unpacked for their inspection, and very welcome, too, would be the am\u012br who escorted the precious caravan. He was B\u0101bar\u2019s friend, Khw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n, who had extorted a most unwilling leave from India on the ground that his constitution was not suited to the climate of that country, a delicate assumption of blame to his own defects which it is to be hoped he conveyed to the ladies as a reassurance. After the gay social fashion of the time, no doubt he helped the ladies to run day into night in the tale-telling they loved. It appears probable that there was no such complete seclusion of T\u00fcrk\u012b women from the outside world as came to be the rule in Hind\u016bst\u0101n. The ladies may have veiled themselves, but I think they received visitors more freely, and more in accordance with the active life of much-travelling peoples, than is the case in Hind\u016b or Moslim houses in India at the present day.\u00b9\n\nThe little Gul-badan will have had her present with the rest, and probably, like some others, it was chosen by her father specially for her. He sent a list with the gifts so that each person might receive what he had settled upon. This he is said to have done both in allotting the jewels and the dancing-girls, the latter of whom are mentioned as sent to the great begams. Their novel style of dancing ranks them amongst the \u2018curiosities of Hind,\u2019 but nothing is said about their views of presentation to foreign ladies in K\u0101bul. Certainly Gul-badan will have seen them dance, and she will also have enjoyed the joke played off by B\u0101bar from \u0100gra on an old dependent called \u2018Asas (night-guard).\u2019\n\n\u00b9 I remember a Muhammadan gentleman astonishing me by a story of a Musalm\u0101n\u012b child who died of the shock to her propriety when she was taken out from the haram. He was an \u2018English-educated\u2019 man, and the child was his sister.\nThis and all the begam\u2019s stories are left for her to tell, as she does later in this volume.\n\nThere came with the gifts an injunction which calls out the remark, that at all crises B\u0101bar gave expression to religious feeling and performed due devotional ceremonies. He had desired Khw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n to arrange for the ladies to go out of the city to the Garden of the Audience-hall, so that they might there make the prostration of thanks for the success of his arms. They were to go in state, and to remain some days. He must have sighed as he planned an excursion so much to his liking and in which he could not share. The act of thanksgiving would be done under a summer heaven, in an enchanting June garden, of which the snowy hills were the distant girdle. Our princess will have gone out with the rest, and with theirs her small figure, bravely attired, will have bowed forehead to the earth in thanks to the Giver of Victory. Tender thoughts will have travelled to the absent, and especially to him who loved his K\u0101bul as B\u0101bar did.\n\nIt is remarkable in him that, longing to return home as he did, he should have had endurance to remain and fight on in Hind\u016bst\u0101n. His constitution was assuredly not suited to its climate. His men hated it; his closest friend had left it; Hum\u0101y\u016bn and other intimates were soon to follow the khw\u0101ja on leave; but he resisted all influences, even when he had become so homesick that he wept at sight of fruit from K\u0101bul. Only love of action, desire to be great, and capacity for greatness, could have held and upheld him at his self-chosen post. It cannot be called a small matter on which the history of hundreds of years turns, and yet it was but the innate quality of one man, and that man very human. B\u0101bar stood fast, and India had Akbar and his splendid followers and all the galaxy of their creations in sandstone and marble.\n\nWhen Gul-badan was about two years old, and therefore shortly before her father left K\u0101bul, she was adopted by M\u0101ham Begam to rear and educate. M\u0101ham was the chief lady of the royal household and mother of B\u0101bar\u2019s eldest\nson; she was supreme, and had well-defined rights over other inmates. Perhaps this position justified her in taking from Dil-d\u0101r two of her children, Hind\u0101l and Gul-badan, as she did in 1519 and 1525. Before 1519 M\u0101ham had lost four children younger than Hum\u0101y\u016bn; they were three girls and a boy, and all died in infancy. So it may have been heart-hunger that led to the adoptions she made, or they might be the outcome of affection for B\u0101bar (it is said she was to him what \u0100yisha was to Mu\u1e25ammad), which determined her, if she could not rear her children for him, at least to give him his children with the stamp of her love upon them. In some cases which are mentioned by B\u0101bar, adoptions were made by a childless wife of high degree from a slave or servant, but no such reason seems behind those from Dil-d\u0101r. She is spoken of in terms which preclude the supposition that (as Haidar puts it in another place,) she was outside the circle of distinction.\n\nThe story of Hind\u0101l\u2019s adoption is briefly this: In 1519 B\u0101bar was away from K\u0101bul on the expedition which gave him Bajaur and Swat, and which brought into the royal household Bib\u012b Mub\u0101rika Yusufzai. On January 25th he received a letter from M\u0101ham, who was in K\u0101bul, about a topic which had been discussed earlier between them\u2014namely, the adoption by her of a child of which Dil-d\u0101r expected the birth. Now she repeated her wishes and, moreover, asked B\u0101bar to take the fates and declare whether it would be a boy or girl. Whether he performed the divination rite himself, or had it done by some of the women who were in camp with the army, (he speaks of it as believed in by women,) it was done, and the result was announced to M\u0101ham as promising a boy. The rite is simple: Two pieces of paper are inscribed, one with a boy\u2019s name and one with a girl\u2019s, and are enwrapped in clay and set in water. The name first disclosed, as the clay opens out in the moisture, reveals the secret. On the 26th B\u0101bar wrote, giving over the child to M\u0101ham and communicating the propheey. On March 4th a boy was born, to whom\nwas given the name of Ab\u016b\u2019n-n\u0101\u1e63ir with the sobriquet of Hind\u0101l by which he is known in history and which is perhaps to be read as meaning \u2018of the dynasty of Hind.\u2019\u00b9 Three days after birth he was taken, whether she would or no, from Dil-d\u0101r to be made over to M\u0101ham.\n\nIt is clear that Dil-d\u0101r objected; and although the separation could not have been so complete where the real and adoptive mothers are part of one household as it is under monogamous custom, it was certainly hard to lose her firstborn son in this way. She had still her two elder girls. Gul-badan was born four years later and removed from her care at the age of two, by which date, it may be, she had her son Alwar. In after-years Dil-d\u0101r, as a widow, lived with Hind\u0101l, and she had back Gul-badan while the latter was still a young and unmarried girl.\n\nB\u0101bar was separated from his family for over three years after he left K\u0101bul in 1525. The tedium of waiting for news or for his return was broken for the ladies by several interesting home events, and by several items of Indian news which must have stirred the whole community in K\u0101bul. On August 2nd, 1526, M\u0101ham gave birth to a son who was named F\u0101r\u016bq, but he too died in babyhood and his father never saw him. In December, 1526, there occurred to B\u0101bar what must have roused anger and dread in all K\u0101bul, for he was poisoned by the mother of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm\n\n\u00b9 The account of the adoption of Hind\u0101l is given in much abbreviated form both by the Persian and English versions of the Memoirs. The latter has, indeed, an error which is not borne out by the Persian; i.e., it states that several children had been born in 1519. The correct statement is that several had been borne by M\u0101ham younger than Hun\u0101y\u016bn. The T\u00fcrk\u012b text of Kehr and Ilminsky has a longer account, with curious details which may have been omitted on revision of the Memoirs by B\u0101bar himself in later copies, or may have been omitted by the Persian translator. The former is the more probable suggestion, because if the full passage had occurred in the Elphinstone T\u00fcrk\u012b text used by Leyden and Erskine, it could not have escaped both these careful workers. (This MS. is unfortunately not forthcoming for consultation.) The point is of interest as bearing on the history of the T\u00fcrk\u012b texts. It makes for the opinion that Kehr\u2019s source was one of the early copies of the Memoirs, since the passage is one which from its domestic nature would be less likely to be added to, than omitted from a revised version.\nLodi Afgh\u0101n. How B\u0101bar conveyed the news of this to his people at home can be seen, because he has inserted the letter he wrote to allay anxiety, as soon as recovered strength permitted. Gul-badan has given the main points of the crime. She observes that B\u0101bar had called the \u2018ill-fated demon,\u2019 mother, and had shown her kindness, a sectional view which leaves out the Afgh\u0101n mourner, Buw\u2019\u0101 Begam, whose son had been defeated and killed, his dynasty overthrown, and herself pitied by the man on whom she tried to avenge herself. Her fate is worth commemorating. She was first put under contribution\u2014i.e., made over for the exploitation of her fortune to two of B\u0101bar\u2019s officers\u2014and then placed in the custody of a trusty man for conveyance to K\u0101bul. Perhaps she dreaded her reception there, for she contrived to elude her guards in crossing the Indus, threw herself into the water, and was drowned.\n\nThe letter above-mentioned is full of what one likes in B\u0101bar. He quotes, \u2018Whoever comes to the gates of death knows the value of life,\u2019 and says, with thanks to Heaven, that he did not know before how sweet a thing life is. Here, too, he shows that he felt the tie which bound him to the Power in whose hands are the issues of life and death. He, his daughter, and his cousin and literary compeer, Haidar M\u012brz\u0101 Dughl\u0101t, frequently express religious sentiment; and here B\u0101bar exhibits the human graces of kind thought and solicitude to lessen the anxieties of his distant household and people. He forced himself to live again, in words, the horrible experiences of which he wrote while still in retirement, and four days only after their occurrence.\n\n1 This letter bears date December 26th, 1526, and thus provides a detail which is of use when considering the probable time of composition of the Memoirs. Was a copy of the letter kept? Did the original return from K\u0101bul? The impression given by points of evidence is that the book was written down in present form later than the date of this letter. There are in the beginning of it statements which refer its composition or revised version to 1528. The same point is raised by letters of 1529 to Hum\u0101y\u016bn and Khw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n, the date of which may indicate progress in the composition.\n\nAll the letters share another ground of interest, which is that, having\nThree months later K\u0101bul had news of an uplifting victory, inasmuch as it had been won from men of alien faith, whose overthrow was a plenary religious duty to the Moslim. It was fought on March 13th, 1527, against Hind\u016b Rajputs under R\u0101n\u0101 Sang\u0101, and at Kh\u0101nwa, on the skirts of the yet uncrowned hill of S\u012bkr\u012b. It was preluded by dread amongst the Musalm\u0101ns, and by solemn acts which should make them more worthy to be the tools of Heaven and to enforce the stern belief that in battle with the pagan there was vengeance of the cause of God. Men declared repentance for sin and took oaths of abstinence; gold and silver drinking-vessels, probably of Persian handicraft and artistic beauty, were broken up and given to the poor; wine was poured out upon the ground, and some was salted into vinegar. Where the libation of penitence was offered, the earth was dedicated to the uses of an almshouse with chambered well. So strengthened, the Musalm\u0101ns went into the fight and made great slaughter of valiant foes.\n\nThe victory was followed by change in the personnel of B\u0101bar\u2019s army, which had long been wearying for home and murmuring against Hind\u016bst\u0101n. This was especially so amongst Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s Badakhsh\u012bs, who were accustomed to short service of one or two months, and it was now almost sixteen since they had left even K\u0101bul. Only promise of immediate leave to follow had induced some men to stay for this one fight, and they had been told that when it was over, all who desired it should have freedom to go. Many am\u012brs had given \u2018stupid and unformed opinions\u2019 against remaining in Hind\u016bst\u0101n at all, and down to the humblest followers these views had found acceptance. As has been said, nothing would persuade B\u0101bar\u2019s closest friend to stay with him, although before his final decision\n\nbeen composed in T\u00fcrki, they have been preserved in T\u00fcrki in the Persian translation. This may be an act of pious deference. The Memoirs were certainly altogether in T\u00fcrki, but they were not addressed to individuals as were the letters. It is a fact of interest, and open to pleasant interpretation.\nwas acted on, his master had called a council, and had expressed himself with directness and vigour.\n\n'I told them that empire and conquest could not exist without the material and means of war; that royalty and nobility could not exist without subjects and dependent provinces; that by the labour of many years, after undergoing great hardships, measuring many a toilsome journey, and raising various armies\u2014after exposing myself and my troops to circumstances of great danger, to battle and bloodshed, by the Divine favour I had routed my formidable enemy (Ibr\u0101h\u012bm), and achieved the conquest of numerous provinces and kingdoms which we at present held. And now, what force compels, what hardship obliges us, without visible cause, after having worn out our life in accomplishing the desired achievement, to abandon and fly from our conquests, and to retreat to K\u0101bul with every symptom of disappointment and discomfiture? Let anyone who calls himself my friend never henceforward make such a proposal; but if there is any among you who cannot bring himself to stay, or to give up his purpose of return, let him depart. Having made this fair and reasonable proposal, the discontented were of necessity compelled, however unwillingly, to renounce their seditious purpose.'\n\nAfter the R\u0101jp\u016bt defeat the time came for the promised leave, but there is no mention in the Memoirs of a general exodus. Hum\u0101y\u016bn went with his Badakhsh\u012bs, and also, as he seemed 'uncomfortable,' Mahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja, Kh\u0101nz\u0101da's husband. He, but not only he, had been through one hot season in the plains and another was approaching,\u2014a discomposing fact, and one to wing the fancy and the feet to K\u0101bul. He, however, left his son Ja'far in his government of Et\u0101wa, and returned to India himself in 1528.\n\nHum\u0101y\u016bn said farewell on April 16th, 1527, and betook himself to Dihl\u012b, where he broke open the treasury and\n\n---\n\n1 There are difficulties in tracing the descent of this man, which are discussed in the Appendix.

If he had needed money to pay his men, his act might have taken different colour and have been leniently described; but he had had lavish gifts in money and kind from B\u0101bar, and had been allowed to keep the great diamond which the R\u0101n\u012b of Gu\u0101l\u012br had given him as the price of family honour and which, there is good ground to believe, is the Koh-i-n\u016br. Treated as he had been, his act was a crime, and base and mean. Perhaps it may be set to the credit of the older Hum\u0101y\u016bn that the record of his theft has survived 1553-4 and his then perusal and annotation of his father\u2019s Memoirs. By that time he had suffered many painful consequences of his own acts, and may have concurred with his father\u2019s judgment on his younger self. B\u0101bar was extremely hurt by his unexpected conduct and reproached him severely. There was enough now known of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s character to awaken doubt of his fitness to rule, and to need all his father\u2019s great affection to veil and forgive. From Dihli he returned to Badakhsh\u0101n, and is next heard of in the autumn of 1528, when he announced the birth of his first-born son, Al-am\u0101n. Al-am\u0101n was the child of that Bega (\u1e24\u0101j\u012b) Begam of whom the histories all speak, when in 1539 she is captured by Sh\u012br Sh\u0101h at Chausa.\n\nTogether with the news of Al-am\u0101n\u2019s birth came that of a marriage of K\u0101mr\u0101n with a daughter of Sult\u0101n \u2018Ali Begchik. B\u0101bar sent congratulatory gifts to both sons in response; and he has included his covering letter to Hum\u0101y\u016bn in his text. It is frank, fault-finding, and affectionate. It objects to the name given to the child; it urges action: \u2018The world is his who exerts himself\u2019; it objects to Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s complaints of the remoteness of Badakhsh\u0101n, and tells him that no bondage is like the bondage of kings, and that it ill becomes him to complain. It attacks Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s spelling and composition, and ends this topic with words good to quote: \u2018You certainly do not excel in letter-writing; and you fail chiefly because you have too great a desire to show off your acquirements. For the future, write unaffectedly, clearly, and in plain\nwords, which will give less trouble to writer and reader.' Some remarks about K\u0101mr\u0101n have a coming interest; B\u0101bar faintly praises him as a worthy and correct young man, and enjoins favour for him, without a hint of suspicion that it could ever be in K\u0101mr\u0101n's power to show favour to Hum\u0101y\u016bn. Hum\u0101y\u016bn is also desired to make friends with Khw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n and with Sult\u0101n Wais of K\u016bl\u0101b. He failed with the khw\u0101ja, who on B\u0101bar's death joined the worthy and correct K\u0101mr\u0101n. Hum\u0101y\u016bn kept on better terms with Sult\u0101n Wais (Qibch\u0101q Mughal), and at a later date owed much to his daughter, the inimitable Haram (Khurram), who stands up in history bold, capable, haughty, and altogether strongly outlined.\n\nSomething must now be set down about B\u0101bar's third adult son, who was a younger full-brother of K\u0101mr\u0101n and is known in history by his sobriquet of 'Askar\u012b, which indicates a camp as his birthplace. Neither his birth nor K\u0101mr\u0101n's is mentioned in the Memoirs, as we now have them,\u2014an omission which other sources allow to be explained by their falling in one of the gaps of the book. 'Askar\u012b was born in 1516 (922H.), and during a period of storm and of camp life. His name first occurs in the Memoirs as having presents sent to him after the battle of P\u0101nipat, when he is classed with Hind\u0101l, as suited their ages of nine and seven, and they received various gifts, and not, like their two seniors, sums of money. In 1528 he was in Mult\u0101n, but there is no entry of an appointment, perhaps because it would fall in the gap which extends from April 2nd to September 18th. On the latter day he was received, in home fashion, by his father in his private apartments at \u0100gra, and then, having spent till December 2nd with him, he was furnished with munitions of war for a campaign in the eastern districts. Special injunctions were given to the officers to consult with him as to the conduct of affairs. The interest of these details is their relation to the boy of twelve. Few years were needed in those days to support military command. Hum\u0101y\u016bn had gone to Badakhsh\u0101n at eleven; B\u0101bar had been a\nfighting king at twelve. Boy chiefs were common when fathers were so apt to die by violent means; so were baby figure-heads of armies such as that few-monthed Persian baby who (like an angel's semblance on an ancient battleship) led his father's army for Hum\u0101y\u016bn's help in 1544.\n\nOn December 12th other signs of dignity were bestowed on the boy 'Askar\u012b: not only a jewelled dagger, a belt, and royal dress of honour, but the insignia of high command, the standard, horse-tail, and kettle-drums; excellent horses, ten elephants, mules and camels, the equipage of a royal camp, and leave to hold a princely court and sit at the head of a hall of state. The small boy's mind is clear to us about the horses, for where is the child of twelve whom they would not delight? But what was in it about the elephants? and how did he look when he inspected their bulky line?\n\nHe bade farewell to his father on the 21st,\u2014the Emperor being in his bath, a statement which exhales the East,\u2014and after this, though there are many details of his campaigning, nothing of living interest is set down in the Memoirs about him. In the future he was K\u0101mr\u0101n's shadow, and displayed a loyalty to mother-blood which was natural under the difficulty of being loyal to Hum\u0101y\u016bn, but which made him a T\u012bm\u016brid foe to his house, who initiated nothing and walked always in the bad path marked out for him by the 'worthy and correct' K\u0101mr\u0101n.\n\nComing back from this excursion into the future, to the simple topic of B\u0101bar's presents to his children, there can be mentioned a set which is quite delightful in its careful choice and appropriateness. It was sent to K\u0101bul in 1528 for Hind\u0101l, and consisted of a jewelled inkstand, a stool inlaid with mother-of-pearl, a short robe of B\u0101bar's own, and an alphabet. What could be better for the royal schoolboy of ten?\n\nIn 1528 an order was issued which brought about an event of extreme importance to the ladies in K\u0101bul,\u2014namely, that they should migrate to Hind\u016bst\u0101n. There was delay in the execution of the royal command; and\nhaving regard to the number of ladies, the difference of opinion as to the advisability of going at all, discussion as to the details of the journey, and also remembering that (as the facts about the migration come out in the Memoirs,) there would be many who thought their family interest might be better served by remaining in K\u0101bul, it is not remarkable that there was delay in starting the cavalcade.\n\nThe migration was amply dictated to many of the party by B\u0101bar\u2019s wish to see his own people again; but it is clear that the enforced lev\u00e9e en masse of the ladies was a result of considerations of policy and peace. The city was full of women who, by birth or marriage, were attached to various branches of the Tim\u016brids, and there was conflict of aims and palpable friction. It may well be that K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s government provoked unrest, because he was the son of a mother of less birth than were very many of the resident begams of K\u0101bul.\n\nThe Emperor was put in full possession of the state of affairs by a letter from Khw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n which reached him in camp on February 6th, 1528, and which was brought by a servant who, in addition to the written words, gave him all the news of K\u0101bul by word of mouth. B\u0101bar replied to the khw\u0101ja on February 11th by that letter which those who know the time and writer rank amongst the truly interesting epistles of the world. The tenor of the khw\u0101ja\u2019s own is clear from it, and in part reply the Emperor writes:\n\n\u2018You take notice of the unsettled state of K\u0101bul. I have considered the matter very attentively and with the best of my judgment, and have made up my mind that in a country where there are seven or eight chiefs, nothing regular or settled is to be looked for. I have therefore sent for my sisters and the ladies of my family into Hind\u016bst\u0101n, and, having resolved on making K\u0101bul and all the neighbouring countries and districts part of the imperial domain, I have written fully on the subject to Hum\u0101y\u016bn and K\u0101mr\u0101n. . . . Immediately on receiving this letter you will, without loss of time, attend my sisters and the\nladies of my family as far as the N\u012bl-\u0101b (Indus); so that, whatever impediments there may be to their leaving K\u0101bul, they must, at all events, start out within a week after this arrives; for as a detachment has left Hind\u016bst\u0101n and is waiting for them, any delay will expose it to difficulty, and the country, too, will suffer.'\n\nWho were these seven or eight chiefs in K\u0101bul? Not men! The fighting chiefs were almost all in India; even Mahd\u012b had rejoined the army before the date of this letter. B\u0101bar's word 'sisters' is a guiding light, and it does not altogether exclude the influence of the men who, though in Hind\u016bst\u0101n, were in touch with K\u0101bul and its friction and intrigues. First of sisters was Kh\u0101nz\u0101da, who had certainly a holding for her support; and who had influence of birth and personal, as having sacrificed herself in her earlier marriage to secure B\u0101bar's safety. She was now the wife of a man, Mahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja, who, if the story told of him by the author of the Tabaq\u0101t is true even in gist, was such as to suggest him as a possible successor of B\u0101bar to the powerful and sensible Khalifa. There was, since her husband was with B\u0101bar and all great ladies had been left in K\u0101bul, Shahr-b\u0101n\u016b, Kh\u0101nz\u0101da's half-sister, wife of Khalifa's brother, Junaid Barl\u0101s, and mother of a son. There was also, it is probable, another of 'Umar Shaikh's daughters, Y\u0101dg\u0101r.\u00b9\n\nBesides B\u0101bar's sisters de facto, there were others of courtesy. Such was Sulaim\u0101n's mother, whose anxieties for his future were, however, about to find happy end by his reinstatement in 1530 in his hereditary government of Badakhsh\u0101n. There were the families of three men of Tim\u016brid birth, grandsons of Sult\u0101n Husain M\u012brz\u0101 B\u0101yqra,\n\n\u00b9 Of the two others who are the complement in girls of his family, it is safe to say that they were absent. Mihr-b\u0101n\u016b was the apparently contented wife of an Uzbeg Suli\u1e6d\u0101n, and Ruqaiya, who, like Mihr-b\u0101n\u016b, had been spoil of battle and an Uzbeg wife, was recently dead. B\u0101bar says she died just when he was making the entries about her parentage at the beginning of the Memoirs. This can hardly have been before 1528, because an appointment mentioned on the same page is recorded on its occurrence as made in 1528.\nall of whom were in India, and all of whom were men of high pretension. They were,\u2014Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101, the arch-rebel of the future; Q\u0101sim Husain Sult\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101, son of an Uzbeg father; and Mu\u1e25ammad-z\u0101man M\u012brz\u0101, son of \u1e24usain\u2019s son, B\u0101di\u02bfu-z-z\u0101man. There were in K\u0101bul the people of Y\u0101dg\u0101r-n\u0101\u1e63ir also, B\u0101bar\u2019s half-nephew. These instances will suffice to show the reality of the elements of unrest which conflicting family interests and jealousies might and did foment in K\u0101bul; they do not include the many others furnished by B\u0101bar\u2019s personal circle, and by his numerous and influential aunts.\n\nTwo Tim\u016brid ladies, Fakhr-jah\u0101n and Khadija, both paternal aunts of the Emperor, had gone to Hind\u016bst\u0101n so early as November, 1527. With whom they went or why they went is not recorded. The first was the wife of a Tirmizi sayyid, member of a religious family with which royal alliance was frequent, and she would find relations of her husband in the army. The second, Khadija, has no man mentioned as her husband, an omission by B\u0101bar and Gul-badan which surprises, and which the chance word of another writer may easily fill up. Perhaps these aunts joined their nephew in response to his invitation of April, 1526, that kinsfolk and friends would come and see prosperity with him. They brought their children, and were met outside the city by B\u0101bar on November 23rd, and by him conducted in a lucky hour to their assigned palace\u00b9 in \u0100gra.\n\nFakhr-jah\u0101n and Khadija stayed eleven months, and were bidden good-bye before their return journey to K\u0101bul on September 20th, 1528. After all, Khadija did not go, having affairs of her own to detain her, and this delay allowed the Emperor to pay her another of the Friday calls which he habitually made, during the time of his\n\n\u00b9 Readers who are interested in the T\u00fcrk\u012b and Persian texts of the Memoirs, will like to have attention drawn to the fact of there being a record of this episode in one of the fragments attached to Kehr\u2019s MS., and that this varies in detail from his text and from the Persian source of the Memoirs.\noccupation of Hind\u016bst\u0101n, on his elder kinswomen. On the 17th three sisters of Fakhr-jah\u0101n and Khadija arrived in the suburbs and were welcomed. From all these B\u0101bar could hear the news and gossip of K\u0101bul, and thus add to the impressions which led to his order for the begams to join him in India.\n\nApropos of the aunts of frequent mention, it may be said that both B\u0101bar and \u1e24aidar convey the opinion that deference to elder women was a permanent trait of their age and set. Comings and goings of aunts are set down; houses and incomes provided; advice is sought; troubles are carried to them for sympathy; they are ambassadors of peace; their nephews vie with one another as to who shall entertain them; in short, both the T\u016bz\u016bk and the T\u0101r\u012bkh indicate distinct deference to women of an elder generation.\n\nA good deal about the exodus of the ladies can be gleaned from B\u0101bar and from our princess, who now comes on the scene in her small person of five or six. The order for it was given at latest in 1528; this is clear from the royal letter to the khwaja and from the fact that M\u0101ham started in January, 1529. B\u0101bar heard on March 22nd that all had really left K\u0101bul, which news, taken with the arrival of the main cavalcade three months after her, suggests that M\u0101ham started first and travelled quickly, as being of a small company, and that the rest set off in detachments, as they and their transport were ready. The whole party would get off between January 21st and the end of February; this can be surmised, because the letter of March 22nd would be about a month in reaching B\u0101bar. Most of the journey would be made by horse-litter, and some perhaps by palki with bearers. Men frequently dropped down the K\u0101bul River on rafts, being thus able to do in twelve hours what ten marches covered; but one cannot suppose the ladies would make this adventurous journey, which was attended by risk even when people did not fall off the raft after potations, as some of B\u0101bar\u2019s companions had done. Probably the road taken was that by But-kh\u0101k (Dust of Idols) and Jagdalik, and by Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d\nand the Khaibar; but there is no certainty, because there is no information.\n\nGul-badan travelled with M\u0101ham in advance of her sisters, and thus had experiences all her own and a reception by her father unalloyed by numbers. Her liveliness would while away the tedium of the five months' travel, and help to distract M\u0101ham's sad thoughts from the loss of F\u0101r\u016bq, her youngest born. Unfortunately, she sets down nothing about the journey until near its end. Letters between the Emperor and the travellers were frequent. One of the couriers, named Sh\u012brak (Little Lion), who was despatched by him on March 5th, carried not only letters to M\u0101ham, but was entrusted with a copy of the Memoirs which had been made to send to Samarqand.\\(^1\\)\n\nOn April 1st, and at Gh\u0101z\u012bp\u016br, B\u0101bar heard that the ladies had been met at the Indus on February 19th by their military escort under his master-of-horse, and by this am\u012br convoyed to the Chan\u0101b. This might fitly be told of M\u0101ham's party, for there are other records of covering the distance to the Indus in about a month.\n\nOn the 22nd a servant of M\u0101ham brought letters to Arrah from her whom he had left at the Garden of Purity (B\u0101gh-i-saf\u0101), near Pind-d\u0101dan Kh\u0101n, and this is the last such entry. M\u0101ham reached Agra on June 27th, and B\u0101bar met her outside the city at midnight.\n\nGul-badan gives amusing particulars of her own arrival, all of which she shall be left to tell. She followed M\u0101ham into \u0100gra on the 28th, not having been allowed to travel with her through the previous night. Then she saw her father. Of him she can have kept only a dim memory, and it is likely enough she would stand in some awe of him and his deeds, but no word he has written suggests that a\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This is the earliest recorded copying of the T\u016brk\u012b text. This Samarqand MS. and its descendants (if any) may have been written up subsequently; but the points of this early transmission to Central Asia of a copy and the variations of the Russian texts from those found in India, are worth consideration. There is an unexplored MS. in Bukh\u0101r\u0101 of high reputation.\nchild needed to fear him, and she soon experienced 'happi-\nness such that greater could not be imagined.' Happy\nchild! and happy father, too! who recovered such a clever\nand attractive little daughter. It is not only her book that\nlets us know she had a lively mind, but the fact of its com-\nposition at an age when wits are apt to be rusted by domestic\npeace. Only a light that was strong in childhood would\nhave burned so long to guide her unaccustomed pen after\nhalf a century of life, and only a youth of happy thoughts\nand quick perceptions have buoyed her, still gay and\nvivacious, across the worries and troubles of Hum\u0101y\u016bn's\ntime.\n\nThere were pleasant days after the coming to \u0100gra,\nwhen B\u0101bar took M\u0101ham, and the child also, to see his\nworks at Dholp\u016br and S\u012bkri. He had always been a\nbuilder and a lover of a view, a maker of gardens and\nplanter of trees. Much of the scenery of his new location\ndispleased him; he thought the neighbourhood of \u0100gra\n'ugly and detestable' and 'repulsive and disgusting,'\nwords which do not now link well with that \u0100gra which\nhe and his line have made the goal of the pilgrim of beauty.\nIt is difficult to go back in fancy to the city without a T\u0101j,\nwith no Sikundra near and with S\u012bkri uncrowned.\n\nDholp\u016br and S\u012bkri had much to show of work done by\nthe orders of the Emperor,\u2014'my royal father,' as Gul-\nbadan generally calls him, using the home word baba in-\nvariably. At S\u012bkri, amongst other buildings, was that in\nwhich she says he used to sit and write his book, i.e., the\nT\u016bz\u016bk. There, too, the great battle which had been\nfought in 1527 will not have been ignored to ears so sym-\npathetic as M\u0101ham's. Perhaps here the little girl first\nlearnt dimly what it was to be a Gh\u0101z\u012b, and to fight on the\nside of Heaven. She says that when these excursions had\nbeen made, and three months after her own arrival had\nsped by, the begams, with Kh\u0101nz\u0101da as their chief, came\nwithin meeting distance of the capital, and that the\nEmperor went out to welcome them. There is nothing\nof this in the Memoirs, which are silent after the arrival\nof M\u0101ham as to the doings of the royal ladies. The reunion was soon to be clouded by anxieties and loss.\n\nA brief return in the story of Hum\u0101y\u016bn must be made here. In the summer of 1529 he heard in Badakhsh\u0101n of his father\u2019s failing health, and, without asking leave, set off for India. He passed through K\u0101bul, and there, to K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s surprise, met him, who had just come up from Ghazn\u012b. The two conferred, and persuaded the ten-years-old Hind\u0101l, who was under orders for \u0100gra, to take up the government of Badakhsh\u0101n. Hum\u0101y\u016bn then continued his march, and arrived in \u0100gra without announcement to his father.\n\nHe came to the presence just when, by a coincidence which M\u0101ham may have helped to bring about, his parents were talking of him. It would be natural for the mother, who cannot have been ignorant of her son\u2019s coming, to stir gentle thoughts of him and to warm his father\u2019s heart towards him before they met, and by this to break the shock of the unpermitted absence from duty.\n\nB\u0101bar was greatly angered by the desertion, which in truth placed Badakhsh\u0101n in difficulty by withdrawing both troops and control. Its consequences were important, and caused him profound regret. To stand fast across the mountains and to push out the royal holdings beyond the Oxus from the vantage-ground of Badakhsh\u0101n was a cherished dream, and one which he had taken steps through both Hum\u0101y\u016bn and K\u0101mr\u0101n to realize. He wished Hum\u0101y\u016bn to return to his post, but the latter, while saying he must go if ordered, was not willing to leave his people again. B\u0101bar then asked Khal\u012bfa to go, but this request was evaded, and there is much to arouse surmise that Khal\u012bfa saw in it the act of someone who wished him absent from the scene of crisis now foreseen as near. In his objection to leave \u0100gra, affection for his old master would be a natural factor; another was his own supreme influence, the sequel of his character and of B\u0101bar\u2019s recent failure in health; and springing from his power was, perhaps the dominant factor of his objection to leave,\u2014a\ndisposition to supplant Hum\u0101y\u016bn in the succession by a ruler of less doubtful character.\n\nThe fate of Badakhsh\u0101n was decided by its bestowal on its hereditary chief, Sulaim\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101, M\u012br\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b, now a boy of sixteen, while Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s youthful locum tenens was ordered to come to India. Hum\u0101y\u016bn betook himself to the idle enjoyments of his j\u0101g\u012br of Sambhal, and was there, in a few months, attacked by illness which threatened life and which led to the remarkable episode of B\u0101bar\u2019s self-sacrifice to save him. The narrative of this stands in all the histories and need not be repeated, but for the sake of making our princess\u2019 details clear, it is as well to state what was the rite performed by B\u0101bar.\n\nThere was and is in the East belief that if offering be made of the thing most precious to the suppliant, and if the offering be accepted, Heaven will give the life of a sick man in exchange. The rite observed is simple: first prayer of intercession is made; then the suppliant walks three times round the sick man\u2019s bed. Of B\u0101bar\u2019s sincerity there is no doubt; in mind and heart he gave himself; he felt conviction that, after the circuits, he had borne away the illness. Hum\u0101y\u016bn was restored and B\u0101bar died,\u2014a return from the gate of death and an entry there which might have occurred without B\u0101bar\u2019s rite, but none the less was the self-sacrifice complete because he believed in its efficacy and was willing to die.\n\nHis health worsened rapidly after this and he made ready to go. Marriages were arranged for Gul-rang and Gul-chihra; the am\u012brs were addressed; Hum\u0101y\u016bn was counselled and named to the succession. B\u0101bar died on December 26th, 1530. \u2018Black fell the day,\u2019 says his daughter; \u2018we passed that ill-fated day each in a hidden corner.\u2019\n\nThe question of Khal\u012bfa\u2019s wish to supersede Hum\u0101y\u016bn is of great interest. It is written of by Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn Ahmad, in the \u1e6cabaq\u0101t, who had the story he retails from his father, Muq\u012bm, an old retainer of the Court. Ab\u016b\u2019l-fa\u017cl repeats the main statement, which is that Khal\u012bfa had had\nthoughts of superseding Hum\u0101y\u016bn by Mu\u1e25ammad Mahd\u012b Khwaja, the husband of Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam.\\footnote{Neither of the sources thus describes Mahd\u012b, but a somewhat full consideration of the several Mahd\u012bs of the time allows no other than the husband of Kh\u0101nz\u0101da to be understood by the name Mahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja of the two sources. Cf. Appendix, s.n. Mu\u1e25ammad Mahd\u012b.}\n\nA few of the many points involved in Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn\u2019s story find fitting entry here. B\u0101bar must have been long conscious of the fact that he was not so strong as before he faced the Indian climate; he did not send for Hum\u0101y\u016bn; he wished him to leave when he came unasked; he had \u2018Askar\u012b in the full dignity of a commander near him; as he lay dying, he was fretfully anxious for Hind\u0101l\u2019s coming; he and Khalifa were friends of many years\u2019 testing; both knew the faults of Hum\u0101y\u016bn; if Khalifa had planned to set the latter aside, it is likely that the thought was not altogether absent from the mind of B\u0101bar; it is not credible that Khalifa should have regarded a supersession as practicable, if he had no acquaintance with the Emperor\u2019s doubts as to H\u0331 m\u0101y\u016bn, and without knowing that these were shared by \u2018hers than his master and himself, for the nomination w\u0331 uld be made by B\u0101bar and to his chiefs.\n\nMu\u1e25ammad Mahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja is one of those men about whose birth and descent particulars are looked for with the sure hope of success in the search. Yet nothing is said on the topic by B\u0101bar or by Gul-badan. When he first appears on the scene (in the Persian version, and presumably also in the Elphinstone text), he is not introduced, as it is customary for B\u0101bar to introduce, with some few words indicating family. This omission may be a result of forgetfulness bred of familiarity, or it may be, and most probably is, that he himself first met Mu\u1e25ammad Mahd\u012b at a date which falls in one of the gaps of his book.\\footnote{This omission, and perhaps some others, are straws pointing to the existence, at some time, of material which would fill the gaps.}\n\nNiz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn\u2019s statements must have some corn of truth, and they imply that by birth, as well as by marriage and\nmilitary rank, Mahd\u012b was a man who, without outrage, might be raised still higher. There are hints which make it seem probable that he was a Tirmizi sayyid and the son of a Timurid mother. The suggestion of Tirmizi parentage is supported by the burial of Ab\u016bl-ma\u02bf\u0101l\u012b Tirmiz\u012b in the place of interment of Mahd\u012b and Kh\u0101nz\u0101da.\u00b9\n\nIt has suggested itself to me as possible that Khalifa\u2019s plan of superseding Humay\u016bn was meant to apply only to Hind\u016bst\u0101n, or at least to a part of B\u0101bar\u2019s dominions. Ab\u016b-sa\u02bfid had partitioned his lands amongst his sons; provinces so varied as B\u0101bar\u2019s seem to demand division even more than his grandfather\u2019s had done. We look back to B\u0101bar across Akbar\u2019s Indian Empire, and may not give sufficient weight to the fact that Dihli and \u0100gra were not the centre or the desired heart of B\u0101bar\u2019s. He wanted Fargh\u0101na and Samarqand and much more beyond the Oxus, and he had taken decisive steps towards securing his object through both his elder sons, and had given them charge and work of extension in those countries. K\u0101bul was the true centre of his desired empire, and to force the Uzbegs back in widening circle was his persistent wish.\n\nIf Mahdi or any other competent man had ruled in Dihli, by whatever tenure, this would not necessarily have\n\n\u00b9 It is singular that both Khalifa and Mahd\u012b disappear from prominent place with the death of B\u0101bar. From Gul-badan it is known that the latter was living at the time of Hind\u0101l\u2019s marriage with his sister Sultanam in 1537, because she names his gifts to the bridegroom. A good deal of search has failed to disclose other particulars of action or death of either man after Humay\u016bn\u2019s accession. Khalifa\u2019s brother, Junaid (like Mahd\u012b, a brother-in-law of B\u0101bar), fought faithfully for Humay\u016bn till his recorded death. Khalifa was older than Junaid, and the impression given by the early part of the Memoirs is that he was older than B\u0101bar. The difficulty of the obvious interpretation of the silence about Khalifa\u2019s later life is, that he withdrew support from Mahd\u012b\u2019s promotion, and it is distinctly said of Humay\u016bn by Badayuni that he was made emperor by the concurrence of Khalifa. So there would be no ground for a conspiracy of courtly silence about him. He was probably dead before the exile of the Timurids from India in 1540, because his wife Sultanam was with the royal household, and made her pilgrimage shortly after the exodus to Sind.\nruined Hum\u0101y\u016bn, or have taken from him the lands most coveted by B\u0101bar. All B\u0101bar\u2019s plans and orders were such as to keep Hum\u0101y\u016bn beyond the Hind\u016b-kush, and to take him across the Oxus. The dislike of the royal army to Hind\u016bst\u0101n was a large factor in the question of centralizing government there, and so too would be the temptations to indolence afforded by its climate and customs, to which it was easy to foresee from Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s life in Sambhal that he would readily succumb.\n\nK\u0101bul was made an imperial domain by B\u0101bar\u2019s written command to both elder sons, and his own words leave one in doubt as to his further intentions about it. To whom Hind\u016bst\u0101n would have been given if Hum\u0101y\u016bn had obeyed orders and had held fast in Badakhsh\u0101n, there is nothing to show, but weight is due to the gist of the story of the supersession. K\u0101mr\u0101n declared that K\u0101bul was given to his mother Gul-rukh, and Hum\u0101y\u016bn gave it in fief to K\u0101mr\u0101n at his accession. There is mist over the scene from which only the accomplished facts emerge. Hum\u0101y\u016bn came to India; he was M\u0101ham\u2019s son; she was there; Khal\u012bfa let Mahd\u012b fall; Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s personal charm reasserted itself over B\u0101bar\u2019s anger, and he became Emperor of Hind\u016bst\u0101n and all the imperial domains.\n\nChild though Gul-badan was at her father\u2019s death, she must have been impressed by the events that preceded it: Alwar\u2019s death; her own accident at S\u012bkri; her father\u2019s premonitions and dervish-moods; Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s sudden arrival and the anger it caused; his illness and the dread for his life; her father\u2019s awe-inspiring rite and its bewildering success; her sisters\u2019 marriages, which could not be joyful; the haunting suspicion of poison; the end and the blank,\u2014all too much for so short a time in strange scenes and in a disabling climate.\n\nFollowing the death came the forty days of mourning, and of good works and gifts at the tomb in the Garden of Rest at \u0100gra. S\u012bkri furnished a part of the endowment for its readers and reciters, and M\u0101ham sent them food twice daily from her own estate. The tomb was put under\nthe guardianship of a man whom our begam calls Khw\u0101ja Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Al\u012b \u2018asas (night-guard), and who may be he that \u2018never killed a sparrow,\u2019 and may be M\u0101ham\u2019s brother. If so, he will be heard of again under other and widely different circumstances in 1547. As is well known, B\u0101bar\u2019s body was conveyed to K\u0101bul, and there laid to rest in the spot chosen by himself.\n\nSection II.\u2014Under Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\n\nIn B\u0101bar\u2019s history the man holds the interest and lifts the eyes over his shortcomings to his excellence. No character demanding admiration attracts interest to Hum\u0101y\u016bn, but yet his story is one which it needs a master-hand to unfold. A Tolstoi could depict his faults and merits; his qualities and defects rolled a tide of retribution over him and those bound to him as surely and visibly as it does over Anna Kar\u00e9nine and her associates. From the historic standpoint, Mr. Erskine has told the tale in a way to hold his readers, and it befits this humble introduction to build up only such framework as will support details, some of which concern the ladies of the time, and others of which may interest readers who are not Orientalists.\n\nIn order to realize how fully the fate of the ladies was involved in that of the Emperor, it must be remembered that his occupation of Hind\u016bst\u0101n was unrooted, military and the sport of war. When we in Britain have to lament a reverse of arms, we do it in safe homes and we brace ourselves to what will come next, in the familiar surroundings of the daily tradesman, the usual postman, and the trivial comforts of the hearth. Even Colonials had a refuge under the flag at measurable distance from their outraged homes in 1899-1900. But when the Tim\u016brids were defeated in 1539-40, and driven from \u0100gra and Dihl\u012b and L\u0101h\u014dr, there was no refuge open to all. Their head, Hum\u0101y\u016bn, had none; a brother took his last. Like the Israelites, he and his followers then wandered in deserts and hungered and thirsted; dwelt in strange lands,\npursued and attacked, exiled and humiliated. The course of events was less historic than biographical, was individual and not national. There were no nations behind B\u0101bar and Hum\u0101y\u016bn; there were only ruling families who came and went as they could or could not get the upper hand of other houses; and there was the dumb mass whom the earth nourished, and labour of whom fed, in luxury of life and strength of alien arms, whatever dynasty had just struck hardest.\n\nAn enumeration of the chief events of the downfall of Hum\u0101y\u016bn and of his years of exile will give our required framework. He became Emperor in December, 1530. In the next year K\u0101mr\u0101n took possession of L\u0101h\u014dr and the Panj\u0101b, in addition to his grant of K\u0101bul, and he was allowed to remain in possession of these wide and potential lands. In 1533 there were rebellions of the \u2018m\u012brz\u0101s.\u2019 By 1535 Gujr\u0101t had been overrun, and in 1537 was lost. Years of indifference fostered the growth of Sh\u012br Sh\u0101h Afgh\u0101n\u2019s power, and there were campaigns against him in Bengal, which began well and ended ill. There was growing indignation against Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s character and private life, and this culminated in the attempt to set him aside for Hind\u0101l in 1539. Through months of indolence and folly, he dropped oil on his own descending wheels, and practically abdicated the throne; finally, there were the crushing reverses of Chausa on June 27th, 1539, and of Kanauj on May 17th, 1540. Then came the flight of the Tim\u016brids to L\u0101h\u014dr, and their exodus from the lands that had been theirs east of the Indus.\n\nM\u0101ham was spared the worst of these misfortunes; she died before Hind\u0101l\u2019s marriage, which Jauhar places in 1537. Her son had certainly addicted himself to drugs before her death, but his worst lapses into sloth followed it, and it was after 1537 that the pace of his descent became rapid. Much can be learned from our princess of the reaction of outside events on the inner circle, and she gives details which could only be gathered in that circle. This is particularly so as to Hind\u0101l\u2019s rebellion and the\nhome conference about it, and about the murder in his name, but not by his act, of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s favourite, Shaikh Bahl\u016bl. Gul-badan, like the good sister she was, makes excuses for her brother, and those who have not her bias of affection, can add others and stronger. Hind\u0101l was nineteen, a good and successful young general; he was supported by men of rank and age, some of whom had come from Gaur, and had seen Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s army perishing in that sink of fever and corruption, and Hum\u0101y\u016bn buried within its walls. There was no ruler in Hind\u016bst\u0101n; Sh\u012br Sh\u0101h was between Hum\u0101y\u016bn and the capital. The \u2018m\u012brz\u0101s\u2019 were lifting up their heads again, and a chief was needed. Hind\u0101l was perhaps always the best of B\u0101bar\u2019s sons in character, and certainly so when Hum\u0101y\u016bn had become the changeling of opium. He had the Friday prayer (khu\u1e6dba) read in his own name; and on his behalf, N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Muhammad, a son-in-law of B\u0101bar and grandson of Sult\u0101n Husain B\u0101yqra, murdered Shaikh Bahl\u016bl. The motive of the crime appears to have been desire to place the death as an impassable barrier between the royal brothers.\n\nThe news of Hind\u0101l\u2019s rebellion stirred Hum\u0101y\u016bn to move from Gaur. His march to \u0100gra was broken off tragically by the rout at Chausa, where he lost 8,000 of his best T\u00fcrk\u012b troops by sword or river. Here Ma\u2019s\u016bma was widowed, and here a terrible blank was made in the royal household by the loss of several women. Bega\u2019s (H\u0101ji Begam) capture is known to all the histories, and so, too, is her return to Hum\u0101y\u016bn. Sh\u012br Sh\u0101h promised safety to all women found in the camp, and there is no reason to doubt that he did his best for them. But there had been fighting round their tents before his guards arrived, and some of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s amirs had perished in trying to defend them. It came about that there were losses of women and of children as to whose fate no word was ever heard again. Amongst them was \u2018\u0100yisha B\u0101yqra, the wife of Q\u0101sim Husain Sult\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101. The next name in our begam\u2019s list takes us far back. It is that of Bachaka, a head-woman servant (khal\u012bfa), and one such and so\nnamed had escaped from Samarqand with B\u0101bar\u2019s mother in 1501. The one lost at Chausa had been a servant in B\u0101bar\u2019s household, and may have been she of the memorable siege. Next are named two children, a foster-child and Bega\u2019s \u2018Aq\u012bqa of six years old. Two of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s wives of low degree also disappeared.\n\nWhen Hum\u0101y\u016bn had been rescued from the river by a lowly water-carrier, he made way to \u0100gra, and there had a conversation with Gul-badan about the loss of \u2018Aq\u012bqa. The princess was then seventeen years old, and a comment of his, which she sets down, lets it be known that she is now a married woman. Hum\u0101y\u016bn told her he did not recognise her at first, because when he went away with the army (1537) she wore the t\u0101q, and now wears the lachak. The t\u0101q is a cap, and the lachak,\u2014a wife\u2019s coiffure\u2014is a kerchief folded crossways, tied under the chin by two corners, and capable of much more elaboration and ornament than this simple description would lead one to suppose. This is Gul-badan\u2019s nearest approach to informing her readers of her marriage, and she never mentions her husband as such. He was her second cousin, Khizr Khw\u0101ja Kh\u0101n, Chaghat\u0101i Mughal, and of the line of the Great Kh\u0101ns. His father was Aiman Khw\u0101ja, and his mother a cousin of Haidar M\u012brz\u0101 Dughlat. One ancestor was that Y\u016bnas whose fate as a chief of nomads was in such entertaining contrast to his taste as a lover of cities and books. Khizr had many other noteworthy kinsfolk, but to tell of them would lead too far afield. It is useful, however, to say that Gul-rang and Gul-chihra had married two of his uncles, and that his brother Yas\u012bn (\u1e24asan or A\u012bs)-daulat, the Fair Sult\u0101n, became the husband of K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s \u1e24ab\u012bba. He had two other brothers in India, namely, Mahd\u012b and Mas\u016bd. Their father and one at least of them came from K\u0101shghar to \u0100gra just after the death of B\u0101bar.\n\nShortly after this interview Hum\u0101y\u016bn took the field against Sh\u012br Sh\u0101h, and K\u0101mr\u0101n, deserting his post, left \u0100gra and led off his 12,000 troopers towards L\u0101h\u016br. Under\nhis escort went an immense convoy of women and helpless people, and he wished to take Gul-badan also. She was extremely unwilling to go and only partially resigned herself when she saw that it was Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s will. She bewailed herself as parting from those with whom she had grown up, and no uninitiated reader could guess that she was going with her father\u2019s son. She was a clever and attractive girl whose society was welcome to all her brothers, but in K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s wish to take her now there is something more. It is possible that he who liked her, thought of her safety; it is probable that, as he had attached two of her husband\u2019s brothers, Yas\u012bn-daulat and Mahd\u012b, and perhaps the third, Mas\u02bf\u016bd, he desired to have Khizr too. Gul-badan\u2019s departure from the home circle was perhaps her first adventure into the foreign world as a married woman. By going when she did and under the escort of K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s strong force, she was spared a terrible journey which her mother and the rest of the royal party made under care of Hind\u0101l, with foes in front and behind, and at great peril.\n\nThere now followed that amazing battle at Kanauj, in which 40,000 men in armour fled, without a gun fired, before 10,000. Here again, as at Chausa, the deaths in the river were appalling, and here again the Emperor was saved by a lowly man. Again the remnant made its way to \u0100gra; but, says Haidar, \u2018we made no tarry; broken and dispirited, in a state heart-rending to tell, we went on to L\u0101h\u014dr.\u2019 Their road took them to S\u012bkri, of which the memories and witness to B\u0101bar\u2019s genius for living must have rubbed salt into the wounds of their spirit. Many ladies had remained in \u0100gra, and Hum\u0101y\u016bn spoke to Hind\u0101l of the difficulty of getting them safe to L\u0101h\u014dr, and confessed that he had often regretted not killing \u2018Aq\u012bqa with his own hand. Hind\u0101l combated the suggestion, born of defeat, that a mother and sisters should be killed, and himself fought his way through country folk and Afgh\u0101ns, and convoyed them safe to L\u0101h\u014dr.\n\nHere was a mighty gathering of T\u012bm\u016brids and their\nfollowing, and five months slipped by in uncertain counsels and fruitless talk. The four brothers met often to discuss plans, and it seems that the emptiness of this in practical result lay in what was in the mind of K\u0101mr\u0101n and made him object to every course proposed. He wished to make terms for himself with the daily approaching victor, and to keep L\u0101h\u014dr and the Panj\u0101b; but if this could not be, he meant to hold fast to K\u0101bul and keep Hum\u0101y\u016bn out of it. The fief of K\u0101bul had been granted to him by Hum\u0101y\u016bn; Hum\u0101y\u016bn therefore could resume it. That he would now do so was K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s expectation; so, when Hum\u0101y\u016bn proposed to go to Badakhsh\u0101n, K\u0101mr\u0101n would not hear of it, because the road thither lay through K\u0101bul, and once in that beloved city, it was highly improbable that Hum\u0101y\u016bn would move further.\n\nOn October 30th, 1540, something decisive had to be done, for Sh\u012br Sh\u0101h had crossed the Biah and might appear at any hour. \u2018It was like the Day of Resurrection,\u2019 says our princess; the confusion was extreme, and, like the simile, impossible for us to realize. It has been said that 200,000 souls left L\u0101h\u014dr in flight on that day; an overtax of all resources of transport.\n\nHappily for the fugitives, the R\u0101v\u012b was fordable, but the Chan\u0101b required boats and the Jehlam was in flood. Many episodes unfolded themselves in the du\u0101b of the R\u0101v\u012b and Chan\u0101b. Haidar M\u012brz\u0101 took his departure for Kashmir, hoping to secure in it a royal retreat; Hind\u0101l and Y\u0101dg\u0101rn\u0101\u1e63\u012br deserted and went south for Mult\u0101n; Hum\u0101y\u016bn was urged to put further mischief out of K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s power by his death; he refused,\u2014a refusal which would be upheld in the haram, ever faithful to the injunctions of B\u0101bar, and knowing these better than the real risks caused by K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s disloyalty. Penetrating everything was the irritation aroused by K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s opposition to the royal march for K\u0101bul,\u2014irritation which diffused itself and barely missed a sequel of bloodshed.\n\nThe depression and gloom of the men who were the responsible leaders of the fugitive mob must have been\ndeep and painful; but what was in the minds of their dependents,\u2014the ordinary troopers, the helpless women, the comfortless children, and the camp-followers?\n\nThere were many striking scenes in the lives of B\u0101bar and Hum\u0101y\u016bn, but none more dramatic than that in which the latter's flight through the Panj\u0101b ended. A little west of the Jhelam, at Khush\u0101b, the road runs through a ravine of an outlying spur of the Salt Range. Beyond this it forks, north-west for K\u0101bul and south-west for Sind. K\u0101mr\u0101n asserted his intention to enter the defile first, perhaps with the object of closing the K\u0101bul road. Hum\u0101y\u016bn insisted on his right to take precedence, and blows threatened between their followers. Mediation was made by Ab\u016b'l-baq\u0101, the man who had led B\u0101bar to offer himself for his son in 1530. He directed Hum\u0101y\u016bn's attention to the superior force of K\u0101mr\u0101n, and he told K\u0101mr\u0101n that it was the right of Hum\u0101y\u016bn to take precedence. In the end Hum\u0101y\u016bn marched first and took the southern road. At the fork of the ways each commander and many a man must have made or confirmed his choice between the brothers. And so the mighty caravan split itself, and followed K\u0101mr\u0101n and 'Askar\u012b or Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\n\nWith the K\u0101bul section many women went to the safer asylum. They had no choice to make where the roads parted, but those of them who saw their litters turn southwards and themselves carried by a strange road, of which they knew that it took them from the old home in K\u0101bul, must have had some bitter feelings about their destiny. I believe Gul-badan went with K\u0101mr\u0101n. She does not say so, but it comes out with tolerable clearness incidentally. Her mother, Dil-d\u0101r, had gone with Hind\u0101l to Mult\u0101n, and with her was \u1e24am\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b, Akbar's mother to be. Kh\u0101nz\u0101da seems to have gone with Hum\u0101y\u016bn, for her niece mentions her later as an ambassador from him in Sind to Qandah\u0101r. No other writer speaks of this embassy, I think; but most tell of her other, made later from K\u0101bul to Qandah\u0101r in the service of peace between K\u0101mr\u0101n and\nHum\u0101y\u016bn, after the latter had returned from his Persian exile (1545).\n\nKhizr is not mentioned as with Hum\u0101y\u016bn in the desert wanderings, but he was in Qandah\u0101r with \u1e24askari in 1545. On the occasion of her reunion with Hum\u0101y\u016bn in K\u0101bul, in 1545, Gul-badan says that there had been a 'toil and moil of separation' lasting five years. The lustrum points to a farewell said at the Jhelam. One thing makes for her having gone with the royal party, and this is her lively account of what befell it; but she is equally lively about Persia; where she certainly did not go. She had excellent opportunity of hearing what went on in Sind because she met her mother again in 1543, after she had come to K\u0101bul from Qandah\u0101r. She also met \u1e24amida in 1545, and could hear from her not only about her wedding, concerning which she has such an excellent passage, but also about her visit to Persia. There was ample and easy opportunity for the two old companions to talk over the past and to refresh their memories when the book was being written in and after 1587 and when they were comfortably installed as the beloved and respected 'Beneficent Ladies' of Akbar. Moreover, Gul-badan has a note of acknowledgment to Khw\u0101ja Kisik for help derived from his writings, as to the early part of the royal wanderings. There is therefore nothing to contradict the probability that she continued under K\u0101mr\u0101n's protection from 1540, the date of her unwilling departure from \u0100gra, till 1545, when Hum\u0101y\u016bn took K\u0101bul.\n\nDuring the lustrum in which she did not see Hum\u0101y\u016bn, his adventures were too many and too remarkable for abbreviation in these pages. Mr. Erskine has told them with evident enjoyment, and Gul-badan supplements his narrative with some material he did not use; it may be interjected here that he had no knowledge of her book. For most of the period of the exile in Sind and Persia, \u1e24am\u012bda was a good authority, and more than once Gul-badan has prefaced a statement with '\u1e24am\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b Begam says.' She was one in the cruel desert march to Umarkot; it will have been from her that the princess heard that\nAkbar's birthplace was a beautiful spot where food was very cheap; she was one of the little band which fled from Quetta; she shared the qualified hospitality of the Persian king, and, it should be said, reproduced only a sense of good treatment by him; and she came back to Qandah\u0101r with his auxiliary army.\n\nIn K\u0101bul Gul-badan did not want for old friends and kinswomen. She had her own home occupations and her children to look after; of these, though she names one only, Sa\u02bf\u0101dat-y\u0101r, she may have had several; but there is no definite statement as to which of Khizr's children were also hers. She was not unkindly treated by K\u0101mr\u0101n, as were the other royal ladies whom he turned out of their usual homes and exploited in purse. Indeed, he wished to regard her as one of his own family and to distinguish between her and her mother; but of this she would not hear.\n\nIn 1543 she had again the society of Hind\u0101l who, after losing Qandah\u0101r to K\u0101mr\u0101n, came as a prisoner upon parole to K\u0101bul and his mother's house. The movements of Hum\u0101y\u016bn were made known from Sind to K\u0101bul with speed and completeness, and the news was acted on to Hum\u0101y\u016bn's great detriment. There were domestic reasons why Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain Argh\u016bn should not be well disposed to Hum\u0101y\u016bn, besides the substantial one of the latter's entry and long occupation of his country. Of the more intimate causes of ill-will one was inherited; B\u0101bar had dispossessed the Argh\u016bns from both K\u0101bul and Qandah\u0101r, and not only so, but had given in marriage to his foster-brother Q\u0101sim an Argh\u016bn girl, M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak, daughter of Muq\u012bm Mirz\u0101. This was a great offence, because it was a misalliance in Argh\u016bn eyes and because it was enforced and the bride was spoil of battle. The story of her anger and of her rebellion at her fate is delightfully told by Mr. Erskine, and to his pages readers may be safely referred for the sequel of my brief allusion to it.\n\nWhen Q\u0101sim k\u016bka died, M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak married her cousin, Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain, and she was with him during Hum\u0101y\u016bn's miserable stay in Sind.\nAnother cause of friction lay in the presence of a former wife of \u1e24usain with Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s household. In 1524 \u1e24usain had allied himself with Khal\u012bfa\u2019s family by marrying his daughter Gul-barg. As the fact adds to the domestic complication, it may be mentioned that at the same time \u1e24usain\u2019s stepdaughter, N\u0101h\u012bd, the child of Q\u0101sim and M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak, married Khal\u012bfa\u2019s son, Mu\u1e25ibb-\u2018ali. \u1e24usain and Gul-barg (Rose-leaf) did not get on well, and she left him after what M\u012br Ma\u2019s\u016bm calls two years of wedded life. She then, says the same author, went to India with Jannat-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b (Hum\u0101y\u016bn) \u2018previous to the fitrat.\u2019 This last word is frequently used of the rout at Chausa in 1539, but the next nearest catastrophe to which it would apply after 1524 is the death of B\u0101bar, because Gul-barg is named by Gul-badan in Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s household shortly after his accession. She was with him in Sind in 1541 onwards, and so, too, was Sult\u0101nam,\u00b9 who was perhaps her mother, and both were unlikely to make the best of Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain to Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\n\nIn 1545 K\u0101bul heard that Hum\u0101y\u016bn was on his way back from Persia with the Sh\u0101h\u2019s army behind him. A first result of this was to bring the little Akbar within reach of Kh\u0101nz\u0101da and to her charge. All the histories tell of his wintry journey from Qandah\u0101r taken with Bakhshi-b\u0101n\u016b, the one being under three and the other about four. Their coming adds a touch of tenderness to the historic Kh\u0101nz\u0101da, who paces through the histories sad and wise and trusted. She kissed the baby feet and hands of Akbar, and declared they were the very hands and feet of B\u0101bar, and that he was like him altogether. Her first marriage with Shaib\u0101n\u012b had been made to save B\u0101bar from captivity or death. She was divorced because suspected of leaning to his side when his interests conflicted with her husband\u2019s, and she had been restored to him (1511) when she was about thirty-\n\n\u00b9 The presence of Sult\u0101nam here, and a royal permission allowed to her to go to Makka and take her daughter also, gives the impression that Khal\u012bfa is dead.\nthree years old.\\footnote{The date of her return by Sh\u0101h Isma'il to B\u0101bar in 1511 falls in one of the long gaps (eleven years) of the Memoirs. This covers also, it is probable, B\u0101bar's first association with Mahd\u012b and the latter's marriage with Kh\u0101nz\u0101da.} To the reader's fancy she wears a mourning garb; she is mentioned with deference, and is a dignified figure in the turmoil of her day. Her third marriage,\u2014she was doubly widowed at Merv,\u2014takes an impersonal colour, as an alliance which her age, story and loss of her only son make seem rather one contracted to confer honour and afford her a safe home, than on any ground of personal affection. She bore Mahd\u012b no child; she adopted his sister Sult\u0101nam at the age of two, and reared her to become the wife of Hind\u0101l.\n\nBy March 21st Hum\u0101y\u016bn was besieging Qandah\u0101r, and he then sent an envoy to K\u0101bul, who would be a welcome guest as teller of the events since Hum\u0101y\u016bn had left Quetta in 1543. This was Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101rl\u016b, and with him went B\u0101yaz\u012bd b\u012by\u0101t. Bair\u0101m saw Akbar, and could take back to Ham\u012bda news of his welfare; and also a number of princes who were kept in K\u0101bul under K\u0101mr\u0101n's eye. These were Hind\u0101l, Y\u0101dg\u0101r-n\u0101s\u012br, some of the 'mirz\u0101s,' Sulaim\u0101n, Haram and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm.\n\nBair\u0101m spent six weeks waiting till K\u0101mr\u0101n should choose his course now that he knew his brother was the stronger; and when he left the city, he was accompanied by Kh\u0101nz\u0101da, charged to mollify Hum\u0101y\u016bn and smooth the way for 'Askar\u012b when the latter should submit. She went into Qandah\u0101r, but her presence did not bring about the immediate surrender, and the weary siege carried on its burden of suffering. Many of the am\u012brs of the defence began to slip away; the two Khizrs, Haz\u0101ra and Chaghat\u0101i, dropped themselves over the wall. The first got away to the mountains with adventures which fit a Highland setting; the second sought Hum\u0101y\u016bn and obtained forgiveness.\n\nQandah\u0101r was surrendered on September 3rd, and 'Askar\u012b and his am\u012brs came out with swords hung round their\nnecks, and some having winding-sheets in their hands. He was forgiven, and a feast with wine and talk and music sped the night away. While \u1e24askar\u012b was gay with the rest, someone laid before him his own letters to the Biluch\u012b chiefs of whom Gul-badan tells, urging them to capture Hum\u0101y\u016bn when he was in flight from Quetta. This was Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s revenge.\n\nMeantime K\u0101mr\u0101n was in singular isolation in K\u0101bul. He heard of the fall of Qandah\u0101r, of the move of the royal army for K\u0101bul, of the death of the travel-worn Kh\u0101nz\u0101da, and of the escape of some of his princely d\u00e9tenu. He was depressed and irritable. He sent troops out to meet Hum\u0101y\u016bn, but there was no fighting, and he fled by way of Ghazn\u012b to Sind. Then came the end of the \u2018toil and moil\u2019 of separation, and Gul-badan met her brother again after five years, on November 15th, 1545. For awhile there was peace and festivity in K\u0101bul. \u1e24am\u012bda followed the army in the spring; she had now a second child, a girl, born in Persia, and she took possession once more of her first-born. Hum\u0101y\u016bn wished to see if Akbar, whom his mother had had to desert at Quetta when he was fourteen months old, would remember her now. He had him taken into a room in which a number of ladies had assembled and seated him on the masnad. The child recognized \u1e24am\u012bda, and made his way to her arms. Ab\u016b'l-fa\u017cl, who tells the story, gives all the credit of the recognition to the boy; but to those not dazzled by the light in which Akbar lived for his historian, it seems extremely probable that the child had some help from the smile which he had known as one of the first happy things of life.\n\nIn the spring, too, Hum\u0101y\u016bn set out on a campaign in Badakhsh\u0101n. He sent word back to the governor of K\u0101bul, Uncle Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24\u0101li, that he was to strangle Y\u0101dg\u0101rn\u0101\u1e63\u012br, who had been tried and condemned to death for treachery. The khw\u0101ja declined the office. \u2018How should I kill the m\u012brz\u0101, I who have never killed a sparrow?\u2019 This uncle (\u1e6dagh\u0101\u012b) seems a mild man for his post. Another\nexecutioner was found, and the m\u012brz\u0101 \u2018was relieved of the pains of existence.\u2019\n\nHum\u0101y\u016bn took \u1e24askar\u012b with him as a precautionary measure. Of the ladies, M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak went, and in attendance, Bibi F\u0101\u1e6dima, the chief armed woman of his haram and mother of Zuhra, whom Hamida\u2019s brother was to marry and murder. Near Khishm Hum\u0101y\u016bn fell alarmingly ill and lay unconscious for four days. He had nurses at hand whose excellence is attested by the annals, and it adds life to the scene to know that the long watch over the unconscious man was broken by his opening his eyes just when M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak was dropping pomegranate-juice into his mouth. He recovered, but it was a perilous time for him and his supremacy, and had a bad sequel.\n\nNews of the illness went to Sind, and K\u0101mr\u0101n, reinforced by his father-in-law, \u1e24usain, hurried up and seized K\u0101bul. Winter was at its depth on the passes, and the am\u012brs with the royal force were anxious to get back to protect their families. They had premonitions that he would take the city again, and many slipped away in small parties and went to K\u0101bul, where they found all their anticipations and dread justified. It does not seem right to stigmatize their leaving Hum\u0101y\u016bn as traitorous; they had their own people to save, and this might be done by slight show of submission to K\u0101mr\u0101n. No one can consider Hum\u0101y\u016bn a man who had claim to fidelity when the lives and honour of wives and children were in the balance. Indeed, to have left K\u0101bul under the charge of Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Al\u012b was to court disaster, and to make reasonable a good deal of independence of action in those whose unarmed people he could not protect.\n\nEvery fear of the am\u012brs was justified. On his northward march K\u0101mr\u0101n passed through Ghazn\u012b, where Zahid Beg was governor. He it was who when offered a Bengal appointment in 1538, had asked Hum\u0101y\u016bn if he could not find another place to kill him in. He had not waited for a reply, but had left Bengal, and helped Hind\u0101l to rebel in \u0100gra. K\u0101mr\u0101n now answered his question in Ghazn\u012b, and after this murder hurried off towards K\u0101bul. \u2018It was\nmorning, and the K\u0101bul\u012bs were off their guard, and grass-\ncutters and water-carriers were going in and out as usual. M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n went in with all these common people.' So speaks the princess. The gentle-hearted governor was at the ham\u0101m, and was brought before K\u0101mr\u0101n, without time given to dress, and there and then sabred. The list of other cruelties and murders is too terrible reading for these pages, and the ensuing siege was full of barbarous acts. Hum\u0101y\u016bn crossed the passes as soon as it was practicable, and sat down to take the city. When K\u0101mr\u0101n saw at length that he could not hold it, he escaped through a hole fashioned in the wall, got through the trenches and away to the mountains. Some say Hind\u0101l let him pass the royal lines; others that H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n k\u016bka overtook him later (so destitute that he was being carried by a man), and that K\u0101mr\u0101n appealed to their milk-\nbrotherhood and was allowed to go free. He then joined his hereditary foes, the Uzbegs.\n\nIn 1548 Hum\u0101y\u016bn entered upon a campaign in Badakh-\nsh\u0101n which yielded interesting personal matters, such as this rivulet of the great stream of affairs can convey. He left K\u0101bul on June 12th, and \u1e24am\u012bda bore him company with Akbar as far as Gul-bih\u0101r. As governor this time a soldier, and a man enraged against K\u0101mr\u0101n, was left in charge of K\u0101bul. The campaign culminated in the capture of T\u0101liq\u0101n, which was made over on August 17th by K\u0101mr\u0101n, who was allowed to go to the refuge of all whose presence was undesired at home, Makka. Piety had no part in K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s intention to betake himself to the holy city, and when he had heard, with incredulous ears, that Hum\u0101y\u016bn was meting out mercy without justice to the revolted am\u012brs he had captured, he took heart and himself asked forgiveness. It is almost incredible, and would be quite so if one did not know Hum\u0101y\u016bn, that he was received with kettle-drums, trumpets, tears and pardon. Certainly Hum\u0101y\u016bn never deprived himself of the luxury of tears and the loose rein on his feelings. So wonderful was the following scene that Mr. Erskine\u2019s words shall tell\nit: 'When K\u0101mr\u0101n approached the Emperor, who was sitting in state in the pavilion of public audience, he took a whip from the girdle of Mu\u02bfnim Kh\u0101n, who stood by, and passing it round his neck, presented himself as a criminal. \"Alas, alas!\" exclaimed the Emperor, \"there is no need of this; throw it away.\" The m\u012brz\u0101 made three obeisances, according to the usual etiquette of the Court, after which the Emperor gave him the formal embrace and commanded him to be seated. K\u0101mr\u0101n began to make excuses for his past conduct and to express his regret. \"What is past is past,\" said the Emperor. \"Thus far we have conformed to ceremony; let us now meet as brothers.\" They then rose and clasped each other to their breasts in the most affectionate manner, and both burst into tears, sobbing aloud, so as to affect all present. Hum\u0101y\u016bn, on resuming his seat, desired his brother to sit next to him on the left, the place of honour, adding kindly in T\u016brk\u012b, the language of the family, \"Sit close to me.\" A cup of sherbet was brought, of which the Emperor, having drunk one half, handed it to his brother, who drank the other. A grand entertainment followed, at which the four brothers (also Sulaim\u0101n), who now met for the first time after a long separation, sat on the same carpet and dined, or, to use the words of the historian, ate salt together. The festival was prolonged for two days in the midst of universal rejoicing. As K\u0101mr\u0101n, from the rapidity and hurried nature of his return, had left his tents behind him on the road, the Emperor ordered a set to be pitched close to his own, and, at his desire, consented to \u1e24askar\u012b's going to stay with him.'\n\nFor this historic feast Gul-badan has provided a hors d'\u0153uvre in shape of a story of improper conduct in Sulaim\u0101n which, if it expressed derision, as her vague wording does not forbid to be read, was fully justified by both what had been and what was to come. It is a very funny little tale, and readers are commended to it.\n\nTo tears and professions were added lands and freedom. K\u0101mr\u0101n received K\u016bl\u0101b, where \u1e24aram Begam's father had\nonce ruled for B\u0101bar and Hum\u0101y\u016bn. He was now dead, and his son, Chakr \u2018Al\u012b, was left with K\u0101mr\u0101n there. The m\u012brz\u0101 was not pleased with his fief. \u2018What!\u2019 he exclaimed to the bearer of the deed of grant, \u2018have I not been king of K\u0101bul and Badakhsh\u0101n? K\u016bl\u0101b is a mere district of Badakhsh\u0101n. How can I serve in it?\u2019 The bearer observed that he had heard K\u0101mr\u0101n was wise, and begged permission to remind him that the wonder was he had received anything at all. \u2018\u0100skar\u012b, too, was given a fief, and then, leaving them neighbours and at large, Hum\u0101y\u016bn went back to K\u0101bul in October, 1548.\n\nA campaign was planned for 1549 against the Uzbegs and Balkh. This was done despite marked instability in the royal following. Instability or, in a plainer word, desertion, was an accident to which Hum\u0101y\u016bn was peculiarly liable. One cause of it is more interesting than the common one of personal gain, because it is rooted in theological bias. Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s coquetry with Shiism in Persia is one of the most entertaining of the episodes of his sojourn there, and it had consequences in arousing distrust of him, which cropped up from time to time. B\u0101bar himself had lost ground because of his tolerance to variety of faith. But to this, both in the father and still more in the son, were added, as causes of desertion, the flux and reflux of weak government which forbid men to know who will keep the upper hand and have power to oppress.\n\nTo return to the Balkh campaign: spring was waited for and there was delay for men. Spring came, and the minds of the ladies turned to thoughts of excursions out of town. They remarked more than once to Hum\u0101y\u016bn that the riw\u0101j would be coming up in the hills. This is a plant of subacid flavour which some say is like sorrel and some like rhubarb. It was, at least, a plant that people made excursions to eat, much as others go blackberrying. To these hints for change, the royal reply was that the army was going out; that it would pass by the Koh-i-d\u0101man (which is renowned for its riw\u0101j); and that the ladies should go too. Gul-badan must not be deprived of\nher story of the picnic, which illuminates the domestic ways of the court. The ladies went so far as to see the waterfall at Farza, and perhaps even to Ist\u016blif, twenty miles north of K\u0101bul, and then returned.\n\nThere had been bad omens for the start and there followed plenty of bad news from the front to fix attention on them. K\u0101mr\u0101n broke his promise to come to Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s help. Gul-chihra\u2019s second husband, an Uzbeg prince, ran away when he came to know that the army was directed against his people. There was an extraordinary retreat without an enemy, and of which the cause seems to have been fear that, as K\u0101mr\u0101n was not there, he was oppressing K\u0101bul. Hum\u0101y\u016bn was left almost alone, and the Uzbegs attacked and killed many fugitives. His horse was wounded and the whole affair was a fiasco. After all, too, when K\u0101bul was reached, there had been no sign of K\u0101mr\u0101n.\n\nIt was the expected that K\u0101mr\u0101n should not keep his word, but perhaps the unexpected was behind his conduct on the occasion of the Balkh campaign. Sulaim\u0101n and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm were with Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and their presence might well have kept him away, for Gul-badan tells of an incident in which the three men had part and which did not make them good company for one another. It is a bit of scandal to which Haram adds salt and vitality. It is repeated here because some little points do not quite stand clear in the begam\u2019s wording. While K\u0101mr\u0101n was in K\u016bl\u0101b\u2014i.e., his last holding,\u2014someone, who from her name of Tarkh\u0101n Begam must have been a woman of good birth, advised him to make love to Haram Begam. Good, she said, would come of it. So K\u0101mr\u0101n sent a go-between with a letter and a kerchief to Haram, who, furiously angry, at once summoned husband and son from wherever they were away from home, and told them of the advances made to her. She railed at Sulaim\u0101n, saying that it was clear he was thought a coward, and further observed that K\u0101mr\u0101n feared neither her nor her son. Much was packed in the pronoun here; there\nwas ground to fear the energetic and resolute woman who had the army of Badakhsh\u0101n at her disposal. She was a forceful person and had the go-between torn to pieces. K\u0101mr\u0101n was audacious, and his advances look the more so that \u1e24aram\u2019s sister was his wife; but they may have been made rather to the charms of her army than to those of its commandante.\n\nThe events of 1550 sum up in Jauhar\u2019s words: \u2018M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n wandered about the country with bad intentions.\u2019 In his course he surprised Hum\u0101y\u016bn in the Qibch\u0101q defile, and an engagement took place which was attended by great loss of life. It was witnessed by K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s wives and daughters from a commanding height. B\u0101yaz\u012bd mentions that the ladies wore turbans (dast\u0101r-basti), a detail which may have been suggested by the great heat of the weather. Why the women were on the scene is perhaps explained by a similar record in the Memoirs which concerns a wife of Sult\u0101n \u1e24usain B\u0101yqra. Shahr-b\u0101n\u016b, a daughter of Sult\u0101n Ab\u016b-sa\u02bf\u012bd M\u012brz\u0101, was, with \u1e24usain\u2019s other wives, present at a battle between her husband and her brother, Mahm\u016bd M\u012brz\u0101. She did not, as the other ladies did, leave her litter and mount a horse, so as to be ready for flight if necessary, but trusting to her brother, in the case of her husband\u2019s defeat, remained comfortably in her litter while the fight went on. This dispassionate composure so much offended \u1e24usain that he divorced her. Perhaps K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s family, too, had prepared for whatever was to be their fate by protecting themselves against the sun and by being ready to mount.\n\nIn this encounter Hum\u0101y\u016bn was badly wounded. Gulbadan was able to hear the details of the misadventure, because Khizr Khw\u0101ja was with her brother and, it may be said, fighting against his own, Yas\u012bn-daulat. Khizr and M\u012br Sayyid B\u012brka Tirmiz\u012b helped to hold the wounded man up on an ambling pony when he could not sit his horse, and so they led him out of the fray, sustaining his courage as they went by tales of other princes who had come through plights as bad. The wound was on the head,\nand was like one of B\u0101bar\u2019s in that it was given through a covering turban and this was uninjured. The pain was great and caused faintness. Hum\u0101y\u016bn took off his quilted coat and gave it to a servant. The man finding its weight an encumbrance, left it lying; it was taken to K\u0101mr\u0101n, who posted off with it to K\u0101bul, showed it as evidence of death, and once more took possession of the unfortunate city.\n\nJauhar has quaint stories of the destitution in which Hum\u0101y\u016bn now was, with his camp equipage lost and deprived of all necessaries. He was helped along through the night, cold and weakened, and in the morning was placed in safety by the arrival of a body of reliable troopers under H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad k\u016bka. He warmed himself in the sun, washed his wound, said his prayer kneeling on a scarlet stool, and borrowed a coat from a servant to replace his own, which was blood-stained. Then came an old woman of the place and offered him a pair of silk trousers, that he might discard his blood-stained ones. He accepted, while saying they were not fit for a man\u2019s wear, and remitted her taxes for life. This was drawing well in anticipation of the time when his account in those regions would stand to his credit.\n\nIt is said that while he sat with his face still to the qibla one of his followers, Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad qar\u0101w\u0101l, performed again for him the rite his father had observed, and expressed his willingness to die for him. Hum\u0101y\u016bn spoke reassuring words and comforted his faithful sacrifice.\n\nFor nearly three months K\u0101bul believed Hum\u0101y\u016bn dead. These words cover much feeling, sad and joyful; but there is no one to tell the truth and say whether it was thought by some to offer better hope of peace that Hum\u0101y\u016bn should be dead. There was always a large following of powerful officers ready to join K\u0101mr\u0101n, and one cannot suppose their changes in allegiance mere folly and fickleness. But no courtly author has told K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s side of the whole matter, nor his view of his own position.\n\nWith K\u0101bul Akbar came again into his uncle\u2019s hands.\nHe was kept safe through all the vicissitudes of his father\u2019s career, and was well cared for both by K\u0101mr\u0101n and by \u2019Askar\u012b. It has been said that on one occasion K\u0101mr\u0101n exposed him on the battlements of K\u0101bul to his father\u2019s guns, and this charge finds support from our princess. She however, it may be observed, makes no mention of the act attributed by some writers to M\u0101ham anaga, of interposing her own body to shield the child; indeed, she never once mentions this latterly influential woman. But this incident notwithstanding, it must be admitted that the boy was well treated. \u2019Askar\u012b\u2019s wife, who took charge of him after his capture at Quetta, is said to have been most kind to him.\n\nHe was entrusted by K\u0101mr\u0101n to Kh\u0101nz\u0101da, itself an act of surety and kindness. Again and again he fell into his uncle\u2019s hands when K\u0101mr\u0101n was exasperated by foiled attempts to keep K\u0101bul, and yet he survived. K\u0101mr\u0101n had a son; it would have surprised no one to learn that, as complement to his effort to oust Hum\u0101y\u016bn from his higher place, he had killed Akbar to give his own son more chance. In this there is what fixes attention in the same way that it is fixed by Gul-badan\u2019s record of K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s anxiety to obtain from the elder ladies of his house sanction to have the khutba read in his name. It was in his power to have himself proclaimed ruler in K\u0101bul, but he discussed his wish to be so proclaimed with the other members of the royal family before he did it, and the discussion was prolonged, and referred from Dil-d\u0101r to the greatest of the ladies, Kh\u0101nz\u0101da. In both these points there is something which, if better known, might mitigate the sweeping judgment usually passed upon K\u0101mr\u0101n as altogether wrong in all his doings.\n\nHum\u0101y\u016bn spent some time in Ander-\u0101b while his wound was healing and his army gathering, and here Haram comes again upon the scene. Where Sulaim\u0101n and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm were, is not quite clear, but it was to Haram a message went asking her for the army of Badakhsh\u0101n. It was to come as quickly as possible, and fully equipped. It took the energetic woman only a few days to put some thousands of\nmen in the field. It was she, says our princess, who did it all, took thought, and overlooked everything. Then she led the men to 'the pass,'\u2014amongst so many possible, one cannot fix on which,\u2014and having done her work, went home. It seems probable that Sulaim\u0101n and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm were already with Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and that \u1e24aram despatched a supplementary force. The battle in which it was to engage was that important fight at Ushtur-gram which Hum\u0101y\u016bn tried hard to prevent by previous mediation, and which was forced on by K\u0101mr\u0101n's chief officer, Qar\u0101cha Kh\u0101n.\n\nThere was much previous discussion as to terms of peace, but K\u0101mr\u0101n and Qar\u0101cha would have nothing less than K\u0101bul. A second embassy offered alliance of the 'unique pearl of the khil\u0101fat,' Akbar, with the m\u012brz\u0101's 'dear daughter' (who may be \u0100yisha), and that K\u0101bul should be theirs; and suggested that Hum\u0101y\u016bn and K\u0101mr\u0101n should join forces and again attack Hind\u016bst\u0101n. All came to nothing, because Qar\u0101cha cried, and enforced his cry, 'Our heads or K\u0101bul.' The battle that followed was a complete success for the royal arms, and to add to its good results, Akbar, of whose safety there had been doubt, was brought to Hum\u0101y\u016bn's camp. His father vowed charitable gifts for his restoration, and also that he would never part from him again.\n\nA pleasant chance befell Hum\u0101y\u016bn on the stricken field, for when he had claimed, as his share of booty, two driverless camels, he found in their loads his own books which he had lost at the Qibch\u0101q defile. Many would be MSS. of the Persian poets; B\u0101bar knew these well and often quotes the Gulist\u0101n; and Hum\u0101y\u016bn was too much of a dilettante and verse-lover not to have made himself familiar with their round.\n\nHappily the tale of the doings of K\u0101mr\u0101n is drawing to a close. He made a night attack, by which Hind\u0101l lost his life, on the royal forces on November 20th, 1551; sued for help in vain from S\u0101lim Sh\u0101h, the Emperor of Hind\u016bst\u0101n; from Adam Ghakkar, and was surrendered by him to Hum\u0101y\u016bn; was blinded by the insistence of the\nam\u012brs on August 17, 1553, and allowed to go to Makka. He was accompanied, as all the writers tell, by his Argh\u016bn wife M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak, and by her equal in compassion, a servant of Hum\u0101y\u016bn, Chilma Beg. He made the hajj four times and he died on October 5th, 1557. M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak survived him seven months. She only of his wives is commemorated as accompanying him to Makka, but I see no reason why others may not also be accepted as equally faithful. Her father opposed her going, and she roundly upheld her view of her duty and has been taken into the texture of history, but her co-wives may have gone unopposed and unpraised. How interesting K\u0101mr\u0101n might have made a book of Memoirs in which he set down his life from his own point of view, his motives, ambitions, opinions of right and wrong, and above all, if he had spoken his inner mind about the religious duties he was enabled to perform before death, through his defeat and mutilation! We do not know all the truth about him; certain crimes, of murder and of treachery after promise given, could never be palliated, but in the matter of possession of K\u0101bul there may be much brought forward which would place him rather in the position of the defender of rights than their assailant. He had no courtly chronicler, and has borne the blame of much that could plausibly be traced back to Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s own defects and their outcome of opportunity.\n\nTo end the story of the faithful brothers;\u2014\u2019Askar\u012b too received leave to go to Makka from Badaksh\u0101n in 1551; he died between that city and Damascus in 1558. Both he and K\u0101mr\u0101n thus lived long enough to see their house triumph again in India and their weary thwartings of its elder branch set at naught by the firmer hands of Akbar\u2019s chiefs. Of \u2019Askar\u012b one clear characteristic only comes out: he was true to the blood-tie with his mother\u2019s son and own senior, K\u0101mr\u0101n.\n\nA little return must now be made, in order to bring up the tale of home events to the date of those military. In 1551 the first marriage of the younger generation was arranged by the betrothal of Bakhshi-b\u0101n\u016b to Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, son\nof \u1e24aram. The Badakhsh\u012b trio had certainly deserved well of Hum\u0101y\u016bn and, while doing the best they could to strengthen their own position, had given him efficient help. It is good to tell all that is known of \u1e24aram. She seems to have had several daughters who played a part in public events as seals of alliance. When Hum\u0101y\u016bn had passed a short time of repose in K\u0101bul after his victory of Ushtur-gram, he sent to \u1e24aram to ask Sh\u0101hz\u0101da Kh\u0101nam, one of these girls, in marriage for himself. His envoys were two persons whom \u1e24aram did not consider worthy of their office. They were members of the royal household, and trusted members too, for one was Khw\u0101ja Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Ma\u1e25m\u016bd, m\u012br s\u0101m\u0101n,\u00b9 who, on Akbar\u2019s accession, was made commander of 2,500; and the other was Bibi F\u0101\u1e6dima, whom we know as having helped to nurse Hum\u0101y\u016bn in his illness of 1546.\n\n\u1e24aram, the dominant partner in the command of Badakhsh\u0101n, mother of a girl in whose veins was reputed to flow the blood of Alexander and of Tim\u016br, daughter of a tribal chief, and conscious of intrinsic claim to deference, inquired of the two lowly messengers why no begam or lady (\u0101gh\u0101cha) had come to prefer the royal request. She must have known that Hum\u0101y\u016bn could not mean to affront her; he had just given his daughter to her son and had testified gratitude for help in substantial ways to Sulaim\u0101n at the same time. She allowed herself to be mollified on condition that he himself should come to fetch his bride. The wedding does not seem to have taken place and the alliance was handed on to the next generation, in which, besides Ibr\u0101h\u012bm\u2019s, there was a betrothal of Mu\u1e25ammad Hak\u012bm to a daughter of \u1e24aram.\n\nWhile speaking of \u1e24aram and the alliances of her family with the royal house, there may be named a high-handed act about another quasi-royal marriage. One of\n\n\u00b9 This title is sometimes rendered \u2018butler,\u2019 but this is misleading, and a word not linked in English with intoxicants would be better. Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn it was who led Hum\u0101y\u016bn to give up the use of drugs, unfortunately late in life, by a gentle and forcible reproach.\nK\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s wives was Muhtar\u012bma Kh\u0101nam Chaghat\u0101i, and on his death Sulaim\u0101n wished to marry her. Of her as co-wife, \u1e24aram would not hear, and contrived to make her a daughter-in-law by marrying her to Ibr\u0101h\u012bm.\n\nThe death of Hind\u0101l in the night attack of K\u0101mr\u0101n, on November 20th, 1551, was a heavy blow to Gul-badan. She writes of it with feeling, and casts light on the question of rank in the affections of a Musalm\u0101n wife. She asks why her son or her husband was not killed rather than her brother. Perhaps she spoke out of feeling born of the fact that no dead father\u2019s son can be replaced, and from the deeps of family affection. Dutiful and admirable as were many of the wives of this time, the tie between the husband and a wife can never be so close as it is where the husband\u2019s affection is never a divisible factor in the household. Gul-badan shows that Musalm\u0101n\u012b affection centred on those of the same blood.\n\nThe royal ladies must have felt it hard when, after having mourned Hum\u0101y\u016bn through K\u0101mr\u0101n for nearly three months, Hind\u0101l was killed. This happened near Khizr Khw\u0101ja\u2019s fief of Jui-sh\u0101h\u012b, which explains why the body was sent there for burial and entrusted to the khw\u0101ja. It was removed later to K\u0101bul and laid at B\u0101bar\u2019s feet. Hind\u0101l was thirty-two years old, and left one daughter, Ruqaiya, who became the first wife of Akbar and survived him, a childless woman, to the age of eighty-four.\n\nUnfortunately for her readers, our begam\u2019s book ends abruptly (just after she has mentioned the blinding of K\u0101mr\u0101n,) in the only MS. of which we have knowledge, i.e., that belonging to the British Museum. The missing pages are a real loss. The narrative breaks off some three years before Akbar\u2019s accession, and for the future the best authority on our topics is silent. There is no occurrence of her own name in the histories until she goes to India in the first year of Akbar. Much of supreme importance happened to the royal family in the interval, and this makes regret the keener for the defective MS.\n\nSet free from the burden of his brothers, Hum\u0101y\u016bn\ndetermined, in 1554, to try his fortune again in Hindustan. He left K\u0101bul on November 15th,\u2014a date so near that of B\u0101bar\u2019s start in 1525 that it looks as if both obeyed the same omen of the heavens,\u2014and with Akbar dropped comfortably down the river from Jal\u0101lab\u0101d to Pesh\u0101war. The course of his advance beyond the Indus can be followed in Mr. Erskine\u2019s pages, and need not be repeated here. He was proclaimed Emperor in Dihl\u012b on July 23rd, 1555.\n\nA little-known episode of the time is the visit to India and the court of S\u012bd\u012b \u2018Al\u012b Reis, a Turkish admiral of Sulaim\u0101n the Great, who by the exigencies of war and weather found himself obliged to travel with a few officers and fifty sailors from S\u016brat to L\u0101h\u014dr and thence across all the wide intervening lands to Turkey.\\(^1\\) He was welcomed by Musalm\u0101ns for his master\u2019s sake, and he was offered appointments in India, all of which he refused. He was received with great honour by Sh\u0101h Husain Argh\u016bn, of whom he says that he had then reigned forty years, and had become so invalided during the last five that he could not sit his horse and used only boats for travel. Elsewhere it is said of Sh\u0101h Husain that he was subject to fever of such kind that he could live only on the river, and that he used to spend his time in going up and down from one extremity to the other of his territory in search of ease and health. Probably this is a detail of the admiral\u2019s remark. He heard of M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak (wife of Husain), whom he calls \u1e24aji Begam, as prisoner of \u012as\u0101 Tarkh\u0101n, and of her return to Husain. He heard, too, something which is not supported by other writers, namely, that she poisoned Husain, and that he died in consequence ten days after she rejoined him. The improbability of this story is shown by the fact that later on she conveyed Husain\u2019s body to Makka for interment, an act which would be incredible if the accusation of murder were true. Much that is interesting is told of the journey to the first place\n\n\\(^1\\) \u2018Travels and Adventures of S\u012bd\u012b \u2018Al\u012b Reis\u2019; Vamb\u00e9ry; Luzac and Co., 1899.\nwhere S\u012bd\u012b \u2018Ali\u2019s route brought him into contact with Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s people, i.e., L\u0101h\u014dr. He arrived early in August, shortly after the Restoration (July 23rd), and there awaited royal orders, because the governor would not let him go on until the Emperor had seen him. When one tries to picture one\u2019s self without telegrams or newspapers, one judges that a kindly-disposed am\u012br would endeavour to forward everyone who could tell a tale for the entertainment of the court. Hum\u0101y\u016bn sent for the admiral, and had him received, in the first half of October,\\(^1\\) outside Dihl\u012b by Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n-i-kh\u0101n\u0101n, other great am\u012brs, 1,000 men, and 400 elephants. He dined with the Kh\u0101n-i-kh\u0101n\u0101n, and was then introduced to the presence.\n\nAs was natural, the Emperor wished to keep his guest at court permanently, if possible, and if not this, then long enough to \u2018calculate solar and lunar eclipses, their degree of latitude and exact date, and to help the court astrologers to study the sun\u2019s course and the points of the equator.\u2019 What fastened interest on the Ottoman was that he learned to write verses in Chaghat\u0101i T\u016brk\u012b so well that Hum\u0101y\u016bn called him a second \u2018Ali Sh\u012br Naw\u0101\u012b. He had a turn for chronograms, too, and at his first audience presented one of the taking of Dihl\u012b, and made others subsequently which were admired. He was a clever man, and his literary aptitudes suited his royal host and the tone of the entourage. But he had other acquirements than those which ring well the change of words and obtained him his sobriquet of \u2018book-man,\u2019 and these others he used to bring about an agreement between the Emperor and his own former host,\n\n\\(^{1}\\) M. Vamb\u00e9ry makes the Emperor urge, as a reason for keeping the admiral, that they were \u2018now close upon\u2019 the rains. But it was October, and, moreover, Hum\u0101y\u016bn pointed out that the rivers were in flood and roads impassable. Perhaps this is a mistake of the admiral\u2019s, but still he saw the rivers, to his cost, in going to Dihl\u012b. Those who may read the interesting little book, for which thanks are due to M. Vamb\u00e9ry, need to accept it in other places also with some caution\u2014e.g., p. 38, Sultan Ma\u1e25m\u016bd Bhakkari is called \u1e24usain Argh\u016bn\u2019s adopted brother, and, p. 40, his father. He was a k\u016bka. Some of the mistakes may well be due to the difficulty of getting hold of a fact, and this especially on a journey. But cf. p. 43 n.\nSultan Mahmud Bhakkar\u012b. An official paper was drawn up, to which Humayun, literally, set his fist, for he dipped his clenched hand in saffron and laid it on the deed. Mahmud was much pleased, and both he and his vizier wrote their thanks to the mediator. This incident, and others too, gave occasion for other T\u00fcrk\u012b ghazels and higher praise. Sidi Ali was constantly in the royal circle, and there were contests in verse-making and dilettante amusements which reveal the true and newly-risen Huma once more at ease in untranquillized India. The traveller had not much to coax court favour with in the way of gifts, and this plumed his poetic flights; when he was wearied by his detention, he carried two ghazels to the royal seal-bearer and let them plead for his departure. They were heard, and he got 'leave to go,' with gifts and passport.\n\nHis affairs were all in order for his start when there happened the fatal accident which ended Humayun's life. That Humayun should die violently was in keeping with the violent changes of his career; and that he met his death in a building of Sh\u012br Sh\u0101h was a singular chance. His last hours of activity were filled by pleasant occupations; old friends had been seen who had just come back from Makka and would bring him news of both pilgrim brothers; letters had been read from home in K\u0101bul; he had gone up to the roof of the Sh\u012br Mandal, which he used as his library, and had shown himself to the crowd assembled below; then he had interested himself in the rising of Venus, with the object of fixing a propitious hour for a reception,\u2014perhaps to include the farewell of the Turkish guest.\n\nThe Sh\u012br Mandal is a two-storied building with flat roof in the middle of which rises a small cupola which looks like a shade from the sun. The roof is reached by two discontinuous, steep, and narrow flights of high and shallow granite steps, which are enclosed in walls and the upper one of which emerges through the roof. The Emperor on that Friday evening of January 24th, 1556, had started down the upper flight and was on its second step, when the mu'azzin raised the cry for prayer from the neighbouring mosque. Sidi\n'Ali says, as though it were some individual habit of Hum\u0101y\u016bn, that the latter had the custom of kneeling whenever he heard the cry; other writers say that he tried to seat himself. His foot became entangled, some say in his mantle (post\u012bn), his staff slid along the smooth step, and he fell to the bottom of the flight with severe injuries to head and arm. It is professed that a letter went after the fall from him to Akbar, but this may be a part of the well-meaning deception in which the dangerous nature of the injuries was shrouded; it would seem more probable from the admiral's account of the episode, which is silent as to any recovery of consciousness, that the injuries to the head were too severe to allow of restoration to sense. Three days later Hum\u0101y\u016bn died, on January 27th, and in the forty-eighth year of his age.\n\n'We come from God, and to Him we return,' and 'There is no guard against fate,' are the quoted comments of the Turkish admiral. He counselled that the death should be concealed until Akbar's return to Dihl\u012b, and brought forward experience drawn from his own country's similar circumstances. This was done and various fictions were composed. A man personated the dead Emperor in public audience, and there were rejoicings over his recovery from the fall. S\u012bd\u012b 'Al\u012b took leave of the grandees, and conveyed the false news of Hum\u0101y\u016bn's restoration to health in a friendly way along his route. By the time he reached L\u0101h\u016br he found that Akbar had been proclaimed, and his name read in the Friday prayers. Here, as before, the traveller had to wait for royal orders, because the governor had, or invented, useful orders for the crisis, that no one should pass to K\u0101bul. Then he was sent to the presence in Kilan\u016br, where Akbar honoured his father's passport and let the harassed and home-sick man continue his journey, with money for expenses and a strong escort to K\u0101bul.\n\nBefore bidding him good-bye on his still lengthy journey, it may be said that he and his four escorting begs and his sailors marched to Pesh\u0101war through the night to escape that\nAdam Ghakkar who had made over K\u0101mr\u0101n to Hum\u0101y\u016bn; that they saw two rhinoceroses, an event which makes one wonder whether there still remained a part of the ancient lake of the plain of Pesh\u0101war to serve as habitat for the huge and now vanished beasts; and that they crossed the many-memoried Khaibar.\n\nIn K\u0101bul the admiral saw Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s two sons, Mu\u1e25ammad Hak\u012bm and Farrukh-f\u0101l, who were born in the same month of 1553, one being the child of M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak and the other of Kh\u0101nish \u0101gh\u0101 Khuw\u0101rizm\u012b. This statement is a surprise, because B\u0101yaz\u012bd says that Farrukh died within a few days of birth. The admiral\u2019s information suggests an error in B\u0101yaz\u012bd\u2019s MS.\n\nS\u012bd\u012b \u1e24\u0101l\u012b found K\u0101bul beautiful and speaks of its snowy girdle, its gardens and its running water. He traced pleasure and merriment and feasting everywhere, and even instituted comparison between it and Paradise to the disadvantage of the latter. But he had no time for \u2018frivolities,\u2019 and thought only of hurrying home. He saw Mu\u02bfnim Kh\u0101n in the city, and being told by him that he could not cross the passes, observed that men had overcome mountains, and under the care of a local guide whose home was on the road, accomplished the feat with labour and safely. He took the road to T\u0101liq\u0101n and there saw our well-known friends, Sulaim\u0101n and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, but he is silent as to Haram. Here, too, he wrote and offered his ghazel, and was both welcomed and speeded. In T\u0101liq\u0101n we must leave him who has been a welcome new figure amongst familiar actors.\n\nSection III.\u2014Under Akbar.\n\nProtected by the capable men who upheld Akbar, the royal ladies had not again to flee before foes or to suffer violent change of fortune. Hum\u0101y\u016bn had planned their journey from K\u0101bul to India. Akbar more than once in his first year of rule had to cancel the orders he had given to effect it. Three military affairs disturbed the plan,\u2014the suppression of the revolt of Ab\u016b\u02bel-ma\u02bf\u0101l\u012b, the operations\nagainst Sikandar Afgh\u0101n, and the encounter with H\u012bm\u016b at P\u0101n\u012bpat. At length amirs were named to escort the ladies from K\u0101bul. The officers set out, but on their march received orders to act first against Sulaim\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101, who, on hearing of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s death, had come over from Badakhsh\u0101n to besiege K\u0101bul. This was the first of a series of his attempts on the city, to which he laid fanciful claim as head of the house of Tim\u016br after Hum\u0101y\u016bn. The approach of the imperial troops broke up his siege, and his claim having been accommodated by reading his name once in the khu\u1e6dba at K\u0101bul, he went home and left the ladies free to start.\n\nThey made their journey in time to arrive during the first quarter of 1557 near where lay the royal camp, at M\u0101nkot, in the western Sew\u0101liks. The Emperor came a stage from it to meet them, and was \u2018much comforted by the reunion.\u2019 With \u1e24am\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b Begam, to whom, as Empress-mother, the chief place must be assigned, were Gul-badan, Gul-chihra, \u1e24\u0101j\u012b, and Salima Begams. There was also a large company of officers\u2019 wives.\n\nPerhaps the ladies remained near the camp until it broke up and went to L\u0101h\u014dr. It left that city on its march for Dihl\u012b on December 7th, 1557; at Jalindhar it halted, and here, with pomp and amidst general interest, Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n-i-kh\u0101n\u0101n married Salima Sult\u0101n Begam, a granddaughter of B\u0101bar. She was a half-niece of Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and she had with Akbar cousinship of the \u2018four-anna\u2019 degree. B\u0101bar was their common ancestor, and their differing grandmothers diluted the cousinly relation.\n\nThis alliance had been arranged by Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and the use of sipurd\u0101n by Ab\u016b\u2019l-fa\u017cl when writing of it, shows that what was now celebrated was a marriage, and not a betrothal. This point is mentioned here because some writers fix Salima\u2019s age at this time as five, an estimate which is not supported by known facts of her life. The bride was probably a reward for the surpassing services done by Bair\u0101m for Hum\u0101y\u016bn, the newest being those of the Restoration. Bair\u0101m was a man to whom seems due the largesse\nof the hand of a king's daughter; he out-topped his contemporaries by his full stature in capacity, culture, faithfulness, and character. Sal\u012bma,\\(^1\\) though much his junior, was in other respects a fit wife for him. She was an educated woman; ranks amongst verse-makers so completely as to have a pen-name (takhallas), and stands out gently, by birth, character, and attainments.\n\nKhizr Khw\u0101ja Kh\u0101n had gone to Hind\u016bst\u0101n with Hum\u0101y\u016bn in 1554, and early in 1556 had been appointed by Akbar to the government of L\u0101h\u014dr. He was left to carry on operations against Sikandar Afgh\u0101n when Akbar was called away by Him\u016b's movements, and he was defeated. The few words said about him give the impression that he was not a good soldier, and he is never again named in responsible command. The slight things recorded of him point to subsequent comfortable existence at court as the 'husband of the Emperor's aunt, Gul-badan Begam.' Once he made a gift of horses to Akbar; in 1563 he helped to nurse Akbar when the latter was wounded in Dihl\u012b; and there is no record of his death. He was raised to high military rank, and at some time was am\u012bru-l-umara', but the \u0100in-i-akbar\u012b does not place him in its list of man\u1e63abd\u0101rs. He stands twelfth in the general list of the \u1e6cabaq\u0101t, and amongst the chiefs of 5,000.\n\nFrom her coming to India in 1557 to the time of her pilgrimage in 1574, our princess is not mentioned by the historians. The interval held much of deep interest to her and to others of her generation whose lives were slipping away under the safeguarding of Akbar. Some survivors of an older day, witnesses of Bair\u0101m's fidelity to Hum\u0101y\u016bn, must have felt his downfall keenly. Ham\u012bda can hardly have been ignorant of the intrigue which brought this about, because she was related to the chief actors in it,\u2014M\u0101ham anaga, Adham Kh\u0101n, and Shih\u0101bu-d-d\u012bn A\u1e25mad\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The histories have a definite statement about her descent which yet presents difficulties when looked into. Its points are considered in the Appendix, s.n. Sal\u012bma.\nNish\u0101p\u016br\u012b. The last was governor of Dihli, where she lived, and part of the scheme to separate Akbar from Bair\u0101m took him to Dihli to see her, and thus under the eye of Shih\u0101b. \u1e24am\u012bda must have had clear in memory the truly valid services done for her husband by Bair\u0101m during the Persian exile. The plot had its nucleus in a sayyid circle and in families religious by inheritance, and it was carried out at the point of the tongue. Mu\u1e25ammad B\u0101q\u012b Kh\u0101n k\u016bka, the anaga\u2019s elder son, does not appear as taking part in it. He served the Emperor till 1584, rose to be a chief of 3,000, and of his character nothing is known. His younger brother, Adham, although put to death in 1562, had become chief of 5,000. All that is said of him is bad, and he, like his mother, was fluent in detraction and did all in his power to poison the mind of Akbar against the worthiest of his am\u012brs.\n\nMany comments have been made upon M\u0101ham anaga, both by the Persian writers and by their European commentators. Ab\u016b\u2019l-fa\u017cl calls her a cupola of chastity, and it is now possible to wipe from her reputation the stain suggested by Professor Blochmann when writing of the parentage of Adham. She was wife of Nad\u012bm-Kh\u0101n k\u016bka, a faithful servant of Hum\u0101y\u016bn. This fragment of useful information was brought to light by Mr. Beveridge, who found it in a MS. of Colonel Hanna, which may yield other valuable matter on quasi-domestic points. M\u0101ham anaga may be granted the praise she deserves as a nurse who earned the affection of Akbar to the end of her life; she is entitled to such praise as belongs to a mother who screens a son\u2019s every fault and pushes his fortunes with all her influence. She must take the dispraise of not pushing her elder son\u2019s as she did Adham\u2019s. B\u0101yaz\u012bd b\u012by\u0101t speaks of her as kind to him, and tells little stories which show her the centre of small affairs. I have not discerned in her any sign of talent. Whatever influence Akbar\u2019s affection gave her would be strengthened by her connection with his mother, and perhaps, too, with other women who were descended from A\u1e25mad J\u0101m\u012b. Amongst these was H\u0101ji\nBegam, Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s widow and a person much regarded by the Emperor.\n\nIn the year following Bair\u0101m\u2019s death, Adham Kh\u0101n, who, says the \u1e6cabaqat, held a place higher than the other courtiers because he was his mother\u2019s son, was on duty in M\u0101lwa against B\u0101z Bah\u0101dur S\u016br. Incidents resulted which emphasize regret that for such as the actors in them Bair\u0101m had had to make way. M\u0101ham anaga was de facto prime minister; Mu\u2019nim Kh\u0101n had been made Kh\u0101n-i-khan\u0101n, and it was looked for by his friend the anaga that he should become prime minister de jure. B\u0101z Bah\u0101dur was defeated and fled from S\u0101rangpur. Aping the Hind\u016bs, he had ordered his servants to kill the women of his household in the event of his defeat. Several had been so killed, many had been wounded, when the sacrifice was interrupted by the imperialists under Adham. Bad\u0101yuni says that there followed slaughter by Adham and his colleague, Pir Muhammad Kh\u0101n, of terrible extent, and his own eyes saw that these two regarded God\u2019s creation in mankind as leeks, cucumbers, and radishes,\u2014a quaint turn of words which covers awful butchery. When remonstrated with in the name of the law, the murderers asked what was to be done with so many prisoners.\n\nIf the order for the death of the women of B\u0101z Bah\u0101dur\u2019s household had issued from a R\u0101jp\u016bt heart, there would have been no need for executioners while he was in flight. The victims were, however, not R\u0101jp\u016btn\u012bs, and they suffered only to gratify the vanity of a Moslim. Amongst those wounded was R\u016bp-mati, a dancing-girl renowned throughout Hind\u016bst\u0101n for beauty, singing, and poetic gifts. Her name seems that of a Hind\u016b. Her wounds, inflicted by B\u0101z Bah\u0101dur\u2019s order, were severe and she wished to die. Adham let her know that, if she would care for herself, he would send her to her master when she could travel. She took his promise as true, had her wounds dressed and recovered. When she claimed fulfilment of Adham\u2019s word, she was told to consider herself as his slave. He entered her room, raised her veil, and saw her dead by her own act.\nPerhaps the point of deepest social degradation in this story is that R\u016bp-mat\u012b was, by men\u2019s decree, born to sin without blame, and yet she died because she loved one man. Her heart was single, and yet she was only the most charming, clever and beautiful of a crowd of dancing-girls, purchased slaves, to whom no man\u2019s loyalty and no mercy were thought due.\n\nAdham Kh\u0101n took much booty from B\u0101z Bah\u0101dur, and he disregarded the rule which required the choicest part to be sent to the Emperor; he also comported himself more like an independent ruler than a king\u2019s lieutenant. This angered Akbar, and he hurried off to S\u0101rangpur, outdistanced a messenger of M\u0101ham anaga whom she had sent with warnings, and took Adham by surprise. She herself came in next day and counselled surrender of the spoil. This and other matters having been adjusted, the Emperor started for his capital. No sooner was he gone than Adham, with his mother\u2019s connivance, regained possession of two of the most coveted of the captive women. News of this went after Akbar, who ordered them to be returned to the royal camp. When they came again within her power, the anaga had them murdered, so that they might not tell the tale of their abduction.\n\nHaving spent so many years under the influence of M\u0101ham anaga, it is to the credit of Akbar\u2019s humanity and mental force that there are not more than the recorded blots on his scutcheon; at nineteen he rebelled against his nurse, when she had set his feet on the primrose path to ruin of person and empire. He did not punish the murder of the captive girls, but he soon manifested his intention to depose his nurse and her son from power. Instead of appointing their friend Mu\u2019nim prime minister, he summoned his foster-father, Shamsu-d-d\u012bn Al\u1e25mad Ghaznav\u012b and gave him the post. Shamsu-d-d\u012bn was an unlettered man, but he was staunch and had sons who were true to J\u012b-J\u012b anaga\u2019s nursling.\n\nThe next episode in which M\u0101ham anaga and her son appear, was one to shake the home fabric to its foundations,\nfor Adham murdered Shamsu-d-d\u012bn, bursting in upon him as he sat in business audience and unsuspicious. It was done on the night of May 16th, 1562. The incident is well known, how the murderer rushed to the haram door and on the appearance of Akbar began to palliate his crime, but was struck down by a blow of the royal fist and then killed by royal order.\\(^1\\)\n\nIt was the Emperor who told M\u0101ham anaga of her son\u2019s death: \u2018M\u0101m\u0101! we have killed Adham,\u2019 are the words put into his mouth by B\u0101yazid. She fell ill from anger and grief; this blow shattered her heart\u2019s idol and her ambition for him and herself. Bad\u0101yun\u012b says that she died after having presented the food of the fortieth day of mourning, and this points to her belief that the souls of the dead take final departure from earth on that day and after partaking of the food of their choice which the care of relations sets for them. Mother and son were buried in one spot, and Akbar placed his shoulder under his nurse\u2019s bier in sign of his sentiment to her.\n\nQuite stirring news for discussion through some years, amongst the elder ladies of the royal family, would be the conduct of M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak Begam in K\u0101bul. She was the last recorded wife of Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and was married in 1546, after the coming of \u1e24am\u012bda from Qandah\u0101r to K\u0101bul. She was not a woman of birth,\u2014one gathers a general impression that few royal wives married late in life were so,\u2014and her title of begam was probably owed to her having borne a son, Mu\u1e25ammad Hak\u012bm. In 1554 Hum\u0101y\u016bn had left her three-years-old boy as nominal governor of K\u0101bul under charge of Mu\u02bfnim Kh\u0101n, and in 1556 Akbar had confirmed the appointment. When Mu\u02bfnim went to court in 1561,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Some writers put into Akbar's mouth, when he addressed Adham, an epithet which would imply baseness in his birth and opprobrium of his mother; but I am advised that from various considerations weight need not be given to the inference of the word, which, moreover, is not used by all the sources. The point is mentioned here because of the contradiction involved in the epithet with the statement of marriage with Nad\u012bm k\u016bka, and with the terms of respect employed towards the anaga by the Persian writer who uses the degrading epithet.\nhis son Ghani became his locum tenens, but Ghan\u012b had neither 'suavity nor sense,' and the begam shut him out of K\u0101bul, one morning when he had gone to walk in the melon gardens. He went to India, and she took up the guidance of her boy's affairs. She chose three men to help her; two soon came by their deaths at her dictation, and the third became supreme. Akbar, and no doubt the ladies also, heard of these doings, and despatched Mu'nim Kh\u0101n with men to put things straight. M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak met Mu'nim at Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d, utterly defeated him, and he fled to court. She then killed the last adviser of her trio and took another, whom she may have married, named Haidar Q\u0101sim Kohbur. These proceedings surprise one in M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak, and bring her story down to the first half of 1564, when Ab\u016b'l-ma'\u0101l\u012b appears upon her stage.\n\nWe cannot enter here into the previous history of Ab\u016b'l-ma'\u0101l\u012b,\u2014his rebellions, murders, imprisonment, pilgrimage, and reinvigorated return to wickedness. He now came to K\u0101bul fresh from two assassinations in Hind\u016bst\u0101n, a fugitive, and indited a letter to the ruling begam, with profession of affection and devotion to the memory of Hum\u0101y\u016bn. She welcomed him, gave him her little daughter Fakhru-n-nis\u0101' in marriage, and let him take the lead. Before long he stabbed M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak with his own hand, murdered Haidar Q\u0101sim, and stirred revolt against himself which led to woeful slaughter within the walls of K\u0101bul. Word of all this went from Muhammad Hak\u012bm to Sulaim\u0101n and Haram, with a prayer for help. Haram approving and accompanying, the army of Badakhsh\u0101n marched over the passes, met Ab\u016b'l-ma'\u0101l\u012b in the Ghurband valley, captured him, and sent him bound to the prince, who had him strangled. Both he and Adham Kh\u0101n had justified Bair\u0101m's distrust, which had prompted him to wish their death early in Akbar's reign.\n\nA little story of Haram may be inserted here, somewhat after date. She had not been always on perfect terms with Sulaim\u0101n. Not only, a little earlier, had there been.\nthe discussion between them of his wish to take Muhtar\u012bma to wife, which Haram had frustrated by marrying the khan\u0101m to Sulaim\u0101n\u2019s son instead of to himself, but she had been angered extremely by the murder of one of her brothers by her husband and her son. She took the resolution of deserting Sulaim\u0101n and went over to K\u0101bul, where then Mu\u02bfnim Kh\u0101n was governor, and she had meant to carry on her complaints to Akbar. Mu\u02bfnim, however, who had been begged to mediate by Sulaim\u0101n, gave her good advice and pacified her, so that at last she consented to return to Badakhsh\u0101n. He rode out to bid her farewell; she bade her camel kneel and dismounted; he got off his horse, and there was exchange of friendly greeting. She told him she regarded him as a brother and that for his sake she would never bring the army of Badakhsh\u0101n against K\u0101bul. It came several times later and with her approval, but Haram could swear and break even \u2018awful oaths.\u2019 B\u0101yaz\u012bd b\u016by\u0101t accompanied her to the Ghurband and was charmed by her suavity and agreeableness.\n\nOn the death of Abu\u02bfl-ma\u02bf\u0101l\u012b, Sulaim\u0101n sent home for a daughter and married her to Mu\u1e25ammad Hak\u012bm, partitioned out some of the lands of K\u0101bul to his own people, and went home to Qila-i-zafar. Irritation against the interlopers led to their expulsion by the K\u0101bul\u012bs, and this brought the Badakhsh\u012b forces again to K\u0101bul, in 1564. Mu\u1e25ammad Hak\u012bm hurried to the Indus and complained to his big brother and Sulaim\u0101n was made to retreat.\n\nIn 1566 he and Haram and their girls were again before the coveted K\u0101bul, and on this occasion Haram tried to supplement their failing military action by treachery. She got Sulaim\u0101n to lay an ambush for Mu\u1e25ammad Hak\u012bm, whom, with \u2018awful oaths\u2019 of amity, she had persuaded to have a meeting with her under profession of desire to adopt him now that her son Ibr\u0101h\u012bm was dead. The end of this affair was, in net result to the Badakhsh\u012bs, nothing; Haram went home and Sulaim\u0101n followed. With them went the unfailing daughters, of whom Haram seems to have had many, or who were betrothed and not\n\u2018entrusted,\u2019 so many recorded times. They had been near capture by the K\u0101bul\u012bs in the Four-walled Garden, but the commandant of the city recalled his men and let the girls go free, because he did not think it seemly to capture women.\n\nThis is not the place to follow Sulaim\u0101n\u2019s interesting fortunes to their close, under Akbar\u2019s protection, by death in L\u0101h\u014dr in 1589. For our purpose, it is enough to say that he held Badakhsh\u0101n so long as Haram\u2019s watchful eye was on him, and lost it at her death. It was Muhtar\u012bma\u2019s son, Sh\u0101h-rukh, his own grandson, who turned him out of his beloved Badakhsh\u0101n, and in this, too, there may be Haram\u2019s hand. Muhtar\u012bma would not be likely to teach her boy dutiful conduct to Haram or to Haram\u2019s husband, for the two women were foes, and Haram had tried to separate Muhtar\u012bma from her son, and to expel her from Badakhsh\u0101n to her parental home in K\u0101shghar. If Haram had lived, her pride would have found content in two alliances of her grandson with daughters of the royal blood,\u2014one a child of Mu\u1e25ammad Hak\u012bm, and the other of Akbar himself.\n\nThe ill-behaviour of \u1e24am\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b\u2019s brother, Khw\u0101ja Mu\u2019azzam, must have been a frequent annoyance to the inner circle of the elder ladies at court. From boyhood he had been fantastic and mischievous, and perhaps carried always the germ of the madness which overtook his last years. Bair\u0101m, the sensible, had exiled him, then had given him some countenance; on Bair\u0101m\u2019s fall he had received a fief, and, so far, had been favoured. But Akbar did not like him, and the murders he had committed were sufficient to warrant dislike. He was a true parvenu, assertive and relying on his sister to excuse his faults. \u1e24am\u012bda had been conscious before her marriage that her lowly birth was a point against her wedding with Hum\u0101y\u016bn. The disparity in her case, as in other misalliances of the time, had raised unworthy people to power. Now, in 1564, Bibi F\u0101\u1e6dima lamented to Akbar that Khw\u0101ja Mu\u2019azzam had threatened to kill his wife Zuhra, who was\nher daughter. The Emperor consequently sent the khw\u0101ja word that he was coming to his house, and followed the message closely. As he entered, the khw\u0101ja stabbed Zuhra and then flung his knife, like a challenge, amongst the royal followers. Ab\u016b'l-fa\u017cl says that for punishment the murderer was flung into the river, but 'would not drown.' The more sensible Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn Ahmad says he was beaten and then soused in the river. He died insane, in prison, at Gu\u0101li\u0101r. All the shortcomings and crimes of the man notwithstanding, \u1e24am\u012bda must have cherished some warmth of feeling for the tricksy boy who had lifted suspicion from her in the matter of the stolen rubies of the Persian episode.\n\nIn 1571 another old acquaintance comes to the front in the person of N\u0101h\u012bd Begam, in whom our princess must have maintained interest for the sake of her father Q\u0101sim, B\u0101bar's foster-brother. N\u0101h\u012bd, as has been said earlier, was the daughter of Q\u0101sim and of M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak Argh\u016bn, who must not be confounded with K\u0101mr\u0101n's wife of the same name, one common amongst the Argh\u016bn women of the time. She had married Mu\u1e25ibb-\u02bfal\u012b, son of Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn \u02bfAl\u012b Khal\u012bfa Barl\u0101s, and who had risen to high military rank but now lived remote from soldiering and in reposeful retirement. N\u0101h\u012bd's mother was now in her (third) widowhood for \u02bf\u012as\u0101 Tarkh\u0101n Argh\u016bn, and she was not well regarded by her last husband's son, Mu\u1e25ammad B\u0101q\u012b Tarkh\u0101n Argh\u016bn, the ruler of Tatta. N\u0101h\u012bd, in 1571, went to see her mother, and perhaps conveyed to B\u0101q\u012b the impression that her visit was something more than filial. He put M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak in prison, and so behaved to N\u0101h\u012bd that she hurried off to court and made bitter complaint of her own wrongs and of the rudeness shown to the royal attendants who had been with her in Sind. She told Akbar, too, that she had talked with Sultan Ma\u1e25mud Bhakkar\u012b, that old retainer of Sh\u0101h \u1e2ausain who had kept the island-fort against Hum\u0101y\u016bn in the forties, and for whom S\u012bdi \u02bfAl\u012b Reis had negotiated terms in 1555. Ma\u1e25m\u016bd had suggested an attack on Tatta, and, supported by him,\nN\u0101hid pleaded for help from Akbar to act against B\u0101q\u012b. She was very keen about her plan and persuaded the Emperor to give men and money.\n\nMu\u1e25ibb-\u02bfal\u012b was disturbed from his repose, and put at the head of the force. With him went N\u0101hid and also a wife named S\u0101mia and her son, Muj\u0101hid. For N\u0101hid\u2019s ends the long war that followed was infructuous. An amusing episode of it was that S\u0101mia, when things did not go as she wished, went into rebellion against Akbar, and actually held an entrenchment against the royal amirs a day and a night. In the end, Mu\u1e25ibb-\u02bfal\u012b obtained a comfortable town appointment and nothing more is heard of the ladies. Probably they too accommodated themselves to the tolerant and forgiving atmosphere of Akbar\u2019s court.\n\nNi\u1e93\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn Al\u1e25mad is somewhat more sober of diction than his fellow-penmen and so, when he says that the Gujr\u0101t campaign of 1572 caused the royal ladies joy enough to last their lives, whole-hearted delight is pictured. This was the campaign which made beautiful S\u012bkr\u012b the City of Victory (F\u0101\u1e6dh-p\u016br). Round one incident of the war womanly interest,\u2014and surely compassion also,\u2014will have centred. The veil of historic silence lifts for a brief moment, and shows Gul-rukh, K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s daughter, in flight with her son.\n\nGul-badan\u2019s long span of unchronicled life was probably spent in the peaceful occupation of a wife and mother, with variety from books, verse-making, festivities, and outside news. She must have found much to exercise her lively mind in Hind\u016bst\u0101n. That she went about with the royal camp is shown by the record of the place assigned to her tent in the encampments. It was pitched next to \u1e24am\u012bda\u2019s, well within the great enclosure, and not far from the Emperor\u2019s own. Since she was a woman, she must have found food for observation in the doings and position of her sex under the conditions of their life in Hind\u016bst\u0101n. How did sat\u012b look to her? What did she think of the j\u016bhar? Both these Hind\u016b customs were far different from those of\nher traditions in similar crises. She came of a tribe which boasts of the fidelity of its wives to the marriage tie. All the women of her house must have heard of the defiant act of A\u012bs-daulat, B\u0101bar\u2019s grandmother, who had ordered her maids to stab a man to whom her captor had given her, and who then, for sole excuse, had observed that she was the wife of Y\u016bnas Kh\u0101n. Gul-badan had also in her own family history plenty of examples of the fate of captured girls, for many of her kinswomen had married foes of their tribe; and many too had become contented wives, well treated, and remaining in their foreign homes apparently without constraint.\\(^1\\)\n\nWhat Tim\u016brid women saw amongst the Hind\u016bs reveals another type of virtue and another standard of wedded life. Our princess must have heard something on the topic through her father\u2019s experience when she was a child. Wifehood and motherhood now gave her better insight into the problems which underlie social relations. She would hear that Rajp\u016btn\u012bs died joyfully rather than be captured; that outmatched R\u0101jp\u016bts killed wives and children and went to certain death themselves,\u2014a holocaust to honour. The early years of Akbar furnished plenty of such records.\n\nHow, one would like to know, did the Musalm\u0101n\u012b regard the willing death by fire of the Hind\u016b widow, in that exaltation which lifts thought above pain and terror and is admirable, whether in the martyr for faith or for wifely duty? Unfortunately, the barriers of language and habit must have kept Akbar\u2019s R\u0101jp\u016bt wives from charming the Musalm\u0101n\u012b ladies by recital of the legends of their race. These Hind\u016bs can never have been welcome inmates of the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I think, and the impression is gathered from the Memoirs, that although women and children were often murdered by victorious soldiers, wives were often returned to their husbands or families, and that enforced marriage was usually with the defeated leader\u2019s daughters. Perhaps the Muhammadan law of divorce helped the wives. Injustice might easily be done under the rough-and-ready expectation that family ties would be set at naught by conquerors who were Muhammadans. There was certainly diversity of action and of degree of mercy and chivalry.\npalace to any of the Moslims; but, pagan as they were thought, their conduct as wives must have insinuated the thin edge of conviction that to no one form of faith is committed the nurture of the sense of duty.\n\nOne common thought Gul-badan and the rest could have shared with the Hind\u016b ladies,\u2014that of the duty of pilgrimage and of respect for holy places. When next history concerns itself with our begam, it is to tell of her setting out, in 1575, for Makka. The Emperor had been unwilling to part with her, and it may be, even, had delayed with the thought of accompanying her. His heart was now much set upon making the hajj, but he did no more than walk a short distance with a caravan from \u0100gra, dressed in the seamless wrapper of the Arabian ceremonies. Though debarred from leaving Hind\u016bst\u0101n himself, he helped many others to fulfil this primary duty of their faith, and opened wide his purse for their expenses. Each year he named a leader of the caravan, and provided him with gifts and ample funds. Sult\u0101n Khw\u0101ja, Gul-badan\u2019s cicerone, took, amongst other presents, 12,000 dresses of honour. He did not bring her home again; this duty fell to Khw\u0101ja Yahy\u0101 (John). What circumstance extorted royal consent to Gul-badan\u2019s absence is not recorded; her advancing age,\u2014she was past fifty,\u2014and her dislike of the laxity in opinion and practice in matters of the Faith would add warmth to her request for leave to go.\n\nAb\u016b\u2019l-fa\u017cl has preserved the names of the chief ladies of the pilgrim party, but many others went with Gul-badan Begam, and for all the royal purse bore the cost. She was the lady of highest birth, and was probably a widow; next came Sal\u012bma Sult\u0101n Begam, widow of Bair\u0101m and wife of Akbar. It was not usual for a wife to make the pilgrimage, but Mu\u1e25ammadan law stipulates that permission shall be granted to such wives as strongly desire to do so, and Sal\u012bma\u2019s seems a case in point. Next comes a woman whose presence reveals pleasant things. She was Sult\u0101nam, widow of Akbar\u2019s uncle, \u2019Askar\u012b, and of her it is recorded in Akbar\u2019s babyhood that she cared for him when\ncaptured, with tender affection. It is probable that she had spent many years under the care and at the cost of the Emperor. Then come two step-nieces of Gul-badan, daughters of K\u0101mr\u0101n,\u2014\u1e24\u0101j\u012b and Gul-\u2018iz\u0101r Begams. I do not know which child of his is veiled under the title of \u1e24\u0101j\u012b. She seems to be making her second haj, and may well have gone on her first when her father was in Arabia. To these two the pilgrimage would have humanly pious significance, as a visitation to their father\u2019s tomb and to that of M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak Argh\u016bn, whom all his children must have held in reverence. Next comes a grand-daughter of Gul-badan herself, named Um-k\u016blsum (Mother of Plumpness), presumably after the daughter of her Prophet. Whether she was the child of Sa\u2018\u0101dat-y\u0101r is not said, nor whether the last name on the list, Sal\u012bma Kh\u0101nam, is that of a child of Gul-badan, as well as of Khizr Khw\u0101ja Kh\u0101n. Here some of the inconveniences of polygamy show themselves to the seeker after family facts.\n\nAn old associate of our princess accompanied her in the person of Gul-n\u0101r \u0101gh\u0101cha, who had been of B\u0101bar\u2019s household and was, I think, one of the two Circassians sent as a present to him by Sh\u0101h T\u0101hm\u0101sp in 1526. She was now well on her way through life and considerably older than Gul-badan Begam. Another of the party had also been of B\u0101bar\u2019s household, Bib\u012b Sar\u016b-qad, or Sar\u016b-i-sah\u012b (Straight Cypress). She had been, too, in Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s service and later had married, with full nisbat, Mu\u2018nim Khan-i-khanan. She was a widow, had been a singer and reciter, and was a \u2018reliable woman.\u2019 Like her in accomplishments were Bib\u012b Safiya and Sh\u0101ham \u0101gh\u0101, both formerly of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s household. Of the first and of Bib\u012b Sar\u016b-qad we have the happy little record that they sang in the moonlight on the road to Laghm\u0101n in 1549.\n\nFathp\u016br-sikr\u012b seems to have been the rallying-point of the caravan and October 15th, 1575, the day of departure from it. It started earlier than was usual, perhaps because the ladies could not travel fast. Caravans generally left \u0100gra in the tenth month\u2014this left in the seventh\u2014of the\nMu\u1e25ammadan year. Akbar\u2019s second boy, Mur\u0101d, was told off to escort the ladies to the coast. S\u0101lim met them one stage out to give last greetings. At Gul-badan\u2019s request, Mur\u0101d was excused from his long task of escort to S\u016brat, and he went back to \u0100gra. One smiles to find that the princes were five and four years old. The real charge of the caravan was with several am\u012brs, one being Mu\u1e25ammad Baq\u012b Kh\u0101n k\u016bka, and another R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n of Aleppo, who may have been B\u0101bar\u2019s artillery officer.\n\nIt is a real loss that there is no record of the journey from our begam\u2019s pen. It was to be adventurous; even perilous; and it was of great interest whether as sightseeing travel or pious duty. S\u016brat was the port of embarkation, but there are no details of the road taken to reach it. Father Rudolf Acquaviva passed between the same two terminal points in 1580, but the military movements of the interval may well have allowed him to travel where the ladies could not go. When they were first in S\u016brat, it had been a royal possession for two years only, and even when the Father took the fairly direct route from it to Fat\u1e25pur-sikr\u012b, the R\u0101jp\u016bt peasantry was in arms against their new lord. The ladies were probably handed on from one garrisoned place to another as the immediate circumstances of conquest dictated. The main body of their haj joined them by a tedious and weary route, first escorted through Goganda by the army which was on active service, and then passing on to A\u1e25mad\u0101b\u0101d, and, perhaps by water, to S\u016brat.\n\nThe governor of the port, who was to have a good deal of trouble with this caravan, was Qulij Kh\u0101n Andij\u0101nt\u012b, a sobriquet of pleasant sound in our begam\u2019s ears. He had inherited Tim\u016brid service from many generations, and his father had been a grandee of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n \u1e24usain B\u0101yqr\u0101.\n\n\u2018There was peace with the isles of the Franks,\u2019 but it took the ladies a year to get to sea. The Akbar-n\u0101ma attributes some part of the delay to a foolish panic about the Firing\u012bs which, after the ladies had embarked in their hired Turkish transport, the Sal\u012bm\u012b, seized the other\npilgrims who were to sail in the royal ship, the *Ilahi*. The real ground appears to have been want of a pass. The Portuguese were then masters of the Indian waters, and no ship might dare to put to sea without toll paid and pass obtained. Alarm about the Portuguese was natural, for there were stories that the very pass was sometimes a letter of Bellerophon enjoining capture and death. Ab\u016b\u2019l-fa\u017cl says that, although the ladies embarked, they were unwilling to put out and desert their fellow-pilgrims. This may be mere broidery, or the one ship may have had a pass and the other not. Perhaps, too, as theirs was a hired transport, it was also one privileged to sail free. However this may be, Bad\u0101yuni makes the difficulty clear by saying that Khw\u0101ja Sult\u0101n\u2019s ships lay idle from want of the pass. He also, it may be added, quotes a legal opinion that at this time it was not lawful to make the *haj* from India because, of the two practicable routes, one lay through the Shiah country of \u1e24Iraq, and the other obliged a pass which bore the idolatrous stamp of the heads of the Virgin Mary and of Jesus Christ (\u2018on whom be peace\u2019).\n\nThe *m\u012br haj* sent word to the Emperor of his plight, who at once despatched orders to Qulij Kh\u0101n, in \u012adar, to go to S\u016brat and arrange the difficulty. Qulij took with him a Cambayan, who was presumably a man versed in seafaring business,\u2014hurried to S\u016brat and overcame the difficulty.\n\nIt took the ladies a year to get to sea; they sailed on October 17th, 1576. Their port of debarkation is not mentioned; some pilgrims sailed by the Arabian, some by the Persian Gulf. They spent three and a half years in Arabia, and were able to make the *haj* four times.\n\nSome day perhaps a pious and enlightened Musalm\u0101n will set down the inner meaning he attaches to the rites of the pilgrimage. How interesting it would have been if our princess had told us what it was in her heart that carried her through the laborious duties of piety she accomplished during her long stay in her holy land! She might have given us an essential principle by which to interpret the\nreligious meaning which devout women attach to the rites commanded on the pilgrimage.\n\nThe visitation duties are set down in Hughes\u2019 \u2018Dictionary of Isl\u0101m,\u2019 where even their brief recital is attractive and adds to the wish of gauging the sentiment of believers in their efficacy. The acts prescribed are exhausting, not only to the body but also, one thinks, to the mind, because the very conception of the pilgrimage as a Divine ordinance keeps brain and heart tense, as all obedience does which sets the human will parallel to the Divine.\n\nThe mere recapitulation of the prescribed ceremonies is impressive: The halt six miles from the city to put on the seamless wrapper (ihr\u0101m); the chanting of the pilgrim song; the prayer of intention and of supplication for grace to make the visitation duly; the contemplation, touch, and salutation of the mystic black stone; the sevenfold encompassment of the ka\u2018ba, towards which from distant homes has been directed the prayer of the bygone years; the ascent of the Mount of Purity (\u1e62af\u0101), and prayer and confession of faith upon it; the race seven times repeated from its summit to that of the Mount of Marwa; the common worship in the Great Mosque, and the sermon preached to the assemblage of common believers; the various pilgrimages and prayers of the eighth and ninth days; and on the tenth the extraordinary pelting of devils, which is symbolized by the patriarchal rite of the stoning of the pillars of Mina. Later in the same day occurs the final act of the \u1e25aj, an animal sacrifice. Whether the ladies could pay a substitute to perform this is not said.\n\nDuring these ten busy days the seamless wrapper is worn; after the sacrifice it is laid aside, and attention may be paid to the neglected toilette. The pilgrim stays three days longer in Makka\u2014days of the \u2018drying of the blood of sacrifice,\u2019 \u2018three well-earned days of rest after the peripatetic performance of the last four.\u2019 Still, all is not finished; there should be more circuits of the ka\u2018ba, another stoning at Mina, and a draught drunk from the sacred well. Our princess would certainly do everything\nwhich was due, and probably would go to Medina, and she would also make visitation to the tombs of many pious persons buried in the desirable soil of Arabia.\n\nIn 1579 Khw\u0101ja Yahy\u0101 was m\u012br haj, a friend of Bad\u0101yun\u012b, and the charitable man to whom \u1e24usain the Patcher (tukriya) was indebted for decent burial. He was commissioned to escort the ladies home, and also to bring back curiosities and Arab servants,\\(^1\\) who may perhaps have been wanted for the Arab sara\u012b, established near the mausoleum of Hum\u0101y\u016bn, outside Dihl\u012b.\n\nThe return journey was both adventurous and perilous. They were shipwrecked off Aden, and had to stay, some say seven, others twelve, months in that desolate spot, far less habitable then than now, with condensed water, a tide from the Suez Canal, occasional rain, and the British r\u0101j. The governor did not behave well, and quitted the path of good manners, misconduct for which he was punished by his master, Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Mur\u0101d of Turkey. One pleasant incident broke the gloom of the long delay. On a day of April, 1580, the rock-bound travellers saw a ship coming up from the south with the wind, and, wishing to know whose it was, sent a boat out to make inquiry. By a pleasant chance B\u0101yaz\u012bd\\(^2\\) b\u012byat with his wife and children were on board, and he shortened sail, though the wind was favourable, and gave and took news. B\u0101yaz\u012bd says that the persons who sent out the boat to him were Gul-badan Begam, Gul-iz\u0101r Begam, and Khw\u0101ja Yahy\u0101. Perhaps\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The passage in the Akbar-n\u0101ma about these servants is in its author's later and difficult style. This led to mistake in my article of the Calcutta Review, April, 1898. I referred a difficulty the khw\u0101ja experienced to the ladies, whereas it was the servants who were unwilling to leave their Arabian domicile. Several other errors of that article are corrected in this book.\n\n\\(^2\\) His wife and a child died in Arabia; he wished to end his days on the sacred soil, and so sent home his other children. His wish also was to be laid beside his wife, and he tried her grave for several hours to see that it was neither too narrow nor too short. Happily for his readers, he did not stay in Arabia. His children were captured by the Portuguese, and he had to go back to their rescue. He sailed in 1582, but had long to wait in Mocha harbour for a wind, and this, with other delays, kept him eight months on board.\nhe was instrumental in getting them ships for return to India.\n\nI do not know when the ladies succeeded in leaving Aden, nor when they landed in S\u016brat. Here they again waited long, and this delay is attributed partly to the rains and partly to the royal absence in K\u0101bul. It was March, 1582, when they reached Fathp\u016br-sikri.\n\nOn the northward journey they visited the shrines of the Chisht\u012b saints in Ajmir, and there met Prince S\u0101lim. Day after day there came an am\u012br with greetings from the Emperor, until he met the caravan at Kh\u0101nwa. The night of reunion was kept awake by \u2018questions and entrancing stories; gifts were shown, and happiness brimmed over.\u2019 One item of home news would cloud the meeting: Bega Begam had died just too soon to welcome her old friends.\n\nArrived in Fathp\u016br-sikri, Gul-badan Begam would find much to ruffle her orthodoxy; for Father Rodolf Acquaviva was installed there and was giving Prince Mur\u0101d lessons in the Christian faith. She would hear of the reverence shown by her nephew for the sacred things of an alien faith, and of his liking for the society of the pious and learned guest. \u1e24am\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b is named by the Father as protesting, with other ladies of the haram, against the royal countenance of Christianity, and assuredly Gul-badan would swell the chorus of complaint, in which, too, Hind\u016b wives would join the Moslim lamentation.\u00b9 When the Father was leaving Fathp\u016br-sikri, he accepted only so much money as would pay his expenses back to Goa, but he asked a favour from \u1e24am\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b Begam. She had amongst her household slaves a Russian of Moscow and his Polish wife, with their two children. These four the Father begged to take with him to Goa. \u2018The begam, who was no friend to the Firingis, was most unwilling to give up the slaves; but\n\n\u00b9 The whole account of Father Acquaviva\u2019s stay at the court is extremely interesting, and much of it may be read in Father Goldie\u2019s \u2018First Christian Mission to the Great Mughal\u2019 (Dublin: Gill and Co., 1897).\nthe Emperor would refuse nothing to the Father,' and the family was carried off to freedom.\n\nThe next thing known of our princess is that she wrote her Humayun-nama. The book is its sole witness, for no one speaks of it. It is not literature, but a simple setting down of what she knew or had heard, for the help of the Akbar-nama. This was not her only composition, for she followed the fashion of her day and wrote verses. Mir Mahdi Shirazi has preserved in his Tazkiratu-l-khwat\u00een two lines of hers, in which her thought seems to be, 'No love, no fruit of life.'\n\n\"Har par\u00ee ki au b\u00e2 'ashaq khud y\u00e2r n\u00eest,\nT\u00fb yaq\u00een m\u00eed\u00e2n ki hech az 'umr bar-khur-d\u00e2r n\u00eest.\"\n\nNine copies were made of Bayazid's Humayun-nama, which was written in obedience to the royal command obeyed by Gul-badan Begam and also by Jauhar the Ewer-bearer. Of these two went to the Emperor's library; three to the princes S\u00e2lim, Mur\u00e2d, and Danyal; one to our begam; two to Ab\u00fb'l-fazl; and one perhaps was kept by the author. This allotment brings out the little point that Gul-badan collected books. Badayuni has a curious passage about himself which also discloses something 'bookish' of Salima: 'On account of the book Khirad-afza, which had disappeared from the library, and concerning Salima Sultan Begam's study of which the Emperor reminded me, an order was issued that my allowance should be stopped, and that they should demand the book of me.' He adds that Ab\u00fb'l-fazl did not lay his refutation before the Emperor, and he does not clear up the awkward doubt as to what he had done with Salima's desired book.\n\nThe remaining records of Gul-badan Begam's life are few and scanty. When she was seventy, her name is mentioned with that of Muhammad-y\u00e2r, a son of her daughter, who left the court in disgrace; again, she and Salima join in intercession to Akbar for Prince S\u00e2lim; again, with Hamida, she receives royal gifts of money and jewels. Her charities were large, and it is said of her that she added day unto day\nin the endeavour to please God, and this by succouring the poor and needy. When she was eighty years old, and in February, 1603, her departure was heralded by a few days of fever. \u1e24am\u012bda was with her to the end, and it may be that Ruqaiya, Hind\u0101l\u2019s daughter, would also watch her last hours. As she lay with closed eyes, \u1e24am\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b spoke to her by the long-used name of affection, \u2018Jiu!\u2019 (elder sister). There was no response. Then, \u2018Gul-badan!\u2019 The dying woman unclosed her eyes, quoted the verse, \u2018I die,\u2014may you live!\u2019 and passed away.\n\nAkbar helped to carry her bier some distance, and for her soul\u2019s repose made lavish gifts and did good works. He will have joined in the silent prayer for her soul before committal of her body to the earth, and if no son were there, he, as a near kinsman, may have answered the Im\u0101m\u2019s injunction to resignation: \u2018It is the will of God.\u2019\n\nSo ends the long life of a good and clever woman, affectionate and dutiful in her home life, and brought so near us by her sincerity of speech and by her truth of feeling that she becomes a friend even across the bars of time and creed and death.\n\n---\n\n**PART II.**\n\n*GUL-BADAN BEGAM'S BOOK, THE 'HUM\u0100Y\u016aN-N\u0100MA.'*\n\nIt is not generally known to English students of the (so-called) Mughal period of Indian history that Gul-badan Begam wrote a book. It was not known to Mr. Erskine, or he would have given fuller and more accurate accounts of the families of B\u0101bar and Hum\u0101y\u016bn. It escaped even Professor Blochmann\u2019s wider opportunities of acquaintance with Persian MSS. Until the begam\u2019s *Hum\u0101y\u016bn-n\u0101ma* was catalogued by Dr. Rieu, it was a literary *parda-nish\u012bn*, and since that time has been little better. Ab\u016b-l-fa\u017cl, for\nwhose information it was written, does not mention it, but the Akbar-n\u0101ma is not without indication of its use.\\(^1\\)\n\nB\u0101yazid\u2019s T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-humay\u016bn was reproduced several times on its completion. Gul-badan Begam\u2019s Humay\u016bn-n\u0101ma was written under the same royal order and for the same end. It would have been natural to reproduce it also, but no second example of it can be discovered by us in any of the accessible book-catalogues of Europe or India, and prolonged search, made by advertisement, private inquiry, and in person by my husband in India, has failed to disclose knowledge of its existence which may not conjecturally be traced to my own work upon it. Once hope arose that a second MS. was to reward the search, because a correspondent intimated that he possessed for sale a MS. which was inscribed as being the begam\u2019s. On examination this was found to be so, but the MS. was a copy of the Kan\u0101n-i-humay\u016bn of Khw\u0101nd-am\u012br. It is now in the British Museum.\n\nHope was again aroused by a mention of Gul-badan\u2019s book in a recent work, the Darb\u0101r-i-akbar\u012b of Shamsu-l-ulama\u2019f Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usain az\u0101d. Mr. Beveridge paid two visits to the author in Bombay, but could learn nothing from him. He appeared mentally alienated, denied all knowledge of the work, and that he had ever written of it. His reference may conjecturally be traced to my article in the Calcutta Review upon Gul-badan Begam\u2019s writings, and does not, unfortunately, appear to indicate access to a second MS.\n\nThe MS. from which I have translated belongs to the Hamilton Collection in the British Museum, and was bought in 1868 from the widow of Colonel George William Hamilton. It is classed by Dr. Rieu amongst the most remarkable of the 352 MSS. which were selected for purchase out of the 1,000 gathered in by Colonel Hamilton from Lucknow and Dihl\u012b. It does not bear the vermilion\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) A passage about B\u0101bar (Bib. Ind., edit. I. 87) closely resembles the begam\u2019s on the same topic; and a divergence, noted by Mr. Erskine (Mems., 218 n.) as made from B\u0101bar\u2019s narrative by Ab\u016b\u2019l-fa\u017cl, is made also by the begam.\nstamp of the King of Oude, so the surmise is allowed that it came from Dihli. It has been rebound (not recently, I believe), plainly, in red leather; and it is unadorned by frontispiece, margin, or rubric. Whether there has ever been a colophon cannot be said; the latter pages of the work are lost. The folio which now stands last is out of place, an error apparently made in the rebinding. Catchwords are frequently absent, and there are none on the last folio. There are blank fly-leaves, prefixed and suffixed, of paper unlike that of the MS.\n\nThe absence of a second MS., and, still more, the absence of mention of the work, seem to indicate that few copies ever existed.\n\nDr. Rieu's tentative estimate of the date of the British Museum MS. (seventeenth century) does not, I am counselled, preclude the possibility of transcription so late in the sixteenth century as 1587 (995 H.) onwards. It may be the first and even sole example.\n\nGul-badan Begam, as is natural, uses many T\u00fcrk\u00ee words, and at least one T\u00fcrk\u00ee phrase. Her scribe (who may be herself) does not always write these with accuracy; some run naturally from the pen as well-known words do; some are laboured in the writing, as though care had to be taken in the copying or original orthography.\n\nT\u00fcrk\u00ee was Gul-badan's native language; it was also her husband's; it would be the home speech of her married life. Persian was an accomplishment. These considerations awaken speculation: Did she compose in Persian? or in T\u00fcrk\u00ee? That she read T\u00fcrk\u00ee is clear from her upbringing and her references to her father's book. She has one almost verbal reproduction of a passage from it retained in T\u00fcrk\u00ee.\n\nThe disadvantage of working from a single MS. is felt at every point, and nowhere more than when the MS. itself is under consideration.\nTRANSLATION\n\nOF THE\n\nHUMAYUN-NAMA OF GUL-BADAN BEGAM.\nNOTE ON THE PERSIAN TITLES.\n\nOf these there are two:\n\n1. 'Hum\u0101y\u016bn-n\u0101ma. Written by Gul-badan Begam, daughter of B\u0101bar P\u0101dsh\u0101h.' This is on the first fly-leaf, which is of paper differing in colour and texture from that of the body of the MS., and identical with that of four blank sheets which are bound up at the end of the MS., perhaps to allow of writing in the missing portion of the work.\n\n2. 'Accounts of Hum\u0101y\u016bn P\u0101dsh\u0101h. Put together by Gul-badan Begam, a daughter of B\u0101bar P\u0101dsh\u0101h and a paternal aunt of Akbar P\u0101dsh\u0101h.' This stands on the first folio of the MS., which by the original paging is folio 10, and by the British Museum marking folio 2 (a).\nIn the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate!\n\nThere had been an order\\(^1\\) issued, \u2018Write down whatever you know of the doings of Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u012b and Jannat-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b.\u2019\\(^2\\)\n\nAt the time when his Majesty Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u012b passed from this perishable world to the everlasting home, I, this lowly one, was eight\\(^3\\) years old, so it may well be that I do not remember much. However, in obedience to the royal command, I set down whatever there is that I have heard and remember.\n\nFirst of all, by way of invoking a blessing (on my work), and in pious commemoration, a chapter (\\(juz\u016b\\)) is written about my royal father\u2019s deeds, although these are told in his memoirs.\\(^4\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Probably that mentioned by Ab\u016b\u2019l-fazl, as issued for the gathering-in of material for the Akbar-n\u0101ma. (H. Beveridge, I. 29.) If so, the begam\u2019s book dates from about 1587 (995H.). There are indications of its use by Ab\u016b\u2019l-fazl.\n\n\\(^2\\) B\u0101bar\u2019s and Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s posthumous names, \u2018Dwelling\u2019 and \u2018Nesting in Paradise.\u2019 Several women, and notably Akbar\u2019s mother, have been named after death Maryam-mak\u0101n\u012b, \u2018Dwelling with Mary.\u2019 B\u0101bar\u2019s half-sister, Shahr-b\u0101n\u016b, is styled by A.F. Bilq\u012bs-mak\u0101n\u012b,\u2014Bilq\u012bs being the Queen of Sheba. Many other examples might be quoted of the custom which, amongst some savage tribes, takes the extreme form of total suppression at death of the name borne in life, and towards which affection and reverence incline the most civilized peoples.\n\n\\(^3\\) Lunar years.

He became king in his twelfth year, and the khutba was read in his name on June 10th, 1494, in Andij\u0101n, the capital of Fargh\u0101na. (3a)\n\nFor eleven full years his wars and struggles against the Chaghat\u0101i and Tim\u016brid and Uzbeg princes in M\u0101war\u0101-un-nahr (Transoxiana) were such that the tongue of the pen is too feeble and weak to recount them.\n\nThe toils and perils which in the ruling of kingdoms befell our prince, have been measured out to few, and of few have been recorded the manliness, courage and endurance which he showed in battle-fields and dangers. Twice he took Samarqand by force of the sword. The first time my royal father was twelve years old, the second nineteen, the third time he was nearly twenty-two. For six months he was besieged (in Samarqand), and neither Sult\u0101n \u1e24usain M\u012brz\u0101 B\u0101yqr\u0101, his paternal uncle, who\n\nfilled in.

Twice he captured it, and the third time entered without a blow struck and amidst a popular welcome. The dates are respectively 1497, 1500, and 1511, and his age fifteen, seventeen, and twenty-nine.\n\n7 By Shaib\u0101n\u012b, after the second occupation.\n\n8 \u2018amn\u016b. \u1e24usain was of the fourth, and B\u0101bar of the fifth degree of descent from their common ancestor, Tim\u016br.

As \u1e24usain was of an elder generation, B\u0101bar calls him \u2018uncle.\u2019 If \u2018amm\u016b were ever used to denote an uncle by marriage, it would have triple application here, since \u1e24usain married in succession three paternal aunts of B\u0101bar\u2014Shahr-\nAM\u012aR T\u012aM\u016aR (\u1e62\u0100\u1e24\u012aB-Q\u012aR\u0100N).\n\n[To face p. 84.]\n(ruled) in Khur\u0101s\u0101n, nor Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd Kh\u0101n, his maternal uncle,\\(^1\\) who ruled in K\u0101shghar, sent him help.

Now he was pleased to command that Khusrau Sh\u0101h should take whatever his heart desired of his (own) jewels and golden vessels, and so he got leave to go to Khur\u0101s\u0101n in kindness and safety, and took with him five or six strings of camels and five or six of baggage mules.\\(^1\\) (4a)\n\nHis Majesty now set out for K\u0101bul, which was occupied by Mu\u1e25ammad Muq\u012bm, a son of Zu\u2019l-n\u016bn Argh\u016bn, and grandfather of N\u0101hid Begam.\\(^2\\) He had captured it after Ulugh Beg M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s\\(^3\\) death from M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Abdu-r-razz\u0101q, son of his Majesty\u2019s paternal uncle (Ulugh Beg).\n\nHis Majesty reached K\u0101bul in safety. Mu\u1e25ammad Muq\u012bm kept command for a few days, and then by pact and agreement made over charge to the royal servants, and went off with goods and chattels to his father in Qandah\u0101r. This was in the last ten days of Rab\u012b II., 910H.\\(^4\\) Being now master of K\u0101bul, his Majesty went to Bangash, took it at a blow, and returned to K\u0101bul.\n\nHer Highness, the kh\u0101nam,\\(^5\\) his Majesty\u2019s mother, had fever for six days, and then departed from this fleeting world to the eternal home.

His Majesty paid 1,000 coined misqal to his kinsmen, the owners of the garden, and laid her there.\n\nAt this time urgent letters arrived from Sult\u0101n \u1e24usain M\u012brz\u0101, saying: (4b) \u2018I am planning a war against the Uzbegs.

He had gathered a force, and safety was the condition of Khusrau\u2019s surrender (1504). Mr. Erskine writes (B. & H., I. 208.) : \u2018B\u0101bar, whose abhorrence of Khusrau was as deep as it was just, ordered his treasurer to send back the treasure, horses, and whatever had been presented to him, just as they were; although, says our author (M\u012brz\u0101 \u1e24aidar), the King had only one horse suitable for a person of his rank, and that was used by his mother.\u2019\n\n\\(^2\\) Through his daughter Mah Ch\u016bchak.\n\n\\(^3\\) A son of Ab\u016b-sa\u02bf\u012bd, known as K\u0101bul\u012b.

His Majesty\u2019s am\u012brs represented that, this being so, it was advisable to return to K\u0101bul, but he replied: \u2018As we have come so far, we will carry our condolences to the princes.\u2019 In the end he went on towards Khur\u0101s\u0101n.\n\nWhen the princes heard of the royal visit, they one and all set out to give him honourable meeting, except B\u0101di\u2018u-z-zam\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101, who did not go because Barand\u016bq Beg and Z\u016b\u2019l-n\u016bn Beg\u2014am\u012brs of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n \u1e24usain M\u012brz\u0101\u2014said, in effect, that as his Majesty was fifteen years younger than B\u0101di\u2018u-z-zam\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101, it was right that he should be the first to bow, and that they should then embrace one another. Q\u0101sim Beg rejoined: \u2018Younger he is by years, but by the t\u016bra, he has precedence because he has more than once taken Samarqand by force of the sword.\u2019 (5a) At length they agreed that his Majesty should bow on coming in, and that B\u0101di\u2018u-z-zam\u0101n should then advance to show him honour, and they should embrace. The m\u012brz\u0101 was not attending when his Majesty came in at the door; Q\u0101sim Beg clutched my royal father\u2019s girdle and pulled it, and said to Barand\u016bq Beg and Z\u016b\u2019l-n\u016bn Beg: \u2018The agreement was that the m\u012brz\u0101 should come forward and that then they should embrace one another.\u2019 The prince then advanced in great agitation and they embraced.\n\nAs long as his Majesty was in Khur\u0101s\u0101n, each one of the princes showed him hospitality, and feasts were arranged, and excursions to all the gardens and places of\n\n---\n\n1 B\u0101bar set out in June, 1506 (Mu\u1e25arram, 912H.). \u1e24usain had died in May (Z\u016b\u2019l-hijja, 911H.), on his way northwards from Her\u0101t, and at B\u0101b\u0101 Il\u0101h\u012b. Word reached B\u0101bar when he had already made a great journey and had crossed the Saighan and Dand\u0101n-shikan passes to Kahmard. After receiving the news he marched some 800 miles to the m\u012brz\u0101s\u2019 camp on the Murgh-\u0101b.\n\n2 B\u0101di\u2018u-z-zam\u0101n and Mu\u1e25ammad Mu\u1e93affar \u1e24usain, sons of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n \u1e24usain M\u012brz\u0101.

They set forth to him the inconvenience of winter, and said: 'Wait till it is over, and we will fight the Uzbegs.' But they could not in any way settle about the war. Eighty years\\(^1\\) long had Sult\u0101n \u1e24usain Mirz\u0101 kept Khur\u0101s\u0101n safe and sound, but the m\u012brz\u0101s could not fill their father's place for six months. When his Majesty saw that they were careless\\(^2\\) about his expenses and revenue, he went to K\u0101bul on the pretext of seeing the places he had assigned to himself.\\(^5b\\) Much snow had fallen that year. They took the wrong road. His Majesty and Q\u0101sim Beg chose one\\(^3\\) because of its shortness, but the am\u012brs had given other advice, and when this was not taken, they all left him without a thought for him. He and Q\u0101sim Beg and his sons made a road in two or three days by removing the snow, and the people of the army followed. So they reached Gh\u016brband. Some Haz\u0101ra rebels having met his Majesty here, there was fighting; and cattle and sheep and goods without number belonging to the Haz\u0101ra fell into the hands of his people. Then they started for K\u0101bul with their enormous booty.\n\nAt the skirts of Min\u0101r Hill they heard that M\u012brz\u0101 Kh\u0101n\\(^4\\) and M\u012brz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usain G\u016brk\u0101n\\(^5\\) had rebelled and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) A well-rounded number. Sult\u0101n Husain was born 842H. (1438), and died 911H. (1506). B\u0101bar calls the joint-kingship of his sons a strange arrangement and one never heard of, and quotes Sa'di's well-known couplet as applicable\u2014'Ten darvishes can sleep on one rug, but one climate cannot hold two kings.'\n\n\\(^2\\) While on the Murgh-\u0101b, B\u0101bar agreed to winter in Khur\u0101s\u0101n, and he went with the joint-kings to Her\u0101t in order to see the 'sights' of that renowned city. He certainly worked hard, for he names some fifty-two which he saw in twenty days. The invitation to winter was repeated, but neither quarters nor suitable conveniences (? revenues) were allotted. B\u0101bar delicately says he could not explain his real motive for not remaining, and left under pressure of necessity on December 24th, 1506, after snow had fallen along a route which was a month's ordinary journey.\n\nIt was during this absence from K\u0101bul that he married M\u0101ham, Hum\u0101y\u016bn's mother.\n\n\\(^3\\) Through the Aim\u0101q and Haz\u0101ra country, and south of his route to Her\u0101t.\n\n\\(^4\\) Sult\u0101n Wais, a son of B\u0101bar's paternal uncle, Mahm\u016bd, and his maternal aunt (i.e., his mother's half-sister), Sult\u0101n Nig\u0101r Kh\u0101nam.\n\n\\(^5\\) Father of Haidar M\u012brz\u0101 Dughl\u0101t, author of the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-rash\u012bd\u012b.

His Majesty sent a comforting and cheering letter (to his friends in the fort), and said: \u2018Be of good heart! I too am here. (6a) I will light a fire on the Hill of the Moon-faced Lady; do you light one on the Treasury, so that I may be sure you know of our coming. In the morning we will fall on the enemy, you from that side and we from this.\u2019 But he had fought and won before the people of the fort came out.\n\nM\u012brz\u0101 Kh\u0101n hid himself in his mother\u2019s house; she was his Majesty\u2019s maternal aunt. M\u012brz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usain was in his wife\u2019s house. She was his Majesty\u2019s younger maternal aunt. He flung himself down on a carpet, and in fear of his life cried to a servant, \u2018Fasten it up!\u2019 His Majesty\u2019s people heard of this. They took him out of the carpet and brought him to the presence. In the end, his Majesty forgave the m\u012brz\u0101s their offences, for the sake of his aunts. He used to go, in his old fashion, in and out of his aunts\u2019 houses,\u00b9 and showed them more and more affection, so that no mist of trouble might dim their hearts. He assigned them places and holdings in the plain-country. (6b)\n\nGod the most High, having freed K\u0101bul from the power of M\u012brz\u0101 Kh\u0101n, committed it to my royal father\u2019s care. He was then twenty-three years old\u00b2 and had no child and greatly desired one. In his seventeenth year a girl\u00b3 had been born to him by \u2018\u0100yisha Sult\u0101n Begam, a daughter of Sult\u0101n A\u1e25mad M\u012brz\u0101, but she had died in a month. The most high God blessed the taking of K\u0101bul, for after it eighteen children were born. (1.) Of my Lady (Ak\u0101m\u2074) who was M\u0101ham Begam there were born his Majesty the Emperor\n\n\u00b9 Text, kh\u0101na kh\u0101l\u012b kh\u0101lah\u0101\u02bei. This I do not understand, as there were certainly no mothers\u2019 brothers present in K\u0101bul now.\n\u00b2 He was twenty-three when he took K\u0101bul from Mu\u1e25ammad Muq\u012bm Argh\u016bn in 1504. M\u012brz\u0101 Kh\u0101n\u2019s rebellion took place two years later.\n\u00b3 Fakhru-n-nis\u0101\u02be, the Glory of Women. \u2018She was my first child, and I was just nineteen. In a month, or forty days, she went to the mercy of God.\u2019 (Mems, 90.)\n\u2074 Written sometimes Ak\u0101m, and sometimes Akam. The T\u00fcrk\u012b Ak\u0101 is used as a title of respect from a junior to a senior. It has also the sense \u2018elder brother,\u2019 which makes application to a woman doubtful.\nHum\u0101y\u016bn, and B\u0101rb\u016bl M\u012brz\u0101, and Mihr-j\u0101n (jah\u0101n) Begam, and Ish\u0101n-daulat Begam, and F\u0101r\u016bq M\u012brz\u0101.\\(^1\\)\n\n(2.) Ma\u2019s\u016bma Sult\u0101n Begam, daughter of Sult\u0101n A\u1e25mad M\u012brz\u0101, died in childbirth. The mother\u2019s name they gave to the daughter.\n\n(3.) Of Gul-rukh Begam were born K\u0101mr\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101, and \u2018Askar\u012b M\u012brz\u0101, and Sh\u0101h-rukh M\u012brz\u0101, and Sult\u0101n A\u1e25mad M\u012brz\u0101, and Gul-\u2018iz\u0101r Begam.\n\n(4.) Of Dil-d\u0101r Begam were born Gul-rang Begam, and Gul-chihra Begam, and Hind\u0101l M\u012brz\u0101, and Gul-badan Begam, and Alwar M\u012brz\u0101.\\(^2\\)\n\nIn short, in taking K\u0101bul he got a good omen. All his children were born there except two begams who were born in Khost, viz., Mihr-j\u0101n Begam, a daughter of M\u0101ham Begam, and Gul-rang, a daughter of Dil-d\u0101r Begam.\\(^7a\\)\n\nThe blessed birth of the Emperor Hum\u0101y\u016bn, the first-born son of his Majesty Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u016b, occurred in the night of Tuesday, Z\u016b\u2019l-qa\u2019d\u0101 4th, 913H. (March 6th, 1508), in the citadel of K\u0101bul, and when the sun was in the sign Pisces.\n\nThat same year his Majesty was pleased to order the am\u012brs and the rest of the world to style him emperor (b\u0101dsh\u0101h). For before the birth of the Emperor Hum\u0101y\u016bn he had been named and styled M\u012brz\u0101 B\u0101bar. All kings\u2019 sons were called m\u012brz\u0101s. In the year of his Majesty Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s birth he styled himself b\u0101dsh\u0101h.\n\nThey found\\(^3\\) the date of the birth in Sultan Humayun Kh\u0101n, and also in Shah-(i)-f\u012broz-qadr.\\(^4\\)\n\nAfter children had been born to him, news came that Sh\u0101h Ism\u0101\u2019il had killed Sh\u0101h\u012b Beg Kh\u0101n.\\(^5\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Born 1525; died 1527. His father never saw him.\n\n\\(^2\\) Gul-badan or her copyist does not balance accounts. She says eighteen, and names sixteen children. This may be a clerical error only.\n\n\\(^3\\) i.e., by abjad.

On the removal of this formidable foe, B\u0101bar again tried to regain his ancestral lands, but was still outmatched by the Uzbegs. Defeat by them led him to take a road of less resistance through Bajaur to Hind\u016bst\u0101n.\n\n(Cf. Vamb\u00e9ry\u2019s \u2018Cagataische Sprach-studien.\u2019) B\u0101bar uses the word (Mems. 208.), and Mr. Erskine suggests to read \u2018My Lady.\u2019\nHis Majesty at this time entrusted K\u0101bul to N\u0101\u1e63ir\u00b9 Mirz\u0101, and set out\u00b2 for Samarqand, taking with him his people and wives and children, who were Hum\u0101y\u016bn Mirz\u0101, and Mihr-jah\u0101n Begam, and B\u0101rb\u016bl Mirz\u0101, and Ma\u02be\u0161\u016bma Begam, and K\u0101mr\u0101n Mirz\u0101. (7b)\n\nWith help from Sh\u0101h Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl, he took Samarqand (October, 1511), and for eight (lunar) months the whole of M\u0101war\u0101\u02beu-n-nahr (Transoxiana) was in his power. Owing to want of co-operation in his brothers and to the opposition of the Mughals,\u00b3 he was defeated at K\u016bl Malik by \u02bfUbadu-l-l\u0101h Kh\u0101n. As he could not remain in those parts, he set out for Badakhsh\u0101n and K\u0101bul, and put out of his head further thought of M\u0101war\u0101\u02beu-n-nahr.\n\nHe had become master of K\u0101bul in 910H. (1504). He had always desired to go into Hind\u016bst\u0101n, and had not carried out his wish because of the feeble counsels of his amirs and the non-agreement of his brothers. When at length these were gone,\u2074 and there remained no am\u012br such as could argue against it, he accomplished his desire.\n\nBajaur\u2075 he took in two or three hours and ordered a general massacre.\n\nOn the same day the father of Afgh\u0101n\u012b \u0101gh\u0101cha,\u2076 Malik Man\u1e63\u016br Y\u016bsufzai, came in and paid his respects. (sa) His Majesty took his daughter in marriage and then gave him leave to depart. He bestowed on him a horse and a suit of honour befitting a ruler, and said to him: \u2018Go and\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 B\u0101bar\u2019s half-brother, son of Um\u012bd, an Andij\u0101n\u012b.\n\u00b2 January, 1511 (Shaww\u0101l, 916H.).\n\u00b3 For a more interesting cause of defeat, cf. B. & H., I. 321, et seq.\n\u2074 i.e., dead. Jah\u0101ng\u012br died in 1507 and N\u0101\u1e63ir in 1515, both from drinking. This passage resembles B\u0101bar\u2019s own words. (Mems. 309.)\n\u2075 Gul-badan is confusingly brief. Bajaur was attacked 925H. (1519) on the way to India, and its people put to the sword because they were \u2018rebels to followers of Isl\u0101m\u2019 and addicted to infidel customs. (Mems. 246 et seq..)\n\u2076 The Afgh\u0101n Lady. It is thus that Gul-badan always speaks of Bibi (Lady) Mub\u0101rika, the Y\u016bsufzai wife of B\u0101bar. Pavet de Courteille defines \u0101gh\u0101cha thus: \u2018Se dit des femmes par opposition \u00e0 begam et kh\u0101nam; dame.\u2019 I do not in Gul-badan\u2019s work trace any disrespect attaching to \u2018\u0101gh\u0101cha,\u2019 such as is indicated by \u2018concubine,\u2019 as which it is sometimes translated.\nbring men and labourers, etc., to your native land and cultivate it.'\n\nQ\u0101sim Beg,\\(^1\\) who was in K\u0101bul, sent a letter saying: 'Another prince has been born. I have ventured to write as an omen of the conquest of Hind and of taking its throne. As for the rest, the Emperor is master, whatever is his pleasure'\\(^2\\) (let it be done). In an auspicious hour his Majesty named him M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l.\n\nHaving subdued Bajaur, his Majesty went towards the Bh\u012bra country, and on his arrival made peace without plundering. He took four laks of sh\u0101hrukh\u012bs\\(^3\\) and gave to his army, dividing them according to the number of his followers. He then set out for K\u0101bul.\\(^4\\)\n\nJust now came a letter from Badakhsh\u0101n saying: 'M\u012brz\u0101 Kh\u0101n is dead;\\(^5\\) M\u012brz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n is young; the Uzbegs are near; take thought for this kingdom lest (which God forbid) Badakhsh\u0101n should be lost.' (8b) Until there should be thought taken, M\u012brz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n's mother\\(^6\\) had brought him (to the Emperor). Agreeably to this petition and their wish, the Emperor assigned to M\u012brz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n the lands and inheritance which had been his father's, and he gave Badakhsh\u0101n to M\u012brz\u0101 Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\n\nThe m\u012brz\u0101 set out for his province. His Majesty and my Lady (Ak\u0101m) followed and also went to Badakhsh\u0101n, and there spent several days together. The m\u012brz\u0101 remained\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Q\u0101sim Beg Q\u016bch\u012bn, an ancient Beg of Andij\u0101n, and one of B\u0101bar's best followers.\n\n\\(^2\\) Q.y., as to the child's name. His true name was Mu\u1e25. N\u0101\u1e63ir, but he is only known as Hind\u0101l. He was Gul-badan's full brother, and was given, before birth, to M\u0101ham Begam, who had lost all her children younger than Hum\u0101y\u016bn. Cf. 24a n.\n\n\\(^3\\) Estimated by Mr. Erskine at about \u00a320,000 sterling.\n\n\\(^4\\) End of February, 1519. In his winning fashion B\u0101bar relates that he forbade the news of his return to be taken to K\u0101bul, and that there was therefore no time to put his boys, Hum\u0101y\u016bn and K\u0101mr\u0101n, on horseback, and that they were carried out in the arms of the nearest servants to offer their duty on his return, to a place between the fort gates and the citadel.\n\n\\(^5\\) Cir. 926H. (1520). Cf. Mem. 286 n., and T\u0101r. Rash., Ney Elias and Ross, 373 n.\n\n\\(^6\\) Sult\u0101n Nigar Kh\u0101nam.\nand my royal father and my Lady came back to K\u0101bul\\(^1\\) (926H.\u20141520).\n\nAfter a time his Majesty set out for Qil\u0101t and Qandah\u0101r.\\(^2\\) He was victorious at once in Qil\u0101t, and went on to Qandah\u0101r and kept its garrison shut up for a year and a half. Then, by the Divine favour and after great fighting and skirmishing, he captured it. Much gold fell into his hands, and he gave moneys and camels to his soldiers and the people of the army. Qandah\u0101r he bestowed on M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n, and himself set off for K\u0101bul.\n\nHis advance camp having been set up,\\(^3\\) he crossed the hill of Yak Langa, and gloriously alighted in the valley of D\u012bh-i-ya'q\u016bb on Friday, \u0160afar 1st, 932H. (November 17th, 1525), when the sun was in Sagittarius. (9a) He spent the following day there, and on the next set forth, march by march, for Hind\u016bst\u0101n. In the seven or eight years since 925H. (1519)\\(^4\\) the royal army had several times renewed the attempt on Hind\u016bst\u0101n. Each time it used to conquer lands and districts, such as Bh\u012bra, Bajaur, Si\u0101lk\u016bt, D\u012bp\u0101lp\u016br, L\u0101h\u014dr, etc., up to the fifth time, when on \u0160afar 1st, 932H., his Majesty went, march by march, from his glorious encamping in D\u012bh-i-ya'q\u016bb towards Hind\u016bst\u0101n. He conquered L\u0101h\u014dr and Sirhind, and every country that lay on his path.\n\nOn Friday, Rajab 8th, 932H. (April 20th, 1526), he\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Hum\u0101y\u016bn was now thirteen years old. He was young to be sent so far as Badakhsh\u0101n. That his parents went with him is one of Gul-badan's life-giving touches. Ak\u0101m may now well have shown her boy to her father and her kinsfolk in Khost. (Memoirs of B\u0101yaz\u012bd, I.O. MS., 26a.)\n\n\\(^2\\) Held now by Sh\u0101h Beg Argh\u016bn, father of Sh\u0101h Husain, Hum\u0101y\u016bn's later enemy in Sind. Firishta gives three years as the duration of the siege, Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n four years, and M\u012brz\u0101 Haidar five years. The occurrence unfortunately coincides with one of the gaps in the Memoirs. This was B\u0101bar's culminating attempt on Qandah\u0101r; his first being in 1505,\u2014this one seems to have ended in 1522 (928H.).\n\n\\(^3\\) Gul-badan, by a sudden transition, passes over some three years, and, as it seems, using her father's Memoirs, enters on the account of his last and successful expedition to Hind\u016bst\u0101n. Yak Langa is a hill between K\u0101bul and Butkh\u0101k, and on the road to Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d.\n\n\\(^4\\) Text, 935H.; clearly a slip.\narrayed battle at P\u0101n\u012bpat against Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, son of Sult\u0101n Sikandar, son of Bahl\u016bl Lod\u012b. By God\u2019s grace he was victorious, and Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm was killed in the fight.\n\nHis victory was won purely by the Divine grace, for Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm had a lak and 80,000 horse, and as many as 1,500 head of fierce elephants; (9b) while his Majesty\u2019s army with the traders and good and all (badr (?) bad, bad) was 12,000 persons and he had, at the outside, 6,000 or 7,000 serviceable men.\n\nThe treasures of five kings fell into his hands. He gave everything away. The am\u012brs of Hind represented that in Hind\u016bst\u0101n it was thought disgraceful to expend the treasure of bygone kings, and that people rather added and added to it, while his Majesty, on the contrary, had given all away.\u00b2\n\nKhw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n Beg asked leave several times to go to K\u0101bul. He said: \u2018My constitution is not fitted for the climate of Hind\u016bst\u0101n. If leave were given, I should tarry awhile in K\u0101bul.\u2019 His Majesty was not at all, at all willing for him to go, but at last gave permission because he saw him so very urgent. He said: \u2018When you go, I shall send some of the valuable presents and curiosities of Hind which fell into our hands through the victory over\n\n\u00b9 \u2018A far-reaching, almost illimitable level tract, broken only by insignificant undulations. Here and there, where the shallow soil is moistened from some niggardly watercourse, grow sparse grasses and stunted thorn-bushes. But, for the most part, the eye falls only on the uniform yellowish-gray waste of sterile earth. Everywhere empty silence reigns, and it would almost seem as if this desert had been designed for the battlefield of nations.\u2019 (Emperor Akbar, F. v. Noer., trs. A.S.B. I. 74.)\n\nThrice in modern times a decisive battle has been fought out here: (1) by B\u0101bar against Ibr\u0101h\u012bm and the Lod\u012bs, 1526; (2) by Akbar against the Indian Afgh\u0101ns in 1556; and (3) by \u0100\u1e25mad Sh\u0101h Durr\u0101n\u012b against the Mar\u0101th\u0101s in 1761.\n\n\u00b2 B\u0101bar distributed the treasure on the 11th or 12th of May, 1526, and left himself so little that he was dubbed galandar.\n\n\u00b3 M. Gar\u00e7in de Tassy says, in his \u2018M\u00e9moire sur la Religion Musalmane\u2019 (46 n.) that khw\u0101ja, like sayyid, is a title for a descendant of Muhammad. Shaw\u2019s T\u00fcrki Dictionary states that khw\u0101ja is applied to the offspring of a sayyid by a woman of another family, also to their descendants. I find many instances where both titles are applied to the same man.\n\n\u2074 One of B\u0101bar\u2019s most admirable followers and friends, and perhaps a relation. He was one of seven brothers, sons of Maul\u0101n\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad \u0160adru-d-d\u012bn, who spent their lives in B\u0101bar\u2019s service.\nSult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, to my elder relations\\(^1\\) and sisters and each person of the \u1e25aram. You take them. I shall write a list, and you will distribute them according to it. (10a) You will order a tent with a screen to be set up in the Garden of the Audience Hall for each begam,\\(^2\\) and when a pleasant meeting-place has been arranged, the begams are to make the prostration of thanks for the complete victory which has been brought about.\n\nTo each begam is to be delivered as follows: one special dancing-girl of the dancing-girls of Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, with one gold plate full of jewels\u2014ruby and pearl, cornelian and diamond, emerald and turquoise, topaz and cat\u2019s-eye\u2014and two small mother-o\u2019-pearl trays full of ashraf\u012bs, and on two other trays sh\u0101hrukh\u012bs,\\(^3\\) and all sorts of stuffs by nines\u2014that is, four trays and one plate. Take a dancing-girl and another plate of jewels, and one each of ashraf\u012bs and sh\u0101hrukh\u012bs, and present, in accordance with my directions, to my elder relations the very plate of jewels and the self-same dancing-girl which I have given for them. I have made other gifts;\\(^4\\) convey these afterwards. (10b) Let them divide and present jewels and ashraf\u012bs and sh\u0101hrukh\u012bs and stuffs to my sisters and children and the \u1e25arams\\(^5\\) and kinsmen, and to the begams and \u0101gh\u0101s\\(^6\\) and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) wal\u012byu-n-ni\u2019mat\u0101n, lords of beneficence. Gul-badan\u2019s application of it is to \u2018benevolent ladies,\u2019 i.e., the numerous aunts. It is a title of respect for seniors.\n\n\\(^2\\) I think each begam was to encamp with her own establishment and within her own enclosure (sar\u0101parda), and not in hasty camp-fashion of community of quarters. This would exalt the assembly.\n\nThe sarap\u0101rda or enclosing canvas wall, run at optional distance round tents, was, it is stated in the Ma\u2019\u0101siru-r-ra\u1e25\u012bmi, invented by B\u0101iram Kh\u0101n-i-kh\u0101n\u0101n, and if this is true, it must at this date have been a quite modern convenience.\n\n\\(^3\\) It is waste of time to try to estimate the amount of these money gifts, made as they were in coins of uncertain value and recorded, probably on hearsay, more than fifty years after bestowal. Mr. Erskine puts the sh\u0101hrukh\u012b at from 10d. to 1s., Steingass, s.v.ashrafi, gives for its value about 16 rup\u012bs, presumably of undegenerated rank.\n\n\\(^4\\) Qy., for the elder relations.\n\n\\(^5\\) Presumably of his kinsmen and of officers whose families were with B\u0101bar\u2019s own in K\u0101bul.\n\n\\(^6\\) This word seems to describe women who were heads of household departments and not merely the guardians of \u1e25arams.\nnurses and foster-brethren and ladies, and to all who pray for me.' The gifts were made according to the list.\n\nThree happy days they remained together in the Audience Hall Garden. They were uplifted by pride, and recited the *fat\u012b\u1e25a*\u00b9 for the benediction and prosperity of his Majesty, and joyfully made the prostration of thanks.\u00b2\n\nThe Emperor sent by Khw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n a large *ashraf\u012b*,\u00b3 which weighed three imperial *\u015b\u012br*, that is, fifteen *\u015b\u012br* of Hind, for . . . 'Asas.\u2074 He said to the Khw\u0101ja: 'If 'Asas asks you, \"What has the Emperor sent for me?\" say, \"One *ashraf\u012b*,\"' as there really was only one. 'Asas was amazed, and fretted about it for three days. His Majesty had ordered that a hole should be bored in the *ashraf\u012b*, and that 'Asas should be blindfolded and the *ashraf\u012b* hung round his neck, and that then he was to be sent into the *haram*. The hole was bored and the *ashraf\u012b* hung round his neck. He was quite helpless with surprise at its weight, and delighted and very, very happy. He took it in both hands, and wondered over it and said, 'No one shall get my *ashraf\u012b*.' Each begam, too, gave (? him) ten or twelve *ashraf\u012b*, so he had seventy or eighty. (11a)\n\nAfter Khw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n Beg had started for K\u0101bul, the Emperor made gifts in Agra to his Majesty Hum\u0101y\u016bn and\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 The first chapter of the Qur\u0101n.\n\u00b2 In this prostration the forehead touches the ground.\n\u00b3 Perhaps from the Lodi treasury.

The words preceding 'Asas offer much difficulty. They may be read *ba 'amm\u016b*\u2014to the paternal uncle of 'Asas. But the story is of 'Asas, the night-guard and not of his uncle. Perhaps *'amm\u016b* is a clerical error for *'amah*, bewilderment, misleading, and this would suit the story well. Mr. Beveridge has suggested to me to read *'Umar\u012b*, i.e., an old servant of 'Umar Shaikh. This, too, would be appropriate, for the victim of the hoax is clearly an old man.\n\nThe title 'Asas is applied several times by B\u0101bar. One 'Asas was a boon companion and partook of B\u0101bar's vow before the battle of Kh\u0101nwa. (Mems. 283 and 354; Firishta, Pers. Text, Briggs I. 449.) Gul-badan names one (20b) as entrusted with the care of B\u0101bar's tomb,\u2014Mu\u1e25. 'Al\u012b 'Asas.

He sent letters in all directions, urgently saying, \u2018We shall take into full favour all who enter our service, and especially such as served our father and grandfather and ancestors. If such will come to us, they will receive fitting benefits. Whoever there may be of the families of \u0160\u0101h\u012bb-qir\u0101n and Ching\u012bz Kh\u0101n, let them turn towards our court. The most High has given us sovereignty in Hind\u016bst\u0101n; let them come that we may see prosperity together.\u2019\n\nSeven\\(^1\\) daughters of Sult\u0101n Ab\u016b-sa\u02bf\u012bd came (to Hind\u016bst\u0101n): G\u016bhar-sh\u0101d Begam, and Fakhr-jah\u0101n Begam, and Khadija Sult\u0101n Begam, and Badi\u02bfu-l-jam\u0101l Begam, and \u0100q Begam, and Sult\u0101n Bakht Begam.\n\n(Also) Zainab Sult\u0101n Kh\u0101nam, daughter of his Majesty\u2019s maternal uncle, Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd Kh\u0101n, and Mu\u1e25ibb Sult\u0101n Kh\u0101nam,\\(^2\\) daughter of Il\u0101cha Kh\u0101n (Ahmad), his Majesty\u2019s younger maternal uncle.\n\nIn short, all the begams and kh\u0101nams went, ninety-six persons in all, and all received houses and lands and gifts to their heart\u2019s desire. (11b)\n\nAll through the four years that (my father) was in \u0100gra he used to go on Fridays to see his paternal aunts. One day it was extremely hot, and her Highness my lady (Ak\u0101m) said, \u2018The wind is very hot, indeed; how would it be if you did not go this one Friday? The begams would not be vexed.\u2019 His Majesty said, \u2018M\u0101ham! it is astonishing that you should say such things! The daughters of Ab\u016b-sa\u02bf\u012bd Sult\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101, who have been deprived of father and brothers! If I do not cheer them, how will it be done?\u2019\n\nTo the architect, Khw\u0101ja Q\u0101sim, his Majesty gave the following order: \u2018We command a piece of good service from you. It is this: whatever work, even if it be on a great scale, our paternal aunts may order done in their\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Six only named.\n\\(^2\\) Wife of M\u012brz\u0101 \u1e24aidar Dughl\u0101t, the historian.\npalace, give it precedence, and carry it out with might and main.'\n\nHe commanded buildings to be put up in \u0100gra on the other side of the river,\\(^1\\) and a stone palace to be built for himself between the haram and the garden. He also had one built in the audience court, with a reservoir in the middle and four chambers in the four towers. On the river's bank he had a chaukand\u012b\\(^2\\) built. (12a)\n\nHe ordered a tank made in Dholp\u016br, ten by ten,\\(^3\\) out of a single mass of rock, and used to say, 'When it is finished, I will fill it with wine.' But as he had given up wine before the fight with R\u0101n\u0101 Sang\u0101, he filled it with lemonade.\n\nA year after Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm's death, the r\u0101n\u0101\\(^4\\) appeared from the Mand\u016b (or Hind\u016b) side with a countless host. Am\u012brs and r\u0101jas and r\u0101n\u0101s, every one of those who had come earlier and paid duty to his Majesty, now became an enemy and went and joined the r\u0101n\u0101, until K\u016bl-jal\u0101l\u012b and Sambhal and R\u0101pri\u2014every pargana,\u2014and r\u0101'\u012bs and r\u0101jas and Afgh\u0101ns became hostile. Nearly two laks of cavalry assembled.\n\nAt this time, Mu\u1e25ammad Shar\u012bf, the astrologer, said to the royal soldiers, 'It would be best for the Emperor not to fight, for the constellation Sakkiz Y\u0131ld\u0131z (Eight Stars) is opposite.' Amazing perturbation fell upon the royal army. They became exceedingly anxious and troubled,\\(^5\\) and showed signs of cowardice. (12b) When his Majesty saw his army\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) i.e., opposite the fort.\n\n\\(^2\\) 'A building on the roof which has a door on each of the four sides.' Vullers, 602. B\u0101d\u0101oni uses ghurfa, upper room, as an equivalent. Cf. Elliot's History of India, V. 347 and 503.\n\n\\(^3\\) About 20 feet by 20 feet. (Mems. 398 n.)\n\n\\(^4\\) This decisive battle was fought on March 16th, 1527, on the skirts of the hill of S\u012bkr\u012b, at Kh\u0101nwa. Akbar's pr\u00e6nomen of Fathip\u016br\u2014the City of Victory\u2014was given to S\u012bkr\u012b in 1573 to commemorate the Gujrat campaign.\n\n\\(^5\\) When the fight had been won, B\u0101bar soundly rated Mu\u1e25ammad Shar\u012bf, gave him money, and dismissed him to the place from which he had emerged, apparently only to cause trouble. He had come to India with a royal kinsman from K\u0101bul, and to K\u0101bul in 1519 from Khost (M\u0101ham's home).\nin this state, he thought over the whole position. As the enemy was close at hand, this device occurred to his blessed mind; he ordered the remnant of what remained over and above deserters and enemies, to gather together. One and all came\u2014am\u012brs and kh\u0101ns and sult\u0101ns; plebeian and noble, low and high. Then he addressed them, and said: \u2018Do you not know that there lies a journey of some months between us and the land of our birth and our familiar city? If our side is defeated, (God preserve us from that day! God forbid it!) where are we? where is our birthplace? where our city? We have to do with strangers and foreigners. It is in every way best for each man to set resolutely before himself the two alternatives: if we win, we are avengers of the cause of God; if we lose, we die martyrs. In either fate is our salvation; each is a step and upward stage in greatness.\u2019\n\nTo this they all agreed. They swore by the divorce of their wives and on the Holy Book; they recited the fati\u1e25a, and said, \u2018O King! God willing, we will not spare ourselves in sacrifice and devotion, so long as there are breath and life in our bodies.\u2019\u00b9 (13a)\n\nTwo days before the battle his Majesty renounced wine, and, indeed, he forswore all forbidden things. Following his example, 400 young men of name, who had given proof of manliness and one-mindedness and friendship, also renounced these things when he did. His Majesty broke up all forbidden utensils,\u2014vessels of gold and of silver, goblets and flasks, etc.; and he gave them to the poor and needy.\n\nHe also sent abroad firm\u0101ns with the announcement: \u2018We exempt (you) from all dues and octroi and tithe on corn, and from all illegal imposts, so that no one, trader or\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Erskine thus gives B\u0101bar\u2019s words: \u2018Every man dies. God only survives unchangeable. He who comes to life\u2019s feast must drink the parting cup of death. How much better to die with honour than to live with infamy!\u2019\n\nPerhaps, as Gul-badan says, B\u0101bar touched also the thought of home, and this would be recorded by the woman.\nother, may be hampered in his comings and goings, but all may move unmolested and free from interference.'\n\nIn the night before the battle word was brought that Q\u0101sim Husain Sult\u0101n,\u2014a grandson of Sult\u0101n Husain Mirz\u0101 through a daughter, \u2018\u0100yisha Sult\u0101n Begam,\u2014had come to within ten k\u014ds (of the royal camp) on his way from Khur\u0101s\u0101n. (13b)\n\nThis news delighted his Majesty greatly. He asked, 'How many men are with him?' When he heard 'thirty or forty,' he at once sent off 1,000 troopers, all armed and equipped, at midnight, so that they might march in again with Q\u0101sim Husain Sult\u0101n, and in this way the enemy and outsiders be let know that reinforcements had come in good time. Everyone who heard the plan thought it a good one.\n\nNext morning, which was March 16th, 1527 (Jum\u0101da II. [13th], 933H.), his Majesty arrayed battle against R\u0101n\u0101 Sang\u0101 on the skirts of the hill of S\u012bkr\u012b, where now Fathp\u016br has been built\u00b2 and peopled. By the Divine grace he was victorious and became an avenger of the cause of God.\u00b3\n\nA year later my lady (ak\u0101m), who was M\u0101ham Begam, came from K\u0101bul to Hind\u016bst\u0101n. I, this insignificant one, came with her in advance of my sisters, and paid my duty to my royal father. When my lady reached K\u016bl(-jal\u0101l\u012b\u2014i.e., 'Alighar), his Majesty had sent two litters with three horsemen. (14a) She went on post-haste from K\u016bl to \u0100gra. His Majesty had intended to go as far as K\u016bl-jal\u0101l\u012b to meet her. At evening-prayer time some one came and said to him: 'I have just passed her Highness on the road, four miles out.' My royal father did not wait for a horse to be\n\n\u00b9 B\u0101bar says that Q\u0101sim had come earlier and with 500 men. Muh. Sharif, the 'rascally fellow' and 'evil-minded wretch,' was with him.

My m\u0101m\u0101s\\(^9\\) had made me alight at the Little Garden, and having spread a small carpet, seated me on it. They instructed me to rise when Khal\u012bfa came in, and to embrace him. When he came, I rose and embraced him. Then his wife Sult\u0101nam came in\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) dar pesh kh\u0101na nanacha M\u0101ham.

She is several times mentioned, and it appears from a MS. belonging to Colonel Hanna which Mr. Beveridge has examined, that she was mother-in-law of the celebrated M\u0101ham anaga who was Nad\u012bm\u2019s wife.\ntoo. (14b) I, not knowing, wished to get up, but Khalifa raised objections, and said: \u2018She is your old serving-woman. There is no need to rise for her. Your father has exalted this old servant (? himself) by giving such an order\\(^1\\) about him. So be it! what power have slaves?\u2019\n\nFrom Khalifa I accepted 6,000 sh\u0101hrukh\u012bs and five horses, and Sult\u0101nam gave me 3,000 and three horses. Then she said: \u2018A hasty meal (m\u0101 \u1e25azar\u016b) is ready. If you will eat you will honour your servants.\u2019 I consented. There was a raised platform in a pleasant spot, and a pavilion of red cloth with lining of Gujr\u0101t\u012b brocade, and six canopies of cloth and brocade, each of a (differing) colour, and a square enclosure\\(^2\\) of cloth with painted poles.\n\nI sat in Khalifa\u2019s quarters. The meal drew out to almost fifty roast sheep,\\(^3\\) and bread and sherbet and much fruit. Having at length eaten my breakfast, I got into my litter and went and paid my duty to my royal father. (15a)\n\nI fell at his feet; he asked me many questions, and took me for a time in his arms, and then this insignificant person felt such happiness that greater could not be imagined.\n\nWhen we had been in \u0100gra three months, the Emperor went to Dholp\u016br. Her Highness M\u0101ham Begam and this lowly person also went. A tank had been made there, ten (gaz) by ten, out of one piece (of rock). From Dholp\u016br his Majesty went on to S\u012bk\u1e5b\u012b. He ordered a great platform made in the middle of the tank, and when it was ready, he used to go and sit on it, or to row about. This platform still exists.\n\nThey also made a chaukand\u012b in the S\u012bk\u1e5b\u012b garden, and my\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) (?) as that she should rise to greet him.\n\n\\(^2\\) Text, chah\u0101r ch\u016bqa-i-sar\u0101parda.

Possibly one should read panj \u0101h\u0101r, five foods, i.e., courses, dishes. Gul-badan is now between five and six. Her doubt as to the reception due to Sult\u0101nam rings true, and Khalifa\u2019s words suggest a little play-acting to please the small traveller; he treated her like a grown-up, and she tried to act one.\nroyal father put up in it a *t\u016br-kh\u0101na*,\u00b9 where he used to sit and write his book.\u00b2\n\nI and Afgh\u0101n\u012b \u0101gh\u0101cha were sitting in the front of the lower storey when my lady went to prayers. I said to Afgh\u0101n\u012b \u0101gh\u0101cha: \u2018Pull my hand.\u2019 She pulled, and my hand came out. My strength went and I cried. (15b) Then they brought the bone-setter and when he had bound up my hand, the Emperor went to \u0100gra.\n\nAfter his arrival, word was brought that the begams were on the way from K\u0101bul. My royal father went as far as Naugr\u0101m to give honourable reception to my dearest lady (*aka-j\u0101nam*),\u00b3 who was my oldest paternal aunt and my royal father\u2019s eldest sister. All the begams who had come with her, paid their duty to the Emperor in her quarters. They were very happy and made the prostration of thanks, and then set off for \u0100gra. The Emperor gave houses to all the begams.\n\nA few days later he made an excursion to the Gold-scattering Garden (*B\u0101gh-i-zar-afshan*). There was a place in it for ablution before prayers. When he saw it, he said: \u2018My heart is bowed down by ruling and reigning; I will retire to this garden. As for attendance, T\u0101hir the ewer-bearer will amply suffice. I will make over the kingdom to Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\u2019 On this my lady (*ak\u0101m*) and all his children broke down, and said with tears: \u2018God keep you in His own peace upon the throne many, many years, and may all your children after you reach a good old age!\u2019 (16a)\n\nA few days later Alwar Mirz\u0101 fell ill. His illness led to an affection of the bowels, which grew worse and worse in spite of all that the doctors could do, and at last he passed from this transitory world to the eternal home. His Majesty was very sad and sorry, and Alwar\u2019s mother, Dil-d\u0101r Begam, was wild with grief for the child, who was a\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 \u201cPerhaps a space enclosed by a low railing.\u201d (Mems., 202 n.)

As her lamentation passed due bounds, his Majesty said to my lady and the begams: 'Come, let us make an excursion to Dholpur.' He himself went comfortably and pleasantly by water, and the begams also begged to go by boat.\n\nJust then there came a letter from Maul\u0101n\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Fargh\u0101r\u012b (Pargh\u0101l\u012b) in Dihli, saying: 'Hum\u0101y\u016bn Mirz\u0101 is ill and in an extraordinary state. Her Highness the begam should come at once to Dihli, for the mirz\u0101 is much prostrated.'\u00b9 (16b)\n\nMy lady was very much upset on hearing this news, and started for Dihli, like one athirst who is far from the waters. They met in Mathura. To her experienced eye he seemed ten times weaker and more alarmingly ill than she had heard he was. From Mathura the two, mother and son, like Jesus and Mary, set out for \u0100gra. When they arrived, this insignificant one went with her own sisters to visit that royal angel of goodness.\n\nHe was then growing weaker and weaker. Every time he came to his senses, his pearl-dropping tongue asked for us, and said: 'Sisters, you are welcome! Come, and let us embrace one another. I have not embraced you.' It might be three times that he raised his head and that his jewel-dropping tongue let fall these uplifting words.\n\nWhen his Majesty came and saw how it was, his light-revealing countenance at once became sad and pitiful, and he began more and more to show signs of dread. (17a) On this my lady said: 'Do not be troubled about my son. You are a king; what griefs have you? You have other sons. I sorrow because I have only this one.'\u00b2 His Majesty rejoined: 'M\u0101ham! although I have other sons, I love none as I love your Hum\u0101y\u016bn. I crave that this\n\n\u00b9 Cf.

He kept up that going-round from the Wednesday and made intercession from the Tuesday, in anxiety and deep dejection. The weather was extremely hot and his heart and liver burned. While going round he prayed, saying in effect: \u2018O God! if a life may be exchanged for a life, I who am B\u0101bar, I give my life and my being for Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\u2019\u00b2\n\nThat very day he fell ill, and Hum\u0101y\u016bn poured water on his head, and came out and gave audience. (17b) Because of his illness, they carried my royal father within, and he kept his bed for two or three months.\n\nAs he grew worse, a messenger was sent to summon his Majesty Hum\u0101y\u016bn, who had gone towards Kalinjar. He came post-haste, and on paying his duty to the Emperor, noticed that he was very feeble. Filled with compassion, he began to break down, and kept saying to the attendants: \u2018How has he come to such a lamentable pass all at once?\u2019 He sent for the doctors, and said to them: \u2018I left him well. What has happened all at once?\u2019 They said this and that in reply.\n\n\u00b9 The account of B\u0101bar\u2019s self-surrender which follows is somewhat puzzling to translate, but the sense is clear and the important statements are in accordance with other sources.\n\n\u00b2 One of Kehr\u2019s (Ilminsky\u2019s) \u2018fragments\u2019 (which, if it be not B\u0101bar\u2019s own, it is not improbable was added to the T\u016bz\u016bk by Jah\u0101ng\u012br) tells this story in B\u0101bar\u2019s person. After rejection of the suggestion to sacrifice for Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s life the great diamond (? the Koh-i-n\u016br), the narrative continues (P. de C., II. 460.): \u2018J\u2019entrai dans la chambre o\u00f9 il se tenait, et je tournai trois fois autour de lui, en commen\u00e7ant par la t\u00eate et en disant, \u201cJ\u2019assume sur moi tout ce que tu souffres.\u201d En m\u00eame instant je me sentis tout alourdi, tandis que lui se trouvait l\u00e9ger et dispos. Il se leva en pleine sant\u00e9, et moi je m\u2019affaisse, accabl\u00e9 de malaise.\u2019\n\nFaith in the rite of circumambulation still prevails in Persia. B\u0101bar, it is clear, believed his devotion to have borne fruit. (Cf. Hughes, Dict. of Isl\u0101m, s.v. Intercession. For Kar\u012bmu-l-l\u0101h, see Bad\u0101y\u016bn\u012b, Bib. Ind. Text, III. 191.).\nThe whole time my royal father kept repeating: 'Where is Hind\u0101l? What is he doing?' Just at this time some-one came in and said: 'M\u012br Bard\u012b Beg, the son of M\u012br Khurd Beg,\\(^1\\) conveys his obeisance.' My royal father, full of agitation, sent for him at once and asked: 'Where is Hind\u0101l? When will he come? What trouble waiting gives!' (18a) M\u012br Bard\u012b said: 'The fortunate prince has reached Dihl\u012b; he will wait on you to-day or to-morrow.' On this my royal father said to M\u012br Bard\u012b Beg: 'Ill-fated little fellow! I have heard that they married your sister in K\u0101bul, and you in L\u0101h\u014dr.\\(^2\\) It is because of the wedding festivities that you have (not)\\(^3\\) sooner brought my son, and so my weary waiting has been very long.' He asked: 'How tall has Hind\u0101l M\u012brz\u0101 grown?' and 'What is he like?' As M\u012br Bard\u012b was wearing one of the m\u012brz\u0101's dresses, he showed it and said: 'This is a robe of the prince which he bestowed on his servant.' His Majesty called him nearer and said: 'Let me see how tall and how big Hind\u0101l has grown.'\\(^4\\) He kept repeating, 'Alas! a thousand times alas! that I do not see Hind\u0101l,' and asking everyone who came in: 'When will Hind\u0101l come?'\n\nDuring his illness, he laid a command on my lady, and said: 'Marriages ought to be arranged for Gul-rang Begam and Gul-chihra Begam. (18b) When the royal aunt, my elder sister,\\(^5\\) honours me with a visit, tell her that I say it has occurred to me to give Gul-rang to Is\u0101n-tim\u016br Sult\u0101n and Gul-chihra to T\u016bkhta-b\u016bgh\u0101 Sult\u0101n.'\\(^6\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Hind\u0101l's guardian from birth (1519-1530). He had previously been B\u0101bar's bak\u0101wal (house-steward). One of his sons, Khw\u0101ja T\u0101hir Muhammad, served under Hum\u0101y\u016bn and Akbar, and was m\u012br far\u0101ghat (master of comfort). He may be the M\u012br Bard\u012b (q.y. a child's sobriquet, Master Full-of-fun) of this episode. T\u0101hir's son, B\u0101qi, was a sewer, i.e., table-decker (sufra-chi).\n\n\\(^2\\) Hind\u0101l, with whom doubtless M\u012br Bard\u012b and his father were travelling, was on his way from Badakhsh\u0101n to the court.\n\n\\(^3\\) The text has no negative.\n\n\\(^4\\) Hind\u0101l was now about eleven years old, so M\u012br Bard\u012b must also have been a boy.\n\n\\(^5\\) Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam\u2014aka j\u0101nam\u2014dearest lady.\n\n\\(^6\\) Is\u0101n (Ish\u0101n, or Yussun) was the ninth, and T\u016bkhta-b\u016bgh\u0101 the tenth, son of Al\u012bmad Kh\u0101n, B\u0101bar's maternal uncle. They were uncles of Gul-badan's own husband, Khizr Khw\u0101ja.\nDearest lady, the smiling one, came, and they said to her: \u2018The Emperor spoke in this manner, and it has occurred to him in such a way. It now remains to know your pleasure. Let it be as you wish.\u2019 She said the same and, \u2018God grant blessing and peace! His idea is very good.\u2019 My chicha herself and Badi\u2018u-l-jam\u0101l Begam and \u0100q Begam, both of whom were paternal aunts of his Majesty, were conducted into the hall. Having raised an estrade and spread carpets and chosen a propitious hour, M\u0101ham\u2019s nanacha made both sult\u0101ns bow the knee in order to exalt them to the rank of sons-in-law.\n\nMeantime his Majesty\u2019s disorder of the bowels increased. The Emperor Hum\u0101y\u016bn broke down again when he saw his father\u2019s condition worsen, and called the doctors, and said to them: \u2018Think it well over and find some remedy.\u2019\n\nHaving consulted together, they said: \u2018Small is our\n\n---\n\n1 tabassum kun\u0101n.\n2 This T\u00fcrk\u012b word presents great difficulty.\nVamb\u00e9ry has jicha, Kirghiz, mother, and chicha, aunt (inferentially maternal); Shaw, chich\u0101, Q\u0101zz\u0101q, mother. P. de Courteille, Dict., chicha, an elder sister. The word has in Samarqand the meaning \u2018maternal aunt.\u2019\n\nIt occurs again in the text (23a), and is used for Gul-badan\u2019s sisters, the brides of this page (19a); so that it may be right (spite of the singular number) to read \u2018my elder sisters themselves\u2019\u2014i.e., the brides. But it might be \u2018my mother.\u2019\n\nThe word occurs at least once in the Memoirs. (Ilm., 446; Ers., 387.) It is preceded by one which Ilminsky writes yanka, and Erskine Bikeh (Bega). The letters of both words might be identical and the points only decisive. Shaw says yang\u0101 is an elder brother\u2019s wife; Vamb\u00e9ry, belle-s\u0153ur, Schwagerin; and Erskine (208 n.), bridesmaid, by which, I believe, is meant one who leads the bride to the bridegroom\u2014an exactly appropriate use here, since \u1e24ab\u012bba yang\u0101 brings her daughter Ma\u2019s\u016bma to marry B\u0101bar. (N.B.\u2014Shaw writes yang\u0101 and chich\u0101, where Vamb\u00e9ry and others have a final \u2018round h\u0101.\u2019)\n\nBut if the chicha of Mem., 387, is to be read \u2018elder sister,\u2019 B\u0101bar can apply it only to Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam (elsewhere called by him aulugh \u012bg\u0101ch\u012b (Ilm., 116.); and this would, I believe, make the reading of Bikeh (Bega) difficult, since Kh\u0101nz\u0101da could not be called anything less than Kh\u0101nam. The same objection would apply to the reading of chicha as mother or as maternal aunt. This inclines one to read yanka, and not bikeh, at Mem., 387; and the Zainab of the sentence may be granddaughter (nab\u012bra), through the female line, of the belle-s\u0153ur, or bridesmaid, of Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam. But nothing is clear as to the relationship.\n\n3 Text, suf\u0101 d\u0101da.

We hope that God, the most Holy, will soon give one from His invisible treasures.'\n\nWhen they felt his Majesty's pulse, they came to the opinion that there were symptoms of the same poison as that given him by Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm's mother. It was in this way: that ill-fated demon (the mother) gave a t\u014dla of poison to one of her maids, and said: 'Take this and give it to Al\u012bmad the taster and tell him to put it in some way or other into the special dishes prepared for the Emperor.' And she promised him large rewards. The ill-fated demon did this although his Majesty used to call her \"mother,\" and had assigned her place and lands with every favour, and had been kindly pleased to say: 'Consider me as in the place of Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm.' But as ignorance prevails amongst those people, she did not regard his kindnesses. The (fitting) hemistich is well known:\n\n'Everything reverts to its original type,\n(Whether pure gold, or silver, or tin).'\n\nTo cut short the story: the cook (Heaven having made him blind and deaf,) spread the poison which had been brought and given to him, on the Emperor's bread only, and so little was eaten. But the symptoms of this illness were like that one's, seeing that day by day he lost strength and became more and more emaciated.(19b) Every day the disorder increased and his blessed countenance changed.\n\nNext day he called his chiefs together and spoke after this wise: 'For years it has been in my heart to make over my throne to Hum\u0101y\u016bn M\u012brz\u0101 and to retire to the Gold-scattering Garden. By the Divine grace I have obtained all things but the fulfilment of this wish in health of body. Now, when illness has laid me low, I charge you all to acknowledge Hum\u0101y\u016bn in my stead.

His own blessed eyes also filled with tears.\n\nWhen his family and the people within the haram heard of these occurrences, they were stupefied and overwhelmed, and cried and lamented.\n\nThree days later he passed from this transitory world to the eternal home. The death took place on Monday, December 26th, 1530 (Jum\u0101da I. 5th, 937H.). (20a)\n\nThey brought out our paternal aunt\u00b9 and our mothers\u00b2 on the pretence that the doctors were coming to look. All rose. They took all the begams and my mothers to the Great House.\u00b3\n\nBlack fell the day for children and kinsfolk and all. They bewailed and lamented; voices were uplifted in weeping; there was utter dejection. Each passed that ill-fated day in a hidden corner.\n\nThe death was kept concealed. After a time Araish Kh\u0101n,\u2014he was an am\u012br of Hind,\u2014said: 'It is not well to keep the death secret, because when such misfortunes befall kings in Hind\u016bst\u0101n, it is the custom of the b\u0101z\u0101r people to rob and steal; God forbid that the Mughals not knowing, they should come and loot the houses and dwelling-places. It would be best to dress someone in red, and to set him on an elephant, and to let him proclaim that the Emperor B\u0101bar has become a dervish and has given his throne to the Emperor Hum\u0101y\u016bn.' This his Majesty Hum\u0101y\u016bn ordered to be done. People were at once reassured by the proclamation, and all offered prayers for\n\n\u00b9 Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam.\n\u00b2 B\u0101bar's wives.\n\u00b3 Perhaps 'palace,' and the sense may be that they did not go to their separate residences but remained nearer to the dead.\nhis welfare. On Friday, December 29th, 1530 (Jum\u0101da I. 9th, 937H.), the Emperor Hum\u0101y\u016bn mounted the throne, and everyone said: \u2018May all the world be blessed under his rule.\u2019 (20b)\n\nAfter that he came to visit his mothers and sisters and his own people, and he made inquiry after their health and offered sympathy, and spoke with kindness and commiseration. He was pleased to order: \u2018Let each keep the office, and service, and lands, and residence which he has had, and let him serve in the old way.\u2019\n\nOn the same day Hind\u0101l M\u012brz\u0101, having come from K\u0101bul, paid his homage to the Emperor, who received him with kindness, and was very happy, and bestowed on him many things from the treasures left by their father.\n\nAfter my royal father\u2019s death, there were the good works and consecrated days of the first assembly\u00b9 at his tomb.\u00b2 His Majesty named Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Al\u012b \u2018asas\u00b3 its guardian, and ordered the appointment of sixty good reciters of the whole Qur\u0101n and readers with good voices, so that the congregational prayers might be said five times daily and the whole Qur\u0101n recited, and prayer offered for the soul of the royal dweller in Paradise (Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u012b). (21a) The whole of S\u012bkri\u2014now known as Fathp\u016br\u2014together with five laks charged on Bay\u0101na, was given as an endowment to the\n\n\u00b9 ma\u2019rka. Raverty (Afgh\u0101n Dict.) gives as the first meaning of this word \u2018a party of ambassadors, or persons sent to make peace between two tribes\u2019; and, secondly, as \u2018the business of making peace, or an arrangement between two tribes.\u2019 Lane and other writers render it \u2018battle-field\u2019 and \u2018battle,\u2019 etc. Steingass adds \u2018hubbub, turmoil\u2019 (modern colloquial). Gul-badan uses it for the common social assemblies she names, and here for the gathering of relations at a tomb.\n\n\u00b2 B\u0101bar\u2019s body was laid first in the R\u0101m or Ar\u0101m B\u0101gh (Garden of Rest), on the opposite side of the river from the present T\u0101j-mah\u0101ll. Later it was taken to K\u0101bul. Mr. Erskine (B. & M., I. 517 et seq.) quotes a charming passage from Burns\u2019 \u2018Travels in Bokh\u0101r\u0101\u2019 (II. 121 et seq.), which describes B\u0101bar\u2019s self-chosen resting-place. He follows this by an eloquent estimate of B\u0101bar\u2019s character which makes clear his regret in bidding farewell to the great and vivid personality he has so admirably set before his readers.\n\n\u00b3 i.e., of the night-guard. I believe he was the brother of M\u0101ham Begam.\ntomb, for the support of the men of learning ('ulam\u0101) and the reciters who were attached to it.\n\nMy lady made an allowance of food twice daily: in the morning an ox and two sheep and five goats, and at afternoon prayer-time five goats. She gave this from her own estate during the two and a half years that she remained in the prison of this world.\n\nDuring my lady's life I used to see his Majesty in her residence. When she fell into bad health, she said to me: 'It will be very hard that when I am gone, the Emperor B\u0101bar's daughters should see their brother in Bib\u012b Gurbarg's\u00b9 house.' Just as though her words were in the royal heart and mind, his Majesty used always, so long as he was in Hind\u016bst\u0101n, to come to our house. He used to visit us and showed us kindness and affection and favour without stint. He used to come to the house of this insignificant one, and there would come Ma's\u016bma Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Begam, and Gul-rang Begam, and Gul-chihra Begam,\u00b2 etc.\u2014all the married ladies\u2014and pay their duty to him. (21b)\n\nIn short, after the death of my royal father and my lady, his Majesty, in the fulness of his affection, showed this broken one such favour, and spoke with such boundless compassion to this helpless one, that she did not know she was orphaned and headless.\u00b3\n\nDuring the ten\u2074 years after the death of his Majesty Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u012b that his Majesty Jannat-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b was in Hind, the people dwelt in repose and safety, and obedience and loyalty.\u2075\n\nSix months after the death of his Majesty Firdaus-\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Cf. post. 29b, and 'Biographical Appendix,' s.n..\n\u00b2 These three were her half and full sisters respectively.\n\u00b3 Gul-badan was about eight at her father's death. At three she had been adopted by M\u0101ham Begam.\n\u2074 Really about nine.\n\u2075 This rose-coloured picture accords neither with the facts nor with the narrative of Gul-badan. It may be that some limiting word has slipped out; e.g., 'in \u0100gra;' or 'the people of the country,' in opposition to the dispossessed Afgh\u0101ns, conquerors of earlier date, or B\u0101bar's people, i.e., household.\nmak\u0101n\u012b, Biban\\(^1\\) and B\u0101yazid advanced from the direction of Gaur. On the news of this, his Majesty at once left \u0100gra and moved to meet them. He defeated them, and then went to Chan\u0101da (Chun\u0101r),\\(^2\\) took it, and thence returned to \u0100gra.\n\nMy lady, who was M\u0101ham Begam, had a great longing and desire to see a son of Hum\u0101y\u016bn. Wherever there was a good-looking and nice girl, she used to bring her into his service. Maywa-j\u0101n, a daughter of Khadang (? Khazang), the chamberlain (yas\u0101wal),\\(^3\\) was in my employ. One day (after) the death of his Majesty Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u012b,\\(^4\\) my lady said: \u2018Hum\u0101y\u016bn, Maywa-j\u0101n is not bad. Why do you not take her into your service?\u2019 So, at her word, Hum\u0101y\u016bn married and took her that very night.\\(^{(22a)}\\)\n\nThree days later Bega Begam\\(^5\\) came from K\u0101bul. She became in the family way. In due time\\(^6\\) she had a daughter, whom they named \u2018Aq\u012bqa. Maywa-j\u0101n said to Lady (Aka) M\u0101ham Begam, \u2018I am in the family way, too.\u2019 Then my lady got ready two sets of weapons, and said: \u2018Whichever of you bears a son, I will give him good arms.\u2019 Then she packed up the arms, and got ready gold and silver walnuts. She procured also the (special) arms of a Mughal commander, and was very happy, and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Text, Bibban.

Maywa-j\u0101n said: 'My maternal aunt was in Mirz\u0101 Ulugh Beg's haram. She had a son in the twelfth month; perhaps I am like her.' So they sewed tents and filled pillows.

It can hardly be true that India waited for M\u0101ham to instruct it in the art of illumination or decoration. I have conjecturally read that, whereas formerly only b\u0101z\u0101rs were made to look festive, she had other houses adorned.\n4 Here follows a list of arrangements, plenishing and gifts for the feast.

Nai Kh\u016bb Sult\u0101n lost his sight, but the man who had the blinding of Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n did not injure his eyes.\\(^7\\) Mu\u1e25ammad-zam\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 and Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The feast here credited to M\u0101ham Begam may be that of the first anniversary of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s accession. Of this Gul-badan gives an account, minus such details as are set down here, at 24a et seq..\n\nAt the \u2018accession feast,\u2019 held December 19th, 1531, and thus not quite a year after the accession, it is said by Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn Ahmad that 12,000 robes were bestowed, 2,000 of these being \u2018special.\u2019 For details as to khil\u2019at, cf. Memoirs, 274 n..\n\nLists are dull reading, unless each item calls up an image. It is easy to add splendour and beauty to Gul-badan\u2019s few poor words by looking at actual things of the kinds she names, as may be done in the Oriental Section of the South Kensington Museum. The links between Persia and India in her day and earlier and later were many and close. Many Persians born and bred in Persia or by descent formed part of the Mughal court. Persian art and manufacture were at their highest development, experts say, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The uncritical eye doubts if the products of those centuries, as exhibited in the examples England possesses, can be excelled for splendour and satisfying charm. With such things the personages of our begam\u2019s book surrounded themselves.\n\n\\(^2\\) Son of B\u0101d\u012b\u2019u-z-zam\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101, and grandson of Sult\u0101n Husain M\u012brz\u0101 B\u0101yqr\u0101, and husband of Ma\u2019s\u016bma, a daughter of B\u0101bar. He was drowned in the Ganges at the rout of Chausa.\n\n\\(^3\\) Cf. B. & H., II., s.n..\n\n\\(^4\\) Sic; apparently the names of his fellow-rebels are omitted. They occur below.\n\n\\(^5\\) Grandson, through a daughter, of Sult\u0101n Husain M\u012brz\u0101 B\u0101yqr\u0101, and thus, a cousin of Mu\u1e25ammad-zam\u0101n.\n\n\\(^6\\) Called both Nai and Wali in the histories.\n\n\\(^7\\) See Mr. Erskine\u2019s interesting note on blinding. (B. & H., II. 14 n.).\nwith his sons, Ulugh Mirz\u0101 and Sh\u0101h M\u012brz\u0101, made their escape a few days later.\n\nThere was perpetual disturbance from these people during the years we were in Hind.\n\nWhen his Majesty returned from the campaign against Biban and B\u0101yazid, he was in \u0100gra\u00b9 for about a year. He said to my lady: \u2018I am sad at heart in these days. If you approved, I would go with you to Gu\u0101li\u0101r.\u2019\u00b2 Her Highness my lady, and my mother (\u0101jam),\u00b3 and my sisters Ma\u015f\u016bma\u2074 Sul\u011f\u0101n Begam, whom we used to call Elder sister\u2075 Moon, and Gul-rang Begam, whom we used to call Elder sister Rose,\u2014we all were in Gu\u0101li\u0101r in attendance on the beneficent ladies.\u2076\n\nAs Gul-chihra Begam was in Oude, and her husband, T\u016bkht\u0101-b\u016bgh\u0101 Sult\u0101n, went to the mercy of God, her attendants wrote to his Majesty from Oude and said: \u2018T\u016bkht\u0101-b\u016bgh\u0101 Sult\u0101n is dead. (23b) What is the order about the begam?\u2019 His Majesty said to M\u012br Z\u0101ycha:\u2077 \u2018Go and bring the begam to \u0100gra. We also are going there.\u2019\n\nAt this time her Highness my lady said: \u2018If you approve, I will send for Bega Begam and \u2018Aqiqa, so that they also may see Gu\u0101li\u0101r.\u2019 She despatched Nauk\u0101r\u2078 and Khw\u0101ja Kab\u012br, who brought them from \u0100gra.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 \u2018Occupied in dreamy speculations of false sciences\u2019\u2014i.e., astrology. (B. & H., II. 14.) The date is 1584 (941H.).\n\n\u00b2 The histories tell us that the Gu\u0101li\u0101r expedition was a military demonstration against Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h of Gujrat. Khw\u0101nd-am\u012br fixes its date as Sha'b\u0101n 989H. (February, 1583).\n\n\u00b3 Taken as it is written, this name might be charmingly translated as \u2018Ma desiree,\u2019 but considered with other words in this text after which the enclitic am (my) is incorrectly written, it seems that prosaic \u2018my mother,\u2019 T\u00fcrki, aeh\u0101m, is safer. In favour, however, of reading \u0101jam, desire, is the wording on 25b (No. 48 of the guest-list), \u0101jam w\u0101lida-i-m\u0101t, our mother. \u0100jam occurs also at 29b.\n\n\u2074 Her husband, Mu\u1e25ammad-zam\u0101n, is the rebel of this name just spoken of.\n\n\u2075 Ch\u012bcha; which I have rendered \u2018elder sister\u2019 to suit the actual relationship between Gul-badan and her two sisters. Cf. 18b n..\n\n\u2076 The aunts, presumably.\n\n\u2077 The Chief Astrologer.\n\n\u2078 B\u0101bar names this man as being sent from India in charge of gifts to K\u0101bul (Mems., 387.), and Gul-badan names him again (67b) as guardian of the begams\u2019 doorway in the citadel of K\u0101bul.\nThey let two months slip by in one another's company in Gu\u0101l\u012b\u0101r, and then set out for \u0100gra, which they reached in February, 1534 (Sha'b\u0101n, 940 H.).\u00b9\n\nIn April (Shaww\u0101l) my lady was attacked by a disorder of the bowels. On the 27th of the same month (13th Shaww\u0101l) she passed from this transitory life to the eternal home.\n\nThe stamp of orphanhood was set anew on my royal father's children, and especially on me, for whom she herself had cared. I felt lonely and helpless and in great affliction. Day and night I wept and mourned and grieved. His Majesty came several times to comfort me, and showed me sympathy and kindness. I was two years old when her Highness my lady took me into her own house and cared for me, and I was ten when she departed from this life. (24a) I remained one year more in her house.\u00b2 When I was eleven, and his Majesty went to Dholp\u016br, I\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 This date cannot be right. The following are approximately correct for this time: Visit to Gu\u0101l\u012b\u0101r undertaken, Sha'b\u0101n, 939H. (February, 1533). Return to \u0100gra and M\u0101h\u0101m's illness, Shaww\u0101l (April). Death of M\u0101h\u0101m, 13th Shaww\u0101l (May 8, 1533). Forty days of mourning carries on the time to late in Z\u016b'l-q\u0101'ida (June). Start for Dihli, beginning of Z\u016b'l-hijja,\u2014after June 24. The building of Dinpan\u0101 was begun Muharram, 940H. (July, 1533).\n\n\u00b2 M\u0101h\u0101m had also adopted Hind\u0101l. B\u0101bar details the circumstances, but the abbreviation, as it seems, of the Persian text, has led to an error. (Memoirs., 250.) Those children of B\u0101bar who died young, were not born in 'this year' (925H.), as will be seen in the fuller rendering of Ilminsky, 281, and of P. de C., II. 44: 'Apr\u00e8s Hum\u0101y\u016bn (b. 913H.) j'eus encore plusieurs enfants, n\u00e9s de la m\u00eame m\u00e8re que lui, mais qui ne v\u00e9curent pas.'\n\nWe know from Gul-b\u0101dan that these were B\u0101rb\u016bl, Mihr-jah\u0101n, and Ish\u0101n-daulat.\n\n'Hind\u0101l n'\u00e9tait pas encore venu dans le monde. Comme j'\u00e9tais dans ces parages [Kehr\u0101j, in Mandesh, and on his way to India], il m'arriva une lettre de M\u0101h\u0101m, dans laquelle elle me disait, \"Sera-ce un fils ou une fille? Prononcez vous-m\u00eame sur la part que me r\u00e9serve la fortune; \u00e0 moi de mettre l'enfant dans le monde [Erskine, 'I will regard the child as mine'] et de l'\u00e9lever.\" Le vendredi, 26 du mois, toujours \u00e0 ce m\u00eame campement, j'adjugeai Hind\u0101l \u00e0 M\u0101h\u0101m [before birth] et je lui \u00e9crivis \u00e0 ce sujet une lettre qui lui fut port\u00e9e \u00e0 K\u0101bul par Y\u016bsuf 'Ali rik\u0101b-d\u0101r [courier] quoique Hind\u0101l ne f\u00fbt pas encore n\u00e9.'\n\nA passage now follows which, as is noted by P. de C., is neither in the Persian version of the Memoirs nor in the English translation:\n\n'Pour bien comprendre tout ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit plus haut, il faut savoir que jusqu'\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, de tout les enfants n\u00e9s de la m\u00eame m\u00e8re\naccompanied my mother. This will have been before he went to Gu\u0101l\u012b\u0101r and began to build.\n\nAt the end of the mourning for my lady, his Majesty went to Dihli and began to build the fort of D\u012bn-pa\u1e47\u0101. He then returned to \u0100gra.\n\nDearest lady (Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam) said to his Majesty: \u2018When will you make M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l\u2019s marriage feast?\u2019 His\n\nque Hum\u0101y\u016bn, soit un fils [i.e., B\u0101rb\u016bl], cadet par rapport \u00e0 lui, l\u2019a\u00een\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 mes autres enfants et trois filles, dont l\u2019une \u00e9tait Mihrj\u0101n, il n\u2019y en avait pas un qui ne f\u00fbt mort en bas \u00e2ge. Je souhaitais vivement de lui voir na\u00eetre un fr\u00e8re ou une s\u0153ur. [i.e., a child of M\u0101ham. There were other children of other wives.]\n\n\u2018Pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque Dil-d\u0101r \u0101gh\u0101cha se trouvait enceinte. Je ne cessais de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter, \u201cPl\u00fbt \u00e0 Dieu que l\u2019enfant qui va na\u00eetre, sortit du m\u00eame sein que Hum\u0101y\u016bn!\u201d \u00c0 quoi ma m\u00e8re [sic. T\u00fcrk\u012b text, Ilminsky, 271, h\u0101zrat w\u0101lida] me r\u00e9pondait, \u201cSi Dil-d\u0101r \u0101gh\u0101cha met au monde un fils, ne pourrais-je le prendre et m\u2019en charger?\u201d \u201cRien de mieux,\u201d faisais-je \u00e0 mon tour.\n\n\u2018D\u2019ordinaire les femmes ont la mani\u00e8re suivante de consulter le sort, quand elles veulent savoir si elles auront un fils ou une fille. Elles prennent deux morceaux de papier; sur l\u2019un elles \u00e9crivent, \u2018\u0100li ou \u1e24asan, sur l\u2019autre F\u0101\u1e6dima; puis elles les placent dans deux boules de limon qu\u2019elles mettent dans une coupe d\u2019eau. Celles des deux qui s\u2019ouvre la premi\u00e8re, leur sert \u00e0 prognostiquer l\u2019avenir; si elle renferme le nom d\u2019un gar\u00e7on, il y aura un gar\u00e7on; si c\u2019est celui d\u2019une fille, il y aura une fille, disent-elles. On employa cette m\u00e9thode; ce fut un enfant m\u00e2le qui en sortit. En recevant cette bonne nouvelle, j\u2019\u00e9crivis aussit\u00f4t pour en faire part \u00e0 ma m\u00e8re [sic]. Quelques jours plus tard, effectivement Dieu me donna un gar\u00e7on. Trois jours apr\u00e8s sa naissance et avant de l\u2019annoncer, on enleva l\u2019enfant, bon gr\u00e9, mal gr\u00e9, \u00e0 sa m\u00e8re et on l\u2019apporta chez moi o\u00f9 on le garda. Lorsque j\u2019en donnai avis \u00e0 ma m\u00e8re [sic], celle-ci apprenant qu\u2019elle avait obtenu l\u2019objet de ses v\u0153ux, donna au jeune prince le nom de Hind\u0101l, qui \u00e9tait pour nous de bon augure. Par cet arrangement cet enfant f\u00fbt pour moi [?] nous \u00e0 la fois un fr\u00e8re cadet (for Hum\u0101y\u016bn) et un fils (for M\u0101ham and himself).\n\nThe words h\u0101zrat w\u0101lida cannot mean the mother of B\u0101bar. She had been dead some fourteen years. They may be equivalent to Sult\u0101n-w\u0101lida\u2014i.e., the mother of the heir-apparent. Certainly it was M\u0101ham who adopted Hind\u0101l. This initial misconception as to the identity of Hazrat w\u0101lida runs through the whole translation of this most interesting passage. According to Gul-badan, F\u0101r\u016bq (born in 932H.) was M\u0101ham\u2019s son. B\u0101bar names the birth. (Mems., 343.)\n\n1 i.e., returned to her own mother\u2019s charge i.e., Dil-d\u0101r\u2019s.\n\n2 An obscure passage. Hum\u0101y\u016bn was building about this time. (Elliot, V. 126.)\n\n3 Beginning of Z\u016bl-hijja, 939H. (June\u2014July, 1533).\n\n4 Hum\u0101y\u016bn-n\u0101ma, Khw\u0101nd-am\u012br. (Elliot, V. 125.)\n\n5 Cf. 15b n.,\nMajesty replied: 'B'\u012bsmu-l-l\u0101h.' When M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l was married, my lady (M\u0101ham) was living, but there was delay in arranging the feast. (Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam) said: 'The things for the Mystic Feast are also ready. Let us first celebrate this, and afterwards M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l's.' His Majesty said: 'Let whatever my royal aunt wishes be done.' She replied: 'May God bless it and make it good.'\n\n**Description of the House of Feasting which was set up on the River's Bank, and which was called the Mystic House:**\n\nFirst there was a large octagonal room with an octagonal tank in the centre, and again, in the middle of the reservoir, an octagonal platform on which were spread Persian (wil\u0101yat\u012b) carpets. (24b) Young men and pretty girls and elegant women and musicians and sweet-voiced reciters were ordered to sit in the tank.\n\nThe jewelled throne which my lady had given for the feast was placed in the fore-court of the house, and a gold-embroidered divan was laid in front of it, (on which) his Majesty and dearest lady sat together.\n\nOn her right sat her paternal aunts, the daughters of Sult\u0101n Ab\u016b-sa'id M\u012brz\u0101:\n\n1.

Perhaps an epithet drifted from astrological phraseology. This feast commemorated the accession of Hun\u0101y\u016bn. Cf. Hum\u0101y\u016bn-n\u0101ma, trs. Sada-s\u016bkh La'l (B.M. Add. 30,774, p. 76.) : 'talismanic palace,' which may be the building named by Gul-badan. Cf. 'samite, mystic,' of Tennyson. Khw\u0101nd-am\u012br speaks at length of this feast in his Hum\u0101y\u016bn-n\u0101ma, and calls the building in which it was held 'im\u0101rat-i-tilism.'\n\n2 The sequel to this order follows later.\n\n3 *t\u016bshak*, (?) anglice, squab.\n\n4 Translator's numbering.

Sal\u012bqa married a son of Sultan Mahm\u016bd Mirz\u0101, and may have acted under the evil impulses of the family quarrels which did so much to embitter, if also to stimulate, B\u0101bar\u2019s early ambitions.\n\n\u00b2 This is not \u2018my lady,\u2019 whose death has been already recorded.\n\n\u00b3 kil\u0101n; perhaps, great.\n21.

B\u0101bar's account of \u1e24aidar's accomplishments (Ilminsky, 14, Mem., 18, P. de C., 22.), and \u1e24aidar's own recital in his prologue to the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-rash\u012bd\u012b.\n\nI suggest to take t\u0101rash\u012b (a word not used by B\u0101bar or \u1e24aidar) as equivalent to the fletchery (auq), or the \u2018making arrow-heads\u2019 (paik\u0101n), of B\u0101bar.\n\nAnother possible reading has been suggested to me by Mr. Beveridge \u2014(a)z hik\u012br\u012b tar\u0101sh\u012b, \u2018by cutting arrows.\u2019 Hik\u012br\u012b is a Hind\u012b name for cultivated reeds grown on low marshy grounds. (Wilson\u2019s Glossary, s.v., and Platt\u2019s Hindust\u0101ni Dict.) There is nothing improbable in Gul-badan\u2019s use of a Hind\u012b word. Arrows were fashioned from these reeds and men-at-arms practised the art. Gujrat reeds were exported for arrows to Persia. The omission of the alif of az is not infrequent in the MS..\n\nA few words on the zih-gir find fit insertion here. It is a thumb-ring worn on the right hand as a protection against the fret of the bow-string both in drawing and release. Persians, like the Japanese and Mongols and Chinese, drew with the thumb. The zih-gir is of eccentric\nwith the bow and arrow. They also played many musical instruments.\n\n30. Gul Begam.\n31. Fauq Begam.\n32. Kh\u0101n (?

There were also some others.\n\nAfter the Mystic Feast (938 H.) came Mirz\u0101 Hind\u0101l\u2019s wedding-feast (Jauhar, 944 H.). Some of the begams already named went away,\u00b9 and (of those) some had sat at the right hand in that assembly (i.e., the Mystic Feast).\u00b2\n\nOf our begams:\n\n37. \u0100gha (\u0100gh\u0101,\u2014passim, \u0101gha), Sult\u0101n \u0101gh\u0101cha, mother of Y\u0101dg\u0101r Sult\u0101n Begam.\n38. \u0100t\u016bn m\u0101m\u0101.\n39.

This elongation lies along the inner side of the thumb, and points towards the thumb-tip.\u00b3 In drawing, the thumb crooks round the string which pulls against the zih-g\u012br. The arrow is released by straightening the thumb, and the string then flies over the hard surface of the ring. The zih-g\u012br is of jade, crystal, ivory, brass, gold, etc.. Some are chased and carved, and some are jewelled. In December, 1898, a remarkable one was offered for sale at an auction in Edinburgh of Lord Dalhousie\u2019s collections and the jewels of his daughter, Lady S. G. Brown (Connemara). It is cut from a single emerald, and inscribed: \u2018Jihat zihg\u012br sh\u0101h-i-sh\u0101h\u0101n N\u0101dir s\u0101hib-g\u012br\u0101n bar taskh\u012br-i-hind az jaw\u0101har-kh\u0101na intikh\u0101b shud\u2019 (\u2018Selected for a thumb-ring for the king of kings and lord of happy conjunction N\u0101dir, from the jewel-room on the conquest of Hind\u2019).\n\nAn interesting account of Persian archery is included in the \u2018Book of Archery,\u2019 G. Agar Hansard (Lond., 1840.). It, however, calls the zih-g\u012br, safn. Safn is the rough skin of a fish or lizard which is used to smooth the arrow-shafts. (Cf. Lane\u2019s Ar. Dict.)\n\n\u00b3 Cf.

(26b)\n\nThis was the fashion of the Mystic House: (there was) a large octagonal room in which they gave the feast, over against this a small room, also octagonal. In both every sort of profusion and splendour appeared. In the large octagonal hall was set the jewelled throne, and above and below it were spread out hangings (ad\u1e63aqah\u0101\u012b) embroidered with gold, and wonderful strings of pearls (shadh\u012bha) hung, each 1\u00bd yards (gaz) in length. At the end of each string (lari) were two glass globes. There had been made and hung some thirty or forty strings.\n\nIn the small room, in an alcove, were set a gilded bedstead and p\u0101n-dishes,\u00b9 and water-vessels and jewelled drinking-vessels, and utensils of pure gold and silver.\n\n\u00b9 This word excites curiosity as to the time when Gul-badan's people learned to eat p\u0101n.\nFacing west (was) the audience hall; facing east, the garden; on the third side and facing south, the large octagon; and on the side facing north, the small one. In these three houses were three upper rooms.

Various fruits and beverages had been got ready, and everything for merriment and comfort and pleasure.\n\nOn the feast-day of the Mystic House, his Majesty ordered all the mirz\u0101s and begams to bring gifts,\\(^7\\) and everyone did so.

This is mine. Bring it forward.\u2019 They did so. He said: \u2018What need is there to count?\u2019 First he himself vouchsafed his blessed hand and said: \u2018Let them take to the begams on one small tray ashraf\u012bs and on another sh\u0101hrukh\u012bs. Let each person take her hands full.\u2019 What was left, that is two trays of sh\u0101hrukh\u012bs,\u2014which may have been 10,000,\u2014and all the ashraf\u012bs,\u2014about 2,000\u2014he gave in largesse, and scattered\u00b9 first before the wali \u2019u-n-ni\u2019mat\u0101n (beneficent seniors), and then to those present at the entertainment. No one received less than 100 or 150, and those in the tank especially received very much. (28a) His Majesty was pleased to say: \u2018Dearest lady! if you approved, they might put water in the tank.\u2019 She replied: \u2018Very good,\u2019 and went herself and sat at the top of the steps. People were taking no notice, when all at once (?) the tap was turned and water came. (28a) The young people got very much excited. His Majesty said: \u2018There is no harm; each of you will eat a pellet of anise\u00b2 and a bit of comfit\u00b3 and come out of there.\u2019 Upon this, everyone who would eat the comfit came out quickly. The water was as high as their ankles. To end the story, everyone ate the comfit and all came out.\n\nThen the viands of the feast were set forth, and robes of\n\n\u00b9 n\u012bs\u0101r.

Also a woman\u2019s b\u0101z\u0101r\\(^3\\) had been arranged, and boats had been decorated. In one boat was made (?) the semblance of six people (\\(kas\u012b\\)) and six alcoves (\\(kanj\\)); in (another) an upper room, and below it a garden with amaranthus and cockscombs and larkspurs\\(^4\\) and tulips. In one place there were eight boats, so that there were eight pieces.\\(^5\\)\n\nIn short, everyone was astonished and amazed who beheld what gift of contrivance the great God had bestowed on the blessed mind of his Majesty. (28b)\n\n**The Description of M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l\u2019s (Marriage) Feast is as follows:\\(^6\\)**\n\nSult\u0101nam Begam (\\(i.e.\\), the bride) was a sister of Mahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja.\\(^7\\) My father\u2019s brother-in law (\\(yazna\\)) had no child except Ja\u2019far Khw\u0101ja, and there was no child (?) of Kh\u0101n-z\u0101da Begam).\\(^8\\) Dearest lady had taken care of Sult\u0101nam\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) It was now that 12,000 \\(khil\u2019ats\\) are said to have been distributed. In this passage Gul-badan twice uses the expression \\(sar u-p\u0101\u012b\\). Perhaps one might say that the \u2018young people\u2019 were given new clothes from head to foot, and so shake off the fetters of the rigid \\(khil\u2019lat\\), \\(sar-u-p\u0101\u012b\\), and \u2018honorary dresses.\u2019\n\n\\(^2\\) The dictionaries I have seen, explain \\(t\u0101l\u0101r\\) as a saloon built of wood and supported on four columns, and this is appropriate here. Le Strange and Haggard (Vaz\u012br of Lonkur\u0101n) say, \u2018Alcove or chamber in which a ruler sits to give public audience and hear suitors.\u2019 It is raised above the level of the (\\(e.g.\\)) courtyard, so that petitioners are below the \\(hak\u012bm\\).

Sult\u0101nam was two years old when Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam took charge of her. She (Kh\u0101nz\u0101da) loved her very much, and thought of her as a brother\u2019s child of her own.

Quatrem\u00e8re uses this word twice with perhaps two meanings. (Notices et Extraits, XIV. 324, 325 and 406-8.) At p. 408 he translates it kiosques, and it seems to be a building. At pp. 324 and 406 he leaves it untranslated. (Here it may have the sense given by Gul-badan.) It is named amongst items prepared for ambassadors at a post-house. These are: \u2018kat, tr\u00f4ne; bastar, estrade; . . . kushka; jinlik; sandal\u0131, si\u00e8ge,\u2019 etc. Gul-badan might intend to name a canopy or screen for a sleeping-place in a large room or a movable kiosk with sleeping comforts.\n\n\u00b2 Cf. 22b.\n\n\u00b3 A word follows tent which I cannot make out. It resembles j-(h,ch)-l-gh (no vowels).\n\n\u2074 nim-tana, i.e., demi-corps. Like many of Gul-badan\u2019s words, this is marked by Steingass as \u2018modern colloquial.\u2019 Apropos of this, Dr. Fritz Rosen says in the preface of his Modern Persian Colloquial Grammar, that the Persian of Ir\u0101n differs \u2018in every respect\u2019 from the Persian of India. The Persian of Gul-badan allows one to feel at home with the vaz\u012br of Lonkur\u0101n, and with Dr. Rosen\u2019s own book. Perhaps the difference he indicates is between the literary and colloquial. Gul-badan\u2019s Persian, however, is presumably that of contemporary Ir\u0101n, and her teachers were probably Persian born. Dr. Rosen\u2019s remark appears to require some restriction.\n\n\u2075 tukma (d\u0101r), usually translated buttons; but the button is so associated with the button-hole as to suggest a fastening. A dressmaker might say \u2018ball-trimming.\u2019 Globular buttons were and are placed round the neck and hem of a boddice. The vaz\u012br of Lonkur\u0101n ordered a jacket with garniture of twenty-four gold buttons, smaller than a hen\u2019s and larger than a pigeon\u2019s. Vests trimmed with \u2018buttons\u2019 (Mems.) are repeatedly named by B\u0101bar as gifts.\none of emerald, one of turquoise, one of topaz, and one of cat\u2019s-eye.\n\nAgain: of necklaces, nine; and one embroidered collar and bordering, and four short jackets\\(^1\\) with ball-trimming (tukma-d\u0101r), and one pair of ruby earrings and another of pearls, three fans,\\(^2\\) and one royal umbrella.\n\nOne dirakht\\(^3\\) and two khl\u016bb\\(^3\\) and other furniture and effects, and household goods and chattels and workshops\\(^4\\) of all sorts.

My only suggestion as to their possible meaning is too slightly based to be of value. It is this: In the South Kensington Museum, Oriental Section, I have seen tall lamp-stands so shaped that they recall the Qu\u1e6db pillar outside Dihl\u012b.

It was on the 15th of the revered Rajab 941H.\\(^2\\) that he quite decided to go himself to Gujr\u0101t. He set up his advance camp in the Gold-scattering Garden, and there spent a month while the forces were gathering in.\n\nOn court days, which were Sundays and Tuesdays, he used to go to the other side of the river. During his stay in the garden, \u0101jam (Dil-d\u0101r Begam) and my sisters and the ladies (haram\u0101n) were often in his company. Of all the tents, Ma\u2019\u1e63\u016bma Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Begam\u2019s was at the top of the row. Next came Gul-rang Begam\u2019s, and \u0101jam\u2019s was in the same place.

Perhaps the begam\u2019s date is that of departure, a day liable to postponement when Hum\u0101y\u016bn was in pleasant quarters.\n\n\\(^3\\) It may be that the copyist has transferred the words \u2018my mother\u2019 from a quite usual place,\u2014preceding or following the \u0101jam of the previous sentence. They are inappropriate to Gul-barg Begam; at least, I have never seen them used to describe a brother\u2019s wife, and such I believe this Gul-barg to be. We know of a \u2018B\u012bb\u012b Gul-barg,\u2019 mentioned somewhat condescendingly (21a) by M\u0101ham Begam; I incline to take Gul-barg there and here as Khal\u012bfa\u2019s daughter, and the former wife of Mir Sh\u0101h \u1e2ausain Argh\u016bn. Cf. Appendix, s.n. Gul-barg.\n\n\\(^4\\) This is, I think, Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s wife and the mother of \u2018Aq\u012bqa. The object of Gul-badan\u2019s enumeration of the tents seems to be desire to show that B\u0101bar\u2019s daughters and widow had places of honour higher than Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s family.\norder. When they had put up the pavilions (khaima) and tents (khar-g\u0101h) and the audience tent (b\u0101r-g\u0101h), the Emperor came to see the camp and the splendid set-out, and visited the begams and his sisters. As he had dismounted somewhat near Ma's\u016bma Sult\u0101n Begam's (tent), he honoured her with a visit. All of us, the begams and my sisters, were in his society. (30a) When he went to any begam's or sister's quarters, all the begams and all his sisters used to go with him. Next day he came to the tent\\(^1\\) of this lowly person, and the entertainment lasted till the third watch\\(^2\\) of the night. Many begams were there, and his sisters, and ladies of rank (begah\u0101) and of position (\u0101gh\u0101h\u0101), and other ladies (\u0101gh\u0101chah\u0101), and musicians and reciters. After the third watch his Majesty was pleased to command repose. His sisters and the begams made resting-places (tak\u012ba) in his presence.\\(^3\\)\n\nBega Begam woke (us) up, and said: 'It is time for prayers.'\\(^4\\) His Majesty ordered water for ablution\\(^5\\) made ready where he was, and so the begam knew that he was awake. She began a complaint, and said to him: 'For several days now you have been paying visits in this garden, and on no one day have you been to our\\(^6\\) house. Thorns have not been planted in the way to it. We hope you will deign to visit our quarters also, and to have a party and a sociable gathering there, too. How long will you think it right to show all these disfavours to us helpless ones? We too have hearts. Three times you have honoured other places by visits, and you have run day and night into one in amusement and conversation.'

At the first watch of the day he came out and sent for his sisters and the begams, and for Dil-d\u0101r Begam, and Afgh\u0101n\u012b \u0101gh\u0101cha, and Gul-n\u0101r \u0101gh\u0101cha, and Meywa-j\u0101n and \u0100gh\u0101-j\u0101n, and the nurses (anagaha). We all went, and he said not a word, so everyone knew he was angry. Then after a little he began: \u2018Bibi, what ill-treatment at my hands did you complain of this morning?\u2019 and: \u2018That was not the place to make a complaint. You all (shum\u0101) know that I have been to the quarters of the elder relations (wali\u2019u-n-ni\u2019mat\u0101n) of you all (shum\u0101y\u0101n). It is a necessity laid on me to make them happy. Nevertheless, I am ashamed before them because I see them so rarely. It has long been in my mind to ask from you all a signed declaration (sijl\u012b), and it is as well that you have brought me to the speaking-point. I am an opium-eater. If there should be delay in my comings and goings, do not be angry with me. Rather, write me a letter, and say: \u201cWhether it please you to come or whether it please you not to come, we are content and are thankful to you.\u201d\u2019\n\nGul-barg Begam wrote to this effect at once, and he settled it with her.\u00b9 Bega Begam insisted a little, saying: \u2018The excuse looked worse than the fault.\u2019\u00b2 (31a) We complained in order that your Majesty might lift up our heads by your favour. Your Majesty has carried the matter to this point! What remedy have we? You are Emperor.\u2019\n\nShe wrote a letter and gave it to him, and he made it up\u00b3 with her also.\n\nOn February 18th, 1534 (Sha\u2019b\u0101n 14th, 941 H.), he set out from the Gold-scattering Garden and marched for Gujr\u0101t, to fall upon Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur. They confronted one another at Manhas\u016br (Mands\u016br); a battle was fought, and Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur, on his defeat, fled to Champ\u0101n\u012br. Then\n\n\u00b9 ba Gul-barg Begam dary\u0101ftand.\n\u00b2 A familiar proverb. Cf. Steingass, 840, s.v. \u2018azr.\n\u00b3 dary\u0101ftand. Gul-badan frequently uses this word as meaning to embrace and to greet, a sense not mentioned by Johnson or Steingass. The ba of the earlier instance (note 1.) induced me to give it the notion of coming to an understanding. Cf. 16b.\nhis Majesty resolved to pursue him. Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur left Champ\u0101n\u012br and went towards Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d.\\(^1\\) His Majesty took the country of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d also, and portioned out the whole of Gujr\u0101t to his men. Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d he bestowed on M\u012brz\u0101 'Askar\u012b,\\(^2\\) Bahr\u016bch on Q\u0101sim Husain Sult\u0101n,\\(^3\\) and Patan on Y\u0101dg\u0101r-n\u0101\u1e63ir M\u012brz\u0101.\\(^4\\)\n\nHe himself, with a small following, went from Champ\u0101n\u012br to visit Kanb\u0101yat\\(^5\\) (Cambay). A few days later there came a woman with news, and said: \u2018Why are you sitting here? The men of Kanb\u0101yat have gathered, and will fall upon you unless your Majesty rides off.\u2019 The royal am\u012brs attacked the rabble,\\(^6\\) and got them into their hands and cut them in pieces. \\((31b)\\)\n\nHis Majesty then went to Baroda, and from there towards Champ\u0101n\u012br.\\(^7\\) We had settled down, when there\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Taking his treasure with him, Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur fled before Hum\u0101y\u016bn to Champ\u0101n\u012br, Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, Cambay and Diu.\n\n\\(^2\\) Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s half-brother.\n\n\\(^3\\) Grandson, through a daughter, of Sult\u0101n Husain M\u012brz\u0101 B\u0101yqr\u0101; on his father\u2019s side an Uzbeg.\n\n\\(^4\\) Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s first cousin, the son of B\u0101bar\u2019s half-brother N\u0101\u1e63ir. He was a posthumous child. Mr. Beveridge has drawn my attention to the fact,\u2014of which there are other examples,\u2014that he is called Y\u0101dg\u0101r, a souvenir, of N\u0101\u1e63ir, his father.\n\n\\(^5\\) This excursion preceded the allotment of fiefs. Gul-badan\u2019s way of putting the pursuit of Bah\u0101dur is borne out by some other writers. This was Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s first sight of the sea, and the spectacle seems to have been more in her mind than was Bah\u0101dur. Akbar\u2019s first sight of the sea is also commemorated in the histories.\n\n\\(^6\\) Ab\u016b'l-fa\u017cl calls them Bhils and Gaw\u0101rs. (H.B.I.309.) They were rude tribesmen acting in Bah\u0101dur\u2019s interests. Maternal affection saved the small royal camp. The \u2018woman\u2019 had a son a slave in it, and she purchased his freedom by revealing the designs of her fellow-tribesmen. Although Cambay had not furnished the assailants, it paid in fire and pillage for the attack. It lay near, was an enemy\u2019s town, and such an incident as the onslaught of the Bhils would not allow of fine distinction of race and person.\n\n\\(^7\\) Behind this dull statement is a stirring episode. Hum\u0101y\u016bn took Champ\u0101n\u012br after a four months\u2019 blockade, by night escalade of a rock so nearly perpendicular that seventy or eighty iron spikes had to be driven in to allow ascent. Thirty-nine men climbed up. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n was the fortieth, Hum\u0101y\u016bn the forty-first of the three hundred who mounted. Such a B\u0101bar-like episode makes regret the keener that Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s life was ruined and stained by his slavery to a drug. The loot of Champ\u0101n\u012br was enormous; it had been regarded as impregnable, and was full of treasure. It was taken in 1536 (943 H.).\nwas a tumult, and Mirz\u0101 'Askari's people left Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d and came to the Emperor. They represented to him that Mirz\u0101 'Askari\\(^1\\) and Y\u0101dg\u0101r-n\u0101sir Mirz\u0101 had conspired, and wished to go to \u0100gra. On hearing this, he himself was forced to go; he left the important affairs of Gujr\u0101t [(?)] its pacification], and turned away and went to \u0100gra. Here he spent as much as a year.\\(^2\\)\n\nHe then went to Chan\u0101da (Chun\u0101r), and took it,\\(^3\\) and also Benares. Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n was in Charkanda,\\(^4\\) and made an offer of service, saying: 'I am your old servant. Give me a place with a fixed boundary in which I may establish myself.'\n\nHis Majesty was considering this, when the king of Gaur Bang\u0101la\\(^5\\) came wounded and a fugitive. For this reason he gave no attention (to Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n), but marched towards Gaur Bang\u0101la. Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n knew that his Majesty had gone there, and went himself also with a large detachment of horse, and joined his son (Jil\u0101l Kh\u0101n), who was in Gaur with his servant Khaw\u0101s Kh\u0101n. Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n sent them out, and said: 'Go and fortify Garh\u012b.'\\(^6\\) (32a)\n\nBoth came and occupied Garh\u012b. His Majesty had written to Jah\u0101ng\u012br Beg: 'Advance a stage, and go up\n\n---\n\nHum\u0101y\u016bn now relapsed into an evil mood of feasting and indolence. He remained near Champ\u0101n\u012br, and affairs entered on a recurrent phase. There was complete relaxation of discipline.\n\nGul-badan's 'we had settled down' (nishista budim) allows the inference that she and other ladies had joined the camp. A later instance will be found of the inopportune presence of women and children with the army. But it may mean merely 'we were comfortably awaiting events' in \u0100gra.\n\n\\(^1\\) He was thinking of having the khutba read in his own name in \u0100gra. Such an aspiration in Hum\u0101y\u016bn's brothers was encouraged by his own abdications of sovereignty.\n\n\\(^2\\) A fatal year which allowed Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n to gather force.

There was fighting, and Jah\u0101ng\u012br Beg was wounded and many men were slain.\n\nWhen the Emperor had spent three or four days in Kohlg\u0101n\u016b (Colgong), it became advisable for him to march on and halt near Garh\u012b. He marched forward, and when he came near Garh\u012b, Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n and Khaw\u0101\u1e63 Kh\u0101n fled by night, and he entered Garh\u012b next day. Thence he went to Gaur Bang\u0101la, and took it.\n\nHe was nine months in the far-away country of Gaur, and named it Jannat\u0101b\u0101d.\u00b9\n\nHe was comfortably and safely in Gaur, when news came that some of the am\u012brs had deserted and joined M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l.\u00b2\n\nKhusrau Beg\u00b3 (k\u016bkalt\u0101sh) and Zah\u012bd Beg\u2074 and Sayyid Am\u012br\u2075 paid their respects to the m\u012brz\u0101, and said: 'The Emperor has gone comfortably far away, and the m\u012brz\u0101s, Mu\u1e25ammad Sul\u1e6d\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 and his sons, Ulugh M\u012brz\u0101 and Sh\u0101h M\u012brz\u0101, have again raised their heads,\u2076 and continually keep showing themselves in company.'

The demoralizing effects of life in Gaur were felt under Akbar. Hum\u0101y\u016bn, with his empire crumbling around him, was now (as Jauhar testifies) 'so much devoted to pleasure and sensual enjoyment that, after the first month, he was never seen, as he was always shut up in a private apartment of the palace.' Naturally, Gul-badan's next item of narrative is of rebellion,\u2014this time by her own brother, Hind\u0101l.\n\n\u00b2 He was only nineteen, and the crown may well have seemed at anyone's service. The date is 1538 (945H.). Hum\u0101y\u016bn in Gaur was cut off from his capital by Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n.\n\n\u00b3 B\u0101bar first names him in 1507-8 as coming from Har\u0101t. There are two men named Khusrau k\u016bkalt\u0101sh by B\u0101bar, but they were not contemporaries.

For causes of Hind\u0101l's rebellion, and for Bega Begam's part in it, see Erskine's Jauhar, l.c., p. 13.\n\n\u2077 Some words seem to be omitted, e.g., 'was accused of.'

He found the armour and accoutrements, and had Bandag\u012b Shaikh Bahl\u016bl killed.\\(^2\\) The Emperor, on hearing news of it, set out for \u0100gra.\n\nHe was coming by that side of the Ganges (i.e., the left bank) opposite Mung\u012br, when his am\u012brs represented: \u2018You are a great king! Return by the way you came, lest Shir Kh\u0101n should say: \u201cForsaking his road of advance, he took another of retreat.\u201d\u2019\\(^3\\) The Emperor returned to Mung\u012br, and brought many of his people and his family by boat up the river as far as Hajipur-Patna.\n\nWhen he went (to Bengal) he had left Q\u0101sim (\u1e24usain Sult\u0101n Uzbeg) there. Now came news of Shir Kh\u0101n\u2019s approach. Whenever there was fighting, the royal troops won.\n\nJust now B\u0101b\u0101 Beg (Jal\u0101\u012br) came from Jaunp\u016br and Mirak Beg from Chan\u0101da (Chun\u0101r), and Mughal Beg from Oude.\\(^3a\\) As these three am\u012brs joined the Emperor, corn became dear.\n\nThen,\u2014such was God\u2019s will,\u2014they had halted without precaution, when Shir Kh\u0101n came and fell upon them. The army was defeated, and many kinsmen and followers remained in captivity. His Majesty\u2019s own blessed hand was wounded. Three days he remained in Chun\u0101r, and then came to Ara\u012bl.\\(^4\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The rebels mentioned on p. 236.\n\n\\(^2\\) For the probable facts, cf. B. & H., II. 162 et seq.\n\n\\(^3\\) It was Mu\u2019yid Beg Duladai Barlas who urged this foolish point of honour, and who thus led to the disaster at Chausa. He was a cruel man as well as one ignorant in military matters. He was a favourite of Hum\u0101y\u016bn, but the Emperor\u2019s followers rejoiced when he died.\n\n\\(^4\\) Gul-badan\u2019s brevity (natural enough even if she were more historic in method) is somewhat misleading. Mr. Erskine allows one to follow\nWhen his Majesty reached the river's bank, he stopped, bewildered as to the crossing, and said: 'How to cross without boats!' Then came the r\u0101ja (B\u012brbah\u0101n) with five or six horsemen and led him through a ford. For four or five days his people were without food or drink. At last the r\u0101ja started a b\u0101z\u0101r, so that the people of the army lived some days in comfort and repose. The horses also were rested. Many men who were on foot bought fresh mounts. In short, the r\u0101ja rendered fitting and dutiful services. Later on his Majesty gave him leave to go, and at the hour of mid-day prayer came himself, safely and comfortably, to the bank of the Jamna. The army crossed at a ford they had found. A few days later they came to Karra, where corn and grass were plentiful, because it was his Majesty's own country. (33b)\n\nWhen his people were rested, he went on to Kalp\u012b, and then marched on to \u0100gra.\n\nBefore his arrival in \u0100gra, he heard news that Shir Kh\u0101n was coming (from) the direction of Chausa. Great anxiety fell upon his people.\n\nOf many who were in that rout (at Chausa) there was never heard, in any way soever, news or sign. Amongst them were \u0100yisha Sult\u0101n Begam, daughter of Sult\u0101n Husain Mirz\u0101\u00b9 (B\u0101yqra); and Bachaka, who was a khal\u012bfa of my royal father;\u00b2 and Bega-j\u0101n k\u016bka; and \u0100qiqa Begam;\u00b3 and Ch\u0101nd Bibi, who was seven months with\n\n\u00b9 Wife of Q\u0101sim Husain Sult\u0101n Uzbeg, whose timely arrival gave B\u0101bar so much satisfaction. (13a) Q\u0101sin had been Governor of Patna. (32b), but, from the circumstance of his wife's being at Chausa, would seem to have left it with Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\n\n\u00b2 A Bachaka, who was a khal\u012bfa of B\u0101bar's household, escaped with him from Samarqand in 1501 (907H.), some thirty-eight years before the Chausa episode. Khal\u012bfa, as applied to a woman, denotes a servant or slave who exercises surveillance over other women-servants, and has charge of rooms,\u2014an upper maid-servant.\n\n\u00b3 Bega Begam's daughter, who will have been about eight years old.\nchild, and Sh\u0101d Bibi, all three\\(^1\\) (sic) of whom were of his Majesty's \u1e25aram. Of these several people, he never heard even a word, as to whether they were drowned or what became of them. In spite of all possible inquiry and search, what had become of them was never found out.\n\nHis own illness\\(^2\\) dragged on for forty days, and he then grew better.\n\nAt this time, when Khusrau Beg (k\u016bkult\u0101sh), and Diw\u0101na Beg, and Zah\u012bd Beg, and Sayyid Am\u012br, had come on in advance of his Majesty, news again arrived that the m\u012brz\u0101s, Muhammad Sult\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 and his sons, had come to Kanauj.\\(^3\\)\n\nAfter Shaikh Bahl\u016bl's murder, M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l went to Dihl\u012b. He took with him M\u012br Faqr-\u02bfal\u012b and other well-wishers to frustrate and disperse the m\u012brz\u0101s. The m\u012brz\u0101s fled, and came into the Kanauj quarter. M\u012br Faqr-\u02bfal\u012b brought M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u0101dg\u0101r-n\u0101\u1e63ir to Dihl\u012b. As there was neither friendliness nor confidence between M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l and M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u0101dg\u0101r-n\u0101\u1e63ir, M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l, when M\u012br Faqr-\u02bfal\u012b made this mistake, sat down out of sheer annoyance and besieged Dihl\u012b.\\(^4\\)\n\nWhen M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n heard these things, there arose in him also a desire of sovereignty. With 12,000 fully equipped horsemen he went to Dihl\u012b. M\u012br Faqr-\u02bfal\u012b and M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u0101dg\u0101r-n\u0101\u1e63ir closed the city gates on his approach. Two or three days later, M\u012br Faqr-\u02bfal\u012b, having made an agreement, went and saw M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n. He represented: 'The news heard of his Majesty and Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n may be so and so.' M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u0101dg\u0101r-n\u0101\u1e63ir, from thought of his own interest, does not wait on you. The advisable course at this crisis is, that you should lay hands on M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Perhaps the copyist has omitted a name; perhaps, as a child of Hum\u0101y\u016bn, 'Aq\u012bqa is 'of the \u1e25aram.'\n\n\\(^2\\) From his wound or from distress of mind. The 'forty days' suggest the ceremonial term of mourning.\n\n\\(^3\\) The whole of the above paragraph it would be safest to hide with Hind\u0101l under his sister's charitable cloak.

(34b)\n\nM\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n gave heed to M\u012br Faqr-\u2018al\u012b\u2019s words, and bestowed on him a head-to-foot dress. He then seized M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l and came to \u0100gra. He visited the tomb of Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u012b,\u00b9 saw his mother and sisters, and halted in the Rose-scattering\u00b2 Garden.\n\nAt this time N\u016br Beg brought word of his Majesty\u2019s coming.\u00b3 As M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l was excluded from the presence because of the murder of Shaikh Bahl\u016bl, he went to Alwar.\u2074\n\nA few days after his Majesty\u2019s arrival, M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n came from the Rose-scattering Garden and paid his respects to him. We paid our respects on the evening of the day he came. He took notice of this insignificant one, and was kindly pleased to say: \u2018I did not know you at first, because when I led the army (whose footprints are victorious\u2075) to Gaur Bang\u0101la, you wore the high cap (\u1e6d\u0101q), and now when I saw the muslin coif\u2076 I did not recognise you. And oh, my Gul-badan, I used very often to think of you, and was sometimes sorry, and said: \u201cI do wish I had brought her!\u201d But at the time of the disaster (fi\u1e6dr\u0101t) I was thankful I had not, and I said: (35a) \u201cThank God I did not bring Gul-badan!\u201d For although \u2018Aqiqa\u2077 was young, I have been\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 B\u0101bar\u2019s remains then had not been conveyed to K\u0101bul in 1589.\n\u00b2 (?)

This, after Chausa, can only be a precative of Gul-badan\u2019s.\n\u2076 This change appears to indicate that Gul-badan, who is about eighteen or nineteen years old, has been married. The Persian has lachag gas\u0101ba, without conjunction. Steingass and Johnson describe the lachag as a square mantle worn by women, doubled into a triangle, but here the description given in the Burh\u0101n-i-q\u0101t\u012b\u2019i is more apropos, i.e., a square of stuff folded cornerwise and put upon the head so that the corners tie under the chin. It is often (l.c.) elaborately embroidered in gold. Qas\u0101ba appears to have the same meaning as lachag.\n\u2077 Cf. p. 33b.\nconsumed by a hundred thousand regrets and cares, and have said: \"Why did I take her with the army?\"\n\nA few days later he came to see my mother. He had with him the Holy Book. He commanded the attendants to retire\\(^1\\) for awhile, and they rose and there was privacy. Then he said to \u0101jam (Dil-d\u0101r Begam) and this insignificant one, and to Afgh\u0101n\u012b \u0101gh\u0101cha, and Gul-n\u0101r \u0101gh\u0101cha, and N\u0101r-gul \u0101gh\u0101cha, and my nurse (anaga): 'Hind\u0101l is my strength\\(^2\\) and my spear;\\(^3\\) the desirable light of my eyes, the might of my arm, the desired, the beloved. May what I do be right! What shall I say to M\u012brz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Hind\u0101l about the affair of my\\(^4\\) Shaikh Bahl\u016bl? What was to be has been! Now there is no anger in my heart against Hind\u0101l. If you do not believe it'... He had lifted up the Holy Book when her Highness my mother, Dil-d\u0101r Begam, and this poor thing snatched it from his hand. All cried, 'May what you do be right! Why do you say such things?'\n\nThen again he spoke: 'How would it be, Gul-badan, if you went yourself and fetched your brother, Mu\u1e25ammad Hind\u0101l M\u012brz\u0101?' (35b) Her Highness, my mother, said: 'This girlie (dukhtarak) is young. She has never made a journey (alone). If you approved, I would go.' His Majesty said: 'If I give you this trouble, it is because it is clearly incumbent on fathers and mothers to feel for their children. If you would honour him with a visit, it would be a healing-balm applied for us all.'\n\nThen he sent Mir Ab\u016b'l-baq\u0101\\(^5\\) with her Highness my mother, to fetch M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l. At once on hearing this\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) kin\u0101ra kardand.

It might be, however (as at 'Now there is no anger,' cf. text), the simple first person.\n\n\\(^5\\) B. & H., II., s.n..\nnews: 'She has come to see me!' Mu\u1e25ammad Hind\u0101l M\u012brz\u0101 made his mother happy by giving her honourable meeting. He came with her from Alwar, and paid his duty to his Majesty.\u00b9 About Shaikh Bahl\u016bl he said: 'He used to send arms and military appurtenances to Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n. When this was ascertained, I killed the shaikh on account of it.'\n\nTo put it briefly: in a short time came news that Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n had come near Lakhnau.\n\nIn those days his Majesty had a certain servant, a water-carrier. (36a) As he had been parted from his horse in the river at Chausa and this servant betook himself to his help and got him safe and sound out of the current, his Majesty now seated him on the throne. The name of that menial person we did not hear, some said Ni\u1e93\u0101m, some said Sambal. But to cut the story short, his Majesty made the water-carrier servant sit on the throne, and ordered all the am\u012brs to make obeisance to him. The servant gave everyone what he wished, and made appointments. For as much as two days the Emperor gave royal power to that menial. M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l was not present at his court;\u00b2 he had taken leave, and had again gone to Alwar with the intention of getting arms ready. Neither did M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n appear. He was ill, and sent to say to his Majesty: 'Gifts and favours of some other kind ought to be the servant's reward. What propriety is there in setting him on the throne? At a time when Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n is near, what kind of affair is this to engage your Majesty?'\n\nIn those days M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n's illness increased amazingly. He became weak and so thin that his face was not in the least his own, and there was no hope of his life. (36b)\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Hind\u0101l was received in the presence of K\u0101mr\u0101n and other kinsmen. Hum\u0101y\u016bn said to K\u0101mr\u0101n: 'You know who is to blame! Why did Hind\u0101l rebel?' K\u0101mr\u0101n passed on the question to Hind\u0101l himself, who, with profound shame, pleaded that being young he had listened to bad advice, and begged forgiveness. (Erskine's notes on Stewart's Jauhar, B. M. Add. 26,608.)\n\n\u00b2 Lit., in that assembly.\nBy the Divine mercy he grew better. He suspected that the Emperor\u2019s mothers,\\(^1\\) by his Majesty\u2019s advice, had given him poison. His Majesty came to hear of this, and instantly went to see the m\u012brz\u0101 and swore that he had never had such a thought, nor given such an order to any one. Nevertheless, Mirz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s heart was not purged. Afterwards he got worse, day after day, and he lost power of speech.\n\nWhen news came that Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n had left Lakhnau, the Emperor marched towards Kanauj, and left M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n in \u0100gra to act for him. In a few days the m\u012brz\u0101 heard that he had made a bridge of boats and crossed the Ganges. On this, he himself marched out of \u0100gra towards L\u0101h\u014dr.\\(^2\\)\n\nWe had settled down\\(^3\\) when he sent\\(^4\\) a farm\u0101n like a king\u2019s, and said: \u2018You\\(^5\\) are commanded to go with me to L\u0101h\u014dr.\u2019 He must have said\\(^6\\) to his Majesty about me something of this sort: \u2018I am very ill and very miserable and lonely, and I have no one\\(^7\\) to sympathize with me. (37a) If you will order Gul-badan Begam to go with me to L\u0101h\u014dr, it will be a real favour and kindness.\u2019 For his sake his Majesty will have said: \u2018She shall go.\u2019 Two or three days after the Emperor had gone towards Lakhnau, the m\u012brz\u0101 sent a farm\u0101n,\\(^8\\) in royal style, to the effect: \u2018Most assuredly you will come with me.\u2019 Then my mother must have said: \u2018She has never travelled apart from us.\u2019 He replied:\\(^9\\) \u2018If she has not travelled alone, do you also go with her.\u2019 He sent as many as 500 troopers and trusty grooms, and both his foster-father and his foster-brother, and said (to my mother): \u2018If she may not go with me (to\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) i.e., B\u0101bar\u2019s widows.\n\n\\(^2\\) A treacherous defection.\n\n\\(^3\\) The royal family, after the Emperor\u2019s and the m\u012brz\u0101\u2019s departure.\n\n\\(^4\\) Perhaps from his first halting-place outside the city.\n\n\\(^5\\) Clearly Gul-badan.\n\n\\(^6\\) Before either brother left \u0100gra.\n\n\\(^7\\) i.e., of his kinsfolk, and especially of his women kinsfolk.\n\n\\(^8\\) This, I think, is the one already named.\n\n\\(^9\\) \u012bsh\u0101n farmudand. This seems to mean Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and to refer the following speech back to the earliest discussion of the project of Gul-badan\u2019s journey at the time Hum\u0101y\u016bn was still in \u0100gra. The whole episode is confused in narrative.\nL\u0101h\u014dr), come all of you one stage.' When one stage was reached, he began to declare, on his oath: 'I will not let you go.' Then he took me by main force, with a hundred weepings and complaints and laments, away from my mothers, and my own mother and my sisters, and my father's people, and my brothers, and parted us who had all grown up together from infancy.\\(^1\\)\n\nI saw that the Emperor's command also was in the affair. I was helpless. (37b) I wrote a suppliant letter, saying: 'I never expected your Majesty to cut off this insignificant one from your service, and to give her to M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n.' To this humble note he sent a compassionate answer (sal\u0101m-n\u0101ma), to this effect: 'I had no heart to part with you, but the m\u012brz\u0101 persisted, and was miserable, and begged very hard, and I was obliged to trust you to him. For just now there is important work\\(^2\\) on hand. God willing, I will send for you when it is settled.'\n\nWhen the m\u012brz\u0101 was starting, many people, am\u012brs and traders and so on, made preparation with the intention of letting their wives and families march under his escort to L\u0101h\u014dr. When we reached (the city) news came of a battle on the Ganges, and that defeat had befallen the royal army.\\(^3\\)\n\nAt least there was this limit to misfortune,\u2014his Majesty and his brothers came safely through the peril.\\(^4\\) Our other relations\\(^5\\) came from \u0100gra by way of Alwar to L\u0101h\u014dr. (38a)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) It must be remembered that Gul-badan's husband, Khizr Khw\u0101ja, was a brother of \u0100q Sultan (Yas\u012bn-daulat), K\u0101mr\u0101n's son-in-law, and K\u0101mr\u0101n may have had other motives than affection for desiring her presence, e.g., the attraction of her husband's contingent.\n\n\\(^2\\) The opposition of Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n, soon to be closed at Kanauj. Gul-badan's enforced departure with K\u0101mr\u0101n saved her a painful and hazardous flight.\n\n\\(^3\\) May 17th, 1540 (Muharram 10th, 947H.). M\u012brz\u0101 Haidar gives an admirable account of it as 'the battle of the Ganges.' Gul-badan's full brother, Hind\u0101l, led the van at Kanauj, and defeated Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n's son, Jal\u0101l. Hind\u0101l was a successful general. 'Askar\u012b, K\u0101mr\u0101n's full brother, was defeated by Khaw\u0101s Kh\u0101n.\n\n\\(^4\\) As at Chausa, so at Kanauj, Hum\u0101y\u016bn was nearly drowned. Here he was saved by Shamsu-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad of Ghazn\u012b, whose wife, under the sobriquet of J\u012b-j\u012b anaga, became a nurse of Akbar.\n\n\\(^5\\) They were convoyed by Hind\u0101l. See infra.\nJust now the Emperor said to M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l: \u2018Aq\u012bqa Begam disappeared in that first interregnum (fitrat\\(^1\\)), and I repented extremely, and said: \u201cWhy did I not kill her in my own presence?\u201d Now, again, it is difficult to convey women with us.\u2019 M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l answered: \u2018What it would be to your Majesty to kill a mother and a sister, speaks for itself! So long as there is life in me, I will fight in their service. I have hope in the most high God, that,\u2014poor fellow as I am,\u2014I may pour out my life\u2019s blood for my mother and my sisters.\u2019\n\nThen the Emperor set out for Fathip\u016br (Sikr\u012b) with M\u012brz\u0101 \u2019Askar\u012b and Y\u0101dg\u0101r-n\u0101\u0161ir M\u012brz\u0101 and the am\u012brs who had come safely off the battlefield.\\(^2\\)\n\nM\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l sent on before him\\(^3\\) her Highness his mother, who was Dil-d\u0101r Begam, and his own sister, Gul-chihra Begam, and Afgh\u0101n\u012b \u0101gh\u0101cha, and Gul-n\u0101r \u0101gh\u0101cha, and N\u0101r-gul \u0101gh\u0101cha, and the am\u012brs\u2019 wives and families, etc.. He was marching along when the G\u0101w\u0101rs pursued him in great numbers.\\(^3sb\\) Some of his troopers charged and defeated them. An arrow struck his horse.\\(^4\\) There was much fighting and confusion. Having saved the helpless women from the bond of the G\u0101w\u0101rs, he sent on (to L\u0101h\u014dr) his mother and sister, and many of the am\u012brs\u2019 people, etc., and went to Alwar. Here he got together tents and pavilions and numerous requisites, and then started for L\u0101h\u014dr. He arrived in a few days,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) i.e., battle of Chausa. Fitna would read more easily here. Perhaps behind fitrat is the notion of relaxation in effort, or of an interval between two periods of good fortune.\n\n\\(^2\\) Amongst them was Haidar M\u012brz\u0101, who describes the fugitives as \u2018broken and dispirited, and in a state heartrending to tell.\u2019 Sikr\u012b must have rubbed salt into their wounds, since it recalls B\u0101bar\u2019s triumph. Their halting-place there was his garden, a token of his genius for living.\n\n\\(^3\\) The known enemy, Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n, was in the rear. With Hind\u0101l\u2019s marriage-feast fresh in mind, one may give a thought to Sul\u1e6d\u0101nam. She was probably of this party, since her husband\u2019s contingent was with Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and he was not on his j\u0101g\u012br of Alwar.\n\n\\(^4\\) Asp-i-mub\u0101r\u012bk, (?) the horse which had the happiness to bear him. Perhaps asp is a mistake for some word to which \u2018blessed\u2019 would be a more fit adjective.\nand brought what was wanted for the princes and the am\u012brs.\n\nHis Majesty alighted in Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101zi\u2019s garden near Bibi Haj-taj.\\(^1\\) Every day there was news of Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n; and during the three months that the Emperor was in L\u0101h\u014dr word was brought day after day: \u2018Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n has advanced four miles,\u2019 \u2018six miles,\u2019 till he was near Sirhind.\n\nOne of the am\u012brs was named Mu\u1e93affar Beg. He was a T\u016brkman. The Emperor sent him with Q\u0101z\u012b \u02bfAbdu-l-l\u0101h to Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n to say: \u2018What justice is there in this? I have left you the whole of Hindust\u0101n. Leave L\u0101h\u014dr alone, and let Sirhind, where you are, be a boundary between you and me.\u2019 (39a) But that unjust man, fearless of God, did not consent, and answered: \u2018I have left you K\u0101bul. You should go there.\u2019\n\nMu\u1e93affar Beg marched at once, and sent on an express to say: \u2018A move must be made.\u2019 As soon as this message came, his Majesty set off. It was like the Day of Resurrection. People left their decorated places and furniture just as they were, but took with them whatever money they had. There was thankfulness to God, because mercifully a ford was found across the L\u0101h\u014dr water (R\u0101v\u012b) where everyone crossed. His Majesty halted a few days on the river\u2019s bank. Then an ambassador came from Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n. The Emperor had decided to see him next morning, when M\u012brz\u0101 Kamr\u0101n made a petition, saying: \u2018To-morrow there\n\n\\(^1\\) Ab\u016b\u2019l-fa\u017cl says that Hind\u0101l\u2019s quarters were in Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101zi\u2019s garden, and Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s in Khw\u0101ja Dost munshi\u2019s. Bibi Haj, Bibi Taj, Bibi Nur, Bibi H\u016br, Bibi G\u016bhar, and Bibi Sh\u0101baz are said to have been daughters of \u02bfAq\u012bl, brother of \u02bfAl\u012b (Mu\u1e25ammad\u2019s son-in-law). They were famous for piety and asceticism. After the murder of Im\u0101m \u1e24usain at Kerbela, these ladies left Syria for India in obedience to a secret intimation. They alighted outside L\u0101h\u014dr at the place named by Gul-badan and where their shrine now is. They converted many of the townspeople to their faith, and thus angered the, presumably. Hind\u016b, governor. He sent his son to command their departure, but the son fell under their influence, and remained near them. This still more angered his father, who went out against them and their followers with an armed force. The ladies prayed that their honour might be preserved, and they not be seen by strange men. Immediately the earth opened and swallowed them. (Khaz\u012bna\u2019u-l-a\u1e63fiy\u0101, II. 407.)\nwill be an entertainment, and Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n\u2019s envoy will be present. If I may sit on a corner of your Majesty\u2019s carpet, so that there may be distinction between me and my brothers, it will be a cause of my exaltation.\\(^1\\)\n\nHam\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b Begam says it was his Majesty who wrote and sent the following verse to the m\u012brz\u0101.\\(^2\\) I had heard that he sent it to Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n by the envoy. This is the verse:\n\n\u2018Although one\u2019s image be shown in the mirror,\nIt remains always apart from one\u2019s self.\u2019\\(^3\\) (39b)\n\u2018It is wonderful to see one\u2019s self in another form:\nThis marvel will be the work of God.\u2019\n\nWhen Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n\u2019s ambassador arrived, he paid his respects.\n\nThe Emperor\u2019s blessed heart was cast down. He fell asleep in a sad mood, and saw in a dream a venerable man, dressed in green from head to foot and carrying a staff, who said: \u2018Be of good cheer; do not grieve;\u2019 and gave his staff into the royal hand. \u2018The most high God will give you a son who shall be named Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Akbar.\u2019 The Emperor asked: \u2018What is your honourable name?\u2019 He answered: \u2018The Terrible Elephant,\\(^4\\) A\u1e25mad of J\u0101m;\u2019 and added: \u2018Your son will be of my lineage.\\(^5\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) For an account of K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s odious and fruitless treachery see B. & H., II. 200 et seq.. The meaning of his message to Hum\u0101y\u016bn is not clear to me. Perhaps he wished to show the envoy that he was not on the level of Hind\u0101l and \u1e24askar\u012b, but able to claim recognition as a ruler and as Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s equal. Perhaps it was a hint to Hum\u0101y\u016bn that he must recognise K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s equality in the lands in which the latter had been supreme while he himself ruled in Dihl\u012b.\n\nAt this time Hum\u0101y\u016bn was strongly advised to put K\u0101mr\u0101n to death. He refused, but later on and after a dreary waste of good nature, his filial piety had to yield to the common-sense of his victimized followers and allow the blinding.\n\n\\(^2\\) At the time when the verse was written Ham\u012bda was not married. The discussion in 1587 (circa) of a \u2018point\u2019 between the ladies is a living touch to the old MS.. Which was likely to be right,\u2014Ham\u012bda, who might later have heard the story from her husband, or Gul-badan who was in L\u0101h\u014dr? Gul-badan puts the difference of opinion gently but does not surrender, and leaves her readers to draw their own inferences.\n\n\\(^3\\) Zinda-fil.\n\n\\(^4\\) Hum\u0101y\u016bn was of the lineage of Ahmad of J\u0101m through his mother M\u0101ham. (A. N., Bib. Ind., ed.I. 121.) To give force to the prophecy,\nIn those days Bib\u012b G\u00fcnwar\\(^1\\) was with child. Everyone said: \u2018A son will be born.\u2019 In that same garden of Dost munsh\u012b and in the month of Jum\u0101da\u2019u-l-awwal, a daughter was born whom they named Bakhsh\u012b-b\u0101n\u016b.\n\nAt this time his Majesty appointed M\u012brz\u0101 \u1e24aidar to take Kashmir. Meantime, news was brought that Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n was there. A wonderful confusion followed, and the Emperor decided to march off next morning. (40a)\n\nWhile the brothers were in L\u0101h\u014dr, they conferred and took counsel and asked advice, but they did not settle on any single thing. At last the news was: \u2018Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n is here.\u2019 Then, as there was no help for it, they marched off at the first watch of the day (9 a.m.).\n\nThe Emperor\u2019s wish was to go to Kashmir, where he had sent M\u012brz\u0101 \u1e24aidar K\u0101shghar\u012b; but news of the m\u012brz\u0101\u2019s success had not yet come, and people counselled: \u2018If your Majesty were to go to Kashmir, and the country was not conquered at once, it would\u2014with Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n in L\u0101h\u014dr\u2014be a very difficult time.\u2019\n\nKhw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n Beg\\(^2\\) was in Si\u0101lk\u014dt, and disposed to serve His Majesty. With him was M\u016b\u2019yid Beg, who wrote: \u2018The khw\u0101ja greatly wishes to serve you and would come, but he has M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n to consider. If your Majesty would come quickly, his help would be made easy in an excellent way.\u2019 The Emperor at once took arms and equipment, and set out to go to the khw\u0101ja, and joined company with him and brought him along.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) To give value to Al\u012bmad\u2019s prophecy, Bib\u012b G\u00fcnwar ought also to have traced back to him. She does not seem to have been a woman of rank. The girl now born was at least the third child of Hum\u0101y\u016bn, there having been Al-am\u0101n and \u2018Aq\u012bqa, children of Bega Begam and now both dead.\n\n\\(^2\\) The well-known old servant of B\u0101bar and now one of K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s chief amirs.\n\n\\(^3\\) The begam\u2019s story here does not agree with that of Mr. Erskine\u2019s authorities. M\u016b\u2019yid Beg is the ill-adviser of the march from Bengal to Chausa.\nThe Emperor was pleased to say: 'With my brothers' concurrence, I shall go to Badakhsh\u0101n.' (40b) Let K\u0101bul remain the fief of M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n.' But M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n would not consent to (his Majesty's) going to K\u0101bul,\u00b9 and said: 'In his lifetime the Emperor Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u012b gave K\u0101bul to my mother (Gulrukh Begam). It is not right (for you) to go to K\u0101bul.'\n\nThen said his Majesty: 'As for K\u0101bul, his Majesty Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u012b often used to say, \"My K\u0101bul I will give to no one; far from it! Let none of my sons covet it. There God gave me all my children, and many victories followed its capture.\" Moreover, this expression of opinion is recorded many times in his Waq\u012b\u02bfa-n\u0101ma. What was the good of my showing kindness to the m\u012brz\u0101 from civility and brotherliness, if he now keep on talking in this way!'\n\nLet his Majesty talk as he would, pacifying and conciliating, the m\u012brz\u0101 resisted more and more. When he saw that there was a large following with M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n, and that the m\u012brz\u0101 was in no way willing for him to go to K\u0101bul, he had no resource but to move towards Bhakkar and Mult\u0101n. Having arrived in Mult\u0101n, he halted one day. (41a) A small quantity of corn was obtained in the fort and having divided that little amongst his men, he marched on till he came to the bank of a river which was seven rivers in one.\u00b2 He stood distracted. There were no boats, and he had a large camp with him. Then there came word that Khaw\u0101\u1e63 Kh\u0101n,\u00b3 with several am\u012brs, was coming up behind.\n\nThere was a Bal\u016bch\u012b named Bakhsh\u016b (sic) who had forts\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 K\u0101mr\u0101n may well have feared that Hum\u0101y\u016bn would get no further than K\u0101bul on his way to Badakhsh\u0101n.\n\u00b2 i.e., the Indus. The begam's 'seven' is interesting. Cf. 'Sketch of the Hindust\u0101n\u012b Language,' C. J. Lyall, p.1 n.. 'Hindo represents an earlier Hindau, being the modern Persian for the ancient Hendava, i.e., a dweller in the country of the sapta hind\u016b (Sk. sapta sindhu), or \"seven rivers,\" now called, with the omission of two (probably the Saraswati and Drishadwati or Ghaggar) the Panj-\u0101b.'\n\u00b3 A follower of Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n.\nand many men. His Majesty sent him a banner and kettledrums, and a horse, and a head-to-foot suit, and asked for boats and also for corn. After a time Bakhsh\u016b Bal\u016bch\u012b got together and sent about a hundred boats, full of corn too, for the royal service,\u2014a proper attention which pleased the Emperor very much. He divided the corn amongst his people, and crossed the water\u00b9 safe and sound. May mercy be shown to Bakhsh\u016b for his dutiful service!\n\nAfter a weary journey, they reached Bhakkar at last. The fort is in the middle of the river and very strong. The governor, Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Ma\u1e25m\u016bd (Bhakkar\u012b),\u00b2 had fortified himself in it. (41b) The Emperor alighted safe and well over against the fort, near which was a garden\u00b3 made by M\u012brz\u0101 Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain Samandar.\u2074\n\nAt length his Majesty sent M\u012br Samandar to Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain M\u012brz\u0101 with this message: \u2018We have come into your territory under compulsion. May your country be blessed to you! We shall not take possession of it. Would to Heaven you would yourself come and pay us your respects, and do us the service which is our due! We intend to go to Gujr\u0101t, and should leave you your own country.\u2019 By tricks and wiles, Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain kept his Majesty as much as five months in Samandar; then he sent a person to wait on him, and to say: \u2018I am arranging my daughter\u2019s wedding-feast, and I send (someone) to wait on you. I shall come (later).\u2019 His Majesty believed him, and waited still three months. Sometimes there was corn to be had, sometimes not. The soldiers killed and ate their horses and camels. Then his Majesty sent again, by\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 The G\u0101ra, near Uch.\n\u00b2 Foster-brother of Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain Argh\u016bn, and the man for whom S\u012bd\u012b 'Al\u012b Reis negotiated terms with Hum\u0101y\u016bn in 1555.\n\u00b3 A delightful garden, the Ch\u0101r-bagh of Ruhri (L\u016bhr\u012b), on the left bank of the Indus. Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain felt no anxiety as to military operations after hearing that Hum\u0101y\u016bn had camped here. Ch\u0101r-b\u0101gh seems to denote a royal and private garden.\n\u2074 \u2018A place in Hind\u016bst\u0101n from which aloes are brought.\u2019 (Steingass, s.v..) Cf. Samand\u016br\u012b, aloe-wood, of the \u0100\u012bn. (Blochmann 80.) Samandar seems an equivalent for Sind.\nShaikh 'Abdu-l-ghaf\u016br,\u00b9 to ask: \u2018How much longer will you be? What prevents you from coming? (42a) Things have come to such a pass that there is inconvenience, and many of my men are deserting.\u2019 The reply was: \u2018My daughter\u00b2 is promised to Mirz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n, and a meeting with me is impossible. I could not wait on you.\u2019\n\nAs at this time Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Hind\u0101l crossed the river, some said he might be going to Qandah\u0101r.\u00b3 On hearing this his Majesty sent several people after him to make inquiry and to say: \u2018It is reported that you plan going to Qandah\u0101r.\u2019 When questioned, the m\u012brz\u0101 said: \u2018People have given a wrong impression.\u2019 On this the Emperor came\u2074 to see her Highness my mother.\n\nThe m\u012brz\u0101\u2019s \u1e25aram and all his people paid their respects to his Majesty at this meeting. Concerning Ham\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b Begam, his Majesty asked: \u2018Who is this?\u2019 They said: \u2018The daughter of M\u012br B\u0101b\u0101 Dost.\u2019 Khw\u0101ja Mu\u02bfazzam\u2075 was standing opposite his Majesty, who said: \u2018This boy will be one of my kinsmen (too?).\u2019\u2076 Of Ham\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b he said: \u2018She, too, is related to me.\u2019 (42b)\n\nIn those days Ham\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b Begam was often in the m\u012brz\u0101\u2019s residence (ma\u1e25all). Another day when his Majesty came to see her Highness my mother, he remarked: \u2018M\u012br\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s treasurer (m\u012br-i-m\u0101l) whose official functions must now have been of the least pressing.\n\n\u00b2 The admirable Mah-ch\u016bchak who insisted upon accompanying the blinded K\u0101mr\u0101n to Makka. As her peer in compassion may be commemorated Chilma Beg k\u016bka. (B. & H., II., 418.)\n\n\u00b3 He encamped at P\u0101t (text, Pat), about twenty miles west of the Indus and about forty miles north of Sehw\u0101n. P\u0101t is in the sark\u0101r of Siwist\u0101n, a little to the east of the highroad to Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, and not far north of Me\u0101n\u012b, the scene of Napier\u2019s victory of 1843. I am indebted to Major-General Malcolm R. Haig for the information that P\u0101t is \u2018now a ruin, having been destroyed in the latter part of the eighteenth century when two Kalhora chiefs of Sind called in the Afgh\u0101ns to quell domestic troubles.\u2019\n\n\u2074 Leaving his troops to prosecute the siege of Bhakkar, and passing through D\u0101rbila where was his cousin, Y\u0101dg\u0101r-n\u0101\u1e63ir. From the wording it might be supposed that Gul-badan was with her mother in P\u0101t, but I believe she was in K\u0101bul at this time.\n\n\u2075 Cf. Appendix, s.n. Ham\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b.\n\n\u2076 (?) interrogative, but the preceding verb is guftand, and not pursi-dand.\nB\u0101b\u0101 Dost is related to us. It is fitting that you should give me his daughter in marriage.' M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l kept on making objections, and said: 'I look on this girl as a sister and child of my own. Your Majesty is a king. Heaven forbid there should not be a proper alimony, and that so a cause of annoyance should arise.'\n\nHis Majesty got angry, and rose and went away. Then my mother wrote and sent a letter, saying: 'The girl's mother has even before this been using persuasion.' It is astonishing that you should go away in anger over a few words.' He wrote in reply: 'Your story is very welcome to me. Whatever persuasion you may use, by my head and eyes, I will agree to it. As for what they have written about alimony, please Heaven, what they ask will be done. My waiting eye is on the road.' My mother fetched his Majesty, and on that day she gave a party. When it was over, he went to his own quarters. (43a) On another day he came to my mother, and said: 'Send someone to call \u1e24am\u012bd\u0101-b\u0101n\u016b Begam here.' When she sent, the begam did not come, but said: 'If it is to pay my respects, I was exalted by paying my respects the other day. Why should I come again?' Another time his Majesty sent Subh\u0101n Quli, and said: 'Go to M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l, and tell him to send the begam.' The m\u012brz\u0101 said: 'Whatever I may say, she\n\n---\n\n1 This looks like a side-glance at the wasted fortunes of royalty. No kingdom! No revenues! Whence then the dowry? It is clear from the sequel that the important point was being pressed.\n\nJauhar says that \u1e24am\u012bda had been already asked in marriage, but not betrothed or perhaps promised. Her objections to marry Hum\u0101y\u016bn seem personal, and may indicate preference for another and dislike for him. She is said to have been fourteen years old and Hum\u0101y\u016bn was thirty-three, an opium-eater, and much married already. Her objections, whatever their true basis, must have been strong or they could hardly have survived, for Gul-badan to record, through the many years of prosperity and proud motherhood which her husband's renewed sovereignty in India and her son's distinction secured to her.\n\nBehind Gul-badan's story of the wooing of \u1e24am\u012bda there were doubtless many talks over 'old times' when the royal authoress was freshening her memory for her literary task, begun (it seems probable) when she was about sixty-five, and \u1e24am\u012bda some few years younger.\n\n2 M\u0101dar-i-dukhtar az \u012bn ham peshtar n\u0101z m\u012bkanad. Perhaps, 'caressed the idea.'\nwill not go. Go yourself and tell her.' When Subh\u0101n Qul\u012b went and spoke, the begam replied: 'To see kings once is lawful; a second time it is forbidden. I shall not come.' On this Subh\u0101n Qul\u012b went and represented what she had said. His Majesty remarked: 'If she is not a consort (n\u0101 mahram), we will make her a consort (mahram).'\n\nTo cut the story short: For forty days the begam resisted and discussed and disagreed. At last her highness my mother, Dil-d\u0101r Begam, advised her, saying: 'After all you will marry someone. Better than a king, who is there?' The begam said: 'Oh yes, I shall marry someone; but he shall be a man whose collar my hand can touch, and not one whose skirt it does not reach.' Then my mother again gave her much advice. (43b)\n\nAt last, after forty days (discussion), at mid-day on Monday (fault) Jum\u012bdu-l-awwal (sic) 948H. (September, 1541), and in P\u0101tr (sic), his Majesty took the astrolabe into his own blessed hand and, having chosen a propitious hour, summoned M\u012br Ab\u016b'l-baq\u0101 and ordered him to make fast the marriage bond. He gave the m\u012br two laks of ready money for the dower\\(^1\\) (nik\u0101l\u0101na), and having stayed three days after the wedding in P\u0101tr, he set out and went by boat to Bhakkar.\n\nHe spent a month at Bhakkar and he sent M\u012br Ab\u016b'l-baq\u0101 to Sult\u0101n Bhakkari. The m\u012br fell ill while away, and went to the mercy of God.\\(^2\\)\n\nHis Majesty then gave M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l leave to go to Qandah\u0101r, and he dismissed M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u0101dg\u0101r-n\u0101\u1e63ir to his own place, L\u0101r. He himself went towards Se\u0101w\u0101n\\(^3\\) (Sehw\u0101n),\n\n---\n\n1 Perhaps the ladies romance a little here. Hum\u0101y\u016bn was certainly at a loss for money now and later.\n\n2 This is not a historic account of the death. He was sent to Y\u0101dg\u0101r-n\u0101\u1e63ir and was shot while crossing the river on his return to R\u016bhr\u012b by adherents of Sh\u0101h Husain. His death caused great grief to Hum\u0101y\u016bn. (B. & H., II., 222.)\n\n3 At the end of September, 1541. Hind\u0101l's leave is a sisterly gloss on his acceptance of an invitation to Qandah\u0101r given by its governor, Qar\u0101cha Kh\u0101n.\nwhich is six or seven days' journey from Tatta.\\(^1\\) Sehw\u0101n has a strong fort, in which was M\u012br 'Al\u012bka, a servant of his Majesty the Emperor.\\(^2\\) There were several cannon, so no one could possibly go near. Some of the royal soldiers made trenches, and got near and gave him ('Al\u012bka) advice, and said: \\((44a)\\) 'Disloyalty is not well at such a time,' but M\u012br 'Al\u012bka did not agree with them. Then they made a mine and cast down a tower, but they could not take the fort. Corn became dear and many men deserted. The Emperor spent six or seven months there.\n\nM\u012brz\u0101 Sh\u0101h Husain treacherously laid hands on the royal soldiers in all directions, and made them over to his people, and said: 'Take them and throw them into the salt sea.' Three\\(^3\\) or four hundred would be gathered into one place and flung into boats and thrown into the sea, till as many as 10,000 were cast forth.\n\nAs after this there were few men even with the Emperor, (? Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain) filled several boats with cannon and muskets, and came from Tatta against him. Sehw\u0101n is near the river. (? M\u012br 'Al\u012bka) hindered the coming of the royal boats and provisions, and sent to say: '(?) I am maintaining my loyalty. March off quickly.' Having no remedy, the Emperor turned to Bhakkar.\n\nWhen he came near and before he could reach it, M\u012br (Sh\u0101h) \u1e24usain Samandar had sent word to M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u0101dg\u0101rn\u0101\u1e63\u012br: \\((44b)\\) 'If the Emperor, when he is retreating, should\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Semblance of relevance can be given to this statement only by reference to other writers. Hum\u0101y\u016bn had intended to go to Tatta at this time, and was diverted from the journey by a slight success of arms. He then besieged Sehw\u0101n.\n\n\\(^2\\) Certainly not so, for 'Al\u012bka was an Argh\u016bn and follower of Sh\u0101h Husain. Perhaps Gul-badan wrote or intended to convey that 'Al\u012bka had served B\u0101bar as once all the Argh\u016bns had done. Perhaps she has confused the import of the story that M\u012br 'Al\u012bka when sent by Sh\u0101h Husain to take command of Sehw\u0101n, actually passed through Hum\u0101y\u016bn's lines and the b\u0101z\u0101r without recognition as an enemy.\n\n\\(^3\\) Text, thirty\u2014s\u016bsad.

This presumably included K\u0101mr\u0101n's party, and was made up of soldiers and women, children, traders, servants, etc.. At this time Hum\u0101y\u016bn had lost both Hind\u0101l's and Y\u0101dg\u0101rn\u0101\u1e63\u012br's troops.\n\n\\(^4\\) The narrative becomes much confused here.\ncome near Bhakkar,\\(^1\\) do not let him in. Bhakkar may remain your holding. I am with you; I will give you my own daughter.' The m\u012brz\u0101 believed him and did not allow the Emperor to enter the fort, but wished to make him go on, either by force or fraud.\n\nHis Majesty sent a messenger to say: 'B\u0101b\u0101,\\(^2\\) you are as a son to me. I left you in my stead, so that you might help me in case of need. What you are doing is done by the evil counsel of your servants. Those faithless servants will be faithless to you also.' Whatever his Majesty urged had no effect.\\(^3\\) Then he said: 'Very well! I shall go to R\u0101ja M\u0101ldeo.\\(^4\\) I have bestowed this country on you, but Sh\u0101h Husain will not let you keep it. You will remember my words.' Having said this to the m\u012brz\u0101, the Emperor marched away by way of Jisalm\u012br, towards M\u0101ldeo. He reached Fort Dil\u0101war (Dir\u0101wal), on the r\u0101ja's frontier, a few days later.\\((45a)\\) He stayed there two days. Neither corn nor grass was to be had. He then went to Jisalm\u012br, and on his approach the r\u0101ja sent out troops to occupy the road, and there was fighting. The Emperor and some others went aside off the road. Several men were wounded: Al\u016bsh\\(^5\\) Beg, brother of Sh\u0101ham Jal\u0101ir and P\u012br Mu\u1e25ammad the equerry, and Raushang the wardrobe-keeper, and some others.\\(^6\\) At length the royal troops won and the infidels fled into the fort. That day the Emperor travelled 60 kos (cir. 120 miles), and then halted on the bank of a reservoir.\n\nNext he came into S\u012btalm\u012br, where he was harassed all day till he reached Pahl\u016bd\u012b, a pargana of M\u0101ldeo. The\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The m\u012brz\u0101 was at R\u016bhr\u012b and had not possession of the fort. Cf. B. & H., II., 226, for a good account of his treachery and credulity.\n\n\\(^2\\) (?)

App. s.n.\n\n\\(^6\\) Muq\u012bm Har\u0101w\u012b, father of Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn Ahmad, took part in this engagement.\nr\u0101ja was in Jodhp\u016br, and sent armour and a camel\u2019s-load of ashraf\u012bs, and greatly comforted his Majesty by saying: \u2018You are welcome! I give you Bikanir.\u2019 The Emperor halted with an easy mind, and despatched Atka Kh\u0101n (Shamsu-d-d\u012bn Ghaznav\u012b) to M\u0101ldeo, and said: \u2018What will his answer be?\u2019\n\nIn the downfall and desolation in Hind, Mull\u0101 Surkh, the librarian, had gone to M\u0101ldeo, and had entered his service. (45b) He now wrote: \u2018Beware, a thousand times beware of advancing. March at once from wherever you are, for M\u0101ldeo intends to make you prisoner. Put no trust in his words. There came here an envoy from Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n who brought a letter to say: \u201cBy whatever means you know and can use, capture that king. If you will do this, I will give you Nag\u014dr and Alwar and whatever place you ask for.\u201d\u2019 Atka Kh\u0101n also said when he came: \u2018This is no time for standing.\u2019 So at afternoon prayer-time the Emperor marched off. When he was mounting, they captured two spies and brought them bound before him. He was questioning them when suddenly they got their hands free, and one snatched a sword from the belt of Mu\u1e25ammad Gird-b\u0101z2 and struck him with it, and then wounded B\u0101q\u012b Gu\u0101li\u0101r\u012b. The other at once unsheathed3 a dagger and faced the bystanders, wounded several and killed the Emperor\u2019s riding-horse. They did much mischief before they were killed. (46a) Just then there was a cry, \u2018M\u0101ldeo is here!\u2019 The Emperor had no horse fit for \u1e24amida-b\u0101n\u016b Begam. He may have asked for one for her from Tard\u012b Beg,4 who apparently did not give it. He then said: \u2018Let the camel of Jauhar, the ewer-bearer, be got ready for me. I will ride it, and the begam may have\n\n---\n\n1 Presumably to Atka Kh\u0101n\u2019s message from Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\n2 (?) gird-b\u0101z\u016b, strong-limbed.\n3 Doubtful translation; az may\u012bn yak kash\u012bda.\n4 This excellent officer is frequently a scapegoat. Our begam, however, imputes her blame tentatively. For estimate of his character see B. & H., I. and II., s.n.. Jauhar brings Raushan Beg into a similar story of this terrible journey.\nmy horse.' It would seem that Nadim Beg heard that his Majesty was giving his horse to the begam and thinking of riding a camel, for he mounted his own mother on a camel and gave her horse to the Emperor.\n\nHis Majesty took a guide from this place, and mounted and rode for 'Umrk\u014dt. It was extremely hot; horses and (other) quadrupeds kept sinking to the knees in the sand, and M\u0101ldeo was behind. On they went, thirsty and hungry. Many, women and men, were on foot. (46b)\n\nOn the approach of M\u0101ldeo's troops, the Emperor said to Ish\u0101n(\u012as\u0101n)-tim\u016br Sult\u0101n and to Mu'nim Kh\u0101n and a number of others: 'You all come slowly, and watch the enemy till we have gone on a few miles.' They waited; it grew night, and they missed their way.\n\nAll through that night the Emperor went on, and at dawn a watering-place was found. For three days the horses had not drunk. He had dismounted when a man ran in, shouting: 'The Hind\u016bs are coming up in numbers, mounted on horses and camels.' Then the Emperor dismissed Shaikh 'Al\u012b Beg (Jal\u0101\u012br), and Raushan k\u016bka and Nad\u012bm k\u016bka, and M\u012br Payanda Mu\u1e25ammad, brother of Mu\u1e25ammad W\u0101l\u012b, and many others.\n\nThey recited the f\u0101tiha, and his Majesty said: 'Go, fight the infidels!' He thought: '\u012ash\u0101n-tim\u016br Sult\u0101n, and Mu'nim Kh\u0101n, and M\u012brza Y\u0101dg\u0101r, and the rest whom we left behind, have been killed or captured by these people who have now come to attack us.' He mounted and left the camp with a few followers.\n\nOf the band which his Majesty had sent out to fight after reciting the f\u0101tiha, Shaikh 'Al\u012b Beg struck the R\u0101jp\u016bt captain with an arrow, and cast him from his horse. (47a)\n\n---\n\n1 The husband of M\u0101ham anaga, Akbar's celebrated nurse. (R.A.S.J., January, 1899, art. M\u0101ham anaga, H. Beveridge.) His mother was Fakhru-n-nis\u0101'. Cf. Gul-badan, 26a and 71a.\n\n2 Perhaps ponies only. Text, ch\u0101rw\u0101.\n\n3 Gul-chihra's husband.\n\n4 The well-known Kh\u0101n-i-kh\u0101n\u0101n of Akbar's reign.\n\n5 Perhaps 'Uncle Y\u0101dg\u0101r' (tagh\u0101n\u012b), the father of Bega Begam. Y\u0101dg\u0101r-n\u0101\u0161ir was not here, but still in Sind.\nSeveral more (of the royal troop) hit others with arrows; the infidels turned to flee, and the fight was won. They brought in several prisoners alive. Then the camp went slowly, slowly on; but his Majesty was far ahead. Those who had recited the f\u0101ti\u1e25a came up with the camp.\n\nThere was a mace-bearer named Bihb\u016bd. They sent him galloping after the Emperor, to say: \u2018Let your Majesty go slowly. By Heaven\u2019s grace, a victory has been vouchsafed, and the infidels have fled.\u2019 Bihb\u016bd himself was taken to the presence, and conveyed the good news.\u00b9\n\nHis Majesty dismounted, and a little water even (ham)\u00b2 was found, but he was anxious about the am\u012brs, and said: \u2018What has happened to them?\u2019 Then horsemen appeared in the distance, and again there was a cry: \u2018God forbid! M\u0101ldeo!\u2019\u00b3 His Majesty sent a man for information, who came running back and said: \u2018\u012ash\u0101n-t\u012bm\u016br Sult\u0101n, and M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u0101dg\u0101r, and Mu\u2019n\u012bm Kh\u0101n are all coming, safe and sound.\u2019 They had missed their way. Their return rejoiced the Emperor, who rendered thanks to God.\n\nNext morning they marched on. For three days they found no water. (47b) On the fourth, they came to some very deep wells, the water of which was extraordinarily red. The Emperor halted and alighted near one of the wells; Tard\u012b Beg Kh\u0101n was at another; at a third, M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u0101dg\u0101r, and Mu\u2019n\u012bm Kh\u0101n, and Nad\u012bm k\u016bka; and at the fourth, \u012ash\u0101n-t\u012bm\u016br Sult\u0101n, and Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101z\u012b, and Raushan k\u016bka.\n\nAs each bucket came out of the wells into reach, people flung themselves on it; the ropes broke, and five or six persons fell into the wells with the buckets. Many perished from thirst. When the Emperor saw men flinging themselves into the wells from thirst, he let anyone drink from\n\n\u00b9 And also, tied to his girths, two heads of foes which he flung at Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s feet.\n\u00b2 to brim of the cup of joy.\n\u00b3 These cries remind one that even now Hum\u0101y\u016bn must have had with him a huge contingent of helpless beings, women and children and non-combatants.\nhis own water-bottle. When everyone had drunk his fill, they marched on again at afternoon prayer-time.\n\nAfter a day and a night they reached a large tank. The horses and camels went into the water and drank so much that many died. There had not been many horses, but there were mules and camels. (48a) Beyond this place water was found at every stage on the way to 'Umrk\u014dt, which is a beautiful place with many tanks.\n\nThe r\u0101n\u0101 gave the Emperor an honourable reception, and took him into the fort, and assigned him excellent quarters. He gave places outside to the amirs' people. Many things were very cheap indeed; four goats could be had for one r\u016bp\u012b. The r\u0101n\u0101 made many gifts of kids and so on, and paid such fitting service that what tongue could set it forth?\n\nSeveral days were spent in peace and comfort.\n\nThe treasury was empty. Tard\u012b Beg Kh\u0101n had a great deal of money, and the Emperor having asked him for a considerable loan, he lent 80,000 ashraf\u012bs at the rate of two in ten.\u00b3 His Majesty portioned out this money to the army. He bestowed sword-belts and cap-\u00e0-pie dresses on the r\u0101n\u0101 and his sons. Many people bought fresh horses here.\n\nM\u012br Sh\u0101h Husain had killed the r\u0101n\u0101's father. For this, amongst other reasons, the r\u0101n\u0101 collected 2,000 or 3,000 good soldiers and set out with the Emperor for Bhakkar.\u2074\n\nIn 'Umrk\u014dt he left many people, and his family and relations, and also Khw\u0101ja Mu'azzam to have charge of the haram. \u1e24am\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b Begam was with child. Three days after his Majesty's departure, and in the early morning of Sunday, the fourth day of the revered Rajab, 949H.,\u2075\n\n---\n\n1 The little desert town must indeed have seemed a haven after the terrible journey, and not least so to the young wife who some two months later became the mother of Akbar. Hum\u0101y\u016bn reached 'Umrk\u014dt on August 22nd, 1542 (Jum\u0101da I. 10th, 949H.).\n\n2 Text, passim, ra'n\u0101. The 'Umrk\u014dt r\u0101n\u0101's name was Pars\u0101d.\n\n3 (?) 20 per cent. Cf. Mem., 138.\n\n4 After a stay of seven weeks in 'Umrk\u014dt.\n\n5 October 15th, 1542.\nthere was born his imperial Majesty, the world's refuge and conqueror, Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Akbar Gh\u0101z\u012b. The moon was in Leo. It was of very good omen that the birth was in a fixed Sign, and the astrologers said a child so born would be fortunate and long-lived. The Emperor was some thirty miles away when Tard\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n took the news to him. He was highly delighted, and by way of reward and largesse (ni\u1e63\u0101r) for the tidings he forgave all soever of Tard\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n's past offences. He gave the child the name he had heard in his dream at L\u0101h\u014dr, the Emperor Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Akbar.\n\nOn leaving this place, the Emperor went towards Bhakkar with as many as 10,000 men who had gathered round him, people of the r\u0101n\u0101 and of the outlying tribes and S\u016bdmas (Sodhas) and Sam\u012bchas. They reached the district of J\u016bn, where there was one of Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain's servants with some troopers. He fled. Here there was the Mirror Garden, a very pleasant and enjoyable place where the Emperor alighted. He assigned its villages (? of J\u016bn) in j\u0101g\u012br to his followers.\n\nIt is a six days' journey from J\u016bn to Tatta. The Emperor was as much as six months in J\u016bn, and brought his family and people and the whole 'Umrk\u014dt party there. The Emperor Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Akbar was six months old when they took him to J\u016bn. The party which had come from various places with the royal family and the \u1e25aram now broke up. As for the r\u0101n\u0101, he marched off at midnight for his own country, on account of a coolness caused by some talk between him and Tard\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n. All the S\u016bdmas and Sam\u012bchas went off by agree-\n\n---\n\n1 Cf. B. & H., II., 256, for stories of the taking of J\u016bn.\n2 Other writers say nine.\n3 Hamida and her baby were good travellers.

I do not find this word in dictionaries, and translate tentatively on the analogy of shukr-\u0101b, a tiff.\n5 Other writers give Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101z\u012b as the second in the quarrel.\nINCIDENTS FOLLOWING THE BIRTH OF AKBAR.\n\nAt the top, on the right, are Hamida-ban\u016b and the child; on the left, the news is announced with sound of castanets and tambourines.\n\nIn the middle, the hour of birth is being communicated to the astrologers.\n\nAt the foot, the news is being given to Hum\u0101y\u016bn by Tardi Beg, and is welcomed by music and dancing.\n\n[To face p. 158.]\nment with him, and the Emperor was left alone, as before, with his own people.\n\nHe sent brave Shaikh 'Al\u012b Beg (Jal\u0101'\u012br) and Mu\u1e93affar Beg Turkman towards the large district of Jajk\u0101 (H\u0101j-k\u0101n). (49b) M\u012brz\u0101 Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain sent a force to attack him, and there was a famous fight. At last Mu\u1e93affar Beg was routed and fled, and Shaikh 'Al\u012b Beg (Jal\u0101'\u012br) was killed and perished with all his men.\u00b9\n\nA squabble arose between Kh\u0101lid Beg\u00b2 and Tarsh Beg, a brother of Sh\u0101ham Kh\u0101n Jal\u0101'\u012br and his Majesty turned all his favour to Tarsh Beg. So Kh\u0101lid Beg deserted and went with all his men to M\u012br Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain. Then the Emperor ordered Kh\u0101lid Beg\u2019s mother, Sul\u1e6d\u0101nam, to prison and this made Gul-barg\u00b3 Begam angry. Then he forgave Sul\u1e6d\u0101nam and gave her leave to go to the blessed Makka with Gul-barg Begam. Soon after this Tarsh Beg also deserted. The Emperor cursed him, and said: \u2018For his sake, I dealt harshly with Kh\u0101lid Beg, who on this account left the circle of the faithful for the circle of the disloyal. Tarsh Beg will die young.\u2019 So it was! Fifteen days later, a servant killed him with a knife as he lay sleeping in a boat. When the Emperor heard of it he grew sad and thoughtful. (50a) Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain M\u012brz\u0101 brought boats up the river to near J\u016bn, and his men and the Emperor\u2019s often fought on board, and many were killed on both sides. Day by day there were desertions to Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain. In one of these fights was killed Mull\u0101 T\u0101ju-d-d\u012bn whom his Majesty held in the greatest favour as a pearl of knowledge.\n\nThere was a squabble between Tard\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n and Mu\u02bfn\u012bm Kh\u0101n. Mu\u02bfn\u012bm Kh\u0101n consequently deserted.\n\n\u00b9 A stubborn fight, and fateful for Hum\u0101y\u016bn. It occurred in November, 1543.\n\u00b2 Son of Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn 'Al\u012b Khal\u012bfa Barl\u016bs and of Sul\u1e6d\u0101nam who appears to be Gul-badan\u2019s former hostess (14a).\n\u00b3 Daughter of Khal\u012bfa, and as such sister or half-sister of Kh\u0101lid, and daughter or stepdaughter of Sul\u1e6d\u0101nam. She is, I believe, the Gul-barg of earlier episodes and a wife of Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\nVery few am\u012brs remained; amongst them were Tard\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n and M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u0101dg\u0101r and M\u012brz\u0101 Payanda Mu\u1e25ammad and Mu\u1e25ammad Wal\u012b and Nad\u012bm k\u016bka and Raushan k\u016bka and Khadang\\(^1\\) the chamberlain. Then there was word brought: \u2018Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n has reached J\u0101jk\u0101 (H\u0101j-k\u0101n) on his way from Gujr\u0101t.\u2019 The Emperor was delighted, and ordered Khadang and others to give him honourable meeting.\n\nMeantime Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain M\u012brz\u0101 had heard of Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n\u2019s coming and sent to capture him. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n rashly went into a hollow, and there they fell upon him.\\(^{50b}\\) Khadang the chamberlain was killed. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n and the rest escaped, and the kh\u0101n came and paid his respects to the Emperor.\n\nAt this time letters arrived (addressed to) M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l for his Majesty from Qar\u0101cha Kh\u0101n, saying: \u2018You have been long near Bhakkar, and during the whole time Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain M\u012brz\u0101 has given no sign of good-will but the reverse. By Heaven\u2019s grace, an easy way is open, and it is best for the Emperor to come here (to Qandah\u0101r). This is really advisable. If he will not come, come you yourself without fail.\u2019 As his Majesty\u2019s coming was delayed, Qar\u0101cha Kh\u0101n went out and met M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l, and made over the town to him (in the autumn of 1541).\n\nM\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Askar\u012b was in Ghazn\u012bn, and to him M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n wrote: \u2018Qar\u0101cha Kh\u0101n has given over Qandah\u0101r to M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l. Qandah\u0101r must be considered.\u2019 His idea was to take it from M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l.\n\nOn hearing of these things, his Majesty came to his aunt Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam,\\(^2\\) and said with great urgency: \u2018Pray do\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Probably the father of Maywa-j\u0101n. Bair\u0101m arrived April 12th, 1543 (Mu\u1e25arram 7th, 950H.).\n\n\\(^2\\) From this it would seem that Kh\u0101nz\u0101da was in Sind with Hum\u0101y\u016bn. No other writer, I believe, mentions this or the embassy on which she is now sent. The Uzbegs and Turkm\u0101ns do not appear \u00e0propos here. If, as Gul-badan says,\u2014and her authority is good,\u2014Kh\u0101nz\u0101da now went to Qandah\u0101r, she will have gone on to K\u0101bul, possibly with Hind\u0101l after he surrendered the town to K\u0101mr\u0101n. Of Mahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja, Kh\u0101nz\u0101da\u2019s husband, I find no mention made by any\nNAUTCH IN CELEBRATION OF AKBAR'S BIRTH.\n\n[To page p. 160.]\nme the honour of going to Qandah\u0101r and advising M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l and M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n. (51a) Tell them that the Uzbegs and the Turkm\u0101ns are near them, and that the best plan is to be friends amongst themselves. If M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n will agree to carry out what I have written to him, I will do what his heart desires.'\n\nM\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n came to Qandah\u0101r four days after the begam's arrival.\u00b9 Day after day he urged: 'Read the khutba in my name'; and again and again M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l said: 'In his life-time his Majesty Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u012b gave his throne to the Emperor Hum\u0101y\u016bn and named him his successor. We all agreed to this, and up till now have read the khutba in his name. There is no way of changing the khutba.'\u00b2 M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n wrote to her Highness, Dil-d\u0101r Begam:\u00b3 'I have come from K\u0101bul with you in mind. It is strange that you should not once have come to see me. (51b) Be a mother to me as you are to M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l.' At last Dil-d\u0101r Begam went to see him, and he said: 'Now I shall not let you go till you send for M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l.' Dil-d\u0101r Begam said: 'Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam is your elder kinswoman, and oldest and highest of you all. Ask her the truth about the khutba.' So then he spoke to \u0100ka. Her Highness Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam answered: 'If you ask me! well! as his Majesty Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u012b decided it and gave his throne to the Emperor Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and as you, all of you, have read the khutba in his name till now, so now regard him as your superior and remain in obedience to him.'\n\nTo cut the matter short, M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n besieged Qandah\u0101r and kept on insisting about the khutba for four\n\n\u00b9 She had a weary journey from J\u016bn to Qandah\u0101r, and K\u0101mr\u0101n had another, but less toilsome, from K\u0101bul. K\u0101mr\u0101n kept Hind\u0101l besieged, but there seems to have been a good deal of communication between besiegers and beleaguered.\n\n\u00b2 Our memory is better than the begam's, and we remember that Hind\u0101l found no difficulty in changing the khutba to his own name in Dihli.\n\n\u00b3 She would be probably with her son Hind\u0101l in the fort.\nmonths. At last he settled it in this way: 'Very well! the Emperor is now far away. Read the khutba in my name and when he comes back, read it in his.' As the siege had drawn out to great length, and people had gradually come to cruel straits, there was no help for it; the khutba was read. (52a) He gave Qandah\u0101r to M\u012brz\u0101 'Askar\u012b and promised Ghazn\u012bn to M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l. When they reached Ghazn\u012bn, he assigned the Lamgh\u0101nat and the mountain passes (Tangayh\u0101)\u00b9 to the m\u012brz\u0101, and all those promises were false.\u00b2\n\nM\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l went off to Badakhsh\u0101n, and settled down in Khost and Andar-\u0101b. M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n said to Dil-d\u0101r Begam: 'Go and fetch him.' When she arrived, the m\u012brz\u0101 said: 'I have withdrawn myself from the turmoil of soldiering, and even\u00b3 Khost is a hermitage. I have quite settled down.' The begam answered: 'If you intend to lead the darvish-life, even\u00b3 K\u0101bul is a hermitage. Live where your family and kinsfolk are. That is the better plan.' Then she made him come, and for awhile he lived as a darvish in K\u0101bul.\n\nAbout this time, M\u012br Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain sent to the Emperor to say: 'The course favouring fortune is for you to march for Qandah\u0101r. That is the better plan.' His Majesty was willing, and replied: 'Horses and camels are scarce in my camp; give me some to travel with to Qandah\u0101r.' (52b) Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain M\u012brz\u0101 agreed, and said: 'There are a thousand camels on the other side of the river, which I will send to you as soon as you have crossed.'\n\n[If words by Khw\u0101ja Kasak '(? Kis\u012bk), kinsman of Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101z\u012b, are recorded about the journey from Bhakkar and Sind, they are copied from the writings of the said Khw\u0101ja Kasak.\u2074]\n\n\u00b9 (?) The Tang\u012b of Rudyard Kipling.\n\u00b2 The T\u016br\u012bkh-i-bad\u0101y\u016bn\u012b states that Ghazn\u012bn was given to Hind\u0101l and then taken away, and Mr. Erskine comments on this as probably untrue. (B. & H., II. 265 n.) Gul-badan here supports 'Abdu-l-q\u0101dir.\n\u00b3 'as good as any other place' is perhaps the import of the ham.\n\u2074 We surmise that this is a gloss of Gul-badan, who has copied from a diary or writings of Khw\u0101ja Kasak. This name may be the T\u00fcrk\u012b k\u012bst\u012bk, a guard, a sentinel. No Persian word seems appropriate.\nHYMN OF PRAISE FOR AKBAR'S BIRTH.\n\nOf especial interest are the faces of the open-mouthed singers. Hamida-b\u0101n\u016b is probably the featureless person on the estrade.\n\n[To face p. 162.]\nAt length the Emperor went on board boats, with kinsfolk and family, army and the rest, and travelled for three days on the great river. At the frontier of Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s territory is a village called Nu\u0101s\u012b. Here they halted, and his Majesty sent Sult\u0101n Quli, the head-camel-driver, to fetch the camels. Sult\u0101n Quli brought a thousand, all of which his Majesty gave to his am\u012brs, and soldiers, and others, ordering them to be apportioned.\n\nThe camels were such that one might say they had not known city, or load, or man for seven, or rather seventy, generations. As horses were few, many people took camels to ride on, and what were left were assigned for the baggage. Every camel which was mounted, at once flung its rider to the ground, and took its way to the jungle. (53a) Every pack-camel, when it heard the sound of horses\u2019 feet, jumped and bounded and tossed off its load, and went off and away to the jungle. If a load was fixed so fast that, jump as it would, it could not get it off, it carried it away and ran with it into the jungle. This was the way the Emperor started for Qandah\u0101r. Some 200 camels must have gone off like this.\n\nSh\u0101h Husain M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s head-camel-driver Ma\u1e25m\u016bd was in Siw\u012b (S\u012bb\u012b), and when the Emperor came near, he strengthened the citadel and retired into it. His Majesty came prosperously to within twelve miles\u2019 distance. Then word was brought that M\u012br All\u0101h-dost and B\u0101b\u0101 J\u016bj\u016bk had arrived in Siw\u012b from K\u0101bul two days earlier, and were going on to (visit) Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain M\u012brz\u0101. By them M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n had sent a dress of honour, and tip\u016bch\u0101q horses, and much fruit, and they were to ask for M\u012brz\u0101 Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain\u2019s daughter.\n\nThe Emperor said to Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101z\u012b: \u2018As there is the\n\n---\n\n1 Run\u0101\u012b, B. & H., II. 262. The text is clear.\n2 Both these names may be sobriquets. Abu'l-fa\u017cl names Shaikh 'Abdu-l-wahab as All\u0101h-dost's companion. (A. N., Bib. Ind. ed. I. 189 et seq.)\n3 J\u016bj\u016bk is perhaps the T\u00fcrk\u012b \u2018sweet-savoured,\u2019 and an epithet of 'Abdu-l-wahab, a lawyer with persuasive tongue.\n4 The daughter has already been named as promised.\ntie of father and son\\(^1\\) between you and All\u0101h-dost, write and ask him in what way M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n stands towards me, and what he will do if I go into his neighbourhood.' (53b) He also gave this order to Khw\u0101ja Kasak: 'Go to S\u012bw\u012b, and ask M\u012br All\u0101h-dost whether he thinks it advisable for me to come to K\u0101bul.' The khw\u0101ja set out, and the Emperor said: 'We will not march till you have returned.'\n\nWhen the khw\u0101ja came near S\u012bw\u012b, Ma\u1e25m\u016bd, the head-camel-driver, caught him, and asked: 'Why are you here?' 'To buy horses and camels,' he answered. Ma\u1e25m\u016bd ordered: 'Feel under his arm and search his cap. Heaven forbid that he should have brought a letter to win over All\u0101h-dost and B\u0101b\u0101 J\u016bj\u016bk.' They searched, and brought out the letter from under his arm. He had no chance to twist it into a fold.\\(^2\\) Ma\u1e25m\u016bd took it and read it, and, not letting the khw\u0101ja go, forthwith conveyed All\u0101h-dost and B\u0101b\u0101 J\u016bj\u016bk into the fort, and with various roughnesses made them swear: 'We had no knowledge of his coming here.' (54a) (?) He has taken the initiative;\\(^3\\) and 'Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101z\u012b is related to us and he was with M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n,\\(^4\\) and this is why he has written.' Ma\u1e25m\u016bd decided to send all three to Sh\u0101h Husain, and M\u012br All\u0101h-dost and B\u0101b\u0101 J\u016bj\u016bk spent the whole night smoothing him down and entreating him, and in the end they were set free.\n\nM\u012br All\u0101h-dost sent 3,000\\(^5\\) pomegranates and 100 quinces for his Majesty's use, and wrote no letter, because he was afraid it might fall into the wrong hands. By word of mouth he sent to say: 'If a letter should come from M\u012brz\u0101 Askar\u012b or the am\u012brs, it would not be bad to go to K\u0101bul;\n\n---\n\n1 Probably a spiritual relationship; that of religious teacher and disciple.\n2 (?) to toss it secretly into a corner.\n3 sabq khuv\u0101nda ast. Perhaps Kasak as a pupil 'has said his lessons to us,' i.e., to All\u0101h-dost.\n4 He had been K\u0101mr\u0101n's div\u0101n up to the time when the royal family left L\u0101h\u014dr, and he joined Hum\u0101y\u016bn when the brothers parted for Sind and for K\u0101bul.\n5 Text, s\u012b\u1e63\u0101d, but perhaps only 300 should be read.\nTHE EMPEROR AKBAR\n('ARSH-\u0100SH\u012aY\u0100N\u012a).\n\n[To face p. 164.]\nbut if not, it will be clear to your Majesty that nothing is to be gained by going. You have few followers. What, then, will happen?'\n\nKasak came and reported this. The Emperor was stupefied and bewildered, and said: 'What is to be done? Where am I to go?' They all consulted together. (54b) Tard\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n and Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n gave it as their opinion that it was impossible to decide to go anywhere but to the north and Shal-mast\u0101n,\u00b9 the frontier of Qandah\u0101r. 'There are many Afghans in those parts,' they said, 'whom we shall draw over to our side. M\u012brz\u0101 'Askar\u012b's people, too, will join us.'\n\nHaving settled it in this way, they recited the f\u0101ti\u1e25a and went, march by march, for Qandah\u0101r. Near Shal-mast\u0101n they halted in a village named Ran\u012b (? Ral\u012b), but as it had snowed and rained, and was extremely cold, they determined to go on to Shal-mast\u0101n. At afternoon prayer-time an Uzbeg youth, mounted on a sorry and tired-out pony, came in, and cried out: 'Mount, your Majesty! I will explain on the way; time presses. There is no time to talk.'\u00b2 The Emperor mounted the very hour the alarm was given, and went off.\n\nHe went two arrows' flight, and then sent Khw\u0101ja Mu\u02bfazzam and Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n to fetch \u1e24am\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b Begam. (55a) They went and mounted her, but there was not a chink of time in which to take the Emperor Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Akb\u0101r. Just when the begam left the camp to join his Majesty, M\u012brz\u0101 'Askar\u012b came up with 2,000 troopers. There was an outcry, and when he heard it, he entered the camp\u00b3 and asked: 'Where is the Emperor?' People said: 'He went hunting long ago.' So the m\u012brz\u0101 knew that his Majesty had gone away just as he himself\n\n\u00b9 Approximately Quetta. The route seems to have been over the Bolan.\n\u00b2 The youth was Chup\u012b Bah\u0101d\u016br, a former servant of Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\n\u00b3 Gul-badan's story differs in some details from that told by other writers.\n\u2074 Late in 950H. (1543). The little Akbar reached Qandah\u0101r on December 15th, 1543.\ncame in. Then he took possession of the Emperor Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Akbar, and gave him in charge to his wife Sult\u0101nam,\\(^1\\) who showed him much kindness and affection. He made all the royal followers march, saying: 'Go to Qandah\u0101r.'\n\nHis Majesty, when he left, took the road to the mountains. He went eight miles, and then travelled as fast as possible.\\(^2\\) (55b) He had with him Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n, Khw\u0101ja Mu\u02bfazzam, Khw\u0101ja Ni\u0101z\u012b, Nad\u012bm k\u016bka\\(^3\\) and Raushan k\u016bka, and H\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, and B\u0101b\u0101-dost the paymaster, and M\u012brz\u0101 Qul\u012b Beg ch\u016bl\u012b,\\(^4\\) and Haidar Mu\u1e25ammad the master of the horse, and Shaikh Y\u016bsuf ch\u016bl\u012b, and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm the chamberlain, and Hasan \u1e24al\u012b, the chamberlain, and Ya\u02bfq\u016bb the keeper of the armoury, and \u1e24am\u012bd the superintendent and the royal agent (mulk-mukht\u0101r), and Sambal captain of a thousand, and Khw\u0101ja Kasak.\\(^5\\)\n\nKhw\u0101ja Gh\u0101zi says:\\(^6\\) 'I also was in attendance.' This company went with the Emperor, and \u1e24am\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b Begam says,\\(^6\\) 'There were as many as thirty people,' and that of women there was, besides herself, the wife of Hasan \u1e24al\u012b, the chamberlain.\n\nThe prayer before sleep had passed before they reached the foot of the mountains. The snow lay deep, so there was no road to go up by. Their minds were full of anxiety lest that unjust creature, M\u012brz\u0101 \u1e24askar\u012b, should follow them. At last they found a way up, and climbed it in some sort of fashion. They were all night in the snow, and (at first) there was neither wood for fire nor food to eat.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I believe she was in Qandah\u0101r, and that she received the child on his arrival there.\n\n\\(^2\\) Perhaps he rode four kos, and then, having waited for \u1e24am\u012bda, hurried on.\n\n\\(^3\\) His wife, M\u0101ham anaga, remained behind with Akbar. With Akbar was also Atka Kh\u0101n (Shamsu-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad) and his wife, J\u012b-j\u012b anaga.\n\n\\(^4\\) Hun\u0101y\u016bn's sobriquet for those who went to Persia with him; from ch\u016bl, a desert. Others in this list might claim it.\n\n\\(^5\\) Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn A\u1e25mad puts the number of the party at twenty-two.\n\n\\(^6\\) The tense used suggests conference and talking over. Jauhar says that Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101zi joined Hun\u0101y\u016bn in Persia from Makka. This looks like a contradiction of Jauhar.\nThey grew very hungry and feeble. (56a) The Emperor gave orders to kill a horse. There was no cooking-pot, so they boiled some of the flesh in a helmet, and some they roasted. They made fires on all four sides, and with his own blessed hand the Emperor roasted some meat which he ate. He used to say: \u2018My very head was frozen by the intense cold.\u2019\n\nMorning came at last, and he pointed to another mountain, and said: \u2018There are people on that; there will be many Bil\u016bch\u012bs there; and there we must go.\u2019 On they went, and reached the place in two days. They saw a few houses near them, and a few savage Bil\u016bch\u012bs whose speech is the tongue of the ghouls of the waste.\n\nThe Emperor halted on the skirt of the mountain. There were about thirty people with him. The Bil\u016bch\u012bs saw him, and collected and came near. He had settled comfortably in his tent, so they knew from far off that he was halting. They said to one another: \u2018If we seize these people and take them to M\u012brz\u0101 \u1e24askar\u012b, he will certainly give us their arms, and many gifts besides.\u2019 (56b)\n\nHasan \u1e24al\u012b, the chamberlain, had a Bil\u016bch\u012b wife who understood what the ghouls of the waste were saying, and who made it known that they meant mischief. Early in the morning the Emperor thought of marching on, but they said: \u2018Our chief is not here. When he comes, you shall go.\u2019 Besides this, the time had become unsuitable, and so the whole night was spent there in strict watchfulness.\n\nPart of the night had gone when the chief arrived. He waited on the Emperor, and said: \u2018A farm\u0101n has come from M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n and M\u012brz\u0101 \u1e24askar\u012b, in which it is written: \u201cIt is reported that the Emperor may visit your dwellings. If he does, beware!\u2014a thousand times beware!\u2014of letting him go. Seize him and bring him to us. You can keep his goods and horses. Take him to Qandah\u0101r.\u201d As I had not seen your Majesty, I at first had this evil thought, but now I will sacrifice my life and the lives of my family, I have five or six sons, for your Majesty\u2019s head,\nor rather for one hair of it. (57a) Go where you wish. God protect you! M\u012brz\u0101 'Askar\u012b may do what he likes.' The Emperor gave him a ruby and a pearl and some other things.\n\nAt dawn he marched to honour Fort B\u0101b\u0101 H\u0101j\u012b\u00b9 by a visit. He reached it in two days. It belongs to the Garm-s\u012br,\u00b2 and lies on the river (Halmand). There are many sayyids there, and they waited on the Emperor and showed him hospitality.\n\nNext morning Khw\u0101ja 'Al\u0101walu-d-d\u012bn (Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn) Mahm\u016bd,\u00b3 having left M\u012brz\u0101 'Askar\u012b, came with an offering of a string of mules, and one of horses and tents, etc., whatever he had. Once more the royal heart was at ease. H\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n k\u016bk\u016b\u2074 brought thirty or forty troopers and offered a string of mules.\n\nBeing helpless because of the disunion of his brothers\u2075 and the desertion of his am\u012brs, it now seemed best to the Emperor,\u2014with reliance on the Causer of causes,\u2014to decide upon going to Khur\u0101s\u0101n.\u2076 (57b)\n\nAfter many stages and a journey of many days, he came to parts adjacent to Khur\u0101s\u0101n. When Sh\u0101h Tahm\u0101s (sic) heard that he had reached the Halmand, he remained sunk in wonder and thought, and said: 'The Emperor Hum\u0101y\u016bn has come to our frontier by the perfidious revolution of the firmament,\u2014the firmament unpropitious and crooked of gait! The Lord, whose existence is necessary, has led him here!'\n\nHe sent all sorts of people to give honourable reception,\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Fort of the Pilgrim Father.\n\u00b2 i.e., a warm climate, a winter habitation in low ground, and cultivated fields.\n\u00b3 He was a revenue-collector of the m\u012brz\u0101.\n\u2074 Son of B\u0101b\u0101 Q\u016bshka, an intimate of B\u0101bar.\n\u2075 K\u0101mr\u0101n was master of K\u0101bul and Ghazn\u012b, Qandah\u0101r, Khutl\u0101n and Badakhsh\u0101n. 'Askar\u012b was attached to his full-brother's fortunes, and Hind\u0101l was a prisoner in K\u0101bul. Sh\u012br Sh\u0101h ruled B\u0101bar's Indian Empire, and Sh\u0101h Husain was in Sind. Certainly there seemed no 'crack' to hold Hum\u0101y\u016bn. The date is December, 1548.\n\u2076 i.e., on his way to Persia proper. Hum\u0101y\u016bn's messenger to the Sh\u0101h was Chup\u012b Bah\u0101dur. (55a and n.)\nnobles and grandees, low and high, great and small. All came to the Halmand to meet the Emperor.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe Sh\u0101h sent all his brothers to meet his Majesty,\u2014Bahr\u0101m M\u012brz\u0101, and Alq\u0101s M\u012brz\u0101, and S\u0101m M\u012brz\u0101. All came and embraced him, and escorted him with full honour and respect. As they drew near (the Sh\u0101h) his brothers sent him word, and he also came riding to meet the Emperor. They embraced. (58a) The friendship and concord of those two high-placed p\u0101shas was as close as two nut-kernels in one shell.\\(^2\\) Great unanimity and good feeling ensued, so that during his Majesty's stay in that country, the Sh\u0101h often went to his quarters, and on days when he did not, the Emperor went to his.\n\nIn Khur\u0101s\u0101n\\(^3\\) his Majesty visited all the gardens and the flower-gardens, and the splendid buildings put up by Sult\u0101n \u1e24usain M\u012brz\u0101, and the grand structures of olden days.\n\nThere was hunting eight times while he was in \u2018Ir\u0101q, and each time trouble was taken for him also. \u1e24am\u012bd\u0101-b\u0101n\u016b Begam used to enjoy the sight from a distance in either a camel or a horse litter. Sh\u0101hz\u0101da Sult\u0101nam,\\(^4\\) the Sh\u0101h's sister, used to ride on horseback, and take her stand\n\n---\n\n1 He had crossed the river without receiving invitation or permission, because of K\u0101mr\u0101n's threatened approach. The incidents of Hum\u0101y\u016bn's visit to Persia are very entertaining. (B. & H., II, 275 et seq.)\n\n2 A figure of speech too compact to leave room for the facts. The intercourse of the p\u0101shas was dramatic with human passion and foible. Much of the story would be distasteful to Gul-badan's family pride and vexatious to her orthodoxy.\n\n3 Not only in Khur\u0101s\u0101n but on and off the route to Tahm\u0101sp's summer quarters where the p\u0101shas met, did Hum\u0101y\u016bn visit noteworthy places. He saw Har\u012bt as his father had done, and later his devious journey took him to J\u0101m, where he saw the shrine of his own and of \u1e24am\u012bd\u0101's ancestor, the Terrible Elephant, Ahmad. He visited the tomb of the Founder of the \u0160af\u012b dynasty at Ardabil, and the date of his visit (1544) makes it probable that he trod that 'Holy Carpet' of Ardabil which had been woven in 1540 for the shrine and which now attracts our respectful admiration in the Oriental Section of the Victoria and Albert Museum (S. K. M.).\n\n4 This lady afforded Hum\u0101y\u016bn vital assistance in Persia, and even pleaded for his life when it was in the balance. She was highly esteemed by Tahm\u0101sp, and had influence in state affairs.\nbehind her brother. His Majesty said (to Ham\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b): \u2018There was a woman riding behind the Sh\u0101h at the hunt. She stood with her reins held by a white-bearded man. People told me it was Sh\u0101hz\u0101da Sult\u0101nam, the Sh\u0101h\u2019s sister.\u2019 (58b) In short, the Sh\u0101h showed the Emperor much hospitality and courtesy, and laid a charge (on his sister) to show motherly and sisterly hospitality and sympathy (to Ham\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b Begam).\u00b9\n\nOne day, when Sh\u0101hz\u0101da Sult\u0101nam had entertained the begam, the Sh\u0101h said to her: \u2018When (next) you offer hospitality, let it be arranged outside the city.\u2019 It was on a beautiful plain, rather more than four miles out, that they pitched tents (khaima) and folding-tents (khirga) and an audience-tent (b\u0101rga), and also set up chatr\u00b2 and \u1e6d\u0101q.\u00b3\n\nIn Khur\u0101s\u0101n and those parts they use enclosing screens (sar\u0101parda), but they do not put them at the back. The Emperor set up an all-round screen after the Hind\u016b fashion (hind\u016b\u0101na). Having pitched the tents, the Sh\u0101h\u2019s people put coloured chicks (cheghh\u0101) all round. His kinswomen and his paternal aunt were there, and his sisters and the ladies of his haram, and the wives of the kh\u0101ns and sult\u0101ns and am\u012brs, about 1,000 women in all splendour and adornment.\n\nThat day Sh\u0101hz\u0101da Sult\u0101nam asked Ham\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b Begam: (59a) \u2018Are such chatr and \u1e6d\u0101q met with in Hind\u016bstan?\u2019 The begam answered: \u2018They say two d\u0101ng\u2074 with respect to Khur\u0101s\u0101n, and four d\u0101ng with respect to Hin-\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 An obscure passage in the text, and conjectural only in translation. The Persian words I have rendered \u2018motherly and sisterly\u2019 are m\u0101dar\u0101na wa khw\u0101har\u0101na. On this same page occurs hind\u016b\u0101na; at 48b, n\u012bk\u0101h\u0101na, and at 62a, p\u0101dsh\u0101h\u0101na.\n\n\u00b2 (?) umbrella-shaped tents.\n\n\u00b3 round-topped tents or balconies, or arched erections.\n\n\u2074 or d\u0101mak. Hazarding a guess, the meaning \u2018quarter of the world\u2019 seems fittest to select from the several of d\u0101ng or d\u0101nak. Others conceivably applicable are \u2018a small grain\u2019 (anglice, peppercorn in this connection), and the sixth of anything (anglice, the colloquial \u2018fraction\u2019). Doubtless my difficulty is none to those experienced in colloquial Persian.\n\nHam\u012bda\u2019s ready use of a colloquial phrase to express that the reputedly greater contains the less is neat and diplomatic.\nd\u016bst\u0101n. When a thing is found in two d\u0101ng, it is clear it will be found better in four.'\n\nSh\u0101h Sult\u0101nam said also, in reply to her own paternal aunt, and in confirmation of the begam's words: 'Aunt, it is strange that you ask, \"Where are two d\u0101ng? where are four d\u0101ng?\" It is clear anything would be found better and more wonderful (in four than in two).'\n\nThey passed the whole day very well in sociable festivity. At the time of eating, all the am\u012brs' wives stood and served, and the Sh\u0101h's ladies placed\u00b9 food before Sh\u0101hz\u0101da Sult\u0101nam.\n\nMoreover, they were hospitable\u00b2 with all sorts of stuffs, embroidered and others, to Ham\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b Begam, as was incumbent and fitting. The Sh\u0101h went on in advance\u00b3 and was in his Majesty's quarters till the prayer before sleep. (59b) When he heard that Ham\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b Begam had arrived, he rose from the presence and went home. To such a height of pleasantness and kindness was he amiable!\n\nRaushan k\u016bka, spite of his former fidelity and services, was now faithless, in that foreign and perilous country, about some valuable rubies. These used to be kept in the Emperor's amulet-case (\u1e6dum\u0101r\u2074), and of this he and the begam knew and no one else. If he went away anywhere, he used to give the amulet-case into her charge. One day she was going to wash her head, so she bundled the case up in a handkerchief, and put it on the Emperor's bed. Raushan k\u016bka thought this a good chance to steal five rubies. Then he agreed with Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101zi, and trusted them to him, meaning by-and-by to barter them away.\n\nWhen the begam came back from washing her head, the Emperor gave her the amulet-case, and she at once knew\n\n\u00b9 m\u0101ndand, used transitively; also at 4a.\n\u00b2 mihm\u0101n\u012b kardand.

In the way of gifts, or perhaps by lavish decoration.\n\u00b3 i.e., from the place of entertainment to the town.\n\u2074 Also \u1e6d\u016bm\u0101r, an amulet-case of gold or silver suspended on the neck.\nfrom its lightness in her hand that it had lost weight, and said so. (60a) The Emperor asked: \u2018How is this? Except you and me, no one knows about them. What can have happened? Who has taken them?\u2019 He was astonished.\n\nThe begam said to her brother, Khw\u0101ja Mu\u02bfazzam: \u2018So and so has happened. If at this pinch you will act the brother to me and will make inquiry in some way quietly, you will save me from what one may call disgrace. Otherwise, as long as I live, I shall be ashamed in the royal presence.\u2019\n\nKhw\u0101ja Mu\u02bfazzam said: \u2018One thing occurs to me! I, who am so closely connected with his Majesty, have not the means to buy even a poor pony,\\(^1\\) but Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101zi and Raushan k\u016bka\\(^2\\) have each bought themselves a tip\u016bch\u0101q horse. They have not paid the money for them yet. This purchase is not without a ray of hope.\u2019\n\nThe begam answered: \u2018O brother! now is the time for brotherliness! That transaction must certainly be looked into.\u2019 Khw\u0101ja Mu\u02bfazzam answered: \u2018O elder moon-sister!\\(^3\\) tell no one about it. Heaven willing, I have hope that the right will be righted.\u2019 (60b)\n\nHe went out, and inquired at the house of the horse-dealers: \u2018For what price did you sell those horses? When is the money promised? What security has been given for the payment?\u2019 The dealers answered: \u2018Both men promised us rubies, and took the horses.\u2019\n\nFrom them he went to the khw\u0101ja\u2019s servant, and said: \u2018Where is the khw\u0101ja\u2019s wallet, with his honorary dress and his clothes?\\(^4\\) Where does he keep it?\u2019 The servant answered: \u2018My khw\u0101ja has no wallet and no clothes. He has one high cap which, when he goes to sleep, he\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Text, t\u016bt\u016b.\n\n\\(^2\\) Jauhar states that amongst other disaffected persons these two men, and a third, Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad, the spearman (nazab\u0101z), had just returned from Makka, and were of K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s party. Gul-badan makes it seem probable that Jauhar\u2019s statements apply only to Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad. (Cf. list of companions of Hum\u0101y\u016bn on his journey, 55b.)\n\n\\(^3\\) m\u0101h ch\u012bcham. Cf. 18b n..\n\n\\(^4\\) n\u016br\u012b wa p\u0101r\u012b.\nputs under his head or his arm.' Khw\u0101ja Mu'azzam saw the meaning of this, and made up his mind for certain that the rubies were with Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101z\u012b, and were kept in his high cap. He came and represented to his Majesty: 'I have found trace of those rubies in Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101z\u012b's high cap. In some way I will steal them from him. (61a) If he should come to your Majesty and seek redress against me, let your Majesty say nothing to me.' The Emperor listened, and smiled.\n\nKhw\u0101ja Mu'azzam then repeatedly played off tricks and little jokes and pleasantries on Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101z\u012b, who came and set it forth to the Emperor. 'I am a lowly man,' said he, '(?but) I have a name and a position. What does the boy Khw\u0101ja Mu'azzam mean by playing off these tricks and jokes, and making fun of me in this foreign land, and insulting me?' His Majesty said: 'On whom does he not? He is young. It often comes into his head to do terrifying and ill-bred things. Do not take it to heart. He is only a boy.'\n\nAnother day, when Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101z\u012b was seated in the reception-room, Khw\u0101ja Mu'azzam, pretending an accident, filched his cap from his head. Then he took out the matchless rubies, and laid them before his Majesty and \u1e24am\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b Begam. His Majesty smiled, and the begam was delighted, and said, 'Bravo!' and 'Mercy be upon you.' (61b)\n\nKhw\u0101ja Gh\u0101z\u012b and Raushan k\u016bka, in shame at their deed, made secret communications to the Sh\u0101h, and carried their talk so far that his heart was troubled. His Majesty saw that the Sh\u0101h's intimacy and confidence were not what they had been, and at once sent some of whatever rubies and other jewels\\(^1\\) he possessed as a gift to him, who then said: 'Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101z\u012b and Raushan k\u016bka are in fault; they turned my heart from you, and truly I used to regard you\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) It was now that Hum\u0101y\u016bn gave to the Sh\u0101h the 'diamond which had been obtained from Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm's treasury,' i.e., the Koh-i-n\u016br. *(Asiatic Quarterly Review,* April, 1899, art. 'B\u0101bar's Diamond,' H. Beveridge.)\nas a brother.' Then the two sovereigns again became of one mind, and made clean heart to one another.\n\nThe two wrong-doers were excluded from the presence, and were made over to the Sh\u0101h, who, when opportunity occurred, got possession of those rubies,\\(^1\\) and, as to the men, ordered: 'Let them be kept in custody.'\n\nHis Majesty's time in \u1e24r\u0101q was (now) spent happily. In various ways the Sh\u0101h showed good feeling, and every day sent presents of rare and strange things.\\(^{62a}\\)\n\nAt length the Sh\u0101h despatched his own son and kh\u0101ns and sultans and am\u012brs with his Majesty to help him, together with good arms and tents, folding and audience tents; and chatr and \u1e6d\u0101q and shami\u0101na, excellently wrought, and all sorts of the things necessary and fit for a king, from the mattress-warehouse and the treasury and the workshops and kitchen and buttery. In a propitious hour those two mighty sovereigns bade one another farewell, and his Majesty left that country for Qandah\u0101r.\\(^3\\)\n\nAt the time of his departure, he asked pardon from the Sh\u0101h for the offence of those two faithless ones (Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101z\u012b and Raushan k\u016bka), and, having himself forgiven them, took them with him to Qandah\u0101r.\n\nWhen M\u012brz\u0101 \u1e24askar\u012b heard (1545) that he was on his way from Khur\u0101s\u0101n and approaching Qandah\u0101r, he sent the Emperor Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Akbar to M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n in K\u0101bul, who gave him into the care of Dearest Lady, Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam, and our paternal aunt.\\(^{62b}\\) He was two and a half years old when she received him into her charge. She was very fond of him, and used to kiss his hands and feet, and say: 'They are the very hands and feet of my brother the Emperor B\u0101bar, and he is like him altogether.'\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) (? ) those already bartered away.\n\n\\(^2\\) They were, it would seem, let down by tent-ropes into the celebrated underground prison of Sulaim\u0101n's Diwan. (Jauhar, Stewart, 72.)\n\n\\(^3\\) Hum\u0101y\u016bn again indulged his love of travel and sights, and delayed so long in Persian territory that the Sh\u0101h, coming unexpectedly upon him, angrily turned him off without ceremony.\n\n\\(^4\\) The child was just over three. It was now that he and Bakhsh\u012b-b\u0101n\u016b travelled together to K\u0101bul in the snow.\nWhen M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n was sure that the Emperor was approaching Qandah\u0101r, he went to Dearest Lady and cried, and was very humble, and said with countless pains:\u00b9 \u2018Go you (May your journey be safe!) to Qandah\u0101r to the Emperor and make peace between us.\u2019\n\nWhen she left (K\u0101bul) she made over the Emperor Akbar to M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n, who gave him into the care of (Mu\u1e25t\u0101r\u012bma) Kh\u0101nam. Then she travelled as fast as possible to Qandah\u0101r. The Emperor besieged M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n\u00b2 and M\u012brz\u0101 \u2019Askar\u012b for forty days in the city, and he sent Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n on an embassy to M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n.\u00b3\n\n(63a) M\u012brz\u0101 \u2019Askar\u012b grew dejected and humble, admitted his offences, and came out and paid his duty to the Emperor, who then took possession of Qandah\u0101r (September 4th, 1545). He bestowed it upon the son of the Sh\u0101h, who in a few days fell ill and died.\u2074 When Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n\u2075 arrived, it was given into his charge.\n\nThe Emperor left \u1e24amida-b\u0101n\u016b Begam in Qandah\u0101r and set out after M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n. Dearest Lady, Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam, went with him, and at Qabal-chak\u2076 she had three days of fever. The doctors\u2019 remedies were of no avail, and on the fourth day of her illness she passed to the mercy of God. At first she was buried at Qabal-chak, but three months later her body was brought to K\u0101bul and laid in the burial-place of my royal father.\u2077\n\nDuring several years that M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n was in K\u0101bul,\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 of persuasion.\n\u00b2 The context shows that this is wrong, and so do the histories.\n\u00b3 Bair\u0101m saw Akbar in K\u0101bul, and also Hind\u0101l, Sulaim\u0101n, \u1e2aaram, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm and Y\u0101dg\u016br-n\u0101s\u012br, all under surveillance. The embassy reached K\u0101bul before Kh\u0101nz\u0101da left, and she travelled with Bair\u0101m on his return to Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\n\u2074 He was an infant.\n\u2075 The begam\u2019s chronology is faulty here. Bair\u0101m had returned before the capitulation.\n\u2076 For location of this place cf. Akbarn\u0101ma H. B., I. 477 n.. It seems to have been in the mountain district of T\u012br\u012b, between the basins of the \u1e24almand and the Arghand-\u0101b.\n\u2077 Kh\u0101nz\u0101da, Mahd\u012b (her husband) and Ab\u016b\u2019l-ma\u2019\u0101l\u012b are buried in the same spot.\nhe had never made a hostile raid,\\(^1\\) and now, all at once, when he heard of his Majesty's approach, desire to break forth (? hunt) seized him, and he went into the Haz\u0101ra country.\\(^2\\) (63b)\n\nM\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l, who had chosen the darvish's corner (in K\u0101bul), now heard of the Emperor's return from 'Ir\u0101q and Khur\u0101s\u0101n, and of his success in Qandah\u0101r. He saw his chance, and sent for M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u0101dg\u0101r-n\u0101\u0161ir, and said: 'The Emperor has come to Qandah\u0101r, and has been victorious. M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n sent Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam to sue for peace, but the Emperor did not agree to his sort of peace. The Emperor sent Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n as his envoy, and M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n did not agree to what he proposed. Now the Emperor has given Qandah\u0101r to Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n and has set out for K\u0101bul. Come now, let us, you and I, plan and agree together, and scheme how to betake ourselves to his Majesty.' M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u0101dg\u0101r-n\u0101\u0161ir agreed, and the two made their plan and compact. M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l said: 'You make up your mind to run away and when M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n hears of it, he will certainly say to me: \"M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u0101dg\u0101r-n\u0101\u0161ir has gone off; go and persuade him to come back with you.\" (64a) You go slowly, slowly on till I come. Then we will go as quickly as we can and pay our respects to the Emperor.'\n\nHaving so settled it, M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u0101dg\u0101r-n\u0101\u0161ir ran away. The news went to M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n, who came back at once to K\u0101bul and sent for M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l and said: 'Go and persuade M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u0101dg\u0101r-n\u0101\u0161ir to come back.' M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l mounted at once, and joined M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u0101dg\u0101r-n\u0101\u0161ir with all speed. Then they travelled post-haste for five or six days, when they were honoured by paying their duty to the Emperor.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) t\u0101kht raftan. I do not know what the begam wishes to say. K\u0101mr\u0101n had made hostile raids to Badakhsh\u0101n and against the Haz\u0101ras. One might read 'hunting expedition.'\n\n\\(^2\\) He had a Haz\u0101ra wife. Perhaps the passage about K\u0101mr\u0101n's hostile raid or hunting is merely an introduction to Hind\u0101l's plan of scape. (Cf. B. & H., II, 314, 315, for this story.)\nThey advised the Khim\u0101r\\(^1\\) Pass as the best route. On Ram\u1e93\u0101n 9th, 951H. (the third week of October, 1545), his Majesty ordered a halt in that pass. News of this went to M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n on the same day and disturbed him greatly. He had his tents taken out very quickly and encamped in front of the Guzar-g\u0101h.\\(^2\\) (64b)\n\nOn the 11th of the same month, the Emperor ordered a halt in the valley of (?)

For five years we had been shut out and cut off from this pleasure, so now when we were freed from the moil and pain of separation, we were lifted up by our happiness in meeting this Lord of beneficence again. Merely to look at him eased the sorrow-stricken heart and purged the blear-eyed vision. (65b) Again and again we joyfully made the prostration of thanks. There were many festive gatherings, and people sat from evening to dawn, and players and singers made continuous music. Many amusing games, full of fun, were played. Amongst them was this: Twelve players had each twenty cards and twenty shahrukhis. Whoever lost, lost those twenty shahrukhis, which would make five misqals.\u00b2 Each player gave the winner his twenty shahrukhis to add to his own.\u00b3\n\nTo widows and orphans, and kinsfolk of men who had\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 The hour was probably fixed by astrological counsel. Abul-fazl, who may follow the begam's statement, says that the entry took place on the 12th; other writers name the 10th. The only reason for dwelling on the point is the agreement of Abul-fazl and Gul-badan.\n\n\u00b2 One shahrukhi was about ten pence. Four shahrukhis made one misqal.\n\n\u00b3 Mr. Erskine says that the earliest mention of cards as made known to him by an Oriental writer is when Babar sends some to Shah Husain Arghun who was 'very fond' of them, by Mir Ali, the armour-bearer, in 938H. (1526-27). No doubt such an easy means of speeding the hours was known to the ladies of Babar's family as early as to anyone else, and Gul-badan is perhaps merely describing a new game.\nbeen wounded and killed at Chausa and Kanauj, or Bhakkar, or who were in the royal service during those intermissions,\\(^1\\) he gave pension, and rations, and water, and land, and servants. In the days of his Majesty\u2019s good fortune, great tranquillity and happiness befell soldiers and peasants. They lived without care, and put up many an ardent prayer for his long life. (66a)\n\nA few days later he sent persons to bring Ham\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b Begam from Qandah\u0101r. When she arrived, they celebrated the feast of the circumcision of the Emperor Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Akbar. Preparations were made, and after the New Year\\(^2\\) they kept splendid festivity for seventeen days. People dressed in green,\\(^3\\) and thirty or forty girls were ordered to wear green and come out to the hills. On the first day of the New Year they went out to the Hill of the Seven Brothers and there passed many days in ease and enjoyment and happiness. The Emperor Mu\u1e25ammad Akbar was five years old when they made the circumcision feast in K\u0101bul. They gave it in that same large Audience Hall Garden.\\(^4\\) They decorated all the b\u0101z\u0101rs.

The begam writes this word sometimes with a t\u0101 and sometimes with a to\u2019e.\n2 i.e., Persian era. Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn Ahmad places the date of entry into K\u0101bul by Hum\u0101y\u016bn on Ramz\u0101n 10th, 953H., and says Akbar was then four years, two months and five days old. \u2018Some place the event in the year 952H., but God knows the truth.\u2019 It is strange that there should be doubt about a historical event occurring not more than fifty years before this resigned statement was made. Ab\u016b\u2019l-fa\u1e93l gives Ramz\u0101n 12th, 952H. (November 17th, 1545), as the date of entry, which would fix the feast for March, 1546, when Akbar was three years and five months old. (Born October 15th, 1542.)\n3 Probably in honour of the spring season.\n4 This is the garden where the ladies rejoiced after the victory at P\u0101n\u012bpat.

Peasants and preachers, the pious, the poor and the needy, noble and plebeian, low and high,\u2014everybody lived in peace and comfort, passing the days in amusement and the nights in talk.\n\nThen the Emperor went to Fort Victory (Qila-i-zafar). In it was Mirz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n, who came out to fight but could not stand face to face with his Majesty and so decided to run away. The Emperor then entered the fort safe and sound. Then he went to Kishm, where, after a little while, an illness attacked his blessed frame and he slept day and night. When he came to his senses, he sent Mun'im Kh\u0101n's brother, Fa\u017c\u0101'il Beg, to K\u0101bul, and said: 'Go! comfort and reassure the people of K\u0101bul. Set them at ease in various ways. Let them not quarrel. Say: \"It began ill, but has ended well.\"'\n\nWhen Fa\u017c\u0101'il Beg had gone, he (Hum\u0101y\u016bn) went one day nearer K\u0101bul.\n\nFalse news having been sent to Mirz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n in Bhakkar, he set out post-haste for K\u0101bul. In Ghazn\u012b he killed Z\u0101hid Beg and then came on. It was morning; the K\u0101bulis were off their guard; the gates had been opened in the old way, and water-carriers and grass-cuts were going in and out, and the m\u016br\u1e93\u0101 passed into the fort with all\n\n---\n\n1 Perhaps there is expressed here a difference of degree of honour in the kh\u012blat and sar-u-p\u0101n\u012b.\n2 Sulaim\u0101n had not made submission to Hum\u0101y\u016bn,\u2014hence this expedition to Badakhsh\u0101n.\n3 He is said to have been insensible for four days. He was nursed by M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak and Bibi F\u0101\u1e6dima, an armed woman (ord\u016b-beg\u012b) of the \u1e25aram. She was, it would seem, mother of Zuhra \u0101gh\u0101, the wife of Khw\u0101ja Mu'azzam, and to save whose life Akbar nearly lost his own. (Elliot, V. 292; B. & H., II. 330 et seq.)\n4 (?) As to his health, and their own safety from K\u0101mr\u0101n's return, and the continuance of the situation as he had left it. The illness and convalescence lasted at least two months. He fell ill in Sh\u0101hd\u0101n, between Khishm and Qila-i-zafar, and Qar\u0101cha Kh\u0101n, his vaz\u012br, behaved with decision and good sense, so that Hum\u0101y\u016bn's authority was upheld.\n5 Doubtful translation. Hum\u0101y\u016bn is elsewhere said to have gone to Qila-i-zafar to recruit, and Fa\u017c\u0101'il to have arrived in K\u0101bul a few hours after the first news there of the illness. Perhaps one of these occurrences is behind this obscure statement.\n6 Husband of Bega Begam's sister.\nthese common people. He at once killed Uncle Mu\u1e25ammad Al\u012b\u00b9 who was in the hot bath. He alighted at the college of Mull\u0101 \u2018Abdu-l-kh\u0101liq.\n\nWhen the Emperor was starting for Qila-i-\u1e93afar, he placed Nauk\u0101r\u00b2 at the door of the \u1e25aram. M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n must have asked: \u2018Who is in the B\u0101l\u0101-i-\u1e25i\u1e63\u0101r?\u2019 and someone must have said: \u2018It is Nauk\u0101r.\u2019 Nauk\u0101r heard of this and at once put on a woman\u2019s dress and went out. The m\u012brz\u0101\u2019s people laid hands on the doorkeeper of the fort, and took him to M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n, who ordered him to be imprisoned. (67b) The m\u012brz\u0101\u2019s people went into the B\u0101l\u0101-i-\u1e25i\u1e63\u0101r, and plundered and destroyed innumerable things belonging to the \u1e25aram, and they made settlement\u00b3 for them in M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s court (sarkar). He put the great begams into M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Askari\u2019s house and there he shut up a room with bricks and plaster and (?) dung-cakes, and they used to give the ladies water and food from over the four walls.\u2074\n\nIn what was once M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u0101dg\u0101r-n\u0101\u0161ir\u2019s house he put Khw\u0101ja Mu\u02bfazzam\u2075 and ordered his own wives and family to stay in the palace where the royal \u1e25aram and the begams once lived. He behaved very ill indeed to the wives and families of the officers who had left him for the Emperor, ransacking and plundering all their houses and putting each family into somebody\u2019s custody.\u2076\n\nWhen the Emperor heard that M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n had come from Bhakkar and was acting in this way, he returned from Qila-i-\u1e93afar and Andar-\u0101b safe and sound to K\u0101bul. Qila-i-\u1e93afar he gave to M\u012brz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n. (68a)\n\n\u00b9 Brother of M\u0101ham Begam.\n\u00b2 Probably the servant sent with gifts by B\u0101bar from \u0100gra to K\u0101bul.

Is this an indication of Gul-badan\u2019s opinion that K\u0101mr\u0101n profited by the robbery of his relations? His cruelties at this time make theft look innocent. (B. & H., II. 336 et seq.)\n\u2074 The translation of this passage is doubtful.\n\u2075 An undue honour, perhaps prompted by the khw\u0101ja\u2019s disgrace with Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\n\u2076 Probably for the exploitation so often named in the histories.\nWhen he came near to K\u0101bul, M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n sent for her Highness my mother and for me from the house,\u00b9 and gave my mother orders to reside in the armourer\u2019s house. To me he said: \u2018This is your house as well as mine. You stay here.\u2019 \u2018Why,\u2019 I asked, \u2018should I stay here? I will stay with my mother.\u2019 He then went on: \u2018Moreover, write to Khi\u1e93r Khw\u0101ja Kh\u0101n and tell him to come and join me and to keep an easy mind, for just as M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Askar\u012b and M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l are my brothers, so is he. Now is the time to help.\u2019 I answered: \u2018Khi\u1e93r Khw\u0101ja Kh\u0101n has no way of recognising a letter\u00b2 from me. I have never written to him myself. He writes to me when he is away, by the tongue of his sons. Write yourself what is in your mind.\u2019 At last he sent Mahd\u012b Sult\u0101n\u00b3 and Sh\u012br \u2018Al\u012b to fetch the kh\u0101n. From the first I had said to the kh\u0101n: \u2018Your brothers may be with M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n, (but) God forbid that you should have the thought of going to him and joining them. (68b) Beware, a thousand times beware of thinking of separating yourself from the Emperor.\u2019 Praise be to God! the kh\u0101n kept to what I said.\n\nWhen the Emperor heard that M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n had sent Mahd\u012b Sult\u0101n\u00b3 and Sh\u012br \u2018Al\u012b to fetch Khi\u1e93r Khw\u0101ja Kh\u0101n, he himself despatched Qambar Beg, the son of M\u012brz\u0101 H\u0101j\u012b, to the kh\u0101n, who was then in his own j\u0101g\u012br, and said: \u2018Beware, a thousand times beware! Let there be no joining M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n. Come and wait on me.\u2019 The result of this auspicious message was that the kh\u0101n set out at once for court, and came to the \u2018Uq\u0101bain (Hill of the two eagles) and paid his respects.\n\nWhen the Emperor passed Min\u0101r Hill, M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n sent forward all his well-ordered soldiers under Sh\u012br\n\n\u00b9 Presumably the brick and mud quarters of the ladies.\n\u00b2 Su\u02bf\u016bd na d\u0101rad ki kha\u1e6d-i-mar\u0101 shinasad. I understand that he had not seen her handwriting, and would not know whether a letter purporting to be hers was a forgery. Gul-badan names one son only, Sa\u02bf\u0101dat-y\u0101r, as being her own. She is now about twenty-five.\n\u00b3 Brother of Khi\u1e93r and of Yasin-daulat (\u0100q Sult\u0101n).\nAfkan,\u00b9 the father of Sh\u012broya, so that they might go out and fight. We saw from above\u00b2 how he went out with his drums beating, out beyond B\u0101b\u0101 Dasht\u012b, and we said, \u2018God forbid you should fight,\u2019 and we wept. (69a) When he reached the Afgh\u0101ns\u2019 village (Dih-i-Afgh\u0101n\u0101n), the two vanguards came face to face. The royal advance-guard at once drove off the m\u012brz\u0101\u2019s\u00b3 and, having taken many prisoners, brought them to the Emperor. He ordered the Mughals to be cut to pieces.\u2074 Many of the m\u012brz\u0101\u2019s men who had gone out to fight were captured and some of them were killed and some were kept prisoners. Amongst them was J\u016bk\u012b Kh\u0101n, one of M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s am\u012brs.\n\nIn triumph and glory and to the sound of music, the Emperor entered the \u2018Uq\u0101bain, with M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l in attendance and a splendid cavalcade. He set up for himself tents and pavilions and an audience hall.\u2075 He gave M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l charge of the Mast\u0101n bridge,\u2076 and stationed the am\u012brs one after another. For seven months he kept up the blockade.\u2077 (69b)\n\nIt happened one day that M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n went from his own quarters to the \u2018roof (? of the citadel), and that someone fired a gun from the \u2018Uq\u0101bain. He ran and took himself off. Then he gave this order about the Emperor Akbar: \u2018Bring him and put him in front.\u2019\u2078 Someone let his august Majesty (Hum\u0101y\u016bn) know that M\u012brz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Akbar was being kept on the front, so he forbade the guns to be fired and after that none were aimed at the\n\n\u00b9 Son of Quch Beg, an am\u012br who lost his life in trying to protect Bega Begam at Chausa.\n\u00b2 From the citadel where the ladies were.\n\u00b3 The begam underrates Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s victory. The struggle was fierce, renewed and stubborn.\n\u2074 Doubtful translation.\n\u2075 I think she merely wishes to say that Hum\u0101y\u016bn camped out on the \u2018Uq\u0101bain, and did not take up quarters under a roof.\n\u2076 Under it flows the stream which issues from the defile of Dih-i-ya\u2018q\u016bb.

This person,\u2014who later on became so important,\u2014is nowhere named by the begam as in charge of Akbar. Her husband, Nad\u012bm k\u016bka, is so named.\nB\u0101l\u0101-i-hi\u1e63\u0101r. M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s men used to fire from the town upon the Emperor on the \u2018Uq\u0101bain. The royal soldiers put M\u012brz\u0101 \u2019Askar\u012b to stand right in front and made fun of him.\n\nM\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s men also used to make sallies from the fort, and on both sides many were killed. The royal troops were often the victors and then the others had not courage to come out. For the sake of his wives and children and the begams and the household, etc., the Emperor did not have the cannon fired nor did he place the large houses in difficulty. (70a)\n\nWhen the long siege was ended, they (i.e., the ladies) sent Khw\u0101ja Dost Kh\u0101wand mad\u0101rch\u016b\u00b9 to his Majesty to say: \u2018For God\u2019s sake, do whatever M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n asks, and save the servants of God from molestation.\u2019\u00b2\n\nThe Emperor sent for their use from outside nine sheep, seven flasks of rose-water, one of lemonade, and seven sets of nine dress-lengths\u00b3 and some made-up jackets.\u00b3 He wrote:\u2074 \u2018For their sakes, I could not use force against the citadel, lest I should give an advantage to their enemies.\u2019\u2075\n\nDuring the siege Jah\u0101n Sult\u0101n Begam who was two years old, died. His Majesty wrote: \u2018Some time or other, if we had used force against the citadel, M\u012brz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Akbar would have disappeared.\u2019\n\nTo finish the story: There were always people in the B\u0101l\u0101-i-hi\u1e63\u0101r from evening prayer till dawn, and there was a continuous uproar. The night M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n went away,\u2076 prayer-time passed and indeed bedtime came, and there was no noise at all. (70b)\n\nThere was a steep stair by which people came up from\n\n\u00b9 Follower of the Musalm\u0101n saint Mad\u0101r.\n\u00b2 This message seems one from the imprisoned ladies. The khw\u0101ja to whom it was entrusted may now, as in the earlier siege of K\u0101bul, have been K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s envoy to Hum\u0101yun.\n\u00b3 p\u0101rcha and n\u012bmcha dokhta.

When all the city was asleep, there suddenly sounded (on the stair) a clashing and clinking of armour, so that we said to one another: \u2018What a noise!\u2019 Perhaps a thousand people were standing in front (of the fort). We were afraid, but all at once, without warning, off they went. Qar\u0101cha Kh\u0101n\u2019s son Bah\u0101dur brought us word that the m\u012brz\u0101 had fled.\\(^1\\)\n\nHaving thrown a rope, they (or he) brought up Khw\u0101ja Mu\u2019azzam by way of the wall.\\(^2\\)\n\nOur people and the begam\u2019s people and the rest who were outside, took away the door which had kept us fastened in. Bega Begam urged: \u2018Let us go to our own houses.\u2019 I said: \u2018Have a little patience. We should have to go by the lane and perhaps too someone will come from the Emperor.\u2019 At that moment \u2018Ambar N\u0101zir came and said: \u2018This is the royal order: \u201cThey are not to leave that place till I come.\u201d\u2019 In a little while the Emperor came and embraced Dil-d\u0101r Begam and me, and then Bega Begam and \u1e24amida-b\u0101n\u016b Begam, and said: \u2018Come quickly out of this place. (71a) God preserve His friends from such a house, and let such be the portion of His foes.\u2019 He said to N\u0101zir: \u2018Guard one side,\u2019 and to Tard\u012b Beg Kh\u0101n: \u2018Guard the other, and let the begams pass out.\u2019 All came out, and we spent the evening of that day with the Emperor in perfect content till night became morning. We embraced M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak Begam and Kh\u0101nish \u0101gh\u0101 and those of the \u1e25aram who had been with the Emperor on the campaign.\n\nIn Badakhsh\u0101n M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak had a daughter born. On the same night the Emperor had this dream: \u2018Fakhru-n-nis\u0101\u2019, my m\u0101m\u0101,\\(^3\\) and Daulat-bakht came in by the door,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn Ahmad says that K\u0101mr\u0101n escaped by a hole fashioned for the purpose in the wall \u2018on Khizr Khw\u0101ja\u2019s\u2019 side. This suggests that Gul-badan\u2019s husband connived at the evasion, unless one remembers that Khizr Khw\u0101ja is a place outside K\u0101bul.\n\n\\(^2\\) I do not understand this sentence. Either the followers of K\u0101mr\u0101n drew the khw\u0101ja up into the fort-precincts to take him with them, he having displeased Hum\u0101y\u016bn and being nearly connected with him, or the ladies had him drawn up. He was, it seems, not a prisoner. (67b)\n\n\\(^3\\) Fakhru-n-nis\u0101\u2019, the mother of Nad\u012bm k\u016bka, would seem from this to have been Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s own attendant in childhood.\nand brought something or other, and then left me alone.' Consider it as he might, he could only ask: 'What does this dream mean?' Then it occurred to him that, as a daughter had just been born, he would call her after the two, and taking nis\u0101' from one, and bakht from the other, would run them together into Bakht-nis\u0101'.\n\nM\u0101h-ch\u016bchak had four daughters\u00b9 and two sons,\u2014Bakhtnis\u0101' Begam, and Sak\u012bna-b\u0101n\u016b Begam, and Am\u012bna-b\u0101n\u016b Begam, and Mu\u1e25ammad Hak\u012bm M\u012brz\u0101, and Farrukh-f\u0101l M\u012brz\u0101. (71b) She was with child when the Emperor went to Hind\u016bst\u0101n (1554), and bore a son, in K\u0101bul, whom they named Farrukh-f\u0101l M\u012brz\u0101. A little later Kh\u0101nish \u0101gh\u0101 had a son whom they named Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Sult\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101.\n\nThe Emperor spent a full year and a half in K\u0101bul, prosperously and happily, and in comfort and sociability.\u00b2\n\nAfter taking flight from K\u0101bul, M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n went to Badakhsh\u0101n, and there stayed in T\u0101liq\u0101n. One day the Emperor was in the Inner Garden,\u00b3 and when he rose at dawn for prayers, news came that many of the am\u012brs who formerly were with the m\u012brz\u0101, had gone to him again. Amongst them were Qar\u0101cha Kh\u0101n and Mu\u1e63\u0101\u1e25ib Kh\u0101n, and Mub\u0101riz Kh\u0101n and B\u0101p\u016bs.\u2074 Many wretches fled by night and went to join the m\u012brz\u0101 in Badakhsh\u0101n.\n\nIn a propitious hour the Emperor also started for Badakhsh\u0101n. He besieged the m\u012brz\u0101 in T\u0101liq\u0101n, and after a time made him agree to submit and become obedient (72a) when he waited on the Emperor, who bestowed Kul\u0101b on him, and gave Qila-i-zafar to M\u012brz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n, Qandah\u0101r (sic; (?) Kunduz) to M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l, and T\u0101liq\u0101n to M\u012brz\u0101 'Askar\u012b.\n\n\u00b9 Gul-badan does not name Fakhru-n-nis\u0101' who became the wife of Sh\u0101h 'Ab\u016b'l-ma'\u0101li and of Khw\u0101ja \u1e24asan Naqshband\u012b. Perhaps she is Bakht-nis\u0101'.\n\u00b2 From 1547; but a term of one and a half years does not quite fit the facts. Hum\u0101y\u016bn started for the north on June 12th, 1548. (B & H., II. 352.)\n\u00b3 \u0101rta-b\u0101gh.\n\u2074 Perhaps it may be taken as an indication of the degradation of 'home life' that Qar\u0101cha and B\u0101p\u016bs again joined K\u0101mr\u0101n, although the latter had exposed Qar\u0101cha's son and a wife of B\u0101p\u016bs on the battlements, with the utmost dishonour, and had killed three of the latter's children and flung their bodies from the ramparts.\nOne day at Kishm\u00b9 they had set up\u00b2 the tents and there was an assembly of the brothers, his Majesty the Emperor Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n, and M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Ask\u0101r\u012b, and M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l, and M\u012brz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n.\u00b3\n\nHis Majesty enjoined certain regulations\u2074 which are fixed for interviews with kings, and said: \u2018Bring ewer and basin so that we may wash our hands and eat together.\u2019 He washed his hands and M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n washed his. By years M\u012brz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n (b. 920H.) had precedence of M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Ask\u0101r\u012b (b. 922H.) and M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l (b. 925H.). So, to show him respect, the two brothers set the ewer and basin first before him.\n\nAfter washing his hands M\u012brz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n did something improper with his nose. M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Ask\u0101r\u012b and M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l were much put out, and said: \u2018What rusticity is this? (72b) First of all, what right have we to wash our hands in his Majesty\u2019s presence? but when he bestows the favour and gives the order, we cannot change it. What sense is there in these nose-wagging performances?\u2019 Then the two m\u012brz\u0101s went and washed their hands outside and came back and sat down. M\u012brz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n was very much ashamed. They all ate at one tablecloth.\n\nAt this gathering his Majesty graciously remembered this lowly person, and said to his brothers: \u2018Gul-badan Begam used to say in L\u0101h\u014dr: \u201cI wish I could see all my brothers together!\u201d As we have been seated together since early morning, her words have occurred to my mind. If it be the will of the most high God, may our assembly be kept in His own place! He knows without shadow that it lies not in my heart\u2019s depths to seek any Musalm\u0101n\u2019s ill;\n\n\u00b9 Ab\u016b\u2019l-fa\u017cl says the meeting was at Ishk\u0101mish, and this seems to agree with the movements of Hum\u0101y\u016bn better than Kishm.\n\u00b2 kh\u012brg\u0101 dokhta budand. Certain tents are termed dokhta, sewed. They seem to have been large, and were laced together, whence, perhaps, dokhta.\n\u00b3 \u2018Brother\u2019 by courtesy and custom; anglice, \u2018cousin.\u2019\n\u2074 T\u016br\u0101, the Institutes of Chingiz Kh\u0101n of which the begam makes other mention.\nhow then, should I seek the hurt of my brothers? May God grant to you all the same divine and beneficent guidance, so that our agreement and concord may endure!\u2019 (73a)\n\nThere was wonderful cheerfulness and happiness because many officers and their followers met their relations again, for they too had been sundered because of their masters\u2019 quarrels. Nay! one might rather say they had thirsted for one another\u2019s blood. Now they passed their time in complete happiness.\n\nOn his return from Badakhsh\u0101n the Emperor spent a year and a half in K\u0101bul and then resolved to go to Balkh. He took up his quarters in the Heart-expanding Garden,\u00b9 and his own residence was over against the lower part of the garden, and the begams were in Quli Beg\u2019s house because it was close by.\n\nThe begams said to the Emperor over and over again: \u2018Oh, how the r\u012bw\u0101j\u00b2 will be coming up!\u2019 He replied:\n\n\u00b9 i.e., moved out of the city as a preliminary to marching.\n\u00b2 The following account of this plant is taken from Conolly\u2019s Travels, I., 213 n.. It is translated by him from the Makh\u0101zinu-l-adwiya (Treasury of Medicines). \u2018R\u012bb\u0101s, r\u012bv\u0101s, r\u012bw\u0101j or jigar\u012b (so named from a person of Nish\u0101pur who first discovered it) is a shrub two or three feet high, in appearance like beet (salq). In the middle are one or two short stems of little thickness; the leaves, which separate lengthwise like those of a lettuce, are downy and green, but towards the root, of a violet or whitish colour. The heart is white, delicate, juicy, acidulous and slightly astringent. Altogether the stalk is the size of a man\u2019s arm and when the plant is large every leaf has the size of a man\u2019s hand. Ard-shir was named R\u012bwand-dast (rhubarb-hand) from the length of his hands. The root is called r\u012bwand (rhubarb). The top is like the claw of a fowl. The flower is red, and the taste is subacid with a little sweetness. The seed is formed at the top of a long slender stalk which springs up annually in the centre of the plant. It grows where snow lies and in mountainous countries. The best grows in Persia. It is medicinally attenuating and astringent, gives tone to the stomach, and improves the appetite. A collyrium of the juice strengthens the eye and prevents opacity, and a poultice of it with barley-meal is a useful application to sores and boils. The juice of the r\u012bv\u0101s is harsher than that of unripe grapes.\u2019 For mention of the name r\u012bw\u0101j see Tabaqat-i-akbari, Lucknow lith. ed., 215; T\u016bzuk-i-jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b, 47. Vullers, s.v., etc.. Mr. Erskine writes (Mems., 138 n.) : \u2018It is described as somewhat like beetroot, but much larger, red and white in colour, with large leaves that rise little from the ground. It is a pleasant mixture of sweet and acid. It may be the rhubarb, r\u0101wand.\u2019\n'When I join the army, I shall travel by the Koh-d\u0101man, so that you may come out and see the riw\u0101j growing.' It was at afternoon prayer-time that he rode out\\(^1\\) (of K\u0101bul) to the garden. Qul\u012b Beg's house where the begams were, was close by and overlooked it, and his Majesty pulled up as he passed, and all the begams saw him, and rose and made the k\u014drnish.\\(^2\\) (73b) Directly they had made this salutation, he beckoned with his own blessed hand, to say: 'Come.'\n\nFakhru-n-nis\u0101\u02be m\u0101m\u0101 and Afgh\u0101n\u012b \u0101gh\u0101cha went on a little ahead. There was a stream in the lower part of the garden which Afgh\u0101n\u012b \u0101gh\u0101cha could not cross, and she fell off her horse. For this reason there was an hour's delay.\\(^3\\) At last we set out with his Majesty. M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak Begam not knowing, her horse went up a little.\\(^4\\) His Majesty was very much annoyed about this. The garden was on a height and the walls were not yet made. Some vexation now showed itself in his blessed countenance and he was pleased to say: 'All of you go on, and I will follow when I have taken some opium and got over my annoyance.' He joined us when we had, as he ordered, gone on a little. The look of vexation was entirely laid aside and he came with a happy and beautiful look in his face.\n\nIt was a moonlight night.\\(^5\\) We talked and told stories,\\(^6\\) and M\u012br (fault) and Kh\u0101nish \u0101gh\u0101cha and \u0179ar\u012bf the reciter and Sar\u016b-sah\u012b and Sh\u0101ham \u0101gh\u0101 sang softly, softly.\n\nUp to the time of our reaching Laghm\u0101n, neither the\n\n---\n\n1 Presumably from K\u0101bul, and on the day of starting for Balkh via the Koh-d\u0101man.\n2 The ladies seem to have been waiting for this signal to start.\n3 Probably to allow for the coming of a less unpropitious hour. This expedition to Balkh ended in a way calculated to attract notice to ill-omens such as the begam's misadventures would seem.\n4 andak buland raft. Perhaps the horse reared, the begam not knowing how to manage it; but the later and otherwise irrelevant sentence about the unfinished wall suggests that the begam went too high up the hill. The party is now on its way to see the riw\u0101j growing, and Hun\u016by\u016bn's temper is tried by the various contretemps of the ladies' cavalcade.\n5 A folio of the MS. is, I believe, misplaced, and folio 83 should come in here. In the MS. volume this is the last folio.\nroyal tents nor the pavilions of the begams had arrived, but the mihr-amez\\(^1\\) tent had come. We all, his Majesty and all of us, and \u1e24amida-b\u0101n\u016b Begam sat in that tent till three hours past midnight and then we went to sleep where we were, in company with that altar of truth (Hum\u0101y\u016bn).\n\nEarly next morning he wished to go and see the r\u012bw\u0101j on the K\u014dh. The begams\u2019 horses were in the village, so the starting-time passed before they came up. The Emperor ordered that the horses of everyone who was outside should be brought. When they came he gave the order: \u2018Mount.\u2019\n\nBega Begam and M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak Begam were still putting on their head-to-foot dresses, and I said to the Emperor: \u2018If you think well, I will go and fetch them.\u2019 \u2018Go,\u2019 he answered, \u2018and bring them quickly.\u2019 I said to the begams and to M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak Begam and the rest of the ladies: \u2018I have become the slave of his Majesty\u2019s wishes. What trouble waiting gives!\u2019 I was gathering them all together and bringing them when he came to meet me and said: \u2018Gul-badan! the proper hour for starting has gone by.(ssb) It would be hot the whole way. God willing, we will go after offering the afternoon prayer.\u2019 He seated himself in a tent with \u1e24amida-b\u0101n\u016b Begam.\\(^2\\) After afternoon prayers, there was the interval between two prayers before the horses arrived. In this interval he went away.\\(^3\\)\n\nEverywhere in the D\u0101man-i-k\u014dh the r\u012bw\u0101j had put up its leaves. We went to the skirts of the hills and when it was evening, we walked about. Tents and pavilions were pitched on the spot and there his Majesty came and stayed. Here too we passed the nights together in sociable talk, and were all in company of that altar of truth.\n\nIn the morning at prayer-time, he went away to a\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Perhaps a tent of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s invention, in the name of which mihr means sun. Cf. \u2018another of his (Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s) inventions was a tent which had twelve divisions, corresponding to the signs of the Zodiac. Every sign had a lattice through which the lights of the stars of dominion shone.\u2019 (Akbar-n\u0101ma, H. Beveridge I. 361.)\n\n\\(^2\\) Perhaps, a tent of \u1e24amida having come, he seated himself in it.\n\n\\(^3\\) (?) the start was made to see the r\u012bw\u0101j.\ndistance (b\u016br\u016bn), and from there wrote separate letters to Bega Begam and to \u1e24am\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b Begam and to M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak Begam and to me and to all the begams,\\(^1\\) saying: \u2018Becoming spokeswoman of your own fault, write apologizing for the trouble you have given. God willing, I shall say farewell and go to join the army either at Far\u1e93a or Ist\u0101l\u012bf, and if not we shall travel apart.\u2019\\(^{74a}\\)\n\nThen everyone wrote to apologize for having given trouble, and sent the letter for his holy and elevating service.\n\nIn the end his Majesty and all the begams mounted and rode by Lamgh\u0101n to Bihz\u0101d\u012b. At night each one went to her own quarters, and in the morning they ate (? alone), and at mid-day prayer-time rode to Far\u1e93a.\n\n\u1e24am\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b Begam sent nine sheep to the quarters of each one of us. Bib\u012b Daulat-bakht had come one day earlier to Far\u1e93a and had got ready plenty of provisions and milk and curds and syrup and sherbet and so on. We spent that evening in amusement. In the early morning (we went) above Far\u1e93a to where there is a beautiful waterfall. Then his Majesty went to Ist\u0101l\u012bf and passed three days, and then in 958H.\\(^2\\) marched towards Balkh.\n\nWhen he crossed the pass, he sent farm\u0101ns to summon M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n and M\u012brz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n and M\u012brz\u0101 \u02bfAskar\u012b, and said: \u2018We are on the march to fight the Uzbegs; now is the time for union and brotherliness. You ought to come as quickly as possible.\u2019 M\u012brz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n and M\u012brz\u0101 \u02bfAskar\u012b came and joined him.\\(^{74b}\\) Then march by march they came to Balkh.\n\nIn Balkh was P\u012br Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n,\\(^3\\) and on the first\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s comprehensive displeasure looks like a fit of temper directed against every and any one. It is possible, however, that a page which might describe other untoward matters besides unpunctuality, has been altogether lost. The sentence which now continues the story, places all the ladies, deprived of their evening of talk and amusement, in chastened solitude.\n\n\\(^2\\) B. & H., II. 368, has 956H.

By the next morning the kh\u0101n had come to think: \u2018The Chaghat\u0101\u012b are strong; I cannot fight them. It would be better to get out and away.\u2019 Just then the royal officers joined in representing that the camp had become filthy, and that it would be well to move to a desert place (dasht). His Majesty ordered them to do so.\n\nNo sooner were hands laid on the baggage and pack-saddles, than others raised a clamour and some cried out: \u2018We are not strong enough.\u2019 Since such was the Divine will, the royal army took the road without cause from a foe, without reason or motive.\\(^1\\) The news of their march reached the Uzbegs and amazed them. Try as the royal officers would, they produced not a scrap of effect. It could not be hindered: the royal army ran away. \\((75a)\\)\n\nThe Emperor waited a little, and when he saw that no one was left, he too had to go. M\u012brz\u0101 \u0100skar\u012b and M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l, not having heard of the confusion, rode up to the camp. They found no one and saw that the Uzbegs had gone in pursuit, so they too took the road and made for Kunduz. After riding a little way, his Majesty stopped and said: \u2018My brothers are not here yet: how can I go on?\u2019 He asked the officers and attendants whether anyone would bring him news of the princes. No one answered or went. Later on word came from the M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s people in Kunduz that they had heard of the disaster and did not know where the princes had gone. This letter upset the Emperor very much. Khizr Khw\u0101ja Kh\u0101n said: \u2018If you approve, I will bring news.\u2019 \u2018God\u2019s mercy on you!\u2019 rejoined his Majesty. \u2018May they have gone to Kunduz!\u2019 \\((75b)\\)\n\nTwo days afterwards the khw\u0101ja, to the Emperor\u2019s great\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) From other sources we learn that the royalists were anxious on two grounds; (1) as to the threatened arrival of an overwhelming Uzbeg force from Bukh\u0101r\u0101, and (2) lest K\u0101mr\u0101n should again take K\u0101bul and have their families at his mercy. The last was perhaps the dominant motive for the flight without a pursuer.\ndelight, brought word that M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l had arrived at Kunduz safe and sound. His Majesty gave M\u012brz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n leave to go to his own place, Qila-i-zafar, and came himself to K\u0101bul (1550, 957H.).\n\nWhile M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n was in K\u016bl\u0101b, a woman named Tarkh\u0101n\u00b9 Bega, who was a thorough cheat, showed him the way by saying: \u2018Make a declaration of love to Haram Begam.\u2019\u00b2 Good will come of it.\u2019 Acting on these words of an ill-judging adviser, he actually sent a letter and a kerchief\u00b3 to Haram Begam by the hand of Beg\u012b \u0101gh\u0101. This woman laid the letter and the kerchief before the begam and then set forth the m\u012brz\u0101\u2019s devotion and passion. Haram Begam said: \u2018Keep that letter and that kerchief now and bring them again when the m\u012brz\u0101s come home.\u2019 Beg\u012b \u0101gh\u0101 then wept, and moaned, and coaxed, and said: \u2018M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n has sent you this letter and this kerchief; he has loved you a long time, and you have no pity for him.\u2019 (76a) Haram Begam began to show her disgust and violent anger, and at once sent off for her husband, M\u012brz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n, and her son, M\u012brz\u0101 Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. She said to them: \u2018M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n must have come to think you are cowards, since he sends me a letter like this. Have I deserved to be written to in this way? He is as your elder brother, and I am to him as a younger brother\u2019s wife.\u2074 Send off a letter for me about it and rebuke him. As for this wretch of a woman, tear her piece by piece. Let her be a warning to others that no man may cast the evil eye of sinful thought upon another man\u2019s womanfolk. What does such a man deserve who, the son of a mother, yet does such monstrous things, and who fears neither me\u2075 nor my son?\u2019\n\n\u00b9 This title indicates rank. A \u2018Tarkh\u0101n Begam\u2019 was wife of Sult\u0101n Ahmad M\u012brz\u0101. (Mems., 22.)\n\u00b2 or Khurr\u0101m. One of her sisters was a wife of K\u0101mr\u0101n.\n\u00b3 What fascination may lurk in an embroidered kerchief can be guessed by inspecting the dainty examples in the South Kensington Oriental Section.\n\u2074 kilin. Both here and at 77b this word seems to have wider meaning than is given by the Turk\u012b and Persian dictionaries.\n\u2075 The begam\u2019s martial character spices this story, since her husband\nInstantly hands were laid on Beg\u012b \u0101gh\u0101 B\u012bb\u012b, condemned of fate to die, and she was torn in pieces. In consequence of this affair, M\u012brz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n and M\u012brz\u0101 Ibr\u0101h\u012bm were displeased with M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n, or rather they became his enemies. (76b) They wrote to the Emperor that M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n wished to thwart him and that this could not be better seen than in his failure to go to Balkh with him.\n\nAfter this the m\u012brz\u0101, in K\u016bl\u0101b,\u00b9 could not find, in his terror-stricken thoughts, any better remedy than to become a darvish. He sent his son, Ab\u016b\u2019l-q\u0101sim (Ibr\u0101h\u012bm) to M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Askar\u012b, and betook himself to T\u0101liq\u0101n with his daughter \u2018\u0100yisha (Sult\u0101n Begam), and said to his wife (Mu\u1e25tarima Kh\u0101nam): \u2018Do you and your daughter follow me later. I will send for you to whatever place I settle on. Till then go and stay in Khost and Andar-\u0101b.\u2019 The kh\u0101nam was related to the Uzbeg kh\u0101ns, and some of her kinsfolk let the Uzbegs\u00b2 know: \u2018If you want booty, there are goods and men and women servants; take these, and let the lady go free, for if \u2018\u0100yisha Sult\u0101n Kh\u0101nam\u2019s\u00b3 nephew hears to-morrow (that she has been hurt), he will certainly be very angry with you.\u2019 By a hundred plans and wiles, and with a hundred anxieties, and without her goods, she got free from the Uzbeg bondage, and reached Khost and Andar-\u0101b. Here she stayed.\n\nWhen M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n heard of the royal disaster in Balkh, he said: \u2018The Emperor is not so friendly to me as he was.\u2019 (77a) So he left K\u016bl\u0101b, and went hither and thither.\n\nAt this time (1550) his Majesty came out from K\u0101bul. When he reached the Qibch\u0101q defile, he incautiously halted in a low-lying place, and M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n, coming from higher ground, armed and equipped, poured down foes upon him.\n\n\u00b9 In K\u016bl\u0101b were the kinsfolk of his wife, M\u0101h Begam, sister of Haram Begam, daughter of Sult\u0101n Wais Qibch\u0101q, and sister of Chakr \u2018Al\u012b Kh\u0101n.\n\u00b2 i.e., across whose country she had to travel.\n\u00b3 (?) Mughal Kh\u0101nam.\nSince such was the Divine will, a barbarian,\u2014inwardly blind, an ill-fated oppressor and ill-omened tyrant,\u2014inflicted a wound on the Emperor. The blow reached his blessed head, and all his forehead and his dear eyes were stained with blood.\n\nIt was just like it was in the Mughal war when the blessed head of his Majesty Firdaus-makan\u012b, the Emperor B\u0101bar, was wounded by a Mughal, and his high cap and the turban wrapped round it were not cut, but his blessed head was badly hurt. His Majesty Hum\u0101y\u016bn used to say with surprise: \u2018I wondered at it, for cap and cloth were whole, and yet the head was cut.\u2019\u00b9 The very same thing happened now to his own head.\n\nAfter the rout in the Qibch\u0101q defile, his Majesty went to Badakhsh\u0101n, and M\u012brz\u0101 Hindal, and M\u012brz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n, and M\u012brz\u0101 Ibr\u0101h\u012bm came and waited on him. (77b) He went\u00b2 to K\u0101bul and the m\u012brz\u0101s were in attendance, friendly and united and at peace together, when M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n approached. His Majesty sent a message to \u1e24aram Begam: \u2018Ask my k\u016blin\u00b3 to send me the army of Badakhsh\u0101n as quickly as possible and ready for service.\u2019 In a few days, \u2014a very short time,\u2014the begam had given horses and arms to some thousands of men. She herself superintended and took thought and she came with the troops as far as the pass. From here she sent them forward, and while she went back they went on and joined the Emperor.\n\n\u00b9 \u2018Tambol let fall a heavy sword-blow on my head. It is a singular fact that, though not a thread of my cap of mail was injured, yet my head was severely wounded.\u2019 (Mems., 266. Also 111.)\n\n\u00b2 N\u012bz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn Al\u012bmad, \u2018after forty days.\n\n\u00b3 Cf. 77a n.. This story bears out \u1e24aram\u2019s military reputation. K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s power of attraction and Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s present risk can be gauged by the fact that even after the defeat at Ch\u0101rik\u0101r\u0101n some 1,500 horse were with the former, and many amirs again went over to him.\n\nIt was now that the remarkable compact which effected K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s downfall was made between Hum\u0101y\u016bn and his amirs. (B. & H., II. 338.) These swore fidelity by whatever oath would bind them and then, at the instance of \u1e24\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n k\u016bka, Hum\u0101y\u016bn bound himself to,\u2014do as he was told. The compact was effective. The amirs were the long-suffering victims of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s folly and their present turning was, he admitted, justifiable.\nEither at Ch\u0101r\u012bk\u0101r\u0101n or Qar\u0101-b\u0101gh there was fighting with M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n and his Majesty\u2019s army was successful. The m\u012brz\u0101 fled to the mountain passes (tangayh\u0101) and Lamgh\u0101n\u0101t.\\(^1\\)\n\n\u0100q Sult\u0101n (Yas\u012bn-daulat) who was the m\u012brz\u0101\u2019s son-in-law, said in effect to him (gufta b\u0101shad): \u2018You are continually thwarting the Emperor. What is the meaning of it? It is not what should be. (78a) Either make your submission and obeisance to the Emperor or give me leave to go, so that men may distinguish between us.\u2019 M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n said fiercely: \u2018Have my affairs come to such a pass that you offer me advice?\u2019 \u0100q Sult\u0101n also spoke angrily, \u2018If I stay with you, my position will be unlawful,\u2019 and left him at once, and went with his wife (\u1e24ab\u012bba) to Bhakkar. The m\u012brz\u0101 wrote to M\u012brz\u0101 Sh\u0101h Husain, and said: \u2018\u0100q Sult\u0101n has displeased me and has gone away. If he comes to Bhakkar, do not let his wife be with him. Part them and tell him to go where he likes.\u2019 Sh\u0101h Husain M\u012brz\u0101 at once, on receiving the letter, deprived \u1e24ab\u012bba Sult\u0101n Begam of the company of \u0100q Sult\u0101n and let him depart for the blessed Makka.\\(^2\\)\n\nIn the fight at Ch\u0101r\u012bk\u0101r\u0101n, Qar\u0101cha Kh\u0101n\\(^3\\) and many of M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s well-known officers were killed.\n\n\u2018\u0100yisha Sult\u0101n Begam\\(^4\\) and Daulat-bakht agh\u0101cha were in flight for Qandah\u0101r, and were captured at the Khimar Pass, and brought in by the Emperor\u2019s people. M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n went to the Afgh\u0101ns,\\(^5\\) and stayed amongst them. (78b)\n\nFrom time to time his Majesty used to visit the orange-gardens. That year also, according to his old habit, he went to the mountain passes (tangayh\u0101) to see the oranges. M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l was in attendance, and of the ladies (haram\u0101n),\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn Ahmad, \u2018mountains of Mandr\u016bd.\u2019 B. & H., II. 393, \u2018by the Pass of B\u0101dpaj towards the Afgh\u0101n country.\u2019\n\n\\(^2\\) K\u0101mr\u0101n was the son-in-law of Mir Sh\u0101h Husain Argh\u016bn, and was therefore able to secure this interference with \u0100q Sult\u0101n\u2019s domestic affairs.\n\n\\(^3\\) Cf.

I could not go because my son, Sa'adat-yar, was ill at the time. One day his Majesty, attended by Mirza Hindal, was hunting near the mountain passes. They had very good sport. The Emperor went towards where the mirza was hunting and had made a very good bag. Following the rules of Chingiz Khan, the mirza proffered his game to the Emperor, for it is a rule of Chingiz Khan that inferiors should so act towards their superiors. In short, he gave the Emperor all his game. Then it occurred to him: 'There is still my sisters' portion. (79a) They shall not complain again. I will hunt once more and get them a share.' Again he busied himself in hunting, and had taken one head of game, and was returning, when someone sent by Mirza Kamaran blocked the road, and shot an arrow at the unwitting mirza which struck his blessed shoulder. Acting on the thought 'God forbid my sisters and womenfolk should be upset by news of this,' he wrote off at once to say: 'Ill begun has ended well! Do not be anxious, for I am getting better.' To finish the story: as it was hot, his Majesty went back to Kabul, and in the course of a year the arrow-wound got better.\n\nA year later word was brought that Mirza Kamaran had collected troops and was preparing for war. His Majesty also, taking military appurtenances, set out for the mountain passes (tangayha) with Mirza Hindal. He went safe and well, and made his honouring halt in the passes. Hour by hour, and all the time, spies kept bringing news: 'Mirza Kamaran has decided that an attack must be made to-night.' (79b) Mirza Hindal went to the Emperor and submitted his advice: 'Let your Majesty stay on this high ground, and let my brother (nephew) Jalalu-d-din Muhammad Akbar padshah stay with you, so that careful watch may be kept on this height.' Then he called up his own men, and encouraged and cheered them one by one, and said: 'Put\n\n1 Repetition of a proverb already quoted.\nearlier services in one scale and the service of this night in the other.

So there was a delay.\u2019 (80a)\n\nThe m\u012brz\u0101 replied: \u2018You were wrong. (You should have) said rather: \u201cMay there be a blessed martyrdom.\u201d\u2019 Then he went on: \u2018Friends all! be my witness that I abjure all forbidden things and all indecorous acts.\u2019 Those present recited the f\u0101thiha and prayed: \u2018May there be benediction.\u2019 He said: \u2018Bring my vest and cuirass and surtout.\u2019 He put them on and went out to the trenches to encourage and solace his men. Just then his \u1e63abaqch\u012b,\\(^4\\) hearing his voice, cried: \u2018They are attacking me.\u2019 The m\u012brz\u0101, hearing this, dismounted and said: \u2018Friends, it is far from brave to give no help when my servant is at the point of the sword.\u2019 He himself went down into the trench but not one of his followers dismounted.

He mentions her again, with others of the m\u012brz\u0101\u2019s widows, as seen in Har\u0101t in 912H. (1506-7), and here his wording, both in the Turk\u012b and the Persian texts, allows the inference that she is a daughter of Sult\u0101n Ab\u016b-sa\u02bfid M\u012br\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b. Mr. Erskine translates the passage thus: \u2018P\u0101yanda Sult\u0101n Begam, my father\u2019s sister, Khadija Begam and the other (Turk\u012b, yena; Pers., d\u012bgar) daughters of Sult\u0101n Ab\u016b-sa\u02bfid M\u012brz\u0101.\u2019\n\nWhen greeting the ladies, B\u0101bar gave \u0100f\u0101q precedence over Khadija, and notes the fact. Khadija was not a woman of birth.\n\n\u1e24usain B\u0101yqr\u0101 married three daughters of Ab\u016b-sa\u02bfid, Shahr-b\u0101n\u016b, P\u0101yanda, and \u0100f\u0101q. The last bore him no child, but she reared and educated nine children of his by her own foster-sister, B\u0101b\u0101 agh\u0101cha.\n\nEarly in 932H. (1525) she went from Har\u0101t to K\u0101bul and was received by B\u0101bar (before his departure for India in November, 1525) with all possible respect and kindness. He gives the impression that\n\n\u00b9 This Appendix makes no pretence at completeness. It contains the gatherings in of work on Gul-badan Begam\u2019s Hum\u0101y\u016bn-n\u0101ma.\nshe was an affectionate and devoted woman, and says that her tender care of her husband in illness surpassed that of all the other ladies of the *haram*.\n\nNews of her death reached B\u0101bar when he was besieging Chand\u012br\u012b in 934H. (January, 1528).\n\nMems., 182, 183, 204.\n\nII. \u0100f\u0101q Begam. (No. 26.)\u00b9\n\nShe was a daughter of Sult\u0101n-bakht Begam; her father's name has not yet come to my knowledge; she was a grand-daughter of Sult\u0101n Ab\u016b-sa\u02bf\u012bd M\u012brz\u0101.\n\nB\u0101bar mentions the arrival of a daughter of Sult\u0101n-bakht Begam in \u0100gra in 935H. (October, 1528), and Gul-badan supplies the name \u0100f\u0101q by naming an \u0100f\u0101q of this parentage as at the Mystic Feast in 938H. (1531).\n\nGul-badan.

She may be *B\u0101yqr\u0101* (*infra*).\n\nGul-badan, 25b.\n\n\u00b9 Numbers so entered are those of Gul-badan's guest-list, 24b et seq..\nV. \u0100gh\u0101 Begam B\u0101yqra.\n\nShe was a daughter of Sult\u0101n Husain M\u012brz\u0101 B\u0101yqra and of P\u0101yanda Sult\u0101n Begam M\u012br\u0101n-shah\u016b. Her descent being so high through both parents, her name \u0100gh\u0101 rises above its frequent application to wives of less degree. Here it may have the meaning of chief or great. She married her cousin Mur\u0101d who was a son of R\u0101b\u012b'a-sult\u0101n Begam (Bedka). The \u1e24ab\u012bbu-s-siy\u0101r, 327 et seq. (lith. ed.), states that she died before she reached maturity, but this does not agree with B\u0101bar's statements. The \u1e24ab\u012bb places her death earlier than 912H. (1506).\n\nMems., 181.\n\u1e24ab\u012bbu-s-siy\u0101r, lith. ed., 327 et seq..\n\nVI. \u0100gh\u0101 k\u016bka.

She was present at Hindal's marriage feast (1537), and probably at the Mystic Feast, in 1531. She is classed amongst 'our begams.'\n\nGul-badan, 25b.\nMems., 10, 14.\n\nVIII. \u0100gh\u0101-sult\u0101n Sultanam Dughl\u0101t.\n\nShe was a daughter of Mu\u1e25ammad Haidar M\u012brz\u0101 Dughl\u0101t, and therefore aunt of the author of the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-rash\u012bd\u016b. She married 'Abdu-l-qad\u016bs Beg Dughl\u0101t in K\u0101shghar, after 877H. (1472-73). Her husband was alive in 900H. (1494-95), and was governor of Khost for Sult\u0101n Ma\u1e25m\u016bd M\u012brz\u0101 M\u012br\u0101n-shah\u016b.\n\nMems., 27.\nT\u0101r.

Her name is not mentioned in the Memoirs, but is so by Ilminsky (Mems., 90; Ilminsky, 34, line 7 from foot).\n\nShe was the fourth daughter of Sult\u0101n Ma\u1e25m\u016bd M\u012brz\u0101 M\u012br\u0101nsh\u0101h\u012b and Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Termiz\u012b II.; and wife of Jah\u0101ng\u012br M\u012brz\u0101, half-brother of B\u0101bar. She was betrothed in 901H. (1495-96), married in 910H. (1504-5), bore one daughter, and was widowed not later than 914H. (1508-9).\n\nMems., 30, 128.\nPavet de Courteille, I. 57, 262.\n\nX. \u0100ka Begam B\u0101yqr\u0101.\n\n\u0100ka is clearly a title; her personal name I have not found. Her sister who is styled Bedka, appears to be named R\u0101bi\u2019a-sult\u0101n.\n\nDaughter of Mans\u016br M\u012brz\u0101 B\u0101yqr\u0101 and Firoza Begam M\u012br\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b, full and elder sister of Sult\u0101n \u1e24usain M\u012brz\u0101. B\u0101bar states (Mems., 176, 177) that she married (his uncle) Sult\u0101n Ahmad M\u012brz\u0101, and had a son, K\u012bchak M\u012brz\u0101 (the young or small prince). But he does not mention her, either as \u0100ka or otherwise, amongst Ahmad\u2019s wives (Mems., 22), and he says that Ahmad had two sons who died young. K\u012bchak, however, lived to change his military occupations for literature.\n\nIt is singular that a marriage of the oldest M\u012br\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b of his generation with the oldest B\u0101yqr\u0101 girl should not have been entered in Ahmad\u2019s biographical notice.\n\nMems., 22, 23, 176, 177.\n\n(\u0100l\u016bsh\u2014An\u016bsh\u2014Begam, \u00dcl\u016bs, q.v..)\n\nXI.

The word is frequently a sobriquet and the bearer's personal name is occasionally known; e.g., Yas\u012bn-daulat, \u0100q Sult\u0101n; Sal\u012bqa Begam, \u0100q Begam. But frequently the personal name is not traceable.\n\nDaughter of Sult\u0101n \u1e24usain M\u012brz\u0101 B\u0101yqr\u0101 and P\u0101yanda Sult\u0101n Begam M\u012br\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b; first cousin of B\u0101bar; wife of Mu\u1e25ammad Q\u0101sim Arl\u0101t. She had one daughter, known as the Black-eyed (qar\u0101-g\u016bz) Begam.\n\nMems., 181.\n\nXIII. \u0100q Begam M\u012br\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b. (No. 3.)\n\n\u0100q Begam was a daughter of Ab\u016b-sa\u02bf\u012bd M\u012br\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b and Khadija. She was one of the several paternal aunts of B\u0101bar who went to India at his invitation. She reached \u0100gra in October, 1528 (\u1e62afar, 935H.), and was met by her nephew. She was present at the double wedding of Gul-rang and Gul-chihra in 1530 (937H.), and was probably at B\u0101bar\u2019s death-bed. She was at the Mystic Feast on December 19th, 1531 (Jum\u0101da I. 9th, 938H.).\n\nGul-badan, 11a, 18b, 20a, 24b.\nMems., 179, 182, 387.\n\nXIV. \u0100q Begam M\u012br\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b.\n\nThird daughter of Sult\u0101n Ma\u1e25m\u016bd M\u012brz\u0101 M\u012br\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b and Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam Termi\u1e93\u012b; and first cousin of B\u0101bar. The Memoirs do not mention her marriage or (as usual alternative) early death. She was full sister of a wife of B\u0101bar, Zainab.\n\nMems., 30.\n\n(Aq Begam, Sal\u012bqa, q.v.)\n\n---\n\n1 Mu\u1e25ammad Q\u0101sim was a T\u012bm\u016brid through his grandmother, Bega Begam, the sister of 'Abdu-l-q\u0101sim B\u0101bar qalandar, King of Khur\u0101s\u0101n (died 1457).\nXV. 'Aq\u012bqa ('Afifa) Begam Mir\u0101n-shah\u012b. (No. 47.)\n\nHer name may be 'Aq\u012bqa, a cornelian, etc., or 'Afifa, a chaste, modest woman. Our begam's MS. allows both readings. I have used the first but the second seems the more appropriate in sense.\n\nShe was a daughter of Hum\u0101y\u016bn and Bega and second child of both parents. She was born in \u0100gra in 1531. It is only from her aunt Gul-badan that anything is known of her. She went to Gu\u0101li\u0101r with her mother in (?) 1534; she was at Hind\u0101l's feast in 1537, and she was lost at Chausa on June 27th, 1539.\n\nGul-badan, 22a, 23b, 25, 33b, 34b.\n\nXVI. \u0100t\u016bn m\u0101m\u0101. (No. 38.)\n\nAn \u0101t\u016bn is a teacher of reading, writing, and embroidery, etc. M\u0101m\u0101 seems to be the title of old women-servants.\n\nB\u0101bar mentions an \u0101t\u016bn in 1501. He met her at Pash\u0101ghar whither she had come on foot from Samarqand and where she again joined her old mistress, B\u0101bar's mother, Qutluq-nigar Kh\u0101nam. She had been left behind in the city after Shaib\u0101n\u012b's capture of it because there was no horse for her to ride.\n\nGul-badan mentions an \u0101t\u016bn m\u0101m\u0101 as at Hind\u0101l's wedding feast, and as m\u0101m\u0101 seems to be used for old servants, it is possible that she is the woman mentioned by B\u0101bar.\n\nGul-badan, 26a.\n\nMems., 99.\n\nXVII. '\u0100yisha-sult\u0101n Begam B\u0101yqr\u0101. (No. 9.)\n\nAr. 'aish, joy, and sult\u0101n, sway, pre-eminence. Cf. App. s.n. Daulat.\n\nDaughter of Sult\u0101n Husain Mirz\u0101 B\u0101yqr\u0101 and Zobaida agh\u0101cha of the Shaib\u0101n sult\u0101ns. '\u0100yisha married, (1) Q\u0101sim Sult\u0101n Uzbeg, a Shaib\u0101n sult\u0101n, and by him became the mother of Q\u0101sim Husain Sultan Uzbeg, an amir of B\u0101bar and Hum\u0101y\u016bn; (2) by yanga-lik (cf. App. s.n. J\u0101mal), B\u016bran Sult\u0101n,\na kinsman of Q\u0101sim Sult\u0101n, and by whom she had \u2018Abdu-l-l\u0101h Sult\u0101n Uzbeg who entered B\u0101bar\u2019s service.\n\n\u0100yisha was at the Mystic Feast in 1531, and she was lost at Chausa in 1539 (946H.).\n\nKhw\u0101nd-am\u012br gives 929H. (1522-23) as a date at which \u0100yisha was in Q\u0101sim Sult\u0101n\u2019s haram, but this does not agree with B\u0101bar\u2019s narrative. His entry that \u2018Abdu-l-l\u0101h was in his service and although young, acquitting himself respectably, cannot at latest have been made after 1530. From 1522 to 1530 is all too short for widowhood, remarriage, birth of \u2018Abdu-l-l\u0101h, and his growth to respectable military service.\n\nGul-badan, 24b, 33b.\nMems., 182.\n\u1e24ab\u012bbu-s-siy\u0101r, lith. ed., 327 et seq..\n\nXVIII. \u0100yisha-sult\u0101n Begam Mir\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b. (? No. 11.)\n\nThird daughter of Sult\u0101n A\u1e25mad M\u012brz\u0101 Mir\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b and Q\u016bt\u016bq (Katak) Begam. She was a first cousin of B\u0101bar, and his first wife. They were betrothed in Samarqand when he was five years old, 894H.(1488-89), and married in Sha\u2019b\u0101n, 905H. (March, 1500), at Khojand during the \u2018troubles\u2019 i.e., conflict with Khusrau Sh\u0101h and A\u1e25mad Tambol. B\u0101bar says that at first he had no small affection for \u0100yisha and that it declined. She was the mother of his first child, Fakhru-n-nis\u0101\u02be (born 907H., 1501). She left B\u0101bar before the overthrow (wir\u0101n\u012b) of T\u0101shkand by Shaib\u0101n\u012b in 909H. (1503), being influenced by the \u2018machinations\u2019 of her elder sister, probably S\u0101liqa, who was married to one of those many kinsmen who tried to overthrow the boy-king of Fargh\u0101na.\n\nGul-badan mentions an \u0100yisha Sult\u0101n Begam (No. 11) as being at the Mystic Feast, without describing her. The following entry (No. 12) is that of Sult\u0101n\u012b, a daughter of Sult\u0101n A\u1e25mad M\u012brz\u0101, and described as being such. It seems likely that Gul-\nb\u0101dan meant this note as to parentage to apply to both begams (Nos. 11 and 12). (Cf. App. s.n. Sul\u1e6d\u0101nan.)\n\nGul-b\u0101dan, 6b, 24b.\nMems., 22, 78, 90.\n\nXIX. \u0100yisha-sul\u1e6d\u0101n Begam M\u012br\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b.\n\nDaughter of K\u0101mr\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101.\n\nF\u012brishta (lith. ed., 241) and Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n (I. 122) say that K\u0101mr\u0101n left one son and three daughters.\n\nThe son is called Ibr\u0101h\u012bm by Gul-b\u0101dan, and in the early part of the Akbar-n\u0101ma. (Bib. Ind., ed., I. 226.) Later the A. N. and other sources call him Ab\u016b'l-q\u0101sim, which may be a hyronymic (kunyat).\n\nAs to the three girls, F\u012brishta, without naming them, gives the information that:\n\nNo. 1 married (a) Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Husain M\u012brz\u0101 (B\u0101yq\u0101).\nNo. 2 ,, (b) M\u012brz\u0101 'Abdu-r-rahman Mughal.\nNo. 3 ,, (c) Fakhru-d-d\u012bn Mashhad\u012b who died in 986H. or 987H. (No. 88 of Blochmann's list. \u0100in-i-akbar\u012b, p. 406).\n\nKh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n's information coincides with F\u012brishta's verbally as to No. 3, and actually as to No. 1 and No. 2. For Ibr\u0101h\u012bm can be described as a son of a 'paternal uncle,' if these words are used in the wide sense given to them by contemporary writers. So, too, can 'Abdu-r-rahman, if he be No. 183 of Blochmann's list\u2014a Dughl\u0101t Mughal and cousin of M\u012brz\u0101 Haidar.\n\nIf we take the girls' names from other sources we can (conjecturally in part) fill up the table.\n\n1. Gul-rukh is known in history as the wife of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Husain M\u012brz\u0101 B\u0101yq\u0101.\n\n2. K\u0101mr\u0101n's eldest daughter, \u1e24ab\u012bba, was forcibly parted from her husband, \u0100q Sul\u1e6d\u0101n, in about 1551-52, and this would allow re-marriage to (b) or (c). \u0100q Sul\u1e6d\u0101n went to Makka from Sind 1551-52 (cir.), and his name disappears thenceforth.\n\n3. \u0100yisha may also have married (b) or (c).\n\nIn the list of the pilgrims of 983H. (A. N. Bib. Ind.-\ned., III. 145) are included 'H\u0101j\u012b and Gul-'iz\u0101r, farzand\u0101n of M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n.' We have already the three names required by Firishta and Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n, i.e., Gul-rukh, \u1e24ab\u012bba and '\u0100yisha. Gul-'iz\u0101r is 'superfluous.' Perhaps farzand\u0101n may be read 'offspring,' and she may be a granddaughter. Or \u1e24ab\u012bba or '\u0100yisha may have predeceased K\u0101mr\u0101n, and for this reason three girls only be specified by historians who wrote of the time of his death.\n\nWhich one of the daughters was the H\u0101j\u012b Begam of 983H. is not clear. It would seem that this was her second pilgrimage, since she is enrolled as H\u0101j\u012b before starting. K\u0101mr\u0101n's daughters may have gone\u2014one or all\u2014to Makka after his blinding and during the four years of his life there. Of the three, Gul-rukh is the only one of whom it is on record that she was widowed in 983H., and therefore quite free to make the Haj. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm \u1e24usain died in 981H. (1573).\n\nH\u0101j\u012b Begam was visited by Akbar and she died in 991H. (1583).\n\nGul-badan, 77a, 78a.\nAkbar-n\u0101ma, III. 145, 373, 375.\n\nXX.

The latter died in 989H. before Gul-badan's party returned. Bega Begam went to Makka in 972H..\nappears in the biography of poetesses by Fakhri am\u012br\u012b. M\u012brz\u0101 \u1e24aidar says that some of her children and of two other Mughal kh\u0101nams (Daulat and Q\u016b\u1e6d-l\u012bq) who were forcibly married at the same time, were living and reigning in Transoxiana at the time of his writing the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-rash\u012bd\u012b.

(September, 1540), the year of the Tim\u016brid exodus from India. She fell into the hands of her uncle \u1e24askar\u012b with her father\u2019s camp and the baby Akbar in 1543. In 1545 she was sent with Akbar in the depth of winter from Qandah\u0101r to K\u0101bul. In 957H. (1550), and when ten years old, she was betrothed by her father to Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, son of Sulaim\u0101n and Haram. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm (b. 1534) was six years older than Bakhsh\u012b-b\u0101n\u016b, and he was killed in 1560, leaving her a widow of twenty. In the same year she was given in marriage by Akbar to M\u012brz\u0101 Sharafudd\u012bn Husain A\u1e25r\u0101r\u012b.\n\nGul-badan, 39b.\nAkbar-n\u0101ma, s.n..\n\nXXVII. Bakhtu-n-nis\u0101 Begam.\n\nFelicity of womanhood; Pers. bakht, felicity, fortune, and nis\u0101\u2019, woman.\n\nShe was a daughter of Hum\u0101y\u016bn and M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak, and was born in 957H. (1550). Gul-badan says that she received her name in accordance with Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s interpretation of a dream. There is, however, ground for thinking that she and Fakhru-n-nis\u0101\u2019, both mentioned in the histories as daughters of M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak, are one and the same person. Gul-badan enumerates three daughters of M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak, and says that there were four. It is her habit to state, in such matters, one more than she names. She mentions Bakht, but not Fakhr.\n\nOf Bakhtu-n-nis\u0101\u2019 it is recorded in the histories that she came from K\u0101bul to India with her son Diw\u0101l\u012b, after the death of M\u012brz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Hak\u012bm, her brother (993H.\u20141584-85), and that she was concerned in a reconciliation effected by Sal\u012bma-sult\u0101n Begam between Akbar and Sal\u012bm.\nOf Fakhru-n-nis\u0101 it is recorded that she married Sh\u0101h Ab\u016b'l-ma'\u0101l\u012b Termizi and Khw\u0101ja \u1e24asan Naqshband\u012b.\n\nGul-badan, 71a.\nKh\u0101f\u012b Kh\u0101n (Bib.

Bega Begam and Bibi.\n\nThe Emperor Jah\u0101ng\u012br, when in his Memoirs enumerating the gardens of K\u0101bul, mentions one which belonged to Bega Begam, a widow of his father\u2019s grandfather, i.e., B\u0101bar. Which of B\u0101bar\u2019s wives is indicated by this title cannot be said with certainty.\n\nJauhar has a story of K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s want of consideration for \u2018Bega Begam,\u2019 in which the points useful here are that on the day in 1545 when Hum\u0101y\u016bn took K\u0101bul from K\u0101mr\u0101n, he asked for food from Bega Begam, and he said of her that she was the very person who had brought B\u0101bar\u2019s bones and laid them in K\u0101bul.\n\nThese two references of Jah\u0101ng\u012br and Jauhar are probably to the same lady. Of B\u0101bar\u2019s wives, Bibi Mub\u0101rika (Afgh\u0101n\u012b \u0101gh\u0101cha) appears to me the most suitable to the time and task.\n\nB\u0101bar\u2019s body was still in its \u0100gra tomb in 1539. (Gul-badan, 34b.) M\u0101ham was then dead; Dil-d\u0101r\u2019s movements exclude her from consideration; Gul-rukh, if living, will have left \u0100gra with her son K\u0101mr\u0101n before the Tim\u016brid exodus was enforced by defeat at Kanauj; Bibi Mub\u0101rika remains, the probable and appropriate agent for fulfilling B\u0101bar\u2019s wish as to the final disposition of his body. She lived into Akbar\u2019s reign, and her character and respected position in the household add to the sum of probability that she would discharge this duty.\n\nB\u0101bar\u2019s body was not removed till after the fitrat, i.e., the Tim\u016brid downfall and exodus. Bega Begam,\nor, as we may call her with Jauhar for the sake of clearness, the Bibi, must therefore have remained behind the rest of the royal family. This may have occurred in one of two natural ways. She might have stayed in Agra under the protection of one of the religious families and safeguarded by pious duty to Babar's tomb, until Shir Khan gave permission to remove the body and a safe escort for her journey to his frontier; or she may even have been in Bengal and at Chausa with Humayun, and, like Bega (Haj\u012b) Begam, have been made captive. It would harmonize with Shir Khan's known actions if he had allowed Babar's widow to remove his bones, and if he had aided her pious task.\n\n*Tuzuk-i-jahangiri*, lith. ed., 51.\n*Humayun-nama*, Jauhar, Pers. text, s.a. 951H.

She was Babar's first cousin, and may be that daughter of her father who married Mu\u1e25ammad Ma\u015f\u016bm Mirz\u0101 Bayqra. Gul-badan styles her 'ama, paternal aunt, of Humayun; anglice, she and he were first cousins, once removed. She was at the Mystic Feast in December, 1531.\n\nGul-badan, 24b.\nMems., 180.\n\nXXXIV. Bega Begam Miran-shahi. (? No. 22. Bega Kilan Begam.)\n\nDaughter of Sultan Mahmud Mirz\u0101 and Kh\u0101n-z\u0101da II. Termizi; wife of \u1e24aidar Mirz\u0101 Bayqra and mother of Sh\u0101d Begam (No. 28).\n\nIn 901H. (1496) Sultan Husain Bayqra was besieging Hisar which was held for Bega's brother Mas'\u016bd,\nand in which she was. Husain became apprehensive about the spring rains and patched up a peace, the seal of which was Bega\u2019s marriage with his son Haidar, her first cousin through his mother, P\u0101yanda-sult\u0101n. The betrothal took place outside the fort, with assistance of such music as could be procured, and later when the bride was taken to Har\u0101t, the marriage was celebrated with the splendour loved by Husain and befitting a Tim\u016brid alliance. Haidar was a full Tim\u016brid; Bega was one on her father\u2019s side, and probably as a Termizi sayyida\u2019s daughter, drew through her also a strain of the same blood.\n\nHaidar died before his father; i.e., before 912H. (April, 1506).\n\nMems., 30, 38, 180.\nGul-badan, (?) 24b, No. 22.\n\nXXXV. Bega (\u1e24aj\u012b) Begam (?) Begchik Mughal. (? No. 50.)\n\nShe was a daughter of Uncle (\u1e6dag\u1e25\u0101\u012b) Y\u0101dg\u0101r Beg who was, I think, a brother of Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b Mirz\u0101, father of K\u0101mran\u2019s wife, Gul-rukh. Ab\u016b\u2019l-fazl calls Bega Begam dukhtar-i-\u1e6dag\u1e25\u0101\u012b-i-w\u0101lida-i-Jannat-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b. Y\u0101dg\u0101r and \u2018Al\u012b Begechik are both styled M\u012brz\u0101, but this elevation is due, it seems, to their alliances with the royal house. Haidar calls their brothers m\u012brs.\n\nBega married Hum\u0101y\u016bn, her first cousin, and she was the wife of his youth. It is out of harmony with the custom of his house that his chief wife should be of less than royal descent. So far as I have been able to trace the matter, he never made an equal marriage. Gul-barg Barl\u0101s, \u2018Khalifa\u2019s\u2019 daughter, whose second husband he was, had best claim to high birth.\n\nThe first son, perhaps first child, of Bega and Hum\u0101y\u016bn was Al-am\u0101n, born 934H. or 935H. (1528) when his father was about twenty-one and was in Badakhsh\u0101n. B\u0101bar has commemorated his birth both by mentioning it and by preserving his own\ncongratulatory letter to the young father. Al-am\u0101n died in infancy.\n\nBega came to India after B\u0101bar\u2019s death (December, 1530), and her second and last-mentioned child, \u2019Af\u012bfa (\u2019Aq\u012bqa) was born in 1531.\n\nIn 1534 (circa) Gul-badan\u2019s story (29b, 30b) shows Bega as resenting neglect by Hum\u0101y\u016bn who accepts invitations to his sisters\u2019 quarters in camp in preference to hers and Gul-barg\u2019s. Some impressions of this story make one question whether the Bega it tells of is Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s wife or another. But the circumstances that she is associated with a wife, Gul-barg; that Gul-badan does not speak of her as being other than the \u2018Bega Begam\u2019 of the home circle; Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s allusions to the elder kinswomen; and the absence of the deference customary to an elder woman, seem sufficient justification for identifying the complaining Bega with the wife. (Gul-badan, it may be observed, mentions one other Bega Begam\u2014i.e., Mir\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b, daughter of Ulugh Beg Kabuli.)\n\nBega was with Hum\u0101y\u016bn during the idleness of his decadence in Bengal, and with her was her sister, the wife of Zah\u012bd Beg. Zah\u012bd offended Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and Bega tried in vain to obtain his forgiveness.\n\nShe was captured at Chausa by Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n, and here she lost her little girl, \u2019Aq\u012bqa. The historians all call her \u1e24\u0101j\u012b Begam in recording her capture; it is only Gul-badan who calls her Bega Begam. She was returned in safety to Hum\u0101y\u016bn under the escort of Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n\u2019s best general, Khaw\u0101\u1e63 Kh\u0101n. How soon she was returned I am not able to say. Support is to be found for the view that she was sent to \u0100gra directly after Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s arrival there, and also for the view that she was not returned to him until after a considerable time had elapsed. I do not know whether she went to Sind with the exiles or was sent later direct to K\u0101bul. She was in K\u0101bul with the royal family after 1545. She remained there with the\nother ladies when Hum\u0101y\u016bn made his expedition to recover Hind\u016bst\u0101n, and she came with \u1e24am\u012bda, Gul-badan, and the rest to join Akbar in 964H. (1557). After this she built her husband\u2019s tomb near Dihl\u012b, and became its faithful attendant.\n\nAkbar is said to have been much attached to her, and she was to him like a second mother. She went to Makka in 972H. (1564-65), and returned three years later. One thing raises the question whether this was her first pilgrimage, viz., the fact that all the sources, except Gul-badan\u2019s, call her \u1e24\u0101j\u012b Begam. Why is she singled out to bear this title? It had been earned by many royal ladies before any one of the trio of great writers under Akbar had put pen to paper. The same unexplained distinction is conferred by the histories on a daughter of K\u0101mr\u0101n. In both these cases a renewed pilgrimage might serve as the explanation of the distinction.\n\nBega Begam died in 989H. (1581), shortly before Gul-badan\u2019s return from Makka. She had almost certainly passed her seventieth year, and was perhaps still older. Ab\u016b\u2019l-fa\u017cl says that her affairs were settled by one Q\u0101sim \u2018Al\u012b Kh\u0101n. He also records a visit of Akbar to her in her last illness, as well as an earlier visit of hers to him made from Dihl\u012b in 981H.\n\nGul-badan, 22a, 23b, 29b, 30b, 78b, 83a.\nMems., 388, 390.\nAkbar-n\u0101ma, Bib.

Ch\u016bl\u012b Begam Az\u0101k.\n\nThe Desert Princess; Pers. ch\u016bl, desert. The Memoirs have J\u016bl\u012b, but the meaning of ch\u016bl\u012b (which looks like a sobriquet) suits the descent of the begam better than anything which can be extracted from j\u016bl. Ilminsky writes J\u016bl\u012b, but for this the Mems. are his possible warrant. B.M. Pers. Or. 16,623, f. 123, l. 7., has a clearly-pointed ch\u016bl\u012b; also on f. 124b.\n\nCh\u016bl\u012b (J\u016bl\u012b) Begam was a daughter of a beg of the Az\u0101ks, and married Sult\u0101n \u1e24usain B\u0101ygr\u0101 before he conquered Khur\u0101s\u0101n in 878H.

(Cf. \u2018\u0100yisha.)\n\nGul-badan, 78b.\n\nXLIV. Daulat-bakht Bibi. (No. 85.)\n\nShe was clearly an active and working member of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s household. She appeared to him in a dream (71a), and her name formed a part of Bakhtun-nis\u0101\u2019s. She went on before the main body of begams when they visited the waterfall at Farza, and saw to the commissariat. She is named as being at Hind\u0101l\u2019s marriage feast.\nShe may be the Daulat-bakht \u0101gh\u0101cha of the preceding notice.\n\nGul-badan, 26b, 71a, 74a.\n\nXLV. Daulat-kitta (?) Argh\u016bn.\n\nKitta I find only as a Turk\u012b word, meaning noble, powerful. With it the name would be a mongrel of Arabic and Turk\u012b. Perhaps Daulat-giti might be read.\n\nShe was a servant in M\u012brz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Muq\u012bm Argh\u016bn\u2019s house, and was an intermediary in effecting the elopement of her master\u2019s daughter, M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak Argh\u016bn, from K\u0101bul. Mr. Erskine tells the story admirably.\n\nB. & H., I. 348 et seq., and the sources there referred to.\n\nXLVI.

Rash., E. & R., 88.\n\nXLVII. Daulat-sult\u0101n Kh\u0101nam Chaghata\u012b Mughal.\n\nAr. daulat, fortune, and sult\u0101n, sway. In many proper names, sult\u0101n does not appear to be a title, but rather to indicate the sway or dominance of the quality imputed by the first word of the name; e.g., Lat\u012bf-sult\u0101n, Daulat-sult\u0101n. In giving these names, one might suppose the prophetic notion to be that the first child should be a regnant delight and the second a prevailing felicity.\n\nYoungest child of Y\u016bnas Kh\u0101n Chaghata\u012b and Sh\u0101h Begam Badakhsh\u012b; half-sister of B\u0101bar\u2019s mother; wife by chance of battle, of Tim\u016br Sult\u0101n Uzbeg; mother by him of a daughter.\n\nIn 907H. (1501-2) she was in T\u0101shkand, and Q\u016b\u1e6d-liq-nig\u0101r Kh\u0101nam went to visit her after thirteen or fourteen years of separation. B\u0101bar, dejected and an exile, joined the family party in the next year. In 909H. (1503) Shaib\u0101n\u012b sacked T\u0101shkand and forcibly married\nDaulat-sult\u0101n to his son Tim\u016br. She bore him a daughter, and she remained in his \u1e25aram until B\u0101bar took possession of Samarqand in 917H. (1511), and she joined him. She went south with him in 1513, and remained several years in Badakhsh\u0101n with another nephew, M\u012brz\u0101 (Wais) Kh\u0101n who behaved to her like a son.\n\nAnother nephew, Sa\u02bf\u012bd, her own brother A\u1e25mad\u2019s son, then invited her, with costly gifts, to visit him in K\u0101shghar. She made the long and difficult journey; joined him in Yarkand; and with him she spent the rest of her life.\n\nBabar mentions that her foster-brother brought him news and letters from her in 925H. (September 8th, 1519). In the same year Mans\u016br, Sa\u02bf\u012bd\u2019s eldest brother, went to K\u0101shghar to visit her, his \u2018beloved aunt.\u2019\n\nThe Persian text of the T\u0101rikh-i-rashidi says that Mans\u016br went so that by looking at her kind face his grief for the loss of his father might be mitigated. The Bible Society\u2019s Turk\u012b version reads: \u2018Being prompted thereto by the extreme warmth of his affection for her.\u2019 Both statements illumine her character. The second seems the more appropriate, since the death of Sult\u0101n A\u1e25mad Kh\u0101n took place in 909H. (1503) and Mansur\u2019s visit in 926H. (1520).\n\nThere is no mention of her remarriage, and her story is that of an affectionate and leisured aunt.\n\nMems., 14, 99, 105, 274.\nT\u0101r. Rash., E. & R., 108, 117, 156, 160, 351, 352, 356.\n\nXLVIII. Daulat-sult\u0101n (?) Sakanj Begam.\n\nSakanj I cannot explain. B. M. Add. 24,090 (44b) has no points, and the word may be S-k-n-gh. B. M., Or. 137 (48a) has k-m-n-j or b-k-n-j. The Turk\u012b (Bible Society\u2019s MS. translations) has Daulat.\n\nDaughter of Am\u012br Shaikh N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Q\u012bbch\u0101q Mughal, governor of Turkist\u0101n; wife of Wais Kh\u0101n Chaghat\u0101\u012b Mughal.\n\nT\u0101r. Rash., E. & R., 64 and 64 n..\nXLIX. Dil-d\u0101r Begam. (No. 48.)\n\nThe Heart-holding Princess; Pers. dil, heart, and d\u0101r, holding.\n\nNeither her husband, B\u0101bar nor her daughter, Gul-badan gives any clue to her parentage. Her marriage is not spoken of in the Memoirs; it, as well as Gul-rukh\u2019s, probably occurred in the missing decade of 1509-19. If B\u0101bar held the view that four wives were a lawful number, Dil-d\u0101r, of whatever parentage, may be counted amongst them, since in 1509 M\u0101ham only remained of his earlier wives, \u0100yisha, Zainab, and Ma\u2019s\u016bma having disappeared from the household by death or divorce.\n\nDil-d\u0101r is mentioned once in the Turk\u012b text of Kehr and Ilminsky, and then as agh\u0101cha. I am too ignorant of the import of this word in the domestic circle to venture to draw from its use an inference as to social status. It, however, as used by B\u0101bar and by Gul-badan, supports Pavet de Courteille\u2019s definition of a \u2018lady\u2019 in contradistinction to a \u2018begam,\u2019 and does not convey reproach to the woman as its occasional English rendering (concubine) does.\n\nThe Akbar-n\u0101ma (Bib. Ind. ed., II. 62) makes use of the words \u2018Dil-d\u0101r agh\u0101cha Begam,\u2019 and adds agh\u0101 as a variant (cf. App., s.n. agh\u0101). Gul-badan always styles her mother begam, and sometimes hazrat. In enumerating her father\u2019s children and their mothers, she does not mention the parentage of any wife besides Ma\u2019s\u016bma Mir\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b, a T\u012bm\u016brid, but no deduction as to the lower birth of the others can be drawn safely from this, and there is some ground for supposing that Dil-d\u0101r was of Mir\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b birth. (Cf. infra, p. 277.)\n\nPerhaps some indication of non-royal birth is given by M\u0101ham\u2019s forcible adoption of Dil-d\u0101r\u2019s son in 1519, but I am too ignorant of the nuances of Muhammadan etiquette to venture on assertion or even on opinion in such a matter. That M\u0101ham did not take Gul-\nrukh\u2019s\\(^1\\) son tells nothing, since the chief factors in the adoption, *i.e.*, M\u0101ham\u2019s loss of her own children and wish to adopt, may have become operative only when they were put into practice in 1519.\n\nFive children of Dil-d\u0101r are mentioned by Gul-badan: Gul-rang, born between 1511 and 1515; Gul-chihra; Ab\u016b-n-na\u1e63\u012br Mu\u1e25ammad (Hind\u0101l), born 1519; Gul-badan, born 1523; and Alwar, who died in India in 1529.\n\nShe is very frequently written of by her daughter; some other authors give of her a clear and pleasant impression; and she is always spoken of with respect and as a good and sensible woman.\n\nGul-badan, 6b, 16a, 23a, 25b, 29b, 30a, 35a, 35b, 38a, 42a, 50b, 51b, 65a, 70b.\nJauhar, Stewart, 30, 31.\nIlminsky, 281.\n*Akbar-n\u0101ma*, Bib.

She was with him subsequently in Sind, and from there went with Sult\u0101nam to Makka previous to 1543.\n\nShe was buried in Dihli. M\u012br Ma\u02bf\u0161\u016bm writes of her death: \u2018She entrusted her soul to the guardians of the hour of death, and the leaves (gul-barg) of the rose-bush of her life were dispersed by the boisterous wind of mortality.\u2019\n\nGul-badan, 21a, 25b, 29b, 30b, 49b.\nT\u0101r\u012bkh-i-sind, M\u012br Ma\u02bf\u0161\u016bm.\nB. & H., I. 385.\nLXVIII.

The marriage was arranged by B\u0101bar, and took place in 937H. (end of 1530). She would then be about fourteen years old.\n\nShe was widowed cir. 940H. (1533), and nothing as to her remarriage is recorded until 956H. (1549), when she was over thirty years old. It is improbable that she remained a widow so many years. (Cf. App. s.n. Salima-sult\u0101n.) In 956H. she entered upon what looks like a mariage de raison with \u2018Abb\u0101s Sult\u0101n Uzbeg, just before Hum\u0101y\u016bn set out on his expedition for Balkh. The bridegroom came to suspect that the Timurid army was about to act against his own people and ran away. Probably he did not take Gul-chihra with him. Her name next appears in the histories when she accompanies Gul-badan and \u1e24am\u012bda to India in 964H. (1557).\n\nGul-badan, 6b, 16b, 18b, 23b, 25b, 29b, 38a, 65a.\n\nAkbar-n\u0101ma, Bib.

(1526).\n\nShe was at Hind\u0101l's wedding-feast, and shared in the conferences of Hum\u0101y\u016bn and his family; and she was one of Gul-badan Begam's pilgrim band (983H., 1575).\n\nGul-badan, 25b, 30a, 35a, 38a.\nMems., 347.\n*Akbar-n\u0101ma, Bib.

She was born in Khost, probably between 1511 and 1515, during B\u0101bar's exile from K\u0101bul after the Mughal rebellion. She was given in marriage to Is\u0101n-tim\u016br Chaghat\u0101i Mughal, her father's first cousin, during the last days of her father's life and in 1530.\nIs\u0101n-t\u012bm\u016br is last mentioned in 1543, and of Gul-rang there is no certain record after cir. 1534, when she was at Gu\u0101li\u0101r.

Outside K\u0101bul there was in 1545 the tomb of Gul-rukh Begam. (64b) This may well have been hers.\n\nShe is perhaps a Begchik. This may be judged from the following notes:\n\n(1) K\u0101mr\u0101n married a daughter of Sult\u0101n \u2019Al\u012b M\u012brz\u0101 \u1e6dagh\u0101\u012b.\u00b9 (Mems., 388.)\n\n(2) Hum\u0101y\u016bn married a daughter of Y\u0101dg\u0101r \u1e6dagh\u0101\u012b. (Mems., 388.)\n\nAmongst contemporary Begchik am\u012brs are Sult\u0101n Al\u012b M\u012brz\u0101 and Y\u0101dg\u0101r M\u012brz\u0101.\n\nIf one follows the recorded incidents of Sult\u0101n \u2019Al\u012b\u2019s life, one sees that Gul-rukh may be his sister.\n\n(a) In 914H. (1508-9) he was ordered to drown Khalil Kh\u0101n. (T\u0101r. R\u0101sh., 183.) Having done so, he took refuge with B\u0101bar in Samarqand. (l.c., 265.)\n\n(b) In 917H. (1511) he was with Sayyid Mu\u1e25ammad Dughl\u0101t in Andij\u0101n, apparently at B\u0101bar\u2019s instance. (l.c., 248.) In the same year he was sent by Sa\u02bf\u012bd\n\n\u00b9 This is a difficult word to deal with. It has a wider use than its usual translation \u2018mother\u2019s brother.\u2019 It is used for the uncle, great-uncle, etc., in ascending line. In other words, the mother\u2019s brother, in at any rate distinguished families, of one generation remains the mother\u2019s brother, \u1e6dagh\u0101\u012b, in the next and the next. Once a \u1e6dagh\u0101\u012b, always a \u1e6dagh\u0101\u012b. The numerous uncles on the mother\u2019s side who appear in the Memoirs and the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-rash\u012bd\u012b as so-and-so \u1e6dagh\u0101\u012b, might be described as brothers of the mothers of a king\u2019s or chief\u2019s children.\n\nTo found opinion of relationship on the unsupported use of the word is to court disaster. Great wariness is needed. A quite perplexing \u1e6dagh\u0101\u012b is the Machiavelli of M\u012brz\u0101 \u1e24aidar\u2019s life, \u2019Al\u012b M\u012brz\u0101 \u1e6dagh\u0101\u012b (Dughl\u0101t). He is constantly on the scene, and the one fact not mentioned which it is desirable to know is, whose brother was he? Only with much trouble can a surmise as to his parentage be hazarded.\nKh\u0101n who had reinforced Andij\u0101n under B\u0101bar\u2019s orders, to K\u0101z\u0101n.\n\n(c) In 920H. (1514) he accompanied Sa\u02bf\u012bd in his conquest of K\u0101shghar, and at this date is named amongst the Begchik am\u012brs of the K\u0101shghar army. (l.c., 308, 326.)\n\n(d) In 925H. (1519) he waited on B\u0101bar, and is styled \u1e6dagha\u012b of K\u0101mr\u0101n. (Mems., 274.) B\u0101bar says here: \u2018Sult\u0101n \u02bfAl\u012b M\u012brz\u0101, the maternal uncle of K\u0101mr\u0101n (Ilminsky, 311, K\u0101mr\u0101n-n\u012bnak \u1e6dagha\u012b), who in the year in which I passed over from Khost to K\u0101bul had proceeded to K\u0101shghar, as has been mentioned,\u00b9 waited on me here.\u2019\n\nB\u0101bar must several times have passed from Khost (Andar-\u0101b) to K\u0101bul. The T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-rash\u012bd\u012b fixes the occasion here alluded to as in 920H. (1514). This was B\u0101bar\u2019s latest and last crossing of the northern passes to Kabul.\n\nBy thus bringing the statements of the Memoirs and the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-rash\u012bd\u012b together, Sult\u0101n \u02bfAl\u012b M\u012brz\u0101 Begchik is fairly-well identified with Sult\u0101n \u02bfAl\u012b M\u012brz\u0101, \u1e6dagha\u012b of K\u0101mr\u0101n.\u2019\n\n(e) In 935H.

The period of Sa\u02bf\u012bd\u2019s K\u0101shghar conquest falls in a gap of the T\u016bzz\u016bk. B\u0101bar referred to an incident of that time as having been already mentioned. This suggests, as a cause of the gap, lost leaves, and not an omission of record. (Cf. T\u0101r. Rash., 247 n.)\nThe story of her husband\u2019s rebellious pursuit and death (981H., 1573), and of her flight to the Dakhin with her son, is found at length in the histories.\n\nShe was living and visited by Jah\u0101ng\u012br in 1023H. (1614). (Cf. XIX. \u2018\u0100yisha-sult\u0101n.)\n\nLXXVII.

It may be that she married a second time after she was forcibly parted from Yas\u012bn-daulat in 1551-52. (Cf.

Shortly before Shaib\u0101n\u012b murdered her father (914H., 1508-9), 'Ubaidu-l-l\u0101h asked for Haidar (\u00e6tat. 11) to come to him and \u1e24ab\u012bba in Bukh\u0101r\u0101, and thus saved him from a general massacre of Mughal sult\u0101ns.\n\nWhen 'Ubaidu-l-l\u0101h retreated to Turkist\u0101n (cir. 1511), \u1e24ab\u012bba remained in Bukh\u0101r\u0101. She then joined her uncle Sayyid Mu\u1e25ammad Dughl\u0101t, in Samarqand, and with him went to Andij\u0101n where he married her to her cousin Sa\u02bf\u012bd. She reared one of Sa\u02bf\u012bd's children, Rash\u012bd whose mother was a 'tribeswoman,' Makhd\u016bm Q\u0101l\u016bch\u012b, but he certainly did her training no credit. She was widowed in 939H. (July 9th, 1533), so that Gul-badan may be wrong in saying that she was at the Mystic Feast in 1531. She may have been a wedding guest in 1537.\n\n*T\u0101r.

There is difficulty in making precise statement as to her family relations. She was of the lineage of A\u1e25mad J\u0101m\u012b Zinda-fil.\n\n(a). Gul-badan, whose long intimacy with \u1e24am\u012bda invests her statement with authority, states that M\u012br B\u0101b\u0101 Dost was \u1e24am\u012bda\u2019s father, and that Khw\u0101ja Mu\u2019azzam was her bar\u0101dar, i.e., brother undefined.\n\n(b). The T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-sind states that her father was Shaikh \u2018Al\u012b-akbar J\u0101m\u012b who was one of the pillars of M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l. Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn A\u1e25mad says that \u2018Al\u012b-akbar was father of Mu\u2019azzam.\n\nIf the statements of paragraphs (a) and (b) stood alone, \u2018B\u0101b\u0101 Dost\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Al\u012b-akbar\u2019 might be identified as the petit-nom and the name of one man.\n\nThere is a good deal to support this view, and there is something against it.\n\nIn favour of the identification of B\u0101b\u0101 Dost with \u2018Al\u012b-akbar are the following points:\n\n(1). \u2018B\u0101b\u0101 Dost\u2019 seems to be not a personal name, but a sobriquet of affection and domestic intimacy.\n\n(2). Jauhar calls \u1e24am\u012bda the daughter of Hind\u0101l\u2019s akhund, and Mr. Erskine (perhaps, however, inferentially) calls \u2018Al\u012b-akbar Hind\u0101l\u2019s preceptor.\n\n(3). M\u012br B\u0101b\u0101 Dost was alive in 947H. (1540-41), the year preceding \u1e24am\u012bda\u2019s marriage, and was then with Hind\u0101l. (Akbar-n\u0101ma, H. Beveridge, I. 360.)\n\n(4). Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn A\u1e25mad and Badayun\u012b contribute negative support to the identification by using the\nindefinite *khal*, maternal uncle, to describe the relation of Akbar and Mu\u2019azzam.\n\n(5). *The Ma\u2019\u0101siru-l-umar\u0101\u2019* confirms the identification by use of the words *bar\u0101dar-i-a\u2019y\u0101n\u012b*, full-brother. Its authority may not be of the best, but the choice of these words has some weight.\n\n(6). \u2019Al\u012b-akbar was of the lineage of A\u1e25mad J\u0101m\u012b. Hum\u0101yun had a dream which allowed him to know that the son prophesied in it by A\u1e25mad would be of the latter\u2019s lineage. There is, I think, nothing said on this point of M\u012br B\u0101b\u0101 Dost, but saintly descent was claimed for \u1e24am\u012bda\u2019s father.\n\n(7). Gul-badan gives one the impression (it is little more) that Mu\u2019azzam was younger than \u1e24am\u012bda. He calls his sister *M\u0101h-chich\u0101m*, which may be read as \u2018Moon of my mother,\u2019 but also as \u2018Elder Moon-sister.\u2019 *(Cf. 18b n.)* If he were \u1e24am\u012bda\u2019s junior, and as M\u012br B\u0101b\u0101 Dost was alive in 1540-41, he could not have been an independent agent in 1543-44.\n\nIn opposition to the identification, there are two considerations:\n\n(i.) A minor matter; two names are given by the sources: M\u012br B\u0101b\u0101 Dost and \u2019Al\u012b-akbar.\n\n(ii.) The important fact that Ab\u016b\u2019l-fa\u017cl calls Mu\u2019azzam \u1e24am\u012bda\u2019s *ukhuwwat-i-akhy\u0101fi*,\u00b9 which, according to Lane, must be rendered \u2018uterine brother.\u2019\n\nWas, then, the name B\u0101b\u0101 Dost a sobriquet of Shaikh \u2019Al\u012b-akbar?\n\nWere \u1e24am\u012bda and Mu\u2019azzam full brother and sister? Were they the children of one father and two mothers, or were they uterine brother and sister?\n\nShaikh \u2019Al\u012b-akbar\u2019s name I have not found in any\n\n\u00b9 Steingass does not recognise the force of \u2018uterine,\u2019 since he renders *bar\u0101dar-i-a\u2019y\u0101n\u012b* by \u2018uterine brother.\u2019\npassage except the one dealing with \u1e24am\u012bda\u2019s parentage. M\u012br Bab\u0101 Dost may be the man so named by B\u0101bar (Mems., 262), and who was then with Hum\u0101y\u016bn in the year of the birth of Hind\u0101l (1519). He may also have gone with Hum\u0101y\u016bn, \u1e24am\u012bda (? his own daughter) and Mu\u2018azzam (? his son) to Persia, the bakhsh\u012b in the little party of exiles. He is mentioned by Ab\u016b\u2019l-fa\u017cl not only where already noted, but, we believe, also amongst Hind\u0101l\u2019s servants who were transferred to Akbar in 1551 (958H.).\n\nTwo men with the name \u2018Al\u012b-akbar are mentioned under Akbar, but neither appears to be a J\u0101m\u012b, or to warrant identification with \u1e24am\u012bda\u2019s reputed father. (Cf. \u0100\u012bn-i-akbar\u012b, Blochmann, s.n. \u2018Al\u012b-akbar.)\n\nWhether there was any relationship more close than that derived from common descent from A\u1e25mad J\u0101m\u012b between M\u0101ham Begam and \u1e24am\u012bda I am not able to say.\n\n\u1e24am\u012bda was related to B\u0101n\u016b (B\u0101b\u016b) \u0101gh\u0101 who was the wife of Shih\u0101bu-d-din A\u1e25mad Nish\u0101p\u016br\u012b and a relation of M\u0101ham anaga. Bega (\u1e24aji) Begam also had claim to descent from A\u1e25mad J\u0101m\u012b, so that the saint\u2019s posterity was numerous in Akbar\u2019s court, and included the Emperor himself.\n\nTo Gul-badan\u2019s account of the discussion which preceded \u1e24am\u012bda\u2019s marriage, there may be added the following passage from the Tazkiratu-l-w\u0101qi\u2018at of Jauhar. (I.O. MS. No. 221 and B.M. MS. Add. No. 16,711, f. 82.) After Hum\u0101y\u016bn has asked whose daughter \u1e24am\u012bda is, he is told, perhaps by Dil-d\u0101r, that she is of the line of his Reverence the Terrible Elephant, A\u1e25mad J\u0101m\u012b, and that her father, by way of blessing and benediction, has taught Mirz\u0101 Hind\u0101l, and that for this reason \u1e24am\u012bda is with the m\u012brz\u0101\u2019s household.\n\nThe Persian (taken from the I.O. MS.) is as follows: Pidar-i-\u012bsh\u0101n do sih kalma ba jihat-i-tabarruk\nwa tayammun ba Mirz\u0101 Hind\u0101l sabq farmudand. Az \u0101n jihat ba m\u0101 hamr\u0101 and.\n\nErskine (II. 220) and Stewart (Jauhar, 31 n.) both say that Ham\u012bda was married at fourteen years of age. The incidents of her wedded life are set down in Gul-badan Begam\u2019s book and in the Akbar-n\u0101ma and other sources; but having regard to her interesting personality, they may be enumerated here also.\n\nShe was married at P\u0101t early in 948H. (summer, 1541), and remained in Sind until she made with Hum\u0101y\u016bn the terrible desert journey to \u2018Umrkut where Akbar was born (October 15th, 1542). About the beginning of the following December she and her baby went into camp at J\u016bn, after travelling for ten or twelve days. In 1543 she made the perilous journey from Sind which had Qandah\u0101r for its goal, but in course of which Hum\u0101y\u016bn had to take hasty flight from Sh\u0101l-mast\u0101n, \u2018through a desert and waterless waste.\u2019 She went with him, leaving her little son behind. She accompanied her husband to Persia, and it is recorded that on the way and at Sist\u0101n, its governor brought his mother and his wives to entertain her. With Hum\u0101y\u016bn she made, amongst other pious visitations, one to J\u0101m where was their ancestor Ahm\u0101d\u2019s shrine. She was kindly treated by Sh\u0101h Tahm\u0101sp and by his sister, and Gul-badan\u2019s details of the Persian episode can hardly have been learned from anyone but \u1e24am\u012bda. In 1544, in camp at Sabz-\u0101w\u0101r, a daughter was born. She returned from Persia with the army given to Hum\u0101y\u016bn by Tahm\u0101sp, and at Qandah\u0101r would meet Dil-d\u0101r and Hind\u0101l, her former protectors.\n\nIt was not until November 15th, 1545 (Ramzan 10th, 952H.) that she again saw her son, who recognised her. She had shortly after this to accept M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak as a co-wife. In June, 1548, she and Akbar accompanied Hum\u0101y\u016bn on his way to T\u0101liq\u0101n as far as Gul-bih\u0101r, and thence returned to K\u0101bul. This may\nbe the expedition made by the ladies and chronicled by Gul-badan, to see the *riw\u0101j*. When Hum\u0101y\u016bn, in November, 1554, set out for Hind\u016bst\u0101n, she remained in K\u0101bul.\n\nB\u0101yaz\u012bd *biy\u0101t* mentions that at this time he fell under her displeasure, and was reproved because he had not cleared out a house for one of her servants. He pleaded the commands of Mu\u02bfnim Kh\u0101n, and was forgiven. Early in the reign of Akbar, Khw\u0101ja M\u012brak, Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn\u2019s grandfather and who was her *diw\u0101n*, was hanged by Mu\u02bfnim Kh\u0101n because he had sided with M\u012brz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n.\n\nShe rejoined her son in the second year of his reign (964H., 1557), together with Gul-badan and other royal ladies. She is mentioned as in Dihl\u012b in the fifth year, and she had a part in the plot for deposing Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n. She was closely associated with Gul-badan in Akbar\u2019s court and affection; together they interceded for Sal\u012bm with his father; together they received gifts from the Emperor; and their tents were side by side in his encampments. \u1e24am\u012bda was with Gul-badan in the latter\u2019s last hours.\n\nAb\u016b\u02bel-fa\u017cl says that when long fasts came to an end, the first dishes of dressed meat used to go to Akbar from his mother\u2019s house.\n\n\u1e24am\u012bda died in the autumn of 1604 (19th Shahr\u012by\u0101r 1013H.), sixty-three years after her wedding, and after almost fifty years of widowhood, passed as the proud mother of a great son. If she was fourteen in 1541, she must have been born in 1527 (*circa*), the year of B\u0101bar\u2019s victory at Kh\u0101nwa, and have been some seventy-seven years old at the time of death.\n\nGul-badan, 39a, 42a, 43b, 48a, 55a, 55b, 58a, 59b, 62b, 66a, 74a, 78b, 83a.\nAkbar-n\u0101ma, Bib.

Her name has been transliterated by some European workers as Khurr\u0101m, 'blossoming, cheerful,' and this seems the more probable name to bestow on a child. But some of the Persian texts support Haram, and the editors of the Bib. Ind. Akbar-n\u0101ma have adopted it. Gul-badan has Haram.\n\nHaram Begam may be a sobriquet bestowed after the revelation of the facts of the bearer's character and dominance.\n\nDaughter of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Wais Kul\u0101b\u012b Qibch\u0101q Mughal; and sister of Chakr\u2019Al\u012b and Haidar Begs and of M\u0101h Begam, a wife of K\u0101mr\u0101n. She married Sulaim\u0101n Mirz\u0101 Mir\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b, son of Kh\u0101n Mirz\u0101 (Wais). She had one son, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm (Ab\u016b\u2019l-q\u0101sim), and several daughters. Her children, through Sh\u0101h Begam Badakhsh\u012b, their paternal ancestress, claimed descent from Alexander the Great.\n\nMost of the incidents of her career are given in the Introduction to this book, and her remarkable character is exhibited there. Bad\u0101yuni calls her Wali-ni\u2019am\u0101t, and says she was known by this name. This may be a tribute to her pre-eminence in character and action and also to the fact of her belonging to an older generation than Akbar\u2019s, under whom he wrote. The elder men of royal birth were Lords and the elder women Ladies of Beneficence in those days.\n\nGul-badan, 65a, 75b.\nAkbar-n\u0101ma, Bib.

Rash., E. & R., 89, 99.\n\nLXXXVII. Is\u0101n-daulat Kh\u0101nam and Begam Q\u016bch\u012bn Mughal.\n\nHer name takes several forms. The B\u0101bar-n\u0101ma, Turk\u012b text (B.M. Or. Add. 26,324), has a clearly pointed Ish\u0101n; Ilminsky has Is\u0101n passim. An early Persian MS. (B.M. Or. 3,714) has Is\u0101n and Is\u0101n.\n\nThe Memoirs have Is\u0101n in all but two instances (p. 12), where Ais is used. But Mr. Erskine\u2019s Persian text (B.M. Add. 26,200), which is presumably his authority, can (I venture to think, after comparing the words he renders Ais with those he renders Is\u0101n) yield Is\u0101n in all places. Where he reads Ais (pp. 10 and 141) the n\u016bn is not dotted; the letters closely correspond with those where it is dotted, and where he reads Is\u0101n.\n\nThe T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-rashid\u012b (B.M. Or. 157) writes Is\u0101n. The weight of authority is in favour of Is\u0101n.\n\nIs\u0101n-daulat was B\u0101bar\u2019s maternal grandmother and a daughter of M\u012br Sh\u016br-\u2018al\u012b Beg Q\u016bch\u012bn (Kunj\u012b), chief of the Sagharichi tum\u0101n (10,000) of the Q\u016bch\u012bn Mughals.\n\nShe married Y\u016bnas Kh\u0101n Chaghat\u0101\u012b Mughal when he was forty-one years old. He was born in 818H. (1415-16), so that the date of her marriage is, approximately, 1456. At this time Y\u016bnas was made Great Kh\u0101n of the Mughals.\n\nIs\u0101n-daulat bore three daughters, who were named Mihr-nig\u0101r, Q\u016b\u1e6d-liq-nig\u0101r, and Kh\u016bb-nig\u0101r. She had many brothers, of whom three, Sh\u012bram, Maz\u012bd, and\n\u02bfAl\u012b-dost, took leading parts in B\u0101bar\u2019s affairs. Her chief co-wife was Sh\u0101h Begam Badakhsh\u012b.\n\nShe shared the vicissitudes of her remarkable husband\u2019s remarkable career for some thirty years; nursed him through two years of paralytic helplessness till his death in 892H. (1487) at the age of seventy-four, and survived him about eighteen years.\n\nFour times at least she fell into the hands of an enemy:\n\n(1) In K\u0101shghar, cir. 860H. (1455-56), when Mihr-nig\u0101r was an infant at the breast and when she was returned in safety to her husband.\n\n(2) In T\u0101shkand in 877H. (1472-73), when Y\u016bnas had gone to buy barley at a time of dearth in Mughal-ist\u0101n. It was then that there occurred the well-known episode which shows Is\u0101n-daulat\u2019s high spirit and decision of character and which is briefly narrated in the Introduction (p. 68). She was returned with honour to her husband.\n\n(3) In Andij\u0101n in 903H. (1497-98), when the town was taken from her grandson B\u0101bar by his kinsfolk. She was sent after him in safety to Khojand, and from there went on to the protection of her third daughter\u2019s home in K\u0101shghar.\n\n(4) At Samarqand in 906H. (1500-1), when the town was taken by Shaib\u0101n\u012b. She remained behind when B\u0101bar left the place, and rejoined him in a few months with his \u2018family, heavy baggage, and a few lean and hungry followers.\u2019\n\nIn the eighth year of her widowhood (900H.) she was guiding B\u0101bar\u2019s affairs with decision and sense in Andij\u0101n. He says that few women equalled her for sagacity, far-sight and good judgment, and that many important affairs were carried out by her counsel.\n\nNews of her death reached B\u0101bar in K\u0101bul early in 911H. (June, 1505), during the forty days\u2019 mourning for his mother.\n\nTwo slight records of her remain for mention.\nDesert-born and of a tribe which clamoured against settled life, she yet had a garden-house at Andij\u0101n. She reared a half-sister of B\u0101bar, Y\u0101dg\u0101r, daughter of Agh\u0101 \u0101gh\u0101cha.\n\nMems., 10, 12, 16, 27, 58, 59, 100, 111, 169.\nT\u0101r.

Khadija Begam.\n\nPresumably she was named after Mu\u1e25ammad\u2019s first wife.\n\nShe was first a slave\\(^1\\) of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Ab\u016b-sa\u02bf\u012bd Mirz\u0101, and upon his death in 873H. (1469) she betook herself to Har\u0101t and there became the wife of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n \u1e24usain B\u0101yqra.\n\nShe had a daughter, known as \u0100q Begam, by Ab\u016b-sa\u02bf\u012bd, and two sons, Sh\u0101h Gharib and Muzaffar \u1e24usain, by her marriage with \u1e24usain.\n\nHers is an instance where the conferring of a title is mentioned. B\u0101bar says that \u1e24usain was passionately fond of her and that he raised her to the rank of begam; also that she managed him entirely. To her are attributed the intrigues and rebellion which ruined \u1e24usain\u2019s family. She acquired more influence than any other of his wives, and it was consequently round her surviving son Muzaffar \u1e24usain, that adherents gathered after his father\u2019s death. She forced on the joint-kingship which excited B\u0101bar\u2019s ridicule. Mirz\u0101 Haidar when speaking of the death of Jah\u0101ng\u012br M\u012br\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b, said that he was generally reported to have been poisoned in his wine by Khad\u012bja Begam after her old fashion.\n\nIn 912H. (1506-7) B\u0101bar saw her in Har\u0101t, and he was there unlawfully entertained by her at a wine-party. When Shaib\u0101n\u012b conquered the city in 913H. she was cast down from her high estate and given up to be plundered, and was treated as one of Shaib\u0101n\u012b\u2019s meanest slaves.\n\nMems., 179, 182, 183, 198, 204, 223.\nT\u0101r.

Khadija-sult\u0101n Begam Chaghat\u0101\u012b Mughal.\n\nFourth daughter of Sult\u0101n Ahmad Kh\u0101n Chaghat\u0101\u012b. After her father\u2019s death in 909H. (1503-4), Mirz\u0101 Ab\u0101-bakr Dughl\u0101t took possession of his capital, Aksu, in Fargh\u0101na, and with it of Khadija-sult\u0101n, then a child. He however, says Mirz\u0101 Haidar, treated her kindly and when she was of age, he gave her in marriage to his son Jah\u0101ng\u012br who was her second cousin. She accompanied her husband to her full-brother Sa\u02bf\u012bd\u2019s court, shortly after 920H. (1514), and while in K\u0101shghar, Jah\u0101ng\u012br was murdered by an unknown hand, in Yang\u012b-his\u0101r. She then remained, respected and honoured, in her brother Sa\u02bf\u012bd\u2019s family circle. In 923H. (1517) she was married to Sh\u0101h Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n Chaghat\u0101\u012b, a grandson of Sult\u0101n Ma\u1e25m\u016bd Kh\u0101n, through Mu\u1e25ammad, the only son of Ma\u1e25m\u016bd who survived the massacre of sult\u0101ns by Shaib\u0101n\u012b. The marriage of one of Khadija\u2019s brothers, Aiman, was celebrated at the same time.\n\nWhen Rash\u012bd succeeded his father Sa\u02bf\u012bd, in K\u0101shghar (939H.\u2014July, 1533) Khadija was badly treated by him. She was then ill and confined to bed, but Rash\u012bd banished her and her children and made her start on the weary journey for Badakhsh\u0101n. She died on the road after much hardship of travel. She left four children, Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl, Ish\u0101q, Ya\u02bfq\u016bb, and Mu\u1e25tarima. They went on to K\u0101bul, and were there received with fatherly kindness by their uncle, Is\u0101n-tim\u016br.\n\nT\u0101r. Rash., E. & R., 161, 329, 352, 382, 451.\n\nXCIII.

Kh\u0101n-z\u0101da Begam B\u0101yqr\u0101.** (No. 16.)\n\nThe kh\u0101n-born princess; Turk\u012b *kh\u0101n*, and Pers. *z\u0101da*, born.\n\nGul-badan says she is a daughter of Sult\u0101n Mas\u02bf\u016bd M\u012brz\u0101 *Mir\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b*, and through a daughter grandchild of P\u0101yanda Mu\u1e25ammad (*sic*) Sult\u0101n Begam, paternal great-aunt of Hum\u0101y\u016bn. B\u0101bar names no such marriage of a daughter of P\u0101yanda. \u2018The second of the daughters [of P\u0101yanda] was K\u012bchak Begam [whose name is probably a sobriquet]. Sult\u0101n Mas\u02bf\u016bd M\u012brz\u0101 was extremely attached to her, but whatever efforts he made, P\u0101yanda-sult\u0101n Begam, having an aversion to him, would not consent to the match. She was afterwards\u2019 (Turk\u012b *s\u016bngr\u0101*, P. de C. *dans la suite*) \u2018married to Mull\u0101 Khw\u0101ja.\u2019\n\nA daughter of \u1e24usain B\u0101yqr\u0101 and of B\u0101b\u0101 \u0101gh\u0101cha, whose name was Sa\u02bf\u0101dat-bakht and title Begam Sult\u0101n, was married to Mas\u02bf\u016bd after his blinding. Her daughter might be fitly described as of inferior rank to the great begams. Such a description is given by B\u0101bar of \u2018Kh\u0101n-z\u0101da, daughter of Sult\u0101n Mas\u02bf\u016bd M\u012brz\u0101.\u2019 \u1e24usain and P\u0101yanda\u2019s daughter would certainly rank as equal in birth to the daughters of Ab\u016b-sa\u02bf\u012bd, since she was a full T\u012bm\u016brid.\n\nThe \u2018extreme attachment\u2019 of Mas\u02bf\u016bd to K\u012bchak fits Musalm\u0101n marriage better than Musalm\u0101n courtship. It may be that, spite of P\u0101yanda\u2019s opposition, Mas\u02bf\u016bd married K\u012bchak. The \u2018afterwards\u2019 of the Memoirs (*supra*) and the *de la suite* of Pavet de Courteille seem to demand some more definite antecedent than\nMas'\u016bd's attachment. Moreover, this presumably persisted with his wish to marry K\u012bchak.\n\nDid he marry K\u012bchak, and was she divorced after his blinding or at some other time, and then was Sa'\u0101dat-bakht given to him?\n\nMems., 181, 182, 387.\nGul-badan, 24b.\n\nXCIX. Kh\u0101n-z\u0101da Begam M\u012br\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b.\n\nDaughter of 'Umar Shaikh M\u012brz\u0101 M\u012br\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b and of Q\u016bt-liq-nig\u0101r Kh\u0101nam; full-sister of B\u0101bar and five years his senior. Eldest of her father's daughters. She is recorded as thrice married: first, to Shaib\u0101n\u012b in 1501 (907H.); secondly, to a man of inferior rank, Sayyid Hada; and, thirdly, to Mahdi Mu\u1e25ammad Khw\u0101ja,\u00b9 son of M\u016bsa Khw\u0101ja. One child of hers is recorded, Shaib\u0101n\u012b's son, Khurr\u0101m-sh\u0101h Sult\u0101n.\n\nShe was born circa 1478 (883H.). This is known from the statement of her brother that she was five years his senior. In 1501 (907H.) she was married by Shaib\u0101n\u012b when he captured Samarqand from B\u0101bar. Gul-badan makes the marriage a condition of Shaib\u0101n\u012b's peace with B\u0101bar; \u1e24aidar says she was given in exchange for B\u0101bar's life, and \u1e2a\u0101fi Kh\u0101n, as a ransom (ba tar\u012bq-i-faida). She was in Shaib\u0101n\u012b's power and could have been married without consent of B\u0101bar. As in 1501 she was twenty-three years old, she had almost certainly been married before, possibly to Mahdi. Her marriage arrangements with Shaib\u0101n\u012b might include the divorce which the Musalm\u0101n law requires. B\u0101bar does not go into details as to the marriage; he says she fell into Shaib\u0101n\u012b's hands. Presumably as himself of Tim\u016brid birth, Shaib\u0101n\u012b would treat a Tim\u016brid woman with respectful forms even when she was spoil of battle. To marry Kh\u0101n-z\u0101da, he divorced her maternal aunt, Mihr-nig\u0101r Chaghat\u0101i.\n\n\u00b9 Cf. Appendix B., Mahdi Khw\u0101ja.\nKh\u0101n-z\u0101da\u2019s son by Shaib\u0101n\u012b, Khurram-sh\u0101h, died a young man. Shaib\u0101n\u012b divorced her because she leaned to her brother\u2019s side in disputed matters. He then gave her in marriage to a certain Sayyid Hada, who fell in the battle of Merv with Shaib\u0101n\u012b himself (1510).\n\nIn 1511 and at the age of thirty-three, she was returned to B\u0101bar by Sh\u0101h Ism\u0101\u02bfil. At what date she married Mahd\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Khw\u0101ja I am not able to say. It is probable that the marriage would take place within no long time after her return. As Mahd\u012b is never described by B\u0101bar in any way (as is his custom when a new actor comes upon the scene of his Memoirs), it is probable that Mahd\u012b\u2019s joining B\u0101bar and his marriage with Kh\u0101n-z\u0101da took place in the decade 1509-19, of which no record is known to survive.\u00b9 Mahd\u012b was with B\u0101bar in 1519 (925H.), and is frequently mentioned subsequently.\n\nThere are many references to Kh\u0101n-z\u0101da by Gul-badan who frequently calls her Dearest Lady (\u0101k\u0101jan\u0101m). She died at Qabal-chak in 1545 (952H.), aged about sixty-seven years, and after a life full of sorrows and chagrins.\n\nGul-badan, 3b, 15b, 18b, 23b, 24b, 27b, 28b, 50b, 62b, 63a.\nMems., 10, 98, 241 (Supplement).\nT\u0101r.

M\u0101ham Begam: \u0101k\u0101 and \u0101k\u0101m (lady and my lady).\n\nThe word M\u0101ham is explained by Mr. Erskine (who did not know Gul-badan\u2019s book) as B\u0101bar\u2019s name of endearment for his favourite wife, and as meaning \u2018my moon.\u2019 Mr. Schuyler also translates it by the same words. He says that a woman who was shot for political offences in Bukh\u0101r\u0101 was known as \u2018My moon (M\u0101ham) of Keninghez.\u2019\n\nBut many M\u0101hams are chronicled, and not only B\u0101bar gives the name to Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s mother; Gul-badan speaks frequently of \u2018my lady who was M\u0101ham Begam,\u2019 and M\u0101ham seems to be her personal name. It is used at least once as a man\u2019s. (Akbar-n\u0101ma, I. 320, M\u0101ham \u2018Al\u012b Quli Kh\u0101n.)\n\nWhether m\u0101ham is to be classed with sult\u0101nam, kh\u0101nam, begam, sh\u0101ham, I am unable to say.\n\nSir Douglas Forsyth (Mission to Yarkand, 84) translates kh\u0101nam and begam by my lord and my chief. But neither is a domestic word; both are in common use in the sources to designate, for general readers, the wives or daughters of kh\u0101ns and begs, or princes. Sult\u0101nam also is a common title, and from Gul-badan\u2019s use of it does not appear to be a personal name, but to answer to sult\u0101n as kh\u0101nam to kh\u0101n, etc.\n\nAgainst reading kh\u0101nam as my lady, with a sense of possession or admission of superiority (as is done by Sir Douglas Forsyth), there are the Turk\u012b words formed from it, viz., kh\u0101nam-\u0101l\u012b, honeysuckle, and kh\u0101nam-bujak\u012b, ladybird. Sh\u0101ham, which has the appearance of being formed from sh\u0101h like the others by the suffix am or im, is used both for man and woman. Sh\u012bram occurs as a man\u2019s name.\n\nM\u0101ham was a wife of whom it was said that she was to B\u0101bar what \u2018\u0100yisha was to Mu\u1e25ammad, and she was Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s mother. Gul-badan mentions her often, yet no one of the numerous sources I have consulted, sets down her family or the name of her father.\n\nAt one time it appeared to me probable that she was a Begchik Mughal, because B\u0101bar calls Y\u0101dg\u0101r Begchik, \u1e6daghai when speaking of him in connection with Hum\u0101y\u016bn. Further consideration led to the abandonment of the theory.\n\nUncle Y\u0101dg\u0101r, Uncle \u2018Al\u012b, and Uncle Ibr\u0101h\u012bm (Chap\u016bk, slashed-face) are named as being three of the eight brothers or half-brothers of Gul-rukh, the mother\nof K\u0101mr\u0101n; and Bega (\u1e24aji) Begam is the daughter of Uncle Y\u0101dg\u0101r.\n\nAmongst these eight Begchiks I do not find one named Uncle Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Al\u012b, and there is a good deal to lead one to regard a certain Khw\u0101ja Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Al\u012b \u1e6dagh\u0101t as being M\u0101ham\u2019s brother.\n\nHe was associated with Khost, and it is on record that Hum\u0101y\u016bn visited his maternal grandparents (nanah\u0101) in Khost. The Begchiks do not seem to have been connected with Khost. B\u0101bar speaks frequently of Khw\u0101ja Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Al\u012b as being employed in the government of Khost (925H.); as coming from Khost for orders, etc., and the m\u012br-z\u0101das of Khost also are recorded as visiting the court. One of M\u0101ham\u2019s children was born in Khost.\n\nB\u0101bar frequently mentions an \u2018Abdu-l-mal\u016bk Khost\u012b, and he may be a connection of M\u0101ham. He, however, appears as Khost\u012b, Khwast\u012b, Qast\u012b, q\u016brch\u012b, Q\u016brch\u012bn, and without a more complete good Turki text no opinion can be formed as to his identity.\n\nGul-badan says that \u0100k\u0101 (M\u0101ham) was related to the owners of the New Year\u2019s Garden in K\u0101bul, and this was made by Ulugh Beg K\u0101bul\u012b M\u012br\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u016b.\n\nAb\u016bl-fa\u1e93l says M\u0101ham was of a noble Khur\u0101s\u0101n family, related to Sult\u0101n Husain M\u012brz\u0101 (B\u0101yqra), and, like \u1e24am\u012bda-b\u0101n\u016b Begam, was of the line of Shaikh A\u1e25mad J\u0101m\u012b (az d\u016bdman-i-a\u02bfy\u0101n wa ashr\u0101f-i-Khur\u0101s\u0101n and, wa ba Sult\u0101n Husain M\u012brz\u0101 nisbat-i-khwesh d\u0101rand. Perhaps nisbat-i-khwesh implies blood-relationship on the father\u2019s side.\n\nGul-badan speaks of M\u0101ham\u2019s Mughal servants, but a Chaghat\u0101\u016b, a Begchik, a Q\u016bch\u012bn is also a Mughal, and B\u0101bar often sinks the divisional tribe-name in the general one, Mughal (e.g., Mem. 9 and 21).\n\nSome considerations suggest that M\u0101ham was a Dughl\u0101t Mughal, and of the family of \u2018Abdu-l-qad\u016bs, but no valid opinion can be formed until a text as good as the Elphinstone is available for guidance.\nB\u0101bar married M\u0101ham in Har\u0101t when he visited that city after Sul\u1e6d\u0101n \u1e24usain Mirz\u0101\u2019s death, and in 912H. (1506). Hum\u0101y\u016bn was born on March 6, 1508 (Z\u016b\u2019l-qa\u2018da 4th, 913H.). Four other children were born to her, and all died in infancy. They were B\u0101r-bul, Mihr-jah\u0101n, Is\u0101n-daulat and F\u0101r\u016bq.\n\nThe events of her career are detailed in the Introduction to this volume and in Gul-badan Begam\u2019s book.\n\nMems., 250, 405, 412, 428, 428 n..\nGul-badan, 4a, 6b, 7a, 8b, 11b, 13b, 14b, 16a, 16b, 17a, 18b, 21a and b, 22a and b, 23a and b, 24b.\nAkbar-n\u0101ma, Bib.

There is a Turki word j\u016bj\u016bq, but its meaning of sweet-savoured is less appropriate for a woman's name than a word which, spite of vowel variation it seems safer to take from the Persian; viz. chachak, a rose, and chachak, chuchuk, a lovely cheek, a mole.\n\nDaughter of M\u012brz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Muq\u012bm Argh\u016bn and of Bibi Zar\u012bf Kh\u0101t\u016bn; wife (1) of B\u0101bar's k\u016bkalt\u0101sh Q\u0101sim; (2) of Sh\u0101h \u1e24asan Argh\u016bn of Sind (died 963H.); (3) of \u2018\u012as\u0101 Tarkh\u0101n Argh\u016bn of Tatta and Sind.\n\nBy Q\u0101sim, she was mother of N\u0101hid Begam and by Sh\u0101h \u1e24asan of his only child, Ch\u016bchak or M\u0101h-ch\u016bchak, K\u0101mr\u0101n's wife.\n\nShe had an interesting story which Mr. Erskine tells at length.

She appears to have married a man of high rank; perhaps K\u016bch\u016bm (Q\u016bch-kunj\u012b) Kh\u0101n who was Kh\u0101q\u0101n of his tribe from 1510 to 1530, or his son and successor (ruled from 1530 to 1533). She had a son Pul\u0101d whom B\u0101bar mentions as fighting with 'Q\u016bch-kunj\u012b' and his son Ab\u016b-sa'\u012bd Uzbeg at J\u0101m (1528).\n\nThe Q\u016bch-kunj\u012b was the tribe of Is\u0101n-daulat.\n\nK\u016bch\u016bm, Ab\u016b-sa'\u012bd, Mihr-b\u0101n\u016b, and Pul\u0101d sent ambassadors and messengers to B\u0101bar in the same year, and B\u0101bar mentions his return gifts with quaint particularity. The envoys were entertained at a feast by him on December 12th, 1528 (935H.).\n\nMems., 10, 390, 395, 397, 399.\nT\u0101r. Rash., E. & R., s.n.

(early in July, 1500) she was captured by Shaib\u0101n\u012b and married by him. In 906H. (1500-1) she was divorced when he wished to marry Kh\u0101n-z\u0101da, her niece. She then stayed awhile in Samarqand. In 907H. (1501-2) she went to T\u0101shkand and joined\nthe large family party which assembled there. (Mems. 99.) In 911H. (middle of 1505) she came to K\u0101bul with other kinsfolk, soon after the death of her grandmother (Is\u0101n) and of her father, and during the ceremonial mourning of B\u0101bar for his mother. \u2018Our grief broke out afresh,\u2019 he writes.\n\nMirz\u0101 Haidar gives a pleasant account of the welcome she accorded her generous and kindly nephew B\u0101bar in 912H. (1506-7), when he put down Kh\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s (Wais) rebellion in K\u0101bul: \u2018The Emperor leapt up and embraced his beloved aunt with every manifestation of affection. The kh\u0101nam said to him: \u201cYour children, wives, and household are longing to see you. I give thanks that I have been permitted to see you again. Rise up and go to your family in the castle. I too am going thither.\u201d\n\nIn 913H. (1507), when Kh\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 set out for Badakhsh\u0101n with his mother, Sh\u0101h Begam, to try his fortunes in her father\u2019s ancient lands, Mihr-nig\u0101r also \u2018took a fancy to go. It would have been better and more becoming,\u2019 writes B\u0101bar, \u2018for her to remain with me. I was her nearest relation. But however much I dissuaded her, she continued obstinate and also set out for Badakhsh\u0101n.\n\nMihr-nig\u0101r rued her self-will. She and Sh\u0101h Begam were captured on their way to Qila-\u1e93afar by one of Ab\u016b-bakr Dughl\u0101t\u2019s \u2018marauding bands,\u2019 and \u2018in the prisons of that wretched miscreant they departed from this perishable world.\u2019\n\nMems., 12, 22, 99, 169, 232.\nT\u0101r.

The alliance was the sign and seal of amity between him and her tribe. A charming account of her and her marriage is given in the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-h\u0101fiz-i-rahmat-kh\u0101n\u012b, and Mr. Beveridge has translated it in full under the title \u2018An Afghan Legend,\u2019 so that it need not be reproduced here.\n\nGul-badan never gives the name Mub\u0101rika (Blessed Damozel) as that of the Afgh\u0101n lady (Afgh\u0101n\u012b \u0101gh\u0101cha) whom she so frequently and pleasantly mentions. Hafiz Muhammad (l.c.) says that Mub\u0101rika was much beloved by B\u0101bar, and this is borne out by the fact that she was one of the small and select party of ladies who were the first to join him in India. She went there, it is safe to infer, with M\u0101ham and Gul-badan in 1529.\n\nShe bore no child, and this misfortune Hafiz Muhammad attributes to the envy of other wives who administered drugs to deprive her of motherhood and weaken her husband\u2019s affection.\n\nShe died early in Akbar\u2019s reign.\nA brother of Mub\u0101rika, named M\u012br Jam\u0101l, accompanied B\u0101bar to Hindust\u0101n in 1525, and rose to high office under Hum\u0101y\u016bn and Akbar. Hind\u0101l had a favourite follower of this name who passed, on his death, into Akbar\u2019s service.

Rabi\u02bfa-sul\u1e6d\u0101n Begam B\u0101ygr\u0101 and Bedka Begam\nB\u0101ygr\u0101.\n\nThese two names may indicate the same person.\n\nThe Memoirs (176 and 177) say that Sul\u1e6d\u0101n \u1e24usain\nM\u012brz\u0101 B\u0101ygr\u0101 had two full-sisters, \u0100ka and Bedka,\nand that Bedka married Ahm\u0101d H\u0101ji Tarkh\u0101n, and\nhad two sons who served Sul\u1e6d\u0101n \u1e24usain.\n\nThese statements are contained also in the Turk\u012b\ntexts (B.M. Add. 26,324, and Ilminsky), and also in\na considerable number of good Persian texts in the\nBritish Museum and Bodleian.:\nThere is, however, this difference of statement. The Turki texts write: *Bedka Begam ham m\u012brz\u0101 n\u012bnak \u0101ik\u0101-ch\u012b s\u012b \u0101d\u012b*. P. de C. translates: *\u00e9tait aussi l'a\u00een\u00e9e du m\u012brz\u0101*. The Persian texts have: *Bedka Begam ki khw\u0101har-i-khurd m\u012brz\u0101 b\u016bd*; and from this Mr. Erskine translates: ... *the m\u012brz\u0101's younger sister*.\n\nThe Turki, it should be observed, uses of \u0100ka precisely the same word as of Bedka, *\u0101ik\u0101-ch\u012b s\u012b*.\n\nIt may be right to regard Bedka as the younger of the two sisters of the m\u012brz\u0101, and not as the sister younger than the m\u012brz\u0101.\n\nTo pass now to what has led me to make a tentative identification of Bedka with Rab\u012b\u02bfa-sult\u0101n.\n\nThe Memoirs (181) mention Rab\u012b\u02bfa-sult\u0101n as the younger sister of the m\u012brz\u0101 (\u1e24usain) and as having two sons, B\u0101bar and Mur\u0101d who were given in marriage to two daughters of \u1e24usain.\n\nThe Turki texts do not describe Rab\u012b\u02bfa-sult\u0101n in any way, or say that she was \u1e24usain\u2019s sister. They simply mention the marriages.\n\nThe Persian texts say of \u1e24usain\u2019s two daughters (Bega and \u0100gh\u0101): *ba pisar\u0101n-i-khw\u0101har-i-khurd-i-khudr\u0101 Rab\u012b\u02bfa-sult\u0101n Begam, B\u0101bar M\u012brz\u0101 wa Sult\u0101n Mur\u0101d M\u012brz\u0101, d\u0101d\u0101 b\u016bland*.\n\nThe Persian texts which state that Rab\u012b\u02bfa-sult\u0101n was \u1e24usain\u2019s own sister, have greater authority than most translations can claim for such additional information as is here given, because the Persian translation of the *T\u016bz\u016bk-i-b\u0101bari* was made in a court circle and at a date when such additional statements were likely to be known to many living persons.\n\n\u1e24usain *may* have had a younger and half-sister, but the words in the Persian texts which are used of Rab\u012b\u02bfa-sult\u0101n are those used of Bedka, and they are more applicable to a full than a half sister.\n\nThe \u0100ka of the passage in which Bedka is mentioned has no personal name recorded. Bedka may be a word of the same class as *\u0101ka*, i.e., a title or\nsobriquet, and Rab\u012b'a-sult\u0101n may be the personal name of Bedka. Perhaps the word Bedka is Bega.\n\nThe facts of Bedka's descent are as follows: she was a daughter of Man\u1e63\u016br M\u012brz\u0101 B\u0101yqra and of F\u012broza Begam M\u012br\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b, and thus doubly a T\u012bm\u016brid. She was full-sister of B\u0101yqra and \u1e24usain M\u012brz\u0101s and of \u0100ka Begam. She married A\u1e25mad Kh\u0101n H\u0101ji Tarkh\u0101n, and had two sons whose names (if Bedka be Rab\u012b'a-sult\u0101n) were B\u0101bar and Mur\u0101d and who married two of her nieces, Bega and \u0100gh\u0101.\n\nMems., 176, 177, 181.\nIlminsky, 203, 204, 208.\nB.M.

Sal\u012bma-sult\u0101n Begam Chaq\u0101ni\u0101n\u012b.\n\nDaughter of M\u012brz\u0101 N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Chaq\u0101ni\u0101n\u012b and of a daughter of B\u0101bar, as to whose name the sources ring changes upon the rose. She appears as Gul-rang (B. and H. s.n.), Gul-barg, Gul-rukh. As her mother was a full Turkom\u0101n or Turk by descent, it has occurred to me that she may have borne a Turki name, and that the various forms it assumes in the Persian may have their origin in this.\n\nAs to her maternal parentage there are difficulties. From the Ma\u02bf\u0101sir-i-ra\u1e25\u012bm\u012b, under 1024H., the following information is obtained. P\u0101sh\u0101 Begam Bah\u0101rl\u016b Turkom\u0101n married (873H., 1469) as her second husband, Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd M\u012brz\u0101 Mir\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b. By him she had three daughters and one son: Bayasanghar (b. 882H., 1477). One daughter whose name was S\u0101lha-sult\u0101n Begam, married B\u0101bar and bore him a daughter, Gul-rukh (sic). Gul-rukh married N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Chaq\u0101ni\u0101n\u012b, and their daughter was Sal\u012bma-sult\u0101n Begam who married first, Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n-i-khan\u0101n, and secondly, the Emperor Akbar.\n\nAb\u016b\u02bel-fa\u1e93l (Bib. Ind. ed., II. 65) adds the particular that Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u012b gave his daughter Gul-barg (sic), to N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn because a daughter of Mahm\u016bd and P\u0101sh\u0101 had been given to N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn\u2019s grandfather Khw\u0101ja \u1e24asan, known as Khw\u0101ja-z\u0101da Chaq\u0101ni\u0101n\u012b. He also states that Sal\u012bma-sult\u0101n Begam was the issue of Gul-barg\u2019s marriage.\n\nIn the Memoirs, as we have them, there is no mention of S\u0101lha-sult\u0101n nor of N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn\u2019s marriage with a daughter of B\u0101bar. Yet Ab\u016b\u02bel-fa\u1e93l states that Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u012b arranged Gul-barg\u2019s marriage. The first omission is the more remarkable because B\u0101bar (Mems., 30) states that P\u0101sh\u0101 had three daughters. He does not give their names, and specifies the\nmarriage of the eldest only. On the same page he tells of his marriage with S\u0101lha\u2019s half-sister Zainab and of her death. The omission is remarkable and appears to have no good ground, since he chronicles his other Tim\u016brid marriages. Of P\u0101sh\u0101\u2019s daughters it may be noted here that one married Malik Mu\u1e25ammad Mir\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b, another Khw\u0101ja \u1e24asan Chaq\u0101nt\u0101n\u012b, and the third, B\u0101bar.\n\nIt appears to me tolerably clear that B\u0101bar\u2019s marriage with S\u0101lha-sult\u0101n took place at a date which falls in a gap of the Memoirs, i.e., from 1511 to 1519. This is the period which contains the exile from K\u0101bul after the Mughal rebellion.\n\nNot only does B\u0101bar omit S\u0101lha-sult\u0101n\u2019s name and his marriage with her (Mems., 30), but Gul-badan is also silent as to name, marriage and child of S\u0101lha-sult\u0101n. This silence is in every way remarkable. She enumerates her father\u2019s children and gives their mothers\u2019 names, and she enumerates some of his wives in more places than one. From her lists a Tim\u016brid wife cannot have escaped, and especially one whose child became the mother of Gul-badan\u2019s associate Salima-sult\u0101n.\n\nAn explanation of Gul-badan\u2019s silence and also of a part of B\u0101bar\u2019s has suggested itself to me; it is conjectural merely and hypothetical. The absence of mention of S\u0101lha-sult\u0101n and of her child suggests that she appears under another name in Gul-badan\u2019s list of her father\u2019s children and their mothers. She may be Gul-badan\u2019s own mother, Dil-d\u0101r Begam without undue wresting of known circumstantial witness.\n\nThe principal difficulty in the way of this identification is Ab\u016b\u2019l-fa\u017cl\u2019s statement that N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn\u2019s marriage was made by Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u012b, whereas Gul-badan states that her father arranged two Chaghat\u0101i marriages for her sisters.\n\nIf we might read Jannat-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b (Hum\u0101y\u016bn) for Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u012b much would fall into place; the\nmarriage with N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn could be a re-marriage of Gul-chihra who was widowed in 1533, and of whose remarriage nothing is recorded until her brief political alliance with \u2018Abbas Uzbeg in 1549. It is probable that she remarried in the interval.\n\nTo pass on to recorded incidents of Sal\u012bma-sult\u0101n\u2019s life:\n\nThere is an entry in Hind\u0101l\u2019s guest-list which may indicate her presence.\n\nShe accompanied \u1e24amida-b\u0101n\u016b and Gul-badan to Hind\u016bstan in 964H. (1557), and she was married at Jalindhar shortly after \u0160afar 15th, 965H. (middle of December, 1557) to Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n-i-kh\u0101n\u0101n. It is said that the marriage excited great interest at Court. It united two streams of descent from \u2018Ali-shukr Beg Bal\u0101rl\u016b Turkom\u0101n. Sal\u012bma-sult\u0101n was a Tim\u016brid through B\u0101bar, one of her grandfathers, and through Mahm\u016bd, one of her great-grandfathers.\n\nA few words must be said about her age at the time of her marriage, because the question has been raised through Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s statement that she died at the age of sixty in 1021H., and commented upon by the Darb\u0101r-i-akbar\u012b. If Jah\u0101ng\u012br gives her age correctly she must have been born in 961H., and this would make her a child of five when she married Bair\u0101m, and needs her betrothal by her father to Bair\u0101m to date from babyhood.\n\nThe Darb\u0101r-i-akbar\u012b says that it is clear from Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s statement of her age at death that she was married to Bair\u0101m \u0113tat. 5, and that her memory is thus cleared from the reproach of two marriages!\n\nWhatever is concealed in Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s \u2018sixty,\u2019 nothing is said to indicate that he desired to bring Sal\u012bma-sult\u0101n into the circle of Hind\u016b propriety. He may have had the wish; he was a Hind\u016b mother\u2019s son. The comment of the modern author of the Darb\u0101r-i-\nakbar\u012b witnesses to the Hinduizing action to which Moslim custom and thought have submitted. Adult remarriage was no reproach to Isl\u0101m in Sal\u012bma\u2019s day.\n\nIt does not, however, seem correct to accept Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s statement that Sal\u012bma-sult\u0101n was sixty only at death To have betrothed her as a baby and to have married her to a man of, at least, middle-age at five, is not in harmony with the Mu\u1e25ammad custom of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s day. Moreover, Jah\u0101ng\u012br himself speaks of her as married (kad-khud\u0101) to Bair\u0101m. She is said by Ab\u016b\u2019l-fa\u017cl to have been betrothed (n\u0101mz\u0101d) by Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and married (sipurdan) by Akbar to Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n.\n\nBad\u0101yuni\u2019s words indicate adult and not child marriage; s\u0101biq\u0101 dar \u1e25ab\u0101la-i-Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n-i-kh\u0101n\u0101n b\u016bd, b\u0101d az\u0101n dakhil-i-karam-i-p\u0101dshah\u012b sh\u016bd.\n\nAfter the murder of Bair\u0101m in 968H. Sal\u012bma-sult\u0101n was married by Akbar. She was probably a few years his senior.\n\nIn 983H. she made her pilgrimage with Gul-badan. Particulars of the expedition are given in the Introduction to this volume.\n\nHer name appears in the histories as a reader, a poet who wrote under the pseudonym of makhyf\u012b, and as pleading with Akbar for Sal\u012bm\u2019s forgiveness.\n\nHer death is chronicled by Jah\u0101ng\u012br who heard of it on Z\u016bl-qa\u2018da 2nd, 1021H. (December 15th, 1612). He gives particulars of her birth and descent, and of her marriages; and he states that she was sixty at the time of her death. By his orders her body was laid in a garden which she herself had made.\n\nJah\u0101ng\u012br praises her both for her natural qualities and her acquirements. She creates an impression of herself as a charming and cultivated woman.\n\nGul-badan, (?)26a.\nAkbar-n\u0101ma s.n..\nBad\u0101yuni, Lowe, 13, 216, 389.\nT\u0101zik-i-jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b, Sayyid Ahmad, Aligarh, 113.\nKh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n, Bib.

Sh\u0101h Begam Badakhshi.\n\nThe princess of royal blood.\n\nShe was one of six daughters of Sh\u0101h Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad, King of Badakhsh\u0101n, the last of a long line of hereditary rulers of his country who claimed descent from Alexander of Macedon. Her mother was a sister of Sult\u0101n Sanjar Barl\u0101s.\n\nShe was given in marriage to Y\u016bnas Kh\u0101n Chaghat\u0101\u012b and was the mother of Ma\u1e25m\u016bd and A\u1e25mad Kh\u0101ns and of Sult\u0101n-nig\u0101r and Daulat Kh\u0101nams. She was widowed in 892H. (1487), and survived Y\u016bnas more than twenty years.\n\nShe dwelt in Mughalist\u0101n with her elder son, Ma\u1e25m\u016bd, the then Khaq\u0101n of the Mughals, from the time of Y\u016bnas\u2019 death until about 911H. (1505-6). Then \u2018base advisers provoked a quarrel between the mother and son\u2014a son so obedient that he had never even mounted for a ride without her permission. . . . They [the base advisers] decided to send Sh\u0101h Begam to Shah\u012b Beg Kh\u0101n to solicit a country for herself, because she found living in Mughalist\u0101n distasteful. . . .\n\nNow, as the Begam was a very sensible woman, she went under this pretext, and thus left her son before those base advisers could bring about an open rupture, which would have caused endless scandal and reproach to herself. The rumour was that she had gone to entreat Shah\u012b Beg Kh\u0101n while she was really enjoying in Samarqand the company of her children.\u2019 (Tar. Rash, E. & R., 180.)\n\nSh\u0101h\u012b Beg did not permit her to remain in Samarqand but banished her to Khur\u0101s\u0101n. From Khur\u0101s\u0101n she went with other connections and relations to B\u0101bar in K\u0101bul. They arrived early in 911H. (June, 1505), during the ceremonial mourning for B\u0101bar\u2019s mother, Sh\u0101h Begam\u2019s stepdaughter. With Sh\u0101h Begam was \u1e24aidar M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s father and also B\u0101bar\u2019s aunt, Mihr-nig\u0101r. \u1e24aidar says that B\u0101bar gave the party a warm welcome and showed them all possible\nhonour; and that they spent some time in K\u0101bul in the greatest ease and comfort.\n\nB\u0101bar\u2019s kindness fell on ungrateful ground, since in the following year, 912H. (1506-7), Sh\u0101h Begam fomented a rebellion against him in favour of her grandson, M\u012brz\u0101 Kh\u0101n. Haidar says that during B\u0101bar\u2019s absence in Har\u0101t her motherly love (it was grandmotherly) began to burn in her heart, and persuaded her that B\u0101bar was dead, and that room was thus made for M\u012brz\u0101 Kh\u0101n. The story of B\u0101bar\u2019s magnanimity to her when he had put down the rising she had stirred, is well known and is detailed in the histories.\n\nIn 913H. (1507-8) she laid claim to Badakhsh\u0101n, saying that it had been her family\u2019s hereditary kingdom for 3,000 years; that though she, a woman, could not attain to sovereignty, her grandson would not be rejected. B\u0101bar assented to her scheme, and she set off for Badakhsh\u0101n, together with Mihr-nig\u0101r Kh\u0101nam and M\u012brz\u0101 Kh\u0101n.\n\nThe latter went on in advance to Qila\u2019-\u1e93afar. The ladies and their escort were at once attacked and plundered by robber bands in the employ of the ruler of K\u0101shghar, Ab\u0101-bakr Dughl\u0101t, and were by them conveyed to him in K\u0101shghar. They were placed in confinement, and \u2018in the prison of that wicked miscreant they departed from this perishable world\u2019 (cir. 913H.).\n\nMems., 12, 13, 22, 32, 60, 74, 99, 104, 105, 106, 169, 216, 217, 231.\nT\u0101r.

(March, 1469).\n\nB\u0101bar gives an entertaining detail about her married life. Once at Chekm\u0101n her husband was engaged in a battle with her brother Mahm\u016bd. All his ladies except herself alighted from their litters and mounted on horseback, presumably for rapid flight if the day went against Husain. Shahr-b\u0101n\u016b, however, \u2018relying on her brother,\u2019 remained in her litter. This being reported to her husband, he divorced her and married her younger sister, P\u0101yanda-sult\u0101n.\n\nOf her subsequent history nothing seems recorded. (Cf.

Through her son Muhammad she was ancestress of those numerous rebel B\u0101yqr\u0101s whom history knows as \u2018the m\u012brz\u0101s.\u2019\n\nWhen the Uzbegs took Har\u0101t in 1507 (913H.) she went to Khw\u0101rizm, and there her daughter was married. On April 12th, 1519 (Rab\u012b\u2018 II. 12th, 925H.), B\u0101bar records her arrival with her daughter in K\u0101bul. He gave her the Garden of Retirement (Bagh-i-khilvat) for her residence, and waited upon her with the ceremony due to an elder sister. He bowed and she bowed; he advanced, they embraced; and having established this form of greeting, they kept to it.\n\nSult\u0101nam started from K\u0101bul for India in 1527 with a grandson (her sons had six sons), but she died at the Indus and her body was taken back to K\u0101bul for burial.\n\nThere are curious discrepancies of the texts in the passage about Sult\u0101nam which occurs at Mem., 181.\n\nThe first point to note is contained in the words: \u2018Her elder brother gave her in marriage to Sult\u0101n\nWais M\u012brz\u0101, the son of Mi\u0101ng\u012b B\u0101yqr\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101.\u2019 (Mems., 181.)\n\nBar\u0101dar kilanash ba pisar mi\u0101ng\u012b B\u0101yqr\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 Sult\u0101n Wais M\u012brz\u0101 dada b\u016bd.

But she was an only child, and her father was living to act for her. The French version, here as in so many other places, appears to have relied upon Mr. Erskine. The Turk\u012b text appears to yield something more probable, i.e., \u2018His elder brother, B\u0101yqr\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s middle son, Sult\u0101n Wais M\u012brz\u0101...\u2019\n\nMr. Erskine has read mi\u0101ng\u012b as part of B\u0101yqr\u0101\u2019s name.

(No. 12.)\n\nDaughter of Sult\u0101n Ahmad M\u012brz\u0101.\n\nA Sult\u0101nam of this parentage is mentioned by B\u0101bar (Mems., 22), by Haidar (E. & R., s.n.), and by Gulbadan (24b). These appear to be at least two, and perhaps are three women. Their record is as follows:\n\n(1). Sult\u0101nam, fourth daughter of Sult\u0101n Ahmad M\u012brz\u0101. (Mems., 22.) She was the child of Q\u016bt\u016bq (Katak) Begam. She married her cousin \u2018Al\u012b, son of Mahm\u016bd M\u012brz\u0101. \u2018Al\u012b was murdered by Shaib\u0101n\u012b (cf. s.n. Zuhra) in 906H. (July, 1500), and his widow was taken to wife by Shaib\u0101n\u012b\u2019s son, Mu\u1e25ammad T\u012bm\u016br. A third marriage is mentioned by B\u0101bar, viz., to Mahd\u012b Sult\u0101n. By this style the histories mention the Uzbeg chief who was associated with Hamza (Khamza) Sult\u0101n. But this Mahd\u012b was put to death by B\u0101bar in 1511, and T\u012bm\u016br was living in 1512 (918H.). Either Sult\u0101nam was divorced, perhaps to make marriage with some other kinswoman and later captive legal; or Mahd\u012b Sult\u0101n may be the father of \u2018Adil Sult\u0101n; or he may be Mahd\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Khw\u0101ja.\n\n(2). Sult\u0101nam, daughter of Sult\u0101n Ahmad M\u012brz\u0101, married Mu\u1e25ammad Husain Dughl\u0101t in the autumn of 1503. She was given to her husband by Khusrau Sh\u0101h who describes her as daughter of Sult\u0101n Ahmad M\u012brz\u0101 wa p\u0101dsh\u0101h-z\u0101da-i-man, by which Mr. Ross has understood that she was of Khusrau\u2019s \u2018family.\u2019 There was a son, issue of this marriage and named \u2018Abdu-l-l\u0101h.\n\nIt is difficult to regard No. 1 and No. 2 as one woman, both because of their marriage dates and of the circumstance that No. 1 was an Uzbeg captive and No. 2 in Badakhsh\u0101n. B\u0101bar mentions no marriage of a Sult\u0101nam with Mu\u1e25ammad Husain Dughl\u0101t. A surmise\u2014it is nothing more\u2014has occurred to me, namely: No. 2 was married to the Dughl\u0101t m\u012brz\u0101 shortly after the destruction of T\u0101shkend; B\u0101bar\u2019s\nwife '\u0100yisha, third daughter of Sult\u0101n A\u1e25mad M\u012br\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b, had left B\u0101bar shortly before that disaster. She might be Sult\u0101nam No. 2.\n\n(3). Sult\u0101nam, or Sult\u0101n\u012b, daughter of Sult\u0101n A\u1e25mad M\u012brz\u0101, was at the Mystic Feast in 1531. She is said to be the mother of Kil\u0101n Kh\u0101n Begam. This title is not appropriate for the child of any of the marriages mentioned for No. 1 or No. 2. It is quite appropriate for the child of the marriage of Sult\u0101n A\u1e25mad and Q\u016bt\u016bq\u2019s firstborn daughter, Rab\u012b\u2019a-sult\u0101n, because Rab\u012b\u2019a married Sult\u0101n Ma\u1e25m\u016bd Kh\u0101n who was the Elder Kh\u0101n (kil\u0101n) and also the Great Kh\u0101n (Kh\u0101q\u0101n) of the Mughals. Shaib\u0101n\u012b murdered five of Ma\u1e25m\u016bd\u2019s six sons, but probably his girls escaped because of their value as wives.\n\nThe above notes make for the opinion that Sult\u0101nam is a title, and not a name.

Sult\u0101n-nig\u0101r Kh\u0101nam Chaghat\u0101\u012b Mughal.\nDaughter of Y\u016bnas Kh\u0101n Chaghat\u0101\u012b and Sh\u0101h Begam Badakhsh\u012b; wife of Sult\u0101n Ma\u1e25m\u016bd M\u012brz\u0101 M\u012br\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b; mother of Sult\u0101n Wais (Kh\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101); widowed in 900H. (January, 1495).\n\nOn Ma\u1e25m\u016bd\u2019s death in Samarqand she joined her brothers in T\u0101shkand, going off \u2018without giving any notice of her intentions,\u2019 says B\u0101bar. Later on she married Aw\u012bq (Ad\u012bk) Sult\u0101n J\u016bj\u012b, the chief of the Uzbeg Qaz\u0101qs. Her story is somewhat confused in the Memoirs (13 and 14) by a double mention of her\nmarriage to Aw\u012bq. \u1e24aidar M\u012brz\u0101 throws some light, and it seems that when Shaib\u0101n\u012b had murdered her brother, Mahm\u016bd Kh\u0101n, Aw\u012bq left him and joined the Uzbeg Qaz\u0101qs, his own people, and Sult\u0101n-nig\u0101r followed him into Mughalist\u0101n.\n\nShe had two daughters by Aw\u012bq, one of whom married \u2018Abdu-l-l\u0101h Q\u016bch\u012bn and died a young wife, and the other married Rash\u012bd Sult\u0101n Chaghat\u0101\u012b.\n\nOn Aw\u012bq\u2019s death, Sult\u0101n-nig\u0101r was married to his brother Q\u0101sim, presumably in consonance with the Turk\u012b custom of yang-lik.\n\nWith Q\u0101sim\u2019s death, the kh\u0101nship of the Qaz\u0101qs devolved on Sult\u0101n-nig\u0101r\u2019s stepson (i.e., Aw\u012bq\u2019s by a co-wife) named T\u0101hir. \u2018He was,\u2019 says \u1e24aidar, \u2018very much attached to her, and even preferred her to the mother who had given him birth.\u2019\n\nWhat follows is full of colour and feeling. Nig\u0101r-sult\u0101n showed her appreciation of T\u0101hir\u2019s affection, but petitioned him, saying: \u2018Although you are (as) my child, and I neither think of nor desire any son but you, yet I wish you to take me to my nephew, Sult\u0101n Sa\u02bfid Kh\u0101n. For I am grown old, and I have no longer the strength to bear this wandering life in the deserts of Uzbegist\u0101n. Take me where I may enjoy some quiet and repose.\u2019 She then offered to mediate for him and to obtain the support for him of the Mughal Kh\u0101q\u0101ns against his foes. T\u0101hir accordingly escorted her to the Mughalist\u0101n borders, and with her waited upon Sa\u02bfid. \u2018The latter, from love of his aunt, rose, saying that although his rising to receive T\u0101hir was contrary to the rules of Ching\u012bz (their common ancestor), yet that he did it out of gratitude because T\u0101hir had brought his aunt.\u2019\n\nSult\u0101n-nig\u0101r died of a h\u00e6morrhage in the summer of 934H. (1528).\n\nMems., 13, 14, 30, 31, 99, 105.\nT\u0101r. Rash., E. & R., s.n.\nCLXXXIX. Tarkh\u0101n Begam.\n\nThis is a title, and not a personal name.\n\nIn B\u0101bar's time, according to Mr. Erskine (Mems., 24 n.), the ancient title of Tarkh\u0101n had come to belong to a particular family or clan. This may be well seen by consulting Professor Blochmann's \u0100in-i-akbar\u012b, 361, where the genealogical table of the Argh\u016bns of Tatta shows the title to have become hereditary in their branch of the Argh\u016bns.\u00b9\n\nThe Tarkh\u0101n Begam whose name stands above this notice was linked with these Tarkh\u0101n Argh\u016bns in the way shown below. She married her first cousin, Al\u1e25mad M\u012br\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b, and Q\u016bt\u016bq Begam was her foster-sister.\n\nUrda-b\u016bgh\u0101 Tarkh\u0101n Argh\u016bn.\n\n| Daughter = Ab\u016b-sa\u02bf\u012bd M\u012br\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b. | Darvish Mu\u1e25ammad Tarkh\u0101n. | Daughter = \u02bfAbdu-l-\u02bfal\u012b Tarkh\u0101n Argh\u016bn, d. cir. 1490. | Muhammad Maz\u012bd Tarkh\u0101n. |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Mahm\u016bd, b. 1453.                  | Ahmad, = Tarkh\u0101n Begam.  | B\u0101q\u012b Tarkh\u0101n.                                    |                        |\n|                                   | b. 1451; d. 1490.        |                                                  |                        |\n\nMems., 22, 24.\n\u0100in-i-akbar\u012b, Blochmann, 361.\nB. & H., I. and II. s.n.

This exchange may occur in the case of other begas of this appendix. Until a good Turk\u012b text more complete than that in the B. M. is found, this must be left an open question.\n\nIf Zainab be taken as the name of the yanga, she may be identifiable with one of the other women already entered in the appendix, but for deciding this point more examples are necessary of B\u0101bar's application of the word yanga.\n\nMems., 387.\n\nCCII.

A part of her scheme and offer was her own remarriage with Shaib\u0101n\u012b. B\u0101bar stigmatizes her action as \u2018stupidity and folly,\u2019 and says, further, \u2018the wretched and weak woman, for the sake of getting herself a husband, gave the family and honour of her son to the winds. Nor did Shaib\u0101n\u012b Kh\u0101n mind her a bit, or value her even so much as his other handmaids, concubines, or women. Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b M\u012brz\u0101 was confounded at the condition in which he now found himself, and deeply regretted the step he had taken. Several young cavaliers formed a plan for escaping with him, but he would not consent. As the hour of fate was at hand, he could not shun it. They put him to death in the meadow of Kulba. From his overanxiety to preserve this mortal and transitory life, he left a name of infamy behind him; and, from following the suggestions of a woman, struck himself out of the list of those who have earned for themselves a glorious name. It is impossible to write any more of the transactions of such a personage (? Zuhra), and impossible to listen any further to the recital of such base and dastardly proceedings.\u2019\n\nMems.; 29, 30, 31, 83, 84.\nAPPENDIX B.\n\nMahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja.\n\nNiz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn Al\u1e25mad has included in his \u1e6cabaq\u0101t-i-akbar\u012b a story which he heard from his father Mu\u1e25ammad Muq\u012bm Har\u0101wi, and of which the purport is that B\u0101bar\u2019s Khal\u012bfa (Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn \u2018Al\u012b Barl\u0101s) had at one time thought of placing a certain Mahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja on the throne in succession to B\u0101bar.\n\nTwo circumstances cast doubt on the story: (1) It was customary in B\u0101bar\u2019s family for a son to succeed his father; (2) B\u0101bar left four sons, the youngest of whom, Hind\u0101l, was eleven years old.\n\nMoreover, there were Tim\u016brids both of the B\u0101yqr\u0101 and M\u012br\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b branches in India with B\u0101bar whose claims to a Tim\u016brid throne would be strongly enforced.\n\nBut Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn Al\u1e25mad has left us the story in circumstantial detail and it cannot be passed over unnoticed, and this the less because Gul-badan Begam throws some light on the identity of the Mahd\u012b concerned, and also because in an important particular, i.e., the relation of Mahd\u012b to B\u0101bar, I am able, through Mr. Beveridge\u2019s study of the \u1e24ab\u012bbu-s-siy\u0101r, to give more accurate information than was at Mr. Erskine\u2019s disposal.\n\nThe story was old when Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn set it down and it is not necessary to accept all its details as exact. It is sufficient to consider its minimum contents which are, that in the royal household there had been a rumour of a plan of supersession of B\u0101bar\u2019s sons by Mahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja at the instance of Khal\u012bfa.\n\nThe question naturally arises, who was the man\nconcerning whom such intention could be attributed to the wise and experienced Khal\u012bfa?\n\nNiz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn calls Mahd\u012b B\u0101bar\u2019s *dam\u0101d*, and Mr. Erskine, amongst other translators, has rendered this by son-in-law. It is unnecessary to consider why any Mahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja known in history should have been preferred to those sons-in-law who were of B\u0101bar\u2019s own blood, because Gul-badan calls Mahd\u012b B\u0101bar\u2019s *yazna*. For this word the dictionaries yield only the meaning of \u2018brother-in-law\u2019 and \u2018husband of the king\u2019s sister.\u2019 Both these meanings are also attributed to *dam\u0101d*. But the *Hab\u012bb* settles the verbal question by a statement that Mahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja was the husband of Kh\u0101n-z\u0101da Begam, B\u0101bar\u2019s full sister.\n\nIt is not improbable that he had another close link with the Emperor, namely that of relationship to M\u0101ham Begam, but I am not yet able to assert this definitely.\n\nB\u0101bar never mentions Mahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja\u2019s parentage. This is learned from Khw\u0101nd-am\u012br who states that he was the son of M\u016bsa Khw\u0101ja and grandson of Murtaza Khw\u0101ja. He was a sayyid; and from the circumstance that his burial-place was chosen as that of Sayyid Ab\u016bl-ma\u2018\u0101l\u012b Term\u012bz\u012b, it may be inferred that he belonged to the religious house of Termiz. If so, he had probably T\u012bm\u016brid blood in his veins, since inter-marriage between the families was frequent.\n\nB\u0101bar mentions a Khw\u0101ja M\u016bsa who is perhaps Mahd\u012b\u2019s father, in 914H., 1508. He immediately afterwards names Khw\u0101ja Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Al\u012b, M\u0101ham Begam\u2019s brother, in suggestive sequence.\n\nB\u0101bar\u2019s first surviving record of Mahd\u012b is made in 925H. (February, 1519) when \u2018M\u012br Mu\u1e25ammad Mahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja\u2019 brings in a prisoner. It is in *cir.* 923H. (1517) that Khw\u0101nd-am\u012br speaks of the marriage of Mahd\u012b and Kh\u0101n-z\u0101da, but this is probably a good deal after the fact, because Kh\u0101n-z\u0101da was returned to B\u0101bar in 917H. (1511).\nMahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja, as B\u0101bar invariably calls him after his first appearance, went to Hind\u016bst\u0101n with B\u0101bar and is frequently mentioned. It is significant of his high position and presumably not only by marriage but by birth, that on military duty he is always associated with men of royal blood, either T\u012bm\u016brid or Chaghat\u0101\u012b. He is sometimes given precedence of them, and is never named last in a list of officers. Ch\u012bn-t\u012bm\u016br Chaghat\u0101\u012b, Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 B\u0101yqr\u0101, Sult\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 M\u016br\u0101n-sh\u0101h\u012b, and \u2018\u0100dil Sult\u0101n are constantly associated with him. It seems clear that he was a great noble and ranked amongst the highest. Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n calls him Sayyid Khw\u0101ja, and so does Khw\u0101nd-am\u012br. Whether the \u2018Khw\u0101ja\u2019 indicates anything as to his mother\u2019s marriage I am not able to say.\n\nKh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n (I. 42) has a passage which may relate to him: Sult\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 wa Mahd\u012b Sult\u0101n bin\u012b a\u2018m\u0101mr\u0101 (of B\u0101bar) ki as\u012br-i-an juma\u2018 b\u016bdand khal\u0101s sakht. The date of the occurrence is cir. 1511, the year in which another Mahd\u012b, i.e., Uzbeg, was killed by B\u0101bar. Mr. Erskine appears to think that the two men, named here as released, were Hamza and Mahd\u012b Sult\u0101ns Uzbeg; but the sources do not give the style of M\u012brz\u0101 to either of these chiefs. They appear to have had marriage connections with B\u0101bar in an earlier generation, and a son of Mahd\u012b seems to have been \u2018\u0100dil Sult\u0101n (Mems., 368) who was father of \u2018\u0100q\u012bl Sult\u0101n Uzbeg (Akbar-n\u0101ma, I. 221).\n\nA Mahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja who was undoubtedly of B\u0101bar\u2019s family, appears both in the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-rash\u012bd\u012b and in Gul-badan Begam\u2019s Hum\u0101y\u016bn-n\u0101ma. He is the son of Aiman, and grandson of Sult\u0101n A\u1e25mad Kh\u0101n Chaghat\u0101\u012b, B\u0101bar\u2019s mother\u2019s brother. But his age places him out of the question; he was about ten in 1530, and the hero of Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn\u2019s story stroked his beard, and was either a dam\u0101d or a yazna. Mahd\u012b\nChaghat\u0101\u012b, moreover, reached India after B\u0101bar\u2019s death.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe \u1e6cabaq\u0101t states that Mahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja had long been connected with Khalifa; the latter was himself a sayyid.\n\nNiz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn calls Mahd\u012b a j\u016bwan and Mr. Erskine has accentuated all the faults and characteristics of youth in his version of the story. But Gul-badan calls Hind\u0101l an uninjurious youth at thirty-three, and there seems good ground to read often in j\u016bwan the notion of vigour and strength rather than exclusively of fewness of years. In 1530 Mahd\u012b had served B\u0101bar eleven known years.\n\nLike many other such small problems, that of the family connections of Mahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja and the other men of his name may be solved by some chance passage in a less known author, or by a closer consideration of the personages of the Memoirs.\n\nMems., 255, 303, 305-307, 338, 340-342, 344, 345, 349, 352, 363, 370, 371, 401, 426.\\(^2\\)\n\nAkbar-n\u016bma, s.n., \u0100q\u0101 Sult\u0101n and Mahd\u012b.\n\nKh\u0101t\u012b Kh\u0101n, Bib.

Mahd\u012b.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The rough estimate of Mahd\u012b Chaghat\u0101\u012b\u2019s age is made as follows: Aiman was married to Haidar M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s cousin in 923H. (1517). (T\u0101r. Rash., E. and R., 144, 352.) He had five sons by this wife. (l. c. 144 and 401). Of these Mas\u016bd is named as the eldest. The rest are Khizr (Gul-badan\u2019s husband) Mahd\u012b, Is\u0101n-daulat (\u1e24ab\u012bba\u2019s husband), and another. Khizr is inferentially the second son, but if Mahd\u012b were the second, he could hardly have been born before 926H. (1520). This would make him about ten in 1530, but he may have been younger and the third son, as is indicated by the enumeration of Haidar M\u012brz\u0101.\n\n\\(^2\\) At p. 424 Mr. Erskine has an entry of a Sayyid Mahd\u012b who arrives from Gu\u0101l\u012br in July, 1529. That this is a mis-reading for Mashh\u0101d\u012b is shown by collation with other texts than his own.\nINDEX (OTHER THAN OF PLACES).\n\nNote.\u2014This index is full for the pages down to 201.

Mr. Beveridge suggests (1) that it may be a corrupt and domestic form of an Arabic word \u2018al\u0101qaha\u2019 which he finds as what may be termed a corresponding word, in a description of the Peacock Throne and from this we assume the \u201changings\u201d of the translation.

Perhaps this is a t\u00fcr-kh\u0101na. Zenker describes it as a seat of honour of the nature of a throne. It would supply a necessity of Indian life, if one might read taur, net, and allow the royal author a mosquito-room.\n\u0648\u0642\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0622\u06a9\u0627\u0645 \u0628\u06cc\u0634

The \u0634\u06a9\u0631 (Venus) of the text is, he believes, a mistake for \u0633\u064e\u06a9\u064e\u0651\u0631, Sakkiz, eight, the Eight Stars being regarded as unpropitious by Persians. Gul-badan has perhaps confused the portents of a defeat by Shaib\u0101n\u012b at Khw\u0101ja K\u0101rdzin in 1501 and the battle of Kh\u0101nwa in 1527. B\u0101bar's statement about Kh\u0101nwa is that Shar\u012bf gave warning that Mars was in the west and that whoever should come from the east, would be defeated.\n\nB\u0101bar has a characteristic story of his having precipitated the fight at K\u0101rdzin (1501) because the Eight Stars were exactly between the opposing armies and if he had delayed, they would have favoured Shaib\u0101n\u012b for 13 or 14 days. \"These observances were all nonsense and my precipitation was without the least solid excuse.\" He lost the battle.

F.'s parallel passage (Bib. Ind. I. 67), we find a curious resemblance, e.g.\n\n** Pavet de Courteille and Steingass render chap\u0101n by haillons and \"tattered garments\", Erskine (127 and n.) by \"long frocks\". Vamb\u00e9ry gives no chap\u0101n but ch\u0101p\u0101n, which he translates Oberrock and par-dessus. Steingass has no chap\u0101n.\n\n*** The words of the next phrase present difficulty. The sense is \"with clubs in their hands\", and that this is so, is shewn by the parallel passages from the Turki and Persian texts of B\u0101bar's Memoirs.\n\nThe difficult words may be a Turk\u012b interpolation in Gul-badan's text. The word which follows may be read leathern, but includes the notion of leathern and neither the Turki nor the Persian text uses any such qualifying word.
