Nor has it been thought necessary to mark vowels as long in cases where mistakes in pronunciation were not likely to be made.\n\nConsonants\n\nMost Indian languages have different forms for a number of consonants, such as d, t, r, &c., marked in scientific works by the use of dots or italics. As the European ear distinguishes these with difficulty in ordinary pronunciation, it has been considered undesirable to embarrass the reader with them; and only two notes are required. In the first place, the Arabic k, a strong guttural, has been represented by \u1e31 instead of q, which is often used. Secondly, it should be remarked that aspirated consonants are common; and, in particular, dh and th (except in Burma) never have the sound of th in \u2018this\u2019 or \u2018thin,\u2019 but should be pronounced as in \u2018woodhouse\u2019 and \u2018boathook.\u2019\nBurmese Words\n\nBurmese and some of the languages on the frontier of China have the following special sounds:\n\n- aw has the vowel-sound in 'law.'\n- \u014d and \u016b are pronounced as in German.\n- gy is pronounced almost like j in 'jewel.'\n- ky is pronounced almost like ch in 'church.'\n- th is pronounced in some cases as in 'this,' in some cases as in 'thin.'\n- w after a consonant has the force of uv. Thus, ywa and pwe are disyllables, pronounced as if written yuwa and puwe.\n\nIt should also be noted that, whereas in Indian words the accent or stress is distributed almost equally on each syllable, in Burmese there is a tendency to throw special stress on the last syllable.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe names of some places\u2014e.g. Calcutta, Bombay, Lucknow, Cawnpore\u2014have obtained a popular fixity of spelling, while special forms have been officially prescribed for others. Names of persons are often spelt and pronounced differently in different parts of India; but the variations have been made as few as possible by assimilating forms almost alike, especially where a particular spelling has been generally adopted in English books.\n\nNotes on Money, Prices, Weights and Measures\n\nAs the currency of India is based upon the rupee, all statements with regard to money throughout the Gazetteer have necessarily been expressed in rupees, nor has it been found possible to add generally a conversion into sterling. Down to about 1873 the gold value of the rupee (containing 165 grains of pure silver) was approximately equal to 2s., or one-tenth of a \u00a3; and for that period it is easy to convert rupees into sterling by striking off the final cipher (Rs. 1,000 = \u00a3100). But after 1873, owing to the depreciation of silver as compared with gold throughout the world, there came a serious and progressive fall in the exchange, until at one time the gold value of the rupee dropped as low as 1s. In order to provide a remedy for the heavy loss caused to the Government of India in respect of its gold payments to be made in England, and also to relieve foreign trade and finance from the inconvenience due to constant and unforeseen fluctuations in exchange, it was resolved in 1893 to close the mints to the free coinage of silver, and thus force up the value of the rupee by restricting the circulation. The intention was to raise\nthe exchange value of the rupee to 1s. 4d., and then introduce a gold standard (though not necessarily a gold currency) at the rate of Rs. 15 = \u00a31. This policy has been completely successful. From 1899 onwards the value of the rupee has been maintained, with insignificant fluctuations, at the proposed rate of 1s. 4d.; and consequently since that date three rupees have been equivalent to two rupees before 1873. For the intermediate period, between 1873 and 1899, it is manifestly impossible to adopt any fixed sterling value for a constantly changing rupee. But since 1899, if it is desired to convert rupees into sterling, not only must the final cipher be struck off (as before 1873), but also one-third must be subtracted from the result. Thus Rs. 1,000 = \u00a3100 - $\\frac{1}{3}$ = (about) \u00a367.\n\nAnother matter in connexion with the expression of money statements in terms of rupees requires to be explained. The method of numerical notation in India differs from that which prevails throughout Europe. Large numbers are not punctuated in hundreds of thousands and millions, but in lakhs and crores. A lakh is one hundred thousand (written out as 1,00,000), and a crore is one hundred lakhs or ten millions (written out as 1,00,00,000). Consequently, according to the exchange value of the rupee, a lakh of rupees (Rs. 1,00,000) may be read as the equivalent of \u00a310,000 before 1873, and as the equivalent of (about) \u00a36,667 after 1899; while a crore of rupees (Rs. 1,00,00,000) may similarly be read as the equivalent of \u00a31,00,00,000 before 1873, and as the equivalent of (about) \u00a3666,667 after 1899.\n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that the rupee is divided into 16 annas, a fraction commonly used for many purposes by both natives and Europeans. The anna was formerly reckoned as 1$\\frac{1}{2}$d.; it may now be considered as exactly corresponding to 1d. The anna is again subdivided into 12 pies.\n\nThe various systems of weights used in India combine uniformity of scale with immense variations in the weight of units. The scale used generally throughout Northern India, and less commonly in Madras and Bombay, may be thus expressed: one maund = 40 seers; one seer = 16 chittaks or 80 tolas. The actual weight of a seer varies greatly from District to District, and even from village to village; but in the standard system the tola is 180 grains Troy (the exact weight of the rupee), and the seer thus weighs 2.057 lb., and the maund 82.28 lb. This standard is used in official reports and throughout the Gazetteer.\n\nFor calculating retail prices, the universal custom in India is to express them in terms of seers to the rupee. Thus, when prices change, what varies is not the amount of money to be paid for the\nsame quantity, but the quantity to be obtained for the same amount of money. In other words, prices in India are quantity prices, not money prices. When the figure of quantity goes up, this of course means that the price has gone down, which is at first sight perplexing to an English reader. It may, however, be mentioned that quantity prices are not altogether unknown in England, especially at small shops, where pennyworths of many groceries can be bought. Eggs, likewise, are commonly sold at a varying number for the shilling.\n\nIf it be desired to convert quantity prices from Indian into English denominations without having recourse to money prices (which would often be misleading), the following scale may be adopted\u2014based upon the assumptions that a seer is exactly 2 lb., and that the value of the rupee remains constant at 1s. 4d.: 1 seer per rupee = (about) 3 lb. for 2s.; 2 seers per rupee = (about) 6 lb. for 2s.; and so on.\n\nThe name of the unit for square measurement in India generally is the bigha, which varies greatly in different parts of the country. But areas have always been expressed throughout the Gazetteer either in square miles or in acres.\n\nMAP\n\nHyderabad State . . . . . . . . . . . . to face p. 304\nGy\u0101raspur (or Garispur).\u2014Village in the Gwalior State, Central India, situated in $23^\\circ 40' N.$ and $78^\\circ 7' E.$, 24 miles north-east of Bhilsa. Population (1901), 754. Although little is known of the history of the place, the remains of ancient buildings show that its importance, as commanding the pass through which runs the old route from M\u0101lw\u0101 to Bundelkhand, was recognized at an early date. In the sixteenth century it fell to the Gonds of Garh\u0101 Mandl\u0101, but was taken from them by the Mughals. The actual destruction of the temples is attributed, as usual, to Aurangzeb, but may have commenced earlier. At the end of the eighteenth century it fell to the Chandel Th\u0101kurs of Bhilsa, and under Th\u0101kur Kesri Singh regained some of its lost importance. The remains are considerable and cover a large area. The most important are those now known as the Ath-khamb\u0101, or 'eight pillars,' which stand to the south of the present village, and are all that remains of a once magnificent temple. The pillars and also the ceiling slabs, which are still in situ, are richly carved, and a pilgrim's record of A.D. 982 has been cut on one of the pillars. Two other very similar collections of pillars are standing in the village, also covered with elaborate carving, one belonging to a Saivite and the other to a Vaishnavite temple. The finest ruin, however, is that of a large temple known as the M\u0101la Devi. It is magnificently placed on a great artificial platform, on the very edge of the hill-side, with its back against the rock, and from its style must belong to the ninth or tenth century. Though originally a Vaishnavite shrine, it now contains Jain images, all belonging to the Digambara sect. The Bajran\u0101th temple, with three shrines placed abreast, has also been appropriated by Jains, though originally Brahmanical. North of the village lie two tanks, the larger known as the M\u0101nsarowar, having a fine old stone dam, which is said to have been built by M\u0101n Singh, a Gond chief. A school and a State post office are situated in the village.\n\n[A. Cunningham, Archaeological Survey of India, vol. vii, p. 90; vol. xi, p. 31.]\nGyobingauk Township.\u2014Township of Tharrawaddy District, Lower Burma, lying between $18^\\circ 7'$ and $18^\\circ 32'$ N. and $95^\\circ 28'$ and $96^\\circ 1'$ E., with an area of 431 square miles. Like most of the townships of the District, it is traversed north and south by the railway, and abuts in the east on the Pegu Yoma, its western areas being a level plain. The population was 84,327 in 1891, and 91,040 in 1901. It contains two towns, Zizon (population, 2,974) and Gyobingauk; and 411 villages. The area cultivated in 1903\u20134 was 189 square miles, paying Rs. 2,95,000 land revenue.\n\nGyobingauk Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the township of the same name in Tharrawaddy District, Lower Burma, situated in $18^\\circ 14'$ N. and $95^\\circ 40'$ E., on the Rangoon-Prome Railway, 109 miles from Rangoon. Population (1901), 6,930. The town suffers from scarcity of water in the dry season, but so far no systematic water-supply scheme has been started. It is one of the most important rice-trading centres on the Rangoon-Prome line of railway. It possesses one Anglo-veracular and two vernacular private schools, two of which are aided by the municipality. Gyobingauk was constituted a municipality in 1894. The receipts and expenditure of the municipal fund to the end of 1900\u20131 averaged Rs. 24,000 and Rs. 22,000 respectively. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 41,000, including house and land tax (Rs. 3,400), and tolls on markets and slaughter-houses (Rs. 23,200). The expenditure in the same year was Rs. 45,000, the principal items being conservancy (Rs. 6,200), roads (Rs. 6,900), and hospitals (Rs. 3,000). The municipal hospital has eighteen beds.\n\nHab.\u2014River on the western frontier of Sind, Bombay, which forms in the latter part of its course the boundary between British territory and Baluchistan. It rises opposite the Por\u0101li river at the northern end of the Pab range, flows south-east for 25 miles, then due south for 50 miles, and finally south-west, till it falls into the Arabian Sea near Cape Monze, in $24^\\circ 54'$ N. and $66^\\circ 42'$ E., after a total length of about 240 miles. Except the Indus and the G\u0101j, it is the only permanent river in Sind. Its principal tributaries are the S\u0101r\u016bna, the Samotri, and the Wira Hab. As far as the Phusi pass the course is confined and narrow. Thereafter it gradually widens, and for some 50 miles from its mouth is bordered by fine pasture land. Water is always to be found in pools, but the river is not utilized for irrigation.\n\nHabiganj Subdivision.\u2014Subdivision in the south-west corner of Sylhet District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between $23^\\circ 59'$ and $24^\\circ 41'$ N. and $91^\\circ 10'$ and $91^\\circ 43'$ E., with an area of 952 square miles. The subdivision forms a level plain intersected with numerous rivers and watercourses, into the southern portion of which low hills project from the Tippera system. The annual rainfall at Habiganj town averages only 95 inches, which is considerably less than that recorded\nin most other places in the District. The population, which in 1891 was 504,592, had risen by 1901 to 555,001, an increase of 10 per cent., and the density is now 583 persons per square mile, as compared with 416 in the District as a whole. The staple food-crop is *sail*, or transplanted winter rice, and the tea industry has only recently become of importance. In 1904 there were 12 gardens with 9,990 acres under plant, which gave employment to 26 Europeans and 9,505 natives.\n\nThe Assam-Bengal Railway runs through the south of the subdivision, but the rivers, of which the most important are the Bar\u0101k, Khowai, and K\u0101lni, are largely used as trade routes. The subdivision is divided into the four *th\u0101nas* of Habiganj, Baniy\u0101chung, M\u0101dhapur, and Nabiganj, and contains one town, HABIGANJ (population, 5,236), the head-quarters, and 1,935 villages. The subdivisional staff is unusually strong, as the amount of business to be disposed of is large, and four Munsifs are employed on civil work. The Subdivisional Magistrate is generally a native of India. The demand on account of land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 was Rs. 2,11,000.\n\n**Habiganj Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Sylhet District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 24\u00b0 23' N. and 91\u00b0 26' E., at the confluence of the Khowai and Bar\u0101k rivers. The nearest railway station is at Sh\u0101staganj, 9 miles distant. Population (1901), 5,236. Like other towns in this inundated tract, it is built on the bank of the river, which is raised a little above the level of the surrounding country. It is the head-quarters of the Subdivisional Magistrate and his assistants, and of the four Munsifs who dispose of the civil business of the subdivision. The public buildings include a subsidiary jail with accommodation for 54 persons, a dispensary with 6 beds, and a high school with an average attendance of 318 boys. The town was constituted a Union under Bengal Act V of 1876 in 1881. The receipts and expenditure in 1903-4 were about Rs. 5,000. There is a considerable trade with Bengal, most of which goes by country boat. The principal imports are grain and pulse, cotton piece-goods, kerosene and other oils, and salt. The chief exports are rice, jute, mustard, linseed, and hides. The majority of the merchants are members of the Sh\u0101h\u0101 caste.\n\n**Habs\u0101n.**\u2014State in the Kol\u0101ba Political Agency, Bombay. See JANJ\u012aRA.\n\n**Hadagalli.**\u2014Western *t\u0101luk* of Bellary District, Madras, lying between 14\u00b0 46' and 15\u00b0 14' N. and 75\u00b0 40' and 76\u00b0 22' E., south and east of the Tungabhadra, with an area of 585 square miles. The population in 1901 was 92,094, compared with 104,040 in 1891. There are 87 villages, but no town. The head-quarters, after which it is named, is a village of no importance. The demand for land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to Rs. 1,81,000. A tract in the southern corner,\ncomprising nearly one-third of the area, is black cotton soil. Of the remainder, mixed soils occupy about two-thirds and red land one-third. It is one of the flattest taluks in the District, for its many undulations are of the long and low variety, and only in two places in the south can it be said to be broken by hills. The whole drains ultimately into the Tungabhadra, the eastern half by way of the Chikka Hagari. It is perhaps the healthiest part of the District. The abrupt decline which occurred in the number of its inhabitants between 1891 and 1901 was due to the fact that in the former year the Census fell upon a date on which large crowds of pilgrims from Bombay and Mysore were assembled at the great festival at Mailar, and consequently the population as then enumerated was greatly above the normal. Cholam and korra are the staple crops; but cotton is raised on a considerable area in the south, and castor also is extensively grown. The large acreage of horse-gram, a crop which will grow on the poorest land with the lightest rainfall, and the fact that the population per acre of cultivated land is lower than in any other taluk, show, however, that the land is not fertile.\n\nHadgaon.\u2014Northern taluk of Nander District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 476 square miles. It is separated from the B\u0101sim District of Ber\u0101r by the Penganga river. The population in 1901, including j\u0101girs, was 50,422, compared with 86,590 in 1891, the decrease being the result of the famine of 1900. Till recently it had 161 villages, of which 20 were j\u0101gir, and Hadgaon (population, 1,712) is its headquarters. The land revenue in 1901 was 2 lakhs. The soils consist chiefly of regur and alluvium. In 1905 a number of villages were transferred to this taluk from Nander.\n\nHadiy\u0101.\u2014Town in the niz\u0101mat and tahsil of An\u0101hadgarh, Pati\u0101la State, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 19\u2032 N. and 75\u00b0 34\u2032 E., 4 miles south of Barn\u0101la. Population (1901), 5,414, compared with 6,834 in 1881, a decrease due to the rising importance of Barn\u0101la. It has a small trade in grain, and some manufacture of iron and carts. The town has a police post.\n\nHadol.\u2014Petty State in Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\nH\u0101fiz\u0101b\u0101d Tahsil.\u2014Tahsil of Gujr\u0101nw\u0101la District, Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 45\u2032 and 32\u00b0 20\u2032 N. and 73\u00b0 10\u2032 and 73\u00b0 50\u2032 E., on the east bank of the Chen\u0101b, with an area of 894 square miles. In 1893 thirteen estates were transferred from this tahsil to Jhang. Other minor changes in boundaries were made, and lastly, the new tahsil of Kh\u0101ng\u0101h Dogr\u0101n was formed out of the southern part. The population in 1901 was 216,666, compared with 237,397 for the undivided tahsil in 1891. It contains the town of H\u0101fiz\u0101b\u0101d (population, 4,597), the headquarters; and 393 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 3,00,000. The tahsil consists of a riverain belt along the Chen\u0101b, the B\u0101ngar uplands with a light soil and fair facilities for\nwell-irrigation, and the B\u0101r. The whole of the B\u0101r and half the B\u0101ngar are now irrigated.\n\n**H\u0101fiz\u0101b\u0101d Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the *tahsil* of the same name in Gujr\u0101nw\u0101la District, Punjab, situated in $32^\\circ 4'$ N. and $73^\\circ 41'$ E., on the Waz\u012br\u0101b\u0101d-Lyallpur branch of the North-Western Railway. Population (1901), 4,597. It was formerly a place of some importance, and is mentioned in the *Ain-i-Akbari* as head-quarters of a *mah\u0101l*. H\u0101fiz, the founder, was a favourite of the emperor Akbar. The main channel of the Chen\u0101b Canal runs $2\\frac{1}{2}$ miles east of the town, and the newly irrigated land sends its produce to H\u0101fiz\u0101b\u0101d as the nearest mart and railway station. The factory industries of the place are cotton-ginning and flour-milling, and the number of employ\u00e9s in the three mills in 1904 was 73. The District board maintains an Anglo-vernacular middle school and a Government dispensary. The town is administered as a \u2018notified area.\u2019\n\n**H\u0101flang.**\u2014Head-quarters of the North C\u0101ch\u0101r subdivision, in C\u0101ch\u0101r District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $25^\\circ 11'$ N. and $93^\\circ 1'$ E. H\u0101flang stands on the top of a hill, on the north side of the main section of the Barail range. The Subdivisional Magistrate\u2019s court was transferred to this place from Gunjong in 1896, as it then began to acquire considerable importance as the head-quarters of the hill section of the Assam-Bengal Railway. The station is prettily laid out, and commands a fine view of the highest peaks of the Barail and of the surrounding ranges. The railway runs round H\u0101flang hill in a loop nearly 10 miles in length, though the distance through the saddle is less than half a mile. The population in 1901 was 840.\n\n**Hagari** (or *Ved\u0101vati*).\u2014A river of Southern India, formed by two streams, the Veda and Avati, which rise in the B\u0101b\u0101 Budan hills (Mysore), and after feeding the large Ayyankere and Madagkere tanks, thereby irrigating much land, unite to the east of Kad\u016br ($13^\\circ 32'$ N. and $76^\\circ 6'$ E.). The united stream then runs north-east through Chitaldroog District, where it is dammed to form the great M\u0101ri Kanave reservoir, which is 34 square miles in extent, with 70 miles of distributary channels. East of Hiriy\u016br the river, which now takes the name of Hagari, turns north and passes into the Bellary District of Madras, the eastern portion of which it drains. It flows into the Tungabhadra by H\u0101lekota after a course of 280 miles.\n\n**Haidar\u0101b\u0101d Assigned Districts.**\u2014See Ber\u0101r.\n\n**Haidar\u0101b\u0101d.** District, *t\u0101luka*, and city in Sind, Bombay. See Hyder\u0101b\u0101d.\n\n**Haidargarh.**\u2014Southern *tahsil* of B\u0101ra Bank\u012b District, United Provinces, comprising the *parganas* of Haidargarh, Subeha, and Siddhaur, and lying between $26^\\circ 31'$ and $26^\\circ 51'$ N. and $81^\\circ 10'$\nand $81^\\circ 35'$ E., with an area of 291 square miles. The population increased from 194,752 in 1891 to 202,086 in 1901. There are 373 villages, but no town. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 3,37,000, and for cesses Rs. 52,000. The density of population, 694 persons per square mile, is above the District average. Across the middle of the river flows the Gumti between high sandy banks. South of the river the soil is clay. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 189 square miles, of which 75 were irrigated. Tanks or swamps are a less important source of supply than in other parts of the District.\n\n**Haidargarh.** \u2014 Pass in South Kanara District, Madras. See Hosangadi.\n\n**Hailakandi.** \u2014 Subdivision of Cachar District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between $24^\\circ 12'$ and $24^\\circ 53'$ N. and $92^\\circ 26'$ and $92^\\circ 46'$ E., with an area of 414 square miles. It occupies the valley of the Dhaleswari, south of the Barak, and is separated from Sylhet on the west by the Saraspur Hills. The population in 1891 was 99,869, which by 1901 had risen to 112,897, giving a density of 272 persons per square mile, as compared with 121 in the District as a whole. A large part of the subdivision consists of a flat plain producing rice; but the tea industry is also of considerable importance, and in 1904 there were on the higher ground 31 gardens with 11,353 acres under plant, which gave employment to 27 Europeans and 13,600 natives. The annual rainfall averages about 110 inches, which is considerably less than that recorded in the north of the Cachar plains. The subdivision contains 269 villages. The head-quarters of the Magistrate in charge, who is almost invariably a European, are located at Hailakandi. The demand on account of land revenue and local rates in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,33,000.\n\n**Hajiganj.** \u2014 Village in the Chandpur subdivision of Tippera District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $23^\\circ 15'$ N. and $90^\\circ 51'$ E., on the Dakhata river and Assam-Bengal Railway. Population (1901), 297. It is an important centre of river traffic. Betel-nuts and rice are exported in large quantities, while the imports include salt, kerosene oil, and tobacco.\n\n**Hajipur Subdivision.** \u2014 Southern subdivision of Muzaffarpur District, Bengal, lying between $25^\\circ 29'$ and $26^\\circ 1'$ N. and $85^\\circ 4'$ and $85^\\circ 39'$ E., with an area of 798 square miles. The subdivision is an alluvial tract, fertile and highly cultivated, containing a number of swampy depressions in the south-east. The population rose from 714,079 in 1891 to 718,181 in 1901, when there were 900 persons to the square mile. It contains two towns, Hajipur (population, 21,398), its head-quarters, and Lalganj (11,502); and 1,412 villages. The chief trading centres are Hajipur at the confluence of the Gandak with the Ganges, and Lalganj on the Gandak. Basarh is of interest as the\nprobable site of the capital of the ancient kingdom of Vais\u0101l\u012b. H\u0101jipur town figured conspicuously in the history of the struggles between Akbar and the rebellious Afgh\u0101n governors of Bengal.\n\n**H\u0101jipur Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Muzaffarpur District, Bengal, situated in $25^\\circ 41' N.$ and $85^\\circ 12' E.$, on the right bank of the Gandak, a short distance above its confluence with the Ganges opposite Patna. Population (1901), 21,398. It is said to have been founded about 500 years ago by H\u0101ji Ily\u0101s, the supposed ramparts of whose fort enclosing an area of 360 bighas are still visible. The old town is said to have reached as far as Mehn\u0101r th\u0101na, 20 miles to the east, and to a village called Gadaisarai on the north. H\u0101jipur figured conspicuously in the history of the struggles between Akbar and his rebellious Afgh\u0101n governors of Bengal, being twice besieged and captured by the imperial troops, in 1572 and again in 1574. Its command of water traffic in three directions makes the town a place of considerable commercial importance. Moreover, it lies on the main line of the Bengal and North-Western Railway, which runs west from Katih\u0101r, and it is also connected by a direct branch with Muzaffarpur town. H\u0101jipur was constituted a municipality in 1869. The area within municipal limits is 10 square miles. The income during the decade ending 1901\u20132 averaged Rs. 11,000, and the expenditure Rs. 8,900. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 13,000, mainly from a tax on houses and lands; and the expenditure was Rs. 15,000. The town contains the usual public offices; the sub-jail has accommodation for 12 prisoners. Within the area of the old fort is a small stone mosque, very plain but of peculiar architecture, attributed to H\u0101ji Ily\u0101s. Its top consists of three rounded domes, the centre one being the largest. They are built of horizontally placed rows of stones, each row being a circle and each circle being more contracted than the one immediately below it, until the keystone is reached, which is circular. Two other mosques and a small Hindu temple are in the town or its immediate vicinity. A Buddhist temple, surrounded by a sarai or resthouse, was built for the late Sir Jang Bah\u0101dur on the occasion of his visits from Nep\u0101l.\n\n**H\u0101jiw\u0101h.**\u2014Estate in the Mailsi tal\u016bsil of Mult\u0101n District, Punjab, owned by the Kh\u0101kw\u0101ni family of Mult\u0101n, with an area of 94 square miles. Deriving its name from Kh\u0101k\u0101r, a village near Her\u0101t, or from an adventure in hunting the boar (khok), the family first appeared in Mult\u0101n as companions of Hum\u0101y\u016bn. A member of it, Ali Muhammad Kh\u0101n, became s\u016bbahd\u0101r of the province under Ahmad Shah Durr\u0101n\u012b, but was deposed in 1767. Under Muzaffar Kh\u0101n, H\u0101ji Ali Muhammad Kh\u0101n, a cadet of the family, was governor of Sikandar\u0101b\u0101d; and his son Mustafa Kh\u0101n, one of S\u0101wan Mal\u2019s k\u0101rd\u0101rs,\nsupported the British during M\u016blr\u0101j's rebellion, and as tahsild\u0101r of Mailsi rendered good service in the Mutiny. For this he received large grants of land. He also held a lease of the waste lands in the east of the Mailsi tahsil, and to irrigate these constructed the H\u0101jiw\u0101h canal, which, after his death in 1869, was completed by his son Ghul\u0101m K\u0101dir Kh\u0101n. In 1880, 60,000 acres of land irrigated by the canal were conferred on the latter in proprietary right, and this grant was confirmed by deed in 1886. Under a clause in the deed Government took over the canal in 1888; but after litigation on this point, it was held by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1901 that the sons of Ghul\u0101m K\u0101dir Kh\u0101n were entitled to proprietary rights in the canal. Its management, however, is still in the hands of Government. The present holders of the estate, Muhammad Y\u0101r Kh\u0101n, Ahmad Y\u0101r Kh\u0101n, H\u0101fiz Khud\u0101 Bakhsh Kh\u0101n, and H\u0101fiz H\u0101mid Y\u0101r Kh\u0101n, succeeded in 1888.\n\nH\u0101jo.\u2014Village in K\u0101mr\u016bp District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 26\u00b0 15' N. and 91\u00b0 31' E., on the north bank of the Brahmaputra, 15 miles by road from Gauh\u0101ti. Population (1901), 3,803. H\u0101jo is famous for a temple to Siva which stands in a picturesque situation on the top of a low hill. It is said to have been originally built by one Ubo Rishi, and to have been restored by Raghu Deb (A.D. 1583) after it had been damaged by the Muhammadan general K\u0101l\u0101 P\u0101h\u0101r. It is an object of veneration not only to Hindus but also to Buddhists, who visit it in considerable numbers, under the idea that it was at one time the residence of Buddha. The building has some claims to architectural beauty, but was damaged by the earthquake of 1897. A staff of dancing-girls is attached to the temple, and it enjoys a grant of revenue-free land of over 12,000 acres. The tahsil office and police station are situated about a mile from the village, in front of a large and shallow lake which was formed after the earthquake of 1897.\n\nHaka.\u2014Southern subdivision of the Chin Hills, Burma, bounded on the north by the Falam subdivision and on the south by unadministered Chin tracts. The population is composed mostly of Lais (Hakas, Klangklangs, Yokwas, &c.), and in 1901 numbered 33,896, distributed in 153 villages. Haka, with 292 houses, is the most important village in the subdivision.\n\nH\u0101la.\u2014Subdivision of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d District, Sind, Bombay, composed of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, Tando Al\u0101hy\u0101r, Sh\u0101hd\u0101dpur, and H\u0101la talukas.\n\nH\u0101la Taluka.\u2014Taluka of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d District, Sind, Bombay, lying between 25\u00b0 22' and 26\u00b0 6' N. and 68\u00b0 19' and 68\u00b0 43' E., with an area of 503 square miles. The population rose from 91,367 in 1891 to 98,230 in 1901. It contains two towns, H\u0101la (population, 4,985), the head-quarters, and Mati\u0101ri (6,608); and 103 villages. The density,\n195 persons per square mile, exceeds the District average. Land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to 1.7 lakhs. The taluka, which lies parallel to the Indus, is at a very high level and is irregular in shape, narrowing in the middle to barely 7 miles in breadth. The principal crops are bajra, tobacco, and cotton.\n\nHala Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d District, Sind, Bombay, formerly known as Murtaz\u0101b\u0101d, situated in 25\u00b0 49' N. and 68\u00b0 28' E. Population (1901), 4,985. The local trade consists chiefly of grain, piece-goods, gh\u012b, cotton, and sugar. H\u0101la has long been famous for its glazed pottery and tiles, made from a fine clay obtained from the Indus, mixed with powdered flints. The ornamentation is brilliant and tasteful. S\u016bs\u012bs or striped trouser-cloths, for which H\u0101la is also celebrated, are manufactured. The new town was built about 1800, in consequence of the old site, 2 miles distant, which is said to have been founded in 1422, being threatened with encroachment by the Indus. Khud\u0101b\u0101d, 2 miles from New H\u0101la, was once a favourite residence of the T\u0101lpur chiefs, and is said to have rivalled Hyder\u0101b\u0101d in size and population. Among the antiquities round which the new town has grown up are the tomb and mosque of a P\u012br or Muhammadian saint, who died in the sixteenth century, and in whose honour a fair, largely attended by Muhammadans from all parts of the province, is held twice a year. The British Government contributed Rs. 1,000 to the repair of this tomb in 1876. H\u0101la is situated on the Aliganj canal, and is immediately connected with the trunk road at two points. The municipality dates from 1859, and had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 6,132. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 7,250. The town contains a dispensary, a Subordinate Judge's court, and a boys' school.\n\nHalar (Hallawar).\u2014Prant or division of K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay. It takes its name from the J\u0101reja H\u0101lla R\u0101jputs, and includes, among others, the chiefships of Nav\u0101nagar, Morvi, Gondal, W\u0101nk\u0101ner, Dhrol, and R\u0101jkot. The limits of the tract, which measures 7,477 square miles, are not strictly defined. It lies in the north-west of the peninsula, and embraces the level tract between the Gulf of Cutch, the taluka of Okh\u0101mandal (Baroda territory), the Bard\u0101 hills, and the Arabian Sea. Locally this area is known as Bar\u0101ri. The total population in 1901 was 764,992. The total revenue in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 60,84,835.\n\nHalaria.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nHaldaur.\u2014Town in the District and taluka of Bijnor, United Provinces, situated in 29\u00b0 17' N. and 78\u00b0 16' E., 12 miles south-east of Bijnor town. Population (1901), 5,628. The place is said to have been founded by one Halda Singh, the reputed ancestor of the Chauhans to whom it now belongs. The head of the family suffered for his loyalty\nin 1857, and was rewarded with the title of R\u0101j\u0101. Haldaur contains a post office and a handsome house, the residence of the Chauh\u0101n proprietor. A panchayat of sugar-refiners is held annually, which settles the price to be paid to cultivators for raw sugar, and the rate so fixed is accepted as a standard over the whole District. The primary school has 40 pupils, and two aided schools have 94 pupils.\n\nHaldi.\u2014Town in the Rasr\u0101 tahsil of Balli\u0101 District, United Provinces, situated in 26\u00b0 6' N. and 83\u00b0 56' E., on the right bank of the Gogra. Population (1901), 5,269. Haldi is the head-quarters of the tract originally owned by the Chaubari\u0101 R\u0101jputs. It has a considerable trade in timber, imported from the Gorakhpur forests. The school has 56 pupils.\n\nHaldib\u0101ri.\u2014Town in the Cooch Beh\u0101r State, Bengal, situated in 26\u00b0 21' N. and 88\u00b0 49' E., on the Eastern Bengal State Railway, 292 miles from Calcutta. Population (1901), 1,112. Haldib\u0101ri is an important centre of the jute trade, and several European firms have branches established here.\n\nHaldipur.\u2014Village in the Hon\u0101var taluka of North Kanara District, Bombay, situated in 14\u00b0 20' N. and 74\u00b0 28' E., 5 miles north of Hon\u0101var town. Population (1901), 5,109. It is defended on the sea side by Basavr\u0101jdurg, better known as the Fortified Island, about half a mile from the coast. Haldipur has a large number of Hindu temples, at three of which car processions take place annually. A fair attended by 5,000 to 6,000 people is held in March. Under the kings of Bednur (1570\u20131763) and Mysore (1763\u20131800) it was the head-quarters of the Hon\u0101var taluka. In 1801 Buchanan found it an open town, with 352 houses, to the east of a considerable creek running through the plain. Its old name of Handipur or \u2018hog town\u2019 was changed by Haidar Al\u012b to Haldipur or \u2018turmeric town.\u2019\n\nHaldw\u0101ni.\u2014Head-quarters of the Bh\u0101bar tract of Nain\u012b T\u0101l District, United Provinces, situated in 29\u00b0 13' N. and 79\u00b0 32' E., on the road from Barcilly to Nain\u012b T\u0101l and on the Rohilkhand and Kumaun Railway. Population (1901), 6,624. The name is derived from the haldu trees (Adina cordifolia) which abound in the neighbourhood. Haldw\u0101ni was founded in 1834 as a mart for the hill people who visit the Bh\u0101bar in the cold season. It has now become the winter head-quarters of the officers of the Kumaun Division and of Nain\u012b T\u0101l District. Besides the offices, it contains a small jail and a dispensary, and is the head-quarters of a tahsild\u0101r. Between 1897 and 1904 Haldw\u0101ni was administered as a municipality, the income and expenditure during the four years ending 1901 averaging Rs. 9,700 and Rs. 9,100 respectively. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 14,000, the chief item being rents and fees (Rs. 5,500); and the expenditure was Rs. 13,000. In 1904 Haldw\u0101ni was constituted a \u2018notified area.\u2019 It is the principal\nmart in the Bh\u0101bar, exporting oilseeds, forest produce, and the products of the hills. There are two schools with 77 pupils.\n\n**Halebid.**\u2014Village in the north-east of the Bel\u016br taluk of Hassan District, Mysore, situated in $13^\\circ 13'$ N. and $76^\\circ 0'$ E., 18 miles southwest of B\u0101n\u0101var railway station. Population (1901), 1,524. *Hal\u012b-bidu*, 'old capital,' marks the site of Dorasamudra or Dv\u0101r\u0101vat\u012bpura, the capital of the Hoysala kings, founded early in the eleventh century. The city was taken by the Muhammadian general Malik K\u0101sf\u016br in 1310, and plundered of immense wealth. In 1326 another Musalm\u0101n army carried off what remained, and totally destroyed the city. Its splendour is attested not only by the fabulous riches obtained from its conquest, as stated by Muhammadian historians, but by its architectural monuments, which still rank among the masterpieces of Hindu art. The most remarkable are the Hoysalesvara and K\u0113daresvara temples, the latter unfortunately in ruins. The Hoysalesvara, though never completed, was praised in the highest terms by Fergusson, as a foremost example of Hindu architecture. There are also some striking Jain *bastis*, but these are not decorated with the lavish sculpture of the other temples. Traces of different parts of the old city are still pointed out.\n\n**H\u0101lisahar.**\u2014Town in the Barrackpore subdivision of the District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal, situated in $22^\\circ 56'$ N. and $88^\\circ 29'$ E., on the east bank of the Hooghly. Population (1901), 10,149. It was formerly called Kum\u0101rh\u0101ta, and is a noted home of *pandits*; among other devotees of Gaur\u0101nga, R\u0101m Pras\u0101d Sen lived here. It was constituted a municipality in 1903. The income for six months of 1903\u20134 was Rs. 4,200, of which Rs. 1,600 was derived from a tax on persons (or property tax), Rs. 1,400 from a conservancy rate, and Rs. 900 from a tax on houses and lands. During the same period the expenditure amounted to Rs. 2,300. At K\u0101nchr\u0101p\u0101ra within this municipality are the workshops of the Eastern Bengal State Railway.\n\n**Haliy\u0101l Taluka** (or Supa).\u2014Northern taluka of North Kanara District, Bombay, lying between $14^\\circ 54'$ and $15^\\circ 32'$ N. and $74^\\circ 15'$ and $74^\\circ 55'$ E., with an area of 1,057 square miles, including the Supa petty subdivision (*petha*). It contains two towns, of which Haliy\u0101l (population, 4,992), the head-quarters, is the larger; and 237 villages. The population in 1901 was 56,130, compared with 63,348 in 1891. Haliy\u0101l is one of the most thinly populated talukas in the District, with a density of only 53 persons per square mile. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was 1.05 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 7,000. The taluka consists of a waving upland, seamed by the river K\u0101lin\u0101di and its tributaries. The north and east form an open plain. The staple crops are rice and sugar-cane. Forests of teak, black-wood, and\nbamboo cover a large part. Haliy\u0101l has a smaller rainfall than any other taluka in the District, the annual average being only 47 inches.\n\n**Haliy\u0101l Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in North Kanara District, Bombay, situated in $15^\\circ 26' N.$ and $74^\\circ 46' E.$, 9 miles from the Aln\u0101var station on the Southern Mahratta Railway. Population (1901), 4,992, including suburbs. Colonel Wellesley, afterwards the Duke of Wellington, visited Haliy\u0101l, and speaks highly in his Dispatches of its importance as a frontier post. The Haliy\u0101l timber d\u00e9p\u00f4t supplied the best bamboo, teak, and black-wood of the North Kanara jungles before the opening of the new d\u00e9p\u00f4t at T\u0101var-gatti. The municipality, which dates from 1865, had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 8,400. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 8,700. The town contains a dispensary and four schools.\n\n**H\u0101l\u014dl.**\u2014Head-quarters of the petty subdivision (*petha*) of the same name in the K\u0101l\u014dl taluka of the Panch Mah\u0101ls District, Bombay, situated in $22^\\circ 30' N.$ and $73^\\circ 29' E.$, on the high road to J\u0101mbughoda, about 7 miles south of K\u0101l\u014dl and 4 north-west of P\u0101v\u0101garh hill. Population (1901), 2,819. Besides well-to-do Kunb\u012b cultivators, the largest class in the village, there are V\u0101nia traders carrying on business in grain and forest produce with J\u0101mbughoda, and in hardware, tobacco, and cloth with Godhra and Baroda. At H\u0101l\u014dl is said to have been (1484) the most beautiful of all the gardens for which Ch\u0101mp\u0101ner was famous. The chief relic of its former prosperity as a suburb of Ch\u0101mp\u0101ner is a reservoir of considerable size to the north-east. Near the present site is a mausoleum, which was described in 1785 as consisting of two large and five small domed structures, all of admirable workmanship, the two larger containing marble tombs adorned with excellent skill. Since then some of the domes have fallen, but in other respects the buildings are in good repair. They were raised by Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h (1526\u201337) in honour of his brother Sikandar Sh\u0101h, who was murdered by Im\u0101d-ul-mulk in 1526 (May 30) after a reign of three months and seventeen days. The mausoleum contains two other tombs\u2014one to Nasir Kh\u0101n, the other to Lat\u012bf Kh\u0101n, both of them brothers of Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h, who died in the same year (1526). The town contains a dispensary, and two schools for boys and one for girls, attended by 181 and 51 pupils respectively.\n\n**Halsi** (or Halasige).\u2014Village in the Kh\u0101n\u0101pur taluka of Belgaum District, Bombay, situated in $15^\\circ 32' N.$ and $74^\\circ 36' E.$, about 10 miles south-east of Kh\u0101n\u0101pur. Population (1901), 2,192. Halsi stands on an ancient site, which was the chief capital of the early Kadambas (A.D. 500) and a minor capital of the Goa Kadambas (980\u20131250). Two large temples (Var\u0101hnarsingh\u2019s and Suvarneshwar\u2019s) stand in the village, and a third (R\u0101meshwar\u2019s) on a hill about 2 miles to the west.\nThere is an inscription, dated A.D. 1169, on the temple of Var\u0101hnarsingh. About 1860, six copperplates were found in a mound close to a small well called Chakratirth, on the Nandgad road, about 3 miles north of Halsi, recording grants by an old dynasty of Kadamba kings, whose capitals were at Banv\u0101si and Halsi, and who were Jains by faith. They may be assigned to about the fifth century A.D. Halsi is also called Palashika, Palshi, and Halasige in inscriptions. The village contains a boys' school with 66 pupils.\n\nHalvad.\u2014Fortified town in the State of Dhr\u0101ngadhra, K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay, situated in 23\u00b0 1' N. and 71\u00b0 14' E., 85 miles south-west of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d. Population (1901), 5,312. Halvad was once the capital of the State, and is said to resemble a plough in shape, its name being popularly derived from this peculiarity. It possesses a fine palace built on the S\u0101matsar lake, and a number of s\u0101t\u012b memorial stones with several old temples.\n\nHamirpur District.\u2014District in the Allah\u0101b\u0101d Division of the United Provinces, lying between 25\u00b0 5' and 26\u00b0 7' N. and 79\u00b0 17' and 80\u00b0 21' E., with an area of 2,289 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the Jumna, which separates it from Cawnpore and Fatehpur, and by the Betw\u0101, which divides it from J\u0101laun and the Native State of Baoni; on the west the Dhas\u0101n separates it from Jh\u0101nsi; on the south lie the States of Alipur\u0101, Chhatarpur, and Charkh\u0101ri; and on the east the District marches with B\u0101nd\u0101. The Native States of Sar\u012bla, Jigni, and Behat, and portions of Charkh\u0101ri and Garrauli form enclaves, entirely surrounded by British territory. Hamirpur lies chiefly in the great plain of Bundelkhand, which stretches between the banks of the Jumna and the outer scarps of the Vindhyan plateau. The hilly southern region is broken by scattered outlying spurs and isolated hills, some distance from the main Vindhyan range, which does not enter the District.\n\nPhysical aspects.\n\nTheir general elevation does not exceed 300 feet above the Jumna valley, or about 800 feet above the sea. Though the hills are usually treeless, the scenery is picturesque, owing to their rugged outlines, and some of the artificial lakes are exceptionally beautiful. These magnificent reservoirs were constructed by the Gaharw\u0101r and Chandel R\u0101j\u0101s, before the Muhammadan conquest, as sheets of ornamental water, and consist of valleys or depressions hemmed in by rocky hills and massive artificial dams. Some of them enclose craggy islets or peninsulas crowned by the ruins of granite temples. The largest lake near Mahob\u0101 has a circumference of more than 4 miles; and several lakes are used for irrigation. North of the hill and lake country the plain spreads in an arid and almost treeless level towards the banks of the rivers. Of these, the principal are the Betw\u0101, and its tributary the Dhas\u0101n, neither of which is navigable. The chief drainage channel\nin the centre of the District is the Birm\u0101 Nadi, a tributary of the Betw\u0101.\n\nMost of the District consists of Gangetic alluvium, which conceals the underlying rocks, except in the southern hills, where the Bundelkhand gneiss is exposed.\n\nThe District is remarkable for the absence of trees. At the commencement of the eighteenth century one-third of it was densely wooded; but the jungle has been largely cleared. In the lower hills and valleys khair (Acacia Catechu), sej (Lagerstroemia parviflora), dhaw\u0101 (Anogeissus latifolia), and tend\u016b (Diospyros tomentosa) are the most valuable trees, but are of poor quality. In the plains the tamarind, nim (Melia Azadirachta), and mahu\u0101 (Bassia latifolia) are commonly found. The mango is rare.\n\nLeopards, hyenas, wolves, jackals, antelope, and hog are fairly common, while a few sambar and chital are also found. The usual game-birds occur, and fish, including mahseer, are common in the rivers and lakes.\n\nThe climate of Ham\u012brpur is dry and hot, owing to the absence of shade and the bareness of the soil.\n\nThe annual rainfall averages about 36 inches, varying from 33 in the north to 39 in the south. In 1868\u20139 only 17 inches were received, and in 1894\u20135 more than 56 inches.\n\nThe earliest traditions connected with the District relate that it was ruled by Gaharw\u0101r R\u0101jputs, to whom the construction of some of the embankments forming the lakes is attributed. They were followed by the Parih\u0101rs, to whom succeeded the Chandels about the middle of the ninth century. During the Chandel supremacy in Bundelkhand, Mahob\u0101 in the south of Ham\u012brpur District was one of the chief capitals of that dynasty. The Chandels adorned the town and its neighbourhood with many splendid edifices, remains of which still exist; they also constructed some of the noble artificial lakes already described. In 1182 Parm\u0101l Deva was defeated by Prithwi R\u0101j, the Chauh\u0101n ruler of Delhi; after which disaster the Chandel princes abandoned Mahob\u0101 and sank in importance, though they still occupied the hill fort of Kalinjar in B\u0101nd\u0101 District. About twenty years later Mahob\u0101 was conquered by Kutb-ud-d\u012bn, and with occasional interruptions remained in the hands of the Musalm\u0101ns till the close of the seventeenth century.\n\nIn 1680 the District came into the possession of Chhatars\u0101l, the great national hero of the Bundel\u0101s, and was the theatre of many battles during his long struggle with the imperial forces under Muhammad Kh\u0101n, the Bangash Naw\u0101b of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d and governor of Allah\u0101b\u0101d. On his death about 1734 he bequeathed to his ally, the Peshw\u0101 of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, one-third of his territories; and Mahob\u0101 formed a portion\nof the region so granted. The larger part of the present District of Hamirpur fell to his son, Jagat R\u0101j. During the next seventy years the District continued under the government of his descendants, who, however, carried on among themselves that intestine warfare which was universal in Bundelkhand throughout the latter half of the eighteenth century. Rival R\u0101j\u0101s had forts in every village, and one after the other collected their revenue from the same estates. Moreover, the Bundel\u0101 princes were opposed by the Mar\u0101th\u0101 chieftains; and Ali Bah\u0101dur, an illegitimate descendant of the Peshw\u0101, who had made himself Naw\u0101b of B\u0101nd\u0101, succeeded in 1790 in annexing a portion of the District. He was defeated by the British and died in 1802. The British District of Bundelkhand was formed in the succeeding year (1803), a part being granted to our ally, Himmat Bah\u0101dur, as the price of his allegiance. The town of Mahob\u0101 itself, with the surrounding country, remained in the hands of the Pandits of J\u0101laun, until, on the death of their last representative in 1840, it lapsed to the British. The pargana known as Jaitpur was ruled by the descendants of Chhatars\u0101l until 1842, when the last R\u0101j\u0101, believing that our reverses at K\u0101bul would prove fatal to British rule, revolted, and having been easily captured was removed to Cawnpore, receiving a pension of Rs. 2,000 a month. Jaitpur was handed over to another claimant, who mortgaged it to the Government, and died without issue in 1849. His territories lapsed, and have since formed part of Hamirpur. The later history of the District up to 1857 is chiefly concerned with the difficulties of fiscal administration, which will be described later.\n\nOn the outbreak of the Mutiny, Hamirpur exhibited the same return to anarchy which characterized the whole of Bundelkhand. On June 13, 1857, the 53rd Native Infantry broke into mutiny, and the massacre of Europeans began the next day. Only one Christian escaped with life. The surrounding native chiefs set up rival claims to portions of the British territory and plundered all the principal towns. The Charkh\u0101n R\u0101j\u0101 alone maintained a wavering allegiance, which grew firmer as the forces of General Whitlock approached Mahob\u0101. That town was reached in September, 1858, and the fort of Srinagar was destroyed. After a short period of desultory guerrilla warfare in the hilly regions of Bundelkhand, the rebels were effectually quelled and the work of reorganization began.\n\nThe most important remains of the Chandels in this District are at Mahob\u0101, but the finest temple of large size is the three-steepled granite edifice at Makarbai, 8 miles away.\n\nHamirpur contains 7 towns and 756 villages. Population is liable to considerable variations, owing to vicissitudes of season. The numbers at the last four enumerations were: (1872) 529,137, (1881) 507,337, (1891) 513,720, and (1901)\nThere are five tahsils\u2014Ham\u012brpur, Rath, Kulpah\u0101r, Mahob\u0101, and Maudah\u0101\u2014each named after its head-quarters. The principal towns are Rath, Mahob\u0101, and Ham\u012brpur, the District head-quarters. The following table gives the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil     | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Numbers able to read and write |\n|------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Ham\u012brpur   | 376                  | 2               | 124      | 71,625     | 190                       | -11.7                                                    | 2,800                           |\n| Rath       | 574                  | 1               | 179      | 125,731    | 219                       | -0.9                                                     | 3,990                           |\n| Kulpah\u0101r   | 558                  | 2               | 231      | 111,926    | 201                       | -12.3                                                    | 3,003                           |\n| Mahob\u0101     | 329                  | 1               | 92       | 61,938     | 188                       | -16.5                                                    | 2,081                           |\n| Maudah\u0101    | 452                  | 1               | 130      | 87,322     | 193                       | -15.9                                                    | 3,333                           |\n| **District total** | **2,289**          | **7**           | **756**  | **458,542**| **200**                   | **-10.9**                                                | **15,207**                      |\n\nThe considerable decrease between 1891 and 1901 was due to a series of bad seasons, culminating in the famine of 1895\u20137. The density of population is approximately the same as that of the surrounding Bundelkhand Districts, but is less than half the Provincial average. Almost the whole population speak Western Hindi, the prevailing dialect being Bundeli, which is, however, mixed with Bagheli.\n\nCham\u0101rs (tanners and cultivators), 64,000, are the most numerous Hindu caste; followed by Lodhis or Lodhas (agriculturists), 53,000; Br\u0101hmans, 49,000; Ahirs, 31,000; R\u0101jputs, 27,000; and K\u0101chhis, 24,000. Basors, numbering 11,000, who perform low menial duties, and Khang\u0101rs, 7,000, who are watchmen and thieves, though they claim to have once held the country, are not found outside the District in considerable numbers. Agriculture supports 64 per cent. of the population, and general labour 6 per cent. Br\u0101hmans, R\u0101jputs, and Lodhas are the chief holders of land; and the same castes, followed by K\u0101chhis and Cham\u0101rs, are the principal cultivators.\n\nA mission was opened at Mahob\u0101 by an American society in 1895, and there are branches at Rath and Maudah\u0101; but in 1901 there were only 223 native Christians in the District.\n\nThe most important distinction between different parts of the District follows the distribution of different classes of soil. These fall into two main classes: the black or heavy soils, and the light soils. The former are called m\u0101r and k\u0101bar, and the latter pariv\u0101; but near the rivers, where denudation has impoverished the soils, a coarse gravelly soil is found, called r\u0101kar. In the north of the District the black soils predominate, while in the south there is a great deal of poor light soil overlying the rocks. M\u0101r is the most fertile soil, and retains moisture for a long time, though an excess of\nrain makes it unworkable. *K\u0101bar* differs from *m\u0101r* in that it is more easily affected by either excess or deficiency of rainfall. The autumn crops, which are usually sown broadcast, cover a larger area than the spring harvest.\n\nThe ordinary tenures of the United Provinces are found, but *pattid\u0101ri* and *bhaiy\u0101ch\u0101r\u0101 mah\u0101ls* predominate: some of the latter are extraordinarily large. The main agricultural statistics for 1903\u20134 are given below, in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil   | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|----------|-------|------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Hamirpur | 376   | 183        | 2         | 113             |\n| R\u0101th     | 574   | 329        | 2         | 95              |\n| Kulph\u0101r  | 558   | 257        | 17        | 175             |\n| Mahob\u0101   | 329   | 133        | 5         | 133             |\n| Maudah\u0101  | 452   | 230        | 2         | 140             |\n| **Total**| **2,289** | **1,132** | **28**    | **656**         |\n\n**Note.\u2014** Statistics for the Hamirpur and Maudah\u0101 tahsils are for 1902\u20133.\n\nGram and *jow\u0101r* are the principal food-crops, covering 279 and 265 square miles respectively, or 25 and 23 per cent. of the net cultivated area. Oilseeds (240 square miles) and cotton (84) are the most important non-food crops; while *arhar*, *kodon*, wheat, *bajra*, and barley cover 94, 43, 76, 43, and 34 square miles. A little sugar-cane is grown in the south and west, and *p\u0101n* is cultivated in the south.\n\nLike all the Bundelkhand Districts, Hamirpur is subject to cycles of varying agricultural prosperity, and no permanent advance can be traced. Either excess or deficiency of rainfall causes land to remain untilled; and the result is the spread of a grass called *k\u0101ns* (*Saccharum spontaneum*), which cannot be eradicated without much trouble, though it dies out after a varying period of ten to fifteen years. The spring crops are also liable to rust. The most striking change in recent years was the replacement of wheat by gram or millet, both inferior crops, after the famine of 1895\u20137; but the area under wheat is again increasing.\n\nA valuable red dye was formerly obtained from a plant called *\u0101l* (*Morinda citrifolia*); but its cultivation has ceased owing to the introduction of aniline colours. Considerable sums have been advanced under the Land Improvement and Agriculturists' Loans Acts, amounting to a total of Rs. 2,64,000 during the ten years ending 1900, of which 2 lakhs was advanced in the three bad years 1896\u20138. Between 1901 and 1904 the total advances were Rs. 82,000.\n\nIn 1867 six bulls were imported from H\u0101nsi and Hiss\u0101r, but the cross had little effect in improving the District breed, which is on the whole inferior. Renewed attempts have recently been made to\nintroduce a better strain. No horse-breeding operations are carried on. The sheep and goats are superior to those bred in the Do\u0101b, and are thus in some request outside the District.\n\nThe water-supply is defective in almost every part, and difficulties sometimes occur in supplying water for cattle. It has already been stated that the black soils retain moisture, and with ordinary seasons irrigation is not much required in them. In 1903-4 the total irrigated area was 28 square miles, of which 4 square miles were supplied by a branch of the Betw\u0101 Canal in the north of the District, and 1 square mile by the artificial lakes in the south. Wells supplied 22 square miles, being most used in the light parw\u0101 soil in the central and southern parts. A project for a canal from the Dhas\u0101n near the south-west corner of the District has been sanctioned; it will water the western portion between the Birn\u0101 and the Dhas\u0101n.\n\nSoapstone is quarried at one place, and used for making toys, parts of hukkas, vases, &c. The roads in the south are metalled with broken granite, and elsewhere with kankar or nodular limestone, which is also used for making lime.\n\nHamirpur District is almost entirely agricultural, and beyond the few requirements of the people which can be satisfied locally, there are few industries. Coarse red cotton cloth is the only important manufacture, and the silver ware of Maudah\u0101 is the sole product of artistic merit. A little saltpetre is made in places. There are small cotton-presses at Kulpah\u0101r and Mahob\u0101, and at the former place hay is pressed into bales for export.\n\nThe noticeable feature in the trade of the District is the absence of large central markets. Jow\u0101r, bajra, wheat, gram, cotton, ghi, p\u0101n, oilseeds, and cloth are exported in favourable seasons; while sugar, tobacco, spices, rice, salt, piece-goods, and metals are imported. The trade of the north of the District is by road with Cawnpore, while the railway carries the produce of the southern part. R\u0101th is the most important trade centre, and the other markets are essentially local, merchants or their agents dealing on the spot with the cultivators and small village traders.\n\nThe Midland branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway from Jh\u0101nsi to M\u0101nikpur passes through the south of the District. The roads have recently been improved, but communications are still backward, and during the rains many of the unmetalled roads become almost impassable. About 100 miles are metalled, of which 55 are maintained at the cost of Provincial revenues, and 419 miles are unmetalled. Avenues of trees are kept up on 122 miles of road. The principal routes are the roads from Cawnpore through Hamirpur town, Maudah\u0101, and Mahob\u0101 to Saugor; from Hamirpur, through R\u0101th, to Harp\u0101lpur.\nand Kulpah\u0101r railway stations; and from Ham\u012brpur through the east of the District to Panw\u0101r\u012b on the railway.\n\nThe District appears to have escaped the terrible famines of 1783 and 1803-4. In 1813-4, however, it suffered severely, and again in 1819 the food supply failed, though the people had money, gained by the high prices of cotton in previous years. A succession of bad seasons culminating in the drought of 1833-4 led to famine, pestilence, and emigration, which reduced the population by a half, and were long remembered. Distress was less severe in 1837-8, but was still great. The District escaped famine in its worst form till 1868-9, when the failure of the rains caused the loss of the harvest, and people were reduced to eating the refuse of oilseeds, and roots and herbs. There was also great mortality among the cattle. The drought of 1877-8 did not seriously affect Ham\u012brpur. Early in 1894 rust damaged the spring crops, and the rains of that year destroyed the autumn harvest. In 1895 rust was again bad, and the rains ceased prematurely, causing much distress. Relief works were required early in 1896, and the still shorter rainfall of that year caused severe famine. The works were kept open till August, 1897, at a total cost of nearly 9 lakhs, besides expenditure on relief by other methods.\n\nThe Mahob\u0101 and Kulpah\u0101r tahsils are included in the subdivision of Mahob\u0101, which is usually in charge of a resident Joint-Magistrate. The Collector is also assisted by two Deputy-Collectors recruited in India, and a tahsild\u0101r is stationed at the head-quarters of each tahsil.\n\nThere is one District Munsif, and the whole District is included in the Civil and Sessions Judgeship of B\u0101nd\u0101. In former times Ham\u012brpur was noted for dacoity and robberies; but crime is not exceptionally serious now. The escape of criminals is, however, facilitated by the way in which Native and British territory are intermingled. Female infanticide was formerly suspected, but no villages have been under surveillance since 1900.\n\nMost of the present District was acquired in 1803-4, when it was included in the District of Bundelkhand. In 1819 this was divided into a northern and southern portion, the former, called K\u0101lp\u012b, including parts of the present J\u0101laun District and the northern parts of Ham\u012brpur. In 1821 the head-quarters were moved to Ham\u012brpur town. The Mar\u0101th\u0101 method of administration was briefly a system of rack-rent pitched at the highest rate which could be paid. The earliest settlements, though based on the tahsild\u0101rs' unreliable estimates and the village papers, were moderate and well distributed. From 1810, however, enhancements were made, and in 1816 the revenue of that portion of the District which was then British territory was raised\nfrom 9\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) to 14.7 lakhs. In the succeeding short-term settlements the revenue, though reduced, was still excessive; and after the famine of 1833-4 half the estates in the District had been resigned by their proprietors. Speculations in land and corruption among the native officials added to the difficulties of administration. The first regular settlement, preceded by a professional survey, was made in 1842 for most of the District; the southern portions, which were acquired subsequently, being regularly settled at later dates. The assessment was based on rates which had been fixed for a large part of Bundelkhand; it was moderate and worked well. The demand for the area referred to above was 9.8 lakhs, and the demand for the whole District 10.8 lakhs. This demand was revised in 1877-9, when the revenue fixed amounted to 10.7 lakhs. Soil rates were framed to calculate the 'assets,' and the valuation was revised with reference to the recorded rental, fiscal history, and actual condition of each village. The term of settlement was twenty years, and in 1893 it was decided to prolong this period for ten years more. The famine of 1895-7, however, led to extensive reductions, and an experiment was made in fluctuating assessments. In 1905 the whole District came under settlement according to the new system devised for Bundelkhand, by which the revenue will be liable to revision every five years in case of considerable variations in cultivation. The present demand for land revenue is 8.2 lakhs, or an incidence of less than 11 annas per acre, varying in different parts from 8 annas to R. 1.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and total revenue have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 10,68  | 10,77  | 9,76   | 7,74   |\n| Total revenue  | 11,65  | 13,83  | 12,50  | 9,94   |\n\nNo municipalities have been constituted, but seven towns are administered under Act XX of 1856. Local affairs beyond the limits of these are managed by the District board, which in 1903-4 had an income and expenditure of 1.2 lakhs. The expenditure includes Rs. 75,000 on roads and buildings.\n\nThere are 21 police stations. The District Superintendent of police controls a force of 3 inspectors, 79 subordinate officers, and 334 constables, besides 86 town police, and 1,161 rural and road police. The District jail contained a daily average of 79 prisoners in 1903.\n\nHam\u012brpur compares favourably with other Districts in the United Provinces as regards literacy. This is the more remarkable in a purely agricultural community. In 1901, 3.3 per cent. (6.5 males and 0.1\nfemales) could read and write. The total number of public schools rose from 91 in 1880-1 to 98 in 1900-1, and the number of pupils from 3,551 to 3,720. There were 131 such schools in 1903-4, with 4,993 pupils, including 64 girls, besides 52 private schools with 708 pupils. Only 955 out of the total number were in secondary classes. Two of the schools are managed by Government and 97 by the District board. Out of a total expenditure on education of Rs. 32,000, only Rs. 2,600 was met from fees and the balance was charged to Local funds.\n\nThere were five dispensaries and hospitals in 1903, with accommodation for 64 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 26,000, including 575 in-patients, and 1,100 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 5,400, chiefly met from Local funds.\n\nAbout 21,000 persons were successfully vaccinated in 1903-4, representing the high proportion of 45 per 1,000 of population, although vaccination is not compulsory in any part of the District.\n\n[District Gazetteer, 1874 (under revision); W. E. Neale, Settlement Report, 1880.]\n\nHamirpur Tahsil.\u2014North-eastern tahsil of Hamirpur District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Hamirpur and Sumerpur, and lying between 25\u00b0 42' and 26\u00b0 7' N. and 79\u00b0 51' and 80\u00b0 21' E., with an area of 376 square miles. Population fell from 81,133 in 1891 to 71,625 in 1901. There are 124 villages and two towns: Hamirpur (population, 6,721), the District and tahsil head-quarters, and Sumerpur (4,039). The demand for land revenue in 1904-5 was Rs. 1,34,000, and for cesses Rs. 28,000. The density of population, 190 persons per square mile, is slightly below the District average. On the north flows the Jumna, while the Betw\u0101 runs almost due east through the centre of the tahsil to join it. The soil is chiefly fertile, but becomes lighter near the junction of the two rivers, and a network of ravines fringes the banks of both the Jumna and the Betw\u0101. In 1902-3 only 2 square miles were irrigated, out of 183 square miles under cultivation. The Betw\u0101 Canal serves a small area in the north.\n\nHamirpur Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the District and tahsil of the same name, United Provinces, situated in 25\u00b0 58' N. and 80\u00b0 9' E., on a tongue of land near the confluence of the Betw\u0101 and Jumna, and on the metalled road from Cawnpore to Saugor. Population (1901), 6,721. According to tradition, it was founded in the eleventh century by Hamir Deo, a Karchuli Rajput expelled from Alwar by the Muhammads. Under Akbar it was the head-quarters of a mahal or pargana. The ruins of Hamir's fort and a few Musalm\u0101n tombs are the only relics of antiquity. Several Europeans were murdered here during the Mutiny. Besides the usual public offices, there is a dispensary. The\ntown is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 2,100. There is a little trade in grain. The District school has 64 pupils, and a middle school 142.\n\nHamirpur Tahsil.\u2014Tahsil of Kangra District, Punjab, lying between $31^\\circ 25'$ and $31^\\circ 58'$ N. and $76^\\circ 9'$ and $76^\\circ 44'$ E., with an area of 602 square miles. It is bounded on the south by Bilaspur State and on the east by Mandi State, and lies between the Beas on the north and the Sutlej on the south. The north-east corner is rugged and inaccessible, and the Sola Singhi range runs along the south-west border. Broken masses of hills cover almost all the tahsil, but in some parts there are stretches of fairly level ground. The population in 1901 was 161,424, compared with 162,705 in 1891. It contains 64 villages, including Hamirpur, the head-quarters, and Sujanpur Tira. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to 1-9 lakhs.\n\nHampi.\u2014Village in Bellary District, Madras. Site of Vijayanagar.\n\nH\u0101m\u016bn-i-Lora. A depression in the Ch\u0101gai District of Baluchist\u0101n, lying between $29^\\circ 8'$ and $29^\\circ 37'$ N. and $64^\\circ 44'$ and $64^\\circ 59'$ E. It is about 38 miles long, with an average breadth of 6 miles. It receives the spill of the Pishin Lora, but, except after heavy rains, can be crossed in any direction. The surface is white and impregnated with salt. Small rocky hills rise to the south, the principal being Kaft\u0101r and Gaukoh.\n\nH\u0101m\u016bn-i-M\u0101shkel.\u2014A large depression on the western frontier of Baluchist\u0101n, lying between $28^\\circ 2'$ and $28^\\circ 30'$ N. and $62^\\circ 36'$ and $63^\\circ 27'$ E. Its length from east to west is about 54 miles, and its breadth varies from 8 to 22 miles. It receives drainage from the south, east, and north, the principal supplies being from the M\u0101shkel and Morjen rivers. There is never much water in it except for a short time after heavy rain. The greater part is covered with white saline efflorescence, and at W\u0101d-i-Sult\u0101n is a small area containing good hard salt. On the north-west, and forming a separate basin, lies the H\u0101m\u016bn-i-Tahl\u0101b.\n\nHanamkonda.\u2014Head-quarters of the Warangal Division and District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in $18^\\circ 1'$ N. and $79^\\circ 34'$ E., near the stations of K\u0101zipet and Warangal on the Niz\u0101m's State Railway. Population (1901), 10,487. According to local tradition, it was the capital of the surrounding country before the foundation of Warangal. The Prat\u0101p Charitri, a Telugu work, says that a Ch\u0101lukya king reigned at Nandagiri (N\u0101nder), on whose death the kingdom was divided between his two sons, one ruling at Hanamkonda and the other at Kandah\u0101r. Ballahundu, king of Cuttack, having killed Somadeo, the king of Kandah\u0101r, Siriyal Dev\u012b, wife of the latter, fled to Hanamkonda, and gave birth to a posthumous son, M\u0101dhava Varma, who succeeded to the throne as the first king of the K\u0101kat\u012bya line. This event is placed about A.D. 314, but the K\u0101kat\u012byas are not referred to in authentic\nrecords before the middle of the twelfth century (see Warangal District). Hanamkonda contains some very interesting buildings, of which the 'thousand-pillared' temple is specially noteworthy. It was built in 1162 in the Ch\u0101lukyan style by the last Hindu dynasty, and consists of three spacious detached halls with a portico supported by nearly 300 pillars. Opposite the portico is a star-shaped mandapa supported on 200 pillars, three of which bear old Telugu and Sanskrit inscriptions. Near the temple is a fine well. Around Hanamkonda several Jain figures are cut in the rocks, close to the ruined town of Hanmantgiri. There are two large tanks on each side of the town.\n\nThe modern town of Hanamkonda extends from near K\u0101zipet on the west to Mathw\u0101d\u0101 on the east. It contains the offices of the S\u016bbahd\u0101r, the Divisional and District civil courts, the District and Irrigation Engineer's offices, the survey office, several schools, a Central jail, the T\u0101lukd\u0101r's offices, a large dispensary and two Yun\u0101ni dispensaries, an American Mission school and hospital, and a District post office.\n\nHandi\u0101.\u2014North-eastern tahsil of Allah\u0101b\u0101d District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Mah and Kiwai, and lying between 25\u00b0 16' and 25\u00b0 36' N. and 82\u00b0 2' and 82\u00b0 21' E., along the northern bank of the Ganges, with an area of 287 square miles. Population fell from 187,089 in 1891 to 183,281 in 1901. There are 582 villages, but no town. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 3,24,000, and for cesses Rs. 52,000. The density of population, 639 persons per square mile, is considerably above the District average. Most of the tahsil consists of two depressions, in which rice is largely grown. These are situated in the upland, and are separated by a high ridge. There is a little alluvial land near the Ganges. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 186 square miles, of which 88 were irrigated, tanks or jhils supplying nearly one-third of the total, and wells the remainder.\n\nH\u0101ngal T\u0101luka.\u2014South-eastern taluka of Dh\u0101rw\u0101r District, Bombay, lying between 14\u00b0 35' and 14\u00b0 55' N. and 75\u00b0 1' and 75\u00b0 20' E., with an area of 300 square miles. It contains one town, H\u0101ngal (population, 6,853), the head-quarters; and 156 villages. The population in 1901 was 77,784, compared with 74,506 in 1891. The density, 259 persons per square mile, slightly exceeds the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was nearly 2 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 15,000. The country is covered with small hills overgrown with vegetation. The climate is temperate and healthy. There are numerous irrigation tanks.\n\nH\u0101ngal Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in Dh\u0101rw\u0101r District, Bombay, situated in 14\u00b0 46' N. and 75\u00b0 8' E., about 50 miles south of Dh\u0101rw\u0101r town. Population (1901), 6,853. The most interesting temple is dedicated to T\u0101rakeshwar. About 600 yards west of modern H\u0101ngal is a remarkable conical mound known as\nKuntina Dibba, or 'Kunti's hillock.' H\u0101ngal, called Vir\u0101tkot, Vir\u0101tnagari, and P\u0101nungal in inscriptions, is locally believed to be a place where the P\u0101ndavas lived during part of their exile from Delhi. Until conquered by the Hoysala king Ball\u0101l II about 1200, H\u0101ngal was governed by the dynasty of the Kadambas as vassals of the Western Ch\u0101lukyas. The town contains a dispensary and three schools, of which one is for girls.\n\n**Hangu Tahsil** (or Mir\u0101nzai).\u2014Western tahsil of Koh\u0101t District, North-West Frontier Province, lying between $33^\\circ 19'$ and $33^\\circ 36'$ N. and $70^\\circ 30'$ and $71^\\circ 13'$ E., with an area of 546 square miles. It consists of the Mir\u0101nzai valley, inhabited by a tribe of Bangash Path\u0101ns, and is divided into the tappas of Upper and Lower Mir\u0101nzai. Lower Mir\u0101nzai slopes east towards Koh\u0101t, the valley being bounded on the north by the S\u0101m\u0101na range which separates it from Orakzai Tir\u0101h, and on the south by the low hills of the District, of which Mir Khweli (4,500 feet) is the highest. Upper Mir\u0101nzai slopes west towards the Kurram. On the north are the hills of the Ali Khel Orakzai, the M\u0101muzai, and the Zaimukhts, and on the south the Khattak hills. Both valleys are watered by perennial streams and are fertile, while the hills provide excellent grazing for sheep and goats. Upper or Western Mir\u0101nzai was annexed in 1851, but British administration was not established till 1855. The population of the whole tahsil in 1901 was 43,901, compared with 39,704 in 1891. It contains 43 villages, including Hangu, the head-quarters. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 36,000.\n\n**Hangu Village.**\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Koh\u0101t District, North-West Frontier Province, situated in $33^\\circ 32'$ N. and $71^\\circ 5'$ E. The officer in charge of the Thal subdivision has his headquarters here. The site is a very old one, and is mentioned by the emperor B\u0101bar in his memoirs. The Khush\u0101lgarh-Koh\u0101t-Thal branch of the North-Western Railway has a station at Hangu, 26 miles from Koh\u0101t. The garrison consists of a detachment of Native cavalry, the head-quarters of the S\u0101m\u0101na Rifles, and (in winter) two guns of a mountain battery. The village contains a Government dispensary and a vernacular middle school maintained by the District board.\n\n**Hansi Tahsil.**\u2014Tahsil of Hiss\u0101r District, Punjab, lying between $28^\\circ 51'$ and $29^\\circ 27'$ N. and $75^\\circ 48'$ and $76^\\circ 20'$ E., with an area of 799 square miles. The population in 1901 was 178,933, compared with 165,689 in 1891. It contains the town of Hansi (population, 16,523), the head-quarters; and 132 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to 2 lakhs. The whole of the tahsil lies within the tract known as Hari\u0101na. The northern part is irrigated by the Western Jumna Canal, and is comparatively well wooded. South of the canal the country is featureless, but fertile enough in a year of good rainfall.\nH\u0101nsi Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Hiss\u0101r District, Punjab, situated in 29\u00b0 7' N. and 75\u00b0 58' E., on the Rew\u0101ri-Bhatinda branch of the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway, 15 miles from Hiss\u0101r. Population (1901), 16,523. This is one of the most ancient towns in Northern India, and appears to have been a stronghold of the Kushans, though local tradition attributes its foundation to Anang P\u0101l, the Tomar king of Delhi. According to the authorities quoted in Tod's Rajasth\u0101n, As\u012b or H\u0101nsi was assigned to the son of Biscaldeo Chauh\u0101n about A.D. 1000. Mas\u016bd, son of Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni, took it, after one failure, in 1036, but, according to Firishta, it was recovered by the Delhi R\u0101j\u0101 in 1043. Prithwi R\u0101j made considerable additions to the fort at H\u0101nsi, converting it into an important military stronghold. It fell into the hands of Muhammad of Ghor in 1192, and was, until the foundation of Hiss\u0101r, the administrative head-quarters of the neighbourhood. H\u0101nsi was depopulated by the famine of 1783, and lay deserted until 1798, when the famous adventurer George Thomas, who had seized upon the greater part of Hari\u0101na, fixed his head-quarters here. Thenceforth the town began to revive, and on the establishment of British rule in 1803 it was made a cantonment, where a considerable force, consisting chiefly of local levies, was stationed. In 1857 the troops mutinied, murdered all Europeans upon whom they could lay hands, and combined with the wild R\u0101jput tribes in plundering the country. On the restoration of order, the cantonment was given up. A high brick wall, with bastions and loopholes, surrounds the town, while the canal, which flows at its feet, contributes to its beauty by a fringe of handsome trees. Since the Mutiny, however, the houses have fallen into decay and the streets lie comparatively deserted, owing to the removal of the troops. The ruins of the fort overlook the town on the north. It contains two mosques and the tomb of Sayyid Ni\u0101mat Ullah, killed in resisting Muhammad of Ghor. The mosque and tombs of Kutb Jam\u0101l-ud-din and his successors are on the west of the town, with the tomb of Ali Mir Tij\u0101ra. Near by is a mosque called the Shahid Ganj, situated probably on the scene of Mas\u016bd's first unsuccessful attempt to take H\u0101nsi.\n\nThe municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 18,500, and the expenditure Rs. 18,800. In 1903\u20134 the income and expenditure were Rs. 30,000 and Rs. 20,000 respectively, the chief source of income being octroi. The town has 6 cotton-ginning factories, 2 cotton-presses, and 2 combined ginning and pressing factories, and is a local centre of the cotton trade. The number of factory hands in 1904 was 1,285. It possesses a vernacular middle school and a dispensary.\n\nH\u0101nsot.\u2014Town in the Anklesvar taluka of Broach District, Bombay, situated in 21\u00b0 35' N. and 72\u00b0 48' E., on the left bank of the\nNarbad\u0101, about 15 miles south-west of Broach city. Population (1901), 3,925. H\u0101nsot was formerly the head-quarters of a taluka of the same name, acquired by the British in 1775, restored to the Peshw\u0101 in 1783, and again acquired in 1803. The municipality, established in 1889, had an average income of about Rs. 5,000 during the decade ending 1901. In 1903-4 its income was Rs. 4,377. The town contains a dispensary and four schools, three (including an English school) for boys and one for girls, attended respectively by 245 and 35 pupils.\n\nHanthawaddy.\u2014District in the Pegu Division of Lower Burma, lying between $16^\\circ 19'$ and $17^\\circ 47'$ N. and $95^\\circ 45'$ and $96^\\circ 45'$ E., with an area of 3,023 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Tharrawaddy District; on the east by Pegu District; and on the west by Ma-ubin and Pyapon. The southern boundary stretches along the Gulf of Martaban between the mouths of the Sittang and the To, or China Bakir, rivers. In the centre and completely surrounded by it is the separate District of Rangoon City, in which the District offices are situated. The Cocos and Preparis Islands in the Bay of Bengal form part of the District.\n\nHanthawaddy is a vast deltaic plain stretching up from the sea, broken only by spurs of the Pegu Yoma, which separates the northern portion of the District from Pegu. The spurs continue as undulating ground through the Insein subdivision, and rise slightly near Rangoon, where the summit of a small hill has been levelled to form the platform of the Shwedagon pagoda. The range appears again on the opposite side of the Pegu river at Syriam, and is finally lost in the rocks in the Hmawwun stream just opposite the village of Kyauktan. A similar ridge of high land runs from Twante to Kungyangon in the west of the District. The highest point in the Yoma has an altitude of 2,000 feet. Here the hills are clothed with fine evergreen forests, and the scenery is bold and interesting. Farther south the high land is covered with fruit gardens and, near Rangoon, is being much sought after for house sites. Excluding this portion of the District, the scenery is tame and monotonous, consisting of rice cultivation and swamp relieved by scrub jungle, and along the sea-coast and the numerous water-ways by mangrove and inferior forest growth interspersed with dani plantations. The coast-line is low, and at the ebb shows large dismal stretches of mud.\n\nThe main stream is the Hlaing (known farther north as the Myitmak\u0101), which enters the District at its northern end and runs southwards through its entire length. The Hlaing, which is navigable by native craft through the whole of its course within the limits of the District, is joined in the neighbourhood of Rangoon by the Pegu river\nand the Pazundaung stream from the north-east and north, and thence flows southwards under the name of the Rangoon river into the Gulf of Martaban. The District is further intersected by numerous tidal creeks, all navigable by country boats and many by river steamers. The most important of these are the Thatkutpin or Bassein creek, which connects the Rangoon river with the To, and thus with the main stream of the Irrawaddy; the Panhkaing, which during the rains, when the water is high, takes the place of the Bassein creek as the most direct route to the Irrawaddy; the Bawle river, which divides Hanthawaddy from the adjoining District of Ma-ubin; and the Hmawwun, which taps the rich rice-fields of the Kyauktan subdivision.\n\nThe plains of the delta are composed of homogeneous post-Tertiary alluvium resting on a bed of water-worn gravel, which is often found at a depth of less than 250 feet and is a good water-bearing stratum. Along the skirts of the Pegu Yoma a broad bed of sandy deposit occurs; and laterite, which is largely used for road-metalling, is found in many of the lower hills, mixed with red alluvial clay. Occasionally partially rolled pieces of fossil wood are met with. The Yoma itself is formed of beds of the Pegu group, of miocene age.\n\nThe coast-line is fringed with dense low mangrove jungle, covered regularly by the tide, and characterized specially by species of Bruguiera and Rhizophora. Behind these forests and along the borders of the tidal channels are the tidal forests, the most characteristic trees of which are Sonneratia apetala and Avicennia tomentosa. These forests average 40 to 50 feet in height, and have a thick shrubby growth, similar to that of the mangrove forests. Nipa fruticans and Pandanus foetidus form dense bushes, and Phoenix paludosa is very common. Creepers and climbers abound, including Acanthus volubilis, Flagellaria indica, &c. Behind this zone are either open evergreen tropical or low deciduous forests. Among the former are found Parashorea stellata, Pentacle burmanica, Albizzia lucida, Lagerstroemia tomentosa, and Dillenia parviflora, and many varieties of shrubs and climbers. The low deciduous forests contain Dillenia pulcherrima, Shorea leucobotrya, Pentacle siamensis, Melanorrhoea usitata, Xylia dolabriformis, Lagerstroemia macrocarpa, Albizzia lucida, and Strychnos Nux-vomica. The undergrowth is usually composed of scanty andropogonous grasses. The savannah forests are distinguished by the great growth of elephant-grasses, among which the trees grow up apart from one another; they include Butea frondosa, Ficus fistulosa, Terminalia crenata, Dalbergia cultrata, Dalbergia purpurcea, Lagerstroemia Flos Regiae, and Strychnos Nux-vomica.\n\nIn the Yoma, elephants, bison, tsine or hsaing (Bos sondaicus), and various kinds of deer are common; rhinoceros are rare. There are indications that tigers and leopards are increasing in consequence\nof the disarmament of the country, and their frequent appearance near Rangoon and the railway has lately caused annoyance. The fish-eating monkey and the short-nosed crocodile are at times seen along the tidal creeks.\n\nThe climate is moist and depressing, but on the whole not unhealthy. From the middle of March until the rains break in May the heat is excessive; and at the end of the rains, in September and October, the nights are oppressive, and the days often muggy and trying. December and January are cool and pleasant, the average minimum being about $60^\\circ$. The southern portion of the District is cooled by the sea-breeze, and the maximum temperature, which varies between $83^\\circ$ and $95^\\circ$, increases in the north towards the drier zone of Tharrawaddy.\n\nThe average annual rainfall at the recording stations is as follows: 9.4 inches at Insein, 98 inches at Rangoon, and 119 inches at Kyauktan. The rainy season lasts, as elsewhere, from May to October inclusive; a spell of two or three days' rain in early spring is not uncommon, and is a source of great inconvenience to the cultivators, whose grain at this time is usually on the unprotected threshing-floors.\n\nThe country to the west of the Hlaing river is subject to inundation, especially in the north of the District. There were floods disastrous to cultivation in 1877, which have recurred in a smaller degree on several occasions. Abnormally high spring-tides, when the wind is in the south, sometimes damage the rice-fields bordering the sea. The District is, however, safe from famine, as the water-supply, although poor in many places in the dry season, is seldom seriously deficient.\n\nThe name Hanthawaddy is derived from *hantha* or *hintha* (the Br\u00e4hmani goose) and *wadi*, P\u0101li for 'river.' Legend has it that in the south of the District in prehistoric days only the hill upon which the Shwedagon pagoda now stands was above sea-level, and that it once afforded a resting-place for a Gautama, who, in a previous incarnation, had been caught in the shape of a *hintha* in a storm in the neighbourhood of the eminence.\n\nIn early historic days Hanthawaddy, like the rest of the country lying round the Gulf of Martaban, formed part of the kingdom of the Talaings. Shortly after the close of the sixteenth century, when the Talaings had for the time been subjugated by the Burmans, and when the Toungoo dynasty reigned in the old Talaing capital of Pegu, Syriam, in Hanthawaddy District, was one of the earliest European trading stations in Burma. The only remains of this early settlement which now exist are the fragments of the old city walls and the ruins of the church built outside the old town of Syriam in 1750 by the Vicar Apostolic of Ava and Pegu. These are now preserved by Government. Hanthawaddy passed, with the rest of the province\nof Pegu, under British dominion at the close of the second Burmese War. It was separated from Rangoon and made into a separate District in 1879. In 1883 it was split up into two on the creation of Pegu District, and in 1895 its limits were enlarged by the addition of the Kyauktan subdivision. With the expansion of Rangoon, various alterations of the boundary between the city and Hanthawaddy have been rendered necessary. The last revision was made in 1903.\n\nThere are several important pagodas. The Kyaikkauk pagoda is built on the low hills on the left bank of the Rangoon river 4 miles south of Syriem. It is said to have been erected to enshrine two hairs of Gautama; later, a bone of Gautama's forehead and one of his teeth were presented to the shrine. The Kyaikkasan pagoda lies about 3 miles north-east of the Shwedagon in Rangoon, and is of the same period as that at Kyaikkauk. The Shwesandaw, near Twante, is the most sacred of the local Talaing pagodas. It was built as a shrine for two of Gautama's hairs, to which four more hairs were subsequently added. Other sacred edifices of importance are the Kyaukwaing pagoda, 2 miles east of Thamaing railway station; and the Kyaikkalo pagoda, 14 miles north of Rangoon.\n\nThe population of the District at the last four enumerations was: (1872) 186,967, (1881) 296,026, (1891) 396,887, and (1901) 484,811. The distribution according to townships in 1901 is shown in the following table:\n\n| Township     | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|--------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Taikkyi      | 898                  | ...             | 470      | 73,263     | 81                        | + 52                                                     | 20,385                                 |\n| Insein       | 482                  | 1               | 478      | 103,984    | 216                       | + 21                                                     | 31,947                                 |\n| Twante       | 369                  | ...             | 343      | 85,441     | 231                       | + 24                                                     | 26,026                                 |\n| Kungyangon   | 453                  | ...             | 263      | 71,017     | 157                       | + 12                                                     | 23,447                                 |\n| Kyauktan     | 403                  | ...             | 173      | 52,065     | 120                       | + 33                                                     | 19,300                                 |\n| Thabyegan    | 314                  | ...             | 155      | 51,390     | 164                       | + 1                                                      | 32,755                                 |\n| Thongwa      | 104                  | ...             | 174      | 47,051     | 458                       |                                                          |                                        |\n| District total | 3,023                | 1              | 2,056    | 484,811    | 160                       | + 22                                                     | 152,960                                |\n\nNote.\u2014The Thongwa township was constituted after the Census of 1901.\n\nUp to 1891 the rate of increase, chiefly owing to immigration from India, averaged about 100,000 for each decade. During the last decade progress has been rather slower, but there has been a total gain of 22 per cent. Hanthawaddy has now more inhabitants than any District in the Province, and is one of the most thickly populated. Despite its density, it contains but one town (Insein) of over 5,000 inhabitants, and only five villages of over 2,000. The population\nis thus almost wholly rural. There were 10,000 immigrants from India residing in the District in 1891 and 43,800 in 1901, three-fourths of whom were Madrasis. Buddhism is the religion of the great majority of the inhabitants; but after Rangoon City Hanthawaddy has the largest number of Hindus (39,500) of any District in the Province, and its total of Musalmans is lower only than those of Akyab, Rangoon, Amherst, and Mandalay. The Hindus are for the most part agricultural labourers and coolies from Madras. Burmese is the language ordinarily spoken. Practically all the persons returned as Karens at the enumeration speak the Karen language; but of the Shans only about half, and of the Talaings only a minute proportion, have retained their own vernacular. Of Indian languages, Tamil and Telugu are the most widely spoken.\n\nThe majority of the inhabitants are Burmans, but in 1901 the Karens numbered 44,100, the Talaings 32,700, and the Shans 15,400. The number of Chinese is large. Nearly 70 per cent. of the total population are engaged in or dependent on agriculture.\n\nThere are 7,440 Christians, nearly half of whom are Baptists, natives numbering 6,840. The Christian missions have their head-quarters in Rangoon; but there is an important branch of the American Baptist Mission at Insein, and several schools of this mission and of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel are maintained in the large villages.\n\nThe two southern subdivisions, Twante and Kyauktan, are practically deltaic islands, and, excluding a ridge known as the Kondan running from Syriam to Kyauktan, and a similar formation between Twante and Kungyangon, consist in the main of flat plains of alluvial soil in which the rice is ordinarily sown broadcast and not transplanted. The same may be said of the western portion of the Insein subdivision as far north as Hmawbi, beyond which the creeks lose their tidal character, and such streams as exist have separate sources in the Pegu Yoma. In this portion of the District the rice is almost always transplanted. In many places large tracts are subject to inundation, but the floods appear to be becoming less destructive and the precarious area more circumscribed.\n\nThe Kondan portion, although suitable for fruit cultivation on its lower slopes, is in the main covered with scrub jungle, and, beyond a small area in which the Shans cut taungyas, is of little value except for bamboo plantations. It is only on and near this high land, which cannot be used for rice, that miscellaneous crops and garden produce are cultivated, although in the immediate vicinity of Rangoon the people are beginning to cultivate vegetables after the rice is reaped, by means of irrigation from unbricked wells. The rainfall, which may be\nroughly taken to average 100 inches per annum, is usually timely, and it is only in the extreme north of the District that partial damage to crops from unseasonable rainfall is in any way marked. There is, however, as has already been noted, an almost yearly loss of rice caused by rain in the early spring, when the cultivators, with their national carelessness, leave the grain unprotected on their threshing-floors.\n\nThe best rice in Burma is said to come from Pyawbwe in the Twante subdivision, and from an agricultural point of view the District may be viewed as a huge paddy-field producing a better average yield than any other part of Burma. No other crop is of any general importance; but the fruit and vegetable gardens, which extend along the Kondan from Rangoon to Insein, and supply the Rangoon market with pineapples, mangoes, jack-fruit, marian plums, betel-nuts, and other fruits and vegetables, may be noticed. The area cultivated in 1891 was 1,473 square miles. The main agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are given below, in square miles:\n\n| Township     | Total area | Cultivated | Forests |\n|--------------|------------|------------|---------|\n| Taikkyi      | 898        | 262        |         |\n| Insein       | 482        | 324        |         |\n| Twante       | 369        | 272        |         |\n| Kungyangon   | 453        | 267        | 639     |\n| Kyauktan     | 403        | 237        |         |\n| Thabyegan    | 314        | 225        |         |\n| Thongwa      | 104        | 199        |         |\n| **Total**    | **3,023**  | **1,780**  | **639** |\n\nThe area under garden crops in 1903-4 was 55 square miles, mostly in the Insein and Twante townships, while 3,000 acres were planted with the *dani* palm.\n\nThe area under rice increases yearly; but good waste land is becoming exhausted except in the Taikkyi township, where large tracts to the east of the railway are still available for cultivation, and in the extreme south, where certain fuel reserves have lately been thrown open and island formations occur. The average size of a holding is large. At the revision settlement it was found to be over 40 acres. Comparatively little is done to improve the quality of the crops by systematic methods. No applications have been recently made by the cultivators for loans under the Agriculturists' Loans Act, but advances under the Act have been made from time to time in the past.\n\nThe agricultural stock is for the most part of the ordinary Burmese breed. Indian cattle imported from Calcutta are, however, becoming not uncommon. This is especially noticeable along the railway, where large settlements of natives of India are employed in supplying milk to\nRangoon. Kine are more numerous than buffaloes. The area reserved for grazing purposes is 109,000 acres, and it is only where natives of India are breeding large herds of cattle for milking that any real difficulty in feeding the live-stock exists.\n\nBeyond the ordinary system of field embankments and the garden cultivation effected by means of unbricked wells near Rangoon, there is no regular irrigation in Hanthawaddy. A large reservoir has recently been constructed at Hlawga, 15 miles north of Rangoon, from which the water-supply of that city is drawn, and there are many village tanks of local importance. The fisheries of the District lie for the most part on the west, towards the Irrawaddy delta; they are all either in the beds of streams or in shallow depressions filled by the overflow from the waterways. Of the former kind there are 58 and of the latter 41. The largest fisheries are the East and West Gayetami in the Twante township.\n\nThe area of 'reserved' forest in 1904 was 394 square miles, and of 'unclassed' forests about 245 square miles. The latter are rapidly diminishing, as cultivation extends and clearances are made by excessive cutting for fuel for Rangoon.\n\nForests. The hill forests cover the western slopes of the Yoma, and include large tracts of evergreen forests, in which teak and pyingado (Xylia dolabriformis) are found. Past records extending back to 1857 show that these forests were once very rich in teak; but much of this valuable timber has been extracted, and they now compare unfavourably with the forests on the eastern slopes of the same range in Pegu District. The plain forests consist of non-tidal and tidal growths. The former extend from the foot of the Yoma on undulating land, and are almost wholly in the Insein subdivision. Characteristic trees are chiefly deciduous, but evergreen forest is found along some of the streams. In the moister localities pyinma (Lagerstroemia Flos Reginae) and kanyinni (Dipterocarpus laevis) are the principal trees, and elsewhere teak, pyingado (Xylia dolabriformis), and in (Dipterocarpus tuberculatus). The teak is usually of poor quality, and much of the pyingado was used up for sleepers when the railway to Prome was being made. Large portions of the tidal forests have been reserved for fuel, but many rights in these Reserves exist, and they have been largely cut over. They are now not capable of supplying the demands of Rangoon, which must in future look to the plain forests in the Insein subdivision for the immense quantity of wood required for domestic purposes and brickmaking. There are 2,767 acres of teak plantations, dating from 1868. In 1900 a plantation of 30 acres of Para rubber trees was made near Rangoon, but its growth is not promising. The forest receipts in 1901 amounted to Rs. 71,155, including Rs. 35,799 from firewood and charcoal. In 1904 they were nearly Rs. 1,15,000.\nLaterite and pottery clay are produced, but otherwise the mineral resources are unimportant. Laterite, which is largely used for road-metalling, is distributed along the Kondans, and is extracted by manual labour, Indian coolies being usually employed at a wage of 8 annas or more a day. The cost per 100 cubic feet delivered in Rangoon is Rs. 14, but the price varies with the cost of carriage. The annual out-turn is estimated at 22,000 tons. Ordinary alluvial clay is extensively excavated for brickmaking, and at Twante a superior kind is found, suitable for pottery.\n\nCotton-weaving on a small scale is carried on everywhere, but the people are gradually giving up their own hand-made cloth for European goods, which can now be bought in all the large villages. Silk-weaving as a local industry has almost entirely disappeared. Salt is manufactured at Tanmanaing in the Kungyangon township from sea-water, which is boiled in cauldrons after being passed over successive drying pans. The out-turn paying duty in 1903 was 46,600 cwt., which was almost entirely used locally in preserving fish in the shape of fish-paste (ngapi). Pots for salt-boiling are made in Kungyangon. At Twante large water and oil jars, often standing 4 feet high, and commonly known as Pegu jars, are made. They are glazed with a mixture of rice water and galena. Coarse mats used for packing are woven from bamboo in the Twante subdivision, and a finer kind for domestic use in parts of the Insein subdivision. Wood-chopping and other das, sickles, axes, and other ironwork for local use are made in many of the larger villages.\n\nThere are seven rice-mills in the District, almost all just outside Rangoon City, or within easy reach of it by water. Their annual out-turn is estimated at 64,000 tons, which all goes to the Rangoon market for export. Near the Pugyi and Palon railway stations are two small saw-mills supplying the local market, and at Insein are the workshops of the Burma Railways Company, which employ 2,500 men. The Burma Oil Company's refinery at Syriam is the most important factory in the District, employing a staff of 22 Europeans and 3,150 natives. The crude oil is brought down in tank-steamer flats from Upper Burma, and is refined by the process known as continuous distillation. It is then stored in large steel tanks, and pumped through a 5-mile pipeline to the tank-steamers belonging to the company in the Rangoon river. It is also shipped in smaller quantities in tins and casks.\n\nThe trade of the District centres in Rangoon, but there are markets at Twante, Thongwa, Paukkon, and elsewhere. Excluding teak and other forest produce, extracted under the supervision of Government, rice may be regarded as composing the entire export. The grain is bought up by brokers of the large Rangoon firms at local centres all over the District, and is brought to the mills by boat or rail. The\nuse of large barges of European pattern, manned by natives of India, and often towed by small launches, is becoming general on the tidal creeks, and the number of Burmese craft in these waters is decreasing. Beyond this, the only export trade is the daily supply of the Rangoon market with fuel, milk, fruit, vegetables, and a little live-stock, principally pigs. The greater part of the fuel is brought in logs by boat from the tidal forests, but a considerable amount of charcoal is manufactured in the Taikkyi township, and comes into Rangoon by rail. The principal imports are piece-goods, salt, oil, sugar, hardware, oilman's stores, gunny-bags, rope, and miscellaneous goods. These are all obtained from the Rangoon markets, and are retailed in the local bazars and shops by Burmese, Chinese, and Indian traders.\n\nWithin the District there are 70 miles of railway, nearly 200 miles of metalled roads, and 30 miles of fair-weather cart-roads. Of these the Rangoon-Prome trunk road, the Dala-Twante road, and some branch roads (in all, 109 miles) are maintained from Provincial funds, and the remainder from the District cess fund. The Insein subdivision is served by the Rangoon-Prome railway, which runs through it from south to north for a distance of 60 miles, and the south-east corner by the Rangoon-Mandalay line, which leaves the District 3 miles to the north of Togyaungale railway station. The main water-communications are the Hlaing river, which runs almost parallel to the railway on the west, and has numerous tributaries, the Twante Canal, and the Bawle, Panhlaing, and other creeks connecting the Hlaing with the eastern mouth of the Irrawaddy.\n\nExcept for the roads from Kyauktan to Syriam and Thabyegan, and from Twante to Dala and Kungyangon, the Twante and Kyauktan subdivisions depend almost entirely on water carriage. The Twante Canal shortens the distance by the Kanaungto creek between Rangoon and the To river, and, although shallow, is much used by small river steamers and boats, being the quickest route from Rangoon to the main stream of the Irrawaddy. A small drainage canal at Kayan, in the north of the Kyauktan subdivision, is navigable by boats in the rains. The Irrawaddy Flotilla Company has a daily service of steamers from Rangoon to Thongwa via Kyauktan, and from Rangoon to Twante through the canal. Launches run daily from Rangoon up the Pegu river to Kamamat, and down the Rangoon river to villages in the Kungyangon township. A regular service is maintained on the Hlaing, where, in the rains, launches ply as far north as Sanywe in Tharrawaddy District. A steam ferry plies several times daily between Syriam and Rangoon, and there are boat ferries on all the chief lines of communication.\n\nThe District is divided into three subdivisions: Insein, comprising the Taikkyi and Insein townships; Kyauktan, comprising the\nKyauktan, Thabyegan, and Thongwa townships; and Twante, comprising the Twante and Kungyangon townships. They are under the usual executive officers, assisted by 799 village headmen (361 of whom have no part in the collection of revenue), but there still remain twenty-three of the old revenue circles under circle thagris. Of the headmen, 7 have special criminal and 28 civil powers under the Village Act. The headquarters are at Rangoon, where the Deputy-Commissioner is assisted by a treasury officer and an akumawun (in charge of the revenue). The land records staff consists of a superintendent, 8 inspectors, and 106 surveyors, the District being under supplementary survey. The excise staff is under a superintendent, subject to the control of the Deputy-Commissioner. The District forms a Public Works division, with three subdivisions conterminous with the civil subdivisions. It is likewise co-extensive with the Rangoon Forest division.\n\nHanthawaddy forms part of the Hanthawaddy Sessions division, and sessions cases are tried by the Divisional Judge. The District (civil) court is presided over by a whole-time District Judge. One civil township judge tries the cases in the three township courts in the Kyauktan subdivision. The other townships each have a special civil township judge. The township judges at Insein, Kyauktan, and Twante exercise Small Cause Court jurisdiction within these three towns.\n\nThe criminal work is heavy; and two additional magistrates are employed, one (regularly) at Insein, and one (occasionally) at Kyauktan, to try cases during the open season, when the subdivisional and township officers (who ordinarily perform the magisterial work of their charges) are on tour. These officers have no territorial jurisdiction proper, but cases are transferred to them for trial by the District and subdivisional magistrates. The statistics of crime fluctuate year by year. Boat-robberies and dacoities were once very prevalent in the delta, but of late years these forms of crime have been less common, and housebreaking appears to have taken their place. Similarly, cattle-theft, for which Insein was once notorious, is now not particularly prevalent, although still far from extinct. The numerous waterways make smuggling easy, and offences against the opium and excise laws show little signs of falling off.\n\nNumerous territorial changes in Hanthawaddy District make it exceedingly difficult to trace the growth of the revenue derived from land. The first regular settlement commenced in 1879\u201380, in what is now the Kyauktan subdivision, and was completed in 1884 with the settlement of a part of the Insein subdivision; but it was not until 1895, when the Kyauktan subdivision was transferred to Hanthawaddy, that the District as now constituted was formed. Since 1897 the\nsettlement of all three subdivisions has been revised, and the present settlements will expire in 1910-1.\n\nAt the time of annexation the principal taxes (excluding customs collected at Rangoon) of Rangoon District were capitation, land (per yoke of oxen), fisheries, and salt taxes. These imposts were continued by the British Government, but at fixed rates per acre for land, the old assessment being quite arbitrary. Many grants under the liberal waste-land grant rules of 1865 have been made. Thirty-nine of these grants in different stages of assessment exist (from the minimum rate of 4 annas per acre to the maximum of Rs. 1-8 per acre when the land becomes permanently settled), covering an area of 37,346 acres. The largest of these are a grant of over 4,000 acres in the Twante circle, and the Tawkayan grant of 2,500 acres in the Kungyangon township. The Cocos and Preparis Islands are leased under special arrangements for the collection of coco-nuts and fibre. The highest assessments on first-class rice land are Rs. 4-8 per acre in part of the Kungyangon township, Rs. 4-4 in certain portions of the Kyauktan subdivision, and Rs. 4 on land to the east of the railway in the Insein subdivision. On second-class soil the minimum rate is Rs. 1-4. The average assessment for rice land may be taken at about Rs. 3-8. Garden land is assessed at from Rs. 1-4 to Rs. 6-0 an acre. Dani pays Rs. 5 an acre, and betel-vine from Rs. 7-8 to Rs. 10.\n\nAccurate statistics of revenue for the years prior to 1890-1 are not available. The following are the figures from 1890-1 onwards, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 9,82   | 30,12  | 34,29  |\n| Total revenue  | 14,51  | 39,60  | 47,88  |\n\nThe total revenue for 1903-4 includes 4\u00b78 lakhs from capitation tax and 1\u00b78 lakhs from fisheries.\n\nThe District cess fund is administered by the Deputy-Commissioner for the construction and maintenance of roads and the provision of other local needs. It is provided mainly by a levy of 10 per cent. on the total land revenue; and in 1903-4 the income was Rs. 4,12,000 and the expenditure Rs. 4,41,000, mainly devoted to public works (Rs. 2,52,000). There are no municipalities. Insein was declared a 'notified area' in the early part of 1903, and a committee has been formed.\n\nThere are three lighthouses in the District\u2014the China Bakir, Eastern Grove, and Table Island. The China Bakir is an iron-framed structure, standing on the edge of the flats at the end of the China Bakir or\nTo river in $16^\\circ 17'$ N. and $96^\\circ 11'$ E. It was lighted originally in 1869, and was dismantled and erected in its present position on steel piles in 1901. The lighthouse shows a dioptric white light of the first order, fixed and flashing. The focal plane of the light is 74 feet above water-level. The Eastern Grove lighthouse stands on the east of the entrance to the Rangoon river, in $16^\\circ 30'$ N. and $96^\\circ 23'$ E. It shows an occulting dioptric white light of the third order, visible at 15 miles in clear weather. The focal plane of the light is 93 feet above high-water level. The structure is of iron, braced on screw piles. The lighthouse was first lighted in 1869 and was altered in 1881. The old light was converted into an occulting light and exhibited on May 9, 1896. The Table Island lighthouse stands on the summit of the south-west end of Table Island, 2 miles from the Great Cocos Island, in $14^\\circ 11'$ N. and $93^\\circ 21'$ E. It shows a dioptric fixed white light of the first order, visible at 20 miles in clear weather. The focal plane of the light is 195 feet above high-water level. The structure is a cast-iron circular tower, painted with alternate red and white bands. The lighthouse was lighted in 1867. There is a signalling station (marked by an obelisk) at Elephant Point, west of the entrance to the Rangoon river.\n\nThe forts guarding the Rangoon river and some of the submarine defences are within the District; they are garrisoned from Rangoon. Insein is an important centre of the Burma Railways Volunteer Corps.\n\nThe civil police force consists of 5 inspectors, 66 head constables and sergeants, and 426 men, under a District Superintendent, with 3 Assistant Superintendents stationed at Insein, Kyauktan, and Twante, the head-quarters of the three police and judicial subdivisions. There are 21 police stations, 9 of which are in the Insein, 5 in the Kyauktan, and 7 in the Twante subdivision. Three officers and 187 men of the Rangoon military police battalion are attached to the District.\n\nThe Central jail at Insein on the west of the railway is the largest prison in Burma, and has accommodation for 2,464 prisoners. It is in charge of a Superintendent, who has under him a staff of 2 Hospital Assistants, 12 jailors, and 67 warders. The principal jail manufactures are cotton-winding, carpentry and carving, cane and bamboo work, blanket and coir-making, and blacksmith's work. The articles produced are supplied to various Government departments, and may be purchased by the general public. The average jail population is 1,810 convicted and 21 under-trial prisoners. There is a reformatory school at Insein, which was moved there from Paungde in 1896, and now has accommodation for 200 boys. There were 82 boys in the school on January 1, 1904, who were employed in gardening, tin and cane-work, weaving, and carpentry. The staff consists of a superintendent three schoolmasters, and two trade inspectors. The\nremoval of this building is under consideration, as it is considered that its proximity to the jail is objectionable.\n\nThe standard of education is fairly high. The proportion of literate males in 1901 was over 48 per cent., and of females 11 per cent., the latter being higher than in any other District of the Province. For both sexes together the proportion is 32 per cent. In 1903-4 there were 3 special, 17 secondary, 397 primary, and 382 elementary (private) schools, with 10,749 pupils (16,231 males and 3,518 females), as compared with 8,888 in 1890-1 and 19,092 in 1900-1. Higher education is largely dependent on the schools in Rangoon. The Burman schools show steady improvement, but the Karen seminaries, although increasing in numbers, remain of an inferior type. There has been a decrease in Tamil and other Indian schools. The only notable educational institution is the Government School of Engineering at Insein, which was established in 1894 to train Burmans for the Public Works department. Several scholarships are tenable in the school, and one appointment as overseer and five as sub-overseers in the Public Works department are presented annually by Government. There is a Survey school at Insein. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 59,900, of which Rs. 16,800 was contributed from Provincial funds and Rs. 37,800 from the District cess fund. The receipts from fees amounted to Rs. 5,300.\n\nHanthawaddy is for medical purposes in charge of the Civil Surgeon, Rangoon, and the people of the District for the most part use the Rangoon hospital. There are, however, three other hospitals with 53 beds, in which 900 in-patients and 18,898 out-patients were treated in 1903, and 339 operations were performed. The income of the hospitals comes mostly from Local funds, which contributed Rs. 7,600 in 1903, while the railway gave Rs. 3,400 to the Insein hospital.\n\nVaccination is nowhere compulsory, and progress has been retarded by the popular practice of inoculation. In all 2,830 persons were successfully vaccinated in 1903-4, or only 6 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n[Captain M. Lloyd, *Rangoon District Gazetteer* (1868); R. G. McKerron, *Settlement Reports* (1900, 1901, and 1902).]\n\n**Hanum\u0101ngarh.**\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in the S\u016bratgarh niz\u0101mat of the State of Bikaner, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in 29\u00b0 35' N. and 74\u00b0 20' E., on the left bank of the Ghaggar river, and on the Jodhpur-Bikaner Railway, 144 miles north-east of Bikaner city. Population (1901), 1,303. There is a post office, a vernacular school attended by 76 boys, and a railway dispensary; but the place is famous for its fort. Its old name was Bhatner, 'the fortress' or 'the habitation' of the Bhattis, who were originally Bh\u0101ti R\u0101jputs, and who after becoming Musalm\u0101ns were called Bhattis. It was styled\nHanum\u0101ngarh in 1805, because it was captured by the Bikaner Darb\u0101r in that year on a Tuesday, a day sacred to the monkey-god. Bhatner is frequently mentioned by the Musalm\u0101n historians; it has been identified as the Bhatia captured by Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni about 1004, but this is doubtful. In 1398 it was taken by Tim\u016br from a Bh\u0101ti chief named Dul Chand, but appears to have been restored to the Bh\u0101tis on their giving a girl of their tribe in marriage to the conqueror. In 1527 it is said to have been acquired by the R\u0101thor R\u0101jputs, and was retaken from them by K\u0101mr\u0101n, the brother of Hum\u0101y\u016bn, in 1549. It was recovered by the Bikaner R\u0101j\u0101 about 1560, and held for about twenty years, when it was seized by the S\u016bbahd\u0101r of Hiss\u0101r. The possession of the fort seems to have changed hands frequently, till in 1805 it was, after a siege of five months, captured by the Bikaner Darb\u0101r from a Bhatti chief named Z\u0101bita Kh\u0101n.\n\n[H. M. Elliot, History of India, vols. ii and iii (1869).]\n\nH\u0101pa.\u2014Petty State in Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\nH\u0101pur Tahsil.\u2014South-eastern tahsil of Meerut District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of H\u0101pur, Sar\u0101w\u0101, Garhmuktesar, and P\u016bth, and lying between 28\u00b0 35' and 28\u00b0 54' N. and 77\u00b0 41' and 78\u00b0 12' E., with an area of 411 square miles. The population rose from 212,047 in 1891 to 243,468 in 1901. There are 292 villages and two towns, H\u0101pur (population, 17,796), the tahsil head-quarters, and Garhmuktesar (7,616). In 1903\u20134 the demand for land revenue was Rs. 4,04,000, and for cesses Rs. 68,000. The density of population is low for this District, being only 592 persons per square mile. On the east there is a considerable area of kh\u0101dar land bordering on the Ganges, which forms the eastern boundary. Above this lies a broad stretch of upland, much of which is intersected by ridges of sand; but irrigation from the An\u016bpshahr branch of the Upper Ganges Canal has rendered the cultivation of most of this productive. In the east the K\u0101li Nadi runs through high bh\u016br\u012b, and other streams flow in narrow deeply cut channels. Many drains have been made to carry off the flood-water from above, but the tract is still precarious. In 1903\u20134 the area under cultivation was 320 square miles, of which 112 were irrigated.\n\nH\u0101pur Town (or H\u0101par).\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Meerut District, United Provinces, situated in 28\u00b0 43' N. and 77\u00b0 47' E., on the metalled road from Meerut to Bulandshahr, and on the Mor\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d-Delhi branch of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. The population rose from 14,977 in 1891 to 17,796 in 1901. Hindus number 10,038 and Musalm\u0101ns 7,518. The town is said to have been called Haripur after Har Dat, the Dor chieftain who founded it late in the tenth century; but another derivation is from h\u0101par, meaning 'the orchard.' It formed part of the j\u0101g\u012br of Perron, the French\ngeneral in the service of the Mar\u0101tha chief Sindhia. He established a system of grants for his disabled veterans, which was maintained by the British for many years. In 1805 Ibr\u0101hm Al\u012b, the tahsild\u0101r, defended the place against Amr Kh\u0101n, the Pind\u0101ri freebooter. During the Mutiny, Wahid\u0101d Kh\u0101n of M\u0101l\u0101garh threatened H\u0101pur, but was obliged to retire by the loyal J\u0101ts of Bhatauna. The town is surrounded by several fine groves, and the site in the centre near the J\u0101ma Masjid, which was built during the reign of Aurangzeb, stands high. Around the town are numerous small excavations often full of stagnant water, and the largest of these is connected with the Chhoi\u0101 N\u0101l\u0101, a tributary of the KAL\u012a NAD\u012a (East), which drains most of the town. The drainage system has been greatly improved of late years. The principal public offices are the tahsil, a dispensary, and an Anglo-vernacular school. The Church Missionary Society and the American Methodist Mission have branches here. H\u0101pur was constituted a municipality in 1872. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 17,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 25,000, chiefly derived from octroi (Rs. 17,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 22,000. There is considerable local trade in sugar, grain, cotton, bamboos, and brass vessels. Two steam cotton-gins employ 263 hands. In 1904 there were 11 schools with 408 pupils.\n\nHaraiy\u0101.\u2014South-western tahsil of Bast\u012b District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Amorh\u0101, Nagar (West), and Bast\u012b (West), and lying along the Gogra, between 26\u00b0 36\u2032 and 27\u00b0 N. and 82\u00b0 13\u2032 and 82\u00b0 43\u2032 E., with an area of 478 square miles. Population fell from 351,609 in 1891 to 333,801 in 1901, this being the only tahsil in the District which showed a decrease. There are 1,461 villages, but no town. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 3,84,000, and for cesses Rs. 73,000. The density of population, 698 persons per square mile, is above the District average. The tahsil lies in the upland area above the Gogra, and is crossed by the Kuw\u0101n\u0101 and several smaller streams. The area under cultivation in 1903\u20134 was 338 square miles, of which 211 were irrigated. Wells supply three-fourths of the irrigated area, and tanks and swamps most of the remainder.\n\nH\u0101raoti and Tonk Agency.\u2014A Political Charge in R\u0101jput\u0101na, comprising the States of B\u016bndi and Tonk and the chiefship of Sh\u0101hpura, lying mostly in the south-east of R\u0101jput\u0101na. The headquarters of the Political Agent are ordinarily at Deoli, a cantonment in the British District of Ajmer. The term \u2018H\u0101raoti\u2019 means the country of the H\u0101ra R\u0101jputs (a sept of the great Chauh\u0101n clan), or, in other words, the territories of B\u016bndi and Kotah. In former times, both these States were under the same Political officer, who was styled Political Agent of H\u0101raoti, but a separate Agent was appointed at\nKotah in 1876. The Tonk State consists of six scattered districts, three in R\u0101jput\u0101na and three in Central India; the latter are to some extent under the political charge of certain officers of the Central India Agency. (See Chhabra, Pir\u0101wa, and Sironj.) The population of the H\u0101raoti and Tonk Agency has varied from 644,480 in 1881 and 739,390 in 1891 to 487,104 in 1901, the decrease of 34 per cent. during the last decade being due chiefly to the famine of 1899-1900 and the severe type of malarial fever which followed it. The total area is 5,178 square miles, and the density of population is 94 persons per square mile, as compared with 76 for R\u0101jput\u0101na as a whole. In point of size the Agency ranks sixth, and as regards population, last among the political divisions of R\u0101jput\u0101na. In 1901 Hindus formed 86 per cent. and Musalm\u0101ns 10 per cent. of the total population. Particulars for the States and the chiefship in the Agency are given below:\n\n| State          | Area in square miles | Population, 1901 | Normal land revenue (kh\u0101ls\u0101), in thousands of rupees |\n|----------------|----------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Bundi          | 2,220                | 171,227          | 3,60                                                |\n| Tonk (R\u0101jput\u0101na)| 1,114                | 143,350          | 7,00                                                |\n| Tonk, Central India | 1,439              | 129,871          |                                                     |\n| Sh\u0101hpura       | 405                  | 42,676           | 1,70                                                |\n| Total          | 5,178                | 487,104          | 12,30                                               |\n\nThere are altogether 2,238 villages and 8 towns; but with the exception of Tonk (38,759) and Bundi (19,313), the latter are very small.\n\nHarappa.\u2014Ancient town in the District and tahsil of Montgomery, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 38' N. and 72\u00b0 52' E., on the North-Western Railway. Population (1901), 1,030. It is identified by Cunningham as the town of the Malli, mentioned in Arrian as that into which a great body of Indians fled for safety, and against which Perdiccas was sent with Alexander's cavalry. The ruins extend over an area three miles in circumference, covered with fragments of large bricks. The principal remains occupy a mound forming an irregular square, with sides about half a mile in length. On the western side, where the mass of ruins lies, the mound rises to a height of 60 feet, and encloses solid walls built of huge bricks, apparently belonging to some extensive building. Coins of early date have been picked up amongst the d\u00e9bris. Tradition assigns the foundation of the ancient city to an eponymous R\u0101j\u0101 Harappa. The place is now a village of no importance, but was once the head-quarters of a tahsil.\n\nHarchoka.\u2014Village in the Ch\u0101ng Bhak\u0101r State, Central Provinces, situated in 23\u00b0 52' N. and 81\u00b0 43' E., on the Muw\u0101hi river close\nto the northern boundary of the State. The remains of extensive rock excavations, supposed to be temples and monasteries, were discovered here in 1870-1; they appear to be the work of a more civilized race than the present inhabitants of the State.\n\n**Hard\u0101 Tahsil.**\u2014Western tahsil of Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d District, Central Provinces, lying between $21^\\circ 53'$ and $22^\\circ 35'$ N. and $76^\\circ 47'$ and $77^\\circ 31'$ E., with an area, in 1901, of 1,483 square miles. The population in that year was 131,438, compared with 143,839 in 1891. In 1904, 38 villages and the K\u0101libh\u012bt tract of 'reserved' forest were transferred to Nim\u0101r, and the revised totals of area and population are 1,139 square miles and 128,858 persons. The density is 113 persons per square mile. The tahsil contains one town, Hard\u0101 (population, 16,300), the head-quarters; and 400 inhabited villages. Excluding 279 square miles of Government forest, 78 per cent. of the available area is occupied for cultivation. The cultivated area in 1903-4 was 521 square miles. The demand for land revenue in the same year was Rs. 2,28,000, and for cesses Rs. 22,000. The northern portion of the tahsil consists of a level plain fully cultivated, with black soil of great depth and fertility. In the west there are some low hills, while to the south the S\u0101tpur\u0101 range runs through the tahsil. The small Feudatory State of Makrai lies in the centre.\n\n**Hard\u0101 Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name, Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d District, Central Provinces, situated in $22^\\circ 21'$ N. and $77^\\circ 6'$ E., on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, 417 miles from Bombay. Population (1901), 16,300. Hard\u0101 is the tenth town in the Province in size. It is comparatively modern, Handi\u0101, an old Muhammadan town, 12 miles distant, having formerly been the principal place in this part of the valley. It was constituted a municipality in 1869. The municipal receipts during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 36,000. In 1903-4 they amounted to Rs. 66,000, of which Rs. 50,000 was derived from octroi. The town is supplied with water from the Anjan river, a mile and a half distant, but the works are at present incomplete. Infiltration and pumping wells were sunk in the river in 1896; but owing to the famine in that year, the Government loan which the municipality required for their completion could not be allotted. In 1900, when there was a scarcity of water, a small pump was set up in the infiltration well, and water was conveyed to some stand-pipes in the southern end of the town, and subsequently to the bathing gh\u0101t. The total expenditure on the works has been Rs. 52,000. Hard\u0101 is an important commercial centre for the export of grain. Four cotton-ginning factories, three of which also contain presses, have been opened since 1899. Their combined capital is 3\u00b715 lakhs, and in 1904 they cleaned and pressed cotton to the value of Rs. 56,000. The town also contains railway workshops. Local handi-\ncrafts include the manufacture of brass vessels and of thick cloths for the tops of carts, and the preparation and stuffing of skins. There is a printing press with English and Hindi type. A subdivisional officer for the two tahsils of Hard\u0101 and Seon\u012b-M\u0101lw\u0101 is stationed here. The Foreign Christian Missionary Society supports, with the assistance of Government grants, a high school with 21 pupils, and an English middle school. There are three dispensaries, two of which are maintained by the railway company and the mission.\n\n**Hardoi District.**\u2014Western District of the Lucknow Division, United Provinces, lying between 26\u00b0 53' and 27\u00b0 47' N. and 79\u00b0 41' and 80\u00b0 49' E., with an area of 2,331 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Sh\u0101hjah\u0101npur and Kheri; on the east by the Gunti river, which separates it from Sit\u0101pur; on the south by Lucknow and Unao; and on the west by Cawnpore and Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d, the Ganges forming part of the boundary. Hardoi is a level plain, with unimportant elevations and depressions. Along the Ganges in the south-west is found a strip of damp alluvial ground, while the rest of the District lies in the uplands, which contain sandy hillocks and ridges both on the east and west, and sink a little towards the centre. The chief tributary of the Ganges is the R\u0101mgang\u0101, a large river with a very variable channel, which traverses the west of the District and is joined near its confluence with the Ganges by the Garr\u0101. Through the central depression flows the Sai, while the Gunti forms the eastern boundary, its banks being marked by rolling hills and undulating plains of sandy composition, and by small ravines. In the central depression are found many jhil or swamps, the largest of which is the D\u0101har Lake near S\u0101nd\u012b; and the same tract contains broad stretches of barren \u012bsar land.\n\nThe District exposes nothing but alluvium, in which kankar or calcareous limestone is found. The \u012bsar or barren land is often covered with saline efflorescences.\n\nHardoi still contains a large area of jungle and uncultivated land; but the former is chiefly composed of dh\u0101k (Butea frondosa), and the only vegetation on the sandhills is a tall grass, whose large waving white plumes form a graceful feature in the landscape. Fig-trees, especially the banyan, and bamboos are numerous; but groves of mangoes are not so common as in the neighbouring Districts, though their area is increasing.\n\nWolves are found near the Gunti, and nilgai haunt a few jungles. The antelope is still common in most parts. Jackals and hares are very abundant. The District is rich in wild-fowl, and fish are caught in all the larger rivers and tanks.\n\nThe District is generally healthy, and its climate is cooler and drier than the greater part of the rest of Oudh. The average mean monthly\ntemperature ranges from about $50^\\circ$ in January to $95^\\circ$ in June, while the maximum seldom rises above $105^\\circ$ in the shade.\n\nRain is equally distributed in all parts, the average annual fall being about 32 inches. Large variations from year to year are, however, common. Thus, in 1867 the rainfall amounted to 67 inches, and in 1896 to only 17 inches.\n\nThe early traditions of this District are connected both with the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and the R\u0101m\u0101yana. During the Buddhist and early Hindu period its history is a blank. According to popular legend, the R\u0101jputs and early Muhammadan settlers found the District inhabited by Thather\u0101s. It is, however, probable that these were not the brass and copper workers who are now called by this name, but that the word has been altered by a false etymology. A general in the army of Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni is said to have raided the District in 1019, after the fall of Kanauj, and many traditions are current about the passage of Saiyid S\u0101l\u0101r a few years later. Muhammadan rule did not, however, commence till the reign of Altamsh, when the whole District was acquired. In the fifteenth century Hardoi passed under the new kingdom of Jaunpur; and owing to its situation near the fords leading to the great city of Kanauj it formed the scene of many sanguinary battles during the next 150 years. It was here that the Sharki kings of Jaunpur mustered their forces and bade defiance to the Lod\u012b sovereigns of Delhi. After their defeat at P\u0101nipat in 1526 the Afghan nobles still held Kanauj and the country north-east of the Ganges. B\u0101bar and his son and successor, Hum\u0101y\u016bn, drove out the Afgh\u0101ns for a time; but when Hum\u0101y\u016bn had suffered defeat at Chaus\u0101 in 1539, his own brother turned against him and seized Bilgr\u0101m. In the following year Sher Sh\u0101h marched through the District and encamped opposite Kanauj, which was occupied by Hum\u0101y\u016bn. The emperor crossed the river, but his defeat entailed the downfall of Mughal rule for the time. The Afgh\u0101ns were finally subdued early in the reign of Akbar, who included the District in the sark\u0101rs of Khair\u0101b\u0101d and Lucknow, and little is known of it till the break-up of the Mughal empire. Hardoi formed part of the territory of the Naw\u0101bs of Oudh, and from its position was the border-land between Shuj\u0101-ud-daula and the Rohillas. From 1773 a brigade of British troops was stationed close to Bilgr\u0101m for a few years, till its transfer to Cawnpore. In later times Hardoi was one of the most lawless tracts in the whole of Oudh, and Sleeman described the talukd\u0101rs in 1849 as openly defiant of the king's officers. At annexation in 1856 a District was formed with head-quarters at Mall\u0101nw\u0101n.\n\nA year later the Mutiny broke out and the country was plunged into anarchy. A column of 400 sepoys, who had been dispatched\nfrom Lucknow, broke into rebellion early in June, when the Ganges was reached. The troops at Mall\u0101nw\u0101n also mutinied and seized the treasury, but the District officials escaped to Lucknow. All the taluk-d\u0101rs, with the exception of the R\u0101j\u0101 of Katiy\u0101ri, and the people generally joined in the rebellion and sent levies to Lucknow. In April, 1858, after the fall of the capital, General Walpole marched through, fighting two engagements; but it was not till near the close of the year that the rebels were finally reduced. The head-quarters of the District were then moved to Hardoi.\n\nMany ancient mounds, which are locally ascribed to the Thather\u0101s, may contain relics of Buddhist and early Hindu periods, but they still await exploration. The chief Muhammadan remains are at Bilgr\u0101m, Mall\u0101nw\u0101n, Pih\u0101n\u012b, and Sand\u012bl\u0101.\n\nThe District contains 10 towns and 1,888 villages. Population increased between 1869 and 1891, but decreased slightly in the next decade. At the four enumerations the numbers were:\n\n- (1869) 931,377,\n- (1881) 987,630,\n- (1891) 1,113,211,\n- and (1901) 1,092,834.\n\nThere are four tahsils\u2014Hardoi, Sh\u0101h\u0101bad, Bilgr\u0101m, and Sand\u012bl\u0101\u2014each named from its head-quarters. The principal towns are the municipalities of Sh\u0101h\u0101bad, Sand\u012bl\u0101, and Hardoi, the District head-quarters, and the 'notified areas' of Sand\u012bl\u0101 and Pih\u0101n\u012b. The following table gives the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil     | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|------------|----------------------|----------------|----------|------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Hardoi     | 635                  | 2              | 470      | 282,158    | 444                         | - 7.5                                                          | 5,115                                  |\n| Sh\u0101h\u0101bad   | 542                  | 3              | 518      | 250,533    | 462                         | + 1.0                                                          | 4,729                                  |\n| Bilgr\u0101m    | 596                  | 4              | 485      | 293,948    | 493                         | + 4.3                                                          | 5,302                                  |\n| Sand\u012bl\u0101    | 558                  | 1              | 415      | 266,195    | 477                         | - 4.0                                                          | 4,835                                  |\n\nDistrict total: 2,331 10 1,888 1,092,834 469 - 1.8 19,981\n\nAbout 89 per cent. of the population are Hindus and nearly 11 per cent. Musalm\u0101ns. The density of population is low for Oudh. Between 1891 and 1901 large areas in Hardoi suffered from floods and later from drought. Western Hindi is spoken by the entire population, the Kanauji dialect being the commonest.\n\nThe most numerous Hindu castes are Cham\u0101rs (tanners and cultivators), 171,000; Br\u0101hmans, 115,000; P\u0101s\u012bs (toddy-drawers and cultivators), 89,000; Ahirs (graziers and cultivators), 80,000; Th\u0101kurs or R\u0101jp\u016bts, 78,000; K\u0101chhis (market-gardeners), 45,000; and Gada-r\u012bs (shepherds), 41,000. The Arakhs, who are akin to the P\u0101s\u012bs,\nand number 24,000, are not found elsewhere in such large numbers. Among Muhammadans are Path\u00e3ns, 19,000; Shaikhs, 15,000; and Jul\u00e3h\u00e3s (weavers), 13,000. Agriculture supports 74 per cent. of the total population, and general labour nearly 6 per cent. R\u00e3jputs hold nearly two-thirds of the land.\n\nIn 1901 there were 485 native Christians, of whom 437 were Methodists. The American Methodist Mission commenced work in 1869 and has six churches, thirty-three day-schools, a training school, and an orphanage.\n\nHardoi is liable to considerable fluctuations in prosperity, owing to poverty of soil in some parts, liability to floods in others, and a deficiency of irrigation. A tract of high sandy Agriculture. bh\u00fbr lies along the eastern border near the Gumti, in which cultivation is much scattered and the best crops can be grown only near village sites. The central tract is more fertile, but even this is interrupted by barren stretches of usar and by swamps, while bh\u00fbr reappears along the Sai. West of the central area of loam and clay rises a considerable ridge of sandy soil, which broadens out into a wide tract near the north. Throughout the District the bh\u00fbr is precarious, as it suffers both from drought and from floods, and to produce good crops requires a particular distribution of the rainfall. The inferior character of much of the soil is clearly shown by the large area producing barley, bajra, and gram. In the Ganges valley, and to a smaller extent in the valleys of the other rivers, an area of rich alluvial soil is found, which is, however, liable to floods.\n\nThe tenures of Hardoi are those common to Oudh. Talukd\u00e3rs own about 24 per cent. of the total area, about 5 per cent. being sub-settled. More than half is held on pattid\u00e3ri tenure. The main agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are shown below, in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Hardoi | 635   | 432        | 143       | 110              |\n| Shahabad* | 542   | 395        | 99        | 106              |\n| Bilgram | 596   | 492        | 92        | 81               |\n| Sandila | 558   | 338        | 116       | 86               |\n| **Total** | **2,331** | **1,537** | **420** | **383** |\n\n* Figures for 1901-2.\n\nWheat is the crop most largely grown, covering 470 square miles or 31 per cent. of the total area. The remaining food-crops of importance are: barley (273), bajra (230), gram (195), arhar (153), and pulses (114); while jow\u00e3r, rice, and maize are grown to a smaller extent. Poppy is the chief non-food crop (32 square miles). Sugar-cane and cotton are not much cultivated.\nThe area under the plough is increasing, but is liable to great fluctuations owing to vicissitudes of season. It amounted to 1,320 square miles in 1864, and rose to an average of 1,448 square miles during the good years 1886\u201390, but fell to 1,415 in 1894. By 1903\u20134 it had risen to 1,537 square miles. An enormous increase has taken place in the area bearing two crops in a year, which also varies considerably. The increase is attended by a distinct improvement in the staples, especially since the famine of 1896\u20137. Thus the area under wheat, maize, sugar-cane, poppy, and garden produce is gaining at the expense of inferior crops. A special officer of the Irrigation department has recently been posted to Hardoi, to inquire into the possibility of improving the drainage of the District. Large advances have been made under the Land Improvement and Agriculturists\u2019 Loans Acts, amounting during the ten years ending 1901 to a total of 5.5 lakhs, of which 2.3 lakhs was lent in the famine year, 1896\u20137. In the next four years the loans averaged only Rs. 2,400. A few small co-operative credit societies have been opened and two or three are flourishing.\n\nThe cattle are rather better than those of southern Oudh, but the area available for grazing is decreasing. The B\u0101ngar breed has some reputation for hardiness and activity. Ponies are unusually plentiful, but are of a poor stamp and are chiefly used as pack-animals. A stallion has been kept in the District since 1893, and another was tried for some years, but horse-breeding has not become popular. Sheep and goats are very largely reared, the former for wool and the latter for their flesh, milk, and manure.\n\nOnly 420 square miles were irrigated in 1903\u20134. Wells supplied 203 square miles, tanks or jhils 191, and other sources 26. The sandy bh\u016br is not suitable for the construction of wells, but they can be made elsewhere, and large numbers of temporary wells are dug annually. During the recent famine about 20,000 such wells were made in a few weeks with the help of loans advanced by Government. Water is usually raised from wells in a leathern bucket by bullocks, but the buckets are also worked by relays of men. Where the water is near the surface the dhenkli or lever is used, and irrigation from tanks or jhils is effected by the swing-basket. The small streams are used for irrigation to a larger extent than elsewhere in Oudh, but the Sai is the only considerable river from which a supply is obtained. A scheme has frequently been discussed to construct a canal from the S\u0101rd\u0101, but the project has been abandoned. Part of the cutting made by the kings of Oudh early in the nineteenth century to connect the Ganges and Gumti is still visible in the south-west of the District, but has never been used for irrigation.\n\nKankar or nodular limestone is found in most parts of the District, and is used for metalling roads and for making lime. Saltpetre is\nextracted from saline efflorescences at several places, the largest factories being at Hardoi town.\n\nThe manufactures are not important. Cotton cloth is woven in a few towns and villages, but there is little demand for the finer products of the loom, which once had some reputation. The curtains and tablecloths made at Sandila are, however, of artistic merit. Blankets, sacking, rope, string, and nets are also turned out. Vessels of brass and bell-metal are made at Mallanwan, and silver rings at Gopamau. Carpentry is of some importance at Hardoi town, and a little wood-carving is produced in several places.\n\nThe District exports grain, raw sugar, tobacco, hides, cattle, and saltpetre, and imports piece-goods, metals, salt, cotton, and refined sugar. Grain is exported to Calcutta and Bombay, and sugar to Central India. A good deal of sugar and even sugar-cane is sent from the north of the District to the Rosa factory near Shahjahanpur. Hardoi town is the chief mart, while Sandila, Madhoganj, and Sandi are increasing in importance. Several of the old trade centres have suffered from the changes made in trade routes by the alignment of the railway.\n\nThe main line of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway traverses the District from south-east to north-west. A branch from Balamau leads to Rudamau and Madhoganj, and the construction of other branches is contemplated. The improvement of roads was long delayed in Hardoi; but the District now contains 634 miles of road, of which 92 are metalled. The latter are maintained by the Public Works department, but the cost of all but 4 miles is charged to Local funds. Avenues of trees are maintained on 179 miles. The chief metalled roads are feeders to the railway. Shahabad, Sandi, and Mallanwan lie on the old road from Delhi to Benares north of the Ganges.\n\nFrom the physical characteristics of its soil, the District is liable to suffer considerably from irregularities in the rainfall. Between 1868 and 1874 alternate floods and droughts had so affected the agricultural prosperity that the settlement was revised. The failure of the rains in 1877 caused general distress, especially among the labouring classes, and small relief works were opened in January, 1878. In 1893 and 1894 much damage was done by excessive rain, which threw large areas out of cultivation. The following year was marked by an uneven and scanty distribution of the monsoon, and there was acute distress as early as November, 1895. Test works were opened early in 1896, and famine conditions were established by June. The rains failed, and the District experienced the worst famine recorded. By May, 1897, more than 113,000 persons were employed on relief works. The revenue demand was suspended to the extent of 8.7 lakhs, and 5.8 lakhs was subsequently remitted.\nSince the famine the District has recovered rapidly, and in 1901 it was noted that unskilled labour was difficult to obtain.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner is usually assisted by a member of the Indian Civil Service (when available), and by four Deputy-Collectors recruited in India. Two officers of the Opium department are stationed in the District, and a tahsildar is in charge of each tahsil.\n\nCivil work is disposed of by two Munsifs and a Subordinate Judge subordinate to the Judge of Hardoi, who is also Civil and Sessions Judge for Unao. Hardoi is not remarkable for any particular form of crime, though murders were formerly frequent. Dacoity of a professional type is prevalent at intervals. Wandering tribes, especially H\u0101b\u016br\u0101s, are responsible for many offences against property; and the District is the home of about 100 families of Barw\u0101rs, who commit their depredations at a distance.\n\nUnder the Naw\u0101b's government the revenue demand of the District was 14.6 lakhs, and this was taken as the basis of the summary settlement made at annexation in 1856. After the Mutiny a second summary settlement was made, the demand amounting to 10.2 lakhs with cesses. A survey and regular settlement followed between 1860 and 1871, which involved the determination of a vast number of suits for rights in land. The assessment was based partly on estimates of the agricultural produce, and partly on assumed rent-rates derived from personal inquiries. The revenue so fixed amounted to 14.3 lakhs; but before the settlement had been confirmed a series of bad years occurred, and a revision took place in 1874 by which the demand was reduced to 13.3 lakhs. The next settlement was made between 1892 and 1896, and was primarily based on the recorded rents. The proposed demand was 16.1 lakhs; but owing to the succession of bad seasons during and after the assessment it was decided to make a complete revision, which accordingly took place between 1900 and 1902, and the demand was reduced by Rs. 48,000. The revenue in 1903-4 amounted to 15.8 lakhs, with an incidence of R. 1 per acre, varying from R. 0.7 to Rs. 1.5 in different parganas.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and revenue from all sources have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 13.29  | 13.49  | 14.83  | 15.81  |\n| Total revenue  | 16.37  | 18.03  | 20.30  | 22.63  |\n\nThree towns are administered as municipalities and two as 'notified areas,' while four more are under the provisions of Act XX of 1856.\nLocal affairs beyond the limits of these are managed by the District board, which in 1903-4 had an income of Rs. 90,000, chiefly derived from rates. The expenditure in the same year amounted to 1.2 lakhs, including Rs. 56,000 spent on roads and buildings.\n\nThe District Superintendent of police has under him a force of 3 inspectors, 95 subordinate officers, and 336 constables, distributed in 13 police stations; and there are also 183 municipal and town police, and 2,370 rural police. The District jail contained a daily average of 321 prisoners in 1903.\n\nFew Districts in the United Provinces are so backward as Hardoi in regard to education. In 1901 only 1.8 per cent. of the population (3.3 males and 0.1 females) could read and write. The number of public schools fell from 153 in 1880-1 to 138 in 1900-1, but the number of pupils increased from 5,108 to 5,886. In 1903-4 there were 160 such schools with 7,376 pupils, of whom 253 were girls, besides 106 private schools with 1,551 pupils. Only 1,879 of the total number of scholars were above the primary stage. Four schools were under the management of Government and 159 under the District or municipal boards. Out of a total expenditure on education of Rs. 45,000, Local funds provided Rs. 36,000, and fees Rs. 7,000.\n\nThere are 7 hospitals and dispensaries, with accommodation for 84 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 52,000, including 853 in-patients, and 2,297 operations were performed. The expenditure amounted to Rs. 10,000, chiefly met from Local funds.\n\nAbout 51,000 persons were successfully vaccinated in 1903-4, representing the high proportion of 46 per 1,000 of population. Vaccination is compulsory only in the municipalities.\n\n[H. R. Nevill, *District Gazetteer*, 1904.]\n\n**Hardoi Tahsil.**\u2014Head-quarters tahsil of Hardoi District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Bangar, Gop\u0101mau, Sarah (South), B\u0101wan, and Barwan, and lying between 27\u00b0 9' and 27\u00b0 39' N. and 79\u00b0 50' and 80\u00b0 28' E., with an area of 635 square miles. Population fell from 306,071 in 1891 to 282,158 in 1901, the rate of decrease being the highest in the District. There are 470 villages and two towns: Hardoi (population, 12,174), the District and tahsil headquarters, and Gop\u0101mau (5,656). The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 3,99,000, and for cesses Rs. 68,000. The density of population, 444 persons per square mile, is below the District average. The tahsil is bounded on the east by the Gumt\u012b. It is also crossed by the Sai, and the western portion extends beyond the Garr\u0101. It therefore includes a great variety of soils, ranging from the sandy bh\u016br near the Gumt\u012b across the central uplands to the alluvial soil near the R\u0101mgang\u0101. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 432 square\nmiles, of which 143 were irrigated. Wells supply two-thirds of the irrigated area, and tanks or jhils most of the remainder.\n\n**Hardoi Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the District of the same name, United Provinces, situated in $27^\\circ 23' N.$ and $80^\\circ 7' E.$, on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. Population (1901), 12,174. The native town consists of two parts: Old Hardoi, a village standing on an ancient mound; and the new town which has sprung up since the head-quarters of the District were moved here after the Mutiny. The public buildings include, besides the usual courts, male and female dispensaries, and a fine hall containing the municipal and District board offices, a public library, and a club. The American Methodist Mission has its head-quarters here and supports an orphanage. Hardoi has been a municipality since 1871. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 14,500. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 20,000, chiefly from a tax on professions and trades (Rs. 7,000) and from rents and market dues (Rs. 7,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 24,000. Hardoi is the centre of an export trade in grain, and is also celebrated for woodwork. Two large saltpetre factories have an annual output valued at about half a lakh. There are four schools for boys and two for girls, with a total of 450 pupils.\n\n**Hardu\u0101ganj.**\u2014Town in the District and tahsil of Aligarh, United Provinces, situated in $27^\\circ 56' N.$ and $78^\\circ 12' E.$, 6 miles east of Aligarh town. Population (1901), 6,619. Tradition assigns the foundation to Har Deva and Balar\u0101ma, brothers of Krishna; but no ancient remains have been found. The Chauh\u0101n R\u0101jputs say they settled here when Delhi was taken by the Musalm\u0101ns. In the eighteenth century S\u0101bit Kh\u0101n improved the town considerably. There is a good bazar, lined with brick-built shops; and the town contains a police station, post office, and school. It was formerly a municipality, but is now administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of Rs. 1,450. The chief imports are salt, timber, and bamboos, and the chief exports cotton and grain. A cotton-gin has been set up which employed 106 hands in 1903. The primary school has 90 pupils, and there are two girls\u2019 schools with 29 pupils.\n\n**Hardw\u0101r.**\u2014Ancient town and place of pilgrimage in Sah\u0101ranpur District, United Provinces, situated in $29^\\circ 58' N.$ and $78^\\circ 10' E.$ Till 1900 it was the terminus of a branch of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway opened in 1886, but it is now connected by rail also with Dehra. The pilgrim route to the shrines of Kumaun passes through it. The population fluctuates considerably according to the number of pilgrims visiting it, and has been: (1872) 21,555, (1881) 28,106, (1891) 29,125, and (1901) 25,597. Of the total population in 1901, Hindus numbered 18,209 and Musalm\u0101ns 7,119.\n\nThe place has borne several names. According to tradition it was\nnamed K\u0101pil\u0101 after the sage of that name, who is said to have lived here. In the seventh century Hiuen Tsiang described a town named Mo-yu-lo, which was probably May\u016bra or M\u0101y\u0101pur, a suburb south of Hardw\u0101r. The Chinese pilgrim also mentions that there was a Br\u0101hma\u1e47ical temple north of Mo-yu-lo which the Hindus called \u2018the gate of the Ganges,\u2019 and this name Gang\u0101dw\u0101ra is regularly used by the Muhammadan historians for Hardw\u0101r. The meaning of the present name is disputed. Worshippers of Siva derive it from Hara, a name of Siva, while the Vaishnavas claim that the correct origin is from Har\u012b, a name of Vishnu. Abul Fazl, in the reign of Akbar, refers to M\u0101y\u0101, known as Haridw\u0101ra, and Tom Coryat, who visited the place in Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s reign, called it \u2018Hari-dw\u0101ra, the capital of Siva.\u2019\n\nThe town is beautifully situated on the right bank of the Ganges, at the foot of the Siw\u0101liks, close by the gorge through which the river debouches on the plains. On the opposite shore rises the hill of Chand\u012b Pah\u0101r, whose summit is crowned by a temple. The Ganges here divides into many shallow channels, with wooded islands between. One channel commences about 2 miles above Hardw\u0101r, and flows past the main town and its suburbs, M\u0101y\u0101pur and Kankhal, rejoining the parent river a little below the last-mentioned place. The head-works of the Upper Ganges Canal are situated on this branch, between M\u0101y\u0101pur and Kankhal. The town has grown considerably since the early part of the nineteenth century. At the present day the great object of attraction is the bathing gh\u0101\u1e6d, called Har\u012b-k\u0101-charan or Har\u012b-ki-pair\u012b (\u2018Vishnu\u2019s footprint\u2019), with the adjoining temple of Gang\u0101dw\u0101ra. A stone on the wall of the gh\u0101\u1e6d bears the footprint, which is an object of special reverence. Pilgrims struggle to be the first to plunge into the pool on great occasions, and stringent police regulations are required to prevent the crowd from trampling one another to death. In 1819, 430 persons, including some sepoys on guard, lost their lives in this manner, and the gh\u0101\u1e6d was enlarged. The great assemblage of pilgrims is held annually on the first day of the month of Bais\u0101kh, the commencement of the Hindu solar year, when the sun enters Aries. Every twelfth year the planet Jupiter is in the sign Aquarius (Kumbh) at this time, and the occasion is considered one of special sanctity, the fair being called the Kumbh mel\u0101. In 1796 the attendance was estimated at $2\\frac{1}{2}$ millions, and in 1808 at 2 millions. These were probably exaggerations, as the number at ordinary fairs was later found to be only about 100,000, and at the Kumbh mel\u0101 about 300,000. In 1892 the fair was broken up on account of an outbreak of cholera, and the vast concourse of people sent off by rail before the great bathing day. The result of this action was the formation of the Hardw\u0101r Improvement Society, supported by contributions from Hindus all over India, which has introduced various sanitary reforms. The bottom\nof the pool has been paved, and the current of the Ganges directed so as to secure a constant strong flow of water, while an iron railing has been erected to prevent bathers from being carried away. Another sacred pool, called Bhimgoda, has been enlarged and paved, and water is now supplied from the Ganges. The society also furnished part of the funds required to bridge a torrent-bed lying between the station and the town. Plague broke out in 1897, but was quickly suppressed. A few more cases took place in 1898, and the measures adopted to prevent the spread led to a riot. The numbers at the fair have decreased considerably since plague appeared. The total at any one time is also affected by the fact that pilgrims now visit Hardwar throughout the year, instead of only on the fixed days. On the great bathing day at the Kumbh mel\u0101 of 1903 about 400,000 persons were present. Cholera, however, broke out; and although the cases at Hardwar were few, the disease was carried by the pilgrims into the hill tracts leading to the Himalayan shrines. In early days riots and bloody fights were of common occurrence amid the excited throng. In 1760, on the great bathing day, the rival mobs of gosains and bairagis had a long battle, in which 1,800 are said to have perished. In 1795 the Sikh pilgrims slew 500 of the gosains. Timur plundered and massacred a great concourse of pilgrims here shortly after seizing Delhi in 1398. In 1894 it was anticipated that the flood caused by the Gohna Lake would damage the town and head-works of the canal; but the river rose only 12 feet, and the damage was not excessive. The trade of the town is confined to supplying the wants of the pilgrims and to the through traffic with Dehra. Branches of the American Methodist Mission are maintained at Jw\u0101l\u0101pur and Kankhal. The Hardwar Union municipality was constituted in 1868, and includes the two villages of M\u0101y\u0101pur and Kankhal. The income and expenditure from 1892 to 1901 averaged about Rs. 43,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 91,000, of which Rs. 31,000 was derived from octroi, Rs. 20,000 from a loan, and Rs. 33,000 from the pilgrim tax. The expenditure was 1\u00b72 lakhs; chiefly on the fair, Rs. 84,000.\n\nHareshwar.\u2014Village in Janjira State, Bombay. See Devgarh.\n\nHari\u0101na.\u2014A tract of country in the Punjab, lying between 28\u00b0 30' and 30\u00b0 N. and 75\u00b0 45' and 76\u00b0 30' E., chiefly in the eastern half of Hissar District, but also comprising part of Rohtak District and of the States of Jind and Patiala. It is in shape an irregular oval, with its long axis lying north-west and south-east. On the north-west it is bounded by the Ghaggar valley; on the west, south-west, and south by the Bagar and Dhundauti, or sandy tracts which are the continuation of the Bikaner desert; on the east by the Jumna riverain; and on the north-east by the Nardak country, from which it is divided by a line roughly coinciding with the alignment of the Southern Punjab Railway. The\nname of Hari\u0101na is most probably derived from hari ('green'), and is reminiscent of a time when this was a rich and fertile tract. Archaeological remains show that the country watered by the Saraswati was once the scene of a flourishing Hindu civilization; and the records of Tim\u016br's invasion mention the sugar-cane jungles of Toh\u0101na, a proof that at any rate the valley of the Ghaggar was at that time of high fertility, though the country near Hiss\u0101r seems already to have been dry and arid. The chief events in the history of the tract will be found in the article on HISS\u0100R DISTRICT. At the end of the eighteenth century Hari\u0101na was a veritable no-man's-land, acknowledging no master and tempting none. Lying at the point where the three powers, Sikh, Bhatti, and Mar\u0101th\u0101, met, it covered an area of nearly 3,000 square miles of depopulated country. Its thousand towns and villages had once produced a revenue of 14 lakhs, but now yielded less than 3 lakhs. The tract thus lay open to attack; and in 1797\u20138 the adventurer George Thomas, who held the fief of Jhajjar from the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, took part of Kanharai and overran Hari\u0101na as far as the Ghaggar. At H\u0101nsi, which he found a desert, he established his capital, with a mint and arsenal. He next planned the conquest of the Punjab to the Indus, and actually advanced as far as the Sutlej. His successes appeared to have firmly established his power, and he built Georgegarh or Jah\u0101zgarh; but in 1801 he succumbed after a heroic struggle to the overwhelming power of Perron, De Boigne's successor in Sindhia's service. After the capture of H\u0101nsi by Bourquin, Hari\u0101na passed for a short time into the hands of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, and in 1803 came under British rule: a native governor was placed in charge of the Districts of Hari\u0101na and Rohtak, but British authority was not actually established till 1810.\n\nHari\u0101na Town.\u2014Town in the District and tahsil of Hoshi\u0101rpur, Punjab, situated in 31\u00b0 38' N. and 72\u00b0 52' E., 9 miles from Hoshi\u0101rpur. Population (1901), 6,005. From 1846 to 1860 it was the head-quarters of the tahsil. Its chief trade is in sugar. The municipality was created in 1867. The income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 3,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 3,200, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 3,100. It maintains a vernacular middle school, and the town has a dispensary.\n\nHarih\u0101r.\u2014Head-quarters of a sub-t\u0101luk in the D\u0101vangere t\u0101luk of Chitaldroog District, Mysore, situated in 14\u00b0 31' N. and 75\u00b0 48' E., on the Tungabhadra river and the Southern Mahratta Railway. Population (1901), 5,783. According to tradition, it was the stronghold of a giant named Guha or Guh\u0101sura, who by his austerities had won from Brahm\u0101 the boon of immunity from death at the hands of either Hari (Wishnu) or Hara (Siva). To relieve gods and men from his torment and break the spell, the two gods united into the one form Harihara and destroyed him. It was at an early period an agrah\u0101ra for Br\u0101hmans, favoured by\nthe Ch\u0101lukyas and other royal lines. In the twelfth century it was included in Nonambav\u0101di, governed by the P\u0101ndyans of Uchchangi. The fine temple of Hariharesvara was built in 1223 under the Hoysalas, by their general Pol\u0101lva. The Seunas afterwards held it, and their general S\u0101luva Tikkama added some buildings in 1277. Many benefactions were bestowed down to the sixteenth century by the Vijayanagar kings, one of the founders of which line assumed the name of Hariharar\u0101ya. After the fall of Vijayanagar the place was seized by the Tarikere chiefs, who erected the fort. From them it was taken by the Naw\u0101b of S\u0101van\u016br, who granted it in j\u0101g\u012br to Sher Kh\u0101n. While in possession of the Muhammadans the temple was left intact, but the roof was used for a mosque, a small Saracenic doorway being made in the tower for the pulpit. Harihar was afterwards sold to Bedn\u016br, and later held by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s till taken by Haidar Ali in 1763, since which time it has been thrice captured by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s. Until 1865 a Native regiment was stationed in the cantonment 2 miles north-west of Harihar. In 1868 was completed the fine bridge across the Tungabhadra for the trunk road towards Bombay. There is now also a separate bridge for the railway. The municipality dates from 1871. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 5,700 and Rs. 5,600. In 1903\u20134 they were Rs. 4,000.\n\nHaringh\u0101ta.\u2014Estuary of the Ganges. See Madhumat\u012b.\n\nHaripur Tahsil.\u2014Tahsil of Haz\u0101ra District, North-West Frontier Province, lying between 33\u00b0 44\u2032 and 34\u00b0 18\u2032 N. and 72\u00b0 33\u2032 and 73\u00b0 14\u2032 E., with an area of 657 square miles. It is bounded on the north-west by the Indus. The tahsil consists of a sloping plain, from 1,500 to 3,000 feet high, through which the Siran and Harroh flow. Low hills are dotted here and there over the plain. The population in 1901 was 151,638, compared with 142,856 in 1891. It contains the town of Haripur (population, 5,578), the head-quarters; and 311 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 1,72,000.\n\nHaripur Town (1).\u2014Head-quarters of the Haripur tahsil of Haz\u0101ra District, North-West Frontier Province, situated in 34\u00b0 N. and 72\u00b0 57\u2032 E., on the left bank of the Dor river, and on the road from Hassan Abd\u0101l to Abbott\u0101b\u0101d. Population (1901), 5,578. Haripur was founded about 1822 by Sard\u0101r Hari Singh, the Sikh governor of Haz\u0101ra, and on annexation became the head-quarters of the District, but was abandoned in favour of Abbott\u0101b\u0101d in 1853. An obelisk marks the grave of Colonel Canara, a European officer of the Sikh Artillery, who fell in 1848 defending his guns single-handed against the insurgents under Chattar Singh. The municipality was constituted in 1867. The income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 17,800. In 1903\u20134 the income and expenditure were Rs. 19,100.\nand Rs. 20,100 respectively. The town possesses a dispensary and a municipal middle school.\n\n**Haripur Town (2).** Old fort and village in the Dera Gopipur tahsil of Kangra District, Punjab, situated in 32\u00b0 N. and 76\u00b0 10' E., on the banks of the Banganga stream, 9 miles south-west of Kangra fort. Population (1901), 2,243. It was founded in the thirteenth century by Har Chand, the Katoch Rajah of Kangra, whose brother had succeeded to the throne of Kangra on the Rajah's supposed death. Har Chand had really fallen into a dry well while out hunting; and when he was extricated and heard of his brother's accession, he resigned his right and founded the town and fort of Haripur opposite Goler, making it the head-quarters of a separate principality. It continued to be the capital of the State until 1813, when it was treacherously seized by Ranjit Singh. A younger branch of the Goler family still lives in the town, but the elder branch resides in the neighbouring village of Nandpur, and Haripur is now of little importance.\n\n**Hari Rud.**\u2014One of the largest rivers in Afghanistan, with a total length of not less than 500 miles. It rises (34\u00b0 50' N., 66\u00b0 20' E.) at a point where the Koh-i-Baba range branches off into the Si\u0101h-B\u016bbak and Safed Koh ranges, which form its northern and southern watersheds. After a westerly course of about 280 miles past Herat and Ghori\u0101n, where it affords considerable irrigation, it turns northwards at Kuhsan to Sarakhs, and forms part of the western boundary of Afghanistan, finally losing itself in the Tejend oasis.\n\n**Harischandragarh.**\u2014Fort in the Akola taluka of Ahmadnagar District, Bombay, situated in 19\u00b0 23' N. and 73\u00b0 46' E., 19 miles south-west of Akola, and one of the most interesting points on the Western Ghats; 4,691 feet above sea-level. The fort and the temples on the summit are annually visited by numerous pilgrims on the occasion of the festival called Mah\u0101 Sivar\u0101tri. The ascent from the Poona side is very arduous. The visitors bathe in a masonry reservoir near the temples, apparently of Hem\u0101dpanti origin, and a fair is held in the vicinity. On a peak half a mile east of the summit is the citadel, with decaying walls and ruined cistern. There are five caves below the fort, apparently dating from the tenth or eleventh century. From the level plain on the top of the hill the cliff drops 2,000 feet sheer to the Konkan, to which access was formerly gained by rope and pulley. In the last Mar\u0101th\u0101 War Harischandragarh was taken in May, 1818, by Captain Sykes.\n\n**Harnai (1).**\u2014Railway station and village in Baluchist\u0101n, on the Sind-Pishin section of the North-Western Railway, situated in 30\u00b0 6' N. and 67\u00b0 56' E., at an elevation of 3,000 feet. It lies in the valley of the same name in the Sh\u0101hrig tahsil of the Sibi District, and is the starting-point of the road for Loralai (55\u00bd miles) and for Fort\nSandeman (168 miles), with which it is connected by a cart-road. Harnai contains a small bazar, police station, dispensary, and dak-bungalow.\n\n**Harnai (2).**\u2014Port in the D\u0101poli taluka of Ratn\u0101giri District, Bombay, situated in 17\u00b0 49' N. and 73\u00b0 6' E., 56 miles north-west of Ratn\u0101giri town. Population (1901), 6,245, including about 400 Christians. The port lies in a small rocky bay, and is a shelter for coasting craft in north-west winds. In 1818 Harnai was a station for British troops. The ordinary trade is small, but there is a brisk fish market from September to June. In 1903-4 the exports amounted to 2 lakhs and the imports to 5 lakhs. The island fortress of Suvarndrug, the 'golden fortress' or Janjira, is a little to the north of the port. This was built by the Bij\u0101pur Sult\u0101ns in the fifteenth century, and strengthened by Sivaji in 1660. In 1698 it was a station of K\u0101nhoji Angri\u0101's fleet, and in 1713 it was formally made over to him by R\u0101j\u0101 S\u0101hu. Under K\u0101nhoji's successor it became one of the chief centres of piracy on the coast. In 1755 Commodore James of the Bombay Marine co-operated with the Mar\u0101th\u0101 fleet in attacking the fortress. After pursuing Angri\u0101's fleet to southward, he returned to the vicinity of Suvarndrug, bombarded the garrison from the sea, and finally seized the fortress by a night attack\u00b9. It was then handed over to the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, and was finally taken by Colonel Kennedy, after a brief resistance, in 1818. Harnai promontory has a lighthouse, visible for 6 miles. The town contains one school, with 90 boys and 18 girls.\n\n**Harpanahalli Taluk.**\u2014South-western taluk of Bellary District, Madras, lying between 14\u00b0 30' and 15\u00b0 0' N. and 75\u00b0 42' and 76\u00b0 13' E., adjoining the Mysore plateau, with an area of 611 square miles. The population in 1901 was 95,646, compared with 82,241 in 1891. The taluk contains only one town, Harpanahalli (population, 9,320), the head-quarters; and 81 villages. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 1,63,000. At Chigateri gold is found in some of the streams. The cattle-fair at Kuruvatti is important. The taluk lies at a greater elevation than any other in the District. It is traversed by two small lines of hills, and is everywhere diversified by picturesque undulations with pleasant valleys among them. Its eastern half drains eastwards into the Chikka Hagari, and the remainder slopes southwards towards the Tungabhadra. In the Chikka Hagari basin patches of black cotton soil, aggregating about one-eighth of the area of the taluk, are to be found, but practically the whole of the rest is covered with mixed soils. Cholam and korra are, as usual throughout Bellary, the staple food-grains. Castor is exported in considerable quantities; and a characteristic crop is the yellow-\n\n\u00b9 This exploit is commemorated by a tower standing on Shooter's Hill in Kent, which was erected by James's widow, and is called Severndroog Castle.\nflowered niger-seed (*Guizotia abyssinica*), grown for the oil it produces, which flourishes amazingly on the most barren-looking soils. It is generally sown along with *ragi*. The only irrigation is that from tanks and wells, there being no river channel in the whole of the *t\u0101luk*.\n\n**Harpanahalli Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the *t\u0101luk* of the same name in Bellary District, Madras, situated in $14^\\circ 47'$ N. and $76^\\circ 0'$ E., in a hollow surrounded by low hills. Population (1901), 9,320. Between 1868 and 1882 it was the head-quarters of the Deputy-Collector who then held charge of the four western *t\u0101luks* of the District. It was formerly the seat of one of the most powerful of the local chieftains or *polig\u0101rs*, who kept all authority in their hands throughout the numerous changes of sovereigns which occurred in this part of the country. The remains of the fort are still standing, and, being surrounded by water on three sides, it must have been a strong place. The *polig\u0101rs* rose to power after the downfall of the Vijayanagar empire at the battle of T\u0101likot\u0101 in 1565, and by the end of the seventeenth century their possessions comprised 460 villages, for which they paid a tribute of over 8 lakhs. The chiefs were useful to Haidar \u0100l\u012b of Mysore, which still further strengthened their position, but his son Tip\u016b treacherously seized the *polig\u0101r* and imprisoned him and most of his relations. After the death of Tip\u016b at the storm of Seringapatam in 1799, the place was occupied by a former D\u012bw\u0101n of Harpanahalli on behalf of a child of the *polig\u0101r* family. But he yielded peacefully to General Harris when the latter marched through the country, and he and the *polig\u0101r* were rewarded with considerable estates. Both families are now extinct. The industries of the town include a little weaving of coarse cotton stuffs and woollen blankets, and some unambitious brass-work.\n\n**Harrand.**\u2014Village in the J\u0101mpur *tahsil* of Dera Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n District, Punjab, situated in $29^\\circ 33'$ N. and $70^\\circ 8'$ E., at the foot of the Sulaim\u0101n Hills. Population (1901), 715. Tradition connects the site with the Greek invasion, and derives the name from one Hari, a slave of Alexander. The existing remains are of Hindu origin, and date back to a time before the Muhammadan conquest. A considerable fort, built by the Sikhs in 1836, is now occupied by a detachment of frontier cavalry and infantry.\n\n**Hars\u016bd.**\u2014North-eastern *tahsil* of Nim\u0101r District, Central Provinces, lying between $21^\\circ 38'$ and $22^\\circ 25'$ N. and $76^\\circ 25'$ and $77^\\circ 13'$ E., with an area of 1,089 square miles. The population of the area now forming the *tahsil* was 54,998 in 1901, and 44,155 in 1891. The density is 51 persons per square mile, and there are 291 inhabited villages. The head-quarters, Hars\u016bd, is a village of only 1,098 inhabitants, 33 miles from Khandw\u0101 on the railway line towards It\u0101rs\u012b. Excluding 543 square miles of Government forest, 68 per cent. of the available area is occupied\nfor cultivation. The cultivated area in 1903\u20134 was 276 square miles. The demand for land revenue in the same year was Rs. 1,23,000, and for cesses Rs. 12,000. The tahsil was formed in 1896 by the transfer of the Ch\u0101rwa tract from Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d District and of some villages from the Khandw\u0101 tahsil, with the object of settling this large area of cultivable waste land on the ryotw\u0101ri system. About 160 ryotw\u0101ri villages have been established in the tahsil, which was enlarged in 1904 by the transfer of another tract from Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d. The land generally is broken and uneven, and covered over considerable areas with forest.\n\nH\u0101rua.\u2014Village in the Basirh\u0101t subdivision of the District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal, situated in 22\u00b0 37\u2032 N. and 88\u00b0 41\u2032 E. Population (1901), 705. It is the scene of a fair held every February in honour of P\u012br Gor\u0101 Ch\u0101nd, a Muhammadan saint, who lived 600 years ago and whose bones (h\u0101r) are buried here. The fair lasts for a week.\n\nHasanparti.\u2014Town in the District and taluk of Warangal, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in 18\u00b0 5\u2032 N. and 79\u00b0 31\u2032 E. Population (1901), 5,378. The special feature of the town is that it contains about a hundred houses of weavers, who are engaged in making silk s\u0101ris and other silk cloths, and also in manufacturing silk from tasar gathered by the Dandra tribe. It contains a State school where Urd\u016b and Telugu are taught, and also a police station. In the neighbourhood iron ore is found, from which iron and steel are manufactured in small quantities, and used by the ryots for implements of husbandry. A temple of Venkateshwar Sw\u0101mi is situated in the town, and a religious fair is held annually.\n\nHasanpur Tahsil.\u2014Western tahsil of Mor\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of the same name, lying along the Ganges between 28\u00b0 26\u2032 and 29\u00b0 4\u2032 N. and 78\u00b0 4\u2032 and 78\u00b0 26\u2032 E., with an area of 547 square miles. Population increased from 153,680 in 1891 to 161,020 in 1901. There are 530 villages and three towns, the largest of which are Hasanpur (population, 9,579), the tahsil head-quarters, and Bachhraon (7,452). The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,90,000, and for cesses Rs. 34,000. The density of population, 294 persons per square mile, is the lowest in the District. The east of the tahsil consists of a high sandy tract, which suffers from either excess or deficiency of rainfall. Between this and the Ganges lies a stretch of low kh\u0101dar land with bleak sandy wastes, reed jungle alternating with patches of rich cultivation. The Mah\u0101wa rises in the kh\u0101dar, while a long winding marsh marks its eastern boundary at the foot of the sandy ridge. In 1902\u20133 the area under cultivation was 315 square miles, of which only 16 were irrigated, chiefly from wells.\nHasanpur Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Mor\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d District, United Provinces, situated in $28^\\circ 44' N.$ and $78^\\circ 17' E.$, 33 miles west of Mor\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d city. Population (1901), 9,579. The town derives its name from Hasan Kh\u0101n, who founded it in 1634. It contains a dispensary and a branch of the American Methodist Mission. It is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 2,000. Its trade is purely local; but a small quantity of very good cloth is made. The middle school has 125 pupils.\n\nHasht-Bhaiya J\u0101girs.\u2014A collection of petty States in Central India, under the Bundelkhand Agency. These j\u0101girs were originally a part of Orchh\u0101 State. About 1690 Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Udot Singh of Orchh\u0101 gave his brother, Diw\u0101n Rai Singh, the j\u0101gir of Bar\u0101gaon (now in Jh\u0101nsi District). On his death the j\u0101gir was subdivided into eight (hasht) shares among his sons, thus forming the estates of Kari, Pasari, Tarauli, Chirgaon, Dhurwai, Bijna, Tori-Fatehpur, and Bank\u0101-Pah\u0101ri. The first three subsequently became merged in other holdings, while Chirgaon was confiscated in 1841 for the rebellion of the j\u0101gird\u0101r Bakht Singh, leaving four shares. The dismemberment of Orchh\u0101 by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s and the formation of the Jh\u0101nsi State led to constant disputes as to the suzerainty over these holdings. After the establishment of British supremacy, it was decided in 1821 that the j\u0101gird\u0101rs were directly dependent on the British Government, through whom the tribute levied by the Jh\u0101nsi State should be paid, but that the j\u0101gird\u0101rs should continue the usual observances to the Orchh\u0101 chief as the head of the family. These conditions were embodied in the sanads granted to the j\u0101gird\u0101rs in 1821 and 1823.\n\nHashtnagar ('Eight cities').\u2014Tract in the Ch\u0101rsadda tahsil of Pesh\u0101war District, North-West Frontier Province, comprising a strip of country that extends 10 miles eastward from the Sw\u0101t river, and stretches from the hills on the north to the K\u0101bul river on the south, between $34^\\circ 3'$ and $34^\\circ 25'$ N. and $71^\\circ 37'$ and $71^\\circ 57'$ E. It is said to derive its name from its eight chief villages, which probably occupy the site of the ancient Peukelaotis or Pushkalavati. General Cunningham, however, believed the modern term to be a corruption of Hastinagara, the city of Hasti, the Astes of Arrian. Raverty gave the old name as Ashnagar, but he does not explain its derivation. Before the Y\u016bsufzai Afgh\u0101ns settled in the Pesh\u0101war valley, Hashtnagar was held by the Shalm\u0101nis, a T\u0101jik race, subjects of the Sult\u0101n of Sw\u0101t, and the His\u0101r of Hashtnagar was the capital of a province which extended to the Kalp\u0101ni. After B\u0101bar's time it became the stronghold of a Muhammadzai chieftain. The inhabitants are Muhammadzai Path\u0101ns. The area is 303 square miles, and the tract is naturally divided into two sections: the sholg\u012bra, or lowlands, irrigated from the Sw\u0101t river; and the maira, or high plain, which is inter-\nsected by the Sw\u0101t River Canal. Near the head of the canal is Ab\u0101zai Fort.\n\nHassan District.\u2014District in the west of the State of Mysore, lying between $12^\\circ 31'$ and $13^\\circ 33'$ N. and $75^\\circ 23'$ and $76^\\circ 38'$ E., with an area of 2,647 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Kad\u016br District; on the east by Tumk\u016br and Mysore Districts; on the south by Coorg; and on the west by the South Kanara District of Madras.\n\nThe main body of the District consists of the Hem\u0101vati river basin. The only exceptions are the west of Manjar\u0101b\u0101d, which drains to the Netr\u0101vati in South Kanara; and the Arsikere t\u0101luk, whose waters run north to the Ved\u0101vati in Chitaldroog District. The Cauvery flows through a small portion of the south. The course of the Hem\u0101vati is first south in Manjar\u0101b\u0101d, then east from the Coorg border to beyond Hole-Narsipur, where it turns south and runs into the Cauvery in Mysore District. Its chief tributary is the Yagachi from the Bel\u016br t\u0101luk, which joins it near Gor\u016br in the Hassan t\u0101luk. The Manjar\u0101b\u0101d side of the District, resting on the brow of the Western Gh\u0101ts, forms part of the Male-s\u012bme or Maln\u0101d, the \u2018hill country,\u2019 the remainder being Maid\u0101n or Bayal-s\u012bme, the \u2018plain country,\u2019 also called M\u00fcdu-s\u012bme or \u2018east country.\u2019 The mountains forming the western limit extend from Jenkalbetta in the north to the Bisale gh\u0101\u1e6d in the south, including in the panorama the superb Jenkalbetta (4,558 feet), M\u016brkangudda (4,265 feet), Devarbett\u0101 (4,206 feet), and the towering height of Subrahmanya or Pushpagiri (5,626 feet). Low ranges of granitic hills run along the north, through the Bel\u016br, Hassan, and Arsikere t\u0101luk, marking the watershed which separates the Kistna and Cauvery river systems. Indrabetta (3,309 feet) at Sravana Belgola is noted for the colossal Jain statue on its summit. Some low hills pass through the Hole-Narsipur t\u0101luk towards Hassan and Channar\u0101yapatna. The Maln\u0101d or highland region occupies the whole of Manjar\u0101b\u0101d and the west of Bel\u016br. It has been thus graphically described:\n\n\u2018The country is generally undulating till on approaching the Gh\u0101ts, when it becomes precipitous. Perhaps there is no scenery in India more beautiful than the southern part of this tract, adjoining the north-west of Coorg. It for the most part resembles the richest park scenery in England. Hills covered with the finest grass or equally verdant crops of grain, adorned and crowned with clumps of noble forest trees, in some instances apparently planted most carefully, and certainly with perfect taste. The highest and the most beautiful knolls have been generally selected as the spots on which to build the small maths and other places of worship with which the country abounds; and the groves that surround or are in the vicinity of these are tended with the greatest care, and the trees composing them replaced as they\ndie off or are blown down. The southern differs from the more northerly and westerly parts in the absence of those dense jungles which obscure the view, and in the soft character of the hills, which are in most instances quite free from the stunted date, and smooth as the lawn of a villa on the Thames. But the whole taluk is beautiful, and less wooded than Coorg or Nagar, though greatly partaking of the features of both.\n\nThe Maidan or lowland tract, forming the largest and most populous portion of the District, consists of an undulating plain country, generally cultivated, but having extensive kavals or grazing lands. Patches covered with the wild date are common, and in some parts are limited tracts of stunted jungle growing upon a gravelly, gritty soil. The high-lying lands, particularly in the Hassan, Channarayapatna, and Hole-Narsipur taluks, have a singularly bare and bleak appearance, and are frequently so stony that they are unfit for cultivation. They form, however, good catchment basins for tanks, and the valleys below are rich and well wooded.\n\nThroughout the District, kaolin, felspar, quartz, and other materials suitable for the manufacture of earthenware are abundant. Kankar, a tufaceous nodular limestone, is found in many parts, and is the only form of limestone known. It occurs in alluvial valleys and on the banks of some streams, under or mixed with coloured clay. Potstone, from which the images at Halebid are carved, is found at places in the Hassan and Belur taluks. Hematite iron ore is obtained from the Bagadi hills in the Arsikere taluk, associated with granitic rocks, broken by trap protrusions. Gold-mining was commenced a few years ago at Harinalli and Kempinkote, but has been abandoned on account of the poor results obtained.\n\nThe vegetation found in this District is generally the same as in Kadur District and in Coorg. The portion occupying the Western Ghats (eastern face) possesses a splendid arborescent flora perhaps unrivalled in any other part of India.\n\nThe temperature of Hassan is slightly lower than that of Bangalore, the mean reading of the thermometer being 73\u00b0, and the daily range about 20\u00b0. The maximum has reached 98\u00b0 in April, while the minimum has touched 43\u00b0 in January. The heat during the months of March and April is much modified by the sea-breeze from the western coast, and by light fogs in the mornings and evenings. The temperature of the Malnad is some degrees lower, but this scarcely compensates for the malaria which is prevalent. European settlers generally suffer from fever after the early rains; but they soon grow acclimatized, and are ultimately better able to withstand it than the natives themselves, numbers of whom succumb each year to its attacks. The annual rainfall at Hassan averages 33 inches; but the country bordering on the Western Ghats\nhas a much heavier fall, the annual average at Sakleshpur being 84 inches, and at Aigur as high as 100. Even this is exceeded at some of the western coffee estates, the average at Byakarvalli estate being 110 inches, and at Hulhalli estate 120. During the south-west monsoon, May to August, the rainfall is continuous, with a few slight breaks. The sone or drizzling rain extends as far as Gr\u0101ma, 8 miles east of Hassan, and the condition of the surrounding vegetation distinctly shows the lines of demarcation which separate the Malnad from the Maidan country. The north-east monsoon also reaches the District, and the heavy rain in October is of great value in filling the tanks in the Maidan.\n\nThe earliest event supported by any evidence was a migration of Jains from Ujjain under the leadership of Bhadrab\u0101hu, in order to escape a dreadful famine of twelve years' duration which he had predicted. He was accompanied by Chandra Gupta, said to be the great Maurya emperor. While the emigrants were on their way to Punn\u0101ta (south Mysore), Bhadrab\u0101hu died at Sravana Belgola, attended in his last moments by Chandra Gupta, who remained there till his own death twelve years later. These occurrences are recorded in ancient rock inscriptions at Sravana Belgola. They invested the place with a sanctity which led to the well-known Jain settlement there. The country is said to have been prosperous and well populated, but to whom it belonged is not stated. The Kadambas, whose capital was at Banavasi, were ruling in the west of the District in the fourth and fifth centuries, and also again in some part of the eleventh. But the greater portion of the country was under the Gangas, whose inscriptions occur in all parts. Their general and minister, Ch\u0101munda R\u0101ya, erected the colossal Jain image of Gomata on the highest hill at Sravana Belgola about 983. The Cholas overthrew the Ganga power in 1004, and the Changalvas in the south-west and the Kongalvas in Arkalgud became subject to them. But the rise of the Hoysalas stopped their progress farther north. These sprang from a line of chiefs in the Western Ghats to the north of Manjarabad, and made Dorasamudra (now Halebid in the Belur taluk) their capital. Vishnuvardhana of this line, about 1116, drove the Cholas out of Mysore. Ballala II (1173-1209) carried the Hoysala dominions up to the river Kistna, making Lakkundi in Dh\u0101rwar his residence for some time. The king Somesvara (1233-54) extended the kingdom southwards over the Chola country, where he took up his abode at Kannanur near Trichinopoly. The Hoysala power was brought to an end in the fourteenth century by Muhammadan invasions from Delhi. But in 1336 was founded the Vijayanagar empire, under which the Manjarabad country and Belur were given to a line of chiefs who continued in power with intervals till the nineteenth century. Meanwhile most of the District had been conquered by the Mysore Rajas in the seventeenth century. The Channarayapatna fort was built in 1648 by\ntreaty with Bijapur, no doubt to mark the limits of the two territories. Sivappa Naik, the Keladi chief of Bednur, opposed the Mysore conquests, and not only held Manjarabad but bestowed Belur and other parts on the fugitive Vijayanagar king, who had taken refuge with him, even invading Seringapatam in 1646 on his behalf. Peace was eventually concluded between the two powers in 1694, by which six nads of Manjarabad were restored to the old chiefs, and the rest divided between the contending parties. When Haidar subdued Bednur in 1763, Manjarabad was allowed to remain in the hands of the chiefs on paying tribute. After the fall of Seringapatam it was absorbed into Mysore.\n\nWithin this District are included some of the most remarkable archaeological monuments in India. Of the colossal Jain image of Gomata at Sravana Belgola, Fergusson says\u2014'Nothing grander or more imposing exists anywhere out of Egypt.' It is a monolith, 57 feet high, in the human form, nude, with no support above the thighs, and stands on the summit of a granite hill 400 feet high. It was erected by Ch\u0101munda R\u0101ya, as inscribed at its foot in the Marathi, Kanarese, and Tamil languages, in N\u0101gari, Hala-Kannada, and Grantha and Vatteluttu characters respectively. Its date is about 983, and it belongs to the Ganga period. Among architectural monuments, the Chenna Kesava temple at Belur and the Hoysalesvara at Halebid take the first rank. They are in the Ch\u0101lukyan style, and were erected under the Hoysalas in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Fergusson praises the great temple at Halebid, as one of the buildings on which the advocate of Hindu architecture would desire to take his stand; and he says that the minute elaboration of the carving in both may probably be considered as one of the most marvellous exhibitions of human labour to be found even in the patient East. The artistic combination of horizontal with vertical lines, and the play of outline and of light and shade, far surpass anything in Gothic art. The effects are just what mediaeval architects were often aiming at, but which they never attained so perfectly as was done at Halebid. The ruined Kedaresvara at Halebid, which is now being restored, he pronounced to be one of the most exquisite specimens of Ch\u0101lukyan architecture in existence, and one of the most typical. There are also striking examples of the same style in ruined temples at Arsikere, H\u0101rnhalli, Koramangala, Hire-Kad\u016br, and other places in the District. The inscriptions of the District have been translated and published.\n\nThe population at each Census in the last thirty years was: (1871) 518,987, (1881) 428,344, (1891) 511,975, and (1901) 568,919. The decrease in 1881 was due to the famine of 1876\u20138.\n\nPopulation. By religion, in 1901 there were 541,531 Hindus, 16,668 Musalmans, 5,035 Animists, 3,795 Christians, 1,874 Jains, and 16 'others.' The density of population was 215 persons per square mile, that for the State being 185. The number of towns is 14, and of vil-\nlages 2,546. The head-quarters are at Hassan Town (population, 8,241).\n\nThe following table gives the principal statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Taluk          | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Total area covered |\n|----------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Hassan         | 475                  | 3               | 568      | 125,961    | 265                       | + 11.1                                                      | 6,018             |\n| Belur          | 339                  | 1               | 410      | 79,192     | 234                       | + 9.2                                                       | 3,535             |\n| Arsikere       | 486                  | 3               | 351      | 79,588     | 164                       | + 21.9                                                      | 3,394             |\n| Chammarayapatna| 415                  | 2               | 396      | 90,950     | 219                       | + 16.3                                                      | 2,715             |\n| Hole-Narsipur  | 233                  | 1               | 238      | 57,149     | 246                       | + 12.3                                                      | 1,645             |\n| Arkalgud       | 261                  | 3               | 303      | 76,775     | 294                       | + 11.3                                                      | 2,866             |\n| Manjarabad     | 438                  | 1               | 277      | 59,304     | 135                       | + 6.2                                                       | 3,233             |\n| District total | 2,647                | 14              | 2,546    | 568,919    | 215                       | + 11.1                                                      | 23,406            |\n\nThe Wokkaligas or cultivators number 173,000; the outcaste Holeyas and M\u00e4digas, 93,000 and 12,000; Ling\u0101yats, 83,000; Kurubas or shepherds, 45,000. Of Br\u0101hmans there are 19,000. The nomad Lamb\u0101nis are 3,000 strong, and Koramas half that number. Of Musalm\u0101ns the most numerous are Shaikhs, 11,000. By occupation, 81 per cent. are engaged in agriculture and pasture; 6 per cent. in the preparation and supply of material substances; 5.5 per cent. in unskilled labour not agricultural; and 2.5 per cent. in the State service.\n\nThe number of Christians is 3,795, of whom 3,554 are natives. At Gr\u0101ma there was a Roman Catholic chapel in the eighteenth century, which was protected by a Muhammadan officer and thus escaped destruction at the hands of Tip\u016b Sult\u0101n. Sathalli is the centre of an agricultural community established by the Abb\u00e9 Dubois early in the nineteenth century. The Wesleyan Mission has a station at Hassan town. Church of England chaplains at Bangalore visit Arsikere for the railway staff there.\n\nThe soil of the Malnad is a rich red sedimentary deposit, with forest loam in the jungles, and a red laterite soil on the grass-covered hills. The hills are of primitive formation, chiefly granitic, with a little iron ore. The products of this part are rice in the valleys, and coffee and cardamoms on the forest slopes. The soils in the plains surrounding the hills are generally of a rich sedimentary character, easily worked and yielding fine crops of cereals or garden produce. On the tops of the rising ground the soil is generally thinner and more sandy or gravelly than in the valleys, where it tends rather to be clayey and dark in colour. There are also other extensive tracts with a gravelly sandy soil, resulting\nfrom the disintegration in situ of the primitive schists superimposed upon the granite. Black soil occurs, but only to a small extent and in patches, chiefly in the Arkalg\u016bd, Channar\u0101yapatna, and Arsikere t\u0101luks.\n\nThe following table gives statistics of cultivation for 1903-4:\n\n| T\u0101luk          | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Forests | Cultivable waste |\n|----------------|-------|------------|-----------|---------|-----------------|\n| Hassan         | 439   | 171        | 41        | 31      | 22              |\n| Bel\u016br          | 296   | 121        | 39        | 1       | 22              |\n| Arsikere       | 481   | 165        | 8         | 100     | 54              |\n| Channar\u0101yapatna| 411   | 200        | 16        | 1       | 33              |\n| Hole-Narsipur  | 204   | 91         | 9         | 5       | 82              |\n| Arkalg\u016bd       | 231   | 120        | 13        | 26      | 6               |\n| Manjar\u0101b\u0101d     | 428   | 126        | 49        | 59      | 29              |\n| **Total**      | **2,490** | **989**    | **175**   | **223** | **248**         |\n\nThe grain principally cultivated in the Maln\u0101d is rice, which, though of an inferior quality, grows most luxuriantly in the long winding valleys and in fields cut in terraces on their sides, and is almost entirely dependent on the rainfall. The rice cultivated in the north-west of the Hassan t\u0101luk, and that grown in the Maid\u0101n t\u0101luks on land irrigated by channels from the rivers, is of a superior kind, and bears comparison with the best table rice of Southern India. In other places in the Maid\u0101n country the crop is dependent on irrigation from tanks. In a few places where irrigation is deficient, a coarse rice called bhar-dodd\u012b is raised, chiefly in the Arkalg\u016bd, Hole-Narsipur, and Channar\u0101yapatna t\u0101luks. The sugar-cane grown is generally of inferior kinds. The rise in the price of rice, combined with years of drought, has lessened the former popularity of coco-nut and areca-nut gardens. The most valuable of these are in the Arkalg\u016bd t\u0101luk, where many of the Br\u0101hman proprietors work in the gardens themselves. The areca-nut is known as the wol\u0101gra, and is not held in such high repute as that of Nagar. The coco-nuts of the Arsikere t\u0101luk, which are allowed to remain on the tree till they drop, are much prized, and are largely exported in a dry state to Tipt\u016br for the Bangalore and Bellary markets. Plantains of good quality are grown to a considerable extent, and formerly every ryot had a few trees at the back of his house; but the cultivation has gradually yielded to that of coffee, which ranks as one of the most important products of the country. The rich red loam of the pr\u012bmaevel forests which cover the slopes of the Maln\u0101d hills is found to be well adapted for its growth. The cultivation of the berry, introduced first from Mecca by B\u0101b\u0101 Budan on the hill which bears his name in Kad\u016br District, was gradually extended into Manjar\u0101b\u0101d, and when the British took over the administration of the country in\n1831 was beginning to attract some attention. It did not, however, become general till the first European plantation was opened in 1843. Since then others have taken up jungle lands and invested capital largely in the enterprise. Every native in the Malnad has a few coffee-trees planted at the back of his house, and the patels and principal gaudas have extended this cultivation till it embraces in small plots the whole of the jungles amid which their villages are situated. This industry, not long ago so flourishing, is at the present time in a most depressed condition, owing to the great fall in prices due to the competition of South America. The cardamom plant is indigenous, growing wild in the densely wooded ravines on the verge of the Western Ghats. Its systematic cultivation has for some years been undertaken on a large scale. Though the soil in many parts is favourable, little attention has been paid to the cultivation of wheat and cotton. The former is grown in the Arsikere taluk, and the latter in that and the Arkalgud taluk. Tobacco is grown to some extent on dry lands in parts of the Arsikere, Belur, and Arkalgud taluks. Arkalgud tobacco is much prized for snuff; but that of Harnhalli and Belur is of inferior quality, and chiefly sold on the west coast for chewing. Of the cultivated area in 1903-4, rice occupied 162 square miles, ragi 141, other food-grains 84, gram 101, coffee 69, oilseeds 54, garden produce 36, and sugar-cane 8.\n\nDuring the twelve years ending 1904 Rs. 58,000 was advanced as agricultural loans for land improvement, and Rs. 14,000 for irrigation wells.\n\nThe area irrigated from canals is 19 square miles, from tanks and wells 128, from other sources 28. The length of channels drawn from rivers is 153 miles, and the number of tanks 5,944, of which 231 are classed as 'major.'\n\nThe area of State forests is 184 square miles, of 'reserved' lands 37, and of plantations 2. The forest receipts in 1903-4 were Rs. 1,18,000, the chief item being sandal-wood.\n\nThe unsuccessful attempts at gold-mining at Harnhalli and Kempinkote have already been referred to. A certain quantity of soapstone is quarried for use in making images and large water-vessels. Laterite is very generally employed in the Malnad for building purposes. A little iron ore is smelted at Bagadi in the Arsikere taluk. It is used chiefly for agricultural implements.\n\nGood cotton cloth is manufactured at Hole-Narsipur. In other parts only the coarsest kinds are made. The Musalmans at Channarayapatna and Hole-Narsipur make small articles of silk, such as purses, cords, and tassels. The woollen blankets worn by the peasantry are made by the Kuruba or shepherd class in all taluks except Manjarabad. The\nmanufacture of brass and copper vessels is virtually a monopoly of the Jains at Sravana Belgola. Their pots are of excellent quality and meet with a ready sale at Mysore, and at the great annual festival at Subrahmanya in South Kanara. Oils (castor and gingelly) are mostly exported to Kanara, Coorg, and to Birur in Kadur District. Gunny-bags are made in the Arkalgud, Hole-Narsipur, and Channarayapatna taluks, and bags for the export of grain are also made from the bark of a tree called gaja mara or 'elephant-tree.' The trunk is steeped in water, after which the bark is removed entire by thrashing it, in which state it is not unlike the leg of an elephant. There are reported to be 1,617 looms for cotton, 646 for wool, 16 for other fibres, 299 oil-mills, and 291 mills for sugar and jaggery.\n\nThe trade of the country is chiefly in the hands of outsiders, who frequent the different markets. There are therefore few merchants resident in the District of any wealth or importance. In addition to coffee, the articles exported are chiefly food-grains. The imports consist of iron, European cottons and woollens, gh\u012b, areca-nuts and coco-nuts, and salt. The great rice market is at Alur in the Hassan taluk. It is attended by the ryots of the Malnad, who bring their rice in large quantities for sale, and by purchasers who come from great distances with carts and droves of bullocks for the conveyance of the rice purchased. Other important trading places are Yesalurpet, Kenchammana Hoskote, and Channarayapatna.\n\nThe Southern Mahratta Railway from Bangalore to Poona runs for 17 miles through the north-east of the District. The length of Provincial roads is 173 miles, and of District fund roads 444 miles.\n\nSince the general famine ending in 1878, the District, though sometimes affected by high prices of food-grains, has not been exposed to scarcity amounting to famine. The areca gardens suffered severely in the drought which prevailed in 1898.\n\nThe District is divided into seven taluks: Arkalgud, Arsikere, Belur, Channarayapatna, Hassan, Hole-Narsipur, and Manjarabad. The following subdivisions were placed in 1903 under Assistant Commissioners: Hassan and Arkalgud; Manjarabad and Belur, with head-quarters at Sakleshpur; Channarayapatna, Arsikere, and Hole-Narsipur, with head-quarters at Hassan town.\n\nThe District court at Mysore has jurisdiction over the whole of Hassan District, and the Subordinate Judge's court at Mysore over a part. There is a Subordinate Judge's court at Hassan for the remainder, and a Munsif's court at Hole-Narsipur. Owing to its position on the border of other jurisdictions, serious crime, such as dacoity, is not uncommon.\nThe land revenue and total revenue are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|        | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue | 9.60   | 10.58  | 12.07  | 11.56  |\n| Total revenue | 11.25  | 14.54  | 17.25  | 16.99  |\n\nThe revenue survey and settlement were introduced in the north between 1877 and 1879, in the west in 1881 and 1882, in the south in 1883 and 1884, and in the east in 1885. The incidence of land revenue per acre of cultivated area in 1903-4 was Rs. 1-12-5. The average assessment per acre on \u2018dry\u2019 land is R. 0-13-7 (maximum scale Rs. 2-8-0, minimum scale R. 0-2-0); on \u2018wet\u2019 land, Rs. 3-14-7 (maximum scale Rs. 10, minimum scale R. 0-2-0); and on garden land, Rs. 4-4-11 (maximum scale Rs. 16, minimum scale Rs. 1-8-0).\n\nIn 1903-4 there were eight municipalities\u2014Hassan, Alur, Sakleshpur, Belur, Arsikere, Channarayapatna, Arkalgud, and Hole-Narsipur\u2014with an income of Rs. 37,000 and an expenditure of Rs. 40,000. There were also six village Unions\u2014Bannavar, Harnhalli, Konanur, Grama, Sravana Belgola, and Basavapatna\u2014whose income and expenditure were Rs. 6,000 and Rs. 11,000. The District and taluk boards, which deal with local affairs outside these areas, had an income of Rs. 71,000 and spent Rs. 79,000, including Rs. 16,000 on roads and buildings.\n\nThe police force in 1903-4 consisted of one superior officer, 73 subordinate officers, and 392 constables. There were 8 lock-ups, containing a daily average of 26 prisoners.\n\nThe percentage of literate persons in 1901 was 4.1 (7.7 males and 0.4 females). The number of schools increased from 331 with 7,614 pupils in 1890-1 to 442 with 10,167 pupils in 1900-1. In 1903-4 there were 442 schools (169 public and 273 private) with 9,117 pupils, of whom 1,165 were girls.\n\nBesides the civil hospital at Hassan, there are 14 dispensaries, at which 93,487 patients were treated in 1904, of whom 692 were in-patients. The total expenditure was Rs. 25,000.\n\nThere were 3,817 persons vaccinated in 1904, or 10 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n**Hassan Taluk.**\u2014Central taluk of Hassan District, Mysore, including the Alur sub-taluk, and lying between 12\u00b0 48' and 13\u00b0 13' N. and 75\u00b0 53' and 76\u00b0 19' E., with an area of 475 square miles. The population in 1901 was 125,961, compared with 113,397 in 1891. The taluk contains three towns, Hassan (population, 8,241), the head quarters, Grama (1,936), and Alur (1,299); and 568 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 2,66,000. The Hemavati river forms the southern boundary, receiving from the north the\nYagachi and another stream. A dam on the Yagachi supplies a channel 6 miles long. In the north is a group of hills called Sigegudda. There are also some low hills in the south. The southwest is purely Malnad, the chief cultivation here being a superior rice, with a little coffee. In the east, villages are far apart, but there are wide stretches of pasturage, supporting large flocks of sheep. The Sigegudda grazing-ground of the Amrit Mahal can maintain 2,500 head of cattle. The best soil is near the Yagachi river. Ragi is the staple 'dry crop,' with chillies and castor-oil in soil not suited for that grain.\n\n**Hassan Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the District and taluk of Hassan, Mysore, situated in 13\u00b0 0' N. and 76\u00b0 6' E., 25 miles from Arsikere railway station. Population (1901), 8,241. The original town is said to have been founded in the eleventh century at Chennapatna (on the south) by an officer under the Cholas, whose descendants held it till the end of the twelfth century. There being no heir, the Hoysala kings then conferred it on another chief, by whom the present town and fort were built. It formed part of the Belur kingdom under Vijayanagar, and was annexed to Mysore in 1690. The municipality dates from 1873. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 12,000. In 1903-4 they were Rs. 17,000.\n\n**Hassan Abdal (Hasan Abdal).**\u2014Village and ruins in the District and tahsil of Attock, Punjab, situated in 33\u00b0 48' N. and 72\u00b0 44' E., and forming a part of the remarkable group of remains which lie around the site of the ancient Taxila. Hiuen Tsiang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim of the seventh century A.D., visited the tank of the Serpent King, Elapatra, which has been identified with the famous spring of Baba Wali or Panja Sahib in this village. Successive legends of Buddhist, Brahman, Muhammadan, and Sikh origin cluster around the sacred fountain. The Muhammadan shrine of Baba Wali Kandhari crowns a precipitous hill, about one mile east of the town; and at its foot stands the holy tank called the Panja Sahib, a Sikh shrine. The story is that Guru Nanak once came to Hassan Abdal and asked the incumbent of Baba Wali's shrine, which then possessed a spring, for water, which was refused. As a punishment the Guru caused the water to spring up at the foot of the hill, instead of the top. The Muhammadan saint thereupon hurled a huge rock at the Guru, who turned it aside with his hand. The rock was placed in the shrine, where it stands to this day. It bears the marks of the Guru's hand, whence its name of Panja, 'the five fingers.' Two miles from Hassan Abdal lies Wah, a village which was once a halting-place of the Mughal emperors on the road to Kashmir. Its ruined gardens and a bath, recently excavated, mark the site of the imperial camp.\n\n**Hassangadi.**\u2014Pass in South Kanara District, Madras. See Hosangadi.\nHasu\u0101.\u2014Town in Gay\u0101 District, Bengal. See Hisu\u0101.\n\nH\u0101t\u0101.\u2014Central tahsil of Gorakhpur District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Silhat, Shahjahanpur, and Haveli, and lying between $26^\\circ 21'$ and $26^\\circ 58'$ N. and $83^\\circ 29'$ and $83^\\circ 58'$ E., with an area of 571 square miles. Population fell from 430,069 in 1891 to 428,846 in 1901. There are 950 villages and two towns, including R\u016bdarpur (population, 8,860). The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 3,83,000, and for cesses Rs. 62,000. The density of population, 751 persons per square mile, is considerably above the District average. The tahsil includes a fertile stretch of level country between the Little Gandak on the north-east and the R\u0101pt\u012b on the south-west. Smaller streams also cross it, and provide water for irrigation. The area under cultivation in 1903\u20134 was 457 square miles, of which 134 were irrigated. Wells supply more than half the irrigated area, and tanks, swamps, and small streams most of the remainder.\n\nH\u0101thras Tahsil.\u2014South-western tahsil of Aligarh District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of H\u0101thras and Murs\u0101n, and lying between $27^\\circ 29'$ and $27^\\circ 47'$ N. and $77^\\circ 52'$ and $78^\\circ 17'$ E., with an area of 290 square miles. The population rose from 208,264 in 1891 to 225,574 in 1901. There are 393 villages and five towns, the largest of which is H\u0101thras (population, 42,578), the tahsil head-quarters. The density is 778 persons per square mile, while the District average is 612. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 4,44,000, and for cesses Rs. 74,000. The eastern portion of the tahsil lies low, and the drainage is naturally bad, but it has been much improved by artificial channels. There is no canal-irrigation, and well-irrigation has recently become more difficult owing to a fall in the spring-level; but an extension of the M\u0101t branch of the Upper Ganges Canal is contemplated. In 1903\u20134 the area under cultivation was 239 square miles, of which 113 were irrigated.\n\nH\u0101thras Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Aligarh District, United Provinces, situated in $27^\\circ 36'$ N. and $78^\\circ 4'$ E., on the roads from Muttra to the Ganges and from Agra to Aligarh, and on the Cawnpore-Achhner\u0101 Railway, and also connected with the East Indian Railway by a short branch; distance by rail from Calcutta 857 miles, and from Bombay 890 miles. Population is increasing rapidly: (1872) 23,589, (1881) 34,932, (1891) 39,181, and (1901) 42,578. In 1901 Hindus numbered 36,133 and Musalm\u0101ns 5,482.\n\nAfter the British annexation in 1803, the talukd\u0101r, Day\u0101 R\u0101m, a J\u0101t of the same family as the R\u0101ja of Murs\u0101n, gave repeated proofs of an insubordinate spirit; and in 1817 the Government was compelled to send an expedition against him under the command of Major-General Marshall. H\u0101thras was then one of the strongest forts in Upper India,\nthe works having been carefully modelled on the improvements made in the fort at Aligarh. After a short siege, terminated by a heavy cannonade, a magazine within the fort blew up and destroyed half the garrison. Day\u0101 R\u0101m himself made his escape under cover of the night, and the remainder of the garrison surrendered at discretion. During the Mutiny the town was kept tranquil by Chaube Ghansh\u0101m D\u0101s, a blind pensioned tahs\u012bld\u0101r, who was afterwards murdered by the rebels at K\u0101sganj. The town is essentially a trading centre, and the site is crowded. A project for improved drainage is under consideration, and it is also proposed to bring a water-supply from the M\u0101t branch canal. The chief public buildings are the municipal hall and male and female dispensaries. The Church Missionary Society and Methodist Episcopal Mission have branches here.\n\nH\u0101thras has been a municipality since 1865. The income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 34,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 66,000, chiefly from octroi (Rs. 53,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 54,000. The municipality had a closing balance of Rs. 26,000 and also Rs. 31,000 invested.\n\nH\u0101thras was a place of some importance even before British rule, and now it ranks second to Cawnpore among the trading centres of the Do\u0101b. There is a large export trade in both coarse and refined sugar. Grain of all sorts, oilseeds, cotton, and gh\u012b form the other staples of outward trade; while the return items comprise iron, metal vessels, European and native cloth, drugs and spices, and miscellaneous wares. The town is becoming a considerable centre for industrial enterprise. It contains six cotton-gins and five cotton-presses, besides a spinning mill. These factories employed 1,074 hands in 1903. There are two schools with 300 pupils.\n\nHathw\u0101 R\u0101j.\u2014Estate in Bengal, situated for the most part in a compact block in the north-west of S\u0101ran District, but also comprising property in Champ\u0101ran, Muzaffarpur, Sh\u0101hab\u0101d, Patna, and Darjeeling, and in the Gorakhpur District of the United Provinces. It has an area of 561 square miles, of which 491 square miles are cultivated. The population in 1901 was 534,905. The rent roll (including cesses) amounted in 1903\u20134 to 11.51 lakhs, and the land revenue and cesses to 2.55 lakhs.\n\nThe Hathw\u0101 R\u0101j family is regarded as one of the oldest of the aristocratic houses in Bih\u0101r, and is said to have been settled in S\u0101ran for more than a hundred generations. The family is of the caste of Gautama Babhans or Bhuinh\u0101rs, to which the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101s of Benares, Bettiah, and Tek\u0101ri also belong. The authentic history of R\u0101j Husepur or Hathw\u0101 commences with the time of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Fateh S\u0101hi. When the East India Company obtained the Diw\u0101ni of Bengal, Bih\u0101r, and Orissa in 1765, Fateh S\u0101hi not only refused to pay revenue but\nresisted the Company's troops who were sent against him, and was with difficulty expelled from Husepur. He retired to a large tract of forest between Gorakhpur and S\u0101ran, whence he frequently invaded the British territories, and gave constant trouble until 1775. For some years the estate remained under the direct management of Government, but in 1791 Lord Cornwallis restored it to Chhatardh\u0101ri S\u0101hi, a grand-nephew of Fateh S\u0101hi. The title of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bah\u0101dur was conferred on him in 1837, Fateh S\u0101hi having died in the interim. During the Mutiny the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja displayed conspicuous loyalty, and was rewarded by the gift of some confiscated villages in Sh\u0101hab\u0101d District, which yielded a gross rental of Rs. 20,000 per annum. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Chhatardh\u0101ri S\u0101hi Bah\u0101dur died in 1858 and was succeeded by his great-grandson, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja R\u0101jendra Prat\u0101p S\u0101hi, who held the estate until his death in 1896, when the Court of Wards took possession on behalf of his minor son. In 1868 the Privy Council held that the estate is an impantible R\u0101j descending to the eldest son. At Hathw\u0101, 12 miles north of Siw\u0101n, stands the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja's palace, a splendid modern building with one of the most magnificent darb\u0101r halls in India. The M\u0101h\u0101r\u0101ni has recently built a handsome hospital, named the Victoria Hospital. A model agricultural and cattle-breeding farm has been opened at Sripur.\n\nH\u0101tia.\u2014Island in No\u0101kh\u0101li District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in the estuary of the Meghn\u0101 river, and lying between 22\u00b0 25' and 22\u00b0 42' N. and 90\u00b0 53' and 91\u00b0 9' E., with an area of 185 square miles. It contains 49 villages, and in 1901 had a population of 55,390, the average density being 299 persons per square mile. Muhammadans number 44,000 and Hindus 11,000. The island lies low, and is only partially protected by embankments from the incursions of the sea. It is thus exposed to storm-waves, and the great cyclone of 1876 destroyed 30,000 persons, or more than half the population.\n\nH\u0101tta.\u2014North-eastern tahsil of Damoh District, Central Provinces, lying between 23\u00b0 45' and 24\u00b0 26' N. and 79\u00b0 8' and 79\u00b0 52' E., with an area of 1,019 square miles. The population decreased from 129,676 in 1891 to 102,010 in 1901. The density in the latter year was 100 persons per square mile. The tahsil contains 424 inhabited villages. The head-quarters, Hatt\u0101, is a village of 4,365 inhabitants, 24 miles from Damoh town by road. Excluding 249 square miles of Government forest, 57 per cent. of the available area is occupied for cultivation. The cultivated area in 1903-4 was 335 square miles. The demand for land revenue in the same year was Rs. 1,38,000, and for cesses Rs. 13,000. The greater part of the tahsil consists of an open black-soil plain in the valley of the Son\u0101r river, with a belt of hill and forest country forming the scarp of the Vindhyan range to the north.\nHauli.\u2014River of Bengal. See M\u0101t\u0101bh\u0101\u1e45ga.\n\nHaungtharaw.\u2014Township of Amherst District, Lower Burma. See Kawkareik Township.\n\nHaveli. Head-quarters taluka of Poona District, Bombay, including the petty subdivision (petha) of Mulshi, and lying between $18^\\circ 16'$ and $18^\\circ 44'$ N. and $73^\\circ 19'$ and $74^\\circ 12'$ E., with an area of 823 square miles. It contains 2 towns, Poona City (population, 153,320), the District and taluka head-quarters, and Kirkee (10,797); and 235 villages. The population in 1901 was 326,955, compared with 337,182 in 1891. The density, 397 persons per square mile, is more than double the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was 2.2 lakhs and for cesses Rs. 20,000. The southern boundary is a spur of the Western Gh\u0101ts, of which the hill fort of Singarh is the most conspicuous feature. The flat-topped hills and terraces have usually a shallow surface of black soil strewn with stones. Owing to the proximity of the Poona market Haveli is more energetically and carefully tilled than other parts of the District. The taluka is well watered. The climate is usually dry and healthy. The annual rainfall averages 32 inches.\n\nH\u00e4veri. Head-quarters of the Karajgi taluka, Dh\u0101rw\u0101r District, Bombay, situated in $14^\\circ 47'$ N. and $75^\\circ 28'$ E., on the Southern Mahratta Railway. Population (1901), 7,974. H\u00e4veri has a considerable trade in cotton and other commodities, especially in cardamoms, brought from Kanara to be washed in a small lime-impregnated well. It has four temples and a monastery. H\u00e4veri was constituted a municipality in 1879 and had an average income of Rs. 4,600 during the decade ending 1901. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 5,100. The town contains a Subordinate Judge's court, a dispensary, a municipal middle school, and four other schools, of which one is for girls.\n\nH\u0101zara District.\u2014Northernmost District of the North-West Frontier Province, and the only portion of that Province east of the Indus. It lies between $33^\\circ 44'$ and $35^\\circ 10'$ N. and $72^\\circ 33'$ and $74^\\circ 6'$ E., with an area of 2,858, or, including Tan\u0101wal, 3,062 square miles. The District consists of a long tongue of British territory running north and south for 120 miles. The southern base is 56 miles in width, and the centre 40, while the K\u0101g\u0101n valley, in the north-east, is only about 15 miles broad. On the north the K\u0101g\u0101n range separates the District from Chil\u0101s, a dependency of Kashmir; and on the east the range which borders the left bank of the Kunh\u0101r river and the Jhelum separates it from Kashmir, Punch, and the Punjab District of R\u0101walpindi; north-west lie the Black Mountain and the lofty ranges which overhang the eastern bank of the Indus; and on the south is Attock District of the Punjab. Thus the District\nlies like a wedge of British territory driven in between Kashmir on the east and the independent hills on the west.\n\nHaz\u0101ra presents every gradation of scenery, altitude, and climate. The valley of the Harroh, only 1,500 feet above sea-level, merges into the Haz\u0101ra plain, an area of 200 square miles, with a mean elevation of 2,500 feet. Higher again is the Or\u0101sh plain, where Abbott\u0101b\u0101d lies between 4,000 and 5,000 feet above the sea. Lastly the K\u0101g\u0101n valley, comprising one-third of the total area, is a sparsely populated mountain glen, shut in by parallel ranges of hills which rise to 17,000 feet above the sea. Never more than 15 miles apart, these ranges throw out spurs across the valley, leaving only a narrow central gorge through which the Kunh\u0101r river forces an outlet to the Jhelum.\n\nThe scenery is picturesque and ever-changing. Distant snowy ranges to the north; the higher mountains of Haz\u0101ra, clothed with pines, oaks, and other forest trees, the lower ranges covered with grass and brushwood; cultivation appearing on every available spot, from the small terraces cut with great labour in the hill-sides to the rich irrigation of the Haripur and Pakhli plains; water in every form, from the swift torrents of the Kunh\u0101r and Jhelum and the strong deep stream of the Indus, to the silent lakes of the K\u0101g\u0101n valley\u2014all these suggest Kashmir and offer a vivid contrast to the arid plains of Northern India.\n\nHaz\u0101ra may be described geologically as a section of the earth\u2019s crust coming well within the area of Him\u0101layan disturbance, although the trend of the hill-ranges is altered from north-west\u2014south-east to north-east\u2014south-west. It is divisible into four distinct zones or belts of formations separated from one another by faults with over-thrust, and each zone exhibits more plication or metamorphism as the higher and more north-westerly regions are approached. The first, to the north-west, is composed of metamorphic schists and sills of gneissose granite, and includes most of the country north-west of Abbott\u0101b\u0101d and the Dor valley. The second zone is composed of a great and ancient slate series, with outliers of younger rocks in the high, isolated hill-groups north-east of Abbott\u0101b\u0101d. The next in order, together with the outliers of that just described, comprises a great series of marine deposits beginning with a marked unconformity and basal conglomerate, and extending from the infra-Trias (Devonian?) up to Nummulitic, the rocks being mostly limestones or dolomitic limestones with subordinate shales and sandstones. In this series the Trias and Nummulitic are well developed, while the Jura Cretaceous strata are comparatively thin. Last of all are the Upper Tertiary zone of Murree sandstone and the lower and upper Siw\u0101ilik sandstones and conglomerates to the south, stretching away into the R\u0101walpindi plateau.\nA coaly layer is found below the Nummulitic limestone in the Dor and neighbourhood. It is much crushed, uncertain in thickness, and mixed with much clay. Its value (if any) requires proving.\n\nThe trees of the District are described below under Forests. Generally speaking the flora is extremely varied, in the south embracing most varieties commonly found in the plains of Northern India, and in the hills including every type of Alpine vegetation until the extreme limit of growth is reached.\n\nLeopards and black bears are found in all the hill tracts; hyenas are common in the lower hills, and wolves are occasionally seen. Foxes, hill martens, porcupines, hedgehogs, mongooses, and burrowing rats are common throughout the District. Ibex and musk deer are found in K\u0101g\u0101n. Game-birds are not numerous. Various kinds of pheasant are found at elevations from 5,000 to 12,000 feet, and partridges and the commoner water-fowl abound lower down. Mahseer are plentiful in the Indus and Jhelum and in the lower reaches of the Harroh and Siran.\n\nThe climate is as varied as the scenery. The hot season in the south vies with that in the adjoining Districts of R\u0101walpindi and Attock. In the central plateaux the heat of summer is materially less, and the winter proportionately severe. The line of perpetual snow is between 14,000 and 15,000 feet above sea-level. The climate is, however, healthy, and well suited to Europeans. Malarial fevers in the spring and autumn, and various affections of the lungs in winter, are the chief diseases.\n\nThe rainfall is abundant, varying from 30 inches in the south to 50 inches or more in Abbott\u0101b\u0101d and the neighbouring hill stations. The heaviest fall in the last twenty years was 79 inches at Abbott\u0101b\u0101d in 1893\u20134, and the lightest 15 inches at Haripur in 1891\u20132.\n\nThe origin of the name Haz\u0101ra is obscure. It has been identified with Abis\u0101ra, the country of Abisares, the chief of the Indian mountaineers at the time of Alexander's invasion. Dr. Stein regards it as derived from Uras\u0101, the ancient name of Pakht\u016bn; but a possible derivation is from Haz\u0101ra-i-Karlugh, or the Karlugh legion, which was settled in this tract by T\u012bm\u016br after his invasion of India. Little is known of the history of the tract before the Durr\u0101nis. The name indeed occurs in the Ain-i-Akbari, and is mentioned by Firishta. From these writings we gather that the Haz\u0101ra plain formed part of the Attock governorship, while other parts of the modern District were held by the same Gakhars who played so prominent a part in the history of R\u0101walpindi. When the Mughal dynasty declined and the Afgh\u0101n peoples from across the Indus grew\n\n---\n\n1 C. S. Middlemiss, Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. xxvi.\nmore aggressive, they found Haz\u0101ra an easy prey; Gakhar rule had grown weak, and the old families of the G\u016bjars, Kharrals, and Dh\u00fcnds were losing their vitality.\n\nIn 1752 Haz\u0101ra passed definitely under the sway of Ahmad Sh\u0101h Durr\u0101ni. The District formed the most convenient route to Kashmir and also a useful recruiting area. Hence the Durr\u0101nis were at pains to repress disorder, but troubled themselves little about the internal administration or even the revenue payments of the tract. By the beginning of the nineteenth century the Durr\u0101nis had grown weak and Haz\u0101ra proportionately unruly. Sikh rule, however, was not established without preliminary reverses. In 1818 Ranjit Singh formally annexed Haz\u0101ra; but in 1820 his generals were defeated, and again in 1821 Amar Singh was defeated and slain on the Harroh. Sard\u0101r Hari Singh, the governor of Kashmir, was now sent to Haz\u0101ra; but it took him three more years to subdue the warlike mountaineers of the outer hills, and it was not till 1836 that the Gakhars of Kh\u0101npur were finally subdued. The governorship of Haz\u0101ra was at this time no sinecure.\n\nIn 1845 the disorganization of the Sikh rule at Lahore tempted the people to rise once more, and so successful were they that Diw\u0101n M\u016blraj, governor of Haz\u0101ra, retired to Hassan Abd\u0101l in 1846. The people assembled at Haripur and tried to restore former conditions. Meanwhile, the first Sikh War had come to an end, and Haz\u0101ra was made over to R\u0101j\u0101 Gul\u0101b Singh, together with Kashmir. In 1847 the R\u0101j\u0101 gave back Haz\u0101ra to the Lahore Darb\u0101r in exchange for land near Jammu, and Major James Abbott was sent to settle the country. By fair assessments, by liberality to the chiefs, and by a display of vigour and firmness when occasion required it, he completely pacified Haz\u0101ra in less than a year. During the second Sikh War Major Abbott maintained his position single-handed in the hills, cut off by the Sikh army from all assistance. During the Mutiny the District was under another strong man, Major Becher, and no disturbances of importance took place. Since 1857, the Black Mountain has been the only focus of disturbance, but the expeditions of 1868, 1888, 1891, and 1892 seem to have effectually quieted the country.\n\nThe archaeological remains so far discovered in Haz\u0101ra are not numerous, but one is of great interest and importance. This is an inscription on three boulders near the base of the Bareri hill close to M\u0101nsehra, containing the first thirteen of the fourteen rock edicts of Asoka (third century B.C.). There are one or two traces of st\u016bpas in other parts of the District. Coins of the Graeco-Bactrians, of Azes (first century B.C.), of Augustus, of the nameless king who called himself 'Soter Megas,' of the early Kushan kings, and of the Hindu Sh\u0101his have been discovered in Pakhli. Traces of ancient forts or villages, remains probably of the Hindu dynasties which governed\nHaz\u0101ra under its former name Uras\u0101 (the modern R\u0101sh or Or\u0101sh) before the Muhammadan occupation, are found here and there.\n\nHaz\u0101ra District contains 4 towns and 914 villages. Its population at each of the last four enumerations was: (1868) 367,218, (1881) 407,075, (1891) 516,288, and (1901) 560,288. The principal statistics of population in 1901 are shown below:\n\n| Tahsil | Area in square miles | Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|--------|---------------------|------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Abbott\u0101b\u0101d | 715 | 2 | 359 | 194,632 | 273 | + 10.7 | 3,535 |\n| Haripur | 657 | 1 | 311 | 151,638 | 228 | + 6.1 | 4,715 |\n| M\u0101nsehra | 1,486 | 1 | 244 | 182,396 | 124 | + 10.3 | 2,104 |\n| Total | 2,858 | 4 | 914 | 528,666 | 185 | ... | 10,354 |\n| Tan\u0101wal | 204 | ... | ... | 31,622 | 155 | ... | 516 |\n| Grand total | 3,662 | ... | ... | 560,288 | 184 | + 8.5 | 10,870 |\n\nPopulation has increased by 8.5 per cent. during the last decade, the increase being greatest in the Abbott\u0101b\u0101d tahsil and least in that of Haripur. It is divided into three tahsils: Abbott\u0101b\u0101d, Haripur, and M\u0101nsehra. The head-quarters of these tahsils are at the places from which each is named. The towns are the municipalities of Abbott\u0101b\u0101d (the head-quarters of the District), Haripur, Naw\u0101shahr, and Baffa. The District also contains the hill stations of Nathia Gali with Dung\u0101 Gali (the former being the summer head-quarters of the Local Government), Changla Gali, and Thandi\u0101ni; and the hill cantonments of B\u0101ra Gali, K\u0101la Bagh, Khaira Gali, and Ghora Dakka. Muhammadans number 533,000, or more than 95 per cent. of the total; Hindus, 23,000; and Sikhs, 4,000. The language spoken is chiefly a dialect of Western Punj\u0101bi, known locally as Hindki. Pasht\u016b is spoken on the Black Mountain border, and the G\u016bjars have a dialect of their own called G\u016bjar\u012b.\n\nIn Haz\u0101ra, Path\u0101ns are not the predominant race. They number only 55,000, while the G\u016bjars, who profess to be aborigines, number 92,000, and the Aw\u0101ns 91,000. Tanaolis (59,000), though not Path\u0101ns, are closely allied to them by customs and tradition. Dh\u016bnds, another aboriginal tribe, number 25,000, Sw\u0101tis 33,000, and Kharrals 16,000. The Saiyids (23,000) exercise great influence over the other Muhammadans. Of the trading classes, Khattris number 13,000 and Aroras only 4,000. Br\u0101hmans number 5,000. Of the artisan classes, the Jul\u0101h\u0101s (weavers, 16,000), Tarkh\u0101ns (carpenters, 11,000), Mochis\n(shoemakers and leather-workers, 9,000), and Loh\u0101rs (blacksmiths, 9,000) are the most important. The Kashmiris, who live mainly by woollen industries, number 15,000. The chief menial classes are the Nais (barbers, 7,000) and Musallis (sweepers, 3,000). About 2,000 persons returned themselves as Turks, descendants of the Turkom\u0101ns who came with Tim\u016br in 1391. Agriculture supports 72 per cent. of the population.\n\nThe Church Missionary Society opened a branch at Abbott\u0101b\u0101d in 1899, and the Peshawar branch of the society has an outpost at Haripur. In 1901, the District contained 17 native Christians.\n\nThe level portion of the District enjoys a seasonable and constant rainfall of about 30 inches; the soil is better than that of the hill tracts and more easily cultivated, and the spring harvest is accordingly superior. The best irrigated and manured lands are equal to the most fertile in the Punjab, and the harvests are more certain than in the adjacent District of R\u0101walpindi. The low dry hills have a climate and rainfall similar to that of the plains, but the soil is much poorer. In the temperate hills and high land in the middle of the District the rainfall averages 47 inches, and snow falls occasionally; the autumn crop is here the more valuable, but a fair proportion of spring crops are raised. The mountain tracts have an excessive rainfall and a severe winter; so that there is but little spring harvest. The soil in the open portion of the District is deep and rich, the detritus of the surrounding hills being lodged in the basin-like depressions below; the highlands have a shallow and stony covering, compensated for by the abundant manure obtained from the flocks of sheep and cattle among the mountain pastures. The spring harvest, which in 1903-4 formed 41 per cent. of the total crops harvested, is sown in the higher hills in October, and lower down in November and December; the autumn crops are sown in the hills in June and July, while in the lower lands seed-time varies from April to August with the nature of the crop.\n\nThe District is held chiefly on the patt\u016bd\u0101r\u012b and bhaiyachh\u0101r\u0101 tenures, zamind\u0101r\u012b lands covering about 339 square miles. The following table shows the main statistics of cultivation in 1903-4, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil     | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Forests |\n|------------|-------|------------|-----------|---------|\n| Abbott\u0101b\u0101d | 715   | 207        | ...       | 75      |\n| Haripur    | 657   | 251        | 33        | 39      |\n| M\u0101nsehra   | 1,486 | 199        | 19        | 121     |\n| **Total**  | **2,858** | **917**    | **52**    | **235** |\n\nMaize covers the largest area, being grown on 273 square miles in\n1903-4. Wheat (171) comes next in importance, followed by barley (78).\n\nThe cultivated area has increased by 10 per cent. since the settlement in 1874. The chief field for extension lies on the hill-sides, large areas of which can be brought under cultivation by terracing; but until the pressure of the population on the soil becomes much heavier than it is at present, there is little prospect of any considerable progress in this direction. Nothing has been done to improve the quality of the crops grown. The potato was introduced shortly after annexation, and is now largely cultivated. A sum of Rs. 14,700 is outstanding up to date on account of loans to agriculturists, and Rs. 4,856 was advanced during 1903-4 for this purpose.\n\nCattle are most numerous in the hilly portions of the District. The breed is small, and the cows are poor milkers, but the introduction of bulls from Hissar has done a good deal to improve the quality of the stock. Sheep and goats are grazed in the District in large numbers, chiefly by Gujars; the larger flocks migrate at different seasons of the year between K\u0101g\u0101n and Lower Haz\u0101ra or R\u0101walpindi. The sheep are of the ordinary thin-tailed breed, and attempts to cross them with English stock and to introduce merino sheep are being made. Sheep and goats are largely exported to the cantonments and towns in Peshawar, R\u0101walpindi, and Jhelum. The local breed of horses is small; the Civil Veterinary department maintains seven horse and twenty-one donkey stallions, and one horse and two pony stallions are kept by the District board. The Abbott\u0101b\u0101d and M\u0101nsehra tahsils possess a large number of mules. A few camels are kept in Lower Haz\u0101ra.\n\nThe area irrigated in 1903-4 was 52 square miles, or 8 per cent. of the cultivated area. Of this, only 14 square miles were supplied by wells, 377 in number, which are confined to the Indus bank and the plain round Haripur. They are built for the most part of boulder masonry, and are worked by bullocks with Persian wheels. The chief method of supply is by cuts from the Harroh, Dor, and Siran rivers and minor hill streams. The undulating formation of the valleys, and the ravines which intersect them, make any considerable extension of irrigation very difficult.\n\nThe two main classes of forests in Haz\u0101ra District are: the 'reserved' forests, in which only few rights of user are admitted, although the villagers are entitled to a share in the price of the trees felled for sale; and the village forests, in which Government retains a similar share, but which are otherwise practically left to the charge of the villagers, subject to the control of the Deputy-Commissioner.\n\nThe 'reserved' forests, which are situated mainly in the north and\neast, cover 235 square miles, and yield annually about 80,000 and 40,000 cubic feet of deodar and other timber, respectively. The Jhelum and its tributaries convey the timber not used locally. The most important forests, which lie between altitudes of 5,000 and 10,000 feet, contain deodar, blue pine, silver fir, spruce, and Quercus incana, dilatata, and semecarpifolia. In the Gali range, where deodar is now scarce, trees of hardwood species are abundant, whereas in the drier K\u0101g\u0101n range and in the Upper Siran valley pure deodar forests are not uncommon, but the variety of species is smaller. Between 10,000 feet and the limit of tree growth at about 12,500 feet, the spruce and silver fir are the most common. In the south some hardwood forests of poor quality are of importance for the supply of firewood, and at elevations between 3,000 and 6,000 feet there is a considerable extent of forest in which Pinus longifolia predominates. Forest fires, which formerly did much damage, are now becoming less frequent. Working plans have been prepared and will shortly come into force for all the 'reserved' forests, which are controlled by the Forest officer in charge of the division. In 1903\u20134 the forests yielded a revenue of Rs. 83,000.\n\nThe village forests are not so strictly preserved. Those of the Haripur tahsil and parts of Abbott\u0101b\u0101d, including Tan\u0101wal, produce only fuel; but in the northern parts of the latter tahsil and in M\u0101nsehra the forests contain coniferous and deciduous trees, which increase in value as the forests become less accessible. These village forests are controlled, under the Haz\u0101ra Forest Regulation of 1893, by the Deputy-Commissioner through the village headmen, on the principle that the villagers, while taking without restriction all that they require for their own needs, shall not be permitted to sell timber or firewood cut from them.\n\nOf the 1,700 square miles of waste land in the District, only 200 are clad with timber-producing trees, 200 more forming fuel reserves. About 200 square miles have been demarcated as village forests, to check denudation and to prevent waste, while securing the produce to the villagers for the satisfaction of their needs.\n\nAs already mentioned, coal exists in the District, but has not been worked. Limestone, building stone, and gypsum are abundant, and coarse slate is found in places. Antimony and oxide of lead have been observed; and iron occurs in considerable quantities, but is little worked.\n\nThe industries of Haz\u0101ra are of only local importance. The principal manufacture consists of coarse cotton cloth and cotton strips for use as turbans. In the northern glens blankets are largely made from sheep's wool. The domestic art of embroidering silk on cotton cloth attains a higher degree of excellence than in any other part of the Province or the\nPunjab, and jewellery of silver and enamel is produced. Water-mills are used to a considerable extent for grinding flour and husking rice.\n\nCotton piece-goods, indigo, salt, tobacco, and iron are imported from R\u0101walpindi and the south, and a large proportion goes through to Kashmir and B\u0101jaur, whence the chief imports are wood, fibres, and ghi. Grain, chiefly maize, is exported to the dry tracts west of R\u0101walpindi, to the Khattak country across the Indus, and to Pesh\u0101war; a large part is bought direct from the agriculturists by Khattak merchants who bring their own bullocks to carry it away. Ghi is exported chiefly to Pesh\u0101war, and sheep and goats are sent to Pesh\u0101war and R\u0101walpindi.\n\nNo railways pass through the District. It contains 90 miles of metalled roads under the Public Works department, and 1,157 miles of unmetalled roads, of which 406 are under the Public Works department and the rest are managed by the District board. The principal route is the metalled road from Hassan Abd\u0101l in Attock on the North-Western Railway, which passes through Abbott\u0101b\u0101d and M\u0101nsehra to Srinagar in Kashmir, crossing the Kunh\u0101r, Kishangang\u0101, and Jhelum rivers by iron suspension bridges. Another route, not passable for wheeled traffic, connects Abbott\u0101b\u0101d with the hill station of Murree. Both routes run through mountainous country, but are kept in excellent repair, though the latter is in winter blocked by snow. A third road, from Hazro to Haripur and Abbott\u0101b\u0101d, is chiefly used by Path\u0101n traders from Pesh\u0101war. A tonga and bullock-train service connects Hassan Abd\u0101l on the North-Western Railway with Abbott\u0101b\u0101d. The Kunh\u0101r is crossed by several wooden bridges.\n\nHaz\u0101ra suffered great scarcity in the memorable and widespread famine of 1783, which affected it with the same severity as the remainder of Northern India. During the decade ending 1870, which was a period of dearth in the plains Districts, the harvests of Haz\u0101ra produced an excellent yield, and the high price of grain for exportation gave large profits to the peasantry, besides affording an incentive to increased cultivation. In 1877\u20138 Haz\u0101ra again experienced scarcity; but in 1879\u201380 the yield was abundant, and high prices ruled during the continuance of the Afghan War. The District was not seriously affected by the famines of 1896\u20137 and 1899\u20131900.\n\nThe District is divided for administrative purposes into three tahs\u012bls\u2014Abbott\u0101b\u0101d, Haripur, and M\u0101nsehra\u2014each under a tahsild\u0101r and naib-tahsild\u0101r. The Deputy-Commissioner, besides holding executive charge of the District, is Political officer in charge of the tribes of the adjacent independent territory. He has under him a District Judge who is usually also Additional District Magistrate, an Assistant Commissioner who commands the border military police, and two Extra-Assistant Commissioners, one\nof whom is in charge of the District treasury. The Forest division is in charge of a Deputy-Conservator.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner as District Magistrate is responsible for criminal justice, and civil judicial work is under the District Judge. Both officers are supervised by the Divisional and Sessions Judge of the Pesh\u0101war Civil Division. The District Munsif sits at Abbott\u0101b\u0101d. Crime in Haz\u0101ra is very light for a frontier District.\n\nSikh rule in Haz\u0101ra began in 1818. As in the Punjab generally, the only limit to the rapacity of the kard\u0101rs was the fear of imperilling future realizations, but up to this limit they exacted the uttermost farthing. Some parts of Haz\u0101ra were too barren or too inaccessible to be worth squeezing, and it may be doubted whether the Sikhs actually collected more than one-third of the total grain produce. When Major Abbott made the first summary settlement of Haz\u0101ra in 1847\u20138, he took one-third as the fair share of Government. Records and measurements he neither found nor made, but he assessed each village after comparison of what it had paid with its degree of impoverishment. The Sikh demand was reduced by 16 per cent. In 1852 Major Abbott made a second summary settlement, which was in effect a redistribution of the first, and was less by Rs. 3,000 than his original demand of Rs. 2,06,000. The fact that the first assessment was easily paid is evidence of its equity, while the fact that it was reimposed, after a fall in prices quite unprecedented in both suddenness and extent, points to the improvement which must have taken place in the cultivation and the general circumstances of the District.\n\nThe assessment of 1852 remained in force for twenty years, and a regular settlement was carried out between 1868 and 1874. The prosperity of the District had advanced rapidly, and the demand was increased by 34 per cent. to 3 lakhs. The District again came under settlement in 1901, when a similar rise in prosperity had to be taken into account. The new demand shows an increase of Rs. 20,400, or 7 per cent. over the demand for 1903\u20134.\n\nThe collections of land revenue and of total revenue are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 2,23   | 2,26   | 3,34*  | 2,40   |\n| Total revenue  | 2,90   | 3,10   | 5,35*  | 3,19   |\n\n* Including collections from the Attock tahsil, which then formed part of the District.\n\nThe District contains five municipalities, Har\u012bpur, Abbott\u0101b\u0101d, Baffa, M\u0101nsehra, and Naw\u0101shahr; and a 'notified area,' Nathia Gali-cum-Dung\u0101 Gali. Outside these municipal areas, local affairs are managed by the District board, all the members of which are appointed.\nIts income, derived mainly from a cess on the land revenue, amounted in 1903\u20134 to Rs. 29,500; and the expenditure was about the same, the principal item being education.\n\nThe regular police force consists of 487 of all ranks, of whom 42 are cantonment and municipal police. The force is controlled by a Superintendent. The village watchmen number 471. There are 16 police stations, one outpost, and 12 road-posts. The District jail at head-quarters has accommodation for 114 prisoners. The border military police, numbering 250, are under the control of the Deputy-Commissioner exercised through the commandant, an Assistant Commissioner, and are distinct from the District police.\n\nOnly 2.4 of the District population could read and write in 1901, the proportion of males being 4.35, and of females 1 per cent. Education is most advanced among Hindus and Sikhs. The number of pupils under instruction was 872 (in public schools alone) in 1880\u20131, 8,006 in 1890\u20131, 5,264 in 1902\u20133, and 5,439 in 1903\u20134. In the last year there were 6 secondary and 33 primary (public) schools, and 18 advanced and 165 elementary (private) schools, with 103 girls in the public and 161 in the private schools. The District is very backward in education. Only 6 per cent. of children of a school-going age are receiving instruction. Some progress, however, is being made, and there are two Anglo-vernacular high schools at Abbottabad. The total expenditure on education in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 24,000, of which the District fund contributed Rs. 8,000, municipalities Rs. 6,000, and fees Rs. 4,000.\n\nThe District possesses five dispensaries, at which 83,264 cases were treated in 1904, including 1,266 in-patients, and 2,698 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 11,500, the greater part of which was contributed by Local funds.\n\nIn 1903\u20134 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 10,574, or 19.5 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n[District Gazetteer, 1875 (under revision).]\n\nHaz\u0101raj\u0101t, The (or Haz\u0101rist\u0101n).\u2014A mountainous region in the heart of Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, lying about midway between K\u0101bul, Her\u0101t, and Kandah\u0101r. Very little is known about this region, which forms one of the districts of the K\u0101bul province. It is intersected by high mountains, of which the Koh-i-B\u0101ba is the most prominent. On the southern slopes of this range are the sources of the Helmand and of numerous tributaries which eventually join it. Their upper streams are said to flow through precipitous and gloomy gorges, and their channels only open out as they approach Zamindawar. On the west this region is bounded by the Taimani highlands; on the south by the Kandah\u0101r districts of Zamindawar, Dehrawat, and Tirin; on the south-east by Ghazni; and on the north by the Band-i-B\u0101ba. The Haz\u0101raj\u0101t\nincludes the districts of Bes\u016bd, Deh Zangi, and Deh Kundi, and is peopled almost entirely by the Haz\u0101ras, who number about half a million. The Haz\u0101ras, who are Shahs, are descended from fragments of Mongol tribes that came from the east with the armies of Chingiz Kh\u0101n and his family, though other races may be represented among them. Their language is in the main a purely Persian dialect. The difficult nature of their country enabled the Haz\u0101ras to preserve a practical independence until, between 1890 and 1893, they were subjugated by the late Am\u012br Abdur Rahm\u0101n. A sturdy race of mountaineers, they long continued to cause trouble to the Afgh\u0101n administration, but all their leading men have now been removed and they are entirely subdued. The present Am\u012br is trying gradually to contract their limits, and to populate the Haz\u0101raj\u0101t with Ghilzais and other Afgh\u0101n tribesmen. A few Haz\u0101ras enlist in the Indian army and give satisfaction. In 1904 the enlistment of a British Haz\u0101ra battalion of pioneers was sanctioned; and about the same period the Am\u012br, for the first time, ordered the recruitment of a few regiments to be exclusively formed of men of this race. In the towns of Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, and throughout most of the Punjab during the cold season, Haz\u0101ras are to be found employed in menial labour, but seldom in any other capacity. Formerly they were sold as slaves, but this practice was put down by the late Am\u012br with a stern hand.\n\nHaz\u0101rib\u0101gh District.\u2014North-eastern District in the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur Division of Bengal, lying between $23^\\circ 25'$ and $24^\\circ 49'$ N. and $84^\\circ 27'$ and $86^\\circ 34'$ E., with an area of 7,021 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the Districts of Gay\u0101 and Monghyr; on the east by the Sant\u0101l Parganas and M\u0101nbh\u016bm; on the south by R\u0101nch\u012b; and on the west by Pal\u0101mau.\n\nHaz\u0101rib\u0101gh, which, like the rest of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, consists to a great extent of rock and ravine, lies towards the north-eastern extremity of the chain of high land, sometimes a range of hills and sometimes a cultivated plateau, which extends across the continent of India south of the Narbad\u0101 river on the west and of the Son river on the east. It is divided naturally into three distinct tracts: an undulating plateau, with an average elevation of about 2,000 feet, extends from the west-central boundary of the District, measuring about 40 miles in length from east to west and 15 miles from north to south; a lower and more extensive plateau, with a general elevation of 1,300 feet, covers the north and east of the District, gradually sinking towards the east; while the central valley of the D\u0101modar river, with the country watered by its numerous feeders, occupies the entire south of the District. The principal peaks of the southern plateau are Bar\u0101gai or Marang Buru (3,445 feet above the sea), Jiling\u0101 (3,057 feet), Chendw\u0101r (2,816 feet), and Aswa\nDetached hills are Lugu (3,203 feet), Mahudi (2,437 feet), and in the east of the District, on the boundary of Manbh\u00fbm, the well-known Parasnath Hill, 4,480 feet above the sea. In the northern plateau is the Mah\u00e2bar range, rising to an elevation of 2,210 feet above sea-level. The Damodar, which rises in Pal\u00e2mau, is the most important river of Haz\u00e2rib\u00e2gh, through which it flows in an easterly direction for about 90 miles. Its chief feeders in this portion of its course are the Garhi, Haharo, Naik\u00e2ri, Maramarh\u00e2, Bher\u00e2, Kunur, Khanjo, and Jamuni\u00e2, and with its tributaries it drains in this District an area of 2,840 square miles; it is everywhere fordable during the dry season. The only other important river, the Bar\u00e2kar, rises on the northern face of the central plateau and flows in an easterly and south-easterly direction till, after draining an area of 2,050 square miles, it leaves the District to form the boundary between Manbh\u00fbm and the Sant\u00e2l Parganas. The north-west of the District is drained by the Jhik\u00eea and Chako, which unite a short distance outside the boundary; by the Mohani, Lilaj\u00e2n, and Morhar, which flow northwards into Gay\u00e2; and by the Dh\u00e2dh\u00e2r, Tilay\u00e2, and Sakri. The Ajay rises on the eastern boundary of the District, two of its tributaries draining part of the Giridih subdivision, while on the south the Subarnarekh\u00e2 forms the District boundary for about 15 miles.\n\nA description of the geology of Haz\u00e2rib\u00e2gh District would practically be a summary of the characters of any Archaean area. The old felspathic gneisses, well banded and with the composition of typical igneous rocks, are associated with schistose forms and with the results of the intermingling of ancient sediments with igneous matter. Among these are intrusive masses of granite which, under pressure, have assumed a gneissose structure and, on account of the way in which they stand up as small hills of rounded hummocks, have sometimes been referred to as the 'dome gneiss.' They rise up in the midst of bands of schists, which are cut in all directions by veins of acid pegmatite. Patches of Gondwana rocks occur, some of which contain the coal for which the District is well-known.\n\nThe narrower valleys are often terraced for rice cultivation, and these rice-fields and their margins abound in marsh and water plants. The surface of the plateau between the valleys, where level, is often bare and rocky, but where undulating is usually clothed with a dense scrub jungle in which Dendrocalamus strictus is prominent. The steep slopes of the gh\u00e2ts are covered with a dense forest mixed with many climbers. S\u00e2l (Shorea robusta) is gregarious; among the other noteworthy trees are species of Buchanania, Semecarpus, Terminalia, Cedrela, Cassia,\n\n---\n\n1 'The Mica Deposits of India,' by Holland, in Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. xxxiv, part ii (1902); 'The Igneous Rocks of Giridih and their Contact Effects,' by Holland and Saise, in Records, Geological Survey of India, vol. xxviii, part iv (1895).\nButea, Bauhinia, Acacia, Adina, which these forests share with the similar forests on the Lower Himalayan slopes. Mixed with these, however, are a number of characteristically Central India trees and shrubs, such as *Cochlospermum*, *Soymida*, *Boswellia*, *Hardwickia*, and *Bassia*, which do not cross the Gangetic plain. One of the features of the upper edge of the gh\u0101ts is a dwarf palm, *Phoenix acaulis*; striking too is the wealth of scarlet blossom in the hot season produced by the abundance of *Butea frondosa* and *B. superba*, and the mass of white flower along the gh\u0101ts in November displayed by the convolulaceous climber *Porana paniculata*.\n\nThe jungles in the less cultivated tracts give shelter to tigers, leopards, bears, and several varieties of deer. Wolves are very common, and wild dogs hunt in packs on Parasn\u0101th Hill.\n\nThe temperature is moderate except during the hot months of April, May, and June, when westerly winds from Central India cause high temperature with very low humidity. The mean temperature increases from $76^\\circ$ in March to $85^\\circ$ in April and May, the mean maximum from $89^\\circ$ in March to $99^\\circ$ in May, and the mean minimum from $64^\\circ$ to $76^\\circ$. During these months humidity is lower in Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur than in any other part of Bengal, falling in Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh to 41 per cent. in March and 36 per cent. in April. In the winter season the mean temperature is $60^\\circ$ and the mean minimum $51^\\circ$. The annual rainfall averages 53 inches, of which 7\u00b76 inches fall in June, 14\u00b74 in July, 13\u00b74 in August, and 8\u00b75 in September.\n\nThe whole of the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau was known in early history as Jh\u0101rkand or \u2018the forest tract,\u2019 and appears never to have been completely subjugated by the Muhammadans. Sant\u0101l tradition relates that one of their earliest settlements was at Chhai Champ\u0101 in Hazarib\u0101gh, and that their fort was taken by Saiyid Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Ali, a general of Muhammad bin Tughlak, and placed in charge of a Muhammadan officer, *circa* 1340. There is no authentic record, however, of any invasion of the country till Akbar\u2019s reign, when it was overrun by his general. The R\u0101j\u0101 of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur became a tributary of the Mughal government (1585); and in the *Itin-i-Akbari* Chhai Champ\u0101 is shown as a *pargana* belonging to Bih\u0101r assessed at Rs. 15,500, and liable to furnish 20 horse and 600 foot. Subsequently, in 1616, the R\u0101j\u0101 fell into arrears of tribute; the governor of Bih\u0101r invaded his country; and the R\u0101j\u0101 was captured and removed to Gwalior. He was released after twelve years on agreeing to pay a yearly tribute of Rs. 6,000, and his country was considered part of the S\u016bbah of Bih\u0101r. From the fact that the ancestor of the R\u0101j\u0101s of R\u0101mgarh (which included the present District of Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh) is said to have received a grant of the estate from these N\u0101gbansi R\u0101j\u0101s, it appears that the District formed part of their dominions.\ninroads of the Muhammadans were, however, directed not against the frontier chiefdom of R\u0101mgarh but against Kokrah, or Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur proper, to which they were attracted by the diamonds found in its rivers; and though the R\u0101j\u0101s were reduced to the condition of tributaries by the Mughal viceroys of Bengal, they were little interfered with so long as their contributions were paid regularly. Even so late as the reign of Aurangzeb the allegiance of the chiefs of this tract must have been very loose, as the Jh\u0101rkand route to Bengal is said to have been little used by troops on account of the savage manners of the mountaineers. About this time the first R\u0101j\u0101 of Kund\u0101, who was a personal servant of the emperor, received a rent-free grant of the pargana on condition that he guarded four passes from the inroads of Mar\u0101th\u0101s, Bargis, and Pind\u0101ris; and in 1765 Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur was ceded to the British as part of Bih\u0101r. The British first came into contact with this tract in 1771, when they intervened in a dispute between one Mukund Singh, the R\u0101j\u0101 of R\u0101mgarh, and his relative Tej Singh, who was at the head of the local army. The latter, who had claims to the estate, went in 1771 to Patna and laid his case before Captain Camac, who undertook to assist him and deputed for the purpose a European force under Lieutenant Goddard. Mukund Singh fled after a mere show of resistance, and the R\u0101mgarh estate was made over to Tej Singh subject to a tribute of Rs. 40,000 a year. Lieutenant Goddard\u2019s expedition did not extend to the Kharakdih pargana in the north-west of the District. Six years earlier (1765) Mad N\u0101r\u0101yan Deo, the old Hindu R\u0101j\u0101 of Kharakdih, chief of the gh\u0101taw\u0101ls or guardians of the passes, had been driven from his estate by the Musalm\u0101n \u0101mil or revenue agent, K\u0101md\u0101r Kh\u0101n, who was succeeded by Ikb\u0101l Ali Kh\u0101n. The latter was expelled in 1774 for tyranny and mismanagement by a British force under Captain James Brown. The exiled R\u0101j\u0101 of Kharakdih, who had exerted his influence on the British side, was rewarded with a grant of the maintenance lands of the R\u0101j. Possibly he might have been completely reinstated in his former position; but in the confusion of Muhammadan misrule the gh\u0101taw\u0101ls had grown too strong to return to their old allegiance, and demanded and obtained separate settlements for the lands under their control. In the sanads granted to them by Captain Brown they are recognized as petty feudal chiefs, holding their lands subject to responsibility for crime committed on their estates. They were bound to produce criminals, and to refund stolen property; they were liable to removal for misconduct, and they undertook to maintain a body of police, and to keep the roads in repair.\n\nIn 1780 R\u0101mgarh and Kharakdih formed part of a British District named R\u0101mgarh, administered by a Civilian, who held the offices of Judge, Magistrate, and Collector; while a contingent of Native\ninfantry, known as the R\u0101ngarh battalion, was stationed at Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh, under the command of a European officer. This District was dismembered after the Kol insurrection of 1831-2, when under Regulation XIII of 1833 parts of it were transferred to the surrounding Districts, and the remainder, including the parganas of Kharakdih, Kendi, and Kund\u0101, with the large estate of R\u0101ngarh, consisting of 16 parganas, which compose the present area of the District, were formed into a District under the name of Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh. In 1854 the title of the officer in charge of the District was changed from Principal Assistant to the Governor-General's Agent to Deputy-Commissioner.\n\nThe most important archaeological remains are the Jain temples at Parasn\u0101th. Buddhist and Jain remains exist on Kul\u016bha Hill in the Dan\u1e6d\u0101ra pargana, and a temple and tank to the west of the hill dedicated to Kuleswari, the goddess of the hill, are visited by Hindu pilgrims in considerable numbers. The only other remains worthy of mention are four rock temples on M\u0101hudi Hill, one of which bears the date 1740 Samvat, ruins of temples at S\u0101tg\u0101wan, and an old fort which occupies a strong defensive position at Kund\u0101.\n\nAt the Census of 1872 the population recorded in the present District area was 771,875. The enumeration was, however, defective; and the Census of 1881 showed a population of 1,104,742, which rose to 1,164,321 in 1891 and to 1,177,961 in 1901. The smallness of the increase during the last decade is attributable to the growing volume of emigration to Assam and elsewhere, and also to the heavy death-rate following the famine of 1897, chiefly from fever and cholera, which are always the most prevalent causes of mortality in the District. The principal statistics of the Census of 1901 are shown below:\n\n| Subdivision | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh  | 5,019               | 2              | 5,440    | 760,164    | 151                       | -0.3                                            | 19,680                                 |\n| Giridih     | 2,002               | 1              | 3,408    | 417,797    | 209                       | +4.0                                            | 11,148                                 |\n| District total | 7,021             | 3              | 8,848    | 1,177,961  | 168                       | +1.2                                            | 30,828                                 |\n\nThe three towns are Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh, the head-quarters, Chatr\u0101, and Giridih. The population is greatest in the west, in the valley of the Bar\u0101kar river, where there is a fair extent of level country and the coal mines support a considerable number of labourers. The country west and south-west of the central plateau consists mainly of hill and ravine, and has very few inhabitants. The population declined during the decade ending 1901 in the centre of the District, where recruiting\nfor tea gardens was most active; but in the Giridih subdivision there was a general increase, the growth being most marked in Giridih itself, where the coal-mines of the East Indian railway attract a steadily increasing number of labourers. The hardy aboriginal tribes are remarkable for their fecundity and the climate is healthy; but the soil is barren, and the natural increase in the population is thus to a great extent discounted by emigration. It was hence that the Sant\u0101ls sallied forth about seventy years ago to people the D\u0101man-i-koh in the Sant\u0101l Parganas. This movement in its original magnitude has long since died out, and the main stream of present emigration is to more distant places, Assam alone containing nearly 69,000 natives of this District. The Magahi dialect of Bih\u0101r\u012b is spoken by the majority of the population, but Sant\u0101l is the vernacular of 78,000 persons. Hindus number 954,105, or 81 per cent. of the total, and Muhammadans 119,656, or 10 per cent.\n\nThe most numerous Hindu castes are Ah\u012brs or Go\u0101l\u0101s (138,000) and Bhuiy\u0101s (99,000); many of the Bih\u0101r castes are also well represented, especially Kurmis (76,000), Telis (49,000), Koiris (47,000), and Cham\u0101rs (44,000), while among other castes Gh\u0101tw\u0101ls (40,000), Bhogt\u0101s (35,000), and Turis (23,000) are more common than elsewhere, and Soki\u0101rs (12,000) are peculiar to the District. Most of the Animists are Sant\u0101ls (78,000), and the majority of the Musalm\u0101ns are Jol\u0101h\u0101s (82,000). Agriculture supports 80.7 per cent. of the population, industries 9.1 per cent., commerce 0.2 per cent., and the professions 0.8 per cent.\n\nOf 1,163 Christians in 1901 about three-fourths were natives. Mission work was begun in 1853 by the German Evangelical Lutheran Mission, but was interrupted by the Mutiny. In 1862 another mission was founded by the same society at Singh\u0101ni near Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh; but in 1868 an unfortunate split took place, and several of the missionaries went over to the English Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. The work carried on by the German mission is chiefly educational. The Free Church of Scotland opened a branch of its Sant\u0101l Mission at Pachamb\u0101 near Giridih in 1871, and maintains a dispensary and schools; their evangelistic work is chiefly among the Sant\u0101ls. The Dublin University Mission, established at Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh in 1892, maintains a boys\u2019 high school, an upper primary school, and a First Arts college, in addition to dispensaries at Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh, Ichak, and Pet\u0101rb\u0101r; but it has not been very successful in making conversions.\n\nThe most fertile land lies in the valleys of the D\u0101modar and the Sakri, the agricultural products of the latter resembling those of the adjoining Districts of Bih\u0101r rather than those of the neighbouring parts of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur. In Kharakdih the hollows that lie between the undulations of the surface\nare full of rich alluvial soil, and present great facilities for irrigation; but the crests of the ridges are, as a rule, very poor, being made up of sterile gravel lying on a hard subsoil. In R\u0101mgarh the subsoil is light and open, and the surface is composed of a good ferruginous loam, while many of the low hills are coated with a rich dark vegetable mould. The beds of streams are frequently banked up and made into one long narrow rice-field. For other crops than rice the soil receives practically no preparation beyond ploughing. Failures of the crops are due to bad distribution of the rainfall, never to its complete failure: the soil does not retain water for long, and a break of ten days without rain is sufficient to harm the rice crop.\n\nThe agricultural statistics for 1903\u20134 are shown below, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Subdivision | Total | Cultivated | Cultivable waste | Forests |\n|-------------|-------|------------|-----------------|---------|\n| Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh  | 5,019 | 1,616      | 1,266           | 64      |\n| Giridih     | 2,002 | 878        | 595             | 25      |\n| **Total**   | **7,021** | **2,494** | **1,771**       | **89** |\n\nRice is the most important crop. Gor\u0101 or early rice is sown broadcast after the first fall of rain in June, and is reaped about the end of August. Aghani or winter rice is sown in June, and reaped in November or December; it is either sown broadcast or transplanted. After rice by far the most important crops are maize and maru\u0101. Other food-grains are gondli, urd, barai, rahar, kurthi, gram, wheat, barley, and khes\u0101ri; of other food-crops the most important are sugar-cane, mahua, and various vegetables. Oilseeds are extensively grown, consisting chiefly of sarguja, til, rape-seed, and linseed, while among other products may be mentioned poppy, cotton, and renu, a jungle root used for the manufacture of pachwai. A little tea is still grown, but the industry is rapidly dying out; in 1903\u20134 there was only one tea garden, which had an output of 3,700 lb.\n\nThe area under cultivation is gradually being extended by terracing the slopes and embanking the hollows, and by bringing under the plough the tops of ridges. The people have no idea of adopting improved agricultural methods, though they are willing to make use of seed given to them, and cultivators near Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh and Giridih are beginning to grow English vegetables, such as cauliflowers and tomatoes. Loans amounting to Rs. 51,000 were given during the famine of 1897, and Rs. 29,000 was advanced in 1900\u20131 under the Agriculturists' Loans Act in consequence of a failure of the crops. Little advantage has been taken of the Land Improvement Loans Act.\n\nThe breed of cattle is poor. The cattle are ordinarily grazed in\nthe jungles; land is set apart for pasture in villages in which there is no jungle, but the grass is poor, and the cattle get no proper fodder except just after harvest.\n\nThe average irrigated area is estimated at 393 square miles. Irrigation is carried on by means of b\u0101ndhs and \u0101hars, as described in the article on Gay\u0101 District. Well-water is used only for the poppy.\n\nHaz\u0101rib\u0101gh contains 56 square miles of 'reserved,' and 33 square miles of 'protected' forest. The Kodarm\u0101 Reserve, which is the most important forest tract, covers 46 square miles on the scarp of the lower plateau, the elevation varying from about 1,200 feet near Kodarm\u0101 to about 500 feet on the Gay\u0101 boundary. The predominant tree is s\u0101l (Shorea robusta), but there are few trees of any size, most of the larger ones having been cut out before the forest was constituted a Reserve in 1880. Bamboos are scattered throughout the Reserve; and the other principal trees are species of Terminalia, Bauhinia, and Ficus, Bassia latifolia, Sterculia urens, Cassia Fistula, Mangifera indica, Semecarpus Anacardium, Butea frondosa, Lagerstroemia parviflora, Woodfordia floribunda, Eugenia Jamabolana, and Phoenix acaulis. The minor products are thatching-grass, sabai grass (Ischaemum angustifolium), mahu\u0101 flowers (Bassia latifolia), and myrabolams; but none of these is at present of any great importance on account of the distance of the forest from the railway. Owing to excessive grazing and cutting, the 'protected' forests contain no timber of any size. In 1903\u20134 the total forest revenue was Rs. 14,500, of which Rs. 10,000 was derived from the rent for mica mines.\n\nFrom the veins of pegmatite in the gneiss is obtained the mica which has made Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh famous. The pegmatites have the composition of ordinary granite, but the crystals have been developed on such a gigantic scale that the different minerals are easily separable. Besides the mica, quartz, and felspar, which form the bulk of the pegmatite, other minerals of interest, and sometimes of value, are found. Beryl, for instance, is found in large crystals several inches thick; schorl occurs in nearly all the veins; also cassiterite (tin-stone), blue and green tourmaline. Lepidolite and fluor-spar occur near Manimundar (24\u00b0 37\u2032 N., 85\u00b0 52\u2032 E.); columbite, which includes the rare earths tantalum and niobium, exists in one or two places; and apatite, a phosphate of lime, is found in the Lakanandwa mica mine near Kodarm\u0101. Mica in the form of muscovite is the only mineral which has been extracted for commercial purposes. It is worked along a belt which runs from the corner of Gay\u0101 District across the northern part of Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh into Monghyr. Along this belt about 250 mines have been opened. With the exception of Bendi, which is being tested by means of systematic driving and sinking, these are all worked by native methods. The 'books' of mica are of various sizes up\nto 24 by 18 by 10 inches, the more common being about 8 by 4 by 3 inches. The usual practice is to prospect the surface in the rains for these 'books' or indications of them, and then work the shoots or patches during the dry season. The pumping and winding are done by hand. The total output from 238 mines worked in Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh in 1903 was 553 tons, valued at 9\u00bd lakhs. The average number of persons employed daily was 5,878, the average daily wages being for a man 2\u00bd to 4\u00bd annas, for a woman 2 annas, and for a child 1 to 1\u00bd annas.\n\nThe deposit of cassiterite takes a bedded form conformable to the foliation planes of the gneisses and schists in the neighbourhood of Narang\u0101 (24\u00b0 10\u2032 N., 86\u00b0 7\u2032 E.) in the P\u0101lganj estate, 10 miles west of the Giridih coal-field. Unsuccessful attempts were made to work this deposit by a company which ceased operations in 1893, after having carried down an inclined shaft for over 600 feet along the bed of ore. Cassiterite has also occasionally been obtained in mistake for iron ore in washing river sands, and the native iron-smelters have thus obtained tin with iron in their smelting operations. Lead, in the form of a dark red carbonate, has been found at Barhamasia (24\u00b0 20\u2032 N., 86\u00b0 18\u2032 E.) in the north of the District. Similar material has been found in the soil at Mehand\u0101dih (24\u00b0 22\u2032 N., 86\u00b0 20\u2032 E.), Khesmi (24\u00b0 25\u2032 N., 84\u00b0 46\u2032 E.), and Naw\u0101da (24\u00b0 25\u2032 N., 84\u00b0 45\u2032 E.). Argentiferous galena, associated with copper ores and zinc blende, occurs on the Patro river, a mile north-north-east of Gulgo. An unsuccessful attempt was made in 1880 to work these ores. The sulphide of lead, galena, has also been obtained in connexion with the copper ore deposits of B\u0101raganda. A deposit, which has been known since the days of Warren Hastings and has been the subject of many subsequent investigations, occurs near His\u0101tu (23\u00b0 59\u2032 N., 85\u00b0 3\u2032 E.); an analysis of the ore made by Piddington showed the presence of antimony with the lead. The most noteworthy example of copper ores occurs at B\u0101raganda in the P\u0101lganj estate, 24 miles south-west of Giridih. In this area the lead and zinc ores are mixed with copper pyrites, forming a thick lode of low-grade ore which is interbedded with the vertical schists. Shafts reaching a depth of 330 feet were put down to work this lode by a company which commenced operations in 1882, but apparently through faulty management the undertaking was not successful and closed for want of funds in 1891.\n\nLoh\u0101rs and Kols formerly smelted iron in this District, but owing to forest restrictions and the competition of imported English iron and steel, the industry has practically died out. The ore used was principally magnetite derived from the crystalline rocks. Hematite, however, is also obtained from the Barakar stage of the Gondw\u0101na rocks of the Karanpur\u0101 field, and clay ironstone occurs in a higher stage of the D\u0101modar series in the same area.\nThe most conspicuously successful among the attempts to develop the mineral resources is in a little coal-field near Giridih. The small patch of Gondwana rocks, which includes the coal in this field, covers an area of only 11 square miles, and includes $3\\frac{1}{2}$ square miles of the Talcher series, developed in typical form with boulder-beds and needle-shales, underlying sandstones whose age corresponds with the Barakar stage of the D\u0101modar series. The most valuable seam is the Karharb\u0101ri lower seam, which is seldom less than 12 feet in thickness and is uniform in quality, producing the best steam coal raised in India, more than two-thirds of it consisting of fixed carbon. This seam persists over an area of 7 square miles, and has been estimated to contain 113,000,000 tons of coal. The Karharb\u0101ri upper seam is also a good coal, though thinner; and above it lie other seams, of which the Bhaddoah main seam was at one time extensively worked. The total coal resources of this field are probably not less than 124,000,000 tons, of which over 15,000,000 have been raised or destroyed. Like practically all the coal-fields of Bengal, the Gondwana rocks of Giridih are pierced by two classes of trap dikes: thick dikes of basaltic rock, which are probably fissures filled at the time at which the R\u0101jmah\u0101l lava-flows were poured out in Upper Gondwana times; and thin dikes and sheets of a peculiar form of peridotite, remarkable for containing a high percentage of apatite, a phosphate of lime. This rock has done an amount of damage among the coals which cannot easily be estimated, as besides cutting across the coal seams in narrow dikes and coking about its own thickness of coal in both directions, it spreads out occasionally as sheets and ruins the whole or a large section of the seam over considerable areas.\n\nIn this field 9 mines employed in 1903 a daily average of 10,691 hands and had an output of 767,000 tons. The East Indian Railway Company, by whom the bulk of the coal in this field is raised, work it for their own consumption, and have invested 15 lakhs in their mines.\n\nThe miners are of various castes; but Sant\u0101ls and the lower castes of Hindus, such as Bhuiy\u0101s, Mahlis, Gh\u0101tw\u0101ls, Cham\u0101rs, Dos\u0101dhs, and Rajw\u0101rs, predominate. The daily wages paid in the mines worked by the East Indian Railway Company are: for coal-cutters, 6 to 8 annas; horse-drivers underground, 4 annas; women (underground), 3 to 4 annas; fitters, 8 annas to R. 1\u20138\u20130; and for coolies working above ground, men, $2\\frac{1}{2}$ annas to 4 annas; women, $1\\frac{1}{2}$ to 2 annas; and children, $1\\frac{1}{2}$ to $1\\frac{1}{2}$ annas. One shaft, the deepest in India, has a depth of 640 feet, and nearly all the coal is wound by modern plant.\n\nThis is the only field in the District which is regularly worked, but other patches of Gondwana rocks are also coal-bearing. A patch near the village of Itkhori, 25 miles north-west of Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh, includes\nabout half a square mile of the Bar\u0101kar stage lying on a considerable area of T\u0101lchers. There are three seams containing possibly about 2,000,000 tons of inferior coal. The Bok\u0101ro and Karanpur\u0101 fields lie in the low ground of the D\u0101modar river, at the foot of the southern scarp of the Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh plateau. The Bok\u0101ro field commences 2 miles west of the Jherri\u0101 field, and is likely to become important with farther railway extensions. It covers 220 square miles and includes coal seams of large size, one of 88 feet thick being measured. The coal resources of this field are estimated to aggregate 1,500,000,000 tons. In the Karanpur\u0101 area a smaller tract of 72 square miles has been separated from the northern field of 472 square miles through the exposure of the underlying crystalline rocks. There is a large quantity of fuel available in these two fields; in the smaller there must be at least 75,000,000 tons and in the northern 8,750,000,000. In the R\u0101mgarh coal-field to the south of the Bok\u0101ro field the rocks are so faulted that it may not be profitable to mine the coal.\n\nCotton-weaving is carried on by the Jol\u0101h\u0101s, but only the coarsest cloth is turned out. A few cheap wooden toys are made by Khar\u0101dis, and blankets by Gareris, while agricultural implements and cooking utensils are manufactured from locally smelted iron ore.\n\nThe chief imports are food-grains, salt, kerosene oil, cotton twist and European cotton piece-goods; and the chief exports are coal and coke. Of the food-grains, which form the bulk of the imports, rice comes chiefly from M\u0101nbh\u016bm, Burdw\u0101n, and the Sant\u0101l Parganas, wheat from the Punjab and the United Provinces, and gram from Monghyr and Patna; the other imports come from Calcutta. The coal and coke exported by rail in 1903\u20134 amounted to 495,000 tons, of which 86,000 tons went to Calcutta, 195,000 tons to other parts of Bengal, 114,000 tons to the United Provinces, and the remainder to the Punjab, Central Provinces, R\u0101jput\u0101na, and Central India. Minor exports are mica, catechu, sabai grass, lac, mahu\u0101, and hides. Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh, Giridih, and Chatr\u0101 are the principal marts, and form the centres from which imported goods are distributed by petty traders. The bulk of the traffic is carried by the East Indian Railway, which taps the\n\n---\n\n1 'The Giridih Coal-field,' by Saise, in Records, Geological Survey of India, vol. xxvii, part iii (1894); 'The Bok\u0101ro Coal-field and the R\u0101mgarh Coal-field,' by Hughes, in Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. vi, part ii (1867); 'The Karanpur\u0101 Coal-fields,' Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. vii, part iii (1889); 'The Itkhoi Coal-field,' Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. vii, part ii (1872), by Ball; 'The Chope Coal-field,' Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. viii, part ii (1872).\n\nAs regards copper and tin, see 'Geological Notes on N. Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh,' by Mallet, in Records, Geological Survey of India, vol. vii, part i (1874), and 'The Copper and Tin Deposits of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur,' by Oates, in Transactions, Federal Institute of Mining Engineers, vol. ix (1895), p. 427.\nDistrict at Giridih, but a large amount of goods is carried on pack-bullocks and in bullock-carts.\n\nThe only railways at present open are the short branch line connecting Giridih with the East Indian main line at Madhupur, and the Gay\u0101-Katrasgarh line recently constructed, which runs through the north-east of the District. The District board maintained in 1903-4 44 miles of metalled and 521 miles of unmetalled roads, besides 336 miles of village tracks. The most important roads, however, are those maintained by the Public Works department, amounting to 201 miles in length (188 miles metalled and 13 miles unmetalled), and including the grand trunk road, which runs for 78 miles through the District, and the road from Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh to R\u0101nchi, of which 30 miles lie in the District, and the roads from Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh to Barh\u012b and Bagodar and from Giridih to Dunri, the aggregate length of which is 82 miles.\n\nThe District was affected by the famine of 1874. Since then the only severe famine was that of 1897, when distress was general over a broad belt running north and south through the District, the th\u0101ns most affected being Barh\u012b, Kodarm\u0101, Bagodar, Gumia, R\u0101mgarh, M\u0101ndu, and Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh. Relief works were opened but were not largely attended, owing partly to the unwillingness of the wilder tribes to engage in unaccustomed forms of labour, and partly to a fear that the acceptance of famine rates of payment would tend to lower wages permanently; a good deal of employment, however, was afforded by the District board, and gratuitous relief was given to beggars and destitute travellers. The daily average number of persons employed on relief works was highest (1,728) in May, while the number in receipt of gratuitous relief reached its maximum (6,836) in June. The expenditure amounted to Rs. 73,000, including Rs. 26,000 spent on gratuitous relief, and loans were granted to the extent of Rs. 51,000.\n\nFor administrative purposes the District is divided into two subdivisions, with head-quarters at Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh and Giridih. The staff at Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh subordinate to the Deputy-Commissioner consists of three Deputy-Magistrate-Collectors, while the subdivisional officer of Giridih is assisted by a Sub-Deputy-Collector.\n\nThe chief civil court is that of the Judicial Commissioner of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur. The Deputy-Commissioner exercises the powers of a Subordinate Judge, and a Subordinate Judge comes periodically from R\u0101nchi to assist in the disposal of cases. Minor original suits are heard by three Munsifs, sitting at Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh, Chatr\u0101, and Giridih. Rent suits under the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur Tenancy Act are tried by a Deputy-Magistrate-Collector at Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh, by the Munsifs who are\ninvested with the powers of a Deputy-Collector for this purpose, and by\nthe subdivisional officer of Giridih; appeals from their decisions are\nheard by the Deputy-Commissioner or the Judicial Commissioner of\nChot\u0101 N\u0101gpur. Criminal cases are tried by the Deputy-Commissioner,\nthe subdivisional officer of Giridih, and the above-mentioned Deputy\nand Sub-Deputy Magistrates, and by the Munsif of Chatr\u0101, who has\nbeen invested with second-class powers. The Deputy-Commissioner\npossesses special powers under section 34 of the Criminal Procedure\nCode, and the Judicial Commissioner of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur disposes of\nappeals from magistrates of the first class and holds sessions at\nHaz\u0101rib\u0101gh for the trial of cases committed to his court. Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh\nis the least criminal District in Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, and crime is com-\nparatively light.\n\nIn 1835, the first year for which statistics are available, 86 separate\nestates paid a land revenue of Rs. 49,000. The number of estates\nincreased to 244 in 1870\u20131, but after that date a number of the smaller\nestates were amalgamated with others and the total fell in 1903\u20134 to\n157, with a demand of 1\u00b733 lakhs. Of these estates, 72 are perma-\nnently settled, 82 are temporarily settled, and 3 are held direct by\nGovernment.\n\nIn Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh District the eldest son takes the entire estate, and\nprovides for the other members of the family by assigning them smaller\nholdings as maintenance grants. There is thus no tendency to the\nexcessive subdivision of estates which is found in Bih\u0101r. Besides these\nmaintenance grants, j\u0101girs to gh\u0101tav\u0101ls, priests, servants, and others are\ncommon. The only unusual form of j\u0101gir is one known as putra-\nputr\u0101dik, which remains in the family of the grantee until the death of\nthe last direct male heir, after which it reverts to the parent estate.\nThe incidence of revenue is very low, being R. 0\u20131\u20134 per cultivated\nacre, or only 8 per cent. of the rental, which is Rs. 1\u20132\u20136 per cultivated\nacre. The highest rates are realized from rice lands, which are divided\ninto three main classes: gair\u0101, the rich alluvial lands between the\nridges; sing\u0101, the land higher up the slopes; and b\u0101d, the highest land\non which rice can be grown. The rates, which are lowest in the\ncentral plateau and highest in the Sakri valley, vary for gair\u0101 land from\nRs. 3\u201310\u20138 to Rs. 5\u20135\u20134 per acre (average Rs. 4\u20135\u20134); for sing\u0101 land,\nfrom Rs. 2\u201310\u20138 to Rs. 4 (average Rs. 3\u201310\u20138); and for b\u0101d land, from\nRs. 1\u201310\u20138 to Rs. 3\u201310\u20138 (average, Rs. 2\u20132\u20138). Other lands are\nclassified as b\u0101ri or gharb\u0101ri, the well-manured land situated close to\nthe village; bahirb\u0101ri, fairly good land situated farther from the home-\nstead; chir\u0101, land set apart for growing paddy seedlings; t\u0101nr, barren\nland on the tops of the ridges; and tarri or rich land on the banks\nor in the beds of rivers. For these the ryot usually renders predial\nservices in lieu of rent.\nVillage lands are of four kinds. *Manjhahas* is a portion of the best land set apart for the head of the village. It is frequently sublet, sometimes at a cash rent, but more often on the *adhbatai* system, under which each party takes half the produce. When held *kh\u0101s*, it is cultivated by the ryots for the proprietor, the latter supplying the seed and a light meal on the days when the villagers are working for him. *Jiban* is land in which the ryots have occupancy rights. *Khundw\u0101t* or *s\u0101jw\u0101t* lands are those reclaimed from jungle or waste land, and the ryot and his descendants have a right of occupancy, paying rent at half the rate prevailing in the neighbourhood for *jiban* lands. *Utkar* land is that cultivated by tenants-at-will. The rents of *jiban* and *utkar* lands are usually payable in cash, but in the Sakri valley the system of payment by assessment or division of the produce is common.\n\nThe following table shows the collections of land revenue and total revenue (principal heads only), in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 1,16   | 1,25   | 1,31   | 1,34   |\n| Total revenue  | 3,94   | 4,92   | 5,42   | 6,74   |\n\nOutside the municipalities of Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh, Chatr\u0101, and G\u012br\u012bd\u012bh, local affairs are managed by the District board. In 1903-4 its income was Rs. 96,000, including Rs. 50,000 derived from rates; and the expenditure was Rs. 1,01,000, the chief item being Rs. 59,000 spent on public works.\n\nThe District contains 18 police stations or *th\u0101nas*, and 20 outposts. In 1903 the force subordinate to the District Superintendent consisted of 3 inspectors, 33 sub-inspectors, 54 head constables, and 431 constables. The Central jail at Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh has accommodation for 1,257 prisoners, and a subsidiary jail at G\u012br\u012bd\u012bh for 21. The Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh Reformatory school has accommodation for 357 boys.\n\nEducation is very backward, and only 2.6 per cent. of the population (5.2 males and 0.2 females) could read and write in 1901. The number of pupils under instruction increased from 6,234 in 1882-3 to 15,867 in 1892-3, but fell to 14,345 in 1900-1. In 1903-4, 16,440 boys and 2,014 girls were at school, being respectively 19.2 and 2.2 per cent. of the children of school-going age. The various missions maintain schools for the benefit of the aboriginal tribes. The most notable educational institutions are the Dublin University Mission First Arts college, and the Reformatory at Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh. The total number of institutions, public and private, in 1903-4 was 692, including the Arts college, 16 secondary, 643 primary, and 32 special schools. The expenditure on education was Rs. 1,12,000, of which Rs. 38,000 was\nmet from Provincial funds, Rs. 31,000 from District funds, Rs. 800 from municipal funds, and Rs. 23,000 from fees.\n\nIn 1903 the District contained 7 dispensaries, of which 5 had accommodation for 64 in-patients. The cases of 37,411 out-patients and 586 in-patients were treated during the year, and 1,570 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 11,000, of which Rs. 1,200 was met from Government contributions, Rs. 2,000 from Local and Rs. 2,400 from municipal funds, and Rs. 5,000 from subscriptions.\n\nVaccination is compulsory only in the Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh, Giridih, and Chatr\u0101 municipalities. In 1903-4 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 41,000, or 36 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n[Sir W. W. Hunter, Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xvi (1877); F. B. Bradley-Birt, Chota Nagpur (1903).]\n\nHaz\u0101rib\u0101gh Subdivision.\u2014Head-quarters subdivision of Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh District, Bengal, lying between 23\u00b0 25' and 24\u00b0 38' N. and 84\u00b0 27' and 86\u00b0 7' E., with an area of 5,019 square miles. The subdivision consists of three distinct tracts: a high central plateau, a lower plateau extending along the northern boundary, and the valley of the D\u0101modar to the south. The population in 1901 was 760,164, compared with 762,510 in 1891, the density being 151 persons per square mile. There are two towns, Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh (population, 15,799), the head-quarters, and Chatr\u0101 (10,599); and 5,440 villages. The subdivision contains some interesting archaeological remains, consisting of rock temples at M\u0101hudi, Buddhist inscriptions at Kuluh\u0101 Hill, and an old fort at Kund\u0101.\n\nHaz\u0101rib\u0101gh Town.\u2014Head-quarters of Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh District, Bengal, picturesquely situated in 23\u00b0 59' N. and 85\u00b0 22' E., on the high central plateau of the District, at an elevation of 2,000 feet above sea-level, in the midst of a group of conical hills. Population (1901), 15,799. The town is little more than a cluster of hamlets, with intervening cultivation, which sprung up round the former military bazar. Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh has been the head-quarters of the civil administration since 1834. The cantonment lies south-east of the town. The last military force stationed here was the second battalion, 22nd Regiment; but owing to an outbreak of enteric fever in 1874, which resulted in numerous deaths, the troops were withdrawn, with the exception of a small detachment, which was chiefly designed to guard against a possible outbreak of the prisoners in the European penitentiary situated here. Subsequently, on the abolition of the penitentiary, the European troops were entirely withdrawn. Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh was constituted a municipality in 1869. The income during the decade ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 11,600, and the expenditure Rs. 10,800. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 17,000, of which Rs. 5,000 was derived from a tax on persons (or property tax), and Rs. 4,000 from a conservancy\nrate; and the expenditure was Rs. 16,000. The town contains the usual public buildings. The Central jail has accommodation for 1,257 prisoners; the principal articles manufactured are blankets and cloth. The Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh Reformatory school has since 1882 occupied the buildings formerly used for the European penitentiary. It is managed by a board subject to the general control of the Director of Public Instruction, and has cubicle accommodation for 357 boys, who are taught weaving, agriculture, tailoring, gardening, carpentry, shoe-making, and blacksmith's work. The chief educational institution is the Dublin University Mission First Arts college, which was opened in 1899.\n\nHazro.\u2014Town in the District and tahsil of Attock, Punjab, situated in $33^\\circ 55' N.$ and $72^\\circ 30' E.$, in the middle of the Chach plain, $4\\frac{1}{2}$ miles by metalled road from Hathi\u0101n on the grand trunk road, and $7\\frac{1}{2}$ miles from Lawrencepur on the North-Western Railway. Population (1901), 9,799. Hazro is a picturesque town, surrounded by rich cultivation, and has a flourishing trade, chiefly in tobacco and sugar, controlled by a few enterprising Hindus. The municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 18,300, and the expenditure Rs. 17,200. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 19,200, chiefly from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 35,000, including a large investment in securities. An Anglo-vernacular middle school and a dispensary are maintained by the municipality.\n\nHebli.\u2014Town in the District and taluka of Dh\u0101rw\u0101r, Bombay, situated in $15^\\circ 28' N.$ and $75^\\circ 8' E.$, 7 miles east of Dh\u0101rw\u0101r town. Population (1901), 5,294. Hebli is situated on rising ground, with an old dilapidated fort in the centre. A weekly market is held here. Hebli was granted in 1748 by B\u0101l\u0101j\u012b B\u0101j\u012b Rao Peshw\u0101 to an ancestor of the present Sard\u0101r. In 1818 Sir Thomas Munro gave the proprietor the neighbouring villages of Kurd\u0101pur and Talva for services to the British Government. Close to the village are a temple of Shambhuling and a ruined temple of Changalov\u0101dev\u012b. The town contains a boys' school and a girls' school.\n\nHeggadadevankote.\u2014South-western taluk of Mysore District, Mysore State, lying between $11^\\circ 44'$ and $12^\\circ 12'$ N. and $76^\\circ 7'$ and $76^\\circ 31'$ E., with an area of 620 square miles. The population in 1901 was 61,416, compared with 61,226 in 1891. The taluk contains two towns, Sargur (population, 2,284) and Heggadadevankote (1,298), the head-quarters; and 276 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 69,000. The greater part is forest, especially in the west and south, which are bordered by Coorg and the Wynaad. In the K\u0101kan-kote State forest are the principal elephant kheddas. The east is mountainous. The Kabbani flows with a tortuous course from south-west to north-east, where it is joined by the Nugu, which runs through the east. The latter has a dam, but the principal irrigation channel is\nfrom a dam on the Lakshmantirtha in the Hunsur taluk. Red and dark-brown soils are general, and two crops of ragi are often produced in the year. 'Wet' cultivation is limited, partly owing to the unhealthiness of the irrigated tracts. This country was the ancient Punnata, mentioned as Poumnata by Ptolemy, who describes it as containing beryl.\n\nHelmand.\u2014A river of Afghanistan which, with its five principal tributaries\u2014the Kaj or Khud Rud, Tirin, Arghandab, Tarnak, and Arghastan\u2014drains all the south-western portion of the State. The Helmand rises at Hazar Kesh, in an upland valley called Chaj Hazara, on the western slopes of the Pagman range, and runs for 300 miles in a south-westerly direction through the Hazarajat, the least-known tract of Afghanistan, before it passes Girishk, about 80 miles west of Kandahar. In the Hazarajat the Helmand is joined by the Khud Rud, and in this part of its course it is said to flow in a deep, narrow, and frequently rocky valley, with numerous gorges. Lower down it is joined by the Tirin, and about 35 miles south-west of Girishk by the united waters of the Arghandab, Tarnak, and Arghastan at Kala Bist. From this junction the course of the Helmand is still south-west, through an arid desert, for 75 miles, when it turns west to Band-i-Kamal Khan, and then north, finally losing itself in the Seistan Hamun. That the whole of its lower valley was once the seat of a large and prosperous population is evidenced by extensive ruins. At the present day inhabitants are few, and cultivation is carried on only in the vicinity of the river. The soil is highly fertile, and with more care in the distribution of the water cultivation could be largely extended. The eastern tributaries of the Helmand\u2014namely, the Tirin, Arghandab, and Tarnak\u2014are rivers of considerable length; and though their source is not correctly known, it is believed that they rise in the highlands to the west and south-west of Ghazni.\n\nHemavati (also called Yenne-hole).\u2014A river of Mysore and one of the chief tributaries of the Cauvery. It rises in the Western Ghats in the south-west of Kadur District, and runs south-east through the Manjarabad taluk to the Coorg frontier, where, joined by some streams from the west, it turns east. Receiving the Yagachi from the north, it then winds round Hole Narsipur, and runs south to the Cauvery near Yedatore, after a course of over 160 miles. It has ten dams, from which about 145 miles of channels are drawn off, irrigating nearly 10,000 acres. The largest channels are the Srirama devar north channel, 47 miles long, in Hassan District, and the Mandigere, 27 miles long, in Mysore District.\n\nHenery.\u2014Island near the entrance of Bombay harbour, off the mainland of Kolaba District, Bombay. See Underi.\n\nHenzada District (Hinthada).\u2014Northernmost District of the Irra-\nwaddy Division of Lower Burma, lying between $17^\\circ 20'$ and $18^\\circ 31'$ N. and $94^\\circ 48'$ and $95^\\circ 47'$ E., in the plain of the Irrawaddy, with an area of 2,870 square miles. It is irregularly triangular in shape, with its apex in the north at Akauktaung, a spur of the Arakan Yoma, touching the Irrawaddy 24 miles above Myanaung, and its base along the northern edges of Bassein and Ma-ubin. The Irrawaddy forms nearly the whole of its eastern border. Its western boundary is the forest-clad watershed of the Arakan Yoma, running north and south, which separates it from Sandoway and the coast. To the south of the District lie Bassein and Ma-ubin; to the north Prome. The District is in fact, with the exception of one circle in the south-eastern corner, contained between the Irrawaddy on the east and the barrier of the Arakan Yoma on the west. In the latitude of Myanaung the Arakan range exceeds 4,000 feet in altitude, but from this point southwards it rapidly diminishes in height.\n\nPhysical aspects.\n\nFrom the main ridge spurs run eastwards towards the Irrawaddy, one, in the extreme north of the District, ending in a conspicuous bluff about 300 feet in height, and washed at its base by the stream. As the river pursues its southerly course to the sea it bears away from the hills, leaving between its banks and the uplands the vast stretch of paddy-fields, 60 miles broad in the south, which forms one of the main features of the District. The hilly tract in the west, 12 to 20 miles in width, is characterized by steep slopes and dense tree-jungle. All the plains were up to modern times annually inundated by the river, but the greater portion of this area is now protected by an extensive system of embankments. The Irrawaddy, bounding the District on the east, sets in a general south-south-east course, and is navigable at all seasons by the largest river steamers. Numerous streams flow from the Yoma eastwards towards the Irrawaddy; most of them are entirely dry in the hot season, and nearly all are marked by precipitous banks and tortuous channels. During the rains, however, boats can ply on the lower reaches of their courses in the plains. Of these watercourses the Patashin is the only one of importance that joins the Irrawaddy itself, which it does just below Kyangin in the extreme north of the District. The rest drain into the Bassein (or Ngawun) river, which leaves the Irrawaddy about 9 miles above Henzada, and flows in a general south-westerly direction into Bassein District. The entrance, about 300 yards wide, is choked by a sandbank, which rises above the low-water level of the Irrawaddy. In the rains, however, the largest boats can cross this obstruction. Thirteen miles below this point the Bassein river is joined from the west by the Okpo or Kanyin stream, which rises in the Yoma and runs for about 60 miles through the Okpo township. This river is connected with the Irrawaddy by a channel known as the Thanbayadaing creek. A short distance below\nthe mouth of the Kanyin the Bassein river is augmented by the waters of the Nangathu, formed of various streams from the Yoma, which unite and flow eastwards into the delta country.\n\nThe chief lakes are the Nyein-e in the Apyauk circle, the Duya and Eitpyet a few miles from Henzada, and the Tu in the Kanaung township. The last, the largest of the four, is 3 square miles in extent.\n\nThe plain is composed of alluvial deposits, which may be divided into an upper and a lower division. The lower consists of coarse gravels transported from a distance; the upper of a very homogeneous but somewhat arenaceous clay of a yellowish colour. The whole deposit has a southward slope exceeding in steepness that of the present surface. The Arakan Yoma in the west is formed by the Negrais rocks passing up into the Nummulitics. Intrusive rocks, which are mostly serpentine, occur in patches.\n\nLike Tharrawaddy, Henzada differs from the true deltaic areas in having no mangrove swamps or tidal jungles. The main vegetation consists of deciduous forests, similar to those in Pegu District, while bordering the Irrawaddy are open savannah forests, similar to those of Hanthawaddy. The riparian vegetation is of the type in Prom\u00e9. On the upper slopes of the Arakan Yoma are evergreen forests, which have not yet been botanically explored, but probably contain oaks, chestnuts, and species of Dipterocarpus.\n\nTigers, leopards, and elephants are all found, the latter for the most part in the hills to the west. During the rains all of these animals confine themselves for safety to the rising ground; but in the dry season they not infrequently enter the plains, where they destroy cattle or rice according to their nature.\n\nThe cold season is short and mild, but the hot months are not very trying, and the means of the maximum and minimum temperatures registered during 1901 were $88^\\circ$ and $68^\\circ$ respectively. The rains usually begin about the end of May, and cease in the middle of October. They have never been known to fail altogether, but the quality of the crops depends upon the distribution of the monsoon. The annual rainfall averages 75 inches at Henzada town, and decreases, as the dry zone is approached, to 58 inches at Kanaung in the north, where there are occasionally complaints of lack of rain. Henzada is too far north to be in the immediate track of cyclones, but destructive floods occur occasionally, though the embankments have largely removed the possibility of serious inundation.\n\nHenzada or Hinthada derives its name from *hintha*, the Burmanized form of the P\u0101li name for the Br\u0101hmani goose. It formed part of the Talaing kingdom of Pegu which was annexed by Alaungpay\u0101 in 1755, but at no time apparently had it an independent political existence. There was no resistance in the\nDistrict to the British advance on Prome during the first Burmese War. In the second War the Burmese troops, on hearing of the occupation of Prome, left their fortifications at Akauktaung, at the extreme northern corner of the present District, and were defeated in an attempt to cross the river. This position was not occupied, however, by the British, and was in time stockaded by the Burmans, who kept the country disturbed till the cutting up of a patrol under a British officer, Major Gardner, who was killed, led to the occupation of Akauktaung. Meanwhile the southern areas were in a still more disturbed state than the northern, in consequence, mainly, of the disbandment of the Burmese police. The rebels, led by one Nga Myat Tun, a hereditary thugyi, made marauding expeditions into Henzada, Bassein, and Ma-ubin, till they were dispersed at Danubyu in the last-named District. Since then, though crime is always heavy, there have been no serious disturbances. The original Henzada District comprised a portion of the existing District of Ma-ubin and practically the whole of the present Tharawaddy District, and its limits have been altered more than once in the past thirty years.\n\nThe population at the last four enumerations was as follows: (1872) 256,753, (1881) 363,899, (1891) 437,620, and (1901) 484,558. The principal statistics of area and population in 1901 are given in the following table:\n\n| Township     | Area in square miles | Number of | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|--------------|----------------------|-----------|------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|              |                      | Towns.    | Villages.  |                          |                                                          |                                        |\n| Henzada      | 369                  | 1         | 520        | 131,698                   | 357                                                      | + 11                                   | 4,394                                  |\n| Zalun        | 276                  | 1         | 362        | 69,592                    | 252                                                      | + 18                                   | 18,349                                 |\n| Okpo         | 694                  | ...       | 436        | 84,046                    | 121                                                      | + 14                                   | 21,080                                 |\n| Lemyethn\u0101    | 438                  | 1         | 354        | 60,314                    | 138                                                      | + 6                                    | 18,186                                 |\n| Kanaung      | 615                  | 1         | 428        | 92,365                    | 150                                                      | + 16                                   | 23,089                                 |\n| Kyangin      | 478                  | 1         | 243        | 49,633                    | 98                                                       | + 2                                    | 12,200                                 |\n| District total | 2,870               | 5         | 2,343      | 484,558                   | 169                                                      | + 11                                   | 97,298                                 |\n\nHenzada contains more towns than any other District in Burma, the urban population in 1901 being 54,500, which is above 11 per cent. of the total, compared with 7 per cent. for the Irrawaddy Division as a whole. The towns are Henzada, the head-quarters, Zalun, Kyangin, Myanaung, and Lemyethn\u0101. The density of population is very high for Burma. Burmese is the language of 418,000 of the inhabitants, while Karen is spoken by 44,000.\n\nIn 1901 the Burmans numbered 422,800, or 87 per cent. of the District total. The Talaings have become merged with the Burmans,\nand are scarcely represented at all. The Karens in 1901 numbered 45,800. They are distributed all over the District, except in the Kyangin township in the north, and form about one-fourth of the population of the southernmost township, Zalun, and one-seventh of that of Henzada. There are very few Shans, but the Chins on the hills in the west number 3,600, and retain their own language. They are commonest in the two northern townships. Buddhism is the religion of 468,800 persons, including both Chins and Karens; Musalmans number rather more than 3,000, and Hindus exceed 4,000. The immigrants from India come almost entirely from Bengal and Madras. About half the Muhammadans and three-fourths of the Hindus reside in the municipalities. The number of persons dependent upon agriculture in 1901 was 341,600, or 70 per cent. of the total, a figure higher than the Provincial average. Taungra-cutters, or nomadic cultivators, numbered 5,000.\n\nThe number of Christians (8,085) is comparatively large. Of these 8,000 are native Christians, the great majority being Karens. The Roman Catholics have several missionaries at work, mostly among the Karens, and a mission to the Chins at Yenandaung has been started recently. The American Baptists have 48 churches and 42 vernacular schools, and also work mainly among the Karens.\n\nThe flatness of the greater part of the District and its position at the head of the Irrawaddy delta render it an area particularly suitable for rice. The whole of the plain was until recently flooded annually by the Irrawaddy, so that the soil is new alluvium, and the extensive system of protective embankments that has been introduced now shelters large areas under rice. Much land is still flooded, however, in the Okpo township north of the Bassein river, where it flows past the end of the Myanaung embankment; and in the Apyauk circle, on the eastern bank of the Irrawaddy, where it makes a sweeping curve from south-east to south-west. The Bassein river, too, is confined only on its left bank, and inundates a large portion of the Lemyethna township lying west of it. On such lands, and in the low-lying kwins in the Henzada and Zalun townships, rice is sown broadcast, the floods frequently necessitating a second sowing; but over the rest of the District it is transplanted from nurseries after the rains have well set in. In the flooded portions of the Lemyethna township a kind of rice called kaukhnaung is planted as late as October or November; and to ensure a crop the villagers dam one of the streams crossing the plain, and tap it by subsidiary channels so as to make it flow on to the various holdings. The le (plough) is rarely met with, the tundon (which resembles the harrow) being in general use for preparing the ground. Manuring is not uncommon, but as a rule the only fertilization that the land\nreceives is from the annual burning of rice stubble in the fields. A very large area of garden cultivation lies on the Akauktaung hill, along the Patashin and Okpo rivers, on the high lands adjoining Myanaung and overlooking the Tu lake in the Kanaung township, and along the road from Neikban to Aingthabyu in the Henzada township.\n\nThe main agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are shown below, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Township   | Total area | Cultivated | Irrigated | Forests |\n|------------|------------|------------|-----------|---------|\n| Henzada    | 369        | 221        | 0.8       |         |\n| Zalun      | 276        | 124        | 0.1       |         |\n| Okpo       | 694        | 136        |           |         |\n| Lemyethn\u0101  | 438        | 89         | 5.9       | 803     |\n| Kanaung    | 615        | 149        | 0.2       |         |\n| Kyangin    | 478        | 60         |           |         |\n| **Total**  | **2,870**  | **779**    | **7**     | **803** |\n\nRice covered 681 square miles in that year. This is a very considerable advance on the figures for 1881, when only 372 square miles were under rice. The increase has been largely the outcome of elaborate protective works. Henzada grows more tobacco than any other District in Burma, and the area under this crop (17 square miles) is extending yearly. Garden cultivation, including plantains, coco-nuts, pineapples, papayas, mangoes, and jack-fruit, increased from 23 square miles in 1881 to 56 square miles in 1903-4, the largest District total in Burma. Of this area, the orchards of the Henzada and Kanaung townships occupy two-thirds. A total of 4,700 acres, for the most part in the Henzada, Kanaung, and Kyangin townships, is under pulse (*pegyi*), a cold-season crop. Miscellaneous non-food crops are grown on 6,400 acres, for the most part in the Zalun and Henzada townships; and maize, gram, and sesamum cover about 1,000 acres each.\n\nHavana and various kinds of Indian tobacco have been tried, but hitherto without much success. The failure is attributed to the attraction these tobaccos have for insects, and to the necessity for greater care and attention than the ordinary Burmese husbandman is disposed to give to their cultivation. No use is made by the cultivators of the Agriculturists\u2019 Loans Act; they still prefer to have recourse to the local money-lender when in need of ready cash. A co-operative credit society has, however, been recently started at Apyauk under the provisions of Act X of 1904, and has so far worked successfully.\n\nThere are no local breeds of cattle in the District; buffaloes are numerous, but are not by any means as plentiful as kine. Ponies are scarce and of poor quality. Goats are bred almost exclusively\nby Indians. Cattle graze for the most part on the higher land not used for rice cultivation, and, in the dry season, along the river banks. Considerable difficulty is found, however, in the southern townships in providing sufficient grazing grounds for the live-stock.\n\nThe embankments, designed to keep the floods back from the low-lying cultivated levels, are one of the main features of Henzada. The northernmost of these, the Kyangin embankment, on the right bank of the Irrawaddy in the north of the District, was begun in 1864 for the protection of Kyangin town and the paddy-fields behind it, along the line of a small embankment previously built by the Deputy-Commissioner. It is $6\\frac{3}{4}$ miles long, and protects about 3,000 acres. The cost was a lakh and a half, and the net revenue from the land brought under cultivation by the work is less than 2 per cent. on the capital outlay; but the benefit the town derives from it has been, apart from this, sufficient to justify the undertaking.\n\nThe Myanaung embankment is practically a southern continuation of the last-named work, and was constructed about 1868. It extends down the western bank of the Irrawaddy for 39 miles, and protects nearly 100 square miles. It cost 11 lakhs and now yields a steady profit.\n\nThe Henzada embankment, which shelters a further stretch of the western bank of the Irrawaddy, was begun in 1867, along the line of previous constructions made by the villagers or from local funds, and gradually extended southwards across the District border into Ma-ubin. Its construction has cost nearly 19 lakhs. The total length is 76 miles, and the area protected about 340,000 acres, of which 41 miles and 73,000 acres are within Henzada. In 1903\u20134 the net addition to the land revenue that resulted from its construction was 36 per cent. on the capital outlay. Floods in 1868 and 1877 caused widespread destruction of crops, and breaches occurred in 1871 and 1890, but without doing much damage. The embankment has gradually been raised, and since the latter year no serious breach has occurred, though the flood of 1893 was the highest recorded.\n\nThe Ngawun embankment branches off in a south-westerly direction from the northern end of the Henzada embankment into Bassein District. It was constructed between 1869 and 1884. It is 76 miles long, and, with the Henzada embankment, protects about 1,600 square miles. About 39 miles of embankment and about 500 square miles of protected land are within the limits of Henzada.\n\nThere are 176 fresh-water river and lake fisheries in Henzada District, the leases of which are leased annually by auction for a total of rather more than 2 lakhs. None of the individual fisheries is, however, very large. The most valuable realizes between Rs. 12,000 and Rs. 13,000 at the auction sales. A\ngood deal of the fish caught is converted locally into ngapi, and the fishing industry is on the whole flourishing.\n\nThe ten forest Reserves in the District cover an area of 803 square miles, and an additional area of 120 square miles is under settlement. The Reserves are almost entirely in the western part and contain a fair proportion of teak. In the plains the in (Dipterocarpus tuberculatus) grows freely, and cutch is abundant, mostly in the Myanaung subdivision, while pyingado (Xylia dolabriformis) is plentiful at the foot of the hills, and is largely used for house-building. A fire-protection scheme was started in 1900, and will probably be extended throughout the Reserves. The forest receipts in 1903\u20134 were Rs. 64,000.\n\nThe District is poor in minerals. An attempt to work the carbonaceous shale in the Okpo township failed in 1882. Petroleum has been discovered at Yenandaung near Myanaung, but the wells have been abandoned.\n\nTextile industries, largely subsidiary to agriculture, are common throughout the District, but are confined to local requirements. Henzada and Kyangin excel in silk-weaving, and workers in gold, silver, and iron are fairly numerous in the towns. As in the other delta Districts, fish-curing is carried on largely. There are two rice-mills in Henzada town.\n\nRice is exported in large quantities to Rangoon by rail, river steamers, and country boats for transhipment to foreign ports, and is also sent by river to Upper Burma in steamers. Other exports to Rangoon are betel-leaves, plantains, sugar-cane, and hides. The principal imports are cotton and silk piece-goods, umbrellas, china-ware, and other articles of European manufacture. Till recently they entered the District almost wholly by river; of late, however, the railway has begun to bring them.\n\nA steam ferry crosses the Irrawaddy between Henzada and Tharrawaw, a village in Tharrawaddy District on the opposite bank, 103 miles by rail from Rangoon. The railway from Henzada to Bassein (81 miles in length) runs south-westwards through the southern part of the District for a distance of 16 miles, with stations at Henzada, Natmaw, and Neikban. This line was opened in 1903, and a second line from Henzada northwards, through Okpo and Myanaung to Kyangin, is under construction. Henzada is a station of call for the mail and cargo steamers of the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company plying between Rangoon and Mandalay, and in addition enjoys regular direct communication with Rangoon. In the rains launches run on the Bassein creek to Bassein and intermediate places, and for a few months in the year there is steam traffic between Henzada and Okpo on the Thanbayadaing. The Irrawaddy is navigable throughout the year by large boats and river steamers, which call at all the principal stations.\nalong the banks. During the floods caused by the rains the sole inter-\nvillage communication in the interior of the District is by boat. Roads\nare used only during the dry season. About 320 miles of road are\nmaintained from Provincial funds, of which 30\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) miles are metalled\nand 289 unmetalled. The District cess fund keeps up seven roads,\n38 miles metalled and 30 miles unmetalled. The most important\nhighways are from Henzada to Myanaung (64 miles), and from Henzada\nto Shage (20 miles). Alongside the embankments run roads from\nNgawun to Myenu (25 miles), Ngawun to Nyaunggyaung (52 miles),\nand Myanaung to Ingauk (39 miles).\n\nThe District is divided into two subdivisions: Henzada, consisting\nof the Henzada, Zalun, Okpo, and Lemyethn\u0101 townships; and\nMyanaung, consisting of the Kanaung and Kyan-\ngin townships. As in other parts of Lower Burma,\nthe circle thugyi is being gradually abolished as deaths or resignations\noccur, the village headman (yivathugyi) taking his place. Village head-\nmen now number 621. The District forms two subdivisions (Henzada\nand Myanaung) of the Henzada Public Works division. For forest\npurposes it constitutes part of the Myanaung subdivision of the\nHenzada-Thongwa Forest division.\n\nLitigation has largely increased of late years, and the Deputy-Com-\nmissioner has recently been relieved of civil work by a District Judge\nwith head-quarters at Bassein, who presides over the Bassein and\nHenzada District courts. The subdivisional courts are presided over\nby the subdivisional officers concerned, and the township courts of\nHenzada and Kanaung by a special township judge who sits at\nHenzada, while at Okpo and Lemyethn\u0101 township judges have relieved\nthe township officers of civil business. Sessions cases are tried by the\nJudge of the Bassein Division. The magistrates\u2019 courts are presided\nover by the appropriate executive officers in the usual way, but the\ntownship magistrates of Henzada, Lemyethn\u0101, and Okpo have the\nassistance of the township judges in disposing of their criminal work.\nThe crime of the District does not differ from that prevalent throughout\nthe Irrawaddy Division, and, as elsewhere in the delta, criminal work\nis heavy. Dacoities, at one time very common, have decreased within\nthe last few years; but robberies, thefts, and grievous hurt cases are\nstill numerous.\n\nAt annexation, in 1852, the revenue paid by the District into the\ncoffers of the king of Burma was slightly over 2 lakhs, though much\nmore than this must no doubt have been collected. The chief items\nwere the house-family tax, a tax on land per yoke of oxen, and one\non fisheries. Taxes on brokers and transit dues also existed, but\nthese were abolished and excise duties levied in their place after the\nBritish occupation.\nThe greater part of the cultivated lands from the Irrawaddy to the foot of the Arakan Yoma was brought under settlement between 1862 and 1868, when rates varying from 12 annas (on the remote interior kwin) to Rs. 1-12-0 were levied on each acre of rice land. In 1873-4 a revision of rates took place in the Kyangin township and the northern circles of the Kanaung township, and the rates in this area were raised to R. 1 or Rs. 1-10-0 per acre on rice land, while the rate on gardens, which as a general rule was Rs. 1-12-0, was changed to one varying from Rs. 1-8-0 to Rs. 2. At the same time an enhancement was effected in the Henzada township, which raised the maximum from Rs. 1-12-0 to Rs. 2. In 1879-80 a general raising of assessment took place all over the District, ranging from 15 to 25 per cent. The rates prevailing after this enhancement varied from Rs. 1-4-0 to Rs. 2-2-0 on rice land, but the maximum on gardens continued to be Rs. 2. Resettlement operations were undertaken throughout the District in 1883-6, when rates were introduced varying from 12 annas to Rs. 2-8-0 for rice, and from Rs. 2 to Rs. 2-8-0 for gardens. In 1899-1901 the whole cultivated area of the District (except a portion referred to later) was regularly resettled. The new rates vary from 12 annas to Rs. 4 on rice lands, with uniform assessments of Rs. 3 on gardens, Rs. 2 on mayin rice, Rs. 2-8-0 on tobacco and miscellaneous cultivation, and Rs. 10 on betel-vines. The interior of the three northern townships at the foot of the Yoma, where cultivation occurs only in patches, was not touched in the settlement operations in 1885-6, and this tract (averaging about 8 miles in width) was resettled in 1900-1. The following rates were then introduced and are still enforced: on kaikkyi rice lands, R. 1 to Rs. 3; on mayin rice lands, Rs. 2; on gardens, Rs. 2 and Rs. 3; and on miscellaneous cultivation, Rs. 1-8-0 to Rs. 2-8-0.\n\nThe steady growth of the revenue in the past may be gathered from the following table, which shows land revenue and total revenue, in thousands of rupees, since 1880-1:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 4,62   | 6,92   | 8,45   | 12,40  |\n| Total revenue  | 10,76  | 13,57  | 16,24  | 25,23  |\n\nThe total revenue for 1903-4 includes Rs. 4,49,000 from capitation tax, Rs. 2,04,000 from fisheries, and Rs. 3,22,000 from excise.\n\nThe District cess fund is maintained chiefly by a levy of 10 per cent. on the total land revenue, and is administered by the Deputy-Commissioner for the provision of various local needs. The income in 1903-4 was 1.43 lakhs, and the chief items of expenditure were public works (Rs. 42,000) and education (Rs. 27,000).\nThere are four municipalities, Henzada, Zalun, Kyangin, and Myanaung; and one town under a town committee, Lemyethna.\n\nThe District Superintendent of police is aided by two Assistant Superintendents in charge of the two subdivisions; and the force comprises 4 inspectors, 10 head constables, 33 sergeants, and 301 constables. Fifteen village headmen are on the paid staff of the rural police. The District contains 15 police stations and one outpost. The military police has a strength of 3 native officers and 187 rank and file. Of these, 76 are stationed at Henzada, and 39 at Myanaung, the rest being distributed at the different township head-quarters. The District contains two jails, one at Henzada and one at Myanaung. The first has accommodation for 521 prisoners, who work at rice cultivation, brick making, carpentry, and cane-work. The second is designed to hold 88 prisoners, and its inmates are engaged in gardening and basket-work.\n\nThe percentage of literate persons in 1901 was 26 (47\u00b76 males, and 5\u00b74 females). The increase of education in the District since 1880 can be gauged from the number of pupils: (1880-1) 5,446, (1890-1) 6,712, and (1900-1) 14,252. In 1903-4 there were 2 special, 18 secondary, 272 primary, and 502 elementary (private) schools, with 12,979 boys and 2,472 girls. The total expenditure on education was Rs. 65,800, which was met from the following sources: municipal funds (Rs. 13,300), District cess (Rs. 27,000), Provincial funds (Rs. 8,600), and fees (Rs. 16,300).\n\nThere are 5 hospitals and a dispensary, with accommodation for 68 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 52,113, including 1,008 in-patients, and 802 operations were performed. The total expenditure was Rs. 19,200, towards which municipal funds contributed Rs. 14,800, Local funds Rs. 3,600, and subscriptions Rs. 800.\n\nVaccination is compulsory only within municipal limits. In 1903-4 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 39,772, representing 82 per 1,000 of population.\n\n[J. Mackenna, Settlement Reports (1901 and 1902); B. Samuelson, History of Embankments, Henzada Division (1889).]\n\nHenzada Subdivision.\u2014Southern portion of Henzada District, Lower Burma, occupying about two-thirds of the whole, and comprising the Henzada, Zalun, Okpo, and Lemyethna townships.\n\nHenzada Township.\u2014Township in Henzada District, Lower Burma, lying between 17\u00b0 24' and 17\u00b0 50' N. and 95\u00b0 12' and 95\u00b0 33' E., with an area of 369 square miles. It lies between the Irrawaddy and the Ngawun, and is a level plain, almost entirely protected by embankments, the Hleseik circle, surrounding the mouth of the latter river, alone being liable to inundation. The population in 1901 was 131,698, compared with 118,839 in 1891. Except in Henzada town,\nthere are very few natives of India. The Karens in 1901 numbered 16,000, and the majority of the rest of the population is Burman. The density outside municipal limits is high for Burma, being 291 persons per square mile. The township contains 520 villages and one town, Henzada (population, 24,756), the township and District headquarters. The area cultivated in 1903-4 was 221 square miles, paying Rs. 3,80,000 land revenue.\n\nHenzada Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the District of the same name in Lower Burma, situated in 17\u00b0 39' N. and 95\u00b0 30' E., on the western bank of the Irrawaddy, 9 miles below the bifurcation of the Bassein river, and 110 miles by rail from Rangoon. Henzada is said to have been founded early in the sixteenth century; but, although it has been an important town for a long time, its history is uneventful. The population has increased steadily during the last thirty years, the total in 1901 being 24,756, of whom 21,530 were Buddhists, 2,145 Hindus, and 742 Musalmans. The Hindus have largely increased during the past decade, but the Musalmans show a falling off. The town is agreeably situated, is well shaded by fine trees, and contains a large courthouse, a jail, an extensive bazar near the steamer gh\u0101t, a hospital and other public buildings, all at no great distance from the river bank. Henzada is a trade centre of some importance. Till recently its commerce has been wholly river-borne, but the new Rangoon-Bassein railway which passes through the town will probably alter the route of a good deal of the trade. It is the terminus of the western (Henzada-Bassein) section of the railway, and the Henzada station is connected by a steam ferry with Tharrawaw, the terminus of the eastern section on the farther side of the Irrawaddy. Two rice-mills and one saw-mill of recent construction are worked in the town, and milled rice is sent to Upper Burma by boat and to Rangoon by both rail and boat. This is the only export of importance. The town was constituted a municipality in 1874. The municipal income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 72,000 and Rs. 70,000 respectively. In 1903-4 the totals were 1.2 lakhs and 1.1 lakhs. The principal sources of income in the last-named year were the house tax (Rs. 14,000), market dues (Rs. 46,000), and the conservancy tax (Rs. 8,000); and the principal items of expenditure were conservancy (Rs. 15,500), roads (Rs. 34,000), and hospital (Rs. 11,000). A municipal Anglo-veracular school has 180 pupils, and other teaching institutions are managed by missionary bodies and others. The educational expenditure of the municipality in 1903-4 was Rs. 7,000. The municipal hospital has accommodation for 28 in-patients.\n\nHer\u0101t Province.\u2014Western province of Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, bounded on the north by Russian territory; on the west by Persia; on the south by the province of Kandah\u0101r; on the east by Afgh\u0101n-Turkist\u0101n and by\nthe province of K\u0101bul, from which it is divided by the watershed between the Farrah R\u016bd and Helmand basins. The province is drained by the Murgh\u0101b, the Hari Rud, the Adr\u0101skan, and the upper affluents of the Farrah R\u016bd. On the east lie the Haz\u0101ra mountains, on the west the Khor\u0101s\u0101n deserts. On the south the country is open; and the great trade routes from Kandah\u0101r to Seist\u0101n lead through the broad space between the Taimani hills and the Persian deserts.\n\nThe most populous and fertile part of the province is that comprised in the districts of Her\u0101t, Ghori\u0101n, Obeh, and Karokh. North of this fertile tract is the Si\u0101h B\u016bbak range, known to the Greeks as the Paropamisus, a prolongation of the middle branch of the Koh-i-B\u0101ba. North of Her\u0101t city, and east, the hills are of some height, the peaks rising to 4,000 or 5,000 feet above the valley. North again of the Si\u0101h B\u016bbak is the district of B\u0101dghis, for the most part an expanse of rolling downs, becoming more mountainous towards the east. East of the Her\u0101t valley and B\u0101dghis is a wild mountainous country, inhabited by Firoz Kohis and Taimanis, with a few Haz\u0101ras. This is a region of barren, rugged mountains, whose peaks rise to 10,000 and 12,000 feet. Here are the three branches of the Koh-i-B\u0101ba, the northern known as the Band-i-Turkist\u0101n; the central as the Si\u0101h B\u016bbak or Koh Si\u0101h; and the southern as the Band-i-Bai\u0101n or Safed Koh. Between the two first is the country of the Firoz Kohis; between the two last is the Hari Rud valley, which is also occupied in the upper part by Firoz Kohis; and south of the Band-i-Bai\u0101n is the Taimani country. South of Her\u0101t city lies the open country of the Sabzawar district.\n\nThe province is divided into the following administrative divisions, the sub-governors of which are subordinate to the governor of Her\u0101t: the city of Her\u0101t, with the Nan Bul\u0101k; Ghori\u0101n; Sabzawar; Karrukh; Obeh; Subah-i-Sarhaddi, including all the minor districts north of the Koh Si\u0101h; \u010cakchar\u0101n; Shah\u0101rak; and Ghor\u0101t. The population of the whole province has been estimated at about half a million. The great majority are Her\u0101tis, i.e. Persian-speaking people of Ir\u0101nian origin; but large numbers of Afgh\u0101ns (Durr\u0101nis, Ghilzais, and K\u0101kars) have during the last twenty years been settled on the northern frontier. Chah\u0101r Aim\u0101k is a collective name given to the Jamshedis, Firoz Kohis, Taim\u016bris, and Taimanis. They number about 180,000. The Jamshedis and Firoz Kohis are of Persian origin. The Taimanis are also in the main of Persian stock, differing from the others in that they have a strong section, to which the chief belongs, of Afgh\u0101n-K\u0101kar descent. The Kila Nao Haz\u0101ras are descended from fragments of various Haz\u0101ra clans removed to their present lands by N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h. All are semi-nomadic in habit, and all speak dialects of Persian.\n\nFor history and trade see Her\u0101t City.\n\nHer\u0101t City.\u2014Capital of the province of the same name in Afgh\u0101n-\nist\u0101n, situated in $34^\\circ 22' N.$ and $62^\\circ 9' E.$, in a fertile and well-watered valley, about 3 miles from the right bank of the Hari R\u016bd, 407 miles from Kandah\u0101r via Farrah and Sabzawar, and 469 from K\u0101bul; 3,026 feet above the sea. The plain surrounding the city is closely studded with villages, especially on the south, east, and west. These villages are, as a rule, large and straggling, with walled gardens and orchards. The fortifications and ditch are kept in excellent order, and a strong Afgh\u0101n force is always maintained within the walls. The city, nearly square in plan, has five gates, two on the north face, and one on each of the others. There are four bazars meeting under a domed structure, called the Ch\u0101rsu, at the cross-roads in the centre of the city. Near the Ch\u0101rsu the shops are apparently rich and flourishing; but the farther away from it, the more squalid and poor they become. Beyond the four main thoroughfares of bazars, there are no roads properly so called. The interior of the city is a crowded mass of small domed hovels, built of mud or sun-dried bricks, and intersected by narrow alleys, many of them arched over. The only pieces of open ground in the city, and these of small dimensions, are the space around the governor\u2019s house, the gun park, the barracks, and an open square near one of the gates on the north face. The principal buildings are the J\u0101ma Masjid and the Ark-i-Nao, or \u2018new citadel.\u2019 The latter is of comparatively recent construction; the former was built at the end of the fifteenth century in the reign of Sh\u0101h Husain. Originally a splendid edifice, 465 feet by 275, and adorned with gilding, carving, mosaics, &c., it is now much out of repair.\n\nThe total population of Her\u0101t, exclusive of the garrison, is probably between 10,000 and 14,000. There are said to be over 1,300 shops in the city, representing 53 different trades and occupations, and giving employment to 3,500 persons. It is an important centre for the trade of the outlying districts. The principal exports are wool, silk, pistachios, opium, asafoetida, sheepskins, and astrachans; the principal British imports are indigo, tea, sugar, cotton cloth, muslin, drugs, and porcelain goods. Of recent years, Russian goods\u2014chintzes, silk and cotton cloth, certain kinds of broadcloth, hardware, and sugar\u2014have commenced to obtain a footing in the Her\u0101t market.\n\nHer\u0101t, the foundation of which, as Alexandria Arion, is ascribed to Alexander the Great, is not only the capital of a province, but has a strategical value and historical reputation which have given to its possession a moral influence out of all proportion to its present importance whether as a city or as a fortress. It enjoys the pre-eminence of having stood more sieges, and having been depopulated and destroyed more often, than almost any other city in Central Asia. It has invariably risen from its ruins, if not always with renewed splendour, at all events with a vigour that is without parallel. After\nAlexander's death Her\u0101t passed successively under the domination of the Seleucids, the Parthians, and the Sassanids; and on the extinction of their empire it was captured (661) by the Arabs, under whom it became one of the great cities of the Muhammadan world. After the break-up of the Khalfat it fell in turn to the Persian dynasties of the Saffarids and S\u0101m\u0101nids, to the Ghaznivids and to the house of Ghor, and to the Khw\u0101rizm Sh\u0101hs. Then came the Mongol conquest, after which the Karts, an offshoot of the Ghorids, established a local dynasty (1245-1389) which was overthrown by Tim\u016br Lang. From his descendants it passed to the Safavid kings of Persia, and on their decline was for a short time held by the Durr\u0101nis. Regained for Persia by N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h in 1739, it was added in 1751 to the Durr\u0101ni kingdom of Ahmad Sh\u0101h, and on the dissolution of that kingdom became an independent principality under his great-grandson K\u0101mr\u0101n. In 1823, while K\u0101mr\u0101n was in power, the Persians attacked Her\u0101t and were defeated. In 1837 they renewed the attack with 35,000 men; but after a siege which lasted for ten months, and which was only unsuccessful owing to the splendid services of Lieutenant Eldred Pottinger, who had arrived from K\u0101bul just before it commenced, they were compelled to retire, on the appearance of Colonel Stoddart with power to threaten the Sh\u0101h with the hostile intervention of Great Britain. After the retirement of the Persian army, the British Government proclaimed the independence of Her\u0101t under Sh\u0101h K\u0101mr\u0101n, and a treaty was concluded with the latter in 1839 whereby his independence was guaranteed. Sh\u0101h K\u0101mr\u0101n's all-powerful Wazir, Y\u0101r Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, objected to concede the terms which the British demanded in return for the guarantee, and commenced to intrigue with Persia. Early in 1842 he murdered his master and usurped the government. Under his vigorous rule Her\u0101t began to prosper, but he died in 1851 and was succeeded by a son who proved to be imbecile and profligate. The latter was ousted soon afterwards by Mu\u1e25ammad Y\u016bsuf Kh\u0101n Sadozai, his cousin. Early in 1856 the Sh\u0101h of Persia again sent an army to Her\u0101t; but though Mu\u1e25ammad Y\u016bsuf Kh\u0101n was Persian at heart, the people expelled the Persian advance guard and hoisted British colours. Mu\u1e25ammad Y\u016bsuf was sent to the Persian camp, the people rallying round Isa Kh\u0101n, who wrote to the Am\u012br Dost Mu\u1e25ammad, declaring himself a servant of the K\u0101bul government and inviting the Am\u012br to march on Her\u0101t. He was, however, unable to hold out, and in October Her\u0101t surrendered to the Persians. At the close of the war between Great Britain and Persia in March, 1857, the Sh\u0101h withdrew his forces from Her\u0101t, having first installed Sultan Ahmad Kh\u0101n as ruler of the province. In 1861 a quarrel arose between Sultan Ahmad and Am\u012br Dost Mu\u1e25ammad; the latter advanced on Her\u0101t in the following\nyear; and after a siege of ten months, during which Sult\u0101n Ahmad died, the fort fell into his hands. Since then Her\u0101t has remained subject to the Am\u012brs of Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n.\n\n**Hijili Tidal Canal.**\u2014Navigable canal in Midnapore District, Bengal, with a length of 29 miles, extending from Geonkh\u0101li at the junction of the R\u016bp\u1e47\u0101r\u0101yan and Hooghly rivers to the Ras\u016blpur river, whence the Orissa Coast Canal forms a continuation to the southwest. It is divided into two ranges by the Haldi river, and was commenced in 1868 and completed in 1873. The estimated value of the goods carried in 1902\u20133 was 39\u00b72 lakhs, and the net revenue was Rs. 5,000, representing a return of 0\u00b72 per cent. on the capital expenditure. In 1903\u20134 the total receipts amounted to Rs. 42,000 and there was a net revenue of Rs. 17,000; while the capital account stood at 26\u00b715 lakhs on March 31, 1904.\n\n**Hijili Village.**\u2014Name of an old village in Midnapore District, Bengal, situated at the mouth of the Ras\u016blpur river. The site has long since been washed away. Hijili was formerly the centre of an extensive salt manufacture, and the Muhammadans had a fort here. A mosque was built by Masnad Ali Sh\u0101h, who held the neighbouring district from 1505 to 1546, and whose tomb is still visited by pilgrims. In 1687, after the skirmish at Hooghly, Job Charnock occupied Hijili on behalf of the East India Company and was besieged there for four months by a strong Mughal force. Eventually the Muhammadans raised the siege, whereupon Charnock evacuated the place and shortly afterwards laid the foundation of Calcutta. The name of Hijili was also given to a littoral tract of 1,014 square miles, extending along the right bank of the Hooghly river from the confluence of the R\u016bp\u1e47\u0101r\u0101yan to that of the Subarnarekh\u0101, and lying between 21\u00b0 47\u2032 and 21\u00b0 53\u2032 N. and 87\u00b0 53\u2032 and 87\u00b0 59\u2032 E.; it contained among others the two large parganas of Taml\u00fck and Mahish\u0101dal, and, under Muhammadan rule, constituted a separate administration. In 1836 it was included in Midnapore District, with the exception of a small tract in the south which was added to the adjoining District of Balasore. Salt manufacture was discontinued about forty years ago owing to the competition of cheaper Liverpool salt.\n\n[For an account of the siege of Hijili, see C. R. Wilson, *Early Annals of the English in Bengal* (1895), pp. 103\u201311.]\n\n**Hilli.**\u2014Village in Bogra District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 25\u00b0 17\u2032 N. and 89\u00b0 1\u2032 E., on the old Jamun\u0101 river and on the northern section of the Eastern Bengal State Railway. Population (1901), 1,047. It is a large rice and jute mart, goods being transported by both river and railway.\n\n**Hill Tippera** (*Tripura*).\u2014Native State in Eastern Bengal and\nAssam, lying between $22^\\circ 56'$ and $24^\\circ 32'$ N. and $91^\\circ 10'$ and $92^\\circ 22'$ E., with an area of 4,086 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the District of Sylhet; on the west by Tippera District and No\u0101kh\u0101li; on the south by No\u0101kh\u0101li, Chittagong, and the Chittagong Hill Tracts; and on the east by the Lushai Hills and the Chittagong Hill Tracts.\n\nThe lie of the country is similar to that of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Six principal ranges of hills, increasing in height towards the east, run north and south, with an average interval of 12 miles. The hills are clothed for the most part with bamboo jungle, while the low ground is well timbered and covered with cane-brakes and thatching-grass. Along the north-western and southern boundaries of the State lies a narrow strip of low land, differing in no material respect as regards soil, agriculture, and population from the adjoining portions of Sylhet, Tippera, No\u0101kh\u0101li, and Chittagong Districts. Along the western border, for some miles to the north and south of the capital, the country may be described as broken ground, consisting of hillocks alternating with marshy valleys. These hillocks are utilized as sites for homesteads, and the valleys have been converted into rice-fields.\n\nThe principal hill ranges, beginning from the east, are the J\u0101mpai (highest points, Betling Sib, 3,200 feet, and Jampai, 1,860 feet), Sakhtlang (highest point, Sakhan, 2,578 feet), Langtarai (highest point, Phengpu\u012b, 1,581 feet), and Ath\u0101ramura (highest points, J\u0101rimura, 1,500 feet, and Ath\u0101ramura, 1,431 feet). These hills form a watershed from which the drainage pours down north by the Khowai, Dolai, Manu, J\u016bri, and Langai, west into the Meghn\u0101 by the Gumti, and south-west into the Bay of Bengal by the Fenny and Muhari. All of these rivers are navigable by boats of 4 tons burden during the rains, and by boats of 2 tons burden in the dry season. The Muhari, with its tributary the Seloni\u0101, and the Fenny are tidal rivers. Near the source of the Gumti is a waterfall, known as the Dumbura fall; the scenery in its neighbourhood is exceedingly picturesque.\n\nSo far as is known, the rock formation is Upper Tertiary; the plains are covered by recent alluvial deposits. The hills are clothed, in the south, with a forest very similar in appearance and composition to that of Chittagong; and Laurineae, Dipterocarpaceae, Ternstroemiaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Leguminosae are well represented. The north is drier and densely covered by bamboo jungle. The thick forests which clothe the hills shelter wild elephants, rhinoceros, tigers, and bears; pythons are common and are eaten by the Lushais.\n\nThe climate is healthy and the temperature moderate. The annual rainfall averages 76 inches, of which 5 inches fall in April, 11 in May, 15 in June, 12 in July, 11 in August, and 10 in September. The\nearthquake of 1897 destroyed many buildings and shrines in Agartal\u0101, and raised the beds of several rivers, notably of the Manu.\n\nThe origin of the name Tripur\u0101 is uncertain. A mythical account of the ancient history of the State is contained in the R\u0101jm\u0101la, or Chronicles of the Kings, which was commenced in the fifteenth century; it was written in Bengali verse by Br\u0101hman pandits attached to the court. The R\u0101j\u0101 claims descent from Druhyu, son of Yay\u0101ti, of the Lunar race. The chief points of interest contained in these chronicles are that the State was ever at feud with its neighbours, and that Siva worship took early root and was associated with the practice of human sacrifice. The ancient kingdom of Tippera at various times extended its rule from the Sundarbans in the west to Burma in the east, and northwards as far as K\u0101mr\u016bp. The State was first overrun by the Muhammadans under Tughril in 1279, and was again invaded by Ily\u0101s Sh\u0101h in the middle of the fourteenth century, and by Naw\u0101b Fateh Jang in 1620. The plains portion (the present District of Tippera) was not, however, annexed to the Mughal empire until 1733. Hill Tippera proper was never assessed to revenue and remained outside the sphere of Muhammadan administration, although influence was usually exercised in the appointment of the R\u0101j\u0101s. The military prestige of the Tippera R\u0101j\u0101s was at its height during the sixteenth century, when Bijoy M\u0101nikhya defeated the Muhammadan troops who defended Chittagong, and occupied parts of Sylhet and No\u0101kh\u0101li.\n\nAfter the East India Company obtained the d\u012bw\u0101ni of Bengal in 1765 they placed a R\u0101j\u0101 on the throne, and since 1808 each successive ruler has received investiture from the Government. In 1838 it was held by the Deputy-Governor of Bengal that, owing to his unchallenged possession from at least 1793, the R\u0101j\u0101 had obtained a prescriptive right to the territory within the hills. Between 1826 and 1862 the eastern portion of the State was constantly disturbed by Kuki raids, in which villages were burned and plundered, and the peaceful inhabitants massacred. An account of the action taken by the British Government to put an end to these raids will be found in the article on the Lushai Hills.\n\nThe present chief is R\u0101j\u0101 R\u0101dh\u0101 Kishore Deb Barman M\u0101nikhya, who was invested in 1897. The title of M\u0101nikhya, which is still borne by the R\u0101j\u0101s, was bestowed first on R\u0101j\u0101 Ratnaph\u0101, by the king of Gaur, about 1279. The R\u0101j\u0101 receives a salute of 13 guns.\n\nBoth as regards its constitution and its relations with the British Government, the State of Hill Tippera differs alike from the large Native States of India, and from those which are classed as tributary. Besides being the ruler of Hill Tippera, the R\u0101j\u0101 also holds a large landed property called Ch\u0101kla Roshn\u0101bad, situated in\nthe plains of the Districts of Tippera, No\u0101kh\u0101li, and Sylhet. This estate covers an area of 570 square miles, and is the most valuable portion of the R\u0101j\u0101\u2019s possessions; it yields a larger revenue than the whole of Hill Tippera, and it is held to form with the State an indivisible R\u0101j. Disputes as to the right of succession have occurred on the occasion of almost every vacancy in the R\u0101j, producing in times gone by disturbances and domestic wars, and exposing the inhabitants of the hills to serious disorders and attacks from the K\u016bkis, who were always called in as auxiliaries by one or other of the contending parties. The principles which govern succession to the State have recently, however, been embodied in a sanad which was drawn up in 1904. This lays down that the chiefship is hereditary in the Deb Barman family, and that the chief may nominate any male member of his family descended through males from him or any of his male ancestors to be his Jubr\u0101j or successor. Should the ruling chief die without nominating his successor, his nearest male descendant through males according to the rule of lineal primogeniture is to succeed to the chiefship, and failing such descendant, his nearest male heir descended from any male ancestor of his. Finally, every succession to the chiefship requires as heretofore the recognition of the Government of India.\n\nIn 1871 an English officer was first appointed as Political Agent to protect British interests and to advise the R\u0101j\u0101. In 1878 his post was abolished, and the Magistrate of the adjoining District of Tippera was appointed ex-officio Political Agent of Hill Tippera, a Bengali deputy-magistrate being stationed at Agartal\u0101 as Assistant Political Agent; ultimately, in 1890 this latter post was abolished.\n\nThe population in 1901 was 173,325, which gives a density of 42 persons to the square mile; the hills can support only a scanty population. The people live in one town, Agartal\u0101, and 1,463 villages. The recorded population increased from 35,262 in 1872 to 95,637 in 1881, and to 137,442 in 1891; but the first two enumerations were probably inaccurate. The increase of 26 per cent. in 1901 was due mainly to the growing immigration from the neighbouring Districts, 44,000 immigrants having been enumerated in 1901. The same reason explains the deficiency of females, there being only 874 to every 1,000 males. Of the population 44 per cent. speak Tippera or Mrung, a dialect of the Bodo family, of which K\u0101ch\u0101ri and G\u0101ro are the other most important representatives, and 40 per cent. Bengali; many of the remainder speak languages of the K\u016bki-Chin group, such as Manipuri and Hall\u0101m. Hindus form 69 per cent. of the inhabitants, Musalm\u0101ns 26 per cent., Buddhists 3 per cent., and Animists less than 2 per cent.\n\nThe Tipperas are a Mongolian race, and appear to be identical with\nthe Murungs of Arakan. Outside the State and Tippera District they are found in large numbers only in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. In Hill Tippera they number 76,000, and are divided into Pur\u0101n or original Tipperas, and J\u0101m\u0101tias, the fighting caste. There are two other divisions which are not regarded as true Tipperas: the Naw\u0101t\u012bas, who are said to have come from Chittagong; and the Riy\u0101ngs, who are of K\u016bki origin and were formerly the p\u0101lk\u012b-bearers of the Tippera R\u0101j\u0101s. Although the religion of the tribe is returned as Hindu, it is a curious mixture of Hinduism and Animism; the old tribal gods have not yet been ousted, and they are worshipped side by side with those of the Hindus by tribal priests called Ojh\u0101s. A list of the deities worshipped will be found on pp. 186 and 187 of the Census Report, 1901. The family gods of the Tippera kings are known as the chaudah devat\u0101, or \u2018fourteen gods\u2019; and they include Tuim\u0101, a river goddess, L\u0101mpra, the god who rules the sky and ocean, and Bur\u0101sa, the forest god, the remainder being Hindu deities. Goats and buffaloes are sacrificed at their shrines, and in former times human beings were immolated. The marriage customs of the hill tribes are primitive. When a young man wishes to marry a girl, he serves for one to three years in her father\u2019s house. Infant marriage is rare, and divorce and the remarriage of widows are allowed. The dead are cremated. The other castes are immigrant Manipuris, and K\u016bkis and Chakm\u0101s from the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Agriculture supports 91 per cent. of the population and industries 3 per cent.\n\nThe nomadic tillage known as jh\u016bm cultivation is almost universal, except in the narrow strip of plain which adjoins British territory. The forest on a hill-side is cut, and burnt when it has dried; and as soon as the rains break, seeds of various crops are sown in holes made for the purpose. No agricultural statistics are available; but the principal crop and main food staple is rice, both in the plains and in the hills. Other crops grown in the plains are jute, tobacco, sugar-cane, mustard, chillies, and onions; and in the hills cotton, chillies, and sesamum. Attempts have been made of late years to induce the Tipperas to resort to plough cultivation, and a few agricultural banks have been established by the State; a model farm has also been started. The breeds of buffaloes are known as Manipuri and Bangar; the former are the stronger. Pasturage is abundant.\n\nThe forest which covers the hills contains s\u0101l (Shorea robusta), l\u016bn (Cedrela Toona), gamh\u0101r (Gmelina arborea), j\u0101rul (Lagerstroemia Flos Regiae), and garjan (Dipterocarpus turbinatus), and large quantities of bamboos and canes. The timber and other produce are floated down the rivers, and the wood is largely used for boat-building; the export duty on forest produce yields over 2 lakhs annually to the State.\nAn area of 15 square miles of forest has been reserved, in which teak, mahogany, *sissu* (*Dalbergia Sissoo*), rubber, and mulberry are being cultivated.\n\nThe only manufacture is cotton cloth of the coarsest quality made by the Manipuri and Tippera women. The principal exports are cotton, timber, sesamum, bamboos, canes, thatching grass, and firewood; an export duty is levied on all these articles. The imports are salt, kerosene oil, tobacco, and European piece-goods. The chief trade centres are Agartal\u0101, Khowai, Kail\u0101shahar, Udaipur, Bis\u0101lgarh, and Mohanpur; business is chiefly in the hands of Indian S\u0101h\u0101s. At some of these centres annual fairs are held, at which merchants from the neighbouring British Districts assemble and the hill people make their annual purchases.\n\nTraffic is carried on chiefly by water; in the dry season, when the rivers are not navigable by boats of more than 2 tons burden, rafts and canoes are used. There are 105 miles of road, mainly in the neighbourhood of Agartal\u0101; feeder-roads are now under construction to the stations on the Assam-Bengal Railway, which passes outside the western boundary of the State.\n\nThe administration is conducted by the Minister at Agartal\u0101, assisted by the *diw\u0101n* and other subordinates. The laws are framed by a legislative council, and are modelled on the laws of British India. The State is divided into seven administrative divisions\u2014Agartal\u0101, Udaipur, Son\u0101mur\u0101, Beloni\u0101, Khowai, Dharmanagar, and Kail\u0101shahar\u2014each presided over by an officer ordinarily styled Magistrate-Collector, whose duties correspond to those of a District officer in British non-regulation Districts; he is subordinate to the Minister except in judicial matters. The chief judicial authority is vested in the Kh\u0101s appellate court, which is presided over by three Judges and is similar in constitution to a Chief Court in British Provinces. Subordinate to the Kh\u0101s appellate court is a court, presided over by a Judge, which hears all civil and criminal appeals from the divisional officers and tries Sessions cases. The officials are mainly natives of Bengal, many of them graduates of the Calcutta University; but certain offices are held exclusively by the Th\u0101kurs who are connected with the R\u0101j\u0101 by marriage or otherwise. Agartal\u0101 is the only municipality.\n\nThe State revenue increased from 2.4 lakhs in 1881\u20132 to 4.6 lakhs in 1892\u20133 and 8.17 lakhs in 1903\u20134, of which 2.32 lakhs was derived from land revenue. Duties are levied on exports, such as cotton, *ti*, and forest products, bringing in 2.78 lakhs in 1903\u20134. The income derived from elephant-catching is decreasing, as these animals are becoming scarce.\nThe R\u0101j\u0101 is the proprietor of the soil, and the land is held either direct by cultivators or under taluka grants, which may be either perpetual or temporary. In the hills a family tax is realized from jhum cultivators, and rents are paid only for lands in the plains; the rates vary from 12 annas to Rs. 9\u20138, the average being Rs. 3 per acre. The State is being cadastrally surveyed and settled.\n\nA military force of 330 officers and men is maintained by the State. The force under the Superintendent of police numbers 8 inspectors, 26 d\u0101rogas, 33 naib-d\u0101rogas, 40 head constables, 49 writer constables, and 308 constables, posted at 22 police stations and 34 outposts. There is a jail at Agartala and a lock-up at each of the divisional head-quarters; the average daily number of prisoners in 1903\u20134 was 47.\n\nEducation is very backward, and in 1901 only 2\u00b73 per cent. of the population (4\u00b71 males and 0\u00b72 females) could read and write. The number of pupils under instruction increased from 619 in 1881 to 1,059 in 1892\u20133 and 1,704 in 1900\u20131, while 3,008 boys and 117 girls were at school in 1903\u20134. The number of educational institutions in that year was 103, including an Arts college, a secondary school, 99 primary schools, and 2 special schools. Of the primary schools, 88 are in the hills, and special scholarships have been founded for hill boys. An artisan school has recently been started, in which carpentry and brass and ironwork are taught. There are boarding-houses at the college and high school, where accommodation and medical aid are provided free of cost. A special boarding-house has also been established for the Th\u0101kur boys, and in connexion with it, a class has been opened for the training of such Th\u0101kurs as are willing to enter the civil service of the State; separate arrangements have also been made for the education of members of the ruling family. The expenditure on education in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 70,000, which was entirely borne by the State, all education being free.\n\nThe State maintains ten charitable dispensaries, under the control and supervision of the State physician. The total number of out-patients in 1903\u20134 was 35,269, and of in-patients 657; 401 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 26,500, entirely borne by the State. Vaccination is not compulsory, but is making progress, and 7,756 persons were vaccinated in 1903\u20134.\n\n[Sir W. W. Hunter, Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. vi; Sir A.

Literally, the name is equivalent to \u2018the abode of snow\u2019 (from the Sanskrit hima, \u2018frost,\u2019 and \u0101laya, \u2018dwelling-place\u2019). To the early geographers the mountains were known as Imaus or Himaus and Hemodas; and there is reason to believe that these names were applied to the western and eastern parts respectively, the sources of the Ganges being taken as the dividing line. \u2018Hemodas\u2019 represents the Sanskrit Him\u0101vata (P\u0101krit Hemota), meaning \u2018snowy.\u2019 The Greeks who accompanied Alexander styled the mountains the Indian Caucasus.\n\nModern writers have sometimes included in the system the Muzt\u0101gh range, and its extension the Karakoram; but it is now generally agreed that the Indus should be considered the north-western limit. From the great peak of Nanga Parbat in Kashmir, the Him\u0101layas stretch eastward for twenty degrees of longitude, in a curve which has been compared to the blade of a scimitar, the edge facing the plains of India. Barely one-third of this vast range of mountains is known with any degree of accuracy. The Indian Survey department is primarily engaged in supplying administrative needs; and although every effort is made in fulfilling this duty to collect information of purely scientific interest, much still remains to be done.\n\nA brief abstract of our knowledge of the Him\u0101layas may be given by shortly describing the political divisions of India which include them. On the extreme north-west, more than half of the State of Kashmir and Jammu lies in the Him\u0101layas, and this portion has been described in some detail by Drew in *Jammu and Kashmir Territories*, and by Sir W. Lawrence in *The Valley of Kashmir*. The next section, appertaining to the Punjab and forming the British District of Kangra and the group of feudatories known as the Simla Hill States, is better known. East of this lies the Kumaun Division of the United Provinces, attached to which is the Tehri State. This portion has been surveyed in detail, owing to the requirements of the revenue administration, and is also familiar from the careful accounts of travellers. For 500 miles the State of Nep\u0101l occupies the mountains, and is to the present day almost a *terra incognita*, owing to the acquiescence by the British Government in the policy of exclusion adopted by its rulers. Our knowledge of the topography of this portion of the Him\u0101layas is limited to the information obtained during the operations of 1816, materials\ncollected by British officials resident at K\u0101tm\u0101ndu, notably B. H. Hodgson, and the accounts of native explorers. The eastern border of Nep\u0101l is formed by the State of Sikkim and the Bengal District of Darjeeling, which have been graphically described by Sir Joseph Hooker and more recently by Mr. Douglas Freshfield. A small wedge of Tibetan territory, known as the Chumbi Valley, separates Sikkim from Bhut\u0101n, which latter has seldom been visited by Europeans. East of Bhut\u0101n the Him\u0101layas are inhabited by savage tribes, with whom no intercourse is possible except in the shape of punitive expeditions following raids on the plains. Thus a stretch of nearly 400 miles in the eastern portion of the range is imperfectly known.\n\nIn the western part of the Him\u0101layas, which, as has been shown, has been more completely examined than elsewhere, the system may be divided into three portions. The central or main axis is the highest, which, starting at Nanga Parbat on the north-west, follows the general direction of the range. Though it contains numerous lofty peaks, including Nand\u0101 Dev\u012b, the highest mountain in British India, it is not a true watershed. North of it lies another range, here forming the boundary between India and Tibet, which shuts off the valley of the Indus, and thus may be described as a real water-parting. From the central axis, and usually from the peaks in it, spurs diverge, with a general south-easterly or south-westerly direction, but actually winding to a considerable extent. These spurs, which may be called the Outer Him\u0101layas, cease with some abruptness at their southern extremities, so that the general elevation is 8,000 or 9,000 feet a few miles from the plains. Separated from the Outer Him\u0101layas by elevated valleys or d\u016bns is a lower range known as the Siw\u0101liks, which is well marked between the Be\u0101s and the Ganges, reappears to the south of central Kumaun, and is believed to exist in Nep\u0101l. Although the general character of the Him\u0101layas in Nep\u0101l is less accurately known, there is reason to suppose that it approximates to that of the western ranges.\n\nWithin the limits of this great mountain chain all varieties of scenery can be obtained, except the placid charm of level country. Luxuriant vegetation clothes the outer slopes, gradually giving place to more sombre forests. As higher elevations are reached, the very desolation of the landscape affects the imagination even more than the beautiful scenery left behind. It is not surprising that these massive peaks are venerated by the Hindus, and are intimately connected with their religion, as giving rise to some of the most sacred rivers, as well as on account of legendary associations. A recent writer has vividly described the impressions of a traveller through the foreground of a journey to the snows in Sikkim\u00b9:\n\n\u00b9 D. W. Freshfield in *The Geographical Journal*, vol. xix, p. 453.\nHe sees at one glance the shadowy valleys from which shining mist-columns rise at noon against a luminous sky, the forest ridges, stretching fold behind fold in softly undulating lines\u2014dotted by the white specks which mark the situation of Buddhist monasteries\u2014to the glacier-draped pinnacles and precipices of the snowy range. He passes from the zone of tree-ferns, bamboos, orange-groves, and dal forest, through an endless colonnade of tall-stemmed magnolias, oaks, and chestnut trees, fringed with delicate orchids and festooned by long convolvuluses, to the region of gigantic pines, junipers, firs, and larches. Down each ravine sparkles a brimming torrent, making the ferns and flowers nod as it dashes past them. Superb butterflies, black and blue, or flashes of rainbow colours that turn at pleasure into exact imitations of dead leaves, the fairies of this lavish transformation scene of Nature, sail in and out between the sunlight and the gloom. The mountaineer pushes on by a track half buried between the red twisted stems of tree-rhododendrons, hung with long waving lichens, till he emerges at last on open sky and the upper pastures\u2014the Alps of the Him\u0101laya\u2014fields of flowers: of gentians and edelweiss and poppies, which blossom beneath the shining storehouses of snow that encompass the ice-mailed and fluted shoulders of the giants of the range. If there are mountains in the world which combine as many beauties as the Sikkim Him\u0101layas, no traveller has as yet discovered and described them for us.\n\nThe line of perpetual snow varies from 15,000 to 16,000 feet on the southern exposures. In winter, snow generally falls at elevations above 5,000 feet in the west, while falls at 2,500 feet were twice recorded in Kumaun during the last century. Glaciers extend below the region of perpetual snow, descending to 12,000 or 13,000 feet in Kul\u016b and L\u0101hul, and even lower in Kumaun, while in Sikkim they are about 2,000 feet higher. On the vast store-house thus formed largely depends the prosperity of Northern India, for the great rivers which derive their water from the Him\u0101layas have a perpetual supply which may diminish in years of drought, but cannot fail absolutely to feed the system of canals drawn from them.\n\nWhile all five rivers from which the Punjab derives its name rise in the Him\u0101layas, the Sutlej alone has its source beyond the northern range, near the head-waters of the Indus and Tsan-po. In the next section are found the sources of the Jumna, Ganges, and K\u0101li or S\u0101rd\u0101 high up in the central snowy range, while the Kauri\u0101la or Karn\u0101li, known lower down in its course as the Gogra, rises in Tibet, beyond the northern watershed. The chief rivers of Nep\u0101l, the Gandak and Kosi, each with seven main affluents, have their birth in the Him\u0101layas, which here supply a number of smaller streams merging in the larger rivers soon after they reach the plains. Little is known of the upper courses of the northern tributaries of the Brahmaputra in Assam; but it seems probable that the Dih\u0101ng, which has been taken as the eastern\nboundary of the Him\u0101layas, is the channel connecting the Tsan-po and the Brahmaputra.\n\nPassing from east to west the principal peaks are Nanga Parbat (26,182 feet) in Kashmir; a peak in Spiti (K\u0101ngra District) exceeding 23,000, besides three over 20,000; Nand\u0101 Dev\u012b (25,661), Tris\u016bl (23,382), P\u0101nch Ch\u016blhi (22,673), and Nand\u0101 Kot (22,538) in the United Provinces; Mount Everest (29,002), Dev\u0101lagiri (26,826), Gosainth\u0101n (26,305) and Kinchinjunga (28,146), with several smaller peaks, in Nep\u0101l; and Dongkya (23,190), with a few rising above 20,000, in Sikkim.\n\nThe most considerable stretch of level ground is the beautiful Kashmir Valley, through which flows the Jhelum. In length about 84 miles, it has a breadth varying from 20 to 25 miles. Elsewhere steep ridges and comparatively narrow gorges are the rule, the chief exception being the Valley of Nep\u0101l, which is an undulating plain about 20 miles from north to south, and 12 to 14 miles in width. Near the city of Srinagar is the Dal Lake, described as one of the most picturesque in the world. Though measuring only 4 miles by 2\u00bd, its situation among the mountains, and the natural beauty of its banks, combined with the endeavours of the Mughal emperors to embellish it, unite to form a scene of great attractions. Some miles away is the larger expanse of water known as the Wular Lake, which ordinarily covers 12\u00bd square miles, but in years of flood expands to over 100. A number of smaller lakes, some of considerable beauty, are situated in the outer ranges in Naini T\u0101l District. In 1903 the Gohn\u0101 Lake, in Garhw\u0101l District, was formed by the subsidence of a steep hill, rising 4,000 feet above the level of a stream which it blocked.\n\nThe geological features of the Him\u0101layas can be conveniently grouped into three classes, roughly corresponding to the three main orographical zones: (1) the Tibetan highland zone, (2) the zone of snowy peaks and Outer Him\u0101layas, and (3) the Sub-Him\u0101layas.\n\nIn the Tibetan highlands there is a fine display of marine fossiliferous rocks, ranging in age from Lower Palaeozoic to Tertiary. In the zone of the snowy peaks granites and crystalline schists are displayed, fringed by a mantle of unfossiliferous rocks of old, but generally unknown, age, forming the lower hills or Outer Him\u0101layas, while in the Sub-Him\u0101layas the rocks are practically all of Tertiary age, and are derived from the waste of the highlands to the north.\n\nThe disposition of these rocks indicates the existence of a range of some sort since lower palaeozoic times, and shows that the present southern boundary of the marine strata on the northern side of the crystalline axis is not far from the original shore of the ocean in which these strata were laid down. The older unfossiliferous rocks of the\n\n---\n\n1 By T. H. Holland, Geological Survey of India.\nLower Him\u0101layas on the southern side of the main crystalline axis are more nearly in agreement with the rocks which have been preserved without disturbance in the Indian Peninsula; and even remains of the great Gondw\u0101na river-formations which include our valuable deposits of coal are found in the Darjeeling area, involved in the folding movements which in later geological times raised the Him\u0101layas to be the greatest among the mountain ranges of the world. The Him\u0101layas were thus marked out in very early times, but the main folding took place in the Tertiary era. The great outflow of the Deccan trap was followed by a depression of the area to the north and west, the sea in eocene times spreading itself over R\u0101jput\u0101na and the Indus valley, covering the Punjab to the foot of the Outer Him\u0101layas as far east as the Ganges, at the same time invading on the east the area now occupied by Assam. Then followed a rise of the land and consequent retreat of the sea, the fresh-water deposits which covered the eocene marine strata being involved in the movement as fast as they were formed, until the Sub-Him\u0101layan zone river-deposits, no older than the pliocene, became tilted up and even overturned in the great foldings of the strata. This final rise of the Him\u0101layan range in late Tertiary times was accompanied by the movements which gave rise to the Arakan Yoma and the N\u0101g\u0101 Hills on the east, and the hills of Baluchist\u0101n and Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n on the west.\n\nThe rise of the Him\u0101layan range may be regarded as a great buckle in the earth's crust, which raised the great Central Asian plateau in late Tertiary times, folding over in the Baikal region on the north against the solid mass of Siberia, and curling over as a great wave on the south against the firmly resisting mass of the Indian Peninsula.\n\nAs an index to the magnitude of this movement within the Tertiary era, we find the marine fossil foraminifer, *Nummulites*, which lived in eocene times in the ocean, now at elevations of 20,000 feet above sea-level in Z\u0101sk\u0101r. With the rise of the Him\u0101layan belt, there occurred a depression at its southern foot, into which the alluvial material brought down from the hills has been dropped by the rivers. In miocene times, when presumably the Him\u0101layas did not possess their present elevation, the rivers deposited fine sands and clays in this area; and as the elevatory process went on, these deposits became tilted up, while the rivers, attaining greater velocity with their increased gradient, brought down coarser material and formed conglomerates in pliocene times. These also became elevated and cut into by their own rivers, which are still working along their old courses, bringing down boulders to be deposited at the foot of the hills and carrying out the finer material farther over the Indo-Gangetic plain.\n\nThe series of rocks which have thus been formed by the rivers, and afterwards raised to form the Sub-Him\u0101layas, are known as the Siw\u0101lik\nseries. They are divisible into three stages. In the lowest and oldest, distinguished as the N\u0101han stage, the rocks are fine sandstones and red clays without any pebbles. In the middle stage, strings of pebbles are found with the sandstones, and these become more abundant towards the top, until we reach the conglomerates of the upper stage. Along the whole length of the Him\u0101layas these Siw\u0101lik rocks are cut off from the older rock systems of the higher hills by a great reversed fault, which started in early Siw\u0101lik times and developed as the folding movements raised the mountains and involved in its rise the deposits formed along the foot of the range. The Siw\u0101lik strata never extended north of this great boundary fault, but the continued rise of the mountains affected these deposits, and raised them up to form the outermost zone of hills.\n\nThe upper stage of the Siw\u0101lik series is famous on account of the rich collection of fossil vertebrates which it contains. Among these there are forms related to the miocene mammals of Europe, some of which, like the hippopotamus, are now unknown in India but have relatives in Africa. Many of the mammals now characteristic of India were represented by individuals of much greater size and variety of species in Siwalik times.\n\nThe unfossiliferous rocks which form the Outer Him\u0101layas are of unknown age, and may possibly belong in part to the unfossiliferous rocks of the Peninsula, like the Vindhya and the Cuddapahs. Conspicuous among these rocks are the dolomitic limestones of Jauns\u0101r and Kumaun, the probable equivalents of the similar rocks far away to the east at Buxa in the Du\u0101rs. With these a series of purple quartzites and basic lava-flow is often associated. In the Simla area the unfossiliferous rocks have been traced out with considerable detail; and it has been shown that quartzites, like those of Jauns\u0101r and Kumaun, are overlaid by a system of rocks which has been referred to the carbonaceous system on account of the black carbonaceous slates which it includes. The only example known of pre-Tertiary fossiliferous rocks south of the snowy range in the Him\u0101layas occurs in south-west Garhw\u0101l, where there are a few fragmentary remains of mesozoic fossils of marine origin.\n\nThe granite rocks, which form the core of the snowy range and in places occur also in the Lower Him\u0101layas, are igneous rocks which may have been intruded at different periods in the history of the range. They are fringed with crystalline schists, in which a progressive metamorphism is shown from the edge of granitic rock outwards, and in the inner zone the granitic material and the pre-existing sedimentary rock have become so intimately mixed that a typical banded gneiss is produced. The resemblance of these gneisses to the well-known gneisses of Archaean age in the Peninsula and in other parts of the\nworld led earlier observers to suppose that the gneissose rocks of the Central Him\u0101layas formed an Archaean core, against which the sediments were subsequently laid down. But as we now know for certain that both granites, such as we have in the Him\u0101layas, and banded gneisses may be much younger, even Tertiary in age, the mere composition and structure give no clue to the age of the crystalline axis. The position of the granite rock is probably dependent on the development of low-pressure areas during the process of folding, and there is thus a prima facie reason for supposing that much of the igneous material became injected during the Tertiary period. With the younger intrusions, however, there are probably remains of injections which occurred during the more ancient movements, and there may even be traces of the very ancient Archaean gneisses; for we know that pebbles of gneisses occur in the Cambrian conglomerates of the Tibetan zone, and these imply the existence of gneissose rocks exposed to the atmosphere in neighbouring highlands. The gneissose granite of the Central Him\u0101layas must have consolidated under great pressure, with a thick superincumbent envelope of sedimentary strata; and their exposure to the atmosphere thus implies a long period of effectual erosion by weathering agents, which have cut down the softer sediments more easily and left the more resisting masses of crystalline rocks to form the highest peaks in the range. Excellent illustrations of the relationship of the gneissose granites to the rocks into which they have been intruded are displayed in the Dhaola Dh\u0101r in Kul\u016b, in the Chor Peak in Garhw\u0101l, and in the Darjeeling region east of Nep\u0101l.\n\nBeyond the snowy range in the Tibetan zone we have a remarkable display of fossiliferous rocks, which alone would have been enough to make the Him\u0101layas famous in the geological world. The boundary between Tibetan territory and Spiti and Kumaun has been the area most exhaustively studied by the Geological Survey. The rocks exposed in this zone include deposits which range in age from Cambrian to Tertiary. The oldest fossiliferous system, distinguished as the Haimanta ('snow-covered') system, includes some 3,000 feet of the usual sedimentary types, with fragmentary fossils which indicate Cambrian and Silurian affinities. Above this system there are representatives of the Devonian and Carboniferous of Europe, followed by a conglomerate which marks a great stratigraphical break at the beginning of Permian times in Northern India. Above the conglomerate comes one of the most remarkably complete succession of sediments known, ranging from Permian, without a sign of disturbance in the process of sedimentation, throughout the whole Mesozoic epoch to the beginning of Tertiary times. The highly fossiliferous character of some of the formations in this great pile of strata, like the Productus shales and the Spiti shales, has made this area classic ground to the palaeontologist.\nThe Eurasian ocean distinguished by the name 'Thetys,' which spread over this area throughout the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic times, became driven back by the physical revolution which began early in Tertiary times, when the folding movements gave rise to the modern Himalayas. As relics of this ocean have been discovered in Burma and China it will not be surprising to find, when the ground has been more thoroughly explored, that highly fossiliferous rocks are preserved also in the Tibetan zone beyond the snowy ranges of Nepal and Sikkim.\n\nOf the minerals of value, graphite has been recorded in the Kumaun Division; coal occurs frequently amongst the Nummulitic (eocene) rocks of the foot-hills and the Gondw\u0101na strata of Darjeeling District; bitumen has been found in small quantities in Kumaun; stibnite, a sulphide of antimony, occurs associated with ores of zinc and lead in well-defined lodes in L\u0101hul; gold is obtained in most of the rivers, and affords a small and precarious living for a few washers; copper occurs very widely disseminated and sometimes forms distinct lodes of value in the slaty series south of the snowy range, as in the Kul\u016b, Kumaun, and Darjeeling areas; ferruginous schists sometimes rich in iron occur under similar geological conditions, as in K\u0101ngra and Kumaun; sapphires of considerable value have been obtained in Z\u0101sk\u0101r and turquoise from the central highlands; salt is being mined in quantity from near the boundary of the Tertiary and older rocks in the State of Mandi; borax and salt are obtained from lakes beyond the Tibetan border; slate-quarrying is a flourishing industry along the southern slopes of the Dhaola Dh\u0101r in K\u0101ngra District; mica of poor quality is extracted from the pegmatites of Kul\u016b; and a few other minerals of little value, besides building stones, are obtained in various places. A small trade is developed, too, by selling the fossils from the Spiti shales as sacred objects.\n\nThe general features of the great variety in vegetation have been illustrated in the quotation from Mr. Freshfield's description of Sikkim. These variations are naturally due to an increase in elevation, and to the decrease in rainfall and humidity passing from south to north, and from east to west. The tropical zone of dense forest extends up to about 6,500 feet in the east, and 5,000 feet in the west. In the Eastern Himalayas orchids are numerically the predominant order of flowering plants; while in Kumaun about 62 species, both epiphytic and terrestrial, have been found. A temperate zone succeeds, ranging to about 12,000 feet, in which oaks, pines, and tree-rhododendrons are conspicuous, with chestnut, maple, magnolia, and laurel in the east. Where rain and mist are not excessive, as for example in Kul\u016b and Kumaun, European fruit trees (apples, pears, apricots, and peaches) have been naturalized very successfully, and an important crop of potatoes is obtained in the west. Above about 12,000 feet the forests\nbecome thinner. Birch and willow mixed with dwarf rhododendrons continue for a time, till the open pasture land is reached, which is richly adorned in the summer months with brilliant Alpine species of flowers. Contrasting the western with the eastern section we find that the former is far less rich, though it has been better explored, while there is a preponderance of European species. A fuller account of the botanical features of the Him\u0101layas will be found in Vol. I, chap. iv.\n\nTo obtain a general idea of the fauna of the Him\u0101layas it is sufficient to consider the whole system as divided into two tracts: namely, the area in the lower hills where forests can flourish, and the area above the forests. The main characteristics of these tracts have been summarized by the late Dr. W. T. Blanford\\(^1\\). In the forest area the fauna differs markedly from that of the Indian Peninsula stretching away from the base of the hills. It does not contain the so-called Aryan element of mammals, birds, and reptiles which are related to Ethiopian and Holarctic genera, and to the pliocene Siw\u0101lik fauna, nor does it include the Dravidian element of reptiles and batrachians. On the other hand, it includes the following animals which do not occur in the Peninsula\u2014Mammals: the families Simiidae, Procyonidae, Talpidae, and Spalacidae, and the sub-family Gymnurinae, besides numerous genera, such as Prionodon, Helictis, Arctonyx, Atherrura, Nemorhaedus, and Cemas. Birds: the families Eurylaemidae, Indicatoridae, and Heliornithidae, and the sub family Paradoxornithinae. Reptiles: Platysternidae and Anguidae. Batrachians: Dyscophidae, Hylidae, Pelobatidae, and Salamandridae. Compared with the Peninsula, the fauna of the forest area is poor in reptiles and batrachians.\n\n\\(^1\\) 'The Distribution of Vertebrate Animals in India, Ceylon, and Burma,' Proceedings, Royal Society, vol. lxvii, p. 484.\n\nIt also contains but few peculiar genera of mammals and birds, and almost all the peculiar types that do occur have Holarctic affinities. The Oriental element in the fauna is very richly represented in the Eastern Him\u0101layas and gradually diminishes to the westward, until in Kashmir and farther west it ceases to be the principal constituent. These facts are consistent with the theory that the Oriental constituent of the Him\u0101layan fauna, or the greater portion of it, has migrated into the mountains from the eastward at a comparatively recent period. It is an important fact that this migration appears to have been from Assam and not from the Peninsula of India.\n\nDr. Blanford suggested that the explanation was to be found in the conditions of the glacial epoch. When the spread of snow and ice took place, the tropical fauna, which may at that time have resembled more closely that of the Peninsula, was forced to retreat to the base of the mountains or perished. At such a time the refuge afforded by the Assam Valley and the hill ranges south of it, with their damp,\nsheltered, forest-clad valleys, would be more secure than the open plains of Northern India and the drier hills of the country south of these. As the cold epoch passed away, the Oriental fauna re-entered the Him\u0101layas from the east.\n\nAbove the forests the Him\u0101layas belong to the Tibetan sub-region of the Holarctic region, and the fauna differs from that of the Indo-Malay region, 44 per cent. of the genera recorded from the Tibetan tract not being found in the Indo-Malay region. During the glacial epoch the Holarctic forms apparently survived in great numbers.\n\nOwing to the rugged nature of the country, which makes travelling difficult and does not invite immigrants, the inhabitants of the Him\u0101layas present a variety of ethnical types which can hardly be summarized briefly. Two common features extending over a large area may be referred to. From Lad\u0101kh in Kashmir to Bhut\u0101n are found races of Indo-Chinese type, speaking dialects akin to Tibetan and professing Buddhism. In the west these features are confined to the higher ranges; but in Sikkim, Darjeeling, and Bhut\u0101n they are found much nearer the plains of India. Excluding Burma, this tract of the Him\u0101layas is the only portion of India in which Buddhism is a living religion. As in Tibet, it is largely tinged by the older animistic beliefs of the people. Although the Muhammadans made various determined efforts to conquer the hills, they were generally unsuccessful, yielding rather to the difficulties of transport and climate than to the forces brought against them by the scanty though brave population of the hills. In the twelfth century a Tartar horde invaded Kashmir, but succumbed to the rigours of the snowy passes. Subsequently a Tibetan soldier of fortune seized the supreme power and embraced Isl\u0101m. Late in the fourteenth century the Muhammadan ruler of the country, Sult\u0101n Sikandar, pressed his religion by force on the people, and in the province of Kashmir proper 94 per cent. of the total are now Muhammadans. Baltist\u0101n is also inhabited chiefly by Muhammadans, but the proportion is much less in Jammu, and beyond the Kashmir State Isl\u0101m has few followers. Hinduism becomes an important religion in Jammu, and is predominant in the southern portions of the Him\u0101layas within the Punjab and the United Provinces. It is the religion of the ruling dynasty in Nep\u0101l, where, however, Buddhism is of almost equal strength. East of Nep\u0101l Hindus are few. Where Hinduism prevails, the language in common use, known as Pah\u0101r\u012b, presents a strong likeness to the languages of R\u0101jput\u0101na, thus confirming the traditions of the higher classes that their ancestors migrated from the plains of India. In Nep\u0101l the languages spoken are more varied, and New\u0101r\u012b, the ancient state language, is akin to Tibetan. The Mongolian element in the population is strongly marked in the east, but towards the west has been pushed back into\nthe higher portion of the ranges. In Kumaun are found a few shy people living in the recesses of the jungles, and having little intercourse with their more civilized neighbours. Tribes which appear to be akin to these are found in Nep\u0101l, but little is known about them. North of Assam the people are of Tibeto-Burman origin, and are styled, passing from west to east, the Ak\u0101s, Dafl\u0101s, M\u012bris, and Abors, the last name signifying 'unknown savages.' Colonel Dalton has described these people in his Ethnology of Bengal.\n\nFrom the commercial point of view the agricultural products of the Him\u0101layas, with few exceptions, are of little importance. The chief food-grains cultivated are, in the outer ranges, rice, wheat, barley, maru\u0101, and amaranth. In the hot, moist valleys, chillies, turmeric, and ginger are grown. At higher levels potatoes have become an important crop in Kumaun; and, as already mentioned, in Kul\u016b and Kumaun European fruits have been successfully naturalized, including apples, pears, cherries, and strawberries. Two crops are obtained in the lower hills; but cultivation is attended by enormous difficulties, owing to the necessity of terracing and clearing land of stones, while irrigation is practicable only by long channels winding along the hill-sides from the nearest suitable stream or spring. As the snowy ranges are approached wheat and buckwheat, grown during the summer months, are the principal crops, and only one harvest in the year can be obtained. Tea gardens were successfully established in Kumaun during the first half of the nineteenth century, but the most important gardens are now situated in K\u0101ngr\u0101 and Darjeeling. In the latter District cinchona is grown for the manufacture of quinine and cinchona febrifuge.\n\nThe most valuable forests are found in the Outer Him\u0101layas, yielding a number of timber trees, among which may be mentioned s\u0101l, shisham (Dalbergia Sissoo), and t\u016bn (Cedrela toona). Higher up are found the deod\u0101r and various kinds of pine, which are also extracted wherever means of transport can be devised. In the Eastern Him\u0101layas wild rubber is collected by the hill tribes already mentioned, and brought for sale to the Districts of the Assam Valley.\n\nCommunications within the hills are naturally difficult. Railways have hitherto been constructed only to three places in the outer hills: Jammu in the Kashmir State, Simla in the Punjab, and Darjeeling in Bengal. Owing to the steepness of the hill-sides and the instability of the strata composing them, these lines have been costly to build and maintain. A more ambitious project is now being carried out to connect the Kashmir Valley with the plains, motive power being supplied by electricity to be generated by the Jhelum river. The principal road practicable for wheeled traffic is also in Kashmir, leading from R\u0101walpindi in the plains through Murree and B\u0101ramula.\nto Srinagar. Other cart-roads have been made connecting with the plains the hill stations of Dharm\u0101la, Simla, Chakr\u0101ta, Mussoorie, Dalhousie, Nain\u012b T\u0101l, and R\u0101nikhet. In the interior the roads are merely bridle-paths. The great rivers flowing in deep gorges are crossed by suspension bridges made of the rudest materials. The sides consist of canes and twisted fibres, and the footway may be a single bamboo laid on horizontal canes supported by ropes attached to the sides. These frail constructions, oscillating from side to side under the tread of the traveller, are crossed with perfect confidence by the natives, even when bearing heavy loads. On the more frequented paths, such as the pilgrim road from Hardw\u0101r up the valley of the Ganges to the holy shrines of Badrin\u0101th and Kedarn\u0101th, more substantial bridges have been constructed by Government, and the roads are regularly repaired. Sheep and, in the higher tracts, yaks and crosses between the yak and ordinary cattle are used as beasts of burden. The trade with Tibet is carried over lofty passes, the difficulties of which have not yet been ameliorated by engineers. Among these the following may be mentioned: the Kangwa La (15,500 feet) on the Hindust\u0101n-Tibet road through Simla; the M\u0101n\u0101 (18,000), Nit\u016b (16,570), and Balcha Dhr\u0101 in Garhw\u0101l; the Anta Dhr\u0101 (17,270), Lampiya Dhr\u0101 (18,000), and Lip\u016b Lekh (16,750) in Almor\u0101; and the Jelep La (14,390) in Sikkim.\n\n[More detailed information about the various portions of the Himalayas will be found in the articles on the political divisions referred to above. An admirable summary of the orography of the Him\u0101layas is contained in Lieut.-Col. H. H. Godwin-Austen\u2019s presidential address to the Geographical Section of the British Association in 1883 (Proceedings, Royal Geographical Society, 1883, p. 610; and 1884, pp. 83 and 112, with a map).

A. Sherring, Western Tibet and the British Borderland (1906); and D. W. Freshfield, Round Kangchenjunga (1903), which contains a full bibliography for the Eastern Him\u0101layas. An account of the Him\u0101layas by officers of the Survey of India and the Geological department is under preparation.]\n\nHindan (also called Chhaja in its upper course).\u2014A river of the United Provinces, rising in the southern slopes of the Siw\u0101lik in Sah\u0101ranpur District (30\u00b0 7\u2032 N., 77\u00b0 47\u2032 E.), and draining the central portions of Sah\u0101ranpur, Muzaffarnagar, and Meerut. It flows generally towards the south-west, and falls into the Jumna after a course of\n160 miles, a few miles after entering the north-western corner of Bulandshahr. The K\u0101l\u012b N\u0101d\u012b (West) is the chief tributary. Its water is nowhere used for irrigation, but part of its channel forms an important link between the Ganges and Jumna. Thus water can be passed into the Hindan from the Upper Ganges Canal, and thence, by means of a cut made from a point close to Gh\u0101zi\u0101b\u0101d in 1877, into the Jumna above Okhla, increasing the supply of water for the Agra Canal. This cut was made wider in 1884 and further improved in 1901, and is now navigable.\n\nHindaun.\u2014Head-quarters of the niz\u0101mat and tahs\u012bl of the same name in the State of Jaipur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in 26\u00b0 44\u2032 N. and 77\u00b0 3\u2032 E., about 75 miles east by south-east of Jaipur city. It is connected by metalled road with Hindaun Road (also called Mand\u0101war), a station on the R\u0101jput\u0101na M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway, 32 miles to the north, and with Karauli town, about 16 miles to the south. Population (1901), 11,938. Hindaun was once an extensive city, but it suffered from the devastations of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, and the rampart which once surrounded it is now in ruins. It is, however, the principal mart for the cotton, grain, oilseeds, and opium grown in this part of the State, and the road above mentioned is an important trade route. A fair, in honour of Mah\u0101b\u012br, whose temple is said to be very old, is held yearly in April, attended chiefly by J\u0101ts and Min\u0101s. The iron mines at Karwar, a few miles to the east, have long been abandoned; but a good deal of red and white sandstone is quarried in the neighbourhood, and used for building and other purposes. At Mand\u0101war is a State cotton-press, which during the year 1904 yielded a net profit of Rs. 7,200, or about 6 per cent. on the capital cost. The town of Hindaun possesses a post office, 6 schools attended by about 230 pupils, and a hospital with accommodation for 4 in-patients.\n\nHindol.\u2014One of the Tributary States of Orissa, Bengal, lying between 20\u00b0 29\u2032 and 20\u00b0 49\u2032 N. and 85\u00b0 6\u2032 and 85\u00b0 30\u2032 E., with an area of 312 square miles. It is bounded on the north and east by the State of Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l; on the south by Bar\u0101mb\u0101 and Narsinghpur; and on the west by Angul District. Hindol consisted originally of three or four petty States completely buried in jungle, till two brothers, belonging to the family of the Kimedi R\u0101j\u0101 in Madras, drove out the old chiefs and formed their territories into one principality. The State has an estimated revenue of Rs. 70,000, and pays tribute of Rs. 551 to the British Government. The population increased from 37,973 in 1891 to 47,180 in 1901, part of the growth being due to an accession of new settlers. The number of villages is 234, one of which, Hindol, is the residence of the chief; the density is 151 persons per square mile. Of the total population, all but 200 are Hindus. The most numerous castes are Ch\u0101sas (11,000) and P\u0101ns.\nThe old Cuttack-Sambalpur high road runs through the State in a south-easterly direction, and small quantities of country produce are thus brought to the Mah\u0101nadi and there sold to travelling merchants. A branch road, $7\\frac{1}{2}$ miles in length, connects the main road with the village containing the R\u0101j\u0101's residence. Excellent oranges are grown in the R\u0101j\u0101's gardens, and the soil generally appears to be well suited for the cultivation of this valuable fruit. The State maintains one middle English school, 3 upper primary, and 57 lower primary schools, and a charitable dispensary.\n\n**Hindoli.**\u2014Head-quarters of the *tahsil* of the same name in the State of B\u016bndi, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in $25\u00b0 35' N.$ and $75\u00b0 30' E.$, about 15 miles north-west of B\u016bndi town. Population (1901), 2,162. The village is picturesquely situated at the base of some low hills, on one of which stands a palace built by Prat\u0101p Singh, a member of the ruling family, in the middle of the seventeenth century. To the north of the village lies an artificial lake, about one square mile in area, called the R\u0101m S\u0101gar after a Mah\u0101jan named R\u0101ma S\u0101h, who is said to have constructed its embankment about 500 years ago. At the north-eastern extremity of the dam is a group of handsome cenotaphs, all of the seventeenth century.\n\n**Hindost\u0101n.** See Hindust\u0101n.\n\n**Hindub\u0101gh.**\u2014*Tahsil* of the Upper Zhob subdivision of the Zhob District, Baluchist\u0101n, lying between $30\u00b0 36' N.$ and $31\u00b0 50' N.$ and $67\u00b0 27' E.$ and $68\u00b0 46' E.$ It is bounded on the north by the Toba-K\u0101kar range, which separates it from Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n. Its area is 3,275 square miles, and population (1901) 15,777. The land revenue, including grazing tax, amounted in 1903-4 to Rs. 24,000. The head-quarters station, which bears the same name as the *tahsil*, lies in the south-west corner. The *tahsil* possesses 76 villages. The main valley, called Zhob n\u0101wah from its boat-like shape, lies along the upper course of the Zhob river, while the northern part covers the grassy uplands of K\u0101kar Khor\u0101s\u0101n. The greater part of the cultivation is irrigated; rains crops are comparatively insignificant. Under the Kand mountain lies the picturesque glen of Kamchughai. Asbestos deposits exist in the valley.\n\n**Hindu Kush** (Mountains of the Moon).\u2014This great range, known to the ancient geographers as the 'Indian Caucasus,' may be said to start from a point near $37\u00b0 N.$ and $74\u00b0 38' E.$, where the Him\u0101layan system finds its north-western termination in a mass of towering peaks, and to extend south-westwards across North-Eastern Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n to about $34\u00b0 30' N.$ and $68\u00b0 15' E.$ The first spur which it throws off to the north is from the vicinity of Tirich M\u012br, in the north-western corner of Chitr\u0101l. Starting in a westerly direction, this spur takes a northward curve and then again runs westward, dividing the Oxus from the\nKokcha: this may be termed the Badakhsh\u0101n ridge. To the east of the Kh\u0101wak pass, another spur runs north, and then sprays out north-east and north-west, separating the Kokcha drainage from that of the Kund\u016bz: this may be called the Kokcha ridge. From the Kh\u0101wak pass a branch goes north-west towards Kund\u016bz or Katagh\u0101n, where it ends, forming the Kund\u016bz ridge. There is another spur, running almost parallel with this, which may be called the Kh\u0101wak ridge. A fifth spur is the Koh-i-Chang\u016br, which divides the Kund\u016bz (or Surkh\u0101b) from the Tashkurgh\u0101n river. West of the Dor\u0101h pass a region of spurs is thrown out to the south, which form the K\u0101firist\u0101n watersheds; and west again of these a great spur divides Panjsh\u012br from K\u0101firist\u0101n.\n\nThe general elevation of the Hindu Kush from its eastern extremity to the Kh\u0101wak may be taken as between 14,500 and 18,000 feet, while there are numerous peaks of between 20,000 and 25,000 feet. The range is everywhere jagged, precipitous, and arid: it is destitute of trees, and there is but little grass or herbage. Above 15,000 feet snow is perpetual. A more inhospitable region it is difficult to imagine, but the scenery is often sublime.\n\nNo table-lands like those of Tibet support the northern sides of the Hindu Kush, which sinks abruptly into the low plains of Turkist\u0101n. Until recently, information about the Hindu Kush, and the entire mountain system of which it forms a part, has been extremely defective. But the inaccurate narratives of Moorcroft, Vigne, and others have been amplified, corrected, and partly superseded by the investigation of Sir Douglas Forsyth\u2019s mission of 1873, and by the still more recent Russo-Afghan Boundary Commission in 1884\u20136 and Sir William Lockhart\u2019s mission in 1885. In the eastern Hindu Kush region political relations with the tribes have been established on a firm basis, and the country right up to K\u0101firist\u0101n is no longer a terra incognita. Some of the valleys of K\u0101firist\u0101n also have been visited by Sir George Robertson. The term \u2018Hindu Kush\u2019 was said by Sir A. Burnes to be unknown to the Afgh\u0101ns; but it is admitted by the same writer that there is a particular peak, and also a pass, bearing the name.\n\n1 A systematic survey of the rocks of the Hindu Kush has never been made; but isolated observations at different times show that intrusive granitic and accompanying basic igneous rocks, resembling those of the crystalline axis of the Him\u0101layas, are associated with schists, quartzites, slates, and limestones of the kind better known in the regions of Kashmir, B\u0101ltist\u0101n, &c. The limestones of Chitr\u0101l are of unusual importance, on account of their including fossils which show their age to be Devonian. The association of this limestone with a purple sandstone and a boulder-bed is very similar to that which is known as the\n\n1 Contributed by Mr. T. H. Holland, Director, Geological Survey of India.\ninfra-trias series in parts of the North-Western Him\u0101layas; and as these rocks appear to be unfossiliferous, the Chitr\u0101l fossils afford an index, by analogy, to their age also. Owing to the way in which the limestones of the Hindu Kush have been altered by igneous intrusions, it is impossible to say what systems are represented; but, besides the Devonian of Chitr\u0101l on the southern and south-eastern slopes, it is probable that the Permian and younger rocks known in Afgh\u0101n territory extended into the range, and became folded and altered by the granitic intrusions which Griesbach\\(^1\\) regarded as mainly Cretaceous in age. The folding system has a general west-south-west, east-north-east trend.\n\nAs usual with areas of this kind in the Him\u0101layan region, where igneous rocks of various kinds are found intruded into pre-existing sediments, small quantities of gold are obtained in the rivers which cut through and sift the minerals obtained by the action of the weather on the metamorphosed area.\n\nThe fauna and flora of the Eastern Hindu Kush are similar to those of the Him\u0101layas lying within the same latitudes. In this region are found the wild goat, the snow ounce, and the wild dog, this last being sometimes met with in packs. Among the snow and ice, the ibex, the red bear, and the snow-cock share a rarely broken solitude. Wild sheep are numerous below the glacial region.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Hindu Kush are of mixed races, languages, and religions, and possess different political and domestic institutions. The valleys and gorges, many of them extremely fertile, contain the great majority of the inhabitants, but some of the cave-dwellings of the mountaineers called forth the admiration of Marco Polo. The eastern valley communities average from 200 to 4,000 people, who maintain an attitude of independence towards their neighbours. Many centuries have passed since the original inhabitants of the central and western mountains were either converted to Muhammadanism and absorbed by their conquerors, or were driven out and forced to flee to less accessible valleys. The S\u0101h\u012bs, who now dwell in the mountains north of Jal\u0101lab\u0101d, are probably allied by descent to their eastern neighbours in K\u0101f\u012br\u012bstan. In the Northern Hindu Kush the T\u0101jiks are probably descended from an old Ir\u0101nian stock who were the original occupants of that region. The Badakhshis of the hills are Shi'ahs, while those of the plain country are principally Sunnis. Traces of fire-worship have been found in a few places. In W\u0101kh\u0101n, and in Hunza, Y\u0101sin, and the adjacent valleys, there is a distinct sect, called Mughlis or Maulais, who are connected by Sir H. Yule with the mediaeval 'Assassins,' and with the Druses of the Lebanon. What their origin or beliefs are, it is\n\n\\(^1\\) C. L. Griesbach, 'Field Notes from Afghanistan,' Records, Geological Survey of India, vol. xx, parts i and ii.\ndifficult to discover. They hold 'that a man should conceal his faith and his women,' but they are known to believe in the transmigration of souls. It is also known that they pay tithes to the Agha Kh\u0101n of Bombay as their spiritual leader. They hold Sunni and Shiah Muhammadans in equal contempt: the Sunni is a dog and the Shiah an ass. They revere the Kal\u0101m-i-P\u012br, a Persian work shown only to men of the Maulai faith, instead of the Kor\u0101n. They drink wine, and their spiritual guides do not profess celibacy. The Persian account of the sect is, that it was founded in 1496 by M\u012br Sham-ud-d\u012bn, who in that year came to Kashmir out of Ir\u0101k, and whose followers took the name of N\u016br Bakhsh ('illuminati'). The Mughli or N\u016br Bakhsh tenets are also prevalent in B\u0101ltist\u0101n.\n\nIn the Eastern Hindu Kush the people may be divided into four distinct castes or classes: namely, Ronos, Shins, Yashk\u016bns, and the low castes, such as Doms, Kramins, Shoto, &c. The terms D\u0101rd and D\u0101rist\u0101n have been applied by Dr. Leitner to several of the tribes and the valleys they inhabit. The latter term is merely a convenient expression embracing a large tract of country inhabited by cognate races. It applies to all the country lying between K\u0101f\u012brist\u0101n on the west and Kashmir and K\u0101g\u0101n on the east. The religion of all at the present time is an easy-going species of Muhammadanism, said to have been introduced in the course of the fourteenth century, and particularly noticed by Marco Polo. That the former religion of the western portion of this region was a form of Hinduism, and not of Buddhism, there can be little doubt. The preservation of a caste system, and the sanctity of the cow among the Shins, point to this conclusion, while no traditional reverence survives for the Buddhist remains still to be found in the country. In spite of the general conversion of the tribes to Isl\u0101m, archaic semi-religious festivals, mostly connected with agriculture, are still observed in many parts, more or less in accordance with ancient customs. The mountain villages where Shins are in the majority retain a trace of former idolatry in the sacred stones set up, in one form or another, in almost every hamlet. An oath sworn over such a stone is held to be absolutely binding. In disposition the people are tractable, good-tempered, fond of rejoicing and merry-making, neither cruel nor quarrelsome, and they submit readily to constituted authority. Hawking, dancing, and polo are universal amusements, but polo is rarely played north of the Hindu Kush. Polygamy and concubinage are practised by all who can afford it, and the right of divorce is somewhat freely exercised. Infidelity is extremely common, and the men show none of the jealousy of their wives usual in Muhammadan communities. Apparently morality was still more lax formerly than it is now. Isl\u0101m has not yet brought about the seclusion of women, who mix freely with men on all occasions.\nHindupur Taluk.\u2014Southern taluk of Anantapur District, Madras, lying between $13^\\circ 41'$ and $14^\\circ 8'$ N. and $77^\\circ 24'$ and $77^\\circ 55'$ E., with an area of 426 square miles. The population in 1901 was 92,088, compared with 80,486 in 1891. There are 74 villages and one town, Hindupur (population, 19,575), the head-quarters. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 1,92,000. On the east and through the centre run two lines of hills, north and south. Between them is a series of undulating uplands. Both the Penner and Chitravati rivers traverse the taluk in the same direction, but neither is much utilized for irrigation. Hindupur, however, receives more rain than its northern neighbours, has a better soil and a considerable number of rain-fed tanks; it is consequently richer, less sparsely peopled, and increasing in population more rapidly than they are.\n\nHindupur Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluk of the same name in Anantapur District, Madras, situated in $13^\\circ 49'$ N. and $77^\\circ 29'$ E., close to the Penner, and on the branch of the Southern Mahratta Railway which runs from Guntakal to Bangalore, 70 miles south of Anantapur town. Population (1901), 19,575. Hindupur is the largest town in the District and the centre of the commerce of its southern portion. Tradition says that it was founded by Morari Rao and called after his father, whose title was Hindu Rao. It does a large and increasing trade in jaggery (coarse sugar), piece-goods, and grain, mostly with Bangalore. Hand-weaving of gunny sacking, common cloth, and blankets is also carried on. Latterly fears of plague have done much to deter traders from visiting it, and its commerce has fallen off.\n\nHind\u016br.\u2014One of the Simla Hill States, Punjab. See N\u0101l\u0101garh.\n\nHindust\u0101n.\u2014A vaguely-defined area, sometimes applied to the whole of India north of the Vindhyas, in contradistinction to the Deccan (Dakshin, \u2018south\u2019), which lies south of them. Hindust\u0101n, in this sense, is bounded on the north by the Him\u0101layas, on the east by Assam, on the south by the Vindhya, and on the west extends into the Punjab and R\u0101jput\u0101na. It accordingly comprises the administrative tracts forming the Lieutenant-Governorships of Bengal and the United Provinces, together with the eastern portions of the Punjab and R\u0101jput\u0101na, and most of Eastern Bengal and Assam. In Muhammadan histories the term is used for a smaller area, comprising the east of the Punjab and R\u0101jput\u0101na and the greater part of the United Provinces. Thus Abul Fazl treated the province of Lahore as outside of Hindust\u0101n. During the eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth centuries the term Hindust\u0101n was loosely employed by geographers to include the whole of India. The name means the \u2018place of the Hindus\u2019; and it has been applied to the lingua franca of Northern India, called Hindust\u0101ni or Urd\u016b, which is a dialect of\nWestern Hindi, with a greater or less admixture of Arabic and Persian vocables, according to the taste of the speaker.\n\n**Hingangh\u0101t Tahsil.**\u2014Southern tahsil of Wardh\u0101 District, Central Provinces, lying between $20^\\circ 18'$ and $20^\\circ 49'$ N. and $78^\\circ 32'$ and $79^\\circ 14'$ E., with an area of 729 square miles. The population in 1901 was 94,801, compared with 111,465 in 1891. The density is 130 persons per square mile. The tahsil contains one town, Hingangh\u0101t (population, 12,662), the head-quarters; and 207 inhabited villages. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,86,000, and for cesses Rs. 19,000. Hingangh\u0101t has a larger proportion of the spring crops, wheat and linseed, than the rest of the District. The local variety of cotton, called after the name of the town, was formerly well-known, but the seed has now become mixed with inferior varieties, and the quality has deteriorated. Excluding 17 square miles of Government forest, 88 per cent. of the available area is occupied for cultivation. The cultivated area in 1903\u20134 was 540 square miles. The tahsil consists of an undulating plain of fertile black soil.\n\n**Hingangh\u0101t Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name, Wardh\u0101 District, Central Provinces, situated in $20^\\circ 34'$ N. and $78^\\circ 51'$ E., on the Wunn\u0101 river, and on the Wardh\u0101-Waror\u0101 branch line of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, 21 miles from Wardh\u0101 town and 492 from Bombay. Population (1901), 12,662. An outbreak of plague in 1898 has not affected its prosperity. The name means the gh\u0101\u1e6d or crossing of the hingan-trees (*Balanites aegyptiaca*). Old Hingangh\u0101t was a straggling ill-arranged town, liable to be flooded by the Wunn\u0101 river during the monsoon. The new town, a quarter of a mile distant from the old one, is laid out in two sets of three broad streets at right angles to each other, and furnished with rows of trees like boulevards. Hingangh\u0101t was created a municipality in 1867. The receipts and expenditure during the decade ending 1900 averaged Rs. 35,000. By 1903\u20134 the income had largely expanded, and amounted to Rs. 70,000, octroi being the principal head of receipt. The town is a leading centre of the cotton-trade. The Hingangh\u0101t Mill Company, established in 1881, has a capital of 3.5 lakhs and 30,888 spindles. Another mill, with nearly 15,000 spindles and 160 looms, which began work in 1900, is the sole property of a resident of Hingangh\u0101t, who has invested 13 lakhs in it. There are also 10 cotton-ginning factories, and 4 pressing factories, containing 265 gins and 2 presses, with an aggregate capital of about 7 lakhs. The town is supplied with water from the Wunn\u0101 river. A filtration well has been sunk in the bed of the river at a distance of about two miles, from which water is pumped into an elevated reservoir and distributed to the urban area in pipes. The works were opened in 1883, the capital expenditure being 1.36 lakhs, and the\nannual maintenance charges Rs. 8,000. Hingangh\u0101t has a high school and a dispensary, and a town hall has recently been built. Other large public improvements likely to be completed in the immediate future are the improvement and extension of the water-works and the construction of a market.\n\n**Hingl\u0101j.** The best-known place of pilgrimage in Baluchist\u0101n, situated in $25^\\circ 30' N.$ and $65^\\circ 31' E.$, below the peak of the same name on the banks of the Hingol river in the Las Bela State. The shrine, which is dedicated to a goddess known as N\u0101ni by Muhammadans and P\u0101rbat\u012b, K\u0101li, or M\u0101ta by Hindus, lies in a verdant basin and consists of a low castellated mud edifice in a natural cavity. A flight of steps leads to a deeper semicircular cleft through which pilgrims creep on all fours. Bands of pilgrims, each conducted by a leader known as an *ag\u0101v\u0101*, make the journey by land from Kar\u0101chi. Fees are collected at Mi\u0101ni by a *bh\u0101rti* or hereditary examiner, on behalf of the Las Bela officials, from all except devotees and unmarried girls. The proceeds yield about Rs. 600 to the State annually.\n\n**Hingol.**\u2014The largest river in Baluchist\u0101n, 358 miles long. It rises at the head of the valley of S\u016br\u0101b, and drains the western side of the Jhalaw\u0101n country and the north-eastern part of Makr\u0101n. The Hingol is known by a variety of names: as the Rej in S\u016br\u0101b, as the Gidar Dhor in the Gidar valley, and as the N\u0101l Kaur in the central part of its course. Its principal affluents join it in the south. They are the Mashkai, which meets the main stream under the name of the Pao, and the Arra. The Mashkai drains a very large area, including the Mashkai, R\u0101ghai, and Gichk valleys. There is no continuous flow of water in the upper part of the course of the Hingol; it meanders through stony valleys, the water being utilized wherever possible for cultivation, and constantly disappears in underground channels. From Kurragi in Jau downwards the supply becomes perennial. Thence the river passes through a series of magnificent but narrow gorges, and falls into the Arabian Sea in $25^\\circ 23' N.$ and $65^\\circ 28' E.$ Near its mouth is the celebrated shrine of Hingl\u0101j.\n\n**Hingoli T\u0101luk.**\u2014North-eastern t\u0101luk of Parbhani District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 713 square miles. Including j\u0101girs, the population in 1901 was 85,071, compared with 108,153 in 1891, the decrease being due to the famine of 1900. The t\u0101luk contains one town, Hingoli (population, 17,256), the head-quarters; and 209 villages, of which 19 are j\u0101gir. The land revenue in 1901 was 1\u00b79 lakhs. The Pengang\u0101 river separates it on the north and north-east from the B\u0101sim District of Ber\u0101r. The soils are mainly regar and alluvial.\n\n**Hingoli Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk of the same name in Parbhani District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in $19^\\circ 43' N.$ and $77^\\circ 9' E.$ Population (1901), 17,256, of whom 11,395 are Hindus, 5,289 Musal-\nm\u0101ns, and 52 Christians. It contains three schools with 230 pupils, of which one is a middle school, and one a girls' school. It is also the head-quarters of the Second T\u0101lukd\u0101r, and contains a State post office and a British sub-post office, a Munsif's court, a dispensary, two ginning factories, and a cotton-press. It was a cantonment of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d Contingent up to 1903. Since the removal of the Contingent, some of the Niz\u0101m's troops have been stationed here. Hingoli is a great cotton mart, and is famous as one of the first places in the Deccan at which operations for the suppression of thagi were commenced about 1833. Fourteen miles south-west of Hingoli is the village of Aundah, containing the ruins of an immense temple destroyed by Aurangzeb. The carvings in the basement are of a very elaborate description, resembling those on the temple of Kail\u0101s at Ellora.\n\nHir\u0101pur.\u2014Thakur\u016bt in the Bhop\u0101l Agency, Central India.\n\nHirekal Gudda.\u2014A group of hills in the Arsikere t\u0101luk of Hassan District, Mysore State, lying between 13\u00b0 20' and 13\u00b0 28' N. and 76\u00b0 19' and 76\u00b0 23' E. At the southern end is the temple of M\u0101lekal Tirupati. Conspicuous towards the north is Garudangiri (3,680 feet), crowned with a fort built by the R\u0101j\u0101 of Mysore in 1660. In 1770 it was occupied for a time by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, but reverted to Mysore.\n\nHiremugal\u016br.\u2014Village in the Chikmugal\u016br t\u0101luk of Kad\u016br District, Mysore, situated in 13\u00b0 18' N. and 75\u00b0 48' E., one mile from Chikmugal\u016br town. Population (1901), 2,392. Its Pur\u0101nic name is Bh\u0101rgavapuri, and here the emperor Janamejaya is said to have performed the sarpa-y\u0101ga or 'serpent sacrifice,' to revenge the death of his father Parikshit from the bite of a serpent. A spear-headed stone pillar is shown as the yupa-stambha or 'sacrificial post' used at the ceremony. Any one bitten by a snake will be cured by going round it and bathing in the pond close by. The village is surrounded by rich black soil. Inscriptions show that it was an agrah\u0101ra under the Gangas in the ninth century, and under the Hoysalas in the eleventh. It contains a temple to Parasu, the axe of Parasu R\u0101ma.\n\nHiriy\u016br.\u2014South-eastern t\u0101luk of Chitaldroog District, Mysore, lying between 13\u00b0 41' and 14\u00b0 12' N. and 76\u00b0 26' and 76\u00b0 57' E., with an area of 635 square miles. The population in 1901 was 66,290, compared with 45,974 in 1891. After the reconstruction of the t\u0101luk in 1903 the population was 48,464. The t\u0101luk contains one town, Hiriy\u016br (population, 2,213), the head-quarters; and 152 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 57,000. The south-west is crossed by parallel ranges of low rocky hills. Through a gorge called the M\u0101ri Kanave in these hills the Ved\u0101vati flows north-east across the centre of the t\u0101luk to some distance beyond Hiriy\u016br, where it receives a considerable stream from the south, and turns north. The south-west is peculiarly barren in appearance, being covered with masses of hills,\nscantily clothed with jungle and generally capped with black rock. No gardens or tanks relieve the harshness of the landscape. Everywhere stones cover the ground, even in the fields. These hills are included in the auriferous Chiknayakanhalli band. In the north-west, Ayamangala is a flat and stony country, but contains much black soil. The rest of the t\u016bluk is separated by an abrupt and decided line, nearly identical with the Hiriyur-Bangalore high road, north of which is black soil, and south of it red, but stony and broken. Jola and cotton are the principal products of the black soil, r\u0101gi and avare of the red. Iron is smelted at Arsingundi, Chikka By\u0101ladakere, and other villages, there being a large manufacture of shoes for bullocks and horses at the latter. At Mattod are glass-works, formerly very extensive, occupied in making glass bangles for women.\n\n**Hiss\u0101r District (His\u0101r).**\u2014District in the Delhi Division of the Punjab, lying between 28\u00b0 36' and 30\u00b0 N. and 74\u00b0 29' and 76\u00b0 20' E., with an area of 5,217 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Ferozepore District, and by the State of Pati\u0101la; on the east by the Jind niz\u0101mat of Jind State, and by the District of Rohtak; on the south by the D\u0101dri niz\u0101mat of Jind, and the territory of the Naw\u0101b of Loh\u0101ru; and on the south-west by the State of Bikaner. Situated on the borders of the Bikaner desert, it has in many respects the characteristics of R\u0101jput\u0101na rather than of the Punjab; its general aspect is that of a plain or prairie, unbroken except by some detached peaks of the Ar\u0101valli range in the extreme south-west, the highest of which is Tosh\u0101m hill with an elevation of 800 feet. The only river, the Ghaggar, enters the District in two branches, known as the Ghaggar and Johiya, meeting below Sirsa.\n\nWith the exception of some small outliers of gneiss at Tosh\u0101m, there is nothing of geological interest in the District, which is otherwise entirely of alluvial formation.\n\nThe north-eastern part resembles as regards its vegetation the upper Gangetic plain, while the southern border is botanically akin to R\u0101jput\u0101na. The Sirsa subdivision resembles the desert and the Western Punjab. The fodder-grasses of the tracts round Hiss\u0101r and H\u0101nsi (largely species of *Panicum* and *Pennisetum*) are celebrated. A stunted kind of zizyphus (*Z. mummularia*), common in the drier tracts of Northern India, is conspicuous in this District, and its leaves are valued locally for cattle.\n\nWild animals are comparatively rare, owing to the absence of water, but antelope and 'ravine deer' (gazelle) are common, and hog are plentiful in parts. Wolves are also fairly numerous. *Nilgai* are sometimes met with near Hiss\u0101r.\n\nOwing to the extreme dryness of the climate, the District is healthy.\nEven the canal-irrigated tracts, where there used to be a great deal of fever and the people presented a striking contrast to the inhabitants of the dry region, have been healthy since the cultivation of rice was stopped about ten years ago. Both the heat in summer and the cold in winter are extreme, and epidemics of pneumonia are not uncommon in the winter months.\n\nAs the District lies on the edges of both the Bengal and Bombay monsoon currents, the most striking feature in the rainfall is its extreme variability, and the partial manner in which it is distributed. The yearly average varies from 14 inches at Sirsa to 16 at Hissar, where 14 inches fall in the summer and 2 in the winter. The greatest annual rainfall recorded during the last twenty years was 37.4 inches at Bhiwani in 1885\u20136, and the least 3.1 inches at Sirsa in 1899\u20131900.\n\nA large part of the District is, with parts of Rohtak, better known to history as HARIANA. The once fertile tract watered by the Ghaggar had its capital at Hansi, which was the ancient capital and southernmost point of the Siwalik territory, and which archaeological investigations show to be one of the oldest towns in India. The numerous architectural remains of Hindu origin, found built into the walls of Muhammadan tombs and mosques throughout the District, testify to its having been the abode of an ancient and vigorous Hindu civilization. The most interesting of these are to be found at HISSAR, HANSI, FATIHABAD, and TOSHAM. An inscription at Tosham seems to commemorate a victory over Ghatotkacha, the second known member of the Gupta line (circa A.D. 305), and it appears probable that Hansi was a stronghold of the Kushan rulers of the Punjab.\n\nThe District is said to have been overrun in the eighth century by the Tomar Rajputs, and afterwards to have fallen under the dominion of the Chauhans. In 1036 Hansi was captured by Masaud, son of Mahmud of Ghazni; but in 1043 it was retaken by the Delhi Raja, probably a Tomar vassal of the Chauhans. After the defeat of Prithvi Raja by Muhammad of Ghor in 1192, the Jats laid siege to Hansi, but were defeated by Kutb-ud-din. Hansi then became a fief of the Delhi kingdom. The districts of Delhi, Ajmer, Hansi, and Sirsa fell into the hands of the conqueror; but no settled rule seems to have been at first established in this tract, which in the ensuing anarchy was dominated by the Jat Rajputs, an offshoot of the Tomars. Muhammadan power was, however, gradually consolidated; and about 1254, in the reign of Mahmud Shah I, the District, including Hansi, Sirsa, Barwala, and Jind, was assigned as a fief to Ulugh Khan-i-Azam, afterwards the emperor Balban.\n\nUntil the eighteenth century the tract remained a flourishing division of the Muhammadan empire, and Sirsa or Sarsuti was in the fourteenth\ncentury, according to Wass\u0101f, one of the most important towns in Upper India. The towns of Fatah\u0101b\u0101d and Hiss\u0101r were founded in 1352 and 1356 respectively by Firoz Sh\u0101h III, and canals were dug from the Ghaggar and Jumna for their use. After the capture of Bhatner, Tim\u016br marched through the District via Sirsa, Fatah\u0101b\u0101d, Rajabpur, Ahr\u016bni, and Toh\u0101na. It is evident from his account that these towns were wealthy and prosperous, for he took much booty in Sirsa, Fatah\u0101b\u0101d, and Ahr\u016bni, and drove the J\u0101ts of Toh\u0101na into their sugar-cane fields and jungles.\n\nDuring the eighteenth century the country appears to have been held by Muhammadan tribes claiming R\u0101jput origin, of whom the chief were the Johiyas round Bhatner (HANUM\u0100NGARH) and the Bhattis about R\u0101nia, Sirsa, and Fatah\u0101b\u0101d, from whom the western part of the District took its name of BHATTI\u0100NA. The Bikaner annals tell of the incessant struggles of the Hindu R\u0101jputs of that State with the Johiyas and Bhattis for the possession of Bhatner and sometimes of Sirsa; and the chronicles of Pati\u0101la are full of raids and counter-raids between the Sikh Jats and their hereditary foes, the Bhattis. On the death of Aurangzeb in 1707 we find Naw\u0101b Sh\u0101h D\u0101d Kh\u0101n, a Path\u0101n of Kas\u016br, n\u0101zm of the sark\u0101r of Hiss\u0101r: and under his rule, from 1707 to 1737, the people and country appear to have prospered exceedingly. He was succeeded by the Naw\u0101bs of Farrukhnagar, in Gurgaon, who ruled till 1761. But N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h ravaged the land in 1739: and with the disintegration of the Delhi empire Hiss\u0101r became the scene of a sanguinary struggle between the Sikhs of the north-east, the marauding Bhattis of the north and north-west, and the imperial power of Delhi. In 1731 Ala Singh, the founder of the Pati\u0101la State, had already commenced a struggle with the Bhatti chiefs of Bhatner and Fatah\u0101b\u0101d which lasted during his lifetime: the Bhattis, though supported by imperial troops, were defeated in 1754 and 1757, and Hiss\u0101r was sacked in 1757 and Toh\u0101na in 1761. In the latter year Naw\u0101b Am\u012bn Kh\u0101n, the Bhatti chief of R\u0101nia, was appointed n\u0101zm of Hiss\u0101r; but he had no better fortune, and by 1774 Amar Singh, successor of Ala Singh, had become master of the whole of the H\u0101nsi, Hiss\u0101r, and Sirsa territories. On Amar Singh\u2019s death in 1781, an agreement was made whereby Hiss\u0101r, H\u0101nsi, Tosh\u0101m, Rohtak, and Maham were assigned to the empire, Sirsa and Fatah\u0101bad to the Bhattis, and the rest of their conquests to the Sikhs: but the great famine of 1783, which entirely devastated the District, compelled the latter to retire to their own country. The territories thus left derelict were in 1797 occupied by the adventurer George Thomas, who for three years maintained an independent kingdom in H\u0101nsi and Hiss\u0101r. However in 1802, after an obstinate defence of H\u0101nsi, he surrendered to an army under Bourquin sent against him by Perron, Sindhia\u2019s\nFrench general; and the country was for a brief space under the Mar\u0101th\u0101 dominion.\n\nIn 1803 Hiss\u0101r and Sirsa, with the territories ceded by Sindhia, passed nominally to the British; but although a military post was maintained at H\u0101nsi, and n\u0101zims or native superintendents were placed in civil charge, little was done towards enforcing order until 1810, when an expedition was rendered necessary by the continued raids of the Bhatti chiefs. In consequence of these the territory of Faizah\u0101b\u0101d was annexed, and a second expedition in 1818 secured the rest of the territory held by the Bhattis. Thus the whole of the Sirsa tahsil was brought under British rule. Most of the present District was in 1820 included in the Western District of the Delhi territory. During the years that followed, the Sikh R\u0101j\u0101s, taking advantage of British neglect and the waste condition of the dry tract beyond the Ghaggar, began a series of irregular colonizations, which continued uninterrupted till 1837. The British Government, after a long boundary contention with Patiala, asserted its supremacy over the dry tract, which was resumed, and, together with the valley of the Ghaggar, made into a separate District under the name of Bhatti\u0101na, in which all the present tahsil of Sirsa was included. Additions were made to the territory by other resumptions from encroaching Native States in 1844, 1847, and 1855.\n\nIn the Mutiny of 1857 the troops at H\u0101nsi were the first to rise, followed by those at Hiss\u0101r and Sirsa: all Europeans who did not fly were murdered, and Hiss\u0101r and Sirsa were wholly lost for a time to British rule. The Ranghars and Pachh\u0101das of Hiss\u0101r and the Bhattis of Sirsa, followed by the majority of the Muhammadan villagers, rose in insurrection; but before Delhi had been recovered a force of Punjab levies, aided by contingents from Patiala and Bikaner, under General van Cortlandt, utterly routed them. After the Mutiny Hiss\u0101r and Bhatti\u0101na Districts were transferred from the North-Western Provinces to the Punjab, and the latter became the Sirsa District. In 1884 that District was broken up; the Sirsa tahsil and 126 villages of Dabw\u0101li were transferred to Hiss\u0101r, while F\u0101zilka and the remaining 31 villages of Dabw\u0101li were amalgamated with Ferozepore District. The small Budhl\u0101da tract was transferred from Karn\u0101l to Hiss\u0101r in 1889. In 1904 two villages of the District were transferred, with a cash payment of Rs. 25,000, to the Bikaner State, in exchange for a few villages held by the Darb\u0101r in the Deccan.\n\nHiss\u0101r contains 8 towns and 964 villages. Its population at each of the last three enumerations was: (1881) 672,560, (1891) 776,006, and (1901) 781,717. It increased by less than 7 per cent. during the last decade, the low rate being chiefly due to emigration during the famine years of 1897 and 1900.\nThe District is divided into the five tahsils of Hissar, Hansi, Bhiwani, Fatehabad, and Sirsa, the head-quarters of each being at the place from which it is named. The chief towns are the municipalities of Bhiwani, Hansi, Hissar, and Sirsa, Hissar being the head-quarters of the District.\n\nThe following table shows the distribution of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|--------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Hissar | 810                 | 1              | 134      | 128,783    | 159.0                     | + 5.3                                           | 3,563                             |\n| Hansi  | 799                 | 1              | 132      | 178,933    | 224.0                     | + 8.0                                           | 4,283                             |\n| Bhiwani| 750                 | 1              | 131      | 124,429    | 165.9                     | - 2.6                                           | 5,585                             |\n| Fatehabad | 1,179             | 1              | 261      | 190,921    | 161.9                     | + 5.1                                           | 3,218                             |\n| Sirsa  | 1,051               | 4              | 36       | 158,651    | 96.1                      | - 11.2                                          | 4,722                             |\n\nDistrict total | 5,217* | 8 | 964 | 781,717 | 149.8 | + 0.7 | 21,371 |\n\n* The only figures available for the areas of tahsils are those derived from the revenue returns, and the tahsil densities have been calculated on the areas given in the revenue returns for 1900. These returns do not always cover the whole of the country comprised in a tahsil, and hence the total of the tahsil areas does not agree with the District area as shown in the Census Report of 1901, in the table above, and on p. 144, which is the complete area as calculated by the Survey department. The tracts not included in the revenue survey are as a rule uninhabited or very sparsely populated.\n\nHindus number 544,799, or more than 70 per cent. of the total, Muhammadans 202,009, and Sikhs 28,642. Owing to the large areas of sandy soil, the density of the population is only 150 persons per square mile, and even on the cultivated area it is only 194, the precarious nature of the cultivation forbidding it to support more. The vernaculars are Hari\u0101ni, B\u0101ngru or Desw\u0101li in the south, Punj\u0101bi in the north, and B\u0101gri in the south-east. B\u0101gri and Hari\u0101ni run very much into one another; to a less extent Punj\u0101bi blends with Hindi and B\u0101gri through Pachh\u0101di, the Punj\u0101bi dialect of the Muhammadan Pachh\u0101das.\n\nMost important of the land-owning tribes are the J\u0101ts or Jats, who number 195,000, and comprise one-fourth of the population. They may roughly be divided into four classes: the Desw\u0101li J\u0101ts of Hari\u0101na, some of whose ancestors appear to have inhabited the District in ancient times; the B\u0101gri J\u0101ts, immigrants from the B\u0101gar country of Bikaner; the Sikh J\u0101ts of Sirsa, who came from the M\u0101lw\u0101 country and from Patiala; and the Muhammadan J\u0101ts, who form part of the nondescript collection of tribes known as Pachh\u0101das. The Desw\u0101li and B\u0101gri J\u0101ts are practically all Hindus and intermarry. The R\u0101jputs number 70,000, or 9 per cent. of the population; three-fourths of them are Muhammadans. The oldest clan is the Tonwar or Tomar, who first entered the District during the ascendancy of the Tomar dynasty.\nunder Anang P\u0101l at Delhi. Other important clans are the J\u0101tu, Bhatti, Wattu, Johiya, Chauh\u0101n, Ponw\u0101r, and R\u0101thor. As a rule the R\u0101jput, retaining the military traditions of his ancestors, is a lazy and inefficient agriculturist, somewhat prone to cattle-stealing. The Pachh\u0101das (30,000), as they are termed by others, are a congeries of Muhammadan tribes, many of which claim to be R\u0101jputs, though the claim rests on but slender evidence. Their name and tradition point to their having come from the west (pachhim), and their facial type suggests a connexion with the tribes of the Western Punjab. They are indifferent agriculturists, lazy, improvident, and sometimes cattle-thieves; in physique inferior to the Desw\u0101li and Sikh J\u0101ts, though perhaps superior to the B\u0101gri. The M\u0101lis, chiefly market gardeners (13,000), are entirely Hindu, the Arains (5,000) Muhammadan; Br\u0101hmans (43,000) are chiefly Gaur, S\u0101rsut, Kh\u0101ndelw\u0101l, Dahm\u012ba, Gujar\u0101ti, Ach\u0101rj, and Cham\u0101rwa in order of status. The great majority of the Gaur and S\u0101rsut Br\u0101hmans are agriculturists, but all are fed on various occasions and venerated, though disliked. Pushkarna Br\u0101hmans from Ajmer are also found. Of the commercial classes the most important is that of the Bani\u0101s (61,000), who are divided into three subdivisions\u2014Agarw\u0101l, Osw\u0101l, and Mahesri\u2014who neither smoke, eat, nor intermarry with each other. Of artisan and menial tribes may be noted the Ahirs (10,000), a vagrant tribe who claim R\u0101jput origin, the Tarkh\u0101ns, carpenters (20,000), the Loh\u0101rs or blacksmiths (10,000), the Cham\u0101rs or leather-workers (69,000), the Dh\u0101nakas (20,000), and the Ch\u016bhr\u0101s or scavengers (25,000). Of the total population of the District, 72 per cent. are agricultural, and practically the whole of the rural population is dependent on agriculture.\n\nTwo lady missionary doctors are stationed at Bhiw\u0101ni, where the Baptist Mission of Delhi maintains a girls\u2019 school. The District is also visited by missionaries of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel from Delhi. In 1901 it contained 53 native Christians.\n\nThe District is divided into four natural tracts. Of these, the Rohi of the Sirsa tahsil stretches from the northern boundary to the Ghaggar. Its soil is a soft loam with a reddish tinge, interspersed with sand and clay; the spring-level in the wells varies from 40 to 180 feet, the crops depend entirely on rainfall, and vegetation is sparse. South of the Rohi lies the western extremity of the N\u0101li tract, stretching from east to west through the Fatah\u0101bad and Sirsa tahsils, and traversed by the Ghaggar and Johiya. Its characteristic feature is a hard iron-clay soil, which permits of no cultivation until well saturated by the summer floods. Here the harvest depends on inundation from the Ghaggar and Johiya, helped in some parts by well-irrigation. The B\u0101gar tract stretches from the south and south-west of Sirsa along the western border of the District, through Agriculture.\nSirsa, Fatahab\u0101d, Hiss\u0101r, and Bhiw\u0101ni, gradually widening towards the south. Here the prevailing features are a light sandy soil and shifting sandhills, interspersed in parts with firmer and even loamy bottoms; the spring-level is more than 100 feet below the surface, and the water frequently bitter. Practically the autumn crop is the only one sown, and that depends entirely on a sufficient rainfall. The Hari\u0101na tract stretches from the tract watered by the Ghaggar to the south-east corner of the District; it comprises the whole of H\u0101nsi and the eastern portions of Fatahab\u0101d, Hiss\u0101r, and Bhiw\u0101ni, and is traversed by the Western Jumna Canal. The leading feature of this tract is its firm clay soil; sandhills are found, and in low-lying parts hard clayey soil. The spring-level is generally below 100 feet, except in canal villages, where it rises to 30 or 40 feet. Apart from the canal tract, agriculture is practically confined to the autumn crop. The small jungle tract of Budhl\u0101da, consisting of 15 outlying villages in the north of the Fatahab\u0101d tal\u016bk, is sometimes classed as a fifth tract, but resembles the Rohi. Taking the District as a whole, only 9 per cent. of the cultivation is irrigated, and the rainfall is therefore of the utmost importance; on the rain of June and July depend the sowings of all the autumn crops, and on that of August and September the ripening of the autumn and the sowing of the spring crops. Until recently the autumn harvest was the mainstay of the District; but of late years, owing to the good prices obtained for wheat, the spring harvest has taken the leading place, and the best season is one in which there is heavy rain at the end of August and all through September.\n\nThe area for which details are available from the revenue records of 1903\u20134 is 5,180 square miles, as shown below:\n\n| Tahsil | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----------|----------------|\n| Hiss\u0101r | 810   | 623        | 53        | 98             |\n| H\u0101nsi  | 799   | 690        | 180       | 60             |\n| Bhiw\u0101ni| 750   | 603        | 6         | 110            |\n| Fatahab\u0101d | 1,179 | 1,300     | 69        | 165            |\n| Sirsa  | 1,642 | 945        | 75        | 300            |\n| **Total** | **5,180** | **4,161** | **383** | **733** |\n\nThe principal staples of the spring harvest are gram and barley, the areas under which in 1903\u20134 were 478 and 168 square miles respectively. Wheat covered only 109 square miles. The chief food-grain of the autumn harvest is spiked millet, which occupied 929 square miles. Great millet comes next with 381 square miles, and then pulses with 175. Practically all the sugar-cane and cotton grown is irrigated, with four-fifths of the maize, three-fifths of the rice, and two-fifths of the wheat. No other crop is irrigated to any appreciable extent.\nThe cultivation of rice has of late years been prohibited in canal lands, and its place largely taken by cotton. Experiments are being carried on chiefly with the object of introducing cotton of a longer staple. There is great room for improvement in the methods adopted by the people for utilizing the canal water at their disposal.\n\nLarge advances are given both under the Land Improvement Loans Act for digging and clearing wells, and under the Agriculturists' Loans Act for the purchase of bullocks and seed. During the five years ending September, 1904, a total of Rs. 73,000 was advanced under the former and 18 lakhs under the latter Act, of which Rs. 43,627 and 10.5 lakhs respectively was advanced during the famine year 1899-1900.\n\nHari\u0101na was always famous for its cattle, which were the chief support of its former pastoral inhabitants. The breed is still good, though cattle-breeding is somewhat on the wane owing to the spread of cultivation. The Hiss\u0101r Government cattle farm was started in 1813, and now covers 66 square miles. The pure breeds of cattle maintained are the Gujar\u0101ti, Ungoli, Nagaur, and Mysore, which are also crossed with Hari\u0101na cows. Of late years mule-breeding has been commenced. Large cattle fairs are held at Hiss\u0101r and Sirsa, at which it is estimated that animals of the total value of 6\u00bd lakhs are sold annually. The camel is used in all parts for riding and carrying loads, and where the soil is light does a large part of the ploughing. The local breed of horses is in no way above the average. The District board maintains 5 horse and 4 donkey stallions.\n\nOf the total area cultivated in 1903-4, 383 square miles, or nearly 9 per cent., were classed as irrigated. Of this area, 6 square miles were irrigated from wells and 377 from canals. In addition 83 square miles, or 2 per cent., are subject to inundation from the Ghaggar and other streams. The H\u0101nsi branch of the Western Jumna Canal irrigates the H\u0101nsi, Hiss\u0101r, and Bhiw\u0101ni tahsils, while the Sirsa branch irrigates parts of Fatah\u0101b\u0101d, Hiss\u0101r, and Sirsa. The Ghaggar Canals supply part of the Sirsa tahsil, and the Budhl\u0101da tract and a portion of Sirsa are watered by the Sirhind Canal. The area under canal-irrigation increased from 120 square miles in 1891 to 377 in 1904. The area supplied by wells is insignificant, owing to the great depth to water, and the chief use of well-irrigation is to enable sowings to be made for the spring harvest. The total number of wells in use for irrigation was only 854 in 1903-4, all being worked by cattle on the rope and bucket system.\n\nThe greater part of the cattle farm, known as the Hiss\u0101r Bir, is a 'reserved' forest, measuring 65 square miles, under the Civil Veterinary department, the income from which in 1903-4 was Rs. 4,379. The Bir at H\u0101nsi is an unclassed forest under the same department. Three pieces of grazing-ground are managed by the Deputy-Com-\nmissioner at Hiss\u0101r, Sirsa, and H\u0101nsi for the town cattle. The total area of forest land is: 'reserved,' 65 square miles; and unclassed, 5 square miles. Trees have been extensively planted with the aid of canal water by the District board in and around the civil station of Hiss\u0101r and the town of H\u0101nsi, and the B\u012br at H\u0101nsi is also being planted with trees to make a fuel reserve.\n\nKankar or calcareous limestone is found in many localities. Saltpetre is manufactured from saline earth in the villages, and refined in the licensed refineries at Bhiw\u0101ni, H\u0101nsi, and Sirsa.\n\nThe District has no manufactures of importance. Coarse cotton cloth is woven almost everywhere; and there are 10 cotton-ginning factories, 3 cotton presses, and 3 factories where ginning and pressing are combined. H\u0101nsi is the industrial centre, but four of the factories are at Bhiw\u0101ni, and one at Narnaund, while the cotton-ginning and pressing factory of a native firm at Hiss\u0101r is the largest in the District. These industries employed a total of 2,061 hands in 1904. Bhiw\u0101ni is known for its plain brass and bell-metal work, and for its carved doors. The District produces cotton phulk\u0101ris embroidered with silk, which are of exceptional excellence, and embroidered woollen phulk\u0101ris are also made. The carpenters' work is above the average.\n\nThe chief centres of trade are Bhiw\u0101ni, H\u0101nsi, Hiss\u0101r, Budhl\u0101da, and Sirsa on the railway; but a good deal of local trade does not pass through these places, being brought direct to the consumers by individual speculators, generally Bishnoi or B\u0101gri J\u0101ts. Hiss\u0101r town and H\u0101nsi are chiefly distributing centres for local requirements; but Bhiw\u0101ni and Sirsa are important as centres of through trade to R\u0101jput\u0101na, wheat, flour, sugar, and cotton goods being largely exported.\n\nThe Rew\u0101ri-Bhatinda branch of the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway runs through the District for 122 miles, while the Southern Punjab Railway passes through Budhl\u0101da, J\u0101khal, and Toh\u0101na, and the Jodhpur-Bikaner Railway runs through part of Sirsa tahsil. The District has 26 miles of metalled and 9.49 of unmetalled roads, of which 17 miles of metalled and 90 of unmetalled roads are under the Public Works department and the rest under the District board. The unmetalled roads are fit for cart traffic, except in the sandy tracts where camels are used. The H\u0101nsi branch of the Western Jumna Canal is navigable as far as H\u0101nsi.\n\nHiss\u0101r has always been most liable to famine of all the Districts of the Punjab, owing to the fact that, while pre-eminently dependent on the autumn harvest and very little protected by irrigation, it suffers from a most capricious monsoon, and also receives the first rush of starving wanderers from Bikaner.\nThe ch\u0101lisa famine of 1782\u20133, as has been related, laid waste the District; and in all the famines that have since visited the Punjab, Hiss\u0101r has always suffered in a pre-eminent degree. Both in 1896\u20137 and in 1899\u20131900 the whole of the unirrigated area, or 3,763 square miles, was affected. In 1896\u20137 the greatest number relieved on any one day was 82,505 persons, and the highest death-rate in any one week 81 per 1,000. The amount expended by Government was 12\u00b73 lakhs in 1896\u20137, and 25\u00b77 lakhs in 1899\u20131900. The severity of the famine of 1899\u20131900 was accentuated by the fact that the people had not recovered from the preceding famine.\n\nThe District is in charge of a Deputy-Commissioner, assisted by three Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioners, of whom one is in charge of the Sirsa tahsil and subdivision. Each of the five tahsils is in charge of a tahsild\u0101r, assisted by a naib-tahsild\u0101r. Dabw\u0101li in Sirsa and Toh\u0101na in Fatah\u0101b\u0101d are sub-tahsils under naib-tahsild\u0101rs.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner as District Magistrate is responsible for the criminal justice of the District. Civil judicial work is under a District Judge. Both officers are supervised by the Divisional Judge of Ferozepore. The District Judge has a Munsif under him at head-quarters, and there are four honorary magistrates. Cattle-theft is the principal crime of the District, for which its position, surrounded by Native States, affords peculiar facilities. It is practised chiefly by the Muhammadan R\u0101jputs and Pachh\u0101das.\n\nThe revenue history of Hiss\u0101r proper is quite distinct from that of the Sirsa tahsil, which was only added to the District on the disruption of the old Sirsa District in 1884. The greater part of Hiss\u0101r was occupied by the British in 1810, and underwent three summary settlements for ten, five, and ten years between 1815 and 1840. The main feature of these assessments was a demand so high that full collections were the exception, and the frequent remissions demoralized both the revenue officials and the people. A rush of immigrants had taken place on the establishment of settled government; and when disturbances occurred in the neighbouring Native States, Hiss\u0101r formed a convenient refuge. The land revenue, however, was fixed and collected with such a complete disregard of the chances of bad seasons, that when the cultivators were pressed for payment they moved off into the Native States whence they had come. The demand of the first settlement (1815\u201325) was so high that it exceeded by 20 per cent. the revenue fixed in 1890 for the same villages. High though this assessment was, it was increased in the two settlements that followed, until between 1835 and 1839 the demand was 4\u00b79 lakhs for a tract which in 1890 was assessed at only about two-thirds of that sum.\n\nThe amount fixed at the regular settlement of 1840 was 37 per cent.\nbelow the old demand. The canal villages were assessed at irrigated rates for the first time in 1839. The reduction came as a new lease of life to the impoverished landholders, and the progress made since has been steady, interrupted only by famine. A revised settlement was made in 1863, which resulted in a further reduction of half a lakh. The second revised settlement was carried out between 1887 and 1892. Cultivation had more than doubled, while prices had risen 60 per cent., and the result was an increase of 58 per cent. to 6 lakhs. The rates varied from 3 to 8 annas an acre, exclusive of canal rates. About 90 per cent. of the tenants pay rent in cash.\n\nThe Sirsa tahsil, with the rest of the old Sirsa District, was summarily settled in 1829 and regularly in 1851. In 1881-2, the last year of the regular settlement, the demand stood at 1.4 lakhs, which was raised by the new assessment to 1.9 lakhs. The assessment was revised for the second time between 1901 and 1903, and a fixed assessment of 2 lakhs was announced. The area subject to the very precarious Ghaggar floods was placed under fluctuating assessment, fixed rates for the various crops grown being applied to the area actually cropped every harvest. It is estimated that the yield from this fluctuating assessment will be Rs. 39,000 per annum.\n\nThe collections of land revenue alone and of total revenue are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 4.26   | 7.60   | 6.48   | 8.09   |\n| Total revenue  | 5.08   | 9.95   | 9.99   | 11.90  |\n\nThe District contains four municipalities, HISSAR, HANSI, BHIWANI, and SIRSA; and three notified areas, FATAHABAD, TOHANA, and Budhlada. Outside these, local affairs are managed by the District board, whose income amounted in 1903-4 to 1\u00bc lakhs. The expenditure in the same year was 1.3 lakhs, education and public works forming the principal items.\n\nThe regular police force consists of 681 of all ranks, including 180 municipal police, under a Superintendent who is usually assisted by 4 inspectors. The village watchmen number 1,474, and 42 chaukidars are directly under the Superintendent. There are 19 police stations, 4 outposts, and 6 road-posts. The District jail at head-quarters has accommodation for 252 prisoners.\n\nThe District stands twenty-fifth among the twenty-eight Districts of the Province in respect of the literacy of its population. In 1901 the proportion of literate persons was 2.7 per cent. (5 males and 0.1 females). The number of pupils under instruction was 1,753 in 1880-1, 3,568\n\n1 For the District as then constituted.\nin 1890-1, 3,803 in 1900-1, and 4,258 in 1903-4. In the last year there were 6 secondary and 73 primary (public) schools, and 3 advanced and 46 elementary (private) schools, with 167 girls in the public and 91 in the private schools. The Anglo-veracular schools at Hissar town, Bhiwani, and Sirsa are the most important. Two girls' schools at Bhiwani are maintained by the Baptist Zanana Mission. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 40,000, to which Provincial funds contributed Rs. 2,000, municipalities Rs. 11,000, fees Rs. 10,000, and District funds Rs. 16,000, while the rest (Rs. 1,000) was met from subscriptions and endowments.\n\nBesides the dispensary at Hissar the District possesses eight outlying dispensaries. In 1904 at these institutions 71,314 out-patients and 2,216 in-patients were treated, and 6,027 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 20,000, the greater part of which was met from municipal funds.\n\nThe number of successful vaccinations in 1903-4 was 18,038, or 23.7 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n[J.

The population in 1901 was 128,783, compared with 122,299 in 1891. Hissar Town (population, 17,647) is the head-quarters, and the tahsil also contains 134 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to 1.6 lakhs. The northern part is a bare plain, forming part of the tract known as Hariana, where the soil is a firm sandy loam. South of the thin belt of fertility afforded by the Western Jumna Canal, the level stretches of poor cultivation gradually merge into the rolling sandhills characteristic of the neighbouring State of Bikaner.\n\nHissar Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the District and tahsil of the same name, Punjab, situated in 29\u00b0 10' N. and 75\u00b0 44' E., on the Rewari-Bhatinda branch of the Rajputana-Malwa Railway; distant by rail from Calcutta 1,097 miles, from Bombay 979, and from Karachi 819. Population (1901), 17,647. It was founded in 1356 by Firoz Shah Tughlak, and supplied with water by means of the canal now known as the Western Jumna Canal, and became the head-quarters of a sarkar. In 1408 Hissar fell into the hands of the rebels against Mahmud Tughlak, but was recovered in 1411 by the emperor in person. It appears to have been occupied by an imperial garrison at the time of Babar's invasion, and as the head-quarters of a sarkar was of considerable importance under the Mughals. The town was\nplundered by the Sikhs on several occasions between 1754 and 1768, and after the battle of Jind was occupied by Amar Singh of Patiala, who built a fort. Hissar was depopulated by the famine of 1783, and was taken possession of by George Thomas. The inhabitants began to return, and when it passed to the British in 1803 the town was rapidly recovering. In 1857 detachments of the Hariana Light Infantry and 14th Irregular Cavalry stationed at Hissar mutinied, and the Collector and eleven other Europeans and native Christians were murdered. The chief relic of antiquity is the fort built by Firoz Shah, largely with materials taken from Hindu or Jain temples. Another interesting building is the Jahaj, apparently once a Jain temple converted into a mosque, and used as a residence by George Thomas, of whose Christian name its present title is a corruption. Near Hissar is a handsome group of tombs erected to commanders who fell in Humayun's campaign in Gujarat in 1535. The trade of the town is unimportant, being confined to cotton and red pepper; but it contains a large cotton-ginning and pressing factory, which in 1904 employed 397 hands. The municipality was created in 1867. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 28,700 and Rs. 29,300, and in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 24,600 and Rs. 27,300 respectively, the chief source of income being octroi. The town possesses an Anglo-vernacular high school managed by the Educational department, and a civil hospital.\n\nHisua.\u2014Town in the Nawada subdivision of Gay\u0101 District, Bengal, situated in 24\u00b0 50' N. and 85\u00b0 25' E., on the right bank of the river Tilaya on the Gay\u0101 and Nawada road, 9 miles from Nawada and 27 miles from Gay\u0101 town. Population (1901), 6,704. Hisua is a station (Tilaya) on the South Bihar Railway. The town is noted for its pottery.\n\nHiwarkhed.\u2014Town in the Akot taluk of Akola District, Berar, situated in 21\u00b0 8' N. and 76\u00b0 54' E. Population (1901), 6,143. The chief trade of the town is in cotton and other agricultural produce.\n\nHkamti Long.\u2014A collection of seven small Shan principalities, lying approximately between 27\u00b0 and 28\u00b0 N. and 97\u00b0 and 98\u00b0 E., north of Myitkyina District, Upper Burma, and east of the north-east corner of Assam. Their area is about 900 square miles and their population about 11,000; but these are only approximations, for, though nominally under the supervision of the Commissioner of the Mandalay Division, Hkamti Long is beyond the 'administrative' border of the Province, and has not yet been brought under direct control. Portions of it have, however, been ascertained to be fertile and fairly populous. It is watered by the Malikha. The tract was formerly an outlying district of the Shan kingdom of Mogaung, and a considerable portion of its inhabitants are still Shans; but the Shan population has of late been\nhemmed in, owing to the pressure of the Kachins and other hill tribes. It was visited by Colonels Macgregor and Woodthorpe in 1884-5, by Mr. Errol Gray in 1892-3, and by Prince Henry of Orleans in 1893.\n\n**Hlaing.**\u2014River of Lower Burma. *See Rangoon River.*\n\n**Hlaingbwe.**\u2014Easternmost township of Thaton District, Lower Burma, lying between $16^\\circ 43'$ and $17^\\circ 51'$ N. and $97^\\circ 35'$ and $98^\\circ 20'$ E., with an area of 2,035 square miles. It is separated from Siam on the east by the Thaungyin river, and is hilly and sparsely populated, its inhabitants being mostly Karens. The population was 28,411 in 1891, and 43,726 in 1901, distributed in 208 villages, of which the largest is Hlaingbwe (population, 1,208), the head-quarters, on the east bank of the Hlaingbwe river, 108 miles from Moulmein. The area cultivated in 1903-4 was 81 square miles, paying Rs. 49,500 land revenue.\n\n**Hlegu.**\u2014South-western township of Pegu District, Lower Burma, lying between $16^\\circ 54'$ and $17^\\circ 37'$ N. and $96^\\circ 1'$ and $96^\\circ 25'$ E., with an area of 703 square miles. The population was 44,758 in 1891, and 49,642 in 1901. The township contains 233 villages, one of the largest of which is Hlegu (population, 1,666), the head-quarters, situated about 12 miles west of the railway, at the point where the Rangoon-Pegu road crosses the Pazundaung stream. The population is mainly Burman, but Karens are numerous. Except at its northern end, Hlegu is level and fertile. The area cultivated in 1903-4 was 161 square miles, paying Rs. 2,57,600 land revenue. The township was formerly known as Paunghlin, and was included in Hanthawaddy District till 1883.\n\n**Hmawza.**\u2014Western township of the Prome subdivision of Prome District, Lower Burma, lying in flat well-populated country between $18^\\circ 39'$ and $19^\\circ 6'$ N. and $95^\\circ 9'$ and $95^\\circ 36'$ E., with an area of 273 square miles. The population decreased from 78,962 in 1891 to 68,591 in 1901, but still averages more than 250 persons per square mile. It is practically entirely Burman. There are 447 villages, the head-quarters being at Hmawza (population, 580), situated on the railway 5 miles east of Prome town. In 1903-4 the area cultivated was 125 square miles, paying Rs. 1,25,000 land revenue. The township was formerly known as Mahathaman.\n\n**Ho.**\u2014An aboriginal tribe of the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur Division, Bengal, akin to the Mund\u0101s, Bhumijs, and Sant\u0101ls. The word Ho (Mund\u0101ri, Horo) means a \u2018man\u2019 in the tribal vernacular, which differs but slightly from Mund\u0101ri. The Hos, who numbered 386,000 in 1901, are the characteristic tribe of the Kolh\u0101n Government estate in Singhbh\u016bm District, which they conquered from the earlier inhabitants and successfully defended against all comers until subdued by the British in the early part of the nineteenth century. Their prowess earned them the sobriquet of the Lark\u0101 (or \u2018fighting\u2019) Kols. They are great sports-\nmen, and every year in May they meet together and beat the jungles for game of all descriptions. Their national weapon is the bow and arrow. The great majority of the tribe are Animists, and, unlike their allied tribes, very few of them have as yet become converts to Christianity. They are an exceedingly exclusive race, and are well off, as they hold their lands on easy terms. The bride-price is absurdly high, varying from 10 to 30 head of cattle, as compared with 3 head with the Mund\u0101s. As a consequence, the large number of adult unmarried girls is a peculiar feature in the social state of the community.\n\n**Hodal.**\u2014Town in the Palwal tahsil of Gurgaon District, Punjab, situated in 27\u00b0 53' N. and 77\u00b0 23' E., on the grand trunk road between Delhi and Muttra, and on the Delhi-Agra branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 8,142. A cotton-ginning factory gave employment to 61 persons in 1904, but the town has little trade. Saltpetre is refined to a certain extent. The J\u0101t chief, S\u016braj Mal, was connected by marriage with the J\u0101ts of Hodal, and the remains of several fine buildings erected by him still exist. The municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 6,100, and the expenditure Rs. 5,000. In 1903\u20134 the income amounted to Rs. 6,300, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 7,300. There is a Government dispensary.\n\n**Holalkere.**\u2014South-western taluk of Chitaldroog District, Mysore (which included Hosdurga as a sub-taluk up to 1902), lying between 13\u00b0 52' and 14\u00b0 15' N. and 76\u00b0 2' and 76\u00b0 25' E., with an area of 405 square miles. The population in 1901 was 81,204, compared with 67,051 in 1891. After the reconstruction of the taluk in 1903 the population was 44,848. The taluk now contains one town, Holalkere (population, 3,418), the head-quarters; and 180 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 87,000. To the east and north are chains of hills included in the Chikn\u0101yakanhalli auriferous band. There is also a group in the west, covered with low jungle. The rest of the taluk is comparatively flat, with red soil, though black soil is found in the south-west. There is good grazing towards the centre. The drainage is mostly north-west to the S\u016blekere tank.\n\n**Holavanhalli.**\u2014Village in the Maddagiri taluk of Tumk\u016br District, Mysore, situated in 13\u00b0 32' N. and 77\u00b0 18' E., on the west bank of the Jayamangali, 18 miles north-east of Tumk\u016br town. Population (1901), 1,682. It was originally called Korampur; but Baire Gauda, one of the Avati family, built the fort and named it after the chief in possession. The estate became tributary to Vijayanagar, but was before long taken by the chief of Dod-Ball\u0101pur, and two years later by the S\u016bbahd\u0101r of S\u012bra, who restored it to the family. They fortified Koratagere and extended their territory, continuing to rule till subdued by Haidar Ali. The municipality, formed in 1894, was converted into a Union in 1904.\nThe receipts and expenditure during the seven years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 4,500 and Rs. 4,250. In 1903-4 they were Rs. 900 and Rs. 1,100.\n\n**Hole-Narsipur Taluk.**\u2014South-eastern taluk of Hassan District, Mysore, lying between 12\u00b0 36' and 12\u00b0 56' N. and 76\u00b0 9' and 76\u00b0 22' E., with an area of 233 square miles. The population in 1901 was 57,149, compared with 50,894 in 1891. The taluk contains one town, Hole-Narsipur (population, 6,526), the head-quarters; and 238 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 87,000. The Hemavati river runs through the north, and turning south forms part of the eastern boundary. Two channels, 47\u00bd miles and 12 miles long, drawn from the Srirama deva dam, irrigate 5,020 acres. Except for this the taluk is sterile, the soil being generally very poor, with bleak uplands in the south. Near Hole-Narsipur are a few isolated hills.\n\n**Hole-Narsipur Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the taluk of the same name in Hassan District, Mysore, situated in 12\u00b0 47' N. and 76\u00b0 14' E., on the Hemavati river, 21 miles south-east of Hassan. Population (1901), 6,256. The fort was built in 1168 by a chief who also owned Channarayapatna. It was taken by the ruler of Mysore in 1667. It contains the math of the guru of the Uttaradi branch of Madhva Brahmins. Cotton cloth of good quality and gunny-bags are made. The municipality dates from 1873. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 3,000 and Rs. 3,700. In 1903-4 they were Rs. 3,800 and Rs. 4,800.\n\n**Homalin Subdivision.**\u2014Northern subdivision of the Upper Chindwin District, Upper Burma, containing the Paungbyin, Homalin, and Maingkaing townships. The head-quarters are at Homalin.\n\n**Homalin Township.**\u2014North-western township of the Upper Chindwin District, Upper Burma, lying along the Chindwin on either bank, between 24\u00b0 44' and 26\u00b0 0' N. and 94\u00b0 43' and 96\u00b0 0' E., with an area of 2,524 square miles. It is a mass of hills, comparatively low in the east, but rising in the west to a considerable height. The population, which is almost entirely Shan, was 11,000 in 1891, and 17,624 in 1901, distributed in 166 villages. The head-quarters are at Homalin (population, 1,241), on the Chindwin river, 130 miles above Kindat, and the highest point ordinarily visited by the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company's steamers. The area cultivated in 1903-4 was 32 square miles, and the land revenue and thathameda amounted to Rs. 30,000.\n\n**Homnabad.**\u2014Town in the paigah taluk of Chincholi, Hyderab\u0101d State, situated in 17\u00b0 47' N. and 77\u00b0 08' E. Population (1901), 7,136. It has declined considerably in prosperity since the opening of the Niz\u0101m's State Railway, which has diverted trade.\n\n**Honalli.**\u2014Taluk of Shimoga District, Mysore. See Honnalli.\n\n**Honavalli.**\u2014Town in Tumkur District, Mysore. See Honnnavalli.\nHon\u0101var T\u0101luka.\u2014Southern t\u0101luka of North Kanara District, Bombay, lying between 13\u00b0 53' and 14\u00b0 26' N. and 74\u00b0 26' and 74\u00b0 47' E., with an area of 426 square miles. It includes the petty subdivision (petha) of Bhatkal. The t\u0101luka contains two towns, Hon\u0101var (population, 6,929), the head-quarters, and Bhatkal (6,964); and 152 villages, including Manki (6,008) and Haldipur (5,109). The population in 1901 was 100,068, compared with 93,523 in 1891. The density, 235 persons per square mile, largely exceeds the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was 1\u00b79 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 12,000. The t\u0101luka is well watered by unfailing streams. The Gersoppa or Shar\u0101vati river intersects the country, flowing from east to west. The famous Gersoppa Falls are 35 miles east of Hon\u0101var town. Near the spurs of the Western Gh\u0101ts the forest begins, and, as elsewhere in Kanara, grows deeper and richer as the Gh\u0101ts are approached. The climate is good. The rainfall is the heaviest in the District, averaging 140 inches at Hon\u0101var and increasing to 156 inches in Bhatkal.\n\nHon\u0101var Town (or Onore).\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luka of the same name in North Kanara District, Bombay, situated in 14\u00b0 17' N. and 74\u00b0 27' E., 50 miles south-east of K\u0101rw\u0101r, on the north of an extensive inlet of the sea, which at its south-eastern extremity receives the Gersoppa or Shar\u0101vati river. Population (1901), 6,929. In 1903-4 the value of the exports was 6 lakhs, and of the imports 4 lakhs. The town is mentioned by Abul Fida (1273-1331); and shortly afterwards (1342) is described by Ibn Batuta as rich and well governed, with 23 schools for boys and 13 for girls. At the beginning of the sixteenth century it is said to have exported much rice, and to have been frequented by shipping. In 1505 the Portuguese built a fort at Hon\u0101var; and two years later, in consequence of a dispute with the king of Vijayanagar, they attacked and burnt the town. Cesare de' Federici (1563-81) calls 'Onor' a fort of the Portuguese; and in 1623 De la Valle found it a small place, still in the hands of the Portuguese. On the decay of the Portuguese power in India, Hon\u0101var was acquired by the sovereigns of Bednur; and on the conquest of Bednur by Haidar Ali, this town also submitted to him. In 1783 it was taken by assault by a British force dispatched from Bombay, under the command of General Mathews; and in 1784 was successfully defended by Captain Torriano against Tip\u016b Sult\u0101n, to whom, however, in the same year, it was ceded by the Treaty of Mangalore. On the overthrow of Tip\u016b in 1799 it again came into the possession of the British. The town lies about 2 miles from the coast at the mouth of the Gersoppa river, which, with a dangerous bar and an entrance channel about 300 feet broad, expands into a lake 5 miles long and 1 to 2 miles broad. In the lake are five islands, the largest 3 miles long, covered\nwith palm-trees. About 2 miles north of Hon\u0101var is R\u0101mtirth, with a temple of R\u0101mling. Basavrajdurg, also called Fortified Island, about 3 miles from Hon\u0101var, was fortified by Sivappa Naik. Hon\u0101var has been a municipality since 1890, and had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 4,100. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 8,000. The town contains a Subordinate Judge\u2019s court, a dispensary, a middle school, and four other schools.\n\nHongal (Bail Hongal).\u2014Village in the Sampaona taluka of Belgaum District, Bombay, situated in 15\u00b0 49\u2032 N. and 74\u00b0 52\u2032 E. Population (1901), 8,675. There are manufactures of coarse cotton cloth and articles of native apparel, some of which are sold in the neighbouring markets, and the remainder exported via Belgaum to the Konkan. Hongal is built on rising ground at the eastern side of a fine tank from which is drawn the main water-supply of the inhabitants. North of the village stands an old Jain temple, now converted into a lingam shrine, which contains two inscriptions of the twelfth century. The prefix \u2018Bail\u2019 refers to the fact of the place being built in an open black-soil country. The market is celebrated for the superior class of bullocks brought to it for sale. A large annual fair is held, at which wrestlers from the surrounding country assemble. There is a branch of the Methodist Episcopal Mission with a mission house and a chapel, and two schools, one for boys and one for girls, with 60 and 30 pupils respectively. There are also two other boys\u2019 schools with 220 pupils.\n\nHonn\u0101li.\u2014North-eastern taluk of Shimoga District, Mysore, lying between 14\u00b0 4\u2032 and 14\u00b0 22\u2032 N. and 75\u00b0 24\u2032 and 75\u00b0 51\u2032 E., with an area of 331 square miles. The population in 1901 was 68,721, compared with 63,577 in 1891. The taluk contains two towns, Honn\u0101li (population, 3,894), the head-quarters, and Ny\u0101mti (3,461); and 165 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,21,000. The taluk is crossed from south to north by the Tungabhadra with a winding course, and bounded east and west by lines of low stony hills. The north and east consist of \u2018dry-crop\u2019 country of unusual fertility, good black soil being common, and cotton and jola the chief crops. The extreme west is purely a rice country, with some sugar-cane, the staple \u2018dry crop\u2019 being r\u0101gi. Very rich black soil prevails around Ny\u0101mti and Belagutti. The Honn\u0101li gold-mines were started in the southwest, at the foot of the hills of which the Kalva Rangan peak (3,388 feet) is the highest, but they have ceased working for many years, owing partly to the influx of water. At a bend in the Tungabhadra, where the Hirehalla enters from the west, is the Kuruva island (14\u00b0 10\u2032 N. and 75\u00b0 45\u2032 E.), containing a celebrated R\u0101mesvara t\u012brtha and temple.\n\nHonnavalli.\u2014Town in the Tiptur taluk of Tumk\u016br District, Mysore, situated in 13\u00b0 20\u2032 N. and 76\u00b0 23\u2032 E., 5 miles north of\nKonehalli railway station. It is named after the tutelary goddess, Honmu-amma, who in a vision directed Somesvara, a chief of Harnhalli (Hassan District), to found the town. It is situated amid coco-nut plantations, which produce a rare kind called Gang\u0101-p\u0101ni, the young nut of which yields delicious milk. The inhabitants include many Br\u0101hmans. The municipality, formed in 1900, became a Union in 1904. The receipts and expenditure for the first year were Rs. 1,200 and Rs. 330. In 1903\u20134 they were Rs. 1,300 and Rs. 3,400.\n\nHonnu-hole (or Suvarnavati, both meaning \u2018golden stream\u2019).\u2014A tributary of the Cauvery, rising in the mountains of Coimbatore (Madras). It then flows through the Ch\u0101mr\u0101jnagar taluk and the Yeland\u016br j\u0101gir of Mysore District (Mysore), and re-entering Coimbatore falls into the Cauvery opposite Talak\u0101d, after a course of about 50 miles. Its name is an index of the fertility it spreads on both banks. There are ten permanent dams on it, and additional temporary dams are constructed when the water is low. The channels fed by means of these are more than 50 miles in length, irrigating about 5,000 acres. The river also feeds a number of large tanks, such as the R\u0101masamudra near Ch\u0101mr\u0101jnagar.\n\nHooghly District (H\u016bgli).\u2014South-eastern District of the Burdw\u0101n Division, Beng\u0101l, lying between 22\u00b0 36\u2032 and 23\u00b0 14\u2032 N. and 87\u00b0 30\u2032 and 88\u00b0 30\u2032 E. Excluding the separate District of Howrah, which for revenue purposes still forms part of Hooghly, it has an area of 1,191 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the District of Burdw\u0101n; on the east by the Hooghly river; on the south by the District of Howrah; and on the west by the Districts of Midnapore, B\u0101nkur\u0101, and Burdw\u0101n.\n\nThe high bank of the Hooghly river is densely populated and lined by gardens and orchards, interspersed with villages, temples, and factories; but between it and the bank of the D\u0101modar extends a swampy waterlogged tract, which gradually rises towards the north-west. The principal rivers are the Hooghly, D\u0101modar, and R\u016bpn\u0101r\u0101yan. The Hooghly nowhere crosses the boundary, and the R\u016bpn\u0101r\u0101yan (here called the Dw\u0101rkeswar) flows only for a few miles across its western angle. The D\u0101modar, which formerly entered the Hooghly about 39 miles above Calcutta, now flows almost due south across Hooghly and Howrah Districts, joining the Hooghly opposite Falt\u0101. The result is a partial obstruction to the current of the latter river, and a consequent deposit of silt which forms the dangerous James and Mary Sands. As in other deltaic Districts, the silt carried by the rivers is deposited in the river-beds and on their banks, which are thus gradually raised above the level of the surrounding country. Extensive swamps have in this way been formed between the Hooghly and the D\u0101modar and between\nthe latter river and the R\u016bpn\u0101r\u0101yan; the most important are the D\u0101nkuni, S\u0101nti, Khany\u0101n, and Dalki marshes.\n\nThe surface is covered by recent alluvial deposits, consisting of sandy clay and sand along the course of the rivers, and fine silt consolidating into clay in the flatter parts of the river plain.\n\nThe greater part of the District is flat, with the usual aquatic and marsh weeds of the Bengal rice plain, such as Hydrilla, Vallisneria, Aponogeton, Utricularia, and Caesulia. The Gogh\u0101t th\u0101na, though very little higher, is still sufficiently dry to have many of the species characteristic of the western Districts, such as Evolvulus alsinoides, Tragus racemosus, Aristida Adscensionis, Wendlandia exserta, and Gmelina arborea. In the neighbourhood of villages and towns, shrubberies of semi-spontaneous growth and more or less useful species are to be found. The pipal (Ficus religiosa) and the banyan (Ficus indica), with other species of figs, make up, along with bamboos, plantains (Musa sapientum), jack (Artocarpus integrifolia), red cotton-tree (Bombax malabarium), mango (Mangifera), Moringa, and Odina Wodier, the arborescent part of these thickets, in which are often present the date-palm (Phoenix sylvestris) and toddy-palm (Borassus flabellifer). The District contains no forests.\n\nTigers are extremely rare, but leopards are found in the north, and wild hog abound in the Hooghly and Pandua th\u0101nas, where they do much damage to the crops.\n\nThe climate is damp and moist, but the rainfall is seldom excessive, the normal fall being 57 inches, of which 9\u00b77 inches are received in June, 12 in July, 12\u00b75 in August, and 8\u00b71 in September. The D\u0101modar is peculiarly liable to sudden freshes, and floods were formerly common, especially in the south. In September, 1823, the Hooghly river rose to an unprecedented height; and in May, 1833, a very severe storm-wave and floods devastated Mandalgh\u0101t and the southern parganas. In August, 1844, the D\u0101modar burst its banks and turned the whole country between B\u0101li Diw\u0101nganj and Dhani\u0101kh\u0101l into one vast sea of water; and in September, 1845, Mandalgh\u0101t and the south of the District were similarly inundated. Thanks to numerous embankments, floods are now of comparatively rare occurrence; but in the south the country is still liable to inundation, especially on the right side of the D\u0101modar, over which the floods are allowed to spill in order to save the embankments on the left of its course.\n\nIn the pre-Musalm\u0101n period Hooghly formed part of the R\u0101rh and Suhm\u0101 divisions of Bengal, but the historical interest of the District dates from more recent times. The memories of History. many nations cluster round its principal towns, and many a village on the bank of the Hooghly is associated with some historical event. S\u0101tgaon, now a petty village, was the traditional\nmercantile capital of Bengal in the days of Hindu rule, and in the early period of the Muhammadan supremacy was the seat of the governor of Lower Bengal. In the sixteenth century the channel of the Saraswati river, on which S\u0101tgaon is situated, began to silt up, and the principal stream of the Ganges gradually deserted this bed for the Hooghly, at that time a comparatively small river; S\u0101tgaon became inaccessible to large vessels, and in 1537 the Portuguese settled at Hooghly Town. In 1632 this was captured by the Muhammadans, after a three and a half months' siege, and the seat of the royal port of Bengal was removed thither from S\u0101tgaon with all the records and offices. The English factory at Hooghly dates from 1651; and it was here that the English first came into collision with the Muhammadan government in Bengal, with the result that Hooghly was abandoned for Calcutta in 1690. The Dutch established themselves at Chinsura in the early part of the seventeenth century, and held it until it was ceded to Great Britain in 1825. Chandernagore became a French settlement in 1673, and, though more than once occupied by the English, is still a French possession. The Danes made a temporary settlement near the present site of Chandernagore towards the close of the seventeenth century. Their settlement at Serampore, which dates from about 1676, was acquired by the English by purchase in 1845.\n\nIn 1759 Burdwan (which then included the present Hooghly District), Midnapore, and Chittagong were assigned to the East India Company by Mir K\u0101sim for the support of troops to be kept up by the Company; and in 1765 the Mughal emperor invested the Company with the Diw\u0101ni of Bengal. Hooghly was separated from Burdwan as a separate magisterial charge in 1795, and in 1819 it was constituted a separate revenue jurisdiction. Many changes have taken place in the area of Hooghly from time to time, owing to transfers to and from neighbouring Districts, the most important being the erection of Howrah into a separate magisterial charge in 1843.\n\nThe population of the District fell from 1,119,631 in 1872 to 974,992 in 1881, but rose again to 1,034,296 in 1891 and to 1,049,282 in 1901. The surface is but little above sea-level, and the drainage is deteriorating owing to the silting up of old streams and watercourses. The soil is waterlogged, and the District is consequently very unhealthy. About twenty years ago it suffered severely from the malignant Burdwan fever, and, though this has disappeared, fevers of a virulent type are still prevalent. Cholera has been bad in many years, and dysentery also claims its victims. The birth-rate is, outside Calcutta, the lowest in Bengal, and the increase in the population during the last decade is due to immigration.\nThe principal statistics of the Census of 1901 are shown below:\n\n| Subdivision | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of population increase between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Hooghly     | 442                 | 2              | 942      | 308,715    | 698                       | - 0.3                                           | 39,680                                 |\n| Serampore   | 343                 | 5              | 783      | 413,178    | 1,205                     | + 3.3                                           | 49,629                                 |\n| Arambagh    | 406                 |                | 658      | 327,389    | 806                       | + 0.8                                           | 43,321                                 |\n| District total | 1,191               | 8              | 2,383    | 1,049,282  | 881                       | + 1.4                                           | 111,630                                |\n\nThe density of the population is greater than in any other District of Western Bengal, apart from Howrah. Except on the crowded high bank of the Hooghly, it is highest in the south and decreases towards the north and west, where alone it falls below the rate of 800 persons to the square mile. The only part of the District which showed any marked advance in the decade ending 1901 was the Serampore th\u0101na, where the increase exceeded 17 per cent., the actual addition to its population being about the same as that for the District as a whole. Of the towns, Hooghly itself, including Chinsura, the head-quarters of the District, is decadent, but Serampore, the industrial centre, and Bhadreswar are growing rapidly; the other chief towns are Uttarp\u0101ra, Baidya\u0113t\u012b, and B\u0101nsb\u0101ria, all lying along the Hooghly, and Arambagh, the head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name. There is a large immigration from the neighbouring Districts, especially from B\u0101nkur\u0101; and the mills attract numerous labourers from Bih\u0101r, the United Provinces, Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, and Cuttack. Oriy\u0101s are employed as domestic servants and p\u0101lli-bearers, while labourers from Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur and Cuttack work in the brick-fields and elsewhere during the dry season. On the other hand, a large number of natives of the District find employment in Calcutta as petty shopkeepers and clerks. The vernacular spoken is the dialect known as Central Bengali. Hindus number 861,116, or 82 per cent. of the total, and Musalm\u0101ns 184,577, or 17.6 per cent., while of the remainder 2,766 are Animists and 759 Christians. The Muhammadans, who are chiefly Shaikhs, are found mostly in the head-quarters subdivision, where Hooghly and Pandua have long been centres of Muhammadan influence.\n\nThe most numerous Hindu castes are those of the semi-aboriginal B\u0101gdis (189,000), Kaibarttas, the great race-caste of Midnapore (157,000), Br\u0101hmans (73,000), and S\u0101dgops, formerly the dominant caste of Gopbh\u016bm (59,000). Of the total population, 54 per cent. are supported by agriculture\u2014an unusually small proportion for Bengal\u2014\n20 per cent. by industries, 2\u00b75 per cent. by commerce, and 3\u00b78 per cent. by the professions.\n\nA Portuguese mission at B\u0101ndel maintains a school attended by about 75 boys. The United Free Church Rural Mission possesses 2 mission schools and a zan\u0101na mission house, in addition to 4 out-stations. A school, formerly a college, founded in 1812 by the famous missionaries, Marshman, Ward, and Carey, and a training school for native pastors of the Baptist Church are conducted by the Baptist Mission at Serampore.\n\nThe alluvial soil is extremely fertile and produces good rice crops. A strip ten miles broad along the west bank of the D\u0101modar receives the spill waters of that river, and but little rice can be grown on it; but it produces magnificent cold-season crops of mustard and pulses, and also fine sugar-cane. The chief agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are shown below, in square miles:\n\n| Subdivision | Total | Cultivated | Cultivable waste | Irrigated from canals |\n|-------------|-------|------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Hooghly     | 442   | 194        | 75               | 12                   |\n| Serampore   | 343   | 173        | 26               | ...                  |\n| Ar\u0101mb\u0101gh    | 406   | 183        | 63               | ...                  |\n| **Total**   | **1,191** | **550**    | **164**          | **12**               |\n\nRice is the principal crop; large quantities of the finer kinds are grown for the Calcutta market, while coarse rice is imported for local consumption. The winter harvest is the most important crop. Sugar-cane, jute, and betel-leaf (*Piper Betle*) are extensively grown, and the District is noted for its market gardens; potatoes, yams, cauliflowers, cabbages, and brinj\u0101ls (*Solanum melongena*) are grown in great quantities, especially in the Serampore subdivision, for sale in Calcutta.\n\nDuring the last thirty years a series of drainage projects have been carried out to drain the numerous marshes; and the result has been to convert many square miles of marshy country into fertile plough land. Little advantage has been taken of the Land Improvement and Agriculturists\u2019 Loans Acts, the average sums advanced annually during the decade ending 1901\u20132 being only Rs. 2,500.\n\nPasturage is deficient, and the local cattle are poor and ill-fed. They graze on the stubble and, while the crops are on the ground, are stall-fed with rice straw. Sheep are fattened for the Calcutta market, especially in the Pandua th\u0101na.\n\nThe ordinary crops are irrigated only in seasons of drought; but potatoes, sugar-cane, and betel-leaf require plentiful irrigation, the water being lifted from the nearest river, *kh\u0101l*, or tank. Some irrigation takes place from the Eden and Midnapore Canals.\nA valuable description of fine sand used for mortar is dug up from the old bed of the Saraswati river at Magr\u0101, and limestone is quarried in tracts bordering on Midnapore District.\n\nIn the early days of the East India Company, silk and cotton fabrics to the annual value of about 10 lakhs were woven; and though these industries have declined, they are still important, and superior cotton fabrics fetch high prices. Silk and tasar fabrics are manufactured in the Aramb\u0101gh subdivision, and silk handkerchiefs in Serampore town. The chief centres of the cotton-weaving industry are Serampore, Harip\u0101l, and Khany\u0101n, the weavers in Serampore and its neighbourhood using an improved handloom with a fly-shuttle. Silk and cotton cloths are dyed by the weaving classes, and at Serampore silks are dyed and colour-printed. Some chikan work (embroidery) is done in the Dhani\u0101kh\u0101li th\u0101na. Gunny cloth is manufactured at B\u0101lugh\u0101t, and jute and hemp rope at Ch\u0101tra, Sankarpur, Nabagr\u0101m, and Khalsini. Castor and mustard oils are largely manufactured. Brass and bell-metal utensils are made in several places, especially in the neighbourhood of B\u0101nsb\u0101ria and K\u0101m\u0101rp\u0101ra. A colony of carpenters near Chandernagore works for the Calcutta shops, and in the Gogh\u0101t th\u0101na ebony-wood work is manufactured, the articles finding a ready sale in Calcutta and the neighbouring Districts. Baskets are made at M\u0101y\u0101pur, Bandipur, and Magr\u0101, and good mats are woven at Serampore, Bandipur, Akri, and Borai. Common pottery-ware is made at Bhadreswar and Sukind\u0101, and large quantities of bricks, tiles, and surki are manufactured, chiefly in the Serampore subdivision. A cotton-mill at Serampore employs 800 hands, while as many as 23,000 earn a livelihood in the jute-mills at Serampore, Rishr\u0101, Ch\u0101mpd\u0101ni, Telin\u012bp\u0101ra, and Chandernagore. The Victoria Chemical Works at Konnagar produced in 1903\u20134 an out-turn of 900 tons of chemicals.\n\nThe chief exports are fine rice, pulses, silk, indigo, jute and hemp rope, cotton cloth, gunny-bags, bricks, tiles, and vegetables; and the chief imports are common rice, English piece-goods, twist and yarn, salt, lime from Burdw\u0101n and Sylhet, tobacco, coal, kerosene oil, ghi, spices, and timber. The principal marts are Seor\u0101phuli, Magr\u0101, Bhadreswar, and B\u0101li Diw\u0101nganj, at all of which agricultural produce is collected for dispatch, chiefly to Calcutta. The hand-loom cotton fabrics are sold at S\u0101lkhi\u0101 Hat in Howrah District. Most of the important trade centres have the advantage of excellent means of transport by rail, river, canal, and road. Pack-bullocks are largely used in Aramb\u0101gh.\n\nThe east of the District is well provided with railways. The East Indian Railway (broad gauge) runs through it for a distance of about 41 miles, with eighteen stations in the District. The T\u0101rakeswar branch of this railway, 22 miles in length, accommodates the pilgrim\ntraffic to the famous temple of T\u0101rakeswar. The Naih\u0101ti branch, leading to the Jubilee Bridge over the Hooghly, establishes communication with the Eastern Bengal State Railway. The T\u0101rakeswar-Magr\u0101 Railway (2 feet 6 inches gauge) leaves the East Indian Railway at Magr\u0101 and joins the T\u0101rakeswar branch at T\u0101rakeswar; recently this line has been extended to Tribeni. The Howrah-Sheakh\u0101la Steam Tramway (2 feet gauge) lies partly, and an extension of the Howrah-Amt\u0101 Light Railway (2 feet gauge) from Jagatballabhpur to Champ\u0101d\u0101nga almost wholly, within the District. Other lines have been projected, including the Hooghly-K\u0101twa extension and the Burdw\u0101n-Howrah chord-line of the East Indian Railway, and the Bishnupur-Howrah chord-line of the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway.\n\nThe grand trunk road from Calcutta crosses the Hooghly at Palt\u0101 and traverses the District for 37 miles, being joined at Ghireti by a branch from S\u0101lkhi\u0101 through Serampore; it is maintained by the District board, the expenditure being met from Provincial funds. There are in addition 506 miles of District roads, of which 78 are metalled, and 844 miles of village tracks. The old Benares road was formerly a military road, but it is now in a neglected condition, being annually flooded by the water of the D\u0101modar. The road from Tribeni to Guptip\u0101ra formed the old through route from Calcutta to Nabadwip, Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, Rangpur, and Darjeeling. Other roads connect Chinsura with Dhanikh\u0101li and Kh\u0101npur, Hooghly town with Majn\u0101n, Magr\u0101 with Kh\u0101npur, Pandua with K\u0101lna, Bainchi with Dasgh\u0101r\u0101, Chandernagore with Bhol\u0101, Baidyab\u0101\u1e6d\u012b with T\u0101rakeswar, Nabagr\u0101m with Chaspur, Ar\u0101mb\u0101gh with Tetulm\u0101ri, Uchalan with Midnapore, and M\u0101y\u0101pur with Jagatpur, via Kh\u0101n\u0101kul. The roads in the Ar\u0101mb\u0101gh subdivision are mostly fair-weather tracks, barely passable by bullock-carts in the rains.\n\nA daily service of steamers plies on the Hooghly between Calcutta and K\u0101lna in Burdw\u0101n, calling at several places in Hooghly District for passengers and cargo.\n\nThe District is practically immune from famine; but in 1866 some relief measures were necessary, and in 1874 there was slight distress in the northern th\u0101nas.\n\nFor administrative purposes the District is divided into three subdivisions, with head-quarters at Chinsura, Serampore, and Ar\u0101mb\u0101gh. The Magistrate-Collector is also Collector of Howrah, which is subordinate to Hooghly for revenue purposes. He is assisted at head-quarters by a staff of one Joint-Magistrate and six Deputy-Magistrate-Collectors. The Serampore subdivision is in charge of a Joint-Magistrate, assisted by a Deputy-Magistrate-Collector and a Sub-Deputy-Collector. The subdivisional officer of Ar\u0101mb\u0101gh is a Deputy-Magistrate-Collector, and\nhe has a Sub-Deputy-Collector subordinate to him. Chinsura is the head-quarters of the Commissioner of the Burdwan Division and of the District Civil Surgeon; a second Civil Surgeon is stationed at Serampore.\n\nThe District and Sessions Judge is also Judge of Howrah; subordinate to him for civil work are two Sub-Judges, a Small Cause Court Judge, and eight Munsifs, of whom two sit at Hooghly, three at Serampore, and three at Arambagh. The Additional District and Sessions Judge of the Twenty-four Parganas is also Additional District and Sessions Judge of Hooghly. The criminal courts include those of the Sessions and Additional Sessions Judges, the District Magistrate, and the above-mentioned magistrates. With the exception of dacoity, the District is comparatively free from serious crime. The French settlement of Chandernagore used to be a centre for the smuggling of opium and spirits, but this illicit trade has now been checked.\n\nThe current land revenue demand, including that for Howrah, amounted in 1903-4 to 13.64 lakhs, payable by 4,229 estates. The greater portion of the District is permanently settled, and the total demand from other classes of estates is only Rs. 60,000. Owing to the close assessment at the time of the Permanent Settlement, the incidence of land revenue (which amounts to Rs. 3 0-8 per cultivated acre) is higher than in any other District in Bengal, except Burdwan, of which Hooghly at that time formed part. As in that District, patni and darpatni tenures are common. Rents are high and have risen of late years. First-class rice land, which was formerly rented for Rs. 11-4 an acre, now pays from Rs. 15-12 to Rs. 27, and the rent of inferior rice land has risen from between Rs. 5-10 and Rs. 6-12 to between Rs. 7-14 and Rs. 10-2 an acre. Mulberry and tobacco lands are rented at from Rs. 18 to Rs. 45 an acre, and sugar-cane land at from Rs. 18 to Rs. 36.\n\nThe following table shows the collections of land revenue and of total revenue (principal heads only), in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 13,37* | 14,29* | 13,36* | 13,83* |\n| Total revenue  | 21,90  | 25,99  | 25,78  | 24,23  |\n\n* Includes Howrah.\n\nOutside the eight municipalities of Hooghly (with Chinsura), Serampore, Uttarpara, Baidyabati, Bhadreswar, Kotrang, Bansbaria, and Arambagh, local affairs are managed by a District board, with subordinate local boards in each subdivision, besides five Union committees. In 1903-4 the total income of the District board was Rs. 1,48,000, of which Rs. 79,000 was derived from Provincial\nrates; the expenditure amounted to Rs. 1,68,000, of which Rs. 98,000 was spent on public works. The Howrah-Sheakh\u0101la Light Railway was constructed in 1897 under the auspices of the District board, which guarantees 4 per cent. on the capital and receives half the net profits above that sum. Under this agreement the District board paid Rs. 6,243 and Rs. 3,471 in 1896-7 and 1898-9 respectively; since that time the financial position has improved, and though the board has sometimes had to pay smaller sums, it has also occasionally received a share of the profits.\n\nEmbankments have been constructed along portions of the Dw\u0101rke\u015bwar, Sankra, R\u016bpn\u0101r\u0101yan, D\u0101modar, K\u0101na D\u0101modar, K\u0101na N\u0101di, and Saraswati rivers. The D\u0101nkuni marsh was drained in 1873, and 20 square miles of almost valueless and very malarious country were thereby converted into fertile arable land. A small portion of the District is irrigated from the Eden Canal. The Hooghly is spanned at Naih\u0101ti by a large cantilever bridge, which was opened in 1887 (see Hooghly River).\n\nThe District contains 13 police stations and 23 outposts. The force subordinate to the District Superintendent in 1903 consisted of 3 inspectors, 42 sub-inspectors, 67 head constables, and 699 constables. Chinsura is the head-quarters of a company of military police 100 strong, which is utilized, when necessary, to maintain order among the men working in the numerous mills on both banks of the Hooghly. There is one policeman to every 2.1 miles of area and to every 1,883 persons. The rural police consists of 276 daffad\u0101rs and 2,804 chaukid\u0101rs. The District jail at Hooghly town can hold 437 prisoners, and sub-jails at Serampore and Aramb\u0101gh have a total accommodation for 43.\n\nIn 1901 the proportion of literate persons was 10.6 per cent. (19.7 males and 1.4 females). The proportion of literate females is higher than in any other part of Bengal except Calcutta. The total number of pupils under instruction was 53,956 in 1892-3 and 43,911 in 1900-1. In 1903-4, 43,667 boys and 3,549 girls were at school, being respectively 55.2 and 4.5 per cent. of the children of school-going age. The number of educational institutions, public and private, in the latter year was 1,469, including two Arts colleges, 97 secondary, 1,224 primary, and 145 special schools. The expenditure on education was 3.45 lakhs, of which Rs. 60,000 was met from Provincial funds, Rs. 42,000 from District funds, Rs. 5,000 from municipal funds, and 1.81 lakhs from fees. The principal educational institutions are in Hooghly town, but one of the Arts colleges is at Uttarp\u0101ra, where there is also a large public library given by Babu Jay Krishna Mukharji, the founder of the college. Public libraries are likewise maintained at Hooghly town and Serampore.\nIn 1903 the District contained 13 dispensaries, of which 6 had a total accommodation for 131 in-patients; the cases of 71,000 out-patients and 2,111 in-patients were treated, and 5,308 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 32,000, of which Rs. 4,000 was met from Government contributions, Rs. 16,000 from Local and Rs. 7,000 from municipal funds, and Rs. 4,000 from subscriptions. Besides these, there were in 1903 one police hospital and one railway hospital at Hooghly town, and sixteen private hospitals in the District.\n\nVaccination, which is compulsory within the municipal areas, is not making great progress in the District. In 1903-4 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 25,000, representing 27 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n[Sir W. W. Hunter, *Statistical Account of Bengal*, vol. iii (1876); G.

The subdivision is a flat alluvial tract, intersected by numerous streams and containing a number of swampy depressions. The population in 1901 was 308,715, compared with 309,616 in 1891, the density being 698 persons per square mile. It contains two towns, Hooghly with Chinsura (population, 29,383), its head-quarters, and Bansbaria (6,473); and 942 villages. In addition to Hooghly and Chinsura, S\u0101tgaon, B\u0101ndel, and Pandua possess historical and Tribeni some religious interest. Magra is an important mart.\n\n**Hooghly River.**\u2014The most westerly, and for commercial purposes the most important, channel by which the waters of the Ganges enter the Bay of Bengal, being formed by the confluence of the three western distributaries of the great stream\u2014the Bh\u0101girathi, Jalangi, and Mat\u0101bh\u0101nga\u2014which are conjointly known as the Nadi\u0101 Rivers. The Bh\u0101girathi receives also an independent supply of water from the eastern watershed of the Chot\u0101 Nagpur plateau, where its tributaries drain an area of about 8,700 square miles. The Bh\u0101girathi joins the Jalangi at Nadi\u0101 town, in 23\u00b0 25' N. and 88\u00b0 24' E., and the distinctive name of the Hooghly is by some assigned to the united rivers from this point; according to others the river does not take this name till just above S\u0101ntipur, 24 miles farther down the stream. The united stream is joined by the Mat\u0101bh\u0101nga 15 miles below Santipur, and it thence proceeds almost due south to Calcutta; it next twists to the south-west, and finally turns south, entering the Bay of Bengal in 22\u00b0 13' N. and 88\u00b0 4' E. After receiving the B\u0101gher Kh\u0101l on the left\nbank, it marks the boundary between the Twenty-four Parganas on the east and the Districts of Hooghly, Howrah, and Midnapore successively on the west, thus separating the Presidency and Burdwan Divisions.\n\nThe head-waters of the Hooghly are important as great highways for inland traffic. Like other deltaic distributaries, they are subject to sudden changes in their channels and to constant silting up; each of them is frequently closed during the dry season, while in most years the depth then maintained does not exceed 2 feet at the shallower places. During these dry months the waters of the Hooghly are largely supplied by underground infiltration of water into the deep trough which the river has scooped out for itself; and the depth of the channel is maintained by the scouring of the current during the rainy season, when the spill streams from the Ganges and the Chota Nagpur tributaries of the Bhagirathi pour down enormous masses of water. The fresh-water supply of the upper reaches of the river is therefore derived partly from the Ganges, partly from the Chota Nagpur plateau, and partly by infiltration; and it is estimated that these three sources provide, respectively, 48, 31, and 21 per cent. of the total supply. The strong freshes in the Hooghly have a most beneficial effect in scouring the channels, and it is noteworthy that the ratio of maximum to minimum fresh-water discharge is as high as 13 to 1. The Hooghly receives four tributaries on the right bank. The D\u0101modar flows into it opposite Falt\u0101, 35 miles below Calcutta, and 6 miles farther down it is joined by the R\u016bpn\u0101r\u0101yan; the Haldi and Rasulpur flow into the estuary of the river. All these tributaries drain the eastern flank of the Chota Nagpur plateau.\n\nThe influence of the tides is felt strongly as high up as Nadi\u0101, especially during the dry season; and it is estimated that the tidal inflow during the four months of the hot season is more than double the total fresh-water discharge of the year. The tides operate usefully in dispersing the alluvium brought down from above, as well as in providing water for navigation over the shoals at high tide. The difference between the lowest depth of water in the dry season and the highest in the rains is no less than 20 feet 10 inches. The greatest mean rise of tide, about 16 feet, takes place in March, April, and May, with a declining range during the rainy season to a mean of 10 feet, and a minimum during freshes of 3 feet 6 inches.\n\nThe tide runs rapidly in the Hooghly, and produces a remarkable example of the fluvial phenomenon known as a 'bore.' This consists of the headwave of the advancing tide, hemmed in where the estuary narrows suddenly and often exceeding 7 feet in height. It is felt as high up as Calcutta, and frequently sinks small boats or dashes them to pieces on the bank.\n\nWithin historic times great changes have taken place in the course\nof the Hooghly. There is good reason to believe that the Bh\u0101g\u012brathi represents the old course of the main stream of the Ganges. It is still called the Ganges by the people along its banks and is held sacred. At Tribeni, on the right bank of the Hooghly, 36 miles above Calcutta, is the closed mouth of the old Sarasvat\u012b river, which formerly carried the main stream of the Ganges by a channel west of the modern Hooghly, which joined the present river at S\u0101nkrail, 6 miles below Howrah. The course of this dead stream can still be traced by pools and marshes, and it was an important river as late as the fifteenth century. S\u0101tgaon, the Muhammadan royal port of Bengal, lay upon its bank a short distance inland from Tribeni, and was the traditional mercantile capital of Bengal from the Pur\u0101nic age to the beginning of the sixteenth century, when the mouth of the Sarasvat\u012b had so far silted up that the Portuguese ships could no longer make use of it.\n\nAnother important change has taken place below Calcutta. At one time the Hooghly, instead of turning south-west at Calcutta, swung to the south-east near the exit of the present Tolly's Nullah, and found its way into the Bay of Bengal near S\u0101gar Island. The old course can be traced in a series of pools and dips across the Twenty-four Parganas, which are still known as the Adi (or 'original') Ganges. The prehistoric shrine of K\u0101l\u012b Gh\u0101\u1e6d and other sacred places of Hinduism mark its course, and its banks still supply holy spots for the burning of the dead. In fact, it is not until the course of the Adi Gang\u0101 rejoins the present Hooghly that this river is again recognized as Mother Ganges and resumes its sanctity; and Hindus who die below the point where the Adi Gang\u0101 left the Hooghly have for many generations been carried to the Hooghly above that point, or to the old banks of the Adi Gang\u0101 itself, for cremation.\n\nThe river may be divided into two sections: the first of 64 miles from S\u0101ntipur to Calcutta, and the second of 80 miles from Calcutta to S\u0101gar Island, where it becomes an estuary.\n\nA serious deterioration in the upper reaches of the Hooghly occurred during the eighteenth century, owing to an alteration in the course of the D\u0101modar. This river originally joined the Hooghly at Nay\u0101 Sarai, 39 miles above Calcutta, and it brought down a great volume of water to assist in scouring the channel. Gradually, however, its floods worked a larger passage for themselves to the southward, and by 1770 it had forced an exit at its present mouth, 35 miles south of Calcutta. The result was that, during the eighteenth century, the Hooghly above Calcutta deteriorated, and shoals formed which rendered the ancient trading settlements no longer accessible to sea-going ships.\n\nThe section of the Hooghly above Calcutta has been famous for 600 years for its entrep\u00f4ts for sea-going trade. Hooghly Town was founded by the Portuguese in 1537, after the Sarasvat\u012b river silted up\nand prevented access to S\u0101tgaon. The Portuguese were followed by the Dutch, who established their factory and port at Chinsura, a mile lower down, in the seventeenth century. Still later in the middle of the eighteenth century, Chandernagore, 2 miles below Chinsura, which had been founded in 1673 as a small French settlement, rose to mercantile importance under Dupleix. The Ostend Company about 1723 fixed their Bengal port at B\u0101nkib\u0101z\u0101r, 5 miles below Chandernagore, but on the left bank of the river. The Danes in about 1676 had selected as their port Serampore, 8 miles below Chandernagore, on the right bank of the river. All these ports and settlements lie at a distance of from 16 to 36 miles above Calcutta, and are now without exception inaccessible to sea-going ships, even of small tonnage.\n\nThe process of silting up was accelerated by the change in the D\u0101modar channel above referred to. In 1757 Admiral Watson took his fleet, with his flagship of 64 guns, as high as Chandernagore for the bombardment of that town, and as late as 1821 the English pilots steered Danish ships of 700 to 800 tons up to Serampore. After 1825, however, this section of the river seems to have rapidly deteriorated, and the Dutch and Danish ships could go no higher than Cossipore, just above Calcutta, and were there unladen into cargo boats. Alluvial formations are still going on in the river-bed from Scrampole upwards. These formations are in many stages of growth, from the well-raised island with trees, down through successive phases of crop cultivation and reedy marshes, to shoals and little dots of dry land which only emerge above the water at certain seasons of the year. Below Calcutta changes in the channel are frequent and the rapid tides make navigation difficult. Lower down the estuary is notorious for its dangerous sand-banks, of which the best known are the Gasper and the S\u0101gar sands. These, however, as also the entrance channels, are continually changing, and a minute description of them would serve no useful purpose.\n\nFrom time to time fears have been entertained with regard to the Hooghly approach to Calcutta; and in 1862 it was proposed to found a new port at Port Canning, 28 miles to the south-east, on the M\u0101tla river, to anticipate the silting up of the Hooghly channels. Trade, however, has clung to the Hooghly. Port Canning proved a failure and has long been deserted; and a later proposal to build docks at Diamond Harbour as an auxiliary port for Calcutta was negatived, and there is no reason to believe that the navigable channels are at present deteriorating. The chief perils to navigation are the James and Mary Sands and the M\u0101y\u0101pur bar. The dangerous shoal known as the James and Mary lies between the entrance of the D\u0101modar and the R\u016bpn\u0101r\u0101yan, and was early recognized as a danger to navigation. On September 24, 1694, the Royal James and Mary was lost on this shoal, to which she gave her name. Banks and shifting quicksands\nare rapidly formed and the channels have to be continually watched and sounded, for if a vessel touches the sand, she is pushed over by the current; and cases are known in which only the yards of a great three-masted ship have remained above water within half an hour after the accident.\n\nDirect efforts to control the channels across these shoals have not yielded favourable results. In 1868 experiments were conducted on the M\u0101y\u0101pur bar, and spurs were run out some distance below high water-line from both banks of the river; but they were found inadequate to guide the flood and ebb tide into one channel, and no improvement resulted. In 1896 an engineering expert, brought out to consider the feasibility of improving the river, suggested that training walls should be built to regulate the channels across the James and Mary and M\u0101y\u0101pur bars; but his recommendations were not considered practicable. A great deal has, however, been done of late years by the Port Commissioners to reduce the dangers of navigation. A scientific survey staff is employed, and the charts which they issue form a lasting and valuable record of the changes that take place. The M\u0101y\u0101pur and the James and Mary bars are sounded daily, the result being telegraphed to both Calcutta and Diamond Harbour for the information of inward or outward-bound pilots; and the height of the water on the bars is signalled from the bank, from the time vessels enter the river until they pass the last dangerous bar at M\u0101y\u0101pur. Much of the credit of maintaining and improving the Hooghly as a great waterway is due to the Calcutta pilots, one of the most highly skilled and best-paid pilot services in the world. Every incoming vessel is boarded from a pilot brig off the Sandheads at the mouth of the Hooghly, and remains in charge of the pilot till he makes over the ship to the harbour-master at Garden Reach on the southern limit of the Port of Calcutta. The result is that whereas, in the eighteenth century, ships of even 700 tons usually discharged their cargoes at Diamond Harbour, vessels drawing 28 feet are now piloted in safety up to Calcutta at favourable states of the tide. Great improvements have also been effected in the Port (see Calcutta). The Port Commissioners maintain a series of shelters or refuges along the east face of the Hooghly estuary and the adjoining Sundarbans, which are supplied with provisions and a few necessary tools for the use of ship-wrecked mariners and are regularly inspected. The entrance of the river is protected against attack by forts at Calcutta, Falt\u0101, and Chingri Kh\u0101l, which mount heavy guns.\n\nThe Hooghly is spanned at Naih\u0101ti by a fine cantilever bridge, consisting of two spans of 420 feet projecting from the banks, and a central span of 360 feet resting on piers of great strength in the middle of the river. The bridge links up the East Indian Railway system with the\nEastern Bengal State Railway and with the docks at Calcutta. Lower down Howrah is connected with Calcutta by a pontoon bridge, which was opened for traffic in 1874.\n\nThe railways have robbed the upper reaches of the Hooghly of much of their boat traffic, but quantities of straw and jute find their way by them to Calcutta. The river is, moreover, connected on its left or eastern bank by various tidal channels and creeks, known as the Calcutta and Eastern Canals, with the eastern Districts, and thus forms the great waterway for boat and steamer traffic from Calcutta, through the Twenty-four Parganas and the Sundarbans, to Eastern Bengal and Assam. On the left bank lie Calcutta with its suburbs of Garden Reach and Cossipore-Chitpur, and Barrackpore, Naihati, Santipur, and Nadi farther up the river. On the right bank Howrah is the most important town, followed by Hooghly, Chinsura, Serampore, and the French settlement of Chandernagore.\n\nThe scenery on the banks of the Hooghly varies greatly. The sea approach is disappointing, and for many miles nothing can be seen but sandbanks, succeeded by mean-looking mud formations covered with coarse grass and raised only a few inches above high tide. As the river narrows above the James and Mary Sands, however, the country is not so low, and grows richer. Trees and rice-fields and villages become common, and at length a section is reached where the banks are high, and lined with hamlets buried under evergreen groves. The palm foliage and feathery bamboos now begin to assert themselves more and more strongly, and give a luxuriant tropical type to the landscape. When at length the Port of Calcutta is reached, a scene of unexpected magnificence, unrivalled in its kind, bursts upon the eye. The dense foliage of the Botanical Gardens, the long tiers of shipping, with the old houses of Garden Reach on the margin in the foreground, the Fort rising from the finely timbered plain on the bank higher up, and the domes, steeples, and noble public buildings of Calcutta beyond gradually unfold their beauties in a long panorama. The traveller really feels that he is approaching a City of Palaces.\n\nHooghly Town.\u2014Head-quarters of Hooghly District, Bengal, situated in $22^\\circ 55' \\text{N.}$ and $88^\\circ 24' \\text{E.}$, on the right bank of the Hooghly river and on the East Indian Railway. Hooghly was founded by the Portuguese in 1537 on the decay of the royal port of S\u0101tgaon. At Gholgh\u0101t, close to the present Hooghly jail, the ruins are still visible of a fortress which formed the nucleus of the town and port of Hooghly. Exasperated by the havoc wrought by the Portuguese pirates at Chittagong, and in order to revenge himself for the Hooghly governor's refusal to assist him when he was in revolt against his father eight years previously, the emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n sent a Mughal force against the\ntown in 1632, which carried it by storm after a three and a half months' siege. Over 1,000 Portuguese were slaughtered, and more than 4,000 men, women, and children were made prisoners, and the place was then established as the royal port in lieu of S\u0101tgaon. The Portuguese were allowed to return to Hooghly in 1633, the emperor making them a grant of 777 bighas of land at B\u0101ndel. The English factory at Hooghly dates from 1651, having been established under a farman granted by the emperor to Dr. Boughton, a surgeon in the East India Company's service, who had cured his favourite daughter of a dangerous illness. In 1686 a dispute took place between the English factors at Hooghly and the Naw\u0101b of Bengal, and a military force was dispatched from England to strengthen and protect the Company's factories there. An accident precipitated the rupture. In October, 1686, three English soldiers were set upon and beaten in the Hooghly bazar and taken to the governor's house. After some street fighting the battery and the governor's house were captured by the English, who subsequently withdrew under an armistice to Calcutta, or S\u016bt\u0101nuti as it was then called. This was the first collision between the English and the Muhammadan government in Bengal.\n\nHooghly was the head-quarters of the Burdwan Division from 1871 to 1875, and from 1879 to 1884 they were at its suburb, Chinsura; they were then moved to Burdwan, but were transferred to Chinsura in 1896. The place is now decadent and its population with that of Chinsura, with which it is incorporated as a municipality, has declined from 34,761 in 1872 to 29,383 in 1901. Hindus constitute 82.8 per cent. and Musalm\u0101ns 16.6 per cent. of the total. The municipality was created in 1865. The income during the decade ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 50,000, and the expenditure Rs. 47,000. In 1903-4 the total income was Rs. 60,000, including Rs. 28,000 derived from a tax on houses and lands, Rs. 18,000 from a conservancy rate, Rs. 5,000 from a tax on vehicles, and Rs. 3,000 from tolls. The incidence of taxation was Rs. 1-13-10 per head of the population. In the same year the expenditure was Rs. 53,000, of which Rs. 4,000 was spent on lighting, Rs. 3,000 on drainage, Rs. 28,000 on conservancy, Rs. 5,000 on roads, and Rs. 900 on education. The municipality maintains 51 miles of metalled and 76 miles of unmetalled roads. The grand trunk road, which passes through the town, and a few short lengths of road in the old cantonment are kept up by Government. The Im\u0101mb\u0101ra is a Shiah mosque, which was completed in 1861 at a cost of 2.2 lakhs from funds bequeathed by a wealthy Shiah nobleman, Muhammad Mohsin. The other principal buildings are the municipal office and jail; the latter has accommodation for 437 prisoners, who are chiefly employed on bag-sewing for the neighbouring jute-mills and oil-pressing. The chief educational institutions are the Hooghly College at Chinsura,\npossessing a branch in Hooghly itself, a training college for schoolmasters, and the Madrasa.\n\n**Hopong** (Burmese, *Hopon*).\u2014A small State in the central division of the Southern Shan States, Burma, lying between $20^\\circ 38'$ and $20^\\circ 59'$ N. and $97^\\circ 6'$ and $97^\\circ 23'$ E., with an area (including its small northern dependency of Hailong) of 232 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Lawksawk and Laihsak; on the east by Mongpawn; on the south by Namhkok; and on the west by Yawngawe, from which it is separated by the Tamhpak stream. Towards the north and east the country is extremely hilly, but a considerable area of irrigated rice land lies in the valleys. *Taungya* rice is worked by the Taunghus, and vegetables, tobacco, and *thanatpet* are cultivated. The population in 1901 was 11,140, distributed in 177 villages. The people are nearly all Buddhists, and according to language were divided into 7,123 Taunghus, 3,775 Shans (inhabiting the plains), and 242 speakers of other languages. The head-quarters of the Myoza are at Hopong (population, 765), on the banks of a small stream called the Namkyeng, and connected by road with Taunggyi. The revenue in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 14,000 (mainly *thathameda*); the chief items of expenditure were Rs. 6,000 tribute to the British Government, Rs. 3,600 spent on pay of officials and general administration, Rs. 2,600 on public works, and Rs. 1,800 paid into the privy purse.\n\n**Horsleykonda** ('Horsley's hill,' so named from Mr. W. D. Horsley, a former Collector, who was the first to build on it, about 1870).\u2014A small hill in the Madanapalle *t\u0101luk* of Cuddapah District, Madras, situated in $13^\\circ 39'$ N. and $78^\\circ 25'$ E., about 9 miles from Madanapalle. The original name of the hill was Yenuga-Mallammakonda, and local tradition says that it was so called because in olden days a saintly lady named Mallamma lived on the top of it and was regularly fed by elephants (*venugulu*). The hill differs from the rest of those in the upland *t\u0101luk*s of Cuddapah in that its summit, about 4,100 feet above the sea, is covered with vegetation and is not quite bare, as usual. Here there is a pretty valley full of trees, on one side of which are three bungalows belonging to the Forest department and the missionaries of the District. The climate is delightful, being free from fever and eighteen degrees cooler than the low country round Cuddapah town. The hill was for a long time supposed to be haunted by demons; and when building on it was first begun, it was with the greatest difficulty that workmen could be persuaded to go up. *Sambhar*, hog, bears, and jungle-fowl are found in its ravines, and an occasional tiger visits it.\n\n**Hosangadi**.\u2014Village in the Coondapoor *t\u0101luk* of South Kanara District, Madras, situated in $13^\\circ 40'$ N. and $74^\\circ 58'$ E., at the foot of\na pass leading into Mysore. General Mathews won a brilliant victory here in January, 1783, on his march from Coondapoor to Bednur, his small force storming a formidable series of defences held by 17,000 men. Remains of the defences, once known as Haidargarh, can still be seen.\n\n**Hosdurga.**\u2014South-western taluk since 1902 (previously a sub-taluk of Holalkere) of Chitaldroog District, Mysore, lying between 13\u00b0 35' and 14\u00b0 5' N. and 76\u00b0 6' and 76\u00b0 34' E., with an area of 567 square miles. The population in 1903 was 45,032. The taluk contains one town, Hosdurga (population, 2,363), the head-quarters; and 252 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 72,000. The Vedavati flows through the middle of the taluk, with a north-easterly course, forming on the eastern border the great Mar Kanave reservoir. The Chiknayakanhalli auriferous band of hills runs through the east. Hosdurga (3,226 feet), in the centre of the taluk, is the principal hill.\n\n**Hoshangabad District.**\u2014District in the Nerbudda Division of the Central Provinces, lying between 21\u00b0 53' and 22\u00b0 59' N. and 76\u00b0 47' and 78\u00b0 44' E., with an area of 3,676 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the Native States of Bhopal and Indore; on the east by Narsinghpur; on the west by Nimar; while the southern border marches with Chhindwara, Betul, and Berar. The District consists of a long narrow strip forming the lower portion of the Narbad\u0101 valley, with sections of the Satpura hill country on the southern border. The Narbad\u0101 is the northern boundary of the District and of the Central Provinces along its whole length in Hoshangabad, running from a little north of east to south of west; and the District extends along its southern bank for a length of over 120 miles, while its width varies from 22 to 40 miles.\n\nNorth of the Narbad\u0101 lie the Vindhyan mountains, in places seen only as a far-off outline, with the plains of Bhopal or Indore spread out below, in other places running in and following the line of the river, the water of which washes their base for miles. In these spots outlying spurs and hills are generally found on the southern side. One such spur, known as the Black Rocks, crops up close to Hoshangabad and supplies the town with building and paving stone. With the exception of these outliers, the portion of the District adjoining the Narbad\u0101 consists of an open black-soil plain of great fertility. In the south the Satpuras generally run in successive ranges parallel to the line of the valley and trending to the south-west. The portions included in the District consist of the block of the Pachmarhi or Mahadeo hills in the south-east, a low outer range of the Satpuras running through the Hoshangabad and Harda tahsils with the valley of the Denwa behind it in the centre, and another wild tract of hill and forest on the south-west called Kalibhit\u00b9, which extends to the Tapti on the border.\n\n\u00b9 Transferred to Nimar District in 1904.\nof Berar. Most of the peaks of the S\u0101tpur\u0101s rise to about 2,000 feet, or a little over, but in the Mah\u0101deo hills there are three with an elevation of over 4,000 feet. Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d town is 1,011 feet above the sea, and the fall of the Narbad\u0101 in this part of its course is rather less than 3 feet in a mile. From the S\u0101tpur\u0101s numerous streams run down through the valley to the Narbad\u0101, having in the east, where the slope of the valley is rapid and direct, a very straight course and a length of only about 24 miles from the base of the hills to their confluence, while in the west they make a circular sweep and usually flow for about 40 miles through the plain. The principal of these streams are the Dudh\u012b on the east, dividing Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d from Narsinghpur, the Taw\u0101 flowing through the Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d taluk, the Ganjal separating Seoni-M\u0101lwa and Hard\u0101, and the Machak on the west. These bring down with them large quantities of sand in their floods, which are very high and rapid, and deposit it on the banks, causing deterioration in the soil to a considerable distance. Where two or three rivers escaping separately from the hills draw close together, the whole of the land enclosed between them is generally poor soil overrun with jungle. Notable instances of this are to be seen in the system of rivers which unite near Soh\u0101gpur, and those which join the Indr\u0101 east of Seoni, in both of which cases a large belt of forest reaches nearly down to the Narbad\u0101.\n\nThe plain portion of the District is covered by alluvial soil, consisting of a stiff reddish, yellowish, or brownish clay, with numerous intercalated bands of sand and gravel. Kankar abounds throughout the deposit, and pisolitic iron granules are of frequent occurrence. The thickness of the alluvial deposits, as exposed along the banks of rivers, usually does not exceed a maximum of 100 feet. In the west, rocks belonging to the transition system, consisting of quartzite, hornstone-breccia, and limestone, occur near Handi\u0101. The hilly tract to the south, embracing the Pachmar\u012b or Mah\u0101deo hills, forms part of the great Gondw\u0101na system. At the base of it occurs the T\u0101lcher group, consisting mainly of greenish silt beds, breaking up into small splintering fragments and hence called needle shales, and green, brown, or whitish felspathic sandstones, in both of which pebbles and large boulders are often irregularly scattered. The T\u0101lchers are overlaid by the D\u0101muda series, which is made up chiefly of thick-bedded, often coarse felspathic sandstones, with subordinate beds of carbonaceous shale and coal.\n\nThe Government forests cover the hills on the southern border and also extend into the plain, especially along the banks of the rivers in the eastern tract. Almost pure teak forest is found on the alluvial flats along the rivers, and on red stony soil on the lower hill-sides. Mixed forest of s\u0101j (Terminalia tomentosa), teak, dhaur\u0101 (Anogeissus latifolia), haldu (Adina cordifolia), tins\u0101 (Ougeinia dalbergioides), and bijas\u0101l\n(Pterocarpus Marsupium) occurs on the middle and lower slopes of the hill belt. On the dry stony hill-tops and plateaux, more especially those of sandstone formation, salai (Roswellia serrata) is predominant, with stunted trees of other species, mainly kha\u00efr (Acacia Catechu) and lendi\u0101 (Lagerstroemia parviflora). Sal (Shorea robusta) is found on the Pachmar\u012b plateau, and anjan (Hardwickia binata) appears in the Denw\u0101 forests of the Soh\u0101gpur range, but does not attain any size.\n\nThe forests are fairly well stocked with game, including bison in the Bor\u012b and R\u0101j\u0101bor\u0101ri tracts, and tigers, leopards, and the usual kinds of deer over most of the wooded area. Antelope are plentiful in the open country. Of birds, peafowl are the most numerous, and the other land game-birds are also common, but duck and snipe are found only in scattered localities. Mahseer may be had in the rivers.\n\nRainfall is registered at the four tahsil head-quarters and at Pachmarhi. The annual fall at Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d town is 50 inches, and this may probably be taken as representing the average for the plain. In the hills the rainfall is much heavier. Until within recent years the District has very rarely suffered from marked deficiency of rain. Thunderstorms occur with comparative frequency in the hot season. Hail is not uncommon and is much dreaded, but dust-storms are unknown. The climate is on the whole healthy. The cold season is characterized by bright cloudless days and cold nights with piercing winds; frost is known, but water never freezes. The summer months are hot and dry, and during the rains the weather is somewhat steamy and oppressive, especially in the town of Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d.\n\nLittle is known of the history of the District before the Mar\u0101th\u0101 invasion. The town of Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d is believed to take its name from Sult\u0101n Hoshang Sh\u0101h Ghor\u012b, the second of the M\u0101lw\u0101 kings, who reigned from 1405 to 1434. History. Hoshang Sh\u0101h may have passed through Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d on his way to Kherl\u0101 in Bet\u016bl, the head-quarters of a Gond dynasty, which he is said by Firishta to have reduced in 1433. In Akbar\u2019s time Handi\u0101 was the head-quarters of a sarkar, and was occupied by a Faujdar and Diw\u0101n and by Mughal troops. Seoni was attached to Bhop\u0101l, and Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d is not mentioned at all. Several reasons point to the conclusion that the eastern part of the District was never conquered by the Muhammadans, but was thought too wild and valueless to wrest from the Gonds who occupied it. On the decay of the Mughal empire the District again reverted to the Gonds, who were probably its original masters. In the early part of the eighteenth century the eastern portion of the Rajw\u0101ra pargana was ruled by four Gond R\u0101j\u0101s of Sobh\u0101pur and Fatehpur, who were feudatories of the Mandl\u0101 kingdom. The centre formed part of the territories of the Deogarh dynasty, and in\nthe west were the petty chiefs of Makrai and Makl\u0101. About 1720 Dost Muhammad, the founder of the Bhop\u0101l family, took Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d town and annexed a considerable territory with it. In 1742 the Peshw\u0101 R\u0101l\u0101j\u012b B\u0101ji Rao passed up the valley on his way to attack Mandl\u0101 and subdued the Handi\u0101 pargana. Eight years later Raghuji Bhonsla of N\u0101gpur overran the whole range of hills from G\u0101wilgarh to Mah\u0101deo, and reduced the country east of Handi\u0101 and south of the Narbad\u0101 except the portion held by Bhop\u0101l. Hostilities between the Bhop\u0101l and N\u0101gpur rulers commenced in 1795 and lasted with little intermission for twenty years. Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d was in that year taken by the N\u0101gpur troops, but was retaken in 1802 by Wazir Muhammad, the celebrated minister of Bhop\u0101l. The Bhop\u0101l dominions north of the Narbad\u0101 were finally lost to the Mar\u0101th\u0101s in 1808. During these wars the Pind\u0101ris, first summoned by Wazir Muhammad to his assistance, but afterwards deserting to his enemies, plundered the country impartially in all directions. It is estimated that not a single village escaped being burnt once or twice during the fifteen years for which their depredations lasted, and the greater part of the District was entirely depopulated. The Pind\u0101ris were extirpated in 1817; and in 1818 the portions of the District belonging to the N\u0101gpur kingdom were ceded, under an agreement subsequently confirmed by the treaty of 1826. In 1844 the Hard\u0101-Handi\u0101 tract was made over by Sindhia in part payment for the Gwalior Contingent, and in 1860 it was permanently transferred and became British territory. The Mutiny of 1857 disturbed the District very little. There was some trouble with the police at Hard\u0101, a petty chief rebelled in the Mah\u0101deo hills, and T\u0101nti\u0101 Top\u012b crossed the valley in 1858; but the authority of the British officers was at no time seriously shaken. The small Feudatory State of Makrai lies in the centre of the Hard\u0101 tahsil.\n\nThe archaeological remains are unimportant. The island of Jog\u0101, picturesquely situated in the Narbad\u0101 near Handi\u0101, has a fort and is supposed to be the site of an old cantonment, remains of masonry wells and buildings being found. At Khat\u0101ma, ten miles from the It\u0101rsi railway station, there is a cave dedicated to Mah\u0101deo, consisting of a plain rectangular room with an enclosed shrine, the front of the cave being supported by four pillars. B\u0101gra contains an old fort ascribed to Hoshang Sh\u0101h Ghori.\n\nThe population of the District at the last three enumerations was as follows: (1881) 467,191; (1891) 497,487; and (1901) 449,165. Up to 1891 development was rapid in the eastern portion of the District, where large tracts of land had long been out of cultivation, but slower in the western tahsils, which were already fully populated. In 1896 a strip of territory on the east of the Hard\u0101 tahsil, 572 square miles in area and containing 32,458 persons,\nwas transferred to Nim\u0101r, and the figures of previous enumerations have been adjusted to allow for this\\(^1\\). The decrease of population in the present area of Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d, during the last decade, was at the rate of nearly 10 per cent., and the District suffered from partial or total failures of crops in six years of the decade. The District contains six towns\u2014H\u0101rd\u0101, Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d, Seoni-M\u0101lw\u0101, Soh\u0101gpur, It\u0101rsi, and Pachmarh\u012b\u2014and 1,334 inhabited villages. The chief statistics of population according to the Census of 1901 are shown below:\n\n| Tahsil       | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|--------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d  | 804                  | 2               | 399      | 125,071    | 156                       | 9.2                                                          | 5,746                                  |\n| H\u0101rd\u0101        | 1,139                | 1               | 400      | 128,858    | 113                       | 10.5                                                         | 6,694                                  |\n| Soh\u0101gpur     | 1,243                | 2               | 429      | 125,863    | 101                       | 9.6                                                          | 5,139                                  |\n| Seoni-M\u0101lw\u0101  | 490                  | 1               | 196      | 60,793     | 136                       | 12.0                                                         | 2,789                                  |\n| District total | 3,676                | 6               | 1,334    | 446,585    | 121                       | 9.8                                                          | 29,368                                 |\n\nThe figures for religion show that 84 per cent. of the population are Hindus, nearly 11 per cent. Animists, and 5 per cent. Muhammadans. Of the 22,000 Muhammadans, nearly half live in towns. The majority of the population speak the Bundeli dialect of Western Hindi, but in the H\u0101rd\u0101 tahsil the language presents some features of difference and is allied to the M\u0101lw\u012b dialect of R\u0101jput\u0101na. About half the Gonds and Kork\u016bs are shown as having abandoned their own languages.\n\nThese tribes are fairly strongly represented in the population, Gonds numbering nearly 49,000, or 11 per cent., and Kork\u016bs 22,500, or 5 per cent. The most important landholders are the Br\u0101hmans (34,000), who include families from both Hindust\u0101n and the Deccan, and also the local subdivision of N\u0101ramdeo or Narbad\u0101 Br\u0101hmans, who are priests of the various sacred places on the Narbad\u0101 and in villages, and also to a large extent patw\u0101ris or village accountants. The important cultivating castes are R\u0101jp\u016bts (28,000), G\u016bjars (22,000), and Raghu-vansis (7,000). Most of the R\u0101jp\u016bts are J\u0101dons or Jaduvansi of very impure descent. J\u0101ts, who have immigrated from Northern India, number 5,000. The menial and labouring classes are the Cham\u0101rs (20,000), Bal\u0101his (15,000), Mehr\u0101s (12,000), and Katias (10,000).\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In 1904, 38 villages with an area of 51 square miles and a population of 2,580 persons were transferred from the H\u0101rd\u0101 tahsil to Nim\u0101r District, and also 293 square miles of the K\u0101libh\u012bt 'reserved' forest. The adjusted District figures of area and population are 3,676 square miles and 446,585 persons.\nAbout 61 per cent. of the whole population are returned as dependent on agriculture.\n\nChristians number 2,706, of whom 2,301 are natives. The Friends Foreign Mission Association has stations at five places in the District, with a European staff numbering 36 members. Its converts number 1,200. Altogether 13 schools and 4 dispensaries have been established by this body; and in their workshops at Rasuli\u0101 near Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d, and at Leh\u012b near Seoni, numerous trades are taught. The Foreign Christian Missionary Society has stations at Hard\u0101 and Timurn\u012b, and supports a high school and middle school at the former place, besides two dispensaries and a leper asylum.\n\nThe prevailing soil of the District is the rich black alluvial loam of great depth and fertility which is characteristic of the Narbad\u0101 valley.\n\nAgriculture. The average depth is estimated at 10 feet, but in many places it exceeds 30 feet. Inferior soil is usually met with in undulating fields which have been denuded of the finer particles by scouring, or where the black soil is mixed with limestone pebbles or sand. A variety of sandy soil called sih\u0101r, which is formed from sandstone rock, produces only autumn crops, but responds to irrigation. The black soil of the Hard\u0101 and Seoni-M\u0101lw\u0101 tahsils is the most fertile, and that of Soh\u0101gpur the least, being especially subject to deterioration by the action of the numerous rivers which intersect the tahsil, and wash down sandy deposits from the hills. A small area of first-rate land round Pachlaora and Sobh\u0101pur must, however, be excepted. Sih\u0101r or regular sandy soil is also more common here than elsewhere. In the whole District the different kinds of black soil cover about 88 per cent. and sandy soil about 12 per cent. of the cultivated area. Wheat is generally grown in unembanked fields and without manure or rotation. When a field shows signs of exhaustion, gram is sown for a year or two, as this crop exercises a recuperative effect on the soil. As a rule autumn crops are grown only on the inferior soils, which will not support spring-crop grains; but the case of jow\u0101r, which is now sown on black soil, is an exception to this.\n\n1 Of the whole area of the District, 173 square miles are comprised in estates held on j\u0101gird\u0101r\u012b tenure; 73 square miles, formerly Government forest, are in process of settlement on the ryotw\u0101r\u012b system; and 103 square miles are held wholly or partially free of revenue from Government. An area of 22 square miles has been sold outright under the Waste Land Rules. The remaining area is held on the ordinary\n\n1 The agricultural statistics in this paragraph relate to the year 1903-4. In 1904 the area of Government forest was reduced to 922 square miles by transfer of the K\u0101libh\u012bt tract. In the statistics, 96 square miles of waste land which have not been cadastrially surveyed are excluded from the total area of the District.\nThe principal statistics of cultivation in 1903-4 are shown below, in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil     | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste | Forests |\n|------------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|---------|\n| Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d| 804   | 355        | 1         | 277              | 84      |\n| Hard\u0101      | 1,139 | 521        | 1         | 315              | 279     |\n| Soh\u0101gpur   | 1,243 | 397        | 1         | 347              | 433     |\n| Seoni-M\u0101lw\u0101| 490   | 232        | ...       | 138              | 126     |\n| **Total**  | **3,676** | **1,505** | **3**     | **1,077**        | **922** |\n\nPractically all the available land in the open country has been brought under the plough, and with the exception of a few isolated tracts there is little scope for extension of cultivation. A considerable quantity of land is under new and old fallow, the proportion amounting normally to about a fifth of the area occupied, and at present, owing to agricultural depression, to nearly 27 per cent. Fields are frequently, however, left fallow for the purpose of affording grazing to cattle. Wheat is the staple crop, with an area of 689 square miles, or 49 per cent. of the cropped area, while the crops next in importance are gram covering 200 square miles, jow\u0101r 56, til 79, and the small millets kodon and kulki 94. The severe disasters which have befallen the wheat crop, and the greater expense of its cultivation in view of the impoverished condition of the cultivators, have caused a decrease in the area under wheat. Only about 20 square miles are normally double cropped, the usual method being to get a catch-crop of pulse from an embanked wheat-field during the monsoon season. The betel-vine gardens of Soh\u0101gpur deserve mention. The leaf grown here has a good reputation and is sent outside the District.\n\nThe principal agricultural improvement is the embankment of fields for wheat. Some embankments have been made experimentally by Government, and a few leading landowners have adopted this method. The cultivation of cotton has increased in recent years. An agricultural farm has been started at Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d, for the demonstration of improved methods of wheat cultivation. An American winnowing machine has been introduced, and several have been sold to the cultivators. During the ten years following 1894 about Rs. 28,000 was borrowed under the Land Improvement Loans Act, and 3\u00b775 lakhs under the Agriculturists\u2019 Loans Act.\n\nThe cattle used in the District are to a large extent imported from the Native States of Indore, Gwalior, and Narsinghgarh, which occupy the M\u0101lw\u0101 plateau. The fair of S\u0101\u1e45kha in Narsinghgarh is the great market at which they are purchased, and they are commonly known as S\u0101\u1e45kha bullocks. They are large, strong, and sluggish, and generally white in colour. Cattle are also brought to a less extent\nfrom Nim\u0101r, this breed being preferred for use in carts as they are light and active. The cattle bred in Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d itself are inferior to those imported. Buffaloes are not used for cultivation, but those agriculturists who can afford it keep buffalo cows for the production of g\u0101h\u012b, which is an article of export. A Government cattle farm has recently been opened at Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d. The number of ponies has diminished in recent years.\n\nThe area irrigated from tanks is insignificant, consisting in 1903\u20134 of little more than 2,000 acres, which are mainly under vegetables and garden crops. In 1899\u20131900 it rose to 4,000 acres. A few hundred acres of wheat are also irrigated by means of wells. It is believed that the application of well-irrigation to wheat might be profitably extended. The practice of embanking wheat-fields, which may be considered a method of irrigation, is also growing; and though the crop in an embanked field is more liable to rust, this disadvantage is held to be more than counterbalanced by the increased out-turn, the saving in seed, and the greater facility of cultivation. The scope for tank-irrigation is limited.\n\nGovernment forests in 1903\u20134 covered 922 square miles, or 25 per cent. of the total area of the District. The forests are found almost entirely on the undulating and hilly country of the S\u0101tpur\u0101s, which bounds the Narbad\u0101 valley to the south.\n\nSituated at heights ranging from 1,200 to 4,000 feet above the sea, the character of the forests varies with both the elevation and the nature of the soil. On the dry rocky peaks and plateaux, especially when of sandstone formation, the principal species is salai (Boswellia serrata), mixed with stunted growths of other species. The middle and lower slopes of the hill belt form stretches of flat and undulating land fit for cultivation, alternating with mixed forest, the principal trees of which are teak and s\u0101j (Terminalia tomentosa), with other less valuable species. These forests contain frequent patches of grass land without trees, owing to the former practice of barr\u0101 or shifting cultivation and unrestricted fellings. Lastly, on the alluvial flats along rivers or on patches of red stony soil in the plains there is almost pure teak forest. Bamboos are fairly plentiful. The local consumption of forest produce comprises principally firewood, inferior timber, bamboos, and grass, while the exports consist of teak poles and scantlings, and bamboos. The demand is principally from Kh\u0101ndesh and Ber\u0101r. The forest revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 74,000, of which Rs. 28,000 was realized from sales of timber, Rs. 7,400 from fuel, and Rs. 14,000 from grass.\n\nNo mines are worked in Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d. Argentiferous galena occurs at Jog\u0101, and some old mines known locally as Ch\u0101ndi-kat\u0101n are still to be seen there. The excavations are in two parallel lines on a band\nof transition limestone. Silver exists in the galena to the extent of 21 ounces to the ton. At B\u0101gra an attempt was made to mine lead some years ago, but the metal was not found in sufficient quantities to make the undertaking profitable. Good red and white building stone is obtained near Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d town and Dh\u0101nd\u012bw\u0101ra, and is exported and sold to railway companies.\n\nMost of the cloth worn in the District is still woven locally, though mill-spun thread is solely used. The principal centres are Sobh\u0101pur and N\u0101harkol\u0101. Tasar silk was formerly woven at Soh\u0101gpur, but the industry is now extinct. There is a considerable dyeing industry at Soh\u0101gpur, the water of the river Pak\u0101km\u0101ti, which flows by the town, being considered to have special qualities. Foreign dyes have now supplanted the indigenous madder and safflower. Considerable quantities of cloth are imported from the mills and dyed locally. Indigo from Northern India is also used, and castor oil is brought from Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d for use in dyeing. Brass-working is carried on at Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d, Handi\u0101, and B\u0101bai. Ornamental iron betel-nut cutters made at Timurn\u012b are exported to other Districts. Bamboo walking-sticks are made at Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d. One cotton-ginning factory and three ginning and pressing factories are working at Hard\u0101, all of which have been opened since 1899. The four factories contain 136 gins and three presses, and the amount of capital invested in them is 3\u00b715 lakhs. Nearly 500 operatives are employed.\n\nWheat, til, linseed, and cotton are the staple exports of agricultural produce, and teak and other timber and myrabolams of forest produce. The exports of wheat have largely declined in recent years. The teak of R\u0101j\u0101bor\u0101ri and Bori is the best in the Central Provinces. Ghi is also exported to a considerable extent. Among minor articles are honey from the Pachmarhi hills, building and paving stone, brass vessels from Handi\u0101, and bamboo walking-sticks from Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d. Mahu\u0101 is sent to Khandw\u0101 for the manufacture of country liquor. Salt comes from Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d and in small quantities from the S\u0101mbhar Lake, sugar from Mirz\u0101pur and the Mauritius, gur from Bet\u016bl and Ber\u0101r, tobacco from Muzaffarpur, and rice from Chhatt\u012bsgarh, as the quantity grown locally is insufficient for consumption. It\u0101rsi, B\u0101bai, Handi\u0101, Sobh\u0101pur, and Bankheri are the chief weekly markets. Rahatgaon is a special market for timber.\n\nThe Great Indian Peninsula Railway traverses the entire length of the District from west to east, with a length of 122 miles and 22 stations within its limits. At It\u0101rsi the Indian Midland section branches off to the north and passes Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d town. Owing to its long narrow shape, nearly the whole District is thus within twenty miles of a railway. The principal trade routes are the It\u0101rsi-Bet\u016bl,\nHard\u0101-Handi\u0101, Hard\u0101-Bet\u016bl, Pipari\u0101-Chhindw\u0101ra, and Pipari\u0101-Sandi\u0101 roads. The District has 120 miles of metalled and 225 miles of unmetalled roads, and the annual expenditure on maintenance is Rs. 52,000. The Public Works department has charge of 177 miles of the most important roads, and the District council of the remainder. There are avenues of trees on 96 miles.\n\nUp to 1892 it was recorded that the agricultural population had been severely distressed in only six out of the preceding 220 years. On three of these occasions the distress was due wholly, and on one occasion partially, to political disturbances and the incursions of the Pind\u0101ris; while in the remaining two years, 1832 and 1888, the wheat crop was blighted by excessive rain. In spite of the abnormally small rainfall in 1868\u20139 there was no famine, the late rain in September and the capacity of the black cotton soil to retain moisture giving a fair wheat harvest. It is a local saying that the District is under the special protection of Mah\u0101deo and may suffer from excess, but never from deficiency, of rainfall. In 1894 and 1895 untimely rain in the autumn and cold season produced rust in the wheat, and the harvests were very poor. The rains of 1895 stopped prematurely, and the spring crops were poor; and this was followed in 1896 by a cessation of the monsoon at the end of August, and an out-turn of only one-third of the normal. Famine conditions prevailed from November, 1896, to December, 1897, 69,000 persons, or 14 per cent. of the population, being in receipt of assistance in April and the whole expenditure amounting to 16 lakhs. In 1899\u20131900 the monsoon again failed completely, and both harvests were destroyed. There was severe famine throughout 1900, the numbers in receipt of assistance rising in July to 118,000 persons, or nearly 24 per cent. of the population, and the total expenditure being 20 lakhs. The railway embankment was doubled along a certain length, and several useful feeder roads were constructed.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner has a staff of four executive Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioners. For administrative purposes the District is divided into four tahsils, each of which has a tahsild\u0101r and a naib-tahsild\u0101r. The Hard\u0101 and Seoni-M\u0101lw\u0101 tahsils form a subdivision with a Subdivisional officer residing at Hard\u0101, while Pachmarhi has a tahsild\u0101r and a Cantonment Magistrate. The Forest officer belongs to the Imperial Service, and the Executive Engineer of the Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d division, comprising the Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d, Nim\u0101r, and Bet\u016bl Districts, is stationed at Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d town.\n\nThe civil judicial staff consists of a District and three Subordinate Judges, and a Munsif at each tahsil. The Divisional and Sessions Judge of the Nerbudda Division has jurisdiction in Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d.\nLitigation is heavy, and at present consists almost entirely of suits for the recovery of loans on the security of valuables or immovable property. The District is almost free from professional criminals, but owing to its proximity to Native States is liable to raids by gangs of dacoits. Opium smuggling over the long border is also very common and rarely detected. Cases of cattle-lifting are not infrequent.\n\nDuring the early period of our administration the District did not include Hard\u0101. Several short-term settlements followed on the cession in 1818, which in Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d, as in the other northern Districts, were characterized by the mistake of over-assessment. After successive reductions of the revenue a twenty years' settlement was made by Major Ouseley in 1836, at which a moderate demand was fixed, the share of the Government being 66 per cent. of the 'assets.' On the expiration of the twenty years, a survey of the District preparatory to resettlement was begun in 1855, but operations had to be suspended on the outbreak of the Mutiny. The settlement was completed in 1865, being made by Mr. (now Sir Charles A.) Elliott, whose Report is one of the most interesting works relating to the Central Provinces. The revenue payable by the District, including Hard\u0101, before resettlement, was 3 lakhs, which was raised to 4.24 lakhs, or by 37 per cent., the period of the settlement being thirty years. On this occasion proprietary rights were conferred on the village headmen. During the currency of the settlement the general wealth and prosperity of the people increased very largely. Shortly after its conclusion the opening of the railway brought all parts of the District within easy distance of a market for their produce. Prices rose with a bound and the seasons were almost uniformly favourable. At the expiry of the thirty years the area under cultivation had increased by 38 per cent., the prices of grain had risen by 75 to 100 per cent., and the total rental of the tenants had been raised by the landowners by nearly 5 lakhs. The District was resettled between 1892 and 1896, the result being to increase the revenue by 3.68 lakhs, or 78 per cent. on the previous demand. For some years before and after the new settlement came into force the District was visited by a succession of failures of the valuable spring crops, on which its prosperity depends. The circumstances of the people were in consequence entirely altered, and while there has been a large decrease in the quantity and deterioration in the value of the crops sown, the cultivators have become involved in debt. Substantial relief was accordingly given, by the reduction of the revenue demand by 2.19 lakhs for a period of three years from 1901\u20132, and by Rs. 82,000 for the full period of settlement. The term of the new settlement is from twelve to fourteen years in different areas, a shorter period than twenty years having been adopted, in order to produce a regular rotation of District settlements.\nThe receipts of land revenue and total revenue are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 4.40   | 4.96   | 4.70   | 6.85   |\n| Total revenue  | 8.26   | 11.10  | 8.80   | 10.91  |\n\nThe management of local affairs, outside municipal areas, is entrusted to a District council and four local boards, each having jurisdiction over one taluk. The income of the District council in 1903-4 was Rs. 78,000, while the expenditure on education was Rs. 30,000 and on civil works Rs. 31,000. Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d, Soh\u0101gpur, Seoni-Malwa, Hard\u0101, and Pachmarhi are municipal towns.\n\nThe police force, in charge of the District Superintendent, consists of 581 officers and men, including 74 railway police and 10 mounted constables, besides 1,363 village watchmen, for 1,340 inhabited towns and villages. Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d town has a District jail, with accommodation for 168 prisoners, including 12 females.\n\nIn respect of education the District stands fifth in the Province, 4.6 per cent. of the population (8.8 males and 0.3 females) being able to read and write. The proportion of children under instruction to those of school-going age is 12 per cent. Statistics of the number of pupils are as follows: (1880-1) 3,778, (1890-1) 5,363, (1900-1) 8,039, (1903-4) 8,403, including 615 female scholars. The educational institutions comprise two high schools, five English and seven vernacular middle schools, and 129 primary schools. The high school at Hard\u0101, opened in 1900, is maintained by the Foreign Christian Missionary Society of America. The District contains nine girls\u2019 schools, consisting of a vernacular middle school at Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d town and eight primary schools. Ten boys\u2019 and five girls\u2019 schools are managed by missionary bodies. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 74,000, of which Rs. 60,000 was derived from Provincial and Local funds and Rs. 8,000 from fees.\n\nThe District has 11 dispensaries, with accommodation for 102 in-patients. In 1904 the number of cases treated was 68,292, of whom 756 were in-patients, and 1,528 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 19,000, mainly from Provincial and Local funds.\n\nVaccination is compulsory only in the municipal towns of Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d, Hard\u0101, Soh\u0101gpur, and Seoni. The percentage of successful vaccinations in 1903-4 was 29 per 1,000 of the District population, which is below the Provincial average.\n\n[C. A. Elliott, Settlement Report (1867); F. G. Sly, Settlement Report (1905).]\nHoshang\u0101b\u0101d Tahsil.\u2014Tahsil of Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d District, Central Provinces, lying between $22^\\circ 18'$ and $22^\\circ 52'$ N. and $77^\\circ 30'$ and $78^\\circ 5'$ E., with an area of 804 square miles. The population in 1901 was 125,071, compared with 137,811 in 1891. The density is 156 persons per square mile. The tahsil contains two towns, HOSHANG\u0100B\u0100D (population, 14,940), the head-quarters of the District and tahsil, and It\u0101rsi (5,769); and 309 inhabited villages. Excluding 84 square miles of Government forest, 65 per cent. of the available area is occupied for cultivation. The cultivated area in 1903-4 was 355 square miles. The demand for land revenue in the same year was Rs. 1,88,000, and for cesses Rs. 17,000. The tahsil consists of two well-marked tracts: on the north the Narbad\u0101 valley, a level open black-soil plain with a gentle slope from the Mah\u0101deo hills to the Narbad\u0101 river; and on the south the elevated Bordh\u0101 plateau, covered with light sandy soil and surrounded by hills.\n\nHoshang\u0101b\u0101d Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the District and tahsil of the same name, and also of the Nerbudda Division, Central Provinces, situated in $22^\\circ 46'$ N. and $77^\\circ 44'$ E., on the Indian Midland section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, 12 miles from It\u0101rsi junction and 476 miles from Bombay. The town is picturesquely placed along the southern bank of the Narbad\u0101 river, while north of the river stretch the Vindhyan Hills in Bhop\u0101l territory. Population (1901), 14,940.\n\nThe name of the place is derived from Hoshang Sh\u0101h Ghor\u012b, Sult\u0101n of M\u0101lw\u0101, who is said to have founded Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d in the fifteenth century. In 1802 it was occupied by Waz\u012br Mu\u1e25ammad, the well-known minister of Bhop\u0101l. He was defeated by a Mar\u0101th\u0101 army outside Soh\u0101gpur and hotly pursued into Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d. While making a stand outside the town a horse was killed under him; and he then mounted his celebrated crop-tailed horse, and escaped by leaping him over the battlements of the fort. A rude stone figure of a horse still marks the spot, and is locally venerated. Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d was taken by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s in 1809 after a three months' siege, and was occupied by British troops in 1817. It is now the head-quarters of the Commissioner and Divisional Judge, Nerbudda Division, and of an Executive Engineer, besides containing the usual District Staff. Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d was created a municipality in 1869. The municipal receipts during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 29,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 24,000, the principal item being octroi. The town has some local trade, and a brass-working industry is carried on. Bamboo walking-sticks are made and exported, and excellent building stone is obtained from a quarry in the vicinity. There is a printing press. Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d has a high school with 90 pupils, and several other schools. It is the head-quarters of the Friends Foreign Mission,\nwhich supports numerous medical and educational institutions, and has a technical school in a village near the town. Other institutions are a public dispensary and police hospital, and a veterinary dispensary. A Government agricultural farm and cattle-farm have recently been started.\n\n**Hoshiarpur District.** Submontane District in the Jullundur Division, Punjab, lying between $30^\\circ 59'$ and $32^\\circ 5'$ N. and $73^\\circ 30'$ and $76^\\circ 38'$ E., with an area of 2,244 square miles. Its eastern boundary consists of the western slopes of the Sola Singhi hills, a range of the Outer Himalayan system, which separates it from Kangra District and Bilaspur State, and whose highest elevation (3,896 feet) within the District is at Bharwain, its summer station. Parallel with this range and lying north-west-by-south-east runs the northern section of the Siwalik range, locally known as the Kat\u0101r Dh\u0101r. Between these ranges is the Jasw\u0101n or Una D\u016bn, a broad fertile valley, watered by the Soh\u0101n stream, which rises in its northern extremity and flows south-east until it falls into the Sutlej near Anandpur. The latter river, breaking through the Sola Singhi range near Bhabaur, flows south-east through the D\u016bn until at R\u016bpar it cuts through the Siwaliks and thence flows west. The south-east corner of the District, the Jandbhari il\u0101ka, lies on the left bank of the Sutlej; but that river forms its boundary on the extreme south-east and south, separating it from Amb\u0101la. On the north the Be\u0101s also breaks through the Sola Singhi hills, and sweeping round the northern end of the Siwaliks flows thence almost due south, dividing the District from Kangra on the north and Gurd\u0101spur on the west.\n\nHoshiarpur thus consists of a long, irregular oval, the Siwaliks forming its axis and dividing it into two unequal parts, of which the western is the larger. This part is a rich well-wooded submontane tract, which slopes south-westwards from the Siwaliks towards the borders of the Kap\u016brthala State and Jullundur District. It is watered by only two perennial streams of any size: namely, the western or Black Bein, which rises in the swamps near Das\u016bya and flows into Kap\u016brthala; and the eastern or White Bein, which rises near Garhshankar, and, after a short winding course through the tahsil of that name, turns sharply to the north and meanders along the Jullundur border. The principal feature of this submontane tract is the chos, or seasonal torrents, which, rising in the Siwaliks, spread like a network over the plain. At an earlier period the silt washed down from the Siwaliks must have formed the alluvial plain to their west and caused its fertility, but owing to the deforestation of those hills the chos have for a considerable time been destroying it. Dry in the rainless months, they become raging torrents after heavy rain: and, passing\nthrough the sandy belt which lies below the western slope of the hills, they enter the plain, at first in fairly well-defined channels, but finally spreading over its surface and burying the cultivation under infertile sand. At a special inquiry held in 1895\u20136, it was found that no less than 147 square miles were covered by these torrent-beds, an increase of 72 since 1852. The Punjab Land Preservation (Chos) Act (Act II of 1900) has been extended to the Siw\u0101lik, in order to enable the Local Government to limit the rights of grazing and wood-cutting as a preliminary step towards their reforestation, which, it is hoped, will remedy the damage now being caused by the hill torrents.\n\nGeologically, the District falls into two subdivisions: a south-western, composed of alluvium; and a north-eastern, comprising the Siw\u0101lik and sub-Him\u0101layan ranges running north-west from the Sutlej. These ranges are formed of the sandstones and conglomerates of the upper Siw\u0101lik series, which is of Upper Tertiary (pliocene) age.\n\nThe southern portion of the District hardly differs botanically from the general character of the Central Punjab, though the mango and other sub-tropical trees thrive particularly well in cultivation. The submontane part has a true Siw\u0101lik flora, and in one valley in the extreme north of the District the s\u0101l (*Shorea robusta*) finds its northern limit. The ber (*Zizyphus Jujuba*) is plentiful.\n\nWild animals include leopards (in the hills), hyenas, wolves, antelope, deer, &c. Feathered game is fairly plentiful.\n\nOwing to the proximity of the hills, the heat in the plains is never excessive, while Bharwain, the summer station of the District, enjoys a mild hot season. The chief cause of mortality is fever. Plague entered the District from Jullundur in 1897; and, in spite of considerable opposition culminating in a serious riot at Garhshankar, vigorous measures were for three years taken to stamp out the disease, and to some extent successfully.\n\nThe annual rainfall varies from 31 inches at Garhshankar to 34 at Hoshiarpur. Of the rainfall at the latter place, 28 inches fall in the summer months, and 6 in the winter. The greatest fall recorded of late years was 79 inches at Una in 1881\u20132, and the least 13 inches at Das\u016bya in 1901\u20132.\n\nTradition associates several places, notably Das\u016bya, with the P\u0101ndavas of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, but archaeological remains are few and unimportant. Prior to the Muhammadan invasions, the modern District undoubtedly formed part of the Katoch kingdom of Trigartta or Jullundur; and when at an unknown date that kingdom broke up into numerous petty principalities, the Jasw\u0101n R\u0101j\u0101s, a branch of the Katoch dynasty, established themselves\n\n---\n\n1 Medlicott, \u2018On the Sub-Him\u0101layan Ranges between the Ganges and R\u0101vi,\u2019 *Memoirs, Geological Survey of India*, vol. iii, pt. ii.\nin the Jasw\u0101n D\u016bn. The plains probably came permanently under Muhammadan rule on the fall of Jullundur in 1088, but the hills remained under Hindu chieftains. In 1399 Tim\u016br ravaged the Jasw\u0101n D\u016bn on his way to capture K\u0101ngra fort. At this period the Khokhars appear to have been the dominant tribe in the District; and in 1421 Jasrath, their chief, revolted against the weak Saiyid dynasty, but in 1428 he was defeated near K\u0101ngra. After that event several Path\u0101n military colonies were founded in the plain along the base of the Siwaliks, and Bajwara became the head-quarters. The fort of Malot, founded in the reign of Sult\u0101n Bahlol by a Path\u0101n grantee of the surrounding country, was Daulat Kh\u0101n\u2019s stronghold. It played an important part in B\u0101bar\u2019s invasion, and after its surrender B\u0101bar crossed the Siwaliks into the Jasw\u0101n D\u016bn and marched on R\u016bpar. Under Sher Sh\u0101h, the governor of Malot ruled all the hills as far as K\u0101ngra and Jammu, and organized some kind of revenue system. By this time the Dadw\u0101ls, another Katoch family, had established themselves at Dat\u0101rpur in the Siwaliks. On Akbar\u2019s accession, the District became the centre of Sikandar S\u016bri\u2019s resistance to the Mughal domination; but he was soon reduced, and in 1596 the Jasw\u0101ns were disposed of without actual fighting. After this the District settled down under the Mughal rule and was included in Todar Mal\u2019s great revenue survey.\n\nThe R\u0101j\u0101s of Jasw\u0101n and Dat\u0101rpur retained possession of their fiefs until 1759, when the rising Sikh adventurers, who had already established themselves in the lowlands, commenced a series of encroachments upon the hill tracts. The Jasw\u0101n R\u0101j\u0101 early lost a portion of his dominions; and when Ranjit Singh concentrated the whole Sikh power under his own government, both the petty Katoch chiefs were compelled to acknowledge the supremacy of Lahore. At last, in 1815, the ruler of Jasw\u0101n was forced by Ranjit Singh to resign his territories in exchange for an estate held on feudal tenure (j\u0101g\u012br); and three years later his neighbour of Dat\u0101rpur met with similar treatment. Meanwhile, the lowland portion of the District had passed completely into the hands of the Sikh chieftains, who ultimately fell before the absorbing power of Ranjit Singh; and by the close of 1818 the whole country from the Sutlej to the Be\u0101s had come under the government of Lahore. A small portion of the District was administered by deputies of the Sikh governors at Jullundur; but in the hills and the Jasw\u0101n D\u016bn, Ranjit Singh assigned most of his conquests to feudal rulers (j\u0101gird\u0101rs), among whom were the deposed R\u0101j\u0101s of Dat\u0101rpur and Jasw\u0101n, the Sodh\u012bs of Anandpur, and the Sikh prelate Bedi Bikram\u0101 Singh, whose head-quarters were fixed at Una. Below the Siwalik Hills, Sher Singh (afterwards Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101) held H\u0101jipur and Muker\u012b\u0101n, with a large tract of country, while other great tributaries\nreceived assignments elsewhere in the lowland region. Shaikh Sandhe Kh\u0101n had charge of Hoshiarpur at the date of the British annexation, as deputy of the Jullundur governor.\n\nAfter the close of the first Sikh War in 1846, the whole tongue of land between the Sutlej and the Be\u0101s, together with the hills now constituting Kangra District, passed into the hands of the British Government. The deposed R\u0101j\u0101s of Dat\u0101rpur and Jasw\u0101n received cash pensions from the new rulers, in addition to the estates granted by Ranjit Singh; but they expressed bitter disappointment that they were not restored to their former sovereign positions. The whole of Bedi Bikram\u0101 Singh\u2019s grant was resumed, and a pension was offered for his maintenance, but indignantly refused; while part of the Sodh\u012b estates were also taken back. Accordingly, the outbreak of the Mult\u0101n War and the revolt of Chattar Singh, in 1848, found the disaffected chieftains ready for rebellion, and gave them an opportunity for rising against the British power. In conjunction with the Kangra R\u0101j\u0101s, they organized a revolt, which, however, was soon put down without serious difficulty. The two R\u0101j\u0101s and the other ringleaders were captured, and their estates were confiscated. R\u0101j\u0101 Jagat Singh of Dat\u0101rpur lived for about thirty years at Benares on a pension from the British Government. Umed Singh of Jasw\u0101n received a similar allowance: Ran Singh, his grandson, was permitted to reside at Jammu in receipt of his pension; and on the assumption by Queen Victoria of the Imperial title in January, 1877, the j\u0101g\u012br confiscated in 1848 was restored to Tikka Raghu\u1e47\u0101th Singh, great-grandson of the rebel R\u0101j\u0101, and son-in-law of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 of Kashmir. Bedi Bikram\u0101 Singh followed Chattar Singh at Gujr\u0101t, but surrendered at the close of the war and obtained leave to reside at Amritsar. His son, Suj\u0101n Singh, receives a Government pension, and has been created an honorary magistrate. Many other local chieftains still retain estates, the most noticeable being the R\u0101n\u0101s of M\u0101nasw\u0101l and the Rais of Bhabaur. The sacred family of the Sodhus, lineal descendants of R\u0101m D\u0101s, the fourth Sikh Gur\u016b, enjoy considerable pensions.\n\nThe Mutiny did not affect this District, the only disturbances being caused by the incursion of servants from Simla, who spread exaggerated reports of the panic there, and the rapid march of a party of mutineers from Jullundur, who passed along the hills and escaped across the Sutlej before the news had reached head-quarters.\n\nThe population of the District at the last four enumerations was: (1868) 937,699, (1881) 901,381, (1891) 1,011,659, and (1901) 989,782, dwelling in 11 towns and 2,117 villages. It decreased by 2\u00b71 per cent. during the last decade, the decrease being greatest in the Hoshiarpur tahsil (3\u00b76) and least in Garhshankar. The density of the population is high.\nThe District is divided into the four tahsils of Hoshiarpur, Das\u016bya, Una, and Garhshankar, the head-quarters of each being at the place from which it is named. The chief towns are the municipalities of Hoshiarpur, the head-quarters of the District, Tanda-Urm\u0101r, Hari\u0101na, Garhd\u012bw\u0101la, Una, Anandpur, Mukerian, Das\u016bya, and Mi\u0101ni.\n\nThe following table shows the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil     | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Hoshiarpur | 508                  | 4               | 489      | 264,112    | 519\u00b79                     | -3\u00b76                                                         | 12,388                                 |\n| Das\u016bya     | 501                  | 4               | 633      | 239,004    | 477\u00b71                     | -2\u00b72                                                         | 6,952                                  |\n| Una        | 717                  | 2               | 523      | 225,108    | 314\u00b71                     | -1\u00b78                                                         | 11,680                                 |\n| Garhshankar| 509                  | 1               | 472      | 261,468    | 513\u00b77                     | -1\u00b70                                                         | 8,360                                  |\n| District total | 2,244              | 11              | 2,117    | 989,782    | 441\u00b70                     | -2\u00b71                                                         | 39,380                                 |\n\nNote.\u2014The figures for the areas of tahsils are taken from the revenue returns. The total District area is that given in the Census Report.\n\nHindus (603,710) comprise more than 60 per cent. of the total; Muhammadans number 312,958, or 32 per cent.; and Sikhs, 71,126, or 7 per cent. Punjabi is the language chiefly spoken.\n\nThe Jats or J\u0101ts (153,000) are first in point of numbers, comprising 15 per cent. of the total. They are chiefly Hindus, but include 35,000 Sikhs and 26,000 Muhammadans. The next most numerous are the R\u0101jputs (94,000), who comprise more than 9 per cent. of the population; they are mostly Hindus in the hills and Muhammadans in the plains. The G\u016bjars (78,000) are a pastoral people, who are found mainly in the Siw\u0101lkis. The Path\u0101ns (7,000) are descendants of colonists planted by the Afgh\u0101n invaders; their villages originated in small brick fortifications, and are disposed partly in a long line parallel to the Siw\u0101lkis, as a protection against invasion from the hills, partly in a cluster guarding the Sri Gobindpur ferry on the Be\u0101s. The Mahtons (10,000) are by their own account R\u0101jputs who have descended in the social scale owing to their practice of widow marriage. They are either Hindus or Sikhs. The Kanets (1,700) are said to have the same origin as the Mahtons, and are equally divided between Hindus and Sikhs. The Arains (35,000) and Sainis (45,000) are industrious and careful cultivators; the former are entirely Muhammadans, the latter Hindus or Sikhs. Other landowning tribes are the Aw\u0101ns (13,000) and Dogars (5,000), who are chiefly Muhammadans, and Ghirths (47,000), locally known as Bahtis and Ch\u0101hngs, who are almost entirely Hindus. The Br\u0101hmans (80,000) are extensive land-\nholders in the hills and also engage in trade. Of the commercial classes, the Khattris (21,000) are the most important. Of the menial tribes may be mentioned the Cham\u0101rs (leather-workers, 121,000), Ch\u016bhr\u0101s (scavengers, 19,000), Jhinwars (water-carriers, 24,000), Jul\u0101h\u0101s (weavers, 24,000), Kumh\u0101rs (potters, 11,000), Loh\u0101rs (blacksmiths, 16,000), Nais (barbers, 14,000), Tarkh\u0101ns (carpenters, 33,000), and Telis (oil-pressers, 12,000). About 60 per cent. of the population are dependent on agriculture.\n\nThe Ludhi\u0101na Mission has a station at Hoshi\u0101rpur, dating from 1867, and five out-stations in the District; its staff consists of 20 persons, with Scripture-readers and catechists, and includes a qualified lady doctor. The District contained 785 native Christians in 1901.\n\nThe Siw\u0101lik Hills, which form the backbone of the District, are for the most part soft sandstone, from which by detrition is formed a belt of light sandy loam known as the Kand\u012b tract, lying immediately at their foot. This soil requires frequent, but not too heavy, showers, and the tract is to a large extent overspread with shifting sand blown from the torrent beds. Parallel to this comes a narrow belt, in which the loam is less mixed with sand; and this is followed by the exceptionally fertile Sirw\u0101l belt, in which the spring-level is near the surface, and the loam, little mixed with sand except where affected by the hill torrents, is of a texture which enables it to draw up and retain the maximum of moisture. South-east of Garhshankar is a tract of clayey loam, probably an old depression connected with the Bein river, while north of Das\u016bya, and so beyond the range of the Siw\u0101lik denudation, is an area probably formed by the alluvion of the Be\u0101s, which is one of the most fertile in the District. The soil of the Una valley is for the most part a good alluvial loam, especially fertile on the banks of the Sutlej.\n\nThe District is held almost entirely on the bhaiy\u0101ch\u0101r\u0101 and pattid\u0101ri tenures, zamind\u0101ri lands covering only about 120 square miles. The area for which details are available in the revenue records of 1903\u20134 is 2,235 square miles, as shown below:\n\n| Tahsil     | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|------------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Hoshi\u0101rpur | 508   | 261        | 15        | 63               |\n| Das\u016bya     | 501   | 327        | 30        | 66               |\n| Una        | 717   | 267        | 6         | 98               |\n| Garhshankar| 509   | 291        | 40        | 48               |\n| **Total**  | **2,235** | **1,146** | **91**    | **275**          |\n\nThe chief crops of the spring harvest are wheat and gram, which occupied 452 and 225 square miles respectively in 1903\u20134. Barley\noccupied only 27 square miles. There were 154 acres of poppy. In the autumn harvest maize is the most important crop (212 square miles), and forms the staple food of the people; pulses occupied 81 square miles and rice 39. Very little great or spiked millet is grown. Sugar-cane is a very valuable crop, covering 38 square miles. Cotton occupied 27 square miles.\n\nThe cultivated area increased by about 3 per cent. during the twenty years ending 1901, its extension having been much hindered by the destructive action of the mountain torrents. Outside their range of influence, almost every cultivable acre is brought under the plough: cash rents rise to as much as Rs. 50 per acre, and holdings as small as half an acre are found. Maize is the only crop for which any pains are taken to select the best seed. Advances under the Land Improvement Loans Act are little sought after: in many places unbricked wells, dug at a trifling cost, answer every purpose, while in others the water lies too deep for masonry wells to be profitable. Even in the Sirw\u0101l tract, where there is a tendency to increase the number of masonry wells, they are more often dug in combination by a large number of subscribers, who each own a small holding, than by means of loans from Government.\n\nThe cattle are mostly small and weak, especially in the hills, and such good bullocks as are to be found are imported. Although Rajw\u0101ra and Tih\u0101ra are mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbar\u012b as famous for their horses, the breed now found is very poor. The District board maintains two pony and five donkey stallions. The people possess few sheep. Goats, which used to be grazed in the Siw\u0101liks in large numbers, and caused much damage, have now under the provisions of the Chos Act been excluded from the western slopes of that range. Camels are kept in a few villages. A good deal of poultry is bred for the Simla market.\n\nOf the total area cultivated in 1903-4, 91 square miles, or 8 per cent., were classed as irrigated. Of this, 57 square miles, or 63 per cent., were irrigated from wells: 23 square miles, or 25 per cent., from canals; and 11 square miles, or 12 per cent., from streams. There were 6,533 masonry wells and 7,511 unbricked wells, lever wells, and water-lifts. Except lever wells (which are worked by hand), these are worked by bullocks, generally with the Persian wheel, but occasionally with the rope and bucket. They are found chiefly in the Sirw\u0101l tract. Canal-irrigation is mainly from a private canal called the Sh\u0101h Nahr, an inundation cut taking off from the Be\u0101s in the north-west of the District. It was originally constructed during the decline of the Mughal empire, and was reopened in 1846 by a number of local landholders at their own expense. Government in 1890 acquired by agreement the management of the canal, subject to certain rights reserved to the share-\nholders. There are also some small cuts taking off from the Beas, which belong to private individuals and villages, and irrigate about 10 square miles. The irrigation from streams is by means of artificial watercourses, and is employed in some of the hilly tracts.\n\nThe District has 27 square miles of 'reserved' and 139 of unclassed forests under the Forest department, consisting of the forests of chil pine which cover the slopes of the Sola Singh range, and 10 square miles of bamboo forest in the Siwaliks. A small rakh of 3 square miles on the Outer Siwaliks is under the control of the Deputy-Commissioner. All the chil trees on these hills are also the property of Government. The inner slopes are sparsely clad with pine; the denudation of the outer slopes by the action of the hill torrents has already been referred to. In 1903-4 the forest revenue was Rs. 19,000.\n\nGold is washed in the bed of the Soh\u0101n and other hill streams, but in quite insignificant quantities, the average earnings of the workers not amounting to more than 3 annas a day. The District contains quarries of limestone of some value, and kankar of an inferior quality is found. Saltpetre is extracted from saline earth in fourteen villages, the output being about 140 maunds a year. There are some valuable quarries of sandstone.\n\nThe principal manufacture is that of cotton fabrics, which in 1901 employed 44,000 persons. The chief articles are coloured turbans and cloth with coloured stripes. Hoshiarpur Town is a centre for the manufacture of ivory or bone and copper inlay work and of decorative furniture, but the demand for inferior work in Europe and America has led to deterioration. Lacquered wooden ware and silver-work, with some ivory-carving, are also produced. The carpenters have a reputation for good work, and there is a considerable manufacture of glass bangles. Ornamented shoes are also made, and buskins, breeches, and coats of soft sambhar (deer) skin. At Das\u016bya cups and glasses of coloured glass are made. Light 'paper' pottery is made at Tanda, and brass vessels at Bah\u0101durpur.\n\nTrade is chiefly confined to the export of raw materials, including rice, gram, barley, sugar, hemp, safflower, fibres, tobacco, indigo, cotton, lac, and a small quantity of wheat. Of these, sugar forms by far the most important item. The cane grows in various portions of the plains, and sugar is refined in the larger towns and exported to all parts of the Punjab, especially to Amritsar. The principal imports are cotton piece-goods from Delhi and Amritsar, millets and other coarse grains from the south of the Sutlej, and cattle from Amritsar and the south.\n\nThe District contains no railways, but a line from Jullundur to Hoshiarpur is contemplated. The road from Jullundur to Kangra runs across the District, and transversely to this two lines of road, one\non either side of the Siwaliks, carry the submontane traffic between the Beas and Sutlej. The total length of metalled roads is 37 miles, and of unmetalled roads 737 miles. Of these, 21 miles of metalled and 28 miles of unmetalled roads are under the Public Works department, and the rest under the District board. The Sutlej is navigable below Rupar during the summer months, and the Beas during the same period from the point where it enters the District. The Sutlej is crossed by six and the Beas by ten ferries, nine of which are managed by the District board.\n\nNone of the famines which have visited the Punjab since annexation affected Hoshiarpur at all seriously; the rainfall is generally so plentiful and the soil so moist that a great part of the District is practically secure from drought. The area of crops matured in the famine year 1899-1900 amounted to 7.6 per cent. of the normal.\n\nThe District is in charge of a Deputy-Commissioner, aided by five Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioners, of whom one is in charge of the District treasury. For general administrative purposes the District is divided into four tahsils\u2014Hoshiarpur, Garhshankar, Una, and Dasuva\u2014each with a tahsildar and a naib-tahsildar.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner as District Magistrate is responsible for criminal justice, and civil judicial work is under a District Judge. Both officers are supervised by the Divisional Judge of the Hoshiarpur Civil Division. There are six Munsifs, three at head-quarters and one at each outlying tahsil. The predominant form of crime is burglary.\n\nUnder Sikh rule the District was unusually fortunate, in that Misr Rup Lal was appointed to the administration of the doab in 1802. He was able and honest, allied to local families by marriage, and interested in the welfare of the people. His assessments were light and easily paid. In 1839 he was succeeded by a different type of ruler, Shaikh Ghulam Muhi-ud-din, whose oppressive administration lasted until the British conquest. The summary settlement of the whole doab was promptly made on annexation by John Lawrence. The demand was 13\u00bd lakhs. Except in Garhshankar, the summary settlement worked well. In 1846 the regular settlement of Jullundur and Hoshiarpur began. Changes in officers and the pressure of other work prevented anything being done until 1851, when a Settlement officer was appointed to Hoshiarpur. His charge, however, did not correspond with the present District, as other officers settled the Una tahsil, part of Garhshankar, and the Mukeri\u00e1n tract. The result for the District as now constituted was an increased demand of Rs. 9,000. Many assignments of revenue, however, had in the meantime been resumed, and the assessment was really lighter than the summary demand. Between 1869 and 1873 a revision of the records-of-rights in the hilly tracts was\ncarried out. The settlement was revised between 1879 and 1882. The total revenue assessed was 134 lakhs, of which Rs. 71,000 are 'assigned,' while a water rate was imposed on the lands irrigated by the Sh\u0101h Nahr Canal. Government subsequently took over the canal, and the shareholders became annuitants, receiving 8 annas out of every 18 annas imposed as water rate. The canal is managed by the Deputy-Commissioner, and all profits are earmarked to the improvement and extension of the watercourses. The average assessment on 'dry' land is Rs. 1\u201315 (maximum Rs. 4\u20134, minimum 6 annas), and that on 'wet' land Rs. 4\u20138 (minimum Rs. 6, minimum Rs. 3). The demand for 1903\u20134, including cesses, was 16\u00b74 lakhs. The average size of a proprietary holding is 1\u00b75 acres.\n\nThe collections of land revenue alone and of total revenue are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880\u20131 | 1890\u20131 | 1900\u20131 | 1903\u20134 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 12,60  | 13,65  | 13,57  | 13,74  |\n| Total revenue  | 15,84  | 17,89  | 19,93  | 22,36  |\n\nThe District possesses nine municipalities, Hoshiarpur, T\u0101nda-Urm\u0101r, Hari\u0101na, Garhd\u012bw\u0101la, Una, Anandpur, Mukeri\u0101n, Das\u016bva, and Mi\u0101ni; and one 'notified area,' Kh\u0101npur. Outside these, local affairs are managed by the District board, which in 1903\u20134 had an income of Rs. 1,67,000. The expenditure in the same year was Rs. 1,49,000, education being the largest item.\n\nThe regular police force consists of 480 of all ranks, including 93 municipal police. The Superintendent usually has three inspectors under him. The village watchmen number 1,765. There are 15 police stations and 4 road-posts. The District jail at head-quarters has accommodation for 106 prisoners.\n\nThe District stands twelfth among the twenty-eight Districts of the Province in respect of the literacy of its population. In 1901 the proportion of literate persons was 4 per cent. (7\u00b73 males and 0\u00b72 females). The number of pupils under instruction was 4,813 in 1880\u20131, 9,749 in 1890\u20131, 9,639 in 1900\u20131, and 10,772 in 1903\u20134. In the last year the District had 13 secondary and 146 primary (public) schools, and 3 advanced and 75 elementary (private) schools, with 278 girls in the public and 315 in the private schools. The Hoshiarpur municipal high school was founded in 1848 to teach Persian and Hindi, and was brought under the Educational department in 1856. The study of English was introduced in 1859, Arabic and Sanskrit in 1870, at about which time it was made a high school. There are also three unaided Anglo-veracular high schools, one vernacular high school, and eight middle schools. The Ludhi\u0101na Mission\nsupports a girls' orphanage and boarding-school, and two day-schools for Hindu and Muhammadan girls. The total number of pupils in public institutions in 1904 was about 7 per cent. of the number of children of school-going age. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 74,000, the greater part of which was met from Local funds.\n\nThe civil hospital at Hoshiarpur has accommodation for 33 male and 12 female in patients. The District also contains fourteen outlying dispensaries. At these institutions in 1904 a total of 145,455 out-patients and 1,170 in-patients were treated, and 9,267 operations were performed. Local funds contribute nearly three-fourths of the expenditure, which in 1904 amounted to Rs. 24,000, and municipal bodies the remaining fourth. The Ludhi\u0101na Mission has recently opened a female hospital in Hoshiarpur under a qualified lady doctor.\n\nThe number of successful vaccinations in 1903-4 was 29,000, representing 29 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n[H. A. Rose, *District Gazetteer* (1904); J. A. L. Montgomery, *Settlement Report* (1885).]\n\n**Hoshiarpur Tahsil.**\u2014Western tahsil of Hoshiarpur District, Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 21' and 31\u00b0 50' N. and 75\u00b0 40' and 76\u00b0 7' E., with an area of 508 square miles. The population in 1901 was 264,112, compared with 273,864 in 1891. It contains the towns of Hoshiarpur (population, 17,549), the head-quarters, Garhdiw\u0101la (3,652), Hari\u0101na (6,005), and Kh\u0101npur (3,183); and 489 villages, including Bajw\u0101ra, a place of some historical interest. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to 4.3 lakhs. The tahsil comprises the western slopes of the Siwaliks, the poor land at their base, a central strip of fairly productive but sandy soil, and in the west a broad belt of fertile land irrigated by wells. It is well wooded, and the mango groves are a characteristic feature. Torrent-beds, dry except after heavy rain, are met with every few miles.\n\n**Hoshiarpur Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the District and tahsil of Hoshiarpur, Punjab, situated in 31\u00b0 32' N. and 75\u00b0 52' E., at the foot of the Siwaliks, on the Jullundur-Dharm\u0101la road, 25 miles from Jullundur. The Divisional and Sessions Judge of the Hoshiarpur Civil Division has his head-quarters here. Population (1901), 17,549. The town was seized in 1809 by Ranjit Singh, and formed the head-quarters of the governors of the Jullundur Do\u0101b. It is famous for the production of articles of wood inlaid with ivory. The municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 47,500, and the expenditure Rs. 47,400. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 58,600, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 44,900. It maintains a high school, the management\nof which was taken over by the Educational department in 1904. There are two other unaided high schools in the town, which also possesses a civil hospital; and the Ludhi\u0101na Mission maintains a female hospital.\n\n**Hoskote.**\u2014Eastern taluk of Bangalore District, Mysore, lying between 12\u00b0 51' and 13\u00b0 15' N. and 77\u00b0 38' and 77\u00b0 59' E., with an area of 272 square miles. The population rose from 60,667 in 1891 to 73,855 in 1901. The taluk contains two towns, Hoskote (population, 3,184) and S\u016blibele (2,186); and 365 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,55,000. The Ponnaiy\u0101r is the western boundary towards the north, and, forming the large Hoskote tank, runs through the south of the taluk. Except for a few low hills in the north, the country is open. Along the river and east from Nandagudi the best cultivation is found. Some potatoes are grown, and poppy used to be grown formerly. Hay is made near Hoskote for the Bangalore market. Hoskote town, the head-quarters, is situated in 13\u00b0 4' N. and 77\u00b0 48' E., on the Ponnaiy\u0101r, 6 miles from Whitefield railway station. Hosa-kote, the 'new fort,' so called to distinguish it from Kolar, was built about 1595 by the Sugat\u016br chief, who also made the large tank, 10 miles in circumference when full.\n\n**Hospet Subdivision.**\u2014Subdivision of Bellary District, Madras, consisting of the Hospet, Hadagalli, K\u016bdligi, and Harpanahalli taluks.\n\n**Hospet Taluk.**\u2014Western taluk of Bellary District, Madras, lying between 15\u00b0 0' and 15\u00b0 29' N. and 76\u00b0 17' and 76\u00b0 48' E., with an area of 540 square miles. The population in 1901 was 101,947, compared with 92,512 in 1891. The taluk contains two towns, Hospet (population, 18,482), the head-quarters, and Kampli (9,803); and 121 villages. Of the villages the best known is Hampi, which has given its name to the wonderful ruins of the old city of Vijayanagar which lie scattered around. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 2,08,000. Containing the rugged wildernesses of granite hills round Daroji and Kampli and many outliers from the Sand\u016br and Copper Mountain ranges, Hospet is the most hilly area in the District. Nine-tenths of it is covered with light mixed soils. Only one-twelfth is black cotton soil, and even this is scattered in many isolated patches and does not occur in any one continuous spread. Kanarese is the prevailing vernacular. It is the only part of Bellary of which any considerable proportion is protected from drought in all seasons, 14 per cent. of the cultivated area, most of which is supplied by the Tungabhadra channels, being safe from famine. It consequently suffered less in the distress of 1876-8 than any other part of the District. Some of this irrigated land is very valuable; it is reported that fields round Kampli have changed hands at prices\nworking out at Rs. 1,200 per acre. Much of it, however, is malarious, and some of the villages near Hospet town are almost deserted, the people being compelled by fever to live elsewhere. Sugar-cane and rice are the chief crops raised on the irrigated land, the area under sugar-cane being considerably more than half of the total under that crop in the whole District. Owing to the many hills, the proportion of the total area which is arable is lower than in any other taluk.\n\n**Hospet Town** ('New town').\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision and taluk of the same name in Bellary District, Madras, situated in $15^\\circ 16'$ N. and $76^\\circ 24'$ E., on the Southern Mahratta Railway. A branch line has been built from here to Kotturu. Population (1901), 18,482. The town consists of one long market street, with a temple at the end and a number of small lanes opening off it. The chief merchants live in the suburb of Chittav\u0101digi, which is the centre of trade for the western taluks of the District. Owing partly to the fever which is gradually invading the western portion of Chittav\u0101digi and partly to the existence of the railway station in Hospet, Chittav\u0101digi is extending eastwards to join the rest of the town. The fever is worst on the land irrigated by channels from the Tungabhadra. More than one village among the 'wet' fields has been almost entirely deserted; and even the farm-labourers frequently live in Hospet or Chittav\u0101digi, and go out daily to their work rather than reside on the irrigated land. Mainly owing to this fact, the population of Hospet advanced by more than 40 per cent. during the ten years ending 1901. The chief industry is cotton-weaving. There is a native tannery, and five or six families make brass toe-rings, bangles, cattle-bells, &c. The trade in jaggery (coarse sugar), most of which goes by rail towards Bombay, is large; but the decline in price, due to the competition of sugar refined by European processes, has affected it adversely. The jaggery is made from the cane irrigated by the Tungabhadra channels. So universal is the use of iron cane-crushing mills, that two native smiths in Hospet have learnt to make and repair them. They procure the necessary castings, &c., from Madras and adjust them and put them together. One of them employs a lathe worked by bullock-power. Conspicuous objects in the town are three stone Muhammadan tombs east of the bazar-street, known locally as the three mosques, and two other similar erections near the divisional officer's bungalow.\n\nThe town was built by the Vijayanagar king Krishna Deva between 1509 and 1520 in honour of N\u0101gal\u0101devi, a courtesan whom he had known in his youth, and whom he married after he became king. He called it, after her, N\u0101gal\u0101pur, and it was his favourite residence. In his time it was the entrance gate, as it were, to the city of Vijayanagar for all travellers coming from Goa and the west coast. Krishna Deva also made the enormous embankment south of the town, connect-\ning the ends of the two parallel ranges of hills which farther south enclose the valley of Sand\u016br. It was carried out with the aid of Jo\u00e3o de la Ponte, a Portuguese engineer whose services had been lent by the Governor-General of Goa. Immediately south of Hospet, at the northern end of the big embankment, rises a prominent hill of a curious conical shape with smooth grass-covered sides, which is called the Joladar\u0101si, or \u2018heap of cholam.\u2019 The youth among the local Boyas used to back themselves to run up it without stopping, carrying a bag of grain on their shoulders. Farther east along this same range is the bold peak of Jambun\u0101th Konda (2,980 feet above the sea); and halfway up this, in a very picturesque glen, standing on a broad artificial terrace, is the temple of Jambun\u0101th. From Hospet to the foot of the hill is about 3 miles, and a paved way leads up to the temple.\n\n**Hos\u016br Subdivision.**\u2014Subdivision of Salem District, Madras, consisting of the Hos\u016br, Krishnagiri, and Dharmapuri taluks.\n\n**Hos\u016br Taluk.**\u2014Northern taluk of Salem District, Madras, lying between 12\u00b0 9' and 12\u00b0 54' N. and 77\u00b0 29' and 78\u00b0 16' E., with an area of 1,217 square miles. The northern and western portions are on the high level of the Mysore plateau, and form a bare and uninteresting tract. In the south and east the country is full of beauty, being a series of plateaux sustained by lines of forest-clad hills and sinking by rapid descents down to the valley of the Cauvery. The taluk is the most thinly peopled portion of the District; but at the Census of 1901 it contained a population of 184,971, compared with 155,768 in 1891, the increase, at the rate of nearly 19 per cent., being the most rapid in the District. Much of the country is covered with jungle, and is the rearing-ground of the so-called Mysore breed of cattle. The climate on the table-land is cool and pleasant, resembling that of Bangalore. The taluk contains one town, Hos\u016br (population, 6,695), the headquarters of the subdivision and the taluk. The number of villages is 750. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 2,49,000.\n\n**Hos\u016br Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision and taluk of the same name in Salem District, Madras, situated in 12\u00b0 44' N. and 77\u00b0 50' E. The nearest railway station is Mal\u016br on the Bangalore branch of the Madras Railway, 20\u00bd miles by a good road. It is also easily accessible from Bangalore, 24 miles distant. Population (1901), 6,695. To the west of the town stands an old fort, mentioned frequently in the history of the wars with Tipu Sult\u0101n, and supposed to have been built for Tip\u016b by an English engineer named Hamilton. He and two other prisoners were barbarously beheaded on the approach of Lord Cornwallis\u2019s army in 1791. The divisional officer\u2019s bungalow, locally called the Castle, was built at great cost by a former Collector, Mr. Brett (1859\u201362), when Hosur was the head-quarters of\nthe District. It is in the style of an English mediaeval castle, with turrets, battlements, a moat, &c. It was purchased by Government in 1875 for Rs. 10,000.\n\nFour miles south of the town, at Mattagiri, is the Hos\u00fbr Remount D\u00e9pot, from which the Ninth Division of the army in India is supplied with cavalry and artillery horses. This dates from 1828, and is in charge of a British officer assisted by a subaltern of the Army Veterinary department. The greater number of the horses are Australians bought from the importers at Madras. They are acclimatized and broken to their work at the d\u00e9p\u00f4t. The place has a wonderfully English appearance, the grassy paddocks being surrounded with post-and-rail fences and entered by gates of familiar pattern, and much of the work on the farm is done by horses instead of bullocks.\n\n**Hotgi.**\u2014Village in the District and taluka of Shol\u00e2pur, Bombay, situated in $17^\\circ 36' N.$ and $75^\\circ 58' E.$, 9 miles south-east of Shol\u00e2pur city. Population (1901), 3,918. It is the junction of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway with the Hotgi-Gadag section of the Southern Mahratta line. The village contains a dispensary belonging to the Southern Mahratta Railway.\n\n**Hoti Mard\u00e2n.**\u2014Town in Pesh\u00e2war District, North-West Frontier Province. See MARD\u00c2N.\n\n**Howrah District** (*H\u00e1bara*).\u2014Small District in the Burdw\u00e2n Division of Bengal, lying between $22^\\circ 13'$ and $22^\\circ 47'$ N. and $87^\\circ 51'$ and $88^\\circ 22'$ E., with an area of 510 square miles. Howrah, which is a separate magisterial charge, is for revenue purposes subordinate to Hooghly District, by which it is bounded on the north; its western and eastern boundaries are the R\u00fapn\u00e2r\u00e1yan and the Hooghly rivers, which separate it from Midnapore and the Twenty-four Parganas and meet at its southern angle.\n\nThe District is intersected from north to south by the D\u00e2m\u00f4dar, which falls into the Hooghly opposite Falta Point. There are many small streams and watercourses, the principal being\n\nPhysical aspects. the K\u00e2na D\u00e2m\u00f4dar, a tributary of the river of that name, which rises near T\u00e2rakeswar in Hooghly District, and falls into the D\u00e2m\u00f4dar at Amt\u00e2; the Saraswati, at one time the main channel of the Ganges but now merely a branch of the Hooghly, which it leaves near Tribeni and, after flowing southwards through Howrah, rejoins at S\u00e2nkrail; and the Ga\u00eeghata Bakshi Kh\u00e2l, which connects the R\u00fapn\u00e2r\u00e1yan and D\u00e2m\u00f4dar. The District is studded with depressions lying between the larger rivers, the most important being the R\u00e2j\u00e2pur marsh between the Hooghly and D\u00e2m\u00f4dar, which is now being gradually drained; towards the south the country lies so low as to require protection by costly Government and private embankments.\nThe surface is covered with alluvium, consisting chiefly of sandy clay and sand.\n\nThe vegetation is composed almost exclusively of the aquatic and marsh plants to be met with in rice-fields, such as *Hydrilla*, *Utricularia*, *Caculia*, or of those semi-spontaneous plants that form the village shrubberies of Central Bengal, such as *Glycosmis*, *Trema*, *Urena*, *Solanum*, *Datura*, *Leonotis*, and the like. Waste places are generally covered with a weedy vegetation; and one of the striking features is the extent to which such weeds as occur in these places are exotic so far as Bengal is concerned, many of them, such as *Scoparia*, *Ageratum*, *Evolvulus nummularius*, and *Peperomia pellucida*, being originally natives of America.\n\nWild hog abound in the south, and a stray leopard is occasionally seen.\n\nHumidity is high but the rainfall is rarely excessive, the average yearly total being 57 inches, of which 5\u00b75 inches fall in May, 10\u00b72 in June, 12 in July, 12\u00b73 in August, and 8\u00b71 in September. The climate resembles that of Calcutta and the Twenty four Parganas; separate statistics of temperature are not available.\n\nThe District is subject to floods, owing to the sudden rising of the D\u0101modar and R\u016bpn\u0101r\u0101y\u0101n rivers; and destructive inundations occurred in 1823, 1833, and 1864. Embankments were formerly maintained along both banks of the D\u0101modar; but they were breached almost every year, and those along the right bank were eventually abandoned in order to preserve those on the left bank of the river. In September, 1900, an abnormal rainfall of 24 inches in 48 hours caused extensive floods. Many cattle were drowned, and hundreds of houses destroyed, and the rice crop was ruined over an area of 150 square miles. Destructive cyclones occurred in 1832, 1833, 1842, and 1864, the last wrecking several vessels on the Hooghly. The great earthquake of 1897 caused much damage to brick-built houses in Howrah city.\n\nHowrah, with the rest of the Burdw\u0101n Division and the District of B\u012brbh\u016bm, formed part of the old Hindu province of Bengal known as R\u0101rh, but very little authentic information exists regarding its early history. The neighbourhood of Howrah city has long been a centre of European trade. When the Portuguese began to frequent the Hooghly river, about 1530, an important mart sprang up at Betor, close to Sibpur, where goods were transhipped from their vessels into small boats in which they were carried to S\u0101tgaon, near the modern town of Hooghly. Betor was abandoned towards the end of the sixteenth century in favour of S\u016bt\u0101nuti, the site of the modern Calcutta. In 1687 Job Charnock settled temporarily at Ulub\u0101ria before he founded Calcutta. In 1819 Hooghly and Howrah were separated from Burdw\u0101n, of which they\nhad previously formed part, and made into a separate District. Howrah is still an apanage of Hooghly for revenue purposes, but in 1843 it was constituted a separate magisterial charge.\n\nThe population increased from 635,878 in 1872 to 675,394 in 1881, to 763,625 in 1891, and to 850,514 in 1901. Malaria is prevalent in rural areas owing to the bad drainage, and the mortality from cholera, dysentery, and diarrhoea is also high. Details of the population in 1901 for each subdivision are shown below:\n\n| Subdivision | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|----------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Howrah      | 173                  | 2              | 365      | 431,257    | 2,493                     | + 17.7                                          | 52,136                                 |\n| Ulubaria    | 337                  |                | 1,086    | 419,257    | 1,244                     | + 5.5                                           | 45,865                                 |\n| District total | 510                 | 2              | 1,451    | 850,514    | 1,668                     | + 11.4                                          | 98,001                                 |\n\nNote.\u2014Ulubaria town has been created a municipality since the Census of 1901.\n\nIn 1901 a fifth of the population was urban, dwelling in the two towns of Howrah and Bally, which are industrial suburbs of Calcutta. In the whole District there are 1,668 persons to the square mile; excluding Howrah and Bally the density is 1,351, which is still greater than that of any other District in Bengal. Nearly half the increase in the decade ending 1901 was due to the exceptional expansion of Howrah City. Howrah gains largely by immigration from all the neighbouring Districts, except Calcutta, and also from the United Provinces and Bihar. Most of these immigrants are attracted by the mills, iron-works, and other industries in Howrah city, and barely a third of the inhabitants of this busy manufacturing centre are District born. The local vernacular is the dialect of Central Bengal. Hindus number 672,544, or 79 per cent. of the total, and Muhammadans 175,123, or 20.6 per cent.; among the remainder are 2,588 Christians.\n\nNearly all the Muhammadans are Shaikhs, while Kaibarttas (231,000), the great race-caste of Midnapore, constitute more than two-thirds of the Hindus. Br\u0101hmans (52,000) and the semi-aboriginal B\u0101gdis (73,000) are also numerous. Of the total population, 42 per cent. are supported by agriculture, 26 per cent. by industries, 2.3 per cent. by commerce, and 3.7 per cent. by the professions. The proportion of agriculturists is lower, and that of the industrial population higher, than in any District outside Calcutta, many of the people, even in the rural areas, going daily to work in the metropolis.\n\nThe majority of the Christians are Europeans and Eurasians\nemployed in Howrah city; and in 1901 native Christians numbered only 579. The Church of England Zan\u0101na Mission maintains three girls' schools in Howrah attended by 327 pupils, and a Baptist Mission and a branch of the Oxford University Mission also work there. The Church Missionary Society supports a resident missionary for evangelistic work among the Hindi-speaking population. A small American Mission belonging to a community calling itself 'The Church of God' is established in Ulub\u0101ria.\n\nThe agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are shown below, in square miles:\n\n| Subdivision | Total | Cultivated | Cultivable waste |\n|-------------|-------|------------|------------------|\n| Howrah      | 173   | 58         | 7                |\n| Ulub\u0101ria    | 337   | 126        | 16               |\n| **Total**   | **510** | **178**    | **23**           |\n\nOwing to the silt deposited by the rivers, the soil is very fertile. The staple product is rice, the winter crop being by far the most important, but wheat, barley, maize, mustard, jute, and hemp are also grown. Fodder is abundant, though there are few regular pasture-grounds. A market held at Ulub\u0101ria every Saturday is largely frequented by dealers in cattle and poultry. Six fairs are held to which agricultural produce is brought for sale, the chief being the R\u0101m Krishna Paramhansa mela. The District is not liable to famine, and the people as a whole are so well off that there is no need for advances under the Loans Acts, except when the crops are damaged by floods.\n\nThe Howrah, R\u0101japur, and Barajal\u0101 drainage schemes described below serve also for irrigation purposes in years of drought, when water is let in from the rivers. Some lands on the banks of the K\u0101na D\u0101modar are occasionally watered from the Eden Canal.\n\nDomestic industries are few and unimportant. Hand-made paper of an inferior quality is produced on a small scale in the Amt\u0101 th\u0101na. Silkworms are still reared in some parts, the thread being taken to Calcutta and Gh\u0101t\u0101l for sale; but the industry is dying out, the annual value of the silk being estimated at only Rs. 12,500. Earthenware articles are made throughout the District, and the pottery of S\u0101nkrail, Patih\u0101l Chandipur, and Bally has a local repute, the annual out-turn being valued at Rs. 1,17,030. Tiles are made at Barrackpur in the Bally th\u0101na.\n\nBut, if home industries are insignificant, the case is far otherwise with industries dependent on European methods and worked with European capital. The bank of the Hooghly is lined with no less than 56 factories, employing 51,000 hands. These include 6 cotton-mills, 9 jute-mills, 7 jute-presses, 2 paper-mills, 3 flour-mills, 5 rail-\nway workshops, 4 engineering workshops, 4 iron-works, 4 rope-works, 4 dockyards, 2 salt-crushing mills, a printing press, lime-works, and cement-works. In 1903\u20134 the cotton-mills contained 176,100 spindles, employed 4,400 hands, and turned out 18,000,000 lb. of goods valued at 56 lakhs. The jute-mills with 84,000 spindles and 4,060 looms employed 27,000 hands, and manufactured goods to the value of 251 lakhs. The paper-mills at Bally produced paper worth 13\u00bd lakhs.\n\nIn addition to the larger iron-works mentioned above, 16 small firms managed by native agency purchase pig-iron and scrap-iron in Calcutta, and manufacture weights, sugar-cane presses, rollers, bolts, plant for oil- and jute-mills, building and carriage material, railings, iron safes, &c., the out-turn being valued in 1901 at 1\u00b739 lakhs. Bricks are extensively manufactured along the right bank of the Hooghly and the Bally Kh\u0101l, where 91 brick-fields employ 2,660 hands and produce an out-turn valued at nearly 4 lakhs. About a third of the brick-fields are worked by native methods, but the use of pug-mills and Bull\u2019s patent kilns is spreading.\n\nFor commercial purposes the District forms part of Calcutta. Howrah city is the terminus of the East Indian and Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railways, which connect Calcutta with Upper India, with Bombay, and with N\u0101gpur and Madras. The chief articles of export are rice, vegetables, betel-leaf, sugar-cane, wheat, flour, coco-nuts, hukkas, hides, cotton cloth, cotton twist, silk, bricks, and ropes. The chief imports are rice, wheat, pulses, oilseeds, European piece-goods, kerosene oil, jute, hemp, gh\u012b, sugar, spices, cotton, cotton twist and yarn, wine and other liquors, salt, tobacco, timber, iron, straw, potatoes, shoes, and glass. The chief centres of trade are HOWRAH CITY, BALLY, GHUSUR\u012a, S\u0100LKHI\u0100, S\u0100NKRAIL, ULUB\u0100RIA, and AMT\u0100.\n\nBesides the two great railways mentioned above, the Howrah-Sheakh\u0101la and Howrah-Amt\u0101 Light Railways have opened out tracts in the north and north-west which were formerly difficult of access. An extension of the Amt\u0101 line from Jagatballabhpur to Champ\u0101d\u0101nga has been sanctioned. The grand trunk road leading north from Sibpur, and the Orissa trunk road, which in this District runs from Ulub\u0101ria to the R\u016bpn\u0101r\u0101yan river, are maintained from Provincial funds, their aggregate length in the District being 25 miles. Exclusive of these and of the roads within Howrah and Bally municipalities, the District contains 117 miles of road, of which 35 are metalled, and 441 miles of village tracks.\n\nBefore the opening of the Cuttack branch of the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway, the MIDNAPORE CANAL formed the main route between Calcutta and Midnapore. The first two reaches of this canal, running westwards from Ulub\u0101ria on the Hooghly to the D\u0101modar and thence to the R\u016bpn\u0101r\u0101yan, lie within the District. The two latter rivers\nare also connected by the Gaigh\u0101ta Bakshi Kh\u0101l, an improved natural waterway. Other navigable channels are the Bally Kh\u0101l, which runs from the D\u0101nkuni marsh into the Hooghly at Bally and forms the main outfall of the D\u0101nkuni drainage, and the S\u0101nkrail, K\u0101ls\u0101pa, Mith\u0101kunda, and Pukuria Kh\u0101ls. Inland navigation is carried on in small country boats; and daily steamer services connect Calcutta with R\u0101jganj, Ulub\u0101ria, Gh\u0101t\u0101l (via Ulub\u0101ria), and K\u0101lna (via Bally and Uttarp\u0101ra), all of which serve places within the District.\n\nIt has already been mentioned that Howrah, when made a separate magisterial charge, continued for revenue purposes to form part of Hooghly. Land revenue and cesses are still paid there; but the Magistrate of Howrah has been appointed a Deputy-Collector and declared independent of Hooghly with regard to excise, land acquisition, salt, income-tax, treasury, and stamps. He is assisted by a staff of one Joint-Magistrate and three or four Deputy-Magistrate-Collectors, while another Deputy-Collector, assisted by a Sub-Deputy, is in charge of the Ulub\u0101ria subdivision. Howrah city is the head-quarters of an Assistant Inspector-General of railway police.\n\nThe administration of civil justice is controlled by the District Judge of Hooghly. The District shares with Hooghly a Small Cause Court Judge, assisted by a Registrar, for the disposal of petty money claims, and there are five Munsifs, of whom three are stationed in Howrah city, and one each at Amt\u0101 and Ulub\u0101ria. Sessions cases are tried by the Additional Judge of the Twenty-four Parganas. Howrah, with its large labour force and fluctuating population, is a convenient centre for criminals; and it is largely frequented by professional thieves from up-country.\n\nThe approximate rent paid by the actual cultivator to his immediate landlord is Rs. 13 per acre for rice lands, Rs. 26 for sugar-cane fields, Rs. 22 for jute lands, and Rs. 16 for autumn rice lands. The land revenue and cess accounts are included in those of Hooghly District, and it is only in recent years that those for revenue from other sources were made separate. The latter amounted to Rs. 4,06,000 in 1901\u20132 and to Rs. 4,62,000 in 1903\u20134.\n\nOutside the municipal towns of Howrah, Bally, and Ulub\u0101ria, local affairs are managed by a District board, with subordinate local boards at Howrah and Ulub\u0101ria. In 1903\u20134 the income of the District board was Rs. 1,13,000, of which Rs. 39,000 was derived from rates; and the expenditure was Rs. 1,04,000, half of which was spent on public works. The Howrah District board was the pioneer in introducing light railways in Bengal; the railways from Howrah to Amt\u0101 and to Sheakh\u0101la were constructed under a guarantee of 4 per cent.\ninterest on the capital, the board receiving half of any profits earned in excess of this amount. The board has profited handsomely by the former railway.\n\nThe embankments along the D\u0101modar and on the south bank of the Gaigh\u0101ta Bakshi Kh\u0101l have a total length of 37 miles, and there are 6 miles of tak\u0101vi embankment on the left bank of the M\u0101d\u0101ria Kh\u0101l. Large areas have been drained by the R\u0101japur, Howrah, and Barajal\u0101 drainage schemes, the works consisting of drainage channels with sluices leading into the Hooghly. These serve also as a protection against drought, as they afford a means of irrigation in years of deficient rainfall. The Hooghly is spanned by a pontoon bridge, which is described in the article on Calcutta, and the D\u0101modar and R\u016bp-n\u0101r\u0101yan have been bridged near their mouths by the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway. At Sibpur are situated the Botanical Gardens, which are beautifully laid out along the Hooghly and are stocked with both ornamental and useful plants. They were founded in 1788, at the instance of Colonel Alexander Kyd, for the collection of plants indigenous to the country, and for the introduction and acclimatization of foreign species. This object has been fully realized, and the gardens are a centre of botanic science for all India. They cover 272 acres and contain a fine herbarium, a botanical library, and monuments to the first two Superintendents, Kyd and Roxburgh.\n\nThe District contains 18 police stations and 14 outposts. The police force subordinate to the District Superintendent in 1903 (including extra police) consisted of 5 inspectors, 25 sub-inspectors, 47 head constables, and 688 constables; there was also a rural police force of 132 daffad\u0101rs and 1,374 chaukid\u0101rs. There was one policeman to every 0.8 square mile of area and to every 1,431 persons. Subsidiary jails at Howrah city and Ulub\u0101ria have an aggregate accommodation for 61 prisoners.\n\nIn 1901 the proportion of literate persons was 11.5 per cent. (21.2 males and 1.2 females), the proportion for males being exceeded in Bengal only in the case of Calcutta. The total number of pupils under instruction was 33,200 in 1892-3 and 33,464 in 1900-1. In 1903-4, 39,301 boys and 2,331 girls were at school, being respectively 59.6 and 3.7 per cent. of the children of school-going age. The number of educational institutions, public and private, in 1903 was 940, including 58 secondary, 829 primary, and 53 special schools. The expenditure on education was 3.62 lakhs, of which 1.48 lakhs was contributed by Government, Rs. 24,000 by the District board, and Rs. 6,000 by municipalities, while 1.58 lakhs was derived from fees. The principal educational institution is the Civil Engineering College at Sibpur.\n\nIn 1903, excluding the General Hospital in Howrah city, the District\ncontained 5 dispensaries, of which 2 had accommodation for 9 in-patients; the cases of 25,000 out-patients and 169 in-patients were treated, and 1,583 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 9,000, of which Rs. 200 was met from Government contributions, Rs. 3,000 from Local and Rs. 1,300 from municipal funds, and Rs. 4,000 from subscriptions.\n\nVaccination is compulsory only within the municipal areas. Elsewhere vaccination is backward, and the number of successful vaccinations in 1903\u20134 was only 21,500, or 25 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n[Sir W. W. Hunter, Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. iii (1876) and C. N. Banerjee, Account of Howrah, Past and Present (Calcutta, 1872).]\n\nHowrah Subdivision.\u2014Head-quarters subdivision of Howrah District, Bengal, lying between $22^\\circ 30'$ and $22^\\circ 42'$ N. and $88^\\circ 2'$ and $88^\\circ 22'$ E., with an area of 173 square miles. The subdivision is a level plain, bounded on the east by the Hooghly river, and containing numerous swampy depressions farther inland. The population in 1901 was 431,257, compared with 366,296 in 1891, the density being 2,493 persons per square mile. It contains two towns, Howrah (population, 157,594), the head-quarters, and Bally (18,662); and 365 villages.\n\nHowrah City.\u2014Head-quarters of Howrah District, Bengal, situated in $22^\\circ 35'$ N. and $88^\\circ 21'$ E., on the right bank of the Hooghly, opposite Calcutta. The city, which stretches for 7 miles along the banks of the river and includes the important suburbs of Sibpur, Ghusuri, Salkhia, and Ramkrishnapur, is now a great industrial suburb of Calcutta, of comparatively modern growth. In the sixteenth century a market sprang up at Betor, near Sibpur, where the Portuguese used to tranship their goods from their sea-going vessels into the small river craft which ascended the Hooghly to Satgaon. Towards the end of the century Betor was deserted in favour of Sutanuti, the site of the modern Calcutta. In 1785 Howrah was a small village held by one Mr. Lovett, who found it so unprofitable that he petitioned to be allowed to relinquish it. The Nawab Nazim's artillery park was at one time stationed here; and the artillery practising ground is shown in old maps, north of the railway, where the most densely populated part of the city now is. The Government salt golas were located within the limits of the town, and it gradually grew in importance until in 1843 it became the seat of a separate Magistracy. In 1853 a further impetus was given to its development by the establishment here of the terminus of the East Indian Railway, the first section of which was opened to traffic in 1854. In 1874 the pontoon bridge was opened, and the improved communication with Calcutta thus afforded enabled many of the people employed in the metropolis to reside on the right\nbank of the Hooghly. Meantime, there had been a continuous development of various large industries conducted according to European methods, of which the rope-works at Ghusur\u012b and Shalim\u0101r, founded a century ago, are probably the oldest. Then followed iron foundries and engineering works, and subsequently the rise of the jute and cotton-spinning industries, until at the present time there are no less than forty registered factories working within municipal limits.\n\nExcluding 13,715 persons in Bally, which then belonged to Howrah but has since been made a separate municipality, the population in 1872 was 84,069. In 1881 it had grown to 90,813, and in 1891 to 116,606, while at the Census of 1901 it was 157,594, or 35 per cent. more than in 1891 and nearly 87 per cent. more than in 1872. This rapid expansion is due almost entirely to the great industrial development that has taken place. The growing demand for labour has been met by immigration, about two-thirds of the inhabitants being immigrants, chiefly from up-country. More than 33,000 come from the United Provinces, and about 25,000 from Bihar. Among these foreigners there is an enormous excess of males, who outnumber the females in the ratio of 2 to 1. They are for the most part operatives in the mills, who return home as soon as they can afford to do so. In the meantime, they live huddled together in crowded lodging-houses. This overcrowding is not a necessary condition in Howrah, as there is ample room for building at no great distance from the centres of industry. It proceeds partly from the desire of the operatives to live as near as possible to their work, partly from their poverty which leaves them little to spare for rent, and partly from the pressure of municipal taxation which falls heaviest on huts and discourages the construction of new ones, unless there is a certainty of their being kept full of lodgers. With the exception of Calcutta, Howrah is now the most populous city in Bengal. Of the total population, 73\u00b76 per cent. are Hindus and 24\u00b79 per cent. Muhammadans, while there are 2,282 Christians and 71 followers of other religions.\n\nHowrah was constituted a municipality in 1862. The income during the ten years ending 1901-2 averaged 5\u00b786 lakhs, and the expenditure 5\u00b740 lakhs. The rapid growth of the population has led to a great increase in the value of house property and land, and the income has more than doubled during the decade, amounting in 1903-4 to 9\u00b771 lakhs, of which 1\u00b783 lakhs was derived from a tax on houses and property, 1\u00b749 lakhs from a conservancy rate, 1\u00b733 lakhs from a water rate, Rs. 55,000 from a lighting rate, Rs. 12,000 from a tax on vehicles, and Rs. 52,000 as rent from lands and other municipal property. The incidence of taxation was Rs. 3-6-6 per head of the population. In the same year the expenditure was 6\u00b710 lakhs, including Rs. 60,000 spent on lighting, Rs. 97,000 on water-supply, Rs. 18,000 on drainage.\nRs. 1,79,000 on conservancy, Rs. 55,000 on roads, Rs. 17,000 on medical relief, and Rs. 5,000 on education. Portions of the city have been lit with gas for more than 25 years, and the system is being extended; but the greatest recent improvement was the introduction in 1896 of a filtered water-supply from water-works, filters and pumping stations having been constructed at Serampore. The city had previously suffered very severely from water famines and cholera; but since the opening of the water-works the former have ceased, and the latter has not appeared in epidemic form. On the other hand, the general death-rate has risen. The city lies low, and the amount of stagnant water has greatly increased since the water-works were opened. It is in urgent need of an efficient system of drainage. The municipality maintains 50 miles of metalled and 4 miles of unmetalled roads.\n\nHowrah is the terminus of the East Indian and the Bengal-Nagpur Railways, which bring down the coal and other products of the western Districts and connect Calcutta with the general railway system of Upper India and the Peninsula. It is also the terminus of the Howrah-Amta and Howrah-Sheakhala Light Railways. It is connected with Calcutta by a floating pontoon bridge (see Calcutta). The chief public buildings are the Magistrate's office, the civil courts, the District board and municipal offices, the Howrah General Hospital, the Sibpur Civil Engineering College, and the Howrah District school. The jail has accommodation for 18 convicted and 31 under-trial prisoners.\n\nFor police purposes the town is divided into 3 thanas, Howrah, Golabari, and Sibpur; and the force in 1904 consisted of 3 inspectors, 5 sub-inspectors, 18 head constables, and 345 constables.\n\nThe principal educational institution is the Civil Engineering College at Sibpur, which occupies the buildings and premises of the old Bishop's College, since transferred to Calcutta. The college contains four departments. In the Engineer department, the course extends over four years, after which the pupils have to undergo a further period of one year's practical training under the Public Works department to obtain the final college certificate; a certain number of the successful graduates receive appointments in Government service. The course in the Apprentice department lasts for five years, but those leaving after three and a half years are entitled to third-grade overseer's certificates. The Artisan class is chiefly for the benefit of sons of mistris (carpenters), and a stipend of from R. 1 to Rs. 3 a month is given to those who turn out satisfactory work. The Agricultural class is to be transferred to the Imperial Institution at Pusa. The total number of pupils under instruction in 1903-4 was 386, and the expenditure amounted to Rs. 1,50,000, of which Rs. 1,28,000 was met from Provincial funds and the balance from fees.\nThe Howrah General Hospital has 112 beds, and in 1903 1,848 in-patients and 13,000 out-patients were treated, and 1,521 operations were performed. The expenditure amounted to Rs. 34,000, of which Rs. 6,000 was contributed by Government, Rs. 10,000 from Local funds, Rs. 5,000 from municipal funds, and Rs. 9,000 from subscriptions.\n\n**Hsahtung (Burmese, Thaton).**\u2014State in the central division of the Southern Shan States, Burma, lying between 19\u00b0 54' and 20\u00b0 24' N. and 97\u00b0 7' and 97\u00b0 29' E., with an area (including the dependencies of Tamhpak or Tabet, and Lakhong or Lamaing) of 472 square miles. On the north it is bounded by Wanyin, Mongpawn, and Mongsit; on the east by Mawkmai, from which it is separated by the Nam Pawn; on the south by Karenni; and on the west by Mongpai, Sakoi, Nantok, and Samka. Over the centre and eastern half of the main State extends a plateau, about 4,000 feet above the sea, formed of thinly wooded rolling downs. This is the prosperous Taungthu tract. The two dependencies are in the south, are low-lying, and are mainly populated by Shans. In the south is a small forest area, which was worked till recently. The forest revenue in 1904 amounted to Rs. 1,248. A certain amount of flat rice land is irrigated from the Tamhpak stream by means of water-wheels; but most of the rice is grown on the hill-slopes to the east on the taungras worked by the Taungthus, who also cultivate numerous homestead gardens. Less important crops are cotton and tobacco. The population in 1901 was 10,584, distributed in 159 villages. Of this total, classified according to the language spoken, 7,616 were Taungthus, 2,126 Shans, and the remainder Padaungs and Karens. Nearly all the inhabitants are Buddhists. Hsahtung may be looked upon as the head-quarters of the Taungthu race in the Shan States. The Myoza, who is a Taungthu, has his residence at Loiput (population, 211), in the north of the State, connected by a country track with the main Southern Shan States cart-road. The revenue in 1903 amounted to Rs. 15,500 (nearly all from thathameda); and the chief items of expenditure were Rs. 6,000 tribute to the British Government, Rs. 4,700 spent on pay and administration, Rs. 3,600 credited to the privy purse, and Rs. 1,200 spent on public works.\n\n**Hsamonghkam (Burmese, Thamakan or Thamainghan).**\u2014One of the largest States in the Myelat division of the Southern Shan States, Burma, lying between 20\u00b0 26' and 20\u00b0 50' N. and 96\u00b0 27' and 96\u00b0 47' E., with an area of 297 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Kyong and Poila; on the east by Mawnang and a circle of Yawngwe; on the south by part of Yawngwe and by Loimaw and Loi-ai; and on the west by the Yamethin and Meiktila Districts of Upper Burma. About 7,500 acres are under cultivation. Rice is the chief crop, grown mainly in\ntaungyas; thanatpet is an important product, and the cultivation and export of potatoes is on the increase. The population of the State in 1901 was 12,561, distributed in 196 villages. About 6,000 of the total were Danus (of mixed Burmese and Shan origin), 4,500 Taungthus, and the remainder Shans and members of other hill tribes. The residence of the Myoza is at Hs\u00e0monghkam (population, 531), in the centre of the State, near the main road from Thazi to Taunggyi. It is the head-quarters of the Assistant Superintendent in charge of the Myelat division. The revenue in 1904-5 was Rs. 16,000 (mainly from thathameda, but also including land revenue). The tribute to the British Government is Rs. 8,300.\n\nHsawnghsup (Burmese, Thaungdut).\u2014Shan State within the limits of the Upper Chindwin District, Upper Burma, over which the Deputy-Commissioner of that District exercises a certain control. It lies almost wholly to the west of the Irrawaddy, between 24\u00b0 5' and 24\u00b0 56' N. and 94\u00b0 22' and 94\u00b0 43' E. On the north it is bounded by the Homalin township; on the west by Manipur; and on the east and south by the townships of Paungbyin and Tamu. The main hill system of the Upper Chindwin District commences in the extreme north of the State, and covers the greater portion of it; between this range and Manipur is the upper end of the Kabaw valley, in which the old capital of Thaungdut is situated. A few hamlets lie in this valley, but otherwise the population of the State is confined almost entirely to the villages on the Chindwin, one of which is the capital, Thaungdut (population, 868). The rest of the country is dense forest. Previous to annexation Hsawnghsup had been a vassal State of Burma, and the Sawbwa ruling in 1886 was friendly to the British, and remained loyal throughout the Wuntho rebellion, although related to the Wuntho Sawbwa. The area of the State is about 579 square miles, and the population (estimated at 6,200 in 1897) was found to be 7,471 in 1901. Of this total, 57 per cent. are Shans, 35 per cent. Burmans, and the remainder Chins, the whole being distributed in 84 villages. Under the Sawbwa are myo-oks in charge of townships, who are responsible for the revenue, civil, and criminal administration of their charges. Regular taxes were first imposed in 1890, and under the present Sawbwa thathameda is levied at Rs. 10 per household. There are no other taxes. The revenue amounts to about Rs. 8,000, Rs. 400 being payable as tribute to the British Government. Order is kept by a force of about 30 police, armed with guns and das. There is a small export of paddy.\n\nHsenwi, North (Burmese, Theinni).\u2014A Northern Shan State, Burma, lying between 22\u00b0 37' and 24\u00b0 9' N. and 97\u00b0 14' and 98\u00b0 55' E., with an area of 6,330 square miles. It lies, for the most part, west of the Salween, and is bounded on the north and east by China; on the south by the Wa States east of the Salween and by South Hsenwi west\nof it; and on the west by the Hsipaw, Tawngpeng, and M\u00f6nghit States and Bhamo District. The greater part of the northern section is a mass of hills inhabited by Kachins; Palaung villages are numerous in places, and a good many Chinese settlements are scattered about. Even here, however, a number of valleys under rice cultivation remain in the hands of the Shans. The trans-Salween portion of this northern area forms the rugged district of Kokang, where most of the inhabitants are Chinese. The southern half of the State is at a much lower level, and has more flat land, along the valleys of the Nam Tu and its tributaries. This is the most valuable part of the State, and is inhabited almost entirely by Shans, with isolated circles of Kachins and other hill tribes. The valley of the Shweli along the northern border is fertile, and peopled by Shans.\n\nNorth and South Hsenwi did not exist as separate States before 1888. The old State of Hsenwi included, besides North and South Hsenwi, the present Southern Shan States of Kehsi Mansam, M\u00f6nghsu, M\u00f6nhsang, Kengl\u00f4n, and M\u00f6nghnawng, and exercised a suzerainty over Mangl\u00f4n and its dependencies across the Salween. The principality disintegrated, however, in later Burmese times into five divisions, each under an independent ruler or more than one; and in king Thibaw's time it had fallen into a hopeless state of disorder, in consequence of the rebellion of Sang Hai, a subordinate official, whose relations had been murdered by the Sawbwa Hseng Naw Hpa in 1855. At the time of the annexation of Upper Burma, Hsenwi was divided into three camps. The northern portion of the State was in the hands of Hkun Sang Ton Hung, one of Sang Hai's followers and his successor. In the southern portion a man named Sang Aw, commonly known as the Pa-ok-chok, had obtained the upper hand. The titular Sawbwa, Naw Hpa, was at this time in shelter at M\u00f6nhsi in the north. He, however, had his supporters: and on the fall of Mandalay, his son, Naw M\u00f6ngh, arrived on the scene and occupied Lashio. Intestine hostilities followed during 1887; but in 1888 a British column arrived at Hsenwi, and a conference at M\u00f6ngyai resulted in the division of the State into North and South Hsenwi, the former being allotted to Hkun Sang Ton Hung and the latter to Naw M\u00f6ngh. The Pa-ok-chok died in the following year, and a rebellion, headed by members of his family, was promptly suppressed by British intervention. In 1892\u20133 the Kachins rose against the Sawbwa of North Hsenwi, and the tracts inhabited by them are now directly administered by a British officer. Since then there have been no serious disturbances. The population of the State in 1901 (excluding Kokang, which, like the rest of the trans-Salween country, was omitted from the census operations) was 118,325, Shans numbering about 72,000, Kachins 29,000, Palaungs 10,000, and Chinese 5,000. The number of villages (excluding the 'estimated' tract) was 939. The Kachin hill tracts are under a civil officer at Kutkai, north\nof Lashio, who is also adviser to the Sawbwa in his administration of the rest of the State. The capital is Hsenwi (population, 1,305), north of Lashio, on the Nam Tu river, in the centre of the State. Lashio itself is in the State, and other places of importance are: Namhkam (population, about 2,000), a trade centre in the north-west close to the borders of Mongmit, Bhamo, and China; and Mongsi and Tawnio, farther to the east. The revenue of the State in 1903-4 was Rs. 91,000, mainly from thatahameda. The tribute payable to the British Government until 1907 has been fixed at Rs. 10,000; the other items of expenditure in 1903-4 were Rs. 30,000 spent on public works, Rs. 25,000 on administration and salaries, and Rs. 22,000 devoted to the privy purse.\n\n**Hsenwi, South** (Burmese, *Theinnti*).\u2014A Northern Shan State Burma, lying between 22\u00b0 4' and 23\u00b0 1' N. and 97\u00b0 43' and 98\u00b0 39' E., with an area of 2,400 square miles. It is bounded on the north by North Hsenwi; on the south by Manglon and the Southern Shan State of Kehsi Mansam; on the east by the Salween, the Wa States, and West Manglon; and on the west by Hsipaw and North Hsenwi. The State is practically bisected by the huge upland mass of Loi Leng and the spurs extending south from it. Apart from this, it consists of broken hilly country or open rolling downs, the latter chiefly in the east of the State. It is watered by numerous streams, the most important being the Nam Pang, a tributary of the Salween. The cultivation consists of taungyas and level rice-fields in about equal proportions. Besides rice, cotton, sugar-cane, and a little poppy are grown on the hill-slopes; and there are gardens in each village. The history of the State has been narrated in the article on HSENWI, NORTH. The population in 1901 was 67,836, distributed in 961 villages. The predominant race is the Shan, numbering 60,169. In the more hilly tracts are Kachins and Palaungs, numbering 2,320 and 2,568 respectively; and a number of Chinese villages contain altogether 1,406 inhabitants. The rest of the population consists of Burmans, Lisaws, and Was. On a tributary of the Nam Pang, in the east of the State, is Tangyan, the head-quarters of the Assistant Superintendent in charge of South Hsenwi and Manglon. The capital is Mongyi (population, 579), situated in a fertile plain in the south-west. The revenue in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 71,000 (entirely thatahameda). Of this sum Rs. 20,000 was paid as tribute to the British Government, Rs. 19,000 went towards administration and salaries, Rs. 18,000 to the privy purse, and Rs. 14,000 towards public works.\n\n**Hsipaw** (Burmese, *Thibaw*).\u2014One of the Northern Shan States, Burma, lying between 21\u00b0 56' and 22\u00b0 56' N. and 96\u00b0 13' and 98\u00b0 0' E., with an area of 5,086 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the Ruby Mines District and the States of Mongmit and Tawngpeng; on\nthe east by North and South Hsenwi; on the south by the Southern Shan States; and on the west by Mandalay District, from which it is separated for some distance by the Nam Pai river. It is divided into four sub-States: Hsipaw proper in the centre and north-east, Hsumhsai in the south-west, Monglong in the north-west, and Mongtung in the south-east. The main State lies on the geological fault which runs east and west from the Salween at Kunlong to near the rim of the Shan table-land at the Gokteik gorge, and the face of the country is here broken up into a mass of not very well defined ridges and spurs. The chief plain land is in the valley of the Nam Tu near Hsipaw, and the Pyawnggawng-Nawngpeng strath south-west of the capital of the State. The other valleys are insignificant. The country is drained by the Nam Tu, which, on the southern border of the State, runs in a deep gorge about 2,000 feet below the general level of the country. One of the chief natural features of the State is the Gokteik gorge, down which flows a small tributary of the Nam Tu. Taungya rice is grown on the hills and 'wet' rice in the valleys. Other crops cultivated are sesamum, the thanat tree (the leaf of which is used for cigar-wrappers), cotton, ginger, and, in what is known as the Kodaung tract in the west and north-west, tea. The present Sawbwa of Hsipaw is the grandson of Sao Kya Tun, who was appointed Sawbwa by king Mindon as a reward for his assistance in removing Pagan Min from the Burmese throne. The State submitted to the British after the occupation of Mandalay in 1886. The Sawbwa, Hkun Saing by name, had fled, before the persecutions of king Thibaw, to Siam and Rangoon, where he was imprisoned in 1882 for causing the death of two of his servants. On his release he took refuge for a while in Karenni; and at the time of annexation, having obtained assistance from Sawlapaw, the chief of Karenni, he proceeded to Hsipaw and regained his throne in time to be the first Shan chieftain submitting to the British rule. In recognition of this early submission, he was rewarded with the sub-States of Monglong, Mongtung, and Hsumhsai, which were added to Hsipaw proper. He visited England in 1893, and was succeeded in 1902 by his eldest son, who had been partly educated in England. The population of the State in 1901 was 104,700, distributed in 1,661 villages. By far the greater portion (approximately 90,000) are Shans; Burmans and Danus (mainly in the Hsumhsai sub-State) numbered about 10,000; and in the hilly Kodaung tract are Palaungs (about 3,000). The rest of the population consists practically of Kachins and natives of India. The capital is Hsipaw (population, 3,656), situated 134 miles from Mandalay, in the middle of a hill-girt valley on the banks of the Myitnge river, over which a bridge is in course of construction. Hsipaw is one of the principal towns on the Mandalay-Lashio railway, and is the head-quarters of an Assistant Superinten-\ndent of the Shan States, whose residence, close to the Sawbwa's haw or palace, overlooks the Myitnge river. The revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 3,43,000, towards which thathameda contributed Rs. 1,76,000; opium, liquor, and bazar fees, Rs. 78,000; and land tax, Rs. 58,000. The expenditure in the same year included Rs. 1,45,000 spent on administration and salaries, Rs. 77,000 on public works, Rs. 24,000 contributed to the privy purse, and Rs. 70,000 tribute to the British Government.\n\nHubli Taluka.\u2014Central taluka of Dh\u0101rw\u0101r District, Bombay, lying between 15\u00b0 10' and 15\u00b0 30' N. and 75\u00b0 2' and 75\u00b0 27' E., with an area of 311 square miles. It contains one town, Hubli (population, 60,214), the head-quarters; and 74 villages. The population in 1901 was 124,258, compared with 118,182 in 1891. Hubli is the most thickly populated taluka in the District, with a density of 399 persons per square mile. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was 2.6 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 18,000. The watershed of Southern India runs through the taluka. Two small ranges of hills, Doddagudd and Buradsinghi, break the level of the plain. Between Bhatti and Hebsur lies a small tract which is said not to receive a good rainfall oftener than once in four years, and yet to repay the husbandman. The annual rainfall averages 29 inches.\n\nHubli City (Hubbali or Pubbali = 'old village').\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in Dh\u0101rw\u0101r District, Bombay, situated in 15\u00b0 20' N. and 75\u00b0 9' E., on the Southern Mahratta Railway. Hubli is the eighth city in the Presidency in size. Its population has been: (1872) 37,961, (1881) 36,677, (1891) 52,595, and (1901) 60,214, including the suburbs (301). The population in the last year comprised 39,835 Hindus, 17,516 Muhammadans, 902 Jains, and 1,809 Christians. Hubli was made a municipality in 1855. The income during the decade ending 1901 averaged a little over a lakh. In 1903-4 the income was 1.56 lakhs, chiefly derived from octroi (Rs. 62,000), water rate (Rs. 15,000), and taxes on houses and lands (Rs. 14,500). The expenditure is chiefly devoted to collection charges (Rs. 28,000), public safety (Rs. 4,700), water-supply and drainage (Rs. 14,300), conservancy (Rs. 16,800), education (Rs. 23,800), medical (Rs. 7,200), and public works (Rs. 10,000). Situated on the main lines of communication to Harihar, K\u0101rw\u0101r, and Kumta, Hubli has become the centre of the cotton trade of the Southern Mar\u0101th\u0101 country. Besides raw cotton and silk fabrics, a trade in copper vessels, grain, salt, and other commodities is conducted on a large scale. There are two cotton-mills with 34,000 spindles, employing 1,200 hands, six cotton-ginning and pressing factories, and one workshop. The mills produce annually about 3,000,000 lb. of yarn, valued at 13 lakhs. Hubli contains 37 temples, 27 monasteries, 17 mosques, a Protestant\nChristian church of the German Mission, and a Roman Catholic chapel. The largest and most substantial monastery is the Lingayat Mursavirad.\n\nHubli centres round a plain old stone temple to Bhawanishankar, which contains a lingam, an image of Ganpati, and two or three other smaller gods, and from an old Kanarese inscription seems to belong to the eleventh century. Old Hubli is also locally called R\u0101yar Hubli, that is, 'the Hubli made by the Vijayanagar kings' (1336\u20131565). In 1547 Hubli was described as a place of trade in saltpetre and iron. In 1673 it is mentioned as a place of much wealth and of great trade. At this time Hubli was the seat of an English factory, which, with the rest of the town, was plundered by Annaji Dattu, one of Sivaji's generals. In 1675 it was conquered by Muhammad Saiyid Kh\u0101n T\u0101r\u012bn, a general of Aurangzeb, who conferred upon Sh\u0101h Muhammad Kh\u0101n, son of the general, who had been killed in the attack, the fort and district of Old or R\u0101yar Hubli and the petty division of Devar Hubli. In 1685 Sult\u0101n Muazzam took Hubli and Dh\u0101rw\u0101r. Four years later the sardeshmukhi of the district of R\u0101yar Hubli was conferred upon the Desai of Kitt\u016br, who did not enjoy it long. In 1727 one Bassappa of Old Hubli built the town and fort of New Hubli. During the eighteenth century the T\u0101r\u012bn family suffered from the contests between the Mar\u0101th\u0101s and the rulers of Mysore. New Hubli seems to have fallen to the chief of S\u0101ngli, by whom Old Hubli was held when it was taken by General Munro in 1818. In 1820 New Hubli with some other villages and districts was ceded by the chief of S\u0101ngli in lieu of furnishing an annual contingent. Hubli is a military station in the Poona division of the Western Command. It contains a Subordinate Judge's court, two dispensaries, of which one belongs to the railway company, a municipal middle school, two schools for Europeans and Eurasians, and 22 other schools.\n\nH\u016bgli.\u2014River, District, subdivision, and town in Bengal. See Hooghly.\n\nHugri.\u2014River in Mysore and Madras. See Hagari.\n\nHukeri.\u2014Village in the Chikodi taluka of Belgaum District, Bombay, situated in 16\u00b0 13' N. and 74\u00b0 36' E., 30 miles north-north-east of Belgaum town. Population (1901), 6,265. Hukeri is connected with the high road to Poona and with the large town of Gok\u0101k by metalled roads. It is a mah\u0101lkart's station. On the outside of the village, to the north, are some interesting Muhammadan remains of the sixteenth century, including two domed tombs in the same style as those at Bij\u0101pur. One of the tombs is kept in repair and furnished for the use of the Collector, or as a resthouse for travellers. A few miles to the east is another large tomb of the same architecture. The place is abundantly supplied with good water by means of an underground\npipe connected with a spring to the north-west. This system of water-supply dates from the period of Muhammadan rule. A municipality was established in 1854, but abolished in 1864. The town, which has suffered severely from plague, contains a boys' school with 110 pupils and a girls' school with 46. In 1327 Muhammad bin Tughlak stationed officers here on his conquest of the Carnatic. On the Mughal destruction of Bijapur in 1686 Hukeri was the only part of Belgaum that remained to the Marathas, and it continued to be held by an independent Desai, the ancestor of the present Vantamurikar. In 1763 Madhu Rao Peshwa reduced the Hukeri Desai and handed his district to the Kolhapur chief, who was deprived of it in 1769. In 1791 Captain Moor found Hukeri a poor town.\n\n**Huli.**\u2014Village in the Parasgad taluka of Belgaum District, Bombay, situated in 15\u00b0 48' N. and 75\u00b0 12' E., about 5 miles east of Saundatti. Population (1901), 2,104. The chief object of interest is a handsome but ruined temple of Panchlingdeo, originally a Jain basti. Inside are a Lingayat inscription, a curious Naga figure, and a Ganpati, probably brought from some other temple. Of three inscriptions at Huli, two belong to the reigns of the Western Chalukya kings, Vikramaditya V (1018-42) and Somesvara II (1069-75), and one to the Kalachuri Bijjala (1155-67). On the fall of Vijayanagar after the battle of Talikot (1565), Huli with various other places in Belgaum fell to the Navalgund chief Vitta Gauda. In 1674 Huli fort is said to have been built by Sivaji, and it is one of many recorded to have been held by him at the time of his death. While in pursuit of Dhundia Vagh, General Wellesley gave the garrison of Huli on July 30, 1800, a promise of safety on condition that they committed no aggression. On August 1 they plundered the baggage of a British force as it passed the fort on the march to Saundatti, and on the 22nd Lieutenant-Colonel Capper attacked the fort and carried it by escalade. The village contains a boys' school with 82 pupils.\n\n**Huliyar.**\u2014Town in the Chiknayakanhalli taluk of Tumkur District, Mysore, situated in 13\u00b0 35' N. and 76\u00b0 32' E., 14 miles from Chiknayakanhalli. Population (1901), 1,228. Chalukya inscriptions and other remains indicate that the place may have been of importance in early times. In the sixteenth century it was held by the chiefs of Hagalvadi. It was next included in the Mughal province of Sirra, till subdued by Haidar Ali. The municipality dates from 1880. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 700. In 1903-4 they were Rs. 900 and Rs. 1,200, respectively.\n\n**Humcha.**\u2014Village in the Nagar taluk of Shimoga District, Mysore, situated in 13\u00b0 52' N. and 75\u00b0 12' E., 12 miles east of Nagar town. The original name was Pomburchchha, also called Patti Pomburchchha, which at a later period became Hombucha. It was the capital of\na Jain principality founded in the eighth century by Jinadatta R\u0101ya, who is said to have come from Muttra in Northern India. He was invested with sovereignty by the goddess Padm\u0101vati, whose image he had brought with him. By her direction he touched with it his horse's bit, which was at once converted into a golden bit, and she conferred on him the power thus to transmute iron into gold. A descendant of his acquired the S\u0101ntalige country (the Tirthahalli t\u0101luk), and the rulers thenceforward took the name of S\u0101ntara. Around the village are extensive ruins, including those of large Jain temples. The Humcha math is one of the chief seats of the Jains in Mysore, but is now reduced to a very impoverished state.\n\nHungund T\u0101luka.\u2014South-eastern t\u0101luka of Bij\u0101pur District, Bombay, lying between $15^\\circ 51'$ and $16^\\circ 16'$ N. and $75^\\circ 50'$ and $76^\\circ 20'$ E., with an area of 521 square miles. It contains one town, Ilkal (population, 9,019); and 160 villages, including Am\u012bngarh (7,734) and Hungund (4,775), the head-quarters. The population in 1901 was 83,615, compared with 102,894 in 1891, the decrease being attributable to emigration consequent upon famine. The density, 160 persons per square mile, is however above the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was 1.56 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 12,000. Except in the south-west, the soil is mostly black and very rich. During the hot months the heat is very oppressive, but during the rest of the year the climate is one of the best in the District. Hungund has a good water-supply, chiefly from the Kistna, Malprabha, and several streams. The annual rainfall averages nearly 22 inches.\n\nHungund Village.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luka of the same name in Bij\u0101pur District, Bombay, situated in $16^\\circ 4'$ N. and $76^\\circ 4'$ E., about 29 miles from B\u0101galkot station on the Southern Mahratta Railway. Population (1901), 4,775. Most of the wells in the place are impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen. Hungund contains several interesting temples, and two schools, of which one is for girls, with 253 and 57 pupils respectively.\n\nHuns\u016br T\u0101luk.\u2014Western t\u0101luk of Mysore District, Mysore State, lying between $12^\\circ 8'$ and $12^\\circ 35'$ N. and $75^\\circ 55'$ and $76^\\circ 31'$ E., with an area of 660 square miles. The population in 1901 was 115,928, compared with 113,271 in 1891. The t\u0101luk contains two towns, Huns\u016br (population, 6,673), the head-quarters, and Piriv\u0101patna (3,872); and 412 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,57,000. The Cauvery forms part of the western boundary. The Lakshmantirtha runs through the south and east, and is crossed by several dams, from which channels are taken off. The principal hill is that of Bettadpur (4,389 feet). Westwards are low ranges, from which commences the great forest belt of the south-west of the District. The surface is very undulating. The north, centre, and east are open,\nwith scrub jungle in places, and wild date palms in the hollows. Much of the soil is rich red, with black soil in the north. Two 'dry crops' are raised in the year, especially in the south-west. Superior tobacco is grown near Bettadpur. Grazing is exceptionally good.\n\n**Huns\u016br Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the taluk of the same name in Mysore District, Mysore State, situated in $12^\\circ 18'$ N. and $76^\\circ 18'$ E., on the Lakshmantirtha, 28 miles west of Mysore city. Population (1901), 6,673. It is the seat of the Amrit Mahal cattle-breeding establishment, and till 1864 had a large tannery, blanket manufactory, and timber-yard, maintained by the Madras Commissariat. There are now extensive private coffee-pulping works and saw-mills, under European management. The municipality dates from 1872. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 6,000. In 1903\u20134 they were Rs. 5,400 and Rs. 8,700, respectively.\n\n**Hunza-Nagar.**\u2014Two small chiefships lying to the extreme north-west of Kashmir, on the banks of the Hunza river. Towards the north they extend into the mountainous region which adjoins the junction of the Hindu Kush and Muzt\u0101gh ranges; in the south they border on Gilgit; on the west Hunza is separated from Ashkuman and Y\u0101sin by a range of mountains; while the Muzt\u0101gh range divides Nagar from Baltistan on the east. The inhabitants of both chiefships come from the same stock and speak the same language, but are not usually on good terms with each other. In Hunza the people are Maulais or Ismailis, followers of the Ag\u0101 Kh\u0101n, while in Nagar they are ordinarily Shiahs.\n\nLying between these States and Gilgit are Chaprot and Chalt fort with some attached villages, which were long a source of contention between the rival chiefs. In 1877 the ruler of Nagar, with the assistance of the Kashmir Darb\u0101r, successfully occupied the disputed tract; but in 1886 he was persuaded to withdraw his troops, which were replaced by a garrison from Kashmir. In the same year Ghazan Kh\u0101n, the Tham or chief of Hunza, was murdered by his son Safdar Ali, who succeeded him and professed submission to the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Kashmir. The two chiefs combined in 1888, and ejected the Kashmir troops from Chaprot and Chalt, even threatening Gilgit; but both strongholds were reoccupied by the Kashmir forces after a few months.\n\nA British Agency was re-established at Gilgit in 1889; and the chiefs agreed to respect the control of the Agent, to allow free passage through their territory, and to stop raiding on the V\u0101rkand road and elsewhere, yearly subsidies being granted to them, besides the amount paid by the Kashmir State. These engagements were not respected; and in May, 1891, a combined force from Hunza and Nagar threatened Chalt, but dispersed on the arrival of reinforcements. Later in the\nyear they refused to allow roads to be made to Chalt, extending to their own country, and it became necessary to dispatch troops against them. Nagar and Hunza were occupied, and the Tham of the former place submitted, while Safdar Ali, the Tham of Hunza, fled to Chinese Turkist\u0101n. The subsidies were withdrawn, and a Political officer and military force remained at Hunza till 1897; but in 1892 Muhammad Nazim Khan was installed as Tham in place of his half-brother Safdar Ali, while the Tham of Nagar was reinstated. In 1895 subsidies were again granted by the Government of India and the Kashmir State, and in the same year both chiefs assisted in the relief of Chitr\u0101l. Zafar Zahid Khan, Tham of Nagar, died in 1904 and was succeeded by his son Sikandar Khan.\n\nThe chief of Hunza, who claims Roskam and the Taghdumb\u0101sh P\u0101mir north of the Hindu Kush watershed, is permitted to exchange presents with the Chinese authorities in Kashgar, but these relations are under consideration. Both States are autonomous as regards internal affairs, and acknowledge the suzerainty of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 of Kashmir, to whom they pay a tribute of nominal value. They furnish levies for the defence of the frontier, who receive pay from the Kashmir State, and are armed with Snider carbines, presented by the Government of India.\n\n**Huz\u016br Tahsil (1).**\u2014Head-quarters tahsil of the Rewah State, Central India, lying between 24\u00b0 12' and 24\u00b0 43' N. and 81\u00b0 15' and 81\u00b0 59' E., with an area of 1,201 square miles. The greater part lies in the alluvial plain north of the Kaimur Hills, a small section to the south of that range being in the hilly tract. It is watered by the Son and the Bihar, a tributary of the Tons, which meets the Bichia, another tributary, at the town of Rewah. Population fell from 328,932 in 1891 to 316,139 in 1901. The tahsil supports 263 persons per square mile, and is the most densely populated in the State. There are two towns, Rewah (population, 24,608), the capital, and Govindgarh (5,022); and 975 villages. The soil is for the most part fertile, and cultivation is general. The land revenue is 2.9 lakhs.\n\n**Huz\u016br Tahsil (2).**\u2014Head-quarters tahsil of the R\u0101mpur State, United Provinces, lying between 28\u00b0 30' and 28\u00b0 59' N. and 78\u00b0 55' and 79\u00b0 11' E., with an area of 176 square miles. Population (1901), 178,333. There are 244 villages and one town, R\u0101mpur City (population, 78,758), the State capital and tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 4,85,000, and for cesses Rs. 58,000. The high density of population, 1,013 persons per square mile, is due to the inclusion of the city. This tahsil lies in the centre of the State and is very fertile. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 131 square miles, of which 8 were irrigated, chiefly from canals.\nHyderabad Assigned Districts.\u2014See Berar.\n\nHyderabad State\u00b9.\u2014A Native State better known as the Dominions of His Highness the Nizam, lying between $15^\\circ 10'$ and $20^\\circ 40'$ N. and $74^\\circ 40'$ and $81^\\circ 35'$ E., with an area of 82,698 square miles. It forms a polygonal tract occupying almost the centre of the Deccan plateau. Berar and the Central Provinces touch it on the north, and the Kh\u00e2ndesh District of the Bombay Presidency on the north-west; on the south it is bounded by the Kistna and Tungabhadra rivers, which separate it from the Gunt\u00fbr, Kurnool, and Bellary Districts of Madras; on the west it is bounded by the Ahmadnagar, Sholapur, Bijapur, and Dh\u00e2rw\u00e2r Districts of Bombay; and on the east by the Wardh\u00e2 and God\u00e2vari rivers, and the Kistna District of Madras. The State is equal in area to the Madras Presidency, minus the Coromandel Coast and Coimbatore, or a little more than two and a half times the area of Ireland, or one and two-fifths of the combined areas of England and Wales.\n\nThe country is an extensive plateau, with an average elevation of about 1,250 feet above the level of the sea, but with summits here and there rising to 2,500 and even to 3,500 feet. It is divided into two large and nearly equal divisions, geologically and ethnologically distinct, separated from each other by the rivers M\u00e2njra and God\u00e2vari. The portion to the north and west belongs to the trappean region, that to the south and east being granitic and calcareous. There is a corresponding agreement between the two ethnological elements. The trappean region is inhabited by Mar\u00e2th\u00e2s and Kanarese speakers, and the granitic country by Telugu speakers. The trappean or black cotton soil country is a land of wheat and cotton; while Telug\u00e2na, or the granitic region, is a land of rice and tanks. The difference between these two tracts is very marked. The trap or black cotton soil region is covered with luxuriant vegetation, with cliffs, crags, and undulating hills. The soil resulting from the decomposition of trap is of a dark colour, and very fertile; and, being argillaceous, it retains moisture for a considerable time. In the granitic and calcareous region, on the other hand, the hills are bare of vegetation, but the plains are covered with scattered brushwood of every description; dome-shaped hills and wild fantastic boulders and tors abound in many parts, giving the region a gloomy aspect. The soil derived from the decomposition of the granite is sandy, and does not retain moisture. Consequently the rivers in this region run dry during the hot season,\n\n\u00b9 In 1905 the administrative units of the State, from Divisions to taluks, were completely reconstituted. The text generally refers to their constitution before the rearrangement, but the main changes are explained in the paragraph on Administration and in the individual articles.\nand this gives rise to the necessity of storing water in artificial reservoirs, known as tanks, with which the whole of the Telengana tract is studded. The surface of the country has a general slope from north-west to south-east, the main drainage being in this direction; the country to the extreme north-west corner near Aurangabad has an average altitude of about 2,000 feet above sea-level, falling imperceptibly to near 1,200 feet at Raichur and to between 800 and 900 feet near Kurnool.\n\nThe following are the chief hill and mountain ranges in the State. The Balagh\u00e1t (b\u0101l\u0101 = 'upper,' gh\u0101t = a 'mountain pass') is a range of hills which extends almost east and west from the Biloli taluk in the east of Nander District, through Parbhani, till it reaches Ashti, in Bhir District, with a length in Hyderab\u0101d of 200 miles and an average width of about 4\u00bd miles. A spur of this range branches off through tracts lying between the rivers Sina, Manjra, and Kagn\u0101, extending from Ashti in Bhir District through Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, and terminating in Gulbarga District. A spur of the Balagh\u00e1t runs between the rivers God\u0101v\u0101ri and Manjra, and passing southwards from the west of Biloli in Nander District reaches Kaul\u0101s in Indur District.\n\nThe Sahy\u0101driparvat runs along the north, from Nirmal in Indur District in the east, and passing through the District of Parbhani and the province of Berar reaches Ajanta, and proceeding farther in a westerly direction enters the Bombay District of Kh\u0101ndesh. Its total length within the State is about 250 miles, for about 100 miles of which it is styled the Ajanta Hills.\n\nAnother range, known as the Jalna Hills, starts from the Daulat\u0101b\u0101d fort in Aurangabad District, and proceeds eastward as far as Jalna in the same District, and thence passes into Berar, having a length of 120 miles.\n\nThe Kandikal Gutta, 50 miles in length, extends from Warangal District in a north-westerly direction through the Chinn\u016br taluk of Adil\u0101b\u0101d District. It is also called the Sirnapalli range.\n\nThe principal rivers are the God\u0101v\u0101ri and the Kistna, with their tributaries the Tungabhadra, the Purna, the Pengang\u0101, the Manjra, the Bh\u012bma, and the M\u0101ner. There are, besides these, many other smaller streams, such as the M\u016bsi, the Windi, the Munair, and others.\n\nThe God\u0101v\u0101ri enters the State at Phultamba in Aurangabad District, flows through it and the Districts of Parbhani, Nander, Indur, and Adil\u0101b\u0101d for a distance of 500 miles, and changing its course at the north-east corner of Elgandal District, continues in a south-easterly direction for about 170 miles, forming the eastern boundary of Elgandal and Warangal Districts, until at P\u0101ranthpalli, in the latter District, it enters the God\u0101v\u0101ri District of Madras. It is joined by the\nM\u0101njra, which rises in the P\u0101toda t\u0101luk of Bh\u012br District, after a course of 387 miles through Bh\u012br, Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, B\u012bdar, Medak, N\u0101nder, and Ind\u016br Districts.\n\nThe Kistna crosses the border of the Bij\u0101pur District of Bombay at Echampet in Lingsug\u016br District, and taking a south-easterly course traverses the Districts of Lingsug\u016br, Raich\u016br, Mahb\u016bbnagar, Nalgonda, and Warangal, forming the southern boundary of the last three Districts and consequently of the State. Its tributary, the Bh\u012bma, enters Hyder\u0101b\u0101d at Urch\u0101nd in Gulbarga District from the Shol\u0101pur District of the Bombay Presidency, flows through Gulbarga and Raich\u016br, and falls into the Kistna in the latter District. The Tungabhadra, another tributary of the Kistna, touches Lingsug\u016br District at Madl\u0101pur, and flows in a north-easterly direction until it reaches Raich\u016br District, whence it flows due east until its confluence with the Kistna near Alamp\u016br in the same District. The Tungabhadra separates Lingsug\u016br and Raich\u016br from the Bellary and Kurnool Districts of Madras.\n\nThe Pengang\u0101 rises in the Sahy\u0101driparvat and runs east along the north of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, separating Parbh\u0101ni, N\u0101nder, and Sirpur T\u0101nd\u016br (now Adil\u0101b\u0101d) Districts from the southern parts of Ber\u0101r. In Sirpur T\u0101nd\u016br it flows along the western and northern borders until it falls into the Wardh\u0101 river, north of the R\u0101j\u016bra t\u0101luk.\n\nThis wide expanse of country presents much variety of surface and feature. In some parts it is mountainous, wooded, and picturesque; in others flat or undulating. The champaign lands are of all descriptions, including many rich and fertile plains, much good land not yet brought under cultivation, and numerous tracts too sterile ever to be cultivated at all. Aurang\u0101b\u0101d District, besides its caves at Ajanta and Ellora, presents a variety of scenic aspect not met with elsewhere. The country is undulating in parts, with steppe-like ascents in some places and abrupt crags and cliffs in others.\n\nProperly speaking there are no natural lakes in the State, but some of the artificial sheets of water are large enough to deserve the name. These are reservoirs formed by throwing dams across the valleys of small rivulets and streams, to intercept water during the rains for irrigation purposes, and they number thousands in the Teleng\u0101na tract. The largest and most important is the P\u0101kh\u0101l Lake in the Narsampet t\u0101luk of Warangal District, the dam of which is 2,000 yards long, and holds up the water of the river P\u0101kh\u0101l. Its area is nearly 13 square miles, and its length and breadth are respectively 8,000 and 6,000 yards.\n\nThe geological formations of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State are the recent and ancient alluvia, laterite, Deccan trap, Gondw\u0101na, Kurnool, and Cuddapah, and Archaean. Those most largely developed are the Deccan trap and the Archaean, covering immense areas in the north-western\nand south-eastern portions of the territory respectively. The Gondw\u0101na rocks extend for a distance of 200 miles along those portions of the valleys of the God\u0101v\u0101ri and Pranhit\u0101 which form the north-eastern frontier of the State. Though the main area of the Cuddapah and Kurnool formations lies in the Madras Presidency, south of the Kistna, they are found in the valley of that river along the south-eastern frontier for 150 miles, and again in the valleys of the Kistna, the Bh\u012bma, and their tributaries in the south-west.\n\nThe oldest formation, the Archaean, consists largely of massive granitoid rocks, particularly well developed round Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, which extend eastwards past Khammamett as far as the eastern corner of the State, where the rocks become more varied and schistose, containing mica and hornblendic schists, beds of magnetite, metamorphic limestones, and other rocks. Again, a great series of schistose rocks occurs between the Kistna and Tungabhadra in the south-western Districts, which has been mapped and named as the Dh\u0101rw\u0101r system. This consists of hornblendic, chloritic, and argillaceous schists, epidiorites, and beds of quartz, associated with varying amounts of hematite and magnetite, representing a highly metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic series. Except the groups mentioned above, the Archaean formation has not been studied in sufficient detail to define the character and boundaries of its component petrological types. The long narrow bands forming the Dh\u0101rw\u0101r schist outcrops in the last-mentioned region constitute deeply folded and faulted synclines, embedded within older crystalline schists and gneiss, and injected by later granitoid intrusions. They are intersected by auriferous veins, of great economic importance, leading in the past to considerable mining activity which is now being resumed. Innumerable basic volcanic dikes occur throughout the Archaean area, some of which are epidiorites, probably of the Dh\u0101rw\u0101r period, while others, consisting of augite-dolerite or diabase, with micropegmatitic quartz of a later period of volcanic activity, are connected with the lavas of the Cuddapah group.\n\nThe outcrop of the Cuddapah series north of the Kistna river, consisting of quartzites, slates or shales, and limestones, has been divided into several unconformable groups, upper groups of which principally occur in this State. The Kurnool series, which is unconformable to the Cuddapah, consists of quartzites, limestones, and shales, which are not so altered and indurated as those of the Cuddapah. Both these have long been known as the diamondiferous sandstones of Southern India. The gems occur principally towards the base of the Kurnools. A portion of the Cuddapahs corresponds with the Bij\u0101w\u0101rs of Central India, while the Kurnools are closely related to the Vindhyas. The main area of the Cuddapahs and Kurnools terminates near Jaggayya-pet, north of the Kistna. A considerable outcrop of the Cuddapahs\nfollows the south-western border of the God\u0101vari, its former connexion with the main area being indicated by a series of elongated outliers, the largest of which lies east of Khammanett. The largest continuous spread commences north-east of Khammanett, forms the P\u0101kh\u0101l hills, and extends to within a short distance of the God\u0101vari and M\u0101ner confluence. The beds reappear north of the God\u0101vari, and continue north-west up to the frontier of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, where they disappear beneath the basaltic lavas of the Deccan trap. The Cuddapahs of this area are unconformably overlaid by a vast series of quartzites and conglomerates with a few slaty beds, known as the Sullavai series, which possibly represent the Kurnools. Another outcrop of the Cuddapahs, locally known as the Kal\u0101dgi series, occupies a large area in the Bombay Districts of Belgaum and Dh\u0101rw\u0101r, the eastern extremity of which lies within the Dominions. Farther to the north-east is another belt of the Kurnool strata, intercalated between the Archaean gneiss and the Deccan trap, and locally named after the Bh\u012bma river, which flows through their outcrop.\n\nThe Gondw\u0101na rocks, containing the coal-measures, and occupying an enormous area in the valleys of the God\u0101vari and Pranhit\u0101, are divided into the Chiki\u0101la, Kota-M\u0101leri, Kamptee, Bar\u0101kar, and T\u0101lcher groups. The first two belong to the Upper and the rest to the Lower Gondw\u0101nas. The boundaries of this area are mostly faults, as in most of the Indian coal-fields, which accounts for their straightness and parallelism. The T\u0101lchers consist of fine buff sandstones, often of a greenish tinge, overlying greenish-grey slaty shales and sandstones, beneath which lies the well-known boulder-bed. The glacial origin of this latter formation has been thoroughly confirmed by the remarkable section in the Pengang\u0101 near the village of Irai, not quite a mile above the Wardh\u0101 confluence, where not only do the boulders exhibit glacial striations, but the surface of the underlying Cuddapah limestones is deeply furrowed and grooved by ice-action, as is commonly seen in glacial regions.\n\nThe Bar\u0101kars are not more than 250 feet thick, but they are of great economic importance, owing to the coal-seams which they include. They consist of coal-beds, sandstones, and shales, with a few impure thin carbonaceous layers. The coal-beds are of great thickness, the Singareni thick coal averaging 56 feet.\n\nThe Kamptees rest unconformably on the Bar\u0101kars and contain no coal. They consist of clays, conglomerates, and especially sandstones, many of them highly ferruginous, others calcareous, and a few manganeseiferous. Their principal outcrop lies west of the God\u0101vari, below the confluence of the Pranhit\u0101, extending almost as far as the delta.\n\nThe Lower Gondw\u0101nas are principally upper palaeozoic in age. The Upper Gondw\u0101nas contain mesozoic fossils. Some of the most interest-\ning are those of the Kota-Maleri group, including several species of fishes and reptiles, which occur in limestone beds associated with clays. Abundant red and green clays and clayey sandstones form the most distinctive petrological feature of these beds, which rest unconformably on the Kamptees, occupying vast areas to the west of the God\u0101vari and Pranhit\u0101. The Chiki\u0101la beds, resting on the Kota-M\u0101leri, and consisting of highly ferruginous glassy-looking sandstones and iron bands, are unfossiliferous. Their connexion with the Gondw\u0101nas is doubtful.\n\nThe Deccan trap, consisting of bedded lava-flows of basalt and dolerite, with occasional intercalations of fresh-water deposits, known as intertrappeans, covers the western part of the State, and extends all along its northern frontier.\n\nAncient alluvial gravels and clays, sometimes of considerable thickness, occur at various parts in the valleys of the God\u0101vari, Kistna, Tungabhadra, and some of their tributaries, indicating geographical conditions differing from the present ones. Their vast antiquity is shown by their containing the remains of extinct mammalia of pleistocene or upper pliocene age. The surface of the rocks is often concealed by laterite, which is a peculiar form of rock-weathering special to tropical regions. Rocks rich in iron, like the Deccan trap, are particularly liable to this form of decomposition. In the absence of laterite, the weathering of the Deccan trap produces the well-known fertile black soil, which may be in parts contemporaneous with the trap, while in the large river valleys it must have been formed or reconsolidated within a (geologically speaking) recent period, judging from the palaeolithic or even neolithic stone implements found in it. Recent alluvial flats cover considerable areas of the large river valleys, especially along the God\u0101vari below the Pranhit\u0101 confluence down to the delta.\n\nThe principal mineral products of the Dominions are diamonds, gold, and coal. The first occur in the Kurnool series; the gold in the Dh\u0101rw\u0101r system in Lingsug\u016br; and the coal in the Bar\u0101kar, in the God\u0101vari-Pranhit\u0101-Gondw\u0101na system, which is worked at Singareni. Rich iron ores occur in the Chiki\u0101la sandstones, and in the Dh\u0101rw\u0101r schists. These products will be more fully described in dealing with Minerals.\n\nMuch of the land in the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State is level, and a large portion of it is under cultivation, though there are tracts where arable soil has never been broken or cultivated, or where cultivation has lapsed. But wherever the ground is left uncultivated for a year or two, it becomes covered with a low jungle, consisting chiefly of Cassia auriculata and Zizyphus microphylla. Other level tracts also exist where the ground is quite unfit for cultivation. The forests contain,\namong the larger species, *Tectona grandis*, *Diospyros tomentosa*, *Roswellia serrata*, *Anogeissus latifolia*, *Terminalia tomentosa*, *Dalbergia latifolia*, *Ougeinia dalbergioides*, *Schreiberia swietenioides*, *Pterocarpus Marsupium*, and *Adina cordifolia*, with smaller species like *Briedelia retusa*, *Lagerstroemia parviflora*, *Woodfordia floribunda*, *Zizyphus*, *Morinda*, *Gardenia*, *Butea*, *Acacia*, *Bauhinia*, *Cochlospermum*, *Grewia*, and *Phyllanthus*. When ground once occupied is allowed to go out of cultivation for a short time, a similar forest speedily asserts itself, containing, besides the trees already mentioned, a considerable number of the semi-spontaneous shrubs and trees that are frequently found in the neighbourhood of Indian dwellings, such as *Bombax*, *Erythrina*, *Moringa*, *Cassia Fistula*, *Anona reticulata*, *Melia Azadirachta*, *Crataeva Roxburghii*, *Feronia Elephantum*, *Aegle Marmelos*, and various species of *Acacia* and *Ficus*.\n\nIn the hilly tracts the hills are often covered with forests, not as a rule containing much large timber, the leading constituent species being the same as those that grow in the level tracts and arable lands, but these are stunted and deformed. Throughout the whole State scattered trees of *Acacia arabica* and *Acacia Catechu* and toddy-palms (*Borassus flabellifer* and *Phoenix sylvestris*) are common; the latter two are extensively cultivated on account of their sap and juice, which, when drawn and allowed to ferment, produces an intoxicating beverage largely consumed in the Teling\u0101na tract. The soils of this area are also favourable to the growth of the coco-nut, which cannot be grown even with the greatest care in the Mar\u0101th\u0101 region. Around villages, groves of mango (*Mangifera*), tamarind, *Bombax*, *Ficus bengalensis*, *F. religiosa*, and *F. infectoria*, and similar species exist. The tamarind does not flourish in the Mar\u0101th\u0101 Districts to the same extent as in Teling\u0101na.\n\nA greater variety of wild animals and feathered game is not met with in any other part of India, excepting perhaps the Mysore State. Tigers and leopards are found everywhere, while bison and occasionally elephants are met with in the immense jungle about the P\u0101kh\u0101l Lake. The high lands are resorted to by spotted deer (*Cervus axis*), *nilgai* (*Boselaphus tragocamelus*), *s\u0101mbar* (*Cervus unicolor*), four-horned antelope, hog deer, and \u2018ravine deer\u2019 or gazelle. Wild hog are found in the jungles, and innumerable herds of antelope in the plains. Hyenas, wolves, tiger-cats, bears, porcupine, hare, jackals, &c., are in great abundance. Of the varied species of the feathered tribe in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, may be mentioned the grey and painted partridge, blue rock and green pigeon, sand grouse, quail, snipe, bustard, peafowl, jungle-fowl, wild duck, wild geese, and teal of various descriptions. The florican and flamingo are occasionally seen on the banks of the God\u0101vari and Kistna.\nThe climate is not altogether salubrious, but may be considered as in general good, for it is pleasant and agreeable during the greater part of the year. The country being partially hilly, and free from the arid bare deserts of R\u0101jput\u0101na and other parts of India, the hot winds are not so keenly felt. There are three marked seasons: the rainy season from the beginning of June to the end of September, the cold season from the beginning of October to the end of January, and the hot season from early in February to the end of May.\n\nThe mean temperature of the State is about $81^\\circ$. The following table gives the temperature for the three stations where observations have been taken regularly:\n\n| Station       | Height of Observatory above sea-level in feet | Average temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) for the ten years ending with 1901 in |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|               |                                             | January.

The north-east monsoon brings between 4 and 7 inches of rain. The rainfall in 1901 was 32 inches, but in 1900 the total fall amounted to only 15 inches or less than half the normal. Westerly winds blow generally from the beginning of June to the end of September; during the next five months, from October to February, the wind blows from the east; and in March, April, and May north-easterly winds are frequent. The following table gives the rainfall at three stations:\n\n| Station       | Average rainfall (in inches) for the twenty-five years ending with 1901 in |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|               | Jan.

The Telugu-speaking division of this race constitutes the most numerous section even to the present day. The R\u0101m\u0101vana and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata contain traditions\nof Dakhshinapatha (Deccan), which forms the central portion of the State. The visit of R\u0101ma to Kishkindha, identified with the modern Vijayanagar and Anegundi, is familiar to all students of ancient literature.\n\nIt is uncertain when the invasion of the Deccan by the Aryans occurred, but the dominions of the Buddhist king Asoka (272\u2013231 B.C.) covered the whole of Ber\u0101r and a considerable portion of the north-western and eastern tracts of the State. Among the list of conquered nations in Asoka's inscriptions occurs the name of the Pitenikas, who inhabited the city and country of Paithan, on the upper God\u0101vari in Aurang\u0101b\u0101d District.\n\nThe Andhras were the next kings who ruled the Deccan. They are mentioned in Asoka's inscriptions, but their rise to power dates from about 220 B.C. Gradually extending their sway from the Kistna delta, they soon possessed an empire reaching to N\u0101sik; and towards the close of the first century of the Christian era were contending with the Sakas, Pallavas, and Yavanas of M\u0101lw\u0101, Gujar\u0101t, and K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r. Pulum\u0101yi II, who succeeded about A.D. 38, and married a daughter of Rudrad\u0101man the Western Satrap, is mentioned by Ptolemy. He was defeated by his father-in-law and thus lost the outlying portion of his dominions. About a hundred years later the dynasty came to an end, but little is known of the reasons for its collapse. It is possible that the Pallavas who ruled south of the Kistna then extended their power into Hyder\u0101b\u0101d.\n\nThe next dynasty of importance is that of the Ch\u0101lukyas, who rose to power in Bij\u0101pur District about 550, and founded a kingdom spreading east and west across the Peninsula with their capital at Kaly\u0101ni. Pulikesin II (608\u201342) ruled practically the whole of India south of the Narbad\u0101, and even came into contact with Harshavardhana of Kanauj. Throughout their period of supremacy, however, the Ch\u0101lukyas were at war with the Pallavas, and their fortunes and dominions varied, though they continued to rule a large portion of Southern India to the middle of the eighth century, when they were displaced by the R\u0101shtrak\u016btas of Malkhed in Gulbarga District. About 973, the Ch\u0101lukyan dynasty was restored, and for nearly 200 years maintained its position, in spite of fierce struggles with the Cholas and Hoysalas of Dorasamudra. The Ch\u0101lukya power fell about 1189 to the Hoysalas and Y\u0101davas, the latter of whom established themselves at Deogiri (Daulat\u0101b\u0101d). The Y\u0101davas were the last great Hindu rulers of the Deccan, for the Vijayanagar kingdom, which was founded half a century after the advent of the Muhammadans, never acquired much sway in the Deccan proper.\n\nAl\u0101-ud-d\u012bn Khilji led the first Muhammadan expedition into the Deccan, in 1294, against the Y\u0101dava ruler of Deogiri and coerced him\ninto submission. In 1296 he assassinated his own uncle and seized the throne, and sent an expedition to Daulat\u0101b\u0101d. His first expedition was dispatched in 1303 against the K\u0101katiyas of Warangal, who had been established there since the middle of the twelfth century. This having failed, he sent a second under Malik K\u0101f\u016br in 1309, which resulted in the submission of the R\u0101j\u0101, and a promise to pay tribute. Ulugh Kh\u0101n, who afterwards ruled at Delhi as Muhammad bin Tughlak, conducted a later campaign against Warangal, and finally broke the K\u0101katiya power in 1321, though not without a prolonged struggle. In 1310 Malik K\u0101f\u016br was sent against the Ball\u0101la R\u0101j\u0101 of Dorasamudra (Halebid in Mysore), who was made a prisoner and lost his capital, the spoils consisting of 600 elephants, 96,000 maunds of gold, quantities of jewels and pearls, and 20,000 horses. In 1318 Harp\u0101l, the Deogiri ruler, rebelled, but was taken prisoner and executed, and with his death ended the Y\u0101dava dynasty, after a rule of about 130 years. When Muhammad bin Tughlak ascended the throne of Delhi in 1325, the Muhammadans were masters of the Deccan from north to south, the chief R\u0101j\u0101s of Teling\u0101na acknowledging their sway and paying tribute. He changed the name of Deogiri to Daulat\u0101b\u0101d and made it his capital. A few years later the imperial governors of the Deccan revolted. Their rebellion resulted in the alienation of the Deccan provinces and the establishment of the Bahmani dynasty.\n\nZafar Kh\u0101n, who styled himself, according to some historians, Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn Hasan Sh\u0101h Gang\u016b Bahman\u012b, or, according to a contemporary inscription, Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn Bahman Sh\u0101h, founded this line; and having taken possession of the Deccan provinces, including Bidar and Gulbarga, he made the latter place his capital and commenced to reign in 1347. The Bahmani kingdom extended from Ber\u0101r in the north to the left bank of the Tungabhadra in the south, and from D\u0101bal on the west coast to the Teling\u0101na Districts in the east. Muhammad Sh\u0101h, who succeeded his father Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn in 1358, waged wars with Vijayanagar (1366) and Warangal (1371), and acquired great booty from both. It is said that 500,000 Hindus were slain during his reign. He died in 1375 and was followed by his son, Muj\u0101hid Sh\u0101h, whose uncle, Daud Kh\u0101n, three years later, murdered and succeeded him, but was assassinated in the same year (1378). Muhammad\u00b9, the grandson of Hasan Gang\u016b, was proclaimed king and ruled peacefully to the time of his death in 1397. His son, Ghiy\u0101s-ud-d\u012bn, only reigned two months when he was blinded and deposed by L\u0101lch\u012bn, a discontented slave, who proclaimed the king\u2019s brother, Shams-ud-d\u012bn. Firoz Kh\u0101n and Ahmad Kh\u0101n, the grandsons of\n\n\u00b9 Wrongly styled Mahm\u016bd by Firishta, whose error has been unfortunately followed by many modern historians.\nBahman Sh\u0101h, who had been married to Ghiy\u0101s-ud-d\u012bn\u2019s two sisters, rose against Shams-ud-d\u012bn, and forcing their way into the darb\u0101r, made the king and L\u0101lch\u012bn prisoners. Firoz was proclaimed king in 1397; Shams-ud-d\u012bn was blinded after a reign of five months and L\u0101lch\u012bn was put to death. Firoz marched against the Vijayanagar R\u0101j\u0101, who had invaded the Raich\u016br Do\u0101b in 1398, and defeated him, bringing back much plunder. In 1404 the ruler of Vijayanagar advanced to Mudgal and war broke out between the two kingdoms; the R\u0101j\u0101 was defeated and sued for peace, which was granted on the condition that he gave his daughter in marriage to the king, besides presenting a large sum of money, and pearls and elephants, and ceding the fort of Bank\u0101pur as the marriage portion of the princess. In 1417 the king invested the fortress of P\u0101ngal, and the R\u0101j\u0101s of Vijayanagar and Warangal and other chiefs advanced to its relief at the head of a large force. Although Firoz\u2019s army had been decimated by a pestilence which broke out among his troops, the king gave battle, but suffered a severe defeat. The Musalm\u0101ns were massacred, and Firoz was pursued into his own country, which was laid waste with fire and sword. These misfortunes preyed on his mind and he fell into a lingering disorder, which affected both his spirits and intellect, so that he finally abdicated in 1422 in favour of his brother, Ahmad Sh\u0101h. Ahmad Sh\u0101h marched to the banks of the Tungabhadra and defeated the R\u0101j\u0101 of Vijayanagar: peace was, however, concluded on the latter agreeing to pay arrears of tribute. In 1422 Ahmad Sh\u0101h sacked Warangal and obtained much plunder. He founded the city of Bidar in 1430, and died there in 1435. In 1443 there was again war between the Vijayanagar R\u0101j\u0101 and the Bahmani king Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn II, in which the latter was defeated. Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn was succeeded in 1458 by his son Hum\u0101y\u016bn, \u2018the cruel.\u2019 Soon after his accession, he marched to Nalgonda to quell a rebellion which had broken out in his Teleng\u0101na provinces. Hearing of an insurrection at Bidar, he left his minister to carry on the campaign and returned to Bidar, and after putting to death thousands of innocent persons of both sexes his cruelties ended only with his own death after a reign of three and a half years. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Niz\u0101m Sh\u0101h, who died two years afterwards (1463), when his younger brother, Muhammad Sh\u0101h III, was crowned. The reign of this prince is notorious for the execution of the great minister, Mahm\u016bd G\u0101v\u0101n. The king died in 1482, and was succeeded by his son, Mahm\u016bd Sh\u0101h, who gave himself up to pleasure and dissipation; and the governors of provinces, seeing this state of affairs, acted independently, so that only Teleng\u0101na and adjacent Districts of Bidar remained in the king\u2019s possession.\n\nK\u0101sim Bar\u012bd now became minister, and induced the king to make war against Y\u016bsuf Adil Kh\u0101n, who had taken Bij\u0101pur and declared\nhis independence. The Bahmani forces were defeated and the king returned to Bidar. In 1504 Kasim Barid died, and his son, Amir Barid, becoming minister had the king completely in his power. About this time (1510) Yusuf Adil Khan died, and Amir Barid attempted to reduce Bijapur. After a reign of constant vicissitude and trouble, Mahmud Shah died in 1518. Though he was succeeded by his son, Ahmad Shah, Amir Barid remained all-powerful. Ahmad Shah died after a reign of two years, and his son, Al\u00e2-ud-din, was assassinated by Amir Barid. Two other kings, Wali-ullah Shah and Kalim-ullah Shah, succeeded one another in the course of five years, the latter dying in exile at Ahmadnagar in 1527; and with him ended the great Bahmani dynasty, which had reigned first at Gulbarga and then at Bidar for more than 180 years.\n\nAmir Barid assumed sole charge of the affairs of the kingdom; and after many vicissitudes and constant wars with the rulers of Bijapur and Berar, he died at Daulatabad (1538), and was succeeded by his son, Ali Barid, who was the first to assume the title of Shah. In 1565 he, with the other Deccan kings, marched against the Vijayanagar Raja, and the memorable battle of Talikota was fought, which sealed the fate of the kingdom of Vijayanagar. Ali Barid died in 1582, and was succeeded by three other kings, the last of whom, Ali Barid II, was expelled by a distant relation, Amir, who continued to rule for some time after 1609, but it is not known exactly when and how his reign ended.\n\nKutb-ul-mulk, Sultan Kuli, a Turk of noble family, who was governor of the Golconda province under the Bahmanis, took advantage of the distracted state of the kingdom under Mahmud Shah and declared his independence, establishing the Kutb Shahi dynasty, which reigned here from 1512 to 1687. Sultan Kuli waged wars with the Vijayanagar and Kammamett Rajas, and extended his kingdom in the north to the banks of the Godavari. He defeated the Bijapur forces near Koilkonda, and later on took Medak, Kaulas, and other forts from the Barid Shahi king of Bidar. He was assassinated in 1543 at the age of ninety, while kneeling in prayer in the chief mosque at Golconda, at the instigation of his son Jamshed Kuli, after ruling for sixteen years as viceroy and thirty-one as king. He was succeeded by Jamshed Kuli (1543), Subhan Kuli (1550), and Ibrahim Kuli (1550). The last of these allied himself with the Ahmadnagar king against the ruler of Bijapur, who had sought the alliance of Vijayanagar. In 1564 he proposed the alliance against the Vijayanagar kingdom, which led to the battle of Talikota. He died in 1581, and was succeeded by his son Muhammad Kuli. In 1603 Shah Abbas, the king of Persia, sent an ambassador to Hyderabad with valuable presents. Muhammad Kuli was succeeded in 1612 by his nephew\nand son-in-law Muhammad II, who died in 1626, and was followed by his son Abdullah.\n\nWhen the Mughals invaded the Deccan, the local rulers formed an alliance against them; but after defeating the invaders, they fell out among themselves, thus enabling the imperial troops gradually to subdue the country. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, after rebelling against his father, fled from Burh\u0101npur and was welcomed at Golconda by Abdullah Kuth Sh\u0101h. In 1635 Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, who had then become emperor, sent a farm\u0101n to Golconda which was well received; the khutba was read in the name of the emperor in the chief mosque, and coins were also struck in his name. Mir Jumla, the king's minister, appealed to Aurangzeb for help against his master in 1655, and this afforded a pretext for Aurangzeb to invade the territory. Hyder\u0101b\u0101d was plundered, and Abdullah sued for peace and paid arrears of tribute. He died in 1674, and was succeeded by his nephew Abul Hasan, also called T\u0101na Sh\u0101h. After the fall of Bij\u0101pur in 1686, Aurangzeb turned his attention to Golconda, which was taken in the following year. T\u0101na Sh\u0101h was made prisoner and sent to B\u012bdar, and thence to Daulat\u0101b\u0101d, where he died in 1704, and with him ended the line of the Kutb Sh\u0101hi kings.\n\nThe house of the present Niz\u0101ms was founded by Asaf Jah, a distinguished general of Aurangzeb, of Turkom\u0101n descent. After long service under the Delhi emperor, distinguished alike in war and political sagacity, he was appointed Subahd\u0101r or viceroy of the Deccan in 1713 with the title of Niz\u0101m-ul-mulk, which has since become the hereditary title of the family. The Mughal empire at this period was on the verge of decline, owing to internal dissension and attacks from without. Amid the general confusion, Asaf Jah had little difficulty in asserting his independence against the degenerate and weak occupants of the throne of Delhi, but he had to repel the inroads of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s who were harassing the west of his newly acquired territory. His independence was the cause of much jealousy at Delhi, and the court party secretly instructed Mub\u0101riz Kh\u0101n, the governor of Kh\u0101ndesh, to oppose him by force of arms. A battle was fought at Shakarkhelda (Fathkhelda) in the Buld\u0101na District of Ber\u0101r in 1724, when Mub\u0101riz Kh\u0101n was totally defeated and lost his life. This battle established the independence of Asaf Jah, who annexed Ber\u0101r, and fixed his residence at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. At the time of his death in 1748 he was fairly established as independent sovereign of a kingdom co-extensive with the present State, including the province of Ber\u0101r.\n\nAfter his death, N\u0101sir Jang, his second son, and Muzaffar Jang, his grandson by one of his daughters, strove for the succession. At this time the English and the French were contending for supremacy in the East, and each of the claimants secured the support of one of these\npowers; N\u0101s\u012br Jang's cause was espoused by the English, while Muzaffar Jang was supported by the French. The latter, however, fell a prisoner to his uncle, but, on the assassination of N\u0101s\u012br Jang, Muzaffar Jang was proclaimed the sovereign. Dupleix, the French governor, became the controller of the Niz\u0101m's authority. Muzaffar Jang was killed by some Path\u0101n chiefs, and the French then selected Sal\u0101bat Jang, a brother of N\u0101s\u012br Jang, as ruler. Gh\u0101zi-ud-din, the eldest son of Asaf Jah, who, it was alleged, had relinquished his claim at first, now appeared as a claimant, supported by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, but his sudden death put a stop to further struggles. The English and the French were now contesting power and influence in the Deccan; but the victories of Clive in the Carnatic caused the latter to turn their attention to their own possessions which were threatened, and to leave Sal\u0101bat Jang to shift for himself. Niz\u0101m Ali Kh\u0101n, the fourth son of Asaf Jah, at this juncture obtained the support of the English on the promise of dismissing the French from his service. Sal\u0101bat Jang was dethroned in 1761, and Niz\u0101m Ali Kh\u0101n was proclaimed ruler.\n\nIn 1766 the Northern Circ\u0101rs were ceded to the British, on condition that the Niz\u0101m was to be furnished with a subsidiary force in time of war, and should receive 6 lakhs of rupees annually when no troops were required, the Niz\u0101m on his part promising to assist the British with his troops. This was followed by the treaty of 1768, by which the East India Company and the Naw\u0101b of the Carnatic engaged to assist the Niz\u0101m with troops whenever required by him, on payment. In 1790 war broke out between Tip\u016b Sult\u0101n and the British, and a treaty of offensive and defensive alliance was concluded between the Niz\u0101m, the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, and the British. Tip\u016b, however, concluded peace, and had to relinquish half of his dominions, which was divided among the allies. In 1798 a treaty was concluded between the Niz\u0101m and the British Government, by which a subsidiary force of 6,000 sepoys and a proportionate number of guns was assigned to the Niz\u0101m's service, who on his part agreed to pay a subsidy of 24 lakhs for the support of the force. On the fall of Seringapatam and the death of Tip\u016b Sult\u0101n, the Niz\u0101m participated largely under the Treaty of Mysore (1799) in the division of territory, and his share was increased because of the Peshw\u0101's withdrawal from that treaty.\n\nIn 1800 a fresh treaty was concluded between the Niz\u0101m and the British, by which the subsidiary troops were augmented by two battalions of infantry and one regiment of cavalry, for the payment of which the Niz\u0101m ceded all the territories which had accrued to him under the treaties of 1792 and 1799, known as the Ceded Districts. The Niz\u0101m on his part agreed to employ all this force (except two battalions reserved to guard his person), together with 6,000 foot and 9,000 horse of his own troops, against the enemy in time of war.\nAbout 1803 Niz\u0101m Ali Kh\u0101n's health was in a precarious condition, and Sindhia and Holkar, disappointed by the reinstatement of Baji Rao, the last of the Peshw\u0101s, by the British, prepared to resort to arms. To meet the preparations made by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, the subsidiary force, consisting of 6,000 infantry and two regiments of cavalry, accompanied by 15,000 of the Niz\u0101m's troops, took up a position at Parenda on the western frontier of the Niz\u0101m's Dominions. General Wellesley was ordered to co-operate with this force in aid of the Peshw\u0101, with 8,000 infantry and 1,700 cavalry. But before the arrival of the General at Poona, Holkar had left, and on his way to M\u0101lw\u0101 had plundered some of the Niz\u0101m's villages, and levied a contribution on Aurang\u0101b\u0101d. On hearing of this, Colonel Stevenson advanced towards the Godavari with the whole force under him, and was joined by General Wellesley near Jalna. The next day (September 23) the memorable battle of Assaye was fought by General Wellesley, followed shortly afterwards by the battle of Argaon, which completely crushed the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, and secured the Niz\u0101m's territories.\n\nNiz\u0101m Ali Kh\u0101n died in 1803, and was succeeded by his son, Sikandar Jah. In 1822 a treaty was concluded between the British and the Niz\u0101m, by which the latter was released from the obligation of paying the chauth to which the British had succeeded after the overthrow of the Peshw\u0101 in 1818.\n\nOn the death of Sikandar Jah in 1829, his son N\u0101sir-ud-daula succeeded. In 1839 a Wahh\u0101bi conspiracy was discovered at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, as in other parts of India. An inquiry showed that Mub\u0101riz-ud-daula and others were implicated in organizing the movement against the British Government and the Niz\u0101m. Mub\u0101riz-ud-daula was imprisoned at Golconda, where he subsequently died. R\u0101j\u0101 Chand\u016b L\u0101l, who had succeeded Munir-ul-mulk as minister, resigned in 1843, and Siraj-ul-mulk, the grandson of Mir Alam, succeeded him. In 1847 a serious riot took place between the Shi'ahs and the Sunnis, and about fifty persons lost their lives in the riot. Siraj-ul-mulk, who had been removed in the same year, was reinstated as minister in 1851. As the pay of the Contingent troops had fallen into arrears, a fresh treaty was concluded in 1853, and Districts yielding a gross revenue of 50 lakhs a year were assigned to the British. The Districts thus ceded consisted, besides Ber\u0101r, of Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d (Naldrug) and the Raichur Do\u0101b. By this treaty the British agreed to maintain an auxiliary force of 5,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry, and four field batteries; and it was stipulated that after paying the Contingent and certain other charges and interest on the Company's debt, the surplus was to be made over to the Niz\u0101m. The Niz\u0101m, while retaining the full use of the subsidiary force and Contingent, was released from the unlimited obligation of service in time of war; and the Contingent ceased to be part of the\nNizam's army, and became an auxiliary force kept by the British Government for the Nizam's use. A week after the conclusion of this treaty Sirajul-mulk died and Nawab Salar Jang, his nephew, was appointed minister.\n\nNasir-ud-daula died in May, 1857, and was succeeded by his son, Afzal-ud-daula. This was a critical period for Hyderabad, as the Mutiny which convulsed the whole of India affected this State also. It was feared that, if Hyderabad joined the revolt, the whole of Southern India as well as Bombay would rebel. But though His Highness was urged by some of his reckless advisers to raise the standard of revolt, he listened to the good counsels of his faithful minister, Salar Jang, and cast in his lot with the British with unshaken loyalty. After the storm of the Mutiny had subsided, the British Government, in recognition of the services rendered by the Nizam, modified the treaty of 1853; and by a treaty of 1860 Osmanabad (Naldrug) and the Raichur Doab, yielding a revenue of 21 lakhs, were restored, and a debt of 50 lakhs was cancelled, while certain tracts on the left bank of the Godavari were ceded and the Assigned Districts of Berar, yielding a revenue of 32 lakhs, were taken in trust by the British for the purposes specified in the treaty of 1853. Presents to the value of \u00a310,000 were bestowed upon His Highness, and his minister and other noblemen were also rewarded. Afzal-ud-daula was made a G.C.S.I. in 1861.\n\nThe present Nizam, Mir Mahbub Ali Khan Bahadur, succeeded on his father's death in 1869. Being only three years old, a regency was constituted for the administration of the country, with Sir Salar Jang I as regent and Nawab Shams-ul-Umar as co-regent, the Resident being consulted on all important matters concerning the welfare of the State. On the death of the co-regent in 1877, his half-brother Nawab Vikar-ul-Umar was appointed co-administrator; but he also died in 1881, Sir Salar Jang remaining sole administrator and regent till his death in 1883.\n\nNot being fettered in any way, the great minister pursued his reforms with untiring effort. The four Sadr-ul-Mahams or departmental ministers, who had been appointed in 1868, managed the Judicial, Revenue, Police, and Miscellaneous departments under the guidance of the minister, who, besides instructing them in their work, had direct control over the Military, Mansab, Finance, Treasury, Post, Mint, Currency, and State Railway departments. Transactions with the British Government, His Highness's education, and the management of the Sarf-i-khas domains also received his personal attention. A revenue survey and settlement were taken in hand and completed in the Maratha Districts, civil and criminal courts were established, stamps were introduced, the Postal department was placed on a sound\nbasis, and the Municipal, Public Works, Education, and Medical departments received their due share of attention. Thus almost every department of the British administration was represented in the State, and worked with creditable efficiency under the guiding spirit of the great minister. In particular, the finances of the State, which had become greatly involved, were much improved.\n\nIn 1884 His Highness Mir Mahbub Ali Khan, having attained his majority, was installed by Lord Ripon. Sir Salar Jang II was appointed minister, and was followed in 1888 by Sir Asman Jah. In 1892 a Code, known as the Kanuncha-i-Mubarak ('the auspicious code'), was issued for the guidance of the minister, and this was followed by the establishment of a Council composed of all the ministers of the State. In the following year Sir Vikar-ul-Umar became minister, and several changes were effected in various departments of the administration. Maharaja Sir Kishen Prasad Bahadur, the Peshkar, was appointed minister in 1901, and still holds that office.\n\nIn November, 1902, the Assigned Districts of Berar were leased in perpetuity to the British Government at an annual rental of 25 lakhs, a most important event in the history of the State.\n\nMany objects and places of historical and archaeological interest are found scattered throughout the State. Among the most noteworthy are the caves of Ellora, Ajanta, Aurangabad, and Osmanabad (Dharaseo). Of the numerous forts may be mentioned those at Golconda, Gulbarga, Warangal, Raichur, Mudgal, Parenda, and Naldrug. Besides these, Hindu temples of various descriptions are found in every part of the State, some of them of great antiquity, such as the 'Thousand Pillars' temple at Hanamkonda, and the temples at Tuljapur and Ambajogai.\n\nThe oldest type of architecture is of a religious character, and is represented by the caves already mentioned, which belong to Buddhist, Jain, and Brahmanical styles of architecture. Numbers of other caves are found at places of less importance. The temple at Hanamkonda, the temple and its ruined courtyard in the fort of Warangal, and numerous others, are good specimens of Hindu religious architecture. Among the most remarkable specimens of Musalm\u00e2n architecture may be mentioned the mosque in the old fort of Gulbarga; the Mecca and Jama Masjids, the Char Minar, the Char Kam\u00e2n, the Dar-ush-Shifa (hospital), and the old bridge on the Musi, all in the city of Hyderabad; the tombs of the Kutb Shahi kings near Golconda; those of the Bahmani and Barid Shahi kings near the city of Bidar, and that of Aurangzeb's wife at Aurangabad. Besides these, there are numerous other examples of both Hindu and Musalm\u00e2n architecture, now in ruins, such as the palaces of Golconda, Bidar, Gulbarga, and Daulatabad.\nThe population returned at the Census of 1901 was 11,141,142. The total area is 82,698 square miles, and the average density of population is thus 135 persons per square mile; but excluding the capital it falls to 129. The density ranges from 184 to 141 in the thickly populated Districts of Bidar, Medak, Gulbarga, Nalgonda, Nander, Elgandal, and Raichur; from 139 to 125 in Lingsugur, Osmannabad, Indur, Parbhani, and Atraf-i-balda; and from 117 to 54 in the sparsely populated Aurangabad, Bhir, Mahbubnagar, Warangal, and Sirpur Tandur Districts. Table I (p. 300) shows the distribution of population in 1901.\n\nThe State contains 79 towns and 20,010 villages; and of the total population 1,132,109, or 10 per cent., were enumerated in urban areas. The chief city is Hyderab\u0101d, with a population of 448,466. The State contains four places with a population ranging between 20,000 and 50,000, 16 towns of 10,000 to 20,000, and 58 towns of 5,000 to 10,000. Of villages with a population of 2,000 to 5,000, there are 514; in 1,862 villages the population ranges from 1,000 to 2,000; 4,344 villages have a population between 500 and 1,000, and 13,290 villages have less than 500 inhabitants. Some of the places classed as towns, from the fact of their having 5,000 or more inhabitants, are really overgrown rural villages, while on the other hand many taluk head-quarters, with decided urban characteristics, are reckoned as villages, from the accident of their falling short of that standard.\n\nThe average population of a village is about 500. Garhis or walled villages are found all over the State, testifying to the necessity that existed, up to the beginning of the nineteenth century, of affording security against the depredations of marauders, and the constant fear of civil wars in those troublous times. The houses are usually built of mud with thatched roofs.\n\nThe population of the State, according to the two previous enumerations, had been (1881) 9,845,594 and (1891) 11,537,040. At the Census of 1891 it was found that number had risen in all Districts, with the single exception of Nander, where there was a small decline. The total increase during the decade amounted to 17.18 per cent.; but the six Districts of Lingsugur, Raichur, Gulbarga, Mahbubnagar, Nalgonda, and Warangal showed abnormal increases, ranging from 29 to 26 per cent. The first three Districts had suffered most severely from the famine of 1876-8, and were recovering from their depressed state when the first Census was taken in 1881; while the other three Districts had also been affected by the same cause.\n\nThe Census of 1901 showed a net decrease from the population of 1891 of 3.45 per cent., due to the famines of 1897 and 1900, and to the abnormally high mortality from plague and cholera during the latter half of the decade, notably in the Districts of Bidar, Aurangabad,\nBh\u012br, N\u0101nder, Parbhani, and Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, in which the loss varied from 13 to 20 per cent. Elgandal, Ind\u016br, and Raich\u016br suffered less severely, the decrease ranging from less than one per cent. to about 5 per cent. In the remaining Districts of Atr\u0101f-i-balda, Nalgonda, Warangal, Medak, Mahb\u016bbnagar, Sirpur T\u0101nd\u016br, Gulbarga, and Ling-sug\u016br, population rose by about 10 per cent., including Hyder\u0101b\u0101d city.\n\nThe age statistics show the usual tendency to omit from enumeration females of ages ranging between 6 and 20. As elsewhere in India, girls exceed boys in number up to the age of 5. But after that age there is a fall in the number of females up to the age of 20, when the females again preponderate over the males. After the age of 30 a sudden fall is observed in the number of females, which continues up to the age of 60 and over, when the proportion of females again exceeds that of the males. Apart from the omission above alluded to, there is probably a real deficiency of females between 5 and 20 due to deaths caused by early marriage and childbirth. Another tendency exists, especially among the Hindus, to understate the age of unmarried girls after they have attained the marriageable age. The effects of famine may, however, be clearly traced in the age statistics, imperfect as they are. Thus, the Census of 1901 showed the number of children under the age of 5 to be less than that of children in the age periods 5\u201310 and 10\u201315.\n\nNo reliable vital statistics are available, though the police p\u0101ths are supposed to record births and deaths regularly. The effect of the famine of 1900 on the birth-rate has already been alluded to, and infant mortality must have been very great during the period of stress.\n\nThe most common ailment is fever, which accounts for half the total deaths. Diarrhoea, dysentery, and other bowel complaints, as well as small-pox, are the next commonest causes of death. Cholera and small-pox sometimes carry off many persons. The people do not, as a rule, appreciate the advantages of vaccination, but its value is gradually becoming known.\n\nWhen plague invaded the State, the measures first adopted to stamp out the disease or arrest its progress consisted in evacuating infected houses and villages, and in disinfecting them. Camps were subsequently established at some frontier railway stations, where passengers were inspected and detained, and travellers from infected areas were kept under observation after leaving the camps.\n\nOut of the total population in 1901, males numbered 5,673,629 and females 5,467,513. There were thus 964 females to every 1,000 males. The only Districts in which females exceed males are N\u0101nder and Ind\u016br, with 1,006 and 1,005 females, respectively, to every 1,000 males.\nAs regards civil condition, out of every 16 persons, roughly speaking, 8 are married, 5 unmarried, and 3 widowed. Of the male population, 46, 49, and 5 per cent. are single, married, and widowed respectively; while among females the proportions are 31, 50, and 19 respectively. These figures show that the married males and females are almost numerically equal, the difference being an excess of only 43,223 married males over married females. The unmarried males, however, number half as many again as the unmarried females, while widowed females are about four times as numerous as widowed males.\n\nFrom the evenness of the proportions of married males and females it is obvious that, as a rule, polygamy does not exist, though allowed by the two main religions. On the other hand, the large number of widowed females leads to the conclusion that a strong prejudice exists against widow remarriage, shared by even the inferior castes of Hindus, who in this matter follow the practice of the Br\u0101hmans. Among the agricultural castes, however, widow remarriage is largely practised, being called moht\u016brat or m\u0101rmanu.\n\nDistributing the population of either sex in each main age period by civil condition, it is found that unmarried boys under the age of 10 years form 97 per cent., while among females of the same age the percentage of single girls is 89. In the next age period 10-15, the percentage of unmarried boys and girls is 86 and 40 respectively. Between 15 and 40, however, 71 per cent. of the males and 78 per cent. of the females are married. The following table shows the population according to sex and civil condition:\n\n|                | Persons | Males | Females |\n|----------------|---------|-------|---------|\n| Unmarried      | 4,232,492 | 2,573,236 | 1,659,256 |\n| Married        | 6,038,260 | 3,055,266 | 2,982,994 |\n| Widowed        | 1,259,910 | 242,151  | 1,017,759 |\n| Unspecified    | 6,378     | 2,476   | 3,902   |\n| Total          | 11,537,040 | 5,873,129 | 5,663,911 |\n\nTelugu is spoken by 46 per cent. of the population, followed by Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b, which claims 26 per cent. Next come Kanarese and Urd\u016b or Hindust\u0101n\u012b, spoken by 14 and 10 per cent. respectively, so that these four languages claim between them nearly 97 per cent. of the total population. The M\u0101rw\u0101r\u012b dialect is spoken by 57,777 and Hindi by 28,767 persons, the former being the language of bankers and traders from M\u0101rw\u0101r, and the latter of emigrants from Northern India. The Tamil-speaking population numbers 24,475, who belong mostly to the southern Presidency. Gond\u012b claims 59,669 and Koya 15,895. The Gipsy dialects are spoken by 125,070 persons, the\nLam\u0101n\u012b (Lamb\u0101d\u012b) or Banj\u0101r\u0101 alone claiming 120,594. Of the European languages, English is returned by 7,907 persons.\n\n| Chief vernaculars of the State | Persons |\n|-------------------------------|---------|\n| Urd\u016b                          | 1,108,382 |\n| Mar\u0101th\u012b                       | 3,493,858 |\n| Kanarese                      | 1,451,016 |\n| Telugu                        | 5,031,060 |\n| Other languages               | 362,685 |\n| **Total**                     | **11,537,040** |\n\nThe main groups of castes represented are 21 in number, divided into a large number of sub-castes.\n\nThe K\u0101pus or Kunbis, the great agricultural caste in the State, number 2,953,000 persons, or 26 per cent. of the whole population. Next to the K\u0101pus in numerical strength are the M\u0101las or unclean castes, who number 1,584,000, or 14 per cent. of the total. The main group M\u0101la includes the M\u0101las or Dhers and M\u0101digas of Teling\u0101na, corresponding with the Mah\u0101rs and M\u0101ngs of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 tract; and though they occupy a very low position in the social scale, they play a most important part in the village economy. The other numerically strong castes are the Gollas (Dhangars) or shepherds, 832,400; the Br\u0101hmans, 692,800; the Vaisyas or trading castes, 548,000; the Korwas, 533,600; the S\u0101las (weavers), 424,900; and the Gaundlas or toddy-drawers and liquor-vendors, 284,600. The Lam\u0101nis (Lamb\u0101dis) or Banj\u0101ras, who are grain-carriers, number 172,300. Of the important aboriginal tribes, Gonds number about 55,000 and Bhils 9,600.\n\nThe population comprises people of various religions, but only two, Hinduism and Isl\u0101m, have any appreciable following, comprising 88.6 and 10.4 per cent. respectively of the entire population of the State. The followers of other religions are: Animists (65,315), Christians (22,996), Jains (20,345), Sikhs (4,335), and Pars\u012bs (1,463).\n\nThe Hindus have lost 4.3 per cent. since 1891, and it may be observed that the Hindu population has been steadily decreasing for the last twenty years. In 1881 they formed 90.3 per cent. of the population; in 1891 the percentage was 89.4; while in 1901 it was only 88.6. Unlike the Hindus, the Musalm\u0101ns are steadily increasing in numbers. During the last decade there was an increase of 17,084 persons, or 1.5 per cent. In 1881 Musalm\u0101ns formed only 9.4 per cent. of the total population, while they formed 10.4 per cent. in 1901.\n\nLike the Musalm\u0101ns, the Christians have risen in numbers. During the last decade they increased by 2,567, or 12.6 per cent. The Jains\nlost 7,500 persons, or 27 per cent., in the same period. A large increase was recorded between 1881 and 1891, which may be explained by the fact that some of them were returned as Hindus in the Census of 1881. During the last decade the Sikhs also decreased, while the Parsis showed a marked tendency to increase; their numbers, however, are still small.\n\nThe increase among the Musalmans is partly due to proselytizing and partly to their fecundity; while the rise in the Christian population is chiefly due to the efforts of missionaries, and to a less degree to the influx of Eurasians in the army and the civil service or in the mercantile class. Europeans decreased by 914, numbering 4,347 in 1901, compared with 5,261 in 1891. The number of Eurasians rose from 2,507 in 1891 to 3,292 in 1901, while native Christians increased from 12,661 to 15,357. The following table shows the variation in the population classified by religion:\n\n| Religion | Persons |\n|----------|---------|\n|          | 1891    | 1901    |\n| Hindus   | 10,315,249 | 9,870,839 |\n| Musalmans| 1,138,666  | 1,155,750 |\n| Christians| Native | Others |\n|          | 12,661  | 15,357 |\n|          | 7,768   | 7,639 |\n| Others   | 62,696  | 91,557 |\n| Total    | 11,537,040 | 11,141,142 |\n\nThe first English public school in Hyderab\u0101d was founded by a clergyman of the Church of England about 1834, and was followed shortly after by another school opened by the Roman Catholic missionaries. Since then the latter mission has gradually progressed, with the result that it now has several schools and convents in various parts of the State. In 1901 the Catholic adherents were returned at 11,649. The Church of England supports two schools, and in 1901 had 6,813 followers. Among other missions working in the State may be mentioned the Wesleyans and the Baptists, with 1,468 and 885 adherents respectively. The former mission was established in 1880; and, as opportunity offered, its operations have been extended in the Districts lying principally to the north and north-east of Hyderab\u0101d city, with stations at Aler, Kar\u012bmnagar, Siddipet, Ind\u016br, Medak, and Kandi. The mission carries on medical, educational, and evangelistic work, the principal medical establishments being at Medak, where there is a well-equipped hospital for women and children, with two branch dispensaries. With a few exceptions, all the schools in connexion with this mission are primary. Lace-making is taught at Secunder\u0101b\u0101d, Kar\u012bmnagar, and Siddipet, embroidery at Medak.\nweaving at Siddipet, and cabinet-making at Indur. The mission has 11 schools in various Districts, 6 of which are for boys. The American Baptist Telugu Mission commenced work at Secunderabad in 1875, and since then branches have been opened at Hanamkonda, Mahbubnagar, Nalgonda, Suriapet, Jangaon, and Gadwal. In 1902 a hospital was completed at Hanamkonda. The work of this mission is chiefly among the Telugu population, and none of its schools is of a higher grade than lower secondary.\n\nOf the total population, 5,132,902, or 46 per cent., are supported by agriculture. About 32 per cent. are landholders and tenants, 9 per cent. agricultural labourers, and 5 per cent. growers of special products. These figures exclude those who are partly agriculturists, numbering 250,000. Personal, household, and sanitary services support 655,870 persons, or nearly 5.9 per cent. of the population; and the provision of food, drink, and stimulants supports 536,016 persons, or 4.8 per cent. Commerce provides a living for 427,974 persons, or 3.8 per cent. The preparation of textile fabrics and dress comes next, supporting 301,729 persons, or 2.7 per cent.; while the care of animals maintains 284,304 persons, or 2.5 per cent. Earthwork and general labour provide a livelihood for 1,434,259 persons, or 13 per cent.; and those leading an independent life number 410,394, or 3.7 per cent.\n\nThe staple food of the poorer classes consists chiefly of cakes of jowar and bajra, though in the Telengana Districts rice is also used to a large extent. Along with the cakes are eaten curries made of vegetables and pulses, onions, oil or ghee, seasoned with tamarind or chillies or both. Musalmans and Hindus alike eat goats' flesh. The Musalmans in the country tracts, out of respect to the feelings and prejudices of their Hindu neighbours, do not indulge in beef; but the Musalman inhabitants of towns and large villages have no such scruples. The Malas, including Dhers, Chamars, Mahars, and Mangs, will eat the flesh of cattle which have died a natural death.\n\nThe ordinary form of dress for a villager is a dhoti or waistcloth, a short jacket or coat of cotton, a turban of red or white colour in the Maratha Districts and always white in Telengana, and a kammal or blanket which he almost always carries. The women wear a sari, which is a piece of cloth 5 or 6 yards long and 4 feet broad, one end being fastened round the waist, while the other is carried over the head and shoulders, and covers the rest of the body. In addition to the sari, the women wear a choli or a short bodice. The dress described above is worn by Hindus and Musalmans alike; but Musalman women often wear a lahnga or petticoat, with a choli and dupatta, the last covering the head and the body. Gond and Waddar females discard the choli altogether, but wrap the end of the sari round the upper part of the body.\nThe home of the common cultivator consists of three or four small rooms, the walls being of mud and the roof tiled or thatched, the rooms being built round a *bhavanti* or courtyard. The Dhers and other low castes, and the poorer classes of villagers, live in huts made of reeds and hurdles, plastered over with mud and cow-dung.\n\nHindus of the higher castes, such as Br\u0101hmans, R\u0101jputs, and Bani\u0101s, burn their dead, while the lower castes usually bury them. Among Musalm\u0101ns the dead are always buried.\n\nThere are very few amusements in which the cultivators indulge. In the evenings they gather at the village *chauri* and join in gossip or pass the time with their families, discussing the topics of the seasons and the crops. Occasionally they go to neighbouring markets or visit places of pilgrimages and fairs in the neighbourhood. Sometimes they enjoy the performance of mountebanks or strolling actors, and the recitation of religious poems is very popular.\n\nThe ordinary Hindu festivals are the Holi, the Div\u0101li, the Dasara, the N\u0101gapanchami, the R\u0101mnaumi, the Pitrapaksha, and the Sivar\u0101tri. The Pola festival is celebrated everywhere, when the cattle are garlanded and decorated, and led through the village, accompanied by their owners. The Musalm\u0101n festivals are the Muharram, the Bakr-Id, the Id of Ramz\u0101n (feast after fasting month), the Shab-i-bar\u0101t, the Du\u0101zdahum-i-sharif (anniversary of the Prophet\u2019s death), and the Y\u0101zdahum. The Nau-roz or Persian New Year\u2019s day is also celebrated as a State holiday.\n\nAmong Hindus the joint family system prevails everywhere, but in most cases it is not maintained beyond one generation.\n\nIn the Mar\u0101th\u0101 Districts the name of a person is usually followed by the name of the village to which he originally belonged, as for example D\u0101da Korlekar, which means \u2018D\u0101da of the Korla village.\u2019 But in Teling\u0101na the name of the village precedes the personal name, as M\u0101t\u016br Venka, which means \u2018Venka of M\u0101t\u016br village.\u2019 Mar\u0101th\u0101s and Brahm\u0101ns usually have three names, the first being the person\u2019s own name, the second his father\u2019s, while the third is the name of his family or village.\n\nThe soils of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State may be divided into two main divisions. Those of all the Teling\u0101na Districts may be classed generally under three kinds, black, red, and sandy; and those in the Mar\u0101th\u0101 Districts may be similarly classed in three divisions, black, red, and a mixture of the two. Locally, a number of varieties are distinguished in Teling\u0101na. Thus, *utcha regar* is dark in colour and plastic when wetted, and consists chiefly of alluvium, with a good supply of lime and little silica. *Katta regar* is a stiff loam, containing less lime than *utcha regar* and little soluble matter. *Raura* is a good garden soil, containing 7 per cent.\nof lime in a pulverized state. *Rauti zamin* is also a garden soil, containing only 5 per cent. of lime. *Sola zamin* is greyish in colour, and resembles *rauti zamin*. It is used for the *abi* rice crop, and is manured by herding cattle, goats, and sheep on it. *Chunaka regar* is a rough aluminous soil, containing 12 per cent. of lime, and is best suited for *jowar* and pulse. *Chauka regar* or *milwa* is a mixture of red and black soils, with very little lime. *Chalka* or *reva zamin* is a finely pulverized reddish soil, with sand and traces of lime, and is well suited for rainy season crops. *Yerra chauka* is similar in every respect to *chalka zamin*, but not so finely powdered. The Mar\u0101thw\u0101ra soils are called *regar* (black), *masab* (red), or *milwa* (mixture). The soils of the higher tracts are heavy and rich in alumina, while those found on the plains are light and loamy; but neither is of very great depth. Broadly speaking, they are derived from the disintegration of basalt and amygdaloid wacke, the former giving rise to the stiff black soil, and the latter forming a friable earth. But when the black soil is mixed with the light friable earth, the result is a rich loam, which is more retentive of moisture than the others.\n\nThe climate of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 Districts is generally hot and dry from March to the end of May, and temperate during the remaining months; while that of Teleng\u0101na is hot and damp from March to the end of September, and temperate for the rest of the year. More than three-fourths of the total rainfall, or about 23 inches, is generally received between June and September, the remainder falling between October and November.\n\nYellow *jowar*, *bajra*, sesamum, cotton, *tuar* and other pulses form the *kharif* or monsoon crops; and gram, barley, cotton, and linseed are the chief *rabi* or cold-season crops. The total area of Government lands cropped in 1901 was 30,240 square miles, of which 94 per cent. was devoted to 'dry crops,' and 6 per cent. was irrigated.\n\nIn the Mar\u0101th\u0101 country only two crops are raised, the *rabi* and the *kharif*; while in Teleng\u0101na there are five crops, the *abi* and *t\u0101bi* for rice, and the *kharif*, *rabi*, and *m\u0101ghi* for 'dry crops,' the last being intermediate between the *kharif* and *rabi*.\n\nAs regards Mar\u0101thw\u0101ra, the extent of the *kharif* and *rabi* crops depends upon the rainfall. If the monsoon commences in June, *kharif* crops are largely sown at the beginning of the season; but if the rains are late and the time for the *kharif* sowing has passed, then more land is reserved for the *rabi*. In Teleng\u0101na, where there is a smaller extent of *rabi* lands, the *kharif* sowing proceeds as late as July, closely followed by the *m\u0101ghi* sowing. Certain kinds of rice may be sown in the *abi* so late as the beginning of August, if the rains are late; and the *t\u0101bi* or hot-season rice crop is sown from December up to the end of February.\nThe cultivator begins preparing his land for the kharif sowings in December or January, and for the rabi during the monsoon, whenever there is a break in the rains. The regar is ploughed with the large plough or n\u0101gar, drawn by eight bullocks, only once in seven or eight years, the bakkhar or harrow being considered sufficient in intermediate years. The Teleng\u0101na soils, being mostly sandy and finely divided, require only slight ploughing and harrowing. The land is ploughed first in one direction, and the second ploughing is done at right angles to the first. The ploughing is repeated till the soil is perfectly pulverized and clean.\n\nThe land thus prepared is then ready to receive the seed; and after the first shower or two, on the breaking of the monsoon in June, kharif sowings are commenced. In Teleng\u0101na, after a few good showers have fallen, the land for rice cultivation is ploughed by buffaloes and left for a few days. The seed, which has been soaked beforehand and has sprouted, is now sown broadcast in the fields and ploughed in. But in fields irrigated from large tanks, the preparation of the \u2018wet\u2019 lands begins even before the monsoon. For the rabi sowings, the land, which has been ploughed during the breaks in the rainy season, is sown in September or October, as at this time there are usually autumn showers which help the germination of the seed. For the t\u0101bi or hot-season rice crop, the land is first soaked with water from tanks and wells. The sowings proceed for two and even three months, from the beginning of December to the end of February.\n\nThe Mar\u0101th\u0101 cultivator has his kharif and rabi crops weeded three or four times during the season; the Teleng\u0101na ryot, on the other hand, is generally careless, weeding both crops only once or twice. His attention is chiefly devoted to the rice crop, which pays him best, and he weeds that three or four times during the season.\n\nYellow jow\u0101r, bajra, and the rainy season rice ripen about December; and white jow\u0101r, gram, wheat, barley, and the hot-season rice ripen from April to the end of May.\n\nCotton is extensively raised in all the black-soil Districts, as well as in Teleng\u0101na, wherever there is a suitable soil for its production. The short-stapled variety is the only kind which the cultivator grows, as he finds it easiest to produce. In the Districts served by railways, cotton-ginning and pressing factories are taking the place of the old system of hand-ginning; and within the last four years several of these factories have been opened in those Districts, the railway having made it possible for the machinery required to be conveyed to parts where it was impossible to transport it in carts. Railway extension has also given an impetus to the cultivation of cotton and superior cereals.\n\nOf the total population of the State in 1901, 5,132,902, or 46 per\ncent., were supported by agriculture. Of these, 58,858 were landholders or rent receivers, 3,454,284 were rent payers, 186,671 were farm servants, and 836,972 were field labourers.\n\nThe principal crops in the Mar\u0101th\u0101 country consist of jow\u0101r, bajra, wheat, cotton, linseed, and pulses; and those in Teleng\u0101na are rice, yellow jow\u0101r, bajra, castor-seed, sesame, and pulses. The staple food of the people of Mar\u0101thw\u0101ra consists of jow\u0101r, bajra, and, to some extent, wheat; while in Teleng\u0101na, rice, jow\u0101r, and bajra are consumed. Pulses and inferior grains of many kinds are grown everywhere. Oilseeds include linseed, sesame (gingelly), karar, and castor-seed, the two last being grown very largely in the Teleng\u0101na Districts. Besides cotton, san-hemp and amb\u0101ri are the principal fibre-plants, while aloes and bhendi fibre are not unknown. Large quantities of chillies are grown everywhere, and zira (caraway) and ajwain (Ligusticum Ajowan) are also grown in the Districts of Bidar, Atraf-i-balda, and Sirpur Tandur. In 1901 the areas occupied by the several important crops and their percentages to the total area cropped were as follows:\n\n| Crop                  | Area       | Percentage |\n|-----------------------|------------|------------|\n| Jow\u0101r                 | 12,531 sq mi | 41.4%      |\n| Cotton                | 3,226      | 10.7%      |\n| Bajra                 | 2,487      | 8.2%       |\n| Rice                  | 1,358      | 4.5%       |\n| Til (Sesamum orientale)| 1,263     | 4.2%       |\n| Wheat                 | 914        | 3.0%       |\n| Castor-seed           | 883        | 2.9%       |\n| Gram                  | 768        | 2.6%       |\n| Linseed               | 622        | 2.0%       |\n| Tuar                  | 561        | 1.9%       |\n| Karar                 | 531        | 1.7%       |\n| Maize                 | 484        | 1.6%       |\n| Kala or kongni        | 425        | 1.4%       |\n| Mung (Phaseolus Mungo)| 307        | 1.0%       |\n| Kodro (Paspalum scrobiculatum) | 177 | 0.6%       |\n| Chillies              | 149        | 0.5%       |\n| Tobacco               | 125        | 0.4%       |\n\nThe yield per acre of different crops varies so much that it is difficult to give a fair average; the weight of rice, for instance, ranges between 3 cwt. and 23 cwt. per acre. An attempt, however, has been made to give an average from figures obtained from the several Districts. Raw sugar, $18\\frac{1}{2}$ cwt.; rice, $10\\frac{1}{4}$ cwt.; jow\u0101r, $2\\frac{1}{2}$ cwt.; wheat, $2\\frac{1}{2}$ cwt.; bajra, $2\\frac{1}{4}$ cwt.; s\u0101w\u0101n, $2\\frac{1}{4}$ cwt.; kulthi, 2 cwt.; castor-seed, 2 cwt.; gram, $1\\frac{1}{4}$ cwt.; sesame, $1\\frac{1}{2}$ cwt.; linseed, $1\\frac{1}{3}$ cwt.; and cotton, 641 lb.\n\nAll the rice and sugar-cane fields are manured, the latter very heavily. The manure generally used is that obtained from the village cattle, and the sweepings from the village, and from leaves and branches of trees. Jow\u0101r and wheat in the regar receive no manure.\nRotation of crops in the Teleng\u0101na Districts is followed in the inferior kinds of soils called chatka. When waste lands are first prepared, oil-seeds are sown for the first year; the next year yellow jow\u0101r is grown, and in subsequent years they are put under s\u0101w\u0101n (Panicum frumentaceum) and kodro (Paspalum scrobiculatum). In lands of a better description, if the soil has become exhausted, jow\u0101r is followed by cotton. Yellow jow\u0101r, being a very exhausting crop, is never grown for two successive seasons on the same land. Where new land is of better quality, such as regar and mitwa, and is suited for rabi crops, it is usual first to sow kulthi (Dolichos biflorus), l\u0101kh, or castor-seed. These are followed in the next year by kulthi, gram, or peas. In the third year jow\u0101r is grown, mixed with linseed or kardi gram; after that, jow\u0101r and kulthi are sown every alternate year. In rice lands no regular rotation is followed, but sugar-cane and betel-leaf are sometimes raised. In the Mar\u0101th\u0101 Districts the rotation is as follows. When waste land is prepared for the kharif sowing, it is first put under b\u0101jra or cotton; and for two or three years afterwards only b\u0101jra is raised. Then, successively, m\u0101ng, urd, matt, or san-hemp is grown; and when the land is in a fit condition for being ploughed, a tuar crop follows. The roots of this crop strike deep into the soil and loosen it, thereby making ploughing easy. When waste land is prepared for rabi cultivation, jow\u0101r or kardi is sown first, followed by wheat or jow\u0101r for the next four or five years. In \u2018wet\u2019 cultivation sugar-cane is followed by rice in the next year.\n\nOranges are extensively grown in and around Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, Parbhani, and Nirmal, but at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d and other places they are found only in private gardens. Ordinary mangoes are produced everywhere, but very superior grafted mangoes are grown in gardens around Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. During the rainy season, country vegetables are raised in all parts, but English vegetables are grown only at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, its suburbs, and at Secunder\u0101b\u0101d, and also at some District head-quarters. Excellent grapes were formerly grown at Daulat\u0101b\u0101d, and an attempt is being made to revive their cultivation.\n\nThe area under cultivation has considerably increased during the last twenty years. Large tracts of unoccupied cultivable land are still to be found in the Sirpur T\u0101nd\u016br, Mahbubnagar, Warangal, Elgandal, and Ind\u016br Districts of Teleng\u0101na. In the Mar\u0101th\u0101 Districts the whole of the cultivable land has been taken up. The ryots have taken no interest in improving the quality of their crops by selection of seed, or by the cultivation of new varieties, or by introducing improved agricultural implements.\n\nIn the Mar\u0101th\u0101 tract, a large heavy plough is used for breaking up the hard black soil, which is drawn by four or five yoke of cattle, but in Teleng\u0101na a light plough is employed. Other implements\nare bullock-hoes, the bakkhar (harrow), and the tippan (seed-drills). The ordinary mot or leathern bucket is the most common water-lift, and is worked by a pair of bullocks. On the banks of rivers and streams, the yatam or bhudki (a lever-like contrivance) is used by one or two men.\n\nThere is no agricultural department in the State at present. The duties of a department of Land Records are performed by the Revenue department. Advances for the construction of wells are given by the State in times of scarcity and famine. The well and field are assigned as security, and the loan is repaid by instalments, interest being paid at 6 per cent. per annum. The cultivators are often largely indebted to the money-lender, and frequently become tenants of their creditors. Money is usually advanced by professional money-lenders, but wealthy agriculturists also lend money. Agricultural banks established on sound principles would probably succeed and would be beneficial to the cultivators. The ordinary rate of interest on money advanced is nominally 25 per cent. for the season. The money-lender advances a loan on the security of the future crop, and at harvest time receives 25 per cent. as interest in cash or in kind, at prices ruling at the time, so that the real interest is about 50 per cent. per annum.\n\nWith the exception of the white cattle of Eastern Teleng\u0101na, the Khammamett and Devarkonda cattle, and the small bullocks of Adilab\u0101d District and the Amr\u0101b\u0101d taluk, no special breeds of cattle are to be found in the State. The white cattle are indigenous to the country, and are a hardy stock, with black-tipped tails. The Khammamett and Devarkonda breeds are much stronger than the white cattle, and resemble the Mysore breed. The Sirpur T\u0101nd\u016br and Amr\u0101b\u0101d bullocks are of small size, but are fast trotters. The waste lands and forests of the Teleng\u0101na Districts are the pasture-grounds where they breed. Horses adapted for military and general purposes were formerly reared in large numbers, but the importation of Arabs and Australian horses has diminished the demand. The Government maintains a few Arab sires in some of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 and Teleng\u0101na Districts, and it is believed that the result has been satisfactory. The Deccan ponies are still noted for their surefootedness, hardiness, and powers of endurance. The other animals, such as buffaloes, goats, and sheep, are all of the ordinary type. The Mar\u0101th\u0101-w\u0101r\u0101 buffaloes are very superior milch cattle, and fetch double or treble the price of the ordinary buffaloes of Teleng\u0101na. Sheep and goats of the ordinary kind are bred everywhere. In most of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 districts, goats of the Gujar\u0101t breed are reared, which generally yield a good supply of milk. The price of cattle varies from Rs. 40 to Rs. 150 or even Rs. 200 per pair; that of ponies from Rs. 15 to Rs. 150 each. Milch buffaloes in Teleng\u0101na are worth from Rs. 30\nto Rs. 45, but in the Mar\u0101th\u0101 Districts they fetch from Rs. 50 to Rs. 150. Sheep and goats are sold at from Rs. 2 to Rs. 3-8 per head, and milch goats at from Rs. 7 to Rs. 20 or Rs. 25.\n\nThe last famine caused great mortality among cattle in the famine-stricken districts. Grazing lands have been set apart, but in dry seasons the grass in them is very poor. Kadbi, or jow\u0101r stalks, form the chief fodder supply, of which more than sufficient is raised in good years, and large quantities are stacked to meet requirements in times of scarcity.\n\nUntil recently (1897), a great horse fair was held annually at Malegaon, in Bidar District, at which a large number of horses and cattle were sold; but for several years past the fair has not taken place owing to the prevalence of plague. At Hyder\u0101b\u0101d there is an extensive horse mart. In every District weekly or monthly horse and cattle fairs are held.\n\nThe Mar\u0101th\u0101 country being composed of black soil, there is not so much necessity for irrigation as in Teling\u0101na; the black soil has the power to retain moisture, which is further supplemented during the cold season by a copious deposit of dew, which supplies the crops with moisture sufficient for their growth and maturity. Where rice, sugar-cane, and garden produce are raised, the chief sources of supply are wells. The Teling\u0101na soils being sandy, it becomes of paramount importance to store water; and for this purpose advantage has been taken of the undulating character of the ground. Dams have been thrown across the valleys of streams and gorges between hills, and rain-water which falls over a large catchment basin is thus collected, and made available for purposes of irrigation by means of sluices.\n\nBesides the tanks and kuntas or ponds, irrigation is carried on by means of wells generally, and by means of canals and anicuts in certain districts. For rice, sugar-cane, and turmeric the land is constantly watered as long as the crops are standing, while b\u0101gh\u0101t, or garden lands, require only occasional irrigation. Wheat and barley are usually sown near wells and are watered from them once a week. Across the Tungabhadra, in Lingsug\u016br District, a series of anicuts have been constructed to hold up the water, which is directed into side channels and is used for supplying tanks and lands along the banks of the river. There are several anicuts in a length of 30 miles on the Tungabhadra, the principal one being at Kurag\u0101l, which extends completely across the river. All of these anicuts were built many years ago, and no statistics are obtainable regarding their cost. A new project is now under construction for taking water from the M\u0101njra river in Medak District for irrigation purposes and the supply of tanks.\n\nThe water from Government tanks is utilized for irrigating the 'wet'\nlands, which pay a water tax. There are altogether 370 large tanks and 11,015 kuntas or ponds, besides 1,347 channels, in the State. The large tanks are maintained by the Public Works department, while the smaller ones, as well as kuntas, are in charge of Revenue officers; but since the introduction of the dastband system, zamindars and local officials and others have taken up some of the breached tanks, receiving a certain percentage for their maintenance after reconstruction. These, however, are mostly tanks of no very large size.\n\nMost of the tanks\u2014such as the Husain Sagar, the Ibr\u0101himpatan, the M\u012br Alam, the Afzal Sagar, the Jalpalli, and many other large tanks, as well as irrigation channels\u2014were constructed by the former rulers or ministers of the State. The minor tanks are the work of zamindars. No complete record is available as to the actual capital outlay, but those constructed in recent years will be described in dealing with Public Works.\n\nThe land served by wells is irrigated by the old primitive method of lifting the water by means of large buckets drawn by bullocks. The total number of wells in the State is 12,3175. Where any supply channels from a river or a perennial stream are constructed to carry water to tanks, the ryots sometimes bail out water on either side of the channel by means of hand-buckets called bhurki or guda, and so get a constant flow. Masonry wells cost between Rs. 400 and Rs. 600, and those lined with stone without any mortar between Rs. 200 and Rs. 300; such wells have two bullock runs and two buckets, and are capable of irrigating 4 to 5 acres of rice or sugar-cane, and 10 acres of garden land.\n\nAs ryotwari is the prevailing revenue system throughout Hyderabad, the sum paid by the cultivator represents the land revenue, which will be dealt with later. In the case of deserted villages, which have been leased by the State, the holder is free to charge his tenants what rent he pleases, provided the rates do not exceed those previously paid to the State. The pattadars or ryots, who hold directly from the State, sometimes sublet the whole or a part of their lands or take partners called shikmidars. The latter cultivate land in partnership with the pattadars, and divide the produce and expenses in proportion to the cattle employed by each, the pattadar receiving from his co-sharer a proportionate amount of the State dues. If he sublets, the occupant frequently receives from his sub-tenant an enhanced rental for the land in money or in kind. Inamdars and non-cultivating classes usually let their lands. The non-cultivating occupant, if he be a money-lender and has purchased the occupancy right of the land, generally obtains a larger rent or share from his sub-tenant than the inamdar, who, having no cattle of his own, is obliged\nto let his land for a small share. The money-lender, on the other hand, supplies his sub-tenant with funds to purchase cattle and implements, and either charges interest or lets his land at rates far higher than he himself pays to the State. The latter system is very common in the Mar\u0101th\u0101 Districts, where land has acquired a much higher value since the settlement, and where the non-cultivating classes, mostly comprising money-lenders, form a much higher proportion of the population than in Teleng\u0101na.\n\nNo official returns of the prevailing rates of wages are available. Agricultural labourers and domestic servants may be taken as types of unskilled labour, and carpenters, blacksmiths, and masons as those of skilled labour. The former are paid from Rs. 30 to Rs. 36 per annum, besides receiving one meal a day, and a blanket and a pair of sandals every year. Sometimes the labourer borrows two or three years' wages from his employer for marriage expenses and undertakes to serve for a stipulated period at a reduced rate, the reduction representing the amount of interest on the sum borrowed. Wages are sometimes paid partly in cash and partly in kind. To persons hired by the day, wages are generally paid in grain, but in the case of cotton-picking the labourer gets a certain proportion of the quantity picked. Village artisans are usually paid in kind, and in some few instances partly in cash and partly in grain. When grain is dear, cash wages are substituted by the employer.\n\nIn the vicinity of towns cash wages are the rule; and wherever cotton-ginning and pressing factories are established, or mining industries developed, such as coal-mining and stone-quarrying, or railway and road construction are started, high cash wages are demanded, varying from Rs. 7 to Rs. 10 per month.\n\nIn times of scarcity wages fall considerably below the average, owing to the large number of labourers thrown out of employment. The favourable rates of assessment introduced since the last settlement have been conducive to much agricultural activity and a greater demand for labour, whereby wages have risen, and the labourer who got Rs. 30 per annum now demands Rs. 36. The same may be said of all other labourers, artisans, and domestic servants. The higher prices of food-grains have also contributed towards enhancement in the rates of wages.\n\nIn the absence of any regular record of prices, information specially collected has been embodied in Table III (p. 302). No records exist of prices prior to the construction of railways, but it is certain that prices were then much lower than now, because owing to the absence of means of transport only a small quantity of the grain produced was exported. The railways have made prices of grain uniform over large tracts; and in times of famine and scarcity in the neigh-\nbouring Provinces the surplus grain of the country is exported, thus causing a rise in prices. During the famines of 1897 and 1899-1900 prices of grain were extraordinarily high, though, while grain was being imported for the relief of the affected areas, it was being largely exported from the other parts of the State to Provinces where large profits were probable. During the famine of 1899-1900, jow\u0101r sold at 5 seers per rupee in Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, at 3\u00be seers in Bh\u012br and N\u0101nder, at 4\u00bc seers in Parbh\u0101ni and Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, and at 5\u00bc seers in B\u012bdar. In Table III the price of salt is given for Hyder\u0101b\u0101d only, the prices in the country being almost the same.\n\nA total area of nearly 18,000 square miles is under forests, which are divided into three classes: the \u2018reserved\u2019 (5,184 square miles), the protected (4,408 square miles), and the open or unprotected (8,387 square miles). In the \u2018reserved\u2019 and protected forests, trees are under the control of the Forest department; but in the open forests only sixteen species are reserved: namely, sandal (*Santalum album*), teak (*Tectona grandis*), shisham (*Dalbergia Sissoo*), ebony (*Diospyros melanoxylon*), satin-wood (*Chloroxylon Swietenia*), eppa (*Hardwickia binata*), nall\u0101madi (*Terminalia tomentosa*), bij\u0101s\u0101l (*Pterocarpus Marsupium*), batta-gunam (*Stephgyne parvifolia*), somi (*Soymida febrifuga*), dhaura or tirmani (*Anogeissus latifolia*), kodsha (*Cleistanthus collinus*), sandra (*Acacia Catechu*), bhand\u0101ra (*Adina cordifolia*), mokab (*Schrebera swietenioides*), and chinnangi (*Lagerstroemia parviflora*). The forests form six divisions\u2014Warangal, Ind\u016br, Nirmal, Mahb\u016bbnagar, Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, and G\u016blbarga\u2014the last two being in Mar\u0101thw\u0101ra, and the remainder in Teling\u0101na. Each division is under an Assistant Conservator. The management of this department is guided by the Forest Act of 1899, which empowers the Conservator to exercise full control over \u2018reserved\u2019 and protected forests, and reserved species of trees in open forests. Timber is supplied to purchasers at prescribed rates, while cultivators receive free timber and fuel for agricultural implements and domestic purposes. Minor produce, such as grass, branches, and leaves, &c., is likewise granted free to the local ryots. Free grazing is also permitted, under certain restrictions. After meeting the local demand, timber of various kinds is exported to different parts of the State. Local railways and the military workshop are also supplied with timber, exploited and transported departmentally. No use is made of elephants nor are floating operations resorted to.\n\nNo special fuel and fodder reserves are maintained, but the grazing in the \u2018reserved\u2019 and protected forests is regulated by the department, and fees are collected either departmentally or through contract agency. Grazing rights in the open forests are auctioned annually by the Revenue department. In years of scarcity cattle are sent to the\nforests, which are then thrown open to free grazing. Measures are adopted to prevent the destruction of trees for leaf fodder, and some attempts have been made to store fodder. Edible fruits, roots, and flowers are utilized during famines by the destitute and starving poor. Some of the valuable forests are protected from fire by making regular fire lines, prohibiting the carrying of inflammable materials, closing areas to grazing, and by the appointment of patrols and guards.\n\nThere are no special plantations of any economic value in the State. The following table shows the area of each class of forest in each forest division in 1901:\n\n| Forest Divisions | Area in square miles |\n|------------------|---------------------|\n|                  | Reserved | Protected | Open | Total |\n| Warangal         | 2,368    | ...       | 2,000 | 4,368 |\n| Ind\u016br            | 907      | 644       | 2,980 | 4,531 |\n| Nirmal           | 700      | 3,397     | 2,000 | 6,007 |\n| Mahb\u016bbnagar      | 800      | 322       | 547  | 1,669 |\n| Aurang\u0101b\u0101d       | 288      | 69        | 600  | 957   |\n| Gulbarga         | 121      | 66        | 260  | 447   |\n| **Total**        | **5,184** | **4,408** | **8,387** | **17,979** |\n\nAs the forest survey and demarcation have not been completed, the areas shown above are only approximate, and it is possible that as much as one-third of the total is really cultivated. The forests are not equally distributed in all parts, the two Districts of Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d and Bh\u012br having no forest at all, while the forests in Karimnagar (Elgandal), Warangal, and Adil\u0101b\u0101d (Sirpur T\u0101nd\u016br) occupy half the area of the State lands. The Mar\u0101th\u0101 Districts are far less wooded than the Teleng\u0101na country. The figures given below show the average revenue, expenditure, and surplus of the Forest department for a series of years:\n\n|                | Average for ten years ending 1890 | Average for ten years ending 1900 | 1901 | 1903 |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------|------|\n| Revenue        | Rs. 1,02,546                      | Rs. 2,02,004                      | Rs. 3,45,445 | Rs. 3,69,511 |\n| Expenditure    | Rs. 72,360                        | Rs. 1,14,904                      | Rs. 1,44,369 | Rs. 1,47,125 |\n| Surplus        | Rs. 30,186                        | Rs. 87,100                        | Rs. 2,01,076 | Rs. 2,22,386 |\n\nThe practice of shifting cultivation in forests, or *pode*, which was very common some years ago, is now strictly prohibited; but illicit clearances for temporary cultivation are sometimes made, and, when found out, departmental punishment is inflicted on the offenders.\n\nSeveral grasses are known to possess economic properties. The\nfibres of *mannakopri* and *modian* are extensively used for making ropes, for stringing cots, and for various agricultural uses. If properly treated, these might also prove suitable for manufacturing paper. Among other minor products, *mahu\u0101* flowers are of importance as being generally used for distilling country liquor.\n\nThe Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State is rich in minerals, chief among which may be mentioned the extensive coal-measures of Warangal and the gold-mines of Lingsug\u016br. The coal-field of Singareni was discovered by Dr. King of the Indian Geological Survey so far back as 1872. Active operations were, however, delayed till 1886, when the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d (Deccan) Company obtained a concession, and opened the mine at Singareni, which is the only mine profitably worked at present. Four distinct seams have been discovered in the Singareni field. The first varies in thickness from 30 to 50 feet, and is composed of alternating layers of coal and carbonaceous shale, the former being of tolerably good quality and supplying a fair steam coal. The second seam, lying about 100 feet below the first, consists of shaly coal. Similarly, the third seam, which is about 30 to 40 feet below the second, consists of a hard shaly coal; and as the coal these two contain gives 30 per cent. of ash, they have been abandoned as being of no commercial value. The fourth seam, called the King seam after its discoverer, consists of the most valuable coal, being semi-bituminous hard coal which does not coke but yields a good gas for lighting purposes. This is the seam which is now being worked. Its thickness is from 3 to 7 feet and its area about 9 square miles, and at the average thickness of 5 feet it is computed to contain no less than 47,500,000 tons of coal. The royalty paid to the State varies from 8 annas to R. 1 per ton. In 1896 the royalty realized was Rs. 1,25,000. The output of coal from the Singareni coal-field rose from 3,259 tons in 1887 to 144,668 in 1891, and 421,218 in 1901, and was 419,546 tons in 1904.\n\nGold occurs in Lingsug\u016br District, in the rocks of the transition series, in the Muski, Bomanh\u0101l, and S\u0101gar formations. The total area of gold-bearing rocks in this territory, as proved by the Geological Survey of India and by the prospecting operations of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d (Deccan) Company, is about 1,240 square miles. The first band of rock lies between the Tungabhadra and Kistna rivers, and is composed essentially of a schistose black hornblendic trappoid. This band was actively prospected in 1896-7 by the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d (Deccan) Company, and a subsidiary company has since been formed to work the quartz. The average yield here, it is alleged, has been an ounce to the ton, and certain specimens have yielded as much as 20 oz. to the ton, but this is rare. Want of water for working the stamps has hampered operations, but this difficulty has been got over by the construction of\nan artificial reservoir. The next band is at Bomanh\u0101l, extending from the left bank of the Kistna west of S\u016br\u0101pur for about 20 miles, and disappearing under the black cotton soil between the Bh\u012bma and the Kistna. This band is not more than 3 miles in width and is chiefly composed of hornblendic schists. Undoubted traces of old workings have been found in this locality, and from this it is inferred that this band may yet prove profitable. The third band, that of S\u0101gar between S\u0101gar and S\u016br\u0101pur, is not of much importance.\n\nInnumerable deposits of iron ore of varying qualities are widely distributed over the lateritic and granitic tracts of the State, while similar deposits have been discovered in the sandstone formations in the God\u0101vari and Wardh\u0101 valleys. In the tract situated between the Kistna and Tungabhadra rivers, hematite occurs in considerable quantities. The rocks of the Kamptee series, which are extensively developed between the God\u0101vari and Wardh\u0101 valleys, abound in hard ferruginous pebbles and clay iron ores, and are worked in the Chinn\u016br t\u0101luk of Adil\u0101b\u0101d District. Jagti\u0101l, Nirmal, Warangal, Yelgarab, and other places are noted for their cast-steel cakes or disks, which were largely exported to distant parts.\n\nFrom ancient times diamond mines have been worked in the alluvial deposits round about Party\u0101l, near the Kistna, as well as in other localities in the alluvial tract of the same river. The Party\u0101l diamond-bearing layer is about 10 to 16 inches thick, and is concealed by black cotton soil. Trials made in recent years by the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d (Deccan) Company, involving a considerable outlay, proved unsuccessful; only stones of very small size were found, the gangue having been worked out by the old miners.\n\nAmong other minerals found in the country may be mentioned mica in the Khammamett t\u0101luk of Warangal; fine specimens of corundum and garnets in the P\u0101loncha t\u0101luk of the same District; and a small deposit of graphite in the vicinity of Hasan\u0101b\u0101d in Karimnagar (Elgandal) District. A copper lode has recently been discovered at Chintr\u0101la in Nalgonda District, which promises to be remunerative. Excellent limestone is quarried at Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d, between the W\u0101di Junction and Gulbarga on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. These quarries are extensively worked on both sides of the line for a considerable distance. The limestone is of two colours, black and grey, the latter being the more abundant of the two, and taking a polish almost equal to marble. An extensive industry has been carried on, and the stone is not only being widely used for flooring purposes, but is exported outside the State also in large quantities for building purposes. In addition to the minerals already mentioned, red chalk and saline deposits are found.\n\nCotton-weaving is carried on in almost every t\u0101luk; and s\u0101ris, dhotis,\nand coarse cloth called kh\u0101di are woven by hand in every large village and used largely by the people, who find these, though coarse and unattractive in appearance, more durable than the goods made in mills. S\u0101ris of silk and other silk stuffs are made in Nalgonda, Raichur, Mahbubnagar (N\u0101r\u0101yanpet taluk), Lingsugur, Aurangabad, Indur, Elgandal, and other Districts, some of these being of extra fine quality and very durable, and fetching very high prices. In later years the silk-cloth industry in Nalgonda has improved, where the S\u0101lis, a caste of silk-weavers, are doing good work. Their example is being followed by others of their caste in the adjoining Districts. Aurangabad and Paithan have been noted from olden times for their embroidery and gold and silver lace-work. Kamkhw\u0101b, or cloth woven with silver and gold of superior quality, was once made at Paithan, but the manufacture is now practically confined to Aurangabad, where about a dozen looms are at work. Lately, the himru industry has considerably increased and patterns have been improved. This cloth is a mixture of silk and cotton producing different patterns, and the new varieties include imitations of Kashmir shawls. The great advantage of this stuff is that it is washable. Other stuffs such as elaicha and mashr\u016b are still made, the demand for these being very great. Muslin of a very fine texture is made in Nander and Amarchinta, but this industry is unfortunately dying out for want of support.\n\nBrocades of coloured silk and gold and silver thread of very fine quality are made at Aurangabad and Vaijapur. Tasar silk is largely used for making scarfs, s\u0101ris, and other silk fabrics. The tasar cocoons are gathered in the jungles of the southern and eastern Districts, the silk is made in exactly the same way as that obtained from cultivated cocoons, and a very durable silk cloth is manufactured from it at Warangal, Mathwada, and Hasanparti in Warangal District, at N\u0101r\u0101yanpet in Mahbubnagar District, and Kosgi in Gulbarga District. In the vicinity of the P\u0101kh\u0101l lake this silkworm abounds in the jungles, but the best description of tasar silk is manufactured at N\u0101r\u0101yanpet and at Mah\u0101deopur in Elgandal District.\n\nWarangal was formerly noted for its woollen and silk carpets and rugs, samples of which have been sent to European exhibitions, where they commanded a good sale. The use of aniline dyes, however, has caused much injury to the trade, owing to the fading of the colours. Shatranjis of very good quality are made in the Gulbarga and Warangal Central jails, as also at many District head-quarters.\n\nAurangabad is noted for its silver-ware and silver ornaments. Bedstead legs, spittoons, pandans, and other silver articles used in marriages by the wealthy natives, are manufactured there in large quantities. Fine filigree and wire-work is done both in Aurangabad and Karimnagar.\n(Elgandal), some specimens showing exceedingly delicate workmanship.\n\nBidri ware\u2014so named from Bidar town, where it is manufactured\u2014consists of an alloy of zinc, copper, tin, and lead; and after the vessels, &c., are made, the surface is inlaid with silver and sometimes with gold, and finally turned and polished. The articles made are ewers, jugs, wash-hand basins, bedstead legs, pindans, betel-nut boxes, hukkas, spittoons, cups, and other kinds of vessels. Sometimes sword and dagger handles are also made of bidri ware. The work is very neat, delicate, and highly artistic, and the patterns are exceedingly good.\n\nSword-blades and other weapons were once extensively made in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, Wanparti, Gadw\u0101l, Kolhapur, Jagdeopur, and other places, but they were not of so good a quality as those imported from Persia, which commanded high prices. The industry is dying out from the circumstances of the age. Inferior smooth-bore muskets used to be made in the city factory for the use of the police and irregular troops, but the factory has now been abolished. Daggers and knives used by the Arabs and other irregulars were formerly produced at Gadw\u0101l, Jagdeopur, and other places near Hyder\u0101b\u0101d from Nirmal steel, but they are rarely made now.\n\nThe factory industries consist of ginning and pressing factories at Aurang\u0101b\u0101d and J\u0101lna in Aurang\u0101b\u0101d District, M\u0101zalgaon and Parli in Bh\u012br District, Raich\u016br and Y\u0101dgir in Raich\u016br District, L\u0101t\u016br in Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, Udgir in Bidar, and also in Warangal, Ind\u016br, Parbhani, and N\u0101nder Districts.\n\nThere are three spinning and weaving-mills in the State, employing 2,712 hands: namely, those of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d (Deccan) Spinning and Weaving Company, near Hyder\u0101b\u0101d; the Gulbarga Mahb\u016bb Sh\u0101hi Mills Company, at Gulbarga; and the Aurang\u0101b\u0101d Spinning and Manufacturing Company, in Aurang\u0101b\u0101d city. The first of these mills commenced work in 1877, while the others were opened in 1886 and 1889. Together they represent a capital of 31 lakhs. The following table shows the statistics of progress:\n\n|                      | 1880-1. | 1890-1. | 1900-1. |\n|----------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Number of mills      |         |         |         |\n| Number of looms      | 1       | 3       | 3       |\n| Number of spindles   | 169     | 443     | 459     |\n| Hands employed       | 14,958  | 50,713  | 49,465  |\n\nRegular statistics of trade are not maintained, but a general guide to the nature and direction of trade is obtained from the customs and railway returns. The principal exports are food-grains, cotton, linseed, sesamum, ground nuts, castor seed, indigo, oils, timber, cotton cloth, hides, cattle,\nand coal; while the chief imports are mill-made cloth, yarn, raw silk, salt, refined sugar, dried fruits, betel-nuts, horses, cattle, silver and gold, copper and brass in sheets and utensils, iron, timber, mineral oil, and opium.\n\nThe State is divided, for the purpose of levying customs duties on articles entering or leaving the country by the ordinary trade-routes, into nine customs divisions, five of which\u2014Naldrug, J\u0101lma, Lingsugur, R\u0101j\u016bra, and Kod\u0101r\u2014deal exclusively with road-borne trade, while the remaining four\u2014Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, Secunder\u0101b\u0101d, Warangal, and Gulbarga\u2014deal with both rail-borne and road-borne traffic. Besides the places already mentioned, the following distributing centres are important: Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, N\u0101nder, Parbhani, Hingoli, Parli, S\u016br\u0101pur, Koppal, L\u0101t\u016br, Raich\u016br, Seram, Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d, N\u0101r\u0101yanpet, Sad\u0101seopet, Siddipet, Ind\u016br, Karkeli, Khammamett, and Edl\u0101b\u0101d. Complete statistics showing the quantities of exports and imports at each of these places are not prepared by the Customs department, as articles comprised in the customs tariff are alone registered. The railway returns show only the weight of rail-borne traffic.\n\nIn the absence of reliable statistics, it is impossible to estimate the amount of the internal trade of the State, but there is no doubt that it far exceeds the foreign trade. For the purpose of export, the produce of the country is collected from the interior at certain important centres. There is also a large interchange of commodities of local growth and production between adjoining Districts. The same agency that is employed for collecting the produce for export also performs the office of distributing imported articles to distant parts by means of carts and pack-bullocks. The trading castes are represented by the Jain V\u0101nis in the Mar\u0101th\u0101 Districts, by Ling\u0101yat V\u0101nis in the Carnatic, and by Komatis in Teling\u0101na, while M\u0101rw\u0101ri traders are to be found in all the large villages. The village Bani\u0101 is a general tradesman, being grain-dealer, cloth-vendor, and banker. He it is who advances to the ryot the amount to enable him to meet the land revenue, and at harvest time takes charge of the produce, which he passes on to the agents of wholesale exporters at large centres or the nearest railway station.\n\nGoods and commodities imported from British territory are brought in either by rail direct to important stations in the State, or in the case of frontier Districts, where there are no railways, by means of carts and pack-bullocks from commercial centres outside Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, such as B\u0101rsi, Shol\u0101pur, Ahmadnagar, Kurnool, Adoni, Bellary, Bij\u0101pur, Jaggayyapeta, Bezw\u0101da, Bhadr\u0101chalam, R\u0101jahmundry, and Chandarpur. The rail-borne imports are mostly from Bombay, and to a smaller extent from Madras. With regard to exports, the produce of the frontier Districts finds its way to the same centres, but that of the interior is carried to the nearest railway station, whence it is either\nsent to Hyder\u0101b\u0101d or consigned to Bombay or Madras. The chief channels of trade are the Great Indian Peninsula Railway in the west and the south, and the Madras and East Coast Railways in the south and east. These are connected with the Niz\u0101m\u2019s Guaranteed State Railway, which traverses the State from W\u0101di in the west to Bezw\u0101da in the east. The Hyder\u0101b\u0101d-God\u0101v\u0101ri Valley Railway, which passes through the central and north-western Districts, connects the capital with Manm\u0101d in the N\u0101sik District of Bombay. Numerous feeder-roads in the interior convey commodities to and from the various stations on the State Railway. The principal exports to Bombay in 1903 consisted of linseed (46,466 tons), castor-seed (45,090 tons), other seeds (29,550 tons), hides and skins (527 tons), and miscellaneous including raw cotton (123,443 tons); the exports to Madras in the same year were linseed (5,233 tons), castor-seed (14,095 tons), other seeds (5,094 tons), hides and skins (3,136 tons), and miscellaneous (26,845 tons). The imports from Bombay consisted of cotton twist and yarn (7,541 tons), cotton piece-goods (5,194 tons), grain (13,632 tons), kerosene oil (8,522 tons), fruits and provisions (7,110 tons), iron (7,391 tons), tobacco (25 tons), and salt (33,848 tons); and from Madras, yarn (240 tons), piece-goods (451 tons), grain (47,688 tons), tobacco (2,062 tons), and fruit and provisions (1,703 tons); while from stations outside the two Presidencies the imports consisted only of grain (4,731 tons). The total exports by rail in 1901 amounted to 113,340 tons, and the total imports to 122,345 tons; and in 1903 they were 300,679 and 152,334 tons respectively. These figures are exclusive of the coal exported, the figures and value of which are shown below:\n\n| Year | Tons   | Value |\n|------|--------|-------|\n| 1891 | 81,882 | Rs. 7,66,270 |\n| 1901 | 343,945| Rs. 18,61,940 |\n| 1903 | 291,499| Rs. 17,58,444 |\n\nThe south-western corner of the State is crossed for 137 miles by the broad-gauge line from Bombay to Madras. About 120 miles of this line belong to the south-eastern section of the Great Indian Peninsula, while the remainder is part of the north-western branch of the Madras Railway, the junction being at Raich\u016br. From W\u0101di on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, the Niz\u0101m\u2019s Guaranteed State Railway runs east to Warangal and then south-east towards Bezw\u0101da on the East Coast section of the Madras Railway. The total length of the main line is 310 miles, while two branches from Husain S\u0101gar to Hyder\u0101b\u0101d and from Dornakal to the Singareni coal-fields add 20 miles. The Hyder\u0101b\u0101d-God\u0101v\u0101ri Valley Railway (metre gauge) runs for 391 miles north-west from Hyder\u0101b\u0101d city to Manm\u0101d on the north-eastern section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. The State thus contains 467 miles on the broad\ngauge, all built before 1891, and 391 miles on the narrow gauge, opened between 1899 and 1901.\n\nThe Nizam's Guaranteed State Railway is owned and worked by a company under a guarantee from the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, and the same company works the metre-gauge line, capital for which was raised by the issue of redeemable mortgage debentures.\n\nThe total capital expenditure on the Niz\u0101m's State Railway to the end of 1904 was 4\u00b73 crores, and in that year the net earnings were nearly 28 lakhs, or about $6\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. on the outlay. The Hyder\u0101b\u0101d-God\u0101vari Valley Railway has cost 2\u00b76 crores, and earned 7\u00b77 lakhs net in the same year, or nearly 3 per cent.; but in 1901 and 1902 the earnings had been about $3\\frac{1}{4}$ per cent.\n\nWith the exception of some roads in the immediate vicinity of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d city, none of the roads in the State can be considered as equal to roads described as first-class in British India, and even these are gravelled rather than metalled. Prior to 1868 there were trunk roads leading from Hyder\u0101b\u0101d to Shol\u0101pur, Gulbarga, Kurnool, Masulipatam, Hanamkonda, and N\u0101gpur, some of which were originally constructed by the British military authorities to facilitate the movements of troops. They were eventually made over to the State about 1867.\n\nThe following are the principal roads: The Hyder\u0101b\u0101d-N\u0101gpur road runs due north, leaving the State at Pullara in Adil\u0101b\u0101d (Sirpur T\u0101nd\u016br) District, 195 miles from the capital. This road is partly bridged and well maintained, and is passable at all seasons. The Hyder\u0101b\u0101d-Jalna road is 265 miles long, and proceeds via B\u012bdar, Udgir, and Gang\u0101kher. Up to B\u012bdar, the road is good and practicable at all seasons, but beyond it is only a fair-weather road. A bridged road connects Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, via Homn\u0101b\u0101d and Naldrug, with the Shol\u0101pur railway station; 180 miles long. Before the extension of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway beyond Shol\u0101pur, this was the main road from Hyder\u0101b\u0101d to the Bombay side. The Hyder\u0101b\u0101d-Kurnool road is passable at all seasons and is 136 miles long. A branch from Jedcherla to the Kistna river, 60 miles in length, was constructed between 1879 and 1882. Another branch road starts from the sixty-ninth mile and proceeds by Makhtal to the Kistna station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, 42 miles, while a third extends to Raich\u016br, 55 miles. This last forms a part of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d-Bellary road, with a total length of 158 miles. The Hyder\u0101b\u0101d-Masulipatam road, partly bridged and passable at all seasons, has a length of 116 miles in the State. From the sixtieth mile of this road the old Madras road branches off. A made road connects Hyder\u0101b\u0101d with Warangal, 91 miles, and proceeds thence to Mangampet on the God\u0101vari, 72 miles. The former section was constructed in 1868\u201371 and the latter in 1871\u20136.\nThe other principal roads are Hyder\u0101b\u0101d to Medak, 54 miles; Aurang\u0101b\u0101d to Nandgaon on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, 54 miles, 43 of which lie in the State; Aurang\u0101b\u0101d to J\u0101lna, 39 miles; Aurang\u0101b\u0101d to Toka, 25 miles; Aurang\u0101b\u0101d to Bh\u012br, 72 miles; Bh\u012br to Ahmadnagar railway station, 70 miles, and then south via Parenda to the B\u0101rsi Road station; Naldrug to Gulbarga, $52\\frac{1}{3}$ miles; Naldrug to Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d (Dh\u0101r\u0101seo), $32\\frac{1}{2}$ miles; Gulbarga to S\u016br\u0101pur, 60 miles; Raichur to Lingsug\u016br, 55 miles, being part of the old road from Kurnool to Dh\u0101rw\u0101r; the Bhongir-Nalgonda road, 40 miles long; and the branch road from Homn\u0101b\u0101d to Gulbarga railway station, 36 miles. Many of these roads now serve as feeders to railway stations.\n\nAfter the extension of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway beyond Shol\u0101pur in the direction of Gulbarga and Raichur, 13 feeder-roads were constructed with a total length of 382 miles; and when the Niz\u0101m\u2019s Guaranteed State Railway was opened from Secunder\u0101b\u0101d to W\u0101di in 1874, seven more feeder-roads were completed, totalling $97\\frac{1}{2}$ miles. Eleven years later the railway was extended from Secunder\u0101b\u0101d to Warangal, and thence to Dornakal, necessitating the construction of 13 new roads to serve as feeders to this section of the railway. Subsequently, at the request of the railway company, 15 roads, with a total length of 109 miles, were constructed as feeders to the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d-God\u0101vari Valley Railway.\n\nIn 1891 there were 1,241 miles of road under maintenance, costing 3 lakhs, while in 1901, 1,614 miles were maintained at a cost of $5\\frac{1}{2}$ lakhs. The Local fund roads are not included in these figures. Improvements in the method of maintenance accompanied the increased grants in 1901, and portions of roads and bridges have been reconstructed.\n\nIn the interior of the State the only means of transport are pack-bullocks and the ordinary two-wheeled country cart drawn by a pair of bullocks. The majority of the carts are crude in appearance, but are constructed of well-seasoned wood by the village carpenter and blacksmith, and are very serviceable. They consist of a framework of wood, placed across a log, through which passes an iron axle, while the bullocks are yoked to a long pole attached to the log at right angles, below the framework. In the two longer side pieces are fixed uprights 2 feet high, secured by another piece of wood on top. The wheels have tires made from country iron.\n\nThe Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State maintains its own postal system for internal communications and issues stamps. State correspondence was conveyed by contractors for a stipulated amount from 1856 to 1869, in which year the State undertook the carriage of mails on a system devised by Sir S\u0101l\u0101r Jang I. The ghungru service, or express post, seems also to have been introduced at the same time, but was abolished\nin 1902 because of its cost, since at least two runners had to be kept at every stage.\n\nWhen the State took over the direct management of the department in 1869, District and taluk post offices were immediately established, numbering 125. The net income and expenditure in the first year were Rs. 16,100 and Rs. 2,45,000, respectively. The number of post offices was gradually increased, so that in 1892 they numbered 195, and the receipts and expenditure rose to Rs. 1,27,300 and Rs. 2,60,500 respectively. By 1901 the number of post offices had risen to 239 and the receipts were Rs. 1,57,700, while the expenditure had increased to Rs. 2,99,200. The receipts do not include income from the carriage of service covers, which are carried free of all postal charges. The amount which would have been realized from the conveyance of these during 1901 was estimated at Rs. 3,67,500. In 1901 mails were carried by runners over 3,882 miles of post lines, and by railways over 1,076 miles. The number of persons employed in 1881, 1901, and 1903 was 1,881, 2,177, and 2,140 respectively. The following table gives statistics of the operations of both State and British post offices in 1902-3:\n\n|                                | State post. | British Indian post. |\n|--------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|\n| Number of post offices         | 248         | 38                   |\n| Number of letter-boxes         | 289         | 64                   |\n| Number of miles of postal communication | 4,910       | 1,308                |\n| Total number of postal articles delivered | 6,683,718   | 6,467,973            |\n| Letters                        | 5,612,302   | 3,235,177            |\n| Postcards                      | 1,033,560   | 1,920,735            |\n| Packets (including unregistered newspapers) | ...        | 525,807              |\n| Newspapers (registered as newspapers in the Post Office) | ...        | 734,954              |\n| Parcels                        | 37,856      | 44,400               |\n| Value of stamps sold to the public | Rs. 99,245 | 84,715               |\n| Value of money orders issued   | Rs.         | 43,32,662            |\n| Total amount of savings bank deposits | Rs.        | 9,01,150             |\n\nThe Niz\u0101m's Dominions, in common with other parts of India, are subject to periodical visitations of famine of a more or less severe character. It is recorded that 1629, 1659, and 1685 were famine years, while in the eighteenth century there were famines in 1713, 1747, and 1787. In the nineteenth century famine or scarcity was experienced at eleven periods: namely, 1804, 1813, 1819, 1846, 1854, 1862, 1866, 1871, 1876-7, 1896-7, and 1899-1900. There are no records of famine relief measures prior to 1876. In that year the rains failed, and the Districts affected were Lingsugur, Raichur, Gulbarga, Bh\u012br, and Osman\u0101bad (Naldrug). In the Districts of Nalgonda and Mahb\u016bbnagar (N\u0101gar Karn\u016bl) there was no famine, but the distress caused by scarcity was severe. The whole of the\nState, in fact, suffered, as prices of food rose very high, and famine-stricken people migrated from the affected Districts. Relief works were started in October, 1876, and were finally closed in November, 1877. During this period 6\u00bc million units were provided with work, and 2 millions were relieved in poorhouses. The cost of this famine, excluding remissions of land revenue, was 13\u00bc lakhs. In 1890 the rains again failed in parts of the southern Districts, in which relief was given by opening works and remitting revenue.\n\nA more severe famine appeared imminent in 1896, but was fortunately averted by good rains in November, which saved the standing rabi crops. Although there was no famine, the distress was very severe in some parts, owing to heavy exports of grain to adjoining British famine-stricken territory, and to a local failure of crops. The whole of the Districts of Raichur and Lingsugur, and parts of Gulbarga, Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, and Bh\u012br, comprising an area of 10,278 square miles with a population of 1\u00bd millions, were involved in distress and scarcity. In July, 1897, the affected area increased to 17,835 square miles, with a population of 2,400,000, but a sufficient fall of rain in August averted famine. The total expenditure on relief was 7\u00be lakhs.\n\nThe rainfall received in 1899 was only 15\u00bd inches, or less than half the usual quantity. In the Aurang\u0101b\u0101d and Gulbarga Divisions the later rains failed entirely, and the area affected in 1900 was 23,007 square miles with a population (1891) of 3,573,651. In addition to this, scarcity was felt in an area of 51,541 square miles with a population of 6,512,379. The kharif crop in the famine Districts was estimated at 25 per cent. of the normal, and in the rabi the largest food-crop yielded not more than 12 per cent. The Census of 1901 showed a net decrease of 394,898 persons; and if a normal rate of increase be assumed, the total loss must have been nearly 1\u00bd million persons, in spite of an expenditure on relief of more than two crores. In 1899 the Government of India lent two crores to the State, for expenditure on famine relief.\n\nRaichur, Gulbarga, and Lingsugur are the Districts which are generally the first to suffer from a failure of rains, and are more liable to famine than any other part of the State. Failure of the monsoon rains means the failure of the kharif crops, which provide about half the staple food-grains of the people; and if the late or autumn rains fail, the rabi crops also suffer, which means that besides his linseed and wheat the cultivator loses the whole of the white jow\u0101r, which forms the largest food-grain crop of the State.\n\nThe first indications of famine are a sudden rise in the prices of grain. If the crops fail in the neighbouring Districts or Provinces, there is a sudden influx of immigrants in search of work. Sometimes sufficient grain is produced for the local needs; but if there be famine\noutside the country, grain is largely exported, resulting in high prices. This was actually the case in 1899-1900. The rains failed in 1899, and grain began to be exported largely to the Bombay Presidency, where 90,000 persons were on relief works by November 1, 1899.\n\nThe system of land assessment in the Mar\u0101th\u0101 or 'dry-crop' Districts was based on that of the Bombay Presidency, and no remissions are ordinarily given for a failure of crops. The famine of 1900 so affected the people that special orders were given for extensive remissions in this tract, and the total loss to Government under this head was not less than 45 lakhs. For the Teleng\u0101na Districts extensive irrigation schemes have been prepared, while in Mar\u0101thw\u0101ra the protective measures include the extension and maintenance of roads and the construction of wells. In times of famine food and rations are given to those able to work, and poorhouses are established for the infirm and decrepit. Loans are advanced to the ryots to enable them to purchase cattle, and cheap grain shops are opened for the relief of others.\n\nThe present form of administration was prescribed by the original instructions issued by the Niz\u0101m in the K\u0101nuncha (edict) of 1893, subsequently modified in some respects. According to these, the Mad\u0101r-ul-Mah\u0101m or Minister is the chief controlling authority in the State. To assist him in the work of administration there are four Assistant Ministers: namely, Financial, Judicial, Military, and Miscellaneous, known as Mu\u012bn-ul-Mah\u0101ms. All questions of importance are referred to the Council, which is composed of the Minister as president and the Mu\u012bn-ul-Mah\u0101ms as members. Matters on which there is a difference of opinion between the Minister and an Assistant Minister may also be referred to the Council. Business disposed of by the Council is immediately reported to the Niz\u0101m, and the orders of the Council are carried out without awaiting His Highness's sanction unless he is pleased otherwise to direct.\n\nThe work is distributed as follows: The Financial Assistant Minister has charge of the departments of finance, mint, railways and mines, and stud. The Judicial Assistant Minister has under him the judicial department, jails, registration, medical, post office, and religious institutions. The Military Assistant Minister disposes of the work of the regular and irregular and the Imperial Service troops; and the Miscellaneous Assistant Minister has under him police, public works, education, municipalities, and sanitation. The Revenue department is directly under the Minister, who exercises control over the departments of land revenue, revenue survey and settlement, i\u0101m, customs, excise and \u0101bk\u0101ri, forests, agriculture and commerce, and local funds. The Secretaries are responsible for the work of their departments,\nboth to the Minister and to the Assistant Ministers concerned. The number of Secretaries at present is as follows: (1) financial; (2) two joint for revenue work; (3) judicial, police, and general departments; (4) public works; (5) military secretary; and (6) the private secretary to the Minister. The financial department has charge of the accountant-general's office and the audit branch; and the public works department is under a Secretary with two Superintending Engineers for the Irrigation and the General Branches as executive officers. The other departments are as follows: the judicial, under the High Court, consisting of a Chief Justice and five Puisne Judges; the District police and jails, under an Inspector-General; the city police, under a Kotw\u0101l; customs, under a Commissioner; education, under a Director; stamps and mint, under a Superintendent; forests, under a Conservator; postal, under a Postmaster-General; and the medical, under a Director.\n\nUntil lately the whole State, excluding the Sarf-i-kh\u0101s or Crown District of Atr\u0101f-i-balda, was divided for administrative purposes into four S\u016bbahs or Divisions, 15 Districts, and one Amald\u0101r\u012b or sub-District. In 1905 certain changes were made in the constitution of the Districts; and though the number of S\u016bbahs remains the same, one District (Lingsug\u016br) has been broken up, and the Amald\u0101r\u012b has been made a District, so that there are still 15 Districts. Each S\u016bbah or Division is under a S\u016bbahd\u0101r (Commissioner), and each District under a First T\u0101lukd\u0101r (Collector). The latter officers have two or more assistants, known as Second and Third T\u0101lukd\u0101rs. At the head of each t\u0101luk is a tahsild\u0101r. There are now 101 t\u0101luks, managed by Government, instead of 117 prior to the recent changes. Excluding the Atr\u0101f-i-balda or Crown District, but including all the j\u0101girs and samasth\u0101ns, each of the four S\u016bbahs had an average area of 19,825 square miles and an average population of 2,567,993 in 1901. Exact details of the areas as reconstituted are not available, and the following particulars are based on the statistics of 1901. The average District area and population were 4,956 square miles and 641,998 persons, respectively. These were subdivided into 117 taluks, with an average area of nearly 678 square miles and 87,794 persons. The tahsild\u0101r has charge of the revenue and the magisterial work of his t\u0101luk, with a peshk\u016br (assistant) and a gird\u0101var (revenue inspector) to assist him in his work. The last class of subordinates is found only in the Teleng\u0101na Districts, where remissions are given on 'wet' cultivation in case of excessive or scanty rainfall, or breach of tanks; it being the duty of the revenue inspector to verify and report the extent of the injury thus caused.\n\nThe headman of the village is called p\u0101tel and the village accountant patw\u0101ri, karnam, or kulkarni; there are generally two\np\u0101tels in villages the revenues of which exceed Rs. 500, the m\u0101li or revenue p\u0101tel and the police p\u0101tel. Up to 1870, the p\u0101tels and patw\u0101ris enjoyed in\u0101ms or grants of land in payment of their services; but since that year the in\u0101ms have been resumed and cash payments introduced, the in\u0101m lands, after assessment, remaining in their possession as before.\n\nBesides the ordinary territory of the State, large areas are held as estates, known as samasth\u0101ns or j\u0101girs. The most important samasth\u0101ns are those of Gadw\u0101l, Amarchinta, Wanparti, Jatpol, and Paloncha; the smaller being Gop\u0101lpet, N\u0101r\u0101yanpur, Anegundi, Gurgunta, and the Medak samasth\u0101ns. These are scattered all over the southern half of the Dominions. The largest j\u0101girs are those of Naw\u0101b S\u0101l\u0101r Jang, the three paig\u0101h nobles, Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Sir Kishan Pras\u0101d Bah\u0101dur, Naw\u0101bs His\u0101m-ul-mulk and Fakhr-ul-mulk Bah\u0101dur, Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Sheor\u0101j, and R\u0101j\u0101 Rai Ray\u0101n Bah\u0101dur. The j\u0101girs are dispersed in all parts of the State. Besides these large j\u0101girs, there are numerous smaller ones containing from one village to 60 villages. In 1901 j\u0101girs and samasth\u0101ns covered an area of 24,400 square miles, with a population of 3,259,000. Separate articles explain the constitution of the Paig\u0101h Estates, the S\u0101l\u0101r Jang Estate, and the samasth\u0101ns.\n\nIn 1870 Sir S\u0101l\u0101r Jang I, then Minister, appointed a committee of Muhammadan lawyers to frame laws for the State on the model of those enacted in British India. Later on, the Council of State, composed of the principal nobles, with the Niz\u0101m as president, became a Legislative Council also; and to supplement its labours, and prepare drafts of bills for its consideration, a special committee was nominated. In 1890 a Law Commission, with a president and a secretary, was appointed. The president was required to tour in the State, and lay his notes of inspection before the Commission, to enable it to prepare and submit drafts of laws required, in such form as to admit of their being finally cast into a Code. Reports were to accompany these drafts, explaining the existing laws, the defects observed in their working, and the proposals for removing those defects. The High Court was also directed to submit, for the information of the Commission, the drafts of any laws it might have under consideration, and to communicate any matters for which, in its opinion, new laws or amendments of existing laws were necessary. Other officers also were requested to communicate to the Judicial Secretary their opinions as to any reforms they might consider necessary in existing laws.\n\nHis Highness's attention having been directed to the desirability of establishing a Legislative Council for the purpose of making laws, orders for its establishment were promulgated in 1893. Under these\norders the Council was to consist of the Chief Justice, a Puisne Judge of the High Court, the Inspector-General of Revenue, the Director of Public Instruction, the Inspector-General of Police, and the Financial Secretary. In 1894 Act I of 1304 Fasli received the Niz\u0101m's sanction, recognizing the right of the people to share in the work of framing laws and to representation. In 1900 this Regulation was re-enacted with certain modifications as Act III of 1309 Fasli, and is still in force.\n\nThe Council at present consists of 19 members, of whom, besides the president and vice-president, 11 are official and 6 non-official members. The Minister is the president, and the Assistant Minister, whose department is concerned with a bill before the Council, is vice-president for the time being. Of the 11 official members, the Chief Justice, the Judicial Secretary, and the Legal Adviser are ex-officio members, the remaining 8 official members being nominated by the Minister for two years. Of the 6 non-official members, 2 are elected by the j\u0101gird\u0101rs and landowners, 2 by the pleaders of the High Court, and the remaining 2 are nominated by the Minister from among the residents of the State, of whom one must be nominated from the paig\u0101h il\u0101ka. The non-official members are appointed for two years, but retiring members are eligible for re-election.\n\nTo ensure facilities for ascertaining public opinion, the Council Regulation provides that bills, with the statements of objects and reasons, shall be published in the State Gazette in such language as the Council directs. Bills are based on Muhammadan jurisprudence, the Hindu Sh\u0101stras, special laws binding on a particular community, or customs and usages having the force of law. In addition to these sources, laws in force in British India and elsewhere are consulted.\n\nIn 1304 Fasli (1894) Act I already referred to was passed. In 1305 Fasli (1895) five Acts were passed, Act II being the Gambling Act. In 1307 Fasli (1897) six Acts were passed relating to Oaths, Criminal Tribes, Succession Certificates, Court Fees, Court of Wards, and Labour Contracts. The six Acts passed in the following year dealt with amendments to the District Police and Stamp Rules, General Clauses, Public Demands Recovery, Opium, and Legal Practitioners. Of the thirteen Acts of 1309 Fasli (1899), the Army, the Local Cess, the Game Preservation, the Post Office, the Finger Impressions, the Land Acquisition, the Inventions and Designs, the Forest, and the Counterfeit Coins Acts are the more important. The principal Acts of 1310 Fasli (1900\u20131) were the Census, the Weights and Measures, and the Limitation Acts. In 1903\u20134 the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d Criminal Procedure Code, the Evidence Act, and an Act for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals were passed. The most important of the six Acts passed in 1904\u20135 were amendments to the High Court Regulations and to the Stamps\nAct, the Ferries Act, and an Act for inquiry into the behaviour of public servants.\n\nFor the administration of justice there are 123 civil and 271 criminal courts, including the High Court. Tahsild\u0101rs can try suits up to a limit of Rs. 100, but only seventy-nine tahsild\u0101rs and five naib-tahsild\u0101rs exercise these powers; where Munsifs are appointed, the tahsild\u0101rs have no civil jurisdiction. There are fifteen Munsifs who try suits up to Rs. 500, while the N\u0101zim-i-D\u012bw\u0101ni or District Civil Judge and the Judicial Assistants to the First T\u0101lukd\u0101rs can try suits up to Rs. 5,000, except in the Medak S\u016bbah (Division), where the limit is up to Rs. 10,000. Only five First T\u0101lukd\u0101rs exercise civil powers, and they can try suits without any limit to the amount involved. The N\u0101zim-i-Subah or Divisional Judge tries suits of Rs. 5,000 and upwards. Appeals from the tahsild\u0101rs or Munsifs lie to the N\u0101zim-i-D\u012bw\u0101ni or to the First T\u0101lukd\u0101rs wherever they have civil jurisdiction; and those from the N\u0101zim-i-D\u012bw\u0101ni or First T\u0101lukd\u0101rs lie to the N\u0101zim-i-S\u016bbah. There being no Divisional court in the Medak S\u016bbah (Division), the appeals from the District civil courts lie to the divisional bench of the High Court. In the city of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, the Small Cause Court tries suits up to Rs. 5,000 and hears appeals from the Subordinate Judges of the same court up to Rs. 500. All appeals from the City Small Cause Court and from the N\u0101zim-i-S\u016bbah or Divisional Judge lie to the divisional bench of the High Court. In civil cases up to a value of Rs. 300, in which the District court agrees with the decision of the subordinate court, there is no appeal and the decision is considered final, but revision is permissible on points of law. Similarly in suits up to Rs. 500 decided by the Subordinate Judges of the Small Cause Court, and upheld by the Judge of that court, there is no appeal, but the judgements are subject to revision on the original side of the High Court.\n\nIn criminal cases the tahsild\u0101rs and the Second and Third T\u0101lukd\u0101rs exercise, respectively, third and second-class magisterial powers, and the First T\u0101lukd\u0101rs, being the chief magistrates of the District, are first-class magistrates. Appeals from the tahsild\u0101rs and the subordinate T\u0101lukd\u0101rs lie to the First T\u0101lukd\u0101r, and from his decision to the N\u0101zim-i-S\u016bbah or Divisional Judge. In criminal cases, except trials for murder, if the fines inflicted do not exceed Rs. 500, the decision of the N\u0101zim-i-S\u016bbah is considered final, but revision on points of law is allowed. In all other cases appeals lie to the divisional bench of the High Court, and its decision is final. Appeals from cases in which subordinate magistrates in the city have given sentences not exceeding three months' imprisonment or a fine up to Rs. 100 are heard by the Chief City Magistrate; but appeals from cases in which imprisonment or fine above those limits have been inflicted are heard by the High\nCourt. On its original side the High Court exercises the powers of a Sessions Judge. The divisional bench has power to sentence up to fourteen years, but sentences of imprisonment for life are sent by the High Court to the Minister for confirmation. Sentences of death are submitted to the Niz\u0101m. Many of the holders of large j\u0101girs and samasth\u0101ns exercise judicial powers, both civil and criminal, within their respective domains, and are required to submit periodical returns regarding their judicial work to the Judicial department of the State.\n\nNo extraordinary increase has been observed in civil suits, but in years of famine and scarcity their numbers decrease. On the other hand, criminal cases increase in proportion to the severity of the season. Regular statistics began to be collected in 1885, and judicial reports were prepared from that year. The following tables show what particulars are available:\n\n### Civil Justice\n\n| Classes of suits | Average for six years ending 1890 | Average for ten years ending 1900 | 1901 | 1905 |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------|------|\n| Suits for money and movable property | 12,855 | 12,787 | 11,913 | 11,076 |\n| Title and other suits | 1,535 | 2,441 | 2,280 | 2,436 |\n\n### Criminal Justice\n\n| Number of persons tried: | Average for six years ending 1890 | Average for ten years ending 1900 | 1901 | 1905 |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------|------|\n| (a) For offences against person and property | 7,373 | 6,062 | 6,276 | 6,660 |\n| (b) For other offences against the Indian Penal Code | 36,043 | 31,882 | 29,599 | 16,356 |\n| (c) For offences against special and local laws | 742 | 4,347 | 7,632 | 6,762 |\n\nThe increase in the number of offences against special and local laws is due to the fact that, almost up to the close of 1890, municipal cases were not heard by the criminal courts.\n\nA Registration department was established in 1889, and placed under the High Court, and an Act was passed in the same year to regulate operations. From 1890 to 1895 the department was supervised by the Excise Commissioner, after which it was again made over to the High Court. In 1897 an Inspector-General of Registration and Stamps was appointed, and the department was placed under his charge. In 1899\npaid registrars were appointed in the Districts of Aurangabad, Bhir, Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, Atr\u0101f-i-balda, Raich\u016br, and Gulbarga; but in the other Districts and t\u0101luks revenue and judicial officers were entrusted with the work, who receive a moiety or two-thirds of the fees. The work in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d city is in charge of a city registrar.\n\nIn 1891 there were 18 registrars and 107 sub-registrars, and the number of documents registered was 16,956. The average number of documents registered in the decade ending 1900 was 18,465. In 1901 there were 20 registrars' and 121 sub-registrars' offices, the number of documents registered being 15,826. In 1903 there were 20 registrars' and 122 sub-registrars' offices, and the number of documents registered was 12,033.\n\nThe statistics of revenue and expenditure, shown in Tables V and VI (p. 304) and discussed in this article, do not extend to the Sarf-i-kh\u0101s or Crown lands, the paig\u0101hs and j\u0101girs, which together make up a third of the whole area of the State. Subject to this limitation, the total revenue averaged 327 lakhs between 1881 and 1890, 383 lakhs between 1891 and 1900, and was 417 lakhs in 1901 and 469 lakhs in 1904. The chief source, as usual, is land revenue, which in 1904 yielded 243 lakhs, or 51 per cent. of the total. Customs (56\u00bd lakhs), excise (58 lakhs), and railways (36 lakhs) are also items of considerable importance. The last of these, which entailed a net loss in the twenty years ending 1900, now yield a profit. The rise in revenue, in spite of unfavourable years, points clearly to the improvements which have been made in many branches of the administration.\n\nWhile the revenue has expanded, the expenses of the State have also increased largely, amounting to an average of 316 lakhs between 1881 and 1890, 402 lakhs in the next decade, 411 lakhs in 1901, and 450 lakhs in 1904. Charges in respect of collection include refunds of various classes; part of the salaries of District officers and their establishments, the remainder being debited to law and justice; survey and settlement; the in\u0101m department; payments to village headmen and accountants; dastband or payments for the maintenance of irrigation tanks; and the cost of establishments for collection of customs and forest dues, excise and opium fees, manufacture and vend of stamps, and registration. These charges amounted to 56 lakhs in 1904.\n\nThe item 'general administration' includes the salaries of the Minister and the Assistant Ministers, the cost of establishments in all the head-quarter offices, and the pay and establishment charges of the four S\u016bbahd\u0101rs. A considerable increase has been made in the allotments for law and justice (including jails), police, education, and medical charges. The expenditure on pensions includes a variety\nof charges, most of which are decreasing, though the head 'service pensions' is responsible for an increase, due to the improvement in the position of officials of the State. The miscellaneous charges include expenditure on famine relief, and have thus risen largely. The loan of two crores, already referred to, together with interest at 4 per cent., is being gradually paid off, partly from the State balances and partly by appropriation of a portion of the rent paid by the British Government for Berar.\n\nThe current coin of the State is known as the H\u0101li sikka, and the quantity in circulation has been reckoned at about 10 crores. The issue of the H\u0101li sikka began in 1854, when the first Sir Salar Jang was Minister, and has continued with occasional interruptions. Free coinage was allowed in the mint up to 1893, but after that date comparatively little silver was coined. The stock of rupees in circulation became somewhat depleted; and the rate of exchange between the State rupee and the British rupee, after fluctuating violently in 1901 and 1902, has since remained fairly steady, the former exchanging at about 8 per cent. above its bullion value. In 1904 an improved coin of a new design was minted, known as the Mahbubia rupee, representing on one side the famous Char Minar building, which stands in the centre of Hyderabad city; since this new rupee was issued, the supply has been regulated so as to prevent serious fluctuations of exchange value. The rate now stands at between 115 and 116 to 100 British rupees. The copper coins issued by the State were till recently oblong pieces of about 2 pies in value. Since 1905, however, copper coins of a better pattern have been issued from the Hyderabad mint, representing the same value. Half-anna coins are also being made. The old coins are still in use, and will remain in circulation until a sufficient quantity of the new coins has been produced.\n\nThe common system of land tenure throughout the State is ryotwari. All the nine Districts of Marathwara and four of the Telengana Districts have been surveyed and settled according to this system; they are Aurangabad, Bhur, Nander, Parbhani, Gulbarga, Osmanabad, Raichur, Lingsugur, Bidar, Nizamabad (Indur), Medak, Mahbubnagar, and Warangal. Of the remaining four Districts, Karimnagar (Elgandal) and Nalgonda have been surveyed and partly assessed. Adilabad (Sirpur Tandur) and the Crown District of Atraf-i-balda have not yet been surveyed. In the earlier settlements the period of settlement was for thirty years, while those surveyed later were settled for fifteen years. Revision work has been commenced in some of the latter class, where the terms have expired or are about to expire.\n\nUnder the ryotwari system each field is considered a holding, which\nthe ryot holds directly from the State, and the holder or occupant of the field is called the pattadar. The right of occupancy depends on the regular payment of the assessment by the pattadar, and in case of failure to meet the demand he forfeits his right. In such a case the land reverts to the State, and the right of occupancy is sold by auction to satisfy the demand for arrears. The period of holding is nominally one year, but if the holder pays the assessment and dues regularly, he may retain his land indefinitely. A pattadar may relinquish his land by giving due notice of his intention, or he may sell or transfer his right if he chooses to do so. Reference has already been made, in dealing with rents, to the practice of subletting or taking partners (shikmidars).\n\nThe other systems of tenure are known as jagir, inam, makta or sarbasta, peshkash, agarh\u0101r, and ij\u0101ra. A jagir is a free grant of one or more villages, and the tenure may be classed under four heads: al-tamgh\u0101 or in\u0101m-al-tamgh\u0101, which are grants of an hereditary or permanent nature; s\u0101t jagirs, or personal grants for the maintenance of the grantees; paigah jagirs, or grants to the nobles of the State for maintaining troops for the Niz\u0101m; tankhw\u0101hi-i-mahall\u0101t, or grants in lieu of certain local payments that were binding on the State. The inam lands are granted for service or charitable purposes, either free of revenue or subject to a quit rent. Makta or sarbasta resembles the jagir tenure, except that the holder has to pay a certain fixed proportion of the revenue to the State; it is also known as p\u0101lampat in the Mar\u0101th\u0101 Districts. Under the peshkash tenure villages are granted on a fixed assessment, like the zam\u012bnd\u0101ri tenure in Northern India; all the samasth\u0101ns in the State are held under this tenure. Agarh\u0101r is a free grant of one or more villages for the upkeep of Hindu temples. Ij\u0101ra is a lease granted for a whole waste village for a term of thirty or forty years. The ij\u0101rad\u0101r or lessee pays no rent for the first three or five years; after that he begins to pay a fraction of the full assessment, varying from one-tenth to one-fifth, and increased every year till the full assessment is reached, which is paid till the lease expires.\n\nIn 1901 there were 13,039 ryotw\u0101ri, 2,904 jagir, 664 makta or sarbasta, 681 peshkash, 415 ij\u0101ra, 309 agarh\u0101r, and 1,006 deserted villages in the State; and the revenue derived from the ryotw\u0101ri, makta, and peshkash villages was 191 lakhs, 6.7 lakhs, and 139 lakhs respectively.\n\nThe assessment was originally based on the quantity of grain sown in a field or on its produce, of which a certain share was taken by the State as revenue. On \u2018dry crops\u2019 the share was about one-fourth of the produce, and on \u2018wet\u2019 lands, irrigated from tanks and wells, the State received half and two-fifths respectively of the produce. When\npayment in kind was commuted to cash payment, the amount thus fixed became the revenue of the field. A t\u0101l\u016bk, after it has been surveyed, is divided into groups of villages for the purpose of classification and assessment. The fertility and depth of the soil, the absence or presence of sand, limestone nodules, saline efflorescences and other defects in it, proximity of the group to, or its distance from, centres of trade or railways, and easy means of communication are all factors which are considered in determining the assessment. A standard maximum rate per acre is fixed for the group, and varying rates to be applied to all land in the group are calculated on the basis of its advantages or defects.\n\nNo records exist to show what the revenue demand was in early times, but the revenues under Musalm\u0101n rule seem to have been generally farmed out. Traces of settlements made by the Bahmani kings and by the Adil Sh\u0101hi and Kutb Sh\u0101hi rulers have been found in some of the Districts; but it was not until Akbar\u2019s annexation of Ber\u0101r in 1596, and Malik Ambar\u2019s rule in Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, that regular settlements were introduced. The S\u016bbah of Ber\u0101r under the Mughals was more extensive than it is now, as it included portions of Sirpur T\u0101nd\u016br, Elgandal, Ind\u016br, N\u0101nder, Parbhani, and Aurang\u0101b\u0101d Districts, which now fall within the boundaries of the Niz\u0101m\u2019s Dominions. Under Akbar\u2019s famous settlement, the assessment was fixed by measuring the arable lands, and making a careful estimate of the produce. Each b\u012bgha was then rated at one-fourth the estimated produce, and the total demand on a village was termed its tankhw\u0101h or standard rent-roll. In 1600 the province was assessed at 161 lakhs, and during the time of the first Niz\u0101m at 120 lakhs.\n\nTeleng\u0101na during the reign of Abul Hasan, the last of the Golconda kings, yielded a total revenue of 166 lakhs, but the boundaries of the Golconda kingdom then extended as far as the sea-coast, including the Northern Circ\u0101rs. It has been estimated that the present revenue is about equal to the cash assessments at the beginning of the seventeenth century. During the eighteenth century the State suffered from the inroads of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s; and when order was restored, the revenues of the State were farmed out to bankers and to Arab and Path\u0101n soldiers, who extorted as much money as they could from the cultivators. The farming system was abolished by Sir S\u0101l\u0101r Jang immediately after his appointment as Minister, and from that date the prosperity of the people has increased.\n\nThe average area of a holding in the whole State is $28\\frac{2}{3}$ acres, varying from $28\\frac{1}{2}$ acres in Mar\u0101thw\u0101ra to $12\\frac{1}{2}$ acres in Teleng\u0101na. In the Mar\u0101th\u0101 Districts the Government assessment on \u2018dry\u2019 lands ranges from Rs. 3\u20130\u20131 to R. 0\u201310\u20132 per acre, the average being R. 0\u201312\u20139, while for \u2018wet\u2019 and b\u0101gh\u016bl (garden) lands the average is\nRs. 4-5-6 per acre, the maximum being Rs. 15-0-0 and the minimum Rs. 1-2-0. In the Teleng\u0101na Districts the average assessment on 'dry' lands is R. 0-13-5 (maximum Rs. 4-0-0, minimum R. 0-1-0), and on 'wet' lands Rs. 9-4-2, the maximum and minimum being Rs. 24-0-0 and Rs. 3-0-0 respectively. The average rate per acre for the whole State is Rs. 1-3-8, but for Mar\u0101thw\u0101ra and Teleng\u0101na it is R. 0-14-3 and Rs. 1-13-10 respectively, the high rate of assessment and the smallness of holdings in Teleng\u0101na being due to the prevalence of 'wet' cultivation. No reliable figures are available to show the gross produce, and it is impossible to say what proportion the land revenue demand bears to it. No difficulty is experienced in collecting the revenue, and there is very little resort to coercive measures. The general principle of assessment is to take half the net profits, after paying cost of cultivation, &c., as the State share.\n\nIn times of scarcity or famine, the demand is suspended and recovered in the following year; and remissions are also granted when distress is severe or when the ryot has lost his cattle. In Mar\u0101thw\u0101ra and in the settled Teleng\u0101na Districts, remissions are not granted for 'dry' land, as the assessment is very light. But in the unsettled Teleng\u0101na Districts, remissions are given on 'dry' lands affected by bad seasons, including excessive rain; and on 'wet' lands for want of water, including breach of tanks and decay of wells. These remissions are granted in ordinary years. Remissions are also given for 'wet' lands in settled Districts when the water-supply fails.\n\nIn the settled Districts the ordinary rates of assessment apply to the whole extent of the holding: but in the unsettled Districts only the cultivated area of a holding is assessed, and the revenue of the uncultivated portion is remitted on both 'wet' and 'dry' lands. Special rules have been made for encouraging ryots to plant mango groves, and land is given at 10 annas per acre for this purpose.\n\nThe ryot is free to transfer or sell his right of occupancy, and in this way much land has been acquired by professional money-lenders in the Mar\u0101th\u0101 Districts. The Teleng\u0101na ryot is just beginning to realize the value of occupancy rights.\n\nUnder Miscellaneous Revenue are included opium and drugs, customs, excise, and stamps.\n\nMiscellaneous revenue.\n\nIn accordance with the terms of an agreement made with the Government of India, the cultivation of poppy was prohibited in 1881, and all opium for consumption has since been imported from M\u0101lw\u0101 under passes issued by the Opium Agent. The duty levied amounts to Rs. 15 per seer, of which Rs. 10 is paid on issue of the pass and the balance on the arrival of the opium. Contracts for the monopoly of retail vend are sold in each District and\nin the city circle. The right to sell hemp drugs (ganja and bhang) is also sold by auction.\n\nThe number of chests of opium, containing 70 seers each, imported in 1901 was 249. The gross value of the opium imported in 1881\u201390, 1891\u20131900 (averages), and 1901 was Rs. 2,49,630, Rs. 1,60,898, and Rs. 1,86,830 respectively. The net revenue realized from opium and hemp drugs since 1882 is given in the following table:\n\n|                      | Average, 1882\u201390 | Average, 1891\u20131900 | 1901 | 1903 |\n|----------------------|------------------|--------------------|------|------|\n| Opium                | Rs. 2,19,730     | Rs. 3,15,232       | Rs. 4,25,590 | Rs. 5,16,001 |\n| Ganja and bhang and other intoxicating drugs | ... | ... | Rs. 64,328 | Rs. 74,949 |\n| Total                | Rs. 2,19,730     | Rs. 3,15,232       | Rs. 4,89,918 | Rs. 5,90,950 |\n\nCustoms duty is levied on imports and exports at the rate of 5 per cent. ad valorem, which is the maximum fixed by treaty with the Government of India. British gold, silver, and copper coins, vegetables, certain seeds, wool, books and maps, building stone (except Sh\u00e2h\u00e2b\u00e2d stone), dry and green grass, and firewood are all exempt from both export and import duty. Since 1885 the duty on bar silver has been raised to 10 per cent., to check its import for illicit coinage. Salt is imported from Bombay and Masulipatam by railway, and a duty of Rs. 2 per palla or three maunds (120 seers) is collected by the Customs department. The total quantity of salt imported and consumed in 1881\u201390, 1891\u20131900 (averages), and 1901 was 41,840, 43,910, and 46,810 tons respectively; and the consumption per head in 1881, 1891, and 1901 was 9\u00bd, 8\u00bd, and 9\u00bd lb.\n\nThe following table shows the customs receipts for 1901 and 1903, including the duty on salt:\n\n|                      | 1901          | 1903          |\n|----------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Import duties        | Rs. 18,07,528 | Rs. 19,43,324 |\n| Export duties        | Rs. 25,32,100 | Rs. 28,13,552 |\n| Octroi               | Rs. 1,92,372  | Rs. 2,39,719  |\n| Salt                 | Rs. 8,73,782  | Rs. 8,59,760  |\n| Duties on wines and spirits | Rs. 37,523 | Rs. 17,276 |\n| Miscellaneous        | Rs. 20,437    | Rs. 24,192    |\n| **Total**            | Rs. 54,63,742 | Rs. 58,97,823 |\n\n* This duty is levied at Hyder\u00e2b\u00e2d, Secunder\u00e2b\u00e2d, and Bolarum on produce and manufactures of the State brought into these towns, the tariff being the same as for Customs duty.\n\nThe excise revenue is farmed at auction, by contracts for periods ranging from three to ten years. The chief sources of income are\ncountry spirits, toddy, and mahua flowers. In the Districts country spirits are manufactured in out-stills, and there is no restriction as to the quantity or strength of liquor. At Secunderabad there is a State distillery. Contracts for drawing and selling of toddy are sold by taluks in the Districts, while in the city circle, including Secunderabad and Bolaram, similar arrangements are made, besides which a nazaruna is levied on toddy shops, and a duty of 4 annas per pot of 20 seers. The duty on mahua flowers is Rs. 16 per palla or 3 maunds.\n\nThe total receipts from excise for 1901 and 1903 are shown in the following table:\n\n|                  | 1901     | 1903     |\n|------------------|----------|----------|\n| Country liquor   | Rs. 6,375,992 | Rs. 10,837,730 |\n| Toddy            | Rs. 19,013,666 | Rs. 18,433,855 |\n| Mahua flowers    | Rs. 7,102,511  | Rs. 9,708,041  |\n| Secunderabad contract | Rs. 4,19,000 | Rs. 4,60,000 |\n| **Total**        | Rs. 37,28,209 | Rs. 43,57,889 |\n\nLicences are granted for the sale of European liquor on payment of Rs. 30 a month. A private distillery has been licensed at Chadarghat for the manufacture of rum after European methods from raw sugar and treacle.\n\nToddy is largely consumed in the Telengana Districts, where the two kinds of toddy-palm (Borassus flabellifer and Phoenix sylvestris) are cultivated. In the Maratha Districts the palm is rare, and the people use mahua liquor to a much greater extent. There is a growing taste for European liquor in the city and suburbs and some of the District head-quarters. No special efforts have been made to restrict the consumption of intoxicants, though their increased cost, owing to better methods of administration, has had some effect. The incidence of excise revenue per head of population for the years 1901 and 1903 was respectively R. 0-5-7 and R. 0-6-3.\n\nPostage and other stamps, postcards, embossed envelopes, and stamp paper are all made at the Hyderabad Stamp Office. A discount of 5 per cent. is given to the vendors of all kinds of stamps. Until recently all the stamp paper used in Berar was also supplied from the Hyderabad Stamp Office, but since 1902 this has been discontinued. Most of the large jagirdars who have their own courts are supplied with stamp paper at 25 per cent. of the full value of the stamp. Up to 1892 there were separate judicial and non-judicial stamps, but since that year all the stamps have been marked 'revenue.' Bad seasons affect the sale of stamps in a marked degree. The table on the next page shows the net revenue derived from the sale of stamps since 1881.\nIn 1887 a cess of one anna per rupee of land revenue was imposed. It was at first levied only in settled Districts, but was subsequently introduced into Warangal District, in anticipation of settlement. An Act was passed in 1899 to legalize the levy of other cesses, such as lighting and cart and carriage tax; but these cesses have not yet been imposed. The Local Board department was first created in 1887, and was placed under a Central board at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, composed of high officials. This Sadr or Central board was, however, abolished in 1894, and the Subahd\u0101rs were empowered to sanction works up to Rs. 5,000, the general control being vested in the then Revenue Board, with powers to sanction up to Rs. 10,000, while estimates exceeding that amount were referred to the Minister.\n\nIn 1901 there were 13 District and 70 t\u0101luk boards, consisting of 182 and 560 members respectively. The District board generally has the First T\u0101lukd\u0101r as president and thirteen members, of whom seven are non-officials, selected from among the zamind\u0101rs, respectable tradesmen, and vakils: the official members, besides the president, being the revenue assistant at head-quarters, the District Engineer, the Superintendent of police, the District medical officer, the tahsild\u0101r at head-quarters, and the head schoolmaster. The t\u0101luk boards are subordinate to the District board, and are composed of two official members, the Second or Third T\u0101lukd\u0101r in charge of the t\u0101luk and the tahsild\u0101r, and three non-official members. The t\u0101luk boards control the expenditure on work connected with their t\u0101luks and sanctioned by the District board, and keep detailed accounts of such expenditure. The District boards have power to sanction works up to Rs. 2,000.\n\nThe local cess provides funds for the construction and maintenance of roads, schools, dispensaries, resthouses, and other works calculated to benefit the inhabitants of the District. It is collected with each instalment of revenue paid by the cultivators and is credited in the\naccounts as follows: village police fund, 4 pies; educational fund, 2 pies; road fund, 2 pies; medical, 1 pie; and general improvement fund, 3 pies. The village police fund is credited to the State which meets the cost of the village police, and the educational fund is controlled by the Educational department.\n\nThe works undertaken by these boards, since they have been in effective existence, have been of the following classes: repairs to local roads at the head-quarter towns, construction of roads to taluk headquarters, bridges, causeways, approaches to ferries, dispensaries, chauris, rest-houses, dharmas\u016blas, sarats, markets, drinking wells and gardens, expenditure on municipal conservancy, lighting, sanitation, town police, and local board schools. Vaccination and cattle disease have also received attention. During famines numbers of new wells were dug and old wells cleaned and repaired. In fact, all local works are entrusted to the boards which are likely to promote the general health and convenience of the people. All these works are carried out by the local board engineers and are not in charge of Public Works officers.\n\nThe following table shows the income of the boards:\n\n|                     | Average, 1891-1900 | 1901 | 1903 |\n|---------------------|--------------------|------|------|\n| Provincial rates    | Rs. 40,864         | Rs. 40,093 | Rs. 42,020 |\n| Interest            | ...                | Rs. 549   | Rs. 108  |\n| Education           | Rs. 1,428,688      | Rs. 1,36,620 | Rs. 1,96,117 |\n| Medical             | Rs. 36,506         | Rs. 68,154 | Rs. 98,064 |\n| Miscellaneous       | Rs. 3,68,535       | Rs. 5,20,291 | Rs. 5,47,333 |\n| Public works        | Rs. 3,87,493       | Rs. 3,77,670 | Rs. 4,97,405 |\n| Ferries             | Rs. 23,791         | Rs. 27,309 | Rs. 22,470 |\n| **Total**           | Rs. 10,00,027      | Rs. 11,70,686 | Rs. 14,04,477 |\n\n'Provincial rates' here means toll tax and fees collected at fairs and places of pilgrimage. Under 'miscellaneous' are included refunds, fines, school fees, income from public gardens, district municipalities, and deposits. 'Education' and 'medical' represent the two pies and one pie set apart from the local cess for these purposes.\n\nThe following table shows the expenditure:\n\n|                     | Average, 1891-1900 | 1901 | 1903 |\n|---------------------|--------------------|------|------|\n| Education           | Rs. 1,70,868       | Rs. 93,592 | Rs. 1,73,501 |\n| Medical             | Rs. 6,478          | Rs. 43,877 | Rs. 67,023 |\n| Miscellaneous       | Rs. 3,10,852       | Rs. 2,51,685 | Rs. 7,22,519 |\n| Public works        | Rs. 4,17,758       | Rs. 3,92,151 | Rs. 4,41,357 |\n| **Total**           | Rs. 9,05,956       | Rs. 7,31,305 | Rs. 14,04,400 |\nThe tables of income and expenditure refer to the whole State, except the Districts of Karimnagar (Elgandal), Nalgonda, Adilabad (Sirpur Tandur) and the Crown District of Atrafi-balda. The allotments for education and medical are both spent through the General departmental Secretary on the establishments of the educational department, the normal school, and the secretariat, and the travelling expenses of the inspectors of schools, house rent, scholarships, prizes, and repairs to buildings, and in the medical department for allowances to establishments and vaccinators. Under 'miscellaneous' are included the pay of the police, the patels' salaries, health officers' allowance, the upkeep of public gardens, the planting of roadside trees, &c.\n\nMunicipal administration was first introduced in Hyderab\u0101d in 1869, when the city proper was divided into four, and the suburbs into five, divisions for municipal purposes, the whole management being placed under a municipal superintendent. In 1881 the suburban area was handed over to a separate officer, both the officers being thenceforward designated secretaries to the two municipalities of Hyderab\u0101d city and Ch\u0101dargh\u0101t. In 1903 the two municipalities were again amalgamated and placed under a special officer, styled the secretary to the committee. The members of the committee are called municipal commissioners and number twenty-seven. The president and some of the members are officials, the remainder being selected from the vakils of the High Court, bankers, representatives of the Sarf-i-kh\u0101s and paig\u0101h departments, and other persons not in State service.\n\nSanitation and conservancy were also provided for in the Divisional, District, and t\u0101luk head-quarters; but regular arrangements and the appointment of committees were effected only after the establishment of local boards and the levy of the one-anna cess, from which municipal expenditure is met, as well as that of the District and local boards. The members of the local boards are also members of the municipal committees at the Divisional and District head-quarters. Excluding the city, there were 21 municipalities in the State in 1901. In 14 of these the population ranged from 10,000 to 37,000, and in the remaining 7 from 4,800 to nearly 10,000. They comprise the Divisional and District head-quarter towns, and a few of the t\u0101luk head-quarters.\n\nThe incidence of taxation per head of population in the city and Ch\u0101dargh\u0101t municipalities in 1901 was R. 0\u20138\u20132 and R. 0\u20137\u20138 respectively, the chief items of receipt being hackney carriage licences, bazars, slaughter-houses, rents, and house tax. The latter is levied at the rate of 3 per cent. on the annual rent. A water tax has been levied in the city since 1897, and in Ch\u0101dargh\u0101t since 1896. Among\nthe results of municipal administration may be mentioned the widening of narrow streets and lanes, the construction of sewers and drains, and the supply of pure filtered water to the city from the Mir Akam tank, and to Ch\u0101dargh\u0101t from the Husain S\u0101gar tank.\n\nThe Public Works department was first organized in 1868, when a Chief Engineer, with a staff of assistants, was appointed, and a code was compiled for their guidance. The Chief Engineer exercised a general control over the department, and audited the entire expenditure. The Dominions were divided into fourteen districts, each under a district engineer. In 1869 a departmental Minister was appointed to work under the Minister, the Chief Engineer being secretary in the department. In 1875 the department was reorganized into two distinct branches, administrative and executive, the immediate head of the former being the Minister, and that of the latter the departmental Minister, styled the Sadr-ul-Mah\u0101m, while a secretary was appointed for each branch. The Municipal and Irrigation departments remained separate, and had not shown much progress, but were amalgamated with the Public Works department in 1884-5, the latter being separated from the Buildings and Roads branch in 1887. Subsequently the designation of the Sadr-ul-Mah\u0101m was changed to that of Muin-ul-Mah\u0101m, who became head of both the branches of control and executive, and was made an Assistant to the Minister. In 1894, owing to the increase in the volume of work, the office of secretary in the Public Works department was separated from that of the Chief Engineer, and business connected with railways and mines, municipalities, and telephones was entrusted to the charge of the former. Since 1901, cases connected with railways and mines have been dealt with by the secretary in the Financial department.\n\nOther changes have been made in the administration of the department, which at present is organized as follows: At the head is an Assistant Minister, styled the Muin-ul-Mah\u0101m. Under him is a secretary, who holds charge of the administrative section divided into two branches known as the Irrigation and the General branches, the latter including buildings, roads, water-works, municipalities, and telephones. A Superintending Engineer holds executive and partial administrative charge of the Irrigation branch, and a Superintending Engineer is at the head of the General branch. These two officers, the secretary to the municipal committee, and the superintendents of the public gardens and telephone departments are all under the secretary.\n\nWork in the Districts is supervised by the District Engineers, who are in charge of the construction and repairs of civil buildings and roads. At present 1,614 miles of roads are maintained by the depart-\nment at an annual expenditure of about $5\\frac{1}{2}$ lakhs, while others are in course of construction.\n\nThe more important works executed during the past few years include the African cavalry guard lines, commanding officer's quarters at S\u016br\u0101pur, military lines at Naldrug, an armouy and general hospital at Golconda, bandsmen's lines at Ch\u0101dargh\u0101t, the palace at Sur\u016brnagar, the Malakpet State stables, the thag\u012b jail, police barracks, Government House and the Commissioner's court at Hanamkonda, revenue survey offices at Raich\u016br, Gulbarga, and Hanamkonda, Central jails at Aurang\u0101bad, Gulbarga, and Warangal, and jails at N\u0101nder and Medak, a clock-tower and medical storeroom at Hyder\u0101bad, dispensaries at N\u0101nder, W\u0101di, Bhong\u012br, Nalgonda, Niz\u0101m\u0101bad, Makhtal, Hingoli, and Y\u0101dgir, the Race Stand, the Public Works office, and the Afzal Ganj hospital at Hyder\u0101bad. The roads constructed have already been referred to. Important bridges have been made in Gulbarga District and over part of the Husain S\u0101gar tank.\n\nAt Hyder\u0101bad the Murkinalla drain has been diverted and improved, the Afzal S\u0101gar and Sh\u0101h Ganj drains have been constructed, and a channel made from the public gardens to the Gosha Mahal kunta. Hyder\u0101bad (with Ch\u0101dargh\u0101t), Aurang\u0101bad, and Niz\u0101m\u0101bad are the only towns at present provided with regular systems of water-supply, executed under the supervision and control of the department. Those at Hyder\u0101bad and Aurang\u0101bad were constructed, and are maintained, at the cost of the State, while the Niz\u0101m\u0101bad supply was paid for by the R\u0101n\u012b of Sirnapalli but is maintained from Local funds.\n\nA telephone department was formed in 1884. It was organized by the Bombay Telephone Company and worked by them for eight months, after which period it was taken over by the State. The principal nobles of the State, wealthy private individuals, and all important officials are subscribers to the system. The annual upkeep costs Rs. 15,000, and the fees collected from the non-official class of subscribers amount to Rs. 10,000. The total number of offices and dwelling-houses to which wires are laid is 154, including 71 State instalments.\n\nThe Irrigation and the General branches of the Public Works department were separated in 1888, the former dealing with irrigation works only. In 1896, when it was found that the larger tanks required not only extensive repairs but restoration also, it was considered expedient to form a separate Irrigation department under a Chief Engineer, whose services had been lent to the State by the Government of India. The Irrigation board was abolished, and the posts of Superintending and Divisional Engineers were also dispensed with, the Chief Engineer submitting his proposals, &c., relating to irrigation works to Government through the Public Works secretary.\nUnder the Chief Engineer are seven Irrigation engineers, one for each District, with an adequate subordinate staff and establishment, who are responsible for the maintenance of all irrigation works in their respective Districts. The designation of Chief Engineer was again changed to that of Superintending Engineer towards the close of 1903.\n\nThe operations of the Irrigation department are practically confined to the Teleng\u0101na and Carnatic Districts. The Mar\u0101th\u0101 Districts are now being surveyed, to ascertain suitable sites for extensive storage works, so as to ensure a supply of water in all years, as well as to afford useful employment to labourers in those Districts.\n\nThe irrigation works completed during the three years 1901-3 were of three distinct classes: (a) original works, including reconstruction of abandoned works; (b) restoration of recently damaged works; and (c) extensions and improvements. The amount spent on class (a) during the three years was 48.7 lakhs, on class (b) 60.4 lakhs, and on class (c) 89.5 lakhs, the aggregate being 199 lakhs. The increase of revenue derived from these was 1.2 lakhs, 5.8 lakhs, and 3.2 lakhs respectively, the total increase of revenue thus exceeding 10 lakhs, or 5 per cent. on the capital outlay.\n\nThe total expenditure on public works rose from an average of 18 lakhs in the decade 1881-90 to 23 lakhs in the next decade, and was 31.2 lakhs in 1900-1 and 36.2 lakhs in 1903. Since 1895 the expenditure on each branch has been separately recorded. That of the General branch decreased from 18.3 lakhs in 1895 to 14.4 lakhs in 1901, while the cost of irrigation works rose from 7 lakhs to 16.3 lakhs.\n\nThe total strength of the State army in 1901 was 24,012, classed as regular (6,481) or irregular (17,531). The regular troops consist of three regiments of cavalry (915 strong), two regiments of Imperial Service cavalry (806), three batteries of artillery (360), and six regiments of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d infantry (4,400). Small detachments of the infantry regiments are stationed at Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, Gulbarga, Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d, and Warangal, to guard the jails at those places. Strong detachments from the cavalry regiments have latterly been posted at Amba (Momin\u0101b\u0101d) and Hingoli since their vacation by the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d Contingent. The irregular troops consist of 2,679 horse and 14,852 foot. Of these, 3,132 infantry and 1,355 cavalry are stationed at various posts to guard the jails, while the cavalry also escort the British and Niz\u0101m\u2019s posts. A small Volunteer Corps, called \u2018His Highness the Niz\u0101m\u2019s Own Mounted Volunteers,\u2019 numbers 120. In 1903 the total strength of the army was 24,035, the regulars and irregulars being 6,535 and 17,500 respectively. The expenditure on the army averaged 68.8 lakhs between 1881 and 1890, 69.4 lakhs in the next decade, and was 63.9 lakhs in 1901 and 63.7 lakhs in 1904.\n\nThe total strength of the British army stationed within the State in\n1903 consisted of 2,988 European and 5,549 Native troops. Hyder\u0101b\u0101d is partly in the Secunder\u0101b\u0101d division, which is for the present directly under the Commander-in-Chief, and partly in the Poona division of the Western Command. The military stations at present are Bol\u0101rum and Secunder\u0101b\u0101d in the former, and Aurang\u0101b\u0101d in the latter. The headquarters of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d Volunteer Rifles are at Secunder\u0101b\u0101d, and detachments of the Ber\u0101r Volunteer Rifles and Great Indian Peninsula Railway Volunteer Rifles are also located within the State. The total strength of these in 1903 was 1,278.\n\nPrior to the ministry of the late Sir S\u0101l\u0101r Jang, there was no organized police in the State, and the arrangements made in the different Divisions depended to a great extent on the revenue officials. In 1866, when Districts were first formed, a regular police force was also raised and placed under the revenue authorities, but the system did not work satisfactorily. In 1869 a special Sadr-ul-Mah\u0101m or Police Minister was appointed, with full powers over the police. A year later Sadr Mohtamims were appointed, one for each Division; but their appointments were abolished in 1884, and an Inspector-General of District Police was appointed, the designation of Sadr-ul-Mah\u0101m being changed to Muin-ul-Mah\u0101m or Assistant Minister, Police department. The District police were placed under the First T\u0101lukd\u0101r, and the District Police Superintendent was made his executive deputy. Subsequently a detective branch was organized, under an officer deputed from the Ber\u0101r force. Besides the city police, which is quite separate from that of the District police, there are three distinct police jurisdictions in the State: the Sarf-i-kh\u0101s, the D\u012bw\u0101ni or Kh\u0101lsa, and the paig\u0101h and j\u0101gir police.\n\nThe supervising staff consists of an Inspector-General, 5 Assistants, 17 Mohtamims or Superintendents, 17 Assistant Superintendents, and 119 Amins or inspectors; while the subordinate force comprises foot and mounted police, numbering 11,173 and 413 respectively. In addition to the regular force, the rural police are under the revenue officers or T\u0101lukd\u0101rs, and have scarcely any connexion with the District police. They include 12,776 police p\u0101tels, 2,798 kotw\u0101ls, and 17,532 r\u0101mosis or watchmen, numbering altogether 33,106. The table on the next page gives statistics of number and pay in 1901 and 1903.\n\nThe strength of the regular force is equivalent to one policeman to every 990 persons in the D\u012bw\u0101ni and to 609 in the Sarf-i-kh\u0101s, while there is one policeman to 7\u00b71 and 4\u00b73 square miles in these areas.\n\nRecruits are medically examined as to their physical fitness, and their character is verified. The maximum age of recruits is 25, and their minimum height 5 feet 5 inches. The recruit on enlistment\nundergoes a year's course of training at District head quarters in law and procedure, drill, gymnastics, signalling, &c. Educated natives are averse to police service, owing to the low scale of pay offered. The detective branch is under a selected officer, who has an assistant and a staff of amins, jemadars, daffadars, and constables working under him. This branch has done excellent service in arresting a large number of notorious dacoits and other criminals. A system of identification by means of finger-prints was introduced in 1898, and has been successful. The District police are armed with muzzle-loaders of an old and inferior type, but the officers are provided with swords and pistols. No special military police force is maintained in the State.\n\n| Particulars       | 1901          | 1903          |\n|-------------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                   | Number        | Pay           | Number        | Pay           |\n| Diwan\u012b            |               | Rs.           |               | Rs.           |\n| Supervising staff | 142           | 2,03,460      | 139           | 2,00,580      |\n| Subordinate staff | 40,008        | 18,95,850     | 38,293        | 19,41,990     |\n| Sarf-i-kh\u0101s       |               |               |               |               |\n| Supervising staff | 17            | 22,260        | 20            | 26,520        |\n| Subordinate staff | 4,684         | 1,99,155      | 6,265         | 3,05,013      |\n| Total             | 44,851        | 23,20,725     | 44,717        | 24,74,103     |\n\nThe city police is quite distinct from the District police and is under a Commissioner, known as the Kotw\u0101l, who exercises control within the municipal area. The total strength of this force is about 3,000, including 50 mounted men and nearly 100 Arabs; and the cost was 4.4 lakhs in 1901.\n\nThe railway police is a distinct corps and has no connexion with the District police. In 1871 through traffic was established between Bombay and Madras, necessitating the employment of 117 officers and men. This force has been gradually increased as new lines were opened, and in 1903 consisted of 520 men and officers under a Superintendent, the proportion being one man to every 1.6 miles of railway. A small body of specially selected men are employed as detectives, and travel in all passenger trains, and have been instrumental in bringing professional thieves to justice. There are 8 lock-ups in charge of the railway police, but prisoners are sent to the Secunder\u0101b\u0101d jail to serve their term.\n\nThe table on the next page gives the results of cases dealt with by the Diwan\u012b, Sarf-i-kh\u0101s, and railway police.\n\nThe administration of jails is in charge of the Inspector-General of Police, who is also the Inspector-General of Prisons. Each of the outlying Central jails is in charge of a Superintendent, controlled by\nthe First T\u0101lukd\u0101r in his capacity of Nazim-i-Mah\u0101bis or Inspector of jails. The Third T\u0101lukd\u0101rs or head-quarters tahsild\u0101rs supervise District jails. The Central jail at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d is also in charge of a Superintendent, who is directly subordinate to the Inspector-General of Prisons. Central jails are maintained at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, Gulbarga, Warangal, and Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d, and District jails at the headquarters of other Districts. Lock-ups or subsidiary jails are located in some of the t\u0101luk offices. The average jail mortality in 1891 was 28\u00b79; but in 1901 it rose to 65\u00b73 per 1,000, owing to the effects of famine on the population and also to cholera, the mortality for the same years at the Central jail at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d being only 17\u00b77 and 13\u00b79 respectively. Tents, rugs, and carpets of all descriptions, belts and shoes, table linen and towels, furniture, t\u0101lpattis, cotton tweeds, checks and shirtings, and police clothing and dress for office peons are made in the jails. Printing work and bookbinding are also done, and the Jar\u012bda or State Gazette, as well as a large quantity of vernacular litho-printing, is turned out by the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d Central jail press. The total expenditure in 1901 was 5\u00b72 lakhs, but the jails were then unusually full owing to the bad season. More detailed statistics of the jails in the State are given in Table VII (p. 305) at the end of this article.\n\n| Average of five years ending 1901. |\n|----------------------------------|\n| D\u012bw\u0101ni. | Sarf-i-kh\u0101s. | Railway. | Total. |\n|---------|--------------|----------|--------|\n| Number of cases reported         | 7,806        | 971      | 247    | 9,024 |\n| Number of cases decided in       |              |          |        |       |\n| criminal courts                  | 3,767        | 441      | 157    | 4,365 |\n| Number of cases ending in        |              |          |        |       |\n| acquittal                       | 1,746        | 178      | 9      | 1,933 |\n| Number of cases ending in        |              |          |        |       |\n| conviction                      | 2,021        | 263      | 148    | 2,432 |\n\nIndigenous schools of the ordinary Indian type are found in many places. Reading, writing, and elementary arithmetic are taught, and the teacher is generally paid in kind, his income varying according to the size and importance of the village. The first English public school in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d was opened in 1834 by a clergyman of the Church of England, followed shortly after by a Roman Catholic school. An Arabic and Persian school was also founded in the city about the same time by the first Am\u012br-i-kab\u012br, a liberal patron of learning, and himself a mathematician of no mean order. State education commenced in 1854, when a school called the D\u0101r-ul-ul\u016bm was founded in the city of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. In 1859 orders were issued directing that two schools, one Persian and the other vernacular, should be opened in each t\u0101luk, and one at the headquarters of each District. Committees were appointed to super-\nvise these schools, consisting, in the case of taluk schools, of two p\u0101tels and two patw\u0101ris, with the tahsildar as president, and for District schools of a p\u0101tel, a patw\u0101ri, the tahsildar, and the police inspector, with the Third T\u0101lukd\u0101r as president. The last-named officer was ex-officio educational inspector of the District, and, as such, had to examine all schools during his tours. Education was thus entirely in the hands of the revenue authorities, and did not receive due attention.\n\nIn 1868 education was transferred to the Assistant Minister of what was then called the Miscellaneous department, and all candidates for masterships were required to go through a training at the D\u0101r-ul-ul\u016bm and obtain certificates. Two years later the control of public instruction was handed over to the late Mr. Wilkinson, then Principal of the Engineering College; but this change had no effect outside the city of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. Here, however, it led to the splitting up of the D\u0101r-ul-ul\u016bm into five branch schools, and the establishment of an Anglo-vernacular school. In 1871 a Director of Vernacular Education was appointed, who improved the system of District schools; but the actual management remained in the hands of revenue officials as before, entailing much delay in the administration. Under this cumbrous system all circular orders emanating from the office of the Director of Public Instruction had to pass through the hands of the entire series of revenue officials before they reached the various schools in the Districts.\n\nIn 1872 there were sixteen schools in the city and suburbs, in one of which English was taught. The Districts contained 125 vernacular schools. The decade 1871\u201380 saw a great development in educational matters. In 1875 five deputy-inspectors were appointed for the Districts, relieving the revenue officials of educational work. Two years later the Anglo-vernacular high school in the city was abolished, and its pupils transferred to the Ch\u0101dargh\u0101t school. An Anglo-vernacular school was also opened for the first time at Aurang\u0101b\u0101d. In 1878 the payment of fees was made compulsory in the District schools. About 1880 the Ch\u0101dargh\u0101t high school was affiliated to the Madras University as a second-grade college; and in 1881 it was raised to the rank of a first-grade college. During this decade two important schools were opened to educate the higher classes in the city. The Madrasa-i-Aliya, which had been opened as a private school under English teachers for the education of Sir S\u0101l\u0101r Jang\u2019s sons and relations, became a public school for the education of the higher classes, and as such has since had an uninterrupted career of success. In the year 1879 there were only 19 pupils on the rolls, the cost to the State per head being Rs. 1,643, whereas the school now has 200 pupils, and the cost per head is only Rs. 70 to Rs. 80. The Madrasa-i-Aizza was opened\nunder private agency for pupils of the same class, lower fees being charged, and a number of scholarships being granted.\n\nAs constituted at present the Educational department is under a Director of Public Instruction, whose proposals are submitted to the Minister through the Secretary in the Judicial, Police, and General departments and through the Assistant Minister for education. No officers are recruited in England, except a few of the staff of the Madrasa-i-Al\u012bra, now called the Niz\u0101m College. The work of inspection is carried on by five chief Inspectors. Until about ten years ago all the schools in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d were directly under the department. Gradually, however, schools are being transferred to the local boards; but it is impossible as yet for the State to withdraw altogether from the management of these schools.\n\nThere are three Arts colleges: the Niz\u0101m College at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d (first grade), the Aurang\u0101b\u0101d College (second grade), both affiliated to the Madras University, and the D\u0101r-ul-ul\u016bm or Oriental College, which sends up candidates for the Punjab Oriental titles examinations. All three are purely State institutions. Although an excellent boarding-house is attached to the Niz\u0101m College, the accommodation available is so limited, and the fees so high, that the poorer students who come from outside are not able to take advantage of it. Something is being done to provide hostels for the students of some of the District high schools.\n\nThe following table illustrates the progress made in university education:\n\n| Passes in | 1881 | 1891 | 1901 | 1913 |\n|-----------|------|------|------|------|\n| Matriculation | 3    | 4    | 18   | 13   |\n| First Intermediate in Arts or Science | 2    | 3    | 4    | 3    |\n| Ordinary Bachelors' degrees | 1    | 1    | 20   | 8    |\n| Higher and special degrees | ...  | 14   | 47   | ...  |\n\nIn 1901 the number of high schools was 16, two new ones having been added during the decade between 1891 and 1900. In all the high schools for boys English is treated as the first language, and the curriculum leads up to the Madras matriculation. The middle schools prepare pupils for the local middle school examination. In 38 English is the first language, while 15 are purely vernacular. Of the high schools, 8 are supported by the State, 7 are aided, and one is unaided, while the middle schools include 38 State, 9 aided, and 6 unaided. At present no secondary schools are under the local boards. In 1901 these schools were attended by 1.5 per cent. of the population of school-going age.\n\nIn 1883 there were 148 primary schools, of which 13 were at the\ncapital. The total number of pupils attending these schools was 7,757, representing 0.5 per cent. of the population of school-going age. In 1891 the percentage rose to 2.5. In 1901 the number of primary schools increased to 753, and the number of pupils to 41,876, giving a percentage under instruction of 2.4 to children of school-going age in that year. A system of grading the teachers has recently been introduced, and all the masters in primary schools, who formerly possessed no qualifications as a rule, are being gradually passed through the normal school. Some of the lower primary masters still receive Rs. 7, Rs. 8, or Rs. 9 a month, but a minimum of Rs. 10 is being introduced. Roughly the rate of pay may be said to be Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 in a lower primary school, and Rs. 15 to Rs. 25 in an upper primary. The inspectors are allowed to use their discretion in agricultural tracts in dispensing with full-time attendance during the months when the children\u2019s services are required in the fields.\n\nHere, as elsewhere in India, the education of girls has not kept pace with that of boys, and the number of children under instruction is 6.1 per cent. on the school-going age population for boys, and only 0.5 for girls. Progress in this direction is slow, and as far as the Districts are concerned, is hardly satisfactory. On the reorganization of the department in 1885, the State contained, outside the capital, only one Kor\u00e2n school for girls, with an attendance of 30. Another school was opened to provide for a headmaster who had lost his eyesight, his wife being appointed mistress. There were at this time three English middle schools at the capital, with a total attendance of 224 girls, and 4 English and an equal number of vernacular primary schools, attended by 99 and 323 girls respectively. The number of schools for girls was 71 in 1891, and 77 in 1901; and in the last year the total number of female pupils was 4,467. Most of the girls\u2019 schools are directly under the State, but local boards have now taken over some of these schools.\n\nThere are three main obstacles in the way of progress. The first is the reluctance of Muhammadans to teach their daughters anything beyond their scriptures; but popular sentiment is slowly giving way, and reading, writing, and arithmetic up to an elementary standard are now taught in most of the schools, besides needlework, and in one school cooking. Early marriage among Hindus is the next difficulty, but this is not of so great importance in view of the very elementary instruction it is proposed to impart. The greatest difficulty, however, is the absence of trained mistresses. The pay offered is too small to attract outsiders, and there is as yet no training school for school-mistresses. No tangible impression can be made until this want is supplied. The most notable feature under the head of female education is the foundation of a high class zanana school at Hyderabad.\nThis institution has since its foundation succeeded to a certain extent in turning out fairly well-educated members of the gentler sex, whose influence on public opinion is evidenced by an increasing desire on the part of parents of the higher classes to procure a sound education for their daughters, either by engaging the services of competent governesses at home, or sending them to this or some school outside the State. The zan\u0101na school, with a roll of 41 girls, has a larger though still somewhat insufficient staff of European and native teachers; English, Arabic, and Persian are taught, besides the usual branches that form the curriculum of an upper middle school for girls. It is expected before long to take rank as a high school. The girls' schools established by the Wesleyan and American Missionary Societies are invariably well managed and do a great amount of good work.\n\nA small engineering school, first opened at Warangal for the purpose of training young men for the subordinate grades of the Public Works department, was transferred to Hyder\u0101b\u0101d in 1896. A law school with two lecturers was organized in 1899. There is also a medical school at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, supported by the State, of which the Residency Surgeon is the principal. It has, however, no connexion with the Educational department. A thriving normal school exists at the capital, through which all teachers of primary schools are being gradually passed, while another for girls at Secunder\u0101b\u0101d, founded by the Wesleyan Mission, supplies teachers for the girls' schools under that agency and is doing excellent work. The industrial school at Aurang\u0101b\u0101d was established about 1889, and has done a great deal to revive and improve many industries for which that place was once famous. Another industrial school was opened at Warangal in 1890, and has been transferred to Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, where it is doing good work. A Sanskrit school, started at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d in 1899, is aided by the State.\n\nProvision is made for the education of Europeans and Eurasians in eight schools at the capital, which receive grants from the British Government and work under the Bengal code for European schools. Three of them receive an additional grant from the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State. In 1901 these schools contained 650 pupils. Some of the pupils find employment as officers in the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d regular troops, while the Niz\u0101m's Guaranteed State Railway, in its various departments, provides for others.\n\nWhile the Muhammadans form only 10.4 per cent. of the population of the State, they include 83 per cent. of the students in colleges, 45 per cent. of the pupils in secondary, and 42 per cent. of the pupils in primary schools. These results are due to the position held by Muhammadans in a State of which the ruler belongs to their religion. It is noticeable that the Hindus are more successful in examinations, proportionately to their numbers, than the Muhammadans.\nOf the aboriginal tribes, the Gonds and Lamb\u0101dis form the majority, but none avail themselves of the opportunities for educating their children placed within their reach. The Bhils, chiefly found in the Aurang\u0101b\u0101d Division, are beginning to send their children to school. The schools throughout the State are open to children of all castes without distinction; but in practice few of the lower classes avail themselves of the permission, partly owing to the prejudices of the higher castes. In 1901, 23 boys belonging to the aboriginal tribes and 626 outcastes were at school, the greater number of the latter being found in the different mission schools.\n\nAccording to the Census of 1901 literate persons numbered 29.55 per 1,000 of the total population, but taking males and females separately, the proportions are 54.7 and 3.4 respectively. Persons literate in English were 1.3 per 1,000 of the total population. Of the various religions, the Christians were far ahead of the others in point of literacy, there being 443 literate persons in every 1,000 professing that faith. The Musalm\u0101ns came next with 54, while the Hindus and Animists followed with 25 and 1 respectively.\n\nParticulars of the expenditure on education and number of institutions and scholars will be found in Tables VIII and IX (p. 306).\n\nThe first systematic attempt to control the Press and the registration of books and newspapers in the State was made in 1886. The total number of newspapers and periodicals published in 1901 was 14, of which 12 were in Urd\u016b, and 2 in Urd\u016b and Mar\u0101th\u012b combined. No English papers are issued here, although several published elsewhere have a large circulation in the State, and are mainly devoted to Hyder\u0101b\u0101d affairs. Seven of the fourteen were newspapers, and the remainder monthly magazines. Politics are discussed in the former, while the latter are devoted to legal, social, and literary topics. The Mushir-i-Deccan, a daily paper, has the largest circulation.\n\nThe total number of books registered in 1901 was 23, which may be classified according to their subject matter as follows: law (6), history (2), religion (4), poetry (3), medical (1), mathematics (1), fiction (2), and miscellaneous (4). Apart from an Urd\u016b translation of the biography of the late Amir of K\u0101bul, these books are more or less original in character.\n\nThe first medical institution opened in the State was the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d Medical school, founded in 1846, which has done much useful work in training medical officers and subordinates for the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d medical service, and hospital assistants for Ber\u0101r. At first instruction was imparted in Urd\u016b, but since 1884 English has been the medium. Till 1885 a board of medical officers from Secunder\u0101b\u0101d conducted the examinations; but since that year the written part has been supervised by a board\nof examiners of the Madras Medical College or the Bombay Grant Medical College, the oral examination being conducted by a medical board from Secunder\u0101b\u0101d. The course is approximately the same as the L. M. & S. of the Madras University.\n\nAt present the State medical department is under a Director, who is also the Residency Surgeon, assisted by a competent staff of surgeons at head-quarters. The District staff consists of from 3 to 5 surgeons, 1 to 5 hospital assistants, 4 to 7 compounders, and from 5 to 11 vaccinators, according to the extent and requirements of each District. Most of the surgeons are passed students of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d medical school. There are two lady doctors at Aurang\u0101b\u0101d; while Gulbarga, Raich\u016br, and Warangal Districts each have one. At Hyder\u0101b\u0101d a large staff of medical men is maintained, there being 15 surgeons, 7 hospital assistants, 24 compounders, and 11 vaccinators, besides a number of nurses with diplomas who tend the sick in the hospitals. The total strength for the State is 74 surgeons, 12 lady doctors, 31 hospital assistants, 104 compounders, and 116 vaccinators.\n\nStatistics are only available from 1884\u20135. In that year there were 6 hospitals in the city and suburbs and 48 dispensaries in the Districts. By 1891 the number of dispensaries had increased to 67, and in 1901 it rose to 84. The total number of out-patients treated in all institutions in 1884\u20135, 1891, and 1901 was 292,515, 384,660, and 636,044 respectively. The major operations performed in the same years were 393, 3,313, and 4,628, while minor operations numbered 3,377, 16,795, and 1,500. In the san\u0101na department for parda females attached to the Afzal Ganj Hospital at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d city, the number of cases treated in 1901 was about 3,000 and the operations performed 2,000. The whole cost of the department is met from State funds, and the expenditure in 1901 was 5.4 lakhs.\n\nNo separate lunatic asylum is maintained, though there is some accommodation for lunatics in the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d Central jail. In 1891 this contained 7 criminal and 29 other lunatics, while in 1901 their numbers were 21 and 109 respectively. The whole of the expenditure is borne by the State, the cost in 1891 and 1901 being Rs. 2,411 and Rs. 9,600 respectively. The principal cause of insanity is said to be the use of narcotic drugs and spirits.\n\nVaccination was commenced in 1884\u20135, when 48 vaccinators were employed, and the number of successful operations was 44,062, the cost per case being Rs. 1.3\u20130. In 1891 there were 76,880 successful cases, while in 1901 the number was only 37,880. The increase in 1891 was due to the larger number of vaccinators employed by the local boards, while in 1901 a large number of vaccinators were deputed on famine and plague duty. The cost of the department in 1891 and 1901 was Rs. 49,160 and Rs. 57,302 respectively; the average per\nsuccessful case for these years being R. 0-10-3 and Rs. 1-3-0. Operations are carried out exclusively with calf lymph, which is prepared at the vaccination depot in the State. Vaccination is performed according to the European method, and inoculation does not seem to be practised.\n\nHyderabad State was included in the Great Trigonometrical Survey. The subsequent topographical surveys were based on, or extended from, the main series of triangulation. The Darbar co-operated in this important work. It appears probable that Todar Mal's revenue system was introduced in most of the Maratha Districts of the State early in the seventeenth century by Malik Ambar and Murshid Kuli Khan, and was based on a rough survey of lands. On the formation of regular Districts about 1865-6, the bigha of 3,600 square yards was taken as a standard, and lands were roughly measured. About 1876 it was decided to commence accurate survey operations, and the work was first undertaken in Aurangabad District, and subsequently extended to other taluks and Districts. In this systematic survey the areas were reckoned in English acres. The Aurangabad and Gulbarga Divisions were surveyed and settled by the end of 1894. The Bidar and Warangal Divisions were also surveyed and settled by the end of 1904 and 1905, the only portions still remaining unsurveyed and unsettled being the District of Adilabad (Sirpur Tandur) and certain taluks of Karimnagar (Elgandal) District.\n\n[Syed Hossain Bilgrami and C.

river, a tributary of the Kistna. It is the fourth largest city in the whole of India. The population (including the suburbs, Residency Bazars, and the adjoining cantonment) was: (1881) 367,417, (1891) 415,039, and (1901) 448,466. In the last year, Hindus numbered 243,241, Musalm\u0101ns 189,152, and Christians 13,923. There were also 863 Sikhs, 929 P\u0101rs\u012bs, 318 Jains, and 40 others. Hyder\u0101b\u0101d is on the Niz\u0101m\u2019s State Railway, distant by rail from Bombay 492 miles, from Madras 533 miles, and from Calcutta 987 miles. The city was founded in 1589 by Muhammad Kuli, the fifth Kutb Sh\u0101hi king, who ruled at Golconda, five miles west of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. It was first named Bh\u0101gnagar, but the name was afterwards changed to Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. It continued to prosper until Aurangzeb began to interfere between the king and his discontented minister, Mir Jumla, in 1665. In 1687 Golconda was stormed and Hyder\u0101b\u0101d fell into the hands of the Mughals, in whose possession it remained until the first Niz\u0101m proclaimed his independence, and made it his capital.\n\nThe city is surrounded by a stone wall flanked with bastions, and pierced with thirteen gates and twelve khirkis or posterns. It is built in the form of a parallelogram, 6 miles in circumference and \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) square miles in area. The wall was commenced by Mub\u0101riz Kh\u0101n, the last Mughal S\u016bbahd\u016br, and completed by the first of the Niz\u0101ms. The city has extended beyond its former limits on the north and east. Four bridges span the M\u016bsi. The Pur\u0101na Pul, or \u2018old bridge,\u2019 is the westernmost, and the Oliphant Bridge the easternmost, while between these two are the Afzal Bridge and the Champ\u0101 Gate Bridge.\n\nThe most imposing of the buildings due to the Kutb Sh\u0101hi kings is the Ch\u0101r Min\u0101r, or \u2018four minarets,\u2019 erected in 1591, and occupying a central position in the city, with four roads radiating from its base. The minarets, 180 feet high, spring from the abutments of open arches facing the cardinal points. During the occupation of the Mughals, one of the minarets was struck by lightning, and its reconstruction cost Rs. 60,000. M. Bussy, the French general, and his troops occupied the Ch\u0101r Min\u0101r in 1756. The building was thoroughly renovated by Sir S\u0101l\u0101r Jang a few years before his death. Close to the Ch\u0101r Min\u0101r are the Ch\u0101r Kam\u0101n, or \u2018four arches,\u2019 built in 1593 over four streets, leading to the four quarters of the city. The Ch\u0101r-s\u016b-k\u0101-Hauz, or \u2018cistern of four roads,\u2019 is situated to the north of the Ch\u0101r Min\u0101r. The king had a pavilion erected near the cistern, from which he used to witness the manoeuvring of his troops. The D\u0101r-ush-shifa (hospital), about 200 yards to the north-west of the Pur\u0101ni Haveli (\u2018old palace\u2019), built by Sultan Kuli Kutb Sh\u0101h, is a large building consisting of a paved quadrangular courtyard, with chambers all round for the\naccommodation of the sick. A number of native physicians were formerly maintained to minister to the sick and to teach medicine, but the building is now used as a barrack for some of the irregular troops. Opposite the entrance is a fine mosque erected at the same time as the hospital. The Ash\u00fbr Kh\u00e2na, a large building west of Sir S\u00e2l\u00e2r Jang\u2019s palace, was erected by Sult\u00e2n Muhammad Kuli Kutb Sh\u00e2h in 1594, at a cost of Rs. 66,000. It is used for the Muharram ceremonies. The Pur\u00e2na Pul (\u2018old bridge\u2019) connects the city with the K\u00e2rv\u00e2n road to Golconda. It consists of 23 arches, and is 600 feet long, 33 broad, and 54 above the river-bed, and was built in 1593. The river is very narrow here, and the banks are steep. The Gosha Mahal palace, erected by Abul Hasan, the last Kutb Sh\u00e2hi king, stands a mile north of the city, and has a large cistern and pleasure-grounds for the zan\u00e2na. It was used until lately as a barrack, but is now a military club. The Mecca mosque, situated to the south-west of the Ch\u00e2r Min\u00e2r, is 225 feet long, 180 broad, and 75 high, and is built entirely of stone, occupying a paved quadrangle 360 feet square. Fifteen arches support the roof, which is surmounted by two large domes, rising 100 feet above it. It can accommodate 10,000 worshippers. Muhammad\u00b9 Kutb Sh\u00e2h commenced the building, and after his death its construction was continued by Abul Hasan, but Aurangzeb completed it. Niz\u00e2m Ali Kh\u00e2n and all his successors are interred in the grounds of this mosque. The J\u00e2ma Masjid, which is near the Ch\u00e2r Min\u00e2r, was built in 1596. Ruins of a Turkish bath are to be seen in the courtyard. With the exception of the Mecca Masjid and the Gosha Mahal, all these buildings were constructed by Sult\u00e2n Muhammad Kuli Kutb Sh\u00e2h, who is said to have spent three millions sterling on public buildings and irrigation works, while his nobles followed his example. An extensive burial-ground, known as Mir Momin\u2019s Daira, was originally consecrated as the necropolis of the Shiah sect by Mir Momin, who came to Hyder\u00e2b\u00e2d from Karbal\u00e2 in the reign of Abdull\u00e2h Kutb Sh\u00e2h. It contains his remains, but now both Shias and Sunnis are buried here. Sir S\u00e2l\u00e2r Jang\u2019s family burial-ground lies to the south of the Daira.\n\nAmong the more recent buildings may be mentioned the Pur\u00e2ni Havel\u00ee (\u2018old palace\u2019), an extensive building in the north-eastern quarter of the city, built by the first of the Niz\u00e2ms, and still occasionally used by the present ruler. The Niz\u00e2m\u2019s Chaumahalla palace consists of three quadrangles, with handsome buildings on either side, and large cisterns in the centre. The palace is luxuriously and tastefully furnished, and the zan\u00e2na or ladies\u2019 apartments lie beyond the third quadrangle. There are other royal residences at Golconda, Sur\u00fbrnagar, Maul\u00e2 Ali.\n\n\u00b9 Not to be confounded with his uncle and predecessor, Muhammad Kuli, the founder of Hyder\u00e2b\u00e2d city.\nAsafnagar, Lingampalli, and Malakpet; but His Highness at present usually resides in Sirdar Villa at Malakpet near the racecourse. Salar Jang's palace is situated near the Afzal Gate and consists of two portions: one containing the Baradari and Lakkar Kot ('wooden palace') lies on the right bank of the Musi, and the other is beyond the road leading to the Purani Haveli. Both are extensive buildings covering a large space of ground. Shams-ul-Umar\u0101's Baradari, situated in the west of the city, was built by the first Shams-ul-Umar\u0101 on an extensive piece of ground. The Falaknum\u0101, a very fine palace, was built by the late Sir Vikar-ul-Umar\u0101 on the summit of a hill in the southern suburb of the city, at a cost, it is said, of 35 lakhs. The view of the city and suburbs from this palace is most striking, and no building in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d equals it in point of architecture or design. It was purchased by the Niz\u0101m in 1897. The Jah\u0101nnum\u0101 palace and its beautiful gardens, belonging to the late Sir Asm\u0101n Jah, are situated north of the Falaknum\u0101. The palace and the bungalows in the gardens contain a great number of ingenious mechanical toys.\n\nThe suburbs may be divided into those beyond the river M\u016bsi and those adjoining the city. The former comprise Begam B\u0101z\u0101r, K\u0101rv\u0101n, Afzal Ganj, Mushir\u0101b\u0101d, Khairat\u0101b\u0101d, Saif\u0101b\u0101d, and Ch\u0101dargh\u0101t, extending for a distance of 3 miles from east to west and an average breadth of 1\u00bd miles from north to south, covering an area of over 5 square miles. The Residency Bazars are situated to the south-east of these suburbs and to the north-east of the city. The other suburbs adjoining the city to the east and south are known as Y\u0101k\u016btpura, Malakpet, and Jah\u0101nnum\u0101, and occupy an area of 4 square miles.\n\nThe Residency is situated on the left bank of the M\u016bsi, opposite the north-eastern corner of the city. The building is an imposing one, and stands in the midst of a beautiful park-like expanse, with handsomely laid-out gardens. It was commenced in 1800, under the supervision of Mr. Russell of the Madras Engineers, and was completed about 1807. It contains a Darb\u0101r Hall on the ground floor, measuring 60 feet by 33 and 50 feet high. The grounds contain bungalows for the First and Second Assistant Residents, while the Residency Surgeon resides in a bungalow outside the walls. On the south side are large ranges of offices. Beyond the north gate are the court of the Superintendent of Residency Bazars, the Residency hospital, and the Residency high school and clock-tower; while the telegraph office is situated to the west of the building. A cemetery close by contains, among other tombs, those of two Residents, Mr. G. A. Bushby and Mr. Roberts, who died respectively in 1856 and 1868; and of Sir W. Rumbold, Bart., a partner in the house of Palmer & Co., who died in 1833.\n\nThe Residency is surrounded on all sides by populous bazars, over\nwhich the Resident exercises civil and criminal jurisdiction. The population of the bazars in 1901 was 16,904, and they form a great centre of trade, where branch houses and representatives of all the wealthy bankers in India are to be found. West of the Residency hospital is the Local Funds building. On the right of the road leading from the western gate of the Residency is located the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d branch of the Bank of Bengal, an imposing stone building. The British Post Office is situated in the north-west corner of the limits of the Residency Bazars, and a little to the north lie St. George's Church and schools, adjoining which is the old cemetery.\n\nThe Husain S\u0101gar, a large sheet of water, which when full extends over an area of 8 square miles, lies between Secunder\u0101b\u0101d on the north and Saif\u0101b\u0101d, a portion of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, on the south, and is the source of water-supply for the Residency and suburbs north of the M\u00fcsi river. The dam is 2,500 yards long, and forms the road connecting the northern suburbs with Secunder\u0101b\u0101d. It was built by Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kutb Sh\u0101h, in about 1575, at a cost of 2\u00bd lakhs. The Mir Alam, situated to the south-west of the city, is another magnificent sheet of water, 8 miles in circumference. The dam consists of a series of 21 semicircular retaining walls with their convex side facing the water. Its total length is 1,120 yards, and it was constructed by French engineers in the Niz\u0101m's service. M\u012br Alam, the Minister, built this, and the B\u0101r\u0101dari and other buildings, out of the prize-money which fell to his share after the fall of Seringapatam. The dam alone cost 8 lakhs. The city and suburbs are now amply supplied with water from these two large tanks. Water-works have been constructed, though the systems are not yet complete. This supply has led to a considerable improvement in sanitation; and cholera, which used to be an annual visitor, has not been known in the city for the last few years.\n\nThe houses of well-to-do people in the city are chiefly built of stone and brick, standing within large gardens. Those of the commoner people were formerly built of mud, but are now gradually being replaced by brick structures. The old streets and lanes were narrow, but have of late been widened through the exertions of the municipality. In the northern suburbs, however, most of the houses are of a much superior plan, resembling the bungalows of Europeans, and are situated in suitable compounds. It may be said that practically three-fourths of the old city and suburbs have been rebuilt or renovated since the ministry of the late Sir S\u0101l\u0101r Jang, in addition to the buildings erected during the last half-century.\n\nHyder\u0101b\u0101d now contains three colleges, several English and vernacular schools, a large Roman Catholic church, and a number of places of worship for other Christian denominations. The public gardens,\nbeautifully laid out, with two large tanks in the centre, and surrounded by a picturesque wall, lie at the foot of the Naubat Pah\u0101r. To the south of these gardens is the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d station of the Niz\u0101m\u2019s Guaranteed State Railway. Near the Afzal Bridge are the Afzal Ganj Hospital and Mosque; the former has accommodation for 78 in-patients, and a large staff of surgeons and nurses. Most of the State secretariats and other offices are situated in Saif\u0101b\u0101d and Ch\u0101dargh\u0101t, but the High Court and the Small Cause and Magistrates\u2019 Courts, the Treasury, and the Accountant General\u2019s and certain other offices are located in the city. The system of municipal administration and the arts and manufactures carried on in the city are described in the article on Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State.\n\nHyder\u0101b\u0101d District.\u2014District in the province of Sind, Bombay, lying between $24^\\circ 13'$ and $27^\\circ 14'$ N. and $67^\\circ 52'$ and $69^\\circ 22'$ E., with an area of 8,291 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the State of Khairpur; on the east by Khairpur and the Thar and P\u0101rkar District; on the south by the Rann of Cutch; and on the west by the river Indus and Kar\u0101chi District.\n\nThe District is a vast alluvial plain, 210 miles long by 48 broad. Fertile along the course of the Indus, which forms its western boundary, it degenerates towards the east into sandy tracts, which have recently, by the construction of the J\u0101mr\u0101o and Nasrat Canals, been reclaimed from the desert and promise to become most fertile regions. A small limestone range in the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d t\u0101luka, known as the Ganjo hills, runs nearly due south parallel to the river for about 14 miles. The monotony of the great flats is relieved by the fringe of forests which marks the course of the river, and by the avenues of trees that line the irrigation channels branching eastward from the beneficent stream. The Tando subdivision, in the south of the District, has special features in its large natural watercourses (dhoras), and grass-covered depressions (channs or dhandlis), which retain rain and surplus canal-water for many months and nourish a luxuriant growth of bab\u016bl trees on their margins. The Indus borders the District for 150 miles.\n\nExcept in the neighbourhood of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d city, where there are hills of K\u012brthar limestone (middle eocene), the entire District is occupied by the alluvium of the Indus.\n\nThe fruit trees common in the District are the mango, lime, mulberry, date, plantain, orange, peach, fig, pomegranate, and grape. Of forest trees, the commonest is the bab\u016bl; others are the kandi, geduri (Cordia latifolia), ber, bah\u0101n, and several varieties of tamarisk. On the roadside and in gardens the bar (Ficus indica), the pipal, the t\u0101li or black-wood, the siras (Albizia Lebbek), the nim, the horse-radish tree, and the tamarind are met with. The bush jungle comprises the wild\ncaper, the *khabar* (*Salvadora persica*), the *jhar* (*Salvadora oleoides*), the *ak*, and the camel-thorn or *kas* (*Alhagi maurorum*). Wild grasses useful for fodder are the *kh\u00eep*, *chabar*, *sawari*, and *makhi*; others used in mixing mud plaster are the drab and *kal*; of reeds, the *kanh*, used in making reed mats, and the bulrush are the most common.\n\nThe wolf, fox, jackal, hog deer, antelope, hare, badger, otter, and hog almost complete the list of wild animals. Among birds, the *til\u00fbr* is remarkable, and most of the common kinds of wild duck and water-fowl are to be met with during the cold season. Sand-grouse, quail, and black and grey partridge are common. Venomous reptiles abound, including the cobra, the *kappar* (*Echis carinata*), and the *karait* (*Bungarus caeruleus*). The Indus supplies a great variety of fish, of which the *pala* is said to be peculiar to this river and is caught only between March and August.\n\nGreat variations of climate obtain within the District. The hot season lasts from April till July, with an average maximum temperature of $104^\\circ$. In August and September the heat is tempered by rain, and an immense amount of water is used in cultivation. In October the mercury rises again temporarily, but for the rest of the year the weather is dry and pleasant. In December and January frosts are not uncommon at night; at Guni, on the night of December 26, 1903, the thermometer fell to $22^\\circ$ and on the following night to $27^\\circ$. Frosts such as these cause widespread damage to the cotton crop. In the north of the District greater extremes of heat and cold are met with, while in the south the proximity of the sea adds moisture to the air. Fogs are not uncommon in the cold season. In the Tando subdivision fevers are prevalent in consequence of the swamps, especially as the inundation recedes; but on the whole the District in normal years is healthy.\n\nThe annual rainfall averages 5.7 inches, the local distribution being: Hyder\u00e2b\u00e2d 7, B\u00e2din 6, and Naushahro 3 inches. In 1869 there was an extraordinary fall of 20 inches all over the District. The same year is memorable for an outbreak of epidemic cholera, and in the Hyder\u00e2b\u00e2d *t\u00e2luka* of severe fever.\n\nThe history of Sind since 1768 centres in this District, for all the events of the eighteenth century affected more or less nearly Hyder\u00e2b\u00e2d, the modern capital of the province. Under the old name of Nerankot, this city was, in the eighth century, sufficiently important to be the first object of Muhammad bin K\u00e2sim\u2019s invasion of Lower Sind. A thousand years later, Ghul\u00e2m Sh\u00e2h, the Kalhora chief, burst from the desert, overthrew his usurping brothers, and made Nerankot, then renamed Hyder\u00e2b\u00e2d, his capital. Thenceforth this District assumes a foremost place in the history of Sind. Under the T\u00e2lpur dynasty it remained the leading state: and\nwithin its limits were fought the battles of Mi\u0101ni and Dabo, which decided (1843) the fate of Sind. Its local history is, however, so mixed up with that of the province, that little could be here said of it separately which will not more properly find a place under the history of Sind. Before 1861, Umarkot District (now in Thar and P\u0101rkar District) and a large portion of the eastern delta (now part of the Sh\u0101hbandar t\u0101luka of Kar\u0101chi) were included in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. Since 1884 some trifling adjustments of territory have been made with Kar\u0101chi and Thar and P\u0101rkar, and in 1894 the t\u0101luka of Mirpur Kh\u0101s was transferred to the latter. The parganas of Kandi\u0101ro and Naushahro were resumed by Government in 1852 from the domains of Mir Ali Mur\u0101d of Khairpur, on his public conviction for forgery and fraud, and transferred to this District.\n\nNumerous tombs with inscriptions are met with throughout the District. The antiquities of special interest at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d are the tombs of the Kalhora and T\u0101lpur rulers, richly decorated with coloured tiles in geometric and floral patterns; the colours are cruder and the designs less artistic than in similar work at Tatta in Kar\u0101chi District.\n\nThe population of the District has increased by 47 per cent. since 1872. The totals at the enumerations were: (1872) 677,994, (1881) 703,637, and (1891) 861,994. According to the Census of 1901, the total was 989,030, distributed as follows:\n\n| T\u0101luka     | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Guni       | 986                 | 1               | 158      | 91,506     | 93                        | + 14                                          | 2,154                                  |\n| B\u0101din      | 792                 | 165             |          | 81,790     | 103                       | + 11                                          | 731                                    |\n| Tando B\u0101go | 697                 | 141             |          | 74,876     | 107                       | + 18                                          | 694                                    |\n| Dero Mohbat| 604                 | 137             |          | 46,919     | 78                        | + 12                                          | 315                                    |\n| Hyder\u0101b\u0101d  | 398                 | 98              |          | 138,021    | 347                       | + 13                                          | 14,516                                 |\n| Tando Al\u0101hy\u0101r | 690            | 107             |          | 87,990     | 128                       | + 15                                          | 2,078                                  |\n| Sh\u0101hd\u0101dpur | 644                 | 102             |          | 73,504     | 114                       | + 25                                          | 1,532                                  |\n| H\u0101la       | 502                 | 103             |          | 98,230     | 195                       | + 8                                           | 1,235                                  |\n| Sakrand    | 786                 | 109             |          | 64,036     | 84                        | + 36                                          | 810                                    |\n| Moro       | 402                 | 78              |          | 66,641     | 169                       | + 20                                          | 1,369                                  |\n| Naushahro  | 539                 | 105             |          | 97,506     | 181                       | + 7                                           | 3,056                                  |\n| Kandi\u0101ro   | 320                 | 69              |          | 62,937     | 197                       | + 13                                          | 2,158                                  |\n| Nasrat*    | 930                 | 74              |          | 5,074      | 5                        |                                               | 300                                    |\n\nDistrict total | 8,291               | 7               | 1,446    | 989,030    | 119                       | + 15                                          | 30,948                                 |\n\n* This t\u0101luka was formed in 1903 from portions of the Moro and Sh\u0101hd\u0101dpur t\u0101lkas.\n\nThe District contains 7 towns and 1,405 villages. The towns are: Hyder\u0101b\u0101d City, the head-quarters, Matiari, Tando Adam, H\u0101la,\n\n1 According to the Census of 1901, 41 new villages have sprung up in the parts of the District that were formerly desert.\nTANDO MUHAMMAD KHAN, NASARPUR, and TANDO ALAHVAR. The density of population is 119 persons per square mile, but varies considerably in different parts. Sindhi, the chief vernacular of the District, is spoken by 91 per cent. of the people. Classified according to religion, Hindus form 24 per cent., and Musalmans 75 per cent.\n\nAmong the Hindus, the chief castes are Lohanas (148,000), who are clerks and traders; Dheds (24,000), who are scavengers; and Kolis (15,000), who are employed in cultivation. Of the Muhammadans, nearly three-fourths are Sindis, the descendants of the original Hindu population converted to Islam during the Umayyid dynasty of Khalifs, chiefly represented by the Sammas (226,000) and the Sumras (36,000). There are 27,000 Muhammadan Jats. The Sindis have a fine physique, but are timid and lacking in moral fibre; they are looked down upon by the more warlike tribes of the District as natural serfs. Next in point of numbers among the Muhammadans are the Baluchis (163,000), subdivided into a great number of tribes, the chief being the Rind (21,000), Dombki (10,000), Khosa (12,000), Jamali (11,000), Jakranji (3,000), Lighari (21,000), Chandia (Husaini and Hajji) (22,000), Korai (9,000), Jatoi (14,000), Burdis (Sundar and Hajji) (18,000), Marri (11,000), and Lashari (13,000). Their leading clan is the Rind, and its members are held by the rest of the community in high respect. Fairer in complexion than the Sindis, they are also a hardier race; honourable after their own code, and manly in field sports. They are Sunnis by sect. More important, however, as regards social status and personal character are the Pathans (6,000), found chiefly about Hyderabad and Upper Sind, with the naturalized Arabs (37,000) returning themselves as Alwi (54), Bani Abbas (1,300), Husaini (10,000), Hasani (2,500), Kureshi (9,000), and Kalhora (8,000). They are superior to the foregoing in personal appearance and morale. From their being held in great esteem by the princes of the Kalhora dynasty, they acquired considerable grants of land, which they still possess. The remaining Muhammadan classes worthy of mention are the Muhanos or fishermen (33,000) and the Shaikhs (7,000), the latter being Memons, formerly Hindus who emigrated from Cutch to Sind under Kalhora rule and devoted themselves to trade.\n\nThe number of persons supported by agriculture form 64 per cent. of the total population. General labour supports 6 per cent., industry 15 per cent., and commerce one per cent.\n\nThe total Christian population numbers 1,345, of whom 192 are natives, mostly Roman Catholics. The Church Missionary Society has a branch at Hyderabad, where it maintains a high school and a primary school for boys, attended respectively by 56 and 113 pupils. The Zanana Mission, established at Hyderabad in 1885, has a dispensary for women and 6 primary schools for girls.\nThe different kinds of soils prevailing in the District are four in number: soil containing a large admixture of sand, but with good productive capabilities; hard and firm soil; sandy soil; soil strongly impregnated with salt. The greater part of the land in the northernmost division is very fertile. In the H\u0101la and Tando subdivisions, towards the east, there is much sandy and unprofitable land. In the Tando subdivision, to the south and east, are extensive salt plains.\n\nThe chief statistics of cultivation in 1903\u20134 are shown below, in square miles:\n\n| Taluka     | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste | Forests |\n|------------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|--------|\n| Guni       | 986   | 384        | 161       | 295              | 9      |\n| Badin      | 792   | 254        | 178       | 437              | ...    |\n| Tando B\u0101go | 650   | 271        | 145       | 341              | ...    |\n| Dero Mohbat| 723   | 378        | 153       | 237              | ...    |\n| Hyder\u0101b\u0101d  | 384   | 217        | 101       | 34               | 25     |\n| Tando Alahy\u0101r | 576 | 287        | 91        | 238              | ...    |\n| Sh\u0101hd\u0101dpur | 545   | 297        | 110       | 135              | ...    |\n| H\u0101la       | 511   | 301        | 122       | 69               | 64     |\n| Sakrand    | 494   | 231        | 72        | 115              | 58     |\n| Moro       | 477   | 232        | 93        | 86               | 15     |\n| Naushahro  | 545   | 301        | 132       | 81               | 19     |\n| Kandiaro   | 321   | 188        | 71        | 53               | 38     |\n| Nasrat     | 931   | 110        | 49        | 582              | ...    |\n| **Total**  | **7,935** | **3,451** | **1,478** | **2,793**        | **228** |\n\n* This differs from the area shown at the Census of 1901, being based upon more recent information.\n\nThe principal crops are: jow\u0101r (163 square miles), b\u0101jra (504), rice (319), wheat (138), cotton (143), and oilseeds (149). Wheat and jow\u0101r are the staples of the north, b\u0101jra of the central or H\u0101la subdivision, and rice and b\u0101jra of the south. The area under cultivation is gradually increasing, more especially in the J\u0101mrao tract, where the water-supply is assured. Garden cultivation is limited to the neighbourhood of large towns, where vegetables are grown to a small extent. Sugar-cane is raised in the south. Large advances have been made under the Land Improvements and Agriculturists\u2019 Loans Acts, amounting during the decade ending 1903\u20134 to 7\u00bd lakhs, of which one lakh was advanced in 1899\u20131900, 1\u00b79 lakhs in 1902\u20133, and one lakh in 1903\u20134.\n\nThe domestic animals include the horse, camel, bullock, buffalo, donkey, sheep, and goat. Camels and bullocks are used for draught, and in turning water-wheels for the irrigation of land.\n\nAgriculture in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d is chiefly dependent upon artificial irrigation, and is regarded as a lottery in which the cultivator stakes his labour and seed on the chance of getting an exactly suitable flood.\nIf the water rises too high, or not sufficiently high, the cultivator loses his crop. The mud flats of the Indus are cultivated without irrigation, as the river recedes. The District contains a number of wells, especially in the Naushahro subdivision, which are utilized in growing rabi crops (especially wheat). There are 281 canals, all of which are fed by the Indus and are Government property. In addition to these, numerous smaller canals and watercourses are the property of landholders. Of the Government canals, 35 are main channels, which tap the Indus direct; the remainder are connecting branches. Of the total cultivated area, 1,478 square miles, or 42 per cent., were irrigated in 1903-4. The various sources of irrigation are: Government canals, 1,387 square miles; private canals, 2 square miles; wells, 13 square miles; and other sources, 76 square miles. Nearly 30 per cent. of the irrigated land is supplied by the Fuleli Canal, a large natural channel, which was formerly a branch of the Indus on the left bank of that river, taking off 5 miles north of Kotri. Its course, which is south-easterly, runs through portions of the Tando subdivision. About 101 canals and distributaries are taken directly from it. It is now a perennial canal, and steam-launches have recently been introduced for navigation, which is possible as far as Talh\u0101r, 44 miles from Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, for launches, and 20 miles farther for cargo boats. The J\u0101mr\u0101o Canal, recently completed, supplies more than 86 square miles. Of the other canals that supply the District, the chief are: the Nasrat (83 square miles), the Great Marak (61), the Gharo Mahm\u016bdo (104), the D\u0101d (118), the Naul\u0101khi (84), the Nasir Wah (54), and the Sarfr\u0101z (45).\n\nForests cover an aggregate area of 228 square miles. They skirt the Indus from the Naushahro down to the Tando subdivision. Many of them are of considerable extent, especially in the Naushahro subdivision, those of Bhour, Bhorti, Khairodero, and Mari being each above 10,000 acres in area. The revenue derived from these forests in 1903-4 amounted to 1.45 lakhs. The chief indigenous trees are the pipal, nim, t\u0101li or black-wood, siras, ber, bahin, bar, kandi, geduri, babul, and several varieties of tamarisk.\n\nAmong the mineral productions of the District may be mentioned met, a kind of fuller's earth, which is dug from mines in the Ganjo hills near Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. Salt of an excellent quality is found on the Rann of Cutch, but the deposits are too remote to be worked with profit.\n\nThe manufactures of the District, once famous, are in a state of decline. The Hyder\u0101b\u0101d taluka still enjoys much of its old pre-eminence for lacquered work. In the days of the Mirs, arms made at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d city were also held in the highest esteem; but, owing to the reduced demand for chain armour, shields, and sabres under British rule, the trade is now in abeyance. In the H\u0101la subdivision, the special features\nof the local industries are striped and brilliant cloths known as *sisis* and *khes*, and also glazed pottery. The latter work is turned to various ornamental purposes, especially tiling, and is remarkable for excellence of both glaze and colour. In nearly all parts of the District some industry is carried on; blankets, coarse cotton cloths, camel saddles, rugs, felt, and metal-work being perhaps the commonest products. In 1905 there were 24 cotton-ginning factories in the District, giving employment to nearly 4,200 persons.\n\nThe transit trade is considerable, the chief centre of distribution being Hyder\u0101b\u0101d city. The chief imports are cotton, sugar, spices, and English-made articles, and the chief exports are cotton, wheat, oilseeds, and millet; the three first go to Europe, and the last to Cutch and the desert portion of Thar and P\u0101rkar. Twenty fairs, lasting from three to fifteen days, are held in the District.\n\nThe Indus is navigable by country boats at all times of the year. The North-Western Railway connects Hyder\u0101b\u0101d city with Kar\u0101chi and Rohri, crossing the river at Kotri. A branch of this railway, which until 1901 ended at Sh\u0101dip\u0101li, has been replaced by a narrow-gauge line giving connexion with Bombay by means of the Jodhpur-Bikaner line, thus opening up the eastern portion of the District. The southern portion, forming the Tando subdivision, is being connected by a broad-gauge line with Bombay, now open from Hyder\u0101b\u0101d to Badin. The total length of roads is 2,275 miles, of which 37 are metalled. Of the total length, 28 miles are maintained by the Public Works department, and the remainder by local boards. The chief roads are those from Hyder\u0101b\u0101d to Kandi\u0101ro, and from Hyder\u0101b\u0101d to Badin. Avenues of trees are maintained on 322 miles.\n\nThe Collector has a staff of three Assistant Collectors for the H\u0101la, Naushahro, and Tando subdivisions, and a Deputy-Collector for a portion of the H\u0101la subdivision. H\u0101la comprises the *t\u0101lukas*; Naushahro comprises Naushahro, Kandi\u0101ro, Moro, Nasrat, and Sakrand; Tando comprises Guni, Badin, Tando B\u0101go, and Dero Mohbat with the Digri *mah\u0101l*. A portion of the District irrigated by the J\u0101mrao Canal is in charge of an officer called the \u2018Colonization officer,\u2019 who is invested with the powers of a Collector and also administers the Nasrat *t\u0101luka*.\n\nThe District and Sessions Judge, who sits at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d city, is assisted by four Sub-Judges. The Subordinate Judge at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d hears suits valued at more than Rs. 5,000 for the whole District, and he alone of the Subordinate Judges is vested with appellate powers. All the Subordinate Judges are empowered to hear \u2018small causes.\u2019 Two Joint Subordinate Judges sit, one at H\u0101la, the other at Naushahro, who hear such suits as may be transferred to them by the Subordinate\nJudges of those two places. The District Judge alone can hear suits to which Government or its officials are parties. The crimes most prevalent are cattle-stealing, theft, and burglary.\n\nThe land tenures are simple. Broadly speaking, all land is either 'assessed' or 'alienated.' In the former case, the land is cultivated sometimes by the zamindar himself, but usually by tenants-at-will, who for their labour receive a share of the produce. The occupancy holder (maurusi hari) is really a hereditary cultivator, for his rights are heritable and transferable; and the zamindar, except as regards the actual payment of rent, has no power over him. The tenant-at-will (ghair maurusi) is legally the creature of the zamindar, but the large landholders in the District do not exercise their powers oppressively. The zamindar's own tenure is hardly more definite here than elsewhere in India, and whatever of certainty it possesses is owing entirely to British legislation.\n\nIn the second class of lands (the 'alienated'), there are three chief varieties: namely, jagirs, charitable grants, and garden grants. The jagirs of the District at the first settlement under British rule were computed at 40 per cent. of the total area, but now only about 8 per cent. of the whole is 'alienated.' They are either permanent and heritable, or granted for two lives only, or merely life grants. The last class is rapidly disappearing. The grants are liable to a cess of 5 per cent. for local purposes, and some pay besides to Government a percentage of the produce assessed according to their class, the maximum being one-fourth. The total area held on charitable grants is very small. Garden grants are held free of assessment so long as the gardens are properly maintained.\n\nFormerly the Government assessment was levied in kind, but since 1851 payment has been received in cash. The land assessment is levied on survey numbers or fields when cultivated, according to rates fixed at the time of the settlement for each kind of irrigation. To prevent a zamindar holding more land than he can cultivate, he is required to pay at least one assessment in five years, whether the land be cultivated or not. The first survey was carried out between 1860 and 1865. The rates were subsequently revised every ten years, simultaneously with the expiry of the irrigation settlements. The latest settlement rates show an increase of 11 per cent. during the ten years ending 1901-2. The current rates per acre are: garden land, Rs. 3-4 (maximum Rs. 5-2, minimum Rs. 2-4); rice land, Rs. 3-2 (maximum Rs. 4-8, minimum Rs. 2-4); and 'dry' land, Rs. 2-1 (maximum Rs. 3-6, minimum Rs. 1-0).\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and revenue from all sources are given on the next page, in thousands of rupees.\n\nThe municipalities are seven in number, viz.: Hyderabad, Tando\nMuhammad Khan, Hala, Matiari, Tando Allahyar, Tando Adam, and Nasarpur. The local affairs of the District outside the municipalities are managed by the District board and twelve taluka boards, with receipts of 2.5 lakhs in 1903-4. Their expenditure in the same year amounted to 2.9 lakhs, of which 1.2 lakhs was spent on roads and buildings. The Local fund revenue is derived from the cess on land revenue, the 5 per cent. jagir cess, and other miscellaneous sources.\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 15.95  | 55.56  | 37.87  | 41.45  |\n| Total revenue  | 21.54  | 47.24  | 49.27  | 50.87  |\n\nThe police force is in charge of a District Superintendent, with head-quarters at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d city, and an Assistant Superintendent. There are 25 police stations and 66 outposts in the District. The number of police, including 4 inspectors, is 1,121, of whom 17 are chief constables, 217 head constables, and 883 constables.\n\nThe Central jail at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d city has accommodation for 865 prisoners, and the District jail at the same place has accommodation for 480. There are also eleven subsidiary jails in the District, in which 304 prisoners can be accommodated. An extra-mural gang of about 362 prisoners, in charge of an Assistant Surgeon, works in the District wherever its services are required. The daily average number of prisoners confined in 1904 was 1,040, of whom 12 were females.\n\nHyder\u0101b\u0101d stands twenty-first among the twenty-four Districts of the Presidency in regard to the literacy of its population, of whom 3.13 per cent. (5.4 males and 0.3 females) are able to read and write. In 1881 there were 98 schools with 5,501 pupils. The number of pupils rose to 14,342 in 1891 and to 19,481 in 1901. The District possessed 546 institutions in 1904. Of the 340 institutions classed as public, 4 are high schools, 7 middle schools, 322 primary schools, 3 training schools, and 4 other special schools. These were attended by 19,973 pupils (including 2,814 in private schools), of whom 2,733 were girls. Five are maintained by Government, 125 are managed by local boards, 20 by municipalities, 185 are aided and 5 unaided. The total expenditure on education is about 2\u00bd lakhs, of which Rs. 40,000 is derived from fees. Of the total amount, 55 per cent. is devoted to primary schools.\n\nThere are 17 dispensaries, one civil hospital, and one women's hospital, with accommodation for 169 patients. The number of patients treated in 1904 was 108,914, of whom 2,286 were in-patients, and 7,778 operations were performed. The total expenditure on these institutions, excluding one private dispensary, was Rs. 42,595, of which Rs. 28,144 was met from Local and municipal funds. A lunatic asylum,\nnamed after the donor, Sir Cowasji Jahangir, has accommodation for 170 patients, the number in 1904 being 153.\n\nThe number of persons successfully vaccinated in 1903-4 was 18,927, representing a proportion of 19 per 1,000, which is below the average for the Presidency.\n\n[A. W. Hughes, Gazetteer of the Province of Sind (1876).]\n\nHyderabad Taluka.\u2014Taluka of Hyderabad District, Sind, Bombay, lying between 25\u00b0 10' and 25\u00b0 33' N. and 68\u00b0 20' and 68\u00b0 45' E., with an area of 398 square miles. It contains one town, Hyderabad (population, 69,378), the District and taluka head-quarters; and 98 villages. The population in 1901 was 138,021, compared with 122,507 in 1891. The density, 347 persons per square mile, is largely above the District average. Land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to about 2 lakhs. A small limestone range, known as the Ganjo hills, runs nearly due south parallel to the Indus for about 14 miles. The taluka is compact in shape, and produces bajra, green gram, wheat, and cotton. It is irrigated wholly by canals.\n\nHyderabad City (Haidarabad).\u2014Headquarters of Hyderabad District, Sind, Bombay, situated in 25\u00b0 23' N. and 68\u00b0 25' E., on the North-Western Railway. Population: (1872) 43,088, (1881) 48,153, (1891) 58,048, and (1901) 69,378, including 4,588 in cantonments. Of the population in 1901, 24,831 were Muhammadans, 43,499 Hindus, and 710 Christians. The city ranks seventh in the Presidency in point of population. Upon the site of the present fort is supposed to have stood the ancient town of Nerankot, which in the eighth century submitted to Muhammad bin Kasim Sakifi. In 1768 the present city was founded by Ghulam Shah Kalhora; and it remained the chief town of Sind until 1843, when, after the battle of Miani, it surrendered to the British, and the capital was transferred to Karachi. The city is built on the most northerly hills of the Ganjo range, a site of great natural strength, 3\u00bd miles east of the Indus, with which it is connected by the high road to Gidu Bandar. In the fort, which covers an area of 36 acres, are the arsenal of the province, transferred hither from Karachi in 1861, and the palaces of the ex-Amirs of Sind. Besides 4 high schools with 1,319 pupils in 1903-4, Hyderabad contains a training college for males with an attached technical class (121 students), a normal class for females (3), a training college for mistresses (6), a midwifery school (3), an agricultural school (109), an engineering class (34), and a medical school (43). The total number of schools is 50, of which 6 are for girls. The city contains a civil hospital and a dispensary.\n\nHyderabad is now plentifully supplied with water, which is pumped up from the Indus by powerful machinery, located on the river bank at Gidu. Thence the water passes along an aqueduct raised on masonry\narches, into two large reservoirs or depositing tanks, situated about 500 yards from the river bank, each capable of holding over 1,000,000 gallons. From these tanks the water flows by gravitation to within a short distance of the foot of the rocky plateau on which the fort is built; from here the water is pumped up into a tank inside the fort, whence it is distributed to the city and cantonments by gravitation.\n\nHyder\u0101b\u0101d, as the historic capital of Sind, is the centre of all the provincial communications\u2014road, telegraphic, postal. From the date of its foundation (1768), its manufactures\u2014ornamented silks, silver- and gold-work, and lacquered ware\u2014have been the chief in the province, and during the last thirty years have gained prizes at the industrial exhibitions of Europe. The garrison is composed of British and Native infantry, 2 batteries of artillery, and an ammunition column. The barracks are built in twelve blocks, with hospitals, bazar, &c., to the north-west of the city. The only noteworthy antiquities are the tombs of the Kalhora and Talpur rulers. The Residency, memorable for its gallant defence by Sir James Outram against the Baluchis in 1843, which was situated 3 miles from Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, no longer exists.\n\nThe municipality was established in 1853, and had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 2\u00b72 lakhs. In 1903-4 the income and expenditure amounted to 2\u00b77 and 2\u00b78 lakhs respectively. The chief sources of income are octroi (Rs. 1,30,000) and water rate (Rs. 22,000); and the chief heads of expenditure are general administration and collection of taxes (Rs. 39,000), public safety (Rs. 7,400), water-supply and drainage (Rs. 22,000), conservancy (Rs. 37,000), hospitals and dispensaries (Rs. 15,000), public works (Rs. 13,000), and education (Rs. 18,000). The income of the cantonment fund in 1903-4 was Rs. 43,000, and the expenditure Rs. 33,800.\n\nHyl\u0101k\u0101ndi.\u2014Subdivision of C\u0101ch\u0101r District, Eastern Bengal and Assam.

See KOLH\u0100PUR STATE.\n\nIchalkaranji Town.\u2014Chief town of the feudatory j\u0101gir of the same name in Kolh\u0101pur State, Bombay, situated in 16\u00b0 41\u2032 N. and 74\u00b0 31\u2032 E., near the P\u0101nchganga river, about 18 miles east of Kolh\u0101pur city. Population (1901), 12,920. The town is administered as a municipality, with an income in 1903-4 of Rs. 4,500. The climate is healthy, but the water of the wells is brackish. Good drinking-water\nhas been brought in iron pipes from the P\u0101nchganga by the help of a steam pump raised on a tower built in the river. Every year in October a large fair attended by about 2,000 people is held in honour of Venkatesh, the guardian deity of the State.\n\nIch\u0101mat\u012b (1).\u2014River of P\u0101bna District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, which is mentioned in Martin's Eastern India in the description of Din\u0101jpur. It is now fed by the Ganges, from which it is given off about 7 miles south-east of P\u0101bna town, in $23^\\circ 56'$ N. and $89^\\circ 20'$ E. After passing P\u0101bna, it flows through the District by a tortuous route, and joins the Hur\u0101s\u0101gar a short distance below the confluence of that river with the Baral. During the rains it becomes a wide and beautiful stream, but for eight months in the year it is little more than a dry sandy bed. As shown in the maps of Major Rennell, it would appear at one time to have been connected with the Karatoy\u0101.\n\nIch\u0101mat\u012b (2).\u2014River of Nadi\u0101 District, Bengal. The Ich\u0101mat\u012b is in its present form a branch of the M\u0101t\u0101bh\u0101nga (an offshoot of the Ganges), which it leaves at Krishnaganj in $23^\\circ 24'$ N. and $88^\\circ 43'$ E. The Ich\u0101mat\u012b flows south till it enters the Twenty-four Parganas, where it takes the name of Jamuna (2). It is a deep river, navigable throughout the year by the largest trading boats. It was probably at one time a main outlet of the Ganges when it was forcing its way eastwards, and was possibly part of an older stream which was cut in half by that river, there being another river of the same name\u2014Ich\u0101mat\u012b (1)\u2014on the north bank of the Ganges in P\u0101bna District.\n\nIch\u0101mat\u012b (3).\u2014River of Dacca District, Eastern Bengal and Assam. It flows through the south of the District, entering the Meghn\u0101 near Munshiganj. This even within historical times was a large stream, and has no less than five sacred bathing gh\u0101ts on its banks, at which the bathing ceremony takes place at the full moon in the month of K\u0101rtik, when a similar ceremony is performed on the Karatoy\u0101. This Ich\u0101mat\u012b seems to have been at one period, like the Ich\u0101mat\u012b (2) of Nadi\u0101 and Jessore, a continuation of the North Bengal Ich\u0101mat\u012b (1), from which it was cut off by the Dhaleswari.\n\n[For a discussion of the history of this river, see paragraph 22, Report on the System of Agriculture and Agricultural Statistics of the Dacca District, by A.

The population in 1901 was 83,500, compared with 74,846 in 1891. They live in 266 villages. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 61,200. The head-quarters are at Ichch\u0101puram Town, which lies outside the tahsil in the adjoining Government taluk of Berhampur. Of the principal estates in it, Chikati is open, well cultivated, and irrigated by the\nBahud\u0101 river, while Surangi and Jarada largely consist of hill and jungle.\n\nIchch\u0101puram Town ('City of desire').\u2014Town in the Berhampur taluk of Ganj\u0101m District, Madras, situated in $19^\\circ 7'$ N. and $84^\\circ 42'$ E., on the trunk road and on the East Coast Railway, 15 miles south-west of Berhampur. Population (1901), 9,975. It was formerly the headquarters of the Ichch\u0101puram district of Chicacole Sark\u0101r, and the seat of the Muhammadan Naib. Some small mosques in ruins alone remain. To one of these followers of the Prophet come from distant places for prayer. The place is now the head-quarters of a deputy-tahs\u012bld\u0101r.\n\nIchh\u0101war.\u2014Town in the Niz\u0101mat-i-Maghrib or western district of Bhop\u0101l State, Central India, situated in $23^\\circ 2'$ N. and $77^\\circ 1'$ E. Population (1901), 4,352. The site is an old one, the present town having been built on the foundations of the village of Lakshmipura. A small fort in the place was built by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, who seized it in 1716. Ichh\u0101war was made over to the Bhop\u0101l State under the treaty of 1818. The Ichh\u0101war tahs\u012bl was for many years held in j\u0101g\u012br by the Bhop\u0101l Bourbons, who have given a succession of shrewd councillors and valiant soldiers to the State. About 1560 Jean Philippe Bourbon of Navarre, a cousin of Henry IV, came to India. He entered the service of Akbar, married Juliana, said to have been a sister of Akbar's 'Christian wife,' and was created a Naw\u0101b. The family continued in the service of the Delhi emperors till 1739, when on the sack of that city by N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h they fled to the fort of Shergarh ($25^\\circ 35'$ N. and $77^\\circ 58'$ E.), which they held in j\u0101g\u012br in the territory of the Narwar chief. The family remained in Narwar in safety till 1778, when the R\u0101j\u0101, who was jealous of his powerful feudatory, attacked Shergarh and massacred all but four of the family, who managed to escape to Gwalior. After the capture of Gwalior in 1780 by Major Popham, some territory was assigned to them, and soon after Salvador Bourbon took service in the Bhop\u0101l State, and became a general in the State army. Salvador's son Balthasar was minister to Waz\u012br Mu\u1e25ammad, and was instrumental in concluding the treaty of 1818 with the British Government, he being one of the signatories. During the Mutiny of 1857 the fugitives from Agar were hospitably received by Jean de Silva and several of the Bourbon family who were then residing in the town. Members of the family still live in the State.\n\nIdak.\u2014Village in the Daur valley, in the Northern Wazirist\u0101n Agency, North-West Frontier Province, situated in $32^\\circ 57'$ N. and $70^\\circ 15'$ E., on the left bank of the Tochi river, 28 miles west of Bannu. Its inhabitants belong to the Idak subdivision of the Tappiz\u0101d Dauris. About $1\\frac{1}{2}$ miles north-east of the village is a post garrisoned by the Northern Wazirist\u0101n militia.\n\n1 *Asiatic Quarterly Review*, 1887.\nIdar State.\u2014Principal Rajput State of the Mahi Kantha Agency, Bombay, lying between $23^\\circ 6'$ and $24^\\circ 29'$ N. and $72^\\circ 45'$ and $73^\\circ 39'$ E., with an area of 1,669 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Sirohi and Udaipur; on the east by Dungarpur; and on the south and west by the Bombay Presidency and the territories of the Gaikwar of Baroda. In the south-west lies a level and sandy tract, but elsewhere the country is broken up by wild hills covered with an abundance of trees and brushwood. Except during the hot season the scenery is very beautiful. Idar is well drained by the Sabarmati, Hathmati, Meshwa, Majam, and Vatrak rivers.\n\nTradition relates that from 800 to 970 Idar was under Gahlot rule, and, after a period of Bhil independence, was subject to Paramara Rajputs (1000-1200). Amar Singh, the last Paramara ruler, left Idar in the hands of his servant Hathi Sord, a Koli, who held the country till his death, and was succeeded by his son Samalio Sord. The latter, a debauched and vicious man, roused so much discontent that his ministers conspired against him, and invited Rao Sonang of Sametra, the ancestor of the Raos of Pol, to their aid. This chief killed Samalio Sord, and took possession of his territory. About twelve generations of this family are reckoned to the expulsion of Jagannath, the last Rao of Idar, in 1656, by Murad Baksh, at that time the Subahdar of Gujarat. A desai or deputy was afterwards placed in charge of Idar for some years. In 1728 Anand Singh and Rai Singh, two brothers of the Raja of Jodhpur, accompanied by a few horsemen from Vamo and Palanpur and the Kolis of Godwara, established themselves in Idar without much difficulty. This family is the last that effected a settlement in Gujarat by conquest. They are said to have acted under an order from Delhi; but the truth seems to be that they were tempted by the state of the country, and most likely assisted by the Jodhpur princes who at that period held the Subahdari of Ahmadabad. The Idar principality consisted of the districts of Idar, Ahmadnagar, Modasa, Bayad, Harso, Parantij, and Vijapur, to which five other districts were rendered tributary. Some years after the conquest, at the instigation of the desai above mentioned, who appears to have been displaced, an officer in the service of Damaji Gaikwar, named Bachaji Duvaji, was dispatched on the part of the Peshwa to take possession of Idar. This he accomplished with the aid of the Rehwari Rajputs, the servants of the late Rao. Anand Singh was killed about 1753; and Bachaji, after leaving a detachment behind, returned to Ahmadabad. Rai Singh, however, collected a force, and again obtained possession of Idar. Shiv Singh, son of Anand Singh, now became ruler under the guardianship of his uncle Rai Singh, who died in 1766. During the rule of Shiv Singh the State was stripped, by the Peshwa, of Parantij, Vijapur, and half of the three districts\nof Mod\u0101sa, B\u0101yad, and Harsol, which districts were afterwards ceded by the Peshw\u0101 to the British Government. The other half of the Idar territories fell to the Gaikw\u0101r, who contented himself with the exaction of a share of the revenues, fixed in perpetuity by the settlement of 1812 at Rs. 24,000 for Idar, and Rs. 8,950 for Ahmadnagar. Shiv Singh died in 1791, leaving five sons, the eldest of whom, Bhaw\u0101n Singh, succeeded him, but died in a few days, leaving the State to his son Gambh\u012br Singh, a boy of ten. Dissensions in the family now arose, which resulted in the temporary dismemberment of Idar. Sangr\u0101m Singh, second son of Shiv Singh, who had received Ahmadnagar from his father in feudal grant, assumed independence; and with his assistance Z\u0101lim Singh and Amir Singh, two other sons of Shiv Singh, after a long struggle possessed themselves respectively of Mod\u0101sa and B\u0101yad during Gambh\u012br Singh's minority. Indra Singh, the fifth son of Shiv Singh, who was blind, received Sur and three other villages for his support. Sangr\u0101m Singh, chief of Ahmadnagar, died in 1798, and was succeeded by his son Karan Singh. Z\u0101lim Singh of Mod\u0101sa died childless in 1806, and his apanage ought to have lapsed to Idar. His widow, however, was allowed by the Gaikw\u0101r to adopt Prat\u0101p Singh, Karan Singh's brother, on whose death in 1821 Mod\u0101sa was united with Ahmadnagar. On the death of Am\u012br Singh of B\u0101yad without children, the reversion was claimed by both Idar and Ahmadnagar. The chief of Ahmadnagar, Karan Singh, died in 1835, and was succeeded by his son Takht Singh, who was elected ruler of the State of Jodhpur in 1843. On his removal to Jodhpur, he still claimed the right to retain Ahmadnagar in his family; but in 1848 the British Government decided that Ahmadnagar should revert to Idar, and with it Mod\u0101sa and B\u0101yad. The chief, who is styled Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101, is a R\u0101jput of the R\u0101thor clan and of the Joda family. He holds a sanad granting the right of adoption and is entitled to a salute of 15 guns. The present Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 is Major-General Sir Prat\u0101p Singh, G.C.S.I., K.C.B., Aide-de-camp to His Majesty the King-Emperor.\n\nThe population of the State was 217,382 in 1872, 258,429 in 1881, 302,134 in 1891, and 168,557 in 1901. The decrease of 44 per cent. during the last decade is due to the severity of the famine of 1899\u20131900. The number of towns and villages was returned in 1901 as 884. The density of population is 101 persons per square mile. The chief towns are Ahmadnagar (population, 3,200), the capital, Idar (7,085), and Vad\u0101li (4,611). Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 156,948, Muhammadans 8,200, and Jains 4,376. The majority of the population are Kolis, the remainder consisting of R\u0101jputs, Br\u0101hmans, Ban\u012b\u0101s, Kunbis, Bhils, &c.\n\nThe soil of the State is generally fertile; in some places it is of a light sandy nature, in others rich and black: towards the north and\nnorth-eastern parts near the hills, poor and stony. Nearly 17 per cent. of the land is cultivated. The principal crops are grains, oilseeds, and sugar-cane. The jungle in some parts, particularly at the foot of the hills, is very thick and intersected with ravines. A small quantity of country soap is manufactured. There are quarries in the neighbourhood of Ahmadnagar, and the stone is used for building purposes. The State suffered very severely in the famine of 1899-1900.\n\nThe chief exercises first-class jurisdiction, having power to inflict capital punishment. Many relatives of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101, and feudal chiefs whose ancestors helped to secure the country for the present dynasty, now enjoy large estates on service tenures, and there are numerous petty chiefs or bh\u016bmi\u0101s who have held considerable estates from the time of the Raos of Idar, or earlier, and are under no obligation of service. The revenues of the State are shared by the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 with these feudal chiefs. In 1903-4, out of a total gross revenue of nearly 6 lakhs, it was estimated that only 4\u00bd lakhs was received by the central authority. The chief sources of revenue are the land, stamps, and special cesses known as dan, khichadi, &c., and the chief heads of expenditure are classed under administration and darb\u012br expenses. The Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 receives about Rs. 8,600 annually from several chiefs in Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101, and pays Rs. 30,340 as tribute to the Gaikw\u0101r of Baroda through the British Government. Many chiefs subordinate to Idar, known locally as patt\u0101wals, hold their estates on condition of military service, the quota being three horsemen for every 1,000 rupees of revenue; but for many years this service has not been exacted and no military force is maintained at present. In 1903-4 the State contained 21 courts for criminal justice, and maintained a police force of 91 mounted men and 539 foot, at an annual cost of Rs. 76,000. Besides these, 36 mounted men and 150 foot are maintained at a cost of Rs. 10,800 in the territories of the bh\u016bmi\u0101s. There were 49 schools in the same year with 2,473 pupils, of which 7 were girls' schools. The total expenditure on education, excluding schools in Sard\u0101rs' villages, was Rs. 11,330. There are also 3 missionary schools with 106 pupils. An attempt to induce the Bhils to send their children to school has failed; they laughingly say their sons must learn to drive cattle and use the bow. The State contains a hospital and six dispensaries, treating annually 19,000 patients.\n\n**Idar Town.**\u2014Formerly the capital of the State of Idar, in the Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101 Agency, Bombay, situated in 23\u00b0 50' N. and 73\u00b0 4' E., 64 miles north-east of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d. The town is traditionally known as Ildurg. Population (1901), 7,085. Idar is surrounded by a brick wall in fair preservation, through which a road passes by a stone gateway, marked with many red hands each recording a victim to the rite of sat\u012b. In the vicinity are some cave-temples supposed to be\nupwards of four hundred years old. The town contains a dispensary, and is administered as a municipality with an income (1903-4) of Rs. 1,348 and expenditure of Rs. 803.\n\n**Igatpuri Taluka.**\u2014Taluka of Nasik District, Bombay, lying between 19\u00b0 35' and 19\u00b0 55' N. and 73\u00b0 25' and 73\u00b0 50' E., with an area of 393 square miles. It contains one town, Igatpuri (population, 7,436), the head-quarters; and 127 villages. The population in 1901 was 66,462, compared with 69,543 in 1891. The density, 169 persons per square mile, is much above the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was one lakh, and for cesses Rs. 7,000. In the north-west and in the south the country is hilly. The line of natural drainage divides it into two parts: a small section in the north and north-west that slopes west to the Vaitarna, and a larger section in the south that drains east into the Darna. The taluka is rather bare of trees except in the north-east and west, and the soil is poor and shallow. The climate is cool and healthy, the rainfall, which averages 133 inches annually, being the highest in the District. The water-supply is poor. Nagli is the chief cereal grown.\n\n**Igatpuri Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in Nasik District, Bombay, situated in 19\u00b0 42' E. and 73\u00b0 34' N., on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, 35 miles south-west of Nasik and 85 miles from Bombay. Population (1901), 7,436. Igatpuri is a military station of the Poona division of the Western Command. It stands at the head of the Thal Pass, 1,992 feet above sea-level. Half a mile to the north-east is a reservoir. The railway station includes a locomotive workshop. Pimpri, near Igatpuri, contains the tomb of Sadr-ud-din, a Muhammadan saint of great local sanctity; and Tringalvadi, 3 miles to the north, has a fort, cave-temples, and a ruined shrine of Brahmdeo. Igatpuri was constituted a municipality in 1868. The municipal income during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 12,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 8,000. The town contains five English schools, of which one is for European and Eurasian girls; and two dispensaries, one of which belongs to the railway company.\n\n**Iggutappadevarbetta.**\u2014Lofty mountain in the Padinalknad taluk of Coorg, Southern India, situated in 12\u00b0 17' N. and 75\u00b0 38' E., near the Paditora pass, sacred to the god Iggutappa.\n\n**Iglas.**\u2014Central western tahsil of Aligarh District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Hasangarh and Gorai, and lying between 27\u00b0 35' and 27\u00b0 55' N. and 77\u00b0 47' and 78\u00b0 3' E., with an area of 213 square miles. Population increased from 107,227 in 1891 to 118,803 in 1901. There are 209 villages and one town, Beswan (population, 2,871). The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 2,06,000, and for cesses Rs. 49,000. The tahsil is intersected by\nhigh ridges of sandy soil with good loam between. There is no canal-irrigation, and well-irrigation has become more difficult of late years owing to a fall in the spring-level. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 187 square miles, of which only 78 were irrigated.\n\n**Ijpura.**\u2014Petty State in Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\n**Ikkeri.**\u2014Village in the S\u0101gar taluk of Shimoga District, Mysore, situated in 14\u00b0 7' N. and 75\u00b0 1' E., 3 miles south of S\u0101gar town. Population (1901), 205. Ikkeri ('the two streets') was from about 1560 to 1640 the capital of the Keladi chiefs, afterwards removed to Bedn\u016br. Ikkeri continued, however, to be the nominal capital, the R\u0101j\u0101s were called by its name, and the coins were called Ikkeri pagodas and fanams, although the mint was removed. The walls were of great extent, forming three concentric enclosures. In the citadel was the palace, of mud and timber, adorned with carving and false gilding. The only building now remaining is the Aghoresvara temple. On the floor in front of the shrine are effigies of three of the kings, doing obeisance, with their names over each. Huchcha ('mad') Somasekhara is represented as manacled and fettered. The space between the central pillars, 18\u00bd feet, was the standard measure for garden land.\n\n**Il\u0101m B\u0101z\u0101r.**\u2014Village in the head-quarters subdivision of Birbh\u016bm District, Bengal, situated in 23\u00b0 38' N. and 87\u00b0 32' E., on the banks of the Ajay river. Population (1901), 1,815. It is the seat of a considerable trade, and is celebrated for its manufacture of lac ornaments and toys, tasar silk, and brass-ware.\n\n**Illichpur.**\u2014District, taluk, and town in Ber\u0101r. See Ellichpur.\n\n**Ilkal.**\u2014Town in the Hungund taluka of Bij\u0101pur District, Bombay, situated in 15\u00b0 57' N. and 76\u00b0 7' E., 8 miles south-east of Hungund. Population (1901), 9,019. The municipality was created in 1868, and had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 7,700. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 6,400. A large masonry embankment was constructed in 1886, at a cost of Rs. 15,700, to protect the town from floods. Ilkal is the principal market-town of the taluka and a centre of the weaving and dyeing industries; the staple exports are silk and cotton manufactures and agricultural produce. Cotton cloth, manufactured into s\u0101ris for women's dress, is exported to Shol\u0101pur, Poona, Belgaum, and the Niz\u0101m's Dominions. There are three modern temples. A yearly fair is held in honour of B\u0101nshankari on the full moon of Paush (January\u2013February). The town contains a dispensary.\n\n**Ilol.**\u2014Petty State in Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\n**Imphal.**\u2014Capital of the State of Manipur, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 24\u00b0 49' N. and 93\u00b0 57' E. A cart-road connects Imphal with Kohim\u0101 and the Brahmaputra Valley, and bridle-paths\ncross the hills that separate Manipur from Cachar and Burma. The population in 1901 was 67,093, of whom nearly 96 per cent. were Hindus. The history of Imphal cannot be distinguished from that of the Manipur State, but of recent years it has been notorious owing to the outbreak that occurred there in 1891. A palace revolution had taken place, the Raja had fled from the country, and the Chief Commissioner, Mr. Quinton, had proceeded to Manipur to settle the newly appointed ruler on the throne, and to arrest the Senapati who was the original instigator of the revolution. The Senapati declined to obey the summons of the Chief Commissioner, and the troops sent to arrest him were fiercely attacked. The engagement continued till the evening, when an armistice was agreed to, and the Chief Commissioner, with four officers, entered the Raja\u2019s fort under a safe-conduct. The Manipuris, however, broke faith, the Political Agent was speared, and the Chief Commissioner and his three companions formally beheaded by the public executioner. The attack on the Residency was then resumed; and the defenders, thinking it untenable, retreated to Cachar. A few weeks afterwards Imphal was re-entered by three columns of troops and satisfaction exacted for the outrage.\n\nThough containing a large population, Imphal is an overgrown village rather than a town in the ordinary sense of the word, and more than half the working males are dependent on agriculture for their support. Three rivers converge at this point; and along the banks of each river is a single row of cottages, each standing in a garden about half an acre in extent and buried in dense groves of bamboos and fruit trees. Viewed from above, the town has the appearance of a dense forest with a large square clearing in the centre. In this clearing are situated the palace of the Raja, the cantonments and offices, and the houses of the European residents. The town contains a small jail with accommodation for 100 prisoners, and a hospital with 14 beds. The rainfall is moderate (70 inches), and as Imphal lies about 2,000 feet above the sea, the climate is cool and pleasant. The daily bazar held in the town is the great centre of trade for the valley. Drinking-water is usually obtained from the rivers, which are exposed to every form of pollution, and outbreaks of cholera are frequent and severe.\n\nIndapur Taluka.\u2014Taluka of Poona District, Bombay, lying between 17\u00b0 54' and 18\u00b0 20' N. and 74\u00b0 39' and 75\u00b0 10' E., with an area of 567 square miles. It contains one town, Indapur (population, 5,533), its head-quarters; and 85 villages. The population in 1901 was 66,895, compared with 70,986 in 1891. The density, 118 persons per square mile, is much below the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was 1.1 lakhs, and for cesses\nRs. 7,500. The country is hilly and rugged in the north-west and centre, but towards the rivers it is open and smooth. The soils are extremely shallow and stony. As regards rainfall, Indapur is one of the worst-placed talukas in the Deccan, the annual average being only about 20 inches.\n\n**Indapur Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in Poona District, Bombay, situated in $18^\\circ 7'$ N. and $75^\\circ 2'$ E., 84 miles south-east of Poona city. Population (1901), 5,533. A weekly market and a fair, attended by Muhammadans, is held annually in November. The municipality, established in 1865, had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 3,900. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 3,900. The town has a dispensary, established in 1870, and is celebrated for the manufacture of coarse cotton cloth. There are two schools, one for boys with 216 pupils, and one for girls with 36.\n\n**Indarpat.**\u2014Village in Delhi District, Punjab, occupying the site of the ancient Indraprastha, and situated in $28^\\circ 36'$ N. and $77^\\circ 17'$ E., close to the modern city of Delhi. The original town stood upon the banks of the Jumna, between the Kotila of Firoz Shah and the tomb of Humayun; and although the river has now shifted its channel a mile eastward, the former bed may still be traced past the early site. Scarcely a stone of the ancient capital remains standing; but the village of Indarpat and the Muhammadan fort of Purana Kila probably occupy the true site, while the modern name is obviously a corruption of the old Hindu name. Indraprastha is commonly believed to have been founded by the earliest Aryan colonists of India; and the Mahabharata relates how the five Pandavas, Yudhisthira and his brethren, leading a body of settlers from Hastinapur on the Ganges, expelled the savage Nagas, and built their capital upon this spot. For later details see Delhi City.\n\n**Indaw** (formerly Manle).\u2014Central township of Katha District, Upper Burma, lying between $23^\\circ 57'$ and $24^\\circ 23'$ N. and $95^\\circ 58'$ and $96^\\circ 16'$ E., on either side of the Sagaing-Myitkyina railway, with an area of 416 square miles. The population was 11,291 in 1891, and 14,208 in 1901, distributed in 151 villages. The head-quarters are at Indaw (population, 470), on the railway. The township is watered by the Meza river. In some parts there are wide plains, affording scope for large expansion of cultivation. The township contained 18 square miles under cultivation in 1903-4, and the land revenue and thatahameda amounted to Rs. 49,200.\n\n**Indawgyi.**\u2014Lake in the south-west of Myitkyina District, Upper Burma, lying between $25^\\circ 5'$ and $25^\\circ 20'$ N. and $96^\\circ 18'$ and $96^\\circ 23'$ E., and measuring about 16 miles by 6. It is the largest lake in Burma. It is surrounded by low hills on the south, east, and west; and its\noverflow, known as the Indaw stream, flows first north-eastward and then south-eastward into the Mogaung, which enters the Irrawaddy some distance south of Myitkyin\u0101. The lake abounds in fish, and the valley surrounding it is fertile.\n\n**Indhy\u0101dri.**\u2014Hill range in Bombay, Ber\u0101r, and Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. See Ajanta.\n\n**Indi Taluka.**\u2014Northernmost taluka of Bij\u0101pur District, Bombay, lying between 16\u00b0 56\u2032 and 17\u00b0 29\u2032 N. and 75\u00b0 33\u2032 and 76\u00b0 12\u2032 E., with an area of 838 square miles. It contains 121 villages, but no town, the head-quarters being at the village of Indi. The population in 1901 was 75,961, compared with 92,479 in 1891. The rate of decrease was very high, and the density of population is lower than in other talukas, owing to the poverty of the soil. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was 2.03 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 15,000. Indi is an unbroken and almost treeless plain. Towards the south and south-east near Hutturki, T\u0101mba, and Shirshad, and along the streams running by those villages, the country is populous and well cultivated and the villages are comparatively rich. The annual rainfall averages nearly 25 inches.\n\n**Indi Village.**\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in Bij\u0101pur District, Bombay, situated in 17\u00b0 11\u2032 N. and 76\u00b0 E., on the Southern Mahrratta Railway. Population (1901), 4,427. In the Bh\u012bma M\u0101h\u0101tmya Indi is described as the Paya Kshetra, or \u2018milk spot,\u2019 and Palei was known as Chik Indi, or \u2018little Indi.\u2019 Its origin is connected by a tradition with the discovery of a sacred lingam through a cow giving milk at the spot where the lingam lay buried. There is a shrine of Kanteshwar or Shanteshwar at Indi. In 1790 it was the chief town of a subdivision in the Bij\u0101pur sark\u0101r. The village contains a dispensary, two boys\u2019 schools with 204 pupils, and a girls\u2019 school with 31.\n\n**Indore Residency.**\u2014A Political Charge in Central India, created in 1818. In 1854 the appointment of Resident at Indore was merged in that of the Agent to the Governor-General for Central India, who continued to hold direct charge of portions of the Indore State in addition to the superior control of the whole Agency. It was found necessary in 1899 to appoint a separate officer to the political charge of the Indore State. The Resident now holds charge of the whole State, except the parganas of Law\u0101ni, Chikalda, and Petlawad, which are under the Political Agent in Bhop\u0101war; Talen and Sundars\u012b, under the Political Agent, Bhop\u0101l; Nandw\u0101s (or Nandwai), under the Mew\u0101r Residency, R\u0101jput\u0101na; and Alampur, under the Political Agent in Bundelkhand.\n\nThe Residency has an area of 8,960 square miles, and a population (1901) of 833,410, of whom Hindus number 662,888, or 79 per cent.: Musalm\u0101ns, 77,825; Animists, 73,638; Jains, 13,487; and Christians,\nThe density of population is 93 persons per square mile. The chief towns are INDORE CITY (population, including the Agent to the Governor-General's Camp or Residency limits, 97,804), the cantonment of MHOW (36,039), R\u0100MPURA (8,273), KHARGON (7,624), MAHESHWAR (7,042), MEHIDPUR (6,681), BARW\u0100HA (6,094), BH\u0100NPURA (4,639), and TAR\u0100NA (4,490). There are also 3,089 villages in the charge. The Resident has his head-quarters in the Agent to the Governor-General's Camp at Indore city.\n\nIndore State (Ind\u016br).\u2014Native State in the Central India Agency, under the Resident at Indore, lying between 21\u00b0 22' and 26\u00b0 3' N. and 74\u00b0 30' and 78\u00b0 51' E., with an area of 9,500 square miles, including the isolated pargana of Nandw\u0101s or Nandwai (area 36 square miles), which lies geographically in R\u0101jput\u0101na. It is bounded on the north by Gwalior State; on the east by the States of Dew\u0101s and Dh\u0101r and the Nim\u0101r District of the Central Provinces; on the south by the Kh\u0101ndesh District of the Bombay Presidency; and on the west by the States of Barw\u0101ni and Dh\u0101r. The State takes its name from its capital, originally the small village of Indreshwar or Indore, which was first raised to a place of importance in the eighteenth century, and after 1818 became the permanent seat of the Holkar family.\n\nThe State is formed of several detached tracts, of which the largest and most compact lies south of the Narbad\u0101 river. These tracts may be conveniently divided into two main sections, which correspond to the natural divisions of the plateau and the hilly tract. The plateau section comprises the portion which lies in M\u0101lw\u0101 proper, and is included in the R\u0100MPURA-BH\u0100NPURA, MEHIDPUR, and INDORE districts. The country in this section, except for the range lying north of R\u0101mpura and some scattered hills in the Mehidpur district and Petl\u0101wad pargana, is typical of M\u0100LW\u0100 generally. The hilly tract, which comprises the Nim\u0101r and Nem\u0101war districts, lies partly on and partly south of the great Vindhyan scarp, the Nim\u0101r district including also a portion of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 range. The plateau section has an area of 4,320 square miles, the hilly tract an area of 5,143 square miles. Besides these two sections, the small isolated pargana of ALAMPUR in Bundelkhand, with an area of 37 square miles, owes its existence solely to the presence in it of the cenotaph of Malh\u0101r Rao Holkar. The great Vindhyan range, which almost bisects the State, determines its watershed. All the streams north of this barrier flow towards the Jumna-Ganges do\u0101b, the chief stream being the CHAMBAL, with its tributaries, the SIPIRA and lesser and greater KAL\u012a SIND. To the south of the Vindhyas lies the NARBAD\u0100 river, with its numerous tributaries.\n\nPhysical aspects.\n\n1 Very little is known concerning the geology of the territories that\n\n1 By Mr. E. Vredenburg, Geological Survey of India.\nconstitute Holkar's dominions. The principal rock in M\u0101lwa is Deccan trap, weathering superficially into the black soil to which the region owes its great fertility. Near R\u0101mpura, east of Nimach, Vindhyan rocks of both upper and lower series are exposed, in addition to the Deccan trap. The districts south of the Narbad\u0101, largely occupied by the northern spurs of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 Hills, consist principally of Deccan trap. North of the Narbad\u0101, the denudation of the Deccan trap has proceeded far enough to bring into view an interesting sequence of the underlying rocks, including gneiss, Bij\u0101wars, and Lametas. Gneiss occupies a large portion of the Nem\u0101war district, being overlaid, north of Ch\u0101ndgarh, by Bij\u0101war and Vindhyan strata. Between K\u0101tk\u016bt and the Kan\u0101r river and at other places near Barw\u0101ha, peculiar fault breccias occur either within the Bij\u0101war outcrop, or separating the Bij\u0101wars from the Vindh yans. The matrix of the breccia is usually siliceous, but often contains a large admixture of hematite. Strata belonging to the Lameta or infra-trappean group cover a large area around K\u0101tk\u016bt. They are mostly sandstones underlaid by conglomerates. Round K\u0101tk\u016bt the Lameta beds are unfossiliferous and probably of fresh-water origin; but north of Barw\u0101ha, at the Gh\u0101\u1e6dia quarries, the conglomerate underlying the sandstone contains marine fossils identical with those found in the cretaceous limestones east of B\u0101gh known as the B\u0101gh beds. The exposure at the Gh\u0101\u1e6dia quarry marks the easternmost limit reached by the sea in which the B\u0101gh beds were deposited.\n\nThe Lameta group contains excellent building stones. The sandstone quarries at Gh\u0101\u1e6dia north of Barw\u0101ha, and those situated on the banks of the Kan\u0101r river, east of K\u0101tk\u016bt, have supplied a great deal of the material used for constructing the Holkar State Railway. One of the limestones is a rock made up of fragments of marine organisms resembling corals, known for that reason as coralline limestone. It constitutes a stone of great beauty, which has been largely used in the ancient buildings of M\u0101ndu, for which it was obtained from the old quarries near Chir\u0101kh\u0101n. This locality has been famous geologically since 1856, owing to the discovery there by Colonel Keatinge of the Cretaceous fossils which settled the age of the B\u0101gh beds.\n\nThe low rocky hills of northern Indore often bear a stunted jungle containing Butea frondosa, Acacia arabica, A. Catechu, and A. leucophloea, and many shrubs, such as species of Grewia, Zizyphus, Capparis, Carissa, and Tamarix. In places where the forest is taller, the leading species are Bombax malabaricum, Sterculia urens, Anogeissus latifolia and A. pendula, Dichrostachys, Prosopis, and species of Cordia. Farther south are tracts with principally salai (Boswellia serrata) and a thin scrub jungle of Flueggea, Phyllanthus, Antidesma, and similar shrubs. Still farther south occur typical forests of the Central Indian highland class, with teak, s\u0101j (Terminalia tomentosa),\ntendu (*Diospyros tomentosa*), black-wood (*Dalbergia latifolia*), *tinis* (*Ougeinia dalbergioides*), *anjan* (*Hardwickia binata*), and similar species.\n\nAll the ordinary wild animals are met with, including tigers, leopards, bears, hyenas, *sambhar*, *chital*, and antelope. Bison (*Bos gaurus*) and wild buffalo (*Bubalus arni*) were formerly plentiful in the S\u0101tpur\u0101 region, but are now almost, if not quite, extinct. In the Mughal period elephants were caught in the Bij\u0101garh and Satw\u0101s forests. Small game is plentiful throughout the State.\n\nThe climate in M\u0101lw\u0101 is temperate: the temperature varies in the hot season from $46^\\circ$ to $110^\\circ$ and in the cold season from $40^\\circ$ to $90^\\circ$. In the districts south of the Vindhyan scarp, however, much higher temperatures are met with, while the cold season is of short duration. The annual rainfall on the plateau area averages 30 inches, and in the hilly tract 40 inches.\n\nThe Holkars belong to the Dhangar or shepherd caste. Their ancestors are said to have migrated southwards to the Deccan from the region round Muttra, and to have settled at the village of Hal or Hol on the N\u012bra river, 40 miles from Poona, whence they take their family name. Malh\u0101r Rao Holkar, the founder of the house of Indore, was born in 1694, being the only son of Khandoji, a simple peasant. On the death of his father, he and his mother went to live in Kh\u0101ndesh with N\u0101r\u0101yanj\u012b, his mother's brother, a man of some property, who maintained a body of horse for his overlord Sard\u0101r Kadam B\u0101nde. Malh\u0101r Rao was enrolled in this body of horse, and at the same time married his uncle's daughter, Gautama Bai. His soldierly qualities rapidly brought him to the front, and attracted the notice of the Peshw\u0101, who in 1724 took him into his service and gave him the command of 500 horse. Sard\u0101r Kadam was delighted at the young man's prowess, and permitted him to assume and fly at the head of his body of horse the banner of the B\u0101nde family, a triangular red and white striped flag, to this day the ensign of the Holkar house. In 1728 he received a grant of 12 districts in M\u0101lw\u0101, increased to 82 in 1731. Previous to this he had acquired land south of the Narbad\u0101, including the town of Maheshwar, which practically remained the capital of the Holkar dominions until 1818, as Indore, acquired in 1733, did not become the real administrative capital until after the Treaty of Mandasor. Malh\u0101r Rao at this time possessed territory yielding an income of $74\\frac{1}{2}$ lakhs a year, the Peshw\u0101 honouring him with the title of *S\u016bbahd\u0101r* of M\u0101lw\u0101. He was continually employed in the Peshw\u0101's conquests, against the Niz\u0101m (1738), the Portuguese at Bassein (1739), and the Rohillas (1751); and his influence and possessions increased rapidly. In 1761 came the disastrous battle of P\u0101nipat, which broke the Mar\u0101th\u0101 power for\nThus Malh\u0101r Rao, from being the son of a small peasant, had become at sixty-seven the holder of vast territories stretching from the Deccan to the Ganges. After the flight from P\u0101nipat, he proceeded to establish and consolidate his power in his possessions. Death, however, overtook him suddenly at Alampur on May 2, 1766. Malh\u0101r Rao was primarily a soldier, and in no way the equal of his contemporary Mah\u0101dj\u012b Sindhia as a politician; but his courage was unsurpassed, and his disregard of money proverbial. He had one son, Khande Rao, who was killed in 1754. Khande Rao's son, M\u0101le Rao, was a boy of weak intellect. He was allowed to succeed, but soon showed by his excesses that he was unfit to rule, and died a raving madman in 1767. His mother, Ahaly\u0101 Bai, refused to adopt an heir and personally assumed charge of the administration of the State. The Peshw\u0101's uncle, Raghuba, who was then in Central India, wished to compel her to adopt; but Mah\u0101dj\u012b Sindhia supported Ahaly\u0101 Bai, and her position was at length recognized. She selected Tukoji Rao Holkar, a member of the same clan but not related to the ruling family, to bear titular honours and command her armies. He was a simple soldier, and served Ahaly\u0101 Bai with unswerving loyalty until her death.\n\nThe administration of Ahaly\u0101 Bai is still looked upon in Central India as that of a model ruler. Her toleration, justice, and careful management of all the departments of the State were soon shown in the increased prosperity of her dominions, and the peace which ruled throughout her days. Her charities, which extended all over India, and include buildings at Badr\u012bn\u0101th, Gay\u0101, and R\u0101meswaram, are proverbial. It was during her rule that the Holkar Darb\u0101r first employed regular battalions under Chevalier Dudrenee, Boyd, and others.\n\nOn the death of Ahaly\u0101 Bai in 1795, Tukoji Rao succeeded. Mah\u0101dj\u012b Sindhia had died in 1794, and Tukoji, now seventy years of age, was looked up to as the leading Mar\u0101th\u0101 chief. He followed in the steps of Ahaly\u0101 Bai, and during his life the prosperity of the State continued. Politically, he acted as a check on the youthful and warlike Daulat Rao Sindhia, which went far to secure general tranquillity; but he died in 1797, and confusion at once followed. Tukoji Rao left two legitimate sons, K\u0101shi Rao and Malh\u0101r Rao; and two illegitimate sons, Jaswant Rao and Vithoj\u012b. K\u0101shi Rao was of weak intellect, and Malh\u0101r Rao had attempted to be recognized by Tukoji as successor. Failing to attain his desire, Malh\u0101r Rao threw himself on the protection of N\u0101na Farnav\u012bs. K\u0101shi Rao then appealed to Daulat Rao Sindhia, who at once seized this opportunity of becoming practically the manager of the Holkar estates, and Malh\u0101r Rao was attacked and killed. From this disaster, Jaswant Rao and Vithoj\u012b escaped. The former, after a fugitive life spent partly as a prisoner at N\u0101gpur and partly at Dh\u0101r, managed at length to raise a force\nand appeared as the champion of Khande Rao, a posthumous son of Malh\u0101r Rao, being joined in 1798 by Amir Kh\u0101n (afterwards Naw\u0101b of Tonk). K\u0101sh\u012b Rao\u2019s troops under Dudreneec were defeated at Kasr\u0101wad, whereupon Dudreneec transferred his allegiance and his battalions to Jaswant Rao, who entered the capital town of Maheshwar and seized the treasury there. Soon afterwards, however, he was defeated at Satw\u0101s by some of Sindhia\u2019s battalions and retired on Indore, but subsequently attacked Ujjain, extracting a large sum from its inhabitants. In October, 1801, Sarje Rao Gh\u0101tke, the notorious minister of Daulat Rao Sindhia, sacked Indore, practising every kind of atrocity on the inhabitants and razing the town to the ground. Jaswant Rao, however, assisted by Amir Kh\u0101n and his Pind\u0101ris, then proceeded to scour the country from the Jumna to the Niz\u0101m\u2019s territories. By 1802 he had regained his prestige, and so increased his forces as to be able to attack the Peshw\u0101 at Poona. This defeat drove the Peshw\u0101 to sign the Treaty of Bassein with the British, and Jaswant Rao was forced to retire to M\u0101lw\u0101. He held aloof during the war of 1803 against Sindhia, possibly in hopes of aggrandizing himself at that chief\u2019s expense. But in 1804, after rejecting all offers of negotiation, he finally came into collision with the British forces. In the Mukandw\u0101ra pass he gained a temporary success over Colonel Monson, but was defeated by Lord Lake at Dig (November, 1804). In December, 1805, he was driven to sign the Treaty of R\u0101jpurgh\u0101t on the banks of the Be\u0101s river, the first engagement entered into between the British Government and the house of Holkar. By this treaty he ceded much land in R\u0101jput\u0101na, but received back certain of his former possessions in the Deccan, while the country round K\u016bnch in Bundelkhand was granted in j\u0101gir to his daughter, Bhima Bai, who was married to Govind Rao Bolia. Lord Cornwallis\u2019s policy of non-interference, however, gave him another chance; the R\u0101jput\u0101na districts were restored to him, and he proceeded to recoup his shattered fortunes by plundering the R\u0101jput chiefs. In 1806 he poisoned Khande Rao and murdered K\u0101sh\u012b Rao, and thus became in name, what he had long been in fact, the head of the house of Holkar. He began at this time to show signs of insanity, and died a raving lunatic at Bh\u0101npura in 1811.\n\nJaswant Rao left no legitimate heirs; but before his death, Tuls\u012b Bai, his concubine, a woman of remarkable beauty and superior education, had adopted his illegitimate son, Malh\u0101r Rao, who was placed on the gaddi, Z\u0101l\u012bm Singh of Kotah coming to Bh\u0101npura to pay the homage due from a feudatory to his suzerain. After Jaswant Rao\u2019s death the State rapidly became involved in difficulties. Revenue was collected at the sword\u2019s point indiscriminately from Sindhia\u2019s, the Ponw\u0101r\u2019s, or even Holkar\u2019s own territories. There was in fact no real administration, its place being taken by a merc wandering and\npredatory court, presided over by a woman whose profligate ways disgusted even her not too particular associates. Plot and anarchy were rife. Tulsi Bai was personally desirous of making terms with the British, but was seized and murdered by her troops, and things rapidly grew from bad to worse.\n\nOn the outbreak of the war in 1817 between the British and the Peshw\u0101 the Indore Darb\u0101r assumed a hostile attitude. The defeat, however, of the State forces by Sir Thomas Hislop's division at Meh\u012bdpur compelled Holkar to come to terms; and on January 6, 1818, he signed the Treaty of Mandasor, which still governs the relations existing between the State and the British Government. By this agreement Amir Kh\u0101n was recognized as an independent chief, all claims on the R\u0101jput\u0101na chiefs were abandoned, and all land held by Holkar south of the Narbad\u0101 was given up, while the British Government undertook to keep up a field force sufficient to protect the territory from aggression and maintain its tranquillity (this force still being represented by the Mhow garrison), the State army was reduced to reasonable proportions, and a contingent force raised at the expense of the State to co-operate with the British when required. Ghaf\u016br Kh\u0101n was recognized as Naw\u0101b of Jaora, independent of the Indore Darb\u0101r, and a Resident was appointed at Holkar's court.\n\nThe immense benefit conferred by this treaty soon became apparent. The State income in 1817 was scarcely 5 lakhs, and even that sum was only extorted by violence, representing rather the gains of a predatory horde than the revenue of an established State. The administration was taken over by T\u0101nti\u0101 Jogh, who by the time of his death in 1826 had raised the revenue to 27 lakhs, which, added to certain payments made by the British Government and tributary States, brought the total to 30 lakhs. After T\u0101nti\u0101 Jogh's death, however, things again fell into confusion. Malh\u0101r Rao was extravagant and weak, and easily led by favourites. Two insurrections broke out, one, of some importance, being led by Har\u012b Rao Holkar, who, however, surrendered and was imprisoned at Maheshwar (1819).\n\nMalh\u0101r Rao died in 1833 at twenty-eight years of age, and was succeeded by M\u0101rtand Rao, a boy adopted by the late chief's widow, Gautama Bai. Har\u012b Rao, however, was released from the fort of Maheshwar by his supporters; and as the adoption of M\u0101rtand Rao had been made without the knowledge of the British Government, Har\u012b Rao was formally installed by the Resident in April, 1834, M\u0101rtand Rao receiving a pension. R\u0101j\u0101 Bhao Phansia, a confirmed drunkard, had been selected as minister and the administration soon fell into confusion, which was added to by the excessive weakness of the chief. Life and property were unsafe, while numerous intrigues were set on foot on behalf of M\u0101rtand Rao. Har\u012b Rao died in 1843,\nand was succeeded by Khande Rao, who was half imbecile and died within four months.\n\nThe claims of Martand Rao were now again urged, but the British Government declined to sanction his succession. It was then suggested by the M\u0101 S\u0101hiba Kesara Bai, a widow of Jaswant Rao, that the younger son of Bhao Holkar, uncle to Martand Rao, should be chosen, and the youth was installed in 1844 as Tukoji Rao Holkar II. The Regency Council which had held office under the late chief continued, but a close supervision was now maintained by the Resident, and numerous reforms were set on foot. In 1848 the young chief began to take a part in the administration. Kesara Bai, who had been respected by all classes and rendered great assistance to the British authorities, died in 1849. The chief then took a larger share in the government, and showed his aptitude for ruling so rapidly that full powers were granted to him in 1852. In the Mutiny of 1857, Holkar was unable to restrain his troops, who consisted of about 2,000 regular and 4,000 irregular infantry, 2,000 regular and 1,200 irregular cavalry, with 24 guns. The irregular force attacked the Residency, and the Agent to the Governor-General was obliged to retire to Sehore. Holkar personally gave every possible assistance to the authorities at Mhow; he established regular postal communication, and at considerable risk protected many Christians in his palace.\n\nIn order to make the Indore State more compact, various exchanges of territory were effected between 1861 and 1868, the districts of Satw\u0101s in Nem\u0101war, of Barw\u0101ha, Dhargaon, Kasr\u0101wad, and Mandleshwar in Nim\u0101r being exchanged for land held in the Deccan, the United Provinces, and elsewhere. In 1877, 360 square miles of territory in the S\u0101tpur\u0101 region were transferred to Holkar as an act of grace and to commemorate the assumption by Her Majesty of the title of Empress of India. A postal convention was effected in 1878 and a salt convention in 1880.\n\nIn 1860 a sum of more than 3 lakhs was paid to Holkar as compensation for expenses incurred in raising a body of troops in place of the Mehidpur Contingent, which had mutinied; and in 1865 the contribution to the upkeep of the Mehidpur Contingent and M\u0101lw\u0101 Bhil Corps was capitalized. Holkar receives Rs. 25,424 a year in compensation for the P\u0101tan district made over to Bundi in 1818, and Rs. 57,874 tribute from the Part\u0101bgarh State in R\u0101jput\u0101na, both payments being made through the British Government. In 1864 he ceded all land required for railways throughout the State, and in 1869 contributed a crore of rupees towards the construction of the Khandw\u0101-Indore branch of the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway, known as the Holkar State Railway. Tukoji Rao was made a G.C.S.I. in 1861; and at the Delhi assemblage on January 1, 1877, he was made\na Counsellor of the Empress and a C.I.E. He died in 1886 and was succeeded by his eldest son Sivaji Rao, born in 1859.\n\nOn his accession, the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 abolished all transit dues in the State. He visited England in 1887 on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Queen-Empress Victoria, when he was made a G.C.S.I. His administration, however, was not a success, and for the better supervision of so large a State a separate Resident at Indore was appointed in 1899. In 1902 the State coinage was replaced by British currency. In 1903 Sivaji Rao abdicated in favour of his son Tukoj\u012b Rao III, the present chief, who is a minor, and is studying at the Mayo College at Ajmer. The ex-Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 lives in the palace at Barw\u0101ha, receiving an allowance of 4 lakhs a year. The chief bears the titles of His Highness and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja-dhiraj R\u0101j Rajeshwar Sawai Bah\u0101dur, and receives a salute of 19 guns, or 21 guns within the limits of Indore territory.\n\nBesides Dhamn\u0101r and Un, there are no places of known archaeological importance in the State. Remains are, however, numerous throughout the M\u0101lw\u0101 district, being principally Jain and Hindu temples of the tenth to the thirteenth century; in some cases the temples have been built from the ruins of older buildings, as for example at Mori, Indok, Jh\u0101rda, Makla, and many other places. In the Nim\u0101r and Nem\u0101war districts a considerable number of Muhammadan remains are to be met with, while forts are found throughout the State, those at Hingl\u0101jgarh, Bij\u0101garh, and Sendhwa being the most important.\n\nThere have been three complete enumerations of the State, giving (1881) 1,054,237, (1891) 1,099,990, and (1901) 850,690. The density in 1901 was 90 persons per square mile, rising in the plateau area to 112 persons, and dropping in the hilly tract to 69. The population increased by 4 per cent. between 1881 and 1891, but fell by 23 per cent. in the next decade. The decrease is mainly due to the effect of bad seasons, notably the disastrous famine of 1899-1900, from which the State had not had time to recover when the latest enumeration was made.\n\nThe main statistics of population and land revenue are given on the next page.\n\nThe chief towns are Indore City, R\u0101mpura, Khargon, Maheshwar, Mehidpur, Barw\u0101ha, and Bh\u0101npura (excluding the British cantonment of Mhow and the civil station of Indore). There are also 3,368 villages, with an average number of 252 inhabitants. Classified by religion, Hindus number 673,107, or 79 per cent.; Animists, 94,047, or 11 per cent.; Musalm\u0101ns, 68,862, or 8 per cent.; and Jains, 14,255, or 2 per cent. The principal languages are M\u0101lw\u012b and the allied Nim\u0101ri and R\u0101ngri, spoken by 240,000 persons, or 28 per cent.; and Hindi, spoken by 492,895, or 57 per cent.\nThe prevailing castes are Br\u0101hmans, 71,000, or 8 per cent.; Balais, 61,000, or 7 per cent.; R\u0101jputs, 57,000, or 7 per cent.; Cham\u0101rs, 33,000, or 4 per cent.; and G\u016bjars, 28,000, or 3 per cent. About 40 per cent. of the population are supported by agriculture, 23 per cent. by general labour, 10 per cent. by State service, and 5 per cent. by mendicancy. Br\u0101hmans and R\u0101jputs are the principal landholders, the cultivators being chiefly R\u0101jputs, G\u016bjars, Sondhias, Kh\u0101tis, and Kunb\u012bs, and in the southern districts Bhil\u0101las.\n\n| District          | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population, 1901 | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1871 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write | Land revenue and cesses of the k\u0101l\u0101s, 1902-3 |\n|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|---------|------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Alampur /argama   | 37                   | 26             | 16,711  | 452              | - 1.9                     | 347                                                      | 58,900                                 | Rs.                                         |\n| R\u0101mpura-Bh\u0101npura  | 2,123                | 4              | 869     | 156,021          | 7.3                       | - 45.8                                                   | 7,142                                  | 6,92,600                                    |\n| Mehidpur          | 840                  | 4              | 432     | 91,857           | 109                      | - 23.8                                                   | 2,355                                  | 4,177,100                                   |\n| Nem\u0101war           | 1,959                | 337            | 74,568  | 70               | - 23.4                    | 2,654                                                    | 3,64,800                               |                                             |\n| Indore            | 1,570                | 2              | 639     | 254,423          | 162                      | - 5.6                                                    | 18,729                                 | 12,64,700                                   |\n| Nimar             | 3,871                | 3              | 1,695   | 257,110          | 66                       | - 12.4                                                   | 8,324                                  | 9,55,600                                    |\n| Total             | 9,500                | 11             | 3,368   | 850,690          | 90                       | - 22.7                                                   | 39,251                                 | 37,93,700                                   |\n\nThe Canadian Presbyterian Mission have their head-quarters in the Residency, and also carry on work in Indore city. In 1901 native Christians numbered 91.\n\nThe general agricultural conditions vary with the two natural divisions of the State. The plateau section shares in the conditions common to the fertile M\u0100LW\u0100 plateau, the soil in this region being mainly of the well-known black cotton variety, producing excellent crops of every kind, while the population is composed of industrious cultivators. In the Nim\u0101r and Nem\u0101war districts the soil is less fertile, except actually in the Narbad\u0101 valley, and the rainfall rather lower, while the Bhils, who form the majority of the population, are very indifferent cultivators. In both cases, the success or failure of the crops depends entirely on the rainfall. The classification of soils adopted by the cultivators themselves is based on the appearance and quality of the soil, its proximity to a village, and its capability for bearing special kinds of crops. The main classes recognized are: m\u0101r or k\u0101li matti, the black cotton soil, of which there are several varieties; p\u012bl\u012b, a light yellow soil; p\u0101ndhar, a white soil, of loose texture; antharp\u0101tha, a black loamy soil with rock close below it; and khurai, a red-coloured stony soil. According to their position and crop-bearing qualities, soils are termed chauras, \u2018even\u2019; dh\u0101lu, \u2018sloping\u2019; chhapera, \u2018broken\u2019 soil; or r\u0101khad, land close to villages. Land bearing rice is called s\u0101lgatta. Only the\nblack soil yields a spring as well as an autumn crop. Manuring is not much resorted to, except in the case of special crops or on land close to villages, where manure is easily procurable. All irrigated land produces as a rule two crops.\n\nOf the total area of the State, 1,280 square miles, or 12 per cent., have been alienated in grants, leaving 8,220 square miles directly under the State. Of this, 1,738 square miles, or 21 per cent., were cultivated in 1902-3; 3,000 square miles, or 36 per cent., were forest; 1,841 square miles, or 22 per cent., cultivable but not cultivated; and the rest waste.\n\nThe principal statistics of cultivation in 1902-3 are shown in the following table, in square miles:\n\n| District          | Total | Cultivated (kh\u0101lsa) | Irrigated | Cultivable waste (kh\u0101lsa) |\n|-------------------|-------|---------------------|-----------|--------------------------|\n| Alampur (pargana)| 37    | 29                  | 0.3       | 3                        |\n| R\u0101mpura-Bh\u0101npura  | 2,123 | 330                 | 36        | 146                      |\n| Meh\u012bdpur          | 840   | 261                 | 2         | 453                      |\n| Nem\u0101war           | 1,059 | 200                 | 8         | 256                      |\n| Indore            | 1,570 | 578                 | 19.7      | 428                      |\n| Nim\u0101r             | 3,871 | 340                 | 17        | 555                      |\n| **Total**         | **9,500** | **1,738**     | **83**    | **1,841**                |\n\nThe chief autumn crops are, in square miles: cotton (220), jow\u0101r (178), b\u0101jra (93), maize (82), and t\u016bar (38); the chief spring crops are gram (1,021), als\u012b (143), poppy (35), and wheat (34). The staple food-grains are maize, jow\u0101r, b\u0101jra, wheat, barley, gram, and t\u016bar.\n\nAll attempts to introduce new varieties of seed have been hitherto unsuccessful. The State makes liberal allowances in both seed and cash to cultivators in villages managed directly by Darb\u0101r officers. The advances are repayable at harvest, interest at the rate of 12\u00bd per cent. being charged. No interest is charged on cash advances for the purchase of bullocks. In the case of villages farmed out the farmer makes the advances, receiving one and a quarter or one and a half times the amount advanced.\n\nThere are two local breeds of cattle, the M\u0101lwi and Nim\u0101ri. Those of the M\u0101lwi breed are medium-sized, generally of a grey, silver-grey, or white colour, and are strong and active. The Nim\u0101ri breed is much larger than the M\u0101lwi, and well adapted to heavy work. These cattle are usually of a broken red and white colour, more rarely all red with white spots. They are bought for military purposes.\n\nOnly 5 per cent. of the total cultivated area is irrigated, and irrigation is mainly confined to certain crops, such as poppy and sugar-cane, which can only be grown by means of artificial watering. The yellow\nsoil, which is met with in some quantity in the R\u0101mpura-Bh\u0101npura and Nim\u0101r districts and in the Petl\u0101wad pargana, requires watering for the production of good crops of all kinds, and irrigation is, therefore, much more common in these districts than elsewhere. Irrigation is usually done from wells by means of a lift. The construction of irrigation works was greatly encouraged by Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Tukoj\u012b Rao Holkar II. The wells belong as a rule to private individuals, and tanks and dams to the State; the latter were formerly under district officers, and have, through neglect, fallen into bad repair. A regular irrigation branch has now been started, and large sums have been sanctioned for the restoration of old irrigation works and the construction of new ones. The revenue paid by the cultivators depends on the crop-bearing power of the soil, the possibility of irrigation, and its proximity to a village, which facilitates manuring.\n\nForests cover approximately 3,000 square miles. Prior to 1903 they were roughly divided into \u2018major\u2019 and \u2018minor\u2019 jungles, controlled respectively by the State Forest department and the district officials. Contractors were permitted to collect forest produce, paying the requisite dues on leaving the forest. An experienced Forest officer has now been put in charge with a view to systematic management. Every facility is given in famine years for the grazing of cattle and collection of jungle produce. In 1902-3 the forest receipts were 1.8 lakhs, and the expenditure was Rs. 59,000. The forests lie in three belts. In the hilly region north of R\u0101mpura-Bh\u0101npura s\u0101dad or s\u0101j (Terminalia tomentosa), dhaora (Anogeissus latifolia), tendya (Lagerstroemia parviflora), khair (Acacia Catechu), and tend\u016b (Diospyros tomentosa) prevail; on the main line of the Vindhya north of the Narbad\u0101, and also in the country south of that river, including the heavy forest area of the S\u0101tpur\u0101s, teak, anjan (Hardwickia binata), and salai (Boswellia serrata) occur.\n\nNo mineral deposits of any commercial value are known in the State, although hematite exists in large quantities at Barw\u0101ha and was formerly worked. Building stone of good quality is obtained in a few places, the quarries at Gh\u0101tia and K\u0101tk\u016bt being the most important.\n\nThe manufactures of the State are of little importance, but the cotton fabrics produced at Mah\u0113shwar are well-known. A cotton mill has been in existence in Indore city since 1870, producing coarse cloth, chiefly for local use. The mill was originally worked by the State, but since 1903 has been leased to a contractor, who also rents the ginning factory and press attached. About 500 hands are employed, wages ranging from 2 to 6 annas a day. A State workshop under the Public Works department was opened in 1905, which undertakes casting and forging, carriage-building, and other work.\nA considerable trade is carried on in grain, hemp fibres, cotton, and opium, which are exported to Bombay. The principal imports are European hardware, machinery, piece-goods, kerosene oil, European stores, and wines. The chief trade centres are Indore, Mhow, Barw\u0101ha, San\u0101wad, and Tar\u0101na.\n\nThe Indore State is traversed by the Khandw\u0101-Ajmer branch of the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway. The section from Indore to Khandw\u0101 through Mhow cantonment is known as the Holkar State Railway, the Darb\u0101r having granted a loan of one crore for its construction. The line crosses the Narbad\u0101 at the foot of the Vindhyan scarp by a bridge of fourteen spans of 200 feet each. The Ratl\u0101m-Godhra branch of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway passes through the Petl\u0101wad pargana, and the Bhop\u0101l-Ujjain Railway through the Mehidpur district, with a station at Tar\u0101na Road. The N\u0101gda-B\u0101ran-Mutra line, now under construction, will pass through the Mehidpur and R\u0101mpura-Bh\u0101npura districts.\n\nThe chief metalled roads are the Agra-Bombay road, of which 80 miles lie in the State; the Indore-Simrol-Khandw\u0101 road, with 50 miles; and the Mhow-Nimach road, 12 miles in length, all of which are maintained by the British Government. Many new roads are now under construction, by which the territory will be considerably opened out.\n\nA State postal system was first started in 1873 by Sir T. M\u0101dhava Rao, when minister to Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Tukoj\u012b Rao II, and three issues of stamps have been made. In 1878 a convention was made with the British Post Office, by which a mutual exchange of correspondence was arranged. There are also twelve British post offices in the State, through which 157,156 articles paid and unpaid were sent in 1903-4, the total cash receipts being Rs. 72,000.\n\nThe most serious general famine since the formation of the State was that of 1899-1900, which visited M\u0101lw\u0101 with special severity. The distress was enhanced by a succession of bad years, in which the rainfall had been (1895) 29 inches, (1896) 26 inches, (1897) 30 inches, (1898) 39 inches, and (1899) 10 inches; and by the inability of the people to cope with a calamity of which they had had no previous experience. Only 37 per cent. of the land revenue demand was realized in 1899-1900, while prices rose for a time to 100 and even 300 per cent. above the average during the previous five years. Strenuous efforts were made to relieve distress, 15 lakhs being expended from State funds and 3 lakhs from charitable grants, in addition to various works opened as relief works. The disastrous effects were only too apparent in the Census of 1901, while the large number of deserted houses, still to be seen in every village, show even more forcibly the severity of the calamity. The number of\npersons who came on relief for one day was 572,317, or more than half the total population.\n\nThe State is divided for administrative purposes into five zilas or districts\u2014Indore, Mehidpur, Rampura-Bhanpura, Nemawar, and Nimar\u2014besides the isolated pargana of Alampur, which is separately managed. Each zila is in charge of a Subah, who is the revenue officer for his charge and a magistrate of the first class. Subdivisions of the zilas, called parganas, are in charge of amans, who are subordinate magistrates and revenue officers and act under the orders of the Subah.\n\nThe chief being a minor, the ultimate administrative control is at present vested in the Resident, who is assisted by a minister and a Council of Regency of ten members, who hold office for three years. The minister is the chief executive officer. A special judicial committee of three members deals with appeals and judicial matters, while separate members individually control the judicial, revenue, settlement, finance, and other administrative departments.\n\nThe judicial system consists of the Sadr or High Court, presided over by the chief justice with a joint judge, and district and sessions courts subordinate to it. The Sadr Court has power to pass any legal sentence, but the confirmation of the Resident and Council is required for sentences involving death or imprisonment for more than fourteen years. Its original jurisdiction is unlimited; appeals from it lie to the judicial committee and Council, while all appeals from subordinate courts lie to it. When not a minor, the chief has full powers of life and death over his subjects. Sessions courts can impose sentences of imprisonment up to seven years. The district courts can try cases up to Rs. 1,000 in value. The British codes, and many other Acts modified to suit local requirements, are used in the State. In 1904 the courts disposed of 7,700 original criminal cases and 331 appeals, and 10,763 civil cases and 565 appeals, the value of property in dispute being 1.3 lakhs. The judicial establishment costs about 1.3 lakhs per annum.\n\nThe State has a normal revenue of 54 lakhs, of which 38 lakhs are derived from land, 2.7 lakhs from customs, 3.2 lakhs from excise, 1.8 lakhs from forests, and 10 lakhs from interest on Government securities. The chief heads of expenditure are: general administration (14.6 lakhs), chief's establishment (11.8 lakhs), army (9.7 lakhs), public works (5.8 lakhs), police (3.6 lakhs), law and justice (1.6 lakhs), education (Rs. 82,000), sayar or customs (Rs. 71,000), medical and forests (Rs. 59,900 each).\n\nThe State is the sole proprietor of the soil, the cultivators having only the right to occupy as long as they continue to pay the revenue assessed. In a few special cases mortgage and alienation are permissible. Villages may be classed in two groups: khalsa, or those managed\ndirectly by the State; and *ij\u0101ra*, or farmed villages. Leases of the latter are usually given for five years, the farmer being responsible for the whole of the revenue, less $12\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. commission, of which $2\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. is allowed for working expenses and 10 per cent. as actual profit.\n\nUntil 1865 whole *parganas* were granted to farmers, a general rate being assessed of Rs. 8 per acre for irrigated and R. 1 for unirrigated land. In that year a rough survey was completed, on which a fifteen years' settlement was made, the demand being 38 lakhs. A fresh assessment was made in 1881; but excessive rates and mismanagement rendered it abortive, only about 45 lakhs being realized annually out of a demand of 65 lakhs. The cultivators despaired of paying off their debts and commenced to leave their homes, while the village bankers refused to advance money. For the best black cotton soil, capable of bearing two crops a year, the rates at present range from Rs. 6 to Rs. 56 per acre. Ordinary irrigated land pays from Rs. 3 to Rs. 8 an acre, the average being about Rs. 4, and unirrigated land from a few annas to R. 1. In 1900 a detailed survey was commenced, and a regular settlement was begun in 1904. In that year 38 lakhs were collected out of a demand of 45 lakhs. A considerable proportion is derived from the high rates paid for land bearing poppy.\n\nOpium is subject to numerous duties. The crude article, called *ch\u012bk*, brought into Indore city for manufacture into opium, pays a tax of Rs. 16 per *maund*. The manufactured article, again, is liable to a complicated series of no less than twenty-four impositions, of which fourteen are connected with *satta* transactions or bargain-gambling carried on during its sale. The total amount of the impositions, including an export tax of Rs. 13\u20138\u20130 on each chest (140 lb.) exported to Bombay, amounts to Rs. 50 per chest. About Rs. 30,000 a year is derived from the registration and control of the *satta* transactions. In 1902\u20133, 4,767 chests of opium were exported, and the total income from duties was about 1.8 lakhs.\n\nSalt which has paid the tax in British India is imported for local consumption duty free, under the engagement of 1883, by which the Indore State receives from the British Government Rs. 61,875 per annum in lieu of duties formerly levied.\n\nThe excise administration is as yet very imperfect. The out-still and farming systems of British India are followed in different tracts. Liquor is chiefly made from the flowers of the *mahu\u0101* (*Bassia latifolia*), which grows plentifully in the State. In 1902\u20133 the total receipts on account of country liquor were 1.4 lakhs, giving an incidence of 1 anna 10 pies per head of population.\n\nThe State coinage until 1903 consisted of various local issues,\nincluding the H\u0101li rupee coined in Indore city. The British rupee became legal tender in June, 1902.\n\nMunicipalities are being gradually constituted throughout the State. Besides Indore city, there are now municipalities at fourteen places, the chief of which are Barw\u0101ha, Mehidpur, and Tar\u0101na.\n\nA State Engineer was appointed in the time of Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Tukoji Rao II, but no regular Public Works department was organized until 1903. It now includes seven divisions, five for district work and two for the city, each division being in charge of a divisional engineer. The department is carrying out a great number of works, including 250 miles of metalled and 40 of unmetalled roads, besides numerous buildings.\n\nThe foundation of the Holkar State army was laid in 1792, when Ahaly\u0101 Bai, following the example of Mah\u0101dji Sindhia, engaged the services of Chevalier Dudrenee, a French adventurer, known to natives as Huz\u016br Beg, to raise four regular battalions. Though these battalions were defeated at Lakheri in 1793 by De Boigne, their excellent fighting qualities led to the raising of six fresh battalions, which two years after took part in the battle of Kardla (1795). In 1817 Malh\u0101r Rao\u2019s army consisted of 10,000 infantry, 15,000 horse, and 100 field guns, besides Pind\u0101ris and other irregulars; but the forces were largely reduced under the Treaty of Mandasor (1818). In 1887 Holkar raised a regiment of Imperial Service cavalry, which in 1902 was converted into a transport corps with a cavalry escort. The State army at present consists of 210 artillerymen with 18 serviceable guns, 800 cavalry, and 748 infantry. The transport corps is composed of 200 carts, with 300 ponies and an escort of 200 cavalry.\n\nThe policing of the State was formerly carried out by a special force detached from the State army, which consisted of three regiments of irregular infantry, a body of 1,100 irregular horse, a mule battery, and a bullock battery. In 1902 a regular police force was organized, which now consists of an Inspector-General with the administrative staff and 10 inspectors, 50 sub-inspectors, 2,135 constables and head constables, and 140 mounted police with 1 ris\u0101ld\u0101r. The State is divided into seven police districts\u2014Alampur, R\u0101mpura, Bh\u0101npura, Mehidpur, Khar-gon, Indore, and Mandleshwar\u2014each under a district inspector. The number of rural police or chaukid\u0101rs is based on the village area, at the ratio of one chaukid\u0101r to each village of 40 to 130 ploughs, two to one of 130 to 190, and six to one of over 260 ploughs.\n\nThere were no regular jails in the State before 1875, when Sir T. M\u0101dhava Rao built the Central jail in Indore city. In 1878 the manufacture of coarse cotton cloth and other articles was introduced. There are four district jails, one in each zill\u0101 except Nem\u0101war, the prisoners for this district being sent to the Nim\u0101r jail.\nIn 1901, 5 per cent. of the people (9.4 males and 6.4 females) were able to read and write. The first definite attempt at encouraging education was made in 1843, during the time of Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Har\u012b Rao Holkar, who at the solicitation of the Resident, Sir Claude Wade, assigned a large State dharm\u0101la for a school, at the same time levying a small cess on opium chests passing through the city, the proceeds of which were devoted to its upkeep. Four branches were started, for teaching English, Mar\u0101th\u012b, Hindi, and Persian, and the institution continued to increase in importance. In 1891 the Holkar College was established, under a European principal. Two boarding-houses were also constructed, which are capable of accommodating 40 students. The College contains on an average 70 students, and is affiliated to the Allah\u0101b\u0101d University. Scholarships are granted by the State to selected students desirous of pursuing their studies at the Bombay Medical College or elsewhere. Vernacular education in villages was first undertaken in 1865, and 79 schools had been opened by 1868, including 3 for girls. In 1902-3 there were 88 schools for boys with 5,987 pupils, and 3 for girls with 182 pupils.\n\nTill 1850 no steps had been taken by the State to provide medical relief for its subjects. In 1852 Tukoj\u012b Rao II. on receiving full powers, made a yearly grant of Rs. 500 to the Indore Charitable Hospital, the Resident at the same time undertaking to maintain a dispensary in Indore city. Soon after, 4 district dispensaries were opened. By 1891, one hospital and 14 dispensaries had been established, and 34 native Vaidyas and Hak\u012bms were employed. There are now 23 district hospitals and dispensaries, and 39 native Vaidyas and Hak\u012bms, besides the Central Tukoj\u012b Rao Hospital and dispensaries in the city. The total number of cases treated in 1902-3 was 186,479, of which 37,819 were treated in the Tukoji Rao Hospital. A lunatic asylum is supervised by the jail Superintendent.\n\nVaccination is carried on regularly, and 7,869 persons, or 9 per 1,000 of the population, were protected in 1902-3.\n\n**Indore Zila.**\u2014District of the Indore State, Central India, lying between 22\u00b0 22' and 23\u00b0 9' N. and 74\u00b0 36' and 76\u00b0 15' E., with an area of 1,570 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Gwalior; on the west by Gwalior, Dh\u0101r, and the British pargana of M\u0101npur; on the south by the Nim\u0101r district of Indore; and on the east by Dew\u0101s. The district lies mainly on the M\u0101lw\u0101 plateau, and shares in the general conditions common to that tract. In the south, where it meets the Vindhyan range, it is somewhat cut up by hills. The population decreased from 279,915 in 1891 to 254,423 in 1901, giving a density in the latter year of 162 persons per square mile. The district contains 639 villages and two towns, Indore City (population, 86,686) and Gautampur\u0101 (3,103), besides enclosing the Camp of the Agent to the\nGovernor-General (see Indore City) and Mhow. It is in charge of a Subah, whose head-quarters are at Indore city; and for administrative purposes it is divided into seven parganas, each in charge of an amin, who is collector and magistrate, with head-quarters at Indore, Betma, Depalpur, Petl\u0101wad, Khurel, Mhow, and S\u0101nwer. The land revenue is about 12-6 lakhs.\n\nA considerable trade in grain and opium is carried on, these commodities being exported mainly from Indore and Mhow. The district is traversed by the Ajmer-Khandwa section of the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway, and by metalled roads from Agra to Bombay, Indore to Simrol and Khandwa, Mhow to Nimach, Indore to Betma, and Indore to Depalpur, while many new feeder-roads are under construction.\n\n**Indore City (Ind\u016br).**\u2014Capital of the State of the same name in Central India, situated in $22^\\circ 43' N.$ and $75^\\circ 54' E.$, on the banks of two small streams, the Saraswat\u012b and Kh\u0101n, tributary to the Sipr\u0101, and on the Ajmer-Khandwa section of the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway, 440 miles from Bombay. The city stands 1,738 feet above sea-level, and covers an area of about 5 square miles. A village appears to have been founded here in 1715, when certain zam\u012bnd\u0101rs from the village of Kampel, 16 miles east of Indore, came and settled on the banks of the Kh\u0101n river, attracted by the trade with the camps of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 chiefs passing on their way to and from the Deccan, this spot being one of the regular stages on the route north of the Narbad\u0101. In 1741 they erected the temple of Indreshwar, of which the present name is a very common corruption.\n\nAhaly\u0101 Bai is said to have been attracted by the place, and, though Maheshwar remained the chief town in Holkar's territory, she moved the district head-quarters here from Kampel. In 1801, however, the growing prosperity of Indore received a severe check, during the hostilities between Daulat Rao Sindhia and Jaswant Rao Holkar. An engagement took place in which Jaswant Rao was defeated and forced to retire to J\u0101m in the Vindhya. The town was delivered up to the mercies of the notorious Sarje Rao Ghatke, who plundered the bazar, razed all houses of any importance to the ground, and inflicted every form of atrocity on the inhabitants, so that the wells in the neighbourhood were filled with the corpses of unfortunate women who had committed suicide to escape dishonour. Jaswant Rao always made R\u0101mpura and Bh\u0101npura his administrative head-quarters, and it was not till after the Treaty of Mandasor (1818) that Indore became the capital of the State in fact as well as in name. In 1857 Indore and the Residency were the scene of considerable disturbances. Holkar's Muhammadan troops mutinied and, after attacking the Resident's house on July 1, marched northwards to join the rebels at Gwalior. The Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, however, gave all the assistance he could, and, in spite\nof the demands of his troops, refused to surrender a number of Christians to whom he had given sanctuary in his palace.\n\nPopulation is rising steadily: (1881) 75,401, (1891) 82,984, and (1901) 86,686. These figures do not include the residents in the adjoining tract called the Agent to the Governor-General's Camp, which is described below. In 1901 Hindus numbered 65,103, or 75 per cent.; Musalm\u0101ns, 18,652, or 21 per cent.; Jains, 2,558; and P\u0101rs\u012bs, 7.\n\nIndore, always an important commercial town, is now one of the largest trade centres in Central India, and the chief collecting and distributing centre for Southern M\u0101lw\u0101. The chief articles of export are grain, tobacco, opium, country paper, cloths, and metal vessels; the chief imports are European hardware, cloth, stores, machinery, building materials, kerosene oil, and raw cotton. There are no arts or manufactures of any importance, except the weaving of coarse cloth carried on in the city cotton mill.\n\nThe city is divided into two main divisions: Old Indore, and the modern city with its continually spreading suburbs. The main thoroughfare leads across the Kh\u0101n river into the great square in front of the palaces, and the remaining streets are poor and narrow. No buildings have special claims to architectural importance in the city, the most striking being the old palace, a lofty and imposing structure towering above all other buildings; but many houses are adorned with fine wood-carving. Outside the city proper, on the western side of the railway, lie the cotton-mill, the new town hall, called the King Edward Hall, and the State officers' club; while to the east a new quarter known as Tukoganj is being opened out, containing the official residences of State officers and other houses. The remaining buildings of importance are the new palace constructed by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Sivaji Rao Holkar, the Tukoji Rao Hospital, State offices, guesthouse, English school, jail, barracks for the Imperial Service and State troops, and cenotaphs of deceased chiefs. The Holkar College stands upon the Agra-Bombay road, about 2 miles from the city.\n\nMunicipal self-government was instituted in 1870, and the committee consists of seventeen members, four of whom are State officials. The conservancy, lighting, roads, and general administration of the city are in its hands. Funds are obtained from octroi and other taxes, the annual income amounting to about Rs. 70,000.\n\nAfter the Treaty of Mandasor in 1818, a piece of land with an area of 1.35 square miles was assigned by the Indore Darb\u0101r for the use of the Resident at the court of Holkar. In 1854, on the appointment of an Agent to the Governor-General for Central India, this became his head-quarters, and is still commonly known to Europeans as the Residency or Camp. In 1857, during the Mutiny, the officiating Agent to the Governor-General, Colonel Durand, was obliged to retire\nto Sehore. The Residency house, which was built between 1820 and 1827, is a substantial structure of basalt, standing in fine open park-like surroundings near the Kh\u0101n, a tributary of the Sipr\u0101, which has been dammed so as to form a lake. Besides the Residency, the Camp contains official houses for the Resident at Indore (see INDORE RESIDENCY), two Assistants to the Agent to the Governor-General, the Residency Surgeon, and other officers. Other buildings of importance are the head-quarters offices, the Daly College for sons of Central India chiefs, a church and a Roman Catholic chapel, a large civil hospital, and a Central jail. The station is garrisoned by one company of British infantry and the M\u0101lw\u0101 Bhil Corps, besides the Agent's escort of a detachment of Central India Horse. The population in 1901 was 11,118. The head-quarters of the Canadian Presbyterian Mission, including a large college, are situated in the station. The Residency bazar, originally a small settlement, has expanded into a large trade centre, and is under the immediate administrative control of an Assistant to the Agent to the Governor-General. A considerable income is derived from cesses and taxes, yielding Rs. 50,000 per annum, which is expended on sanitation, education, medical relief, and the policing of the station. The head-quarters of the M\u0101lw\u0101 Opium Agency are also situated here, including a set of Government scales at which duty is paid on opium for export. Administrative and jurisdictional powers within Residency limits are vested in the Agent to the Governor-General (see CENTRAL INDIA).\n\nInd\u016br District\u00b9.\u2014District in the Bidar Division of Hyderabad State, lying between the Districts of Sirpur T\u0101nd\u016br on the north, Elgandal on the east, Medak on the south, and Bidar and N\u0101nder on the west, and between 18\u00b0 5' and 19\u00b0 30' N. and 77\u00b0 40' and 79\u00b0 0' E. It has an area of 4,822 square miles, including j\u0101gir and paig\u0101h lands, the area of the kh\u0101lsa lands being 3,574 square miles. A range of hills runs through the north between N\u0101nder and Elgandal. There are also minor ranges in the west and east. The largest river is the God\u0101vari, which enters from the adjoining District of N\u0101nder on the west, and, after traversing the northern portion for about 70 miles, passes into Elgandal District. The M\u0101njra, the chief tributary of the God\u0101vari, crosses the District from the south-west and joins the God\u0101vari near Kandkurti in the Bodhan t\u0101luk, after a course of 62 miles. The Pengang\u0101 forms the boundary between the Nars\u0101pur t\u0101luk in the north and the Pusad t\u0101luk of Ber\u0101r. Smaller rivers are the Siddha in the Nars\u0101pur t\u0101luk, the Phul\u0101ng in the Ind\u016br and Arm\u016br t\u0101luks, and the S\u016bran, which passes through Nars\u0101pur and Nirmal. All these\n\n\u00b9 This District ceased to exist in 1905. See section on Population and the article on NIZAMABAD DISTRICT, which has taken its place.\nare tributaries of the God\u0101vari. The Yedlakatta V\u0101g\u016b is a small perennial stream in K\u0101m\u0101reddipet.\n\nThe rocks belong to the Archaean and the Deccan trap formations, the former occupying the larger area. The Deccan trap occurs principally along the northern frontier.\n\nThe chief trees are teak, black-wood, ebony, nall\u0101maddi (Terminalia tomentosa), eppa (Hardwickia binata), bij\u0101s\u0101l (Pterocarpus Marsupium), and tarvar (Cassia auriculata).\n\nAll the t\u0101luks except Mudhol are largely overgrown with jungle, giving cover to tigers, bears, leopards, cheetahs, wild dogs, hyenas, wild hog, s\u0101mbar, spotted deer, and nilgai.\n\nFrom February to the end of May the climate is dry and healthy, but during the monsoons and the cold season it is damp and malarious, giving rise to fever and ague. The temperature ranges between $40^\\circ$ in December and $110^\\circ$ in May. In the Nirmal t\u0101luk the water is bad, and dropsy and malarial fevers are common. The annual rainfall for the twenty years ending 1901 averaged 42 inches.\n\nThe District was conquered by Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn Khilji in 1311. Later it formed part of the Bahmani, and subsequently of the Kutb Sh\u0101hi kingdoms; and on the fall of the latter was annexed by Aurangzeb to the Mughal empire, from which it was separated on the foundation of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, early in the eighteenth century.\n\nChief among the archaeological and historical remains of the District may be mentioned the fort of Nirmal. The surrounding country is literally dotted with hills, the majority of which still bear signs of former fortifications. The main defences which surround Nirmal are of European design and construction, having been built by French officers in the Niz\u0101m\u2019s service. South-west of the town of Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d are the remains of a great fortified temple known as the fort of Ind\u016br, which has now been converted into a Central jail. There are two old and richly carved temples at the village of Yell\u0101reddipet, with an abundance of figure sculpture adorning both. Ten miles south of Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d, at the small village of Gaursamudram, are the tombs of three Armenians, dating from the latter part of the seventeenth century.\n\nThe number of towns and villages in the District is 1,159. The population at each Census during the last twenty years was: (1881) 577,264, (1891) 639,598, and (1901) 634,588. The famine of 1899\u20131900 accounts for the decline of population in the last decade. The chief towns are Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d, Arm\u016br, Nirmal, Bodhan, Mudhol, Kondalw\u0101di, and B\u0101lkonda, the last two being in a paig\u0101h and a j\u0101gir respectively. Ind\u016br is the District head-quarters. More than 91 per cent. of the population are Hindus, and nearly all the rest Musalm\u0101ns. About 78 per cent. of the\npopulation speak Telugu. The following table gives the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Taluk       | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1901 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Indur       | 415                  | 1               | 69       | 52,778     | 127                       | + 1.0                                                    | Not available                          |\n| Nirmal      | 500                  | 1               | 100      | 41,351     | 83                        | - 16.4                                                   |                                        |\n| Armur       | 479                  | 1               | 72       | 50,717     | 106                       | - 2.9                                                    |                                        |\n| Bingal      | 311                  | 1               | 37       | 29,568     | 95                        | + 2.2                                                    |                                        |\n| Kamareddipet| 338                  | 1               | 71       | 43,375     | 128                       | + 2.4                                                    |                                        |\n| Yellareddipet| 172                 | 1               | 70       | 27,574     | 160                       | - 3.6                                                    |                                        |\n| Banswada    | 319                  | 1               | 65       | 37,972     | 119                       | + 2.8                                                    |                                        |\n| Bodhan      | 237                  | 1               | 42       | 31,668     | 133                       | + 4.1                                                    |                                        |\n| Mudhol      | 282                  | 1               | 90       | 42,640     | 151                       | - 11.1                                                   |                                        |\n| Narsapur    | 521                  | 1               | 133      | 48,489     | 93                        | - 0.8                                                    |                                        |\n| Jagirs, etc.| 1,248                | 2               | 403      | 228,516    | 175                       | - 2.2                                                    |                                        |\n| District total | 4,822              | 7               | 1,152    | 634,588    | 131                       | - 1.3                                                    | 13,519                                 |\n\nIn 1905 the taluks of Nirmal and Narsapur were transferred to the new District of Adilabad, and Mudhol and part of Banswada to Nander. The rest of Banswada was divided between Bodhan and Yellareddipet, while Bingal was merged in Armur. Other changes were made in Yellareddipet and Kamareddipet, and the District in its new shape is known as Nizamabad.\n\nThe purely agricultural castes number 175,600, or about 28 per cent. of the population, the most important being Kapus (83,000), Munnurs (40,000), and Kolis (30,000). Next come the Dhangars or shepherds (36,000), and the Baniyas or trading castes, consisting mainly of Komatis (13,800) and Vanis (17,000). There are 11,500 Brahmins. The weaver castes comprise Salaris (12,000), Julahas (13,600), and Koshtis (5,100). The Bestas or palki-bearers number 17,000. There are also 12,000 Lammans or grain-carriers. Among the low castes are Malas or Dhers (64,000), and Mangs or Chamars who are leather-workers (32,000). These last also work as field-labourers. The Kalals or toddy-drawers number about 12,000. More than 51 per cent. of the population are dependent on the land.\n\nA Methodist Mission was started at Kanteshwar close to Nizamabad in 1899, which manages two schools and a carpenter's workshop. Native Christians numbered 32 in 1901, of whom 2 were Methodists.\n\nIn the taluks of Narsapur and Mudhol regar or black cotton soil predominates, while masab, kharab, and chalika, which are mostly sandy, gravelly, and light-coloured soils, are found in the rest of the District. 'Wet' cultivation is not practised in these two taluks, while the existence of numerous tanks is\n\nAGRICULTURE.\na marked feature in the others. The soils at the foot of the hills and in valleys are generally very fertile.\n\nThe tenure of lands is entirely ryotw\u0101ri. In 1901, out of 3,574 square miles of kh\u0101lsa land, 1,042 were cultivated, 497 were occupied by fallows and cultivable waste, 1,388 by forests, and 647 were not available for cultivation. The staple food-crop is jow\u0101r, grown on 58 per cent. of the net area cropped. Next in importance is rice, covering 191 square miles. The other food-grains, such as kodro, lachhna, and maize, occupy 128 square miles; and cotton 34.\n\nThe ordinary breeds of cattle, ponies, sheep, and goats are met with throughout the District. The cattle reared in the hilly portions are more hardy than those of the plains, but both are small. The t\u0101luk of Nirmal was once noted for its fine cattle, supposed to have been introduced from Sirpur T\u0101nd\u016br. Two stallions are kept for improving the breed of horses, one at Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d and the other at K\u0101m\u0101reddipet.\n\nIn 1901, 119 square miles were irrigated. The principal irrigation channels take off from the Phul\u0101ng and S\u016bran rivers and the Yedla-katta stream, and supply some of the chief tanks. Other canals and channels are supplied from irrigation dams; and there are 635 large tanks, 837 kuntas or smaller tanks, and 3,112 wells in good working order.\n\nInd\u016br has large tracts of forests. Every t\u0101luk, except Mudhol, contains some forest lands, and the growth in Nirmal and Bimgal is dense. Teak, black-wood (Dalbergia latifolia), ebony (Diospyros melanoxylon), nall\u0101maddi (Terminalia tomentosa), eppa (Hardwickia binata), and bij\u0101s\u0101l (Pterocarpus Marsupium) grow well in these two t\u0101luks, producing timber of good scantling. The timber trees elsewhere are inferior, but supply railway sleepers and poles. Fuel is abundant in all the t\u0101luks except Mudhol, where the ryots plant bab\u016bl and n\u012bm trees. \u2018Reserved\u2019 forests cover 795 square miles, and unprotected forests 593.\n\nThe District possesses good basaltic and granitic building stone. The ironstone found in Bimgal and Arm\u016br is excellent, and sword-blades made from the Konasamudram (Arm\u016br t\u0101luk) steel were once famous for their strength and peculiar damascening.\n\nCoarse cotton cloth of every description is made throughout the District. In Arm\u016br, the Khatris weave various kinds of silk s\u0101ris and silk cloth, more than half of which, valued at Rs. 35,000 annually, is exported. In Bimgal and Nirmal, palanquins, trays, chairs and tables, toys and native playing-cards, leathern shields, and panels for screens are neatly painted with colours of local manufacture and with embossed patterns. Brass vessels, glass bangles, stone tumblers and cups are exported from these t\u0101luks, and also steel knives and other cutting instruments of\ngood finish. In the town of Indur, prayer cloths and pardas are printed; and scented hair oils and agar battis\\(^1\\) of a good quality are prepared. A rice-mill has lately been erected, which is capable of husking 11 tons of paddy daily, and employs 33 hands. The Mudhol taluk contains a ginning factory and a cotton-press driven by steam power. The former employs 76 and the latter 46 hands. Leather is tanned in the ordinary way by Chamars for the manufacture of water-buckets.\n\nThe principal exports consist of rice, gram, and other food-grains, cotton, oilseeds, oil, chillies, jaggery, tamarinds, cattle, bones and horns, tobacco, leather, tarvar bark for tanning, coarse cloth, silk saris, and brass vessels. The chief imports are cotton, silk and woollen cloth, salt, salted fish, opium, condiments, gold, silver, copper, brass, iron, kerosene oil, refined sugar, and raw silk. Trade is mainly with the adjoining Districts; but cotton, leather, tarvar bark, bones, horns, and oilseeds are sent to Bombay and Madras. Nizamabad is the chief centre of general trade, especially for those parts not served by the railway. Weekly bazars are held at the several taluk head-quarters, from which merchandise is distributed to distant parts of the District. The Komatis are the chief trading caste.\n\nThe Hyderab\u0101d-God\u0101vari Valley Railway traverses the District from the north-west to the south for 80 miles, with ten railway stations within its limits.\n\nAbout 142 miles of road are metalled with morum or gravel. The old N\u0101gpur trunk road from Hyderab\u0101d to N\u0101gpur in the Central Provinces crosses the District for 84 miles, and is maintained by the Public Works department. Another road, 39 miles long, runs from Nizam\u0101b\u0101d to B\u0101nsw\u0101da. There are four railway feeder-roads with an aggregate length of 19 miles, and ordinary country roads connect Nizam\u0101b\u0101d with the head-quarters of the taluks. The District is on the whole well supplied with communications.\n\nOwing to its large forest area and numerous wells and tanks, Indur has been fairly free from famine. In 1819, while there was famine in Gulbarga, Lingsugur, Bh\u012br, and Parbhani, only slight distress was experienced here. In the famine of 1833, though the people were not much affected, large numbers of cattle died for want of fodder. The great famine of 1899-1900, which was most seriously felt in the Aurang\u0101b\u0101d Division and Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, affected this District also, the rainfall in 1899 being only 16 inches, or less than two-fifths of the average. But as 1898 had been a good year, the ryots did not suffer acutely, though the loss to the State by remissions was great.\n\n\\(^1\\) Sticks composed of fragrant herbs, frankincense, and musk, which are burnt for their fragrance at religious ceremonials and sacrifices.\nThe District is divided into three subdivisions: one, consisting of the t\u0101luks of Bodhan and Yellareddipet, under a Third T\u0101lukd\u0101r; the second, comprising the t\u0101luks of K\u0101m\u0101reddipet and Arm\u016br, under a Second T\u0101lukd\u0101r; and the third, consisting of the Ind\u016br t\u0101luk only, under a Third T\u0101lukd\u0101r. Each t\u0101luk is under a tahsild\u0101r. The First T\u0101lukd\u0101r is the head of the District, having a general supervision over the work of all his subordinates.\n\nThe District civil court is presided over by a Civil Judge styled the N\u0101zim-i-Div\u0101ni, and the subordinate civil courts are those of the tahsild\u0101rs. The First T\u0101lukd\u0101r is the chief magistrate, and the District Civil Judge is also a joint-magistrate, exercising powers during the absence of the First T\u0101lukd\u0101r from head-quarters. The Second T\u0101lukd\u0101r exercises first-class magisterial powers, and the Third T\u0101lukd\u0101rs second-class powers, while the tahsild\u0101rs have third-class powers. There is little serious crime in ordinary times, but bad seasons lead to cattle-thefts and dacoities.\n\nLittle is known of the revenue history of the District. Formerly villages were made over to revenue farmers, who were allowed 10 per cent. for collections. They levied cash payments on 'dry' cultivation and sugar-cane, but for 'wet' crops they obtained a share in kind. In 1866, when the whole State was divided into Districts and t\u0101luks, revenue in kind was commuted to cash payments. A survey was completed in 1898, but the periods of settlement vary in the different t\u0101luks. Mudhol, Bodhan, Yellareddipet, K\u0101m\u0101reddipet, and B\u0101ns-w\u0101da were settled for fifteen years, Nirmal and Nars\u0101pur for ten, and Ind\u016br, Arm\u016br, and Bingal for seven years. The system followed resembles that of the Mysore settlement. The settlement caused an increase in the revenue of 5 per cent., while the survey showed that the area in holdings was greater than that recorded in the old accounts by 216 square miles. The average assessment on 'dry' land is Rs. 1-4 (maximum Rs. 2-0, minimum one anna), and on 'wet' land including gardens, Rs. 14 (maximum Rs. 24, minimum Rs. 3).\n\nThe land revenue and the total revenue of the District in recent years are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1881 | 1891 | 1901 | 1904 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Land revenue   | 14.60| 19.22| 18.53| 16.01|\n| Total revenue  | 23.68| 28.20| 24.31| 28.89|\n\nSince 1899 a cess of one anna in the rupee has been levied, and local boards established. The First T\u0101lukd\u0101r is the president of the District board, and the tahsild\u0101rs are chairmen of the subordinate t\u0101luk boards. At Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d there is a municipality, and each of the\nt\u0101luk head-quarters has a small conservancy establishment; the District and t\u0101luk boards manage the municipalities as well. The local board expenditure in 1901 was Rs. 71,725. The District Engineer has charge of all the roads and buildings constructed or maintained by the Public Works department. The Irrigation Engineer superintends the repair and construction of irrigation works.\n\nThe First T\u0101lukd\u0101r is the head of the police administration, with the Superintendent (Mohtamim) as his executive deputy. Under him are 10 inspectors, 115 subordinate officers, 684 constables, and 25 mounted police, distributed among 45 th\u0101nas and 43 outposts, except the mounted police who are at head-quarters.\n\nThe fort of Ind\u016br has been converted into a Central jail, and receives convicts sentenced to more than six months' imprisonment from the Districts of Medak, Mahbubnagar, Bidar, and Sirpur T\u0101nd\u016br. In 1901 there were 496 convicts in the Central jail. Female convicts are sent to the Warangal Central jail, as there is no separate accommodation here. Shatranjis, cotton-tweeds, counterpanes, towels, kh\u0101ki cloth, &c., are manufactured in large quantities. Tailors', carpenters', and blacksmiths' workshops are also at work, besides a printing press. All the cloth required for the convicts is manufactured in the jail, and surplus products are sold.\n\nThe District occupies a medium place as regards the literacy of its population, of whom 2.1 per cent. (4.1 males and 0.2 females) were able to read and write in 1901. The total number of pupils under instruction in 1881, 1891, 1901, and 1903 was 226, 1,496, 1,994, and 2,476 respectively. In 1903 there were 44 primary schools and one middle school, with 103 girls under instruction. The total expenditure on education in 1901 amounted to Rs. 12,278, of which Rs. 10,864 was met by the State and the remainder by local boards. The sum derived from fees was Rs. 780.\n\nThe District contained six dispensaries in 1901, with accommodation for 25 in-patients. The cases treated in that year numbered 30,794, of whom 142 were in-patients, and 612 operations were performed. The total expenditure amounted to Rs. 15,086, of which Rs. 13,694 was paid by the State and the balance was met from Local funds. The number of persons successfully vaccinated in 1901 was 1,110, or 1.75 per 1,000 of the population.\n\nIndus (Sanskrit, Sindhu; Greek, Sinthos; Latin, S\u012bndus).\u2014The great river of North-Western India, which rises in Tibet, and then flows through Kashmir, the North-west Frontier Province, and the Punjab, and after a final course through Sind falls into the Arabian Sea in 23\u00b0 58' N. and 67\u00b0 30' E. The drainage basin of the Indus is estimated at 372,700 square miles, and its total length at a little over 1,800 miles. The towns of importance on or near its banks in British\nterritory are, beginning from the south: Kar\u0101chi, Kotri, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, Sehw\u0101n, Sukkur, Rohri, Mithankot, Dera Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n, Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n, Mi\u0101nw\u0101li, K\u0101l\u0101b\u0101gh, Khush\u0101lgarh, and Attock.\n\nThe first section of the course of the Indus lies outside British territory, and must be dealt with briefly here. The river rises, as above stated, in Tibet (32\u00b0 N. and 81\u00b0 E.) behind the great mountain wall of the Him\u0101layas which forms the northern boundary of India, and is said to spring from the north side of the sacred Kail\u0101s mountain (22,000 feet), the Elysium of ancient Sanskrit literature. Issuing from the ring of lofty mountains about Lake M\u0101nasarowar, whence also the Sutlej, the Brahmaputra, and the Kauri\u0101l\u0101 spring, it flows north-west for about 160 miles under the name of Singh-ka-b\u0101b, until it receives the Ghar river on its south-western bank. A short distance below the junction of the Ghar, the Indus, which is supposed to have an elevation of 17,000 feet at its source, enters the south-eastern corner of Kashmir at an elevation of 13,800 feet, flowing slowly over a long flat of alluvium. Following a steady north-by-west course it skirts Leh at a height of 10,500 feet and drops to 8,000 feet in Baltist\u0101n, just before it receives the waters of the Shyok river. At Leh it is joined by the Z\u0101sk\u0101r river, and is crossed by the great trade route into Central Asia via the Karakoram Pass. Early travellers like Dr. Thomson and Mr. Blane have described this portion of the Indus. The former found numerous hot springs, some of them with a temperature of 174\u00b0 and exhaling a sulphurous gas. Still flowing north, but more westerly, through Kashmir territory, it passes near Sk\u0101rdu in Baltist\u0101n, and reaches the Haramosh mountain (24,300 feet) in about 34\u00b0 50\u2032 N. and 74\u00b0 30\u2032 E. Here it takes a turn southwards at an acute angle, and passing beneath the Hattu P\u012br, at an elevation of 4,000 feet, enters Kohist\u0101n in the Dir, Swat, and Chitr\u0101l Agency near Gur. The steepness of its fall varies, now becoming greater, now less. This inequality of slope has been connected with the changes that occurred in the glacial period from the damming of the river by huge glaciers and the formation of great thicknesses of lacustrine deposit. The Indus has been the cause of serious and disastrous floods; the rapid stream dashes down gorges and wild mountain valleys, and in its lower and more level course it is swept by terrific blasts. Even in summer, when it is said to dwindle down to a fordable depth during the night, it may in the course of the day swell into an impassable torrent from the melting of the snows on the adjoining heights. Opposite Sk\u0101rdu in Baltist\u0101n it is, even in the depth of winter, a grand stream, often more than 500 feet wide and 9 or 10 feet in depth. After leaving Gur, it flows for about 120 miles south-west through the wilds of Kohist\u0101n, until it enters the North-West Frontier Province (35\u00b0 25\u2032 N. and 73\u00b0 51\u2032 E.) near Darband, at the western base of the Mah\u0101ban mountain. The only\npoint to which special allusion can be made in the long section of its course beyond British territory is the wonderful gorge by which the river bursts through the western ranges of the Him\u0101layas. This gorge is near Sk\u0101rdu, and is said to be 14,000 feet in sheer descent.\n\nThe Indus, on entering the Haz\u0101ra District of the North-West Frontier Province, 812 miles from its source, is about 100 yards wide in August, navigable by rafts, but of no great depth, and studded with sandbanks and islands. It is fordable in many places during the cold season; but floods or freshes are sudden, and Ranjit Singh is said to have lost a force, variously stated at from 1,200 to 7,000 horsemen, in crossing the river. Even the large and solid ferry-boats which ply upon it are sometimes swept away. Almost opposite Attock it receives the K\u0101bul River, which brings down the waters of Mgh\u0101nist\u0101n. The two rivers have about an equal volume; both are very swift, and broken up with rocks. Their junction during floods is the scene of a wild confusion of waters. The K\u0101bul river is navigable for about 40 miles above the confluence, but a rapid just above it renders the Indus impracticable. Attock, the limit of the upward navigation of the Indus, forms the first important point on the river within British territory. By this time it has flowed upwards of 860 miles, or nearly one-half of its total length, its further course to the sea being about 940 miles. It has fallen from an elevation of 17,000 feet at its source in Tibet to about 2,000 feet, the height of Attock being 2,079 feet. In the hot season, opposite the fort, its velocity is 13 miles an hour; and in the cold season, 5 to 7 miles. The rise of ordinary floods is from 5 to 7 feet in twenty-four hours, and the maximum is 50 feet above cold-season level. Its width varies greatly with the season, at one time being more than 250 yards, at another less than 100. The Indus is crossed at Attock by the railway bridge opened in 1883, by a bridge of boats, and by a ferry. The main trunk road to Pesh\u0101war also crosses the river by a subway on the railway bridge.\n\nAfter leaving Attock, the Indus flows almost due south, forming the western boundary of the Punjab, parallel to the Sulaim\u0101n Hills. The great north road from Bannu to Sind runs for several hundred miles parallel with its western bank; and from Attock to Mahm\u016bd Kot the M\u0101ri-Attock, M\u0101ri, and Sind-S\u0101gar sections of the North-Western Railway run along its eastern bank. Twelve miles below Attock the Indus receives the waters of the Haroh, a rapid stream which, rising in the Murree hills as the Dh\u0101nd, meets the Karr\u0101l coming down from the Mochpuri peak, and rushes through steep banks for a total length of 90 miles. At Makhad, the Soh\u0101n brings in all the drainage of R\u0101walpindi and Jhelum Districts that is not taken by the Jhelum river. The Indus forms the eastern border of the two frontier Districts of Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n in the North-West Frontier Province and Dera\nGh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n in the Punjab with the Sind-S\u0101gar Do\u0101b on its eastern bank, and only a narrow strip of British territory between it and the hill tribes of the Sulaim\u0101n ranges on the west. Just above Mithankot, in the south of Dera Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n District, it receives the accumulated waters of the Punjab. Between the Indus and the Jumna flow the five great streams from which the Punjab (Panj-\u0101b, literally \u2018The five waters\u2019) takes its name. These are the Jhelum, the Chenab, the R\u0101vi, the Be\u0101s, and the Sutlej. After various junctions these unite to form the Panjnad river, literally \u2018The five streams,\u2019 which marks for a short space the boundary between British territory and the Bah\u0101walpur State, and unites with the Indus near Mithankot, about 490 miles from the sea. In the cold season the breadth of the Indus above the confluence is about 600 yards, its velocity 5 miles an hour, its depth from 12 to 15 feet, and its estimated discharge 10,000 to 25,000 cubic feet per second. During flood-times the breadth sometimes increases to 5 miles, and the discharge to 1,000,000 cubic feet per second. The dimensions of the Panjnad above the point of junction are somewhat less than those of the Indus during the cold season, but during the monsoon floods they are almost as large. The whole course of the Indus through the Punjab is broken by islands and sandbanks; but beautiful scenery is afforded along its banks, which abound with the date, acacia, pomegranate, and other trees.\n\nMithankot has an elevation of only 258 feet above the level of the sea. From Mithankot the Indus forms the boundary between the Punjab and the Bah\u0101walpur State, until, near Kashmor, it enters Sind in 28\u00b0 26\u2032 N. and 69\u00b0 47\u2032 E. From Bukkur (in Sind) to the sea the river is known familiarly among the people of the province as the Dary\u0101 (\u2018the river\u2019). Pliny writes of Indus incolis Sindus appellatus. It first touches Sind in the Upper Sind Frontier District, separating it from the Bah\u0101walpur State and Sukkur District. Formerly in years of high inundation its floods reached Jacob\u0101bad, finding their way thence into the Manchhar Lake. To prevent this, the Kashmor embankment, which is the largest in Sind, was erected. Leaving Kashmor the river crosses Sukkur, divides L\u0101rk\u0101na and Kar\u0101chi from the Khairpur State and Hyder\u0101b\u0101d District, finally emptying itself by many mouths into the Arabian Sea near Kar\u0101chi after a south-western course of 450 miles through Sind. It ranges in width from 480 to 1,600 yards, the average during the low season being 680 yards. During the floods it is in places more than a mile wide. Its depth varies from 4 to 24 feet. The water, derived from the snows of the Him\u0101layas, is of a dirty brown colour, and slightly charged with saline ingredients, carbonate of soda, and nitrate of potash. Its velocity in the freshes averages 8 miles per hour; at ordinary times, 4 miles. The discharge per second varies between a minimum of 19,000 and\na maximum of 820,000 cubic feet. On an average the temperature of the water is 10\u00b0 lower than that of the air. Near the station of Sukkur and again at Kotri the river is spanned by a fine railway bridge. The Sukkur bridge was opened in 1889, and resembles the Forth Bridge in having a central girder with a span of 200 feet, supported at the ends of two cantilever arms, each 310 feet long. The Indus begins to rise in March, attains its maximum depth and width in August, and subsides in September. The maximum rise registered at Kotri, near Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, was 22 feet 7 inches in 1894. There are many other gauges on the river.\n\nThe delta of the Indus covers an area of about 3,000 square miles, and extends along the coast-line for 125 miles. It is almost a perfect level, and nearly destitute of timber, the tamarisk and mangrove alone supplying fuel. In these respects the delta is similar to that of the Nile, but dissimilar to that of the Ganges. The marshy portions contain good pasturage, and rice grows luxuriantly wherever cultivation is possible; but the soil generally is not fertile, being a mixture of sand and clay. In the Sh\u0101hbandar taluka are immense deposits of salt. The climate of the delta is cool and bracing in the winter months, hot in the summer, and during the floods most unhealthy.\n\nThe Indus formerly flowed down the middle of the Thal. Basira, a village in the centre of the Muzaffargarh Thal, was called Bet Basira: and at Sh\u0101hgarh, near the southern end of the Thal, a long lake still exists which once formed the Indus bed. In 1800 the river at the apex of the delta divided into two main streams, known as the Baghi\u0101r and Sit\u0101; but in 1837 it had entirely deserted the former channel. The Khedew\u0101ri passage also, which before 1819 was the highway of water traffic to Sh\u0101hbandar, was in that year closed by an earthquake. In 1837 the Kakaiw\u0101ri, which had then increased from a shallow creek to a river with an average width at low water of 770 yards, was recognized as the highway; but before 1867 this also was completely blocked. In 1897 the river suddenly cut 3 miles inland, north of Rohri, destroying the cultivated fields and the Mando-Dahiro road. Tando Nij\u0101bat on the right bank and Mithani on the left have been swept away four times and rebuilt farther off. For the present the Haj\u0101mro, which before 1845 was navigable only by the smallest boats, is the main estuary of the Indus. The shape of the Haj\u0101mro is that of a funnel, with the mouth to the sea; on the east side of the entrance is a beacon 95 feet high, visible for 2 miles; and two well-manned pilot boats lie inside the bar to point out the difficulties of navigation.\n\nThe following facts illustrate further the shifting nature of the Indus. In 1845 Ghor\u0101b\u0101ri, then the chief commercial town of the delta, was on the river bank; but in 1848 the river deserted its bed.\nThe town of Keti was built on the new bank. The new bank was over-\nflowed a few years later, and a second Keti had to be built farther off.\nAt present one of the chief obstructions to navigation is a series of\nrocks between Tatta and Bhim\u0101n-jo-pura, which in 1846 were 8 miles\ninland. In 1863 a thousand acres of the Dh\u0101reja forest were swept\naway. The rapidity and extent of the destructive action in constant\nprogress in the delta may be estimated from the fact that travellers\nhave counted by the reports as many as thirteen bank slips in\na minute. In some places the elephant-grass (*Typha elephantina*)\ndoes good service by driving its roots very deeply (often 9 feet) into\nthe ground, and thereby holding it together.\n\nThe entire course of the Indus in British territory, from Attock to\nthe sea, lies within the zone of deficient rainfall, the annual average\nbeing nowhere higher than 10 inches. Cultivation, therefore, is\nabsolutely dependent upon artificial irrigation, almost to as great an\nextent as in the typical example of Egypt. But the Indus is a less\nmanageable river than the Nile. Its main channel is constantly\nshifting; at only three places\u2014Sukkur, Jerruck, and Kotri\u2014are the\nriver banks permanent; and during the season of flood the melted\nsnows of the Him\u0101layas come down in an impetuous torrent which no\nembankment can restrain. From time immemorial this annual inun-\ndation, which is to Sind what the monsoons are to other parts of India,\nhas been utilized as far as possible by an industrious peasantry, who\nlead the water over their fields by countless artificial channels. Many\nsuch channels, constructed in the days of native rule, extend 30 and\neven 40 miles from the river bank. Recently the systematic schemes\nof British engineers have added numerous perennial canals, such as\nthe J\u0101mr\u0101o, constructed on scientific principles. The first recorded\ninundation of the Indus took place in 1833; another occurred in 1841\non a much larger scale. This flood was said to have been caused by\nthe bursting of a glacier which formed over an accumulation of water\nin the Nubra Tso, into which there was a regular and steady flow from\nthe surrounding hills. Eventually, the glacier was burst asunder by\nthe pressure, and the released floods poured down the Shyok valley,\ncarrying everything before them. There was another great flood in\nAugust, 1858, when the river rose 90 feet in a few hours, and the\ngreater part of the private property in Naushahra cantonment was\ndestroyed. Lower down in its course considerable damage has been\ncaused in Dera Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n District, where protective works were\nundertaken. Of recent years the Indus has been embanked from\nabove Kashmor to the mouth of the Beg\u0101ri Canal, a distance of more\nthan 50 miles. The embankment has proved a great protection to\nthe North-Western Railway, which here runs at right angles to the\nriver.\nA full account of irrigation in Sind will be found in the article on that province. It must suffice in this place to give a list of the principal works, following the Indus downwards from the Punjab. The country has recently been surveyed with a view to a canal being led from Kalabagh down the Sind-Sagar Doab, but the difficulties in the way are at present considerable. The waters of the river are first utilized on a large scale in the Indus Inundation Canals, which water a narrow strip between the Indus and the Sulaiman mountains. The canals in this tract have an aggregate length of 690 miles, of which 108 have been constructed under British rule. In Muzaffargarh District the Muzaffargarh Canals take off from the Indus and Chenab, and in the Native State of Bahawalpur the Chenab and Sutlej, as well as the Indus, contribute to render cultivation possible. In Sind the following are the chief canal systems: on the right or west bank, the Desert, Unar Wah, Begari, Sukkur, Ghar, and Western Nara; on the left or east, the Nara Supply Channel, Mahi Wah, Jamrao, a branch of the Eastern Nara, and the Eastern Nara with many distributaries, the principal being the Mitrao and Pinjari. Other important canals are the Fuleli with two mouths, the Nasrat, and the Dad. The total area irrigated by canals from the Indus in 1903-4 was: in the Punjab, 714 square miles; in Sind, 4,925 square miles.\n\nAs a channel of navigation, the Indus has disappointed the expectations that were at one time formed. Before British arms had conquered Sind and the Punjab, it was hoped that the fabled wealth of Central Asia might be brought by this course down to the sea. But, even so far as local traffic is concerned, experience has proved in this case, as with most other Indian rivers, that the cheapness of water communication cannot compete with the superior speed and certainty of railways. Since the opening of the Indus Valley State Railway (now included in the North-Western system) in the autumn of 1878, navigation on the Indus, whether by steamer or by native boat, has greatly fallen off. The general character of the Indus trade may be inferred from the statistics of imports and exports into the Punjab by 'rail and river,' which refer only to traffic borne in part or wholly on the Indus. The original 'Indus flotilla,' which was broken up in 1862, placed its first steamer on the river in 1835. In 1859 a company established another Indus flotilla in connexion with the Sind Railway, with which it was formally amalgamated in 1870, the joint head-quarters being removed to Lahore. The railway flotilla was abolished in 1882-3. These were not the only navigation experiments on the Indus. In 1856 the Oriental Inland Steam Company obtained a yearly subsidy of Rs. 50,000 from Government; but, as the river current proved too powerful for its steamers, the company stopped the traffic, and eventually collapsed.\nFor the conservancy of the lower part of the river, Act I of 1863 (Bombay) provides for the registration of vessels, and the levy of pilotage fees by an officer called the Conservator and Registrar of the Indus, the sum realized being expended on the improvement of navigation\\(^1\\). A special export board, known as the Indus Commission, was constituted in 1901.\n\nThe boats of the Indus are the *dundo* and *zaurak*, both cargo-boats, the *kauntal*, or ferry-boats, and the *dundi*, or fishing-boats. The cargo-boats are sometimes of 60 tons burden, and when laden draw 4 feet of water. The state barges or *jhampits* of the Sind Mirs were built of teak, four-masted, and sometimes required crews of thirty men.\n\nFish abound. At the mouths, the salt-water varieties include the *Clupea neozehii*, a species of herring largely consumed along the coast and in the delta. The chief of the fresh-water varieties are the *palla*, placed by Dr. Day under the *Clupeidae*, and nearly allied to, if not identical with, the *hilsa* of the Ganges; and the *dambhro*. The local consumption and also the export of dried *palla* are very large. Otters, turtles, porpoises, water-snakes, and crocodiles, of both the blunt-nosed and sharp-nosed species, are numerous.\n\n[Notes on the Indus River (Karachi, 1901).]\n\n**Indus Inundation Canals.**\u2014An Imperial system of inundation canals in the Punjab, taking off from the west bank of the Indus, and irrigating part of Dera Ghazi Khan District. They are fourteen in number and cover a river frontage of 175 miles, protecting a low-lying narrow strip of country from 6 to 16 miles wide, known as the Sind. These were mostly constructed by the Mirani chiefs and other native rulers, and were greatly improved by Sawan Mal, governor under Ranjit Singh. Five, however, were constructed by Baloch chiefs in 1862\u20133 for the use of their tribal lands, but proving a financial failure were bought up by Government. The gross area commanded is 1,374 square miles, of which 661 are cultivable. The greatest area of crops matured is 348 square miles, and the average about 300 square miles. The normal period of flow is from the beginning of May to the end of September; consequently, while the autumn crop is matured entirely by canal water, the supply in the spring harvest is sufficient only for ploughing and sowing, after which wells are used. The average discharge of the whole series is 2,400 cubic feet per second. There are 680 miles of main canals and branches, of which 108 have been constructed under British rule, 75 miles of distributaries, and 7 of drainage cuts and escapes. As the irrigated tract is below the flood-level of the Indus, a system of embankments 75 miles long has been\n\n\\(^1\\) The Indus Conservancy department and fees levied for its upkeep were abolished in March, 1906.\nbuilt, and also works for training the river and protecting the irrigation works. The capital sum expended from 1854 to the end of March, 1904, is 8\u00b76 lakhs. Until 1897 there was practically no net revenue; in that year, by the revised settlement of Dera Ghazi Khan District, the indirect revenue was substantially increased and a low occupier's rate imposed. The gross revenue for 1903-4 was 4\u00b71 lakhs and the net revenue 1 lakh, or 11\u00b788 per cent. on the capital expenditure. A considerable income is derived from Government lands on the Dhundi canal.\n\n**Injaram.**\u2014Village in the Cocanada taluk of Godavari District, Madras, situated in 16\u00b0 44' N. and 82\u00b0 11' E., 5 miles south of Coringa on the Injaram Canal. Population (1901), 2,042. A factory was established here by the East India Company as early as 1708, and the place became famous for its fine cloths. It was captured by the French in 1757, but recovered in 1759, and remained a mercantile station down to 1829. In 1839 it suffered severely from a cyclone.\n\n**Insein Subdivision.**\u2014Subdivision of Hanthawaddy District, Lower Burma, comprising the Taikkyi and Insein townships.\n\n**Insein Township.**\u2014Township in Hanthawaddy District, Lower Burma, lying between 16\u00b0 47' and 17\u00b0 11' N. and 95\u00b0 49' and 96\u00b0 19' E., with an area of 482 square miles. The population was 86,247 in 1891 and 103,984 in 1901. The township is level and fertile, and has a density of 216 persons per square mile. It contains one town, Insein (population, 5,350), the head-quarters; and 478 villages. The area cultivated in 1903-4 was 324 square miles, paying Rs. 6,14,000 land revenue.\n\n**Insein Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision and township of the same name in Hanthawaddy District, Lower Burma, situated in 16\u00b0 53' N. and 96\u00b0 8' E., 10 miles north-west of Rangoon. Population (1901), 5,350. Insein is an important railway centre, containing the principal workshops of the Burma Railways Company. It has the largest jail in the Province, an engineering school, and a reformatory school. There is a frequent local train service to and from Rangoon, and, as a good deal of high land is suitable for building sites, Insein is becoming a popular residential suburb of the capital. The town was constituted a 'notified area' in 1903, and is administered by a committee of five members. The income of the town fund in 1904-5 amounted to Rs. 13,600, and the expenditure to Rs. 7,200.\n\n**Inthas.**\u2014A tribe scattered over the western and south-western portions of the Southern Shan States, Burma, and found in greatest number near Fort Stedman in the State of Yawngwe. In dress and appearance the Inthas closely resemble the Shans among whom they live, and to whom they are known as Anghsa. They are mainly distinguishable from their neighbours by their dialect, which is not Shan,\nbut appears to be an archaic form of Burmese, closely resembling Arakanese or Tavoyan. This resemblance has given rise to the theory that the Inthas originally came from Arakan. It seems, however, more probable that they are the descendants of one of the branches which broke off from the main Burmese stock about the same time that the Arakanese migrated to the western coast from the Irrawaddy. The early chronicles of the Tagaung kings refer to the separation of the Arakanese from the parent stem, and allude to the migration somewhat later of other parties, one of which went east and settled in what are now the Shan States. If the progeny of this party still exist, it is among the Inthas and Taungyos of the Shan States that they will probably be found. The Inthas are Buddhists. In 1901 they numbered 50,478 in the regularly enumerated areas, and it was calculated that there were about 700 in the 'estimated' areas of Karenni. At Fort Stedman they have a custom of building their houses over the water of the adjoining lake, sometimes at a very considerable distance from the shore. This practice has given them their name of Intha ('lake-dweller'). Their habit of rowing standing up and using the crook of their knees as a rowlock is peculiar.\n\n**Irinjalakuda.** Town in the Mukundapuram taluk of Cochin State, Madras, situated in 10\u00b0 22' N. and 76\u00b0 14' E. Population (1901), 8,420, of whom 5,240 are Hindus and 2,656 Christians. It is the head-quarters of the taluk, and contains the tahsildar's office, the Munsif's court, a high school, and several palaces. The most important institution in the town is the large and well-endowed temple of Kudalmannikkam, presided over by a Sudra Sanyasi, who by consecration is elevated to the status of a Brahman. He is designated Thachudaya Kaimal and is nominated by the ruler of Travancore.\n\n**Irrawaddy Division.**\u2014Division of Lower Burma, occupying the south-west corner of the province, between 15\u00b0 40' and 18\u00b0 31' N. and 94\u00b0 11' and 96\u00b0 6' E. On the north it is bounded by the Prome District of the Pegu Division; on the east by the Tharrawaddy and Hanthawaddy Districts of the same Division; on the south by the Bay of Bengal; and on the west by the Bay of Bengal and the Sandoway District of the Arakan Division. With the exception of the Arakan Yoma running down the western border, the whole Division is an alluvial plain, watered by a maze of rivers and creeks, all taking off from the Irrawaddy. It is divided into five Districts: Henzada in the north, Ma-ubin in the east, Pyapon in the south-east, Myaungmya in the south, and Bassein in the south-west.\n\nThe population of the Division was 680,315 in 1872, 989,978 in 1881, 1,300,119 in 1891, and 1,663,669 in 1901. The greater part of this very large increase is due to the steady flow of immigration from\nIndia, and also from the Districts of Upper Burma. The distribution of population in 1901\\(^1\\) is given in the table below:\n\n| District     | Area in square miles | Population, 1901 | Land revenue, 1903-4, in thousands of rupees |\n|--------------|----------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Bassein      | 4,127                | 391,427          | 13,79                                       |\n| Myaungmya    | 2,663                | 278,119          | 11,71                                       |\n| Ma-ubin      | 1,641                | 283,122          | 9,53                                        |\n| Pyapon       | 2,137                | 226,443          | 12,27                                       |\n| Henzada      | 2,870                | 484,558          | 12,40                                       |\n| **Total**    | **13,438**           | **1,663,669**    | **59,70**                                   |\n\nThe Division contains 7,185 villages and 16 towns. The headquarters are at Bassein (population, 31,864), which enjoys easy railway communication with Henzada, and river communication with the other District head-quarters. The other chief towns are Henzada (population, 24,756), and Yandoon in Ma-ubin District (12,779). Bassein is a town of considerable historical importance; but the Division as a whole never formed an independent political unit, and has taken no very prominent part in the events that have gone to mould the destinies of the people of Burma. The greater part of the population are Burmans, of whom there were 1,250,821 in 1901. Karens are well distributed throughout the Division, and in the same year numbered 299,119. The Pwo and Sgaw Karens are most numerous in Bassein and Myaungmya Districts, and in 1901 showed totals of 142,495 and 52,072 respectively. Talaings (34,394 in number) are strongest in Ma-ubin and Pyapon Districts and weakest in Henzada. A certain number of Arakanese, Chins, and Shans are also found. Chinese in 1901 numbered 8,070, and the Indian population consisted of 30,639 Hindus and 18,944 Musalmans. The number of Christians (54,823) is large, owing to the numerous Karen population.\n\nIrrawaddy River (Irawadi).\u2014The great river of Burma, formed by the junction of two streams, the N'maikha and Malikha, which rise in the hills in the extreme north of the Province at about the 28th parallel of latitude, and meet at a point about 30 miles north of the town of Myitkyina. From the confluence southwards the united stream, henceforth known as the Irrawaddy, divides Burma proper into two sections, east and west, and eventually empties itself, after a course of 900 miles, into the Bay of Bengal, west of Rangoon. The Irrawaddy is by far the best known of the natural features of the Province.\n\n\\(^1\\) Since the Census of 1901, the two former Districts of Myaungmya (area, 2,970 square miles; population, 303,274) and Thongwa (area, 3,471 square miles; population, 484,410) have been distributed into the three Districts of Myaungmya, Ma-ubin, and Pyapon, as shown in the table.\nNearly all the old capitals were built upon its banks. Its waters skirt more than half the Districts of Burma. Of the ten most populous towns, six\u2014namely, Mandalay, Prome, Bassein, Henzada, Myingyan, and Pakokku\u2014as well as important stations like Bhamo and Thayetmyo, lie on it, while Rangoon is directly connected with it by more than one waterway. From end to end it is navigable at one season of the year or the other for steam traffic.\n\nStarting from the confluence of the N'maikha and Malikha, and going south, the first affluent of importance is the Mogaung stream, which enters it from the west about 15 miles above Sinbo. Two miles above Bhamo, which lies on its left bank, its waters are swelled by those of the Taping from the east. The Taping rises in Chinese territory; and its source, which has not yet been ascertained with precision, cannot be far distant from that of the Shweli, the next large tributary of the Irrawaddy, which, traversing the State of M\u00f5ngmit, empties itself into the main stream 20 miles south of Kath\u00e3. From its junction with the Shweli, the Irrawaddy pursues its course southward. North of Mandalay it is joined by the Madaya stream from the east; and south of that city, opposite the old Burmese town of Sagaing, it makes an extensive bend to the west. At the curve the tortuous Mvitnge quits the gorges of the Shan States to join it from the east, and shortly after this it receives the waters of the Mu from the hills of Shwebo and Kath\u00e3 in the north. Curving southward again near Myingyan, it is joined immediately above Pakokku by its main tributary, the Chindwin, a stream almost its equal in volume, which likewise comes from the very north of the Province. South of its junction with the Chindwin the Irrawaddy is fed from the west by various small tributaries, rising in the Arakan Yoma and the Pakokku Chin Hills, of which the most noteworthy are the Yaw, Mon, and Man, and by a few minor streams from the direction of the Pegu Yoma; but after entering Lower Burma, little is added to its volume before it spreads out like a fan in the delta country in the neighbourhood of Henzada.\n\nA journey down the Irrawaddy would amply suffice to show to the traveller Burma in most of its varied guises. Emerging from its northern home in the Kachin Hills the river plunges, about 60 miles below the town of Myitkyin\u00e3, through the third defile, or \u2018the Gates of the Irrawaddy,\u2019 a succession of foaming stretches of water hemmed into an almost inconceivably narrow channel, which is impassable during the rains and not without its dangers in the dry season. From the Gates southwards high hills stand on either hand, sending their outlying slopes down to the water\u2019s edge. They recede somewhat in the neighbourhood of Bhamo, but between that town and Shwegu they throw a formidable barrier across the river. At this second defile\nthe current forces its way through an enormous rift in a rugged spur; and the river steamer swings through turbulent water at the foot of high grim crags down a passage so narrow that at each fresh bend the rocky walls ahead have the appearance from a distance of uniting and offering no outlet. South and west of the defile wide kaing-grass plains open out, to shut again above Kath\u0101, and thence marshy level and wooded hill slope alternately till somewhat to the north of Mandalay. Here, after the first defile (less imposing than the two northerly ones) has been passed, the high ground retires from the river to give place to the central plain of Burma, over which the Districts of the dry zone extend. For hours together all that can be seen beyond the blinding white banks and low sandy bluffs by the river's edge are rolling stretches of rocky land, covered with sparse undergrowth and backed by yellow sandstone ridges. Hills there are, but they are mostly remote. From Myingyan southwards Popa alone raises its mass above the plain; but it seems to have nothing in common with its environment, and its blue serves only to heighten the dusty glare of the thirsty land it looks down upon. With the approach to Prome, however, the dry belt is passed, vegetation thickens, each hour carries the traveller into areas of heavier rainfall; and by the time the delta is reached and the river spreads out towards the sea, all signs of rising ground have disappeared, and on every side plains of rich paddy-fields and flat stretches of jungle extend away to the horizon. The farther south the river flows, the oftener does it send off branches to meander through the fertile levels; and near the coast the country becomes a maze of turbid tidal creeks, flowing through dreary expanses of mangrove jungle.\n\nAs a source of irrigation, the value of the Irrawaddy is enormous. During the monsoon its waters rise and inundate all the low-lying ground in the vicinity of the channel. When they fall again in October and November, vast stretches of rich soil are left on and adjoining the banks, and on the many islands in the bed of the stream, which are suitable for rice, and for what is known as kaing cultivation. The river does not, however, supply water to any of the regular irrigation systems of the Province. In the delta the country adjoining its channel is protected from inundation by an elaborate system of embankments.\n\nA considerable portion of the internal trade of the country passes up and down the Irrawaddy. The steamers of the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company run throughout the greater part of its course, bringing down petroleum, tea, cotton, and grain from the up-country stations on its banks, and returning laden with cargoes of salt, piece-goods, and a number of other articles. Some of these boats are in themselves floating bazars, on which the river villages have learnt to depend\nfor a regular supply of commodities. Native boats, too, ply up and down, performing on a small scale similar commercial functions to those discharged by the Company, and throughout the year rafts of bamboo and timber are floated in enormous quantities down the stream. The Irrawaddy is the main source of water-supply to the towns and villages on its banks. At Prome there are systematic water-works by which the river water is distributed through the town. The river is tidal as far as Danubyu or Donabyu, about 70 miles from the coast. The Irrawaddy is nowhere bridged. At two points, between Amarapura and Sagaing, and between Tharrawaw and Henzada, it cuts across the line of railway and is crossed by a steam ferry. A railway bridge at the first of these ferries is in contemplation.\n\nIs\u0101garh Zila.\u2014District of the Gwalior State, Central India, lying between 24\u00b0 3' and 25\u00b0 12' N. and 76\u00b0 52' and 78\u00b0 20' E., with an area of 3,591 square miles. The population in 1901 was 248,679, giving a density of 75 persons per square mile. The district contains two towns, Mungaoli (population, 4,797), the head-quarters, and Guna (including the military station, 11,452); and 1,367 villages. The country on the eastern and western borders is hilly, while that in the centre of the tract is typical of the M\u0101lw\u0101 plateau. It is divided into four parganas, with head-quarters at Bajranggarh, Kumbhr\u0101j, Is\u0101garh, and Mungaoli. The land revenue is Rs. 4,97,000.\n\nIsa Khel Tahsil.\u2014Trans-Indus tahsil of Mi\u0101nw\u0101li District, Punjab, lying between 32\u00b0 30' and 33\u00b0 14' N. and 71\u00b0 7' and 71\u00b0 44' E., with an area of 678 square miles. It contains the municipalities of Isa Khel (population, 7,630), the head-quarters, and K\u0101l\u0101b\u0101gh (5,824); and 43 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to 1.6 lakhs. Lying on the west bank of the Indus, this tahsil is cut off from the rest of the District, and would seem to belong more properly to the North-West Frontier Province, but is separated even more completely from Bannu by the semicircular fringe of the Chich\u0101li and Maid\u0101ni hills, which leave it open only on the river side. These hills drain into Isa Khel and make it fertile. Its extreme northern portion, known as the Bhangi Khel country, is a wild and rugged region, a continuation of the Khattak hills. The Bhangi Khel are a soldierly, but numerically small, section of the great Khattak tribe, and occupied their present country about 400 years ago. The tahsil derives its name from the Isa Khel tribe, a section of the Ni\u0101zai Afgh\u0101ns, who, settling here during the sixteenth century, long maintained their independence of the Mughal empire, and at last succumbed to the Naw\u0101b of Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n.\n\nIsa Khel Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Mi\u0101nw\u0101li District, Punjab, situated in 32\u00b0 42' N. and 71\u00b0 17' E., on the right bank of the Indus, about 8 miles west of the present main\nchannel. Population (1901), 7,630. The town was founded about 1830 by Ahmad Kh\u0101n, ancestor of the present Kh\u0101ns of Isa Khel, who are the acknowledged heads of the trans-Indus Ni\u0101zai; and it takes its name from Sh\u0101h Isa Khel, a religious teacher, whose descendants still live in the town. The municipality was created in 1875. The income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 4,400. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 5,100, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 4,600. A small cattle market is held weekly. The town contains a dispensary and a municipal vernacular middle school.\n\nIsl\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d.\u2014Town in the State of Kashmir, situated in $33^\\circ 44' N.$ and $75^\\circ 12' E.$, about a mile from the right bank of the Jhelum, near the point where that river becomes navigable. Population (1901), 9,390. It lies under an elevated table-land, on the edge of which rises a conical hill, overlooking the town. From its foot flows a vigorous spring, the Anantn\u0101g, a name applied to the town by Hindus. There are numerous other springs, one of which, the Malikn\u0101g, is sulphurous, and its water is highly prized for garden cultivation. Some of the inhabitants are shawl-weavers, but a large number are engaged in agriculture. It is generally believed that Isl\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d was once a large and prosperous place, though now there are few signs of prosperity or growth. The sanitation has been much neglected, and this constitutes a danger to the health of the capital, Srinagar.\n\nIsl\u0101mnagar.\u2014Town in the Bisauli taluk of Budaun District, United Provinces, situated in $28^\\circ 20' N.$ and $78^\\circ 44' E.$, 6 miles south-east of the Bahjoi station on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. Population (1901), 6,367. During the Mutiny, in May, 1858, there was a skirmish near this place between a body of rebels and the troops of the loyal Naw\u0101b of R\u0101mpur, the latter being victorious. The town is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,500. It is the chief market in the neighbourhood for agricultural produce, and there is a large export of raw sugar. It contains a dispensary and a middle school with 112 pupils.\n\nIsl\u0101mpur.\u2014Town in S\u0101t\u0101ra District, Bombay Presidency. See Ur\u016bn-Isl\u0101mpur.\n\nIst\u0101l\u012bf.\u2014Town in the K\u0101bul province of Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, situated in $34^\\circ 59' N.$ and $69^\\circ 5' E.$, 20 miles north-north-west of K\u0101bul city. The population, including that of seven villages depending on it, comprises from 15,000 to 18,000 souls. The inhabitants are T\u0101jiks, Ghilzais, Kizilb\u0101shis, and about fifty families of Sikh shopkeepers. The T\u0101jiks of Ist\u0101l\u012bf, contrary to the usual habits of these people, are among the most turbulent in the country. They have the reputation also of being the best foot-soldiers in Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, and are a healthy and handsome race, fond of sport and war.\nThe place is singularly picturesque and beautiful. It is built on the side of the hills in the form of a pyramid, the houses rising one above the other in terraces, the whole being crowned by magnificent chin\u0101rs (planes) which surround the shrine of Hazrat Eshan, while far below, in a deep glen, a foaming brook rushes over a bed of rocky boulders, on both sides of which the valley is covered with the richest orchards and vineyards. 'The people of the country have a proverb that he who has not seen Ist\u0101lif has seen nothing; and certainly it may be allowed that he who has seen Ist\u0101lif is not likely to see many places to surpass it, and few to equal it.' Nearly every householder has his garden or orchard, to which the families repair in the fruit season, closing their houses in the town. A great part of the population is of the weaver class, and quantities of coarse cloths are manufactured, a trade in which is maintained with Turkist\u0101n.\n\nIst\u0101lif was destroyed in September, 1842, by a force under General McCaskill, on account of its having harboured several chiefs implicated in the murder of Sir A. Burnes at K\u0101bul and in the massacre of the garrison of Ch\u0101rik\u0101r.\n\n**Iswaripur.**\u2014Village in the S\u0101tkhira subdivision of Khuln\u0101 District, Bengal, situated in $22^\\circ 19'$ N. and $89^\\circ 7'$ E., on the Jamun\u0101 river. Population (1901), 362. It was formerly known as Yasohara, and was in the seventeenth century the capital of R\u0101j\u0101 Prat\u0101p\u0101ditya, the popular hero of the Sundarbans.\n\n[Report on Jessore by Sir J. Westland (Calcutta, 1874), p. 23.]\n\n**Itaria.**\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\n**It\u0101rsi.**\u2014Town in the District and tahsil of Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d, Central Provinces, situated in $22^\\circ 37'$ N. and $77^\\circ 47'$ E., on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway to Jubbulpore, 464 miles from Bombay and 936 from Calcutta. It is also the junction for the Indian Midland section to Cawnpore and Agra. Its population in 1901 was 5,769, and it is rapidly increasing in importance, the number having nearly doubled during the previous decade. It\u0101rsi is the leading goods station in Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d District, receiving not only a considerable share of the local produce, but also nearly the whole of that of Bet\u016bl District. It has a large weekly cattle market, at which numbers of cattle are sold for slaughter. It\u0101rsi contains an English middle school, maintained by the Friends Foreign Mission, and two primary schools.\n\n**Itim\u0101dpur Tahsil.**\u2014Northern tahsil of Agra District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of the same name, lying between $27^\\circ 5'$ and $27^\\circ 24'$ N. and $77^\\circ 58'$ and $78^\\circ 22'$ E., with an area of 277 square miles. It was formerly known as Khandauli. Population increased from 153,761 in 1891 to 159,881 in 1901. There are 180 villages and two towns, Itimadpur (population, 5,322), the\n\n---\n\n1 Masson, Narrative of Journeys in Baluchistan, Afghanistan, &c.\ntahsil head-quarters, and T\u00fcndla (3,044). The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 3,10,000, and for cesses Rs. 38,000. The density of population, 574 persons per square mile, is about the same as the District average. The tahsil lies entirely north of the Jumna, and is crossed by the small river Jhirn\u0101 or Karon. Most of it forms a level upland of uniformly rich loam; but a network of ravines spreads inland from the Jumna and Jhirn\u0101, which are barren and of use only for grazing. Bordering on the river beds lies a small tract of alluvial soil, which often deteriorates to sand, capable of producing nothing but melons. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 205 square miles, of which 75 were irrigated, almost entirely from wells.\n\nItim\u0101dpur Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Agra District, United Provinces, situated in 27\u00b0 14' N. and 78\u00b0 12' E., on the main road from Agra city to Mainpuri, and 2\u00bd miles from the East Indian Railway junction at T\u00fcndla. Population (1901), 5,322. The town is named after its founder, Itim\u0101d Kh\u0101n, who built a large masonry tank here, and is said to have been a eunuch in the service of Akbar. It is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 900. Trade is purely local. The tahs\u012bl school has about 100 pupils, and a primary girls' school 16 pupils, and there is a branch of the American Methodist Mission.\n\nItwad.\u2014Petty State in Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\nJabalpur.\u2014Division, District, tahsil, and city in the Central Provinces. See Jubbulpore.\n\nJabooa.\u2014State in Central India. See Jh\u0101bua.\n\nJabria Bhil. Thakur\u0101t in the Bhop\u0101l Agency, Central India.\n\nJacob\u0101b\u0101d Taluka.\u2014Taluka of the Upper Sind Frontier District, Sind, Bombay, lying between 27\u00b0 56' and 28\u00b0 26' N. and 67\u00b0 59' and 68\u00b0 37' E., with an area of 460 square miles. It contains one town, Jacob\u0101b\u0101d (population, 10,787), head-quarters of the District and taluka; and 85 villages. The population in 1901 was 64,972, compared with 48,330 in 1891. This is the most thickly populated taluka in the District, the density being 141 persons per square mile. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to nearly 3.5 lakhs. The taluka is irrigated by the Beg\u0101ri Canal and its branches, and also to a slight extent by the Desert Canal.\n\nJacob\u0101b\u0101d Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the Upper Sind Frontier District, Sind, Bombay, situated in 28\u00b0 17' N. and 68\u00b0 29' E., on the Sind-Pishin branch of the North-Western Railway. Population (1901), 10,787, of whom 3,107 were in the cantonments. Jacob\u0101b\u0101d was planned and laid out, in 1847, by General John Jacob, for many years commandant of the Sind Horse, on the site of the village of Kh\u0101ngarh. The town is oblong in shape, 2 miles long by 1 mile broad, and is watered by the R\u0101j Wah and Budhu Wah irrigation canals. Jacob\u0101b\u0101d\nis now the head-quarters of a regiment of native cavalry, as well as of the civil administration. In addition to the cantonments, civil and judicial courts, dispensary and jail, it also contains a Residency in which General Jacob resided, the tomb of General Jacob, who died here in 1858, the Victoria clock-tower built in 1887, and lines for the accommodation of trade caravans (k\u0101filas) from Central Asia. Here are also a cloth market and vegetable market, built by the municipality. The railway carries a considerable trade in grain, gh\u012b, and leather. The town was constituted a municipality in 1875. The income during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 57,300. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 70,000, composed chiefly of octroi (Rs. 32,000) and market fees (Rs. 17,000); while the expenditure was Rs. 76,000, including Rs. 22,000 spent on education, Rs. 16,000 on administrative charges, and Rs. 14,000 on roads. The income and expenditure of the cantonment fund in the same year were respectively Rs. 19,000 and Rs. 13,000.\n\nJ\u0101duk\u0101ta.\u2014River of Assam, which rises in the Kh\u0101si Hills, where it is known as the Kynchiang or Pan\u0101t\u012brtha, and after flowing west and south debouches on the plains of Sylhet. Here it divides into two main channels, that to the east being known as the P\u0101tlai and farther on as the Bolai, that to the west as the Piyain. Both of these branches fall into the K\u0101ngsa, and the united stream ultimately joins the Surm\u0101 in Mymensingh District a little to the west of Habiganj. The river is largely used as a trade route, affording an outlet for the products of the Kh\u0101si Hills. During the rainy season it is often unable to carry off the enormous quantities of water precipitated in its catchment area, and considerable damage is then done by floods. The total length of the river is 120 miles.\n\nJ\u0101far\u0101b\u0101d State.\u2014State in the K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r Political Agency, Bombay. It is a dependency of the Naw\u0101b of Janj\u012bra on the Konkan coast, and lies between 20\u00b0 52' and 20\u00b0 59' N. and 71\u00b0 24' and 71\u00b0 29' E., 170 miles south of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, 150 south-west of Baroda, and 165 north-west of Bombay, with an area of 42 square miles. The annual rainfall averages 25 inches.\n\nAbout 1731, when the Mughal power was much relaxed in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, J\u0101far\u0101b\u0101d was independent under the rule of its th\u0101n\u0101d\u0101rs. They and the Muhammadan garrison, joining with the local Kolis, &c., betook themselves to piracy and sorely harassed the trade and shipping of Surat. S\u012bd\u012b Hil\u0101l of the Janj\u012bra house, who was then employed at Surat, attacked them and destroyed their ships, and imprisoning many Kolis demanded a heavy fine from J\u0101far\u0101b\u0101d. The th\u0101n\u0101d\u0101rs, being unable to pay the fine, sold J\u0101far\u0101b\u0101d to S\u012bd\u012b Hil\u0101l. When S\u012bd\u012b Hil\u0101l perceived that he would not be able to retain the place, owing to the increased anarchy of the peninsula, he transferred it in 1762 to the\nNaw\u00e2b of Janjira, who paid his debts, amounting to Rs. 7,000, and sent him as governor on his behalf.\n\nThe population at the last four enumerations was: (1872) 8,549, (1881) 9,400, (1891) 12,389, and (1901) 12,097. In 1901 there were 9,863 Hindus and 2,225 Musalmans. The State contains one town and 11 villages. The chief crops are b\u00fbjra, cotton, and wheat, the cultivated area in 1903-4 being 24.7 square miles. Stone is quarried for building purposes. Coarse cotton cloth is manufactured. A m\u00e2mlatd\u00e2r with judicial and revenue authority resides at J\u00e2far\u00e2b\u00e2d on behalf of the Naw\u00e2b of Janjira, and the area ranks as a first-class State in K\u00e2thi\u00e2w\u00e2r. The gross revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 62,000, chiefly derived from land (Rs. 22,900) and customs (Rs. 12,500). There is only one municipality, namely, J\u00e2far\u00e2b\u00e2d Town. The State maintains a police force of 13 men, and has 9 schools with 374 pupils. The two dispensaries treated 6,000 patients in 1903-4. In the same year the number of persons vaccinated was 313.\n\nJ\u00e2far\u00e2b\u00e2d Town.\u2014Chief town of the State of the same name in K\u00e2thi\u00e2w\u00e2r, Bombay, situated in 20\u00b0 52' N. and 71\u00b0 25' E. Population (1901), 6,038. J\u00e2far\u00e2bad has great natural advantages for the coasting trade, being situated about a mile from the sea, on the estuary of the Ranai, the most accessible river on the coast of K\u00e2thi\u00e2w\u00e2r. The commerce of the port is only second in importance to that of Diu. The imports in 1903-4 amounted to 5.3 lakhs, and the exports to 3.3 lakhs. The town derives its name from Sult\u00e2n Muzaffar of Gujar\u00e2t, who built the fortifications, the name being a contraction of Muzaffar\u00e2b\u00e2d. It is now a dependency of the Naw\u00e2b of Janjira. A m\u00e2mlatd\u00e2r with judicial and revenue authority resides here on behalf of the Naw\u00e2b. The town is administered as a municipality, with an income of Rs. 1,400 in 1903-4.\n\nJag\u00e2dhri Tahsil.\u2014Eastern tahsil of Amb\u00e2la District, Punjab, lying at the foot of the Him\u00e2lkayas, between 30\u00b0 2' and 30\u00b0 28' N. and 77\u00b0 4' and 77\u00b0 36' E., with an area of 406 square miles. It is bounded on the south-east by the Jumna, which separates it from the United Provinces. The population in 1901 was 161,238, compared with 168,634 in 1891. It contains the towns of Jag\u00e2dhri (population, 13,462), the head-quarters, and B\u00fbr\u00eeva (5,865); and 379 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to 2.9 lakhs. The tahsil includes a small tract of hilly country in the Siw\u00e2lik. On the east lie the Junna lowlands. The rest is generally level or gently undulating, and is intersected by torrent-beds.\n\nJag\u00e2dhri Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Amb\u00e2la District, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 10' N. and 77\u00b0 18' E., about 5 miles north of the North-Western Railway, on the metalled road connecting Amb\u00e2la and Sah\u00e2ranpur. Population (1901), 13,462. It\nowes its importance to the Sikh chief Rai Singh of B\u016briya, who settled a commercial and manufacturing population here. The town had been entirely destroyed by N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h, but was rebuilt by Rai Singh in 1783. It lapsed to the British Government in 1829. The name is said to be a corruption of Gang\u0101 Dhair, so called from a store of Ganges water enshrined in its foundations. Jag\u0101dhri is noted for its manufacture of iron and brass-ware. Borax, imported from the hills, is also refined, and oxide of lead manufactured. The municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 24,700, and the expenditure Rs. 24,300. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 25,700, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 25,500. It maintains an Anglo-vernacular high school and a dispensary.\n\n**Jagal\u016br.**\u2014Northern taluk of Chitaldroog District, Mysore, lying between 14\u00b0 24' and 14\u00b0 42' N. and 76\u00b0 7' and 76\u00b0 32' E., with an area of 372 square miles. The population in 1901 was 47,196, compared with 38,229 in 1891. The taluk contains one town, Jagal\u016br (population, 3,307), the head-quarters; and 168 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 60,000. The country is slightly undulating, except where a low and rugged range of hills, covered with thorn jungle, runs from the middle to the north-west. The Chikn\u0101yakanhalli auriferous band crosses the taluk on both sides of this range. The Janagahalla river flows along the east, and a stream from the Anaji tank along the west. The soil in the south is superior to that in the north. Black soil predominates near Jagal\u016br and Bilchod. Cotton and white jola are grown only on the black soil. Rice and sugar-cane are much cultivated.\n\n**Jagann\u0101th.**\u2014Temple in Puri town, Puri District, Bengal. See Puri Town, which is also called Jagann\u0101th.\n\n**Jagann\u0101thganj.**\u2014Village in the Tangail subdivision of Mymensingh District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 24\u00b0 41' N. and 89\u00b0 46' E., on the Brahmaputra. Population (1901), 609. It is the terminus of the Dacca-Mymensingh branch of the Eastern Bengal State Railway, and an important point of call for steamers.\n\n**Jagdispur (1).**\u2014Town in the head-quarters subdivision of Sh\u0101hab\u0101d District, Bengal, situated in 25\u00b0 28' N. and 84\u00b0 26' E. Population (1901), 11,451. The town is a centre of the sugar industry. It was constituted a municipality in 1869. The income during the decade ending 1901\u20132 averaged Rs. 4,600, and the expenditure Rs. 4,400. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 6,600, mainly from a tax on persons (or property tax); and the expenditure was Rs. 7,000.\n\n**Jagdispur (2).**\u2014Head-quarters of Jashpur State, Central Provinces. See Jashpurnagar.\n\n**Jaggayyapeta.**\u2014Town in the Nandig\u0101ma taluk of Kistna District,\nMadras, situated in $16^\\circ 54'$ N. and $80^\\circ 7'$ E. Population (1901), 8,432. It is a depot for much of the commerce which passes between the Northern Circars and the Nizam's Dominions, and possesses a small silk-weaving industry. The place was formerly called Betavolu; but a local chief, who enclosed it with a wall and invited merchants to settle there, named it, after his father, Jaggayyapeta. Near by was discovered in the last quarter of the nineteenth century a Buddhist stupa, 66 feet in diameter and surrounded with marble sculptures.\n\nJagraon Tahsil.\u2014Tahsil of Ludhiana District, Punjab, lying on the south bank of the Sutlej, between $30^\\circ 35'$ and $30^\\circ 59'$ N. and $75^\\circ 22'$ and $75^\\circ 47'$ E., with an area of 418 square miles. It is bounded on the east and south by Patiala and Maler Kotla States. The population in 1901 was 184,765, compared with 166,252 in 1891. It contains the two towns of Jagraon (population, 18,760), the headquarters, and Raikot (10,131); and 169 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to 3.3 lakhs. It is divided into the Bet or Sutlej lowlands, and the Dhaia or upland plain, irrigated by the Abohar branch of the Sirhind Canal. The battle-field of Aliwai is in this tahsil.\n\nJagraon Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Ludhiana District, Punjab, situated in $30^\\circ 47'$ N. and $75^\\circ 28'$ E., 26 miles from Ludhiana town. Population (1901), 18,760. There is a considerable trade in wheat and sugar, and a local industry in ivory-carving, billiard-balls being turned. The municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 18,200, and the expenditure Rs. 15,600. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 19,500, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 25,000. The town has a Government dispensary, and the municipality maintains an Anglo-veracular middle school.\n\nJagtiyal Taluk.\u2014Taluk of Karimnagar District, Hyderabad State, with an area of 971 square miles. The population in 1901, including jagirs, was 203,889, compared with 208,040 in 1891, the decrease being due to famine and cholera. The taluk contains two towns, Jagtiyal (population, 11,181), the head-quarters, and Koratla (5,524); and 251 villages, of which 54 are jagir. The land revenue in 1901 was 3.9 lakhs. Rice is extensively raised by means of tank-irrigation. The taluk is crossed by a low range of hills in the south.\n\nJagtiyal Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluk of the same name in Karimnagar District, Hyderabad State, situated in $18^\\circ 48'$ N. and $78^\\circ 55'$ E. Population (1901), 11,181. To the north of the town is a celebrated old fort, constructed in 1747 by Zafar-ud-daula. The town contains a dispensary and a State school, besides being the head-quarters of a Second Talukdar. Silk saris and scarfs are made here by the Salas.\nJah\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d Subdivision.\u2014Northern subdivision of Gay\u0101 District, Bengal, lying between 24\u00b0 59' and 25\u00b0 19' N. and 84\u00b0 27' and 85\u00b0 13' E., with an area of 606 square miles. The population in 1901 was 386,535, compared with 393,817 in 1891; and with 638 persons to the square mile, it is more densely populated than the rest of the District. The country is alluvial, well cultivated, and intersected by several rivers; and the surface is generally level. It contains one town, Jah\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d (population, 7,018), its head-quarters; and 1,078 villages. It possesses several remains of archaeological interest, which are referred to in the article on Gay\u0101 District.\n\nJah\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d Town (1).\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Gay\u0101 District, Bengal, situated in 25\u00b0 13' N. and 85\u00b0 0' E., at the confluence of the Morhar (or Dardh\u0101) and Jamun\u0101 rivers, on the Patna-Gay\u0101 road and on the Patna-Gay\u0101 branch of the East Indian Railway. Population (1901), 7,018. It was once famous for its weaving industry, and in 1760 it formed one of the eight minor branches connected with the central factory of the East India Company at Patna. In the early years of the nineteenth century the town contained about 700 houses, a cloth factory, and a native agency for the manufacture of saltpetre. The manufacture of cotton cloth has now been displaced by Manchester goods, but large numbers of the Jolah\u0101 or Muhammadan weaver class still live in the neighbourhood. The trade consists chiefly of food-grains, oilseeds, piece-goods, and fancy articles of European manufacture. The town contains the usual public offices; the sub-jail has accommodation for 70 prisoners.\n\nJah\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d Town (2).\u2014Town in the Khajuh\u0101 tahsil of Fatehpur District, United Provinces. See Kor\u0101.\n\nJah\u0101ng\u012bra.\u2014Island in the Ganges, situated in the head-quarters subdivision of Bh\u0101galpur District, Bengal, in 25\u00b0 15' N. and 86\u00b0 44' E. It contains a lingam, a temple, and several interesting rock sculptures.\n\n[Archaeological Survey Reports, vol. xv, pp. 20-4.]\n\nJah\u0101ng\u012br\u0101b\u0101d.\u2014Town in the An\u016bpshahr tahsil of Bulandshahr District, United Provinces, situated in 28\u00b0 24' N. and 78\u00b0 6' E., 15 miles by metalled road from Bulandshahr town. Population (1901), 11,572. The town was built by An\u016bp Rai, founder of An\u016bpshahr, who named it after the emperor Jah\u0101ng\u012br. The place stands low, and was formerly very unhealthy, owing to the stagnant water in the neighbourhood and a ditch round the town; but this has now been drained. Act XX of 1856 is in force, and the income is about Rs. 3,300. There is an important market, which is the centre of a flourishing grain trade. The principal manufacture is calico-printing, excellent counterpanes, curtains, and cloths being turned out. The middle school is attended by over 250 pupils, 40 of whom reside in a boarding-house; and there is a small aided primary school with 38 pupils.\nJah\u0101zgarh.\u2014Village in the Jhajjar tahsil of Rohtak District, Punjab. See GEORGEGARH.\n\nJah\u0101zpur.\u2014Head-quarters of a zila or district of the same name, in the north-east corner of the State of Udaipur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in $25^\\circ 37'$ N. and $75^\\circ 17'$ E., about 12 miles south-west of the cantonment of Deoli. Population (1901), 3,399. On an isolated hill overlooking the town, and guarding the eastern entrance of an important pass, stands a large and strong fort consisting of two ramparts, one within the other, each having a deep ditch and numerous bastions. Jah\u0101zpur contains a primary school attended by 70 boys, and a hospital with accommodation for 10 in-patients. The town is said to have been taken by Akbar from the R\u0101n\u0101 about 1567, and seven years later was given in j\u0101g\u012br to Jagm\u0101l, who had gone over to the imperial court in consequence of some disagreement with his elder brother, R\u0101n\u0101 Prat\u0101p Singh. In the eighteenth century it was held for short periods by the R\u0101j\u0101 of Sh\u0101hpura, and in 1806 was taken possession of by Z\u0101lim Singh, the famous Diw\u0101n of Kotah, who, at the intervention of the British Government, gave it up in 1819, when it was restored to Udaipur. The district now consists of the town and 306 villages, largely inhabited by Min\u0101s.\n\nJaigarh.\u2014Seaport in the District and taluka of Ratn\u0101giri, Bombay, situated in $17^\\circ 17'$ N. and $73^\\circ 13'$ E., at the southern entrance to the Sh\u0101stri or Sangameshw\u0101r river, 99 miles south of Bombay. Population (1901), 2,567. The harbour forms a bay 2 miles long and 5 miles broad, with deep water, and well protected against winds. The exports, which amounted to 4.9 lakhs in 1903\u20134, are chiefly firewood and molasses; the imports, which in the same year amounted to 6.6 lakhs, are principally rice and salt. Jaigarh is now little more than a fishing village. The fort, which occupies an area of 4 acres, is situated close to the shore on gently rising ground about 200 feet above the sea. The walls and bastions are, except in a few places, still in good repair, but are gradually decaying. The fort was originally built by the Bij\u0101pur kings, and was afterwards the retreat of a noted Hindu pirate, the Naik of Sangameshw\u0101r, who was sufficiently powerful to resist two combined expeditions of the Portuguese and Bij\u0101pur forces sent against him in 1583 and 1585. In 1713 Jaigarh passed into the hands of the famous Mar\u0101th\u0101 sea-robbert Angri\u0101; and in June, 1818, on the downfall of the Peshw\u0101, was surrendered to the British. A lighthouse, visible for 13 miles, stands on the headland. The town contains one school.\n\nJaijon.\u2014Ancient town in the Garhshankar tahsil of Hoshiarpur District, Punjab, situated in $31^\\circ 21'$ N. and $76^\\circ 13'$ E., on the outer edge of the Siw\u0101likis, 10 miles north of Garhshankar town. Population (1901), 2,705. Though now of small importance, it was in early\ndays the seat of the Jasw\u0101l R\u0101j\u0101s. R\u0101j\u0101 R\u0101m Singh first took up his residence here; and the fort which commanded the pass in the hills is said to have been constructed in 1701, and to have been taken by Ranjit Singh in 1815. It was dismantled by the British Government at annexation. The ruins of the palaces of the Jasw\u0101l R\u0101j\u0101s are still visible above the town. The place was till lately an emporium of trade, second only to Hoshiarpur; and even now a good deal of cloth, both country and English, passes through towards the hills, while hill produce, such as rice, turmeric, &c., passes down to the plains.\n\nJainagar.\u2014Town in the District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal. See Jaynagar.\n\nJainti\u0101 Parganas.\u2014A tract of country in the north-east corner of Sylhet District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between $24^\\circ 52'$ and $25^\\circ 11'$ N. and $91^\\circ 45'$ and $92^\\circ 25'$ E., and between the Jainti\u0101 Hills and the Surm\u0101 river. Area, 484 square miles; population (1901), 121,157. The parganas consist of a series of low depressions or basins drained by the streams flowing into the Surm\u0101. The banks of the rivers are the highest part of the country, and are generally lined with villages, but in the centre of the basins water often remains throughout the year. Much of the land at the foot of the hills and at the western end of the tract lies too low for cultivation and is covered with high jungle, and here and there the level of the plain is broken by low isolated hills. The parganas originally formed part of the territory of a native prince whose dominions extended over the Jainti\u0101 Hills to the Kalang river in the plains of Assam. The Jainti\u0101 R\u0101j\u0101s were of Synteng or Kh\u0101si origin, and, although they had long come under the influence of Hinduism, the custom of descent through the female line was still maintained. Tradition has preserved the names of twenty-two kings, and is, to some extent, confirmed by coins and native records, which refer to the conquest of the State by the Koch king Nar N\u0101r\u0101yan about 1565. The Jainti\u0101 R\u0101j\u0101 was defeated and captured by the Ahom generals at the beginning of the eighteenth century; but the hillmen declined to submit to the conqueror's yoke, and the State continued for all practical purposes to be independent. When C\u0101ch\u0101r was invaded by the Burmans in 1824, the Jainti\u0101 R\u0101j\u0101 entered into an alliance with the British, but his conduct in this, as in other matters, was not entirely above suspicion. In 1832 he kidnapped four British subjects from Sylhet, and sacrificed three of them at Ph\u0101ljor before the shrine of the goddess K\u0101li. Similar attempts had been made on three previous occasions, and the British Government demanded the surrender of the guilty parties. No satisfaction could be obtained by diplomacy; and in 1835 the Government, as a mark of their displeasure, annexed that portion of the kingdom which lay in the Sylhet plains. The R\u0101j\u0101 then declined to\nretain any portion of his diminished dominions, and the Jainti\u0101 Hills lapsed to the British Government. After annexation the parganas were settled in 1836 for Rs. 36,000, and this settlement remained substantially in force for the next twenty years. In 1856 they were resettled for a further term of twenty years, the revenue demand at the commencement of the settlement being Rs. 54,000, rising to Rs. 62,000 in 1876, owing to the inclusion of land taken up during its currency. At the next settlement the revenue was raised to Rs. 1,68,000; but as it was found that the people could not bear such a sudden enhancement, the demand was reduced to Rs. 1,24,000. In 1898 the parganas were again resettled for a term of fifteen years, the demand being fixed at Rs. 1,87,000 on an area of 197,000 acres, of which 72,000 acres were uncultivated. The rates assessed on homestead and cultivated land vary from Rs. 2\u201310 to 12 annas an acre. Four-fifths of the cultivated area is under rice, most of which is of the long-stemmed variety sown in marshy tracts. In the cold season mustard and linseed are grown, chiefly on land which lies too low for rice. The rainfall is abundant, but is sometimes unfavourably distributed, and much damage is occasionally done by the floods of the hill streams. On the other hand, the soil is fertile, and the villagers can obtain a ready market for the surplus products of their rice-fields and of the excellent fruit gardens that surround their houses. The people are, however, unenterprising and backward, village industries are almost unknown, and the ryots are in consequence compelled to buy nearly everything that they require. A considerable portion of the parganas lies too low for cultivation and is covered with dense jungle, and the climate at the foot of the hills is malarious and unhealthy.\n\nJaintiapur.\u2014Village in the North Sylhet subdivision of Sylhet District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 25\u00b0 8' N. and 92\u00b0 8' E. It was formerly the capital of the Jainti\u0101 R\u0101j\u0101, whose territory was annexed in 1835 in consequence of his complicity in the murder of three British subjects offered up to the goddess K\u0101li. There were formerly some interesting remains, marking the transition from the primitive paganism of the hill tribes to the elaborate Hinduism imported from Bengal, the former symbolized by great monoliths of unhewn stone, the latter by Hindu temples with their carvings and images. These ruins were, however, thrown down by the earthquake of 1897, and Jaintiapur is no longer a place of much importance. A market largely attended by the hill tribes is, however, held here once a week.\n\nJaipur Residency.\u2014One of the eight Political Charges into which R\u0101jput\u0101na is divided. It is made up of the States of Jaipur and Kishangarh and the small chiefship of L\u0101wa, lying in the eastern half of the Agency, between 25\u00b0 41' and 28\u00b0 34' N. and 74\u00b0 40' and 77\u00b0 13' E. It is bounded on the north by Bikaner and the Punjab; on the west\nby Jodhpur and the British District of Ajmer; on the south by the Shahpura chiefship, and the States of Udaipur, Bundi, Tonk, Kotah, and Gwalior; and on the east by Karauli, Bharatpur, and Alwar. The head-quarters of the Resident are at Jaipur. The population has varied: (1881) 2,642,457, (1891) 2,952,842, and (1901) 2,752,397. The decrease of nearly 7 per cent. during the last decade was due to the famine of 1899\u20131900, and to a severe outbreak of malarial fever in the autumn of 1900. The total area is 16,456 square miles, and the density of population 167 persons per square mile, as compared with 76 for the Agency as a whole. Although fourth in size among the political divisions of Rajputana, the Residency ranks first as regards population. In 1901 Hindus formed nearly 91 per cent. of the total, and Musalmans 7 per cent. There were also 956 Christians (including 394 natives).\n\nThe following table gives details for the States and chiefship forming the Residency:\n\n| State          | Area in square miles | Population, 1901 | Normal land revenue (khalsa), in thousands of rupees |\n|----------------|----------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Jaipur         | 15,579               | 2,658,666        | 42,00                                               |\n| Kishangarh     | 858                  | 90,970           | 1,50                                                |\n| L\u0101wa (chiefship)| 19                   | 2,671            | 10                                                  |\n| Total          | 16,456               | 2,752,397        | 43,60                                               |\n\nThere are altogether 5,959 villages and 41 towns. The largest towns are Jaipur City (160,167), S\u012bkar (21,523), Fatehpur (16,393), Kishangarh (12,663), Nawalgadh (12,315), Jhunjhunu (12,279), Hindaun (11,938), and R\u0101mgadh (11,023).\n\nJaipur State.\u2014State in the north-east and east of Rajputana, lying between 25\u00b0 41\u2032 and 28\u00b0 34\u2032 N. and 74\u00b0 41\u2032 and 77\u00b0 13\u2032 E. Its area is 15,579 square miles, and it is consequently the fourth largest of the Rajputana States. It is bounded on the north by Bikaner, Loh\u0101ru, and Pati\u0101la, while its detached district of Kot Kasim adjoins the Rew\u0101ri tahsil of Gurgaon District and the State of N\u0101bha; on the west by Bikaner, Jodhpur, Kishangarh, and the British District of Ajmer; on the south by Udaipur, Bundi, Tonk, Kotah, and Gwalior; and on the east by Karauli, Bharatpur, and Alwar. The country is for the most part fairly level and open, although its surface is crossed and diversified by groups and ranges of hills, and by isolated peaks. The centre of the State is an elevated table-land of triangular form, from 1,400 to 1,600 feet above sea-level. The base of this triangle is a line running west from Jaipur city; the eastern side consists of ranges of hills running north and south along the Alwar border; while the apex is\nformed by a broken chain of hills, a portion of the Aravalli range, which runs from near the Sambhar Lake in a north-easterly direction as far as Khetri. These hills attain a considerable height, the loftiest peak being Raghunathgarh (3,450 feet above the sea), and form a natural boundary between the sandy desert tract of Shekhawati to the north and the fertile plains of Jaipur proper to the south and south-east. Westward from the capital, the country rises gradually towards the Kishangarh border, consisting in great measure of broad, open, treeless plains, dotted here and there with hills. In the extreme south the hills reappear; and in the neighbourhood of Rajmahal, where the Banas river has forced its way through the range, the scenery is remarkable for its beauty. The south-eastern portion of the State has many ranges of low hills, and near the Karauli border is much intersected by ravines, while to the east of the capital there is a rapid fall of from 300 to 400 feet within the first two or three miles, after which a gradual slope follows the valley of the Banganga river to the Bharatpur border.\n\nThe Banas, the principal river of Jaipur, flows for about 110 miles through, or along the borders of, the State. It has numerous tributaries, such as the Dain, the Mashi, the Dhil, the Galwa, and the Morel. The Chambal merely forms the south-eastern boundary of the State, separating it from Kotah and Gwalior territory. The Banganga is for about 90 miles a river of Jaipur, flowing first in a south-easterly direction and then almost due east. Among other rivers are the Bandi, a tributary of the Mashi; the Dhund and Khari, tributaries of the Morel; the Amarni-Shah, which supplies Jaipur city with drinking-water, and joins the Dhund; the Mendha, which flows into the Sambhar Lake; the Sabi or Sahibi, which flows north-east into Alwar, and thence through Kot Kasim, into Gurgaon; and lastly the Kantli or Katli, which, after a northerly course of some 60 miles through Shekhawati, loses itself in the sand just within the Bikaner border. Almost all the minor rivers are dry during the hot months. The only natural lake of any importance is the salt lake at Sambhar, the eastern portion of which is the joint property of the Jaipur and Jodhpur Darbars.\n\nA considerable part of the State is covered with alluvium, but in the northern and eastern districts large areas are occupied by schists belonging to the Aravalli system, resting on gneiss and overlaid by quartzites of the Delhi system. Intrusive granite is common in the Torawati hills in the north-east. Copper is found at Khetri and Singhana at the northern end of the Aravalli range; at the former place the ore occurs in schists, and at the latter in the Alwar quartzites. Nickel and cobalt are found at Babai (7 miles south of Khetri) in association with copper pyrites disseminated through the slates, the ore being known as sehta. At Karwar near Hindaun iron occurs in the\njaspidous shales of the Gwalior series, while near R\u0101jmahal in the south-west garnets are collected from the Ar\u0101valli schists.\n\nThe country contains the usual small game, including imperial sandgrouse in parts of Shekh\u0101wati; there are fine herds of antelope near the capital, and a fair number of wild hog. In the two large game preserves, the one north-east of Jaipur city and the other near Sawai M\u0101dhopur in the south-east, tigers, leopards, hyenas, and s\u0101mbar (Cervus unicolor) are found; and the preserve last mentioned also contains black bears.\n\nThe climate is dry and healthy, and malarious fevers, though very prevalent in 1900 and 1901, are of rare occurrence. During the hot season the winds from the west blow with great force in Shekh\u0101wati and the northern portions of Jaipur, but the sand soon parts with its heat, and the nights are generally pleasant and the mornings cool. The mean temperature at Jaipur city, taken from a record of thirty-five years, is $77^\\circ$, varying from $59^\\circ$ in January to $91^\\circ$ in June. In 1904 the maximum temperature was $114^\\circ$ in May, and the minimum $37^\\circ$ in January.\n\nThe annual rainfall for the whole State averages a little less than 23 inches, of which 20 inches are received in July, August, and September. The rainfall varies from 15 to 18 inches in the north, 21 in the west, and about 25 at the capital, to more than 31 inches in the south-east. The maximum fall in any one year was 55 inches at the capital in 1892, and the minimum 4 inches at Jh\u016bnjhunu in the north in 1901.\n\nThe Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Jaipur is the head of the Kachw\u0101ha clan of R\u0101jputs, which claims descent from Kusa, the son of R\u0101ma, king of Ajodhy\u0101, and the hero of the famous epic poem the R\u0101m\u0101yana. The early history of the family is obscure; but they are said to have settled at Roht\u0101s on the Son river, whence, towards the end of the third century, they migrated to Gwalior and Narwar. Here the Kachw\u0101has ruled for about 800 years, but they were not always independent, nor was their rule unbroken. The first Kachw\u0101ha chief of Gwalior of whom there is any record was Vajrad\u0101man, who, according to an inscription at Gwalior dated A.D. 977, took the town about that time from the rulers of Kanauj, and became independent. The eighth in descent from Vajrad\u0101man was Tej Karan, otherwise known as Dulha Rai ('the bridegroom prince'), who left Gwalior about 1128. There are different stories as to the cause of his departure. Some say that he was expelled by his uncle, and others that he left in order to marry Maroni, the daughter of the Barg\u016bjar R\u0101jput chief of Daosa, leaving Gwalior in charge of his sister's son, who was either a Parih\u0101r or a Param\u0101ra R\u0101jput, and who repaid the confidence thus placed in him by usurping that principality. Both accounts, however, agree that Dulha Rai received\nfrom his father-in-law (who had no sons) the district of Daosa; and the Kachw\u0101ha dynasty in Eastern R\u0101jput\u0101na may be said to date from about 1128, with the town of Daosa as its first capital. The country was at this time called Dh\u016bndh\u0101r, a name variously derived from a once celebrated sacrificial mound (dh\u016bndh) on the western frontier near Kalakh and Jobner, or from a demon-king called Dh\u016bndh\u016b, whose cave is still pointed out on the hill at Galta, a little to the east of Jaipur city, or from the river Dh\u016bnd; and it was parcelled out among petty R\u0101jput and M\u012bn\u0101 chiefs, all owing allegiance to the R\u0101jput kings of Delhi. About 1150 one of Dulha Rai\u2019s successors wrested Amber from the Sus\u0101wat Min\u0101s and made it his capital. It remained such for nearly six centuries, and gave its name to the State. Paj\u016bn, fourth (or, as some say, fifth) in descent from Dulha Rai, is said to have married the sister of Prithwi R\u0101j Chauh\u0101n, the last Hindu king of Delhi, and was killed with the latter in 1192 in a battle with Muhammad Ghori. Towards the end of the fourteenth century Udai Karan was chief of Amber, and about this time the district now called Shekh\u0101wat\u012b came into the possession of the Kachw\u0101has.\n\nOn the irruption of the Mughals into Hindust\u0101n, the Amber State at once succumbed to their supremacy. Bah\u0101r Mal, who was chief from about 1548 to 1574, was the first to pay homage to the Muhammadan power. He received from Hum\u0101y\u016bn the command of 5,000, and gave his daughter in marriage to Akbar. Bah\u0101r Mal\u2019s son, Bhagw\u0101n D\u0101s, was the friend of Akbar, whose life he is said to have saved at the battle of Sarn\u0101l. He was also a commander of 5,000 horse, and subsequently governor of the Punjab; in 1585 or 1586 he gave his daughter in marriage to Salim, who afterwards mounted the throne of Delhi as Jah\u0101ng\u012br. M\u0101n Singh, the adopted son of Bhagw\u0101n D\u0101s, succeeded about 1590, and died about 1614. He was one of the most conspicuous of the imperial generals and, though a Hindu, was raised to a higher rank (commander of 7,000) than any other officer in the realm. He fought in Orissa, Bengal, and Assam, and at different periods was governor of K\u0101bul, Bengal, Bih\u0101r, and the Deccan. The next chief of note was Jai Singh I, commonly known by his imperial title of Mirza R\u0101j\u0101. His name appears in all the wars of Aurangzeb in the Deccan. He was the commander of 6,000 horse, and he captured Sivaji, the celebrated founder of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 power. Eventually, it is said, Aurangzeb, becoming jealous of Jai Singh, caused his death by poison in 1667 or 1668. Passing over two chiefs, we come to Jai Singh II, commonly known as Sawai Jai Singh. Sawai was a title given by the Mughal emperor, and is borne by his descendants to this day. The word means \u2018one and a quarter,\u2019 and is supposed to measure the superiority of the bearer to all his contemporaries, whom the unit signifies. He succeeded\nto the gaddi of Amber in 1699, and died in 1743. He was chiefly remarkable for his scientific knowledge and skill. He caused many mathematical works to be translated into Sanskrit; and he erected observatories at Jaipur, Delhi, Benares, Muttra, and Ujjain, by which he was able to correct the astronomical tables of De La Hire and to leave, as a monument of his skill, lists of stars collated by himself known as the Zij Muhammad Sh\u0101hi, or astronomical tables of Muhammad Sh\u0101h, then king of Delhi, in whose favour he stood high. Removing his capital from Amber, he laid out and built the present city of Jaipur in 1728. Jai Singh was one of the most remarkable men of his age and nation. Amid revolution, the destruction of the empire, and the meteoric rise of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, he not only steered through the dangers, but elevated his State above all the principalities around. He made, however, one great mistake. The Jaipur and Jodhpur chiefs had renewed with Udaipur the treaty for common defence against the Muhammadan power; but to obtain the privilege of remarrying with the Udaipur family, which they had forfeited by giving daughters to the emperors, they agreed that the son of an Udaipur princess should succeed in preference to an elder son by other wives.\n\nThis attempt to set aside the rights of primogeniture brought great disasters on both Jaipur and Jodhpur. Soon after Jai Singh's death, the J\u0101ts of Bharatpur, after several successful encounters with the Jaipur chief, annexed a portion of the State, and the defection of the chief of M\u0101cheri (now Alwar), about 1790, further reduced the limits of the territory. By the end of the century Jaipur had fallen into great confusion, being distracted by internal broils and impoverished by the exactions of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s. In 1803, in the time of Jagat Singh, the most dissolute prince of his race or age, a treaty was concluded with Jaipur by the British Government, the object being to form a league against the Mar\u0101th\u0101s; but the alliance was dissolved in 1805, on the ground that the State had violated its engagements by not cooperating against Holkar. Subsequently the disputes between Jaipur and Jodhpur for the hand of the daughter of the Udaipur chief brought both States to the verge of ruin, while Am\u012br Kh\u0101n, with his Pind\u0101ri mercenaries, was exhausting the country. In 1817 negotiations began again; and in 1818 a treaty was signed, by which the protection of the British Government was extended to Jaipur and an annual tribute fixed. Jagat Singh died in December, 1818, and was succeeded by a posthumous son, Jai Singh III, during whose minority the State was a scene of corruption and misgovernment. A rebellion in the city in the latter part of 1820 led to the deputation for the first time of a British officer to reside at the capital. In 1835, on the succession of Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 R\u0101m Singh, a serious disturbance in the city took place,\nin which Colonel Alves, the Governor-General's Agent in R\u0101jput\u0101na, was wounded, and his Assistant, Mr. Martin Blake, killed. After this, the British Government took measures to maintain order. A Council of Regency, consisting of five of the principal nobles, was formed under the superintendence of the Political Agent, to whose decision all measures of importance were submitted. The army was reduced and every branch of the administration reformed. The tribute, fixed by the treaty of 1818 at 8 lakhs, was subsequently considered excessive; and in 1842 a remission was made of over 46 lakhs of arrears, and the annual tribute was reduced to 4 lakhs. Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 R\u0101m Singh received full powers in 1851; during the Mutiny he placed the whole of his available military power at the disposal of the Political Agent, and in every way assisted the British Government, and he was rewarded with the grant of the pargana of Kot K\u0101sim. In 1862 he obtained the privilege of adoption, and in 1863 was created a G.C.S.I. For his praiseworthy behaviour and liberality during the famine which visited R\u0101jput\u0101na in 1868 he received an addition of two guns to his salute for life; at the Imperial assemblage at Delhi in January, 1877, his personal salute was raised to 21 guns, and he became a Counsellor of the Empress; and in 1878 he was made a C.I.E. He died in 1880 without male issue.\n\nMah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 R\u0101m Singh was an intelligent ruler, and took great interest in opening up roads through his State and also in education. Moreover, he much extended irrigation, and gave his capital the benefits of gas and water-works. On his death-bed he nominated as his successor Kaim Singh, the younger brother of the Th\u0101kur of Isarda and a descendant of the second son of Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Jagat Singh. The Government confirming the selection, Kaim Singh succeeded in 1880 under the name of Sawai M\u0101dho Singh II, and is the present ruler. He was born in 1862, and, in consideration of his youth, the administration was at first conducted by a Council under the joint presidency of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 and the Political Agent. He was invested with full powers in 1882, and has worthily followed in the footsteps of his adoptive father. In 1887 his salute was raised from 17 to 19 guns as a personal distinction, followed in 1896 by two additional guns. In 1888 he was created a G.C.S.I.; in 1901 a G.C.I.E.; and in 1903 a G.C.V.O. In 1904 he was made honorary colonel of the 13th R\u0101jputs (the Shekh\u0101wati Regiment). Among important events of His Highness's rule may be mentioned the raising of the Imperial Service transport corps in 1889\u201390; the construction of numerous irrigation works, hospitals, and dispensaries; the gift of 20 lakhs as an endowment to the Indian People's Famine Relief Trust; and his visit to England in 1902 in connexion with the coronation of King Edward VII. Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 M\u0101dho Singh has no\nnear relations on the male side. In the event of failure of direct heirs, the right of succession is vested in the R\u0101j\u0101w\u0101t family, or the descendants of the eldest son of Prithvi R\u0101j, who was chief of Amber in the sixteenth century.\n\nAmong places of archaeological and historical interest may be mentioned Amber, Bair\u0101t, Chatsu, Daosa, and the fort of Ranthambhor. At Amb\u0101heri in the Baswa tahsil are some interesting old palaces, and at Toda Rai Singh in the south-west is another old palace ascribed to a Sesodia R\u0101j\u0101, Rai Singh (in the seventeenth century).\n\nThe number of towns and villages in the State is 5,773, and the population at each of the three enumerations was: (1881) 2,527,142, (1891) 2,823,966, and (1901) 2,658,666. The territory is divided into ten niz\u0101ms or districts, and contains one city, the capital of the State, and 37 towns. The chief towns are S\u012bkar, Fatehpur, Nawalgarh, Jhunjhunu, R\u0101mgarh, and Lachmangarh, all in Shekhawati in the north, Hindaun in the east, and Sawai M\u0101dhopur in the south-east. The following table gives the principal statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Niz\u0101mat       | Towns | Villages | Population | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|---------------|-------|----------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Sawai Jaipur  | 6     | 1,535    | 694,284    | - 3.6                                           | 23,563                                 |\n| Daosa         | 3     | 792      | 332,437    | + 0.05                                          | 5,520                                  |\n| Gangapur      | 2     | 154      | 74,175     | - 8.6                                           | 1,315                                  |\n| Hindaun       | 2     | 411      | 185,113    | - 0.7                                           | 3,138                                  |\n| Kot K\u0101sim     |       | 53       | 20,827     | + 22.1                                          | 364                                    |\n| Sawai M\u0101dhopur| 2     | 621      | 216,321    | - 10.9                                          | 4,194                                  |\n| M\u0101lpura       | 3     | 381      | 134,328    | - 32.0                                          | 3,836                                  |\n| Sambhar       | 3     | 305      | 171,618    | - 6.89                                          | 5,882                                  |\n| Shekhawati    | 12    | 953      | 471,961    | - 3.3                                           | 11,816                                 |\n| Tor\u0101wati      | 5     | 530      | 357,602    | + 4.4                                           | 7,536                                  |\n| State total   | 38    | 5,735    | 2,658,666  | - 5.85                                          | 67,166                                 |\n\nThe decrease in population during the last decade was due to the famine of 1899\u20131900, which was most severely felt in M\u0101lpura, and to the severe outbreak of malarial fever and cholera that followed it. Kot K\u0101sim suffered least from this famine, and the increase in its population is ascribed to immigration from the neighbouring tracts. Jaipur has a larger population than any other State in R\u0101jput\u0101na, while as regards density it stands fourth, with 171 persons per square mile. Of the total, 2,418,401, or more than 90 per cent., are Hindus, the prevailing sects being Vaishnava. Of Hindu sects with a peculiar doctrine and worship, the most notable is that of the D\u0101d\u016bpanthis,\nwho in 1901 numbered 8,610, and have their head-quarters at Naraina near the Sambhar Lake. Muhammadans number 193,044, or over 7 per cent., while 44,630 are Jains. The languages mainly spoken are Jaipur\u012b or Dhund\u0101ri, one of the four main groups of Rajasthani: B\u0101gri, a form of M\u0101rw\u0101ri; and D\u0101ngi, a form of Western Hindi.\n\nOf castes and tribes, the Brahmins come first, numbering 349,000, or over 13 per cent. of the total; they are mostly cultivators. Next are the Jats (265,000, or nearly 10 per cent.), well-known as patient and laborious agriculturists. The Min\u0101s number 241,000; they held a good deal of this part of the country in the twelfth century, and for some time after they were dispossessed by the Kachw\u0101ha R\u0101jputs it was customary for one of their number to mark the tika on the torehead of a new chief of Amber. They are now divided into two main classes: namely, the zamind\u0101ri or agriculturists, and the chaukid\u0101ri or watchmen; the former are industrious and well behaved, while the latter were, and to some extent still are, famous as marauders. As noticed later on, it is not always easy to distinguish one class from the other. The Cham\u0101rs (workers in leather and agriculturists) number 218,000; Mah\u0101jans (bankers and traders), 212,000; G\u016bjars (cattle-breeders and agriculturists), 184,000; R\u0101jputs, 124,000 (of whom 63,300 belong to the Kachw\u0101ha clan, 15,000 to the R\u0101thor, 13,300 to the Chauh\u0101n, and 12,800 to the Tonwar, while 3,532 were returned in 1901 as Muhammadans); M\u0101lis (gardeners and agriculturists), 116,000. More than 53 per cent. of the people live by the land, and over 19 per cent. are masons, builders, cotton-weavers, tailors, workers in gold, silver, and precious metals, shoemakers, and the like.\n\nOut of 364 native Christians returned in 1901, 208 were Methodists, 50 Anglicans, 46 Roman Catholics, and 38 Presbyterians. The comparatively large number of Methodists, found almost entirely in the Sambhar niz\u0101mat, is due to the presence of the American Methodist Mission at Ajmer. The United Free Church of Scotland Mission has had a branch at Jaipur since 1866.\n\nAgricultural conditions vary in different parts of the State. Shekh\u0101wati consists almost entirely of shifting sands, and generally produces only one harvest in the year, raised during the rainy season and ripening in October and November. This consists chiefly of bajra, m\u016bng, and moth. Camels are usually yoked to the plough instead of bullocks. The soil in the immediate neighbourhood of the capital and to the west and north is generally sandy; the rains crop is the same as in Shekh\u0101wati, and a little wheat and barley are grown in the cold season. To the east of the capital, along the Bangang\u0101 valley and in the southern districts, the soil is for the most part either black cotton or a rich alluvial loam. Here jow\u0101r, maize, cotton, and til are grown in the rains, while the cold-season\ncrops are wheat, barley, gram, sugar-cane, and poppy. In the Gangapur district in the east, rice of a coarse quality is cultivated to a small extent.\n\nAgricultural statistics are available only for the kh\u0101lsa portion of the State, excluding Shekh\u0101wati. The area for which particulars are on record is 3,548 square miles, or rather more than one-fifth of the total: deducting 961 square miles, which either comprise forests or are otherwise not available for cultivation, there remain 2,587 square miles, of which, in 1903\u20134, about 1,304 square miles, or over 50 per cent., were actually cultivated. The area cropped more than once was 57 square miles, and consequently the net area cropped was 1,247 square miles. These statistics, which are available only from 1895\u20136, show that in that year 1,310 square miles were cultivated; the area under cultivation in the disastrous famine year of 1899\u20131900 fell to 765 square miles, and since then there has been a steady increase to the present figure.\n\nThe staple food-grains of the people are bajra, barley, and jow\u0101r, the areas under which, in 1903\u20134, were respectively about 271, 207, and 160 square miles, or, collectively, about one-half of the total area cultivated. Next in importance come wheat, the area under which was 114 square miles; cotton, 93 square miles (mostly in M\u0101lpura in the south-west); gram, 66 square miles; til, 53 square miles; and maize, 52 square miles.\n\nThere have been no improvements of recent years either in agricultural methods or in the introduction of new seed, the people being very conservative. Increased facilities for irrigation led to extended cultivation up to 1899\u20131900, when a disastrous famine occurred, but the State is rapidly recovering. Loans are regularly advanced to agriculturists for the purchase of seed and cattle, or for the improvement of wells, a sum of Rs. 50,000 being provided annually for this purpose.\n\nJaipur has no particular breed of cattle or horses. No attempts have been made to improve the indigenous strains, and the best animals are imported. Sheep and goats are reared in considerable numbers, and the camels of Shekh\u0101wati are of a good stamp, being strong and hardy.\n\nOf the total area cultivated (in kh\u0101lsa territory, excluding Shekh\u0101wati) 436 square miles, or 33 per cent., were irrigated in 1903\u20134: namely, 45 square miles from canals, 20 from tanks, 342 from wells, and 29 from other sources. The number of wells has not been recorded, but 200 irrigation works in the State are in charge of the Public Works department. The expenditure on them between 1868 and 1904 has exceeded 66 lakhs, while the revenue realized from them during the same period approaches 50 lakhs. Perhaps the most important of these works is that known as the R\u0101ngarh band, which is described in\nthe article on the B\u0101ngang\u0101 river. Another fine tank is the Tordi S\u0101gar in the south-west, close to the town of Malpura. The Buch\u0101ra band in the Tor\u0101wati hills, 60 miles north of the capital, can hold up water sufficient to irrigate about 17 square miles, and cost, when completed in 1889, 2\u00b78 lakhs. The total expenditure to 1903 was about 3\u00b74 lakhs, and the revenue realized 2\u00b78 lakhs. One of the most remunerative of the larger irrigation works is the Kalakh S\u0101gar, about 30 miles north-west of the capital. It was completed in 1883 at a cost of 2 lakhs, and can, when full, irrigate nearly 8 square miles. It has 55 miles of main canals and 118 miles of distributaries. The total expenditure to 1903 was about 3 lakhs, and the revenue during the same period no less than 6\u00b74 lakhs. Among more recent and smaller works is the Fateh S\u0101gar in the Hindaun district in the east; it has cost (including repairs) less than Rs. 15,000, while the actual revenue it brought in up to 1903 was 1\u00b74 lakhs. During the official year 1902\u20133 the revenue from this tank was Rs. 13,900, or more than 95 per cent. on the capital outlay.\n\nThe forests cover an area of about 283 square miles, and are divided into \u2018reserved\u2019 (71 square miles), demarcated (93 square miles), and undemarcated (119 square miles). The \u2018reserved\u2019 portion is mostly in the Sawai Jaipur and M\u0101dhopur niz\u0101mats. There are but few valuable timber trees. The following are common: bab\u016bl (Acacia arabica), ber (Zizyphus fujuba), dhak (Butea frondosa), dhokra (Anogeissus pendula), g\u016blar (Ficus glomerata), j\u0101mun (Eugenia Jambolana), khair (Acacia Catechu), n\u012bm (Melia Azadirachta), pipal (Ficus religiosa), and, in the south, shisham (Dalbergia Sissoo) and bamboo. Right-holders graze their cattle free of charge, and others on payment. The forest produce, such as firewood, bamboos, grass, fruits, honey, and lac, is sold. The yearly revenue is about Rs. 24,000, and the expenditure Rs. 8,600.\n\nApart from salt, which is largely manufactured at the S\u0101mbhar Lake, the minerals of the State are now hardly worked at all. Iron occurs near Khetri, and at Karwar close to Hindaun, but the mines have long been abandoned. The well-known copper-mines of Khetri and Singh\u0101na have not been worked for many years; but in this neighbourhood, particularly at Babai, cobalt is found in thin layers between the veins of copper ore, and is much used for enamelling. Good building stone, chiefly sandstone and marble, is plentiful. At Bh\u0101nkri, 36 miles east of the capital, and at Toda Rai Singh in the south-west, huge slabs of a foliated mica schist are quarried, and are used for roofing and flagging purposes. Coarse grey marble comes from Rai\u0101la near the Alwar border; and a black marble, used for inlaying work, is obtained at Bhainsl\u0101na near Kot P\u016bthi in the north-east. Abundance of excellent limestone is procured from Rahori, about 14 miles north-east of the capital, and kankar is found almost\neverywhere, generally in flat beds instead of in scattered nodules. Garnets of the best kind are fairly common in the R\u0101jmahal hills near the river Ban\u0101s in the south-west, and turquoises are said to have been found at Toda in the same neighbourhood. From the Hindaun district in the east come talc and the steatite of which the well-known Agra toys are made.\n\nThe chief manufactures are woollen cloths and fabrics, cotton cloths and chintzes, marble sculpture, enamel-work, pottery, and brass and lacquer-work. The woollen goods are turned out at M\u0101lpura. The Sanganer and Bagru chintzes, or dyed and stamped cotton cloths, are perhaps the most characteristic of Jaipur textiles, but their sale has decreased owing to the presence in the bazars of cheap imported imitations. In enamelling on gold Jaipur is acknowledged to be pre-eminent, and some work is also done on silver and copper.\n\nThere are three cotton-presses in the State: two at the capital, started in 1885; and one at Mand\u0101war or Hindaun Road, started in 1893. They are owned and worked by the State, and give employment to about 240 hands. In 1904 about 3,730 tons of cotton and 4 tons of wool were pressed: the expenditure was Rs. 42,000 and the revenue Rs. 62,000.\n\nThe most noticeable feature in the commerce of the State is the large banking and exchange business carried on at the capital, and in the large towns of Shekh\u0101wati. The chief exports are salt, cotton, gh\u012b, oilseeds, printed cloths, woollen fabrics, marble images, brass-ware, and lacquered bracelets; while the main imports are English piece-goods, sugar, rice, tobacco, and hardware. The principal trade route is the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway, which carries nearly the whole of the exports and imports. There is but little traffic northward from the capital, as the trade of Shekh\u0101wati travels principally either north-east to the great mart of Bhiw\u0101ni in Hiss\u0101r, or south-west to Ajmer. The principal export from Shekh\u0101wati is wool, and the imports are grain, sugar, piece-goods, spices, and tobacco; for the carriage of these, camels are used almost exclusively.\n\nThe R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway traverses the State from east to west, with a total length, including the branches from Phalera towards Kuch\u0101wan Road and Rew\u0101ri, and from B\u0101ndikui in the Agra direction, of about 243 miles. The Darb\u0101r is constructing a line from the capital to Sawai M\u0101dhopur in the south-east, a distance of 73 miles; it is estimated to cost 29 lakhs, exclusive of rolling-stock, and the first 32 miles, as far as Nawai, have recently been opened for traffic.\n\nThe total length of metalled roads is about 283 miles, and of unmetalled roads about 236 miles. These are all in charge of the Public Works department, and are maintained by the State; and all\nbut one were constructed entirely at the cost of the State. The exception is the trunk road from Agra to Ajmer, constructed between 1865 and 1869; its length in Jaipur is about 127 miles, and its cost was 6.5 lakhs, of which the British Government subscribed one-fifth. One small piece of road was built and is maintained by the British Government: namely, about 9 miles of the metalled road between Nasirabad and Deoli. Other important roads are those connecting the capital with Tonk city, and Hindaun Road railway station with the town of Karauli.\n\nThe number of British post offices is 34, and of telegraph offices (excluding those at railway stations) 14. Up to about 1896 a heliograph from Jaipur to Fatehpur in Shekhawati was maintained by the opium merchants of the latter town for use in their business. The State has had its own local postal system since about 1861. Letters and parcels on Darbar service are carried free. In 1901 there were 86 local post offices; and 227,072 letters, packets, and newspapers, and 326 parcels were delivered. The length of postal lines was 483 miles, the mails being carried by camels and runners; the income was Rs. 10,500 and the expenditure Rs. 17,100, including salaries of 304 employes.\n\nThere is no record of famines prior to 1868\u20139. In 1868 the rainfall between June and September was only $5\\frac{1}{2}$ inches, and the failure of forage was severe. All restrictions on the grain trade were at once abolished by the late Maharaja, and large works were started, but they were generally speaking, too near the capital. In August, 1869, the distribution of cooked food commenced at the capital, and more than 131,000 persons were fed up to March, 1870. Land revenue to the extent of a lakh was remitted, and the direct expenditure on relief works was reported to have exceeded 1.8 lakhs. There was much charity by private persons, and not a little by the Darbar. Grain was never higher in price than 8 seers per rupee. In 1877 there was a grass famine, and 30 per cent. of the cattle perished, while in 1878 the rains were late and prices rose almost to famine rates, but the distress was partial and brief. Relief works were started, and 6,000 persons were employed daily for two months till the rains set in. In 1891\u20132 there was scarcity in the west and south-west. Takari advances were given, a portion of the land revenue was remitted, and the forest Reserves were thrown open for grazing. In 1899\u20131900 acute famine prevailed everywhere, except in the Hindaun and Gangapur districts in the east, and in Kot Kasim in the north-east, where there was only scarcity. The Darbar grasped the situation from the outset, and showed both skill and common sense in combining the various branches of relief. On the 98 relief works, mostly irrigation\nprojects, nearly 21 million units were relieved at a cost of 19 lakhs. In the villages and in the poorhouse at the capital 1\u00bd million units were relieved gratuitously at a cost of a lakh. The forests were thrown open to free grazing, and the poor were permitted to remove and sell grass and firewood. Remissions of land revenue amounted to 12 lakhs, and tak\u0101vi was freely distributed. The estimated number of emigrants was 30,000, or about one per cent. of the population, and 40 per cent. of the cattle died. The scarcity of 1901\u20132 was confined to about one-third of the State, and was not severe. There was no gratuitous relief, but 693,000 units were employed on works at a cost of about 2 lakhs. Tak\u0101vi advances amounted to Rs. 41,500, and suspensions and remissions of land revenue to 3\u00b79 lakhs and Rs. 24,100 respectively.\n\nThe administration of the State is carried on by the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101, assisted by a Council of ten members. The Council consists of three departments: namely, financial; judicial; and foreign, military, and miscellaneous. There are three or four members in each department, which deals with its separate subjects in the first instance; but all matters of importance are brought before the whole Council, whose decisions are submitted to the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 for confirmation and sanction. The State comprises two main divisions or div\u0101nis, called the Eastern and Western, each under a Revenue Commissioner or Div\u0101n. These div\u0101nis are divided into ten niz\u0101ms, each under a n\u0101zim and a naib-n\u0101zim, while the niz\u0101ms are subdivided into thirty-one tahsils.\n\nAs in other States of R\u0101jput\u0101na, the civil and criminal courts of Jaipur are guided generally by the Codes of British India. The lowest courts are those of tahsild\u0101rs, which number twenty-two, nine of these officials not being invested with judicial powers. They try civil suits not exceeding Rs. 50 in value, and on the criminal side can punish with imprisonment up to one month and fine up to Rs. 11; but the tahsild\u0101r of Shekh\u0101wati has enhanced powers. He and the ten naib-n\u0101zims try civil suits not exceeding Rs. 100 in value, and in criminal cases can punish with imprisonment up to three months and fine up to Rs. 50. The ten n\u0101zims can try any civil suit arising in their districts, while, on the criminal side, nine of them, the n\u0101zim of Shekh\u0101wati having special powers, can punish with imprisonment up to two years and Rs. 200 fine, and can pass a sentence of whipping not exceeding twenty-five stripes; they also hear appeals against the decisions in civil and criminal cases of their respective tahsild\u0101rs, except in the case of the tahsild\u0101r of Shekh\u0101wati. The n\u0101zim of Shekh\u0101wati has the same original criminal powers as the Faujdari Adalat mentioned below. For the disposal of civil suits not exceeding Rs. 300 in value, instituted at the capital, there are three Munsifs; similarly the less important criminal cases at the capital are decided\nby two naib-faujd\u0101rs, who can punish with imprisonment up to six months and fine up to Rs. 100. The Ad\u0101lat Diw\u0101ni, or civil court, consists of two judges who, sitting separately, decide suits beyond the powers of the Munsifs, while jointly they hear appeals against the decisions of the tahs\u012bld\u0101r of Shekh\u0101wati, the naib-n\u0101zims, and the Munsifs. The Faujd\u0101ri Ad\u0101lat, or court of the chief magistrate, can punish with imprisonment up to four years and fine up to Rs. 400. It disposes of criminal cases beyond the powers of the n\u0101zims (excluding Shekh\u0101wati) and of the naib-faujd\u0101rs; it also hears appeals against the decisions of the tahs\u012bld\u0101r of Shekh\u0101wati and the naib-n\u0101zims. The next court is called the Appellate Court, and consists of four judges, two on the civil and two on the criminal side. The former dispose of all appeals in civil cases against the decisions of the n\u0101zims or of the civil court, while the latter, besides hearing appeals (in criminal cases) against the orders of the naib-faujd\u0101rs, n\u0101zims, and the Faujd\u0101ri Ad\u0101lat, try original cases beyond the powers of the latter, or of the n\u0101zim of Shekh\u0101wati, and can punish with imprisonment up to five years and fine up to Rs. 500. The Council is the highest court in the State and the final appellate authority in all matters, civil, criminal, and revenue. It deals with all the serious criminal cases beyond the powers of the Appellate Court, and, when presided over by the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101, can pass sentence of death on Jaipur subjects.\n\nThe normal revenue of the State is believed to be about 65 lakhs, the chief sources being land revenue (about 42 lakhs), customs (9 lakhs), receipts under the Salt treaty of 1869 and the agreement of 1879 (about 7\u00b75 lakhs), and tribute from j\u0101gird\u0101rs (4 lakhs). The normal expenditure is said to be about 59 lakhs, the main items being cost of civil and judicial staff\u00b9; army, including the Imperial Service transport corps (about 10 lakhs); public works, including irrigation (7 lakhs); tribute to Government (4 lakhs); police (about 2\u00b74 lakhs); privy purse, palace, and charities\u00b9; education (Rs. 84,000); and medical institutions and vaccination (Rs. 70,000). The State is free from debt.\n\nJaipur has a coinage of its own, called Jh\u0101r sh\u0101hi from the special mint-mark, the jh\u0101r or spray of six sprigs or branches. The coins struck are gold mohurs (the metal being quite pure), rupees, smaller silver coins, and copper pieces. The rate of exchange between local and British currency varies almost monthly; in April, 1899, the local rupee was worth about 12 annas, while at the end of 1904 102 Jh\u0101r sh\u0101hi rupees exchanged for 100 British. The question of introducing British currency as the sole legal tender is under the consideration of the Darb\u0101r.\n\nA peculiar feature of the State lies in the fact that about three-fifths\n\n\u00b9 Not available.\nof its area has been alienated in grants to nobles, ministers, priests, or courtiers, thus leaving only two-fifths as kh\u0101lsa or State lands proper. The alienated lands may be divided into those granted by the chief to members of his own family, on tenures of the nature of apanages, the holders performing no service, but paying quit-rent; those acquired by the ancestors of the present holders, such as S\u012bkar and Khetri, who pay tribute varying from one-fourth to one-twentieth of their revenue to the Darb\u0101r; those granted on the ordinary j\u0101gir tenure, for which no rent is paid but service is rendered; and those granted to temples, civil and military officers, court favourites, &c. The last are known as in\u0101ms, and are held rent-free and without any obligations as to service.\n\nIn the kh\u0101lsa area several systems prevail. In some cases the land is leased either to the actual cultivator, or to a contractor for a specified term, and the land revenue is paid in cash in four instalments during the year. In places where no such lease is given, the cultivator pays land revenue in kind, and the amount varies according to his caste or tribe and the nature and capabilities of the soil. Muhammadans and the lower castes of Hindus pay the highest rate; Brahmans the lowest. The cultivators are mere tenants-at-will; they have no hereditary rights in the land, but the right of cultivation descends from father to son, and is recognized by the State: it cannot, however, be transferred without the sanction of the Darb\u0101r. When land revenue is payable in kind, the share taken by the State varies from one-fifth to one-half of the produce: in the case of cash payments, the average rate per acre on \u2018dry\u2019 land is about Rs. 2 (maximum Rs. 4 and minimum 12 annas), and on \u2018wet\u2019 land about Rs. 5 (maximum Rs. 11 and minimum Rs. 1 12 0).\n\nThe opium produced in the State is insufficient for local requirements, the average area under poppy cultivation being about 4 square miles, and the drug is imported, generally from Kotah, M\u0101lw\u0101, and the Nimbahera district of Tonk. The import and export duties are respectively Rs. 150 and Rs. 35 per maund, the revenue from these sources averaging about Rs. 2,000. Under rules issued in 1902 no opium can be imported or exported without a permit from the Darb\u0101r, while opium in transit is liable to be seized if not covered by a pass.\n\nNo salt is manufactured in the State save by the British Government at S\u0101mbhar, nor is there any tax of any kind on this commodity. Under the treaty of 1869 and the agreement of 1879 the Darb\u0101r receives approximately a sum of 7.5 lakhs a year, including royalty on excess sales, as well as 7,000 maunds of salt free of all charges.\n\nThe Public Works department has, since 1860, been under a British officer lent by the Government of India, and it takes rank with any similar institution in British India. In addition to roads and buildings,\nthe department looks after the gas and water-works, the conservancy tramway, the cotton-presses, and the public gardens at the capital, and the numerous irrigation works in the districts. The sum available for expenditure averages about 7 lakhs a year, and the fact that between 1868 and 1901 more than 234 lakhs was spent through the department testifies to the wise and generous policy of the late and the present Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101s.\n\nThe military force consists of about 5,000 infantry divided into eight regiments, 5,000 N\u0101gas (irregular infantry), 700 cavalry, 860 artillery-men, and 100 camel sow\u0101rs. There are 60 old-fashioned guns of small calibre, and 50 zamburas or small camel-guns. Besides these forces, the j\u0101gird\u0101rs keep up 5,782 horsemen who serve the Darb\u0101r. The State further maintains an Imperial Service transport corps. The raising of this corps commenced in 1889\u201390, and it was at full strength (1,000 ponies with two trained men to every three animals, and 400 carts) in 1893\u20134. The cost of raising and maintaining up to that year was nearly 7 lakhs; and the annual cost of maintenance in future was estimated at 2.1 lakhs. The corps accompanied the Chitr\u0101l Relief force in 1895, leaving Jaipur within forty-eight hours of receipt of orders, and did well. In 1896 the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 added 200 ponies. In 1897\u20138 the corps served throughout the Tir\u0101h campaign, and its services were warmly appreciated. The present strength is 1,200 ponies, 558 folding iron carts, 16 ambulance tongas, and 722 officers, non-commissioned officers, and men; and the annual cost is 2.5 lakhs. The entire military expenditure of the State is about 10 lakhs. A small detachment from the 42nd (Deoli) Regiment is quartered at the Jaipur Residency for escort and guard duty, while at S\u0101mbhar are 3 non-commissioned officers and 18 men of the 44th Merw\u0101ra Infantry guarding the Salt department treasury. There are 117 members of the 2nd Battalion Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway Volunteer Rifles in the State: namely, 82 at B\u0101ndikui, 28 at Phalera, and 7 at the capital.\n\nThe police may be divided into two bodies: namely, the city police under the Faujd\u0101r, with a strength of 855 constables and chaukid\u0101rs, and the district police under a Superintendent. The latter force consists of 11 deputy-superintendents, 160 th\u0101nad\u0101rs, 582 constables, and 11,058 chaukid\u0101rs. The combined forces cost about 2.4 lakhs a year. The principal criminal tribes are the Min\u0101s (who number 241,000) and the Baoris (1,177). The latter give little trouble, but the former have for a long time been a thorn in the side of the State. As already mentioned, there are two kinds of Min\u0101s, namely zamind\u0101rs (cultivators) and chaukid\u0101rs (watchmen), but they are difficult to distinguish. Some are honest zamind\u0101rs, while others hold land as a screen behind which they can pursue avocations of another kind. Again, there are Min\u0101s\nwho serve as useful watchmen; and there are those who use their opportunities as such to steal the cattle of their own village, passing the animals on to confederates, and who then proceed to make money out of the real owners by arranging for the restoration of the stolen property. The Darb\u0101r has since 1897 taken up the question of settling down the Min\u0101s, and is trying to reclaim them.\n\nUp to 1889 the only jail was at the capital; it had accommodation for about 370 prisoners, and was always overcrowded. The construction of an additional jail was started in 1887, and the building was completed and occupied by 1889. These two institutions, known respectively as the Central and the District jails, now have accommodation for 1,144 prisoners (1,034 males and 110 females). In 1904 the daily average number of prisoners was 961, and there was overcrowding in the Central jail, where all females are confined. Jail products include woollen carpets, which are famous and command a ready sale, cotton rugs, and dusters. Besides these prisons, small lock-ups are maintained in the districts, regarding which no particulars are available.\n\nIn respect of the literacy of its population Jaipur stands fourteenth among the twenty States and chiefships of R\u0101jput\u0101na, with only 2\u00b752 per cent. (4\u00b77 males and 0\u00b71 females) able to read and write, according to the Census of 1901, yet in the number of educational institutions, the excellence of some of them, and the successes obtained at public examinations the State undoubtedly takes the lead. The number of pupils under instruction rose from 10,772 at the end of 1880\u20131 to 20,277 in 1890\u20131, but fell, in consequence of the famine of 1899\u20131900 and the sickness which followed it, to 16,010 in 1900\u20131, and has risen again to 23,952 by the end of 1904. In the year last mentioned, 10\u00b79 per cent. of the male, 0\u00b74 of the female, and 6 per cent. of the entire population of school-going age were under instruction. In 1904 there were 753 educational institutions in the State: namely, 151 public and 602 private. Of the former 77 are maintained by the Darb\u0101r, and 74 are under private management, though more or less under the supervision of the department: namely, 18 maintained by j\u0101gird\u0101rs, 12 by the Jain community, 10 by the United Free Church of Scotland Mission, and 34 by bankers or private individuals. The public institutions consist of 3 colleges (noticed in the article on Jaipur City), and 25 secondary (of which 9 are Anglo-veracular), 118 primary, and 5 special schools. The private institutions are of the indigenous variety (chats\u0101ls and maktab\u0101s) conducted on primitive lines; 74 of them are classed as advanced and 528 as elementary. Of the 23,952 pupils under instruction in 1904, 1,742 were studying English (71 in the collegiate stage, 95 in the high school, 166 in the middle school, and 1,410 in the primary stage); 21,761 were studying the\nvernaculars, including Sanskrit, Arabic, and Persian (139 in the collegiate stage, 86 in the middle school, and 21,536 in the primary stage); and 449 were attending the special schools, namely the School of Arts, the painting school, and the carpet-weaving schools, all at the capital. Of the total number under instruction at the end of 1904, 78 per cent. were Hindus, about 9 per cent. Muhammadans, and 12 per cent. Jains. There are eleven girls' schools in the State: namely, nine at the capital, one at Amber, and one at Sambhar; they were attended in 1904 by 797 girls. Education is provided free throughout the State, no fees being charged anywhere; and the total expenditure from all sources in 1904 was 1.3 lakhs, of which the Darbar contributed nearly 69 per cent. and the various jagirdars about 10 per cent.\n\nIncluding the small hospitals attached to the jails and the lunatic asylum, the State possesses 29 hospitals and dispensaries, which have accommodation for about 350 in-patients. Of these institutions, seven are maintained by jagirdars and the rest by the Darbar. In 1904 the number of cases treated was 209,041, of whom 3,937 were in-patients, and 10,808 operations were performed. The total expenditure was Rs. 66,700, excluding cost of supervision, buildings, repairs, and the like. All these institutions are supervised by the Residency Surgeon, who is also in charge of the small Residency hospital maintained by the British Government. In addition, hospitals at Bandikui and Phalera are kept up by the Rajputana-Malwa Railway, and the Salt department has a hospital at Sambhar.\n\nThe lunatic asylum is in good repair, and the inmates are well cared for and properly controlled; 110 insane persons were treated in 1904, the daily average being 74.\n\nVaccination is nominally compulsory everywhere, but is especially backward in some of the jagir estates. In 1904-5 a staff of 47 vaccinators under 2 native superintendents and the Residency Surgeon successfully vaccinated 79,000 persons, or about 30 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n[J. C.

Jaipur is the largest city in Rajputana, its area,\nincluding suburbs, being 3 square miles. Its population at the three enumerations was: (1881) 142,578, (1891) 158,787, and (1901) 160,167. The small increase during the last decade of less than one per cent. occurred entirely in the suburbs, the population of the city proper being less by 330 than in 1891. The latter circumstance was largely due to the year 1900 having been a very unhealthy one: 13,874 deaths occurred within the city walls, or a rate of nearly 105 per 1,000, compared with an average for twenty-six years of about 45 per 1,000. Cholera prevailed almost incessantly till September, and a severe outbreak of malarial fever immediately followed. Hindus number 110,601, or 69 per cent. of the total; Musalmans, 40,386, or 25 per cent.; and Jains, 8,726, or 5 per cent.\n\nThe city takes its name from the famous Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Sawai Jai Singh, by whom it was founded in 1728. It stands on a small plain conjectured to be the bed of a dried-up lake, and is surrounded on all sides except the south by rugged hills, the summits of which are crowned with forts at all important points. At the end of the ridge, about 500 feet above the city on the north-west, is the chief defensive work, the N\u0101hargarh or 'tiger fort,' the rock face of which is so scarped as to be inaccessible on the south or city side, while on the north the ridge slopes towards Amber. A masonry crenelated wall, averaging in height 20 feet and in thickness 9 feet, encloses the whole city. In the wall are seven gateways, all built on the same pattern, with two kiosks above and machicolis over the entrance, and at intervals are bastions and towers pierced for cannon, while the parapet is loopholed for musketry. The city is remarkable for the regularity and width of its streets. Tod described it as being as regular as Darmstadt and the only city in India built upon a regular plan. It is laid out in rectangular blocks, and divided by cross streets into six equal portions, which are in turn intersected at regular intervals by narrower alleys. The main streets are 111 feet in width, the secondary ones 55, and the smaller 27\u00bd feet. The Mah\u0101r\u0101ja's palace forms an imposing pile in the centre, occupying with its pleasure-grounds about one-seventh of the city area. To the north of the palace is the T\u0101l Katora tank, enclosed by a masonry wall, and beyond it again is the R\u0101j\u0101 M\u0101l-k\u0101-talao, about 100 acres in area and stocked with crocodiles. One of the most interesting antiquities of the State is the observatory (jantra) erected by Sawai Jai Singh. The instruments, consisting of dials, azimuth circles, altitude pillars, &c., are of huge size, and have recently been put in order under the supervision of an officer lent to the Darb\u0101r by the British Government.\n\nThe main streets, the large public institutions, the palace, and some private residences are lighted with gas at a cost of about Rs. 28,000 a year. Since 1874 good drinking-water has been brought into the\ncity from the Am\u0101n-i-Sh\u0101h river, about 1\u00bd miles west of the Ch\u0101nd Pol gate. Pumping engines raise the water to a height of 109 feet, where it is stored in covered reservoirs and thence delivered in the city in iron pipes under 50 feet pressure. The daily average consumption in 1904 was 497,000 gallons, or about three gallons per head, and the cost of maintenance was Rs. 28,170. There has been a municipality since 1868; the board consists of 26 nominated members, including a health officer and an engineer. All the receipts are paid into, and the entire expenditure is met from, the State treasury. The refuse of the city is removed by a light tramway drawn by buffaloes, and incinerators have been erected at convenient spots. The principal arts and industries are dyeing, carving in marble, enamelling on gold, pottery, and brass-work. The School of Art, opened in 1868, has done much useful work; drawing, painting, sculpture, wood-carving, pottery, and working in gold and brass are taught, and the daily average attendance in 1904 was 81. For such a large place very little trade is carried on, but there is an extensive banking and exchange business, and Jaipur has been described as a sort of Lombard Street to Rajput\u0101na. Outside the city are two steam hydraulic cotton-presses started in 1885. In 1904, 12,910 bales were pressed, the net revenue being Rs. 13,444, or a profit of about 6 per cent. on the capital cost. Jaipur is amply supplied with educational institutions. Including 113 indigenous schools (chats\u016bls and maktab) attended by 2,535 children, there were, in 1904, 151 educational institutions, and the daily average attendance was 4,446. The Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101's College deserves special mention. It was started in 1845, the curriculum consisting of Urd\u016b and Persian with the rudiments of English; it became a high school about 1865, a second-grade college in 1873, and a first-grade college in 1897. The daily average attendance in 1904 was 54, and the expenditure Rs. 24,900. Since 1891, 67 students from the college have passed the B.A., and 4 the M.A. examination. There are two other colleges in the city: namely, the Oriental College, teaching up to the highest standards of the Punjab University examinations in Arabic and Persian; and the Sanskrit College, preparing boys for the title examinations in that language. In 1904 the daily average attendance at the former was 25, and at the latter 56. The city is also well supplied with medical institutions, there being three dispensaries for out-patients, two jail hospitals, a lunatic asylum, a small hospital attached to the Residency, the Lansdowne Hospital for the use of the Imperial Service transport corps, and the Mayo Hospital. The latter, with its recent additions, detached operating room, private and eye wards, is one of the most completely equipped hospitals in India and has beds for 125 in-patients. The two jails are outside the city walls and have accommodation for 1,144 prisoners. Besides cotton, rugs\nand dusters, good woollen carpets are manufactured. In the beautifully laid out R\u0101m New\u0101s public gardens, which are 76 acres in extent, and are maintained at a cost of about Rs. 17,000 a year, is the Albert Hall, a large museum of industrial art and educational models, and the principal architectural feature of the place. It is named after King Edward VII, who, as Prince of Wales, laid the foundation-stone on February 6, 1876.\n\nJaipur Village.\u2014Village in the Dibrugarh subdivision of Lakhimpur District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $27^\\circ 16' N.$ and $95^\\circ 23' E.$, on the left bank of the Buri Dihing river. There are deposits of coal and oil-bearing strata in the neighbourhood, and the place is a centre of local trade.\n\nJaipur.\u2014Zam\u012bnd\u0101r\u012b tahsil and estate in Vizagapatam District, Madras. See Jeypore.\n\nJais.\u2014Town in the Salon tahsil of R\u0101e Bareli District, United Provinces, situated in $26^\\circ 16' N.$ and $81^\\circ 33' E.$, on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, and on the road from Lucknow to Sult\u0101npur. Population (1901), 12,688. It is said to have been originally a Bhar fortress called Udayanagar or Uj\u0101lek\u0101nagar. Tradition relates that the place was stormed by an officer of Saiyid S\u0101l\u0101r, and its modern name is derived from the Persian jaish, \u2018a camp.\u2019 The J\u0101ma Masjid is the chief building. This was built with the materials of an old Hindu temple, and was restored by Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Sh\u0101h of Jaunpur. Other fine buildings were erected in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Jais is celebrated as being the birthplace of Muhammad Jais\u012b, author of the vernacular poem called the Padm\u0101vat\u012b, who lived early in the sixteenth century. Excellent muslin was formerly manufactured here; but the industry has declined. There is, however, some trade in grain, tobacco, and coarse cotton cloth. The town contains a dispensary and a flourishing school with 137 pupils.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File":
