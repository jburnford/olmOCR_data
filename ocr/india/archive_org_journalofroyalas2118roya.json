Grant's gold Gupta coins are now in the Ermitage Imp\u00e9rial at St.\nPetersburg.\nPrefatory Note.\n\nMy paper entitled 'A Classified and Detailed Catalogue of the Gold Coins of the Imperial Gupta Dynasty of Northern India, with an Introductory Essay,' written in 1883, and published in 1884 by the Asiatic Society of Bengal, gave a full account of the Gupta gold coinage, so far as it was then known. At that time it was not in my power to extend my investigations to the silver and copper coinage, and subsequent criticism and study showed that my discussion of the gold coins was in some respects defective and erroneous. An interval of rest from official work has now given me an opportunity of resuming my numismatic studies, and of completing and bringing up to date my examination of the Gupta coinage.\n\nNumismatic science is fortunately progressive, and in course of time fresh discoveries and researches necessarily superannuate every treatise. In the following pages I have endeavoured to include all information concerning the Gupta coinage in gold, silver, and copper, which is at present available, but I cannot profess to have exhausted my subject, limited though it is, and have no doubt that the publication of this monograph will, like that of its predecessor, elicit new facts, and necessitate correction in some of the views now expressed.\n\nI have re-examined all the gold Gupta coins in the British Museum, and have studied the fine Bodleian collection, respecting which the information previously supplied to me was very defective. The additional knowledge thus obtained, and much other detailed information derived from various sources, have enabled me to make many additions to, and corrections in, the account of the gold coinage, which has been re-written throughout.\n\nThe copper coinage is now discussed in detail for the first time. It is, of course, much less interesting than the gold coinage, so remarkable for variety of type, but appears to me not unworthy of attention.\n\nThe silver coins have been described at considerable length\nby previous writers, and I have not very much that is new to say about them, but I hope that the orderly arrangement of all available information on the subject will be welcome and useful.\n\nMy obligations to the gentlemen who helped me in preparing the catalogue of the gold coins are on record, and my acknowledgments to them need not now be repeated. On the present occasion I have much pleasure in tendering my special thanks for assistance rendered by Major-General Sir A. Cunningham, K.C.I.E.; Mr. J. F. Fleet, C.I.E.; Dr. A. F. Rudolf Hoernl\u00e9; Mr. E. Nicholson, Bodley Librarian; Messrs. Grueber and Rapson of the Coin Room in the British Museum; and Mr. W. Theobald. Sir A. Cunningham, with his usual liberality, placed his unrivalled cabinet and knowledge at my disposal, and, so far as I could venture to trespass on his kindness, I have made use of both. Mr. Fleet favoured me with proofs of his great work on the Gupta inscriptions, which determines the date of the coins discussed in the following pages, and the remaining gentlemen named have given me much valuable help in various ways. My minor obligations to other gentlemen are duly acknowledged in the text or footnotes.\n\nThe favourable reception accorded to my previous imperfect essay encourages me to hope that its more complete successor may prove of interest to the limited class of readers whom it concerns, and that it may stimulate further research in that section of the Indian numismatic field, which seems to me to offer a harvest more varied and abundant than that produced by any other. Coins interest me only as being documents illustrative of history\u2014artistic, linguistic, social, religious, and political\u2014and, when closely interrogated, they can be forced to answer questions in every department of history. The minute description and discussion of uncurrent pieces of old metal appears to many to be no better than elaborate trifling, and is best justified by the aphorism of Saint-Hilaire: \"La Numismatique est patiente, et elle amasse les faits sp\u00e9ciaux qui la concernent, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que l'histoire vienne plus tard en donner la v\u00e9ritable clef, si\njamais elle le peut.\" In India history often fails to answer the call of her numismatic sister, but the study of the Gupta coinage derives a special interest from the fact that it rests throughout on independent historical documents, which it amplifies and illustrates.\n\nChapter I.\u2014Historical Introduction.\n\nThe Indo-Scythian dynasties which governed Northern India during the first three centuries of the Christian era were displaced in the fourth century throughout their dominions, except the Panj\u00e2b, where they continued to rule, by a dynasty known by the name of its progenitor Gupta,\\(^1\\) whose personal appellation was adopted as a family name by all his successors, save one.\n\nThis dynasty is called by Mr. Fleet that of the Early Guptas, in order to distinguish it from other reigning houses with the same family name which held sway in Magadha and elsewhere in times subsequent to its fall.\n\nIn my previous publication on the subject I called it the Imperial Gupta dynasty in order to emphasize the fact that it is distinguished from its provincial successors by the imperial rule which it exercised over all Northern India, from Nep\u00e2l to the Narbad\u00e2 River, and from Western Bengal to the Gulf of Kachchh. The term Imperial still seems to me preferable to the purely relative term Early.\n\nWhen I formerly described the Gupta gold coins, the difficult problem of the Gupta chronology was still unsolved, and I followed high authority in provisionally accepting an erroneous solution. Mr. J. F. Fleet's recent researches have demonstrated that the kings of the Early or Imperial Gupta Dynasty dated their inscriptions and coins in an era, com-\n\n\\(^1\\) I formerly followed other writers in calling this prince by the name of S\u00fbri Gupta, that is to say, in treating the honorific prefix S\u00fbri as an integral part of the name. But I now admit the validity of the arguments adduced by Mr. Fleet to show that his name was simply Gupta (Ind. Ant. vol. xiv. p. 94; Corpus Inscrip. Ind. vol. iii. p. 8, note 3). I take this opportunity of correcting the mistake I made in supposing that Sir A. Cunningham agreed with Mr. Thomas in erroneously assigning a certain silver coin to (S\u00fbri) Gupta. Sir A. Cunningham assures me that he never did so. I misinterpreted a passage in one of his letters.\nmonly called the Gupta Era, of which the year A.D. 320-21 was the year 1. This fact has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt, and the proof of it has reduced the history of Northern India during the early centuries of the Christian era from chaos to order.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe numerous inscriptions of the Imperial Guptas, confirmed by the numismatic evidence, prove that their dynasty consisted of seven princes, lineally connected as father and son; namely,\n\n(1) Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Gupta Acc. circa A.D. 300.\n(2) \u201d Gha\u1e6dotkacha \\(^2\\) \u201d \u201d \u201d 315.\n(3) Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101dhir\u0101j\u0101 Chandra Gupta I. Acc. circa A.D. 340. Married Kum\u0101ra Dev\u012b of the Lichchhav\u012b or Lichchhivi family of Nep\u0101l.\\(^3\\)\n(4) \u201d Samudra Gupta. Acc. circa A.D. 365. Married Dattadev\u012b. Probably identical with K\u0101cha.\n(5) \u201d Chandra Gupta II. Acc. circa A.D. 390. Married Dhruvadev\u012b.\n(6) \u201d Kum\u0101ra Gupta. Acc. circa A.D. 414.\n(7) \u201d Skanda Gupta. \u201d \u201d \u201d 452. Died circa A.D. 480.\n\nThe first two princes, who bore only the inferior title of Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101, were evidently local chiefs, and probably ruled\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The detailed proof will be found in the Introduction to volume iii. of the Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, and in a less complete form in Ind. Ant. vol. xv. p. 279, etc.\n\n\\(^2\\) The name Gha\u1e6dotkacha is in form a compound of ghata and utkacha, with the nonsensical meaning of \u2018a jar with hair on end.\u2019 It is probably a foreign name Sanskritised. The name is of rare occurrence, but is given in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata to the son of Bh\u012bma by Hidimb\u0101 (Ind. Ant. vol. xiv. June, 1885), and also designates a small group of caves near Ajant\u0101, dating from A.D. 500 or 600. (Fergusson and Burgess, Cave Temples of India, pp. 186, 346; Arch. Survey W.T. vol. iv. p. 60). The name of the king Gha\u1e6dotkacha does not occur in the Tu\u1e63\u0101m inscription, as was formerly supposed (Corpus Inser. Ind. vol. iii. p. 269, No. 67).\n\n\\(^3\\) Recent research has shown that two contemporary dynasties ruled in Nep\u0101l. The Lichchhavi or S\u016bryavanshi family had its capital at M\u0101nagruha, and seems to have ruled Eastern Nep\u0101l. The rival Thakur\u012b family had its capital at Kail\u0101s\u0101k\u016bntalabhavana, and apparently governed Western Nep\u0101l. The Lichchhavi family used the era which was adopted by the Guptas, perhaps in the reign of Chandra Gupta I, while the Thakur\u012b dynasty employed the era of Harsha Vardhana (A.D. 606). Our earliest Nep\u0101l inscriptions belong to the seventh century A.D. (Ind. Ant. vol. xiv. p. 349, and Corpus Inser. Ind. vol. iii. Introduction).\nin Magadha or Bih\u00e2r, subject to the suzerainty of an Indo-\nScythian over-lord.\n\nThe third prince, Chandra Gupta I., who married into the\nLichchhavi family, then ruling in Nep\u00e2l, assumed the higher\ntitle of Mah\u00e2r\u00e2j\u00e2dhir\u00e2ja, or sovereign of Mah\u00e2r\u00e2j\u00e2s, and\nappears to have been the real founder of the greatness of his\nhouse. But we have no specific knowledge of the events of\nhis reign, nor of those of the reigns of his predecessors.\n\nSamudra Gupta, son and successor of Chandra Gupta I.,\nwas undoubtedly a very powerful sovereign, whose authority\nextended over the greater part of Northern India. The\nextent of his dominions is described with considerable detail\nin the celebrated inscription on the pillar of A\u015boka in the\nFort at All\u00e2h\u00e2b\u00e2d, which was recorded early in the reign of\nhis successor.\n\nThis successor bore, according to Hindu custom, the same\nname as his grandfather, and is known to us as Chandra\nGupta II. With him begins the series of contemporary\nepigraphical records. Inscriptions of his reign are dated\nin 82, 88, and 93 G.E., equivalent to the years A.D. 401-2,\n407-8, and 412-13, and we cannot be far wrong if we assume\nthat his reign began in or about the year A.D. 390. By\nmaking the usual allowance of twenty-five years for each\ngeneration, we obtain the dates 365 and 340 A.D. respectively\nfor the accession of Samudra Gupta and Chandra Gupta I.,\nas above stated.\n\nThe limiting dates of the reign of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta are\nknown with certainty, subject to a possible error of a year\nor two. Kum\u00e2ra Gupta enjoyed a very long reign, which\nbegan in or about the year A.D. 414, and lasted probably till\nA.D. 452, when Skanda Gupta ascended the throne, of which\n\n---\n\n1 The Gay\u00e2 copper-plate inscription, dated in the year 9, purports to have\nbeen executed at Ayodhy\u00e2 by order of Samudra Gupta; but Mr. Fleet shows\nthat the document is an ancient forgery, probably executed about the beginning\nof the eighth century A.D. The seal, however, \"is in all probability a genuine\none of Samudra Gupta, detached from another plate.\" But it is too much worn\nto be of value as a contemporary record (Corpus Inscr. Ind. vol. iii. p. 254,\nNo. 60). The era in which the grant purports to be dated is not specified, but\nif the forger meant to use the so-called Gupta era, he must have believed that\nSamudra Gupta was reigning in A.D. 328-29, and it is hardly possible that the\nbelief was correct. The forger may have meant the regnal year.\nhe retained possession, certainly, till A.D. 467, and, probably, till A.D. 480.\n\nWe know that the dominions of Skanda Gupta extended from the borders of Eastern Nep\u00e2l to the shores of the Gulf of Kaehehh, and that his peace was disturbed by the inroads of a tribe of foreigners named H\u00fb\u1e47as. Their attacks ultimately broke up the great Gupta empire, and Skanda Gupta was the last of his house who enjoyed imperial dignity and power. In a portion of his western dominions he was succeeded by Budha Gupta, very probably his son, whose inscription dated 165 G.E., = A.D. 484-85, is at Eran in the S\u00e2gar District of the Central Provinces. Coins prove that Budha Gupta was still ruling his diminished territory in A.D. 500, or a year or two later.\n\nBudha Gupta appears to have been succeeded in the west by the H\u00fb\u1e47a chiefs Toram\u00e2\u1e47a and Mihirakula, who have left both inscriptions and coins as memorials of their reigns.\n\nIn Eastern Magadha, at the eastern extremity of his dominions, Skanda Gupta was immediately succeeded (circa A.D. 480) by Krishna Gupta, who was doubtless a son or other near relative of the deceased Emperor. Krishna Gupta was followed by ten princes of his line, the last of whom was J\u00eevita Gupta II., who came to the provincial throne about A.D. 720. This dynasty is known as that of the Later Guptas of Magadha, and appears to have possessed only a very local authority. During the period of its rule Western Magadha was governed by the rival, and often hostile, dynasty of the Maukhari, or Mukhara, kings, whose names generally ended with the word Varman or Varm\u00e2. During the reign of the great king Harsha Vardhana of Kanauj (A.D. 606-7 to A.D. 648) all Northern India, including Magadha with its local chiefs, was subject to his suzerainty.\u00b9\n\nBesides the Later Guptas of Eastern Magadha we find traces of other minor Gupta dynasties in Orissa and elsewhere, all perhaps connected with that imperial race which had\n\n\u00b9 The foregoing historical summary is based on Mr. Flect's work on the Gupta Inscriptions, vol. iii. of the Corpus Inscrip. Ind.\nexercised sovereign power for about a century and a half.\\(^1\\)\n\nI propose to confine my detailed discussion and description of the Gupta coinage to that of the Imperial Dynasty and of Budha Gupta. An exhaustive examination of the coinages of Toram\u00e2na, Mihirakula, the Later Guptas of Magadha, the N\u00e2gas of Narw\u00e2r, and the other mints more or less closely connected with the coinage of the Imperial Guptas, would, even if I were prepared to undertake it, expand my work beyond all reasonable limits, and I have preferred to confine myself to a compact, well-defined subject, which is sufficiently limited to admit of treatment, which may make some claim to completeness, until fresh discoveries render additions or corrections necessary.\n\nBut, while thus limiting myself, I have not thought it necessary to remain absolutely silent about all the subsidiary coinages, and have permitted myself to make brief excursions into some adjacent fields, which are not included within the boundary of my plan.\n\nThe Mah\u00e2r\u00e2j\u00e2s Gupta and Gha\u1e6dotkacha, who occupy the first and second places in the dynastic list, seem not to have attained sufficiently high rank to warrant them in exercising the prerogative of coinage, and we need not expect ever to discover coins bearing their names. Certain gold coins were formerly attributed to Gha\u1e6dotkacha, but erroneously.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe numismatic record of the Imperial Gupta dynasty begins with the first \u2018sovereign of Mah\u00e2r\u00e2j\u00e2s,\u2019 Chandra Gupta I., whose coinage is represented only by a few gold pieces of a single type. The scarcity of his coinage perhaps indicates a short reign.\n\nHis son and successor, Samudra Gupta, likewise, struck coins, so far as is known, in gold only, but his mint-masters issued them in at least six well-defined and distinct types.\n\nThe western extension of the Empire to Guzer\u00e2t and K\u00e2thi\u00e2w\u00e2r appears to have been the work of Chandra\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Guptas of Mah\u00e2 Kosala, or Central Provinces (Arch. Rep. vol. vii. p. vi; vol. xvii. pp. 17, 85, 87); of Orissa (ibid. vol. xvii. pp. 17, 85, 87); of Western Gauda, in Central Provinces (ibid. vol. ix. p. 156).\n\n\\(^2\\) See post, coins of K\u00e2cha in Catalogue of Gold Coins, p. 74.\nGupta II., who issued a silver coinage based on that struck by the Satraps of Saur\u0101sh\u1e6dra in imitation of Gr\u00e6co-Bactrian hemidrachms. The extreme rarity of the silver coins of Chandra Gupta II., when contrasted with the abundant finds of the silver coinage of his successors, indicates that his silver mintage was small in amount and late in his reign. He also struck copper coins in his northern dominions of four types, three of which are very rare, while one is tolerably common. The gold coinage of Chandra Gupta II. occurs in at least eight different types. Most of these are scarce, and some are known only from unique specimens, but examples of the Archer type are sufficiently numerous to show that the issue of it must have been a very large one. The inscriptions, unfortunately, do not determine the initial date of the reign of Chandra Gupta II., and consequently we do not know its exact duration, but the number and variety of his extant coins warrant the inference that it was long.\n\nThe stone inscriptions and dated silver coins of Kum\u0101ra Gupta enable us to fix almost exactly the limits of his reign, which we know to have lasted about thirty-eight years. Several types of his silver coins have been discovered, and specimens of one type have been found in very large numbers. His copper coins are exceedingly rare, and only one or two specimens have yet been recognized. His gold coinage equals in variety of type that of his father, and examples of some forms of it are fairly abundant, though none can be called common.\n\nThe date of the conclusion of the reign of Skanda Gupta is not known with certainty, but he probably reigned for a period of twenty-five or nearly thirty years. His rude silver coins, which were struck in his western dominions, are numerous, but the better-executed coins in the same metal, which issued from his northern mints, appear to be rather scarce. One variety of his gold coinage has been found in considerable numbers, but the other forms are rare. His gold coinage is much less varied than that of his father and grandfather.\nThe coinage of Budha Gupta is known only from six specimens of a single type in silver. Of Toram\u0101\u1e47a we possess only two silver coins, but the copper coinage of his son Mihirakula is tolerably abundant. The silver coinage of Bh\u012bma Sena and Krishna R\u0101j\u0101 is known from a few rare coins.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe Later Guptas of Magadha seem to have coined only in gold, or base metal purporting to be gold, but their coinage has not been investigated with sufficient detail to enable me to indicate the rarity of their several issues. All, however, seem to be rather scarce.\n\nThree examples are known of the silver coinage of \u012a\u015b\u0101na Varman, a member of the Maukhari dynasty of Western Magadha, but I do not know of any specimen of the gold coinage of this family.\\(^2\\)\n\nWith this explanation of the limits which I have imposed on myself, I now proceed to the discussion of the coinage which I have undertaken to describe.\n\n**Chapter II.\u2014Types and Devices.**\n\nThe Gupta gold coinage is remarkable for its great variety of type. The obverse devices are much more characteristic than the reverse ones, and necessarily form the primary basis for classification.\n\nThe gold coins, arranged according to their obverse devices, may be conveniently classified as follows:\n\n**Types of Gold Coins.**\n\n| Reign               | Type                  |\n|---------------------|-----------------------|\n| Chandra Gupta I.    | 1.

The only exception to this statement is afforded by the newly-discovered Javelin type of Chandra Gupta II., the reverse device of which consists of the King and Queen seated on a couch, a design better suited for the obverse than for the reverse.\n\nThe reverse devices of the gold coins may be grouped as follows:\n\nClass I.\u2014Standing Goddess.\n\nDevice.

The obverse devices are all, with the exception of those of the A\u015bwamedha medals, primarily representations, more or less conventional, of the several kings from whose mints the coins issued, but in some cases the die-artists evidently intended the obverse designs to have a mythological significance as well as those of the reverse.\n\nI shall now proceed to discuss, as far as my limited knowledge permits, the meaning and origin of the great variety of devices enumerated above, dealing first with the gold coins.\n\nThe legends of the King and Queen coins of Chandra Gupta I. leave no doubt that the effigies on the obverse are primarily intended for the sovereign and his consort Kum\u0101ra Dev\u012b, a member of the Lichchhavi family. The queen\u2019s name is known from the stone inscriptions, as well as the coins. The king is figured leaning on a spear, and this device may be intended secondarily to symbolize Kum\u0101ra Deva, the god of war, and husband of Kum\u0101r\u012b Dev\u012b. The reverse goddess seated on a lion is probably Durg\u0101, another form of Kum\u0101r\u012b Dev\u012b, but the cornucopiae in her left arm indicates that the deity is presented under her beneficent,\n\n\u00b9 Ind.

The unique coin of Kum\u0101ra Gupta, which I have classed as the Two Queens type, presents the figure of the king standing between two females, and I can only suppose that the female figures are intended for his queens. It is quite certain that the central figure is the king, because he is labelled Kum\u0101ra Gupta, and it is therefore impossible to suppose that it is intended primarily for a god. It is, of course, possible that the device may have a secondary mythological signification. The attitude of the king on this coin suggested to Dr. Hoernl\u00e9 a recollection of the conventional figure of Buddha,\\(^1\\) but there is no reason whatever to suppose that any of the Gupta kings were Buddhists. Both inscriptions and coins, on the contrary, show clearly that they were Brahmanists. It is curious that the king of the Two Queens coin is smaller than either of the female figures. The male and female figures seated together on a couch on the reverse of the unique Javelin coin of Chandra Gupta II. appear intended for the king and his consort.\n\nThe obverse device of the Javelin coins of Samudra Gupta is obviously borrowed directly from that of the Indo-Scythian gold coins. It also bears a strong resemblance to the obverse of certain Macedonian coins. The figure on these latter coins has generally been described as that of a Roman emperor, but Professor Gardner prefers to regard it as an effigy of the god Ares (Mars).\\(^2\\) I think that the design of the Gupta coins was influenced by that of the Macedonian. The device reappears on the unique Javelin coin of Chandra Gupta II.\n\nIn his Archer type Samudra Gupta substitutes for the javelin in the king's hand a bow, and the device thus\n\n\\(^1\\) Proc. A.S.B. Nov. 1883, p. 144.\n\n\\(^2\\) \"Ares as a Sun-god, and Solar Symbols on the Coins of Macedon and Thrace,\" by Percy Gardner (Num. Chron., vol. xx. n.s. p. 56, pl. iv. fig. 4).\nintroduced long remained the favourite obverse pattern. It is found on the coins of Chandra Gupta II., Kum\u0101ra Gupta, and Skanda Gupta, and is the standard device of the barbarous gold coins of the obscure successors of the Imperial dynasty in the eastern provinces.\n\nThe device of the Archer coins may have been suggested by the Persian darics,\\(^1\\) but this is not probable. If it had any symbolic meaning, it most likely was intended to suggest an analogy between the king who rules the earth and the sun that rules the heavens. The conception of the sun as an archer is familiar to poetry and mythology.\n\nThe unique Couch coin of Chandra Gupta II., which exhibits the king seated alone on a couch, with one leg tucked up under him, is copied from a common type of Indo-Scythian coins, and figures in the same attitude may be observed in the sculptures at Amar\u0101vat\u012b, dating from the close of the second century A.D.\n\nThe king of the rare Lyrist type of Samudra Gupta is seated in nearly the same attitude, but is engaged playing an Indian lyre (\\(v\u012b\u1e47\u0101\\)). This device is clearly intended to commemorate the special accomplishments of Samudra Gupta, \"who put to shame (K\u0101\u015byapa) the preceptor of (Indra) the lord of the gods, and Tumburu, and N\u0101rada, and others, by (his) sharp and polished intellect, and choral skill and musical accomplishments; who established his title of 'king of poets' by various poetical compositions that were fit to be the means of subsistence of learned people.\" N\u0101rada, with whom Samudra Gupta is compared, was the reputed inventor of the lyre.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe Lyrist coins (Pl. I. 5), with the exception of the India Office specimen (Pl. I. 6), are broad, thin, medal-like pieces,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I take this opportunity of remarking that an incidental reference of mine to Persian darics (J.A S.B. part i. vol. liii. p. 149) exaggerated the rarity of these coins. Sir A. Cunningham informs me that 300 were found in Xerxes' canal at Mount Athos, and that there is no reason to suppose that Warren Hastings was mistaken in describing as darics the 172 gold pieces found near Benares, which he sent home to the Court of Directors, and which speedily disappeared.\n\n\\(^2\\) Line 27 of the Allahabad Pillar inscription in Corpus Inscrip. Indic. vol. iii. p 14, notes 1 and 2. Lines 6 and 16 of the same inscription also refer to the mental gifts of Samudra Gupta.\nwell-struck, and superior in execution to most of the Gupta coins.\n\nThe coins of the A\u015bwamedha type differ from all the other types by having on the obverse the figure of a horse instead of that of the king. The legend does not give the name of the king who struck them, but records that he had power to effect the A\u015bwamedha sacrifice. These coins can only be ascribed to Samudra Gupta, \"who was the restorer of the A\u015bwamedha sacrifice, which had been long in abeyance.\"\u00b9\n\nThe fact, known from the inscriptions, that Samudra Gupta actually did perform the sacrifice of the horse, which was incumbent on a claimant to the universal sovereignty of India, would alone suffice to justify the ascription to him of the A\u015bwamedha pieces; and the attribution is fully confirmed by the evidence yielded by the coins themselves, the legends of which are connected with those of the Javelin, Archer, and Lyrist types of Samudra Gupta. The syllable \u0936\u093f, 'Si,' which occurs on the exergue of both the Lyrist and A\u015bwamedha coins, has not yet been explained.\u00b2\n\nI have no doubt that the A\u015bwamedha pieces were struck as medals to commemorate the successful performance of the horse sacrifice, and were distributed to the officiating Brahmins. The Bilsar inscription expressly refers to Samudra Gupta as \"the giver of millions of gold, performer of the A\u015bwamedha.\"\u00b3\n\nA coin of similar type, which seems to have been struck by Kum\u0101ra Gupta, is in the cabinet of Sir A. Cunningham (Pl. III. 5).\n\nI do not know the meaning of the standard in front of the horse. Possibly it may be intended for the standard of Indra.\u2074\n\nThe Tiger type of Samudra Gupta's coinage is known from a single coin only, which possesses considerable artistic merit. The king is shown armed with a bow, and trampling\n\n\u00b9 Corpus Inscrip. Ind. vol. iii. pp. 3, 4.\n\u00b2 Not 'Se,' as formerly read. It also occurs on a late Indo-Seythian coin from the Panjab in A. C. cabinet (Ind. Ant. vol. xiv. p. 94).\n\u00b3 Ibid., pp. 44, and 27, 28. I erroneously supposed formerly that the passage in the Bilsar inscription referred to Kum\u0101ra Gupta.\n\u2074 According to Mr. J. F. Hewitt, Indra \"appears to be the special god of the warrior tribes, as opposed to the Brahmins\" (J.R.A.S. Vol. XX. n.s. p. 335).\non a tiger which he is shooting in the mouth. The Combatant Lion and Lion Trampler types of Chandra Gupta II. and Kum\u0101ra Gupta are very similar in design. The unique Retreating Lion coin of Chandra Gupta II. presents another variation of the same conception, and is the most artistic piece in the Gupta coinage. It is possible that these lion and tiger obverses may have been suggested by Greek representations of Herakles contending with the Nemean lion, but I am not able to show any clear connection between the Greek and Indian designs. The Retreating Lion coin certainly has a Greek look, and I am persuaded that its spirited design was inspired by Western models.\n\nThe late coins of Prak\u00e2s\u00e2ditya show a horseman attacking a lion or tiger, but the execution is degraded.\n\nThe goddess on the reverse of Samudra Gupta\u2019s Tiger type stands on a monster with an elephant\u2019s head and fish\u2019s tail. In mythology the fish-like dragon or makara is the vehicle of Varu\u1e47a, the god of the waters. The king\u2019s name Samudra means the ocean, and I think it almost certain that the obverse device idealizes Samudra Gupta as Varu\u1e47a, while the reverse represents the sea-god\u2019s consort.\u00b9 The All\u00e2h\u00e2b\u00e2d Pillar inscription compares Samudra Gupta with Dhanada or Kuvera, the god of wealth, Varu\u1e47a, the god of the waters, Indra, the god of the sky, and Antaka or Yama, the god of death.\n\nThe Battle-axe coins, which present Samudra Gupta as a warrior grasping a battle-axe and describe him as \u201carmed with the axe of K\u1e5bit\u0101nta\u201d or Yama, obviously are intended to express visibly the comparison with the god of death, which the inscription makes in words. The epithet \u201carmed with the axe of K\u1e5bit\u0101nta\u201d is also applied in the inscriptions to Samudra Gupta.\n\nThe king of the Standard type of K\u00e2cha appears to be unarmed. The standard which he supports bears a rayed emblem, which may symbolize the sun, and reappears on the Wheel variety of the Archer type of Chandra Gupta II. The\n\n\u00b9 Cf. the introduction of Demeter in the coins of Demetrius of Syria. Monsters like that on which the coin goddess stands are not uncommon in early Indian sculpture.\nstyle of the Standard coins closely approximates to that of the undoubted coins of Samudra, and I agree with Mr. Fleet in thinking it probable that K\u00e0cha was a title or second name of Samudra Gupta. These coins were formerly attributed erroneously to Gha\u1e6dotkacha, the second Mah\u00e2r\u00e2j\u00e2 of the Gupta Dynasty.\n\nThe Horseman types are confined to the reigns of Chandra Gupta II. and his son Kum\u00e2ra Gupta of the Imperial Dynasty, and the coins of both princes show the royal horseman turned both to left and right. He is sometimes armed with a bow. The Bactrian coinage offers many examples of equestrian portraits, which were probably the patterns imitated by the mint-masters of the Gupta Kings. The figure of a horseman also appears on the coins of the king who took the title of Prak\u00e2\u015b\u00e2ditya.\n\nChandra Gupta II., as depicted on his Umbrella gold coins, is armed with a sword, and shaded by an umbrella, carried by an attendant. The device of the Umbrella copper coins of the same reign is similar, but the execution is much ruder than that of the gold coins. The legend of the latter and the king\u2019s weapon connect them with the Swordsman coins of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta.\n\nThe peacock is the special emblem of the war-god Kum\u00e2ra (or K\u00e2rttikeya) and his consort Kum\u00e2ri Dev\u00ee, and is naturally prominent on the coins of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta. It is not, however, peculiar to his coinage. His gold coins of the Peacock type on the obverse depict the king offering fruit to a peacock, and on the reverse show the goddess Kum\u00e2ri Dev\u00ee riding on her sacred bird. The execution of some of these coins is very delicate, and the plate does not do them full justice. The goddess on the reverse of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta\u2019s Combatant Lion gold coins is standing feeding a peacock, and on the reverse of his Horseman coins is seated on a wicker stool, performing the same act. I presume that in\n\n---\n\n1 Cf. the mention of the later Kum\u00e2ra Gupta in l. 5 of the Apshar inscription of \u0100ditya Sena\u2014\u201cThat king begat one son, by name the illustrious Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, of renowned strength, a leader in battle; just as (the god) Har\u1e63a begat a son (K\u00e2rttikeya), who rides upon the peacock.\u201d\u2014Corpus Inscr. Ind. vol. iii. p. 206.\nall cases the goddess associated with the peacock is intended for Kum\u00e2r\u00ee Dev\u00ee.\n\nThe Fantail Peacock types of the silver coinage of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, Skanda Gupta, and Budha Gupta exhibit a peacock with expanded tail in the same attitude as on the variety \u03b2 coins of Kum\u00e2ra\u2019s gold Peacock type. An exact prototype of this design may be seen on the reverse of a coin of Julia Augusta, a daughter of Titus, who died between A.D. 81 and 90.\u00b9 Kum\u00e2ra Gupta flourished between the years A.D. 414 and 452, and the interval of time between him and Julia Augusta is very considerable. But the resemblance between his coins and hers is so great that I do not think it can be accidental. We know that Roman coins were familiar objects in India during the early centuries of the Christian era. A coin of Paulina (A.D. 217-228) is also very similar in its treatment of the peacock to the Gupta coins. Coins of Mariniana (circa A.D. 250) and of Manlia Scantilla Augusta (A.D. 193) may also be compared.\u00b2 I have no doubt that the Gupta representations of Kum\u00e2r\u00ee Dev\u00ee and the peacock are Hinduized adaptations of some or other of the devices of the Roman coins which bear representations of the peacock in association with the goddess Juno, or a deified lady of the imperial house.\n\nThe silver coins of Chandra Gupta II., Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, and Skanda Gupta, which I have classed as the Winged Peacock types, have a very ill-executed, and sometimes very obscure, reverse device, which has been variously interpreted as a peacock standing to front, as a goddess, and as an altar. This device, as seen on many specimens, is certainly intended as a rough diagram of a bird, and the bird is presumably a peacock. As shown on many coins of Skanda Gupta, the device is not in the least like a bird. But the history of coins offers so many examples of degradations of design that I am willing to believe, till some better explanation is found, that in all cases the obscure device in question is intended for a bird, that is to say, a peacock. This is the opinion of\n\n\u00b9 Tr\u00e9sor de Numismatique, Iconographie des Empereurs Romains, pl. xxii. 11.\n\u00b2 Ibid. plates xlviii. 4, 5; lii. 3; xli. 1.\nSir A. Cunningham, whose unrivalled knowledge of Hindu coins gives special weight to his judgment on a question of the sort. It is not, however, easy to understand why both correct and unrecognizable delineations of the same bird should be minted by one sovereign. The only available explanation is afforded by the fact that the coins with the well-drawn peacock appear to have been minted in Northern India, and that those with the unrecognizable device were the coinage of Guzer\u00e2t and K\u00e2thi\u00e2w\u00e2r.\n\nOn the Javelin gold coins of Samudra Gupta, the Swordsmau coins of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, and the Archer types of Samudra Gupta, Chandra Gupta II., Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, and Skanda Gupta, the king's arm is extended across a standard surmounted by a bird facing front.\n\nThe bird on the standard is necessarily designed on a very small scale, and shows no details, but, so far as it can be seen, it has a general resemblance to the bird-like creature on the reverse of the copper coins of Chandra Gupta II. and Kum\u00e2ra, and is not altogether unlike the object on the reverse of some of the Winged Peacock silver coins. The copper coins are rudely executed, and in the case of most of them it is hard to say what the creature on the reverse is intended for. The Hindu diecutters were very ready to make use of foreign designs and adapt them to the use of their own mythology. It is, therefore, quite possible that, as suggested by Professor Gardner, the reverse device of the copper coins may have been suggested by the owl of Ath\u00ean\u00e8 as seen on the coins of Pergamon. One specimen of the Umbrella type in the possession of Sir A. Cunningham (Pl. IV. 9) plainly delineates, in addition to the expanded wings, appendages which seem to be intended for human arms, and a few other specimens afford less distinct indications of the same intention. I do not think that the bird on the copper coins can be intended for a peacock, which it does not in the least resemble. Its head is drawn nearly circular, and was probably intended to represent a human face. For these reasons I now agree with Mr. Fleet in regarding the bird on\nthe copper coins as a representation of Garu\u1e0da, the monster, half-man, half-bird, on which Vishnu is believed to ride.\\(^1\\) But the device may have been suggested by Greek coins, and given a Hindu signification.\n\nIt is impossible to be quite certain what was meant by the bird on the standard of the gold coins, but the fact that the All\u00e2h\u00e2b\u00e2d Pillar inscription mentions \u2018Garu\u1e0da tokens\u2019 (Garutmatanka) or standards, renders it probable that the bird on the standard also was intended for Garu\u1e0da.\\(^2\\) I have no doubt that, whatever its meaning as a Hindu symbol, the form of the bird-standard was copied from the eagle of the Roman *aurei*, which were probably re-struck as Gupta *din\u0101rs*.\\(^3\\)\n\nThe goddess seated on a wicker stool and turned to the left is found, with variation in the accessories, on the Lyrist type of Samudra Gupta, and on the Horseman types, both Right and Left, of Chandra Gupta II. and Kum\u0101ra Gupta. Her attributes on the coins of Samudra Gupta and Chandra Gupta II. indicate that she is intended to represent a form of Lakshmi or Good Fortune; her association with the peacock on the coins of Kum\u0101ra Gupta suggests that she is there intended also as a representation of Kum\u0101ri Dev\u012b. The design itself is undoubtedly of foreign origin. The goddess of the Gupta coins seated on the wicker stool is almost an exact copy of Demeter as represented on a rare coin of the island of Paros in the British Museum, and the resemblance is so close that both designs must be referred to a common source.\n\nThe device of the Gupta coins may have been directly imitated from that of Apollo seated on the \u1f40\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, with its cover of the \u1f00\u03b3\u03c1\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd net, as seen on the Seleucid coins of Syria.\\(^4\\) Seleucid coins are sometimes found in India, and the devices of Apollo on the Syrian, and of Demeter on the Parian coins, are certainly connected with one another.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Ind. Ant. vol. xiv. p. 93.\n\n\\(^2\\) Corpus Inscr. Ind. vol. iii. p. 14, note 3.\n\n\\(^3\\) The word *din\u0101r* is used in Gupta inscriptions for a gold coin. The Garhw\u0101 (Gadhwa) inscription from the Allahabad district is remarkable for expressing certain endowments both in *din\u0101ras* and *suvarnas* (Corpus Inscr. Ind. vol. iii. p. 266, No. 64).\n\n\\(^4\\) Cf. the coins of Antiochus I. (J.A.S.B. vol. i. part i. p. 178, pl. xviii. 14, 15).\nThe standing king engaged in sacrificing at a small altar, who appears on the obverse of so many of the Gupta gold coins, is obviously an adaptation of the corresponding figure on many coins of Kanerki (Kanishka) and other Indo-Seythian princes. The altar is found on the Javelin coins of Samudra Gupta, the Archer type, variety \u03b2 of the same prince, the coins of K\u00e2cha, the Umbrella type of Chandra Gupta II., and the Swordsman type of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta. On later coins the king, instead of sacrificing at an altar, holds an arrow in his hand.\n\nThe reverse goddess of the gold coins, whether standing, or seated on a throne, or on an open lotus-flower, or on a lion, or on a wicker stool, is frequently represented as holding a cornucopiae. Mr. Theobald has devoted much pains to an attempt to prove that the object which I call a cornucopiae is really intended to represent a many-headed N\u00e2ga, or sacred snake.\u00b9 It is true that on some coins the symbol does recall to mind the polycephalic N\u00e2ga which is familiar in the sculptures of Amar\u00e2vat\u00ee and elsewhere, and it is possible, or even probable, that the Hindus who cut the Gupta dies were conscious that the symbol they engraved suggested the sacred snake.\n\nBut I think it is perfectly plain that the symbol in question was primarily a horn of plenty, copied from the Indo-Seythian coins, and, indirectly, either from the Syrian or Roman coins. The cornucopiae symbol appears for the last time on the rare coins forming Class I. of the Archer type of Chandra Gupta II., which were probably struck early in his reign, and must be dated about A.D. 400.\u00b2\n\nThe presence of the horn of plenty symbol shows that the goddess, whether sitting or standing, who holds it, is intended to be presented in a beneficent aspect. When she holds the cornucopiae and is seated on a lion, as in the case of the coins of Chandra Gupta I., it is obvious that the symbolism is intended to suggest both the terrible and the beneficent\n\n\u00b9 J.A.S.B. vol. liv. part i. pp. 84-92.\n\u00b2 In illustration of the fact that the cornucopiae was a foreign symbol I may mention that in M. Williams' English-Sanskrit Dictionary the word has to be rendered by a long periphrasis. No Sanskrit name for the symbol is adduced.\naspects of the goddess, and it is immaterial whether we call her P\u0101rvat\u012b, or Durg\u0101, or Lakshm\u012b, for she partakes of the special characteristics of each.\n\nThe goddess seated on a four-legged throne, who appears on the reverse of the Javelin and Archer types of Samudra Gupta, and the Couch and Class I. Archer types of the early part of the reign of Chandra Gupta II., is unmistakeably an adaptation of the goddess who is named AP\u0394OXPO, \u2018Ardochro,\u2019 on the Indo-Scythian coins. The coins of Class II. Archer type of Chandra Gupta II. introduce the reverse device of a goddess seated on an open lotus-flower, which remained for some centuries the standard design for the reverse of gold and copper coins in Northern India. This device seems not to have differed substantially from that of the throne-seated goddess in symbolical meaning, and the devices of the goddess standing, or seated on a wicker stool, unless when differentiated by special symbols, appear to have had the same general signification. These goddesses commonly, though not always, carry a lotus-flower in one hand, and a noose or fillet (p\u0101\u015ba) in the other. They agree in the main with the description of the goddess Sri or Lakshm\u012b, consort of Vish\u1e47u. \u201cShe is the goddess of good luck and plenty. . . She is worshipped by filling the corn-measure with wheat or other grain, and thereon placing flowers. She is represented as a lovely and benign woman, clothed in yellow, holding a lotus in her hand, and seated on a lotus, or beside Vish\u1e47u. Sometimes, as is likewise Vish\u1e47u, she is painted all yellow, and has four arms, and she holds in one of her right arms a rosary, and the p\u0101\u015ba or cord in one of her left. This cord is seen also in the hands of Varu\u1e47a and \u015aiva, and is emblematical of the sea, which girds the earth.\u201d\u00b9 In Sanskrit poetry Lakshm\u012b is described as ambuj\u0101sin\u0101, or seated on the lotus.\u00b2 The following description of her attributes by Sir Monier Williams will further elucidate the symbolism of the coins. \u201cLakshm\u012b\u2014the goddess of fortune or prosperity, wife of the god Vish\u1e47u.

Rapson for the quotation of this epithet.\nbeauty, and, in this respect, as well as in the story of her birth, agrees in character with Venus. She was born, according to the usual accounts, from the ocean, when churned by the gods and Asuras, and emerged from the foam of the sea, seated on a full-blown lotus, and holding a lotus in her hand. Her countenance is represented as incomparably beautiful. As presiding over abundance she resembles Ceres. . . .

She is an exact repetition of the sitting Demeter with cornucopi\u00e6 and ears of corn on the coins of Azes\u2014that is to say, of the sitting Demeter only. The standing Demeter also holds the cornucopi\u00e6, and is of course identical with the sitting form. This remark is by no means superfluous. The identity of the sitting and the standing Ardochro must be insisted on for the reason that it happens elsewhere in the case of these\n\n\u00b9 M. Williams, English-Sanskrit Dictionary, s.v. Lakshm\u00ee.\n\u00b2 Babylonian and Oriental Record, vol. ii. p. 43.\ncoins that the same name appears along with quite distinct figures. For instance, the name Athro is found on coins of king Ooerki along with the figure of Hephaistos, and on other coins of the Turushka kings along with that of a bearded warrior, who holds in his hand a sword, as well as a garland or diadem.\"\n\nThe noose or fillet (p\u0101\u015ba), so often seen in the right hand of the goddess on the reverse of the gold coins has been mentioned above as one of the common accessories of the representations of Lakshmi and other deities. This emblem on the Gupta coins is, as explained by Mr. Theobald, of ambiguous meaning. On the one hand, it is connected with the classic vitta or fillet, the emblem both of purity and power, and, on the other, with the Hindu noose symbol, which appears to have symbolized many things. As drawn on the Gupta gold coins the emblem is more of a noose than a fillet. It does not matter much which name is applied to it, and I shall continue to use the name fillet, subject to the foregoing remarks.\n\nThe gold coins, as has been shown, present a remarkable variety of obverse types. The silver coins, on the other hand, though readily distinguishable into groups by differences in their legends or reverse devices, have all substantially the same obverse device, namely, that of the king's head turned to the right, wearing a low cap or helmet. Many pieces exhibit a defective and corrupt legend in unintelligible Greek characters, which seem intended to stand for the PAO NANO PAO of the Indo-Scythian coinage. The Fan-tail Peacock coins of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, Skanda Gupta, and Budha Gupta are dated in the old Indian numerals, which were in use before the introduction of the present notation. On the coins of Toram\u00e2\u1e47a, who belonged to a different dynasty, and succeeded Budha Gupta in Western India, the king's head is turned to the left.\n\n1 Translated from p. 230 of Die Nachfolger Alexanders des Grossen in Baktrien und Indien, von Alfred von Sallet, Berlin, 1879.\n2 J.A.S.B. vol. liv. part i. p. 85.\n3 Cunningham, Arch. Rep. vol. ix. p. 26; and Fleet, Corpus Inscrip. Indic. vol. iii. p. 11. Both Chandra Gupta and Kum\u00e2ra Gupta indifferently turn their\nThe reverse devices of the silver coins have been enumerated above, and the derivation of the Fantail Peacock device has been explained. The obscure device, which I call the Winged Peacock, is barbarous in execution, and it is impossible to trace its origin more particularly. The Trident type connects the coins of Kum\u0101ra Gupta with those of the later Scuapati Bha\u1e6d\u0101rka of Valabhi, and the recumbent bull of the Bull type of Skanda Gupta's coinage was the special emblem of the kings of Valabhi, who succeeded the Guptas in Ka\u1e6dhi\u0101w\u0101r, and continued to use the same era. It is also found on the N\u0101ga coins of Narw\u0101r.\n\nThe obverse device and the general style of the Gupta silver coins are obviously copied from the coins of the Satraps of Saur\u0101shtra, whom the Gupta kings supplanted. The clusters of dots on some of the Gupta coins represent the rayed sun of the early Satrap coins.\n\nThe Satrap coins are imitations of Greek hemidrachm\u00e6, and bear a considerable resemblance to the coins of the Bactrian king Kodes.\n\nI have already referred to the Umbrella type of the copper coinage. The Standing King obverse device is also connected with the gold coinage. The bust of the king, with a flower in his right hand, of the Vikram\u0101ditya Bust type, is a rude imitation of well-known gold coins of Ooerki (Huvishka).\n\nThe reverse device of the copper coins has been explained above.\n\nChapter III.\u2014Monogrammatic Emblems.\n\nThe so-called monograms occur on the reverse of the Gupta gold coins, in the left field, over the right shoulder of the goddess.\n\nHorseman devices right and left.

The reference is to Mr. Newton's paper 'On the S\u0101h, Gupta, and other Ancient Dynasties of Katt\u012baw\u0101r and Guzerat,' which gives a very careful account of the Satrap coins, with a plate. The Satraps used erroneously to be called the S\u0101h Dynasty, owing to a misreading of the cognomen Sinha. See also Mr. Newton's paper 'On Recent Additions to our Knowledge of the Ancient Dynasties of Western India,' in Bo.J.R.A.S. vol. ix. p. 1 (1868).\nI have observed only one certain instance where a monogram is found on both obverse and reverse, namely, a coin of the Javelin type of Samudra Gupta, No. 688 of the Bodleian collection, which has monogram 6a on the reverse, and a variety of monogram 19 on the obverse. The obverse emblem looks as if it had been twice struck.\n\nThe forms assumed by the monogrammatic emblems on the numerous gold coins which I have examined are shown in Plate V. The most common forms consist of a horizontal line, or two parallel horizontal lines, surmounted by either three or four dots or short prongs, and having a square or lozenge attached below by one corner.\n\nSometimes the square or lozenge is replaced by a cross, and sometimes by other devices, and occasionally the prongs or dots above the horizontal line are wanting. One form (No. 25), which I know only from a drawing, and for the accuracy of which I cannot answer, departs altogether from the standard pattern.\n\nExamination of the plate will show the large variety of minor modifications in detail which occur.\n\nThe following statement exhibits the monograms which have come under my observation, arranged according to reigns:\n\n| Reign                  | Monogram                  |\n|------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Chandra Gupta I.       | 3a; 4a; 4b; 5; 8d; 22b.   |\n| Samudra Gupta.         | 3a; 4b; 4c; 4d; 6a; 6b; 8a; 8b; 9; 11; 19a; 19c; 20a; 20b; 21; 22a; 22b. |\n| K\u00e2cha (?=Samudra Gupta.) | 1; 2a; 2b; 4a.            |\n| Chandra Gupta II.      | 3a; 3b; 3d; 4c; 4e; 7a; 7b; 8a; 8b; 10a; 10b; 10c; 12; 15; 16; 17a; 17b; 17c; 18; 19a; 19b; 19d; 19e; 20a; 21; 22; 23; 24. |\n| Kum\u00e2ra Gupta.          | 3b; 8a; 8b; 8c; 10c; 17c; 17d; 19b; 20a; 25. |\n| Skanda Gupta.          | 3a; 3b; 4c?; 8a.          |\n| Heavy coins of Chandra, etc. | 8a; 8e; 10a; 13; 14; 19a. |\nThe following types have no monogram:\n\nReign.  \nSamudra Gupta.  \n\u201e \u201e  \nChandra Gupta II.  \nKum\u00e2ra Gupta.  \n\u201e \u201e  \n\u201e \u201e\n\nType.  \nA\u015bwamedha.  \nTiger.  \nJavelin.  \nHorseman to Left.  \nPeacock.  \nA\u015bwamedha.\n\nIn the following types the monogram is sometimes present, and sometimes wanting:\n\nReign.  \nSamudra Gupta.  \nChandra Gupta II.  \n\u201e \u201e  \n\u201e \u201e  \nKum\u00e2ra Gupta.  \n\nType.  \nLyrist.  \nHorseman to Right.  \nHorseman to Left.  \nLion-Trampler.  \nUmbrella.  \nHorseman to Right.\u00b9\n\nMonogrammatic emblems do not occur either on the silver or copper coins.\u00b2\n\nThe foregoing lists teach us that the monogram, though usually inserted, was frequently omitted, and was not considered indispensable.\n\nThe so-called monograms on the Gupta coins correspond to the similar emblems on the Indo-Scythian coinage, and whatever explanation applies to those of the one series necessarily applies to those of the other.\n\nThe general type of the Indo-Scythian and Gupta monograms is one, but the details vary, and I doubt if a single example of the Indo-Scythian series is exactly reproduced on a Gupta coin. A comparison of Wilson\u2019s plate of the Indo-Scythian monograms in the Ariana Antiqua with my Plate of the corresponding Gupta emblems will prove the correctness of this assertion.\n\n\u00b9 The above lists differ considerably from those given in J.A.S.B. vol. liii. part i. pp. 137, 138, subsequent discoveries and observations having rendered correction necessary.\n\n\u00b2 A mark like an iota occurs commonly on the coins of the Satraps of Saur\u0101shtra before the date, and occasionally on the Gupta silver coins, which Mr. Newton supposed to be a mint-mark.\nReal monograms, combinations of letters, usually Greek, occur on the field of the Gr\u00e6co-Bactrian coinage, some of which are certainly the names or initials of mint-cities. The analogy of the Bactrian coins has led to the application of the name monogram to the corresponding marks on the Indo-Scythian and Gupta mintage, but, strictly speaking, the name is not applicable in either case. The so-called Indo-Scythian and Gupta monograms are not combinations of letters of any alphabet. They have sometimes been called emblems, but that word is inconveniently vague, and the term monogrammatic emblem is cumbrous. I therefore use the name monogram as a convenient abbreviation, and hope that this explanation will prevent any misunderstanding of my meaning.\n\nIn my essay on the gold coins I expressed a hope that the precise significance of the Gupta monograms might be elucidated, but so far this hope has not been realized. They are certainly not the marks of individual mint-masters or other functionaries, because the same monogram runs on from reign to reign through a period exceeding a century in duration.\n\nWith equal certainty it may be affirmed that they are not blundered copies of the Indo-Scythian monograms. The Gupta coins, though closely related to the Indo-Scythian mintage, are not in any respect blind imitations of them, and are characterized by much originality of design, nor are the Gupta monograms inferior in mechanical execution to the Indo-Scythian, from which they differ with systematic, and obviously intentional, variety. The Gupta and Indo-Scythian die-cutters certainly meant to express substantially the same ideas by their monograms, but one did not copy from the other.\n\nI am convinced that the Gupta monograms do not indicate the mint-cities. The Indo-Scythian dominion in India began in, and spread from the Panj\u00e2b, and continued to exist there at least as late as the time of Samudra Gupta. There is no reason to suppose that the Guptas ever held the Panj\u00e2b, in which province none of their remains are found. Yet, as\nI have observed, the general similarity between the Indo-Scythian and Gupta monograms is obvious, and it is incredible that marks so nearly alike should be used to indicate Indo-Scythian mints in the Panj\u00e2b, and also mints in Bih\u00e2r and the adjoining provinces, where the Gupta gold coins appear to have been struck.\n\nWe find further that Gupta coins found together in a single hoard, and therefore presumably minted in one province, exhibit many monograms. Thirty-two coins of the Bharsar hoard present five monograms among twenty-five coins, and seven pieces had no monogram at all. Other hoards which I have examined present the same phenomenon.\n\nThe description of Types and Devices in the preceding chapter will have satisfied the reader that mythological symbolism is characteristic of the Gupta coins, as it is of the Indo-Scythian, and all ancient coinages. The presumption therefore is that the monograms are in harmony with the rest of the design, and have a religious or mythological significance, and I am convinced that, in general terms, this explanation of their meaning is the correct one.\n\nBut I cannot profess to explain them in detail. In my former publication I noted the curiously close likeness between monogram $6a$, and the Egyptian symbol for the bee, which is said to have been the sign royal in the Hieratic character, and observed that a trident, which bears a resemblance to some of the Indo-Scythian and Gupta monograms, occurs, detached like them, in the field of a coin of Rhescuporis II., King of the Bosporos (A.D. 17 to 34). The four-pronged symbol in the hand of Victory on some coins of Azes is identical with the upper part of many of the Indo-Scythian and Gupta monograms.\\(^1\\) I attach no importance to these observations, and repeat them merely on the chance that they may suggest a clue to a detailed interpretation.\n\nSubsequent investigation has enabled me to contribute little more to the elucidation of the problem, but I have noticed that certain marks called by Mr. Thomas \"harrows\" and \"trees,\" which occur on some of the early punch-\n\n\\(^1\\) Gardner, Greek and Scythic Kings of Bactria and India, pl. xviii. 11.\nmarked Indian coins of uncertain date, bear a general resemblance to the pronged forms of the Indo-Scythian and Gupta monograms.\\(^1\\) I think it is not unlikely that these pronged forms are connected with the familiar trident or *trishul* emblem, which was used as a symbol by different religions in many different senses, and that they are thus connected with symbols of almost world-wide use. At present I am unable to make any further suggestion, and can only renew the expression of the hope that the puzzle of the Indo-Scythian and Gupta \"monograms\" will eventually be solved.\n\n**Chapter IV.\u2014Legends.**\n\nIn order to present a detailed account of the palaeography of the Gupta coins it would be necessary to give a plate of alphabets, which would be costly and troublesome to prepare, and would scarcely repay the trouble.\\(^2\\) It may, however, be worth while to note, in an unsystematic way, a few peculiarities in the forms of the alphabet which occur in the coin legends, and to examine briefly the legends themselves.\n\nThe most remarkable peculiarity in the forms of characters used is the omission of the upper vowel marks in the Western series of silver coins. The Northern issues of the silver coinage with the reverse device of a peacock with expanded tail bear legends with the vowel marks above the line fully indicated. This distinction was first noted by Mr. Flect, and my examination of the coins fully confirms its existence. Plate IV. Fig. 2 shows that the omission of the vowel marks in the Western series was intentional, and not due to want of room on the coin. The coin there figured retains the dotted circle outside the legend, but the vowel marks are wanting, just as they are in coins where the legend is close to the margin. The practice of omitting the vowel marks also\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) J.A S.B. vol. xxxiv. part i. pl. xi. nos. 10 and 14. The same plate was also published in *Numism.

The vowel marks are omitted in the legends of a few of the gold coins, but, as a rule, they are inserted.\n\nThe form of the letter \\( m \\) presents remarkable variations. Coins of Samudra Gupta frequently present on the same piece this letter both in a slightly modified form of the character in the A\u015boka alphabet (No. 1), and in the square form with an indentation in the left limb, which is most common in the Gupta inscriptions (No. 2). The letter also frequently takes the form of two lines meeting in a point resting on a horizontal line (No. 3). A silver coin of Skanda Gupta in the British Museum twice renders medial \\( m \\) by three dots, arranged in a triangle with the apex at the bottom (No. 5), and another silver coin of the same king renders medial \\( m \\) by a single dot (No. 6). On a gold coin of Samudra Gupta in the Bodleian cabinet \\( m \\) assumes a square form without any indentation (No. 4). The following are the principal forms of \\( m \\):\n\n(1) \\( X \\); (2) \\( \\Sigma \\); (3) \\( V \\); (4) \\( L \\); (5) \\( : : \\); (6) .\n\nThe \\( p, t, h, \\) and \\( y \\) also display considerable variations of form, and there is hardly any letter in the alphabet which does not vary perceptibly in shape.\n\nThe unique Standing King copper coin of Kum\u0101ra Gupta in the Bodleian collection is remarkable for expressing long \\( \u0101 \\) by a vertical stroke behind the \\( m \\), as in the modern alphabet (post, p. 143). All other coins which I have seen express this vowel, when it is expressed at all, by a mark above the line, generally turned towards the right.\n\nThe nasal in the word \u015ai\u1e41ha is always written as the guttural nasal, and not as anusv\u0101ra.\n\nThe \\( k \\) in Vikrama on the coins of Chandra Gupta II. is frequently doubled.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe characters for \\( cha \\) and \\( ndra \\) on the rare silver Vikram\u0101ditya coins of Chandra Gupta II. are so peculiar\n\n\\(^1\\) In inscriptions of the Gupta period \\( t \\) and \\( k \\), when followed by \\( r \\), are often doubled, e.g. the Asirgarh seal of Sarvarman (Corpus Inscr.

Bayley, but the right reading is undoubtedly Chandra.\n\nOn some silver coins of Skanda Gupta the \\( k \\) in the conjunct character \\( ska \\) is rendered by a loop, which looks like a \\( v \\).\n\nThe letters forming the king's name in the field on the obverse of the gold coins are arranged vertically, and must be read from top to bottom. The arrangement of the letters of the name Kum\u00e2ra Gupta on the unique Two Queens coin is most peculiar. The letters lie on their side, but the word Kum\u00e2ra, on the right of the central figure, is to be read from above, and the word Gupta, on the left, from below (Plate III. 4).\n\nThe legends on the silver coins of Skanda Kram\u00e2ditya are extremely rude and irregular.\n\nThe legends of the Gupta coins consist of the kings' names with the addition of various boastful titles or epithets and laudatory phrases. The queen's name is also recorded on one type, and will probably be found on one or two other types when better specimens than those now available come to light.\n\nChandra Gupta I. in the single known type of his coinage contented himself with the record of his own and his consort's names, and the addition of the word 'Liehehhavayah' (the Liehehhavis), intimating that his queen belonged to the Liehehhavi royal family of Nep\u00e2l. It is evident that he was very proud of this alliance. He abstains from the use of bragging phrases.\n\nHis successor, Samudra Gupta, was fond of titles, and of vaunting his conquests, prowess, and accomplishments. We know his coinage in gold only. I presume that his Tiger type, preserved in a single specimen, was his earliest coinage, because he there assumes the plain title of R\u00e2j\u00e2 only. On the obverse he describes himself as ry\u00e2ghra par\u00e2krama (? or vikrama), 'equal in might to the tiger,' and on the reverse simply as R\u00e2j\u00e2 Samudra Gupta. Possibly the coins of this type may have been struck during his father's lifetime. The Tiger, A\u015bwamedha, and Lyrist types of Samudra are connected by the circumstance that all three look more like\nmedals than ordinary coins. The Tiger and A\u015bwamedha coins agree in having standing goddesses on the reverse, and the Lyrist and A\u015bwamedha types are related by their common possession of the mysterious syllable \u2018Si\u2019 in a detached position in the exergue.\n\nSamudra Gupta had a special liking for the word par\u0101krama, \u2018power\u2019 or \u2018might.\u2019 The obverse legend of the A\u015bwamedha pieces is imperfect, but contains a boast of having conquered the earth (pr\u012bthivi); the reverse records the fact that the king had power to celebrate the horse sacrifice (A\u015bicamedha par\u0101krama).\n\nThe Lyrist type on the reverse simply gives the king\u2019s name, which is repeated on the obverse with the addition of the prefix \u015ar\u012b, and the sovereign title of Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101dhir\u0101j\u0101.\n\nThe Javelin type on the obverse has a long legend stating that \u201chis majesty (deva), having conquered [the earth], and being victor in a hundred battles of various kinds, is victorious.\u201d The reverse bears the word par\u0101krama, \u2018might\u2019 or \u2018prowess,\u2019 alone.\n\nOne variety of Samudra\u2019s Archer type repeats par\u0101krama as the sole reverse legend, the other substitutes the epithet apratiratha, \u2018invincible in his war-chariot,\u2019 which is also used in the inscriptions to characterize Samudra Gupta. The obverse legend seems to be of the same purport as that of the Javelin type, the synonym k\u1e63iti being substituted for pr\u012bthivi, \u2018earth.\u2019\n\nThe legends of the Battle-axe type explain the symbolism of the devices, and compare the king to Yama, god of Death and Judgment, under his name of K\u1e5bit\u0101nta, \u2018he that maketh an end.\u2019 The obverse also gives the king the title of R\u0101j\u0101dhir\u0101j\u0101, and not the higher title of Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101dhir\u0101j\u0101 which is used on the Lyrist coin.\n\nThe style and reverse device plainly connect the coins of K\u0101cha with the Tiger and A\u015bwamedha types of Samudra Gupta, of whom K\u0101cha was probably a title. These coins bear the remarkable legend K\u0101cho g\u0101m avajitya karmabhir uttamair jayati, \u2018K\u0101cho, having vanquished the earth, by excellent deeds is victorious,\u2019 and the king is called \u2018the\nexterminator of all r\u0101j\u0101s,' an epithet applied in four, or perhaps five, inscriptions to Samudra Gupta.\\footnote{Corpus. Inscr. Ind. vol. iii. p. 27, note 4.}\n\nThe correct sandhi, or euphonic change of vowels and consonants, in this legend and the legends of some other northern Gupta coins is noticeable.\n\nThe epithet deva, 'divine,' which Mr. Fleet renders by 'his majesty,' first appears on Samudra's Javelin pieces. It reappears on the unique Couch coin of Chandra Gupta II., and on several later issues, both gold and silver.\n\nChandra Gupta II. affected the use of the word vikrama, instead of the synonymous par\u0101krama, which Samudra Gupta preferred, and sometimes used the compound epithets vikram\u0101ditya 'sun of power,' and vikram\u0101nka 'arm of power.' The latter epithet occurs on the silver coins only. The title vikram\u0101ditya is found on the gold, silver, and copper coins of Chandra Gupta II.\n\nOrdinarily the personal title used by one Gupta king is not used by another, but the title Vikram\u0101ditya is undoubtedly used on ten rude silver coins in the British Museum which bear the name of Skanda Gupta.\n\nThe special appellation of Skanda Gupta was Kram\u0101ditya, a synonym of Vikram\u0101ditya, which occurs on both the Winged Peacock (Altar) and Bull types of his silver coinage, and on his heavy gold coins of the suvar\u1e47a standard. The gold coins of Kum\u0101ra with the title of Kram\u0101ditya (Arch. Rep. vol. xvi. p. 81) appear to belong to the later Kum\u0101ra Gupta of Magadha. The title is also found on the Bull coins recently discovered by Mr. Rivett-Carnac (Pl. III. 12).\n\nThe three Lion types (Lion-Trampler, Combatant Lion, and Retreating Lion) of Chandra Gupta II. may be regarded as imitations of the Tiger type of Samudra Gupta, and bear a reverse legend in the same form; the words si\u1e41ha vikrama, 'with the strength of a lion,' being substituted for vy\u0101ghra par\u0101krama, 'with the might of a tiger.'\n\nIn his Umbrella type of gold coins, Chandra Gupta II. uses the formula Vikram\u0101ditya kshitim avajitya sucharati, 'Vikram\u0101ditya having conquered the earth prospers,' and\nthe same formula, with the substitution of the synonym g\u00e1m for kshitim, is used by Kum\u00e2ra Gupta in his Swordsmen type.\n\nThe special personal title of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta was Mahendra, which has not been found on the coins of any other member of the dynasty. It occurs uncompounded only on Kum\u00e2ra's gold coins. He uses it in combination with the participle ajita 'unconquered,' in his Horseman types, with Sri in his Archer type, with Kum\u00e2ra in his Peacock type, and with Sinha in his Lion types (Combatant Lion and Lion-Trampler). A coin of the Combatant Lion type adds the word par\u00e2krama, which generally occurs on the coins of Samudra Gupta only. The fuller compounded form Mahendraditya is found on the Winged Peacock and Trident silver coins of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta.\n\nA Horseman to Left coin in the Bodleian cabinet gives Kum\u00e2ra the title Kramajita, 'of unconquered power,' which has not been found elsewhere, and his unique Two Queens coin presents the title Sri Pratapa.\n\nThe epithet parama bh\u00e2gavata, 'most devout worshipper of the holy one,' scilicet Vishnu, is first met with on the coins of Chandra Gupta II., who uses it on his Vikramaditya silver coins, and his Horseman to Right and Horseman to Left gold pieces. The same epithet is used on the Winged Peacock silver coins of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta and Skanda Gupta, and on the Bull silver coins of the latter prince.\n\nThe formula vijit\u00e2vanir avanipati, 'lord of the earth, who has conquered the earth,' is found on the Fantail Peacock coins of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, Skanda Gupta, Budha Gupta, Toram\u00e2na, Bh\u00eema Sena, and \u00ces\u00e2na Varman, and is said by Thomas to occur on an unpublished gold Archer coin of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta in the Freeling collection.\n\nThe legends of the Horseman (Right and Left) gold coins of Kum\u00e2ra are unfortunately imperfect, but they seem to give him the title of kshitipati, a synonym of avanipati, 'lord of the earth.'\n\nI read the title of mah\u00e2kshatrapa 'great Satrap' on a silver coin of Skanda Gupta in the British Museum, and believe the reading to be correct, but it requires confirmation.\nThe obverse legend of two Lion-Trampler gold coins of Kum\u0101ra Gupta clearly appears to include the words \u015ar\u012b Siksha (or Saiksha) devata, but I cannot interpret them.\n\nNara, a successor of the Guptas in their Eastern dominions, took the title of B\u0101l\u0101ditya, 'the young' or 'rising sun.' The proper personal name of the king who assumed the title of Prak\u0101\u015baditya, 'sun of splendour,' has not yet been deciphered.\n\nChapter V.\u2014Weights.\n\nSince the publication of my essay on the Gupta gold coins in 1884 I have seen a large number of coins not previously known to me, and have learned the weights of many, but the statistics collected five years ago remain still substantially correct. It seems, therefore, unnecessary to repeat in detail all the arguments then used to establish my positions. I shall content myself with a brief recapitulation of what is already on record, and with noting the few new facts available, and the modifications in my views which they suggest. Most of the Gupta gold coins follow the Indo-Scythian standard, which was apparently adopted from the Romans. We know from Pliny, whose Natural History was published in or about A.D. 77, that a great stream of Roman gold poured into India in his time, and the numerous finds of Roman coins in India prove that it continued for long after.\n\nThe aureus of Julius Caesar in the specimens now existing ranges in weight from 120 to 125 grains. His standard is supposed to have been 125\u00b766 grains. He was murdered B.C. 44. After his death the weight of the Roman aureus gradually declined, and is said to have averaged 115\u00b739 grains in the reign of Nero (A.D. 54-68). Professor Gardner gives 114 grains as the highest known weight of Nero's aurei. The average weight of the aurei of Augustus in the British Museum is 121\u00b726 grains.\n\nThe reasonings in my previous publication were based on the weighment of 177 gold Gupta coins. Subsequent discoveries do not materially alter the facts, and I therefore\nallow the figures to stand as before, with few exceptions. The highest weights are as follows:\n\n| Reign                  | Type                        | Grains |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------|--------|\n| Chandra Gupta I.       | King and Queen              | 123\u00b78  |\n| Samudra Gupta          | All                         | 123\u00b74  |\n| K\u00e2eha (?=Samudra Gupta)| Standard                    | 125\u00b78  |\n| Chandra Gupta II.      | Archer, wheel variety       | 132\u00b75  |\n|                        | Horseman to Right           | 130\u00b792 |\n|                        | Archer, common variety      | 127\u00b76  |\n|                        | Others                      | 124\u00b70  |\n| Kum\u00e2ra Gupta           | All                         | 128\u00b76  |\n| Skanda Gupta           | Archer                      | 132\u00b75  |\n| Heavy coins of Chandra, etc. | All                     | 148\u00b77  |\n\nI think that I formerly attached too much importance to average or mean weights. The really significant weighments are those of the best-preserved specimens, and I now confine my consideration to these.\n\nMy published table of weights gives as the highest weight of the Horseman to Right (Lancer) coins of Chandra Gupta II. 119\u00b77 grains. A subsequently discovered coin of this type weighs 130\u00b792 grains, and is thus made to conform in standard to the comparatively heavy Wheel variety of the Archer type of the same king, the heaviest specimen of which weighs 132\u00b75 grains. I formerly supposed that the Horseman to Right (Lancer) coins were referable to a standard of 125, and the Wheel coins to a standard of 136\u00b74 grains. Now it would seem as if this distinction were not sustainable, and I suspect that in my former paper I made too little allowance for wear and tear. The coins of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta weigh, on the average, higher than those of his predecessors, but the top weight of any one coin of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta\u2019s is only 128\u00b76. Skanda Gupta\u2019s heaviest coin of the Archer type (not Kram\u00e2ditya) weighs 132\u00b75 grains, the same as the heaviest of the Wheel coins of Chandra Gupta II. I am inclined now to regard all these coins as struck according to a single standard, which seems to have been that of the Attic stater of 134\u00b74 grains, transmitted through Roman, or possibly Syrian, channels.\nI adhere to the opinion that the best-established value for the *rati*, the fundamental weight of the Indian scale, is 1\u00b7823 grain, which, for convenience, may be read as 1\u00b7825 grain, and that, consequently, the weight of the *suvarga* gold coin of 80 *rat\u012bs* ought to be 146 grains.\n\nI think there can be no doubt that the heavy coins bearing the names of Chandra, Kum\u0101ra, Skanda Kram\u0101ditya, Nara B\u0101l\u0101ditya, and Prak\u0101s\u0101ditya were intended to be of a standard different from that of the ordinary Gupta gold coins. The mean weight of these heavy coins is always, roughly speaking, about 20 grains greater than that of the regular Gupta coinage, and it is impossible that so great and constant a difference can be accidental.\n\nThe British Museum contains eleven pieces in base metal which bear the name of Kum\u0101ra, or its initial syllable, and the heaviest of these coins weighs as much as 151 grains. No safe conclusion as to weight standards can be drawn from coins of utterly base metal, and these debased coins of Kum\u0101ra must be excluded from consideration. They are certainly of later date than the death of Skanda Gupta, and probably belong to the later Kum\u0101ra Gupta of Magadha (*circa* A.D. 550), but no information as to their find-spots is available, and I cannot feel any certainty respecting their attribution.\n\nThe heavy coins of Chandra, which have been placed in the scales, weigh 144\u00b75 and 148 grains, and bear the title Vikram\u0101ditya. The metal in these pieces does not apparently differ from the much-alloyed gold of many of the ordinary Archer coins of Chandra Gupta II., which ordinarily weigh about 123 grains. I know of no Chandra except Chandra Gupta II., to whom these heavy coins can be referred, and am now inclined to the opinion that they were struck during his reign, and formed a provincial coinage, probably issued from an Eastern mint.\n\nThe heavy Kum\u0101ra coins of tolerably good gold, four specimens of which are in the British Museum, weigh up to 148\u00b77 grains. I cannot be certain whether they are a provincial issue of Kum\u0101ra Gupta of the Early Gupta dynasty, or were issued by the later Kum\u0101ra Gupta of Magadha.\nI know of no Skanda except the Early Gupta king, and now believe that the heavy gold coins of Skanda with the title Kram\u00e2ditya were issued by Skanda Gupta of the Early Gupta dynasty. The metal seems to be of much the same quality as that of his undoubted coins. The heavy coins of Skanda Kram\u00e2ditya which have been weighed weigh from 141\u00b74 to 146 grains.\n\nThe coins of Nara B\u00e2l\u00e2ditya and Prak\u00e2\u015b\u00e2ditya are certainly later than the time of Skanda Gupta, and were not issued by members of the Early Gupta dynasty. Many of the coins of Nara are of base metal. The heaviest of tolerably good gold weighs 146\u00b75 grains. The heaviest Prak\u00e2\u015b\u00e2ditya coin weighs 146\u00b72 grains.\n\nIt is, as I have said, useless to attempt to argue about the weights of coins struck in utterly base metal, but the heavy coins of Skanda Kram\u00e2ditya, and some of those bearing the names of Chandra, Kum\u00e2ra, Nara B\u00e2l\u00e2ditya, and Prak\u00e2\u015b\u00e2ditya are not obviously inferior in quality of metal to the undoubted coins of Chandra Gupta II., and it seems incredible that it should have been intended that these heavy coins, averaging about 144 grains, should have been struck, like the earlier Gupta coinage, to the standard of 134\u00b74 grains. I still think that the intention was to adjust them to the Hindu surarna standard of 146 grains. We cannot at present explain why this standard was adopted for some coins, and not for others, but I think it clear that both standards were in simultaneous use. The Garhw\u00e2 (Gadhw\u00e2) inscription from the All\u00e2h\u00e2b\u00e2d District, which seems to have been recorded in the reign of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, especially mentions an endowment of nineteen surarnas, and the same inscription makes mention of din\u00e2ras. The name surarnas would properly be applied to the heavy class, and that of din\u00e2ra to the lighter class of Gupta coins. Unluckily this inscription is imperfect. (See Corpus Inscr. Ind. vol. iii. p. 264, No. 64.) Endowments of din\u00e2ras are mentioned in other Gupta inscriptions, e.g. in the S\u00e2nchi record dated 131 (ibid, p. 260, No. 62).\n\nSpecimens of the Gupta silver coins of Kum\u00e2ra and Skanda\nare so numerous that it would be absurd to give their weights in detail. The silver pieces of Chandra Gupta II., however, are extremely rare. The Freeling specimen of his Vikram\u0101nka type weighed 31 grains, and this is the only coin of his reign the weight of which I know. Specimens of the Winged Peacock type of Kum\u0101ra Gupta range in weight as high as 33 grains, or a fraction more, but average about 29. The Fantail Peacock coins of the same king are of about the same weight. Mr. Thomas observes that the weight of the Winged Peacock coins of Skanda Gupta \"is more than ordinarily uneven, rising from $22\\frac{1}{2}$ to 33 grains.\" The highest weight noted for Skanda Gupta's Fantail Peacock coins is about 35 grains, and for his Bull type is 30 grains.\n\nI am not able to give analyses of the metal in the silver coinage, but it is, like that of the gold coins, frequently impure. The figures given are, however, sufficient to show that all the Gupta silver coins were intended to be roughly equivalent to Attic hemidrachm\u00e6, though they depart considerably from the standard weight.\n\nThe copper coins are rare, as compared with the silver, and it is possible to deal with their weights in more detail, but the coins are almost all in such bad condition that the investigation is not very profitable, and I cannot make out with certainty the standard according to which they were struck.\n\nA much worn coin of the Umbrella type of Chandra Gupta II. weighs 102 grains, and another only 70\u00b78. They may be intended for three-quarter pana pieces, of which the standard weight would be 109\u00b75 grains.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe Standing King coins range from 13\u00b75 to 53\u00b75 grains, and evidently include at least two denominations, but the specimens are all so worn, and the weights are so graduated, that I cannot say with confidence what the denominations were.\n\nThe British Museum specimens of the Vikram\u0101ditya Bust\n\n\\(^1\\) The pana in copper was the same weight as the suvar\u1e47a in gold, and the equivalent in value of 60 cowrie shells, or a handful (Arch. Rep. vol. x. p. 78; vol. xiv. p. 17).\ntype weigh respectively 44 and 40\u00b75 grains. Both these coins are in fair condition. I do not think the full weight can have exceeded 50 grains.\n\nThe Chandra Head coins are all small, and some are excessively minute. The lowest weight is 6\u00b75 (or perhaps 4\u00b75), and the highest 28 grains. I have sorted the coins into a larger size weighing from 16\u00b75 to 28 grains, and a smaller size weighing from 6\u00b75 (or perhaps 4\u00b75) to 13 grains. I am inclined to think that three denominations of this type were issued, but the bad condition of the coins forbids any definite conclusions.\n\nThe little piece which weighs only 4\u00b75 grains is very indistinct, and may belong to the Vase type of Chandra.\n\nThese curious little Vase coins occur in at least two sizes. A specimen of the larger kind weighs 13 grains, and the minute pieces range from 3\u00bd to 7 grains. I do not think that these coins were issued by a member of the Gupta dynasty.\n\nThe metal of the Gupta copper coins seems to be of good quality.\n\nMost of the gold coins are in weight aurei (= didrachm\u00e6) of the standard of 134\u00b74 grains, but some, as I have said, seem to have been struck to the Hindu standard of 146 grains. The genuine copper coinage, which was struck at Northern mints, is obviously related to the gold, and was doubtless intended to follow either the Gr\u00e6co-Roman or the Hindu standard, but I am unable to decide which was actually followed.\n\nThe minute copper coins of Skanda Gupta and Kum\u00e2ra Gupta which follow the types of the silver coinage seem to be ancient forgeries.\u00b9 They have been found in Ka\u1e6dhi\u0101w\u0101r.\n\nChapter VI.\u2014Find-Spots and Mints.\n\nIn my former publication I gave minute details of the provenance of all the Gupta gold coins mentioned in my Catalogue, so far as known. It appears unnecessary to repeat\n\n\u00b9 See post, Chapter X. Supplement to Catalogue of Copper Coins, p. 144.\nall those details, and I shall now confine myself to a general summary of the facts, adding details of the hoards of gold coins which have been discovered of late years, and a brief account of the provenance of the silver and copper coins.\n\nThe newly-discovered hoards of gold coins are as follows:\n\n(1). The T\u00e2nd\u00e2 hoard.\n\nT\u00e2nd\u00e2 is an old site in the Rai Bareli District of Oudh. The hoard was discovered in 1885, and consisted of twenty-five coins. Two of these belonged to the King and Queen type of Chandra Gupta I. The remaining twenty-three consisted of coins of K\u00e2cha, and specimens of the \u00c1\u015bwamedha and Battle-axe types of Samudra Gupta, but, unfortunately, I omitted to note the exact numbers of each class. Specimens from this hoard are now in the Lucknow Museum, and seven coins belonging to it have been briefly noticed in print.\u00b9\n\n(2). The Ko\u1e6dw\u00e2 hoard.\n\nThis hoard was found at an ancient site named Ko\u1e6dw\u00e2 in the B\u00e2nsgaon Tahsil of the Gorakhpur District in the N.W.P., and a detailed description of it has been published by me.\u00b2 Its contents were remarkably varied, as follows:\u2014\n\n| Chandra Gupta II. | Archer type, class II., variety \\( \\alpha \\), 5 specimens. |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n|                   | Lion-Trampler type, variety \\( \\delta \\), 1 specimen.   |\n| Kum\u00e2ra Gupta.     | Archer type, class I., variety \\( \\eta \\), 1 specimen.  |\n|                   | Horseman to Right type, variety \\( \\alpha \\), 3 specimens. |\n|                   | Ditto, variety \\( \\gamma \\), 2 specimens.               |\n|                   | Horseman to Left type, 1 specimen.                      |\n|                   | Peacock type, variety \\( \\beta \\), 2 specimens.         |\n|                   | Lion-Trampler type, variety \\( \\alpha \\), 1 specimen.   |\n\n(3). The Bast\u00ee hoard.\n\nThis hoard was found, in August, 1887, at the site of an\n\n\u00b9 Proc. A.S.B. April, 1886, p. 68. Information respecting this hoard was first given me by Mr. F. Rose, of the P.W.D.\n\u00b2 Proc. A.S.B. July, 1887. I had not an opportunity of correcting the proofs of this paper, and regret that it is consequently disfigured by some misprints in the references.\nold town in Mauza Sarai, close to the Jail of the civil station of Bast\u00ee, in the Bast\u00ee District of the N.W.P., which was then in my charge. Bast\u00ee is forty miles west of Gorakhpur, and lies between that town and Ajodhya. Eleven coins appear to have been found, but I only succeeded in purchasing ten for Government. Nine of these belong to the common variety of the Archer type (class II. a) of Chandra Gupta II. The tenth is a specimen of the rare Umbrella type of the same king. This coin is, I think, now in the Lucknow Museum.\n\nMr. J. G. Sykes, Barrister-at-law, Lucknow, has favoured me with an inspection of nine Gupta gold coins in his cabinet, which were probably obtained in Oudh.\n\nMr. H. Rivett-Carnac has shown me sundry gold coins, obtained for the most part in or near Benares, which have passed through his hands, including fifteen specimens of the coinage of Skanda Kram\u00e2ditya.\n\nI understand that Mr. Hodges, of the P.W.D., has nineteen gold Gupta coins, all procured in Oudh, but I have not seen them.\n\nI am indebted to Sir A. Cunningham for the following note on the find-spots of Gupta coins, which I give verbatim.\n\n\"The finds of gold Guptas are often concealed. Most of my coins have been obtained at the great places of pilgrimage, Mathur\u00e2, Benares, and Gay\u00e2. The silver Gupta coins are chiefly found at Benares and country round about it, Ajudhya and country round about it, Mathur\u00e2, and places in the neighbourhood. A fair number of silver Guptas have been obtained round about Sah\u00e2ranpur and B\u00fbriya on the Jumna. The only records that I can find in my existing note-books are the following.\"\n\n1 Proc.

The exact number of coins is not known, but several of Mr. Hooper's specimens are from this find. This hoard was not explicitly mentioned in my former essay, though alluded to in the notes on Mr. Hooper's coins.\n\n\u00b9 Letter dated 27th January, 1888. Sankisa is in the Farrukh\u00e2b\u00e2d District, N.W.P.; Sult\u00e2nganj is in the Bh\u00e2galpur District, Bengal; Kosam is in the All\u00e2h\u00e2b\u00e2d District, N.W.P.; Ah\u00eechhatra (R\u00e2m\u00e2gar) is in the Barel\u00ee District, N.W.P.; and Sunit is in the L\u00fbdi\u00e2na District, Panj\u00e2b. The copper coin of Kum\u00e2ra, collected by Tregear, is in the Bodleian cabinet.\nThe statistics previously published by me proved that the total of indisputably gold coins found east of Kanauj was then known to be about 480, only five or six being known to have been obtained at Kanauj, and 10 to the west or north-west of that city. I therefore observed that \"the evidence now presented fully warrants the assertion that the find-spots of the Gupta gold coins in no way support the statement that Kanauj was the Gupta capital.\" The fresh evidence amply confirms this proposition. Two of the newly-discovered hoards, those of Ko\u1e6dw\u00e2 and Bast\u00ee, were found in the districts of the N.W.P. east of Oudh, and the third, that of T\u00e2nd\u00e2, was found in the province of Oudh, which is to the east of Kanauj.\u00b9 A few stray specimens of Gupta gold coins have been picked up in the western districts, or even in the Panj\u00e2b, but very few, except at certain places of pilgrimage, and the fact is certain that the study of the gold coinage indicates no special connection of the Gupta dynasty with Kanauj, and there is not the slightest reason to suppose that the Gupta gold coins were minted at that city.\n\nThe evidence as to the find-spots of the silver and copper coins supports the same negative proposition.\n\nThe principal locality from which the copper coins are obtained is the ancient Hiudu city of Ajodhy\u00e2 (Ayudhy\u00e2), near Faiz\u00e2b\u00e2d on the banks of the Gh\u00e2gra on the eastern border of Oudh. Ten out of fifteen specimens of the copper coinage in Sir A. Cunningham's cabinet were obtained at this place, from which Tregear also procured his unique specimen of the Standing King type of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta. The five copper coins in Mr. Hooper's cabinet were all collected at Ajodhya.\n\nAhichhatra (R\u00e2mnagar), in the Bareli District of the North-Western Provinces, far to the north-west, has yielded two copper coins of Chandra Gupta, and one, which is doubtfully ascribed to Kum\u00e2ra Gupta. Two copper pieces of\n\n\u00b9 Kanauj is in the Farrukh\u00e2b\u00e2d or Fatehgarh District of the North-Western Provinces. An account of its history and a description of the few remains now existing on its site will be found in Cunningham's Arch. Rep. vol. i. pp. 279 seqq.\nChandra Gupta have been obtained in the Panj\u00e2b, namely, one by Mr. Theobald at P\u00e2n\u00eepat, near Delhi, and the other by Sir A. Cunningham at Sunit, near L\u00fbdi\u00e2na. One has been procured at Kosam in the All\u00e2h\u00e2b\u00e2d District.\n\nIt is quite clear that the copper eoinage, like the gold, has no special connection with Kanauj. The copper coins of Chandra Gupta II. are not so rare as has sometimes been supposed. I know that many specimens exist in the cabinets of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the Lucknow Museum, and private collectors, respecting which I have not been able to procure details. My catalogue notices in detail more than fifty pieces, and I should say that at least as many more exist scattered in various collections. It is unfortunate that more copious information respecting the find-spots of the copper coins is not available, because copper coins are rarely dug up far from their place of mintage, and, if we knew the find-spots of the copper coins with accuracy, we should know the position of the Gupta copper mints.\n\nThe negative proposition, that the copper eoinage had no special connection with Kanauj, having been established, I think that the fact of sixteen Gupta copper coins having been obtained (and presumably found) at the ancient city of Ajodhya fully warrants the positive inference that a mint for copper coinage was maintained, certainly by Chandra Gupta II., and probably by Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, at that place. The remaining evidence concerning the provenance of the Gupta copper is too imperfect to justify any further positive conclusions, but it is not improbable that Ahichhatra also was a mint-city.\n\nThe Gupta copper coins are sometimes found associated with those of the Mitra (Sunga) dynasty, which are obtained in considerable numbers at Ajodhya and in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe silver Gupta coinage was provincial. It is, in all its forms, beyond doubt a continuation of the Satrap eoinage of Saur\u00e2shtra, which was imitated from Graeco-Bactrian hemidrachm\u00e6, and it can hardly be doubted that the form of the Satrap coinage was first adopted by Chandra Gupta II. when he conquered Saur\u00e2shtra and Guzerat. The Udayagiri\ninscription shows that he was in M\u00e2lw\u00e2 in the year 82 G.E., equivalent to A.D. 401-402, but the precise date of the western conquests is not known. Kum\u00e2ra Gupta and Skanda Gupta retained possession of these conquests, and issued large quantities of silver coinage, and, after the death of Skanda Gupta, his successor in the west, Budha Gupta, and likewise Toram\u00e2na and Bh\u00eema Sena, who succeeded Budha Gupta, continued to strike silver coins of the same general pattern.\n\nAs I have said, all the Gupta silver coins are intended to be roughly equivalent in weight to hemidrachm\u00e6, and all are clearly derived from the Satrap coins of Saur\u00e2shtra, the obverse device of which is continued throughout the series without material change. But the reverse devices of the Gupta silver coins divide the coinage into at least three distinct classes, which may be called the Winged Peacock, the Bull, and the Fantail Peacock. The main reverse device on the very rare silver coins of Chandra Gupta II. is a rude representation of a bird (presumably a peacock, but possibly intended for Garu\u1e0da) standing to front with wings expanded but the tail concealed. Excepting one specimen, which was found at Sult\u00e2nganj in the Bh\u00e2galpur District, Bengal, associated with a coin of Sw\u00e2m\u00ee Rudra S\u00eeiha, the last Satrap of Saur\u00e2shtra, all the silver coins of Chandra Gupta II. appear to have been found in Ka\u1e6dhi\u00e2w\u00e2r or Guzerat. I have no doubt that they were struck at some place or places in either of those provinces.\n\nKum\u00e2ra Gupta struck immense quantities of silver coins with the same reverse device, some bearing the title of R\u00e2j\u00e2dhir\u00e2j\u00e2, and some the higher title of Mah\u00e2r\u00e2j\u00e2dhir\u00e2j\u00e2. I believe specimens of these coins are occasionally found in Northern India, but all of which I know particulars were found in the same provinces as the coins of Chandra Gupta II., and were certainly struck at mints there situated.\n\n1 Cunningham, Arch. Rep. vol. x. pp. 49, 51; Corpus Inscrip. Ind. vol. iii.\n2 Cunningham, Arch. Rep. vol. ix. p. 26. The unique coin of Bh\u00eema Sena has been presented by Mr. H. Rivett-Carnac to the British Museum, which also possesses the only two known specimens of Toram\u00e2na's coinage.\n3 Now in the Indian Imperial Museum, Calcutta.\n4 Cunningham, Arch. Rep. vol. x. p. 127.\nSkanda Gupta struck coins bearing the title Kram\u00e2ditya, some of which have the reverse device the same as on the coins of Chandra Gupta II. and of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, while the majority bear a rude device which seems to be a modified form of it, but which has generally been described as an 'altar.' His silver coins bearing the title Vikram\u00e2ditya all have the degraded altar-like device. All these varieties of Skanda Gupta's silver coinage seem to have been issued from Western mints.\n\nA few coins of Skanda Gupta have as reverse device a recumbent bull, associated with the title Kram\u00e2ditya. I have no precise information as to the find-spots of these coins, but, considering that the recumbent bull was the cognizance of the Kings of Valabhi in Saur\u00e2shtra, I presume that they were struck in the Western provinces.\n\nThe third leading reverse device of the Gupta silver coinage is that of the standing peacock, with tail fully expanded. Coins of this type were struck by Kum\u00e2ra Gupta and Skanda Gupta of the Imperial dynasty, by Budha Gupta, by Toram\u00e2na, who seems to have succeeded him in M\u00e2lw\u00e2, by Bh\u00eema Sena, of whom a single coin has been obtained at Ajodhya, and by \u00cds\u00e2na Varman of Magadha.\n\nThe single trident coin of Kum\u00e2ra, described by Mr. Newton, was also a Western coin. It is perhaps possible to regard its device as a modification of the winged bird, but in the drawing it seems to be a trident, and nothing else; and, if the drawing is correct, we must admit the existence of a fourth trident class of silver coins.\n\nThe only known inscription of Budha Gupta is at Eran in M\u00e2lw\u00e2 dated 165 G.E., and it indicates that he ruled the country between the Jumna and the Narbad\u00e2,\u00b9 but the few known examples of his coinage have been obtained at or near Benares, and are dated 174. It is impossible to say where they were struck. Toram\u00e2na, like Budha, ruled in M\u00e2lw\u00e2. Only two specimens of his coinage are known to me. They are both in the British Museum, one being part of the Bush\n\n\u00b9 Cunningham, Arch. Rep. vol. x. p. 81; Corpus Inscr. Ind. vol. iii. p. 88, No. 19.\ncollection, and one presented by Miss Baring. Both bear the date 52, of which the interpretation is doubtful.\\(^1\\)\n\nAs in the case of Budha Gupta, it is impossible to say where Toram\u00e2na\u2019s coins were struck.\n\nThe Fantail Peacock coins of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta and Skanda Gupta were certainly struck chiefly, if not altogether, at mints in the Northern Provinces. I have already quoted Sir A. Cunningham\u2019s testimony that they are chiefly found at or near Benares, Ajodhya, Mathur\u00e2, and Sah\u00e2ranpur, all of which places are situated in the North-Western Provinces. A few have been obtained at Kanauj. The coins of both reigns are tolerably common, but I think those of Skanda Gupta are scarcer than those of his predecessor. I am not aware of any evidence that indicates the precise position of the mints from which the Northern silver coinage issued. The principal mint was presumably at the capital.\n\nThe Western silver coinage appears to have been a purely provincial issue, and was probably struck at the capital of Saur\u00e2shtra, which was very likely J\u00fbn\u00e2garh, close to which the great inscription of Skanda Gupta\u2019s reign is incised on the Girn\u00e2r rock.\n\nThe evidence clearly proves that the gold and copper coins were struck and chiefly current in territories far to the east of Kanauj, which territories may be roughly described as the Province of Benares, with some adjoining districts. The distribution of the architectural and sculptural remains of the Gupta dynasty confirms the testimony of the coins, and distinctly indicates that the capital of the Northern dominions of the Gupta Kings lay either between All\u00e2h\u00e1b\u00e2d (Pray\u00e2g) on the west, and Patna (P\u00e2taliputra) on the east, or at one of those cities. This is the region indicated by the Pur\u00e2nas as the seat of their power, and not the Do\u00e2b, or country between the Ganges and Jumna in which Kanauj is situated.\n\nThe V\u00e2yu Pur\u00e2na states that S\u00e2keta was included in their\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Sir A. Cunningham reads the date of one as 53, but I agree with Mr. Fleet in reading the dates on both specimens as 52. The character \u2014 which stands for 2 is a little blurred on one coin. Mr. Fleet reads the date on Budha Gupta\u2019s coins as 175, but Sir A. Cunningham\u2019s reading of 174 is supported by the evidence of an inscription dated in words and figures.\ndominions, and there can be no doubt that it was, whether we identify that city with Ajodhya, as Sir A. Cunningham proposes, or with Lucknow as suggested by Mr. Fergusson.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe first two princes of the dynasty, Gupta and Ghatotkacha, assumed only the subordinate title of Mah\u00e2r\u00e2j\u00e2, and seem to have been mere feudatory chiefs, presumably subject to an Indo-Seythian sovereign. It is improbable that they coined money, and they have left no inscriptions, and consequently we know nothing about them, except that they were respectively grandfather and father of Chandra Gupta I., the first independent sovereign of the dynasty. Probably their principality was in the neighbourhood of P\u00e2taliputra. Chandra Gupta I. married Kum\u00e2ra Devi of the Liehehhavi family of Nep\u00e2l, and the prominent record of this fact, both on coins and in inscriptions, is good evidence that the alliance was important. It may reasonably be assumed that it helped Chandra Gupta I. in his rise to greatness. I formerly supposed that the Liehehhavi family into which he married was that of Vais\u00e2li near P\u00e2taliputra, but recent discoveries show that the alliance was with the ruling family of Nep\u00e2l, of which the Vais\u00e2li Liehehhavis were probably a branch.\\(^2\\)\n\nMr. Hooper has suggested to me that Ajodhya may have been the Gupta capital. I have shown that there is reason to believe that it was the seat of a copper mint in the reigns of Chandra Gupta II. and Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, and, from the reign of Chandra Gupta I., it must have been one of the chief cities of the dynasty. Sir A. Cunningham has collected at Ajodhya traditions of kings named Samudra P\u00e2la and Chandra P\u00e2la, which seem to be confused reminiscences of the great Gupta dynasty.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cunningham, Arch.

Mr. Fergusson's suggestion that excavations should be made in the numerous mounds which exist in Lucknow deserves attention. I am inclined to think that he was right in identifying Lucknow with S\u00e2keta.\n\n\\(^2\\) See Hewitt on Early History of Northern India in J.R.A.S. Vol. XX. n.s. p. 356. The Vajjian or Vrijjian confederacy included nine tribes of Lichchhavis and nine tribes of Mallis. Mr. Hewitt thinks that these tribes were of Kolarian race.

The forged Gay\u00e2 inscription of Samudra Gupta purports to have been executed at Ajodhya, and issued from the camp of Samudra\nBut, I am still of opinion that P\u0101\u1e6daliputra has the best claim to be considered the Gupta capital. In the fourteenth line of the All\u00e2h\u00e2b\u00e2d Pillar inscription, which was recorded early in the reign of Chandra Gupta II. (i.e. circa A.D. 390 to 400), the city of Pushpapura is spoken of in connection with Samudra Gupta in such a way as to indicate that it was his capital. Mr. Fleet is inclined to think that the name Pushpapura is intended to mean Kusumapura, which was a name of Kanauj. It is true that in Sanskrit Kusumapura and Pushpapura have the same meaning, \u2018flower-city,\u2019 but it seems to me that when we know that the former synonym was appropriated to Kanauj, and the latter to P\u0101\u1e6daliputra, we are not warranted in making the gratuitous assumption that the names were exchanged in the All\u00e2h\u00e2b\u00e2d inscription. I repeat that there is not a tittle of evidence of any kind that Kanauj was the Gupta capital, and there is not the slightest reason for scepticism as to the testimony of the All\u00e2h\u00e2b\u00e2d inscription that Pushpapura or P\u0101\u1e6daliputra was the capital of Samudra Gupta. Its evidence is confirmed by the references to P\u0101\u1e6daliputra under that name in two records of Chandra Gupta II.\n\nThe Guptas had no more to do with Kanauj than they had to do with Mathur\u00e2 or Gay\u00e2, or any other big city in their empire; but errors die hard, and I suppose that, because Prinsep used an incautious phrase fifty years ago, people will still, fifty years hence, insist on speaking of \u2018the Guptas of Kanauj.\u2019\n\nThere is no reason to suppose that either Lower Bengal or the Panj\u00e2b was included in the Gupta empire. Its eastern boundary was probably in the neighbourhood of Bh\u00e2galpur, and its western near Delhi. During the reigns of Chandra Gupta II., Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, and Skanda (circa A.D. 390 to 480) it included the territories which are now known as Bih\u00e2r (North and South), the North-west Provinces and Oudh, Central India, Guzer\u00e2t, and K\u00e2thi\u00e2w\u00e2r.\n\nGupta there.

I have now carefully re-examined all the gold coins in both cabinets, correcting the errors in my previous observations, and have also scrutinized every specimen of the copper and silver coinage in the same collections. When my essay on the gold coins was published, I was dependent for information concerning the coins in the Bodleian Library on imperfect notes supplied by the late Mr.\nW. S. W. Vaux, F.R.S. I have now had an opportunity of personally examining the coins, and am in a position to give a detailed account of them.\n\nThe cabinet of the Bodleian Library at Oxford contains a large number, though not at all a complete series, of Gupta coins.\n\nThe Gupta and other Hindu coins in this cabinet have never been carefully catalogued, and were, at the time of my examination of them, very erroneously arranged and labelled. Numismatists will, therefore, I presume, be glad to be supplied with an accurate list of the Bodleian Gupta coins.\n\nWhen inspecting the collection, I had not leisure to thoroughly examine the silver coins, but, so far as I perceived, they include no novelty. A few silver pieces are labelled as belonging to certain of the so-called S\u0101h Kings (the Satraps of Saur\u0101sh\u1e6dra). Fifteen specimens are labelled as 'S\u0101h uncertain,' and this batch includes the Gupta coins, which are all of the Fantail Peacock type. I identified three of these coins, namely, No. 785, Skanda Gupta, No. 789, Budha Gupta, and one coin of Kum\u0101ra Gupta. Two of the coins bear the trident (tr\u012b\u015b\u016bl) reverse device, and are probably coins of the Bhat\u0101rka princes of Valabhi, but I did not succeed in deciphering the legends. It is quite possible that, on close examination of the trays of unclassed coins, some other silver Guptas may be discovered.\n\nAll the Gupta coins appear to belong to the collection presented to the Bodleian Library by Mr. J. Bardoe Elliott in 1859, part of which was purchased by that gentleman from Mr. Tregear in 1848. Some of the specimens belonged at one time to Sir A. Cunningham.\n\nI made a careful and minute examination of all the gold and copper coins. Two of the latter were picked out of a tray containing a most miscellaneous collection of unclassed coins. The following catalogue is correct, and will facilitate the accurate labelling of the gold and copper Gupta coins.\nCATALOGUE OF THE GOLD AND COPPER GUPTA COINS IN THE BODLEIAN LIBRARY.\n\nGOLD.\n\n| Reign                  | Type and Variety | No. of Label |\n|-----------------------|------------------|--------------|\n| Chandra Gupta I.      | King and Queen   | 683          |\n| Samudra Gupta         | Javelin, \\(a\\)   | 686, 686 bis, 687, 687 bis, 688\u2013691, 692 (on label 892) |\n|                       | Archer, \\(a\\)    | 693          |\n|                       | A\u015bwamedha, \\(a\\) | 694, 695     |\n|                       | \\(\\beta\\)        | 696          |\n| K\u00e2cha (?=Samudra Gupta) | Standard       | 678, 679     |\n| Chandra Gupta II.     | Archer, Class I., \\(a\\) | 708          |\n|                       | \\(\\beta\\)        | 709          |\n|                       | Class II., \\(a\\) | 697\u2013706      |\n|                       | Horseman to r.   | 732          |\n|                       | l., \\(a\\)       | 710, 711     |\n|                       | l., \\(\\beta\\)   | 713          |\n|                       | Lion-Trampler, \\(a\\) | 725          |\n|                       | \\(\\gamma\\)      | 724          |\n|                       | \\(\\delta\\)      | 726          |\n|                       | Umbrella        | 680\u2013682      |\n| Kum\u00e2ra Gupta          | Swordsman       | 717          |\n|                       | Archer, Class I.| 714\u2013716      |\n|                       | Class II.       | 719, 735, 736|\n|                       | Horseman to r., \\(a\\) | 712          |\n|                       | \\(\\beta\\)       | 731          |\n|                       | \\(\\gamma\\)     | 734          |\n|                       | l.              | 733          |\n| Skanda Kram\u00e2ditya     | Archer          | 684, 727, 728, 730 |\n| Nara B\u00e2l\u00e2ditya        |                 | 718, 720\u2013723, 729 |\n\nCOPPER.\n\n| Chandra Gupta II.     | Umbrella        | 752          |\n|                       | Standing King   | 750, 753, and one not numbered |\n|                       | Chandra Head, large | 754          |\n|                       | \\(\\beta\\)      | small one not numbered |\n| Kum\u00e2ra Gupta          | Standing King   | 751          |\nAbstract.\n\nGold.\n\nChandra Gupta I., Samudra Gupta, K\u00e2cha, Chandra Gupta II., Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, and Skanda Kram\u00e2ditya, 54 coins; Nara B\u00e2l\u00e2ditya, 6 coins.\n\nCopper.\n\nChandra Gupta II., 6 coins; Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, 1 coin.\n\nThe coins bearing the following numbers, namely, 737, 738, 740, 740 bis, and 741\u2013747, belong to the class of Indo-Scythian coins with N\u00e2gar\u00ee legends, which have been described by Mr. Thomas. Nos. 741 and 742 have the name Bhadra to the left of the spear, and resemble the coins described by me.\n\nNos. 741\u2013746 are like silver in colour, but were probably intended to pass as gold currency. No. 747 is of base pale gold. Nos. 738 and 740 are gold coins of the Bhri Shaka type.\n\nA manuscript list, signed A. Cunningham, shows that the Tregear collection had contained 8 copper coins of Chandra Gupta II., viz. 3 \u2018bust,\u2019 2 \u2018half-length,\u2019 and 3 \u2018Mah\u00e2r\u00e2j\u00e2.\u2019 The last must have been of the Umbrella type.

Jan. 1883.\n2 J.A.S.B. vol. liii. part i. p. 172, plate iv. 6.\n3 I am indebted to Mr. E. B. Nicholson, the Bodleian Librarian, for the grant of special facilities for the examination of the four trays containing Gupta coins, and for perusal of a book of manuscript correspondence concerning the Elliott collection. The Bodleian coin cabinet has, unfortunately, been much neglected in the past, and, until it is properly arranged, its contents can be of little use to numismatists. The Muhammadan coins have recently been arranged by Mr. Stanley Lane Poole, whose catalogue has been published. The other Indian coins are, as yet, in confusion, and no dependence can be placed on such labelling as has been attempted. The Librarian intends, I understand, to proceed with the arrangement of the whole cabinet, and to take steps for making it more accessible to students than it used to be.\nCHANDRA GUPTA I.\n\nKing and Queen Type.\n\nObv.

Cunningham has in his cabinet three examples of this type, one of which I have noted as belonging to variety a. One of his coins was procured at Gay\u00e2, and another at N\u00eemkh\u00e2r or N\u00eems\u00e2r, on the banks of the Gumti, a very sacred site in the S\u00eet\u00e2pur District, Oudh.\n\nThe legend 'Lichchhavaya\u1e25' records the marriage of the king into the Lichchhavi family of Nep\u00e2l. The stone inscriptions mention this alliance, and also state the queen's name, as given on the coins.\n\nCompare the rev. device with the sandstone sculpture, M. 10,\nCHANDRA GUPTA I.\u2014continued.\n\nbelieved to be from Mathur\u0101, in the Indian Museum, Calcutta. \"The figure is that of a woman, seated on the back of an undoubted lion. The left leg is bent at the knee, and the left knee rests on the head of the lion, the left foot being drawn up almost under the body in front, thus resting on the lion's back. The foot, however, as in the majority of Buddhist figures, has not the sole upturned. The right limb is only partially bent, and the foot rests on the side of the lion. . . . The most interesting feature of this sculpture, however, is the child, which is represented lying across the left thigh of the figure, resting on the left hand, the feet of the infant hanging down against the hind part of the left leg of the statuette.\" (Anderson, Catalogue and Handbook of the Archaeological Collections in the Indian Museum, part i. p. 184.) Also compare the effigies of the Greek Cybele, and of the Syrian Great Goddess.\n\nSAMUDRA GUPTA.\n\nTIGER TYPE.\n\nObv. King standing to r., wearing tight Indian waist-cloth, turban, necklace, armlets, and large earrings, trampling on body of tiger, which is falling backwards, while he shoots it in the mouth. Bow in king's r. hand, his l. is raised above his shoulder.\n\nImperfect legend on r. margin \u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0918\u094d\u0930 [\u092a\u0930\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0903], vy\u0101ghra [par\u0101krama], 'with the might of a tiger.'\n\nRev. Goddess to l., standing on a monster facing l., which has an elephant's head, and scaly fish's tail. Her r. hand is extended across a standard or spear, tipped with a crescent, and adorned with pennons. An expanded lotus-flower in her l. hand.\n\nLegend near margin to r. \u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e \u0938\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924\u0903, R\u0101ja Samudra Guptah.

Fig. 2.)\n\nThe execution of this coin is good, and the design spirited. The reading par\u0101krama in the obv. legend is probable, but not certain, the character for kra only being legible. The\nSAMUDRA GUPTA\u2014continued.\n\ncrescent-tipped spear or standard is also found on the coins of Chandra Gupta I. and the Battle-axe coins of Samudra Gupta. The reverse goddess is probably intended to represent the consort of Varu\u1e47a = Samudra, the ocean, or god of the waters, ante, p. 20. The standing figure of the goddess connects this type with the A\u015bwamedha type of Samudra Gupta and Kum\u0101ra Gupta, the Standard type of K\u0101cha, and the Umbrella type of Chandra Gupta II. The resemblance to the last-named type is especially close, because in one variety of it the goddess appears to stand likewise on a monster.\n\nI place this Tiger type first in the list of the issues of Samudra Gupta on account of the simple title R\u0101j\u0101 assumed by the king. In his other coins he assumes more ambitious titles. The obverse device served as the model for the Lion types of Chandra Gupta II. and Kum\u0101ra Gupta.\n\nA\u015bwamedha Type.\n\nObv. Horse, standing to l., unattended, and occupying most of field. In front of horse an altar, from which springs a bent pole, carrying three long streamers, which occupy top of field.\n\nBetween horse\u2019s legs the syllable \u0938\u093f, Si, sometimes standing on an altar or pedestal.\n\nMarginal legend imperfect; it includes the title \u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e\u0927\u093f\u0930\u093e\u091c R\u0101jadhir\u0101ja, followed by \u092a\u0943\u0925\u093f\u0935\u0940\u0902 \u091c\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f or \u091c\u092f\u0924\u093f, prithivim jitya or jayati, a boast of having conquered the earth.\n\nRev.

One specimen.\n\nMr. Rivett-Carnac, Sir A. Cunningham, and the late Sir E. C. Bayley\u2019s cabinet each possess one specimen of the type, but I have not noted to which variety these coins belong. The Freeling collection included one example, wt. 115 (J.A.S.B. vol. xxiv. p. 498). The Stacy cabinet (P.E. pl. xxiii. p. 32), and the Bush cabinet (J.A.S.B. vol. xxiv. p. 499) also possessed a specimen each.\n\nSeveral examples were included in the T\u00e2nd\u00e2 hoard, where they were associated with coins of Chandra Gupta I. and K\u00e2cha, and Battle-axe coins of Samudra Gupta.\n\nThe meaning of the syllable Si on the obverse has not yet been explained. The same syllable is found on the footstool in the Lyrist type of Samudra Gupta, and on an unpublished Indo-Scythian coin belonging to Sir A. Cunningham. The word par\u00e2krama on the reverse is a favourite with Samudra Gupta, and the wording of the obverse legend, as far as it has been deciphered, resembles the language used in the All\u00e2b\u00e2b\u00e2d Pillar inscription to describe his achievements. We know from the inscriptions that he actually performed the Aswamedha or horse sacrifice, as claiming the position of lord paramount of India. These facts, especially when considered in connection with the composition of the T\u00e2nd\u00e2 hoard, establish beyond doubt that the Aswamedha pieces were issued by Samudra Gupta. A coin of similar type, with the horse to the right, is assigned to Kum\u00e2ra Gupta (post, p. 110). Samudra\u2019s Asicamedha pieces agree in weight with his\nordinary coinage, but were evidently struck as commemorative medals, and were probably distributed to the Brahmins, who assisted in the sacrifice. For remarks on the Asvamedha and the titles of Samudra Gupta see Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, vol. iii. pp. 27-28.\n\nI think that the Asvamedha medals must have been struck early in his reign.\n\n**Lyrist Type.**\n\n*Obv.* King, wearing close cap and tight drawers, to front, with head turned to l., seated on high-backed couch, over edge of which his feet are dangling.

Fig. 6.)\n\nThese Lyrist coins, excepting the unique India Office example of variety \u03b2, like the \u0100\u015bwamedha pieces, have the appearance of medals rather than of ordinary coins. They commemorate Samudra Gupta's musical accomplishments, which are eulogized in the All\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d Pillar inscription, and it seems probable that this very peculiar coinage was issued to commemorate some special festival. Variety \u03b1 is finely executed in low relief, and the diameter is greater than that of any other type, except the fine and unique Retreating Lion coin of Chandra Gupta II., which also measures .91.\n\nThe India Office specimen of variety \u03b2 is very coarsely designed and executed, but does not look like a forgery. I cannot give any certain explanation of its peculiarities. Its general appearance is totally different from that of the variety \u03b1 coins, and its style is rather that of the late coins of Kum\u0101ra Gupta and Skanda Gupta. Perhaps it was struck in some outlying province.\n\nThe unexplained syllable Si on the obverse of variety \u03b1 obviously connects this type with the \u0100\u015bwamedha medals. Very likely the Lyrist medals were struck on the same occasion as the \u0100\u015bwamedha ones.\n\nThe goddess seated on the wicker stool makes her first appearance on this type.\n\nJAVELIN TYPE.\n\nObv. King standing (to l. in varieties \u03b1 and \u03b3, to r. in variety \u03b2), dressed in tailed coat and leggings in Indo-Scythian style, with r. hand (l. hand in variety \u03b2) casting incense on a small fire altar, and with l. arm (r. arm in variety \u03b2) resting on spear or javelin.

The Javelin coins may have been struck at any period of Samudra Gupta's reign. They certainly constituted his principal issue. The coins of variety \u03b1 are the commonest of all the Gupta gold coins, except the Archer type, Class II. A., of Chandra Gupta II. I have enumerated more than forty specimens, and have no doubt that many more exist. Variety \u03b2 is known only from the coin figured in the Asiatic Researches. Variety \u03b3 seems to be very scarce. I have seen only three specimens, as enumerated above. The fourth was included in the Bharsar hoard, but I do not know what became of the coins from that hoard.\nSAMUDRA GUPTA\u2014continued.\n\nThe reading of the obverse legend was settled by Mr. Fleet. One word, which should be a substantive, has not yet been deciphered. It looks like repara or ripara on the coin figured in Pl. I. Fig. 9.\n\nLine 17 of the All\u00e2h\u00e2b\u00e2d Pillar inscription commemorates Samudra Gupta's conquests in similar language.\u00b9\n\nThe tautological form of expression is common in the legends of the Gupta coins.\n\nThe first four forms of the letter m given on p. 35 ante, all occur in the legends of coins of this type, different forms being often used on a single coin. The coins figured (Pl. I. Fig. 7\u20139) illustrate some of the alphabetical variations. The square form of t, scarcely distinguishable from \u015b, shown in Fig. 8, is noticeable, but not very uncommon.\n\nArcher Type.\n\nObv.

This variety is identical with the Javelin type, except that the king holds a bow instead of a javelin. The epithet apratiratha, \u2018invincible in his war-chariot,\u2019 is applied to Samudra Gupta in the All\u00e2h\u00e2b\u00e2d Pillar inscription. The obv. legend has not been fully made out, but is one of the usual boasts of having conquered the earth. The obv. device served as the model for all the subsequent Archer coinages, but is distinctly superior to them in execution.\n\nBATTLE-AXE TYPE.\n\nObv.

This type is evidently intended to represent Samudra Gupta as an incarnation of Yama, the god of Death, under his name Krit\u00e2nta, \u2018he that maketh an end.\u2019 We may conjecture that the coins were struck to commemorate some of the king\u2019s numerous conquests, which are celebrated in detail in the All\u00e2h\u00e2b\u00e2d Pillar inscription.

The late Mr. Gibbs also had one.\n\nThese coins were formerly attributed to Gha\u1e6dotkacha, the second prince of the Gupta dynasty, and in my previous publication I followed Prinsep and Thomas in so assigning them. But Mr. Fleet has since proved that they cannot have been struck by Gha\u1e6dotkacha, and there is no reason\nwhatever for supposing that they were. The attribution was suggested by the misreading of Kacha for K\u00e2cha under the King\u2019s arm and a second mislection of the obv. marginal legend by Prinsep. The better-preserved examples show beyond all doubt that the name under the king\u2019s arm is K\u00e2cha, with the long vowel. Even if the name could be read Kaeha, which it cannot be, the syllables Kaeha could not stand alone, because the name Gha\u1e6dotkaeha in the Sanskritized form, in which alone it has come down to us, is a compound of gha\u1e6da and utkacha, the latter word being itself a compound of ut and kacha, and used adjectivally. Moreover, Gha\u1e6dotkacha, like his father Gupta, assumed only the subordinate title of Mah\u00e2r\u00e2j\u00e2, and it was not the practice of Mah\u00e2r\u00e2j\u00e2s to coin gold money, at all events, even if they may have coined sometimes in other metals. The name K\u00e2cha has not yet been found in any of the Gupta inscriptions, but the style and legends of the coins under discussion forbid us to doubt that they were struck by a Gupta king. The standing goddess on the reverse is unmistakeably executed in the same style of art as the similar figures on the Tiger and Aswamedha coins of Samudra Gupta, and the king\u2019s name is inserted under his arm on the obv. in the manner usual on the Gupta coins. The king\u2019s figure and attitude are identical with those of Samudra Gupta on the Javelin type. The epithet \u2018exterminator of all r\u00e2j\u00e2s\u2019 occurs five times in the Gupta inscriptions, in four of which it is certainly applied to Samudra Gupta, and in the fifth instance it probably refers to him. The formula g\u00e2m avajitya recurs on the Swordsman coins of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, and several Gupta types have legends identical in meaning, though not exactly in expression. In the T\u00e2nd\u00e2 hoard coins of K\u00e2cha were\n\n1 Ind. Ant. vol. xiv. p. 95 (March and June, 1885); Corpus Inscrip. Ind. vol. iii. p. 27, note 4.\n\n2 Ind. Ant. vol. xiv. p. 95. Mr. Fleet observes that the name K\u00e2cha is of rare occurrence, but that two kings or chieftains of the name are mentioned in an inscription of the fifth or sixth century A.D. in the Ajant\u00e2 caves, published in Arch. Survey of Western India, vol. iv. p. 130. The name Kacha, with the short vowel, occurs in the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata. See Dowson\u2019s Classical Dictionary of Hindu Mythology, etc., sub voce.\nK\u00e2cha (?=Samudra Gupta)\u2014continued.\n\nfound associated with coins of the A\u015bwamedha and Battle-axe types of Samudra Gupta, and with the King and Queen types of his father Chandra Gupta I. The alphabet of the legends agrees with that of Samudra Gupta\u2019s coinage. The entire evidence therefore points directly to the conclusion that the K\u00e2cha coins were struck by a member of the Gupta dynasty, and that they are contemporaneous with the coins of Samudra Gupta. The further inference that they were issued by Samudra Gupta himself is unavoidable, because there is no room for a co-ordinate independent contemporary, and Samudra\u2019s and K\u00e2cha\u2019s coinages are found together, and were evidently current in the same region.\n\nThe rayed emblem or wheel surmounting the standard on the obv. most likely symbolizes the sun. The Gupta symbolism is all Hindu. A similar rayed symbol is found detached on the Wheel variety of the Archer coins of Chandra Gupta II.\n\nCHANDRA GUPTA II.\n\nCouch Type.\n\nObv.

This engraving will be found at p. 425, vol. ii. of a scarce book, a copy of which is in the library of the Royal Asiatic Society, London. The full title is \"The Oriental Collections, consisting of Original Essays and Dissertations, Translations and Miscellaneous Papers; Illustrating the History and Antiquities, the Arts, Sciences, and Literature of Asia.\" Two volumes, quarto, n.d. Published by subscription for Cadell and Davies, Strand. The preface is dated 1797.\n\nThe king's attitude on the obv. is very nearly the same as that of Samudra Gupta in his Lyrist type, but here there is no lyre. The legends indicate that the coin must be assigned to Chandra Gupta II., and not to his grandfather. \u015ar\u012b Vikrama is the title specially affected by Chandra Gupta II.\u00b9 The obv. legend is identical with that of the Archer coins of Chandra Gupta II. The throned goddess of the rev. points to an early period of his reign. The later coins place the goddess on a lotus-flower seat.\n\nJAVELIN TYPE.\n\nObv. and rev.

It is of somewhat coarse workmanship, though not more so than many other Gupta coins of well-known types, and is undoubtedly genuine, as it was bought of a common man at a little above its intrinsic value. Weight 112\u00b75 grains. (See Pl. V. Fig 3.)\n\n\"Obv. King standing in the same posture as on Samudra Gupta's\n\n\u00b9 \"With regard to the meaning of Vikrama, which is properly 'heroism,' it may be observed that it is often used in a way where 'king' or 'hero' alone can be signified by it; thus Vikram\u0101ditya is as often called simply Vikrama as not... The word is applied also attributively as Dipakarnir iti khy\u0101to r\u0101j\u0101 bh\u016bd r\u0101jya-vikramah, 'There was a king named Dipakarni, the Vikrama of the realm.'\u201d\u2014(Wilson, Specimens of the Theatre of the Hindus, vol. i. p. 196.)\ncoins of the \"Javelin\" type (see Mr. Smith's Catalogue, J.A.S.B. vol. liii. part i. p. 172). King standing to left, dressed in be-jewelled close-fitting tail coat, trousers, and tall pointed cap, left arm resting on javelin, right hand casting incense on a small altar in left field; behind right arm the bird standard; corona round the head. Under the king's left arm, within the field, \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930 chandra; along the left hand margin \u092a\u0930\u092e\u093e \u092e\u093e \u092d\u0917\u093e para. ma. bhaga; along the right hand margin \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0940\u0930\u0903 \u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924 pravirah Gupta. The obverse is imperfectly struck; it looks as if the coin slipped on the die; most of the letters appear double, slightly overlapping each other; still they are all tolerably distinct, except \u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924 gupta, the \u092a p of which is wanting.\n\nThe marginal legend consists of abbreviated words, which I take to be in full paramabh\u00e1gavatapravirah Chandra Guptah, i.e. 'The most devoted worshipper of Vishnu, the mighty Chandra Gupta.' The circle is a well-known mark of abbreviation; its being used three times would seem to indicate three abbreviated words; but the first circle may be redundant; otherwise the phrase might be parama-mah\u00e1- (or mahad-)bh\u00e1gavata.\n\n\"Rev. King and queen sitting on a couch, facing each other. The king sits on the right side, right leg drawn up on the couch, and his right hand holding up and apparently showing to the queen a cup, shaped somewhat like a modern champagne glass. The queen sits on the left-side margin of the couch, with both legs down, supporting herself with the right arm on the corner of the couch, and her left arm a-kimbo. Both figures are dressed in lower garments (dhotis), the king in short ones reaching to above the knees, the queen in long ones coming down to below the knees. Both wear jewels in their hair and ears, also bracelets, the king also a necklace, and the queen anklets. There is a sort of corona round the king's head. The scene seems to represent a drinking bout, similar to what may be seen on old Buddhist sculptures. On the margin, behind the queen, \u0938\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0935\u093f \u015bri vi, similarly behind the king, \u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e krama\u1e25; that is \u0938\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0935\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e \u015ar\u012b Vikramah.\n\n\"It is doubtful whether this coin should be attributed to Chandra Gupta I. or Chandra Gupta II. The only point, however, which really seems to favour the attribution to the latter king, is the reverse legend \u015ar\u012b Vikramah, which has hitherto been only found on coins of that king. The words paramabh\u00e1gavata (if correct) have also been met with on coins of the same king (see J.A.S.B.,\nCHANDRA GUPTA II.\u2014continued.\n\nvol. liii. pp. 180, 182). But another, and more striking peculiarity points rather to an older date for the coin, and to Chandra I. as its issuer. The king's figure on the obverse has a decidedly antique look. It closely resembles that on the early coins of the so-called Gha\u1e6dotkacha, and of Chandra Gupta I. (ibid. plate ii. figs 1-4). The reverse device of 'King and Queen,' too, has hitherto been only observed on coins of Chandra Gupta I. and of Skanda Gupta (see ibid. pp. 129, 171). If the coin should be attributed to Chandra Gupta II., we must assume that, on some of his coins, he reverted to the more antique obverse device of his early predecessors. On the other hand, as hitherto only one type (King and Queen) of coin of Chandra Gupta I. has been discovered, it is impossible to assert, that he might not have used the legend \u015ar\u012b Vikrama\u1e25 on other coins. On the whole, the ascription to Chandra Gupta I. appears to me the more probable one.\"\u2014Proc.A.S.B. for 1888, pl. v. 3.\n\nThis type is the most curious addition made for a long time past to the varied series of Gupta coin types. The collotype accompanying Dr. Hoernl\u00e9's paper is unfortunately too indistinct to reproduce. I cannot accept his theory that the so-called circles in the obverse legend indicate abbreviations. Such abbreviations are unknown on the Gupta coins, and the 'circles' are evidently letters. The syllable ma on the l. obv. margin seems to me to be followed by the word 'Chandra,' the second 'circle' being the character \u091a Cha. On the r. margin the word either \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0930\u0903 or \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0930\u094d; pravirah or pravarah, appears distinct. The name Chandra under the king's arm on obv. is certain, and I think the word 'Gupta' is arranged vertically outside the javelin.\n\nThe rev. legend is as read by Dr. Hoernl\u00e9. The object, which he interprets as the bowl of the 'champagne-glass,' looks to me like part of the wheel symbol.\n\nThe reverse device is most peculiar, and according to the analogy of the other types, ought to be the obverse.\n\nThe king's figure recalls the Couch type.\n\nI think it more probable that the coin belongs to the reign of Chandra Gupta II. than to that of his grandfather.\nCHANDRA GUPTA II.\u2014continued.\n\nArcher Type.\n\nObv.

Wt. 146\u00b725.\n\nThe Archer type of Chandra Gupta is the form in which the most extensive issues of the Gupta gold coinage took place. Specimens of Class II. A. a, are met with in such numbers that they may be said to be common, an epithet which cannot well be applied to any other set of Gupta coins, except perhaps to the Javelin coins of Samudra Gupta.\n\nClass I., with the throned goddess on the reverse, is imitated from the Archer type of Samudra Gupta, but with marked deterioration in artistic execution. The coins of both varieties of this class are rare, and evidently belong to an\nCHANDRA GUPTA II.\u2014continued.\n\nearly period of the reign of Chandra Gupta II. The throned goddess does not again appear on the Gupta coinage.\n\nThe figure of the goddess Lakshmi, seated cross-legged on an open lotus-flower, which is the reverse device employed in Class II., had already made its appearance on some specimens of the Battle-axe coins of Samudra Gupta, which may be regarded as his latest issue. From the time that it was adopted by Chandra Gupta II., it became and long remained the favourite device in Northern India, suffering great degradation in course of time. Even in the case of coins which seem to have been struck in the reign of Chandra Gupta II., the execution of the device varies much, and is sometimes very barbarous.\n\nThe heavy coins (Class II. B.), which seem to have been struck to the suvarna standard of 146 grains, agree generally in device with the common Class II. A. a, but seem to differ in reverse legend. The name under the king's arm has a crescent above it, as in the other heavy types. The execution of these heavy coins of Chandra is decidedly barbarous, but so is that of many specimens of his coinage of normal weight. The latter are, also, frequently composed of very impure metal. Neither in style nor fabric is there much to choose between the better heavy and the worse light coins, and I am now inclined to assign the heavy coins, or most of them, which bear the name of Chandra, to the reign of Chandra Gupta II. They sometimes occur in base metal, and these specimens may be posthumous imitations. The better specimens may represent a provincial coinage. In my former publication I placed all these heavy coins in a supplement, but they are plainly Gupta coins, and I know of no later prince to whom they can be attributed. The genealogy of the local Gupta dynasty of Magadha does not include a Chandra. The title Vikram\u00e2ditya, which Chandra Gupta II. certainly used on his Umbrella gold pieces, and his silver and copper coins, is also used on these heavy gold coins. No single specimen shows the complete word, but comparison of\nCHANDRA GUPTA II.\u2014continued.\n\nMarsden\u2019s mli. with Mr. Grant\u2019s coin establishes the reading.\n\nThe scarce varieties \u03b4 and \u03b5 differ from the normal type in the circumstance that the king is turned to the r., instead of the l. The Gupta coinage shows by many examples that figures were depicted indifferently turned to the r. or l.\n\nThe rayed symbol, which I call a wheel, found on variety \u03b2, is probably intended for the sun, and may be compared with the similar symbol on the coins of K\u00e2cha. The weight of these Wheel coins is generally higher than that of the other varieties, but the difference is not sufficient to warrant the inference that a different standard of weight was adopted. In variety \u03b3 a crescent takes the place of the wheel, and presumably is intended to symbolize the moon. The crescent often occurs on Gupta coins.\n\nHorseman to Right Type.\n\nObv.

Kittoe read the epithet on the better-preserved Bharsar specimen as parama bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101raka, and I formerly accepted that reading. But Mr. Sykes\u2019 coin and the two examples of variety \u03b1 in the Bodleian Library read beyond all doubt parama bh\u0101gavata. I am, therefore, of opinion that Kittoe was mistaken in his reading. Chandra Gupta II. uses the title parama bh\u0101gavata on his Vikram\u0101ditya silver coins. It is also employed on the Winged Peacock silver coins of Kum\u0101ra Gupta, and both on the Winged Peacock and Bull silver coins of Skanda Gupta. The title parama bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101raka has not yet been met with on any other Gupta coin, and it is unlikely, though still possible, that it was correctly read on the Bharsar coin. It was much affected by the kings of Valabhi, the successors of the Guptas in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r\u012b, and by some members of the later Gupta dynasty of Magadha.\u00b9\n\nThe letters \u2018vajata\u2019 or \u2018vijita\u2019 on the obverse of variety \u03b2 suggest the legend \u2018vijit\u0101vanir avanipati\u2019 etc. of the Fantail Peacock silver coins of Kum\u0101ra Gupta and his successors.\n\n\u00b9 Corpus Inscr.

Varieties \u03b2 and \u03b3 are each known from a single specimen only, and \u03b1 is the only variety represented in the B.M.\n\nThe obv. device is an adaptation of that of the Tiger type of Samudra Gupta, and the rev. device is borrowed from the coinage of Chandra Gupta I.\n\nThe use of titles compounded with 'Vikrama' in both the obverse and reverse legends indicates that these coins, as well as the next two succeeding types, must be assigned to Chandra Gupta II. Kum\u0101ra Gupta issued closely similar coins, but they are distinguished readily by their use of the title 'Mahendra' and of the Peacock device. I do not think that anybody now disputes that the \u015ai\u1e45ha Vikrama coins must be assigned to the reign of Chandra Gupta II.\n\nI cannot accept as genuine the cast in the Stacey collection, which Mr. Thomas (J.A.S.B. vol. xxiv. p. 501) described as \"a cast from a genuino original.

The accident that it was found at Kanauj seems to have led Prinsep to use the erroneous phrase 'the Kanauj series' for the Gupta gold coins.\n\nIn artistic merit the coin is much superior to the bulk of the Gupta coinage, and is at least equal to the best issues of Samudra Gupta. The reverse device recalls that of the King and Queen type of Chandra Gupta I. These circumstances suggest the assignment of the coin in question to that prince, but the legends show that it belongs to the reign of his grandson. There is no reason to suppose that the elder Chandra Gupta assumed the title of \u015ai\u1e45ha Vikrama. The reverse legend differs from that of the other \u015ai\u1e45ha Vikrama coins by having \u015ar\u012b prefixed. The king's name is unfortunately missing, but so much of the obverse legend as was impressed on this piece is identical in form with the corresponding part of the legends of the Lyrist type of\nCHANDRA GUPTA II.\u2014continued.\n\nSamudra Gupta, and the Couch and Archer types of his son, Chandra Gupta II.

But other considerations prove conclusively that the coins in question must be assigned, as they were by Sir E. C. Bayley, Sir A. Cunningham, and myself, to Chandra Gupta II. They bear on both sides the title Vikram\u0101ditya, which was employed by Chandra Gupta II. both on his copper and silver coins, as well as on his heavy gold Archer pieces. No one would suggest that these copper and silver pieces were struck by Chandra Gupta I. The title Vikram\u0101ditya was used by Skanda Gupta on one variety of his silver coinage, but there is no indication of its use by Chandra Gupta I. The reverse device is the only reason that can be given for assigning the coins in question to an early date, and it would indicate their ascription rather to Samudra Gupta than to his father. But there is no authority for the use of the title of Vikram\u0101ditya in connection with Samudra Gupta, whereas, although it was adopted by Skanda Gupta, it and Vikram\u0101\u1e45ka, and other combinations of the word vikrama, were the favourite appellations of Chandra Gupta II. The obverse device affords a still stronger argument for the attribution of these coins to the later Chandra Gupta, inasmuch as it is substantially identical with that of the Umbrella type copper coins (Pl. IV. Figs. 8, 9), which have always been supposed to belong to the reign of Chandra Gupta II. The form of the obverse legend, kshitim avajitya sucharati, supports the same conclusion, because it is almost identical with the legend g\u0101m avajitya sucharati of the Swordsman type of Kum\u0101ra Gupta II., son and successor of Chandra Gupta II. The obverse fire-altar occurs on the Swordsman coins of Kum\u0101ra Gupta as well as on the coins of K\u0101cha and Samudra Gupta, and its occurrence on these Umbrella coins consequently does not prove an early date. The Bast\u012b hoard contained one gold Umbrella coin, associated\nCHANDRA GUPTA II.\u2014continued.\n\nwith nine Archer coins of Chandra Gupta II. These considerations leave no doubt on my mind that the Umbrella gold coins were struck in his reign, and not in that of his grandfather.\n\nI formerly gave the name Swordsman and Umbrella to this type to emphasize the connection between it and the Swordsman type of Kum\u0101ra Gupta, but now use a simpler designation. The close connection between the legends of these two types has induced me to place the Umbrella coins at the end of the series of the issues of Chandra Gupta II., but this reason is not decisive, and the style of the coins perhaps indicates an earlier date. It is noticeable that the copper Umbrella coins simply describe the king as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u015ar\u012b Chandra Gupta.\n\nThe attendant holding the umbrella on the gold coins is certainly a male, as depicted on the B.M. coins, for he is shown there as wearing top-boots. But the attendant, as shown on the Bast\u012b coin, seems to be a female, and her attitude differs slightly from that of the figure on the B.M. coins. The sculptures at Amar\u0101vat\u012b would lead us to expect umbrella-holders to be females.\n\nThe No. 2 Eden coin in the B.M. (variety \u03b2) is not in sufficiently good preservation to permit of certainty as to the object on which the reverse goddess stands, but it seemed to me to be a monster, something like that on which the goddess of Samudra Gupta\u2019s Tiger type is standing.\n\nKUM\u0100RA GUPTA.\n\nSwordsman Type.\n\nObv.

Cunningham tells me, were found together in the bed of the Ganges near Patna, on the site of P\u0101\u1e6daliputra, which has been mostly cut away by the river.\u00b9 When I published my catalogue of gold coins, I was not aware of the existence of the Bodleian specimen. Both coins have the same mon. and were probably struck from a single die. Both are in good preservation. The Bodleian specimen shows that the true reading on the obv. is g\u0101m, not kshitim. The form of obv. legend resembles that of the Umbrella coins of Chandra Gupta II., with which these Swordsman coins are also connected by the resumption of the fire-altar device, which had been previously used by K\u0101cha and Samudra Gupta. For these reasons I consider the Swordsman type to be the earliest issue of Kum\u0101ra Gupta. Unfortunately the title on the l. obv. margin, which corresponded to the Vikram\u0101ditya of the Umbrella coins, has been lost. The crescent over the \u0915\u0941, Ku, on the obv. is noticeable, because these Swordsman coins are of normal weight, while the crescent over the initial of the king\u2019s name is generally found on the heavy coins of suvar\u1e47a standard, and not on the normal pieces. It is, however, found on some of the normal Archer coins of Kum\u0101ra Gupta. Its use\n\n\u00b9 Arch. Rep. vol. viii. p. 24.\nKUM\u0100RA GUPTA\u2014continued.\n\non coins which undoubtedly belong to Kum\u0101ra Gupta of the Early or Imperial dynasty is an indication that I am correct in the opinion which I now hold that at any rate the better executed heavy gold coins belong to the princes of the Imperial dynasty.\n\nThe figure of the king in the type under discussion is of the short stumpy form, with a peculiar bend, which is specially characteristic of the coinage of Kum\u0101ra Gupta. The artistic merit of these coins is small, but they are not inferior to some of the Archer coins of Chandra Gupta, though decidedly inferior to the Sinha Vikrama pieces.\n\nARCHER TYPE.\n\nObv.

Supposed by Cunningham (Arch. Rep. vol. iii. p. 137) to be a coin of the later Kum\u0101ra Gupta of Magadha.\nKUM\u0100RA GUPTA\u2014continued.\n\nIt is very difficult to arrange satisfactorily these Archer coins of Kum\u0101ra Gupta, and I cannot profess to have solved the problem either now, or in my previous publication.\n\nThe coins (A) of normal weight (that is to say, of about 125 grains) readily fall into two classes, those with the bow-string inwards, and those with the bow-string outwards. The first class is divided into a number of varieties based on differences in the obverse legend, but this classification is uncertain and unsatisfactory owing to doubts as to what the full legend was. Mr. Sykes\u2019 coin and Mr. Carnac\u2019s similar specimen (\u03b5) undoubtedly constitute a distinct variety. Both these coins have the bow-string inwards, but have the king\u2019s name Kum\u0101ra arranged vertically under the arm, as in Class II.\n\nThe (\u03be) coin in the Freeling collection, mentioned by Thomas, and said to bear the legend deva vijit\u0101vanir avanipati Kum\u0101ro Gupto, if genuine, is also quite distinct from all other known pieces. But I cannot help feeling doubts about the genuineness of this coin. It is very odd that it should have the legend of the Fantail Peacock silver coins. However, it may be genuine, and it must, for the present, be classed separately. I have not been able to obtain access to the collection of the late Mr. Freeling.\n\nThe remaining coins of Class I. seem always to have Ku under the king\u2019s arm, and the obv. marginal legends noted are as follows:\n\n1. a. Jayati Mahendra, with other legend illegible.\n2. \u03b2. Parama r\u00e1j\u0101dhir\u00e1ja \u015ar\u012b [Kum\u0101ra Gupta Mahena]dra.\n3. \u03b3. jatara (? = [a]jita r\u00e1[j\u00e1].\n4. \u03b4. \u015ar\u012b mah\u00e1r\u0101j\u0101dhir\u00e1ja \u015ar\u012b Kum\u0101ra Gupta.\n\nThe jatara fragment of legend cannot apparently be reconciled with any of the other inscriptions. The Kotw\u0101 coin shows that the syllables Ku and r\u00e1 were associated with the words jayati Mahendra, and these words might very well have formed the conclusion of the third form of legend. The second form of legend appears to be distinct.\nKUM\u00c2RA GUPTA\u2014continued.\n\nKum\u00e2ra Gupta issued silver coins with the title r\u00e1j\u00e1dhira\u00e1ja, and others with the higher title mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1dhira\u00e1ja.\n\nThe B heavy coins vary in weight from 143 to 151 grains, and were certainly not struck to the same standard as the coins of normal weight. I formerly placed these pieces, with all those of similar weight, in a supplement, but am now disposed to think that many of these pieces were struck by the kings of the Early or Imperial dynasty. They vary very considerably in style and execution. Some, including the one figured in Pl. II. 12, are not visibly inferior in quality of metal to many of the undoubted coins of the Early dynasty, nor can the design and execution be confidently stated to be ruder. Others are composed of utterly base metal, and are very roughly designed and struck. I formerly misread the reverse legend as Sri Mahendra\u00e1h, which it certainly is not. It is Sri Kum\u00e2ra Gupta. The word Kum\u00e2ra is plain on some of the base metal coins, and the first syllable of Gupta can be read on the coin figured.\n\nSir A. Cunningham assigns the K\u00e2ligh\u00e2t specimen to the Kum\u00e2ra Gupta of Magadha, who lived about a century later than his namesake, the father of Skanda Gupta. It is probable enough that the base metal specimens belong to his reign, but I now think it most probable that the coins in tolerable gold, like the one figured, belong to the Early Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, and I would assign the similar coins of Chandra Vikram\u00e2ditya and Skanda Kram\u00e2ditya also to the princes of the Early or Imperial dynasty.\n\nThe Class II. coins of normal weight, which have the bow-string outwards, are as rude in style and execution as the heavy coins, but undoubtedly bear both the names Kum\u00e2ra and Mahendra, and there appears to be no reason to doubt that these coins were struck by the Early Kum\u00e2ra Gupta.\n\nThe detached letters which are found, sometimes between the king\u2019s feet, and sometimes before his face, on many coins of the Archer type, may be only parts of the marginal\nKUM\u00c2RA GUPTA\u2014continued.\n\nlegend. The character before the king's face is, I think, always part of the legend, but that between his legs may be a mint-mark, or other special sign.\n\nSir A. Cunningham notes (Arch. Rep. vol. xvi. p. 81) that he has two gold coins of Kum\u00e2ra with the title Kram\u00e2ditya, which was specially affected by Skanda Gupta.\n\nHorseman to Right Type.\n\nObv. King, bareheaded, with curly hair, on high-stepping horse, proceeding to r. No weapon visible, except, perhaps, in one coin. Marginal legend various, and not fully deciphered.\n\nOne form may be probably restored as \u0905\u091c\u093f\u0924 \u0935\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e \u092e\u0939\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930\n\u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924 \u0926\u0947\u0935\u091c\u0928\u093f\u0924 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092a\u0924\u093f \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0924\u093f \u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f \u0915\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0930, ajita vikrama Mahendra Gupta devajanita kshitipati r\u00e1jati vijaya Kum\u00e1ra, 'the invincible in might, Mahendra Gupta, begotten of Deva (or 'of the Devas'), the lord of earth, the victorious Kum\u00e1ra, rules.'\n\nAnother form is \u092a\u0930\u092e \u092d\u093e\u0917\u0935\u0924 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e\u0927\u093f\u0930\u093e\u091c \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0940\n\u092e\u0939\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924:, parama bh\u00e1gavata mah\u00e1r\u0101j\u0101dhirdaja Sri Mahendra Guptah, 'the most devout worshipper of the holy one, the sovereign of Mah\u00e2r\u00e2jas, Sri Mahendra Gupta.'\n\nOther variations are noted below.\n\nRev.

Its find-place is not specified further than 'somewhere between Benares and Fyzabad.' It is a coin of Kum\u0101ra Gupta, of the ' Horseman to left' type, (see ibid. p. 193) (sic. the horseman is to right). I publish it because it has the obverse legend exceptionally well preserved, and may help to establish its correct reading. (See Pl. V. Fig. 5.) It runs thus: + + \u092e\u0939\u0930\u091c\u092a\u0924 behind the king's back, the vowel marks being clipped off; \u091a\u093f between the king's and the horse's head; \u0924\u093f\u092a\u0924\u093f \u0930\u0925\u0940\u092a\u093e\u0926 + + + in front and below the horse; there would be space for about six more letters behind the horse, joining the two preserved portions of the legend, though possibly the whole of the space was not occupied by letters. I would suggest to restore the legend thus: \u092e\u0939\u0930\u091c\u092a\u0924\u093f-\u0924\u093f\u092a\u0924\u093f-\u0930\u0925\u0940\u092a\u093e\u0926 [\u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f-\u0915\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924\u0903], maharajapati\u2014kshitipati\u2014rathipada\u2014vijaya\u2014Kum\u0101ra\u2014Guptah, i.e. 'the lord of Mah\u0101r\u0101jas, the lord of the earth, the famous chariot-man, the victorious Kum\u0101ra Gupta.' The reading of the preserved portion of the legend, as above given, is practically certain, except the akshara \u0918\u0940 thi, the consonant of which is too blurred to be recognizable, and the vowel might be a long \u0101. The bracketed portion of the reading I have supplied from another specimen of the 'Horseman to left' type in the Society's collection (see Proceedings A. S. B. for 1882, pp. 111\u2014114, also J.A.S.B., vol. liii. p. 194). The reverse has, as usual, the legend \u0905\u091c\u093f\u0924\u092e\u0939\u0947\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930 ajita-\nKUM\u00c2RA GUPTA\u2014continued.\n\nMahendra, i.e. 'the unconquered Mahendra,' and a female figure seated on a morh\u00e1, holding a fillet in her r., and a long-stalked lotus in her l. hand.

The reverse legend Mahendra Kum\u00e2ra can be made out on several coins. The peacock was the special emblem of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta.\n\nThe obverse legend cannot be fully deciphered on any coin I know of. The only certain word in it is jayati, and the name Kum\u00e2ra is almost certain.\n\nThe mechanical execution of the Lind coin in the B.M. is unusually delicate, and the photograph does not do it justice.\n\nI cannot discover any indication to show whether this type was struck early or late in the reign. Specimens of it seem chiefly to come from the finds at or near All\u00e2h\u00e2b\u00e2d, but they are not confined to that locality.\n\nLION-TRAMPLER TYPE.\n\nObv. King standing to r., bareheaded, wearing waistcloth; in energetic attitude, with bow in l. hand, and with l. foot trampling on body of lion, which is falling backwards.\n\nThe obv. legend includes words which read as \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0938\u093f\u091a (or \u0938\u0948\u091a) \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0924, S'ri Siksha (or Saiksha) devata.\n\nRev.

(J.A.S.B. vol. xxi. p. 397.)\n\nS. \u201cOne Kum\u0101ra Gupta, belonging to Mr. Sykes, of the \u2018Combatant lion\u2019 type (as ibid. p. 197, pl. iv. fig. 3), weight 119\u00b775 grains; the obverse legend is very imperfect; on left margin there are traces of three letters, the last two of which look like \u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e krama (perhaps \u0935\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e vikrama); on the right margin there are traces of seven letters, the first two looking like \u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e \u015bri, and the last like \u0915\u0941 ku; there must have been other letters below the king and behind the lion, joining the two preserved portions, and making up \u0915\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924\u0938\u094d\u092f Kum\u0101ra Guptasya, the initial \u0915\u0941 ku of which is preserved.

The reading of the obv. legend, so far as it has been deciphered, rests mainly on the following observations of Sir A. Cunningham:\n\n\u201cAncient coins are occasionally found at Mah\u0101sth\u0101n [in the Bogra or B\u0101graha District, Lower Bengal],\u00b2 and its suburbs. About 1862 a number of gold coins were found at B\u0101hmanp\u0101ra,\n\n\u00b9 Dr. Hoernl\u00e9 in Proc. A.S.B. for 1888. The references are to my Catalogue of Gupta Gold Coins.\n\n\u00b2 Identified with Panandra Vardhana, a city mentioned by Hiuen Tsiang, the capital of the country known as Paundra des\u0101, or Varendra, or Eastern Ganda, supposed to be the region called Mah\u0101 Kant\u0101ra in the Allah\u0101b\u0101d Pillar Gupta inscription. (Arch. Rep. vol. xv. pp. 102-112.)\nKUM\u00c2RA GUPTA\u2014continued.\n\nout of which Mr. Beveridge obtained two... They were both Gupta coins, one of Chandra Gupta II., and the other of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta.... I am able to give a more complete reading of the legends on both sides [scil. of the latter] from a coin in my own collection. Obv. S'ri Mahendra Sinha par\u00e2krama. Rev. Kum\u00e2ra Gupta....\u201d\u2014(Arch. Rep. vol. xv. p 116.)\n\nThe reverse legend with the title adhir\u00e2ja is plain on more than one specimen. The obv. legend is remarkable for the use of the word par\u00e2krama, which was specially affected by Samudra Gupta. Prinsep had succeeded in deciphering the word on the coin he figured.\n\nTwo Queens Type.\n\nObv. King standing to front in centre of field, with both hands clasped on his breast, apparently clad in a long robe. On each side a standing female, with one hand raised towards the central figure, and the other resting on her hip. The central figure is the shortest. Above the king's r. shoulder the bird standard. To the r. of the king \u0915\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0930, Kum\u00e2ra, and to the l. \u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924, Gupta. The letters lie on their side; the word Kum\u00e2ra is read from above, and the word Gupta from below.\n\nMarginal legend of about thirty characters all round the coin, quite illegible.\n\nRev. Goddess to the front, seated on lotus, from l. corner of which two leaf or flower-buds spring. In her r. hand she holds a bud, and her l. rests empty on her hip.\n\nLegend on r. margin \u0938\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093e\u092a\u0903, S'ri Prat\u00e2pa\u1e25. Mon.\n\nReferences and Remarks.\n\nB.M. Presented by Mr. H. Rivett-Carnac, C.I.E., who bought the coin at Mathur\u00e2. Mon. 8b. Wt. 115. (Pl. III. Fig. 4.) This very peculiar piece is at present unique, but there is no reason to doubt its genuineness. A notice of it, with a poor woodcut, was published in Proc. A.S.B. Nov. 1883, p. 144. The legend shows that the obv. central figure is the king, and I think the females must certainly be his consorts. The buds springing from the reverse lotus are noticeable, and the title S'ri Prat\u00e2pa has not been met with elsewhere.\nKUM\u0100RA GUPTA\u2014continued.\n\nA\u015bwamedha Type.\n\nObv. Thick-barrelled horse, with breast band, standing to r., occupying field, and facing a pole carrying pennons, which float over the horse.\n\nMarginal legend illegible.\n\nRev. Female standing to l., facing a standard with vase-shaped head, and adorned with pennons. She carries a yak\u2019s tail fly-whisk (chauri) in her r. hand, resting on her shoulder; her l. hand hangs down, and seems to hold a small object.\n\nLegend following r. margin \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0905\u0936\u094d\u0935\u092e\u0947\u0927 \u092e\u0939\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930, Sri a\u015bwamedha mahendra. No mon.\n\nReferences and Remarks.\n\nA.C. At present unique; obtained at Mathur\u0101. Wt. 124\u00b75. (Pl. III. Fig. 5.) The obv. and rev. devices closely resemble those of the A\u015bwamedha medals of Samudra Gupta, the most striking difference being that the horse in this coin is turned to the r.\n\nThe legend on the A\u015bwamedha pieces of Samudra Gupta is a\u015bwamedha par\u0101krama\u2014here it is clearly Sri a\u015bwamedha mahendra. Mahendra was the special personal title of Kum\u0101ra Gupta, and, so far as is known at present, was not assumed by any other member of the dynasty. The legend therefore indicates that this new type must be assigned to Kum\u0101ra Gupta. The style of the reverse female figure leads to the same conclusion. She has the stumpy bent figure which is characteristic of Kum\u0101ra\u2019s coins, and is quite different from the tall, upright figures of the standing females on Samudra\u2019s coinage. This coin is the only evidence that Kum\u0101ra Gupta performed the a\u015bwamedha sacrifice. There is nothing to show whether the coin was struck early or late in his reign.\n\nSKANDA GUPTA.\n\nKing and Queen Type.\n\nObv. Bird-standard, with pennons, in centre of field; king bareheaded, with curly hair, standing in l. field, facing r.;\nSKANDA GUPTA\u2014continued.\n\nqueen standing in r. field opposite king. King wears either a waistloth (dhott\u00ee), or short drawers (janghiy\u00e2), and armlets, and with l. hand grasps middle of bow, the string of which is parallel and next to standard. His r. hand rests on his hip. Queen wears Indian woman\u2019s waistcloth (lahanga), and in r. hand holds up to the bird-standard an object, probably a flower.\n\nMarginal legend quite illegible, but it probably included the names of both king and queen.\n\nRev. Goddess (Lakshmi) seated cross-legged on lotus-flower seat, holding lotus-flower in l., and fillet in r. hand.\n\nLegend on r. margin \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0938\u094d\u0915\u0928\u094d\u0926 \u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924\u0903, S\u2019ri Skanda Guptah.\n\nMon.\n\nReferences and Remarks.\n\nB.M.

Res. vol. xvii. pl. i. 12.\n\nA.S.B. One specimen.\n\nThis type is one of the rarest in the Gupta series. I have never heard of any specimen except the two above mentioned. The analogy of the King and Queen coins of Chandra Gupta I. makes it almost certain that the figures on the obverse are those of Skanda Gupta and his queen. Her name is not mentioned in the extant inscriptions. The Two Queens type of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta may also be compared.\n\nARCHER TYPE.\n\nObv. King with curly hair, wearing tailed coat, standing upright to l., holding arrow in r. hand, which is extended across the bird-standard adorned with pennons, and in l. hand holding bow, the string of which is turned inwards.\n\nUnder king\u2019s l. arm \u0938\u094d\u0915\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0903, Skanda, arranged vertically.\n\nIn Class B. a crescent above name.\n\nMarginal legend not deciphered.

One was obtained at Gay\u00e2.\nP.E. pl. xxiii. 20. A rude coin.\n\nMr. Rivett-Carnac, at the beginning of 1887, showed me fifteen of the Kram\u0101ditya coins. Fourteen of these were of the usual size, about \u00b78 in diameter, the fifteenth was a larger\nSKANDA GUPTA\u2014continued.\n\nand flatter coin, nearly a full inch in diameter. Two of the fourteen are now in the B.M. One was obtained at Bhitar\u00ee, an ancient site in the Gh\u00e2z\u00eepur District, N.W.P., where there are remains of buildings of the time of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, and a well-known inscription of the reign of Skanda Gupta. The other coins were, I think, obtained at or near Benares.\n\nI formerly relegated the Kram\u00e2ditya pieces to a supplement, and doubted if they were issued by Skanda Gupta. But, on reconsideration, I do not find any sufficient reason for supposing that they were struck by any other prince. No Skanda Kram\u00e2ditya is known except he be the Skanda Gupta, son of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, and numerous silver coins of Skanda Gupta Kram\u00e2ditya exist. The crescent under the king's arm occurs on coins which undoubtedly belong to Kum\u00e2ra Gupta of the Early or Imperial dynasty. The difference in style between the heavy and the normal weight Archer coins of Skanda is not sufficient to warrant the assignment to them of different dates. I now believe that Chandra Gupta II., Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, and Skanda Gupta all, for some reason unknown, struck gold coins, both according to the Greek stater (aureus) standard, and the native suvar\u1e47a standard.\n\nThe reverse legend of the normal weight Archer coins of Skanda is the same as that of his King and Queen coins.\n\nSUPPLEMENT.\n\nThe princes named Nara B\u00e2l\u00e2ditya, Prak\u00e2\u015b\u00e2ditya, and ? V\u00eera Sena Kram\u00e2ditya, whose coins are briefly discussed in the following pages, do not seem to belong to the Imperial Gupta family, at least to its direct line. It is quite possible that they were connected with it by ties of blood.\n\nA strict adherence to my plan would preclude me from noticing these coins, but I do not like to pass them over. The coins of ? V\u00eera Sena Kram\u00e2ditya are so remarkable that they deserve a fuller notice than they have yet received, and the present is a convenient opportunity for noticing them.\nThe coins of Nara B\u00e2l\u00e2titya and Prak\u00e2\u015b\u00e2ditya were included in my former catalogue, but my descriptions of them in some points require correction, and the necessary corrections can be made more conveniently now than on any other occasion.\n\nI regret that I am still unable to identify the king who took the title of Prak\u00e2\u015b\u00e2ditya, and, in spite of the rude style of his coins, I should not be surprised if he turned out to be either Kum\u00e2ra or Skanda Gupta. In the Bharsar hoard his coins were found associated with coins of Samudra Gupta, Chandra Gupta II., Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, Skanda Gupta, and with those of no one else. We now know that Skanda Gupta certainly assumed the title of Vikram\u00e2ditya, as well as that of Kram\u00e2ditya, and that Kum\u00e2ra Gupta took the style of S\u00eer\u00ee Prat\u00e2pa, as well as his better-known title of Mahendra. There is thus no \u00e0 priori improbability in the assumption that the title Prak\u00e2\u015b\u00e2ditya may belong to either Kum\u00e2ra or Skanda Gupta. The difference in style between the Prak\u00e2\u015b\u00e2ditya coins and some issues of Kum\u00e2ra and Skanda Gupta is not sufficient to warrant any certain inference as to difference of date. The contrast in style between the various issues of Chandra Gupta II. is very great, and, in a less degree, similar variations in execution and design may be perceived in the coinages of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta and Skanda Gupta.\n\nBut it is more likely that Prak\u00e2\u015b\u00e2ditya is a title of an early member of the later dynasty of the Guptas of Magadha, which ruled from about A.D. 480 to A.D. 700 or a little later. The inscriptions do not mention Prak\u00e2\u015b\u00e2ditya, who must not be confounded with Praka\u1e6d\u00e2ditya, son of B\u00e2l\u00e2titya, who seems to have been king of Benares at the close of the seventh century A.D., and is mentioned in the S\u00e2rn\u00e2th inscription.\u00b9\n\nThe same document mentions an earlier B\u00e2l\u00e2titya.\n\nI cannot venture to decide on the identity of Nara B\u00e2l\u00e2titya of the coins. Sir A. Cunningham is disposed, he tells me, to identify him with the King B\u00e2l\u00e2titya of Magadha, the opponent of the H\u00fb\u1e47a King Mihirakula. Mr.\n\n\u00b9 Corpus Inscrip. Ind. vol. iii. No. 79, p. 284.\nFleet fixes A.D. 515 as the date for the commencement of the career of Mihirakula,\\(^1\\) and Mr. Beal, though making some corrections in Mr. Fleet\u2019s detailed arguments, accepts that date.\\(^2\\) I doubted it at one time, but now admit that it seems to be established. The date of A.D. 520 or A.D. 530 would very well suit the style and epigraphy of the coins of Nara B\u0101l\u0101ditya, but a great obstacle in the way of assigning these coins to the B\u0101l\u0101ditya, the opponent of Mihirakula, is this, that the coins are as much Hindu in character as the coins of Kum\u0101ra and Skanda Gupta of the same Archer type, whereas the opponent of Mihirakula \u201cprofoundly honoured the law of Buddha.\u201d\\(^3\\) We should expect to see Buddhist symbols on his coins. The name Nara does not seem to occur in the inscriptions.\n\nNara B\u0101l\u0101ditya may be the father of Praka\u1e6d\u0101ditya mentioned in the S\u0101rn\u0101th inscription, and the date thus obtained (circa A.D. 650) is a possible one, though rather late for the style of the coins, which look to me a century earlier.\n\n**PRAK\u0100S\u0100DITYA.**\n\n**Lion and Horseman Type (suvar\u1e47a standard).**\n\n*Obv.* Horseman (king), wearing low cap, advancing to r. to meet a dragon-like animal with open jaws.

The figure of the reverse goddess resembles that on the coins of Skanda Kram\u00e2ditya and Nara B\u00e2l\u00e2ditya, the crossed legs being drawn as a horizontal bar, without distinguishing one limb from the other. In other respects the execution of these coins is not distinctly inferior to that of the Swordsman coins of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, and some of the normal weight Archer coins of the same king, which are very coarsely designed and struck.\n\nSome specimens (Pl. III. Fig. 10) have a character under the horse, which looks like a u. A similar character is found on the coins of Vish\u1e47u Chandr\u00e2ditya, who was probably Vish\u1e47u Gupta Deva of Magadha, who reigned about A.D. 700.\u00b9 But on one of the A.C. coins the character under the horse looks like r, and may be part of the marginal legend. Wherever it is not part of the legend, it may be intended for the initial of the king's proper name. Prak\u00e2s\u00e2ditya, like Kram\u00e2ditya, Vikra-\n\n\u00b9 Arch.

I do not think that these coins of Prak\u00e2s\u00e2ditya are later than, say, A.D. 550. They look rather earlier than those of Nara, but it is very difficult to judge the style of semi-barbarous issues. The metal of the Prak\u00e2s\u00e2ditya coins appears to be of better quality than that found in the other suvarna coinages.

One coin.\n\nThe above coins are gold, though the metal is always\nimpure. But a large number of coins bearing the name of Nara are composed of utterly base metal, and are executed with extreme coarseness. Six specimens of this class are in the B.M. collection, and thirty-three similar pieces are in the I.O. collection, now incorporated with the B.M. I did not think it worth while to examine the I.O. base metal coins very minutely, but they do not all bear the name of Nara; many, however, do. As already noted, the B.M. collection includes eleven similar coarse pieces with the name of Kunn\u00e2ra. I am disposed to think that all the coins of this kind are from fifty to two hundred years later than Skanda Gupta, but I cannot profess to assign them definitely. The gold coins of Nara are very much the same in style as the heavy coins in tolerable gold bearing the names of Chandra, Kum\u00e2ra and Skanda, and are not, I think, far removed from them in date. I do not think it probable that they are later than A.D. 550. The base metal coins look like late imitations of them.\n\nIn my former catalogue I erroneously wrote N\u00e2ra for Nara, and, following Mr. Thomas, added the cognomen Gupta, for which there is no authority.\n\n**V\u00eera [?

Sinha] Kram\u0101ditya\u2014continued.\n\nweighed 169 grains. The coins are oval in form. They seem later than the coins of the Imperial Guptas, though not much later, and are connected with the coinage of Skanda Gupta by the use of the Lakshmi reverse, the bull symbol, and the title Kram\u0101ditya. On the coin figured the first three syllables of this title are distinct, and the form of the letter m is of the oldest style found on the Gupta coinage. The king's name on the obv. cannot be made out with certainty, but certainly begins with V and a vowel mark. The name looks like V\u012bra Sena. I cannot at present make out to whom the coins belong, or to exactly what period. The weight is very peculiar. The coins may possibly have been struck to the 100 rati standard of 182\u00b75 grains, but it is much more probable that they were struck to the standard \"called by metrologists the Persian, the standard on which coins were struck in all parts of the Persian Empire, notably the sigli stamped with the figure of the Persian king, which must have freely circulated in the northern parts of India, which paid tribute to the Persians... In the Persian standard the unit or drachm weighs 84\u201386 grains.\"\u00b9\n\nThese coins of Kram\u0101ditya resemble in form the Persian sigli, and I have little doubt that they follow the Persian standard of weight, which had been used long before by the Bactrian kings Eukratides, Heliocles, and Antialcidas.\n\nChapter IX.\u2014Catalogue of Silver Coins.\n\nContents.\n\n| PAGE |\n|-------|\n| Chandra Gupta II .................................................. 120 |\n| Kum\u0101ra Gupta .......................................................... 123 |\n| Skanda Gupta ............................................................ 128 |\n| Uncertain ............................................................... 132 |\n| Skanda Gupta ............................................................ 133 |\n| Budha Gupta ............................................................. 134 |\n| Supplement.

I do not know the exact find-spot of any of them, but Dr. B\u00fchler's coins certainly came from the Bombay Presidency, and I have no doubt that the other specimens also are from the West.\n\nThe reading of the legend has been finally settled by Mr. Fleet (Ind. Ant. vol. xiv. p. 65). It is needless to note earlier erroneous readings, or the theories based upon them.\nCHANDRA GUPTA II.\u2014continued.\n\nMr. Fleet translates the words \u015ar\u012b Guptakulasya by the phrase 'who belongs to the glorious family of the Guptas,' and Sir A. Cunningham renders them 'the descendant of \u015ar\u012b Gupta.' Either interpretation is legitimate, and I have, therefore, preferred a literal rendering which retains the ambiguity of the original. I think the honorific prefix \u015ar\u012b is better left untranslated. No English word has exactly the same connotation.\n\nThe reverse device of these coins is certainly a rude diagram of a bird, presumably a peacock, standing to the front, with wings expanded, and tail concealed by the body. It is found also on the coins of Kum\u0101ra Gupta and some of those of Skanda Gupta in the same form, and on one class of Skanda Gupta's coinage in a modified, degraded form, which has been called an altar.\n\nThe sun, or cluster of stars, and crescent were borrowed from the coinage of the Saur\u0101shtran Satraps.\n\nI cannot determine whether this type was struck earlier or later than the type next to be described.\n\nVIKRAM\u0100DITYA TYPE.\n\nObv.

Ant. vol. vi. p. 57, and vol. xiv. p. 66.\n\nThe coins of this type are almost as rare as those of the Vikram\u00e2nka type. The association of the Sult\u00e2nganj specimen with a coin of the last Satrap of Saur\u00e2sh\u1e6dra is interesting, as supporting the inference justified by other evidence that the conquest of Saur\u00e2sh\u1e6dra was effected by Chandra Gupta II. His inscriptions in Central India must have been recorded when he was on his way to or from his conquests on the western coast. He adopted the Saur\u00e2sh\u1e6dran model for his silver coinage, but with legends to suit his own predilections. The title Vikram\u00e2ditya is found on his Umbrella gold coins, which I suppose to be the latest of his gold issues, and on one very rare type of his copper coinage. The extreme rarity of both types of the silver coins of Chandra Gupta II. shows that they must have been issued in small numbers, and probably near the close of his reign. The Vaish\u1e47ava epithet param\u00e2bh\u00e2gavata occurs on his Horseman gold coins, and on one variety of the Horseman to Right gold coins of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, as well as on the silver coins of both Kum\u00e2ra and Skanda Gupta.\n\nThe date 90, in the ancient form, was read by both Sir E. C. Bayley and Mr. Newton on two coins of this type, but Mr. Thomas interpreted the same character as corrupt Greek. Sir E. C. Bayley also wished to read \\(va\\) (for varshe, \u2018in the year\u2019) behind the king\u2019s head, but this reading is rejected by Mr. Fleet, who would interpret the character in question as a numeral, either 4 or 5. Mr. Fleet, however, admits that the character in front of the king\u2019s face, which has been read as 90, is doubtful, and may even be part of a marginal\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The discovery of the coin is mentioned in Arch.

There is no precedent for the engraving of one figure of the legend behind, and another before the king's head, and I do not believe that the coins of this type are dated at all.\n\nNo clear reading of a date is to be found on any of the Gupta silver coins, except those with the Fantail Peacock device.\n\nThe king's name on the Vikram\u0101ditya coins was read by Sir E. C. Bayley and Mr. Newton as Bakra. But this reading is undoubtedly erroneous. The name is Chandra, and nothing else, as correctly read by Sir A. Cunningham and Mr. Fleet. The mistaken reading was due to a slight irregularity in the form of the letters comprising the name on some specimens.\n\nKUM\u0100RA GUPTA.\n\nWINGED PEACOCK TYPE.\n\nObv.

Out of 65 coins found at Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e2d in Guzer\u00e2t, eight belonged to variety \u03b1 (J.Bo.Br.R.A.S. vol. vi. p. xlvi, 1861). A treasure of 1395 coins found at Sanand in the Sat\u00e2ra District of the Bombay Presidency consisted of about 1100 pieces of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta\u2019s Winged Peacock type (variety not stated), and of nearly 300 coins of the kings of Valabhi (ibid. pp. li and lxxi). The Th\u00e2kur of Bhaunagar in K\u00e2thi\u00e2w\u00e2r sent in nine specimens of variety \u03b1 (J.Bo.Br.R.A.S. vol. viii. p. xiii, 1867).\n\nThirteen very perfect examples were found at Ellichpur in 1851, and presented to Sir H. M. Elliot. The average weight of these coins was 29 grains, and the highest weight 32 grains, but some specimens of the type weigh 33.\n\nMr. Newton\u2019s coin, a specimen of variety \u03b2, is supposed to have the date 90, or 90 with a unit, behind the head, the numeral being preceded by a character like an iota, which is commonly found on the coins of the Satraps of Saur\u00e2sh\u1e6dra, and is conjectured to be a mint-mark (J.Bo.Br.R.A.S. vol.\nKUM\u0100RA GUPTA\u2014continued.\n\nvii. p. 3, and fig. 12 of plate; Records, p. 7, No. x*, with woodcut of obr.). But I very much doubt the correctness of the reading of this solitary date, and suspect that the supposed numeral is only a corrupt Greek letter.\n\nSome specimens of variety \u03b2 sent from K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r by Major Watson to Mr. Burgess are described and figured in Records, pp. 44, 45, and figures 11-16 of autotype plate.\u00b9 None of these have any date, nor has any specimen of the type, which I have seen.\n\nOf Mr. Burgess\u2019 coins, No. 11 has cluster of stars in lower rev. r. field; Nos. 12 and 14-16 have similar clusters in upper r. field, the stars varying in number. No. 13 is a larger coin than the others, and the king is depicted with a thick neck, and a form of earring different from that on the other coins.\n\nIt may reasonably be conjectured that the variety \u03b1 coins with the inferior title r\u0101j\u0101dhir\u0101ja were struck earlier than the variety \u03b2 pieces, and it is possible that Kum\u0101ra Gupta struck the former as Viceroy for his father, but there is no independent evidence that he ever was Viceroy. The supposed tradition published by Major Watson is known to be a forgery.\n\nMr. Fleet reads the concluding word of the legend as Mahendr\u0101ditya, and this reading is no doubt correct for many coins. But the earlier reading Mahendrasya is supported by three coins in the British Museum. The use of the genitive agrees with the form of legend on Chandra Gupta\u2019s Vikram\u0101n\u012bka coins. The title Mahendr\u0101ditya has not yet been met with on the gold coins.\n\nIn addition to the references given above, notices of coins of this type will be found in A.A. pl. xv. 17, 18; J.A.S.B. vol. xxiv. p. 505; J.R.A.S. vol. XII. (o.s.) p. 65, Pl. II. 39-42; and P.E. vol. ii. p. 96, pl. xxxvii. 16, 17.\n\nThese coins seem to occur only in the Bombay Presidency. The coins figured by Prinsep came from Kachchh.\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Burgess has recently presented these coins to the B.M.\nKUM\u0100RA GUPTA\u2014continued.\n\nTrident Type.\n\nObv.

From K\u00e2thi\u00e2w\u00e2r (J.Bo.Br R.A.S. vol. vii. p. 10, and fig. 11 of plate).\n\nThis type is known only from the coin published by Mr. Newton, and rests on his authority. The trident, as engraved in his plate, is distinct. It is possible that the title ought to be read Mahendr\u0101ditya. Similar tridents are found on the coins of Senapati Bha\u1e6d\u0101rka, and the other princes of Valabhi, who succeeded the Guptas in K\u00e2thi\u00e2w\u00e2r (Saur\u0101sh\u1e6dra).\n\nThere are three trident coins in the Bodleian collection, but I did not make out the legends, and the coins probably belong to the Valabhi series.\n\nFantail Peacock Type.\n\nObv.

Rep. vol. ix. p. 24, pl. v. 6, 7; Ind. Ant. vol. xiv. p. 66).\n\nThe Fantail Peacock coins, both of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta and Skanda Gupta, were evidently, like the gold and copper coinages, minted in Northern India. They are tolerably common in the North-Western Provinces, but are rare elsewhere. Sir. A. Cunningham informs me that they are most commonly obtained at Benares, Ajodhya, Mathur\u00e2, and places near those cities. A considerable number have been found near Sah\u00e2ranpur, and at B\u00fbriy\u00e2 on the Jumna. The late Mr. Thomas possessed six specimens of Kum\u00e2ra's coinage, procured mostly at Kanauj (Records, p. 50, figs. 22, 23 of autotype plate); Colonel Stacy had six, and Mr. Freeling seven, all probably collected within the North-Western Provinces (J.A.S.B. vol. xxiv. p. 512).\n\nThe type is also described and illustrated in P.E. vol. i. p. 338, pl. xxvii. 10-12; and J.R.A.S. Vol. XII. (o.s.) Pl. II. It is very poorly represented in the British Museum collection, but I have no doubt that numerous specimens exist in private cabinets.\n\nThe Greek legend is altogether wanting in all the coins with this Fantail Peacock device. The peacock is represented much in the same way as in variety \u03b2 of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta's gold Peacock coins. The device on the silver coins of Skanda Gupta, Budha Gupta, Bh\u00eemasena, Toram\u00e2na, and Is\u00e2na Varman (Arch. Rep. vol. ix. pp. 25-27), is a repetition of that on the silver coins of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, and the reverse legend on all these coins also is substantially the same.\n\nThe weight of the best-preserved specimens is between 35 and 36 grains, but ordinary specimens weigh about 30 grains.\nKUM\u00c2RA GUPTA\u2014continued.\n\nThe dates are recorded in the ancient Indian notation, which employed separate symbols for each of the hundreds, tens, and units, the meaning of which was independent of position. But on the coins the symbol for 100 is always placed first, then the symbol for the decade, and then the unit, and they are arranged vertically thus, \\( \\frac{100}{4} = 144 \\). The forms of the numerals do not agree exactly with those used on stone and copper inscriptions, or on the coins of the Satraps of Saur\u00e2shtra, but the symbols on the Gupta coins can be read by the aid of Pandit Bhagvanl\u00e2l Indraji's table in Ind. Ant. vol. vi. p. 42.\n\nThe dates refer to the so-called Gupta era, of which the year 1 corresponded to A.D. 320-21, old style.\n\nThe dates hitherto recognized on the coins of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta are 121, 124, 128, 129, and 130. The Mayhew coin in the B.M. seems to me to be dated in 135, and a coin from the Prinsep collection, wt. 35\u00b78 (Fig. 56 of Pl. II. J.R.A.S. Vol. XII. o.s.), seems to bear the same date.\n\nSKANDA GUPTA.\n\nWinged Peacock Type.\n\nObv. Head of king to r., as usual, but rudely executed. Two crescents on cap.

Device in a few coins is the same as that of the Winged Peacock coins of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, and is plainly a bird. Much more commonly it is a rude diagram, which is probably intended for the outline of a bird standing on a pedestal, but is so obscure that it has been called an altar.\n\nMarginal legend, vowel marks above line being omitted;\n\nVariety \u03b1.\u2014\u092a\u0930\u092e \u092d\u093e\u0917\u0935\u0924 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e\u0927\u093f\u0930\u093e\u091c \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u0941\u0902\u0926\u0941\n\u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924 \u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f, parama bh\u00e1gavata mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1dh\u00edr\u00e1ja \u015ar\u012b Skanda Gupta Kram\u00e1ditya, 'the most devout worshipper of the holy one, sovereign of Mah\u00e2r\u00e1jas, \u015ar\u012b Skanda Gupta Kram\u00e1ditya.'\n\nVariety \u03b2.\u2014As above, substituting \u0935\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f, Vikram\u00e1ditya, for \u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f, Kram\u00e1ditya, and omitting mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1dh\u00edr\u00e1ja.\n\nVariety \u03b3.\u2014As above, substituting \u092a\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f, param\u00e1ditya, for \u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f, Kram\u00e1ditya.\nSKANDA GUPTA\u2014continued.\n\nReferences and Remarks.\u2014Variety \u03b1.

Vol. XII. o.s. Pl. II., have the bird as in the coins of Kum\u0101ra Gupta. The others have the degraded device which Thomas describes as \u201ca small altar, which may be intended for the Mithraic altar of the gold coins, or for the conventional shrine of the sacred Tul\u015bi of the Hindus.\u201d The same writer observes that this device \u201cmay be traced as the distinctive emblem of the Gurjjaras successors of Skanda Gupta, and may be followed in its course on the copper-plate grants of Pras\u0101nta R\u0101ja, a monarch devoted to the worship of the sun\u201d (J.R.A.S. Vol. I. n.s. p. 262). I have not been able to verify the allusions made by Mr. Thomas, but I prefer to follow Sir A. Cunningham in regarding the obscure device in question as a corruption of the winged peacock, while admitting that the so-called altar retains little or no resemblance to a bird of any sort.\n\nThe Winged Peacock coins of Skanda Gupta of all\nSKANDA GUPTA\u2014continued.\n\nvarieties are remarkable for their extremely rough execution. Few of them approach a circle in form, and many are little more than fragments. The letters of the legends, however, are in high relief, and easily legible, though formed in a very irregular and careless fashion. The weight of these coins is necessarily very uneven, and varies from 22\u00b75 to 33 grains.\n\nThe occurrence of the title Vikram\u0101ditya in association with the name of Skanda Gupta is interesting, because that title was more specially appropriated by Chandra Gupta II. But there is no doubt whatever as to the reading of the word Vikram\u0101ditya on the ten coins in the British Museum. The specimen figured has the legend \u015ar\u012b Vikram\u0101dityya Skanda Gupta. The k in the conjunct character Sk is formed by a loop like a v attached to the lower limb of the S.\n\nEight coins in the B.M. are labelled as having the title Param\u0101ditya, but six of these (in tray No. 3) are ordinary Kram\u0101ditya coins, the word parama belonging to the epithet parama bh\u0101gavata. The last two coins in tray No. 3 appear really to have the title Param\u0101ditya (incomplete), as well as parama bh\u0101gavata.\n\nAs already noted, the Kram\u0101ditya coins at end of tray No. 3 have the reverse device distinctly in the form of a bird, as on the coins of Kum\u0101ra Gupta.\n\nOne is noteworthy for expressing medial m twice by three dots (\u2018.\u2019), and another twice expresses the same character by a single dot (.). This last coin seems to bear the legend Parama bh\u0101gavata mah\u0101kshatrapa [? Skanda] Gupta Kram\u0101ditya. The word mah\u0101kshatrapa appeared to me to be distinct. This title, which means \u2018Great Satrap,\u2019 has not yet been found on any other Gupta coin, but Kum\u0101ra Gupta perhaps used the title kshatrapa, or Satrap, on his Horseman to Left gold coins.\n\nPrinsep\u2019s specimens are said to have come from Kachchh, K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, and Guzer\u0101t. Newton observes that \u201cThe coins\nSKANDA GUPTA\u2014continued.\n\nof the Guptas do not appear to have been found in any part of the (Bombay) Presidency except Guzer\u00e2t and K\u00e2thi\u00e2w\u00e2r\u201d (J Bo.Br.R.A.S. vol. vii. p. 35); but Kachchh should be added. Out of 236 coins sent in by the Rao of Kachchh, 235 belonged to the so-called \u2018altar\u2019 type of Skanda Gupta, with the legend Para . . . \u015ar\u00ee Skanda Gupta Kram\u0101ditya (ibid. vol. vi. p. lxxviii).\n\nThe title Kram\u0101ditya occurs on the heavy (surarna) Archer type gold coins of Skanda, on the gold coins of V\u012bra Sena (?), and on certain gold coins of Kum\u0101ra, which are supposed to belong to Kum\u0101ra Gupta of the local Magadha dynasty.\n\nBull Type.\n\nObv.

Mr. Newton reads the name of the king as Rudra or Nanda. I think, however, that it is intended for Skanda Gupta, the letters being so crowded together, that only portions of them could be delineated on the coin. I should like to have read Deva Gupta; but there is a tail to the second letter on both coins, which points to nd or ndr.

Five, all dated in 174, were obtained at Benares in 1835 by Sir A. Cunningham, and the first three coins above enumerated\nBUDHA GUPTA\u2014continued.\n\nbelong to that batch. I do not know what became of the other two. The sixth specimen, which is now in Sir A. Cunningham\u2019s cabinet, was obtained at S\u0101rn\u0101th near Benares. Mr. Fleet reads the date on the Benares coins as 175, and it was wrongly read by Mr. Thomas as 155, but Sir A. Cunningham observes (loc. cit.) that \u201cthe value of the decimal is known from my Jayan\u0101th inscription, which is recorded in words as well as figures.\u201d\n\nThe inscription of Budha Gupta dated 165 is at Eran in M\u0101lw\u0101, and his territory lay between the Junna and Narbad\u0101.\u00b9 It is scarcely possible that Benares should have been subject to his authority, and the coins obtained there were probably brought by pilgrims. If carefully looked for, other specimens ought to be obtainable in Central India.\n\nSUPPLEMENT.\n\nI have described in detail all the known silver coins which can be ascribed to the Early or Imperial Gupta Dynasty. Sir A. Cunningham has described coins of certain successors of the dynasty, with similar devices and legends (Arch. Rep. vol. ix. pp. 26\u201331, pl. v. pp. 16\u201328); and in order to render my account more complete, I shall give a brief notice of these coins.\n\nBH\u012aMA SEN\u0100.\n\nFANTAIL PEACOCK TYPE.\n\nObv.

Cunningham reads 53 on his No. 19, but the 3 seems to me to be a blurred 2.\n\nThere are three similar coins with head to l. in B.M., presented by Miss Baring, on two of which the date seems to be 54, but I could not decipher the king\u2019s name. It did not appear to be Toram\u0101\u1e47a. I attach no importance to the circumstance that the king\u2019s head is turned to l. The Gupta gold series proves that it was a matter of indifference which way the king\u2019s effigy was turned.\n\n\u012a\u015a\u0100NA VARM\u0100.\n\nFANTAIL PEACOCK TYPE.\n\nObv. Head of king to l.

Two specimens, procured at Ajodhya (Ibid. pl. v. 21, 22).\n\nAll these specimens are, according to Sir A. Cunningham, dated 55, of which the interpretation is doubtful. The name was at first wrongly read \u015a\u0101nti Varma (Arch. Rep. vol.\n\n\u00b9 For the Eran inscription of the reign of Toram\u0101\u1e47a see Corpus Inscr. Ind. vol. iii. p. 158, No. 36. He is also mentioned in the Gw\u0101l\u012bor inscription of his son Mihirakula (Ibid. p. 161, No. 37.)\n\u012as\u0101\u1e47a Varm\u0101\u2014continued.\n\nxvi. pp. 79, 81). \u012as\u0101\u1e47a Varm\u0101 was one of the Maukhari, or Mukhara, dynasty, who ruled in part of Magadha, and were the rivals of the later Gupta dynasty, which ruled in another part; and he was the contemporary and opponent of the Later Kum\u0101ra Gupta, who flourished about A.D. 550. See l. 5 of Ap\u1e63ar inscription of \u0100ditya Sena in Corpus Inscr. Ind. vol. iii. p. 206.\n\nMr. Fleet examined two specimens, and observes that \"on the obv. of the coin figured by General Cunningham as No. 22, in front of the king's face there are two marks, which may perhaps be the numerical symbols for 40, 60, or 70, and 5. But they are very imperfect and doubtful.\" \"On the dated coins,\" he says, \"the head and neck of the peacock are turned to the proper right, as in the early Gupta coins; in the coin without a date, they are turned to the proper left\" (Ind. Ant. vol. xiv. p. 68).\n\nCOINS OF KINGS OF VALABHI.\n\nTrident Type.\n\nSir A. Cunningham gives a brief account of these coins in Arch. Rep. vol. ix. p. 28, pl. v. 23, 24, but they require more exhaustive examination than they have yet received. As I am not prepared to discuss them at length, I content myself with a mere reference to the published accounts. Prinsep notes that several hundred of coins of this class were found buried in the ruins of Purag\u0101r\u1e25, twenty miles west of Bhoj in Kachchh (J.A.S.B. vol. iv. p. 687). These coins were discussed by Mr. Thomas in J.A.S.B. vol. xxiv. p. 508; in his paper on the so-called S\u0101h kings in J.R.A.S. Vol. XII. (o.s.); and in P.E. vol. ii. p. 100.\n\nThe reverse device is similar to that of the unique Trident coin of Kum\u0101ra Gupta published by Mr. Newton.\n\nThe three Trident coins in the Bodleian probably belong to this class.\n? KRISHNA R\u00c2JA R\u00c2SHTRAK\u00dbTA.\n\nBull Type.\n\nObv. Rude head of king with moustaches to r.\nNo trace of either legend or date.\n\nRev. As in Bull type of Skanda Gupta. Legend in modified Gupta characters, read by Cunningham as Parama Mahesvara, Mahaditya (or Mahakshatra) padanudhyata Sri Krishna Raj\u00e2.\n\nCoins from the Nasik District, Bombay, supposed to belong to Krishna Raja Rashtrakuta, a king of the Dakhin, circa A.D. 375-400 (Arch. Rep. vol. ix. p. 30, pl. v. 26). The legends require further examination. Mr. Fleet reads parama mahesvara-matupitri-padanudhyata Sri Krishna raja, and translates, 'The glorious Krishna Raja, who is a devout worshipper of (the god) Mahesvara, (and) who meditates on the feet of (his) parents' (Ind. Ant. vol. xiv. p. 68).\n\nChapter X.\u2014Catalogue of Copper Coins.\n\nContents.\n\n| CONTENTS                  | PAGE |\n|---------------------------|------|\n| Chandra Gupta II          | 138  |\n| Kumara Gupta              | 142  |\n| Chandra                   | 143  |\n| Supplement                | 144  |\n\nCHANDRA GUPTA II.\n\n(I.)

The coins are all in more or less bad preservation, and the weights consequently give very uncertain guidance. It is, however, certain that the extant specimens belong to at least two denominations. I am unable to come to any certain conclusion as to what these denominations were. The coins of this type are common, when compared with the other Gupta copper coins. I suspect that many exist in private collections, for such minute and ill-preserved coins are not readily recognized. I found one among the unclassed coins in the Bodleian cabinet.\n\nKUM\u00c2RA GUPTA.\n\nUmbrella Type.\n\nObv. As in Umbrella type of Chandra Gupta II.\n\nRev. Ditto, but the initial letter of the king's name appears to be \\( K \\), the rest of the name is lost.\n\nReferences and Remarks.\n\nThe existence of this type of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta's coinage is perhaps doubtful, and rests on a single very imperfect specimen in the possession of Sir A. Cunningham, who procured it at Ahichchhatra (R\u00e2mnagar) in the Barcli District, N.W.P. The last letter of the defaced legend is the first letter of the king's name, and certainly seems to be a \\( K \\), and nothing else. I have examined it several times, and do not see how it possibly can be a damaged \\( Ch \\). If the initial letter of the name was \\( K \\), as it apparently is, the name must have been Kum\u00e2ra. The syllables \\( r\u00e2ja S'ri \\) before the damaged name are quite plain.\n\nThe coin is in such bad preservation that I have not attempted to have it photographed.\nKUM\u0100RA GUPTA.\n\nSTANDING KING TYPE.\n\nObv. Device as in Standing King type of Chandra Gupta II. The king wears a dhoti, or waistcloth, the folds of which are indicated. No legend.\n\nRev. Bird (Garu\u1e0da) as in coins of Chandra Gupta II. Legend in exergue \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0930 \u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924, \u015ar\u012b Kum\u0101ra Gupta.\n\nReferences and Remarks.\n\nB. No. 751. Collected by Tregear, probably at Ajodhya. Unique. Note the modern form of d. An eye-copy of the legend is given in the annexed woodcut:\n\nThis is the only copper coin which we can affirm with certainty to have been struck as such by Kum\u0101ra Gupta. Sir A. Cunningham's specimen of his Umbrella type is doubtful. The copper coins of Kum\u0101ra Gupta and Skanda Gupta found in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, which resemble the silver coinage, and are noticed subsequently, may be ancient forgeries.\n\nCHANDRA.\n\nVASE TYPE.\n\nObv. The name \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930 Chandra inscribed horizontally across the field. In the smaller coins a crescent above the name.\n\nRev. A short-necked broad vase, with streamers proceeding from it, or vertical lines on each side. No legend. In two sizes.\n\n(1) Larger size.\n\nA.C. Wt. 13. (J.A.S.B. vol. xxxiv. p. 125, pl. xviii. 20.)\n\n(2) Smaller size.\n\nA.C. No. 1. A flower? above vase, and a vertical line on each side of vase, in lieu of streamers. Crescent above name. Wt. 7. Diameter .42. In poor condition. (Plate IV. Fig. 16.)\n\nA.C. No. 2. Similar, but in worse condition, and indistinct. Wt. 5.5.\n\nA.C. No. 3. Very minute, in bad condition. Wt. 3.5. Diameter .3. This coin and No. 2 seem to have streamers from mouth of vase. One is figured as figure 21 in J.A.S.B. loc. supra eit.\nCHANDRA\u2014continued.\n\nThe identity of the Chandra named on these coins is uncertain. He may be the Chandra, who recorded the inscription on the Iron Pillar at Delhi. Sir A. Cunningham supposed him to be Chandra Gupta II., but the coins in question are quite different from those of the Guptas, and are related to the coins of the N\u00e2ga dynasty and of Pa\u015bupati of Nep\u00e2l (described in J.A.S.B. loc. sup. cit.). The Pa\u015bupati coins with similar vases are found in Nep\u00e2l.\n\nThe Chandra coins are in poor preservation, and I cannot determine their standard, but they certainly occur in two sizes. Some specimens of the smaller size are in the cabinet of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.\n\nSupplement.\n\nUncertain.\n\nMr. Theobald has a small copper coin, weighing 25 grains, with the legend -\u0926\u094d\u0930 [or \u0926\u094d\u0930] \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940, -ndra [or -dra] Mah\u00e2r\u00e2ja \u015ar\u00ee, which may possibly belong to Chandra Gupta II., but the coin is in very bad preservation, and it is impossible to assign it.\n\nA copper coin, with traces of gilding, in possession of Mr. H. Rivett-Carnac, appears to be an ancient forgery of the common variety of the Archer gold coins of Chandra Gupta II.\n\nCopper Coins of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta and Skanda Gupta, agreeing in Device and Legend with the Silver Coins.\n\nThe following notes record all that I can discover concerning the copper Gupta coins, which resemble the silver coinage. They may all be ancient forgeries, but, if they are, it is odd that such a considerable number of them should be found. The question of their genuineness deserves fuller examination than I have been able to give it. Some are certainly forgeries.\n\n1 Corpus Inscr. Ind. vol. iii. The name used to be read Bh\u00e2va or Dh\u00e2va.\nCoins presented by the Thakur of Morvi, and exhibited at the meeting of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society on the 11th July, 1867, by the President, the Honourable Mr. Justice Newton.\n\n\"Four copper Gupta coins. Searcely any portion of the legend is visible, but I recognize the coins as Skanda Gupta's\" (p. xiv).\n\nAt the same meeting Mr. Newton also exhibited the following coins:\n\n\"Presented by the Chief of Walla.\n\nTwenty copper coins of one of the Gupta kings, probably Kum\u00e2ra, though scarcely a letter of the legend is left on any of them. The thin film of silver, with which some of them were originally covered, is still to be seen, and they thus add to the evidence which we already possess that the introduction of coinage did not long precede the idea of making it a means of fraud\" (p. xv).\n\n\"The President also presented to the Society, on behalf of Captain Watson, Political Agent in K\u00e2thi\u00e2w\u00e2r, fifteen small copper coins, on which he remarked that sufficient of the legend remained to enable him to identify them as the coinage of Kum\u00e2ra Gupta, the complete legend being Parama Bh\u00e1gavata, R\u00e1j\u00e2dhv\u00e2r\u00e1 Kum\u00e2ra Gupta Mahendrasya.\"\n\nThese coins, he added, were evidently a portion of the same hoard as those sent by the Chief of Wall\u00e2, and Captain Watson stated that they formed part of a number dug up on the site of the ancient city of Valabhi.\n\nCaptain Watson's letter accompanying the coins was as under:\n\n\"I send you herewith some small copper coins found at Wall\u00e2\u2014a tolerably large hoard was dug up on the site of the ancient city of Valabhi. I have got eight besides those I send you, which I have given to two natives of K\u00e2thi\u00e2w\u00e2r, to see if they can decipher any of the marks. I will send you the eight referred to shortly. Five of those I send are in pretty good preservation for copper coins. The rest have scarcely any marks left to decipher\u2014a crescent or moon is very distinct on some of them. I trust during the rains to be able to procure more\" (p. xviii).\u00b9\n\nIn the same volume Mr. Newton describes a copper coin\n\n\u00b9 Bo.Br.J.R.A.S. vol. ix. pp. xiv, xv, xviii.\nof Sw\u00e2m\u00ee Chashtana, father of Jaya D\u00e2m\u00e2, which belonged to Dr. Bhau D\u00e2j\u00ee. The coin resembles the earlier ones of the so-called S\u00e2h kings. The obverse head is more finely executed than usual, and the legend, which ran all round the margin, as in some of the Bactrian hemidraehms, though illegible, caused Mr. Newton to \"think that some at least of the Greek letters were correctly cut.\" The reverse devices consist of a wavy line with three-lobed chaitya emblem, a sun of sixteen rays, and two crescent moons.\n\n\"The weight of the coin is twenty-three grains, but several grains have been lost by chemical change and cleaning. The legend on the reverse is accurately copied in the figure, but I regret that I am unable to decipher it entirely. The whole, however, with the exception of the four letters enclosed below in brackets, may be read with certainty:\n\n\"R\u00e2jno Mah\u00e2kshatrapasa (Syamo?) tika putrasa Chashtanasa (dala?) rumna\" (sic).\n\nCunningham points out (ibid. p. cix) that on the right half of the coin the ruler's name is repeated in Ario-P\u00e2li, as Chashtanasa. \"The Indian and Aryan names are brought together.\"\n\nCunningham and Newton were certain as to the Arian name on a coin of Nahapana, but were not quite certain about the name of Chashtana in the Arian character.\n\nI presume that this copper coin of Chashtana was the model of the copper coins of Kum\u00e2ra and Skanda Gupta referred to above, if they are not merely forgeries of the silver coinage. Dr. Bhau D\u00e2j\u00ee also possessed two copper coins of Jaya D\u00e2m\u00e2 (ibid. p. xxv).\n\nThe British Museum has several specimens of minute copper coins resembling the silver in type. All are in bad condition. The only one at all decipherable has on obv. the usual head, rudely executed, and on rev. remains of a (?) trident, and distinct legend Gupta Mahendr\u00e2-d[iya]. It must be assigned to Kum\u00e2ra. The copper is good colour, and shows no sign of plating.\n\n1 Ibid. p. 4, and fig. 4 of unnumbered plate, 'On Recent Additions to our Knowledge of the Ancient Dynasties of Western India.'\n## Contents of the Plates of Coins\n\n| Plate | Figure | Metal | Reign | Type and Variety | Reference |\n|-------|--------|-------|-------|-----------------|-----------|\n| I.    | 1      | N     | Chandra Gupta I. | King and Queen | B.M., purchased |\n|       | 2      | \"     | Samudra Gupta | Tiger | Eden |\n|       | 3      | \"     | (?)

Mr. Rapson has pointed out to me that the epithet pratiratha, like pratihasta, is used simply in the sense of 'opponent,' and that apratiratha should be translated as 'he who has no rival.' This correction is to be applied wherever the word apratiratha occurs.\n\n56, n. 2, add. In Wilson's trans. of act ii. of the Mudr\u0101-R\u0101k\u1e63asa the three names Kusumapura, Pushpapura, and P\u0101taliputra are used indifferently. (Specimens of Theatre of the Hindus, 3rd ed. ii. 178-179.)\n\n81. Dr. Hoernl\u00e9 informs me that he has seen a Class II. A. Archer coin (apparently one belonging to Mr. Rivett-Carnac), on which the reverse goddess, instead of having her legs crossed in the usual way, has the l. knee raised with her elbow resting on it. Mon. a variety of 8a.\n\n89. Dr. Hoernl\u00e9 informs me that a Combatant Lion coin of Chandra Gupta II. obtained by Mr. Rivett-Carnac either in Oudh or a neighbouring district, has on the l. obv. the legend [\u092d]\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939\u0927\u093e\u092e\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930, [bh\u0101]dra si\u1e41ha\u1e25dh\u0101mhit\u1e5b, 'the valiant, who is clever in the slaying of lions.' The portion of the legend, about half, on the r. obv. is lost. Mon. 8a. I presume that the nasal in si\u1e41ha, which Dr. Hoernl\u00e9 gives as anusv\u0101ra, is really the guttural \u1e47, as in the case of other coins.\nArt. II.\u2014Indian Names for English Tongues. By W. F. Sinclair, Bomb.C.S.\n\nA glance at the List of Members of this Society shows a number of Oriental names from every country between the Danube and the Pacific, which is, in itself, a matter for congratulation. A second will suggest a doubt as to the proper style in which to address one or two of their owners; and a detailed examination is enough, like Colonel Bowie's tooth-pick, \"to give a timid man the colic.\" The fact is, that we have not yet acquired a system by which we can index these names so as to know at a glance the proper written or spoken address of an Oriental.\n\nI can, myself, guess at some of the Indian names; and I propose to record some rough observations on the personal nomenclature of Western India; especially of the Maratha-speaking races; illustrating the same by a fancy history of Gomaji bin Timaji Powar, who fills up blanks in the same way as John Doe and Richard Roe did in English law (or law-English).\n\nTo begin with, this gentleman's personal name\u2014Christian name as we should say\u2014is Goma. He has only one; the practice of heaping up names, so familiar to the Royal and noble families of Europe, is not Indian. Like nearly all true Maratha names, it ends in a vowel, and this vowel is subject to inflection, for the purpose of tacking on to it little respectful tails. If Goma be born in a low caste, he will probably become at once Gomy\u00e1, and may remain so all his life.\n\nWe will suppose him, however, to adopt a step which (in India) at once raises his position, namely, to \"take the belt,\" or, as we should say, \"take the Queen's shilling.\" Having done this, he is a soldier and a gentleman, in a modest way, and only great intimacy will justify any one\nin calling him *Gomy\u00e1* any longer. If he is, as above suggested, a Parw\u00e1ri, that is, belongs to a caste obliged by custom to live outside the walls of the village (most Maratha villages are walled, and all have a known boundary), he becomes *Gomnak*; as *n\u00e1k* is the proper addition of respect for a Parw\u00e1ri.\n\n*Gomnak* may rise to a commission and a title, always in a modest way. The Bombay Army list is full of him, and he can stand fire beside the descendants of gods and luminaries; but it is not his way to join learned Societies, and no further courtesy is available for him in his own language. So we may leave him for the present, and attend to *Gomaji bin Timaji*, who is, *ex supposito*, a true Maratha.\n\nIf above the very poorest class, he is already in enjoyment of the respectable particle *ji*; if a little better off, or known, though poor, to be of a good house, he is as likely to be *rao*. This is one of the innumerable forms of the root that we find in Raja, etc. It is sometimes the title of a sovereign prince, as in the case of the Rao of Kuteh. In certain places where true Marathas are scarce, and hold their heads up as a peasant nobility, the word *Rao* becomes a synonym for \"Maratha.\" This is particularly the ease in the North Konkan, where, if you want baggage coolies, you may be told \"this is a village of *raos*,\" *i.e.* of gentlemen who, though in poor circumstances, will not carry your kit on their heads.\n\nAlthough, therefore, *ji* and *rao* are a good deal mixed up, and even interchanged, the latter is the more respectable handle; and if *Gomaji* gets on in the world, he will probably become, at least in courteous correspondence, *Gomajirao*. Besides the terminations mentioned, there is a fifth, *ba*, which has much the same force as *ji*.\n\nTo sum up. If you hear a man called *Goma* or *Gomya*, you know that he is a poor devil to whom it is not worth while to be civil; *ba* and *ji* are respectable in a \"plain but honest\" sort of way, and may often get into very good society; but *rao* implies good blood or improved circumstances.\n\nThe choice of names is determined in various ways. Well-\nto-do people and high-caste men, however poor, have a horoscope drawn at their birth; and the name or its initial letter is apt to be fixed by the presiding clergy or astrologers (who are a branch of the clergy). In such families, too, it is usual to find at least as much theology as enables its head to say whether he is a Saiva or a Vaishnava, i.e. whether he considers Siva or Vishnu to be the chief form of Omnipotence; and in that case the boy\u2019s name will be one of the thousand aliases of the favourite god.\n\nThus, in the Royal house of Bhonsla, who are Saivas, you find such names as Sivaji and Sambhaji; in a Vaishnava family you will find Vitoba and Lakshman. Commonly, two names will alternate, the eldest son being named after his grandfather, so that Balcantrao (as good a name as Percival or Lancelot) begets Pandoba, who begets another Balcantrao. This last, to avoid confusion, may very likely be called Baloba, as we modify a second Alexander in a house into Alick, or Horatio the second into Horace, and so on.\n\nAnother way of distinguishing people is to give them mere conversational names; they are not nicknames, that is, they are not disrespectful. I know a man whose real name is Manajirao Raghojirao Angr\u00e9, but he is always addressed as Dada Saheb; and Maratha history shows us three famous Nana Sahebs, not one of whom had a real name which could by any process be twisted into anything like that shape.\n\nThese \u2018sobriquets\u2019 are easily recognized by generally containing the word Saheb, or a term of relationship, like Kaka, Mama, Dada, Nana, more rarely Bhau. They are used in conversation and familiar correspondence. If imported into serious writing for the purpose of distinction, the word urf (=alias) is used to indicate their nature, thus, Manajirao Raghojirao urf Dada Saheb Angr\u00e9.\n\nTo return to Gomaji. The second word of his name, bin, simply means \u2018son of,\u2019 and is borrowed from the Musalmans, like the urf just quoted. It is very often omitted, especially in the case of good families and high\ncastes, and is sometimes replaced by the equally Musalman *walad*, meaning the same thing. Very particular clerks use *bin* for Marathas (rarely for Brahmans), *walad* for Musalmans and low castes, in official documents; but in writing a native name in English the best way is simply to make the father's name follow the son's. In this case *Timaji* is the father's name, and requires no further remark, except, perhaps, that some castes do most perversely reverse the order, and put the father's name first. Such a case, however, is altogether outside of our line of business.\n\nThe fourth word *Povar* is very important, being the surname, and in the present case also the name of the *kul* or clan. Marathas, and most people who speak Maratha, always use such surnames, and very often, as here, the surname is that of the clan, as in Ireland or Scotland we have Gallagher or Cameron. But a Maratha may use a surname quite distinct from the clan-names, just as in a purely Gaelic community *Shamus Roe* might be a 'boy of the Gallaghers,' or *Callum McIan* 'A man of Lochiel's.' The clan-name in such a case underlies the accidental surname; and among the Marathas its memory is often revived in every generation, especially at marriages, as the race is exogamous, and marriage within the *kul* is wrong.\n\nThe particular clan now in question, that of *Povar*, claims identity with one of the best Rajput tribes, and many of its members are well able to 'look the part.' Its best family in the Deccan, however, goes by the surname of *Nimbalkar*, whose terminal syllable *kar* at once marks it as a local or professional name, in this case (and commonly) the former. Sometimes there are two surnames of different origin, but this is rare. The best-known instance is that of the house of *Ghatge* of K\u00e1gal (K\u00e1galkar), which may be paralleled in Scotland by such a term as 'Cameron of Lochiel.' This family has again a title attached to its chieftainship, *Sharza Rao*, which may be translated 'Lord Lyon,' as a *Sharza* is a sort of conventional lion, known chiefly to sculptors. Such titles belong only to a few great families, and are\ntraced to ancient royal grants, or held by mere prescription, corresponding, in some degree, to such Gaelic honours as those of the O'Conor Don and Mac Callum More, or more closely to the Scottish Mhor-ar-chat, said to be translateable as 'Big Tom.'\n\nUsually they are so very like common personal names as to create great confusion. A former Sharza Rao, who played a great figure in the Maratha history of the early Eighteen Hundreds, did confound his historians nearly as much as his enemies; and I was long perplexed myself by a living gentleman whose personal name is Anandrao Putlaji, but his proper style Dalpatrao Sardeshmukh. It is as if we should make 'Sir John' or 'Lord Thomas' an hereditary title. But so natural does it seem to a Western Indian mind, that the first Parsee baronet, whose own name was Jamsetji and his father's name Jijibhai (Jeejeebhoy), got those two names entailed with his title, so that each successor adopts them, abandoning, on accession, his own name that has answered him up to that time. It may have been Cursetjee or Jehangir. Whereby not only is the memory of the founder kept green, but the family have got nearly rid of their real surname, which is Bottlewalla, derived from the skill and honesty wherewith their ancestors did put beer into bottles. A good many Parsi surnames are characteristic enough. Bottlewalla is closely followed by Bottlebhoy (meaning presumably the same thing) and Ginwalla. The 'Gin' in this last, however, is not drinkable, but a cotton-gin. There is a fine old commercial flavour about 'Ready-money, and Antia means an exchange broker. Some families have adopted English surnames, such as Ashburner, presumably those of old patrons. This last custom is by no means confined to the Parsees. Not only do the lowest castes adopt the most dignified tribal names, but even Brahmins will take up those of princes of lower caste than themselves. A Brahman family named Biwalkar, in the service of the Pirate Dynasty of Angre, adopted their name, and I could multiply instances. This is the more convenient to Brahmins, as they cannot well use the names of their\ngotras, or tribes, for this purpose. A Western Brahman, though his gotra be no secret, will not knock its name about in ordinary conversation or correspondence. It is too sacred a thing for that. Sometimes there is a touch of totemism about the tribes. Many are named after animals or plants, and at least one clan, the Shelars, are said to abstain from the meat of the she-goat (Shela), though the connection of the words is probably an afterthought. S\u00e1lunke, the Maratha equivalent for the ancient Chalukya, and modern Rajput Solanki, means a maina-bird (Acridotheres tristis), and Sinde (commonly called Sindia) means a wild date palm.\n\nIn addition to these old family names and titles, we have a lot of more or less official handles to names.\n\nRajas and Maharajas are not very common in Western India; and no native Government has adopted the northern practice of bestowing these titles on subjects, which the Government of India has to some small extent continued in Upper India, from Mogul and Sikh times. Only in one case perhaps has such a thing been done on the Bombay side, when the title of Maharaja was conferred on the Thakur of Bhavnagar, whose original status was very nearly that of Freiherr under the old German empire.\n\nA good many of the old Maratha chiefs, called Deshmukhs and Desais, or \u2018lords of districts,\u2019 survive. Some of these have become Rajas; most of them are now mere country nobles, and of these last some are Musalmans, descendants either of invaders or of old stocks that saved their position by changing their faith. In the same way many of the hereditary managers of districts, called Deshpande, remain in the same condition, associated with their downfall, as once with their power.\n\nIt was the highly centralized Maratha kingdom that broke them down, substituting the rule of royal prefects, and we found them long past cure as a governing agency. They still, however, exercise some social sway by consent and courtesy, and are always addressed by their titles, which have, moreover, become surnames for the branches of their families, more common than such names as Duke,\nMayor, or Earle amongst us, or Le Comte and Le Duc in France.\n\nThe British Government, as we know, distributes orders in European fashion, and the use of them is regulated by European custom. Besides this, it defines the proper use of the term Esquire, with a liberality that has removed it from the list of things worth quarrelling about, and its University degrees, again, follow English rule.\n\nThe titles of Rao Saheb and Rao Bahadur (in Upper India Rai Saheb and Rai Bahadur) are bestowed upon deserving Hindus, generally official, or attached to particular offices. If the person to be honoured is a Musalman or Parsi, the word Kh\u00e1n is substituted for Rao. In either case these titles precede the rest of the name, and are commonly used in addressing their owner. But when a native soldier receives the title of Bahadur or Sirdar Bahadur, it is written after his name, and is well worthy of note, for these military honours contain no perversion of words. Bahadur means 'a hero,' and Sirdar a 'commander,' and the appropriate style and implied honourable service, render them alone, of all Indian honours, secure from the scoff of the least reverent joker.\n\nAs an illustration, we will suppose our friend Gomaji to have attained to one of these, and index him under P, as Powar, Subadar (captain) Gomaji Timaji, Sirdar Bahadur; and below him, to show the difference, we will enter a Brahman magistrate by an imaginary but possible style, Pantambekar, the Rao Bahadur Krishnarao Lakshmanrao, M.A. Bombay, C.I.E.; then a lesser light in the same way of business and caste, R\u00e1ste, Shankarrao Mahadeorao, Esq., B.A. Bombay; and a scholar, S\u00e1ne, Pandit Ramchandra Trimbak.\n\nIt will be seen that the military rank, the civil title, and the native term Pandit, all exclude the 'Esquire'; the last has pretty nearly the original and correct meaning of Doctor; and although it is not protected by any law, native scholars would not recognize the right to it of any person who had not been properly trained, and admitted\nto it by an older Pandit or Pandits, pretty much as in the Middle Ages any Knight could confer knighthood upon good cause shown and with due ceremony.\n\nThe styles of ladies are simple enough. They generally take the name of a goddess, as the men do of a god; and one goddess, Bhow\u00e1ni, gives names to both sexes, in the same way as we sometimes find the names Marie and Anne amongst those of men in France and Spain. They have, too, a choice amongst stars, flowers, and gems, and some names: T\u00e1r\u00e1, Hir\u00e1, Ail\u00e1, Jiw\u00e1, are very pretty.\n\nTo these is added the syllable bai (=lady), and in some families a detestable suffix aw, which turns the sweetest name into a sound fit only for the mouth of a cat, and is happily rare. To the proper name is added the husband\u2019s name and surname, with the connective kom, as Tarabai kom Gomaji Powar. Sometimes the kom is displaced by the Musalman form aurat, or in the case of widows (and by very punctilious scribes) by Aya.\n\nChildren have no distinctive styles. In a country where all young ladies are married almost in the cradle, there is of course no word for \u2018Miss,\u2019 and indeed, above the gutter, there are no children in India, only little men and women, preternaturally solemn, and (before company) well-behaved and pretty. The way in which they fall off when they stop growing makes me never see them without thinking of Charles Lamb\u2019s lamentation over the Eton boys; but it is to be said in their favour that they have no legs-and-wings stage.\n\nThe above remarks apply, generally, to all persons speaking Maratha, although they are far from exhausting the subject even in that language. A person conversant with it will generally make a pretty good guess, from the personal and surnames, at their owner\u2019s caste and family religion, or rather sect, and often at a good many other details. If you want his local habitation, you should define it by village (or rather parish), taluka (subdivision), and district. Post towns are not yet sufficiently abundant to suffice for this purpose; but with name, father\u2019s name, and surname, village, taluka, and district, you can find any man. We will suppose\nGomaji to be wanted by the military authorities when on furlough, and they will request the collector of the district to communicate with \"Gomaji bin Timaji Powar, (village) Pali, (taluka) Mh\u00e1d, in the Kolaba District.\" At least that is what they ought to do. What they do in fact is very often to send one a kind of conundrum made up of nicknames and impossibilities, but as the causes of error are limited, and known to old hands, some single recognizable word generally furnishes a clue to the riddle, and it is a very rare thing for Gomaji not to be found or accounted for in the long run.\n\nLiving amongst these Maratha-speaking races are a vast number of immigrants, and on their borders are two other great languages, the Gujarati and the Canarese. Amongst these the personal nomenclature is by no means so well fixed as in Maratha, but they do all generally use one personal name, and add that of the father. Surnames, though not unknown, are in much less common use in the Canarese districts, and the polite terminations are different. The commonest perhaps is appa, so that here Gomaji Timaji becomes Gomappa Timappa. I have not sufficient knowledge of this region to pursue the subject further.\n\nIn Gujarat, amongst the trading and purely agricultural classes, you still find the ji, but it is on its promotion, and stands as high as rao amongst Marathas. The commoner terminations are ram, chand; and das.\n\nSurnames are hardly used by these people, although the father's name still follows the son's; the connecting particle bin is very rare, so that our friend becomes, probably, Gomaram Timaram, or Gomchand Timchand; the consonant before chand dropping its vowel, or slurring over it.\n\nBeside the settled races there are a great number of Rajputs, Kattis, aboriginal Kolis, and half-breds. These use tribal or subtribal names, the hybrid races invariably adopting those of the nobler stock, and 'making believe very much indeed' to be Rajputs. They have a singular practice of putting the tribal name first; the personal name very often ends in sing, which in the local Doric becomes\nsang, and the ji has here become the most honourable of small handles, as in Solanki Jaswantsangji Ramsangji. Here the first word is the tribal name, the second the personal, and the third the father's name. Accidental surnames are here rare, except amongst graduates of the Bombay University, which insists on or encourages their adoption for the facility of indexing its lists; consequently they are got up for the occasion. I knew one gentleman who adopted that of 'Truth-teller.'\n\nThere are, however, a considerable number of small titles; the commonest of these, perhaps, is Girassia or Grasia, which has been derived from the Latin grassare, but really means that the bearer has received or inherited a royal grant of a village to stop his mouth (gr\u00e1s), and is, in short, a feudal tenant, probably a tribesman of the grantor. If he be a near kinsman, he is called both in the singular and plural Bhayad; the word, however, is properly plural, meaning 'the brotherhood,' or, as we should say, the 'Blood Royal.' The terms Girassia and Bhayad overlap, and where used as titles precede the personal name; however, they are inherited by every male, and the former has almost come to be synonymous with the caste-name Rajput, because almost every Rajput in Gujarat is, or thinks he should be, a Girassia, and every Girassia is, or thinks himself, a Rajput. They are, therefore very inconvenient words, and breed much confusion, but are too common to be passed over.\n\nThakur, a very common title, may be translated 'Baron.' In the same way as Girassia, it has, in part of Upper India, come to be almost synonymous with Rajput; and in Gujarat (usually under the form Thakardd) it is applied to a set of half-Kolis who would like to be thought Rajputs. It is also the name of a forest tribe further south. But, taken as a title, it does mean the lord of a small territory, who is as independent as he can make himself, and, under favourable circumstances, may, as in the Bhaunagar case, be compared to the old German Freiherr, whose territory was a \"poor thing, but his own.\" In such a case, however, the natural thing is for the petty sovereign either to be swallowed\nup, or to become something bigger, and take a bigger title. The smaller Thakurs, who have altogether failed in maintaining a sovereign condition, are called Talukdars in Gujarat, but this is the name of their tenure, and not a title used in addressing them. (In other parts of India it is an official title.) I gather that most persons addressed as 'Thakur' in Upper India belong to this class. Perhaps the Scottish term 'Laird' would be a better translation than 'Baron.'\n\nThe title-list of Gujarati, however, is heraldry run mad, or enough to drive a herald mad. One chief is called a Raj, and addressed as Raj Saheb. Another is a Rao; the next a Jam; and then follow Ranas, Rawals, and Ravats, 'et omne quod incipit in R\u00e1.' To mend matters there are a couple of Nawabs, one Diwan, and a ruler commonly known as the Babi. No rules can be laid down for this confusion, the only thing to do is to learn them off by heart.\n\nOutside of these Hindu systems and choases stands the Musalman nomenclature, which, when not complicated by titles, is simple enough. A Musalman, when admitted to the faith, receives commonly one name, which may be simple, as Ali or Muhammad, or a compound expressing generally his devotion to Allah (under one of his 99 names), to the Prophet, or, especially if he be a Shia, to Ali. There will be some local variety in pronunciation, especially in the 'joints,' so to speak, of a compound name. For instance, Abd is a very common beginning, and means 'servant.' If you want to call your son 'the servant of the Merciful' he may be Abd'al Rahm\u00e1n or Abdu'l Rahim\u00e1n. But he is pretty sure to be addressed by Hindus, Christians, and unlearned Musalmans as Abdul tout court, which is absurd, and lucky for him if it is not shortened into Abbu. However, in good Arabic writing, he will get his full name, and then his father's, connected with a bin or Ibn, and so on for as many generations backward as time and knowledge stretch to. The genealogy in the first chapter of St. Matthew is the best example; but most Arabs have to stop some way on this side of Adam; and when they do, they top off the pile of ancestors with the tribal name.\nIn Indian official writing of a common Moslem we give his own name and his father's name, and then stop, as Indian Musalmans do not usually deal much in surnames.\n\nWhen you get into Persian court titles, there is nothing for it but to put your knuckles in your eyes and run to the nearest Munshi. There are, however, a few short ones in common use that I may take up here.\n\n*Khan* was originally the title of an hereditary Chief of a Tartar tribe, and is still correctly so used by the Osmanli Turks, who have only one *Khan*, whom we commonly call 'The Sultan.' The further east you go, the lower in the mud does this title sink; until, in India, any one above the degree of a horse-boy may use it. In that country, however, it usually implies a claim to Path\u00e1n (Afghan) descent. This title always follows the personal name, like the Hindu *ji*, *rao*, etc., but is written separately. So does *Beg*, which is rare, confined to a few families, generally respectable, having more or less claim to a Persian or Tartar origin.\n\n*Sheikh*, though originally the proper title of an Arab chief, is now even cheaper than *Khan*; and, though people talk of \"the Sheikhs being descended from the Khalif Umar,\" it really means in India that the bearer is respectable enough to require some small handle to his name, and cannot grab a better one.\n\n*Sayad*, *Saiyyid*, or roughly *Syad*, means that the bearer is descended from the Prophet, or would like to be thought such. But the term has got so vulgarized that there is nothing surprising in finding the name given to a domestic servant or messenger. The names *Shekh* and *Sayad* always go before the personal name, as *Khan* and *Beg* after it. All four are hereditary. A full address would be *Umar Khan walad Ali Khan*, or *Shekh Husen walad Shakh Hasan*, the *walad* being in India usually substituted for *bin*, but the use of the father's name in addition to one's own is much less general in speaking of Musalmans than in respect of Hindus.\n\n*Mirza* once meant 'Prince.' It is now used by a few\nfamilies in India, generally of good standing and Persian descent, before the personal name, and implies an hereditary claim to be a gentleman and a scholar. I never knew a Mirza who was below the caste of a schoolmaster or clerk; but of course there is no knowing what even a Mirza may come down to.\n\nMir is short, I suppose, for Amir (a commander). It is prefixed to personal names in a few families, generally noble, though not necessarily rich, and especially by all persons belonging to the late ruling clan of Sind, the Talpur Baluch. Both Mir and Mirza are used in addition to other titles, as Sayad Mir Jamal Ali walad Sayad Mir Imam Ali; or, Mirza Kasim Beg walad Mirza Tugral Beg.\n\nNawab, which was simply a polite plural of Naib (=deputy) has got up in the world, while the previous titles were tumbling down. It is now the commonest title of a Musalman sovereign prince in India, and in fact the highest, with the exception of the prince whom we call the Nizam, but who is, correctly speaking, the representative of the Viceroys of Southern India, whose Nawabs or deputies all the others in that region were. There are some families in which the title Nawab is hereditary by courtesy, and is given to every male, though they have no possessions, and are, in fact, private gentlemen. The following, however, is the address of one who is a sovereign prince (though so far down in the list that he is not called His Highness), taken from a semi-official letter: \"To the Nawab Saheb Sidi Ahmad Khan Sidi Ibrahim Khan, Nawab of Janjira.\" Here the strange title Sidi is that applied more or less throughout Islam to African Moslems. It has got down in the world so far as to be applied, under the form 'Seedy boys,' to the African stokers employed on the mail steamers. Sidi Ibrahim Khan is the name of the father of the addressee, who, upon a complimentary despatch, would have a string of Persian titles, wound up with Lord Strangford's favourite \"dam Altafhoo.\" His most remarkable epithet, however, is 'the Habsi,' or Abyssinian par excellence, and his territory is commonly called 'Habsan' or Ethiopia, being in fact a\nbit of India annexed to Africa by the unconquerable pluck of a handful of 'Habshi' Vikings, who established a tiny Jomsborg on the coast two centuries ago, and have held on to it with desperate tenacity ever since. I think that there is only one other Sidi, or African family of rank in India now, that of the Nawabs of Sachin, a branch of the house of Janjira.\n\nShah, besides meaning a king, is used as a termination of the names of Fakirs, perhaps as indicating that \"their mind to them a kingdom is.\"\n\nOne noble family in Western India adds this syllable to every name. This is the house of Aga Khan, the representative of the Old Man of the Mountain, now represented by the second generation born in India. The head of it is always called His Highness Aga Khan, and each other member Aga Husen Shah, Aga Ali Shah, and so forth. No other Indian house, that I know, uses the Turkish title Aga. Kazi, as an official title, precedes the name of the bearer. But like all Indian offices, that of Kazi has a tendency to become hereditary, and to be used as a title by all members of the privileged family, and in some such cases it becomes a sort of surname, and follows the personal name. I know one person who called himself Ajm u'd din Kazi; which was more than his neighbours would be bothered with getting round, so they called him Aju Kaju, and do still, no doubt, if he is alive.\n\nThe same remarks apply to Mumshi, wherever it does not mean simply 'a clerk.' Respectable Musulmans are often addressed as Miya, which may be translated 'Sir'; and old ones as Bare Miya, which may be called a courteous way of saying 'Old Gentleman!' I knew this latter phrase to be applied regularly to an old Musalman prince by his own family (who went in fear for their lives of him), but I have not seen either term used in writing.\n\nThe border tribes of Pathans, Baluch, and so forth, have a style of their own. The tribal name is here very important. A man is Ahmad Khan Saduzai, Ismail Khan Magzi, or so forth, the second word being the tribal name,\nand the father's name rarely quoted. Many of the tribes are subdivided, and in that case the second name is that of the subdivision, that of the great *gens* underlying it, as in the Maratha or Rajput practice. Only, as the Afghans and Baluch are Musulmans, and endogamous, it is easy amongst them for a subdivision to get separated from the main tribe, and set up on its own account. They have, indeed, genealogies, but very poor and untrustworthy, compared to those of Hindus, or even of Arabs, *carent quia rate sacro*, because they have no bards or family priests of much importance, and are, on the whole, an illiterate set of noble savages. Titles of any kind are scarce and simple among them, and are nearly always prefixed to the personal name. Almost the only one peculiar to them (as opposed to India proper) is *Malik*, meaning only a chief, as *Malik Ahmad Khan Alizai*.\n\nThe particles *zai* and *khail*, in composition, mean tribe or clan, but are not very definitely used, nor universal in application; that is, the *Ahmadkhail* and *Usmanzai* may both be subdivisions of a third *khail* or *zai*, or either may be a subdivision of the other, without any reference to the termination; or you may have a tribal name that does not include either, as *Otak* or *Waziri*. Baluch tribal names end in anything you like, but most commonly in the vowel *i*. Any community big enough to resist external hammering, and cohesive enough to enforce some shadow of internal administration, will be found to have at least a pretence of common origin, and to call itself an *Ulus*, though this word is Mongol, or North-Eastern Turkish.\n\nFinally, of Musulman names, it may be observed that all their appendices are written as separate words, having a distinct meaning, and where these occur, it is almost necessarily absurd to prefix 'Mr.' or add 'Esquire.'\n\nParsis write first their own name and then their father's without any connecting word, and add a surname, as already noticed; and the same is the practice of the Indian Beni-Israel, whom we, in spite of their teeth, call Jews. These 'Beni-Israel' of the Bombay side claim to be descended\nfrom the survivors of a shipwreck near Bombay, which happened at some remote period. For details of them see Bombay Gazetteer, Kolaba and Janjira volume, which is in our library. They have nothing whatever to do with the Cochin 'Jews' of any colour.\n\nHindu ascetics do not ordinarily use the common terminations, but have special ones of their own, as gir, bharti, etc.; but without reference to the termination, the full name of one of these will show his profession, as his own name is followed by his present or original instructor's, linked to it by the word guru 'teacher,' thus, Haridwargir guru Khemgir Gosai. It is worth while here to observe that the term Fakir is purely Musalman, and its application to any Hindu a solecism of the first magnitude. The word Gosai in the quotation indicates that the bearer is a Saiva ascetic, and the peculiar termination gir the order to which he belongs. There are others, but I have not space here to give more than an example. Like ascetics elsewhere, they take 'names of religion,' and drop those received from their parents after the flesh. They have therefore no tribal nor surnames.\n\nNatives of India do not as a rule use initials of proper names when writing their own languages. It is not that they might not do it if they liked, for the Maratha and Gujarati printed and cursive alphabets possess initial syllables, which are called Sanksheps, and are, I believe, derived from Sanskrit practice; but these are only used for complimentary titles and phrases, which happen to be a matter of course. The address of a letter, for instance, from one of my clerks to another would run like this: Ra. Ra. Narayanrao Krishnarao Phadke. Here the first Ra. stands for Rajmanya, and the second for Rajashri, the rest being the personal name, father's name, and surname of the addressee.\n\nWhen a Maratha has to write in his own language the name of an European with initials, he adopts the extraordinary futility of spelling the names of the initial letters, thus: Me. dabalu yeph Sin Kler, Sahib bahadur, goes to\nrepresent W. F. Sinclair, Esq. Here the Mr. is a Sankshep representing an adapted Persian adjective Meherban, which, preceding the actual name, and taken with the Sahib bahadur after it, indicates that the addressee is a gentleman by position or office. Amongst Marathas luckily the ceremonial address stops with these three words. In some other Indian languages the complimentary phrases at the start of a letter amount to a serious nuisance.\n\nIf the European addressed has any tail to his name, indicated by initial letters, these are also spelt out phonetically by name, as K\u00e9 si bi, or Yel yel di. I have often endeavoured to persuade my own clerks to adopt the rational use of Sanksheps for initials; but it was throwing words away, for still those mild Hindus would have their will, neither would they ever write the full names, which would have been just as easy as their own abominable practice. A local government, and nothing less, could reform this.\n\nIn connection with this subject one can hardly help noticing the various forms of vulgarism or solecism which go in India by the general name of Chee-chee. It is not easy to define this, but when you get an Anglo-Indian word that is not in any Asiatic language, though supposed to be Indian by the European using it, nor in any European language, though supposed to be English by the native using it, you may call that word chee-chee. I hope that you will do so, with an accent to impress upon the speaker the necessity of not using that word again.\n\nA much more venial offence is that of merely giving a manageable English pronunciation to a native name. Many of these are now practically English words, as Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Nizam, and Purr-tab-Sing (read as a music-lesson to a cat), and Dew-leap-Sing will doubtless die out presently.\n\nA good piece of \"chee-chee\" in names is in one of this month's magazines, which quotes Sir Tanjore Madhavarao as making a speech in India. To equal this, an Indian paper must report a temperance joke by Sir Law Wilfrid, for the personal and surnames are transposed, and the latter shorn\nof a significant syllable. The proper style of the knight is Sir Madhavarao Tanjorkar, in which the Sir is the English title, Madhavarao his personal name with the civil tail due to a Brahmin of good family, and Tanjorkar is the surname of his family, earned by service under the now extinct Bhonsla dynasty of Tanjore. The use of the father's name is, of course, unnecessary in identifying a man who bears an unusual title; but if this statesman has a grandson of his own sort, it would be quite natural that he should both own the name Madhavarao and win the honour of knighthood (one cannot say 'the spurs,' as the proper shoeing of his raee is in slippers). It is an attenuating circumstance that Sir Madhavarao's name has often been turned upside down before, which is said to have been caused by a misapprehension of its entry in the Madras University lists, Tanjorkar, Madhavarao; but this only makes it a better example of \"ehee-chee.\"\n\nIn another magazine article some time ago the writer introduced an imaginary Babu Muhammad Das as worshipping Her Majesty's picture, or something very like it, every 1st of January, since her assumption of the title of Empress. Now Babu is a title used by many Hindus on the Bengal side, and a few in Western India; and it may be here and there applied to a Musalman, probably a good deal against the grain. But Das is a regular Hindu word, meaning 'servant,' and in a name implies the dedication of the child so named to a god; so, if Sir Madhavarao had been born of one of the trading castes of Gujarat, he might reasonably have been called Madhav Das; but it is as sure as anything of the sort can be that no Musalman ever called his son anything Das,\u00b9 and that no Hindu ever called his son Muhammad anything; and, moreover, that no one with Muhammad in his name ever was caught playing such fantastic pranks before the portrait of Her Majesty, or of any one else now on earth. I dare say some Hindus may do it, that would not be at all surprising. This, therefore, is\n\n\u00b9 The Musalman rendering of this idea would have been Abd u'l Rasul or Abd e'n Nabi.\nwhat Lord Strangford would have called \"chee-chee in excelsis.\" Another form of it is the translating of native names for greater glory, usually wrong. The unlucky hill-station of Mahabaleshwar has had its not very mystical name travestied as 'the great strength of God,' and 'the Lord of great strength,' on the ground that Maha='great,' Bal='strength,' and Eshcar='Lord.' As a matter of fact, Mahabali is here a proper name; and Mahabaleshcar simply asserts the dominion of Eshcar (in this case Siva) over the said Mahabali. The best bit of \"chee-chee\" in this line is the famous rendering of Parbutty (a temple-crowned hill near Poona) as 'the mountain of light.' This rests upon Pahar='a hill,' and batti, which is a word for a lamp reduced to its simplest expression, 'a wick floating in oil,' and therefore 'a light'; but Parbutty is only \"chee-chec\" for Parvati='the mountain maid,' which is a name of a goddess, the daughter of the god of the Himalaya, or, if you prefer it, of the mountain itself looked on as a god.\n\nOne can only realize the value of such blunders by supposing Max O'Rell to introduce Mr. Gladstone to the French public as Monsieur de la Roche Joyeuse, and to describe the Mendip Hills as Les montagnes de l'illumination des hommes (from 'men'=hommes and 'dip'=illumination).\n\nAs a matter of prudence it is usually well to avoid diving into the meaning of Hindu names. Those of places have constantly been much corrupted, and convey little idea, or a wrong one, to most people not being regular scholars. The words in the more striking names are often in a dialect not understood of the people; and the explanations of local priests and Pandits are more apt to be wrong than right. What those of unlearned Europeans are like may be guessed from the samples given above. Pratapgarh, the name of a fortress near Mahabaleshwar (in chee-chee Purr-tab-gurr) means very nearly Chateau Gaillard, but to the natives around this means about as much as Joyous Gard would mean to the first gunner of the first garrison battery. And although a Rajput may well be called Jay sing, it will seldom occur to him that that means the Lion of Victory, or\nsomething like it; and if he meets a lion, he probably will not call it *sing* at all, but *untia bagh*, or *camelish tiger*, to indicate that its shape reminds him of a tiger's, and its colour of a camel's. We are apt to credit the Oriental with a good deal more imagination and romance than he has, because he and his surroundings are striking to our minds, early trained to such impressions.\n\nThe truth is that, at least in Western India, he is in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred chiefly occupied with the question of earning a living, and in the hundredth case his romance is probably artificial and but skin-deep; the big words of his language are only the echoes of feelings never common, and now long gone out of fashion, and owe much of their force to our own enthusiasm, itself not very long ago come into fashion. It is not under such circumstances that scientific etymology has much chance of progress. It comes to pass in another way altogether, and that is why these noble sentiments commonly turn out to be chee-chee.\n\nFinally, to return to personal names, whose confusion in our lists has suggested the remarks above recorded, it appears to me that where there are surnames, they should be treated in lists as our own are. Where there are none, the principal name, that is, the one in common use, should begin the entry. Initials should not be used at all, except for European titles and degrees; they are only useful where they represent common words easily guessed at.\n\nLong strings of Oriental titles should be avoided as far as possible. The few persons whose dignity really requires them all possess private secretaries.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\n1. The Val\u0101ha J\u0101t\u0101ka.\n\nSir,\u2014With reference to my translation of the Tibetan version of this legend, I wish to add that the story is also found, as Dr. Serge D'Oldenburg kindly reminds me, in the K\u0101randa-vy\u016bha (ed. Calc. pp. 52-59), being essentially the same version as ours, though not all the particulars occur, and certainly older than either Tibetan or Chinese. The horse-king here is called val\u0101ha. With the Chinese version agrees the 'iron city' (\u0101yasa-nagaram), perhaps the name of the tree (campaka), see above, p. 474 notes 2 and 3, and the herb with name sarva\u00e7veta ('all light'), which the horse-king eats, see above, p. 475 note 3. When the captain starts for his search in the night (see above, p. 474), he takes his sword 'shining as the moon' (candr\u0101rabh\u0101sa).\n\nH.

Very full and carefully planned arrangements have already been made by the local organizers of the Congress, both as to the hours and places at which papers will be read, and as to the varied series of hospitalities which have been offered by his Majesty (King Oscar II., the\nespecial patron of the Congress), and others, to the members of the Congress. The programme gives full details as to the journey, the hotels to be recommended, and other details of importance to intending members.\n\nEpigraphia Indica.\u2014We have received the first part of this new Journal devoted to Indian inscriptions, antiquities, and archaeology. It is to appear quarterly and is under the editorship of Dr. Burgess, assisted by Dr. F\u00fchrer, Dr. Hultzsch, Mr. Rea, and Mr. Cousens, all connected, in one way or another, with the Archaeological Survey, of which the new Journal announces itself, in its secondary title, as the official record. Being in folio size, it is particularly suitable for the reproduction of inscriptions, and it will be no doubt convenient for the officers of the Archaeological Survey to have a Journal of their own appearing at regular intervals. These reasons have doubtless led to the establishment of yet another Journal, though there are three others in existence in which the eight inscriptions here published might have appropriately appeared. Dr. Burgess says very rightly in his few words of preface that \"The great importance of Indian inscriptions as a means of illustrating and completing our knowledge of the history of the country, fixing the eras of its dynasties, the character of its peculiar land tenures, the derivation and development of its various alphabets, and other subjects of like importance, has long since been recognized by . . . all Orientalists.\" When we add that half the present issue is the work of Professor B\u00fchler, and the other half that of Professor Kielhorn, it will be seen that the deciphering of inscriptions for the new Journal has been entrusted to the very best possible hands. The subscription is eight rupees per annum, if paid in advance, and the price to buyers is three rupees a quarter.\n\nThe Tod MSS.\u2014Professor B\u00fchler and Dr. Zachariae have published in Berlin an account of the Navas\u0101has\u0101nka-Carita, a unique MS., hitherto overlooked, in this collection of Sanskrit MSS. belonging to the Royal Asiatic Society. The author's name is Padma-gupta, or Parimala, and he lived in the last quarter of the 10th and in the beginning of\nthe 11th century A.D. The work contains a poetical account, doubtless based on historical realities, of the adventures of Sindhura-aja or Navasahasanka, King of Malwa, during the earlier part of the author's life. The brochure contains a complete view of all that the poem affords of possible historical value. It gives additional proof of the importance of having this rare collection brought more fully to the notice of scholars\u2014a want which we hope to meet, at least partially, by the publication in an early issue of the Journal of a handy and complete catalogue.\n\nHistory of the Sikhs.\u2014Under the above title Lieut.-Col. Henry Court has published at Lahore a translation of the Sikk\u0101n de R\u0101j d\u012b Vikhi\u0101, together with a short Gurmukhi grammar and a glossary of technical terms. The work translated being prescribed for examinations in Panjabi, this book will be found very useful. The author refers in his preface to the fact that his translations of verses quoted from the \u0100di Granth often differ from those of Dr. Trumpp. It is the greater pity that he omitted in some cases to quote the pages of the learned German's work, where the former versions can be found.\n\nShakespear's Merchant of Venice has been translated into Hind\u012b prose by a lady of Jubbulpur, by name \u0100ry\u0101, a pupil of S\u016brya Prasad Misra of the Benares College. Sir Edwin Arnold has added a preface in which he pays a graceful tribute of praise to this very interesting result of female education in India. The work is published at the 'Amar' press in Benares.\n\nK\u0101lid\u0101sa's \u015aakuntala has been translated into French from a Tamil version by M. Gerard Dev\u00e8ze (Paris, Maisonneuve). As the version differs from the known recensions of the Sanskrit text, it is to be regretted that the translator gives no particulars at all of the Tamil author. But in the dearth of our knowledge of Tamil literature, we can nevertheless welcome this useful work of a promising student.\nART. III.\u2014Notes on the Early History of Northern India.\n\nPart II. By J. F. Hewitt, late Commissioner of Chota Nagpur.\n\nIn a paper printed in the Journal of this Society in July, 1888, I adduced reasons for believing that there existed adequate evidence to prove the truth of the following statements with regard to the early history of Northern India,\n\n(1) That Northern India was peopled by Kolarian and Dravidian tribes long before the Aryans came into the country.\n\n(2) Of the two races who preceded the Aryans, the Kolarians were the first immigrants.\n\n(3) The Dravidians, when they assumed the government of countries originally peopled by Kolarian tribes, retained the village communities established by their predecessors, but reformed the village system. They made each separate village, and each province formed by a union of villages, more dependent on the central authority than they were under the Kolarian form of government.\n\n(4) Under the Dravidian rule, all public offices, beginning with the headships of villages, were filled by nominees appointed by the State instead of being elective as among the Kolarians.\n\n(5) The Dravidians set apart lands appropriated to the public service in every village, required the tenants to cultivate these public lands, and store their produce in the royal and provincial granaries; this being the form in which the earliest taxes were paid.\n\n(6) They also in the Dravidian villages made\nevery man and woman bear his or her share in contributing to the efficiency of the government, but this process was not followed out in the same completeness in Kolarian villages, where the people were not so ready as the Dravidian races to submit to the same strict discipline, to which the Dravidians had been accustomed long before they entered India. (7) The Dravidian religion was evolved out of totemism, but was a much higher form of belief than the totemistic fetishism which preceded it. (8) The object of their worship was the earth, as the father and mother of all things, and therefore the parent of the totems, which had previously been considered to be their tribal ancestors. (9) They worshipped the earth under the symbol of the snake or phallus representing the central generative power of nature. (10) This still continues to be the popular form of religion throughout a large part of the country under the guise of \u015aiva-worship. (11) The chief opponents of Aryan progress were the Dravidian races, who had covered the country with a network of strongly-centralized and well-established governments. (12) The leading position the Aryans ultimately obtained was gained not so much by direct conquest as by alliances with native tribes, intermarriages with powerful chiefs and their most distinguished subjects, and by the great moral and political influence secured by the excellent organization, self-denying earnestness, perseverance, and tact of the Aryan Brahmins.\n\nIn the present paper I do not intend to deal directly, but only inferentially, with the greater number of these propositions, which I have tried to prove in detail both in the paper I have named above, and in two other papers of mine which I have there referred to.\u00b9 What I hope now to show is (1) That a careful examination of the Rigveda and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata gives additional reasons to those already adduced for believing the above statements to be in the main correct. (2) That a fairly accurate outline of the history of Northern India in\n\n\u00b9 Chota N\u0101gpur, its People and Resources, Asiatic Quarterly Review, April, 1887; and Village Communities in India, Journal of the Society of Arts, May 6, 1887.\nVedic times, and for some centuries after the close of that period, can be deduced from evidence furnished chiefly by these authorities. (3) That the statements taken from the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and Rigveda can be supplemented, and their historical significance more clearly shown, by corroborative evidence taken from other Indian authorities, and from the Greek and Latin authors who have given accounts of India which are for the most part taken from information recorded by Megasthenes, ambassador at the court of Chandragupta of P\u0101\u1e6d\u0101liputra (Patna) between 315 and 291 B.C. Besides Megasthenes, the principal authorities used by these writers were works written by persons who had accompanied the expedition of Alexander the Great.\n\nI shall, in working out this attempted sketch of the history of the country, try to trace out the early Indian history of the more important tribes mentioned in the Rigveda. I will try to show what part they each took in the leading historical events of the Vedic period, and that of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. Two of these tribes are only mentioned in the Rigveda, and are there distinctly said to be Aryan tribes. These are the Ar\u1e47a and the Trtsus. Besides these there are the five tribes of the Puru, Anu, Druhyu, Yadu, and Turvasu, said to be descended from the sons of Yay\u0101ti, who were called by these names. The Vaikarna, Nahusha, Bh\u0101rata, Matsya, Gandh\u0101ri, Chitraratha, \u015ar\u1e45jaya, \u015aiva, and Tugra, Chedi, Suvar\u1e47a, and \u015aambara. As to these last, the \u015aambara, all that I can say about them is, that they appear to be the early inhabitants of Kashmir. They are only mentioned in connexion with the conquests of the Trtsu king Divodasa.\n\nAr\u1e47a and Chitraratha.\u2014These tribes are, I believe, only once mentioned in the Rigveda.\u00b9 They are there said to be Aryans, and the passage gives an account of their defeat by the Yadu Turvasu. The name Ar\u1e47a seems to be connected with the Ara\u1e47i or fire-stick, the sacred stick which produced fire by friction, and which is so well known in the history of fire-worship as the Swastika. The name therefore probably\n\n\u00b9 Rigv. iv. 30, 18.\nmeans the fire-worshippers, and it is apparently the name of the most distinctly Aryan of the two tribes named. The Chitraratha are almost certainly the charioteers or the people of the gaudy chariot (chitra 'variegated,' ratha chariot'). I shall give their history in full when I come to speak of the Gandharvi, whose king in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is called Chitraratha, and I shall then discuss the further question as to whether the Chitraratha are a pure Aryan tribe or not.\n\nTrtsus.\u2014These are, I believe, the same people as the Ar\u1e47a, the latter being a different name for the Trtsu tribe. The Trtsus are throughout the whole of the Rigveda the most prominent of the people spoken of as Aryans. The greater part of the historical hymns in all the Mandalas except the eighth are full of accounts of deeds done by their great leaders Divodasa and his son Sudas. They seem to have come into India from the north, most probably like other invaders from the same quarter, by the Kabul Valley, and to have fought their way down to the upper waters of the five rivers of the Punjab where they leave the hills. They made no permanent settlement in the country watered by these rivers, but went southward till they reached the Sarasvat\u012b. They settled themselves on both banks of the Sarasvat\u012b at a very early period, and made the comparatively small area they there acquired their central stronghold, where they formed their plans for the moral and material conquest of India. In one hymn Vadhri\u1e63va, the father of Divoda\u1e63a, whose name seems to show a connexion with the charioteers or the people of A\u1e63va, the horse, is said to have received his celebrated son from the Sarasvat\u012b.\u00b9 But before they succeeded in making themselves complete masters of the banks of this river, and attained an influential position in the councils of the country through which they passed to reach this territory, they must have gone through a period of severe fighting. This is shown by the constant allusions to the conflicts with the \u015aambara, who lived among the\n\n\u00b9 Rigv. vi. 61, 1.\nmountains, and to their hundred citadels which Divodasa took.\\(^1\\) Divodasa seems also to have been successful in his campaigns against the Yadu Turvasu in spite of the defeat of the Aryau Arma, and the Chitraratha alluded to above. We find in one hymn Indra praised for the aid which enabled Divodasa to conquer the Yadu-Turvasu,\\(^2\\) and the victory of the Trtsu (here called Atithigva) over the same tribes is also mentioned in a hymn of Vasishtha.\\(^3\\) The chief allies of the Trtsus in the early stages of their progress through the country seem to have been the people called the Purus. But these Purus are named among the tribes who fought against Sudas and the Trtsus in the great battle of the ten kings.\\(^4\\) The Trtsus seem in that battle to have temporarily annihilated the confederacy opposed to them; but after the time of Sudas they are no more mentioned in the Rigveda, nor does their name appear in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. They seem to have remained in their ancient settlements between the Sarasvat\u012b and Drishadvat\u012b. This country was called, for reasons to be explained later on, the Kurukshetra, and afterwards became the holy land of Brahmanavarta created by the gods,\\(^5\\) the one spot where the people were pure Aryans. They seem to have become a colony of religious enthusiasts, and their leaders at all events held aloof from further projects of conquests by war. The object of their ambition seems to have been to work out the ideal form of religion of the strictest Brahminical schools who looked up to Vasishtha, the great bard of Sudas and the victorious Trtsus, as their original teacher. Under their system all power spiritual and temporal centred in the Brahmins, and it was from this holy land of Brahmanavarta that the teachings of this school were disseminated through the country in the form of the law-books. There were many other Brahminical schools which took their rise elsewhere,\n\n\\(^1\\) Rigv. ii. 19, 6; i. 26, 3; iv. 30, 20; vi. 26, 5, and many other places.\n\n\\(^2\\) Rigv. ix. 61, 1.\n\n\\(^3\\) Rigv. vii. 19, 8. The term Atithigva is used directly to mean the Trtsu, Rigv. i. 130, 7, and occurs in many other places in connexion with the victories over the \u015a\u0101mbara.\n\n\\(^4\\) Rigv. vii. 18, 13.\n\n\\(^5\\) Manu, ii. 17.\nsuch as those of the Kanva who are said to have written\nthe eighth Mandala of the Rigveda, and who were especially\nattached to the Yadu Turvasu.\\(^1\\) Those of the Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja who\nwrote the sixth Mandala of the Rigveda, and the Gautama, who\nwrote the fourth, were specially connected with the Bh\u0101ratas,\nand besides these there were many others. But all of these\nschools seem to have been much more liberal and open-minded\nthan those which claimed to be derived from that of the\npuritanical Vasishtha and his successors, and it was by these\nmore liberal schools, as I shall show further on, that the\ndoctrine of sun-worship was taught throughout the country\nby the missionary Brahmins, and it was they who altered\nthe native snake and nature-worship into that of \u015aiva.\nSouth of the Brahm\u0101varta, and distinct from it as stated by\nManu,\\(^2\\) was the country of the Surasena, whose capital was\nthe celebrated city of Mathura. The Surasena and their city\nare mentioned by Arrian,\\(^3\\) and Mathura is said in the Mah\u0101-\nbh\u0101rata to be the capital of the Y\u0101davas or Vrishnis.\\(^4\\) The\nY\u0101davas, and more especially their priests, belonging to the\nKanva family, with the Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja and Gautama, seem to\nhave been the leaders in the contest which gained political\nand military supremacy for the tribes which accepted Aryan\nguidance. The reputation of the Y\u0101davas as soldiers is\nshown in Manu\u2019s advice to kings to take their warriors from\nthe Surasena country, as well as from those of their most\nintimate allies and nearest neighbours the Matsya, Panch\u0101las,\nand people of Kurukshetra.\\(^5\\)\n\nPurus.\u2014This people seem to have been the earliest allies\nof the Trtsus. An elaborate account\\(^6\\) of the birth of Puru,\nthe eponymous ancestor of the tribe and of that of his four\nbrothers, Yadu, Turvasu, Druhyu, and Anu, is given in\nthe Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. They all are said to have become the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Rigv. viii. 4, 1 and 7; viii. 7, 18.\n\\(^2\\) Manu, 11, 19.\n\\(^3\\) Arrian, Indika, chap. viii.\n\\(^4\\) Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Sabha (Rajasuyarambha) Parva, xiv. p. 47. This and all\nother citations from the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata in this paper are made from Pert\u0101p Chundur\nRoy\u2019s translation, published in England by Williams & Norgate.\n\\(^5\\) Manu, vii. 193.\n\\(^6\\) \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, sect. lxxii. to lxxxv.\nfathers of tribes called after them. They were said to be the sons of Yay\u0101ti, by his two wives Devayana, daughter of the Rishi Sukra, and Sharmishth\u0101, daughter of the Asura king Vrishaparva. Yay\u0101ti was the son of Nahusha, called elsewhere the great serpent. According to the story in which Nahusha is thus described, he is said to have contended with Indra for supremacy in heaven, to have been vanquished in the contest and changed into a serpent.\n\nThe discussion of the many questions connected not only with these five tribes, but also with the others who will be treated of in this paper, will be greatly simplified by considering the point of view from which Indian history is regarded in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, as it is from this source that almost all the information given as to ancient India by Sanskrit authors is derived. I shall then proceed to give a sketch of the trade carried on in early times from the western ports of India, as it will be shown in the sequel of the paper that a thorough appreciation of the great and very early importance of this trade is necessary for the understanding of the history of the country. For India in former times, no less than at present, owed a great part of its prosperity to foreign commerce, and political and ethnological changes in the population were caused chiefly by contests for trade supremacy.\n\nThe Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata may be described as a great epic narrative poem containing a continuous story, which sets forth in the dramatic form called epical a fairly consecutive series of events in the early history of Northern India. The history thus recorded is, as I hope to prove, based on real occurrences; but the actual facts have in the process of reduction to the form in which they appear in the poem been greatly distorted, partly to meet the proposed requirements of a poetical narrative, but also because the story is written entirely from an Aryan point of view. It was evidently composed after the Aryan supremacy had been universally acknowledged throughout the central and most populous, fertile, and prosperous parts of the country, and long after Aryan dialects had become the\n\n1 Udyoga (Samyodyoga) Parva, sect. viii. to xvii.\npopular language of all classes of the people except the rude dwellers in the forests and mountains.\\(^1\\) One great difficulty in identifying tribes named in the Rigveda and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is caused by the writers being either Aryans or persons who claimed to be Aryans. These writers always looked upon other tribes as outsiders, and did not therefore speak of them as they would be spoken of by those belonging to the tribe. In naming them they more often than not called them by names given to them by Aryans, and not by those used by the people themselves; sometimes when the correct name is given, it is that of a clan which does not tell that of the tribe to which the clan belongs. Sometimes numerous tribes are included in one common name, which has been given to them by the Aryans. The difficulties of identifying tribes spoken of in this way are very great, especially when the Aryan writers distort tribal names so as to give them an Aryan meaning. This, as I shall show in the sequel, has been frequently done.\n\nThe story of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is interspersed with innumerable digressions and later additions which make up by far the greater part of the eighteen lengthy cantos into which it is divided. Some of the sedigressions are mythical and legendary tales, some half-historical, while others embody long ethical, metaphysical, and ritualistic discussions. Many of these are of great value for historical purposes, and among those which may be mentioned as especially bearing on the present inquiry are the long accounts of the holy places pilgrims are advised to visit, and of the journey made by the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas to the different shrines.\\(^2\\)\n\nMost scholars, I believe, now agree that the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata was put together nearly in its present form about 400 B.C., but some parts must be very much older. Many of the digressions, especially the legends and genealogies, appear in a number of different forms evidently composed at various\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) We find Vidura speaking to Yudishthira in the Mleccha language, \u0100di (Jatul-Griha) Parva, clxvii. p. 433, and in Vedic times all people except Aryans or those taught by Aryans spoke their own languages. Non-Aryans are called Mrdhrav\u0101c, a term which implies speaking a foreign language.\n\n\\(^2\\) Vana (Tirtha-Yatra) Parva, sects. lxxx-clvi.\ntimes and from various sources, but the actual groundwork of the poem must be very much earlier than the later forms of the legends contained in it. To judge from the tone of its contents it would seem to have been written during the time the Brahmanas were composed, when Brahminism was purely ritualistic, sacrificial, and ascetic, and the idea of the supremacy of the Brahmins was in its infancy. The snake-gods of the Dravidians were still objects of universal reverence, and the descent of the leading tribes from snake ancestors is openly asserted. The strongest proof of the great hold that snake-worship had on the minds of the people is shown in the statement that the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and Krishna have descended from a snake king. A new snake-god \u0100riaka was invented as the father of the Aryans, and this \u0100riaka is said to be the great-grandfather of Pr\u012btha or Kunti, the mother of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, and of the father of Krishna, the sun-god of the black (Krishna) races.\n\nWe find the worship of the snake-gods, especially in the West, becoming subordinate to that of Indra and the sun, the snake-gods being held to be inferior deities; while in the East it was being diverted from the several tribal snake-gods, and concentrated on the Dravidian and Kolarian god \u015aiva, who was the father, first of all snake-born races, and afterwards of all living beings. The Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, though probably not much if at all older than the oldest Upanishads, is much earlier than those like the Brihad\u0101ranyika and Ch\u0101ndogya Upanishads, in which Janaka, king of Videha, and Yajnavalkya play a prominent part, and where the centre of philosophic thought is placed in the East in the land of the Videhas and Panch\u0101las, and not in the West, as in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. The Ram\u0101yana shows how intimately the Videhas of Mithila, the tribe to which S\u012bt\u0101, Rama\u2019s wife, belonged, and the Ikshv\u0101kus of S\u0101keta and Ayodhya were connected together. But when the older parts of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata were written, the Ikshv\u0101kus had not left Western India, and the Videha kingdom was not founded.\n\n1 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, cxxviii. p. 377.\n2 Janaka, king of Videha, is said to have been conquered by Bh\u012bma, but this\nof Suvala, the king of the Ikshv\u0101kus, living near the Indus as a vassal of Jayadratha, king of the Sindhu-Sauv\u012bras, and acting as one of his principal generals.\\(^1\\) As he plays a somewhat prominent part in the battle in which Draupadi was rescued from the Sauv\u012bra, the writer of the story must have thought of the Ikshv\u0101ku as a clan living near the Indus, and not in the far east in Ayodhya.\n\nThe general tone of philosophical and ethical thought is less Brahministic than in the Upanishads, as it is the kings and heroes like Krish\u1e47a and Yudishthira, and not the Brahmins, who lay down ethical rules and answer the doubts of their interrogators.\\(^2\\) Though the divine lay of the Bhagavadg\u012bt\u0101 is evidently much later than the first rise of the doctrines and speculations contained in it, yet it is distinctly earlier than the writings of the later Brahmin philosophers, and of the Buddhistic and Jainist schools, as it contains the undeveloped germs of all three systems. Vishnuism in its later forms, and also sun-worship in its successive stages, are continually recurring in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata; but the Vishnuistic passages must be very much later than the main body of the poem, which treats Krish\u1e47a, who became later on the embodiment of Vishnu, as a living hero, almost but not quite a god. The asceticism which prompted pilgrimages and austerities is also apparently a later feature of the work, arising out of the development of the idea of sacrifice.\n\nThe idea of caste or caste rules is entirely unknown to the actors in the poem, and the continual intermixture of castes which takes place throughout the story creates little or no remark. Yudishthira in his discourse with the snake Nahusha\\(^3\\) says: \u201cIn human society it is difficult to ascertain one\u2019s caste because of the promiscuous intercourse among the four orders. Men belonging to all the orders have children by women of all the orders.\u201d This is evidently a later interpolation, as Vidcha is mentioned as being conquered directly after the southern Mallas of Mallar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, or M\u0101lava, and before the S\u0101kas who lived close to the M\u0101lava country (Sabha Digvijaya Parva, p. 86).\n\n\\(^1\\) Vana (Draupadi-harana) Parva, cclxiv. p. 782.\n\n\\(^2\\) See the conversation of Yudishthira with the Yaksha (Vana (Aranya) Parva, ccxxii. and many other places).\n\n\\(^3\\) Vana (Ajagara) Parva, cxxx. p. 531.\nalmost certainly a later passage, and in the earlier parts of the poem caste had evidently not been thought of. The exact date at which the original poem was written is very difficult to fix; but as it was composed before the Ikshv\u0101kus thought of emigrating to Ayodhya, and the Videha kingdom was founded, it must be several hundred years earlier than the Ch\u0101ndogya and Brihad\u0101ranyika Upanishads, which are, I believe, thought to have been written about 500 B.C. This would give about 800 or 900 B.C. as the original date of the poem, though I believe it may even be earlier than that.\n\nThe poem is said to have been composed by the Brahmin Rishi Vy\u0101sa, otherwise called Krishna-dwaipayana.\u00b9 Vy\u0101sa is said to have been the son of Satyavat\u012b, a Matsya princess,\u00b2 who afterwards became the wife of \u015aantanu the Kauravya king. His father was the Rishi Para\u015bara mentioned in the Rigveda as one of the Tr\u012btsu\u2019s bards.\u00b3 The Matsya or fishermen were, as will be shown in the sequel, a branch of the great tribe of the Bh\u0101ratas, who were near neighbours of and generally in alliance with the Y\u0101davas, though they fought against the Tr\u012btsus and Y\u0101davas in the great battle of the ten kings.\u2074 Satyavat\u012b\u2019s sons by \u015aantanu died without male heirs, and the Rishi Vy\u0101sa, at his mother\u2019s request, raised up seed to the Kauravya line from the widows of Vichitra Virya, her younger son.\u2075 Vichitra Virya had succeeded his elder brother Chitrangada\u2076 on the death of the latter without heirs. Dhritar\u0101shtra, father of the Kauravya leader, was born of this union, and also P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du (the fair prince), reputed father of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, the opponents of the Kauravyas.\u2077 The real fathers of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas,\n\n\u00b9 \u0100di Parva, i. p. 4.\n\u00b2 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, cv. p. 318.\n\u00b3 Rigv. vii. 18. 21.\n\u2074 Rigv. vii. 18. 6.\n\u2075 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, cv. and cvi. pp. 319 to 323.\n\u2076 Chitrangada was the snake god, the dominant of the moon. See Appendix B. His death without heirs, and his being succeeded by a dynasty of which the Rishi Vy\u0101sa was the real father, signifies the substitution of Aryan sun-worship for that of the Lunar and snake-worshipping races. This was carried out, as will be shown in the sequel, under the guidance of the Aryan Brahmans, the Matsya or Bh\u0101rata, and the Gandh\u0101ri tribes, who led the Panch\u0101la confederacy.\n\u2077 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, cxxiii. and cxxiv. pp. 359 to 366.\naccording to the poem, were Dharma, the god of justice, father of Yudishthira; Vayu the wind, father of Bh\u012bma; Indra, the father of Arjuna; and the twin Asvins, the fathers of Sahadeva and Nakula. The mother of the first three was Pr\u012btha or Kunti, the daughter of Sura, a Surasena chief,\u00b9 and the great-granddaughter of \u0100riaka, the Aryan snake-god. She was brought up at the court of her aunt\u2019s son Purujit,\u00b2 king of the Kuntibhojas.\u00b3\n\nThe two youngest P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were the sons of Madri,\u2074 daughter of the king of the Madras, whose capital was the celebrated city of \u015a\u0101kala or Sangala, on the Apaga, now the Ayak, a little south of the Chen\u0101b river.\u2075\n\nThe Madras were a non-Aryan tribe, and according to Hemachandra a branch of the Takkas or Takshakas. At the time when the events of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata took place, it would appear that \u015a\u0101kala was the Takka capital, as we hear very little in the parts of the poem dealing directly with the history of the Kauravyas and P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas of the people or city of Takkasil\u0101, so celebrated in later times. It was \u015aalya, king of the Madras, who with the Gandh\u0101ri king were the ruling powers in the Northern Panjab.\n\nThe ostensible story of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is the rivalry between the Kauravya sons of Dhritar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra aided by \u015aalya, king of the Madras, and the king of the Gandh\u0101ri of the Kabul valley, on the one side, and the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, aided by the kings of Paneh\u0101la and the Matsya, on the other. The real history underlying this legend is that of the gradual advance of the Southern and Western tribes against those of the North and East. What both sides really fought for was the control of the rivers, the great natural highways of the country and of the routes leading to the sea.\n\nThis was not a contest between Aryans and non-Aryans, but between indigenous races more or less intermixed with foreign\n\n\u00b9 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, cxi. p. 366.\n\u00b2 Sabha (Rajasuyarambha) Parva, xiv. p. 45.\n\u00b3 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, cxxviii. p. 377.\n\u2074 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, cxxiv. p. 366.\n\u2075 Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, p. 180.\nand Aryan elements. The Aryans were for the most part on the winning side, but there were also many chiefs who had intermarried with Aryans in the other party. The ultimate result of the war was to place the Surasena and Bh\u0101rata and their intimate allies the Panch\u0101las in command of the country, and to consummate the attainment by the Aryan chiefs of what had been the great object of their ambition since they first aspired to the supreme rule. The leaders of the confederacy of semi-Aryan Bhoja tribes, of which the tribe called Surasena became the head, had seen that those who secured the control of the trade must be the chief rulers of Northern India; and it was to attain this purpose that they allied themselves with the tribes of the south-west. They first aided the Bh\u0101ratas in the conquest of the valleys watered by the Nerbudda and Tapti; helped the Suvar\u1e47a\u00b9 in their progress eastward; and last of all effectually prevented the northern tribes from gaining the control of the valleys of the Jumna and Ganges.\n\nEarly trade and commerce.\u2014There is ample evidence to show that it was not the Aryans who made India a great exporting country. The Kolarian and Dravidian settlers had founded and maintained a flourishing inland and foreign trade long before the advent of the Aryans, and this trade could only have been begun and kept up by a people who had made great advances in civilization. For the maintenance of a large foreign and inland trade, there must be cities like those so frequently mentioned in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, in which merchants could live and store the minerals, forest and agricultural products, and the manufactured articles in which they dealt. These cities could not be built without carpenters and masons. The weavers of the coarser cottons and the fine muslins, which formed so large a part of the exports, must have congregated into the towns, to be near the merchants to whom they sold their goods. There must\n\n\u00b9 The Suvarna, i.e. the class (var\u1e47a) of the Sus or Saus, i.e. the traders. The name Sau is still preserved in Saud\u0101gur, a merchant, and Saukar, one who does a Sau's or merchant's business. Their first move eastward from P\u0101\u1e6d\u0101la was into the country called by their name Saurashtra, the kingdom of the Saus, the modern Guzer\u0101t.\nhave been workers in iron\\(^1\\) to make spears and weapons of war, axes to cut down forest trees, hoes and agricultural implements, and carpenters' and mining tools. Jewellers must have lived in the cities, to prepare for export the precious stones, of which such large quantities were sent to foreign countries. And there were also dyers among the manufacturing artisans, who, besides being conversant with other dyes, had learnt the difficult and recondite process of extracting dye from the indigo plant, indigo being in very early times, as it is now, a most valuable item among the Indian exports. Besides these classes, there were also necessarily in the cities potters, workers in leather, and petty shopkeepers and retail dealers. None of these occupations have ever been taken up by Aryans, but were in former times, as now, left in the hands of the Sudras or native races who originated them. The mines, which supplied so large a part of the wealth of India, and were the chief attractions to foreign merchants, give valuable evidence of the high stage of civilization to which these people had attained. These were not mere surface diggings in alluvial gravels, but were, as the old workings still extant show, made by following the lodes of metalliferous ore to considerable depths in the rocks which they permeated. The working of these mines required practical mechanical skill as well as the scientific aptitude and perseverance necessary to discover the proper method of treating the ores so as to extract the precious metals.\n\nThe large population of merchants, traders, artisans, miners, and collectors of forest produce, could not have been maintained unless agriculture had been in a flourishing condition. And that this was the case, is shown by the fact that pepper, saffron, oil, and clarified butter (ghce) furnished a very considerable part of the exports.\n\nThough the rivers supplied means of carriage throughout a large part of the country, the only rivers which reached\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 52, thinks that Ayas means brass, while Roth and Grassmann both believe it to be iron. Considering that iron ore is exceedingly common in all the rocky parts of India, and copper, tin, and zinc rare, it is probable that iron was smelted long before the compound metals were used.\nthe harbours of the Western coast were the Indus, Nerbudda, and Tapti. These, however, were of little use to the miners of Rajputana, and the trading and agricultural population on the banks of the Jumna and Ganges. Land carriage was necessary to bring produce to the western ports from the central plains, and this must have been provided at a very early period. The warriors in the Rigveda are all represented as fighting from chariots, and carts were invented long before war-chariots. The first two J\u0101taka stories, which are among the oldest in the collection, tell of the caravans of five hundred bullock waggons which merchants used to send to and fro between Benares and the sea-coast, and of the difficulties of passing through the desert.\u00b9 There are many other stories of the same kind, and these must have been popular for ages before they were included in Buddhist literature, and the state of society they describe must have existed long before these stories were invented.\n\nIt was only a strong and well-organized Government which could maintain the conditions necessary for protecting in their avocations the persons required to carry on commerce on the scale I have sketched out, and this Government was provided in the system of Dravidian rule. Though very strong, it was popular, and its power was based not on outside force, but on the co-operation of all the people, who were trained from their earliest infancy to obey the orders of their rulers, and to give active aid in the maintenance of law and order. The working of the constitution and the protection of the citizens was insured by an excellent police-service and a system of village and town committees, each of which consisted of five persons. These committees and the police-service are fully described by Strabo, quoting from Megasthenes.\u00b2 They are also spoken of in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, where it is said that \u201cthe five brave and wise men employed in the\n\n\u00b9 Appannaka J\u0101taka and Vannapatha J\u0101taka; Fausb\u00f6ll, vol. i. pp. 98 to 103, and 107 to 109; Buddhist Birth Stories translated by Rhys Davids, vol. i. pp. 138 to 145, and 174 to 179.\n\u00b2 Strabo, xv. i. 47-62. McCrindle\u2019s Ancient India, pp. 83-89.\nfive offices of protecting the city, the citadel, the merchants, agriculturists, and in punishing criminals, should always act in unison.\"\u00b9 This passage, like that in Strabo, means that there was a separate board for each department. The police are spoken of a few lines after those mentioning these committees of five persons. Traces of these boards and of the former police system still remain in the Panchayats or councils of five, and the Chokidars or village or ward policemen still found everywhere throughout India. These Panchayats have under Mahommedan, and, till recently, under English rule, when they have been used for administrative purposes, occupied a very subordinate position to that they used to hold, and were chiefly employed as arbitration committees in disputes. The Laws of Manu and those of the other Sanskrit law-writers take little account of the popular form of government. With them the king is supreme, except where Brahmins are concerned. There can, however, I think, be no doubt that the system of the law-writers is for the most part ideal, and that in reality the country was governed in the manner stated by the Greek writers and those in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, which quite agree with the indications of the old form of government we find still existing. As the system of government required each part of the state to be in constant touch with the central authorities, the kingdoms into which the country was divided were, especially where the country was populous, small. But these kingdoms were all linked together by a consciousness of mutual dependence, and by a knowledge of the necessity of common action for the promotion of trade. In the most prosperous periods, large numbers of these separate kingdoms were united for purposes of defence and offence under a common ruler, who controlled their foreign and military policy, leaving the internal government to the rulers of the several states. These united countries thus formed an imperial federation. In the Chota Nagpore villages and those of Chattisghur, in the Central Provinces, the old system still\n\n\u00b9 Sabha (Lokapala Sabhakhyana) Parva, v. p. 17.\nexists, and is for agricultural purposes and village organization but little altered. In a state constituted on these principles the people combined with the Government in keeping down predatory bands and fostering trade by every means in their power; the inducement being that, as long as they discharged the light duties required by the State, kept the king's granaries full, and provided for the support of the soldiers and police, they retained all the profits that they made. They therefore united with the authorities in securing the undisturbed collection of the gold, jewels, and other property exported, in taking care that agriculturists, artisans, and traders were allowed to work in peace and quiet, in insuring the safe conduct of goods to and from the ports, and in protecting the possessions of foreign and native merchants. The commerce thus fostered was free, hampered by no transit dues and restrictions, and all alike, both the Government and the people it ruled, shared in the profits. That the trade which was so carefully protected was regular and constant is proved by the accounts given of it in the books of Kings and Chronicles in the Bible. Solomon and his ally Hiram used to send every three years ships of Tarshish\\(^1\\) to India, called Ophir by the Jews, and Sophir by the Coptic Egyptians, the names being probably derived from that of the trading Suvarna.\\(^2\\) These ships used to bring back Indian produce, and the periodicity of the voyages shows that they could always rely upon finding a market well supplied with the goods they wanted. Their dealings in these expeditions must have been very large, as we read of at least four hundred and twenty talents of gold being brought to Solomon.\\(^3\\) The text seems to say that this amount was brought in one voyage, but it may also mean that gold to this value was brought in several voyages. Four hundred and twenty talents of gold must be worth somewhat over \u00a387,700\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) 1 Kings x. 22.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, pp. 497\u20139 and 561.\n\n\\(^3\\) 1 Kings ix. 28; 2 Chron. viii. 18, where the amount is 450 talents.\nin modern money.\\(^1\\) This must in the times I am now speaking of have been such an immense sum that one is tempted, if the amount be accepted as correct, to think it would not all have been brought in one voyage. The Phoenicians and Jews could not have sent enough goods in exchange to return so much gold in addition to the other goods they brought back. Whatever the exact interpretation may be, the whole account of the trade leaves little doubt that practically many millions of gold were brought from India to Palestine in Solomon's time. But the return cargoes in these triennial voyages were not made up of gold only, but also of silver, apes, ivory, peacocks, and algum or sandal wood. Silver is said to have been brought in such quantities that it was of no value in the days of Solomon,\\(^2\\) and the ivory must have been worth a great deal.\n\nBut in considering the extent of the Indian trade as a whole, it must be remembered that Palestine was one of the smallest countries that imported goods from India. Many centuries before Solomon a large maritime trade was carried on between the Accadian-Semitic empire of Assyria and India. The early builders of Ur or Mugheir, who about 4000 B.C. brought teak from India,\\(^3\\) also doubtless brought other goods. Though teak grew on the Kandesh hills, near Baragyza, or whatever other port on the Gulf of Kambay was resorted to by the importers, and was therefore easily obtained, yet the sending of it to foreign countries is strong evidence both of a large and varied trade, and of considerable civilization among the people of India. They could not, if mere savages, have learnt the value of teak timber and taught it to their customers.\n\nSir H. Rawlinson has shown that the early Chaldaean\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I have reckoned ten talents at about the value in round numbers of the Babylonian talent, which was doubtless the standard used by the Jewish reckoners. This, according to Herod. iii. 89, was to the Attic or Euboic talent, as 7 to 6. The Attic talent is considered to represent \u00a3243 15s. of our money, and I have taken the Babylonian talent at about \u00a3209. See Liddell and Scott, s.v. \u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd.\n\n\\(^2\\) 1 Kings x. 22.\n\n\\(^3\\) Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, pp. 18 and 137.\ninscriptions frequently speak of the \"Ships of Ur,\"\u00b9 and Prof. Rawlinson proves that gold, tin, silks, pearls, spices, and other articles of commerce had been brought by these ships from the beginning of the fourteenth century B.C., the date he gives for the foundation of the first Assyrian Empire.\u00b2 Prof. Sayce calls attention to the name Sindhu, evidently meaning from Sindhu or India, used in an old Babylonian list of clothes to mean muslin or woven cotton,\u00b3 and compares this name with the Greek \u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd, and the Hebrew Sadin, used for muslin in the Old Testament. The Hebrew word Tarshish, occurring in the list of stones on the breast-plate of the Hebrew High Priest, certainly means a stone brought by the ships of Tarshish, which traded with India. The Greek \u03b2\u03ae\u03c1\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 shows that the beryl came from India,\u2074 as it is evidently the same word as the Pali Ve\u1e6durya.\u2075 Kunkuma, the Sanskrit for saffron, is the same word as karkom in the Song of Solomon, and \u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9, used by Hippocrates, is the Sanskrit pippali.\u2076\n\nThe Tamil word for rice, arisi, is the same as the Greek word \u1f44\u03c0\u03c9\u03be\u03b1,\u2077 used simply by Theophrastus, who died 288 B.C., and also by Arrian, and in a compound form by Athen\u00e6us. Now dialects derived from the Sanskrit were spoken at all the Indian Western ports long before the time of the Buddha, and centuries before the Greek voyagers first went to India from Alexandria, which was founded during the lifetime of Theophrastus. The Tamil name used by him for rice must have come to\n\n\u00b9 India and the West in Old Days, by Prof. A.

There are three names of stones in this passage, Tarshish, Shoham, and Jashpheh, all of which are translated Beryl by different authors. The first is translated Beryl in the Authorised English version, the second in the Septuagint, and the third in the Vulgate. Gesenius s.v. translates Tarshish as Topaz. Kiel as a brilliant stone of a golden colour like what is now called chrysolite, which is pale green with a double refraction. It is probable that all these three stones came from India, as beryls, topazes, and chrysolite are all found there.\n\u2075 Chullavagga, v. 91, translated by Rhys Davids and Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xx. p. 82.\n\u2076 India and the West in Old Days, p. 4.\n\u2077 Liddell and Scott, s.v. \u1f44\u03c0\u03c9\u03be\u03b1.\nGreece at a very much earlier period, and was probably brought by the Phoenician sailors. Zimmer shows that rice was not known to the authors of the Rigveda, and the name used for rice in the Atharvaveda, where it is first mentioned by Sanskrit authors, is *vrihi*,\u00b9 which has nothing to do with the Tamil *arisi*. When the Tamil word *arisi* found its way westward, a Tamil-speaking, and not an Aryan population must have lived at the Western ports. There is still one more Indian export to be mentioned, which proves the existence of a very ancient trade between India and western countries; this is indigo. Sir Gardner Wilkinson gives among the list of things found in the tombs of the Eighteenth Dynasty woollen goods dyed with indigo, and Pliny does not give indigo among the list of crops grown in Egypt. We shall also see further on in the list of exports to Greece that it was certainly an Indian export.\u00b2 Now the Eighteenth Dynasty ruled in Egypt in the seventeenth century B.C.,\u00b3 and the Indian indigo and the Indian muslin, which was also found in these tombs, must have been brought by sea, showing that the trade was then no less active than it was at a later period.\n\nBefore giving further details as to the trade, it is desirable to fix the ports from whence it was carried on. The principal ports mentioned in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata are S\u016brp\u0101raka and Pr\u0101gjyotisha, both of these being on the Gulf of Kambay. S\u016brp\u0101raka, the modern Surat, was on the Payoshni (Tapti), and we are told in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata that it was built by a Vidarbha king.\u2074 The neighbouring port of Pr\u0101gjyotisha, probably the Baragyza of the Greeks, and the modern Bharoch on the Nerbudda, was the capital of Bhagadhatta king of the coast races,\u2075 about whom I shall say a great deal more later on in this paper.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 239.\n\u00b2 India and the West in Old Days, p. 3.\n\u00b3 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, new edition, art.

Pr\u0101gjyotisha or the Eastern Jyotisha was perhaps so called because it was on the east of the Gulf of Kambay, and lay to the east of the settlements of the Bhojas of Dv\u0101raka in K\u0101thi\u0101war, who gave the name. This name is clearly a Sanskrit name, and not one given\nThe third port, P\u0101\u1e6d\u0101la, near the mouth of the Indus, had apparently, when the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata was written, been somewhat eclipsed by the more southern ports, as many of the Suvar\u1e47a traders of P\u0101\u1e6d\u0101la had moved eastward and occupied the kingdom they called Saur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra; but it still doubtless did a large business and continued to do so till after the time of Alexander the Great's invasion. When the Periplus ascribed to Arrian was written, we find that the trading port of the Indus was no longer P\u0101\u1e6d\u0101la, but Minnagura, which Arrian says was the capital of the Parthian kings of Sindhu Sauvira. He calls the country Scythia, which evidently refers to the nationality of the kings, and of the chiefs among the people, who it will be shown probably came from Scythia. General Cunningham identifies it with Thatha, which lies a good deal to the south of P\u0101\u1e6d\u0101la. Arrian gives elaborate lists of the exports and imports both from Minnagura and Baragyza, which agree to a great extent with the list of goods I have already given, but contain more articles. From Minnagura were exported kostos, an aromatic root, gums, spikenard (Sanskrit narada), topazes, and sapphires, silk, fine linen, silk thread, and indigo (\u1f38\u03bd\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd). The imports are cloth, a few slaves (\u03bd\u03cc\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2), many-coloured (Egyptian) robes, gold-stone, coral, styrak gum, frankincense, glass vessels, silver, coined money, and some wine.\n\nFrom Ozene, the modern Ujjen, there were brought down to Baragyza onyxes procured from the jasper-yielding rocks of Gwalior and the Aravalli hills, and murrina (a costly material from which vases were made, probably the Agra soapstone), Indian muslin, yellow-coloured cloths, and some coarse cotton. There were also gums and spikenard from Proklais on the river Swat in Kabul.\n\nThe other exports from Ozene to Baragyza are the same as those from Minnagura, but from the Saur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra country by the people whom Bhagadhatta ruled, who were, as will be shown later on, principally of Kolarian origin.\n\n1 Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, p. 289.\n2 Arrian, Periplus, chap. 38, 39. \u1f38\u03bd\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd is translated Indigo in the notes to M\u00fcller's edition of the Periplus.\n3 Manual of Geology of India, Medlicott and Blanford, pp. 46 to 57.\n4 Arrian, Periplus, chap. 48.\nbetween Baragyza and Minnagura, where the people had large herds of cattle, rice, sesame, (tila) oil, ghee or clarified butter (\\(\\beta\\omega\\upsilon\\tau\\rho\\sigma\\)), cotton, both raw and woven, were sent.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe imports of Baragyza were Italian, Laodicean, and Arabian wine, brass, tin, cloths of various kinds, slaves, many-coloured girdles, styrak gum, clover-honey (\\(\\mu\\epsilon\\lambda\\iota\\lambda\\omega\\tau\\omega\\)), coarse glass, red sulphuret of arsenic (\\(\\sigma\\alpha\\eta\\delta\\alpha\\pi\\alpha\\kappa\\eta\\)), sulphuret of antimony (\\(\\sigma\\tau\\iota\\mu\\mu\\iota\\)), coined gold and silver for exchange with native money, and a little ointment. As special presents to kings costly silver vases, musical instruments, rich dresses, female slaves, excellent wine and unguents\\(^2\\) were brought by the traders.\n\nBesides the products here mentioned, Pliny speaks of the large quantity of gold and silver which was taken from the mines on the other (eastern) side of Mons Capitolia (Mount Ab\u016b),\\(^3\\) and he estimates the capital expended every year in the purchase of Indian goods at fifty million of sesterces, a sum equal to nearly \u00a3443,000, and says that 120 ships passed yearly out of the Red Sea to India.\\(^4\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Arrian, Periplus, chap. 41.\n\n\\(^2\\) Arrian, Periplus, chap. 49.\n\n\\(^3\\) Pliny, Hist. Nat., vi. 23. The country in which these silver mines were situated must have been that of Guzer\u0101t and the eastern slope of the Aravalli range. The silver now found there is always mixed with lead in the proportion of from ten to twenty or more ounces of silver to the ton of lead. The people who worked these mines for silver in ancient times must have been most intelligent and accomplished miners and mineralogists to be able to discover and apply the difficult process of separating the silver from the lead. This part of the country has only been cursorily examined by the Geological Survey, and the greater part of it is marked blank and unexplored in the Geological Survey Map. Among the mines mentioned in Medlicott and Blanford's Economic Geology of India the largest is that on the Taragurh hill in Ajmir, the country known to the authors of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata as that of Vir\u0101ta or Matsya (Economic Geology, chap. vi. p. 299). There are also other ancient mines in Uitwar, Jawur in Udaipur, and the Panchmahal district in Guzer\u0101t. At Joga, in the Hoshungabad district of the Central Provinces, south of the Nerbudda, near the Souhhudra, or Golden river, there is an old mine of argentiferous lead (galena) known as the Chandi-Khadan, or silver mine. None of these mines are worked now, but the name of \"silver-mine\" shows the purpose for which they were formerly used. There is also a mine mentioned in Hunter's Gazetteer, vol. vi. p. 142, at Jaora, in the Western Malwa Agency, and others are found in Bundelkund. Gold, in early times, must have chiefly come from Kashmir, though the mines in the Wainad and Mysore were also worked.\n\n\\(^4\\) India and the West in Old Days, p. 12. I have reckoned the sestertium or 1000 sesterces at \u00a38 17s. 1d. Prof. Weber attributes the extension of the trade between Alexandria and India to the discovery by Hippalus under Augustus of the trade winds, but these must have been known centuries before to the old Phoenician and Accadian navigators.\nThe country from which the above exports, except the sandal wood and gold, were sent, must have been Sindh, Rajputana, Guzerat, Malwa, and the country round the Gulf of Cambay, called in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata K\u0101rp\u0101sika,\u00b9 and the trade from the interior to Ujjen must have brought the produce of the valley of the Jumna and the Gangetic Doab. The trade in muslins and cottons, which proves that a large number of the people were skilled artisans, must, as I have shown, date back to at least 1700 B.C., and that there is strong reason to believe that it existed at a very much earlier period. The evidence as to the antiquity of the trade given by the use in Greece of the Tamil name for rice is corroborated by the names of the Indian goods brought to Solomon. Similar names to those given to the apes, ivory, peacocks, and aljun trees (sandal wood) in the Book of Kings, have been shown by Lassen and Max M\u00fcller to exist in Sanskrit, but Dr. Caldwell has shown that these were Tamil words before they became Sanskrit. Now the Aryans did not gain power in the Nerbudda and Tapti valleys till long after the Haihaya power was overthrown by Parasu-R\u0101ma, who killed the Haihaya king Arjuna, and conquered the country.\u00b2 This conquest had taken place very long before the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata was written, as the history of the war had become legendary. Before that conquest the town of S\u016brp\u0101raka was, we have seen, built by the Vidarbha king, and he was a vassal of the Haihayas. If it had been built after the conquest, it would have been ascribed to the Bhojas, whom we find at the time of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata ruling the country. The early use of the word Sindhu shows that the dialects derived from the Sanskrit had become the common language of the people on the Indus at a very remote period. It is impossible to say with any approach to exactness how long after Aryan tongues were spoken by the people of P\u0101t\u0101la, they were used by the inhabitants of Ujjen; but it was probably the Suvar\u1e47a of P\u0101t\u0101la and Saur\u0101sh\u1e6dra, the great Indian trading race, who\n\n\u00b9 Sabha (Dyuta) Parva, ii. p. 141.

Further evidence on these points will be given in the course of this paper, and here it must suffice to say that the evidence I have now brought forward appears to prove clearly: (1) That the early foreign trade of India with Egypt, Palestine, and the Accad-Semite empire of Assyria was nearly as active as that we find to have existed at the time of Arrian. (2) That the goods shown by the very earliest accounts extant to have been exported prove that the people had reached a very high stage of civilization. That they had established manufactures, worked mines, and grew crops, which showed they were skilful farmers. (3) That the people spoke Tamil dialects, and were Dravidians. And the evidence may also prove (4) that besides the trade with Western countries, they also traded with Ceylon and China.\n\nThe pearls mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions must have come from Ceylon, and so must those mentioned in the Rigveda,\\(^1\\) which must have been imported into the Vedic country when the ports were held by Dravidians, as the seaboard had not then been conquered by the semi-Aryan Bhojas. Much of the silk there spoken of was probably made from tusser cocoons which are still found in the Kandesh forests and those of Central India. The weaving of tusser silk is in Bengal one of the oldest of native industries, and the weavers must have learnt the art in the Western country, from whence, as will be shown, they came to Bengal.\\(^2\\) The mention of Chins among the subjects of King Bhagadatta of Pr\u0101gjyotisha\\(^3\\) makes it possible that there were some very early Chinese settlers on the Western coast, and they would probably trade in silk; but\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Rigv. i. 33. 8; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 53.\n\n\\(^2\\) Tusser silk, called by him Kaus\u0113ya, is mentioned by Hiouen Tsiang as worn constantly by the people of the Northern and Southern Panjab. Beal's Buddhist Records of the Western World, vol. i. pp. 75, 165, and 178. The name Kaus\u0113ya for tusser silk made from the wild cocoons found in the forest, and the similarity of the names, seems to show that the K\u0101s\u0101yam, or yellow robes of the Buddhist monks, were originally woven from the tusser or forest silk. Unbleached tusser is of the reddish yellow colour which is prescribed for these robes.\n\n\\(^3\\) Sabha (Digvijaya) Parva, xxvi. p. 79.\nbesides the Chinese silk, there was also, I believe, a considerable quantity of tusser silk exported.\n\nThe Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata shows that the dominant power in the country stretching from the Himalayas on the north-east to the Western coast, was that of the Haihaya kings, and it is to them and the Suvar\u1e47a that the organization of the trade is due. The earliest events referred to in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata are probably later than those recorded in all except the later Vedic hymns. They are those connected with the subversion of the Haihaya rule by the Bharatas and semi-Aryan Bhojas. The Aryan, or rather the semi-Aryan, allies of the Bharatas were the eighteen tribes of the Vrishnis or Bhojas.\u00b9 The next great event recorded in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is the contest between the tribes of the East and West, which did not take place till the Bhoja supremacy over the western country was quite complete. The Eastern tribes, when attacked by those coming from the West, retaliated, and Jarasandha, king of Magadha, and his generals Hansa, king of the Ku\u1e63ikas of Benares, and Dimvuka, also called Chitrasena,\u00b2 drove the Surasena out of Mathura and seized their territory.\u00b3 This they recovered partly by the help of Krishna, the Y\u0101dava hero and demi-god, but chiefly by that of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who were the same as the Surasena, and who went with Krishna to kill Jarasandha.\n\nThe account of this war, though less legendary than that of the contest with the Haihayas, is still greatly obscured by mythical matter. The war, as shown by the account of the conquest of Mathura by Jarasandha, and of the expedition of \u015ai\u015bupala, king of Chedi, against Dv\u0101raka,\u2074 was a very long business, but we only have detailed accounts of the advance of the Eastern powers westward. The recovery of their dominions by the Western tribes is resolved into the expedition of Krishna, accompanied only by the five P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, and the killing of Jarasandha in single combat by Bh\u012bma.\u2075\n\n\u00b9 Sabha (Rajasuyarambha) Parva, xiv. p. 48.\n\u00b2 Sabha (Jarasandha-badha) Parva, xxii. p. 69.

This splendid military position provided those who held it with an excellent site for an encampment, from whence they could not only defend themselves against invaders coming from the north, but could also keep the turbulent tribes of the country of the five rivers (the Panjab) in order; control the Gangetic Doab, containing the largest extent of fertile and valuable land in Northern India, and command the routes leading to the sea.\n\nThe Purus.\u2014Having in this long digression dealt with the questions relating to the antiquity and dimensions of the Indian trade relating to the purposes of this paper, and sketched the historical series of events recorded in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, I will now return to the account of the Purus. Puru, said to be the ancestor of the tribe, is described as the son of Yay\u0101ti, but his mother was Sharmisht\u0101, daughter of the Asura (Dravidian) king Vrishaparva. In another account the younger brother of Vrishaparva is said to have become on earth \u015aalya, who was king of the Madras, whom we have seen were a branch of the Takshakas or Takkas of the Northern Panjab, and were probably the Ajas mentioned in the Rigveda, for \u015aalya\u2019s name as an Asura is said to have been Ajaka. Yay\u0101ti is said to have been accepted as her husband by Devayani, daughter of the Rishi Sukra or Usana, also called Bh\u0101rgava, who was the son of Bhrigu. Devayani had two sons, Yadu and Turvasu. The mother of Druhyu, Anu and Puru, the remaining three sons of Yay\u0101ti, was Sharmisht\u0101, who, though the daughter of a king, became waiting-maid to Devayani. The order of birth given in the long history of the relations between Yay\u0101ti and his wives is repeated again in the more elaborate of the two genealogies.\n\n1 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, lxvii. p. 194.\n2 Rigv. vii. 18, 19.\n3 The river flowing through the territory of which \u015a\u0101kala, the Madra capital, was the chief town, is still called Ajuk, or Ayak.\n4 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, lxv. p. 191.\n5 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, lxxv. to lxxxv. pp. 228 to 260.\nof the Purus given in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata.\\(^1\\) It is especially insisted on owing to Puru being chosen as Yay\u0101ti's heir to the exclusion of his elder and better born brothers, because he gave his youth to restore his father's strength. In the list of the tribes given in the Rigveda, they are named in the same order as in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata,\\(^2\\) and this is apparently a strong reason for believing that the same tradition as that recorded in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata was also present in the mind of the writer of the Vedic hymn, otherwise a race which attained such importance in Vedic times as the Purus would not have been mentioned as last in the list of the tribes.\n\nThe account of the birth of the five brothers given in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata concludes by saying that the sons of Yadu are known by the name of Y\u0101davas, those of Turvasu as Yavanas, those of Druhyu as the Bhojas, and those of Anu as the Mleccha or barbarous tribes, while the Purus were the Pauravas. I hope to show in the course of this paper that it is probable that the position of the several tribes in the list is not fortuitous, but involves an important historical statement as to the geographical position of the tribes in Vedic times. Thus the Yadu-Turvasu are the southern tribes which lived in the country between the Indus and the Jumna south of the desert, and who were most nearly connected with the Aryans on the Sarasvat\u012b. The Bhojas, the cattle-herding tribes which lived along the five rivers, the Indus, and proceeded afterwards southward to the valleys of the Nerbudda and Tapt\u012b, while the Anu and Puru held the country north of the Purush\u1e47\u012b or R\u0101v\u012b. From this account of the descent of the Purus one thing is clear, that the authors of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata did not think they had any claims to Aryan descent.\n\nTheir importance in Vedic times is shown by the prominent place they occupy in the Rigveda. While Divodasa, the great T\u1e5btsu king, is continually spoken of as conquering by the help of Indra the mountain tribes of the\n\n\\(^1\\) Adi (Sambhava) Parva, xcv. p. 283.\n\\(^2\\) Rigv. i. 108, 8. This hymn is said to have been written by Kutsa the Puru. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 122.\n\u015aambara, Kutsa, the Puru king, is not less frequently mentioned. He is called Kutsa, the son of Arjuna (the fair hero),\u00b9 and Purukutsa or Kutsa the Puru.\u00b2 He is the charioteer of Indra,\u00b3 when the latter as the cloud-god goes forth to destroy \u015auschna, the greedy fiend of drought, and in other passages he is united with Indra, they both going together in one chariot for the same purpose.\u2074 Kutsa is also mentioned in the Rigveda as commanding the Vetasu when they defeated the Tugra. This victory is referred to three times,\u2075 and all the passages seem to speak of the same event. In two of these passages Kutsa is called Dasadyu, or the ten-fold bright one, and the leadership of Kutsa seems distinctly to show that the Vetasu were either a clan of the Puru tribe, or another name for the whole tribe, but I can find no evidence tending to clear up the difficulty, or any identification of the clan in any of the authorities I have consulted.\n\nIt was through the country of the Tugra, who were certainly the same tribe as the Trigarta of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, that the Aryans must have passed in their progress along the base of the Himalayas to the upper waters of the Sarasvat\u012b. To do this they must have crossed the Julundhur Doab, between the Sutlej and Bias, after they emerged from the hills, and this was the country of the Trigarta.\u2076 The victory of the Vetasu over the Tugra may have been that gained by the advancing Aryans and their allies in their march to the Sarasvat\u012b. It can hardly have been the repulse of one of the cattle-raids for which the Trigarta were afterwards so famous.\u2077 Throughout the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata the Trigarta are one of the most powerful tribes of the northern Punjab, and the victory of the Aryans and Purus over them must have\n\n\u00b9 Rigv. i. 112. 23; vii. 19. 2; viii. 1. 2.\n\u00b2 Rigv. vi. 20. 10; i. 174. 2.\n\u00b3 Rigv. ii. 19. 6.\n\u2074 Rigv. vi. 20. 5; vi. 31. 3; iv. 16. 10-12.\n\u2075 Rigv. i. 33. 14 and 15; vi. 26. 4; x. 49. 4.\n\u2076 Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, pp. 137-139.\n\u2077 See for instance the raid by the Trigarta into the Matsya country to seize their cattle. Vir\u0101\u1e6da (Goharana) Parva, xxv. to lxvi. pp. 65 to 168.\nbeen considered well worthy of record in the battle-songs of the Aryan bards.\n\nThat the Tugra, who are called in the Rigveda the sons of the serpent,\\(^1\\) did not always remain at feud with the Vetasus and Aryans, is shown in another passage,\\(^2\\) where the Vetasus, the Da\u1e63oni,\\(^3\\) and Tugra are said to have been sent by Indra with all their followers to help Dyotana (the bright one), or in other words to help the Aryans. This mention of the Vetasus with other non-Aryan tribes seems to show that they were not considered Aryans by the authors of the Rigveda.\n\nThat Kutsa was not an Aryan, but was connected with the snake-worshipping tribes, appears likely from a tradition recorded in the Vish\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a,\\(^4\\) where Purukutsa is said to have obtained power to conquer the Gandharva at the request of the snake-gods. This is evidently the same legend as that referred to in the Rigveda, where Kutsa, the son of Arjuna (the fair hero), is said by the help of Indra to have conquered the Gandharva.\\(^5\\) Now in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata Gandharv\u012b and Rohin\u012b are said to have been the daughters of Surav\u012b,\\(^6\\) Rohin\u012b being the mother of cows, and Gandharv\u012b of horses. The Greek writers call the inhabitants of Gandh\u0101ra, which is the ancient name of the Kabul valley and the first Indian territory conquered by Alexander the Great, Assakinoi,\\(^7\\) and this name is evidently the same as the A\u015bvaka or cavalry\\(^8\\) of the Sanskrit geographers, and of the people described by Hiouen Tsiang as living in the north of India, and whose king he calls A\u015bvapati, or the lord of horses,\\(^9\\) A\u015bva being the Sanskrit for horse. The conquest\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Rigv. i. 33. 15.\n\\(^2\\) Rigv. vi. 20. 8.\n\\(^3\\) The Da\u1e63oni are in Atharva Veda 10. 4. 4, called powerful serpents, Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 95.\n\\(^4\\) Vish\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a, bk. iv.\n\\(^5\\) Rigv. viii. 1. 11.\n\\(^6\\) \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, lxvi. p. 193.\n\\(^7\\) Arrian, Indika, chap. i.\n\\(^8\\) Vivien de St.-Martin, \u00c9tude sur la G\u00e9ographie Grecque et Latine de l\u2019Inde, pp. 376-8.\n\\(^9\\) Beal, Records of the Western World, vol. i. p. 13.\nof the Gandharvi by Kutsa, spoken of in the Rigveda, and Vish\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a, therefore merely means the conquest of the Gandh\u0101rvi or horse-owning tribes of the Kabul valley.\n\nIn considering the nationality of Kutsa and the Purus there is another point which must be noticed. When the Purus are mentioned by Vasishtha in the account of the battle of the ten kings,\\(^1\\) they are called \"m\u1e5bdhav\u0101c.\" This epithet literally means \"speaking softly,\" and is so interpreted by Sayana, the great Vedic commentator, but, as shown by Zimmer,\\(^2\\) it is used in all the places in which it occurs in the Rigveda in speaking of the Dasyus or people of the country, and seems to imply that they spoke a different language, and not, as Roth and Grassmann interpret it, that they spoke with women's tongues, or were abusive. The whole evidence is very conflicting. There appears to be little doubt that Kutsa and the Purus were not Aryans, but if not, who were they? The mention of Kutsa as the charioteer of Indra looks as if he was a Gandh\u0101rva, who were the charioteers par excellence; but against this supposition is to be set the fact that he conquered the Gandh\u0101rva. Again, when Kuts\u0101 is named as the charioteer of Indra, he is always spoken of as destroying \u015auschna, the fiend of drought, and this seems clearly to mean that he and his fellow-tribesmen were especially skilled in irrigation, and this description is certainly applicable to the present representatives of the Gandh\u0101ri, who live in Kandahar,\\(^3\\) which is called after them, and are especially good farmers. The whole question will be further considered again when I have concluded the historical account of the Purus, and all that I can say at present is that apparently Kutsa and certainly the Purus were not Aryans. Kutsa seems to have belonged to one of the agricultural tribes of Central Asia, who, in the thirsty lands of that country, had gained great experience in the best methods of\n\n\\(^1\\) Rigv. vii. 18. 13.\n\\(^2\\) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 114.\n\\(^3\\) India and the West in Old Days, by Prof. A. Weber, p. 6 note.\nsupplying water to the crops, and who imparted that knowledge to the people of India. This would seem to imply a connection between Kutsa and the Kurus, who, as I shall show later on, were the ancestors of the chief agricultural tribes of North India, but who were certainly a race of very early immigrants belonging to one of the great families who trace their descent from the five chief Snake gods.\n\nWhen we leave Kutsa and come to his successor Tr\u0101sadasyu, we find ourselves in the presence of quite a different personage. Tr\u0101sadasyu is not a demi-god like Kutsa, but a powerful monarch described as a Samraj or king of kings.\\(^1\\) It appears from one passage that he was not, as he is elsewhere stated to be, the son of Kutsa, but the son of Kutsa's daughter, the feminine Purukutsi, and not the masculine Purukutsa, being used.\\(^2\\) He was apparently without doubt the king of Gandh\u0101ra, and his capital seems to have been on the river Swat, as in Rigv. viii. 19, 36, the bard praises Tr\u0101sadasyu for the horse and cattle\\(^3\\) he had given him, and which Chyava took across the ford of the Soastos or Swat, and brought to him. There can be little doubt that this capital was the ancient city of Hastinagur. General Cunningham interprets the name to mean eight cities, and shows that it is still applied to the eight towns of Tangi, Shirpao, Umrzai, Urmanzai, Rajur, Charsuda, and Parang,\\(^4\\) on the north bank of the Swat. He identifies it with the great city called by the Greek writers Peukalaotis, Proklais, or Peukelas, and by the Sanskrit writers Pushkalavati, which held out for thirty days against the forces of Alexander the Great under Heph\u00e6stion. This city is said by Arrian to have been the capital of a chief called Astes,\\(^5\\) and it was, I believe, the original Hastinapole of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, which\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Rigv. viii. 19, 32 and 36; i. 112, 14.\n\n\\(^2\\) Rigv. vii. 19, 3.\n\n\\(^3\\) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 107, translates the word *vadh\u016b* \"maidens,\" but cattle is much the most probable translation.

I shall show reasons in another part of this paper for doubting that Hashti or Hastinagur means the eight cities. I believe it means the city of Ashti, Ashti being, as I shall show, pp. 307, 308, the sun.\n\n\\(^5\\) Arrian, Anabasis, iv, 22.\nis said to have been built by King Hasti.\\(^1\\) The passage I have quoted above from the Rigveda gives strong grounds for believing that this city was the earliest capital of the Purus, and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata makes this conclusion almost a certainty. It is true that Hastinapore, the capital of the Kauravyas, is in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata placed on the Ganges.\\(^2\\) This Hastinapore on the Ganges may be the city whose ruins are found on the banks of the old Ganges in the Mirat district, which is said to have once been Hastinapore. But this city was not the Kauravya capital, but may have been that of the P\u0101ndava kings after the Kauravyas had been finally defeated in the great war which forms the principal subject of the epic narrative. However true this may be, it is quite impossible that Hastinapore on the Ganges could have been the Kauravya capital before they had conquered Ahikshetra or northern Panch\u0101la. A long account of the conquest is given in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata,\\(^3\\) and till it was effected the Kauravya rule did not extend beyond the limits of Kurukshetra, which was on the western bank of the Jumna, and they could not have made Hastinapore their capital, as it was in their enemy\u2019s country. Kurukshetra was the frontier outpost of the Kurus, from whence they and their Aryan allies kept guard against the snake-races encamped in the province of Ahikshetra, or the field of the snakes (ahi) on the opposite bank of the river. They too apparently had a snake city in their territory, for the town of N\u0101gapura, or city of the snakes, from whence the Trigartas and Kauravyas went forth to seize the cattle of the Matsya, and where the Kauravya forces assembled before the last great contest with the P\u0101ndavas,\\(^4\\) seems to have been situated in Kurukshetra, on the west bank of the Jumna.\n\nAll the principal allies of the Kauravyas, Salya, king of the Madras, and Suvala, the son of the Gandh\u0101ri king, lived in the Northern Punjab and far away from Panch\u0101la, and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, xcv. p. 284.\n\\(^2\\) \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, cxxxii. p. 375.\n\\(^3\\) \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, p. 140.\n\\(^4\\) Vi\u015b\u0101la (Goharana) Parva, xxv. p. 65, Udyoga (Bhagavatya) Parva, cxlvii. p. 428.\ntheir capital must have been in the same part of the country. When we find in Hashtinagur or Hashtinapore, a city with the same name as the Kauravya capital, situated on the Swat, where the Puru capital is placed in the Rigveda, and in the middle of the nations most intimately allied with the Kuru-Purus, it is impossible not to believe that this is the original chief city of the tribe from whence the later town in the Mirat district took its name.\n\nTo return to the Rigveda, we find that in the time of Purukutsa the Aryans had made their way through the Tugra or Trigarta country, and had settled themselves on the Sarasvat\u012b. We find that they were in strict alliance with Tr\u0101sadasyu, king of the Purus, Kutsa\u2019s successor, and we may fairly conclude that the Aryans and the rulers of the Gandh\u0101ra country had between them acquired supreme influence over all the districts intervening between Gandh\u0101ra and the Julundhar Doab, the land of the Trigartas. This was the territory of the Takkas or Takshakas of Takkasil\u0101 (the rock (sil\u0101) of the Takkas). In the time of Hiouen Tsiang this people were independent, and were ruled by their native sovereigns living in Kashmir.\u00b9 Hiouen Tsiang says that the country was formerly governed by the king of Kapisa or Kabul. In the time of Alexander the Great, the Gandh\u0101ri of Kabul seem to have controlled the people of Takkasil\u0101, which was then the capital of the Takka province. The Takkas made no resistance after he had conquered the Gandh\u0101ra country, and their prince, called Taxilus by the Greeks, became Alexander\u2019s active ally. When the Aryans entered India, the Takkas seem to have been independent, and it was their hill fortresses that Divodasa took from the Puru or Gandh\u0101ri king. After the Aryans reached the Sarasvat\u012b, they apparently settled there as the advanced guard of the forces of the northern Gandh\u0101ri and Purus; while Tr\u0101sadasyu, the son of Kutsa\u2019s daughter, ruled the country from his capital on the Swat. Tr\u0101sadasyu consolidated and secured the conquests made by Divodasa and\n\n\u00b9 Beal, Records of the Western World, vol. i. p. 166.\nKutsa, besides perhaps adding to his own dominions, as in a hymn of Vasishtha Tr\u0101sadasyu is said to have gained territory in his wars.\\(^1\\) It is only in the time of Tr\u0101sadasyu\u2019s son Trkshi or Riksha, that we find an agreement between the Vedic genealogies and those in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata,\\(^2\\) but as the earlier kings in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata lists were, as I shall show later on, Bh\u0101rata kings ruling over the country along the Ganges, it is not to be expected that the names of kings of the Kabul country should appear in them. Tr\u0101sadasyu\u2019s son is called Trkshi in two places,\\(^3\\) but the name Riksha, the son of \u0100rksha the sun, occurs in another hymn where he is called the father of \u015arutarvan, also called Chavisthta.\\(^4\\) From this last hymn, it appears that his dominions extended to the Purush\u1e47\u012b, as it is to this river that the bard sings the praises of Chavisthta. It would appear probable that the correct name of the son of Tr\u0101sadasyu was Trkshi or Taruksha, a name which appears in another hymn as that of a prince who, together with Balbutha the Dasu, or native of the country, gave the bard a hundred buffaloes.\\(^5\\) The name Riksha was probably given to him after he had accepted the worship of the \u0100nava Agni which is mentioned in the hymn where he is called Riksha; but the whole subject will be discussed later on.\n\nIt was apparently in \u015arutarvan\u2019s reign that the connection with the Bh\u0101ratas began; for that there was a close and intimate alliance between the families of the kings of the Eastern and Western Bh\u0101ratas and the Kuru kings there can be no doubt. Throughout the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata both the Kau-ravya and P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava chiefs are called Bh\u0101ratas, and addressed as belonging to the Bh\u0101rata race. The whole question is\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Rigv. vii. 19, 3. The name Tr\u0101sadasyu is generally translated as meaning he who makes his foes to tremble, but I would submit that Tr\u0101sa the Dasyu is much more probably the correct translation. He was to the Aryans the great Dasyu and their especial ally. His name, as he was not an Aryan, would not have had any meaning in Sanskrit, and just as the Greeks called the prince of the Takkas 'taxilus, the Aryans would have called the great northern king the Dasyu, the representative of the native races.\n\n\\(^2\\) For these genealogies see Appendix A.\n\n\\(^3\\) Rigv. xiii. 22, 7; vi. 46, 8.\n\n\\(^4\\) Rigv. viii. 74, 4 and 15.\n\n\\(^5\\) Rigv. viii. 46, 32.\none of great difficulty, arising from the evident distortion of the genealogies to make the Bh\u0101rata kings descendants of the sun-hero Riksha. The name Riksha occurs twice in these genealogies,\\(^1\\) once as the first of a series of kings, which will be shown later on to be a list in the form of a genealogy of the races which united formed that called Bh\u0101rata. The sun-hero Riksha, king of the northern Kurus or Kauravyas, married Jwala, the daughter of Takshaka. In other words, the Kurus allied themselves with the Takshakas, and became, as I have shown they did, the rulers of the Takka country. Their son married the Sarasvat\u012b, and the grandson of Matinara and the Sarasvat\u012b was Ilina or Ila, who, as will be shown later on, was the original progenitor of the races descended from Yay\u0101ti.\n\nThe Riksha, whose name is entered in this part of the genealogy, is a wholly mythical personage, and the really intimate alliance between the Kurus, Bh\u0101ratas, and the Aryans on the Sarasvat\u012b, did not take place till Samvar\u0101\u1e47a, the son of the second Riksha, who is a much more real person than the first, allied himself with the Aryans, or, as stated in the genealogies, married Tapati, daughter of Vivaswan, the Sun, and became the father of Kuru. Riksha, Samvar\u0101\u1e47a\u2019s father, was probably Triksha or Riksha, the son of Tr\u0101sadasyu. There is no direct evidence to prove whether Samvar\u0101\u1e47a and \u015arutarvan were one and the same person. The only mention of Samvar\u0101\u1e47a in the Rigveda is in a late hymn, where the successors of Samvar\u0101\u1e47a are spoken of.\\(^2\\) It seems, however, exceedingly probable that the great war mentioned in one of the genealogies in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, in which the Panch\u0101las attacked Samvar\u0101\u1e47a and drove him and the Bh\u0101ratas back to the Indus, is the same as that in which the battle of the ten kings took place.\\(^3\\)\n\nWar of the Ten Kings.\u2014This war, in which the T\u1e5btsus were opposed to their earlier allies the Purus, occurred certainly long after the time of Tr\u0101sadasyu, as in the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See Genealogies in Appendix A.\n\n\\(^2\\) Rigv. viii. 51. 1.\n\n\\(^3\\) \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, xciv. p. 280.\nsame hymn in which Vasishtha asks Indra to give Sudas, son of Divodasa, and leader of the Trtsus in the defeat of the ten kings, the same help he formerly gave to his predecessors, the conquests of Trasadasyu are treated as an old story.\u00b9 Neither \u0160rutarvan nor Samvarana are mentioned as leaders among the tribes conquered by Sudas; the only leaders mentioned being Yakshu, chief of the Turvasus,\u00b2 and Kavasha of the Vaikarna;\u00b3 but the Kuru were apparently one of the two tribes called collectively Vaikarna, and Kavasha is probably much more like the real name of the Kuru king than the arianized Samvarana; which appears to be a honorific title like Samraj, and to mean a king of a number of castes or races (varna) (collected) together (sama). In that sense it might be the Sanskrit term used for the king of the Vaikarna or two united tribes of the Kurus and Takkas. The Ajas, who are represented later on as paying tribute of horses\u2019 heads to the Trtsus, after the battle,\u2074 may perhaps, as I have before stated, be the Madra section of the Takkas.\n\nThere are in the Rigveda two hymns giving an account of the war from the victor\u2019s point of view. They are both written by Vasishtha, the priest and bard of the Trtsu. One is a hymn to Indra giving a graphic account of the battle,\u2075 and the other addressed to Indra-Varuna, not entering into details, but giving most important information as to the allies of the Trtsus.\u2076 The first verse of the latter of these two hymns, as translated by Roth,\u2077 runs as follows: \u201cThose rejoicing in battle, advance with broad spears, looking to you (Indra-Varuna) and your friendship. You have overthrown opponents, oppressors and enemies. With your protection, Indra and Varuna, you have guarded Sudas.\u201d The words translated here \u201cwith broad spears\u201d are \u201cprthu-parsava,\u201d and those translated \u201copponents, oppressors and enemies,\u201d\n\n\u00b9 Rigv. vii. 19, 3.\n\u00b2 Rigv. vii. 18, 6.\n\u00b3 Rigv. vii. 18, 12; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 127.\n\u2074 Rigv. vii. 18, 19.\n\u2075 Rigv. vii. 18.\n\u2076 Rigv. vii. 83.\n\u2077 Roth, zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Veda, p. 129.\nare \"D\u0101sa, V\u1e5btra and \u0100ri\u0101ni.\" With regard to this last translation, I will only remark that I cannot see why the words should not be translated according to the meaning they usually bear in the Rigveda, that is, D\u0101sus or people of the country, V\u1e5btra or the snake races (Indra is the great killer of V\u1e5btra, the snakes), and \u0100ri\u0101ni Aryans.\\(^1\\) There is considerable controversy as to the meaning of the words \"P\u1e5bthu parsava.\" Zimmer,\\(^2\\) commenting on the passage, says that, according to Sayana, \"parsu\" means bill-hooks or axes, and \"p\u1e5bthu\" means broad. Roth in his translation merely follows Sayana. Ludwig, on the other hand, makes P\u1e5bthu Parsu to mean two tribes, and thinks that P\u1e5bthu means the Parthians, and Parsu the Persians. Zimmer, thinking it impossible that the Parthians and Persians should have done what Alexander the Great failed to do, and have penetrated into India as far south as the Sarasvat\u012b, retains Sayana's and Roth's interpretation.\n\nI must say that it seems to me that Ludwig's translation is much more in accordance with probability and historical evidence than the traditional translation. Why should the poet talk of broad spears and broad axes? Surely in speaking of the great war it is much more likely that he should mention the tribes engaged in it, and in doing so he would naturally name the two chief races of the Aryan confederacy. We know from the poem giving the detailed account of the battle that the Aryans had allies. If it can be proved that any tribes bearing the names P\u1e5bthu and Parsu existed in Vedic times in the Vedic country, and that they probably took part in the war, it is surely more probable that the poet should name them rather than substitute an unmeaning and undistinctive epithet for the tribal names of the people referred to.\n\nIt can be proved from other passages in the Rigveda that there were two tribes called P\u1e5bthu and Parsu; and that these\n\n\\(^1\\) Indra is throughout the Rigveda the warrior-god, and the victors in every contest, whether Aryans or non-Aryans, ascribe their success to Indra.

We read of a king K\u0101n\u012bta, who is called Prthu\u1e63ravas\u00b9 (the glory of the Prthus), and in another hymn the S\u1e5bnjaya are called Prthu.\u00b2 The bard calls the twenty pair of chariot-cattle with their equipments given to him by the leader of the S\u1e5bnjayas the gift of the Prthu race, and throughout the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata the S\u1e5bnjayas are spoken of as one with the Panch\u0101las.\u00b3\n\nThat these Prthu or Panch\u0101las were Parthians is, I would submit, not by any means so improbable as it appears to be to Zimmer. There is in the Rigveda clear proof that the Aryan Trtsus had among their allies in this war a people closely allied to the tribes of horsemen called Parthians in Central Asia. In the detailed account of the battle of the ten kings the Paktha are named among the allies of the Trtsu.\u2074 The Paktha, as Zimmer shows,\u2075 are evidently the same people whom Herodotus calls \u03a0\u03ac\u03ba\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, whose capital was \u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c0\u03b1\u03c0\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2. This city is called by Hecataeus a Gandaric city,\u2076 and the people are said to live near the Darda of Kashmir. K\u0101syapa or K\u0101syakapura\u2077 was on the Indus, or rather on the Chen\u0101b, one of its chief tributaries, as it was thence that Scylax, Darius's general, sailed on his voyage down the Indus in 509 B.C. K\u0101syapa or K\u0101syapura is one of the names of Multan,\u2078 and it was there that a general, coming down the Indus with an army, would naturally embark on the river,\n\n\u00b9 Rigv. viii. 46. 21 and 24. A king called Prthusravasa is named in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, as the father of K\u0101m\u0101, queen of Ayuta-Nayi, one of the Bharata.

The name Kasyapura proves, as I shall show later on when I come to speak of the Gandh\u0101ri, that this tribe had acquired sufficient influence and power there to call the city of the Malli by their own name; but this probably took place long after the battle of the ten kings. At the time of that battle the Paktha or Paktes were probably the same people as the Chitraratha of the Rigveda, and lived in the Northern Panch\u0101la country, close to the Trtsus.\n\n\u2077 Weber, India and the West in Old Days, p. 6.\n\n\u2078 Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, p. 232; Alberni's India, edited and translated by Prof. E. Sachau, chap. xxix. vol. i. p. 298.\nas it would be easier to sail down the stream than march through the desert. Therefore, according to Herodotus and Hecataeus, the \u03a0\u03ac\u03ba\u03c4\u03c5\u03b5\u03c2, who lived near K\u0101\u015byapura, were Gandh\u0101ri, and it is they who were the Paktha, the allies of the T\u1e5btsus. I have before spoken of the connection between the Chitraratha, whom we find fighting with the Aryan armies against the Yadu Turvasu, and the Gandharvi, and also of that between the Gandharvi and Gandh\u0101ri. And now we find the Paktha or Afghans, who were also Gandh\u0101ri, allied with the Aryans and fighting on their side, just as the Chitraratha fought on the side of the Arna. Surely the probability is that these Paktha, who as Gandh\u0101ri are also called Asvaka or the cavaliers, were the same tribe as the Parthians, who were the cavalry of Central Asia. When to these arguments are added the facts that the Paneh\u0101la or S\u1e5b\u1e47jayas are said to be of the Pr\u0325thu race, and that as sons of Pr\u0325thu they would be called P\u0101rtha, the identification becomes nearly certain. Throughout the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata the hero Arjuna is continually called P\u0101rtha, but this appellation is explained in the poem by stating that his mother\u2019s name was Pr\u0325thu. But this supernatural birth was merely a legend, invented to make the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas descendants of the Sun.\n\nTo sum up the arguments here adduced, I would urge that if it is admitted that the Paktha probably were the same tribe as are elsewhere called Gandh\u0101ri, \u0100\u1e63vaka,\u00b9 and Chitraratha, it is also exceedingly probable that they were the tribe called Partha, S\u1e5b\u1e47jaya or Panch\u0101la. If it be further admitted that the defeat of Samvara\u1e47a, recorded in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, and the battle of the ten kings, are one and the same event, the statement of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata that Samvara\u1e47a was defeated by the Panch\u0101las would quite agree with the accounts in the Rigveda where the Pr\u0325thu are named as one of the chief of the two victorious tribes. It is not by any means impossible that an Indian tribe should call themselves P\u0101rtha, as their forefathers did in Central Asia. On\n\n\u00b9 In the Brihat Sanhita, 22. 23, they are spoken of as Asmaka, and are mentioned as living next to the Madras (translation by Prof. Kern, J.R.A.S. Vol. V. p. 85).\nthe contrary, it is exceedingly probable that for a long time after entering India they would use the ancestral name to which they had always been accustomed. The name \u1f08\u03c1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 was known to Herodotus,\u00b9 and though the term was modified subsequently, it is evidently the oldest form of the name, and this would probably have been still retained by those sections of the tribe who emigrated south-west to India.\n\nIn another hymn\u00b2 the Yadus are called Par\u1e63u, and it would appear to be a general name for the \u0100ryan people. There is strong evidence of the early and intimate connection between the Zoroastrian Persians and the people on the banks of the Indus, in the legend in the Bh\u0101vishya Pur\u0101\u1e47a, which tells how \u015aamba, the son of Krishna, brought Magi from \u015aakadvipa to officiate in the Temple of the Sun at Multan.\u00b3 I cannot see any improbability in \u0100ryan Sun-worshippers, who came from Ir\u0101n, maintaining relations with those they left behind in their original home. The arguments as to their retention of their ancient name are exactly similar to those I have used in the case of the Parthians. \u1f19\u03c1\u03c3\u03b1,\u2074 the vocative of the Greek \u1f19\u03c1\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, used by Herodotus, is the same word as Par\u1e63u, and must have been the original name of the Persians. Their successors, the P\u0101rsis, who came into India from Persia at the time of the Mahommedan conquest, have always continued to call themselves P\u0101rsis or Persians, and I do not see why their predecessors should not have done the same thing. The difference in the case of the early \u0100ryans is that their national name became obscured and forgotten when they became amalgamated with the aboriginal tribes. Up to the time of the battle of the ten kings, the \u0100ryans had been a distinct people; but after this victory, and their subsequent alliance with the Kurus, the process of uniting the \u0100ryans with the people of the country began, and the great Brahmin conception of a number of subordinate tribes ruled by a very small \u0100ryan minority began to be evolved. The war in\n\n\u00b9 Herod. 101. 93.\n\u00b2 Rigv. 6. 46.\n\u00b3 Prof. A. Weber, India and the West in Old Days, p. 20.\n\u2074 Liddell and Scott, \u1f19\u03c1\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2.\nwhich the battle of the ten kings took place is traditionally supposed to have originated out of the religious differences between the schools of Vasishtha and Visv\u0101mitra; but this seems to be exceedingly doubtful. The great dispute between the strict Br\u0101hm\u012bns of Vasishtha\u2019s school and those who followed the more liberal doctrines identified with Visv\u0101mitra, belonged to a much later time than that I am now writing about. The great quarrel only arose long after Aryan supremacy had been accepted, and the Brahmin conception that it is intellect, tact, and perseverance which rules the world, had been shown to be justified by results. It could not have occurred at an earlier period, nor before the Aryan doctrines had been formulated, consolidated, discussed, and preached throughout the country by successive schools of Brahmins, and it probably belonged to the time of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, or somewhat after that date, as the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as are more liberal than the law-books. When the battle of the ten kings took place, Brahmins and Brahminism were unknown. The Aryans were merely a tribe among others, who had, like their neighbours, their tribal gods. But there was an essential difference between their tribal gods and those of their neighbours who worshipped the earth under the symbol of the snake or phallus. The early form of this latter religion was very different from the later form of \u015aiva-worship, and was more immediately derived from the original totemistic ideas. The snake-worshipping races regarded the snake as their father, as they had previously thought their totemistic gods to be their ancestors; but the diversified ancestral species of totemism had now become one species, composed of individual snakes, each of whom was named and called the father of a separate tribe. With the Aryans the idea of the paternity of their god was also present, but it was the heaven which was their father and mother, and not the earth. This idea was derived from the totemistic phase of thought through which they, like all Asiatic tribes, appear to have passed in their progress towards civilization. It lay at the bottom of the Aryan religion, and its further development resulted in the worship of the most powerful of the\noffspring of the sky. These were the sun and the god of the clouds and rain. It was in these conceptions that dualism originated, but the dualism of the Indian Aryans was not that of the later Zoroastrians. The Zoroastrians held the two powers to represent the two spirits of good and evil, mutually opposed to and working against one another. The evil spirit working ill, while the good spirit counteracted its influence, and the evil spirit, on the other hand, tried to spoil the work done by the good deity.\n\nThe Aryan dualism was quite different from this doctrine. The sun and fire and the god of clouds and rain were, in certain aspects, the most beneficent, and in others the most destructive agents, and both were alike bad and good. It was the sun and fire which gave life, light, and heat; but it was also the sun which burnt up the pasturage, and made a rich pastoral country a desert. It was these latter evil influences which Indra, the rain-god, counteracted; but he again, if unchecked by the sun, produced floods, which destroyed both crops and cattle. Both gods were therefore asked for benefits, and both propitiated by sacrifices, to induce them to abstain from hurting their worshippers. In the next stage of development Indra, Sakra,\\(^1\\) or in popular parlance Sakko, became the god of the warriors; but he then ceased to be a purely Aryan god. Aryan military prowess inspired all the neighbouring tribes with a great reverence for the Aryan war-god, and he accordingly became the god invoked by all the military tribes, whether Aryan or non-Aryan; and when they were successful, their success was ascribed to Indra. Thus we find in the Rigveda Indra praised for giving victory to the Yadu-Turvasu over the Aryan Arna and Chitr\u0101ratha.\\(^2\\) Again, it was by Indra's help that the \u015ar\u016bjaya defeated the Turvasu and Vrishivants.\\(^3\\) It was Indra who encouraged the Bhrigus and Yatis (the sons of Yay\u0101ti),\\(^4\\) and it was the Yatis and Bhrigus who were dear\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Sakra was most probably the warrior god of the Sakas, Scythians or Bhojas, worshipped under the symbol of the sword. He became amalgamated with Indra, the Aryan god of the clouds and rain.\n\n\\(^2\\) Rigv. iv. 30. 18.\n\n\\(^3\\) Rigv. vi. 27. 5.\n\n\\(^4\\) Rigv. viii. 3. 9.\nto Indra. But when Indra ceased to be the exclusively Aryan god, and came to be worshipped by non-Aryan tribes, a similar process was followed in the development of sun-worship. The Sun-god became Krishna, the sun-god of the black (Krishna) races, and it was this last movement which produced the conflict between the schools of Vasishtha and Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitra. The school of Vasishtha, wishing to confine sun worship to those they considered Aryans, and to keep them as a class apart from the rest of the people; while the Brahmans of Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitra's school wished all the people to become sun-worshippers like the Aryans. It is very doubtful if these or other religious differences ever caused war in India till a very much later period, and they certainly did not cause it at the time I am now discussing. The question at issue was a purely political one, as to whether the northern and western tribes should crush the confederacy of the Aryan Trtsu and their allies. The Aryan Trtsu and the Panch\u0101las evidently dreaded the growing power of the Kurus and Takkas, when strengthened by their alliance with the Bh\u0101ratas, while the northern and western tribes were no less jealous of the central races, and perhaps saw the political consequences that would probably follow the Aryan missionary propaganda, which had already begun in Vedic times. It is, I believe, the Kuru-Takkas who are named as Vaikarna in the Vedic account of the battle. Zimmer considers these people to be the Kuru-Krivi, afterwards the Kuru-Panch\u0101la; but this appears to me not to be tenable. There is no evidence that the Panch\u0101la, who were, according to the \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, once called Krivi, ever ruled the country north of the Purush\u1e47\u012b, which, at the time of the war, we know belonged to the Kuru kingdom, and there is distinct evidence that the Vaikarna were a people living in the Kashmir country. Zimmer quotes Hemachandra as giving Kashmir as the translation of Vikarnika, and I have already shown the relations between the Takkas of Kashmir and the rulers of the Swat country, and how intimately they\n\n1 Rigv. viii. 6. 18.\n2 Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 103.\nwere allied at the time of the war. That the Bh\u0101rata joined the alliance is made certain by the Rigveda. One of the hymns of Vasishtha's Mandala, referring to the battle of the ten kings, tells how the Trtsus there drove the weak Bh\u0101ratas before them like oxen,\\(^1\\) and how the Trtsu enlarged their dominions at their expense.\n\nThe names of the tribes composing the alliance against the Aryans and Panchalas are given in full in the great hymn of Vasishtha celebrating the victory of Sudas.\\(^2\\) They are the Turvasu, Matsya, Bh\u1e5bigu, Druhyu, Vaikar\u1e47a, Anu, Puru, Ajas, and Chigru. The Turvasu, Matsya, and Bh\u1e5bigu were, as will be shown further on, tribes living on the banks of the Indus south of the Purush\u1e47\u012b, or in the hilly country of Western Rajputana. The tribes north of the Purush\u1e47\u012b were the Vaikar\u1e47a, Anu, Puru, Ajas, and perhaps the Chigru, and also the Druhyu; if the Druhyu were, as I believe they were, the Kambhojas, the Matsya and Bh\u1e5bigu formed the Bh\u0101rata section of the confederacy; the Vaikar\u1e47a, Anu, Puru, and Aja the Kuru section; while the Druhyu and the Turvasu, whose capital was afterwards if not then Multan, lived near the Indus and Purush\u1e47\u012b, and formed the connecting link between the two wings.\n\nOpposed to these were the Trtsu, Paktha, Alinas, Bhal\u0101nas, Vish\u0101nin, and \u015aiva. I have already identified the Paktha with the Prthu and Panch\u0101la, and I cannot find any clue as to who the Alinas and Bhal\u0101nas were. If they are merely clan names, it will probably be impossible to trace them, and the only chance of success is in careful local inquiry in the country near the Sarasvat\u012b. As to the Vish\u0101nin and \u015aiva, I do not think there is the same difficulty. These two names are translated by Roth,\\(^3\\) following Sayana, as epithets meaning the \"spending\" and the \"fortunate\" people; but Sayana translates all the names Paktha, Alinas, and Bhal\u0101nas as epithets; and if he is right in doing this in some cases, he must be right in all, or vice versa.\n\nThe Vish\u0101nin must, I would urge, be the Yadava Vrishnis\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Rigv. vii. 33. 1 to 6.\n\\(^2\\) Rigv. vii. 18.\n\\(^3\\) Roth, Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Veda, p. 95.\nin the form of the sons of Vishnu. The eighteen tribes of the Vrishnis or Y\u0101davas in the days of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata lived in the country round Mathura,\\(^1\\) and were known to the authors of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and to Arrian\\(^2\\) as the Surasena. This country has always been noted as the headquarters of Vishnu worship, and as Vishnu was a god well known to Vedie writers, there is every probability that his worshippers would be known by a separate name among the early Aryan tribes, especially as they were certainly only half Aryans. It is they who are also called Par\u1e63u, as I have before noticed, and they were especially sun-worshippers; hence their name Surasena, the army of the sun. Vishnu, if they were called by his name, must have been their special god, just as Indra was the god of the warrior tribes.\n\nThis people, who lived in such near neighbourhood to the Panch\u0101las of the Gangetic Doab, the Trtsus on the Sarasvat\u012b, and the Matsyas, must have been engaged on one side or the other in this great war. The balance of evidence is in favour of their being on the side of the Trtsus, as the names Vish\u0101nin and Par\u1e63u both seem to refer to the Y\u0101davas or Surasena, and there is no sign of them in the list of tribes on the other side. As sun-worshippers and semi-Aryans they would be more likely to take the part of the Trtsus than that of their enemies, while on purely political grounds they would probably rather act in combination with the Paneh\u0101las and Trtsus than against them. If the Paneh\u0101las and Trtsus were crushed by the northern and western tribes, they would be sure to suffer a similar fate at their hands. It therefore seems to me that under the names Paktha and Vish\u0101nin, and the collective name Prthu-Par\u1e63u the Paneh\u0101las and Y\u0101davas must be represented as the principal allies of the Trtsus.\n\nAs for the \u015aiva, there can be no doubt that they were what Zimmer shows them to have been, the \u03a3\u03b9\u03b2\u03b1\u1fd6 or \u03a3\u03b9\u03b2\u03bf\u1fd6 of Strabo, Arrian, and Diodorus.\\(^3\\) They were also the same\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Sabha (Rajasuyambha) Parva, xiv. pp. 46 and 47.\n\\(^2\\) Arrian Indika, chap. xvii.\n\\(^3\\) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 431.\npeople whose eponymous ancestor \u015aiva, the son of U\u1e63\u012bnara, is so frequently mentioned in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. The tribe of the U\u1e63\u012bnara is spoken of in the Rigveda,\u00b9 and they are said in the Aitareya-Br\u0101hma\u1e47a to live in the middle country with the Kuru-Panch\u0101la. They are, as I will show afterwards, included among the principal tribes of the east country in the legend of G\u0101lava in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, which gives the mythical story of the origin of these tribes.\u00b2 The name U\u1e63\u012bnara may perhaps be connected with Ushas, the dawn; and if so, it will give a further proof of their eastern origin. U\u1e63\u012bnara is called in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata king of the Bhojas, a generic name of the race of cattle herdsmen, and these people were therefore the cattle herdsmen of the north-eastern countries of India. In the time of Alexander the Great\u2019s invasion, a section of the widespread tribe of \u015aiva-Bhojas had apparently settled themselves on the Jhilum, for it is there, close to Multan, that they are placed by Strabo.\u00b3 We also find them in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata among the vassals of the king of Sindhu-Suvar\u1e47a, at the time of the rape of Draupadi, which shows that a section of the tribe must also have lived on the eastern bank of the Indus near its mouth.\n\nBefore identifying the clan of the \u015aiva-Bhoja tribe, to which the allies of Trtsus belonged, it is necessary to consider the military situation carefully. A hymn of the third Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala of the Rigveda, attributed to the Bh\u0101rata bards, known under the common name of Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra, has always been considered, and I think rightly, to give an account of the plan of campaign of the Bh\u0101ratas and their allies.\u2074 In it the bard addresses the Vipa\u1e63 and Sutudri (the Bias and Sutlej), and prays them to give an easy passage to the Bh\u0101rata forces. From this it appears that the army of the Bh\u0101rata confederacy was encamped on the Purush\u1e47i, the southern boundary of the Kuru-Takka dominions, that they intended to march southward across the Bias and Sutlej, and attack the Trtsus and Panch\u0101las on\n\n\u00b9 Rigv x. 59. 10; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 130.\n\u00b2 Udyoga (Bhagavatyana) Parva, cxvii. p. 344.\n\u00b3 Strabo, xv. 8.\n\u2074 Rigv. iii. 33.\nthe upper waters of the Sarasvat\u012b beyond the Sutlej. This attack made by a route which would require them to cross both rivers would lead them directly through the Julundhar Doab country, belonging to the Tugra or Trigarta, who were, as we have seen, a tribe of cattle-herdsmen. In order to do this peacefully it was necessary to ally themselves with the Tugra. But in forming this alliance they were anticipated by the \u1e6c\u1e5btsu, who gained over the Tugra, called here by their generic name of \u015aiva, and secured for themselves the unopposed passage of the Sutlej and Bias. It was therefore the Sivas or Eastern Bhojas of Panch\u0101la, who were the allies of the \u0100ryans; while the Druhyu or Western Bhojas on the Indus, known later as K\u0101mbhojas, were on the Kuru Bh\u0101rata side. While the Bh\u0101rata and their allies were deliberating on the Northern side of the Purush\u1e47\u012b, the tribes they proposed to conquer wisely determined to take the initiative. As Indra according to the bard made the fords across the Sutlej and Bias easy for him and his army, Sudas apparently surprised his enemies by unexpectedly placing his forces in battle array on the southern bank of the river on which the northern confederacy was encamped. The description of the battle given in Vasishtha\u2019s hymn makes its incidents perfectly clear. The Bh\u0101rata and their allies were evidently flurried and confused at the sudden appearance of the people they thought were awaiting their attack in their own country. They at once determined to punish them for their insolence, and the Turvasu, under Yaksha, their leader, plunged into the Purush\u1e47\u012b, thinking, \u201cfools as they were, to cross it as easily as on dry land; but the lord of the earth (Prthivi)\n\n1 Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, p. 137.\n2 Rigv. vii. 18. 5.\n3 Rigv. vii. 18. 6. Roth, Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Veda, p. 95\n4 Roth, following the Sanskrit commentators, makes Prthivi to be the female god of the space between the heaven and earth, but translates the word as I have given it in the text. Max M\u00fcller (Lectures on the Science of Language, second series, p. 432, ed. 1864) quotes Rigv. i. 131. 1, where both the Great Prthivi and Dyu are said to have bowed before Indra. Zimmer (Altindisches Leben, p. 134) shows that in the Atharvaveda, the origin of agriculture is ascribed to Prthu, and that in the \u015aatapatha and Taittareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47as he is called the first king of the earth. It appears to me that the god of the powerful\nseized them in his might. Herds and herdsmen were destroyed.\" This description shows that the attack was made suddenly and unadvisedly. The attacking forces entered the river without carefully ascertaining where the ford was, the stream was stronger than they thought, and many were swept away by its force. The next three verses show that the attacking party could not, according to Sayana's interpretation, bring their horses and chariots into action owing to the violence of the current, and those who succeeded in crossing reached the other side in confusion \"like cattle without a herdsman.\" Sudas took advantage of this, completely routed them, and slew great numbers. He did not delay to follow up his success, but crossed the river, stormed the strongholds of the enemy, \"took their seven cities, divided the goods of the Anu among the Trtsus, and conquered the Purus,\" and made the Turvasus, Ajas, and Chigrus pay tribute.\"\n\nThe result of this war gives even a higher proof of the political genius of the Aryan leaders than that afforded by the conduct of the campaign. Instead of attempting to complete the destruction of their enemies, they allied themselves with the Kuru king Samvarana, who also showed political sagacity in accepting the alliance offered. He, as stated in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, joined the Aryans, made Vasishtha his spiritual guide, and married Tapat\u012b, the daughter of the Surasena (Vivasvat, the Sun). Their son was Kuru. After Kuru's birth the names Puru and Paurava disappear, and the people are always called Kauravya in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. This alliance continued unbroken for a very long period, to the mutual advantage of both parties. The Aryans became the chief advisers of the Kuru kings, the leaders of their armies, and the real though not the ostensible rulers of their country. The Aryan settle-\n\ntribe of the Prthus is the original meaning of the expression and not the metaphysical interpretations of Brahmin commentators. I shall show that the Panchara country of the P\u0101rthas was the principal centre of Siva-worship, and we know its northern province was called Ahik\u1e63\u1e6dra (the field of snakes), and therefore the lord of the earth would be a right translation of an expression which meant the god of the earth-worshippers. The expression is exactly similar to those so frequently found in the Bible.\n\n1 Rigv. vii. 18. 13.\n2 Rigv. vii. 18. 19.\nments on the Sarasvat\u012b became incorporated in the Kuru-\nkshetra before alluded to, and the province remained as the\neastern boundary of the Kauravya territory till the united\nAryans and Kurus conquered Ahikshetra and advanced to the\nGanges. This advance probably took place during the reign\nof \u015aantana, who is said to have married the Gung\u0101,\u00b9 meaning\nthat he was the first Kuru king who extended their rule to\nthe Ganges. He is probably a real person, as his name is\nfound in the Rigveda,\u00b2 where he is spoken of as a king,\nwhile Dhritar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du, the reputed fathers of the\nKauravas and P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, are certainly mythical. From this\nperiod the Gangetic Doab, which before belonged entirely\nto the Panch\u0101las, became known as the country of the Kuru-\nPanch\u0101las. But though the rule of the Kauravya kings\nbefore the conquest of Ahikshetra ended on the Western\nbank of the Northern Jumna, yet large numbers of the great\nKauravya people had probably emigrated southwards and east-\nwards long before. It was their emigration which probably\nprepared the way for the Kuru conquest of Northern Pan-\nch\u0101la. On their first advent to the Panch\u0101la country, they\nwere probably accepted as most desirable immigrants by the\nruling powers, who belonged, as I shall show subsequently, to\nthe race known in ancient times as the Ir\u0101vata or Haihayas,\nand who are the ancestors of the modern Gonds. They\nwould have been welcome colonists anywhere, as they are\nthe most skilful farmers of all the agricultural races of\nNorthern India, who can trace their history back to the\ndays of the Vedas and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. These people\nare still found under their original name of Kaurs in\nChattisghur in the Central Provinces and the adjoining states\nof Chota Nagpore. These districts all formed part of the great\ncountry known as Mah\u0101 Kosala,\u00b3 which was ruled up to the\ntime of the Mahratha conquest in 1741 A.D. by kings of\n\n\u00b9 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, cxl. p. 408.\n\u00b2 Rigv. x. 98. 27.\n\u00b3 Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, places the capital of Mah\u0101kosala\nat Chanda, in the District of that name in the Central Provinces, but the king-\ndom extended far to the east of Chanda to the borders of Orissa, and is coterminous\nwith the ancient Gondwana. The capitals have been successively placed at Mandla,\nChanda, and Rutunpore in the Belaspore district.\nthe Haihaya dynasty, who were originally Gonds. The earliest rulers of Northern Kosala or Ayodhya doubtless belonged to the same tribe. I can vouch from my personal knowledge of the districts for the former and present importance of the Kaurs in Chattisghar and Chota Nagpore. Kaur chiefs hold and have held for ages all the most important fiefs surrounding Rutunpore in the Belaspore District of the Central Provinces, which was the last of the capitals of the Gond Haihaya dynasty.\\(^1\\) They were formerly rulers under the Haihaibansi of the tributary state of Sirgoojya, and hold the best lands in that of Raighur in Sambulpore. These fiefs were formerly the outpost provinces of the Gond kingdom extending up to the boundary of Odhra or Orissa. Men belonging to the Ruttia clan of the Kaurs were always in great demand as frontier guards in all the states of Chota Nagpore, for they were as good soldiers as agriculturists. Their villages form the greatest contrast to those of the Gonds, Bhuyas, and other aboriginal tribes in their neighbourhood. In all Kaur townships the houses are substantial and well-built, their lands most carefully tilled, well weeded and manured, irrigated, and, where necessary, provided with well-constructed and well-designed tanks. They are a totemistic people, and lay no claim to Aryan descent, though the leading clans and chiefs, as is common among aboriginal races, call themselves Rajputs. But this is done only to assert their respectability, and they do not insist on their claim further than to call themselves Rajput Kaurs when questioned. Their customs are more allied to those of the Kolarian than the Dravidian races, as they do not follow the Dravidian custom of separating the children of both sexes from their parents as they approach maturity, and of educating them with those of the same sex which are born in the village. They are not however pure Kolarians, as there is among them a strong infusion of a much stronger, sterner, and more persevering temperament than that belonging to the improvident and excitable Koles.\n\n\\(^1\\) Kaur chiefs hold the states of Mahtin, Ooprora, Korba, and I think Kowurdha also.\nIn the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata the Kauravyas seem to be, as they are now, an unlettered people. The only Brahmins at the court of the Kauravya king Dhritar\u0101shtra, were Drona, the son of Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja, belonging to the Brahmin family of that name, and Kripa, the grandson of Gautama, the founder of another Brahmin clan called Gautama.\\(^1\\) They apparently were only skilled in military science, and were not learned in the Vedas. They only taught the young Kaurava and P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava princes the use of arms, and there is no trace of Brahminism in the accounts of their teaching, for Drona brought up Ekalavya, son of the Nishadha king, with the other young princes, and only exacted a higher fee for his services on account of the inferiority of his birth. He obliged him to allow the thumb of his right hand to be cut off, as his fee for teaching him to shoot with the bow.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe K\u0101rmis of the present day, who are in the North-west and Bengal the principal representatives of the Kauravyas, are, as far as my experience goes, opposed to Brahminism. Those in Bengal and the Central Provinces are generally followers of the unitarian creed of Kabir the weaver-prophet, who taught at Benares in the sixteenth century A.D.,\\(^3\\) and call themselves Kabirpuntis.\n\nAs for the name Kuru or Kaur, Lassen connects it with the root kar, and thinks it means the diggers, etc.,\\(^4\\) and I shall point out later on the connection of the tribe with the K\u016brma or tortoise when I discuss the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata legends dealing with the history of the snake race. Lassen\u2019s derivation is probably right, if the name is really a Sanskrit name given to these people by the Aryans; but I should look for it rather among roots occurring in the aboriginal languages than in Sanskrit. The persistence of the name among tribes who have lived so entirely separate from Sanskrit-speaking races, and who still retain own aboriginal nomenclature, seems certainly to point to an aboriginal not Sanskrit origin of the name. The Kauravyas appear, like the Takshakas,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, cxxx. and cxxxi. pp. 380-385.\n\\(^2\\) \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, cxxxiv. pp. 393-395.\n\\(^3\\) He died about 1572 A.D.\n\\(^4\\) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 103.\namong the five royal snake races mentioned in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata,\\(^1\\) and though Takshaka is derived from the Sanskrit Takshak, the original name Takka is entirely of native origin. The original name of the Kurus must apparently have been K\u016br.\n\nAs for the name Puru, it occurs constantly through the Rigveda, but in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata it is only, as I have shown, used in connection with the Kauravas up to the time of the birth of Kuru. We also find the name Paurava in several places in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata used as the name of another people. The most satisfactory passage for identifying the country where this people lived is in the very full lists of nations conquered by the Pandava princes. Among the conquests of Arjuna, Visvagaswa of the Puru race is mentioned.\\(^2\\) This king lived among the mountains, apparently near Kashmir, as the Kashmiris are the next people Arjuna conquered after the Purus. They would therefore appear to be a northern people like the Kurus. But it was the Kurus, and not the small tribe of which Viswagaswa was king, who were the northern race celebrated in history, and it is impossible to believe that the people who so materially helped the Aryans in subduing the mountain races should, in the time of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, have become an unimportant mountain tribe. The king of the Kuntibhojas is called Purujit,\\(^3\\) but the name here I believe means conqueror of cities. I would suggest that it might be possible that \u201cPuru,\u201d the tribe, and \u201cpur,\u201d the city or citadel, might have something to do with one another, and that P\u016brava might mean the people of cities or the city-builders. Certainly all the oldest cities in India, such as Hastinagur, Takkasil\u0101, S\u0101kala, S\u016brp\u0101raka, P\u0101\u1e6d\u0101la, and even Benares, were not built by Aryans. Divodasa, the great Trtsu conqueror, was a great destroyer of cities. When the Aryans entered India, they must, as I have shown in the section on trade, have found the country well provided with cities, and a great contrast to the less populous and\n\n\\(^1\\) \u0100di (Astika) Parva, lvii. p. 157.\n\\(^2\\) Sabha (Digvijaya) Parva, xxviii. p. 81.\n\\(^3\\) Sabha (Rajasuyambha) Parva, xiv. p. 45.\nmore pastoral country they had left in their early home in Eastern Ir\u0101n. It is therefore at least probable that they would have called the snake races who built the cities by a name which, to their experience, was specially distinctive, and have spoken of them as the men of the cities or the city-builders. This is by no means inconsistent with the lists of the sons of Yay\u0101ti given in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and Rigveda. This list is apparently intended to be an exhaustive division of the people of the country between the Indus and Jumna, from an Aryan point of view, for none of the names, except that of the Yadus, are those used by the people themselves. The list begins with the tribes in the south which are massed together under the names Yadu and Turva\u1e63u. These tribes, from their alliance and close connection with the Aryans, are described as half Aryan. The other three names, Druhyu, Anu, and Puru, comprise the tribes north of the Purush\u1e47\u012b, which are described as non-Aryans. It will be shown that neither the Yadus, Turva\u1e63u, Anu, or Druhyu originally belonged to the snake-worshipping races, and unless the Purus mean these races collectively, a most important section of the inhabitants, and one which must have been what the Purus are said to have been, the ruling race in the country north of the Purush\u1e47\u012b, would have been omitted. I would therefore suggest that the Purus mean the snake race generally, and more especially the Takkas, Kurus, and Northern Gandh\u0101ri, with whom the Aryans first came in contact. Whether Kutsa was a Kuru or a Gaudharva, or a representative of both tribes, who had allied himself with the Aryans, is a question which I can see no means of deciding definitely. He must, as I have shown, have been born of a race very similar to the great agricultural tribe of the Kurus.\n\nAnu.\u2014In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata the sons of Anu are stated in the passage quoted above\u00b9 to be the Mleecha tribes. In the Rigveda there seems to be a special connection between them and the Purus. In the account of the battle of the ten kings, Indra is said immediately after the battle\n\n\u00b9 Adi (Sambhava) Parva, lxxv. p. 260.\nto have given the property of the Anu to the Trtsus,\\(^1\\) which shows that they lived on the north bank of the Purushn\u012b, the river on which the battle took place, and that the Trtsus on crossing the river from the south entered at once into the land of the Anus. From another passage it seems that \u015arutarvan, son of Riksha, was their king.\\(^2\\) The bard says, \u201cWe approach the Agni most dreaded by their foes, the best, that of the Anus (\u0101nava) before which \u015arutarvan, son of Riksha, prospered greatly.\u201d I have already shown that Riksha was probably king of the Purus, or Kuru-Takkas, and this hymn, which alludes later on to the Purushn\u012b, as I have before shown, seems to prove that the Anus were the allies and subjects of the Puru king. The phrase \u201c\u0101nava agni\u201d seems to show that the Anus had forsaken their own gods and become worshippers like the Aryans of the sacred fire. This conversion could only have taken place in consequence of missionary proselytism carried on by Aryan teachers. I shall show later on the effects of the missionary efforts of the early Brahmins when speaking of the evidence of an agency of this kind among the Bh\u0101rata, \u015ar\u1e45jaya, and Kauravya tribes. There is no further evidence in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata or Rigveda to show directly to which race the Anu belonged. We find in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata that at the time when the events depicted in the poem took place, the most influential people living in the tract immediately south of the Chen\u0101b were the Madras, and the country is still called Madra-d\u0113s,\\(^3\\) and their capital, S\u0101kala, is situated on the Apaga, or \u0100yak, not far from the Chen\u0101b. Now the Madras were Takkas, according to Hemachandra,\\(^4\\) and the ruined city of Taki, called after the tribe, which Sir A. Cunningham identifies with the Pimprana of Arrian,\\(^5\\) is close to S\u0101kala. But these Takkas seem to have come into the country from the North from Takkasil\u0101 and Kashmir, and the original inhabitants of the Madra-d\u0113s seem to\n\n\\(^1\\) Rigv. vii. 18. 13.\n\\(^2\\) Rigv. viii. 74. 4.\n\\(^3\\) Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, p. 185.\n\\(^4\\) Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, p. 149.\n\\(^5\\) Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, p. 191.\nhave been Kolarians, and this would account for their being treated as of a different race from the Purus, among whom as I have shown the Takkas were reckoned. In the time of Alexander the Great the ruling people of this district were not the Takkas, whose territory was then apparently bounded by the Jhilum, though perhaps it extended to the Chen\u0101b. South of this latter river the people named as the ruling races were the Kathai and Oxydraci, who were the allies of the Malli of Multan, whom I shall show to be probably Kolarians. It is this people who are probably called Anu in the Rigveda and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, and who are still known in that part of the country by the name of Kathi. Their name also occurs in that of the province called K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r\u012b, which was probably originally peopled by Kathi. In the days of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, though the Madra-Takkas were the ruling power in the country of the Kathi, the great mass of the people probably belonged to the same race which we find living in the country when Alexander came there. The population apparently in this part of the country was always mixed, and the Kolarian and Dravidian elements were less influenced by Aryan customs and modes of thought than they were elsewhere. In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata the people living between the Chen\u0101b and Purushn\u012b are called by various names, Madras, Valhikas, Bahikas, Arattas, and it is under this last name that they are designated as an impure tribe by Baudhayana.\n\nYadu Turva\u1e63u.\u2014These two tribes are in the Rigveda constantly associated together, and are treated in a large number of passages in which the two tribes are mentioned almost as one tribe. In the genealogy in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata which makes them the sons of Yay\u0101ti, they are also united, as Devayani, the grand-daughter of Bhrgu, is the mother of them both. But Yadu appears in another genealogy in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata which makes him son of Vasu, king of Chedi, and the brother united with Yadu in this gene-\n\n1 Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, p. 216.\n2 Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, p. 215.\n3 Baudh\u0101yana, i. 1. 14.\n4 \u0100di (S\u0101mbhava) Parva, lxiii. p. 173.\nalogy is not Turvasu, but Mavellya. Vasu it is said was lord of the earth, and was made by Indra equal to the immortals. He received from Indra a crystal car, which would transport him everywhere through mid-air. In gratitude for these gifts Vasu associated the worship of Indra with that of himself. He had Indra\u2019s garlands of the unfading lotus hung on the bamboo pole or lingam, the emblem worshipped as the god Vasava. This is clearly an account of the incorporation of the worship of Indra, the Aryan warrior-god, with that of the god Vasava, whose emblem was the lingam. Throughout the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata we find that one of the names by which the black demi-god Krishna is most constantly known is V\u0101sudeva, and the use of the long \u0101 is explained by treating the word as a patronymic form, and making him the son of Vasudeva and Devak\u012b.\u00b9 His father is said to be the son of Sura the sun, or the sun-prince,\u00b2 who is, strange to say, said to be the grandson of \u0100riaka, the snake-king.\u00b3 Now there is no further account anywhere given of this Vasudeva, who only appears as Krishna\u2019s father, and nothing is told of him or his doings, as is done in the case of other prominent people mentioned in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. We hear a great deal of his sister P\u1e5bth\u0101 or Kunti, but nothing whatsoever of her brother except his name. If Krishna, the black sun-god, had been called the son of Sura, the sun, all would have been clear; but why was it necessary to bring in a second person between him and his natural mythological progenitor? Now the name Vasudeva means one who worships Vasu, whereas the name V\u0101sudeva means either the son of a worshipper of Vasu, a worshipper of V\u0101su, or it may be the title of a god V\u0101su called the Deva. In other words, Vasudeva means one who worships the Vasu or heavenly beings, the collective name for the Aryan gods; but V\u0101sudeva either means the worshipper of Vasu, a very different deity, or is a name of the god V\u0101su. It is absurd to say that an epithet showing that he\n\n\u00b9 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, lxvii. p. 178.\n\u00b2 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, cxi. p. 201.\n\u00b3 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, exxviii. p. 377.\nworshipped the Aryan gods should become such a prominent name of Krishna's father that the son should be called after it; but when we consider the other possible meanings of the word, the true explanation becomes clear. The Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata shows that there were five powerful snake races in India.\u00b9 The worshippers of each of the snake gods who were the progenitors of the several races were, according to totemistic custom, considered to be the descendants of the gods they worshipped. These races were according to this list descended from (1) V\u0101suki, (2) Takshaka, (3) Ir\u0101vata, (4) Kauravya, (5) Dhritar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. When V\u0101suki, the first of these gods, was spoken of, he would be naturally called V\u0101su or V\u0101sukideva. That this name V\u0101sudeva was applied to Krishna in common parlance is shown by its occurrence as a name of Krishna in early Buddhist writings.\u00b2 There is further evidence in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata itself that Krishna was called not only V\u0101su, but also V\u0101suki.\u00b3 Yudishthira says that Arjuna, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava hero, married the sister of V\u0101suki. Now we know that Arjuna married Subhadra, sister of Krishna,\u2074 and therefore V\u0101suki must mean Krishna, and Krishna and the snake-god V\u0101suki must be one and the same deity. That is to say, the snake-god V\u0101suki was transformed into the black sun-god Krishna.\n\nThe whole of the section in which this passage occurs must be one of the oldest parts of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, as in it further on Yudishthira speaks of regarding Arjuna as a tenth Rudra, a thirteenth Aditya, and ninth Vasu. Now in the lists of gods given in another part of the poem\u2075 thirty-three gods are mentioned, and among them eight Vasus, twelve Adityas, and eleven Rudras, sons of Sth\u0101nu, whereas in the passage in the Vi\u015b\u0101la Parva there are only nine true Rudras spoken of. The reason of this addition of two Rudras I will show further on when I come to speak of the Bh\u0101ratas and Nahushas.\n\n\u00b9 \u0100di (Astika) Parva, lvii. p. 157.\n\u00b2 Abhidh\u0101nappadipik\u0101, 16, quoted by Childers, s.v.

Vana (Aranyaka) Parva, iii. p. 14.\nIt is therefore clear that Krishna and V\u0101suki or V\u0101su were originally one and the same, but to the Sanskrit Pundits who revised the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, it was sacrilege to call the popular deity and demigod by the name of one of the snake-gods, nor could the snake-god be made to descend from the sun. Hence they gave him a father Vasudeva, and, forgetting the passage which makes the Vasudeva's sister to be descended from the snake-god \u0100riaka, they called this father a worshipper of Vasu or the Aryan gods. Similarly, in the legend relating to Vasu, king of Chedi, the long \u0101 in the name V\u0101su, father of Yadu, has been elided, and the name changed into Vasu. This V\u0101su had, like Yay\u0101ti, five sons. The mother of these sons is not stated, but the mention in another place of Devak\u012b as the mother of V\u0101sudeva or Krishna, points like the legend of Yay\u0101ti to an alliance between the worshippers of V\u0101su and the worshippers of Deva or the angels,\u00b9 who belonged, as Devayani did, to the tribe of Bhrigus. To what race the Bhrigus belonged I shall show further on. The names of Vasu's five sons were Vrihadratha, the ancestor of the kings of Magadha, Pratyagra, Kusamva (the ancestor of the kings of Kosambi), and lastly Mavellya and Yadu, who are the counterparts of Yadu and Turvasu of the Yay\u0101ti genealogy. In the account of the sons of Yay\u0101ti in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata the descendants of Yadu were, as I have before shown, said to have become Y\u0101davas, and those of Turvasu Yavanas; but before going into the questions arising out of the use of these names, and the history of these tribes, it is better first to consider their position in the Rigveda.\n\nThe Yadu-Turvasu are continually mentioned together, and in the eighth Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala of the Rigveda they appear as the special patrons of the Kanva family of Brahmin bards,\u00b2 who were the reputed authors of this section of the hymns. The two tribes are specially mentioned in connection with the defeat of the Aryan Ar\u1e47a and Chitraratha,\u00b3 and with the\n\n\u00b9 In the Buddhist cosmogony a special heaven is assigned to the Devas or Angels.\n\u00b2 Rigv. viii. 4. 1 and 7; viii. 7. 18.\n\u00b3 Rigv. iv. 30. 17 and 18.\nprevious successes of Divodasa, the Trtsu king, in his campaigns against them, which have been already alluded to.\\(^1\\) The successes of Divodasa probably represent the conquest of the country on the upper waters of the Sarasvati by the Aryan Trtsus, who drove back the Yadu-Turvasu to the west and south, and this makes it quite clear that the Yadu and Turvasu were settled in the district to the south of the Sutlej long before the Trtsus came there. We find at the present day a powerful tribe of Yohiha, or as they are called on their coins Yaudheya Rajputs,\\(^2\\) living in the country traversed by the Sutlej, between Ayudhan and Uehh, and these same tribes are mentioned in the list of Kshatrya tribes given in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata as coming to pay tribute to Yudishthira.\\(^3\\) It is they who are most likely the descendants of the ancient Y\u0101davas. The contest between their forefathers and the Ar\u1e47a and Chitraratha arose most probably from the attempt of these tribes to gain additional territory to that acquired by Divodasa. The hymn in which the battle with the Ar\u1e47a and Chitraratha is mentioned speaks of Divodasa\u2019s conquests as past, and is evidently written long after his time, while the defeat of the Ar\u1e47a and Chitraratha is apparently spoken of by the author as a recent event.\n\nBut the country held by the Turvasu and their allies was not in Vedic times confined to that near the Sutlej and Indus; for we find in the Rigveda the Turvasu united with the Vri\u015bivats, who are said to form the confederacy of the Var\u0101\u1e63ikha, and defeated by the \u015ar\u1e45jaya under Abhyavartin \u015aayamana of the Pr\u0325thu race, on the banks of the Harirupiya and Javjavat or Yavyavat.\\(^4\\) These rivers have not been identified, but I have already pointed out that the \u015ar\u1e45jaya are throughout the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata spoken of as one with the Panch\u0101las, who held the country between the Jumna and Ganges. The Turvasu and their allies must therefore at the time of this battle have been living near the Jumna. As for the Vri\u015bi-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Rigv. ix 61. 1; vii. 19, 8.\n\\(^2\\) Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, p. 245.\n\\(^3\\) Sabha (Dyuta) Parva, lii. p. 145.\n\\(^4\\) Rigv. vi. 27. 5-8.\nvats, translated by Zimmer as \"the strong energetic people,\" they were it appears to me the Y\u0101davas, whom we find living in the Surasena country, and who, as I have already pointed out, are called Vrishnis and divided into eighteen tribes. It thus seems probable that the country occupied by the Yadu-Turvasus in Vedic times was much the same as the modern Rajputana with the Mathura district added to it.\n\nThat there was an early connection between these people and the Chedi is shown in the Rigveda, as well as in the genealogy I have quoted from the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. In a hymn which is in the body of the poem, said to be an address from the Kanvas to the Asvins, Kasu, prince of Chedi, is praised for his liberality. Chedi was the country of Bundelkund, and the Kanvas were the special bards of the Yadu-Turvasu, and the fact that Kanva bards were also attached to the courts of the Chedi princes, shows that these tribes must have lived near together, and that the Yadu-Turvasu country must have been the district I have pointed out which adjoins Bundelkund.\n\nThe Y\u0101davas appear to be originally cattle herdsmen, as I shall show when speaking of the Bhojas, and they probably came from the West, but they were also intimately connected with the Kolarian and more remotely with the Dravidian races, with whom they are joined in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata genealogies. The evidence as to their descent will be shown more clearly in speaking of the Turvasus, or, as they were otherwise called, the Yavanas, and of the Bhojas. The name Yavana has been usually interpreted to mean Greeks, and it is quite indisputable that the Graeco-Bactrian kings and the Greek successors of Alexander the Great in Syria were called Yavanas, as Antiochus king of the Yavanas, and Ptolemy king of Egypt, are mentioned together in the Girnar inscription. Now the term Yavana, as applied to the Greeks, is a Semitic word denoting the sons of the Greek \u1f38\u03c9\u03bd, the Hebrew Yavan, and it was given to the Greeks by Indian writers and speakers, because they heard it applied to that\n\n1 Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 124.\n2 Rigv. viii. 5. 37.\npeople by the Phoenician sailors who frequented the Indian ports. The constant intercourse between the older Indian people and the Phoenicians, or rather the Accad-Semites of the Euphrates, must not be forgotten in considering the facts of early Indian history. It is to the Semite-Accads that the importation into India of astronomical knowledge and the art of writing is due, and the Greeks had nothing to do with this. Professor Weber says that \"the whole character of Indian astrology (it can hardly be called astronomy) was purely Chaldaic before its contact with the Greeks. We can hardly believe that the Aryans in their wanderings towards India were the first to invent the twenty-seven or twenty-eight Lunar Mansions, as we find notices of them in the older portions of the Riksamhita.\" In a quotation from the same author's History of Indian Literature, p. 30, he says: \"They are enumerated singly in the Taittir\u012bya-Samhit\u0101, and the order in which they occur is one which must necessarily have been established somewhere between 1472 and 536 B.C.\"\n\nWeber goes on to say: \"It is difficult to conceive that the Babylonians and Indians could have developed the same peculiar classification if they had been entirely independent of each other. The only possible conclusion is that one race taught the other, and to this naturally the Babylonians alone can lay claim, as we already meet with mention of the Lunar Mansions (\u092e\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0939) in II. Kings xxiii. 5, where Indian influence cannot be apprehended.\" As for the alphabet called by P\u0101nini Yavan\u0101ni, or the writing of the Yavana, it must mean the writing of the Phoenicians, for it is from them, and not from the Greeks, that the early Indian alphabets are derived.\n\nSo much for this digression, which has been inserted to prove that it was the Phoenicians, and not the Greeks, who gave the early Hindoos a large part of the knowledge they got from the outside world, and that if the word Yavana was a foreign word, it must have come through the Phoenicians or Chald\u00e6ans. But I would further submit that it is im-\n\n---\n\n1 India and the West in Old Days, p. 5.\npossible that the word can be a Ph\u0153nician or foreign word, except as applied by the Ph\u0153nician sailors to the people living at the Indian ports, and in that case it would be used by them as a general name for \"strangers.\" Whether this is possible or not, Semitic scholars can alone decide. Whatever the origin of the name may be, and however it came into the Sanskrit vocabulary, one thing is certain, that the people called Yavanas in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata are not Greeks at all, but a purely Indian tribe; though the name Yavanas is not their own tribal name, and was apparently given them by people who regarded them as aliens and inferiors. In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata three Yavana kings are mentioned. One, Chanur, is only once named as appearing at the house-warming of Yudishthira when the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas settled at Indraprastha.\u00b9 Another king of the Yavanas is named in what is apparently the earliest account of the conquests of Arjuna\u00b2 and the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. He is mentioned with the king of the Sauv\u012bra, Vipula being the king of the Sauv\u012bra, while the second king is called Sumitra and also Datt\u0101mitra. He is said to be also king of the Sauv\u012bra, but is apparently king of the Yavanas also, who are spoken of just before as conquered with the Sauv\u012bra. The name Datt\u0101mitra Lassen thinks is Greek, as it has no equivalent in Sanskrit; but this conjecture seems to me to be most hazardous. How could a king with a Greek name have ruled the Sauv\u012bra at the early times when this passage was composed? Or how could the town of Datt\u0101mitri spoken of by the scholiast of P\u0101\u1e47ini as a Sauv\u012bra town, have been named from a Greek king.\n\nBut the great king of the Yavanas is Bhagadatta, who was the great Asura Vashkala.\u00b3 He constantly appears throughout the poem. His capital was Pr\u0101gjyotisha on the sea-shore, or rather near the mouth of the Nerbudda, near Dw\u0101raka. He is described by Krishna\u2074 as the king \"who bears on his head the gem which is known as the most\n\n\u00b9 Sabha (Kriya) Parva, iv. p. 9.\n\u00b2 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, cxli. p. 15.\n\u00b3 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, lxvii. p. 194.\n\u2074 Sabha (Rajasuyambha) Parva, xiv. p. 45.\nwonderful on earth, that king of the Yavanas who has chastised Muru and Naraka, whose power is unlimited, and who rules the West like another Varuna, and who is called Bhagadatta.\" His country lay between that of the Salvas, the Eastern branch of the Sauv\u012bra, and that of Vidarbha, and probably included the lower part of the Nerbudda valley, and at least a large part of the Mallar\u0101\u015b\u1e6dra, or Avanti country. In the second and apparently later account of Arjuna's conquests\\(^1\\) he is said to have conquered Bhagadatta's troops, which are said to be composed of Kir\u0101tas, Chins, and other warriors. When Bhagadatta came to pay tribute to Yudishthira,\\(^2\\) he brought with him swords with handles made of the purest ivory and well-adorned with diamonds, which must have been got from the diamond mines of Panna, in Bundelkund. He is there called the king of the Mlecchas, and is said to have been accompanied by a large number of Yavanas. In the enumeration of the Kauravya forces assembled for the last great battle\\(^3\\) he is said to have brought a large force of Chins and Kir\u0101tas, but the Yavanas do not appear among his troops. They and the Sakas belong to the contingent of Sudakshina, king of Kambhoja, whose territory lay on the banks of the Indus, and in the account of the house-warming of Yudishthira, \"Karnatha, king of Kambhoja, and the mighty Kampana, who alone made the Yavanas to tremble at his name,\"\\(^4\\) are mentioned together. In the account of the conquests of Nakula the Yavanas, Kir\u0101tas, Pahlavas, and Sakas are named as wild tribes of the West near the Indus, whom he conquered.\\(^5\\) In the fifth rock-edict of Asoka, Yona-Kamboja-Gandh\u0101ra are placed together as his neighbours. Professor B\u00fchler,\\(^6\\) thinking they are mentioned in the order of greatest distance, takes the Yona as the most Northern tribe, and identifies them with the Bactrian Greeks. It seems to me that the evidence points\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Sabha (Digvijaya) Parva, xxvi. p. 79.\n\n\\(^2\\) Sabha (Dyuta) Parva, ii. p. 142.\n\n\\(^3\\) Udvoga (Samyodyoga) Parva, p. 43.\n\n\\(^4\\) Sabha (Kriya) Parva, p. 9.\n\n\\(^5\\) Sabha (Digvijaya) Parva, xxxii. p. 94.\n\n\\(^6\\) Laws of Manu, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xxv. B\u00fchler's translation, p. cxiv.\nto a reverse order, and that it begins from the South. I have already cited the evidence of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata as to the Yavanas living near the Gulf of Kambay and on the Lower Indus; and to the proof thus given that the Yavanas lived close to the Sauv\u012bra is to be added the account in the Asoka Avad\u0101na, of the battle which Pushpanitra, the first king of the Brahmin dynasty of the Kanvas, who rebelled against the Mauryan kings about 178 B.C., fought on the right bank of the Indus against the Yavanas.\u00b9 In the Milinda Prasna\u00b2 the nobles of king Milinda are said to belong to the Yona country, and his capital was S\u0101kala, the town I have already spoken of as the capital of the Madras in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. We thus find distinct evidence that the Yonas or Yavanas were a tribe who were settled in the districts along the Indus south of the Chen\u0101b, and that they also lived in the country on the eastern shores of the Gulf of Kambay. I have shown that the Kath\u0101ei and Oxydraei who were found at the time of Alexander the Great\u2019s invasion to be the ruling tribes in the Madra-d\u0113s, which was called the Yona country, were intimate allies of the Malli. The capital of the Malli was Multan, which is still called Mallith\u0101na or Mallisth\u0101na, the place of the Malli.\u00b3 They were an eminently warlike people, as is shown by the resistance made by them, and by their allies the Kath\u0101ei, who were of the same race, to Alexander\u2019s army. They only submitted after a defeat in the field, and after two of their cities had been taken. The power of the Malli extended to the south, as in the list of countries given in the Bh\u012bshma Parva\u2074 in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Mallar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dhra is mentioned in the same verse with the Adhir\u0101jas, whose country is, in the account of Sahadeva\u2019s conquests, placed next to that of the Matsya and Surasena.\u2075 The Southern Malli are in the list of the conquests of Bh\u012bma placed\n\n\u00b9 India and the West in Old Days, p. 18.\n\u00b2 Hardy, Manual of Buddhism, p. 536.\n\u00b3 Barnes\u2019 Travels in Bokhara, vol. iii. p. 114; Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, p. 237.\n\u2074 Bh\u012bshma Parva, v. 352.\n\u2075 Sabha (Digvijaya) Parva, xxxi. p. 87.\nnext to the Nishadas, in whose country the Sarasvat\u012b disappears at the celebrated shrine of Vi\u1e47\u0101sana. The Northern Malli are placed near the Northern Kosalas in Ayodhya, and the celebrated river Malini, in this country, on the banks of which the infant \u015aakuntal\u0101 was found, merely means the river of the Malli. In the account of the boundaries of the Kuru kingdom given in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, the Malli are placed close to the Salva, which would bring them near the Western coast. The name doubtless still survives in that of the M\u0101lavi of Malwa, and the Malli mentioned in the early Buddhist writings as one of the Vajjian tribes living on the banks of the Ganduk, near the boundary of Northern Kosala, doubtless belong to the same race. The Mahrs of the Mahratha country say that they formerly owned it, and the name Mallar\u0101shtra of the Ujjen country of Avanti makes it probable that the former name of the more Southern Mahratha country was also Mallar\u0101shtra which has been afterwards altered by bards desirous of exalting the glory of their patrons into Mah\u0101r\u0101shtra, the great kingdom. The root \u201cMun\u201d or \u201cMal\u201d appears again in the names Munda and Mandaloi applied to the Kolarian tribes of Chota Nagpore, in the Marwars of Rajputana, and the Mavellya, who are mentioned in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata as brother of Yadu, the son of V\u0101su, and the counterpart of Turvasu in the Yay\u0101ti line of descent. In short, the names Malli, Mavellya, and others formed from the same root \u201cMun\u201d or \u201cMal\u201d are general names applied to the Kolarian tribes, and the root is one belonging to the Kolarian languages, for Munda, which apparently contains it, is certainly a Kolarian word.\n\n1 Sabha (Digvijaya) Parva, xxx. p. 86\n2 Vana (Tirthayatra) Parva, cxxx. p. 392.\n3 Sabha (Digvijaya) Parva, xxx. p. 85.\n4 \u0100di (Samohava) Parva, lxxii. p. 215.\n5 Vir\u0101\u1e6da (Pandava Pravesa) Parva, i. p. 2.\n6 Original Inhabitants of Bharatavarsha, by Prof. G. Oppert, chap. iii. published in Madras Journal of Literature and Science, 1888.\n7 The root of the name was probably Mon. The Talaings, or Mons, of Pegu, call themselves Mon, and they are of the same race as the Indian Mundas. Mason (Mason\u2019s Burma, pp 130-134) shows that the Mon language has a radical affinity with the Kol or Munda tongue. He says, \u201cThe first six numerals, the personal pronouns, the words for several members of the body, and many objects of nature, are unquestionably of the same origin.\u201d See the whole question fully discussed in Fytche\u2019s Burma Past and Present, vol i. pp. 324-326.\nThe above evidence shows that the people who called themselves Malli or some similar name have always existed in large numbers, and occupied a prominent position in the Rajputana country. We find the powerful tribe of this name, in the time of Alexander the Great, holding the town of Multan, and a large and populous tract of country near it. We can trace the Malli in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata down along the Indus to the country of the Salvas, the eastern branch of the Sauv\u012bra, and we find the Ujjen or Avanti country called by their name which is still perpetuated in that of Malwa. We thus find them occupying exactly the same country as the Yavanas, and the conclusion is thus irresistible that the term Yavana is merely the Sanskrit name for the people who called themselves Malli or M\u0101lavas, and that if the Turvasu were the same people as the Yavanas, they were also Malli.\n\nThey were a people who had in their religion much in common both with that of the Dravidians and the Aryans. Like the former they reverenced mountains and local deities; and like the latter they worshipped as their chief god the sun. The Mundas of the present day still regard the sun as their highest god, under the name of Sri Bonga. They thus became early converts to the Aryan sun-worship, which was a later development of the ancient fire-worship, and joined warmly with the Aryans in propagating it. The story of the founding of the temple of the sun at Multan by \u015aamba, son of Krishna, already quoted from the Bhavi\u1e63hya Pur\u0101\u1e47a, proves both the zeal of the Malli for the religion of sun-worship, but also that they were Kolarians. \u015aamba, the son of Krishna, made a pilgrimage from Dw\u0101raka to the Mitra-Vana (the sun-grove) at Multan, to be cured of his leprosy, and on his recovering he founded there a temple to Mitra the sun.\u00b9 In other words, he went to the Surna, or sacred grove of the Kolarian Mallis, at Multan, which had been dedicated to the sun-god instead of to the local deities, to whom the Kolarian Surna is usually sacred, as being a remnant of the prim\u00e6val forest.\n\n\u00b9 Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, p. 233; India and the West in Old Days, by Prof. A. Weber, p. 19.\nProof of the early alliance between the Aryans and the Kolarian tribes is also given in the story of the snake-sacrifice in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. The bird Gadura (Garu\u1e0da), who brought the snakes to India, first brought them to the Malayan country\\(^1\\) in the south, and thence to the north, where they found the population to consist of Brahmins and Nishadas or Kolarians. The bird Gadura was permitted to devour the Nishadas, but warned not to hurt the Brahmins. But one day he ate up a Brahmin and his Nishada wife by mistake, and was forced to let them both go, at the request of the Brahmins.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe Aryan Brahmins who first settled among the Kolarian-Dravidian people of the Rajputana country found the Kolarian element there much stronger than in the more completely organized Dravidian states of the north, and they found the Kolarians much more easy to deal with, and more pleasant to live among, than the sterner and more practical Dravidians. Outsiders, who were accepted as members of a fully organized Dravidian state, were obliged to submit to the national discipline, to become component parts of the organization, to obey the orders and observe the rules emanating from the central authorities. On the other hand, new comers found much greater freedom in the looser system of a Kolarian state, or of one where the Kolarians were the dominating power, and the Dravidians in a minority. As long as they did not encroach on the lands appropriated by others in \"parhas\" or provinces already settled, they might form their own \"parhas\" close to those of the Kolarians, or even occupy and plant their villages on unowned wastes in the Kolarian parhas. When once they were settled, their internal arrangements were not interfered with. They did not find the Dravidian tax-gatherer, or the collector of dues of grain, coming to their houses; nor was it necessary to set apart king's land in every village, or to give the labour required by the superintendent of this land. As long as\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The country of the hills on the Western Ghats, anciently called the Malaya Mountains.\n\n\\(^2\\) Adi (Astika) Parva, xxvii.\u2013xxix. pp. 94\u201397.\nthey did not interfere with their neighbours, they were left alone; while if they joined with them when their assistance was wanted, they were warmly welcomed as allies.\n\nIt was among such a people that the Aryans settled, and further evidence of the identity of this people with the Munda tribes is given by their national dances, spoken of in the Rigveda and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, and also by the Greek authors. In the Rigveda\\(^1\\) the beaming rays of the morning sun are said to be like the \"maidens who come trooping out on the shady village green, dressed in their brightest clothes and ranged in order for the dance, bringing with them Soma.\" This is evidently a picture of the Kolarian dances on the Akra, or village dancing place, well shaded by the ancient forest trees of the Surna; and as for the Soma, whatever may be the fermented drink which was the nectar of the gods and the heroes, it was doubtless in the ordinary village in Vedic times, as it is now, the rice beer or palm wine (toddy), or some other fermented liquor prepared from the plants of the country where rice and palms do not grow. This is among the Kolarian tribes still prepared by the women of the family. The spring dances are again alluded to in another hymn, where the first stirrings of the birth of the leaves are said to be caused by the sound of the dancing cymbals.\\(^2\\) Further proof that the elaborate system of Kolarian dances, which provides a special dance for each season of the year, was kept up among the leading tribes of the Yadu Turvasu is given in the story of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas during the time they lived in Vir\u0101\u1e6da, the capital of the Matsyas. The Matsyas will be shown afterwards to be a Kolarian tribe, and in the account of the descendants of V\u0101su they are said to be the sons of the mountain Kolahala and the river Suktinat\u012b, born by the help of V\u0101su.\\(^3\\) The P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas all visited the court of the Matsya king in disguise, and Arjuna, who had learnt dancing in India's heaven\\(^4\\) from Chitr\u0101sena the Gandharva, became dancing-master to the daughters of the king,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Rigv. i. 92. 4.\n\\(^2\\) Rigv. x. 146; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 288.\n\\(^3\\) \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, Ixiii. p. 164.\n\\(^4\\) Vana (Indralokagamana) Parva, p. 139.\nand taught them dancing in the dancing-hall of the town of Vir\u0101ta. This is evidently the village Akra, where the Kolarian maidens still continue to learn the complicated steps and figures of the several dances of the different seasonal festivals, each festival having its appropriate dance.\n\nThese dances attracted the attention of Megasthenes and the Greek authors, and we find them compared with the Satyric dances of Dionysiac festivals. They maintain that it was Dionysos himself who taught the Indians these dances, and instructed them in the use of drums and cymbals. Megasthenes and the other Greek visitors to India saw the country under a totally different aspect from that which it bears in modern times. The people had not yet been sobered by centuries of Buddhist and Brahminical rule, nor saddened by the heavy burdens of Mussulman tyranny, and by the anarchy caused by the rivalries of foreign competitors for power. They had not yet learned to be ashamed of their national amusements. Consequently these seasonal dances, which are now confined to remote and unfrequented parts of the country, were celebrated at the appropriate seasons in all towns and villages. At these festivals, as at those of the present day, there were doubtless large quantities of strong drink consumed, and they frequently, as they do now, degenerated into Bacchic orgies. Of the reverence for groves I have already given an instance in speaking of the Sun grove (Mitra Vana) at Multan, and we find also that in the account of the attack on Dvaraka by the Salva, it is said to be a rule that hostile armies should spare sacred trees.\n\nThe results of the above inquiry show strong reason for believing that the earliest inhabitants of the Yadu-Turvasu country, answering to the modern Rajputana, were Kolarian tribes; but before the Aryans entered the country, the Kolarian stock had been largely mixed with the races of the Bhojas and the Dravidian Sauvira. There were also a large number of semi-Aryan Bhojas, but the relations of these tribes will be discussed in that part of this paper in which I deal with the Bhojas.\n\n1 Arrian, Indika, chap. vii.\nSuvar\u1e47a or Sauv\u012bra.\u2014The next people to be noticed are the great trading races of the Sindhu-Sauv\u012bra. They generally lived in cities on the high roads and near the rivers, which were the natural highways of the country. They left the open country and the hills and valleys to the agricultural and pastoral people. The kingdom in which they were supreme was that of Sindhu Suvar\u1e47a, the capital of which was P\u0101t\u0101la, near the mouths of the Indus. They were the people known to the authors of the Rigveda as the \u201cpani,\u201d or traders, but are also mentioned under their own name of Suvar\u1e47a.\u00b9 They probably belonged, as I have already shown, to the great tribe of Sus, who were the traders of the Euphrates valley, and the founders of Susa. They early began to move eastward, and they first settled themselves in the Saurashtra country of Guzer\u0101t, to which they gave their name, and thence they directed the foreign trade from the ports on the Gulf of Kambay. We find their progress eastward clearly marked in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. The Bh\u0101rata king Suhotra, the grandson of Bh\u0101rata, married Suvar\u1e47\u0101, the daughter of Ikshv\u0101ku. In other words Ikshv\u0101ku, who is known in the Rigveda as the \u201crich,\u201d\u00b2 belonged to the tribe of the Suvar\u1e47a, and the story of the origin the Ikshv\u0101ku kings given in Buddhist traditions shows that they came eastward, like the Suvar\u1e47a, from P\u0101t\u0101la, where they, as Suvar\u1e47a, ruled the country called Sindhu-Suvar\u1e47a.\u00b3 King Janamejaya, to whom the story of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is supposed to be told, married a daughter of Suvar\u1e47a-Vamana, king of Kasi,\u2074 showing that the Sauv\u012bra had obtained possession of Benares. But there is also, I believe, much clearer evidence of their progress eastward than that given by these instances. The oldest capital of the Suvar\u1e47a was P\u0101t\u0101la, which is called in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata the centre of the world of N\u0101gas.\u2075 From this it seems that the tribe which founded P\u0101t\u0101la must have had offshoots in the west and east, and this is an additional proof that they were related to the Assyrian traders, the Saus or Sus of the Euphrates valley.\n\n\u00b9 Rigv. x. 62. 11.\n\u00b2 Rigv. x. 60; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 130.\n\u00b3 Rockhill\u2019s Life of Buddha, p. 11 (Tr\u00fcbner\u2019s Oriental Series).\n\u2074 \u0100di (Astika) Parva, xliiv. p. 131.\n\u2075 Udyoga (Bhagavatya\u1e47a) Parva, xcvi. pp. 304, 305, also cii. pp. 311, 312.\nIt was at P\u0101t\u0101la that V\u0101suki, the great king of the N\u0101gas, used to dwell; but in the legend, telling how M\u0101tali, Indra's charioteer, found a wife for his son, which I am now quoting, V\u0101suki is represented as the king of Bhojavati (Bhojakata), the capital of the Bhojas. But though V\u0101suki was the king, it is not he who receives M\u0101tali, but the snake-king \u0100ryaka, who was the snake-ancestor of the Bhojas. It is his grandson, whose mother was the daughter of V\u0101mana, of the line of Ir\u0101vata,\u00b9 who was chosen by Indra's messenger. This story evidently means that the Suvar\u1e47a and their ancestral god V\u0101suki had moved eastward from P\u0101t\u0101la to Bhojakata, but that their ancestral god had succumbed to the arianized Bhojas, whose ancestor \u0100ryaka possessed the authority which had been under the Suvar\u1e47a rule before Aryans became the leading race vested in V\u0101suki. I have already shown how the god V\u0101su, who was the god of the Sauv\u012bra, was represented as the first king of Chedi, the country adjoining Bhojakata or Avanti on the east. I have shown above that the Krish\u1e47as or Vrishnis worshipped a god called V\u0101su, who was the snake-god V\u0101suki, and this god was the god of the Sauv\u012bra. Further proof of this is given by the reference of Krishna to the king V\u0101sudeva of Vanga, Pandra, and the Kir\u0101tas in Bengal.\u00b2 Krishna denounces this king as \"that wicked wretch among the Chedis\" (who were, as we have seen, the Suvar\u1e47a or the sons of V\u0101su), \"who represents himself as a divine personage, who has become known as such, and who always bears from foolishness the signs which distinguish me, that king of Vanga, Pandra, and the Kir\u0101tas, who is known upon earth by the name of P\u0101ndraka and V\u0101sudeva.\" The name V\u0101sudeva, given here to a king who was certainly not the son of V\u0101sudeva, means clearly a worshipper of V\u0101su. This passage shows that V\u0101su was worshipped by one of the most influential of the races in Bengal, which is probably that which worshipped V\u0101su in the West. It therefore clearly appears that before this time the Suvar\u1e47a had advanced from Chedi to Bengal,\n\n\u00b9 See Suvarna-V\u0101mana above.\n\u00b2 Sabha (Rajasuyambha) Parva, xiv. p. 45.\ntaking possession on their march of the west side of the valley of the Ganges, and establishing themselves in Benares. They had also become the dominant people in Bengal, and had peopled the province called by Hiouen Tsiang Kar\u1e47a-Suvar\u1e47a. This province comprised the modern districts of Birbhum, Burdwan, Bancoorah, Manbh\u016bm, Singhbh\u016bm, and the north of Midnapur, and controlled all the trade routes to the great eastern port of Tamralipti (Taml\u016bk), which was situated in the district. A further remarkable proof that the Suvar\u1e47a of Bengal were the same people as the Suvar\u1e47a of P\u0101\u1e6d\u0101la and Saurashtra, is given by the sacred mountains in the two districts. Close to the boundary between the country of the Western Sauv\u012bra and that of the Yavanas, Kir\u0101tas or Malli of Western Rajputana, was the sacred mountain of Arbuda. This was Mount Ab\u016b, known as the mountain of the Arbudas or snakes, and the same as the sacred mountain of the Arbudas in the Vishnu Purana, and of the Arbudas or snake races known to the bards of the Yadu-Turvasu, belonging to the Kanva family. This was in ancient days as sacred to the Sauv\u012bra as it is to their successors and descendants the Jain traders; but it was also a holy place of the Kolarian tribes, and as it stood upon the boundary between the two races, it was a common object of reverence to both. The situation of the sacred mountain of Parisn\u0101th in Bengal is precisely similar to that of Mount Ab\u016b in the West. It is most certainly, as Col. Yule supposes it to be, the Mons Malleus of Pliny, common to the Monedes or Mundas, and the Suari or Sauv\u012bra of Western Bengal, and is probably the Mount Mandar of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. The river Burr\u0101kar, which runs below it to the east, divides the territories of the Mundas of the Dam\u016bda (D\u0101-m\u016bnda) valley from the Sauv\u012bra of Kar\u1e47a Suvar\u1e47a, and it is among the Jains only second in sanctity to Mount Ab\u016b and the other western shrines. But the identity of the Suvar\u1e47a of Bengal\n\n---\n\n1 Beal, Records of the Western World, vol. ii. p. 201.\n2 Vishnu Pur\u0101na, bk. ii. 8.\n3 Rigv. viii. 3. 19, Arbuda means a snake.\n4 Pliny, Nat. Hist. vi 22. 6.\n5 \u0100di (Astika) Parva, xviii. pp. 79-81.\nwith the people of the same name in Western India is not the only lesson we learn from the Jain sacred places. It is to the history of the propagation of Jain doctrines that we must look for further evidence of the progress of the Suvar\u1e47a and their allies from west to east. The strongest proof of the original connection of the Suvar\u1e47a with Jainism is given by the following facts: (1) That it is well known to all who have studied the subject that a very large and influential section of the trading classes of Western India are Jains, and that they are, and have always been, the staunchest supporters of the Jain religion. (2) That the most sacred, and therefore the original sites of Jain worship are situated in districts which have from the earliest times been especially under the control of the Suvar\u1e47a, from whom I believe the western Jain traders to be descended. The three principal Jain shrines, stated in the order of their sanctity, are (1) the Satrunjaya hill, overlooking the capital of the State of P\u0101lit\u0101na;\u00b9 (2) the Girn\u0101r hill, near Junagurh or Yavana-gurh,\u00b2 both of which are in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, and (3) Mount Ab\u016b.\n\nThe whole of this country lies within the ancient states of Sindhu-Suvar\u1e47a and Saurashtra, and includes the modern districts of Sindh, Kutch, K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, and Guzer\u0101t. The names K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, i.e. the country of the Kathi, and Junagurh, the fort of the Yona or Yavana, distinctly show that the two most sacred shrines were situated in a Kolarian district. I have already proved that the Yavana were the original inhabitants of the delta of the Indus, and I shall prove subsequently that Guzer\u0101t also belonged to tribes of the same stock. This country was the earliest centre of foreign trade which was conducted by the Suvar\u1e47a first from P\u0101t\u0101la, and afterwards from the ports on the Gulf of Kambay. The associates of the Suvar\u1e47a in the Government of Sindhu-Suvar\u1e47a and of K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r were, as will be shown further on, the cattle-herding tribes called Bhojas, \u015aivas, \u015aakas or Abhirias, who came, like the Suvar\u1e47a, from the country between the Indus and the Euphrates. These people\n\n\u00b9 Hunter's Gazetteer, vol. xi. p. 4, s.v. P\u0101lit\u0101na.\n\u00b2 Hunter's Gazetteer, vol. v. p. 86, s.v. Girn\u0101r.\nformed the warrior section of the Suvar\u1e47a advance, and accompanied them in their progress. But these people were also accompanied by Brahmins, or teachers of Aryan doctrines. The Jain religion, as Prof. Jacobi has shown,\\(^1\\) was an exaggerated form of asceticism based on the rules prescribed for the conduct of Brahmin students of the sacred law, and though it was in a certain sense a protest against Brahminism, and an assertion of the doctrine that Kshatryas\\(^2\\) and others could be saved as well as Brahmins, yet the movement was not without Brahmin support. All this is shown clearly in the life of Mah\u0101v\u012bra, the contemporary of the Buddha, and the last and greatest of Jain teachers. But his life also gives reason to believe that Jainism was the fashionable and orthodox creed of the great trading town of Vais\u0101li, the capital of Videha, to the north-east of the Ganges. Mah\u0101v\u012bra, who was born in a suburb of Vais\u0101li, when he became a prophet, and devoted himself to an ascetic life, did so with the full consent of his elder brother, who, after his father\u2019s death, was the head of his family, and did not do so till he had first married and had a daughter.\\(^3\\) In doing this he merely followed the rules laid down for religious Brahmins, who are enjoined to be first householders and afterwards ascetics. Considering that his father was one of the chiefs of the G\u00f1\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6dika tribe of the Licchavis, and his mother sister of Chetaka, king of Vidcha, his change of religion, if any had taken place, would have caused a stir; and as there is no mention of any change of belief, the natural conclusion is, that the Jain religion, whose tenets he carried to the full rigour of the law, was that professed by the other members of his family. We also find in the Mah\u0101vagga that S\u012bho, the general-in-chief of the Licchavis, who was afterwards converted by the Buddha, was first a lay disciple of Mah\u0101v\u012bra,\\(^4\\) for he consulted him before he sought instruction in Buddhist\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Sacred Books of the East, vol. xxii. pp. xxiii-xxx.\n\n\\(^2\\) Sacred Books of the East, vol. xxii. p. xxx.\n\n\\(^3\\) Kalpa Sutra, sect. 110; Sacred Books of the East, vol. xxii. pp. 256, 257, also preface p. xv.\n\n\\(^4\\) Mah\u0101vagga, vi. 31. 2, Rhys Davids and Oldenburg\u2019s translation, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xvii. p. 109.\ndoctrines. As we thus find that two of the most prominent families among the Licchavis of Vais\u0101li were professed Jains, the conclusion that naturally follows is that it was the religion of most, if not of all, the chief men of the city. But if the Licchavis were generally Jainists, the next question to be considered is as to how they came to be consistent professors of a religion founded by the Suvar\u1e47a of the west. Jain and Buddhist writers always speak of these people as Lecchai or Licchavi, but this name has no apparent connection with Suvar\u1e47a. When, however, we look carefully at the words Suvar\u1e47a and Sauv\u012bra, it is clear that while the first syllable may probably mean the Sus or Saus, the last two are a Sanskrit termination, which could not be part of the real name of a non-Aryan tribe. On the other hand, the name Licchavi, or Lecchai, is clearly a name used by the people themselves. The religion of the Licchavis clearly points to a connection between them and the Suvar\u1e47a, and therefore, in looking for a derivation of the name, we are entitled to consider the history of the Saus of P\u0101\u1e6d\u0101la. I have already attempted to show that these Saus must have come from the west and settled in P\u0101\u1e6d\u0101la and conducted the foreign trade of that and the neighbouring ports long before the Aryans came into India or ruled in Persia, and that therefore their tribal names would naturally be derived from the languages of the Accads and Semites, who were the earliest rulers of the Euphrates valley. In Mr. Beal\u2019s translation of the Chinese Life of the Buddha, v. 1906, I find the Licchavis called the lion Licchavis, and he justifies this translation by a reference to Sayce\u2019s Assyrian Grammar, where an Accadian root liq or lig, signifying lion, is mentioned. I find this reference in page viii of that work. If this root were adopted as the name of one or more of the Sau tribes, the name thence arising would be Likkai, which, if the guttural were softened, as it frequently is, would become Lecchai or Licchavi, the lion\n\n1 Kalpa Sutra, 128; Sacred Books of the East, p. 266, note 1.\n2 Sacred Books of the East, vol. xix. p. 278.\n3 In a note to v. 1788 of the translation of the Chinese Life of the Buddha, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xix. p. 258, Mr. Beal refers to Hardy\u2019s Manual of Buddhism, p. 282 (it is p. 291 in the 2nd edition), where the king of the\npeople. Now, we have seen above that the general-in-chief of the Licchavis was called Siho, or the lion, and the same name under the form of Singh, signifying lion, is universally adopted at the present day by families claiming Rajput or noble descent, and this honorific title would be merely a translation of the Accad Likkai. Professor Sayce describes the Assyrians or Accads as a \"race of warriors and traders rather than of students,\"\u00b9 and this description would apply accurately to the united Sau and Bhoja or \u015aaka tribes, who gained the control of the Indian trade both in the west and east. It must be remembered that at the time of the advance of these tribes eastward caste hardly existed, and though families doubtless followed the business of their forefathers, yet there was ample room for a change of occupation, and one member of a family might be a trader, and others warriors or herdsmen, if their inclinations or circumstances led them to adopt different professions without infringing social customs.\n\nThe whole of the above evidence shows, I would submit, good ground for believing that the founders of Vais\u0101li, and of the kingdom of Videha, were the trading and fighting races of Sindhu-Sauv\u012bra and Saur\u0101shtra who had originally come from the valley of the Euphrates. The Buddhist and Jain historians further show us that these people united with the Malli or Kolarian aborigines of the country of Videha to form the Vaggian confederacy of nine Licchavi and nine Mallaki tribes,\u00b2 just as they had joined with the Yavana in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r. I have also, I hope, proved that the Saus, or Sauv\u012bra, of both Western and Eastern India, were both originally worshippers of V\u0101su or V\u0101suki, and belonged to the snake race of that name; and that they are the same as the Jain traders or Saos of India.\n\nLicchavis is called Mah\u0101-li, which he thinks means the great lion, and refers to the Hebrew layish, a strong lion. This li certainly appears to be part of the root of Licchavi, and it confirms the argument I have stated as to the origin of the name Licchavi. As examples of the change of the hard guttural kh into ch, the P\u0101li words akkhi and acchi, the eye, and ikko and archo, a bear, may be cited. In Alberuni's India, Sachau's translation, chap. xix. vol. i. p. 220, I find Li-yaya given as a Hindu synonym for the sign of the Zodiac called Simha, the lion. This is a further proof that Li meant lion.\n\n\u00b9 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 122.\n\u00b2 Kalpa Sutra, 128; Sacred Books of the East, vol. xxii. p. 266.\nIt was this people who became the Vaisyas of the Sanskrit law-writers, and it appears to me to be probable that the name Vaisya was given to them from their connection with Vasu. They ought properly to have been called V\u0101syu, but the same reasons that caused the change of V\u0101sudeva into Vasudeva, also caused the alteration of the name V\u0101syu or Vasava to Vaisya. When it became a reproach to be a worshipper of Vasu, the name was changed so as to obliterate the memory of so unpleasant a recollection.\n\nNahusha.\u2014In the Rigveda, as in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, we find Nahusha named as the father of Yay\u0101ti. In several other places where the word Nahusha occurs in the Rigveda, B\u00f6htlingk-Roth translate the name as meaning neighbours, and Grassmann follows them. Ludwig, however, treats the name as that of a tribe, and in this I must say that I think he is right. Ludwig\u2019s translation is, as I hope to show, not only historically correct, but in two of the passages where the word occurs the translation of \u201cneighbours\u201d quite distorts the sense; and in all, the meaning of the poet comes out much more clearly when Nahusha is taken as denoting a tribe instead of the indefinite term neighbours.\n\nThe first passage in which it appears to me that there can be no doubt that Nahusha means a tribe is in Rigv. vii. 6. 5, in a hymn in praise of Agni. Verse 3 of this hymn tells how Agni drove out \u201cthe stolid, soft-speaking (M\u1e5bdhrav\u0101c), greedy barbarians, without belief, who give no gifts or offerings,\u201d and then goes on in verse 5 to tell of Agni, who \u201cwith his club beat down the earthen walls, conquered for the Aryans the Eastern land (Ludwig\u2019s translation), overthrew the villages of the Nahusha, and made them pay tribute.\u201d Surely, as Zimmer points out, the translation of Nahusha as the name of a tribe is in this passage more likely to be right than that of neighbours.\n\nAnother passage, for the translation of which I am indebted to Prof. Bendall, is even more significant. It is Rigv.\n\n---\n\n1 Rigv. x. 63. 1; \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, xciv. p. 282.\n2 Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 128.\nx. 49. 8. In this hymn Indra recites his deeds, and the half verse in which the word \"Nahusha\" occurs runs as follows:\n\nAham saptah\u0101.  \nnahusho nahushtara.\n\nI (am) the slayer of seven.\u00b9 more Nahusha than Nahusha himself.\n\nThat is to say, I am more powerful than Nahusha. The allusion here is evidently to the legend in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, in which Nahusha contended with Indra for supremacy in heaven by trying to seduce his wife \u015aachi, and got worsted in the contest.\u00b2 When Nahusha is in translating this passage interpreted to mean Nahusha, the father of Yay\u0101ti, it makes the very peculiar form of expression used here intelligible and striking, whereas to translate \"Nahusho nahushtara,\" as Grassmann does, \"I am nearer than the neighbours,\" is weak and almost unmeaning.\n\nThat so powerful an antagonist of the Aryan gods should have given his name to a tribe is exceedingly probable, and this probability is almost converted into a certainty by another passage in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, where it is said that it was the king of the Haih\u0101yas who contended with Indra and tried to seduce \u015aaeh\u012b his queen.\u00b3 There is no derivation given in B\u00f6htlingk-Roth for the word Haih\u0101ya, but the Haihaibunsis have always been one of the great snake-worshipping races, and their direct descent from the great snake race of Ir\u0101vata will be fully proved further on. The name Haihaya\u2074 would seem to be connected with the word ahi a snake, and the reduplication may represent the hissing noise made by snakes. Such an interpretation has, I know, been given, but I have mislaid the authority and cannot now find it.\n\nThe story of Nahusha's contest with Indra, after which he was changed into a snake, makes it nearly certain that he was the great snake or the embodied representative of the serpent races; and that this was the case is rendered\n\n\u00b9 The seven slain are the seven snake-gods, see p. 297. Also the seven sons of D\u0101nu.

See Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, pp. 134, 142; also see Appendix B.\nstill more probable by the remarkable coincidence we find between the word Nahusha and that used in Hebrew for the brazen serpent worshipped by the people of Judaea. This brazen serpent, which Hezekiah destroyed,\\(^1\\) is called \u05e0\u05b7\u05d7\u05b2\u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05b9\u05df naghash, which is precisely the same word as Nahusha, for the substitution of the soft for the hard guttural is one which constantly occurs in all philological changes. That the guttural used in India was originally hard is rendered probable from the word N\u0101ga, the sons of the Nag or Naghash, which is the patronymic derived from the same root, and which does not appear to be an original Sanskrit word.\n\nThe name Nahusha for the great serpent must, if this hypothesis be correct, be derived from some root common to the Dravidian tribes who preceded the Semites in Palestine, and the Aryans in India. It was probably in Assyria that the earth was first worshipped under the symbol of the serpent as the great generative power. The tribes who originated the doctrine were most likely the same race who ruled in the Euphrates valley before the Semites, and may have been the Accads. The transfer of the same word from the Euphrates to Palestine in the West and India in the East, is strictly analogous to the similar transfer I already noticed of the lunar mansions to both countries.\\(^2\\)\n\nThat the Haihayas were a sufficiently powerful and widespread tribe to be called the Nahusha or the great serpent race, can be proved by tracing the former extent of their dominions, which can be done with a very considerable approach to accuracy. I have already, in writing about the Kauravyas, shown that the two states named Kosala, the modern Ayodhya,\\(^3\\) and the other called Mah\u0101 Kosala, co-terminous with Gondwana, apparently originally belonged to one and the same\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) II. Kings xviii. 4.\n\n\\(^2\\) The name Asura and D\u0101nava commonly used in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata to denote the snake races may probably come from the same source, Asura from Assur, the god of the Accads (Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, pp. 122-3), and D\u0101nava from the sons of Danu (the strong), daughter of Daksha, the Accad root dan, strong (Sayce, Assyrian Grammar, p. 114).\n\n\\(^3\\) Sir A. Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, p. 408, shows that Northern Kosala is the country called Ganda (Gonda) in the Matsya, Linga and K\u016brma Pur\u0101\u1e47as as Sravasti the capital is there said to be in Gand\u0101, i.e. Gonda. This is additional evidence proving that the Gonds or Haihayas were the original rulers of both the Kosalas; \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, lxv. p. 186.\npeople. I have also shown that a considerable portion of the ancient dominions of the Haihaibunsi race was governed, up to the time of the Mahratha conquest in 1741 A.D., by kings of that dynasty, and that they were from time immemorial the rulers of M\u0101ha Kosala. It is therefore probable that they were also the rulers of Northern Kosala. If they were the Nahusha of the Rigveda, their territories were coterminous with those of the Aryans on the western bank of the Jumna, and they were the original rulers of the Kuru-Panch\u0101la country, as well as of Ayodhya, the whole of which district was formerly called Kosala. They also held Benares,\u00b9 as the daughters of the king of Kasi or Benares are called in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata princesses of Kosala,\u00b2 and in the time of Buddha we find that Prasenajit, king of Kosala, is also king of Benares. But still more cogent proof of the former extent of their dominions is given in the legends about Yay\u0101ti, son of Nahusha, who contended with the gods for supremacy, as his father had done, and who was vanquished and fell from heaven.\u00b3 There are two places of pilgrimage, both of which are said to be the spot where his fall took place, one at Naimisha,\u2074 on the Gumt\u012b in Oude, and the other on the river Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitr\u0101, which rises in the Vaid\u016brya hill, north of the Nerbudda.\u2075 The Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitr\u0101 is almost certainly the river still called by that name, on which Baroda stands, and the Vaid\u016brya hill must be that on which the famous fort of Champ\u0101nir is built, and in which the Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitr\u0101 rises. The dominions of the Haihayas must have included both Naimisha in Ayodhya, and Baroda in Guzer\u0101t, and the whole country between must have belonged to them, and we know further that they formerly ruled the Nerbudda valley, from the fact that it was there that Parasu-R\u0101ma killed\n\n\u00b9 But the district in which Benares was situated was that south of the Sarju or Ghagra, called Bundh\u0101 or the forest (bun) tract, and was, as will be shown later on, more especially the country of the Burs or Bh\u0101ratas.

I have before noticed the five eponymous ancestors of the snake races named in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, V\u0101suki, Takshaka, Ir\u0101vata, Kauravya, Dhritar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, and have shown that the V\u0101suki were the Suvar\u1e47a, the Takshaka the Takkas, and the Kauravya the Kurus. The Ir\u0101vata can, I believe, be shown to be the Haihayas or Gonds. The name Ir\u0101vata is the same word as the Pali Er\u0101patha, which appears among the four royal snake races which, as Prof. Rhys Davids has pointed out to me, are mentioned in the Buddhist Chullavagga. The name Ir\u0101vata is said by B\u00f6htlingk-Roth to apply to a people coming from the Ir\u0101vat\u012b. Ir\u0101vat\u012b is the name of the river Rapti in Oude, and also one of the names of the Purushn\u012b, now called the Ravi, which, as it is the popular name, was probably that which the river was called before it was named Purushn\u012b by the Aryan writers. The kingdom of Kosala or Ayodhya was, as we have seen, the original home of the Haihayas, and they were therefore the people called Ir\u0101vata, who were said to be descended from the Ir\u0101vata in the same way as we have seen that the Matsya were said to be descended from the Suktimat\u012b. They were therefore the people called the Nahusha in the Rigveda, and their country was the Eastern land which had been acquired by Agni for the Aryans. How the conquest of this Eastern land was effected will be explained in detail when I come to speak of the Bh\u0101ratas, and further proof will then be given connecting the Ir\u0101vat\u012b with the earliest inhabitants of Ayodhya and of the country to the east of the Jumna. Here I will only add one more proof arising from the snake legends to those which have already been given of the geographical position of the Ir\u0101vata. In the Buddhist legend of the great N\u0101ga Raja El\u0101patra, he is said to have\n\n---\n\n1 Vana (Tirtha-Yatra) Parva, cxvi. and cxvii. pp. 358 to 362.\n2 Chullavagga, v. 6. The four royal snake races are (1) Vir\u016bpakkas, (3) Er\u0101patha, (3) Chaby\u0101puttas, (4) Kanha-gotamakas.\n3 We have seen that the Purushn\u012b was the boundary of the Puru kingdom. Can the name have anything to do with Puru, and does it mean the river of the Purus? It was, when called the Ir\u0101vata, probably the northern boundary of the Ir\u0101vata race, separating them from the Kurus and Takshakas or Takkas.\n4 Rigv. vii. 6. 3.\nstretched his body from Takkasila to Benares.\\footnote{Beal, Buddhist Records of the Western World, vol. i. p. 137 note.} Now El\u0101-patra is the same word as Ir\u0101vata, and the legend merely means that the Ir\u0101vata or Haihaya ruled the country from the boundaries of the Takka kingdom on the Purushn\u012b or Western Ir\u0101vata, to those of the kingdom of Benares. They there came in contact with the Kaling\u00e6, who, under the name of Mugho-Kaling\u00e6,\\footnote{They are the Maccokaling\u00e6 of Pliny, Hist. Nat. vi. 21, whom Vivien de St.-Martin has identified with the Mugheyas of Magadha, and the Mughs of the Eastern Bengal sea-board. They are doubtless the same people who are so well known to North Behar magi-trates as the Mugbeya Domes.} ruled Magadha, and gave their name to the country.\n\nBut though the Haihaya race ruled this very extensive tract of country, it must not be supposed that there was only one sovereign over the whole. This would have been impossible under the Dravidian system of government, which requires every part of the dominions of each king to be in constant touch with the central power. As I have before shown, in the section on trade, the country, or those parts of it where the government was thoroughly organized, was probably broken up into a number of confederated states, each state having its own provinces. These provinces owed allegiance to the central ruler of the separate kingdom to which they belonged, but enjoyed considerable latitude as to local government, provided the people paid the prescribed tribute or service. There may have been a number of these states which were federally under the control of the most powerful and influential king in their immediate neighbourhood, but this union was by no means constant, and depended on the existence of some king of commanding ability.\\footnote{These were the kings known in Sanskrit literature as Chakravarta or universal Rajas. The type of the chakra or wheel, here used to represent the model or ideal kingdom, gives an admirable picture of the typical Dravidian state, in which the king lived in the centre, and the subordinate provinces or kingdoms, like the spokes of the wheel, surrounded the centre from which they derived their motion.} The division of kingdoms was probably from very ancient times much the same as we find among the lists given by the Sanskrit geographers, and there were certainly a considerable number of Kolarian states interspersed among those governed by Haihaya kings.\nDruhyu or Bhojas.\u2014Before dealing with the Bh\u0101rata, and completing the account of the earliest inhabitants of that part of India which was under Haihaya control, it will be better to take up the questions relating to the Druhyus or Bhojas. Till the origin and history of these people is understood it is quite impossible to unravel the course of events in the west and east, the retrogression of the Haihaya tribes, the advance of the Suvar\u1e47a and Ikshv\u0101ku, the gradual substitution in the west of sun worship for that of the snake gods, and the establishment of Aryan supremacy first in the west and afterwards from this starting point over the whole of Northern India.\n\nThe whole history of the Bhoja tribes is most complicated and obscure, owing to the intermixture of foreign and native elements. I shall show that there are Bhojas with strong Dravidian affinities; others allied to the Kolarians; others to the Aryans; and others to the horse-rearing and cattle-herding tribes of Central Asia and Assyria. In the genealogy which makes the Bhojas the descendants of Druhyu, son of Yay\u0101ti, their mother is said to be Shar-misht\u0101, the daughter of the Asura Vrishaparva. Therefore the Druhyus according to this account were apparently descended from the Haihaya race to which Yay\u0101ti belonged, and also from the race of which the Asura Vrishaparva was a member. This latter was seemingly that of the Madras or Takkas, as Ayaka, the brother of Vrishaparva, is said to have become known on earth as \u015aalya, king of the Madras.\u00b9 I have also spoken of another account of the origin of the eastern Bhojas which makes them the descendants of \u015aiva, the son of U\u015binara.\u00b2 In this genealogy their mother is M\u0101dhav\u012b, the daughter of Yay\u0101ti, and she will be shown further on to be probably a Kolarian. But the ancestor of the Bhojas, who appears in the Vasu genealogies (which is apparently one of the later parts of the poem), is Ku\u1e63amva, one of the sons of V\u0101su,\u00b3 and he evidently represents the\n\n\u00b9 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, lxvii. p. 194.\n\u00b2 Udyoga (Bhagavatya\u1e47a) Parva, cxvii. p. 344.\n\u00b3 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, lxiii. p. 173.\nKuntibhojas who founded Ko\u015b\u0101mbi. It was not however till long after the wars of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata that they came so far East.\n\nKo\u015b\u0101mbi was founded by Chakra, eighth in descent from Arjuna, the Pandava hero, who removed there when Hastinapur was submerged by the Ganges.\u00b9 From that time it was the capital of the Vatsas or Kuntibhojas, and it was unknown at the time of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, when the Eastern boundary of the Kuntibhoja kingdom was the Charmanvati (Chambal) river.\u00b2 One of the most important tribes of Bhojas was that ruling in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, whose capital was Dv\u0101raka, and it is with this tribe that the Vrishnis, to whom Krishna belonged, are especially connected. These Bhojas traced their descent from Valar\u0101ma, who appears from time to time as giving advice to Krishna and the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, but who is evidently a mythical person. He was the son of Rohin\u012b, and Rohin\u012b was the daughter of Surav\u012b, who again was the daughter of Krodh\u0101.\u00b3 Krodh\u0101 was the daughter of Daksha, and \u201cher countless progeny\u201d are said to be \u201cas wicked and cruel as herself.\u201d\u2074 Rohin\u012b was the mother of cows, and the above description of the origin of her ancestors makes it clear that her descendants were not considered to be an Aryan tribe. From another passage it is evident that they were thought to be of Kolarian descent. In the list of kings said to be descended from Krodh\u0101, and to belong to the Krodhvasa race,\u2075 occur the names not only of Rukmi, king of the Bhojas, whose sister, Rukmin\u012b, Krishna married, but also that of Ekalavya, who was king of the Nishadas, and who was brought up with the Kauravya and P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava princes.\u2076 The Nishadas were certainly Kolarians, and I have already drawn attention to the legend telling of the inter-marriages between the Nishadas and the Brahmins. But there is a further\n\n\u00b9 Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, pp. 391-392.\n\u00b2 Subha (Digvijaya) Parva, xxxi. p. 87.\n\u00b3 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, lxvi. pp. 192-193.\n\u2074 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, lxvi. p. 186.\n\u2075 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, lxvii. p. 197.\n\u2076 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, pp. 393-395.\nline of descent still to be noted. This is from \u0100riaka, the snake-king, whose capital was in Bhojakata. He was, as I have shown, the reputed ancestor of the Kuntibhojas, and he was also ancestor of Bhishma, king of the eighteen tribes of Bhojas, and the father of Rukini and Rukmini. Now \u0100ryaka is not one of the kings of the five royal snake races, and in two passages coming close together in the legend of M\u0101tali, India\u2019s charioteer already referred to, \u0100ryaka is in one of these said to belong to the Kauravyas, while his grandson, whose mother was an Ir\u0101vata, is said to belong to the Ir\u0101vata race.\u00b9 The name \u0100ryaka is strong evidence of the existence of an Aryan element in the race, which is also partly Dravidian and partly Kolarian. There certainly appears to be a great deal of northern blood among these tribes, and this seems to have come from two separate sources; from the Abhirs of the Delta of the Indus, and from the \u015aiva or K\u0101mbhojas of the Northern Punjab. The country to the East of the Delta of the Indus, the modern Kuteh, is called by Ptolemy Abhiria, or the country of the Abhirs, who have always been identified with the Ahirs, who are found all over Northern India, and are the finest and most warlike of the cattle-herding races. General Cunningham\u2019s suggestion that these Abhirs derived their name from the Abars, one of the branches of the Great Sus tribe of the Euphrates valley,\u00b2 appears to me, for reasons previously given, to be very probably correct. From the subsequent history of the two tribes it seems likely that they were allied to the Sauv\u012bra, and they, like the Sauv\u012bra, may have come from the West, bringing their cattle through Beluchistan by the Quetta route. But besides these Ahirs there is another race of cattle herdsmen on the Indus, who play an important part in history. They are the Bhoja tribe called the K\u0101mbhojas. The fifth rock-edict of A\u015boka, referred to above, in discussing the Yavana, fixes the position of their country very accurately. The Yona-\n\n\u00b9 Udyoga (Bhagavatyana) Parva, cii. p. 312. Her father was V\u0101mana, an Ir\u0101vata king.\n\u00b2 Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, p. 293.\nKambhoja-Gandh\u0101ra are placed close together, and the K\u0101mbhoja must therefore live between these two tribes. Now we have seen that Yona or Yavana are the Kolarian tribes south of the Chen\u0101b, and the K\u0101mbhoja must therefore be north of that river, exactly in the place where Strabo places the \u03a3\u03b9\u03b2\u03bf\u03b9 or \u015aiva. This country was ruled at the time of Alexander the Great\u2019s invasion by the king called by the Greek writers Sopeithes or Sophytes.\u00b9 The people of his country are described by them as the handsomest race in India, and he presented Alexander the Great with fighting dogs, so that they must have been, like the Ahirs of the present day, great sportsmen. These people apparently came, like the Abhirias of the Delta of the Indus, from the West; but they would seem to be distinct from the Abhirs, and possibly were a more northern tribe. Probably the \u015aiva whom we find as vassals of the king of Sindhu-Sauvira, in the account of the attempted abduction of Draupadi,\u00b2 were the Abhiria, for we do not find any evidence in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata that the K\u0101mbhojas were ruled by the king of Sindhu. The two rulers both sent distinct contingents to the Kauravya army, and are everywhere spoken of as independent kings. Kotika, the leader of the \u015aiva in Jayadratha\u2019s army, was evidently one of his most trusted officers, and it was apparently in the delta of the Indus or in their earlier home in the Euphrates valley that the alliance between the cattle-herding and trading races began, which finally resulted in the establishment of the kingdoms of S\u0101keta in Ayodhya and Videha in Mithila (Tirhut). It was probably to this tribe that the Parthian dynasty of kings described by Arrian as ruling at Minnagura, belonged.\u00b3 It is these Bhojas who must have raised the well-known K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r breed of horses, which for size, speed, and stamina are as much superior to all the other native Indian horses as the Guzer\u0101t bullocks are superior to all other breeds of oxen. It is from them that the tribe of Kuntibhojas must have\n\n\u00b9 Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, pp. 157\u2013158.\n\u00b2 Vana (Draupadharana) Parva, cclxiv. p. 782.\n\u00b3 Arrian, Periplus, chap. 38.\nbeen descended, for their name, which means the Bhojas of the lance (Kunta), shows that they were a tribe of light cavalry. Their capital was on the river A\u1e63va or the horse river.\u00b9 And it is their horses which are the famous Bhoja breed, celebrated in the J\u0101taka stories, as being the best of chargers.\u00b2 These Bhojas were apparently quite distinct from the Gandharva or charioteers, as they are also called Vatsas, the calves or sons of the cow, and their country Vatsabh\u016bmi. This name shows that they must have been cattle herdsmen before they became horsemen. What is most probable is that they were a tribe of riding herdsmen like the Ganchos of the Argentine Republic in South America, or the cowboys of Texas. It would have been impossible to tend large herds of cattle in the wide plains of the Cutch country, unless the herdsmen could follow the cattle on horseback, and it was probably these herdsmen who joined the Sauv\u012bra in their progress eastwards. They were also probably allied to, or still more probably the same people as, the \u015aakas or Scythians, who also lived in the Kuntibhoja and Avanti country.\n\nThe whole evidence shows that the Bhoja tribes were a very mixed race. They originally apparently came from Ir\u0101n, where they were a people who claimed to be descended from the cow. They became greatly intermixed with the tribes which were most numerous in the countries where they settled. In the north and east, where the Kauravya, Ir\u0101vata, and Takka races were the dominant tribes, they were closely allied to and intermarried with them. In the countries of Rajputana, Malwa, and K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, where the Kolarian or Yavana element was predominant, they were intimately related to the Kolarians, and it was in the Mathura or Surasena district in the east of this country that the Vrishni Bhojas became half Aryans. In Saur\u0101sh\u1e6dra and the Delta of the Indus they were chiefly connected with the Sauv\u012bra.\n\nThe earliest achievement of the Bhoja tribes recorded in\n\n\u00b9 Yana (Kundal\u0101harana) Parva, cccvii. p. 907. This is considered by Lassen to be one of the western tributaries of the Chambal.\n\u00b2 Buddhist Birth Stories, translated by Rhys Davids, No. 23, p. 245.\nthe Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata was the conquest of the lower valleys of the Nerbudda and Tapti, called the Vidarbha country. It was peopled by Kolarian tribes, as the king of the Vidarbha is mentioned in the list of Krodhavasa kings.\\(^1\\) It was after the Bhojas got possession of it called Ariaki, and it is by this name that the country south of the Tapti is called in Ptolemy's map. I have already shown that \u0100ryaka is called a snake king, and the name shows that it must have been adopted by a people who claimed to be of Aryan descent. These people, to all appearance, claimed to be descended from a snake ancestor, because they found all the royal races of the country making a similar claim. Like the Jews of old who were always falling into idolatry and worshipping the gods of neighbouring tribes, so the northern cattle-owning tribes, ignoring their national descent from the cow, worshipped a snake god and claimed a snake ancestry, because all their neighbours did so. The Brahmins, like the prophets among the Jews, maintained the higher form of worship; but the great mass of the people preferred the gods of the country to those reverenced by their teachers. In doing this they separated religion from morals, and thought that all their religious duties were discharged, and their prosperity secured, by sacrifices offered to obtain the assistance of, or to ward off the wrath of the gods whom they regarded as their ancestors.\\(^2\\)\n\nBut though these people called themselves the sons of the snake Aryaka, their earlier appellation was the sons of Rohini, the cow, and the change from the female line of descent to the male is significant as probably showing the transition from the matriarchal system of relationship to the patriarchal. That the recognized lines of relationship in early times among the Kolarian tribes in India was matriarchal is shown by the account of the matrimonial liberty allowed to the women of the Vidarbha tribe, who were the subjects of King Nila.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Adi (Sambhava) Parva, lxvii. p. 197.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ancestors were probably first worshipped partly from motives of affection, but one very potent cause was also the fear of their ghosts. The aboriginal tribes now practise elaborate ceremonies to remove the ghosts of their dead from their former abodes. It is on this account probably that the Dravidian tribes throw the knee and elbow bones of their dead into the nearest river once a year, keeping them hanging up together meanwhile, so that they may forget the places where they once lived.\n\n\\(^3\\) Sabha (Digvijaya) Parva, xxxi. 89 to 91.\nThe women of this tribe chose their own husbands and dismissed them when they liked. Another proof of the ancient prevalence of the matriarchate are the continual assertions that \"the mother is but the sheath in which the father begets the son, indeed the father is himself the son.\"\u00b9\n\nThe same idea also appears in the descent of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas from Prthu, the daughter of the sun, without the invention of an earthly father. This story seems to have especially struck Megasthenes, as Arrian, who quotes from him, has a long passage about the Surasena being descended from Pand\u00e6a, the daughter of Hercules,\u00b2 by her father, who was, like Hercules, the sun-god.\n\nIt seems to be exceedingly doubtful whether the Bhojas ever called themselves the sons of Yay\u0101ti; but those who were related to the line of Yay\u0101ti called the Ir\u0101vata, and those who came from the north, and either adopted or brought with them from their home in Media their martial gods,\u00b3 called themselves \u0100riaka\u2074 when speaking of themselves as the worshippers or sons of a special god. They usually, however, called themselves, as they do now, Bhojas or Ahirs, while \u015aiva was adopted as a name by those who still worshipped the snake-gods under the form of \u015aiva. They never called themselves Druhyu, which name, as I have shown before, is, as well as the names of the other sons of Yay\u0101ti, an invention of the Aryan bards.\n\nI have now traced the different tribes of Bhojas, and have shown that the K\u0101mbhojas and the Abhiras on the Indus seem to have come from the north and west. Next to these come the sons of Rohin\u012b, all probably descended from a union of the Bhojas from the Euphrates valley, with the Kolarian tribes. The infusion of Kolarian blood probably increased\n\n\u00b9 Adi (Sambhava) Parva, xcv. p. 284. Similar expressions occur in several other places.\n\u00b2 Arrian, Indika, viii.\n\u00b3 By this term I mean Sakko or Sakra, whom I have formerly suggested to be the Scythian war god worshipped under the symbol of the sword, which all Rajput tribes still worship.\n\u2074 The Zendavesta clearly shows that there was a large snake-worshipping population in Media, and the sun-worshippers who lived among them were not the only people who emigrated into India.\namong the more southern tribes, and Rukmi, the king of Bhojakata, is represented as a Krodhavasa king. But the sons of Rohini who went eastward joined themselves with the Aryan Brahmans, and became the sun-worshipping people of Surasena, known as the Vrishnis. It was they who were the Kuntibhojas, and the Sakas named in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata among the list of tribes living close to Mallarashtra in Avanti. Under the name of S\u0101kyas, they led the Ikshv\u0101ku army, and established the great kingdom of Kosala, of which the capital, S\u0101keta, was called by their name, and they were the leaders of the armies of the other Sindhu Suvarna tribes who overran Bengal and Mithila. The Bhojas who lived in the eastern country before the advent of the western tribes appear to be more distinctly Dravidian than those in the west, where there was a much greater intermixture of races.\n\nHaving attempted to disentangle the difficult questions connected with the descent of the Bhojas, I will now proceed to try and sketch out their history as recorded in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. The first question to be considered is as to the share they took in the great war which deprived the Haihayas of the supremacy of the Nerbudda and Tapti valleys. In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata the conquest of the Haihayas is attributed to R\u0101ma, the son of Jamadagni, of the Bharigu race. He is said to have killed Arjuna, the son of Kritavirya, the Haihaya king, with all the Haihayas, because he had killed Jamadagni, his father. Now, as I shall show later on, the Bharigus were certainly not a Bhoja tribe.\n\n1 The Ikshv\u0101kus, i.e. the sons of the Iksha, the sugar cane, are probably the united confederacy of the Suvarna and \u015a\u0101ka Bhojas. Alberni's India Sachau's edition, vol. i. chap. xxi. p. 235, quotes from the Matsya and Vishnu Pur\u0101nas the names of the continents. In the Matsya Pur\u0101na \u015a\u0101kadwipa, or the continent of the \u015a\u0101kas, is said to have a sea of milk (k\u1e63\u012brodaka). The same continent is called Plaksha dwipa in the Vishnu Pur\u0101na, and its sea is said to be of Iksha, the sugar cane. Plaksha is the sacred tree at Pr\u0101yag, the junction of the Jumna and Ganges (Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Vana Tirtha-Yatra Parva, cxxix. p. 390). It is the Pakur (Ficus infectoria), one of the trees belonging to the same family as the Bur or Banyan tree. The story in the Bhavi\u1e63ya Pur\u0101na before alluded to, telling how \u015aamba, son of Krishna, brought priests of the sun from \u015a\u0101kadwipa, shows that it means the Persian and Assyrian country, and therefore the Pur\u0101na traditions show that both the cattle herdsmen, the sons of milk, and the sons of the Iksha, or sugar cane, came from Assyria, and the connection between the Ikshv\u0101ku and the Kolarian races is shown by introduction of the Plaksha, one of the Bur trees, which will be shown to be the distinctive tree of the Kolarians.\n\n2 Vana (Tirtha-Yatra) Parva, cxvi.-cxvii. pp. 358-362.\nBut at the same time R\u0101ma seems to have been an ancestral god of the Bhojas, or cattle tribes, just as V\u0101suki was the god of the Sauvira; for we find that R\u0101ma, the son of Rohin\u012b, is the ancestor of the Dv\u0101raka Bhojas, and R\u0101ma, the son of Da\u00e7aratha, is the ancestral hero of the Bhojas of Ayodhya, who were apparently, as will be shown later, the royal snake race of Kanh\u0101-Gotamakas mentioned in the Chullavagga. The name of R\u0101ma, occurring as the hero of the Haihaya conquest, seems to show that the Bhojas were united with the Bharigus in the war, and subsequent history shows that they took a principal part in it, as we find that they became rulers of the conquered country.\n\nThe further progress of the Bhojas and their allies eastward may be traced in the legend of Ka\u1e47\u1e47a, given in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. Ka\u1e47\u1e47a was, like the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, the son of Prth\u0101, but his father was Arka or Surya the sun.\u00b9 He was born before Prth\u0101 married P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du, and while his mother was living in the Kuntibhoja capital on the river A\u1e63wa. His mother, wishing to conceal his birth, placed him in a basket in the river, and thence the child was floated first down to Charmanvati (Chambal), then to the Jumna, and then to the Ganges, till he reached Champa, the capital of Anga. He was there saved by Radh\u0101, wife of Adhiratha, of the Suta or Charioteer caste.\u00b2 He was thence brought to the court of Dhritar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, was educated with the young Kauravyas and P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, and was finally made king of Anga, the modern Bhagalpur, by Duryodhana, eldest son of Dhritar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra.\u00b3 This story shows that the Kuntibhojas became at one time rulers of Anga, probably at the same time as the Sauvira settled in the adjoining province of K\u0101rna Suvar\u1e47a.\u2074 These people were doubtless the Andhakas, whom we find in the Monghyr inscription,\u2075 as well as in Manu,\u2076 named with the Medas, showing that the two\n\n\u00b9 Yana (Kandalaharana) Parva, cccv.-cccviii. pp. 901-907.\n\u00b2 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, cxi. pp. 330-331.\n\u00b3 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, cxxxviii. and cxxxix. pp. 405 and 406.\n\u2074 The name Ka\u1e47\u1e47a-Suvar\u1e47a being derived from the Karna, the mixed race who worshipped the sun god under the name Karna, and the Suvar\u1e47a.\n\u2075 Asiatic Researches, vol. i. art. iii. p. 62.\n\u2076 Manu, x. 44.\ntribes were close neighbours. These Medas were the Medo-Kaling\u00e6 of Pliny,\\(^1\\) who ruled the Delta of the Ganges beginning at Rajmahal on the Bhagalpur boundary, and the Andhakas were the Bhojas of Dw\u0101raka or K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, who are called in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata Andha Bhojas.\\(^2\\) But the zeal of the Kuntibhojas was not satisfied with the diffusion of the cult of sun worship; it was also they, or rather the branch of the tribe called the Vrishnis, who were the chief apostles of Vishnuism. This, though it afterwards became metaphysical and pantheistic, was apparently in its beginning a strictly ethical movement; one of the principal articles of the creed was the necessity of abstaining from intoxicating drinks. This prohibition was directed against the hard drinking habits of the Kolarian races, and Krishna, as the chief apostle of the temperance crusade, was called the slayer of Madhu or the demon of strong drink,\\(^3\\) while M\u0101dbavi, the daughter of Madhu, was first held to be the mother of the Kolarian tribes, and afterwards became the daughter of Yay\u0101ti in the G\u0101lava legend, already alluded to, which will be fully discussed further on.\n\nThe further great advance of the Sauv\u012bra-Bhojas eastward, and the establishment of the Ikshv\u0101ku kingdom of S\u0101keta, did not take place till long after the period dealt with in the original Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, for though the story of S\u012bt\u0101 and R\u0101ma is given in the poem, it is evidently a much later addition, written long after the time when the Ikshv\u0101ku king was one of the vassals of the king of the Sindhu-Sauv\u012bra.\\(^4\\) The principal leaders in this conquest, as in the earlier conquest of the Haihaya territories in the west, were doubtless the race called in the Chullavagga Ka\u1e47ha or Krishna Gotama races. Their descent is shown by the name Rohin\u012b, given to the river close to the Gautama city of Kapilavastu, where the Buddha was born.\\(^5\\) These Gautamas were at a much later period superseded by the Bais Rajputs, to whom they are said to have given half their territory, and these Bais Rajputs were of the same race as S\u0101liv\u0101hana and the Andhra or Andha kings.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Pliny, Hist.

Their Eastern brethren, the \u015aivas, had doubtless no small influence in the development of the worship of \u015aiva, and the substitution of the one god Mah\u0101deva for the five ancestral snake-gods.\n\nThe Solar Rajput tribes must have been originally descended from the aryanized Vrish\u1e47is and Sakas or Kuntibhojas. When under Brahmin influence Aryan descent was considered to make those who could boast of it superior to their neighbours; the aryanized warrior tribes, who had allied themselves with Aryans and become sun and fire worshippers, called themselves Solar Rajputs. The royal tribes representing the descendants of the kings of the snake races were ranked in the inferior class of Lunar Rajputs. The Solar races, however, long remembered that their ancestors were Bhoja chiefs, and the memory of their original descent is preserved in the name of Bhojpur, by which name the specially Rajput country on the banks of the Ganges east of Benares is still called, and it is the Bhojpuri dialect which is still spoken in Behar.\n\nBh\u0101ratas.\u2014I now come to the Bh\u0101ratas, who were an exceedingly powerful and wide-spread race, who had a large share in working out the history of Northern India. It is they who have given their name to the great Indian epic, as the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is the history of the great Bh\u0101rata. According to the statement in the beginning of the poem,\\(^2\\) it tells the history of the Kurus, Yadus, Bh\u0101ratas, of the sons of Yay\u0101ti and Ikshv\u0101ku, but the main object of the writers was to give the history of the Bh\u0101ratas, and to show how the other tribes were connected with them. The importance of the Bh\u0101ratas is shown by the name Bh\u0101ratavarsha\n\n\\(^1\\) Sir H. Elliot, Supplementary Glossary N.W.P. art. Beis, pp. 58-60.\n\\(^2\\) \u0100di Parva, i. p. 4.\n(the country of the Bh\u0101ratas), which is nearly as well known a name of India among Sanskrit authors as Jambudwipa. Jambudwipa means the island of the Jambu tree:\u00b9 the well-known Jaman tree so universally found throughout Northern India. The name Bh\u0101rata, which is, as I shall show further on, a much later form of the name, is in all probability derived from the name Bur or Banyan tree. In the list of the Buddhas, Kassapa, the last of the Buddhas before the great Gautama, is said to have had his chief city at Benares, his father was Bramadatta the Brahmin. Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja was one of his chief disciples, and the Bur or Banyan tree his sacred tree.\u00b2 Now Kassapa is evidently K\u0101\u015byapa, the son of M\u0101rici, the grandson of Brahma,\u00b3 and the father of gods and men. Bharadv\u0101ja, his chief disciple, was the head of the Brahmin family of that name, who were, as will be shown, the priests of the Bh\u0101ratas, and the people to whom he was priest were the people of the Bur-tree. The name is found everywhere in Northern India in those of provinces and cities, and the river Barna, on which Varanasi or Benares, the city of Kassapa, stands, is the river of the Bars or Burs. Sir H. Elliot says of the Bhars,\u2074 \u201cCommon tradition assigns to them the possession of the whole land from Ghorukpur to Bundelkund and Saugor. The large Pergunnah of Bhudoi in Benares, formerly called Bhurdoi, is called after their name. Many old stone forts, embankments, and subterranean caverns in Ghorukpur, Azimgurh, Jounpur, Mirzapur, and Allahabad are ascribed to them. On the hills to the east of Mirzapur they retain a few principalities: Korar, Koraich, and Huraha, are each held by Bhur Rajas, and the country between Bijaigurh and Chainpur is full of them. The famous fort of Bijaigurh among others is attributed to their being called a Bhuraoti fort.\u201d\u2075\n\n\u00b9 Eugenia Jambolana.\n\u00b2 Faunsb\u00f6ll, J\u0101taka, vol. i. p. 43, sect. 245.\n\u00b3 Adi (Sambhava) Parva, lxv. p. 185.\n\u2074 Elliot\u2019s Supplementary Glossary N.W.P. art. Bhars, pp. 82\u201384.\n\u2075 Mr. Sherring, in an article on the Bhars, J.R.A.S. Vol. V. pp. 376-400, shows how the Bhars were turned out of Allahabad and Fyzabad, both of which districts formerly belonged to them, by successive invasions of Rajput tribes from the West. In the same article, p. 391, he describes the numerous Bhar remains\nMr. Smith, in a paper on the Bhurs of Bundelkund in the Bengal Asiatic Society's Journal,\\(^1\\) shows that out of 250,000 Bhurs in the North-West Provinces, 22,488 are, according to the last census, found in the following districts: Jounpur, 14,605; Azimgurh, 74,144; Benares, 34,805; Ghazipur, 53,060; Ghorukpur, 43,152; Busti, 173,22; so that there are large numbers of Bhurs found now in all the districts between Benares and the Nepal frontier. Mr. Smith further says that though they have been displaced from Bundelkund by the Chandels, yet \"the presence of the Bhurs in the Hamirpore districts is attested by tradition and local names in every Pergunnah.\" Mr. Carnegie, Commissioner of Roy Bareilly, in the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society,\\(^2\\) derives the names of Bhardoi, Bharosa, Bharaich, and also that of the town of Bhartpur from the Bhurs, and if Roy Bareilly owes its name to the Bhurs, the more northern Bareilly is probably derived from the same source; so that, though their numbers may be greater throughout Eastern Oude, there were probably many sections of the tribe scattered throughout the whole of Northern Kosala or Ayodhya.\n\nThe Bhurs were also powerful and numerous in Bengal. On the top of the Bar\u0101bar hill in the Gya district is an ancient temple with a lingam, where a large fair is held. This is said to have been erected by the Bhur Raja of Dinajpur, East of the Ganges.\\(^3\\) People of Bhur origin, more generally called Bauris and Bagdis, are exceedingly numerous throughout Bengal, more especially in the districts of the province or kingdom of Karna-Suvarna. In the Burdwan District these tribes contain the following numbers:\n\n| Tribe   | Number |\n|---------|--------|\n| Bauris  | 82,254 |\n| Bagdis  | 148,148|\n\nTotal: 230,402\n\nfound in the ruins of the ancient Bhar city of Pampapura, near Mirzapur. These show the Bhars to have been a cultured and civilized people.\n\n\\(^1\\) B.A.S.J. vol. xlv. pp. 297 seqq.\n\\(^2\\) B.A.S.J. vol. xlv. p. 303.\n\\(^3\\) Hunter's Gazetteer, s.v. Bar\u0101bar, vol. ii. p. 175.\nIn Bankura the numbers are:\n\nBauris ........... 117,548  \nBagdis ........... 47,146  \n\nTotal......... 164,694\n\nIn Birbhum:\n\nBauris ........... 27,250  \nBagdis ........... 40,030  \n\nTotal......... 67,280\n\nOf these people the Bagdis are generally fishermen, though both they and the Bauris are also cultivators and labourers. They form in Burdwan more than twenty per cent. of the whole Hindoo population, and in Bankura and Birbhum more than ten per cent., so that the river Burr\u0101kar, which flows along the Western boundary of the district they occupy, is rightly called the river of the Burs. This evidence clearly shows that the author of the Harivansa, quoted by Sir H. Elliot,\u00b9 is quite right in saying of the Bars, \u201cThey form an immense family whose numbers it is not possible to mention;\u201d and the Bh\u012bshma Pur\u0101\u1e47a says the Burs are commonly not specified because of their great numbers. But the country of the Bhurs does not end with the large tract extending from the Nepal frontier to Bundelkund and south through Bengal to which I have traced them. There is also the strongest reason to believe that the race extended as far west as the ancient port of Baragyza, the modern Bharoch, which apparently derives its name from the Bars. There is in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata direct evidence that they held lands in Rajput\u0101na, as Bh\u012bma conquered the king of the Bhargas,\u00b2 whose country lay between Vatsabh\u016bmi, the country of the Kuntibhojas and that of the Nishadas. I have already shown that in the days of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata the country of the Kuntibhojas was on the west of the Charmanvati (Chambal), and that\n\n\u00b9 Harivamsa, i. p. 157.  \n\u00b2 Sabha (Digvijaya) Parva, xxx. p. 86.\nof the Nishadas is said in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata to have been on the Sarasvat\u012b close to Vina\u015bana.\u00b9 The country between these two was that of the Matsyas, whose capital is Vir\u0101ta, the modern Bair\u0101t near Joypur,\u00b2 and it is near Bair\u0101t that Lassen, in Kiepert\u2019s map, places the town of Bharatapura. In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata we find the closest possible alliance subsisting between the Aryan P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, the Krish\u1e47as, and the Matsyas; but this last name, which, merely means Fishermen, could not have been the tribal name of this people, and must have been given by people who looked on them as an inferior race. In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, though we do not find the name of the Bhargas as that of a people living in the Matsya country except in the passage quoted above, we find the country usually called Vir\u0101ta. It is therefore exceedingly probable that Vir\u0101tas and Bharatas were the same people, and that the name Vir\u0101ta gives an earlier form of the word. The name Bharga is certainly of later origin, as it is not used in the Vir\u0101ta Parva, which, as I have shown, is a very early part of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. It only knows of nine Rudras, and knows nothing of the eleventh, which is Bharga. The name Bharga was apparently that of the most Western section of the Bharata tribes, among whom the tradition of the sanctity of Bhrigu was current. It was probably only used as the name for the Bharatas of Vir\u0101ta after the addition of the eleventh Rudra, and it was after the change in the numbers of the celestial beings had been made that the legend of Yay\u0101ti and of the descent of his two sons, Yadu and Turvasu, from the grand-daughter of Bhrigu, was elaborated.\n\nIn the list of places given above, which are said to have been named after the Bhurs, the aspirated b used in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and the Rigveda is frequently b or r. This last, which is apparently the older form, appears in the name Barna or Varna, the river on which Benares stands. The further change of a into i, necessary to connect Vir\u0101ta with Bar\u0101ta, is found in the name Birbhum or Virbhum, which was doubtless\n\n\u00b9 Vana (Tirtha Yatra) Parva, cxxx. p. 392.\n\u00b2 Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, p. 340.\noriginally Barabhum, the land of the Bars. This name is still found in that of the Pergunnah of Barabhum in the neighbouring district of M\u0101nbhum, one of those belonging to Karn\u0101 Suvar\u1e47a.\n\nA further proof of the ancient form of the name is found in the list of royal snake-raees given in the Chullavagga. I have already identified two of these races, the Er\u0101patha, with the Ir\u0101vata, or Haihayas, and the K\u0101nha-gotamakas, with the cattle-herding tribes. Considering that the Bars have been shown to have been from time immemorial a numerous and influential people in Kosala or Ayodhya, it is impossible to believe that they should not be mentioned among the royal races of the eastern country. They must, therefore, be the Vir\u016bpakkas, or pakshas, the collection (paksha) of the Vir\u016bs, a description which is exceedingly applicable to such a numerous and wide-spread race, and the name Viru must be one by which they were known in very early times, and most probably was the ancient name of the Vir\u0101ta.\n\nI would, therefore, submit that the above argument gives strong reasons for believing that the earliest form of the name Bh\u0101rata was derived from Bar or Bur, the name of the Bur tree (Ficus Indica). The name afterwards, when applied to a series of tribes, became B\u0101rata, the sons of the Bur tree, and was then changed into Vir or Vira, perhaps from some association with the word Vir, a hero. The country of the Vir\u0101tas would therefore be that of the Western Bh\u0101ratas, and this would make the whole story of the poem of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata much more intelligible and rational than it appears to be at present.\n\nAs the story stands now it seems to be in the last degree absurd that Santanu, the great king of the Kauravyas, the most powerful people in Northern India, should marry Satyavat\u012b, the daughter, not of a king, but of a fisherman.\u00b9 That Satyavat\u012b should, before she married \u015aantana, have become by the Rishi Para\u015bara the mother of the Rishi Vy\u0101sa, otherwise called Krishna Dwaipayana. That this Rishi, though the\n\n\u00b9 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, c. p. 304.\nillegitimate son of a fisherman's daughter, should become the father of \u015aantana's grandsons, Dhritar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, the father of the Kauravyas, and of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du, the reputed father of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. Again, why should Abhimanyu, the son of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava hero Arjuna, and the sister of Krishna, marry Uttara, the daughter of the king of the Matsya, or fishing people,\\(^1\\) or the king of this people become with the king of the Panch\u0101las one of the principal leaders of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava army.\n\nIf the Matsyas were the western representatives of the Bh\u0101rata race, the aspect of the case becomes very different, for their marriages and alliances would unite the Kauravyas and P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas with the most powerful and most widespread race in the country. If the Matsyas or Vi\u015b\u0101las are not Bh\u0101ratas, it is difficult to understand the title of the poem. The whole story leads up to the last great contest between the Panch\u0101las and Matsyas or Vi\u015b\u0101las, headed by the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and Krishna on one side, and the Kauravyas with the Madras or Takkas and the Gandh\u0101ri on the other. It tells of the victory of the side led by the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas; but if the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were the only victorious heroes, what becomes of the title of the poem? It can only be called the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata if it tells of the success of the great Bh\u0101rata, and is quite intelligible if the Vi\u015b\u0101las and Matsyas are Bh\u0101ratas, but not otherwise, for the Panch\u0101las certainly do not belong to the Bh\u0101rata race. If the Vi\u015b\u0101las are Bh\u0101ratas, the story of the poem would be plain. It would tell how the Bh\u0101ratas had gradually, under Aryan guidance, consolidated their hold on the Gangetic valley and the routes to the sea; how they had driven back the Haihayas, and how they finally repelled the northern tribes, and curbed their power of future aggression, by establishing themselves in Dehli, the strategic advantages of which position have been already explained.\n\nBut to return to the evidence as to the Bh\u0101rata power. Strong proof of this is given in the \u0100pri hymns in the Rigveda. There are ten of these hymns, composed as sacri-\n\n\\(^1\\) Vi\u015b\u0101la (Vaiv\u0101hika) Parva, lxxii, pp 182-185.\nficial invocations, arranged in almost precisely the same order in each hymn. In every one of these is a verse calling on the river goddesses to attend the sacrifice, and in seven of them the goddesses invoked are Id\u0101, Bharat\u012b, and Sarasvat\u012b. In two hymns\u00b9 Mah\u012b is used instead of Bharat\u012b. In the \u0100pri hymn of the Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitra or Bh\u0101rata Mandala,\u00b2 Bharati is called to come with the Bh\u0101ratas, Id\u0101 with the gods, Agni with men, and Sarasvat\u012b with her sons. This passage shows clearly that it was customary to speak of tribes as descended from rivers, and a further instance of this custom has been already cited from the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, where the Matsyas are said to be descended from the river Suktimat\u012b and the mountain Kolahala.\u00b3 It seems to me to be perfectly clear, that all these three goddesses were rivers, and that they were specially invoked because these rivers which they personified had a traditional connection with the leading tribes in Northern India. There can be no doubt that Sarasvat\u012b was a river, and in proving what rivers were personified by Bharat\u012b and Id\u0101, it must be remembered that in two hymns Bharat\u012b is also called Mah\u012b. The Mah\u012b must be the river known still by that name, which falls into the Gulf of Cambay, passing through the country of Guzer\u0101t or Baroda. It must have been originally called Barat\u012b, or the river of the Bars, which was afterwards changed into the Mah\u012b or great river, and the name Bar must be preserved in that of Baroda. Further, very strong proof that this was originally a Bar country is furnished by the name Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitra being given to the river on which Baroda stands,\u2074 which is also spoken of under the same name in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata.\u2075 If the country were not a Bh\u0101rata country, the race could not have been called in the very early times in which the name was given, after the bard who is supposed in the Rigveda to especially represent the Bh\u0101ratas.\n\nThe name Id\u0101 is, I believe, no less significant.

The river to which their descent was attributed in the Rigveda was probably the Ir\u0101vat\u012b, or Ravi, or Purush\u1e47i of the Panjab, which may perhaps have also been adopted as a parent river when the Haihayas were the dominant power not only in the East but also in the West. That the memory of them in the West, and the worship of their ancestral god Ir\u0101vata or Il\u0101putra (the son of I\u1e37a), were preserved to a late period, is shown by the fact that it was he who was the god of the great temple of Soman\u0101th, the lord of Soma the moon, where \u015aiva was worshipped under the form of the linga adorned with the crescent moon. The connection between Somn\u0101th and Il\u0101putra is indicated by Sir A. Cunningham,\u2074 who shows that it is most probable that the city of Patan Somn\u0101th was the same as that in which the fort and temple of El\u0101pura were built by Krishna, the Pahlava prince, in 720 A.D. This conjecture, if correct, would show Il\u0101putra was the god who was afterwards worshipped as \u015aiva. The name R\u0101vataka, given in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata to the hills overlooking Dv\u0101raka, is certainly connected with Ir\u0101vata.\u2075\n\nI have thus shown that the three river-goddesses invoked in the Rigveda are those of the Aryans, the Bh\u0101ratas, and the Haihayas, and that both the last two tribes were exceedingly\n\n\u00b9 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, xciv. p. 282.\n\u00b2 Vishnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a, chap. iv.\n\u00b3 This is a corroboration of the conjecture that the Purus are representatives of the snake races in general.

By this time, when the Rigveda hymns were written, the power of the Haihayas had apparently been considerably broken, and they had been driven South by the allied Yadavas and Turvasus. In tracing the history of the contest onwards, the Bh\u1e5bigus become exceedingly prominent, and these Bh\u1e5bigus I believe to be a Bh\u0101rata tribe. We find in two hymns of the eighth Mandala of the Rigveda the Bh\u1e5bigus and the Yatis mentioned together.\\(^1\\) In the first of these passages Indra is asked to give the bard and his people the same courage and knightly skill with which he helped the Yatis, Bh\u1e5bigus and the sons of Kanva; and in the second the Yati race and the Bh\u1e5bigus are said to be dear to Indra. The Yatis are evidently the sons of Yay\u0101ti, and the Kanvas were, as I have shown, a family of Western Brahmins, who were intimately connected with the Yadu and Turva\u1e63u. The Bh\u1e5bigus or Bhargavas are in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, in the story of the slaughter of the Haihayas by R\u0101ma of the Bh\u1e5bigu race, spoken of partly as a family of ascetics and partly as warriors, but in another passage they are said to be a wealthy people whom the Haihayas plundered.\\(^2\\) That they were also a fighting race is clear, not only from the passages of the Rigveda quoted above, but also from the fact that they were one of the tribes who opposed the Trtsus in the battle of the ten kings. The Bh\u1e5bigus were thus in the forefront of the battle with the Druhyus or Bhojas, and close behind the Turva\u1e63u and Matsya, and they were also evidently joined as warriors with the Bhojas in the conquest of the Nerbudda\n\n\\(^1\\) Rigv. viii. 3. 9; viii. 6. 18. The mention of the Bh\u1e5bigus and Yatis together here seems to show that the legend of the descent of the tribes of the West from Yay\u0101ti had its origin in the Avanti and Nerbudda country. It will be recollected that Devayani, the wife of Yay\u0101ti and the mother of Yadu, and Turva\u1e63u, was the grand-daughter of Bh\u1e5bigu, and the legends of the Bh\u1e5bigus are all confined to the country bordering on the Nerbudda. In that case the order of the sons of Yay\u0101ti would be given according to the position of the tribes descended from the beginning from the south. First come the Yadus and Turva\u1e63us; that is, the Yadus, or the arianized cattle-herding races, and the Turva\u1e63us, or the arianized forest tribes, answering to the Yavanas. Then the Druhyu or Bhojas, answering to the Kambojas. Next the Anu, who are the Kolarian tribes north of the Purushni, and last of all the Purus, the Kur\u016b-Takkas or city-builders.\n\n\\(^2\\) \u0100di (Chitra-ratha) Parva, clxix. pp. 512\u2013514.\nand Tapti valleys. The objection that the Bh\u1e5bigus cannot be Bharatas, but must be Aryans, because there were Brahmin ascetics among them, cannot hold against the innumerable proofs in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata that there were Brahmin ascetics and Rishis who were not Aryans. Vy\u0101sa, the son of the Matsya princess Satyavat\u012b, was certainly not an Aryan, and in the discourse of Yudishthira with Nahusha the serpent about the intermixture of races, which has been already quoted, he does not exempt the Brahmans, for he says: \"A Brahmana is not a Brahmana by birth alone, but it is said by the wise that he in whom these virtues are seen is a Brahmana.\" I have already shown that the Bharatas are called Bhargas, and in the account of the contest between R\u0101ma the son of Da\u015baratha and R\u0101ma of the Bh\u1e5bigu race, the latter is called Bhargava,\u00b9 and the same term is applied to Sukra, the father of Devayani, by Vrisha-parva, the father of Sharmisht\u0101.\u00b2 It would appear, as I have said before, that the name Bharga is connected with the eleventh Rudra, and the question connected with this will be dealt with later on. Here it must suffice to point to the name Baragyza, which seems to be derived from the Bars, and to show that the tribe belonging to that race in the West used a guttural g in their name, and this will account for the Bharatas being called Bhargas.\n\nI have thus traced the Bharatas right across India, and have shown that in the early history of the Vedic and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata eras the recorded wars in which they took a part were in the West. They were also, as I have shown, a numerous and powerful people in the East, but their history in that part of the country does not come under the notice of Sanskrit authors till the Western tribes had established their rule in that part of the country. The Bhojas or Rajput tribes, in their progress eastward, as I have before shown, dispossessed the Bhars, and though according to the story in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, R\u0101ma the Bh\u1e5bigu goes to Ayodhya to meet R\u0101ma the son of Dasaratha,\u00b3 the real fact was doubt-\n\n\u00b9 Vana (Tirtha-Yatra) Parva, xcix. pp. 316-317.\n\u00b2 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, lxxx. p. 245.\n\u00b3 Vana (Tirtha-Yatra) Parva, xcix. p. 315.\nless the other way; instead of the Bh\u1e5bigus going from the West to Ayodhya, R\u0101ma, Dasaratha\u2019s son, who represented the Bhojas coming from the West, found them there. They being the Bars, who have been shown to have been formerly so numerous and powerful in Eastern Ayodhya.\n\nAs for the origin of the Bh\u0101ratas I would submit that the evidence hitherto given points to their being Kolarians. I have shown that the Vir\u0101tas were almost certainly Bh\u0101ratas, and also that they were a people similar in their habits to the Kolarian race, otherwise they would not have kept up the Kolarian dances. The evident connection between them and the Bur tree also points to a Kolarian origin, for the Dravidians would have called themselves the sons of the tree. Trees were afterwards reverenced by the Dravidians as the children of the earth and the signs of its generative power, but they never would have called the tree their father. The Kolarians, on the contrary, looked on the trees of the village Surna as the home of the local god. These local gods were the totems and gods or eponymous ancestors of the people living within their jurisdiction, they would therefore naturally call the trees where these gods lived their father, and themselves the sons of the trees growing in the sacred grove. In looking for a tree which could be described as the common father of so numerous a tribe as the Bh\u0101ratas, it is impossible to select one which was so pre-eminently fitted to be the representative tree of the people of India as the Banyan tree, which is especially peculiar to the country.\u00b9\n\nBut though the Bh\u0101ratas were apparently originally Kolarians, they were also included among the snake races. I have shown that it is probable that they were the Vi\u015bu\u1e63pakshas, and I shall now show that they are almost certainly the Dhritar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dh-\n\n\u00b9 But perhaps the earliest form of the name B\u0101rata came from the Mundari (Kolarian) word buru \u2018a hill,\u2019 and that as the Kolarians preferred living in the hilly tracts, they called themselves the sons of the hill, mountains being an especial object of their worship. But the Kolarian tribes who settled in the low country could not any longer justify the name of sons of the hill. They therefore called themselves sons of the Bur or hill-like tree, in which their mountain god was supposed to reside on accompanying his votaries to their new abode. The whole question is discussed further on in p. 292 with reference to the chronological indications given by the adoption of this and similar names.\ntras of the five royal races of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. I have already identified the V\u0101suki, Takshakas, Ir\u0101vata, and Kauravya among these races, and there only remains the Dhritar\u0101shtra.\n\nIn one passage in the beginning of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata Dhritar\u0101shtra is called the brother of Ir\u0101vata,\u00b9 and Yudhisthira says he is the first of all N\u0101gas.\u00b2 Both Dhritar\u0101shtra and Ir\u0101vata live in the country north-east of the Ganges, or the country of Kosala, where there are said to be many habitations of snakes.\u00b3 The shrine of Kapila, called in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata the king of the N\u0101gas,\u2074 is in that country, and he is the same Kapila who in the Buddhist records is said to be the Brahmin Rishi, who gave the Sakyas the site of Kapilavastu, where the Buddha was born.\n\nThis country is, as I have shown, the ancestral home of the Bh\u0101ratas and Ir\u0101vata, and as the Haihayas are Ir\u0101vata, the Bh\u0101ratas must be Dhritar\u0101shtra. But Dhritar\u0101shtra in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is not only the first of N\u0101gas, but he is also the father of the Kaurava princes and the brother of P\u0101ndu. This Dhritar\u0101shtra, the blind king of the Kauravyas, is a mythical personage, and the Dhritar\u0101shtra whom the poet made into the blind king and father of the heroes commemorated in it is the legendary father of the Bh\u0101ratas regarded as a snake race. This is shown by the story of the hundred sons born to him and his wife Gandh\u0101r\u012b at one birth. These hundred sons are evidently the ancestors of the numerous branches of the Bh\u0101rata race. Among these sons are Viudu and Anuvindu,\u2075 who afterwards appear as the kings of Avanti, or Ujjen, first in the conquests of Sahadeva,\u2076 and afterwards in the list of Kauravya forces gathered for the last great battle with the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas.\u2077 We also find among these sons Chitravarma, who is said in another place to be the Asura Vir\u016bpaksha,\u2078 showing the identity of\n\n\u00b9 \u0100di (Pausiya) Parva, iii. p. 56.\n\u00b2 Vir\u0101ta (Pandava Pravesa) Parva, iii. p. 4.\n\u00b3 \u0100di (Pausiya) Parva, iii. p. 56.\n\u2074 Vana (Tirtha-Yatra) Parva, lxxx. p. 267.\n\u2075 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, lxvii. p. 199.\n\u2076 Sabha (Digvijaya) Parva, xxxi. p. 88.\n\u2077 Udhyoga (Amvapakhya) Parva, cxvii. p. 559.\n\u2078 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, lxvii. p. 194, see p. 284.\nthe Bh\u0101ratas and Vir\u016bpakshas. The great king of Magadha, Jarasandha, also appears as one of Dhritar\u0101sh\u1e6dra\u2019s sons, showing that the Bh\u0101ratas were among the earliest inhabitants of Magadha. But besides Dhritar\u0101sh\u1e6dra and his hundred sons there is also another hero of a race which I have identified with the Bh\u0101ratas, who has also a hundred sons. This is \u0100rya, said in one place to be the grandson of B\u1e5bigu,\u00b9 and in another the renovator of the B\u1e5bigu race when it was nearly destroyed by the Kshatryas under Kritavriya, the Haihaya king.\u00b2 This is a further proof of the identity of the B\u1e5bigus with the Bh\u0101ratas in addition to those I have already urged. It seems, for the above reasons, clear that the Bh\u0101ratas were the snake races who claimed Dhritar\u0101sh\u1e6dra as their ancestor, but Dhritar\u0101sh\u1e6dra is clearly a Sanskrit compound meaning \u201che who holds the kingdoms together,\u201d and could not have been the tribal name of the Bh\u0101ratas. This was, as I have shown, a word derived from the root Bur. This original name was given them when the snake tribes introduced the custom of amalgamating the different totemistic ancestors of the several tribal sections into one common ancestor of the whole tribe. The Kolarian people could not call themselves sons of the snake as the earth-worshipping tribes did, but they called themselves the sons of the tree, which was the home of their gods, and they adopted the Bur tree as their distinctive tree. This change took place through Haihaya influence, and hence Dhritar\u0101sh\u1e6dra, the reputed ancestor, afterwards called the father of the Burs, was said to be the brother of Ir\u0101vata. The two tribes evidently amalgamated in their ancient home in Kosala much in the same way as the Dravidian Ooraons and the Kolarian Mundas now live together in Chota N\u0101gpore. The government is founded on the village and provincial divisions of the Kolarians, but though the form has been altered so as to suit Dravidian ideas of centralization and national discipline, the Kolarians have a share in the government, which is not entirely in Dravidian hands, and hold village offices in their own\n\n\u00b9 Adi (Sambhava) Parva, lxvi. p. 192.\n\u00b2 Adi (Chaitraratha) Parva, clxix. pp. 512\u2013517.\nvillages just as the Dravidians do in theirs. Throughout a great part of the country, especially in the central provinces of Khukra and Lodma, the two races remain apart, though living in contiguous villages; the Mundas living in some villages, and the Ooraons in others, while in some they live together. In the other parts of the country the people are all Mundas, and in some all Ooraons; and in the frontier provinces, especially those to the south of the old kingdom of Manblhum, a mixed race called Bhunij has sprung up, descended from Munda and Dravidian parentage. This is, I believe, also the case with the Bauris before noted as the representative Bars of Bengal. Similarly the Bh\u0101rata race must have originally sprung from a mixture of Kolarian and Dravidian elements, but the great superiority that the Bh\u0101ratas gained in later times was due to Aryan and Sauv\u012bra guidance, and to the intermingling of the blood of these tribes with that of the B\u0101ratas and Ir\u0101vatas.\n\nGandh\u0101ri.\u2014But these do not comprise all the elements which combined to form the B\u0101rata race. There was another and most important tribe to which both they and the Aryans owed a great deal of their success in civilizing the country. This was the tribe of the Gandh\u0101ri who have been so frequently mentioned before in this paper. The wife of Dhritar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra was a Gandh\u0101ri, and it was she who was the mother of his hundred sons. I have before shown that the Gandh\u0101ri were the tribe who occupied the Kabul country at the time of Alexander the Great\u2019s invasion, who were called \u0100\u1e63vaka, the cavaliers or the sons of the horse. I have identified them with the Chitraratha or Charioteers, and the Prthu or Parthians. Throughout the Rigveda and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata all the principal warriors fight from chariots, and the race of charioteers were a most important and influential people, and the best and most valuable gift that could be given to a bard was a horse. The most important sacrifice in the ritual of the early Indian kings was the \u0100\u1e63vamedha or horse sacrifice,\u00b9 and the time of its performance was a pecu-\n\n\u00b9 Janamejaya, son of Puru, is said to have performed three horse sacrifices. Adi (Sambhava) Parva, xciv. p. 283.\nliarly auspicious season for securing an heir to the throne.\\footnote{Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 36; Satapatha Brahmana, 13. 2. 8. 3.}\n\nIn the Satapatha Brahmana it is said that the queen of the king who is about to perform the sacrifice must sleep with the horse that is to be offered the night before it takes place.\n\nIn the Mahabharata the Gandharvi, who are in some passages described like the Bhargava as heavenly and supernatural beings, also appear as Charioteers. Gandharvi, their ancestress, is the sister of Rohini, and the mother of all horses. The tribes who were the sons of horses (Asvaka) appear in the Mahabharata in two different parts of the country. First in the North, where they are the Gandhari, the people whose king is called by Hiouen Tsiang Asvapati or the lord of horses;\\footnote{Beal, Buddhist Records of the Western World, vol. i. p. 13 note. He is called the king of the North, and Asvapati is mentioned in the Mahabharata as one of the Asuras, the sons of Danu, the father of the snake races. Adi (Sam-bhava) Parva, lxv. p. 186.} and secondly, in the land of the Kichaka. This last country is situated on the Ganges, and it was here that the Pandavas met Chitraratha, the Gandharva king, after they had wandered through the countries of the Trigartas, Matsyas, and Panchalas,\\footnote{Adi (Hidimva-badha) Parva, clviii. p. 458.} when they were escaping from the Kauravyas, who had tried to burn their house. The mention of the Kichaka country as the last of those traversed by the Pandavas distinctly shows that it lay beyond and next to that of the Panchalas; but the name Kichaka gives a perfectly exact clue to its position. Kichaka means the hill bamboo, and it would be impossible to find a more appropriate name for the country to the South of the Ganges between Benares and the Kaimur Vindhya range than the land of the hill bamboo. Whatever soil there is on the northern slopes of the Kaimur Vindhyas is exceedingly poor, as it is composed of disintegrated sandstone rock. The hill bamboo is almost the only tree on many parts of the rocky and almost precipitous sides of the hills, and it grows everywhere throughout the country. Strangers coming from the very different vegetation of the Doab would naturally speak of it as the bamboo land. The soil of the plains\nstretching from the river to the base of the hills is exceedingly dry and flat, and well suited for horses.\n\nChitraratha is the mythical name generally used for the Gandharva kings, and this visit of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas to the K\u012bchaka territory is an entirely mythical story; but that the country was occupied and ruled by horse owning tribes at the time of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is a perfectly true historical fact. The king of the Gandharva, called by the name of Chitraratha, is said to have given 400 horses as tribute to Yudishthira.\u00b9 But we also find another king of the Gandharva called Hansa,\u00b2 who was one of the generals of Jarasandha, king of Magadha, and who ruled the K\u012bchaka country. He and another Gandharva king called Dimvaka or Chitrasena, drove the Yadavas from Mathura in the great war between the East and West, which seems to have been a real not a mythical contest.\u00b3 Hansa is also called Ku\u1e63ika,\u2074 and it is through this name that it appears to be possible to trace accurately the progress of the Gandharvas from the North to the Benares district, which formed part of the tract called K\u012bchaka.\n\nI have already shown that the chief town of the Gandh\u0101ri near the Indus was Kasyaka or Kasyapura.\u2075 This is precisely the same name as that of Ka\u1e63i assigned to Benares, and it also contains that of the Ku\u1e63iku or Kau\u1e63ika, the tribe to whom Benares belonged.\u2076 This country was, as we have seen, also the country of the Gandh\u0101rvi or Gandhari, and it is therefore exceedingly probable that Benares got its name of Ka\u1e63i from the Ku\u1e63ika tribe who emigrated there from the banks\n\n\u00b9 Sabha (Dyuta) Parva, iii. p. 145.\n\u00b2 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, lxvii. p. 198.\n\u00b3 Sabha (Rajasuyarambha) Parva, xiv. pp. 46 and 47.\n\u2074 Sabha (Jaras\u0101ndhabhadha) Parva, xxii. p. 69.\n\u2075 Prof. A. Weber, India and the West in Old Days, p. 6, gives the name as Kasyakapura.\n\u2076 It is also the city of Kassapa the Buddha, which gives a further identification of the name. The capital of the Gandharvas of the K\u012bchaka country is in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata said to be Ekachakra, which is also mentioned among the nineteen capitals of the sons of Okkako (Ikshv\u0101ku) named in the Tika or abridged commentary on the Mah\u0101vamsa by Mah\u0101n\u0101mo. Turnour's Mahavamsa, Preface, p. xxxv. Ekachakra is probably the city of Pampapura mentioned in note 5, p. 280. It was like Ka\u1e63i both a Bar and Gandh\u0101ra city, which was subsequently ruled by Ikshv\u0101ku kings.\nof the Indus, settled in the Gangetic Doab as the \u015ar\u1e45jaya or P\u0101rtha, occupied Benares, and gave to it the same name as they had given to their town on the Indus. But they were not the original founders of either town. Kasyakapura or Multan was, as we have seen, a town of the Kolarian Malli, just as Benares was a town of the Kolarian Bars.\n\nSpecial evidence as to the connection between the Ka\u015bis, or Ku\u015bikas and the horse-sacrifice is given in the Vajasaney\u0101 and the Taittirya Samhitas in the passage where the queen, who is obliged to sleep with the horse, remonstrates against the order.\\(^1\\) In doing so she speaks to Amb\u0101, Ambik\u0101, and Amb\u0101lik\u0101. Now these three names are those given in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata to the daughters of the king of Ka\u015bi, who were taken by Bhishma, son of \u015aantanu, as wives for his brother Vichitta Virya.\\(^2\\) The occurrence of these three names in the conversation about the horse sacrifice points to a special connection between the Ku\u015bikas, the custom of sacrificing horses and the rules regulating the sacrifice.\n\nBut the derivation of these names, which is given in another part of the poem, gives a further and very curious insight into the national traditions of the Ku\u015bikas. Vrihad-ratha, the king of Magadha, and son of V\u0101su, king of Chedi, had, like Santanu\u2019s son Vichitta Virya, married two daughters of the king of Ka\u015bi, but had no son. He asked the Rishi Chandra-Ku\u015bika (the moon of the Ku\u015bikas), who belonged to the family of Gautama, to procure one for him. The Rishi caused an am, or mango fruit, to fall into the laps of his two queens, and from their eating this Jarasandha was miraculously born, half being born from each queen.\\(^3\\) Now the names of the daughters of the king of Ka\u015bi who married Vichitta Virya mean the daughters of the Am, or Mango tree, and the births of Jarasandha and Dhritar\u0101shtra and Pa\u1e47\u1e0du in the two stories are strictly analogous. In the one Dhritar\u0101shtra and Pa\u1e47\u1e0du are the sons of the two queens Amvik\u0101 and Amvalik\u0101 by the help of the Rishi Vy\u0101sa,\n\n\\(^1\\) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 36; V.S. 23. 18; Taitt.

But in both Dhritar\u0101shtra and P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du and also Jarasandha are descended from the K\u016b\u1e63\u012bka, and are said to be sons of the Mango tree.\n\nIt would seem from these legends that the K\u016b\u1e63\u012bkas, or Gandh\u0101ri, had, like the Bars, adopted the Kolarian tree worship, and called themselves the son of a tree, the Bars being the son of the Bar tree, and the K\u016b\u1e63\u012bkas of the Am or Mango tree. But though the Bars were apparently a Kolarian tribe, the K\u016b\u1e63\u012bkas, or Gandh\u0101ri, certainly came from the north.\n\nBut though they were not aboriginal inhabitants of India, they apparently came into the country very early, nearly as soon as the Ir\u0101vata, and about the same time as the first of the cattle-herding races. Like the Bhojas, who called themselves the sons of the cow, and worshipped that animal as their ancestor, they allied themselves to the horse. These two ancestors are not named among the five royal snakes in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, but they appear among the seven snake-kings of Nishadha, or the country of Northern India in the Matsya Pur\u0101\u1e47a.\u00b9 There the seven snake-kings are Ananta, answering to Dhritar\u0101shtra in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, and called there the king of snakes,\u00b2 V\u0101suki, Takshaka, Karkotaka (Kauravya), Mah\u0101padma (Ir\u0101vata), Kambala (ancestor of the K\u0101mbojas), and A\u015bvatara (ancestor of the Gandh\u0101rvi).\n\nA further proof that the Gandh\u0101ri, or Gandharva, were one of the original tribes of India, who were settled there long before the days of Aryan rule, is given in the Gandh\u0101rva form of marriage. This and the Rakshasa form of marriage are said by Manu to be permitted to Kshatriyas.\u00b3 The different forms of marriage are given in a much more elaborate and evidently a later form than that set forth in the earlier treatise of Gautama, which doubtless better\n\n\u00b9 Alberuni's India, edited and translated Dr. Sachau, chap. xxiii. vol. i. p. 247.

Gautama\\(^1\\) describes three forms of marriage which are not strictly lawful to Aryans, and which are therefore those which were common to non-Aryan tribes. These are the Gandh\u0101rva, the \u0100sura, and the R\u0101kshasa form. In defining them he says, \u201cThe spontaneous union with a willing maiden is called a Gandh\u0101rva wedding. That celebrated when those who have authority over the bride are propitiated with money is called an \u0100sura wedding. If the bride is taken by force, it is called a R\u0101kshasa wedding.\u201d The R\u0101kshasa, or marriage by capture, is still preserved in the forms of a Kolarian wedding, where the bridegroom places the bride on his hip and carries her round the wedding party, and the Kolarian tribes are constantly called R\u0101kshasas. The \u0100sura wedding is the common form among the Dravidian tribes, and the name Asura is that given to those tribes who are called in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata the sons of Danu or D\u0101nava. The Gandharva wedding must therefore be that common among the Gandharvi, or horse-owning tribes.\n\nIn tracing the tribes with which the Gandh\u0101ri are allied I have shown that the Gandh\u0101ri tribe of the Ku\u015bikas was closely connected with the Bars, and that they gave their own name of Ka\u1e63i, or the city of the Ku\u1e63is, to the Bar city of Benares. A further connection between them and the B\u0101ratas in the north is shown in a tradition recorded in the Vish\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a,\\(^2\\) which makes Pushkara, the son of Bh\u0101rata, the founder of Pushkalavati, one of the names of Hastinapora, the capital of the Gandh\u0101ri on the Swat river. In the similar tradition in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata Hasti, the great-grandson of Bh\u0101rata, is said to have built the city. But the connection between the Gandh\u0101ri, or the people of the north, and the B\u0101ratas of the east, is most clearly set forth in the genealogy of Dhritar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and his predecessors given in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata.\\(^3\\) There Janamejaya, the son of Puru, and grandson\n\n---\n\n1.

Adi (Sambhava) Parva, xcv. p. 283.\nof Yay\u0101ti, marries Anant\u0101, the daughter of M\u0101dhava (i.e. the Kolarian). I have shown that in the Matsya Pur\u0101\u1e47a Ananta (the infinite) is called king of the snake race, to which the Bharatas were said to belong before their ancestor received the more elaborate Sanskrit name of Dhritar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. In tracing their descent from Ananta (infinity), the race was said to extend far back to the primordial time which is beyond the bounds of memory. That this race ruled in the east is shown by the name of Janamejaya's successor Prachiyav\u0101n, from Pr\u0101chya the East, who is said to have conquered the eastern countries. But in subsequent parts of the genealogy all the different races from which the Bharata race was composed are most clearly set forth. The union between the Bharatas and the Ka\u015b\u012bs is shown in the marriage of Bharata with the daughter of the king of Ka\u015b\u012b. But the complete statement of the ancestors of the Bharatas is given in the steps of the pedigree immediately preceding the birth of Bharata. After giving the alliance with the Aryans in the marriage of Matinara with the Sarasvat\u012b, we come to their grandson Ilina and his descendants, which are stated as follows:\n\nIlina = Rathantar\u0101.\n\nDushmanta = \u015aakuntal\u0101, the daughter of Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitra, or rather of the river M\u0101lin\u012b.\n\nBharata = Sunand\u0101, daughter of Sarvasena, king of Ka\u015b\u012b.\n\nHere we have the union between the son of Ila, belonging to the Ir\u0101vata, with Rathantar\u0101, the daughter of the Ratha or chariot; of their son Dushmanta with the Kolarian \u015aakuntal\u0101, and of the establishment of the race in Benares.\n\nPanch\u0101las.\u2014I have now gone through all the principal races of Northern India as recorded in the Rigveda and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, with the one exception of the Panch\u0101las. I have spoken of this race under the name of \u015ar\u1e45jaya, which they bear in the Rigveda, and have identified them with the Prthu, or P\u0101rtha, mentioned in the Vedic hymns. But the name Panch\u0101la clearly shows that they were not a pure race, but points to five united races. These five races would naturally\nbe interpreted to mean the five snake races, but this interpretation is impossible, for it would include the Kurus, or Kauravyas, among the five races, whereas the name Kuru-Panch\u0101la, afterwards given to what was once the Panch\u0101la country, shows them not to be one of the people comprised under the common name of Panch\u0101la. I have shown further that the Kurus were united with the Takkas under the common name of Vaikarna. Therefore there only remain three of the five snake races to make up the Panch\u0101la. The identification of the \u015ar\u1e45jaya with the Prithu, or P\u0101rtha, and of the same race with the Ku\u015bikas, clearly shows that they must be included among the five tribes, and the other tribe is doubtless the \u015aiva, or the cattle-herdsmen. I have shown also that the Matsya Pur\u0101\u1e47a names seven snake kings instead of five, and that two of these, Kambala and Asvatara, are the ancestors of Bhojas and Gandharva. I have also shown that the V\u0101suki had very early made their way into the Panch\u0101la country, so that there is, I would submit, little doubt that the five united tribes were the V\u0101suki, Ir\u0101vata, B\u0101rata, Bhojas, and Gandharva. A country so naturally fertile, and one watered by two magnificent rivers which gave special facilities for trade to the people living on its banks, must always have been crowded by immigrants as soon as stable governments were formed, and it is therefore not to be wondered at that the population should be mixed, and the tribes not separately discriminated, as they were in other parts of the country.\n\nIn this confederation the P\u0101rtha, \u015ar\u1e45jaya, or Ku\u015bikas, were apparently supreme. They certainly take the most prominent place in the Rigveda, and it is Drupada, the king of the Panch\u0101la, who is, with the king of the Vir\u0101ta, the principal leader of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava armies. His importance is also shown in the fact that it is his daughter who is selected as the wife of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, showing that his alliance as the most powerful king of the Gangetic valley was necessary to those who wished to unite the tribes living in the south of Northern India against the aggressors from the north.\n\nThe history which I have now attempted to trace extends\nvery far back into the past. I have shown that the trade of India was nearly, if not quite as large in times long antecedent to the coming of the Aryans as it was after they had established their supremacy in the country. I have shown that the earliest stable governments were founded by the Haihaya races, who are the ancestors of the modern Gonds; that it was through the union between them, the B\u0101ratas and V\u0101syas, or trading races, that the country was cultivated, its mineral treasures explored and made saleable, manufactures started, and foreign trade created. I have traced the connection between the snake-worshipping tribes of India and those of Assyria, and have shown that the Indian snake-races probably derived their religious doctrines, as well as their system of astronomical calculations, from Assyria, and it was from the same country that the Sau or merchant tribes originally came. All these events must have occurred ages before the Rigveda was thought of, before the legends of Yay\u0101ti and Nahusha, which were known to its authors, were first put into shape, and before the Aryan gods of the heavens began to contend with the snake gods of the earth.\n\nIn the early dawn of Indian civilization the gods were those of the earth worshipped under the symbols of the snake or the tree, the latter being derived from the Kolarian tribes. The most powerful, practical, and most influential section of the people were the worshippers of the snake. It was from them that the Kolarian races adopted the practice of taking special trees as their tribal gods, and calling themselves the sons of a special tree. Thus the B\u0101ratas, the principal Kolarian race, became the sons of the Bur, or Banyan tree. The horse-owning tribes, who were originally the sons of the horse, the sons of the Am or Mango tree, and also of A\u1e63vatara, called, in spite of his name, a snake. Similarly, the cattle herdsmen, who were the sons of the cow, became first the sons of the snake Kambala, and afterwards of the snake \u0100riaka.\n\nAssyrian and Egyptian history gives, as I have shown, some data for determining the time when the country was sufficiently civilized to trade with foreign lands. This must\nhave been long before the Aryan dialects became the common language of the people. But there is another very valuable guide for tracing the original universality of earth worship, showing its Assyrian origin and the confusion caused by the introduction of the Aryan mythology into the astronomy, which was originally imported from the Euphrates valley.\n\n**Astronomical Evidence.**\u2014It has been already shown that the twenty-seven Nakshatras, or Lunar mansions, were introduced into India from Chald\u00e6a. From the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata it is clear that the lunar system of reckoning time must have been the earliest known in the country. It is there said that Daksha\\(^1\\) gave twenty-seven of his daughters as wives to Chandra (or \u015aoma), the moon, called afterwards the Nakshatras, and thirteen to Kasyapa, the father of the Indian races.\\(^2\\) This clearly means that the first mode of reckoning time was by a lunar year of twenty-six Nakshatras of fourteen days each, making thirteen months of twenty-eight days each, and not twelve months of thirty days each, which was the number given in the later lunar year.\\(^3\\) This would give a year of 364 days, and the remaining Nakshatra is required to supply supplementary days in successive years to make up the full number of 365 days. These Nakshatras appear as Rudras in a subsequent system made to include the gods of the solar and lunar year, and the whole number must therefore have been reckoned in the original thirty-three gods\\(^4\\) of the lunar year. All Hindoo astronomical calculations are based on the number of thirty-three gods, though in some cases they are multiplied by thousands. The lunar system therefore started with the moon and his twenty-seven wives, making twenty-eight.\n\nI have found no direct evidence to show who were the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, lxvi. p. 189, where traces of the different changes in the chronological reckoning are to be found.\n\n\\(^2\\) The statement in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, lxvi. p. 180, is as follows: \u201cIt is known also throughout the world that the wives of \u015aoma (the moon) are twenty-seven, and the wives of \u015aoma, all of sacred vows, are employed in indicating time, and they are the Nakshatras and the Yoginis, and they become so for assisting the courses of the world.\u201d\n\n\\(^3\\) Alberuni\u2019s India, edited and translated by Prof. E. Sachan, chap. xxxv. p. 350, vol. i.\n\n\\(^4\\) These are the thirty-three gods of the T\u0101vat\u012bmsa (belonging to thirty-three) heavens in the Buddhist cosmogony. Sakko (Sakra or Indra) is the head of these thirty-three gods.\u2014Childers, P\u0101li Diet., s.v. T\u0101vat\u012bmsa.\nremaining five gods required to make up the thirty, but I would suggest that they probably were the five snakes or five planets.\\(^1\\) There was certainly a most intimate connection between Moon worship and the snake races, as all their descendants are called up to the present day Lunar Rajputs or Sombansi, sons of the Moon.\n\nThis ancient mode of calculation was necessarily superseded when the solar year came to be used, but the conservative astronomers who introduced the change still retained the original number of the thirty-three gods, who were originally represented in the lunar year. In showing how this change was effected, I shall not discuss the astronomical side of the question further than is necessary for showing the way in which the thirty-three gods were preserved, as this gives most valuable information as to the history of the country. There is distinct evidence in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata of two stages in the process, one of which was effected before sun-worship superseded moon-worship, and before Aryan influence was supreme; while the second distinctly shows the predominance both of sun-worship and Aryan influence. In both of these stages the Nakshatras or lunar stations are discarded, but in the earliest of the two they appear as Rudras or Stations (their father is Sth\u0101nu, a place); but instead of being twenty-seven, only nine or one-third of them are reckoned. After deducting these nine Rudras from the twenty-eight gods, consisting of the Moon and his twenty-seven wives, there still remain nineteen. These were made up out of the twelve Adityas, representing the twelve revolutions of the sun, and the seven Vasus, representing apparently the seven days of the week or half a Nakshatra. To the twenty-eight gods so obtained, the five original snake\n\n\\(^1\\) Alberuni's India, chap. lxii. p. 120, vol. ii. Sachau's translation gives two lists of names of snakes applied to the five planets. Takshaka, Karkota, whom I have shown to represent the Kauravya, Il\u0101patra, and Mah\u0101padma, which are the Tr\u0101vata snakes, appear in these lists, and the last in the list is Sankha, who is evidently the Sankara or \u015aiva of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. For further information as to the original thirty-three gods, their several functions and the divisions into which the gods regulating the course of the year were grouped, see Appendix B. Ludwig is quoted by Zimmer, Altindische Leben, p. 354, as adopting this division of the thirty-three gods, but he did not apparently pursue the subject any further than to suggest this as a probable explanation of the difficulty in accounting for the number thirty-three.\ngods or planets were added, to make up the thirty-three. Under this arrangement the sun, moon, and stars all took their place in the calendar. When the worship of the moon and stars was eliminated, and sun-worship became predominant, it was still considered necessary to retain the old number of thirty-three gods, but this could not be done without repetition, and without destroying the value of the calendar as a compendium of astronomical information. The twelve \u0100dityas which represented the passage of the sun through the signs of the zodiac were still retained, but this sun was the old sun common to the former system, and to make the calendar entirely solar and Aryan, the new Aryan sun god and his stations must be included. So the Brahmins added to the Vasus the great sun god as the eighth Vasu, and made eleven Rudras to make up with himself the number of his twelve stations. This made thirty-one gods, and to make up the thirty-three, Praj\u0101pati, the son of Manu, and Vashatk\u0101ra were added.\n\nThe Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata proves clearly that the addition of the two Rudras was made by Brahmins, who were entirely ignorant of their original significance, as the tenth Rudra is Sth\u0101nu, who was their father, and originally showed that the Rudra represented Sth\u0101nu or Stations, and Bharga, which was the Brahminical name for the Bh\u0101ratas.\n\nThe proof of the addition of the eighth Vasu to the original seven is more complicated, but it gives a most interesting insight into the methods by which sun-worship was introduced into the country.\n\nIn the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata the eight Vasus are said to be the sons of the river Gang\u0101, and \u015aantana the Kauravya king. They were condemned to be born among men, because at the instigation of Dy\u016b, who was one of the eight, they had stolen the sacred cow of Vasishtha for the daughter of U\u015binara, king of the Eastern Bhojas or \u015aivas.\n\n1 Prajapati means the lord of creatures, and in Monier-Williams's Sanskrit Dictionary Vashatk\u0101ra is interpreted to mean \"he who makes a burnt offering with the formula Vashat, meaning may the god of fire bear it to the gods.\" See Appendix B, where I have shown, on the authority of the Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, that Vashatk\u0101ra means the maker of the six seasons.\n\n2 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, lxvi. p. 183.\n\n3 \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, xcix. pp. 295\u2013297.\ncursed them for the theft, and condemned them to be born on the earth, but allowed the less guilty seven to return to heaven before the end of a year. He decreed that Dy\u016b, who was the real author of the theft, was to remain on earth for a long time. In accordance with this sentence, Ganga threw her seven first-born sons into the river as soon as they were born, but brought up the eighth, Dy\u016b, who became known on earth as the Kauravya hero Bhishma. Now these seven Vasu, who were thrown into the river as soon as they were born, are clearly the seven days which formed one-half of the lunar Nakshatra, each of which disappears as soon as it is completely born, but the eighth is the specially bright being, Dy\u016b, the sun, who does not wax, wane or disappear, but always remains undimmed by time or seasonal changes. It is the Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitra, the sun or friend of all beings.\u00b9\n\nThe correctness of this identification of Dy\u016b with Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitra is shown by the story of the theft of the cows, which is exactly the same as the later legend, in which the cows are stolen by Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitra and not by Dy\u016b. After Dy\u016b became Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitra, the original meaning of the sun-god was gradually lost, and Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitra became the son of G\u0101dhi,\u00b2 and prince of the Ku\u015bikas.\n\nStill further proof that it was Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitra who was the eighth Vasu is given in the legend of G\u0101lava, which also illustrates the descent of the Eastern tribes. It appears in various forms in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, but the fullest is the somewhat late version of it given in the Udyoga Parva.\u00b3 It tells how Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitra asked G\u0101lava to give him as his fee for teaching him eight hundred horses as white as the moon. G\u0101lava went to Yay\u0101ti to beg the horses, but Yay\u0101ti would\n\n\u00b9 Rigv. x. 72. 8 and 9 gives a precisely similar account of the fate of the eight sons of \u0100diti, to that given in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata of the eight sons of Gunga. In the verses quoted \u0100diti has eight sons (\u0101dityas); she sends back seven immediately to the gods. The eighth she calls continually to be born, and sends him away to die. The eighth son is here called the son of the egg, and means, as the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata proves Aruna, the charioteer of the sun, and god of the firestick (ara\u1e47i). Aruna is said to be born out of an egg, with the upper part of his body developed, but the lower part undeveloped. He is thus the counterpart of the son of the egg in the Rigveda, who revives in the morning and dies at night.\u2014\u0100di (Astika) Parva, xvi. and xxiv. pp. 77 and 91.\n\n\u00b2 Mauu, vii. 42.\n\n\u00b3 Udyoga (Bhagavatyana) Parva, cv.-cxxii.\nnot give them to him: but he gave him his daughter M\u0101dhav\u012b instead. She possessed the power of recovering her virginity even after the birth of a son. G\u0101lava took her successively to Haria\u00e7va, the Ikshv\u0101ku king of Ayodhya, Divodasa, king of K\u0101si, and U\u1e63inara, king of the Bhojas, each of whom gave him two hundred horses, such as he required for the privilege of raising up an heir from M\u0101dhav\u012b. Vasumanas was her son by Haria\u00e7va, Pratardhana by Divodasa, and \u015aiva by U\u1e63inara. G\u0101lava then took the six hundred horses to Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitra, who accepted M\u0101dhav\u012b for the remainder of his fee, and became by her the father of Ash\u1e6daka. Now Ash\u1e6daka means the son of the eighth, that is, of the eighth Vasu, the sun, and this confirms the evidence given by the legends previously cited as showing that Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitra was the eighth Vasu.\n\nBut these stories show also that it was Dy\u016b, Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitra, or the eighth Vasu, which gave the sacred cow to the daughter of U\u1e63inara, the Eastern Bhoja, that is, to the non-Aryan races. In other words, the non-Aryan races were converted to be sun-worshippers, and adorers, not of seven Vasus, like their forefathers, the worshippers of the Moon, but of the eighth and brightest Vasu, the Sun. This change was the result of Brahmin teaching.\n\nFurther evidence of the introduction of sun-worship among the aboriginal tribes is given in the account of the snake sacrifice in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata.\u00b9 In this story Vinat\u0101 and Kadru were two sisters. Vinat\u0101 was the mother of the bird Ga\u1e47\u1e0dura (later Garu\u1e0da, the sacred bird of Vishnu), the eater of snakes, and Aru\u1e47a is the charioteer of the sun, who stays in front of him and prevents him from burning the world.\u00b2 In other words, he is the Ara\u1e47i, the sacred fire-stick, or \u201cSwastika,\u201d used to produce the sacred fire by friction. Kadru, Vinat\u0101\u2019s sister, was the mother of the thousand snakes. Aruna cursed his mother because she broke the egg containing him before he was fully developed, and she and Ga\u1e47\u1e0dura were accordingly made slaves to Kadru and her sons. They made Ga\u1e47\u1e0dura bear them on his back to\n\n\u00b9 \u0100di (Astika) Parva, xvi.-xxxiv. pp. 76-113.\n\u00b2 \u0100di (Astika) Parva, xxiv. p. 91.\nIndia. While carrying them he went too near the sun, which scorched the snakes, and they were saved by Indra at the intercession of Kadru. Indra, as the rain-god, covered the sun with clouds, which protected the snakes from the heat of its rays. Ga\u1e0dura first brought them into the Malayan country to the south, and from thence he took them to the Nishada country in the north, which they found full of Nishadas and Brahmins. The snakes promised Ga\u1e0dura to free him and his mother if he would bring them Soma, or Amrita, the drink of immortality. He promised to do so, but before he started to fetch the Amrita, he had seized the elephant (Ir\u0101vata) and the tortoise (K\u016brma), and had tried to eat them on the branch of a \"bur,\" or banyan-tree, on which the Valakhilya Rishis (belonging to the Kanva Brahmins) were suspended. The branch of the tree broke, and to save the Rishis from destruction, he took the elephant, tortoise, and the broken branch to the Himalayas, where he placed the broken branch on the mountains, and devoured the elephant and the tortoise. After a contest with the gods, he stole the Amrita and brought it to the snakes, placing it on some Kusa, or sacred grass. The snakes then freed Ga\u1e0dura, but left the Amrita unguarded, and Indra recovered it while Ga\u1e0dura devoured the snakes.\n\nThis legend sets forth in a mythical form the process of the destruction of snake-worship through the B\u0101ratas, or sons of the Bur tree, and the Brahmins, and traces how far the influence of the doctrines of sun-worship extended. The first race to be hindooized were the Ir\u0101vata, or elephant race, and the next the K\u016brma, or the people of the tortoise. These latter are the K\u016brs, K\u016brmis, Kaurs or Kurus, and the tortoise is still found as a totem among the Kurmis of Bengal,\n\n1 Does not this legend point to an immigration of the snake-worshipping tribes by sea? the bird Ga\u1e0dura representing the ships; or may he not be the divine storm bird, Lugal-tudda, of Assyrian mythology; he being the monsoon or storm wind which brought the snake races from the west to India? Commerce by sea dates from a very early period, and it is possible that some of the immigrants may have come by sea. Andhra coins are found bearing the image of a ship. For the storm bird see Sayce's Hibbert Lectures for 1887, pp. 293-296.\n\n2 See above, p. 253, for the story of how Ga\u1e0dura devoured the Brahmin and his Nishada wife.\nthe Kumhars, or potters of Orissa, and the Koras; tribes which still show in their names their descent from the great race of the K\u016brs.\n\nThe process of conversion ceased when Ga\u1e0dura, the B\u0101ratas, and their attendant Rishis had reached the limits of the Kauravya rule, and come to the country of the Takkas. In a subsequent and later section of the story, after that of Ga\u1e0dura, Takshaka, the snake god of the Takkas, betook himself to the protection of Indra, when he was to be burnt by the Brahmins for killing Parikshit, father of Janamejaya, but even in Indra\u2019s heaven he could not be saved from the effects of the Brahmin Mantras. He was just falling into the fire when he was saved by the intercession of Astika, the son of the Rishi Jaratkara, and Jaratkara of the same name, sister of V\u0101suki. Here in Astika we have another appearance of the eighth Vasu, and we learn that though the Ir\u0101vata and Kauravya became hindooized, the Takkas obstinately refused to forsake the worship of their ancestral gods. The truth of this deduction is confirmed by the fact that snake-worship continued to be the dominant religion in Kashmir and the countries dependent on it to a very late period. Buddhist legends are full of accounts of the N\u0101gas who dwelt in this region, and Hiouen Tsiang speaks of the great shrine of Il\u0101patra close to Takkasil\u0101.\n\nWhen we leave legend and turn to the Rigveda and the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, we find the above conclusions as to the way in which the gradual modification of the indigenous religions was effected completely confirmed. In the sixth Mandala of the Rigveda, which is said to be written by the Bh\u0101radv\u0101jas, who were the special priests of the Bh\u0101ratas, we find the Bh\u0101rata Agni praised as the slayer of demons. I have already called attention to the \u0100nava Agni. But the best evidence as to the full force of the expression is to be found in\n\n1 Primitive Marriage in Bengal, by H. Risley, Asiatic Quart. Review, April, 1886.\n2 Adi (Astika) Parva, xl. to lviii. pp. 121-160.\n3 Adi (Astika) Parva, liii. p. 149 and 150.\n4 From this explanation of the true meaning of Astika and Ashtaka it is clear that Hastinapur or Hastinagur does not mean the eight cities, but the city of the eighth Vasu, the Sun.\n5 Rigv. vi. 16. 19 and 45.\n6 Rigv. viii. 74. 4.\nconnexion with the Agni lighted for the S\u1e5b\u1e47jaya before the son of Devavata.\\(^1\\) The fourth Mandala of the Rigveda, in which this hymn is found, is said to have been written by the Gotama Brahmans. These Gotanas have a special connection with the B\u0101ratas and other indigenous races. It was Gotama R\u0101h\u012b\u1e45gana who accompanied M\u0101thava, the Videgha, when they followed the Agni Vai\u015bv\u0101nara, which went burning before them to the river Sand\u0101nir\u0101\\(^2\\) (the Gunduk).\\(^3\\) Kripa, the grandson of Gautama, and Drona, the son of Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja, were the tutors of the young Kauravas and P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, and apparently the only Brahmans at the court of the Kauravya king.\\(^4\\) It was another Gautama, called Chandri-K\u016b\u1e63ika, or the moon of the K\u016b\u1e63ikas, who, as we have seen, procured the birth of Jarasandha, king of Magadha.\\(^5\\)\n\nThe lighting of the sacred fire for the S\u1e5b\u1e47jaya, which is described in the Gotana Mandala of the Rigveda, must be either the same or a similar event to that related in the Satapatha-Brahmana.\\(^6\\) There Suplan S\u0101rujaya, Suplan the S\u1e5b\u1e47jaya, is said to have learnt the D\u0101ksh\u0101yana, or new moon sacrifice, which is also called the Vashistha sacrifice, from Prat\u012bdar\u1e63a \u015avaikna. After he had learnt both this and Sautr\u0101mani sacrifice, he went back to the S\u1e5b\u1e47jayas, who called him henceforth not Suplan, but Sahadeva Sarnjaya, because he had come back with the gods (sahadera). Here the D\u0101ksh\u0101yana sacrifice is, as I have shown in Appendix B, probably identical with the D\u012bk\u1e63an\u012by\u0101 or sacrifice of initiation, which I fully described in my former paper. I there said that it probably was the ceremony by which non-Aryans were received into the Aryan community, and transferred by this new symbolical birth from the rank of Sudras to the higher status of those who are twice-born (dvija). These instances and the legends I have\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Rigv. iv. 15. 4.\n\n\\(^2\\) Satapatha Brahmana, 4. 1. 13; Eggeling\u2019s translation, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xii. p. 105.\n\n\\(^3\\) Or perhaps rather the Chota Gunduk.

That this was accomplished by peaceful conversion, and not by warlike conquest, is shown by the legend of M\u0101thava the Videgha, who, with Gotama R\u0101h\u016bgana, followed the sacred fire which went burning before them.\n\nThe diffusion of the Aryan doctrines in the country east of the Jumna seems to have been chiefly done through the help of the K\u016bsika or Panch\u0101la kings, and hence it is that the mythical Visv\u0101mitra is said to be the son of G\u0101dhi or Gandh\u0101ra, and to belong to the K\u016bsika tribe.\n\nThe process of conversion seems to have been generally that set forth in the legend of the conquest of the Haihayas by the Bhrigus. The Brahmin ascetics first entered the country, gained a reputation for sanctity, established schools or secured the direction of the training of the children, which was carefully attended to in all Dravidian states. They were accompanied or followed by the arianized cattle-herdsmen, who sought pasture for their cattle, and gradually settled in the new country. As the immigrants multiplied, they gradually became more powerful, and gradually ousted the native rulers and placed the government in the hands of those of more pronounced Aryan views. But this gradual colonization was only possible in thinly-peopled districts. In a country so rich and flourishing as the more fertile and open parts of India must have been when foreign trade was so active as I have shown it to be, there could have been little room for new comers, and the Aryans could only gain influence by diplomatic means, and by the military and political reputation they had established for themselves in their conduct of the wars of Divodasa and his son Sudas. In the comparatively sparsely populated districts of the hill country of Rajputana they could increase and multiply, mould the Kolarian tribes to complete acquiescence in their teaching, and become the real rulers of the country. Hence it is in these countries, and among the Kolarian tribes of the West, that the doctrines of sun- and fire-worship struck the deepest roots. On the other hand, in\nthe thickly-populated and strongly-governed kingdoms in the centre of the country, and especially among the Panch\u0101las, whose country was, as we have seen, called Ahikshetra or the field of snakes, the Aryan teachers found the material they had to deal with far less pliable. Hence, instead of finding the worship of the black sun-god Krishna the national religion, as they had done in the West, they were obliged to content themselves by making the five snake gods into the one god \u015aiva, or Mahadeva, and make him, and not the sun, the father of all beings. They were also obliged to bring in the Kolarian gods in the shape of Uma or Durga his wife, and in amalgamating the two they retained, though in a milder form, the doctrines of the two religions. They abolished as far as possible animal sacrifices, though they were obliged to superintend sacrifices such as the A\u015bvamedha, which was still retained, and quite put an end in the civilized part of the country to the human sacrifices which were common among the Kolarian and the less civilized Dravidian races. But it was not only in religious matters they made themselves a power in the land. The perfect organization, careful training, tact, and per-\n\n---\n\n1 See for the origin of the worship of Vishnu or Krishna and of \u015aiva, Appendix B, where Vishnu is shown to be the Semite-Accad sun god V\u0101suki, and \u015aiva the god of the earlier moon-worshipping races descended from the snake god Ea.\n\n2 Vana (Kan\u0101ta) Parva, xxxix. pp. 121-126. In this account of the appearance of Saukara or Mahadeva and his wife Uma to Arjuna, they both assumed the forms of Kir\u0101tas or Kolarians.\n\n3 Alberuni shows that in the later form of the sacrifice the horse was no longer killed. In describing it he says: \"A mare is let to wander freely about in the country grazing, without anybody's hindering her. Soldiers follow her, drive her, and cry out before her, 'She is the king of the world. He who does not agree let him come forward.' The Brahmins walk behind her, and her form sacrifices to the fire where she casts her dung. When she has thus wandered through all parts of the world, she becomes food for the Brahmins and for him whose property she is.\"\u2014Alberuni's India, Sachau's edition, vol. ii. ch. lxv. p. 139. This form of sacrifice is similar to that of the Brahmini bull.\n\n4 We find two instances of human sacrifices in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, the first, \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, xcv. p. 283, where king Ayuta-Nayi performed a sacrifice in which the fat of an Ayuta of male beings was required, and the other in the story of Jarasandha, where he is accused by Krishna of seeking to perform a sacrifice to Sankara by slaughtering human beings, and of keeping captive beings to sacrifice to him. Sahha (Jarasaudha-badha) Parva, xxii. p. 68. Human sacrifice still continually occurs in remote tracts. I have known of three cases which have occurred in the last twenty years in the Chota Nagpore country. This constant recurrence to the old practice and the organized system of Mereahs or boys brought up for the purpose among the Khonds of Orissa, which was put a stop to only about thirty-five years ago proves the general prevalence of the custom in ancient times.\nseverance of the Brahmins made them the most trusted counsellors of kings, while the Aryan youths, who did not belong to the families included in the Brahmin political and religious organization made the best of soldiers. The Aryans, when once they had established their position as competitors for power in the great battle of the ten kings, continued to move steadily and perseveringly on to the complete moral conquest of the country. By their alliances with the B\u0101ratas and trading races they made their language the common language of the country, and the Brahmin missionaries, who were the principal teachers of the young, diffused the use of it everywhere. Marriages with Aryans were eagerly sought after, and all were anxious to put themselves under the rule of sovereigns who had been trained by Aryan methods, and who were guided by the counsels of wise Aryan ministers. It was by these means that a people who were few in numbers compared with the many million inhabitants of the country who belonged to other races became the real rulers of its kingdoms, the teachers of its religion, the preceptors of its youth, and the leaders in philosophy and learning.\n\nIt was under Aryan guidance that the Surasena kings of Panch\u0101la, after the close of the great war of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, maintained supreme control over the Kuru, Panch\u0101la, Chedi, Avanti, and Surasena countries, and we find in the \u015aatapatha-Br\u0101hma\u1e47a that there was one Purohita Dcvabh\u0101ga-\u015arau-tarsha for the Kuru-Panch\u0101la kingdoms.\u00b9 It was under their guidance that the western tribes extended their power eastward, that the Ikshv\u0101ku confederacy of Kuntibhojas or \u015aakas and Suvar\u1e47a first occupied K\u014dsambi, extended their rule into Bengal, and afterwards established the great Ikshv\u0101ku-Sakya kingdom of S\u0101keta in Oude, which took its name from its Scythian founders. It was the Aryan Brahmins who led the further advance into the countries to the east of the Gunduk, and who superintended the establishment of the kingdom of Videha and the founding of the great city of the Vaisyas, or V\u0101syus, which became so celebrated\n\n\u00b9 \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, ii. 4. 4. 5; Prof. Eggeling's translation, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xii. p. 377.\nunder the name of Vais\u0101li. And the great intellectual activity which made Ko\u1e63\u0101mbi and Vais\u0101li the centres of religious and philosophical speculation was entirely due to the influence and the teachings of the Brahmins. It was they who were the authors of the \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, the sacrificial manual of the Eastern countries, and of the Upanishads, and it was from their teachings that the great religious apostles of the east and west, Gautama the Buddha, and Mahav\u012bra the Jain, together with the predecessors of both teachers, evolved the doctrines which distinguished these sects.\n\nTherefore, though the sketch of the history and of the ethnology of Northern India which I have attempted in this and my previous paper differs exceedingly from that which has been hitherto held to be the orthodox view, yet it rather enhances than detracts from the merits of the Aryan race. It was a far more difficult task for a small tribe to enter upon a thickly-peopled and strongly-governed country, and to make themselves masters of its destinies by comparatively peaceful means, than to come, as has been hitherto supposed the Aryans did, into one which was nearly uncultivated and inhabited by savage races, and to gradually increase and multiply in it, driving back, as they advance, the savages into the hills. If the views I advocate, and which I hope I have adequately proved by citations from original authorities, are accepted as correct, inquirers into the facts of Indian history will no longer be confronted with the difficulties arising from the fact that in a country supposed to be peopled by Aryans most of the people belong to totally different races, nor will they find it hard to explain how the country, which was supposed to be governed by one race, has been from time immemorial divided into a number of separate kingdoms. Besides removing these difficulties, and tracing the progress made by the chief ruling races in conquering and civilizing the country, I have shown how the imperial-federal government, which was that under which India prospered in its best days, took its rise, and the great part played in Indian history by the foreign trade.\nAPPENDIX A.\n\nGenealogies of the Purus and Kurus, as given in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and Rigveda, beginning at Puru.\n\nI.\n\nGenealogy given in \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, Sect. xciv.\n\n1.

This reference has, I am glad to say, enabled me to deal with the whole subject much more clearly and fully than I was able to do at first.\n\nIn the first place, Dr. Muir quotes a passage from the Rigveda (i. 133. 6) where the Rudras or Maruts are said to be twenty-seven in number,\\(^1\\) thus making them identical with the Nakshatras. They are said to be begotten by Rudra upon Pr\u012b\u1e63\u1e47i, the earth, thus showing their earth-born origin and their connection with the worshippers of the earth. Secondly, in the eight passages from the Rigveda which Dr. Muir cites as speaking of thirty-three gods,\\(^2\\) four (Rigv. i. 34. 11; Rigv. i. 139. 11; Rigv. viii. 35. 3; Rigv. ix. 92. 4) speak of them as being thrice eleven in number. There is evidently a significance in this division into groups of eleven, as a passage of the Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a,\\(^3\\) quoted by Dr. Muir in a foot-note, in speaking of the thirty-three gods, divides them into two groups of thirty-three each, there being thirty-three gods who drink Soma, and thirty-three who do not drink it. It then goes on to say, \"The Soma-drinking gods are eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve \u0100di-tyas, Pr\u0101japati, Vashatk\u0101ra. The gods who do not drink Soma are eleven Pray\u0101jas, eleven Anuy\u0101jas, and eleven Upay\u0101jas.\" Now these gods who do not drink Soma, the drink of the Aryan gods, clearly belong to another religious system. In the explanation given by Dr. Haug\\(^4\\) in his\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Muir's Sanskrit Texts, vol. v. sect. ix. p. 147.\n\n\\(^2\\) Nakshatras probably mean Nag-k\u1e63ketras or stations of the Nag or Snake. Nag-k\u1e63etra, meaning field of the Nag or great snake, would be formed just in the same way as Ahi-k\u1e63etra and Kuruk\u1e63etra, p. 218.\n\n\\(^3\\) Muir's Sanskrit Texts, vol. v. sect. i. pp. 9-11.\n\n\\(^4\\) Ait. Br\u0101hm\u0101\u1e47a, Haug's translation, vol. ii. p. 110.\nnotes on these last three divisions, he shows that the Pray\u0101jas mean the eleven verses which always make up the \u0100pri or sacrificial hymns. The Unuy\u0101jas are the deities who appear at the animal sacrifices, which are essentially non-Aryan observances, and the Apaj\u0101yas mean the supplementary offerings. Among the Anuy\u0101ja deities are \u1e5a\u1e63a, Sarasvat\u012b, and Bh\u0101rata, whom I have already shown to be the representatives of the three great ruling races of India. The explanation of Sayana, quoted by Muir, that the thrice eleven gods of the earth, air, and heaven, are really three, but are called thirty-three on account of their many manifestations, does not make matters at all more clear. The division of the gods into groups of eleven is certainly not maintained in the orthodox lists of the thirty-three gods used by the Aryan Brahmans, and its adoption in the rites of sacrifices which do not belong to the original ritual of the fire-worshippers, points, like the reference to Soma, to its derivation from earlier rites paid to gods who were essentially different from the Solar deities. The totally unpractical character of the explanation of the number thirty-three given by Brahmin expounders shows they did not understand the facts they were trying to explain.\n\nI have already spoken of the differences that are found in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata as to the number of Rudras, where in some passages they are said to number eleven, and in another nine, while there is a third statement in the Rigveda, as I have shown above, which makes them to be twenty-seven. There is a similar difference in the names of the two deities who are added to the eleven Rudras, eight Vasus, and twelve \u0100dityas, to make up the number of thirty-three gods in the orthodox lists. In the Satapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a,\u00b9 Dyaus and Prithi (heaven and earth) take the places assigned to Pr\u0101japati and Vashatk\u0101ra in the earlier lists in the Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, and Pr\u0101japati is said to be a thirty-fourth god. All these indications show that there was uncertainty as to the numbers of the several gods to be\n\n\u00b9 Satapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, iv. 5. 7. 2; Sacred Books of the East, Prof. Eggeling\u2019s translation, vol. xxvi. p. 411.\nincluded in the list, that the Brahmin ritualists were groping about blindly to explain what they did not understand, and the only stable element seems to be that the thirty-three gods were composed of groups in which divisions into eleven and nine had a principal share.\n\nIt is in the Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a that we find an indication of the solution of the puzzle.\\(^1\\) Vashatk\u0101ra is explained to be \"he who makes the six seasons and establishes them.\" This gives at once an intelligible explanation of the number thirty-three, for we have the twenty-seven Rudras or Nakshatras, and the six seasons, as the gods who rule the seasonal changes and the movements of the heavenly bodies which affect the earth and its inhabitants, and who are the six N\u0101gas or snake-gods, the recurring manifestations of the creative vital power, the active principle which animated the earth, the centre of all nature, and enabled it to become the father and mother of all things created, whether in heaven or on earth. The Sanskrit astronomers give us the further clue necessary to complete the explanation. Alberuni (Abu Rihan), quoting Var\u0101hamihira,\\(^2\\) says: \"He defines the six parts of the year in the following manner: The first, beginning with the winter solstice, belongs to Saturn, the second to Venus, the third to Mars, the fourth to the moon, the fifth to Mercury, the sixth to Jupiter.\" In the next page but one Alberuni says: \"The Hindus have still another custom, viz. that of mentioning together with the dominant of the year one of the N\u0101gas or serpents, which have certain names as they are used in connection with one or other of the planets,\" and he gives the two following lists of the names of these serpents with the planets with which they are connected:\n\n| Name of Planet | Name of Serpent | Name of Serpent |\n|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| 1. Saturn     | Cakshabhadra or Sankha. |\n| 2. Venus      | Karkotaka.       | Mah\u0101padma.      |\n| 3. Mars       | Pushkara Bhrama. | Takshaka.       |\n| 4. The Moon   | Pushkara.        | Chitrangada.    |\n| 5. Mercury    | \u00c7abrahasta.      | Karkota.        |\n| 6. Jupiter    | El\u0101patra.        | Padma.          |\n\n\\(^1\\) Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, iii. 6, Haug's translation, vol. ii. p. 167.\n\\(^2\\) Alberuni's India, Sachau's translation, vol. ii. chap. lxii. pp. 118-120\nAccording to this information the six seasons are represented by the moon and five planets, called after names given to the N\u0101gas or snake-gods. But this does not yet explain the division of these thirty-three gods, consisting of the twenty-seven Nakshatras and the dominants of the six seasons into groups of eleven. It is clear from another statement of Alberuni\\(^1\\) that this is connected with the division of the year into three seasons instead of six. After saying that the Hindus divide the year into six parts, and call these six parts \"ritu,\" each \"ritu\" comprehending two solar months, he goes on to say: \"I have been told that in the region of Soman\u0101th (that is, in the Saurashtra country), people divide the year into three parts, each part consisting of four months, the first being Varshak\u0101la (i.e. the rainy season), the second \u015aitak\u0101la, the winter, and the third Ashnak\u0101la, the summer.\" This is the division which is still observed throughout Northern India, and is that known to the authors of the Rigveda, who, as Zimmer shows, reckoned three seasons Hima (winter), Sama (summer), and Sarad (the rainy season).\\(^2\\) This will at once give the reason for the ancient division of the thirty-three gods into three groups of eleven each. Each group must have consisted of nine Nakshatras with two dominant planets as representing one of the seasons. Thus the dominants of the winter season, beginning with the winter solstice, which was the original New Year's day,\\(^3\\) were the planets Saturn and Venus, called after the snakes Sankha and Mah\u0101padma, those of the summer were Mars and the Moon, called after the snakes Takshaka and \u010citrangada, and those of the rainy season Mercury and Jupiter, called after the snakes Karko\u1e6da and Padma.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Alberuni's India, vol. i. chap. xxxvii. p. 357.\n\n\\(^2\\) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, pp. 371-373.\n\n\\(^3\\) The year among the Dravidian Tamils of Southern India still begins at the winter solstice. There the chief annual festival is the Pongol, which \"marks the commencement of the Tamil year.\"\u2014Monier Williams, Religious Thought and Life in India, chap. xvi. p. 429. The Abb\u00e9 Dubois, a Roman Catholic Missionary, who spent many years in Southern India, and lived in most intimate communion with the natives, in his work Sur les M\u0153urs, Institutions et Ceremonies des peuples de l'Inde, published in 1825, vol. ii. part iii. Religion, chap. iii. p. 354, says: \"The Pongol festival is the most sacred of all feasts in Southern India, it is presided over by \u015aiva.\" This agrees with my suggestion that he is the dominant god of the lunar year and of the winter solstice, when, as Abb\u00e9 Dubois says, the festival begins (on the entrance of the Sun into Capricornus, the sign of the goat).\nThat this was the original arrangement of the functions of the thirty-three gods may be further proved from the Rigveda. In the only passage where the Nakshatras are mentioned, Rigv. x. 85, 2, it is said, \"Through Soma\\(^1\\) (the moon) the Aditya are strong, through Soma the earth is vast, therefore is the moon placed in the centre of the Nakshatras.\" This evidently refers to the division of the year which begins with the winter solstice under the influence of Sankha, i.e. Sankhara or Siva, who continued to be the principal god of the older snake races, or moon worshippers. Under this system the moon dominates the summer solstice or the centre of the year.\n\nTo the evidence I have already adduced in the text to prove that his subsequent revisions of the original Lunar calendar took place in India may be added that derived from the statements made in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata as to the descendants of the thirteen daughters of Daksha, who were married to K\u0101\u015byapa, the father of men.\\(^2\\) They, as I have shown, represented the thirteen lunar months. \u0100diti, originally meaning \"the beginning,\" afterwards the sun, appears as one of these, as well as D\u0101nu and Kro\u1e0dh\u0101, the ancestresses of the Dravidian and Kolarian races. But this \u0100diti was not the same person as the Aryan sun god, for it is said in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata that \"the sun and moon of the celestials are other persons than those of the sons of D\u0101nu.\" This shows that there was a solar revision of the calendar made by the Dravidian races upon the introduction of the method of reckoning the divisions of time by the passage of the sun on its way round the central earth through the Zodiacal circle. This revision made the Rudras or stations of the moon nine instead of twenty-seven, and instead of reckoning only six dominant gods, as in the Lunar calendar, the sun was added to the six under the name of Suka, or V\u0101suki, or\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Soma is used to mean both the moon and strong drink. It probably meant first intoxicating drinks, which is the meaning it most frequently has in the Rigveda. These were regarded as the means of procuring the inspiration of the vital creative power which was the father and mother of all things. Hence the reverence always paid to lunatics in the East. The moon as the great author and most constant evidence of the heavenly vital changes regulating the times and seasons of the earth was called by the name of Soma the inspirer. It was from the connection between drinking strong drink and moon worship which led the Vishnuites, who were the opponents of the older snake and moon worshippers, to be advocates of total abstinence from intoxicating drinks, see p. 278.\n\n\\(^2\\) \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, lxv. pp. 185\u2013186.\nNanda (the bull). These became the seven days of the week, beginning with Sunday, sacred to the sun, followed by Monday, or the day of the moon Pushkara, or Chitrangada, and were the seven snakes or sons of D\u0101nu whom Indra slew. The days after Sunday and Monday represented the five planets, and the arrangement corresponded exactly with that adopted by all the nations who, like the ancient inhabitants of India, derived their calendar from Babylon. To these sixteen gods were added the twelve \u0100dityas, or solar months, to complete the lists of the gods who directly ruled the times and seasons. The nine Rudras represented the triple division of the seasons, the seven snake-gods the days of the week, and the \u0100dityas the months. The supreme power in the hierarchy was as before vested in the five great snake-gods, the fathers and gods of the five snake races, who also rule the planets, and who, with the twenty-eight gods of the new solar calendar, made up the number of thirty-three gods. But in this revised calendar the moon god still retained the prominent position he had held in the old lunar year, for it still was the central point of the system, though it no longer ruled the summer solstice. The new solar year began with the vernal equinox and the seventh month of K\u0101rtik, that in which the sun enters Libra, was sacred to the moon, and it is on the appearance of the new moon of K\u0101rtik that the Dewali (D\u012bb\u0101li), which is the greatest religious festival of Western India, takes place.\n\nBut this old solar calendar, which shows that there were sun-worshippers in India before the Aryans preached that distinctive creed, also serves to throw great light on the origin of popular Indian theology. I have shown the prominent place held by \u015aa\u1e45kha, \u015aa\u1e45khara or \u015aiva in the old lunar year, which began under his auspices. Similarly the solar year, beginning at the vernal equinox when the sun entered the constellation of Nanda, i.e. Taurus the bull, was under the protection of Suka or V\u0101suki, the god riding on Nanda the bull. The moon, which rules the middle of the\n\n1 Alberuni's India, Sachau's translation, vol. ii. chap. lxi. p. 120.\n2 Rigv. x. 120. 6; Muir's Sanskrit Texts, vol. v. p. 95.\n3 Alberuni's India, Sachau's translation, vol. ii. chap. lxxvi. p. 182.\nyear in both systems, is the central ruler of both. Its religious significance is best shown by the name Pushkara. Pushkara near Ajmir, the shrine of the Moon Pushkara or the unfading lotus, is still, as it was in the days when the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata was written, the most sacred of all Hindu shrines, and the man \"who goes there in the full moon of the month K\u0101rtika acquires everlasting life in the abode of Brahma.\"\u00b9\n\nIt is the one temple in India where there is no image, and where the deity is adored as Brahma or Barhma, the mighty being, the god of all gods. These are the three gods of the popular triad. Pushkara or Brahma is the one great god ruling both the lunar and solar systems, and therefore the one god to be worshipped as the creator and ruler of time and of the events which it brings to pass. V\u0101suki, the chief of the solar-lunar year, I have already shown in the text\u00b2 to be the same as Krish\u1e47a, the son of the black races, and he is therefore the same god as Vish\u1e47u, who is always considered as identical with Krish\u1e47a, but whose worship began as that of the sun-god of the Suvar\u1e47a or Semite-Aeacid immigrants who settled in P\u0101t\u0101la, and brought with them into India the solar-lunar worship of the Assyrian nations. To these is to be added \u015aankhara or \u015aiva, the head of the Nakshatras, Rudras or Lunar mansions, and the ruler of the Lunar year. He still remains, as I have shown in the text, the chief god of the Lunar races, while V\u0101suki, Krish\u1e47a or Vish\u1e47u was the god worshipped by the united tribes of the Ikshv\u0101ku race of Suvar\u1e47a-Bhojas, who spread themselves eastward over India from P\u0101t\u0101la. The last revision made by the Aryan Brahmins has been already sufficiently dealt with in the text, but to complete the historical evidence to be drawn from these successive changes, it is necessary to consider that afforded by the researches of scholars who have interpreted the records of the Aeacids, or rather of their successors the Aeacid-Semites. Dr. Sayce, in his Hibbert Lectures for 1887, has shown that Sin, the moon-god, was father of the later sun-god Samas.\u00b3 The great antiquity of moon worship is shown by the fact that\n\n\u00b9 Vana (Tirtha-Yatra) Parva, lxxii. pp. 241-2.\n\u00b2 p. 243.\n\u00b3 Sayce's Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 193.\nSargon, the conqueror of Cyprus, whom he proves to have lived about 3750 B.C., was a sun-worshipper, but the sun-god he worshipped was not the older sun-god of Larsa, but the later sun-god of Sippara (Sepharvarum). Sargon moreover speaks of \"the remote days of the period of the moon-god.\" This remark clearly refers to the time when the Lunar calendar was in use, and this must have been discontinued long before the time of Sargon. This evidence is confirmed by that relating to the inventor of the Zodiacial circle. The adoption of the mode of reckoning time by the Zodiac must have been contemporary with the introduction of sun worship, as the gods of the great race who ruled the valley of the Euphrates were those who ruled the times and the seasons. That the Assyrian Zodiacial year began when the equinox occurred during the sun's passage through Taurus the bull is proved by incontestable evidence, and this system of measuring time must therefore have been introduced during the interval between the year 2500 B.C., when the equinox first happened, when the sun was in Aries (the Ram), and that of 4700 B.C., when it first took place, when the sun was in Taurus (the Bull).\n\nLong before the time Sargon first fixed his capital at Sippara, Ur-Bagas, the first known king of the united empire of Babylonia ruled by the Accad-Semites, built and endowed the temple of Sin (the moon) at Ur, or Mugheir, and the temple of the sun at Larsa. Judging from these and other indications of the actual date of the introduction of the zodiacal reckoning, Dr. Sayce fixes it somewhere near 4700 B.C., or about 1000 years before the time of Sargon.\n\nThe Indian, when compared with the Assyrian evidence, appears to me to prove incontestably that the Lunar calendar must have been introduced into India by immigrants from Assyria, and this could only have been done while time was reckoned in Assyria by Lunar periods. It must therefore\n\n---\n\n1 Ibid., pp. 167-8.\n2 Zodiac, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, pp. 791, 794; Sayce's Hibbert Lectures for 1887, pp. 397-8.\n3 Sayce's Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 167.\n4 Ibid., p. 398.\nhave come into India before the days when Ur-Bagas founded Ur, and when Eridu, the city sacred to the great Accad snake-god Ea,\\(^1\\) was one of the foremost cities of Babylonia and the chief port at the mouth of the Euphrates. It must have been from thence that the ancient Accad moon and snake worshippers traded with India on the one side and with the countries on the shores of the Red Sea and the Sinaitic peninsula on the other. An inscription on one of the statues found in the ruins of Telloh, a still older city than Eridu or Ur, says that the stone of which it was made (a hard diorite) was brought from Magan, the Land of Sinai, the mountain sacred to Sin, the moon. The art of these statues, together with the language and the inscriptions recorded on them, fully prove that they were executed in proto-Chaldaean times, before there were any Semites or sun-worshippers in the land. As for the date when the voyages to Sinai were made, it is approximately proved by one of the Telloh statues. This figure holds in its lap a plan of the city drawn to a scale which is marked on it.\\(^2\\) This standard of measurement is the same as that of the Egyptian pyramid builders, the kings of the fourth and two following dynasties. This will take us back to nearly 6000 B.C. The people who thus sailed westward along the coast through the Red Sea to Sinai must have been sufficiently adventurous to make the much shorter voyage to India, and the most convincing proof that they not only traded with India, but permanently settled there, is to be found in the fact that they made their calendar the first and earliest measure of Indian time. These people must have been the Australioid, or black-headed race of Sumir, of which Ea, the snake-god, was the reputed creator and ancestor,\\(^3\\) and the people whom Dr. Sayce, in another work,\\(^4\\) shows to have been the original inhabitants of the country at the mouth of the Indus, which they called Abhra, the Hebrew Ophir. These people spoke a Dravidian dialect\n\n\\(^1\\) Ibid., pp. 134, 135.\n\n\\(^2\\) Sayce's Hibbert Lectures for 1887, pp. 32-33.\n\n\\(^3\\) Ibid., p. 140.\n\n\\(^4\\) In an article on Ophir in the Queen's Printers' Aids to the Student of the Holy Bible.\nallied to the Tamil, which was probably similar to that now used by the Brahuis of the Bolan Pass,\u00b9 and were the early moon-worshippers known in India as the Ir\u0101vata, Haihaya or Gonds, who founded the earliest government and first established the internal and external trade of India. These people were followed by the Accad-Semite traders, who were known to the Sanskrit-speaking people by the name of Suvar\u1e47a, i.e. the people who belong to the race of Sus or Saos, who introduced the solar-lunar calendar, and were the worshippers of the god V\u0101su or V\u0101suki, who was the chief god of this pre-Aryan race of sun-worshippers.\n\nWith reference to the above explanations Prof. Weber's remark, quoted in page 247 of my paper, that Indian Astronomy should really be called Astrology, must be remembered; and when further we recollect the universal prevalence of Astrology throughout India as well as other Asiatic countries, and the influence always attributed by astrologers to the moon and the planets, we can see how these ideas must in all probability be derived from a system which made them the ruling powers of nature, the determinators of the times and the seasons; and the moon, which ruled the constant series of natural changes, the creator and regulator of this changing world and those who lived in it. If the solution of the difficulties of the question I have now proposed, both in this appendix and in the text of my paper, be accepted as correct, it is clear that long before the Vedic period the people of India worshipped the moon and the stars as the rulers of heaven and the earth under the symbol of the snake or phallus, as the creator and father and mother of all things. This creed was afterwards altered by the introduction of the\n\n\u00b9 Hunter's Gazetteer, vol. iii. p. 98, s.v. Brahui. The name Abhfra seems to be probably connected with the word ibha, 'an elephant,' which appears in the Hebrew word for the ivory brought by Solomon's ships, senhabbin, or the 'teeth of elephants,' habbin being ibha with the Hebrew plural termination. Ibha, though used in Sanskrit to denote elephants, is not an original Sanskrit word, elephants being called in the Rigveda mrga hastin, or 'the deer (mrga) with hands' (hastin), and is almost certainly a Dravidian word. Abhfra, or Ibhfra, would therefore appear to mean 'the land of the elephants,' and the people who lived in it were called by a Dravidian name which meant the elephant race, and which was the origin of the name of Ir\u0101vata, or the elephant race, which has been shown in p. 265 to be that of the Haihayas or Nahusha, the sons of the great serpent.\nSolar mode of reckoning time, and V\u0101suki or Vish\u1e47u became the Solar god of the black races, who were descended from the snake-gods of Assryia. The Aryan Brahmins who wrote the Vedic hymns, and their successors who wrote the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, in their anxiety to place the doctrines of the sun-worshippers on a popular basis, altered the old list of the gods so as to make their own Solar deities, who were different from those of the Semite-Accads, the only objects of worship; but in so doing they totally obscured the original meaning of the Assyrian calendar they thus distorted. They still, however, retained a distinct remembrance of the high position formerly held by the moon in the celestial hierarchy, and this and the survival of customs originated in the former religious systems of the country will account for the great stress they laid on the performance of the new and full moon sacrifices.\n\nThe next question which I have not fully cleared up in the text, and which I propose to discuss further in this appendix, is that connected with the Dikshiy\u0101na and D\u0101kshay\u0101na sacrifices. The Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a only mentions the first, which is the sacrifice of initiation, and distinctly connects it with the new and full moon oblations, which every Aryan was obliged to perform. It says, \u201cHe who has brought the new or full moon oblations may be inaugurated in consequence of the offering made at these oblations.\u201d And it goes on to say that he has thus \u201cmade a beginning with the sacrificial worship of the deities.\u201d\u00b9 It makes no limit whatever as to the classes of persons who may be initiated. It then goes on to give the description of the ceremony of initiation which I have already quoted in my previous paper, of which this is a continuation.\u00b2 The rules for the initiation ceremony begin with the words: \u201cThe priests make him whom they initiate by means of the Dik\u1e63\u0101 ceremony to be an embryo again,\u201d showing clearly that the ceremony typified a new birth. The \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, on the other hand, speaks of two sacrifices. First, the D\u0101kshay\u0101na sacrifice, which was a modification of the\n\n\u00b9 Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, i. 1, Haug\u2019s translation, vol. ii. p. 5.\n\u00b2 Journ. Roy. Asiat. Soc. Vol. XX. Part III. p. 349.\nnew and full moon sacrifices, which it says is peculiar to the sons of D\u0101ksha Parvati.\\(^1\\) Secondly, the Diksh\u0101 or consecration sacrifice, to which only Brahmans, R\u0101janya and Vai\u015bya, are eligible,\\(^2\\) and which has nothing to do with the new and full moon sacrifices beyond making the recipients of the consecration eligible to offer them. Now the sons of Daksha, to whom the first sacrifice belonged, and which was that which S\u0101pana S\u0101rnajaya learnt from Pratidar\u1e63a \u015avaikna, are shown by the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata to be the moon and snake worshippers or the Lunar races, as Daksha is the father of the twenty-seven Nak\u1e63atras, wives of the moon, and of the thirteen wives of K\u0101\u015byapa, which represent the thirteen lunar months, and also of Dan\u016b, the ancestress of the Asura or snake worshippers, and of Kro\u1e0dh\u0101, ancestress of the Kolarians.\\(^3\\)\n\nParvati means the god of the mountains (Parbut or Parbat, a mountain), and the two names Daksha Parvati imply the people of the lunar or snake races and the Kolarians or people of the mountains. The division of what was originally one sacrifice into two, one of which was peculiar to non-Aryans, and the other set apart for those who were already admitted to be of Aryan descent, was clearly made after the division of castes had been made. The D\u0101kshay\u0101na or later sacrifice was introduced to obviate the difficulties arising from the acknowledgment that S\u0101pana, a non-Aryan, and others like him, had received Aryan initiation by the Dikshay\u0101na sacrifice. In the earlier days of the Aryan propaganda all who were willing to believe and whom the priests chose to receive were admitted to Aryan privileges and made \"dwija\" or twice-born, without any distinction of races.

IV.\u2014The Northern Frontagers of China. Part VIII.\n\nThe Kirais and Prester John. By H. H. Howorth, Esq., M.P., M.R.A.S.\n\nBefore reporting the history of the Kirais in detail, so far as we can recover it, I will shortly dissect the story of Prester John. That a Christian king ruled over an Eastern people, remote from the centre of Christian life and isolated from the world, was a story that was very widely spread in early times; and inasmuch as more than one community answered to this description in distant parts of the world, it was natural that this king should be identified with the rulers of very different races. He was generally known as Presbyter Johannes or Prester John, and most travellers who went far afield in early times claimed to have discovered him.\n\nAt one time he was identified with the ruler of Abyssinia, where a dynasty of Christian kings has reigned for a long time. It is there that his country is placed in the Catalan map of 1375. There Shiltberger, who tells us he lived \"in der zerschlossenen rumany,\" seems to place him (ed. Neumann, p. 109). There also he is placed by De Lannoy (ed. Webb, p. 324). The position of Abyssinia was only vaguely known, hence when it was discovered that there was a Christian king in Georgia, who styled himself king, both of Georgia and Abkhazia or Abasia, which is very like the Arabic name of Abyssinia, Habsh, while the Georgian kings were occasionally called Ivan or John, it was easy to transfer to the Caucasian country of Abkhazia the stories which had been grouped about Abyssinia; hence we find the Master of the Teutonic Knights, Conrad of Yungingen, writing on the 20th of January, 1407, and addressing his letter to the King of Abasia, called Prester John (Regi Abassiae sive Presbytero\nJohanni, Karamzin, French translation, iii. p. 388, note 29). Thus Alberic, in his Chronicle, states that the Legate Pelagius \"misit nuntios in Abyssiniam terram et Georgianorum qui sunt Catholici\" (Carpini, ed. D'Avezac, p. 167). So, in the Genoese map of the year 1447, close to the Iron Gates in the Caucasus are inscribed the words, \"Hae turres con-struxit] presbiter Johannes rex . . . ad eum pateret accessus\" (Lelewel. Geog. du M. Age, Epilogue, 169). John de Hese of Utrecht, in his account of his journey to Jerusalem in 1489, speaks of Prester John as \"Maximus Indorum et Ethiopum christianissimus patriarchus,\" and describes him as suzerain of 72 kings, by which the kings of the traditional 72 tribes of the Caucasus are probably meant (id. note 39, and Bruun, Notices sur les Colonies Italiennes en Gazarie, p. 74 note, whence I have derived these references).\n\nIndia takes us to another region where a Christian community is said to have existed under King Gondophares, the patron of St. Thomas, and thither also we may go and find another Prester John. Carpini, inter alios, makes him an Indian ruler.\n\nIt is not to be wondered at, therefore, that the story, in the hands of the romance-loving chroniclers of the middle ages, becomes as vague in regard to the personality of King John as it does in regard to the geography of his kingdom and its whereabouts, and that they fill a r\u00f4le in the eyes of medi\u00e6val inquirers, like the Fortunate Isles, etc. The case was complicated when some letters were produced, claiming to have been written by Prester John himself, and by Pope Alexander in reply. These well-known epistles are found both in prose and in rhymed versions, and are undoubtedly of considerable antiquity. Colonel Yule, whose critical acumen in such matters few will question, thus speaks of them: \"Letters alleged to have been addressed by him were in circulation. Large extracts of them may be seen in Assmanni, and a translation has been given by Mr. Layard. By the circulation of these letters, glaring forgeries and fictions as they are, the idea of this great Christian conqueror was planted in the mind of the European nations\" (Cathey and the Way Thither,\nDr. Oppert speaks of them as of similar authority to the story of Sindbad the Sailor (Oppert, Der Presbyter Johannes, preface); and every dispassionate scholar who reads them will see at once, both from their style and contents, that Colonel Yule's strictures are well deserved. In them Prester John calls himself lord of the three Indies as far as where the Apostle Thomas preached, as far also as Babylon and the tower of Babel. \"Our land,\" he says, \"is the home of the elephant, dromedary, camel, crocodile, meta collinarum, came-tennus, tinsereete, panther, wild ass, white and red lion, white bear, . . . wild men, horned men, cyclopes, men with eyes behind and before, centaurs, fauns, satyrs, pigmies, giants twenty ells high, the phoenix,\" etc.\u2014in a word, of all the repertory, real and imaginary, of medi\u00e6val and mawkish natural history. Among his subjects were cannibals, Gog and Magog, the Anie and Agit, Azenaeh, Fommeperi, Befari, Conei Samante, Agrimandri, Salterci, Armei, Anafragei, Vintefolci, Casbei, Alanei. \"These and many others were driven by Alexander the Great,\" he says, \"among the high mountains of the moon.\" Assuredly the author of our letter was near akin to the author of Baron M\u00fcnchhausen. Who ever heard of these wonderful races save the Casbei and Alanei? But this is only a sample of the beginning, the absurdities continue to the end, nor is it profitable to quote them. They are printed at length in Dr. Oppert's work (Oppert, pp. 167-179), and are followed there by a portion of the journal of the travels of Johannes de Hese in several parts of the world, in which may be seen the confused geographical notions about India the greater and India the less, about the Asiatic and the African Ethiopians, etc. It is probable that the letters were concocted after Abyssinia had been fixed upon as Prester John's country, most of the marvels described in them being such as have their home in Africa; while to suit the topography with the old stories about the evangelizing of the further East by St. Thomas, the land of Prester John was made to include the further India, which was the special field of his labours, and the intervening country; and other details were filled in from the accounts brought home by the missionaries\nof Tibet, where another pontiff-ruler reigned. The river Yeonus, whose source was in Paradise, which flowed through Prester John's country, according to the letters, is no other than the river of Paradise Gyon or Gihon, thus described by John de Marignolli in the middle of the fourteenth century: \"Gyon is that which circleth the land of Ethiopia, where are now the negroes, and which is called the land of Prester John. It is indeed believed to be the Nile which descends into Egypt by a breach made in the place which is called Abasty, i.e. Abyssinia\" (Cathay and the Way Thither, p. 348). Colonel Yule adds the note that many fathers of the Church believed the Gihon passed underground from Paradise to reappear as the Nile, that Pomponius Mela supposes the Nile to come under the sea from the Autichthonic world, and other heathen writers believed it to be a resurrection of the Euphrates (id. p. 348, note). These vague and indefinite notices about Prester John acquired definiteness and form in the pages of the Nestorian missionaries to the far East, and in those of the Franciscan friars and others who visited the Mongol dominions, and who claimed to have met Prester John himself and his people. It then became clear that the person who had the chief claim to the style and distinction was neither the king of Abyssinia nor the ruler of Georgia, of Tibet, or of India, but one of the chiefs living on the borders of the Mongols; and opinion became settled that he must be identified with the chief of the Kirais or Keraits, for reasons which I will presently condense. This view was shared by every responsible author until, a few years ago, M. Gustav Oppert startled the world with an entirely new theory, which captivated one or two inquirers of fame, but which I believe to be baseless, and to have no better credentials than novelty and audacity.\n\nThe mainstay of M. Oppert's theory are some passages in the chronicles of Bishop Otto of Freisingen, of Benjamin of Tudela, and of William of Ruysbrok or Rubruquis, which we must now examine.\n\nOtto of Freisingen tell us that when at Rome in 1145 he saw the Syrian Bishop of Gabala (Gibal, south of Loadieea, in Northern Syria), who had gone there to lay before\nPope Eugenius the Third the peril of the Church in the East since the capture of Edessa. \"He also told us,\" says Otto, \"how, not many years before, one John, king and priest, who dwells in the extreme Orient beyond Persia and Armenia, and is with his people a Christian, but a Nestorian, had waged war against the brother kings of the Persians and the Medes, who are called the Samiardes, and had captured Ecbatana (of which he had spoken above), the seat of their dominion. The said kings having met him with their forces, made up of Persians, Medes, and Syrians, the battle had been maintained for three days, either party preferring death to flight. But at last Presbyter John, for so they are wont to style him, having routed the Persians, came forth the victor from a most sanguinary battle. After this victory (he went on to say) the aforesaid John was advancing to fight in aid of the Church at Jerusalem; but when he arrived at the Tigris and found there no possible means of transport for his army, he turned northward, as he had heard that the river in that quarter was frozen over in winter time. Halting there for some years in expectation of a frost, which never came owing to the mildness of the season, he lost many of his people through the unaccustomed climate, and was obliged to return homewards. This personage was said to be of the ancient race of those Magi who were mentioned in the Gospel, and to rule the same nations as they did, and to have such glory and wealth that he used (they say) only an emerald sceptre. It was (they say) from his being fired by the example of his fathers, who came to adore Christ in the cradle, that he was proposing to go to Jerusalem when he was prevented by the cause already alleged\" (Yule's Marco Polo, 2nd edition, vol. ii. pp. 539, 534). We may add that Otto elsewhere identifies Ecbatana with the Armenian town Ani (id. p. 541). Such is the statement upon which the theory of M. Oppert is mainly founded. He identifies the \"Persarum et Medorum reges fratres, Samiardos dictos\" with Sanjar and his brother Barkiarok, the Seljuki rulers of Khorasan and Persia, etc., arguing that Samiardos and Sanjar are the same word. He then goes on to identify the battle\nabove named with the great defeat sustained by Sultan Sanjar at the hands of the Gurkhan of Kara Khitai, whom he in turn identifies with Prester John (Oppert, op. cit. p. 135). But, as has been urged by M. Bruun, at the time of Sultan Sanjar's celebrated defeat, his brothers had been long dead. Ani was certainly not his royal residence, nor yet was Hamadan, which M. Oppert identifies with the Ecbatana of Otto, in spite of the latter's own interpretation of the name (Yule's Marco Polo, 2nd edition, vol. ii. p. 540). Nor is there the slightest evidence in the Persian and Arabic historians, so far as I know, that the Gurkhan either captured Ani or advanced to the Tigris, nor that he and his people were Christians; in fact, they were, on the contrary, almost certainly Buddhists. The fact is, the narrative of Otto is unreliable from end to end. The only foundation of fact it probably contains is this: a belief in an Eastern powerful Christian king named Prester John was then prevalent in the East, and the Christians there, who were being harassed by the attacks of the Seljuki Turks and the Saracens, were only too ready to identify any potent enemy of their oppressors who came from the East with Prester John. Such an enemy was he who defeated Sultan Sanjar, and it may be that his victory is the foundation of Otto's distorted narrative; and that is all we can say.\n\nWe will now consider the statements of Benjamin of Tudela. Few medi\u00e6val authors read more suspiciously in many places than does Benjamin of Tudela, and so fly-blown are his pages that his work has been pronounced a forgery by some critics. Mr. Asher, his latest editor, who has published an elaborate translation of the work with notes, has to make apologies for his narrative, and tells us that he did not go to many places described in his itinerary. Among the suspicious passages in his narrative few are more suspicious, and even incomprehensible, than the passage relied upon by M. Oppert, as has been hinted by Mr. Asher (vide Benjamin of Tudela, by Asher, vol. ii. p. 175).\n\nThis passage I shall abstract from Mr. Asher's translation;\nit says, \"The cities of Nishapur were inhabited in his day by four tribes of Israel, namely, Dan, Zabulon, Asser, and Naphtali, being part of the exiles who were carried into captivity by Shalmaneser, King of Assyria, as mentioned in Scripture, who banished them to Lachlach and Chabor, and the mountains of Gozen and the mountains of Media; their country was twenty days' journey in extent, and they possessed many towns and cities in the mountains; the river Kizil Ozein was their boundary on one side, and they were subject to their own prince, who bore the name of Rabbi Joseph Amarkh la Halevi. . . . Some of them were excellent scholars, and others carried on agriculture; others again were engaged in war with the country of Cuth by way of the desert. They were in alliance with the Caphar Tarac, or infidel Turks, who adored the wind and lived in the desert. They ate no bread and drank no wine, but devoured their meat raw and quite unprepared. They had no noses, but drew breath through two small holes, and ate all sorts of meat, whether from clean or unclean beasts, and were on very fricudly terms with the Jews.\n\n\"About eighteen years before this nation invaded Persia with a numerous host and took the city of Rai, which they smote with the edge of the sword, took all the spoil, and returned to their deserts. Nothing similar was seen before in the kingdom of Persia, and when the king of that country heard of the occurrence, he was wrath; . . . he raised a war-cry in his whole empire, collected all his troops, and made inquiry for a guide to show him where the enemy had pitched his tents. A man was found who said he would show the king the place of their retreat, for he was one of them. The king promised to enrich him if he would. He told them fifteen days' provisions of bread and water would be needed for crossing the desert, for there were no provisions to be had on the way. They accordingly marched for fifteen days, and at length suffered great distress; the guide excused himself by saying he had missed his way, and his head was cut off by the king's command. The remaining provisions were equally divided, but at length everything eatable was\nconsumed, and after travelling for thirteen additional days in the desert, they at length reached the mountains of Khazbin, where the Jews dwelt. They encamped in the gardens and orchards, and near the springs, which are on the river Kizil Ozein. It was the fruit season, and they made free and destroyed much, but no living being came forward. On the mountains, however, they discovered cities and many towers, and the king commanded two of his servants to go and ask the name of the nation which inhabited those mountains, and to cross over to them either in boats or by swimming the river. They at last discovered a large bridge, fortified by towers and secured by a locked gate, and on the other side of the bridge a considerable city. They shouted; when a man came out to ask what they wanted, they could not make themselves understood, and sent for an interpreter who spoke both languages. Upon the questions being repeated, they replied, 'We are the servants of the King of Persia, and have come to enquire who you are and whose subjects.' The answer was, 'We are Jews, we acknowledge no king or prince of the Gentiles, but are subjects of a Jewish prince.' Upon inquiries after the Ghuzi, the Caphar Tarac or infidel Turks, the Jews made answer, 'Verily they are our allies; whoever seeks to harm them, we consider our own enemy.'\n\n\"The two men returned and reported to the king of Persia, who became much afraid, and especially when after two days the Jews sent a herald to offer him battle. The king said: 'I am not come to war against you, but against the Caphar Tarac, who are my enemies; and if you attack me, I will certainly take my vengeance, and will destroy all the Jews in my kingdom, for I am well aware of your superiority over me in my present position; but I entreat you to act kindly, and not to harass me, but allow me to fight with the Caphar Tarac, my enemy, and also to sell me as much provision as I need for my host.' The Jews took counsel together, and determined to comply with the Persian king's request for the sake of his Jewish subjects. They were thereupon admitted, and for fifteen days were treated with most honourable distinction and respect. The Jews, however, meanwhile sent\ninformation to their allies the Caphar Tarac. These took possession of all the mountain passes and assembled a large host, consisting of all the inhabitants of that desert; and when the King of Persia went forth to give them battle, the Caphar Tarac conquered and slew so many of the Persians that the king escaped to his country with only very few followers.\" In his escape he carried off a Jew named R. Mosh\u00e9, and it was from this person that Benjamin claims to have heard the story (Benjamin of Tudela, Asher's Translation, vol. i. p. 129, etc.).\n\nI have preferred to extract the whole piece, so that it may speak for itself. The Caphar Tarac, or rather Kofar al Turuk or infidel Turks, of Benjamin M. Oppert identifies with the Kara Khitai, and the defeated Persian king with Sanjar. He alters the Nishapur of Asher into Nisbin, which he also writes where Asher writes Khazbin, i.e. Kazvin; the Kizil Ozein of the latter he reads Gosan, and identifies the country described as the neighbourhood of Samarkand. Granting that these emendations are good, which I see no reason to do since Asher's names are those of perfectly well-known places, what a marvellous geographical jumble Benjamin's story remains! But it is not with this we have to deal. We know the history of the campaign which Sanjar fought against the Kara Khitai in tolerable detail from Persian and other sources, but not one syllable of this queer romantic story is found among them; but we need not trouble ourselves to go outside the document itself: does not it identify the Caphar Tarac, not with the Kara Khatai, but with the Ghuz, who were infidel Turks, although the Mussulman Seljuki and other Turkomans sprang from them? Were not these Ghuz at this very time harassing Persia, and did not they eventually carry off Sanjar as their prisoner? There is surely no answer to this except M. Oppert's, who makes the passage to be a corruption\u2014surely a very easy way out of the difficulty. From end to end of it there is nothing about Kara Khitai or Prester John; nor, as M. Bruun has remarked, is it to be forgotten that Benjamin expressly tells us that the Caphar Tarac worshipped the wind, while the subjects of Prester\nJohn were Christians. This second authority of M. Oppert's therefore fails entirely. Now for the third.\n\nThe story of Rubruquis is as follows: \"At the time when the Franks took Antioch, the sovereignty in these Northern regions was held by a certain Coir Cham. Coir was his proper name, Cham his title, the word having the meaning of soothsayer, which is applied to their princes because they govern by means of divination.\" And we read in the history of Antioch that the Turks sent for succour against the Franks to king Coir Cham, for all the Turks came originally from those parts of the world. Now this Coir was of Cara Catay; Cara meaning black, and Catay being the name of a nation, so that Cara Catay is as much as to say the Black Cathayens. And they were so called to distinguish them from the proper Cathayens, who dwelt upon the ocean in the far East. But those Black Cathayens inhabited certain mountain pastures (alpes) which I passed through, and in a certain plain among those mountains dwelt a certain Nestorian, who was a mighty shepherd and lord over the people called Naiman, who were Nestorian Christians; and when Coir Cham died, that Nestorian raised himself to be king (in his place), and the Nestorians used to call him King John, and to tell things of him ten times in excess of the truth.\"\n\nThis is tolerably correct history, except, as I shall show presently, in its identifying the chief of the Naimans with Prester John, but it is anything but a support to Dr. Oppert's theory. Rubruquis here identifies Prester John, not with the Gurkhan of Kara Khitai, but with Gushluk or Kushluk, the Naiman king who supplanted him; while it is the Naimans, and not the Kara Khitai, who are said to have been Christians.\n\nRubruquis is not content with this passage, but in another later on he says expressly, \"Post hoc intravimus planiciem illam in qua erat curia Keucan (i.e. Kuyuk Khan) qu\u00e6 solebat\n\n1 A corruption between Khan, chief, and Kam, the medicine man of the Shamanists.\u2014Cathay and the Way Thither, p. 176, note 2.\nesse terra Naiman, qui erant proprii homines ipsius Presbiteri Johannis.\u201d Here he expressly tells us it was the Naimans who were the people of Prester John.\n\nIt must be confessed that so grave a theory was seldom based upon so slender a foundation. There is no evidence that either the Kara Khitai or their chief were Christians; on the contrary, Abulfaraj, as we shall see, distinctly tells us that the king of Kara Khitai persuaded Wang Khan to apostatize from the Christian religion and to join his own.\n\nLet us now turn to the direct evidence for identifying Prester John\u2019s people with the Kirais or Kerait, and we will begin with the very first notice we can find of Prester John, which is reported by Bar Hebraeus.\n\nGregory Abulfaraj was the son of a Jewish physician named Aaron, whence he was styled Bar Hebraeus. He was a native of Malatiya, and became a Jacobite Christian. He was born in 1226, and in 1244 fled from the invading Mongols to Antioch. In 1245 he became Bishop of Guba, later Bishop of Aleppo, then Primate of the Jacobites, and died in 1286 (Oppert, der Presbyter Johannis, p. 87, note). He wrote two chronicles (or rather two versions of one chronicle), one in Syriac and the other in Arabic. The Syriac text was translated by Bruns and Kirsch, but apparently Assemani, the author of the Bibliotheca Orientalis, had a more complete copy before him. The latter, who is a very careful writer, quotes from Bar Hebraeus as follows: \u201cIn the year 398 of the Hijira, i.e. 1007, a tribe called Keryt, living in the inner land of the Turks, was converted to Christianity, and their king was baptised. . . . At that time Ebedjesus, metropolitan of Merv, wrote to the Nestorian Catholicos or Patriarch, saying, \u201cThe king of the Keryt people, who live in the inner Turk land, while he was hunting in a high mountain of his kingdom, and having got into the snow and lost his way, suddenly saw a saint, who thus addressed him: \u2018If you will believe in Christ, I will show you a way on which you shall not perish.\u2019 Then did the king promise to become a sheep in Christ\u2019s fold. Having been shown the way, the king on reaching home summoned\nthe Christian merchants who were at his court and adopted their faith. Having received a copy of the gospels, which he worshipped daily, he sent me a messenger with the request that I should go to him or send him a priest who should baptise him. In regard to fasting, he inquired how they should fast who had no food but flesh and milk. Finally, he mentioned that the number of his people who had been converted was 200,000.\" Upon this the Catholicos sent to the metropolitan for two priests and deacons, with the necessary altar furniture, to baptise these people and convert them. And in regard to fasting, that they should abstain from meat, and live on milk, inasmuch as the meats prohibited during the forty days' fast were not found in his country (Assemani, Bibl. Orient. vol. iii. pt. 2, p. 485; D'Ohrsson, vol. i. p. 48, note; Oppert, op. cit. p. 88). The same event is referred to in the life of the patriarch Maris Bar Tobi by Mares, and is reported there upon the evidence of the same letter (Assemani, op. cit. vol. iii. pt. 2, p. 484; Oppert, p. 88, note).\n\nHere, then, is the very first mention we have in a western writer of a Christian people in Inner Asia, and strangely enough the name is Keryt, while the details of the story have all the air of truth about them. If the Keryt were an insignificant tribe, as Oppert argues, and if the real Prester John was the sovereign of Kara Khitai, how is it that the name Keryt should have reached the ears of the Syrian chronicler at all, and why should the Catholicos have called them Keryt? Surely this one fact outweighs all M. Oppert's arguments put together. Again, Abulfaraj mentions that:\n\n\"In the year of the Greeks 1514, of the Arabs 599 (i.e. A.D. 1202), Unk Khan, who is the Christian King Johannes, ruling over a tribe of the barbarian Huns called Keryt, was served with great diligence by Chinghiz Khan.\" . . . The chronicler goes on to describe the struggle between the two, and then proceeds: \"But it must be known that the King Johannes, the Keryt, was not overthrown without cause. This happened when he forsook the fear of Christ, who had raised him up, and had taken a wife from a Chinese nation\ncalled Karakhata; then he forsook the religion of his fathers and served strange gods. God took away his kingdom and gave it to one worthier than he, and his heart was upright before God.\"\n\nIn these notices we have another important fact. If the dates attached to them are reliable, it makes it impossible to identify Prester John with the chief of Kara Khitai, for that empire was only founded in 1125, on the overthrow of the Khitan empire in China by the Kin dynasty, and in them we have a mention of the conversion of the Keryt more than a century earlier. We also see clearly that Abulfaraj identifies the well-known Unk or Wang Khan of the Kerait with Prester John, and goes further, for he attributes his defection from the Christian faith to his marriage with a daughter of the Khan of Kara Khitai, who, according to Dr. Oppert, was himself the Presbyter Johannes of that day.\n\nLet us now turn to the narrative of Rubruquis. He says that \"the Nestorians spread great tales about the King John, although when he (Rubruquis) passed over the land that had been his pasture grounds (i.e. the Naiman country), nobody knew anything about him except a few Nestorians. Those pastures were then occupied by Keu Cham (i.e. Kuyuk Khan). . . . Now this John had a brother who was also a great pastoral chief, whose name was Une, and he dwelt on the other side of those alps of Cara Catay, some three weeks' journey distant from his brother, being the lord of a certain little town called Caracorum, and ruling over a people called Crit and Mecrit (i.e. Kerait and Merkit). These people were also Nestorian Christians, but their lord had abandoned Christianity and had taken to idolatry, keeping about him those priests of the idols who are all addicted to sorcery and invocation of demons.\" This account is a strange mixture of truth and error. It seems almost incredible to suppose that the Naimans were Christians. I have already identified them with the Turkish tribe Naiman, which forms a section of the middle horde of the Kirghiz Kazaks, and we have no evidence anywhere else that Christianity prevailed among them; they were probably Shamanists, like many of their\ndescendants are still, while their chiefs were perhaps Buddhists. Rubruquis's own statement that when he passed through their country nobody knew anything of Prester John save a few Nestorians is conclusive. Again, it is very certain that Kushluk, chief of the Naimans, who supplanted the ruler of Kara Khitai, and thus became himself Gur Khan, was no brother of Unc or Wang, the chief of the Kirais or Kerait. But this mistake was easily made, for Wang Khan had an uncle styled Gur Khan, to whom I shall refer presently, and it is this uncle who has doubtless been confused by Rubruquis with the other Gur Khan, and who has sophisticated his narrative. This seems clear when we continue his story, which goes on thus: \"Now King John being dead, without leaving an heir, his brother Unc was brought in and caused himself to be called Cham, and his flocks and herds spread about even to the borders of Moab,\" etc. It is of course absurd to argue that Wang, chief of the Kerait, succeeded Kushluk, the Naiman leader, but not so ridiculous to suppose he supplanted his own brothers, which we in fact know that he did. The story of Rubruquis, when cleared of this obvious confusion, confirms remarkably the testimony of other witnesses that Prester John was the ruler of the Kerait.\n\nIn the first place, while the probabilities are very great that the Kara Khitai and the greater part of the Naimans were Buddhists, the evidence that the Kerait were Christians is overwhelming. Thus Rashid-ud-din, a very independent authority, says of them: \"The Kerait had their own Padi-shahs, and professed the Christian faith.\"\n\nElsewhere he tells us that Khulagu's chief wife was Dokuz Khatun, the daughter of Iku, son of Wang Khan. She had been his father's wife, and he goes on to say: \"As the Kerait had for a long time been Christians, Dokuz Khatun was much attached to the Christians, who, during her life, were in a flourishing condition. Khulagu favoured the Christians in consequence all over his empire, new churches were constantly built, and at the gate of the Ordu or Camp of Dokuz Khatun there was a chapel, where bells were con-\nstantly rung\u201d (Quatrem\u00e8re\u2019s Rashid, pp. 94, 95). Khulagu\u2019s mother was Siurukteni Bigi, daughter of Jakhanbo, the brother of the king of the Kerait. Rashid says of her, \u201cAlthough she was a Christian, yet she showed great consideration for the Moslem Imams, etc.\u201d\n\nThese extracts from a most unexceptional witness will suffice to show that the Kerait were Christians. Not only so, but the southern part of their country and the neighbouring province of Kansu seem to have been strongholds of Nestorian Christianity. Tanchet, i.e. Tangut, is expressly named as one of the metropolitan sees of the Nestorians (Cathay and the Way Thither, p. 179).\n\nThe concurrence of evidence, which is by no means exhausted in the preceding paragraphs, makes it plain that the only Prester John of whom we can safely predicate that we have knowledge at first hand was the ruler of the Kerait, as has been held by all the most responsible historians of the further East.\n\nThe next question is, Where did the Kerait live? Where was their home? Upon this and many other matters about them the most satisfactory authority is that discovered not many years ago by the Archimandrite Palladius in the Imperial Library at Peking, being apparently the main source whence Rashid-ud-din drew his account of Chinghiz Khan and his ancestors. This chronicle, composed in Mongolia in 1240, is known by its Chinese name of Yuan chao pi shi. It was translated into Russian in the \u201cMemoirs of the Peking Mission.\u201d I shall have to quote it frequently. According to this authority the main seat of Tughril, the chief of the Kerait, was on the river Tula. It is to the Black Forest on the river Tula that he continually returns home after his various expeditions. When Yessugei restored Tughril to his people in the year 1171, we are expressly told they were living on the river Tula (Yuan chao pi shi, p. 92). When Chinghiz Khan returned home with his young wife for the first time, he repaired to Tughril\u2019s camp, which we are told was on the Tula (id. 48, 49), and so in other places.\n\nRubruquis also assigns the same district as the home of\nUnc, the chief of the Crit and Mecrit, who he tells us was the lord of a little town called Karakorum: that is, of the famous town which became the first capital of the Mongols, and which the researches of M. Paderin and others enable us to fix the site of, close to the Orkhon.\n\nD'Ohsson in fact tells us (I do not know on what authority), that the Kerait occupied the banks of the Tula and the Orkhon, as well as the neighbourhood of the Karakorum mountains. Rashid-ud-din says vaguely that the Kerait lived in outer Mongolia, in a district bordering on the Onon and the Kerulon, and also on the borders of Khitai or China (Berezine, vol. i. p. 94, Erdmann, Temudjin, pp. 230, 231).\n\nThis statement of Rashid goes to show that the Kerait country stretched across the so-called Mongolian desert to the frontiers of China, and this is amply confirmed by the notices of other writers.\n\nThe Yellow River at one portion of its course makes a very extraordinary bend, almost at right angles with itself. The district bounded on the north and west by this elbow is the well-known country of the Ordus. North of the river is the camping ground of the Tumeds of Koko Khotan, the Urads, Maominggans, etc. West of the river is a great stretch of country, which before the days of Chinghiz was very thriving and populous, and which formed the empire of Hia, with its capital at Ninghia. To the Mongols it was known as Tangut, and it was the scene of some of their most dreadful butcheries. This empire of Hia included the Ordus country (Timkowski, vol. ii. p. 266), and it stretched away westward as far at least as Sachiu (Yule's Marco Polo, 2nd ed. vol. i. p. 444), while it extended northwards to Etzina, on the borders of the desert (id. vol. i. p. 225).\n\nMarco Polo has given us the best description of this district. In describing the province of Egrigaia, which belonged to Tangut, he tells us its capital was Calashan, which Colonel Yule identifies with great probability with Din yuan yin, the capital of the modern kingdom of Alashan, situated a little west of the Yellow River (id. vol. i. p. 273). After describing this province, he continues,\n\"we shall now proceed eastward from this place and enter the territory that was formerly Prester John's\" (id. vol. i. p. 272). This territory he calls Tenduc, and he tells us its capital was also called Tenduc, that it had been the capital of Prester John, and that his heirs still ruled there (id. vol. i. pp. 275, 276). After leaving the province, he proceeded eastward for three days, and then arrived at Chaghan nur (id. vol. i. pp. 276, 286). This description answers exactly to the site fixed upon by Colonel Yule, namely, \"the extensive and well-cultivated plain which stretches from the Yellow River past the city of Koko Khotan, which still abounds in the remains of cities attributed to the Mongol era\" (id. vol. i. p. 277). Colonel Yule further suggests that it is not improbable that the modern city of Koko Khotan, which was called Tsingchau in the middle ages, is on the same site as Prester John's capital (rather of his southern capital.\u2014II. H. H.). I am disposed to agree most emphatically in this, one of the happiest of the very many happy suggestions of Colonel Yule, not only because the site answers the description, but because we know how constant important trading posts and cities are to their old sites in the East, and that Koko Khotan is by far the most important city of this district. M. Pauthier identifies Tenduc with Ta thung, the name of a city and fu of Northern Shansi, south of the Wall, and not very far from Koko Khotan. We may take it therefore that the country of Prester John, as understood by Polo, included the district now held by the Tumedes of Koko Khotan and its neighbourhood.\n\nFrom these notices we can roughly map out the country of the Kerait as extending from the watershed between the Selinga and the Tula to the Yellow River. On the North they were bounded by the Merkit, who, in my view, were a section of the Uighurs, and who occupied the upper waters of the Selinga; towards the East they were apparently bounded by the Jelairs, who lived on the Kerulon and who were also Uighurs. On the South they were limited by the empire of Tangut or Hia, and on the West they were largely bounded by the Naimans, whom I now believe to have been\nalso Uighurs, and from whom they were partially separated by the so-called Ektag Altai, i.e. the Great Altai.\n\nTheir Northern capital was apparently Karakorum, and their Southern one Koko Khotan, or some place close to it; and at the beginning of the thirteenth century they were probably the most powerful tribe in Mongolia.\n\nLet us now examine who they were, and whence they came. The earlier writers almost universally treated them as Mongols, and in writing the first volume of my history of the Mongols I did so also, and identified them with the Torguts. Presently, on examining the question further, I became convinced that they were Turks; and I embodied this view in a long note to the same volume.\n\nSo far as I know no ancient author calls them Mongols. Rashid-ud-din classes them among the peoples who afterwards adopted the name Mongol, and puts them in a separate class with five other tribes, none of which are Mongol, four being unmistakably Turkish, and the fifth the Tangutans of another stock than that of the Mongols. Khuandemir calls them Turks; while, as we have seen, Ebedjesus says they lived in the inner Turk land.\n\nIf we examine the direct evidence upon which the Kerait have been treated as Mongols, it will be found to be very feeble. It consists mainly in the fact that Chinghiz Khan had intimate relations with their chief. This is not much. So he had with the chiefs of the Karluks and Uighurs, who are everywhere allowed to have been Turks. Pallas and others pointed out that the chief family among the Torguts, a Kalmuk tribe, is still called Kerct. This may be paired off with the corresponding fact that the royal stock among the Tartars of the Crimea was also called Ghirei or Kirei. In neither case is the fact of much importance, for the royal family among these broken tribes is in most cases of foreign extraction. It is much more important to find that not a mere family only, but one of the five great divisions of the Middle Horde of the Kirghiz Kazaks is called Kirai or Uvak Kirai; while a tribe of the Little Horde of the Kirghiz Kazaks is called Kircit. A minor tribe among the Uzbegs\nis also called Kireit, while one of the five sections of the\nKungrads is called Kir. All these are tribes of very decided\nTurkish blood.\n\nAs good evidence that they were Turks we may take the\nnames of their chiefs, at least those whose orthography we\ncan be at all sure of. The earliest of these mentioned by\nRashid-ud-din is Merghuz Buirukh. The former of these\nnames has been identified as the Western name Mark. I\nshall return to it again. Buirukh or Buyurnk is a\nTurkish word, and means Emperor (see D'Ohsson, vol. i. p.\n50, note). His eldest son was also entitled Buirukh, his\npersonal name being Khurechakns. The sons of this last\nprince were the famous so-called Wang Khan and his\nbrothers. In the Yuan ehaop shi Wang Khan's real name\nis given as Tu u ril, while Rashid gives it as Tnghril, i.e.\nthe very familiar Turkish name meaning a bird of prey\n(D'Ohsson, vol. i. p. 51, note), and borne by some famous\nTurkish chieftains. His next brother was Erke Kara. Kara\nis Turkish for black, and Erke means strength in the same\nlanguage. The next one was called Tai Timur. Timur is\na very typical Turkish name, and means iron. The next\nbrother was called Bnkhua or Buka Timur. Here we have\nthe name Timur again repeated, while Buka is a well-known\nTurkish name borne by the stem father of the Uighur\nprinces, and meaning a bull. The fifth son was called Ilka\nSankun. Rashid tells us the former was his name, while\nthe latter meant in Chinese son of a chieftain. Ilka, accord-\ning to Berezine, means a herd of horses in Turkish.\n\nThese names will suffice to prove that the Kirais were\nTurks and not Mongols. The next point to determine is\nwhich branch or tribe of the Turks did they belong to. I\nidentified them formerly with the Uighurs, chiefly because for\na long time the latter lived like the Kirais did in the neigh-\nbourhood of Tangut. This view I no longer hold; I believe\nthem, in fact, to have been Kirghiz or Kirghiz Kazaks, a view\nwhich seems to me to considerably clear up a confused\nchapter in the history of Central Asia. Nowhere are the\nKirais said to have been Uighurs, nor do we meet with their\nname among Uighur tribes. Let us therefore see what evidence there is to identify the Kirais or Kerait with the Kirghiz. First, in regard to their name, the final \\( t \\) in Kerait, like that in many tribal names, is the Mongol plural termination, and the name is really Kerai or rather Kirai. This name is the very one by which a principal branch of the Kirghiz Kazaks of the Middle Horde is still known, and the more recent Russian writers have no hesitation in coming to the very reasonable conclusion, in which I concur, that these Kirais of the Upper Irtish are descended from or rather belong to the same stock as the Kirais of the time of Chinghiz Khan.\n\nThere has been much confusion about the history of the Uzbegs and Kazaks, which I hope I have partially cleared up in the second volume of my History of the Mongols. Both confederacies of nomad tribes have several tribal names in common, showing that they have some common elements, if they are not of the same origin, and I believe that in the main, and with the exception of some imported factors which may be discriminated, they are so. The confederacies are political rather than social, and comprise the tribes once subject to Juchi, the eldest son of Chinghiz Khan, and the founder of the Golden Horde, and to Ogotai, the third son of that great conqueror. When the family of Ogotai was destroyed, a portion of his heritage passed over and joined the tribes subject to the house of Juchi. Among these were, I believe, the Naimans, the Jelairs, and the other nomad Uighurs. Excluding these latter tribes, and possibly some others, what remained formed the so-called Golden Horde dominating all the country from the Upper Irtish to the Volga, and from Ferghana to Siberia.\n\nUzbeg Khan of the Golden Horde is distinctly stated to have introduced Muhammadanism among these nomads, and to have converted them by force. A large number of tribesmen at this time took his name and were thenceforward known as Uzbegs. Those who remained pagans and refused to conform were in the main, in my view, people of precisely the same race and, as the tribal names show, of the same\nclans. They were known as Kazaks, or vagabonds. When the empire of Timur broke to pieces, as we have elsewhere shown, the so-called Uzbegs migrated into Ferghana and Maveranahr, and founded the principalities of Bukhara, Khokand, etc. The Kazaks remained behind, and are still found in the same country under the name of Kirghiz Kazaks. The name Uzbeg is therefore a very modern one, and the confederacy a very artificial one.\n\nThe Kazaks, too, as we have seen, are formed of mixed elements, and this according to their own traditions. They have also invaded countries beyond their own original borders. Before the fifteenth century the country now occupied by the Little Horde of the Kazaks was the camping ground of the Nogais or Mangut; while the country to the east of the Nogais was occupied by the Kipchaks, who, like the Naimans and Jelairs, were, I believe, not original elements of the Kazak community. This view limits the true original Kazaks, both in race and locality, and brings them into very close contact in both respects with the so-called true Kirghises (Rock Kirghises, or Black Kirghises), and justifies the name which the Russians have always given them, and to which exception has been recently taken, namely, Kirghiz Kazaks. A legend of the Black Kirghises reported by Radlof states that formerly they had no Khan, and they thereupon asked the great Khan (i.e. Chinghiz) to give them his son Juchi as chief. He was only a boy, and while en route he met a flock of kulans, or wild asses, with which he went away. Aksak Kulon Juchi Khan was, they affirm, the first and last Khan of the Kirghiz (Radlof, \"Aus Sibirien,\" vol. i. p. 533). They claim that among them are neither khans nor nobles as among the Kazaks. I believe that in this we have a key to the position. That section of the Kirghiz which submitted to the Khans of the Golden Horde, and became their subjects, and had among them princes and nobles of that stock, the so-called White Bones, were the Kazaks, while those who remained free and independent are the Kara Kirghises. I would suggest, therefore, that before the twelfth century the distinction and contrast now so often pressed between the\nKirghises proper and the Kirghiz Kazaks did not exist, and that all were in fact Kirghiz. The free, the untameable, the vagabond, have retained their old names; while the cultivated, who have always been subject to princes descended from Chinghiz Khan, have acquired a softer language and less rude manners, and have their name of Kirghiz qualified by that of Kazak. The original home of the true Kirghises is largely the country now occupied by the Middle Horde of the Kirghiz Kazaks.\n\nThe Black Kirghises migrated, in considerable numbers apparently so lately as the sixteenth century, to their present camping grounds, but their original home, their fatherland, is the country of the Lake Saissan and the Upper Irtish, the country where the Kirais still live, who, I would urge, have the best claims to be among the truest of true Kirghiz.\n\nBefore we turn to the history of the Kirais we will devote a few lines to a consideration of their name. Rashid-ud-din has a characteristic etymology of it. He says that it was reported how in olden times there was a Padishah who had eight sons, all of whom had dark skins, whence they were called Kerait (Erdmann, Temudschin, p. 231). It is not impossible that the name Kirai is connected with Kara, which in Turkish and Mongol (?) is black, although in that case it ought to read Karai and not Kerei. Berezine suggests (vol. i. note 91), that it may be connected with Kerie, in Mougol a crow. In another place (id. note 173) he suggests a connection with the Manchu Kerceu, meaning common or general. These derivations are more or less far-fetched and I prefer to see in the name Kirai a mere corruption of Kirghiz. Among the Mongols, as may be seen in Ssanang Setzen, the Kirghiz were called Kerghud; d or t is the plural termination, so that the name of the tribe becomes Kerghu or Kerghi; and as is well known, the dropping of the soft guttural is a most common corruption of Mongol words, thus Baghatur is almost invariably written Baatur, Kaghan Kaan, Khulaghu Khulau, and so on, so that the natural name of the Kirghiz among the Mongols would\nbe Kerei or Kirai. There is a Kirai lake in the Gobi desert which may possibly be connected with the Kirais.\n\nThe Kirais were divided into several clans, the most complete notice of which we owe to Rashid-ud-din, who names six of them. These are. 1. The Kerait, to which the royal stock belonged and which probably gave its name to the race. 2. The Tongknt, as Berezine reads the name, or Tunegkhait or Tungkait as it is read by Erdmann and D'Ohsson. 3. The Sakiyat. 4. The Jirkins or Chirkirs. 5. The Dobout or Tumaut. 6. The Aliyat or Albat (Berezine, Rashid-ud-din, vol. i. pp. 95, 96, Erdmann, p. 231, D'Ohsson, vol. i. p. 405). In the Yuan chao pi shi we also read of a clan Kirai, of a second Dunkhait, of a tribe Tumian Tubigan, and of another Oman or Oluan (op. cit. pp. 75, 88, and note 241).\n\nLet us now try and unriddle the history of the Kirais. We have seen what was the country which they occupied at the end of the twelfth century. Previous to the middle of the ninth century it is most clear that the same area was occupied by the Uighurs, who had their capital at Karakorum, whence they dominated over the various nomads of Central Asia, including the Kirghises. The latter then lived along the Irtish. According to the official history of the Tang dynasty, called the Tang shi, it was in the middle of the year Kian yuan (i.e. 758 A.D.) when the Kirghiz were subdued by the Uighurs, and thenceforward they no longer sent envoys to the Chinese court. The As\u00e9 or Oje, as their chief was called, became a tributary of the Khakan of the Uighurs, and their subsequent history is that of their suzerains.\n\nIn the fourth year Khai sing (i.e. 839), one of the Uighur grandees revolted, and led the S'a tho, a subordinate tribe, against the Khakan of the Uighurs and defeated him. The defeated Khakan killed himself in despair, and his successor had to face in the same year famine, pestilence, and a cattle disease. So that there was great distress among his people. Thereupon we read that the As\u00e9, i.e. the chief of the Kirghises, rebelled too, and proclaimed himself Khakan, and gave his mother and wife the style Khatun, which in\neffect meant that he aspired, not merely to rule his Kirghises independently, but to be Emperor of Nomadic Asia (Schott, Die Aeehten Kirgisen, pp. 456\u20137). His mother was a daughter of the chief of the Tukisi (?), and his wife a daughter of the ruler of the Khololo or Karluks (Visdelou, Hist. de la Tartaire, ed. 1780, p. 79).\n\nThe Khan of the Uighurs sent an army against him, but could not subdue him. The war lasted twenty years without interruption. The chief of the Kirghises, inflated by his successes, sent word to the Khan of the Uighurs, saying, \"Your time is ended; I will come presently and capture your golden tent, and will hold horse races in front of it (Schott says tether my horses before it), and plant my standards there. If you think you can resist me, I will await you; if you do not think so, you had better retreat at once.\" The Uighurs were unable to revenge this affront. On the contrary, one of their chiefs named Kiu lo mo ho actually guided the Kirghises in their attack. The Kirghises were completely successful, and cut off the Uighur Khan's head. Thereupon all his chieftains fled, and the Kirghiz ruler captured his camp, and the golden tent of the Chinese Kum chu or princess, whither he was accustomed to retire, and appropriated his treasures. He also captured the Kum chu of Thai ho, i.e. the Chinese princess so called, and transported her to the south of the mountains Ya lao, also called Tu pu; they are distant, we read, fifteen journeys on horseback from the ancient capital of the Uighurs, i.e. from Karakorum (id. 79).\n\nKnowing that the Kum chu was a daughter of the Chinese emperor, the Kirghiz chief sent an embassy with an escort to conduct her to the Chinese court. They were waylaid, however, en route by the Uighur Khan, who put the Kirghiz envoys to death. In 844, the chief of the Kirghiz, having learnt of the death of his envoys, sent Chughu ho su to inform the Chinese emperor of what had happened. He was three years en route, and was received with special honour, the emperor placing him before the ambassador of the kingdom of Polhai, and it was ordered that the genealogy of the\nKirghiz chief should be recorded alongside of that of the imperial family. The Uighurs were at this time being hard pressed by the Chinese troops, and their chief, Ukiai, retired among the He che tse Tartars or Black Wagon Tartars on the borders of Manchuria (Visdelou, op. cit. pp. 70, 80).\n\nIt would seem that the Kirghises now occupied the old country of the Uighurs, and we read that their chief proposed to the Chinese emperor to pursue and capture the Uighur Khan, in the autumn, when the horses were in good condition (id. p. 80). Meanwhile, however, the Uighur chief was put to death by the He che tse (id. p. 70).\n\nThe Chinese emperor at this time was called Tham yitsum. He proposed to send envoys to the chief of the Kirghises, offering to give him the official title of Khan, with the further Chinese style of Tum im hium yu chim mim Khan, but died before his envoys could set out. His successor was persuaded to put off carrying this out, inasmuch as it was supposed it would inflate the pride of the Kirghises, as it had previously done that of the Uighurs. He eventually however sent Li ye, President of the Tribunal of Embassies, to confer on the Kirghiz chief the title already named.\n\nDuring the reign of Tham yitsum, from 860 to 874, three embassies went from the Kirghises to the Chinese, after which the Chinese historians mention no more such embassies, nor the fortunes of the Kirghiz chiefs (id. p. 80). We read elsewhere how seven hordes of the Shi wei (by whom in this instance apparently the Mongols are meant), having appropriated and divided among them a considerable number of the fugitive Uighurs, the Kirghiz were offended, and sent one of their chiefs with 70,000 horsemen, who fell on the Shi wei, rescued the Uighurs, and then returned home (id. p. 70).\n\nWe get some other details from other sources. Thus De Guignes, quoting the Lie tai ki su, tells us expressly that in the year 842 the Khan of the Kirghiz occupied the greater part of the country which had been subject to the Uighurs; inter alia Gan si, Pe thing, and the country of the Tartars (?). He offered the Chinese Emperor a present of two beautiful\nhorses. The latter wished to ask for the restoration to the empire of Gan si and Pe thing, but he was persuaded by his ministers that their remote situation made them a burden rather than otherwise. An officer was appointed to watch the affairs of the Kirghiz. The Khan presently asked permission to be allowed to attack the Uighurs and to settle at Karakorum, which had been their capital. This was in 844. In the year 863 he asked for copies of the Chinese classics, and shortly after for the calendar (De Guignes, vol. ii. pp. 504\u2013505). In the Kang mu the story is told very much the same way, and we read that the Kirghiz, having killed the Khan of the Uighurs, obliged them to fly from their country and to seek shelter at Tien te, on the Chinese frontier, whence they made continual attacks on the frontier, and were at last defeated and forced to fly eastwards to the He che tse (De Mailla, vol. vi. pp. 475 and 483). The same author confirms the statements about Gan si and Pe thing, which no doubt remained in the hands of the Kirghises (id. 484). We read further in the Kang mu that in the year 844 the Kirghiz sent an envoy to ask that their country should be created a kingdom, but it was not thought prudent to do this without first verifying the report that their ruler was descended from Li kuang. An envoy was sent to make inquiries, who on his return reported favourably of the generosity, bravery, and goodness of the Kirghiz, and especially praised their chief for the way he had received him, and further reported that according to the documents shown to him there could be no doubt he was descended from Li kuang, through the brave Li ling. Thereupon the Imperial diploma was sent to him, appointing him Khakan with the style of Yu u ching ming (id. 488). These extracts complete and apparently make quite certain the identification, on other grounds, of the Kirais, contemporary with Chinghiz Khan, with the Kirghiz. They prove that the latter, in the second half of the ninth century, were occupying the very country of the Kirais, with the same capital of Karakorum, and with their settlements reaching the Chinese frontier, and including the districts of Gan si and Pe thing.\nWe know of no revolution of any kind which intervened and which could have dispossessed them of this country, and we may therefore rest assured that the Kirais whose history we are tracing invaded and settled in their new country about the year 840, and there founded a powerful state. As we have seen, they disappear from the Chinese annals about the year 870, when the frontier troubles of the Empire, and especially the growth of the power of the Khitans, interfered with the intercourse between China and the frontier tribes. They doubtless became subject to the Khitans at the end of the tenth century. It was shortly after the conquests of the Kitan ruler Apaokhi, that, in the year 1007 A.D., we read, as I have already stated, of the conversion of the Keret by the Nestorians. In regard to this conversion, it is well to realize what a centre and focus of Nestorian influence Tangut and its neighbourhood were. Marco Polo is a very good authority for the fact. Speaking of Cam pi chu, i.e. the modern city of Kanchau, he says, \"It is the principal town of Tangut,\" and he continues, \"its inhabitants are idolaters, Saracens (i.e. Muhammadans), and Christians, which Christians have in this city three large and beautiful churches. Five days' east of Cam pi chu is Erguiul, a province of Tangut. Its people also are Nestorian Christians, idolaters, and those who worship Mahomet. South-east of Erguiul is Singu (i.e. Si ngan fu), also in Tangut, where are also some Christians.\" This is the town where the celebrated Nestorian inscription of the seventh century, written in Syriac characters, which has been much written about, was found. Again eight days' journey west of Erguiul was Egrigaia, another province of Tangut, where there were also Christians. In its capital, Calachan (i.e. Alashan), were five churches belonging to the Nestorian Christians. These passages suffice to show, what perhaps is hardly necessary, that Nestorian Christianity was a very active faith in the north-western borders of China in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.\n\nThe next notice we have of the Kirghises is in the account of the western flight of Yeliu Taishi, the founder of the\nEmpire of Kara Khitai, who is said, in the Chinese narrative, to have escaped first to the Kirghises and then to the Uighurs, and finally arrived in Turkestan (Bretschneider, Medi\u00e6val Researches, vol. i. p. 225). This can only, it seems to me, mean that the Kirais are identified in the narrative with the Kirghises. Yeliu Taishi subsequently sent an expedition against the Kirghises (id. 229), which may mean either against the Kirais or the Kirghises of the Irtish.\n\nWe will now turn to the history of the Kirais as preserved by the historians of the Mongols.\n\nThe first chief of the race recorded by Rashid-ud-din was called Merghuz Khan. He was also styled Merghuz Buirukh. Merghuz has been very generally identified with the Christian name Mark. At this time we are told the Tartars were very powerful and no longer obeyed either the Chinese or the Jurjis, i.e. the tribes of Manchuria. The Tartars about lake Buyur had a chief named Nor Buyuruk Khan, which name means Khan of Lake Buyur. Erdmann in one place by mistake calls them Naimans, who lived a long way off. Berezine has the passage right.\n\nNor Buyuruk, we are told, captured Merghuz, the chief of the Kirais, and sent him prisoner to the chief of the Jurjis, who put him to death by nailing him down to a wooden ass. Presently the widow of Merghuz (named, according to Berezine, Khutuktai Erekchi, Erdmann calls her Khutukti Hargeji, Rashid says the name means bright and lively) sent word to the Tartar chief that she wished to give him a feast. He accepted the invitation, and she duly provided a hundred sheep, ten oxen, and a hundred great skins of kumiz, wheeled on carts. The skins, instead of containing drink, however, concealed a number of armed men, who at the feast cut their way out and killed the Tartar chief and his companions (Rashid\u2019s Prolegomena, translated by Erdmann, Temujin der Unersch\u00fctterliche, pp. 232, 233, Berezine, vol. i. pp. 96, 97).\n\nMerghuz Buirukh left two sons, Khurchakuz Buirukh (Yuan chao pi shi, pp. 91, 92, D\u2019Ohsson, vol. i. p. 50, Erd-\nmannu, p. 233), and Gurkhan, whom Rashid is careful to distinguish from his contemporary the Gurkhan of Kara Khitai.\n\nKhurehakuz, according to the Yuan chao pi shi, had forty sons. Of these the names of five are recorded, namely, Tughril or Toghril, called Toli by the Chinese, whose history will occupy us at some length; Erke Kara, Tai Timur or Bai Timur, Buka Timur, and Ilkha Sankun or Sangun, who bore the Tibetan name of Jakhanbo, derived, according to Rashid-ud-din, from Tibetan Ja \u2018country\u2019 and Khanbo \u2018great chief.\u2019 Khanbo is probably the Dsanbo which occurs in so many Tibetan names.\n\nGurkhan outlived his brother, and according to Eastern rule of succession was his heir. It is not improbable that he did in fact succeed to the southern part of the Kirai dominions, namely, Tenduc.\n\nWhat follows as to the earlier career of Tughril is collected chiefly from the long letter of complaint written to him by Chinghiz Khan in later days, in which he records the many services he rendered him. This is very fully reported in the Yuan chao pi shi.\n\nAccording to this authority, Tughril, when a boy of seven years old, was captured by the Merkit and made to grind grain, and when thirteen years old, he, with his mother, were seized by the Tartars and made to tend cattle (op. cit. 76). The same authority tells us that on his father\u2019s death, being the eldest, they made him ruler, and that he afterwards killed his brothers Tai Timur and Bukha Timur. He also wished to kill his third brother, Erke Kara, but he saved himself by fleeing to the Naimans (op. cit. p. 91.) Rashid-ud-din says that on their father\u2019s death the brothers sent Tughril to the frontier, and while he was absent two of them, Tai Timur and Buka Timur, usurped the throne, upon which he returned and killed them (Erdmann, Temudschin, etc. p. 233). The former authority goes on to say that Gurkhan, to revenge the death of his nephews, made war upon Tughril and compelled him, with only a few hundred men, to seek refuge in the Karaun mountains. Tughril\nthereupon betrothed his daughter, Kujaur Ujin, to Toktu, the ruler of the Merkit, who lived on the Selinga and its tributaries, in order to secure a passage through his country to that of Yessugei, the ruler of the Mongols, who lived on the Onon. Having reached the camp of Yessugei, the latter went with his people and drove Gurkhan to seek shelter at Khashin (i.e. the Mongol form of the Chinese Ho Si, meaning the district west of the Yellow River, otherwise known as Tangut).\n\nThese events are reported in greater detail in a Chinese work entitled Huang y\u00fcan sheng wu ts'in cheng lu, i.e. a record of Chinghiz Khan's warlike doings, of which Palladius possessed a MS. copy, which has apparently never been printed, and of which he published a translation in the Russian Oriental Record, vol. i. 1872. This work agrees remarkably in its statements with that of Rashid-ud-din.\n\nRashid says that Gurkhan attacked his nephew in his chief camp, called Karaun Kipchak, i.e. in the Black Forest (meaning the so-called Black Forest on the river Tula, Erdmann, p. 289). The Huang yuan calls the place the defiles of Khalaun (op. cit. p. 170), while Gaubil, in his notes to the Yuan shi lei pien, gives the place at some rugged gorges in the mountains south of the river Orkhon (Gaubil, Hist. des Mongols, p. 8, note 1). Tughril was accompanied in his flight, according to Rashid-ud-din, by Udur Noyan and Bugachi (read Durpugan and Bukhasi, by Erdmann), and Yessugei in helping him marched first to Karabuka (called Khalabukhua chuga in the Huang yuan). Then crossing a mountain whose name is missing in Rashid's MSS., but is written Abujabukhuagen in the Huang yuan, then to Tulatan Tulanguti, which are written in the same way both in Rashid and the Huang yuan, and are therefore reliable names, then, according to the Huang yuan, by Tsian-sutan-lingu, the pass of Kuikun and lake Kuisaoi, Rashid says by Karaun Kipchak, i.e. the Black Forest, and Kushaurnor or lake Kushaur. Thence Yessugei marched to Kurban Talasut, where Gurkhan lived, whence he was driven, after being wounded, to seek refuge in Khashin with only twenty or\nthirty men (Berezine, vol. ii. p. 135, Erdmann, pp. 289-290, Huang yuan, p. 170). Yessugei thus restored Tughril to his people, who, he says, lived in the Black Forest on the river Tula. The two then became Anda or sworn friends (op. cit. p. 92). Palladius, the editor of the Yuan chao pi shi, says that in the Si sia shu shi or Official history of Tangut, the flight of Gurkhan is dated in 1171.\n\nAfter the death of Yessugei, his son Temujin, the future Chinghiz Khan, lost most of his supporters, and was greatly distressed. We are told that directly after his accession, being then only fourteen years old, i.e. about 1180, he went to fetch his wife home. When she returned with him she took with her a kaftan, or robe made of black sable, as a present for her mother-in-law. Temujin, who doubtless thought it might be made more useful in another way, recalled the fact that his father had once been on good terms with Tughril Khan, who was therefore likely to prove a father to him, and he determined to present him with the kaftan. He therefore rode off with his brothers to the river Tula, where Tughril lived, and told him he had brought him a present which his wife had meant for her mother-in-law. Tughril was much pleased, and said, \"I will bring your people together again, and reunite the scattered once more to you, and will treasure this in my heart\" (Yuan chao pi shi, pp. 48, 49). Petis de la Croix reports this saga from Muhammadan writers. He says that when Temujin was twenty years old, he fled from his enemies, and sought shelter with Wang Khan, that is to say, Tughril (vide infra), who was living at Karakorum, and who received him well, having heard from Kharachar Noyan, who filled the office of Chinghiz Khan's tutor, the story of his persecution by his enemies. Wang Khan promised to support him, and to bring the recalcitrant tribes which would not obey him to their duty. We are told further that he called his young friend son, placed him above the princes of the blood, committed to him the conduct of his armies in the war he had against the Khan of Tenduc (?), i.e. his uncle Gurkhan, and undertook nothing without his counsel. He also gave him his\ndaughter Wisulujin in marriage. She had been loved by Chamukha, whom she rejected in favour of his rival, and whose jealousy we are told was thus kindled. This story appears in none of the older authorities. De la Croix quotes part of it from Abulfaraj, but I can nowhere find it in his works, either in the Syriac or Arabic chronicle. In the latter there is merely the bare statement that Chinghiz married a daughter of Wang Khan. He quotes the rest from the Turkish author Abu'l-khair, who died in 1554, and who was the main authority followed by him. Von Hammer, who treats the whole account as a fable, says, however, that it is met with earlier than in the pages of Abu'l-khair, namely, in the Mokhademmei Zafar Nameh of Sherifu'd'dinah of Yezd, 1424 A.D., in Khuandemir's Habib es Siyer, and in the Tarikhi Haidari.\n\nWe next read how Temujin was hard pressed by the Merkit, who had carried off his wife. He therefore sent his brothers, Khazar and Belgutei, to the Black Forest on the river Tula to ask Tughril's help. He promised to destroy the Merkit and to restore his wife, offering to supply two Tumans, that is to say, twenty thousand men, and bade them go and inform Chamukha, the chief of the Jajirats, who would furnish another two Tumans, to form the left wing. Chamukha, on being approached, replied, \"Tell Tughril and Temujin that I have already equipped my army, let the former pass along the front of the mountain Burkhan, i.e. the chain of Kentei, and meet me in the place called Botokhan Boorehi (doubtless somewhere on the upper Onon). I have here some people belonging to Temujin. From them I will collect a tuman of warriors, and will also take a tuman of my own, and with these two we will go up the river Onon to the place Botokhan Boorchi, where we will unite.\" After this he began to move. Tughril also set out for Temujin's hunting ground. He was accompanied by his brother Jakhanbo, and they met Temujin on the banks of the Kimurka, or Tsimurka, which, according to Palladius, is an affluent of the Onon. When they reached the place at the sources of the river Onon where they had agreed to meet Chamukha, he had already\nbeen waiting there three days, and angrily complained at their not keeping their appointment. Tughril conciliated him, and they set out together for the river Kilho (no doubt the tributary of the Selinga, so called in the map attached to De Mailla, and otherwise known as the Khilok). They crossed it by a bridge made out of a plant called the pig\u2019s bristle, plaited into cords and arrived at the Buura (very likely the little river Buura falling into the Selinga south of the Chikoi). There they seized the wives and people of Tokhtu, chief of the Merkit. After their campaign the three allies returned home by way of Talkhini Aral, which, we are told, was situated between the Orkhon and the Selinga. Thence Tughril, going behind the mountain Burkhan, passed the three places Khokortu-jurbu, Kachauratu-subchit, and Khuliyatu-subchit, and occupying himself with hunting, eventually reached the river Tula (Yuan chao pi shi, pp. 54-57).\n\nWe now reach a notable event in the lives both of Tughril and of Temujin. The Tartars (i.e. the tribes properly so called living on the borders of Manchuria), having revolted against the Kin Emperor, who ruled over Northern China, Temujin, who had a private grudge to revenge since some of his relatives had been treacherously undone by them, suggested to his friend and patron, Tughril, who, as we have seen, had a similar grudge, that they should help the Kin Emperor. Tughril agreed, and in three days was ready and had set out. They advanced along the river Ulja and captured a Tartar fortress at a place called Khusutu Suiltuyan, and killed the Tartar leader, Megujin Suultu, and others (Yuan chao pi shi). The Kin general was much pleased with his allies, and, we are told, gave each of them a title. Tughril was rewarded, we read, with the title of Wang or prince (Yuan chao pi shi, pp. 66, 67, and notes, Yuan shi, Erdmann, p. 267, D\u2019Ohsson, vol. i. p. 46). Thenceforward he is generally referred to as Wang Khan.\n\nWe are told in the Yuan chao pi shi, that in the year of the Hen, i.e. in the year 1201 A.D., the Ulus Khatagin and others, to the number of eleven altogether, assembled at Alkhuibulaa, and after consultation agreed to ask Chamukha,\ni.e. the chief of the Jajirats, to be their head. Having killed a horse and sworn a pact, they set off along the river Argun, and at the island of the river Kan Muran they proclaimed Chamukha as their ruler. They gave him the title of Gurkhan, and decided to make war upon Chinghiz and Wang Khan. First, let us consider the locality of these proceedings. The Alkhuibulaa of the above notice is called Arubulak in the Yuan shi as translated by Hyacinthe, and the Alai Springs in Mr. Douglas\u2019s translation. It is clear it was near the Argun, and I am disposed to identify it with the Uro-bulak, which falls into the Argun near New Zurukhaitu. Palladius quotes a suggestion of a Chinese commentator that it is a feeder of the Argun called Imu, which at its outfall is called Jou, i.e. island. I would remark that a river falling into the Argun on its right bank near New Zurukhaitu, almost opposite the Urobulak, is called Gan or Han. In the Yuan shi this river is said to be in the district of Kulanergi, i.e. the Red Cliffs. Hyacinthe reads this last name Tula-biri, i.e. the river Tula, while Gaubil gives it from the Yuan shi lei pien as Tulu-pir, and identifies it with the Toropira, a tributary of the Nonni in Northern Manchuria. I prefer to follow Palladius\u2019s reading. All the accounts agree in fixing upon the Argun and its tributaries as the scene of the adventure. Having fixed the locality, let us now try and discriminate who the confederates were who sided with Chamukha. In the Chinese translation of the Yuan chao pi shi these are given as \u201cthe Khatagin with others, eleven Ulusses altogether;\u201d but in the original Mongol text, according to Palladius, the names are set out as follows: The Katagins, Sajiu (i.e. Saljiut), Durben Tartar, Tatalun (?), Ikilesun (Inkirasscs), Ungila (the Kongurut), Kholola (Khorlos), Naiman, Merkit, Uirad, and Taijut. Palladius says very truly that only some of these tribes, namely, the Katagins, Saljiut, Taijut, and Uirad, were of Mongol blood. Rashid-ud-din tell us the chiefs of the alliance, beside Chamukha, were Buirukh, the leader of the Naimans, Tokhtu of the Merkit, Ukhutu Bahadur of the Kongurut, and Khotugabeki of the Uirad.\nTo revert to the Yuan chao pi shi. When Chinghiz Khan and Wang Khan heard of the formidable alliance, they advanced down the river Kerulon. Chinghiz sent on three of his relatives to reconnoitre, and Wang Khan similarly sent his son Sankun with two companions. Presently the enemy was encountered at a place called Koitian, which was apparently situated near the Dalai lake, and we are told that during the fight the chiefs of the Naimans and the Uirad proceeded with their incantations to cause wind and snow and rain; but, contrary to their expectations, the elements went against their own people. The air became dark, and Chamukha's people, not being able to see, fell into holes. He thereupon said that heaven was unpropitious, and his army scattered (Yuan chao pi shi, pp. 70, 71). Chamukha withdrew along the river Argun, which, with the Onon, are the head streams of the Amur. He was pursued by Wang Khan, who is next said to have assisted Chinghiz Khan in crushing and subduing the Taijut, a Mongol tribe living on the river Onon (Rashid-ud-din, ed. Berezine, pp. 118, 119, Erdmann, p. 275, D'Ohsson, vol. i. pp. 59, 60). We have seen how Wang Khan on his accession killed two of his brothers, and how a third fled to the Naimans. We are now told that Inanj, the chief of the Naimans, collected an army and drove him away. He thereupon fled to the Khoikhoi or Muhammadans, and then sought shelter with the Gurkhan of Kara Khitai, whom he found on the river Chui, which is still well known. In less than a year he quarrelled with the Gurkhan, and returned once more to Mongolia through the country of the Uighurs and Tangutans. On this journey, according to the Yuan chao pi shi, he lived on the milk of five ewes, and also drank the blood of a camel, which he obtained by piercing its body, and rode on a blind and lame horse (op. cit. p. 92). The Huang yuan says he tied the ewes with a cord; it also says he boiled the blood he got from the camel for food. He made his way to the camp of Chinghiz Khan at Guser (a feeder of the Onon is still called Aguza). Chinghiz Khan, in consequence of the old attachment which bound him to his friend, sent the\nbrave Sukiga to meet him. The Huang yuan says he sent his relatives Takhaya and Syuegaya. He presently set out himself to the heights above the Kerulon. Having met Wang Khan, he conducted him to his own camp, and ordered his people to supply him with food. They spent the winter together at the place called Khubakha, already mentioned. About this time, while Tughril was with him, Chinghiz Khan had an expedition against the Merkit and defeated one of their tribes, the Udut, west of the mountain Khadin khi, in the district of Munuyuli. He obtained much cattle, and many loads of booty, which he gave to his friend. Rashid-ud-din calls the place where the struggle with the Merkit took place Berezobie Kholm, or, as Erdmann reads it, Beshmeh Fatilikh, behind Murichak Mual (Huang yuan, pp. 170, 171, Berezine, vol. ii. pp. 136, 137, Erdmann, p. 290, D\u2019Ohsson, vol. i. pp. 74, 75). According to the Huang yuan, Chinghiz conducted his friend to the Black Forest on the Tula, where they formed an alliance as father and son (op. cit. p. 159). It would seem that Wang Khan was now reinstated in power, doubtless by the influence of Chinghiz Khan (Yuan chao pi shi, p. 77). His truculent disposition presently broke out again however, and we are told that his brother Jakhanbo and nobles concerted together and recalled his various acts of tyranny, and that he still had evil designs against them. Their conversation was reported to him by one named Altun Ashukh. He thereupon, according to the Yuan chao pi shi, seized three of the leaders, Elkhutura, Khulbar, and Arintaishi. Jakhanbo alone escaped, and found shelter with the Naimans. The other three were tied together and had cangues or wooden collars fastened on their shoulders. Wang Khan reproached them, saying, \u201cWhen we were passing through the country of Uighur and Tangut, what did you promise?\u201d He then ordered those present to spit in their faces, and afterwards set them at liberty (Yuan chao pi shi, p. 77). The Yuan shi, which reports this story, makes Cha-si-gami-bu, as Hyacinthe reads the name, the chief conspirator, and tells us that Wang Khan reproached Ekertor, and reminded him of\nthe oath of friendship they had made in returning from Hosi. It also says that Ekertor accompanied Jakhanbo to the Naimans (Douglas, pp. 26, 27, Hyacinthe, p. 19, De Mailla, tome ix. pp. 23, 24). The story here related is also told in the Huang yuan, and by Rashid-ud-din, which authorities so frequently agree. They state that it was in winter or at the approach of winter, when Wang Khan was moving with his army from the Kerulon towards the mountain Khuba Khaiya (Huang yuan, p. 162, Berezine, p. 121, Erdmann reads it Khuta Khias, op. cit. p. 277, and D'Ohsson Kurta Kaya, vol. i. p. 62), that his brother Jakhanbo concerted a revolt with four Kirai generals. Rashid-un-din calls them Altun Ashuk, Il Khutur, Il Khunkgur, and Kulburu (Berezine, p. 121). He said to them that his brother was of an intolerable character, unfortunate in his undertakings, fickle in his plans, and that he had so tyrannized over his relatives that the greater part of them had already sought refuge in Kara Khitai, and there was no ulus which he had not trampled upon. Why should we stay with him? Altun Ashuk repeated these words to Wang Khan, who ordered Il Khutur and Il Khunkgur to be brought before him in chains. He reminded the former of the oath he had sworn as they were travelling together from Tangut, and, according to the Huang yuan, he spat in his face, and all got up and spat too. He also bitterly reproached Jakhanbo, who however escaped to the Naimans, accompanied by Il Khutur, Il Khunkgur, Narin Tughril, and Alin Taishi, called Tolin Taishi in the Huang yuan. Jakhanbo informed Tayang Khan of the Naimans how he had been treacherously treated by Altun Ashuk, and asked permission to enter his service (Berezine, vol. ii. pp. 121, 122, Erdmann, pp. 277, 278, Huang yuan, p. 163).\n\nAfter this Wang Khan wintered at Khubakha, and Chinghiz Khan in the mountains Cheeher situated at the lower end of the Kerulon, and some time after we find Jakhanbo joining Chinghiz while the latter was encamped at Tersu. The two were closely united by a series of marriages. One of Jakhanbo's daughters, named Abaka or Abika, was married to\nChinghiz Khan himself; a second, called Begtutemish, married his eldest son Juchi; and the third, Siurkukteni bigi, married his youngest son Tului, and became the mother of the Khakans Mangu and Khubilai (Rashid-ud-din, quoted in Quatrem\u00e8re, Hist. des Mongols de la Perse, pp. 85\u201391, and notes).\n\nIn the year of the dog, i.e. 1202, Wang Khan fought against the Merkit, and pursued their chief Tokhtu to Barguchin Tokum (Yuan chao pi shi, p. 80). Palladius suggests that by Tokum a wide fissure on the lower Selinga is meant (op. cit. p. 259). The Huang yuan says it was on the river Ula (? the Uda), and Rashid-ud-din at Bukher gereh (? the plains of the Buura, a tributary of the Selinga). He also killed Togusibek, Tokhtu\u2019s eldest son, made his two other sons, Khudu and Chilaun, surrender with their tribes, and captured the Khatuns Khudutai and Chalikhun, wives of Tokhtu, his brother and his two daughters, and subdued the Udut, a tribe of the Merkit people. On this occasion we are expressly told Wang Khan did not reciprocate Chinghiz Khan\u2019s former generosity, nor did he give him any of the plunder (Yuan shi, tr. Hyacinthe, p. 16, Douglas, Genghiz Khan, pp. 21, 22, De Mailla, vol. ix. p. 20, Huang yuan, p. 160, Berezine, vol. ii. p. 111, Erdmann, p. 271, and notes 76, 77, D\u2019Ohsson, vol. i. p. 55).\n\nAfter this campaign Wang Khan and Chinghiz fought jointly against the Naimans and their chief Guchu gudun Buirukh, who, we are told, was then living in the district of Ulughtagh (doubtless the Chinese Altai and its continuation, the Kuku Sirkha ula), and on the river Siao khokh (? the Sirkha gol, south of the Sirkha ula). De Mailla says on the plain of Hesiupasi. Not feeling strong enough to oppose the allies, the Naiman chief crossed the Altai, i.e. the so-called Ektag Altai, and went to a place called Khumshiugir on the river Urungu (i.e. the river still so called which falls into lake Kizilbash). One of Chinghiz Khan\u2019s men captured a Naiman chief named Yeditublukh, whose saddle-girths broke, while their Khan, Buirukh, himself was pursued to lake Kizilbash, where he died (Yuan chao pi shi, p. 80). Yeditu-\nblukh is called Ycti tobu by De Mailla, Oshu Boro in the Kienlung edition of the Yuan shi, and Yedito bohy in the Huang yuan. One account says he had gone to reconnoitre on a scarped mountain when his saddle turned round and he was captured (Hyacinthc, p. 16, Douglas, p. 22, De Mailla, vol. i. p. 160, Huang yuan, p. 160). Rashid calls him Ede Tughluk, which he says means one knowing seven sciences, while Von Hammer explains it as one having seven banners or commanding seven squadrons (Berezine, vol. ii. pp. 112, 113, Erdmann, pp. 271, 272, note 81, Von Hammer, Gesch. des Gold. Horde, p. 62, note 8). Rashid-ud-din makes Buirukh escape to the Kirghises and Kemkemjuts, i.e. to the Black Irtish.\n\nMeanwhile, however, a feud arose between the two allies which was caused by Chamukha, chief of the Jajirats, and Chinghiz Khan's mortal enemy. He suggested that the latter was having secret communications with the Naimans. He then saluted Wang Khan as Khakan or Emperor, and said, \"I am like the ever-present lark,\\(^1\\) but Kungur is like the migratory swallow which returns in the summer towards the south.\" For this he was rebuked by a man who is named Gurin Baatur, from Ubchukhtai, in the Yuan chao pi shi, and Ujir Kurin Baghadur, or, as Erdmann reads it, Bahriti gurin Baghadur, by Rashid (Yuan chao pi shi, pp. 80, 81, Berezine, vol. ii. p. 114, Erdmann, p. 272).\n\nThe effect of it was that Wang Khan and Chamukha both lit a number of fires and decamped. The former withdrew along the river Asauli or Asiul, called Khasuilu in the Huang yuan, which is no doubt correctly identified with the Hasui, a tributary of the Selinga, by Gaubil (Gaubil, Genghiz Khan, p. 7, notes 1 and 2, Yuan chao pishi, p. 80). While Chinghiz Khan and Wang Khan were engaged on their campaign, a Naiman general named Keksiu Sabrakh (Rashid-ud-din says he was called Sabrakh, and was surnamed Gugsu or Kuksu, meaning in Turkish a pain in the chest) apparently\n\n\\(^1\\) Palladius says the larks in Mongolia are stationary. The Yuan shi uses the snow-bunting and the wild goose for its illustrations.\nmade a raid upon the camp and effects of Wang Khan's brothers and relatives. This was at a place called in the Yuan chao pi shi, Baidarakh Belchur (doubtless Baidarik, on the river Baidarik, which rises in the Kuku Daban range and falls into lake Chaghan, see map of Western Mongolia, Petermann's Mittheilungen, 1872). Rashid says it was so called from a princess of the Ongut named Bai Barakh (? Bai Darakh), who married a Naiman chief at Belchira (Berezine, vol. ii. p. 113, Erdmann, note 83).\n\nWhen Chinghiz Khan found that his ally had gone, he said, \"He has forsaken me, deceiving me by lighting these fires as if he were going to cook some food.\" He in turn withdrew, and marching by the defile of Yetir Altai, he reached his quarters of Sari Keher on the Onon in safety (Yuan chao pi shi, p. 81). Wang Khan was not so lucky as his friend, for we are told that Keksiu Sabrakh pursued him on his retreat, seized the wives of his son Sankun, and captured one half of his people and cattle in the defile of Tiligetu, on the frontier of the Naimans and Kirais. Khudu and Chilaun, the two sons of Tokhtu, chief of the Merkit, also abandoned the Kirai chief and went down the Selinga to rejoin their father (Yuan chao pi shi, p. 81). Wang Khan was now in desperate circumstances, and he deemed it prudent to send to Chinghiz Khan, whom he had recently treated so badly, and to bid him send his four famous generals, Boghorji, Mukhuli, Buraghul, and Khilaun, to his assistance. They were styled Kuesie. Chinghiz complied with his friend's request. Before the arrival of the four braves, Sankun had begun a struggle at Khulaankhut(?). Sankun's horse was wounded in the leg during the fight, and he was about to be captured, when the four heroes arrived and rescued him, and also recovered his wives and people. Rashid-ud-din tells us that in the battle which Sankun fought with the Naimans on this occasion, the two Kirai generals, Tekinkuri and Iturken Yadakhu, were both killed. Boghorji gave Sankun his own charger, and himself mounted the famous grey horse which Chinghiz Khan had given him, with injunctions that he must not strike it, but only stroke it\nwith his riding whip, when he wished it to fly like lightning. Wang Khan was deeply grateful, and we are told he rewarded Boghorji with a present of a set of robes and ten golden cups. According to the Yuan chao pi shi, when Wang Khan heard of what Chinghiz Khan had done for him, he said, \"Formerly his good father set free and restored me my people whom I had lost; now the son sends four champions who release and restore to me my people. I swear by the shielding power (or aid) of heaven I will try and repay this obligation.\" He then went on to say that he was growing old, that his younger brothers were unworthy to succeed him, and that he only had one son, Sankun, of whom he spoke disparagingly, saying it was the same as if he did not exist. \"I will consider Temujin as the elder, so that I shall have two sons when I am at rest,\" and he accordingly met Chinghiz Khan at the Black Forest on the river Tula, and adopted him as his son. Hitherto Chinghiz had called him father merely out of respect, and because of his friendship with Yessugei. Now they made a bond of father and son, and declared, \"In the struggles with our foes we will fight side by side; in hunting the wild animals we will unite together. If people try to make us quarrel, we will not listen to them, nor believe them until we have had mutual explanations, and spoken about matters face to face.\" In order to secure this friendship still further, Chinghiz asked for the hand of Wang Khan's daughter Chaurbiki for his son Juchi, while he offered his own daughter Khojin to Sankun's son Tusakhi, called Kushbuka by the western writers (Erdmann, p. 441). Sankun, who deemed his people superior to the Mongols, and looked upon Chinghiz Khan as belonging to an inferior horde to himself, expressed his feelings thus: \"When the maiden of our house goes into theirs, she will stand behind the door with her face to the north\" (i.e. in the attitude of a servant or slave), \"while if their maiden comes to us, she will sit with her face to the south\" (i.e. in the position of a mistress). He therefore objected to the two matches, which were broken off, thereby naturally causing some heartburning to the proud Mongol chief. This notice may be com-\npared with that given by Marco Polo, in whose words the story runs as follows: \"In the year of Christ 1200, Chinghiz Khan sent an embassy to Prester John, and desired to have his daughter to wife. But when Prester John heard that Chinghiz Khan demanded his daughter in marriage, he waxed very wroth, and said to the envoys, 'What impudence is this to ask my daughter to wife? Wist he not well that he was my liegeman and serf? Get ye back to him and tell him that I had liefer set my daughter in the fire than give her in marriage to him, and that he deserves death at my hand, rebel and traitor that he is.' So he bade the envoys begone at once and never come into his presence again. The envoys on receiving this reply departed straightway and made haste to their master, and related all that Prester John had ordered them to say, keeping nothing back.\" Marco Polo, it will be seen, says nothing of Sankun, and attributes \"the proud words\" to Wang Khan himself. In the Yuan shi, which says the betrothals were broken off amidst angry and fierce words, Juchi is called Jotsin or Chotsin, and Wang Khan's daughter Chanurh Pe-tsi, while Chinghiz Khan's daughter is called Koh tsin Petsi or Gatsin Petsi, and her proposed husband To-sze-ho or Toskho. De Mailla's authority tells us that Temujin having asked the hand of Wang Khan's daughter Serpechu for his eldest son Juchi, and been refused, some time after revenged himself by refusing the hand of his daughter Hoakin to Wang Khan's son Tosaho. In the Huang yuan we are told that when these negociations for alternate marriages were in progress, Chinghiz was encamped at the mountain Abuli Kyaekhoger, and Wang Khan in the sandy desert of Tsu-belik.\n\nThe coolness created by the failure of these negociations was taken advantage of and fanned by Chamukha. He first aroused Altan and other relatives of Chinghiz Khan's, with whom he had had a quarrel about the division of the booty in the recent struggle with the Tartars, and then went on to have a consultation with Sankun, who was encamped at Berkeeli on the north side of the Checher ondur near the Kcrulon. He declared that Chinghiz was carrying on a furtive correspon-\ndence with Tayang Khan of the Naimans all the while that he seemed so frank. Sankun having heard what Chamukha and the others had to say, sent Saikantodayah to inform his father. Wang Khan asked why they should distrust the Mongol chief, adding that heaven would not shield them if they cherished ill feelings towards him, and he characterized the language of Chamukha as deceitful and unworthy of belief. Sankun sent a second messenger to assure his father that the charges were in everybody's mouth. The latter was still unconvinced. He therefore determined to go in person, and declared that if, while Wang Khan was still living, Temujin could treat them thus cavalierly, was it likely that after he was dead he would allow him, Sankun, to rule over the people which had been brought together with such pains by his father and uncle? Wang Khan still urged his former arguments until, noticing that Sankun was displeased, and was going away, he called him back and said, \"Apparently heaven is not propitious. Have your way as you wish\" (Yuan chao pi shi, pp. 83-85).\n\nRashid-ud-din, in reporting these events, describes how at this time the people of Chinghiz Khan and of Sankun were mingled together like butter and milk, and the latter kept a close watch upon his rival, so that he should not escape him; but some suspicion seems to have crossed the mind of Chinghiz Khan, for he gradually drew his people away. Sankun began in turn to fear that his plans might miscarry, and in the spring of the Swine's year, 1203, despatched another messenger to his father. Rashid does not mention Sankun himself as having had an interview, but, according to him, it was to this messenger that Wang Khan gave his answer. He says that the latter explained to him how he and Temujin (i.e. Chinghiz) had been anda or sworn friends, how he had owed his life to him, how his hair and beard were growing grey, and his bones needed repose, how he wished to die peaceably, and how, if they were determined to carry out their plans, they must do it without him, and must separate themselves from him (Erdmann, Temujin, pp. 283-285).\nLet us now revert to the Yuan chao pi shi. We there read that after Sankun had received his father's answer, he took counsel with his companions and urged, that as Chinghiz had been anxious to ally himself with his sister Chaurbeki, i.e. by marrying his son Juchi to her, it would be well to fix a day and invite him to the betrothal feast, and that on his arrival they might seize him. He accordingly sent a man to invite him. Chinghiz set out with ten companions. On the way he stayed the night in the yurt of an old man named Munlik. The latter reminded him that when he had formerly courted them, the Kirais, in their pride, refused his advances; what motive could they have in asking him now? It was better to refuse, and to make the excuse that in spring the horses are lean, and that they were then in their pastures. Chinghiz took this advice, and sent Bukhataya to the feast and himself went home again (Yuan chao pi shi, p. 85). The Huang yuan calls the messenger sent by Sankun to invite him to the feast, Bukhuataikicha. Rashid-ud-din calls him Ukdaya Kunjat, he is named Bukdai Kunjat by Abulghazi. Ukdai was accompanied, according to Rashid, by Bekit Tudan (Erdmann, op. cit. p. 285). When Sankun found that his messengers returned without Chinghiz, he suspected that his plot had been discovered, and determined to try and surprise him, and the best plan of doing so was resolved upon at a consultation. Ekecheryan, the younger brother of Altan, who had attended this council, in returning home, began to talk carelessly, and said, \"The assembly has determined that we depart to-morrow to seize Temujin; if some one were to inform him to-day, I don't know how he would reward him.\" His wife Alakhait said, \"Do not speak unguardedly. The domestics may overhear you and accept your words as really meant.\" At this time Badia, a horse-herd, who had brought in mares' milk, having overheard the words, returned and reported what had been said to his comrade, Kishlikh. The latter said, \"I will go and listen further,\" and going into the yurt he noticed that Nurin Kayan, the son of Ekecheryan, was sharpening arrows, and he heard his father warn him against letting the servants know what they were going to do.\nEkecheryan ordered Kishlikh to go and catch a mottled horse, as he wished to depart the following morning. Kishlikh returned to his companion, and said he had confirmed his report, and the two determined to go and warn Chinghiz. Having caught and tethered two horses, they went into their yurt, and dressed a lamb in a fire made from the wood nari, and setting out arrived the same night at Temujin\u2019s dwelling, and reported what they had overheard. The latter, having consulted with his people, forsook his camp, and hastily retired to the north of the mountain Mao-undur, i.e. the Bad Mountain. Having ordered Jelmi to go and reconnoitre, he the next day reached Khalakhaljitelet (Yuan chao pi shi, pp. 85, 86). This is the Khalaljin Alat or hills of Khalaljin of Rashid-ud-din. To revert to our main authority. After Jelmi had gone out to reconnoitre, a herdsman of Alchidai, named Chigdai, arrived with his companions to say that from the mountain Mao-undur and from the direction of the camp Khulaanburakhat dust could be seen, and that the foe was advancing. Chinghiz took horse and rode on. At this time Wang Khan arrived, and asked Chamukha what troops Chinghiz had with him. He replied, the two hordes Uruut and Mankhut; that his warriors and that his positions were well taken, and that his standards were either coloured or black. Wang Khan said that it would be well to take heed when they hove in sight. He ordered that the brave Khadakhgi of the horde Jirgin should first advance, then the brave Achikhshirun with the tribes Tuman Tubigan, Oman and Dunkhait. Then Khari-shilimuntaiji with a thousand body-guards, and lastly, his own army corps. Wang Khan also entrusted Chamukha with the chief command. The latter sent secretly to inform Chinghiz of this, and to tell him that, as he had control of affairs, he should take care the Kirais did not win. When Chinghiz got this news, he proposed to the old man Jurchidai to be his commander-in-chief, but meanwhile Khuidar stepped forward and said, \u201cI will be the leader, take care of my orphans.\u201d Jurchidai said, \u201cThe Uruut and Mankhut will fight in front before the Emperor,\u201d and he accordingly\nput them in array before Chinghiz. He had hardly done so when the first division of the Kirais, the Jirgins, came up. The Uruut and Mankhut smote them. While they were pursuing this division they were attacked by another section of the enemy, commanded by Archikhshilun, of the tribe Tumayan Tubigan, who had a personal encounter with the Mongol leader Khuildar, and dragged him from his horse. His men were, however, defeated by the Uruut, led by Jurchidai, who, still advancing, encountered the clans Oman and Dunkhait, and also smote them. Shilemintaitsi, with the thousand body-guards, was also defeated. Things were going badly with the Kirais, and we read that Sankun, without his father's knowledge, threw himself into the fray. One of Jurchidai's arrows struck him in the cheek, and he fell, whereupon his men retired and gathered round him. Chinghiz having been successful in this struggle, which was apparently a preliminary skirmish rather than a decided battle, and seeing it was already late, collected his men and ordered Khuildar to be carried away. During the night he moved on, and at length encamped far from the battle-field (Yuan chao pi shi, p. 88).\n\nPalladius tells us that in the biography of Jurchidai, appended to the Yuan chao pi shi, it is reported that the Kolis, i.e. the Kirais, the Khalakhachins (?), and the Shato, i.e. the so-called Desert Turks, attacked the people of Chinghiz, whereupon the latter's near relative Khuildar urged that the matter would not brook delay, and that he must summon the brave people of Jurchidai. Jurchidai accordingly assailed the enemy, shot Sankun, and smote the leader of the Shilimin and others. In the life of Khuildar, in the same work, we read that in this fight the army of the Ulu (i.e. the Uruut) was ordered to move to the front but its leader, Juchitai (sic), putting his whip across his horse's mane, did not respond. Khuildar thereupon entrusting his three yellow-haired children to Chinghiz Khan's care, attacked the enemy and received some wounds in the head (Yuan chao pi shi, note 296). According to the same authority, the day after the battle, at daybreak, Chinghiz mustered his men and\ncalled the roll-call. He found that three of his famous warriors were missing, Okotai (probably his third son Ogotai, who must then have been quite a boy), Borokhul or Burgbul, and Boorehu or Boghorji. Chinghiz remarked that Ogotai had lived with the other two and they had died together, not wishing to be separated. Fearing a fresh attack, he kept his men well together, and presently a man was seen coming from the battle-field who proved to be Boorehu. Chinghiz made an exclamation suggesting that all was over, when Boorehu reported that during the fight his horse had been shot by the enemy and he was dismounted; but when the Kirais gathered round Sankun, he caught a runaway horse on which he had escaped. Presently there arrived a second horseman, and, as he drew near, they noticed that two other legs besides his own were hanging down. The new arrivals proved to be Ogotai and Borokhul, riding on one horse. The latter's mouth was smeared with blood, for he had sucked the clotted blood from an arrow-wound in Ogotai's neck. Chinghiz wept, had the wound seared, and gave Ogotai something to relieve his thirst. Borokhul reported that there was a large dust where the enemy were, and they were apparently retreating towards the mountain Maoundur in the district of Khulaan Burkhat. Chinghiz forming his army in order, marched along the river Ulkhuishilugeljit, and retired towards the district Dalannemurgesi. Afterwards Khadaandaldurkhan, one of Chinghiz's dependents who was separated from his wife, and had apparently been a prisoner with Wang Khan, came and reported that after Sankun had been wounded, his father said reproachfully that they had begun a struggle with a man who ought not to have been provoked, hence, he says, \"this wound in my son's cheek. He is still alive. Let him take warning.\" Thereupon Aehikshilun replied, \"Sire, cease to talk thus. When you had no son, you prayed for a successor; now that you have one, be more considerate towards him. We have still more than one half of our Dada, i.e., Tartars. The people who have left us and gone to Temujin, where will they fly to? They are cavalry, and will certainly halt for the night under trees. If they will\nnot return to us, we will enclose them like a herd of horses.\u201d Wang Khan then gave orders that his son should be carefully tended. Chinghiz having left the district of Dalan-nemurgesi, went along the river Khalkha. Having mustered his people, he found there were two thousand six hundred of them who went along the western, while the other half with the Uruut and Mankhut, went along the eastern bank. They amused themselves with hunting, in which, contrary to the wish of Chinghiz, Khuildar took an active part. His wound had not yet healed. It opened afresh, and he died. His body was buried on the steep side of the mountain Orneu, near the river Khalkha. At the outfall of the Khalkha into lake Buyur, there lived Terge and other Ungirs (i.e. Kongurut) Chinghiz sent Jurchidai at the head of the Uruut and Mankhut to these Kongurut, to say to them, \u201cRemember my ancient descent and submit to me; if not, prepare to fight.\u201d It will be remembered that the Kongurut had sided with Chamukha against him. On receiving his message, they at once submitted, and he did not therefore molest them. He now returned homewards to the eastern bank of the river Tungeli, doubtless a feeder of the Onon, whence he sent a message to Wang Khan, to which we shall revert presently (Yuan chao pi shi, pp. 90, 91).\n\nWe can easily fix the geography of this campaign. The river Khalkha, flowing into lake Buyur, still bears the name. The Ulkhui Shilugelgit is doubtless the Olkhui or Ulkui, which rises in the so-called Soyolki mountains, a part of the Khingan, whence flow the northern affluents of the Khalkha. The Olkhui flows into a small lake in the eastern part of the Gobi. This again is confirmed by Rashid-ud-din, who tells us the battle of Khalaljin Alat was fought on the frontier of the land of the Jurchis, i.e. of Manchuria, not far from the river Olkhui. In D\u2019Anville\u2019s map, one of the mountains of the Soyolki range is called Halgon, which answers in part to the form of the name as it appears in the Yuan shi, namely, Khalagun Ola. Ola, or Ala, means mountain, and has been corrupted into Alat by Rashid. We will now return to our story. Having retired to the river Tungeli, a place rich in\ngrass, and excellent for horses, Chinghiz wrote a plaintive letter to his old friend recalling the many services he had done him. Inter alia, he said, \"Father, why are you thus angry with me, causing me terror? If you wish to upbraid me, why not do it in a quiet fashion, and without destroying all my possessions? Probably there are people who have come between us. Did we not make an agreement at Khulanu on the mountain Shorkhelkun, that if people came to slander either of us to the other, we were not to believe them until we had had a personal interview? Father, have we had such an interview?\" (Yuan chao pi shi). The latter parts of the address, as reported in the Huang yuan, and by Rashid, have a certain local flavour which tempts me to quote them. The former says, \"Did we not agree that even if we should be bitten by a serpent with poisonous fangs, we would not be moved by it, and that we would never part asunder until our lips should produce teeth? Have you been bitten by a serpent. Have teeth appeared on your lips, that you should depart? Father Wang Khan, at that time like a young falcon, starting from the mountain Chikhurkhi (i.e. probably the mountains elsewhere called Checher ondur), I flew over to the lake Buyur, seized the spotted-legged heron and returned. What was this but the tribes Khatagin, Saljiut, and Kongurut\" (op. cit. p. 171). The concluding paragraph of the letter, as reported in the same authority, runs as follows: \"Father Wang Khan, have you ever done me a service where I have done so many for you? Why do you now threaten me? Why don't you let my people rest at their firesides, and sleep on their beds? Why don't you leave me, who am your stupid son, and my stupid wives alone? I am your son. I am very weak. I cannot compel you to love the power of others. I am very stupid and cannot make you love the wisdom of others. If you detach one wheel from a cart, you cannot drive it, and your ox would sweat in vain. In that case, to unyoke it and let it go would be to tempt thieves, while to tether him would be to let him die of hunger. With a broken wheel it is clear an ox may strain himself till he\nbreaks his neck, and all in vain. Am I not also one of the wheels of a cart?\" Rashid-ud-din tells the same story, only that in his version the ambiguous sentence above quoted comes out quite clear. It runs thus: \"I who am your son, I have never said\u2014My part is too small, I want a larger one; it is bad, I want a better one,\" and he concludes the paragraph thus: \"We two are the body of this two-wheeled cart, and I am a wheel of thy cart.\"\n\nWhen Wang Khan received the list of grievances indited by Chinghiz Khan, as I have described, we are told in the Yuan chao pi shi that he reproached himself, and cutting his little finger with a knife, he filled a little birch-bark vessel with the blood, and said, \"If I in future do my son Temujin any harm, may I be cut to pieces,\" and with these words he gave the blood to the envoys, who brought it to Chinghiz.\n\nThe latter now sent a bitter message to Chamukha. \"Out of envy and malice you have sown discord between the Khan my father and me,\" he said. \"In former days it was customary for the one who was up first to drink mare's milk out of the father's (Wang Khan's) green cup.\\(^1\\) I always rose early, and in consequence you hated me. You may now drink out of the full green cup of our father. It will be very little diminished.\" This somewhat enigmatical message doubtless conveyed a threat. Palladius says it seems to hint that Chinghiz Khan in his young days lived with Wang Khan (\\textit{op. cit.} note 320).\n\nChinghiz also sent a message to his relatives, Altan and Khujer or Khuchar. \"I do not know why you determined to desert me. Khuchar, you as the son of Nikuntaishi,\\(^2\\) would have been made ruler of our people, but that you refused it.\" \"Altan, your father, the Khan Khutula, once ruled, and the people therefore wished to make you their Khan, but you refused.\\(^3\\) The sons of Bartan, Sacha and Taichu, were senior branches of the family, but they also\n\n\\(^1\\) Perhaps jade cup is meant.\n\\(^2\\) Nikuntaishi was Yessugei's elder brother, so Khuchar had better claims to the throne than his cousin Temujin. See Palladius, note 322.\n\\(^3\\) Altan was cousin to Chinghiz Khan's father.\nrefused. By general consent you elected me Khan against my own wish. Now that you have deserted me, pray help Wang Khan diligently, but don\u2019t begin a business which you cannot complete, and thus secure the people\u2019s hatred for yourselves. Trust in Temujin, for you cannot do without him. Defend to the last the sources of the three rivers (i.e. the Onon, the Kerulon, and Tula, the cradle-land of the Mongols), and do not let any one occupy them.\u201d To Tooril or Tughril, whom he addressed as brother, he said, \u201cI call you brother because in former times Tunbina (i.e. Tumeneh Khan) and Charakhailinkhu (i.e. Jerki Lingun) had a slave called Okhda, and Okhda had a son called Subegai, who had a son Kokochukirsan, who had a son Yegaikhuantokhar, who was thy father. For the sake of whom are you flattering Wang Khan? If Altan and Kuchar will not have me, they will never allow any one else to rule over our people, and you are my slave by descent\u201d (Yuan chao pi shi, pp. 93, 94). Chinghiz also sent a message to Wang Khan\u2019s son, Sankun. \u201cI am your father\u2019s son, and was born with clothes: you are his son, but you were born naked. Our father never caressed us both equally. You became suspicious and afraid that I should come before you; you hated and sent me away. Cease now to cause your father grief and suffering. Go to him and dispel his sorrow and loneliness. If you do not rid yourself of your old jealous spirit, you will be trying to become ruler during his lifetime and cause him suffering.\u201d\n\nWhen Arkhaikhasar and Sugyegaijiun had delivered Chinghiz Khan\u2019s message to Sankun, the latter said, \u201cWhen he gave my father the title of Khan, he really meant to call him \u2018the Butcher of the people,\u2019 and when he styled me Anda, he meant to say Tokhtoashuin.\u201d I have discovered the hidden meaning of his words. They mean\n\n1 Sacha and Taichu were not sons of Bartau, but sons of Khutukhtu-Jurki, son of Ukin Barkhakh, Bartan\u2019s elder brother, and had therefore also superior claims to the latter\u2019s descendants.\n\n2 This is no doubt some proverbial phrase in use among the Mongols. Palladius says the last expression means to have connection with the Myerkitams, to whom was allotted the plaiting of sheeps\u2019 tails and curls, and was a term of opprobrium, since sheeps\u2019 tails and curls were deemed useless (Id. notes 330, 331).\nwar. You Bilgebike and Todoyan raise the great standard and feed the horses. There is no room for further doubt.\u201d Then Arkhaikhasar (i.e. Chinghiz Khan\u2019s envoy) returned, but his companion Sugyegaijium remained behind, inasmuch as his wife was in the hands of Tughril, i.e. of Wang Khan (op. cit. pp. 94, 95).\n\nThe Huang yuan adds a little local colour in a phrase in which Chinghiz explains how, when the others refused the Khanship, he took it because he did not wish to see an old inhabited country overgrown with wild grass, nor the cart roads obstructed by broken doors (op. cit. p. 173). This authority and Rashid-ud-din close the letter with a reminder how Chinghiz had made over to his relatives the booty in cattle in kibitkas, women and children which he had captured, and how he had enclosed for them the wild game of the plains and driven to them the wild game of the mountains (Berezine, vol. ii. pp. 139, 140; Erdmann, pp. 292, 293; D\u2019Ohsson, vol. i. pp. 77, 78; Huang yuan, pp. 172, 173).\n\nMr. Douglas has printed an anecdote somewhat like the one above quoted from the biography of Chapar or Jabar, which, as it does not occur in Hyacinthe, is probably derived like other stories from the She-wei or Woof of History, by Chin-Yun-Seih. According to this account, Chinghiz Khan having suffered a very severe defeat at the hands of Wang Khan, had to fly with but nineteen followers, and escaped to the river Panchuni, i.e. the Baljuna. His provisions being exhausted, and being in distress, a crow passed by, whereupon a flight of arrows was shot, which killed it. A difficulty arose as to how it was to be cooked, upon which Chapar or the Ghebr, a tall, square-eyed, broad-foreheaded western worshipper of fire, said, \u201cGive me the bird.\u201d He took it, and skinned it, and having put as much of the flesh as would make a meal for Chinghiz Khan into the skin, and having added water from the river, he boiled the flesh in the skin over the fire (Douglas, p. 38). Mr. Douglas says that the Chinese editor adds a marginal note of exclamation, \u201cA wonderful pot, indeed!\u201d I would remark that Chapar is mentioned in the Yuan shi lei pen as one of Chinghiz Khan\u2019s companions at\nthis time. In that work we are told he belonged to a royal family of the west called Sai-i (Descendant of the Sassanian princes). He was well skilled in war, and was a worshipper of fire, and the Chinese text adds as a gloss to his name Cha-pa-ul (the Chinese way of writing Chapar), the character ho meaning fire, and the text explains that this is added to show what the religion of Chapar was.\u00b9 The Yuan shi lei pen also refers to the distress of Chinghiz at Pan chu ni, tells us that Khazar killed a horse for him there, and that he and his companions swore a solemn oath of fidelity to each other, drinking meanwhile from the muddy water of the Pan chu ni. It adds that the officers with their families who thus drank together were always highly regarded and piqued themselves on their special fidelity (op. cit. p. 9).\n\nRashid-ud-din says that after the battle of Khalaljin Alat, Chinghiz Khan was obliged to withdraw, and retired to Baljuna, where both men and cattle had to drink from turbid water, inasmuch as there was only an insignificant and scanty supply. On his way the greater part of his army left him under the pretext that he had altered the existing laws and regulations, and that he had grown too weak to make a stand. He thereupon insisted that those who were faithful to him should swear with their eyes raised to heaven and their hands clasped, to remain true, through bitter and through sweet, and that if they broke their word that they might become like the muddy water of the Baljuna. Having drunk from the bowl, he gave it to his companions, who also drank. These faithful companions, we are told, were afterwards known as Baljuntu, and were magnificently rewarded. Von Hammer compares the name with that of Mohajirin, i.e. outcasts, borne by the companions of Muhammad\u2019s early misfortunes (Berezine, vol. ii. pp. 132, 133; Erdmann, p. 288;\n\n\u00b9 Gaubil, pp. 6, 9. Chapar or Jabar is mentioned in chapter 120, in the biographical section of the Yuan-shi. Bretschneider reads Dja-ba-r huo-djo. He says that he was reported to belong to Sai yi in the Si y\u00fc (i.e. the Western land, meaning here Persia). He was the chief of his tribe, whence the title of Huo-djo, which, we are told, in their language was the name of an office (doubtless the Persian Khojah). He was tall, with a long beard, large eyes, and broad forehead, brave, and a skilful rider and archer.\u2014Bretschneider, Notices, etc. p. 49.\nD'Ohsson, vol. i. pp. 71, 72; Von Hammer, Golden Horde, p. 65). The Yuan shi says that Chinghiz Khan, while in his weak condition at Panehuni, was joined by a section of the Kongurut and by Putu, the chief of the Ekhilasze or Inkirasses, who had been driven away by the Khurulas (Hyacinthe, pp. 28, 29; Douglas, pp. 38, 39). The Yuan shi lei pen says he was joined by his brothers-in-law Wachen, chief of the Hongila, i.e. the Kongurut, and Putu, of the Ikiliesse, by Kueli, brother of Toli (i.e. of Wang Khan), by Chapar and several other chiefs (Gaubil, p. 9). The Huang yuan and Rashid-ud-din also mention that the Inkirasses, who were being pressed by the Khurulas, joined Chinghiz Khan at this time (Huang yuan, p. 175; Erdmann, p. 288). All the authorities mention that he was also joined by his brother Khazar. The Yuan chao pi shi tells us that Khazar, who had been with Wang Khan, left his wife and his three sons Yegu, Yesungi, and Tukhu in the latter's hands, and escaped without anything, and with some of his companions went to search for his brother. He got as far as the Karaun, i.e. the Khing-gan, but could not see him from its summit. His provisions were exhausted, and he was reduced to feed on the raw hide and the sinews of a cow. In this condition he reached lake Baljuna, where he had an interview with Chinghiz (op. cit. p. 92).\n\nIn the Yuan shi we read that Chinghiz was joined by Khazar (called Khojar by Hyacinthe, and Hochar by Douglas) with his little son To-kan or Tokwan, who came from the Kalagun-ol (Douglas reads it Holakwan, but Hyacinthe's is doubtless the correct reading, the name being the Chinese transcript of Karaun). He had been routed by Wang Khan, who had captured his wives and his other children. On the road he had run short of provisions and been forced to subsist on the birds' eggs he found on the way (Hyacinthe, p. 29; Douglas, p. 39). De Mailla tells the same story (op. cit., tom. ix. p. 32).\n\nThe two brothers having met, consulted together, and arranged a plot to circumvent Wang Khan. They agreed to send Khaliutar of the tribe Jaorid or Juriat, and Chaur-\nkhan of the tribe Uriaugkut, to him. They were to profess to have come from Khazar with the following message: \"I have not seen the shadow of my brother. I have traversed many roads, but have not met him; have called to him, but he has not heard me. At night I have slept with the earth for my pillow and with the stars overhead. My wife and children are in your hands; Father Khan, if you will send me a trusty man, I will come to you.\" Chinghiz bade the messengers go with this message, and told them he should order the camp to be raised and to be moved to the plain of Arkhalgougi on the river Kerulon. Having made these arrangements, he ordered Jurchidai and Arkai to lead, and pitched his camp with Khazar in the plain just mentioned (Yuan chao pi shi, p. 96).\n\nThe two messengers on their arrival delivered their master's message. Wang Khan had only just erected a golden tent and was feasting. On hearing their story, he said, \"If this be really so, then let Khazar come.\" He then sent them back, and with them one of the most trusty of his people, Iturgian. On nearing the appointed rendezvous, Iturgian noticed in the distance a number of figures and shadows. Suspecting something, he halted, turned round and galloped towards home. Khaliutar, who rode a swifter horse, speedily overtook him, but not daring to touch him, merely blocked up the road, so that he could not proceed. Thereupon Chakhurkhan, who was on a heavier horse, took aim and shot Iturgian's horse in the hip. The horse fell; and he then seized its rider and took him to Chinghiz, who handed him over to Khazar with orders to kill him. His messengers informed Chinghiz that Wang Khan was feasting, and that if he marched speedily he might surprise him. He accordingly ordered the army to set out, and told Jurchidai and Arkhai to lead (id. p. 97). According to the Yuan shi, Chinghiz, before fighting with Wang Khan, wanted to secure the safety of Khazar's wives and children, and he accordingly sent two of his trusty dependents, who feigned to be Khazar's servants, and said the latter offered to submit himself with bound hands, if the Khan would forget their\nrecent quarrels and renew their old friendship. These words put Wang Khan off his guard. He sent back a bag of blood with which to consecrate the oath of friendship he was prepared to swear with Khazar (Hyacinthe, pp. 29, 30; Douglas, pp. 40, 41). Rashid-ud-din tells the story at greater length. He calls the place where Khazar had been living Karaun Chidun, and his two messengers Khaliudar the Juriat and Chaurkhan (called Jarwergha Ilaghan by Erdmann) the Uriangkit, and reports their message as follows: Juchi Khasar has sent us with this message:\n\n\"May it be well with my patron. My heart is indeed full of my elder brother, my lord, and yet I know not if I may be permitted to see him. Although I wish to unite myself closely with thee, yet there is no way open for me to do so? I have heard, O Khan my father! that my wife and children are with thee. I have already passed a long time on barren journeys and arid pastures, my pillow has been the rock and hard clod, and I have wandered about without friend or helper. I have the highest confidence in thee, and that is why I have sent these messengers to show thee my condition and ask for my wife and children again, that with all my belongings I may attach myself to thee.\"\n\nAs Wang Khan knew the messengers to be dependents of Khazar, as he also knew the unsettled condition of Chinghiz Khan's affairs and the miserable position of Khazar, he did not suspect any treachery, but received the messengers with special marks of favour, and when he dismissed them he also sent back with them one of his people called Iturgin (Erdmann reads it Ayat\u00fcrgan), and also sent some blood taken from his hand, in a horn, for, says Rashid-ud-din, it is the custom with the Mongols to seal a compact by the shedding of blood. The three companions set out on their return, while Chinghiz Khan at the head of his army rode night and day to surprise his enemy. Presently Khaliudar saw Chinghiz Khan's Tuk or standard in the distance, and fearing that Iturgin, if he also saw it, would at once set off on his swift horse and give his master warning, he dismounted, pretending that a stone had got into his horse's\nhoof, and asked Iturgin to dismount too and hold the foot, thus causing some delay. Meanwhile Chinghiz Khan arrived. Iturgin was dumb-founded. He was handed over to Juchi Khazar, inasmuch as he had appropriated his wives and children and worldly goods (Berezine, vol. ii. pp. 143-45; Erdmann, pp. 296, 297; D'Ohisson, vol. i. pp. 80, 81). The Huang yuan as usual tells the story like Rashid-ud-din. It calls the place where Khazar took shelter after the battle of Khalaljin Alat, Khalakhunjidun (i.e. Karaun Chidun), and says the blood which Wang Khan took from his hand he sent in a vessel used for boiling water (op. cit. pp. 175, 176).\n\nWe have seen how, having put his enemy off his guard, Chinghiz Khan marched against him swiftly and furtively. When he reached the defile of Jerkhabuchikha in the mountains Checher ondur, doubtless on the Lower Kerulon, he surrounded Wang Khan and his people, and a battle ensued which lasted three days; on the third day, the Kirais being completely overcome, submitted. Wang Khan and his son fled.\n\nOne of the Kirais who had fought in the battle said to Chinghiz: \"It would have been wrong for me to have let you take and kill my rightful Lord, therefore I have fought you for three days so as to give him a better chance of escaping. If you now order me to be executed, I shall no doubt die; but if you spare me, I will serve you faithfully.\" Chinghiz replied, \"He who did not wish to desert his lord, but fought against me to give him time to escape, is a brave fellow. Be my companion.\" Chinghiz thereupon made him a commander of a hundred men, and gave him to the widow of Khuildar as her slave and dependent. Khuildar, it will be remembered, had been the first volunteer to fight, and had thus earned for himself and his descendants the right to ask for the rewards due to the widows and children. Chinghiz Khan now proceeded to divide the Kirais among his allies. To Takhai-baatur of the tribe Sulduda (? Suldus) who had given him assistance, he gave one hundred tents of the Jirgin tribe. Wang Khan's brother Jakhaganbu (Ja-\nkhanbo as Rashid calls him), of whom we have previously spoken, had two daughters; the elder one, Abakha, Chinghiz had married himself, while the younger one, called Siur-kukteni, had married Tului (i.e. his son Tului), whence he would not permit Jakhanbu\u2019s people to be distributed. Bada and Kishlikh, the two herdsmen who had first warned him of Wang Khan\u2019s hostile intentions, were given the latter\u2019s golden tent and its contents, together with the people who had charge of his golden vessels. He also made over to them the family of Bankhojin of the race of Kirai, to form a body-guard, granted them the privilege of wearing their bows and arrows during the feasts, and ordered that at such feasts they were each to have a flagon of his own. He also gave them the right to retain the booty they should capture in battle and the wild animals they should secure in the hunt without sharing them with others. He extolled them, saying they had saved his life, and that now he had annihilated the Kirais, he had secured the throne of the Mongols. \u201cLet my descendants notice the rewards due to such services.\u201d During the winter following his victory, Chinghiz remained in the district of Abujiakodiger (Yuan chao pi shi, pp. 97\u201399).\n\nRashid-ud-din mentions that the defeat was preceded by a conspiracy among some of Wang Khan\u2019s allies. In this there took part Daritai Chigen, Chinghiz Khan\u2019s uncle, Altan Jiun, Khujir or Khuchar Biki, Chamukha, Khum Barin, Suekei or Suwagi, Toghril of the race Tuken Tudul (written Nugteh Buul by Erdmann), Tugai, Khaguri the Mangkut, and Khutu Timur, a Tartar prince. They agreed to fall upon Wang Khan in the night, and then to become independent leaders, obeying neither Wang Khan nor Chinghiz. Having heard of their plans, Wang Khan fell upon them, took much of their wealth from them, and scattered them, whereupon Daritai Chigen, Khum Barin (Erdmann and D\u2019Ohsson both make this a tribal name and read it a section of the Niruns), and the Sakhiat, a tribe of the Kirais, joined Chinghiz Khan, while Altan, Khujir and Khutu Timur went to Tayang, the chief of the Naimans. At this time Wang Khan was\nencamped at Kit Khulu khat alat (written Cait eulgat alt by D'Ohsson; Berezine, vol. ii. pp. 142, 143; Erdmann, p. 295; D'Ohsson, vol. i. pp. 79, 80).\n\nWe are told in the Yuan shi and by Rashid-ud-din that the Kirai chief in his flight reproached himself for having been persuaded as he had been by his son, whom he accused of being the author of his misfortunes (Douglas, p. 42; Hyaeinthe, p. 30; Berezine, vol. ii. p. 145; Erdmann, p. 297). The Huang yuan says he exclaimed to Sankun, \"We are relatives, can we die apart now that we have been undone by these people?\" (op. cit. p. 176).\n\nFather and son according to the Yuan chao pi shi escaped to the district of Didiksakhal, and the river Nyekun, which Palladius suggests was probably the boundary between the Naimans and the Kirais. There Wang Khan, wearied with his journey and suffering from thirst, went to drink in the river. He was seen by a Naiman scout called Khorisubechi, who captured him, and although he explained who he was, he would not believe him, but killed him on the spot. Sankun, who was some distance off, rode away to Chual.\u00b9 There he arrived with his companions Kokochu and his wife, and while looking for water saw a wild horse being bitten by flies. Dismounting from his own, he gave it in charge of Kokochu, and crept towards the other, intending to shoot it. Kokochu thereupon determined to desert him. His wife reproached him, saying, \"He clothed you in fine clothes, fed you with good food, wherefore would you forsake your lawful lord?\" Kokochu replied that as she would not go with him, she perhaps wished to marry Sankun.\n\nShe retorted with a Mongol aphorism, \"Let them say that women have dogs' skin on their faces\" (i.e. have no shame); \"nevertheless I must ask you to give him this gold cup from which he may drink.\" Kokochu threw down the cup, and then with his wife repaired to Chinghiz, to whom he related how he had deserted Sankun. That exacting\n\n\u00b9 I find a station Chel on the map, north-east of Barkul and south-west of Chaghan Tala, which possibly answers to this Chual.\nmaster said: \"How can I receive such people as companions?\" He thereupon had Kokochu put to death, but rewarded his wife, and gave her to one of his officers (op. cit. pp. 99, 100). This authority does not tell us what was the end of Sankun. In the Yuan shi we are told he first fled to Si Hia or Si Sia (i.e. Western Hia or Tangut, comprising the modern Kansuh and the northern part of Shen si). There, being convicted of plundering, he went to the kingdom whose name is written Kuchaskiya by Hyacinthe and Kweisil by Douglas (Hyacinthe, p. 31; Douglas, p. 42). De Mailla says that having been driven away from Hia he fled to the Kuess\u00ea, by whose king he was attacked and killed (op. cit. tom. ix. p. 34). The Yuan shi lei pen says that after Wang Khan's defeat, his rival returned to the Onon, whence he sent detachments in pursuit of him. He was captured, but the same day he again escaped and fled to the Naimans, where he was killed. It calls the place where Sankun was put to death by order of the ruler of the country Kutse (Gaubil, p. 10). Rashid-ud-din says that after his defeat Wang Khan fled to a place in the country of the Naimans called Nirgun Ussun (D'Ohsson calls it On Ussun, which name means the ten rivers in Turkish, op. cit. vol. i. p. 82, note 2). There he was seized by Khori Subaju and Tung or Iteng Shal, two frontier commanders of Tayang, the Naiman ruler. They put him to death, and sent his head to their master. Sankun fled to a place whose name is read Ashik Balgasun by Berezinc, and Istu Balghasun by Erdmann (see Erdmann, note 160), but the name is evidently corrupt. It doubtless ought to be read Itzina, as it is given in the Huang yuan (it was a town of Tangut). Thence he hastened on to the frontiers of Jul or Chul on the extreme borders of the Mongols (i.e. the Chual of the Yuan ehao pi shi above mentioned), and thence he went to Buri Tibet (i.e. to the country of Tibet, which is so called by Carpini, D'Avezae, p. 658). Having engaged in plundering there, he was attacked by the inhabitants; he again fled to the country of Khoten and Kashgar. D'Ohsson says to the district of Kumon on the borders of Kashgar and Khoten. Erdmann\nsays to the borders of Jin and Kashgar and the district of Gushan.\n\nThere he was attacked and killed by Kilij Arslan, the chief of the tribe Kilij or Khalaj, in a place called Kusaku-char-kusha (Erdmann reads it Gusatu-jau-gasneh, D'Ohsson Keussatu-char-kashme), who sent his wives and children prisoners to Chinghiz Khan, and shortly after himself submitted to that chief (Berezinc, vol. ii. p. 146; Erdmann, p. 298; D'Ohsson, vol. i. pp. 82, 83). The Huang yuan calls the place where Wang Khan was captured the river Nikium uli, and names the Naiman chiefs who killed him Kholisu bachi and Tedusha. It says that Sankun fled to Sisia, passed the town of Itzina, and reached the country of the Bolin Tufan (i.e. the Buri Tibet of other authors). He fell upon the people there, and plundered them, but the Tufans drove him and his followers away westwards. He was eventually killed by Khelinchukhala (i.e. Kilij Khan) in the country of Chergeziman (i.e. the Kusaku char kusha of Rashid, Huang yuan, p. 176).\n\nSsanang Setzen, whose narrative of these events is of hardly any value, dates the defeat of \"Ong Khaghan,\" as he calls Wang Khan, in 1198. He places the battle at the outflow of the river Onon (clearly a mistake for the Kerulon) near K\u00fclen Buira (i.e. the well-known lake Buyur, which was near the heights of Checher). He further tells us Chinghiz Khan's army was led by T\u00f6r\u00f6lji Taishi of the Uriat, Jelme Noyan of the Uriangkhan and the son of Kilukan Baghatur of the Sunid called Tudai Tsarbi, who defeated Ong Khaghan and subdued the Kerait (op. cit. p. 87).\n\nThe conquest of the Kirais and their ruler was a great step in Chinghiz Khan's career. It made him a widely notorious person, and we consequently find the campaign referred to by other and independent authorities than those we have quoted, and notably by the Christian chroniclers, who were specially interested in the overthrow of Prester John, as they styled Wang Khan. I propose to close this instalment of my story by bringing together two or three of these notices.\nAbulfaraj, whose narrative at this period is largely constructed on the basis of that of Juveni, tells us that in 599 Hijra, i.e. the year from 20th September 1202 to 9th September 1203 A.D., when Unaeh Khan, who is the same with the Christian king John, ruled over a certain race of the barbarous Huns called Kherith, Chinghiz Khan was in his service. He became jealous of him, and secretly determined his ruin and death. Of this Chinghiz was warned by two youths. Unach Khan fell suddenly upon his tent, but he had withdrawn with his people in time and concealed himself. Abulfaraj then tells us how a battle was fought at Balshuia between the rivals, in which Chinghiz was unfortunate. This was followed by a second, in which he was victorious. His rival was killed and his wives and children made prisoners. He then describes how the two youths were rewarded as we have already mentioned. Abulfaraj accounts for Unach Khan's defeat by the fact that he had married a daughter of the ruler of Kara Khitai, who had persuaded him to apostatize (Chron. Syr. pp. 447, 448). Abulfaraj dates this struggle as we have seen in 1202-3, in which he agrees with Rashid-ud-din and the Yuan shi (Berezine, vol. ii. p. 143; Hyacinthe, p. 24; Douglas, p. 33).\n\nRubruquis has a confused account of Wang Khan, whom he calls Unk, and makes him the brother of Johannes. He tells us he ruled over the Crit and Merkit, who were Nestorian Christians, but that he had become an apostate and a worshipper of idols, and had surrounded himself with idolatrous priests, who had recourse to necromancy, etc. He says he was master of a certain town called Caracaron. On the death of his brother Johannes, Rubruquis says that Unk caused himself to be proclaimed Khan, and moved with his flocks and herds to the frontiers of Moal, i.e. of the Mongols. At that time Chinghiz, a certain Mongol who was a smith, harried some of Unk Khan's animals. The latter marched an army against him, whereupon he fled among the Tartars and there concealed himself. Unk Khan, having plundered the Moals and Tartars, returned home; thereupon Chinghiz addressed the Tartars and Moals, saying, \"It is because we\nhave no leader that our neighbours oppress us.\" They therupon made him the chief of the Tartars and Moals. Having collected an army furtively, he fell upon Unk, and defeated him. He fled to Cathaia (by this Rubruquis no doubt means Kara Khitai). Unk's daughter (really his niece), our author adds, was captured and given by Chinghiz in marriage to one of his sons, and she became the mother of Mangu (D'Avezac, pp. 261, 262).\n\nAccording to Joinville, \"The Tartarins lived in a great berier (of sand),\\(^1\\) and were subject to Prester John and the Emperor of Persia, whose country bordered on theirs, and to many other bad kings (roys mescreans), to each of whom they did homage for the pastures where they kept their cattle.\" They were held in such contempt by their suzerains that when they took them their tribute they turned their backs and not their faces to them. Among the Tartarins was a sage man who visited the various steppes and conferred with the men whom he met and pointed out to them the condition of servitude in which they were, and having summoned them to a meeting, showed them how, if they chose themselves a leader, they might break the yoke. Accordingly each of the fifty-two clans who were present produced an arrow which was marked with its name, and by the wish of the whole people they were placed before a child five years old, and it was decided whichever name appeared on the arrow selected by the child, they should nominate themselves a chief from that clan. The choice fell of course on the sage man, who was no other than Chinghiz Khan, and who demanded that if they wanted him to lead them they must swear by Him who had made heaven and earth to obey the laws he should make for them. He accordingly drew up some regulations against theft, adultery, etc. He then told them that the most powerful of their masters was Prester John, and ordered them to be ready to march against him the following day. \"If we are beaten, which God forbid,\" he said, \"each one must seek safety in flight. If we win, I\n\n\\(^1\\) Col. Yule says the Arabic b\u0101riya\u2014a desert; Marco Polo, vol. i. p. 233.\norder that the pursuit must continue for three days and nights, and no one, on pain of death, must seize any of the booty, which shall be fairly divided.\u201d The next day they fell on the enemy, and defeated him, killing all those whom they found bearing arms. The priests and other religious they allowed to go free, while the rest of the people were reduced to slavery (Joinville, Dom Bouquet, vol. xx. pp. 262, 263).\n\nMarco Polo gives a longer account of the struggle. I have already quoted his notice of the ill-starred negociations between the two chiefs for a marriage between their families. He goes on to report that Chinghiz was greatly enraged at Prester John\u2019s insolent message to him, and threatened him with vengeance. He collected his people, and marched against him. Prester John professed to have contempt for this army, but he in turn collected his forces. Chinghiz, he says, advanced to a vast and beautiful plain called Tenduc, which was in Prester John\u2019s country, where he pitched his camp, having an innumerable host with him. Prester John pitched his camp twenty miles away, and both armies rested for two days that they might be fresher for the fight. During this delay Chinghiz summoned his astrologers to foretell who was going to win in the approaching battle. The Saracens essayed in vain to forecast the issue, but the Christians were more successful. Having split a cane in two, they put the two halves side by side, so that no one should touch them. One piece they named Chinghiz Khan, and the other Prester John. They then read a psalm from the Psalter, and went through other incantations, upon which the cane which was called Chinghiz approached the other without any one touching it, and got on the top of it. This very promising augury greatly delighted the Mongol chief, who always after treated the Christians very kindly. In the battle which followed, Polo says the slaughter was very great on both sides, but eventually Chinghiz won the victory, and Prester John was slain, and his kingdom passed into the hands of Chinghiz Khan (op. cit. ed. Yule, vol. i. pp. 235-239).\nWe have seen how Wang Khan was killed by the Naiman frontier commander. The Yuan chao pi shi says that when the mother of Tayang, the Naiman chief, who was called Gurbyessu, heard of his death, she said, \"Wang Khan was a great ruler, bring me the head to see if it be really his; if so, then we will make a sacrifice to it.\" She accordingly sent some people to Khorisubichi, who had killed him. They cut off the head and took it to her. On seeing that it was really his, they began playing musical instruments to it, so as to attract the spirit of the dead chief, and also made a sacrifice. During this proceeding a smile passed over the face of Wang Khan. Tayang, noticing this smile, and taking it as a bad omen, crushed the head with his foot, whereupon one of the bystanders named Keksiusabrakh said, \"You have cut off a dead man's head and crushed it with your foot, now even your dog anticipates misfortune\" (Yuan chao pi shi, p. 100). De la Croix, apparently quoting Abulkhair, has a passage somewhat like the one abstracted from the Yuan chao pi shi. He tells us that when Tayang saw the head of Wang Khan, he could not help insulting it, on which Abulkhair remarks, \"'Tis a base action to rend the beard from a dead lion.\" Rashid-ud-din merely tells us that Tayang reproached his followers for having killed the old chief, saying they ought to have captured him alive; and that he then had his skull encased in silver, and placed it on a throne facing the door of his yurt or tent. One day the tongue of the dead chief was seen to protrude from the mouth. This happened several times, and was interpreted as an evil augury by the Naiman chiefs (Erdmann, op. cit. p. 236).\n\nWang Khan, according to Rashid-ud-din, had two sons, Sankun or Sengun, whose history I have related, and Iku. Iku, we are told, had a son Sarijeh. I would suggest as possible that Sarijeh is a corruption of George, and that he was the George mentioned by Marco Polo and others. Marco Polo says, \"Tenduc is a province which lies towards the east, and contains numerous towns and villages, among which is the chief city, also called Tenduc. The king of the province is of the lineage of Prester John, George by name, and he\nholds the land under the Great Kaan; not that he holds anything like the whole of what Prester John possessed. It is a custom, I may tell you, that these kings of the lineage of Prester John always obtain to wife either daughters of the Great Kaan or other princesses of his family (Yule's Marco Polo, vol. i. p. 275). Again, he says, you must know that it was in this same capital city of Tenduc that Prester John had the seat of his government when he ruled over the Tartars, and his heirs still abide there; for, as I have told you, this King George is of his line, in fact he is the sixth in descent from Prester John (Yule's Marco Polo, vol. i. pp. 275-6). Later on Marco Polo reverts to this George, whom he now calls the grandson of Prester John. This is in his account of the struggle of the Grand Khan Khubilai with his rival Kaidu, and he tells us that George, the grandson of Prester John, was posted at Karakorum with Khubilai's son Mirungan, and that they had a great force of cavalry with them. He also calls him the Younger Prester John (Yule, op. cit. vol. ii. pp. 457-460).\n\nJohn of Monte Corvino, who was born in Calabria in 1247, became afterwards Archbishop of Khanbaligh or Peking. In his letter of January, 1305, from that city, he speaks of Polo's King George in these terms: \"A certain king of this part of the world, by name George, belonging to the sect of the Nestorian Christians, and of the illustrious lineage of that great king who was called Prester John of India, in the first year of my arrival here (circa 1295-6), attached himself to me, and, after he had been converted by me to the verity of the Catholic faith (i.e. converted from Nestorianism), took the Lesser Orders, and when I celebrated mass used to attend me, wearing his royal robes. Certain others of the Nestorians on this account accused him of apostacy, but he brought over a great part of his people with him to the true Catholic faith, and built a church of royal magnificence in honour of our God, of the Holy Trinity, and of our lord the Pope, giving it the name of the Roman Church. This King George, six years ago, departed to the Lord, a true Christian, leaving as his heir a son scarcely out of the cradle, and who\nis now nine years old. And after King George's death his brothers, perfidious followers of the errors of Nestorius, perverted again all those whom he had brought over to the Church, and carried them back to their original schismatical creed. And being all alone, and not able to leave his majesty the Cham, I could not go to visit the church above mentioned, which is twenty days' journey distant. Yet if I could get some good fellow-workers to help me, I trust in God that all this might be retrieved, for I still possess the grant which was made in our favour by the late King George before mentioned. . . . I had been in treaty with the late King George, if he had lived, to translate the whole Latin ritual, that it might be sung throughout the extent of his territory; and whilst he was alive I used to celebrate mass in his church according to the Latin ritual\" (Cathay and the Way Thither, pp. 199-202). Colonel Yule says: \"The distance mentioned, twenty days' journey from Peking, suits quite well with the position assigned to Tenduc, and no doubt the Roman Church was in the city to which Marco Polo gives that name\" (Marco Polo, vol. i. p. 278).\n\nFriar Odoric, travelling westwards from China in 1326-7, says that he arrived, after a journey of fifty days, at the country of Prester John, whose principal city was Tozan, which although the chief city, Vicenza would be considered its superior. Besides it, he had many other cities under him, and by a standing compact always received to wife the Great Khan's daughter (Cathay and the Way Thither, pp. 146-7). This Tozan Colonel Yule identifies with Tathung, a circle of administration immediately east of Tung hia, and embracing a part of the country where the Mongol tribe of the Ordus now encamp (id. p. 146, note 2).\n\nI have suggested that George, who is made chief of the Kirais by Marco Polo and John of Monte Corvino, may be Sarijeh, the grandson of Wang Khan. The date would suit him well, and the names George and Sarijeh are very like one another, while the fact that two of Sarijeh's sisters were married to the great founder of the Ilkhan dynasty, Khulagu, would make him an important personage. These two sisters\nwere Dokuz Khatun and Tukteni Khatun; the former is described as a Christian and very friendly to the Christians.\n\nThe daughter of Sarijeh, we further read, became the wife of the Ilkhan Arghun and the mother of Uljaitu, or Khurbenda. Sarijeh's brother was called Abreiyin (Berezine, Erdmann, Temudschin, etc. p. 235).\n\nAbulfaraj tells us a curious story about what happened when Chinghiz Khan determined to invade the west and crush the Khuaresm Shah. He sent an envoy, who was killed at Otrar by the frontier commander there. This greatly enraged Chinghiz, who, we are told, eliminated a mountain, where, uncovering his head, and throwing his girdle over his shoulder, he invoked the vengeance of God, and passed three days and nights fasting; on the third night a monk dressed in black and bearing a staff in his hand appeared to him in a dream, and bade him fear nothing, and that he would be successful in the campaign he meditated. On awakening he repeated the dream to his wife, the daughter of Wang Khan, of the Kirais. She assured him that the monk was a bishop who was in the habit occasionally of visiting her father, and of giving him advice. Chinghiz Khan appealed to the Uighur Christians if they had any such bishop among them. They accordingly summoned Mar-Denha, who wore his black tiara, upon which Chinghiz said that, although the bishop was similarly dressed to the apparition which he had seen, his face was different. The bishop then said it must have been one of the Christian saints who had gone to him. After the adventure we are told Chinghiz treated the Christians with especial consideration. Vincent of Beauvais also speaks of Rabbanta, a Nestorian monk, who lived in the confidence of Chinghiz Khan's wife, daughter of the Christian king David, or Prester John, and who used by divination to make many revelations to the Tartars (Yule's Marco Polo, vol. i. p. 237).\n\nWe have seen how, when he conquered the Kirais, Chinghiz Khan divided their tribes among his supporters, he accepted those which obeyed Jakhanbo, who had been faithful to him, and with whose family he had so many ties by marriage. I may add that the royal stock of the Kalmuk tribe of the\nTorguts, according to a chronicle written by a Torgut prince named Gabung Sharraf, claims to be descended from a certain Kaowang or Ki wang, who separated himself with the Torguts from his sovereign Wang Khan, who is identified by Pallas and Remusat with Wang Khan of the Kirais (Pallas, Saml. Hist. Nach. vol. i. p. 56; Remusat, les Langues Tartares, p. 238). Ki wang, or Gui wang, is a mere Chinese title, and it was applied to one of Chinghiz Khan\u2019s great generals, Mukhuli Ki wang. The Ki wang of the Kalmuk Saga was not impossibly Jakhanbo already named. The same Saga tells us that Ki wang\u2019s son was Soffai, otherwise called Buyani Tetkukshi, whose son was Bayar, whose grandson was Makhatshi Menggo, with the surname of K\u00e4r\u00e4t, which surname was borne by all his descendants among the Torgut princes (Pallas, op. cit. vol. i. p. 56). It is not impossible that Jakhanbo may have been given a tribe of Mongolian origin, as well as some of the Kirais, for his subjects. According to the Persian historian, he detached one of Wang Khan\u2019s tribes, namely the Tungkait, from their allegiance to him, and appropriated them (Erdmann, Temudjin, p. 269).\n\nJakhanbo had, according to Rashid-ud-din, four daughters, Abika, who was married to Chinghiz Khan himself; Bigtutemish Fujin, who married his eldest son Juchi; Siurkukteni Bigi, who married his fourth son Talui, and became the mother of Mangu Khulagu, Khubilai and Arikbuka, all famous names in Mongol history; while the fourth daughter was married to a Prince of the Ongut or White Tartars.\n\nRashid-ud-din speaks of one of Wang Khan\u2019s chiefs named Khubedu, who abandoned him and joined Chinghiz Khan with his wife, his son, who was thirteen years old, a camel, and some horses. Chinghiz eventually rewarded him by making over to him a number of Kirais and Tunegkait, from whom he formed a hezareh. One of his twenty-four sons named Khurtukeh succeeded him as its commander. Another became a secretary in the Khakan\u2019s service; a third, named Tugun Bitikishi, became secretary to Khulagu, while others of the family rose to high rank in the Ilkan\u2019s service (Erdmann, op. cit. p. 237).\nMajor Raverty, I do not know on what authority, tells us that among the tribes assigned by Chinghiz Khan as the portion of his son Chagatai were some Kerait. This seems very probable, for we meet with Kerait in the Tarikh-i-Rashidi and elsewhere. Thus, in the account of Timur\u2019s campaigns there given, he refers to Uzbeg Timur, called Oreng Timur, by Sherif-ud-din, as a chief of the Kerayet who joined Timur. The latter writer says he did so with his Horde. A little later the Tarikh-i-Rashidi speaks of Timur\u2019s troops defeating the Kerayet on the banks of the river Aishek Khatun, called Aishe Kaden, by Sherif-ud-din.\n\nOne of the sons of Abulkhair, the great chief of the Kazaks, was called Kirai or Ghirai Khan, just as the family of the Krim Khans in the Western Kipchak was. As we have seen, there are also clans attached to the Great and Little Hordes of the Kazaks, which are probably derived from the same source.\n\nIn an extract from the Kai thsing i tong chi, made by Stanislas Julien, which gives an account of Sungaria in the middle of the last century, we are told that at Yulduz, S.E. of Kungghes, were the ancient pastures of the Sougars and the Keliyet, i.e. Kerayet (Journ. Asiat. s\u00e9rie 4, tom. viii. pp. 385, etc.). These Kerayet were doubtless the branch of the tribe mentioned by Sherif-ud-din and in the Tarikh-i-Rashidi.\n\nLastly in an account of the Khalkhas in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, by M. Podscyeycf, we read that the third son of Giresandsa Nuhkukho received as his portion two tribes, the Keregut and the Khorlos, showing that a portion of the Kirais remained with the Mongols themselves.\n\nIn regard to the present country of the main body of the Kirais, Levshin, in his history of the Kirghiz Kazaks, says the Kirais or Uvak Kirais encamp on the rivers Ubagan, Ichim, Uya, Taguzac, Irtish, Issel, Sari Su, and Chui, as well as on the sandy wastes of Ich Kungur, the neighbourhood of the lake Kcchu bai, Charkar, and opposite the line between the forts of Stepnoi and Verkhui Uralsk, as well as opposite the forts of Zukrinogolofshoi and Presnogorkofskoi (op. cit. Fr.\nedition, p. 308). This shows how very widespread they have become.\n\nTheir original homeland on the Upper Irtish is, however, where they chiefly prevail, and there they have been studied by Potanin and others. Radde tells us the Kirais live for the most part on the Upper Irtish, under Chinese rule, but also in the more western steppes as far as Verkhui Uralsk. They form three main divisions, the Abak Kirais (the Uwak Kirais of other writers), Kara Kirais and Taraktu. Potanin tells us the Abak Kirais live in the eastern part of the Irtish and Saisan valleys, and the Kara Kirais in the western part.\n\nThe Abak Kirais consist of twelve clans, Jantykai, Jadyk, Shiraiishi, It\u00e4li, Karakaz, Mulku, Shibar-Aigyr, M\u00e4rkit, It\u00e4ugm\u00e4n, J\u00e4s Taban (copper soles), Sary Bas (yellow heads), and Shimoyin.\n\nThe Kara Kirais form three branches, Murun, Bai Jigit and T\u00f6rt Aul (Radde, Aus. Sibirien, pp. 236, 237).\n\nThis completes what I have been able to bring together about the Kirais. As we have seen, in addition to their connection with Prester John, they also formed the most powerful and dominating tribe in the Mongolian steppes at the accession of Chinghiz Khan. In identifying them with the Kirghiz or Hakaz we are able to trace their first occupation of the country which they afterwards dominated, and where, as we have seen, they displaced the perhaps more famous and influential tribe of the Uighurs. Before tracing the history of this last people, I propose to consider that of the kingdom of Pohai, which during a part of the domination of the Kirais controlled the fortunes of Manchuria, and to it I shall devote the next paper of this series.\nArt. V.\u2014The Djurtchen of Mandshuria: their Name, Language, and Literature. By Prof. Terrien de Lacouperie, Ph. & Litt.D., M.R.A.S.\n\nSUMMARY.\n\nI. Their Name.\n\n\u00a7 1. Introductory. 2. It appears under several forms. 3. Testimony of the old Chinese documents. 4. They give an approximate rendering of one single form. 5. Three of the transcriptions indicate a medial r. 6. The Persian, Uigur, Mongol, and Marco Polo confirm the same fact. 7. The original name was Djurtchen or Djurtchi. 8. In Chinese Niutchen becomes Niutehi, because of a tabooed character. 9. Niutchen is an imitation of a K\u2019itan peculiarity of pronunciation. 10. Similar phonetic change in the K\u2019itan language and several ancient Chinese dialects. 11. Phonetic change L=N is most frequent. 12. The forms Niutchen or Niutehi are corrupted, and must be discarded. 13. Remarks on the successive Chinese processes of rendering R in foreign names. 14. Causes of the differences of finals -en and -i. 15. Djurtchen is the sole genuine and best form.\n\nII. Language and Literature.\n\n\u00a7 16. The Djurtchen language lately shown to be only a dialect cognate to the Mandshu. 17. Fresh materials forthcoming from the Hua y yh y\u00fc. 18. Larger connection of the Djurtchen. 19. Its Mandshu relationship known to the Chinese. 20. Not looked upon as narrower. 21. Efforts in view of creating a literature. 22. A Djurtchen dictionary compiled before 1772. 23. British Museum edition of the Hua y yh y\u00fc. 24. A MS. copy in Paris more complete. 25. Dr. Hirth\u2019s MS. copy still more complete. 26. How the vocabularies were improved. 27. Importance of the newly-found Djurtchen documents for Ugro-Altaic linguistics.\nIII. Written Characters.\n\n\u00a7 28. They had two sets of written characters. 29. The large characters and the inscription of Salikan. 30. The Djurtschen, or smaller characters, are not those of Kiu-yung kwan, which are Tangutan. 31. They are those of the Yen t'ai inscription, vocabulary, and texts of the Hua y yh yu. 32. The short-lived writings of Central Asia now less unknown.\n\nIV. Their General Position.\n\n\u00a7 33. The Djurtschen literature has not passed to the Mandshus. 34. The latter made a fresh departure by themselves. 35. The two races were only cousins, though their ruling families may be in a closer relation. 36. The pig-tail of the Chinese called as a witness. 37. Its Mandshu, Djurtschen, and earlier origines. 38. It seems to be the apanage of a hegemonic family. 39. The present Mandshu dynasty, once called Posterior Kin.\n\nIntroductory.\n\n1. This interesting people of Mandshuria occupied an important position in Eastern Asia during the Middle Ages. From A.D. 1115 to 1234 their rulers, under the name of Kin or Golden Dynasty, reigned over the northern half of China, and the all-powerful Mongols only were able to oust them. Unlettered at first, they invented two sorts of writing for themselves, and borrowed a literature from the Chinese. Notwithstanding these efforts, they had passed away beyond recognition. Their language, their written characters, their books, and even their exact name, had disappeared; and it has thus become the task of Orientalists, engaged in archaeological linguistics, to rescue their literary remains out of the dust of ages.\u00b9\n\nTheir history, written in Mandshu at the beginning of the present dynasty of Mandshu rulers of China, who boast of them as their ancestors, was translated successfully in full\n\n\u00b9 One of their original seven tribes, the Sumo, had formed on the north of Corea (in Mandshu Solgo) the state of Puh-hai (exactly Puthai), from A.D. 696 to 926, where the civilization was chiefly Chinese.

Wylie in 1859, and at greater length in 1871, has written about their written characters. Prof. L\u00e9on de Rosny in 1872, and Mr. G. Deveria in 1881, have published learned dissertations on the same subject. It was at last in 1887 that a vocabulary and texts, in one of their own writings, has been found in China by Dr. F. Hirth of Shanghai. Visdelou, Klaproth, and A. Wylie have compiled lists of the words of their language found in Chinese books, and pointed out their close resemblance to the corresponding Mandshu terms. Last year, 1888, Prof. de Harlez again has treated of the same question more scientifically, but he has been less positive than his predecessors.\n\nThus has light been gradually thrown on what was unknown and forgotten. The history, the language, and the writings of the Djurtehen will by and by take their place in the stock of our knowledge of the past, so useful for the future, concerning the history of the human mind and its manifestations in all sorts and conditions of races, countries, and times.\n\nThe present writer wishes that the following remarks may contribute in their small way to that desirable increase of knowledge.\n\nI. Their Name.\n\n2. We must first examine the question of their name, which is interesting under more than one philological aspect. It is variously written and spelt in Oriental literature, as well as by European scholars. Niutchi, Djutchi, Jutchi, Joutchen, each form with several variants, have been and are still in use. A short expos\u00e9 of the historical evidence on the matter will dispel the uncertainty, and show what is the most correct and suitable form to be finally preserved.\n\n3.

Wylie, Prof. L\u00e9on de Rosny, Prof. Ch. de Harlez, and Dr. E. Bretschneider spell Niutchi or Niuchi; De Guignes spells Nutchin; Klaproth, Ed. Biot, Dr. F. Hirth spell Joutchi or Juchi; Dr. Plath, Prof. Vassiliew, M. G. Deveria spell Joutchen or Juchen, etc.\nsearches on the origin of the Mandshus, published by the Han-lin or Academy of Peking, the Emperor K'ienlung, agreeably with earlier Chinese authorities, wrote that \"The Kin originated from the Moho clan in the old territory of Suk shen \u8096\u614e, afterwards Tchu shen \u73e0\u7533.\"\u00b9 The name of the founders of the Kin dynasty has also been transcribed in Chinese Sik shen \u606f\u614e and Tsik shen \u7a1a\u614e.\u00b2 The Sik shen race is mentioned as being in the occupation of the same region North of China since the beginnings of Chinese history, namely, under the reign of Shun; this first entry is perhaps one of the embellishments of later years, which were interpolated in the Annals of the Bamboo Books,\u00b3 where alone it occurs. But the Suk-shen had really some intercourse with the Chinese at the beginning of the Tchou dynasty (eleventh century B.C.), and this intercourse was the subject-matter of one of the lost books of the Shu King,\u2074 according to the summary which Confucius has given as a preface to the work. The Yh Tchou shu,\u2075 in its curious enumeration of presents offered by various surrounding nations to the court of Tching Wang, the second ruler of the Tchou dynasty, mentions a great deer, offered by the Tsik-shen (same as the Suk shen) of the region straight north. They are alluded to in the Ts'o tchuen\u2076 of Ts'okiu Ming, ninth year of Duke Tchao, i.e. 533 B.C. And in the Kwoh yu\u2077 or Talks of the States,\n\n\u00b9 G.

Their name appears also in the Shan hai king,\u00b9 in the writings of Hwai-nan tze,\u00b2 in the She-ki, and other works anterior to the Christian era, in the Annals of the After Han Dynasty\u00b3 (A.D. 25\u2013220), and in various later works. These Annals contain a descriptive notice of them. A Suk-shen kwoh ki or History of the Suk-shen State, was compiled in former times, but it seems to have been lost, and we know it only from quotations in the Tai ping yu lan encyclopedia, which was published in 983 A.D.\u2074\n\n4. All this evidence agrees with the historical fact that a continuous intercourse was kept up between this race and the Chinese until the end of the T'ang dynasty,\u2075 and that the Chinese records have preserved in various spellings its ethnic name. The Chinese sounds Sukshen, Sikshen, Tsikshen, Tchushen are as accurate a transcription of it as is permitted by their clumsy orthoepy.\n\n5. It is to be remarked that in three of these transcriptions the first syllable finishes with a fading consonant, which, in every case, when fully pronounced, was a k.\u2076 This device is the oldest one resorted to, as we shall see hereafter, in Chinese transcriptions of foreign syllables terminated by a consonant like r, formerly missing in their phonology. Therefore we must expect that the genuine appellative was fuller than shown by the aforesaid transcriptions. In the Tu Kin kwoh ichi, or History of the Great Kin State, i.e. the part of China ruled by that dynasty, it is stated\u2077 that the Kin were properly called Tchu-li-tchen \u6731\u91cc\u771f, a transcription in which li stands obviously for r.

The Persian vocabulary of the same College writes the name Tcho-erh-tche \u5353\u5152\u77e5, and Djurdji. The Uigur vocabulary of the same collection writes it Tchu-erh-tech\u00e9 \u4e3b\u5152\u626f and Djurdjog.\\(^2\\) In the Teng t\u2019an pi kiu, a treatise on war, published in 1598, Mr. G. Dev\u00e9ria has found the name written Tchu-erh-tch\u2019ek \u4e3b\u5152\u4ea6, and translated by Ha\u00ef si, \u2018west of the sea.\u2019\\(^3\\)\n\nThe same form of the name finds its corroboration in the Persian authors. Rashid-ed-din, in his remarkable work Djam\u00ee-at-Tewarik, Collection of Annals, dated 1307, mentions it several times as Tchurtche; and Benaketi, in his Tarikh-i-Khata, History of China, dated 1317, says: \u201cThe Kathayans (i.e. the Chinese) call it Niu tche, the Mongols and other people Tchurteche.\u201d\\(^4\\)\n\nThe testimony of Marco Polo will strengthen the series.

Hirth had (7th Sept. 1888) the kindness to communicate to me some instances of this vocabulary, and the present one was among them. In the History of their Dynasty in Mandshu, that which was lately translated by Prof. C. de Harlez, the name is spelt Niotehi, a simple transcription of the Chinese form, which therefore is no proof in the question of the original name. The history here referred to is a part of the Ilan gurun-i suduri, or History of the Three Kingdoms (i.e. Liao, Kin, and Yuen), which was compiled so late as the years 1644\u20131646. On the conditions under which it was written cf. C. de Harlez in Journal Asiatique, 1883, vol. ii. pp. 309\u2013311, and the Manuel de la langue Mandchoue, pp. 227\u2013228, of the same author.\n\n\\(^2\\) G.

The word for \u2018sea\u2019 in Djurtehi is given as lu-tih-lin, Mandshu mederi. On the other hand, the Mandshu dictionary gives Jus\u2019en as a term for \u2018Mandshu servants,\u2019 and also \u2018family people,\u2019 in C. de Harlez, Le Manju gisun-i buloku bithe (Z.f.D.M.G.), repr. p. 2.\n\n\\(^4\\) E.

The considerable number of statements we have been able to quote hitherto show undisputably that so far as concerns the race itself and its congeners, its name was Djurtehen or Djurtehi, the difference between the two being purely grammatical.\n\n8. Now we have to inquire about the name Nintchi, and how it came into use.\n\nThe regular spelling in Chinese is Niutchih or Niutchik \u5973\u771f, since the year 1032. On the accession of the K\u2019itan or Liao king Hing-tsung, whose personal name was Tsung-tehen \u5b97\u771f, it became compulsory to alter the former spelling of their name \u5973\u771f Niu-tchen, because of the pi-huwy or huwy-fah custom. This practice, which is said not to have begun before the Shang dynasty, and which is not yet obsolete, consists in the tabooring of sacred names, such as that of the ruling sovereign; the written characters forming the name are out of use for the time; graphical alterations are made to them, or characters altogether different are used in their stead.\n\n9. The spelling Niu-tchen in Chinese, forcibly obsolete as we have just seen in the year 1032, had come into use some time earlier through the K\u2019itan, who ruled in Northern\n\nSsanang-Szetzen chungtaidschi (St. Petersburg, 1828, 4to.), p. 75.

Soc. 1881).\nChina as the Liao dynasty (916\u20131125). They had begun their incursions on Chinese territory unsuccessfully in 553 A.D., and successfully in 696. And continuing to do so until the final establishment of their just-quoted dynasty, they impeded the regular intercourse which had hitherto existed between the Djurtehen nation and the Chinese, without however stopping it altogether. But these relations had become so difficult and far between, that when a Djurtehen officer came to the Chinese Emperor Tai Tsung, of the Sung dynasty, in 991, asking for his intervention in favour of his people against the aggressiveness of the K\u2019itan, he was met with an absolute refusal, which led to the submission of a part of them to their all-powerful antagonists.\u00b9 Their old name of Suktchen or the like was then duly forgotten, and it is under the name of Niutchen that they are mentioned in Chinese history, from the time of the appearance of the K\u2019itan. Therefore this variation in their appellative seems to have been caused by the latter. This surmise proves to be a fact, as shown in the Annals of the T\u2019ang dynasty, where it is distinctly stated that the K\u2019itan used to call them Li\u00fc-tchen \u616e\u771f.\u00b2 Bearing in mind their oldest name Sultchen, the K\u2019itan variant Li\u00fctchen, and the subsequent Chinese form Niutchen, we have to face two points of phonetic equivalence which are not altogether deprived of interest.\n\n10. The equivalence of li- and ni- for a hissing or hushing consonant might be largely instanceed, and is easily accounted for in physiological phonology. However small the remnants of the language of the K\u2019itan may be, consisting only of some 55 words of Mongol-Tungusie kindredship, we find among them a collateral ease nearly to the point. The K\u2019itan nungku corresponds to the Tungusie nungun, and to the Buriat zorgan;\u00b3 being a clear instance of the equivalence n- = z- in these languages. In the geographical history of Chinese phonetics, I have met many cases of equivalences of L- in the South-East for Teh- and Sh- of the North, North-\n\n\u00b9 Tung kien kang muh, op.c. vol. viii. pp. 116\u2013117.\n\u00b2 K\u2019iu T\u2019ung shu, bk. 199.\n\u00b3 H. H. Howorth, The Khitai or Khitan, p. 4.\nEast, and North-West. And the South-East does not mean further south than Kiangsu and N. Tchehkiang. The old consonant initial *Sh-* preserved in the archaic phonology of the Sino-Annamite dialect, has often become *L-* in Mandarin Chinese. The ancient initials *s-* , *sh-* , *tch-* , *ts-* , still preserved in the less archaic phonology of the Cantonese dialect, have often become *Li-* in Mandarin Chinese. The initial *J-* of Standard Chinese is often pronounced as *L-* in Central Shantung.\\(^1\\) Therefore the phonetic equivalence here alluded to is not unfrequent in these parts.\n\n11. The fact that the *Li\u00fctchen* of the K\u2019itan was written by the Chinese *Ni\u00fctchen* may be easily accounted for by the regional phonetic equivalences between the dialects of the present day. For instance, an original *n-* initial often becomes *l-* at Nanking, and the tendency was formerly more extensive, as in Cantonese, which to a certain extent represents an early phase of the language, and where many words have kept the *n-* of former times. In Western China the change is a regular one. The sound-changes *n=* *l* and *l=* *n* are hard facts in East Asiatic phonology. In Yakut the suffix of plural is *-lar*, with euphonic changes of *l* to *t*, *d*, and *n*; in Turki it is *-lar*, *-nar*, or *-tar*; with the subordination of the vowel to the vocal harmony.\n\n12. The various secondary points involved in a fuller discussion of the forms *Niutch\u00e9n* or *Niutchik* need not be entered into at more length and with more completeness. It is quite clear, from what we have seen, that these forms are corrupted, and henceforth must be discarded.\n\n13. Therefore we must return to the various forms which are wavering between *Suktchen*, *Djurtchen*, and *Djortchog*. The initial being pretty well ascertained to be a hissing or hushing sound, which various transcriptions in different times by several people of diverse races indicate to have been *Dj-* , we have now to examine and ascertain the existence of the medial *r* in olden times. The question comes to this: the Chinese orthoepy in olden times, i.e. before the thirteenth\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. *The Languages of China before the Chinese*, \u00a7\u00a7 55\u201356.\ncentury, having no \\( r \\), how did they represent it in transcribing foreign names? when they wanted to do so, as very often they were satisfied with an *\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s*, and left the \\( r \\) altogether. Their processes of transcription have varied in time. But it would be out of place here to enter into so long a question, for the thorough study of which I have a long time ago gathered some material, in view of a special paper on rhotacism in China. Therefore it will be sufficient here to enumerate the five successive processes in chronological order.\n\nI.) In the oldest time the -\\( r \\)- to be transcribed was supposed to be the final of a syllable, for which equivalence a Chinese syllable finishing with -\\( k \\) was selected. Acting in this way, the Chinese scribes were only true to a not infrequent sound-change in the Ugro-Altaic languages. For instance, Turk *dokus* (\u062f\u0648\u06a9\u0648\u0633), Tchuwash *turuch*, \u2018nine\u2019; Turk *yumurta* (\u06cc\u0648\u0645\u0631\u062a\u0627), Tungusic *umukta*, \u2018egg\u2019; Mongol *setser-lik* and *tsetsek-lik* \u2018nursery,\u2019 *dorokshi* and *doghokshi* \u2018away,\u2019 etc.\\(^1\\) Therefore the transcriptions *Suk-shen*, *Tsik-shen*, for a name somewhat like Sur-shen, Tsir-shen, were as appropriate as could be.\n\nII.) About the time of the Christian era, in the names of Central Asia a medial \\( r \\) was rendered in the same conditions as previously, but with a syllable finishing in -\\( n \\).\\(^2\\)\n\nIII.) Afterwards the influence of the Buddhist missionaries from India brought some changes. A more accurate transcription was sought for, and the \\( r \\) medial was looked upon as forming a syllable by itself, or being an initial of another instead of a final. The most approximate sound of Chinese phonology at the time, i.e. \\( l \\), was taken as a regular substitute.\\(^3\\)\n\nIV.) The subsequent process was purely Chinese, and introduced as a simplification; it was a return to the former systems, which looked upon the \\( r \\) always as a final syllable.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. Wilhelm Schott, *\u00dcber das Altaische oder Finnisch-Tatarische Sprachengeschlecht*, p. 118.\n\n\\(^2\\) I am glad to see that Dr. F. Hirth has independently arrived at the same conclusion in his *China and the Roman Orient*, p. 139.\n\n\\(^3\\) The *M\u00e9thode pour d\u00e9chiffrer et transcrire les noms sanskrits qui se rencontrent dans les livres Chinois*, by Stan. Julien, is full of such instances. As initial \\( r \\) was rendered simply by \\( l \\ldots \\) or by \\( a-l \\ldots \\) or \\( ho-l \\ldots \\). Cf. *ibid.* p. 53.\nBut the Chinese scribes had learned something of the physiological classification of sounds introduced among them by the Buddhist missionaries, though in many respects this classification is better fitted to the phonetic characteristics of an Indo-European language than to their own Chinese sounds. Instead of syllables in the *j\u016b sh\u0113ng* with a fading *k* final, they selected thence such syllables with a fading *-t* final.\\(^1\\)\n\nV.) The Mongol conquest in the thirteenth century has exercised a considerable influence on the Chinese sounds of the Northern provinces. One of the most striking was the passing of the three syllables rendered by \u975e, \u8033, \u5152, originally *mi*, afterwards *nji*, and at the time *ji*, to *erh*. This phenomenon solved the difficulty, and henceforth all the *r* of foreign names were transcribed by one or the other of these three symbols, and most generally by the third one.\n\nNone of these processes could supersede and cause the disappearance of the former systems, as tradition preserved the old spelling of well-known names, which were beyond the reach of innovation.\n\nWe have pointed out in the case of the name of the Djurtchen the application of the first process in olden times. I do not know any instance of the second, but the third process is exemplified in *Tchu-li-tchen*,\\(^2\\) and the fifth was applied in the spellings *Tcho-erh-tche*, *Tchu-erh-tch\u00e9*, and *Tchu-erh-tch\u00e9k*.\\(^3\\)\n\nThe existence of a medial *r* in the original form of the name, even in the Chinese garb of the oldest transcriptions known to us, cannot therefore be doubted.\n\n14. Four different finals have appeared in the various transcriptions of the name. They are *-n*, *-i* or *-\u00e9*, *-g* or *-k*, and *-d*. The latter is simply a Mongol form, and occurs in *Djuritchid*, a form of the name as quoted in Mongol history. It is the dental suffix vocally harmonized to the stem, corre-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Dr. F. Hirth, in his paper on *Chinese Equivalents of the letter R in Foreign Names* (*Journ. China Branch Roy. Asiat. Soc.* vol. xxi. pp. 214\u2013223), has collected many such instances. The learned author does not mention the first and fifth of the five processes here described.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf. \u00a7 5.\n\n\\(^3\\) Cf. \u00a7 6.\nsponding to the Mandshu -ta, -te, Esthonian -t, Mordvin -t, Ostiak -t, etc., which in Mongol takes the place of a final -n.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe -g or -k appears in the Uigur dictionary of the sixteenth century, and in several Chinese forms, the oldest of which dates from the eleventh century. There is no doubt also that this is a plural final foreign to the original name, but I am not ready to affirm under what immediate influence. The phenomenon is not unknown in the Ugro-Altaic languages, as we find it in Magyar and in Lapponic.\n\nThe -i or -\u00e9 final is probably incomplete, and a shortened form of the regular plural in the Tungusic group to which the Djurtchen belonged.\\(^2\\) In the standard dialect, the Tungusic Nyertchinsk, the sign of the plural is -r after the dropping of a final -n. But it may simply be the form in which both Tungus and Mongols could agree in speaking of the Djurtchen,\\(^3\\) since their grammatical law required for both languages the disparition of the final -n of the original word and the addition of -r or -d respectively.\n\n15. Therefore the ground is now made pretty clear. We have been able to ascertain that while the form Niutchi and similar ones are really corrupted, the other finals than -n are foreign to the original name. We may assume that, judging from the Mandshu, its nearest congener, the language of the Djurtchen did not make an absolute necessity of adding special affixes for the plural. Besides, let us remember that in the fragments of their vocabulary the final -n is preserved in the quotation of their own name. The spelling to be used, which answers to all that we know of the matter, must be Djurtchen and no other.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) For instance, the Tun-hang or Tungwan, forming the kingdom of the Si-hia in N.E. Tibet on N.W. China, between the years 881 and 1227, became the Tangut of the Mongols.\n\n\\(^2\\) The same thing occurred with the Liao or K'itan Tungus, who ruled over the northern part of China between the years 907 and 1225. Their name has become K'titai, which is now the Russian appellative of China.\n\n\\(^3\\) For all these grammatical forms, cf., for the sake of convenience, the grammatical recensions in James Byrne, General Principles of the Structure of Language, vol. i. pp. 352-473. L. Adam, La d\u00e9clinaison Oural-Alta\u00efque, pp. 247-258 of Revue de Linguistique, tomo iv. E. do Ujfalvy, Etude compar\u00e9e des langues Ougro-Finnoises, in Revue de Philologie, tome i. And the special grammars of the languages spoken of.\nII. LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE.\n\n16. It is well known that the present dynasty of China is of Mandshu origin, and claims as its parents the Kin or Djurtschen dynasty, which ruled over Northern China in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, although the latest investigation on the matter by Dr. De Harlez shows their linguistic relationship to be more of a collateral than of a direct character.\\(^1\\) The learned Professor of Louvain has carefully examined all the Djurtschen words which have been met with in the Chinese sources by Visdelou and Wylic. And the result of his careful comparison and study is, that out of 110 words: ten only can be found identical in Mandshu, whilst thirty are much like as many Mandshu words, but generally with suffixes somewhat different; fifty are altogether different from the corresponding words in Mandshu. A list of seventy-five proper names, collected by the same scholar, shows that forty-two might be explained by Mandshu words. As a conclusion, Prof. De Harlez says that \"the Mandshus belong to the same ethnic family as the Niu-tchis (?), but they are not their direct descendants. Their language is closely connected with that of the Niu-tchis, the two being equally dialects of one and the same language, but these dialects are quite distinct, and present great discrepancies and at the same time great similarities.\"\\(^2\\) We are certainly safe in adopting these conclusions, based upon the scanty materials in Chinese dress at the disposal of the author.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Niu-tchis et Mandchous, rapports d'origine et de langage (Journal Asiatique, 1888, 32 pp.).*\n\n\\(^2\\) The Djurtschen language, so far as we can judge from the Chinese transcripts of its words, possessed the same degree of harmonization of vowels as its kindreds the Mandshu and Tungus languages. This remarkable phenomenon of the Turano-Scythian languages at large in various degrees, first pointed out with reference to the Ugro-Altaic languages since 1845 (Dr. J. L. Otto Rohrig), 1849 (same author), 1850 (L. Dubois), has been studied with care by M. Lucien Adam in 1874, from a functional point of view. In a recent paper by Herr Josef Grunzel, *Die Vocalharmonie der Altaischen Sprachen* (Wien, 1888), attention has been duly called to the physiological attractions of the vowels as an explanation of the phenomenon. Prof. Victor Henry, the successor of the lamented Abel Bergaigne in his chair of Sanskrit in Paris, has rightly remarked (*Revue critique*, 18 Feb. 1889), in his recension of the paper, that the vocalic attractions in their activity must find a resistance or a help in the respective force of the classes of consonants.\n\n\\(^3\\) *Niu-tchis et Mandchous, p. 31.*\n17. But in my opinion we must not press too much the question, until we have at hand the new materials promised by Dr. F. Hirth, of Shanghai, who has been able to get in China a complete and perfect manuscript copy of a precious work, the *Hwa-Y yh y\u00fc*.\u00b9 This work consists of vocabularies and documents in eight foreign languages, published formerly by the *Sze Y Kwan*,\u00b2 the College of Interpreters at Peking.\u00b3 One of the vocabularies consists of 881 words in the Djur-tchen language and writing, with the Chinese transcription and translation.\u2074 Dr. Hirth tells me that he intends to publish it very soon in facsimile, so as to permit its thorough study and decipherment by scholars acquainted with Mandshu. The announced publication of this extensive vocabulary will permit the decipherment of one of the unknown writings of the Djur-tchen, and of the inscriptions and texts written therewith.\n\n\u00b9 \u83ef\u5937\u8b6f\u8a9e.\u2014This work was begun as early as 1389. In the year 1382, under the Yuen dynasty, a Mongol named Ilwo-yuen-Kieh, was commanded to translate some Mongolian texts. He wrote in 1389 a work in two volumes called *Hwa Y yh y\u00fc*. This dictionary, Chinese and barbarian, is said to have been completed afterwards by the Persian division of the College of Interpreters. It was preceded by a preface from the pencil of Liu San-wu, and was composed on the same system as a previous work of the same kind, *Mung-Ku yh y\u00fc* due apparently to the same Hwo-yuen-Kieh. (From a MS. note kindly communicated to me by M. G. Dev\u00e9ria, lately Secretary of the French Legation at Peking, who has collected a large quantity of notes in view of a history of the College of Interpreters.)\n\n\u00b2 \u56db\u5937\u9928 under the Ming dynasty. Now it is called \u56db\u8b6f\u9928.\n\n\u00b3 Established in 1407. The languages taught there were Tartarie (Mongol) Djur-tcheu, Tibetan, Sanskrit, Persian, Pai-y, Uigur and Burmese. Seven students in 1469 and twelve in 1483 were in the Djur-tchen class. M. G. Dev\u00e9ria, gives me also the following information on a work in his possession (MS. note). In 1580, Wang tsang tsai, a former administrator of the college, and governor of the Kiang-si province, wrote in two vols., called *Sze Y Kwan K\u2019ao*, \u201cResearches for Use at the College of Interpreters,\u201d some historical notices on the peoples, which the students of the College must study, \u201cnotices,\u201d says the author, \u201cwhich ought to be placed at the beginning of the special vocabularies of each class of the College,\u201d *pien y\u00fc k\u2019oh kwan yh y\u00fc tehi shou*. As every section of the work of Wang tsang tsai corresponds to one of the ten classes of the *Sze Y Kwan* where the Djur-tchen formed the fifth class, M. G. Dev\u00e9ria concludes that printed vocabularies of the various classes existed already under the Ming dynasty. This distinguished Sinologist thinks, that the work of the same title, published after 1695 or in 1749 by Kiang-fan, described in the Imperial Catalogue (K. \u00a73, f. \u00a72) and quoted in fragments by P. Amiot, is the same work, with addition of an appendix, containing the petitions which have been copied by the Missionary for the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, and suppression of all that concerned the Mongols and Djur-tchens.\n\n\u2074 F. Hirth, *The Chinese Oriental College*, pass., and *Journ. China Br. R.A.S.*, vol. xxii. p. 207, April, 1888.\n18. With the help of these documents, we may expect soon some more information about the Djurtehen language. The dialectal relationship advocated by Prof. De Harlez, instead of the parentship with the Mandshu thought of by previous scholars, will be strengthened or shown to consist only in the variants which may be found anywhere when taking a language at two distant periods of its existence, especially in the case of a language still unfixed by literature. The literary period of the Djurtehen did not last long, and could not have exercised a sufficient influence to crystallize the forms of the language, and secure its predominance over its co-dialects. Many Djurtehen words have a wider kindredship than the Mandshu. For instance, wolito 'tent, court,' Mandshu ordo, is the same word as the K\u2019itan wuluto and Mongol ordu.\u00b9 The words ancun 'gold,' hishilie 'high,' for which Prof. De Harlez has no Mandshu kindreds, are certainly, albeit their Chinese garb, allied to the K\u2019itan nauku and azra, which have the same meanings.\n\n19. The relationship of the Djurtehen language to the Mandshu was known to the Chinese, as shown by the following fact. During the reign of Kien-lung, new editions of the histories of the K\u2019itan or Liao, Djurtehen or Kin, and Yuen or Mongol dynasties, were issued, with extensive changes made in the spellings of the proper names therein, according to the views of the committee of editors. These changes have made the Kienlung edition unserviceable for historical and geographical investigations, and it was forbidden by imperial edict to employ in future any of the original spelling when quoting these names.\u00b2 In 1781 the Emperor ordered the same committee to explain the meaning of the names in their new spelling. It is reported that they employed\u00b3 the Mandshu for the names of the Djurtehen, the dialect of the Solons\n\n\u00b9 The Urdu of India.\n\u00b2 Cf. E. Bretschneider, Medieval Researches from Eastern Asiatic Sources, vol. i. pp. 181-182.\n\u00b3 Sze k\u2019u-tsuau shu tsang muh, G. Dev\u00e9ria, op.c. p. 175. The Liao Kin Yuen shih y\u00fc kiai, which was compiled for that purpose, gives also the original spelling of the names. Cf. E. Bretschneider, ibid.\nfor the names of the K\u2019itan,\\(^1\\) and the Mongol for those of the Yuen dynasties.\n\n20. But if the Chinese knew of the relationship, did their behaviour towards the Djurtchen show that they did not consider it as close as a parentship to the Mandshu? We doubt greatly that their linguistic capabilities should have been equal to the emergency. The cumbrous system of the Djurtchen characters was all the difference to them. It seems most likely that when their dynasty was overthrown by the Mongols, those of the Djurtchen who returned to their northern steppes and nomadic life soon lost the light varnish of culture which they had acquired while in contact with the Chinese. Their influence on their sister tribes in language and race came therefore to naught. The Djurtchen characters however continued to be taught by the Chinese until 1658 at the College of Interpreters at Peking, but they were then a dead language, as a hundred years had elapsed since Djurtchen envoys had been interpreted by the eight special teachers of the College.\\(^2\\) The event of 1557 shows that these characters lived more than four centuries, and therefore had outlived the actual writing of the Yuen-Mongol dynasty, the Bashpa characters. The latter had dragged along a scanty existence of some eighty-five years,\\(^3\\) without having even reached any literary existence; and this, notwithstanding the mighty power of the Emperors of the Mongol-Yuen dynasty, which happened to be less strong than the hold of the Uigur alphabet was on the writing community, as they were compelled to adapt\n\n\\(^1\\) The Solons (a Mongol name meaning \u2018shooter\u2019), also called Manyaros (cf. the Turkish menyak \u2018prince\u2019), on the upper waters of the Amur, claim to descend from the ancient subjects of the Kin dynasty; cf. H. H. Howorth, *The Ethnology of Manchuria*, p. 21 (*The Phoenix*, 1871, vol. ii.). A very intelligent Solon has assured Mr. H. H. Howorth that his language was different from either Mandshu or Mongol. Cf. H. H. Howorth, *The Northern Frontiers of China*, V. *The Khitai or Khitans*, p. 7 (*J.R.A.S.* April, 1881).\n\n\\(^2\\) In 1658 the Tartar and Djurtchen languages were abandoned as branches of the college, because these two languages were henceforth taught in the schools of the Mongol and Mandshu banners then included in the Empire (G. Dev\u00e9ria, MS. note) or because, for the Mongol, there was less difficulty since the accession to the throne of a Mandshu family, and for the Djurtchen, its literature was then extinct.\n\n\\(^3\\) A.D. 1269-1354.\nit to the requirements of their language in the years 1307\u20131311.\n\n21. The Djurtschen rulers had made powerful efforts to develope literary taste among their people, and resist the Chinese encroachments in that respect. We see, for instance, their fifth ruler (Kin dynasty), She-Tsung Ulu, attempt repeatedly in the years 1173, 1176, 1185, and 1187, to promote the study and maintenance of their own language and writing. In 1197 Tchang Tsung Madagu reiterates the same enactments concerning the use of the national writing. Special schools were established in the years 1164, 1171, 1173, 1188, etc., with a regular system of examinations by gradual degrees, in imitation of the Chinese organization. Translations were made of important Chinese works. For instance, in 1164 the Annals of the Taug dynasty were translated in this way; the Chinese text was first translated in the small Khitan characters, and afterwards transcribed in Djurtschen characters. Let us remark that such a process would have been impossible with any other system than that of ideographic symbols. And at the same date the Shu-King was translated in the great and small national characters. A translation of the Annals of the Western Han appeared in 1176. The Hiao-King, Yh-King, Lun-yu, the works of Mengtze, Laotze, Yangtze, Wentchungtze, and the History of the Posterior T'ang dynasty, were translated and distributed. A catalogue of the Chinese Imperial Library during the Ming dynasty gives a list of fifteen Djurtschen works therein, which show that the translations were still more extensive than that. Not having the original text within my reach, I can only judge through the transcriptions of the Chinese symbols of the list. These are the Kia-y\u00fc, the Peh kia sing,\n\n---\n\n1 In 1151 their fourth ruler, Wan-yen-liang Digunai, had established a central college in imitation of the famous Kioh tze Kien of the Chinese. Cf. De Harlez, Histoire de l'Empire de Kin, p. 85; De Mailla, Histoire, vol. viii. p. 550.\n\n2 Cf. C. De Harlez, ibid, pp. 129, 136, 156, 166.\n\n3 G.

The possession of such works would be most valuable, and some may perhaps still be found in the private libraries so numerous in China. But all the titles show that there was no national literature, no original author; all the works, with the exception of the pedagogical last two, are translations from the Chinese.\n\n22. The Emperor Kienlung, who published in 1772 a new and enlarged edition of the great Mandshu Chinese Mirror (such is the name of the Mandshu dictionaries), of which the first edition had been issued in 1708, states in his introduction that a dictionary, or dictionaries, of the languages of the *Kin* and of the *Yuen*, compiled by his orders, had been published.\\(^1\\) The recovery of this Djurtehen dictionary is highly desirable, but I do not find it mentioned anywhere else. It is perhaps that of which a MS. copy has luckily fallen into the hands of Dr. F. Hirth, though his vocabulary is one of those published by the College of Interpreters, where, as we have seen, the teaching of the Djurtehen language had been discontinued in 1658. This scholar thinks for that reason, and because the linguistic documents therein belong to the period of the Ming, that the original work is somewhat older than the aforesaid date. He may be right, but then his MS. copy would be that of an enlarged edition. Indeed the work seems to have been published several times.\n\n23. The British Museum has recently acquired a printed copy of the work through Dr. Edkins, in a dilapidated and almost illegible condition. Missing folios have been supplied in MS. It contains the following vocabularies:\n\n\\(^1\\) The statement has been translated by Prof. C. de Harlez, *Niu-tchis et Mandchous*, p. 30, as follows from the preface of the *Miroir augment\u00e9 de la langue Mandchoue*: \"J'ai donn\u00e9 l'ordre,\" says the Emperor Kien-Lung, \"de composer un dictionnaire explicatif des langues des royaumes de Kin et Mongol...

But we may remark, however, that these volumes belong to another edition, probably earlier than the two other editions we know of the same work. The number of words, not to speak of the languages, is smaller; for instance, it contains about 820 Uigur words only, against 914 and 988.\n\n24. In the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale of Paris, the MS. copy,\u00b2 sent by Father Amiot in the last century, is more complete and consists of sixteen tomes in seventeen volumes, nine of vocabularies and eight of documents, of the Ming period. Besides the six languages above named, there are two more, Sanskrit (very short) and Siamese.\n\n25. Now the MS. copy belonging to Dr. F. Hirth is the most extensive; ten volumes of vocabularies and fourteen of documents. Two languages more are given in vocabularies and documents, the Mongol, otherwise the language of the Yuen dynasty, and the Djurtchen of the Kin dynasty. These are the very two languages mentioned in 1772 by the Emperor Kienlung as those of which dictionaries had been compiled and published by his orders. Surely it cannot be a coincidence. The differences that we know of between the work\n\n\u00b9 They are classified by order of matter, beginning as usual with heaven, earth, seasons, etc.\n\u00b2 List Stan.

The copy in the British Museum was not mentioned there, because it was entered after the composition of that work.\nrepresented by this MS. copy and those represented in Paris and London do not come from incompleteness of the two latter. There is between the three copies a gradual increase in the number of words, as shown by the figures we have given of the Uigur words. The arrangement also is different; in the Paris copy the Tibetan vocabulary is divided into two volumes, while in Dr. Hirth\u2019s copy it occupies only one, but probably as large as the other two.\n\n26. We know something of these improvements of the vocabularies of the College of Interpreters, which existed partly in 1580. In 1748, by order of the Emperor Kien-lung, printed copies were sent to the proper governors of provinces, in order that they should be verified and corrected.\n\n---\n\n1 None of the three copies show the original order or the vocabularies.\n2 A.

Il existe d\u00e9j\u00e0 des recueils de ces diff\u00e9rentes litt\u00e9ratures, il convient de les mettre en ordre et de les r\u00e9viser en sections par ordre de mati\u00e8res et en former ensuite un tout selon ce qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour le Tib\u00e9tain. . . . On nous pr\u00e9sentera ensuite les copies manuscrites de ces recueils, puis enfin on les remettra aux bureaux des Coll\u00e8ge des Interpr\u00e8tes o\u00f9 ils t\u00e9moigneront de la prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9 des litt\u00e9ratures r\u00e9n\u00e9es (du polyglottisme).\u201d When the *Ta Ts\u2019ing hwei tien* was compiled, the editors have remarked at this occasion that the College of Interpreters preserved writings of ten nations: *Huy-huy* or Persian; *Kao-tehang* or Uigur; *Si-fan* or Tibetan; *Si-tien* or India; *Sien-lo* or Siam; *Mien-tien* or Burma; *Pai-yi*, a Shan people; *Pa-pan* or Shans of Xiengmai; *Su-lu*, and Wan-shang or Laoeian of Vien-chan. In 1810, the revisers of the Great Encyclopedia of Administration discovered a manuscript work containing these ten sorts of writings, and formerly the property of the College of Interpreters, to which it was returned by Imperial command. M. G. Dev\u00e9ria, has had the good fortune of purchasing in Peking in 1879 a MS. work which answers to the description, and according to all possibilities is the very one spoken of. It is called the *\u6703\u540c\u56db\u8b6f\u9928\u5404\u570b\u756a\u5b57\u66f8* (*Hwei tung sze yh kuan k\u2019oh kwoh fan tze hua*), in thirteen volumes, containing ten vocabularies of the languages quoted above. The dates are indicated for the Siamese 1577, Sulin 1755, and Laoeian 1762.\u2014Mr. G. Dev\u00e9ria, from whose MS. note I have derived the above information, has been kind enough to send me a specimen of twenty-six words of the Sulu vocabulary. I find them to be exact representatives of the language of the Sulu archipelago on the N.W. of Borneo, with which the Chinese were in relation already under the Ming dynasty (cf. *Ming she*, k. 325). It is reported there that in 1417, the Eastern and the Western Kings (i.e. Kings of E. and W. Sulu) and the King of Klaibatangan (of N.E. Borneo) came to the Chinese court. For further details, cf. the extracts translated\nIt must have been a difficult task to perform in some cases, as, for instance, for the Djurtchen, which was apparently extinct. But there is no indication that such a vocabulary existed previously; it may have been compiled to complete the series, and this would explain the special notice made by Kienlung of such a vocabulary compiled by his orders.\\(^1\\)\n\n27. The bilingual documents, Chinese and Djurtchen, contained in the above-mentioned complete copy of the *Hica-y yh y\u00fc* are most promising for the study of the language and for history. Dr. Hirth states that they consist of twenty memorials. In these texts he has found mention made of several years in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; one address speaks of the sixty or seventy years which have elapsed since the reign of Tcheng-t'ung (A.D. 1436 to 1450).\\(^2\\)\n\nThe publication of these documents, like that of the vocabulary, is most desirable. We may therefore expect that their language will not long remain unknown to comparative philology, and we may say that it will be a most welcome and valuable contribution to our scanty knowledge on documentary evidence of the Ugro-Altaic languages in former times. We have some Mongol texts of the thirteenth century, and some Uigur ones of the tenth. Chinese literature has preserved for us the shadows of Turkish words of the fifth century, and, what is more astonishing, and probably still unknown to many, some Corean words of the second century before our era. Besides, we must go to the Magyar known in the twelfth century, or then to more remote languages of the same stock and families, such as the Japanese seventh century, the Medo-Scythic of the sixth century B.C., and the Sumero-Akkadian dialects very much older. The close connection of the Djurtchen language of the twelfth and fourteenth centuries to the Mandshu, known only in the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In the *Yh she k'i y\u00fc* of 1696? reprinted in the *Lung-wei-pi-shu* of 1794, sect. ix., there is a Mongol vocabulary, along with others of the Persian, Pai-y, Ugric, Burmese, Papeh, Sanskrit, and Tibetan languages. The Tibetan part contains 740 words in 20 sections, covering 103 pages. The Sanskrit is represented by 42 Devanagari characters.\n\n\\(^2\\) F. Hirth, *The Chinese Oriental College*, p. 216.\nseventeenth, makes it peculiarly interesting in the view of the natural evolution of these languages.\\(^1\\)\n\n### III. WRITTEN CHARACTERS.\n\n28. The Djurtchen had two sets of written characters; the Large characters made up of the calligraphic elements of the Chinese *Kiai-shu*\\(^2\\) or pattern-hand characters, and about a thousand in number, were issued by decree in the eighth month of 1119, and ordered to be generally used. The second set of characters was framed in 1138 by the Emperor of the Kin-Djurtchen himself, and brought into use officially in the fifth month of the year 1145, as the Djurtchen characters;\\(^3\\) after 1191 it was the sole writing in use.\\(^4\\)\n\n29. The Large Djurtchen characters, which were little more than an adaptation and selection of the K\u2019itan characters,\\(^5\\) are represented by the bilingual inscription of the Lang-kiun\n\n---\n\n1 The Djurtchen language must take its place in the Tungusian group, Mandshu division, which according to recent investigations is no part of the Altaic class of the Ugro-Altaic languages. According to Dr. Heinrich Winkler: *Uralaltaiische V\u00f6lker und Sprachen*, Berlin, 1884, p. 479, and *Das Uralaltaiische und seine Gruppen*, Berlin, 1885, who has more deeply studied the subject than previous writers, these languages, in consequence of their grammatical elements, must be divided otherwise than before, namely, into two large groups: 1) Mongol-Turk; 2) Finno-Samoyed-Tungus-Japanese. Therefore the general classification of the Turano-Scythian stock given in my *Languages of China before the Chinese*, \u00a7 231, must be thus far rectified with reference to these two groups:\n\n1) *S.W. Asiatic*: Sumero-Akkadian, &c.\n2) *Uralic*: Ugro-Finnish; Samoyed; Tuugusic; Japanese.\n3) *Altaic*: Turkish; Mongol.\n4) *K\u00fcentunic*: Kotte; Chinese; Tibeto-Burmese.\n5) *Himalaic*: Dravidian; Gangetic; Kolarian; Andaman; Australian.\n6) *Kush-Caucasic*: N. Caucasian; Alarodian; etc.\n7) *Euskarian*.\n\n2 *Kin she*, bk. ii. f. 14; *Hung kien luh*, bk. 214, f. 14; *Shu she huy yoo*. A. Wylie, *Ancient Buddhist Inscription at Kiu-yung Kwan*, p. 37 (*J.R.A.S.* Vol. V. 1870). G. Dev\u00e9ria, *Examen de la st\u00e8le de Yen-tai*, Dissertation sur les caract\u00e8res d\u2019\u00e9criture employ\u00e9s par les Tartares Jou-tchen, p. 174 (*Revue de l\u2019Extr\u00eame Orient*, vol. i. 1882).\n\n3 *Kin she*, bk. iii. f. 27; *Hung kien luh*, bk. 215, f. 13; A. Wylie, *ibid.*; cf. my *Beginnings of Writing*, \u00a7\u00a7 108\u2013109.\n\n4 The *Aisin gurun-i suduri bithe*, translated by Prof. De Harlez, *Histoire de l\u2019Empire de Kin ou Empire d\u2019Or* (Louvain, 1887), mentions slightly the first of the two writings, p. 35, and says nothing of the other.\n\n5 Only five characters of the K\u2019itan writing have been preserved as such, in the *Shu she huy hiao* or \u2018History of Writing,\u2019 and in the Topography of the Tcheng-teh Prefecture. Cf. A. Wylie, *Inscription of Kiu-yung Kwan*, o.c. p. 37, and G. Dev\u00e9ria, *St\u00e8le de Yen-tai*, o.c. p. 177. To these must be added those of the engraved fish-badge in the possession of Dr. S. W. Bushell, which were much like the writing of the Lang-Kium inscription in Large Djurtcheu character, but there\nSalikan in 1134, published several times already in Europe, and of which the real nature, contents and date are known by the Chinese version. But the separate value of the characters has not yet been recognized.\n\n30. As to the Djurtcchen characters, also called the Small, in contradistinction to the Large, no certainty existed as to their real nature. A. Wylie thought them to be one of the six written languages of the Buddhist inscription of Keu-yung Kwan in Northern Tchihli, erected in 1845, and he published them accordingly in 1870. But this identification was a mistake. My friend Dr. S. W. Bushell, of Peking, came into possession of the squeeze of an inscription from Shensi province, described as written in the characters of Si-Hia, or Tangut, and he was able to identify these characters with the unknown ones of the inscription of Keu-yung Kwan. This similarity looked suspicious, and Mr. G. Dev\u00e9ria, in 1882, in publishing the inscription of Yen-t'ai, near K'ai fung fu, (Honan) in another writing also unknown, was on the right path in casting doubts on the attribution proposed by Wylie. The question, however, can no more be a matter of uncertainty, as the legends of the well-ascertained coins of the kingdom of Tangut (N.E. Tibet and N.W. China) from the precious\n\nis no certainty in this statement, as we do not know exactly whether this specimen was K'itan or Djurtcchen, though it appears from the records that the Djurtcchen at the beginning of their dynasty have made use of K'itan characters. The fish-badges was an old institution among these races. The Puh-hai of the N.W. (cf. supra, \u00a7 1, n. 1) used to bestow fish-badges in gold or silver. Wells Williams, in his Syllabic Dictionary, p. 119, describes \"Fei Kin y\u00fc, a prince royal among the K'itans, because he wore a fish made of gold,\" but I do not know his authority for this interesting statement. In the K'ang hi tze tien, 195, f. 1, a quotation is given from the Kin she, y\u00fc fuh tchi, from which it appears that the relatives of the Djurtcchen King, as far as the fourth degree, wore a jade fish, which badge in the latter case was made only in gold, while the relatives of a more distant rank were simply entitled to a silver one. Now the specimen which was in the hands of Dr. Bushell, neither in jade, gold or silver, was 2\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) inches in length, \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) inch in width, one side convex, ornamented with scales inlaid with silver, the other flat, with the engraved inscription of which he kindly sent me a rubbing (27 May, 1881). M. G. Dev\u00e9ria, who has seen the object in question, writes to me (24 March, 1889) that it was the half incuse of a seal of command, implying the existence of another half with the same inscription in relief to fit in the former.\n\n1 Neumann, Asiatische Studien, 1837, p. 41.

That the latter was written in ancient Devanagari, Utchen Tibetan, Bashpa Mongol, Uigur, Tangutan, and Chinese characters, must now be looked upon as an ascertained fact.\n\n31. On the other hand, what could be the writing of the Yen-t\u2019ai inscription? The characters, though much like the Large Djurtchen of the Lang-kiun inscription, are certainly much more simple; while on the latter stela the characters are generally twofold, as if composed of two signs, those of Yen-t\u2019ai are simple and do not present the same double appearance. Mr. G. Dev\u00e9ria suggested that they might be either the Small K\u2019itan or the Small Djurtchen characters. It is the last suggestion which I find to be the true fact. Dr. F. Hirth has already published some specimens of the Djurtchen characters from the vocabulary of his MS. copy of the *Hwa y yh y\u00fc*.\\(^2\\) Now these specimens numbering thirty-six different characters, show unmistakably that they belong to the same set of characters as that of the inscription of Yen-t\u2019ai, which therefore must be looked upon as a monument of the proper Djurtchen writing. Its decipherment will be now possible, after the publication of the Djurtchen vocabulary and the identification of the characters individually.\n\n32. This recovery of a Djurtchen vocabulary in the Small character clears singularly the ground about several of the various writings which the unlettered Tartar nations, coming into contact with the civilized, or at least lettered, countries of China, Tibet, and Ugric lands, were compelled to have invented for themselves. The present state of our knowledge on the subject is still deficient, as may be seen from\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) There are two specimens in the British Museum. Dr. S. W. Bushell had himself two in his private collection, of which he had kindly sent me some rubbings. Some are figured by Li Tschien, in his remarkable numismatic work *Ku Tsuen hui*, sect. li, bk. xv, f. 8. They were issued between the years 1049\u20131120. Cf. my *Beginnings of Writing*, \u00a7 104.\n\n\\(^2\\) Dr. F. Hirth was on a wrong track when, in the paper (p. 209) already referred to, he expressed as his opinion that the characters of his Djurtchen vocabulary were the same as those of Keu-yung kwan, which he does not seem to have seen at the time.\nthe following explanatory list of these six writings, all short-lived in Central Asia in the Middle Ages:\n\nA.D. 920. The K'itai or Liao Tartars. Large characters, several thousands. Not ten are known. Small characters. Unknown.\n\nA.D. 1030. Tangut or Si-Hia. Writing now identified. Represented by coins and the inscription of Keu-yung kwan (7th version).\n\nA.D. 1119. Djurtehen or Kin Tartars. Large characters, about a thousand. Partly known and deciphered. Inscription of the Liang-kiun Salikhan.\n\nA.D. 1145. (Same.) Small characters. Just identified; undeciphered. Vocabulary of 881 words (Dr. F. Hirth). Inscription of Yen-t'\u00e4i.\n\nA.D. 1269. Yuen or Mongol. Bashpa characters, 41 in number. Known and deciphered. Coins, inscriptions, and texts. A syllabary in Dr. S. W. Bushell's possession.\n\nIV. Conclusion.\n\n33. The efforts of their rulers, which we have alluded to, never succeeded in making the Djurtehen a literary people. The knowledge of writing was most probably the share of a class, and not of the mass, as they never were able to issue a coinage with legends in their own characters,\\(^1\\) as the Tanguts, the Mongols, and the early Mandshus have done. However, we must remember that the Chinese contrived to have teachers and interpreters of Djurtehen at their College of Interpreters until 1658, and this not without purpose, though no occasion of the official utility of these interpreters is quoted after 1558. Towards the end of the same century (\\(i.e.\\) 1582) the Chinese claim to have played the part of peacemakers and honest brokers between the three divisions into which the Djurtehen were then separated.\\(^2\\)\n\nAfter the overthrow of their dynasty\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) They began to issue coins in 1156, but with Chinese legends.\n\n\\(^2\\) According to De Mailla (vol. x. p. 341) their three divisions were located as follows: 1) the unsubdued Niutchi used to trade east of Kai-yuen; 2) the Peh-kwan Niutchi near Tchin Pehkwan; 3) the Nan-kwan Niutchi near Kwang-tehung-kwan.\nfrom Northern China in 1234, they had withdrawn generally northwards of the Liao tung province, and the bulk of them were thus on the west of the seat of the Mandshus.\n\n34. The latter claim to have reached something of a political unity, on the immediate south of the Long White Mountain (Tehang peh shan)\\(^1\\) under a chieftain of the name of Aisin gioro, or Golden Gioro, whose personal character is rather legendary. Whatever proportion of Djurtchen tribes the Mandshus\\(^2\\) may have swallowed up in their actual and subsequent concentration, it is quite clear that they did not inherit much of their literary culture, if any at all. They had fallen under the influence of the Mongols, and it was the language of the latter, and therefore their written characters, which were used for the political relations. The great convenience and strength of the Mongol alphabet and syllabary, which had proved stronger than the imperial power of Kubilai Khan and his successors, assumed once more its hold; and in A.D. 1599, when their ruler Tai Tsu Dergi wanted a special writing for his people, there was no question of reviving the old Djurtchen characters, which they might have attempted to do if this writing had been that of their immediate ancestors. They seem to have ignored it altogether, and it is the Mongol writing which they were required simply to adapt.\n\n35. The Djurtchen and Mandshus descended from one single trunk, but they had diverged in course of time, and the position of the former towards the latter seems to me simply that of elder cousins. As to the claim put forth by the Chinese Emperor K'anghi that he was a descendant of the royal family of the Kin dynasty, by the Wangtai, or chief of the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This famous mountain has recently been described by Mr. H. E. M. James in the record of his special journey, *The Long White Mountain*, or *A Journey in Manchuria* (London, Longmans, 1888). Long White Mountains is the translation of the Chinese Tehang peh shan. On our maps the name is Shan Alin Mountains, where I beg to remark we have the same word in three languages: Shan is mountain in Chinese, Alin is mountain in Mandshu.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf. Manju in the Manju gisun-i buluku bithe, extract published by Prof. C. de Harlez, p. 2. Also by the same author, *Manuel de la langue Mandchoue*, p. 5. Mr. Edward Harper Parker has contributed to the *Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan*, vol. xv. part i. pp. 83-92, an article on *The Manchus*, about their various tribes past and present, but he does not give any authority for his statements, some of which are peculiar.\nNan-Kwan Djurtehen, there is no impossibility in the fact, without implying the identity of the two peoples. An argument in favour of this view may be found in the present pigtail or hairdressing of the Chinese.\n\n36. It is well known that the pien-tze or tiao-pien is comparatively a recent introduction. It was imposed upon them by their conquerors the Mandshus, for whom it was a national and distinctive fashion in 1627, when they had just begun their conquest of China, and were still in the northern province of Liao-tung or Shing-king. In so doing they were only repeating what their kindred predecessors, the Djurtehen, had done in 1129. All the subjects of the state had been then forbidden to wear the Chinese costume, and ordered to submit to their style of tonsure, under penalty of death.\n\n37. From the present Mandshus, the practice cannot be traced back direct to any other people than to the Kin-Djurtehen, and therefore it looks somewhat like a heirloom in direct descent. Going further back, we can trace, though not exactly, the ascendant line, as one reference only to such a peculiar custom is made in the descriptions of one of the probable ancestral tribes of the Djurtehen. We find a description of it, at a much earlier date, namely, in Chinese documents of about 285 A.D., as peculiar to the Mo-huy tribe in the north of Liao-tung. In this tribe of the Tungusic family, and therefore kindred in the ancestral line to the Djurtehen and Mandshus, the men used to shave their heads and leave only a tuft of hair on the top, which they looked upon as an ornament. Their Tungusic parentage described\n\n---\n\n1 De Maille, vol. x. p. 406. P. Gaubil, Histoire de Gentchis-Kan, p. 87.\n2 This style of tonsure consists of shaving the hair all round the head, leaving only to grow to their full length and plaiting in one cue the hairs of the top of the head.\n3 Wells Williams, The Middle Kingdom, vol. i. p. 761.\n4 Li tai Ti Wang nien piao, Nan Sung, f. 17.

The Yu-wen and the Mo-huy are described together, but the hairdress is specially described as that of the Mo-huy.\n6 Hou Wei Shu. The text runs thus:\n\n\u83ab\u69d0\u4e4b\u4eba\u7686\u7fe6\u9aee\u800c\u7559\u5176\u9802\u4e0a\u4ee5\u70ba\u98fe.\nin the *Peh she*, and the similarity of their name *Mo-huy* to that of the *Mo-ho*,\u00b9 *Mu-ki* (Wu-ki mod.), one of the ancestral tribes of the Djurtchen, show their kinship with the more modern followers of this curious fashion. In the intricacy of all these tribes, Tungusic, Turkish, Mongol, Corean and Sienpi, and the numerous interminglings which occurred between them, any clue may be of help.\n\n38. The aforesaid fashion is so peculiar that the Chinese writers have carefully described it when they knew of it, and as it is not mentioned with reference to any other tribes, nor is it alluded to as proper to the hegemonic family, though it looks as if it were so, we must accept it only as an indication of a close kindredship of the two races, and a closer link between the ruling families.\n\n39. The kinship of the Mandshu rulers with the ancient Kin dynasty was looked upon by the founders of the present dynasty of China as suggesting a revival of the old dynastic appellative, and at the beginning they took for themselves the name of *Kin posteriors*\u00b2 (in Pekinese *Hou-Tchin*), but other counsels prevailed afterwards, and the name of *Ts\u2019ing* \u201cpure\u201d (in Pekinese *Tch\u2019ing*), was finally selected.\n\n\u00b9 Cf. supra, \u00a7 3, and C. de Harlez, *Histoire de l\u2019Empire de Kin*, p. 2.\n\u00b2 \u201cDr. E.

Nassau Lees, LL.D., Ph.D., who died in London, on the 9th March, at the age of 64, was the youngest son of the late Rev. Sir Hareourt Lees, and brother\nof Sir John Lees, the present Baronet. He entered the Bengal Army in 1845, and became a Major-General in 1885; but for some years before his death he had resided in England, and his name was borne on the unemployed supernumerary list. Although an Arabic scholar of considerable repute, he was perhaps better known for his Oriental work in India than in England. At different periods of his service he filled the several appointments of Principal of the Calcutta College (madrasah); Examiner in Persian and in Muhammadan Law, and Persian Translator to Government; Professor of Law, Logic, Literature and Mathematics; Examiner in Arabic at the Muhammadan Colleges of Hugli and Calcutta; and responsible referee on the language qualifications of civil and military officers.\n\nAs regards his literary labours, the following is quoted from the *Athen\u00e6um* of the 16th March:\n\n\"The Arabic publication for which his memory will be more particularly honoured by scholars is, perhaps, the 'Commentary' of Az-Zamakhshari, so much esteemed among Sunnis. Of those devoted to Persian authors, the 'Nafah\u00e1tu 'l-Uns' of J\u00e1m\u00ed (a notice of celebrated Sufis and saints modernized from an older chronicle), and the interesting 'V\u00eds u R\u00e1m\u00edn' of Fakhru 'd-d\u00edn As'ad Jurj\u00e1ni, which Dr. Rieu describes as 'the poetical version of a romance originally written in Pehlevi,' are worthy the attention of both scholars and dilettanti.\n\n\"Besides the above, there are in the Royal Asiatic Society's library the 'A'taris i Buzurg\u00e1n' (A.D. 1855), or an obituary notice of Muhammadan doctors, edited by W. Nassau Lees and Maulavi Kabiru 'd-d\u00edn Ahmad; the 'History of the Khalifs' (A.D. 1856), by Abu'l Fadhl 'Abdu 'l-Rahm\u00e1n Jal\u00e1l\u00fa 'd-d\u00edn bin Abi Bakr us-Suy\u00fati, with (same year) a 'Book of Anecdotes, Wonders, Pleasantries, Rarities, and Useful Extracts,' by Al Kuly\u00fabi, with both of which Nassau Lees had to do; and (A.D. 1868) the 'Alamg\u00edrn\u00e1mah,' by Muhammad Kazim Ibn i Muhammad Am\u00edn Munshi, edited by Maulavis Kh\u00e1dim Husain and 'Abu 'l-Hai, 'under the superintendence of Major W. N. Lees, LL.D.'\n\"Not the least remarkable of his many contributions to serial literature is an article called 'Materials for the History of India for the 600 Years of Muhammadan Rule previous to the Foundation of the British Indian Empire.' This appeared in the second part of vol. iii. of the Asiatic Society's Journal, published in 1868, and, although written more than twenty years ago, it opens with a thoughtful review of the relations of the natives of India to their English superiors, which might be studied with advantage at the present day. The information contained in the body of the paper is of a very valuable kind, and if only the impetus to Asiatic research and the study of Oriental tongues, which recent action on the part of the London Asiatic Society was intended to give, were sufficiently real to culminate in revival, its republication, with some additions and modifications, would be desirable.\"\n\nTo the above may be added a contribution to the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal \"on the application of the characters of the Roman Alphabet to Oriental Languages,\" and six papers published in the Proceedings of the same society, entitled:\n\n- On the Muhammadan Conquest of Arabia (1865).\n- On the Ikbal Nameh-i-Jahangiri and other authorities for the reign of the Emperor Jahangir (1865).\n- On Double Currency (1865).\n- On the Oriental Colleges at Lahor (1866).\n- On Scientific Technology (1866).\n- On the Maasir-i-Alamgiri and Khafi Khan (1868).\n\nBefore the proceedings of the Society became separated from the Journal\u2014as done in 1865\u2014he had already contributed notes on the following subjects: An Arabic Stone Inscription from Mirzaganj; the \"Saraffins\" and their connection with the English Sovereign; the Romanizing of Oriental alphabets; the Muhammadan Historians of India; the origin of Hindi and its relations to the Urdu dialect; and the derivation of the numismatic term \"sovereign.\"\n\nIt is, moreover, shown in the \"Centenary Review of the researches of the Bengal Asiatic Society,\" published in 1885,\nthat Ensign Lees, so far back as 1853, brought out an edition of the Arabic Fat\u00fahu\u2019sh-Sh\u00e1m, or account of the Muslim Conquest of Syria by Ab\u00fa Ism\u00e1\u2019il Muhammad bin \u2018Abd Alla Al Azdi Al Ba\u1e63ri; together with the pseudo-Wakidi\u2019s work on the same subject. He also edited, in conjunction with Maulavis Abdu\u2019l Hak\u1e33 and Ghulam K\u00e1dir, the Nakh-batu\u2019l Fikr, with the Commentary called Nuzhatu\u2019n-Nazar, by Shah\u00e1bu\u2019d-d\u00edn Ahmad Ibn Hajar al Askal\u00e1ni; and was one of many editors of the Isabah, or biography of persons who knew Muhammad, by Ibn Hajar.\n\nIn addition to the Persian works mentioned by the Atheneum, he supervised the printing of Mr. Morley\u2019s edition of the T\u00e1rikh-i-Baih\u00e1ki, and in part superintended the publication of Maulavi Saiyid Ahmad Khan\u2019s edition (1868) of the T\u00e1rikh-i-Firuz Sh\u00e1hi, by Ziy\u00e1u \u2019d-D\u00edn Barani. An interesting account of this history of the Muhammadan sovereigns of India will be found in the third volume of Dr. Rieu\u2019s Catalogue of Persian MSS. in the British Museum.\n\nHe was, besides, joint editor (1863) of the Tabak\u00e1t i N\u00e1siri, by Minh\u00e1ju \u2019d-d\u00edn al Jurj\u00e1ni; and (1864) of the Muntakh-abu\u2019t Taw\u00e1rikh of Abdu\u2019l K\u00e1dir Bad\u00e1uni, stated by Dr. Hoernle to be second, as a history, \u201cto none in the whole range of historical works by Muhammadan authors.\u201d And the publication of the Ik\u0331b\u00e1l n\u00e1meh-i-Jah\u00e1ngiri, of M\u2019utamid Khan, and of the B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h N\u00e1mah of \u2018Abdu\u2019l-H\u00e1mid Lahauri was indebted to his superintendence.\n\nGeneral Nassau Lees had been a Member of the Royal Asiatic Society for more than sixteen years, having joined it in 1872.\n\nIV. Notes and News.\n\nMSS. from Burma.\u2014Mr. James George Scott, of the Burma Service, has found time, in spite of the arduous duties of his frontier post, to collect and send home to his brother, Mr. John Scott, Fellow and Bursar of St. John\u2019s College, Cambridge, a very valuable selection of P\u0101li, Burmese, and Shan MSS. Among the former are the P\u0101tika Vagga of the great\nD\u012bgha Nik\u0101ya, complete; a complete copy of the Yamakas; a portion of Buddhaghosa's well-known commentary on the D\u012bgha entitled the Sumangala Vil\u0101sin\u012b; and the whole of the Attha S\u0101lin\u012b, his first work written in India, which gained him the favour and support of the leaders of the Buddhist order. There is also a copy of the S\u0101rattha Dipani Tik\u0101, an important medi\u00e6val treatise on Buddhist Canon Law, written in Burma, and the MS. of a considerable treatise, hitherto unknown, on Buddhist ethics, called the Ma\u1e47i-S\u0101rama\u00f1j\u016b\u1e63\u0101. Professor Rhys Davids and Professor Carpenter have published, for the Pali Text Society, the first volume of the Sumangala Vil\u0101sin\u012b. With that exception all the above Pali books are unedited. Among the Burmese books is a translation of the celebrated 'Questions of Milinda,' in which the Greek king Menander discusses Buddhist ethics with the Elder named N\u0101gasena. The Shan MSS. are written in the Burmese character on a sort of thick paper, but, except as to the Buddhist invocations at the beginning of them, no one, probably, in Europe can read them. The beauty of their execution shows, however, that the Shans cannot be so wild and uncivilized a people as is often supposed. If Mr. Scott could spare time to tell us something of their contents, we should be duly grateful.\n\nProfessor Minayeff, of St. Petersburg, has borrowed from the Royal Asiatic Society its MS. of the Bodhicary\u0101v\u0101tara, a Sanskrit Buddhist work on the attainment of the Supreme Bodhi or insight, with the object of editing this work for the Pali Text Society.\n\nMr. Bunyiu Nanjio, formerly of Oxford, and the author of the excellent catalogue of Chinese Buddhist Books issued by the Clarendon Press, has returned to Tokio in Japan from his travels in India, and has nearly finished his projected edition of the Saddharma Pundar\u012bka, 'The Lotus of the Good Law,' well known from the translations into French by Burnouf, and into English (for the Oxford series of 'Sacred Books of the East') by Professor Kern of Leiden.\n\nJapan.\u2014There has been formed at Tokyo a Society called the 'Niphon Bukkho,' for the combined study of Eastern\nand Western Philosophy, more especially in respect to religion. It prints translations into Japanese of European works on psychology, and Japanese works on Indian (and more especially Buddhist Indian) and Chinese philosophy. Dr. Bunyiu Nanjio, late of Oxford, and now lecturer on Sanskrit at the University of Tokyo, deals with Buddhist books in Pali and Sanskrit; Mr. Yoshitomo Tatsumi, of the Shin Shu College, with general philosophy, and Mr. Tokunaga with the philosophy of religion. Mr. Tatsumi has already published an analysis, in Japanese, of Spencer\u2019s \u2018First Principles\u2019 (a copy of which is now in our Library), and other works are in the press.\n\nIn the second number of the \u2018Bijou of Asia,\u2019 edited by Mr. Matsuyama, of the \u2018Buddhist Propagation Society\u2019 (Senkio Kwai) at Kioto, there is a \u2018Brief Outline of Buddhism in Japan,\u2019 including a discussion of the real meaning of the expression \u2018Nirv\u0101\u1e47a.\u2019\n\nAdmission into the Buddhist Order.\u2014The \u2018London and China Telegraph\u2019 of February publishes an account, given by an eye-witness, of what it is pleased to call \u2018the form and manner of ordaining priests and priestesses of the sect of Buddha.\u2019 There is neither priest, nor priestess, nor ordination in Buddhism. But it is interesting to notice that while the ceremonies observed have grown considerably in length and importance, the simple form of words by which men and women alike were admitted, 500 B.C., into Gotama\u2019s Order of Mendicants, is still adhered to in China, without much change or much enlargement. The ancient P\u0101li form of words as used in India was translated by Professors Rhys Davids and Oldenberg in vol. i. of their \u2018Vinaya Texts.\u2019\n\nIndian Vegetable Drugs.\u2014Two army doctors, William Dymock and C. J. H. Warden, are preparing, in conjunction with Mr. David Hooper (the quinologist to the Madras Government), a work entitled \u2018Pharmacographia Indica,\u2019 containing an account of all the principal vegetable drugs to be met with in British India.\n\nMahomedans in Ceylon.\u2014The District Court at Kalutara, in Ceylon, had recently to investigate a case in which the\nthree local Mahomedan sects had fallen out about the use of a mosque. These were the Kadiri sect, which observes strict silence in all their devotions; the Sadiri, akin to the Howling Dervishes, which consider shouting and violent antics as the necessary accompaniments of their worship; and the Idurns, which recommend decency and order in a reasonable service of prayer. Although these sects differ from each other in what may be designated special devotion, yet they all agree in general worship carried on in the mosque in which sectarian differences were for the moment forgotten in identity of ritual.\n\nBut of recent years these sects became more pronounced and ambitious in their peculiarities, and sought to perform in the mosque devotions which were formerly carried on in a sort of oratory called a Thackya. The plaintiff was a priest of the temple, and alleged that he had been riotously dispossessed by the defendants who belonged to a rival sect. The point which it was hoped to settle by the case was whether the defendants had the right to appoint and dismiss priests; but under the Roman Dutch law which prevails in Ceylon, if a man in possession for a year and a day is violently ejected, he has the right to restoration until a decree of the Court is obtained against him, as this is the only means after such quiet possession by which he can be dispossessed. Accordingly the priest was restored by order of the Court, but this leaves the main question still unsettled. During the trial much of the ritual employed by the Mahomedans in Ceylon in their Sabbath services on Fridays was explained. The service begins with the Muezzin's call to prayer. On the arrival of the Thateeb, or officiating priest, at the mosque, one of the Lebbes (assistant priests) walks before him with a staff in his hand to the pulpit, and there recites the Makhar, or call to silence. The Thateeb then mounts the pulpit and preaches the Khotuba, or a homily on the doctrines of the Koran. Whoever does the preaching is called the Imam. The sermon over, the staff-bearer recites the Khamat, or a call to rise and prayer, on which all the congregation who have been seated during the exhortation bestir themselves to join in the service proper, in which the officiating priest\ntakes the lead. At the conclusion of the service the Dhekiya or additional devotions are performed. The Mohideen is a mosque officer corresponding to the Sacristan of Christian churches. The priests are all appointed from one family called the Mahlam.\u2014(Allen's Indian Mail.)\n\nProf. Tawney is preparing a translation of a Jain collection of stories entitled the Katha Kosa.\n\nProf. B\u00fchler contributes the following letter to the Academy of March the 9th, pointing out the principal results obtained from Dr. Burgess's new squeezes of the A\u1e63oka Inscriptions.\n\nVienna, February 25, 1889.\n\nDuring the working seasons of 1866\u201387 and 1887\u201388, Dr. Burgess undertook at my request the preparation of new impressions of the Girn\u00e2r, K\u00e2lsi, Sh\u00e2hb\u00e2zgarhi, and Mansehra versions of A\u1e63oka's rock-edicts, and handed them over to me in the course of last summer. Other pressing work prevented me utilising them at once, and I finished deciphering them only last week. These new impressions have been taken with scrupulous care and consummate skill on strong Indian country paper, on the reverse of which the letters are visible in relief, from $\\frac{1}{8}$ to $\\frac{1}{4}$ of a centimetre high. Particularly difficult or doubtful passages have been done twice or even thrice over.\n\nThe results which these new materials yield are very valuable. It is possible to make with their help numerous corrections even in the comparatively speaking well-preserved Girn\u00e2r and K\u00e2lsi versions. In the former they even exhibit some signs which both M. Senart and myself have failed to detect on the stone. Their importance for the Sh\u00e2hb\u00e2zgarhi and Mansehra versions is, as might be expected, much greater. They enable me to give a complete and intelligible text even of the difficult hitherto not explained passage of the thirteenth edict, which is fully preserved in Sh\u00e2hb\u00e2zgarhi alone. As the restoration of this passage is, perhaps, the most important service which the new impressions render, I give it in extenso. The words for the greater part lost in the other versions are:\nYo pi cha apakareya ti chhomitaviyamate vo devanain priyasa, yaim \u0161ako chhamanaye. Ya pa chi atari devanain priyasa vijite bhoti, ta pi anuneti, anunijhape ti. Anutape pi cha prabhhave devanain priyasa. Vuchati tesha, kiti? avatrapeyu na cha hain\u00f1eyasu. Ichhati hi devanain priyo savrabhutana achhati samyamain samachariyani rabhasiyec. Esha cho mukhamate vijaye devanain priyasa yo dhramavijayo.\n\nThe close translation of these sentences should be in my opinion as follows:\n\n\"And if anybody does [me] an injury, the Beloved of the gods holds that it is necessary even [then] to forgive what can be forgiven. Even on [the inhabitants of] those forests which are in the dominions of the Beloved of the gods, he takes compassion [when it is suggested to him], that he should destroy [them] one after the other; and the power of the Beloved of the gods [would] even [suffice] to torment [them]. Unto them it is said\u2014what? 'They shall live contentedly and not be slain.' For the Beloved of the gods desires for all creatures freedom from hurt, self-restraint, impartiality, a state of joy. And the Beloved of the gods holds this conquest to be chiefest, to wit, the conquest through the law.\"\n\nThe general sense is just what one would expect, as \u0100\u015boka has declared in the preceding that he regards with horror even a hundredth or a thousandth part of the atrocities perpetrated by his armies during the conquest of Kali\u1e45ga. The use of the word atari \"the forests\" for \u0101tarik\u0101h \"the men of the forest, the jungle-tribes,\" is curious, but analogous to that of amit\u0101 \"the frontiers\" for \"the neighbours.\" Rabhasiyec is an interesting \u1f00\u03c0\u03b1\u03be \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd; it is evidently the Sanskrit r\u0101bhasyam, which, according to Ujjvaladatta on Un\u0101lis\u016btra, i. 117, means \"a state of joy.\" This meaning fits very well and closely agrees with the sense of the various reading madava or m\u0101davai found in K\u0101lsi and Girn\u0101r. Some other passages of the Sh\u0101hb\u0101zgarhi version, such as Ed. iii. l. 6, and Ed. ix. ll. 19-20, which have remained inexplicable even after M. Senart's late revision of Edicts i.\u2013xii., come out quite correctly.\nThe Mansehra version, too, becomes perfectly readable. A score or so of signs, sometimes four or five consecutively, are gone in Edicts i. and ii., and single ones here and there in Edicts iii. and ix.\u2014xi. But the losses are unimportant. In the beginning of Edict v. this version has preserved an important word which is lost in Girn\u00e2r, Dhauli, and Jaugada, and indistinct in the older K\u00e2lsi facsimiles. M. Senart has already recognised that its first three letters are adika. Dr. Burgess\u2019s impression gives plainly adikare and that of the K\u00e2lsi edict not amdihute, as I had read formerly, but \u00e1di[ka]le. Adikare-\u00e1dikale is equivalent to Sanskrit \u00e1dikarah, which etymologically means \u201cthe beginner, the originator,\u201d and is known from the Koshas as a name of the creator Brahm\u00e2. It also corresponds with the Jaina epithet of the T\u00eerthanikaras, \u00e1dikaro or \u00e1digaro, for which in Jaina Sanskrit texts \u00e1dikarta appears. In As\u2019oka\u2019s inscription the word has its etymological meaning. We read in\n\nMansehra: Kalanain dukarain, Ye adikare kay\u00e2nas\u00e2 se dukara\u00ee karoti.\n\nK\u00e2lsi: Kay\u00e2ne dukale, E \u00e1di[ka]le kay\u00e2nas\u00e2 se dukale kaleti.\n\nThe translation is:\n\n\u201cGood [works] are difficult of performance. He who is the originator of good [works] accomplishes something difficult of performance.\u201d\n\nAs\u2019oka means to say that he has done something particularly difficult, as he has first appointed the overseers of the sacred law and otherwise taken care that the law will be kept; and, as he has first done much for the happiness of his subjects, the task of his successors, whom he exhorts in the sequel to follow his example, will be much easier.\n\nThe new impressions yield also important pal\u00e6ographical results. They show that several letters of the North Indian alphabet have interesting varieties of form. They also reveal the use of a double ma in the word sammapratipati. This mma appears in three passages in that shape, which it has in the facsimile of the Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, Plate ii. l. 5. They finally prove that Sir A. Cunningham was right in\nreading asti, striyaka, samstuta, and so forth. The signs for tha and tha are very different from that for sta, which plainly shows its origin from a combination of sa and ta.\n\nI trust that it will be possible to prepare readable facsimiles of the northern versions according to these new impressions, and that the original sheets will, like the impressions of the Dhauli and Jaugada versions, eventually be taken over by the British Museum, and thus be made accessible to all students of Indian palaeography.\n\nG. B\u00fchler.\n\nDr. Morris in the Academy of March the 23rd makes the following remarks:\n\nWood Green, N., March 12, 1889.\n\nP\u0101li students are greatly indebted to Prof. B\u00fchler for his valuable and interesting contribution to the Academy of March 9. I should, however, like him to reconsider his translation of avatrapayu in the Sh\u0101hb\u0101zg\u0101rhi inscription. Dr. B\u00fchler evidently derives it from trp with ara, but there are difficulties in connecting it with this root. It should, I venture to think, be referred to trap \u201cto be abashed,\u201d and be rendered \u201cthey shall shun (or eschew) evil deeds.\u201d Then the concluding clause, \u201cand not be slain,\u201d is rendered more forcible than if the translation of the first clause were \u201cthey shall live contentedly.\u201d Avatrap does not, I believe, occur in Sanskrit; but we need it in order to explain (1) the P\u0101li verb ottapati (not in Childers, but see Majjhima Nik\u0101ya, vol. i. p. 356, ed. Trenckner) \u201cto be fearful of sinning,\u201d which presupposes a form avattapati=avatrapati, and (2) the noun ottappa=avattappa=avatr\u0101pya, connected by Childers with a Sanskrit antt\u0101pya from utt\u0101p. In the Journal of the P\u0101li Text Society for 1887, I have called attention to the Northern Buddhist apatr\u0101pya=P\u0101li ottappa, which occurs in Mah\u0101vyutpatti (p. 32, ed. Minayef). This, of course, must be from apa-trapati, which in P\u0101li might become avattapati or ottapati; but I suspect that apatr\u0101pya is an attempt of a Northern Buddhist translator to Sanskritise the P\u0101li ottappa. Not knowing avatrapati, he would naturally refer it to the more ordinary form apatrpati.\nWhile on the subject of Northern Buddhist terms, I may mention that the Sanskrit *utsada*, in *saptotsada*, unexplained by the editors of the *Divy\u0101vad\u0101na* (see pp. 620-621) is the first element of the P\u0101li *sattussada*, discussed by the present writer in the *Journal* of the P\u0101li Text Society for 1887.\n\nRichard Morris.\n\nMr. D. G. Margoliouth has been appointed to the Laudian Professorship at Oxford, vacant by the death of Dr. Gandell about a year ago.\n\nAlberuni\u2019s India.\u2014Under the title of \u2018Indo-Arabische Studien,\u2019 Professor Sachau has published in Berlin (Georg Reciner) a paper he read before the Berlin Royal Academy of Sciences, on the mode in which Alberuni reproduces in Arabic characters the Indian words (astronomical or philosophical terms, or names of persons, places, and books), of which he thought it better to give, as nearly as he could, the original sounds. The whole of the Indian words so given are systematically considered, and general conclusions are drawn as to Alberuni\u2019s method of transliterating such letters. In the course of the enquiry, which is throughout most thorough and complete, very interesting disclosures are made as to the probable pronunciation of Indian words by the Pandits who assisted Alberuni, and much light is thrown on the growth and development of language in India. And the whole investigation is the more important, as the date of Alberuni\u2019s work is so accurately known.\n\nThe \u2018Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Acad\u00e9mique Indo-Chinoise de France\u2019 has been reorganized, and the officers of the Society now are: President, the Marquis de Crozier. Vice-Presidents, MM. Paul Leroy Beaulieu (Member of the Institute), Jacques H\u00e9brard (Member of the Senate), S. de Heredia (Member of the Chamber and ex-Minister), L\u00e9on Feer (of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale), and Eug\u00e8ne Gilbert, who is General Secretary of the Society. Secretaries, MM. de la Tuque and A. R. Ravet. Treasurer, M. Lepesquucur. Besides the above there are thirteen Members of Council. The office is at No. 44, Rue de Rennes, Paris.\nThe Town Council of Hamburg has founded a scholarship of \u00a375 a year at the 'Orientalisches Seminar' at Berlin, for a mercantile student to be selected annually by the Council.\n\nWhile the Pali Text Society has been doing useful work in the canonical and religious literature of Southern Buddhism, it is interesting to note some activity in Ceylon in printing the grammatical literature of Pali. First editions of the three following works have appeared at Colombo in the last four years: 1. Kaccayana-bheda, 1886. 2. B\u0101lappabodhana, 1887. 3. Padas\u0101dhana, 1887. 4. \u00c7abdabindu, 1888.\u2014C.B.\n\nThe \"Ko-lao Hui\"\u2014a Chinese Secret Society.\u2014A recent Consular Report from China describes the origin and working of a notorious secret society called the Ko-lao Hui, which for many years past has given much trouble, and which quite recently has caused much commotion in Nankin and its neighbourhood. This Ko-lao Hui is described as a society \"somewhat resembling the Socialists of Europe, and much dreaded by the officials and people of China.\" It originated during the Tai-ping rebellion among the soldiers in Hunan for the purpose of affording aid to the wounded and the families of the men killed on service. The Hunan men served all over China, and their mutual aid society spread by their assistance over the whole country. The aims of the society developed with its growth, and a sentiment of equality of worldly possessions and position became prevalent among its members. It is much in vogue with the soldiers coming from Hunan, but recent events have attracted the serious attention of many civil and military officers of high rank, most of them Hunan men themselves, and they intend to purge the society of the evil principles which it has of late years adopted.\n\nMr. Giles has brought out his \"Chuang Tz\u016d: Mystic, Moralist, and Social Reformer, translated from the Chinese\" (London, Quaritch). In the Introduction he gives a short account of Chuang Tz\u016d, of his system, and of the most important of the editions of the treatise which goes under his name. After the Introduction we have a very interesting\nnote by the Rev. Aubrey Moore of Oxford. In this note a parallel is drawn between certain of the teachings of Chuang Tz\u016d and those of Herakleitos. Mr. Giles has evidently devoted much time and study to Chuang Tz\u016d. He has produced a translation which is pleasant to the reader, and gives us an insight into the strange opinions of the great Taoist mystic. We do not pretend to pass any judgment on the merits of the book as a translation. The Chinese original is supposed to present many difficulties of interpretation, not only to the Western student but also to the native scholar, however learned. But Mr. Giles is acknowledged to stand among the first of living Sinologues, and he is widely read in all the learning of ancient Taoism. The notes which he has interspersed throughout the translation are very useful, some as giving information, and others for their parallel passages from Western authors.\n\nMr. Clermont Ganneau has been elected a member of the \"Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres.\"\n\nToram\u0101\u1e47a.\u2014The coins of this H\u016bna chief, who succeeded the Gupta Dynasty in their western dominions early in the sixth century, are well known (see for instance above p. 136). Mr. O'Dwyer, the acting Deputy Commissioner of Shahpur, has now discovered an inscription of Toram\u0101\u1e47a recording gifts to a Buddhist monastery. The slab is now in the Lahore Museum.\n\nMahomedans in Java.\u2014The Dutch Government have commissioned Professor C. G. Hurgronj\u00eb of Leiden (the learned author of \"Mekka,\" of which the second volume has just appeared) to proceed to Java on a scientific mission of enquiry into the history and customs more especially of the Mahomedans there. He left by the Brindisi route on April the 1st.\n\nThe new Buddhist Relics.\u2014Mr. J. M. Campbell, of the Bombay Civil Service, whose discovery of the Buddhist relics at Sopara nearly ten years ago made a sensation in the antiquarian world, has again been singularly fortunate. In another Buddhist mound, some six miles south-east of the city of Junagadh in Kattywar, he has unearthed another series of caskets, containing it seems certain more veritable\nrelied of the \"divine pessimist, Gautama Buddha,\" who flourished more than six hundred years before Christ, and whose followers are still more numerous than those of either of the other two great religious creeds. The new mound, or the \"Girnar mound,\" as it will be known among antiquaries, is nearly three times as large as the Sopara Mound, being between 80 and 90 feet high instead of 27, and about 230 yards round instead of 65. But in position, character, and detail they are so much alike that in all probability they date from the same time, namely, about 150 B.C., or some 500 years after the death of Gautama Buddha. We leave Mr. Campbell to describe in his own picturesque language the excitement of the chase. The work of excavating the tower lasted for three weeks, and has only just been crowned with success. In the middle of January the explorers were getting disheartened when a cobra was unearthed. In India the guardianship of buried treasure is always supposed to be one of the peculiar provinces of the cobra. The native workmen set to work with renewed vigour, and the not very intelligent interest of the local public was revived. Here we must borrow a line or two from Mr. Campbell:\u2014\"A few days after the disappearance of the guardian cobra and his refusal to be charmed, the boys' schools in Junagadh town became almost empty. Mothers were keeping their boys at home as it was rumoured fifty boys were to be sacrificed to the great cobra to coax him into showing the thirty lakhs of treasure of which he was trustee, and which were wanted by the State for railway extensions. The attendance at the schools remained low for several days.\" Mr. Campbell, after another series of vicissitudes, did not, it is true, unearth the thirty lakhs of treasure, but on the 16th January he found what he probably thinks much more valuable, the relic box or coffer of which he was in search. This stone box measures 1 ft. 2 in. square and 9 in. deep. Having opened it, Mr. Campbell came to a reddish clay-stone casket, which, in its turn, contained a small copper casket or bottle, green with verdigris, almost round in shape, and measuring $1\\frac{1}{2}$ in. in all directions. The copper casket held a silver casket, $1\\frac{3}{10}$ of an inch high,\nand $1\\frac{7}{6}$ across at the broadest, and the silver casket held a small round spike-topped gold casket, bright and untarnished in spite of its 2000 years, and in shape and size like a small chestnut. The gold casket is $\\frac{13}{6}$ of an inch and $\\frac{7}{8}$ across. In this tiny bowl were seven tiny articles\u2014four precious stones, two small pieces of wood, and a fragment about the size of one\u2019s little finger nail of what seems to be bone\u2014\"the item,\" says Mr. Campbell, \"in whose honour and for whose protection against evil these six precious things had been placed in the gold casket, for which the gold, silver, copper, and stone covers had been laid in the stone box, and for which the 80 feet high and 100 yards broad mound had been raised round the coffer.\" The microscope will tell us whether it is bone, or stone or clay, but until the experts are called in, we shall continue to believe with Mr. Campbell that the relic must have belonged to some one held in the very highest reverence by the builders of the mound\u2014that is, to Gautama Buddha himself. All the scientific world agreed that the choice crystal casket of the Sopara Mound contained what had, when it was buried, been regarded for five centuries as a fragment of the begging-bowl used by Buddha himself, and here there is little doubt that we have another relic of the same age and equal interest.\u2014Madras Times.\n\nDestruction of an Ancient Dagoba at Kandy, Ceylon.\u2014Yesterday, a dagoba was broken up by the temple authorities. In the middle was found a large shrine, dagoba-shaped, $5\\frac{1}{2}$ feet in length, the circumference at the base measuring $8\\frac{1}{2}$ feet, and the whole being made of brass. At two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Mr. Crawford, the Assistant Government Agent, with Mr. Moir, went to this Dew\u0101le, and in their presence the brazen shrine was opened. They found in it about 50 golden images of Buddha, each about two inches in height, seven karanduas, each six inches high, one a large one, and precious stones. The shrine stood on a slab of rock measuring about $4 \\times 3$ feet, and when this foundation was removed, they came upon a square chamber beneath it, well plastered with lime. In this chamber were found precious stones, small gold coins (varagan), three karanduas (relies),\nthree large stones, also a crystal shrine in which were placed very small relics. The floor of the chamber was another slab of rock equal in size to the one placed above it. Below this second slab was another chamber similar to the one already spoken of, and in it were a large golden flower (supposed to be lotus), five flowers of gold, borne upon a main peduncle with five branching pedicels supporting the five flowers; with silver and gold images and relics. Another stone similar in size to the ones dug out formed the floor of the second chamber. At this stage it was getting late, and the work was stopped for the day. The excavations will be continued to-day. The Assistant Government Agent made an inventory of the treasures found in the dagoba, and gave them in charge of the Basn\u0101yika Nilame of the N\u0101tha Dew\u0101le, who had them removed to the Dew\u0101le, where they are now locked up. His Excellency the Governor was expected to be present when the jewels were taken out, but it seems he did not come up from Colombo. The excavations were continued on Saturday, but nothing of value was exhumed. The object of the excavation by the temple authorities is to find if the pattra datu (fragment of Buddha's begging bowl) was buried in this dagoba. In the Mahawansa it is stated that one of these fragments is buried in a very picturesque spot; tradition would make the spot to be in some of the dewales and vihares of Kandy. The relics found were removed to the M\u0101lig\u0101wa on Saturday, where they will be washed and placed in one of the chambers to be exhibited to the people. From the offerings made and subscriptions, these relics will again be buried in a more substantial dagoba.\u2014Ceylon Times, March 11.\n\nThe late M. Garrez.\u2014We are glad to notice, from a very interesting and appreciative notice of M. Garrez in the 'Revue Critique,' written by M. Barth, that it is intended to republish the various articles by the deceased scholar, whose loss we all so much deplore, in a volume of 'Remains.' Scattered as they now are through numerous periodicals, they are difficult to trace, and are too often overlooked. M. Senart has also published, in the 'Journal Asiatique,' an interesting account of M. Garrez's life and literary work.\nV. Reviews.\n\nDie Kafa-Sprache in Nordost Afrika, von Leo Reinisch. Wien, 1888, 2 Bde.\u2014The Kafa Language. I. Grammar; II. Vocabulary.\n\nThis work, which I have already noticed (J.R.A.S. Vol. XX. pp. 459-460), treats for the first time in a scientific way a Hamitic language, previously illustrated by Ludwig Krapf (1843), Charles T. Beke (1846), Ant. d\u2019Abbadie (1872), and, quite recently, by Antonio Cecehi (1887). But these travellers only published lists of words, making no attempt to fix the grammatical principles of that language, the \u201cAppunti grammaticali\u201d given by A. Cecchi (Da zeila alle frontiere del Caffa, III. 403-441) being quite inadequate for such a purpose. Prof. Leo Reinisch has succeeded in his usual way, compiling original texts, tales and colloquial phrases, from the mouth of the natives; endeavouring to get them translated correctly, and then, with much skill, deriving from them a Grammar and Vocabulary. In the present case, however, he has experienced much difficulty, from the fact that his informants had more or less forgotten their own language.\n\nThe Kafa language is closely akin to the Agaw idioms (notwithstanding the differences which have originated from the separate development of the two languages), and also with the Gonga, Masai and Kunama languages. It is spoken, not only in the Kafa country proper, but also in many districts bordering on it to the east, south and west. The whole family is called Sid\u00e1ma, and it may be said that the Kaf\u00e1dyo, or Kafa language, is but a branch of the Sid\u00e1ma group.\n\nThe nouns are, as a rule, biconsonantic, with vocalic ending, as h\u00e1fo (bird). If there are more than two consonants, we have to deal with compound or foreign words, or with reduplicative forms. The masculine is expressed by the final vowel -o, the feminine by -e, as: m\u00e1no (brother), m\u00e1ne (sister). As is often the case in East-African languages, the\nplural is formed by reduplication of the second radical consonant, as: k\u00e1fo (bird), kaf\u00edfo (birds): gender is expressed in the plural in the same way as in the singular. The genitive is usually put before the nominative, with or without the suffix -i or -\u00e9, as: Am\u00e1n g\u00e9to or Amani g\u00e9to (Aman\u2019s house); the other cases are expressed by means of postpositions.\n\nThe qualificative adjective may be placed before or after the noun, or even it may be separated from it; it agrees in gender with the noun; but, when it is used as an attributive, it always preserves the masculine form.\n\nThe personal pronouns are also possessive, as: ta (I, my), ne (thou, thy), \u00e1ro (he, his), \u00e1re (she, her).\n\nVerbs are distinguished from nouns only by means of the final vowel -e, as: m\u00e1to (meal) and m\u00e1te (to eat), ta m\u00e1to (my meal) and ta m\u00e1te (I eat). There is really but one tense, which is used for the past, the present and the future; sometimes an adverb emphasizes the notion of the past or of the future; but usually the speaker points out with his hand some object behind or before him in order to express the past or the future. Thus, ta m\u00e1te means really (I eat, I ate, I will eat). The imperative is the verbal stem, without any final vowel, as: m\u00e1t! (eat!); the subjunctive and the conditional are formed with the substantive verb ne.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the learned author has not been able in this, as in his former works, to give us texts.\u2014T. G. de G.\n\nDie Saho-Sprache, von Leo Reinisch. I. Texte. Wien, 1889.\u2014The Saho Language. I. Texts.\n\nThe Saho language has been till now quite unknown, if we except some scanty lists of words supplied by travellers and a grammatical Note already contributed by Prof. Leo Reinisch (Zeitschrift der morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft), which I have not before me. The new volume, therefore, just published by the indefatigable Professor deserves a hearty welcome from those interested in African linguistics. It consists only of texts and translations; but we are promised a Vocabulary\nbefore the present year elapses, and an extensive Grammar will complete the whole work.\n\nThese texts were collected by Prof. Leo Reinisch at Massowa, Argigo and Zula, in the years 1875\u20131876 and 1879\u20131880, from the mouth of an intelligent native, who spoke also Arabic, Amharic, Tigre and Tigray, and who had been previously employed in various political missions by the English expedition in Abyssinia and by Munzinger-Pasha. The texts, which cover no less than 310 pages, are classed under several heads, as follows: 1. Historical traditions of the Sahos; 2. Manners and customs; 3. Stories illustrating the customs and the laws; 4. Tales; 5. Fables; 6. Anecdotes; 7. Songs; 8. Proverbs; 9. Enigmas. From this list, it will be seen how interesting is the collection, which would certainly deserve to be translated into English for the use of general readers, were it not for the crudeness, not suitable for all readers, always found in native stories. The three following riddles are worth noting:\n\n\u201cWhat is that which looks like water but cannot be drunk?\u2014Answer: Sea.\u201d \u201cWhat is that which is in thine eye and also in mine?\u2014Answer: Sleep.\u201d \u201cWhat is the large skin which God has widened?\u2014Answer: Earth or Heaven.\u201d\n\nQuelques Contes Nubiens, par Max. de Rochemontiex. Le Caire, 1888 (Tirage \u00e0 part du IIe volume des M\u00e9moires de l\u2019Institut Egyptien).\u2014Nubian Tales, Texts and Translations.\n\nThese Tales were collected, in 1877, amongst the Nubian populations, which the Egyptian fellahs and the nomads of the Nile basin call rather contemptuously Berberines (French Barbarins; Arabie \u0628\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0631 barbari, pl. ber\u00e1bra). The learned compiler and translator is of opinion that the similitude of the word barbari (not the Latin word, I suppose) with the name of the town of Berber and that of the ancient Berberata of the Upper Nile is merely fortuitous. I cannot endorse this view, and I think that these names are largely connected with each other and with that of the modern Berbers, but not at all, of course, with the Greek and Latin words\n\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 and barbarus. I have in preparation a paper on this subject, which may possibly be read before the next Oriental Congress at Stockholm.\n\nThe scientific system of transliteration used by the author for the original texts is generally quite satisfactory, though some objections might be raised against certain peculiarities. Thus, for instance, the so-called palatals \\( k \\), \\( g \\) and \\( n \\) might have been expressed advantageously by the combinations \\( ky \\), \\( gy \\) (dy) and \\( ny \\), which would have much better represented the French sounds kie, guie, nie, than the abnormal signs used. Again, the author, while using extensively the semi-vowel \\( w \\) in the English way, has entirely discarded the semi-vowel \\( y \\), as in: eii, \"yes,\" instead of eyi (Reinischi eixo, \u00e9yo; cf. Pul \u00e9yo); haiir, \"to frighten,\" instead of hayir (R. h\u00e1yir; Ar. \u0647\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u064c); dunia, \"crowd,\" instead of dunya (Ar. \u062f\u064f\u0646\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0627), etc.\n\nThis new volume consists of twelve interesting tales with their translation into current French. The first seven tales are also provided with an interlinear translation, which will prove of great use to the students of the Nuba language. The words borrowed from the Arabic are carefully noted and given in Arabic characters at the foot of each page. The author gives us most accurate explanations of the origin, the connection and the interpretation of the original texts, and he promises some grammatical notes. The whole will form a useful complement to Prof. Leo Reinisch's great work (Die Nuba-Sprache, 2 vols. Wien, 1879); even in its present state, the work I am introducing to English scholars and students is a very valuable contribution to our scientific knowledge of African languages.\u2014T.

By Edward Granville Browne, M.A., M.R.A.S.\n\nMy object in the present essay on the B\u00e1b\u00eds is twofold. Firstly, I desire to bring to the notice of those who are interested in the history of thought generally, and Oriental thought in particular, the results of my investigations into the doctrines, history, and circumstances of a religious body which appears to me to constitute one of the most remarkable phenomena of the present century.\n\nSecondly, I wish to point out how much still remains to be done to thoroughly elucidate the matter, and to emphasize the fact that every year which passes will render it more and more difficult to fill in certain important details in the history and chronology of this sect. I sincerely hope that some, who have the means and opportunities of assisting in this task, may be induced to do so while it is still possible; for there are many men living who can remember the earliest events of the B\u00e1b\u00ed movement, and could some of these be persuaded to contribute accounts of those occurrences of which they have reliable knowledge, and their exact dates, it would doubtless be possible to compile from them a thoroughly accurate and trustworthy history. Believing as I do that B\u00e1biism is destined to leave a permanent mark in the world, I feel very strongly how desirable it is that this work should be accomplished; and to this end I shall put\nforward as accurate a chronological sketch of the chief events connected with this movement as I have been able to compile from the materials at my disposal.\n\nI shall also state of what new sources of information I have been able to avail myself, and point out the most important inconsistencies in the several accounts of the B\u00e1b\u00eds hitherto published in Europe and the East.\n\nMy desire is that the chronological arrangement which I suggest may meet with the fullest criticism, in order that it may be amended and corrected wherever it can be shown to be erroneous.\n\nIn the present paper I propose to deal mainly with the history of the B\u00e1b\u00eds, and my personal experiences amongst them in Persia between the autumns of the years 1887 and 1888, leaving an account of their literature and beliefs for another occasion.\n\nMy attention was first attracted to the subject by a perusal of the most admirable and clear-sighted work of M. le Comte de Gobineau (formerly attach\u00e9 at the French Legation in Teher\u00e1n), entitled \"Religions et Philosophies dans l'Asie Centrale,\" from whose graphic and vivid description of the first beginnings and early struggles of the B\u00e1b\u00eds I derived more pleasure than I can describe. Anxious to learn more on the subject, I sought for other accounts, which should inform me of the further progress of the sect, but to my disappointment I could find none; the history was in no case continued beyond the year 1852, which was marked by the attempted assassination of the Sh\u00e1h on the part of certain individuals belonging to the B\u00e1b\u00ed community, and the terrible persecution of the latter consequent thereon. All that I could learn was that the sect existed in secret, and was believed to be increasing in numbers. I therefore determined that should I ever have an opportunity of visiting Persia, I would make the investigation of this matter one of my chief objects.\n\nIn the year 1887 this much-wished-for opportunity presented itself. I was elected to a Fellowship at Pembroke College, Cambridge, and it was intimated to me that I should\ndo well to spend some time in travelling in Persia to acquire a fuller acquaintance with the language which was my favourite study. In the autumn of that year, therefore, I proceeded, by way of Constantinople and Trebizonde, and thence overland by Erzeroum, Kh\u00fay, and Tabr\u00edz, to Teher\u00e1n, where I arrived on November 22nd, visiting on my way the town of Zanj\u00e1n, so celebrated in the annals of the B\u00e1bis.\n\nAt first I met with nothing but disappointment in my attempts to penetrate the mystery in which the sect is shrouded, and I was advised by my Persian friends, whenever I alluded to the subject, to abstain from mentioning a name so distasteful to the government. After remaining two months and a half in Tcher\u00e1n, I had scarcely added to the information which I already possessed to any material extent, and though I had met with people evidently well disposed towards the B\u00e1bis, I had not found one who would avow to me that he belonged to them, or who would speak of them in any but the most guarded manner.\n\nDiscouraged at my ill-success in this matter, in February, 1888, I proceeded to Isfah\u00e1n, where at length my hopes were fulfilled, and I obtained the clue which enabled me, during the remaining seven months which I spent in Persia, to pursue my investigations in a manner which exceeded all that I had hoped.\n\nIt befell in this wise. One day two dall\u00e1ls, or vendors of curiosities, came to show me their wares. Having learnt to my cost that the inexperienced traveller is likely to be imposed upon by these people, I was not very anxious to buy anything, and while we were disputing about the price of some articles, one of the two men stepped up to me and whispered in my ear, \"I am not a Musulm\u00e1n that I should desire to cheat you; I am a B\u00e1bi.\"\n\nMy astonishment at this frank avowal was only equalled by my delight, and I replied to him, \"If you are indeed a B\u00e1bi, you may, perhaps, be able to assist me in obtaining some books which will tell me about your beliefs.\" Seeing that I was really anxious to learn about them, he not only promised to do this, but also offered to take me to his house\non the following Saturday, where I should meet the chief B\u00e1b\u00ed in Isfah\u00e1n, \"for,\" said he, \"he visits the houses of all of us who have believed in this *zuh\u00far* or 'manifestation,' at stated intervals, and next Saturday it will be our turn.\"\n\nIt is needless to state how gladly I accepted this offer, or how delighted I was when on the following day the dall\u00e1l, according to his promise, brought me two B\u00e1b\u00ed books, one of which was the *Ik\u00fan*, an important work in which an attempt is made to prove the truth of the new dispensation, or \"manifestation,\" to use the B\u00e1b\u00ed term. Of the contents of this I shall have to speak in my next paper, in dealing with the B\u00e1b\u00ed literature.\n\nOn the appointed Saturday I was instructed to be in waiting at a certain spot at a certain hour, and to follow one who would indicate by a sign that he was to be my guide to the rendezvous. Acting according to these directions, I was presently conducted to the house of the dall\u00e1l, and after partaking of some tea, and waiting a little while, a middle-aged man, of grave and prepossessing countenance, entered the room, and was received by my host with much respect. This, as I soon learned, was one of the chief B\u00e1bis, not only in Isfah\u00e1n, but in the whole of Persia; he does not reside for long in one place, but travels about from city to city, edifying believers, making converts where possible, and paying an occasional visit to Acre (*Akk\u00e1*) in Syria, which is the present headquarters of the B\u00e1bis, and the residence of their spiritual chief, Beh\u00e1.\n\nThis was the only occasion on which I saw this remarkable man, as I had arranged to leave Isfah\u00e1n a few days later for Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, where I was anxious to arrive before the Persian *Nawruz*; and during this one short interview I was naturally unable to learn much from him.\n\nOn hearing that he had been to Acre, I asked him what he saw there, to which he only replied, \"*Ins\u00e1n\u00ed-r\u00e1 didam dar kam\u00e1l-i-ins\u00e1niyy\u00e1t,*\" \"I saw a man in the perfection of humanity.\"\n\nHe promised, however, to write to some of the principal B\u00e1bis at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z to inform them of my desire to converse\nwith them, \"and,\" he added, \"these will give you the names of others in any of the towns which you may subsequently visit.\"\n\nIt was further arranged that I should on the following day visit the graves of the \"Martyrs of Isfah\u00e1n\" (two Seyyids who were put to death some eight or ten years ago for being B\u00e1b\u00eds), which is one of the places of pilgrimage of their co-religionists.\n\nNext day I was accordingly taken by the dall\u00e1l to the great cemetery called \"Takht-i-F\u00fal\u00edd,\" where we were met by a poor man connected in some capacity with the place, who also proved to be a B\u00e1b\u00ed. After he had read the ziy\u00e1rat-n\u00e1ma, or form of prayer appointed by Beh\u00e1 to be used by those visiting these graves, which is partly in Arabic and partly in Persian, he told me that he had become a B\u00e1b\u00ed by reason of a dream, wherein he saw hosts of pilgrims visiting this place.\n\nWe then sat down by the graves, which are marked only by a low mound of earth and bricks (the Muhammadans having destroyed the tombstones once placed there), and the dall\u00e1l proceeded to give me an account of the death of these two martyrs, known amongst the B\u00e1b\u00eds by the titles of \"Sult\u00e1nu'sh-Shuhad\u00e1\" (the King of Martyrs), and \"Malib\u00fa-bu'sh-Shuhad\u00e1\" (the Belov\u00e9d of Martyrs).\n\nAs this constitutes one of the most important events in the recent history of the sect, I may perhaps be permitted to give a somewhat full account of it, compiled from what I heard not only on this occasion, but also subsequently, in Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, Yezd, and Kirm\u00e1n.\n\nI will begin with the account given me by the chief B\u00e1b\u00ed, whom I met at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, the fellow-worker (and for some time the fellow-exile at Khart\u00fam, in the Soudan) of him whom I have just described as the chief of the sect at Isfah\u00e1n.\n\nHe told me that, shortly before the event we are discussing, he was at Acre, intending to start for Persia in a few days. Beh\u00e1 was in a garden where he sometimes goes, and my informant, with two others, was standing before him. Beh\u00e1 bade them to be seated, and gave them tea. Then he\nsaid to them, \"A great event will shortly take place in Persia.\" In the evening one of them asked him privately where it would be, and he replied, \"In the land of \u0160\u00e1d,\" which is what the B\u00e1bis call Isfah\u00e1n. The questioner wrote this information to his friends in Persia, and his letter is believed to exist still, but I have not seen it.\n\nOn the arrival of my informant at K\u00e1sh\u00e1n, on his way to Isfah\u00e1n, news came of the martyrdom of the two B\u00e1bi Seyyids, H\u00e1j\u00ed M\u00edrz\u00e1 Hasan and H\u00e1j\u00ed M\u00edrz\u00e1 Huseyn, and he at once recognized this to be the fulfilment of the prediction.\n\nTheir death had been brought about in this way. They were merchants of considerable wealth and great integrity, amongst whose debtors was a mull\u00e1 of Isfah\u00e1n called Sheyk\u0324h B\u00e1kir, who owed them the sum of 10,000 t\u00fam\u00e1ns (about \u00a33000). They began to press him for payment, and he, anxious to avoid this, went to the Im\u00e1m Jum'a of Isfah\u00e1n, and denounced them as B\u00e1bis, also laying great stress on their wealth. The two then went to the Zill-i-Sult\u00e1n, the Sh\u00e1h's eldest son, who was at that time governor of Isfah\u00e1n, and represented their case to him. He replied that he could not put them to death merely on account of their being B\u00e1bis, but that if they, as the representatives of Isl\u00e1m, gave a fatv\u00e1 for their execution, he would not hinder its being carried out.\n\nThe two mujtahids therefore collected seventeen other members of the 'ulam\u00e1, and signed the death-warrant of the two Seyyids, who were cast into prison. When this was known, efforts were made by some of the European residents in Isfah\u00e1n, by whom the prisoners were known and respected, to obtain their release, and telegrams were sent to his Majesty the Sh\u00e1h praying him to stop the execution of the sentence. The remand was sent, but arrived too late. The two Seyyids, having been offered their lives on condition of renouncing their creed, and having refused to do so, had their throats cut; their bodies were then dragged through the streets and bazaars of Isfah\u00e1n, and finally cast under an old mud wall outside the city, which was then overthrown on them.\n\nThat night, when all was quiet, an old and faithful servant\nof the murdered men came in secret and removed the bodies from under the ruins of the wall, which had so fallen as to cover without crushing them. He then reverently washed them, cleansing the blood from the gaping wounds, and placed them in two ready-made graves, which he filled in.\n\nIn the morning, the soldiers discovered that they had been moved, and tried to intimidate the old servant into revealing their last resting-place, but he refused to do this, asserting that he had buried them out in the Haz\u00e1r Der\u00e9.\n\nSoon after this a terrible letter came from Aere to Sheykh B\u00e1kir, threatening him with God's vengeance. Shortly afterwards he got into trouble, and was requested to retire to Kerbel\u00e1. On his return thence to Isfah\u00e1n he was overwhelmed with troubles, both domestic and pecuniary; his daughter disgraced him; his wife proved unfaithful to him; and he finally died miserably.\n\nThe Im\u00e1m Juma had, it is said, on witnessing some hesitation on the part of the executioner in slaying the victims, placed his hand on his neck and said, \"If there be any sin, let it be on my neck.\"\n\nAfter the execution he too fell into disgrace, and retired to Mash-had, where he was attacked with abscesses in the neck, and returned to Isfah\u00e1n only to die there; and thus were the martyrs avenged.\n\nThe stress which I have laid on the various predictions or prophecies of Beh\u00e1 in connection with these events, may be surprising to some. I may say that I have not been able to see any of the documents referred to, except the letter addressed to Sheykh B\u00e1kir, of which I failed to obtain a copy, and only had time to note one paragraph, which was specially pointed out to me as having been fulfilled by the downfall of the Zill-i-Sult\u00e1n last year. The translation of this is as follows: \"Verily we heard that the countries of Ir\u00e1n were adorned with the ornament of justice, but when we made investigation, we found them the rising-places of tyranny and the dawning-places of oppression. Verily we see justice under the claws of tyranny. We ask God that He will deliver it by a power from beside Him, and an\nauthority on His part. Verily He is the Guardian over whomsoever is upon the earth and in the heavens.\"\n\nSimilar prophecies are often quoted by the B\u00e1b\u00eds as a proof of their religion. Amongst many others I may mention, of the earlier ones, the prediction of the downfall and death of M\u00edrz\u00e1 Tak\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, the first Prime Minister of the present Sh\u00e1h, by whose advice the B\u00e1b was put to death at Tabr\u00edz in July, 1850; the former event taking place a little more than a year after the latter. This prediction is ascribed by Gobineau to some of the sufferers of Zanj\u00e1n. Again, Kurratu'l-'Ayn, the B\u00e1b\u00ed heroine and poetess, who was put to death in 1852, is said to have told Mahm\u00fad Kh\u00e1n, the Kal\u00e1ntar, in whose house she had been confined previously to her execution, that he would shortly be killed, which actually occurred, according to Kazem Beg, in 1861. This prediction is also mentioned by Gobineau, and I have heard from one who was himself acquainted with Mahm\u00fad Kh\u00e1n, and who had the story from him, that in like manner she foretold the circumstances of her own death the day before its occurrence.\n\nAmongst later predictions, namely those given by Beh\u00e1, I may mention, besides those already referred to, that of the downfall of Napoleon III., and the Franco-German war, said to have been foretold about 1863, which a B\u00e1b\u00ed at Yezd assured me that he had read four years before those events took place.\n\nBesides these, the downfall of Sult\u00e1n 'Abdu'l-'Aziz, the death of '\u00c1li P\u00e1sh\u00e1 away from his native country, and the assassination of the Turkish ministers who were killed by Cherkez Hasan, are all said to have been foreshadowed by Beh\u00e1, and many of those B\u00e1b\u00eds who have been much at Acre relate instances of verbal warnings of impending events and dangers in their own cases.\n\nAs instances of the latter, the following, which I heard from one of the two B\u00e1b\u00ed missionaries to whom the events occurred, may be taken as typical.\n\nThey were returning to Persia from Acre, by way of Diy\u00e1r Bekr, Mosul, and Raw\u00e1nd\u00edz, carrying with them some\nB\u00e1b\u00ed books and documents. Before starting they received instructions to the effect that, so soon as they crossed the Persian frontier, they were at once to hand these over to some trustworthy person to convey them to Tabr\u00edz, and on no account to keep them themselves. Without in the least understanding the object of this command, they nevertheless obeyed it literally, and on reaching So\u00fach Bul\u00e1k, and learning that a certain B\u00e1b\u00ed merchant was there, they sent a note to him telling him that they desired to see him on important business. He understood, and came out to them, and the three walked away together in silence till they had left the town. Then they sat down by a stream, and the missionaries, telling the merchant the orders they had received, handed over the books and papers to him. These he took, and promised, though with some trepidation, to convey them to Tabr\u00edz. Next day the two missionaries continued their journey, but they had not gone more than a farsakh on their road when they were attacked by Kurdish robbers, and stripped of everything that they had except their shirts and drawers. Had the books been with them, they too would have been lost.\n\nThe following is a narrative of another event which I have on the same authority as the last, my informant and his fellow-worker being, as before, the actors therein. It occurred about the year 1866, when Beh\u00e1 was at Adrianople, before he was sent to Acre, and they had been visiting him there for a while. On leaving, they were instructed to proceed to Cairo to visit and encourage the B\u00e1b\u00eds there, and avert a threatened schism. They took their passage in a steamer on which was a Persian merchant also belonging to the sect, but before starting they had been told on no account to speak with him on the voyage. As before, they obeyed, without understanding, their orders. They reached Cairo safely, and occupied themselves in instructing and encouraging their co-religionists, quieting dissensions amongst them, and conversing with such Persians and others as came to them to learn about their doctrines. The Persian Consul tried to prevent this, and failing to do so, he invited\nthe two missionaries to his house, saying that he wished to hear about their religion, of which he had been unable to obtain accurate accounts. They accordingly went, suspecting no danger, and until six hours after sunset talked with the Consul on religious matters. Suddenly the Consul commanded his servants to seize them, and confine them in a room in his house. He then sent other servants to search the domicile of his guests, and these returned bringing with them five or six B\u00e1b\u00ed books which they had found there. Next day he laid the matter before Isma'il P\u00e1sh\u00e1, informing him that these two men were confessedly B\u00e1b\u00eds, dangerous alike to Isl\u00e1m and the state; that he had consequently arrested them by stratagem, and also obtained their books, amongst which was their Kur'\u00e1n, by which they asserted the Muhammadan Kur'\u00e1n was abrogated; and that by these their heresy was sufficiently proved.\n\nIsma'il P\u00e1sh\u00e1 had the books in question laid before the Mejlis-i-Istint\u00e1k, or Council of Enquiry, by whom their owners were pronounced to be heretics, and condemned to exile for life to Khart\u00fam, in the Soudan, whither they were sent without further trial or chance of defending themselves, together with six or seven other B\u00e1b\u00eds. The merchant who had been their fellow-traveller from Adrianople, and whom they had been forbidden to speak to on the journey, was also accused, and only escaped exile because it was proved that during the voyage he had held no communication with the others. They then understood the reason of the prohibition which they had received from Beh\u00e1.\n\nAt Khart\u00fam they remained for about seven years, and were for some time unable to communicate with Beh\u00e1, concerning whom, indeed, vague rumours reached them that he had been removed from Adrianople to some other place, which they finally learnt from some Protestant missionaries with whom they made friends, was Acre. By means of these they were further enabled to send a letter there, and in answer to this a letter was written by Beh\u00e1, consoling them in their exile, and telling them that they would shortly be released and rejoin him at Acre, and that their oppressor,\nIsma'il P\u00e1sh\u00e1, would soon fall from power. This letter was brought to Khart\u00fam by an Arab named J\u00e1sim, who took six months to reach it. At that time the exiles saw no hope of release, but, shortly after, General Gordon arrived, and finding these Persians imprisoned there enquired what their crime was. They replied that they did not know, as they had never been tried or given an opportunity of meeting their accusers. On hearing this, General Gordon telegraphed to Isma'il P\u00e1sh\u00e1, demanding the reason of their imprisonment and exile, and, receiving no satisfactory reply, ordered the B\u00e1bis to be released, and gave them permission to go wherever they pleased. My informant and his companion returned to Acre, and once more, as foretold, stood in the presence of Beh\u00e1. The other exiles preferred to remain at Khart\u00fam, where they married and settled.\n\nThe narrator of these events I met at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, whither I proceeded on leaving Isfah\u00e1n, and where I remained for about three weeks. There, thanks to the letter which had been written about me from Isfah\u00e1n, and another fortunate chance, I saw a great deal of the B\u00e1bis; and, sometimes in their houses, sometimes in the beautiful gardens which surround the city, and which alone render it worthy of all the praises bestowed upon it by H\u00e1fiz and a host of other poets, I used to sit with them for hours, hearing their books read, listening to their anecdotes or arguments, and discussing their doctrines.\n\nBy the kindness of these friends I obtained two manuscripts of the utmost value for further investigation. One of these was the \"La'uh-i-Akdas,\" or \"Most Holy Tablet,\" which may be described as the Kur'\u00e1n of the B\u00e1bis.\u00b9 It is quite a small volume, written in Arabic, and summing up the doctrine in its essentials, with regulations concerning prayer, the fast, the division of the year, marriage, inheritance, the punishment of crime, and other matters. I hope to give a more detailed account of its contents on a future occasion.\n\n\u00b9 More mature consideration has made me regret having used this term, owing to its ambiguity, and the number of B\u00e1bi works to which it has been applied, as will be pointed out in my second paper.\nThe other book was a voluminous manuscript of the earlier history of the sect in Persian. The author implies that he was not a Persian, but a Frenchman who was travelling in Persia, and who, having witnessed the persecutions inflicted on the B\u00e1b\u00eds, and their fortitude, was desirous to learn more about them. Having succeeded in meeting and conversing with many influential and learned votaries of the new religion, he wrote this history to embody the results of his investigations. None of the B\u00e1b\u00eds, however, believe that the author was anything but a Persian, and some of them informed me who he was, for he is no longer alive. The history only extends down to the events of the year 1850, viz. the martyrdom of the B\u00e1b at Tabr\u00edz, and the \u201cseven martyrs\u201d at Teher\u00e1n. The important events of 1852 are not included in it. The author continually refers to a second volume, which he intended to write if he lived, but unfortunately he did not accomplish his purpose.\n\nThis history has many defects in style and arrangement, and there are very few dates given, while some of those that are given are utterly wrong, as can be clearly proved. It contains 374 pages, at least half of which are irrelevant to the subject, consisting of tirades against the mull\u00e1s and the like. Nevertheless it gives a mass of most interesting details of the lives, conversions, adventures, discussions, and characters of many of the principal actors in the earlier events of the B\u00e1b\u00ed movement, including the B\u00e1b himself, so that, in spite of its manifold defects from a literary point of view, it is of the greatest value as well as of the utmost interest.\n\nAt Sh\u00edr\u00e1z I saw some of the relations of the B\u00e1b, who are called by the B\u00e1b\u00eds \u201cAf\u00e1n\u00e1n,\u201d just as the sons of Beh\u00e1, the present chief of the sect, are called \u201cAgh\u00e1s\u00e1n,\u201d both these words meaning \u201cbranches.\u201d I likewise met, on one occasion, the B\u00e1b\u00ed courier, a taciturn old man, who enjoys the title of Sheyk. I subsequently learned some particulars concerning him which I think are of sufficient interest to be recorded. He visits the south of Persia (Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, Isfah\u00e1n, and Yezd) once a year, going from town to town collecting the letters which are to be forwarded to Acre, and distributing\nthose sent from thence, which are called by the B\u00e1b\u00eds \"Alic\u00e1h\" (tablets), and are regarded in the light of revelations. The north of Persia is similarly visited by another courier. The Sheykh, having accomplished this distribution and collection of letters, times his journey so as to reach Bushire some few weeks before the beginning of the month of Zil-Ijij\u00e9, and goes thence with the pilgrims to Jedda and Mecca. From thence he proceeds to Acre, after the rites of the Hajj are accomplished, and remains there about two months; after which he returns by land to Mosul, where lives an important personage amongst the B\u00e1b\u00eds, whose business it is to revise carefully all copies of the sacred books, to see that they are accurate before they are sent out for distribution. There the Sheykh remains for about a month, after the lapse of which he returns by way of Baghdad and Bushire to Persia. In his land journeys he always goes on foot, carrying his packets of letters on his back in a sort of wallet, after the manner of Persian K\u00e1sids. For food, a few onions and a piece of bread suffice him. He walks generally out of the beaten track, to avoid meeting people who might recognize him. At night he sleeps in graveyards or other places outside towns and villages, unless it be at a place where there are B\u00e1b\u00eds, when he sometimes stays with them. His fear of being recognized is not imaginary. On one occasion he was recognized by some one in a village near Yezd. News was given to the K\u00e9dkhud\u00e1, or chief man of the village, who, being busy, ordered him to be seized and confined till he had leisure to attend to the matter. The Sheykh accordingly found himself locked up to await the arrival of his inquisitors. The only thing which troubled him was that his wallet was filled with letters from the B\u00e1b\u00eds to their chief at Acre. If these were discovered the writers would be known, and might get into trouble. There was no fire, and it was impossible to bury them, so he proceeded to chew them up and swallow them. This was no light task, as they were very numerous, and amongst them was one particular letter from the south-east of Persia which gave him much trouble. Finally, however, he accomplished\nhis task before the arrival of the Kedkhud\u00e1 and his attendants, and though these proceeded first to question and then to beat him, in order to make him confess, he stubbornly declined to make any declaration, so that they were eventually compelled to release him. On another occasion, the ship in which he was going from Bushire to Basra was wrecked, and all on board were lost except himself and a dervish, who escaped by clinging to some planks, and were picked up after fourteen or fifteen hours.\n\nAt Sh\u00edr\u00e1z also I first saw specimens of the new writing of the B\u00e1b\u00eds. It must not be supposed that this is at all generally used, either in their books, or letters; for it is only known to a very few. I regret to say that I did not secure any specimens of it, neither did I learn to read or write it. It is written from left to right, and the letters are separated from one another. Each one consists essentially of an oblique straight line running downwards to the left, like the downward strokes in copy-books. To this are appended various thin curved lines and hooks which particularize the letter. This writing is intended for a time when B\u00e1bi\u00edsm shall become the state religion of some country. It is called by the B\u00e1b\u00eds \"Khatt-i-Bad\u00ed',\" and there are several varieties of it.\n\nThere are also seals with a particular device cut in cornelian which are used by some members of the sect. This device consists of a vertical straight line with a hook at either end turned to the left, which is crossed by three horizontal lines, also with curves at both ends. The upper and lower of these latter have also at each end an affix resembling the soft h (h\u00e1-yi-hawwaz, or h\u00e1-yi-d\u00fa-chashmi).\n\nI may here mention one or two other customs of the B\u00e1b\u00eds, though I only discovered some of them at a later date.\n\nFirstly, their salutation. In mixed society they of course use the ordinary Muhammadan \"es-sel\u00e1mu 'aleykum\" (peace be upon you), to which the answer is, \"va 'aleykumu 's-sel\u00e1m\" (and upon you be peace). But amongst themselves, when they are sure that no strangers are present, their salutation is \"All\u00e1hu abh\u00e1\" (God is most bright), and the answer is the same. In the Bey\u00e1n, which is the book of M\u00edrz\u00e1 'Al\u00ed\nMuhammad the B\u00e1b, the salutation was different in the cases of men and women. The former were commanded to say \"All\u00e1hu Akbar\" (God is most great), the answer being \"All\u00e1hu a'zam\" (God is most mighty). The latter were to say \"All\u00e1hu ajmal\" (God is most beautiful), the answer of which was \"All\u00e1hu abh\u00e1\" (God is most bright). The last of these is, as I have said, the only one used now, probably out of respect to the present head of the religion, for Beh\u00e1 and Abh\u00e1 come from the same root.\n\nSecondly, their fast is not in Ramaz\u00e1n, but during the nineteen days preceding the Nawruz, or Persian New Year's day, which is the first day of the first of the nineteen months, of nineteen days each, of which their year consists. Five intercalary days, corresponding to the five days called G\u00e1t\u00e1 by the Zoroastrians, are placed before the month of fasting, and are directed to be spent in hospitality and charity. It is not at present rigidly insisted on that the B\u00e1b\u00eds should observe this fast, because to do so would at once show them to be B\u00e1b\u00eds, which is inexpedient. The same applies to other distinctive ordinances. Circumcision is, for example, stated by Gobineau to have been abolished by the B\u00e1b, though on this point I can find no clear command either in the Bey\u00e1n or the La\u00fah-i-Akdas; and while some of the B\u00e1b\u00eds say that it is indifferent, and others deny that it has been abolished, as a matter of fact it is still continued. In like manner it was no doubt intended by the B\u00e1b that the use of the veil by women should be discontinued, but of course this cannot at present be done in Persia, at any rate openly. The B\u00e1b also desired to abolish divorce, and, as far as possible, polygamy, as well as to allow fuller freedom to women, and grant them admittance into society; but at present these reforms have only met with partial success, though I have on rare occasions met B\u00e1b\u00ed women in general assemblies.\n\nIn Turkey I am informed that the B\u00e1b\u00eds may be recognized by their appearance. They wear the Turkish fez, surrounded by a small white turban, and the jubb\u00e9 as a garment; they neither shave their heads nor allow their hair to grow below the level of their ears, discarding the\nzulf generally worn by Persians. In Persia, however, these distinctions are not observed.\n\nI have often heard it said by those who were not B\u00e1b\u00eds, that members of this sect are able to recognize each other by some sign. After careful inquiry I have come to the conclusion that this, like many other statements made about them, is only true to a very partial extent.\n\nSome of them say that they can recognize one another by \"affection\" (mahabbat), or by the \"light in their faces,\" but the greater number agree that mutual recognition is only possible by conversation. Of this latter fact there is no doubt; not only have they a different manner of looking at things to the Muhammadans, but likewise they often employ words and phrases which are not used, or less frequently used, by the latter. One of these is the word \"zuh\u00far\" (manifestation), which with them bears somewhat the sense of the word \"dispensation\" in the mouths of our theologians. Thus they speak of the B\u00e1b\u00ed movement as \"in zuh\u00far\" (this manifestation), and similarly they call former revelations \"zuh\u00far\u00e1t-i-kabl.\"\n\nThe word \"mazhar,\" which means \"place of appearance, or manifestation,\" is much used by them. Thus they will say, speaking of Kurratu'l-'Ayn, whom they call Jen\u00e1b-i-T\u00e1hir\u00e9 (Her Excellency the Pure), \"Mazhar-i-Jen\u00e1b-i-F\u00e1tima-ast\" (She is the place-of-manifestation of Her Excellency F\u00e1tima), while they will say of one of their persecutors, \"Mazhar-i-Shimr\u00e1st,\" or \"Mazhar-i-Yaz\u00eddast\" (He is the place-of-manifestation of Shimr or Yaz\u00edd).\n\nIt is perhaps easier for a Christian to recognize a B\u00e1b\u00ed when he meets him than for a Muhammadan; partly because the B\u00e1b\u00eds are less afraid of disclosing their tenets in such a case; partly because they are, as a rule, friendly to the Christians, whom they do not, like the strict Muhammadans, regard as impure (\"najis\"); partly because they frequently have a very considerable knowledge of the Gospels, which they will quote, and from which they will try to prove that their religion is true, and that the promised coming of Christ was fulfilled in the B\u00e1b or Beh\u00e1.\nAt Taft, through which I passed on my way from Sh\u00edr\u00e1z to Yezd, I recognized a B\u00e1b\u00ed in this way. He first asked me whether I were a Christian, and, on my replying in the affirmative, he questioned me concerning the signs of Christ\u2019s coming. Then he remarked, \u201cPerhaps He has come,\u201d and presently asked me, \u201cHas the news of this zuh\u00far reached you?\u201d\n\nAt Yezd, as at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, I remained three weeks, and there too saw much of the B\u00e1b\u00eds. I had been informed that B\u00e1b\u00edsm was spreading amongst the Zoroastrians, which seemed very surprising, considering how long they had adhered to their ancient creed in the face of much persecution, oppression, and contempt. However, after much intercourse with the Zoroastrians of Yezd and Kirm\u00e1n for the space of three months and a half or more, I came to the conclusion that, though not a few of them were very well disposed towards the B\u00e1b\u00eds (probably in great measure because the latter are not only much more tolerant of other religions than the Muhammadans, but likewise recognize Zoroaster as a prophet), few if any had actually adopted the B\u00e1b\u00ed creed.\n\nYezd bears the official title of \u201cD\u00e1ru\u2019l-\u2018ib\u00e1dat,\u201d or \u201cAbode of worship,\u201d and it deserves this name; for the Muhammadans, Zoroastrians, and B\u00e1b\u00eds of that ancient city are all characterized by a greater degree of zeal and strictness in their religious beliefs and practices than I have witnessed elsewhere. The B\u00e1b\u00eds of Teher\u00e1n, some of whom I saw on my return thither on my homeward journey, are also very notable for their learning and piety.\n\nThe Muhammadans often accuse the B\u00e1b\u00eds (of whose doctrines they are usually quite ignorant) of immorality, communism, and wine-drinking; and several European writers have repeated these accusations. Now with regard to wine, strict B\u00e1b\u00eds do not drink it, though the prohibition thereof, at least till lately, appears to be less absolute than in Isl\u00e1m. I do not deny that I have seen B\u00e1b\u00eds drink it, and in some cases even take too much of it, but it is well known that in Persia the Muhammadans are very\nlax about this matter; certainly at least as much so as the B\u00e1b\u00eds.\n\nWith regard to communism, it appears from the statements of some writers that this has been imagined to be one of the essential features of B\u00e1b\u00edsm, as though the latter were a political rather than a religious movement. This might also be inferred from some of the statements of the Persian historians and others. Thus Mr. Stack, in his admirable and instructive book entitled \"Six Months in Persia,\" quotes the following remark made to him by a Persian gentleman: \"We, too, have our Nihilists, and they are called B\u00e1b\u00eds by us.\" So also the author of the Persian history called *N\u00e1sikhu't-Tav\u00e1rikh* represents their doctrines as resembling those of Mazdak, which are usually believed to have been communistic. Now the only sense in which the B\u00e1b\u00eds can be said to be communistic is in the same sense as the early Christians might be so described; namely, in a readiness to share their possessions with one another, and a generous liberality in helping each other, such as is often witnessed in young and struggling faiths. Concerning this, an Armenian gentleman at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z said to me: \"I like the B\u00e1b\u00eds because of their freedom from prejudice, and open-handedness; they will give you anything you ask them for without expecting it back, though on the other hand they will ask you for anything they want, and not return it unless you demand it.\" Their liberality in helping one another is so well known that I have observed instances of certain ignoble persons trading on it, and pretending to be B\u00e1b\u00eds, so as to avail themselves of the open-handedness of rich members of the B\u00e1b\u00ed community.\n\nWith regard to the accusations of immorality brought against them, which, as the writer of the article \"B\u00e1b\u00ed\" in the new Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica observes, \"seem to be founded solely on the misconduct of particular members of the sect,\" they doubtless arose partly from the false assertions of the author of the *N\u00e1sikhu't-Tav\u00e1rikh* and others that, according to the B\u00e1b\u00ed religion, a woman was allowed to have nine husbands and the like; partly from the tendency com-\nmonly observed in history to traduce and malign new religions, the tenets of which are imperfectly understood owing to the secrecy necessarily observed concerning them. It will be remembered that precisely similar accusations were made against the early Christians, probably for similar reasons. Of course I do not mean to imply that individual members of the sect may not be guilty of immoral actions, for amongst those who profess any religion some persons may always be found whose conduct is at variance with the essential principles of morality. What I do confidently assert is that those who, professing to be B\u00e1b\u00eds, are guilty of immorality, are contravening the precepts of their religion.\n\nI will not dwell at greater length on my experiences amongst the B\u00e1b\u00eds in Persia, of which I hope to give a fuller account at a future date, except to comment on a statement or conjecture of M\u00edrz\u00e1 Kazem Beg\u2019s in his lengthy and valuable article on B\u00e1b and the B\u00e1b\u00eds in the Journal Asiatique for 1866 (sixi\u00e8me s\u00e9rie, tome viii. p. 393). He says, \u201cThus lived the B\u00e1b, for a long while inoffensive, while the community of B\u00e1b\u00eds was secretly organized, being recruited by dreamers, mystics, superstitious people, who were by habit in expectation of the immediate advent of the im\u00e1m, revolutionaries dissatisfied with the government and the clergy, as well as evilly-disposed persons who, under the pretext of B\u00e1bi\u00edsm, hoped to serve their own interests. Thus there were formed amongst the B\u00e1b\u00eds three categories: the blind adorers of B\u00e1b, who belonged to the low class of the people, political agitators who had become his disciples, and evilly-disposed sectaries.\u201d\n\nNow, although I do not altogether agree with this statement, I am nevertheless convinced that B\u00e1bi\u00edsm attracts several very different types of thinkers.\n\nFirstly, those who, having been rigorous and pious Muhamadans, are convinced by the arguments adduced by the B\u00e1b\u00eds from the Kur\u2019\u00e1n and Traditions, that in the appearance of this religion are fulfilled the promises given, or believed to have been given, concerning the advent of the twelfth Im\u00e1m, or Im\u00e1m Mahd\u00ed.\nSecondly, those who desire the reform and progress of their country, and behold in B\u00e1bi\u00edsm capacities for this which they do not see in Muhammadanism.\n\nThirdly, S\u00faf\u00eds and mystics, who regard B\u00e1bi\u00edsm as a systematized and organized S\u00faffism, essential in its doctrines with their own pantheistic beliefs; and who consider its fundamental teaching to be the divine spark latent in man, by the cultivation of which he can attain to the degree of \"Fen\u00e1 fi'll\u00e1h,\" or \"Annihilation in God,\" wherein he may cry out, like Mans\u00far-i-\u1e24all\u00e1j, \"Ana'l-\u1e24akk,\" \"I am the Truth,\" or \"I am God.\"\n\nLastly, there are a certain number of people who are attracted by sheer admiration and love for the B\u00e1b, or his successor Beh\u00e1. These stand more or less isolated from the B\u00e1bi\u00ed community; they are satisfied with dwelling in their minds on the perfections of their hero, and celebrating his praises in poems. As a specimen of this class I will relate briefly the story told me by a young B\u00e1bi at Kirm\u00e1n of his conversion to B\u00e1bi\u00edsm. \"Some time ago,\" he said, \"I fell deeply in love; so that whenever I beheld the object of my affections, my whole body used to tremble; and when unable to gaze on my belov\u00e9d, I used to console myself by reading the ghazals of Sheyk\u0332h Sa'd\u00ed. One day a friend of mine requested me to give him my copy of the latter. I replied, 'I have no other book, and what can I do without it?' He answered, 'I will give you instead of it a better book,' and placed in my hands the Ma\u1e63nav\u00ed of Mawl\u00e1na Jal\u00e1l\u00fa'd-D\u00edn R\u00fam\u00ed. I thereupon began to read this, but at first understood nothing. 'Listen to the flute when it makes lament,' what did that mean, and what had it to do with me or my belov\u00e9d? I was sorry I had consented to receive this in exchange for my Sa'd\u00ed, but having nothing else, I continued to read it, until at length my soul became filled with the love of the Eternal Belov\u00e9d, and I saw that one should concentrate one's affections on that, and not on the transitory beauty of an earthly form, however lovely. One day, as I was walking outside the city, I came upon a man who was reading aloud, and the sweetness of the words caused me to\nstop and listen, and after a while I accosted him, and asked him what book it was. After some hesitation he informed me that it was the Bey\u00e1n of M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad of Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, commonly known as the B\u00e1b. I was desirous to hear more, and finally succeeded in obtaining a copy of the Bey\u00e1n for myself. It is thus,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthat my soul became filled with the love of His Highness, the Point of Utterance (Hazrat-i-Nukta-i-Bey\u00e1n), so that when I sing poetry it is no longer addressed to an earthly beloved, but is uttered in His praise.\u201d\n\nThis young man declined to ally himself altogether with either the Beh\u00e1\u2019\u00eds or the Ezel\u00eds, the two unequal parties into which the B\u00e1b\u00eds of today are divided. The former of these recognize Beh\u00e1 not only as the B\u00e1b\u2019s successor, but as \u201cHe whom God shall manifest\u201d (Man yuz-hiruhu \u2019ll\u00e1h) himself, of whose coming the B\u00e1b continually spoke, and of whom he declared that to read one verse of His was better than to know the whole Bey\u00e1n. The latter recognize M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1 (called by them \u201cHazrat-i-Ezel,\u201d \u201cHis Highness the Eternal\u201d) as the Vicegerent of the B\u00e1b, and consider that \u201cHe whom God shall manifest\u201d has not yet appeared. They are by far the least numerous of the two parties, and indeed are hardly to be found except in Kirm\u00e1n and one or two other places, whereas the Beh\u00e1\u2019\u00eds are diffused throughout the whole of Persia, and are to be found in large numbers in Turkey, Syria, Egypt, and perhaps other countries as well.\n\nWhen asked by the Beh\u00e1\u2019\u00eds to recognize Beh\u00e1 as the one foretold by the B\u00e1b, he would only reply, \u201cHis Highness the Point of Utterance is sufficient for me;\u201d yet he did not categorically deny the claims of Beh\u00e1 like the Ezel\u00eds.\n\nI will now conclude this part of my Essay with a brief summary of the chief events in the history of the B\u00e1b\u00eds, as I promised to do in the beginning of my paper, with the view especially of fixing the dates as far as possible; adding such remarks and criticisms as appear to me necessary. The literature and doctrines of the sect I hope to discuss on a future occasion.\n\nFirst I will enumerate the sources of information, already\nplaced before the public, of which I have been able to avail myself;\u00b9 then those to which I have had access, and which, as far as I am aware, have not hitherto been accessible, but which will, I hope, soon be rendered so.\n\nOf the former, the principal ones are: M. le Comte de Gobineau\u2019s \u201cReligions et Philosophies dans l\u2019Asie Centrale,\u201d and M\u00edrz\u00e1 Kazem Beg\u2019s articles in the Journal Asiatique for 1866, already referred to; the two Persian histories entitled respectively N\u00e1sikh\u00fc\u2019t-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh, and Rauz\u00e1tu\u2019\u015f-\u015eaf\u00e1 (or rather Mirz\u00e1 R\u00edz\u00e1 K\u00fali Kh\u00e1n\u2019s continuation of the latter); and incidental notices in other works of travel and history, amongst which I will only mention Mr. R. G. Watson\u2019s \u201cHistory of Persia under the K\u00e1j\u00e1r Dynasty,\u201d and Lady Sheil\u2019s \u201cDiary in Persia,\u201d both of which are of great use in examining critically the chronology of some of the chief events connected with the B\u00e1b\u00ed movement. Besides these I believe that treatises exist by Dr. Eth\u00e9, and M. Pillon, of which, I regret to say, I have hitherto been unable to avail myself. Of all these I consider the work of M. le Comte de Gobineau the best, and I cannot avoid paying a tribute of respect and admiration to the author of this most brilliant treatise on Persian thought.\n\nThe new sources of information which I have been able to avail myself of are, besides oral tradition, firstly, the manuscript history of the B\u00e1b\u00eds, of which I have already spoken; secondly, a manuscript copy of the Persian Bey\u00e1n which I obtained with great difficulty in the district of Rafsinj\u00e1n in South-eastern Persia; and thirdly the short poetical summary of the chief events in the life of Beh\u00e1 written by Nab\u00edl, one of the chief B\u00e1b\u00ed poets of the present day, who resides at Acre. Of these, the second clearly fixes some doubtful points\n\n\u00b9 Since writing the above, several other works bearing on the subject have come under my notice. To some of these I shall allude more fully in my next article on the B\u00e1b\u00eds. Briefly, they are as follows: Descriptions of B\u00e1b\u00ed MSS. in the St. Petersburg Library by Dorn (Bulletin de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Imp\u00e9riale de St. P\u00e9tersbourg, 1864\u201365), and Baron V. Rosen (Collections de l\u2019Institut Oriental); Description of three B\u00e1b\u00ed (Ezel\u00ed) MSS., by C. Huart, in the Journal Asiatique for 1887; an article on B\u00e1b\u00edsm, in the Arabic Encyclopaedia, called Dd\u2019iratul-Ma\u2019\u00e1rif, published at Beyrouth by Butrus-el-Bust\u00e1n\u00ed, which is based chiefly on information supplied by Jem\u00e1l\u00fa\u2019d-D\u00edn el-Afgh\u00e1n; and a few pages on \u201cB\u00e1b and his teaching,\u201d in A. von Kremer\u2019s Herrschenden Ideen des Islams.\nof great importance, and affords a certain amount of information about the B\u00e1b, who is believed by every one, I think, except M\u00edrz\u00e1 Kazem Beg, to be its author; while the third is of the greatest use in determining the chief points in the history of the sect subsequently to the death of the B\u00e1b (1850), and before the year 1286 A.H. (1869 A.D.).\n\nI have said that the most startling discrepancies exist even in the few authorities at our disposal. In no point is this more evident than in the age which they assign to the B\u00e1b, and the year in which they approximately place his birth. It seems desirable to begin with a date about which there is comparative unanimity of opinion; I mean the date of the zuh\u00far, or period when M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad became assured of his divine mission. By the Persian historians this is placed in the year 1260 A.H., corresponding to the year 1844 of our era. Gobineau says \u201cabout the year 1843,\u201d and Kazem Beg places the second visit of the B\u00e1b to Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, his native town, when his doctrines first began to be preached, in 1844. Now this date is fixed with great accuracy in the Bey\u00e1n, than which we can surely have no better authority, even though we were to assume, with Kazem Beg, that it was the work, not of the B\u00e1b himself, but of his intimate disciple, and continual companion, \u00c1k\u00e1 Seyyid Huseyn of Yezd, which there seems no reason for supposing. It is mentioned as follows in the seventh chapter of the second V\u00e1hid (Unity) of the Bey\u00e1n: \u201cavval-i-\u00e1n (zuh\u00far) ba\u2019d az d\u016b s\u00e1\u2019at \u00fa p\u00e1nzdah dakika az shab-i-Jum\u2018a, panchum-i-Jam\u00e1di-ul-U\u2019l\u00e1, sen\u00e9-i-haz\u00e1r \u00fa divist \u00fa shast, ki sen\u00e9-i-haz\u00e1r \u00fa divist \u00fa haft\u00e1d-i-bi\u2019sat mi-sharad.\u201d \u201cThe beginning of that (manifestation) (was) after two hours and fifteen minutes (had elapsed) from the eve of Friday, the fifth of Jam\u00e1di-ul-U\u2019l\u00e1 (in) the year one thousand two hundred and sixty, which is the year one thousand two hundred and seventy of the mission\u201d (of Muhammad). It will be seen from this that the B\u00e1b gives the hijra date of his mission as well as the date which he usually prefers, namely, that of the commencement of the preceding zuh\u00far, or mission of Muhammad. In one other passage in the Bey\u00e1n (V\u00e1hid vi. chapter 13), he repeats the\ndate of the month explicitly, namely, Jam\u00e1d\u00ed-ul-\u016cl\u00e1 5th, but describes the year after his favourite method thus: \"va ba'd az ghars-i-shajar\u00e9-i-Kur'\u00e1n kem\u00e1l-i-\u00e1n dar haz\u00e1r \u00fa dirist \u00fa haf-tad s\u00e1l ras\u00edd.\" \"And after the planting of the Tree of the Kur'\u00e1n, the perfection thereof arrived in one thousand two hundred and seventy years.\" Now this date (Jam\u00e1d\u00ed-ul-\u016cl\u00e1 5th, A.H. 1260), corresponds to May 23rd, A.D. 1844, and we may regard it as a fixed point from which to work.\n\nNow with regard to the age of the B\u00e1b at this time, different authorities vary by at least fourteen years. Lady Sheil, writing in 1850, says: \"This celebrated person was born forty years ago in Sh\u00edr\u00e1z.\" This, the earliest date given, would place his birth in the year 1810. Kazem Beg, basing his calculations on certain passages in the N\u00e1sikhu't-Taw\u00e1rikh, which describe the B\u00e1b as being about forty years old, fixes the year 1812. Gobineau, on the other hand, begins his narrative thus: \"About the year 1843 there existed at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z a young man, not more than nineteen years old if so much, named M\u00edrz\u00e1 'Al\u00ed Muhammad.\" This would make 1824 the year of his birth.\n\nAll these various statements are apparently referable to two sources: the assertious of the Muhammadan historians, especially the author of the N\u00e1sikhu't-Taw\u00e1rikh, and the tradition of the B\u00e1b\u00eds; Lady Sheil and Kazem Beg have followed the former, Gobineau the latter. Now it seems, prim\u00e2 facie, much more likely that the B\u00e1b\u00eds, who were deeply interested in the matter, should be right, than the Muhammadans, who probably cared very little about it, and on this ground alone I should prefer the date given by Gobineau. For the B\u00e1b\u00eds are unanimous in speaking of M\u00edrz\u00e1 'Al\u00ed Muhammad, the B\u00e1b, as having been nineteen years old when he commenced preaching his doctrine. I confess that the number nineteen, being the sacred number of the B\u00e1b\u00eds, looks a little suspicious, but at least the difference between this and his actual age cannot have been more than two or three years, for had he really been nearly forty years of age, such a tradition could never have gained currency amongst his followers within so comparatively\nshort a time of his death. Moreover they lay great stress on his youth: I have heard them speak of him as \"bacha-i-n\u00fazdah s\u00e1la,\" \"a child of nineteen years old;\" and in the B\u00e1b\u00ed history it is stated that the B\u00e1b's teacher, H\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid K\u00e1zim of Resht, during the latter days of his life, used to speak chiefly of the approaching advent of the K\u00e1'\u00edm, or Absent Im\u00e1m; and when asked for the signs whereby he might be known, indicated three: firstly, that he would be a H\u0101shim\u00ed (by which the B\u00e1b\u00eds understood a Seyyid); secondly, that he would be youthful in years; and thirdly, that he would be untaught in the learning of men; and all these signs they consider to have been present in the B\u00e1b. Now the author of this history says in one passage that thirty years have passed wherein the B\u00e1b\u00eds have been visited with all sorts of severities, and, writing so soon after the events he chronicled, and which he had from eye-witnesses, it appears perfectly incredible that he should go out of his way to state that H\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid K\u00e1zim mentioned youthfulness as one of the signs of the expected K\u00e1'\u00edm, if the B\u00e1b, whom he wishes to prove is the K\u00e1'\u00edm or Im\u00e1m Mahd\u00ed, were not actually young.\n\nBut apart from these arguments, two passages in the Bey\u00e1n throw light on the matter. The first occurs in the first chapter of the second v\u00e1lhid and the translation thereof runs thus: \"One from whose life twenty-four years had passed, and who was entirely devoid of all the sciences which others had studied, and now recites verses in this manner without thought or reflection, and writes in the space of five hours a thousand verses in prayer without pause of the pen, this thing is assuredly from God.\"\n\nThe other passage occurs much further on, in the eleventh chapter of the sixth v\u00e1lhid, and runs as follows: \"As, in the manifestation of the Furk\u00e1n (i.e. the Kur'\u00e1n), no one recognized that Sun of Truth until forty years had passed (over him), and in (the case of) the Nukta-i-Bey\u00e1n (\"Point of Utterance,\" i.e. the B\u00e1b) (until) twenty-five years.\"\n\nNow it will be observed that in the first of these passages the B\u00e1b speaks of himself as being twenty-four years old,\nand in the second as twenty-five. What are we to understand by this difference if not this: that when the first passage was penned the writer was twenty-four years of age, and that the second was written a year later? The Bey\u00e1n is a large book (I mean, of course, the Persian Boy\u00e1n, not either of the two Arabic Bey\u00e1ns, the shorter of which was translated into French by Gobineau, and the longer of which I have not yet been able to see), and it may well be supposed that a year elapsed between the utterance of the two passages above quoted. The only other suppositions are\u2014either that one of the statements is a copyist's error (which seems scarcely likely, when we consider that the scribe must almost certainly have been a B\u00e1b\u00ed, and would therefore hardly commit so gross an error in the transcription of what he regarded as a sacred book); or else, which is even more improbable, that the mistake was the B\u00e1b's, and that he did not even know his own age!\n\nI will therefore assume that the first passage indicates truly the age of the B\u00e1b at the time it was written. The question now arises, when was it written? I think it is possible to fix this date also within certain limits. I have references to fourteen passages, mostly in the earlier part of the book, stating explicitly or implicitly that the latter was written during his exile in M\u00e1ku, near Tabr\u00edz. Now we know that the B\u00e1b did not leave Isfah\u00e1n, whither he went after his first imprisonment at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, till the death of Min\u00fa-chihr Kh\u00e1n, Mu'tamadu'd-Dawla, which took place, according to Kazem Beg, in the year 1847, and according to M\u00edrz\u00e1 R\u00edz\u00e1 Kul\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, author of the supplement of the Raq\u1e63atu-s-Suf\u00e1', in the month of Rab\u00ed\u2018ul-U\u2019l\u00e1, which would fix the date as being either the latter half of February or the first part of March, 1847.\n\nNow supposing the B\u00e1b to have left Isfah\u00e1n immediately after this, and to have been conveyed direct to M\u00e1ku by way of Teher\u00e1n, within a short distance of which he was brought before his escort received orders to convey him to Tabr\u00edz and M\u00e1ku, he can scarcely have reached the latter place before the middle or end of April, 1847. Now he remained at\nM\u00e1k\u00fa for three years, according to the B\u00e1b\u00ed historian, that is, till his martyrdom in July, 1850, except for six months out of that time, during which he was confined at Chihr\u00edk, near Urumiyy\u00e9. As it is implied in the very same chapter from which the first reference to his age is drawn, that this was written at M\u00e1k\u00fa, it seems unlikely that its date should be earlier than the end of 1847 or the beginning of 1848. If, then, his age at that date were twenty-four years, he must have been born at any rate not earlier than A.D. 1824, which agrees with Gobineau's statement, and the B\u00e1b\u00ed tradition, that he was only nineteen years old at the period of the Zuh\u00far. Putting all these things together, I think we may fix the birth of the B\u00e1b at about the year 1824 of our era.\n\nThe next point which I wish to discuss is the date of the B\u00e1b's martyrdom at Tabr\u00edz, in connection with which I shall have to speak of the dates of the great B\u00e1b\u00ed insurrections at Sheykhl Tabars\u00ed, near B\u00e1lfur\u00fash, in M\u00e1zandar\u00e1n, and at Zanj\u00e1n in the Khamsa.\n\nWith regard to the M\u00e1zandar\u00e1n insurrection, all authorities are agreed that it began shortly after the death of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h (September 4th or 5th, 1848), and was finally quelled in July or August, 1849. But in the case of the two other events, there is some difference.\n\nWatson, Piggott, and Kazem Beg all place the commencement of the siege of Zanj\u00e1n in the month of May, but whereas the two former make the year 1850, the latter asserts it to have been 1849. According to the first two authorities, an interval of about nine months must have elapsed between the fall of Sheykhl Tabars\u00ed and the commencement of the troubles at Zanj\u00e1n; while the latter states explicitly that the news of the former event reached the B\u00e1b\u00eds, who were defending themselves at Zanj\u00e1n, during the latter part of 1849, and served to discourage them.\n\nLady Sheil records the siege of Zanj\u00e1n, and the ultimate fate thereof, in her Diary of the events of 1850, and after speaking of the execution of seven B\u00e1b\u00eds (\"The seven martyrs,\" Shuhad\u00e1-i-sab\u2018a) at Teher\u00e1n, proceeds, \"In Zanj\u00e1n . . . . the insurrection broke out with violence.\" The\nbalance of evidence is therefore in favour of May, 1850, as the date of the commencement of the siege. Watson says that it lasted \"all through the summer of 1850,\" and that \"the scene of operations was visited in the month of October by Sir Henry Bethune.\" This statement, however, introduces a further difficulty, for Kazem Beg makes the siege last from May till the following January, whereas according to Watson's account, it can only have lasted from May till October; unless, indeed, we are to understand that Sir Henry Bethune visited the scene of operations before the conclusion of the siege, and that Lady Sheil, in chronicling the events of the year 1850, mentioned the conclusion of it, which did not actually occur till the beginning of 1851.\n\nOn the whole, I am inclined to believe that Kazem Beg was in error, as he certainly is in placing the B\u00e1b's death in 1849. The latter error appears to result from the former, for there seems no reason to doubt that the B\u00e1b was shot at Tabr\u00edz during the siege of Zanj\u00e1n (as is explicitly stated by Watson), and in the month of July. Kazem Beg himself quotes a statement of M. Mochenin's (from whose notes he draws much of his information), to the effect that the latter had himself seen the B\u00e1b at Chihr\u00edk, in June, 1850, but he says in a note at the bottom of the page, \"M. Mochenin must be deceived about the date; in 1850 B\u00e1b no longer existed. He was put to death towards the middle of July, 1849.\" It is difficult to see what facts made Kazem Beg reject so clear a testimony to the fact that the B\u00e1b was still living in June, 1850, unless it be, as I have suggested, that his error concerning the date of the siege of Zanj\u00e1n threw him into this further mistake, and that he followed the N\u00e1sikhu't-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh, which makes the year A.H. 1265 (which ended on November 16th, 1849) the date of this event. The B\u00e1b\u00ed history, on the other hand, fully supports the statements of Watson and Lady Sheil in favour of the year 1850, for it says: \"The holy spirit of that noble one (i.e. the B\u00e1b), flying from that delicate frame, ascended to the highest horizon; and this event occurred on Thursday the 27th of the month of Sha'b\u00e1n, in the year one thousand two hundred and sixty-six\nof the hijra, which was the seventh year of the manifesta-\ntion\u201d (zuh\u00far). If this be correct, as there is every reason to\nbelieve (since the B\u00e1bis would surely be more interested than\nany one else in preserving the exact date of the death of their\nfounder), we obtain July 9th, 1850, as the day on which the\nB\u00e1b suffered martyrdom. Gobineau likewise gives Sha'b\u00e1n\n27th as the date, but does not, I think, mention the year.\n\nWe have now fixed five important dates, from which it is\npossible approximately to arrange the remaining events of\nthis period in chronological order. These I shall give in a\ntabular form at the conclusion of this part of my paper, but\nbefore doing so, the history of the B\u00e1bis from the date of the\nB\u00e1b\u2019s death down to the year 1869, when Nab\u00edl\u2019s poetical\nchronicle was written, must be sketched in outline.\n\nOn the death of the B\u00e1b, M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahya, who received the\ntitle of \u201cHazrat-i-Ezel\u201d (\u201cHis Highness the Eternal\u201d), was\nchosen by general consensus of opinion as his successor, and\nappears to have left Persia and taken up his residence in\nBaghd\u00e1d almost immediately. He laid no claims to pro-\nphetic rank, being merely the \u201cKhal\u00edfa,\u201d or vicegerent of\nthe B\u00e1b.\n\nIn January, 1852, M\u00edrz\u00e1 Tak\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, the Sh\u00e1h\u2019s first\nprime-minister, at whose suggestion the B\u00e1b was put to\ndeath, and who had fallen into disgrace with the Sh\u00e1h and\nbeen dismissed from office a few months previously, was\nsecretly put to death at the palace of F\u00edn, near K\u00e1sh\u00e1n.\n\nIn August of the same year (Aug. 15th, 1852), the attempt\non the life of the Sh\u00e1h by certain B\u00e1bis was made, and a\nfierce persecution of the sect immediately succeeded it; in\nwhich, amongst other victims, the beautiful and accomplished\nB\u00e1b\u00ed heroine and poetess, Kurratu\u2019l-\u2018Ayn, as well as the B\u00e1b\u2019s\nformer amanuensis and fellow-prisoner, A\u2019k\u00e1 Seyyid Huseyn\nof Yezd, and Suleym\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, whose extraordinary fortitude\nunder the most terrible tortures has rendered his name famous,\nsuffered death. Beh\u00e1, who had failed in an attempt to\njoin the B\u00e1bis in M\u00e1zandar\u00e1n during the siege of Sheyk\nTabars\u00ed, narrowly escaped death on this occasion, and appears\nactually to have been arrested; but as he had just returned to\nTeher\u00e1n, his friends succeeded in proving that he could not have had any complicity in the attempted assassination of the Sh\u00e1h, and, after a short period of imprisonment, he also went to Baghdad, where M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1 already was. This occurred, according to Nab\u00edl, in A.H. 1270 (Oct. 4th, 1853\u2013Sept. 24th, 1854).\n\nHere he remained, with occasional periods of retirement into solitude, for 10 years (till A.H. 1280), and during this period (in A.H. 1278) he wrote the *I'k\u00e1n*, or proof of the truth of the B\u00e1b\u00ed doctrines, of which I have already said something. About the same time the B\u00e1b\u00eds at Sult\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d in \u2018Ir\u00e1\u1e33-i-\u2018Ajam\u00ed suffered a severe persecution, of which I have heard a very detailed account from one who but narrowly escaped the death which befell four of his fellow-prisoners. Besides these, a B\u00e1b\u00ed woman was sent thence to Teher\u00e1n, and there strangled by order of the Sh\u00e1h.\n\nThe Persian Government viewed with disfavour the presence of the B\u00e1b\u00eds at Baghdad, and finally, in A.H. 1280 (A.D. 1863\u20134), prevailed on the Turkish Government to remove them to a spot more remote from Persia.\n\nThey were first taken to Constantinople, where they remained for about four months; thence, in Rajab, A.H. 1281 (December, A.D. 1864), they were sent to Adrianople, called by the followers of Beh\u00e1, \u201cArz-i-sirr,\u201d \u201cThe Land of the Mystery,\u201d because it was there that Beh\u00e1 announced his divine mission, and claimed to be \u201cHe whom God shall manifest\u201d (A.H. 1283 = A.D. 1866\u20137). On his making this announcement, the B\u00e1b\u00eds were divided into two parties, some admitting Beh\u00e1\u2019s claim, and others, at the head of whom was M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1, who had hitherto been regarded by all as the B\u00e1b\u2019s successor and vicegerent, denying it. These latter argued that \u201cHe whom God shall manifest\u201d could not come until the religion founded by the B\u00e1b had obtained currency, and the laws laid down in the Bey\u00e1n had been adopted, at least by some of the nations of the earth. They asserted that it was an impossible thing that one revelation should so soon be abrogated by another, and that so brief a period should separate\ntwo \"zuh\u016brs,\" or manifestations; while they further adduced texts from the Bey\u00e1n to prove that more than a thousand years, and probably either 2001 or 1511 years (represented respectively by the sum of the letters in the words Gh\u012by\u0101\u1e63 and Musta\u011f\u1e25\u0101s according to the abjad notation) must elapse between the time of the B\u00e1b and the advent of \"Him whom God shall manifest.\"\n\nAgainst these arguments the followers of Beh\u00e1 quoted numerous texts from the Bey\u00e1n to the effect that the day and place of His coming were known to God alone (Persian Bey\u00e1n, iv. 5, vi. 3, vii. 10); that He will arise suddenly (vii. 9), and is to be known by Himself, not by the Bey\u00e1n (vii. 11), for he is the fulfilment of the verse \"Leysa Ke-mithlihi shey\" (There is none like unto Him) (v. 16); and that it was impossible that any one should falsely claim to be Him (vi. 8). They urged, moreover, that all through the Bey\u00e1n the utmost stress was laid upon \"verses\" (\u00e1y\u00e1t) being the essential sign and proof of a prophet, and that the Lawh-i-Na\u1e63ir, in which Beh\u00e1 announced his prophetic mission, and other writings of his, fulfilled the conditions which constituted \"verses,\" viz. Eloquence of diction; rapidity of utterance; knowledge unacquired by study ('Ilm-i-ladunni); claim to divine origin; and power to affect and control the minds of men.\n\nThe discussion between the two parties grew fierce, and finally they came to blows in some cases, and several on either side were killed. The Turkish Government decided to separate them, and it was determined to send M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1 and his followers to Cyprus, and Beh\u00e1 with his adherents to Acre on the Syrian coast. The latter place was used by the Turks as a prison and place of exile for convicts, and is said to be extremely unhealthy, especially during the summer months. The B\u00e1b\u00eds declare that it was chosen on that account, in the hope that it might prove fatal to Beh\u00e1 and his followers, and that this scheme was devised by the French and Persian ambassadors at Constantinople in conjunction with '\u00c1l\u00ed P\u00e1sh\u00e1, who said, \"I will send him to a place where he will soon die.\" It was on this account that\nthe letters sent by Beh\u00e1 to Napoleon III., foretelling his downfall, and to \u2018Al\u00ed P\u00e1sh\u00e1, prophesying his death in a foreign country, were written; and in another letter, addressed to the Emperor of Russia, thanks are bestowed for kindness shown by the Russian minister. Of these documents, which, with some others addressed to other potentates, are collectively known as the \"S\u00fara-i-Heykal,\" I shall speak more particularly in treating of the Literature of the B\u00e1bis.\n\nIt was further decided that a few of the Ezel\u00eds, or followers of M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ya\u1e25y\u00e1, should be sent with Beh\u00e1 and his adherents to Acre; and that some of the latter should be transported with the majority of the Ezel\u00eds to Cyprus. The reason of this arrangement was a hope that in each case the dissentient minority would strive to hinder Persians and others from coming to visit either of the B\u00e1b\u00ed chiefs, by giving information of their arrival and intention to the Turkish Government. Much difficulty was experienced in carrying out this arrangement, the Beh\u00e1\u2019\u00eds refusing to be separated from their chief. One of them cut his throat, and refused to allow the wound to be dressed and the hemorrhage checked, until he received a promise that he should be allowed to accompany his master to Acre. Others cast themselves out of the ships which were to separate them from him into the sea.\n\nEventually only three or four of the followers of Beh\u00e1 were conveyed to Cyprus. One of these was the celebrated \"Mushkin-Kalam,\" who is famous among the B\u00e1bis for his penmanship, and who keeps, or used to keep, a coffee-house at, I think, Larnaka-Skala. Whenever a Persian landed there, he used to invite him in, and offer him tea or coffee and a kaly\u00e1n; and if, in the course of conversation, he succeeded in eliciting from his visitor that he had come thither to see M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ya\u1e25y\u00e1, he tried to prevent him doing so, either by persuasion, or by warning the Turkish officials of his intention. Since Cyprus has become a British possession, I do not know how the matter stands, and though I have made some inquiries, I have hitherto been unable to learn whether\nM\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1 is still alive or not.\\footnote{In the article on B\u00e1biism in the Arabic Encyclop\u00e6dia called *D\u0101'iratu'l-Ma'\u0101rif*, to which I have alluded in a previous note, it is stated that the Turkish Government \"exiled *Subh-i-Ezel* ('the Morning of Eternity,' i.e. M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1) to the island of Cyprus, where he died; and exiled Beh\u00e1 to Acre, where he still lives with a number of his followers.\" Within the last few weeks, rumours have reached me from Beyrouth to the effect that Beh\u00e1 is dead, and that one of his followers named Seyyid 'Ali, Sh\u00edr\u00e1z\u00ed, has been chosen to fill his place. For the truth of this report, however, I cannot vouch.} It is probable that if he be so, he will be at Lefkosia, and it is extremely desirable to find this out, for much precious information concerning the B\u00e1b could undoubtedly be gathered from him. His followers soon dwindled to a very small number, and I was informed by a B\u00e1b\u00ed who had visited him a few years ago, that he was living alone in great poverty, and, I think, deserted by his own sons. He is said to spend his days in lamenting over the death of the B\u00e1b, and writing poems in his praise.\n\nWith regard to the seven Ezel\u00eds sent to Acre, they were massacred one night by some of the followers of Beh\u00e1, but without the knowledge of the latter, so far as we can judge. The names of five of these unfortunate victims were: *A'k\u00e1 J\u00e1n*, nicknamed \"Kaj-Kul\u00e1h\" (crooked-cap), a young man of great strength, who had served in the Turkish artillery, till dismissed and imprisoned for being a B\u00e1b\u00ed, and who was first killed, as he came to open the door on hearing the knocks of the assassins; H\u00e1ji Seyyid Muhammad, of Isfah\u00e1n, one of the companions and disciples of the B\u00e1b himself; M\u00edrz\u00e1 R\u00edz\u00e1, nephew of the above; H\u00e1ji Seyyid Huseyn, of K\u00e1sh\u00e1n; and M\u00edrz\u00e1 Haydar 'Ali, of Ard\u00edst\u00e1n, described as a man of wonderful fire and enthusiasm.\n\nThe Turkish officials, on hearing of this massacre, confined all the followers of Beh\u00e1 in the caravansaray, till the twelve murderers gave themselves up, saying, \"We killed these men on our own responsibility and without the knowledge of the others. Punish us, not them.\" They were thereupon imprisoned for some time, but eventually released on Beh\u00e1's son, 'Abb\u00e1s Efendi (called *A'k\u00e1 Sirru'll\u00e1h*, \"The Mystery of God\"), making himself surety for them. They were not permitted to leave Acre, and were for some time compelled to wear gyves upon their ankles.\nThis event occurred about a month after the arrival of Beh\u00e1 and his followers at Acre, i.e. about October or November, 1868. From that time till the present day, the followers of Beh\u00e1 have been increasing in number and influence, and the followers of M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1 decreasing, so that among the many B\u00e1b\u00eds with whom I formed acquaintance in Persia, I only met six Ezel\u00eds. These, of course, do not accept any of the writings of Beh\u00e1 as inspired, and their sacred books are confined to the Bey\u00e1n, and other writings of the B\u00e1b. M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1 is also the author of some books, I believe, but these are only regarded, even by the Ezel\u00eds, as of secondary importance, while the Beh\u00e1\u2019\u00eds reject them entirely.\n\nThus at the present day nearly all the B\u00e1b\u00eds are Beh\u00e1\u2019\u00eds, and the Bey\u00e1n, and other writings of the B\u00e1b, are in their eyes already an abrogated revelation;\u2014a sort of Old Testament, read occasionally for edification, but no longer authoritative as a guide of life and belief. It is this fact which makes copies of the Bey\u00e1n so difficult to obtain, since they have become scarce; and moreover the B\u00e1b\u00eds prefer to place in the hands of the inquirer the writings of Beh\u00e1.\n\nThe latter are very numerous, since all the letters sent by him to his followers or others are regarded as inspired writings in the fullest sense of the word. Beh\u00e1 is now 74 years of age, and still dwells at Acre, where he is visited by numbers of his followers, as well as by inquirers. According to what I have heard, the respect paid to him by the former is unbounded. They regard him as an incarnation of the Deity, and indeed commonly speak of him as \u201cH\u00e1kk\u201d (God, or the Truth), although, as I hope to explain more fully on a future occasion, they understand his divinity in different ways. He has several sons, one, already alluded to, named \u2018Abb\u00e1s Efendi, and called by the B\u00e1b\u00eds \u201cGhusn-i-A\u2018zam,\u201d or \u201c\u00c1k\u00e1 Sirru\u2019ll\u00e1h,\u201d who travels about to Beyrouth and other places in Syria; another, named Mirz\u00e1 Muhammad \u2018Ali, and entitled \u201cGhusn-i-Akbar.\u201d Beh\u00e1 himself is named Mirz\u00e1 Huseyn \u2018Ali, and is of noble family. He was born in A.H. 1233, on Muharram 2nd, in Teher\u00e1n. He never appears in public, and never leaves Acre except to visit a garden which he\npossesses in its vicinity, and this he does at night. He is constantly waited on by one known amongst the B\u00e1b\u00eds as Jen\u00e1b-i-Kh\u00e1dimu\u2019ll\u00e1h (His Excellence the Servant of God), who admits those who desire an audience in parties of from half a dozen to a dozen, at stated times. A scribe is also present who writes so swiftly that he can take down verbatim all the utterances of Beh\u00e1, which are subsequently copied out for distribution.\n\nThese audiences of which I have spoken do not appear to last long as a rule. One of them was described to me minutely by a B\u00e1b\u00ed with whom I was intimately acquainted, and who visited both Acre and Cyprus in the course of his travels. At the former place he remained seventy days, and during this time was \u201chonoured\u201d (\u201cmusharraf\u201d), that is, admitted to an audience with the Beh\u00e1, twelve times. The first occasion was three days after his arrival. He was accompanied by a friend who had been there before, and by the afore-mentioned Kh\u00e1dimu\u2019ll\u00e1h. On reaching the flight of stairs leading to the room where Beh\u00e1 was with his two sons, my informant saw his companions prostrate themselves, and enter the room on their knees. While he was hesitating as to whether he should do the same, Beh\u00e1 called out to him \u201cL\u00e1zim nist,\u201d \u201cIt is not necessary.\u201d Beh\u00e1 then placed his hands on their heads, and greeted them twice with the words \u201cB\u00e1raka\u2019ll\u00e1hu \u2018aleykum\u201d (\u201cGod hath blessed you,\u201d or \u201cMay God bless you\u201d). Then he said, \u201cMost blessed are ye, in that ye have been honoured with beholding me, for prophets have desired this most ardently.\u201d He then told them to sit down, and tea was placed before them. My informant\u2019s companion hesitated to drink it before receiving permission, seeing which, Beh\u00e1 said to him, \u201cThe meaning of placing tea before a person is that he should drink it.\u201d Kh\u00e1dimu\u2019ll\u00e1h then read a \u201cLa\u00fah\u201d to them, and they were dismissed. My informant added, that being taken ill a little while after, he was sent some pil\u00e1w from Beh\u00e1\u2019s own plate, and that on eating this he was cured. Many of the B\u00e1b\u00eds strove to carry off a few grains of rice for themselves. On another occasion when he was admitted to an audience, Beh\u00e1 said to him, \u201cI desire that all men may become even as I am.\u201d\nSince the arrival of Beh\u00e1 at Acre, the most important events in the history of the sect are the despatch of the Letters to the various sovereigns of some of the chief countries in Europe and Asia, inviting them to embrace the new religion, and the martyrdom of Bad\u00ed', the youthful messenger who carried the letter addressed to the Sh\u00e1h of Persia to Teher\u00e1n, which probably occurred about A.D. 1869; and the death of the \"Martyrs of Isfah\u00e1n,\" described above, about A.D. 1880 or 1881.\n\nThe letters were as follows:\u00b9 to the Sh\u00e1h of Persia, the bearer of which went on foot from Acre to Teher\u00e1n, where he suffered a painful death, being branded to death with hot bricks; to Sult\u00e1n 'Abdu'l-'Aziz; to Napoleon III.; to the then reigning Emperor of Russia; to the Pope; to the President of the United States; and to our own Queen Victoria. In the latter much commendation is bestowed on the Queen and the English Government.\n\nI must here conclude this imperfect account of the history of this interesting and curious religion, which, although far from being as accurate and precise as I should have wished, contains, I believe, matter hitherto not brought before the public. I hope soon to be in possession of fuller materials, and to be able to publish a better account of the subject. Meanwhile I shall be very greatly obliged to any one who will correct any of the dates given, or supply me with any fuller information. The Literature and Doctrines of the sect I propose to consider in another Paper. My hope is that this attempt to give some further account of a most important religious movement in the East, which may not improbably again play a prominent part in history, may at least serve to attract the attention of Orientalists and others to a hitherto much neglected subject, which, alike from the claim to be a Universal Religion put forward by B\u00e1bi'ism, and from the tragic events which befell its founder and many of his followers, surely deserves the fullest investigation.\n\n\u00b9 Of the second and sixth of these I do not possess a copy, and of the existence of the latter I am doubtful.

VII.\u2014The Land of the Four Rivers. A Supplement forming Part III. of the Series of Notes on the Early History of Northern India. By J. F. Hewitt, M.R.A.S., late Commissioner of Chota Nagpur. With a Map.\n\nIn two previous papers written in the Journal of this Society\u00b9 I have adduced reasons for believing that the earliest Indian civilization was originated by the Dravidian immigrant races who formed stable governments in the countries previously ruled under the more loosely organized system of the Kolarian tribes, and who founded and maintained a flourishing internal and foreign trade. In my latest paper I brought forward arguments, based chiefly on the early religious history of India, to prove that there were at least two Dravidian immigrations into Northern India before the Aryans entered the country, or at least before the arrival of that section of the Aryan race who founded the Brahmanical religion. The first Dravidian immigrants were the Accadian moon and snake worshippers, called in India Haihayas, or Sombunsi, the sons of the moon or Lunar Rajputs, and the second were the Semite-Aeead trading and warrior tribes, called Sukas Sans, sons of Ikshvaku, or Solar Rajputs. These latter immigrants worshipped the snake as their predecessors had done, but regarded the snake sun-god Vasuki, or Vishnu, as their parent and as the true symbol of the creative energy of nature, instead of the moon, which had occupied a similar position in the theology of their Accadian predecessors.\n\nI now propose to examine these conclusions still further than I was able to do in my previous papers, and to compare the Indian evidence with that furnished by the records of Accadian history and those of other nations who derived their astronomy and rules for reckoning time, as well as a large part of their theology, from Assyria. If we look into the early history of Assyria, Egypt and Palestine, we find in all\n\n\u00b9 Art. VIII. in J.R.A.S. 1888, and Art. III. in J.R.A.S. 1889.\nthese countries distinct evidence of a lunar year preceding the later solar-lunar year, and we also find strong reasons for believing that the people of these countries worshipped, under the symbol of the snake, the creative energy which gave life to the heavens and the earth. It was also, according to their belief, the moon who was the ruler of this vital creative power, and who regulated the lapse of time, caused the seasons in their courses to replace the dying produce of the past year by the reproduction of new life, to form and ripen the seed which was to bring forth fresh living generations, and to cause that seed to fulfil its functions by giving birth to the offspring it was destined to bear.\n\nTaking the Assyrian evidence first, we find that their gods were apparently worshipped under two aspects, first as creators,\\(^1\\) and secondly as the measurers of time. The gods as creators were the fathers of the old totemistic creeds; but instead of being many in number, and the fathers of numerous isolated tribes, they were looked at as the fathers of the united tribes which formed the nation of their worshippers. The gods as measurers of time were of much later origin, and could only have arisen after the people, by a long course of observations handed down through a long series of observers, had established the connection between the changes of the heavenly bodies and the regular sequence of the times and seasons. The existence of this organized system of inquiry is a certain proof that the people who adopted it had reached a stage of civilization far above that of the highest among the races considered as savages. It was as measurers of time that the gods appear in the Indian astronomy, the Nakshatras, who determined the changes of the moon, being reckoned as forming the most numerous section of the thirty-three gods who ruled the year. I have already shown that in the Hindoo lunar year, which was thought to be controlled by the moon in its successive phases, and the five planets, these thirty-three gods were divided into three groups of eleven each, each group having the special control of one\n\n\\(^1\\) Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, pp. 142-3, 179, 187.\nof the three seasons. The Nakshatras were certainly derived from Assyria, and the elevenfold division seems also to have come from thence; for in a hymn giving the account of the contest of Bel with the monster Tiamut the dragon, who represented the old Accadian snake-gods, her elevenfold offspring is spoken of.\\(^1\\)\n\nIt is perhaps the division of the year into three seasons which gave rise to the triads which form such a distinguishing feature in Accadian mythology;\\(^2\\) but whether this be the case or not, these triads, though they express the ideas of the early worshippers in a metaphysical, and, consequently, in a later form, afford valuable evidence as to the original premisses from which the conclusions they represent were deduced.\n\nBut before going fully into the question as to the fundamental tenets of the theology set forth in these triads, it is desirable to consider the value of the evidence to be derived from a study of the early religions of the Assyrians, Hindoos and Egyptians. I hope to be able to show, in the course of this paper, that these three nations derived their religious system solely, or in part, from Assyria. But it is not from Assyria that we get the most conclusive evidence as to the doctrines believed in by the races who worshipped the moon and the snake. In the Assyrian and Egyptian records we find the old religion of these people to a great extent obscured by the later theology of the writers of the solar-lunar period, who recorded the historical evidence which has come down to us. In these writings we find that the gods of the earlier system were either placed in a subordinate position to that of the gods of the newer belief, or were transformed into demons or guardians of the world of the dead.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See hymn translated by Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 382.\n\n\\(^2\\) This is apparently doubtful. Though Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 372, proves that there were only three seasons known to the ancient Greeks and Germans, and though this can also be proved with regard to the Latin races, yet, ancient as this division is, the sanctity attached to the number three is probably derived from a still earlier source. It was apparently coincident with the division of the year into thirteen months, ten being, as shown in pp. 544 and 553, months of gestation, and three being those of reproduction; these being the creative months were especially sacred.\n\n\\(^3\\) The dead were the fathers (Pitris) of the new believers who had died in the belief of the ancient and, to the sun-worshippers, obsolete creed.\nEgypt and Assyria, the areas ruled by the successive governments of the country were those of the valleys of the Nile and of the Tigris and Euphrates, with the land between these two latter rivers. These countries were therefore throughout their whole extent easily accessible to official and priestly influence, and the ruling powers had little difficulty in altering the religion of the governing bodies subject to their control, for public worship in these countries in ancient times was a purely official function. In India the case was different. The large extent of country colonized by the moon-worshippers, who had extended their settlements throughout the length and breadth of this vast continent, rendered it impossible for the Semite-Accad kings and leaders to extend their efforts for the propagation of their faith throughout the numerous kingdoms ruled by the people who had brought with them the earlier Accadian creeds. Such changes could not be made without conquest, for the Brahmin organization had not then been thought of, and conquest was difficult and unprofitable except for trading purposes. They consequently appear to have done little except to establish themselves in the countries adjoining the western ports, and do not appear, at the time the Vedas were written, to have advanced beyond the Jumna and the western division of the Chedi or Bundelkund country. We consequently find in the country east of that river the Accadian theology, which had been so greatly modified in its native home by the Semite-Accads, still subsisting side by side with the later Assyrian creed of the S\u0101ka-\u015aauv\u012bra of P\u0101\u1e6d\u0101la. There appears to be the strongest possible probability that the beliefs and ritual of the Indian moon and snake worshippers were identically the same as they had brought with them from the Euphrates valley; for during the period which elapsed between the arrival and settlement of the first Accadian immigrants and that of their Semite-Accad successors, no agency seems to have arisen by which any change in their religious belief could have been made. All the evidence tends to show that religious changes in the early times originated from foreign and not from native sources. For though the early Jain and Buddhist\ntraditions speak of a series of successive religious teachers, the early Buddhas, as well as the T\u012brthankaras of the Jains, seem to have been rather maintainers of the original traditions and revivers of religious zeal than preachers of new doctrines. Their doctrines when new were apparently rather developments of old teachings than fresh departures, as the very conservative character of the Dravidian races would have prevented them from assimilating doctrines which would have obscured the original foundations of their religion. The ancient theology, as a religion founded on reason, rested on the doctrines enshrined in the old lunar year, which they must have brought with them when they entered India. This lunar year was superseded in the West by the solar-lunar year of the Semite-Accads of P\u0101\u1e6d\u0101la, who must have become a power in India, if not in the time of Sargon, at least as early as that of Khammurag\u0101s (B.C. 2290\\(^1\\)); but while the new year they brought with them was accepted in the West, it never penetrated to the East, as is shown by the lunar year being mentioned in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and the Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a. As for the changes in the calendar, they must have been preceded by a long series of astronomical observations; and these could only have been carried on in Assyria, which was the only ancient country in which astronomical science was cultivated. In Assyria, as Dr. Sayce shows, astronomy had been studied from a most remote epoch. The Accadian name of the Semite-Accad month Tasrit\u0101, in which the autumnal equinox occurred, means the \"Month of the Illustrious Mound,\"\\(^2\\) and the mound here referred to is that which marked the ruins of the astronomical tower of Borsippa, which was built in seven stages, to represent the seven planets, long before Babylon, which was close to Borsippa, was founded. This old ruin, when built, represented the religion of the sun-worshippers; for the moon-worshippers held only the moon and the planets to be the rulers of heaven and earth. It was probably built to celebrate the\n\n\\(^1\\) Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 23.\n\\(^2\\) Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, pp. 115, 406.\ninauguration of sun-worship and the astronomical studies which preceded the adoption of the solar-lunar year. The formation of the calculations on which the old lunar year was founded must date from a very much more remote period, long anterior to the foundation of Ur or Eridu, and even before the still earlier Telloh. Up to the present time I believe no trace of a lunar year of thirteen months has been found in Assyrian literature; but the early immigrants to India brought, as I have shown, this year with them, and its use was continued in the Eastern country ruled by the Haihayas, or sons of the snake, down to the time when the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a were written, for in the latter work the thirteenth month is spoken of as that in which the gods brought Soma to the East. \"Therefore the thirteenth month\\(^2\\) is found unfit for any religious work to be done in it, a seller of Soma is (likewise) found unfit (for intercourse).\" \\(^3\\) The tone of this passage shows that it was written at the time when the Brahmans were trying to get the year of thirteen months discarded, just as had been done thousands of years before by the Assyrians and Egyptians. If the solar-lunar year was first introduced about 4700 B.C., as is apparently proved by the astronomical evidence, as well as by the early history of Assyria and Egypt,\\(^4\\) the time during which the lunar theology was\n\n---\n\n1 Dr. Sayce, in his Introduction to the Science of Language, vol. ii. pp. 195\u2013196, speaks of the old Turkish or Ural-Altaic year of thirteen months of twenty-eight days each, and of the Accadian week of seven days. He also seems to think that the primitive Turkish-Tatar horde who spoke the parent language of the Ural-Altaic speech is connected with the Accadians, who also spoke an agglutinative language.\n\n2 Two names of the thirteenth month are given by Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 371. One, Amhaspati, from the V\u0101jasaney\u0101 Samhita 7, 30 and 22, 31. The second, Malimlucha, from the K\u0101thaka 28, 14 and 35, 10.\n\n3 Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, i. 3, 12; Haug's translation, vol. ii. p. 26. See also i. 3, 14, pp. 33\u201334. From these passages it is clear that Soma worship was first introduced into the ritual of the Aryan Brahmans of India from the east. Another passage, Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, ii. 2, 22, p. 122, Haug's translation, which states that Soma was made intoxicating by being licked by an Asura woman, shows that it was originally introduced into religious worship on account of its intoxicating properties. The Soma rites must have been derived from the Baratas, or Bars, the Kolarian tribes of Eastern India, among whom the women prepared the beer to be drunk at the seasonal festivals. Mitra-Varma, according to the Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, made it non-intoxicating by mixing it with curds.\n\n4 The date of the rule of Menes, the first king of the dynasty, who was apparently like his successors a sun-worshipper, is fixed at about 5000 B.C. by Mariette, and about 3900 B.C. by Lepsius.\ndeveloped must be traced back to an extraordinarily remote period. In considering the length of time required for its development, and the strong probability that it would be very difficult to induce the Dravidian population who had once adopted it to give it up, one most important factor must not be overlooked. This is the national character of the Dravidian races, which can still be studied among their descendants in India. No one who has lived long among these people, and who has known them intimately, can fail to have been impressed by their indomitable obstinacy and perseverance and by their conservative and un receptive character. They are not stupid: on the contrary, they all think, but think in their traditional grooves; and their minds are in no sense of the word inactive. They appear at first sight to be incapable of either receiving or originating a new idea; but this estimate of their character will be modified on a closer acquaintance. It will then be seen that, like geological time, they do make new departures at long intervals, but, like it, they are always moving, but moving slowly and deliberately. When the fitting stimulus induces them to take up a new idea, and when they are thoroughly satisfied that it is expedient to adopt it, they make it their own, and adhere to it as faithfully as they did to those it has displaced; but what is new is always regarded for a very long period with suspicion and dislike, and among the great mass of the people the old traditions are never quite discarded.\n\nWhen the fact is once realized that it was this people who built the cities of Assyria and India, and probably those of Egypt, and who formed the government, founded the trade and manufactures, and developed the early religious systems of those countries,\u00b9 the acceptance of the correctness of this conclusion is shown to involve great difficulties. The only probable solution, as it appears to me, is that in the development of the complex civilization, which was produced under their guidance, they must have been assisted by another race of quicker and more subtle instincts, who made the discoveries\n\n\u00b9 As well as those of Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy. Proofs of this assertion are given in the subsequent parts of this paper.\nwhich the Dravidian rulers used, who, in short, originated and worked out logically and experimentally new ideas, while the Dravidians, as they were most competent to do, maintained law and order, and did justice between man and man. The gradual evolution of the system which was thus elaborated must have occupied an enormous time, and I should be rather inclined to say that the 4000 years assigned by some Egyptian archaeologists for the rule of the people who carved the Sphinx,\\(^1\\) and whom the ancient Egyptians called Har-Shesu, or the servants of Har, was more likely to err in defect than in excess of time. In estimating the length of this period, it must be remembered that the civilization of the early moon and snake worshippers, who brought this religion with them to India, must have reached a high stage of maturity when they entered that country. They brought with them, not only the elementary arts of agriculture, building, and the rudiments of manufactures, but also a tried and well-organized system of government, and a well-reasoned method of measuring time.\\(^2\\) But, even with all these advantages, it must have taken ages for the descendants of the first immigrants and for their successors to extend their rule over the whole of India, from the Himalaya on the north to Cake Comorin on the south.\n\nBut the early national development of the Accad races, which was well advanced before the colonization of India, and which culminated in a religion based on astronomical observation, was preceded by a totemistic period. It is in totemism that the germs of the earliest religious ideas, and also of those which prompted different tribes to join in forming a nation, must be sought. It is from totemism that the idea of God as the father and creator is evolved, and it is to this belief that the origin of the Accadian term \"Dingir,\" Creator, as applied to the great god, must\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Sphinx is a lion with a human head, and probably, as will be shown in the sequel, represented the moon-god.\n\n\\(^2\\) This is true even if they only brought with them the original division of the year into thirteen months, and imported later the astronomical elements introduced by the system of the Nakshatras. I have adduced proof in the Appendix to this paper to show that the names of the thirteen months are earlier than those of the Nakshatras, which took their names from the months.\nbe referred. When long-continued astronomical observations had disclosed the regular sequence, under a fixed law, of temporal and seasonal changes, the totemistic ideas of the descent of each tribe from a common father were enlarged into the idea of the existence of creators or fathers of all things in heaven and on earth; and on earth, at least, these creators were supposed to be three in number. It was this conclusion that led the early Accadians to make their ruling gods three in number, and this system of triads appears in the theology of India and Egypt, though it never took root among the Semite-Accads of Babylon.\n\nI shall now proceed to examine the early Accadian triads with those of the Egyptians and Hindoos, and with those of the Greek and Italian races. Dr. Sayce has shown clearly that the moon-god, whose worship is spoken of by Sargon as most remote, was the earliest supreme god of the ancient city of Ur, founded by Ur-Bagas, and he has also shown that he was represented by the Semite-Accads as the father of the Sun. This same order of descent is reproduced among the Hindoos, for we find in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata that the twelve \u0100dityas, or solar months, are described as the sons of \u0100diti, the first of the thirteen lunar months, while among the Greeks Kronos, the old moon-god, is father of the sun-god Zeus. I have also shown that the moon was the supreme god of the summer solstice, the culminating epoch and centre of the lunar year. It is therefore probable that in the earliest triads the moon would occupy a conspicuous place, and that if the triads represent the gods of the seasonal changes, he would appear in the centre of the triad, or in the place he occupied in the lunar year.\n\nAccordingly, in the Accad triad of Babylon we find the\n\n1 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, pp. 142, 143.\n2 I have given reasons in p. 529, note 2, and also later on in pp. 564, 565, for supposing that this division was made before the year of the three seasons was worked out.\n3 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, p. 110.\n4 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, p. 193.\n5 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, pp. 155, 165, 166.\n6 \u0100di (Sambhava) \u0100rva, lxv. p. 185. All references to the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata in this, as in previous papers, are to P\u0113t\u0101p Chundur Roy\u2019s translation.\ngods named as follows: Kur? nigin-g\u0101ra, the god who makes the palace,\\(^1\\) Sin, the moon; and Istar. The name of the first member of the triad is clearly one given by the Semite theological revisers, who thought that in a triad representing the three chief gods the Sun must have a place. Accordingly they put Samas, the sun, in the first place, and translated his name into a descriptive Accadian phrase, which suited their theology; but it appears to be almost certain that the god who originally was the first in this triad was Ana, or the heaven, meaning by the term the vital power residing in the abyss of the firmament. That this is the probable meaning of the heaven in this triad is shown by the Accadian belief that the \"Abzu,\" or abyss in which Ea, the great snake god, lived and worked, was the source of all things. It is the t'hom, or deep on which \"the spirit of the Elohim\" brooded in the Book of Genesis,\\(^2\\) and from which the generations of all things in the firmament below the heavenly mother and the earth were produced. In another triad, consisting of Anu, Bel or Mul-lil, and Ea, this Anu was the Accadian god Ana, who was \"the divine king of the illustrious mound,\"\\(^3\\) of which I have spoken before, and the supreme king of heaven.\n\nIn the first of these two triads Sin, the moon-god, appears in what seems to be his proper place as the chief god of the year and the ruler of the summer solstice, but in the second the Accadian Mul-lil, or the Semite Bcl, the sun-god is substituted for him. Now the word Mul-lil means the \"lord of the lil,\"\\(^4\\) i.e. the dust-storm, or cloud of dust,\\(^4\\) and he was made by the Semites the god of the ghost world, whose food was supposed to be the dust of the earth, and whose form was that of a dust-cloud. But this interpretation clearly does not give the original meaning of the god's functions, and though I shall show later on that the gods of the wind and the rain occupied a most important place in early theology, yet their position is rather that of subordinates of Anu than\n\n\\(^1\\) Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, pp. 167, 193.\n\\(^2\\) Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, p. 374.\n\\(^3\\) Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, p. 406.\n\\(^4\\) Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, p. 145.\nthat of independent creators; and it is clearly impossible that the god of storms, or the god of the world of ghosts, could be one of the creators of the upper world. But Mul-lil is not only the lord of storms, but he is also connected with the moon-god. Dr. Sayce shows that in the oldest documents found in the ruins of Ur the moon-god of Ur is identified with the moon-god of Nipur,\\(^1\\) and is called the eldest son of Mul-lil. In the tablet giving an account of the deluge the eldest son of Mul-lil is called Mul-nugi.\n\nMul-nugi is therefore one of the names of the moon-god, and he is represented as most closely connected with Mul-lil. The term Mul-nugi means in Accadian \"the lord of no return,\" and this title is perfectly appropriate when connected with Mul-lil, but could never have been given to the moon when it was the chief creative power in heaven and the lord of the seven spirits, who were called the messengers of Anu by the Semites, but who were really, as I shall proceed to show, the same powers who were called by the moon-worshipping Hindus the seven snake kings of Nishadha.\n\nI have already in my previous paper shown that the Nug, or great snake, was the name given by the Jews to the brazen serpent destroyed by Hezekiah, which had up to his time been maintained as an object of worship in the outer court of the temple,\\(^2\\) and by the Hindus to Nahusha, as the father of the N\u0101ga races, meaning the sons of the Nug. I have also suggested that the name of the mansions of the moon, or the parts of heaven visited by it in its yearly journey through the sky, was Nug-kshetra, or the places of the Nug or snake. Now, as the Nakshatras, and the lunar worship with which they were connected, were certainly derived from Assyria, the probability is that the \"Nug\" of the Nakshatras is the god of the vital creative power which was the original creator of all things and who was called Nug by the older Accadians. The moon, as the chief god passing continually through the heavens and regulating the changes of\n\n\\(^1\\) Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, pp. 154, 155.\n\\(^2\\) 2 Kings xviii. 4; also Prof. Robertson Smith's remarks on the passage in his article on the Totem Clans in the Old Testament in the Journal of Philology, No. 17, vol. ix. 1880.\nthe seasons, the lapse of time, and the yearly ebb and flow of\nthe vivifying powers of nature, would be rightly described\nas the lord of the \"Nugs,\" or snakes, and consequently the\nlord of the seven snake kings of Nishadha, which will be shown\nafterwards to be the gods of the wind and rain controlled by\nMullil, the lord of storms. When the moon-god was degraded\nfrom the chief place he originally held, the original positions\nof himself and Mul-lil were reversed, and Mul-lil, who was\nat first a subordinate, was made the father of Mul-nugi.\n\nThis view of the original significance of the term Mul-nugi,\nas applied to the moon-god, is further corroborated by an\nexamination of the other Accadian names of that deity. He\nis called Nagar, Nangara,\u00b9 and in one of the texts relating to\nthe deluge it is called \"the flood of the God Nangar (the\nmoon), the lord of the bond.\"\u00b2 The name of the moon-god\nat Ur was Nanuk, or Nannar.\u00b3 All these names point to an\noriginal root nearly, if not quite, equivalent to Nug.\n\nBut there is another name of the Accadian moon-god which\nalso proves the connection between him and Indian snake-\nworship, and adds to the evidence proving that it is in India\nthat we find the original form of the religion which preceded\nthat of the Semite-Accads in Assyria.\n\nThis is Lamga.\u2074 As the Accadian m before a guttural is\nusually changed into an n,\u2075 Lamga is the same word as\n\"langa,\" or the Indian \"linga.\" Linga means a mark or\nsign of sex, and is always used to denote the phallus set up\nin the temples of \u015aiva. This was the image of the god in the\ngreat temple of \u1e2a\u0101putra, the son of \u1e2aa, called also Somanath,\nor lord of the moon. The worship of \u015aiva I have already\nshown to be of Accad origin, as he was the chief god of the\nfirst month of the Accad lunar year. The word \"linga\"\nnever appears in the Rigveda, and is first used in Sanskrit\nin the early Sutras, and as it has always been specially\n\n\u00b9 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, p. 186, note.\n\u00b2 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, p. 504. The Pali-Hindi word Nagur or Nangur for\ncity, is probably derived from this name. The city was the \"Nangur\" or central\nmoon of its dependent villages.\n\u00b3 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, p. 156.\n\u2074 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, p. 186, note.\n\u2075 Sayce, Assyrian Grammar, p. 31.\nconnected with the worship of the snake gods, which was brought from Assyria, there is a strong original probability that the worshippers of these gods brought the name of the distinctive sign by which they were known with them; and, considering the reverence attached to the names of all religious symbols, it is exceedingly unlikely that these people would discard the name they had hitherto used for the sign of their god when they began to speak a Sanskrit dialect and take one from their new language. If the word they used is to be found in Accadian, it is most likely that it came thence into India. The name, therefore, denoted the mark or sign of sex, which, to the Accadians, denoted the moon-god, or lord of the \"Nugs,\" or snakes, the chief of the creators.\n\nWe now come to the third member of the triad, Istar, or Ea. Istar was a god who was especially worshipped at Erech, the city originally dedicated to Anu, the god of the sky, and afterwards sacred to Istar; while Ea, the culture god of primitive Babylonia, the god of wisdom and the instructor of his worshippers in arts and sciences, was the god of Eridu, the earliest home of Assyrian culture. Istar, who became afterwards the morning and evening star, was originally both a male and female deity like Il\u0101 in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, the great-grandfather and mother of the ancestral snake king Nahusha. Istar was called by the Sumerians, or Southern Accads, Gingira, or the Creator, and was clearly the generative power of nature existing in the earth as distinguished from that in the sky. Ea, who was symbolized\n\n1 As a proof that the tribes entering India from Assyria brought their own names of natural and sacred objects with them, and have retained these terms in common use down to the present day, I may note that in a Vocabulary of the Saura dialect taken down by me from one of the tribe in 1867 or 1868 in Chattisgarh in the Central Provinces, I find the Saura name for the Sun entered as Bel. The Saura were, as I have shown in Part II. of this series of papers, the Saos or Suvarnas, who were the Semite-Accads who brought the solar-lunar worship to India. Under this system the Sun was worshipped as Bel, and this name they still retained. Just as the Sauras still call the Sun by its Semite-Accad name, so I contend the descendants of the moon and snake worshippers call their sacred \"linga\" by its old Accadian name.\n\n2 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, pp. 254, 185.\n3 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, p. 245.\n4 \u0100di Parva, lxxv. pp. 229, 230.\n5 He was the god represented in the Asherim, the sacred pillars or linga which are so frequently spoken of in the Bible, 2 Kings x. 26; 2 Kings xviii. 4; Genesis xxviii. 19-22, and many other places.\nunder the form of a snake,\\(^1\\) was the water-god of Eridu, both a river and a sea-god, the god of the great deep, the rope or snake that bound the world, and the snakes that traversed it as rivers. He was also the god of wisdom. The manifold attributes of Ea mark him as subsequent to the earlier conception of Istar as the generative power residing in the earth. He represents a more elaborate form of the same myth, but he is not the generative power that issues from the earth, but that which resides in and comes from the water. As the great water spirit he fertilizes the earth both as the rain that falls from heaven and as the rivers which distribute their waters over the fields. He was the bond which binds heaven and earth, of which the moon is declared to be the lord in the hymn quoted above.\n\nThe above analysis shows that the original Accadian triad consisted of (1) heaven, the abyss or vault (Accad Abzu) where all things are born (Ana), (2) the vital power of the earth, and water, which is the generator and fertilizer of all things, and (3) the ruler of the two, the Moon (Mul-nugi), the great Nug, who, in his royal progresses through heaven, called the field of the Nugs (Nugkshetra), surveys all things, determines the times and the seasons, and is the central power, who, like the ideal king of the Dravidian race, regulates from the centre of his dominions the course of nature according to the divine law.\n\nThe conceptions set forth in the Egyptian triads are clearly analogous to those of the Accad theologians. There are three Egyptian triads, first that of Thebes, from whence the Memphite kings came down into Middle and Lower Egypt,\\(^2\\) second that of Memphis, and the third that of the popular religion. The gods in each triad are as follows:\n\n| Thebes | Amen-ra | Mut | Khuns. |\n|--------|---------|-----|-------|\n| Memphis | Ptah | Pakht | Imhotep. |\n| The popular Triad | Osiris | Hes or Isis | Horus. |\n\n\\(^1\\) Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, p. 134.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Egyptian evidence here dealt with is taken from the articles on Egypt, Apis, and the Sphinx, in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, ninth (i.e. the last) edition, except where other sources are specified.\nThe names of these gods clearly prove that the triads were arrived at by a process of metaphysical reasoning, and that in their present order they are based on the idea of sex, which Dr. Sayce has shown to be the ruling principle of Semitic theology as contradistinguished from that of the Accad triads which consisted only of male deities.\\(^1\\) Osiris is the husband of Hes or Isis, and Horus is their child, and the other two triads are similarly constructed. The meanings of the names of the gods in each are as follows: Amen-ra means \"tho hidden;\" Ptah, which is taken letter for letter from the Hebrew, means the opener or beginner; and Osiris is the productive principle, who is also known as Thut, the moon-god, which marks his lunar origin,\\(^2\\) and also shows that this system of triads is derived from the theology which made the moon the chief god. Mut is the mother, who, besides being the wife of Amenra, was the wife of Thoth, the moon-god. Pakht is identified with Isis in her malevolent aspect, that is, in her relation to the system of the older gods, and Hes or Isis is the counterpart of Mut. Khuns is the moon-god wearing the disk and crescent of the moon. Imhotep is, like the Accadian Ea, the god of wisdom, and Horus is, by the authors of the lunar-solar theology, identified with the rising sun; but he can be identified with the new moon, and this is what I think I can prove him to have first signified. He is certainly the god of the Har-shesu, the servants of Har, or Hor, who were the rulers of the country before the sun-worshippers of Thebes and Memphis. Their chief god was Thoth, or Thut, the moon-god, who was to them, as to the early Accads and Hindoos, the measurer of time, and who continued to fulfil this office under the system of the sun-worshippers. In the Egyptian list of months kept by the priests of the solar-lunar worship, Thoth gave his name to and was the god of the first month of the year. The Egyptian solar-lunar year began at the time of the inundation of the Nile, or at the summer solstice, and therefore the moon, as regent of the summer season, occupied the same place in\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, p. 110.\n\n\\(^2\\) Tiele, Outlines of the History of Ancient Religions, p. 48.\nthe Egyptian as he had done in the Accad-Hindoo lunar year when he ruled its culminating epoch, the summer solstice.\n\nThe clearest proof that Horus was originally the moon-god is given by the worship of Apis or Hapi, the sacred bull. Apis is the son of Athor, the Abyss, the counterpart of Isis and Mut, and is the symbol of the earlier Hesiri-Hapi, who became Osiris, who is also known as Thut the moon-god. His worship is said to have been introduced at Memphis by Kaiekos, king of the second dynasty. He also instituted the worship of Mnevis, the white or yellow bull,\\(^1\\) who represented the sun but whose worship never became nearly so popular as that of Apis. Apis, the black bull, was the most popular of all the gods throughout the whole course of Egyptian history. His counterparts and living representatives, who were after their death honoured with tombs built at the public expense in the sacred cemetery of the Serap\u00e6um, were always chosen from a black calf representing the darkness of the night. The chief distinguishing marks which determined the choice of the sacred animal were a white spot on the right side like a lunar crescent, and a white triangular mark on its forehead. The first of these marks must, I would submit, represent the new moon, and not the rising sun, for the triangular mark cannot be interpreted to have any reference to the sun. This latter mark represented the sacred triad under the symbol of a triangle. The apex, which was surmounted by the crescent-shaped horns, the symbol of the moon-god, who was one of the triad in which the sun did not appear. The triangular sign marking the triad with its apex surmounted by the crescent moon could never have been originated by the Semites, as it would have placed the son above the father and mother, whereas the Semites always placed the father at the head of the family.\n\nThe real meaning of the bull myth will be still more clearly shown by examining the evidence relating to Bel-Merodach, the bull-god of Eridu,\\(^2\\) who afterwards\n\n\\(^1\\) Tiele, Outlines of the History of Ancient Religions, p. 46, translated by Estlin Carpenter.\n\n\\(^2\\) Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, pp. 107 note, 289, 290.\nbecame the great Babylonian sun-god. Bel was originally the god of Nipur, and was the same as Mul-lil, whom I have already shown to have probably been, in his earlier form of Mul-nugi, the god of the moon. He was the Gudi-bir, the bull of light, or Gud-ana, the bull of heaven. He was the celestial bull who, as the moon, ploughed the great furrow of the sky, and in doing so prepared it for the harvest of creation, which was to appear after the sowing of the heavenly seed, and marked the track of the king of heaven and earth through the heavens, the field of the \"Nugs.\" He was also identified with the twelve months of the solar-lunar year, beginning the year as Dun-kun-e, the hero of the rising dawn or Mercury, who is also called \"the prince of the men of Harran,\" which was one of the chief seats of moon-worship.\n\nThis concatenation of evidence makes it exceedingly probable that Bel was originally the moon-god, that it was in this capacity as the father of the sun-god that he was first connected with the solar-lunar year, and that in Assyria first, and afterwards in Egypt, the moon was worshipped as the bull of light. Another proof that the moon-worship of Assyria, Egypt and India had a common origin is found in the reverence for the goat which in Assyria was especially sacred to Mul-lil, the former moon-god, in India was offered to Soma (the moon), and in Egypt, as the Mendesian goat, was sacred to Osiris, who had superseded the moon-god. This continued connection between the goat and the moon, which was abrogated by the later developments of religion in Assyria and Egypt, is another of the many proofs that in India we find the old worship common to all three countries in the least altered form. The connection between Soma the\n\n---\n\n1 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, p. 163.\n2 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, p. 286, where, in an extract from a hymn, Az\u016bga-s\u016bga, the supreme goat of Mul-lil and Merodach, i.e., Bel-Merodach, the son of Eridu, are mentioned together.\n3 Aitareya Br\u0101hm\u0101na, ii. 1. 8, and ii. 1. 3, pp. 91 and 80, Haug's translation, vol. ii.

The moon-god, who was originally in the centre, the place due to the Dravidian king, has been, in accordance with the Semite-Accad deification, often placed last after his father and mother and made a subordinate deity instead of the chief of the gods. In the Memphis triad the process has gone still further, and he has been spiritualized into the god of wisdom. The original triad must have been similar to the Accadian, and must have begun with Mut, the Mother or Abyss, answering to the Accad Ana, followed by Khuns, Osiris,\\(^1\\) or Thoth, the moon-god, the king of heaven and earth, the Accadian Mul-nugi, while Horus or Har answered to the Accadian Ist\u0101r, the first-born of Ea, the god of the vital principle residing in the earth.\n\nThe triad of the authors of the Rigveda is Dyaus, heaven; Agni, fire; and Prithivi, earth;\\(^2\\) or Dyu, Indra and Prithivi.\\(^3\\) In these two triads heaven takes the first place as in\n\n\\(^1\\) The name of Osiris, Asar, or Asiri, looks very like the Accadian Asari, the chief.\n\n\\(^2\\) Rigv. vi. 51. 5.\n\n\\(^3\\) Rigv. i. 131. 1. There is also the triad of Mitra, Varuna and Aryaman. These three are represented, Rigv. ii. 27. 1, as three of the six \u0100dityas, but they are in other hymns, such as Rigv. vii. 60, addressed as a separate triad. That they were originally lunar in their origin is shown in the \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, ii. 4. 4. 18, Prof. Eggeling's translation, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xii. p. 380, where Varuna is said to be the waxing and Mitra the waning moon. Mitra is Mithra, the god celebrated in the Mithr\u0101zast of the Zendavesta as \"the lord of the wide pastures,\" the god of the heaven of light, and, like the Sumerian Ea, as the god of wisdom. He held the same position in the later Persian calendar as the moon occupies in that of the Hindoos, as he gave his name to the seventh month, which was especially sacred to him as Kartik the month of the Dib\u0101li festival, and the seventh month of the Hindoo solar-lunar year is sacred to the moon. The sixteenth day of every month, the central period of each lunation, was also sacred to him (Art. Mithra\u015b, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, ninth edition, vol. xvi. p. 530.) Aryaman is, in a note by Sayana, on Rigv. 141. 9, Muir's Sanskrit Texts, vol. v.\nthe Accadian triad, but we find the second place allotted to Agni or Indra. Now among the Accadians the god of the fire-stick was one of the leading creators, and it was he who showed Merodach (the son of Eridu) where the seven evil spirits of the tempest lay hid.\u00b9 There is also, I think, very strong evidence that the god of the fire-stick, producing the sacred fire by friction, was also worshipped by the earliest Dravidian predecessors of the Semite-Accad sun-worshippers and occupied a prominent position among their gods. This evidence is to be found in the legend of Vinata and her two sons, Aruna and Ga\u1e47ura. Now Vinata is the tenth month of the Hindoo lunar year, and evidently means the twice-ten (vinsati) lunar periods of fourteen days each, completing the two hundred and eighty days, or the forty weeks required for the gestation of the children she was to bring forth. The children were Aruna the god of the fire-stick, only the upper part of whose body was developed, and Ga\u1e47ura, the sacred bird, who brought the snake races to India. Aruna is also the god of the undeveloped egg, the Martanda of the Rigveda,\u00b2 and the \u03bf\u1f30\u03b4\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, Oedipus, the swollen-footed king of Greek legend who interpreted the riddle of the Sphinx, the god of the moon-worshipping Har-shesu of early Egypt. Ga\u1e47ura is the Accadian Gudi-bir, the bull of light or the moon. They are the two sons of Mul-lil Uras, interpreted by the Semites as Adar, and worshipped at Nipur as the god of glowing fire, though he was a moon-god,\u00b3 and who was held by the Semites to be the son of the powers of darkness and the enemy of mankind. Ur or Uras may perhaps appear in the Hindoo form Aruna, but that the bird Ga\u1e47ura is the flying bull of light who brought the snake\n\n\u00b9 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, pp. 179, 180, also 469; Magical Text from Eridu, W.A.I.

As for Aruna, the name \u1f41\u03b4\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 suggests a derivation of the name from Iru, Ira or Ida, the Accadian for bull, so that the name would mean the bull-footed god, who diffused the light while standing still on earth, while his winged brother distributed it throughout space. It was Gudi-bir who, by his messenger Lugaltuda, the storm bird, and the Accadian counterpart of Ga\u1e0dura, stole fire from heaven, just as Ga\u1e0dura stole the Amrita or drink of immortality from the guardianship of Indra. In fact, we see in the two sons of Vina\u1e6d\u0101 and of Mul-lil, first Aruna or Uras, the god of terrestrial fire, who was, as the Aryan Brahmins said, born before his time, meaning that he was the god of the moon-worshippers before he became the god of the sun-worshippers, and according to his earlier worshippers, bull, or cloven-footed, and, secondly, Mul-nugi and Ga\u1e0dura, the fully-developed moon, which completed his period of gestation and was the winged messenger of the moon-god.\n\nThe whole story of the Hindoo legend is too poetical and imaginative to be entirely the work of pure Dravidian brains, though there is in it an element of realism and attention to practical fact which looks very like Dravidian workmanship. It is possible that the people who contributed the poetic and imaginative elements to the Dravidian legends were the cattle-herding tribes or perhaps rather the charioteers or Parthians, whom we find afterwards holding so prominent a place among the governing races of the Eastern or snake-worshipping provinces. The name Irav\u0101ta given to the snake-worshipping Haihayas appears to be derived from\n\n1 Iru, the bull, is the name of the second month of the Accadian year.\n2 The sign of the fire-stick in Hittite, Cypriote, and early Cuneiform, distinctly points to a cloven-footed form like that of the bull\u2019s foot. The signs, as given in an article by Major Conder, on the Three Hieroglyphic Systems, in the Archaeological Review for April, 1889, vol. iii. No. 2, p. 110, are as follows:\n   Hittite. Cypriote.

Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, \u0100di (Astika) Parva, xxxii. p. 108.\n4 The persistent evidence as to the early existence of tree-worship in all countries deriving their religion from Assyria apparently shows that there was a large Kolarian element in the aboriginal population.\nthe Accadian Ira, and we find in the Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a Ila or Ira explained to mean cattle.\\(^1\\) The trading races among these tribes were called the Asura (Aecad a\u015bari, the mighty chiefs or nourishers),\\(^2\\) and also the moon or the lion race (Sinha, the modern Singh), for the lion was named after Sin, the moon, which is represented by the early Egyptian moon-worshippers, the Har-Shesu, as the human-faced lion the Sphinx.\\(^3\\) The above evidence gives some reason for believing that at a very early period the tribes worshipping the fire-stick attained sufficient influence in Northern Babylonia, where Nipur was situated, to make their god Uras one of the chief gods of the country, and it was this god who disputed with Mul-nugi, the moon-god of Ur and Telloh, the chief cities of the Sumerian or Southern Accadians, the supremacy among the gods.\\(^4\\) Consequently these two gods were represented as being born together to the supremacy of heaven. Their respective worshippers, the descendants of the Northern Accadians of Nipur and of the Sumerians or Southern coast tribes near the mouth of the Euphrates, brought their gods to India, and the god of the fire-stick and the moon-god became the chief gods of the tribal triad according to the descent of the several tribes. The Dravidian races who were descended from the Sumerians worshipped the moon, and those who belonged to the North Accad tribes the fire-stick; but of these two gods the moon-god was the eldest, as Uras, the god of the fire-stick, is the son of the moon-god of Nipur, and the fire-worshippers were Northern immigrants who conquered the Sumerian moon-worshippers, but whose conquest was made after the lunar year had been fixed.\n\nHaving thus shown how the fire-god attained a place in\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, ii. 1. 9 and 10; Haug\u2019s translation, vol. ii. pp. 93, 96,\n\n\\(^2\\) Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, p. 284.\n\n\\(^3\\) These were the Dravidian Sombunsi, i.e. Sun or Sinbunsi, the sons of the moon or the lunar Rajputs. The solar Rajputs, who were descended from the \u015a\u0101ka-Sauv\u012bra or Ikshvakus, were also called the lion race, but the root li was used for lion in forming their name Licchavi, as I have shown in pp. 260 and 261 of J R A.S. Vol. XXI. Art. III. It appears probable that the earliest name of the lunar Rajputs was derived directly from sin, the moon, and the name Siniv\u0101ti given to the new moon (Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, 7, 2, 11). Haug\u2019s translation, vol. ii. p. 458, also shows that the earliest form of the later word Soma, the moon, was Sina, which is the same as the Accadian name.\n\n\\(^4\\) Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, pp. 151, 154.\nthe earliest Indian triad, I must now turn to Indra.\\footnote{Max M\u00fcller points out that Indra is derived from the same root as Indu, 'drop, sap,' Lectures on the Science of Language, 2nd series, 1st edition, p. 430.} He is a very similar god to Mul-lil, but one who occupied to the last a much higher position than Mul-lil, who was degraded to be ruler of the world of ghosts. He was the god of the winds and rain, and, like Mul-lil, the lord of storms; but he continued to be a heavenly power, as Mul-lil had once been, when the storms were the seven messengers of Ana sent to spy out the sins of the Babylonians,\\footnote{Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, p. 311.} and the seven winds who assisted Merodach, the moon-god, in his combat with Tiarmut, the t'h\u014dm or deep of the Old Testament, the prim\u00e6val chaos.\\footnote{Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, pp. 206, 374.} Indra was thus the lord of heaven and earth, as the ancient moon-god had been; but he represented a more metaphysical solution of the creation myth, similar to that which made Ea, the snake water god, a creator. He was the god who united heaven and earth, who rules the rain which fertilizes the earth and the winds which drive away evil influences. Prithivi is the earth, the home of the snake or the active vital principle which united with the heavens by the aid of the waters produces all things. The Grecian Triad of Zeus, Kronos and Poseidon is similar to the Sumerian triad of Ana, Sin and Ea. Zeus is heaven, Kronos is the old moon-god, the measurer of time, and Poseidon is the god of the fertilizing waters; but this triad is the successor of one still older, in which Kronos again took the middle or chief place, being the god who ruled Ouranos\\footnote{Ouranos is the Varuna of the Rigveda, which is interpreted by the commentators to mean the heaven of night; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, vol. v. sect v. p. 58. This is an additional proof that Kronos, the god of the heaven of night, meant the moon.} (heaven) and Gaia (earth). This last triad, very nearly the same as Ana, Mul-nugi, and Ea as the \"nug\" of the earth before he became the god of the waters.\n\nBut this system of triads extended even further westward than Greece, for we find among the gods of Etruria, who were called Aisur, a name very like the Accadian A\u1e63ari,\\footnote{Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 284.} the triad of Tinia, Uni, Menrfa. Of these Tinia was the\nheaven, and Uni became afterwards the Roman Juno.\\(^1\\) In her later form she was certainly a moon-goddess, as, like all moon-goddesses, she presides over childbirth, and the Kalends, one of the principal measures of time, were sacred to her, and it is therefore apparently indubitable that in the early days, when the gods were of no, or rather of both, sexes, Uni was the moon-god. As for Menrfa, he was certainly the snake-god, as the snake representing the vital power of the earth was the distinctive symbol of this deity.\\(^2\\)\n\nAll these triads, except that in which the fire-god takes the chief place (and which appears to be a local theology which did not, while unconnected with sun-worship, extend beyond Northern Babylonia and parts of India), show that in their earliest form they placed the moon-god at the head of the heavenly powers as the measurer of time, and in this capacity he was the fully developed year, accepted as the ruler of the seasons. If therefore the lunar year originated in Assyria, these triads must also have originated there, and it is all but impossible that systems so widely diffused, and yet, at first sight, so unlikely to be generally adopted over wide areas, should have been developed independently from different centres, and should have all formed the basis of the subsequent theological systems of the nations who adopted them. The natural and, what appears to me, the almost inevitable inference from the chain of reasoning now set forth, is, that the system of triads was originally developed and stamped firmly in the minds of the people, who originated it before the colonists, who took it with them to their far-distant homes, had set forth on their migrations.\n\nThe original theology thus disclosed being shown to be based on the lunar year, it remains to be seen whether in the division of that year into three seasons, each ruled by nine phases of the moon and two planets, making thirty-three gods divided into three groups of eleven each, completes the system of the old moon and snake-worshippers. A fuller examination of the authorities shows that this leaves a good deal unexplained.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Encyclopaedia Britannica*, ninth edition, vol. xiii. p. 778.\n\n\\(^2\\) *Encyclopaedia Britannica*, ninth edition, pp. 637, 639.\nDr. Sayce quotes an Accadian text which states \"the great gods to be fifty in number, the gods of destiny seven, and the An\u016bna of heaven are five,\"\u00b9 and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata speaks of the fifty daughters of Daksha, ten of whom were wives of Dharma, twenty-seven wives of the moon, and thirteen wives of Kasyapa.\u00b2 These fifty daughters are evidently the fifty great Accadian gods,\u00b3 while the five An\u016bna of the Accadians are the five planets. Of the fifty daughters of Daksha twenty-seven are the Nakshatras or phases of the moon, and thirteen are the months of the lunar year. It remains to be seen who the ten wives of Dharma are. I have already pointed out that Vinat\u0101, the tenth moon of the lunar year, indicated the period of gestation, and it is from this that we find a clue to the correct identification of the ten wives of Dharma. To complete the proof we must look to the Egyptian list of gods, for it is there alone that we find ten gods specially mentioned in five groups of two each. We find in Egypt two official lists of gods, one of Memphis and the other of Thebes. The Memphis list is as follows: 1. Ptah; 2. Ra; 3. Shu and Tefnut; 4. Seb and Nut; 5. Hesiri and Hes; 6. Set and Nebti; 7. Har and Hathor. This division of the gods into five sets, each consisting of two gods named in this list, must be very ancient, and must have been brought by Menes, the earliest recorded king, when he came from Thinis, in the Theban country, into Northern Egypt, as we find the same division in the Theban list. This list contains nine sets of gods, four single, and the remaining five being the same division into pairs as appears in the Memphis list. The first three single gods are Amenra, Munt and Atmu; then come the five pairs, and last of all Sebek, the crocodile-headed god of Arsino\u00eb.\n\n\u00b9 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, p. 183.\n\u00b2 Adi (Sambhava) Parva, lxvi. p. 189.\n\u00b3 They are also the fifty daughters of Endymion by Selene, the moon, and of Danans, the father of the Argive race. The legend of Endymion was endemic in Elis and the people of Argos are called by Homer Dana\u00ef. The name Dana\u00ef, so very like that of D\u0101nava, the name given in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata to the snake-worshipping tribes, which, as I have suggested in Part II. p. 265, may probably have been derived from the Accadian dam, strong. The early worship of Elis and the people of the Peloponneseus in Greece was certainly moon and Phallus worship. Hermes was worshipped at Cyllene in Elis under the form of the phallus, and Kronos, the old moon god, was guardian of the Olympian games. See articles Danans, Elis, Endymion and Olympia in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, 9th edition.\nA comparison of these two cycles with the thirteen months of the Hindu lunar year will at once show that in their original form they represented the months of the lunar year of the Egyptian worshippers of Har, called Har-shesu, and that the year apparently consisted of thirteen months.\n\nThe names of the Hindu lunar months as given in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata are as follows:\u00b9 1. \u0100diti; 2. Diti; 3. Danu; 4. Kal\u0101; 5. Danay\u016b; 6. Sinhik\u0101; 7. Kro\u1e0dh\u0101; 8. Pradh\u0101; 9. Visv\u0101; 10. Vinat\u0101; 11. Kapila; 12. Muni, or Daksha; 13. Kadru. These names are of course translated from an original Dravidian list, and the names of the first two months, \u0100diti and Diti, are alone sufficient to suggest that there was a very early division of the months into pairs, and this is further rendered likely by the name of the tenth month, Vinat\u0101, meaning the twenty or twice ten lunar periods. But if we compare each set of two Hindu months with the pairs of the Egyptian list, we shall find such similarity between the two lists as to make it exceedingly probable that the framers of the Hindu and Egyptian lists both took their groups from the same source.\u00b2\n\nThus for the Hindu \u0100diti and Diti we have the Egyptian Shu and Tefnet. \u0100diti certainly means the beginning, and the Egyptian Shu and Tefnet are interpreted to mean force and light. Tefnet is represented as a lioness, and was doubtless, before the Semites invented female gods, the male lion, or Sphinx, and meant the full moon. Thus Shu and Tefnet originally, like \u0100diti and Diti, were the first new and second full moon following the winter solstice. The appearance of the first full moon is still celebrated under the name of Pongol, as the chief annual festival of the Dravidians of\n\n\u00b9 Adi (Sambhava) Parva, lxv. p. 185.\n\u00b2 Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 370, gives even more cogent proof of the division of thirteen lunar months in India into pairs than that given by the list of months taken from the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. The names of these months as quoted by him from the V\u0101jasaney\u0101 Sambhita 7, 30 and 22, 31 are as follows: (1) Madhu and (2) Madhara, (3) \u015aukra and (4) \u015auchi, (5) Nabh\u0101s and (6) Nabhasya, (7) Ish and (8) Urj, (9) Sahas and (10) Sahasya, (11) Tapas and (12) Tapasya, (13) Amhaspati. That these pairs were originally male and female is exceedingly improbable, but that this Semitic innovation was afterwards extended to these names is clear from the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, where, as is shown in p. 306 of Part II. of this series of papers, Madhava becomes M\u0101dhav\u012b, and, as shown in p. 264, \u015auchi becomes \u015aachi, wife of Indra (\u015aukra).\nSouthern India, where it marks the beginning of the year, while the full moon of Phalgun marks the women's festival of the Huli.\\(^1\\) Next came Danu and Kal\u0101 with their Egyptian counterparts of Set and Nut, which last mean earth and heaven. This was probably also the meaning of the Hindoo pair, Danu (from the Accadian dan, the strong, the firm, the stable) meaning the earth, and Kal\u0101, or time, heaven. Then Danay\u016b and Sinhik\u0101 are like the Egyptian Hesiri and Hes, the productive principle of the strong earth and the receptive vault of heaven, the home of Sin, the moon whose name appears in that of the Hindoo month. He was the god of the people of Sindhu (the Indus), the river and country of the moon, whose name is also preserved in that of \"sindhu,\" or white moon-cloth, the name by which woven cotton is called in the earliest Accadian records,\\(^2\\) which mark the dawn of the historic period of Babylonian history.\\(^3\\) The next pair are Krodha and Pradha in the Hindoo, and Set and Nebti in the Egyptian year. They are the gods of the fall of the year after it had reached its highest point of perfection in the summer solstice, which I have already shown to be under the guardianship of the moon, who is represented in the lunar year by the month Sinhika. Krodh\u0101 is the wrathful goddess whose \"countless progeny were as wicked as herself,\"\\(^4\\) and Set is the evil principle who appears in the Hebrew Scriptures as Seth, the father of the wicked race of men who were destroyed by the deluge, who were probably the ancient moon-worshippers, the predecessors of the sun-worshipping Semites. Nebti is the protector of the dead, and Pradh\u0101 was the mother of the apsaras, the spirits of the abyss (the Accad apsu), and was apparently, like\n\n\\(^1\\) Alberuni's India, Sachau's translation, vol. ii. chap. lxxvi. p. 183.\n\n\\(^2\\) Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, pp. 136, 138.\n\n\\(^3\\) This derivation appears to me to be justified for the following reasons:\u2014First, there is no apparent Sanskrit derivation of the name. Secondly, the delta of the river, when it was first known as Sindhu, was inhabited, as I have shown in my previous paper, by a Dravidian population. Thirdly, that the Accads were accustomed, as is shown in the case of Sinai, to call sacred spots in foreign countries by the name of the moon-god Sin; and, lastly, that the name appears in Accadian inscriptions which Dr. Sayce thinks date from the \"very dawn of the historic period in Babylonia,\" and long before the Sanskrit-speaking Aryans entered India, Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, pp. 136 and 138.\n\n\\(^4\\) \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva, lxv. p. 186.\nNebti, regarded by the later sun-worshippers as the ruler of the ghost world. In the next pair, Visv\u0101 and Vinat\u0101, I have already explained Vinat\u0101 and Visv\u0101 merely means the beings. The two months signify the completion of the gestation of the living beings born on the earth during the year, and the same myth appears in their Egyptian counterparts Har and Hathor, who complete the cycle of the gods of generation, Hur or Hor being born from Hathor or Athor, the Abyss. Another very strong proof that the Egyptian pairs of two gods each meant the ten lunar months is apparently to be found in the myth of \u0152Edipus. I have shown above that \u0152Edipus is probably the sacred fire-stick, but he is the fire-stick of the solar, not the earlier fire-stick of lunar worshippers. In his answer to the riddle of the Sphinx, who is the moon-god, he said that man is the being who goes in the morning on four legs, in mid-day on two, and on three at night; but the number here given, nine, discloses the still further meaning that it is man who takes nine months to come into being. These months must be the solar months, and it was the acceptance of nine months as marking the period of gestation instead of the old lunar number of ten months, which was the mortal blow dealt to the lunar year. It was the substitution of nine months for ten that killed the Sphinx, and not the answer of \u0152Edipus, as is stated in the uncompleted myth, and hence the early Egyptians, who worshipped the Sphinx, must have believed in a period of gestation of ten months. Nine became henceforth the sacred number, which we find in the Theban cycle and in the nine Rudras of the Hindoo solar-lunar year. The Theban list, moreover, contains both the lunar and the solar-lunar system, for it contains the ten months of the productive period of the old lunar year, and the last three months, which are the generators.\u00b9 These appear as Amenra, Munt and Sebek, the position of Sebek at the end of the list showing the place they formerly occupied in it, while, to complete the whole cycle of knowledge, Atmu has been added to represent the sun, the god of the new year.\n\n\u00b9 See with reference to the order of the months, p. 558, note.\nthe Hindoo Calendar the remaining three months are Kapila (the yellow), Daksha (the power) or Muni, which was probably the more ancient name of the two, and Kadru, the mother of the snakes. Their meaning appears to be phallic in its early form, and to indicate the generation of the powers that were to produce the beings who were to be born during the gestation period of the ensuing year. It probably denotes the sacred triad of heaven, Kadru being the king of the snakes and their father, or generator, who was afterwards in the Semitic revision of the calendar changed into their mother.\\(^1\\) These three months do not appear in the Egyptian lists, as they were completely altered by the Semitic sun-worshippers, but they probably were the old triad mentioned by Prof. Tiele, consisting of Anuka (the embracing), the Accadian Anu, the Hindoo Kapila, the yellow vault of heaven coloured by the setting sun of the year, Khnum, the architect, or the motive power, answering to Munt of the Theban cycle, the god of war, and Sati, the generative power, the Scbek of the Theban list.\\(^2\\) But this comparison of the Egyptian and Hindoo lunar months does not complete all the evidence extant as to the original significance and sacredness attached to the ten months of the year, which represent the period of gestation. It seems from a remark of Dr. Mommsen, in his account of the Roman year, that the cycle of ten months was regarded as practically complete in itself.\\(^3\\) In speaking of the Roman Calendar, which he identifies with that of the early Italian races, he thinks that it began with an independent calendar of its own before it came under the influence of the duodecimal system of the Greeks; that at each of the phases of the moon the priests proclaimed the number of days which would elapse before the next phase; but the observation which bears most especially on the question I am discussing is as follows: \"The simplifying of the reckoning according to lunar months by the application of the decimal system, which was usual among\n\n\\(^1\\) Or perhaps as shown in the Appendix the original god was Tai, the mother.\n\n\\(^2\\) Tiele, Outlines of the History of Ancient Religions, p. 50.\n\n\\(^3\\) Dr. Mommsen's History of Rome, popular edition, translated by Dr. Dickson, vol. i. pp. 216-218.\nthe Romans, and the designation of a term of ten months as a ring (annus) or complete year, bear on them all the traces of a high antiquity.\"\n\nBut the special meaning of the term of ten months can only, as is seen from the examination of the Hindoo lunar year, be explained by considering these ten months as the lunar months which complete the period of gestation; and the occurrence of such similar and singular ideas among people so widely apart as the Hindoos and ancient Italians seems to make it very probable that these ancient people derived their interpretation of natural changes from the same quarter as their successors derived their language, the first from the countries watered by, and the last from the countries adjoining the Euphrates and Tigris. That this was actually the fact is by no means so improbable as it appears to be at first sight. There can be no doubt that in the early religion of Greece, which preceded the introduction of sun-worship, the moon and the snake were the chief gods. Hermes, as is shown by his staff, the \u03ba\u03b7\u03c1\u03c5\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd, round which two serpents were entwined in a knot, is a snake and phallic god; and the Roman Mercury, who was apparently an old Italian god, is his complete counterpart. Demeter, representing the productive and nourishing power of the earth, is depicted on the coins of Eleusis, where she was worshipped in the Eleusinian mysteries, as drawn by winged snakes; while the oracle of Delphi was merely the continuance of the earlier oracle of the snake Pytho, who was said in the legend to be slain by the Sun-god Apollo; and many other proofs might be added to this list.\n\nI have already shown in the Etruscan Uni and Menrfa the evidence for early snake and moon-worship in Italy, and this evidence is further corroborated by the ceremonies connected with the festival of the Lupercalia, which was one of the most ancient of the Latin festivals. The sacrifices then offered were two goats and a dog; these were not allowed to be touched by the \"flamen dialis,\" but were killed by the two Lupercal youths chosen from the tribe of Ramnes. The god to whom these sacrifices were offered\nwas, as Livy states, an old Italian god called Innuus, who was probably the prototype of the Etruscan Uni, and who was evidently, as the sacrifice of the goats shows, a moon-god, and similar evidence is also given by the fact that blows given by the Luperci with the thongs made of the skin of the slaughtered animals were held to prevent sterility in women.\u00b9 Considering the great reverence paid by all ancient nations to all old religious observances, it is, to say the least of it, exceedingly probable that the snake and moon-worshippers in ancient Greece and Italy belonged to the same race. In both countries the people afterwards adopted a solar-lunar year, and both used a language derived from Aryan stems, and if these later processes point to a common origin of the people of the two countries, the same reasoning will equally apply to their predecessors. In their case we find that the old language they used has disappeared, or become nearly obliterated, while the more venerated religious institutions have been incorporated into the system of their successors.\n\nDr. Mommsen argues that as the Italian months have totally different names from those adopted in Greece, the Roman year must have been independently formed. No doubt this argument is conclusive against those who contend that the Romans derived their year directly from the Greeks, but does not touch the contention that the earliest races which inhabited Greece and Italy both derived their year from the same source, from which their successors subsequently took their language, that is to say, from the countries known as Persia and Assyria. These early races, though coming originally from the same stock, separated very early, and developed the teachings they brought with them from their ancestral homes in different ways, though probably, if we could examine the unaltered religious forms of the early Greek and Latin Pelasgi, we should find them even more alike than those of their successors. If the Pelasgi were, as I believe them to have been, Dravidians, they would, owing to their conservative instincts, have\n\n\u00b9 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, ninth edition, vol. xv. p. 96, s.v. Lupercalia.\nresisted change much more stubbornly than their more imaginative successors.\n\nAfter this long digression I must now return to the old Roman year. An examination of the names of the months shows a great similarity to those of the Dravidian Hindoos. The lunar year must have originally begun with the month Januarius, which, like the Hindoo \u0100diti, means the opening month, and the month called December, or the tenth month, must, like the Hindoo Vinat\u0101, have taken place in September and October. The thirteenth month, which afterwards became the intercalary month, must have been Mercedonius, or the labour month, as under the solar-lunar system, when the year began in March, it was added at the end of the year after February, and if the name is derived from the same root as Mercury, it would answer exactly to the Hindoo Kadru, which, as the mother of the snakes, was, like Mercury, especially connected with them. The two months which would have to be transposed to make the tenth month of the lunar year fall into its proper place would be Quintilis (July) and Sextilis (August), and the fact that these names were afterwards changed by the Romans themselves seems to show that, having been once altered to meet the exigencies of the solar-lunar calendar, they had not the same sanctity attached to them as belonged to the other months. The months of the Roman lunar year therefore probably ran\n\nas follows: Januarius, Februarius, Martius, Aprilis, Maius, Junius, September, October, November, December, ( ), ( ), Mercedonius. The names of the eleventh and twelfth months are not now apparently recoverable, but the arrangement, both of the lunar and the solar-lunar years, shows a remarkable similarity to that I have already noticed in the Hindoo year. The name of the central month, Junius, is evidently connected with Innuus and Uni, who were probably the moon-god, and thus in both systems, as in the Hindoo year, we find the month of the summer solstice under the special guardianship of the moon. Perhaps the\nlast three months may have been some such triad as the Tinia, Uni and Menrfa of the Etruscans, Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva worshipped in the Ludi Magni, and the Kapil\u0101 Muni and Kadru of the Hindoos, and I have already shown that Menrfa is, like Kadru, specially connected with the snakes.\\(^1\\) It thus appears that the Roman year agrees with the Hindoo year (1) in the name of the first month, (2) in the special functions assigned to ten months of the year, and (3) in making the central month especially sacred to the moon; and another point of resemblance is to be found in the festival of the Lupercalia, which occurred on the 15th February, the second month, and which is strictly analogous to the Hindoo Huli, which occurs at the full moon of Phalgun.\\(^2\\) But this analysis, while showing that ten\n\n\\(^1\\) Perhaps this may not be the correct explanation of the order of the months, and the real order may have been as follows: 1 Janarius, 2 Febrarius, 3 Mercedonius, 4 Martius, 5 Aprilis, 6 Mains, 7 Junius, 8 Quintilis, 9 Sextilis, 10 September, 11 October, 12 November, 13 December. The numerals in this list correctly represent the places of the months in the year of gestation, which began in March, while the first three represent the three months of generation. The whole thirteen months thus represent a complete \"annus,\" or ring, composed of two smaller ones. This would account for the subsequent intercalation of Mercedonius, which, as Dr. Mommsen shows, used to take place in February when an additional month was required to correct the solar-lunar year. This would agree with the arrangement of the order of the gods in the Memphite and Thban Egyptian lists, where the ten gods ruling the months of gestation follow the names of the gods of the triad, and it would not be irreconcilable with the order of the Hindoo lunar months, as the thirteenth month, Kadru, is said to be the mother of the snakes, that is, of the whole body of moon-worshippers, while Vinata, the tenth month, is only the mother of Arma and Gadura, the fire-stick and the bull of light. Bohtlingk-Boh do not connect Vinati with Vinsati, twenty, but derive it from a root meaning to bow down, to bear. But for the order of the Hindoo months see Appendix.\n\n\\(^2\\) Another mark of a common origin of the religion of the nations of Greece, Italy and India is to be found in the religious festivals common to the three countries, all of which can be traced back to the very earliest periods, when, as I have tried to prove, the people wore all moon and snake-worshippers, and can be shown to have taken place everywhere at the same time of the year. Thus the Saturnalia in Rome, the Lenaea in Athens, and the Pongol festival in India, all took place in January, the first month of the old lunar year. The Dionysya in Attica, lasting three days, and the Lupercalia of the Latin races, are the exact counterpart of the Huli festival in Phalgun (February) in India. The Moonmaha to Artemis, the moon-goddess, the Palilia in Italy, and the sowing festival of the Hindoos and of the Kolarian tribes, all occur in April-May; but the chief festival month in all these systems is that of September-October, when the Ludi Magni at Rome were celebrated in honour of the sacred triad Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva. The counterparts of this festival in Greece and India are the Eleusinia of Athens and the Durgapuja, the great festival of Eastern India. While the simultaneity of the other festivals may be ascribed to a common adherence to the natural order of the seasons, which may have originated independently in different countries, this explanation will not account for the occurrence of the great festival of the\nmonths of the year were considered to fulfil separate functions from those belonging to the Nakshatras and the thirteen lunar months, has not completely exhausted the whole number of the ancient gods; there still remain the sacred seven, who were the gods of destiny and messengers of Ann, the seven assistants of the Egyptian Thut, the moon-god,\\(^1\\) and the seven snake kings of Nishadha. The examination of the lists of the lunar months shows that the framers of some of those lists which are now extant based their enumeration on pairs, and we consequently find the five pairs of months for the gestation period, the eleventh and twelfth months, made up the sixth pair, and to complete the sacred number seven, there was added what was in the eyes of the Dravidians an indispensable necessity in every well-organized state, a ruler or king. Again, the year and each lunar month began with the seven days, which, repeated, made up the full lunation, and this again repeated made up the full month, which, being again repeated three times over, made up the six seasons or ritu of the Hindoo astronomers,\\(^2\\) and these six seasons with their ruler completed the year. Thus the sacred seven, the Accadian gods of destiny, began and ended the year, and were the rope that bound together the whole heaven and earth according to the Accadian moon-worshippers. These seven made up the whole cycle composed of the fifty great gods of the Accadians, the fifty daughters of Daksha, of Endymion and Danans,\\(^3\\) who were the twenty-seven lunar periods, the thirteen months making forty, and the ten months of the period of gestation completing the whole fifty, the sacred seven rulers, and the five An\u016bnas, or planets.\n\nThe only point that appears to be still doubtful is as to the significance of the twenty-seven Nakshatras. The year, as\n\n\\(^{1}\\) Tiele, Outlines of the History of the Ancient Religions, p. 49.\n\\(^{2}\\) Alberuni's India, Sachau's translation, chap. lxvi, vol. ii. p. 180.\n\\(^{3}\\) See note 3, p. 550.\nwe have seen, was completed in twenty-six lunar periods, but this only made up 364 days. The question is as to whether the early astronomers found out that this calculation required revision by the interposition of intercalary days, and consequently retained the twenty-seventh lunar period for this purpose, or if not, why did they originally put it in the Calendar? If the intercalary days had been habitually added by the authors of the lunar year whenever such addition appeared to be necessary, the probability is that this custom would have been retained by the authors of the new solar year; but all extant evidence points to the late introduction of periodical revisions of the Calendar, and when this was found to be necessary, the lunar periods were increased to twenty-eight so as to allow of the addition of a new month.\n\nThe Egyptian vague year, which appears to have been the original if not the only real Egyptian year, was based upon the return of all time to its original point from which it started, a cycle of 1461 years, beginning from the culmination of the Star Sothis (Sirius), and certainly did not provide for periodical revisions, and the name of Vi-adar,\\(^1\\) the month added to the Hebrew year, as well as the Arhu-Makru the reduplication of Addaru, the intercalary month of the Semite-Accad year, seem to show that these additions were made as an afterthought when the year was found to be continually failing to represent the return of the seasons at the right annual period. These additions were at first made without any fixed law, and it was only at a later period that the law of the periodical addition of a month, which marks the Rabbinical Hebrew and the Muhammadan years, was worked out. The twenty-seventh Nakshatra appears to have been included in the gods owing to the necessity of a ruler, which, as explained before, was a primary and fundamental tenet of Dravidian ethics.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe obvious objection to the correctness of the view I have\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mr. P. le Page Renouf has, in an article in the Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, vol. iii. part ii. 1874, shown that the Egyptian astronomical observations were based on the culmination, not as Brugsch supposes on the rising, of the stars.\n\n\\(^2\\) See Appendix, where the whole question is more fully discussed.\nproposed in this essay is that it is impossible that in such early times there could have been such an intimate connection between Assyria and Egypt, Assyria and India, and Assyria and Greece and Italy, as to make Assyria the starting-point of the theology, governing system and the religious festivals of Egypt, India, and the countries in which European civilization was founded. The records of Assyria, however, show the existence of a very early trade by sea between the Sinaitic peninsula and Assyria, for it was thence that the sculptors of Telloh got the material of their statues, and these statues show a very intimate connection between the Telloh and the Egyptian builders, as the scale of the plan of the city held in the hand of one of them is precisely the same as that of the Egyptian pyramid builders. The coincidences between Egyptian and both Hindoo and Assyrian mythology, which have already been pointed out, could hardly have arisen fortuitously; and if they were derived from the same source, that source must have been Assyria, and the original and fundamental religion which was thence disseminated through all the adjoining countries must have been snake and moon-worship.\n\nIn Egypt the original king god, the Ra, who is by his later worshippers depicted as the enemy of the snake Apap, must have been a snake and moon god, for he is, by the later sun-worshippers, depicted as wearing the Uraeus snake as a coronet, and the snake was one of the signs of the Egyptian king, as is shown by his appearance on the head-dress of many of the old statues.1 The snake of the old religion is the enemy of the sun-worshippers among the Assyrians, Egyptians, Hindoos, and Greeks, and he appears as the deposed king of these countries in the story of the temptation in Genesis. Almost all scholars, I think I may say without contradiction, agree in thinking that the four rivers of the Garden of Eden are the Nile, the Euphrates, Tigris and Indus, and the author of the account of the Garden of Eden in Genesis makes it the source of all of\n\n---\n\n1 See the head of Seti I. fig. 192, in Maspero's Egyptian Archaeology, translated by Miss Edwards, p. 224.\nthem. That this could ever have been thought to be literally the case by the writer is only possible on the supposition that he was speaking of countries with which he had only the vaguest acquaintance, but he knew perfectly well that India produced gold, onyxes, and the precious stone translated bdellium. He must therefore have heard of India as a country which had a large foreign trade even in those early times, and if he knew this of India, he must have known enough of Egypt to know that the Nile came from the south, and not from the north, as was the case with the other rivers of Eden. But it is not by any means necessary to suppose that in making all these rivers rise in the Garden of Eden, he meant that the actual rivers did so. Throughout this series of papers I have shown numerous instances in India where the people living on the banks of certain rivers are called the sons of the rivers; and if this is once admitted, and it is conceded that these rivers meant those of the Egyptians, Assyrians, and Hindoos, it would follow that in speaking of the rivers the tradition spoke of the people to whom they gave their names, as the Sindhu did to the Hindoos, and in that case its meaning would be clear. What it meant to say is that the people of the Garden of Eden traced their origin to Assyria, which is the very proposition I have now tried to prove.\n\nThe probability therefore is that the writer speaks of the people of the lands of Havilah and Cush as coming from Assyria, having emigrated to those countries from the place where they were created. Dr. Sayce has shown that Babylonian tradition, which was doubtless that followed by the Biblical writer, places the Garden of Eden in Eridu.\\(^1\\) Eridu was the great port of Assyria at the mouth of the Euphrates sacred to the great snake Ea and the earliest home of the Moon-god, Bel-Merodach, and it was doubtless from thence that the emigrants went forth to India on the East and Egypt on the West. Though the first emigrants probably went by land, yet intercourse by sea must have been carried on from a very early period, and\n\n\\(^1\\) Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, p. 238.\nthe ships which brought the stone of the Telloh statues from Sinai must have been preceded by many generations of voyagers. The men of Eridu were always bold navigators, and it was by means of the arks or ships which, as Dr. Sayce shows,\\(^1\\) play such an important part in Babylonian and Egyptian ritual, that many at least of the later emigrants made their way to their new homes. Though the distances to be traversed, especially to Egypt, were very great, they were not more than was accomplished by the Norsemen of the Northern seas, and nothing like the voyages made by the ships sent to India by Solomon. The eighty-one Cuneiform tablets lately found in the tombs of the eighteenth dynasty, and now deposited in the British Museum, prove that there was constant communication between Egypt and Babylonia as early as 1700 B.C., and if the relations between the two countries were as intimate at that date as these tablets prove them to have been, there is no reason why this intimate connection should not have begun at a much earlier period. If the derivation of the early Egyptian from the Accadian theology, which I have attempted to prove in this paper, be accepted as correct, this intercourse must have been begun thousands of years before the solar-lunar dynasty of Menes founded the official chronology of Egypt, at a time which must have been nearly synchronous with the adoption of the solar-lunar Calendar by the Semite-Accads of Babylon. Navigation in those seas, owing to the regularity of the winds, was easy, and once the journeys to distant countries had been accomplished and profit made by the voyage, other traders would be sure to follow the first pioneers. It is clear that at a period long before the earliest authentic Egyptian history, the men of Eridu were a cultured race, who had worked out a solution of the mystery of creation which certainly speaks most highly for their intelligence and education. They had formed their own civilization, had evolved the elementary discoveries which lie at the basis of\n\n\\(^1\\) Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, pp. 66-68.\nall national life. They had built cities large enough to be trading centres, learnt the rudiments of agriculture, and being a people living on the sea had made sea-going vessels, and had learnt that the sea voyages were the easiest and most expeditious modes of travelling and trading. Such a people must have had a long extended social history and must have mingled with men of other countries, and worked out, not only the problems treated of in their theology, but the science of government and the laws of trade, the great promoter of international intercourse, and must consequently have made distant voyages to foreign countries.\n\nI have not in this paper dealt with these latter problems, but I may say that any one who examines the forms of Egyptian Governments will find them almost precisely like those of the Dravidian kings of India, and, if my present conclusions are correct, this similarity will also extend to other departments of national life. This complete investigation will, I believe, firmly corroborate my present conclusions, that it is most probably to the Sumerian Accads that the earliest stable form of government in Egypt and India is due. That it is they who were the Har-sheshu who founded the most ancient sanctuaries of Egypt at Denderah, Edfu and Abydos,\\(^1\\) long before the days of Menes, who built the cities of India, the oldest of those of Assyria, and that it is to them that these countries owe the most solid part of their civilization and their early culture.\n\nThe conclusions I have tried to establish in this paper, and in the latter part of Part II. of the same series, relating to the early Hindoo lunar calendar are as follows: (1) That when the Accad Dravidians, who first made the lunar calendar, emerged from totemism, their first national god was the creative power, which seemed to them to be the father and mother of all things, and which they worshipped under the symbols of sex embodied in the linga and yoni,\n\n\\(^1\\) Maspero, Egyptian Archaeology, translated by Miss Edwards, p. 61.\nwhich became further symbolized in the union of the snake with the earth. (2) When they proceeded further to believe that the same creative power which originated all things on earth also ruled the heavens, they came to the conclusion that the moon, which was the heavenly body, which they saw constantly undergoing periodical changes, was the representative of the central vital power which gave life to all things. (3) They regarded the recurring changes of the moon as separate gods, and the first divine cycle they framed was that given by the ten complete lunations which were required to complete the period of gestation. (4) Probably this was what we find it to have been among the Latin races, the first and most archaic form of the year. (5) This was subsequently found, by continued observation, not to be a sufficiently definite measure of time, and it was discovered that thirteen full lunations were required to complete the year, so as to make the calendar a record of the return of the seasons. They consequently increased the year to thirteen months, though whether they made the original ten months of gestation the first or the last months of the completed year seems to be doubtful. (6) As the moon was under this system the only measurer of time, it was made the guardian and ruler of the summer, the culminating epoch of the year. (7) The Nakshatras or embodiments of the phases of the moon were probably a later addition made after a more lengthened period of scientific study, and we do not find any trace of them in the early Latin and Egyptian years. (8) It was after the Nakshatras were recognized that the first cycle of astronomical changes was adopted, consisting of the fifty great gods of the Accads and the fifty daughters of Daksha. In this cycle were included the ten months, making the year of gestation the thirteen months of the full lunar year, and the twenty-seven Nakshatras marking the path of the moon through the heavens. (9) The sacred Hindoo number of thirty-three gods seems to have been a later development of the earlier lunar system. It seems that in this arrangement of the heavenly powers the seasons, and their ruling celestial chiefs,\nwere for the first time accepted as determining factors in the calendar, and it was this improved lunar year which seems to have been finally accepted by the Hindoo Accad Dravidians. It was upon this that they based their system of thirty-three gods, divided into three groups of eleven, though from the allusion quoted in p. 529 of this paper to the elevenfold division of the Accad snake-gods, the system seems to have been originally worked out by the astronomers of the Euphrates Valley.\n\n(10) The further refinement of the dual arrangement was perhaps the last phase of the developed year, making it a complete compendium of the fundamental principles accepted as the groundwork of this early materialistic philosophy.\n\nOf course this detailed attempt to describe the order of the evolution of the first measurement of time is, in the absence of any record of the history of the process, based to a great extent on conjecture. But the proof of existence of each separate phase of belief has been given in this series of papers, and the whole reasoning is founded on the admission that the system of calculating by lunar years, which was the first adopted by early civilized races, originated in the Tigris and Euphrates Valley.\n\nThe coincidences that I have pointed out between the early Latin and the Hindoo-Accad year seem to make it exceedingly probable that they both came from one source. I would further submit that it is almost indubitably proved in the present series of papers that the Hindoo-Accad year was brought to India from the Euphrates Valley. The year of thirteen months could never have been framed except by a people devoted to astronomical science, and there is no trace of astronomy having been cultivated in the very earliest times, except among the people of Chaldaea and Babylonia. The Egyptian astronomical observations which have come down to us are of a much later date than those recorded in the earliest Accadian traditions, and refer almost entirely to astrology, a much later development of\nthe early inquiries made to discover the means of measuring time.\\footnote{The calendar of the fifteenth century B.C. is shown by Mr. Renouf, in the Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, vol. iii. part ii. 1874, to deal entirely with the motions of the stars.}\n\nThe chief objection to the truth of the deduction I have made seems to be based on the enormous periods of time it postulates, and the impossibility of the existence at so remote an epoch of any civilization so far advanced as that which my conclusions require. To those who object on these grounds, I would point out that the history of Sargon, the conqueror of Cyprus in 3750 B.C., points to a very developed civilization at that early period, while the monument of the Sphinx in Egypt tells of a still earlier cultivated race which ruled the country before the solar-lunar kings of Egypt, who date back to more than 4000 years before Christ. The solar-lunar calendar must, as Dr. Sayce shows, have been adopted about 4700 B.C., and the reference to the ruined mound of Borsippa in the Semite-Accad calendar shows that astronomical observations had been carried on in buildings made for that purpose long before that date.\\footnote{Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 115.} The Sphinx monuments found near the ancient Miletus in Caria, and the golden Sphinxes found in the tombs of Mycenae, prove that the sphinx and moon-worship both existed at a very early period in Asia Minor and Greece, and that the golden Sphinxes came from Egypt. There seems to be no proof whatsoever that the Sphinxes of Miletus came from the same source. There is no reason of any kind which can lead to the belief that the Egyptians colonized Miletus, for their ancient enemies, the Hittites, were too firmly settled in the intervening country to make the Egyptian conquest of Caria possible, while there is apparently very strong proof that the earliest inhabitants of Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy came from the Euphrates Valley, bringing their ancestral moon-worship and their civilization with them. The Hittite rulers of Lydia and the founders of the pre-Hellenic cities of Smyrna, Samorna (Ephesus), Myrina, Cyme, Priene, and Pitana, were phallus-worshippers, and\ntheir moon-god called Menes, or Men, stood by the side of Attys, who represented the Istar-Tamnuz, or phallus-worship. The representation on the tomb of Midas in Phrygia of the sphinx sacred to the moon gives further proof that moon and snake, or phallus-worship was almost universal throughout Asia Minor.\\(^1\\) The name of the mountain Ida, which was alike sacred to the people of Greece and Asia Minor, is apparently the Accadian Ida or Ira\\(^2\\) the bull, and this and the name of the Bosphorus, which gave a passage to the bull (of light) from Asia to Europe, are two further proofs of the Accadian origin of the early Greek religion, besides those I have already advanced. If it be once admitted that it was the moon and snake-worshipping Dravidian races who originated the civilization of Greece and Italy, the recent archaeological investigations made by the Italian Government sufficiently prove its very great antiquity in Italy. Remains of an ancient dwelling have been found on the Alban Mount between two strata of volcanic ashes, showing that the country must have been peopled by a race so civilized as to build substantial houses when the Alban Mount was an active volcano, and when, consequently, the geological features of the country were totally different from those recorded in the very earliest Latin traditions. Early bronzes which have been found in a lake deposit not later and perhaps earlier than 1500 B.C. point to a high civilization at that date. Inscriptions at Karnak, in Egypt, prove the Tyr, who are the Tyrhenians or Etruscans, to have been a flourishing and powerful Italian people about 1500 B.C., and the well-shaped tombs found at Sybaris, Corneto, Vetulonia, and Civita Castellana, prove the existence of a complete civilization much earlier than that of the Etruscans; as the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See Lydia and Phrygia, Encyclopaedia Britannica, ninth edition.\n\n\\(^2\\) The union of Zeus with Hera on Mount Ida is apparently an old tradition used by the author of the Iliad, bk. xiv. p. 152 seqq., for the purposes of the story he is telling. The tradition seems to point to the amalgamation of the old moon-worship with the new sun-worship. The sanctity attached to both the mountains called Ida, one near Troy and the other in Crete, also prove that the name was one associated with religious reverence, and therefore it is exceedingly likely that the name was that of the Accadian Ira, the bull of light, which was, as I have suggested, first a name of the moon-god, and afterwards of his successor the sun-god.\nwell-shaped tombs are found at Vetulonia and Corneto below the much later Etruscan chamber tombs. These conclusions are also confirmed by the excavations made by Signor Gamurrini at Falerii.\\(^1\\) There is therefore no antecedent improbability in believing that a civilization which was so fully developed at so very early a date could trace its origin back for several thousand years; for if the traces of this very early civilization still remain imbedded in our institutions, in spite of the many rival systems that have arisen in later times, it is likely that the earliest forms should, when entrusted to the keeping of tribes so conservative as the ancient Dravidians, have remained undisturbed for many thousands of years, while the progress of such a race from barbarism to a state of culture must have occupied a very long period. When all these points are considered, it appears probable that the exaggerated periods of the Brahmin and Buddhist chronology of India are not so very far from giving a true estimate of the length of the periods which have elapsed since stable governments were founded in India as they have hitherto been supposed to have been.\n\nBut all such reasonings as these are at best only based on probabilities and possibilities. The main question to be solved is whether the snake and moon-worship, which we find to have been the earliest form of religious and scientific belief in all countries, from India in the east to Italy in the west, sprang from several centres or only from one. If it be admitted that all, or nearly all, the evidence is in favour of this belief coming from a single source, this worship, with its concomitants, must have originated in Assyria. If the available proofs of this conclusion are considered insufficient, it is for the opponents of this solution of the question to show what the other centres, besides Assyria, were, and what other people, except those living in the Euphrates Valley, can be shown from the very earliest recorded times to have pursued the astronomical studies which must have preceded\n\n\\(^1\\) These facts are taken from notes I made of the review in the *Times* of the reports of the Italian Survey published, as far I recollect, in April, 1888. I am sorry I have not been able to verify them by a reference to the originals.\neven the earliest and rudest form of the lunar year, which is apparently that of the Latin races.\n\nThe results of the inquiries which I have set forth in the preceding pages seem to me to show that it was the people called the black-headed sons of Ea, living in the southern and eastern part of the united valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates, who, with the assistance of the Northern Accads of Babylonia, and that of other more imaginative tribes living in the same locality, worked out the solutions of many of the most important political, theological and scientific problems which I have described in the present series of papers. These explanations of the mysteries of life, and of the laws of social well-being, had been gradually unfolded in their minds first by their constant efforts towards securing a social organization which satisfied the requirements of their very practical minds. From this point they were led by their desire for knowledge to enquire into the laws regulating the sequence of the changes in heaven and earth, which they saw recurring yearly before their eyes, as well as those which defined the relations between the heavens above them and the earth on which they lived, and the reasons of the constant mutual influence they exercised over one another.\n\nThe form of government of this people was based on the organization of a nomad camp. Their constitution was tribal, and the tribe among the Dravidians was the important unit, not the family, as among the Semites. They were exogamous, that is to say, the fathers of the children of the tribe were sought for out of another clan, for there was no family life among them.\u00b9 The women, who occupied an im-\n\n\u00b9 They, like the women of the Amazonian race described by Herod. iv. 110 (Encyclopaedia Britannica, ninth edition, vol. i. p. 655, Art. Amazons), paid annual visits to the neighbouring tribes to increase their stock of children, just as now the girls of a Dravidian village visit and dance with the young men of another in the neighbourhood. These visits now result in marriages or permanent unions, but anciently they were only temporary. Herodotus's account of the banishment and crippling of the males was doubtless gathered from sun-worshipping informants who looked on the old Dravidian moon-worshippers and their tribal customs, which were so totally opposed to their idea of family life, in the most unfavourable light. Herodotus's further account of the Sarmatians, iv. 110\u2013117, the great riding race of Central Asia, shows that among them the women occupied a position similar to that of the Dravidian women. They rode, hunted and took part in battle with the men. They are probably the horse-owning tribes of India called\nportant position, and who were frequently rulers of the tribe, were the mothers, nurses and educators of the tribal children. It was they who reared and tended them till they reached an age which permitted their entrance into the homes for young men and young women, which were maintained in every tribal section. These homes are, as I have previously explained, now maintained in every Dravidian village. In the days when each of the different clans which formed the united tribes lived together, the organization was entirely clannish, and it was only altered afterwards, when the village communities were formed. Whether they ever founded a system of village communities of their own, or whether they merely appropriated that already formed by other races, appears to be doubtful. In India the evidence extant certainly proves that the original villages were formed by the Kolarians, and that the Dravidians appropriated their village and provincial system, altering it to suit their own plan of government.\n\nAs they were exogamous, friendly relations between neighbouring clans were necessary, after the custom of unions by capture had ceased. Each confederacy formed by these allied and related clans was ruled first by the chief of the central camp, which became, when they had taken to a stationary life, the central village or city. The chief was assisted by his council, composed of the leading inhabitants of the city, and of delegates from the councils of the affiliated villages. These had been formed either by emigration from the central tribe or by alliances with neighbouring clans which desired the aid and protection of their powerful neighbours.\n\nThe chiefs of these subordinate clans or villages were probably among the Dravidians always appointed by the head of the state, who, as general in chief, had the right to select his own officers, and in this the Dravidian kingdoms and provinces differed from those of the Kolarians or Aryans where the offices were elective.\n\nThese cities, with their dependencies, formed provinces\n\nGandh\u0101ra, who are shown in Part II. to have entered with, or shortly after, the Dravidian tribes called Haihayas.\nowing allegiance to the central ruler, though this probably was a later development, and the original constitution was an alliance between the neighbouring cities, each with their several dependencies such as we find existing in Canaan in the days of Joshua, in early Greece, and in Italy. These cities were united together by the bond formed by the mutual trading advantages conferred by the maintenance of the alliance. The mutual relations between each city and its dependencies, and each province of the larger kingdoms, and the capital city, were kept up by the administrative organization of local councils, which preserved constant touch with the governing body and the consideration of all matters of common interest by the central council, presided over by the chief of the confederacy.\n\nUnder this system all members of the community were from the first trained in their duties, and had, under the limitations considered necessary for the preservation of law and order, an interest in the well-being of the state. Every one could aspire to a voice either in the subordinate or central councils, and could become either a leader among his fellows, or, at least, a willing worker with others for the common good. On the other hand, any remissness in the performance of prescribed duties or any infringement of the rules laid down by those in authority was severely punished.\u00b9 These rules of social polity were all based from very early times on trading interests. It was for trading purposes that the Dravidians made war, and when successful their first endeavour was to unite themselves with the conquered tribe, which became either a component part of the enlarged state or an allied dependency. They had very early grasped the idea that the prosperity and progress of the community depended on trade, and on the mutual and willing efforts of each member of the body politic to fulfil the task appointed for those holding his or her place in the organism.\n\n\u00b9 The Dravidian customs bear a strong resemblance to those of the Dorian Spartans and Cretans. The Sussitia, or common-messes, of the Spartans and Cretans are distinctly Dravidian customs. The same may be said for the council of the elders (Gerousia), the Ephors, and the important place assigned to women in Sparta.\nThey understood that the mutual interchange of commodities was the surest guarantee of peace, and that reciprocal trade between well-organized communities was far more profitable than war.\n\nThe duties of their chiefs were to keep peace and good order among the members of the confederacy, to do justice between man and man, to see that trade was carried on peaceably, and that all engaged in it, whether foreigners or fellow-tribesmen, were protected in their persons and goods. They had to maintain an efficient force for the defence of the country from hostile attacks, and well-appointed fortresses, while in the better organized kingdoms a well-organized police was also kept up.\n\nBut these Dravidians did not content themselves with founding a system of government and social polity fitted to develop individual freedom and energy, while repressing excess and assuring the maintenance of all rights which were not public wrongs. They also worked out in their calendar a system which, when finally completed, appeared to them to be a thorough explanation of the origin and orderly sequence of natural phenomena. This they embodied in their year under three aspects, each showing a different view of the questions they proposed to solve. The first in order of time looked on the year as the manifestation of the great generating power, which superintended, directed, and organized the increase and multiplication of individuals and species. Of this year ten months were those of conception, gestation, and birth, and three were those of generation. In the second aspect the year was looked on as the measurer of the times and seasons by means of its thirteen months, represented at a date much later than the adoption of the lunar year as an isosceles triangle culminating in the summer solstice ruled by the moon, and descending again in the last six months till it reached the level from which the new triangle formed by the coming year was to ascend. In its third aspect, framed after the metaphysical arguments involved in the conception had been worked out, the year was regarded as the cycle within which the yearly sequence of\nnatural changes was evolved. For this purpose it was divided into three seasons, each controlled by its eleven gods, the ten gods of conception and gestation and the power that regulated their action.\n\nOn leaving their homes in the neighbourhood of the Euphrates Valley, even the earliest emigrants carried with them part of this elaborate system of government, organization and astronomical speculation. If they had gone merely as nomads, they would have had to work out these problems independently; and as there is a great similarity in all the early solutions, the probability is that before they separated the race had reached a stage of progress which had impelled them to consider and partly to solve what appeared to them to be the most pressing questions. It is clear that the carefully reasoned products of long-continued observations could not have been accepted and embodied in their creeds by the early races of India and Egypt if the first immigrants into these countries had not brought with them the solutions that had been worked out before they left their homes, and if they had not kept up that continual intercourse with the parent country which enabled them to receive and adopt additional discoveries made by the Assyrian observers. The immigration into India must have taken place at a very remote period to allow of the Dravidian Accads establishing themselves in well-organized kingdoms throughout the length and breadth of the land. All these kingdoms must have been formed before the advent of the Semite-Accads, who brought with them the solar-lunar system, with its attendant fundamental changes. If, as is probably the case, the earliest immigrants came by land, intercourse by sea must have been established at a very early period; for it is only by a maritime trade that continual intercourse could have been kept up between Assyria and India, and that the cities, the system of agriculture, the mining enterprises, and the well-organized governments, which were all based on a flourishing internal and foreign trade, could have been founded and maintained.\nAPPENDIX.\n\nPROOF OF THE LUNAR ORIGIN OF THE HINDU MONTHS.\n\nAlberuni, chap. xix. (Sachau's translation, vol. i. p. 218), proves that the classical names of the Hindi months are derived from those of the Nakshatras. The evidence for this conclusion, from which I dissent, is given in the following list, to which I have added a column showing that the current Hindi vernacular names are either exactly the same as the classical names, or else manifestly dialectic, and therefore perhaps earlier forms of the later Sanskritized names:\n\n| Names of Months (Alberuni) | Current Vernacular Hindi Names | Names of Lunar Stations |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| 1.

It was perhaps made in solar-lunar times. At all events it does not represent the old lunar order of the months.\n10. \u015ar\u0101vana   Sr\u0101bon   20. \u015arava\u1e47a\n11.

Bharani\n\nFrom this list it is perfectly clear that the current Hindi names of the months and those of the lunar stations come from the same source. That the months were named before the lunar stations seems to me to be proved from the arguments detailed in the foregoing essay. The year was not fixed after the path of the moon through the heavens had been traced, but before. The Nakshatras were recorded after a long series of astronomical observations, which showed that the moon in her passage through the heavens in her annual course of twenty-six phases, or thirteen complete lunations, traversed certain constellations, half of which were named from the thirteen months which had been already found to complete the year. Therefore the original number of months must have been thirteen.\n\nAn examination of the above list of Nakshatras shows that there are three phases of the moon allotted to three months. Ph\u0101lguna, Bh\u0101drapad\u0101 (Bh\u0101don) and \u0100\u015bvayuga (Assin). Now as there are twenty-seven Nakshatras, one of the groups must be made three in number to give a place for the name of the leader, who, as I have suggested in p. 558, was to the Dravidians a necessary member of every organized body, and who must therefore have had a place among the Nakshatras when they became twenty-seven gods. The two extra phases given to the remaining two months must contain the thirteenth month. This, as I have tried to prove in p. 557, note 1, must have been originally inserted after or before Ph\u0101lguna (February), the place assigned to the Roman month Mereedonius, or else before or after Sr\u0101bon. This original arrangement may have been altered when the astronomical calendar of the Nakshatras took the final form,\nand when errors of time were corrected by intercalations. If this was ever done (which, as I have shown in the text, was doubtful), extra lunations must have been added when required to either the fifth or tenth month or to both. The only reason I mention this hypothesis is because it seems to suit the present arrangement of the calendar. But this intercalation could never have taken place till after the solar-lunar was substituted for the lunar calendar, and the apparently true explanation of the different places occupied by the phases of the thirteenth month seems to be that at one time the three months of generation occupied the first place, and at another the last place in the year. If this was the case, the first appears to be the older form, which, like the Roman year, made the year a complete \"annus\" or ring, containing within itself the annual series of mutual changes, while the second conception was the offspring of a wider circle of ideas, making each year the generator of that which was to follow.\n\nA further examination of the Nakshatras given in the above list shows that the first phase of the moon in each month is named after the month in all except three months. These are Pausha (Poos), M\u0101gha and \u0100\u015bvayuja (Assin). Now if the original thirteenth month had been one of the three at the beginning of the year, reckoning from the winter solstice, which occurred in Poos, it must have begun, as the other months did, in the phase answering its name, and the first three months must have been as follows:\n\n| Name of Month | Lunar Stations |\n|---------------|----------------|\n| 1. Paushya\u00b9   | 1. P\u016bshya      |\n| (Poos)        | 2. \u0100\u015blesha     |\n| 2. M\u0101gh       | 3. M\u0101gha       |\n|               | 4. Hasta       |\n| 3. Ph\u0101lguni   | 5. Purvaphalguni |\n|               | 6. Uttaraphalguni |\n\n\u00b9 This is clearly the god Pushan, who is spoken of in the Rig-Veda as \"drawn by goats,\" Muir, Sanskrit Texts, v. 12, p. 171; Rgv. vi. 55.4; Rgv. vi 57.3. He was, according to Sayana, Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, i. 2. 9, note 16, Haug's translation, vol. ii. pp. 20-21, a Sudra, or Non-Aryan deity. He and Soma (the moon) are the gods who give wealth and cattle, he is the tutelary god of travellers, and the clearer of\nThis arrangement would make Punarvasu, the fifth Nakshatra in Alberuni\u2019s list, the twenty-seventh, or the ruler of the year, and would leave it out of the reckoning of the thirteen months. As for the change in the place of Hasta, the later Hindoo astronomers probably placed this phase as they did with that of Abhijit, to be noticed afterwards, between the two Ph\u0101lguns, but its natural and original place is evidently that which I have assigned to it.\n\n| Name of Month | Lunar Station |\n|---------------|--------------|\n| 4.

This is evidently put in by the sun-worshippers to mark both the centre of the lunar year, between the thirteenth and fourteenth phases of the moon, and their own triumph over this system.\n\n|               | 15. \u015arava\u1e47a |\n|---------------|-------------|\n| 8. \u015arava\u1e47a (\u015ar\u0101bon) | 16.

I have not found any name for the thirteenth month which bears any resemblance to S\u0101tabhishaj, for those quoted in p. 532, note 2, from the V\u0101jasaney\u0101 Samhit\u0101 and the K\u0101\u1e6dhaka have no connection with it. I must therefore call the next month provisionally:\n\n|               | 17. S\u0101tabhishaj |\n|---------------|-----------------|\n| 9. S\u0101tabhishaj | 18. Revati |\n\npaths. Like the Greek Hermes, whom he resembles, he was a snake-god. In the Satapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, ii. 5, 4, 18, Eggeling\u2019s Translation, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xii. p. 418, he is represented as the earth, who gave up Vritra the snake-race to be slain by Indra. He is, in the passage, clearly the chief snake-god.\n\n\u00b9 Prinsep\u2019s Indian Antiquities, vol. ii. p. 150.\nRevati must have been originally in this place, for Asvini was evidently the phase that took its name from Assin.\n\n10.

Punarvasu\n\nIn this arrangement two points are to be especially noticed, the names Mrigasirsha and \u0100rdra, those of the 25th and 26th Nakshatras. Mrigasirsha means the \"deer-headed\" god, and is evidently the gazelle or, in India, the black antelope, which, as Dr. Sayce shows, was sacred to Mul-lil, the moon-god of Nipur, and which afterwards became the Zodiacial sign of Capricornus.\u00b9 The present name is evidently a Sanskrit translation of an Accad or Dravidian original, and the original name was, as I shall show presently, when speaking of the Tamil months, Marga or some very similar name. The second notable name, \u0100rdra, means the son of Rudra, which last was the name given to the Nakshatras in the solar-lunar calendar. This shows that probably Rudra originally represented the twenty-sixth Nakshatra, or the end of the lunar year.\n\nThe name Assin is probably derived from \u0100\u1e63va, the horse, and has no connection with the heavenly twins, Asvin, who were solar or rather solar-lunar deities. The names Asvin or Assin and Bharani seem to refer to the horse-owning tribes and the Bh\u0101rata, who, as I have shown in Part II. of this series of papers, played such an important part in the history of Northern India.\n\nThat the vernacular names of the Hindi months date from a very early period, long anterior to the introduction of the\n\n\u00b9 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 284.\nNakshatras and the still later solar-lunar calendar, is also proved by the names of the Tamil and Telugu months. The evidence of the Tamil months is especially valuable, as their names show some which are evidently of an earlier date than the Hindi vernacular names, while evidence is also given by the existence of another list of Tamil months, named after the signs of the Zodiac, which shows that these were a foreign and late importation.\n\nThe following is the list of names, beginning with the month Poos:\n\n| Tamil Lunar List | Tamil Solar-Lunar List | Telugu | Hindi Names |\n|------------------|------------------------|--------|-------------|\n| 1. Tai           | 1. Kumbha\u00b9 (The watering-pot) | 1. P\u016bshan | 1. Poos |\n| 2. Maussi        | 2. Minam (The fishes)    | 2. Magham | 2. M\u0101gh |\n| 3. Panguni       | 3.

Margasiram | 12. M\u0101rgasirsha or Aggaham |\n\n\u00b9 This was evidently connected with snake and linga worship. The watering-pot was the sacred water used to bathe the linga, which was represented in the Zodiac by the fishes, but which was originally the fish-god Ea, symbolized by the snake.\nThe above list of the Tamil months clearly shows that several of these names are the same as those of the Hindi months, but there are also others, Tai, Maussi, Auni, Audi, Auvani, and Purattasi, which are entirely different from the Hindi names. The question that first arises is as to whether the Tamil names which are like those in the Hindi list are derived from Hindi, or whether they both come from roots common to all the Dravidian-speaking tribes, who were the earliest snake and moon-worshippers. The name Kartikai seems to be exactly the same word as Kartik. Chittri and Pangumi are exactly the same words as Chait and Phalgun, while Phalgun appears to be closely connected with the Pongol, the name of the festival of the opening year. The Tamil name Pongol, as Dr. R. Rost has been good enough to inform me, means fermentation or \"furor,\" and is exceedingly applicable to the festival of the opening year, called Pongol, of the Tamils, and the Saturnalia of Rome. It typifies the \"furor\" which, according to the ancient generative theory, accompanied the act of creation, and which was celebrated in the festivals of the opening of the year, and in the great Huli festival of Phalgun, which is the women's festival, and which takes place in the month which appears from examination of the Nakshatra to be the third and last month of the generative series.\n\nBut the most important name in the Tamil list of months is Tai, which takes in the Tamil year the place of Poos. Tai in Tamil means the mother, and Pushan, the goat-drawn god, is the god who in the later revision of the calendar, made when the father became head of the family and substituted for Tai, the original mother. The Tamil year therefore points back to a period long before the patriarchal era, when the children belonged to the mother and not to the father, and when it was the mother that bore and generated the coming year. The occurrence of this name also makes it probable that the names of the other months were derived from Dravidian or Accadian roots, and simply continued in use with many other common vernacular words when the Dravidian and Kolarian-speaking tribes of Northern India adopted a dialect with Sanskrit\ninflections, under the teaching of Brahmin schoolmasters. The name Auvani also appears to be, like Tai, an old original name, while the Sanskritized Sr\u0101vana or Srabon simply means the glorious (srava) month. The name Bh\u0101drapad\u0101 is also apparently a Sanskrit name, meaning the beautiful footed, and seems, as I have suggested in p. 546, to refer to the connection between the fire god and the bull\u2019s foot, as the other name of the month, Prasthapada, means the ox-footed month.\\(^1\\) This last name bears a great likeness to that of the corresponding Athenian month Boedromion.\n\nThe second list of months called after the signs of the Zodiac is of course much later than that which gave names to the Nakshatra, but it also shows traces of a very early phase of sun-worship, as the sign of the Ram (Aries), which was adopted by all the people who have used the solar year since the Greeks and Romans first took the Zodiac from Assyria, is here represented by the goat. The goat was, as I have shown, an animal sacred to the moon, and the people who placed the goat among the signs of the Zodiac must have reverenced the moon as well as the sun, and must have lived before the people who substituted the Ram for the goat as the more distinctly solar animal.\n\n\\(^1\\) Journal of the American Oriental Society, vol. vi. art. iii.

Lenormant.\n\nWhether the division and classification of linguistic affinities will always remain such as are propounded at the present day, or whether in due course and as a result of further research, this arrangement will have to make way for other conclusions, is not the question intended to be discussed here. The object of this paper is merely an attempt to bring together some historical, geographical, and literary data based upon more recent investigations, referring chiefly to one single linguistic branch, namely, the Ugor division of the Ural-Altaic family of languages; to point out the habitat and numbers belonging to the various tribes classified under that head, and to bring down, as far as possible to our own day, the history of linguistic researches in that special field of study.\n\nThe geographical area occupied by the peoples so classified belongs, at the present time, to the European continent, with the exception of the Vogul and Ostjak, who have their homes on the eastern or Asiatic side of the Ural Mountains. But tradition, history, and certain linguistic and ethnic affinities point to a relationship of the Ugor with the Tatar-Mongol, and especially with the Turki branch of languages, if not peoples\u2014in short, with those whom Bishop Caldwell calls \"Scythian,\" and which, together with the Dravidian family, have been classed as Turanian. We shall point out more fully in due course the controversy on that\npoint still carried on by eminent philologists, one of several questions of no little moment which await a final decision from researches yet to be made by Oriental inquirers. Nor can any one be surprised at such being still the case. The true science of language and comparative philology is but of yesterday. Without desiring to overstep the limits of our theme, but making use of the old nomenclature, it may be pointed out, that the Indo-European family and the \"Scythian\" group are, according to Caldwell, brought into near contact through the Dravidian element, which seems to occupy a position midway between the two, though more nearly approaching the \"Scythian.\" Bishop Caldwell states also that the particulars of real relationship between the Ural-Altaic and the Dravidian are of so distinctive and so essential a nature, that they appear to him to amount to what is called a \"family likeness,\" and therefore naturally suggest the idea of common descent. This relationship seems to be not merely morphological, but in some shape or another \"genealogical,\" as section after section of Bishop Caldwell's book, that inexhaustible mine of most valuable information, amply testifies. The family of languages, he says, to which the Dravidian appear most nearly related, is the Finnish or Ugrian (Ugor). This supposition derives some confirmation from the fact brought to light by the Behistun tablets; that the \"Scythic\" race, by which the greater part of Central Asia was peopled prior to the Medo-Persians, belonged to the Ugrian stock. It is most remarkable that distinct affinities to the speech of the Dravidians should be discoverable in the language of the Finns in Northern Europe, and in that of the Ugrians in Siberia.\u00b9 Dr. Trumpp thought he had discovered traces of similar affinities in the languages of Northern India.\u00b2 Csoma de K\u00f6r\u00f6s found others in the Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit, and Louis Podhorszky\u00b3 wrote an etymological and comparative vocabulary of the Magyar and Chinese languages.

The principal ones being the Jakut in the north-east of Asia, the Uigur, and the Osmanli.\n4. The Samojed, in five different groups, and\n5. The Finn-Ugor (Ugric) or Ural languages.\n\nB. Friedrich M\u00fcller divides the Ural-Altaic languages thus:\n\n1. The Samojed dialects, namely, the Jurak, Tavgi, Ostjak, Samojed, Jenissei, and Kamasini.\n2. Finn, comprising four groups, viz.\n   a. The special Finn group, including the Suomi, the Est (Ehst, Eesti), the Liv, and the Lapp.\n   b. The Perm group, viz. the Syrjaen and the Votjak.\n   c. The Volga-Bulgar group, comprising the Cheremiss and the Mordvin (Mordva, in Russ).\n   d. The Ugor group contains the Ostjak, the Vogul, and the Magyar.\n3. The Turki or Tatar group:\n   a. The Jakut.\n   b. The Ugric, Jagatai, and Turkoman-Usbek.\n   c. The Nogai, Kumuk, and Chuvash.\n   d. Osmanli-Turkish.\n4. Mongol.\n5. Tungussic.\n\nC. Professor Budenz dissociates Lapp from Finn (Bezzenberger's Beitr\u00e4ge, iv. 1878), and says: \"The Finn in its general signification comprises the following languages: the Suomi, Est, Liv, Votjak, Lapp, Mordvin, Cheremiss, Syrjaen, Ostjak, Vogul, and the Magyar.\"\nThe specific or the Ugor proper group, Budenz divides into two sections:\n\na. The South Ugor section: the Cheremiss, the Mordvin, and the Finn.\n\nb. The North Ugor section includes the Lapp, the Votjak, the Syrjaen, the Ostjak, the Vogul, and the Magyar.\n\nD. Professor O. Donner\\(^1\\) adopts, after Prince L.-L. Bonaparte, the following arrangement:\n\nI. The Finn or Chudo-Volga-Perm group, with two subdivisions, namely,\n\n1. The West Finn-Volga subdivision, with the following languages: the Finn proper, the Vot, Karelian (almost extinct), the Veps, Est, Liv, Lapp, and the languages on the Volga, viz. the Mordvin and the Cheremiss.\n\n2. The Perm subdivision, comprising the Syrjaen, with the two closely related dialects, the Perm proper and the Votjak.\n\nIt should be stated here, that further researches will have to decide in how far the Cheremiss is more nearly related to this than to the preceding subdivision.\n\nII. The Ugor group consists of the Ostjak, the Vogul, and the Magyar.\n\nThe total number of individuals speaking languages classified under the Finn-Ugor family amounts, according to Prof. Donner's data, to about eleven and a quarter million souls, namely, the Finn and the Lapp group, 2,897,071; the Volga-Perm group, 1,837,292; the Ugor group, 6,514,945.\n\nWe shall follow Professor Donner, and the excellent map which accompanies the first number of the \"Journal de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Finno-Ougrienne,\" already mentioned. The map for this paper has been specially adapted to the Journal.\n\nI. The Finn or Chudo-Volga-Perm group.\n\n1. West Finn-Volga subdivision.\n\na. The Finn. The Finnish-speaking nationality occupies almost the whole territory of the dukedom of Finland and the adjoining country. Westward it extends a few miles beyond\n\n\\(^1\\) Journal de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Finno-Ougrienne, No. I. Helsingfors, 1886.\nthe river Tornio, and to the north in the Polar circle halfway between the rivers Lule\u00e5 and Kalis, as far as Karesuvanto. The Finn-speaking population of Finland in 1880 was 1,756,381 souls; and in Sweden 19,611, comprising the majority of the inhabitants of the parishes of lower Tornio, Karl Gustaf, Hjetaniem, Upper Tornio, Korpilombolo, and Pajala. In the district of Gellwaare we find 1934 Finns, 960 Lapps, and 628 Swedes; in Jukkasjarvi 1412 Finns and 558 Lapps; in Enontckis 377 Finns and 947 Lapps. In Wermland, southward, there is a small Finn population, descendants of a Finn colony which settled there about two hundred years ago. This people live on a narrow strip of land extending to thirty miles off the Warald lake, as far as the northern half of Norra Rogden, in the parishes of Bogen, Gr\u00e4smark, Lekvattnet, Ostmark, Hvitsand, Ny, and of Sodra Finnskoga. According to the official returns of 1880, there were in Wermland 780 Finns. Aminoff puts their number at 1708, and makes a return of 4000 Finn-speaking individuals settled on both sides of the frontier-line. He is of opinion that these Finns will in less than half a century be entirely absorbed by the dominant race, the Russian. In the south the Finns are gradually disappearing; but on the north they multiply considerably, so much so, that during the last forty years they have doubled in numbers. In 1875 the numerical proportion of the Finn population was 7\u00b77 in the province of Troms\u00f6, and 24\u00b72 in that of Finnmark.\n\nOn the eastern border of Finland towards Russia, long. 52\u00b0, we find a Karelo-Finn population, from which, two centuries ago, small colonies migrated into the provinces of Novgorod and Tver. There is here a Finn-speaking population of about 192,314 souls.\n\nPeople of Finn descent are also found in the provinces of St. Petersburg, Olonetz and Novgorod, altogether about 142,689 persons, known by the names of Ingris, Savakot, and \u00c4y\u00e4m\u00f6iset. They speak cognate dialects, derived from the Karelian or east Finn language, which is now nearly extinct.\n\nb. The Vot tribe, or, as Sj\u00f6gren calls them, the Chud of the south, inhabit a few villages under the Government of\nthe province of St. Petersburg, in the districts of Oranienbaum and Jamburg, and particularly in the parish of Kattila. K\u00f6ppen reckons their number at 5000 persons.\n\nc. The Veps tribe, according to Sj\u00f6gren, the Chud of the north, are settled on the south-west border of the lake Onega, at the outlet of the river Svir, in the vicinity of the town Petrosavodsk and in the parishes of Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi, Mundj\u00e4rvi, Sununsuu and Viidana. They are found in considerable numbers in the upper region of the river Ojat, extending as far as the western border of the river Bjelosoro.\n\nK\u00f6ppen gives their number at 16,000 souls. There are two dialects: the South Veps and the North Veps.\u00b9\n\nd. The Esth, Est, or Eesti tribe have their homesteads on the south of the Bay of Finland, namely, in Estland, Livland and on the islands of Dag\u00f6 and \u00d6sel. A few colonies of Est are found under the governments of Pskov, St. Petersburg and Vitebsk. The last census puts their number at 746,522 souls.\n\nTwo dialects are distinguished:\n\na. The Dorpat-Est or the Southern dialect, prevailing in the territories of the Governments of Dorpat, Fellin and Pernau.\n\n\u03b2. The Revel-Est or Northern dialect spoken in the Bay of Finland.\n\nThe first is the more ancient, and stands nearer to the Finn than the Northern dialect.\n\ne. The Liv tribe occupy the northernmost region of the promontory of Kurland around Domesn\u00e4s, extending for about 68 versts westward on the Bay of Riga. This is a small remnant of the old Liv tribe which at one time peopled a more extensive area. Some years ago this tribe numbered only 2541 individuals.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Journal Soc. Finno-Ougr. No. II. 1887.\n\u00b2 Prince L.-L. Bouaparte, in a letter dated July 1886, and addressed to Dr. Cust, says, \"The Livonian is Altaic. It is spoken in two dialects by about 2000 persons in the extreme northern corner of Kurland, viz. at Kolken and at Pisen. In Kurland then where Lettish is generally spoken, the Livonian alias Livese, and the Creviugian, are still more or less spoken.\"\n\nTo Dr. Cust the author of this paper is indebted for a great number of the sources of information kindly placed at his disposal.\nf. The Lapp tribe inhabits the most northerly parts of Europe along the border of the Polar Sea. In 1875 their number was found to be 15,718 individuals. Of these, 1073 were leading a nomad life. The greater part of the settled Lapp population is found in Norway, where the territory between the North Cape and Roraas is their home, especially in the province of Finnmark. As we proceed southward, their number diminishes, so much so, that in 1875 there were only 99 Lapps in the District of Naandal, 79 in Inderaen, 33 in Fosen, and only 13 in Guldal.\n\nOn the Swedish territory their number in 1880 was 7000, but they become less numerous as we proceed southward. In the northerly parishes, their neighbours are the Finns and Swedes; each nationality occupies a separate district. In the district of the Noorbotten there were counted 3854 individuals, in Westerbotten 1431, and in Jemtland, through which district the railway runs from Lundsvall to Trondhjem, there were 800 Lapps; whilst in the corresponding districts of South and North Trondhjem only 242 Lapps could be found. In Finland their number was about 600, scattered in the parishes of Ustjoki and Enareh. The Russian Lapps on the peninsula of Kola number only 6101 individuals. From the above data the Lapp population may be set down at 29,719.\u00b9\n\ng. Mordvin. Besides the tribes which inhabit the shores of the North Sea, the Mordvin are the nearest relatives of the Finns. Their habitat extends furthest south of all the Finn tribes, and they are also the most numerous among them. They occupy regions along the upper and lower course of the Sura, a tributary of the Volga; it is the territory between the rivers Oka and Volga, in the Governments of Nijni Novgorod, Simbirsk, Penza, Tambov, and Saratov. For ten centuries this tract of the country has been the home of the Mordvin. In the course of that time numerous colonies left the parent stock in search of other settlements on the east of the river Volga, and are now met with in the\n\n\u00b9 Four dialects are distinguished: a. The Norwegian Lapp; b. the Swedish Lapp; c. the Enareh Lapp; d. the Kola or Russ-Lapp.\nGovernments of Kazan, Samara, Ufa, Orenburg, and Astrakan. Ibn Foslan became acquainted with the Mordvin along the central course of the Volga.\n\nThere are two dialects:\n\n\u03b1. The Ersa, or the Northern dialect, spoken by the Mordvin under the Governments of Nijni Novgorod and Simbirsk.\n\n\u03b2. The Moksha, or southern dialect, spoken in the provinces of Penza, Tambov, and Saratov. According to the latest registers kept by the clergy, the population of the Northern Division (Ersa) amounts to 764,500, and that of the Southern (Moksha) to 384,300, altogether 1,148,000. Their communities are small and scattered, and are gradually losing nationality, owing to Russian influences.\n\n\u03b3. Cheremiss. To the north of the country of the Mordvin, and on the left border of the river Volga, live tribes belonging to the Cheremiss group. They form a connecting link between the Mordvin and Perm populations, both geographically and linguistically. The territory occupied by the Cheremiss extends from Kosmodemjansk in the west as far as Kazan, and in the south from the river Volga to the town of Jaransk, and beyond as far as the river Vyatka, a tributary of Kama, including the territory between the cities of Urzhum and Malmysh. The bulk of the Cheremiss people live here and are called the Cheremiss of the plains (meadows or woods), to distinguish them from their brethren the Cheremiss of the hills, each speaking a separate dialect. This latter is a small tribe on the south of the Volga, in the vicinity of the mouth of the river Sura. There is a third and a more populous Cheremiss tribe on the east, viz. between the rivers Ufa and Bjelaja, and on the borders of the river Dema, a tributary of the Ufa. The sum total of the Cheremiss population is put down at 259,745.\n\n2. The Perm subdivision comprises the Syrjaen, the Perm, and the Votjak dialects.\n\n\u03b1. The Syrjaen or Zir.\n\nThe habitat of the Syrjaen tribe, properly so called, is situated chiefly in the territory subject to the Government\nof Vologda, in the districts of Ustsysolsk and Jarensk.\\footnote{Between N. Lat. $59^\\circ$-$65^\\circ$ and E. Long. $63^\\circ$-$77^\\circ$.} For centuries the district of Jarensk was said to have been inhabited entirely by Syrjaen population; but in the present day we must travel about 15 miles east of the principal town of the district before encountering the first Syrjaen village. In the district of Mczen, Government of Archangel, are met a few Syrjaen families, whose chief occupation is breeding reindeer on the borders of Ishma, a tributary of the river Pechora.\n\nWiedemann recognizes seven Syrjaen subdialects, and names them thus:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item \\textit{a. Sysolian}, spoken on the borders of Sysola.\n  \\item \\textit{b. Lusian}, on the river Lusa.\n  \\item \\textit{\u03b3. Pechorian}, on the borders of Pechora.\n  \\item \\textit{\u03b4. Vychegdian}, on the borders of Vychegda river, the most extended dialect, being spoken by about 27,000 persons.\n  \\item \\textit{\u03b5. The Udorian dialect}, \u03be. the Ishemian, and \u03b7. the Permian, according to the geographical position in which they are respectively found.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAccording to the latest data the number of Syrjaen-speaking population amounts to 85,432, the greater portion of which, namely, 72,632 persons, live in the province government of Vologda. In the vernacular it is called the Ud-Murt country.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item \\textit{b. The Permian dialect} is spoken by a tribe more scattered than the Syrjaen. This people live in the governments of Perm and Vjatka, they call themselves Komi-murt, meaning the people of the river Kama; the neighbouring Vogul call them Sarakum. Professor Donner puts down their number at 67,317 souls.\n  \\item \\textit{c. The Votjak dialect} of the Perm subdivision of the Finn or Chudo-Volga-Perm group.\n\nThe people belonging to this group call themselves \\textit{Udmurt}, and live in the province of Vjatka, particularly in the districts of Jelabuga, Malmysh, Glazov, Sarapul, and Slobodsk. Scattered Votjak colonies are found also in the provinces of Kazan, Perm, Samara, and Ufa.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe Votjak, like the Perm, live mostly in small clusters surrounded by Russians, and reckon among their neighbours tribes speaking Tatar, Cheremiss, and Chuvash languages, from all of whom they have borrowed many words. In number the Votjak make up more than the entire half of the Bjarmian (Permian) population, notwithstanding that their territory is much smaller. The Votjak speak several dialects, insufficiently known as yet to philologists.\n\nThe population in 1872 was reckoned at 276,000. Of these there were under the Governments of Vjatka, 262,073; Kazan, 8262; Perm, 2593; Samara, 1357; Ufa, about 1715.\n\nII. The Ugor or Ugric Group.\n\nThe primitive home of the Ugor group is the extensive country situated on both sides of the rivers Ob and Irtish, at the present day still occupied by the Vogul and Ostjak tribes, who in their vernacular go by the name of Man-\u010di. The Syrjaen call this country J\u00f6gra, plural J\u00f6gra-jas. The words Hungaria, Ungarn, Hongrie seem to be connected with that ancient name.\n\nIn the Ugor group three subdivisions are noted, namely, 1. the Vogul, 2. the Ostjak, and 3. the Magyar.\n\n1. The Vogul.\n\nThe least numerous of all the Finn-Ugor tribes, except the Liv, inhabit the slopes on both sides of the Ural Mountains, and are subject to the governments of Perm and Tobolsk, occupying the vicinity of the rivers Sosva, Konda, and Tavda. Their occupation is hunting and fishing; intellectually they stand on the same level as the Lapp, and they are disappearing fast.\n\nThe number of the entire tribe according to the last data was only 6558, speaking three dialects, distinguished (according to the regions they occupy on the borders of the three rivers already mentioned) as the Sosra, Konda, and Tavda Vogul dialects, or the Pelim-Vogul, the Konda-Vogul, and the North-Vogul.\n2. Ostjak.\n\nIn the country bordering on the middle and lower part of the course of the river Ob, and extending furthest eastward, and also in the region of the river Irtish, are found the homesteads of the Ostjak. As regard civilization, they stand on the same level as the Vogul whom they surround on the east and north. In the neighbourhood of Konda, as far as the borders of the Irtish, Ostjak people are found. On the north and north-east is the Samoyed country, beyond that and on the south are the Turki tribes and the Russ.\n\nThe Ostjak's chief occupation during the summer is fishing, and during the winter hunting; some are devoted to breeding cattle, and a few cultivate the land. K\u00f6ppen estimates the whole tribe at 18,840 individuals; later returns make it 23,000. Three thousand Ostjak live under the government of Tomsk, but the bulk of the tribe is found in the province of Tobolsk. These are the\n\nA. Ugor-Ostjak, speaking two different dialects, namely:\n   a. The Surgit, on the upper region of the river Ob, and\n   b. The North Ostjak dialect on the lower Ob, commencing from the point where the Irtish and the Ob join the territory of the Samoyed, north of Obdorsk.\n\nB. On the river Jenissei live the Jenissei-Ostjak, whose language differs from that of the Ugor-Ostjak. Three dialects can be distinguished, namely, the Kondinsk, the Berezov, and the Obdorsk dialects, in the vicinity of the rivers so named.\n\nIn former times all the people living near the Sosva and Konda were designated by a common nomenclature, namely, the Ostjak. It was owing probably to the fact that there is no natural boundary between the Vogul and the Ostjak that both tribes went by the name of Jugra, Ugor, etc., and that they call themselves by a common vernacular name Manj-si or Manj-\u010di. This name is evidently derived from the river Manj or Manj-ja, the end syllable si or \u010di means 'people,' therefore Manj-people. Ur, Our, Vuor means 'forest,' hence Uro-\u010di\u2014'people of the forest, wild people,'\naccording to a Vogul story. By the Syrjaen tribe the river Manj is called Vogul. It is manifest, therefore, that the words Manj-\u010di and Vogul refer to the same river, the Manj. There is a well-known tradition that the people beyond the Ural, namely, the Ostjak and the Vogul tribes, came anciently from the vicinity of these rivers. The derivation of the word Ostjak is interesting. As means a great river, namely, the Ob; jah means a tribe or people, ergo As-jah, is the people of the Ob. From the word As-jah came the Russianized name Ostjak.\n\n3. Magyar or Hungarian.\n\nMention has already been made of the controversy still carried on with considerable tenacity by distinguished Oriental scholars of Hungary, namely, by Professors Paul Hunfalvy and Joseph Budenz on the one hand, and by Professor Armenius V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry on the other, regarding the true origin and the ancient home of the Magyar nation and its linguistic affinities. Professor V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry rejects the purely Finn-Ugor relationship on several grounds. From the point of ethnology he declines to admit that tribes of hunters and fishermen could ever be progenitors of a conquering race, such as the Turko-Tatars; while as to the language, there occur double consonants at the commencement of the words of some Finn-Ugor dialects, sounds altogether repugnant to Hungarian. Moreover, some of these languages possess the dual number, quite unknown to Magyar. V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry's conclusion is, therefore, that the Hungarian is a mixed language, claiming affinity with the Finn-Ugor, as well as with the Turko-Tatar families. So much is certain however, that there were some savants who, several centuries ago, had declared that the languages of the Vogul and of the Ostjak tribes sprang from a common stock with that of the Hungarians. According to those authorities the Hungarians\n\n1 A Magyarok Eredete, 1st edit. p. 230.\n2 Die Ungern. von Paul Hunfalvy. Wien und Teschen, 1881; Prof. P. Hunfalvy: The Regions of the Ural and their Inhabitants, Trans. Hungarian Geogr. Soc. vol. xvi. part iii. 1888; see also Ungarische Revue, 1888.\ncame from Jugria or Jogria. This opinion was subsequently adopted by almost every philologist and historian. Some authors went so far as to say that all the tribes in the vicinity of the Volga should be added to this group. What nobody seems to have called seriously in question is a philological affinity between the Manj-\u010di (Vogul and Ostjak) and the Magyar languages, notwithstanding that whilst the Magyar tongue of the present day possesses all the requirements and many-sidedness of a highly-cultured European language, that of the nomads remains in the lowest stage of philological development, and is, in some cases, becoming gradually extinct. According to the census of 1880, there were in Hungary proper 6,403,607; in Croatia 36,857; on the Turkish borderland 4563; and in Fiume on the Adriatic 383; making a grand total of 6,445,487 of Magyar population. Beyond the borders of Hungary there are Magyar colonies in Moldavia (Rumania) and Bukovina, the so-called Csang\u00f3-Magyar people, amounting to about 30,000 individuals. Altogether the Magyar race make up, in round numbers, six and a half million souls. If therefore we add to this number all the tribes classed under the Finn-Ugor linguistic family, we shall find that there are the Finn on the Baltic, including the Lapp; those of the Volga-Perm group, and the Manj-\u010di on the Ural, making up in all the eleven and a quarter millions belonging to the Finn-Ugor branch of the Ural-Altaic family.\n\nThe Hungarians therefore are the most numerous and important nation of the linguistic family classified under the Ugor branch of the Ural-Altaic division, not merely on account of their number and the extent of continuous territory occupied by them in Central Europe, but also owing to the influence they wield as a political factor among the European nations. They possess a literature on a level with other European languages; the impetus given to national life after the restoration of the ancient constitution, twenty-three years ago, may be judged by the fact, that whilst in 1850, the year following the intervention of Russia in Hungary, there were not more than nine Hungarian journals and periodicals,\nin January, 1889, they reached the enormous proportionate number of six hundred, giving, according to Professor Joseph Szinnyei, one publication to every 10,275 Hungarian-speaking individuals. By way of comparison: in Great Britain there are said to be 2177 such publications, showing a proportion of one to 16,188 inhabitants.\\(^1\\) Relying on the sources of information furnished by Hungarian philologists, almost all of whom are members of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Budapest, a short review of the conclusions arrived at is herewith presented to the reader, accompanied by a short account of some of the efforts made by men of science during past centuries, whose aim was to solve the question of the origin of the Hungarian ancestors and the discovery of their ancient home, the memory of whom lives in a legendary form to the present day. The belief is that they were brought to Europe by successive waves of the migration of nations from countries lying far in the interior of Asia, perhaps its most northern parts.\n\nBesides the names mentioned in the course of this Essay, those in recent times, of Csoma de K\u00f6r\u00f6s,\\(^2\\) Jerney,\\(^3\\) V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry,\\(^4\\) Berzenczey,\\(^5\\) and B\u00e1lint,\\(^6\\) will readily suggest themselves. They all have been animated in their arduous researches by the same impulse. The last on this list, Gabriel B\u00e1lint, a linguistic genius, full of enthusiasm, not unlike his Sz\u00e9kely clansman, Csoma de K\u00f6r\u00f6s, proposed and followed up in 1873 and 1874 the plan of reaching Urga in Northern Mongolia. He did so by way of Ekaterinburg, Tumen and Krasnoyarsk in Western Siberia. Thence, travelling eastward, through Irkutsk and Kiakhta to Urga. Here he was busy with acquiring the Mongol language.

Some time after his return from Northern Mongolia, B\u00e1lint was invited to join Count Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi's famous scientific expedition into China in 1877; ill health compelled B\u00e1lint's return from Shanghai. The disappointment was most keenly felt, as B\u00e1lint had now hoped to become familiar with the Southern Mongol dialects as well. One of his companions, Louis L\u00f3ezy, speaks of B\u00e1lint's enthusiasm at the prospect of his long-cherished hope being realized, when he should be placed in the position of discovering the ethnographic relationship of his people with the Mongol, and of proving afterwards a close linguistic affinity between the Ugor and the Dravidian languages. On this topic B\u00e1lint wrote an Essay for Count Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi's work.\u00b9\n\nEnumeration of historical details as to the occupation by the Romans of the territories Dacia and Pannonia from A.D. 107\u2013430, at present under the sovereignty of the Crown of St. Stephen, is beyond our scope. We shall commence with the period when the Hungarians, pressing from the north-east upon the Moravian kingdom, gave a final blow to the dominion of King Sviatopolk's heirs by defeating the Moravian host and its allies the Bavarians, in 907 A.D. In that year the victors became masters of the ancient kingdom of the Avar, as far as the river Ems. This refers to what is at present the north-western part of Hungary, next to the Archduchy of Austria. As to what happened at that time in the south-east and north-east of Pannonia is veiled in obscurity. We hear of the Bulgar becoming the subjects of Bajan, the Khan of the Avar,\u00b2 about the middle of the sixth century A.D.; but a century later Kuvrat, the Prince of the Eastern Bulgars, rose in rebellion against the Khagan of the\n\n\u00b9 Jakab Elek: T\u00f6rt.

The exploits of Kuvrat\u2019s five sons are described by Theophanes, the Greek historian.\n\nThe German author Johann Christian von Engel, \u201cGeschichte des alten Pannoniens u. der Bulgaren,\u201d Halle, 1797, pp. 263\u2013314, offers a different narrative, suggesting that there had been an ancient Bulgar kingdom in the vicinity of the river Theisz. He speaks of Krumus, a prince of the Thracian Bulgar tribe. This account, however, is founded on no data to be verified from ancient authorities.\n\nAnother people mentioned by Engel are the Wallach. They appeared on the east of the river Theisz, in ancient Dacia. Several historians, among them Gibbon and Amad\u00e9e Thierry, have assumed that as early as the days of Trajan Roman civilization obtained a footing among them, and continued to flourish till the irruptions of the Hungarians. At the present day the Rumanian authors maintain that their ancestors enjoyed a separate national existence, notwithstanding the encroachments of Goths, Huns, Gepides, and of the Avar tribes, and even that a hierarchy of the Christian Church had been established among them. All these assumptions, however, must be subjected to further critical investigation and inquiry.\n\nAnother tribe mentioned by the ancient chroniclers, settled in the easternmost corner of Dacia, are the Sz\u00e9kely, said to be the remnants of Attila\u2019s warriors; but authentic historical sources know nothing of Bulgaria on the river Theisz, nor do they of the country of the Rumanian ancestors, or the Sz\u00e9kely. It may therefore be stated that up to the ninth century of the Christian era nothing certain is known of the history of the country lying between the Danube and the Theisz, nor of Transylvania.\n\nWe come to a safer ground when led by the light which the Arab authors throw upon the history of the populations living on the river Volga, namely, the Khazar and the Bulgar.\n\n---\n\n1 Wallachische Sprache hat viele lateinische Worte, aber bei weitem die gr\u00f6\u00dfere H\u00e4lfte nebst der ganzen Grammatik ist aus einer unbekannten Sprache, die vermutlich die alte Bulgarische ist.

The Scandinavian and Russ tribes became formidable to Byzantine subjects, and also the Arabs. These northern tribes inhabited an island covered with forest, were ignorant of agriculture, living on rapine obtained from the Slav, and were known as seafarers, pirates and robbers. Their captives were sold to the Bulgar and Khazar traders. These occurrences took place before the time of Ibn Dustah, and he must have heard of their exploits from other sources. About 900 A.D. the Russ formed an organized state around Kiew.\n\nAs to the Bulgar, Ibn Dustah relates that their country was adjacent to the land of the Burtasses, that they resided on the borders of the river Itil (the Volga), and that this river crossed the country of the Slav, the Bulgar, and the Khazar tribes. The Bulgar were subdivided into three sections, the Berzul, the Essegel and the Bulgar, properly so-called. The Khazar and the Russ traded with them, especially in furs. The Bulgar were agriculturists, growing wheat, barley, and pulse. The majority of them had become Muhammadans, mosques and schools being conspicuous in their villages. Those who still remained pagan worshipped all sorts of objects.\n\nRespecting Hungarians Ibn Dustah states: \"Between the country of the Pecheneg and the Essegel-Bulgar we first come upon the territory of the Ma\u017ear \\((\\text{\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u0632})\\), a Turkish tribe. Their prince brings 20,000 cavalry on to the battle-field, the Khazar chief only half that number. The Ma\u017ear prince is called Kende \\((\\text{\u0643\u0646\u062f})\\), a name signifying 'dignity,' his proper name being Jile \\((\u062c\u0644\u064a\u0647)\\).

On one side it reaches as far as the Sea of Rum (the Black Sea), into which flow two great rivers. The larger of the two is called J\u0113hun \u062c\u064a\u0647\u0648\u0646 Dnieper (the smaller being the Dniester). In the vicinity of these two rivers live the Ma\u017ear. When winter sets in, they come close to the river, and live by fishing during the cold season. The country is rich in forests and rivers, the soil is swampy, but there is an abundance of fields producing wheat. As to religion, they are idolaters. They rule over all the neighbouring Slavs, impose heavy requisitions on them, and treat them like captives in war. Sometimes the Ma\u017ears make a raid on the Slav tribes, and carry their captives to a port in the Black Sea, and barter them there to Greek merchants for velvet, carpets, and other merchandize.\" The name \"Ma\u017ear\" has not been found before Ibn Dustah, who believes them to be a Turkish tribe. Considering, however, that our historian was not personally acquainted with this people, he probably obtained his information, says Hunfalvy, from the Khazar or the Bulgar tribes. The more ancient Byzantine authors, when speaking of the Ma\u017ear, Magyar, apply the name \"Turk\" as well as Ugor and Unger. In the twelfth century A.D. they spoke of the Magyars as the Huns. The usual occupation of the Magyar race, when away from the battle-field, was hunting, fishing, and cattle-breeding.\n\nRegino, the Abbot of Pr\u00fcm, writes thus in 889: \"A hitherto unknown and dreadfully wild people, the 'Unger,' pressed by the Pecheneg, came from Skythia, and made repeated incursions into the territories of the Carinthian, Moravian, and Bulgar populations.\"\n\nConstantinos Porphyrogenitos knew that the original home of the Pecheneg lay between the rivers Atel (Volga) and Geich (the river Ural since Catherine II.). We noticed that Ibn Dustah places the Magyar homesteads between the Pecheneg on one side and the Essegel-Bulgar on the other. Constantinos mentions the name \"Ma\u017ear\" once, describes the first Magyar country under the name of\nLebedia, and the two rivers therein he calls Khidmas and Khingylos, and adds, \"this tribe are Turks.\" He further remarks that \"the Pecheneg drove the Unger (the Magyar, the Hungarians) from Lebedia, who thereupon divided into two sections; the first migrated eastward towards Persia, and was called Savartoiasphaloi,\\(^1\\) the second went westward towards the territory called Atelkuzu.\"\n\nConstantinos mentions the rivers Brutus and Scretus, which names in our day evidently stand for Pruth and Seret, and here it was, according to the statement of Constantinos, that the Hungarians first organized a state, by electing Arp\u00e1d, the son of Salmutes (Almus), to be a hereditary prince. After this event, and as soon as they settled in the kingdom, which to this day goes by their name (Magyar-Orsz\u00e1g, the country of the Magyar=Hungary), they were no longer molested by their old foes and eastern neighbours, the Pecheneg; because the Hungarians acquired strength, whilst the power of the former, in their unorganized condition, gradually diminished.\n\nIn the Chronicles of Leo Grammaticus (A.D. 1010), following the authority of the more ancient Byzantine authors, we find the Hungarian nation indifferently mentioned as \"Unger,\" \"Turk,\" and \"Hun,\" a circumstance worthy of particular notice from the standpoint of ethnology.\n\nHistorical data, however, as to conditions and wanderings of any tribe, before it became a settled nation, are matters of much uncertainty. In the case of the Hungarians we can hardly go with safety beyond the year 836 of the Christian era. No wonder, therefore, that the Hungarians never, even to the present day, ceased to be inspired by the patriotic desire of solving conclusively the question as to whence came their ancestors and who were their nearest kin?\n\nArminius V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry maintains and thoroughly discusses the subject in his important work \"The Origin of the Hungarians,\" and declares that although the Magyar language belongs to the Ural-Altaic family, yet the people, both as to language\n\n\\(^1\\) Zeusz, Johann G., Die Deutschen und die Nachbarst\u00e4mme. M\u00fcnchen, 1837, p. 49.\nand ethnology, should more properly be classed with the Turko-Tatar group. His theory is far more popular than that of Professor Hunfalvy, who, on the other hand, brings forward data to prove that the origin of the Magyar race and their first home must be sought in the vicinity of the present Vogul country.\n\nIt is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the merits of this controversy. It will suffice merely to mention the existence of the two schools. In course of time it may turn out that, speaking from a strictly scientific point of view, there is probably less divergence in the two theories than at present would appear, especially if, as a result of further research, the near linguistic alliance, suggested by Bishop Caldwell (op. cit. p. 71), between the Dravidian and the Finn-Ugor families, be more clearly elucidated, a problem evidently of intense importance to Budapest.\u00b9\n\nM. Hovelacque\u2019s words may be appropriately cited here, when he says, in comparing and classifying the Ugro-Altaic languages, \u201cIt would be improper to declare that nations speaking languages so classified must therefore have had ethnologically a common parentage.\u201d\u00b2 This matter seems to claim some general interest still. We propose therefore to follow Professor Hunfalvy,\u00b3 in giving a short sketch of the researches hitherto accomplished on the field of Ugor philology, noticing particularly the more recent labours of Hungarian philologists.\n\nIf we go back to the commencement of the sixteenth century, we find that Baron Sigismund Herberstein between 1516-1529 visited Russia in the capacity of Ambassador to the Grand-Duke of Moscow from two German Emperors, viz. Maximilian and Charles the Fifth. Herberstein, in his special position as a diplomatist, was acquainted with several European Courts, especially with that of King Ladislaus of\n\n\u00b9 Prof. Terrien de Lacouperie, in the preceding number of this Journal, \u201cOn the Djurtehen of Mandshuria,\u201d gives interesting references to the Ugro-Altaic languages.\n\u00b2 Abel Hovelacque, Biblioth\u00e8que des Sciences, etc., p. 345.\n\u00b3 i.

Herberstein knew the Slavonic languages, and was therefore able to collect much information in Russia, which he published in a book printed at B\u00e2le in 1556.\u00b9\n\nMaking use of a Russian manuscript, the author describes countries in the vicinity of the river Pechora, on the north of the Ural Mountains and on the river Ob. Following the course of the Pechora upwards, he describes it as far as the river Usa, of which the Pechora forms a branch, the Usa again being a branch of the river Shugora. Crossing the Ural Mountains Herberstein speaks of the region of the river Sibut (?) and follows the route to the fortress of Lepin, thence to the river Sosva, in the environs of which were found settlements of the Vogul tribe. Along the river Ob were situated the Vogul and Ugor homesteads\u2014Vogulici et Ugritzshi\u2014extending as far as the mouth of the river Irtish, into which the river Sosva flows. Two fortresses, the Jerom and the Tiumen, are described, belonging to the Jugur chiefs, who were tributaries to the Grand-Duke of Moscow. The Ural chain of mountains Herberstein calls \u201ccingulum mundi,\u201d the world\u2019s belt. This, according to him, was the situation of Juharia, the primitive home of the Hungarians, who, under Attila, had been devastating many kingdoms in Europe, had conquered \u201cPannonia,\u201d and had in due course changed its name into \u201cHungaria.\u201d This author further relates from hearsay that the Ugors or Jugurs of his day spoke the same language as the Magyar of Hungary; but he adds, \u201cWhether that be true or not, I cannot verify the fact, because, notwithstanding all my endeavours, I was unable to meet a native of that country, the Juharia, with whom my servant, a native of Hungary, could have spoken the language.\u201d\n\nHerberstein\u2019s geographical data as to the Vogul country seem to be fairly correct, which is not surprising when we consider that only a short time before, namely, in 1499 and 1500, Ivan Vasiljevich III. had planned his third expedition against the \u201cYuigurs\u201d (Jugurs), and subdued their princes. After this conquest the country of the \u201cYuigur\u201d and its bound-\n\n\u00b9 Rerum Moscovitarum Commentarii Sigismundi Lib. Baronis in Herberstein. Neyperg et G\u00f6ttenburg. Basilic\u00e6 1556. Second Edition.\naries were never spoken of till Lehrberg,\\(^1\\) at the beginning of the present century, through his researches, again examined and brought to notice the ancient half-forgotten data.\n\nBut how did Herberstein come to the conclusion, asks Hunfalvy, that this was the primitive home of the Hungarians, from which they emerged as conquerors of other tribes? The answer will become manifest as we proceed.\n\nThe next author whose work we have to notice is Philipp Johann Strahlenberg, a Swedish officer, who, after the battle of Pultava on the 8th July, 1709, fell into Russian hands, and continued for 13 years a prisoner of war. During this period he saw a good deal of Russia, having been permitted to travel in the interior of the country; he sojourned in Siberia also, and was the first philologist who compiled a vocabulary of Siberian languages; there is an attempt at a linguistic classification made by him of the different tribes of that country, among whom he mentions the Vogul also, whose heathen festivals and sacrificial rites he personally witnessed. What he saw and learnt during his stay among the Ostjak, Samojed, Jakut, Tatar, Turki, and Mongol tribes, he endeavoured to verify from other sources and by statements of former authors. In 1715, Strahlenberg compiled a map of Siberia; but the Governor, Prince Gagarin, laid hands on it, because the Russian Government of that day did not approve of foreigners possessing any information in such matters. Prior to the year 1723, the author had finished his work and sent it to Europe, but it was not printed till after Strahlenberg\u2019s final release from Russia. The very long title-page of this book, written in German, is explanatory of its contents, namely: \u201cA description of the Northern and Eastern part of Europe and Asia, in so far as it comprises the whole of the Russian Empire, including Siberia and the great Tartar-land, giving a historical and geographical sketch of old and new eras and much other hitherto unknown information, with a \u2018Tabula Polyglotta\u2019 of thirty-two different Tatar dialects never hitherto brought to light. To this is added, a Voca-\n\n\\(^1\\) Untersuchungen zur Erl\u00e4uterung der \u00e4ltesten Geschichte Russlands. Von A. C. Lehrberg.

Published at Stockholm for the author, 1730.\"\n\nStrahlenberg is probably the first philologist who endeavoured to furnish a comparative vocabulary of Siberian languages, and made an attempt at classification. At page 31 of his work the author speaks thus:\n\n\"If I am to express any opinion regarding what are called the Tatar people, we have to assume that in the north-east of Europe and Asia, there are six principal tribes, all of whom are known among Europeans by the generic name of Tatar. These six classes are as follows:\n\n1. The Ujgur.\n2. The Turki-Tatar, viz. the Bashkir, Kirgiz, Turki, Jakut, Chuvash.\n3. The Samoyed.\n4. The Mongol-Manchu.\n5. The Tunguss.\n6. The several tribes living between the Black and the Caspian Seas.\n\n\"To the first or the Ujgur class belong the Mordvin, Cherenniss, Permian and Votjak, all on the European side, and the Vogul, the Ostjak, and the Barabai' people on the Asiatic side. All these various tribes, conjointly with the Finn, Lapp, Est, Magyar-Sz\u00e9kely, and the small remnant of the Liv, belonged to one nation, to which are to be reckoned the Hun or Un, which, however, like all those of the Ujgur class, were not Tatar. The appellation hun, is not a proper, but a generic name, etc.\"\n\nThat these tribes really belonged originally to one nation this author endeavours to establish by the similarity of the names of the numerals, which he thinks are the best proof. He furnishes a polyglott table \"gentium boreo-orientalium\n\n---\n\n1 Baraba was called the extensive plain between the Ob and the Irtish, stretching from west to east. This Tatar name has been given to the watershed, called Great-Bar\u00e1ba.

Not many years before the publication of Strahlenberg\u2019s work, a countryman of his, Olave Rudbeck, wrote on the analogy of Gothie and Chinese languages, as well as on the similarity between the Finn and the Hungarian, and states as follows: \u201cI find the Magyar and the Finn languages standing so near to each other that we may indeed\n\n---\n\n1 Olavi Rudbeckii, Specimen usus linguae Gothicae in erudendis atque illustrandis obscurissimis quibusdam Sacri\u00e6 Scriptura locis; addita Analogia linguae Gothicae cum Sinica, nec non Finnic\u00e6 cum Ungarica. Upsalis, 1717.\nlook upon them as cognate.\" To establish his conclusion, Rudbeck adduces words of both languages for the sake of comparison.\n\nStrahlenberg mentions the name Sz\u00e9kely instead of Magyar, in that he seems to have followed a Hungarian writer Matthias B\u00e9l de Vetze, who in a work entitled \"Litteratura Hunno-Scythica,\" Lipsiae, 1718, endeavoured to prove that there was, at one time, a Hun-Scythian alphabet, which he thinks must have been known to the Sz\u00e9kely, because they, according to this author's opinion, were the direct descendants of the Huns. B\u00e9l, moreover, was most enthusiastic in his effort to prove that the Hungarian was a direct descendant from the Hun.\n\nDuring his journeys through Russia, Strahlenberg met with another scientific traveller, Messersehmldt, from whose diary Klaproth makes extracts. He explored the regions about the river Jenissei in 1723, and the next two years he spent among the Vogul and Ostjak tribes, where he made a collection of words, quoted by Klaproth. The next author, Johann Eberhardt Fischer, published a work, \"Siberische Geschichte,\" St. Petersburg, 1768, containing important information on the Vogul; on it is based chiefly all that Schloezer narrates respecting the peoples and countries of Northern Asia. Fischer is the author of several other works; the following three refer especially to our subject: his History of Siberia is the continuation of a work begun in 1737 by Gerhard Friedrich M\u00fcller. It gives the history from the discovery of Siberia to its conquest by Russia. In the preface to his work Fischer speaks thus: \"The Vogul live on both sides of the Jugor Mountains (the Ural), in the vicinity of the Irtis and Ob (which flow into the Frozen Sea), and also on the borders of rivers which fall into the Kama and Volga, and consequently into the Caspian Sea.\" \"The language of the Vogul,\" says Fischer, \"resembles that of the Ostjak, who dwell near the Irtis and the Ob; it is understood by the Esth, Finn, Lapp, Surjaen, Perm, Votjak,\n\n1 A Hungarian writer, see infra.\nCheremiss, Mordvin, and the Chuvas.\u201d He further mentions that there exist a great many words in these dialects which agree with that of the Magyar; \u201cand here the question arises,\u201d says Fischer, \u201care the Magyar related to the Vogul or not? We know from Russian authorities that in the ninth century A.D. the Ugor or Jugur people migrated from the north, passed Kiev, and continued their journey across the Karpathian mountains. Here they subdued the inhabitants, viz. the Wallachians, and occupied the territory of the Danube, calling this newly-conquered country after themselves. It is therefore quite possible that the ancient Jugurs were the ancestors of the Magyars, the Hungarians of to-day.\u201d With this Russian account agree many German and Hungarian authors, who aver that the Magyar were expelled from their original home, as stated above, by the Pecheneg, and afterwards settled in Pannonia. In the ninth century some Pecheneg were still to be met in the vicinity of the river Jaik (the river Ural), the very spot therefore which the Ugor (Magyar) are said to have occupied before them. The river Jaik comes from the Ural Mountains, of which the slopes of Jugoria, the present Vogul country, form a part. The distance between the Jugor and Vogul is not very great; if therefore the Jugor or Ugor in question were the ancestors of the Magyar, the deduction is conclusive that the Vogul of to-day had a common ancestral origin with the Magyar (Hunfalvy).\n\nThe travellers de Plano Carpin and Rubruquis early in the thirteenth century give the name of Basart or Paskatir to the ancient country of the Hungarians, near the river Jaik. The word Basart is analogous to Madsar = Magyar, by interchange of the letters b and m. The fact that the people named Ugor call themselves Magyar (Madsar) need offer no insuperable difficulty, since history furnishes other similar examples. Fischer moreover states that half of the common Chud and Vogul words sound like Hungarian, and mentions especially the numerals. A good many Tatar and Persian words also occur in Hungarian, such as: \u2018ten\u2019 \u062f\u0633 Hung. t\u00edz; \u2018one hundred\u2019 \u0633\u0648 Hung. sz\u00e1z; \u2018God\u2019 \u064a\u0632\u062f\u0627\u0646 Hung. isten, etc. This may\ntend to show that the ancient Jugors lived in the neighbourhood of the Persians, and that the religion of the Magi may have had some influence on them. Fischer's object was to trace an affinity between the Magyar and the Vogul. \"I have in my possession,\" he says, \"a collection of 300 words gathered from forty different languages of Siberia, and I know scarcely one Hungarian word which, as to its sound, is not similar to that of the Vogul and Chud languages.\"\n\nHere follows Fischer's paradigm of six languages in his orthography, except the Magyar words, of which the orthography has been emended:\n\n| Magyar | Vogul | Irtish Ostjak | Votjak | Cheremiss | Finn |\n|--------|-------|--------------|--------|-----------|------|\n| 1 egy  | aku   | ejet         | odik   | iktat     | yhte |\n| 2 kett\u0151| kiteg  | katu         | k\u00fck    | koktat    | kahte|\n| 3 h\u00e1rom| kurom  | khulom       | kviu   | kummut    | kolme|\n| 4 n\u00e9gy | nille  | nilha        | nill   | nillet    | nelj\u00e4|\n| 5 \u00f6t   | at     | uv\u00e4t         | vit    | viset     | viite|\n| 6 hat  | kot    | koth         | kvat   | kudat     | knute|\n| 7 h\u00e9t  | s\u00e1t    | sabat (labat?) | sizim | \u0161imet     | seitsem\u00e4n|\n| 8 ny\u00f3lez | nol-lou | nilha      | kikjamas | kanda\u0161 | kahdeksan|\n| 9 kienez | ontol-lou | artjan    | ukn\u00fcs  | inde\u010d    | yhdeks\u00e4n|\n| 10 tiz | lou    | jong         | dos    | lu        | kymmenen|\n\nFischer's second work bears the following title: Questiones Petropolitan\u00e6, Edit. Schl\u00f6zer, 1770. The first chapter treats of questions bearing upon the origin of the Magyar. There is nothing new in it but what is already known from Matthias B\u00e9l\u00b9 and Philipp J. Strahlenberg.\n\nFischer's third work is the vocabulary, already mentioned, compiled from forty Siberian languages. Schl\u00f6zer made use of it from a manuscript copy in the Library at G\u00f6ttingen, and, as we shall see, it was subsequently transcribed by Gyarmathy.\n\nAugustus Ludvig Schl\u00f6zer's General History of the North, appeared in 1771,\u00b2 and deservedly attracted considerable\n\n\u00b9 1.

Schl\u00f6zer furnishes an account of the Scandinavian, Slav and Lettish nations, and also of the Finn, Ugor and Wallachian tribes.\n\nIn the second chapter Schl\u00f6zer describes what he calls the \"primitive nations,\" and he considers to be such the Samojed, Finn, Lett, Slav, German, and the Kimeric, (p. 159) in the north of Europe. The Finn number twelve subdivisions, viz. the Lapp, Finn, Esth, Liv, Sirj\u00e4n, Perm, Vogul, Vot, Cheremiss, Mordvin, Kond (Ostjak), and Magyar. Then follows the vocabulary of Fischer already mentioned.\n\nIn the third chapter there is an account of the Slav people from 412\u20131222 A.D., after the historian Herr Stritter, a German from Ibstein Nassau, employed by the St. Petersburg Academy, a painstaking writer.\u00b9\n\nIn the fourth chapter Schl\u00f6zer follows Fischer's data regarding the history of North Asia, and repeats the opinion as to the affinity between the Vogul and the Magyar. In the fifth chapter there is a description of Finland; the rest of the work treats of the Russ after the Byzantine authors, and mentions certain Scandinavian travellers who visited Constantinople.\n\nSchl\u00f6zer's work was worthy of every consideration, as it deals with important questions which at that period occupied the attention of men of science. Within the short period of four years, between 1768 and 1771, three important works followed, viz. Fischer's History of Siberia in 1768, Sajnovics' Demonstratio, etc., in 1770, and Schl\u00f6zer's in 1771.\n\nP. S. Pallas travelled in the Asiatic provinces of Russia between 1768 and 1774.

The Vogul who dwelt in Tarja-paul (paul = village), near the river Tarja, were already Russianized and converted to Christianity. The author furnishes a comparative vocabulary of the Ostjak, Vogul, and Mordvin dialects. At the desire of the Empress Catherine, Pallas prepared his great comparative dictionary bearing the title \"Vocabularia linguorum totius orbis comparata, Augustissimae curae collecta 1786.\" Klaproth mentions that this laborious work was undertaken solely to please the Empress.\n\nSamuel Gyarmathi, a Hungarian. His work\\(^1\\) was written in Latin; he endeavoured to ascertain the truth as to the affinity between his mother-tongue and the Finn languages. The plan of his investigation was perfectly sound, had he been able fully to carry out the principle he laid down, namely, to rely, not merely on the sounds of words, but on derivatives, inflections, affixes, postpositions, and on the structure of sentences, when comparing one language with another. He came to the conclusion that originally the Vogul dwelt much nearer the Magyar than any other tribe whose idiom he undertook to collate with his own.\n\nJoannes Sajvorics, S.J., tried to establish a similarity between the Magyar, his native tongue, and the Lapp language. He spent nearly a whole year in Finnmark, as one of the astronomers selected by the Imperial University of Vienna, at the request of the King Christian VII. of Denmark, to observe the transit of Venus in 1769. His philological researches were submitted to the Danish Academy of Science.\\(^2\\)\n\nPaulus Nagy of Beregsz\u00e1sz, also a Hungarian, wrote on the similarity of the Magyar tongue and the languages of the east; his work was published under the title \"Disser-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Affinitas linguae Hungaricae cum linguis Finnicis originis grammaticae demonstrata nec non: Vocabularia dialectorum Tataricarum et Slavicarum cum Hungarica comparata.

He asserts that the Hungarians came from the south, and not from the north, and are of Turki origin.\n\nJulius Klaproth. As a result of his travels in the Caucasus, Klaproth published several works on the philology of Eastern Russia. The two following are of special interest to our subject, namely, a Treatise\\(^1\\) on the Language and Writing of the Ujgur, and the Asia Polyglotta.\\(^2\\)\n\nIn the first work, speaking of the language of the Ujgur, he criticizes those authors, who, following the Byzantine writers, were led to assume that the Ugur of the Greeks, the Jugor of the Russians, and the Ujgur of the Turks, refer to the same people. Klaproth thinks, on the contrary, that the Hun cannot be looked upon as the Ujgur or the Turk, but rather that the Hun country and relatives are to be sought for in Western Siberia, in the vicinity of the Ural Mountains.\n\nIn his \u201cAsia Polyglotta,\u201d Klaproth modified this opinion, and, contrary to previous statements, declared that the Vogul and Ostjak languages were closely related to the Finn. He makes mention of five Finn dialects, but describes only three, namely, the Germanized Finn, probably the Lapp-Est, and the Finn proper, the Finn on the Volga, that is, the Perm, Votjak and Syrjaen, and Ugrie Finn, namely, the Vogul, the Ostjak around the river Ob, and the Magyar. Klaproth\u2019s theory is, that after the dissolution of Attila\u2019s empire, about 462 A.D., the Ugrie nations emerged from beyond the regions of the Volga, namely, the Unogur, Saragur, and Urog. The most powerful among them appear to have been the Unogur, who in due course became known as Ugor, Ujgor, and Ungor; these are said to have been the ancestors of the Hungarians whom the Russian chronieters call Ugor. It is very probable that some of the Ugor tribe remained in their ancient abodes, and that their descendants are the Bashkir tribes of the present day, who forgot their own language, and adopted the Tatar (Turki) idioms. Pater Ruysbroek\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Abhandlung \u00fcber die Sprache und Schrift der Ujguren, Paris, 1820.\n\n\\(^2\\) Asia Polyglotta, Paris, 1831, Second edition.\n(Rubruquis), who visited that country in 1253, mentions, that after a journey of twelve days, starting from Ettilia (Volga), he came to another great river, the Jagog or Jaik, flowing from the north from the country of the Paskatir people, and that he found the idiom of the Paskatir country was the same as that spoken by the Magyar. De Plano Carpini, who travelled to the Great Khan in 1246, seems to confirm this statement, by saying that the country of the Bulgar (Belerch) was called Great Bulgaria in the same manner as the country of the Bashkir Great Magyaria. In the middle ages, the region around the Ural as far as the river Jaik went by the name of \"Ugor\" or \"Unger.\" From this it would follow that, what was called Jugria or Jugoria, inhabited at the present day by the Vogul and the Ostjak, was really the ancient home of the Hungarians extending from the Ob as far as the river Jaik. The Jugur, that is, the Vogul and the Ostjak, spoke the same language, the roots of all the Finn idioms being similar to those of the Magyar. Klapproth therefore concludes that the Vogul and Ostjak are the nearest relatives of the Magyar, both as to language and descent.\n\nThe Ostjak call themselves As-jah, which, according to Klapproth, is the plural number of As-chuj, signifying \"inhabitant near the Ob,\" already referred to. Klapproth, in his \"Sprach-Atlas,\" gives a list of Vogul words copied from Pallas's Russian vocabulary. Gyarmathi quotes it. Professor Hunfalvy accompanies the same with critical annotations.\u00b9 It is a collection of 400 Vogul words found in the authors preceding Reguly. The conclusion Hunfalvy comes to is this, that the words annotated by the above investigators cannot serve as proofs in philological inquiry; the Vogul idiom having no literature, it underwent many changes and was split into several dialects. The authors mentioned above were moreover ignorant of the fundamental principles of the structure of language, particularly of the subjective and objective affixes; the only really useful and important data are the similarity of the numerals, first recorded by Strahlenberg, and after him by every writer of Finn-Ugor philology.\n\n\u00b9 Reguly A. Hagyom, p. 18.\nIt may be safely assumed that languages possessing identical words for the numerals must be related. This we find in the Vogul and Magyar languages in the same manner as in the Aryan, Semitic and Altaic family of languages respectively. A peculiarity of the Ugric group in this respect is worth noting here, namely, that up to number seven, the words are simple roots; eight and nine are compound words; this is not the case in the Aryan and Semitic languages. Besides the resemblance between words for the numerals, there is also a resemblance between those referring to parts of the human body and to various objects of nature. I have, in Appendix No. I., added a short list of such similar sounds.\n\nProfessor Hunfalvy therefore maintains that there exists a relationship between the Magyar and the Vogul, and consequently between the Magyar and the whole group of Finn languages, such a relationship as cannot be found between the Magyar and any of the languages in the catalogue of the Aryan and Semitic families. In the derivatives the similarity is still more apparent.\n\nStrahlenberg, Fischer, Schl\u00f6zer, and Klaproth, started in a right direction when examining the numerals, the names of the parts of the human body, and other words for things pertaining to nature and its phenomena; all these inquirers came to believe that the Magyar and the Vogul languages must be considered as having a common origin. But by far the most important researches on this subject are undoubtedly those of Anton Reguly, who, when scarcely twenty years of age, started for the north to devote his energies to that study to which his countrymen Sajnovics, Gyarmathi, R\u00e9vai, and others had, during the two preceding centuries, devoted some attention. Reguly was born of noble parents in the town of Zircz, in the county of Veszpr\u00e9m, in the south-east of Hungary, on the 13th July, 1819. He studied at the Gymnasium of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, from 1828 to 1834, and afterwards in the Academy of Gy\u00f6r in 1834 to 1836. The following three years, from 1836 till 1839, he spent at the University of Pesth, studying law and political sciences. The summer vacations of 1837 and 1838 he spent in travel-\nling through Upper Hungary, through the Duchy of Austria, in Moravia, and Galicia. It is not certain whether Reguly had studied through the works of his predecessors, although the results arrived at by them could scarcely be regarded as making any real progress in the direction of Finn-Ugor philology. Francis Toldy, writing in 1845, well describes the position in which this inquiry was left by the Hungarian savants just mentioned, when he says: \"Certain it is that that the discovery of Finn relationship has evoked no marked opposition, but neither has it any particular sympathy. The suggestion has been set aside or scarcely noticed by the scholars of the day; and the nation at large ignored it completely. Without fear of contradiction we may, therefore, safely say that the Finn-Ugor affinity was neither accepted nor disbelieved. Such being the case, it was evident that the pending question must finally be decided either by a Finn who knew Magyar, or by a Hungarian who would undertake the study of the Ural-Altaic languages. Reguly seemed, therefore, to be the man destined to solve the still pending problem.\" In 1839, with the approval of his parents, Reguly planned a journey of four months duration.\n\nHe started on the 15th of July, touching at Vienna, Dresden, Leipzig, Berlin, Rostock. From Hamburg he was to commence his return journey home, but the nearness of Scandinavia induced Reguly to embark for Copenhagen, Gottenburg, and Stockholm. At the last place he became acquainted with the Finn scholar Arwidson, Librarian to the King, who took great interest in the handsome and intelligent young Hungarian, and was often engaged in conversation with him on the Finn language and people. Reguly had frequent opportunities of meeting natives of Finland, and thereby became interested in that language. The importance of this subject grew upon him; he became anxious to obtain as much knowledge as he could, before continuing his northward journey. He therefore studied the works of Sajnovics and Gyarmathi, the conclusions of the latter especially impressed him very much. Gyarmathi had only the acquaintance, though a very imperfect one, of the western Finn dialects,\nthose spoken eastward he hardly mentions at all; \"yet even so,\" says Reguly, \"there are in his book many proofs of affinity between the Finn language and the Magyar, and this question therefore appeared to me very important from a patriotic point of view, and well worthy of further investigation.\" Full of hope and youthful ardour Reguly abandoned the idea of returning to Hungary; he spent yet some time at Stockholm before starting for Helsingfors, at which place he arrived about the middle of December. To his vexation Reguly soon became aware of the serious impediments which his unpreparedness for the work before him placed in the way. Enthusiasm can stimulate energy, but there is no royal road to acquiring knowledge, especially philological knowledge. At Helsingfors Castr\u00e9n became his friend, and was willing to assist the young Hungarian in the study of the Finnish lore; but young Reguly was only a beginner in philology, without overmuch general knowledge and experience besides. After three months at Helsingfors, he resumed the northward journey, and reached the parish of Laukas, a distance of 300 versts from Helsingfors. At the village of Lamasaho he obtained accommodation at a Finn peasant's house, and began to study the language. In ten weeks' time Reguly made sufficient progress to make himself understood in Finnish. The homestead of a well-to-do Finn peasant consists of some twenty or thirty separate buildings. In one of these Reguly lived in sufficient comfort, the accommodation being far better than what is obtainable in a common peasant's house in Hungary. He left Lamasaho in May, 1840, and travelled in a northerly direction towards Lapland. In the village Rautalampi Reguly met Paul Korhonen, the famous peasant poet of Finland, already 70 years of age. The obliging old man accompanied our traveller a certain distance. The Whitsuntide was spent at Nurmi, and passing through Sotkamo, Kuusamo, Kenijarvi, Sodankyle and Kittili, he reached Muomoniska and Karesuvanto; here he passed a few weeks with the well-known botanist Lacstadius. It was the season of the midnight sun, the charm of those regions impressed him much. \"With no man have\nI had so much argument as with Laestadius,\" remarks Reguly in a letter dated 11th July. \"I learnt much from him. His speech to me is like the treasure which I have looked for so long. I find, alas! that at home I have learnt nothing.\"\n\nTowards the end of the month Reguly left Lapland and travelling along the rivers Muonio and Torne\u00e5, he reached the towns Torne\u00e5 and Kemi. At the latter place he spent the month of August in the house of Dean Castr\u00e9n, a relative of the philologist. Hence he travelled to the town Vasa, where he hoped to spend the winter and to prepare for a further journey northwards; but circumstances compelled him to return at once to Helsingfors in the beginning of 1841. His friends were surprised at the great progress Reguly had made in the Swedish and Finn languages; his pronunciation of the latter was especially commended. The long-expected letters and pecuniary help reached him in March. He subsequently took the steamer to Reval, and thence visited Dorpat and Narva. On this occasion he made an excursion into Estland, and arrived at St. Petersburg on the 11th of June.\n\nReguly felt that he was ready to enter the field of study for comparative Finn philology and history, having now the prospect of better times for the future. To obtain this, he thought a visit to Eastern Finland desirable, and he wrote to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences as follows: \"On the 26th of July I received a letter from the Academy in which several points are mentioned referring to the origin and linguistic affinity of the Hungarians, questions towards the solution of which my studies are now directed. I desire to express my views on this subject as far as I am able, and to formulate them. I had favourable opportunities for such a study at St. Petersburg, and the Academy will now be in a position to judge whether my efforts run in a right direction or not. There is, doubtless, no safer mode of arriving at a proper decision in questions of this nature than through the study and comparison of languages. Gyarmathi, with very slender linguistic knowledge, discovered some similarity between the Hungarian and Western Finn languages.\" Reguly thought that the time had arrived when\nthe pending question should, by the help of science, be decided. \"What an immense gain to Hungarian philology would accrue if we discover that the supposed affinity is a real one?\" \"There may,\" he said, \"among the Finn dialects, be found one which is an elder sister of our common tongues, or by comparing the Finn dialects with each other, a primitive language may be discovered, from which our own has grown? What an important step it would be if we could trace the laws of the origin, the development, and changes in our Hungarian mother-tongue. I have therefore made up my mind to continue the labours of Gyarmathi. I shall commence work like a digger after hidden treasures, ignorant whether he may find anything at all in the track, and should his labours prove fruitless, that much at least he may say to his countrymen, do not look for results in that direction.\"\n\nLinguistic researches lead necessarily to history and ethnology; if, therefore, there be a similarity of language, it may be surmised that ethnology will lead to corresponding results. But this is just that subject which, as Reguly points out, \"is not in any great favour with Hungarians. Truth, however, must prevail, and prejudices based on ignorance will have to be laid aside. Physical appearance of populations is subject to changes according to various circumstances among which they live. Take, for instance, the striking characteristics existing among the Western Finn tribes; those of the H\u00e4metavastland are of a sulky disposition, stupid and dirty in their habits; the Karjal\u00e4ans, on the other hand, are open-hearted, clean and of a sociable disposition, yet their language is the same. We find a similar condition between the brave Sajot in the Altaic region and the Samojed on the Frozen Sea, as we do between the Turk and the Jakut; in both cases the respective idioms are identical. From the little knowledge I gathered at St. Petersburg concerning Finn languages I should place the Finn dialects of the north and east within the same class with the Magyar.\" Reguly thereafter discusses the formation of the infinitive mood, the participles, derivation of substantive nouns, etc., which appeared to him very striking. \"I submit the\nquestion,\" writes our traveller, \"to the judgment of the Academy of Sciences for decision, namely, in how far I have been able to approach the subject? If circumstances permit, I should at once start towards the Ural Mountains, to study the Vogul and Ostjak languages. We know as yet very little about them; but what we do know seems of the greatest importance, both as to the structure of the language, and the phonetic resemblance of particular words. From an historical point, the Vogul seem the most interesting tribe. Their neighbours, the Sirj\u00e4en, call them Yogra, which reminds one of the ancient name 'Ugor,' or 'Yugor,' at least the Russians pronounce the word so. The name 'Yugria' was given to the country where the Yogra people lived. A Russian word for Hungary is Yugri (Vengertsi), which is a striking coincidence.\"\n\n\"The Vogul call themselves Man-\u00e9i; in this way the derivation of the word 'Magyar' may possibly be arrived at.\"\n\nReguly remained at St. Petersburg for two years and three months, preparing for his philological researches. The Academicians of St. Petersburg showed him much friendly sympathy, till at last the necessary assistance from home had reached him, and he then resumed the journey to the Ural. A certain coincidence will be noticed between the primary motives of research of Alexander Csoma de K\u00f6r\u00f6s and of Anton Reguly. Csoma, whilst travelling through Syria, Persia, Afghanistan, Panjab, Turkestan and Tibet, found friends and patrons among English officers; Reguly speaks of much friendliness and assistance given him by the Russians. He left the Russian capital on the 9th of October, 1843. On the 21st he arrived at Nijni Novgorod, and on the 27th in Kazan. Here he met many learned men among the Professors of the University, and obtained valuable information as to the Cheremiss and Chuvash languages. From Kazan he hastened towards Perm, visiting on the way the Votjak tribe; after a short sojourn among them, he arrived, on the 20th of November, at Solikamsk, north of the town of Perm, on the small river of Usolka.\n\nFrom Solikamsk Reguly travelled to Usolja near the Vogul\ncountry. Here he enjoyed for four days the hospitality of Mr. Volegow, the director of a salt manufactory. This gentleman gave Reguly a vocabulary containing 4000 Vogul words, and our traveller besides made valuable memoranda on the ethnography of the Perm tribe, and collected data as to the history and topography of the country. A journey of two days more brought him to the foot of the Ural Mountains which he crossed in safety on the 4th of December. These mountains nowhere exceed the height of 4000 feet. The first place Reguly stopped at was Verhoturje on the river Tura; Pallas calls it T\u00e9r. This settlement appears to have been built on the ruins of a Vogul fort, and is now the seat of the Government, having jurisdiction over all the Vogul settlements. In the local archives here Reguly hoped to obtain some information; but the public documents he found in utter disorder, consequently not available for his purpose. Sixty miles north of this is Bogoslovsk, where he made the acquaintance of Mr. Protasov, director of a gold-washing expedition, which extends its operations as far as the river Sertan, a tributary of the Sinja. The maps he found here were of great assistance to him. Reguly mentions having secured two Vogul skulls. The senior priest of the place most good naturedly offered to show Reguly the way into the interior of the Vogul country, where he had lived for thirty-five years, and was therefore well acquainted with the people. On the 15th of December Reguly and the priest arrived at Vsevolodoz-Blagodatsky, where Senator Boroskov, the manager of the estates of the family Vsevolodski, received the traveller kindly and entertained him most hospitably. Here Reguly parted with his guide the priest, whose continued services on the journey along the river Losva would have been superfluous. His host, the Senator, procured two intelligent Voguls named Turkini and Bakhtiar, both very old men, the one 79 and the other 60 years of age. Their hair was still black, the skin of a dark colour as is the Vogul generally; they are more intelligent, and of livelier disposition, than the Finn tribes generally, and ready to give intelligent answers. The difficulty to overcome was the language, Russian being the\nonly mode of communication. Reguly was much gratified with the conduct of his new acquaintances, and always spoke of the companionship of these two old Vogul men as the only pleasure he ever enjoyed during his whole expedition. The elder of the two was anxious to return to his home, but Bakhtiar remained. His good temper and unwearied patience and good nature were beyond praise. Reguly's questions, as may be supposed, were inexhaustible. \"Bakhtiar's services to me are as important as is his position among his own people,\" says Reguly. \"He is a Vogul minstrel, and often officiates as priest at the horse sacrifices, which are practised every year by the Voguls. This double qualification of Bakhtiar's is a rich source of valuable information to me. My annotations of songs, prayers and hymns, made from his dictation, exceed twenty sheets of writing already; they throw a remarkable light, not merely on the material and intellectual condition of his countrymen, but they are important also in a linguistic point of view. I have effected a collection of 2600 words already, and am beginning to speak the Vogul dialect; moreover, I am fairly well informed as to the structure of the language. Its near relationship in that respect to the Magyar is unquestionable; pursuing the subject in this direction, Magyar philology will be possible. As I accumulate the treasures of the Vogul tongue, my knowledge of Finn etymology is widening, and the studies I now pursue will be important to Finn philology as well.\"\n\nThe settlement of Vsevolodskoi was at that time the most distant Russian station on the Ural, about 240 versts from Verhoturje. Reguly spent three months there. In company with Bakhtiar he used to make excursions into the adjacent regions. On one occasion two Vogul men appeared before him, coming from the north of the river Sosva, with the view of making the acquaintance, as they said, of the man whom they thought to have been specially sent to the Vogul people, requesting him to pay a visit to their country; they offered to send reindeer to speed Reguly on his journey to them. These Vogul messengers made a stay of two days, and gave much topographical information, which Reguly was careful to note on his map.\nLater on he made the acquaintance of Alexis Kasimow, a man of great wealth, being the possessor of nearly 19,000 reindeer. These herds spread over a large territory, he therefore knew the country well. Reguly had the good fortune of enjoying this man's company for five days, during which he elicited information regarding the region beyond the Ural, ascertained the direction of the rivers and mountain ranges, also the height of the peaks, all of which were carefully noted down.\n\nDuring his stay in the Ural Mountains Reguly compiled a Vogul vocabulary, containing upwards of 5000 words. He furthermore copied and arranged annotations of Vogul songs, covering thirty sheets of foolscap. Thus provided, our traveller took leave of the manager of the Vsevolodski estates, who had entertained him most hospitably for three months whilst in the country.\n\nOn the 2nd of March Reguly turned his steps southward, towards Irbit (57\u00b0 lat.), thence, after five days rest, he touched Turinsk and made his way towards the river Tavda, where he spent a few days with the Vogul people. From this spot he marched along the course of the rivers Tavda and Tobol, and reached Tobolsk on the 17th March. He hoped to meet here pastor Vologodski, who for many years lived among the Ostjak tribes, and was writing a grammar and dictionary of their language. The other man Reguly looked for was Satigin, the learned son of the last Vogul chief. This man held the appointment of a schoolmaster under the Russian government, and was the author of several works in the Vogul tongue. Unfortunately the pastor had left the place some time ago; but Satigin furnished such information as he was able, considering his long absence from the country of his birth, which caused him to forget much of his mother-tongue. Reguly was fortunate to meet Castr\u00e9n here.\n\nStill accompanied by his faithful Vogul friend and teacher Bakhtiar, Reguly travelled down the river Irtis to Demiansk, and then across the country to the river Konda. He spent some time at Bolcharova, a village with a church, the people being Ostjak, whose dialect, the Konda, Reguly thought would be of service in better understanding the Vogul.\nFrom Boleharova Reguly travelled up the stream along the tributaries of the Kouda as far as Sajmi, and across the country to the river Pelim, where he arrived on the 11th of April, and stayed among the Vogul to arrange his memoranda.\n\nThis was the second visit Reguly paid to the Vogul country, arriving this time from the easterly direction; he found that the people were not as friendly to him now as when he first visited them, coming then from the Ural Mountains. A rumour was spread about him, namely, that he was possessed of magic power, and was cutting off people's heads, covering them with plaster of Paris. This was doubtless owing to the fact that Reguly was taking casts, and carried the necessary apparatus for that purpose with him. Matters went so far that on one occasion some women threatened his life; but after a while the excitement subsided, and the people became friendly again. On this, his second visit, Reguly was permitted to witness a national Vogul festival and the sacrifice of a horse.\n\nTwo months were spent at Pelim, a miserable place. The so-called society there, according to Ahlquist, consisting of a Government official, an exile, the priest, who was a common peasant, a publican, and the clerk, an ill-conditioned youth, a drunken surgeon, and a blacksmith.\n\nOn the 24th of June, 1844, Reguly left the village, and travelling by boat up the river Pelim, he arrived at Atimja-paul, which is the northernmost hamlet on the river Pelim. From there he continued the upward journey for five more days, passing through a desert country, only a hut was visible here and there, used as shelter during the hunting and fishing seasons. On the sixth day, accompanied by half a dozen Vogul men, Reguly left his boat near a point where the Pelim river approaches the river Tapsija. This delta our traveller determined to cross on foot. At the commencement of the journey everything promised well, the weather being favourable; but as clouds gathered and poured down torrents of rain, and as at the foot of the hills the paths led the travellers into morasses and floating bogs, through which men had to wade knee-deep, their feet often\nbecoming entangled among the roots of trees. After a severe struggle with unexpected difficulties, the party arrived at last opposite the village Kalyim-paul, quite exhausted. Fortunately there was a ferry at that spot, which conveyed the travellers to the village, to enable them to partake of a repast of fish and water-nuts. After a short rest, Reguly\u2019s companions returned home. His further journey led him to the mouth of the river Tapsija, where, at that time, much people were assembled in expectation of abundant fishing.\n\nThe description of Reguly\u2019s travels in this locality reminds one of the heroic endurance of Csoma de K\u00f6r\u00f6s at Zanskar in Tibet. Reguly says, \u201cThe mode of life here, except in a case of actual compulsion, or as a matter of duty, would indeed be difficult to endure. To have allotted to you a corner of the room in a wooden house full of smoke, to repose on a reindeer skin, and have for nourishment nothing but boiled or dried fish, without salt, and without bread: these are hardly compatible with our ordinary habits, and must in a short time become unbearable. Only an enthusiast, supported by a lofty idea, who sees around him the new world of his dreams: only such a one will be capable of enduring the miserable existence\u2014of want and filth which surround him at every step; and yet an enthusiast will find amidst it all satisfaction and even enjoyment.\u201d\n\nAt this place, writes Reguly, \u201cI remained twenty days, spent in studying the dialect spoken there, after which I travelled up the river Sosva as far as the mouth of the Sigva; my steps led me thence to Sukerja-paul, the most northern village on that river, opposite the ruins of the fort of Jujl, at one time a fortified place in those distant regions.\u201d\n\nIn this, the most remote region inhabited by the Vogul, on the borders of the river Man-ja, Reguly found herds of reindeer, the property of a rich Vogul, Tyobing by name. The journey to his tents, on the sources of the river Man-ja, on one of the highest, and consequently coldest plateaux of the Ural, was difficult and very fatiguing to accomplish; but\n\n1 Reguly Hagyom, p. 60.\n2 An old name of the river Sosva.\nthe companionship of his new host, from whom Reguly obtained hospitality and much valuable information, was most interesting. Reguly had fresh opportunities of enhancing linguistic knowledge, and of obtaining information as to the geography of that region. The country between the rivers Sosva and Sigva has scarcely been visited at all by European travellers; a map therefore had to be prepared either from personal experience or from information culled on the spot. The tract of land along the two rivers just mentioned is the boundary between the Ostjak and Vogul tribes, who, at the time Reguly stayed there, were much estranged from each other.\n\nAt the river Sinja Reguly's travels were brought to an end, having reached the extreme limit of $58^\\circ-60^\\circ$ N. lat. and $76^\\circ-85^\\circ$ E. long., comprising 3780 square geographical miles, with a population computed at only 6342 souls. In the exploration of this country Reguly spent nine months; he then devoted himself to ethnological and linguistic studies of the Ostjak. In the course of the month of September, 1844, Reguly arrived in Tildom on the river Sinja, thence passing the rivers Vojkar, Larus, and Sob; on the 27th he crossed the river Ob and reached the village of Obdorsk, consisting of forty houses, the inhabitants of which drove a profitable trade. On the 10th of October he set out in the direction of the Ural, and at the eminence called M\u00e9nyes (Minissei according to Hoffmann) Reguly reached the most northern peak of the mountain range. Hence the left side of the river Kara was his guide, following it as far as the Straits of Vaigatch. On the return journey along the Kara he reached the forest land on the river Usa, at the Lahorta pass, recrossed the Ural, and made for Berezova, with the view of spending the winter among the Ostjak. On the 3rd of March he again set out along the rivers Sosva and Losva; and returned to Vszevolodskoi, a village which was the first starting-point of Reguly's journey towards the country lying on the north of the Ural. Through Ekaterinburg and Perm he reached Kazan. The date is not mentioned by Professor Hunfalvy, whose laborious and valuable work entitled \"Reguly Antal Hagyom\u00e1nyai\nPest 1864,\" has rendered invaluable assistance in the preparation of this short and very imperfect paper. Reguly's strong constitution suffered much from the long-continued hardships. In the hope of recruiting his health, on the way to his native country, he spent the winter of 1847 at Graefenberg, in Austrian Silesia. Here the writer of this paper met him accidentally, and learnt many incidents of his perilous journeyings. Reguly used to speak of the kindness and sympathy experienced by him at the hands of friends in Russia, particularly from the members of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, among them M. Baer and M. Kunig. The latter paid him a visit at Graefenberg. Reguly was able to render important service to the Russians by the publication of a map at St. Petersburg in 1846.\u00b9 Dr. Hoffmann,\u00b2 the leader of the Russian scientific expedition in the years of 1847\u20131850, speaks of it thus: \"Mr. Reguly's return from his travels in the north was a lucky event for our expedition, he having just been exploring the country of the Vogul, Ostjak, Syrjan, and the Samojed tribes, as far as the most northern range of the Ural leading to the shores of the Arctic Sea. His diary contains rich treasure of information of all he saw there, and he placed with the greatest readiness the results of his experience at my service, and at the request of Admiral L\u00fcttke prepared a map of the region lying between the 50\u00b0\u201370\u00b0 N. lat. The map, imperfect as it was, has been of essential service, and it contains names of rivers and mountains which we could never have pointed out to our native guides as the landmarks to lead us on our way. This map was used by Ahlquist also.\u00b3 A stay among the Silesian mountains was unfortunately of little avail to the patient. His powers seemed to have become utterly unstrung, and he never felt well enough to resume any enduring exertion, bodily or mental.

Truly a self-sacrificing and unselfish man, whose memory well deserves to rank with the martyrs to science.\n\nThe literary treasures brought home by him remained unarranged at his death; the task, as already mentioned, was accomplished by Hunfalvy.\u00b9\n\nReguly's Vogul and Ostjak literary annotations consist:\n\nI. The Vogul Documents.\n\nA. From the Vogul of the North: 1. Stories, \"Majt.\" Seven in number, describing the creation, the universal flood, etc. 2. Songs, \"Erit and Jerit,\" chiefly in praise of the bear and of the goose, five in number. 3. Incantations.\n\nB. From the Vogul of the South: 1. A Story, its subject being a woman's darling grandchild. 2. Songs. a. On martial subjects; on forests and rivers. b. In praise of the bear. This animal is highly esteemed in the Vogul country. Songs used on occasions of bear festivals, thirteen in number. 3. Prayers and praises, seven in number. 4. Dance and festival songs, eleven in number. 5. Songs on miscellaneous subjects, eleven in number. 6. Songs from the Pelim country, five in number.\n\nC. Translations into Vogul from Russian. a. T\u00e2r\u00eem Kvoshin. Our Father, etc. b. Lov zapoved T\u00e2r\u00eem. The Ten Commandments of God.\n\n\u00b9 The following explanation is given by Professor Hunfalvy as to the meaning of the name Ma yar in his work Die Ungern, p. 39, etc.: We know, says the Professor, that the Magyar race came from Scythia, which country had three provinces, viz. Bascardia, Dentia and Magoria, the country of the Jorians being its easterly neighbour. The Hungarian chronicler \"Anonymus Belae regis Notarius,\" calls Scythia \"a very large kingdom in the east,\" and he calls it Dentu-Mogeria. From this description we may infer that the Jorian or Jurian country lay to the east of Dentia and Magoria, and that it was the Jugoria or Juharia, spoken of by Byzantine writers that was the land of the Ogor or Ugor. This country was conquered by Ivan III. and annexed to Moscow. Under the name of Jugoria was comprised the country of the Ostjak and Vogul; the extent of it was, according to Lehrberg (op cit.), sixteen thousand geographical square miles. The name Unger corresponds to Ogor, Ugor or Jugor, known to the Byzantines as early as the tenth century. Moger, Magor and Magyar Prof Hunfalvy explains by the Hungarian word gyer-ek, or gyerm-ek, corresponding to the Vogul k\u00e4r, k\u00e4rem, meaning 'a man.' The Hungarian word gyerm-ek (a diminutive) means a male child. The Vogul word ma, mo, signifies 'the land,' the same as in Finn maa, and kum, 'a man.' The letter k is interchanged with g when in apposition with a vowel, therefore ma-gum, in Vogul 'an inhabitant.' The same way ma and k\u00e4r became (in Vogul tongue) ma-ger, mo-g\u00e4r, which Prof Hunfalvy thinks to be identical with ma-ger, mo-ger=mavjar, meaning 'the man of the country, a countryman.' The name of the Dravidian tribe Maler, meaning 'a man' (Rev. E. Droese, Malto Language, Agra, 1884) is a noteworthy coincidence.\nII. The Ostjak Documents.\n\nThese are much fewer and less important than the Vogul.\n\n1. Polm T\u00e2rom ar, song to the God Polm, on three sheets.\n2. In praise of Nating the Chief. On eight sheets.\n3. In praise of the Sosva country. On nineteen sheets.\n4. In praise of Munkes, the god of war. On seven sheets.\n5. In praise of the peak of Puling Mountain. On sixteen sheets.\n6. Song \"of Lung-aut n'al ari,\" in praise of the town of Lu. On four sheets.\n7. Song on the Ostjak chief. On twelve sheets.\n8. Song in praise of Angve, wife of Pulingaut. On two sheets.\n9. Song, on the chief's attaining his manhood. On eight sheets.\n10 and 11. Two songs entitled, Uort ar, Song of the Prince, and Tom\u00e4 Kaltmem K\u00e4li Ki. The former on ten, the latter on three sheets.\n\nNo further details are given of these last literary annotations here, but they are noticed in the Ostjak and Vogul grammars.\n\nHere we pause to fulfil the pleasant duty of giving a short account of Professor Hunfalvy's book: a quarto volume, published in Hungarian by the Academy of Sciences, in 364 pages. It is divided into three parts, preceded by an introduction, showing what was generally known of the peoples living on the Ural before Reguly visited them.\n\nPart I. describes the land of the Vogul and boundaries; its geography; the products of the animal and vegetable kingdoms; habits of the people, their dwellings, occupations, and family life. Details are quoted from Strahlenberg, Pallas, Castr\u00e8n, Ahlquist, and from Reguly's annotations.\n\nPart II. treats of what was known of the ancestors of the Vogul from tradition; there is an account of their religious belief; how T\u00e2rom created the world; the stories of giants, of water deities, and of those of the forest; an account of the flood; their national ceremonies are described, which, besides horse sacrifices and the worship of the bear, show influences of Shamanism and Buddhism. A translation is given of the Lord's Prayer and the Ten Commandments. Almost all from Reguly's annotations.\nPart III. is devoted to the consideration of the relationship of the Vogul to the Magyar, based on the testimony of linguistic and historical data.\n\nReguly's researches are being followed up at present under the patronage of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, by three zealous Hungarian philologists, namely, Mr. Ferdinand Barna, among the Finn and Lapp; Mr. Bernat Munk\u00e1csy and Dr. Charles P\u00e1pai on the east of the Ural, in western Siberia, among the Vogul and Ostjak people. An important preliminary report has been sent by Dr. P\u00e1pai, dated in the vicinity of Narym, written in October, 1888, and published by the Hungarian Geographical Society, vol. xvi. parts ix. and x. in French.\n\nApart from many distinguished men of science who in various seats of learning promote linguistic research, Helsinki and Budapest are the two principal points from which, by a number of zealous and competent workers, impulse to Finn-Ugor philological studies steadily proceeds. Prof. O. Donner and Prof. Joseph Budenz have, after years of labour, each published their comparative dictionaries of Finn-Ugor languages, works of high value and of eminent scholarship. The latter has also edited a comparative \"Treatise of Grammatical Forms of Ugor Languages\" (Alaktan), from which we learn that each language belonging to the Ugor family has developed, to a greater or less extent, its own grammatical forms; that is to say, we notice in each language a separate word-formation of its own for substantive nouns and for verbs. There are also separate suffixes of nouns, separate adverbial forms and adverbial suffixes. Even superficially considered, these linguistic forms lead nevertheless to the conclusion that they present many details common to all Finn-Ugor languages, an evident proof, as Budenz remarks, \"that a certain portion at least of such formations is not the special property of one individual language, but that it is actually the common inheritance, derived from a common ancestral source.\" \"Facts, corroborative of this theory, have already been brought incidentally to light. The time seems therefore to have arrived, when comparative philology of Finn-Ugor\nlanguages may be attempted, its special problem being the reconstruction of the primary tongue, by thorough investigation and elucidation of the common word-treasures appertaining to these languages and by demonstrating the identity or similarity of their grammatical structure.\" In carefully conducting such investigation, it will become apparent by what process each individual language has further utilized and developed the common inheritance, or in how far it may have deviated from it by dropping certain forms, or by creating others, according to its special circumstances and requirements. And the task here is the more arduous, because the Finn-Ugor family is not so fortunate as to possess an ancient model like the Sanskrit to refer to. The very foundations of Finn-Ugor philology have yet to be built up, and this initial difficulty requires much caution, when, according to Budenz, \"phonetic investigations are here of greater importance than hasty etymological deductions\" (\u00d6sszehas: Szot\u00e1r, El\u00f6sz\u00f3 p. vi).\n\nM. Set\u00e4l\u00e4 points out that the manner in which Finn-Ugor words were developed from primary roots was by suffixes. The ulterior formation of roots being effected through derivative-suffixes (Derivations-suffixe), the formation of words proceeded through flexion-suffixes (Flexions-suffixe).\n\nBy adding a derivative suffix to the primary root, its original meaning becomes modified, and thus a new root is formed. Only in its simplest form may the primary root stand for a word, that is to say: instead of a part of a sentence; in other cases flexion-suffixes figure as etymological factors, expressing the relative position of the parts of a sentence.\n\nMidway between the derivative and flexion-suffixes stand what are called the \"characteristics\"; they are, when speaking of nouns, or of the determination of \"locality,\" the signs of the plural number, and, when any reference is made to verbs, then, under the name \"characteristics,\" are understood the signs of moods and tenses.\n\n1 Alaktan, Budapest, 1884, p. 2.\n2 Set\u00e4l\u00e4, E N. Journal Finno-Ougr. Part II. p. 1, et seq. 1887.\nThe chief problem to solve by Finn-Ugor philology therefore is to investigate the formation of verbal roots, with reference to moods and tenses.\n\nEtymologically, the Finn-Ugor languages distinguish only two tenses, namely, the preterite and the present.\n\nAs to the moods, the indicative has no separate distinction, since the verbal root is the root of the indicative mood.\n\nThe imperative in Finn-Ugor languages stands, by reason of its special form, separately from the indicative.\n\nUnder the name \"conjunctive or subjunctive mood,\" are understood all the modus-forms, which express the action, depending on or proceeding from the will or idea of the speaker. The particular suffixes which determine the various roots of the subjunctive mood, are of great importance in Finn-Ugor languages.\n\nThe following is the resum\u00e9 of the root-formations of the moods and tenses (Modus und Tempus Stammbildung); they are supposed to have been settled:\n\nA. during the first, or primary period, viz. before any separation of the Finn-Ugor family into different branches:\n   1. The present, showing a suffix \\(-ke\\),\\(^1\\) or \\(-ge\\).\n   2. The preterite by a suffix \\(-je\\).\n   3. Indicative and imperative moods without any specially determinable element.\n   4. The subjunctive mood being characterized by the suffix \\(-ne\\).\n\nB. Previous to the separation of the Finn-Ugor family into various dialects, the present tense was indicated by suffixes: \\(pe\\) and \\(be\\), and in this form seems particularly to prevail in the Finn, Lapp, Cheremiss, Mordvin, Syrjaen, and Votjak. There is an uncertainty here as to the subjunctive with a suffix of \\(-ke\\), so well noticeable in Finn, Lapp and Mordvin.\n\nC. After the separation into individual languages the following forms have developed:\n   1. In the formation of the present: in Lapp \\(-je\\) (Mordv. \\(-i\\); Syrj. \\(-i\\); Ostj. \\(-l-\\) etc.; Votj. \\(-shk\\); Magy. \\(-sz-\\).\n   2. The preterite formations are noted with the following\n\n\\(^1\\) The sign \\(e\\) stands for an undetermined vowel.\nsuffixes: Magyar, -tt-, -t-; Cher. sh- (Mordv. -\u017c, -\u015b); Vogul and Ost. -s-.\n\n3. The subjunctive formations, with the following simple and compound suffixes, viz. Finn-Lapp. -le; Finn. -i+-kse, -ue+i+kse; Lapp. -i+n-+ch-; Mordv. kse+le, -l+ksi+-le.\n\nThe above rules may be expressed more concisely thus:\n\na. Roots of tenses in Finn-Ugor languages are noun-roots, that is, roots expressive of (the noun of) the agent.\n\nb. Verbal roots without any special modus-element assume functions of indicative and imperative roots. The meaning of the imperative depends upon its interjectional function (interjectionelle Funktion).\n\nc. The roots of the subjunctive are verbal roots formed by special verbal suffixes (Set\u00e4l\u00e4, op. cit. p. 182).\n\n### Declension\n\n| Finn | Magyar |\n|------|--------|\n| **Finn-Ugor Suffixes** |        |\n| **Sing.** | **Plural.** | **Sing.** | **Plural.** |\n| Nominative taatto | taatto-t | atya | aty\u00e1-k | father, fathers. |\n| Indefinite taatto-a | \u2014\u2014ja | (fortaatto-ta) | (fortaatto-ta) |\n| Genitive taatto-n | \u2014\u2014jen | \u2014\u2014in | aty\u00e1-\u00e9 | \u2014\u2014k-\u00e9 | \u2014\u2014of |\n| Accusative taatto-n | \u2014\u2014t | aty\u00e1-t | \u2014\u2014k-at |\n| Inessive taatto-ssa | \u2014\u2014issa | aty\u00e1-ban | \u2014\u2014k-ban | \u2014\u2014in |\n| Elative taatto-sta | \u2014\u2014ista | aty\u00e1-b\u00f3l | \u2014\u2014k-b\u00f3l | \u2014\u2014out of |\n| Illative taatto-hon | \u2014\u2014ihin | aty\u00e1-ba | \u2014\u2014k-ba | \u2014\u2014into |\n| Adessive taatto-lla | \u2014\u2014illa | aty\u00e1-n\u00e1l | \u2014\u2014k-n\u00e1l | \u2014\u2014near |\n| Ablative taatto-lta | \u2014\u2014ilta | aty\u00e1-t\u00f3l | \u2014\u2014k-t\u00f3l | \u2014\u2014of |\n| Allative taatto-lle | \u2014\u2014ille | aty\u00e1-hoz | \u2014\u2014k-hoz | \u2014\u2014to (near) |\n| Abessive taatto-tta | \u2014\u2014itta | aty\u00e1-tlan | \u2014\u2014without |\n| Prolative taatto-tse | \u2014\u2014itse | aty\u00e1-n\u00e1l | \u2014\u2014k-n\u00e1l | \u2014\u2014by (near) |\n| Translative taatto ksi | \u2014\u2014iksi | aty\u00e1-v\u00e1 | \u2014\u2014k-v\u00e1 | \u2014\u2014as (-k\u00e1) |\n| Essive taatto-na | \u2014\u2014ina | aty\u00e1-\u00fal | \u2014\u2014k-\u00fal | \u2014\u2014like |\n| Conjunctive taatto-ne | \u2014\u2014ine | aty\u00e1-st\u00f3l | \u2014\u2014with |\n| Instructive taatto-n | \u2014\u2014in | aty\u00e1-val | \u2014\u2014k-val | \u2014\u2014by means (k-kal) |\nConjugation.\n\nA.

IX.\u2014The O'm\u00e1nee Dialect of Arabic. By Surgeon-Major A. S. G. Jayakar, M.R.A.S.\n\nPART I.\n\nThe dialectical variations of a language principally consist of deviations from the standard rules of Grammar and accent, and in the adoption of certain words in preference to others. In this latter respect Arabic is particularly remarkable, as owing to the copiousness of its vocabulary, its dialects are so strongly marked as to render the speech of an uneducated inhabitant of one province sometimes almost unintelligible to an equally uneducated inhabitant of another province. In the case of educated Arabs, however, although the colloquial language may be affected by the dialectical influence, still, in writing, the established rules of grammar are generally observed, and words with universally accepted meaning are only used. It follows, therefore, that the state of education of a province must influence to a considerable extent the degree of departure from standard rules in the dialect of that province.\n\nIn Oman learning has never flourished to the same extent as in other parts of Arabia, which may be observed by the almost total absence of any local literature, and although at one time a school of some eminence existed at Nezwa, the province has not produced any great poets or authors. The masses as a rule, as in other countries, are uneducated, but even the educated few are so regardless of the rules of Grammar, that they are constantly in the habit of using, both colloquially and in writing, forms and expressions which strike as strange to an outsider.\nWhatever may have been the dialect of Arabic spoken in Oman at the first occupation of the province by the Yam\u00e1nee Arabs under Malik ibn Fahn, this much is certain that in the present dialect one often meets with traces of the influence exerted on the language by the Persian invasions and occupation of the province, and also by a long-continued intercourse with the people of India, particularly in the terms used in the trades; this is perhaps more apparent in the sea-coast towns. Among other circumstances which have given such marked features to the dialect, especially in the adoption of rare words, the part played by the favourite authors of the people is not to be overlooked. Next to the Koran the only books almost universally read and committed to memory are the \"Muk\u00e1m\u00e1s of al-Hareeree\" and the \"Dewan of al-Mutnabbee\"; it is not, therefore, to be wondered at that words of most unusual occurrence, perhaps only used by these authors, have crept into the language of every-day life. On the other hand, words, although purely Arabic in their origin, have been adopted with significations either totally different from what is generally understood by educated Arabs, or so far removed from the original sense that it is sometimes difficult to trace the connexion. In some cases the words themselves are distorted, the distortion consisting either simply in the transposition of letters, or, as in the case of the word \u062c\u064e\u062a\u064e\u062a\u0652\u064a\u0652\u0646\u0650 for \u0625\u0650\u062b\u0652\u0646\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u0650 (two), in the double process of substitution and transposition of letters.\n\nThe Om\u00e1nees, as a general rule, pronounce their words distinctly; some letters, however, such as the initial, are usually elided, and others less frequently; but in expressions which by a general usage have assumed abridged forms, several letters are suppressed. Their accent, though irregular in some instances, does not produce a discordant effect on the ear, and their speech is so soft and gentle\u2014a pleasant contrast to that of the Najdees and I\u2019r\u00e1kees\u2014that it is open to a charge of effeminacy. In fact, it is not at all unusual to hear two men\naddressing each other in a form which is distinctly feminine; thus \n\u0641\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e\u062a\u0652 (Did you understand), \u0633\u064e\u0645\u0650\u0639\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0647\u064f (Did you hear), \u0623\u064e\u062e\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0643\u064e (Shall I inform you). In these instances, although the pro-\nnominal affixes are feminine, the sense intended is masculine,\nand a distinction is made between the two genders by the\naddition of the sound of s to the masculine and prolonging\nthe final vowel in the case of the feminine.\n\nWith the following exceptions the sounds of the letters of\nthe alphabet are generally the same as in standard Arabic:\n\n1.\u2014It would seem that the Om\u00e1nees find a difficulty in\npronouncing this letter at the beginning of a word, and,\ntherefore, resort to the simple measure of either eliding the\nletter altogether, or substituting , or s for it, thus \u0623\u064e\u062e\u0652\u062a\u064e (sister) becomes \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0650\u064a\u0645\u0652, \u0625\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0650\u064a\u0645\u0652 (Ibraheem) becomes \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0650\u064a\u0645\u0652,\netc. As instances of the substitution of the semi-vowel , and\nsilent d for l may be mentioned \u0623\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0634\u064e \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0634\u064e for \u0623\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0634\u064e (what?), thus\n\u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0634\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0643\u0652 (what is your name?); \u0623\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0646\u064e for \u0623\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e (where),\nthus \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0646\u064e \u0643\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e or \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0646\u064e \u0643\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e (whence); \u0647\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0627\u0645\u064e for \u0647\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0627\u0645\u064e\n(now a days) and \u0647\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u0643\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0627 for \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u064e (for God\u2019s sake\u2014an\nOm\u00e1nee expression used for urging expedition in an affair or\nwhen making a request). This difference, however, is more\ncolloquial, for in writing one often meets with the words\nspelt properly with the initial l, although the tendency to\nelision is great, as may be observed by expressions such as\n\u0628\u064e\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0648\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0646\u0627\u062c\u0650\u0631\u064e, \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0650 \u062d\u0627\u0644\u064e\u0643\u064e \u0644\u0634\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0641\u064e, \u0635\u062f\u064e\u0631\u062a\u064e \u0644\u0643\u064e \u0644\u0643\u062a\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064e,\n\u0648\u0639\u064e\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0635\u064e\u0648\u0644\u064e \u0633\u062a\u064e\u0648\u0627 \u0644\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0639\u064e, and others which abound in their\nletters.\n\n\u0628.\u2014This letter is pronounced as in standard Arabic; but in\nthe word \u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627, the Om\u00e1nee for \u0628\u0650 (with), it is often substituted\nby \u0648; thus \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627\u062a\u064e (who is with you), \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u064e \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627\u062a\u064e (Goodbye or\nGod be with you).\n\n\u062a.\u2014This letter is never pronounced as the cerebral t in\nEnglish, but takes more the sound of the Indian dental \u062a. I\nmake this remark, for I have heard that the people of Northern Arabia pronounced it as a hard letter like the English t.\n\n\u062c.\u2014This letter is pronounced differently in different parts of the province; it sometimes takes its normal sound of the English j, sometimes the sound of the English g in good, and at other times the sound of the Arabic \u064a. In the word \u0648\u064e\u0627\u062c\u062f (plenty, in the Om\u00e1nee dialect), however, it is invariably pronounced like \u064a. In words of a foreign origin this letter is invariably substituted for the sound of g as in good, both colloquially and in writing, thus \u062c\u064e\u0648\u0627\u062f\u0631 (Gwadur), \u062c\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064a\u0647 (Gonee, H. for a sack), \u062c\u064f\u0648\u062f\u0631\u064a (Godree, H. for a coverlet).\n\n\u062f.\u2014This letter, like \u062a, is invariably pronounced as a dental, and never as a cerebral.\n\n\u0646.\u2014Always retains its standard sound and is never pronounced as z, but is sometimes, though rarely, substituted by \u0646.\n\n\u0633 and \u0635.\u2014Although these two letters sometimes take the place of each other in writing, colloquially each one has its own standard sound.\n\n\u0634.\u2014The sound of this letter is as in standard Arabic; it is the only substitute used for \u062c, ch as in church, in foreign words; thus \u0634\u064e\u0645\u0627\u0631 (H. for a worker in leather), \u0634\u064e\u0627\u062f\u0631 (H. for a sheet).\n\n\u0636 and \u0638.\u2014The sound of these two letters being alike, they are generally confounded with each other; but the tendency of this dialect is to use \u0636 instead of \u0638 even in words of established usage; thus \u0646\u0638\u0631 (he saw), \u062d\u0641\u0638 (he preserved), are generally written with a \u0636 instead of with a \u0638 even by the educated. Instances of the substitution of \u0638 for \u0636, though rare, are, however, not wanting, thus \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0636\u0631\u0627\u0621 (the green fem.) stands for \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0636\u0631\u0627\u0621.\n\n\u0639.\u2014Initial \u0639, like initial \u0644, sometimes undergoes elision colloquially, thus \u0623\u0639\u0637\u0649 (he gave) and \u0623\u0639\u0637\u0648\u0627 (they gave) become \u0639\u0637\u064a and \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0644\u064a, whilst \u0639\u064a\u0627\u0644, when expressing the name of a\ntribe, the initial letter is invariably dropped, thus \u064a\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0648\u064e\u062c\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629\u064c, \u064a\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0628\u064f\u0648\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0639\u0650\u064a\u062f\u0650\u064a, which are evidently corruptions of \u0639\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0648\u064e\u062c\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629\u064c and \u0639\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0628\u064f\u0648\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0639\u0650\u064a\u062f\u0650\u064a.\n\n\u0642.\u2014The sound of this letter is inclined to that of \u063a, but it is not so distinctly guttural, thus \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e and \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e would be pronounced as if they were spelt with an indistinct \u063a, but towards the north this letter assumes the sound of the English j, thus \u0642\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064d is pronounced as Jasim.\n\n\u0643.\u2014Is invariably pronounced by the Om\u00e1nee Arabs as a liquid letter, and takes the sound of a combination of the English k and y.\n\nIt may be here noted that in this dialect a full \\ generally takes the place of the abbreviated \\ or \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u062a\u0636\u064a\u0629 at the end of a word, even in the case of defective verbs, thus \u062d\u062a\u0651\u0649, \u0631\u0645\u0651\u0649, \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0651\u0649, \u0639\u0644\u0649, \u0645\u062a\u064a, etc., would be written as \u062d\u062a\u0627, \u0639\u0644\u0627, \u0645\u062a\u0627, \u0646\u0648\u0648\u0627, etc.\n\nIn copying manuscripts, and sometimes in general writing, the Om\u00e1nees are in the habit of distinguishing between certain letters having the same form either by placing a single point below those that carry none, or in some cases by inserting above or below according to the letter to be distinguished, the mark \u062c, which they call \u0644\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064c, thus \u062c\u062d is distinguished by a \u0644\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064c from \u062c and \u062e, so also \u0636\u0634 from \u0636, \u0634\u0634 from \u0634, \u062d\u0637 from \u0638, and \u0639\u0639 from \u063a; whilst \u0642 and \u0631 are distinguished from \u0630 and \u062c by a point placed below each of them.\n\nOne of the remarkable features of this dialect is the frequent transposition of letters that is to be met with even in words of a purely Arabic origin. In some instances only the initial and final letters interchange places, thus \u0631\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0629 (from \u0631\u0645\u0633, he held a mighty meeting) is the Om\u00e1nee for \u0631\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0629 (from \u0633\u0645\u0631), and \u0646\u0639\u0644 often stands for \u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 (he cursed) in \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u064a\u0644\u0639\u0646\u0647, whilst \u0631\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0629, a word commonly used in Muskat for a hooka, is evidently derived from a corruption of the root \u0634\u0631\u0628; in\nother instances the transposition is irregular, thus \u062e\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0632\u0652 is the Om\u00e1nee for \u063a\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0632\u0652 (deep). In words of a foreign origin, when any transposition of letters takes place, the tendency is to an irregular one, thus in \u0634\u064f\u0628\u0652\u0631\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0629 (a cot), which is evidently a corruption of the Persian word \u0628\u0650\u062c\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0650\u0651, and \u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0651 have changed places. In the word \u0625\u0650\u062b\u0652\u0646\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u0650, the Om\u00e1nee for \u0627\u0650\u062b\u0652\u0646\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u0650 (two), we have not only an instance of transposition of letters, but also one of division of the letter \u062b into its component sounds of \u062a and \u062b. In \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0647\u0644\u0627 \u0647\u0644\u0627 for \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0647\u0644\u0627 \u0647\u0644\u0627 we have another instance of the initial and final letters changing places.\n\nAnother peculiarity of this dialect is the substitution of letters either of the same or another group, thus \u062d\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0629 (a hole) becomes \u0628\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0629, \u0628\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0629 becomes \u0628\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0629 (in Om\u00e1nee lazy), \u0642\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0637 (Mimosa Flava) becomes \u062c\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0627\u0645, \u0642\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0637 (a girdle) becomes \u062c\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0627\u0645; in \u0646\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0631 (he unfolded) and \u0645\u064e\u0635\u0652\u0631\u064e\u062d (Om\u00e1nee for a musket) \u0631 is often converted into \u0644; \u062c\u064e\u0627\u0628 (eye-brow) becomes \u062c\u064e\u0627\u062c, whilst the imperfect of \u0623\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0623 (he beckoned) becomes \u064a\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0648\u064e\u064a first by a transposition between \u0648 and \u0645 in the preterite, and subsequently by a substitution of \u0646 for \u0645. In the case of \u062c\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0627\u0645, however, it is possible that the Om\u00e1nees in adopting it have not substituted \u062a for \u0645, as the word, though rarely used in this sense now, is purely Arabic, and conveys the same meaning as \u062c\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0627\u0645. In \u0645\u064e\u062e\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0629 (Om\u00e1nee for a nose), evidently a corruption of \u0645\u064e\u062e\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0629 (a nostril), we have an instance of the substitution of \u0648 for \u0646; and in \u0643\u064e\u062f\u0652\u0641, a corruption of \u0643\u064e\u062a\u0652\u0641 (a shoulder), and \u0628\u064e\u0627\u062f\u0652\u0648\u064e\u062a, a corruption of \u0628\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0652\u0648\u062f (gunpowder), we have instances of the substitution of \u062a for \u062b. In some parts of the province \u0628\u064e\u0644\u064e\u062f (a country, a village) is written and pronounced as \u0628\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u062a, whilst \u0628\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0629 (the generally adopted way of spelling the name of the town of \u0628\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0629 by the Om\u00e1nees) is sometimes both pronounced and written as \u0628\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0629. In some instances the substitution is one of sounds, and therefore only colloquial, thus \u062f in \u0628, in such expressions as\ntakes sometimes the sound of \u0648, as o in old, with a slight reduplication of \u0628. Similarly in certain proper names, as will be noticed hereafter, the final \u0629 is generally pronounced as \u0648, thus \u062e\u0648\u0628\u064a\u062c\u0629 would be pronounced as Khadeejo.\n\nBeside the initial \u0644 other letters are sometimes elided both colloquially and in writing, thus \u0648\u0644\u062f (son) in composition is almost invariably pronounced and written as \u0648\u062f, for instance \u0627\u0631\u062f\u062a \u0648\u062c\u062f\u062a; \u062e\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u062f \u0631\u0628\u064a\u0639 (I found) and (I desired) are sometimes met with written as \u0648\u062c\u062f\u062a and \u0627\u0631\u062a, whilst colloquially the \u0648 in \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f\u0647 (one) and the initial \u0646 in \u0646\u062d\u0646\u0648 (Omanee form for we) are generally elided.\n\nThe following are some of the abridged expressions in general use in which more than one letter is elided:\n\n| English                  | Long Form                        | Abridged Form |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------|\n| Good morning             | \u0635\u0628\u062d \u0627\u0644\u062e\u064a\u0631                       | \u0635\u0628\u062d\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062e\u064a\u0631 |\n| Good evening             | \u0645\u0633\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u064a\u0631                       | \u0645\u0633\u0627\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062e\u064a\u0631 |\n| Good evening             | \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0643 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062e\u064a\u0631                    | \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062e\u064a\u0631 |\n| How do you (in the evening) | \u0643\u064a\u0641 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u062a                     | \u0643\u064a\u0641 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u062a     |\n| How do you do (in the morning) | \u0643\u064a\u0641 \u0645\u0628\u0643\u062b\u062a                   | \u0643\u064a\u0641 \u0645\u0628\u0643\u062b\u062a     |\n\nThe letter \u0629 or \u062a\u0627 \u0645\u0631\u0628\u0648\u0637\u0647 is occasionally found written as \u062a\u0627 \u0645\u0628\u0633\u0637\u0647 or \u062a\u0627 \u0645\u0628\u0633\u0637\u0647 \u062a, thus we have \u0645\u0628\u0633\u0637\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0633 instead of \u0645\u0628\u0633\u0637\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0633.\n\nAmong other peculiarities of this dialect may be mentioned the tendency that exists to the use of long vowels, as in ancient Arabic, in the place of short ones, but without affecting the pronunciation; thus we sometimes meet with \u0646\u062d\u0646\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0646\u0627 \u0644\u0632\u0646\u062c\u0628\u0627\u0631, \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0643, \u0627\u0630\u0627\u0643\u0627\u0646, \u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0646\u062d\u0646 written as \u0646\u062d\u0646\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0646\u0627 \u0644\u0632\u0646\u062c\u0628\u0627\u0631, \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0643, \u0627\u0630\u0627\u0643\u0627\u0646, \u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0646\u062d\u0646 or \u0627\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0646\u0627 \u0644\u064a \u0632\u0646\u062c\u0628\u0627\u0631, \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0643, \u0627\u0630\u0627\u0643\u0627\u0646, \u0627\u064a\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646, and \u0627\u064a\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646.\n\nConsidering the state of education in the province it is not a matter of wonder that vowels sometimes undergo most unexpected changes; the vowel points as a rule are never expressed in writing, but even colloquially all the three\nvowels undergo the process of substitution; thus in the expression \u0628\u064f\u062e\u0650\u064a\u0631 (well) it is evident that the dammah of \u0628 has transplaced its kasrah: in the like manner \u062a\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0646 (who) becomes \u0645\u064e\u0627, \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627 (what) becomes \u0645\u064f\u0648, \u0645\u064f\u0648 (all, every) becomes \u0643\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651, \u0643\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651 (thus) becomes \u0643\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0627, \u0643\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0627 becomes \u0643\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0629 (hair), and \u0643\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0645 (words) becomes sometimes \u0643\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0645. In words with an initial \u0643, however, the substitution of a kasrah for a dammah or a fatha may partly be attributed to the liquid sound of that letter in this dialect, a sound which can more easily adapt itself to a kasrah than to either of the other two vowels. But great as the tendency to this kind of substitution of vowels, particularly in the case of the verb and its derived forms, exists, we rarely find the educated using forms such as \u0644\u064e\u0627\u0632\u064e\u0645 and \u0633\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u0645 for \u0644\u064e\u0627\u0632\u064e\u0645 and \u0633\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u0645, although they are not uncommon in the mouths of the illiterate.\n\nThe reduplication of letters, particularly in instances where an intervening vowel is dropped, is another remarkable feature of this dialect; thus \u062c\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f, \u062c\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f, would be pronounced as \u062c\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f, \u062c\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f, in which the intervening dammah of the \u062a having been dropped, the \u0644 of \u0644\u064f has been doubled, and the final s has assumed the sound of English o, as in old. In such instances it is evident that, primarily, abbreviation for colloquial purposes is aimed at by dropping the intervening vowel, and a reduplication of the following consonant takes place by an operation of the natural law of euphony. But there is a great tendency observable in the dialect to the adoption of forms with a tashdeed where both tashdeed and non-tashdeed forms are admissible; thus the causal form of verbs, irrespective of their being transitive or intransitive, is invariably the measure of the second conjugation \u0646\u064e\u0632\u0644, for instance \u0646\u064e\u0632\u0644 (he descended) becomes \u0646\u064e\u0632\u0644 and \u0646\u064e\u0632\u0644 (he had or possessed knowledge) becomes in the causal \u0646\u064e\u0632\u0644. In the perfect tense form of verbs, adopted\nfrom the emphatic form of the standard Arabic, the \u0646 is invariably doubled, as \u064a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0647\u064f (who has sent him, or it?), \u064a\u064e\u062c\u0652\u0644\u0650\u0628\u064e\u0647\u064f (who has brought it?). But a still more remarkable use of the tashdeed occurs in words like \u0631\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064c (a man).\n\nIn addition to these peculiarities in the use of the vowels, it may be here mentioned that in conversation, especially in interrogatory sentences, the people of Oman are in the habit of using either a long or a short kasrah vowel after proper names of persons and places, particularly in cases where the person addressing directly answers his or her own question; thus \u064a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0645\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0646\u064d (where do you come from, Muskat?), \u064a\u064e\u062c\u0652\u0644\u0650\u0628\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064d (who beat you, Muhammad?), \u064a\u064e\u062c\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0641\u064e\u0627\u0637\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0629\u064d (who came with you, Fatimah?). The final syllable of such female proper names as end in \u0629, such as \u062e\u064e\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0629\u064c, \u062e\u064e\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0652\u062c\u064e\u0629\u064c, \u0633\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064e\u0629\u064c, etc., takes generally the sound of the English o as in old, but this is more a pet and familiar way of calling, and, although an instance of the substitution of the sound of \u0629 for \u0629, can hardly be looked upon as a dialectical peculiarity. Similarly in nouns derived from triliteral verbs with a medial radical \u0648, the fathah of the initial letter is converted into a dammah, whilst the jazmeh of the second letter, which is \u0648, is retained, giving the syllable the sound of o as in robe; thus \u062b\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0628\u064c (a garment), \u062b\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0645\u064c (a fast), \u062b\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0645\u064c (a body of men), \u062b\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0631\u064c (a bullock), etc., instead of being pronounced as \u062b\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0628\u064c, \u062b\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0645\u064c, \u062b\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0645\u064c, \u062b\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0631\u064c, etc., are pronounced as \u062b\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0628\u064c (thobe), \u062b\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0645\u064c (some), \u062b\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0645\u064c (kome), \u062b\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0631\u064c (thore); the aorist of the verb \u0623\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0645\u064e (Om\u00e1nee, he was able) takes also a similar sound in the second syllable, thus \u064a\u064e\u0623\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0645\u064e becomes \u064a\u064e\u0623\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0645\u064e (yarome).\n\nAs in standard Arabic, the usual method of rendering masculine nouns feminine is by the addition of \u0629, but this rule is so extensively applied in this dialect as to include also nouns of the form \u0646\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0644\u064c, \u0646\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0644\u064c, \u0646\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0644\u064c, and \u0646\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0644\u064c in the sense of\n\u060c thus \u0642\u064e\u062a\u0650\u064a\u0644\u064e\u0629\u064c\u060c \u0633\u064e\u0643\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064c\u060c \u0635\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648\u0631\u064e\u0629\u064c\u060c and \u0645\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0639\u064f\u0648\u0644\u064e\u0629\u064c would also follow the general rule and become in the feminine \u0633\u064e\u0643\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064c\u060c \u0635\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648\u0631\u064e\u0629\u064c\u060c and \u0642\u064e\u062a\u0650\u064a\u0644\u064e\u0629\u064c. The adjectival form \u0623\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u060c expressive of degrees of comparison, undergoes no change whatever, and is the same in both the genders, whilst the form \u0646\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0649\u060c descriptive of colour or deformity, sometimes takes the form \u0646\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0649 without the prolongation of the last vowel, and sometimes retains the original form in the feminine. Excepting the above instances and the names of winds, which are generally expressed as masculine, there is no marked deviation from the standard rules.\n\nThe case terminations of nouns as a rule are omitted both colloquially and in writing, and even the additional \u0644 necessary to express the fat\u1e25ah tanween of the objective case is never expressed. The words \u0623\u064e\u0628\u064c (father) etc., and \u0623\u064e\u062e\u064c (brother) are always written and pronounced as \u0623\u064e\u0628\u064c\u0648 and \u0623\u064e\u062e\u064c\u0648, sometimes with the initial \u0644 elided, and undergo no ultimate vowel change either in declension or in construction with a pronominal affix. The words \u0645\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064c and \u062e\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064c are often used in government with nouns to express the Genitive or Dependent case; thus \u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062a\u064f \u0645\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u0647\u0650 (the house of so and so), \u062e\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0622\u062a\u064e\u062a\u0652 (yours or for you).\n\nThe dual number is not always expressed by a regular form, the word \u062b\u064e\u0646\u064e\u064a\u0646\u064c (two) being added to the plural to express the duality; such instances are, however, rare; but when the dual form is used, it is invariably \u064a\u064e\u0646\u0652\u060c irrespective of the case of the noun, and of the standard exceptions to the general grammatical rules; this is more from a disregard to euphony than an actual breach of the rules of grammar; thus \u0639\u064e\u0635\u064e\u0627 (a stick) and \u0643\u0650\u0633\u064e\u0627 (a dress, clothes) become in the dual \u0639\u064e\u0635\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e and \u0643\u0650\u0633\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e.\n\nThe Om\u00e1nee dialect makes no distinction between the plural of paucity and that of multitude, and as a general rule only\nthe latter is used. The plural of the regular masculine nouns is formed by the addition of \u064a\u0646 irrespective of the case of the noun, that is to say, in the subjective case also the form instead of being \u0648\u0648\u0646 is \u064a\u0646; thus we have \u0646\u0627\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0646, \u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645\u0648\u064a\u0646 instead of \u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0646 and \u0646\u0627\u0631\u0628\u0648\u0646 in the subjective case. The broken plurals present a great variety of forms as in standard Arabic, and generally follow the usually adopted rules of grammar, but several instances of departure from them are occasionally met with. No definite rules can, however, be laid down as regards these exceptions, some of which are noted down here, and others may be found by a reference to Part II. of this paper. The verbal noun denoting occupation of the measure \u0641\u0639\u0627\u0644 invariably makes its plural in \u0641\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644, whilst other nouns indicating the same sense, but not of the same measure, also make their plural in \u0641\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644; so also nouns with the second radical reduplicated. Two of the commonest forms used in the formation of broken plurals are \u0641\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646 and \u0641\u0639\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0646, and it sometimes occurs that a word having taken either of these forms undergoes a second plural formation; thus we have \u0641\u064a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0646 and \u0644\u064a\u0645\u0627\u062c\u064a\u0646 as the plurals of \u0641\u0627\u0631 (a mouse) and \u0644\u0648\u062d (a plank), the first plurals according to this dialect being \u0641\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646 and \u0644\u064a\u062d\u0627\u0646.\n\nThe plural of feminine nouns ending in \u0629, as in standard Arabic, is formed in several ways, as may be seen from the table given below, and by a reference to Part II.; but when the noun is regular, the plural is generally of the measure \u062a\u0641\u0627\u0639\u0627\u0644\u062a or \u062a\u0641\u0627\u0639\u0644\u0627\u062a, which method of rendering feminine nouns plural is not restricted to nouns ending in \u0629 only, but is also applied to nouns with a final \u0629; thus \u062d\u0644\u0648\u064a or \u062d\u0644\u0648\u0627 (halwa, a sweetmeat), \u062d\u0643\u0627 (a stone), and \u0643\u0631\u064a (a fare) become in the plural \u062d\u0644\u0648\u064a\u0627\u062a, \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a, and \u0643\u0631\u064a\u0627\u062a, as if the words are taken in a collective sense and have for their singulars \u062d\u0644\u0648\u064a\u0647, \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0647, and \u0643\u0631\u064a\u0647.\n### Broken plurals of feminine nouns ending in \u0629:\n\n| Singular | Plural | Plural Measure

In nouns of more than three letters, some words such as \u064a\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0633\u064f\u0641, \u064a\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0633\u064f\u0641, \u064a\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0633\u064f\u0641, instead of taking a kasr\u0101h after the quiescent \u064a, take a damm\u0101h over the following letter, thus \u064a\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0633\u064f\u0641, \u064a\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0633\u064f\u0641, \u064a\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0633\u064f\u0641; whilst nouns with the termination \u0623\u064e\u0646, instead of retaining it in the diminutive, are subject to the general rule of kasrating the letter after the quiescent \u064a, thus \u0633\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064c and \u0633\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064c become in the diminutive \u0633\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064c and \u0633\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064c instead of becoming \u0633\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064c in the diminutive, becomes \u0646\u064e\u0645\u064c, \u0646\u064e\u0645\u064c, \u0646\u064e\u0645\u064c and \u0646\u064e\u0645\u064c become \u062f\u064e\u0645\u064c, \u062f\u064e\u0645\u064c, \u062f\u064e\u0645\u064c in the diminutive, which seems to be the form adopted for all biliteral words generally; \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0636\u064d becomes \u062a\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0646\u0650\u064a notwithstanding the standard rule of not restoring the dropped radical in the diminutive. The diminutive of compound words is formed according to the\nstandard rules of grammar, excepting in the matter of the initial vowel, which in the diminutive is invariably a kasrah.\n\nThe separate personal pronouns are the same as in standard Arabic excepting in the following respects:\n\nThe first person plural \u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 is more generally pronounced and written as \u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652, \u0647\u064f\u0646\u0652 or \u0647\u064f\u0646\u0652\u0627; the second person feminine singular generally takes a \u064a at its end instead of a simple kasrah, thus \u0623\u0646\u062a\u064a or \u0623\u0646\u062a\u064a and in the second person masculine plural, the final \u0645 is invariably elided, the dammah of \u062a being prolonged into a \u0648, thus \u0625\u0646\u062a\u0648 \u0623\u0648 \u0623\u0646\u062a\u0648, whilst the dammah of the \u062a in the second person feminine plural is converted into a fatha, \u0623\u0646\u062a\u064a\u0646, the final letter losing its shaddeh; and the dammah of the \u0633 in the third person feminine plural is converted into a kasrah \u0647\u0646, the shaddeh of the final letter being dropped. The two last-named pronouns, \u0623\u0646\u062a\u064a\u0646 and \u0647\u0646, are sometimes not used by the vulgar, their places being taken by their respective masculine forms. The dual number is never employed, the plural being substituted for it.\n\n**Separate Personal Pronouns.**\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| Masculine | Common | Feminine | Masculine | Common | Feminine |\n| 3rd P.   | \u0647\u0648     | \u0647\u064a     | \u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652     | \u0647\u064a     | \u0647\u064f\u0646\u0652     |\n| 2nd P.   | \u0623\u0646\u062a    | \u0623\u0646\u062a\u064a   | \u0623\u0646\u062a\u0648    | \u0623\u0646\u062a\u064a   | \u0623\u0646\u062a\u064a\u0646   |\n| 1st P.   | \u0623\u0646\u0627     | \u0623\u0646\u0627     | \u0623\u0646\u0627      | \u0623\u0646\u0627     | \u0623\u0646\u0627      |\n\nIn the case of affixed pronouns the invariable substitution of \u0634 for \u0643\u0628 the sign of the second person feminine singular, strikes as a remarkable peculiarity of this dialect, but is not restricted to it alone, for a similar substitution occurs in the dialects of Benoo 'Amr and Temeen (Lane, Art. \u0634). It\nmay be an abbreviation of \u0643\u0634 or \u0643\u0634 sometimes employed in place of the affixed pronoun \u0643 in the second person feminine as \u0639\u064e\u062f\u0652\u064a\u0650\u0643\u0634 (above thee) for \u0639\u064e\u062f\u0652\u064a\u0650\u0643\u0634 (Johnson's Arabic and English Dictionary); but it is certain that it is not a mere example of the substitution of letters. The duals of these pronominal signs as in the case of the pronouns themselves are expressed by their respective plurals, the feminine plurals of the second and third person are sometimes expressed by their respective masculine forms.\n\n**Signs of Affixed Pronouns.**\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| Masculine | Common | Feminine | Masculine | Common | Feminine |\n| 3rd P. | \u0643\u0627 | \u0643\u0627 | \u0643\u0645 | \u0643\u0645 | \u0643\u0645 |\n| 2nd P. | \u0643\u0643 | \u0643\u0643 | \u0643\u0645 | \u0643\u0645 | \u0643\u0645 |\n| 1st P. | \u064a | \u064a | \u0646\u0627 | \u0646\u0627 | \u0646\u0627 |\n\nThese pronominal affixes are sometimes joined to the adverbs \u0648\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e or \u0645\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e (for \u0623\u064a\u064e\u0646\u064e, where), \u0628\u064e\u063a\u064e\u062f\u064e (yet, not yet), and \u063a\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e (why, for \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0648), and convey the sense of the pronominal agent; thus \u0648\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0643\u064e (where are you?), \u0645\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0647\u0627 (where is she?), \u0645\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0647\u0645 (where are they?), etc., \u0644\u0627 \u0628\u064e\u063a\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0646\u064a (no, I have not yet), \u0628\u064e\u063a\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0647\u064f (he has not yet), etc.; in this sense \u0628\u064e\u063a\u064e\u062f\u064e is sometimes employed in a plural form, thus in answer to a question \u062c\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e (have they come?) one may hear \u0644\u0627 \u0628\u064e\u063a\u064e\u062f\u064e\u064a\u0646\u064e (no, they have not yet), \u063a\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e\u0643\u064e (why did you?), \u063a\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e\u0634\u064e (why did you, fem.?).\n\nWhen nouns ending in \u0629 take these pronominal affixes, the final radical is invariably quiescent if the affix is composed of only one letter; but if it consists of two letters, the final radical generally takes a kasrah, the \u0629 instead becoming quiescent; thus \u062d\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0629\u064c\u0643\u064e (his woman or wife), \u062d\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0645\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0643\u064e (your work), \u0645\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0641\u064e\u062a\u064e\u064a\u0650 (my knowledge), \u062d\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0645\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0646\u0627 (our woman), \u062d\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0645\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 (their work), \u0645\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0641\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627 (her knowledge).\n\nThe employment of separate personal pronouns in con-\njunction with the affixed ones is another peculiar feature of this dialect. This is done sometimes with the object of giving emphasis, but it is also very often met with in instances where no such emphasis is needed; thus \u064a\u064f\u0648\u0645\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0646\u062a\u064e \u062a\u064e\u062f\u0652\u062e\u064f\u0644\u064f \u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062a\u064e \u0645\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u064a \u0622\u0646\u064e\u0627 (when you enter my house), \u0623\u064e\u0646\u062a\u064e \u0636\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062a\u0650\u064a (you struck me), \u0622\u0644\u064e\u0628\u064e\u064a\u062a\u064e \u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0643\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0643\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0646\u062a\u064e (for you, for your sake), \u0622\u0644\u064e\u0628\u064e\u064a\u062a\u064e \u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0643\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0643\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0646\u062a\u064e (the house is yours).\n\nThe demonstrative pronouns are as follows:\n\n| Singular | Feminine | Common Gender |\n|----------|----------|---------------|\n| \u0647\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627     | \u0647\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a    | \u0647\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e      |\n| \u0647\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627     | \u0647\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a    | \u0647\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e      |\n| \u0647\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627     | \u0647\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a    | \u0647\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e      |\n\nThe initial \u0621 is sometimes altogether omitted, and as these pronouns are never declined, the case has to be understood by the context. In writing the standard forms masculine \u0630\u064e\u0644\u0643\u064e and feminine \u0630\u064e\u0644\u0643\u064e\u0629\u064b (that) are sometimes used. In addition to these may be mentioned as demonstrative pronouns \u0643\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627 (this here) and \u0643\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627 (that there, or lo there), which are evidently abbreviations of \u0643\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627.\n\nThe relative pronoun in the colloquial is generally \u0628\u064f\u0648, an abbreviation of \u0628\u064e\u0648\u0652; it is never declined, and sometimes even the correlative pronoun to express the antecedent is omitted after it; \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0650\u062a\u0627\u0628\u064f \u0628\u064f\u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u062a\u064e \u0623\u064e\u062e\u0652\u0637\u064e\u064a\u064e\u062a\u0650\u064a (the book you gave me), \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0650\u064a\u0644\u064f \u0628\u064f\u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u062a\u064e \u0635\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062a\u0650\u0643\u064e (the men who struck you), \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0627\u062a\u064f \u0628\u064f\u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u062a\u064e \u0646\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0645\u064e\u062a\u0650\u0647\u0646\u064e\u0651 (the woman you called). The employment of this monosyllable to express the sense of relation may be easily accounted for by the sense of possession conveyed by the original word \u0628\u064e\u0648\u0652, and is an analogous instance of a similar application of \u062f\u064e\u0648\u0652 by \"some of the Arabs, especially the tribe of Tayyi\" (Wright's Grammar). In writing, however, the only relative pronoun used is masculine \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0630\u0650\u064a, feminine \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0630\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0629\u064c, which is rarely declined either for case or number, the plural, especially where the antecedent is a broken plural,\nbeing sometimes expressed by the feminine form, but, unlike the case of \u064a\u064f\u0648, when this pronoun occurs in construction, the correlative pronoun referring to the antecedent is generally expressed; thus \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062c\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0623\u0646\u062a \u0633\u0642\u064a\u062a\u0647 (the trees you watered).\n\nOf the other relative pronouns \u0645\u0646 is invariably converted into \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0646, and \u0645\u0627 into \u0645\u064e\u0648\u0652, which forms they retain also as interrogatives; their use, however, as relatives is limited, both of them being generally substituted by \u064a\u064f\u0648. Examples as relatives: \u062e\u0644\u064a \u064a\u062f\u062e\u0644 \u064a\u0648 (for \u064a\u0648 \u064a\u0628\u0643\u064a) (let him enter whoever wants), \u062a\u0633\u0645\u0639 \u064a\u0648 \u064a\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0644\u0643 (for \u064a\u0648 \u064a\u0642\u0644 \u0644\u064a) (do you hear what he says to you?), \u064a\u0648 \u062a\u063a\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0623\u062e\u0630 (for \u064a\u0648 \u062a\u063a\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0623\u062e\u0630) (I shall take what you give me). Examples as interrogatives: \u0648\u064e\u0645\u0646 \u062c\u0627\u0621 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u0628 (who came to the door?), \u0643\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u062a \u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0648\u064e\u0645\u0646 (whose house is this?), \u0645\u064e\u0648\u0652 \u062a\u0628\u0643\u064a (what is your name?), \u0645\u064e\u0648\u0652 \u0625\u0634\u062a\u0643 (what do you want?).\n\n\u0623\u064a, sometimes converted into \u0643\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646, is also used both as a relative and an interrogative, but is never declined, and retains the same form for both genders; thus \u0643\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u062a\u0628\u063a\u0649 (which book do you want?), \u0643\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646 \u0631\u062c\u0644 \u062c\u0627\u064a (which man has come?), \u0643\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646 \u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0633\u064a\u0631\u0627 \u062c\u064a \u0648\u064a\u0627\u0643 (whatever place you go to, I shall come with you).\n\nOwing to the general practice of eliding the initial \u0644, the article \u0622\u0644 often loses its prosthetic \u0644, the demonstrative letter \u0644 being retained in its position; thus \u0643\u064e\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a (the valley), \u0644\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0637\u0627\u0644\u064a (the shaded), \u0644\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0628\u0627 (the mangoe). In some instances where the article conveys the sense of this or the present one, it is pronounced as \u0643\u0644, thus in \u0622\u0644\u0622\u064a\u0627\u0645 (now a days), \u0622\u0644\u0622\u0646\u0627\u0639\u0629 (just now), \u0622\u0644\u062a\u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646 (this place), the initial \u0644 would take the sound of s.\n\nIn the employment of adjectives, both separately and in construction, the usual rules of grammar are observed, but in the colloquial the article of the qualified noun, when the sense\nis definite is generally omitted, whilst the article of the adjective is retained, thus \u062d\u064f\u0648\u0652\u0636 \u0622\u0644\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0631 (the big tank), \u0631\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0627\u0644 \u0622\u0644\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064e\u062f (the big man), whilst in some instances, even in writing, the usual rule of adjectives following nouns which they qualify, is transgressed, thus \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0637\u064e\u0639\u064e \u0622\u0644\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064e \u0643\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064e\u0643\u064e (do not cease sending your kind letter, or do not cease writing), \u0648\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0645\u064e \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0637\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0622\u0644\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064e \u0643\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064e\u0643\u064e (in which \u062a\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0637\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 evidently \u062a\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0637\u064e\u0639\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649, never cease writing to us).\n\nThe comparative degree generally takes the particle \u0639\u064e\u0646 instead of \u0645\u0650\u0646, thus \u0623\u064e\u062e\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0649 \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064f (better than he).\n\nWith the following exceptions the numerals are the same as in standard Arabic. No distinction of gender is generally made, one form serving for both genders in most cases:\n\n1. \u0648\u064e\u0627\u062d\u0650\u062f generally with the last letter \u062f elided giving it the sound of \u0648\u064e\u0627\u062d\u0650\u064a\n2. \u062b\u064e\u0646\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646 sometimes \u0647\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0646\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\n8. \u062b\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0647\n11. \u062c\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0631\n12. \u0644\u064e\u062b\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0631\n13. \u062b\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0634\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0631 the second \u062b takes the sound \u062a and is doubled\n14. \u0631\u064e\u062b\u064e\u063a\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0631\n18. \u062b\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0631\n\nFrom 20 upwards all the tens take the form of the oblique case in \u064a\u064e\u0646 even in the subjective, thus \u062e\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0633\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0631\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e (fifty men).\n\n100. \u0648\u064e\u0645\u0650\u0626\u0629\n200. \u0648\u064e\u0645\u0650\u0626\u064e\u062a\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\n300. \u062b\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u062b\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0645\u0650\u0626\u0629\n800. \u062b\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651 \u0648\u064e\u0645\u0650\u0626\u0629\n8000. \u062b\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064e \u0622\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0641\n100000. \u0623\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0641\u064e (from H. \u0623\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0647) plural \u0644\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0648\u0643\nThe indefinite multiplicate plural of \u0644\u064e\u0643\u0652\u0646\u064f is \u0646\u064f\u0643\u0652\u0648\u064f\u0643\u0652 on the model of \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0641\u0652, whilst that of \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0651 is \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0627\u062a\u064e\u0651.\n\nThe mode of writing figures up to ten, excepting in the case of 5 and 6, is the same as in standard Arabic. Five is expressed by \u0665 or \u0668, and six by \u0667. All figures above ten and up to ninety-nine take a dot expressive of ten between the figure of unit and the figure of ten, thus twenty-five is \u0662\u0665; whilst hundreds, thousands, etc., are expressed in words; thus \u0661\u0662\u0665 = \u0661\u0662\u0665 \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0651 ; \u0664\u0663\u0662\u0666 = \u0664\u0663\u0662\u0666 \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0651.\n\nThe ordinal numbers are first = \u062d\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u064a\u064c and the subsequent numbers up to tenth as in standard Arabic, but the sense of the following numbers is generally expressed by cardinal numbers, sometimes with the addition of words explanatory of its nature; thus this is the fifteenth day of the month would be expressed by \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u062e\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0633\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0634\u0631\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0631\u064e, I want the fifteenth by \u0623\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062a\u064f \u0628\u064f\u062e\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0633\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0634\u0631\u064e.\n\nFractions above fourth, with the exception of eighth \u0646\u064f\u0643\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0645\u0652 are generally expressed by the expression \u2018a part from so many parts,\u2019 \u0633\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u0633\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0645\u0652, but when a regular form is used, it is of the measure of \u0641\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0644\u0652, thus a fifth would be expressed by \u0633\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u0633\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u062e\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0629\u064e \u0622\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0631\u064e, or by \u062e\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0647\u064f, but above \u201ctenth\u201d the fraction is invariably expressed by \u201ca part from \u2014 parts,\u201d the word \u062c\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0621\u064f of the standard being substituted by \u0633\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0645\u0652.\n\nApproximate numbers are expressed by the addition of \u0642\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0631\u0652 or \u064a\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0648\u0652 \u0642\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0631\u0652, thus \u2018give him about twenty\u2019 would be \u0623\u064e\u063a\u0652\u0637\u0650\u064a\u0647\u0650 \u0628\u064e\u0642\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0631\u0652 \u0642\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0631\u0652 or \u0623\u064e\u063a\u0652\u0637\u0650\u064a\u0647\u0650 \u0628\u064e\u0642\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0631\u0652 \u0642\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0631\u0652 or \u0623\u064e\u063a\u0652\u0637\u0650\u064a\u0647\u0650 \u0628\u064e\u0642\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0631\u0652 \u0642\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0631\u0652. Alternate is expressed by \u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0643\u0652, thus \u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0643\u0652 \u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0643\u0652 \u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0643\u0652 (every other), but every alternate day would be expressed by \u064a\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0645\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0622\u064e \u064a\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0645\u064e. At, meaning at the rate of, is invariably expressed by \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649, thus \u0623\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0625\u0650\u0634\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u062a\u0652\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0623\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064e \u062a\u064f\u0648\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0634\u064f (I bought them at the rate of four dollars each).\n\nIn the Om\u00e1nee dialect no part of speech presents such a number and variety of deviations from standard rules as the verb. The tendency so peculiar to the Arabic language of\ncurtailing words and expressions, and of conveying sense in a compact manner, exists in an exaggerated form in this dialect, and although it is true that the accent undergoes a considerable modification owing to the transposition or change of some of the vowels and elision of others, still the sound to an accustomed ear is neither harsh nor unpleasant.\n\nIn the preterite tense of the active voice the second radical of the third person singular is pronounced generally either with a fat\u1e25ah or with a \u1e0dammah irrespective of the transitive or intransitive nature of the verb; thus \u062e\u064e\u0633\u0650\u0628\u064e (he thought), \u063a\u064e\u0637\u064e\u0634\u064e (he thirsted), \u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0645\u064e (he knew), \u062c\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0633\u064e (he sat) and \u0631\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0628\u064e (he mounted); but the last verb sometimes, though rarely, takes a \u1e33asra\u1e25 for its middle radical. In the third person feminine singular the second radical is invariably quiescent, whilst the third radical is invariably \u1e25asrated, thus \u062c\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0633\u064e\u062a\u0652 (she sat), \u0631\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062a\u0652 (she mounted), \u0636\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062a\u0652 (she struck); the final letter \u062a\u064f of the second person feminine singular generally takes a long \u1e25asrated vowel as \u062a\u0650\u064a, thus \u0636\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062a\u0650\u064a (thou feminine struckest); whilst the final letter \u062a\u064f of the first person singular is invariably unpointed, a distinction between it and the second person masculine singular, which is also sometimes unpointed, being shown by the separate pronoun expressive of the agent, which generally accompanies the verb. In the third person plural both in the masculine and the feminine, the second radical is invariably quiescent; whilst in the second person plural the final \u0645\u064f of the masculine is invariably elided, the \u1e0dammah of the preceding \u062a\u064f being prolonged into \u0648\u0662; and the pronominal affix of the feminine takes a form analogous to the two final letters of the corresponding separate pronoun \u0622\u0646\u064e\u064a.\n\nIn the aorist of the active voice the middle radical may take any of the three vowels without affecting the sense of the verb, whilst the vowel of the pronominal prefix is generally determined by the vowel of the middle radical of the third\nperson singular masculine; thus in the verb \u0643\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0651 the third person singular masculine in the aorist being \u064a\u064f\u0643\u064e\u0628\u0650\u0651 the pronominal prefixes \u064a\u0650, \u062f\u0650, \u0648\u0650 would all take a kasrah; this rule, however, does not hold good with regard to verbs having a medial s, such as \u064a\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0645\u0652 (he called), in which the aorist is \u064a\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0645\u0652 instead of being \u064a\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0645\u0652. In this tense the final \u0646\u0650 of the third and second persons plural masculine is invariably apocopated, whilst the middle radical in both the genders is rendered quiescent, its vowel being transferred to the first radical. In the first person singular the pronominal prefix is not affected by the vowel of the middle radical, but invariably takes a fatha. In triliteral verbs with a medial s the pronominal prefix, excepting in the first person singular, is invariably karsrated, although the vowel of the aorist may be a fatha.\n\nAs in the case of substantives the dual is generally expressed by the plural form, thus \u0643\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u062c\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0636\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0646\u0650\u064a or \u0643\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u062c\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0636\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0646\u0650\u064a (these two (men) struck me). The third and second person feminine plural forms, both in the preterite and aorist are sometimes, though rarely, ignored in use, their places being then taken by the corresponding masculine forms.\n\nThe future tense, when not sufficiently expressed by the aorist, is indicated by prefixing the letter \u0628\u0650 or \u062d\u0650 to the aorist, the vowel of the pronominal prefix being in that case converted into a fatha or rendered quiescent; thus \u064a\u064f\u0643\u064e\u0628\u0650\u0651 (he will write), \u0628\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0641\u064e (we shall see), \u062d\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0651\u062c\u0650\u064a (he will come), also spelt as \u062d\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0651\u062c\u0650\u064a.\n\nThe Imperative never takes the short prosthetic vowel hamzet-ul-wasl either in writing or colloquially, which peculiarity is common to most of the modern colloquial dialects of Arabic; in this dialect, however, the vowel of the hamzet-ul-wasl is retained, being transferred to the first radical; thus \u063a\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0628\u0652 is the imperative of \u063a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0652 (he struck), the dammah of the prosthetic l of the standard imperative \u0623\u064e\u063a\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0628\u0652\nbeing transferred to the first radical. The vowel of the imperative is, however, not always determined by the vowel of the aorist as in standard Arabic, thus \u0631\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0628\u064e (he mounted), aor. \u064a\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0643\u0650\u0628\u064f has for its imperative \u0631\u064e\u0643\u0650\u0628\u064e instead of \u064a\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0643\u0650\u0628\u064e by the standard rule. In the third and first persons the imperative is generally expressed by the imperative of the verb \u062e\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u064a\u064e with the pronominal affix added, thus \u062e\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u064a\u0652\u0646\u0650\u064a \u0623\u064e\u062c\u0650\u064a\u064e (let me come), \u062e\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650 \u0623\u064e\u062c\u0650\u064a\u064e (let him come), but come let us go (that is to say together) would be expressed by \u062e\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0633\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064f. Of the verbs which in the standard Arabic altogether reject the prosthetic hamzeh in the imperative, \u0623\u064e\u062e\u064e\u0630\u064e (he took) forms its imperative as \u0623\u064e\u062e\u064e\u0630\u064e (sometimes expressed as masculine \u0630\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0643\u064e, feminine \u0630\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0634\u064e), \u0623\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0644\u064e (he ate) as \u0643\u064e\u0644\u064e, instead of \u0643\u064e\u0644\u064e, whilst \u0623\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0631\u064e (he ordered) retains the \u0627, and instead of becoming \u0645\u064e\u0631\u064e is \u0645\u064e\u0631\u064f in the imperative.\n\nBoth colloquially and in writing the passive voice (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0648\u0644) is rarely used, but in reciting verses from the Koran, or citing poetry, it is invariably and properly expressed.\n\nThe Omanees rarely or very seldom use any vowel points in writing, and colloquially there are such variations in the speech of different persons that it is very difficult to formulate any regular form of inflexion with precision; but an attempt is here made to give a general outline of the different kinds of inflexions most commonly in use. As the passive voice is not in use, only the active voice is given; the dual form also not being in use is not shown.\n\n\u0636\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e = he struck.\n\nPreterite.\n\n| Plural | Singular |\n|--------|----------|\n| Feminine | Common | Masculine |\n| \u0636\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0646\u064e | \u0636\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062a\u064f | \u0636\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e 3rd P. |\n| \u0636\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648 | \u0636\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062a\u064f | \u0636\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e 2nd P. |\n| \u0636\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0633\u064e | \u0636\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062a\u064f | \u0636\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e 1st P. |\n\n\u0636\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0646\u0627\nAorist.\n\nPlural.

The third conjugation \u0641\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0644 is also commonly used for rendering intransitive verbs transitive without con-\nveying any direct sense of reciprocity, thus \u0641\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0646\u064e \u064a\u064e\u062e\u064e\u0627\u0637\u0650\u0628\u064f\u0646\u0650\u064a (so and so is at enmity with me), \u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0627\u0628\u0650\u062a\u064e\u0646\u0650\u064a (he accompanied me), \u0646\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0650\u0639\u064f\u0647\u064f \u0623\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0647\u064f (we referred the matter to him), \u062d\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0647\u064f (he talked with him with a view to gain him over), \u0622\u064e\u062a\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e\u0641\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u0650\u064a (do not disobey my order). A great diversity exists in the use of the 7th \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e and 8th \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e conjugations, which, although nearly allied to each other in sense, are by common usage only distinguished by their applicability to certain roots; thus whilst \u0633\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0631\u064e (he broke) takes the 7th conjugation, the root \u0631\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0628\u064e (he mounted) takes the form of the 8th conjugation. The Omanee dialect occasionally disregards this rule of common usage, and adopts the one or the other form according to local usage, thus although \u064a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0627\u0641\u064e, \u064a\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0628\u064f, \u064a\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0631\u064f are the forms in common use, one often meets with \u064a\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0628\u064f, \u064a\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0631\u064f, \u064a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0627\u0641\u064e, etc., both conveying the same sense, namely the passive condition resulting from the action of the primary verb. There is, however, a great tendency to the use of the 8th conjugation in preference, which is not only used in this sense, but is also sometimes made use of to express the sense of the simple primary verb. Another remarkable peculiarity, especially in the colloquial, is the elision of the initial \u0644 in the preterite of both these conjugations, the vowel kasrah belonging to it being transferred to the first following letter, and the suk\u00fcn of that letter removed to the next following one, thus \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0631\u064e, \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0652\u062a\u064e\u062e\u064e\u0628\u064e, etc., would be in the Omanee dialect \u0646\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0631\u064e, \u062a\u064e\u062e\u064e\u0628\u064e, etc. The 10th conjugation \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0633\u064e\u062a\u064e\u063a\u064e\u0644\u064e is not only used to express actions of asking, considering, desiring, and the like as in standard Arabic, but is also sometimes used to convey the sense of the primary verb or that of the 1st conjugation, thus \u0622\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0627\u062d\u0650\u0628\u064f \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e (I like this place), which expressions do not necessarily convey any sense of preference. The 5th conjugation is in common use, but the 9th is rarely used either colloquially or in writing, the action derived from the noun of colour or quality\nbeing generally expressed by the addition of \u0625\u0650\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0649 or \u064a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0649 (it became) to the noun; thus instead of expressing \u0625\u0650\u062d\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0631\u064e (it became red), the Om\u00e1n\u00e9es would express it as \u0625\u0650\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0649 \u0623\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0631\u064e.\n\nThe conditional subjunctive is generally expressed by the conditional particle \u0625\u0646 of which colloquially \u0625\u0646 is often altogether dropped and \u0643\u0627\u0646 never inflected; thus \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0634\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0622\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0622\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0622\u062c\u0650\u064a\u0643\u064e (if you wait for me I shall come to you), \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0637\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064a \u063a\u064e\u0648\u0627\u0632\u0650\u064a (I shall do it if you give me money), \u062a\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0628\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u062a\u064e\u062c\u0650\u064a\u064e \u062a\u064e\u063a\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e (come if you can). Conditional sentences conveying the sense of the past are generally introduced by the particle \u0644\u064e\u0651\u0648\u0652 followed by \u0643\u0627\u0646 in the complement, which, as is the case with \u0625\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0646, is never inflected, whilst the complementary particle \u0644\u064e\u0651\u0648\u0652 of the standard is never used; \u0643\u0627\u0646 also is sometimes used in this sense instead of \u0644\u064e\u0651\u0648\u0652, thus \u0644\u064e\u0651\u0648\u0652 \u0622\u063a\u0652\u0637\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0622\u063a\u0652\u0637\u0650\u064a\u062a\u064e\u0643\u064e (if he had given me I should or would have given you), \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u062e\u064e\u0631\u064e\u062c\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u062a\u064e\u062e\u0652\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0643\u064e \u0644\u064e\u0648\u0652 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u062e\u064e\u0631\u064e\u062c\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u062a\u064e\u062e\u0652\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0643\u064e (if you had not gone out they would have killed you).\n\nIn this dialect the double verbs undergo a remarkable change in the preterite of the 1st and 2nd persons; the third radical is kept united with the second, and a vowel sound is inserted before the pronominal suffix in the shape of the diphthong \u064a. The aorist is regular in its inflexion, and follows the general rules observed in the case of other verbs, but retains the 2nd and 3rd radicals united in all the numbers and genders.\n\n\u0631\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064e\u0651 = he returned\n\n(used in the transitive and intransitive senses).\n\n**Preterite.**\n\n| Plural. | Singular. |\n|--------|-----------|\n| Feminine. | Common. | Masculine. |\n| Feminine. | Common. | Masculine. |\n| \u0631\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064e\u0651\u0646\u064e | \u0631\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064e\u0651\u0648\u0652 | \u0631\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064e\u0651\u062a\u0652 | \u0631\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064e\u0651 | 3rd P. |\n| \u0631\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064e\u0651\u062a\u0652\u0646\u064e | \u0631\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064e\u0651\u062a\u0652\u0648\u0652 | \u0631\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064e\u0651\u062a\u0652\u062a\u0652 | \u0631\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064e\u0651\u062a\u0652 | 2nd P. |\n| \u0631\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064e\u0651\u062a\u0652\u0646\u064e | \u0631\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064e\u0651\u062a\u0652\u0648\u0652 | \u0631\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064e\u0651\u062a\u0652\u062a\u0652 | \u0631\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064e\u0651\u062a\u0652 | 1st P. |\n\nVOL.

In verbs with final \u0648 and \u064a the passive participle always takes an additional \u0644 after the second radical, whilst a quiescent \u064a becomes the final letter; thus \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0651 (built), \u0634\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0651\u064a\u064e\u0651 (watered), \u063a\u064e\u0637\u064e\u0651\u064a\u064e\u0651 (given), \u0645\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0645\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0651 (thrown), \u0639\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0632\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0651 (raided). The passive participle of \u0632\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e\u0648\u0652\u064a\u064f is \u0634\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0651 (shown).\n\nThe English perfect with the auxiliary verb to have, which would be expressed in standard Arabic by the addition of \u0641\u064e\u062f\u064e, denoting the nearness of the past to the present, is represented in this dialect by the nomina agentis of the measure \u0641\u064e\u0627\u0639\u0650\u0644, which, properly speaking, is only a verbal adjective, and as such is declinable; thus \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0644\u064e (he has arrived), \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0644\u064f (they have arrived), \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0644\u064e\u062a\u0652 (she has arrived), \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0644\u064e\u062a\u0652 (they fem. have arrived). Similarly \u062c\u064e\u0623\u064e\u064a\u0652 (he has come or is in the act of coming), \u0631\u064e\u0623\u064e\u064a\u0652 (he has sent), \u0631\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0628\u064e (he has mounted), \u0637\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e\u0639\u064e (he has gone out). This form does away with the necessity of expressing the pluperfect with \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e. The energetic \u0646\u064e is sometimes added on to the perfect without conveying any sense of emphasis, thus \u0648\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0623\u064e\u064a\u0652 (who has sent him or it?), \u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652 (he has brought it).

In writing, the final l of the third and second persons masculine plurals is also generally elided, which form is retained here to show the dialectical peculiarity.\n\nAnother peculiarity of this dialect is the universal adoption of the verb \u0633\u064e\u0648\u0650\u064a\u0652 (to do, to make, originally to make level or straight) and its 8th conjugation \u0625\u0650\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0648\u0650\u064a\u0652 (to become, originally to become level or straight) for expressing actions of all kinds, the meaning of the particular action being conveyed either by the context or the noun denoting the object which follows it, or by the existing circumstances. It primarily carries with it the sense of making or doing, and in government with substantives does away with the necessity of expressing an action by its proper verb. Thus there is no action which cannot be expressed by its application, provided the speaker and person spoken to have the same object in view. It and its derived form closely correspond to the English verb to do and to become, owing to the numberless shades of meaning they are employed to convey, thus \u0633\u064e\u0648\u0650\u064a\u0652 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0650\u0651\u0631\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0650 might mean one of several actions according to existing circumstances, that is to say, if the lamp is ready and it is time to light it, it would necessarily mean light the lamp; but if it is not time to light it, and if it is not ready, it would simply mean prepare the lamp; thus also if a dish of food be placed before a person the order \u0633\u064e\u0648\u0650\u064a\u0652 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0634\u0650 would necessarily mean eat, whilst \u0633\u064e\u0648\u0650\u064a\u0652 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0634\u0650 would mean cook the rice. The 8th conjugation \u0625\u0650\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0648\u0650\u064a\u0652, beside being the reflective voice of the primary verb in all its shades of meaning, sometimes conveys a sense of possibility in the third person singular of the aorist; thus \u064a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0648\u0650\u064a\u0652 used alone may mean it is possible, and corresponds in sense to \u064a\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0643\u064f\u0646\u0652 and \u064a\u064e\u062d\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0645\u0650\u0644\u0652.

As has been already noticed before, the preposition \u0628, when attached to a pronominal affix, a substantive or a separate pronoun in the sense of with or together with, invariably becomes \u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627, which, owing to an interchange of sounds between \u0628 and \u0648, is very often heard pronounced as \u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u064a; thus \u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u064a, \u0648\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u064a, \u0648\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u064a\u064f\u0648, \u0648\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u064a\u064f\u0648 \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f, \u0648\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0643, \u0648\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0643\u064e, etc. The particle \u0644, when used as a sign of the dative, also takes sometimes the prolonged form \u0644\u0650\u064a, thus \u0644\u0650\u064a \u0632\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0631. The use of this particle is generally restricted to express the dative, whilst the sense of for, on account of, is conveyed by the words \u062d\u0627\u0644 and \u0644\u064e\u0623\u064e\u062c\u0652\u0644, thus \u062d\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u064e\u062c\u0652\u0644\u0648\u0628 (this book is brought for him); while\nexpresses an indefinite sense of possession like \u0645\u0627\u0644, and is often used to express the genitive, \u0644\u064e\u0623\u064e\u062c\u0652\u0644 expresses a purpose, thus \u0644\u064e\u0623\u064e\u062c\u0652\u0644\u064e \u0643\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627 \u0622\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u062c\u0650\u0626\u0652\u062a\u064f (for this purpose I came). \u0648\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0623\u064e\u062c\u0652\u0644\u064e and \u0628\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0623\u064e\u062c\u0652\u0644\u064e are also forms in use to express a reason, and are occasionally corrupted into \u0648\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0623\u064e\u062c\u0652\u0644\u064e and \u0628\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0623\u064e\u062c\u0652\u0644\u064e.\n\nThe preposition \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0649 sometimes takes the prolonged form \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u064a\u064e in writing, whilst \u062d\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0651\u0649 is invariably shortened into \u062d\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0651\u0649, no difference, however, being made in the pronunciation. \u062a\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0646 generally takes the place of \u0648\u064e\u0646\u064e to express than as a sign of the comparative degree, and \u0644\u064e\u062f\u064e\u064a\u0652 or \u0644\u064e\u062f\u064e\u064a\u0652 are only rarely used. Before (a place) is generally expressed by \u062a\u064e\u0642\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0651\u0645\u064e or \u0639\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0627\u0644, behind by \u0648\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064e, after by \u0628\u064e\u0639\u0652\u062f\u064e or \u0639\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0628\u064e\u0647\u064f, thus \u0639\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0628\u064e\u0647\u064f (after him), round about by \u062f\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0629\u064e, and sometimes by \u062d\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652, thus \u062d\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652 \u062f\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0629\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e (round about the place), \u062d\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652 (round about it); whilst \u0645\u064e\u0639\u064e, in addition to the generally known sense of with, is used sometimes to express to, thus \u0623\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064e\u062a\u064e \u0645\u064e\u0639\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0648\u0645\u064e (I went to him to-day). Like is expressed by \u0634\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0651\u0649 and not unfrequently by \u0648\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0644\u064e and \u0643\u064e\u0645\u0627.\n\nThe adverbial interrogatory particle \u0623\u064f is never used, a question being generally understood to be so by context, or intonation of the speaker. \u0633\u064e\u0646\u064e, the abbreviation of \u0633\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0646\u064e, is never used as a sign of futurity, but is substituted by \u0628\u064e, \u062d\u064e, \u0628\u064e, or \u0621, as has been mentioned before. The letter \u0645\u064e is generally used as the particle of imitative sequent, thus \u062e\u064e\u0631\u064e\u064a\u0637\u064e \u0645\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0637\u064e, \u062d\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0645\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e, \u0634\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0631\u064e \u0645\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0631\u064e.\n\nWhere is expressed by \u0643\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e or \u0648\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e, and whence, whither, and wherever by its combination with \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0649, \u0648\u064e\u0646\u064e and \u0645\u064e\u0627, thus \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0648\u064e\u0646\u064e \u0643\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e or \u0648\u064e\u0646\u064e \u0643\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e (whence), \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0648\u064e\u0646\u064e \u0648\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e (whither) and \u0648\u064e\u0646\u064e \u0648\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e \u0643\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e (wherever); wherever is also sometimes expressed by the simple adverbs \u0643\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e and \u062d\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062b\u064e, whilst whither by \u0643\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e or \u0648\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e simply.

Yet or still is expressed by \u0628\u064e\u0639\u0652\u062f\u064e, which in this sense, as has been observed before, takes the pronominal affixes after it to indicate the pronominal agent, and is also sometimes declined for number, but this occurs only in sea-coast towns, and is, properly speaking, not a feature of the dialect.\n\nWhy is generally expressed by \u062d\u064e\u0645\u064f\u0648\u0647\u064f, in which \u0645\u064e\u0648\u064e stands for \u0645\u064e\u0627, and which is therefore an abbreviation of \u062e\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0627 (for what); the word \u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0634\u064e is, however, the one generally used in writing, whilst \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0645\u064e\u0627 for \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0645\u064e\u0627 sometimes takes the place of \u062d\u064e\u0645\u064f\u0648\u0647\u064f colloquially, and, like \u0628\u064e\u0639\u0652\u062f\u064e, takes the pronominal affixes after it, in which case the long vowel, is altogether dropped, thus \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0645\u064e\u0627, \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0645\u064e\u0627, etc.\n\nThe tanween of the accusative adverbial case is generally\nomitted, excepting in the case of \u0623\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062f\u064b\u0627 (for ever or with a negative particle never), thus \u0628\u0650\u063a\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0629\u064d (suddenly) is used for \u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u062c\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064b (they have come together) as in \u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064b (together) stands for \u0648\u064e\u0627\u062d\u0650\u062f\u064b\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u062d\u0650\u062f\u064b\u0627 (gently or slowly) stands for \u0648\u064e\u0627\u062d\u0650\u062f\u064b\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u062d\u0650\u062f\u064b\u0627.

Yes in writing is generally expressed by \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064e whilst colloquially by \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064e or \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064e; the negative particles are \u0644\u064e\u0627 and \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064e, and sometimes \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064e, which, as in the standard, is used with the aorist to convey occasionally the sense of the past tense.\n\nNote.\n\nIt is to be distinctly understood that the dialect of which this paper treats is that of the Ahal-ul Hadar of O\u2019man, and not that of the Beduins. In the case of O\u2019m\u00e1nee words and expressions, to enable the reader to recognize the dialectical peculiarities, the phonetic in preference to the grammatical orthography, has been adopted throughout the paper.\n\n(To be continued.)\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\n1. The Kalasa, or Water-Pot, in connection with Burial Rites.\n\nSir,\u2014O'Donovan, about the time of his risky visit to Mervc, describes, in one of his letters, the Turkoman tombs about Tchikislar, on the south-east of the Caspian: \"The soldier's tomb consists of a pole of some twenty feet in length planted vertically in the sand, its base surrounded by a circle of small stones, within which are accumulated a selection of water-jars and earthen tea-pots, tributes to the memory of the deceased.\" This short quotation bears on what has formerly appeared in the Journal in relation to the vase or water-pot, and burial rites. Central Asia is near enough to India for a possible connection of customs between the two regions. It may also be of interest to know that this primitive use of the water-pot, as a sepulchral symbol, is not confined to the old world. In a work called The Myths of the New World, by Dan. G. Brinton, there is an account of a vision related by Coacooche, a Seminole chief-tain, in which he says he visited \"the happy hunting grounds and saw my sister, long since gone. She offered me a cup of pure water, which she said came from the spring of the Great Spirit, and if I should drink of it, I should return and live with men for ever. Some such mystical respect for the element, rather than as a mere outfit for his spirit home, probably induced the earlier tribes of the same territory to place the conch-shell, which the deceased had used for a cup, conspicuously on his grave, and the Mexicans and Peruvians to inter a vase filled with water with the corpse, or to sprinkle it with liquid, baptizing it, as\nit were, into its new associations. It was an emblem of hope that should cheer the dwellings of the dead, a symbol of the resurrection which is in store for those who go down to the grave. The vase or the gourd as a symbol of water, the source and preserver of life, is a conspicuous figure in the myths of Ancient America. As Akbal or Huecomitl, the great or original vase, in Aztec and Maya legends, it plays important parts in the drama of creation,\u201d pp. 135\u20136.\n\nI offer these references, which may be worth adding to the collection of data on this subject.\n\nWilliam Simpson.\n\nThe Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n2. The Kalasa, or Water-Pot, in Indian Architecture.\n\nCollector\u2019s Camp, Panwell,\nKolaba Districts,\nApril 21st, 1889.\n\n. . . . . I have been looking over the plates in Fergusson\u2019s Indian Architecture, to see what could be made out of them about the \u0100malaka ornament on temple spires.\n\nThere is a pretty good sequence in respect of pillars.\n\nIn the early caves an inverted bell-shaped water-pot is a common capital (Fergusson\u2019s \u201cPersepolitan\u201d capital), and one of very similar shape is still used in the cave region to cap the \u201cKambs\u201d (Stambha) erected near many villages for festival purposes\u2014\u201cMaypoles\u201d one might call them.\n\nWhere anything has to be superimposed on a round bottomed inverted pot, the annular pad is as necessary between them as it is under the pot when right side up.\n\nAccordingly at Beds\u00e9, Karl\u00e9, etc., you find this capital connected with the abacus by such a pad, and the whole construction strengthened and secured by a square frame of very modern design.\n\nThis capital dies out as we get to the later caves, and is replaced by a pot right side up. Under this there is always a circular member, which appears to me to be the same pad\nin its right place. The artists, however, have usually turned it into a garland of Champaka flowers, slightly conventionalized.\n\nSo in modern Hindu festivals I have seen the pad supporting a water-chatty (itself often made of rags, and far from ornamental), surrounded and concealed by a garland of real flowers, which appears to support the pot.\n\nAs we get on in the caves, and into the early structural temples, the pad has in some cases a tendency to disappear; and at last we have, on one side, vases capable of supporting themselves; as in the Lankeswara at Ellora, and illustration 180 of *I. and E. Architecture*. On the other side, however, the pad supersedes the pot, and becomes the \"cushion\" capital of Elephanta and its generation of caves.\n\nI think we have here a clear case of the influence of this annular pad upon pillar designs, including pots. And as in the temple spires we have undoubtedly the pot (which goes to this day by that very name \"kalas\"), the argument from analogy is very strong that the thing next under the pot was originally in the spires (as it clearly was in the pillars) the same thing that is next to the pot on every Hindu woman's head and in every Hindu hut of the India of to-day.\n\nAnother thing about the spires is at page 116 of the *Cave Temples* (note), where Mr. Fergusson makes some suggestions about Draupadi's Rath at Mahavallipur as possibly representing the germ of the North-Indian spire.\n\nNow, the roof of Draupadi's Rath shows a curve (or set of curves) which can only be taken from bamboo construction; as the Hindus of the eighth century certainly had no curved iron roofs, bamboos were the only other possible material.\n\nLooking at the woodcut we see a bamboo form ready to develope either into the exaggerated curves of the modern Bengali temple roof, or into the aspiring sweep of the northern Vim\u0101na. I may add that in my opinion it is no mere accident or caprice that has given the monolithic temples of Mahavallipur the name of \"Raths,\" or chariots.\nThe people who first gave that name to these small standing fixed temples were probably, as their descendants are to-day, accustomed to seeing the gods' \"Raths\" or \"Catafalques\" constructed in the shape of small temples.\n\nI think that in a former letter I quoted the little fixed stone Rath with moveable stone wheels at Vijayanagar (I. and E. Architecture, p. 375).\n\nAnd where you have any covered carriage in natural India you are not very far from the bamboo.\n\nW. F.

General Meetings of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n15th April, 1889.\u2014Sir Thomas Wade, K.C.B., K.C.M.G., in the Chair.\n\nThe election by the Council of the following new members was announced to the Society: Brynmir Jones, Esq., County Court Judge of Gloucester; The Divan Daulat Ram; II. Thomson Lyon, Esq.; Mr. Justice Pinhey (Retired Bombay Service); The Baron George de Reuter.\n\nMr. Granville Browne, Reader in Persian at the University of Cambridge, read the first part of his paper on the B\u0101b\u012bs, that part which appears in this issue of the Society's Journal.\n\nIn the discussion which followed Sir Murdock Smith, Mr. Kay, Ghool Meer Khan, Baron George de Reuter, General Schindler, Mr. Pusey, and Mr. Hyde Clarke, took part.\n\n20th May, 1889.\u2014Sir Thomas Wade, K.C.B., K.C.M.G., in the Chair.\n\nThe election by the Council of the following new members was announced to the Society: Alexander Francis Baillie, Esq.; P. V. Chari, Esq., of Lincoln's Inn.\n\nThe President said: Before calling upon our Secretary to read the report of the Council on the working of the Society during the past year, I have only a very few words to say. The Society has this year to deplore the loss by death of\nmore than the usual number of its members. Captain Eastwick and Colonel Nassau Lees had rendered important service, in their special departments, to the work of the Society, and the Pandit Bhagvanl\u0101l Indraj\u012b, one of the most distinguished of our Honorary Members, was a remarkable instance of the success with which the most intelligent natives of India have been able to add to their native scholarship the knowledge also of the European canons of historical criticism. A full account of the labours of these scholars will be found in the Obituary Notices published in our Journal. On the financial position of our Society the Report will speak for itself. I have to congratulate the Society on the results there shown, and would only add that the improvement is largely due to the zeal and ability of our Secretary. We can also say that the number of papers sent in for publication in the Journal\u2014always a safe test of the vitality of the Society\u2014is increasing in a very satisfactory degree.\n\nThe Secretary then read the\n\n**Report.**\n\nThe Council of the Royal Asiatic Society have to report that since the last Report the Society has lost by death or retirement nine Resident and seven non-Resident Members, and has admitted as new Members ten Resident and eleven non-Resident Members, showing a gain of three Members for the year.\n\nThe Society has to regret the loss by death during the last year of the following Members: General Baillie, Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, James M. Campbell, Captain Eastwick, Tyrrell Leith, Colonel Nassau Lees, Dr. Loewe, General Malcolm, W. G. Palgrave.\n\nThe following is the list of the new Members referred to above: Resident\u2014Petrus Aganoor, Esq., Alexander Francis Baillie, P. Narismha Chari, Dewan Dowlat Ram, Brynm\u00eer Jones, H. Thomson Lyon, Baron George de Reuter, Mr. Justice Pinhey. Non-Resident\u2014Edward Granville Browne\n(Persian Lecturer at Cambridge), L. C. Casartelli, Lionel Charles Hopkins, Enri\u00f3 Inouy\u00e9 (of Japan), D. Lulloobhoy, the Zemindar of Sangamvalsu.\n\nBesides the above, the following institutions and libraries have become subscribers to the Journal, under the new rule No. 59, passed by the Society at its last Anniversary Meeting: The Bibliotheca Nazionale Central, Firenze, the East Indian United Service Club, the Indian Institute, Oxford, the London Institution, the London Library, Messrs. Parker, Messrs. B. F. Stevens, Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner (35 copies), the National Liberal Club, the United Service Club.\n\nThe statement of membership at the present date is therefore as follows:\n\nMembers who have compounded\u2014\n\n| Residents | Non-Residents |\n|-----------|--------------|\n| 42        | 53 \u2014 95      |\n\nMembers who have not compounded\u2014\n\n| Residents | Non-Residents | Subscribers to the Journal | Honorary Members |\n|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------|------------------|\n| 126       | 172 \u2014 298    | 44                          | 30               |\n\nTotal ................. 467\n\nThis list represents an income of \u00a3655 19s. The actual receipts from subscriptions for the year ending Dec. 1888, was \u00a3575 12s. 7d., which is a larger income than has ever been received from subscriptions in any one year since the Society was founded.

The Council may add in this connection that there have been discovered since the last Report statements of income and expenditure for some years before the earliest accounts then known to exist. An abstract of the balance sheets from the year 1831 down to the year 1888 is accordingly appended to this Report. It has been a matter of no little difficulty to prepare this table. But it is encouraging to see that the financial position of the Society has been gradually but steadily improving for some time past, and is in fact more assured now than it has ever been.\n\nAs special receipts, not properly to be described as income, swell the total receipts of certain years (notably 1835-37, and 1851-52), a separate column has been added showing the nature of them, and headed accordingly \"Special Receipts.\"\n\nThe Council recommend the following officers for election for the ensuing year:\n\nPresident.\u2014Sir Thomas F.

On the recommendation of the Council, Muhammad Hasan Khan, Etinad us-Sultaneh, Minister of the Press to the Shah of Persia, was elected an Extraordinary Member.\n\nIt was resolved to record on the minutes the deep regret of the Society at the death of its distinguished Honorary Member Professor William Wright, of Cambridge, and the President was requested to convey to his widow this expression of regret.\n\nMr. Granville Browne read the second part of his paper on the B\u00e1b\u00eds, dealing more especially with their literature and opinions. The paper will appear in full in the October number of the Journal.\n\nDr. Leitner, being invited by Sir F. Goldsmid to make some remarks on the paper read, drew special attention to the movement which now characterized the Muhammadan world. This was not so much the growth of rationalism among a certain section of Muhammadans in different countries who had come in contact with Europeans, or the adoption of European reforms in an Oriental garb, as was to some extent the case with the B\u00e1b\u00eds, but the rise or development to almost unexampled influence of mystic sects, whose heads, each in their own way, claimed before their followers to be the door, avenue, or \"b\u00e1b,\" to the Deity. The orthodox clergy were puzzled how to act in this matter, for, on the one hand, they did not wish to quench the spirit of Muhammadan fervour evoked by these sects, and, on the other, the interposition of saint- or chief-worship, was opposed to the true spirit of single-minded orthodox Muhammadanism. The fact was, that old bodies like the Naqshbandis, K\u00e1diris, etc., had received a new lease of\nlife from the impetus given by European encroachments, whilst new sects like the Sen\u00fbsis had acquired an enormous influence which might soon be a danger to the orthodox community. Sunnis were less affected by such aberrations than the Shias, whose quicker imagination, influenced by the spirit of Persian scepticism, ever made them a ready prey to false Im\u00e1ms; but even the Sunnis could not escape the contagion, for not only was there ever a covert affection for the \"House of 'Ali,\" which was fostered by its descendants, the Shar\u00edfs and Sayads, but a \"Mahdi\" was also looked forward to by them as a Messiah for existing evils. Yet the pseudo-Mahdi of the Soudan was not the coming Im\u00e1m of the Shias, for was he not succeeded by a Khal\u00edfa, and were his pretensions, as expressed in his letters to Gordon, to the Viceroy of Egypt, and to Her Majesty, and in his proclamations, not actually self-condemned, or at all events explained in them? These matters deserved greater consideration than they had received in official reports, and Dr. Leitner felt certain that had the question of the exact position of the Mahdi been properly studied, as late even as 1883, the mischief in the Soudan might have been avoided. As for the B\u00e1b\u00eds, they seemed inoffensive enough, to judge from what Professor Browne had said; they reminded him of the crude notions of reforms which germinated in the heads of young Hindus or Muhammadans who had just passed the Entrance Examination of an Anglo-Indian University and who wanted to combine reform with self-deification. If, however, B\u00e1b\u00edism was something more than this, then it might have esoteric analogies to those pernicious sects which were more or less connected with the history or legendary tradition that had sprung up in connexion with the Seventh Im\u00e1m, in other words, with the Ismailians, the so-called Assassins or Hash\u00edsh\u00edn, the followers of the old man of the mountain and the worshippers of the mad Fatimit\u00e9 Khal\u00edfa of Egypt, H\u00e1kim. The direct lineal descendant of the Seventh Im\u00e1m was, for the existing Ismailians, H. H. Aga Khan of Bombay, a very amiable nobleman, fond of\nracing, and as pious as many of his followers were impious; but he was the object of veneration or rather adoration of thousands in Central Asia, especially in Derw\u00e1z, Shign\u00e1n Wakhan, Zeb\u00e1k, Hunza, etc., and to him, instead of to Mecca or Kerbela, was a pilgrimage properly due, for a living Im\u00e1m was surely better than a dead prophet. Dr. Leitner possessed some portions of the mysterious Kel\u00e1m-i-p\u00edr, which, with these nominal Muhammadans, took the place of the Kor\u00e1n (thus offering an analogy with what he had understood Professor Browne remark as regards the B\u00e1bis). The \"Kel\u00e1m-i-p\u00edr\" was a work which practically dismissed most of the orthodox Sunni or Shi\u00e1h observances; indeed to the Mul\u00e1\u00eds or modern Ismailians the Sunni was a dog and the Shi\u00e1h an ass, and the specific tenet was the inter-relation of all life, whether animal, human or that in plants and even stone, instead of personal immortality rewarded immediately by eternal bliss or eternal damnation. The practice in Hunza was gross immorality; the Tham or ruler used to dance and get drunk in the local Mosque; but details on the Kel\u00e1m-i-p\u00edr, the Mul\u00e1i sect or the Ismailians of the Hindukush, and the coincidences of their forms with those of the Druses, especially with the covenant \"Mith\u00e1q,\" of the latter he reserved to a special communication. Dr. Leitner had just sent (on the 14th inst.) a Hunza man to a pilgrimage to Kerbel\u00e1 by the \"Kaisar-i-Hind,\" disembarking at Port Said. He had been converted to Shiism, and was the first Hunza man who had come to Europe. The struggle between the hereditary principle of the spiritual succession from Muhammad or \"Im\u00e1mat,\" supported by the Shi\u00e1hs, and the elective theory of the Khil\u00e1fat, as now embodied in the Sult\u00e1n of Turkey by the \"consensus fidelium,\" were the corner-stones respectively of these two contending sects, among whom there might well be peace, so that Muhammadanism might be appreciated in its fulness and as a sister-faith of Christianity and Judaism; but, be this as it may, and be the differences between Sunnis and Shi\u00e1hs, as also the aberrations from the latter, chiefly religious, ethnical or even political, there\ncould be no doubt that the hereditary view of Shiism had been influenced by the claims of 'Ali and of his successors to certain landed property, which Muhammad, and after him Abu Bekr, Omar and Othman, held on behalf of the community, \"the jem\u00e1'a't,\" the word accompanying the \"Sunnat wa Jam\u00e1'at,\" the appellation for the Sunni world. Mr. Browne had also referred to the Wah\u00e1b\u00eds. There was a great difference between the Wah\u00e1b\u00eds of Arabia and those of India, erroneously so-called, because most of them did not even know the name of the founder of the Arabian sect, Abd-ul-Wah\u00e1b; some of the Indians even smoked, but, of course, as Puritans, they ought not to indulge in any such gratification, in silk dress, dainty food, etc., and they ought to avoid the worship of saints. As for the charge of disloyalty that had been brought against the Indian Wah\u00e1b\u00eds, they were neither more nor less disloyal than their accusers; but, being in the minority, they had to bear the accusations of the majority. The Indian Wah\u00e1b\u00eds were \"Muv\u00e1hid\u00edn\" or \"worshippers of the one and true God,\" and any one who cared to read up this important subject could not do better than study the learned works of Maulvi Sidiq Husain. Dr. Leitner then asked a number of questions from Mr. Browne regarding his interesting paper, and regretted that the author of it should have skipped so much of it that would have deepened the impression of the meeting as to its great value. However, he, with all those present, looked forward to its appearance in full in print, when it would stimulate further inquiries in that and kindred directions.\n\nMr. H. C. Kay said, I have long been under the belief that a direct connection may be distinctly traced between modern Babism and the old religious movements which, during the Muhammadan period, have originated in Persia or have been led by Persians in other countries. After having now had the pleasure of listening to both parts of Mr. Granville Browne's instructive paper, I feel strongly confirmed in that view.\n\nOne of the strangest things in history is, as is well known, the extraordinary vitality exhibited by the ancient philosophy\nof the Persians, its continuity down to comparatively recent periods, and, as I believe Babism will help to prove, down to the present day. Ismailism and its predecessor the insurrection led by Babek, carry us back to the teaching of Mani in the third century of our era, and the elements of Manich\u00e6ism must be sought for in the remotest periods of Persian history. The mystical teaching of Sufyism, propagated by Persian writers, who whilst professing boundless devotion to Islam, have inculcated doctrines absolutely opposed to its fundamental principles, may be said to have kept alive much of the ancient philosophy. But Sufyism has been rather a symptom, demonstrating the prevailing spirit of the Persian temperament, than a cause to which its existence could be attributed.\n\nUnfortunately we know but little of the teaching of Babek, and our knowledge even of Ismailism is very imperfect. In both cases the difficulty is largely the result of a circumstance which, unless I am greatly mistaken, forms a serious obstacle to a full comprehension of Babism. Secrecy has formed one of the main elements of the policy whereby, under pretence of inculcating a stricter observance of the religious law introduced by the conquerors, it has been sought to transform their religion into something absolutely inconsistent with its real spirit. In the case of Ismailism, the mass of the people, it is well known, was kept in ignorance of the goal which it was helping its leaders to reach. A comparatively small number, whose vanity was carefully flattered, were, under the seal of secrecy, allowed an insight into mystical interpretations, all tending in a direction at best only dimly perceptible to the learner. Only a select few were allowed admission into the innermost circle of men who, with full and complete knowledge, laboured for the definite ends, to the attainment of which they had devoted their lives. How admirably their policy was based upon a deep knowledge of human nature and a profound insight into the character of the people with whom they had to deal, has been clearly shown by such scholars as de Sacy and his distinguished successor Professor de Goeje. And a\nnoteworthy piece of evidence to the wonderful skill with which the Ismailites advanced their objects may be perceived in the history of the Carmathians of Bahrain, where a people, mainly composed of Arab Muslims, was induced to intercept the caravans proceeding to and from the Holy Cities and to put an end, by terror of plunder and massacre, to the practice of pilgrimage from the most important and one of the largest portions of the Muhammadan empire. Marching next upon Mecca itself, they devastated the city, massacred both pilgrims and citizens, defiled in the grossest manner its most sacred spots, and finally tore down and carried away the Black Stone, than which no religion probably possesses an object of more general and of deeper reverence.\n\nThe mutual hostility between Persians on the one side and Arabs and Turks on the other is commonly ascribed to their religious differences. In the adoption of that view, I venture to think that cause is mistaken for effect. The Persians were subdued by a barbarous race, infinitely their inferior in intellectual capacity. And the consequences have been precisely such as were to be expected. As to the barbarism of the conqueror, it is unnecessary to speak. As to the intellectual superiority of the Persians, it is enough to say that it is distinctly admitted by the Arabs themselves. And indeed the fact is one which it is not possible to dispute. In every department of Arabic literature, not excluding Arab linguistic science, the leading names are those of men of northern race and for the most part of Persians. The Persians adopted Shi-ism and originated its extreme developments, not only because these afforded them scope for indulgence in their traditionary love for pantheistic mysticism, but also because they offered them the means of freeing themselves from political and intellectual enthralment. I had the pleasure last year of making the acquaintance of Dr. Snouek Hurgronje, whose name is already familiar to all interested in Eastern scholarship. Our conversation was not on the particular subject before the present meeting, but rather on his experiences of men and things, acquired\nduring his sojourn at Mecca. His opinion that the hostility I have spoken of is far rather of a political than of a religious character was clear, and he pointed to the significant fact that the South-Arabian Zeydite, who in the eyes of a Sunnite is no less a r\u0101fi\u1e0d\u012b or heretic than the Persian Shi-ites, is everywhere admitted and received as a friend and fellow-religionist.\n\nNotwithstanding the mists produced by their system of secrecy and by the reports of enemies, partly calumnious, but in part also resting upon an indubitable foundation of fact, the object which the leaders of Ismailism kept steadily in view is not capable of doubt. They sought to acquire for themselves that supremacy over the Muhammadan faith, which formed the corner-stone of the power that had been wielded by the Arab, and which was afterwards won by the Turkish race, a position in which they could mould the Semitic system at their will. How nearly they approached complete success and what the causes were that led to their eventual failure, forms the subject, as I need hardly remind this meeting, of one of the most extraordinary chapters in the history of the human race. As to the causes of failure, I may perhaps allow myself to add that they were, to my mind, chiefly the result of one weak point in the fabric erected with such wonderful ability and patience. The danger was either unperceived or, as seems to me more probable, it is one which it was not found possible to remedy. The Ismaily system required its supreme guidance to be confided to an all-powerful political as well as religious chief. That object was attained when the rival Khalifate was established at Kayrav\u0101n, and more completely so when its seat was transferred to the wealthy and more central province of Egypt. But the Khalifah and the subordinate princes as well, were inevitably placed under strong temptation to care rather for the security of their thrones and dynasties, than for the triumph of the system they were intended to foster. Herein, let me add as an example, we may probably find an explanation of that signal act of ingratitude committed by the Mahdi \u2018Obayd Allah when he\nmercilessly put to death the man, a zealous Ismailite agent, to whom he was absolutely indebted for his liberty, for his throne, and for his life, and doubtless also a leading motive for the abandonment of the Fatemite cause by the Carmathians and by the Eastern Ismailites.\n\nIt can hardly be necessary for me to say that I do not conceive Babism to be an actual revival of Ismailite designs or even of so much of the Ismailite system as could serve to identify the two movements as one and the same. Times change, and under altered circumstances even similar causes will not produce the same phenomena. But it is sufficiently clear that the old religious movements and Babism have much in common, and that they derive their elements from the same source. As to political tendencies in Babism, the letter of which Mr. Browne has just spoken, in which the Queen is praised for subordinating the rule of her Empire to the advice of a council elected by the nation, can hardly be without significance. But indeed, as all here present are well aware, religious and civil law and government are, in the East, inseparably connected with one another. However much, or however little special information the Persian Government may have possessed, it was inevitable that the author of the B\u0101bi movement should be suspected of political and perhaps revolutionary designs. Whether the ruling power may not some day be induced to consider the possibility of converting Babists from victims into instruments is a question I can only venture to suggest to those more competent than I am to offer an answer.\n\nMr. Browne has also told us that the Bay\u0101n is leavened with Zoroastrian ideas. The fact may seem strange, but it is precisely what we would expect. There is nothing new, I may add, in the designation Bab; it was used by the Ismailites, who, as mentioned by Prof. de Goeje, applied it in particular to Aly, son of Abu T\u0101lib.\n\nThe practical conclusion I have desired to indicate is this, that the history of the past will in Persia, above all other countries, help us to understand the present, and that careful study of past movements, and especially of Ismailism, will, I\nbelieve, suggest to the inquirer into Babism the quarters in which some of its most important factors are to be sought. And furthermore that it will supply him with a key by means of which he will more readily arrive at an understanding of things that are obscure, and even of language which to the uninitiated may be misleading.\n\nList of Presents to the Society, April\u2013July, 1889.\n\nFrom H.M. the Shah of Persia.\u2014Journey through Khorassan.

Obituary Notice.\n\nDr. William Wright, Sir T. Adams\u2019s Professor of Arabic at Cambridge, whose death on the 22nd of May last is the heaviest blow which Oriental studies have sustained since the decease of the veteran Fleischer, was born in India in 1830. His father was a Scottish officer in the East India Company\u2019s service, and his mother, whose maiden name was Overbeck, was the daughter of the last Dutch governor of Chinsurah. From her Wright seems to have inherited some of his linguistic talents, for she was no mean proficient in Persian, and watched with loving interest the development of scholarly tastes in her son. Captain Wright, having returned to Scotland, settled at St. Andrews; his son received his education there, first at the Madras College, and then at the ancient University, for which he retained to the\nlast a warm love. He distinguished himself in classics, and after taking his degree at the early age which was then common in the Scottish Universities, proceeded to Germany to continue his philological studies at the University of Halle. Here the influence of the famous Orientalist R\u00f6diger, in whose house he was received as an inmate, soon led him to turn from classical to Oriental letters, into the study of which he threw himself with great ardour. His chief love was for the Semitic languages, and especially for Arabic, but he also attained no mean proficiency in Sanskrit, Persian, Turkish, and other Eastern tongues. In later years, when he felt that life was short, and began to doubt whether he could finish all the tasks he had prescribed for himself in his favourite branch, Wright resolutely turned aside from these secondary pursuits, and few, even of his friends, had opportunity to know how wide and solid were his attainments beyond the limits of Semitic speech. But to the last he followed with interest other men's work in every field of Oriental research, and it is mainly to his initiative and advice that Cambridge owes its magnificent collection of Buddhist-Sanskrit MSS., of which a great part were brought from Nepal by his brother Dr. D. Wright.\n\nR\u00f6diger was always wont to speak of Wright as his best scholar, and certainly the rapidity with which the young Scotsman conquered the difficulties of a whole series of languages was marvellous. From Halle he passed on to Leyden, then as now one of the most famous seats of Arabic learning, and here at the age of twenty-two he brought out his first work, an edition of the travels of Ibn Jubair. Already he showed the judgment which habitually guided him in the choice of work, the courage which never failed him in the face of difficulties, the fulness of resource, and solid precision in execution, which characterize all his editions. To edit a difficult text from a single MS. is a formidable undertaking even for an experienced scholar, but this Erstlingsarbeit shows no sign of immaturity, and few lines in it would call for correction at the present day. As an editor Wright was cautious and conservative; he was\nalways slow to introduce conjectures, while his unfailing eye and hand rendered it almost impossible for him to err in transcribing the MS. before him: the best scholars of the continent have confessed that there was no appeal from Wright's transcripts to the original. Like all men who have the inborn gift that makes a pal\u00e6ographer, he took pleasure in the work of transcription, and would copy off pages of dim and puzzling Arabic in the clear hand which he had formed on one of the finest old Codices of the Warnerianum, as fast as a clerk would transcribe an ordinary letter. Wright's caution in the matter of textual emendation was characteristic of the solid habit of mind which never allowed him to mistake a conjecture for a fact; he spared no pains to bring together all that could throw light on the facts, but he was willing to leave the inferences to others. Perhaps, indeed, he carried this habit to excess; for those who knew him well were aware that he had excellent and original ideas on many vexed subjects of Eastern lore which he never cared to publish, because they could not be established by strict proof.\n\nA great part of his life-work was given to the editing of texts, mainly Syriac and Arabic; and of this labour he was never weary. They were always important texts, put forth with the most perfect diplomatic accuracy, and with full command of all needful helps and side lights. But the texts he published himself give but an imperfect view of his services in bringing to light the buried stores of Oriental literature. His wide knowledge of MSS., exact verbal scholarship, and expert pen, were at the service of every scholar, and there are few editors of Arabic and Syriac works in the last thirty years who have not had to acknowledge his aid either in supplying transcripts and collations, or in reading and correcting proof-sheets. In this connection special mention should be made of his prolonged and arduous labours on the Thesaurus Syriacus of the Dean of Canterbury.\n\nA second kind of work in which Wright was a past master was the pal\u00e6ographical description and cataloguing of MSS.\nFrom 1861 to 1870 he was employed in the Oriental Branch of the MS. Department of the British Museum, first as an assistant and then as assistant keeper. His catalogues of the Syriac and \u00c6thiopic MSS.\u2014both models of what a catalogue should be\u2014are permanent memorials of his labours in this department; and to these will soon be added the work of his last months, the Catalogue of the \"additional\" Syriac MSS. at Cambridge, including the fine collection brought from Mesopotamia by Dr. Badger. On all questions of Syriac and Arabic pal\u00e6ography, Wright's judgment, matured as it was by constant familiarity with MSS., was probably worth more than that of any other scholar in Europe. In this connection should be named also the Oriental Series of the publications of the Pal\u00e6ographical Society, which was directed and edited by him. It may be interesting to mention that when the Shapira fragments were brought to London, Wright was in Scotland; but without further aid than the first imperfect notices that appeared in print, he told the writer of these lines that he had no doubt that they were forgeries written on scraps of leather cut from the margins of Yemenite MSS., as was afterwards proved to be the case. In epigraphy, as well as in pal\u00e6ography, Wright took a great interest, and many communications on this subject were read by him before the Society of Biblical Archaeology.\n\nHis work as a teacher has still to be spoken of. From 1855 to 1861 he was Professor of Arabic, first in University College, London, and then at Dublin, and from 1870 till his death he was the head of the Semitic school at Cambridge, which owes him a great debt of gratitude, not only for his admirable and stimulating teaching in Arabic and Syriac, but perhaps most of all for the improvement in Hebrew study which has followed, indirectly, from the introduction, through his example and influence, of the comparative method. His lectures on the Comparative Grammar of the Semitic Languages were a new thing in England; probably, indeed, nothing so complete and systematic has yet been attempted in any European University. These lectures have been left in such a form that they can be printed, and their\npublication has been undertaken by the Syndics of the University Press.\n\nOf the books which Prof. Wright published to help learners in Arabic, the Reading Book, 1870, remains unfortunately incomplete, the glossary which he projected and in great part prepared having never found a publisher. This is the more to be regretted, because he designed it on such a scale as would have made it a substantial contribution to a scientific Arabic Lexicon. As it is, his lexicographical collections remain unpublished, with the exception of the notes he contributed to Dozy's *Supplement aux dictionnaire arabes*. His Arabic Grammar had a better fate, having passed through two editions, and been generally accepted on the Continent as well as in England as the best manual of this difficult language. With characteristic modesty, the author left the words \"from the German of Caspari\" on the title, even of the second edition (1874), though the book is substantially an independent work.\n\nNo notice of Prof. Wright would be complete without reference to his great influence over his pupils, and the strong feelings of personal attachment with which he inspired them. Indeed, his considerate kindness, his constant helpfulness, his placid enthusiasm for learning, and the strong *esprit de corps* which made him instinctively treat every student of Eastern languages as a comrade, gained for him the hearts of younger Orientalists, whether they were his pupils or not. In his later years he had an almost cosmopolitan position, as the man whom all Eastern scholars knew and loved, to whom every one turned for help and advice, and who was never found wanting. His long struggle with fatal disease was watched with sympathetic interest in every seat of learning, and his death was mourned as a personal loss in every University of Europe. The value which was attached to his work, and the esteem in which his character was held wherever Eastern studies are appreciated, were marked by a long series of distinctions conferred on him by foreign Universities and Academies. Of these perhaps the Honorary Doctorship of Leyden and the Prussian Order pour le m\u00e9rite,\nwere those which he most prized, coming as they did from the countries in which his first years of Oriental study were spent, and where his first personal relations with foreign scholars were formed.\n\nIt ought to be mentioned in conclusion that Dr. Wright was an active member of the Old Testament Revision Company, and did much good service in their important work.\n\nIV. Notes and News.\n\nThe Professorship of Arabic at Cambridge, vacant by the lamented death of Professor Wright, has been filled up, in accordance with general expectation, by the appointment of Professor Robertson Smith. It is understood that a separate readership in Syriac will be created.\n\nProfessor Windisch, of Leipzig, who has been seriously ill, is now convalescent. His edition of the Iti-vuttaka, for the Pali Text Society, is now all in type.\n\nThe first volume of the Digha Nik\u0101ya, being edited by Professors Rhys Davids and Estlin Carpenter, for the Pali Text Society, is now all printed, except the indices, and will form part of the issue to the subscribers for this year.\n\nFather Guesdon, of Kamboja, has prepared and will shortly publish a dictionary of the Khmer language.\n\nProfessor Lefmann, of Heidelberg, has been staying for a short time in London. His edition of the Lalita Vistara, on which he has been working for many years, is now all in print; but the various readings and indices have still to be completed. Prof. Lefmann is engaged also on a biography of Franz Bopp.\n\nProfessor B\u00fchlcr has published at Vienna (Tempsky) a monograph, 'Ueber das leben des Jaina m\u00fcnches Hemachandra,' which goes carefully through all the authorities, and sets forth all that is known about this distinguished scholar and religious leader, the most important personage in Gujar\u0101t in the twelfth century of our era. We hope in a future issue to give a complete account of the conclusions at which Professor B\u00fchlcr arrives.\nProf. Blumhardt.\u2014Mr. Blumhardt, the author of the Catalogue of Bengali Books in the British Museum, has been appointed Professor of Hindust\u0101ni at University College, in place of Professor Keane, who has resigned.\n\nThe Rig Veda.\u2014One volume of the new edition of the Rig-Veda, with the Commentary of S\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101k\u0101rya, is finished, and will be laid before the International Congress of Orientalists at Stockholm by Prof. Max M\u00fcller. The new edition is printed at the expense of His Highness Sir Pasupati Ananda Gajapati Raz of Vizianagram. Several new MSS. have been collated, and considerable emendations have been made in the text. Prof. Max M\u00fcller has secured the assistance of Dr. Winternitz; and it is hoped that the four volumes, consisting of about 1000 pages quarto, will be ready in three years.\n\nSinhalese Literature.\u2014Members of the Royal Asiatic and Pali Text Societies may be interested to know that, while English scholars have been \u201clingering shivering on the brink\u201d of the \u201cOcean\u201d of stories in the J\u0101taka-book, the Sinhalese translation has completed its third part and 520th page. Other publications of scholarly interest recently printed in Ceylon are editions of the Visuddhimagga, with two unpublished commentaries, and the Hor\u0101bhara\u1e47a, Sanskrit with Sinhalese translation; also new editions of the Abhidhammathasangaha, Vuttodaya, and \u00c7abdabinduva.\u2014C. Bendall.\n\nThe American Oriental Society has sent out circulars to its members instructing them to gather all obtainable information concerning Oriental manuscripts in the public and private libraries of America, with a view of publishing a complete catalogue of such, as is done by the great libraries of Europe. The information to be gathered is intended to include all the ancient and modern languages and dialects of Asia, with those of Egypt and Ethiopia, without regard to the subject-matter, the character of the writing, material, state of preservation, and the length or size of them.\n\nAntiquarian Treasures.\u2014A resolution appears in the Gazette of India dealing with the preservation of anti-\nquarian treasures. Previous resolutions are quoted, which show that the Government has never claimed any indefeasible rights in archaeological objects, and that no such right could be asserted without legislation. The present resolution, however, says:\u2014This is true in regard to all objects of archaeological interest of which the discovery could not be brought within the scope of the Treasure Trove Act. But it appears to the Governor-General in Council that a material portion of discovered antiquities will be ascertained on inquiry to have been found in circumstances which would bring them under the provisions of Act VI. of 1878. Such will be the case in respect to all ownerless antiquities of any value \"hidden in the soil, or in anything affixed thereto.\" Statuary and remains of buildings, as well as coins, would, if buried underground, usually satisfy the required conditions, and could be classed as treasure under the definition of the Act which, as indicated by the extracts quoted in the Appendix, was intended by its framers to apply to objects of antiquarian interest discovered below the surface of the soil. Indeed, the definition of treasure as framed in the original Bill was enlarged by the Select Committee for the express purpose of covering sculptures and similar antiquities as well as coins. The Treasure Trove Act permits the Government to claim the possession of treasure of which, as laid down in Section 4 of the Act, the amount of value is over ten rupees. Such \"value\" is not, as in Section 16, the price which the mere materials of the article found would fetch, but the market value or the price which the discovered object might, if offered for sale, reasonably be presumed to realize. The conditions under which the finder of treasure is to be compensated in cases where the claim of Government is asserted are described in Section 16 of the Act. The value at which the treasure is to be assessed is there defined as the value of the materials only, plus one-fifth of such value. The extra price which the discovered article might realize in virtue of its value as an object of archaeological interest need not enter into account. It will not therefore be difficult to secure for\npreservation in national institutions the most important antiquities which may be discovered in any part of British India, without inordinate expenditure. The Governor-General in Council now desires that the conditions under which the Government can claim articles of antiquarian interest should be made generally known, as well to the officials upon whom the responsibility rests of giving effect to the provision of the Treasure Trove Act as to the general public. His Excellency in Council is convinced that the Local Governments and Administrations will, on every occasion on which it may be considered proper to exercise the rights conferred by the law upon the State, act with proper consideration for the natural claims and expectations of the finders of treasure, and will bear in mind that the object in view will be defeated if those who may discover objects of Archaeological value are not induced by the prospect of a sufficient reward to make their discoveries known to the officials of Government. On the other hand, it must be enjoined on all servants of the State that it is their duty to protect national interests so far as to ascertain the particulars of any discovery which may be brought to their notice, and to report the circumstances to the proper authorities under such rules and instructions as may be laid down for their guidance by the Local Government or Administration.\n\nV. Reviews.\n\nElementary Arabic. Part I. By F. D. Thornton. (Allen and Co.)\n\nSo well-intended, almost sympathetic, and, in some sense, ingeniously expressed an exposition of Elementary Arabic as that of Mr. Frederic Dupr\u00e9 Thornton, deserves every encouragement, but even the author himself would perhaps feel as much surprise as gratification to find his method of instruction approved in every respect by the majority of scholars and students whom it may concern. To facilitate the study of the language in question, with its mathematically precise\nyet essentially intricate grammar, difference of opinion must exist as to the better way, and this difference will at once become apparent in elementary as well as in advanced treatises by independent writers. Nothing, for example, can be simpler, shorter, or less pretentious in form than the present publication. Practically, it consists of ten pages only; for if out of the sixty-four which constitute the whole book we deduct the Preface and Appendix, there remain no more than this number. They set forth the native alphabet and corresponding English letters, and explain a system of transliteration which, however Indian in principle, we believe to be sufficiently sound for ordinary purposes, and more appropriate for ordinary learners than one of stricter science or minuter crudition. But the exposition is suggestive of objections, the nature of which will be made evident if exception be taken to the results of the author's experience in certain matters of detail.\n\nIn the first place it becomes a question whether Mr. Thornton does well in omitting to insert an English equivalent for his \"alif,\" which the late Professor Palmer, like his predecessors, Lumsden, Richardson, De Saey, Stewart, and others, found in a simple \"a,\" defining, in an explanatory note, its value according to position at the commencement of a word or following a consonant. Be it also noted that when this same letter afterwards appears, as an equivalent to the vowel-point \"fathah,\" not one of the three words (aunt, wan, and thumb), intended to illustrate its pronunciation, gives the sound contemplated by Palmer in his single word fat. Secondly, no good object is, it is conceived, gained by underlining, for distinction, single letters as those which are double: for such the dot seems preferable. Thus, while th, kh, dh, sh, gh, and zh would, where necessary to prevent confusion, retain the line, h, d, t and z would be under-dotted. But kh, sh, and gh are perhaps obvious enough as representing single letters to need no distinguishing mark at all, when brought down from the column of alphabetic equivalents into general use. Thirdly, the c, with the sedilla, can hardly be requisite for the letter \u00e7\u00e1d when the s so readily takes its place; and why should not k,\ninstead of the meagre \\( q \\) for \\( q\u00e1f \\), be also included among the under-dotted letters? We should then have, under a uniform system, six of the last-named, i.e. \\( \u1e25 \\), \\( \u1e63 \\), \\( d \\), \\( \u1e6d \\), \\( z \\), and \\( k \\). There could be no valid reason to prevent \\( \u1e63 \\) from having the power of \\( q \\), or \\( k \\) the power of \\( q \\), if these particular sounds were indeed indispensable; but the sedilla in French and the \\( q \\) in English do not convey the precise utterance required. Take the two words \\( savo\u00efr \\) and \\( fa\u00e7on \\), and you cannot insist that\u2014as Mr. Thornton expresses it for his \\( \u1e63\u00edn \\) and \\( \u1e63\u00e1d \\) respectively\u2014the \\( s \\) \u201cis pronounced with the tongue\u2019s tip, in contrast to\u201d the \\( q \\), \u201cwhich is said further back with broad of tongue.\u201d De Sacy uses \\( s \\) and \\( q \\) both to express the sound of each of the two Arabic letters, thus disavowing the particular distinction presumed by later Arabists to exist. He says, however, that the \\( s\u00e1d \\) (sic in orig.) \u201cdoit \u00eatre articul\u00e9 un peu plus fortement . . . on avec une sorte d\u2019emphase.\u201d Palmer writes \\( \u1e63\u00e1d \\), and explains that his equivalent \\( \u1e63 \\) is \u201ca lisping \\( s \\).\u201d As for \\( q \\), that letter is so abnormal in its severance from \\( u \\), that it is difficult to invest it with specific phonetic value, much more to accept the otherwise intelligible instruction contained in the brochure under notice, that it \u201cmay be said at first as \\( g \\) in go, and with practice the student will harden the sound in the direction of \\( k \\).\u201d\n\nAgain, the student-reader is instructed, with reference to sounding the letter \\( r \\), that \u201cFor \\( karm \\), \u2018vine,\u2019 it is better to say \\( karam \\) than \\( k\u00e1m \\) (like calm).\u201d But would Englishmen who have broken ground in the study of Arabic or other Oriental tongues pronounce \\( karm \\) as \\( k\u00e1m \\)? Taking \\( harm \\), \\( farm \\) and \\( alarm \\), as precedents, they would; but only in their acceptance as English words. The consequence, moreover, of giving a second syllable to the first of these would be the formation of a word long since adopted in the English language as \\( h\u00e1ram \\) or \\( h\u00e1rem \\), pronounced by the million \\( h\u00e1yram \\), a melancholy corruption of the true \\( harim \\).\n\nOne more suggestion is, that the \\( \u2018ain \\) might convey a clearer notion to the learner in the equivalent (\\( \u2018a \\)), than as a mere aspirate (\\( \u2018 \\)). It was thus interpreted by De Sacy.\n\nThese few remarks apply wholly to Mr. Thornton\u2019s ten\npages of original proposals for teaching Elementary Arabic. They are important, inasmuch as they relate to the foundation-stones of his system. Why this has been called Indian in principle, will be fairly evident from his quasi-rejection of the Turko-Persian letter e, \"commonly used,\" as he shrewdly puts it, \"when the writer is not sure of his grammar and doubts which vowel to employ.\" His Appendix, containing passages from the Kur\u00e1n, and analysis, should be useful to the many, and the parsing has been done with apparent care and ability. It will, however, be observed at a glance, that the numerous references to Wright's Grammar render it imperative upon the serious reader of this particular section of \"Elementary Arabie, Part I.\" that, to insure apprehension of the pages before him, he should be provided with means of ready access to the valuable work of the lamented Arabic Professor at Cambridge.\u2014F.J.G.\nART. X.\u2014The Avars. By H. H. Howorth, Esq., M.P., M.R.A.S.\n\nIn the following paper I propose to myself to write a monograph upon the Avars, from the time they are first mentioned by Western historians to their final disappearance from history. The detail, and I hope the completeness, with which I have ventured to treat the subject, which are alone of value in ethnographic studies now-a-days, are especially valuable in the case of the Avars, whose place in history was so marked and yet so enigmatic, and who caused such potent changes in the ethnographic map of Europe.\n\nI do not propose to myself to treat of the origin of the race, and of its earlier history in Asia. That I must postpone to another occasion. I would merely say here that in regard to the Avars, properly so called, I consider De Guignes's conclusion to be unanswerable, and that they are to be identified with the Jeoujen or Yuan Yuan of the Chinese histories, a race which dominated nomadic Asia before the Thu kiu or Turks asserted their preponderance in the sixth century. The coincidences and the convergency of evidence make this identification very nearly a certainty. I also hold the Jeoujen or Yuan Yuan, and consequently the Avars properly so called, to have been Mongols by race, as I believe the true Huns to have been\u2014Huns and Avars answering, in fact, to the two great sections of the Mongol race, the Mongols proper and the Kalmuks. The native\nname of the Kalmuks is Uirat, written Avirathei by Bar Hebr\u00e6us. The \\( t \\) in these names is merely the Mongol plural; and when we discard it, we in fact get a mere form of the name Var or Avar.\n\nI do not propose in the present paper to carry this analysis further, and will at once turn to the first notice of the Avars contained in a Western writer, which is more than a hundred years before the Avars invaded Europe.\n\nThe first time the Avars are mentioned is in the pages of Priscus, whose words are:\n\n\u201cAbout that time (i.e. 461\u2013465) the Saraguri, the Urogi (probably a corruption of Uguri), and the Onoguri, sent envoys to the Eastern Romans. These tribes had been thrust out of their country after a struggle with the Sabiri, whom the Avars had driven out. The Avars themselves had been driven out by the peoples dwelling near the ocean, who had been forced to migrate by the great clouds and mists which rose from the sea, and by a great hostile multitude of griffons, creatures who, it was reported, were not in the habit of withdrawing until they had eaten human beings. Excited by these calamities, they (i.e. the Avars) had fallen upon their neighbours, and all who could not resist their attack succumbed. It was thus that the Saraguri, compelled to seek new quarters, approached the Hunni Akatiri, with whom they fought several battles and whom they defeated, and then repaired to the Romans, eager for their alliance. The Emperor received their envoys courteously and sent them back again, after giving them presents\u201d (Priscus, Excerpta, Bonn ed., p. 158; Suidas, s.v. Abaris, who follows Priseus).\n\nThis passage, if it be trustworthy, and I see no reason to doubt it, is certainly one of the most important for the ethnographer to be found in ancient literature, for it is the sole record of one of those great race movements which have been such important factors in rearranging the ethnographic distribution of man. Whatever caused the movement of the Avars, whether some great natural phenomena, or, as is more probable, the growing power of the race, we read here how they first attacked and drove forward the\nSabiri, whom I hope to treat of in another paper, and how this led to other displacements of nomads. The main fact to remember is that the Avars thus became masters apparently of the Asatic Steppes as far west as the Volga, while a number of tribes, such as the Sabiri, Saraguri, etc., crossed that river into Europe, where we next meet with them.\n\nTo revert to the Avars. We do not read of them again until the year 557, when the power of the Jcoujen, whom I have identified with them, came to an end in Asia. Hitherto, as Theophylactus says, the Avars had been deemed among the Seythians as supreme. Their power was shattered by an outbreak of their former subjects the Turks. The same author tells us that the Turks in their progress conquered the Ogor, i.e. the Uighurs, a powerful race living on the river Til (i.e. the Volga). The old chiefs of the Ogor had been styled Var and Khunni, whence several of their tribes were named Var and Khuuni (i.e. Avar and Hun). That is to say, the Ogors were under the domination of the Avars. On the approach of the Turks, a portion of these tribes fled into Europe, gave themselves the name of Avarcs, and styled their leader Khagan. They were not true Avarcs, however, he says, but pseud-Avarcs (op. cit. vii. 8), i.e. Ogors or Uighurs led by Avar chiefs. On their approach, the Sarselt, Unuguri, Sabiri, and other Hunnic tribes, were greatly disturbed, fancying they were the real Avars, and offered them ample presents (id.).\n\nThe full meaning of this is that when the power of the Avars proper, that is, the Uirats, was broken in Eastern Asia, a portion of their subjects, namely the Ogors, whose chiefs were of Avar and Hunnic blood, adopted the name Avars and migrated. Those fugitives who went westwards were doubtless merely led by chiefs of Mongol descent, and in this sense the statement of the Byzantine writers is correct, that they derived their name from their leaders. The great bulk of the fugitives were doubtless of Turkish race, and not Mongols, whence Theophylactus styles them pseud-Abares, and refers to their appropriating to themselves the renown of the Avars proper, i.e. the Uirats. In-\nasmuch as they were horsemen, they, in all probability, belonged to the Altaic branch of the great race of Turan, and, as I believe, to the Uighur section of the Altaic race.\n\nI cannot see any reason for doubting the precise statement of Theophylactus, and we may tentatively conclude that the Avars who invaded Europe were a race of Uighur Turks commanded and led by chiefs and leaders of Kalmuk blood. The Slaves called them obri, which Jiresek says in lapse of time has come to mean a giant, Bohemian obr, Lusatian hobr, Polish olbrzym (Jiresek, Gesch. der Bulg. p. 86). To continue, we read that in the 31st year of Justinian, i.e. in 557, the fugitives at length reached the country of the Alani, i.e. the country north of the Caucasus, probably as far as the Don, which was at this time dominated over by the Alans, the modern Ossetes. They asked Sarosius, or Sarodius (a name also read Saroas, Lebeau, vol. ix. p. 376, note 2), the chief of the Alans, to put them in friendly communication with the Romans. He accordingly informed Justin, the son of Germanus, who commanded the garrison of Lazica, and he in turn informed Justinian, who ordered their envoys to be sent on to him at Byzantium (Menander, ch. i. ed. Bonn, p. 282). They accordingly selected Kandikh as their ambassador, and he went with a considerable cort\u00e8ge. The aspect of the strangers aroused a good deal of curiosity, and we are told that the city was filled with people to see them. They wore their hair in long plaits tied with ribbons, and hanging down their backs; otherwise, their appearance was like that of the Huns (Theophanes, ed. Bonn, p. 359, notc), whose hair was cut short and completely shaved off in front. These plaited locks of the Avars are referred to by more than one author. Corrippus, Laud. Just. Min. (preface, line 4), speaks of the Avarian race, with its hair twisted like snakes. Florilegius, the epigrammatist, talks of the long-haired Avarian army, and Calliades speaks of the dirty tresses of the Avars (Stritter, vol. i. p. 645, notc). John of Ephesus also speaks of \"those with long hair called Abaroi\" (op. cit. ed. Sch\u00f6nfelder, lib. iii. ch. xxv.). He also says they were called Avars from their hair (id. lib. vi. ch. xxiv.).\nKandikh put a bold face upon matters, and addressed Justinian in swaggering tones: he said, \"The most valiant and numerous race, that is, the race of the Avars, unvanquished and unconquerable, was come to submit to him. It could repel and destroy all his enemies. It was his interest therefore to ally himself with them, and to enter into a pact with them, and thus to secure the best of help. They asked no other reward for their services than that he should give them precious gifts, annual pensions, and a fertile district in which to settle.\" Justinian was now old, and besides, was overwhelmed with the pestilence and the earthquakes that were then desolating the East, and with the concurrence of the senate, he presented the envoys with chains encrusted with gold, in shape like those which were used for manacling prisoners, eowehes, and silken robes. John of Ephesus (lib. vi. ch. xxiv.) also speaks of golden saddles and bridles. He then dismissed them, and also sent Valentinus as his envoy, with suitable presents, to make an alliance with them and secure their aid against their enemies, indifferent whether they were defeated or victorious, as in either case the pressure on the eastern frontier would be relieved. The Avars accordingly fell upon the Utiguri and the Sali (a Hunnic tribe), and overthrew the Sabiri (Menander, op. cit. 282-284), all living in the steppes north of the Caucasus.\n\nThe Avars by this conquest no doubt became masters of the many Hunnic tribes in the Russian steppes. We next read of their falling upon the Slavic tribe of the Ant\u00e6, whose land they wasted. The latter thereupon sent them an embassy; this was headed by Mezamir (perhaps, according to Schafarik, Nezamir), the son of Idarisias, the brother of Celagast, or Cyeligost (the termination of the name Idarisias Schafarik compares with the Russian patronymic form ic or i\u010d), who was to ask to be allowed to redeem some prisoners the Avars had captured. Mezamir, who was a vain man, when he was admitted to an audience, broke out in the proud and arrogant language of menaei. Kotragegos (a variant has Kotriguros, by which name a Kotrigur is doubtless meant;\nHunfalvy suggests he was the chief of the Kotrigurs), who was a vassal of the Avars, advised them that Mezamir, being a very important man among the Ant\u00e6, he could persuade them to attack their enemies vigorously; it would therefore be well to kill him and then to make an attack boldly on the unfriendly state. The Avars took this counsel, and, in spite of Mezamir's character of ambassador, put him to death, and afterwards began to lay waste the land of the Ant\u00e6, carrying off plunder and prisoners (Menander, op. cit. pp. 284\u20135).\n\nNestor has preserved a vague tradition of these conquests. He tells us how, about the reign of Heraklius, the Obres attacked the Slaves, and won a victory over the Duliebians (who lived between the Bug and the Styr), and violated their women. He adds that when an Obre wished to drive out, he did not harness either horses or oxen to his carriage, but yoked three, four, or five women to it, who were obliged to draw it (Nestor, ed. Louis, Paris, vol. i. p. 10; Schafarik, vol. ii. pp. 58\u201359).\n\nWe now find the Avars sending envoys to Justinian to ask him to point out the district where he intended them to settle. The Emperor, persuaded by Justin, offered them the country formerly inhabited by the Heruli, known as the Second Pannonia, a very safe offer, since it was then occupied by warlike tribes who did not acknowledge any one's political supremacy over them; but they were not disposed to quit Scythia, by which no doubt the country of the Nogais west of the Volga and north of the Danube is meant, and not Little Scythia, or the Dobruja, as several writers have supposed, for the negotiations were carried on through Justin, the governor of Lazica. Justin, although vexed at their decision, sent the envoys on to Constantinople. He had previously won over one of the envoys named Oeconimos, who, as Thierry says, was probably a Greek from one of the Pontic cities, who told him secretly that the Avars had one sentiment on their lips and another in their hearts; that they would speak fairly until they were allowed to cross the Ister, but had a sinister policy in view afterwards, and once over the river, they would not fail to employ all their forces\nvigorously. Justin duly informed his master, and advised him to detain the envoys as long as possible, for the Avars would not cross the Ister until their envoys returned. Steps were now taken to guard the river, and Bonus, a commander of the domestic guards, was appointed to command its garrisons. The envoys, finding they could not obtain what they wished, having received gifts from the Emperor, as was customary, bought such things as they needed, and also some arms, and returned again. The Emperor secretly ordered Justin that by some means or other he must take these arms from them. He accordingly did so; hence arose an ill-feeling between the Romans and the Avars. The chief of the latter, Bayan, had been further annoyed at the detention of his envoys, and sent to hasten their return, which only made Justinian more anxious to detain them (Menander, pp. 285-6). For an explanation of the unusually brave conduct of the Emperor we have to turn to another chronicler, namely, the chronographer Theophanes, who tells us how Askel, the ruler of the Hemikhiones, identified with the Turks by Theophanes, at this time sent an embassy to Justinian. This no doubt informed him of the state of things in the further east and of the real status of the pseud-Avars. These events took place probably in the year 558 (see Lebeau, vol. ix. p. 381, and note 1 by Saint-Martin). Up to this point I have small doubt that the Avars were living in the country comprised between the Volga and the Danube, and were limited on the south by the Caucasus. The Kutrigurs and Utigurs were probably tributary to them, as were the other Hunnic tribes as far as the Danube, and also the different Slavic tribes of Southern Russia.\n\nThe Avars by these conquests no doubt became complete masters of Little Russia and the Ukraine, and of the nomads who lived in the grassy steppes where the Nogai Tartars afterwards nomadized. Their stay here was, however, apparently short-lived. The Turks, who had broken their power in Asia, still threatened them, and they were too powerful and aggressive a foe to be parleyed with. We consequently find them migrating further west, dragging with them\nportions of the Hunnic races whom they had conquered. The Sabiri apparently joined them in large numbers, and from this time the power of that famous tribe apparently waned very much in the country they had once dominated north of the Caucasus. The rest doubtless remained tributary to the Avars, as did the Kutrigurs and Utigurs. West of the latter, on the plains of Moldavia and Bessarabia, and probably also in Transylvania and Eastern Hungary, as far the Theiss, there at this time dominated the Hunnugars or Bulgarians, who were the masters of the Slavini. They were apparently independent of the Avar Khan, who now moved with his own people into the country north of the Carpathians.\n\nBefore following them in their migration westwards, we must say a few words about a portion of the race which remained behind; for, like other nomadic hordes which have invaded Eastern Europe from Asia, they apparently dropped a portion of their people in the cul-de-sac formed by the Caspian, the Euxine, and the Caucasus.\n\nAt all events, we find in the mountains of Lesghistan tribes named Avar and Khunsag, and, according to Klaproth, many of the names which are borne by them are the same as those of Hunnic chiefs. The list of these names, as given by him, is as follows:\n\n| Hunnic Names | Names in use among the Lesghian Avars |\n|--------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Attila       | Adilla, a very common man's name.    |\n| Uld, Uldin   | Uldan, an Avar family.               |\n| Budak        | Budakh Sultan.                       |\n| Ellak        | Ellak.                               |\n| Dingitsik    | Dingatsik, a family name.            |\n| Eskam, wife of Attila | Eska, a woman's name. |\n| Balamir      | Balamir.                             |\n| Almus        | Armaus.                              |\n| Leel         | Leel.                                |\n| Tsolta       | Solta.                               |\n| Geysa        | Gaissa.                              |\n| Zarolta      | Zarolta.                             |\n| Beled        | The Lesghian chiefs still use this title. |\nIn the dialect of the Lesghian Avars a river is called or, hor, or wor. Jornandes, chapter lii., tells us: \"Pars hunnorum in fugam versa, eas partes Scythiae petiit, quas Danubii annis fluenta pr\u00e6termeant, quae lingua sua Hunni var appellant\" (one MS. has Danabii instead of Danubii, Klaproth, Tableaux historiques, p. 246). This shows that among the Lesghian Avars the name for water is the same as that used by the ancient Huns. Again, til meant 'blaek' in Avarian. Amongst the Antsukh, Char, and Andi dir= 'black'; vokolabras amongst the ancient Avars meant 'grandparent'; among the Ingushes voko, and among the Lesghs of Antsukh, vokhula means 'great.' Among the recorded Avar names, those of Bayan, Samur, Solakh, and Kokh occur among the Lesghs and Mitsdjegi. These resemblances are so remarkable that they point very strongly, as Klaproth urges, to these tribes of the Caucasus having been either Avars or mixed with the debris of that nation (Klaproth, Recherches, etc., p. 268).\n\nIn regard to these Avars of the Caucasus, they comprise about 14,700 households, which would make up about 80,000 souls. Their dialect is considerably different from the other Lesghian dialects. The chief of the nation styles himself Avar Khan, and he was the most powerful of the rulers of the Eastern Caucasus. They occupy the valleys intervening between the Chetsenses on the west, and the territory of the Shamkal of Tarku on the east, while the Terek bounds them on the north. St.-Martin suggests that the name given to the tribe by the Russians was really the title of their chief. The Armenians and Georgians call them Khunchagh. The Georgians always style the Avar Khan, Khundsagh batoni, i.e. the Lord of Khundsagh, while the natives themselves call him Khundsakh nuzahl. The name Avar Khan is in use among the other Lesghs and the Mussulmans. St.-Martin points out that the Armenian writers of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries refer to these Avars of the Caucasus as Huns, while Michel, the Syrian, in his universal history, calls them both Huns and Turks. It is curious that the part of Hungary where the Turkish Comans settled was called\nKunsag by the Magyars. In 1727 their chief was called Uma Khan. He then submitted to the Russians, and the travellers who then visited his country called him Usmei-Avar. His family was said to be very ancient, and one of his ancestors submitted to the Mongols in the thirteenth century, and was invested with his territory by Batu Khan. The chief of the Avars could put 2000 troops of his own in the field, and this force he could augment to 10,000 by means of the mercenaries in his service, and he was powerful enough to exact black mail from the Georgians in consideration of foregoing attacks upon them. This tribute was continued by the Russians after they had conquered Georgia (St.-Martin, Notes to Lebeau, vol. ix. pp. 404-406, notes). It is very probable that the amount of Avar or Hunnic blood among these mountaineers is not very large, and that the main body of the race is related to the other Lesghs, the Avar or Hunnic element being only a veneer, and of this it may well be, as St.-Martin suggests, that the greater part is rather descended from the Sabiri than from the Avars proper.\n\nKlaproth says we must beware of identifying the Lesghs in general with the Hunnic race. Those of Khundzakh were probably conquered by some Khan of the ancient Avars, on the destruction of whose power a portion of his people probably withdrew into the mountains of the Caucasus, where they founded the community of Avar, and where they mingled with the Lesghian inhabitants, whose language they adopted, preserving only some words of their own language, and their own proper names (op. cit. p. 246 note).\n\nLet us now turn to the history of the main body of the Avars. When driven or frightened by the Turks, they abandoned the Russian steppes, and migrated westwards, taking with them a following of various Hunnic and probably also Slavic tribes. They did not pass immediately into Hungary, but withdrew apparently through Gallicia into the flat lands between the Baltic and Carpathians, and there they apparently formed a considerable power and caused a considerable race movement. As I have argued in some papers\non the spread of the Slaves, read before the Anthropological Institute, I believe the Sorabians or Serbians of Lusatia were so called from a Hunnic caste which ruled them, namely, the Sabiri, and these Sabiri doubtless entered Lusatia at this time. The Obodriti, whom I have also argued were also a Hunnic caste ruling over Slaves, invaded the valley of the Elbe at this time, and, as I believe, under the auspices of the Avars, occupying the lands which the migration of the Lombards, the Vandals, and the Angles, etc., had left vacant. I would also explain as due to this influence of the Avars the movement of the Chekhs into Bohemia, the former home of the Marcomanni, which apparently also took place at this time. Sehafarik confesses the difficulty of fixing the date of this Chekh occupation, and puts it somewhere after 450 A.D., when the Marcomanni went westward at the heels of Attila. I hope to revert to this important race movement in a later paper on the Sabiri.\n\nThe importance of the Avarian domination under such an active chief as then ruled them has hardly been sufficiently appreciated. It led no doubt to raids in various directions, and to the settlement of many colonies of Slaves (so frequently called Huns in the old writings, doubtless because they had Hunnic leaders) in the country west of the Elbe. This I have pointed out in detail in the paper already cited on the Northern Serbs and the Obodriti.\n\nThe next time the Avars are mentioned in history, they are found in active conflict with the Franks. Gregory of Tours calls them Huns, while Paul the Deacon describes them as \"Hunni qui et Avarae\" (op. cit. vol. ii. p. 10). In another place he says, \"Alboin vero eum Avaribus qui primum Hunni, postia de regis propri\u00e2 nomine Avarae appellati sunt\" (Paul. Diae. i. 27). We read that after the death of Clothaire, i.e. in 562 A.D., Sigebert, who was his fourth son, and who succeeded to the throne of Austrasia, marched against and defeated the Huns who had invaded his borders. Paul the Deacon tells us the struggle took place near the river Elbe in Thuringia, a proof of the western extension of the Avarian domination at this time (see\nGregory of Tours, Hist. Franc. vol. iv. p. 234; Paul. Diac. i. ii. c. 10; Thierry Hist. d'Attila, etc., vol. i. p. 390).\n\nThe Avars were at this time led by a chief whom, if we knew more of, we should probably compare with Attila and Chinghiz Khan. His name was Bayan, which, it will be remembered, was the name of a famous Mongol chief. We now find him having diplomatic intercourse with Justin, the nephew of Justinian, who succeeded his uncle as Emperor in the year 565. Justin was a very conceited person, and affected a haughty demeanour towards his neighbours, which was ridiculous, because unsupported by any real power. As Thierry says, he posed before the Avars like Marius did before the Teutons, and addressed the Persians in the language of Trajan; but unfortunately this Trajan had no genius, and this Marius no soldiers (op. cit. p. 391). On his accession Bayan sent envoys to Byzantium to receive the gifts which Justinian had been accustomed to give. Corippus, the panegyrist of Justin, has preserved an account of the reception of these envoys, of which he was a spectator.\n\n\"As soon as the Emperor, dressed in his purple robes,\" he says, \"had mounted the steps of the throne, the master of the ceremonies, having taken his orders, ushered the ambassadors into the palace. They traversed with astonishment the vestibules and long galleries which formed the threshold to the Imperial quarters. They halted at every step and admired the stature of the guards ranged in a double rank with their golden shields, their gold inlaid lances, and their golden helmets, from which hung down purple plumes. They started involuntarily at the serried lances and the battle-axes, and they asked if the Imperial palace was not another heaven; but, on the other hand, they were proud that they were themselves admired, and that the public gaze was upon them; and the poet compares their dignified walk to that of the Hyrcanian tigers when let out of their cages in the circus amidst the plaudits of the mob crowding the seats around. A veil being drawn aside disclosed ceilings thickly gilt, the throne and the sparkling diadem on the Imperial head. Thereupon Targites, or Targitius, the chief envoy,\nbent the knee three times, and saluted the Emperor by touching the ground three times with his head (surely a very Mongolian method of doing homage). The others followed his example, and the floor was inundated by the waves of their flowing hair.\" The envoys, according to Corippus, vaunted the renown of their race, whose sovereign, conqueror of the Imaus, the terror of the Persians, could, if united, drink up the waters of the Hebrus to the last drop (Corippus de Laudibus Justini, ed. Bonn, iii. 233, etc.; Thierry, vol. i. pp. 393-395).\n\nMenander tells us the envoys adopted a bold front, either to overawe the Emperor or in the hope of obtaining larger gifts. They reminded him that it was his duty to continue the policy of his predecessor, Justinian, towards his allies, and even to enlarge that Emperor's beneficence, in order that he might secure their good will in an equal measure to what he did. If he had been good to them, they had in turn been good to him. In the first place, they had refrained from pillaging his frontiers when it was well within their power to have done so, and had prevented others from doing so. Those who formerly were in the habit of ravaging Thrace no longer did so, being afraid of the Avars, whom they knew to be friends of the Romans. They urged that he should be more generous than his father, in order that their services might be similarly increased, and that if their chief was to be his friend, it depended on himself. They pressed this home partially by threats and partially by arguments, and spoke as if the Emperor was their tributary. Justin, we are told, deeming their words mere boasting, replied accordingly. He affected to despise their threats as much as he did their blandishments. He promised to do more for them than his father had done, and would teach them a lesson more valuable than his, for it would be more beneficial to them to show them how to restrain their arrogance. It was greater kindness to stop an impetuous temper which was hastening to its own ruin than to allow it to become the victim of its own caprice. \"Depart,\" he said, \"with this counsel; we have no need of your aid, nor have we paid\nyou anything except willingly, not as tribute but as a payment made to slaves\" (Menander, p. 286-289). The language reported by Menander is virtually the same as that of Corippus. \"You tell me, young man,\" the latter makes Justin say to the chief envoy, \"things which we do not believe, and in which you have been yourself misled by false rumours, if in fact you believe them yourself at all. You are relating mere dreams and illusions. Cease to boast of the exploits of mere fugitives. Spare me the recital of the glories of an exiled crowd looking vainly for a home. What powerful realm has it subdued when it could not defend itself?\" (Corippus, op. cit. iii. 310, etc., Thierry, i. 95).\n\nJohn of Ephesus says that, exasperated by their language, he called them dogs, and said he would cut their hair off and decapitate them (op. cit. lib. vi. ch. xxiv.). Justin's bold front seems to have imposed on the envoys, who were convinced that it would neither be possible for them to obtain a larger tribute, nor to successfully attack the Empire, and they accordingly returned home. John of Ephesus says Justin had them seized, put into boats, and conveyed to Chalcedon, to the number of 300 men, and that they were detained there for six months; they were then allowed to depart, with a threat that if any one of them was again found on Roman soil, he would be put to death (id.). At this time Bayan was engaged in a second campaign against the Franks, as Menander says (op. cit. 290). Gregory of Tours dates this campaign in the year 566. Sigebert marched against them with a large army; but at the moment when they were going to engage, the Avars (called Huns by Gregory), skilled in the art of magic, caused various phantoms to arise in front of the Franks, who were completely vanquished. Sigebert himself was made prisoner, but having an agreeable manner and address, \"he vanquished those by presents whom he could not defeat in battle,\" and his liberality induced \"the King of the Huns\" to agree with him that during the remainder of their lives they should not again fight together. \"The King of the Huns\" also made presents to Sigebert. Gregory of Tours\ntells us he was called \"Gagan (i.e. Khakan), a title which was borne by all the rulers of that nation\" (op. cit. iv. 29). The use of the necromancy just named is a parallel to that employed by the Mongol chief Batu Khan in Hungary, while the title of Khakan was precisely the title used by the Mongol chiefs. The peace with the Franks is also mentioned by Menander. He tells us that after it was made, Bayan, the leader of the Avars, informed Sigebert that his army was suffering from a want of provisions, and promised that if he would supply them, his people would move their camp on the third day, nor would they any longer remain there. Thereupon Sigebert sent some flour, beans or pulse, sheep and oxen, to the Avars (Menander, op. cit. 303).\n\nAt this time a large part of Hungary was divided between the two rival races of the Lombards and the Gepidae, the Danube forming their common frontier. The Lombards were planted to the west, and the Gepidae to the east of that river, and as far as the Theiss, east of which I believe the country was then dominated by the Hunugars or Bulgarians.\n\nAlboin, the king of the Lombards, who was Sigebert's brother-in-law, had determined upon the conquest of Italy, but feared to leave his dominions at the mercy of his eastern neighbours, the Gepidae. He therefore sent envoys to Bayan, inviting him to form an alliance with him. They urged upon him that they had been ill-used, not only by the Gepidae, but by the Romans, who were also enemies of the Avars. They wished accordingly not so much to attack the Gepidae as to fight against Justin, who had proved himself most unfriendly to the Avars, had set at naught the treaty they had made with his uncle Justinian, and deprived the Avars of their wonted presents. They urged further that in alliance with the Lombards they would be invincible, and when they had exterminated the Gepidae, they would divide their wealth and their lands between them. They would then be in a position to occupy Scythia (i.e. Little Scythia or the Dobruja) and Thrace, and carry their arms as far as Byzantium, adding, that if they meant to proceed, they had better do so\nat once, to prevent the Romans from forestalling them, and that they might depend on the implacable hatred of the latter in any event (Menander, pp. 303 and 304).\n\nBayan did not reciprocate these advances very warmly. He did not see what advantage it would be to his people. At one time he said he could not engage in such an enterprise, at another that he could, but was not willing to do so.\n\nHe kept them in suspense for some time, and at length consented on condition that the Lombards should make over to him at once a tithe of their cattle, and that, if they were successful in the war, one-half of the booty should belong to his people, while all the land of the Gepid\u00e6 should be ceded to them. Paul the Deacon merely tells us that Alboin made a perpetual pact with the Avars (i. 27). When Kunimund, the ruler of the Gepid\u00e6, heard of this league, he sent envoys to ask assistance from Justin, and offered to surrender to him the city of Sirmium and the district within (i.e. south of the Drave), which had been lost to the Romans for some time. Justin did not see how it would be of advantage to the Empire to enter into such a treaty, and eventually would promise nothing more than that he would be neutral (Menander, op. cit. pp. 304\u2013305). Having formed an alliance with the Lombards, Bayan proceeded to attack the Gepid\u00e6. We have no means of knowing exactly what route he followed in invading Hungary, but it is not improbable that he marched by the same route as that followed by the main army of the Mongol leader Batu Khan at a later date. Schafarik urges that this is probable since it would appear that Transylvania was conquered by the Avars from Hungary, and he makes the Avars invade the latter country through the Dukla Pass in the Carpathians (op. cit. vol. ii. p. 59).\n\nMenander does not describe what follows, and we are limited to the account of Paul the Deacon, whose statements are to be accepted largely as those of a panegyrist of the Lombards. He tells us that Kunimund, the king of the Gepid\u00e6, being threatened on one side by the Avars and on the other by the Lombards, determined first to attack the\nlatter. He was desperately beaten, and slain. Alboin, we are told, had a drinking cup made of his skull. This was doubtless a custom borrowed from his allies the Avars, since with the Mongol race it has been an ordinary incident of war (Paul. Diae. i. 27). This battle took place in the year 567 (see Waitz' note to his edition of Paul the Deacon). The Lombard chronicle tells us the Gepidae were so crushed that they ceased to exist as a nation, and no longer had any king; but those who remained either became subject to the Lombards or to the Avars, who seized their country, and who still held them in severe bondage when Paul wrote (op. cit. lib. i. ch. 27). The Avars now settled down and occupied the country of the Gepidae, which was apparently that part of Pannonia included between the Theiss and the Danube, having the Lombards as their western neighbours, and separated from the Roman Empire by the Danube. In my view there is no evidence that the Avars ever had any settlements east of the Theiss. The Romans, in attacking them at a later day under Priscus, had to cross the Theiss in order to reach their camps.\n\nBayan was not long in finding a subject of discord with the empire. Having defeated the Gepidae, he claimed to be their heir. In addition to their possessions north and east of the Danube, the Gepidae had also obtained a grant from Justinian of the district of Sirmium, including that city and the peninsula included between the Save and the Danube. When the power of the Gepidae was crushed in the war above described, the people of this district, most of whom were probably Roman peasants, placed themselves once more under the Roman empire, and a garrison was apparently sent to protect them (Lebeau, op. cit. vol. x. p. 29). Bayan, after securing the main portion of the Gepidan territory, claimed this also. One of his officers, Yobulidas, received 800 pieces of money from the Governor of Illyrium, but this did not appease him, and Justin, having sent Vitalian and Comitas to treat with him, he threw them into prison. He then proceeded to try and surprise Sirmium, but presently withdrew, apparently finding the place too strong for him,\nand sent some people to treat for terms. Some of the citizens, who were on the look out as usual, seeing a party of men advancing in the distance, fancied it was Bayan's army, but Bonus, seeing how matters stood, sent out some people to hold a colloquy. Bonus had been wounded in the recent fighting, and his doctor deemed it imprudent he should go out, nor was it thought wise to let the enemy know that he was in this condition; but, inasmuch as he did not appear, they concluded he was dead, and it was eventually decided he should go out to treat with them after his wounds had been dressed. Their envoy urged that the Avars had been badly treated by the Romans, who had withheld from them what was rightly theirs, and what they had conquered with infinite pains (i.e. the country of the Gepidae, including Sirmium). Usdibad (a Gepidan fugitive whom the Romans had sheltered) was similarly one of their subjects, and they had otherwise been badly used. Bonus replied that the Romans were far from desiring war, and that the Avars had been the aggressors, that the Emperor was not unwilling to treat them well, and had sent envoys to them, but they had behaved arrogantly and aggressively. In regard to their present demands, Bonus said it was not in his power to grant them without his master's approval, and they had better send envoys on to him. Bayan seems to have been reasonable in his reply; he urged that he would be ashamed of returning home again in the face of the various tribes whom he led, if he obtained nothing after so much effort, and asked at least for a small present. (Mcnander, pp. 306-307; Lebeau, vol. x. p. 308 and notes.)\n\nBonus and his companions, including the chief ecclesiastical dignitary in Sirmium, deemed Bayan's plea reasonable, and he only asked for a silver dish, some money, and a Scythian cloak. It was apparently deemed dangerous, however, to concede anything which might be treated as a tribute, and Bonus professed to be unable to do anything without the Emperor's leave, and urged further that being in camp, he had little money, and had nothing to give; the Romans there had merely their household furniture and the things\nthey wore, nor had they anything worthy of his acceptance; all their valuables were elsewhere and at a considerable distance. Bayan was irritated at this reply, and threatened to march his forces to lay waste the Roman territory. He ordered 10,000 Kutrigurs to cross the Save and lay waste Dalmatia, while he himself, recrossing the Danube, planted himself in the territory of the Gepidae.\n\nMeanwhile, apparently following the hint given him by Bonus, he sent Targitius (whose name, as Hopf remarks, is most singularly like that of Targitaos mentioned by Herodotus as a primitive hero of the Seythians) with the interpreter Vitalian, whom he had imprisoned, to demand the surrender of Sirmium, the payment to him of the sums formerly paid to the Kutrigurs and Utigurs, whose heir he claimed to be since he had conquered them, and lastly to demand the extradition of Usdibad, on the ground that, having conquered them, all the Gepidae were now his subjects. Targitius, addressing the Emperor, said he had come from Bayan, whom he styled the Emperor's son, and that he trusted he would grant him what was due to a son, and he then went on to enumerate his demands, the surrender of Sirmium, etc., as above. The Emperor professed to treat these demands as ridiculous. The money paid to the Kutrigurs and Utigurs, he urged, was due to the liberality and policy of Justinian, and was not a discharge of any claim. As to Usdibad, he must deem the Romans to be fools if he thought they were prepared to grant benefits to those who had previously wronged them. It was true that during the reign of his predecessor Justinian the Gepidae, who were wandering about, were permitted to settle in and occupy the region about Sirmium, and when a war broke out between them and the Lombards, the Romans, as was right, had helped their friends, and through their assistance the Gepidae had defeated their foes; nevertheless the latter had proved ungrateful and treated their benefactors treacherously. If justice must be done, it was the Romans who might demand that the Gepidae, who had formerly acknowledged their supremacy, should be made over to them and not that they,\nthe Avars, should be suing for the return of Usdibad. \"You say, O Targitius,\" continued the Emperor, \"that the Khakan will cross the Ister and even the Hebrus, and will occupy the towns of Thrace, but the Romans would speedily punish such an attempt, nor would they desist until the arrogance of the barbarians was subdued. War was a much more useful occupation to the Romans than peace. Of what service were bows and horses and an infinite number of armed men if not for fighting?\" With brave words like these the Emperor dismissed the Avarian envoys, at the same time he sent a message to Bonus, the Governor of Sirmium, scolding him for having permitted envoys with such demands to go to Byzantium, and ordered him to prepare everything in case of war. These events apparently took place in the year 568\u2013569 (Menander, 385\u2013389).\n\nIt was about this time that a famous race movement took place, which opened a still wider field to Avarian ambition, namely, the migration of the Lombards into Italy. This took place probably in the year 568 (see Waitz, note 5 to Paul the Deacon, lib. ii. ch. 7 and note 4 to ch. 10), and we are told they abandoned their own country, that is to say, Pannonia, to their friends the Huns, with this proviso, that if it should be necessary some time for them, i.e. the Lombards, to return, they were to have it again (Paul. Diac. lib. ii. ch. 7). We may perhaps read between the lines of Paul the Deacon that it was the pressure or dread of their friends the Avars that induced them to move. It is such pressure, and not mere sentiment, which has induced the great race changes of the world. On the departure of the Lombards, the Avars duly occupied their country. The occupation of the Lombard territory was only an episode with the Avars, whose dealings with the eastern empire meanwhile continued as before. Menander tells us that after several embassies had gone to try ineffectually to settle these disputes, the Emperor told Targitius that he would send Tiberius, who held the highest position in the army, with full power to treat and arrange matters. A colloquy it seems ensued between Tiberius on the Imperial side and Apsikh representing the Avars, and it was agreed\nthat the Romans would make over to the Avars the district which they occupied, if their principal chiefs would give their sons as hostages. The Emperor consented to this, but Bayan insisted naturally, for he deemed he was treating with an equal, that if hostages were to be given on one side, they should be given on the other also. To this condition Tiberius would not consent. His scheme contemplated that if Bayan should desire to invade the Roman border, the parents of the hostages would restrain him. The Emperor seems to have concurred in this view, and to have urged that it would be well to let the barbarians see a specimen of Roman valour and warlike prowess. Tiberius accordingly instructed Bonus to see to the river being properly guarded (Menander, op. cit. pp. 311, 312).\n\nThe issue was now one of arms. The details of what followed, however, are largely wanting. We are told that it was the custom of the Avars to advance against their enemies amidst the clashing of cymbals and loud cries. Tiberius warned his men of this, and ordered them to countercheck it by beating their shields together, and raising their war-cry louder than usual. But at the first charge of the barbarians, the raw Roman levies fled, and, says Evagrius, \"Tiberius himself would have been captured if providence had not preserved him to give this unfortunate century the example of a wise and virtuous Emperor.\" After their victory the Avars sent fresh envoys to Byzantium, with whom Tiberius sent Damian, to urge that the demands of the enemy should be granted. Peace was thereupon made, we are not told its terms; but Sirmiun, at all events, remained in Roman hands. As the Avar envoys were returning home, they were attacked by the Skamars, who were predatory robber-bands, made up of various nationalities, who infested the mountains of Noricum and probably also of Thrace. They stripped the envoys of their horses, money and other valuables. The latter complained of this to the Emperor, who sent after the robbers, recaptured the booty they had made, and restored a portion of it to the Avars (Menander, 312-13).\n\nJustin the Emperor died in the year 578, and was suc-\nceeded by Tiberius. In his second year the latter sent Valentinus as an envoy to the Turks. He had an interview with one of their chiefs, named Turxanth, and urged the object of his journey, namely, that the Turks should make common cause with the Romans against the Persians. The Turkish chief angrily replied that the Romans had ten tongues with which to proclaim their falsehoods. \"A lie is unknown among us, but is habitual with him who reigns over you; for while he addresses us friendly words, he makes a treaty with our slaves, the Varkhonit\u00e6 (i.e. the Avars), who have fled from their lord, these Varkhonit\u00e6, who at the sight of our whips would flee and try and hide themselves in the earth. If we wished to chastise them, it would not be with swords. We should trample them under the hoofs of our horses like ants. What mean you Romans by telling me my envoys must go by way of the Caucasus, and by saying there is no other route? You say this in order that the difficulties of the route may frighten me from invading the Roman frontier; but I know where the Dnieper, the Ister and the Hebrus flow, by which the Varkhonit\u00e6, our slaves, went when entering your land. I know your forces, ours also spread as widely as the course of the sun. Miserable creatures, look at the Alans, look also at the Utigurs. They were powerful and famous for their valour and courage. They were confident in the numbers of their troops. They dared to attack the invincible nation of the Turks. They were misled in their hopes. They have been conquered, and are numbered among our slaves\" (Menander, 400\u20131). These phrases are very interesting, since they prove to us most clearly that the Avars at this time had lost entire control of the eastern steppes of the Nogais. Nor had they retained much authority, apparently, west of the Dnieper, in the country occupied by the Slavini and the Bulgarians or Hunugars in Moldavia, Wallachia and Transylvania; for we are expressly told by Menander that the ruler of the Avars sent envoys to Daurita or Daurentios, i.e. Dobreta, and the other chiefs of the Slavini, to demand tribute from the Slavini. They thus replied to his summons: \"What man is there upon\nwhom the sun's rays shine who can claim to exert authority over us? We are wont to acquire dominion over others, and not others over us; rather let us appeal to our swords.\" These haughty words were answered by phrases equally haughty, and a strife having arisen, it ended in the Avarian envoys being put to death (Menander, op. cit. p. 406; Jiresek, pp. 87-8). This no doubt greatly irritated Bayan, and when, about the year 578, the Slavini made an invasion on a great scale and overran Thrace and Greece itself, as Menander, and more especially John of Ephesus relate, he was ready to listen to the overtures of the Romans for an alliance. The Emperor in his distress sent John the prefect, who had authority in the islands and cities of Illyricum, to him. Bayan not only had a private wrong to avenge, but, according to Menander, he hoped to find great stores of gold in the land of the Slavini, the product of their frequent raids upon the Empire, more especially as they themselves had not been molested and robbed by others. The prefect John, having reached Paeonia, had Bayan and his people ferried across the Danube in long boats. Sixty thousand armed cavalry were thus transported across. They marched along the southern bank of the Danube as far as Seythia (i.e. the Dobruja), where they again crossed the river on ships having a poop at either end. They thus crossed into the very heart of the land of the Slavini, and proceeded to ravage their villages and settlements. Their army being away on the borders of Greece, the wretched people who stayed at home had to seek shelter in the woods and caverns, and the invaders captured what booty they pleased (Menander, pp. 404-407). From another passage in Menander we gather that the Avars on this occasion liberated several thousand Romans, who had been kept in servitude by the Slavini (id. p. 334). The date of these events is not quite clear. John of Ephesus, who was a contemporary and who wrote his work in 584, has the phrase: \"In the third year after the death of the Emperor Justin (op. cit. lib. vi. ch. 25) and the accession of the valiant Tiberius.\" Menander also places the event in the reign of Tiberius. But\nthe editor of that work, as well as Hopf and Jiresek, seem to read these phrases as if the events really happened in the reign of Justin, but three years after Tiberius had been appointed Caesar and Regent (i.e. after 574). I confess I prefer the older interpretation virtually followed by Stritter, and to consider that the events really took place in the third year of Tiberius, i.e. about 580 A.D.\n\nShortly after this we read how Bayan sent Targitius for the accustomed tribute, which amounted to 80,000 pieces of money, and which was paid to him (Menander, p. 332). This tribute was doubtless the main condition of the peace we described above.\n\nThe ambitious ruler of the Avars had not forgotten his further claims upon Sirmium, which, as having belonged to the Gepidae, he deemed as by right his own. John of Ephesus tells us that he applied to the Emperor for a number of workmen to build him a palace and some baths. Tiberius sent them, whereupon he disclosed his real intentions, and tried to make them build a bridge across the Danube, by which he might invade the empire (op. cit. lib. vi. ch. xxiv.). John of Ephesus here mistook the Danube for the Save. Menander tells us that Bayan moved his army to the Save, and encamped near its outfall into the Danube, and opposite Singidunum (i.e. the modern Belgrade), and began to build a bridge across the Save. As the Romans had a powerful fleet on the Danube, he saw the necessity of having the same, and accordingly laid his hands upon as many barges and other boats for carrying merchandise as he could on the Danube in Upper Pannonia, and rudely constructed a number of others useful for his purpose, which was merely to transport his armed troops across, and he also trained some of his men as rowers. This fleet he sent along the Danube, and meanwhile marched with his infantry to the island of Sirmium (so called by Menander, i.e. the peninsula between the Save and Drave). These movements naturally alarmed the Romans. Seth, the governor of Singidunum, sent to inquire what his purpose was, when they were at peace, to bring his armament\nthere? If it was his intention to build a bridge over the river, it would not be permitted. Bayan replied that he had no ill designs against the Romans, but that in building a bridge across the river, it was to enable him to attack the Slavini. That having crossed the Save into the Roman territory, he would then beg the Romans to furnish him a sufficient number of boats in which to cross the Danube. The Romans, he said, were under obligations to him for having released so many of their prisoners, and he had a grievance of his own against the Slavini, who had refused to pay him tribute. He swore that he meant no harm to the Romans, nor yet to the town of Sirmium, which he called \"that cauldron,\" so named perhaps from its being partially built on an island, which had somewhat the round resemblance to a cauldron. In this behalf it is interesting to remember that the Tartar town, which replaced Bolghari on the middle Volga, was given the name of Kazan or the cauldron. Seth and the garrison of Singidunum had small faith in these promises, but he had only few men with him, nor had he many swift boats, i.e. war-galleys, to oppose the powerful barbarian, who now began to threaten that he would march on Rome, and said that if a single weapon was fired at the workmen engaged on the bridge, the peace must be deemed at an end, and the Romans must bear the consequences. Seeing there was no help for it, Seth and his people asked that the pacific utterances of the Khakan should be ratified by a solemn oath on his part. He drew his sword, and, raising it aloft, swore that if any harm came to the Romans in consequence of the bridge being built across the Save, he hoped his people might be exterminated by the sword, that heaven would fall upon them, that God, who dwelt there, would cast fire down upon them, that the woods and mountains around might fall upon and crush them, and that the waters of the Save might overflow and overwhelm them. Having sworn thus in his national fashion, he said he was prepared to do so in the Roman fashion also, and asked how they swore when they meant the wrath of God to come down upon those who failed in their promise. The senior\neclesiastic in Singidunum was thereupon ordered to produce the Bible, and it was conveyed to the Khakan, who rose from his throne tremblingly, and respectfully took the book, and on his knees swore by the God who had written the holy words it contained, that he would not break the promises he had made. The governor thereupon received his envoys, and sent them on to the Emperor. Pending their return, the work on the bridge was duly continued, all the Avarian army being occupied upon it, so that they should be independent of the Imperial consent, should it be withheld (Menander, pp. 332-336). The envoys, being admitted, asked the Emperor that boats might be furnished to the Avars upon which their army might cross the Danube and attack the Slavini, and declared that the Khakan had already begun to build a bridge across the Save so that he might assail their common enemies. The Emperor saw clearly what was meant, and that the bridge was intended to intercept communications between Sirmium and the empire, so that when thus blockaded the place might be reduced by famine; but, having no means of opposing the enemy, since his troops were all in Armenia and Mesopotamia, engaged in the Persian war, he dissimulated. He said he also wished to punish the Slavini, who had assailed and ravaged several Roman provinces; but it was not then an opportune time for the Avars to be contemplating such an expedition, inasmuch as the Turks were at that moment attacking the Chersonese (i.e. the Tauric Chersonese), and if they, the Avars, crossed the Danube, they would at once hear of it. It would therefore be better if they postponed their expedition. What the Turks were about and whither they proposed advancing he would shortly learn, and would take care to inform the Khakan. The Avar envoy saw that Tiberius meant to intimidate them by the mention of the Turks, but he professed to share his views, and promised to urge them upon the Khakan. Menander says it was he who had been chiefly instrumental in urging the Khakan to attack the Romans. Having received very large gifts, which he seems to have asked for, he left the Imperial city. As he passed through\nIllyrium, having only a small escort, he was attacked by the Slavini, who were making attacks on that district, and was killed. A few days after his departure a fresh envoy, named Solakh, arrived at Byzantium, who spoke openly and without disguise:\u2014\"I deem it superfluous to report that both banks of the Save are united by a bridge. You know it as well as I, and it is superfluous to tell people what they already know. The Romans cannot save Sirmium by any means, and the river being closed, there is no means of supplying it with food, unless they can send an immense force to drive out the Avars and break the bridge.\" He therefore, he said, came to ask the Emperor if it was worth his while to engage in war with the Avars for the sake of an insignificant town or rather, \"a cauldron.\" The Roman garrison and the citizens might leave the place with all their effects, and leave a vacant city for them. To be quite frank, the Romans, he said, were peaceably inclined at present, because their hands were full with the Persian war. When this was over, they would speedily attack the Avars, having this place as a base, and there being no wide river between them to protect them. It was very inconvenient to them, the Avars, to have this fortress close by. The Khakan enjoyed the gifts the Emperor sent him. Gold, silver and silks were good things in themselves, but life was dearer and more precious than all. The Romans had in these very districts distributed their gifts and largess to many peoples, whom they had afterwards attacked and destroyed. Consequently neither gifts, nor promises nor anything else would induce him to desist from his purpose, which was to possess himself of the peninsula of Sirmium, and he had a perfect right to do this, and to possess himself of it rather than the Romans, since, having conquered the Gepid\u00e6, their towns and property belonged to him. The Emperor was much distressed at these words, and declared the Khakan had deluded him by his oath, but that he would not comply with his demand. He would rather surrender to him one of his two daughters than willingly give up Sirmium to him, nor would God fail to avenge the Romans if the Khakan broke his oath and pro-\nceeded to attack the town. He thereupon dismissed the envoys, and ordered preparations to be made for defence. John of Ephesus says the Emperor sent Narses with an armament by sea to relieve the place, but on the way one of his ships with the chief part of the treasure sank in the Pontus, and on reaching the mouths of the Danube Narses died (op. cit. lib. vi. ch. xxxi.). He had few troops to depend upon, but sent orders to the various prefects and officers in Illyrium and Dalmatia to collect what forces they could and to march with them to the relief of the threatened town. When one of them named Thcognis\u2014John of Ephesus says Kallistros, the praefect of the Praetorians, had previously been sent to try and again treat with the Avars (op. cit. lib. vi. ch. xxxii.)\u2014arrived at Casia and Carbonaria, two small islands on the Save, a colloquy was arranged. Bayan, we are told, descending from his horse, sat on a golden seat surmounted by a canopy ornamented with precious stones and like a tent. A shield was held in front of him so that he might not be struck by some Roman weapon. Theognis and his companions were some distance away. The Avarian interpreters or heralds in a loud voice announced that there would be a truce during the interview. Then Bayan said it behoved that the Romans should surrender Sirmium without fighting, since there was no chance of their saving it, for not only was the town deficient in provisions, access to it being entirely cut off, but the Avars would never cease their exertions until they had captured it. He urged that he wished to have control of the place, so that deserters should not find shelter there. Theognis replied that he would not withdraw until the Avars did so, nor would Bayan easily compel the Romans to surrender what he demanded. These irritating words on either side ended by Thcognis bidding the Khakan prepare for battle on the morrow (Menander, 332\u2013342). This was only a piece of bravado on his part, for, as a matter of fact, he had not the force to support much boasting. For three days the Avars ranged themselves in battle array, and as their opponents did not appear, they lest such respect for them that the Avar\ndivision under Apsikh, which was in charge of a second bridge, cutting off the place from Dalmatia, did not deem it worth their while to remain there, but rejoined their countrymen at the other bridge. Meanwhile a dearth of provisions began to be felt in Sirmium. Solomon, who commanded in the town, was neither a vigorous administrator, nor had he any skill as a soldier, and the citizens, losing heart, laid all the blame of their calamities upon the Romans. When Tiberius learnt how matters stood, he sent orders that the town was to be surrendered on condition that all the inhabitants should be permitted to leave it safe and sound, but should take nothing with them except each man his life and one suit of clothes. These terms were accepted by the Avars. The Khakan also demanded the payment of the annual stipend of 80,000 pieces of money, which had been intermitted during the previous three years, and which the Romans were obliged to pay. In addition to this he insisted on a fugitive who had committed adultery with his wife being handed over to him. Thcognis, in regard to this last demand, replied that the Roman Empire was so vast that it would be virtually impossible to track out such a runaway, who might in fact be dead. Bayan contented himself thereupon with exacting a promise from the Romans that they would try and find him, and if they found him, that they would give him up or inform him if they heard of his death (id. 424-5). John of Ephesus says a year after its capture by the Avars Sirmium was burnt to ashes by fire from heaven (op. cit. lib. vi. ch. xxxiii.).\n\nThe Emperor Tiberius died in the year 582, and with his death we lose the guidance of Menander and have to follow up the story in the pages of Theophylactus Simocatta, who wrote the history of his successor Maurice. Theophylactus tells us the Avars were Huns by nation, and that they were the most faithless of all races and led a nomadic life. Two years after they had taken Sirmium, they sent an embassy to Maurice, who had not then mounted the throne. We are told that they had heard of great and wonderful beasts at the Imperial court, and the Khakan asked to be allowed to\nsee a specimen. The Emperor thereupon sent him one of his largest elephants, but directly he had seen it, he ordered it to be sent back. He also asked the Emperor to have a golden bed made for him, and the most famous artizans in the Empire were employed upon it; but when it was taken to him, he refused it with disdain, as unworthy of his acceptance. He also demanded an additional 20,000 gold pieces annually to his stipend, and when the Emperor refused, he at once prepared for war. In all this insolent behaviour we may recognize a not distant relative of the Mongolian chiefs who invaded Hungary in the thirteenth century. He speedily captured Singidunum, which was short of provisions and weakly garrisoned, the citizens being then engaged in their harvesting. The capture notwithstanding cost the lives of many Avars, and Theophylactus calls the victory a Cadmean one. The Khakan now proceeded to capture some other towns south of the Danube, inter alia, Augusta and Viminacium, two towns of Illyrium, situated on the right bank of the Danube. He then marched upon Ankhialus and devastated its environs. Therm\u00e6, Theophylactus says, was spared on account of the entreaties of Bayan\u2019s concubines, who had gone thither on account of the baths. The waters there were reported to be medicinal. After the campaign had lasted three months, the Romans sent envoys to the Khakan. These were Elpidius, a senator and formerly governor of Sicily, and Comentiolus, who was an officer of the Scribonian Guards. These envoys found the Khakan at Ankhialus. He met their advances in a very haughty manner and threatened that he would destroy the famous long walls which protected the capital. Elpidius remained silent under this infliction, but his colleague, who was of a warmer temperament and had a more glib tongue, spoke out rashly and more befitting a Roman. According to Thcophylactus he said: \u201cO Khakan, the Romans believe that you have some respect for your gods and for the gods of other nations who superintend oaths, and that you will not break promises which you have so solemnly sworn. That you will not forget the benevolence of the Emperors and the\ngood of the people towards you, and the kindly manner in which your ancestors were welcomed, and that you will not permit your subjects to do me the least injury since princes are more moderate than their subjects, and have greater wisdom and dignity. Our desire for peace has made us overlook your outrages and hostilities, and restrained us from attacking you. Instead of meeting you with force, we have been rather content to call your attention to the treaty you made with us; but as you seem untouched by the motives of honour and probity, and that the eye of justice is closed, and Providence, instead of punishing you, has been still while you have made a god of your passion; we shall fall back on our ancient courage, and we will make a terrible slaughter of your people; for much as we love peace, we shall take up arms if they are necessary to repress the insolence of our enemies. What other nation has more bravely fought for country, liberty and glory? If the feeble birds struggle with each other, what will be the ardour of a warlike race such as ours? Do not boast of your treachery. Brave as you are, remember that the Romans command a formidable power, that the vigilance of their princes is great, and that they will draw innumerable reinforcements from the nations subject to them... Having broken your oath, what assurance can you ever give of your truthfulness and probity?... Leave us in peace, and do not abuse your present prosperity to oppress people whose only crime is that of being your neighbours. Remember the way in which you were received when exiles and fugitives, and when you were separated from the main trunk of your monarchy of the East. Do not violate the law of hospitality, so that the world may admire your gentleness. If you want money, the Romans are ready to give it you, since they place more value on glory and liberality than on riches and treasures. For the rest, you are masters of a vast territory, where people live comfortably. Return then to the territory which you hold by the favour of the Romans, and do not allow your troops to cross our frontiers. The most violent winds cannot overthrow a tree whose trunk is solid, whose branches are spread out and charged with leaves, whose roots\nare alive and deeply set, and which is watered by a neighbouring stream or by the rain from heaven. Those who step beyond their due bounds become wise too late, and are punished by the shame which follows such temerity.\"\n\nThis oration was interpreted by the Khakan as an impertinence. He was accordingly furious and ordered Comentiolus to be thrust into prison with his feet manacled, and his tent to be destroyed, a command which was generally interpreted as a sentence of death. The following day, Bayan's anger being still unappeased, his grandees urged him not to violate the sanctity of an ambassador by putting him to death, and urging that the young man's imprudent language had already been sufficiently expiated by his imprisonment. The Khakan assented to this, and agreed to send the envoys back again to the Emperor.\n\nThe next year Elpidius once more returned to Bayan, to negotiate peace, whereupon Targitius, previously mentioned, who was held in high esteem among the Avars, was sent back with him, and a peace was arranged on the onerous terms that the Romans were to pay the Avars an annual subsidy of 20,000 gold pieces, in addition to the 80,000 already paid. Maurice agreed to pay this rather than have on his hands two wars at once, namely, against the Avars and Persians (Theophylactus, op. cit. book 1, ch. v. and vi.).\n\nThe Khakan was outwardly loyal enough to the peace he had made, but this did not prevent his proteges and tributaries, the Slavini, with his secret connivance, making another invasion of the Empire and advancing as far as the Long Walls. The Emperor thereupon sent his guards, headed by Comentiolus, who advanced as far as the Erginas (a river falling into the Propontis, near the Chersonese), where he fell upon them suddenly and inflicted a defeat on them. He then advanced to Adrianople, where he came upon a chief of the Slavini named Andragast, who had with him a rich booty, and many prisoners, and a large division of troops, who was attacked at a fort named Ensinus, and he and his followers were driven out of Astica, i.e. that narrow strip of Thrace between the mountains and the sea, stretching from Constantinople to where Mount\nH\u00e6mus abuts upon the Euxine (i.d. ch. 7; Stritter, ii. 51, 53; Le Bean, op. cit. ix. 246, note 5).\n\nThere was at this time, according to Theophylactus, a certain Scythian (probably a native of Little Scythia, or the Dobruja, see Klaproth, Tableaux, etc. 268) called Bokolabras, which word we are told meant in Greek a Magian priest. Having had an intrigue with one of the Khakan's wives, he persuaded seven Gepid\u00e6, who were subject to him, to accompany him, and determined to escape to the land of his ancestors, who, Theophylactus says, were those Huns living in the East near the Persians who were frequently called Turks. Having crossed the Danube, he went to a place named Libidinum, whose site is unknown. However, he was captured by the Roman guards, to whom he told his story, and who sent him on to the Emperor. He seems to have informed the Roman authorities that the attack of the Slavini had been instigated by the Khakan. The latter's envoy, Targitius, was then at Constantinople, whither he had gone to receive the annual stipend due to his master. Annoyed at Bayan's treachery, the Emperor ordered the envoy to be arrested, and threatened to put him to death, but contented himself with sending him to the island of Khalkitis, one of the isles of the Princes, a little south of Constantinople, where he was detained for six months (Theophylactus, book 1, ch. 8; Stritter, i. 689).\n\nThis was furiously revenged by Bayan, who marched his men into M\u0153sia and the Lesser Scythia, i.e. the Dobruja, and many towns were captured by him. Theophylactus thus names them: Ratiaria, Bononia, Acys, Dorostylus, Saldapa, Pannasa, Marcianopolis, and Trop\u00e6um (op. cit. viii.). Commentiolus was again sent against the invaders, but he could only command the services of the raw militia levies from Thrace and Illyria. He went to Ankhialus, having sent 4000 of his poorest troops to garrison the camp with the baggage. He had 6000 men left, whom he divided into three bodies, of which he entrusted one to Martinus, another to Castus, and reserved the third for himself. He did this no doubt to meet the peculiar tactics of the Avars who used to\noverrun the country in various detachments. Castus set out for Zaldafa or Saldapa, a town (whose site is not known), and Mount H\u00e6mus. He surprised and defeated a body of the invaders. He captured a large booty, but entrusted it to one of his officers, who speedily lost it again in a second encounter. Martinus, having learnt through his spies that the Khakan was at Nea or Noves, i.e. New Town, on the Danube, marched thither to try and surprise him. Having planted an ambush, he did surprise him, and the Khakan only escaped by flying for refuge to a small island in a lake. There he secreted himself, and Martinus failed to find him, although for five days he and his men were separated from the main body of the Avars, and were contemplating surrender. A strict soldier, the Roman commander returned to the rendezvous which had been fixed for the meeting-place of the three armies. There he met Castus. But Comentiolus, who had undertaken to plant himself where he might cut off the retreat of the Avars and then join them, did not move to the assistance of his lieutenants, but allowed himself to be persuaded by one of his centurions, called Rustibius, and remained at Marcianopolis. There he was joined by his two subordinates, and the three returned together to the camp whence they had originally marched, and posted themselves in a beautiful valley in Mount H\u00e6mus. The Avar Khakan, having again brought his people together, prepared to cross the Panysus to enter Thrace. Comentiolus sent Martinus to the wooden bridge by which the river might be crossed, merely to watch the enemy's movements, and Castus was ordered to follow. Martinus carried out his instructions, and having learnt of the enemy's advance, retired to join Comentiolus. Castus, determined to distinguish himself, crossed the bridge, and hiding himself, allowed their advance guard to move on, and when it had passed, fell on the enemy and killed many of them. Overtaken by night before he could recross, he found in the morning that the Avars had seized the bridge, while the river was too deep and rapid to be forded, and seeing himself thus caught in a trap, he fled, and his men dispersed in the\nforests and were sharply pursued and forced by torments to disclose the hiding-places of their comrades. Castus himself, who we are told, hid away like a vine branch among the leaves, was at length captured and put in chains, while nearly all his men were captured. The Avars now overran Thrace, a body of 500 brave men who tried to stop them in a defile were all cut off. Ausimuth, the commander of the Thracian infantry, marched it to garrison the Long Walls, and thus to protect that suburb of Constantinople; but as he took his post behind his men, he was captured by the enemy's scouts. Meanwhile Comentiolus had remained buried in the forests of the Haemus, while the enemy was overrunning the country. At length he called together his various commanders and harangued them, bidding them face their dangers firmly. Thereupon a Tribune rose, and made a speech, in which he urged that the prudent course for them was to retire. They had but 4000 fighting men with them and were burdened by the charge of 4000 unfit to fight. Their recent misfortunes had dispirited them, while the Emperor failed to send them succour. An old man now rose and demanded the right to reply to the Tribune; the soldiers assented. He delivered a stirring address, which is reported by Theophylactus. He bade them act like Romans and not be discouraged by one small defeat, and that the Khakan had only a few days before been himself a fugitive. It was not by following such pusillanimous counsel as that given by the Tribune that the Romans had conquered the world, and he pressed them, in stirring language, to attack the foe, offering himself to show them an example. This speech greatly excited the soldiery, who were collected in the theatre. It was determined to leave their retreat and to advance upon Calbomuntis and Libidurgus. At this time the army of the Avars was scattered throughout Thrace, and Bayan in fancied security was living in his tent but four miles away from the place whither the Roman army was now approaching. Comentiolus arranged the plan by which they were to surprise the Khakan. They at length arrived at a spot where they had to march in single file, when an\naccident entirely disconcerted their plans. A mule having fallen down, some one shouted to the muleteer to return and the words \"torna, torna fratre,\" or, as Theophylactus has it, \"retorna,\" were passed on from man to man, and were misunderstood for a signal to retire. The column turned round and began to retire hastily and confusedly. Meanwhile Bayan, having heard of the imminent danger he had been in, also hastily withdrew (Theophylactus, ii. ch. x.-xv.). The Romans eventually recovered somewhat, and succeeded in killing a number of the enemy. The words used by the soldiers on this occasion show that Vlakh or Rouman was at this time the prevailing language of Thrace and Illyria, whence the troops of Comentiolus were derived.\n\nThe Khakan having returned to the Danube proceeded to try and retrieve his position by laying siege to Apiaria, a strong fortress on that river. A citizen of the place named Busas, who had served well in the Imperial armies, and had retired to his native town, ventured to go out hunting while the enemy was at hand and was captured by them. When they were about to kill him, he offered them a rich ransom if they would spare him. They took him to the foot of the walls, and sent word to the citizens that if they would not redeem him for a considerable sum, he should be put to death before their eyes. Busas uplifted his hands and implored them not to allow a warrior who had done such honour to his country to perish thus. He cited the battles he had fought in and exposed the scars which he bore, and begged them to take his goods, and if this did not suffice, to supplement them in order to save him. The people would have consented, but a young man, who was carrying on an intrigue with Busas' wife, dissuaded them. Busas was now possessed with but one feeling, namely, that of revenge on his fellow-citizens. He promised to get the town into the hands of the Avars if they would spare his life, and taught them how to construct one of the battering engines called Helepolis, and presently Apiaria was captured and sacked. Several other places followed the same fate. Beroen offered a stout resistance, and Bayan, having failed to capture it after repeated efforts,\nwas constrained to retire on receiving a sum of money. He also tried in vain to capture Diocletianopolis, Philippopolis, and Adrianople, whose citizens bravely defended their walls. The Emperor Maurice now began to suffer vicariously for the disasters of his troops, and became the object of lampoons and satires, the dangerous weapons of a discontented mob. He thereupon redeemed Castus, whose capture we have described. He summoned John Mystacones (i.e. the moustachioed), the commander in the Persian war, to the rescue, and gave him as a lieutenant a Lombard or Suevian called Drocto, or Droc-tulf. The latter compelled the invaders to withdraw from Adrianople, and afterwards inflicted a severe defeat upon them by adopting the Eastern tactics of a feigned retreat and then a rally (Theophylactus, ii. xvi.-xvii.; Stritter, i. 689-703; Lebeau, ix. 246-254).\n\nThis defeat was a serious one, and the Avar Khakan for several years was constrained to keep himself north of the Danube. He also abandoned Singidunum and the other Danubian fortresses which he had captured, and which were reoccupied by the Romans (Lebeau, ix. 254). This did not prevent the Slavini, his clients, who are given the alternative name of Get\u00e6 by Theophylactus, from devastating Thrace the following year, i.e. in 587 (op. cit. iii. 4).\n\nAt this time the Lombards and the Romans were engaged in a severe struggle in Italy. The Avars naturally looked upon the former as common friends against a common foe, and we read how, about the year 591, \"Cacanus, the king of Huns,\" i.e. Bayan, sent envoys to Milan to make peace with Agilulf, the Lombard king, who sent him some men skilled in building ships, and with the ships thus made he captured an island off Thrace and even caused alarm at Constantinople (Paulus Diaconus, iv. ch. 12 and 20). Fresh envoys passed between the Avar and Lombard rulers, and a perpetual peace was agreed upon. The Khakan also sent to order the Franks to make a similar peace with the Lombards that they had made with themselves. At this time we also read of the Lombards making an alliance with a body of Avars and Slaves, invading and ravaging Istria (iid. ch. 24).\nIn the same year Maurice made peace with the Persians, and had his hands free to attack the Avars, and he transferred his seasoned soldiers accordingly to Thrace, and determined himself to march at their head, as became his reputation as a soldier; and did so, in spite of many omens, which his people deemed most unpropitious, an eclipse of the sun, an abnormal tide, etc., etc. He left some money to restore the church of Glyceria, which had been desolated by the Avars (id. vi. 1). Four days after reaching Herakleia, he encountered three strangers of gigantic size, wearing neither swords nor any other weapons, and carrying only harps (citharas). They were arrested by the Imperial troops in Thrace. On being taken before the Emperor, and questioned about their origin, and why they had visited the Roman world, they replied that they were Slavi who dwelt on the Western Ocean, and that the Avar Khakan had sent envoys to their princes with many gifts asking for succour. The princes accepted the gifts, but refused the aid asked for, on account of the long distance and bad roads which separated them. They said they had been sent by them to the Khakan with this answer. They had been fifteen months on the way. The Khakan, contrary to the law of nations which protects envoys, had forbidden their return. Having heard of the power and humanity of the Romans, they had seized the opportunity and crossed over into Thrace. They carried harps, since they did not know the use of arms, for their country produced no iron, whence, save tumults and seditions, they lived peaceably together. Ignorant of war, they were devoted to music. The Emperor was delighted with the visitors, their strength of limb, etc., and sent them to Heracleia (id. vi. 2). This Arcadian anecdote of Theophylactus is doubtless largely coloured by his facile pen, but it would be interesting to know whence these three sealds or bards, for such they doubtless were, came from. If really Slaves, they probably came from the Eastern Baltic, but Lebeau suggests that they were really Scandinavians (op. cit. ix. 353-354). The Emperor having superintended the partial concentration of the troops, and while at Ankhialus received envoys at\nthis time from the king of the Franks, offering him an alliance against the Avars on condition of an annual stipend. Maurice gave the envoys presents, but replied that the Franks would find it glorious and useful to ally themselves with the Empire for honour only, and without other mercenary motives (Theophylactus, vi. 3). Theophylactus calls the envoys Bosus (Boson) and Bettus, and tells us their master was called Theodoric, which is a mistake, as it was really Childebert, King of Austrasia, who was then reigning. This is not the only proof he gives of the little knowledge there was at Byzantium at this time about the West, for he calls the Franks \"Celtiberians, now called Phraggoi\" (id.). The Emperor now returned to Constantinople. The Khakan had ordered the Slavini to prepare some boats on which to cross the river, whereupon the people of Singidunum, which was situated near the modern Belgrade, proceeded to attack them and burnt the materials they had accumulated for the purpose. The barbarians, annoyed at this, laid siege to the town, which, after seven days' attack, was on the point of surrendering, when the Khakan summoned them to join him. This they did after obtaining 2000 gold pieces (darics is the word used by Theophylactus), a table plated with gold, and a robe. They proceeded to Sirmium (wrongly called Mirsium by Theophylactus), where the Khakan ordered them to build boats with which to cross the Save. These were formed into a bridge of boats, and the Avars speedily crossed, and in five days reached Bononia (a town of Dacia Ripensis), and continued their journey towards the Euxine. Priscus, the Roman commander, sent Salvian with a thousand horse to defend the defiles of Mount Haemus, where he entrenched himself at a place called Prokliana, and then went on to explore. On seeing the approach of the Avars, he regained his entrenchments. The invaders having tried to force them, a terrible struggle ensued, which cost them dear. A fresh body of Avars now came up to the rescue 8000 strong under a chief named Samur, who again tried to force the pass, but were again defeated. Thereupon the Khakan came up in person, and, overwhelmed by numbers, Salvian withdrew his men at\nnightfall and rejoined Priseus. The Avars did not discover the retreat of the Romans for three days, and having done so, they advanced through the pass, and in three days reached Sabulentus-Canalis, near Ankhialus. At the latter town they burnt the church of St. Alexander the Martyr, and presently caught some Roman spies, to whom they applied torture, but obtained only misleading intelligence from them. They advanced towards the Long Walls, and having reached Drizipera, 68 miles south-east of Adrianople, proceeded to attack it. The inhabitants showed a bold front and kept their gates open, as if preparing for a sortie, and the Khakan, having apparently had some vision in which he saw great bodies of troops coming out of the town in broad daylight and ranging themselves in order outside, retired and withdrew to Perinthus (i.e. Heraclia). Priscus deemed it a good opportunity to attack him, but was beaten in the struggle and withdrew with his infantry to Didymotica (still called Demotica, situated on the Hebrus, south of Adrianople). Thence he went to Zurulla, the modern Churlu. Here he was followed by the enemy, who speedily beleaguered the place. Meanwhile there was naturally great trepidation at the capital, for this was the last fortress before reaching the Long Walls. The Emperor thereupon devised a stratagem. He wrote a letter addressed to Priscus, telling him to hold out a few days longer, when a fleet would set sail for Pannonia, who should ravage the home land of the Avars and carry off their families, and the Khakan would accordingly be obliged to withdraw. This letter was confided to a soldier with orders that he was to allow himself to be captured. The ruse had its expected effect. The Khakan, having had the letter read to him, agreed with Priseus for a peace in consideration of a small sum of money, and returned. Priscus, having distributed his troops in various winter quarters in Thrace, returned to Constantinople (id. vi. 5; Lebeau, ix. 351\u2013359). The Slavini, although tributaries of the Avars, did not deem themselves bound by the treaty of Zurulla, and in the spring of the year following, i.e. 593, Priseus was ordered to the Danube to guard that river.\nHe assembled his men at Heraclia, whence he in four days reached Drizipera, and after halting there fifteen, arrived in twenty days at Dorostola on the Danube, the modern Silistria. While he was there an envoy arrived from Bayan to complain of these preparations. His name as given by Theophylactus was Kokh. He spoke in a truculent fashion: \"What have we here Immortal Gods? Those who claim to be specially devoted to religion; it is they who act thus impiously. The Romans violate peace, the pact is broken, etc. Truly the Danube sees a fine spectacle. He who so ably arranged a peace between the Romans and the Avars is now seen sword in hand. Thou art wicked, O Caesar, in spreading the ills of war thus nefariously. What thou art doing is not worthy of an Imperator, but of a brigand, and is execrable. Either lay aside the crown or do acts worthy of it. Thou it is who teachest the barbarians these crooked ways. We should not have known how to break treaties if thou hadst not taught us, who never entirely refrain from war nor esteem peace. In waging war thou art unjust: in making peace thou makest it uncertain and unstable.\" And thus he continued with a long string of aggressive and menacing phrases. It is no wonder the patience of the Roman soldiery was taxed to its limits, and they would have done the envoy some harm if Priscus had not restrained them and said this kind of insolence was natural to the barbarians. He merely replied that the Slavini were not included in the recent treaty, and that his preparations were made against them alone. Having prepared some boats he crossed the river, and having learnt that the chief of the Slavini, named Ardagast, had marched a portion of his men out and was on a foray, he advanced by night and overtook him. Surprised by this attack, Ardagast mounted while naked on a horse, having neither saddle nor bridle, and fled with no other weapon than his sword. Pursued by a body of men, he had to dismount and face them. Falling over a tree trunk, he would have been undone but for a friendly river, into which he plunged and swam over; but a great number of his people were killed or captured, and the district he ruled\nover was laid waste (id. vi. 6). The Ardagast here named was doubtless the same chief named as attacking Adrianople in 583 (vide supra), and then called Andragast. St. Martin compares the name with Radegast, the name of the Slave God (Lebeau, x. p. 360, note). Priscus determined to send the booty he had captured as a present to the Emperor, a generosity which was resented by the soldiers, who were inclined to be mutinous, until Priscus appeased them by bidding them value the call of honour rather than that of greed. He despatched an officer named Tatimer, whose name is Turkish, with 300 men to escort the booty. Six days after setting out Tatimer was attacked by a body of Slaves suddenly, while his people were unprepared. He rushed to meet them almost single-handed, and laid several of them low, but would have been overwhelmed if a number of his men had not come to the rescue, when he speedily defeated the enemy and made fifty of them prisoners. When he reached Constantinople, he was received with acclamations by the crowd, while the Emperor returned thanks at St. Sophia. Priscus now learnt from his spies that the enemy had retired, and he sent Alexander across a river called Helibacius by Theophylactus, and of which we merely know that it was north of the Danube. He encountered a body of Slaves, who fled to the neighbouring marshes and woods, where they were pursued by the Romans, who in vain tried to burn the woods, as the damp put out the fires, and they were only extricated from their perilous position by a lucky accident. Alexander would have abandoned the enterprize, when a G\u00e6pes (i.e. one of the tribe Gepidae), who had formerly been a Christian, and who, we are told, had taken refuge among the Romans, offered to show him a way through the wood. The Slaves were now surrounded and captured. He tortured them in vain to force from them some intelligence, but they despised pain and death. He was therefore obliged to trust to the Gepid who had already befriended him. He replied that these Slaves were the subjects of one Musoc, to whom they gave the style of king; that he lived thirty parasangs distant; that he had sent these\npeople to explore on hearing of the defeat of Ardagast, and that if Priscus marched against him rapidly he would surprise him. Alexander now rejoined the latter, who put the Slave prisoners he had with him to the sword, and promised to reward the Gepid if he would secure Musoc's person. To reach him it was necessary to cross another river, which the natives called Paspirion, and which Jiresek identifies with the Buzco. He went to Musoc and told him how the defeated followers of Ardagast were hastening to find refuge on his territory, and asking him to supply some vessels in which they might cross the river. He accordingly ordered 150 boats with their rowers to be taken over to receive these fugitives. The Gepid then returned to tell Priscus of his ruse, and Alexander was sent on with 200 men to seize the boats, while Priscus followed with 3000 more. The Romans, on arriving at the river, found the rowers already mentioned asleep or drunk, and while lulled to sleep by Avarian songs, they were attacked and killed and the boats seized. Priscus was now informed and speedily crossed the river with his 3000 men. He marched on and surprised the king while under the influence of the drink he had taken at his brother's funeral feast, and thus Musoc was captured, and the rest of the night was spent in slaughtering the barbarians. Jiresek, speaking of the suffix *uk* or *oc* in Musoc, says that it prevails largely in names in the Bukovina and Gallicia, as in the names Tomashek, Droujuk, etc. (*op. cit.* 89, note 25). The next day the Romans recrossed the river, and in turn gave themselves up to drinking and festivity, and in fancied security dispensed with the usual guards, when the Slaves, having rallied and pursued them, killed a great number of them, and would have annihilated them if they had not been dispersed by Genzon, whose name points to his having been of Vandal origin. Priscus duly hanged the officers who ought to have been on guard, while many of the soldiers were flogged (Theophylactus, vi. c. 6\u20139; Lebeau, x. 360\u2013365).\n\nThe Emperor now sent Tatimer to order Priscus to put his men in winter quarters beyond the Danube. This led to another outbreak of discontent among the troops, who com-\nplained of having to pass the winter in such a rigorous climate, where they were surrounded by barbarous enemies who would destroy those spared by the weather. Their murmurs were again pacified by the influence of Priscus, whose many victories had given him great authority among them (Theophylactus, vi. 10). This planting of the winter quarters of the Romans north of the Danube seems to show that at this date there were as yet no permanent settlements of the Slaves south of the river. Presently Priscus, having learnt that the enemy were preparing to attack him, recrossed the river into safer quarters. Three days later he heard that the Khakan of the Avars, resenting the slaughter of the Slaves, his tributaries, was determined to attack him, and had already issued orders for the Slaves to cross the river. But the Romans had good friends in the Avarian camp, including Targitius, who had several times visited them as an envoy, as we have seen, and they tried to dissuade the Khakan from his intention. Priscus also sent an eloquent doctor, glib of tongue, called Theodorus, whom we have previously met with in connection with the attack on Sirmium, to mitigate the pride and ambition of Bayan. This orator, according to Theophylactus, spoke to his host of the pride and power of Sesostris, and used the occasion further to paint the moral of the vanity of conquests and the false glory of conquerors, a theme which is well suited for the display of the rhetorical rhodomontade of Theophylactus. Sesostris, he makes him say, having in his pride yoked some captive kings to his chariot with bits in their mouths and saddles on their backs, noticed that one of them frequently turned his head round, as if observing one of the wheels. \"What are you looking at?\" said Sesostris. \"I was noticing,\" said the captive king, \"how the top of the wheel sinks to the bottom while the bottom rises to the top.\" Thenceforward Sesostris became more modest, and recognized the inconstancy and fickleness of fortune. The Khakan was apparently impressed by this and professed to be well disposed towards Priscus, and was willing to agree to peace if the latter would cede to him half the booty he had captured,\nwhich he seems to have deemed himself entitled to because the Slaves were his tributaries, or perhaps rather his peculiar and special victims, and therefore the Romans had been poaching within his preserves (id. vi. 11; Thierry, ii. 33-37).\n\nThis proposal was resented by the soldiery, but Priseus pacified them by offering to return the captives to Bayan and retaining the booty for themselves. To this the Avar chief consented: 5000 prisoners were accordingly sent back, and the Romans were allowed to traverse the Avar dominions. Peace being thus restored, they returned to Drizipera for the winter, and Priseus himself went to Constantinople. When he arrived the Emperor reproved him for having returned the prisoners. He also deprived him of his command, which he made over to his own brother Peter, to whom he gave instructions about a new equipment and mode of payment of the troops and about their disposition. Peter fixed his quarters at Odesus, near the modern Varna (Theophylactus, vii. 1).\n\nAbout the year 595 we read how the Bavarians, having attacked the Slavi with an army of 2000 men, the Khakan (i.e. the Khakan of the Avars) went to the rescue and the invaders were all destroyed (Paul Diae. lib. iv. eh. 10). The next year the Avars made an invasion of Thuringia from Pannonia, and pressed the Franks very hard. Thereupon Brunhilda and her nephews, Theudebert and Theuderic, paid them a sum of money and they withdrew again (id. 11).\n\nHaving read the Emperor\u2019s Edicts to the soldiers, the new commander, Peter, pacified their suspicions and in 596 he advanced to Mareianopolis also called Maerianopolis, twenty-four miles north-west of Odessus, and doubtless on the site of the modern Bulgarian town of Pereislavl. He sent an advance guard of a thousand men ahead under Alexander. This body encountered a troop of six hundred Slavini escorting some booty, the spoils of towns which they had pillaged, namely, Zaldapa, Aeys and Scupis. The Slavini, in despair of resisting, put some of their prisoners to death. Then making a rampart of their waggons, they put the women and children inside, and prepared to defend themselves. The Romans were afraid to attack them, when\nAlexander addressed them an harangue in their own tongue (i.e. in the debased Latin then spoken in the Balkan Peninsula). Encouraged by this they broke into the rampart, the Slavini thereupon put their remaining prisoners to death and were themselves killed (Theophylactus, vii. ch. 2, 3). Peter had had his foot lamed, and would have been quiet, but his exacting brother, the Emperor, pressed upon him to further attack the enemy; and we are told that in four marches he reached the place where the Slavini were encamped, which was probably south of the river, perhaps in the Dobruja. Ten days later Maurice wrote again, bidding him not to leave Thrace, as he understood the Slavini meant to advance on Constantinople with all their forces. Peter thereupon seems to have made a perambulation of the towns of Pistes, Zaldapa, Iatrus, Latarcius, Noves, Theodoropolis, Securisca (probably the modern Rustchuk), and Asima, which were no doubt still occupied by Imperial garrisons. At the last of these towns he was so much pleased with the martial character of the soldiers that he wished to join them to his own party. To this the citizens strongly objected, as they would then have been exposed to the enemy. The soldiers themselves did not wish to go, and when he pressed them, they sought refuge in the principal church. Peter ordered the Bishop to have them evicted, and on his refusal had him arrested. The citizens now rose and drove him out. It was three days after entering the town, which was doubtless situated on the Danube near Sistova, that a body of a thousand of his men, who were sent out to explore, encountered 1000 Bulgarians. Counting on the peace which subsisted between the Khakan and the Romans, they were marching harmlessly, when the Romans poured a shower of weapons into them. They halted, entrenched themselves and sent to complain to the commander, who sent them on to Peter. He replied haughtily that he knew nothing of this treaty, and sent back an otherwise uncivil message. The Bulgarians thereupon charged the Romans, and put them to flight, and Peter wreaked his vengeance on the Roman commander, who was beheaded. The Bulgarians reported what had happened to Bayan, who\nsent to complain. Peter pacified him by laying the blame on his subordinate (Theophylactus, vii. 4). This is the first mention we have of the Bulgarians for fifty-seven years, the previous notice of them having been in 539, and the notice makes them subordinate to the Avars. It is an open question whether all this time they were still in the district north of the Danube, or had meanwhile withdrawn beyond the Dnieper and were again returning. It would certainly seem, from the Slavic names borne by the leaders of the Slavini at this time, that the latter, who occupied Wallachia, were governed by their own chiefs, who were only subordinate to the Avar Khakan.\n\nPeter did not desist from his policy against the Slavini. He sent twenty soldiers across the Danube to explore, who were surprised by the enemy. It was the custom for such vedettes to travel by night and rest by day. As they were sleeping and hiding in a covert, they were surprised by the Slavini and put to torture, when in despair they disclosed the plans of the Romans. Piragast, the leader of the Slavini, apparently profiting by this information, put his men in ambush at the point where the Romans intended crossing, and succeeded in killing a thousand of them who crossed over first. On hearing of this, Peter ordered the Romans to go over in a large body, and the flotilla carried over such a number of men that the Slaves could not resist and inter alios their leader, Piragast, was killed. They could not pursue the enemy that night for want of horses, but returned to their intrenchments. The following day they advanced again, but were led astray by their guides, and for three days suffered terribly from want of water, having been led into a district that was very dry. They would have perished had not one of their captives found out that the river Helibacius (vide ante) was only four parasangs distant. To this the soldiers rushed heedlessly, and while quenching their thirst they were decimated by a shower of weapons poured into them by the Slavini, who were hidden in a wood on the other side. The Romans were thus in a trap. They constructed some rafts on which they crossed the river in disorder. They\nwere vigorously opposed and obliged to retire. This defeat cost Peter his command and Priseus was once more reinstated (id. lib. vii. ch. 4 and 5).\n\nAt this time we read that the Emperor Maurice received an embassy from the Khakan of the Turks to inform him of his having put down a rebellion among his people, and we are told that about the same time two tribes named Tarniakh and Kotzagiri, who belonged to the same stock as the Var and Khunni, being driven out by the Turks, migrated and submitted to the Avar Khakan. It is said, adds Theophylactus, that the Zabender, who were also reported to belong to the Var and Khunni, who also joined the Khakan, brought him a reinforcement of 10,000 men. In regard to these tribes, Kotzagiri is probably another form of the name Kutrigur. Tarniakh is apparently a personal name, and that of a chief rather than of a tribe. Zabender may be a variant or corruption of Sabiri. It does not occur elsewhere (id. vii. 8).\n\nPriscus, in the spring of the year 598, traversed Astica, and having recruited some men, made his way to the Danube, which he crossed and arrived at a town called the Upper Nova. This was deemed an intrusion into his country by the Khakan, who claimed the Danube as his frontier, and he sent to inquire the meaning of the invasion. Priscus replied that the district was a good one for hunting and riding and abounding in water. The Khakan objected to the Romans thus invading another's territory, and accused Priseus of thereby breaking the peace. Priscus said the land was Roman soil, that the Avars had come there as fugitives and refugees, and it was not for such to fix the limits of the Empire. The Khakan answered that the Romans had lost the land in fair fighting, and was naturally enraged, and sent a body of troops, which captured Singidunum, destroyed its walls and carried off its people. News of this reached Priseus ten days later; he marched towards it, and when within thirty miles of it, transported his men to an island on the Danube called Surgas, opposite a place called Constantiolus. The Khakan went in person from Singidunum\nopposite to the island and held a colloquy with Priscus, who was on a boat. The Khakan boasted that he had conquered what he held by the sword; he reproached Priscus with breaking the peace and furtively making war while still bound by a treaty, and he invoked Heaven to decide between him and Maurice. On the other hand, Priscus reproached the Khakan with the destruction of Singidunum, and taunted him with his avarice, ambition, and recklessness. Bayan finally threatened that he would destroy many towns and withdrew. Priscus ordered Gundius with a large force to advance upon Singidunum. He approached the town, which was watered by the Save and Drave, in a flotilla of boats. When the enemy saw the Romans approach, the walls of the town having been dismantled, they made a rampart with their waggons, but, attacked by the Romans, and afraid the peasants of the district might assail them from behind, they eventually withdrew. Priscus thereupon proceeded to rebuild the walls. The Khakan was much disturbed at this, renounced the pact he had made with the Romans, and marched with his men towards the Ionian Gulf, that is, the Adriatic. He captured a town in Dalmatia called Banges by Theophylactus, and Balbes by Theophanes, of which we know nothing further. He also laid waste forty other fortresses. Priscus sent Gundius with 2000 men to watch the enemy; the latter to avoid danger kept away from the main road and advanced by side paths and bye ways. Having approached them, he looked down upon them from a lookout on a height and sent thirty men to get a nearer view. They surprised a party of them when asleep, killed some of them, and carried three off as prisoners. They informed Gundius that theirs was a detachment of 2000 in charge of the booty. He accordingly planted his men in ambush, rushed upon them from behind, put them all to death, and secured the plunder they were carrying, with which he returned to Priscus. This loss was greatly felt by the Khakan, who now returned home again (id. vii. 11 and 12).\n\nWhile the Avars were thus laying waste Dalmatia, the Slavini pillaged Istria, which was subject to the Empire,\nand also the Lombard frontier. As they were tributaries of the Khakan (who is called Cacanus Hunnorum by Paul the Deacon), the latter, who was at war with the Empire and afraid of entangling himself with fresh enemies, sent envoys to Agilulf, the Lombard King at Milan, to make amends and to secure peace with him. From him he obtained some men skilled in ship building, with which he secured a fleet, and thus conquered an island of Thrace. After receiving the Avar envoys, Agilulf in turn sent envoys to the Khakan, to arrange a perpetual pact with him. Bayan\u2019s envoys, who went back with them, passed through the land of the Franks and urged the Frank Kings to be at peace with the Lombards as they were with themselves. The Imperial general, Callinicus, in the year 601, captured the city of Parma from the Lombards and in it secured Godeskalk with his wife, Agilulf\u2019s daughter. Determined to avenge this we find that the Lombards, in alliance with the Avars and Slaves, entered Istria and laid it waste with fire and sword (Lebeau, vol. x. pp. 347\u201349, notes).\n\nWe have seen how the Khakan having invaded Dalmatia lost all his booty to the Romans. He only waited till the early spring to take his revenge, and in February, 599, traversed Moesia and appeared before Tomi in the Lesser Scythia, a place famous as that to which the poet Ovid was exiled. Priscus marched to the rescue. Theophanes says he went from Singidunum, and the two armies faced one another for some time without attacking. On the approach of Easter, provisions began to fail in the Roman camp, the country round having been devastated by the Avars. The Khakan now displayed a singular freak of generosity. He sent to tell Priscus that he was ready to furnish them with food. Priscus was taken aback by this unwonted generosity and suspected it; but the two chiefs having sworn mutual good faith, a truce of five days was agreed upon, when a large number of wagons, Theophanes says 400, with provisions were duly sent to the Roman camp. The Khakan had asked for nothing in return; but four days later he sent to ask for some Indian spices. Priscus\nthereupon sent him some pepper, spikenard, eassia, and eastum. During the truce the soldiers of the two armies intermingled, and even lived in the same tents; when it was concluded, they again separated. Six days later news reached Bayan that Comentiolus was marching towards Nikopolis, having been sent by the Emperor with a relieving army. The Khakan at once set out to meet him. Priseus did not pursue, as he had not heard of his colleague's march, and thought the retreat a ruse of the Avars. Comentiolus hearing of the Khakan's march halted at Zicidiba, thence he went to Yatrus, which was situated on the Danube west of Nikopolis. The Avars being only twenty parasangs distant, he sent a secret letter to the Khakan. He then ordered his men under arms some time before daybreak; but the order was given so carelessly, that many of the soldiers, fancying it was merely a review, did not even put on their cuirasses. When the sun rose, to their surprise they found themselves in front of a well-appointed army but two miles off. They seized such arms as they could, and confusedly formed up their ranks; but Comentiolus increased their confusion by transferring troops from one wing to another, and he even secretly counselled the men in the right wing to escape with their baggage. They still held their ranks, and at nightfall sought their camp. Comentiolus thereupon chose out some picked soldiers, and, under pretence of sending them out to explore, counselled them to make their escape. He himself also fled under pretence of hunting. At noon, conscious of his treachery, the rest of the army withdrew across the Yatrus, and fled precipitately. As they neared the gorges in the mountains near Nikopolis, they found them occupied by a body of Avars, but joining their ranks they forced their way through with great loss.\n\nComentiolus, on reaching Drizipera, found the gates closed, and the citizens reproached and cast stones at him, whereupon he continued his flight to the capital, where he entered into the wretched intrigues that had full course there. Meanwhile the Avars approached Drizipera, captured the town and burnt the church of St. Alexander, destroyed his\nsilver-decorated tomb, and dispersed his bones. A pestilence broke out in the Avar army, which was attributed to this sacrilege, and through which, we are told, no fewer than seven of Bayan's sons perished. This pestilence is described as a kind of fever with bubos (i.e. boils?).\n\nThe flight of Comentiolus filled the capital with alarm, and it was seriously debated to abandon it and escape to Chalcedon. The Emperor sent the garrison, his own guards, and the greater part of the citizens to man the Long Walls. The Senate urged him to send envoys to the Khakan. To this he acceded, and despatched Harmaton with many presents to Drizipera, where he found the Khakan in the greatest distress at the loss of his sons and the death of his men. For twelve days the envoys waited for an audience, and it was some time before he would accept the Imperial presents. He called upon God to judge between him and Maurice, between the Avars and the Romans, and accused the latter of breaking the treaty, in which he was assuredly not very far wrong, and of having caused the recent disasters.\n\nTheophylactus candidly traces the war and its consequences to the treachery of the Romans. A fresh treaty was entered into, by which the Danube was accepted as the boundary between the two nations, power being reserved to the Romans, however, to cross it in order to attack the Slavini. In addition to this 20,000 gold pieces were to be added to the annual tribute to be paid the Avars. This is the account given by the contemporary writer Theophylactus. Theophanes, Anastasius, Cedrenus, Zonaras, the Pascal Chronicle, and Constantine Manasses agree in a further statement, namely, that the Khakan demanded the ransom of a gold piece per head for each of the 12,000 captives he had made. Maurice, demurring to pay this, he reduced the amount to one-half, and even to four siliquas per head. The avaricious Emperor still refusing, the Khakan was greatly disgusted, and put his prisoners to death. These authors also say the tribute was augmented by 50,000 gold pieces. It is almost incredible the Emperor should have been so mean and wicked, but the concurrence of testimony is certainly curious, if it is not to\nbe discounted as an after invention to excuse the murder of Maurice by Phocas (Theophylactus, vii. 13\u201315; Stritter, vol. i. pp. 724\u2013732, Lebeau, vol. x. pp. 380\u2013386). Lebeau suggests that the mutinous conduct of the soldiers on more than one occasion may have incited the Emperor's revenge, and the way in which Comentiolus was received at Constantinople after his dastardly conduct certainly points to some ignoble policy at headquarters.\n\nThese events caused great discontent in all directions. The army commanded by Priscus sympathized with the fate of the troops under Comentiolus, the discontent extended to the populace of Constantinople, and Phocas, who afterwards succeeded him, insulted Maurice to his face before the Senate. It was apparently to relieve himself from this humiliating position that the Emperor was anxious to break the peace he had made. In the summer of 601 Comentiolus was ordered to march with a fresh army towards the Danube and to join his troops to those of Priscus, who had passed the winter at Singidunum. Thence they passed to Viminacium, an island on the Danube, where Comentiolus appeared to be ill. The Khakan, on hearing of this, sent four of his sons with some troops to prevent the Romans from crossing, but they made some rafts, crossed over, and defeated them. Priscus had remained behind at Viminacium, awaiting the convalescence of his colleague, who was apparently more afraid than really ill, not wishing to risk a battle in the absence of Priscus, who had the confidence of the Court; but the troops who had crossed the river and entrenched themselves, sent him word that the enemy, emboldened by his absence, were assailing their camp; he accordingly joined them, and then sent back the rafts and rude boats, by which they kept up a communication with Viminacium, so that they could not withdraw. The enemy were eager for the fight, and he accordingly drew out his men in front of the camp, and to circumvent the tactics of the Avars, who were accustomed to rush in sections from various sides, he ranged them in three bodies in the form of squares. After a struggle lasting till nightfall, the Romans were victorious,\nwith a loss of only 300 men, while the enemy lost 4000 (Theophylactus, viii. chh. i. and ii.). During the next two days the enemy was quiet, but having appeared again on the third day, he this time ranged his men in the shape of three half moons, so as to enclose them. On this occasion they lost 9000 men. The victorious Romans once more returned to their camp. On the tenth day the Avars again recovered themselves, when Priscus, encouraged by his previous victories, advanced himself to assail them. As before he marched in three divisions, but the enemy remained in one body. Planting himself on a height, he spread out his two wings and rushed upon them, driving them before him into a marsh or lake which lay there. 15,000 Avars perished in this struggle, among whom were four of the Khakan\u2019s sons. The Khakan himself deemed it prudent to escape to the Theiss. On the thirtieth day Priscus followed up this victory by another on the Theiss. He then sent 4000 men across that river. This body fell upon three towns, where some Gepidae, unaware of the struggle of the previous day, were engaged in festivities and drinking. The Romans surprised them in this state, killed 30,000 of them, and carried off an immense booty. Twenty days later the Avars collected a large body of their troops on the Theiss, and Priscus again engaged them, and inflicted another serious defeat, in which 3000 Avars, 8000 Slavini, and 6200 other barbarians were captured and sent to Tomi. This succession of victories is a wonderful proof of the skill of Priscus, who assuredly revived in his person the ancient military renown of the Romans. The Khakan now gave a similar proof of his astuteness, for he at once despatched some messengers with orders to reach Constantinople before the tidings of the victory arrived there, and to threaten the Emperor that if he did not return the prisoners, he would lay waste Thrace and Moesia with fire and sword. Maurice, who was much depressed by the discontent of his subjects and other causes, and unaware of the real state of things, allowed himself to be intimidated, and ordered the prisoners to be liberated, much to the chagrin of\nPriscus and his men (Theophylactus, book viii. chapters 3 and 4).\n\nThese victories of Priscus aroused the jealousy of Comentiolus, who was also fired to do something heroic. He went to Noves, where he assembled the principal inhabitants, and asked them to furnish guides for the land beyond the Danube, along the famous road which Trajan made across Dacia, by which, as St.-Martin says, the road leading to Ulpia Trajana, the ancient Zarungithusa, is doubtless meant. Comentiolus boasted that he wished to lay in ashes all this wide territory, which belonged to the Khakan of the Avars. As they could find him no guides, he in a rage put two of them to death. They were much troubled at this, and protested that no one at Noves knew this road, but that four leagues away there was an old man 112 years old who was well informed in the archaeology of the district, and who would duly instruct him. Comentiolus sent for him, and pressed him to become their guide. He declined, and declared the route to be impracticable; that broken down in a great number of places, this road traversed rugged mountains, deep valleys, and wide marshes; that it had been abandoned for more than ninety years, and that the year was so far advanced that the country would be found covered with snow and ice. Comentiolus was obstinate, and the result was that a large number of his men, together with nearly all his sumpter cattle, died from the exposure and privations they were exposed to. He was obliged to return to Philippopolis, where the army passed the winter (id. 4; Lebeau, vol. x. pp. 393, 394).\n\nThe successes of Priscus apparently drew upon him the jealousy of his master, who once more appointed his own brother Peter in his place. This was in the year 602. He encamped his army at Palastolus on the Danube, where he passed the favourable season for operations in inactivity. In September he withdrew to Dardania, the mountain district between Macedonia and Upper Moesia, probably to pass the winter in more genial quarters. There he learnt that an Avar general, named Apsikh, had assembled a large force at a\nplace called Kataractes (by which, perhaps, some place near the Iron Gates of the Danube is meant). A colloquy followed, in which Apsikh wished to secure the surrender of Kataractes by the Romans. As this could not be, each party withdrew. Thereupon the Khakan went to Constantiola, an unknown place on the Danube, while the Romans retired to Thrace.\n\nThe next summer the Emperor, having learnt that the Khakan intended to take advantage of the scattered character and imprudent arrangements of the Roman armies to march suddenly upon the capital, determined to forestall him, and ordered the Romans to march from Adrianople and cross the Danube. Peter thereupon told Bonosus to prepare some pinnaces with which to cross the river, and entrusted the expedition to Gundius. The latter crossed the river, committed a great slaughter there, and secured much booty, but delayed recrossing, which the soldiers were anxious to do. Thereupon the Khakan sent Apsikh to destroy the Arti, who were allies of the Romans. Theophanes says to destroy the boatmen who assisted the latter, but \\textit{vau\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd} is perhaps a corruption of \\textit{Av\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd}, as has been suggested, and this would identify the Arti with the Antae, a very probable conclusion. However this be, it seems that their punishment was followed by a considerable desertion on the part of the Avars, which greatly distressed the Khakan, and he used strong measures to bring them back. Meanwhile the Emperor ordered Peter to winter beyond the Danube, an order which was very ungrateful to the soldiery, there being little further hope of plunder, while their horses were few in number, and the enemy was powerful. A revolt broke out, which Peter could not quell, and he indignantly left them and went some ten miles away. They accordingly moved their camp, and traversed a fortified place called Asema to go to Carisca, whence they had set out to attack the Slavini. Here they stayed awhile, preparing boats with which to recross.\n\nThe soldiers in vain urged Peter to let them winter among their families. The Emperor was equally urgent that they\nshould winter north of the Danube, and by living on the people there save the treasury from being invaded. Peter summoned Gundius to a conference, and put before him in lachrymose language his embarrassments between the Emperor's orders and the determination of the soldiery, and denounced the avarice of Maurice (Theophylactus, bk. viii. ch. 6). The difficulty was speedily solved for him, however, for the soldiers put Phocas at their head, and marched upon Constantinople, where he was speedily crowned, and Maurice with his five sons were executed. This was on the 27th of November, 602. The usurpation of Phocas was followed by an attack on the empire, both on the east and west, by the Persians on the one hand and the Avars on the other. But two years later the Khakan was induced to make peace by an increased annual stipend (Theophanes, p. 451).\n\nWith the death of Maurice we lose the guidance of his graphic and interesting biographer, Theophylactus. There is a work extant, the \"Tactics of the Emperor Maurice,\" which has only once been printed as an appendix to a seventeenth century edition of Aelian, which was published at Stockholm. In this work there are several references to the Avars, but they are so general and wanting in detail, that I have not found it possible to utilize them. Let us now revert to our narrative.\n\nWe do not read again of Bayan, and it would appear that he died about this time, perhaps from the pestilence already named. It is not impossible that it was that pestilence, and the loss of their great leader, which made it possible for Priscus to win his victories so easily. It was the same fact which doubtless led to the desertion of so many of the Avars, as mentioned by Theophylactus. The Avars never again recovered the vast power which they exercised under Bayan, who must be classed among the most successful of generals and the most powerful of rulers.\n\nWe have seen how peace was made between Phocas and the Avars in the year 604. This peace was no doubt a great gain to the Avars, who would probably have been driven out of Europe if the campaigns of Priscus had been followed up.\nThe year before, we are told, the Avar Khakan sent some Slavini to help Agilulf, the Lombard king, with whose aid he conquered Cremona (Paul Diac. l. iv. ch. 28).\n\nLebeau mentions an attack made by the Avars upon Thrace and Illyria in the year 608, which is not mentioned by Theophanes, and I do not know on what authority he speaks.\n\nIn the year 610 we are told that the Khakan of the Avars went with an innumerable multitude, and invaded the borders of Venetia, i.e. of Friauli. Gisulf, Duke of Friauli, tried to oppose them, but being overwhelmed by numbers, was killed with nearly all his people. Those who escaped, including Gisulf's widow Romulda, took shelter in the seven fortresses of Friauli. The Avars proceeded to lay waste the country with fire and sword, and laid siege to the capital of Friauli, Forum-Julii. Here Romulda had taken refuge, and about it the Khakan marched his cavalry, to see where it was most weak. He was seen by the Lombard princess, who was anything but chaste, and noticing that the Khakan was a young man, she sent him word that if he would marry her she would surrender the place with all that was in it. He agreed. She opened one of the gates, through which the Avars rushed, and proceeded to devastate the city, which they set fire to, making captive all whom they found, promising to settle them in Pannonia. When, however, they had taken them out into the open space called Sacrum, they, after the fashion of Chinghiz Khan in later days, put all the grown-up Lombards to death, and divided the women and children among them by lot. But Cacco and Raduald, sons of Gisulf and Romulda, took to horse and escaped. They took a third brother, Grimoald, who was a mere boy, with them. One of them, fancying that he could not cling to his horse, and that it was better he should die than be carried off into slavery, was about to pierce him with his lance, when the boy bade him not to touch him, as he was sure he could cling on. He accordingly took him in his arms, and placed him on the bare back of the horse. The boy seized the horse's mane, and they galloped off together. The Avars pursued them,\nbut only overtook Grimoald, who was captured. They would not kill him, but reserved him for slavery. The chronicler describes him as a beautiful boy, with flaxen hair and sparkling eyes. The boy drew his sword, struck the Avar on the head with it and dismounted him, and presently joined his brothers. The wretched Rounlda, who was the cause of all the misfortune, had a dreadful fate. The Khakan, having satisfied his desires, passed her on to twelve of his companions, and after having been debauched by each in turn, she was impaled. Her daughters, to avoid a similar fate, according to the chronicler Paul, put some chicken's flesh upon their breasts, which became offensive with the heat, and the Avars, who fancied the odour was natural, refused to have anything to do with them. One of them afterwards married the King of the Alemanni, and the other the Prince of Bavaria (op. cit. iv. 37).\n\nThe war above described, in which the Avars were so effectually defeated, constrained them to keep the peace for many years, and it is not till about the year 619 (Thierry, op. cit. vol. ii. p. 69, dates it in the autumn of 1616) that we read of fresh intercourse between them and the empire. According to some authors this intercourse was initiated by Heraclius, who was contemplating a fresh war against the Persians, and wished to secure his flank from attack, and accordingly sent envoys with presents, suggesting a treaty of peace. Nicephorus says that it was the Khakan who sent to propose this, and that it was in reply to this advance the Emperor sent the patrician Athanasius and the questor Cosmas with presents. St.-Martin, judging from the general narrative of Nicephorus and Theophanes, when compared with those of Cedrenus and Zonaras, suggests that the Avars had at this time made an invasion of Thrace. He supports this view by the fact, which is remarkable, that Heracleia, which is situated very near Constantinople, was selected as the place of meeting (Lebeau, vol. xi. p. 22).\n\nThe Khakan told the envoys that the peace which had lasted so long proved his amicable feelings towards the Romans, and he suggested a meeting between himself and\nthe Emperor. The latter, wishing to give his guest a lordly welcome, went to Heracleia accompanied by a large concourse of people, grandees, clerics, and workmen, and also sent there the furniture of a theatre and of a chariot course, with many rich robes for the Khakan and his grandees. Maurice delayed three days at Selymbria, where a crowd of people had gone out of curiosity. When the Khakan reached Heraclia, he planted his best men in ambush in the woods and valleys near the Great Wall, with orders to waylay the Emperor. They were noticed by some peasants, who gave information of what had happened. Heraclius thereupon put aside his diadem, which he slung over his arm, and his royal robes, adopted the costume of a peasant, and fled in all haste with his escort to Constantinople. The Avars pursued him sharply, and trod under the feet of their horses the men, women, and children; and we read that they slaughtered a large number of Romans. They covered the country from the Hebdomus to the bridge of Barcinissus, (i.e. of the stream now called the Sweet Waters) with their men. They ravaged the whole district, burning the houses, pillaging the churches, breaking the statues and altars. Inter alia the chapel of St. Cosmas and St. Damian, at Blakhernes, was sacked, while that of the Archangel at Promotus was entered, the holy table broken, and the eiboria carried off. The imperial baggage, the presents, the theatre, and the chariots were captured, and according to Nicephorus they carried off 290,000 prisoners. Theophanes says many Thracian towns were also sacked (Nicephorus, History of Heraclius, ch. iv.; Theophanes, Cedrenus).\n\nHeraclius, having to make headway against the Persians, determined at all hazards to make peace with the Avars. He accordingly sent fresh envoys to the Khakan, who professed to apologize for what had occurred, and promised to restore what he had captured. By the treaty which was made, Heraclius agreed to pay the barbarians 200,000 pieces of gold, and also sent his natural son John, also called Atalaric, his nephew Stephen, son of his sister Maria Eutropius, and John, natural son of the Patrician Bonus as hostages.\nA few years later, namely, in the year 626, the Avars and the Romans had another and a final struggle, which is described for us in the anonymous narrative known as the Paschal Chronicle, which at this point, as St.-Martin says, is clearly contemporary and founded on an official report (Lcbeau, vol. ii. p. 129). Shaharbaz, the Persian commander, sent envoys to the Khakan of the Avars to assist in an attack on Constantinople. George Pisides, who wrote a poem on the struggle, tells us how the Slave united himself with the Hun, the Scythian with the Bulgar, the Mede with the Scyth, etc. The Avars supplied some boats (scaphi) hewn out of single trunks (Theophanes, p. 487). The Persian army advanced as far as and was encamped about Chalcedonia. At length, on the 29th of June, there arrived before the great walls the head of the Avar army, comprising 30,000 men. The various Roman troops, whose duty it was to protect the capital, now withdrew within the walls. The next day the Avars advanced within four leagues of the place, and encamped near M\u00e9lanias, and burnt the villages around. Meanwhile, as they seemed to advance no further, a large number of soldiers and citizens marched out a distance of three leagues on a foraging expedition. They were set upon by a body of the enemy, which killed a portion of them and captured others. The Roman soldiers we are told fought bravely on this occasion, and enabled many of the citizens to escape. The same day a body of 1000 Avars turned the Gulf of C\u00e9ras, and advanced beyond the suburb of Syques, and as far as the Church of the Saint Maccabees on the Bosphorus, in order to communicate with the Persians who were encamped on the other side of the water at Chrysopolis, where Scutari is now situated. They exchanged signals. When the Romans heard that an alliance was being negotiated between the Persians and the Avars, they sent Athanasius as their envoy to the latter to try and prevent it. He was detained, and when their army reached Adrianople was summoned by the Khakan, and bidden to go and tell his compatriots that they might buy his retreat if they liked to pay. Athanasius was reproached on his return by Bonus\nand others for having degraded himself by becoming the bearer of such a message. He replied that he had merely fulfilled the mission he had been appointed to, and that he was ready to go back and take a more aggressive message, even at the risk of his life. He accordingly set out, and before doing so saw a review of the Roman troops, which comprised 12,000 horsemen and probably a much larger number of foot-soldiers. Of this he could give a report to the enemy. He was told to tell the Khakan, in conciliatory language, the determination of the Romans to defend themselves to the last rather than submit to any humiliating terms. The Khakan was angry at his message, drove him out, and bade him go back and say that unless there was an unconditional submission, he would entirely destroy the city.\n\nOn the 29th of July the Khakan arrived before the walls, and his troops seemed innumerable. One portion of them, we are told, wore loricated armour. The following day a party of his men advanced to the Church of Our Lady of the Fountain, situated only twenty-five paces from the Golden Gate. They were attacked and cut in pieces by some troops which made a sortie. On the 31st the bombardment began, and from daybreak till six in the evening the walls were assailed along the length from the Gate of Polyandrius to that known as \"the Fifth.\" The attack continued during the next two days. From twelve towers on wheels as high as the walls, covered with hides, was poured in a shower of stones, arrows, and javelins. This was replied to by the machines on the wall and the garrison, which fought desperately, while frequent sorties killed many of the assailants and also destroyed their war engines. The sailors also fought well, and one of them invented a machine consisting of a tower on wheels, from whose summit hung a boat containing armed men. This was pushed along the walls, while the men inside threw torches upon the battering engines. Bonus, while fighting bravely, continually urged the Avars to retire, offering if necessary to increase the accustomed tribute. He only received one answer however, namely, to surrender the city and leave his fortune in their hands. After three days' attack\nthe Khakan demanded a parley. Five of the principal senators were sent out to him. These he confronted with three Persian officers, dressed in silken robes, who had been sent to him by Shaharbaz, and whom he seated beside him while he put the Roman envoys below them. He then said that the Persians had offered them their aid, but he should not accept it, if they would listen to his counsels. He demanded that the citizens should leave the city, taking nothing with them but their clothes, and should withdraw to the Persian camp, where they would be well treated. Shaharbaz had given his word to that effect, and he would guarantee it. This was their sole means of escape, since they were neither birds which could fly through the air, nor fish which could traverse the water. He intended to take the city next day, and would make a desert of it. He also bade them not rely upon their Emperor, who he was assured by the Persians had misled them, and had not invaded their country. One of the senators, irritated by this harangue, replied that the Persian envoys were really deceiving the Khakan with their statements, and were impostors, that a relieving army had already entered Byzantium, and that the Romans were devastating the Persian territory; and when one of them replied in an insulting way, the senator in turn answered that he had nothing to reply, and that he considered their language as an insult offered not by them but by the Khakan himself, and turning to the latter, he said, \"With such an army you still have need of the Persians.\" \"Not at all,\" was the reply, \"they have simply offered me assistance as my friends.\" \"Very well,\" said the Roman, \"accept their offers; as far as we are concerned, we do not mean to abandon our city, and if you have nothing more to say, we had better return.\" They accordingly did so. The next night the three Persians were crossing the Bosphorus in a boat to return to Chrysopolis, when they were captured and carried off to Constantinople. The Romans cut off the head of one, and the hands of the second, and having tied them round the neck of the latter, set him loose to return to the Khakan's camp. The third was taken within sight of Chrysopolis, when his head\nwas also decapitated, and then fired by a catapult into the Persian camp, with a note in these terms, \"The Khakan has made peace with us. He has handed your envoys over to us, and we send you the head of one of them.\"\n\nAs they had no boats in which to cross the Bosphorus, the Persians could not revenge this irony. The Khakan wished to assist them in crossing. He had brought with him a large fleet of boats manned by Slavini with which to blockade the Gulf of C\u00e9ras, while he attacked the city from the land side; but the Roman fleet had frustrated his plans, and forced his small boats to take shelter in the shallow Gulf of Barchyssus, where they could not be pursued by the larger vessels. Presently the Avars transported a portion of their fleet to a bay of the Bosphorus called Chel\u00e6, two leagues distant from Constantinople, where they were concealed from view; but the Romans got notice of their plans, and duly laid in wait for them, and meanwhile, out of bravado, sent the Khakan a present of game and wine. Thereupon an Avar chieftain named Ermitzis approached one of the gates, and cried out: \"You have done a shameful thing in killing two men who yesterday supped with the Khakan, and in sending one back with the head of another.\" The Romans replied that these things mattered little to them. The night following, the Persians were ready to embark, and the Avar boats set out to fetch them, when they were attacked and dispersed by the Roman fleet, and the Slave boatmen who manned them were killed. The Khakan now determined to make a last effort to capture the city. A general bombardment was ordered to commence at daybreak, during which an assault was to be made upon the walls, while the boats at the outflow of the Barchyssus were to discharge their men along another side, and thus form a diversion. Nicephorus tells us that the Slavini were ordered when they noticed the watch fires lighted on the fortress of Blakhern\u00e6 named Ala, to row speedily towards the city and cause such terror there that the Avars from the land side might be able to surprise and escalade the walls. Bonus, the Roman commander, was duly forewarned of this. According to the contemporary\nPaschal Chronicle he sent a body of Armenians, who lighted signal fires on the portico of the Church of St. Nicholas of Blakhern\u00e6. On seeing these fires the Slavini, fancying they had been lighted as a signal for them, made for them, and fell into the hands of the Armenians, who slaughtered most of them. A few reached the Khakan's presence, who, probably from chagrin, ordered them to be put to death. The Romans carried off the Avar boats (Paschal Chronicle, passim). The attack from the land side was equally futile, and the Khakan, who watched the proceedings from an eminence with his cavalry, was beside himself with rage. The garrison made a sortie, and so terror-stricken were the Avars that even women and children, who accompanied the Romans, penetrated to their camp. These disappointments broke the courage of the Khakan, who dismantled his siege machinery, set fire to his moving towers, and overturned his entrenchments. He sent a herald to proclaim to the citizens of Constantinople that he was only retiring to make more complete preparations, and that he should presently return and do to them as they had done to the Persian envoys. He followed this message with an invitation to the Patrician Bonus to give him another interview. The latter replied that he had no longer the power to treat, but that the Emperor's brother was at hand with his victorious army, and would speedily march into the Khakan's own country, and there treat for peace. This was of course not true, but it still more frightened the Khakan, who, afraid that he should have to deal with Theodore, the victor of Sais, at once broke up his camp. His retreat was covered by his cavalry.\n\nA portion of his army remained behind and devastated the environs of the city, including the churches of St. Cosmas and Damian, and that of St. Nicholas (Paschal Chronicle, passim). According to Theophanes they also destroyed the aqueduct which had been built by Valentinian. The famous church of St. Mary was the only one which remained intact in Blakhern\u00e6. No wonder, therefore, that the renowned Panagia should have had much of the glory of the victory assigned to her, and that legends should also have attached\nthemselves to her person. Thus we are told in the Paschal Chronicle that the Khakan of the Avars himself told his people how, during the attack on the city, he had seen a woman in beautiful costume perambulating the walls. Cedrenus, apparently reporting another version of this story, tells us the Avar soldiers saw an illustrious woman, in appearance somewhat like a eunuch, leave the gate of Blakhern\u00e6 at sunrise. The sentinels, thinking it was the sister of Heraclius going out to propose peace on behalf of her brother, opened the gates of the camp, but hardly had she crossed the ditch when she vanished from their sight, whereupon the Avars, as if seized by a frenzy, began to fight each other. The story is a curious replica of similar Greek legends of a much older day about Athene and other goddesses.\n\nIt is, at all events, curious, as Thierry points out, that the church of the Virgin was alone spared while the other churches of Blakhern\u00e6 were sacked (op. cit. p. 101). Nicephorus, a few years later, recalls what was doubtless a result of this war. He tells us that in the year when the Roman general Theodorus was defeated by the Saracens, i.e. in the 25th year of Heraclius, A.D. 634, Maria, the sister of the Emperor, sent money to the Avars to redeem her son Stephen above named from captivity. Thereupon the Avar ruler urged upon Antonianus that he should similarly redeem the other hostages who were in Avarian hands, which was accordingly done. Notwithstanding the ravage they made, and the plunder they carried off, the retreat of the Avars from the capital was treated as a Roman success, and its glories were sung in verse by George the Deacon, surnamed Pisides. It would seem to have largely broken the prestige of the Avars, and it was at all events their last effort against the Empire.\n\nThe power of the Avars at the end of the sixth century has hardly been realized by many students. Their dominion was apparently bounded on the north by the Baltic, and they doubtless ruled over the Maritime Slaves. On the south they were nominally bounded by the Danube, but their many raids across that river, and the apparent hold they had upon portions of Illyria, makes this only a nominal\nboundary. On the west they were limited by the dominions of the Franks and Bavarians, and were masters apparently of Bohemia on the one hand and Carinthia on the other. While on the east their domination extended to the frontier of the Turks, which is uncertain, perhaps as far as the Dnieper. Within this vast area their power was more or less felt, although many of the subject tribes had their own chieftains.\n\nWe now reach a period when this vast dominion broke to pieces. Fredegar tells us how in the 40th year of Clothaire, a certain Samo of the nation of the Franks associated himself with some people of Soignies (Sennonagus pagus), who, like him, were merchants, and went among the Slaves called Winidi, who were on the point of revolting against their terrible taskmasters, the Avars and their Khakan (called Gagan by Fredegar). They were known as Winidi Cefuci, because the Avars put them in front of themselves in fighting, so that they were threatened both before and behind. If they were victorious, the Avars advanced to seize the booty they captured; while if they were beaten, the Avars went to their succour. The Avars passed their winters in the country of the Winidi, they took their wives and daughters to their beds, and made other exactions. The children who were born from the mixed race could no longer brook this treatment, and had begun to rebel, when Samo arrived and joined their forces. He exhibited so much bravery that they elected him as their king, and he ruled them for thirty-five years, during which time he won many victories over the Avars (Fredegar, ch. xlviii.). The Wends here referred to were doubtless the Wends of Bohemia, and this means that the Avars lost their control over the various Slavic tribes to the north of them, including the Bohemians, Slovaks, and the Maritime Slaves east of the Elbe. The revolt of the Wends was followed by a more serious outbreak nearer home.\n\nIn my view the river Theiss was at this time an important frontier. It separated Avaria, the country settled and inhabited by the Avars and their slaves, the Gepidae, from Dacia and its borders, the country of the Hunnugundurs, Hunigurs, or Bulgarians, and their clients the Slavini, who\nwere apparently tributary to the Avars, but had princes of their own.\n\nNicephorus, in his account of Heraclius, tells us that a certain Kubrat, the cousin of Organa, the ruler of the Hunnugundurs, rebelled against the Khakan of the Avars, drove out the people whom he had received from him, and afterwards sent an embassy to make peace with Heraclius, which lasted during their joint lives. Heraclius made him presents, and gave him the title of Patrician (Stritter, vol. ii. p. 501). We do not otherwise know who Organa or Urkhan was, but from the language of Nicephorus he would seem to have been a well-known personage at the time, and I would suggest that he was the lord of the Huns, who, according to the same author, in the very beginning of the reign of Heraclius went to Constantinople with his guards and a great number of his chief people to profess the Christian religion, when the grandees of the Empire became sponsors at the font for the chief personages of the Huns. Heraclius, we are told, then gave their king presents, and also the title of Patrician (op. cit. vol. i. ch. iii.). To revert, however, to the feud between the Avars and the Hunnugundurs. Fredegar apparently refers to these events in another way. He says that in the 9th year of Dagobert, there was a great commotion in Pannonia about the election of a king, as to whether he should be an Avar or a Bulgarian. The rival parties fought, and the Bulgarians were beaten, and 9000 of them, who had been expelled from Pannonia with their wives and children, went to Dagobert, the Frank king (Fredegar, ch. lxxii.; see Howorth, the Bulgarians, Journ. Anthr. Inst. vol. xi. p. 223).\n\nThe Kubrat above named is clearly the same person as Kuber, a Hun mentioned in the life of St. Demetrius, who was set over a part of his people by the Avar Khan in the district about Sirmium, and who afterwards rebelled against him, crossed the Danube and settled in the plain of Karamesios. See Acta Saint, the fourth volume for October, and Howorth, art. Bulgarians, above cited.\n\nIn a paper which I published some time ago in the Transactions of the Anthropological Institute, I endeavoured to\nshow that the Croats were so called, not as has been supposed from their having lived in the mountains (Khrebeti in Slave), but from this Kubrat, Khrobati or Horvath, and that, like other southern Slaves, they were led by a caste of Hunnic origin. Traces of these Hunnic Croats are in my view still to be found in the title Ban in use among the Croats, and perhaps also in the peculiarities of the so-called Morlaks, a clan in Croatia which it has been urged is of Tartar or Kirghiz origin, and upon which I have written at greater length in a paper I published in the Memoirs of the Anthropological Institute on the Croats. Others deem them descended from the Avars.\n\nI am disposed to think that these true Croats were not merely of Hunnic origin, but were true Huns, or, as they were at this time called, Bulgars. Constantine Porphyrogenitus, in describing the settlement of the Croats in Croatia, tells us that Heraclius, being much distressed at the way in which the Avars were devastating Dalmatia, made overtures to some princes of the Khrobati, offering them, if they drove out the Avars from that district, to allow them to settle there. They accordingly marched under five brothers, one of whom, called Kubrat, conquered the Avars in Illyria, and occupied the country. Elsewhere he tells us the Khrobati came from White Krobata, and having fought for several years with the Avars in Dalmatia, vanquished them and occupied the country, and he goes on to say, \"There still remain some of the Abaras in Krobata\" (Const. de ad Imp. xxx. p. 95).\n\nThe five brothers, of whom one was named Kubrat, I venture to identify with the five sons of Kubrat mentioned by Nicephorus. Nicephorus tells us that on the death of Kubrat, and during the reign of Constantine II. (642\u2013669), one of his five sons led a body of Bulgars into the Avarian Pannonia, and submitted to the Avar Khakan. However we are to reconcile the various statements, what I would urge is, that the Croats of Croatia are a race of Slaves governed by a Bulgarian caste, and derive their name from the Bulgarian chief Kubrat, and that when we speak of the Croats settling in Croatia, we in effect mean a colony of\nBulgars invading and dispossessing the Avars of Dalmatia, while the main body remained encamped between the Theiss and the Dnieper in eastern Hungary, Transylvania, Moldavia, and Wallachia, etc.\n\nThe Croats were not the only Hunnie race which separated from the Avars and settled south of the Danube. According to the Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, Heraclius also invited the Serbii to occupy the districts of Pagania, Zaehlumia, Terbunia and the district of the Canalit\u00e6 which had been devastated by the incursions of the Avars, and was then lying waste. The Serbii of Constantine are the Seberenses of Theophanes, who tells us they formed seven tribes who were settled in the district between the country of the Avars, the Beregabian Pass, and the Eastern Marshes. As I have elsewhere argued, they were the Hunnie race of the Sabiri, who conquered and ruled over Slaves. East of them were settled the seven tribes of the Slavini, who had probably at the same time occupied the district round Varna, and who were even then perhaps ruled by a Bulgarian easte. Thus M\u0153sia, on the invitation of the Romans themselves, was occupied by warlike races who had a special interest in protecting the Empire from the attacks of the Avars, and we read of no more such attacks, and Avaria, or the land of the Avars, was now in fact limited to a comparatively small area, namely, Hungary west of the Theiss, and their subsequent dealings were almost confined to struggles with the Bavarians and Franks, and intercourse with the Lombards in Italy.\n\nIn the year 662 we find the Avars taking part in the affairs of Italy. Aripert, chief of the Lombards, died in the year 661, dividing his empire between his sons Pertharit and Gondebert, the one with his capital at Milan, the other at Pavia. Their quarrels invited the interference of Grimoald, Duke of Beneventum, who marched on Pavia and treacherously assassinated Gondebert. Thereupon Pertharit abandoned his wife and son and sought refuge beyond the Alps with the Khakan of the Avars, with whom he remained two years (Paul. Diae.lib.iv.ch.31). Meanwhile Grimoald informed\nthe Avar chief that peace between them was impossible so long as he sheltered his enemy, and he offered him a basin full of gold if he would either kill or surrender him to be killed. According to Eddius, in his life of St. Wilfred, the Avar chief had sworn to his guest, in the presence of the idol his god, never to surrender him to his foes, and invoked his vengeance if he did so. He was not, however, in a position to wage war with the Lombards, and although he would not deliver him up to Grimoald's messengers, he ordered him to leave his country, and to go wherever he pleased, so long as he did not cause trouble between the Avars and the Lombards. This story was taken down from Pertharit's own narrative many years after (Eddius vita St. Wilf. Mabillon in app. tom. iv. Snc. Benedicti, p. 69). Pertharit first returned to Italy, where he sought the clemency of Grimoald, and eventually fled to France (Paul. Diae. v. 2).\n\nEight years later, we find the Avars again having intercourse with the Lombards and on friendly terms with Grimoald. While the latter was absent in the South of Italy, Lupus, Duke of Friuli, to whom he had confided the government during his absence, revolted. Grimoald, not wishing to have a civil strife among the Lombards, sent to ask the Khakan to put down the rebel. He was doubtless pleased enough with the duty, and advanced with two armies, he himself leading one. He encountered Lupus at Fiume on the Adriatic. The Khakan at once attacked him with the division he had with him. The struggle, we are told, lasted for three days without much advantage to either side, when the second division of the Avars was seen advancing. The rebel army then decamped, leaving the dead and wounded, including Lupus himself. The Avars thereupon laid waste the open country, burning and destroying the trees and crops, and killing the people, desolating Friuli, the so-called pearl of Lombardy. Grimoald now returned, and having thanked the Avar chief for his help, implored him to return, ere he had utterly destroyed so fair a province. The Khakan replied that the province was his, since he had conquered it with his sword, nor would he surrender it.\nGrimoald, although most of his men were away, determined at once to attack the enemy, who sent two envoys or rather spies to his camp. The Lombard chief suspected their errand, and caused the same troops to defile past them several times in different costumes. They were deceived, and on reporting what they had seen to the Khakan, he at once raised his camp and withdrew (Paul. Diac. lib. v. chh. 19\u201321).\n\nA few years later, namely, in the year 677, the Khakan of the Avars, with the rulers of the neighbouring provinces, and the generals castaldi and other grandees of the western nations, sent envoys to the Emperor of Byzantium with gifts to confirm peace. The Emperor gladly assented (Theophanes). This is the last time we read of any intercourse between the Avars and the Eastern Empire.\n\nIt was some time before this that the first efforts were made to convert the Avars. It was a native of Poitiers, named Emmeramius, who conceived the idea, and set out for the purpose, reaching Ratisbon in the year 649, but was stopped en route by the Bavarians, who probably for some reason of state policy were unwilling that the Avars should be converted by a Frank missionary, and become allies of the Franks again. After having been kept in confinement for some time, he was killed by a party of Bavarian robbers. He was treated by the Church as a martyr, and is known as St. Emmeramius. It was not till the year 696 that another effort was made to Christianize the Avars. This was at the instance of Rudbert, or Rupert, Bishop of Worms. He arrived at Regensburg. The Bavarians, who had suffered a good deal at the hands of Pepin of Heristal, were in a more conciliatory humour, and having spent some weeks at Regensburg strengthening the somewhat dubious Christianity of the Bavarians, he proceeded along the right bank of the Danube until he reached the outlet of the Save, which formed the boundary between the Avars and the Greek Empire. There he left his boat, and then advanced into Pannonia, where the Avars did not molest him; and eventually settled at Lorsch on the Danube, which he made the focus of his missionary efforts, which he extended into Carinthia and beyond the\nHartberg (Mons Durus). He apparently built churches and founded monasteries, and having left them in the charge of responsible priests, he himself retired to Passau.\n\nThe early Christian missionary was too often the political agent. Whether it was that the priests began to interfere in the affairs of the Avars or not, we do find the latter taking sharp revenge upon them, and are told that in the year 736 they attacked and desolated the town of Lorsch, and the Bishop Vivilo and priests there would have been slaughtered, if they had not left the place, taking with them the ornaments and sacred vessels from the church (Germ. Sacra. vol. i. p. 121; Mon. Boic. i. p. 119). We are told the town of Lorsch was so completely destroyed that no vestige of it remained, save the Basilica of St. Laurence. This attack was followed by similar attacks on the part of the Bulgarians, the dispute being mainly as to the claims of the Avars upon the Enns, as the western limit of their dominion. After repeated struggles, the advantage remained with the Bavarians, and the Avars were driven back to the defile which now covers Vienna on the west, and to Mount Comagena, and the branch of the ancient Cettian Alps now called the Kalenberg, and Mount Comagena received the name of Khunberg, i.e. Mountain of the Huns (vide Germ. Sacra, vol. i. p. 5, vol. ii. p. 71; Thierry, vol. ii. p. 135). These frontier struggles, in which the Avars could not hold their own even against the Bavarians, are a good measure of the weakness which had overtaken them.\n\nThe mention of the Bulgarians so far west is enigmatical, unless we are to understand that either the ruler of the Bulgarians had sent a contingent to help the Avars, or that a Bulgarian community still subsisted alongside of the Avars in Pannonia, which is more probable.\n\nWe now approach the concluding chapter in the history of the Avars, when, shorn of their power and prestige, they became the victims of the ambition and warlike skill of Karl the Great. Their intercourse began in a friendly way. In the year 782, when Karl held his great May meeting at Lippspring, envoys went to him from the Khakan\nand from the Jugur (a Cagano et Jugurro), chiefs of the Avars. The Annals tells us he heard them and dismissed them (Ann. Laur. p. 162, Annales Einhardti, Pertz, vol. i. p. 163). Both annalists use the terms Caganus and Jugurrus as proper names, and Zeuss accepts the latter as unmistakably so (vide Die Deutsche, etc., p. 740, note). It has also been identified with the tribal name Uighur, which seems improbable, as the latter is a rare name. It is curious to read in the Annales St. Emmer. Ratis. Pertz, vol. i. p. 92, under the year 783, that the Huns advanced as far as the Enisa, i.e. the Euns, their frontier towards Bavaria, but did not proceed further. The date Abel suggests is a year too late, and he connects this demonstration against Bavaria with the embassy to Karl (Jahrb. des Frankischen Reiches, vol. i. p. 351, note 1).\n\nTassilo, the chief of Bavaria, who formerly had been much punished and dispossessed by Karl, naturally had small affection for him, and we now find him taking active steps against him. Inter alia, he made advances to the Avars for an alliance. This was probably in the year 786 (Ann. Laur. Pertz, vol. i. p. 172). Karl now found himself with the double duty on his hands of facing the Greeks in Italy and Tassilo and his allies in Central Germany. We are told that the latter made a treaty with the Avars, by which they undertook during the year 788 to send one army to the March of Friauli to help the Greeks, and another to Bavaria; the latter was perhaps to put pressure on the unwilling Bavarians, Tassilo\u2019s own subjects, to attack the Franks (Ann. Laur. Pertz, vol. i. p. 174; Ann. Einhardti, id. p. 173). In the spring of 788 Karl, having apparently his suspicions, and having also the sympathy of the Bavarian grandees, summoned Tassilo to meet him at Ingelheim. He had to go, and when there confessed his various intrigues, including his alliance with the Avars. Tassilo was duly deposed, and became a monk, and thus ended the independence of Bavaria.\n\nThe collapse of Tassilo did not prevent the Avars from carrying out the campaign which they had projected. They sent an army to Friauli to act in concert with the Greeks, which was, however, attacked by the Franks, and driven\naway. Another army invaded Bavaria. They were met and defeated by the Franks and Bavarians under the Counts Graham and Audaker or Odoaker, at a place called Ibose, doubtless situated on the Ips, in the eastern part of Bavaria. The Avars were annoyed to find enemies instead of allies in the Bavarians, and to revenge themselves, they made a third attack upon the latter, who were again assisted by the Imperial Legates, which was similarly repelled. A great multitude of Avars, we are told, were killed, and others were drowned in the Danube (Ann. Laur. Ann. Einh. Pertz, vol. i. pp. 174-5; Abel, op. cit. p. 528).\n\nIn the year 790 Karl held his Diet at Worms. There went there envoys from the Avars, and he duly sent envoys in return (Annales Einhardti, Pertz, vol. i. p. 177). The matters in dispute, which were discussed by these embassies, were the perpetually recurring question of the frontier, and also the attacks made by the Avars upon the Bavarian marches (Einhardti, Annales, id.; Ann. Laur. ad an. 791; Abel, vol. ii. p. 11 and note). Karl the Great had made up his mind to subdue these dangerous neighbours effectually. He accordingly made exceptional preparations, both of men and provisions, and the annalists specially refer to the vast armament he collected, including several thousand horses, and which assembled at Regensburg, or Ratisbon, in the spring of 791. The army was divided into three divisions; one of them comprising the Ripuarian Franks, and a large contingent of Saxons, Friesians, and Thuringians was commanded by Count Theodoric and the Chamberlain Meginfred. They marched along the northern bank of the Danube and through the southern part of Bohemia. The second army, under Karl himself, composed apparently of Franks and Alamanni, marched south of the Danube through Bavaria. The Bavarians themselves formed a third army, which marched along the river between the other two, and conveyed the provisions. These were carried in boats which were apparently manned by Friesian sailors (Ann. Laur. Pertz, vol. i. p. 176; Ann. Einh. id. p. 177; Ann. Lauresham. Pertz, vol. i. p. 34). With the army there also went Engelram, Archbishop of\nMetz, and Bishops Sindpert of Ratisbon, Arno of Salzburg, and Otto of Freisingen. The first two apparently died during the campaign (Abel and Simson, vol. ii. p. 20).\n\nBesides these three main armies, a fourth was sent from Italy to the Avar frontier. This was accompanied inter alios by John Duke of Istria, two counts, a bishop, etc. (Epist. Car. 6, 349\u201350).\n\nThe Italian army was the first to strike a blow. It advanced into Illyricum, and thence into Pannonia (Ann. Lauresham. Pertz, vol. i. p. 34), and on the 23rd of August it inflicted a severe defeat on the Avars; a large number of them were killed, and their camp, or so-called Ring, was stormed and plundered. After this the victors withdrew with their booty and with 150 prisoners, whom they detained until orders should arrive from Karl about their disposal (Epist. Karl. Mag. ad Fastrad\u00e6).\n\nKarl himself advanced to the Enns, expressly called the frontier between the Bavarians and the Avars. There he received a messenger from Pepin telling him that things were going on well in Italy. There also he ordered a three days' religious ceremony to be performed, in which the blessings of heaven were invoked upon the approaching campaign. This lasted from the 5th to the 7th of September (Abel, p. 350; Ann. Laur. Pertz, vol. i. p. 176; Einhardt, Ann. p. 177). The ceremony is described in a letter still extant written by Karl to his wife Fastrada, whom he had left at Ratisbon. The bishops ordered abstinence from meat and wine during the three days above mentioned, except for the very old and young. The rich were allowed to buy exemption from the fast by paying a solidus a day, and the poorer folk by a corresponding sacrifice. The bishops were themselves to recite their masses, and the clerics to repeat 50 psalms, and during the processions of the litanies to go barefoot (Epist. Carl. 6, Jaffe, vol. iv. pp. 349\u2013351).\n\nKarl now advanced, the first part of his march being through the district so frequently devastated in the wars between the Bavarians and the Avars. He met with no resistance till he reached the Cuncoberg (or Chunberg as\nRegino calls it), near the town Comagenca (close to the Tula below Klosterneburg, Abel, vol. ii. p. 23), where the Avars had one of their Rings.\n\nA similar Ring was situated north of the Danube on the route which Theodoric and Meginfred had to traverse. This was on the river Kamp, which rises in Bohemia, flows through the valley of Zwetl, and falls into the Danube below Krembs (Pertz, vol. i. p. 176, note).\n\nThe contemporary authorities are unanimous in the statement that when the Avars noticed the advance of the two armies they did not wait to be attacked, but fled and abandoned their fortresses (Ann. Laur. Pertz, vol. i. p. 176; Einh. Ann. id. p. 177). The annals of Lorsch expressly say, \"Ubicumque aut fossas aut aliquam firmitatem sive in montibus seu ad flumina aut in silvis factam habuerunt, statim, ut ipse aut exercitus ejus ibi advenit continuo aut se tradiderunt aut occisi sunt aut per fuga delapsi (Ann. Lauresh. Pertz, vol. i. p. 34).\n\nKarl now advanced to the Raab, which he crossed, followed its right bank to its outfall into the Danube, and having stayed there some days, returned by way of Sabaria (i.e. Stein on the Anger near Sarvar). His march lasted 52 days, during which the country was terribly devastated with fire and sword. The same results no doubt attended the march of the army led by Theodoric and Meginfred which returned home through Bohemia. A vast booty and many prisoners, men, women and children, were captured. We also read that a pestilence broke out among the horses in Karl's own army, and hardly one in ten survived (Einhardt, Ann. Pertz, vol. i. p. 177; Ann. Laur. id. p. 178; Ann. Lauresh. id. p. 34). From these notices it would appear that the Avar campaign was prosecuted with little, if any actual fighting on the part of the Franks, nor do I know whence Thierry derived his rhetorical notice.\n\nIn order to be safe against attack, if the Avars should wish to avenge themselves, Karl passed the summer and winter at Regensburg in Bavaria. We do not read of any fresh strife, however, for a year or two, although in 792 the Saxons seem to have invited the Avars to join them in a\ncampaign (Ann. Lauresh. Pertz, vol. i. p. 35). Karl himself was anxious to march into Pannonia. He built a bridge across the Danube to facilitate his operations, and was also persuaded to try and make a canal between the Rednitz and the Altmuhl to connect the Rhine and Danube. His plans against the Avars were disturbed, however, by an attack of the Saxons on one of his armies which was marching through Friesia and which was destroyed (Einh. Ann. Pertz, vol. i. p. 179). We next read of a chief of the Avars either entitled or named Tudun, who in the year 795, sent to offer to put his people and country under the Frank yoke, and proposed to become a Christian himself. He was clearly not the Khakan (Ann. Laur. Pertz, vol. i. p. 180; Ann. Einh. id. p. 181). The next year we read of a civil feud among the Avars, caused probably by the negotiations of Tudun. In it we are told the Khakan and Jugurrus were killed. Probably tempted by this strife, Karl, who was determined to put an end to the dangers which menaced him continually on the side of Pannonia, and who was doubtless also attracted by the prospects of a vast booty, seems to have ordered an invasion of the Avar country by the army of Friauli, under Count Erie, who was accompanied by a Slave chief named Woinimir. He marched straight upon one of the great Rings of the Avars, which he captured, and a large booty was sent to Aachen. This was apparently in the late autumn of 795 (Abel and Simson, vol. ii. p. 99).\n\nSimson identifies this Ring with the traces found at Sartosar near Tatar (see Riezler, p. 182, note 1, in the Anzeiger f. kunde d. Deutschen Vorzeit, f. 6, 1859, sp. 39, Abel and Simson, vol. ii. p. 100). The Monk of St. Gallen grows very rhetorical in describing the vast treasures carried off, and of which we can form some idea when we remember that the Avars had drawn an annual tribute of 80,000 to 100,000 golden pieces from the Byzantines, and on one occasion had received as many as 200,000 from Heraclius.\n\nCharlemagne distributed some of this plunder, in gifts and we read how he sent a present to Rome. This he commissioned Count Angelbert to take ad limina Apostolorum (Ann. Laur. Pertz, vol. i. p. 182). Aleuin tells us how he\nsent to Offa, King of Mercia, a Hunnic sword and sword-belt and two silken cloaks. While the Northumbrian Annals tell us that fifteen great waggons, each drawn by four oxen, were laden with the gold, silver and silken treasures, etc., carried off (op. cit. ad ann. 795).\n\nIt was apparently in the latter part of 795 that Tudun, whose previous submission I have mentioned, went in person with a considerable following to Aachen, and duly submitted himself with his people. They were baptized, Karl treated him and his people with great honour, and distributed gifts among them (Ann. Laur. Pertz, vol. i. p. 182; Einh. id. p. 183). Theodulf, who addressed a poem to Karl in the spring of 796, mentions the baptism, and refers to the plaited hair hanging down from their heads which the Avars wore (see Theodulf, Carmen, 37, etc.; Abel and Simson, p. 119). Later in the year Karl sent Pepin to prosecute the war in the more eastern parts of Pannonia. He crossed the Danube with an army of Lombards, Bavarians, and Alemanni. Meanwhile the new Khakan of the Avars, who had replaced the one killed the year before, as I have mentioned, and who is called Kaia or Kaiam in the Annales Mettenses, went with his Terkhans, and placed himself and his kingdom under the yoke of Karl (see Rhythmus de Peppini victoria Avarica, str. 10-12; Ann. Laur. Pertz, vol. i. p. 182; Einh. Ann. id. p. 183; Ann. Lauresham. id. p. 37; Ann. Mett, etc.). It is possible that Kaia is a corruption of Khakan. The embassy did not stay Pepin\u2019s march. He captured the great Royal Ring (apparently it was the same which Eric had taken the year before) which he destroyed, and then drove a number of fugitive Avars across the Theiss. He also carried off the rest of the treasure, which had been left behind by Eric, and took it to his father at Aachen.\n\nThe Monk of St. Gallen reports how his foster-father, the soldier Adalbert, had told him of a soldier from Dordogne, who if not a Gascon by blood, had evidently acquired the Gascon habit of boasting. He took part in these Avar campaigns, and said he had cut down the Huns with his sword as you cut down hay, and as to the Wends, these frogs\nhe declared that he had spitted seven or eight of them on his spear, and carried them about in spite of their cries (Monachus, St. Gallen, ii. 20). He also captured many prisoners, among whom was Ayo of Friauli, who had fled in the troubles of recent years, and sought refuge there, and who took a prominent part in later history. Alcuin corresponded with Karl about the redemption of the Avar prisoners (see his letters). The power of the Avars was now crushed. Eginhardt, writing about ten years later, thus describes the Royal Ring: \"locus in quo regia Kagani erat, ita desertus, ut ne vestigium quidem in eo humanae habitationis appareat\" (op. cit.). Pepin summoned a meeting of Bishops and others on the Danube, to discuss how the Avars were to be converted and taught the Christian faith. Alcuin's description of them does not seem very hopeful: \"Haec autem gens bruta et irrationabilis vel certe idiota et sine literis tardior atque laboriosa ad cognoscenda sacra mysteria invenitur.\" The adoption of Christianity with them, as with the Norsemen, was largely a political piece of diplomacy.\n\nNext year, i.e. in 797, Eric Duke of Friauli, with an army of Franks and Lombards, made another invasion of the Avar land, and won a victory over the Avars, here called Vandals (Ann. Alemann. Pertz, vol. i. p. 48; Abel and Simson, vol. ii. p. 133). The same year envoys from the Avars went to Karl at Heristal, and took with them handsome gifts (Ann. Laur. Pertz, vol. i. p. 182; Einh. Ann. id. p. 183).\n\nTwo years later, namely, in 799, the Avars, fell away from the allegiance they had promised (Ann. Laur. Pertz, vol. i. p. 186; Ann. Einh. id. p. 182). This apparently refers to Tudun and his companions, who is said in the Annals of Einhardt to have fallen away not long after his baptism, and to have paid the penalty of his fault. Leibnitz (Ann. Imp. i. 190), apparently quoting some authority unknown to us, tells us his eyes were removed and his fingers cut off (Abel and Simson, p. 119). To punish the defection, Gerold, the Governor of Bavaria, marched into Pannonia. He fell, with two companions who were riding by him, in a battle with the Avars (Einhardt, Vit. Car. p. 13; Pertz, vol. ii. p. 450;\nAnn. Laur. ad an.). Gerold was brother to Karl's wife, Hildegar. His body was removed to the Abbey of Reichenau, and on his tomb were inscribed *inter alia* the words,\n\nPannoniis vera Ecclesia pro pace pcremptus\nOppetit saevo septemtribus ensa calendis.\n\nD. Bouq. vol. i. v. 400.\n\nDuring the winter of 802-3 Karl sent an army into Pannonia (Ann. Mett. ad an.), and in the latter year we read in the same annals that Zodan, Prince of Pannonia, with many Slaves and Huns, placed their land once more under the yoke of the Franks. Zodan is treated by Abel and Simson as a form of the name Tudun, but they make him another person than the Tudun above named (*op. cit.* vol. ii. p. 297). I have no doubt he was the same person. Tudun is called Zotan in the Annales Guelferbytanorum, under the year 795, and in the Annals Juvavenses sub. ann. 796. Karl took this opportunity of rearranging the administration of Pannonia and the south-eastern marks, \"Imperator autem in Baioariam profectus dispositis Pannoniarum causis\" (*Einh. Ann. Pertz*, vol. i. p. 191). Thierry tells us that, according to the ancient acts, he nominated five Counts of the Pannonian frontier, namely, Gontram, Werenhar or Berengar, Albric, Gotefrid, and Gerold (*op. cit.* vol. ii. p. 188). I do not find this latter statement, however, in the very detailed account of Abel and Simson. He also placed a portion of Pannonia under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Salzburg, viz. that part of it bounded by the Raab, the Drave, and the Danube, and including the Platten See (*Tract. de Convers. Bavariae*, ch. viii. sec. 10; Abel and Simson, vol. ii. p. 299, note).\n\nIn the early spring of 805 there came to Aachen to interview the Emperor, the Khakan of the Avars, asking him to find him and his people new quarters between Sabaria and Carnuntum, *i.e.* between Stein on the Anger, and Petronell, near Heinburg, the frontier town of Austria, since they could not live in their old ones, inasmuch as they were so harassed there by the Slaves (*Einhardt, Annales, Pertz*, vol. i. p. 192). This is confirmed by the tract on the Conversion of Bavaria,\nwhere we read that at this time the Slaves and Bavarians began to occupy the country from which the Huns were driven out (Abel and Simson, vol. ii. p. 321, note). This proves how crushed the Avars now were. The Khakan was named Theodore, which was possibly the Christian name of the Avar ruler last mentioned. The Kaizar granted his request, and sent him away with presents. He died, however, soon after reaching home (Einhardt Annales, Pertz, vol. i. p. 192).\n\nThe new Khakan sent one of his chieftains to ask Karl to grant him the same position and status which had been possessed by other Avar Khakans. The Emperor granted the request, and the new Khakan was installed with the same ceremonies, and was allowed the title and honours of the old ones (Einhardt, Ann. Pertz, p. 192). He was baptized with the name Abraham at Fiskaha (i.e. on the river Fischa), on the 21st September, 805 (Ann. Juwav. Pertz, vol. i. p. 87; Ann. St. Emmer. Ratis. id. p. 93).\n\nIt would seem from such evidence as we possess that the whole of what remained of the Avar nation now migrated, and in order to understand the position we must remember what a terrible devastation and destruction was involved in campaigns like those of Karl the Great in Pannonia. His biographer, Eginhardt, writing some years after, thus enlarges upon the subject. After mentioning that the Avar war was the greatest, next to the Saxon, in which Karl took part: \"He only took part in person in one campaign, the others were fought by his son Pepin and his generals.\" \"The campaign,\" says Eginhardt, \"was conducted with the greatest skill and vigour, and lasted eight years. Pannonia, now divested of inhabitants, vacua omni habitatorv, Pannonia, with its royal residence so destroyed that not a vestige of it remains, witnesses the number of combats fought, and the quantity of blood shed. The whole noblesse of the Huns has been destroyed, their glory has perished, and their treasures, accumulated during many centuries, have been captured and dispersed. We cannot recall an expedition in which the Franks were so much enriched, for formerly they may be said to have been poor;\nbut they found in the palace of the Khakans so much gold and silver, and so much spoil on the field of battle, that it may be justly said the Franks have very rightly recovered from the Huns that which the latter have so unjustly taken from the rest of the world\u201d (Egin. Vit. Car. M. 13; Pertz, vol. ii. p. 450).\n\nThis narrative points to the campaigns of Karl the Great in Pannonia having had the same ultimate motive as the buccaneering expeditions of Cortez and Pizarro, namely, plunder. In regard to their effects, it would almost seem as if they matched the recent campaigns of the Chinese in Sungaria.\n\nLet us revert, however. As we have seen, the Avars were transported to the west of the Danube. The district to which they were moved had been devastated by Karl in the war of 796. It had been waste also in earlier times, for it would seem to be identical with the deserta Boiorum of Pliny (see Hunfalvy, Ethnographie von Ungarn, pp. 44, 104, and note 54).\n\nThe condition of things east of the Danube, including Eastern Hungary and Transylvania, from this time to the invasion of the Hungarians at the end of the century, is one of the darkest pages in European history, and the paucity of information has only increased the floods of conjecture, and the very natural polemics which conjecture generally induce. It is very probable that some portions of it remained waste and unoccupied, a considerable part doubtless fell to the Moravians, but another part, including Transylvania and Wallachia, became subject to the kings of Bulgaria. Our authorities are largely limited to the unsatisfactory pages of Suidas, who tells us that the Bulgarians were much attracted by the Avar costume. They accordingly adopted it, and discarded their own, and continued to use it when Suidas wrote. The same Bulgarians, he goes on to say, forcibly subdued the Avars, and Krum, the Bulgarian King, interrogated his Avar captives, and asked them how it came about that their ruler and people had been completely undone. They replied that it was by mutual\nstrife, and they had thus lost their strongest and most prudent men, who had been replaced by the unjust and the robber. Drunkenness had also prevailed much among them; they had been corrupted by bribes, while many of them had devoted themselves to trade, and had taken to cheating each other. Krum duly applied these facts, and concluded his homily to his subjects with the ominous phrase, \"All the Avars, therefore, have been overwhelmed by the Bulgarians\" (Suidas, Eclogues, pp. 37\u201338; Stritter, vol. ii. p. 562\u2013563). From this passage we learn that Krum, who was at this time a most powerful ruler, and who certainly controlled a considerable territory north of the Danube, known as Bulgaria beyond the Danube, also conquered the Avars.\n\nRoesler has called in question the existence of a Bulgaria north of the Danube, and Nicephorus (Greg. Hist. Byz. c. ix. p. 391) speaks of a \"Bulgaria on this side of the Danube,\" and an anonymous account of Leo, son of Barda (p. 345), speaks of a Bulgaria beyond the Danube. It was thither that Krum sent the prisoners he captured at Adrianople in the year 813 (see Pic, Dic. Abstannum der Rumanen). That the Bulgarians were also masters of Transylvania appears from the Fulda Annals, Pertz, vol. i. p. 408, where we read how Arnulf, in his war with the Moravians, in the year 563, sent to ask Wladimir to stop the supply of salt to his enemies (Fulda Ann. Pertz, vol. i. p. 374). Pic has shown that the only salt works then in use were those of Marmarosch and Transylvania, which must therefore have been in the hands of the Bulgars (Pic, op. cit. pp. 73, 74). The references in the Fulda Annals in the years 863 and 886 also point to the Bulgarians and Moravians having then been neighbours. Another piece of evidence is the name Pesth, which is a Bulgarian gloss, and which, in the other Slavic dialects, takes the forms piec, pi\u0107, pec, kopetar (see Roesler, Romanische Studien, p. 205). These various facts seem only consistent with the Bulgarians being masters at this time of the old Avar dominion east of the Danube.\n\nAccording to the Byzantine chronicler, the army of Krum,\nthe Bulgarian king, when he attacked Constantinople *circa* 814, comprised also Avars and Slaves (Stritter, vol. ii. p. 561). These Avars were, however, mere fugitives, and we must take it as clear that what remained of the nation was now planted west of the Danube, and that Pannonia east of the Danube with Dacia became the prey of the Moravians on the one hand and the Bulgarians on the other.\n\nThe district from Comagena to the Enns now, according to Thierry, took the name of Hunnia, while that east of Mount Cettius was called Avaria (*op. cit.* vol. ii. p. 193).\n\nThe political power of the Avars having been broken, more active efforts were now made to deprive them also of their hostile spirit, by converting them to Christianity, and among the most active in the work, mention is made of a certain Ing or Ingo, Count of Lower Pannonia, who acquired such influence that his mere word or his seal on a scrap of paper was accepted as of equal authority with more formal documents. We are told that when he held meetings of his subordinates, he invited those who were Christians, even if they were low born and mere serfs, to dine at his own table, and drink out of golden cups, while their masters and other great people, who were still pagans, were left outside the door, and were treated as mendicants, to whom bread and meat, and a little wine in common vessels were distributed. Some Avar chiefs, having asked a reason for this strange conduct, he replied that impure people like them had no business to communicate with men who had been regenerated by baptism, their place was that of dogs outside the house. The old narrative goes on to say that the noble Huns were thus persuaded to be converted and baptized (*Tract. de Convers. Bajor. Duchesne*, ii., Thierry, vol. ii. pp. 189\u2013190).\n\nThis same year Karl issued certain instructions to the Imperial commissaries, among which it is interesting to find some regulations about trade in the country of the Slaves and Avars. In these regulations it was provided that the merchants should not go beyond a certain line joining the Elbe and the outfall of the Enns into the Danube, and\npassing through Bardowick, Scheessel, Magdeburg, Erfurt, Halazstat (Hallstadt north of Bamberg), Forchheim, Pfreinst, Ratisbon, or Regensburg, and Lorch, which were doubtless treated as the markets (Abel and Simson, vol. ii. pp. 332). In the year 811 we read how Karl sent an army to Pannonia to try and settle the chronic disputes about their frontiers between the Slaves and Avars (Einhardt, Annales, Pertz, vol. i. p. 190), and in November of the same year there arrived at Aachen, to interview the Emperor on this question, and sent by the commander of the forces, Canizauci, the chief of the Avars, Tudun, and other grandees (primores is the word used, it probably answers to terkhans), and the leaders of the Slaves living near the Danube (Einhardt, Ann. id.). Dummler has suggested that the name Canizauci is a corruption of Khan, and some name of which we have only perhaps an echo in izauci or zauci. He was doubtless the Khan of the Avars at that time (see Abel and Simson, vol. ii. p. 472).\n\nThis is the last mention we find of the Avars during the reign of Karl the Great, who died in the year 814. When his successor, Louis made his famous division of his territories among his sons, we are told he left to his son Louis, otherwise known as the German, Bavaria and the country of the Karantani, Bohemians, Avars and Slaves.\n\nIn 819 there broke out the rebellion in Pannonia, which was headed by Liudewit, who is called Duke of Lower Pannonia. In this outbreak the Avars apparently took a part.\n\nIn 822 we are told the Avars sent envoys to Aachen to the Emperor Louis with presents (Einhardt, Ann. Pertz, vol. i. p. 209). This was probably to appease him after their recent compromising alliance with Liudewit. In the year 826 they occur in history for the last time as a separate community. They are named in a brief of Pope Eugenius II., addressed to the nations in the valley of the Danube, and to their chiefs, especially to the Khakan Tutundus, and to Moymar, Duke of Moravia. In this brief he pressed them to restore the ancient sees which existed in their country in the time of the Romans and the Gepidae, and he further counselled them to devote a portion of their lands to endowing new sees, and\nto paying additional pastors, since some of their people were still pagans. He bade them help Archbishop Urolf, who was their supreme pastor, and who would complete the number of necessary sees, either by restoring the old ones or founding new ones. When bishops were thus duly appointed, they could restore the churches, if only means were found for building and endowing them (Epist. Eug. P. ad Chag. ann. 826; Thierry, op. cit. pp. 196\u2013197).\n\nAlmost fifty years later we find them referred to in a passage of the author of the Tract on the Conversion of the Bavarians and Carinthians, already referred to, and written by an anonymous scribe of Salzburg, writing under Bishop Adalwin. He wrote about the year 870, shortly before the arrival of the Magyars, and says: \"The Huns expelled the Romans, the Goths, and the Gepidae from Lower Pannonia, and took possession of it, until the Franks, the Bavarians, and the Carantani subdued them in continuous wars. Those, however, who were baptized, and were obedient to the faith, became tributaries to the king, and retain their land as tributaries even to this day (op. cit. p. 7). This was a mere fragment of the race, however, and it was doubtless absorbed presently in the surrounding population, or joined the Magyars. When Nestor wrote of 1115 he could say all are swept away, not an Avar remains. \"So that,\" he adds, \"the Russians have a proverb: They have disappeared like the Avars, no relations, no descendants remain of them\" (op. cit. ed. Paris, vol. ii. p. 113).\n\nIn the Fulda Annals they are confused with the Hungarians, and are referred to as Avari qui dicuntur Hungari, vide sub ann. 894, and Pertz, vol. i. pp. 410\u2013413, but this is, of course, a mistake.\n\nWhat remained was absorbed, and disappeared as a separate nationality. The Avars had never been a numerous race; they were rather the leaders of other races; and the reason we have treated their history in such detail is because it forms a very complete episode in European history, and because, although they came and passed away, without leaving behind them a definite community, they probably had more\nto do with the great race-movements in Eastern Europe, at a critical and very obscure period of its history, than any other invaders. It is certainly curious what very small direct traces of themselves they left behind.\n\nHunfalvy speaks with some surprise of the lack of monuments left by the Avars. We do not, for instance, know a single place-name which we can attribute to them, but this is surely most consistent with their origin and character. So far as we know, they were herdsmen and soldiers, and knew nothing of agriculture. Like the modern Kalmuks, they had summer and winter quarters, and, as we have seen, passed their winters among the Slaves. Their settlements were called Camps by the Lombards and Rings by the Franks, and they were so called apparently from their shape. These great raths, surrounded by earthen dykes, were precisely like the early camps of the Mongolian race, of which their so-called capital, Karakorum, or the Black Rampart, was a notable example. The nature of these Rings has been described for us by the Monk of St. Gallen, who claims to have derived his information from Adalbert, an old soldier who had taken part in the campaign of Gerold. His notice is as follows: \"The land of the Huns was girdled with nine Rings, novem circulis cingebatur. When I replied that I knew of no such fences except those made of osiers, he replied that it (i.e. the land) was fortified with nine hays or banks (novem hegim muniebatur). When I replied I knew of no such banks, except those surrounding cornfields, he replied one such enclosure was as far across as the distance from Zurich to Constance. The banks were made with a double row of piles of oak, beech, or pine, which were twenty feet apart, the space being filled up with stones and loam. The fence thus constructed was twenty feet high. The surface of the bank was covered with sods; on this was planted a row of trees with their branches cut like chevaux de fris. Inside this mound (which was apparently similar to those encircling Irish raths) were scattered the dwellings and villages of the inhabitants, so placed that the voice could be heard from one to another.\nOpposite the dwellings were gateways, which pierced the rampart. At a distance of ten German, or forty Italian miles from the second of these Rings, which was very like the first, was planted a third such Ring, and so on to the ninth, although all were not of the same size. From one Ring to another it was possible to signal by means of trumpets. In these Rings were kept the treasures amassed by the Avars during two centuries of plundering (Pertz, vol. ii. p. 748).\n\nIf this notice is trustworthy, it shows that the Avars actually occupied only a small portion of Pannonia.\n\nHunfalvy suggests that the Rings were the boundaries of the several Avar tribes (op. cit. p. 97). We do not otherwise read, however, of the Avars being divided into tribes. He adds that remains of these Rings are still to be found in the county of B\u00e1cska, and the south of that of Torontal. They are erroneously known as Roman earthworks. They are recorded plainly on Matthias Bel\u2019s map of Hungary (Atlas Hungaricus Belianus, 1750 and 1751; Hunfalvy, p. 398, note 187). I altogether question this attribution, since I know of no good evidence for planting any Avar settlements east of the Theiss, and these vast Hungarian earthworks belong, I believe, to a much earlier age. Of archaeological remains which we can assign to the Avars we have a most scanty list. Hunfalvy tells us that in the National Museum at Pesth are three finds which may be assigned to the period of Avar domination from the coins found with them. There are the find of Kun\u00e1gota, in the county of Csanad, comprising a gold coin of the time of Justinian the First (527\u2013565); that of St. Andrew in the county of Pilsir, with two coins of Justin the First (518\u2013527) and Phokas (602\u2013610); and thirdly, that of Ozora, in the county of Stuhlweissenburg, with a gold coin of the time of Constantine Pogonatos (668).\n\nIn the first of these finds were some vessels and bracelets of base silver. Among the latter is one, funnel-shaped at both ends. Similar bracelets, with funnel terminations, were also among the objects in the find at St. Andrew. In the latter find were also two stirrups. Stirrups were not known\nto the Greeks and Romans, nor are they figured on Sassanian bas-reliefs. These are apparently the earliest known, dating as they do from the sixth century. The Ozora find comprised a number of ornaments, showing a peculiar technique. It included golden bracelets, rings, hair-pins, and buckles ornamented with garnets and dark-red pieces of glass in cloisonn\u00e9e work. This kind of work was unknown at Byzantium, while it was common in the west of Europe during the second period of the migration of the barbarians (Hunfalvy, op. cit. p. 98). I very much doubt these objects having been other than plunder secured by the Avars, who in all probability, like the modern Kazak and Kalmuks, had no arts, save the very simple ones necessary to equip herdsmen, who were also soldiers. The stirrups are curious, but stirrups have occurred in Norse graves in Russia.\n\nThis exhausts what we have been able to discover of remains of the Avar period. They were herdsmen and free-booters, and doubtless were dependent on their neighbours and slaves for their handicrafts, except perhaps that of sword-making. \"Hunnic swords\" are referred to by the Frank chroniclers, by which perhaps Damascened blades are meant, such as those found in such large numbers in a boat at Nydam in Denmark, apparently dating from this period. It may be that even these Hunnic swords were rather derived from Hunnic sources than made by Hunnic hands.\n\nThis completes what I have to say of the Avars. In a subsequent paper I hope to bring together a similar account of the Sabiri, of whom we unfortunately know much less.\nART. XI.\u2014The O'm\u00e1nee Dialect of Arabic. By Surgeon-Major A. S. G. Jayakar, M.R.A.S.\n\n(Continued from page 687.)\n\nPART II.\n\nIn compiling the following vocabulary of 'Omanee words, the principal aim has been to give only such words as exhibit the dialectical peculiarities mentioned in the preceding Part, and not to furnish a complete list of words in common use in O'm\u00e1n. Technical words, or words employed in agriculture, trade, arts, manufactures, etc., have been intentionally omitted, as they would be beyond the scope and extent of the present paper. Most of the words, it will be seen, are of Arabic origin, and the dialectical sense, wherever it differs from the original, is either metaphorical or an extension of the sense conveyed by the original root.\n\nSome words, although purely Arabic, are given here on account of some difference in the plural or aorist, from the original, whilst others have been introduced on account of their being in common use in this dialect, although of rare occurrence in standard Arabic literature.\n\nAs far as practicable the O'm\u00e1nee mode of spelling has been retained throughout, but in the case of verbs with a final \u064a, instead of adopting the O'm\u00e1nee method which consists in substituting in the preterite a full \u0644 for that letter, the usual Arabic rule, for an obvious reason, has been followed. The O'm\u00e1nees are in the habit of pronouncing the final letter of a word when not connected, sharp, so as to drop its vowel altogether, and this practice has been adhered to here, both in the case of O'm\u00e1nee words and their equivalents in standard Arabic, to enable the reader to mark it as a\nstriking peculiarity of the dialect. Wherever the third person singular pronominal suffix occurs either at the end of a noun or a verb, the vowel *dammah* of this pronominal sign is invariably transferred to the penultimate letter, which then takes the vowel sound corresponding to the English *o* as in *bold*, whilst the suffix itself is expressed by a sharp quiescent *h*; this mode of spelling is adopted throughout the vocabulary in the sentences illustrative of the use of O'm\u00e1nee words.\n\nTo enable the reader to comprehend the exact sense conveyed by each word, its equivalent in standard Arabic is given in the second column, whilst in the last column the origin of each word or of its dialectical sense is, as far as practicable, traced and explained. There are some words, however, whose origin is not satisfactorily traced, and therefore only a probable explanation has been suggested in their case; whilst in instances in which no conjecture whatever can be formed, the space under the head of origin is left blank.\n\nBesides the usual grammatical abbreviations, which do not require any explanation, the following other abbreviations are employed in this paper:\n\n- A. Arabic.\n- Guj. Gujer\u00e1thee.\n- H. Hindoostance.\n- P. Persian.\n- Port. Portuguese.\n- S. Sanscrit.\n- Sind. Sindhee.\n\nTo give a complete idea of the general features of this dialect a few of the words most commonly used by children are added at the end of the vocabulary.\n| English       | Standard Arabic | Omanee | Origin, Remarks, Examples, etc. |\n|---------------|-----------------|--------|---------------------------------|\n| Abandon, v.t. | \u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0643\u0652         | \u064a\u064e\u0648\u064e\u062f\u064f\u0651\u0631\u064f aor. | A.

XII.\u2014The B\u00e1b\u00eds of Persia. II. Their Literature and Doctrines. By Edward Granville Browne, M.A., M.R.A.S.\n\nOn a former occasion I described some of my experiences amongst the sect of the B\u00e1b\u00eds in Persia, and gave a short sketch of the history of their appearance and development. In the present paper I propose to speak of their literature and doctrine, so far as these are known to me.\n\nFirst of all, however, it seems desirable to say something of the relations and antecedents of the B\u00e1b\u00ed movement. Now these are of two kinds, which I may call formal and essential. By the formal relations of the sect, I mean the schools of thought wherein M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad the B\u00e1b received his training, and from which he presumably acquired the germs of the doctrine which he subsequently elaborated. By the essential relations, I mean those religious or philosophical movements with which B\u00e1b\u00edism has most similarity, though no external connection can be shown to exist between it and them. In the discussion which followed my last paper, Mr. Kay indicated some very interesting points of resemblance between the B\u00e1b\u00eds and the Isma\u2018\u00edl\u00eds, not only in doctrine and organization, but even in the use of particular terms. Similar resemblances, more or less striking, present themselves in other cases, e.g. the Druses, the Nus\u00e9yris, and certain sects amongst the \u1e62\u00faf\u00eds. Into these latter, however, it is not my intention to enter at present, inasmuch as I do not feel that I possess sufficient knowledge of them to warrant my doing so; and I think that I shall do better to confine myself entirely to the doctrines of the B\u00e1b and his teachers and disciples, leaving to others the task of comparing and contrasting these with other analogous movements.\nBut before passing on to consider what I have described as the formal relations of the sect, I desire briefly to revert to what was said by the above-mentioned speaker concerning the grades of initiation which exist amongst the Isma'ilis.\n\nI have occasionally fancied that something of a similar nature, though less definite, may exist amongst the B\u00e1b\u00eds. That they adapt their conversation to those with whom they are speaking there is no doubt. With a Muhammadan they will speak of the coming of the promised Im\u00e1m Mahd\u00ed, and emphasize the doctrine that the production of verses like those of the Kur'\u00e1n is the essential sign and proof of the prophetic mission. With a Christian they will speak of the expected coming of Christ and the signs thereof, pointing out that if the Christians blame the Jews for not recognizing Christ as the promised Messiah, and failing to understand that the prophecies concerning the kingdom of the latter were intended allegorically and in a spiritual sense, they are equally to blame if they insist on a literal fulfilment of the signs of Christ's coming, and refuse to see that He has returned. So also, in speaking with a Zoroastrian or a S\u00faf\u00ed, they will use arguments likely to commend themselves to their interlocutor.\n\nThis, however, is not so very remarkable, since the same method is common in greater or less degree to most proselytizers. But I remember on one occasion, during a discussion in which I was engaged with a learned B\u00e1b\u00ed at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, some point arose connected with the nature of the divinity which they attribute to B\u00e1b and Beh\u00e1, and manifestations of the Divine in general. One who was present was about to offer some further explanations when the chief speaker checked him, saying, \"han\u00faz pukht\u00e9 na-shud\u00e9 ast,\" \"He is not yet ripe.\" This remark naturally suggested to me the idea that the doctrine was only disclosed by degrees, as the mind of the enquirer was found prepared to receive it. A certain comparatively small class of B\u00e1b\u00eds, especially those drawn from the ranks of the S\u00faf\u00eds, simply regard the one essential inner doctrine of all prophets and saints in this and preceding \"manifestations\" as the oneness of the highest\nportion of the human soul with the Divine Essenee. Hence\nthe doctrine of the divinity of Beh\u00e1 to them presents no\ndifficulty at all, for they have their Man\u1e63\u00fars, their Juneyds,\nand their B\u00e1yaz\u00edds, each of whom claimed to be divine.\n\nTo these the prophet is merely the murshid, or spiritual\nguide, on a larger scale; and in either case the ultimate\noutcome of his teaching is to enable the murid, or disciple,\nto realize the same truth which he has attained to. B\u00e1bis\nof this class ought perhaps to be regarded merely as \u0160\u00faf\u00eds\nattracted by the prestige and influence of B\u00e1b or Beh\u00e1, but\nreally retaining their original beliefs almost or quite un-\nmodified, and, as it were, reading these into the doctrine to\nwhich they have attached themselves, rather than deriving\nthem from it. It was only at Kirm\u00e1n that I met with B\u00e1bis\nof this type, and when I repeated their views to some of the\ninfluential and learned B\u00e1bis of Yezd, they unhesitatingly\nand strongly condemned them; and the following passage\nfrom the Lauck-i-Akdas (of which I spoke in my last paper\nas the most concise and authoritative r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the B\u00e1b\u00ed\ndoctrine of the present day) is clearly intended to discourage\nall such mystical speculation, and render impossible that\nmethod of allegorical interpretation which the \u0160\u00faf\u00eds have so\nfreely applied to the Kur\u2019\u00e1n:\n\n\"Wa minhun man yadda\u2018i l-b\u00e1tina, wa b\u00e1tina\u2018l-b\u00e1tini; kul,\n\u2018Y\u00e1 ayyuhu\u2018l-kadhdh\u00e1b! Ta\u2019ll\u00e1hi, m\u00e1 \u2018indaka innahu\nmina\u2018l-ku\u0161hiri, tarakn\u00e1-h\u00e1 lakum kem\u00e1 tutraku\u2018l-\n\u2018idh\u00e1mu li\u2018l-kil\u00e1b!\u2019\"\n\n\"And there are those amongst them who lay claim to the\ninner and the inmost (mystery). Say, 'O liar! By God,\nwhat thou hast is but husks which we have abandoned\nto you as bones are abandoned to the dogs!'\n\nA few lines further on we find the following verse:\n\n\"Man yadda\u2018i amran \u1e0dabla itm\u00e1mi alfi sanatin k\u00e1milatin,\ninnahu kadhdh\u00e1bun muftarin. . . . Man yu\u2018awwil\nh\u00e1dhih\u2018l-\u00e1yata, aw yufassir-h\u00e1 bi-ghayri m\u00e1 nuzzila\nfi\u2018dh-dh\u00e1hiri, innahu ma\u1e25r\u00famun min ru\u1e25i\u2019ll\u00e1hi wa\nralmatih\u2018llati sabakati\u2018l-\u2018\u00e1lamin.\"\n\"Whosoever claims a mission (lit. matter) before the completion of a full thousand years, is in truth a lying impostor. . . . Whosoever shall interpret this verse, or explain it otherwise than it has been revealed obviously, is indeed deprived of the Spirit of God, and His mercy which preceded the worlds.\"\n\nFrom this digression I now return to a consideration of the school of thought in which the B\u00e1b was reared, previously to his declaration of his divine mission.\n\nIn the early part of the present century of our era, probably (for I have not yet been able to ascertain the date accurately), there lived and taught in Persia a certain Sheykh Ahmad Ahs\u00e1\u2019\u00ed, who, though accounted unorthodox by the majority of the \u2018Ulem\u00e1, nevertheless attracted a number of disciples. On his death, H\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid K\u00e1zim of Resht was accepted as his successor by the latter, and for some years continued to lecture at Kerbel\u00e1 to all who, either by reason of faith in him or the departed Sheykh, or from mere curiosity, chose to come to him. Amongst the number of his disciples were M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad, the B\u00e1b (then only a youth of some seventeen or eighteen years of age), and a number of those who subsequently took a prominent part in the B\u00e1bi movement, such as Mull\u00e1 Huseyn of Bushraweyh, Mull\u00e1 Muhammad \u2018Al\u00ed B\u00e1lfur\u00fash\u00ed, \u00c1k\u00e1 Seyyid Huseyn of Yezd, and many others whose names are chronicled in the B\u00e1bi history of which I formerly spoke. During the last days of his life, H\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid K\u00e1zim spoke much of the approaching advent of the K\u00e1\u2019\u00edm, or Im\u00e1m Mahd\u00ed, but would not describe the signs whereby he should be known, further than by stating that he would be a youth, not trained in the learning of the schools, and of the race of H\u00e1shim. Though warned of his approaching death by the interpretation of a dream concerning himself, which was\n\n1 Since writing the above, I have received from one of my friends in Persia short biographies both of Sheykh Ahmad and of Seyyid K\u00e1zim. The former was born A.H. 1166 (A.D. 1752\u201353), and died A.H. 1242 (A.D. 1826\u201327). The latter died A.H. 1259 (A.D. 1843\u201344), being at that time not more than fifty years of age.\n\n2 See Appendix I.\nrelated to him by an Arab, he did not nominate any one to succeed him, so that, when he died, his disciples were left in doubt as to whom they should choose to take their master's place. An interesting account is given by the author of the B\u00e1b\u00ed history, on the authority of witnesses then living, of how these latter assembled in the mosque at K\u00fafa to fast and pray, seeking for divine guidance in the matter of the choice of a successor. Lack of space prevents me from giving these particulars in further detail here: I will confine myself to the statement that two claimants arose for the vacant leadership. These were our hero, M\u00edrz\u00e1 'Al\u00ed Muhammad the B\u00e1b, and H\u00e1j\u00ed Muhammad Kar\u00edm Kh\u00e1n of Kirm\u00e1n, whose followers still exist in considerable numbers under the name of Sheykhis. They are thus called after Sheykh Ahmad A\u1e25s\u00e1'\u00ed, from whose teaching their doctrines, like those of the B\u00e1b\u00eds, were derived. The majority of the early Sheykhis accepted the B\u00e1b, and forthwith became known as B\u00e1b\u00eds, while only such of them as refused to admit his claim, and followed H\u00e1j\u00ed Muhammad Kar\u00edm Kh\u00e1n, retained the title of Sheykhis. Between these two sects the most extreme hostility exists.\n\nHaving now described the antecedents and relations of B\u00e1b\u00edsm, so far as appears necessary for my present purpose, I shall proceed to discuss the literature which must be examined in order to arrive at a satisfactory knowledge of its development. This I shall classify chronologically, both to facilitate reference, and also to aid in bringing about a clearer comprehension of the subject. All those works to which I have had access I have described as fully as the space at my disposal would admit of. In other cases I have been obliged to content myself with mentioning the names of works not accessible to me at present.\n\nBefore proceeding further, it is necessary to notice several published descriptions of B\u00e1b\u00ed MSS., of the existence of which I was unaware when I wrote my first paper.\n\nIn the Bulletin de l'Acad\u00e9mie Imp\u00e9riale des Sciences de St. P\u00e9tersbourg for 1864\u201365 (vol. viii. p. 247 et seq.), there is a notice by Dorn of a MS. of one of the B\u00e1b's works, wherein\nseveral pages of the original text are given. This work, called by Dorn \"the \u1e32ur\u2019\u00e1n of the B\u00e1b\u00eds,\"\u00b9 is probably one of the two Arabic Bey\u00e1ns, as pointed out by M. Huart.\u00b2 The interest of it is enhanced by the circumstances under which, according to Dorn, it was obtained: \"With regard to the authenticity of the MS.,\" he says, \"there can be no doubt, since it proceeds directly from the secretary of the B\u00e1b himself, who asserted that he had written it down at the dictation of his master. He had it conveyed into European hands from his prison at Tabr\u00edz. The responsibility for its contents rests, therefore, on the above-mentioned secretary.\"\n\nBaron Rosen has published two volumes entitled Collections Scientifiques de l\u2019Institut des Langues Orientales (de St. P\u00e9tersbourg), of which the first (Les Manuscrits Arabes de l\u2019Institut, etc.) appeared in 1877, and the second (Les Manuscrits Persans, etc.) in 1886. In the first of these volumes 33 pages are occupied with an admirable description and analysis, with copious extracts from the original, of two B\u00e1b\u00ed MSS. The first of these appears to be the B\u00e1b\u2019s Commentary on the S\u00fara-i-Y\u00fasuf (see below, pp. 904\u2013909); the second contains letters written by one of the B\u00e1b\u00ed chiefs subsequently to the death of the B\u00e1b, the longest of which, addressed collectively to the kings and rulers of different countries, is altogether different from Beh\u00e1\u2019s \u201cLetters to the Kings,\u201d which I shall describe later (see below, pp. 954\u2013958). The second volume of Baron Rosen\u2019s work contains also a description of two B\u00e1b\u00ed MSS. occupying 50 pages. Of these, the first appears to be the Persian Bey\u00e1n written by the B\u00e1b himself; while the second is the \u1e24ik\u00e1m composed by Beh\u00e1. Of both these books I possess copies, and others exist in the British Museum, and I have satisfied myself by careful comparison of their identity.\n\nLastly, in the Journal Asiatique for 1887 (8th series, vol. x.), M. Cl\u00e9ment Huart has published a description of three B\u00e1b\u00ed MSS. which apparently consist chiefly, if not entirely, of the writings of M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1, \u0160uhb\u00ed (or \u1e24azrat)-i-Ezel.\n\n\u00b9 See below, p. 940, and note.\n\u00b2 Journal Asiatique, 1887, viii. s\u00e9rie, vol. x.\nThis notice supplies a very great want, the Ezeli writings being rare and difficult to obtain, and I shall notice it more fully in its proper place (see below, p. 940 et seq.).\n\nTo proceed with the classification of the literature bearing on the B\u00e1b\u00ed doctrines, I shall divide it into four periods, as follows:\n\nI. The writings of the teacher of the B\u00e1b, H\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid K\u00e1zim of Resht, and of his teacher, Sheyk Ahmad Alh\u00e1d\u00ed. These I shall henceforth denominate as Pre-B\u00e1b\u00ed writings.\n\nII. The writings of M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad the B\u00e1b himself, which probably extend over a period of seven years, the earliest (the Ziy\u00e1rat-nam\u00e9) being apparently written before he announced his divine mission, and the latest (probably the Persian Bey\u00e1n) having occupied him until his martyrdom at Tabr\u00edz on July 9th, 1850. To this period also belong sundry other B\u00e1b\u00ed writings, especially the poems of the unfortunate and talented Kurratu\u2019l-\u2018Ayn.\n\nIII. The writings of what I may call \u201cthe Interval,\u201d i.e. from the death of the B\u00e1b until the exile of the B\u00e1b\u00eds from Baghdad to Constantinople and Adrianople, at the former of which places they only remained four months according to Nab\u00edl, arriving at the latter in the month of Rajab, A.H. 1281 (December, 1864). This period therefore embraces about fourteen years and a half, during the whole of which M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1\u00b9 (Hazrat-i-Ezel) was the nominal head of the sect, and vicegerent of the B\u00e1b, although even then Beh\u00e1 (M\u00edrz\u00e1 Huseyn \u2018Al\u00ed, M\u00e1zandar\u00e1n\u00ed), who, according to the accounts which I received from the B\u00e1b\u00eds, was M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1\u2019s half-brother, and older than him by some years, actually took the most prominent part in the organization of affairs.\n\nIV. The fourth period begins with the claim of Beh\u00e1 to be\n\n\u00b9 According to Gobineau (loc. cit. p. 277) M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1 was the son of M\u00edrz\u00e1 Buzurg N\u00far\u00ed, Vaz\u00edr of Im\u00e1m-Verdi M\u00edrz\u00e1, governor of Teher\u00e1n, and lost his mother at his birth. He was then adopted by the wife of Beh\u00e1. This would make him the adopted son instead of the half-brother of Beh\u00e1. The following is \u0160uhb-i-Ezel\u2019s own statement made (in part directly, in part through his son, to Captain Young, Commissioner at Famagusta, Cyprus, who kindly communicated to me the result of his inquiries: \u201cMy name is M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1. I was born in Teher\u00e1n. My father, who was second to the Grand Vaz\u00edr of Persia, was named \u2018Abb\u00e1s, but was better known as M\u00edrz\u00e1 Buzurg. Beh\u00e1 is my step brother. We are of one father by different mothers. He is my elder by 13 years.\u201d (See Appendix II. \u00a7 2.)\n\"He whom God shall manifest,\" and his consequent demand that all the B\u00e1b\u00eds, including M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1, hitherto nominal head of the sect, should yield him allegiance. The date of this claim is fixed by Nabil as A.H. 1283 (A.D. 1866-67). The schism resulting therefrom I spoke of in my former paper. Dissension waxed fierce amongst the two parties, and finally several on either side were killed. The Turkish government decided to separate them, and M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1 and his adherents were sent to Cyprus, while Beh\u00e1 and his followers were removed to Acre, where they arrived on the 12th of Jem\u00e1di\u2019ul-Avval, A.H. 1285 (August 29th, 1868). This period extends down to the present day. The literature of the sect now becomes divided into that of Beh\u00e1 and his followers, and that of M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1 and his partizans. I regret to say that of the latter I do not possess any examples, and in discussing it I shall have to rely entirely on M. Huart\u2019s notice.\n\nI shall now proceed to examine each of these four periods in greater detail.\n\nFirst Period. Doctrines of Sheyk\u0324h Ah\u0331mad Ah\u0331s\u00e1\u2019\u00ed and his successor H\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid K\u00e1zim of Resht, the Teacher of the B\u00e1b.\n\nThe materials for an investigation of the above are copious, since both Sheyk\u0324h Ah\u0331mad and H\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid K\u00e1zim were prolific writers, and their works, which are greatly esteemed by the Sheyk\u0324his of the present day, abound.\n\nThe chief of those composed by the former are as follows: Shar\u1e25-i-Fav\u0101\u2019id, both text and commentary by the same author, and both in Arabic; Shar\u1e25-i-Zig\u00e1rat-i-J\u00e1mi\u2019a (4 vols.); Shar\u1e25-i-\u2018Arshiyya, a commentary on the \u2018Arshiyya of Mull\u00e1 Sadr\u00e1; Ajwibatu\u2019l-Mas\u00e1\u2019il; Shar\u1e25-i-Mash\u00e1\u2019ir-i-Mull\u00e1 Sadr\u00e1; Shar\u1e25-i-Tab\u1e63ira-i-\u2018All\u00e1ma; Jaw\u00e1ni\u2019ul-Kalam, etc.\n\nH\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid K\u00e1zim of Resht composed, amongst other works, a commentary on the Khulb\u00e9-i-Tatunjiyy\u00e9, and the Shar\u1e25-i-Ka\u1e63ida.\n\nTo form a proper estimate of the influence of these writers and their doctrines on the B\u00e1b, and of the extent to which\nthe germ of the doctrine of the latter is contained in them, a careful study of all these works would be necessary. This I have not yet been able to accomplish. Fortunately a general r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the chief characteristics of their doctrine is contained in a work called the Ki\u1e63\u0101\u1e63u'l-'Ulam\u0101', by Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Suleym\u0101n, Tunuk\u00e1bun\u012b (2nd edition, Teher\u0101n, A.H. 1304). This book contains an account of the chief Sh\u012b'ite divines of recent times, and the second article, which treats of the life and works of H\u00e1j\u00ed Mull\u00e1 Mu\u1e25ammad Tak\u00ed at considerable length, deals incidentally with the doctrines of both the Sheykhs and the B\u00e1b\u00eds. H\u00e1j\u00ed Mull\u00e1 Mu\u1e25ammad Tak\u00ed of Kazv\u00edn was, as mentioned by Gobineau, the uncle and father-in-law of Kurratu'l-'Ayn, the B\u00e1b\u00ed heroine. He had always disliked Sheyk\u1e25 Ahmd A\u1e25s\u00e1'\u00ed and his followers, denouncing them as heretics; he had held disputations at Kazv\u00edn with the Sheyk\u1e25 himself concerning the doctrine of the resurrection of the body, and finally so prejudiced the inhabitants of that town against him that he was compelled to depart thence. When the B\u00e1b's doctrines began to spread themselves through Persia, Mull\u00e1 Mu\u1e25ammad Tak\u00ed's hatred was increased, and reached its climax when his niece and daughter-in-law Kurratu'l-'Ayn, then called Zarrin T\u0101j, not only embraced these doctrines, and put herself in communication with the B\u00e1b, but began openly to preach them, to the great scandal of all pious Mu\u1e25ammadans. H\u00e1j\u00ed Mull\u00e1 Mu\u1e25ammad Tak\u00ed publicly cursed Sheyk\u1e25 Ahmd A\u1e25s\u00e1'\u00ed. For this act he paid with his life, for he was stabbed in the mosque at Kazv\u00edn by M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u0160\u00e1l\u012bh of Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, and two or three other B\u00e1b\u00eds. It was alleged by the enemies of Kurratu'l-'Ayn that she was a party to this assassination. Of this there is no proof, and had there been such, we may be sure that she would have scarcely escaped the vengeance of the Mu\u1e25ammadans. As it was, she quitted Kazv\u00edn and proceeded to M\u00e1zandar\u00e1n, where she met Mull\u00e1 \u1e24useyn of Bushraweyh, and H\u00e1j\u00ed Mull\u00e1 Mu\u1e25ammad 'Al\u00ed of B\u00e1lfur\u00fash, with whom she remained until a short time before\n\n1 According to the Ki\u1e63\u0101\u1e63u'l-'Ulam\u0101', this took place in A.H. 1264 (A.D. 1848).\nthey entrenched themselves, with their followers, in the Tomb of Sheykh Tabarsi. She was ultimately arrested, and suffered death in August, 1852.\n\nIt is on account of this fatal enmity, which H\u00e1j\u00ed Mull\u00e1 Muhammad Tak\u00ed entertained towards Sheykh Ahmad A\u1e25s\u00e1\u2019\u00ed, that his biographer treats at some length of the doctrines of the latter and his followers, which he likewise regards as heretical and objectionable.\n\nFrom his statements, it appears that Sheykh A\u1e25mad tried to combine theology with philosophy, and to reconcile dogma with reason. The result of this attempt, according to our author, was to satisfy neither theologians nor philosophers, the former disliking him as unsound, the latter despising him as illogical. Nevertheless he had numerous admirers, including Fat\u1e25 \u2018Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h, who was then reigning. His followers were called after him Sheykhis. When M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad the B\u00e1b put forward his doctrine, many of the latter embraced it, and became B\u00e1bis. The Sheykhis of the present day are, as before stated, those who consider H\u00e1j\u00ed Muhammad Kar\u00edm Kh\u00e1n of Kirm\u00e1n as the successor of Haj\u00ed Seyyid K\u00e1zim of Resht, who was the successor of the Sheykh himself, and the common teacher of both H\u00e1j\u00ed Muhammad Kar\u00edm Kh\u00e1n and M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad, the B\u00e1b.\n\nBriefly, the chief peculiarities of Sheykh A\u1e25mad\u2019s views seem to have been as follows. He declared that all knowledge and all sciences were contained in the Kur\u2019\u00e1n, and that therefore to understand the inner meanings of the latter in their entirety, a knowledge of the former must be acquired. To develop this doctrine, he used to apply cabalistic methods of interpretation to the sacred text, and exerted himself to acquire familiarity with the various sciences known to the Muslim world.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 It is worth remarking that H\u00e1j\u00ed Muhammad Kar\u00edm Kh\u00e1n, the Sheykhi, in his work entitled Irsh\u00e1d\u00edl l-\u2018Awd\u00e1n\u00ed (\u201cThe Direction of the Common People\u201d), similarly laid claim to a knowledge of the whole range of sciences. For this presumption, as well as that implied in the title of the book in question, he is severely censured both by the Muhammadans and the B\u00e1bis. Beh\u00e1, in the Ikt\u00e1, says that he declared in the above-mentioned book that the Ascension (mi\u2019r\u00e1j) of the Prophet could not be properly understood without a knowledge of some twenty sciences, including Alchemy, Philosophy, and Necromancy, and condemns him most strongly for thus making spiritual knowledge dependent on such sciences.\nexaggerated veneration for the Im\u00e1ms, especially the Im\u00e1m Ja'far-i-S\u00e1d\u00edk, the sixth of them in succession, whose words he would often quote. He wrote a treatise in which he asserted that in reciting the S\u00faratu'l-F\u00e1t\u00edha of the Kur'\u00e1n, at the words \"Iyy\u00e1ka na'budu\" (\"thee do we worship\"), the worshipper should fix his thoughts on 'Al\u00ed, and intend him (\"Amiru'l-M\u00faminin-r\u00e1 ka\u015fl kunad\"). He further asserted that the Im\u00e1ms were creative powers, and the agents (vakil) of God in His government of the world; in support of this doctrine he adduced texts from the Kur'\u00e1n, where God is called \"the Best of Creators,\" and likewise quoted a traditional saying of 'Al\u00ed's, \"Ana Kh\u00e1liku's-sam\u00e1wati wa'l-ar\u1e0dh,\" \"I am the creator of the heavens and the earth,\" for the same purpose. He used to live an austere life, believing that in his dreams he held converse with the Im\u00e1ms, and received instruction from them. About the future life, and the resurrection of the body also, he held views which were generally considered to be heterodox, as previously mentioned. He declared that the body of man was composed of different portions, derived from each of the four elements and the nine heavens, and that the body wherewith he was raised in the resurrection contained only the latter components, the former returning at death to their original sources. This subtle body, which alone escaped destruction, he called Jism-i-Huicarkily\u00e1, the latter being supposed to be a Greek word. He asserted that it existed potentially in our present bodies, \"like glass in stone.\" Similarly he asserted that, in the ease of the Night-aseent of the Prophet to Heaven, it was this, and not his material body which performed the journey. On account of these views, he was pronounced unorthodox by the majority of the 'Ulam\u00e1, and accused of holding the doctrines of Mull\u00e1 Sadr\u00e1, the greatest Persian philosopher of modern times. This he denied, and even pronounced Mull\u00e1 Sadr\u00e1, and his follower, Mull\u00e1 Mu\u1e25sin-i-Fay\u017c, to be heretics, but he failed thereby to establish his own orthodoxy in the eyes of the clergy.\n\nSuch, in brief, were the doctrines of Sheykh Ahmad A\u1e25s\u00e1'\u00ed; and his pupil and successor, H\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid K\u00e1z\u00edm of\nResht, appears to have held and taught essentially the same views\u2014which, for the rest, are, I believe, substantially the same as those held by the Sheykhis of the present day.\n\nIn them also I think we can discern the germs of the doctrines of the B\u00e1b, although the latter rapidly developed far beyond this point. As these only concern us at present, it is unnecessary to examine further the Sheykhi theology. It is sufficient to note three points only of Sheyk Ahmad\u2019s teachings: his extreme veneration for the Im\u00e1ns, whom he regarded as the incarnate Attributes of God; his belief that he enjoyed spiritual communion with them, and received instruction from them; and his denial of a material resurrection, at any rate in the full sense in which it is generally held by the Muhammadan theologians.\n\nSecond Period. Development of the Doctrines of M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Mu\u1e25ammad the B\u00e1b.\n\nWe now come to the second of the four periods which I have indicated above, viz. the doctrines of M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Mu\u1e25ammad the B\u00e1b, and their gradual development. Here again the materials for an examination are abundant, but copies of the books, which exist only in manuscript, are extremely rare. Gobineau\u00b9 states that his first writings were the Journal of his pilgrimage to Mecca, and a commentary on the S\u00fara-i-Y\u00fasuf, and then proceeds: \u201cIn 1848 he codified his prescriptions, so to speak, and collected them together in an Arabic book, which he entitled the Bey\u00e1n, \u2018Explanation,\u2019 that is to say, the setting forth and expounding of all which it was important to know. . . . The word Bey\u00e1n, once employed by the B\u00e1b, appeared to him to be very suitable to designate the sphere of ideas in which his thoughts moved, and thenceforth he applied it as a title to all which he composed.\u201d Here also M. le Comte de Gobineau displays his usual acumen and profound research. In the Persian Bey\u00e1n (V\u00e1hid iii. chapter 17) the B\u00e1b says, \u201cAll the writings of the Point (Nukta) are called Bey\u00e1n, though\n\n\u00b9 Religions et Philosophies dans l\u2019Asie Centrale, p. 311.\nin the original reality this term is confined to verses\u201d (i.e. Arabic verses, like those of the Kur\u2019\u00e1n, \u00e1y\u00e1t).\n\nIn other passages of the same work the B\u00e1b divides all his writings into five classes, viz. Verses (\u00e1y\u00e1t), Prayers (mun\u00e1j\u00e1t), Commentaries (taf\u00e1s\u00edr), Scientific treatises (shu\u2019\u00fan-i-\u2018ilm\u00edyy\u00e9), and Persian writings (kal\u00edm\u00e1t-i-f\u00e1rs\u00edyy\u00e9), and expressly states that although the term Bey\u00e1n is properly applicable only to the first, it includes them all in a certain sense. After the mention of this first Arabic Bey\u00e1n, M. le Comte de Gobineau continues, \u201cOne must especially notice amongst them (i.e. the B\u00e1b\u2019s works) a Bey\u00e1n written in Persian, which is not the commentary of the first Bey\u00e1n written in Arabic, for it in no wise seeks to elucidate the difficulties of the latter. . . Besides the two Bey\u00e1ns which I have just mentioned there is also a third, similarly composed by the first B\u00e1b. Without being either more difficult or more easy to understand than the two others, it sums up their contents in a comparatively short form. The translation of this catechism will be found at the end of the book.\u201d\u00b9\n\nFive works of the B\u00e1b\u2019s own composition are therefore enumerated by Gobineau, viz. three Bey\u00e1ns (two of these in Arabic and one in Persian), the Commentary on the S\u00fara-i-Y\u00fasuf, and the so-called \u201cJournal of the Pilgrimage.\u201d This is not intended to include them all, for the learned author adds, speaking of the works of the B\u00e1b, \u201cthey were sufficiently numerous considering his age and the shortness of his life.\u201d Of several others we have mention made in the B\u00e1b\u00ed history of which I spoke in my last paper. Thus we read of a Commentary on the S\u00fara-i-Ka\u0144thar written at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z for Ak\u00e1 Seyyid Yahy\u00e1 of D\u00e1r\u00e1b, and a Commentary on the S\u00fara beginning \u201cWa\u2019l-\u2018Asr,\u201d written at Isfah\u00e1n for the Im\u00e1m Jum\u2019a of that city, as well as a Treatise on the Prophetic Mission of Muhammad (Nubuvvat-i-Kh\u00fa\u1e63\u0161\u00e9) written for Min\u00fachihr Kh\u00e1n, Mu\u2019tamadu\u2019d-Dawlah, then Governor of Isfah\u00e1n; while many more of his works must have perished during the long persecution of the B\u00e1bis, and others, doubtless, still\n\n\u00b9 Gobineau, loc. cit. p. 312.\nremain hidden away amongst them. The B\u00e1b himself states in one passage of the Persian Bey\u00e1n that his writings comprise no less than 500,000 verses.\n\nWe must therefore limit our investigations to the five works enumerated by M. le Comte de Gobineau, and of these it will obviously be desirable to consider first of all the two earlier ones, viz. the Commentary on the S\u00fara-i-Y\u00fasuf, and the so-called Journal of the Pilgrimage.\n\nBefore proceeding to do so, however, let us glance once more at the circumstances of their author. Originally destined for commercial pursuits, our hero, M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad, had been sent at the age of fifteen or sixteen to Bushire to conduct his father\u2019s business there. From his childhood he seems to have been addicted to speculation and reverie, and we can hardly suppose that he found his employment at Bushire congenial. At any rate after a while he undertook the pilgrimage to Mecca, and remained for some time at Kerbel\u00e1 studying under H\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid K\u00e1zim. Even then he attracted considerable attention, favourable or unfavourable according to the disposition of those who came in contact with him. Let us again refer to the Ki\u0161a\u1e63u\u2019l-\u2018Ulam\u00e1, the author of which, while in Kerbel\u00e1, saw the B\u00e1b on sundry occasions. He writes thus: \u201cSeveral times I attended the lectures of H\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid K\u00e1zim. M\u00edr \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad also used to come to his lectures, and had with him pen and ink-stand, and whatever Seyyid K\u00e1zim said, of moist or dry, he used to write down in that same lecture. And he used to shave his beard, or cut it close to the roots with a scissors. The cause of his being known to the author of this book was this, that one day I was seated with a holy and just person at the head of the tomb of that Holy One (i.e. Huscyn), when we saw that same Seyyid (i.e. the B\u00e1b) enter. And he stood at the entrance of the holy place, and performed his visit (ziy\u00e1rat), and turned back from that same place. I asked of that holy person (i.e. my companion), \u2018Who is this person?\u2019 That holy one replied, \u2018This man is M\u00edr \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad of Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, and he is one of the pupils of H\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid K\u00e1zim.\u2019 I said, \u2018Why does this man perform his visit (ziy\u00e1rat) thus?\u2019\nThat person replied, 'For this reason, that he considers this manner more in accordance with respect.' I replied, 'This is a mistake, for visiting (the shrines) is an act of worship, and as we have been commanded, and our Im\u00e1ms have taught us, so should we perform the visitation; and they have ordained that we should go up to the side of the pure tomb, and should embrace the most pure tomb. But to stand afar off by way of (showing) respect is as though we were not to recite supererogatory prayers because we are unworthy to stand in the court of God.'\n\nA few lines further on the same author says: \"A certain individual relates, 'I was seated with a pious personage in the burial-place of the K\u00e1zimeyn\u00b2 (upon both of them be peace), when M\u00edr 'Al\u00ed Muhammad came up to the door of the burial-place. That pious person said, \"May God kill this Seyyid, and cause the time of his death to arrive!\" Then I said to that pious person, \"Why dost thou curse this person?\" That pious one said in reply, \"In a little while vain beliefs will appear from this person, and will rend the honour of the Musulm\u00e1ns, and be the cause of the shedding of their blood.\"'\n\nFrom the above extracts we learn that at this period, before he had put forward any claim, and while still attending the lectures of H\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid K\u00e1\u1e93im, the B\u00e1b had adopted the practice (unusual in his class in Persia) of shaving the chin, which he appears to have followed, not merely in a casual manner, as a simple matter of choice, but from a dislike to allowing the beard to grow, for we find that subsequently he commanded his followers to do the same.\u00b3 For the rest, he followed the practice of the Sheykh\u00eds in his method of visiting the shrines of the Im\u00e1ms, and from the\n\n\u00b9 This method of performing a visitation of the holy shrines at Kerbel\u00e1, etc., is one of the distinctive practices of the Sheykh\u00eds to this day. Hence they speak of other Shi'ite Muhammadans as \"B\u00e1lisaris,\" i.e. those who go up to, and embrace, the head of the tomb.\n\n\u00b2 The tombs of \"the two K\u00e1zims\" (i.e. the seventh Im\u00e1m, M\u00fas\u00e1 K\u00e1\u1e93im, and the ninth Im\u00e1m, Muhammad T\u00e1ki) are situated about three miles N. of Baghdad, and constitute one of the principal places of pilgrimage of the Shi'ites. Around them has grown up a considerable town, chiefly inhabited by Persians, known as K\u00e1zimeyn.\n\n\u00b3 See Gobineau, loc. cit. p. 353, and Persian Bey\u00e1n, V\u00e1hid viii. chapter 8.\nfrequency with which he appears to have done so, we may well imagine that he had imbibed from his teachers that extreme love and veneration of them which characterized the Sheykhi school.\n\nBearing in mind these facts, let us turn to examine the so-called \"Journal of the Pilgrimage,\" spoken of by Gobineau as one of the earliest writings of the B\u00e1b. Of its contents, no account is given by the learned Frenchman; he merely says that in this book the B\u00e1b was \"chiefly pious and mystic.\"\u00b9 A little further on, however, in speaking of the departure of Mull\u00e1 Huseyn from Sh\u00edr\u00e1z for \u2018Ir\u00e1k and Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, to preach the new doctrine, he says, \"In order not to appear, in the eyes of suspicious people, as an adventurer without rights, without evidences, and without proofs, he took with him the Narrative of the Pilgrimage and the Commentary on the S\u00fara of Joseph, which at that time composed the sum of the B\u00e1b\u00ed works.\"\n\nTurning to the account of the Musulm\u00e1n historian in the N\u00e1sikhu\u2019t-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh, we find the following account given of the same event: \"So when he (the B\u00e1b) had examined Mull\u00e1 Huseyn, by seeing and talking with him, and found that he was firm in his faith, he bade him journey to \u2018Ir\u00e1k and Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, and enter every city and village, and invite men to him. And he entrusted to him the Ziy\u00e1rat-n\u00e1m\u00e9, which he had composed for the visitation of the Commander of the Faithful (i.e. \u2018Ali), and he likewise gave to him the Commentary on the S\u00fara-i-Y\u00fasuf, which he had himself written, so that he might read it to his converts, and make the eloquence of the B\u00e1b in those words an argument for his perfections.\"\n\nThere can, I apprehend, be no manner of doubt that the \"Ziy\u00e1rat-n\u00e1m\u00e9\" spoken of here, and the \"Narrative of the Pilgrimage\" mentioned by Gobineau, are one and the same work. Now the latter translation of the word Ziy\u00e1rat-n\u00e1m\u00e9 appears to me somewhat misleading. It might, no doubt, mean \"Book of the Pilgrimage,\" in the sense of \"Narrative\n\n\u00b9 loc. cit. p. 147.\nof the Pilgrimage\"; but it has another, and I think a commoner meaning, viz. a book of prayers to be used on performing a ziy\u00e1rat, or visitation, to the tombs of the Im\u00e1ms, or other saints. And from the words of the Persian historian, \"which he had composed for the visitation of the Commander of the Faithful\" (i.e. 'Ali), I think we can have no doubt that it is used in this latter sense, and that it is such a book of prayers which we must look for as representing the earliest composition of the B\u00e1b.\n\nNow, while I was at Kirm\u00e1n, one of my B\u00e1b\u00ed friends there one day showed me a MS. scroll, and informed me that it was the Ziy\u00e1rat-n\u00e1m\u00e9 of \"\u1e24azrat-i-Nukta-i-U\u1e6dl\u00e1\" (i.e. the B\u00e1b). I had not made any enquiries for this work, of which, indeed, I had forgotten the existence, so that the communication was quite spontaneous. Of this I obtained a copy, which is now in my possession, and I have no doubt that this is the work spoken of by Gobineau and the Persian historian. The style of the B\u00e1b's writings is too remarkable to be easily mistaken, and the same peculiarities are found in this as in the Persian Bey\u00e1n.\n\nLet us go a step further. M\u00edrz\u00e1 K\u00e1zem Beg, in his article on \"B\u00e1b and the B\u00e1bis\" in the Journal Asiatique, describes a small manuscript which had been procured for him by M. Melnikoff, who had acquired it, along with some B\u00e1b\u00ed talismans, in Teher\u00e1n. Concerning the manuscript he says that it \"consists of twenty-seven pages of the size of a sheet (of paper) folded in four, written in Arabic, and containing instructions on the ceremonial to be observed by every B\u00e1b\u00ed who has to present himself to one of the masters of his doctrine, either during a journey or at the threshold of his dwelling, and when he appears before him.\"\n\nNow I believe that M\u00edrz\u00e1 Kazem Beg was mistaken in thinking that this was the use for which the prayers in this volume were intended, and I am almost certain that the manuscript of which he speaks was none other than this Ziy\u00e1rat-n\u00e1m\u00e9 of the B\u00e1b which we are now considering.\n\nLet us verify this conclusion by seeing whether we can\n\n1 Journal Asiatique, 6e s\u00e9rie, tome viii. 1866, pp. 498-502.\nfind in the text of the Ziy\u00e1rat-n\u00e1m\u00e9 obtained by me in Kirm\u00e1n any passages which correspond in meaning with the translated specimens of M\u00edrz\u00e1 Kazem Beg.\n\nHis first specimen runs thus: \"La premi\u00e8re essence qui a re\u00e7u la beaut\u00e9 de la forme s'est lev\u00e9e, a brill\u00e9 et a communiqu\u00e9 au monde la lumi\u00e8re \u00e9manant de la sph\u00e8re du s\u00e9jour de l'Eternel, et cette essence \u00e9tait la v\u00f4tre.\" Searching through the Ziy\u00e1rat-n\u00e1m\u00e9 I find, just as M\u00edrz\u00e1 Kazem Beg says, \"at the beginning of the prayer addressed to the 'friend of God,'\u201d the following passage:\n\n\"Awwalu jautharin \u1e6durriza wa ashraka, thumma \u1e6dala'a wa l\u00e1\u1e25a min sa\u1e25ati \u1e0durbi ha\u1e0dhrati'l-ezel 'alaykum. . . .\" This I should translate, \"The first substance was formed and shone forth, (and) then arose and gleamed from the court of the Presence of the Eternal upon you. . . .\" Neither the Arabic text nor my translation is identical in meaning with Kazem Beg's rendering, but the resemblance is sufficiently striking to make it in the highest degree probable that he had in view the same passage. However, let us take his second specimen, which runs thus: \"N'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 vous, rien (personne) n'aurait connu All\u00e1h; n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 vous, rien n'aurait honor\u00e9 All\u00e1h; n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 vous, rien n'aurait glorifi\u00e9 All\u00e1h!\" Two pages further on in my text I find the following passage:\n\n\"Fa lawl\u00e1kum, lam ya'rifi'll\u00e1ha shey'un; wa lawl\u00e1kum, lam ya'budi'll\u00e1ha shey'un; wa lawl\u00e1kum lam yukaddisi'll\u00e1ha shey'un. . . .\" This I translate, \"And were it not for you, nothing would have known God; and were it not for you, nothing would have worshipped God; and were it not for you, nothing would have glorified God.\" Here, at least, I think there can be no doubt of the identity of my text and M\u00edrz\u00e1 Kazem Beg's translated specimen.\n\nTo establish the matter beyond all reasonable doubt, however, let us take his third specimen, which runs thus: \"All\u00e1h vous a consolid\u00e9 sur son tr\u00f4ne; il vous a donn\u00e9 son verbe; il vous a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 pour distribuer \u00e0 chacun le lot (sort) qui lui est destin\u00e9; il vous a \u00e9lu pour transmettre leur destin \u00e0 tous ceux qui sont soumis \u00e0 la Providence, etc.\" This, I have no doubt, represents the following passage:\n\"Kad ja'alakum masta'kivina 'ala 'arshihi, wa'n-natikina min 'indih\u00ee, wa'l-mu'tina ila kulli dh\u00ee hakkin hakkahu, wa'l-mubliqhina ila kulli dh\u00ee lukmin lukmahu. . .\" This I translate: \"He (God) hath made you to abide near His throne, and to speak on His part, and to give to every one who hath a claim his due, and to convey His decision to whomsoever needeth one.\"\n\nI think that I have now fairly proved that both the book which M\u00edrz\u00e1 Kazem Beg received from M. Melnikoff, and the \"Journal (or Narrative) of the Pilgrimage\" spoken of by M. le Comte de Gobineau, are identical with one another, and also with the B\u00e1bi Ziy\u00e1rat-n\u00e1m\u00e9 obtained by me in Kirm\u00e1n.\n\nI have discussed this point at considerable length because, from an examination of the B\u00e1bi MSS. in the British Museum, and in the catalogues of the Institut des Langues Orientales at St. Petersburg, I am convinced that a great difficulty in identifying B\u00e1bi MSS. exists, and is one of the chief barriers to a study of them and the doctrines they embody.\n\nHaving now, as I hope, sufficiently established the identity of this, apparently the earliest of the B\u00e1b's writings, it is necessary to examine briefly its contents. It appears to be rightly described by the Muhammadan historian as consisting of instructions and prayers for visiting the shrines of the Im\u00e1ms. After a short invocation addressed to God it begins: \"When thou wishest to visit the Friend of God, or one of the Im\u00e1ms of the Faith, first purify thy body from everything which thy heart dislikes; then wash thyself with seven handfuls of water upon the head, then with four handfuls upon the right (side), then with three handfuls upon the left (side). And when thou hast ceased (therefrom), put on thy best garments, and make use of perfume;\u00b9 then sit facing the Ka'ba, and ask pardon of God thy Lord twelve times.\n\n\u00b9 The use of perfume, and especially rose-water, is strongly recommended both by the B\u00e1b (Persian Bey\u00e1n, vi. 2, etc.) and Beh\u00e1 (see below, p. 977). The B\u00e1bis often use rose-water to wash their faces, and frequently keep otto of roses amongst their sacred books. Some of the B\u00e1bi books which were not written expressly for me, but were given to me by their owners, still preserve this perfume.\nThen walk with dignity and gravity, and magnify\\(^1\\) God on thy way, until thou reachest the gate of the sacred enclosure (b\u0101bul-haram). There pause, and magnify God thy Lord twelve times. Then enter, without uttering a single word, and walk with gravity until thou reachest unto (a distance of) seven paces below the foot (of the tomb). There stand, and say . . . .\n\nAfter this follows the prayer to be used, which occupies the rest of the work.\n\nNow of this introduction I will only remark two things. Firstly, we find enjoined the method of performing the ziy\u0101rat observed by the disciples of Sheykh Ahmad, and H\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid K\u00e1zim, alluded to by the author of the Kis\u0101\u1e63u-l-\u2018Ulam\u00e1 as having first attracted his attention to the B\u00e1b. Secondly, we see the germs of the B\u00e1b\u2019s own ideas, subsequently much more fully elaborated, of the desirability of using perfume and wearing fine raiment. In his later works he not only sanctions but ordains the use of silk, gold and silver ornaments, etc., which are condemned by Isl\u00e1m. This remark applies to the whole of the work in question. In the main, it reflects the doctrines of the B\u00e1b\u2019s masters, but an undercurrent of new ideas, still hardly defined, is discernible in places.\n\nIt would be beyond the scope of the present paper to attempt any detailed analysis of the Ziy\u0101rat-n\u00e1m\u00e9; a brief summary of its most salient features is all that I can give at present. What chiefly strikes us is the utter humility of the speaker, and the diffidence with which he addresses himself to the Im\u00e1ms, whom he so exalts as to make them Effulgences of the Divine Glory, Manifestations of God, and Intercessors with Him for sinful men, though in this he only goes beyond the generality of Sh\u00ed\u2018ites in degree. \u201cHow shall I describe you,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen in truth description is ashamed before your visage? And how shall I praise you, when verily praise is abashed before your presence?\u201d He then goes on to say how, in spite of his unworthiness and their loftiness and holiness,\n\n\\(^1\\) By saying \u201cAll\u00e1hu akbar,\u201d \u201cGod is most great.\u201d\nhe dares to approach them in supplication, and offer them his praises, desiring only complete submission to them, and annihilation in them, although, when he remembers his imperfections and sins, his gladness ceases, and his joy is troubled, his limbs quake, and his skin creeps. \"With what language,\" he continues, \"shall I confess my faults? and with what regard shall I look upon my actions? By your glory! were any but you aware of what I had acquired (i.e. what sins were chargeable to me), he would not look towards me, and would fly from the terror of the justice of God with regard to me, but ye, notwithstanding the greatness of your state, and the loftiness of your rank, and the glory of your brightness, and the completeness of your proofs, have pardoned me, and concealed me, as though I had not committed any fault, nor wrought any wrong.\" Along with this self-humiliation we find a craving for closer communion with the Im\u00e1ms (such as we have seen Sheykh Ahmad A\u1e25s\u00e1\u2019\u00ed believed himself to possess), and occasionally an expressed longing for their return to earth. \"Where,\" he says, in another place, \"are the days of your empire, that I may struggle for you? and where are the days of your glory, that I may obtain the blessing of (beholding) your visage? and where are the days of your kingdom, that I may take revenge for you on your enemies? and where are the days of your manifestation, that I may be independent of all except you? and where are the days of the appearance of the signs of your lordship, that by your permission I may say to whatsoever I will 'Be!' and it shall become existent before you? and where are the days which God hath promised unto His servants for your return?\"\n\nThis work seems to me of the utmost interest and importance in tracing the gradual formation of the B\u00e1b's ideas, and, so far as I know, it is the sole record of this early period of his life, before he put forward any claim to divine inspiration. In spite of the faults of grammar and obscurities of style which mark this, along with all the other compositions of the B\u00e1b, there is something sublime and beautiful in the thought concealed beneath the somewhat uncouth phraseology. Here we behold, not the \"B\u00e1b,\" nor the \"Point of\nUtterance\u201d (\u2018\u1e24uzrat-i-Nuk\u1e6da-i-Bey\u00e1n\u2019), but M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad, the young enthusiast, the ardent disciple of H\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid K\u00e1zim.\n\nAnd now comes the first change. By dint of dwelling on these ideas, and concentrating all his thoughts on the Im\u00e1ms, the unseen dispensers of God\u2019s will, M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad becomes convinced that he enjoys the favour of a special communication with them. His teacher, H\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid K\u00e1zim, dies, and, as has been mentioned, his disciples are left in doubt as to who is to succeed him. Of the exact sequence of events it is difficult to judge, by reason of the difference which exists between the various accounts. According to the B\u00e1b\u00ed historian, Mull\u00e1 Huseyn of Bushraweyh (who afterwards played so prominent a part in the B\u00e1b\u00ed movement till his death at Sheyk Tabarsi early in A.D. 1849) went to Sh\u00edr\u00e1z from Kerbel\u00e1 to be cured of a palpitation of the heart from which he suffered. On arriving there, he enquired for the house of M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad, who had been his friend and fellow-student at Kerbel\u00e1, and finding his way there, knocked at the door, which was opened by the latter himself, who welcomed his old friend, and conducted him into the house. After the customary compliments and enquiries, M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad said: \u201cIs it not the case that you Sheykhis believe that it is necessary that after the death of the departed Seyyid some one should take his place? It is now five months since he died. After him, who is his successor?\u201d Mull\u00e1 Huseyn replied, \u201cWe have not yet recognized any one.\u201d M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad said, \u201cWhat sort of person must he be?\u201d After a little reflection, Mull\u00e1 Huseyn described the qualities and attributes which must be found in him. \u201cDo you behold those signs in me?\u201d asked the B\u00e1b. Mull\u00e1 Huseyn knew that M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad had only studied at Kerbel\u00e1 for about two months, and had not while there shown any signs of an unusual degree of knowledge, besides having received only a rudimentary education previously. He was therefore greatly astonished at the question, and replied, \u201cI see none of these signs in you.\u201d Shortly afterwards he finds a commentary on the\nS\u016bratu'l-Bak\u0101ra lying on a shelf, takes it up and reads a little, and is surprised at the new meanings which it discloses. He asks M\u012brz\u0101 'Al\u012b Muhammad, \"Whose book is this?\" but the latter only replies, \"A youthful tyro (j\u016br\u0101n\u012b t\u0101z\u00e9-k\u016br) has written it, and he shows forth exceeding knowledge and greatness.\"\n\nNext day they have another similar conversation, and the B\u00e1b again asks Mull\u00e1 Huseyn if he sees in him the signs of spiritual leadership. The latter marvels at the persistent way he returns to this point, and determines to convince him of his deficient learning by asking him some questions. To his amazement, these are answered with surprising readiness and clearness; nay, even his inward thoughts and doubts seem to be divined and answered by the B\u00e1b. He is astonished, yet unwilling to believe in this unlettered youth, whom he has always looked on as so inferior in knowledge to himself. Finally, however, he is convinced, and accepts the doctrine of the B\u00e1b with an earnestness and sincerity to which his subsequent deeds bear ample witness. Once convinced, Mull\u00e1 Huseyn does not rest idle. He hastens to inform his fellow-disciples, who are still in doubt as to whom they should choose as a successor to their late teacher; many of these come to Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, and after more or less hesitation accept the new creed. Thus was formed the first nucleus of the B\u00e1b\u00eds.\n\nThe above particulars are derived from the B\u00e1b\u00ed history, of which I obtained a MS. copy at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, and of which another copy exists in the Library of the British Museum, numbered Or. 2942. There are difficulties connected with this account, for, according to the N\u00e1sikhu't-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh, it was at K\u00fafa that M\u012brz\u0101 'Al\u012b Muhammad first put forward his claims, and Gobineau supports this statement (though he does not explicitly state that he began to preach openly till his return to Sh\u00edr\u00e1z); while in another part of this same B\u00e1b\u00ed history another account of the first beginnings of B\u00e1b\u00edism makes Med\u00edn\u00e1 the scene of the earliest disclosure of his doctrines. M\u012brz\u00e1 Kazem Beg follows the N\u00e1sikhu't-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh, but represents the B\u00e1b as revisiting Mecca after\nhe had gathered round him some disciples at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z. According to this account, which best explains the difficulties of the case, it was on his return to Sh\u00edr\u00e1z in A.H. 1260 (A.D. 1844) that the B\u00e1b was arrested by order of M\u00edrz\u00e1 Huseyn Kh\u00e1n, governor of F\u00e1rs, owing to the progress which the sect founded by him made under the active leadership of Mull\u00e1 Huseyn. This view, too, is not free from difficulties, since the B\u00e1b expressly fixes the date of the Zuh\u00far (by which I suppose is meant the time when he first became convinced of his divine mission) as the 5th of Jam\u00e1di-ul-U\u2019l\u00e1, A.H. 1260 (May 23rd, 1844), while, according to M\u00edrz\u00e1 Kazem Beg, it was in October of the same year that he was arrested and imprisoned at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z. It is evidently impossible that in the space of six months he could have come to Sh\u00edr\u00e1z from Kerbel\u00e1, gained adherents there, visited Mecca, and returned to Sh\u00edr\u00e1z; and it is equally impossible that he should have begun preaching any definite doctrine on his own account before the date of the Zuh\u00far which he himself gives very accurately in the Persian Bey\u00e1n.\n\nI cannot help thinking that M\u00edrz\u00e1 Kazem Beg has been misled by the somewhat proleptic account of the Persian historian, who, after stating that the \u201cmischief\u201d (fitn\u00e1) began in A.H. 1260, describes what follows up to the removal of the B\u00e1b to Isfah\u00e1n continuously, not recurring to the subject till he comes to speak of Kurratu\u2019l-\u2018Ayn, and thus certainly including in the account which he gives of the occurrences of the year A.H. 1260 events which took place subsequently to that date. This view is confirmed by the B\u00e1b\u00ed historian, who makes the arrest of the B\u00e1b at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z occur in Ramaz\u00e1n, A.H. 1261 (September, 1845). This gives us a year and a half between the Zuh\u00far and the B\u00e1b\u2019s first imprisonment, a space of time amply sufficient for the events described as having occurred in it.\n\nWe must now turn our attention to the Commentary on the S\u00fara-i-Y\u00fasuf, the second of the two books which Mull\u00e1 Huseyn carried with him on his missionary journey to \u2018Ir\u00e1k and Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n. This work is subsequent to the Zuh\u00far, and though much bolder in its dogma than the Ziy\u00e1rat-n\u00e1m\u00e9,\nwhich we have already considered, it is less so than the Persian Bey\u00e1n, which was composed at M\u00e1ku, and was apparently the ultimate expansion of the B\u00e1b\u2019s views.\n\nOf this \u201cCommentary of the S\u00fara-i-Y\u00fasuf\u201d (Tafs\u00edr-i-S\u00fara-i-Y\u00fasuf), as it is somewhat misleadingly called, I have not myself been able to obtain a copy; but a MS., which entirely answers to the description given of it, exists in the Library of the Institut des Langues Orientales at St. Petersburg, and is fully described, with copious extracts, by Baron Victor Rosen in his work which I have already quoted. Another MS. of what appears to be the same work exists in the Library of the British Museum, numbered Or. 3539. The notes which I have taken of this latter entirely correspond with Baron Rosen\u2019s description, even to the groups of mystical letters placed at the beginning of each portion of the Commentary. Concerning the St. Petersburg MS. Baron Rosen writes, \u201cAccording to M. le Comte de Gobineau, one of the first works composed by the B\u00e1b must have been \u2018a commentary on the s\u00fara of the Kur\u2019\u00e1n called Joseph.\u2019 It appears to me almost certain that our manuscript is an example of this work,\u201d and I think there can be little doubt that this is so. Since Baron Rosen has so well described the book in question, I will forbear to speak of it at length, merely referring those who are interested in the matter to his admirable account. Briefly, it consists of a number of chapters (111 in the St. Petersburg copy), at the head of each of which, except the first, stands a verse from the S\u00fara-i-Y\u00fasuf. This is followed by the so-called \u201ccommentary,\u201d which appears to have a very slight connection with the text. These chapters are, in the St. Petersburg copy, stated to be without title; but in the British Museum MS. most of them are headed after the fashion of the s\u00faras of the Kur\u2019\u00e1n. The earlier ones have a title, e.g. the first is called \u201cS\u00faratu\u2019l-Malak,\u201d the second \u201cS\u00faratu\u2019l-Ulam\u00e1,\u201d the third \u201cS\u00faratu\u2019l-Im\u00e1n,\u201d etc. On the right side of this is written \u201cSh\u00edr\u00e1ziyya\u201d (revealed at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z), while on the left is written the number of verses of which the chapter consists, which appears to be forty-two in all cases. The book is entirely in Arabic, and\nis obscure and ungrammatical, like the rest of the B\u00e1b's writings. It must have been composed between May, A.D. 1844, and December, 1845, and therefore stands midway between the Ziy\u00e1rat-n\u00e1m\u00e9 and the Persian Bey\u00e1n. In it a distinct claim to a divine mission is put forward. Thus, in the first chapter, it is written,\n\n\"All\u00e1hun kud \u1e32addara an yakhruja dh\u00e1lika'l-kit\u00e1bu fi taf-s\u00edri a\u1e25san'i'l-k\u00edsa\u0161i min 'inda Mu\u1e25ammadi 'bni 'l-\u1e24asan\u00ed 'bni 'Aliyyi'bni Mu\u1e25ammadi 'bni 'Aliyyi'bni M\u00fasa'bni Ja'fari'bni Mu\u1e25ammadi 'bni 'Aliyyi'bni 'l-Huseyni 'bni 'Aliyyi 'bni Ab\u00fa T\u00e1l\u00edbin 'al\u00e1 'abdihi, li-yak\u00fana \u1e25ujjata'll\u00e1hi min 'inda 'dh-dhikri 'al\u00e1 'l-'alam\u00edna bal\u00edgh\u00e1.\"\n\n\"God hath decreed that this book, in explanation of the 'best of stories' (i.e. the S\u00fara-i-Y\u00fasuf, which is so called), should come forth from Mu\u1e25ammad, son of Hasan, son of 'Al\u00ed, son of Mu\u1e25ammad, son of 'Al\u00ed, son of M\u00fasa, son of Ja'far, son of Mu\u1e25ammad, son of 'Al\u00ed, son of Huseyn, son of 'Al\u00ed, son of Ab\u00fa T\u00e1l\u00edb, unto his servant, that it may be the proof of God on the part of the Remembrance reaching the two worlds.\"\n\nIt is interesting to observe that the claim put forward at this period by M\u00edrz\u00e1 'Al\u00ed Mu\u1e25ammad is that he enjoys a special spiritual communion with the twelfth or absent Im\u00e1m (Im\u00e1m-i-Gh\u00e1'ib), whose return, as the Im\u00e1m Mahd\u00ed, the Sh\u00ed'ites are expecting. So far our author does not go much beyond Sheykhl Ahmd, who, as we have seen, claimed to receive instructions from the absent Im\u00e1ms. It is, I think, in this sense that M\u00edrz\u00e1 'Al\u00ed Mu\u1e25ammad at this period assumes the title of \"B\u00e1b,\" or \"Gate\"; he is the gate whereby men must approach the Im\u00e1m, and the channel whereby the latter reveals to them the true meaning of the Kur'\u00e1n. I do not think that he claimed to be the \"Gate of God\" (B\u00e1b\u00fa'll\u00e1h), as the Persian historian says in the N\u00e1sikhu't-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh. At all events it must be borne in mind\n\n---\n\n1 I think that by the \"Remembrance\" (dhikr) the B\u00e1b is meant. It has been suggested to me that by reading li-yak\u00fana \u1e25ujjatu'll\u00e1hi, etc., a different and perhaps a better sense is given to the latter part of the passage, viz. \"that the proof (or demonstration) of God may reach the two worlds on the part of the Remembrance.\" For a similar use of dhikr see Appendix II. \u00a7 2.\nthat at a later date he abandoned this title for a higher one, that of \"Nukta-i-U'l\u00e1\" (the first Point), or \"Nukta-i-Bey\u00e1n\" (the Point of Utterance, or Explanation; i.e. Revelation). Amongst those who did not embrace his doctrines, the title of B\u00e1b was still applied to him, and his followers thus received, and are still known by, the name of B\u00e1bis. The latter, however, never mention M\u00edrz\u00e1 'Al\u00ed Muhammad now as the B\u00e1b, but call him either \"Hazrat-i-A'l\u00e1\" (His Highness the Supreme), or \"Hazrat-i-Nukta-i-U'l\u00e1\" (His Highness the First Point), or \"Hazrat-i-Rabb'u'l-A'l\u00e1\" (His Highness my Lord the Supreme). Neither do they call themselves B\u00e1bis as a rule, but rather \"Ahlu'l-Boy\u00e1n,\" or \"Ahlu'l-Beh\u00e1,\" according to whether their sacred book is the Bey\u00e1n, or whether they are believers in Beh\u00e1. In the writings of the latter the term \"Mala'u'l-Bey\u00e1n\" or \"Ahlu'l-Bey\u00e1n\" (people of the Bey\u00e1n) often means those B\u00e1bis who do not accept Beh\u00e1 as \"He whom God shall manifest,\" i.e. the Ezel\u00eds, whom, as I have said, the Beh\u00e1'\u00eds detest.\n\nThere are a few other points which it is desirable to notice with regard to the \"Commentary on the S\u00fara-i-Y\u00fasuf.\" Outwardly, at least, the dictates of Isl\u00e1m seem to be in the main accepted, and the Kur'\u00e1n is not declared to be abrogated. Thus it is written, \"Whosoever denies Isl\u00e1m, God will not accept from him any of his actions in the Day of Resurrection.\" At the same time it is implied that a true knowledge of what Isl\u00e1m means is to be obtained only through the B\u00e1b: \"And verily God will not accept from any one any of his actions, save from him who comes to the B\u00e1b (Gate) by the B\u00e1b (Gate) adoring God the Eternal, commended on the part of the B\u00e1b.\"\n\nThe month of Ramaz\u00e1n is ordered to be kept as a fast, and no mention seems to be made of the new month of fasting, consisting of nineteen days, which was afterwards instituted.\n\nSmoking is forbidden absolutely. We know from the N\u00e1sikhu't-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh that the refusal of the earlier B\u00e1bis to\n\n1 In conversation Ash\u00e1b (Companions) and Ahb\u00e1b (Friends) are the terms generally used by the B\u00e1bis to denote their co-religionists.\nsmoke the kaly\u00e1n (water-pipe), so much in vogue in Persia, was regarded as one of their distinguishing marks. At Y\u00e1rjamand, for example, Mull\u00e1 Huseyn and some of his followers were invited to supper by one Ak\u00e1 Seyyid Muhammad, a Musulm\u00e1n; but when pipes and coffee were brought in, the former declared them unlawful, and a violent discussion ensued, which terminated in the host forcibly expelling his guests.\\(^1\\)\n\nDivorce appears to be forbidden,\\(^2\\) as well as the use of drugs to produce abortion. Marriage with unbelievers is prohibited until they believe.\n\nAlthough, so far, there is no great divergence from the precepts and doctrines of Isl\u00e1m, there are other passages of a different type, which suggest a considerable development of the B\u00e1b\u2019s ideas. In these he not only reprobates the \u2018Ulam\u00e1, and lays stress on his divine mission, but even distinguishes the believers in his book from the \u201cpeople of the K\u016br\u2019\u00e1n,\u201d thus at least implying that the former is a new revelation. Thus he says:\n\n\u201cO people of the earth! Give thanks to God, for verily we have delivered you from the doctors of doubt (\u2018Ulam\u00e1\u2019udh-dhann), and have caused you to attain unto the region of the blessed Sinai.\u201d\\(^3\\)\n\nAgain he says:\n\n\u201cAnd verily God hath made lawful the food of the people of the K\u016br\u2019\u00e1n to the people of this book, and verily we have made lawful the food of the people of the book (Jews and Christians?) unto them.\u201d\n\nOf himself he speaks often, but in various, and often very enigmatical ways. Thus in one place he calls himself \u201cThis well-favoured Arabian youth, in whose grasp God hath placed the kingdom of the heavens and the earth;\u201d in another he says, \u201cO people of the earth! hear the voice of your Lord,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. Gobineau, op. cit. p 303, and Kremer\u2019s Herrschenden Ideen des Islams, p. 212. The latter believes B\u00e1bjism to be connected in origin with the Wahh\u00e1b\u00ed movement, and cites the prohibition of the kaly\u00e1n and coffee by the former as evidence in favour of this view.\n\n\\(^2\\) See Rosen, JNSS Arabes, pp. 183, 185.\n\n\\(^3\\) Alluding, apparently, to the new law revealed to himself, and comparing the \u2018Ulem\u00e1 and Mull\u00e1s to those who seduced the Israelites to worship the golden calf.\nthe Merciful, from the tongue of celebration of this Arabian youth, the son of \u2018Al\u00ed the Arabian;\u201d a few lines further on he describes himself as \u201cH\u00e1dha\u2019l-ghul\u00e1mu\u2019l-\u2018arab\u00edyyu\u2019l-Muhammad\u00edyyu\u2019l-\u2018Alaw\u00edyyu\u2019l-F\u00e1t\u00edm\u00edyyu\u2019l-Makkiyyu\u2019l-Mad\u00e1n\u00edyyu\u2019l-Abtah\u00edyyu\u2019l-\u2018Ir\u00e1ki,\u201d \u201cThis Arabian youth, of Muhammad, of \u2018Al\u00ed, of F\u00e1tima, of Mecca, of Medina, of Bath\u00e1, of \u2018Ir\u00e1k.\u201d In another passage he alludes to himself as \u201ccalled by the Persians a Shir\u00e1z\u00ed.\u201d\n\nIn other places he speaks of himself in a manner entirely mystical, as \u201cthe Light on Sinai, and Sinai in the rising-place of the manifestation\u201d (an-n\u00faru f\u00ed\u2019t-T\u00far, wa\u2019t-T\u00faru f\u00ed ma\u1e6dlu\u2019 idh\u2019dhuh\u00far); \u201cthe (letter) Ba which permeates the water of the Letters, and the Point which stands at the Gate of the two Alifs\u201d (Al-B\u00e1\u2019us-s\u00e1\u2019iratu f\u00ed l-m\u00e1\u2019il-hur\u00fafin (sic) wa\u2019n-Nuk\u00e1tu\u2019l-w\u00e1k\u00edfatu \u2018\u00e1l\u00e1 b\u00e1bi\u2019l-Al\u00edfeyn); \u201cthe mystery (which is) in the Gospel Syrian, and in the Pentateuch Hebraic, and the mystery concealed in the Kur\u2019\u00e1n (which is) of Muhammad\u201d (As-s\u00edrru f\u00ed l-Inj\u00edl Sury\u00e1n\u00ed, wa\u2019s-s\u00edrru f\u00ed l-Tawr\u00e1t rabb\u00e1u\u2019i, wa\u2019s-s\u00edrru\u2019l-must\u00e1s\u00edrru f\u00ed l-Furk\u00e1n \u00c1hmadi).\n\nIt was probably at about the period which this book repre-\n\n1 Baron Rosen, in his work entitled \u201cLes Manuscrits Arabes de l\u2019Institut des Langues Orientales\u201d (St. Petersburg, 1877), says, in a note on this passage (p. 186), \u201cCe jeune homme, qui est tant\u00f4t \u2018Arabi\u2019, tant\u00f4t \u2018Ajami\u2019, Mudani, etc., revient tr\u00e8s-souvent dans le courant du livre (. . . presque sur chaque feuillet), sans que l\u2019on puisse comprendre exactement son r\u00f4le.\u201d I have no doubt myself that M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad is throughout speaking of himself. He calls himself \u201cMuhammad\u00ed,\u201d \u201c\u2018Alawi,\u201d \u201cF\u00e1timi,\u201d because, as a Seyyid, he is descended from these. That he should describe himself as a Shir\u00e1z\u00ed is only natural, as is the use of the epithet \u2018Ajami (Persian); but it is harder to see for what reason he calls himself \u201cMakki,\u201d \u201cMadani,\u201d \u201c\u2018Ir\u00e1ki,\u201d etc. I can only suppose that on account of his visits to Mecca and Medina, and his sojourn at Kerbel\u00e1, he considers himself entitled to apply these titles to himself. In the whole of what I have written concerning the \u201cCommentary on the Sura-i-Y\u00fasuf\u201d I wish to express my profound obligations to Baron Rosen\u2019s work, of which I have availed myself freely, not having the original at hand.\n\n2 I imagine that the B\u00e1b, following other Eastern mystics, means by this the \u2018\u00c1kli-Kull, or Universal Intelligence. Sheyk Muh\u00edyyu\u2019d-D\u00edn ibnu\u2019l-\u2018Ar\u00e1b\u00ed, who flourished in the beginning of the twelfth century of our era, and whose works are much esteemed by the S\u00faf\u00eds, says, in his Commentary on the first chapter of the Kur\u2019\u00e1n, \u201cHere is a subtle point, which is this, that the prophets . . . have placed the letters of the alphabet in correspondence with the degrees of Existences . . . and therefore it is said, \u2018Existences emerged from the B\u00e1 o Bismi\u2019ll\u00e1h,\u2019 since that is the letter which follows the Al\u00edf, which is placed to correspond with the Essence of God. And it (i.e. the letter Ba) signifies the First Intelligence, which was the first thing which God created.\u201d\n\n3 I only hazard a guess at the meaning of these passages, especially the last two, which are very obscure. Indeed as they stand they appear to contravene the rules of grammar.\nsents that an event occurred which deserves passing notice. The B\u00e1b wrote to H\u00e1j\u00ed Muhammad Kar\u00edm Kh\u00e1n (who, as has been mentioned, refused to admit that the former was the lawful successor of H\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid K\u00e1zim, which he himself claimed to be), and invited him to acknowledge his authority. This the latter not only entirely refused to do, but further wrote a treatise against the B\u00e1b and his doctrines.\u00b9 A copy of this was sent to the B\u00e1b, and placed in his hands, while he was surrounded by his disciples, to one of whom he handed the book, desiring him to read some of it aloud. The latter accordingly began at the beginning, which ran in this fashion: \u201cThus says the sinful (ath\u00edm) servant, Muhammad Kar\u00edm, son of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm.\u201d Now it is usual for a Musulm\u00e1n author to speak of himself as \u201cstanding in need of God\u2019s mercy,\u201d \u201cpoor, and of no account,\u201d and the like; but not as \u201cath\u00edm\u201d (a word chosen by the B\u00e1b\u2019s adversary, doubtless, because it rhymes with Kar\u00edm and Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm), which has a much worse signification, denoting actual impiety. When the B\u00e1b heard this, therefore, he said, \u201cThat is sufficient; he has condemned himself out of his own mouth.\u201d He then took the book, and wrote on the title-page the Arabic letters H\u00e1-M\u00edm, and sent it back to its author, who probably did not fail to understand the allusion, which consisted in a reference to the chapter of the Kur\u2019\u00e1n entitled S\u00faratu\u2019d-Dukh\u00e1n (which commences with these mystical letters), and the forty-second and following verses thereof, which run as follows:\n\n\u201cInna shajarata\u2019z-zakk\u00fam. (43) Ta\u2019\u00e1mu\u2019l-ath\u00edm. . . . (48) Dhuk! innaka anta\u2019l-\u2018azizu\u2019l-kar\u00edm!\u201d\n\n\u201cVerily (the fruit of) the tree of al-Zakk\u00fam shall be the food of the impious (ath\u00edm); . . . . Taste (this); for thou art that mighty (and) honourable (kar\u00edm) person.\u201d\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 At least two such treatises were written by H\u00e1j\u00ed Muhammad Kar\u00edm Kh\u00e1n. One of them was composed at a later date than this, probably after the B\u00e1b\u2019s death, at the special request of N\u00e1siru\u2019d-D\u00edn Sh\u00e1h. Of these two, one has been printed, and is called \u201cthe crushing of falsehood\u201d (Izh\u00e1kul-B\u00e1t\u0131l); the other was shown to me by a Sheykhi at Kirm\u00e1n, but I do not know what name it bears.\n\n\u00b2 Sale\u2019s Koran, ch. xliiv. For a similar anecdote see Ouseley\u2019s Biographical Notices of Persian Poets, London, 1816, pp. 84\u201386.\nThis passage is said to have been specially levelled against Ab\u00fa Jahl, the great opponent of Muhammad; and since the B\u00e1bis believe that in every Zuh\u016br or \"manifestation\" there must be a \"Point of Darkness,\" opposed to the \"Point of Light,\" they readily accepted this wonderfully appropriate application of the words of the Kur\u2019\u00e1n, and thenceforth identified H\u00e1j\u00ed Muhammad Kar\u00edm Kh\u00e1n with the former.\n\nWe must now turn to consider the latest works of the B\u00e1b, in which his doctrine is fully elaborated.\n\nWe know, from the investigations of M. le Comte de Gobineau, that there are at least three Bey\u00e1ns, two of these being in Arabic, and one in Persian. Of the shorter Arabic Bey\u00e1n a translation is given by this writer in his \"Religions et Philosophies dans l\u2019Asie Centrale.\" The original text of this I have not seen, neither do I know whether it exists in Europe, though it is probably included amongst the B\u00e1b\u00ed MSS. obtained by Gobineau in Persia, which were six in number.\u00b9 A work, which would seem to be the longer Arabic Bey\u00e1n, is mentioned by Dorn,\u00b2 who gives extracts from it, but of this likewise I do not possess a copy, neither do I think that it is to be found in the British Museum.\n\nWith the Persian Bey\u00e1n it is otherwise. A very good MS. copy of this, written by the great B\u00e1b\u00ed poet Nabil, whose chronology of the life of Beh\u00e1 I have already spoken of, exists in the British Museum (Or. 2819). Another copy, in the St. Petersburg Library, is very fully described, with extracts, by Baron Victor Rosen.\u00b3 A third I was fortunate enough to obtain with some difficulty, and much entreaty, from some of my B\u00e1b\u00ed friends in Persia; and I have satisfied myself of its identity with the other two. I shall therefore take this as representing the ultimate doctrine of the B\u00e1b, since I have been able to study it at my leisure, and there is ample internal evidence in it to prove that it\n\n\u00b9 See Bulletin de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Imp\u00e9riale des Sciences de St. Petersbourg, April 13th, 1871. Unfortunately no details are given about these six B\u00e1b\u00ed MSS., so that it is impossible to identify them. I learn from Baron Rosen that they are now in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale at Paris.\n\n\u00b2 Ibid. Dec. 22nd, 1864. See also Baron Rosen, MSS. Arabes, pp. 179\u2013180.\n\n\u00b3 Baron Rosen, Manuscrits Persans de l\u2019Institut, etc., St. Petersburg, 1886, pp. 1\u201332.\nwas composed during the last three years of the life of its author, i.e. during his imprisonment at M\u00e1ku (1847\u20131850). Before proceeding to sum up the doctrines contained in this, however, I will dispose of the other works of the B\u00e1b.\n\nThese, as I have pointed out, were numerous; but so far as I am aware no copy of the Commentaries on the S\u00faras entitled respectively B\u00e1kara, Kawthar, or \u2018A\u1e63r has found its way to Europe. It is much to be hoped that efforts to obtain these may be made by those who have the opportunity of doing so, in order that all the materials for an exhaustive examination of the tenets of this religion and their gradual development may be collected while this is still possible.\n\nOf one other work, however, which is attributed to the B\u00e1b, I possess a copy. This is known amongst the B\u00e1bis as the \u201cSeven Proofs\u201d (Dal\u0101\u2019il-i-Sab\u2018a), but my MS. thereof is, as usual, without title. This is a comparatively short treatise, written in proof of the divine mission of the B\u00e1b. I am unable to determine its authorship, but from the style of the document I do not think that it was composed by the B\u00e1b himself, although it is less easy to pronounce positively on this point than might at first sight appear, inasmuch as the latter always speaks of himself in the third person as \u201cthe Point\u201d (N\u016b\u1e25ta), \u201cthe Tree of Truth\u201d (Shajara-i-Hakikat), or \u201cthe Gate\u201d (B\u00e1b), as the case may be; and moreover his followers naturally to some extent imitated his style and manner of thought and expression. I should conjecture the writer to have been one of the B\u00e1b\u2019s companions rather than himself. The epistle in question appears to have been written in answer to a letter from one of the disciples of the late H\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid K\u00e1zim, containing sundry questions, and setting forth certain difficulties which the questioner experienced with regard to the acceptance of the B\u00e1b. Hence the writer several times quotes sayings of Sheyk\u1e25 Al\u1e25mad Al\u1e25s\u00e1\u2019\u00ed and H\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid K\u00e1zim, adding in the ease of the latter such remarks as \u201cwhich you yourself have repeatedly heard from the departed Seyyid,\u201d \u201cfor you yourself are one of the disciples of the departed Seyyid,\u201d etc.\n\nThough we cannot with certainty determine either the\nwriter of the letter, or the person to whom it was addressed, it is possible to fix the date of its composition approximately. It was written after the publication of the Bey\u00e1n, from which the writer quotes, and of which he speaks much. The B\u00e1b is also spoken of twice as confined \"in the mountain of M\u00e1ku,\" and allusion is made to the sufferings which he had undergone. Now the B\u00e1b was imprisoned at M\u00e1ku for about three years, viz. from the spring of A.D. 1847 till his martyrdom in July, 1850, and this book was therefore composed during this period. But one passage, if I understand it aright, fixes its date still more accurately, for the writer quotes a prophetic tradition of Kumeyl concerning the events of five successive years of the Zuh\u00far, and, speaking of the first four, points out this prophecy as already fulfilled, adding, \"and in the fifth year thou shalt see (fulfilled), 'there shone forth a light from the morning of Eternity,' if thou dost not thyself flee away and become troubled.\"\n\nNow since \"the beginning of the Zuh\u00far\" was in A.H. 1260 (A.D. 1844), this would fix the date of this work as A.H. 1264, or early in A.H. 1265 (A.D. 1848\u201349), i.e. about a year or a year and a half before the B\u00e1b's death.\n\nThe book itself contains an excellent summary of the arguments for the truth of the new religion, which are also given in substance, but with less conciseness and sequence, in the Persian Bey\u00e1n; and in a fuller form in the \u00cdk\u00e1n. I shall therefore choose this place to set them forth once and for all. In doing so, I shall state them as briefly as is consistent with clearness; and, as none of the three works from which I quote are yet available to the public, it appears to me unnecessary to give references to particular passages.\n\nBriefly stated, then, the line of argument is this: The Unchanging and Unchangeable Essence of God has existed from Eternity of Eternities in unapproachable Glory and Purity. No one has known It as It should be known, and no one has praised It as It should be praised. It is above all Names, and free from all Likenesses or Similitudes. All things are known by It, while It is more glorious than that It should be known through aught else. From It was pro-\nduced Its Creation, which has had no beginning in time, and shall have no end. This Emanation or Creation was produced by the Primal Will (Mashiyyat-i-U\u2019ll\u00e1), and though eternal in duration, is subsequent to the latter as to causation. Since it is impossible for created beings to know the Divine Essence, the Primal Will has, for their guidance and instruction, incarnated itself from time to time in a human form. These incarnations are known as \u201cProphets,\u201d and there have been endless numbers of them in the Past, as there will be in the future. That which spoke in all the prophets of the Past, now speaks through the B\u00e1b (or the Nukta, to speak more accurately, since, as we have seen, the former title belongs to a period antecedent to these teachings), and will speak through \u201cHim whom God shall manifest\u201d (Man yudhhiru\u2019ll\u00e1h), and after him through others, for there is no cessation to these Manifestations. The Primal Will is like the Sun, which rises and sets day after day, but is always the same Sun in reality, though we may, in ordinary parlance, speak of \u201cthe sun of to-day,\u201d or \u201cthe sun of yesterday.\u201d So in like manner, though we may, in common language, speak of Adam, Noah, Moses, David, Jesus, and Muhammad as distinct, in truth that which spoke in each of them was One, viz. the Primal Will. This is the meaning of the saying of Muhammad, \u201cAmna\u2019n-nabiyy\u00fana, fa-an\u00e1,\u201d \u201cBut as to the prophets, I (am them).\u201d The last manifestation of the Primal Will took place 1270 years ago (counting not from the hijra, but from the first revelations received by Muhammad till the beginning of this Zuh\u00far), and it has now incarnated itself in M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad, the Nukta, and speaks through him.\n\nIn each manifestation news has been given of the following one. Thus the Jews were told to expect a Messiah, but when he came as Jesus they rejected him, because they had imagined his coming in a different way, and one which was impossible, and contrary to nature. So again the followers of Christ were told to expect His return, yet when He returned as Muhammad they for the most part failed to recognize Him, and are to this day expecting His coming,\nalthough more than a thousand years have elapsed since that took place. So likewise the Muhammadans are expecting the coming of the Im\u00e1m Mahd\u00ed, and continue to pray for that day when he shall appear, and, whenever they mention his name, add the formula \"ajjala'll\u00e1hu farajah,\" \"May God hasten his gladness;\" yet now he has come, with verses and signs (\u00e1y\u00e1t va bayyin\u00e1t), they refuse to recognize him, because the manner of his coming does not correspond with their own vain imaginings of how he ought to come.\n\nThe Muhammadans in particular are now addressed thus: You blame the Jews because they did not accept Christ as the promised Messiah. You also condemn the Christians because they did not recognize Muhammad as the Promised Comforter, although Christ has clearly said, \"Ya'ti min ba'di ah\u00e1dun, ismuhu Ahmad\" (One shall come after me whose name is Ahmad).\n\nYou admit that they were led to expect certain prodigies as announcing and ushering in this return of the Promised One, but that these were intended, and should have been understood, in a spiritual sense. So far you are right. All sacred books are written in a mystical language which needs interpretation, as it is said by the Prophet of the Kur'\u00e1n that each verse has meanings within meanings; and as the Im\u00e1ms have said, 'Nahnu natakallamu bi-kal\u00e1min, wa nuridu minhu ihd\u00e1 wa sab'\u00edma wajhan,' 'We speak with a speech, and intend by it seventy-one (different) aspects.' This symbolic language is common to all the prophets, and the key to it is given in the sacred books themselves. By the Sun, for instance, is meant the Primal Will, manifesting itself in the Prophet of the Age, as before explained. By the Moon and stars are meant his immediate companions and disciples.\n\n1 It is generally believed by Muhammadans, at any rate in Persia, that such words were spoken by Christ, and are to be found in the Gospels. The belief is no doubt based on the prophecies concerning the Paraclete, for which word they would substitute Periklutos, which corresponds in meaning with Ahmad or Muhammad (praised, laudable). See Ibn Hish\u00e1m's \"Life of Muhammad,\" ed. W\u00fcstenfeld, vol. i. pp. 149-150, where the Greek word is stated as Baraklit\u00eds, and the Syriac as Manhamaan\u00e1.\n\n2 I have not ventured to alter the MS. reading, though I think it should be ah\u00e1dan rather than ihd\u00e1.\nThus, when amongst the signs of the 'end of the world,' or 'the coming of the Promised One' (both of which mean the same thing, for only the cycle of one Manifestation comes to an end, while the actual world is eternal), it is said that 'the Sun shall be darkened, and the stars shall fall from heaven,' or the like, what is meant is that the sacred book of the last Manifestation is abrogated, and the divines, or priests, or mull\u00e1s, whose honour and position depended on their being the expounders of that book, have fallen from this high privilege, since their book is now superseded by another. Such is the meaning of the S\u00faratu't-Takw\u00edr (ch. lxxxii. Sale's translation), 'When the Sun shall be folded up; and when the stars shall fall,' and of the S\u00faratu'l-Infi\u1e6d\u00e1\u0301r (ch. lxxxii.), which begins, 'When the heavens shall be cloven in sunder, and when the stars shall be scattered.'\n\nNow the Muhammadans blame the Jews and Christians, yet act in precisely the same way themselves, urging as a reason for not accepting this manifestation that the expected signs of the Im\u00e1m's coming have not appeared. Either they must admit that the latter were justified in their conduct, or they must abandon the puerile objections whereby they seek to justify their own unbelief.\n\nHave they accepted Isl\u00e1m intelligently, or unintelligently as a mere inheritance from their parents? If the latter, they are not truly believers at all, inasmuch as they believe without reason, and are, in fact, exactly like the unbelievers of old, who answered the appeals of the prophets who came to them with the words, \"Verily we found our fathers in this religion, and we follow them.\" If the former, by reason of what proofs have they accepted it? They have never seen the prophet, neither have they witnessed any miracles, so that the written word of the prophet only is their proof. This, too, was the proof to which Mu\u1e25ammad always appealed. When his opponents demanded a sign, he challenged them to imitate the Kur'\u00e1n, saying, 'Produce a s\u00fara like it, if yo speak truly.' No one of his adversaries was able to do this, and for twelve centuries and more the challenge had remained unanswered. Now, in these days, a young man of the race\nof H\u00e1shim, M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad of Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, had come, and claimed a divine mission, in proof of which he had produced verses and a book like the Kur\u2019\u00e1n, but surpassing it in wisdom and eloquence. If then the Kur\u2019\u00e1n itself was a sufficient proof of the divine mission of Muhammad, the Bey\u00e1n was equally satisfactory evidence of the truth of the prophetic claim advanced by its writer. Which was more wonderful? That Muhammad, brought up from his youth amongst the Arabs, should, in the course of a sufficiently long life, produce a comparatively small book like the Kur\u2019\u00e1n, written in his native language; or that this young Sh\u00edr\u00e1z\u00ed, untrained in the learning of colleges, and accounted as nought by the learned, should in the space of a few hours write thousands of verses, like those of the Kur\u2019\u00e1n, in Arabic, which was not his native tongue, and in which he had not been instructed? It was objected that the verses of the Bey\u00e1n were not only *not eloquent*, but that they were full of grammatical errors. Such an objection showed ignorance of the nature of the proof on which Muhammad\u2019s claim rested. The Kur\u2019\u00e1n was not so \u201celoquent\u201d in the ordinary meaning of the term as many of the old Arabic poems, like the Mu\u2019allak\u00e1t, written in the \u2018days of ignorance.\u2019 The eloquence intended and appealed to as a proof of divine inspiration was the quality of profoundly affecting men\u2019s hearts, so that they were ready to die for their convictions; the power of realization or actualization possessed alike by the Divine and the Prophetic word. It is written that \u201cWhen God wishes to create anything, He only says \u2018Be,\u2019 and it is.\u201d The word of the Prophet, who is an incarnation of the Primal Will, has the same quality. What he says comes to pass. Muhammad said, \u2018Make a pilgrimage to Mecca,\u2019 and now each year brings thousands flocking thither. He said, \u2018Fast in Ramaz\u00e1n,\u2019 and millions obey him year by year, in spite of the inconvenience they thereby suffer. Now once again a new command has come forth; once more, in answer to the divine \u2018*A-lasta-bi-rabbikum?*\u2019\u00b9 (\u2018Art thou not\n\n\u00b9 *R\u00faz-i-\u2018Alast\u2019* (The Day of \u2018Art thou not?\u2019) is a phrase familiar to all students of Persian poetry. The tradition is that in the beginning of Creation God addressed\nof thy Lord's?'), thousands have answered, 'Bal\u00e1! Bal\u00e1!' ('Yea! Yea!')\n\nThe word of the 'Nukta' (M\u00edrz\u00e1 'Al\u00ed Muhammad) is as powerful to change and to construct as the word of Muhammad. For the rest, the Kur'\u00e1n, like the Bey\u00e1n, might, when first produced, have been declared less eloquent in style, less accurate in grammar, and less pure in diction, than ancient Arabic poems like the Mu'allak\u00e1t. Now it is regarded as the criterion of eloquence, as the Bey\u00e1n will be. Divine revelations cannot be criticized as regards style and grammar, for the latter are merely deduced from them.\n\nSuch, in brief, is the line of argument adopted by the B\u00e1bis in dealing with Muhammadans. Its cogency is so far recognized by many of the latter that they do not often seek to meet a B\u00e1b\u00ed missionary in fair discussion; and I have heard it said by Persian Muslims who had fallen in with the latter on the pilgrimage to Mecca or Kerbel\u00e1, where free speech was possible, that as a last resort they were compelled to declare that they were sceptics (l\u00e1-maz-hab), since in no other way could they escape the logic of their opponents.\n\nWhen dealing with Christians, Jews, or Zoroastrians, the B\u00e1bis adapt their arguments to the particular case, which the knowledge their missionaries generally possess of the respective beliefs of each enables them to do with considerable skill.\n\nI now come to the Persian Bey\u00e1n, the latest and fullest of the B\u00e1b's works. As I have already discussed the controversial portion of it above, it only remains for me to speak\n\nthe souls that had been created with these words, \"A-lasta bi-rabbikum?\" and they all answered, \"Bal\u00e1! Bal\u00e1!\" (\"Yea! Yea!\")\". According to another tradition, only the souls of believers answered 'Yea.' The B\u00e1bis apply the tradition in this way, viz. as the summons of the Primal Will speaking through a Prophet, and inviting all to follow him, for, as we have seen, with them Creation is co-existent in duration with God, and only subsequent in causation.\n\nThis is stated explicitly in the first chapter of the second Vahid of the Persian Bey\u00e1n: \"Va agar nukt\u00e9 giri dar i'r\u00e1b-i-kird'at, yd kav\u00e9d'id-i-arabiyy\u00e9 shavad, mard\u00fad-ast; z\u00edr\u00e1 ki in kaw\u00edd'\u00ed az \u00e1y\u00e1t bar d\u00e1sht\u00e9 mi-shavad, na \u00e1y\u00e1t bar dinh\u00e1 j\u00fari mi-shavad,\" \"And if exception be taken to the vocalization (i.e. pointing) of the text (lit. reading), or the rules of Arabic (according to which it is written), he (i.e. the objector) is rejected; for these rules are removed from (revealed) verses, nor do the verses flow forth according to them.\" See Baron Rosen's Manuscripts Persans, p. 3, where the verse in question is quoted, and explained.\nbriefly of the doctrines it embodies (in so far as they have not been stated already) and the ordinances it lays down. The reasons which have led me to take the Persian Bey\u00e1n instead of either of the two Arabic Bey\u00e1ns have been already set forth.\n\nOn a perusal of the Bey\u00e1n, three peculiarities therein strike us most forcibly. These are: firstly, the peculiar arrangement of the chapters into groups of nineteen; secondly, the stress which is laid on the doctrine that this revelation is not final, but that believers therein must continually expect the coming of Him whom God shall manifest, who will confirm what he pleases of the Bey\u00e1n, and alter what he pleases; thirdly, the certainty with which the writer speaks of the ultimate prevalence which his religion will obtain. These three points must be considered in detail.\n\nFirst, then, what is the significance of the number nineteen, and of the peculiar arrangement of the Bey\u00e1n?\n\nEach of the letters of the Arabic alphabet has, as is well known, a numerical value, and according to these values they are arranged in an order differing somewhat from that in which they are ordinarily placed. Hence every word may be represented by a corresponding number, formed by adding together the values of its component letters. This property is utilized in representing dates by a sentence which at once describes the events, and sums up in the numerical values of its component letters that number which it is desired to chronicle. The cabbalistic method of interpreting texts, or discovering their inmost meanings, depends on the same property of the letters, as does the science of talismans. In short, the \"Science of the Letters,\" and the \"Science of Numbers,\" are in the East highly esteemed and diligently cultivated, and skill therein has always been considered an accomplishment of the highest order. The subject has been treated of at considerable length by M. le Comte de Gobineau in his Trait\u00e9 des Ecritures Cun\u00e9iformes. Sheykh Mu\u1e25iyyu\u2019d-D\u012bn ibnu\u2019l-\u2018Arab\u012b, a learned Arab of Spain, who flourished at the end of the twelfth and beginning of the thirteenth centuries of our era, and whose numerous and erudite\nwritings profoundly affected Muhammadan mysticism, and are still eagerly studied in Persia and Turkey, employed this science largely in his interpretation of the Kur\u2019\u00e1n. I have already, in a note, made use of his explanation of the meaning of the letter B\u00e1, to explain why the B\u00e1b called himself \u201cthe B\u00e1 which pervades all the Letters;\u201d and the fact that he also discovered the sacred character of the number nineteen may well make us ask if the B\u00e1b may not also have been influenced by his views.\n\nInteresting as the \u201cScience of the Letters\u201d is, I have not space to treat of it here at any length, but must confine myself to what is necessary for a comprehension of the point under discussion. We have seen that the letter B\u00e1 in the world of letters corresponds to the \u201cPrimal Will\u201d or \u201cFirst Intelligence,\u201d since it \u201cfollows the (letter) Alif, which is placed to correspond with the Essence of God.\u201d Now Alif stands for One, and in Arabic One is \u2018V\u00e1hid.\u2019 If we add up the numerical values of the letters in this word V\u00e1hid, we find that the number 19 results. Thus 1 represents the unmanifested Essence of God, and 19 the first manifestation of the same. Again, God is absolute Being, which in Arabic is called \u201cVuj\u00fad.\u201d If we add up the letters in this word, 19 is again produced. So also in the formula \u2018Bismi\u2019ll\u00e1hi\u2019r-Rahm\u00e1ni\u2019r-Ra\u1e25\u00edm,\u2019 \u201cIn the Name of God the Merciful the Clement,\u201d which is used before commencing any action, there are 19 letters.\n\nNow all things that exist do so only so far as they are permeated by the Divine Essence. It is the One Being diffused through them, and manifested in them, which raises them from Nothingness (\u2018adam) to the rank of \u201cContingent\u201d or \u201cPossible Being\u201d (imk\u00e1n), i.e. Being, the existence or non-existence of which is equally possible (as opposed to \u201cVuj\u00fad-i-V\u00e1jibu\u2019l-Vuj\u00fad,\u201d \u201cNecessarily Existing Being,\u201d which cannot even be thought of as ceasing to exist). This afflux of Being whereby the Contingent exists is called \u2018Feyz-i-Akdas\u2019 (the Most Holy Outpouring), and sometimes \u2018V\u00e1hid-i-s\u00e1ri dar jam\u00ed\u2019-i-a\u2019d\u00e1d,\u2019 \u201cthe One which pervades all the Numbers.\u201d When, therefore, we descend from the\nsphere of Absolute Being, and the undifferentiated Divine Essence, to that of \"the Names,\" i.e. of Differentiation and Plurality, we must take into account the \"One pervading the Numbers\" whereby the latter exist.\n\nThus, one of the principal Attributes or Names of God is 'Hayy,' the Living. If we take the sum of the letters of this word, we find it is 18. Adding to this the number of the Alif\u2014the \"One pervading the Numbers\"\u2014we again get the sacred number 19.\n\nThe number 1, therefore, represents the Unmanifested, Undifferentiated, Unknowable Essence; 19, the manifestation thereof. Going a step further, we find $19 \\times 19$, i.e. 361, represents the manifested Universe. This the B\u00e1b\u00eds call \"'adad-i-kullu shey,\" \"the number of All Things;\" and if we add up the values of the letters in 'kullu shey,' we find they come to 360, which, with the \"One pervading the Numbers,\" makes 361.\n\nThe number 19, being thus recognized by the B\u00e1b as the sacred number, plays a prominent part in his system. God, the One (V\u00e1hid=19), the True Existence (Vuj\u00fad=19), the Living (Hayy + the One pervading the Numbers=19), by means of the 19 \"Letters of the Living\" (Hur\u00faf\u00e1t-i-Hayy) created \"All Things\" (kullu shey + the One pervading the Numbers=361=19 $\\times$ 19).\n\nIn the World, He is represented by M\u00edrz\u00e1 'Al\u00ed Muhammad, the \"Point\" (Nukta), and the 18 disciples, called \"Letters of the Living,\" who first believed in him; these together constituting the complete \"Unity\" (V\u00e1hid). Each of the 19 members of the \"Unity\" had 19 immediate disciples, who represent the \"Number of all things\" (361).\n\nEverything is arranged to correspond to this. The Arabic Bey\u00e1n consists of 19 v\u00e1hids (unities) each containing 19 B\u00e1bs (chapters). The B\u00e1b\u00ed year consists of 19 months, each containing 19 days. Nineteen names serve to indicate alike the months and days. Thus the first month is called Shahr\u00fa'l-\n\n---\n\n1 Letters marked with tashdid to double them are only counted once in the enumeration. Thus, in our word, kaf=20, lam=30, shin=300, y\u00e1=10, total 360. Cf. Gobineau, \"Religions et Philosophies dans l'Asie Centrale,\" pp. 319-322.\nBeh\u00e1, and the first day of any month Yaumul-Beh\u00e1, the remaining names being as follows: 2nd Jal\u00e1l, 3rd Jim\u00e1l, 4th \u2018Azamat, 5th N\u00far, 6th Rahmat, 7th Kalim\u00e1t, 8th Kem\u00e1l, 9th Asm\u00e1, 10th Izzat, 11th Mashiyyat, 12th Ilm, 13th Kudrat, 14th Kawl, 15th Mas\u00e1\u2019il, 16th Sharaf, 17th Sult\u00e1n, 18th Mulk, and 19th \u2018Ul\u00e1. Supposing, therefore, we wish to name the 12th day of the 5th month according to this notation, we call it \u201cYaumul-Ilm min Shahri\u2019n-N\u00far.\u201d As, however, it appeared probable that the old method of counting by days of the week might linger on for some time, even after the B\u00e1bi arrangement of the year had been adopted as regards the months, it was considered desirable to give new names to the former. These are as follows: Saturday, Yaumul-Jal\u00e1l; Sunday, Yaumul-Jim\u00e1l; Monday, Yaumul-Kem\u00e1l; Tuesday, Yaumul-Fiz\u00e1l; Wednesday, Yaumul-\u2018Id\u00e1l; Thursday, Yaumul-Istijl\u00e1l; Friday, Yaumul-Istikl\u00e1l.\n\nIt must not be supposed that at present this system is much used amongst the B\u00e1bis. It is rather, like the new writing (Khatt-i-Badi\u2019), intended for the future. So far as I know, it is confined to colophons at the end of the sacred books of the sect, and is not often used even for that purpose. When it is used, the day is usually given in both of the two manners explained, as, for instance, in the following colophon from the end of a commentary on the La\u1e25k-i-A\u1e33das: \u201c\u1e24arrarahu fi yaumul-Kem\u00e1l\u00ed, min yaumul-\u2018Ul\u00e1\u2019i, min shahri\u2019n-N\u00fari, min sanati\u2019l-Badiyyi mina\u2019l-v\u00e1hid\u2019t-th-th\u00e1n\u00ed, 1296\u201d (A.H.). \u201cHe wrote it on the day of Kem\u00e1l (Monday), corresponding to the day of \u2018Ul\u00e1 (the 19th day), of the month of N\u00far (the 5th month), of the year of Badi\u2019 of the second V\u00e1hid, A.H. 1296.\u201d\n\n1 It is evident from the latter part of this colophon that a special method of enumerating years is also employed. I regret to say that I did not ask for an explanation of this from the B\u00e1bis at the time when I learned the preceding details about the days and months, so that I do not know what ordinal number in the series of 19 years constituting the v\u00e1hid is represented by the \u2018Sanati\u2019l-Badi.\u2019 One would be inclined to take Badi\u2019 as meaning the first (see Lane\u2019s Arabic-English Lexicon, book i. part i. p. 171); but not only does it not agree with sana (year), but chronological difficulties are involved; for if A.H. 1296 be counted by the B\u00e1bis as the first year of the second v\u00e1hid, i.e. the 20th year from the commencement of their era, the latter would fall in A.H. 1276, in which no important event occurred, for the \u201cmanifestation\u201d of M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad was in A.H. 1260, and the \u201cmanifestation\u201d of Beh\u00e1 in A.H. 1283.\nAlthough the sacred character of the number 19 was thus prominently brought forward by the B\u00e1b, he by no means implies that it was unknown to previous prophets. On the contrary, he not only points out that the number of letters in the \"Bismi'll\u00e1hi'r-Rahm\u00e1ni'r-Rah\u00edm,\" which stands at the head of every chapter in the Kur'\u00e1n, is 19, but further that the total number of the chapters themselves (114 = 19 \u00d7 6) is a multiple of the sacred number. So, in every \"Manifestation,\" the 18 \"Letters\" of the Living have appeared surrounding the \"Point,\" and amongst their number there is always at least one woman\u2014F\u00e1tima in the Manifestation of Isl\u00e1m, Kurratu'l-'Ayn (Jen\u00e1b-i-T\u00e1hir\u00e9) in the present one. I have not a complete list of the 18 disciples of the B\u00e1b who constituted the \"Letters of the Living,\" and each of whom bore a special title, but two at least, besides Kurratu'l-'Ayn, are prominent figures in the history of the sect, viz. Mull\u00e1 Huseyn of Bushraweyh (Jen\u00e1b-i-B\u00e1b\u00fa'l-B\u00e1b), and H\u00e1j\u00ed Mull\u00e1 Muhaminad 'Al\u00ed of B\u00e1lfur\u00fash (Jen\u00e1b-i-Kudd\u00fas). So also the B\u00e1b declares that \"He whom God shall manifest\" will appear with his 18 \"Letters of the Living.\"\n\nIt is unnecessary to describe in detail the part played by the sacred number in the ordinances of the new religion. The system of coinage, the construction of places of worship, the fines inflicted for transgressions, and the taxes to be levied, are all arranged on the same basis, so that, to quote from the Bey\u00e1n (V\u00e1hid vii. ch. viii.), \"It seems to be seen that the mystery of the V\u00e1hid will gain currency till it pervades all things, until even the pens in the pen-case shall be according to the number of the V\u00e1hid.\"\n\nBefore leaving this subject, one point must be noticed. I have said that the B\u00e1b\u00ed sacred books were to be composed on this plan, and that the longer Arabic Bey\u00e1n is so, we know from Dorn's description of the St. Petersburg MS. But the Persian Bey\u00e1n, and the shorter Arabic Bey\u00e1n translated by\n\n---\n\n1 For a similar use of the term \"Letters\" (Hur\u00edf), cf. de Sacy's \"Expos\u00e9 de la Religion des Druzes,\" Paris, 1838, vol. i. p. 119, where the disciples of H\u00e1kim bi-amri'll\u00e1h are called \"Letters of Truth\" (Hur\u00edfu's-sidk).\nGobineau, both cease at the 10th chapter of the 10th V\u00e1hid; in other words, they are only half completed. Was this mere accident? Was the life of their author cut short when these books were but half finished, or was there a reason for the elaborately incomplete form in which they were left? I believe that the latter is the case, and that the half-finished works were intended to be a perpetual reminder to the B\u00e1b's followers that the revelation they had received was not final, and that they must continually look for the coming of \"Him whom God shall manifest.\"\n\nThis brings me to the second peculiarity I spoke of in the Bey\u00e1n. As we have seen, in considering the arguments put forward by the B\u00e1bis, they consider that men have continually fallen into error in not recognizing the fact that the revelation which they believed in was not final. Consequently, on the arrival of the new \"manifestation,\" they have always for the most part rejected it. The B\u00e1b is determined that his followers shall be, as far as possible, prepared and warned against this danger, so that they may have no excuse for failing to recognize and accept \"Him whom God shall manifest\" when he appears.\n\nWe have seen that, according to the B\u00e1b's teaching, all prophets are incarnations or \"manifestations\" of the \"Primal Will.\" In this sense, therefore, they are all equal, but the same cannot be said of their revelations. For the human race is ever progressing, and consequently, just as a child is taught more fully and instructed in more difficult subjects by its master as its understanding ripens, so also the Primal Will, the Instructor ('Murabbi') of mankind, speaks in each successive manifestation with a fuller utterance. As children must be told things in a simple manner which they can easily understand, so with the human race in its earlier stages of development. For instance, if we wish to explain to a child that knowledge is a pleasant thing, we may tell it that it is sweet like sugar, though in reality there is no resemblance between the two things. In the same way, the Primal Will, or Universal Intelligence, speaking through former prophets, has taught men that good is pleasant in its\nresults, and evil bitter, by comparing the condition of the good after death to people in beautiful gardens surrounded with all such things as they are accustomed to consider most pleasant, while the wicked, on the contrary, are said to be consumed in fire. But now the world has reached a stage of development when it can be told the truth about these things without parables and similes, viz. that Paradise is belief, and Hell unbelief. But although this revelation is much fuller than preceding ones, it must not be considered final. On the contrary, it is merely intended to prepare the world for the fuller measure of truth which will be uttered by \"Him whom God shall manifest.\" The Bey\u00e1n is the seed; his revelation will be the fruit. Whenever men are sufficiently \"educated\" in the Bey\u00e1n, \"He whom God shall manifest\" will appear. The day of his coming is known to God alone, and when he comes, he will come suddenly, even as the \"Nukta\" did. Should any one at any time come and claim to be He, and produce the necessary proof of his identity, viz. \"verses\" (ay\u00e1t), no one is to dare to deny him. Thus in the 8th chapter of the 6th Vahid it is written: \"And ye have not so much sense as to perceive that none but God can reveal verses. Know, therefore, that this is the same Primal Reality to whom God revealed verses in the beginning of Isl\u00e1m. If ye had understood the proof of your own religion, you would also have understood this Matter. Just as, from the time of Muhammad until now, which is 1270 years, no one has been able to produce verses like it (i.e. the Kur'\u00e1n), so likewise after the setting of this Sun (i.e. after the death of the B\u00e1b) will it be, until He whom God shall manifest shall appear. It is impossible that any one other than Him whom God shall manifest can lay claim to this Matter. . . . If any one makes such claim, and verses appear from him, none must oppose him, lest perchance sorrow come upon that Sun of Truth. Had the people of the Kur'\u00e1n acted thus, all their books would not have become vain. So, therefore, if you hear of such a matter, and are not certain, do not do anything which may be the cause thereof (i.e. of bringing sorrow on Him whom God shall manifest), even though it really be other than\nhim (i.e. even though the claimant be not really He whom God shall manifest). But this is an impossible idea. But if he (the claimant) merely mention His name (i.e. the name of Him whom God shall manifest), it is far from those who possess His love to grieve him, out of respect for His Name. For the matter is not outside one of two alternatives. Either it is He (and in truth it is impossible that it should be other than Him, in that he reveals verses spontaneously), and why then should any one deny the Truth, since they have acted night and day in expectation thereof? Or, which is an impossible supposition, he is not; in that case let him alone; it is not for creatures to judge him, out of respect to the Name of their Belov\u00e9d.\"\n\nWe cannot fail to be struck by the fact that when the B\u00e1b was a prisoner and an exile at M\u00e1k\u00fa, probably well aware of what his ultimate fate would be, he showed far more anxiety about the reception which should be accorded to \"Him whom God shall manifest\" than about himself. That he did anticipate in some degree the cruel fate in store for him, the following words of his, quoted in the B\u00e1b\u00ed history, sufficiently prove: \"It is as though I heard the voice of one crying in my inmost heart, 'the most acceptable thing is that thou shouldst sacrifice thyself in the way of God, even as Huseyn (upon him be peace) sacrificed himself in my way;' and, did I not regard this mystery, by Him in whose hand is my soul! even were all the Kings of the Earth to assemble, they could not take from me a single letter,\" and he concludes by stating that the object of this sacrifice is \"that all may know the degree of my patience, and contentment, and sacrifice in the way of God.\"\n\nAlmost every ordinance in the Bey\u00e1n is similarly designed to be a perpetual reminder of \"Him whom God shall manifest.\" Thus, in every assembly of believers, a vacant place is to be left for Him, and, if possible, 18 more empty seats for the \"Letters of the Living\" who accompany Him, so that, if they come suddenly, all may be prepared for them.\n\n---\n\n1 These words of the B\u00e1b are also quoted in the Ik\u00e1n, and the passage where they occur is specially noted by Baron Rosen (Manuscrits Persans de l'Institut, etc. p. 43).\nWhenever His name is mentioned, all must rise from their seats. None of the believers in the Bey\u00e1n must grieve one another, nor must children be beaten, lest sorrow be thereby caused to Him whom God shall manifest. Posts, and other means of communication, must be well organized, \"as in the land of the Frank,\" so that, as soon as the new \"manifestation\" takes place, there may be every facility for conveying the news thereof to all parts of the earth. Many other instances might be added, but these are sufficient. Any one who reads the Bey\u00e1n will find \"He whom God shall manifest\" mentioned on every page, and again and again is the hope expressed that, when He comes, He may not suffer at the hands of unbelievers as the B\u00e1b has suffered. When we consider all this, we shall better understand how almost universal was the acceptance met with by Beh\u00e1 amongst the B\u00e1bis when he announced that he was \"He whom God shall manifest.\"\n\nThe third remarkable feature of the Bey\u00e1n which I noticed was the assurance with which the B\u00e1b speaks of the ultimate prevalence of his religion. When we picture to ourselves the circumstances in which he was placed, a prisoner and exile amongst foes, in continual expectation of the inevitable fate which hung over him, and with scarcely a friend to support and encourage him, we cannot but admire the calm conviction with which he writes of the final triumph of his faith, and the confidence wherewith he organizes the model whereon the B\u00e1b\u00ed empires of the future are to be moulded. There is not a word of compromise on the one hand, nor a trace of rancour or desire for revenge on the other. Infidels are to be allowed no part nor lot in the future government; they are not even to be permitted to reside in the five holy provinces of F\u00e1rs (the Land of F\u00e1), 'Ir\u00e1k (the Land of 'Ayn), \u00c1zarbajj\u00e1n (the Land of Alif), Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n (the Land of Kh\u00e1), and M\u00e1zandar\u00e1n (the Land of Mim), nor in any other country whose inhabitants are believers in the Bey\u00e1n, unless they be merchants, or others who follow a useful profession. Every effort is to be made to convert them to the faith, but no violence is to be used, and \"no one is to be slain for unbelief,\"\nfor the slaying of a soul is outside the religion of God; . . . and if any one commands it, he is not and has not been of the Bey\u00e1n, and no sin can be greater for him than this.\"\n\nMuch more might be written on the Bey\u00e1n, but I must at present necessarily content myself with sketching its most important features. It would be interesting to trace out in detail the Utopia which the B\u00e1b had conceived in his mind. Briefly, the future B\u00e1bi community was to be one characterized by brotherly love; dignity combined with courtesy in all dealings and transactions between its members; cultivation of all useful arts and improvements; prohibition of useless occupations and studies, amongst which latter are included Logic, Jurisprudence (Fiqh), Philosophy, and Dead Languages; amelioration of the condition of women, who were to be allowed to appear in society; general elementary education; provision for the poor out of the common treasury at the discretion of the members of the \"House of Justice\" (Beytu'l-'Adl), but strict prohibition of mendicity. The object of forbidding the study of philosophy, logic, etc., seems to have been the prevention of disputation and wrangling, which are strongly condemned, as destructive of that harmony which it is desired to secure. Pilgrimages are not much encouraged, particularly in the case of women, and travelling is restricted. Children are to be treated with kindness and affection, and allowed to play and enjoy themselves as much as possible, and penalties are imposed on any one who shall beat them severely. They are not to be made to stand at their lessons, lest they should be fatigued, but are to be allowed to sit on chairs, which it is recommended that all believers should do rather than on the ground.\n\nAmongst many such ordinances which suggest to us the idea that the B\u00e1b had in some degree taken European civilization as his model, we find others which recall rather the pomp and ceremony of the religions of the Past. This is especially the case with regard to the instructions laid down for the enshrouding and burial of the dead. These are to be washed first three or five times with water in\na certain definite manner, and with certain prayers and ejaculations; then, if possible, with rose water. A cornelian ring, on which one of the Names of God is engraved, is then to be placed on one of the fingers of the right hand; after which the corpse is to be shrouded with five garments of different stuffs, beginning with silk and ending with cotton. During all these operations, the utmost reverence is to be observed in moving and turning the corpse, for \"the outward body is the throne ('arsh) of the inward or essential body (jasad-i-b\u0101\u1e6dini, jasad-i-z\u0101ti), therefore must the former be preserved with the utmost care, that no disgust may come upon the latter; for the Essential body regards its Throne, and is gratified if that be treated with respect.\" These preliminaries completed, the body is to be placed in a coffin or sarcophagus of glass or crystal (ball\u016br), or hard polished stone. Public prayers are then to be performed over the dead, and this is the only occasion when they are permitted. At other times people must perform their prayers singly. And now comes the strangest regulation of all, which is that the confession of faith of the dead man, and his belief in the \"Divine Point\" (Nukta-i-Il\u0101hiyy\u00e9) and the \"Letters of the Living\" (\u1e24ur\u016bf-i-Hayy), with a declaration of his love for them, and an account of his actions, shall be written and preserved by his heirs till the coming of \"Him whom God shall manifest.\" Can we read these instructions without being reminded on the one hand of the Zoroastrian dislike of polluting the earth by the burial of corpses, and on the other of the \"Book of the Dead\" of the Egyptians?\n\nIf we seek for traces of Zoroastrian ideas in the Bey\u00e1n, we shall not fail to find other instances, such as the formal establishment of a solar instead of a lunar year; the command to observe the Nawruz as the great annual feast; the command to wash by pouring water over oneself, not by plunging into the water; the salutation of the Sun on first beholding it on Friday mornings by reciting the verse, \"The Brightness (Beh\u00e1) on thine aspect is only from God, O rising Sun! and bear witness unto that which God hath\nwitnessed concerning Himself, that there is no God but Him, the Precious, the Belov\u00e9d.\u201d\n\nThe parts of the Bey\u00e1n and, generally speaking, of the B\u00e1b\u00ed doctrine, which are least readily understood, are those which treat of the future life. All the Muhammadan conceptions of the Questioning of the Tomb, the Resurrection, the Bridge of Sir\u00e1t, Hell, and Heaven, are allegorically interpreted. The first is the summons of the next Manifestation to those who are spiritually dead to believe in Him; the second is His appearing, or arising (Kiy\u00e1mat); the third, the \u201cBridge which is finer than a hair and sharper than a sword to the unbelievers, but to the believers more spacious than Paradise,\u201d is belief in the Prophet of the Age, which is so difficult to the self-willed and obstinate, so easy to those who are really seeking after God. The Fire of Hell is ignorance, denial, and negation. Paradise is the joy of believing in and meeting the Manifestation of God, and attaining to the utmost perfection of which one is capable. Hence the perfection of anything is described as the Paradise thereof, as, for instance, in the following passage from V\u00e1hid iv. chapter xi.: \u201cGod, at the time of the revelation of the Bey\u00e1n, looked at all His creation, and established limits for His creation in whatever station they may stand, so that no soul may be in the least grieved or distressed in the Paradise of the Bey\u00e1n, but rather He has ordained that everything should be capable (of this), that they should bring that thing to the summit of its perfection, so that it may not be deprived of its Paradise.\u201d As an instance of what is meant, it is further stated that the Paradise of a text is that it should be written in the most excellent writing, and adorned with gold.\n\nWhen we come to inquire what the B\u00e1b believed and taught about the life after death, we find it hard to give a satisfactory answer. We have seen that he speaks of an \u201cEssential\u201d or \u201cInner Body,\u201d which survives the death of the elementary body, so that it is clear that he believed in some sort of future life; but he does not seem to care to dwell on it, and in one passage says, in speaking of the \u201cBarzakh\u201d (generally understood by the Muhammadans\nsomewhat in the sense of the Greek Hades\\(^1\\)), \"What is intended by Barzakh is merely the interval between two manifestations, and not that (explanation) which is (commonly) known amongst men . . .; for none knoweth what shall be decreed unto them after death except God.\" In another passage he speaks of that Paradise which consists in a knowledge of the Manifestation of God, and the Letters of the One as more glorious than a sensuous Paradise, wherein are \"silken garments, and gold vessels, and excellent meats, and pure wine, and mansions, and h\u00faris.\" It is evident that the B\u00e1b wishes his followers to worship God from love of Him, and not in the hope of reward, as he says in V\u00e1hid vii, chapter xix., \"So worship God that if the recompense of thy worship of Him were to be the Fire, no alteration in thy worship of Him would be produced. If you worship from fear, that is unworthy of the threshold of the holiness of God, nor wilt thou be accounted a Unitarian. So also, if your gaze is on Paradise, and if you worship in hope of that; for then you have made God's creation a Partner with Him.\"\n\nCertain passages in the Bey\u00e1n would tempt us to imagine that the transmigration of souls formed a part of the B\u00e1b's belief and teaching, as would certain modes of expression often employed by the B\u00e1bis. Yet if you ask them whether they believe in metempsychosis (tan\u00e1sukh-i-arv\u00e1h), they will answer in the negative, and declare that the doctrine, though superficially resembling this, is in reality otherwise; but that it cannot easily be understood except by those skilled in philosophy.\n\nIn the face of this it seems presumptuous to attempt to put forward an explanation of what appears to me to be the doctrine really taught by the B\u00e1b, yet, inasmuch as the subject is too important to be passed over, I feel bound to state the opinion I have been led to form on it from a careful consideration of the various passages bearing on the matter in the Bey\u00e1n, only premising that I do not presume to dogmatize on this point.\n\n\\(^1\\) See Sale's Koran, p. 261, note.\nFirst of all, I must make a distinction between \"Individuality\" and \"Personality.\" The former is the real, essential, and permanent part of a man; the latter, the temporary peculiarities which condition him in a particular state. To make the meaning of this clearer, let us take the favourite B\u00e1b\u00ed metaphor of the \"Letters.\" The forms of these exist in the mind in unseen types which cannot be destroyed. They likewise have endless external \"manifestations,\" which are transitory and perishable, and which show forth more or less clearly their original archetype. For instance, the essential character of the letter *Alif*, whereby it is known and individualized, is a straight vertical stroke of the height of five dots (*nuktas*). This form can be written again and again, more or less perfectly. When it is written quite perfectly, it completely corresponds with its ideal archetype, and this is its Paradise. Particular written *alifs* may be destroyed, but only their \"personality\" is destroyed; their individuality returns to the archetypal *Alif*, and their essential part will manifest itself again and again in the world of writing (the External World) as occasion requires.\n\nIt is in this sense that one may pick out all the *alifs* in a page of writing and say that they are the same letter: they are the same as regards individuality, but different in their accidental conditions, such as size, position, and perfection of form. It is the same with men. Just as we may write an *alif* on a piece of paper, and then tear it up and destroy it, and write another, and say, \"Alif has been written again,\" or \"has returned;\" so also we may say, \"Huseyn has returned in M\u00edr.\u00e1 'Al\u00ed Muhammad,\" for both are manifestations in different *ma\u1e93hars* (places of manifestation) of the same Divine \"Letter.\"\n\nThis, I think, is the real sense of passages like the 6th Chapter of the first V\u00e1hid, where it is written, \"Huseyn has returned to the life of the world with all who believed in him,\" or like the following passage from V\u00e1hid iv. chapter v.: \"Those who hold ta'ziyas\u00b9 and weep and lament over the\n\n\u00b9 Ta'ziyas are the representations of the adventures and misfortunes of the Im\u00e1ms, etc., held during the month of Muharram, and especially during the first\nmisfortunes of the first promulgators of Isl\u00e1m, nevertheless imprisoned and oppressed that same person whom they lament, and the learned gave decisions (fatv\u00e1s) against him.\"\n\nIt is this manner of speaking which has led the Muhammadans to assert that the B\u00e1b\u00eds believed in transmigration, and that the reason they met death so fearlessly was their conviction that after forty days they would come to life again.\u00b9\n\nI must now conclude this necessarily imperfect consideration of the doctrine of the B\u00e1b to pass on to the subsequent developments of it by Beh\u00e1 and others. I do so with regret, for who can fail to be attracted by the gentle spirit of M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad? His sorrowful and persecuted life; his purity of conduct, and youth; his courage and uncomplaining patience under misfortune; his complete self-negation; the dim ideal of a better state of things which can be discerned through the obscure and mystic utterances of the Bey\u00e1n; but most of all his tragic death, all serve to enlist our sympathies on behalf of the young prophet of Sh\u00edr\u00e1z. The irresistible charm which won him such devotion during his life still lives on, and still continues to influence the minds of the Persian people. The majority of the B\u00e1b\u00eds of today may regard Beh\u00e1 as \"Him whom God shall manifest,\" and M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed Muhammad merely as his forerunner; yet it is with loving thoughts that they dwell on the memory of the latter. Often they apply to him these lines from an old Persian song:\u00b2\n\nten days thereof, by the Shi'ites. They reach their culminating point in the tragedy of the death of Huseyn and his adherents, cut off from water, and hemmed in by foes in the arid plain of Kerbel\u00e1. My guide from B\u00e1lfur\u00fash to the Tomb of Sheykh Tabarsi informed me that, following out the parallel suggested by the B\u00e1b, his followers, who make pilgrimages to those places where the earliest sufferings of the B\u00e1b\u00eds took place, call the river B\u00e1bul, which flows through B\u00e1lfur\u00fash, the \"Euphrates,\" and Sheykh Tabarsi \"Kerbel\u00e1.\" In the same spirit are the following lines, which form the concluding stanza of a B\u00e1b\u00ed poem of the authorship of which I am uncertain:\n\n\"Shuhadd\u00e1-yi-tal'at-i-n\u00e1r-i-man! Bi-d\u00e1vid s\u00fa-yi-diy\u00e1r-i-man!\nSar \u00fa j\u00fan kunid n\u00edz\u00e1r-i-man! Ki man-am Shahinshah-i-Karbala.\"\n\n\"Ye who have seen my form of flame! Haste to the land from whence I came!\nShed your blood for my holy name, For I am the monarch of Kerbel\u00e1.\"\n\n\u00b9 Cf. Gobineau, op. cit. p. 330.\n\u00b2 I have often asked who was the author of these verses, and have generally been informed that they were Sa'di's, but I have not succeeded in finding them in his published writings.\n\"Sh\u00edr\u00e1z pur ghawg'h\u00e1\u00b9 shavad; shakkar-lab\u00ed peyd\u00e1 shavad; Tarsam kaz ash\u00fab-i-labash bar-ham zanad Baghhd\u00e1d-r\u00e1.\"\n\"Sh\u00edr\u00e1z shall become full of tumult; one shall appear with lips like sugar;\nI am afraid that by the disturbance of his lips he may throw Baghdad into confusion.\"\n\nOr, by a slight modification of a couplet of the poet \u2018Ir\u00e1k\u00ed, they will express their sense of the injustice of the sentence of death pronounced and carried out against their hero:\n\n\"Dar kud\u00e1m mazhab-ast in? dar kud\u00e1m millat-ast in?\nKi kushand dilbari-r\u00e1 ki, \u2018t\u00fa dilrub\u00e1 chir\u00e1\u2019i?\u2019\"\n\"In what sect is this (lawful)? In what religion is this (lawful)?\nThat they should kill a charmer of hearts (saying), \u2018Why art thou a stealer of hearts?\u2019\"\n\nTurning from the B\u00e1b, there is another figure amongst those who took part in this sad drama which irresistibly commands our attention. I mean the beautiful and accomplished Kurratu'l-'Ayn, the heroine, poetess, nay, almost the prophetess, of the new faith, distinguished by the title of \"Jen\u00e1b-i-T\u00e1hir\u00e9,\" \"Her Excellence the Pure.\" Anxious as I was to obtain some of her poems, I only met with a very limited amount of success. None of the B\u00e1bis at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z whom I conversed with had any in their possession, and they said that Kazv\u00edn and Hamad\u00e1n, where Kurratu'l-'Ayn had preached, and Teher\u00e1n, where she had suffered martyrdom, would be the most likely places to obtain them. However, at Yezd I saw copies of two short poems (ghazals) attributed to her authorship. Both of these are in the same metre (k\u00e1mil), and have the same rhyme; and of each of them I obtained a copy for myself. I wrote to one of my friends at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, and asked his opinion on their authenticity. He replied that one of them, beginning\n\n\"Lama'\u00e1tu wajhika ashrak\u00e1t, wa shi'a'u tal'atika'til\u00e1:\nZi ch\u00e9 r\u00fa 'Alasta bi-Rabbikum?' na-zani? Bi-zan ki 'Bal\u00e1! Bal\u00e1!'\"\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Pronounced kawg\u00e1.\nwas not by Kurratu'l-'Ayn, but by a Sufi poet called Shuhbat, of L\u00e1r. Although I have on several occasions heard the latter spoken of by dervishes and others in Persia with the highest approbation, I have neither been able to obtain his works, nor to discover any particulars about him; for he is not mentioned in any of the Biographies of Poets (Tazkir\u00e9s) which I have been able to consult, not even in the Riy\u00e1zu'l-'Arif\u00edn of the learned R\u00edz\u00e1-Kuli Kh\u00e1n, published a year or two ago at Teher\u00e1n.\n\nThe second poem attributed to Kurratu'l-'Ayn, beginning,\n\n\"Jadhab\u00e1tu shau\u010dika aljamat bi-sal\u00e1sili'l-gham wa'l-bal\u00e1\nHama '\u00e1\u0161ik\u00e1n-i-shikast\u00e9-dil, ki dihaud j\u00e1n bi-rah-i-wal\u00e1,\"\n\nwas thought by my friend, and pronounced with certainty by others, to be undoubtedly the work of Kurratu'l-'Ayn.\n\nIn a small work on Persian grammar called Tanbihu'l-Atf\u00e1l, composed by H\u00e1j\u00ed M\u00edrz\u00e1 Huseyn Kh\u00e1n, Persian Consul at Trebizonde, and printed at Constantinople in A.H. 1298 (A.D. 1881), the first verse of the first of these two poems, which I have quoted above, is cited as an example, and its author is stated to be the above-mentioned Shuhbat (Mull\u00e1 Muhammad B\u00e1kir) of L\u00e1r. Further on in the same work a verse occurring in the second poem is quoted, and attributed to M\u00edrz\u00e1 'Abdu'l-Kar\u00edm, whose takhallus was Sim\u00e1. Although these poems, especially the first, can only be referred very doubtfully to the authorship of Kurratu'l-'Ayn, it must be borne in mind that the odium which attaches to the name of B\u00e1b\u00ed amongst Persian Muhammadans would render impossible the recitation by them of verses confessedly composed by her. If, therefore, she were actually the authoress of poems, the grace and beauty of which compelled an involuntary admiration even from her enemies, it would seem extremely probable that they should seek to justify their right to admire them by attributing them to some other writer, and this view is supported by an assertion which I have heard made by a learned Persian with whom I was acquainted in Teher\u00e1n, and who, though not actually a B\u00e1b\u00ed, did not lack a certain amount of\nsympathy for those who were such, to the effect that many poems written by Kurratu'l-'Ayn were amongst the favourite songs of the people, who were for the most part unaware of their authorship. Open allusions to the B\u00e1b had, of course, been cut out or altered, so that no one could tell the source from whence they came.\n\nWithout pretending to assert positively, then, that either of these two poems is by Kurratu'l-'Ayn, I venture to give a translation of the second of them, which I have attempted to versify in imitation of the original metre, so as to afford a better idea of its style than could be given by a literal rendering in prose. In this I have endeavoured to adhere as closely as possible to the sense of the original, even though the English may have suffered thereby. I have chosen the second rather than the first poem, because there is a stronger consensus of opinion in favour of its being the work of Kurratu'l-'Ayn. The text of the poem will be found appended at the end of the paper.\n\nTRANSLATION OF THE POEM BEGINNING \"Jadhab\u00e1tu shawkika aljamat,\" etc.\n\nThe thralls of yearning love constrain in the bonds of pain and calamity\nThese broken-hearted lovers of thine to yield their lives in their zeal for thee.\nThough with sword in hand my Darling stand with intent to slay, though I sinless be,\nIf it pleases him, this tyrant's whim, I am well content with his tyranny.\nAs in sleep I lay at the break of day that cruel Charmer came to me,\nAnd in the grace of his form and face the dawn of the morn I seemed to see.\nThe musk of Cathay might perfume gain from the scent those fragrant tresses rain,\nWhile his eyes demolish a faith in vain attacked by the pagans of Tartary.\nWith you who contemn both love and wine for the hermit's cell and the zealot's shrine,\nWhat can I do? for our faith divine you hold as a thing of infamy?\nThe tangled curls of thy darling's hair, and thy saddle and steed are thy only care,\nIn thy heart the Absolute hath no share, nor the thought of the poor man's poverty.\nSikandar's pomp and display be thine, the Kalandar's habit and way be mine,\nThat, if it please thee, I resign, while this, though bad, is enough for me.\nThe country of \"I\" and \"We\" forsake; thy home in Annihilation make,\nSince fearing not this step to take, thou shalt gain the highest Felicity.\n\nBesides these poems, I have a copy of a Masnav\u00ed of about 570 couplets in the same metre as the Masnav\u00ed of Jal\u00e1lu'd-D\u00edn R\u00fam\u00ed (Ramal-i-musaddas-i-mahz\u00faf) attributed to Kur-ratu'l-'Ayn. That this latter is a B\u00e1b\u00ed poem I have no doubt, but I have not yet had time to examine it carefully with a view to determining whether it may not be a later production in praise of Beh\u00e1 rather than the B\u00e1b. For this reason, and also on account of its length, I leave it for future consideration.\n\nOne more document of great interest which belongs to this earlier period of B\u00e1b\u00fcliism deserves notice, since it affords us an insight into the limitless self-sacrifice and devotion which is so remarkable in the disciples of the B\u00e1b. It is a letter written by \u00c1k\u00e1 Muhammad 'Al\u00ed of Tabr\u00edz to his elder brother on the night before he suffered death with his Master, and the text of it has been preserved for us by the B\u00e1b\u00ed historian, and will be found appended at the end of the paper. It appears that the relatives of \u00c1k\u00e1 Muhammad 'Al\u00ed occupied a good position in Tabr\u00edz, and as they did not believe in the B\u00e1b\u00ed doctrines, they were extremely anxious to persuade him to save himself from death by a recantation.\nThis letter, of which I here give a translation, seems to have been written in answer to a last appeal of this sort from the brother of the writer. It runs as follows:\n\n\"He is the Compassionate.\n\nO thou who art my Kibla! My condition, thanks to God, has no fault, and 'to every difficulty succeedeth ease.' You have written that this matter has no end. What matter, then, has any end? We, at least, have no discontent in this matter; nay, rather we are unable sufficiently to express our thanks for this favour. The end of this matter is to be slain in the way of God, and O! what happiness is this! The will of God will come to pass with regard to his servants, neither can human plans avert the Divine decree. What God wills comes to pass, and there is no power and no strength, but in God. O thou who art my Kibla! the end of the world is death: 'every soul tastes of death.' If the appointed fate which God (mighty and glorious is He) hath decreed overtake me, then God is the guardian of my family, and thou art mine executor: behave in such wise as is pleasing to God, and pardon whatever has proceeded from me which may seem lacking in courtesy, or contrary to the respect due from juniors: and seek pardon for me from all those of my household, and commit me to God. God is my portion, and how good is He as a guardian!\"\n\nThis letter, which bears every mark of genuineness, attracts us as much by its simplicity of style and lack of those epistolary ornaments to which we are accustomed, as by the spirit of courage and resignation which breathes in every line. I, for my part, cannot read it unmoved; for I feel myself face to face with one whose unwavering faith has robbed death of its terrors, and whose care is less for himself than for the helpless little ones he leaves behind.\n\n1 Kibla, as is well known, is the name given by the Muhammadans to the point towards which one turns in prayer, such as Mecca, in the case of the Muslims, and Jerusalem in the case of the Jews. The Persian form, Kibla-gah (lit. \"Kibla-place\") is often used in letters to relations older than oneself as a title of respect.\nThird Period. Writings of the Interval which intervened between the Death of the B\u00e1b and the Claim of Beh\u00e1 to be \u201cHe whom God shall manifest\u201d (A.D. 1850\u20131867).\n\nI now turn from the writings of the B\u00e1b and his contemporaries to those of his successors. In considering the latter in connection with the later history of the sect, we perceive the necessity of carefully distinguishing three distinct classes. Firstly, there are the writings of M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1 (Hazrat-i-Ezel), which might be further divided into those written in Baghdad before Beh\u00e1 put forward his claim, while their author still enjoyed the undivided allegiance of all the B\u00e1b\u00eds, and those composed subsequently to the schism, in Cyprus. Considering the very limited number of these writings at present available, it seems unnecessary to observe this distinction, and I shall therefore include them all in one class. Secondly, there are the writings of Beh\u00e1 during the period which preceded his claim to supremacy; and thirdly, those of that which succeeded it. The first and second of these classes, which we may call \u201cwritings of the Interval,\u201d I shall consider here, leaving the third class till the end.\n\nI. Writings of Mirz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1 (Hazrat-i-Ezel).\n\nThese need not detain us long. I have already stated that I met very few Ezel\u00eds in Persia, and that I was unable to obtain any of M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1\u2019s works, which are of course accounted as worse than worthless by the Beh\u00e1\u2019\u00eds, i.e. by the vast majority of the B\u00e1b\u00eds. Gobineau says (op. cit. p. 312), \u201cHis Highness the Eternal\u201d (i.e. Hazrat i-Ezel) \u201chas also composed a certain number of works; amongst these, that which is most appreciated by the B\u00e1b\u00eds is the Book of Light.\u201d Although I several times heard mention of this \u201cBook of Light\u201d (Kit\u00e1b-u\u2019n-N\u00fbr) amongst the B\u00e1b\u00eds, I never succeeded in seeing it, or obtaining any information about its contents. The lacuna thus left in my knowledge caused me much regret until recently, when my attention was drawn to an excellent\narticle in the *Journal Asiatique* for 1887 (viii. s\u00e9rie, vol. x.), by M. Cl\u00e9ment Huart, which contains a description of three B\u00e1b\u00ed MSS. which had come under the writer\u2019s observation.\n\nThe first of these M. Huart identifies with the \u201cBook of Light\u201d described by Gobineau, and indeed the title of it, which he quotes, seems to establish this identity with certainty. There appears, however, to be some discrepancy between the size of this small MS. of 63 pages each comprising 19 lines, and that of the thick folio work described as the \u201cBook of Light\u201d by Gobineau. It is unfortunate that M. Huart subsequently terms this same work the \u201cKur\u2019\u00e1n of the B\u00e1b,\u201d and describes it as the \u201cfundamental work of the new doctrine, concerning which its author said to the \u2018ulam\u00e1 of Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, \u2018Take my Kur\u2019\u00e1n, and compare it with that of your prophet, and you will be convinced that mine is more eloquently written than yours, and that my belief is preferable to the religion of Muhammad.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor first of all, the term \u201cKur\u2019\u00e1n of the B\u00e1b,\u201d or \u201cB\u00e1b\u00ed Kur\u2019\u00e1n,\u201d\u00b9 is open to objection. It is only used loosely in the sense of \u201cthe sacred book of the B\u00e1b\u00eds,\u201d just as we might call one of them the \u201cB\u00e1b\u00ed Bible.\u201d For each one of them the B\u00e1b\u00eds have a special name: Bey\u00e1n, Ilk\u00e1n, or Law\u1e25-i-A\u1e33das, etc., as the case may be; it is only the Muhammadans, who do not know one from the other and have no knowledge of their contents, who call them generically the \u201cKur\u2019\u00e1n of the B\u00e1b\u00eds.\u201d Furthermore, the indiscriminate manner in which this term is applied to any of the B\u00e1b\u00ed books of doctrine has resulted in no little confusion. Thus, for instance, the copy of the \u201cCommentary on the S\u00fara-i-Y\u00fasuf\u201d in the British Museum is lettered \u201cB\u00e1b\u00ed Kur\u2019\u00e1n,\u201d while a work which appears to be one of the two Arabic Bey\u00e1ns is described by Dorn by the same title. To apply this name to the \u201cBook of Light\u201d also, is to increase unnecessarily this confusion. Secondly, the latter was not\n\n\u00b9 I regret to say that I myself made use of this term in my first paper, thereby adding to the confusion which I here deplore. What I meant by using it was that if the chief work of the B\u00e1b\u00eds of to-day (i.e. the Beh\u00e1\u2019\u00eds) were to be described as their Kur\u2019\u00e1n, then the Lauch-i-A\u1e33das was most worthy of this title.\ncomposed by the B\u00e1b at all, nor, so far as we know, was it put forward by its author, who is clearly proved by M. Huart to be M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1, as a rival to the Kur\u2019\u00e1n; neither is it at all likely that M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1 visited Sh\u00edr\u00e1z at any period of his life. M. Huart, however, corrects Dorn\u2019s mistake, and identifies the work described by him as one of the Bey\u00e1ns.\n\nThe second work described by M. Huart comprises 26 chapters called R\u00fah (spirit), each of which, with the exception of the 22nd and 24th, has a special title. M. Huart shows that these too are the work of Hazrat-i-Ezel.\n\nThe third volume contains a number of letters (alw\u00e1d\u00ed) written by Hazrat-i-Ezel to his disciples and followers, as is explicitly stated at the commencement of one, the text of which is published, with a translation, by M. Huart, who adds that \u201cothers emanate from certain personages designated by conventional formul\u00e6, whom it would only be possible to indicate more clearly if one were in possession of the entire key to these denominations.\u201d Three of the latter are quoted, viz. Al-wajh (\u201cThe Face\u201d), Bey\u00e1nu\u2019ll-\u2018adl (\u201cThe Explanation of Justice\u201d), and Shajaratu\u2019ll-\u2018Am\u00e1, which M. Huart translates \u201cThe Tree of Blindness\u201d (\u201cL\u2019Arbre de l\u2019aveuglement\u201d), but which I should rather render by \u201cThe tree of the (Divine) Mystery.\u201d\n\nI would merely suggest as a conjecture that all these terms may indicate the same person, viz. Hazrat-i-Ezel, just as the B\u00e1b has several titles such as Nukta-i-Bey\u00e1n, Nukta-i-U\u2019l\u00e1, Hazrat-i-A\u2019l\u00e1, etc. It is true that all the \u201cletters of the Living\u201d enjoyed similar titles,\n\n---\n\n1 Journal Asiatique (1887), viii. s\u00e9rie, vol. x. p. 135, note 2.\n2 The word \u2018Am\u00e1 is used in this sense by the Suf\u00eds commonly. See Jorj\u00e1n\u00ed\u2019s \u201cDefinitions,\u201d ed. Fl\u00fcgel, p. 163, where it is defined as \u201cthe degree of primal unity\u201d (martabatu\u2019ll-ahadiyyat), by which is generally understood by Suf\u00ed writers that degree or plane wherein God is regarded as one absolutely, not relatively to plurality; and where plurality is not even potential, as it is in the \u201cDegree of Unity\u201d (Martabatu\u2019ll-Wahidiyyat), where the \u201cFixed Exemplars\u201d (A\u2019yan-i-Th\u00e1bita) are existent in the mind of God. The first is the \u201cStation of the Essence\u201d (Mak\u00e1m-i-Z\u00e1t); the second the \u201cStation of the Attributes\u201d (Mak\u00e1m-i-Sif\u00e1t). For this sense of \u2018Am\u00e1 consult also Lane\u2019s Arabic English Lexicon, s.v. \u2018Am\u00e1, book i. part v. p. 2161, where the tradition from which this use of it is borrowed is discussed.\n3 Or perhaps Beh\u00e1 may be intended by one of these titles, since he calls himself Al-wajh (the Face) in several passages of his writings. See below, pp. 967, 969.\nbut their relative inferiority to the chief of the sect is generally marked by the prefix being Jen\u00e1b instead of Hazrat; e.g. \u1e32urratu'l-'Ayn is called Jen\u00e1b-i-T\u00e1hir\u00e1; Mull\u00e1 Huseyn of Bushraweyh Jen\u00e1b-i-B\u00e1b\u00fa'l-B\u00e1b; H\u00e1j\u00ed Mull\u00e1 Muhammad 'Al\u00ed is Jen\u00e1b-i-Kudd\u00fas; and similarly we read of Jen\u00e1b-i-Mukaddas in the B\u00e1b\u00ed history, and Gobineau speaks of M\u00edrz\u00e1 Asadu'll\u00e1h of Tabr\u00edz surnamed Deyy\u00e1n. In short it would appear as though names indicating the Divine Essence were originally bestowed only on the chief of the sect, while those given to the other members of the \"Unity\" indicated only the Attributes. For these reasons it appears to me probable that M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1 (Hazrat-i-Ezel) is the author of all the letters described by M. Huart. As I can add nothing more about the Ezel\u00ed writings, I will pass on to those of Beh\u00e1, referring those who desire fuller information to M. Huart's valuable article, which fills a most important gap in our knowledge of the B\u00e1b\u00ed literature. M. Huart holds out some hopes of publishing these MSS., at any rate in part, and it is greatly to be hoped that he may carry out this intention.\n\nII. Writings of Beh\u00e1 during the 'Interval.'\n\nAlthough I have already described the state of affairs amongst the B\u00e1bis during the period which separated the death of the B\u00e1b from the claim of Beh\u00e1 to be \"He whom God shall manifest,\" I think that it may not be amiss to quote in translation that part of the article on the B\u00e1bis in the Arabic Encyclop\u00e6dia called D\u00e1'iratu'l-Ma'\u00e1rif which sums it up in a few well-chosen words. After relating the martyrdom of the B\u00e1b and the fierce persecution of his followers in A.D. 1852, the article proceeds as follows:\n\n\"Now this man (i.e. the B\u00e1b) had hinted in some of his writings that he who should succeed him after his death was a youth amongst his disciples named Yahy\u00e1, and entitled \u1e62ub\u1e25-i-Ezel (\"The Morning of Eternity\"). And when the severities of the Sh\u00e1hi against them occurred, and he pur-\n\n1 See Appendix II, \u00a7 2.\nsued them with slaughter in all places, many of them fled to Baghdad in the territory of the Sublime State (i.e. the Ottoman Government). And of those who came out (from Persia) thus, were Yahy\u00e1, '\u015eubh-i-Ezel,' and his elder brother named M\u00edrz\u00e1 Huseyn 'Al\u00ed and entitled 'Beh\u00e1.' And \u015eubh-i-Ezel hid himself from the eyes of men at the command of his brother, and his brother pretended that he (i.e. M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1) was present amongst men, but that they did not behold him because their eyes were not fit to look upon him. And when it fell out that the Sublime State (the Ottoman Government) and the State of the Sh\u00e1h (Persia) agreed to expel them from Baghdad, and the Government transferred them to Adrianople, \u015eubh-i-Ezel came forth and showed himself unto men, exercising the authority of vicegerency, and inviting (men) unto the religion of his master, the Seyy\u00edd 'Al\u00ed (Muhammad, i.e. the B\u00e1b). And his brother envied him, and repudiated him, and asserted that he was Antichrist, and a schism occurred between them, and (their) followers were separated into two parties: one party followed \u015eubh-i-Ezel, and the other Beh\u00e1, and the former are called 'Ezel\u00eds,' and the latter 'Beh\u00e1'\u00eds,' while 'B\u00e1b\u00eds' is a term for both in common. And after a while the Sublime State (the Ottoman Government) perceived evil designs in them, and detected mischief amongst them, so it exiled \u015eubh-i-Ezel to the island of Cyprus, and there he died.\u00b9 And Beh\u00e1 it exiled to 'Akk\u00e1 (Acre), where he is now, with a number of his followers.\"\n\nThis account entirely agrees with what I have heard from the B\u00e1b\u00eds of the relative positions of Beh\u00e1 and Ezel at Baghdad. The latter remained for the most part secluded from the eyes of men, while the business of interviewing disciples and inquirers and carrying on correspondence with the B\u00e1b\u00eds in Persia was chiefly undertaken by Beh\u00e1, although at this time he acted merely on behalf of Ezel. Indeed, it would appear that even at this time he was regarded by the enemies of the B\u00e1b\u00eds as the chief of the sect,\n\n\u00b9 This is a mistake. See Appendix II. \u00a7 2.\nand that consequently it was against him that their proceedings were chiefly directed. It is not easy to form a clear idea of the light in which he regarded himself while thus acting in the name of the nominal chief, Ezel; to do this it will be necessary to collect and study his earlier letters and writings, if such can be found. For the present I shall only notice his chief work during the period of the 'Interval,' about the date of the composition of which there is no doubt. This is the *I\u1e25k\u0101n* (Assurance) of which I spoke in my last paper, and which I described as a proof of the truth of the B\u00e1b\u00ed doctrines and the divine inspiration of their Founder, supported by arguments drawn from the Pentateuch, Gospel, Kur'\u00e1n, and Traditions. Of its contents it is unnecessary for me to speak more fully at present, firstly because I included the general purport of its argument in a former paragraph while discussing the work called *D\u0101li'il-i-Sab'a* (The Seven Proofs); secondly, because Baron Rosen has already published a detailed account of it, with copious extracts, to which I refer those who desire fuller information. Beyond repeating that it is composed in Persian, and is eagerly read and highly esteemed by the B\u00e1b\u00eds, I will only notice the following points about it:\n\n(1) Except a small tract in Persian called *Muduniyyat* (Civilization), which does not deal directly with religious questions, the *I\u1e25k\u0101n* is, so far as I am aware, the only one of their books which the B\u00e1b\u00eds have published. It was lithographed, I think in India, and much care was bestowed on its execution. It is not sold openly, all copies being in the hands of influential B\u00e1b\u00eds, who give them away to those who desire them and can be trusted with them. Manuscripts of the work are also commonly met with; Baron Rosen states that he possesses a copy, besides the one which exists in the Library of the Institut des Langues Orientales at St. Petersburg; another is to be found amongst the MSS. of the British Museum, numbered Or. 3116; and I have already stated that the first B\u00e1b\u00ed book which I\n\n---\n\n1 Collections Scientifiques de l'Institut des Langues Orientales, vol. iii. Manuscrits Persans, St. Petersburg, 1886, p. 33\u201351.\nsucceeded in obtaining in Persia was a MS of this work. Almost every B\u00e1b\u00ed who possesses any books at all has a copy of it, and from its pages their arguments are for the most part drawn.\n\n(2) The date of its composition is thus mentioned in the body of the text: \"H\u00e1l haz\u00e1r \u00fa divist \u00fa haft\u00e1d (\u00fa) hasht sen\u00e9 az zah\u00far-i-Nukta-i-Furk\u00e1n gu\u017easht, va jam\u00ed\u2018 i-in hamaj-i-ra\u2018\u00e1\u2018 dar hur \u015fab\u00e1h talivat-i-Kur\u2018\u00e1n namul\u00e9-and, va han\u00faz bi-harfi az maks\u00fal-i-\u00e1n fa\u2018iz na-shud\u00e9 . . .\" \"One thousand two hundred and seventy-eight years have passed since the manifestation of the 'Point of the Furk\u00e1n' (i.e. Muhammad, who is so called in correspondence with the title 'Point of the Bey\u00e1n' applied to the B\u00e1b), and all of these worthless wretches have read the Kur\u2018\u00e1n every morning, and have not yet attained to a single letter of the purport thereof.\" It will be remembered that the B\u00e1b is very fond of dating not from the hijra, but from the bi\u2018\u015fat (mission) of Muhammad, which he places ten years earlier; and this fact might make us uncertain whether the same method may not be employed in this passage, and the year A.H. 1268 (A.D. 1852) be intended rather than the year A.H. 1278 (A.D. 1861\u201362). We have, however, no reason for supposing that Beh\u00e1 imitated the B\u00e1b in this; and since A.H. 1268 was the year of the attempt on the Sh\u00e1h\u2019s life, and the great persecution of the B\u00e1bis which resulted therefrom, and since, moreover, during the last three or four months of it, Beh\u00e1 was confined in prison at Teher\u00e1n, and the exodus of the B\u00e1bis from Persia to Baghdad did not occur till A.H. 1269 (A.D. 1853), while in the I\u2018k\u00e1n Baghdad is referred to in at least two passages as being the head-quarters of the chief of the sect, it seems quite certain that it was in A.H. 1278, and not in A.H. 1268, that the latter work was composed.\n\n(3) The conclusion of the book is important as casting a certain amount of light on the relations of its author, Beh\u00e1, with other members of the sect at this period. Six pages from the end an appeal is made to the \"\u2018Ulam\u00e1 of the\n\n---\n\n1 Journ. Roy. Asiat. Soc. Vol. XXI. p. 507.\nBey\u00e1n\u201d not to behave like the Muhammadans, and to refrain from persecuting and rejecting the promised \u201cMusta-gh\u00e1s,\u201d whose advent they are expecting, when he appears. After repeating the same injunction in other words on the following page, the author proceeds to speak briefly of the hostility shown towards himself (whom he denotes as in \u2018abd, \u201cthis servant\u201d) by some of the B\u00e1bis, adding these words: \u201cB\u00e1 in-ki b\u00e1 ahadi dar amri iftikh\u00e1r na-nam\u00fadam, va ba-nafsi bartari na-justam; ma\u2018 har nafsi mu\u015f\u00e1hibi b\u00fadam dar nih\u00e1yat-i-mihrb\u00e1n\u00ed, va bi-gh\u00e1yat burdb\u00e1r \u00fa r\u00e1yag\u00e1n, va b\u00e1 fu\u015far\u00e1 mi\u015fl-i-fu\u015far\u00e1 b\u00fadam, va b\u00e1 \u2018ulam\u00e1 va \u2018uz\u00e1m\u00e1 dar kam\u00e1l-i-taslim \u00fa ri\u0163\u00e1,\u201d \u201cAlthough I never exalted myself over any one in any matter, nor sought for authority over any one; I associated with every one with the utmost affection, and (was) extremely patient and accessible, and with the poor was as the poor, and with the learned and great (I was) perfectly submissive and contented.\u201d He then declares that all the cruelty and tyranny of his open foes is far easier to bear than the envy and malice of pretended friends, and proceeds to describe how, on his \u201cfirst arrival in this land\u201d (i.e. Baghdad) he withdrew for two years into the wilderness by himself, intending to remain there all his life, since his only desire was to avoid being a cause of dissension and strife amongst the believers. His reason for altering this resolution was that \u201cthe order to return emanated from the source of command,\u201d which clearly shows us that at this date (A.D. 1861\u20131862) Beh\u00e1 still recognized Ezel as his chief, and submitted to his authority, at least nominally. After declaring that \u201cthe pen is powerless to portray\u201d what he has experienced since his return to Baghdad, and that for two years his enemies have been\n\n---\n\n1 We learn from Nabil\u2019s chronological poem that Beh\u00e1 arrived at Baghdad when he was 37 years old, i.e. in A.H. 1270 (since he was born in A.H. 1233), and that when he was 38 years old (i.e. in A.H. 1271 = A.D. 1854\u201355) he \u201cwithdrew from mankind\u201d (ghaybat az khalk nam\u00fad) until he was 40, when he returned to Zawr\u00e1 (i.e. Baghdad). This is evidently the \u201cfour years of retirement\u201d here alluded to. His return therefore occurred in A.H. 1273 (A.D. 1856\u201357), five years before the publication of the Ik\u00e1n.\n\n2 In the original \u201caz ma\u015fdar-i-amr hukm-i-ruj\u00fa\u2018 \u015fadir shud, va l\u0101 budd taslim nam\u00fadam va r\u00faji\u2018 shudam.\u201d\nseeking to destroy him, while assistance and sympathy were withheld by those from whom he had the best right to expect such, he adds that, were it not that he is not only ready but anxious to yield up his life \"in the way of the Nuk\u1e6da\" (i.e. the B\u00e1b), he would assuredly not remain in Baghdad for a single moment. Although these details which Beh\u00e1 gives us about himself in the \u00cdk\u00e1n only occupy a few paragraphs, they are sufficient to enable us to form a fairly clear idea of his position at the time he wrote it, which is the more valuable because we know precisely the date of its composition. To recapitulate briefly the most important facts which we learn from them: Beh\u00e1 at this time admitted the supremacy of Ezel, and arrogated to himself no superiority over his comrades, but at the same time he appears to have aroused the envy and hostility of some of the latter, besides having attracted the special attention of the enemies of the new religion. The latter facts may suggest to us the question whether Beh\u00e1 did not even at this time really occupy a more prominent position than his own words would seem to imply; while the repeated exhortation to the \"people of the Bey\u00e1n\" not to reject the promised Mustagh\u00e1s when he appeared renders the supposition that he already contemplated the idea of putting forward this claim himself not wholly improbable.\n\n(4) The colophon with which the \u00cdk\u00e1n closes deserves notice. It runs as follows: \"Al-munzal\u00fa min al-B\u00e1 wa 'l-H\u00e1, wa's-sal\u00e1mu '\u00e1l\u00e1 man sami'a naghmata 'l-wark\u00e1 fi sidrati 'l-muntah\u00e1 fu-subh\u00e1na Rabbana 'l-A'l\u00e1,\" \"Revealed from the B. and the H.\" (i.e. Beh\u00e1) \"and peace (be) upon whomsoever heareth the song of the dove on the lote-tree beyond which there is no passing;\"\u00b9 and glory (be) to our Lord the Most High.\"\n\nThe expression munzal (\"revealed,\" \"sent down\") is remarkable, since we have seen that Beh\u00e1 at this date asserted that he \"claimed no authority over any one,\" which statement could scarcely be put forward if he intended the work\n\n\u00b9 See Kur\u2019\u00e1n liii. (S\u00faratu\u2019n-najm), v. 14, and Sale\u2019s translation, p. 390, note.\nin which it occurs to be regarded in the light of a revelation. I therefore think it most probable that the colophon was added at a later date, after Beh\u00e1\u2019s claim had been put forward and accepted by the majority of the B\u00e1b\u00eds, and when all his writings (including, probably, those composed at a date previous to this claim) were regarded by his followers as inspired. The point can only be settled definitely when a copy of the \u00cdk\u00e1n written previously to this date (i.e. before A.H. 1283, A.D. 1866\u201367) can be obtained and examined. The British Museum MS. ends with the same colophon, except that al-manz\u00fal is written instead of al-munzal.\n\nTo these remarks on the \u00cdk\u00e1n I will only add that it is a work of great merit, vigorous in style, clear in argument, cogent in proof, and displaying no slight knowledge of the Bible, Kur\u2019\u00e1n, and Traditions on the part of the writer. It fully deserves the high estimation in which it is held by the B\u00e1b\u00eds.\n\nFourth Period. Writings of Beh\u00e1 Composed After His Claim to Be \u201cHe Whom God Shall Manifest.\u201d\n\nIn the year A.H. 1283 (A.D. 1866\u201367), two years after the transference of the B\u00e1b\u00eds from Baghdad to Adrianople, Beh\u00e1, then in his fiftieth year, openly declared his divine mission, and called upon all the B\u00e1b\u00eds, including Ezel, to acknowledge the same. From this point dates the schism which to this day divides the B\u00e1b\u00eds into Beh\u00e1\u2019\u00eds and Ezelis, and henceforth the writings of Beh\u00e1 breathe a spirit altogether different from that which pervades the \u00cdk\u00e1n.\n\nThe works of the B\u00e1b are, as has been already shown, voluminous though not very numerous. The Persian Bey\u00e1n and the Commentary on the S\u00fara-i-Y\u00fasuf, as well as the longer Arabic Bey\u00e1n, are books of considerable bulk. On the other hand, the total number of separate treatises composed by him (at least of those with which we are at present acquainted) does not exceed, even if it reaches, a dozen.\n\nOf the works of Beh\u00e1 exactly the opposite may be said. They consist of numerous letters and treatises, all, so far as I know, of comparative brevity, the longest and most com-\nplete being the *La\u1e6d\u1e25-i-A\u1e33\u1e0das* which I shall discuss shortly. All letters emanating from Beh\u00e1' are regarded as revelations by his followers, who carefully preserve and diligently copy them. In my last paper I described how the B\u00e1b\u00ed couriers visit Persia yearly, bearing with them a number of these *alw\u00e1\u1e25* (epistles) addressed to believers in the different towns. To receive one of these, even of only a few lines, is accounted a very great honour: the favoured recipient exhibits the treasured scrap of paper to his friends and co-religionists, who, after kissing it, and placing their foreheads on it, proceed eagerly to peruse it, and, if possible, obtain leave from the owner to take a copy of it for themselves. The number of these *alw\u00e1\u1e25* is therefore practically unlimited, and collections of them frequently occur amongst B\u00e1b\u00ed MSS.\n\nAs these generally consist only of a few words of encouragement and exhortation, and as, without a knowledge of the circumstances and date of their composition and of the persons to whom they were addressed (which knowledge could scarcely be obtained otherwise than by careful inquiries amongst the B\u00e1bis at Acre) little can be deduced from them, I shall at present limit myself to a consideration of a few of the longer and more important treatises and epistles of Beh\u00e1', and for the purpose of illustration shall choose for discussion the *La\u1e6d\u1e25-i-Na\u1e63ir*, which appears to be the earliest of his writings wherein he distinctly and uncompromisingly puts forward his claims; the *Alw\u00e1\u1e25-i-Sal\u0101\u1e6d\u012bn* (Letters of the Kings), wherein he summons the rulers of various countries to believe in him and accept his religion; and the *La\u1e6d\u1e25-i-A\u1e33\u1e0das*, which, containing as it does in a codified form the prescriptions of the new faith as revised and remodelled by Beh\u00e1', is the most important of all.\n\n1. *The 'La\u1e6d\u1e25-i-Na\u1e63ir.'*\n\nThis is an epistle of 73 pages of small size, addressed to some B\u00e1b\u00ed called Na\u1e63ir, who appears to have been favourably\n\n---\n\n1 One such collection occurs in the British Museum MS. marked Or. 3114, and another at the end of Or. 3116, the first part of which contains the *\u012ak\u0101n*.\ndisposed towards Beh\u00e1, but to have had some difficulties in admitting the claims then recently advanced by the latter. These difficulties he had apparently set forth in a letter, to which this is a reply. A copy of this I obtained at Kirm\u00e1n by the advice and through the kindness of some of my B\u00e1b\u00ed friends there, who considered it as an important document which I ought to possess. I know of no other copy in Europe. It is for the most part written in Persian, with occasional passages in Arabic. I shall confine myself to noticing briefly some of the more important points in it.\n\nAfter the exordium, the letter proper commences thus: \"Ey Na\u1e63ir! Ey \u2018abd-i-man!\" \"O Na\u1e63ir! O my servant.\" This mode of address already marks a great change from the tone adopted by Beh\u00e1 in the I\u1e33\u00e1n, where he declares that he \"never sought supremacy over any one.\" A little further on he proceeds, \"N\u00e1m\u00e9-i-t\u00fa bi-makarr-i-kuds v\u00e1rid \u00e1mad,\" \"Thy letter arrived at the Place of Holiness;\" and shortly after he says, \"B\u00e1b-i-fa\u017cl maft\u016bh, vu t\u00fa ma\u2019m\u00far bi-dukh\u00fat,\" \"The door of grace is open, and thou art commanded to enter.\"\n\nThat this letter was addressed to one named Na\u1e63ir appears from the above, and two or three other passages where the name of Beh\u00e1's correspondent is mentioned. That it was written by Beh\u00e1 is also evident, apart from the style and substance of the document, from two passages, one of which begins, \"L\u00e1 fa-wa-nafsiya \u2019l-Beh\u00e1!\" \"No, by myself the Beh\u00e1!\" and the other of which runs as follows: \"Wa law yak\u00famu ahadun \u2018al\u00e1 \u1e25ubbi-\u2019l-Beh\u00e1 fi ardhi \u2019l-insh\u00e1 wa yulj\u00e1ribu ma\u2019ahu kulla man fi\u2019l-ardhi wa\u2019s-sem\u00e1 la-yug\u1e25libuhu \u2019ll\u00e1hu if any one understood the love of Beh\u00e1 in the earth of \"And \u2018aleyhim idhh\u00e1ran li-kudratih\u00ed, wa ibr\u00e1zan li-saltanatih\u00ed,\" creation, and were to fight on his side against all who are in the earth and the heavens, God would verily make him victorious over them, as a showing forth of His power, and a setting forth of His majesty.\"\n\nThat the letter was composed after Beh\u00e1 had put forward his claim is also manifest not only from the passages I have quoted, but from many others, and indeed from the whole\ntenour of the letter. That it was written shortly after this is also evident from the strong opposition to his claims by the majority of the \"people of the Bey\u00e1n\" (i.e. the B\u00e1bis) of which Beh\u00e1 complains, and for which he censures them, which opposition appears rapidly to have subsided until his rival, Ezel, only retained a mere handful of followers. In only one passage is anything approaching a definite date given, and in it Beh\u00e1 speaks thus:\u2014\"O people of the Bey\u00e1n! have you not considered that for twenty years he\"\u2014(Beh\u00e1 is here speaking of himself in the third person)\u2014\"has stood up by himself against the enemies? Many are the nights when all were sleeping at ease on their beds, while this Beauty of Primal Unity (Jem\u00e1l-i-Ahadiyyat) was standing up openly against the unbelievers (mushrikin), and many the days when the Beauty of Glory and Dignity (Jem\u00e1l-i-'izz \u00fa tamkin) was evident and resplendent and obvious amongst the unbelievers, while ye kept yourselves preserved and concealed in hiding-places, fearing for yourselves.\" Now Beh\u00e1 must have been one of the first to believe in the B\u00e1b: we learn from the B\u00e1bi history that he was amongst those who met the latter at a place called Kh\u00e1nlik near Teher\u00e1n as he was being conveyed to Tabr\u00edz from Isfah\u00e1n, which was in the year A.H. 1263 (A.D. 1847). As we have seen, Beh\u00e1's claim was put forward in A.H. 1283 (A.D. 1866-67), exactly twenty years later. From this we may fairly assume that the Lawh-i-Na\u1e63\u00edr was written very soon after that event, probably in the same year, which conclusion agrees with the statement made to me by the B\u00e1bis at Kirm\u00e1n.\n\nIt remains for me to notice the nature of the claim therein set forth, which is of the utmost possible magnitude, and stated in the most uncompromising manner, though differently expressed in different passages. These differences, however, are only of aspect, depending on the B\u00e1bi views concerning the unity of the essential principle which speaks through all the prophets. Thus in one passage Beh\u00e1 says, \"Kull-i-kutub-i-samari bi-lis\u00e1n-i-jalil-i-kudrat n\u00e1\u017eil farm\u00fadam\"\u2014\"I revealed all the heavenly books by the glorious tongue\" (or, 'in the glorious language') \"of (Divine) Might.\" In\nanother place he calls himself \"Malik-i-Sif\u00e1t,\" \"The Lord of the Attributes\" (meaning thereby that he is the Divine Essence made manifest), and reproves those who are \"veiled by the Names\" from the Essence, mentioning especially one (probably M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1, \"Hazrat-i-Ezel\") whom he calls \"a Name amongst my Names,\" whom I created by a single letter, and to whom I gave life by a single breath,\" and who nevertheless \"arose in war against\" his \"Beauty.\" In other passages, again, he declares that he is the Nukta-i-U'l\u00e1 (\"The First Point,\" i.e. the B\u00e1b) returned again, and this manner of speaking he carries so far as to talk of the execution of the B\u00e1b at Tabr\u00edz as one of his own experiences, as in the following remarkable passage:\n\n\"It hath been witnessed what an amount of cruelty and perversity was shown by the people of error, so that none can reckon it but God: until at length they suspended my glorious body in the air, and wounded it with the bullets of malice and hatred, until my spirit returned to the Supreme Companion (Rafik-i-A'l\u00e1), and gazed on the Most Beauteous Garment (Kami\u015f-i-Abh\u00e1). And not one reflected wherefore it was that I accepted this injury from my own servants, for, had they reflected, they would not have remained veiled from my Beauty in my second manifestation by reason of a Name amongst my Names.\" Again, in another passage, he says, \"In the Bey\u00e1n I admonished all in the language of power.\" Other similar sayings might be quoted, but I think these are sufficient to establish this point.\n\nMany valuable pieces of information can be gleaned from this epistle, since it is less formal and didactic than Beh\u00e1's later writings. Thus he quotes several passages from the B\u00e1b's works, and mentions some of the latter by name, distinctly stating, for example, that the names A\u1e25sanu'l-Ki\u1e63\u0101s and Kayy\u00fam-i-Asm\u00e1 apply to the same book. As the\n\n1 I need hardly repeat that the 18 \"Letters of the Living\" which constituted, with the \"Point,\" the B\u00e1b\u00ed hierarchy, and amongst whom Ezel was included, were regarded as incarnations, or \"manifestations,\" of the chief Attributes or \"Names\" of God, while the \"Point\" was a manifestation of the Essence. Beh\u00e1 claims to be the \"Point,\" and complains that one of his own \"Names\" should attempt to conceal him.\nformer of these terms is that whereby the Commentary on the S\u00fara-i-Y\u00fasuf is generally denoted amongst the B\u00e1b\u00eds, we learn where we must look for a passage stated in the Ik\u00e1n to occur in the \u1e32ayy\u00fam-i-Asm\u00e1, the importance of locating which Baron Rosen has pointed out.\\(^1\\) This same passage quoted in the Ik\u00e1n is also cited in the B\u00e1b\u00ed history, as I have mentioned in referring to it in a former part of this paper.\\(^2\\) Some information about persons who played a more or less important part in helping or opposing the B\u00e1b\u00ed cause, such as Mull\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed B\u00edst\u00e1mi amongst the former, and one of the Muhammadan \u2018ulam\u00e1 called Muhammad Hasan Najafi amongst the latter, is also given. The second of these individuals is probably the same as the \u201cSheyk\u201d who is named as Muhammad before Hasan,\u201d against whom a passage in the Lawh-i-A\u1e33das is directed. I must now leave the Lawh-i-Na\u1e63ir, which concludes with a warning to Na\u1e63ir that one will shortly appear before him and try to turn his heart from the love of Beh\u00e1, but that he is to \u201cbe sure that he is a devil, even if he be the highest of men.\u201d It is probable that Beh\u00e1 here alludes to some Ezel\u00ed missionary who was engaged in trying to prevent the B\u00e1b\u00eds from accepting Beh\u00e1\u2019s claim and in consequence rejecting Ha\u1e93rat-i-Ezel.\n\n2. The \u2018Alv\u00e1h-i-Sal\u00e1\u1e6din (Letters of the Kings).\n\nIn my last paper I alluded to and enumerated the Letters sent by Beh\u00e1 to the Rulers of the chief countries in Europe and Western Asia, and promised to describe their contents more fully on a future occasion. I regret that the length which the present article has already attained forbids me from discussing them as fully as the great interest of their contents would impel me to do did the space at my disposal allow of it. For the present I must limit myself to\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Collections de l\u2019Institut, etc., vol. iii.

Taken collectively, these letters constitute what is known amongst the B\u00e1b\u00eds as the S\u00fara-i-Heykal, which I think includes also some shorter letters addressed to sundry other people. The only text in my possession forms part of a MS. obtained at Kirm\u00e1n, which also includes the Law\u1e25-i-A\u1e33das, as well as a tarji\u02bfband in praise of Beh\u00e1. In this are contained: (1) the letter to N\u00e1siru\u2019d-D\u00edn Sh\u00e1h, King of Persia; (2) the letter entitled Law\u1e25-i-Ra\u02beis, addressed apparently to one of the Turkish ministers (probably \u2018Al\u00ed P\u00e1sh\u00e1, but of the identity of the Law\u1e25-i-\u2018Al\u00ed P\u00e1sh\u00e1 with that at present under consideration I am not certain); (3) the letter to the Pope of Rome; (4) the letter to the \u201cKing of Paris\u201d (i.e. Napoleon III.); (5) the letter to the then-reigning Emperor of Russia; besides these there is (6) the letter to Queen Victoria, of which, as it was not included in the Kirm\u00e1n MS., I recently obtained a copy through the kindness of one of my friends at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z. I am almost certain that a letter to the late Sult\u00e1n \u2018Abdu\u2019l-\u2018Az\u00edz also exists, but of this I have unfortunately no copy. Most of these letters appear to have been written about the same time, viz. soon after the arrival of Beh\u00e1 at Acre (A.H. 1285\u201386, A.D. 1868\u201369), but the Law\u1e25-i-Ra\u02be\u00eds must be placed later.\n\na. Letter to the Sh\u00e1h of Persia.\n\nBefore proceeding to speak of this letter in detail, it is right that I should mention a difficulty which I am at present unable to solve. Near the beginning of my paper I spoke of Baron Rosen\u2019s description of a MS. in the St. Petersburg collection containing a long letter addressed collectively to the Sh\u00e1h of Persia, the \u201cChristian Kings\u201d (Mul\u016bku\u2019l-Mas\u012b\u1e25iyya), and certain officials (r\u016bkal\u0101), particularly the French and Persian Consuls at Baghdad. When I first read this description I had no doubt that Beh\u00e1 was the writer of the letter in question, but a further examination of it and a comparison between its style and tone and\nthose of the Letter to the Sh\u00e1h which I am about to describe, render this supposition difficult.\n\nThe letter of which I possess a copy I have compared with another copy in the British Museum marked Or. 3115, with which, apart from a few various readings, it agrees. It is partly in Arabic, partly in Persian, and is characterized by extreme moderation of tone. The blame of persecuting the B\u00e1bis is chiefly laid on the \u2018Ulam\u00e1, who, it is alleged, have instigated and maintained these persecutions by false representations to the Sh\u00e1h. The writer declares that he has always been a loyal subject of the King, obedient to his commands, and desirous of his welfare, in proof of which he points out that since he was released from his imprisonment at Teher\u00e1n on the establishment of his innocence of any complicity in the attempt on the Sh\u00e1h\u2019s life (which attempt Beh\u00e1, in all his writings where he alludes to it, strongly condemns), no act of sedition has emanated from the B\u00e1bis, and that this submissiveness on their part, contrasting strongly with their former conduct, is in great measure due to his (the writer\u2019s) influence.\n\nThe letter described by Baron Rosen, which is entirely in Arabic, not only does not contain a single passage corresponding with the above, but differs from it widely both in style and tone. The style appears to me very inferior (at any rate as regards accuracy) to that of Beh\u00e1, and it contains, as Baron Rosen observes, numerous grammatical errors. The tone it adopts towards the Sh\u00e1h is one of fierce recrimination: the writer, after upbraiding him for putting the B\u00e1b to death, says,\u00b9 \u201cAnd would that you had slain him as men slay one another, but you slew him in such wise that the eyes of men have not seen the like thereof, and Heaven wept over him, and the hearts of those near (to God) cried out. Was he not the son of your Prophet, and was not his relationship to the Prophet well known amongst you? How then did you do unto him that which none of the former ones have done? By God! the eye of existence hath not beheld the\n\n\u00b9 Rosen, MSS. Arabes, p. 199.\nlike of you: you slay the son of your Prophet and then rejoice in your places, and are of those who are joyful. And you curse those who were aforetime, who did the like of what ye have done, while ye are careless of yourselves.\u201d A few sentences further on the writer proceeds to excuse, if not to approve, the attempt on the Sh\u00e1h\u2019s life as follows:\u2014\u201cAnd when ye slew him, one from amongst his friends arose in retaliation, and none knew him, and his purpose was concealed from whatever hath life. . . Then it is not meet that you should blame any one for this, but rather blame yourselves for what you have done, if ye be just.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the particulars which we glean from a perusal of both letters correspond in the main is not a proof that their authors were identical, for the exodus from Teher\u00e1n to Baghdad, and the proceedings eventually taken at the latter place against the B\u00e1bis included them all alike. Again, if both letters had been written by Beh\u00e1 at different times, we should have expected some allusion to be made in one of them to the former one, which is not the case. On the contrary, Beh\u00e1, in the letter which is undoubtedly his, and which was written from Adrianople after it had been decided by the Turkish Government to send him to Acre, particularly says that he had not previously appealed directly to the Sh\u00e1h, but only to one of his ministers named M\u00edrz\u00e1 Sa\u2018\u00edd Kh\u00e1n. He also says that he had not written or communicated with any foreign states. This, I think, conclusively proves that the document described by Baron Rosen cannot have been written before the one which is included in the S\u00fara-i-Heykal, supposing Beh\u00e1 to be the author of the former. If we could overlook the difference of style, we might, however, suppose the reverse of this, viz. that the letter in the S\u00fara-i-Heykal was first written, and that the change in tone observable in the other was caused by disappointment or anger at the neglect shown to the preceding missive. But when we recall the fate which befell the bearer of Bch\u00e1\u2019s letter to the Sh\u00e1h, which is a matter of notoriety in Persia, this hypothesis likewise appears difficult. It was considered desirable that this letter should be sent by\na special messenger, and on the announcement of this, several volunteers stepped forward, from the number of whom a youthful believer, now known amongst the B\u00e1b\u00eds as B\u00e1b\u00ed \u201cthe Wonderful,\u201d was selected. Travelling on foot from Acre to Teher\u00e1n he succeeded, on his arrival at the Persian capital, in delivering his letter to the Sh\u00e1h as the latter was riding through the streets, saying as he did so, \u201cI bring a command (farman) to you.\u201d The Sh\u00e1h, thinking that the sense of awe produced in him by the Royal Presence had bewildered him so that he did not know what he was saying, remarked, \u201cYou mean a petition.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d answered B\u00e1b\u00ed, \u201cI mean what I say: a command from one whose authority is higher than yours.\u201d When the Sh\u00e1h understood whence the letter came, and who the writer was, he ordered B\u00e1b\u00ed to be put to death, which was done by branding him with red-hot bricks. I have heard that as the executioners were lifting up the bricks with iron tongs to apply them to his body, he cried out, \u201cIt is not necessary for you to trouble yourselves: I welcome death in such a cause,\u201d and, seizing the bricks in his own hands, pressed them to his bosom. Amazing as this seems, it finds a parallel in the behaviour of Suleym\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n at his execution in A.D. 1852.\n\nNow if Beh\u00e1 had been, as I at first supposed, the author of this second letter (quoted by Baron Rosen), some allusion would almost certainly have been made in it to so remarkable an event. No such allusion occurs in the notice of its contents. This appears to me almost conclusive evidence that the second letter was not written by Beh\u00e1. In this case its author must have been one of the other B\u00e1b\u00ed chiefs, and the first supposition which would naturally occur to us would be that it was composed by Ezel. This view is supported by the fact that in another letter occurring in the same collection, which is quoted in part by Baron Rosen, we find these words: \u201cAsma\u2018\u00fa nid\u00e1\u2019a \u2019ll\u00e1hi \u2018an h\u00e1dh\u00edhi \u2019sh-shajarat\u00ed \u2019l-mani\u2018ati \u2019l-murtafi\u2018ati \u2019l-mub\u00e1rakati \u2019l-ezeliyyati \u2019l-ahadiyya.\u201d \u201cHear the voice of God from this unapproachable, lofty, blessed, eternal Tree of Unity.\u201d\n\n1 Loc. cit. p. 208.\nAgainst this view of the authorship of the letter is the fact that the writer describes himself\\(^1\\) as \"this servant who is called Huseyn in the Kingdom of names,\" while in another passage he says, \"Say, O people, am I not in truth the son of 'Al\u00ed? but I am named Huseyn in the spiritual world\\(^2\\) of God the Protector, the Mighty, the Kind.\" Inasmuch as the name of Hazrat-i-Ezel was Yahy\u00e1, not Huseyn, these passages would conclusively disprove his authorship of the document in question did it not seem possible that the meaning of the passages quoted is, not that the writer of the letter was called Huseyn in the actual world or \"World of Creation\" ('Alam-i-Mulk), but that he is so called spiritually, because he is the successor of the B\u00e1b, as Huseyn was of 'Al\u00ed. A passage in which he speaks of the B\u00e1b, not as 'Ali Muhammad, but as 'Ali,\\(^3\\) tends to strengthen this view, which, for the rest, is fully in keeping with B\u00e1b\u00ed methods of thought and expression.\n\nTo sum up the results of the foregoing investigation, it appears probable that the letter described by Baron Rosen was written not by Beh\u00e1, but by one of the other B\u00e1b\u00ed chiefs, possibly Ezel.\n\nHaving occupied so much space with this discussion, I must speak very briefly of the points which have not been already noticed in the letter of Beh\u00e1's which constitutes a part of the S\u00fara-i-Heykal. It is written with great humility and moderation; the writer speaks of himself as \"h\u00e1dhi 'l-maml\u00fck\" (\"this slave\"), and prays to God for help and courage to address the King. Turning then to the latter, he declares that those by whom he is surrounded, and who counsel him to act with severity against the B\u00e1bis, do so from interested motives: they have no real attachment to their master, whereas Beh\u00e1 sincerely and earnestly desires his welfare, which can only be secured by the exercise of justice towards all his subjects alike, regardless of their\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Loc. cit. p. 192.\n\n\\(^2\\) Thus, in accordance with its use in Sufi terminology, have I translated the expression Jeber\u00fat, concerning which cf. Jorj\u00e1n\u00ed's Definitions, ed. Fl\u00fcgel, p. 77 and p. 297.\n\n\\(^3\\) Loc. cit. p. 193, l. 7.\ncreed. All other sects and religions are tolerated in his dominions; why are the B\u00e1b\u00eds alone placed under a ban? Let them enjoy the liberty given to others, and they will prove loyal and obedient subjects. As to resistance to the Sh\u00e1h\u2019s authority, Beh\u00e1 has never countenanced it, as he shows by quotations from his former writings, especially a letter to one of his co-religionists on the true meaning of \u201cvictory,\u201d which, he explains, means victory over one\u2019s own heart, and turning aside from all except God, not victory achieved by war, for \u201cstrife has never been and is not beloved of God, nor is the slaughter (of their fellow-creatures) which some of the ignorant have committed pleasing\u201d (to Him). The remainder of the letter is chiefly taken up with strictures on the \u2018ulam\u00e1, certain exceptions being made in favour of members of that class who are free from bigotry and notable for piety. Of these latter a certain Sheyk Murt\u00e1z\u00e1, who used, before his death, to reside at Baghdad, and who had shown kindness to the B\u00e1b\u00ed exiles, is particularly mentioned. As to the others, Beh\u00e1 only demands to be confronted with them in open discussion before the Sh\u00e1h, promising, if he fails to confute them and prove his case, to submit without complaint to whatever sentence the Sh\u00e1h may pronounce against him.\n\nHe quotes from the Kur\u2019\u00e1n the text\\(^1\\) \u201cFa-tamannau\u2019l-mawta, in kuntum \u0161adikin,\u201d \u201cDesire death then, if ye be sincere,\u201d and asks whether the B\u00e1b\u00eds or their enemies the Musulm\u00e1n divines, have best responded to this test. Nor can it be alleged, he adds, that the B\u00e1b\u00eds are impelled by a sort of madness to this readiness to meet death, for it is not a thing confined to a few only. He cries out against the injustice of condemning the votaries of the new faith unheard, quoting again from the Kur\u2019\u00e1n the verse,\\(^2\\) \u201cIn j\u00e1\u2019a f\u00e1sikun bi-naba\u2019in fa-tabayyan\u00fa,\u201d \u201cEven if a sinner come unto you with a message, investigate (it).\u201d Many traditions are also quoted, including one which says that the \u2018ulam\u00e1 of the latter days shall be most wicked and unjust, and this tradition, he says,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Kur\u2019\u00e1n ii. 88, and lxii. 66.\n\n\\(^2\\) Kur\u2019\u00e1n xlix. 6.\nhas been fulfilled in these days. It is pointed out that in all previous \"manifestations\" they are the most bitter enemies of the light, which statement is illustrated by the treatment which Christ experienced at the hands of the Jewish doctors. After again exhorting the Sh\u00e1h to be just, and seek after the truth, since the pomp and majesty of Empire pass away, Beh\u00e1 concludes by describing the insecurity and danger in which he has lived owing to the malice of his enemies, which is graphically described in the following sentence, with which I conclude: \"Fi akthari ayy\u00e1mi kuntu ke-'abdin illadhi yak\u00fanu j\u00e1lisan ta\u1e25ta sayfin 'ullika bi-sha'r(at)in w\u00e1hidatin, wa lam yadri mat\u00e1 yanzilu 'aleyhi fi 'l-h\u00edn, aw ba'da h\u00edn,\" \"For most of my days I was as a servant who is sitting under a sword which is suspended by a single hair, and he knoweth not when it shall descend upon him, at once, or after a while.\"\n\nb. Letter to the Ra'\u00eds.\n\nI have already stated that I believe this letter to have been addressed to Al\u00ed P\u00e1sh\u00e1, but that I am not certain of this point. It is written entirely in Arabic, and is the longest of the letters comprised in the S\u00fara-i-Heykal with the exception of the letter to the Sh\u00e1h which has just been described. Though the first part of it is addressed to the Turkish official designated by the word Ra'\u00eds (chief), the latter portion is devoted to answering certain questions about the soul propounded by one of the faithful who had apparently proved his sincerity by the sufferings which he had undergone for the faith. As the letter contains an obvious reference to the death of the \"Martyrs of Isfah\u00e1n,\" which event I believe I am right in placing about the year A.D. 1880, it must have been written at a much later date than most of the others now included in the S\u00fara-i-Heykal. I must confine myself to giving a translation of some of the most interesting passages.\n\n\"O chief!\" the letter begins, \"hear the voice of God, the Protecting Self-existing King. Verily He crieth between\nthe earth and the heavens, and summoneth all to the most glorious outlook (al-man\u1e93aru'l-abh\u00e1), neither doth thy grunting prevent Him, nor the barking of those who are around thee, nor the hosts of the two worlds. . . . O chief! thou hast committed that by reason of which Muhammad the Prophet of God lamenteth in the highest heaven. And the world hath made thee proud in such wise that thou hast turned away from the Face of Him by whose light the people of the supreme assembly are illuminated, and thou shalt find thyself in a manifest loss. And thou didst unite with the Persian chief in opposition to me after that I came unto you from the rising-place of Greatness and Might with a matter whereby the eyes of those near (to God) are refreshed (i.e. whereby they are rejoiced). By God! this is a day wherein the Fire speaketh through all things, 'The Belov\u00e9d of the two worlds is come.' . . . Dost thou imagine that thou canst quench the Fire which God hath kindled in the horizons? No, by Himself, the True One, wert thou of those who knew! Rather by that which thou hast done its burning is increased and its blaze. . . . And the 'Land of the Mystery' (i.e. Adrianople) and what is beside it shall be changed, and shall pass out of the hand of the King (i.e. the Sultan of Turkey), and commotions shall appear, and lamentation shall arise, and trouble shall become manifest on all sides, and matters shall be altered by reason of that which hath come on these hearts from the hosts of the oppressors. . . . Look! and then remember when Muhammad came with manifest signs on the part of the Mighty (and) Wise One. The people would have stoned him in the public places and streets, and they denied the signs of God, thy Lord, and the Lord of thy fathers who were before. And the learned ('Ulam\u00e1) denied him; then those factions who followed them, and after them the Kings of the earth, as thou hast heard in the stories of those who were aforetime. And of these was Kisr\u00e1,\u00b9 unto whom he sent a kind letter, inviting him to God, and forbidding him from polytheism; and verily thy Lord hath knowledge of all things. Verily he made himself\n\n\u00b9 i.e. Khusraw Parviz, the Sasanian king.\ngreat against God, and tore up the letter, because he followed his passion and lust. Is he not of the people of hell? Was Pharaoh able to hinder God from His dominion when he rebelled in the earth, and was of the disobedient? . . . Say, verily the King of Persia slew the Belov\u00e9d of both worlds that he might thereby extinguish the Light of God amongst His creatures (lit. \"What is beside Him\") and hinder mankind from the pure water of Life in the days of God, the Mighty, the Kind. . . . Leave the mention of the Chief; then mention the friend who came to know the love of God, and separated himself from those who associated (other things with God), and were of the lost. . . . Know, then, that we were in the morning one day and we found the friends of God confronted by the transgressors. The troops beset all the gates, and prevented the servants (of God) from entrance and exit, and were of the oppressors. And the friends of God, and His family, were left without food in the first night: thus did it befall those for whose sake was created the world and what is therein. Shame upon them! and upon those who commanded them to (do) evil! and God shall consume their livers with fire, and verily He is the fiercest of Avengers. Men gathered round the house, and the eyes of Isl\u00e1m and of the Christians wept, and the sound of weeping arose betwixt heaven and earth because of that which the hands of the oppressors had wrought. Verily we found the assembly of the Son (i.e. the Christians) more bitter in their weeping than (those of) other creeds, and herein are indeed signs to the thoughtful. And one from amongst the friends sacrificed (?) himself for myself, and cut his throat with his hand\\(^1\\) from love of God: this is that the like of which we have not heard from former ages. This is that which God hath set apart for this manifestation, as a setting forth of His Power, for verily He is the Mighty and Powerful. And he whose throat was cut in \u2018Ir\u00e1k (i.e. \u2018Ir\u00e1k-i-\u2018Ajam\u00ed), verily he is the \u2018Beloved of Martyrs\u2019 (Mahb\u00fab-u\u2019sh-Shuhad\u00e1) and their King (Sult\u00e1n), and that which appeared from him was the\n\n\\(^1\\) This event I described briefly in my former paper on the B\u00e1bis, p. 516.\nproof of God unto all creatures. This is a day unto which, had Muhammad the Prophet of God attained, he would assuredly say, 'We have known Thee, O Desire of (all) the apostles.' And had the Friend (i.e. Abraham) attained it, he would certainly place his face upon the earth, humbling himself before God, and would say, 'My heart is at peace, O God of whomsoever is in the heavens and the earths, and Thou hast caused me to behold the kingdom of Thy Command, and the dominion of Thy Might, and I bear witness that at Thy Manifestation the hearts of those who advance are at peace.' Had the Interlocutor (i.e. Moses) attained it, he would certainly say, 'Praise (be to Thee) for that Thou hast shown me Thy beauty, and hast made me of those who increase.' . . . . And God shall raise up one amongst the Kings who shall succour His saints, for He encompasseth all things. And He shall put into the hearts (of men) the love of His saints, and this is a decree on the part of the Mighty, the Beautiful (One). . . . Give thanks to God in that He hath strengthened thee with knowledge of Himself, and caused thee to enter into His protection on a day whereon the unbelievers encompassed the people of God and His saints, and drove them forth from their houses, with evident tyranny. And they desired to bring about a separation between us on the shore of the sea, and verily thy Lord is aware of that which is in the breasts of the unbelievers. Say, 'Though ye cut off our limbs, the love of God will not depart from our hearts: verily we were created for sacrifice: therefore do we glory over the two worlds.' \" The remainder of the letter, which discusses the nature of the soul, I am compelled to omit for lack of space.\n\nc. Letter to the Pope.\n\nOf this also I append a few extracts without comment:\n\n\"O Pope! rend asunder the veils! The Lord of Lords hath come in the shadow of clouds, and the matter hath been\n\n1 I think there can be no doubt that the \"Martyrs of Isfah\u00e1n\" are here alluded to, concerning whom see my former paper, p. 489 et seq.\ndecided on the part of God, the Powerful, the Unconstrained. Disclose the (divine) splendours (?) by the authority of thy Lord; then ascend into the Kingdom of Names and Attributes: thus doth the Supreme Pen command thee on the part of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Controller. Verily He hath come from heaven another time, as He came from it the first time: beware lest ye oppose Him as the Pharisees opposed Him without evidence or proof. On His right side floweth the River of Grace, and on His left side the Sweet Waters of Justice: before Him go the angels of Paradise with the standards of signs. Beware lest Names withhold you from God the Maker of the earth and the heavens. . . . Dost thou dwell in palaces, while the King of the Manifestation is in the most ruined of abodes?\u00b9 . . . The breath of God is diffused throughout the world, because the Desired One hath come in His Most Great Glory. Lo! every stone and clod crieth, \u2018The Promised One hath appeared, and the Kingdom is to God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Pardoning. Beware lest sciences prevent thee from the King of what is known, or the world from Him who created it and left it. Arise in the Name of thy Lord the Merciful amidst the assembly of beings, and take the Cup of Life in the hand of assurance; drink therefrom, or not; then give to drink to those who advance of the people of (different) religions. . . . Remember when the Spirit\u00b2 came; he who was the most learned of the doctors of his age gave sentence against Him in his city, while those who caught fish believed in Him; be admonished, then, O people of understanding! . . . And when We come unto you another time we see you fleeing from Us, therefore doth the eye of My compassion weep over my people; fear God, O ye who are in expectation! . . . Look likewise at this time. How many monks seclude themselves in churches in My Name; and when the appointed time was completed, and We disclosed to them perfection (?), they did not know Me, after that they call\n\n\u00b9 i.e. Acre ('Akk\u0101), which is often thus described by Beh\u0101'\u012b in his writings.\n\u00b2 i.e. Christ, whom the Muhammadans call \"R\u016b\u1e25u'll\u0101h,\" \"The Spirit of God.\"\nupon Me at eventide and at dawn. . . . Do ye read the Gospel, and (still) do not flee to the Glorious Lord? This beseemeth you not, O concourse of learned ones! . . . The Word which the Most Faithful wrote hath appeared: It hath indeed descended into the form of man in this time: blessed is the Lord, who is the Father: He hath come with His most mighty Power amongst the nations; turn towards Him, O concourse of the good! . . . . The Father hath come, and that which hath been promised unto you in the kingdom is accomplished: this is a Word which was concealed behind the veil of Might, and when the promised (time) came, it shone forth from the horizon of the (Divine) Will with manifest signs. . . . My body longeth for the Cross, and my head for the spear (?) in the way of the Merciful One (i.e. God), that the world may be purified from sin. . . . The people of the Furk\u00e1n (i.e. the Muhammadans) have arisen, and tormented me with torments whereat the Holy Spirit crieth out; and the thunder roars, and the eyes of the clouds weep because of the unbelievers. Whosoever imagineth that calamity will hinder Beh\u00e1 from that which God, the Creator of (all) things, willeth, say (unto him), No! by the descent of the rains, nothing shall prevent him from the mention of his Lord. By God the Truth! even though they burn him on the earth, verily he will lift up his head in the midst of the sea, and will cry, \u2018Unto God indeed belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and in the earth.\u2019 And even though they cast him into a dark pit, they shall find him on the summits of the mountains, crying, \u2018The Desired One hath come by the authority of Might and Sovereignty.\u2019 And though they bury him in the earth, he will arise from the horizons of heaven, and will speak with the loudest voice, \u2018Beh\u00e1 hath come to the kingdom of God, the Holy, the Mighty, the Unconstrained.\u2019 And though they shed his blood, every drop thereof shall cry out and call upon God by this Name whereby the perfumes of the Garment are diffused through (all) regions. . . . And regard the pearl, that its lustre is in itself: if thou coverest it with silk, verily it veileth the beauty and\nqualities thereof: such is man; his nobility is in his virtues. . . . O people of the Son! we have sent unto you John (the Baptist) another time. Verily he crieth in the wilderness of the Bey\u00e1n, 'O creation of beings! make clear your eyes! The day of vision and meeting hath come nigh. Prepare then the way, O people of the Gospel. The day wherein shall come the Lord of Glory hath come nigh: prepare to enter into the Kingdom. Thus was the matter decreed on the part of God, the Cleaver of the Dawn. . . . This is indeed the Father, whereof Isaiah gave you tidings, and the Comforter whom the Spirit (i.e. Christ) promised. . . . Hasten unto Him, and follow not every denying infidel. And if the eye of any one oppose him in this, it behoves him to pluck it out; and if his tongue oppose him, it behoves him to cut it out. Thus was it written by the Pen of Eternity on the part of the King of Contingent Being (Imk\u00e1n); verily He hath come another time for your deliverance, O people of creation: will ye kill Him after that He desireth for you enduring life? Fear God, O people of discernment. . . . The Glorious One crieth continually from the horizon of the Pavilion of Might and Greatness, and saith 'O people of the Gospel! He hath come into the Kingdom who was out of it; and to-day we see you standing at the Gate. Rend the veils by the power of your Lord, the Mighty, the Munificent, and then enter into my Kingdom in my Name; thus doth He command you who desireth for you enduring life; verily He is powerful over all things. Blessed are those who have known the Light, and have hastened towards it: behold, they are in the Kingdom, they eat and drink with the elect. And we see you, O children of the Kingdom, in darkness: this is not meet for you. Do ye fear to meet the Light because of your deeds? Advance thereto. . . . Verily He said, 'Come, that I may make you my fishers; come, that I may make you fishers of men;' and to-day we say, 'Come, that we may make you the\n\n1 i.e. Followers of Christ, the Son of God.\n2 The B\u00e1b, who was the precursor (mubashir) of Beh\u00e1, is here intended.\nvivifiers of the world.' Thus was the decree ordained in a tablet written by the Pen of Command.\"\n\nd. Letter to Napoleon III.\n\nThis letter is rather longer than the last, and like it is entirely in Arabic. As much of what it contains is merely a repetition of the substance of what has been or will be noticed elsewhere, I shall give translations of only a few of the more important passages. The letter begins thus:\n\n\"O King of Paris! tell the priest not to ring (lit. strike) the bells. By God, the True One! the Most Glorious Bell hath appeared on the Temple of the Most Great Name, and the fingers of the will of Thy Lord, the High, the Supreme, ring (lit. strike) it in the World of Eternal Power (Jeber\u00fatu 'l-Bak\u00e1) through his Most Splendid Name (Ismuhu 'l-Abh\u00e1): thus have the most mighty signs of thy Lord descended once more, that thou mayest arise to commemorate God, the Creator of the Earth and the Heaven. . . . We have sent one whom we have strengthened with the Holy Spirit that he may give you tidings of this Light which hath shone forth from the horizon of the Will of your Lord, the Exalted, the Most Splendid, and whose effects have appeared in the West, that ye may turn unto Him in this day . . . Arise amongst the servants (of God) in My Name and say, 'O people of the Earth advance towards Him, who hath advanced towards you, for verily He is the Face of God (Wajhu'll\u00e1h) amongst you, and His Evidence in your midst, and His Proof unto you. . . . This is that whereof the Spirit\\(^1\\) gave you tidings when He brought the truth, and the Jewish doctors opposed Him, until they committed that whereat the Holy Spirit lamented. . . . Say, O concourse of monks! do not withdraw yourselves in churches and sanctuaries; come forth (thence) by my permission, then occupy yourselves with that whereby your souls shall be profited, and the souls of mankind. . . . He who cleaveth to the house is indeed as one dead: it is meet for man that he should produce\n\n\\(^1\\) i.e. Christ, \"R\u00fah\u00fa'll\u00e1h,\" as before stated.\nthat whereby (other) beings shall profit; and he who hath no fruit is fit for the Fire... Verily, O King, we heard from thee a word which thou didst speak when the King of Russia asked of thee concerning what was settled as to the order of war: verily thy Lord is Wise and Informed. Thou didst say, 'I was asleep in my bed (when) the cry of the servants (of God) who were wronged, even till they were drowned in the Black Sea, awoke me.' Thus did we hear, and God is the Witness of what I say. Thou canst witness that it was not (their) cry, but (thine own) lust (of war) which awoke thee, inasmuch as we tried thee and found thee afar off... Hadst thou been the speaker (lit. owner) of that speech, thou wouldst not have cast the book of God behind thy back when it was sent unto thee on the part of one Mighty and Wise. Verily we tried thee therewith, and did not find thee in that state whereto thou didst pretend: arise, and make reparation for what has passed away from thee. The world shall perish, and what thou hast, and the Kingdom remains to God, thy Lord, and the Lord of thy fathers who were of yore... Because of what thou hast done affairs shall be changed in thy kingdom, and empire shall depart from thine hands, as a punishment for thine action: then shalt thou find thyself in manifest loss, and commotion shall scize the peoples there, unless thou arisest to assist in this matter, and followest the Spirit in this Straight Way. Thy glory hath made thee proud: by my life! Verily it shall not endure, but shall pass away, unless thou takest hold of this firm rope. We have seen humiliation hastening after thee, while thou art of those that sleep.\"\u00b9\n\nThe letter contains many other passages of interest, and is vivid and graphic in its eloquence. It concludes with a summary of some of the ordinances of the new religion, especially as regards fasting and the observance of the two great feasts recognized by the B\u00e1b\u00eds. The last paragraph is directed against inordinate love of fame and glory.\n\n\u00b9 The passages in italics contain the prophecy of the downfall of Napoleon III. to which I alluded in my last paper.\ne. Letter to the Emperor of Russia.\n\nThis is the shortest of all these letters, if indeed it be given in extenso in my MS. It seems to end so abruptly that I cannot help thinking it may be incomplete. It contains thanks on the part of Beh\u00e1 for services rendered by a Russian minister during his captivity. I content myself with giving a translation of this passage, preceded only by the first two or three lines:\n\n\u201cO King of Russia! hear the voice of God, the Most Holy King! Then advance unto Paradise (which is) the place wherein abideth He who is named with the Most Comely Names amongst the most high assembly, and in the Kingdom of Creation by the Name of God, the Splendid, the Most Splendid (All\u00e1hu\u2019l-Bah\u00edyyu\u2019l-Abh\u00e1): beware lest thy desires prevent thee from turning towards the face\u00b9 (wajh) of thy Lord, the Merciful, the Clement. . . . One of thine Ambassadors did assist me when I was in prison, in chains and fetters. Therefore hath God decreed unto thee a station which the knowledge of no one comprehendeth, save He only. Beware lest thou change this lofty station; verily thy Lord is able to do whatsoever He willeth: He cancelleth what He pleaseth and confirmeth what He pleaseth, and with Him is the knowledge of all things in a Preserved Tablet. . . . Be not of those who used to call upon Him by a Name amongst His Names, and when the Named One came, they denied Him, and turned away from Him, until they pronounced sentence against him with evident injustice. Look, then, and remember the days wherein came the Spirit,\u00b2 and Herod gave judgment against Him: God hath helped the Spirit with the hosts of the Unseen.\u201d\n\nf. Letter to Queen Victoria.\n\nThis letter begins as follows:\n\n\u201cO Queen in London! Hear the voice of thy Lord, the\n\n\u00b9 It will be remembered that some of the letters in the MSS. noticed by M. Huart (see p. 941) are described as emanating from some person entitled \u2018Al-Wajh\u2019 (\u201cThe Face\u201d). I have suggested that this may be another title of Ezel, but Beh\u00e1 applies it to himself in several places in these letters.\n\u00b2 i.e. Christ.\nKing of (all) Creatures from the Divine Lote-tree that 'There is no God but Me, the Precious, the Wise.' Lay aside what is on the earth: then adorn the head of dominion with the diadem of thy glorious Lord: verily He hath come into the world with His most great Glory, and that which was mentioned in the Gospel hath been fulfilled. The land of Syria hath been honoured by the advance of its Lord, the King of men, and the exhilaration of the Wine of Union hath seized upon the regions of the South and North: blessed is he who discovereth the seent of the Merciful (i.e. God), and advanceth to the dawning-place of Beauty in this clear Morning. . . . It hath reached us that thou hast forbidden the selling of slaves and handmaidens: this is what God hath commanded in this marvellous Manifestation. God hath recorded unto thee the reward of this: verily He is the Discharger of the rewards of the well-doers. . . . And we have heard that thou hast entrusted the reins of deliberation into the hands of the Commonwealth.\u00b9 Thou hast done well, for thereby the bases of the edifices of (all) affairs are made firm, and the hearts of those who are under thy shadow (i.e. protection), both of high and low, are made tranquil. But it behoves them\u00b2 to be (as) trustees amongst the servants (of God), and to regard themselves as guardians over whomsoever is in all the earth. And when any one turns towards the assembly, let him turn his glanee to the Supreme Horizon, and say, 'O God! I ask Thee by Thy Most Splendid Name (bi'smika'l-Abh\u00e1) to assist me unto that whereby the affairs of Thy servants may prosper, and Thy countries may flourish; verily Thou art Powerful over all things.' Blessed is he who entereth the assembly in the regard of God, and judgeth betwixt men with pure justice: is he not of those who prosper? . . . And look on the world as the body of a man who was created sound and whole, but diseases have attacked him from various and diverse causes, and his soul is not at ease for a day, but rather his sickness increaseth, in that he hath fallen under the control of unskilful\n\n\u00b9 Alludes to the system of Representative Government.\n\u00b2 i.e. those who are chosen to represent the people.\nphysicians who are hurried away by vain desires, and are of those who stray madly. And if one limb of his limbs become sound in one age of the ages through a skilful Physician, the other limbs remain as they were: thus doth the Wise and Knowing One inform you. . . . And that which God hath made the most mighty remedy and the most complete means for its health is the union of whomsoever is upon the Earth in a single Matter,\\(^1\\) and a single Law. This can never be possible except through a skilful physician, perfect and strengthened (by God). By my life! this is the truth, and aught else is nothing but evident error.\"\n\nThe writer goes on to say that whenever this True Physician (\\(i.e.\\) a Prophet) has come to heal the world of its ancient sickness, these would-be doctors (\\(muta\u1e6dabbib\u016bn\\)) strive to hinder and prevent him, and \"become (as) clouds between him and the world,\" even as, in the present manifestation, they have \"placed him in confinement in the most desolate of lands\"\\(^2\\) for the alleged reason that he is one of those who make mischief; and this they do although they have not seen him nor spoken with him, and though they see that he has never been free from the causeless oppression and persecution of his enemies. Rulers are next exhorted to seek after peace rather than war as follows:\n\n\"We ask God that He will help the Kings to be at peace: verily He is able to do what He willeth. O assembly of Kings! Verily we see you increasing your expenditure every year, and placing the burden (thereof) on your subjects: this is nought but manifest injustice. Fear the sighs of the oppressed and his tears, and do not burden your subjects above that which they can bear, neither ruin them to build up your palaces: Choose for them that which ye choose for yourselves: thus do we expound unto you that which will profit you, if ye are of those who enquire.\"\n\nI can only pause for a moment to notice one further point. In this letter, as in that addressed to Napoleon, allusion is made to a previous appeal to the Kings. I have already\n\n\\(^1\\) *Amr*, \\(i.e.\\) Religion, in which sense the word is much used by the B\u00e1b\u00eds.\n\n\\(^2\\) \\(i.e.\\) Acre, as stated previously.\npointed out the difficulties of regarding the epistle described by Baron Rosen as the work of Beh\u00e1, but it must be admitted that until another letter is discovered which, besides being addressed to the Rulers of Christian countries, corresponds more closely in style with Beh\u00e1\u2019s writings, considerable uncertainty on this point must remain.\n\n3. The \u2018Lawh-i-A\u1e33das\u2019 (Most Holy Tablet).\n\nI now come to the most important of Beh\u00e1\u2019s works, and the last of which I shall speak at length; I mean the Law\u1e25-i-A\u1e33das, wherein his prescriptions are arranged and codified. Of this work I have three MSS. in my possession, two of which I obtained at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, and one at Kirm\u00e1n. Another copy, marked Or. 2820, is in the British Museum. One of the copies which I possess was written for me by one of the B\u00e1b\u00ed missionaries of whom I spoke in my last paper. It is well and carefully written in a good Naskh handwriting, and contains 146 pages, each of which, except the first and last, comprises 11 lines. I should estimate that the total number of words contained in it is rather over 10,000. I shall translate the first few lines, and then notice the contents in detail in the order in which they occur as briefly as possible, only translating passages which appear to me of special interest.\n\nIt begins thus:\n\n\u201cIn the Name of Him who ruleth over what was and is.\n\n\u201cVerily the first thing which God hath ordained unto (His) servants is the Knowledge of the Dawning-place of His revelation and the Rising-place of His command, who was the station of Himself in the world of command and creation.\\(^1\\) Whosocver attaineth thereunto hath attained unto all good, and he who is deprived (thereof) is indeed of the people of error, even though he bringeth all (good)\n\n\\(^1\\) i.e. the first thing necessary to men is that they should know Beh\u00e1, the present \u201cmanifestation\u201d of God in the World, without which knowledge good actions are of no avail.\nactions. And when ye have attained to this most glorious station, and this most lofty horizon, it behoveth every one to follow that whereunto he is commanded on the part of the (Supreme) Object, because these two (things) are together: one of them will not be accepted without the other. This is what the Rising-place of Inspiration hath decreed. Verily those who are given vision from God will regard the ordinances of God as the greatest means to the order of the world and the preservation of the nations, and he who is careless is of the vile and worthless.\"\n\nThe first prescription given concerns prayer, which is ordained three times a day, in the morning, the afternoon and the evening; each prayer is apparently intended to consist of three prostrations (rik\u02bfa), since it is said that there are to be nine in all. The worshipper is to turn his face towards \"the Most Holy Region, the Holy Place, which God hath made the point round which the Supreme Concourse revolves, and that whereto the denizens of the cities of Permanence advance, and that whence issueth the command to whomsoever is in the earths and the heavens.\" By this Acre is apparently intended, for it is added that \"when the Sun of Truth and Exhortation sets\" (i.e. when Beh\u00e1 dies) the Kibla will be changed to \"that place which we have appointed unto you.\" All congregational prayer is abolished except in the single case of the prayers used for the Burial of the Dead. The wearing of garments which contain the hair of animals, or which are made of their skins, or have buttons of bone or ivory, is allowed: \"verily it was not prohibited in the Furk\u00e1n (i.e. the Kur\u2019\u00e1n), but it was misunderstood by the divines.\" In the case of those who are on a journey the prayers are still further shortened, a simple \"Subh\u00e1na\u2019ll\u00e1h\" (\"Glory to God\") sufficing for those who cannot manage more. Further directions for prayer are given, into which I have not space to enter here.\n\nFasts and Feasts are next treated of. The great festival is the Persian Nawruz (New Year\u2019s Day) when the Sun enters the sign of Aries, and this is made the beginning of the B\u00e1b\u00ed year, which, as I have already stated, consists\nof 19 months of 19 days each, to which five intercalary days (Khamsa-i-mustaraka) are added, thus bringing the total number of days in the year to 366. The month of fasting is that which immediately precedes the Nawruz; in other words, the last month of the B\u00e1b\u00ed year; and the five intercalary days are inserted between it and the preceding month, and are commanded to be observed by entertaining relatives and friends and feeding the poor. The fast itself lasts from sunrise to sunset daily during the month of 19 days, and is incumbent upon all except the young, the sick, the aged, and the infirm.\n\nThese instructions are followed by a prohibition of Murder, Adultery, Slandering and Backbiting, after which the Law of Inheritance is laid down. This is too complicated and obscure to discuss in detail in this place: suffice it to say that seven classes inherit, to wit, children, wives, fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, and teachers; the share of each diminishing from the first to the last. In the absence of one or more of these classes, the share which would belong to them goes to the \"House of Justice\" (Beytu'l-'Adl), to be expended on the poor, the fatherless and widows, or on useful public works, as shall be decided by the members thereof. The constitution of this \"House of Justice,\" though not described till further on in the Lawh-i-A\u1e33das, is best mentioned here. The number of its members is to be \"according to the number of Beh\u00e1\" (which will be eight if we take the values of the letters in that word, but perhaps 19 is intended), though it may exceed this. In every city there must be one such \"House of Justice,\" the members of which must regard themselves as the trustees and representatives of God in the world, and strive to fulfil for the public good the trust placed in them.\n\nPlaces of worship are to be built, and they must not contain any images or pictures. The dead are to be buried with much pomp and ceremony, having been placed in coffins of stone or hard wood. Pilgrimages to the \"House\" (Beyt) are commanded to such as can undertake them, but women are excused. By the \"House\" most of the B\u00e1b\u00eds whom I\nasked understood the B\u00e1b\u2019s house at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z in the K\u00fach\u00e9-i-Shish\u00e9-gar\u00e1n (Glass-blowers Street).\n\nNext follows an absolute prohibition of mendicity couched in the following words: \u201cThe most hateful of mankind before God is he who sits and begs: take hold of the rope of means, relying on God, the Causer of causes.\u201d Men are forbidden to kiss one another\u2019s hands, or to ask pardon for one another (from God): those who have done wrong must repent and turn to God.\n\nThose who claim inward knowledge and pretend to understand Divine mysteries are next censured. By this passage, which I have already quoted (p. 883), the S\u00faf\u00eds and Philosophers appear to be intended. Austerities and self-mortification are forbidden, and their uselessness is exposed.\n\nA statement next follows to the effect that any one who claims to have a new Revelation before the accomplishment of a thousand years is a liar, and to make this more unmistakeable, it is added that no sort of explanation or interpretation of this verse contrary to its obvious meaning is to be attempted or listened to.\u00b9\n\nA passage now comes which is important as in some degree fixing the date when the work was composed. Speaking of some event Beh\u00e1 says, \u201cThis is what we informed you of when we were in \u2018Ir\u00e1k (i.e. Baghdad), and in the Land of the Mystery (i.e. Adrianople), and in this bright watch-tower\u201d (i.e. Acre). Again alluding to his death he says in the next verse, \u201cWhen the Sun of my Beauty has set and the Heaven of my Form is concealed be not troubled; arise for the help of my religion (lit. affair) and the exaltation of my word betwixt the worlds. Verily we are with you in all circumstances, and will assist you with the Truth: verily we are able (to do so).\n\nProvision is made for the disposal of endowments (Wakf) in the event of B\u00e1biism becoming the dominant religion in any country, the control over these belonging to Beh\u00e1 so long as he lives, then to his sons (Agh\u1e63\u00e1n), and then to the House of Justice.\n\n\u00b9 See above, p. 883-884, where this passage is quoted.\nTheft and its punishment are then treated of. For a first or second offence imprisonment is decreed, but on the third conviction a mark or sign is to be placed on the forehead of the thief, whereby he may be known wherever he goes, that men may beware of him.\n\nCertain regulations for private life and personal conduct follow. Shaving the head is forbidden, because \"God hath adorned it with hair,\" but the latter is not to be allowed to grow below the level of the ears. The use of gold and silver plate and ornaments is permitted, and the use of knives and forks in eating instead of the hands is enjoined. Cleanliness is insisted on. Parents are commanded to instruct their children; if they refuse, the \"House of Justice\" must see to the matter, charging the expenses of education to the parents if they are able to bear them, and if not, defraying them out of the funds at its disposal. Music is permitted.\n\nRegulations for the punishment of some other crimes follow. Adultery is punished by a fine of 19 mi\u0161k\u00e1ls of gold, to be paid to the House of Justice, the fine being doubled for a second offence. Wounds and blows are also atoned for by fines proportionate to their gravity. Arson and murder are punishable by burning and death respectively, but in place of this the offender may be imprisoned for life. Birds killed in the chase may be lawfully eaten, even though they have not had their throats cut and the Bismi'll\u00e1h uttered over them.\n\nMarriage is enjoined on all, and is made conditional on the consent of both parties and their parents, only the former being necessary according to the law laid down in the Bey\u00e1n. Instructions concerning dowries are given. Married men who travel must fix a definite time for their return, and use their utmost endeavours not to extend their absence beyond it. Their wives, if they have no news of them for nine months after the expiration of this period, are allowed to marry again, but if they are patient it is better, \"since God loves those who are patient.\" If quarrels arise between a man and his wife, he is not to divorce her at once, but must wait for a whole year that perhaps he may become reconciled\nto her. If, however, at the expiration of this period, he still wishes to put her away, he is at liberty to do so, but may take her back at the end of any month so long as she does not marry again, in which case \"the separation is rendered valid by a new union.\" The practice of marrying a divorced woman to another man before her former husband can take her back is forbidden. If a man is travelling with his wife and they quarrel, he must give her a sufficient sum of money to take her back to the place they started from, and send her with some trustworthy person who will look after her.\n\nThe traffic in slaves is forbidden, and men are warned to be careful about the destruction of life. Legal impurity is abolished, and the people of all religions are regarded as pure and not to be avoided. The use of pleasant perfumes, and especially rose-water, is recommended.\u00b9\n\nThe kings of the earth are then addressed and exhorted to adopt and spread the new faith. The Emperor of Germany is reproved, apparently because he had gone on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and had passed by Acre without visiting Beh\u00e1 or asking after him, on account of which neglect calamities and defeat are foretold to the German nation as follows: \"O banks of the river Rhine! we have seen you drenched in gore because the swords of retribution were drawn against you, and you shall have another turn. And we hear the lamentation of Berlin, though it be to-day in manifest glory.\"\n\nTurkey, personified in Constantinople, is also addressed thus: \"O Point which liest on the shore of the two Seas! The throne of injustice hath been fixed in thee, and in thee hath been kindled the fire of hatred in such wise that the Supreme Host lament thereat, and those who circle around the lofty Throne. We behold in thee the foolish ruling over the wise, and the darkness exalting itself over the light, and verily thou art in evident delusion. Thine outward adornment hath rendered thee proud; thou shalt perish, by the Lord of Creation! and thy daughters and widows and those peoples that are within thee shall lament. Thus doth the Wise, the All-Knowing, admonish thee.\"\n\n\u00b9 See above, p 899, note.\nSome of the cities and provinces of Persia are then addressed. Teher\u00e1n is blessed because Beh\u00e1 was born there, and comforted thus: \"If He (i.e. God) will, He will bless thy throne with one who shall rule with justice and gather together the sheep of God which have been scattered by the wolves. . . . Affairs shall be changed in thee, and a republic of men shall rule over thee. Verily thy Lord is the Wise, the Encompasser.\"\n\nKhur\u00e1s\u00e1n is also comforted, and applauded because therein are heard \"the voices of men commemorating thy Lord, the Rich, the Exalted.\" The faithful are enjoined not to oppose those that rule over them, but to \"leave to them that which they have,\" and address themselves to gaining the hearts of men.\n\nKirm\u00e1n is subsequently addressed and sharply rebuked for the pretensions to spiritual knowledge of some of its people. That this alludes to the Sheykhis, who are, as before stated, the followers of H\u00e1j\u00ed Muhammad Kar\u00edm Kh\u00e1n, is pretty certain, especially as the latter is held up to execration in a later passage.\n\nTithes of nineteen per cent. are decreed on all who possess more than a hundred mi\u0161k\u00e1ls of gold. Believers are exhorted not to withhold these, since by giving them their wealth will be purified.\n\nHere a digression occurs, explaining that this book was \"revealed\" because Beh\u00e1 had at different times received letters from believers asking for instructions as to conduct, etc., which were now epitomized so as to be accessible to all. The learned are warned against criticizing it, or judging of its style and contents according to their limited horizons. They are also challenged to produce the like of it with all their learning, and are reminded that Beh\u00e1 never studied the sciences which they have learned, but that all his wisdom is received from God. All explanations of the sacred text contrary to the obvious sense thereof are again forbidden.\n\nCertain further regulations concerning personal cleanliness follow. The nails are to be cut and the body bathed at least once a week, but the use of the tanks (Khaz\u00edna) in the\nPersian baths is forbidden, because the water in them is generally not changed sufficiently often and so becomes foul and offensive. It is therefore recommended that the body should be washed by pouring water over it rather than by entering the water. Praying in the streets is forbidden, probably as savouring of ostentation. Festivals are again spoken of and are limited to two: the anniversaries of the \"manifestations\" of Beh\u00e1 and the B\u00e1b. As we have seen that the Nawruz is the great festival of the B\u00e1bis, and as we know that the \"manifestation\" of the B\u00e1b occurred on Jam\u00e1d\u00ed\u2019ul-\u016cl\u00e1 5th, A.H. 1260 (May 23rd, A.D. 1844), it seems probable that that of Beh\u00e1 was on the Nawruz.\n\nThe contents of the next portion of the Lawh-i-A\u1e33das, so far as they can be classified, refer mainly to the B\u00e1b, and certain modifications of the ordinances laid down by him which are considered necessary. By him it was enacted that whoever possessed any object \"the like of which was not to be found on earth\" was to give it to Him whom God shall manifest (Persian Bey\u00e1n, V\u00e1hid v. ch. 16); that useless and especially dead languages were not to be studied (ibid. iv. 10); and that all books were to be re-written every 202 years, and the originals then destroyed or given away (ibid. vii. 1). All these commands are abrogated by Beh\u00e1, and the study of foreign languages for purposes of missionary enterprise is commanded. Some quotations from the B\u00e1b's writings are introduced to prove that Beh\u00e1 is really \"He whom God shall manifest,\" and some of the objections raised by the Ezel\u00eds are met. This portion concludes with praise of the B\u00e1b, and those who do not believe in him are exhorted at any rate not to condemn him, because \"the hosts of the oppressors who assembled against him suffice.\"\n\nWine and opium are prohibited. The instructions for the shrouding of the dead and the placing on their fingers of cornelian rings with certain words (which are detailed) engraven on them are essentially the same as those given in the Bey\u00e1n, which have been already noticed in their proper place. Kindness and courtesy are enjoined on all believers, and they are forbidden to enter any man's house without his\npermission, or in his absence. No one is to approve for another that which he would dislike himself. The sacred books are to be read regularly, but never so long as to cause weariness. Enemies are to be forgiven, nor must evil be met with evil. The furniture of houses is, where possible, to be renewed every nineteen years. Every one is to wash his feet daily in summer, and at least once every three days in winter. The use of chairs is recommended in preference to sitting on the ground. Arms are forbidden to be carried, except in time of war and disturbance. Shaving the beard is permitted.\n\nSheykh Muhammad Hasan (also referred to in the Lawh-i-Nasir) is held up to reprobation. The Bey\u00e1n is again spoken of, and those who believe in it are warned not to allow any passage therein to make them doubt the truth of Beh\u00e1\u2019s claim, since he is the revealer of it, and learned all Divine Mysteries before Creation existed.\n\nNext follow some passages which seem to be addressed to Beh\u00e1\u2019s rival \u0160uhb-i-Ezel, part of which I translate: \u201cSay, O rising-place of opposition! Cease (wilfully) to close thine eyes; then speak of the truth amongst the people. By God! my tears flow over my cheeks because I see thee advancing after thy lust and turning aside from him who created thee and fashioned thee. Remember the kindness of thy Master (Mawl\u00e1ha) when we educated thee during the nights and days for the service of the Religion (lit. \u2018matter\u2019): fear God, and be of those who repent. . . . Remember when thou didst stand before the throne (\u2018arsh) and didst write what we convcved unto thee of the signs (verses) of God, the Guardian, the Able, the Powerful. . . . Verily we advise thee for the sake of God: if thou advancest, (it is) for thyself (i.e. for thine own good); and if thou turnest aside, verily thy Lord is independent of thee and of those who follow thee in manifest error. God hath taken away him who then led thee astray; return unto Him humbled, abased, trembling; verily He will put away from thee thy sins: verily thy Lord is Swift to Repent, the Precious, the Merciful.\u201d\n\nAfter two more clauses, the first strongly forbidding the\nill-treatment and overloading of beasts of burden, the second ordaining the payment in all cases of accidental homicide of the sum of 100 misk\u00e1ls of gold as a compensation to the relatives of the deceased, the book closes with a recommendation that mankind shall select one language and one character of those which exist and adopt them as a means of communication one with another. \"This,\" says Beh\u00e1, \"is the means of union, if ye knew it, and the greatest cause of concord and civilization did ye recognize it. Verily we have made these two things the two signs of the maturity of the world: the first (and that is the chief foundation) we have revealed in other Tablets; and the second we have revealed in this marvellous Tablet.\"\n\nI have now completed my sketch of the sacred literature and the doctrines of the B\u00e1bis. Did I not feel that I had already exceeded the limits reasonably to be assigned to an article of this description, I should have said something about the poems of Nab\u00edl, Na'im, Rawh\u00e1, Maryam, and other B\u00e1bis who have drawn the inspiration of their verses from the doctrines of the new religion. As it is, I unwillingly postpone an account of them till some future occasion.\n\nMy object in this Essay has been to sum up in the briefest compass possible all the more important facts which I have been able to glean on a subject hitherto comparatively little studied; to classify and describe the literature of the different epochs into which the history of B\u00e1biism divides itself; to smooth the path of future students of this last great religious movement to which Persia has given birth; and to point out the most important lacunae which exist in our present knowledge of this matter. The work which was so ably begun by M. le Comte de Gobineau I have attempted to carry down to the present date so far as was possible from the materials at my disposal, though I am painfully conscious that I can lay no claim to the masterly pen and keen insight into character which he possessed, and by the magic of which he transports us as we read his words into the midst of the stirring events which convulsed Persia some forty years ago, in such wise that to us the fiery and zealous Mull\u00e1 Huseyn, the beautiful\nand enthusiastic Kurratu'l-'Ayn, and most of all the gentle, patient, persecuted Founder of the new faith, seem to us as people whom we have met and conversed with rather than such as we have merely read of in history.\n\nIn conclusion I would ask the kind indulgence of the reader for the defects which may be apparent in this Paper, whether of composition, arrangement, selection of material, or treatment thereof. Its preparation, frequently interrupted by other duties, has involved the perusal of a number of Persian and Arabic MSS., some of which were written in a Shikasta handwriting not easy to read. The perusal of these was for the most part accomplished pari passu with the composition of this article, and this was particularly the case with the later writings of Beh\u00e1. That this method of procedure has given rise in some cases to inconsistencies I am fully aware, further study having sometimes obliged me to modify a view expressed, perhaps rashly, in an earlier part of my Paper; while it was not always possible so to alter the passage first written as to eliminate from it all traces of the opinion I had discarded without entirely reconstructing large portions of what I had written. In such cases I have referred in a note to the subsequent passage wherein this modification of opinion is set forth.\n\nLastly, some may perhaps wonder why I did not settle those points as to the date and authorship of certain works which I have been compelled to leave somewhat undecided by reference to my B\u00e1b\u00ed friends while this was still possible. With regard to this, I can only state that to the best of my knowledge I never missed an opportunity of conversing with the B\u00e1b\u00eds on matters connected with their religion, and that the information so acquired was in almost all cases carefully recorded in my Diary within a few hours of the time of hearing it; but that the perusal of the books which I obtained from them, often as a parting gift on the eve of my leaving a town, could not be accomplished amidst the vicissitudes of travel, because, as the Arabs say (and the proverb is specially true in the case of Eastern countries), \"Al-mus\u00e1firu ke'l-majn\u00fan,\" \"The traveller is as one mad.\"\nAPPENDIX I.\n\nI. TRANSLATION OF NAB\u00cdL'S CHRONOLOGICAL POEM OF THE EVENTS IN THE LIFE OF BEH\u00c1.\n\n(1) In the beginning of Ghirb\u00e1l (=1233 A.H. according to the abjad notation) from the year of the Furk\u00e1n (i.e. the Kur\u2019\u00e1n), on the second morning of Muharram, in Teher\u00e1n, that King, who is the Creator of whomsoever is in the world (lit. in the Contingent World), turned His footsteps from the Unseen to the Visible (lit. Contingent) World.\n\n(2) After twice ten and seven (i.e. 27 years) of His pure life it was \u201csixty\u201d (i.e. the year of the \u2018manifestation\u2019 of the B\u00e1b, A.H. 1260), and there was mercy (shown) to the people of His land. He manifested His Supreme Name, so that creatures might comprehend him in that way.\n\n(3) At thirty-two (years) of age He started for the plain; the World became bright from the splendour of His visage; He met, to unfold His glories, with the forms of T\u00e1 (probably Jen\u00e1b-i-T\u00e1hira, i.e. Kurratu\u2019l-\u2018Ayn) and Kuds (Jen\u00e1b-i-Kudd\u00fas, i.e. H\u00e1j\u00ed Mull\u00e1 Muhammad \u2018Al\u00ed B\u00e1lfur\u00fash\u00ed) in the plain of Badasht.\n\n(4) At thirty-three He blossomed like a rose; that God of all set out for (the tomb of Sheykh) \u1e6cabars\u00ed; on the way, by His own hidden Will, He fell in with the people of tyranny at \u00c1mul.\n\n(5) At thirty-five that Monarch of dominion set out towards grief and calamity (there is a play on these words, Karb \u00fa Bela and Karbal\u00e1). At thirty-six when He arrived at Teher\u00e1n He was imprisoned for four months with a hundred pains and griefs.\n\n(6) At thirty-seven the Monarch of Grace arrived at Baghdad with those of His household. At thirty-eight He disappeared from men, lifting up His standard like the Sun on the mountain-land\n\n(7) At the age of forty He went from the plain to Zawr\u00e1 (i.e.\nBaghdad); Zawr\u00e1 in honour became like Yathrib and Bat\u1e25\u00e1 (i.e. Medina and Mecca); His lovers assembled from all directions (lit. from the four quarters); the standard of God (or \u2018of the truth\u2019) was set up by His rule.\n\n(8) At forty-seven that mighty Monarch came from \u1e6cr\u0101k (i.e. Baghdad) travelling to the Great City (i.e. Constantinople): for four months he was journeying like the bright sun with those of His household and His family and His companions.\n\n(9) At forty-eight that Giver of Purity to the earth became for four months a sojourner in the Great City (i.e. Constantinople): in the month of Rajab he reached the \u2018Land of the Mystery\u2019; Edirn\u00e9 (Adrianople) became the envy of the highest Paradise.\n\n(10) When the age of that Wonderful Lord was fifty He tore from His face the veil; sparks fell into the soul of Paradise and the Devil (\u1e6c\u0101gh\u00fat, which also signifies \u2018an idol\u2019): the Sun of Beh\u00e1 appeared from behind the cloud.\n\n(11) When His blessed age was fifty-three, His advance towards Jerusalem took place: in Ghurfa (this word, which is a name for the seventh, or highest heaven, stands in the abjad notation for 1285, which is the year of the hijra intended), and on the twentieth of Rab\u00ed\u2018u\u1e63-\u1e63\u00e1n\u00ed from Adrianople went forth the King of its glory.\n\n(12) On the twelfth day of Jam\u00e1di\u2018ul-avval the King of nations (or creeds) arrived at Acre: it is settled that from beyond this strong prison all kingdoms will advance to His court.\n\n(13) It is now (the month of) Sha\u2018b\u00e1n of the year of F\u00far\u00fa\u2018 (=1286 A.H.): the age of that King is fifty-four. It is now a full year and four months that this strong fortress (i.e. Acre) has been the abode of the Belov\u00e9d.\n\n(14) This year the reckoning of the life of the Belov\u00e9d is \u2018Life\u2019 (j\u00e1n=54, and means \u2018life,\u2019 or \u2018soul\u2019): all\nthe friends are lifeless through separation: the Belov\u00e9d, who is this year established on the throne of \u2018Life\u2019 (j\u00e1n) is ready to give life to those separated.\n\n(15) The King of Permanence with seventy people (i.e. followers) has made His abode in the most desolate of all cities (i.e. Acre): help Thine own religion (amr) Thyself, O King of Permanence; for Thee there is no other helper than Thyself.\n\n(16) How long shall Thy Branches (agh\u015f\u00e1n, \u2018branches,\u2019 is, as I have explained, the term applied to Beh\u00e1\u2019s sons) be in the assembly of the enemy? How long shall Thy friends be scattered on every side? Give life to the troop of those separated from Thee: how long shall this people be lifeless?\n\n(17) Open this year the Gate of Meeting; give exaltation to the People of Beh\u00e1 this year; this year, when j\u00e1n (soul, or life=54) is in conjunction with fari\u2018 (divisions, ramifications=1286), exalt a standard from the Unseen this year.\n\n(18) O Nab\u00edl, (make) a plan for thine own affairs; thou art forty years (old); make a change; ask for the cup of spiritual knowledge from God this year; how long wilt thou stick in the world of Words?\n\n(19) Thine age is forty, (yet) thou art nought but a fool; thou hast not entered in at the gate of the City of the Heart: they say that forty is the year of perfection: thine age is forty, yet hast thou not become perfect.\u201d\n\nN.B.\u2014I have made the above translation as literal as possible, and added such notes as seem to me necessary to render it intelligible. All the dates embodied in it are given with the events corresponding to them and the equivalent Christian dates in the latter part of the \u201cChronological Table\u201d appended to my first Paper on the B\u00e1b\u00eds. I possess only one text of this poem, which I copied for myself from a MS. in the possession of one of my friends at Kirm\u00e1n.\nII.

I have followed my MS. in writing \u062c\u0648 for \u0686\u0648 in the 5th and 10th stanzas, this being a common practice at the present day in Persia when the word is to be read as a short syllable.\nIII.

History of the B\u00e1bis, of which I spoke in my first paper. I have supplied the hamza in three places, diacritical points in two others, and the tashdid in six more. The words \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u06a9\u0627\u0631, which were written together in the original, I have separated. These are all the alterations which I have made in my text.\nAPPENDIX II.\n\nSince the publication of my first Article on the B\u00e1b\u00eds, information bearing on certain points discussed therein or in connexion therewith has reached me. As it seems to me desirable that this should be made public, especially as it has induced me to alter the views I expressed as to the age of the B\u00e1b, I have embodied it in this Appendix, together with sundry other remarks which I wished to add to what I had previously written.\n\nI. The Age of the B\u00e1b.\n\nWhile engaged in the composition of my first Article I wrote to a friend in Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, who is in some sense related to the B\u00e1b, and asked him to endeavour to ascertain the date when the latter was born as nearly as possible, stating at the same time the difficulty I had experienced in reconciling the conflicting statements of different authors.\n\nA short time ago I received an answer stating that the B\u00e1b was born on Muharram 1st, A.H. 1236 (October 9th, 1820), and married in A.H. 1258 (A.D. 1842), two years before the commencement of his mission, at which time he was 24 years of age. It is therefore evident that the two passages which I quoted from the Bey\u00e1n (Journal of Royal Asiatic Society, July, 1889, pp. 508\u2013511) refer to the B\u00e1b\u2019s age at the time when his mission began, not, as I at first thought, to the time when they were composed.\n\nThe B\u00e1b\u2019s widow survived till A.H. 1300, only six years ago. She was the sister of my friend\u2019s maternal grandfather. The above particulars are derived from an old lady of the same family, so that there is every reason to regard them as reliable.\n\nMr. C. D. Cobham, Commissioner at Larnaca, Cyprus, has kindly supplied me with much valuable information about the B\u00e1bi exiles there. Amongst other things he tells me that Mushk\u00edn Kalam (Journ. Roy. Asiat. Soc. July, 1889, pp. 516\u2013517), with whom he was well acquainted, stated the year of the B\u00e1b\u2019s birth as A.D. 1819, which agrees much more nearly with the date above given than with that which I previously put forward.\nII. B\u00e1b\u00ed Exiles in Cyprus.\n\nIn my first article I inserted a note (p. 517) stating that, according to the Arabic Encyclop\u00e6dia called *Da\u2019iratu\u2019l-Ma\u2019\u0101rif*, \u015euh\u1e25-i-Ezel was dead. Information kindly supplied to me by Mr. Houston, Mr. Cobham, and Captain Young, residents in Cyprus, proves this statement to be a mistake. According to the information obtained by the first of these gentlemen, \u015euh\u1e25-i-Ezel is still living at Famagusta. He is described as \u201cevidently a man of rank,\u201d and it is further stated that he makes no use of the freedom granted him by the British Government, from which he receives a pension. He never even appears out of doors. Mr. Cobham was kind enough to refer to the Government Estimates for 1884\u20135, and 1889\u201390, and to communicate to me the results of his investigations, which showed that \u015euh\u1e25-i-Ezel\u2019s pension had been reduced during that period from \u00a3105 6s. to \u00a361 16s. During the same period Mushk\u00edn Kalam\u2019s pension sunk from \u00a358 17s. to \u00a320 13s. He came from Nicosia to Larnaca towards the end of 1885, and remained at the latter place till September 14th, 1886, when he left Cyprus for Acre. He has two sons: one, \u2018Al\u00ed, accompanied him to Acre; the other, Jel\u00e1lu\u2019d-D\u00edn, is still in Cyprus, and is in the employment of the British Government as Land Registry clerk. Mushk\u00edn Kalam\u2019s real name was \u201cAli-ed-Din Hussein.\u201d\n\nThe information supplied by Captain Young is still more detailed. The day after he received the letter of inquiry which I had addressed to him, he paid a visit to \u015euh\u1e25-i-Ezel in person, and of this interview he was kind enough to forward me a circumstantial account. On the following day he received a visit from \u015euh\u1e25-i-Ezel\u2019s son, whom he describes as \u201can intelligent young man about 30 years old,\u201d and from him obtained further information. I would gladly quote Captain Young\u2019s letter *in extenso*, but the length which this Article has already attained forbids me to do so, and I must necessarily confine myself to a statement of the more important facts which it embodies, some of which are incorporated in the foot-note on p. 887.\n\u015eubh-i-Ezel is described by Captain Young as \"a slightly-built man of about 5ft. 6in., with a fine-cut handsome face, and a large beard.\" His name is M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1, and he was born at Teher\u00e1n. His father, named \u2018Abb\u00e1s, was better known as M\u00edrz\u00e1 Buzurg, and was \"second to the Grand Vizier in Persia.\" Beh\u00e1 and \u015eubh-i-Ezel are step-brothers, born of one father but different mothers. \u015eubh-i-Ezel was sent to Cyprus apparently in 1868,\\(^1\\) together with his wives and children, numbering twelve in all. Muskh\u00edn Kalam with his family, numbering four in all, were also sent there at the same time. These were all the B\u00e1bis sent to Cyprus. \u015eubh-i-Ezel's pension from the British Government at present amounts to \u00a37 1s. 6d. per month of thirty-one days, and about 4s. 6d. less per month of thirty days.\n\nSome of the statements made by me in my first Article were criticized by \u015eubh-i-Ezel as follows:\n\n(p. 490) \"There were three B\u00e1bis killed through Sheyk B\u00e1kir. The name of the one not mentioned was Mull\u00e1 K\u00e1zim.\n\n(p. 498) The B\u00e1b\u00ed salutation among themselves is the same as the Muhammadan. The women not the men say All\u00e1hu Abh\u00e1 as well as All\u00e1hu Akbar.\n\n(p. 499) The B\u00e1bis do keep Ram\u00e1zan as well as Nawruz.\n\n(p. 499) Circumcision is not abolished by the B\u00e1bis.\n\n(p. 501) Wine is prohibited by the Ezel\u00eds, but not by the Beh\u00e1'\u00eds.\n\n(p. 517) Of the Ezel\u00eds killed at Aere: H\u00e1ji Seyyid Huseyn of K\u00e1sh\u00e1n, and M\u00edrz\u00e1 Haydar \u2018Al\u00ed of Ardist\u00e1n were not amongst them. They were killed previously at Baghd\u00e1d. The full name of M\u00edrz\u00e1 R\u00edz\u00e1 is Mirz\u00e1 R\u00edz\u00e1 Kul\u00ed. The others mentioned were killed at Aere by Beh\u00e1\u2019s followers, and there were besides Huseyn \u2018Al\u00ed and H\u00e1j\u00ed M\u00edrz\u00e1 A\u1e25mad, both of K\u00e1sh\u00e1n.\n\n\\(^1\\) This is according to a note made by Captain Young\u2019s predecessor in 1879, which states that \u015eubh-i-Ezel and Muskh\u00edn Kalam have both been in the island eleven years. \u015eubh-i-Ezel\u2019s own statement to Captain Young is as follows: \"I was sent here twenty-three years ago. I may have said in 1879 that I had been here eleven years then, but it is twenty-three years now according to Persian years.\"\nI forget at present the names of the others, but about twenty of my followers were killed by Beh\u00e1'\u00eds at Acre.\"\n\nBesides this information, and much more of almost equal value, Captain Young succeeded in obtaining from \u0160ubh-i-Ezel a MS. work (of which, as I have not yet had time to study it, I must reserve the description for some other occasion), and a document of great historical interest, viz. the appointment of \u0160ubh-i-Ezel by the B\u00e1b as his successor. This is, I believe, copied directly from the original in \u0160ubh-i-Ezel's possession. As it is too valuable to be omitted, and is, moreover, quite short, I subjoin the text and translation.\n\n[Text of \u0160ubh-i-Ezel's Appointment as B\u00e1b's Successor.]\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0643\u0628\u0631 \u062a\u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631\u0627\u064b \u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631\u0627\u064b\n\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u064a\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0648\u0645\n\u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u064a\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0648\u0645\n\u0642\u0644 \u0643\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u064a\u0639\u0648\u062f\u0648\u0646\n\n\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0646\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0630\u0643\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0644\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0646\n\u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0646 \u064a\u0639\u062f\u0644 \u0627\u0633\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062d\u064a\u062f \u0630\u0643\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0644\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0646\n\u0642\u0644 \u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u0646\u0642\u0637\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u064a\u0628\u062f\u0626\u0648\u0646\n\n\u0625\u0646 \u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062d\u064a\u062f \u0641\u0627\u062d\u0641\u0638 \u0645\u0627 \u0646\u0632\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646\n\u0648\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0628\u0647 \u0641\u0627\u0646\u0643 \u0644\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0639 \u062d\u0642 \u0639\u0638\u064a\u0645\n\n(\u0627\u0645\u0636\u0627)\n\n[Translation of the Same.]\n\n\"God is Most Great with the Uttermost Greatness.\n\nThis is a letter on the part of God, the Protector, the Self-Existent.\n\nTo God, the Protector, the Self-Existent.\n\nSay, \u2018all originate from God.\u2019\n\nSay \u2018all return unto God.\u2019\nThis is a letter from \u2018Ali before Neb\u00edl, the Remembrance of God unto the Worlds.\n\nUnto him whose name is equivalent to the Name of the One (wah\u00edd = 28), the Remembrance of God unto the Worlds.\n\nSay, \u2018Verily all originate from the Point of Revelation\u2019 (Nukta-i-Bey\u00e1n).\n\nO Name of the One!

Verily thou art a Mighty Way of Truth.\u201d\n\n(Signature).\n\nThe document from which the above text is taken is endorsed by Captain Young as follows: \u201cCopy of Appointment of \u0160ub\u1e25-i-Ezel as B\u00e1b\u2019s successor, original written by B\u00e1b.\u201d I will only make the following observations on it.\n\nThe B\u00e1b calls himself \u201c\u2018Ali before Neb\u00edl\u201d (i.e. \u2018Ali Neb\u00edl), instead of \u2018Ali Muhammad, which is his proper name. Neb\u00edl is chosen as an equivalent of Muhammad, the numerical value of either word being the same (92) according to the abjad notation. Of these substitutions the B\u00e1bis are very fond, and this same document, short as it is, furnishes us with another instance. \u0160ub\u1e25-i-Ezel is not addressed by his proper name, Yahy\u00e1, but is described as \u201che whose name is equivalent to the One\u201d (wah\u00edd), because the numerical equivalent of both \u0648\u062d\u06cc\u062f and \ufe9f\ufee4\ufef4 is the same, viz. 28. I have already discussed the important part played by the abjad notation in the B\u00e1bi theology (p. 39\u201348), which has also been fully treated of by Gobineau. This document furnishes us with the grounds whereon \u0160ub\u1e25-i-Ezel\u2019s claims to be the B\u00e1b\u2019s vicegerent are based. The reasons why the appointment is considered as cancelled by the Beh\u00e1\u2019\u00eds have been mentioned in my first Article (p. 515). They admit that M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1 was the vicegerent of the B\u00e1b, but declare that his right to exercise authority ceased on the appearance of \u2018He whom God shall manifest\u2019 and the commencement of the new dispensation which he ushered in. That \u2018He whom\nGod shall manifest\u2019 has the right to assume the fullest authority\u2014this authority extending to the abrogation of old and the addition of new ordinances\u2014is conclusively proved by the Bey\u00e1n itself. The whole question on which the B\u00e1bi schism hinges is therefore this: \u201cIs Beh\u00e1 \u2018He whom God shall manifest,\u2019 or not? If he is, then \u015euh\u1e25-i-Ezel\u2019s appointment ceases to be valid. If not, then \u015euh\u1e25-i-Ezel is undoubtedly the B\u00e1b\u2019s chosen successor.\u201d\n\nI cannot lose this opportunity of expressing my warmest thanks to Captain Young, Mr. C. D. Cobham, and Mr. Houston for the ready help they have given me in my researches, and the valuable information with which they have supplied me. The promptitude with which their inquiries were set on foot, the care with which they were conducted, and the value of the results obtained, were only equalled by the ready courtesy with which they undertook the investigation. I also desire to express my gratitude to Mr. A. A. Bevan, of Trinity College, Cambridge, for his kindness in assisting me to revise most of the passages translated from the Arabic, whereby several serious errors have been corrected, and many emendations made.\n\nOne more remark must be added. In my first Article (p. 517, note) I stated that a rumour had reached me from Beyrout to the effect that Beh\u00e1 was dead. The correspondent who informed me of this report has since written to contradict it on the authority of no less a person than Beh\u00e1\u2019s son, \u2018Abb\u00e1s Efend\u00ed.\n\nIII. THE LAST B\u00c1BI MARTYR.\n\nThose who were present at the Meeting of the Society on April 15th, 1889, at which my first paper was read, will remember that in the discussion which followed it, General Houtum-Schindler stated that a B\u00e1bi had been put to death at Isfah\u00e1n in October, 1888. In reply to inquiries which I made of my friends in Persia, I received a little time ago a letter containing an account of this event, of a portion of which I here give the translation:\n\"You wrote that you had heard from General Schindler of the martyrdom of one of this sect. The details are these. A child, who was one of the servants of the *andar\u00fam* (women's apartments) of the Prince Zill-es-Sult\u00e1n, had become acquainted with several individuals of 'the friends' (*alb\u00e1b*), and \u00c1k\u00e1 M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ashraf of Ab\u00e1d\u00e9 had apprized him of this Matter (*i.e.* had converted him to B\u00e1bi\u00edsm). News of this reaches the Prince Zill-es-Sult\u00e1n. They torment the child to make him tell the truth, but he in no wise discloses the matter. Guile enters the hearts of the Prince's servants. One of them goes and inquires of several of 'the friends,' 'Where is \u00c1k\u00e1 M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ashraf? I have a wife in Ab\u00e1d\u00e9, and I desire to send to her a letter and some money. Since \u00c1k\u00e1 M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ashraf has acquaintances in Ab\u00e1d\u00e9, I wish to send them by means of him.' These, believing this representation, point out to him the abode of \u00c1k\u00e1 M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ashraf. When they recognize \u00c1k\u00e1 M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ashraf, they seize him and bring him into the presence of the Prince. The Prince inquires of \u00c1k\u00e1 M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ashraf, 'Art thou of this sect?' He answers, 'I am not.' He says, 'If thou art not, curse' (them, or the B\u00e1b, or Beh\u00e1). He replies, 'Since their wickedness has not been made apparent to me, I will not curse' (them). Eventually the Prince obtains a decision from several of the *Ulam\u00e1*, and telegraphs to Teher\u00e1n, 'If this person be not killed, the *Ulam\u00e1* and the populace will raise disturbance: the *Ulam\u00e1*, moreover, have pronounced sentence: he himself, also, has confessed that he is of this sect, and it is necessary to kill him to quiet the people.' The order comes from Teher\u00e1n, 'Do whatever appears desirable.' Then the Prince orders the execution of \u00c1k\u00e1 M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ashraf. According to the accounts I have heard, they cut off his head and then gibbet him. Afterwards they set fire to his body. I myself was acquainted with \u00c1k\u00e1 M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ashraf. . . . His age seemed to be about sixty. He was a man of understanding and education; a good calligraphist; and extremely courteous and amiable. . . . In every way he was a most excellent man.\"\nIV. B\u00e1b\u00ed Literature.\n\nAlthough I have had occasion to refer to almost all the B\u00e1b\u00ed works known to me in the course of one or other of my Articles, it appears to me desirable, as a means of facilitating future studies of this subject, to recapitulate briefly the titles of these, and, in the case of such as have not been elsewhere described, to add the opening and concluding passages in the original, so that the identification of B\u00e1b\u00ed MSS. may be rendered easier.\n\nA.

A MS. of this work numbered Or. 2820 exists in the British Museum. It contains a short commentary on some of the more difficult passages, especially the very obscure section relating to inheritance. Of this work I possess three MSS., two from Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, and one from Kirm\u00e1n.

Besides them there are numerous short epistles written to different private individuals, generally believers; sometimes, as in the case of the \u0644\u0648\u062d \u0634\u064a\u062e \u0628\u0627\u0642\u0631, to enemies and persecutors.

Of some of these I possess copies which I hope to publish subsequently.\n\nV. Transliteration.\n\nConsiderations into which it is needless to enter having induced me, though somewhat against my own inclinations, to employ only the Roman character in the earlier part of this article, reserving the Arabic type for the last pages, it is necessary to add a few words of apology and explanation.\n\nTransliteration of Arabic is especially unsatisfactory, involving as it does not only disputed questions of pronunciation, but also the necessity of supplying vowel-points, which are not as a rule given in the texts, and are sometimes doubtful. As I have no knowledge of spoken Arabic, I have, in the transliteration of all Arabic passages, followed in the main the system laid down by my former teacher, the late Professor Palmer, in his Arabic Manual, which appears to me at least as good as any other. In only one point am I conscious of a certain amount of irregularity, viz. in the transliteration of the fat\u1e25a. This is usually represented by \\( \\alpha \\); but in certain words which occurred continually throughout the article, and in which \\( e \\) seemed to me more accurately to indicate\nthe current pronunciation, I have allowed the latter to stand, even when the word occurred in a passage cited in the original, e.g. \u0628\u064f\u0647\u064e\u0649 is written Beh\u00e1, not Bah\u00e1; \u0628\u0650\u06cc\u0627\u0646 Bey\u00e1n, not Bay\u00e1n.\n\nAs regards the Persian, I knew of no system which I was prepared to adopt in its entirety. Those employed in France and Germany seemed unsuitable by reason of the more complicated representation of the consonants rendered necessary by the peculiarities of those languages, while those devised in England have usually been constructed with the view of indicating the pronunciation of Persian as spoken by natives of India.\n\nSo far as concerns the consonants, I have followed the system laid down by Forbes in his Persian Grammar with the following exceptions:\n\n(1) \u0634 is represented by s instead of \u0161.\n(2) \u0639 is represented by ' instead of '.\n(3) \u0638, \u0636, and \u0630 are alike represented by z. It would no doubt have been better to distinguish them as Forbes has done, but since they occur for the most part in words which will be immediately recognized by any one with a knowledge of the language, it appeared to me unnecessary to introduce further complications into the typography, especially as the total amount of transliterated Persian in the article is but small.\n\n(4) \u0621 is usually represented by v, sometimes by w.\n\nAs regards the vowels, those which are long are marked with an acute accent, and the majh\u00fal sounds of o and e peculiar to India are discarded. When e is used, it represents fat\u1e25a, which, however, is usually transliterated a, with the exceptions above specified; at the end of words \u00e9 represents s pointed with fat\u1e25a, and sometimes with kesr\u0101, e.g. ch\u00e9 for \u0686\u0647.\nART. XIII.\u2014The Early Pallavas of Kanchipur\u0101. By the Reverend T. Foulkes, M.R.A.S., etc., Retired Senior Chaplain, Madras Establishment.\n\nThe remarkable Pallava inscription edited by Professor G. B\u00fchler in the first number of the \"Epigraphia Indica\" very appropriately inaugurates that new publication, not only because it is the earliest copper-plate muniment which has hitherto been discovered in India, presuming the argument for its date in this present paper is sound, but more especially because its contemporaneous evidence stamps the rule of the Pallavas in Southern India at that early time with historical certainty. Moreover, it supplies authentic materials for an outline sketch of the condition of the Pallava region of the Dakhan at this period of its ancient history, and its political, religious, and social institutions, and of its intellectual and literary advancement.\n\nThis document is a renewal of a previous grant of a garden made by an earlier king, Bappa, whose name has already appeared in the inscriptions of the Pallavas, to several Brahmans of various ancestral lineage in certain specified shares, and free from all taxes; to which was now added a new grant of a piece of land in a neighbouring village for a threshing-floor, and of another piece for house-sites, together also with four cultivating labourers, and two other agricultural serfs attached to the soil; this endowment being created for the increase of the merit, longevity, power, and fame of the donor's family and race. The grant was issued from Kanchipur\u0101, the modern Conjeveram, 46 miles southwest from Madras, and it is dated on the fifth day of the sixth fortnight of the rainy season in the year eight of the donor's reign. The grantor is the righteous supreme great king of kings of the Pallava race, \u015aivaskanda-varman, a\nmember of the spiritual guild of the rishi Bharadv\u00e1ja, and an offerer of the Agnishtoma, V\u00e1japeya, and \u00c1\u015bvamedha vedic sacrifices. The entire body of the inscription is in an old form of Pr\u00e1krit; but a short benediction in Sanskrit is added at its close, and the king's name on the seal is also written in its Sanskrit form.\n\nWith regard to the date of the grant, Professor B\u00fchler remarks that \"it is impossible to say how the donor is connected with the other Pallava kings known from the s\u00e1sanas as yet published, or to fix the period when he reigned;\" but he derives an argument for a tentative early date from the circumstance of its being written in Pr\u00e1krit. There are, however, in addition to this language-clue, two other clues to its date incidentally embodied in its statements. One of them is of a very general character, and, like the language-clue, merely suggests in a vague way some very early date; but the other will, I think, supply the key to certain definite limits of time within which its date must fall:\n\n(1) King \u015aivaskanda-varman had offered the horse-sacrifice (\u00e1\u015bvamedha), a sacrifice which Samudra-gupta, about A.D. 365, boasts of having revived after it \"had been long in abeyance.\"\u00b9 Nobody will maintain that this present Pallava grant is of later date than the fourth century A.D., and so it follows, howsoever indefinitely, from that boast, that \u015aivaskanda-varman lived \"long\" before Samudra-gupta.\n\n(2) The second clue is derived from the circumstance of the date of the grant being stated in the peculiar form of the serial fortnights of the year of three seasons, spring, summer, and winter; and to follow it up, I proceed to trace the dynasty of kings by whom this special system of dating was adopted, and the period of time in which it was used.\n\nWith regard to the Pallava inscriptions which have hitherto been published, I find that out of the fifteen documents attributed to the kings of this race, only five of them exhibit their dates, the rest being either without date originally, or their dates have been obliterated or lost.\n\n\u00b9 Journ. Roy. Asiat. Soc. Vol. XXI. (n.s.), p. 619.\nFour of these five are dated uniformly on the lunar days of the waxing and waning lunar fortnights of the twelve lunar months in the serial years of the king's reign; and the fifth,\u00b9 my grant of Pallava-malla, omits the months and days, and has simply the regnal year of the king. This method of dating by lunar fortnights, lunar months, and regnal years may therefore be regarded as the established system of the Pallavas during the period which these inscriptions cover, namely, from the fourth century\u00b2 downwards, and probably somewhat earlier.\n\nThe inscriptions of the Ch\u00e1lukya kings during the same period are similarly dated for the minor divisions of time, but in them the continuous era of \u015a\u00e1liv\u00e1hana is used for the years, in the place of the regnal years of the kings.\n\nIt is to be observed here that the lunar fortnights of these two systems are of a quite different character from the solar serial fortnights of the system of our present Pallava grant. I must also add that, with one solitary partial exception to be noticed presently, no trace of this latter system has hitherto been met with of so late a date as the fourth century A.D. We may therefore proceed to examine the period before that date, in order to discover at what time this peculiar method of season-fortnights was used as a formal division of time.\n\nThe dates of the inscriptions of the early Guptas have the same minor divisions of time as the Ch\u00e1lukya grants; but for the years they use an era of their own in the place of that of \u015a\u00e1liv\u00e1hana. For this group we have examples in the inscriptions of Chandra-gupta, Skanda-gupta, and Budha-gupta.\u00b3 There is, however, an irregularity in the method of this series. Buddha-gupta's grant adds the week day; one of Toram\u00e1na's\u2074 is dated like the above four Pallava grants; and one of Skanda-gupta's\u2075 uses the days of the lunar fortnights of the serial lunar months of the year of\n\n\u00b9 Indian Antiquary, vol. viii. p. 273; Salem Manual, vol. ii. p. 355.\n\u00b2 See the heading to plate xxiv. of Burnell's South Indian Palaeography.\n\u00b3 Journ.

These Gupta inscriptions thus belong to the transition period when the older system was working out and the newer system working in.\n\nAscending beyond the Guptas into the Satrap period, we still find the same minor divisions of time as in the Gupta and Ch\u00e1lukya documents; the years of the Satrap inscriptions are expressed in the continuous series of an era which was probably their own. The inscription of Gonophares adds to this the regnal year of this ruler. Instances of this group occur in the inscriptions of Nahap\u00e1na, where the month and day are omitted, Usavad\u00e1ta, Rudra-d\u00e1ma, and Rudra-sena.\\(^1\\)\n\nWe come next to the period of the Indo-Scythian kings, ranging on both sides of the epoch of the Christian era. Eighteen inscriptions of this group belong to the magnificent finds of Sir Alexander Cunningham at Mathura.\\(^2\\) They are respectively dated on the 4th, 5th, 11th, 12th, 16th, 20th, and 30th days of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th months of the three seasons, Gr\u00edshma, Varsha, and Hemanta. Here we find an approach to the system used in our present Pallava grant, but with these important differences: (1) that the Indo-Scythian system uses the whole-month days, from one to thirty, of the serial months of the three seasons, while our Pallava grant uses the days of the serial fortnights of those seasons; and (2) that it uses the continuous years of a Samvat era, whereas this Pallava grant uses the regnal year of the king. Another point of distinction may also be noted, namely, that all these Indo-Scythian inscriptions are written in the Sanskrit language, although, as must also be borne in mind, the coins of this dynasty have Pr\u00e1krit legends.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Early History of the Dekhan, pp. 13, 17, 19; Arch.

Four inscriptions of this class occur at K\u00e1nheri, near Bombay, of the times of Gotamiputra S\u00e1takarn\u012b, S\u00e1kasena, M\u0101dhariputra Sirisena, and Gotamiputra \u015ar\u012b-yajna-S\u00e1takarn\u012b.\u00b9 Four more occur at K\u00e1rle, at the head of the B\u00f3rgh\u00e1t leading up from the Bombay coast to the plains of the Dakhan, belonging to the reign of Pulum\u00e1yi.\u00b2 Six other inscriptions belonging to this king\u2019s reign occur at N\u00e1sik,\u00b3 another at Amar\u00e1vat\u00ed,\u2074 and another at N\u00e1nagh\u00e1t.\u2075 One of the reign of \u015ar\u012b S\u00e1ta-karn\u012b occurs on the southern gateway of the S\u00e1nchi tope.\u2076 N\u00e1sik has also one of the reign of King Krish\u1e47a,\u2077 two of the reign of Gotamiputra S\u00e1takarn\u012b,\u2078 and one of \u015ar\u012b-yajna S\u00e1takarn\u012b.\u2079 There is another inscription of the last-named king in the Madras Museum, which was found at Chinna-Ganj\u00e1n, I presume, on the sea-shore in the Kistna District.\u00b9\u2070 One of the time of H\u00e1ritiputra S\u00e1takarn\u012b has been found at B\u00e1nav\u00e1si,\u00b9\u00b9 on the route of the great western ford of Harihara on the Tungabhadra, and one of M\u0101dhariputra Purisadatta, if it belongs to this group, at Jagayyapett,\u00b9\u00b2 on the route of the great\n\n\u00b9 Journ.

It can be traced downwards, as the above notes show, through the surviving monuments of each succeeding dynasty of kings down to the early Guptas, during whose ascendancy it appears to have passed away. But each of these dynasties had its own separate method of arranging the minor subdivisions of the seasons:\n(1) The Vedic Br\u00e1hmans and the early Buddhists used this measure of time as a mere secondary distribution of their lunar year of twelve months, with the serial days of their demi-lunations, together with the regnal years of the kings.\n\n(2) The Indo-Scythians used it in combination with the years of a Samvat era, and with a subdivision of the three seasons into serial months of apparently thirty days each.\n\n(3) The Skanda-Gupta variation differs from the Indo-Scythian system by dividing the serial lunar months of the three seasons into demi-lunations, thus reverting from the solar to the lunar chronological method.\n\n(4) The Andhrabhrityas divided the three seasons into serial solar fortnights running throughout each season, and without reference to any months.\n\nDown to the appearance of this new Pallava grant, this last method of distributing the three seasons appeared to be confined to the usage of the Andhrabhrityas; we now learn that it was used by the Pallava kings of K\u00e1nch\u00edpura, also in that period of their history to which this grant belongs.\n\nThese facts having been thus ascertained, I will now resume my argument. It may be fairly presumed that a grant dated after so peculiar a method may rightly claim to belong to the period when that method is known to have prevailed. On this principle this new Pallava grant is to be assigned to the period of the rule of the Andhrabhrityas, namely to some time between 73 B.C. and 218 A.D.\u00b9\n\nBut we can arrive at a more definite approximate date within this period by another method. The Andhrabhritya inscriptions in which this system is used by kings whose dates can be ascertained, are those of Gotamiputra S\u00e1takar\u1e47i, Pulum\u00e1yi, Sirisena, and \u015ar\u00ed-yaj\u00f1a S\u00e1takar\u1e47i. The first and the last of these names occur on the lists of the kings of this dynasty in the V\u00e1yu, M\u00e1tsya, Bh\u00e1gavata, Brahm\u00e1nda, and Vish\u1e47u Pur\u00e1\u1e47as; and the other two names, though omitted in the V\u00e1yu, are given in the other four Pur\u00e1\u1e47as.\n\n\u00b9 See Early History of the Dekkan, p. 29.\nwith slight variations of form. The V\u00e1yu, M\u00e1tsya, and Brahm\u00e1nda give the number of years of each king's reign; and from these numbers as given in the V\u00e1yu Pur\u00e1\u1e47a, and assuming, on grounds derived from other data, that the first king of this list began to reign in B.C. 73, the commencement of the reign of H\u00e1la, the seventh of the V\u00e1yu list, falls in A.D. 77. This name, H\u00e1la, is, on the high authority of Hemachandra's dictionary, a synonym of \u015a\u00e1liv\u00e1hana; and the epoch of the era of \u015a\u00e1liv\u00e1hana, which is generally prevalent in Southern India, is A.D. 78, or virtually identical with the commencement of his reign according to the data of the V\u00e1ya Pur\u00e1\u1e47a. Calculating from this date, Gotamiputra \u015a\u00e1takarn\u012b began to reign in A.D. 133, according to the number of years in the V\u00e1ya Pur\u00e1\u1e47a; or in A.D. 121, according to those of the M\u00e1tsya; or in A.D. 134, according to those of the Brahm\u00e1nda Pur\u00e1\u1e47a; and Yaj\u00f1a\u015br\u012b \u015a\u00e1takarn\u012b's accession fell in A.D. 154 according to the V\u00e1yu, or in A.D. 184 according to the M\u00e1tsya; or in A.D. 196, according to the Brahm\u00e1nda Pur\u00e1\u1e47a; while Pulum\u00e1yi (Pulimat, Puloman), and Sirisena occupied intermediate dates. By a calculation from a different set of materials Professor Bhandarkar arrived at the conclusion that \"Pulum\u00e1yi must have begun to reign, at the latest, about the year A.D. 130.\"\u00b9 We must not expect to arrive at the exact dates through any data at present available; it is enough to be able to say for the present that the chronological system which is used in the Pallava grant now under examination prevailed in the Dakha\u1e47 throughout the second century A.D.; and to some date in or about this period I propose, on these grounds, to assign this grant of Sivaskanda-varman.\n\nA question may very properly arise here whether there are any good reasons, independently of this grant, for placing the Pallavas in the Southern Dakha\u1e47 at this early period, and in such extensive power as this grant indicates. I think the answer of those who have followed the rapid\n\n\u00b9 Early Hist. Dek. p. 21.\nresuscitation of these long-lost kings during the last few years,\\(^1\\) will be that there is nothing at all startling in this discovery, since each successive accession of materials bearing upon their early history has made for this conclusion. K\u0101nchipura, from which the Pallava king issued this present grant, was known to Patanjali in the middle of the second century before the Christian era, and the Buddhist chronicles of Ceylon contain an early reference to the Pallavas which makes them the most considerable Buddhist power in India at that same period,\\(^2\\) while their geographical environments in the passage referred to require them to be placed in the Southern Dakha\u1e47.\n\nAssuming the correctness of the identification of the Pallavas with the pauranic Pahlavas, and of the Pahlavas with the Parthians, there are good historical grounds for supposing that Parthian colonies established themselves in the Dakha\u1e47 at a very early period. From the time of the separation of Bactria from Syria in the middle of the third century B.C., the tendency of the Baetrians, forced by the pressure of their western and northern neighbours, was to extend themselves southwards into India, and the Parthians, after their conquest of the Bactrians about a century later, followed up their successes by overrunning the Indian provinces of Baetria. The natural effect of this latter movement was to press the conquered Indo-Baetrians still further southwards and eastwards into India, with the concurrent tendency on the side of the Parthians always to follow up the retreat of their vanquished foes. After another interval, the Indo-Parthians were themselves forced out of their possessions in Afghanistan, the Panjab, and Upper India by the Scythian invasion, and their only possible refuge then was in the south. We can follow the footsteps of the refugees, by means of the inscriptions of the Kshatrapas, as far as the upper basin of the God\u0101v\u0101ri and the northern\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See my previous paper on the Pallavas in this Journal, Vol. XVII. (N.S.), p. 183, etc.\n\n\\(^2\\) B.C. 165, according to Turnour's calculations. See Upham's Sacred and Historical Books of Ceylon, vol. i. p. 152; Turnour's Mahawanso, p. 171.\ncoast of the Konkans; and when these substantial materials fail us in tracing their further progress southwards, the very natural conjecture arises that some one of the more enterprising of the defeated Parthian generals would adventure at the head of his remaining troops into the wide plains of the Dakha\u1e47 and carve out for himself a kingdom there, or, perhaps, enter into the service of the existing rulers of the Dakha\u1e47 as an auxiliary defensive ally, having some frontier province committed to him for the payment of his troops, and with the ultimate inevitable result of establishing his own independent rule there. At this point of our tentative theory we are met by the Ceylonese records showing the great growth of the power of these Parthian colonists at a sufficiently early time, whatever dates may hereafter be attached to the early kings of Ceylon. Then, for the early years of the Christian era, this new Pallava grant places us anew on the firm ground of history, and the vivid glimpse which it affords of the firmly-established power of the Pallavas, and of their institutions at that time, and their permanent character, is sufficient for the present to carry us through the succeeding interval down to the time of Fah Hian\u2019s visit to India, whose great \u2018Kingdom of the Dakhan\u2019 I ventured to claim for the Pallavas several years ago.\u00b9\n\nAn outline of this kind, pending the discovery of more definite materials to fill in the details, quite consistently prepares us for the next succeeding historical appearance of the Pallavas in Sir Walter Elliot\u2019s Vengi copper plates of Vijaya Nandi-varman and the subsequent inscriptions of the Ch\u0101lukyas, at whose arrival in the Dakha\u1e47 they found the Pallavas in possession of its western districts, as far at the least as the vicinity of Bad\u0101mi in the middle basin of the Krishna, and of its eastern districts as far north at least as R\u0101jahmahendri in the lower basin of the God\u0101var\u012b, and with their capital still at K\u0101nchipura, where \u0160ivaskanda-varman of our present grant reigned several centuries before.\n\nThe incidental statements of this grant furnish materials\n\n\u00b9 Ind. Ant. vol. vii. (1878), p. 1; vol. viii. p. 167.\nfor an outline sketch of the condition of the Pallava dominions in the reign of \u015aivaskanda-varman; and if the argument of this paper is as sound as I believe it to be, and his reign fell at any time about the end of the first century A.D., or the beginning of the second, that picture will apply to a sufficient time earlier to cover the period when that condition was being developed.\n\n(1) The power of the Pallavas was well established at that time. \u015aivaskanda-varman is styled \"supreme king of great kings,\" a title which implies paramount authority over other rulers subject to him; and the circumstance of his having offered the horse-sacrifice, which involved a claim and a challenge to supremacy, indicates his own personal appreciation of his great power. His predecessor, immediate or otherwise, King Bappa, was wealthy enough to make donations to the Brahmins of a hundred thousand ox ploughs, whatever the multiple of exaggeration may be, and many millions of gold coin.\n\n(2) They reigned at K\u0101\u00f1ch\u012bpura, a sacred old capital city which had already risen to fame in the reign of A\u015boka, in the third century before the Christian era.\n\n(3) The Pallava king was assisted in his government by \"ministers\" of state and \"privy councillors\"; and his throne was surrounded by \"royal princes.\"\n\n(4) Their dominions were very extensive; for, adopting the terms of Professor B\u00fchler's translation, they embraced \"countries\" governed by \"prefects,\" distributed into \"provinces\" administered by their \"lords,\" and subdivided into \"districts\" under the superintendence of their \"rulers.\"\n\n(5) Their fiscal arrangements included \"custom houses\" and \"officers\" of customs, and \"spies\" or itinerant superintendents of revenue. They had also some kind of forest department with its staff of \"foresters.\"\n\n(6) They maintained a standing army, the brigades of which were commanded by \"generals,\" and its minor groups of rank and file had their non-commissioned officers or \"naicks.\"\n\n(7) Their village lands were occupied by ryots (\"free-\nholders\u201d is a term which is inconsistent with the early land-tenures of India), who paid \u201ceighteen kinds\u201d of contributions to the crown, partly in kind and partly in money (\u201ctaxes\u201d). Amongst those which were paid in kind were \u201csweet and sour milk,\u201d \u201cgrass and wood,\u201d \u201cvegetables and flowers.\u201d They had also to plough the crown lands by turns with their \u201coxen in succession,\u201d and it was a part of their obligation to keep the roads and irrigation works in repair by a system of \u201cforced labour.\u201d \u201cSalt and sugar\u201d were royal monopolies; and these not infrequently involved the ryots in \u201ctroubles.\u201d\n\n(8) The crown had power to confer grants of land for religious uses, for \u201cthe increase of the merit, longevity, power, and fame of his own family and race,\u201d and to exempt the grantees and their grant-lands from the payment of the customary taxes.\n\n(9) When such land-grants were made, the agricultural \u201clabourers,\u201d and the \u201ckolikas\u201d or village staff, were transferred with the land.\n\n(10) These \u201clabourers\u201d received for their remuneration \u201chalf the produce,\u201d according to the system of v\u0101ram, which has survived in these parts down to the present day.\n\n(11) The present grant consists of a considerable extent of \u201cgarden\u201d land, sufficient to form an item in the income of twenty Brahmanical families, together with a detached threshing-floor and a site for houses in the neighbouring agrah\u0101ram where these grantees dwelt. The produce of this garden was divided amongst these grantees in thirty-four shares, ranging from one share to four shares each.\n\n(12) Though these grants were intended to be perpetual \u201cas long as the moon and stars endure,\u201d and the present grant was made as \u201ca charter valid for a hundred thousand years,\u201d this same garden of the present donation had been \u201cformerly given by the great king the Lord Bappa,\u201d either to these same grantees or some other Brahmans. The inference is that the grant had either been resumed by the crown in the meantime, or forfeited by the grantees; and this notwithstanding the minatory clauses appended to these grants.\n(13) The present grant was composed by a member of the king's \"privy council\" \"in his own handwriting,\" and handed over to the engraver for reproduction on the copper plates; it was then personally examined (\"seen\") by the king, and finally issued as his \"own order,\" with the accompanying confirmatory ceremony of the \"libation of water.\"\n\n(14) With regard to the literary condition of the Pallava dominions at this time, the present grant shows that this \"privy councillor\" and secretary was familiar with both the Sanskrit and Prakrit languages; and we may conclude from this that both these languages were cultivated at Kanchipuram at this time. Professor B\u00fchler has shown that the Prakrit of this grant \"comes close to the literary Pali,\" a circumstance which has some significance when tracing the history of the literature of the Southern Buddhists, especially when we bear in mind the intimate early intercourse between the Pallava region and Ceylon. Moreover, since this privy-councillor was a strict Vedic Brahman, as his final benediction specially shows, we may also conclude that the knowledge of Prakrit was not confined to the Buddhists, but was a Brahmanical accomplishment also.\n\n(15) Brahmins of the Atreya, Harita, Bharadvaja, Kausika, Kasyapa, and Vatsya gotras were settled in Southern India at the date of this grant, and for some time previously, dwelling together in agrahara communities, with a recognized \"chief\" of each community, and holding sarvamanya lands there under royal charters. The influence of these Brahmins at court is illustrated by the circumstance that one at least of their number was a privy councillor and the secretary of the king.\n\n(16) This last circumstance affords a proof that the Brahmins of this place and period did not confine themselves to spiritual duties, but were employed in secular affairs also. The management of their large garden and its produce, as well as of their grain-fields which peep at us through their new threshing-floor at Apitti, may probably enough have been committed to lay hands; but putting all\ntogether, it would appear that these early Brahmins of the Dakha\u1e47 lived in those days much as their descendants do now when they possess shares in agrah\u0101rams endowed with cultivated lands.\n\n(17) Whatever the religious condition of the subjects of the Pallavas may have been at this time, the present king was an observer of the ritual of the Vedas; he patronized the Brahmins after the example of at least one of his predecessors, and he was reckoned a member of the sacred clan of the ancient rishi Bharadv\u0101ja.\n\n(18) Both the members of this king\u2019s compound name, \u015aiva and Skanda, point to the \u015aaiva form of the Brahmanical religion as the creed of his parents when they gave him this name, or his own if it was assumed by himself. In either case it indicates the existence, and perhaps the prevalence, of this religious denomination in Southern India, and particularly at K\u0101nchipura and its court, in these early times. This conclusion is further illustrated by the circumstance that this same name of \u015aivaskanda was borne by one of the Andhrabhritya kings of the pauranic lists in the second century A.D.\n\nThis formulation of the information incidentally supplied by this grant shows us that the germs of those institutions which we see in their full development in the succeeding times, had already struck root firmly thus early. It remains to be discovered what of them the Pallavas brought with them into the Dakha\u1e47 from their northern homes, and what of them they found already established there. For the present this fortunate find has bridged over a great gap of unknown history,\u2014slenderly, but still surely,\u2014a gap which a short while ago seemed to be hopeless; for the life which it has revealed to us is in full touch, on the one hand, with the dawn of the history of all subsequent South Indian life; while, on the other hand, it is in contact with the sunset of the older life set up in India by Alexander the Great and his successors. The key to the transition period seems to be now in our hands, and we may be content to wait hopefully for fuller information in similar fortunate finds in the future.\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\n(July-September, 1889.)\n\nI.

Obituary Notices.\n\nProfessor Beal.\u2014The death is announced of the Rev. Samuel Beal, D.C.L., the distinguished Oriental scholar, and Professor of Chinese in the London University. Dr. Beal was born in 1825, and was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1847, being made Hon. D.C.L. of Durham in 1885. He took priest's orders, and was appointed a chaplain in the Royal Navy in 1852. Placed on the retired list in 1887, he became rector of Greens-Norton, Towcester, in 1888. After holding several curacies and various clerical appointments in the Navy in the earlier portion of his career, he was rector of Falstone, Northumberland, 1877-80, and rector of Wark-on-Tyne, 1880-88. He was appointed Professor of Chinese in University College, London, in 1877. Dr. Beal was the author of \"Travels of Buddhist Pilgrims,\" from the Chinese, 1869; \"Catena of Buddhist Scriptures,\" from the Chinese, 1872; \"Romantic Legend of Buddha,\" 1875; \"Five Lectures delivered at University College, London,\" 1876; \"Dhamma Pada, or Texts from the Buddhist Canon,\" 1878; \"Sacred Books of the East,\" published by the Clarendon Press, Oxford; \"Buddhism in China,\" issued in the non-Christian series of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, 1881; and \"Records of the Western World,\" an important work published in Tr\u00fcbner's Oriental Series, 1881.\n\nMichele Amari.\u2014The 'Times' of the 27th July says: \"Our Naples Correspondent writes: A great man has passed away in Florence in the last week, Michele Amari, well known to foreigners as to Italians by the invaluable productions of his pen. In 1834, when only 28 years of age, he published 'La Fondazione dei Normanni in Sicilia.' In 1836, by the study of documents, he threw new light on the 'Vespers.' In 1841 he published researches into the archives of the island, under the title of 'Un periodo della Storia Siciliana nel Secolo XIII.' But the author and the book were both persecuted by the Bourbons; by orders from Naples the book was prohibited and the editor imprisoned. Amari was called\nto Naples, but knowing what it meant, he went to Paris, where he published the 'Vespers' under the real title; it was translated into English by Lord Ellesmere, and into German by Herr Schr\u00f6der. Retaining his bodily strength and mental faculties to the last, Amari died just as he had completed his 83rd year, honoured and lamented by all as a true patriot and a man of great literary distinction.' Senator Michele Amari was an honorary member of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nIV. Notes and News.\n\nThe Oriental Congress at Stockholm.\u2014The Congress has passed off with great success. The numbers in attendance were unusually large; the hospitality with which they were entertained most generous. A list of the papers read has reached the Society, but a detailed criticism is reserved until they are published in full.\n\nIndian Chess.\u2014Professor Weber has just published, in the Introduction to Bilgner's 'Handbuch des Schachs,' the matured results of his researches into the history and details of Indian Chess, or Caturanga.\n\nThe 'Arabian Nights' in India.\u2014In the 'Sitzungs-Berichte' of the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences for July, 1889, Professor Albrecht Weber publishes an analysis of the Sam-yaktra-Kaumudi, a Jain story book (existing in several recensions), which bears a striking resemblance, more especially in its framework and introduction, to the 1001 Nights. The distinguished Professor, after discussing with his usual acumen and mastery of detail, the relation of the recensions one to another, and of the oldest form of the story with the famous Arab work, comes to the conclusion that the Indian story book must have been derived from the same Buddhist sources as the Arabian one, so far that is as the resemblance between the two extends. As is well known the Arabian Nights were probably written in Egypt about 1400 A.D., and were based on material derived from Persia. A great deal of this material again, according to Persian tradition, came\nin its turn from India. One or two Jataka stories have been traced in the 'Nights,' but no Indian counterpart had hitherto been found for the setting of the stories. Professor Weber has therefore added a new and interesting chapter to the wonderful story of the stories, the history of the migration of Folk lore. The brochure is dedicated to the memory of Michele Amari.\n\nMr. Fleet's 'Inscriptions of the Gupta Kings,' vol. iii. of the 'Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum,' has at length appeared. A notice of this important work, by Professor B\u00fchler of Vienna, was to have appeared in this number, but it has not reached us at the time of our going to press.\n\nThe Persika of Ktesias.\u2014Professor Sayce has, in the 'Academy' of October 5th, an appreciative review of Mr. Gilmore's new edition of the existing fragments of this lost work. While regretting that Mr. Gilmore is not an Assyriologist, and differing from him in his estimate of the value of the work, he points out how important an aid to the study of the ancient history of Persia the new volume will certainly be.\n\nColonel Pentsoff.\u2014It is reported that this Russian officer's attempt to enter Tibet from the Kashgar side has been stopped by the Chinese. In the 'Nineteenth Century' of this month there is a very interesting description of Lh\u0101s\u0101 as it now is, chiefly compiled from the journals of Charat Sunder Das.\n\nThe Tod MSS.\u2014Dr. Wilhelm Cartellieri, a pupil of Dr. B\u00fchler, is at present in London consulting these MSS. at the rooms of the Asiatic Society.\n\n'The Jews of the Far East, or the Jews of Extreme Eastern Diasporu.'\u2014The 'London and China Telegraph' announces that the Rev. A. K. Clover, of Boston, is about to publish a work under this title, which will contain the original Chinese texts of the inscriptions discovered at Kai-feng-f\u016b.\n\nMr. Rockhill, of the American Embassy at Pekin, the well-known Tibetan scholar, having attempted to enter Tibet from the Chinese side, has written from Chunkiang, in Sechuan, on his way back to Pekin. It is not known as yet whether he succeeded in penetrating into Tibet.\nProfessorships in Germany.\u2014Professor Jacobi, the distinguished Jain scholar, has been appointed to the Professorship at Bonn, vacant by the retirement of Professor Aufrecht. Professor Oldenberg, of Berlin, will succeed Professor Jacobi at Kiel. Professor Deussen, the author of the best book on the Ved\u00e2nta, will also go to Kiel as professor of philosophy.\n\nThe Frescoes at Sigiri.\u2014The frescoes at Sigiri have long been talked about and known as one of the sights of Ceylon, but it has been left to Mr. A. Murray, of the Public Works Department, to make himself famous by taking a copy of this ancient work of art. Never before, as far as is known, has this feat been accomplished, owing to the precipitous nature of the rock at the top of which the frescoes are painted, and to the fact that the frescoed part overhangs considerably. Nevertheless, Mr. Murray succeeded in scaling the rock time after time, and has produced what are said to be some capital sketches of the frescoes. The painting represents thirteen women\u2014wives of one of the Tamil Kings of Ceylon\u2014and all are said to have been painted in charming proportions. Each figure is painted three-quarter length, that is to say, down to the knees, and there is no doubt from the complexions, the dress, and the general characteristics that the women are meant to be Tamil females. This is still further shown by the ornaments which the women wear on their necks, indicating that they are married. The frescoes, it is said, are in splendid condition, and the colours have stood wonderfully well. Mr. Murray, we hear, brought a piece of the plaster on which the fresco is painted down with him, and an analysis of this reveals that a great quantity of straw was used in its composition. Thus far Mr. Murray has secured only sketches of each figure; but we understand that he has made notes of the colours employed, and has commenced to fill in the colours. When the work is completed, it will be of considerable arch\u00e6ological value, and we hope to hear something about it at our Museum here or before the Asiatic Society. Mr. Murray risked life and limb to get it, and the Buddhist priests warned him over again that he would be killed before he had taken a sketch of the thirteenth\nwoman. He, however, has accomplished the feat, and the only explanation the Buddhists can give for the failure of their prophecy is that Mr. Murray must have scared the demons away. Whether he did or not, the fact remains that he has achieved a triumph, and one which archaeologists will be very grateful to him for.\u2014Ceylon Times.\n\nThe Oriental School in connection with the Imperial Institute.\u2014The Imperial Institute has taken some initial steps towards forming an Oriental School in London. The Councils of University and King's Colleges have been persuaded to place their Oriental teaching under the management of a joint committee of the three bodies. The teaching will be conducted, as previously, at the Colleges themselves, and by the existing teachers. As, however, there are a few modifications in the new list, it is here subjoined. In the absence of a real teaching University of London, perhaps no better plan could have been devised. Division I. Classes to be held at University College, London: Sanskrit, C. Bendall; Pali, T. W. Rhys Davids, LL.D., Ph.D.; Bengali, J. F. Blumhardt; Hindi, J. F. Blumhardt; Hindustani, J. F. Blumhardt; Tamil, J. Bradshaw; Marathi, H. Chintamon; Gujarati, S. A. Kapadia, M.D., L.R.C.P.; Arabic, C. Rieu, Ph.D., and H. A. Salmon\u00e9; Persian, C. Rieu, Ph.D. Division II. Classes to be held at King's College, London: Colloquial Arabic, Rev. Dr. J. L. Sabunjie; Chinese, R. K. Douglas; Burmese, General Ardagh; Modern Greek, M. Constantinides; Colloquial Persian, Sir Frederic Goldsmid; Japanese, F. V. Dickins, M.B., B.Sc.; Russian, N. Orloff, M.A.; Turkish, Charles Wells, Ph.D.; Swaheli, Archdeacon Farler (the Committee is in communication with this gentleman).\n\nThe seal of Jeremiah.\u2014Professor Sayce writes as follows to the Academy of the 5th October.\u2014\"Queen's College.\u2014M. Golenishcheff has kindly allowed me to describe a very remarkable seal which he purchased last winter in Cairo, which may therefrom be presumed to have been found somewhere in the Delta. The back is flat and plain, on the middle of the obverse are two blundered Egyptian cartouches, drawn horizontally, however, and not perpendicularly. In the\nupper cartouche is the following inscription in Phoenician letters: L-SH-L-M; in the lower is another in Phoenician letters: Y-R-M-Y-H-U. The two together read leshalom Yirmeyahu 'to the prosperity of Jeremiah.' The forms of the letters belong to the Phoenician, or rather the Israelitish, alphabet of the seventh century B.C. It is, therefore, possible that the seal may have been discovered on the site of Tel Defeneh or Tahpanhes, where a native was allowed by the authorities of the Bulaq Museum to excavate last year; and if so we may see in it an actual relic of the great Hebrew prophet. A copy of the seal is about to be published by M. Clermont-Ganneau.\n\nV. Reviews.\n\nLetter to the Disciple by Candragomin.\n\nIn the fourth volume of the 'Memoirs of the Oriental Section of the Imperial Russian Archaeological Society,' a journal in which many valuable contributions to Oriental literature in different branches have already appeared, Prof. Minayeff now gives us an edition of a Sanskrit poem ascribed to Candragomin, who is said to have sent it to a Prince Ratnakirti, and to have persuaded him thereby to forsake the world. This is the account given by Taranatha, and found also in Vairocanarakshita's commentary on the letter. (The Tibetan translation of this commentary is found in the same volume of the Sutra division of the Tanjur as that containing the letter itself, viz. vol. 94.)\n\nProf. Minayeff had published before, in the second volume of the same Journal, two short hymns, one to Avalokitevara (with some new remarks on that personality), and one to Buddha. But the present contribution outweighs them far in interest, as Candragomin is a celebrated name in Buddhist literature, and the author of many works, amongst which the Candra-vyakarana occupies a very high rank in the estimate of later, and even Brahmanical, authors. Dharmakirti, according to Taranatha, glories in being able to write\nin the style of Candragomin. The same T\u0101ran\u0101tha gives us the further data:\n\n1) That Candragomin heard Sthiramati, who is mentioned by Hiouen Thsang as dead, and one of whose works was translated into Chinese under the Northern Li\u0101ng dynasty A.D. 397\u2013439 (Bunyiu Nanjio, Catal. p. 273);\n\n2) That he wrote as a comment on P\u0101\u1e47ini the Candra-vy\u0101kara\u1e47a with supplements, which work is made use of in the K\u0101\u015bika of Jay\u0101ditya, who, according to Itsing, died in the middle of the seventh century (Kielhorn in Ind. Ant. 1886; Max M\u00fcller, India, p. 346);\n\n3) That he was an antagonist of Candrak\u012brti (in the commentary, mentioned above, of our letter, Ratnak\u012brti, the addressee, is called a pupil of Candrak\u012brti), with whom he quarrelled for seven years;\n\n4) And finally, as mentioned above, that he lived before Dharmak\u012brti, one of whose works is quoted by Subandhu, who again is mentioned by B\u0101\u1e47a, a contemporary of Hiouen Thsang (V\u0101savadatt\u0101, ed. Hall, p. 235, preface, p. 10, and Max M\u00fcller, India, p. 308).\n\nIn a passage of Itsing, translated by Mr. Ryauon Fujishima in the Journal Asiatique, Nov.\u2013Dec. 1888, but of which Prof. Vassilieff gives a slightly different, and apparently more trustworthy, version, some of the principal teachers are grouped in three classes: the old, the mediaeval, and those nearest the present time. Sthiramati is placed in the last of these classes, but Candragomin is not mentioned in them at all. On these data Prof. Minayeff comes to the probable conclusion that Candragomin lived in the fourth or the beginning of the fifth century A.D.\n\nThere is another passage from Itsing which Prof. Minayeff adduces as referring to Candragomin: \"In eastern India there lives a well known holy man called Ming Guan,\u00b9 who was still alive when I was there. Some people asked him 'What causes greater damage, a poisonous drug or a poisonous spectacle?' He answered, 'There is a wide\n\n\u00b9 As the present writer does not know Chinese, he can only transcribe the Russian characters.\ndifference between the two, a poisonous drug harms only if you eat it, but if you only think of a poisonous spectacle you burn.'\u201d (Here again the French translation deviates in a rather unaccountable way; the name of the man is given as Yi Youei'). The answer is the contents of v. 74 of the Sanskrit manuscripts (one Prof. Minayeff's own, the other the Cambridge Manuscript, Bendall Cat., p. 31). But as this verse is not found in the Tibetan translation, and is of different metre from the surrounding verses (indeed the only common cloka in the whole poem), and as these Sanskrit manuscripts are, in other respects, very defective, the reviewer would prefer to see in the above story only a further proof that this verse is interpolated. It occurs, as already pointed out by Prof. Minayeff, in vol. ii. p. 276 of the same Journal, in the Subh\u0101shit\u0101vali (in B\u00f6htlingk's Ind. Spr. 6225), and is probably a verse of unknown authorship current among Buddhists and other saints. What is the meaning of Ming Guan, and would Itsing not know a man of Candragomin's importance and his works?\n\nThis letter, then, is a poem of 115 resp. 114 vv. (the Tibetan translation has two more, one between v. 63 and v. 64 of the Sanskrit text, and one between v. 69 and v. 70), in different metres, whose chief subject is the misery of being, written in a florid style with a superfluity of epithets.\n\nAfter an introduction of eighteen verses in praise of 'the three Jewels' the author goes on (v. 19): \"Entering this ill-smelling abode of birth, which is filled with heaps of impurity, is very narrow, and is pervaded by dense darkness, as into some hell, he has to endure great misery with crushed limbs.\"\n\nThen follow verses on the misery of age, which, enfeebling all man's faculties, sets its foot on his head against his will and drives him on as a cornac the elephant by the hook of its wrinkles (v. 25). Then he will repent of what he did and did not do (v. 30), for then the messengers of Yama will take him by the hair and carry him before the judge (v. 33\u201334).\n\n1 According to the Cha-gati-dipan\u012b (a P\u0101li work translated from Sanskrit, of\nNext follows in our poem the description of tortures of the Pretas (vv. 35\u201340); they see water from afar, but at their approach it turns into mud, the pleasing shades of the forest turn into burning flames, the sea into a waste; the clouds rain down for them not drops of water but darts and stones; even the wind burns them, even the fire freezes them; their mouth is like the eye of a needle, their belly many yojanas wide; if they try to drink the ocean dries up.\\(^1\\) Verses 41\u201360 give the picture of the pains of hell; not the eight great hells, but only the four vestibules of hell (nirayass\u2019 ussad\u0101) being described here; these are (1) the pit of excrements; (2) the burning coals; (3) the forest with sword-leaved trees; (4) the river Vaitara\u1e47\u012b (comp. the Fr. Ep. vv. 71, 72; and especially Pa\u00f1ca Gati Dipana, ed. Feer, J.P.T.S. 1884, v. 22 sq.). Prof. Minayeff quotes the Nemij\u0101taka, of which he has published a Russian translation, and the Mah\u0101vastu, vol. i. p. 12. A G\u016bth\u0101niraya is mentioned in the commentary to the Dhammapada, ed. Fausb\u00f6ll, p. 408, and the same pains of hell are described in the Asht\u0101ksha\u1e47a-kath\u0101,\\(^2\\) ascribed to N\u0101g\u0101rjuna (the Tibetan translation of which is in the same volume of the Tanjur). The difficulty of obtaining birth as a man and the \u2018unfavourable moments\u2019 are touched upon in vv. 61\u201363, the transitoriness of life in v. 65 sq., the vanity of earthly pleasures and pursuits in vv. 67\u201371; the sense-objects (vishaya) are described as worse than poison (visha) in vv. 72\u201376. But also the gods must die, and \u00c7akra must undergo new births (vv. 77\u201386); here again the chief points are the same as in the Fr. Ep. v. 98 sq., also 70 sq.; the Mand\u0101kin\u012b and the elastic ground of Mount Meru recur here (v. 79). Then follows the admonition in v. 87: \u201cAs far as you form the thought (sa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101) that this whole world is happiness, the worse the darkness of ignorance will grow, but as far as you form the thought of pain in\n\n\\(^1\\) Comp. on this point also the \u2018Friendly Epistle\u2019 (perhaps \u2018Epistle to a Friend\u2019 would be more accurate) of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, \u2018Journal of the P\u0101li T.S.\u2019 1886, v. 91 sq.\n\n\\(^2\\) \u2018Description of the eight unfavourable moments,\u2019 see Fr. Ep. v. 64.\nregard to this whole world, so far the darkness of ignorance will grow thin.\"\n\n88. \"As far as meditation on pleasing objects is indulged in, so much the more will spread the flame of lust; as far as meditation on unpleasing objects is exercised, so much will the flame of lust decrease.\"\u00b9\n\nI have translated this according to the Tibetan; in the Sanskrit, as printed here, two padas have been lost (87c, 88d), and the rest transposed.\n\nTo exert one's self in the interest of others is the true way of salvation (v. 90 sq.); for those that are overcome by thirst in the desert be thou a tree, a cloud, a pond (v. 109 sq.). Finally the author closes with the wish that all the world may obtain omniscience (v. 112 sq.).\n\nProfessor Minayeff has rendered a fresh service to the history of the variations of early Buddhist belief by the publication of this little poem. H. Wenzel.\n\n\u00b9 The last words in the original are not quite clear to me (shin tu rtse zhil hgyur), but must mean something to this effect.\nALPHABETICAL LIST OF AUTHORS.\n\nBrowne.

It is already certain that they were all put into their present form within a very limited period, probably extending to less than a century and a half (about B.C. 400\u2013250). For that period they have preserved for us a record, quite uncontaminated by filtration through any European mind, of the every-day beliefs and customs of a people nearly related to ourselves, just as they were passing through the first stages of civilization. They are our best authorities for the early history of that interesting system of religion so nearly allied to some of the latest speculations among ourselves, and which has influenced so powerfully, and for so long a time, so great a portion of the human race\u2014the system of religion which we now call Buddhism. The sacred books of the early Buddhists have preserved to us the sole record of the only religious\nmovement in the world's history which bears any close resemblance to early Christianity. In the history of speech they contain unimpeachable evidence of a stage in language midway between the Vedic Sanskrit and the various modern forms of speech in India. In the history of Indian literature there is nothing older than these works, excepting only the Vedic writings; and all the later classical Sanskrit literature has been profoundly influenced by the intellectual struggle of which they afford the only direct evidence. It is not, therefore, too much to say that the publication of this unique literature will be no less important for the study of history\u2014whether anthropological, philological, literary, or religious\u2014than the publication of the Vedas has already been.\n\nThe whole will occupy about nine or ten thousand pages 8vo. Of these 4000 pages have already appeared. The accession of about fifty new members would make it possible to issue 1000 pages every year.\n\nThe Subscription to the Society is only One Guinea a year, or Five Guineas for six years, payable in advance. Each subscriber receives, post free, the publications of the Society, which cost a good deal more than a guinea to produce.\n\nIt is hoped that persons who are desirous to aid the publication of these important historical texts, but who do not themselves read P\u0101li, will give Donations to be spread if necessary over a term of years. Nearly \u00a3400 has already been thus given to the Society by public-spirited friends of historical research.\n\n* * * Subscriptions for 1889 are now due, and it is earnestly requested that subscribers will send in their payments without putting the Chairman to the expense and trouble of personally asking for them. All who can conveniently do so should send the Five Guineas for six years, to their own benefit and that of the Society also.\n\nThe Society keeps no books, and its publications cannot in any case be sent to subscribers who have not already paid their subscriptions for the year.\n\nCheques and Post Office Orders should be made payable to the \"Pali Text Society.\" (Address: 22, Albemarle Street, London, W.)\nLIST OF THE MEMBERS\n\nOF THE\n\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY\n\nOF\n\nGREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND:\n\nFOUNDED, March, 1823.\n\nCORRECTED TO OCTOBER, 1889.\n\n22, ALBEMARLE STREET,\nLONDON.\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY.\n\nPATRON:\nHER MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY THE QUEEN.\n\nVICE-PATRONS:\nHIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES.\nTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.\n\nPRESIDENT:\nSIR THOMAS F.
